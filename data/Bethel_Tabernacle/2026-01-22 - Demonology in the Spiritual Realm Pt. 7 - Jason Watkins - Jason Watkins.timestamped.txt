[39:15] and let you be seated.
[39:19] I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,
[39:23] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[39:26] vocation wherewith ye are called, with
[39:30] all loneliness and meekness,
[39:33] with longsuffering,
[39:35] forbearing one another in love,
[39:38] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[39:42] spirit in the bond of peace. There is
[39:45] one body and one spirit. Even as you are
[39:49] called in one hope of your calling, one
[39:52] Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God
[39:55] and Father of all, who is above all and
[39:58] through all and in you all.
[40:02] Now,
[40:04] it's amazing that in the continuation of
[40:07] of our reading,
[40:09] it's very clear in these first six
[40:12] verses, it should be clear to you by now
[40:14] that Paul is speaking to born again
[40:18] believers
[40:19] &gt;&gt; who are he says that full of the spirit
[40:21] of God, one God and father of all who is
[40:24] above all and through all and in you
[40:26] all. So, is there any doubt this these
[40:29] are believers? But yet he's going to go
[40:32] on down in our reading as we continue
[40:34] after we pray and seat you. And he's
[40:37] going to start talking about the
[40:39] necessity
[40:40] uh to to come into the unity of the
[40:43] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[40:45] God and unto a perfect man under the
[40:48] stature under under the measure of the
[40:51] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[40:54] we hence be no more tossed about like
[40:56] children.
[40:58] And he's talking to born again people.
[41:00] Amen.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; All right, let's pray.
[41:03] Father, we thank you for your word. And
[41:07] I just am eager, Lord, to get into the
[41:10] material tonight. And so, Father, we're
[41:14] just calling you on the scene and asking
[41:15] you now to be with us, everyone. We have
[41:19] number of sick requests that have come
[41:20] in tonight. And so, we're asking for
[41:22] your mercy for them, Lord. And we'll
[41:24] take up prayer requests just shortly in
[41:27] a more expansive way. But for now Lord
[41:29] may you help us and reveal the word to
[41:32] us. These are important hour important
[41:34] time that we live in. So we commit it to
[41:36] you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless. You
[41:39] can be seated.
[41:46] All right let's carry on in our reading
[41:48] verse seven.
[41:51] But unto every one of us is given grace
[41:54] according to the measure of the gift of
[41:56] Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he
[42:00] ascended up on high, he led captivity
[42:03] captive, and gave gifts unto men.
[42:07] Now that he ascended, what is it? But
[42:11] that he also descended first into the
[42:13] lower parts of the earth. He that
[42:16] descended is the same also that ascended
[42:19] up far above all heavens that he might
[42:23] fill all things.
[42:26] And he gave some apostles. Now he's
[42:27] going to he's going to break down the
[42:29] gifts. He gave gifts unto men. We just
[42:31] read that. And he he led captivity
[42:34] captive and gave gifts unto men. Now the
[42:36] reason that he gave part of the reason
[42:40] he gave these gifts unto men is
[42:42] expressed in that seventh verse. He unto
[42:45] every one of us is given grace according
[42:47] to the measure of the gift of Christ. So
[42:50] we're all different.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; But we all have one faith, one Lord, one
[42:55] baptism, one spirit. We're gifted
[42:58] severally. We're, you know, we're, you
[43:01] know, different in our nature, different
[43:03] in our temperaments. You know, we're
[43:06] we're different in our gender. We're
[43:07] different in our zodiac. We're different
[43:09] in our raising. We're different in our
[43:11] culture. and and but yet we're all one
[43:13] spirit, one faith, one body. So So the
[43:18] way that he's going to bring all of
[43:20] these these
[43:23] various parts that are all supposed to
[43:26] fit together, only nobody knows how to
[43:29] fit them together. So, he's going to
[43:31] bring forth the Holy Spirit, give us a
[43:34] new birth, and then send forth ministry
[43:37] of the word to to put it all together
[43:40] everywhere where it's supposed to go and
[43:42] fit it close together so that we operate
[43:45] as one unified body of Christ. G God
[43:51] dwelt in the unified body of Jesus
[43:55] Christ.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; And that's always the goal. Just because
[43:59] that there were 120 on the in the upper
[44:03] room and then 3,000 and then thousands
[44:05] more and then it spread to all the
[44:07] world. HE STILL WANTS IT. His goal has
[44:10] always been to get oneness.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; To reestablish
[44:15] oneness.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; And so he says and he gave some apostles
[44:18] and some prophets and some evangelists
[44:20] and some pastors and teachers. Now catch
[44:22] it. Catch it. These bornagain people
[44:25] full of the Holy Spirit, but they still
[44:28] need this ministry for the perfecting of
[44:32] the saints,
[44:34] &gt;&gt; for the work of the ministry, for the
[44:36] edifying of the body of Christ, till we
[44:40] all come into the unity of the faith and
[44:42] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[44:43] a perfect man, unto the measure of the
[44:46] stature of the fullness of Christ. Why?
[44:50] that we henceforth be no more children
[44:53] tossed to and fro, carried about with
[44:56] every wind of doctrine by the slight OF
[44:58] MEN. YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT COULD
[45:00] HAPPEN.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THE OLD THING IS JUST GUESS
[45:04] JUST JUST GET THE HOLY GHOST AND IT FIX
[45:06] ALL THE PROBLEMS.
[45:08] We're finding out that THE HOLY GHOST
[45:11] OPENS YOU UP TO THE HOLY SPIRIT NOW
[45:13] BEING ABLE TO grow you and mature you
[45:17] and bring you INTO THE STATURE OF THE
[45:20] FULLNESS of Christ.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[45:27] That we henceforth be no more children
[45:29] tossed to and fro. carried about with
[45:31] every wind of doctrine by the slight of
[45:33] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[45:35] lay and wait to deceive. But speaking
[45:37] the truth in love, catch this language.
[45:40] May we may grow up into him.
[45:45] GROW UP INTO HIM in all things, which is
[45:49] the head, even Christ, FROM WHOM THE
[45:52] WHOLE BODY FITLY JOINED TOGETHER and
[45:55] compacted
[45:57] by that which EVERY JOINT SUPPLY to each
[46:00] other.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; We're all in this together.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[46:07] EVERY JOINT SUPPLY ACCORDING TO THE
[46:09] effectual working. See, now we're back
[46:12] to verse seven. the effectual working
[46:14] and the measure of every part. It maketh
[46:17] increase of the body UNTO THE EDIFYING
[46:20] OF itself
[46:23] in love. All right. Now, I'm going to
[46:28] invite you to Matthew chapter 18.
[46:34] Matthew chapter 18. We're going to catch
[46:37] these first four verses.
[46:44] Now Paul has just said we've got to grow
[46:47] up into all things so that we're not
[46:50] like children.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[46:54] Now Jesus in Matthew 18 at that at the
[46:57] same time certain at at that at the same
[47:02] time came the disciples unto Jesus
[47:04] saying who is the greatest in the
[47:07] kingdom of heaven?
[47:09] And Jesus called a little child unto
[47:12] him, and set him in the midst of them,
[47:16] and said, Verily, I say unto you, except
[47:19] ye be converted, and become as little
[47:23] children, ye shall not enter into the
[47:26] kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore
[47:30] shall humble himself
[47:33] as this little child, the same is
[47:37] greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; SO HE'S ADVOCATING THAT WE BE SPIRITUAL
[47:43] ADULTS,
[47:46] but in our faith and in our and in our
[47:48] observance of God's word, we act we
[47:51] humble ourselves like little children.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we're going to go
[47:57] somewhere. Now, let me just say
[48:01] that, you know, when you're talking
[48:04] about uh humbling ourselves as children,
[48:08] very little tiny children, very little,
[48:12] don't really have to do that. They don't
[48:13] even, you know, it it it and it takes a
[48:17] very a very young little child uh before
[48:20] they begin to recognize even that they
[48:23] are
[48:25] &gt;&gt; THEY THEY SUDDENLY NOTICE THEIR HANDS.
[48:27] YOU I I seen I remember raising kids AND
[48:30] SUDDENLY YOU SAW THEY NOTICED THEIR
[48:31] HAND. WOW, I HAVE HANDS. AND THEY'RE
[48:33] BECOMING AWARE AND and they they you
[48:36] know BUT BUT WHEN YOU CATCH THEM very
[48:38] young uh somewhere between infant and up
[48:41] to about YOU KNOW IT'S IN MONTHS OLD YOU
[48:44] KNOW NOT QUITE A YEAR SOMETIMES BY THE
[48:46] TIME THEY'RE A YEAR AND A HALF THAT'S
[48:47] WHY THEY CALL THEM terrible twos.
[48:50] Amen. It's okay mothers breathe. You'll
[48:52] get through it. I promise.
[48:55] Brother Eddie said listen grandkids are
[48:57] God's reward for not killing your kids.
[48:59] So, don't just just wait. Amen.
[49:04] But I I was uh I was I was in A IN A
[49:07] PARKING LOT THE other day and and I
[49:10] noticed um just sitting there and Sister
[49:11] Deb had went into a store and I was
[49:13] sitting there and there was a young
[49:14] mother who got out of the car and she
[49:17] went around and she uh took a very small
[49:20] baby. Couldn't have been more than about
[49:21] maybe six months old, six, seven months
[49:23] old at most. AND UH JUST JUST THE KIND
[49:27] THAT YOU WANT TO PINCH THEIR CHEEKS
[49:28] completely off and and she just TAKES
[49:31] THE BABY OUT AND YOU KNOW THE BABY'S
[49:32] JUST okay I'm being lifted out of a car
[49:36] I'M BEING CARRIED THE THE BABY'S NOT
[49:38] SAYING WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHY DID YOU
[49:40] WHY PUT ME DOWN SEE BECAUSE IT'S JUST A
[49:43] VERY LITTLE infant and she's she gets
[49:47] around back she pulls out a stroller you
[49:49] know her husband's coming around this
[49:50] way he's got a couple more little
[49:52] children they're older he's got them by
[49:53] the hand and he's helping her erect the
[49:56] stroller and AND SHE JUST SETS THE
[49:58] LITTLE GUY IN there and and I JUST
[50:00] NOTICED THAT SHE JUST PLOPPED HIM DOWN
[50:02] AND HE JUST, YOU KNOW, HE'S looking
[50:04] around. Okay, this is what we're doing.
[50:07] AND AND I JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, HE
[50:09] DOESN'T EVEN HE'S NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH
[50:11] YET TO KNOW HE HAS A will
[50:13] &gt;&gt; and that MAYBE HE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
[50:16] SEE, NOW, BROTHER BAM TALKS ABOUT THE
[50:18] LANGUAGE OF CRYING. IF THEY'RE HUNGRY,
[50:20] they they cry. That's how that's their
[50:21] language. That's how THEY GET FED. BUT
[50:23] THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS HIM
[50:25] DECIDING, HEY, YOU KNOW, MOM, I CAN I
[50:28] CAN, YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY WANT TO
[50:29] SIT in that. I mean, NOT ONLY IS SHE
[50:31] SETTING HIM IN IT AND HE'S COMPLETELY
[50:34] LIMBER TO IT, SHE'S ACTUALLY READJUSTING
[50:37] HIM AND FIXING HIM AND HE'S JUST LIKE,
[50:38] "OKAY, OKAY, IS THIS GOOD?" You know,
[50:40] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, AND SHE'S GOT HIM
[50:42] AND SHE PUTS HIS LITTLE CAP ON AND HE'S
[50:43] LOOKING around and all of a sudden here
[50:45] she goes into the store. And I just
[50:47] thought about this scripture, Jesus
[50:50] saying, "Except you humble yourself and
[50:54] become like a little child."
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; BY THE TIME THEY'RE ALMOST any age at
[51:00] all, you know, they they don't exactly
[51:03] sometimes they you feel a little bit of
[51:04] resistance when you take them by the
[51:06] hand. Sometimes you have to show some
[51:09] authority. Who's in charge here? But
[51:11] when it's a very LITTLE CHILD, THEY JUST
[51:15] PLOP DOWN WHEREVER YOU SET THEM OR YOU
[51:17] lay them on the bed, they lay there and
[51:19] they just look around. You know, YOU SIT
[51:21] THEM IN A HIGH CHAIR. THEY THEY'RE JUST
[51:22] SITTING THERE. They're waiting and and
[51:24] they AND AND IT'S IT TAKES A LITTLE
[51:26] WHILE FOR THEM TO START TO DEVELOP THEIR
[51:28] OWN LITTLE PERSONALITY BEFORE THEY
[51:30] SUDDENLY REALIZE, I GOT HANDS AND I'M A
[51:32] PERSON AND I THINK THEREFORE I AM AND I
[51:33] got a will and maybe I don't like that
[51:36] and I and I'm going to, you know, I'M
[51:37] GOING TO LET THE PARENT KNOW. BUT WE'RE
[51:39] NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT KIND OF A CHILD.
[51:40] WE'RE TALKING ABOUT a a a little child.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus, I promise you, isn't saying you
[51:47] should be like a rebellious little
[51:48] terrible two.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Some of his children unfortunately are,
[51:54] but you're not supposed to be.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:01] BUT BEFORE THE CHILD IS OLD ENOUGH TO
[52:03] recognize its own desires by I guess by
[52:06] being aware of its own life and its
[52:08] surroundings and as it becomes more
[52:10] self-aware and this then OPENS UP THE
[52:13] CHILD to its own desires and and and and
[52:17] then you can see some resistant to the
[52:19] parent you know when the when the
[52:21] parents direction conflicts with the
[52:26] child's desires All right. Amen.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; All right.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; So, so Jesus said, you know, PAUL IS
[52:36] SAYING, DON'T BE LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN
[52:38] TOSSED ABOUT. THAT THAT'S SPIRITUAL
[52:40] IMMATURITY.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BORN AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD,
[52:43] BUT DON'T BE SPIRITUALLY IMMATURE.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS LOOKING FOR MATURE, A
[52:49] MATURE BRIDE. JESUS WAS NEVER COMING
[52:51] BACK TO MARRY a little girl. HE'S COMING
[52:53] BACK TO MARRY A MATURE BRIDE.
[52:56] UH UH UH ready to BE UH SIT BESIDE HIM
[52:59] ON THE THRONE AND RULE AND REIGN WITH
[53:01] CHRIST. BUT YET WHEN IT COMES TO OUR BUT
[53:05] BUT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR SPIRITUAL
[53:07] MATURITY, A REAL SIGN OF SPIRITUAL
[53:10] MATURITY is a humility to act like a
[53:13] child.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; As it relates to your will
[53:17] &gt;&gt; versus God's will.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:26] Brother Brandham in the message oneness.
[53:29] It was a, you know, he had he had been
[53:32] in he spent, you know, in early 1962,
[53:35] he' he'd just come back in from Arizona
[53:39] and he had been all over Phoenix and
[53:42] Tempe and and preaching and and got home
[53:44] and he tells ON THE TAPE, YOU KNOW, I
[53:46] JUST got home last weekend, last Sunday.
[53:49] HE HE HE GOT INTO JEFFERSONVILLE JUST IN
[53:52] TIME FOR A SUNDAY NIGHT communion
[53:54] service there in the early first weekend
[53:56] of February. And then and then the very
[53:59] next Sunday now he's back in the pull
[54:01] pit. HE SAYS, "NOW LAST week we had
[54:04] communion showing that you KNOW IT'S A
[54:06] IT'S A COMMUNION BUT IT'S FELLOWSHIP.
[54:08] IT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU IN CHRIST.
[54:10] IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT TAKING THE articles
[54:12] of communion."
[54:14] &gt;&gt; And he says BUT NOW TODAY HE SAYS AND HE
[54:16] AND HE GOES ON HE HE HE STARTS TALKING
[54:19] ABOUT HOW THAT HIS SPIRIT IS TROUBLED
[54:22] over the age that he is seeing and he
[54:24] feels VERY MOVED.
[54:27] UH BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. AND HE SAYS,
[54:29] "NOW TODAY I WANT TO COME AND I WANT TO
[54:31] TAKE MY time and I want TO BEGIN TO SHOW
[54:34] YOU BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS EARLY ' 62.
[54:37] THIS IS UH JUST YOU KNOW A LITTLE MORE
[54:40] THAN A YEAR MAYBE 13 or 14 months at
[54:43] most before the nation has already
[54:46] crossed the judgment.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; 56 WAS IT AS A NATION AND AMERICA WAS
[54:52] THE LAST NATION. AND ALL THE OTHER
[54:53] NATIONS ARE ALREADY UNDER JUDGMENT. IN
[54:55] THE 20TH CENTURY, 1956, THE UNITED
[54:58] STATES CROSSES THE LINE BETWEEN JUDGMENT
[54:59] and mercy. Brother Brandham said,
[55:00] "You'll never bring it back. PUT AN
[55:02] ABRAHAM LINCOLN and a GEORGE WASHINGTON
[55:04] IN EVERY COUNTY AND YOU WON'T TURN IT
[55:06] AROUND."
[55:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; BUT YET NOW THE CHURCH IS STILL, YOU
[55:10] KNOW, LIVING ON A SHADOW OF WHAT IT USED
[55:13] TO BE. BUT IT'S LESS THAN 14 MONTHS,
[55:16] MAYBE 15 MONTHS AT THE MOST BEFORE IT'S
[55:19] ABOUT TO CRUCIFY THE WORD OF GOD THE
[55:21] SECOND TIME AND BE INDICTED BY A PROPHET
[55:24] THAT'S GOING TO PUT CHRIST OUT. HE HE'S
[55:26] GOING TO BE OUTSIDE OF HIS OWN CHURCH
[55:28] FOR THE FIRST TIME in 2,000 years.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; SO MUCH SO THAT THEN THE THE CHURCH
[55:35] BECOMES NO LONGER HIS MOUTHPIECE. AND
[55:38] THEREFORE NOW HE'S GOT A A A MESSAGE IN
[55:41] THE LAND CALLING A BRIDE OUT OF
[55:43] ORGANIZED RELIGION BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO
[55:46] HAVE A MOUTHPIECE.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO HAVE A BRIDE. AND IF THE
[55:51] CHURCH KICKS HIM OUT, HE'LL CALL HIS
[55:52] BRIDE OUT WITH HIM AND SHE'LL COME OUT
[55:54] WITH HIM EVERY TIME.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:58] AND SO HE HE TAKES HIS TEXT OUT OF OVER
[56:02] IN IN HEBREWS, you know, GOD WHO AT
[56:05] SUNDAY times and and you know, AND AND
[56:07] AND TIMES PAST AND SPOKE TO THE um
[56:10] through the prophets AND AND BROTHER
[56:12] BRANDHAM IS BRINGING ON DOWN HOW HE NOW
[56:14] HE'S SPOKEN TO HIS BY HIS SON WHO'S HE'S
[56:16] BEEN MADE HEIR OF ALL THINGS who express
[56:18] image of his person and upholding ALL
[56:20] THE THINGS BY THE WORD OF HIS POWER AND
[56:23] HOW HE'S seated and risen TO THE THRONE.
[56:26] AND THEN HE DOUBLES BACK TO GENESIS 1.
[56:29] LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE AFTER OUR
[56:31] LIKENESS AND LET HIM HAVE DOMINION. AND
[56:34] SO NOW HE'S SHOWING THAT CHRIST HAS COME
[56:37] AND HAS BEEN ELEVATED. AND WHAT'S WHAT'S
[56:40] THE GOAL? WHAT'S THE ENDGAME? IS TO TURN
[56:43] EVERYTHING AND GO BACK AND TAKE HIS
[56:45] FAMILY BACK TO WHERE GOD WALKED WITH HIM
[56:48] IN THE COOL OF THE DAY. WHERE HIS FAMILY
[56:51] HAD DOMINION OVER ALL CREATION.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:55] AND THERE WAS NO IMMATURITY IN ADAM, NO
[56:58] DISOBEDIENCE IN ADAM. HE DID ALWAYS THAT
[57:01] WHICH PLEASED THE FATHER.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; THE SECOND ADAM DID THAT. THE FIRST ADAM
[57:05] DID THAT AS WELL.
[57:07] SEE,
[57:09] SO HE HIS HIS WHOLE POINT IS NOW THAT
[57:12] GOD HAS SENT A WORD IN THIS DAY TO
[57:16] RESTORE US BACK to oneness
[57:21] &gt;&gt; where the body of Christ and Christ
[57:24] become Mr. and Mrs. Jesus
[57:27] where she is him.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; It's not literally him. She didn't You
[57:34] didn't die for me. UH YOU I DON'T GET
[57:37] BAPTIZED IN YOUR NAME.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SO, BUT BUT IT BUT
[57:41] HEBREWS 13:8 GIVES US THE KEY TO THE
[57:44] STATEMENT. SHE IS HIM. THREE WORDS. SHE
[57:48] IS HIM. HEBREWS 13:8 EXPLAINS IT. JESUS
[57:52] CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND
[57:54] FOREVER. SHE'S NOT LITERALLY HIM. SHE'S
[57:56] THE same as him.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; You understand? HE'S THE BEGINNING OF
[58:00] THE CREATION OF GOD. THE BRIDE IS THE
[58:02] CONTINUATION OF THAT SAME CREATION. IT'S
[58:05] JUST EXTRAPOLATION AND IT'S STILL GOING
[58:07] AND IT'S BEEN GOING FOR 2,000 YEARS AND
[58:09] IT'S ABOUT TO BE WRAPPED UP.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; I'M IN THAT NUMBER. ARE YOU IN THAT
[58:13] NUMBER?
[58:16] &gt;&gt; SO, WE HAVE THESE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE
[58:18] FACING and and and AND THE CHURCH WAS
[58:22] GETTING READY TO CROSS A LINE THAT THEY
[58:24] COULDN'T COME BACK FROM. AND AND BROTHER
[58:26] BRANDHAM SAYS, "I'M I'M VERY MUCH
[58:28] CONCERNED WITH THE TIME THAT WE'RE
[58:29] LIVING IN. I'M VERY," HE SAYS, "VERY,
[58:31] VERY VERY MUCH concerned when I see the
[58:34] things happening. I SEE THEM TAKING
[58:36] PLACE AND THERE'S SOMETHING WITHIN ME
[58:38] that's stirred." AND SO HE HE'S GOING TO
[58:42] BREAK THIS SERMON DOWN, HOW THAT a true
[58:46] believer,
[58:47] YOU KNOW, UH HE'S GOING TO GIVE US THE
[58:49] PATH. HOW DO WE GET BACK TO ONENESS? ONE
[58:50] OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT HE'S GOING TO
[58:52] LAY OUT IS THAT A TRUE BELIEVER WILL NOT
[58:55] COMPROMISE on any word of God. BECAUSE
[58:58] TO DOUBT ONE WORD OF GOD IS TO ACCEPT
[59:01] THE DEVIL'S LIE AND YOU BREAK THE CHAIN.
[59:05] Immediately you BREAK THE CHAIN. AS SOON
[59:07] AS YOU DOUBT GOD'S WORD, THEN YOU BREAK
[59:09] THE CHAIN. AND PEOPLE EVEN EVEN GOD'S
[59:11] FAMILY SOMETIMES GET IN IN A HORRIBLE
[59:14] FIX. WONDER WHY DID GOD LET LET ME GET
[59:16] HERE? GOD IS STANDING THERE GOING, "GET
[59:19] BACK ON THE PATH."
[59:22] &gt;&gt; WHY'D YOU LET ME GET DOWN HERE? I
[59:23] DIDN'T. BUT YOU'RE YOU WALKED OFF THE
[59:26] PATH. NOW GET BACK ON THE PATH.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; WILL YOU HELP ME? I'LL HELP YOU. BUT
[59:30] THIS TIME, STAY ON IT ALREADY.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; SEE?
[59:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; SO, HE GOES ON TO SHOW THAT THE WAY BACK
[59:39] COULD NEVER BE intellectual wisdom. And
[59:42] I REALLY WANT THAT CLEAR TONIGHT. THE
[59:45] WAY BACK, AS BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD
[59:47] DESCRIBE IT, COULD NEVER be intellectual
[59:50] wisdom, but it had TO BE THROUGH A TOTAL
[59:54] UNCOMPROMISING
[59:56] ADHERENCE to God's word and the
[59:59] indwelling of the Holy Ghost. He makes
[1:00:02] that so clear in that oneness message
[1:00:06] to brother Brham. PERFECT ONENESS WAS
[1:00:09] NOT MERELY mental agreement
[1:00:13] with the word,
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A SPIRITUAL UNION
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; WHERE ALMIGHTY GOD LIVES INSIDE THE
[1:00:22] PERSON.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; SEE?
[1:00:27] WELL, AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY. BECAUSE
[1:00:29] WITHOUT THAT, any works you did would
[1:00:31] just be man-made works.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; See? and and even and AND THEY MIGHT BE
[1:00:36] NOBLE WORKS BUT EVEN IF NOBLE THEY COULD
[1:00:39] NOT UH GIVE ETERNAL LIFE BACK TO FALLEN
[1:00:43] HUMANITY. See friends, REFORMATION
[1:00:47] WITHOUT REGENERATION IS STILL DEATH.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; REFORMATION WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS
[1:00:54] SUNDAY. REFORMATION WITHOUT REGENERATION
[1:00:57] IS STILL DEATH.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND? SO, SO YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN
[1:01:03] WHEN HE DEFINES ONENESS WITH GOD AS
[1:01:08] HAVING GOD'S SPIRIT IN you and agreeing
[1:01:10] with the word and THEN THE THIRD THING
[1:01:13] THAT WILL BE AN EVIDENCE THAT HIS SPIRIT
[1:01:15] IS in you and that you agree with the
[1:01:17] word IS THAT YOU WILL MANIFEST HIS KIND
[1:01:21] OF POWER HIS KIND OF LIFE. WE'RE NOT
[1:01:23] TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WALKING ON
[1:01:25] WATER. IF THAT'S IF THAT'S WHAT HE
[1:01:27] DECIDES FOR YOU, THEN YOU'LL WALK ACROSS
[1:01:29] THE ENTIRE PACIFIC OCEAN AND BACK. BUT
[1:01:31] THAT'S NOT IT. BUT DO YOU HAVE POWER TO
[1:01:34] ALWAYS DO THAT WHICH PLEASES THE FATHER?
[1:01:37] AND IF THE ENEMY COMES IN, DO YOU HAVE
[1:01:39] POWER TO CAST HIM OUT? DO YOU OPERATE
[1:01:42] THE POWER OF LOOSING AND BINDING? I'M
[1:01:44] HERE TO TELL YOU, WHEN YOU HAVE A LIFE
[1:01:46] FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST AND YOU LIVE AN
[1:01:48] ADHERENCE TO EVERY WORD, THEN EVERY
[1:01:50] DEVIL IS AFRAID OF YOU, NOT THE OTHER
[1:01:53] WAY AROUND.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:56] AMEN.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS SAID UNTO THEM,
[1:02:01] "VERILY I SAY TO YOU," THIS IS MATTHEW
[1:02:02] 19:28, "THAT YE WHICH HAVE FOLLOWED me
[1:02:08] in the regeneration
[1:02:11] WHEN THE SON OF MAN."
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; YES. CORRECT.
[1:02:21] SO HE SAYS JESUS SAID, "VERILY I SAY
[1:02:24] UNTO YOU THAT YE WHICH HAVE FOLLOWED ME
[1:02:27] in the regeneration
[1:02:29] when THE SON OF MAN SHALL SIT IN THE
[1:02:31] THRONE OF HIS GLORY, YE ALSO SHALL SIT
[1:02:35] UPON 12 THRONES JUDGING THE 12 TRIBES OF
[1:02:37] ISRAEL." SO TO FOLLOW CHRIST, AND I WANT
[1:02:42] TO SAY IT LIKE THIS, YOU MUST follow
[1:02:45] Christ in in the regeneration
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; or you're nowhere. YOU'RE NOT EVEN OUT
[1:02:49] OF THE GATE
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVEN'T FOLLOWED HIM IN THE
[1:02:52] REGENERATION.
[1:02:53] BECAUSE REMEMBER, REFORMATION WITHOUT RE
[1:02:57] REGENERATION IS STILL DEATH.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AND SO WHEN WE HAVE
[1:03:02] FOLLOWED HIM TO FOLLOW CHRIST IN THE
[1:03:05] REGENERATION
[1:03:07] without a willingness FOR DAILY
[1:03:12] TRANSFORMATION
[1:03:13] BY THE APPLICATION OF THE WORD, IT'S
[1:03:17] STILL IMMATURITY. AMEN.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; AND PAUL SAID, "I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
[1:03:21] like children, immature, tossed about."
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID, "YOU GOT TO HUMBLE YOURSELF.
[1:03:27] BE LIKE A CHILD IN THAT YOU HUMBLE
[1:03:29] YOURSELF TO EVERY WORD OF GOD." BECAUSE
[1:03:32] THIS IS THE REAL RUB. WE HAVE OUR OWN
[1:03:34] WILL. WE HAVE OUR OWN WAY. AND A LOT OF
[1:03:36] TIMES THE PARENTS WILL AND THE CHILD'S
[1:03:39] WILL CONFLICT.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; BUT IF THE CHILD WANTS TO STAY HEALTHY,
[1:03:43] FED, AND DRY, IT NEEDS TO FOLLOW THE
[1:03:45] WILL OF THE PARENT. YOU HAVE A HEAVENLY
[1:03:49] PARENT.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:03:53] SO SO REFORMATION WITHOUT REGENERATION
[1:03:56] IS STILL DEATH. BUT EVEN IF YOU COME
[1:03:58] THROUGH THE REGENERATION,
[1:04:00] BUT IF YOU DO THAT WITHOUT A FIRM
[1:04:03] COMMITMENT TO A DAILY TRANSFORMATION
[1:04:06] BY APPLYING
[1:04:08] THE WORD, WE APPLY THE TOKEN. THAT'S NOT
[1:04:12] A A WORD SALAD. APPLY the token. THAT
[1:04:16] MEANS TO BRING SOMETHING IN CONTACT
[1:04:18] WITH. PARENTS APPLY THE TOKEN TO THEIR
[1:04:21] HOME. THAT MEANS THE CHILDREN COME INTO
[1:04:24] CONTACT WITH THE token in their home.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. See,
[1:04:29] SO CLAIMING TO HAVE A DESIRE FOR
[1:04:32] TRANSFORMATION AND I WOULD DARE SAY EVEN
[1:04:35] TO PRAY AND ASK THE LORD TO GROW YOU,
[1:04:37] BUT WITHOUT A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN
[1:04:42] DAILY WARFARE
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; AND TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH.
[1:04:47] YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO
[1:04:48] OVERCOME? YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO OVERCOME
[1:04:50] THAT VULNERABILITY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT
[1:04:52] a couple of services ago. THAT BEING A
[1:04:55] HUMAN YOU YOU'RE VULNERABLE BECAUSE YOU
[1:04:58] HAVE CHOICE
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S A HUMAN VULNERABILITY THAT
[1:05:02] YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY DAILY SURRENDER
[1:05:05] TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. THIS IS WHY THIS
[1:05:08] MATERIAL IS SO RELEVANT TO DEMONOLOGY
[1:05:11] BECAUSE EVERY DEMON OUT OF HELL WHO HE
[1:05:15] HE CANNOT DECEIVE YOU. SO HE TRIES TO
[1:05:18] HINDER YOU FROM BECOMING EVERYTHING THAT
[1:05:20] GOD WANTS YOU TO BE IN HIS WORD BECAUSE
[1:05:22] AS YOU ARE BECOMING THE WORD THAT'S
[1:05:24] SOMEDAY GOING TO BRING THE SAINTS OUT OF
[1:05:26] THE GRAVE.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; SO BROTHER BRANDHAM TAUGHT US AS THE
[1:05:30] CAPSTONE IS COMING DOWN AND THAT BRIDE
[1:05:32] AND CHRIST BECOME SO INTO ONE TILL THE
[1:05:34] GRAVES AND THE DEAD FOR HUNDREDS OF
[1:05:36] YEARS WILL COME. SEE,
[1:05:40] SO JUST AS DESIRING THE CHARACTER OF
[1:05:44] CHRIST, BUT YOU HAVE NO WILLINGNESS TO
[1:05:47] SUFFER WITH CHRIST,
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; that's a non-starter
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; with God.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; You understand? See, NOW LISTEN FRIENDS,
[1:05:56] THIS KIND OF PREACHING IS, YOU KNOW, I I
[1:05:58] I JUST WANT TO I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU
[1:06:00] THAT
[1:06:01] THIS KIND OF PREACHING AND TEACHING,
[1:06:05] HOWEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THIS SEVEN-PART
[1:06:07] SERIES, IT'S VERY PURPOSE- DRIVEN. AND
[1:06:09] AND THE AND THE PURPOSE, THE BEST WAY I
[1:06:11] CAN DESCRIBE IT TO YOU IS I'M NOT HERE,
[1:06:13] FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE YOU
[1:06:15] COMFORTABLE.
[1:06:16] I'M HERE TO CONFRONT I'M HERE TO
[1:06:19] CONFRONT DEMON SPIRITS.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; That anoint PEOPLE WITH SUPERFICIAL
[1:06:25] CHRISTIANITY.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; And these things a lot of times live too
[1:06:33] close to us, too close in our homes, too
[1:06:36] close in our daily lives. AND I'M NOT
[1:06:38] HERE SAYING I FOLLOW YOU AROUND AND I
[1:06:40] SEE IT IN TOO MANY'S LIVES. I LOOK IN
[1:06:42] THE MIRROR AND I GO, "YOU BOY, YOU'RE
[1:06:44] YOU GOT TOO MUCH SUPERFICIAL GOING ON
[1:06:46] HERE. YOU NEED TO HAVE A YOU NEED TO BE
[1:06:48] MATURE BY HUMBLING YOURSELF LIKE A
[1:06:50] CHILD."
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; SO, I WANT TO TAKE IT HEAD ON AND and
[1:06:56] the and the whole reason IS, FRIENDS, IS
[1:06:58] TO CALL US TO A HIGHER FULLNESS IN THE
[1:07:01] POWER OF GOD. I WANT TO SEE US OPERATE
[1:07:03] IN THOSE HEAVENLY ATMOSPHERES. HOW ABOUT
[1:07:05] YOU? DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR FAMILIES
[1:07:08] AND YOUR HOMES AND YOUR CHURCHES AND
[1:07:09] YOUR CHILDREN? WE WANT TO OPERATE IN
[1:07:11] THOSE HIGH ATMOSPHERES.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S A GREAT DESIRE OF MY HEART. SEE,
[1:07:17] AND SO, YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT REALLY
[1:07:19] EVEN WHAT I WOULD CALL TEACHING
[1:07:21] DOCTRINE, BUT IT'S IT'S MORE DIAGNOSING
[1:07:24] A SPIRITUAL CONDITION of the age that we
[1:07:26] live in.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; But God has a prescription and a cure.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; AND SO, IF MY IF MY TONE SOUNDS URGENT,
[1:07:36] THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE IT IS. YES.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; If it's BEEN URGENT OVER SEVEN
[1:07:40] INSTALLMENTS, IT'S BECAUSE I FEEL
[1:07:43] URGENT. YOU KNOW, I I THERE THERE
[1:07:45] THERE'S A THERE'S A CRISIS OF OF OF doom
[1:07:48] that is THAT IS GROWING AND IT'S GROWING
[1:07:50] EXPONENTIALLY. BROTHER MATT SMITH WAS
[1:07:52] JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT IN THE SUNDAY
[1:07:53] SCHOOL LAST WEEKEND. YOU KNOW, THAT THAT
[1:07:56] EVEN AMONG THE CONSERVATIVE CONSERVATIVE
[1:07:58] conservatism
[1:08:00] and AND THEY'RE EVEN SAYING THAT IT IT'S
[1:08:02] WHAT ACTUALLY ELECTED TRUMP. YOU KNOW,
[1:08:04] JUST LIKE THE VOTE OF THE WOMEN ELECTED
[1:08:07] JOHN KENNEDY
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; ON ON THE DEMOCRATIC LIBERAL SIDE AND
[1:08:11] NOW THE VOTE OF YOUNG MEN HAVE ELECTED
[1:08:14] DONALD TRUMP AND IS WHAT PUT HIM WITH
[1:08:16] ALL THOSE EXTRA MILLIONS AND WHY IT WAS
[1:08:18] SUCH A LANDSLIDE. HE LIKELY WOULD HAVE
[1:08:19] WON ANYWAY. BUT BUT BUT IT WAS SUCH A
[1:08:22] LANDSLIDE THAT IT WAS OVERWHELMING. IT
[1:08:24] WAS HISTORIC THE AMOUNT HE WON BY AND
[1:08:27] THE POPULAR VOTE AND THE AND THE AND the
[1:08:30] and and and the and my goodness the the
[1:08:32] electoral college and IT WAS IT WAS
[1:08:34] CONSIDERED A A THROTTLING OF THE OTHER
[1:08:36] SIDE AND BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE OF
[1:08:39] CONGRESS, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
[1:08:40] THE SENATE WON ALL OF THAT.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; And what IS IT? IT'S IT WAS YOUNG MEN
[1:08:46] FEELING ENTHUSED AND AND NOW THEY'RE ALL
[1:08:50] Christians
[1:08:52] and AND AND AS I WAS AS I WAS EXPLAINING
[1:08:54] LAST TIME, I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THIS
[1:08:56] THIS KIND OF A PATH AGAIN. WE'VE COVERED
[1:08:58] IT BEFORE, BUT IT'S JUST ALL SUPERFICIAL
[1:09:01] BECAUSE THEY GLORIFY GOD IN ONE MINUTE
[1:09:03] AND WITHIN 30 SECONDS THEY'RE DROPPING
[1:09:05] SWEAR WORDS.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; And they they they AND YOU CAN SEE THAT
[1:09:10] THEY HAVE NO COMPULSION AT ALL TO NOT DO
[1:09:12] THAT. IT'S AS NATURAL AS BREATHING.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; THAT AND THAT IS SUPERFICIAL. THAT'S THE
[1:09:18] DECEPTION THAT SATAN HAS SWN OVER THE
[1:09:22] WORLD.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; SEE, AND AND THE THING ABOUT IT IS
[1:09:26] FRIENDS THAT THAT THAT THAT THE PIED
[1:09:29] PIPER IS IS GATHERING THEM ALONG WITH
[1:09:31] THE UNWISE VIRGIN WHO ARE SEEKING THE
[1:09:34] OIL. AND AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A LOT OF
[1:09:37] SOMETIMES THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE REVIVAL.
[1:09:39] THAT FOOLISH VIRGIN ARE SEEKING THE OIL
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IS GETTING
[1:09:43] CAUGHT UP IN THAT HYSTERIA AND THEY'RE
[1:09:45] ALL CHRISTIANS AND IT'S ALL IT'S THEY'RE
[1:09:47] NOT CHRISTIANS.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; CHRISTIAN MEANS TO BE CHRISTLIKE.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; SEE, AND SO IT'S A IT'S APPROACHING AN
[1:09:55] INFLECTION POINT UH TO A PERMANENT
[1:09:58] TRANSITION THAT HUMANITY IS NOT GOING TO
[1:10:00] BE ABLE TO COME BACK FROM. THEY'VE GOT A
[1:10:02] LITTLE BIT OF AN OPPORTUNITY WHILE THE
[1:10:03] BRIDE IS STILL HERE.
[1:10:06] OH, HOW WE OUGHT TO BE ON FIRE IN THE
[1:10:08] ATMOSPHERES OF GOD. HOW WE OUGHT TO BE
[1:10:10] HAVE A LIFE WORTHY OF THE GOSPEL. YOU'RE
[1:10:13] THE LAST VOICE. YOU'RE THE LAST HOPE.
[1:10:15] ONCE IT CROSSES THAT LAST INFLECTION
[1:10:17] POINT AND THE BRIDE LEAVES, THERE'S NO
[1:10:19] MORE MERCY FOR THE WORLD.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; AND IT PLUNGES HEADLONG INTO A
[1:10:23] TRIBULATION PERIOD.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; My
[1:10:28] many inflection points in prophecy have
[1:10:29] already been crossed. And you KNOW TH
[1:10:32] THIS AS I CALLED IT SUNDAY THIS
[1:10:34] SYNTHETIC IMPERSONATION OF CHRISTIANITY.
[1:10:37] It's a trap.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; It's a trap according as I said to you
[1:10:43] Sunday. If the book of revelation is to
[1:10:45] be believed
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; now if you don't okay but if the book of
[1:10:49] revelation is to be believed it's a trap
[1:10:51] that will lead them to the mark of the
[1:10:53] beast
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; and destruction in the tribulation
[1:10:56] sadly. And I say that sadly.
[1:11:00] Oh, why were we we are still here and
[1:11:03] they still have a chance. Oh, friends, I
[1:11:06] I feel like I want to say with Paul, I I
[1:11:09] must I must not cease to warn every man.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; With urgency, thank God for the revealed
[1:11:18] word of the hour.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Thank God for spiritual eyesight
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; that we're able to overcome. say, "I
[1:11:27] DON'T ALWAYS FEEL LIKE MUCH OF AN
[1:11:28] OVERCOMER." THE ONLY OVERCOMING THAT GOD
[1:11:31] IS LOOKING FOR YOU to overcome is to
[1:11:34] overcome the deception to the age.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? JESUS ALREADY OVERCAME
[1:11:40] ON BEHALF OF your life.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; YOU GET HIM INSIDE YOU AND THEN YOU GET
[1:11:44] FULLY CREDIT FOR ALL OF HIS LIFE. I'M
[1:11:47] HERE TO OVERCOME THE LIE. I'M HERE TO
[1:11:50] OVERCOME THE DECEPTION OF THE AGE THAT'S
[1:11:53] TAKING THE AGE WITH IT. NO WONDER I SAY
[1:11:55] THANK GOD FOR EYES TO SEE.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; SEE, not only NOT ONLY, YOU KNOW, UH THE
[1:12:02] BELIEVER MUST YIELD TO GOD'S VISION FOR
[1:12:05] THEIR FOR THEIR LIFE, YOU KNOW, UH BUT
[1:12:08] BUT I I DON'T WANT TO BE I'M GLAD FOR
[1:12:11] HEARING, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE A HEARER
[1:12:13] ONLY AND NOT A DOER
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; of the word of God.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; See, SO I'M GLAD FOR WHAT GOD HAS DONE
[1:12:21] IN OUR LIVES. THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:12:24] Ghost is what GIVES US THE CAPACITY TO
[1:12:28] be this.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM COMES BACK TO IT
[1:12:32] AGAIN AND AGAIN. He won't do it all for
[1:12:34] you. He's not going to push you through
[1:12:36] a pipe.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; See, the believer must yield to God's
[1:12:43] vision for their lives. I'm going say
[1:12:45] that again. The real believer like a
[1:12:48] child must humble themselves and must
[1:12:52] yield to the vision God has
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; for their life.
[1:12:58] See,
[1:12:59] we are participants. Do you believe
[1:13:02] that?
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; It's all for the perfecting of the
[1:13:05] saints. We read it in our text. It's for
[1:13:07] THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY. IT'S FOR THE
[1:13:09] EDIFYING OF THE BODY OF CHRIST. WHY?
[1:13:11] WHY? WHY? WHY DOES WHY DOES PAUL SAY
[1:13:13] THAT? THAT WE HENCEFORTH BE NO MORE
[1:13:15] CHILDREN TOSSED TO AND FRO. I'D SAY
[1:13:17] THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD REASON.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; SEE, SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN LOVE, WE MAY
[1:13:22] GROW UP INTO HIM. GROW UP INTO HIM IN
[1:13:26] ALL THINGS. AGAIN, HE'S ALREADY TALKING
[1:13:29] TO BORN AGAIN PEOPLE
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; WHO AND HE'S SAYING TO THEM, I WANT YOU
[1:13:33] TO GROW UP INTO HIM IN ALL THINGS.
[1:13:37] THE BODY OF CHRIST. SEE, IT'S THE BODY
[1:13:39] OF CHRIST AND AND THEREFORE IT'S YOUR
[1:13:42] BODY. SO, THE BODY OF CHRIST GLOBALLY,
[1:13:46] BUT YOUR BODY YOUR BODY PHYSICALLY FITLY
[1:13:51] JOINED TOGETHER AND COMPACTED FOR WHAT?
[1:13:54] FOR WHAT? WHY? WHAT? WHY AM WHAT'S MY
[1:13:57] BODY? WHY DOES HE NEED MY BODY? FOR THE
[1:13:59] EFFECTUAL WORKING OF THE MEASURE OF
[1:14:02] EVERY PART MAKETH INCREASE OF THE BODY
[1:14:05] UNTO THE EDIFYING OF ITSELF IN LOVE.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; THIS IS HOW THE GOSPEL ROLLS. THIS IS
[1:14:12] HOW HE ACCOMPLISHES HIS PLAN.
[1:14:16] In love. Not love for the world
[1:14:20] but for the word and for one another.
[1:14:25] So, so when we're covering these kinds
[1:14:30] of things where, you know, you've heard
[1:14:32] it called, you know, nuts and bolts
[1:14:34] preaching, you've heard it called where
[1:14:35] the rubber meets the road. And I I THINK
[1:14:38] THAT'S PROBABLY FAIR OF THE KIND OF
[1:14:40] SERIES THIS HAS BEEN. BUT I I JUST WANT
[1:14:43] TO SAY THAT THAT WHEN I'M PREACHING
[1:14:46] ABOUT OUR LIVES AND WHERE WE LIVE, JUST
[1:14:48] REMEMBER I'M IN IT WITH YOU. YES. AMEN.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; And I'm AND I'M NOT I'M NOT ATTACKING
[1:14:53] PEOPLE. AND CAN I SAY, BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:14:55] WASN'T ATTACKING PEOPLE.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; HE I'M NOT ATTACKING PEOPLE. HE WASN'T
[1:15:00] ATTACKING PEOPLE. WE'RE EXPOSING A
[1:15:03] SYSTEM AND DOCTRINE THAT PRODUCES A
[1:15:07] COUNTERFEIT COMFORT.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE BECOME COMFORTABLE
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; AND THEIR COUNTERFEIT EXPERIENCE.
[1:15:20] SO, I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE YOU
[1:15:21] COMFORTABLE. Is that okay?
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not HERE TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE BY
[1:15:26] TELLING YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE covered if
[1:15:29] if you believe God sent a prophet. THE
[1:15:31] DEVIL BELIEVES THAT. YEAH. I'M NOT HERE
[1:15:32] TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE AND AND SAY,
[1:15:34] "WELL, AS LONG AS YOU believe the
[1:15:37] teachings." Let me tell you something,
[1:15:38] FRIENDS. I IF IF THIS MAKES YOU
[1:15:40] UNCOMFORTABLE, I GOT TO SAY IT ANYWAY.
[1:15:43] YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT NOTHING SHORT OF A
[1:15:46] PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE LORD JESUS
[1:15:49] CHRIST. WELL, IF YOU DON'T GET THAT,
[1:15:51] THEN YOU'LL GO TO YOU'LL TRY TO SERVE
[1:15:53] GOD AND IT WON'T BE VERY FAR. YOU'LL BE
[1:15:56] BROKEN. YOU'LL BE DISILLUSIONED AND
[1:15:58] YOU'LL BE WALKING AWAY WONDERING WHY GOD
[1:16:00] DOESN'T LOVE YOU.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER. That's true.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Satan will eventually you're in church
[1:16:08] and you love God and you believe the
[1:16:10] word and you know what God did in this
[1:16:11] day. But I'm here to tell you, it's got
[1:16:13] to start with an experience with Christ.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, Satan will eventually put
[1:16:18] together. You hear me? I was once was
[1:16:20] young and now I'm older.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; I can hear to TELL YOU THAT SATAN WILL
[1:16:24] EVENTUALLY PUT TOGETHER the right
[1:16:25] combination. He's just trying to get the
[1:16:27] right get you IN THE RIGHT SPOT AT the
[1:16:29] right time. PUT TOGETHER THE RIGHT
[1:16:31] COMBINATION OF TEMPTATIONS, TRIALS, AND
[1:16:33] TRAGEDIES, AND HE'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT OUT
[1:16:35] of the game.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So my direct aim has been to
[1:16:41] emphasize over and over the necessity OF
[1:16:46] BOTH THE SPIRIT BAPTISM and disciplined
[1:16:51] thoughts and plans towards God's word.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:56] Yeah,
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; I'm teaching you to refuse
[1:17:02] the false choice
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; between curtain A, just get the Holy
[1:17:09] Ghost and everything will fix itself
[1:17:12] OR CURTAIN B, JUST TRAIN YOUR MIND AND
[1:17:15] YOU'LL SOMEHOW OVERCOME.
[1:17:18] THERE IS SOME TRUTH IN BOTH OF THOSE
[1:17:20] THINGS, BUT BY THEMSELVES, THAT'S NOT
[1:17:23] THE FULL PLAN OF GOD. YOU MUST BE BORN
[1:17:26] AGAIN BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:17:28] AND THEN THAT OPENS UP YOUR CAPACITY TO
[1:17:31] BELIEVE EVERY WORD OF GOD AND TO APPLY
[1:17:34] THE TOKEN IN YOUR DAILY LIFE. LISTEN
[1:17:38] FRIENDS, THE RAPTURE IS NOT A LAYAWAY
[1:17:40] PLAN. IT'S NOT EASY, REYNOLDS. IT'S THE
[1:17:43] SAME THING THAT ENOCH HAD. AND ONE DAY
[1:17:46] YOU'RE JUST WALKING AND THE RAPTURE IS
[1:17:48] THE SHORT STEP THAT HAS YOU A LITTLE
[1:17:50] HIGHER THAN YOU WERE THE DAY BEFORE.
[1:17:53] AMEN.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW ENOCH WENT IN A RAPTURE.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; ONE DAY HE STEPPED A LITTLE HIGHER THAN
[1:18:01] HE HAD THE DAY BEFORE.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; SO IT TAKES A SPIRITFILLED EXPERIENCE in
[1:18:09] your heart.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; And a determination
[1:18:13] in your mind TO BRING YOUR UNCONVERTED
[1:18:18] FLESH SUBJECT TO every word that's
[1:18:22] balanced. That's biblical and it's
[1:18:24] desperately needed in our ranks.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE DOES NOT TELL US in vain
[1:18:34] to cast down vain imaginations.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. PAUL DID NOT TELL THE PHILIPPIAN
[1:18:40] CHURCH, YOU KNOW, HE HE WASN'T VAGUE
[1:18:44] WHEN HE SAID, "WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE
[1:18:46] TRUE, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE HONEST TO
[1:18:50] BELIEVERS, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE JUST TO
[1:18:53] BORN AGAIN PEOPLE, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE
[1:18:55] PURE, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE LOVELY,
[1:18:58] WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE OF A GOOD REPORT,
[1:19:00] IF THERE BE ANY VIRTUE, IF THERE BE ANY
[1:19:02] PRAISE, THINK ON THESE THINGS."
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:08] SOLOMON DOES NOT MINCE WORDS IN PROVERBS
[1:19:10] 4. UH BRAD, GIVE ME PROVERBS 4:23-27.
[1:19:16] Let me give YOU SOME OLD TESTAMENT
[1:19:18] GOSPEL. Is that all right?
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; SOLOMON
[1:19:23] BEING VERY CLEAR, PROVERBS 4:23
[1:19:26] through 27, KEEP THY HEART WITH ALL
[1:19:30] DILIGENCE, for out of it ARE THE ISSUES
[1:19:34] OF LIFE. PUT AWAY FROM THEE A FRO MOUTH,
[1:19:38] AND PERVERSE LIPS PUT FAR FROM THEE. LET
[1:19:41] THINE EYES LOOK RIGHT ON, AND LET THINE
[1:19:44] EYELIDS LOOK STRAIGHT BEFORE THEE.
[1:19:46] PONDER THE PATH OF THY FEET, AND LET ALL
[1:19:49] THY WAYS BE ESTABLISHED. TURN NOT TO THE
[1:19:51] RIGHT HAND, OR TO THE LEFT. REMOVE THY
[1:19:54] FOOT from evil.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; That's not a word salad.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; That's not a word play.
[1:20:04] That's that's part of the gospel of the
[1:20:06] Old Testament. I
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS.
[1:20:10] IT'S JUST AS MUCH A PART, YOU KNOW, IT'S
[1:20:13] JUST AS MUCH A PART OF ALLOWING THE MIND
[1:20:15] OF CHRIST IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AS IT is
[1:20:18] in the New Testament.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST AS MUCH A PART OF ALLOWING THE
[1:20:21] MIND WHICH WAS IN CHRIST JESUS, WHETHER
[1:20:24] IT'S IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, SOLOMON IS
[1:20:26] PREACHING IT, WHETHER IT'S IN THE NEW
[1:20:28] TESTAMENT, PAUL IS PREACHING IT. YES.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; SEE, WHETHER IT'S THE OLD TESTAMENT
[1:20:33] BRIDE OR THE NEW TESTAMENT BRIDE, SHE
[1:20:35] HAS ALWAYS NEEDED TO LET THE WORD OF GOD
[1:20:38] DWELL IN HER RICHLY.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; SEE, the Holy Spirit
[1:20:45] is aware
[1:20:48] that your human desires
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; are not always aligned with what God
[1:20:55] wants for you.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's aware of that.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; It's why
[1:21:03] the Bible says, "Lord, remember we are
[1:21:05] but dust."
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I've just had to fall on my
[1:21:08] knees and say, "Lord, just remember I'm
[1:21:10] dust. I'm so sorry. Just don't forget
[1:21:12] I'm just dust." Yes.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; he's very much aware that our human
[1:21:18] desires are not always aligned with, you
[1:21:22] see, WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
[1:21:24] THE DESIRE in your soul cuz that's for
[1:21:27] God's word when you're born again by the
[1:21:29] spirit of God.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; And that's a definite experience.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW YOUR FLESH IS STILL UNCONVERTED.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; And it's GOT TO BE BROUGHT DAILY. THAT'S
[1:21:38] THE ONE THAT HAS TO CAST DOWN VAIN
[1:21:40] IMAGINATIONS. THAT'S THE ONE THAT HAS to
[1:21:42] let the word of God dwell richly. THAT'S
[1:21:44] THE ONE WHO HAS TO CLAIM EVERY WORD AND
[1:21:46] APPLY THE TOKEN CONSTANTLY. SEE, THAT'S
[1:21:49] THE ONE WHO HAS TO TURN HIS FEET AWAY
[1:21:51] FROM EVIL. YOU KNOW, GOD UNDERSTANDS
[1:21:54] THAT SOMETIMES OUR FLESH IS NOT ALIGNED
[1:21:56] WITH WHAT HE WANTS. I MEAN, WE TALK
[1:21:58] ABOUT IT. WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.
[1:22:00] HOW OFTEN, YOU KNOW, THE THE LORD
[1:22:02] DOESN'T LET US HE DOESN'T LET US KNOW
[1:22:05] WHAT'S DOWN THE PATH. BECAUSE IF WE KNEW
[1:22:08] AHEAD OF TIME WHAT'S DOWN THE PATH, WE
[1:22:10] PROBABLY WOULDN'T GO DOWN THE PATH.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; So Jesus
[1:22:20] instructs us to become his little
[1:22:26] children
[1:22:27] willing to be led by our heavenly parent
[1:22:32] in everything. Amen.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Not just children, but little children.
[1:22:39] The ones who who will sit where the
[1:22:42] parent sits them and
[1:22:45] turn be willing to be turned any way the
[1:22:47] parent wants to turn them. Very little
[1:22:49] children don't resist. They really don't
[1:22:51] know to resist for a while. BUT BUT SEE,
[1:22:55] WE'RE NOT babes in Christ,
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; We're not baby. I MEAN, IF YOU IF YOU
[1:23:00] WERE IF YOU EVER GET AROUND A PERSON WHO
[1:23:02] COMES OUT OF THE WORLD AND THEY'RE JUST
[1:23:04] A BRAND NEW BRAND NEW SPANKING BABY BOY,
[1:23:08] brand new born again, it don't even
[1:23:11] matter. YOU COULD TELL THEM YOU HAVE TO
[1:23:13] JUMP OFF THE ROOF TO GO TO HEAVEN.
[1:23:14] THEY'D GO JUMP off the roof. THEY ARE
[1:23:17] WILLING. THEY'RE SO THEY'RE THEY'RE SO
[1:23:19] HAPPY TO BE CLEAN. THEY'RE SO HAPPY TO
[1:23:21] BE SAVED. THEY'RE JUST READY TO DO
[1:23:22] ANYTHING. THEY WANT TO BE AT CHURCH
[1:23:24] EVERY SERVICE. THEY SIT RIGHT UP ON THE
[1:23:25] FRONT ROW, YOU CAN'T PREACH IT HARD
[1:23:27] ENOUGH FOR THEM. AMEN.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; BUT WE DON'T STAY BABES IN CHRIST. WE
[1:23:31] GROW AND WE BEGIN TO REALIZE, YOU KNOW,
[1:23:33] I STILL DO HAVE A will
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; and I still do have some plans.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; We're grown adults who have to humble
[1:23:42] ourselves.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; And this is where we must get to. I just
[1:23:48] want to say this to you friends.
[1:23:50] This is really the the summation of the
[1:23:53] whole burden of on my heart tonight.
[1:23:56] come back on here and take this seventh
[1:23:58] installment on a Wednesday night. And
[1:24:00] I'm so glad it's a Wednesday night
[1:24:02] because I wanted to follow Sunday and
[1:24:04] and a lot of times Wednesdays you can
[1:24:06] just come and and there's just an
[1:24:07] atmosphere, simple faith, simple people
[1:24:10] who love God simply and they want his
[1:24:13] word.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; A lot of times you you can you can tell
[1:24:17] who your most spiritual people are
[1:24:18] because they'll be at church on
[1:24:19] Wednesdays.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:22] Amen. I'm not attacking. I'm I'm
[1:24:26] fighting against superficiality.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; I ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED YOU'RE BORN
[1:24:31] AGAIN. WHAT DO YOU WANT?
[1:24:35] I'M TELLING YOU, YOU GOT TO GROW. SEE,
[1:24:39] YOU'VE GOT TO THROW OFF THE
[1:24:40] SUPERFICIALITY. UH THAT THAT LISTEN,
[1:24:43] IT'S A PLAGUE. IT'S IN THE ATMOSPHERE.
[1:24:45] IT'S OVER THE WHOLE WORLD.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT. I
[1:24:50] WANT TO LIVE IN THOSE HEAVENLY
[1:24:51] ATMOSPHERES. I WANT TO BE ON FIRE FOR
[1:24:54] ALMIGHTY GOD. I WANT TO KNOW THAT THE
[1:24:56] POWER OF GOD AND THERE'S NO HINDRANCE
[1:24:58] THAT IT CAN FLOW THROUGH ME. I WANT TO
[1:25:00] SEE IT FLOW THROUGH YOU.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; I hope this weekend, Sunday, I, you
[1:25:08] know, every year at the beginning of a
[1:25:10] new year, I kind of give, you know, what
[1:25:13] I've traditionally called my quote
[1:25:15] unquote state of the union address. you
[1:25:18] know, where we are as a church, what is
[1:25:20] our vision, the beginning of a new year,
[1:25:23] and and some things that I'm preparing
[1:25:24] that I want to open my heart up to you
[1:25:26] as an assembly.
[1:25:29] But but this is where we must get to
[1:25:34] if WE'RE GOING TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; And do you want to
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; we're going to navigate and we're going
[1:25:42] to operate IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD AS
[1:25:45] USEFUL. I WANT TO BE a useful grown
[1:25:49] child.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; A child of God who who who has put on
[1:25:56] the armor and is ready to serve at the
[1:25:59] pleasure of the king. How many are ready
[1:26:00] to serve at the pleasure of the king? I
[1:26:04] want to tell you something friends. The
[1:26:05] Lord wants us to be wise and he wants us
[1:26:10] to be cunning and instructed and mature
[1:26:14] AND AND IN FACT, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE ARE I
[1:26:17] I JUST WILL SAY TO YOU AND THIS AND I'VE
[1:26:19] LEARNED THIS BY EXPERIENCE and I I you
[1:26:22] know, I I I I DON'T WANT TO MAKE MYSELF
[1:26:24] SOMETHING ABOVE YOU. WE'RE all in this
[1:26:26] thing together. I SAY THAT all the time.
[1:26:28] But I'm I'm HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT
[1:26:30] THAT THIS IS WHEN WE ARE THE MOST USEFUL
[1:26:33] to him. UM YOU KNOW WHEN WE CAN BE
[1:26:37] SPIRITUALLY MATURE BY HUMBLING OURSELVES
[1:26:41] AS A LITTLE CHILD.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE, BROTHER
[1:26:45] BRANDHAM SAID, THEN YOU'LL HAVE MORE
[1:26:47] POWER than the man that RUNS ALL OVER
[1:26:51] THE BUILDING AND MAKES A BIG BUNCH OF
[1:26:53] noise
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; because you have learned
[1:26:58] to conquer yourself.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; The edifying of itself
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; in love.
[1:27:08] Brother Brandham says finally in oneness
[1:27:11] 1962, here we are
[1:27:14] in the end time
[1:27:17] coming from the east and west,
[1:27:20] north and south. What are we doing?
[1:27:24] We're getting ready for a rapture.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. M getting ready for holding
[1:27:32] ourselves steady for a few minutes till
[1:27:36] every fiber is filled with the Holy
[1:27:40] Ghost. Then she'll go up.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Calling his people together to
[1:27:46] himself into in the true oneness with
[1:27:50] himself because it's his one Holy
[1:27:55] Spirit. By one spirit we are all
[1:27:59] individually baptized into one body
[1:28:01] collectively. The body of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:05] And Jesus Christ living with his spirit
[1:28:09] in our flesh is serving the church and
[1:28:14] doing the same things he did as a as an
[1:28:17] end sign to the world and that we're in
[1:28:21] the last days getting ready for rapture.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:26] So it comes down to this, friends.
[1:28:30] God's goal is to restore us back to
[1:28:33] oneness.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; God's goal is to see us living in this
[1:28:37] last day, this impossible day. What he's
[1:28:40] asked of us is quite impossible
[1:28:43] if it were not for his Holy Spirit
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; ready, willing, and able to live through
[1:28:49] you and me.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Why is this demonology? because every
[1:28:53] evil spirit is will tell you the exact
[1:28:57] opposite of what you've heard tonight
[1:28:58] and heard across these seven
[1:29:00] installments. I'm here to tell you we're
[1:29:02] pressing towards something, friend. I'm
[1:29:04] pressing toward a mark. I'm growing. I'm
[1:29:06] maturing. I'm gaining ground. I'm
[1:29:08] gaining speed.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and you say, "Oh, why
[1:29:12] aren't you satisfied? I'll be satisfied
[1:29:14] when I'm on the other side." Hallelujah.
[1:29:17] Oh, that morning when that morning
[1:29:20] breaks eternal bright and fair. OH, WHEN
[1:29:22] THE REDEEMED FRIENDS, WHAT A WHAT AN
[1:29:24] HOUR THAT IS UPON US NOW. AND IT'S IT'S
[1:29:26] it's racing to meet US AND THE WORLD
[1:29:30] FALLING OFF A CLIFF. I'M HERE TO TELL
[1:29:31] YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. I DON'T WANT TO
[1:29:32] I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO ANY OF my any
[1:29:35] of my my material in my heart for the
[1:29:37] weekend. But you you you I just want to
[1:29:40] I JUST WANT TO BRING YOU UP TO SPEED.
[1:29:42] The world is is is accelerating
[1:29:46] toward destruction.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; I mean, IT'S IT'S PICKED UP SO MUCH
[1:29:51] PACE. IT'S IT'S IT'S EXPONENTIALLY
[1:29:53] FASTER AND AND each and WITH EACH EVEN
[1:29:57] WITH EVERY 30 DAYS, IT'S JUST DOUBLING
[1:29:59] AND TRIPLING AND AND AND THE WHOLE WORLD
[1:30:02] ECONOMY IS ABOUT TO CHANGE AND SHIFT.
[1:30:04] And they're EVEN NOW EVEN EVEN FINANCIAL
[1:30:07] ADVISORS ADVISING EVERYBODY GO back to
[1:30:09] metal, go back to gold because why IT IT
[1:30:12] IT NEVER BROTHER BRANDHAM DIDN'T TEACH
[1:30:14] US that the pope controls all the ETFs.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; He controls the gold.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; And Poland and Brazil particularly are
[1:30:25] are stockpiling both of them Catholic
[1:30:28] nations.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Stockpiling gold. He controls the wealth
[1:30:32] of the world. I'll tell you something.
[1:30:34] the the you know the the enemies of the
[1:30:37] beast are learning very quickly that
[1:30:39] they can't resist him. He's got too much
[1:30:41] power already. Oh, I just say come
[1:30:44] quickly, Lord Jesus.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen friends. Whatever is left of
[1:30:49] our life here, I want to I want to be
[1:30:51] running full steam. I don't want to slow
[1:30:54] down. I don't want to miss out on
[1:30:56] opportunities. I want to be at I want to
[1:30:58] be at full throttle on that morning.
[1:31:01] Hallelujah. How about you? Amen.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand. God bless you. Now,
[1:31:05] as far as I know, that series is
[1:31:07] concluded.
[1:31:09] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:31:12] Come on, musicians. Amen. And let's uh
[1:31:14] take up some prayer requests. I only had
[1:31:17] the one I saw was uh from Brother Mark
[1:31:20] uh Carter him and Sister Tabby. Uh we're
[1:31:22] not doing so good tonight. Maybe like a
[1:31:24] setback of the flu or the cold that they
[1:31:27] had had. And that can happen. And a lot
[1:31:29] of times that's worse when that happens.
[1:31:31] you're actually more sick than you were
[1:31:33] uh prior. Amen. So, we're going to put
[1:31:35] them on the prayer request list tonight.
[1:31:37] If you have any other prayer requests,
[1:31:39] you get it to me. I didn't really get
[1:31:41] any other ones today. Um I had a request
[1:31:44] from Brother Bruce Paris to be praying
[1:31:46] for members of his family. And um and so
[1:31:50] I saw the one for brother Marcus
[1:31:52] Tabatha. And so I know that there's
[1:31:54] other ones and and we want to be praying
[1:31:56] for the saints up in North Carolina and

[1:36:27] Amen. So we have this um request for
[1:36:31] brother Mark, sister Tabitha. We have
[1:36:32] requests for brother Bruce's family,
[1:36:34] members of his family, James and
[1:36:36] different ones needing prayer. Um,
[1:36:38] brother Tony writes in, "Remember my
[1:36:40] daddy's been feeling pretty um been
[1:36:43] following um remember my daddy's been
[1:36:47] following pretty often." I think maybe
[1:36:49] he means falling. Yes, he fell again
[1:36:52] today in the doctor's office. Oh my poor
[1:36:54] brother George. Amen. Amen. Let's pray.
[1:36:57] Father, we are asking now for our dear
[1:37:00] brother George right now. Lord, such a
[1:37:03] fine brother. How we love him. Lord, in
[1:37:06] his in his aging now, his aging years
[1:37:09] falling. And Lord, I'm asking for
[1:37:11] strength for our dear brother George.
[1:37:13] I'm asking right now, Lord, mend and
[1:37:15] heal. If any there's any injury, I pray
[1:37:18] you'll mend him up quickly. Put strength
[1:37:20] in him. Lord, don't let that happen.
[1:37:21] Father, that's just a cruel enemy that
[1:37:23] would do something like that. We're
[1:37:25] praying for your servant and we're
[1:37:26] asking for your mercy. Lord, I'm
[1:37:29] reaching out for brother Bruce's family
[1:37:31] and members of his family. We were in a
[1:37:33] discussion today needing prayer. Oh God,
[1:37:36] you're still the God of the impossible.
[1:37:38] Move on the scene. I pray for those
[1:37:40] young men. I pray for brother Mark,
[1:37:42] Sister Tabitha, Lord, that you'll touch
[1:37:44] them in body. I pray, Father, for uh
[1:37:47] brother Anatoli Stell. You woke me up
[1:37:50] early this morning, Lord. Heard his name
[1:37:52] go through my mind. began praying for
[1:37:54] him, Lord, finding out, Father, that
[1:37:56] he's uh having talked to his son, that
[1:37:59] he's he's been having some problems and
[1:38:01] trouble, and you walked me up, Lord.
[1:38:03] Perhaps it was on my mind, Lord, as I
[1:38:05] went to bed, but when I woke up, I could
[1:38:07] just hear his name coming through my
[1:38:09] mind, and I'm believing that you're
[1:38:10] going to touch him, Lord God, and that
[1:38:12] you're going to strengthen him and meet
[1:38:14] the challenge. Lord, you know all about
[1:38:15] it. You know the challenges our brother
[1:38:18] Straov is facing there in Bellarus.
[1:38:20] Lord, I pray you will help him now. be
[1:38:22] near him, Father, now tonight, Lord
[1:38:24] Jesus, this word that is going forth.
[1:38:27] God, may it be so that in tomorrow and
[1:38:30] days to come, we'll continue to ponder
[1:38:32] these things. Help us now, Lord Jesus.
[1:38:35] We love you. Give us the strength that
[1:38:37] we need. We sit in this service tonight,
[1:38:39] Lord, and we heard your word, and it
[1:38:41] challenges us, Lord, how it challenges
[1:38:44] us at such a deep level. And I just want
[1:38:47] to say, Father, I want to raise up both
[1:38:48] my hands to you and say, Lord God, put
[1:38:50] strength in us all. Help us, Lord God,
[1:38:53] to raise up into higher atmospheres,
[1:38:55] meeting the challenge to be insign
[1:38:58] to a dark and dying world. May you grant
[1:39:00] it, Lord. We commit it to you in Jesus'
[1:39:04] name. Amen. Let's sing it again.
[1:39:07] Reaching out to you, dear Lord. I'm
[1:39:13] reaching out to you.
[1:39:17] I know your arm is not too short
[1:39:23] and it can reach me too.
[1:39:28] So as I pray and press my way into your
[1:39:36] kingdom true,
[1:39:39] I'll grow to be more like you. Just by
[1:39:45] reaching out to you.
[1:39:51] Amen. Praise the Lord. I don't have a
[1:39:53] microphone. We're going to need a mic to
[1:39:55] uh
[1:39:58] Anybody got a testimony? Okay, we got
[1:40:00] several. We're going to grab a
[1:40:01] microphone real quick. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:05] Amen.
[1:40:12] Okay. All right, Sister Mom, come on up
[1:40:15] here and get this.
[1:40:17] Amen. And I know, preaching, the
[1:40:19] battery's almost dead. Okay. All right.
[1:40:23] I just want to thank the Lord for last
[1:40:25] week. Y'all all prayed for me. I had two
[1:40:28] uh heart tests last week. Doctor
[1:40:30] wouldn't let me out of them. So, I went
[1:40:32] they all went very well.
[1:40:35] I have to say it was kind of rough, but
[1:40:37] I got through it for because of y'all's
[1:40:39] prayers. Another prayer y'all prayed was
[1:40:42] for my neighbor Ruth, who is just a
[1:40:45] blessing to me.
[1:40:47] on Friday, she had had uh went to the
[1:40:50] doctor and he sent her word, "Go to the
[1:40:53] ER right now." She went to the ER. She
[1:40:56] was scared. I prayed for her. She went
[1:40:58] to the ER and they kept her for two
[1:41:01] days, I believe it was. And when she was
[1:41:05] ready to come out, it was
[1:41:06] diverticulitis. She's had it before.
[1:41:09] When she was ready to come out, they
[1:41:11] thought she had COVID.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; They give her tests and she had the flu.
[1:41:17] She's my age. She's 85.
[1:41:20] She come home extremely sick. After
[1:41:24] y'all prayed for her, that was amazing.
[1:41:27] She was just almost healed perfectly.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Wow. Hallelujah.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; So, that's some prayer.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:38] Sister Melissa back there all the way
[1:41:40] back. There you go.
[1:41:43] I've been meaning to give this testimony
[1:41:44] since Christmas, but it just hasn't
[1:41:46] worked out. Um, y'all have been so
[1:41:48] faithful to um pray with me about my
[1:41:51] testing. We did extremely well. Um, so I
[1:41:54] want to thank God for that. And then
[1:41:56] over the holidays um I was um going to
[1:42:00] it was actually right before we were um
[1:42:02] going to be out for um the Christmas
[1:42:05] break. I was going to Bluff and I don't
[1:42:07] drive very often by myself, just to work
[1:42:10] and that's about it. And um I had went
[1:42:13] to merge onto 170. And I guess I just
[1:42:16] really misjudged um maybe didn't
[1:42:19] accelerate as fast as I should have, but
[1:42:21] what I thought was plenty of room was
[1:42:23] not. And how it was not a serious
[1:42:27] accident. I don't even know. But three
[1:42:30] trucks was in a two lane road. I don't
[1:42:34] know. I can't explain it. But God kept
[1:42:36] me safe and I'm so thankful. And um you
[1:42:40] know, you get in a hurry, you don't
[1:42:41] really you're not very careful
[1:42:43] sometimes. And I was had a lot to do in
[1:42:46] a short period of time. So I was on the
[1:42:47] the ladder and um it's just a step
[1:42:50] ladder, just a small ladder, but I
[1:42:52] wasn't being as careful as I should. And
[1:42:54] I missed a step, fell off and not even I
[1:42:58] mean nothing. I could have, you know,
[1:43:01] really stove myself up, but God is just
[1:43:04] faithful in the little things. And I
[1:43:06] don't want it may sound silly and but I
[1:43:08] don't want to ever let these things
[1:43:10] become
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; just common. I want him to know I
[1:43:13] appreciate all that he does.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen, sister. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; It's kind of a praise um and testimony.
[1:43:25] I just want to thank God for helping us
[1:43:27] and helping me get through everything.
[1:43:29] But I'm on the other end of the spectrum
[1:43:32] now with blood sugar and insulin and and
[1:43:34] now my numbers are dropping into the 80s
[1:43:37] and the 70s like where they're supposed
[1:43:39] to be. And um I thank God for it. I
[1:43:42] haven't taken insulin in 10 days.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Um so I just need his wisdom on on how
[1:43:49] to deal with this end of that spectrum.
[1:43:51] And I just appreciate all y'all's
[1:43:53] prayers. They mean very much to me. So
[1:43:55] thank you for praying for me. and I
[1:43:57] really genuinely appreciate.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; I just want to thank you for the prayers
[1:44:06] for Sister Pam Kronite.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Um she came through the surgery. The
[1:44:10] doctor said everything went well. She
[1:44:11] was home the next day. The worst part,
[1:44:14] she was worried because they were going
[1:44:15] through her throat um to do a spine um
[1:44:20] three and four I think and the surgery
[1:44:23] and she was worried about swallowing
[1:44:25] after and she said there's been no
[1:44:27] issues.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Wow. Praise God.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; So she's home and recovering and thanks
[1:44:30] for your prayers.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love it to know God answers
[1:44:37] prayer. Okay, brother Caleb, we give you
[1:44:39] the last word right back there.
[1:44:43] just want to thank the Lord. We were uh
[1:44:45] going home like it's been like eight
[1:44:48] weeks ago now, seven weeks, but we were
[1:44:50] coming home. The kids were not with us
[1:44:52] and we got and somebody pulled out right
[1:44:54] in front of us and um ended up totaling
[1:44:57] our car. Um but everybody was okay.
[1:45:00] Wasn't really a serious accident, but
[1:45:02] the insurance totaled it. Um I just want
[1:45:04] to thank the Lord that the kids weren't
[1:45:05] with us and that he protected us in
[1:45:07] that. And then also having to deal with
[1:45:09] the insurance company. I was just
[1:45:10] praying cuz I didn't want to have to
[1:45:13] deal with that and uh so I was just
[1:45:15] praying that everything would go smooth
[1:45:17] and it was definitely the Lord. I mean
[1:45:19] it was a five minute conversation and
[1:45:21] they were all very very helpful and it
[1:45:24] was it had to be the Lord. So I just
[1:45:26] want to thank the Lord for that Lord.
[1:45:27] Amen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn around and shake hands.
[1:45:32] Somebody say God bless you. We're going
[1:45:33] to let you be dismissed. We see you this
