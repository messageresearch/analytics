We're going to have Sister Deb give us a song. Amen. I was hoping I had my lyrics, but I don't. So just pray for me that I can remember them and just join in. This song is really important and special to me because it really is just a cry from my heart and exactly what I wish for every single day of my life. [Music] I love you for what you are doing in me. Although I am not yet what I need to be. For in my mind I often find there's too much of me. I pray you'd take it away and then you'd stay where I used to be.

But you're the one who made me out of dust. So make me one more time. And when you look at me, I want to be what you had in mind. I love you for what you are doing in me. Although I am not yet what I need to be. [Music] For in my mind I often find there's too much left of me. I pray you'd take it away and then you'd stay where I used to be. [Music] I surrender all. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. &gt;&gt; I surrender all. All to thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender. I surrender all.

That should be a fresh desire of all of our heart. Amen. That's too much feedback for me, Brother Brad. Just u keep it out there. Plenty good, but you can turn those monitors down a little bit. Amen. Turn around, shake somebody's hand, say, "God bless you." Amen. We're happy to have you in the house of God today. Amen. Sister Deb, I sure appreciated that song. That's one of my favorites that you sing. Amen. And um I think that that might be the one I wrote to her on a Monday morning. Hey, Sister Deborah, can you send me the link to that song? Where did you learn that? She said, I wish I could, Brother Jason, but I wrote it. I said, "Wow." That's when I first realized what a prolific songwriter our sister is. Amen. The devil don't have all the gifts and talents, does he? Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Appreciate um our skeleton music crew today. Amen. I think they sounded amazing. Amen. Praise the Lord. Chris even managed to stay on key. Amen. Amen. We're going to invite you to Ephesians chapter 6 this morning. Amen. Amen. Happy to see Isaac here with us and Chris. Happy to see you here with us today. It was a nice surprise. I didn't know Ake was going to be here, but got a nice text from Chris saying he was in town. So, uh, you managed to find a way, brother Luther, pick you up or how did that work? You you got here. That's the big important part. Amen. Amen. Praise God. We got a request that brother um Donald turned in. We didn't I wasn't able to get it to brother Luther quickly enough. He's asking prayer for beloved cousin Joe Waller in the hospital. I believe are his last days with us. His kidneys are failing and they're calling hospice in. Amen. The Lord is it's never too late. As long as Jesus is on the throne, it's never too late. Amen. So, we want to be praying for this need uh after we read our scripture. Just by way of announcement, we'll have our um our communion and footwashing service this Wednesday on New Year's Eve. As you know, we don't do this the kind of the traditional watch night service. We basically um it'll get out about the same time as usual in the midweek. And um and so um I I I just I go to sleep every night as a watch night. I wake up every morning, Brother Brandham says, every morning I look to see him coming. Is this the morning he might come? My So, you know, I don't we don't do that. And um nothing wrong with it at all. Many churches still do. I still get invited to preach at them sometimes and I do. And uh but we'll just be meeting at our standard time, 700 p.m. And um there will be an abbreviated um song and ministry, very abbreviated, and we'll go straight into the footwashing uh uh communion and footwashing. Amen. Praise the Lord. Just by way of announcement, have that in your mind this week, Wednesday. Amen. Ephesians chapter 6 and I'm just going to catch uh verses 12 and 13. We've been we started a little series actually back before brother Aaron was with us, brother Aaron McGary on demonology in the spiritual realm. Now when brother Brham took his series, he preached it about four different times. One of them the first time he preached it he called it demonology in the physical realm and then he preached the next night I think demonology in the religious realm and then subsequently after that at different locations once in Kentucky I think once in Indiana uh he just preached a sermon called demonology and he didn't do a lot of preaching a little bit but mainly was just uh running prayer lines so uh I'm looking at that at that area in between um because don't imagine that brother Brandham didn't talk about spiritual warfare uh in in high places where we're going to read here in Ephesians 6. So I've got a couple of quotes where brother Brandham is talking about that very thing and so we'll get to that. We're taking part two today of demonology in the spiritual realm. Ephesians chapter 6 verse 12. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world. Now, that's a significant word, the darkness. All right? You'll you'll understand why in a little bit. By the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God. You're going to hear a lot about taking all of it, the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day. So, I think that it's not a stretch to to to say that Paul is suggesting to you that unless you take the whole armor and put it on and utilize it, you're not going to be very successful standing in the evil day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. That you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand. All right? So, you're going to want to take on the whole armor of God to be able to withstand in the evil day. And and and when you take on the whole armor of God, that's when it is true of you that you have done all to stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Once you take on all the armor of God, then it's up to God to keep his word and keep you. Amen. Now, if you don't put on the whole armor of God and you don't utilize it on a daily basis, you can hardly go to God questioning why the enemy has more success in your life than you're comfortable with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know that by experience. I've questioned God. And he said, "Well, I told you to put on the whole armor." Well, I did. No, you didn't. Okay. Where didn't I? What about here? H and here. Oh, and here. Uh yeah, my fourth one was Alex, Brother Luther. Okay, Lord. Message received. Amen. Praise the Lord. We all in this together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Let's pray. Father, we have a number of families today who have reported sick, Lord, and the enemy battling them, spiritual forces in the physical realm with sickness. And Lord, we're praying. We're lifting them up in prayer. We're asking for these families, Lord, that you'd give them a touch today. There's various requests that have come in. We think of the request of this man dying in the hospital who's dear to the heart of our brother Donald. Lord, may you have mercy on the case. We commit all of these into your hands now. Lord, the the teaching and preaching of the word today. May it be effective, Lord, in our lives. We commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can be seated. I'll go ahead and have my PowerPoint put up. Amen. Demonology, the spiritual realm. This is our opening verse. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness and high places. Now I will say that in generating this image uh I was very keen to be careful uh in my in my in my prompt um to the LLM that it not uh because I was in a mixed audience of small children and I don't want to give anyone bad dreams. So, even I had to kind of um go in and do some editing myself personally using um using some of the photo photo software and and I'm comfortable with that and and I didn't want to make it too antiseptic because I don't want you to imagine that we're talking about a picnic &gt;&gt; or a trip to Disney World. This is real. And this picture is indeed an accurate depiction of the spiritual warfare. There's angels of light. There's angels of darkness. &gt;&gt; Those angels of darkness can sometimes appear as angels of light. But angels of light don't appear as angels of darkness. I'm here to tell you Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. If you're going to deal with the devil, he's all over the place. He's a liar. He in fact is he's the father of it. You cannot trust him. &gt;&gt; He his H his H his H his H his H his H his H his H his H his H his one desire is to usurp the authority of God. We've been preaching on that to take over the kingdom of God to mount the throne of God in the north and to place himself above you and I the stars of heaven. I just say not on our watch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this is spiritual warfare. Brother Brandham uh made this statement. I think I have this in my PowerPoint. I hope I do. Um see if I can get it to uh let me turn it off and turn it back on. And if this doesn't get it, we'll let you guys rotate it for us. You're going to have to do that. It's not not functioning. So, we'll let powers it at B. Worry about that. Sarah, if you'll There you go. Um no, go back to the title screen. I I was worried that I didn't get this one in there and I didn't. So, let me just read it to you. Oh, I realize now why I didn't have it in my PowerPoint. It's because that this is from the conclusion of part one that we took before we took a break with special meetings. And I read to you, Brother Brandham, from 1954 in Acts of the Holy Spirit. I tell you, Peter preached a sermon on the day of Pentecost and 3,000 souls were saved. The devil never even moved out of his bed. That's right. Oh well, let them alone. See, but he So, he's he's literally doing like Isaiah and reading the thoughts and intents of the heart. The devil just said, "Oh, just let him alone." Right? But he passed but when uh the next day see uh but he passed through the gate called beautiful the next day and healed a man crippled from his mother's womb and all hell turned loose on him. So So Satan and I was making this point last time and I'm just recapping a very short amount because I got material I want to cover. I don't want to run out of time, but we were pointing out to you last time that Satan knew full well what he was facing. And he's not a dummy. He understands the day and hour that you live in better than you think he does. And there's there's elements of God and his family that he's aware OF MECHANICALLY. HE DOESN'T QUITE GET HE DOESN'T QUITE GET HOW IT ALL FUNCTIONS. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. I THINK THAT IT MUST BAFFLE him uh that that WE'RE STILL STANDING WITH FULL FAITH AND THAT WE'RE STILL MARCHING TO ZION and that and that THE MORE HE TRIES TO harm us, the more determined we become. THE HARDER IT GETS, THE more we dig in. So, it's it's AS IF SATAN CAN'T WIN FOR LOSING. THE POOR GUY COULD PROBABLY WIN IF HE WASN'T ALWAYS LOSING. I'M GLAD HE'S LOSING AT MY HANDS. I HOPE YOU'RE GLAD HE'S LOOKING AT YOU HANDS. I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM LOSE MORE. &gt;&gt; I'd like TO SEE HIM LOSE IN OUR HOMES AND our lives and OUR CHURCH AND THIS ASSEMBLY AND OUR PERSONAL LIVES AND IN OUR HOMES AND IN OUR CHILDREN. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IT REQUIRES UH DISCIPLINE to take THE WHOLE armor of God and use it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and it's got to be used properly. So, Satan knew once he saw that man healed at the gate, beautiful, he knew right away that the acts of the Holy Ghost was now moving in the bride with the same power that he had dealt with in Jesus. And I AND I MADE A STATEMENT TO YOU LAST TIME THAT SATAN WOULD never again after that after that moment when he slept through the upper room experience. HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN COME UP short and UNDERESTIMATE THE BRIDE. HE WENT INTO OVERDRIVE AND HE IS IN OVERTIME and he IS HE IS PEDAL TO THE METAL. HE IS NOT AND AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, YOU NEED to be NOT UNAWARE OF HIS DEVICES. YOU NEED TO STUDY YOUR ENEMY. THIS IS REAL. THIS IS WAR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I SAID THAT TO YOU LAST TIME AS A CLOSING STATEMENT. THIS IS WAR. &gt;&gt; And I don't plan to lose it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know him, too. &gt;&gt; He won't never make that mistake about who we are. And I'm never, the bride is never going to make the mistake of who he is. I'm glad that God has revealed to us who he who he has been in the religious realm and we're not. Think of it today, friends. YOU SAY, UH, DON'T AND DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. DON'T JUST DON'T JUST GLOSS over the fact that YOU ARE NOT deceived by the Antichrist spirit in modern Christianity. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SAY, WHY SHOULDN'T I JUST WHY WHY IS THAT SUCH A BIG DEAL? DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOU'RE LESS THAN 1% PROBABLY AROUND the world of TWO AND A HALF ALMOST THREE BILLION PEOPLE IN CHRISTIANITY AND YOU'RE PART OF A SMALL SLIVER OF HUMANITY THAT IS NOT THE BIBLE SAYS THE WHOLE WORLD WILL WORSHIP THE BEAST NOT JUST CHRISTIANS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MUSLIMS HINDUS SIKHS JAMES ALL OF THEM THE WHOLE WORLD WILL FOLLOW AFTER THE BEAST The bride IS THE ONLY ONE, NOT EVEN THE NOT EVEN THE FOOLISH VIRGIN FULLY GET IT NOW. ONLY AFTER THE RAPTURE DO THEY COME TO THEIR SENSES AND PULL OUT OF THAT THING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, SO DON'T LET IT BE A SMALL THING IN your mind that YOU ARE A SMALL INSIGNIFICANT PART OF THIS ECONOMY UH THAT WE SEE IN THE WORLD. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, YOU'RE THE ONLY RELEVANT PART. EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING IS BASED UPON GOD'S PLAN OF REDEMPTION FOR YOU AND ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HIS BRIDE AROUND THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So this is UH THIS IS FULLON. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT EVERYTHING I JUST SAID, SATAN IS AWARE OF. HE'S full on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not deceived. Our eyes have been open. We know his plans. We know his tactics. I'm glad that we are predestinated to not fall. There's got to be an Eve. And I I made up my mind years ago that I want to be part of that second Eve that proves at the end time we're not like the first one. The the second Adam came and proved HE WAS NOT LIKE THE FIRST ONE. THERE'S GOT TO BE A a a second Eve that proves IF SHE'S ONLY ONE IN A MILLION, THAT'S ALL GOD NEEDS IS ONE IN A MILLION TO PROVE THE DEVIL IS A LIAR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO JUST AS BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD WOULD SAY, THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MAN LIKE JESUS, so Satan has never faced a bride in any age like this bride. Don't don't don't let that lo leave your mind, friends, because because you you if you if you understand this is this is the secret of real power. This is why Brother Brandham would say things like, "When the bride recognizes who she is, &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. see that she can do the greater works. That's when she's an invincible army. SO, CAN I SAY IT LIKE THIS? NOT TO ADD TO WHAT A PROPHET SAID, BUT JUST JUST LET ME PUT IT TO YOU IN SOME OF MY OWN LANGUAGE. WHEN WHEN THE BRIDE RECOGNIZES WHAT SATAN ALREADY KNOWS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Satan already knows who YOU ARE. THAT'S WHY HE'S SO DETERMINED TO TRIP YOU UP. NOW, HE CANNOT COME AGAINST YOU HEAD ON. THAT'S BEEN TRIED. THAT DOESN'T WORK. CHRIST DEFEATED HIM IN HEAVEN. THE HOLY GHOST DEFEATS HIM IN THE EARTH. NOW, HE'S NOT GOING TO COME AT YOU HEAD ON, NOT AT GOD'S FAMILY TRYING TO DISSUADE YOU FROM THE GLORIOUS TRUTH OF THIS HOUR. THAT'S NOT HIS ATTEMPT. HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO THAT AS LONG AS HE CAN OUTFLANK YOU AND GET YOU IN IN A STATE OF WEAKENED SPIRITUAL CONDITION SO THAT HE CAN COME INTO YOUR HOMES, WRECK YOUR CHILDREN, COME INTO YOUR HOMES, WRECK YOUR MARRIAGE, COME INTO YOUR HOMES, WRECK A CHURCH, WRECK MINISTRIES. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF HE IF HE IF HE CAN'T DESTROY YOU ETERNALLY FROM THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. IF HE CAN JUST STOP YOU FROM DISPOSSESSING HIM AT THE END TIME, HE STILL HAS A CHANCE IN HIS OWN MIND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THIS IS WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM, you know, WOULD WOULD MAKE THIS SO CLEAR THAT THAT THE BRIDE IS, YOU KNOW, SHE'S NOT JUST STANDING. WHEN HE saw the vision of the of the preview of the bride, she wasn't standing. She was marching. now. And and and NOT ONLY IS SHE MARCHING, she's ascending &gt;&gt; already. ALREADY SHE'S ASCENDING. BUT YOU KNOW, BEFORE WE GO OFF WORLD IN THE RAPTURE, um you know, or at least a faster dimension, however you want to say it, uh to meet the Lord in the air. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN A BATTLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And I'm in it to win it. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, ON A DAILY BASIS, &gt;&gt; I KNOW I'LL WIN ULTIMATELY, BUT I WANT TO WIN TODAY AND TOMORROW AND THE NEXT DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, I WANT THAT WHEN I WHEN I CROSS THE LINE ON THAT FINAL MORNING, AND I GOT SOME MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT SHORTLY. BUT I I WANT TO BE I WANT TO BE AT FULL PRESS, FULL STEAM. I WANT TO BE WIDE OPEN. I WANT TO BE TRAMPLING EVIL SPIRITS AND PUTTING THEM UNDER MY FEET WHERE THEY BELONG. I DON'T WANT GOD TO BE A A A COAST GUARD RESCUE CHOPPER TO BARELY GET ME INTO THE RAPTURE. OH NO, FRIENDS. I WANT TO HEAR THE TRUMPET SOUND. I WANT TO BE GATHERED WITH THE SAINTS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. So this IS WHAT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD RUN into constantly in demonology in the religious realm. All right. Oh yeah, you're running that for me, sister Sarah. So, let's go to my first slide. So, Brother Brand, I READ THIS. I QUOTED THIS FOR YOU AND I WANTED TO put it up because this is where Brother Brandham, this was what he dealt with so much in the in the realms of demonology in the religious realm. As people today are trying to say we should wash feet once a year on Thursday and on Friday, we should take the communion and all different doctrines. They argue about whether it should be this day or that day or whether it should be a Sabbath day or the first day of the week. All these things are just merely tradition. Now hold right there, Sarah. They're all just merely tradition. Okay. All right. Now advance. WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO any of it? It what good would it would any of it do you whether you had Lent? That's a Catholic thing. Lent, whether you had lent or not LENT IF THERE WAS NO LIFE IN YOU. IT'S ONLY A MEMORIAL, WHICH THERE'S NOTHING AGAINST IT, BUT THEY HAVE CERTAINLY CARRIED OUT THEIR TRADITIONS. BUT NOTICE WHAT I HAVE UNDERLINED. THEY'VE LEFT OFF THE main thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; NOW, I'M I'M GOING TO GO AGAIN AND I'M GOING TO I'M GOING TO ADD TO THIS STATEMENT. SO, YOU KNOW, THEY ARGUE OVER WHICH MESSAGE CHURCH WE SHOULD GO TO OR WHICH MESSAGE PASTOR IS THE BEST ONE. WE ARGUE ABOUT WHO KNOWS THE QUOTES THE BEST OR WHAT ABOUT THIS DOCTRINE OR WHAT ABOUT THAT DOCTRINE. IT'S ALL FINE. WE'VE GOT CHURCHES AROUND THE WORLD AND WE'VE GOT GREAT MEN OF GOD WHEREVER GOD HAS PLACED YOU. BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD ANY OF IT DO YOU WHETHER YOU HAD WENT TO THIS MESSAGE CHURCH OR ANOTHER MESSAGE CHURCH IF THE LIFE IS NOT IN YOU? &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE, you've left off &gt;&gt; the main thing. All right. SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM DOESN'T NEGLECT, AS I SAID, BY ANY means the over the overarching battles that we face from demonology in the spiritual realm. Uh, and here's one that he's actually um, you know, taking it down to the very plain things of everyday life and and the overcoming power that ought to be in the Holy Ghost. All right, Sarah. Next slide. People today SEEM TO BE SO comfortable in sin BECAUSE WE OWN A NEW CAR, because we can eat three meals a day, sleep on a clean bed. THAT'S WONDERFUL, BUT THAT WOULD BE GOOD. BUT WE FORGET GOD WHEN PROSPERITY comes like that. And here it is. We've left off the main thing. Judgment, righteousness. Here's a main thing. Power of the HOLY GHOST. RESURRECTION, ETERNAL JUDGMENT. I WANT TO BE ABLE I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER A THOUSAND-YEAR MILLENNIUM AND FINALLY I'M QUALIFIED UH TO JUDGE THE THINGS OF GOD. I'D LIKE TO BE AN ABLE-BODIED JUDGE OF GOD'S WORD RIGHT NOW. HOW I SHOULD LIVE, HOW WE SHOULD CONDUCT OURSELVES AND TO SEE THE ENEMY AND HIS TACTICS AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO DEFEAT HIM. I PROMISE YOU, YOU CAN DEFEAT HIM EVERY SINGLE TIME IF YOU TAKE GOD'S WORD. &gt;&gt; And he will defeat you every single time if you don't because WITHOUT GOD'S WORD, YOU'RE NO MATCH FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO SO THE DAY OF THE RESURRECTION, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO SAY THIS AND ALL RIGHT, SARAH, let's see. Just hold right there, sister until I and I'll give you the next one in a second. So, I WANT TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT TO YOU AND I AND I THOUGHT, WELL, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY prove this because it's a little bit of a an astonishing statement. At least it was to me as I thought about it. Resurrection morning. Now, I'm going to prove this, so don't throw something at me. Resurrection morning, THE DAY OF THE RESURRECTION. Are you looking forward to that? &gt;&gt; THAT DAY WILL BE A DAY VERY LITTLE different if any at all from every day that we live now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know what your I know the world is looking for a a some kind of a a a Trump style. You know, here comes Christ down the escalator, down the golden escalator. A angel steps out on a cloud, blows a horn, the whole world hears it, and here comes a golden escalator down, and then Jesus comes down to take everybody home in the rapture. As far as the world is concerned, everybody's going to heaven, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I don't even know what what they think hell's just going to be vacated, you know. Uh, you know, so I don't I don't get that kind of thinking. But, you know, when you tell people, you can tell somebody a lie, you tell them what they want to believe, they'll believe that. So people want so desperately to believe they can live any old way and that being a Christian doesn't really mean you have to make any effective changes. And when preachers come along and tell them that's okay, then they go, "Oh, well, okay, good." &gt;&gt; See, and we're talking about two and a half billion nearly that have that attitude. The ones that don't are holiness, foolish virgin, and the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; See, SO IT WILL BE A DAY VERY LITTLE DIFFERENT. I don't even know based on the quotes I'm about to read. I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF I CAN EVEN indicate to you that it'll be in any way different THAN YOUR EVERYDAY WAKING UP MAKING THE coffee life getting your day getting your day going. the resurrected saints AND OUR BODY CHANGE. When that happens, and this is a this is important, THAT WILL BE OR IT SHOULD be and I believe will be for those who are really ready for it. IT WILL JUST BE A NEXT LITTLE short step &gt;&gt; to a life of overcoming victory and resurrection power you've already been living and demonstrating the day before. &gt;&gt; All right. Let's prove it. Look why them men who had walked with Christ, disciples that walked with him. When you see those three dots, that's me editing out portions. You can go back and get the whole quote. I'm just getting the relative relevant stuff and I'm keeping the flow. Don't don't ever worry about that. LOOK WHY THEM MEN who had walked with Christ, DISCIPLES THAT WALKED WITH HIM, WHY DOES THE SCRIPTURE SAY THAT ELIAS must come first come before these things and restore all things? Jesus said, "He's already come and you didn't know it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you next? Next one. Are you ready? I WANT TO SHOCK you a little bit. The rapture will be the same way. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'LL BE SO SIMPLE. NO DOUBT. IT'LL BE LIKE LIKEWISE TILL THE RAPTURE WILL COME ONE OF THESE days and nobody will know nothing about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Next. THE RAPTURE WILL COME IN SUCH A SIMPLE WAY till the judgments will fall and they'll see the son of man and they'll say, "Wasn't we supposed to have such and such and wasn't there supposed TO BE ELIAS SENT TO US? And wasn't there supposed to be a rapture next?" Jesus will say, "It's already happened and you didn't know it." God in simplicity. See, now notice the rapture will be so few go in that bride. It'll be Now, just let me signal you, Sarah, because I want to do this deliberatively and slowly. It'll be maybe one leave Jeffersonville, just somebody come up missing. Now, what you're about to see is brother Brandon's going to go city, state, you'd go nation. No, city, state, continent. &gt;&gt; And in a short sentence, now I want to say something before we go to our next slide. I'm very glad this is in the seals. Later in questions and answers on the seals, they asked Brother Brandham, Brother Bram, you said one there that and he's going to he's about to say maybe 500 around the world. You said 500 is only going to go in the rapture. And brother Brandon makes it clear. He's just using a for instance. He He's not saying there would be one out of Jeffersonville or one out of Georgia or one out of Africa and 500 total. He's just simply saying he wants you to think ABOUT THIS. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S WHAT HE'S WHAT I'M DOING TODAY. I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO REALIZE IT'S NOT SOME EARTHSHATTERING EVENT. IT'S GOING TO BE A DAY. IT'S GOING TO BE A MORNING LIKE YOU HAVE EVERY MORNING. AND YOU'RE GOING TO STEP INTO A NEW BODY CHANGE. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN LIVING A DAILY LIFE OF PUTTING ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD, IT WON'T BE MUCH FOR YOU TO PUT ON A NEW BODY. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; All right, SARAH. THEY'LL SAY, "WELL, YOU NEVER THE REST OF THEM WON'T KNOW. THERE'LL BE ONE LEAVE GEORGIA. There'll be one leave in Africa. And and let's LET'S SAY THERE WOULD BE 500." SEE, IT'S just he's just using as an example. LET'S SAY THERE, LISTEN, THERE WAS EIGHT IN THE days of Noah. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS ONE in the days of Enoch in the whole earth. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; LET'S SAY THERE WOULD BE 500 PEOPLE. Brother Jason, why are you doing it? You're drilling holes in us. Why? Because I want to get it across to you how important it is that you apply spiritual warfare and putting on the whole armor of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm trying to unsettle you because I don't want you JUST TO GLOSS IT OVER AND TO SAY, "OH, I JUST COME TO A MESSAGE CHURCH AND I BELIEVE GOD SENT A PROPHET. I'M A CHRISTIAN AND I LOVE JESUS." I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ALL THAT'S GOOD. ALL THAT'S WONDERFUL. THAT'S A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT WHO JUST HOLD THAT AS A TRADITION. BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE LIFE, WHAT GOOD DOES ANY OF IT DO YOU? MY &gt;&gt; SO HE SAYS ONE LEAVE GEORGIA THERE BE ONE LEAVE AFRICA AND LET'S SAY THERE WOULD BE 500 PEOPLE living will go in the translation that ain't the church this is THE BRIDE THE BRIDE HE'S TALKING about next the church WILL COME UP BY THE THOUSANDS BUT THAT'S IN THE NEXT resurrection that's after the millennium see they THEY THEY LIVE NOT FOR THE SPACE OF A THOUSAND YEARS. BUT IN THE BRIDE, IF 500 PEOPLE LEFT THE earth this very minute, the world would know nothing about it. Jesus said there'd be one in the bed and I'll take one and I'll leave one now. Next, that's at night time. See, THEN THEN uh they would BE TWO IN THE FIELD. SEE, OVER on the other side OF THE EARTH, ON THIS SIDE OF THE EARTH, people are sleeping. On this side of the earth, they're working. SO, THE POINT HE'S MAKING IS IT'S GLOBAL. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL GOING TO HAPPEN ONE OF THESE MORNINGS. IT'S ALL GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S ALL GOING TO GO FORWARD. I DON'T KNOW IF IT IF IT'S GOING TO FOLLOW THE SUN AROUND, YOU KNOW, OR OR OR AS THE EARTH ROTATES AND THE SUNLIGHT UH COMES AROUND THE EARTH AND AND MAYBE IT'LL FOLLOW THE TIME ZONES. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T CARE. I JUST WANT TO BE THERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, HE SAYS, let me catch up to MYSELF HERE. THAT'S AT NIGHT TIME. They would be two in THE FIELD OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EARTH. I'LL TAKE ONE and leave one. As it was in the days OF NOAH, SO SHALL IT BE IN THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN. NEXT. THINK. Everything will move just as common as it can be. So you think I'm out on a limb by saying it'll be just like the morning before. It'll be a secret BECAUSE HE SAID HE'D COME LIKE A thief in the night. Next slide. He that is in you. THIS IS SIX MONTHS LATER or about uh eight months later. THE RAPTURE WILL BE SO SUDDEN AND SO QUICK THAT THE world will never even miss them that they're gone. THEY'LL KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. HE COMES AND SLIPS her way. IT'LL BE GONE. THEY'LL KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. SO YOU CAN SEE WHY WHEN the scripture says WE WRESTLE NOT NOW CATCH THIS LANGUAGE WE WRESTLE NOT AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD BUT AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES. SO SO I CAN SO THE THE LANGUAGE OF THE BIBLE IS SAYING WE DO WRESTLE WE JUST DON'T WRESTLE AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD BUT WE DO WRESTLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S NOT, OH, WE DON'T WE DON'T WRESTLE AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD. LET'S GO ON VACATION. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU DO WRESTLE AGAINST AND IT'S WORSE. YOU YOU'LL WISH THAT YOU ONLY HAD TO WRESTLE AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD. FLESH AND BLOOD ARE WHAT NATIONS DO. AND YOU CAN IF YOU'VE GOT BIGGER SUPER WEAPONS THAN THEY'VE GOT, YOU CAN KILL MORE OF THEM THAN THEY CAN KILL OF YOU. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOUR SUPER WEAPONS DON'T WORK ON. THE ONLY WEAPON IS THIS ONE. AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN EMPLOY ITS POWER IS YOU. IT HAS TO BE A LIVING REVELATION TO YOU BECAUSE SATAN DON'T CARE HOW RELIGIOUS YOU ARE OR EVEN HOW RIGHT YOU ARE IN YOUR MENTAL UNDERSTANDING of the word and can argue it. He knows if you don't have the life, you won't come up anyway. See, DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY WE EMPHASIZE TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE IN THE HOLY GHOST THE SAME AS I HAVE, THE SAME AS YOUR PARENTS HAVE, SAME AS YOUR GRANDPARENTS HAVE. IT'S IT'S THE TOKEN ON DISPLAY OR NOTHING. THERE'S NO SECOND PLACE. SECOND PLACE WAITS A THOUSAND YEARS. &gt;&gt; YES, that's right. &gt;&gt; I DON'T INTEND TO COME IN SECOND PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO WE WRESTLE NOT BUT BUT WE DO WRESTLE AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES. SO OUR THAT'S WHY OUR 13TH VERSE SAID WHEREFORE TAKE UNTO YOU THE WHOLE THE ALL of thee THE ENTIRE armor of God that you may BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND IN the evil day AND HAVE DONE ALL TO STAND. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. So it THEN IT BECOMES A QUESTION. I think you can take that. That my last slide, Sarah? I think. Go to the next one. Okay, go back. Oh, I didn't I didn't I realize now I didn't finish reading the quote. Okay, let me let me go back. Yes, I realize I don't have it here. I have it there. I'm read this again. And the rapture will be so sudden, so quick that the world will never even miss them. That they're gone, right? They'll know nothing about it. He comes and slips her away. It'll be gone. They'll know nothing about it next. maybe in this great day of prosperity. Uh, that seems out of sync for me and I don't not sure why that's out of sync. Um, but it's it's okay. I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and and read it now because I've got a lengthy one that's not on the screen. Let's read this. Maybe in this great day of prosperity. Oh, I see. Now, this is spiritual warfare. That we've been so interested in prosperity till we've left off the main thing. Here was another one of my main thing quotes. Maybe we have gone off on some kind of a tantrum without him. Next. Okay. So, SO IT'S ALL ABOUT not leaving off the main thing. Say, I'm a believer. Okay. But that's not the main thing. Well, but I come to church, but that's not even the main thing. And some don't even do the not main thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I I I pray and read my Bible. Well, that's a big thing, but that's still not the main thing. &gt;&gt; The main thing is you must be born again. Do you know him in his power and conjunction his resurrection? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know him in his power and in his resurrection? SEE, SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT FROM THAT KIND OF PERSPECTIVE, IT BEGS THE QUESTION, what would Satan do? How might Satan most effectively prevent us today today from accomplishing the instructions that we read in that 13th verse? Put on the whole armor of God. See, um I did I did some some some research um because and I and it was a narrow focus from I just I just decided to keep it from the writings and the sermons and the commentaries from the ministries uh that were connected to the restoration of the bride starting with Luther and coming forward specifically Luther Wesley the early Isuza uh fathers and all the way to through to brother Brham all the way through to uh the dispensational angel that uh that with Paul ends up bookending the ages. I hope you understand that's what William Brham was dispensational messenger. It wasn't just a prophet like under the Old Testament. Had that been true, God would have let him go live in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; But in standing in the gap, he forbid him to do that. He said, "You're you've got a different kind of a ministry." So he's a he's like Paul. He's a dispensational God bookends the ages with dispensational angels. &gt;&gt; All right? He did the same thing when he closed out the Old Testament. He sent John and then Jesus comes on the scene and Jesus is the keystone that joins the old and new together. John closed it out. You follow that? &gt;&gt; All right. So, so now I would I would like to say that besides uh Luther Wesley, the Isuza fathers and brother Brandham, I included um Smith Wigglesworth because he was lived on the outer edge of those early ministries from the not only the Welsh revival but the Isuza revival. The Welsh revival was just across the pond about a year or two before the Isuza revival. So, it was coming this way. I also chose to include Arthur Pink because Brother Brandham, he's a reformed minister. Brother Brandham uh studied his works and quoted from him numerous times. He's one of my personal favorites as well. And um and I I wanted to look at just to see if we could determine how would the enemy best what would be his best tactic. And I and I have to delve back into their writings to see h what how they felt about these verses. All right. Right. And I I'm just just an overview. If you go back, I have all of their writings. It wasn't hard for me. I have all of their books and their commentaries. I study from them all the time. And so, uh, it was a it was a quick, uh, pitch and catch for me. Um, but you're welcome to go back and study it out yourself. But, but when we when we when you think about the armor, you've got to understand this is a this is an important principle. The armor is very comprehensive. It's not just it's not just something light and transient. It's uh because because first of all it's comprehensive because it guards not only our hearts but it guards our mind. It not only guards our hearts and our minds but it guards our daily lives. See &gt;&gt; it guards our actual actions. That make sense to you? SO WHEN WE UNDERSTAND it then the these verses certainly right off the bat UM IF THEY IMPLY ANYTHING AT all and this was from a commentator and I don't remember which one I don't have it noted in in here but he made the comment that right off the bat if if if Ephesians 6:12 and 13 is saying anything to us at all IT IS CERTAINLY IMPLYING that we need to be fully equipped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At all times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is this is what you're about to hear. I'm going to read some excerpts from these great great ministries of the restoration of the brat tree starting with Luther. You're going to hear this this undergirling this overarching theme that they're all in agreement that we need to be fully equipped at all times. Take unto you the whole armor of God. SO ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT WAYS that they point to would be distraction. NOW I'VE TALKED I'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT FOR YEARS. DISTRACTION or busyiness of life and Satan uses that to do YOU SAY YOU SAY OH YOU KNOW BROTHER JASON YOU KNOW UH CAN IT CAN IT REALLY BE THAT SIMPLE uh it can and IT IS AND IN FACT IS IT'S AT THE VERY FOUNDATION OF EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S BUILT ON TOP OF IT DON'T GET DISTRACTED AWAY FROM YOUR PRAYER LIFE AWAY FROM YOUR CHURCH ATTENDANCE AWAY FROM READING YOUR BIBLE AWAY FROM LISTENING TO tapes Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. When I was working, EARBUDS AND A DEVICE STAY OR THEY WERE WIRED, BUT I WORKED I I MY WHOLE LIFE GROWING UP ON A JOB. I CONSTANTLY WENT FROM ONE MESSAGE TO ANOTHER MESSAGE TO ANOTHER MESSAGE TO ANOTHER MESSAGE. AND I AND I AND I PROBABLY IN MY LIFETIME LISTEN TO SEVERAL TIMES OVER WHAT THE REST OF YOU HAVE. YOU SAY, "YEAH, BUT YOU'RE A PREACHER AND A PASTOR." WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW I WOULD BE WHEN I STARTED DOING THAT. I JUST HAD AN INSATIABLE URGE. I WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT GOD. I WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT HIS WORD. AND I RECOMMEND TO YOUNG PEOPLE, OLDER PEOPLE, MARRIED PEOPLE, SINGLE PEOPLE, GET IN THOSE TAPES, PLAY THEM. WHEN YOU FINISH IT, START IT AGAIN. PLAY ANOTHER ONE. STAY IN YOUR BIBLE. STAY READING THE STAY READING GOD'S WORD AND HEARING GOD'S PROPHET. SO NATURALLY IT WOULD BE DISTRACTION AND BUSYINESS BECAUSE HE can attempt, YOU KNOW, TO MAKE US FOCUS ON ON ON OUR WORLDLY CONCERNS and and distractions. AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE THEM. THEY'RE LEGIT. &gt;&gt; NOT SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE DISTRACTIONS. WORLDLY CONCERNS, THAT IS A LEGITIMATE CONCERN. WE DO HAVE TO LIVE HERE. I CAN'T BE SO HEAVENLY MINDED THAT I'M NO EARTHLY GOOD. I'M NOT LIVING IN A COMMUNE. &gt;&gt; I'M ON THE STREETS WITH YOU. THIS IS WAR, AND I DON'T PLAN TO LOSE IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO ANOTHER ONE THAT HE WOULD COME WITH, AND I I REMEMBER YEARS AGO, I WROTE A A SMALL essay on THIS, AND I'M KIND OF BORROWED FROM IT, UH NOT IN A great degree, BUT IT IT'S ALWAYS STOOD OUT TO ME that Satan will use discouragement and self-doubt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I REMEMBER ONE OF THE TIMES, I THINK IT WAS EVEN BEFORE I WAS A PREACHER, MAYBE I WAS ALREADY PREACHING AT THE TIME, I WENT OVER TO MY MOM'S HOUSE AND JUST TO SIT AROUND AND visit with the dogs and GET A COFFEE. NOT MY MOM WAS tell me she had dogs and and they were they were my dogs and so I went back so I must have been married at the time and so I went back to I'm sorry sister Jean had dogs that had been my dogs and I went to see the dogs and my mom and drink coffee. Okay, we got that clear. Amen. I don't want to see any edited videos. Brother Jason saying went to see his mother who was a dog. But I remember, you know, I CAUGHT HER AT A TIME AND AND I COULD TELL SOMETHING WAS weighing in and weighing down on her heart and the Lord just LIT MY HEART UP AND I JUST STARTED PREACHING a sermon about how discouragement is one of the devil's greatest tools. It is extremely effective. You know, if he IF HE CAN'T DISCOURAGE YOU WITH TOO MANY BILLS OR THIS FRIEND SAID THIS ABOUT YOU OR THIS DISEASE OR SICKNESS YOU CAN'T GET RID OF OR THIS SPIRITUAL WEAKNESS THAT THE DEVIL KEEPS STUMBLING YOU AT AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THE SKY IS FALLING. YOU'RE NOT WORTHY. YOU'RE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE HOLY GHOST AND THE THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST YOU WANT TO RUN INTO A CORNER. YOU WANT TO QUIT CHURCH. YOU WANT TO GET AWAY FROM PEOPLE. THAT'S THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. YOU'RE THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. CHRIST DIED FOR YOU. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. THE SEALS ARE OPEN. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. THE COMING OF THE LORD IS SOON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I have to believe that what he said in the word. If I if I do stumble, IF I CONFESS MY SINS, I SAID THIS TO YOU RECENTLY, MY FAITH IS IN THE WORD THAT IF I CONFESS MY SINS, HE'S FAITHFUL AND JUST TO forgive me and to cleanse me of all unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; Satan will use temptation uh and I don't mean I DON'T MEAN AS MUCH, YOU KNOW, temptation of worldly women or worldly music or this or that or the other, but but and and I'm not even TALKING ABOUT THERE'S THERE'S I'M only hitting a few. There's temptation to riches and wealth and all of that. Not even dealing with that today. Here's a here's a biggie. Here's an important one. Temptation to compromise. That means I'm going to stay a believer, but I'm just not going to be that fervent. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm still going to be a believer and I'm still going to believe what God did in our day. And if anybody asks me, I'm going to declare. I'm not going to I'm not going to uh I'm not going to I'm not ashamed of the gospel. It is the power of God to salvation. I know it. I get it. I'll tell anybody what God has done for me. But in my daily walkound, living, breathing, talking, walking life, I'm going to accept compromise on my standards of how I serve God and my spirituality. And and and the enemy, if he's trying to do anything to disarm you of your armor, it's get you. When he can do that, then he's going to get you to compromise. That's right. &gt;&gt; The temptation to compromise. This third tactic, I would just say this. It's almost always the byproduct of of of falling or failing in the application of the first two, which were falling victim to distraction or falling victim to discouragement. And then uh from there, it's just a slippery slope for him to get you to uh be tempted and to compromise. But we are encouraged. See, I want to encourage you today, and I'm going to do it in a weird way. I want to encourage you with a something that sounds negative. Stop listening to dark forces. &gt;&gt; Because that's what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Say, I I wasn't having a conversation with dark forces like you like I saw in that picture. When you're being tempted and it's working, you're being tempted to compromise. You can't stop a bird from flying over your head, but you don't have to let him build a nest there. &gt;&gt; When you do not bring every thought subject to the word of God and let the Holy Ghost kill it, but you would look at it and view it and entertain by it, I'm here to tell you something. You are in direct communication with dark dark angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be naive. &gt;&gt; Don't think that's a fairy tale. It's real. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; don't think these dark beings aren't real. Brother Brandham saw them. And and in fact, as he not only saw them, he heard them. And brother Brandham, that's why I said to you in in our beginning, it says powers of darkness because brother Brandham, interestingly, when he would see them, they always were dark. &gt;&gt; He would say, "See that dark shadow? See that dark streak?" He said, "I see a I see the man. going to see the woman's shadowed. A dark shadow, a dark hood is over them. See, these are dark forces. Brother Brandham not only saw them, he heard them scream to one another. I just heard him in a prayer line in demonology yesterday, one of those four that he preached on it. And he's talking right in the middle of talking to a woman. And he says, "Just a moment." And there's a long pause and you don't know what's happening. And all of a sudden, you he says, "I hear a demon screaming." &gt;&gt; And he says, "Oh, I see what it is." He says, "Here it is he said, "You lady, you've got this problem." He says, "Well, guess what? The woman right here also has it. And those demons are screaming back now. You're both healed. Go home and give God glory." See, so these things are real. He saw them. He heard them. He was confronted by them. And uh and was often uh confronted by them. Uh Brother Brandham says, and I and I've got a I've got a a little bit of a lengthy quote I want to read. You still good? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm coming down. Um, I'm coming down. It's all It's all good. Don't worry. Not going to hold you long. This is an important topic. Brother Brandham comes to the absolute and he relates a story. He starts out by telling about when brother Carlson and all them and they and the angel come and said, "They've got a trap set for you." Remember that one? &gt;&gt; And brother B said, "Well, I won't go." And the angel said, "No, you go. I'll be with you." And so he said, "You go tell them they're not going to get that place that it's going to." And they said, 'Well, Brother Brandon, we've already paid a deposit. We've already got it reserved. We've already given them money. He said, 'I don't care what you've done on the day of the event. You're not going to get it. I don't know why you're just not going to get it. What are we going to get? I don't know. It's going to be a green room, and there's going to be tables this way, and Dr. This one will sit here and Dr. So and so, and there'll be this one, and you'll sit here and I'll be here, and then there'll be and and he literally describes the whole thing. And and he says, "You're not going to get it. We're going into this green room, and Dr. Me is going to sit down here." And so and just exactly they'll be sitting. I don't want to try to pull any punches. Just introduce me to the audience and let me do the rest. I love that. He says, "And that morning when he come up there, every man sitting just exactly. They cancelled the place out. They had to get the town and country to get a place and there there there's exactly what I described. Just exactly there set Dr. Meat and all the rest of them just the place that that they he had said they would be." And I looked over at him and brother Tommy Hicks looked at me and he said, "Brother Brandham, I feel like fainting." And he said, I said, "Don't worry." And so, Brother Carlson got up and said, "Now, I know a lot of you men is going to disagree with Brother Brandham and things like that, but said there's one thing. He's not afraid to stand here." Said, "Now, I'll just turn it over to him." And I said, "Now, each one of you, now listen to this religious demons. This is relig demonology that Brother Brandon was facing in this in the religious realm. And I said, 'n now each one of you, here is what you got against me. And I called over four or five different things. I want some man to take his Bible and come here, stand by my side, and disprove it. Certainly. And if you can't do it, then stay off my back. That's right. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Uh-huh. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he said, I haven't even got a high school education. And every one of you introduced yourself as Dr. this and theology and this, that, and the other. And he said, I don't have a high school education. He said, but I challenge you to bring your Bible and disprove even one of the things. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, friends, this wasn't done in a corner. You don't have to hide and be ashamed. God proved this around the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and brother Carlson said, "He he is standing." And so and so, Brother Brandham said, "That's right." Said, "Then get off my back." That's right. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Uhhuh. That's right. Brother Brandham says, "He is standing there with you." And so what difference does it make? So now then he goes on and you remember, and I'm not going to tell the story. Do you remember about he's walking and he sees the great mamba the big the big black snake you remember that he's jumping at his brother and brother Brandham is brother Brandham is told you've been getting you've been given power to bind him and loose him so brother Brandham breaks in now he says he said you've been given power to bind him said be of good cheer isn't that a isn't that amazing THING FRIENDS THE ENEMY COMES INTO YOUR HOME AND A PROPHET IS SAYING BE OF GOOD cheer &gt;&gt; how can I be of good cheer because you've BEEN GIVEN POWER TO BIND HIM OH HE'S IN A CHURCH HE'S GOT MY HOME HE'S GOT MY TEENAGE MAJOR, BE OF GOOD CHEER. YOU'VE GOT POWER TO BIND HIM. &gt;&gt; OH, I GOT THIS PROBLEM IN THE WORLD AND THIS PROBLEM ON MY JOB AND THIS PROBLEM IN MY FINANCES. BE OF GOOD CHEER. LIFT UP YOUR HEAD. YOUR REDEMPTION DRAWETH NIGH. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT POWER TO BIND HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I SPOKE TO HIM AND HIS TAIL WENT UP IN THE AIR AND WHIRLED AROUND. AND JUST LIKE IN THIS PICTURE, HANDLE CHOKED HIMSELF TO DEATH. BLUE SMOKE FLEW OUT OF HIM. NOW, now watch him. He comes to this story. Now, here's what he's been trying to get to. Next morning, when I woke up, I was laying there. And I said, "I better get up and take the children to school." I looked over and there was this hideous looking thing. Looked like it was Alioop. You remember the old comic strip? Alioop. He looked like a caveman with big horns. I remember seeing that as a child. Looked like Alioop in the funny paper. Great big horns sticking out of it. He was going sounding like a hen cackling or singing like they're going from the barn. I looked at it. I said, "Mey, ma, ma, honey." She didn't wake up. I thought, "Yeah, that's scared to death." I waited there just a minute and stand and watch. People talk about devils and don't even know what they are sometime. That's right. But you run headlong into them every day. Maybe you will. And after a while, he was accusing me. Said, "You have no power with God. You're just a bluff. You have no power." Now, Brother Brandham had just the day before seen the vision of the man and had been told, "You have power to loose and bind." And so now here's the enemy. Don't think that just because God comes and does something special in your life, the devil won't come the next day. Even if you're a prophet. See, imagine how Brother Brandham would have withstood this if he hadn't had on all the armor. And he says after a while, he was accusing me. He said, "You have no power with God. You're just a bluff. You have no power." power. See, the the enemy knew that wasn't true, but if he could get brother Brandham to believe it about himself, and I said, "Satan, you're an offense to me. Get out of my way in the name of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he left. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I laid there a little bit in bed, started to raise up. I felt a real sweet feeling come over me. I thought, "Wonder if the Holy Spirit now is close." And over in the corner, so help me. Here's my Bible over my heart. Brother Bram said, right where that demon had been in the corner and vanished, he said a light dropped down into that same corner. And he and he said, "The sweetest voice I ever heard in my life said, don't fear to go anywhere and don't fear to do anything for the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That settled it with me. Let them rage. I got an absolute. My anchor holds yonder because it's the word of the living God. So they're very real. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THESE DEMON FORCES ARE VERY REAL. AND JUST AS YOU KNOW, JU JUST AS THE SCRIPTURE uh shows US THAT IT'S POWERS OF DARKNESS, THIS IS EXACTLY HOW THEY APPEAR TO A PROPHET. Listen friends, when you don't I'm I'm I'm I'm in my winding up stage and I got a a a short YouTube video I want to show you. When you WHEN YOU DON'T PUT ON THE WHOLE armor of God, um then then THIS IS WHERE THEN THIS IS WHERE THE ENEMY BECOMES FAR TOO SUCCESSFUL IN OUR LIVES OF GETTING US TO COMPROMISE, OF GETTING US TO COOL OFF, OF GETTING US TO PRIORITIZE OTHER THINGS ABOVE ASSEMBLING YOURSELVES TOGETHER. THE MORE so as you see the day approaching. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN SO COMPROMISED THEY DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT THAT SCRIPTURE ANYMORE. THAT SCRIPTURE MEANS NOTHING TO TOO MANY BELIEVERS. IT MIGHT AS WELL NOT EVEN BE IN THEIR BIBLE BECAUSE THEY PUT JOBS AND CAREERS AND BOYFRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS AND AND THIS EVENT AND THIS EVENT AND THAT EVENT AND THIS GATHERING AND THIS SOCIAL THING AND THEY CARE NOTHING ABOUT THAT. PAUL SAID THE MORE THE DAY GETS EVIL, THE MORE YOU NEED TO ASSEMBLE YOURSELVES TOGETHER IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. AND THE ONLY TIME YOU WILL HEAR, "BROTHER JASON, STOP HARPING ON THAT IS ON RESURRECTION MORNING WHEN I WON'T EVER HAVE TO SAY IT AGAIN." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THESE EVIL SPIRITS ARE REAL. THESE DARK ANGELS, THESE DARK FORCES, WE CANNOT BE COMFORTABLE WITH WEARING OUR ARMOR in completely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; OR INCORRECTLY. ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SEE, so these WERE THE THINGS THAT THAT THE THAT THE FOUNDING UH YOU KNOW, WHEN I BEGAN TO RESEARCH THESE THESE B THESE RESTORATION UH MINISTRIES, that was one of the THINGS THAT LUTHER SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON ABOUT ignorance in scripture AND AND PEOPLE DON'T READ THEIR BIBLES AND AND YOU AND LUTHER WOULD SAY, YOU CAN'T WIELD THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT EFFECTIVELY. YOU SEE, SO this was THIS WAS LUTHER'S STRONGEST ARGUMENT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU KNOW FEEDING UPON THE WORD OF GOD CONTINUALLY. AND SO UH YOU KNOW SATAN UM HE HE TRIES UM YOU KNOW TO MAKE PEOPLE UNINTERESTED IN THE WORD OF GOD. AND AND AND LISTEN FRIENDS, THAT'S THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING HERE AT THE END TIME. AND HE AND I WANT TO SAY THIS TO YOU TODAY BEFORE I MOVE TO MY MY FINAL CLOSING ARGUMENT. HE'S NOT JUST TRYING TO STOP INDIVIDUALS. HE'S TRYING TO STOP WHOLE FAMILIES. HE'S TRYING TO STOP BY EXTENSION WHOLE ASSEMBLIES. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, IS THIS ASSEMBLY IMPORTANT?" THAT THIS ASSEMBLY I MEAN, WHAT IF THIS IS THE WHAT IF THERE'S ONLY ONE ASSEMBLY IN THE WHOLE WORLD THAT GOES IN THE RAPTURE? I'D LIKE IT TO BE THIS ONE. IF THERE'S ONLY THE FAMILIES WE HAVE HERE, I'M POSITIVE THERE'LL BE MANY THOUSANDS MORE. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL OF THESE FAMILIES ARE ARE READY ON resurrection morning. See, AND SO HE'S TRYING TO STOP THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY, NOT ONLY OF THIS ONE, BUT OF ANY CHURCH, THE WARFARE. I I USED TO SAY THIS TO MY TEENAGE SONS WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP. THIS IS LARGER THAN YOU. SATAN'S NOT JUST TRYING TO WRECK YOU. IF HE CAN WRECK YOU, HE WRECKS ME AND YOUR MOTHER. HE WRECKS OUR NAME. AND IF HE WRECKS OUR NAME, HE WRECKS THE CHURCH. THIS IS LARGER THAN YOU. QUIT, YOU KNOW, HAVE MORE VISION THAN OVER THE END OF YOUR NOSE. LOOK AT THE LARGER PICTURE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO THIS IS WHY WE DON'T LIVE SELFISHLY. THIS IS WHY WE'RE ALL IN THIS THING TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY WE LOVE AND FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER. THIS IS WHY WE PRAY FOR ONE ANOTHER. THIS IS WHY WE DON'T JUDGE ONE ANOTHER &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S THE STRENGTH OF AN ASSEMBLY. SEE, SO YOU KNOW, THIS WAS THIS WAS TH THIS IS WHAT SATAN DOES. AND HIS FINAL VICTORY IS ALWAYS ABOUT division and isolation. And it's a shame how many churches he has divided and how many people that he has isolated over the years. Brother Brandham says it this way. I need 10 minutes. He says, "And is it I be not afraid?" Maybe in this great day of prosperity that WE'VE BEEN SO INTERESTED IN prosperity till we've here it is again left off the main thing. Maybe we've gone off on some kind of tantrum without him. See I mean LISTEN LISTEN FRIENDS WHEN brother Brandham WHEN HE SAW THE VISION OF THE PREVIEW OF THE BRIDE IT WAS ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS. YES. &gt;&gt; MARCHING AS TO WAR. NOT MARCHING TO WALMART. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Not marching to the world. &gt;&gt; Marching as to war. &gt;&gt; You understand? UH IT'S NOT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, BETTER HOUSES AND OR CARS OR MORE LANDS OR MORE LIKES. AND BROTHER JASON, IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH IMPROVING MY LIFE? NOPE. &gt;&gt; NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AT ALL. BUT HAVE YOU LEFT OFF THE MAIN THING? &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS GREAT DAY OF PROSPERITY. Luther in a in a in A IN A SUMMATION CAPSULE, LUTHER'S WHOLE plan was about being strong IN THE WORD OF GOD. YOU ARE, HE SAYS HERE, AND I'M QUOTING HIM, YOU'RE REALLY STRONG IN HIS IN HIS 1533 SERMON ON THE CHRISTIAN armor and weapons. He explains the meaning of each piece of armor. YOU'RE REALLY STRONG AND FIRM and you remained UNCONQUERED WHEN YOU'RE CONSTANTLY IN THE WORD OF GOD. FOR EXAMPLE, THE THE having our loins gird about with TRUTH MEANS LIVING AN UPRIGHT LIFE IN ALL SINCERITY FREE from hypocrisy. LIKEWISE, PUTTING ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUS MEANS MAINTAINING A BLAMELESS RIGHTEOUS LIFE SO TO DEAL FAIRLY WITH ALL MEN. SEE, WESLEY LIKEWISE EMPHASIZED THE NECESSITY OF THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. And even notes that the GREEK TERM FOR WHOLE ARMOR in Ephesians 6 means a complete suit of armor. WE'RE NOT. AND WESLEY SAYS WE'RE NOT TO PUT ON ONLY ONE PIECE AS IF ARMOR IS SCARCE. &gt;&gt; ARMOR IS NOT SCARCE. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE SEVEN THE WHOLE SEVEN SEALS OPEN. SEE? SO HE SAYS OMISSION OF ANY PART OF THE ARMOR. Omission of any part. I want you TO REALLY TRY TO FOCUS YOURSELF. YOU SEEM QUIET. MAYBE MAYBE YOU'RE NOT USED to me going in a little bit of overtime. Maybe this sub subject is making you uncomfortable. Give me your undivided attention. I'm not saying somebody's not. I sometimes that's true. That's not what I'm meaning now. I just I just sense a tiredness of your mind. You good? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is important. The devil would like nothing better than to send your brain somewhere shopping. &gt;&gt; All right. He doesn't like this kind of preaching. Dark forces are against this kind of preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wesley would go on to say that it must be the whole armor for strength and stability to our adversaries. In Wesley's words, nothing less than the full equipment will SUFFICE FOR SUCH A BATTLE. HE WOULD SAY THIS, "OMISSION OF ANY PART OF THE armor or corresponding spiritual duty." Pink um cabbage is down on duty as well. It leaves a believer vulnerable. ARE YOU WILLING TO ACCEPT THE ADVICE OF YOUR SIXTH CHURCH AGE MESSENGER? &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT'LL LEAVE YOU VULNERABLE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ON ALL THE ARMOR. THE ISUZA STREET FATHERS CARRIED ON WITH THE WHOLE THE WHOLE SPIRITUAL ARMOR. FROM THE APOSTOLIC FAITH PAPERS, you can read where THEY'RE CONSTANTLY EXHORTING THAT IN THESE LAST DAYS WHEN THE POWER OF HELL AND THE CLOUDS OF DARKNESS ARE GATHERING OVER THIS OLD WORLD. LISTEN, God will hold CHRISTIANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SOULS OF MEN. BROTHER BRANDHAM TAUGHT THAT. SEE, THEREFORE, WE MUST HAVE ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. ARTHUR PINK STRESSED THAT GOD HAD PROVIDED AMPLE ARMOR, but each believer IS RESPONSIBLE TO TAKE IT up &gt;&gt; and use it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; PINK WROTE THAT THE CHRISTIAN LIFE IS A FIERCE BATTLE requiring complete DEPENDENCE ON GOD'S STRENGTH. OUR SECOND GREATEST need is TO BE WELLARMED FOR THE CONFLICT WE FACE DAILY. HE CONCLUDES BY SAYING, "IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO STAND AGAINST THE WOWS OF THE DEVIL UNLESS WE AVAIL OURSELVES OF THE FULL PROVISION GOD HAS MADE FOR OUR DEFENSE. THE ARMOR IS A GIFT, BUT THE DUTY IS OURS. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO ACTIVELY PUT IT ON." SEE, AND SO HE HE GOES ON TO SAY, "GOD DOESN'T DOES NOT UH FIT IT ON US. HE PLACES IT BEFORE US. AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. WIGGLESWORTH, RIGHT BEFORE I COME TO BROTHER BRANDHAM, WIGGLESWORTH, I LOVE my goodness, what a this is this is a man who who had probably the most supernatural ministry maybe that next to William Brandham I've ever read. And I've read his whole life and his memoirs. I have all of his books and all of his writings and all of his testimonies. This man, this man is the same man who one time stood a dead man up in his corner and commanded him to come back to life in the name of Jesus Christ. And the man did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he'd already been dead for hours. And even his wife said, "Honey, you've went over. You you've went too far this time." She tried to discourage him. And he put her out of the room and said, "I said, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ." He didn't, you know, sometimes they had to get on him because sometimes he'd punch people. they'd come up with a a cancer in their stomach and he'd haul off and double them over and the cancer be gone. So, I don't know if I want to do that, but that was where his faith was. You know, he he come up out of that Welsh revival and and out of the Isuza Street revival. He had a lot to say to the Pentecostal movement. AND UM SO THEN WE COME TO BROTHER BRANDHAM finally and brother Brham takes AN INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT I READ WHETHER IT WAS Luther or or Wesley OR THE ISUZA FATHERS or Pink or Wigglesworth, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID AND TAUGHT all of those things all through the quotes. I'm I could put 20 quotes today just augmenting their points. But I want to take the last point today IS THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM ACTUALLY TAKES ALL OF THEIR POINTS IN ONE SUMMATION, ONE ENORMOUS POINT AND JUST GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE WALL WITH IT. And he he teaches THAT THE FULL ARMOR OF GOD I IT'S NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF AS JUST I GOT TO PUT THIS PART, I GOT TO PUT THAT PART, I GOT TO GET THIS PART, I GOT TO GET THAT PART. THE FULL ARMOR OF GOD IS NOTHING LESS THAN GOD'S own presence and spirit living within the believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham taught us THAT ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, WHAT CAME DOWN WAS THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD SAY THE TOKEN HAS TO BE ON DISPLAY. THAT'S THE ONLY THING THE DEVIL WILL RECOGNIZE. HE'LL RECOGNIZE THAT BLOODY SACRIFICE OF THE BLEEDING WORD THAT YOU HAVE NOT ONLY RECEIVED AND BELIEVED, BUT YOU HAVE ACTED UPON IT AND YOU HAVE HAD YOUR WHOLE LIFE CONVERTED AND YOU ARE NOW THE BLOOD OF GOD BY THE SPIRIT. AND THAT IS THE POWER THAT'S WITHIN THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT IT IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE TOKEN LIFE, SATAN'S most effective strategy, than is to do anything he can to lure you away on a daily basis, to lure you away from those things operating in your life that add daily strength and grit to your testimony. Now, if he can pull that off, if he can pull it off, then he can divide husbands and wives. &gt;&gt; He can divide parents from children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can divide congregations from their pastor. He can divide congregants from each other. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he can divide homes and families and churches, then it does not matter how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine. &gt;&gt; He will have absolute rulership over your lives, this church, over everything that you love. Satan will take away from you everything that you love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You hear me, young people? That's we're a we're an army. We're supposed to be marching in sync. I've got a demonstration by Mark Robber at one of one of the engineering sites that that I've watched for years and really like his stuff. And he did uh uh I forget the the the it's all it's all pure science. And he did a demonstration using metronomes. Let's pull that up. Sarah, don't start it till I tell you. Just have that have that up and running. We have it ready. Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh, let's see. Brother Matt, where are you? Um, okay. Now, hold it, Sarah. Stop right there, sister. All right. Now, that's perfect. What you're going to notice is there are two metronomes on this board. You'll notice there's Mark Robber. You'll notice that the board is held aloft by what looks like two aluminum cans. Now, this is important because this is pure this is pure physics that these metronomes are going to be out of sync. But because that they're resting on a and let me just put it in this language, a living platform that that moves that actually the movement of the metronomes moves the floor on the rollers and magically almost that rocking motion starts feeding energy back into the metronomes and they start feeding each other and the whole thing becomes a dynamic of Mr. and Mrs. Jesus Christ working in perfect harmony. And you're going to don't be don't be worried. Don't be worried. No matter how bad they look out of sync, they're going to come in sync perfectly. Moreover, you're going to be tempted to go, "Oh, that's close enough. That's Yeah, they're pretty much in sync." No, no, no. Just hold on. They come into perfect sync. This is now see when you're when you're resting on a rigid denominational f I mean board like that when you're resting on a man-made rigid BOARD OF DOCTRINE OR WHEN YOUR LIFE IS JUST A rigid board of doctrine &gt;&gt; your your home won't have harmony your church won't have harmony parents to children won't have harmony you've got to have the living word as your foundation it's not about and I don't MEAN LIVING WORD AS IN EACH AGE GOD all lots more of his word. I'M TALKING ABOUT friends the interaction of you and Christ. &gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CHURCH AND JESUS INTERACTING TOGETHER LIVING IN THE EARTH IN 2025. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let me ask YOU A QUESTION BEFORE WE BEFORE WE HIT PLAY. We're at the end of 2025 to my shock and dismay &gt;&gt; and I've had to look back and go, am I coming to the end and I've got a communion and footwashing in a few days. Am I coming to the end of this year? Am I satisfied that I've that I've used this year productively and that I'm coming to the end of this year and I'm stronger and more faithful to the Lord and more on fire than I was at the end of 2024? Or might have I just wasted away and this year just went like that and blew past me and I'm finding that I don't even have the spiritual height that I had a year ago. I just want to say this to you. I don't want to leave you with that. I'm not saying that to discourage you. I'm going to show you the remedy. And that remedy is get into harmony with the Holy Ghost. Get into harmony with the word of God. Or you, I promise you, you'll burn through 2026 just as fast and you will have made no progress. And this time next year, you'll still be wondering, "Why is the power of God not operating in my life and in my home?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's your remedy. Now watch. Go ahead, sir. Look at the cans moving under it. Perfect. Let's add them. Let's Let's quadruple them. Let's get a bigger church. [Applause] Oh, everybody's out of order. No harmony. What do we do? Just wait. Keep waiting. We need a bigger church. Let's get so many diverse people from different cultures, different beliefs, different backgrounds. There's no chance we can get this church in harmony. You can't you can't even get yourself there. What? When you live on the living word, your whole life comes into sync. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is what being a real warrior in spiritual warfare can do for you. I don't know what kind of stand with me. I don't know right here. This is my last Sunday service in 2025. If the Lord wills, I'll preach the first one Sunday in 2026. If the Lord wills, we'll all be in the rapture before then. If the Lord wills, we'll all be back here for a service. And I can tell you this much. I'm going to be continuing in this series to show you how important it is to have your life in harmony with the word of God. And God has a word for you to be in harmony with. You're not left to figure out how to defeat these dark angels and get them out of your home, get them out of your life, get them out of your kids. I'm here to tell you something, friends. He is more than able today. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads. Whatever you choose, Sister Deb. Father, we thank you for this word today. And as I come here, Lord, to this last Sunday sermon in this year, we see it slipping away very quickly. We're going to gather just in a few days, Lord, and have the Lord's supper and the foot washing and it'll be the last service that we have in this year. How many more years that we have? Who can say? We don't know. Brother Brandham taught us that you'll never let us know. You'll that's a flat statement. You'll never He'll never let us know. All we know is that we're close. And we see the world slipping further and further into madness and chaos. We see that 30 33,000 different denominations, they can never get all of those metronomes in harmony because they're on a stiff foundation. There's no unseen force at work. But for us, Lord, we rest upon the living word. The movement of the Holy Spirit in our lives is what synchronizes us. the movement of the Holy Spirit under that foundation that we are standing upon today, that living foundation of God's word that desires, Lord, you you you you showed us in the scripture how that this great mystery that had been hidden since the ages, now it wants fellowship. the desire of this great mystery so that we we deduce then that the great mystery is not doctrine. The great mystery is not programmed. The great mystery wants fellowship. This great revealed mystery is a person of Christ in his word and he desires to have this kind of fellowship in our lives. I pray that you'll help us today Lord. We come down to the end. We saw a a little example, Father, from a a worldly engineer, a fine man as far as I know, but it's just an example, Lord, of what is possible when there's a living foundation under the chaos. It brings it back into harmony. I pray today for anyone here today, Lord, under the sound of my voice. And we're going to let the people go, but just before we do, Lord, would you look down into our hearts today? I'm sure that this word has penetrated them as it penetrated me. I feel perfectly satisfied. I'm grateful to you, Lord, because as I stand here right now, I feel a perfect sense of satisfaction in my soul that what was needed to be said today was said effectively and I said it all. Now, there's more to say, but it wasn't for today. And I knew that and I'm grateful. Now, I pray you'll deal with hearts. Let the Holy Spirit who brought the word now deal with hearts cuz it's going to take you Lord to make it a reality to each individual person. I don't know where each individual person sees themselves on the spectrum uh Lord of how their relationship to God is but I know that as believers Lord we want to be right. We want to be right. I want to be in right standing Lord. I want to be in right standing. I want to be in harmony. I want to be in sync. I I want to I WANT TO BE UNIFIED. I WANT THAT MIND which was in Christ to operate through me. I pray you will grant it today. Lord, we commit it to you now. Deal with hearts as we worship just a little bit in Jesus name. Amen. Let's sing it, my brother. When I come to die. [Music] Oh, when I come to die. When I come to die. &gt;&gt; Give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, give me Jesus.
