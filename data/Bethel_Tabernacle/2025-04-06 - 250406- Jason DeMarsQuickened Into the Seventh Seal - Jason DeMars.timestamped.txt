[34:49] whether this whether this preacher can
[34:51] do a good job or not, Lord. But we want
[34:53] to come and have our faith connect to
[34:55] you,
[34:57] Lord, not to man. We want your spirit to
[35:00] come and speak to us and deal with us,
[35:03] encourage us, and challenge us and
[35:05] strengthen us. Lord, we want to grow in
[35:07] you. We want this to be feeding on the
[35:11] unfailing body word of the son of man in
[35:13] this hour. Lord, we commit ourselves to
[35:16] you to that end. Lord, anoint us and
[35:18] fill us with your spirit in Jesus' name.
[35:21] Amen.
[35:22] God bless you all. Going to speak this
[35:25] morning on being quickened into the
[35:27] seventh seal. And I'm just going to have
[35:29] you go ahead and sit down.
[35:42] the Lord has brought to us in this day
[35:46] uh incredible
[35:48] revelation of the mysteries of the
[35:49] Bible. I think sometimes we take that
[35:52] for granted not realizing what
[35:55] incredible grace and revelation the Lord
[35:58] has brought to us in this hour. You
[36:02] know, some sometimes you don't really
[36:04] understand the value. If you grew up in
[36:05] the message and you don't you you you
[36:07] this is what you're feasting on from the
[36:09] time you're a child. you miss the value
[36:12] of it sometimes. And uh don't don't fail
[36:16] to understand that. Don't fail to grasp
[36:19] it. I guess we could say no matter what,
[36:22] whether you grew up or didn't, it takes
[36:23] a spiritual revelation to really catch
[36:26] the reality of what God is doing in this
[36:29] hour.
[36:31] So understanding then that in the under
[36:34] the seventh seal, thank you. under the
[36:38] seventh seal that is to finish the
[36:40] mystery of God.
[36:42] And brother Brandham preached the sermon
[36:43] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[36:45] He said it was a three-fold mystery,
[36:47] three parts to it. God fully revealed in
[36:50] Christ,
[36:52] right? God f fully in in fullness in the
[36:57] bride to gain preeminence in this hour.
[37:01] That just happened. Brother Brandham
[37:02] said that's 1963. He says the seventh
[37:04] seal, that's the coming of the Lord.
[37:07] And so we've we've seen that and we've
[37:09] witnessed that. So there's a transition
[37:11] that's taken place. The last part is to
[37:14] restore us back to Eden to oneness
[37:17] of the man and his wife, Christ and the
[37:21] bride, the second Adam and the second
[37:24] Eve, the one that won't fail.
[37:28] So knowing who we are, what sunship
[37:30] means is absolutely critical to making
[37:33] the rapture. If we don't if if God isn't
[37:37] revealed to us, then who we are isn't
[37:40] revealed to us. Then there's really no
[37:43] way for us to be made ready and prepared
[37:46] for the rapture.
[37:50] And and these things are critical. It
[37:51] has to be a spiritual revelation. You
[37:54] know, brother Brandham says we can never
[37:56] pray too much for revelation.
[37:59] We should always be praying for
[38:01] spiritual revelation because that is the
[38:03] means and that is the channel that God
[38:05] is working in us to grow us. There's
[38:09] many things that accompany that, but
[38:11] that is the main channel. There's no
[38:14] life outside of that.
[38:17] You can mimic life. You can you you know
[38:20] over the years you can do your best to
[38:21] try to follow all the rules of the
[38:24] message but that's not the life.
[38:28] Following following a list and set of
[38:30] rules any religion does that. The
[38:34] message produces the same as well but
[38:36] that's not the real thing.
[38:39] The real thing is the life. That's what
[38:41] God has been trying to express and
[38:43] manifest from the beginning. And so
[38:45] understanding when we catch the
[38:47] revelation of Melkisedc
[38:50] in it that is where the revelation of
[38:52] who we are comes forth. And so
[38:57] another part of that understanding is
[39:00] just as the Jews
[39:02] under the under the first age under the
[39:05] day of Pentecost had to make a
[39:07] transition from the law to Christ. So,
[39:11] do we in the in the last days, we have
[39:14] to make a transition from a closed book
[39:17] to an open book. We have to make a
[39:20] transition from waiting for the coming
[39:22] of the Lord to experience the revelation
[39:27] of the coming of the Lord.
[39:31] That's what the seventh seal is all
[39:32] about. It's not just about
[39:35] it's not facts or information. The first
[39:38] six seals we could say it's information,
[39:40] right? He's revealing us to us
[39:44] different
[39:46] different pictures, different parts,
[39:47] different portions. But when it comes to
[39:50] the seventh seal is left off,
[39:54] right? Why? Why is that? Because the
[39:56] seventh seal is a person. It's not
[39:59] information. It's a revelation of a
[40:01] person to you. And when that revelation
[40:03] of that person is made known to you, now
[40:05] you understand who you are.
[40:08] in him.
[40:10] So the lamb took the book in 1963,
[40:13] broke the seals, put us and he put us
[40:16] into a new process. He put us into
[40:19] something we're calling rapturing faith,
[40:22] right? And I I don't want to preach a
[40:25] whole another message on it because it
[40:26] is a whole another message. But if you
[40:29] if you look at rapturing faith, brother
[40:30] Brandham's constantly saying the church
[40:33] is starting to catch the message,
[40:36] right? They're starting to catch the
[40:38] message. The only thing wrong with those
[40:41] who are catching the message is that
[40:43] they need need to lay in the presence of
[40:45] the sun to ripen and let that word bake
[40:48] down deep. That maturing process is what
[40:51] he's talking about.
[40:54] And so that is the process that we've
[40:55] entered into now.
[40:57] Christ was
[40:59] mediating. He was there. He was
[41:01] interceding for the ignorance of the
[41:03] people under denominational ages. But
[41:05] when the full mysteries are revealed,
[41:08] Christ comes down with an open book. He
[41:11] cries with a loud voice, seven thunders
[41:12] under their voices. And what is it? In
[41:14] the days of the voice of the seventh
[41:16] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[41:18] mystery of God should be finished. So,
[41:22] who is the one that brings to us the
[41:24] revelation of the open book? Seven
[41:26] thunders. How does how does it come to
[41:29] you and I?
[41:31] The prophet. That's how God deals every
[41:34] age. He always sends a man to speak to
[41:37] us through. And so the seventh angel
[41:39] brings the mystery. What mystery? The
[41:42] book. It was hidden to d even to Daniel.
[41:45] Daniel said, "I heard, but I understood
[41:47] not."
[41:49] He says, "What shall the end of these
[41:50] things be?" He says, "Go your way,
[41:53] Daniel. It's sealed up and closed until
[41:56] the time of the end. What's sealed up
[41:58] and closed? The understanding, the
[42:00] revelation of the word was sealed up and
[42:04] closed. So what needed to be opened? A
[42:06] revelation of the word needed to be
[42:08] opened to us. That's what happened in
[42:10] 1963.
[42:13] And so as we look at this, we understand
[42:15] there is a transition. And I want I want
[42:16] you to see this. Just as the Jews they
[42:20] had had to transition, so do we have to
[42:22] transition. If we don't tr transition
[42:25] from the from what the interceding for
[42:28] the ignorance, are you still under
[42:30] walking under the ignorance? Do you have
[42:32] a revelation of the word yet? Do you
[42:35] know who he is? Do you know who you are?
[42:36] If you have the revelation, you've made
[42:38] the transition. But that transition took
[42:40] place in 1963 when the lamb took the
[42:43] book and broke the seals. Now he's in
[42:45] the final works of redemption. He's the
[42:48] book of redemption is open. It's not
[42:51] closed anymore. It's open to us. We've
[42:53] entered into a new phase of redemption.
[42:56] 1 Peter 15 says there's salvation
[43:00] ready to be revealed or unveiled in the
[43:03] last time. So I thought I thought it was
[43:07] all at Calvary. The price was paid at
[43:09] Calvary.
[43:12] Absolutely. The price was paid as Cal
[43:14] Calvary. But redemption means taking
[43:16] possession. And in order to take
[43:18] possession, Christ had to take the book
[43:21] because the book is the title deed to
[43:23] redemption. Everything that God's will
[43:26] is on that book. His last will in
[43:29] testament for the for his gentile bride
[43:32] is in that book. Our inheritance is in
[43:34] that book. So when that book was loosed
[43:36] and and and and open to us, the
[43:39] revelation of it, but also the reality
[43:41] of it comes comes to us because God's
[43:44] purpose wasn't merely that the open book
[43:47] would come down and we would know about
[43:49] an open book because where is what's the
[43:52] what's the final destination of the open
[43:54] book?
[43:56] John was to take the book and eat the
[43:58] book, right? John being a type of the
[44:00] bride. So what are we to do?
[44:03] We're just to We're just to listen to
[44:05] tapes.
[44:07] We should listen to tapes more and more.
[44:10] But we have that's part of eating the
[44:11] book. But it's not just out there. The
[44:15] message, the open word has to come in
[44:17] here. So the revelation is in here. We
[44:21] eat the book. We become the word. Then
[44:24] it says you must prophesy again. You can
[44:26] never prophesy again until you first eat
[44:28] the book. So, you've got to catch the
[44:31] revelation of the word into into your
[44:33] soul. Have you taken the book? That's
[44:35] the question I would ask you because
[44:38] that's that's where God is dealing.
[44:39] That's the salvation that's revealed in
[44:41] the last time. It's an unveiling. In
[44:44] other words, it was hidden. We knew that
[44:46] there was a salvation coming. We knew
[44:48] that the lamb was going to take the
[44:49] book. But what does that mean? Well, now
[44:52] we know what it means.
[44:55] I hope you do. If you haven't listened
[44:58] to the message,
[45:01] take the book. The book, John had to
[45:05] take the book from the hand of the
[45:06] angel. He had to eat the book and then
[45:10] he was given the command to prophesy.
[45:12] And again, so you see there is a great
[45:13] transition that takes place.
[45:17] People want to say, well, I just I just
[45:19] believe in Jesus. Who is Jesus?
[45:24] Who is Jesus? first of all. Second of
[45:27] all, what does Jesus instruct us to do?
[45:31] Because we can go back all through
[45:34] church history and see there's there's
[45:36] transition periods. Brother Brandham in
[45:39] the rapture me message says we're
[45:41] changing dispensations.
[45:44] We're turning a corner, right? He said
[45:47] the true bride is waiting for the
[45:49] revelation of the rapture.
[45:51] He says the rapture which is coming to
[45:54] pass. So, we've entered into when as
[45:57] soon as the book is open, we're entering
[46:00] into the final phase of redemption.
[46:03] So, the question is, have you made the
[46:05] transition?
[46:09] Haven't got to my text yet.
[46:12] Galatians 3. Let's read. Let's stand
[46:15] together and we'll read.
[46:19] Praise the Lord.
[46:22] Wherefore the law was our school master
[46:24] to bring us unto Christ,
[46:28] that we might be justified by faith. But
[46:30] after that faith is come, we are no
[46:33] longer under a school master. For you
[46:36] are all the children of God by faith
[46:40] in Christ Jesus.
[46:42] For as many of you as have been baptized
[46:44] into Christ have put on Christ. There is
[46:48] neither Jew nor Greek.
[46:53] There's neither bond nor free. There's
[46:54] neither male nor female. For you are all
[46:57] one in Christ Jesus. And if you be
[47:00] Christs, then are you Abraham's seed and
[47:03] hes according to the promise. God bless.
[47:05] You can be seated.
[47:10] So the the the the big picture looking
[47:14] at
[47:16] the book of Galatians is Paul is dealing
[47:20] with people who they've had an
[47:22] experience with God, but then false
[47:24] teachers are coming along and trying to
[47:26] tell them you have to in order to
[47:29] receive the Holy Ghost, you actually
[47:30] have to get circumcised and you have to
[47:32] obey the law of Moses. You have to
[47:33] convert first to Judaism. then you can
[47:38] receive the Holy Spirit. Right? And so
[47:41] Paul when he's going in and speaking
[47:43] about different examples, he uses one of
[47:45] them as adoption. And of course we we
[47:48] understand when we're looking at
[47:50] adoption, it's not our English word of
[47:52] adoption where you take someone who's
[47:55] not your child and then make them your
[47:58] child. That's not the context. In in
[48:02] Galatians 4:11, it says the heir as long
[48:05] as he's a child. So it's talking about
[48:07] inheritance. It's talking about
[48:09] receiving an inheritance. It's talking
[48:11] about a ch your child. That's the pos
[48:14] that's the position. The word adopt
[48:17] that's translated adoption into the into
[48:19] the Bible is the word huothesia. This is
[48:22] the Greek word. This is two parts to the
[48:24] word. Huos is simply means sons, right?
[48:29] And thesia means placing. So it's
[48:32] speaking of the placing of sons. And
[48:35] it's talking about an inheritance. So
[48:38] when we're looking at this picture, you
[48:40] have to see that this is talking about a
[48:42] land, a landowning family. He's training
[48:46] his son. He's put him under a school
[48:47] master. He's put him under tutors. He's
[48:49] making him ready in order to enter into
[48:52] his position as an adult, fully mature
[48:56] adult son. That's what it's talking
[48:59] about. And so Paul is telling telling
[49:01] the Galatians
[49:04] all through this, who has bewitched you?
[49:08] He's asking them the the question in a
[49:10] multiple different places. How did you
[49:12] receive the spirit? We'll we'll read
[49:14] that in a moment. Just trying to just
[49:17] lay the lay the background a little bit.
[49:22] So there's a transition that they needed
[49:23] to make that God was going to make
[49:25] dispensationally. Let's look think of it
[49:27] that way. Through the whole plan of
[49:29] salvation and God's plan through
[49:31] history, he he had a transition from
[49:35] what? From the law unto Christ, right?
[49:39] So they they were children.
[49:42] They were in that position. But the law
[49:43] was simply the tutor, the pedagogue, the
[49:47] teacher, the one who was instructing
[49:49] them. This is how I want this is how I
[49:52] your father is going to want the
[49:53] property run. This is how this is how
[49:56] you need to behave yourself. This is the
[49:58] kind of character that you need to have.
[49:59] This is the kind of language and and
[50:03] history and all those things that go
[50:05] along with it. And so that's God was
[50:08] bringing them using the law giving them
[50:10] the culture of God's nature and God's
[50:13] purpose. But it was just a tutor. It
[50:15] wasn't the end in itself. The Jews have
[50:18] still to this day treated the law as an
[50:21] end in in itself. But Paul is trying to
[50:24] show them it's only a school master to
[50:26] bring you to Christ. It's your your your
[50:29] adoption is because where it says in uh
[50:34] you are all children of God by faith in
[50:38] Jesus Christ. That word children, let me
[50:40] pull it up.
[50:44] That word children that you see there is
[50:46] that same word that's part of adoption
[50:48] where I said huyssia. This is for you
[50:52] are all wos of God by faith in Christ
[50:55] Jesus. You're sons of God. So you enter
[50:58] into your position of sunship. How? By
[51:02] the works of the law. No, by faith in
[51:06] Christ Jesus. So this is the this is
[51:09] God's transition process. You you want
[51:13] you want to enter into full adoption,
[51:17] receive Christ by faith. That's what
[51:19] Paul is trying to say, right? And that
[51:22] that's that's the point that I was
[51:24] looking at is there's a transition.
[51:26] There's also a transition in this hour.
[51:30] The lamb took the book. Amen. You
[51:32] believe he took the book? Believe he
[51:33] opened all seven seals.
[51:36] You You believe he's come down with that
[51:38] open book? Have you taken it? Are you
[51:41] eat are you eating it? Okay. So there's
[51:45] a transition that takes place
[51:48] from this direction to this direction.
[51:51] And you read you read through brother
[51:52] Brandham's sermons on adoption. The the
[51:55] church is always trying to go after what
[51:57] God was doing in the past. I'm going to
[52:00] do it this way. We're going to do we're
[52:01] going to we're you speak in tongues and
[52:03] you got the Holy Ghost. No character.
[52:06] Brother Brandham said there's no
[52:07] character. There's no character of
[52:09] Christ. You continue on in ungodliness.
[52:12] There's a completion to this whole whole
[52:14] picture. A full restoration. Pentecostal
[52:17] movement. Isuza Street was not the full
[52:19] restoration.
[52:21] The the Isuza Street was not the Eagle
[52:24] Age. What the Eagle Age did not come
[52:26] until 1963.
[52:30] It was still the man age. They were
[52:32] still under the age of the reformers.
[52:35] There's a transition that takes place
[52:38] when those seals are open. Salvation has
[52:40] been unveiled to us. It's not a mystery
[52:44] anymore.
[52:45] There's two parts of redemption. He paid
[52:47] the price at Calvary.
[52:50] But he has to claim his property. He can
[52:53] only claim come and claim that property
[52:55] if he takes the book.
[52:58] So it's been revealed to us. Let's go on
[53:01] to my quote I want to read from. It is
[53:03] the rising of the sun.
[53:08] And in that day, they didn't know what
[53:11] it was.
[53:13] He's talking about the the picture of
[53:14] the cloud, the one that I had up at the
[53:16] beginning. That day, they didn't know
[53:19] what it was. And we knew, just look,
[53:21] just look this away. And it's our Lord
[53:23] up there. See, he's the one that opened
[53:26] those seals. He is those seals. For the
[53:29] whole word of God is Christ, and Christ
[53:32] is the seals that was opened. What is
[53:34] the opening of the seals then? Revealing
[53:36] Christ.
[53:38] And the very seven angels which
[53:39] represented the seven churches all
[53:41] completed and we couldn't even see it.
[53:44] They did. They took the picture, not us.
[53:46] And there he is standing there, supreme
[53:49] judge, showing that he's alpha and
[53:51] omega, the beginning at the end. What
[53:54] identification? Quickening power did
[53:56] that to us. Quickening power lets us see
[53:59] his coming. Did you hear that sentence?
[54:02] Quickening power lets us see his coming.
[54:06] Amen. It's our Lord up there, the
[54:09] supreme judge, the white-wiged one that
[54:12] lets quickening power opens our eyes to
[54:15] see the revelation of who is being
[54:17] revealed. It's not William Brandon being
[54:19] revealed. It's Christ.
[54:23] And quickening power is what opens our
[54:25] eyes to see the reality of the
[54:27] revelation of the seventh seal, the
[54:30] coming of the Lord. Quickening power
[54:32] snatched us from death to life. You see
[54:35] what a transition has taken place.
[54:40] Amen. I believe in Jesus. How many
[54:42] believes in Jesus? Amen. That was Jesus.
[54:47] 1963 that came down the white-wiged one,
[54:51] supreme authority, supreme deity,
[54:52] supreme judge.
[54:54] Hallelujah.
[54:57] All right, that's the end of my
[54:58] PowerPoint.
[55:00] Galatians 3. Brother Mark, you're going
[55:02] to have fun.
[55:05] May God pray for brother Mark.
[55:08] Galatians 3:10.
[55:11] I'm just going to go. For as many as are
[55:14] of the works of the law are under the
[55:15] curse. For it is written, "Cursed is
[55:18] everyone that continuth not in all the
[55:20] things which are written in the book of
[55:23] the law to do them. But that no man is
[55:25] justified by the law in the sight of
[55:27] God. It is evident, for the just shall
[55:30] live by faith, and the law is not of
[55:31] faith. But the man that doeth them shall
[55:34] live in them. Christ has redeemed us
[55:36] from the curse of the law, being made a
[55:39] curse for us. For it is written, "Cursed
[55:41] is everyone that hangs on a tree, that
[55:44] the blessing of Abraham might come on
[55:46] the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that
[55:48] we might receive the promise of the
[55:51] spirit through faith." Amen. So, this is
[55:55] what he's trying to get to the
[55:57] Galatians. You receive the promise of
[55:59] the spirit through what? Works of the
[56:01] law.
[56:03] through faith.
[56:05] You heard the word preached, you
[56:08] believed it, and you received the Holy
[56:10] Spirit.
[56:12] That's how the blessing of Abraham comes
[56:14] on to the Gentiles.
[56:16] And Paul writing there, he's trying to
[56:18] emphasize to us, even under the law,
[56:21] they weren't saved by perfect obedience
[56:24] to the law because no one can do that.
[56:29] From the very beginning, God had a
[56:30] covenant. What was what what was that
[56:33] covenant that God had from the
[56:34] beginning? He gave it to Abraham, right?
[56:38] But remember, even Abel was saved by it.
[56:42] What was he saved by?
[56:46] Abel by faith offered unto God a more
[56:50] excellent sacrifice.
[56:52] So, it's faith. From the very beginning,
[56:56] God was saving man by faith. That is his
[57:00] covenant. Now he's he but he's
[57:01] progressively revealing himself more and
[57:03] more. He comes to Abraham and says,
[57:06] "This is how it shall be for you,
[57:07] Abraham.
[57:09] What what if Abraham does this? We saw
[57:11] Abraham do it all. He made all the
[57:14] mistakes. He did all the dumb things. He
[57:17] tried to bring he tried to bring the
[57:19] word to pass on his own. He tried to run
[57:22] away. Run, run here and run there. We
[57:25] saw all the mistakes. What was God at
[57:27] the end say?
[57:29] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[57:32] God through unbelief. Dear God, what are
[57:34] you looking at?
[57:38] He wasn't looking at Abraham's behavior.
[57:42] No one could read through Genesis and
[57:44] say, "Abraham staggered not at the
[57:46] promise of God through unbelief."
[57:49] We writing it from the human perspective
[57:51] say Abraham staggered a lot at the
[57:54] promise of God through unbelief. And we
[57:56] write we'll write the same story about
[57:58] our own self. I I don't think any of us
[58:01] are so proud of ourselves. I never
[58:02] stagger. I believed believed at every
[58:04] minute and every moment.
[58:07] Go look in the mirror again.
[58:11] But that's not what God is looking at.
[58:15] It never was what God was looking at. It
[58:18] wasn't He wasn't ever looking at our own
[58:20] works from the beginning to the end.
[58:23] Remember the blood of bulls and goats
[58:25] can never take away sins,
[58:28] right? So why did God give him that
[58:31] sacrifice? It was a type. It covered
[58:34] their sins temporarily but it put the
[58:36] put them forward till the sacrifi the
[58:39] actual real sacrifice could come which
[58:41] was God coming in for in the form of a
[58:44] man and going and becoming the sacrifice
[58:47] himself for us. And so when we think of
[58:52] the blood the blood covered Abraham
[58:56] the blood covered Adam the blood covered
[58:59] Abel the blood of Jesus Christ. See, all
[59:02] through the ages, it was the same.
[59:06] Cain offered a sacrifice,
[59:09] right?
[59:11] Cain Cain didn't have the revelation
[59:16] of what happened in the garden. And so,
[59:19] he didn't offer the blood,
[59:22] right? He just offered the fruit.
[59:27] Abel had a revelation of the word for
[59:30] that age.
[59:32] Right? None of us are going to go and
[59:34] offer a lamb
[59:38] for the forgiveness of our sins. That's
[59:40] not the word for our age, right? And so
[59:44] each age there's a word allotted to that
[59:47] time period. And so when you when you
[59:52] believe it, what is it? You were you
[59:55] were covered by the blood in every age,
[59:57] whether it's before Calvary or after
[59:59] Calvary,
[1:00:02] receiving the word that's revealed in
[1:00:04] your hour washes you in the blood
[1:00:07] because the just shall live by faith.
[1:00:12] The and the law is not of faith. Even
[1:00:14] while they were under the law, again,
[1:00:16] what was the what was the purpose of the
[1:00:17] law? So that they could be saved.
[1:00:20] That was never the intention of the law.
[1:00:23] It was simply a school master by types
[1:00:26] and shadows to lead them forward to
[1:00:30] Christ. And of course, the the the the
[1:00:32] Ten Commandments and so forth expresses
[1:00:34] the nature of God. It reveals who God is
[1:00:38] within it, but it also reveals our
[1:00:41] weakness and inability to do what God
[1:00:44] wants us to do.
[1:00:46] And so we we receive the promise by
[1:00:50] faith just like Abraham.
[1:00:53] Acts 10:44, while Peter yet spake these
[1:00:56] words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them
[1:01:00] which heard the word. So Peter is
[1:01:03] preaching. They're listening. What
[1:01:07] happens? They hear it with faith. The
[1:01:09] Holy Ghost falls on them. All right.
[1:01:12] Galatians 3 2-5.
[1:01:17] This only would I learn of you. received
[1:01:20] ye the spirit by the works of the law or
[1:01:24] by the hearing of faith.
[1:01:28] Are you so foolish, having begun in the
[1:01:30] spirit? Are you not now made perfect by
[1:01:32] the flesh?
[1:01:34] Have you suffered so many things in
[1:01:36] vain? If it yet, if it be yet in vain?
[1:01:39] He therefore that ministerth to you the
[1:01:42] spirit and workketh miracles among you
[1:01:45] doeth he it by the works of the law or
[1:01:48] by the hearing of faith. So how do you
[1:01:51] receive the spirit?
[1:01:55] By working yourself into it
[1:01:59] by emotion?
[1:02:02] No. By speaking in tongues?
[1:02:06] No. by hearing with faith.
[1:02:10] In the church age book, Brother Brandham
[1:02:11] says, "Without the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:13] Ghost, you can never have your eyes open
[1:02:15] to a true spiritual revelation of the
[1:02:17] word. A man without the spirit is blind
[1:02:21] to God and his truth."
[1:02:25] Amen. And so, it isn't it isn't by
[1:02:30] working yourself into it. It isn't by
[1:02:32] the emotion. It isn't even by coming to
[1:02:34] the altar. It isn't by praying a certain
[1:02:38] prayer,
[1:02:39] right? That's not that's not how you
[1:02:42] receive the Holy Spirit. You receive it
[1:02:44] by the hearing of faith.
[1:02:48] 1 Corinthians 2:14,
[1:02:54] "But the natural man receiveth not the
[1:02:56] things of the spirit of God, for they
[1:02:59] are foolishness unto him, neither can he
[1:03:01] know him know them, because they are
[1:03:04] spiritually discerned."
[1:03:07] So the natural man when he hears the
[1:03:09] spirit of God speaking, he rejects it.
[1:03:13] He doesn't want it. We're all born with
[1:03:15] that nature. Born in sin, shaped in
[1:03:18] iniquity. So after our human nature, we
[1:03:21] would never receive the things of the
[1:03:23] spirit of God. We would say, "That's
[1:03:26] foolish. I hate that. I don't want to
[1:03:28] hear that."
[1:03:31] Romans 10:17.
[1:03:35] You know it. You don't have to go there,
[1:03:37] Brother Mark. So then faith cometh by
[1:03:39] hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
[1:03:44] So faith comes when we when we hear the
[1:03:48] word. It has to be
[1:03:51] it's a spiritual revelation.
[1:03:54] You know faith is a revelation that God
[1:03:57] gives to you. It it goes beyond that. It
[1:04:00] creates trust. You you trust God. This
[1:04:03] is connected to faith. But you'll never
[1:04:06] get faith until God has revealed it to
[1:04:07] you.
[1:04:09] 1 Corinthians 12 3.
[1:04:15] Let you pull that up. Give you a second,
[1:04:17] brother Mark.
[1:04:20] Wherefore I give you to understand that
[1:04:22] no man speaking by the spirit of God
[1:04:25] calleth Jesus accursed and that no man
[1:04:27] can say that Jesus is the Lord but by
[1:04:30] the Holy Ghost. All right.
[1:04:34] So what what does the Apostle Paul mean
[1:04:36] when he says you can't say Lord Jesus is
[1:04:39] Lord but by the Holy Ghost because we
[1:04:41] have Matthew 7 verse 21 that says not
[1:04:45] everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord
[1:04:48] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:04:49] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:04:52] which is in heaven. Many will say to me
[1:04:54] in that day Lord Lord have we not
[1:04:56] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[1:04:58] have cast out devils and in thy name
[1:05:00] done many wonderful works? and then I
[1:05:02] will profess unto them, I never knew
[1:05:04] you. Depart from me, ye that work
[1:05:06] iniquity. So when Jesus is looking at
[1:05:08] this, there's people that are doing
[1:05:10] works, miraculous works,
[1:05:13] but they're not doing the will of the
[1:05:16] father.
[1:05:17] They're not taking the word and making
[1:05:20] it live. Right? So here you have
[1:05:23] someone, they're saying Jesus is Lord.
[1:05:25] Many people say it worldwide.
[1:05:30] Muslims believe that Jesus is the
[1:05:33] Messiah,
[1:05:34] right? They they they believe he's
[1:05:36] Messiah, that he believed that he's
[1:05:38] coming again to rule over the world, but
[1:05:41] that's not salvation.
[1:05:47] Even having an anointing,
[1:05:50] they're doing miracles. I mean, we we
[1:05:52] read over this, we don't think about it.
[1:05:54] They're doing miracles. They're doing
[1:05:56] they're releasing people from demons,
[1:05:59] right?
[1:06:01] They're
[1:06:03] they're prophesying.
[1:06:05] They're doing all these things. And you
[1:06:07] say, "Man, these are really good people.
[1:06:09] They're wow, they're so anointed. They
[1:06:11] have miracles in in in their life." And
[1:06:13] Jesus says, "Get away from me, you
[1:06:17] workers of iniquity." Why? Why? Why
[1:06:20] would he do that? They were doing good
[1:06:22] things. They obviously reverenced in
[1:06:24] their minds the name of Jesus because
[1:06:27] they were using it
[1:06:29] to cast out devils. They refused the
[1:06:32] will of the father.
[1:06:35] Right? So here you have someone saying
[1:06:38] Jesus is Lord.
[1:06:41] Think about it though. Romans 10
[1:06:44] 8 through 8 through10.
[1:06:47] We just read the the start of that.
[1:06:49] Faith comes by hearing, hearing by the
[1:06:50] word of God. says, "But what saith it,
[1:06:52] the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth
[1:06:54] and in thy heart, that is the word of
[1:06:57] faith which we preach, that if thou
[1:07:00] shalt confess
[1:07:02] uh with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
[1:07:03] shall believe in thine heart, that God
[1:07:06] has raised him from the dead, thou shalt
[1:07:07] be saved. For with the heart man
[1:07:09] believeth under righteousness, and with
[1:07:11] the mouth confession is made unto
[1:07:14] salvation." Keep going, Brother Mark.
[1:07:18] Verse 11. For the scripture saith,
[1:07:20] whosoever shall believeth on him shall
[1:07:22] not be ashamed. For there is no
[1:07:24] difference between the Jew and the
[1:07:26] Greek, for the for the same Lord over
[1:07:28] all is rich unto all that call upon him.
[1:07:31] For whosoever shall call upon the name
[1:07:34] of the Lord shall be saved. My anybody
[1:07:36] that calls on the name of the Lord will
[1:07:38] be saved. Then why does he say not
[1:07:40] everyone that calls on me Lord Lord
[1:07:43] shall enter in? We have a conundrum
[1:07:45] here. Well, let's keep reading.
[1:07:48] How shall they call on him in whom they
[1:07:50] have not believed?
[1:07:52] And how shall they believe in him who
[1:07:55] they um who of whom they have not heard?
[1:07:58] And how shall they hear without a
[1:08:01] preacher?
[1:08:02] And how shall they preach except they be
[1:08:05] sent?
[1:08:07] So what if they're not sent? What if the
[1:08:10] preacher isn't sent of God? What if the
[1:08:11] preacher is one of those guys that says,
[1:08:14] "Lord, Lord," does the miracles, but
[1:08:17] isn't doing the will of the father? See,
[1:08:21] again, we look at the book of Romans. We
[1:08:24] look at all of these and we understand
[1:08:26] this is the inspired word of God. This
[1:08:28] is the basis of our faith. And yet, we
[1:08:31] understand they didn't have 40,000
[1:08:33] denominations when Paul was writing
[1:08:36] this.
[1:08:38] They didn't have seven church ages. In
[1:08:40] fact, the church ages hadn't even begun
[1:08:42] yet when Paul was writing this.
[1:08:46] So,
[1:08:48] you know, again, we'll go we'll go
[1:08:50] forward with this. You have two men in
[1:08:54] the uh 1500s. They're both preachers. In
[1:08:59] fact, they're both Catholic.
[1:09:02] They're both monks and they're both
[1:09:04] priests and theologians.
[1:09:07] One of them comes and says, "The just
[1:09:09] shall live by faith.
[1:09:12] Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:09:14] you'll be saved. The Bible is our final
[1:09:16] authority, not the Pope." H sounds good.
[1:09:19] Another guy comes and preach and says,
[1:09:21] "Soon as a coin in the coffer rings, a
[1:09:24] soul from purgatory springs.
[1:09:28] Pay this money and you can have your
[1:09:30] sins forgiven and your family's sins
[1:09:33] forgiven." All right. They're both
[1:09:35] preachers. They both claim Jesus is
[1:09:38] Lord. But if you hear this message and
[1:09:40] hear the this message and you go with
[1:09:42] the money one, what's the what what's
[1:09:45] what do we got going on? We have a
[1:09:47] problem. And you you come you you
[1:09:50] forward this to any age. You come to
[1:09:52] this age, the same thing. What's the
[1:09:55] difference? God never sent Yan Tetsel.
[1:10:00] Johan Tetsel sent himself,
[1:10:03] right? But God sent Martin Luther,
[1:10:07] right? We we come into this age. You
[1:10:10] have you have many preachers. You have
[1:10:11] many uh theologians. Even now as we
[1:10:14] look, the church is getting more and
[1:10:16] more dead and more and more liberal
[1:10:20] around the world
[1:10:24] and they're all preaching the name of
[1:10:26] Jesus. But did God send them?
[1:10:29] Are they anoint are they anointed?
[1:10:32] Are they are they truly anointed with
[1:10:34] the Holy Ghost that's bringing forth the
[1:10:37] word? Because even then anointed. We
[1:10:40] have the anointed ones at the end time.
[1:10:42] What did the prophet reveal us to us?
[1:10:44] They're not even It's not even that
[1:10:45] they're anointed by the devil, per se.
[1:10:48] It's that they're misusing the anointing
[1:10:50] of the Holy Ghost for their own
[1:10:52] purposes. They're using the principle of
[1:10:55] faith to operate the Holy Ghost, but
[1:10:57] they have no they don't have the word.
[1:10:59] They don't have the revelation of the
[1:11:01] truth. They can't see that the seven
[1:11:04] seals are open. They put that off. Oh,
[1:11:06] that's in the tribulation period. That's
[1:11:08] for the Jews.
[1:11:11] They can't see what God is doing today.
[1:11:13] So, that's the necessity. There has to
[1:11:16] be a man that was sent from God to speak
[1:11:19] the word of God, speak the revelation of
[1:11:21] the truth. Now, you know the will of the
[1:11:23] father.
[1:11:25] What's the will of the father? It's that
[1:11:27] open book.
[1:11:30] You can cry out, "Lord, Lord," and you
[1:11:32] you you're missing the key to enter in,
[1:11:36] which is that open book.
[1:11:46] John three, we're all familiar. Jesus
[1:11:48] said, "Except a man be born again, he
[1:11:50] cannot see the kingdom of God." Run that
[1:11:53] through the table. I hope I hope you all
[1:11:56] use the table and search the message.
[1:11:58] Amen. What a treasure we have.
[1:12:02] You can't even, Brother Brandham says,
[1:12:04] you can't understand
[1:12:06] the kingdom of God unless you're born
[1:12:08] again. So the eyes of your understanding
[1:12:11] can only be opened up by the new birth.
[1:12:16] Again, it goes goes forward to verse
[1:12:19] five. Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
[1:12:21] except a man be born of water and of the
[1:12:23] spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
[1:12:26] of God.
[1:12:28] That which is born of the flesh is
[1:12:29] flesh. That which is born of the spirit
[1:12:32] is spirit.
[1:12:34] Marvel not that I said unto you, you
[1:12:35] must be born again. The wind bloweth,
[1:12:39] where it listeth, and thou hearest the
[1:12:40] sound thereof, but can't not tell whence
[1:12:44] it cometh, and wheither it goeth. So is
[1:12:46] everyone that is born of the spirit.
[1:12:49] It's not by our own will.
[1:12:51] It's not by our own choosing that we're
[1:12:54] born again. The spirit goes exactly
[1:12:57] where he wills to go.
[1:12:59] That's the one who's been been born
[1:13:01] again. Says been born not of the flesh,
[1:13:05] neither by the will of man, but of God.
[1:13:09] It's not by our own will. It's not by
[1:13:11] our own purpose. It's him quickening us
[1:13:13] to life in that word. In Christ is the
[1:13:16] mystery of God revealed. Brother
[1:13:17] Brandham says, "What is the new birth
[1:13:19] then?" You'd say, "Well, brother
[1:13:19] Brandham, what is the new birth?" It's
[1:13:22] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:13:24] personally to you. Amen. See, not you
[1:13:27] joined a church, you shook a hand, you
[1:13:28] done something different, you said a
[1:13:30] creed, you promised to live by a code of
[1:13:32] rules, but Christ, the Bible, he is the
[1:13:36] word that is revealed to you. And no
[1:13:38] matter what anybody says, what takes
[1:13:40] place, it's Christ, pastor, priest,
[1:13:42] whatever it might be, it's Christ in
[1:13:44] you. That is the revelation that the
[1:13:47] church was built upon. Amen.
[1:13:52] Amen. In Peter's day, in Matthew 16, the
[1:13:56] revelation was, "Who is this man?"
[1:13:59] Whom do men say, "I, the son of man?"
[1:14:01] They have all kinds of answers. Who do
[1:14:03] you say that I am? You're the Christ,
[1:14:05] the son of the living God. What happens
[1:14:08] when that man goes off the scene?
[1:14:12] What What happens when he ascends to
[1:14:14] heaven?
[1:14:16] Right?
[1:14:18] What What's going on on earth?
[1:14:20] who becomes his spokesman? Who's he
[1:14:23] speaking through? Oh, I don't like
[1:14:25] Peter.
[1:14:27] In fact, I don't even like any of those
[1:14:28] people up in the upper room.
[1:14:32] I believe in Jesus and I don't need any
[1:14:34] of them. Okay, there's many like that in
[1:14:37] today. I believe in Jesus and I love
[1:14:40] Jesus.
[1:14:42] Who is Jesus? Where is he? How is he
[1:14:46] revealed? The fact is people don't have
[1:14:50] any understanding of even what the
[1:14:51] gospel is.
[1:14:53] They don't understand even their own
[1:14:55] sinfulness.
[1:14:58] When you miss all of these things, how
[1:15:00] can you It's God has to come to us and
[1:15:02] reveal himself to us. That's how it
[1:15:05] works. It was in book of Revelation
[1:15:07] chapter 10. It wasn't us going up to
[1:15:09] heaven. It was him coming down to us to
[1:15:12] reveal us to him. We weren't even
[1:15:14] looking for a seventh angel messenger.
[1:15:17] We didn't even know that there were
[1:15:18] seven church ages.
[1:15:23] We didn't know and certainly didn't know
[1:15:25] there were seven messengers. And none of
[1:15:26] those messengers even knew that they
[1:15:28] were messengers.
[1:15:31] It took God revealing it to a prophet
[1:15:33] who was vindicated.
[1:15:36] We weren't looking for him. God went
[1:15:38] looking for us.
[1:15:43] 1 John 5:1 says, "Whosoever believeth
[1:15:45] that Jesus is the Christ is born of God,
[1:15:48] and everyone that loveth him that begat
[1:15:50] loveth him also that is begotten of
[1:15:53] him." Amen. What is it? It's the
[1:15:56] revelation.
[1:15:58] When the word is revealed to you, not
[1:16:00] from another age, not from a long ago,
[1:16:03] we comfort ourselves because we I I
[1:16:05] believe just like the Baptists, and the
[1:16:07] Baptists are the best one.
[1:16:10] And I believe like the Pentecostals.
[1:16:12] That's fantastic.
[1:16:13] But do you know him? Do you know the one
[1:16:16] that's revealing himself present tense?
[1:16:18] Because God was moving in a revival
[1:16:20] amongst the Pentecostals. What is he
[1:16:22] doing now? Gathering money. Apparently,
[1:16:26] that's all that they want to do. You
[1:16:28] know, you you got the uh President
[1:16:31] Trump's spiritual adviser is some wicked
[1:16:34] prostitute woman,
[1:16:37] absolutely evil, and she's on there. If
[1:16:39] you pay $1,000 into our our ministry,
[1:16:41] God is going to give you the desire of
[1:16:43] your heart. We're looking for 500 people
[1:16:46] to pay $1,000. This is their this is the
[1:16:49] extent of the Pentecostals. Brother
[1:16:51] Brandham said they they if if we'd last
[1:16:53] another 50 years, they'd be worse off
[1:16:55] than the Catholics. We've reached it.
[1:16:59] They are worse off than the Catholics.
[1:17:00] They're more wicked, more evil.
[1:17:04] Where are we taking the people to? What
[1:17:07] shall we do with this Jesus which is
[1:17:10] called Christ? Not what what should we
[1:17:13] have done with the Jesus that was called
[1:17:15] Christ back there? What should we do
[1:17:17] with this Jesus who is now called Christ
[1:17:21] who's here who's revealing himself who's
[1:17:23] come down?
[1:17:26] His presence is here. The revealing of
[1:17:28] the son of man. They look for it. You
[1:17:31] say, "I don't think that's what it is."
[1:17:32] You don't have a think into it.
[1:17:35] It's how God has revealed himself in
[1:17:37] this hour. That's not my interpretation.
[1:17:40] It's not my interpretation either. I had
[1:17:42] a really different one before I met a
[1:17:44] prophet.
[1:17:47] It's how God interprets himself to us.
[1:17:51] Amen. And it's receiving the Holy Spirit
[1:17:53] that is what actually quickens us to
[1:17:56] life. Opens our eyes to this reality.
[1:18:00] These things are always connected
[1:18:01] together. Receive the word for you. How
[1:18:03] do you how do I know I have the Holy
[1:18:04] Ghost? I've received the word for the
[1:18:06] age.
[1:18:08] Amen.
[1:18:09] And what results is that producing?
[1:18:11] Again, people say, uh, the the initial
[1:18:15] evidence there's, search the Bible and
[1:18:18] try to find an initial evidence of the
[1:18:21] Holy Ghost.
[1:18:22] There's no such thing. And brother
[1:18:24] Brandham is trying to point us to it's
[1:18:26] receiving the word. But it's not just
[1:18:29] it's not just
[1:18:31] believing. It's having the experience. A
[1:18:33] person can say that they believe without
[1:18:36] having the true experience. Thank you.
[1:18:40] Person can confess that they believe
[1:18:43] without truly being regenerated.
[1:18:47] You know, we we each have to be
[1:18:49] converted. We It's not an easy belieism.
[1:18:54] Just make your confession, shake the
[1:18:56] hand of the preacher. No, it's a
[1:18:59] spiritual revelation into your heart
[1:19:01] that brings something, right? Every time
[1:19:05] you read Christ is the mystery of God
[1:19:06] revealed and he talks about the new
[1:19:08] birth and talks about what God is doing.
[1:19:09] He says, "Here's the new birth. It's the
[1:19:11] revelation of Jesus Christ." But then
[1:19:13] what does he say next? And it produces a
[1:19:15] life
[1:19:17] inside of you. Amen.
[1:19:21] And who do you say this is? Brother
[1:19:23] Brandham says, "There is there any here
[1:19:26] that hasn't received the baptism of the
[1:19:27] spirit yet?" Now you say, "Brother
[1:19:29] Brandham, I tell you, I shouted one
[1:19:31] time." That's very good. I spoke in
[1:19:33] tongues once. That's very good, too.
[1:19:37] But still, that ain't what I'm talking
[1:19:38] about. How can you shout and speak in
[1:19:41] tongues and deny the word?
[1:19:46] The evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:48] believing his word. Always been every
[1:19:51] age. If you can receive the word
[1:19:55] and every Christian says, "Amen. I
[1:19:58] believe the Bible from from front to
[1:20:00] from from cover to cover." Fantastic.
[1:20:04] But what is the revelation of that?
[1:20:08] What is he doing today? What word has
[1:20:11] been allotted for this hour?
[1:20:15] It's good to say that you believe every
[1:20:16] word. I know that the Pharisees also
[1:20:18] believed every word.
[1:20:20] All the Jewish people of that time that
[1:20:22] crucified Christ says they believe every
[1:20:24] word. They still say they believe every
[1:20:26] word. They read Isaiah 53
[1:20:30] and they say that's the nation of
[1:20:31] Israel.
[1:20:34] Well, the revelation came forth in in
[1:20:38] the New Testament. The New Testament is
[1:20:40] the opening of the Old Testament. It was
[1:20:43] hidden to them. It actually was even
[1:20:46] hidden to the uh fully wasn't even fully
[1:20:48] revealed to the disciples until the
[1:20:50] Apostle Paul came. Once the Apostle Paul
[1:20:53] came, the full revelation of the Old
[1:20:55] Testament was made known. They didn't
[1:20:57] like what the Apostle Paul had to say.
[1:20:59] Even those that professed to be
[1:21:01] followers of of Jesus Christ. Many of
[1:21:04] them that were Jewish followers of
[1:21:06] Christ, they what did they do? They
[1:21:08] followed around Paul and tried to say,
[1:21:10] "You got to become a Jew first. Got to
[1:21:12] get circumcised. You got to follow the
[1:21:13] law.
[1:21:16] It's about receiving the word in your
[1:21:19] age. Amen.
[1:21:22] John 14:26. But the comforter, which is
[1:21:25] the Holy Ghost, whom the father will
[1:21:26] send in my name, he shall teach you all
[1:21:29] things and bring all things to your
[1:21:32] remembrance whatsoever I have said to
[1:21:35] you. So here is the teacher. The Holy
[1:21:38] Ghost is going to come into you. This
[1:21:40] hearkens back to the new covenant
[1:21:42] promise in Jeremiah.
[1:21:45] What is the new covenant promise? If you
[1:21:47] don't if if your if your mind is going
[1:21:49] blank and wondering what it is, read
[1:21:51] Jeremiah 31 and then read Hebrews
[1:21:54] chapter 10.
[1:21:56] What is it? He's taking the word and
[1:21:58] he's writing it in our hearts, in our
[1:21:59] minds. And it's not that every man will
[1:22:03] teach his neighbor, but they will all
[1:22:04] know me from the least to the greatest.
[1:22:08] And so it's the Holy Ghost coming into
[1:22:10] you and revealing to you who God is.
[1:22:16] John 16:13, "When how be it when he, the
[1:22:18] Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide
[1:22:20] you into all truth, for she shall not
[1:22:22] speak of himself, but whosoever he shall
[1:22:25] hear, that shall he speak, and he will
[1:22:27] show you things to come." So when you
[1:22:30] have the Holy Ghost, that's the teacher.
[1:22:32] That's the one that's going to guide you
[1:22:35] into all truth. Right? I have a strange
[1:22:38] story to tell you. Everybody listens to
[1:22:41] this my testimony and thinks, "What in
[1:22:43] the world is he talking about?" When
[1:22:45] when I was going to college,
[1:22:47] uh I I chose the Lord made me choose a
[1:22:50] Baptist college, which caused me to meet
[1:22:53] a group of friends who who led me to the
[1:22:56] Lord. And I had I had supernatural
[1:22:59] experience. They they were they were
[1:23:01] Presbyterians and Calvinists, but God
[1:23:04] was dealing with me and my whole nature
[1:23:08] was changed.
[1:23:10] And uh everyone that came across me,
[1:23:12] they they knew me before I was changed
[1:23:14] and they instantaneously within about
[1:23:16] two sentences of me speaking would say,
[1:23:18] "Whoa, you're different. What happened?"
[1:23:21] Because I couldn't speak without
[1:23:23] swearing.
[1:23:25] I cursed about every other sentence if I
[1:23:28] wasn't around my parents or a teacher.
[1:23:32] And
[1:23:34] the people that especially the people
[1:23:36] that stayed in my in my dorm, they knew
[1:23:38] what kind of rap music I listened to and
[1:23:40] what kind of things I was into because
[1:23:42] I'd never shut up about it. And then the
[1:23:45] Lord just completely changed my nature.
[1:23:49] And you know, I've had people say, "You
[1:23:51] didn't receive the Holy Ghost." Then I I
[1:23:54] did receive the Holy Ghost then cuz I
[1:23:56] was totally changed cuz guess where the
[1:23:58] Holy Ghost led me to
[1:24:01] a friend of a friend. Hey, let's go
[1:24:04] straighten this guy out on his doctrine.
[1:24:06] He's got some false doctrines about
[1:24:08] Godhead and this William Brandham guy
[1:24:12] said, "Sounds good. Let's straighten him
[1:24:14] out."
[1:24:15] So he went to talk to him and he started
[1:24:18] telling a sto he he was a artist and he
[1:24:21] started illustrating the seed is not air
[1:24:23] with the shuck and explaining this is
[1:24:25] God's purpose of the of the reformation
[1:24:28] and I was hooked. He gave me a tape that
[1:24:31] was the end. Why? Because the he the
[1:24:33] spirit of truth has come. He will guide
[1:24:35] you into all truth.
[1:24:38] Amen. This is a life process. This isn't
[1:24:41] an instantaneous event. Yes. The
[1:24:43] instantane in instantaneous event
[1:24:46] changed me. But did I know the whole
[1:24:49] truth? No. Do I know the whole truth
[1:24:50] now? No.
[1:24:54] But God is guiding me into that and he's
[1:24:56] dealing with me and he's correcting me.
[1:24:58] And I could see the revelation of
[1:24:59] himself in this day. And because of
[1:25:02] that, there's more for me
[1:25:04] and there's more for you. In shalom,
[1:25:07] brother Brandham says, "How would you
[1:25:08] know what's right? The manifestation of
[1:25:11] the spoken word of God being made
[1:25:13] manifest light of the hour. Certainly
[1:25:16] there is what the evidence of the Holy
[1:25:17] Spirit is. Believing the word of God
[1:25:19] when it's manifested. He was the word
[1:25:21] manifested. And some of them denied it,
[1:25:24] laughed at it, made fun of him and
[1:25:26] called him a fortune teller. Some evil
[1:25:28] spirit. There is evidence speaking in
[1:25:30] tongues. There's evidence of the fruits.
[1:25:32] The only evidence there is is when man
[1:25:34] believe the written word when it's
[1:25:36] vindicated. Walk in the light of it.
[1:25:39] Jesus was the light of the hour because
[1:25:41] he was the promised word of the hour and
[1:25:43] tried to tell them so but they were too
[1:25:45] much in darkness to understand it. So is
[1:25:48] it today now? Amen. The word must be
[1:25:53] preached in its fullness. Amen. That is
[1:25:56] where the revelation comes from. That's
[1:25:58] where transformation comes from. That's
[1:26:00] where new life comes from. That's where
[1:26:04] laying in the presence of the sun to
[1:26:05] mature and ripen comes from.
[1:26:08] It isn't in going backwards. It isn't
[1:26:11] trying to search things that aren't what
[1:26:14] are revealed by the message. It's see
[1:26:17] seeing what God is speaking in this
[1:26:19] hour.
[1:26:21] You say, "But what about this situation?
[1:26:23] And what about these churches? And what
[1:26:24] about history? And what about this? What
[1:26:26] about what brother Brandham said? What
[1:26:29] about the scripture teaches?" We don't
[1:26:31] go by our experience. We don't go about
[1:26:33] by this church, by that church, why the
[1:26:35] other one's doing. This is what the word
[1:26:37] says.
[1:26:39] How do I know if I have the Holy Spirit?
[1:26:40] I've received the word of the hour. But
[1:26:43] what? Shut up.
[1:26:47] But I knew a person that Be quiet.
[1:26:52] But I know somebody that fell away. I do
[1:26:54] too.
[1:26:57] That doesn't change the word.
[1:27:01] Broken sisters. turns. Brother Brandham
[1:27:03] says, "But one day the Lord in a vision
[1:27:05] straightened me out, and he said that
[1:27:07] the evidence of the spirit was those who
[1:27:08] could receive the word, neither love nor
[1:27:11] speaking in tongues, but it's receiving
[1:27:13] the word."
[1:27:15] Amen.
[1:27:18] John 6:44 says, "No man can come to me
[1:27:21] except the Father which has sent me,
[1:27:24] draw him, and I will raise him up at the
[1:27:27] last day."
[1:27:30] Amen.
[1:27:34] So
[1:27:35] you can't make the choice yourself
[1:27:39] for Christ.
[1:27:41] I hear that emphasized so often and it
[1:27:44] misses the reality of salvation.
[1:27:48] You didn't choose him
[1:27:52] and he didn't choose you because you
[1:27:54] chose him. That's not what the scripture
[1:27:56] says.
[1:27:58] He said, he says, "You didn't choose me.
[1:28:01] I have chosen you."
[1:28:04] And he tells us what? No man can come to
[1:28:07] me. Let's just let that marinate for a
[1:28:10] second.
[1:28:11] I I I'm glad to quickly skip past that,
[1:28:14] but let's not skip past it too fast. No
[1:28:17] man can come to me. So, you in your own
[1:28:20] will, you in your own power, you by your
[1:28:22] own desire wouldn't come to him.
[1:28:26] Read read Romans 3. Actually, let's read
[1:28:30] Romans 3 verse 9. We'll come back to
[1:28:34] John 6.
[1:28:36] Romans 3:9. What then? Are we better
[1:28:38] than they? No, and no wise. For before
[1:28:41] both proved, both Jews and Gentiles that
[1:28:43] they are all under sin. At as it is
[1:28:45] written, there's none righteous, know
[1:28:47] not one. There is none that
[1:28:48] understandeth. There's none that seeks
[1:28:51] after God. They're all gone out of the
[1:28:53] way. They are together become
[1:28:55] unprofitable. There's none that doeth
[1:28:57] good. No, not one.
[1:29:00] Amen. I'll stop there. There's none that
[1:29:03] seeks after God.
[1:29:05] There's none that understands.
[1:29:08] So, it's not you seeking after God. It's
[1:29:11] God coming to you. It's God coming for
[1:29:15] you. This is so basic to the revelation
[1:29:20] of the open word. If you're if you're
[1:29:22] missing it, go listen to who's this
[1:29:24] Melkisedc and listen to it over and over
[1:29:26] and over and over again because that is
[1:29:29] where the secret of our lives is
[1:29:30] revealed. It isn't your choice. It isn't
[1:29:33] your choosing. It's not God saying,
[1:29:35] "Well, because he chose me, I'll choose
[1:29:37] him." No, he says you I' you haven't
[1:29:41] chosen me, I have chosen you, and no man
[1:29:43] can come to me. But there is an
[1:29:45] exception. Those who the father has
[1:29:48] drawn first. So it's the father drawing
[1:29:51] them. Amen. It's not you making the
[1:29:55] revelation known to yourself, right? For
[1:29:59] by grace are you saved through faith
[1:30:02] that not of yourselves. It's the gift of
[1:30:04] God, not of works, lest any man should
[1:30:06] boast. It's not you personally putting
[1:30:09] faith in Jesus. It's him giving you the
[1:30:13] very gift of faith which we understand
[1:30:16] is a revelation. So you get faith when
[1:30:19] the revelation comes to your heart. You
[1:30:20] can't give it to yourself. It's him
[1:30:22] doing it cuz you don't seek him. You
[1:30:26] your your choices are for sin. Your
[1:30:29] choices are against God. That's that's
[1:30:32] the desire. That's the condition of your
[1:30:35] heart.
[1:30:37] John 6:63 says, "It's the spirit that
[1:30:40] quickens. The flesh profits nothing. The
[1:30:44] words that I speak unto you, they are
[1:30:46] spirit and they are life. So it's the
[1:30:49] spirit that gives life.
[1:30:51] The flesh
[1:30:53] gives no help at all. Or in other words,
[1:30:56] human effort accomplishes nothing. So
[1:30:59] it's not human effort. It's not human
[1:31:01] will. It's not human choice. As the
[1:31:03] scripture says, it's not of him that
[1:31:05] willth or of him that runth, but of God
[1:31:08] that showeth mercy. And so that his
[1:31:11] purpose of what? free will should stand.
[1:31:16] His purpose of election might stand. He
[1:31:20] said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have
[1:31:22] I hated."
[1:31:24] So, it's God's sovereign choosing. You
[1:31:27] didn't choose to quicken yourself. He
[1:31:29] must quicken it. People say, "I'm you're
[1:31:32] swimming in the ocean and uh we're
[1:31:34] throwing a life preserver to you."
[1:31:36] That's not a good picture of salvation.
[1:31:40] The best picture of salvation I've heard
[1:31:42] is you're the you're you're actually you
[1:31:44] already drowned and you're dead laying
[1:31:46] at the bottom of the ocean.
[1:31:49] That's the condition you're in. And
[1:31:51] Christ dives in the water to the bottom
[1:31:53] of the sea, brings you up and breathes
[1:31:55] new life into you. That's what salvation
[1:31:58] is.
[1:32:00] It's not a life ser preserver. It's
[1:32:03] resurrecting a a person that's dead in
[1:32:06] sin and iniquities.
[1:32:13] And who is this? Melazedc brother
[1:32:15] Brandham says you remember we were how
[1:32:16] we read the scriptures. Not him that
[1:32:18] willth or him that runth but God. And
[1:32:21] that his predestination might stand
[1:32:22] true. He could choose before any time.
[1:32:25] God is sovereign in his choosing. Did
[1:32:26] you know that God is sovereign? Who is
[1:32:28] back there to tell him a better way to
[1:32:30] make the world? Who would dare to tell
[1:32:32] him he was running his business wrong?
[1:32:34] Even the very word itself is very
[1:32:36] sovereign. Even the revelation is
[1:32:38] sovereign. He reveals to whom he will
[1:32:40] reveal. The very revelation itself is
[1:32:43] sovereign in God. And that's how people
[1:32:44] pound at things and jump at things and
[1:32:46] hit at things not knowing what they're
[1:32:48] doing. God is sovereign in his works. So
[1:32:52] God's choosing is not based on anything
[1:32:54] we've done.
[1:32:56] It's not our choice.
[1:32:59] It's his sovereign purpose before the
[1:33:00] foundation of the world. Amen.
[1:33:04] He counseledled with his own self. He
[1:33:06] chose us in Christ before the foundation
[1:33:08] of the world. He placed our names on the
[1:33:11] book of life when before the foundation
[1:33:13] of the world.
[1:33:15] And then by his sovereign grace and
[1:33:17] plan, he calls us, right? He calls us.
[1:33:21] He draws us unto Christ. He He quickens
[1:33:24] us to life. The fact is he's already
[1:33:28] justified us on the cross. It's already
[1:33:31] finished. Our sins have already before
[1:33:33] we ever ever lived to commit them. He
[1:33:36] already nailed them to the cross and was
[1:33:38] killed for them. For us,
[1:33:42] we receive that finished work. How?
[1:33:45] By working ourselves into it. No, by
[1:33:47] revelation which is given to us as a
[1:33:49] gift of God.
[1:33:52] God placed his love upon each of us when
[1:33:57] at the last revival
[1:34:01] for all of eternity. Actually,
[1:34:04] there was never a time that God didn't
[1:34:06] love you. There was never a time that
[1:34:10] his grace was not upon you.
[1:34:13] He He literally loved you before the
[1:34:15] foundation of the world. Not just a
[1:34:17] thought, a part of his life, right?
[1:34:20] God's thoughts are real. You were a part
[1:34:22] of him. You're a part of his life. God
[1:34:25] doesn't just love something that doesn't
[1:34:27] exist, but he loves that which is a part
[1:34:30] of himself.
[1:34:33] Amen. And why did he do it?
[1:34:37] For the good pleasure of his own will.
[1:34:39] The scripture says his own good
[1:34:42] pleasure. Nothing you were worthy of.
[1:34:45] Not your choice. Because he chose to do
[1:34:47] it. Just like he said to Israel, he told
[1:34:50] Israel, "Don't think because you're a
[1:34:51] great nation, great and mighty nation, I
[1:34:54] chose you. You're you're the littlest of
[1:34:55] all of them."
[1:34:58] And so he says, "Why did I choose to put
[1:35:00] my love on you?" because I chose to put
[1:35:02] my love on you.
[1:35:06] Which is exactly what Paul teaches in
[1:35:07] Ephesians 1. He did it for the good
[1:35:10] pleasure of the purpose of his grace.
[1:35:15] Ephesians 2. Musicians, if you'd come,
[1:35:18] Brother Tony.
[1:35:22] And you hath he quickened who are dead
[1:35:24] in trespasses and sins. I love this
[1:35:28] because if you understand what
[1:35:29] quickening means, quickening means that
[1:35:32] there was actually a life that there was
[1:35:34] originally, right? So before the
[1:35:37] foundation of the world, you were in
[1:35:39] him. You're a part of his life, right?
[1:35:41] And in Adam that died. So what did it
[1:35:45] take? It took God quickening you to
[1:35:49] life. Why did he have to quicken us?
[1:35:51] Because we were dead in trespasses and
[1:35:53] sins. We weren't searching for a life
[1:35:56] preserver. We were dead and he came to
[1:35:59] us.
[1:36:01] Amen. Wherein we time passed, you walked
[1:36:04] according to the course of this world,
[1:36:06] according to the prince of the power of
[1:36:07] the air, the spirit that now works in
[1:36:10] the children of disobedience, among whom
[1:36:13] also we had all our conversation in
[1:36:15] times past in the lust of our flesh,
[1:36:17] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:36:19] of the mind, and were by nature the
[1:36:21] children of wrath, even as others. It's
[1:36:24] not a good condition.
[1:36:27] We were walking according to the to the
[1:36:30] devil. We were following the ways and
[1:36:33] the deeds of demon powers.
[1:36:36] All right? That's what that's what being
[1:36:38] spiritually dead was. But God who is
[1:36:42] rich in mercy for his great love
[1:36:44] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[1:36:48] dead in sins has quickened us together
[1:36:52] with Christ. By grace are you saved.
[1:36:56] Amen. So that's the quickening power.
[1:36:59] That's what he's quickened to us to in
[1:37:02] this day. Remember, there's a salvation
[1:37:05] ready to be revealed in the last time.
[1:37:08] We must be quickened to that. It's not a
[1:37:11] salva. It's not something that we work
[1:37:12] ourselves into. It's not something that
[1:37:15] we choose ourself. He has sought us out
[1:37:18] to reveal himself to us in this day.
[1:37:22] He's not going to lose one of those
[1:37:24] people whose names were written on the
[1:37:26] lamb's book of life before the
[1:37:27] foundation of the world. He's going to
[1:37:29] be sure to do what? Send a preacher.
[1:37:33] Amen. That's that's God's purpose
[1:37:36] through the five-fold ministry through
[1:37:38] the body of Christ. What is the bride?
[1:37:43] The final voice to the final age under
[1:37:47] their messenger.
[1:37:49] So, having eaten the book, having taken
[1:37:52] the book, having eaten the book, then we
[1:37:54] become the final voice to the final age.
[1:37:57] Thou must prophesy again. We don't
[1:37:58] prophesy our own prophecy, but we take
[1:38:01] that which has been revealed to us from
[1:38:03] the open book and we speak it again. And
[1:38:07] we can go to places like Egypt where
[1:38:09] there's like two believers
[1:38:12] and we can preach the word with
[1:38:13] confidence knowing if he sent us there,
[1:38:16] there's seed there that need to be
[1:38:18] quickened to life or wherever you might
[1:38:20] go. If God has sent you, there's a
[1:38:23] purpose because his word never returns
[1:38:25] to him void. but it accomplishes the
[1:38:28] purpose for which it's sent. The same
[1:38:30] for this day when he's revealed the
[1:38:32] message to you, there's a purpose.
[1:38:35] There's a purpose in it. He He He
[1:38:37] intends to get something out of you. He
[1:38:40] can't He He intends to accomplish
[1:38:43] something through you. He He not only
[1:38:45] intends to get you ready for the
[1:38:48] rapture, but he wants you to be a
[1:38:49] manifestation of that life so that
[1:38:52] others can see and say, "There's
[1:38:54] something peculiar here.
[1:38:56] There's something different.
[1:38:58] Amen. And by that, maybe by your life
[1:39:03] manifesting Christ, maybe someone will
[1:39:06] come and say, "I need to feed on that
[1:39:08] same unfailing body word of the son of
[1:39:11] man." Amen. We got we we got nothing to
[1:39:15] be ashamed of. Amen. Paul said, "I'm not
[1:39:18] ashamed of the gospel of Christ." If you
[1:39:21] think about that, I'm not ashamed of the
[1:39:24] open word in this hour.
[1:39:27] For what is it? It's the power of God
[1:39:30] unto salvation unto all that believe.
[1:39:34] Amen. He He quickens you to that. He He
[1:39:37] gives you faith. Amen. I want you to be
[1:39:40] encouraged.
[1:39:43] I don't want you to I don't want you to
[1:39:44] leave this place thinking, my I don't
[1:39:46] have something. Look, if you believe the
[1:39:49] word,
[1:39:51] keep feeding on that word. You say, "But
[1:39:53] I'm not sure if I have the life,
[1:39:56] keep feeding on the word. The quickening
[1:39:58] power will come."
[1:40:01] We can pray for you. We can lay hands on
[1:40:03] you, but it's God that has to convert
[1:40:06] you, to give you a new nature that you
[1:40:09] delight in the word.
[1:40:11] Amen. His grace is drawing you. Say,
[1:40:15] "Amen.
[1:40:17] Amen. Amen. Abraham believed God and it
[1:40:20] was counted to him to righteousness. We
[1:40:22] Abraham had a crazy message.
[1:40:26] It was different than any other message
[1:40:28] because he had no children and he was
[1:40:31] told you're going to be the father of
[1:40:32] many nations. Amen. And you look at you
[1:40:36] look at us and you say, "My strange
[1:40:38] group of people, small church by there,
[1:40:40] the preaching is different." Do you do
[1:40:43] you have the revelation of the word in
[1:40:44] your heart? Because one day you're going
[1:40:47] to take a body change.
[1:40:49] That very word that you're feeding on is
[1:40:52] in itself is going to change your body.
[1:40:55] And let's stand.
[1:41:01] Heavenly Father,
[1:41:03] I just think of the scripture
[1:41:07] in the Gospel of John.
[1:41:09] [Music]
[1:41:11] But as many as received him,
[1:41:14] to them gave he power to become the sons
[1:41:18] of God. Even to them that believe on his
[1:41:22] name. Lord,
[1:41:25] we we accept
[1:41:28] that white-wiged one that's come down,
[1:41:31] the supreme judge. We receive you, Lord.
[1:41:34] We believe it. And we believe from that
[1:41:37] we receive power to become sons of God.
[1:41:40] Lord, receiving
[1:41:43] the full revelation of all that Calvary
[1:41:45] was meant to produce in us in a people
[1:41:48] on the earth.
[1:41:51] It's Christ in the form of his bride. We
[1:41:54] thank you for that, Lord. We pray that
[1:41:57] the revelation would break forth upon
[1:41:58] every heart and every mind and every
[1:42:01] life.
[1:42:02] that we would be changed and shaped into
[1:42:04] that very image. Lord,
[1:42:08] we commit commit the word to you, Lord.
[1:42:11] We know that it will not return to you
[1:42:12] void, but it will accomplish what you've
[1:42:15] sent it for. We ask it in Jesus name.
[1:42:18] Amen. Let's worship him.
[1:42:21] You deserve the glory.
[1:42:24] Hallelujah.
[1:42:26] and the honor.
[1:42:30] Lord, we lift our hands in worship
[1:42:35] as we praise your holy name. You deserve
[1:42:40] the glory
[1:42:44] and the honor.
[1:42:48] Lord, we lift our hands in worship
[1:42:53] as we praise your holy name. You are
[1:42:58] great.
[1:43:00] You do miracles
[1:43:02] so great.

[1:43:15] are grace.
[1:43:17] You do miracles so great.
[1:43:22] There is no one else like you.
[1:43:28] There is no one else like
[1:43:32] like you.
[1:43:36] You deserve the gloryy
[1:43:41] and the honor.
[1:43:45] Lord, we lift our hands in worship as we

[1:44:11] great.
[1:44:13] You do miracles so great.
[1:44:17] There is no one else like you.
[1:44:22] [Music]
[1:44:23] There is no one else like you. For you
[1:44:28] are great.
[1:44:30] You do miracles so great.
[1:44:34] There is no one else like you.
[1:44:40] There is no one else like you. For you
[1:44:44] are great.
[1:44:46] You do miracles so great.
[1:44:51] There is no one else like you.
[1:44:56] There is no
[1:44:59] one else
[1:45:01] like you.
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:06] Just want to leave you with this quote
[1:45:08] from communion. Brother Brandham says I
[1:45:10] was saying this taking my for myself
[1:45:14] like he was going to say William
[1:45:15] Brandham. Well 40 years ago the William
[1:45:17] Brham isn't the same one tonight.
[1:45:20] Somebody back there would say William
[1:45:22] Brandham he was a rank rascal. See
[1:45:23] because I was born of Charles and Ella
[1:45:25] Brandom in their nature. I was a sinner.
[1:45:28] I came to the world a liar. All the
[1:45:30] habits of the world lay right in me. But
[1:45:33] down in there too was another nature
[1:45:35] present. See predestinated was in there
[1:45:38] by God in this same body. Two natures in
[1:45:41] there. He said down in there was a speck
[1:45:45] of eternal life. A little spot. There
[1:45:48] was another William Brandom. A little
[1:45:49] spot of eternal life down there from the
[1:45:51] genes of God. The word of God was placed
[1:45:54] in there. And that little life was
[1:45:57] laying there. the life of water, the
[1:46:00] washing of water of the word was poured
[1:46:02] upon it. Then it be to grow. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:06] Heavenly Father, we pray as we're
[1:46:09] dismissed, Lord, that your Holy Spirit
[1:46:10] would go with each one. Lord, we pray
[1:46:12] for the healing touch for those who are
[1:46:15] sick and afflicted. Lord, we pray for a
[1:46:18] filling of the Holy Spirit who those who
[1:46:20] need more of you. Lord, we ask your hand
[1:46:22] would be upon each one. Father, we
[1:46:24] commit them to you for your glory in
[1:46:26] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:39] So great.
[1:46:42] No one else like you.
[1:46:47] There is no one else like you. For you
[1:46:52] are great.
[1:46:54] You do miracles so great.
[1:46:58] There is no one else like you.
[1:47:04] There is no one else
[1:47:08] like you.
[1:47:12] You deserve the gloryy
[1:47:16] and the honor.
[1:47:21] Lord, we lift our hands in worship as we
[1:47:26] praise your holy name. You deserve the
[1:47:30] glory
[1:47:33] and the honor,
[1:47:38] Lord. We lift our hands in worship as we
[1:47:43] praise your holy name. You are great.
[1:47:49] to do miracles so great.
[1:47:53] There is no one else like you.
[1:47:58] There is no one else like you. For you
[1:48:03] are great.
[1:48:05] You do miracles so great. There is no
[1:48:10] one else like you.
[1:48:15] There is no one else like you.
[1:48:19] For you are great.
[1:48:21] You do miracles so great. There is no
[1:48:27] one else like you.
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:31] There is no one else
[1:48:36] like you.
[1:48:38] [Music]
[1:48:45] [Applause]
[1:48:45] [Music]
[1:48:55] You deserve the glory
[1:48:59] and the honor.
[1:49:03] Lord, we lift our hands in worship
[1:49:08] as we praise your holy name. You deserve
[1:49:12] the gloryy
[1:49:16] and the honor.
[1:49:20] Lord, we lift our hands in worship as we
[1:49:25] praise your holy name. For you are
[1:49:30] grace. You do miracles so great.
[1:49:35] There is no one else like you.
[1:49:40] [Music]
[1:49:41] There is no one else like you. For you
[1:49:46] are great. You do miracles so great.
