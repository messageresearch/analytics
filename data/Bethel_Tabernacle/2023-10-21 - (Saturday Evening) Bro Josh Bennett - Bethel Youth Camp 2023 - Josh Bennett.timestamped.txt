[52:23] our hearts but how many would just like
[52:25] for the Lord to speak tonight and amen I
[52:29] I I believe that one word from him would
[52:31] make all the difference so amen let's
[52:33] just bow our hearts together and look to
[52:35] him now you pray amen let's just ask God
[52:38] to come Among Us Lord Jesus Lord we just
[52:40] thank you for this privilege and
[52:43] opportunity to come and gather with your
[52:45] children and Lord I look across this
[52:47] audience and I see Believers and Lord I
[52:50] I look at the young people Lord and and
[52:53] Lord I I see that there a they're a
[52:55] product of the message that You' have
[52:58] sent to us in this this this end time
[53:01] and Lord we're so thankful God that we
[53:05] we know Lord that your word can never
[53:07] return unto your Void but it has to
[53:09] accomplish the thing that you sent it to
[53:11] do and Lord I believe that you sent this
[53:14] message to us to to give a bride
[53:17] rapturing faith and rapturing Grace in
[53:19] this hour and Lord a message to turn our
[53:22] hearts back and Lord we're so thankful
[53:25] God that Lord I'm looking at at some
[53:27] people that are the they have received
[53:30] that message and Lord as they have
[53:32] received that message they have received
[53:34] the benefits of that message and so God
[53:37] we're just asking tonight that you would
[53:40] just come now and Lord we're
[53:41] surrendering our hearts to you we're
[53:43] giving our Lord the the gift that we
[53:46] have Lord we just Lord we know it's your
[53:48] gift and and Lord there's nothing
[53:50] special about us and so God we're we're
[53:53] realizing that tonight and we're very
[53:55] conscious of our of our littleness and
[53:58] so God we just ask Lord that as we
[54:00] humble oursel in your presence that you
[54:02] would just come and Lord that you would
[54:04] begin to speak and you would begin to
[54:06] minister Lord because Lord that would
[54:09] make all the difference here tonight and
[54:10] Lord I pray that Lord that you would
[54:13] just begin to walk up and down the
[54:14] Avenues of the hearts and Lord discern
[54:17] the needs that Lord we don't know what
[54:19] the needs may be but you know all things
[54:21] you're the omniscient God and so God
[54:23] we're just asking that you just come in
[54:25] a special way now Lord speak to your
[54:28] children through your word and Lord
[54:30] we'll give you all the thanks and all
[54:31] the praise for we ask it in Jesus
[54:33] precious name amen amen amen amen I
[54:38] don't know um I'm going to try my best
[54:41] to not use that because it's kind of
[54:43] cutting out but amen if you can keep
[54:46] that where it's at right now that'll be
[54:48] just fine and so uh we we do greet you
[54:51] in the name of the Lord tonight how many
[54:52] has enjoyed the services so far amen we
[54:55] appreciate our brother
[54:57] Andrew and
[55:00] um I tell you I'm glad that uh that God
[55:04] still got some men that he can put his
[55:06] hands on and that'll preach the word
[55:08] with you know the way that the I I
[55:11] believe that that God sent us a message
[55:13] and it don't need to be dressed up and
[55:15] prettied up and amen you're the
[55:17] generation amen I'll just ask you
[55:19] tonight as a as as this this fresh
[55:23] generation amen do you want a watered
[55:25] down version of the message of the hour
[55:28] amen do you want something do you want
[55:29] something that's you know watered down
[55:31] and fixed up and amen or do you just
[55:33] want it the way God said it amen how
[55:36] many would say that I just want it the
[55:38] way God said it the way that God sent it
[55:40] that's good enough for me and I believe
[55:42] that's what we've heard preached here
[55:43] the last couple nights and so we
[55:45] certainly appreciate the word of God if
[55:47] you have your Bible we'll just turn to
[55:49] the book of Acts in the 20th chapter I
[55:51] know I don't have to tell you that I'm a
[55:53] little bit nervous but uh I'm a nervous
[55:56] person I'm always nervous and so when I
[55:58] get behind the pull pit I'm ex extremely
[56:01] nervous and uh but you know as I said we
[56:05] um we just count it such a an honor to
[56:08] be here we appreciate brother Jason
[56:10] brother Matt and all the ministry here
[56:12] for giving us this opportunity tonight
[56:14] Acts chapter 20 and verse
[56:16] 18 and I also want to read from one
[56:18] place and uh 1 Corinthians the 15th
[56:23] chapter we'll start here in Acts chap 20
[56:26] and the 18th
[56:27] verse and when they were come to him he
[56:30] said unto them you know from the first
[56:32] day that I came to Asia after what
[56:35] Manner I have been with you at all
[56:36] seasons serving the Lord with all
[56:39] humility of mine with many tears and
[56:43] temptations which befel me by the laying
[56:47] in weight of the Jews and how I kept
[56:50] back nothing that was profitable unto
[56:52] you but have showed you and have have
[56:55] taught you publicly from and from house
[56:57] to house testifying both to the Jews and
[57:01] also to the Greeks repentance toward God
[57:03] and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ
[57:07] and now behold I go Bound in the spirit
[57:09] unto Jerusalem not knowing the things
[57:12] that shall befall me there save that the
[57:14] Holy Ghost witnessed in every city
[57:16] saying that bonds and afflictions abide
[57:19] me but none of these things move me
[57:22] neither count I my life dear unto myself
[57:25] so that I might finish my course with
[57:27] joy and the ministry which I have
[57:30] received of the Lord Jesus to testify
[57:34] the gospel of the grace of God 1
[57:38] Corinthians 15 and verse
[57:48] 58 yeah the Apostle Paul writing here
[57:53] which
[57:55] is the same one that we were reading
[57:57] about in Acts
[57:58] 20 1 Corinthians 15 and 58 and he writes
[58:02] therefore my beloved Brethren be
[58:05] steadfast
[58:06] unmovable always abounding in the work
[58:09] of the Lord for as much as you know that
[58:12] your labor is not in vain in the Lord
[58:16] may God add His blessings as you're
[58:18] seated
[58:20] tonight get rid of this if I
[58:23] can thank you brother
[58:25] I want to speak to you for the next few
[58:27] minutes by the help of God I want to
[58:30] thank Daniel Cross for this beautiful
[58:31] pull pit that I can't fit all my notes
[58:34] on so thank you brother he probably did
[58:37] that hoping that it would help uh
[58:39] shorten the service but amen but you
[58:42] know we're we're just going to amen how
[58:44] many wants the Holy Spirit to have his
[58:46] way tonight amen I want to speak to you
[58:49] just for the next few minutes on uh out
[58:51] of Acts 20 there in the 24th verse where
[58:54] Paul says but none of these things move
[58:57] me none of these things move me in the
[59:00] Book of Psalms in the 16th chapter in
[59:02] the 7th verse David said I Will Bless
[59:04] The Lord who hath given me counsel my
[59:06] Reigns also instruct me in the night
[59:09] season he said I have set the lord
[59:12] always before me because he is at my
[59:14] right hand I shall not be moved amen I
[59:18] have set the Lord before me and because
[59:21] he is at my right hand I shall not be
[59:23] moved that word there in the Hebrew it
[59:26] means to to totter or to shake or to
[59:30] slip or to be shaken or to be moved or
[59:33] to be overthrown so David is saying I
[59:36] have set the Lord before me he said and
[59:39] because he's at my right hand I shall
[59:41] not be shaken I shall not slip I shall
[59:44] not be overthrown amen and so I believe
[59:48] that if if David uh said that uh that
[59:52] there in the Old Testament how many
[59:53] believes that that we can also set the
[59:56] Lord before us amen and I believe that
[59:59] if we set the Lord before us even as
[1:00:02] brother Barry was sharing this morning
[1:00:04] about always being conscious of the Holy
[1:00:06] Spirit and and how that we would walk
[1:00:09] and and we never want to grieve the Holy
[1:00:10] Spirit and see amen I believe that that
[1:00:13] that's so important for us to to put the
[1:00:15] Lord before us at all times amen but
[1:00:18] David said because he is at my right
[1:00:20] hand I shall not be moved or I shall not
[1:00:23] totter or slip or or be shaken now in
[1:00:26] the message the absolute brother B would
[1:00:28] say and what the Christians need today
[1:00:30] is in this atomic age and in this time
[1:00:33] of uncertainty you need something
[1:00:35] besides just an experience of joining
[1:00:37] Church how many can say Amen to that you
[1:00:40] need an anchor see an absolute to know
[1:00:43] because churches will fail and people
[1:00:45] will fail but Christ cannot fail amen
[1:00:49] he's the he's the absolute to the
[1:00:52] believer amen and Christ is your
[1:00:55] absolute you're tied to him and he's
[1:00:57] your absolute and you're tied to him see
[1:00:59] then you're tied to the word he said now
[1:01:02] that this tells whether or not you got
[1:01:04] the right absolute see if you can read
[1:01:06] in the scripture something that Christ
[1:01:09] has ordained or commissioned us to do
[1:01:12] and because of some twisting around or
[1:01:14] someone would tell you that that was for
[1:01:16] the disciples or somebody else and then
[1:01:19] you don't hold on to that see then
[1:01:20] Christ is not your absolute he said amen
[1:01:24] the person who led you out of the way is
[1:01:27] your absolute then so in other words the
[1:01:29] prophet is showing if somebody comes
[1:01:31] along and and Lead You Away from the
[1:01:34] word he said then that person has now
[1:01:36] become your absolute amen because
[1:01:39] anything that's contrary to the word of
[1:01:41] God Amen anything that's leading you
[1:01:44] away from the word of God see amen the
[1:01:46] prophet of God said if the word is your
[1:01:48] absolute amen anything that begins to
[1:01:50] try to lead you away from the word
[1:01:53] you'll hold on to the word
[1:01:55] amen listen if it cost you
[1:01:57] friendships amen if it cost you
[1:01:59] popularity amen it don't matter what you
[1:02:02] cost you amen if you're tied to the and
[1:02:04] the word is your absolute if Christ is
[1:02:06] your absolute amen you will hold to that
[1:02:09] word in spite of everything else is that
[1:02:11] right amen so watch what the prophet
[1:02:13] said if the word Christ still holds
[1:02:16] there then he's your absolute and we
[1:02:18] mustn't let anything stir us out of the
[1:02:21] way of the word amen as he goes on to
[1:02:24] say in in another uh uh in another time
[1:02:27] that he preached the same message same
[1:02:29] sermon he said now when I was looking
[1:02:31] this text up he said I somebody uh keep
[1:02:34] saying you know that's absolute or the
[1:02:37] truth or it's absolute and this is it
[1:02:39] and I thought what is that word what
[1:02:41] does it mean absolute and when I went to
[1:02:43] the dictionary to find out what it meant
[1:02:45] Webster said it's perfect within itself
[1:02:48] it's Unlimited in its power it's
[1:02:50] primarily an ultimate amen so so see if
[1:02:54] is Unlimited in his power is perfect
[1:02:56] within itself now we know that only the
[1:02:58] word of God is perfect within itself how
[1:03:01] many can say Amen to that amen only the
[1:03:04] word so only the word can be our
[1:03:06] absolute now we know that you know
[1:03:08] there's all kind of debates and argument
[1:03:10] well what is the absolute is it is it
[1:03:12] the Bible or is it but listen friends
[1:03:14] I'm going tell you every every every
[1:03:16] denomination out here amen they hold to
[1:03:18] the Bible and they will hold up a Bible
[1:03:20] and they will say this is my absolute
[1:03:22] amen but really and truly in real ity
[1:03:25] amen what is absolute to you is what has
[1:03:27] been revealed to you out of that word
[1:03:30] amen because when the word becomes a
[1:03:32] revelation in your heart then listen
[1:03:34] it's not just something that somebody
[1:03:35] has told you it's not just something
[1:03:37] that somebody has explained to you or
[1:03:40] talked you in or convinced you of but
[1:03:42] when the word becomes an absolute in
[1:03:44] your heart amen it becomes a revelation
[1:03:47] to you personally then now it is an
[1:03:49] absolute to you it's something that your
[1:03:52] Soul Is Anchored to or di to and nothing
[1:03:55] can move you off of that is that right
[1:03:59] amen so the prophet would say he said
[1:04:01] now every great achievement is tied to
[1:04:03] an absolute in the day that we're living
[1:04:05] in now everything is so breaking up and
[1:04:08] so fragile and so carried away he said
[1:04:10] and I think that this message would be
[1:04:12] very appropriate it be a very
[1:04:14] appropriate thing especially to
[1:04:15] Christians when they're going through
[1:04:17] their deep Waters now the Christian
[1:04:20] church is passing through the deepest
[1:04:22] water is had for over the last 2,000
[1:04:25] years because we're coming to a spot to
[1:04:28] where there's something presented to
[1:04:29] Christians something that they're going
[1:04:31] to have to make a decision on and I
[1:04:33] think that the Christian Church ought to
[1:04:35] have something that they know that they
[1:04:37] are tied to instead of just floating
[1:04:40] about like a leaf on the water with the
[1:04:42] wind see the Bible says carried about
[1:04:44] with every wind of Doctrine the
[1:04:46] Christian Life ought to be a stable life
[1:04:50] it should be something that's a
[1:04:51] principal see that you're tied to that
[1:04:54] it's more than life itself and you must
[1:04:57] have something that you're tied to he
[1:05:01] says he goes on to say he says now
[1:05:03] certainly the Catholic Church they would
[1:05:06] take their anchor their Northstar for
[1:05:08] their achievements and and it it is what
[1:05:10] whatever the Pope says see it's an
[1:05:12] infallibility to the Roman Catholic
[1:05:14] Church in the Protestants they have a
[1:05:16] bishop or some Creed and their
[1:05:18] denominational beliefs and so forth amen
[1:05:20] but you know I feel like Paul amen when
[1:05:23] he said here I as I'm looking at the
[1:05:25] scripture in Acts 20 and 24 he said none
[1:05:27] of these things move me he said amen why
[1:05:30] for he was anchored he had an absolute
[1:05:33] he says since I met him out there on the
[1:05:35] road to Damascus amen he had listen
[1:05:37] friends I want to tell you Paul didn't
[1:05:39] meet uh Paul didn't come in contact amen
[1:05:42] with another Doctrine Paul didn't come
[1:05:44] in contact with just a better idea Paul
[1:05:47] met the pillar of fire on the road to
[1:05:49] Damascus like brother Andrew was
[1:05:51] preaching to us last night he met amen
[1:05:53] something in the middle of the road that
[1:05:55] changed his life amen and it turned him
[1:05:58] around Paul was on his way to persecute
[1:06:01] the Christian church is that right amen
[1:06:04] thinking that he was doing God a service
[1:06:06] thinking that he was in the will of God
[1:06:08] Paul was a religious man Paul was a
[1:06:10] well-taught man he set at the feet of
[1:06:12] Gia hey Paul knew scripture amen but
[1:06:15] when he met the pillar of fire amen and
[1:06:17] a voice begin to speak to him out of
[1:06:19] that Pillar of Fire amen that changed
[1:06:22] his life forever and from that that day
[1:06:24] forward Paul had an
[1:06:27] absolute hallelujah amen I tell you what
[1:06:30] friends amen I hope that every person in
[1:06:33] this building comes in contact with the
[1:06:35] same Pillar of Fire that Paul met on
[1:06:37] that road because the prophet of God
[1:06:39] said that five minutes in the presence
[1:06:41] of God Amen F he talked about Moses when
[1:06:44] he met amen when he met God On The Backs
[1:06:47] side of the desert in the form of a
[1:06:48] burning bush he said five minutes in
[1:06:51] God's presence done more for him amen
[1:06:53] than 40 years of training in Egypt amen
[1:06:56] 40 Years of theology amen had failed
[1:07:00] Moses and left him a failure but five
[1:07:02] minutes in the presence of God changed a
[1:07:05] man amen it didn't just change Moses but
[1:07:08] the prophet of God said because one man
[1:07:11] took God at his word amen it didn't just
[1:07:13] change a man it changed the whole world
[1:07:16] at that time because somebody got in the
[1:07:19] presence of
[1:07:22] God hallelujah
[1:07:25] I tell you what it did amen it anchored
[1:07:27] him to an
[1:07:29] absolute it tied him to an absolute now
[1:07:32] the Bible says amen uh in Hebrews
[1:07:36] chapter 6 verse 16 for men verely swear
[1:07:39] by the greater and an oath for
[1:07:42] confirmations is to them an end of all
[1:07:46] Strife where in God willing more
[1:07:50] abundantly to show under Under The Heirs
[1:07:52] of the promise the immutability ility of
[1:07:54] his counsel confirmed it by an oath that
[1:07:58] by two immutable things in which it is
[1:08:01] impossible it is impossible I think this
[1:08:04] is beautiful it is impossible are you
[1:08:06] hearing me tonight it is
[1:08:09] impossible for God to
[1:08:12] lie amen God cannot
[1:08:17] lie hallelujah amen that we might have a
[1:08:21] strong
[1:08:22] consolation who fled for Refuge to lay
[1:08:25] hold o upon the hope that is set before
[1:08:28] us which hope we have is an anchor of
[1:08:31] the Soul both sure and steadfast and
[1:08:34] which entered in with in the veil
[1:08:37] whether the Forerunner is for us entered
[1:08:39] even Jesus made a high priest Forever
[1:08:41] After the order of mezc watch what Paul
[1:08:44] is is writing here is showing us here
[1:08:46] which hope we have for an anchor of What
[1:08:49] Not Our
[1:08:50] flesh the anchor is not our for our
[1:08:53] flesh
[1:08:54] the anchor is not tied to your spirit
[1:08:57] amen listen for you ought to be thankful
[1:08:59] for that tonight cuz there's going to be
[1:09:01] days in your flesh you going to feel
[1:09:02] good and there's going to be days that
[1:09:04] you're not going to feel good you're
[1:09:06] going to have good days you're going to
[1:09:07] have bad days you say brother you
[1:09:09] talking about even somebody born again
[1:09:12] absolutely even born again Believers
[1:09:15] have bad
[1:09:16] days do you realize even Christians get
[1:09:20] sick as a matter of fact the Bible says
[1:09:24] many are the afflictions of the
[1:09:27] righteous so when God saved us and give
[1:09:30] us the Holy Ghost amen that does not
[1:09:33] mean that we're not going to ever go
[1:09:34] through tests and trials and and
[1:09:36] problems and and troubles and amen and
[1:09:39] you're going to have disappointments and
[1:09:41] discouragements and and there's and
[1:09:43] there's going to be times that you're
[1:09:44] not at a youth
[1:09:46] camp and you're not surrounded by a
[1:09:49] bunch of kids that believe what you
[1:09:51] believe and and you're not going to have
[1:09:53] peers amen around you supporting you
[1:09:56] amen you're not always going to live in
[1:09:58] a church
[1:10:00] atmosphere but but you're going to
[1:10:02] you're going to have bad
[1:10:04] days you're going to you're going to
[1:10:06] face disappointments and troubles and
[1:10:08] and
[1:10:10] situations let me I'm not trying to
[1:10:12] paint a real bad picture for you tonight
[1:10:14] but I'm just telling you a as young
[1:10:16] people tonight amen the days that lay
[1:10:18] ahead of you are not all going to be
[1:10:20] beautiful and sunny and and wonderful
[1:10:22] and
[1:10:25] you're going to go through some troubles
[1:10:26] and some problems and amen just like
[1:10:29] Paul amen there in Acts 20 amen listen
[1:10:33] for is from the time he met God on the
[1:10:35] road to Damascus until the time that
[1:10:37] that story was being told in the book of
[1:10:39] Acts he had nothing but
[1:10:43] trouble Paul was beaten and whipped and
[1:10:46] threw in prison
[1:10:49] and even the Christians had a hard time
[1:10:52] trusting him can you blame them
[1:10:54] I mean they struggled for a while to
[1:10:56] accept Paul's Ministry because this is
[1:10:58] the very man that just a few days before
[1:11:00] was persecuting
[1:11:02] them amen Paul amen and the Jews hated
[1:11:05] him though amen because Paul was one a
[1:11:09] great man among them at one time and and
[1:11:12] so it looked like everything had turned
[1:11:14] against Paul but you know what Paul said
[1:11:16] he talked about tears many
[1:11:19] tears he talked about tribulations and
[1:11:22] and all these things but his testimony
[1:11:24] was this none of those things move
[1:11:30] me and he said I don't even know what
[1:11:32] lays in front of me I don't even know
[1:11:34] the things that I may have to suffer I
[1:11:36] don't even know except amen that that
[1:11:38] God has witnessed by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:11:40] that that bonds and imprisonment amen is
[1:11:43] what laying in front of me but do you
[1:11:45] realize amen Paul amen had already
[1:11:47] caught a vision and God had already
[1:11:49] spoke to him that he would go to
[1:11:51] Jerusalem amen and that he would a
[1:11:53] vision eventually end up in Rome and he
[1:11:55] didn't care what it cost him or what he
[1:11:57] had to go through amen Paul amen was
[1:12:00] going to be obedient to the heavenly
[1:12:07] vision and so he said none of these
[1:12:10] things move
[1:12:14] me why because he had his soul was tied
[1:12:17] to something let me tell you your Soul's
[1:12:20] got to be tied to
[1:12:21] something and that anchor got to be
[1:12:23] connected listen I'm glad that it's not
[1:12:26] connected in on this side in my flesh
[1:12:30] or or even in my
[1:12:33] spirit amen because I'm going to tell
[1:12:35] you the flesh is an Emy with the things
[1:12:37] of God that's the that's the
[1:12:39] scripture amen and amen but but that
[1:12:43] Soul amen the prophet of God said that
[1:12:45] Soul amen because he talks about the
[1:12:47] endet of the Flesh and the five senses
[1:12:49] the endet of the spirit and all those
[1:12:52] things Satan uses and works in those
[1:12:55] areas how many knows that's true but in
[1:12:57] the soul it's either Faith or
[1:13:01] doubt amen and it's a beautiful thing
[1:13:03] because amen when when your Soul Is
[1:13:05] Anchored to the word of God Amen it
[1:13:07] don't matter what's going on around
[1:13:11] you amen the prophet would type it with
[1:13:14] a with a Tabernacle in the wilderness he
[1:13:16] said see when they was coming in in into
[1:13:19] the outer courts there amen that was a
[1:13:21] flesh because remember it was in three
[1:13:23] uh categories or or three uh uh uh you
[1:13:26] know there was three uh places there in
[1:13:29] the Tabernacle the outer Court the inner
[1:13:30] Court the holies of holies and the
[1:13:32] probably type that because you're a
[1:13:33] triun and being amen you're made up of a
[1:13:35] of a flesh body and then you got a
[1:13:37] spirit and you got a
[1:13:39] soul and the man that was in the outer
[1:13:42] Court was subject to the
[1:13:44] elments amen there was uh there was
[1:13:47] sunny days and then there was cloudy
[1:13:49] days there was sunny days and there was
[1:13:52] rainy days amen there was all kind of
[1:13:54] amen and and and because he was subject
[1:13:57] to those elements amen then the then the
[1:13:59] the
[1:14:00] weather could actually impact his amen
[1:14:04] his
[1:14:06] experience amen the sunny days and amen
[1:14:09] uh you know when on the sunny days he
[1:14:11] was on the mountain the cloudy days he
[1:14:13] didn't even know if he was a
[1:14:17] Christian that's what that's what it's
[1:14:19] like trying to serve God just in a
[1:14:21] Justified state
[1:14:25] then you move into the inner court now
[1:14:27] you're moving into the
[1:14:28] spirit and and and in that place there's
[1:14:31] a lampstand and and and there's you know
[1:14:34] there's a light of the lampstand which
[1:14:36] is a better Light No Doubt amen but the
[1:14:38] prophet said even that would get Smoky
[1:14:40] at times even that would go out at times
[1:14:44] even that sometimes the smoke would
[1:14:45] would cloud over the amen over the the
[1:14:48] light of the lamps amen and you could
[1:14:50] still amen be impacted amen by but
[1:14:53] listen friends amen there's another
[1:14:55] place it's called the holiest of holies
[1:14:58] Hallelujah which represents the soul
[1:15:01] that's on the inside of you that part
[1:15:04] that come from God hallelujah amen that
[1:15:07] part of you amen that's anchored to
[1:15:12] Eternity Hallelujah and the light that's
[1:15:15] in there amen is a light from the pillar
[1:15:17] of fire itself the very Shan of glory
[1:15:20] and it never goes
[1:15:22] out
[1:15:23] Hallelujah and it's not dependent on any
[1:15:26] man to keep it
[1:15:27] burning Hallelujah so if that's where
[1:15:30] your experiences tonight amen there's
[1:15:33] nothing that can happen around you that
[1:15:35] can impact your experience with
[1:15:41] God hallelujah amen amen if they walk
[1:15:45] away it will not affect you if your
[1:15:48] friends leave the message it will not
[1:15:50] affect you Hallelujah if if the pastor
[1:15:54] fails you'll still stand if the church

[1:16:09] Hallelujah because you got an
[1:16:12] anchor you got a tie poost it's
[1:16:15] connected to your
[1:16:18] soul anchor behind the veil he said the
[1:16:22] prop the Prophet said oh I wish the
[1:16:24] church could see that all the arguments
[1:16:27] and strife would be
[1:16:30] over amen that would be the Supreme
[1:16:33] Court the Northstar Hallelujah the end
[1:16:36] of all Strife it's the end of all
[1:16:41] questions listen friends it's the end of

[1:27:59] around them or what their neighbor
[1:28:01] thinks he said it proves that Jesus
[1:28:04] Christ is still

[1:28:49] got enough of God in their heart to say
[1:28:51] Amen Amen to the word of God your amen

[1:29:02] alive Hallelujah with that in mind why

[1:30:23] still the word of
[1:30:26] God and and everything's falling
[1:30:30] apart and everything will be
[1:30:32] shaken but there's something that will
[1:30:36] remain amen because there's a kingdom
[1:30:39] that cannot be

[1:52:05] minutes listen amen the psalm the
[1:52:08] psalmist writes in Psalms 46 God is our
[1:52:11] refuge and our strength of very present
[1:52:13] help and trouble therefore we will not
[1:52:15] fear though our heart be though or sorry
[1:52:17] though the Earth be removed and though
[1:52:19] the mount be carried into the midst of
[1:52:21] the sea though the waters thereof Roar
[1:52:23] and be troubled though the mountains
[1:52:24] shake with the swelling thereof amen
[1:52:27] there is a
[1:52:28] river Hallelujah whereof shall make glad
[1:52:31] the city of God the holy place of the
[1:52:34] Tabernacles of the most high God is in
[1:52:38] the midst of
[1:52:39] her she shall not be
[1:52:47] moved let me tell you something tonight
[1:52:49] that That's What Makes You
[1:52:51] Different that's what set you apart from
[1:52:53] any other youth
[1:52:55] group it's not your
[1:52:58] sincerity I me listen friends we got to
[1:53:00] be sincere not saying it's not I'm just
[1:53:03] telling you this brother Bown said
[1:53:04] Israel was just another
[1:53:06] Nation you take God you separate Israel
[1:53:09] from God they were just another Nation
[1:53:12] he said you take the holy ghost out of
[1:53:13] the church it's just a it's just a it's
[1:53:16] just another building with God's name
[1:53:18] attached to it
[1:53:21] take the spirit of God out of your life
[1:53:23] amen you're just like anybody else he
[1:53:25] said you take the the Holy Ghost off of
[1:53:27] Samson he was just another
[1:53:30] man is that right what makes you
[1:53:33] different is God is in the midst of
[1:53:37] her she shall not be
[1:53:43] moved the Heathen rage the kingdoms are
[1:53:46] moved he uttered his voice the Earth
[1:53:48] melted the Lord of hosts is with us the
[1:53:52] god of Jacob is our
[1:53:54] refuge you believe it
[1:53:58] tonight I'm just going to turn a corner
[1:54:00] real quickly for the next few minutes
[1:54:03] because I preached a long time showing
[1:54:06] you how that we cannot be moved we will
[1:54:09] not be
[1:54:11] moved but I want to tell
[1:54:13] you there is something that will move a
[1:54:16] real
[1:54:18] believer a little while back a brother
[1:54:21] shared something with me I thought was
[1:54:22] powerful it's actually sermon
[1:54:24] notes from brother
[1:54:27] brandham and I believe that it was uh
[1:54:30] published by brother George Smith maybe
[1:54:32] years ago but the sermon notes um
[1:54:36] brother Brown writes this notice him
[1:54:38] Elijah in the cave he said the Oneness
[1:54:41] storm Billy
[1:54:42] Graham the uh he said the one is Storm
[1:54:45] rather that's the first part Billy
[1:54:48] Graham the Earth shaking C campaigns or
[1:54:51] Roberts the Pentecostal rushing wind
[1:54:54] never moved the
[1:54:55] prophet he said they were only
[1:54:59] effects of his passing by but what
[1:55:03] attracted the Prophet Elijah it was the
[1:55:06] glory of his voice
[1:55:09] word revealing his glory
[1:55:12] plans the prophet waited on his office
[1:55:15] seat notice a type not long then to the
[1:55:18] rapture he was only near in the wind and
[1:55:22] in the earthquake and in the fire but
[1:55:25] the man of God waited for the manifested
[1:55:27] reality Vindicated word abiding Glory
[1:55:32] brother bham is actually referring to
[1:55:34] the scripture there Amen in in First
[1:55:36] Kings 19 of course but watch what
[1:55:39] brother B would say in the message what
[1:55:41] hearest thou Elijah he said listen
[1:55:43] brother you might have a lot of noise
[1:55:46] but I wonder how much spirit is behind
[1:55:48] it see that's what what I'm wondering it
[1:55:50] it isn't the noise that makes the spirit
[1:55:53] see I've seen people that could jump and
[1:55:55] run and shout and play bands and run up
[1:55:57] and down the platform and didn't have
[1:55:59] enough real true Faith to stop a
[1:56:01] toothache but see it's that still small
[1:56:04] voice of God that operates the power of
[1:56:07] God that makes the real amen makes
[1:56:09] things real and brings life to the
[1:56:11] church that's what I'm speaking of it
[1:56:13] ain't the noise that counts it's the
[1:56:16] Vindication the spirit of God that makes
[1:56:19] the difference
[1:56:20] it's been here night each night
[1:56:22] performing signs and wonders and
[1:56:24] miracles among the people it's
[1:56:26] true he said I don't see how these
[1:56:28] Pentecostal people who claim to have
[1:56:30] kissed the cup of the golden blessings
[1:56:31] of Jesus Christ can sit still hardly
[1:56:35] when the Holy Ghost is moving in such
[1:56:36] things because it ain't got no noise
[1:56:39] behind the SE the noise went first then
[1:56:41] the still Small Voice amen we've had
[1:56:44] those things it was all God's way listen
[1:56:47] now and listen close God was attracting
[1:56:50] the attention of Elijah Elijah
[1:56:53] represents the church he was making him
[1:56:56] listen but now when the time come for
[1:56:58] the voice to speak that's something in
[1:57:01] our
[1:57:04] heart Hallelujah he said some time ago I
[1:57:08] seen a picture in Germany called the
[1:57:10] cloud
[1:57:11] picture he said it looks horrible when
[1:57:13] you look at it it looks like a big mess
[1:57:15] of
[1:57:16] clouds and he said he says all all these
[1:57:20] clouds wated together it looks like a
[1:57:22] horrible thing but when you get closer
[1:57:24] to it the closer you get you find out it
[1:57:29] ain't clouds it's angel's wings beaten
[1:57:32] together rejoicing the Praises of God
[1:57:35] and you've seen the Pentecostal
[1:57:37] experience and you looked at it from
[1:57:39] afar off and you say oh listen at that
[1:57:42] and all this and the Thunders and the
[1:57:44] rushing winds but if you'll just get
[1:57:46] close to it and get in into it you'll
[1:57:50] find out the closer you get the more
[1:57:52] real it becomes and that still small
[1:57:55] voice of God brings out the Angelic part
[1:57:58] of God and speaks to his people it's not
[1:58:01] as rough as it looks amen it's the glory
[1:58:03] of God but you're standing off looking
[1:58:06] at
[1:58:07] it amen you see what brother Bram is
[1:58:09] saying he's talking about all the
[1:58:11] commotion and and all of the noise and
[1:58:14] the rejoicing there ain't nothing wrong
[1:58:16] with it brother B ain't trying to do
[1:58:18] away with that he's just saying look
[1:58:20] that's not what moved the
[1:58:23] prophet amen listen that's not what
[1:58:26] that's not what's going to move you to a
[1:58:28] true
[1:58:30] experience he said but listen if you
[1:58:32] stand a far off and look at it all
[1:58:35] you're going to see is the noise and the
[1:58:38] excitement and you're going to look at
[1:58:39] it and say that's just a workup and
[1:58:41] that's just a motion he said but if
[1:58:43] you'll get close
[1:58:47] enough and get in
[1:58:49] [Music]
[1:58:51] it then you'll hear the still small
[1:58:53] voice of God speaking to your heart and
[1:58:56] then you begin to realize wait a minute
[1:58:58] this ain't a motion this ain't a workup
[1:59:02] this is
[1:59:03] God speaking to my
[1:59:07] heart Hallelujah and listen re in all
[1:59:10] the noise and in all the rejoicing in
[1:59:13] all the excitement you've got to hear
[1:59:15] the still small
[1:59:18] voice
[1:59:22] he said that's what moved the
[1:59:26] prophet that's what moved the prophet
[1:59:29] that's what'll move the
[1:59:31] bride let me tell you something friends
[1:59:33] it's not that we're un
[1:59:36] unmovable we cannot be moved off the
[1:59:42] word is that right amen we can't be
[1:59:45] moved off the word and that but there's
[1:59:47] but there is something that will move
[1:59:49] move this bride amen is the Holy Spirit
[1:59:52] by the
[1:59:53] word I prove it to you amen because a
[1:59:57] amen how many remembers amen that the
[1:59:59] that the Holy Spirit sposed to the
[2:00:01] prophet pick up your pin and write and
[2:00:02] as he's writing that remember he said
[2:00:05] the bride will have thus sayith the Lord
[2:00:08] or she'll keep
[2:00:11] still is that what he said the bride
[2:00:14] will have thus said the Lord or she'll
[2:00:16] keep still in other words she's not
[2:00:19] going to be moved by everything she's
[2:00:21] not going to be moved by every little
[2:00:24] new doctrine that rises up amen the
[2:00:27] latest greatest amen Revelation that
[2:00:29] comes along that's not going to move the
[2:00:30] real
[2:00:32] bride amen she's going to have th say
[2:00:34] the Lord or she'll stand
[2:00:39] still can I show it to you in the
[2:00:41] scripture second Samuel
[2:00:44] 523 and when David inquired of the
[2:00:48] Lord he said Thou shalt not go up but
[2:00:51] fet a compass behind them and come upon
[2:00:54] them over against the mberry trees now
[2:00:56] David is getting listen the enemy has
[2:00:58] come to fight against Israel and no
[2:01:00] doubt amen amen the Army is wan to stand
[2:01:02] their ground they're wanting to go and
[2:01:03] fight they're wanting to defend the land
[2:01:05] amen they're want listen friends and
[2:01:07] they're no doubt looking back and
[2:01:08] they're say it's ours it's been given to
[2:01:10] us by promise amen and all these things
[2:01:12] but David say we're not going to we're
[2:01:14] not going to move an
[2:01:15] inch until we first inquire of the Lord
[2:01:19] yes and God said don't go down move
[2:01:22] around amen and and fetch a compass
[2:01:25] behind them and come over against him in
[2:01:27] the mberry trees and let it be when thou
[2:01:29] hearest the sound of the going in the
[2:01:31] top of the mberry trees amen then that
[2:01:34] then Thou shalt bester thyself for then
[2:01:36] shall the Lord go out before thee to
[2:01:38] Smite the host of the Philistines and
[2:01:41] David did so as the Lord had commanded
[2:01:43] him and he smok the Philistines
[2:01:46] hallelujah amen the prophet said in the
[2:01:47] message absolute again he said said how
[2:01:49] David when he was going to battle and
[2:01:51] the opposition was great and David laid
[2:01:53] under the tree and sweated out until he
[2:01:55] heard the sound going through the mberry
[2:01:57] bushes then it was
[2:02:00] different David Rose up and went out
[2:02:02] because he had an absolute he knew that
[2:02:06] God was going before
[2:02:11] him

[2:02:21] imagine they come along ask David David

[2:03:01] you see what the enemy's doing no I'm
[2:03:04] watching these
[2:03:08] trees and David turned his back to the
[2:03:12] enemy he says I'm not going to watch
[2:03:16] that and I really don't care what
[2:03:18] they're doing
[2:03:20] and I'm not going to keep my eyes on on

[2:06:21] you or all these all these things this
[2:06:23] this is where the devil's going to work
[2:06:24] on you in
[2:06:26] this but brother Brown in perfect Faith
[2:06:30] he said
[2:06:33] Jesus what gave him such Faith was he
[2:06:36] had confidence in who he was because of
[2:06:39] what the word said about
[2:06:40] [Music]
[2:06:42] him he was the word made
[2:06:45] flesh he said if he could have that
[2:06:47] confidence he said could did you not
[2:06:48] have the same confidence as a
[2:06:52] Believer and he said a Believer is a
[2:06:55] Believer is the faith of God that moves
[2:06:58] in
[2:07:00] you the believer is the faith of God
[2:07:03] listen I want tell you there ain't but
[2:07:05] one the
[2:07:06] faith brother B said that's the faith
[2:07:09] that was once delivered to the Saints
[2:07:11] Paul said the life that I now live amen
[2:07:14] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[2:07:17] not in the son of God the Son of God
[2:07:19] it's not your faith it's his faith in
[2:07:23] you and brother Brown said a Believer is
[2:07:26] the faith of God that moves in
[2:07:30] you let me tell you something one day
[2:07:35] disciples was out on on a
[2:07:38] boat
[2:07:40] and there a great storm
[2:07:43] come and in the middle of that storm
[2:07:46] Brother David Jesus
[2:07:49] come walking on the
[2:07:50] water now when Jesus come walking on
[2:07:53] that
[2:07:54] water they the Bible says they were
[2:07:59] afraid brother R would say the very
[2:08:01] thing the only thing that could actually
[2:08:03] help them there was afraid of
[2:08:06] it they looked at thought man this is a
[2:08:08] spirit and this is it was Supernatural
[2:08:11] you see something they couldn't
[2:08:13] reconcile in their mind
[2:08:15] or understand in that way so they were
[2:08:18] afraid of
[2:08:20] it and Peter I love Peter I tell you
[2:08:24] he's one of my favorite favorite Bible
[2:08:26] characters cuz I so identify with him he
[2:08:28] makes all kind of mistakes and says
[2:08:30] things he shouldn't say when he the
[2:08:32] wrong time and any of y'all ever feel
[2:08:34] that
[2:08:36] way but you know in spite of all the
[2:08:39] mistakes Peter made you got give
[2:08:41] him it was something special about that
[2:08:44] Peter had
[2:08:45] because he looked out there and he said
[2:08:47] Lord if it's
[2:08:50] you bid me
[2:08:56] come and brother Brown said when Jesus
[2:08:59] spoke the word
[2:09:02] come he said the word told Peter he
[2:09:05] could walk on the
[2:09:08] water and Peter's faith in that word
[2:09:11] moved him out of the boat onto the
[2:09:15] water listen some of y'all might be
[2:09:17] sitting in the seat tonight and you
[2:09:19] might be wondering is this real
[2:09:22] or is this the spirit of God is this is
[2:09:25] this reality or is this just a an
[2:09:28] excitement of a meeting or just what is
[2:09:31] this why don't you just say in your
[2:09:33] heart tonight
[2:09:35] Lord if it's
[2:09:37] you bid me
[2:09:40] come and you let God speak to you and
[2:09:42] that Stills my voice and if you move
[2:09:45] down here tonight and you come in this
[2:09:46] prayer line you come because God spoke
[2:09:50] to your
[2:09:51] heart and the word of God spoke directly
[2:09:54] to you and you move by the faith of
[2:09:57] God and when the Devil comes next week
[2:09:59] and says oh you just got excited you
[2:10:01] look at that devil and say no
[2:10:03] devil it wasn't emotion that moved me it
[2:10:06] wasn't excitement that moved me it was
[2:10:09] God's word that spoke to my
[2:10:13] heart say you might be saying well
[2:10:16] brother Josh I've tried this before well
[2:10:18] there another time Peter was out
[2:10:20] fishing and they had told all
[2:10:23] night you remember that and they had
[2:10:27] done everything they could and tried as
[2:10:28] hard as they could and
[2:10:31] failed they fished all night and at the
[2:10:33] end of the night they were just
[2:10:34] disappointed with empty
[2:10:37] Nets Jesus come along and said why don't
[2:10:41] you launch out in the deep and drop your
[2:10:43] nets Peter said but
[2:10:46] Lord see he couldn't understand it but

[4:09:50] ahead let's hold the music down let's
[4:09:53] hold the music
[4:09:56] down there's a chief demon moving in the
[4:10:02] place and it's called
[4:10:05] anxiety and fear
[4:10:08] and it's bouncing from person to
[4:10:10] person mainly because our eyes are open
[4:10:13] and we're looking around and he bounces
[4:10:16] from this person to that person from
[4:10:18] this person to that person the prophet
[4:10:20] of God said the devil will always cuse
[4:10:22] for
[4:10:23] help and that's what he's been doing
[4:10:26] tonight so I want everybody the prophet
[4:10:29] of God said when the chief demon is cast
[4:10:32] out everybody can have their
[4:10:35] Deliverance so the chief demon demon
[4:10:38] that I'm sure all these brothers have
[4:10:39] been hearing about tonight is
[4:10:42] anxiety and
[4:10:44] fear anxiety and
[4:10:47] fear anxiety and fear that's all we
[4:10:49] hearing anxiety fear the chief demon
[4:10:52] fighting all these young people we have
[4:10:55] nothing to be afraid of we got God on
[4:10:57] our
[4:10:58] [Applause]
[4:11:06] side so I want from this
[4:11:09] point none of you to walk out of here
[4:11:12] afraid
[4:11:13] again afraid of Life afraid of how you
[4:11:17] going to serve God afraid of your future
[4:11:20] afraid of a sickness some some the devil
[4:11:24] is doing some even afraid of
[4:11:27] crowds it's a spirit evil spirit and
[4:11:31] anxiety is no more than just
[4:11:34] fear so we want to bind up the spirit of
[4:11:36] fear God has not giv us the spirit of
[4:11:39] fear but love power and a sound
[4:11:43] mind and perfect love castes out all
[4:11:48] fear and what brought this to me was
[4:11:51] just
[4:11:52] hearing you know fear fear fear the
[4:11:56] prophet of God said
[4:11:58] that what Mak what makes God omnipresent
[4:12:03] is because he's omnicient he knows all
[4:12:06] things so he can be every place at you
[4:12:10] know because that's who he is Satan
[4:12:12] can't do
[4:12:14] that so he's bouncing right he's
[4:12:19] bouncing now you want to close the door
[4:12:22] tonight everybody close the door of fear
[4:12:25] tonight close the door of anxiety
[4:12:28] tonight but it's going to take a spirit
