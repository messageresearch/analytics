TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just instruct us and admonish us and correct us and encourage us the word has the ability to do all of that and it might do something different for you than it does to your neighbor but just say Lord whatever you want to say to me say it to me this morning I'm ready to receive it Zechariah Chapter 12 we'll just begin reading I want to speak to you this morning on the right expectation the right expectation Zechariah Chapter 12 and we'll just read a few verses here let's just let me let me pull it up here rather than just maybe get a little bit of context Zechariah Chapter 12. what is we're going to read verse 9 and verse 10 and 11 but I just want to pick up maybe a few verses before that let's start here with verse 7. the Lord also shall save the tents of Judah first but the glory of the House of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themself against Judah in that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David now that's a very profound verse I don't know if you ever caught that before I had it until last night just reading it and that day now what day is he speaking of this is the day of the Lord it's not the day of the astronaut it's not the day of the horse and buggy it's not the day of the tank or the nuclear bomb there's a day for that this is now the day of the Lord so we're fast forwarding on the timeline for the Lord to have his day and when the day of the Lord comes you better have the Lord amen and if you don't have him now you won't have him then the day of the Lord so notice in that day this is I'm preaching to you this morning on the right expectation now brother Branham used Israel as God's timepiece and many people look at Israel and we watched uh all we're always keen on on that as Believers what's happening in current events what's happening in the news what's happening with Russia what's happening with Rome what's happening with Israel always Keen as a Believer you're always Keen in on that there's a reason there's a good reason for that but many people if you could say what happens next what is the right expectation of what is going to happen next for Israel some are looking for a temple others looking for a red heifer others are looking for the temple to be restored others are looking for the Feast of Passover or the Feast of Tabernacles but this is what the Bible says is next this is what's next for Israel it's not a Revival yet because they're in sin the Bible says that God for the sake of us has blinded their eyes right but the Bible says that the next thing for Israel before God opens their eyes they're going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the prophet said just like you receive it they'll receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the the spirit of of God by the Holy Ghost fell in Jerusalem one time and people spoke in tongues and prophesied that won't be the only time that the spirit of God pours out in the city of Jerusalem there's actually another pouring out of that spirit that the Bible prophesies but this time it'll be to the Jews now notice what's next though what's next and it may be not what you what they would want to hear maybe it's depressing to think about but the next event for Israel is an international Army an international United Nations that the entire all the nations of the earth will Encompass and Surround Jerusalem and they'll actually destroy the city they'll ravish the women they'll murder the children they'll murder that we're about to read it here in a moment that's what's next on Israel's timeline so it's not a if you would say what's next is on the horizon is something you know with fireworks and great grand things but actually what's next is very Bleak what the scripture records in Zachariah Zachariah was one of the Minor Prophets but it's the most important book for believers Gentile Believers to look at when you're looking at Zion or Israel's prophecy where they're at in Prophecy notice here in verse 6 and that day will I make the governors of Judah let's let's look at this let me make sure let's pick it up from verse 8. in that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem and he that is feeble among them so all those that are discouraged and you can imagine there would be great discouragement after this ransacking of the city after this besieging of the city and after all of the destruction and all of the all of the Bloodshed everyone's going to be downcast you can imagine depressed you can imagine out out of it really but the Bible says that in that day he that is feeble among them shall be as David so a spirit or an anointing will come upon the Jews that will be the same anointing of a warrior as David incredible and the House of David that means his descendants when you read that that means his lineage his line the House of David shall be as God and the angel of the Lord before them verse 9 and it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem and I will pour upon the House of David now here you read these words it's the same thing you read in Joel I know you have you standing to stay with me for a moment and Joe you have in in that in the in in the prophecy in the Book of Joel that I will pour my spirit out upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters will prophesy your old mental dream dreams your young mental see Visions you know that scripture so that's referencing what happened in the upper room in the book of in the book of Acts but this is a different reference he's pouring out his Spirit notice and I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace they're going to need it they're going to need it this is a stubborn and rebellious people they're going to need a spirit of Grace say brother Matt why is that important because as we live in our lives we type where Israel is at as a gentile Church so what's going to be poured upon the bride before the body change a spirit of Grace and let me just say I'm going to need it how many could say I'm going to need it Lord a spirit of Grace and supplications that's prayer and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn in that day there shall be great mourning in Jerusalem let's just bow our heads and pray Lord we we're so thankful Lord that we have something that we could look to that's so real Lord not Lord just a figment of someone's imagination or uh Lord a historical record of something that someone told us but we have that Living Word that's proven yourself alive Lord after your Lord by infallible proofs Lord You've proven yourself alive amongst your people we're so glad Lord that we can look to your word this morning and we can have confidence in what we read we could have confidence in how we live Lord I pray God that you would come and make this word real to every person that's here Lord those that are not present I pray that you bless our pastor Lord as he's away ministering now in Virginia she's maybe even now going to the pulpit I pray God you would anoint him with your spirit Lord we ask it now in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen you can be seated this morning I'm just going to reference something brother Brandon I didn't put it on the PowerPoint so you just have to listen he's speaking about a trip that he took uh to Glacier uh National Park and he goes there with his wife and his children and they announce that there's going to be a a fire show that they're going to light the glacier uh with lights and it's uh with fire and brother Brandon was there with his wife and with his children and he's asking am I going to see it they're they're hiking all day in Glacier and he and he asks you know when the show is going to happen and they're wanting they're busy trying to that's they're eager about it wanting to see this to make sure that they don't miss it and he speaks about this in the invisible Union and he talks about how he goes up to the park ranger and he's or the men who's preparing and he says you know what time is it going to be and and well you know is it going to happen and they say yeah it's going to happen where uh you know we're going to do it we do it about every time this summer and and so they brother Brandon keeps going back and they don't they want to make sure that they don't miss it they're going to be hiking in the wilderness and want to make sure that they're there when it happens so he continues to ask uh what you know what time is it going to be and the man keeps telling him uh we we're promised we promised that we're gonna do it listen to what brother Brandon says here the man says said we promised it tonight we promised it the men are up there right now they're getting it ready now after all that had been made ready for the event listen that's what's taking place right now all is being made ready for the event a church being pulled out for his namesake taking his bride out from among the world these denominations and all the world and all the filth of the things of the world notice this is what's happening right now brother Brandon begins to to catch something here that has the expectation of his family was to see this and there was people preparing it and he stops and this is in the invisible Union and said that's what's taking place right now now you may not see it you may not hear it you may be living your every single day life but as Jacob falls asleep and sees Angels descending and ascending and the Bible says in god Jehovah was over at all what was God showing Jacob that though you may not feel it there's a plan and a purpose that's constantly being worked at whether you feel it or not God is never sleeping he's always busy brother Adam says after all that he then he says that's what's taking place all is being made ready everybody the event Was Made ready everybody was standing out there they said now keep watching keep watching look up there right on top of the mountain now notice all was ready everything had been kindled and made ready and everybody was standing out I had my head sticking up my arm around my wife we was looking watching he's there watching the mountain telling his children keep your eye on that mountain Don't Take Your Eye Off of it but Daddy it's not nothing's happening just keep watching it something's about to take place they're about to light the glaze the mountain on fire and and he says they're all there everything's been prepared everything's ready it's all been kindled everyone was standing there he says we was looking children standing there all of us looking like that my it was something because we was expecting it because it was promised to us and all at once we heard something from the top of the hill a voice come down through the loudspeaker all things are ready now then this man standing there right beside me said Let the Fire Fall here it come pouring down across the mountain a glacier of fire and blazing licking oh it was a sight to behold brother let's get all these things ready for one of these days the fire is going to fall we're going up you believe that now let's get ready for the fire falling time we're in the last days we all know that and we're ready for the coming of the Lord the thing to do now is separate yourself from all sin separate yourself from anything that pertains to the world don't love the things of don't love the world or the things of the world what was it there was an expectation and it's so important that you have the right expectation you could monitor survey anybody in the world today no matter what nation that you would go to they would be living for a certain expectation that would be living for a certain future and that's their motivation that's what drives them that's what determines where they live how they live uh what how they're going what they're going to be how they'll dress how they'll act how they'll live it's based upon the expectation that they have when you came to church today you had an expectation brother Brandon said this way you'll get whatever you expect you'll get whatever you expect whatever you put in is what you're going to get out this was a water cup here and we had poured half of it I could only expect to get half of it out because that's all that I put in thank you when you come to the house of God if all you put in is a little half glass that's about all you're going to get but if you pour all of yourself into your expectation are you following me this morning brother man says that was the expectation that they they were living under this expectation so notice what I just want to go through this and this is going to be I want you to have all of this took a lot of time if you have that PowerPoint brother Josh go ahead and put it up took a lot of time to prepare this so I want you just to if I don't get anywhere this morning the Lord is so constrain my heart for this Sunday morning message to get this I have a lot the Lord wants me to get to but if we don't get to anything let me just say this is the main event listen to what brother Branham starts to speak about about expectations or about what's let me let me say it this way what is Promised because he gives the story the example of the men and he says we were in expectation of it because God had promised it so then you say what what are we an expectation of well we're an expectation of whatever was promised to us and I want to say I want everything that was promised to me I want to claim all of it you say brother Matt what is promised to the to the elected what is promise and this is just a brief study if you ever want a very good resource brother gerd roadwald in Germany created an archive that a brother put together you could find it called spiritual building Stones I pulled this directly from that it's just so so wonderful listen to some of these were promised in this last day this is this is um the marriage of the bride and I didn't put I put the quote what where I'm reading this from right underneath it this is out of proving his word so what is Promised in this day or in this hour or in this generation what's promised is the marriage of the Bride to the lamb that was promised in this day listen prophet of God says Jesus says As it was in the days of Sodom and I have here in Luke these are not in the quote uh these are actually just where we've inserted them in Red so that if you want a Biblical reference you can go back and find it as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so it will be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed no he says not no more as a church not no more the brides called in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride now I'm reading you you could use thousands of quotes but I'm reading you things that are specific that are promised in the message to you and I want it if it's for me I want it and I want to make sure I don't miss it and he says to join the church the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down first Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself shall descend with a shout with the voice with the trumpet and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergy man I don't know do you see what I mean so see it's son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real then it'll unite the church and him as one this is why the prophet's Ministry was so thoroughly Vindicated God didn't have to do that God could have sent one sign and that would have been enough to catch the elected to get their attention remember it's not the sign that you're connected to it's not the sign that we're that we're connected to the sign was sent to get your attention it's the word that you're magnetized to Jesus says there's that an adulterous generation seeks after a sign remember when the Pharisees came to him and he's eating corn and they get upset and they say Jesus says uh you know begins to quote them from David and the but Jesus stops and says they said show us a sign and Jesus says an adulteress and a wicked generation seeketh after a son so let's not be sign Seekers you say why brother Matt because Jesus said it was an adulterous and wicked generation that seeks after a sign signs brother Branham says we don't seek after signs signs follow us it's it's a it's a very important distinction and he says there shall be no sign given unto it except the sign of Jonas now notice who is three days in the belly the entire picture you see here in the Bible is that the sign they were looking for was standing right in front of them and they missed it it went right over their head the sign that you're looking for is right in front of them notice he'll come down Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh and will make his word so real that it will unite the church in him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper so where do we go when we go when we meet the Lord in the air when we go we're not going to a marriage we're going to a supper so where does the marriage take place right now right now God's uniting his word with the word that's inside of you and if you don't have the seed the word of God inside of you it'll never take it'll never Unite it'll intellectually agree but it will never Unite with the word because brother random says what is it you when you heard the message he says you recognize that it is Eagle food you heard from your theophany so there was something already inside of you that was part of what you heard and it connected when you heard it listen the bride and then she'll go home she's already united we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word in the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing now we're speaking on the right expectations I believe expectations are so important you get what you expect and it's important that we set the right expectation as ministers as people as the family of God as parents we set the right expectations because if you're not expecting something it'll never come to you Jesus says he'll appear to those who are looking for him so if you're not looking for him or you're looking for the wrong thing you'll never see him you miss it entirely so I want to say Lord let me make sure I'm looking for the right thing about my expectation to be expecting the right thing and he says the church becomes one whatever the son of man does the church does the same thing Revelation is 19. here's another promise the son of man back in the church again this is the Mighty God unveiled before us in 1964. the son of man back in the church again revealed in human beings huh that's powerful the son of man back in the church revealed in human beings not the Son of God but the son of man again back in his church again in the last days we find that he promised that it that in God's promises and we find out here that God has always had skin on him when Moses seen him he had skin on him looked like a man when God was behind the curtains he had skin on him and God tonight in his church is veiled in his church with skin on him he's still the same God tonight we find that but now as ever the skin Veil is what catches the Traditions they just can't believe that that's god making them people act like that it's because God's veiled in his church in skin skin on it that's right he's hid from the unbeliever and revealed to the believer now when their traditionville of the elders and the word is broke through oh of course today notice when their tradition view of the elders and the word is broke through so when you remove the religious Veil when you remove the tradition Veil when you remove well that's not how my church did it well that's not how I was raised well that's not what I think when you get past all of that then comes in plain view we see him deity again veiled in human flesh Hebrew said so and also Genesis 18 18 you remember God was a man standing there eating and talking with Abraham told him what Sarah was doing in the tent behind and Jesus says As it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man deity veiled again in human flesh now remember Jesus didn't say when the son of man is the Son of God is being revealed and Luke the 17th chapter 30th verse he said when the son of man is being revealed the son of man back in the church again revealed in human beings not Son of God but the son of man again notice brother Brandon gives this pattern and he says you'll always notice that religion has always been one step behind they've always missed it and been blind to it because of a traditional veil of what they thought about God or how they thought he would appear when he was Jehovah they didn't recognize him when he was tabernacled in the Tabernacle of Moses only a small little group recognized who he was the rest of the world went on living their lives raising children planting Farms building houses and they missed they failed to recognize the word or the anointed word or the anointed form of the word of their generation they missed it in Jehovah but notice when Jesus appears they accept Jehovah but they miss Jesus they're always one step behind Now They didn't accept Jehovah now now that now they can see God in the scroll they can see God in the law but they missed it the word had been had moved and now remember the law was just a shadow the law was just a shadow so what is a shatter you can see Shadows really good here this morning you see Shadows on that back wall right there see that shadow this was the law but you know what happened when Jesus came Jesus was the object of The Shadow and to reject the object and to stay in the shadow was death you had to come out of the Shadow and accept the object that the shadow was reflecting so they missed Christ the anointed word but now look at the world we live in today oh man everybody loves Jesus now that now the out of his bodily form now that he's not Jesus of Nazareth anymore walking the swords of Galilee everybody's got a Bible everybody's got a cross on their window everybody everybody's Christians now but they reject the son of man that was revealed through a prophet they missed the anointed word they're always tradition always blinds people religion always blinds people they miss it they couldn't see the pro they couldn't see that the word had been made flesh again you see men always have trouble brother Brandon said it this way man never has trouble except in a god of History he always struggles when you bring that God out of history and you bring him present tense and so they they miss they reject the word they reject the anointed word what word is brother random say in here the word in flesh again Jesus didn't say he says the son of man back in the church again revealed in human beings not Son of God but son of man back in his church we find that he promised that it's God's promise we notice another thing in the old Badger skins what did it do it hid the glory of God from the people the reason that people couldn't see it because it was a skin that held it he's speaking of the Tabernacle and behind the badger skin was the pre was the Shekinah Glory the glory of God was behind the skin and now the glory of God is behind your skin do you notice what happens with your faith oh we're preaching about the Shekinah Glory in the Old Testament oh I believe it preaching about the glory revealed in Jesus oh I believe it even today preaching about the glory revealed in God's Prophet oh I believe it but now the glory has moved and it's revealed or wants to reveal himself through your skin I say Lord reveal yourself let me get out of the way and let yourself be translated let yourself be projected through my life and the Traditions don't see it it's inside the veil where the word was it's inside the veil where the word was lost control there we go the son of man is Christ he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man listen if you read the message of the hour and you just think you're reading the words of William Branham you will get nothing from any Eternal benefit at all if you think you're just reading the words of the man you'll receive nothing but when you can receive it as the voice behind The Voice and that it's God tabernacled in a man that we don't worship the man but the the voice of God tabernacled through his mouthpiece when you view it that way God can speak to you through that man and if you don't all you get is hunting stories and fishing stories and traditions and doctrines and three one God instead of three an original sin was adultery it wasn't an app all those things are true but when you move Beyond it and you get beyond the badger skin and you see the glory of God then you recognize your day and its message the son of man is Christ he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man so they missed it and Generation Now people have recognized the glory that people have recognized the voice behind the voice they have accepted the messenger but now they reject the anointed word of that message living behind people do you follow that notice what brother random says this is another promise this was a promise for this generation the entire Holy Spirit visits the church do you know that's a promise for 2000 for 2022. I should have got uh every voice that's in here to say Amen do you know that's a promise why is that important because if you're not if you don't realize that's a promise you won't expect this but when you read that this is your promise then you expect that the entire Holy Spirit notice and now the entire this is desperations 1963 in September the entire Holy Spirit visits the church making God in human flesh as he did before Sodom the burning bush there was which was a type the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2 000 years but it's to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed there it is again in human flesh in the evening time why did Brother Branham turn his back to the audience and then begin to discern people with his back turn what was it it was a sign of the same God the same Melchizedek that met Abraham had now returned back to a people again it was significant notice in human flesh he said he promised it this is another promise for your generation that we're coming to perfection now I know a lot of y'all don't feel perfect this morning but it's got to be your expectation notice it's not what you're presently living it's not where you're presently at stop looking at your present and look at your promise stop looking at what you see and set your goal on what God has promised and say Lord I may not be here but I believe I'm going to confess you're bringing me to this this is perfect faith we are coming now to Perfection because the people have to come to this in order for the Rapture did you hear that we're coming to perfect to we're coming to Perfection because the people how many is the people have to come to this in order for the rapture that's what's holding it away right now waiting for the church to come into that perfect raptured faith it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there notice the Bible said so Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect not a faith but a perfect Faith Build It Up in here and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word I want you to key it on that word perfect heart because it doesn't mean you're a perfect person doesn't mean remember Sister Bruce brother Brandon but I make so many mistakes God doesn't look at your mistakes Mr Bruce he looks at what's in your heart and a person who really has that you say brother Matt you can't preach that because then people will say well I I don't live right but it's in my heart no no no no a real believer who really has it in their heart will live every day striving and struggling and fighting if they have to call their way to it they may be down in the dirt and down in the dumps but there's something inside of them saying Lord perfect me Lord change me Lord for forgive me Lord change me Lord move me Lord grow me mature me watch a perfect heart with a perfect Promise by his perfect word them who lived back there was not perfect until this church this is the Old Testament Saints this is all of those who have fallen asleep remember they're not dead they just have fallen asleep all of them that have fallen asleep he says them who live back there was not perfect until this church be perfected the bride group and the last days to bring them in and all together be taken up and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word by Divine vindication the promise for this for for the day and age this is one you can take a hold of a lot of rain poured out upon the people in the last days this is 1964 the Mighty God unveiled before us I think the Greek word is Keynotes which means that he emptied himself out not in the way we would say like something was inside of somebody that had emptied out but he poured himself remember not a gift gifts are wonderful thank God for the gifts but now it's not the gift that you receive it's The Giver it's not the Revival that you're part of that you meet I love the Revival but I met the reviver Hallelujah and he says he says he emptied himself himself he changed in more faith he changed from what he was to what he is he never changes his nature that is he changed himself he poured himself into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the Holy Spirit he says not another person went at him call the Holy Spirit but it was he himself you get that he himself poured himself into the prophet into the people Christ in you Colossians 1. Christ in you how beautiful how wonderful to think God poured himself into the human being into the believer pour out it was a part of his drama to do so it was a part of his drama remember when you don't see the Bible as a historical history but you see this as his story that it's a drama that's being played out and you're a you're a player you're an actor in this drama you say My Little Life That's brother Matt you don't even understand I I'm just a I'm just a little nobody I don't have any part I don't play really any role I I struggle if you've seen my daily I might look good dressed up nice have my tie buttoned up on Sunday and and everybody thinks I got it all together but boy you should see me on Monday morning and traffic you should see me on Tuesday at work you should see me Wednesday night when we're trying to get ready for church you should see our children you should see our home but surely not I couldn't be God says I've designed and interwoven all of those parts of your life and all of those parts are part of the Great drama that I'm gonna take a people that's so messed up and so far away and so distant but I'm gonna bring them unto myself I'm going to take Fallen humanity and I'm going to put my life inside of them and bring them to Perfection of the word I say be it unto me as Mary said according to your word Lord be it unto me he says it's part of his drama to do so God all the fullness all that God had bodily was in this person Jesus Christ he was God and God Alone not a third person or a second person or a first person but the person God veiled in human flesh oh there will be a true informed listen there will be a true former and latter rain in the last days upon that little group that should be our expectation there will be a former and a latter rain upon that little group that come with him on this little donkey low and humble no doubt denomination crying he says no doubt or denomination crying Hosanna to the king that comes in the name of the Lord he says there will be a ladder rain and a form of rain that's poured out upon that little humble group what's the attraction on the mount what is it there's a former Reign a teaching rain but there's coming a ladder rain there's coming a sweep there's coming a dynamic they don't change you they don't take those things that you can't change and it'll change them there's coming a dynamic Revival you say what Revival is that going to be brother man if I'm not looking for it I'll never be a part of it but I want to set my expectation to say Lord I want everything that you have for me I want to be a recipient let me be a vessel that's empty of any of myself so that you can pour all of yourself and I can receive all of it Lord this was the promise notice one of the promises it's uniting time of God and his brother this is Christ The Mystery of God revealed Christ the true headship coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning the head and the body are becoming one in works and in sign and in life Vindicated by God himself through his promised word of the last days he promised this in the last days now if you're spiritual you'll catch it the headship and the body has become one unit it's God manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer Twain they are one God and his church is one Christ in you God's Great Revelation even bearing his name you see Churches United Nations United but it's a uniting time of God and his bride too now the promise the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit it says 1963 what shall I do with Jesus called Christ the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit notice that we have worked in a small measure I read that this morning and thought wait a minute the Dynamics of the church will be a refilling of what I've witnessed brother Branham work in a small measure so you mean when he spoke to Hattie right and he and brother Brandon says she said the right words and says that's nothing but the truth brother Bynum brother random says when she spoke those words it moved heaven and brother Brandon says an anointing dropped in that room and I said sister Hattie the Holy Spirit liked that you said that and anything you ask right now will be given to you and he said she could have asked for ten thousand dollars should have he asked for anything she asked for the Salvation of her two boys and it was given to her just like that now this is what the prophet says the Dynamics that's coming to this church and I don't want you to think of it as somewhere off in the misty blue it's happening right now it's happening right now whether whether I'm a part of it or not doesn't mean it's not happening whether I miss it entirely doesn't stop it from happening whether I'm off in in la la land something's happening right now I want to say Lord let me be a part of it don't let me miss it Lord don't let me miss it let my expectation oh how many hands would go up and say Lord don't let me miss it I don't want to miss it I want my expectation to be on the right thing the devil if he can do anything or get my my my expectation misaligned with something that it shouldn't be on what is my expectation that the Dynamics that are coming that are happening that are falling he says that we've worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full somebody say fool the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will raise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit the Dynamics there will come a sound from Heaven that will take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride it'll take her the bride from the earth and a rapturing Grace and to glory in the rapture God promised it this is one promise that's for you the body change and how many hurt and bodies said amen it's a promise if you're not expecting it if you're not looking for it the body changed let it off the pressure that next thing the next thing will be a sweep I don't know what that sweep will feel like but I can't wait for it to happen the next thing will be a imagine maybe you'll be at work maybe you'll be at home mopping your floors maybe you'll be in an office maybe that's what you do on a computer now you'll be maybe you'll be down on your knees maybe you'll be in a boat fishing I like to think that that's where I'll be all I know is brother Brandon says the next thing suddenly you're going through your normal life average life everyday living making plans for tomorrow planting your potatoes and then suddenly a sweep brother random says that little group together in a month or so should be gone and as soon as she's gathered together we're at the end there's no hope left nowhere and this is his admonition run to Christ people here's a promise the restoration end time evangelism I love this message 1962 the end time evangelism this is a promise that's for you the restoration the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for a Rapture that's the end time message there's a lot of things that encompasses that there's a lot of things in that bag there's a lot of things in that treasure but here's the purpose of the end time message to get you ready to get out of this place to get your children ready to get out of this place because we're not leaving anybody behind we're not leaving children grandchildren small children old children we're not leaving any hoof Moses said we're not going to leave any of them for you we're taking everything that belongs to us why brother Matt cause it's a promise that God made the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture what can it do according to Malachi 4 5 and 6 is bringing them back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bring them back what restoration we speak about this all the time or the man I hear it over and over let me say this young people because some of you that are not uh children this this will be Elementary for you let me say it just to the young people what is the restoration I'll send Elijah the prophet and he shall restore he shall turn the hearts of the fathers back to the children and the Heart of the children back to the fathers brother we hear it all the time the message we've received is a restoration message if you restore something you're not making it something new you're taking what it was originally and you're working to restore it back to the same condition pretty simple restoration 101 you're taking it back to the same condition you're not alternate you're not making it something that it wasn't you're restoring it back to how it looked in its first day so you say brother Matt then if the message is restoring us then what's it restoring us to let's let the prophet say that here the end time message he says according to Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers the Pentecostal part not 1906 Azusa Street the Pentecostal part is the book of Acts part it's the first church part in the restoration time I will restore saith the Lord that's real end time evangelism for God said I will restore it he's going to restore it Hell by four death Messengers killed it then by then four life Messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word what the word we need all of it what do we what have we been restored back to all of it brother Matt what part of it not not just a part of it all of it wait you mean the entire thing the whole book The the whole book the whole thing wasn't available to Martin it wasn't available to Colombia it wasn't available to John Wesley but it's available to you how do I get it go up and grab it take a hold of it the angel said to John John said give me the book and the angel said take it from my hand you know what happens when you take it then it becomes your book it's not mom's book it's not dad's book it's not the pastor's book it's not it's his promise or his inheritance it's mine it's my book it's my promise it's my inheritance he says by four death Messengers what happened sanctification say what part of it brother Matt everything that the first church had is your inheritance as a believer don't settle short of any of it say brother Matt then what is mine let me just tell you what the first church had the first church had the knowledge and the revelation of the word and they taught it and they preached it and they lived it did you hear me they had the word and they taught it so we don't do away with teaching and they preached it so we don't do away with preachers and they lived it this is what the first church had the first church had the demonstration when I'm preaching to you and I'm up here yelling and spitting that's not demonstrating the word I heard so somebody say that what a misunderstanding that is it is not demonstrating the word if I'm up here preaching that's good I I believe in Inspiration I believe in inspired preaching brother Adam says sometimes you you really clinch the nail but demonstration is when that word this word is living behind skin and you're demonstrating it with your life what did the first church have they had the demonstration of the Holy Ghost by the manifestation of gifts in the entire body not just the preachers it wasn't just Paul and Peter it wasn't just Silas it wasn't just it wasn't just Andrew this this wasn't this wasn't just a Ministry thing this wasn't just a preacher thing listen the message of the hour is not just to preach done just to preachers it's not just to little groups here and little groups there it's to the entire body it's to your children and your children's children as many of come on I should have an amen from that this morning it's to you it's you that should make you happy it's to me it's to me it's to you it's the letter it's written it's addressed to you it's your name your name's on the book when you recognize that the letter didn't just come to a prophet the prophet was just a mailman delivering a message from the throne it was not brother random's message it was the message from the throne why did the angel vindicate his ministry to show you that this is a message not from a Kentucky hillbilly it's from the very Throne of God the same voice that spoke to Moses the same voice that spoke to David the same voice that spoke to Joseph the same voice that spoke to Paul has now spoken again in this last day the first church had the demonstration of the Holy Ghost in gifts for the entire body not just the ministry the laity the people the non-ministerial gifts in the first church were not absorbers are sponges of everything Paul said they didn't just sit and go keep talking Paul I'm going to write it all down page two page three page four I'm gonna put that into a PDF document I'm going to print it now I'm going to make it into a book I'm going to put it on my shelf they weren't just absorbers of the word they took that word brother random says it this way he says he says that Paul saw it come in a subtle way of worship which excluded the people in any part in a holy ghost Ministry brother Brandon says but when he says but that's a far cry from what Paul preached he says when all come together all participate and spiritual worship can you say Amen they weren't absorbers what they heard and taught they were participators in spiritual worship the first church had listened to what they had the first church had the divine nature of Christ dwelling in them on a daily basis the divine nature of Jesus of Nazareth was now bodied and living in human beings they had the vert they had the divine nature you know what they were they were kindly affectionate one to another brother Matt come on get back to all that you know the power of the Holy Ghost and raising the dead and speaking in tongues and just casting out demon spirits you got to have all of it because we've been restored to all of it brother random says I'd rather have love in a body than any gift in the church and he says because with gifts there'll be misunderstanding with gifts they'll bring confusion but with perfect love perfect love will bring perfect gifts quote what did the first church have brother Matt the first church had the gifts of the Spirit in operation in their local churches they had Faith he said what is Faith it's a gift of the spirit I don't have any I don't speak in tongues what do you have faith this is a gift of the spirit wisdom the gift of wisdom this is First Corinthians to some the gift of faith the others the gift of wisdom the gift of knowledge the gift of speaking in tongues the gift of interpretation of tongues prophecy the gift of healing the gifts of healing this is part of the body this is First Corinthians this is your inheritance this is what was restored this is what's available this is what's to you this morning this is what you can have right now the gift of healing the working of Miracles I'm reading to you right from the Bible this is what the first church had the working of Miracles the gift of Prophecy the gift of the discernment of spirits this is what the first church had then what is our expectation for our churches it should be the same thing the only gift that operates should not be the gift that operates behind a Pulpit on Wednesdays at seven and Sundays at 11. that's a sad thing what a cold stale what a unhealthy Church what a breeding ground for unhealthy spiritual lives if the only gift is the sage on the stage or the man that's got the word he brings God in his briefcase and he packs it and then he carries it and everyone just sits and listens and absorbs what a what a what a far cry as brother random says when a Far Cry of what the Apostle Paul said when all come together all participate in spiritual I should get allowed amen they had he said brother Matt that's wonderful they had all the gifts you know what else they had they had the fruits of the spirit they had this fruit of love they had the fruit of joy that's a fruit that's for you and if you need it today just reach a hold of it and grab it and take a bite out of it because it's a fruit for you if you don't have joy this morning God can give it to you right now it's available to you right now can you say Amen the fruit of Peace the fruit of the long-suffering the fruit of gentleness that's a fruit of the spirit the fruit of gentleness the fruit of goodness the fruit of Faith the fruit of meekness the fruit of temperance which means control you say brother Matt what did the church have they had all the gifts of the Spirit operating they had all the manifestations of the fruits of the spirit in their lives they didn't miss let me say it this way if we made your own one and leave out any other we sell ourselves short of the full word that's been released to the bride in this generation some cut out emotion others cut out teaching some cut out dancing others cut out brotherly love some cut out tapes others cut out preachers do you see what's happening here let's cut out one and keep the other it's cut out one and keep the other some cut out love some cut out tapes others cut out preaching some cut out the message entirely others just cut out the Bible some cut out repentance others just cut out Grace entirely do you realize it's the tactic of the devil to push us into ditches it's always the tactic of the enemy to get us to Major on minors and minor own Majors to always push us to one side to make us one against the other but let me just say this I want all of it I want all of it I don't just want how many with me can say I don't just want a part of it I want all of it this morning I want everything God wanted to give us I want to say let me receive it Lord let me live so holy let me live so righteous but let me love my brother let me love love for my sister let me have care for one another let me be kindly affectionate one to another brother Brandon says what was their promise I'm going to close God said our restored is going to restore it how he says the word let me let me look at this this is another promise for this generation a Revival I you know let me just stop and say this I should be able to come up to this pulpit and just read these quotes and I should have the attention and the focus of everybody this should be you it's it's incredible to me sometimes a preacher could come with wonderful and man you you come with some of the big things some amazing that everyone's that wants a feel-good message they want to be encouraged that's all good that's all wonderful but this is what we should be attracted to right here let me say nothing and let me re read this and it will stir the bride of Christ if this doesn't move you nothing will is that all right this morning listen to me young people this is what you should be feeding on every day not Instagram and Tick Tock and Facebook and all those things they have maybe that there's a part of that but you should feel a part of your day and feel your real void this is what really fills the void this is what really fills the emptiness right here I think sometimes we get into such an anemic condition because we don't feed upon the message of the hour enough thank you Lord a Revival notice what brother random says his promise this is the presence of God unrecognized a Revival to my opinion doesn't consist of bringing new members a Revival doesn't consist of a bunch of convergence although those things go along with the Revival but a Revival is to revive what you already got it just to get them revived the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there has been no Revival no manifestation of God to stir the bride but we're looking for it there's the expectation it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again say brother matter we waiting on that no it's already happened he will send it he promised it now watch he was dead let the word this is another place let the word of God have preeminence how many can say that I want to let you have it Lord that's what we need a Revival wash all the unbelief out wash it Lord every single bit of it let a Revival so stir me I may not speak in tongues but I might I might not dance but I might I might not shout but I might but let me make sure you do this wash out all the unbelief and all the bugs and all the superstitions let them all come out of me Lord let a word Revival come so strong to this church that it wipes out every bug and every Superstition and all the unbelief in the building that's what Revival we need that's what a Revival's for I think that it's time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die parents you want to know what to strive for church you want to know what to fight for don't ever let the spirit of Revival die we've got to keep a keeping Revival constantly revive every day not just at the next Youth Camp not Bethel Youth Camp 2022 in 2023 or the octar the meetings that we have in this church that shouldn't be your only Revival you should live in Revival every day and say I want to die again today Lord today is a new day revive me again Lord Jesus we must never let that Revival die within us we've got to apply the token you say I love what brother random says there he says it's not something new it's not something new you know everyone's looking for something far off somewhere way off you say brother Matt where I'm at right now all of this is wonderful let me just preach to you can I have about five minutes say brother the man all this wonderful I believe it all but oh you just don't you don't see my you don't see my current condition you don't see where I'm currently at where I'm you got to be real with the people brother Matt right now you don't understand where I'm at right now in this moment in the month of September you don't see all of the all of the different layers that complicate my life and complicate my family and complicate my situation I I don't even I see all that and I believe all that and I look I I accept all that but but how do I get from where I'm at currently to where you're preaching way way over here how do I how do I get to that Revival brother Brandon says it's not it's not bringing something new it's stirring what you already have you know what you have to do you have to learn and I'm preaching to myself here today right with you you know what you have to do rather than being discouraged about your current condition I don't care if it's your health your money your job your your family your your marriage your home no matter what it is spiritual condition you're wherever you're at your prayer life where you estimate yourself to be in the in the in the in the scale of the spectrum of close to God or far away from God I don't care where you feel like I'm preaching this to every human being in this building I don't care where you think you fall or where you're at in that Spectrum let me tell you what we've got to start doing we've got to learn to start where you are now what you have to do is start don't look for what's down the road don't it's so insurmountable how am I ever going to get there I'm preaching to you and have the right expectation you've got to start where you're standing you've got to start where but where I'm standing is a mess brother Matt you haven't seen it start where you're standing no matter where you're at currently everyone's looking for something way off in the distance to happen I our expectation is oh well brother Matt when this happens and you know if this happens and this pans out you know then then things might work out I heard a statement I read it the other they're so powerful it said large doors swing on small hinges large doors you might need a big door open today but just a little small hinge of faith if you start with just a little bit of faith and commit that to God watch that large door swing open and don't take the Great and the Fantastic it just takes a little bit of common faith brother Brandon said just a little kiss of Just a Little Bit of Faith and you have to start where you're standing you say brother Matt what does that mean don't wait to start till things get better start right now so right now remember brother Caleb preached out at our Bible study about Nehemiah when Ezra when they came back to the to the temple it was in ruined and destruction it was destroyed and tattered and ruined you know what they did they got discouraged this is unbelievable we we wanted to come back we came back from Babylon we wanted to rebuild this Temple but my goodness it's it's covered over by weeds you ever seen a house that hasn't been inhabited for 30 years a property that hasn't you can almost unrecognize that the shingles are torn off and animals are growing are living in the house not growing animals are living in the house weeds are growing in the windows the the the the the the the grass is is you know over top of the over top of the uh of the cars everything's just dilapidated you know what happens all that energy on the way there to work and we're going to restore we're going to build this thing you see it you go whoa I don't know about this and this is exactly what happens when they come back to the temple and they say listen Ezra we were all for rebuilding the temple but I mean this is this is insurmountable and the Bible says they become so discouraged they worked for a little bit worked for work for a little while and then after some time because of persecution and that just became the task became insurmountable you work on something old and it's just finally like to a point you're like you know what I I don't think is it even worth it can we even turn it around but hagiah comes to them and haggai says don't despise the day of small things don't look at a little bit of work as nothing you say then what do we got to do haggy I just pick up your hammer that's all you got to do you just gotta start don't look at the insurmountable just start going to work start doing something pick up your shovels don't look at the task in front of you look at the vision of a perfect Temple look at the vision of a of what what you're going to don't look at your current situation keep where God's bringing you to always for you I'm going to start when I when things get different say brother Matt how do I get out of here how do I go forward it's impossible what's in what you don't understand it's well it's impossible what's in front of me Giants are in front of me mountains are in front of me it's impossible it's a race it's a raging River I don't even have I don't have any big tools I don't have anything use what you got in your hand use what God's already given you everyone's looking for something God if you just give me this God's already given you something to whip the Devil he's already given you something to destroy the works of the devil in your home and in your life and in your mind you've got to learn to use what you've already got don't look for something new don't look for something better you've got the better you've already got it little David use what's inside of your hand don't look for a tank don't look for a missile don't look for a rocket use that slingshot you got in your hand use that little Stone that's laying right beside you what's common to you what's right now use that little bit of faith and go to working that thing around and your Goliath will fall you know shamgar and limited resources didn't have nothing shamgar didn't have much of nothing an ox goat his his resources were limited his options were very few odds the odds were stacked against him entirely 600 demon spirits would come to his family 600 demon Spirits I want you to look at them that way because you're you're living in Satan's Eden and whether you recognize it or not there's armies of demons that are trying to assault your family and your home and your job and your children they're trying everything they can to destroy and to cause confusion and to cause chaos 600 demons would come to Sham guard's family and you know what they would take everything he had and he didn't have much take all of his food had no way to feed his family you know what happened to shamgar one day I'm going to make it very simple we've preached on this a hundred times I'm going to make it very simple because I want it to be simple for you to realize what it took for shamgar to build enough Faith to pick up an ox go to slay all 600 demons you know what happened to shamgar one day he realized I'm on my farm this is my house this is my wife and that's my children this is my land and the devil's invading and taking everything he got because he's a thief and he's a robber he comes to steal kill and destroy and Sam Garr said I may not have much but I'm gonna start right where I'm standing I'm going to take what I already got and I'm gonna go to work on the devil in my life I'm not going to wait for the big and fantastic I'm not going to wait for Revival I'm going to say Lord stir up what you've already put inside of me you mean brother Matty didn't sit down and think of a game plan he didn't go four or five steps six steps to per you know to Restoration and this is how you heal your marriage and this is how you heal this and this is you go through all these 14 steps he didn't blueprint all this game plan didn't get with generals and of I know he didn't have any he didn't get there and prepare tanks okay when they come over here on the Left Flank we're gonna have an army over here and and you know I he didn't have any of that there was no plan there was no even thinking about it he heard the sound of the enemy coming and you know what he did he made a choice I'm gonna fight today and then he said I'm going to use what I've already got because God told me the miracle is not what's coming the miracle is what you already have in your hand the miracle that you're waiting for is already available to you right how many will accept that say Lord you've already promised it the Miracles already what you say what was it all that he had Moses what did he use he used what was in his hand he used the staff threw it on the ground and they consumed the other snakes what was it it wasn't looking for a missile or an AR-15 or a rocket launcher he used what he already had in his hand and what he had in his hand was more than enough to defeat the Devil in his life let me say this God put something in your hand young person you may feel like you're the Biggest Loser weakling you know why you might feel that way because I feel that way a lot may feel like you're the Biggest Loser can't whip the devil just get beat up never win any battles you may feel like nothing today may feel like you need let me just stop and say you have everything you need to whip the devil don't look for something off in the future wait for some fantastic God's already put it in your hand you just got to use what you got you've got to Avail yourself of the resource God's already given you oh that's for somebody here today stop looking at what you don't have and look at what's right in your hand you may only have just a little microscopic under a microscope maybe if I you know maybe if we could just magnify it oh no make it bigger magnify larger put it in the James Webb Telescope and then you'd see a little grain of faith might feel that way this morning for the man I might have a little microscopic grain of Faith but let me say this start with what you have say Lord I'm going to start right here I'm going to stop letting the devil whip me I'm going to close I think that it's time listen what brother Brandon says here apply it this is the token musicians could you come apply it create that atmosphere around you let me I don't want to skip this this is a promise this is a promise Mom it's a promise Dad it's a promised Church something that's

what is the token brother Matt what is the token brother Branham the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost not a blood not a chemistry but it's the holy spirit of God that's the token that God requires of the church a day God must see young purple young person old person no matter who you are God must see the token he must see it in every one of us God's requiring a token that you yourself have received his token and the Holy Ghost that's the talk it's the only way it's the only sign that God will ever pass because it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the bow your heads with me if you could ever hit bad ever I closed Lord Jesus here we stop lord believing that you've said what you've wanted to say this morning I know Lord that it's a good word I know it's just what the doctor ordered if we could only now just apply it to our life we can only now just accept it May there may there be someone here this morning Lord that listens maybe on live stream or archive or those that are present here in this building Lord there's someone here that you've been speaking directly to speaking and dealing with and everything Lord that you've said today Lord I pray that they would be able to break past the barrier of doubt break past the barrier of tradition break past the barrier of unbelief for lord it's the devil's job to do everything he can to try to pluck away that which you've tried to plant Lord you you gave the example of the seed that falls on the Wayside and some falls on Estonian some falls on thorny and that ground that fall fell on Lord it was ground that was fallow ground it was hardened it was it received the seed but it couldn't take no root there was too much in the way the Bible says that birds came the fowls of the air and just came and plucked it up took what you planted I pray God that today you'd break the ground this morning may you break the Stony heart may you break that fallow ground up may you break past every barrier Lord that the devil puts upon our life every fear every complex let him look past Lord this morning the badger skin let them put look past the veil of Flesh wasn't brother Matt wasn't for the man who preached the sermon and said some things alike some things I didn't like some things I greeted some things I didn't agree with wasn't brother Matt Lord that's all people get from it this morning it'll do them no good but if we can recognize the voice of Our Shepherd we could recognize the voice of our friend who's like no other friend we could recognize that voice that calms all storms that answers all questions that removes all doubt that that voice that speaks and when you speak Lord when your voice contacts our heart Lord it breaks through all unbelief it breaks through every barrier it brings a peace that passes understanding I just raised my hand and say Lord let your voice let it whisper into the ear of your daughter this morning let it whisper into the ear of your son Lord let that voice that still Small Voice that spoke dealt with her heart that warned them that encouraged them that admonish them that rebuked them that rescued Lord a voice of redemption a voice of rescue whatever it was to them today I pray God that you'd break past every barrier there'd be someone here today Lord we still we read we heard about it today Lord the promise that's been made available to us not just to a church Lord May that individual May that young person under the sound of my voice may they realize this is your promise this is your book you've got to go up and take it you've got to go and grab a hold of it no one's going to hand it to you no one's gonna give it to you you've got to go and claim it oh as John claimed it from the angel hand of the Angel young person you've got to go and reach a hold of it with faith take it take it for yourself it'll defeat every demon it'll defeat every struggle you're dealing with it'll defeat every doubt it'll defeat Every Lie oh it'll defeat every enemy every struggle every trial that you're in it'll it'll it'll hit its mark may they realize it this morning lord it's for them as I stop here on this quote Lord about the token even you Lord did that I didn't do that Lord may they realize lord it's what you're requiring today you're not requiring Conformity to Traditions or rules regulations you're not requiring a dress code you're not requiring something to repeat Lord that's not what you're requiring you're just requiring a heart that could surrender and raise a hand and say I want it Lord I wanted Jesus I want it in my life oh hands up going up all over the building sincere hearts I want it this morning I'm tired of hearing about it I'm tired of just thinking about it hearing it preached I wanted for me Lord I want to say I want the real thing I don't want a church tradition I don't want an emotional workup I don't want any like an intellectual gospel or understanding I want the real thing to come and and change my life from the inside out I believe God can do it for you it's here for you you just got to receive it has got to receive it this morning help hearts Lord I Lift both of my hands up this morning I left both of my hands with these people and I say Lord give me the faith to start right where I'm standing stop looking at the ruins stop looking at how far away I am let me set the right expectation the expectation is not what I see right now but what you're doing in my life I want to raise a hand and say I believe I confess you're working in my life whether I feel like it Lord you're working for my benefit you're working on behalf of my family you're working on behalf of this church Lord I just want to confess you're working in my life and I accept it Lord whatever you want to do in my home I accepted Jesus I Surrender right now to it Lord I'm going to start where I'm standing I'm going to take what I've got in my hand I'm going to fight the devil right now how many would stand to their feet and say I choose I choose to be shamgar I'm going to stand to my feet and say I'm going to take what's already in my hand I'm not going to look for the fantastic I'm going to take that little bit of faith that I've got and say Lord little as much when God is in it I'm gonna take a little bit of common faith not trying to work it up just common faith belief in your word I'm going to accept it for me granted Lord I pray that Jacobs would die today Israel would be born I pray Lord that Jacob would stop his struggle he would come to a place to where he could say I'm not leaving this church until I'm changed I'm not leaving until I know I've been touched I'm not leaving until I've got a new name I pray we'd have that kind of desperation that determination in our homes to say I'm not leaving till the fruits of Christ to the manifestation of the gifts to the manifestation of the spirit to the fullness of the inheritance of the word that was promised until I've accepted it till I've laid down every bit of doubt I want to lay it down right now how many could say Lord I'm laying it down I'm casting down all doubt I'm casting out all skepticism I'm casting out all criticism I'm casting it out of my mind right now it's not what I think it's what your word is already spoken you're requiring it Lord you're requiring it today oh but you promised you made a
