[0:00] Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[0:01] Lord this morning.
[0:02] Amen.
[0:04] Exodus 23 and verse 20. It says,
[0:06] "Behold, I send an angel before thee to
[0:08] keep thee in the way and to bring thee
[0:11] in the place which I have prepared.
[0:13] Beware of him and obey his voice,
[0:15] provoke him not, for he will not pardon
[0:17] your transgressions, for not for my name
[0:19] is in him. But if thou shalt indeed obey
[0:23] his voice, and do all that I speak, then
[0:26] I will be an enemy unto thine enemies,
[0:28] and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
[0:31] For mine angel shall go before thee, and
[0:34] bring thee in unto the Amorites, the
[0:36] Hittites, the Preszites, and the
[0:39] Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the
[0:40] Jebusites, and I will cut them off. So
[0:43] they had all these enemies, and he said,
[0:44] I will cut them off. He says, 'Thou
[0:46] shalt not bow down to their gods, nor
[0:49] serve them, nor do after their works,
[0:51] but thou shalt utterly overthrow them
[0:53] and quite break down their images, and
[0:55] ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he
[0:58] shall bless thy bread and thy waters,
[0:59] and I will take sickness away from the
[1:01] midst of thee. There shall nothing cast
[1:03] their young, nor barren in thy land. The
[1:06] number of thy days I will fulfill. I
[1:08] will send my fear before thee, and I
[1:10] will destroy all the people to whom thou
[1:13] shalt come. And I will make all thine
[1:16] enemies turn their backs unto thee.
[1:19] And I will send hornets before thee, and
[1:21] shall drive out the Hivites, the
[1:22] Canaanites, the Hittites before thee.
[1:24] And I will drive them out from before
[1:26] thee in one year, lest the land become
[1:29] desolate, and the beasts of the field
[1:31] multiply against thee. Verse 30 it says,
[1:34] "But by little and little I will drive
[1:37] them out from before thee until thou be
[1:40] increased and inherit the land little by
[1:44] little, saints, little by little. And I
[1:46] will set bounds from the Red Sea and
[1:48] under the sea of the Philistines, and
[1:49] from the desert unto the river, and I
[1:51] will deliver the inhabitants of the land
[1:53] into your hand, and thou shalt drive
[1:54] them out before thee. Thou shalt make no
[1:57] covenant with them, nor with their gods.
[1:59] They shall not dwell in thy land, lest
[2:01] they make thee sin against me. For if
[2:03] thou shalt serve their gods, it will be
[2:06] a surely be a snare unto thee. So, one
[2:09] more portion of scripture. We're going
[2:10] to turn over into 1st Samuel 17.
[2:14] Going to do a little parallel here. 1st
[2:15] Samuel 17 and:e 31. And when the words
[2:18] were heard which David spake, they
[2:20] rehearsed them before Saul, and he sent
[2:22] for them. And David said to Saul, "Let
[2:24] no man's heart fail because of him. thy
[2:27] servant will go and fight with the
[2:28] Philistine. And Saul said to David, Thou
[2:30] art not able to go against the
[2:32] Philistines to fight with him, for thou
[2:34] art but a youth, and he a man from his
[2:36] youth. And David said unto Saul, thy
[2:38] servant, thy servant kept his father's
[2:41] sheep. Now look here there. And there
[2:43] came a lion and a bear and took a lamb
[2:46] out of the flock, and I went out after
[2:48] him, and smokeote him, and delivered it
[2:50] out of his mouth. And when he arose
[2:52] against me, I caught him by his beard,
[2:54] and smokeote him, and slew him. Thy
[2:57] servant slew both the lion and the bear.
[2:59] And this uncircumcised Philistine shall
[3:01] be as one of them, seeing he hath defied
[3:04] the armies of the living God. So he had
[3:08] a commission to be a Goliath slayer,
[3:10] just like each one of us do, to be a
[3:12] giant slayer, but he had to slay those
[3:14] lions and those bears in his life first.
[3:16] So I want to take a little bit of
[3:18] thought um by the help of the Lord this
[3:19] morning. Um, little by little, let's go
[3:22] before the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[3:25] we're so thankful for the reading of
[3:26] your word this morning. Father, we're
[3:28] thankful just to be able to come into
[3:29] your house, Lord God, and just worship
[3:32] you today, Lord. I pray over the Sunday
[3:34] school. I pray you'd anoint the ears to
[3:35] hear. I pray that you'd anoint your
[3:37] speaker, Lord, for the main service,
[3:39] Lord, be with us all this morning. We
[3:41] ask all these things now in the name of
[3:43] Jesus. Amen. You may be seated tonight.
[3:46] Towards the word or towards the world.
[3:48] It's, you know, it's just one letter
[3:50] difference. Our second opening scripture
[3:52] there in 1 Samuel, the Lord anointed
[3:54] David to be that giant slayer. And like
[3:57] I said, he anointed each one of us to to
[3:59] do the very same thing, for that same
[4:01] task. But he never asked you to start
[4:03] with that. He he had he started with
[4:06] David in his home life. He started in
[4:08] training him to to to be a shepherd.
[4:11] Training him to take care of his sheep,
[4:13] training him to to slay the lions in his
[4:16] own life, slay the bears in his own
[4:18] life. You know, the beast was trying to
[4:19] devour his family's livestock. And
[4:22] you'll notice that those victories that
[4:24] David won, they were won alone. They
[4:26] were fought alone. And he, just to type
[4:29] the natural and the spiritual here, he
[4:30] slayed those carnal things in his life.
[4:32] He has submitted to the word of God in
[4:34] his personal life. And he was able to
[4:37] yield those things that maybe hindering
[4:40] hinder you in your daily walk. He was
[4:42] able to yield those worldly
[4:43] entertainments so that he could tend to
[4:46] his sheep. Amen. So that's how we win
[4:49] victories in our life, protecting one
[4:51] sheep at a time, little by little,
[4:54] right? We take one thought captive at a
[4:56] time. We remove one hindrance in our
[4:59] personal life at a time. And then one
[5:01] day when a Goliath does come up and try
[5:03] to defy the armies of the living God,
[5:05] we're now trained and prepared to slay
[5:08] that enemy. Because in our personal
[5:10] life, in our home life, in our Mondays
[5:12] and Tuesdays and Wednesdays and
[5:14] Thursdays when we have to get up and we
[5:15] have to, you know, fight the, you know,
[5:17] the laziness of life, we have to
[5:20] actually put effort into reading our
[5:22] Bible and we have to put effort into
[5:24] coming to church on a Wednesday night
[5:25] and those things. When we can actually
[5:27] tend to those sheep in our life, then
[5:29] when those things do come, you're
[5:31] trained and you're prepared to fight
[5:33] against those enemies. Amen. And then
[5:36] you're anointed. You're prepared. You're
[5:38] anointed with the revelation from God
[5:40] like David was in this. He said, "I had
[5:43] I know I can defeat this enemy because I
[5:46] defeated him already. I've already
[5:48] defeated a lion. I've already defeated a
[5:49] bear." We have these victories, these
[5:51] small victories in our in our life. You
[5:53] know, I I did cast down that vain
[5:55] imagination. So if I took that thought
[5:57] and and that word of God, then I can
[5:59] take every word of God because that's
[6:01] that's what the scripture is. We take
[6:03] every word. We punctuate every word with
[6:04] an amen. Right? The Lord's command there
[6:07] at the beginning of Exodus 23, it was
[6:10] commanded that the Lord were were given
[6:11] a land as an inheritance. They were
[6:14] promised that it was going to be their
[6:15] land. And yet they still needed to
[6:17] possess it. So, Exodus 23 and 24, it
[6:20] says, "You shall not bow down to their
[6:22] gods, nor serve them, nor do according
[6:24] to their works, but you shall utterly
[6:26] overthrow them and completely break down
[6:28] their sacred pillars." So, there was
[6:30] obviously a reason that the Lord had
[6:33] commanded them to utterly overthrow them
[6:34] and completely drive down their pillars.
[6:36] He was seeing the potential of what
[6:38] would happen if they didn't follow that
[6:40] word and began to intermingle with those
[6:43] things of the world, begin to
[6:44] intermingle with those those enemies.
[6:48] So, Judges 1. Judges 1. If we t turn
[6:51] into our Bibles, Judges chapter 1. Well,
[6:55] we can just go through this. You can
[6:56] leave that up. Okay. Judges 1 and verse
[6:58] 16. And it says, um, "And the children
[7:01] of the Kennites, Moses, his
[7:02] father-in-law, went up out of the city
[7:03] of the palm trees. And the children of
[7:05] Judah went into the wilderness of Judah,
[7:07] which lith in the south of Aad.
[7:11] and Judah went with Simeon his brother
[7:13] and they slew the Canaanites and
[7:14] inhabited Zapath and utterly destroyed
[7:17] it and the name of that city was called
[7:19] Horma. So the there in judges they had
[7:21] their command and now it came time to to
[7:24] possess that land and Judah started off
[7:27] right. It says that they utterly
[7:28] destroyed it and seemingly it's it was
[7:32] okay. They had a good start, but then
[7:34] little by little, each tribe that goes,
[7:36] and we're going to catch it here in a
[7:37] few minutes, but each tribe began to let
[7:39] a little bit more of the enemy in their
[7:40] life. They allowed the enemy to be their
[7:42] tributaries, which were their slaves.
[7:44] They allowed a little bit more carnality
[7:46] in their life. And little by little,
[7:48] they started moving in the wrong
[7:50] direction.
[7:50] Amen.
[7:52] You know, if we're not careful, just to
[7:54] bring this back to our daily life, if
[7:56] we're not careful, those little by
[7:57] littles can start to move us in the
[7:59] opposite direction. You know, and we
[8:01] watch they started disobeying the word
[8:03] of God, but in a subtle way. They they
[8:05] made those enemies tributaries instead
[8:07] of utterly destroying them. The command
[8:09] was utterly destroy them. Don't, you
[8:11] know, don't utterly make them your
[8:13] tributaries. Don't utterly allow them a
[8:15] little bit in your life. Don't, you
[8:16] know, yeah, there's women and there's
[8:18] children and there's baby. Utterly
[8:20] destroy that enemy in their life because
[8:21] those women and those children are going
[8:23] to raise up and they're going to have
[8:25] they're they're the enemies of God. And
[8:27] so God would see that later down the
[8:29] road that would be a hindrance in their
[8:31] life. The transition we'll read here um
[8:35] here in just a minute. It was it was
[8:37] really subtle. Um Judges 1 and verse 20,
[8:42] it says we're just going to kind of go
[8:45] through through some scriptures here. So
[8:47] Judges chapter 1 verse 20. And they gave
[8:49] he brought unto Caleb as Moses said, and
[8:51] he expelled then the three sons of Anch,
[8:53] the children of Benj Benjamin, and did
[8:55] not drive out the Jebisites that
[8:57] inhabited Jerusalem. But the Jebisites,
[8:59] which were the enemy, dwell with the
[9:02] children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto
[9:04] this day. So we're just going to watch
[9:06] the trend here that takes place. In
[9:07] verse 27, if you want to skip down to
[9:09] verse 27, neither did Manasseh drive out
[9:11] the inhabitants and her towns, nor the
[9:14] inhabitants of Door, nor the inhabitants
[9:15] of Iblam, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo
[9:18] and her towns, but the Canaanites, the
[9:19] enemy would dwell in her land. Now
[9:21] verses 28, and it came to pass when
[9:23] Israel was strong, they put the
[9:25] Canaanites to tribute, but did not
[9:28] utterly drive them out. Verses 29,
[9:31] um, neither did Ephraim drive out the
[9:34] Canaanites in Gazer, but the Canaanites
[9:35] dwell in Gazer. Uh verses 30, but the
[9:38] Canaanites dwelt among them and became
[9:39] tributary Zebulun.
[9:42] Now watch the transition here. Verses 31
[9:45] it says, "Neither did Asher drive out
[9:47] the inhabitants of Ako, nor the
[9:48] inhabitants of Zidon, Ablab, Axib,
[9:51] Heblab, Afic, nor Reeb, Rehab. But the
[9:55] Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites,
[9:57] the inhabitants of the land, for they
[9:59] did not drive them out." So now you see
[10:01] the Asherites were now dwelling among
[10:03] the enemy's territory. So it started off
[10:05] now they were the enemies had a little
[10:07] bit of leeway in their territory but now
[10:09] you see that now we're on the enemy's
[10:11] territory and it wasn't some great big
[10:13] monumental explosion that happened in
[10:15] the scripture like it was just one
[10:17] little verse and it the wording of it
[10:19] and it just changed just a little bit
[10:20] because they allowed just a little bit
[10:21] of leeway. Now, they were living on the
[10:23] enemy's land. And before we know it,
[10:26] little by little, if you don't if you
[10:28] don't take those thoughts captive, if
[10:30] you don't if you don't exercise the word
[10:31] of God and be obedient in every word of
[10:33] God, then little by little, those things
[10:35] can just become become inhabitants in
[10:38] your land and eventually overtake your
[10:40] land.
[10:41] So, and the transition there, you know,
[10:44] the devil is subtle and he's deceiving.
[10:47] So, he uses those subtleties. And then
[10:50] in verse 33, if you want to go to 33,
[10:52] but he dwelt, neither did Nefali, that
[10:55] tribe, but he dwelt among the
[10:56] Canaanites. But he dwelt among the
[10:59] Canaanites and the inhabitants of the
[11:01] land. So now, now they're dwelling among
[11:03] the enemy's land. So before they knew
[11:06] it, they were completely and totally out
[11:08] of the will of God, living a backsliden
[11:10] life. They quit going to church. They
[11:12] quit fellowshipping with believers. They
[11:14] quit listening to tapes. And for a while
[11:16] they were still even claiming to be
[11:18] followers of God. And then little by
[11:20] little as that generation began to die
[11:22] out, they found themselves worshiping
[11:23] pagan gods, living as slave to other
[11:25] other countries. And then if you read
[11:26] the book of Judges, you know, it's this
[11:28] perpetual cycle that they would raise up
[11:30] a a godly God would raise up a judge,
[11:33] deliver them, and then they'd go back
[11:34] into their sin. And it was just a cycle.
[11:36] And you know, before you know it, you
[11:38] can find yourself in that cycle in your
[11:41] Christian walk like the Israelites were
[11:42] there in Judges. You let the do you let
[11:45] the world in a little bit. You let you
[11:46] know you're living a little carnally.
[11:48] We're not reading our Bibles every day.
[11:50] You know, you're not your prayer life
[11:51] starts slipping. You're not listening to
[11:52] the prophet. You use any free time that
[11:55] we can for entertainment. And then you
[11:57] find yourself so far from God
[11:59] spiritually worshiping these idols in
[12:01] our life. And you know, at least in the
[12:03] Old Testament, it was blatant idol
[12:05] worship. But nowadays, it's so
[12:07] deceiving. You know, the devil's going
[12:09] to pat you on the back and say, "You're
[12:11] not backslid. you're, you know, you're
[12:13] you're going to church every Sunday.
[12:14] You're, you know, you may get some
[12:16] Wednesdays into there and and you're,
[12:18] you know, you're doing okay, but you
[12:20] know, you look the part, but it's about
[12:22] what's in your heart. And God looks at
[12:24] what's in your heart. Amen.
[12:26] And then, you know, you come back to
[12:28] your senses, you repent, you promise God
[12:30] we'll do better. And I'm just, you know,
[12:32] this is not preaching at you. I'm
[12:33] preaching to me. You know, you you
[12:35] promise God you'll do better. And then
[12:36] little by little, it happens again and
[12:39] again. And it becomes that cycle where
[12:42] the Israelites were in the book of
[12:43] Judges. And I really, I don't know about
[12:45] y'all, but I don't want my walk with the
[12:47] Lord to look like that. I, you know, I
[12:49] want to be a victor. I want to have a
[12:51] victorious Christian walk in in the
[12:53] Lord. I want to I want to wake up every
[12:55] morning and, you know, I know I'm going
[12:56] to have some thoughts. I'm taking those
[12:57] thoughts captive. I know it's going to
[12:59] be a struggle to wake up 10, 15, 20
[13:01] minutes earlier than I do and read the
[13:02] Bible and and pray. And I know that
[13:04] those things are are going to take a
[13:06] conscious effort. But I want to do those
[13:08] things so that when it comes time to
[13:10] face those Goliaths in my life, I have
[13:12] now won the lions and the bears that
[13:16] have tried to take my sheep, tried to
[13:18] take those little things in my life.
[13:20] Amen.
[13:22] Our victories and are fought and they're
[13:24] won in the trenches of the Monday
[13:27] mornings when Sunday's passed and you're
[13:29] not in the presence of other believers
[13:31] anymore. when you wake up from the with
[13:33] the pressures of life and and they hit
[13:35] you like a a brick wall. When you're
[13:37] driving to work and you make the choice
[13:39] to listen to the prophet rather than
[13:40] some entertainment. um you know when
[13:43] you're at work or or something and you
[13:45] know someone walks by that isn't dressed
[13:46] the way they should be and you know you
[13:49] consciously take that that thought
[13:50] captive and you bring it into the
[13:52] obedience of God and you honor God by
[13:54] turning your head um when you get home
[13:57] and maybe there's a t tense atmosphere
[13:59] because you know the kids were you know
[14:01] not feeling good or or there's just
[14:03] pressures going on but then you make the
[14:05] effort to to read your Bible and pray
[14:07] with your family. Those are the
[14:09] victories that are won on a as shepherds
[14:13] for our sheep, saints. Those are the
[14:15] victories that, you know, we take them
[14:16] to the trenches. So then when we when we
[14:19] have need of something, you know, we oh,
[14:22] you know, I I I'm in the will of God
[14:24] because I'm walking in his will. I'm
[14:26] walking at the best I can to walk. Amen.
[14:30] You know, sometimes, you know, you can
[14:32] feel victorious on a Sunday morning. you
[14:34] know, some, you know, you hear a good
[14:36] sermon Wednesday night, you hear a good
[14:37] sermon. When we're in the presence of
[14:39] the Lord, you know, when we hear the
[14:40] word going forth, you know, or as a body
[14:42] of believers, we're we're lifting up our
[14:44] voices and we hear, you know, the
[14:46] singing and that drives back the evil
[14:48] spirits. But you know, the reason that
[14:50] the Lord allows us to have those
[14:52] precious moments is so that we can take
[14:54] those messages of victory and take those
[14:57] things to our Monday mornings and to our
[14:59] Tuesday mornings and to our to our
[15:01] Thursday afternoons so that we can
[15:04] really have victory in the trenches.
[15:05] Amen.
[15:07] And really apply those words to our
[15:10] everyday life. You know, maybe pause
[15:13] some kind of entertainment so that we
[15:15] can listen to a tape. You know, it's not
[15:16] always an easy choice. Um you know it's
[15:20] living in you know a leady to see an
[15:22] hour it's just you don't it's not that
[15:24] you don't want to do it it's just that
[15:27] you know you just want to relax for a
[15:28] while is you know just bringing it down
[15:30] to the carnality of things you just want
[15:31] you just you don't think about it but I
[15:33] promise you if you start making those
[15:35] conscious choices to do that in in your
[15:39] everyday walk then little by little
[15:41] you'll start gaining more strength
[15:43] little by little you'll get more
[15:44] revelation by little you'll be more on
[15:47] fire for the word of God. That's what
[15:50] our kids need to see in us. You know, I
[15:52] want my little girl to grow up and I
[15:53] want her to see her dad on fire for the
[15:55] word of God. You know, on fire for the
[15:57] message of the hour. You know, this is
[15:59] an amazing message. It's still the same
[16:02] message that it was 75 years ago. It's,
[16:04] you know, it's greater. We're coming
[16:05] into our maturity now. This is this is
[16:07] an amazing thing. you know, screaming
[16:09] amen when the, you know, the preacher
[16:11] says something amazing or or just
[16:13] dancing and shouting when our pastor's
[16:15] pouring out his heart to us so that we
[16:17] can live a better Christian life. And
[16:19] um, you know, my wife, she she probably
[16:24] thinks I'm crazy, but she might be used
[16:26] to it now. Sometimes I'll just get so
[16:27] excited about something that the Lord
[16:29] just revealed to me and and I'll just
[16:30] start jumping up and praising the Lord
[16:32] just in in the house and, you know, our
[16:35] little baby's kind of like, "Oh, what's
[16:36] what's going on?" You know, but as my
[16:39] girls grow up, I want them to know that,
[16:42] you know, those those kind of things
[16:43] aren't reserved for just preachers or
[16:45] people that have high energy. Those are
[16:47] for the saints of God. Those are for the
[16:49] body of believers. You get excited about
[16:50] the word of God. You let your kids see
[16:52] that you're excited. You let your wife
[16:54] see that you're excited. You let your
[16:55] husband see that you're excited for the
[16:57] will word of God because it's a thrill.
[17:00] It's it's an amazing thing that God God
[17:02] takes one scripture and he can there's
[17:05] so many compound things in just one
[17:07] scripture and he can reveal so many
[17:08] things to you and if you're just looking
[17:10] for it and you're just having the right
[17:11] attitude about it and you're just you're
[17:13] excited about it and those moments of
[17:15] encouragement you know um blessed
[17:19] Matthew 5:6 blessed are those who hunger
[17:21] and thirst for righteousness for they
[17:23] shall be filled there's your promise you
[17:25] will be filled if you're hunger hungry
[17:26] and you're thirsty for righteousness
[17:30] You know, I don't want them to see that
[17:32] that um you know, following Jesus is
[17:34] just some melancholy experience um that
[17:37] we practice maybe on Sundays or
[17:39] Wednesdays. I want them to know that the
[17:41] same God that parted the Red Sea, you
[17:43] know, 4,000 years ago or the same God
[17:46] that, you know, 2,000 years ago
[17:49] resurrected, the same God 75 years ago,
[17:51] that's the same God we serve now. He's
[17:53] the same. Hebrews 13:8 says he's the
[17:55] same God he was then that he is now. And
[17:57] we serve that same God. Amen. And if we
[18:00] just if we treat this message just like
[18:04] it's another thing in our lives, if we
[18:05] treat the word of God like maybe it's a
[18:07] compartment in our lives, that fire can
[18:09] slowly die out through each generation.
[18:11] And that's what happened here. They
[18:12] didn't they didn't uh it says that as as
[18:16] they as the next generation rose up,
[18:18] then they started to backslide because
[18:21] what happened that fire that new
[18:23] generation rose up and it said that they
[18:25] remembered not the Lord. Wow.
[18:28] You know, we're so incredibly
[18:29] privileged. Wow. Uh 10 more minutes. So,
[18:32] we're so incredibly privileged, you
[18:34] know, to see the miracles take place,
[18:36] you know, to see the work of God in our
[18:38] lives. And I just say that let it be
[18:40] high octane fuel so that we can um you
[18:43] know, take those testimonies, take the
[18:45] word and keep that flame kindled. Amen.
[18:47] And if we have those those uh quotes,
[18:50] bring those quotes up here. And you
[18:53] know, we keep those flames kindled and
[18:55] instead of living in the the cycle that
[18:57] the Israelites lived there in the book
[18:58] of Judges, we recognize our position as
[19:01] more than conquerors.
[19:03] As more than conquerors and we walk in
[19:05] that.
[19:07] So the first this first um quote here,
[19:10] Brother Brandham says 1962 pursuing.
[19:12] Now, isn't that just a type of the
[19:13] church today? We can't just do it. Why?
[19:15] I tell you it's it's impossible now. We
[19:18] have become this and we got to be a
[19:20] little like this. And where's the street
[19:22] meetings at anymore? That's true, young
[19:24] fellow. There's there's not very many no
[19:26] more. Where is the all night prayer
[19:28] meetings we used to have? What happened
[19:29] to it? Where's the deep sincerity in
[19:31] pressing on with God? What's the matter?
[19:34] We've been cut away from it. We just
[19:36] laid it little by little. And I just
[19:40] love that quote because brother Brandham
[19:41] looks at the other side of that little
[19:43] by little where um you know what
[19:46] happened to the deep sincerity? What
[19:47] happened to the pressing on? You know,
[19:49] at some point it started heading off in
[19:51] the wrong direction. And now he's
[19:52] talking about the church, but I'm
[19:54] talking about our everyday walk here. We
[19:56] just what happened to that deep
[19:57] sincerity? And and it it doesn't have to
[19:59] be, you know, oh, what happened? And we
[20:01] have to, you know, I don't want anybody
[20:02] to be discouraged by what I'm saying.
[20:04] And I want it to be an encouragement
[20:05] because it can h you can start right now
[20:07] or we can just start walking in the in
[20:09] the right walking walking in the other
[20:11] direction little by little having those
[20:13] victories. Right. Slide the next slide
[20:15] there brother. Um just some quotes we
[20:18] want to go through. The angel of the
[20:20] covenant 1954. Now notice in the 29th
[20:22] verse he he said I will not drive them
[20:25] out in one year unless the beasts of the
[20:27] field multiply against you and come out
[20:30] against you. But little by little, I
[20:32] will drive them out. Just as you're able
[20:34] to possess the land, I'll drive them
[20:36] out. There you are. So, he's not gonna
[20:38] give you everything all at once. He
[20:40] knows we can't handle it like that. So,
[20:42] little by little, he gives you the
[20:43] victory. And little by little, you
[20:45] conquer one enemy. Little by little, you
[20:47] you take one thought captive. Little by
[20:49] little, you protect one sheep in your
[20:51] herd. And then, before you know it,
[20:53] you're conquering Goliath in your life.
[20:57] Don't wait until the prayer starts.
[20:59] Accept it now. If you can move your
[21:01] foot, but you can find out you move your
[21:03] toe. That's all you need. That's right.
[21:05] Little by little, I'll drive every enemy
[21:06] away. Every unbelief before the
[21:08] meeting's over, you can shout and run up
[21:09] and down the floor just as you're able
[21:11] to accept it. That's how I'll drive it
[21:13] out. I'll send my angel before thee.
[21:15] That's what he says in Exodus 23, if we
[21:17] remember that passage. I'll send my
[21:18] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[21:20] way. So keep that in your mind, saints,
[21:23] that you have an angel before thee. That
[21:25] whatever you face, he is already there
[21:28] before thee. He is already there. He's
[21:30] He's setting down the pathway so you can
[21:33] overcome that thing. He's just waiting
[21:35] for you to step into your position. Now
[21:38] the next slide test. This is this is
[21:41] this is amazing. This quote I just have
[21:43] been so encouraged by this quote. And
[21:44] this is testimony raising a dead boy
[21:46] 1953. Now look, God said, "I'm not going
[21:48] to give it to you all at one time. I'll
[21:50] give it to you at if I give it to you at
[21:52] one time. If I do, then you'll the whole
[21:55] land will sweep bear. the wild beasts
[21:57] will multiply against you and will
[21:58] overcome you. I'm just going to give it
[22:00] to you little by little as you're able
[22:02] to possess the land. I'm going to drive
[22:04] them out and give it to you little by
[22:05] little. That's the way God does it
[22:07] tonight. That's the way God does it
[22:09] today. Maybe today you say, "Well, I do
[22:11] feel a little bit better." Well, praise
[22:13] God. We'll take some. We got Canaanites
[22:15] today. We'll take the Amorites tomorrow.
[22:18] See, just as you're able to take it,
[22:20] look at this. God, you might break your
[22:22] neck if you get it all at once. So if we
[22:24] if we take the Goliath before we start
[22:26] slaying those lions and bears in our
[22:28] life, then you know we might break our
[22:31] neck all at once. But God gives you one
[22:33] enemy at a time, one victory at a time.
[22:36] Well, you say, "I couldn't move my hand
[22:37] that much yesterday, but I can move it
[22:39] this much today. Praise the Lord.
[22:40] Tomorrow I'll move it that much." You
[22:42] see, little by little, you'll have it.
[22:44] The next slide he says, "I tell you this
[22:46] in a most marvelous thing that I've ever
[22:48] seen in my life is the greatest hours of
[22:50] my life is when I get up against a wall
[22:52] that I can't get over it, under it, or
[22:54] around it." That's right. When I trust
[22:55] God and he opens up the way and I go
[22:58] through the thing, God takes you through
[23:00] it. And that's when you come out on the
[23:01] other side. It's like Samson when he
[23:03] killed the lion. When he got out on the
[23:05] other side, when he killed the lion, he
[23:06] got the sweetest honey he ever eat out
[23:08] of that old carcass of lion. And
[23:10] sometimes if you'll overcome something
[23:12] by the grace of God, it'll be the
[23:14] sweetest thing that you ever tasted in
[23:16] your life. Isn't that right? If you know
[23:18] what I'm spiritually see speaking of. I
[23:20] love the way the prophet puts that. If
[23:21] you trust God, he opens the way. He
[23:23] killed the lion and then the sweetest
[23:25] honey comes out of that carcass that he
[23:26] ever ate in his whole life. Getting
[23:29] those victories every day in your
[23:30] thought life. Getting those victories,
[23:32] those small victories in your life,
[23:33] slaying those lions and and protecting
[23:35] your sheep. some of the sometimes those
[23:37] are those are the strength that gets you
[23:39] through the Goliath. You think you think
[23:41] back on those little testimonies you had
[23:43] where man I had I I I I couldn't quite
[23:45] overcome this but then by God's grace I
[23:47] overcame it and now man Lord I know you
[23:50] did this for me. I know you can do you
[23:51] can do this for me. Amen. Glory to God.
[23:55] Slide uh the next slide. Actually go to
[23:58] we'll move on to the next uh we'll go to
[24:01] slide six if you can. Well, that's the
[24:03] way God wants us to do it. When you're
[24:05] baptized into the Holy Ghost, that's a
[24:06] good thing. When you become a Christian,
[24:08] good thing. But the thing of it is, you
[24:09] haven't looked around yet to see all the
[24:11] blessings that God got in there. There's
[24:13] divine healing, there's joy, there's
[24:16] peace, everything is in there. There's
[24:17] power, there's everything in there. And
[24:20] in another place, Brother Bandham says,
[24:22] I think it's the next slide. Um, you
[24:24] know, he's the inexhaustible fountain of
[24:26] life. Um, you have it there. Yeah. So
[24:30] now that when we receive the baptism of
[24:31] the Holy Spirit to sick people now to
[24:33] you were born again of the spirit of God
[24:35] when God planted you in Jesus which is
[24:37] the inexhaustible fountain of life
[24:39] everything that you have need of was put
[24:40] in you when you receive the Holy Ghost
[24:42] for that life's journey for your healing
[24:44] your salvation your joy your happiness
[24:46] all you have to do is push out and drink
[24:48] push drink push drink hallelujah amen um
[24:53] we'll we'll go and I think we're done
[24:55] with the slides now just kind of coming
[24:58] down here just a a few more minutes. You
[25:00] know, it's little by little the prophet
[25:02] says that you you won't have those
[25:04] victories overnight. And he never even
[25:06] promised that to the Israelites either.
[25:08] He never said, "You're going to go and
[25:09] you're going to come up against every
[25:11] enemy all at once and I'm just going to
[25:12] slay them all supernaturally." Well,
[25:14] where would their where what faith would
[25:16] need to be had then? You know, he does
[25:18] it one one day at a time so that we can
[25:20] increase our faith a little bit here.
[25:22] Little by little, little by little. I
[25:25] love, you know, he um you know, just I'm
[25:29] just going to go through some scriptures
[25:30] here. Proverbs 8:17, I I love them that
[25:33] love me and those that seek me early
[25:35] shall find me. I love the amplified
[25:38] says, "I love those who love me and all
[25:39] those who seek me early and diligently
[25:42] will find me." This next one is David's
[25:45] charge to his son Solomon when he was
[25:46] given direction in his life. Um and it
[25:50] came from someone with experience in 1st
[25:52] Chronicles 28:8. He says, "Now
[25:53] therefore, in the sight of all Israel in
[25:55] the congregation of the Lord, and the
[25:56] audience of our God, keep and seek for
[25:59] all the commandments of the Lord your
[26:00] God, that ye may possess this good land
[26:02] and leave it for an inheritance of the
[26:04] children after after you forever. And
[26:07] thou, Solomon, my son, know that the God
[26:09] of thy father, and serve him, listen to
[26:11] this, serve him with a perfect heart.
[26:15] Serve him with a perfect heart and a
[26:17] willing mind. For the Lord searchth all
[26:19] things, and understand all the
[26:20] imaginations of the thoughts, if thou
[26:22] seek him, and he will be found of thee.
[26:24] But if thou forsake him, he will cast
[26:26] thee off forever. Says, "Serve him with
[26:28] a perfect heart and with a willing
[26:30] mind." What what a command.
[26:34] Um, all right. We're going to just go
[26:36] down here.
[26:39] Jeremiah 29 12 through 14. If there then
[26:44] shall ye call upon me and ye shall go
[26:46] and pray unto me and I will hearken unto
[26:48] you and ye shall seek me and find me.
[26:53] The next verse when ye shall search for
[26:56] me with all of your heart.
[26:59] Isaiah 55. Seek ye the Lord. 55 6. Seek
[27:03] ye the Lord while he may be found. Call
[27:05] ye upon him while he is near. And let
[27:07] the wicked forsake his way and the
[27:09] unrighteous man his thoughts. and let
[27:10] him return unto the Lord. You know, just
[27:14] uh for a couple of closing closing
[27:16] thoughts, you know, I took a similar
[27:19] thought um a couple of weeks ago with
[27:21] some of the young people and my title
[27:23] for that was rising to the challenge.
[27:26] So, I pray that this morning, this
[27:27] little Sunday school, this simple
[27:28] thought can give us a challenge in our
[27:31] daily walk to um live higher than those
[27:34] Israelites did there in the book of
[27:36] Judges. live a more victorious life.
[27:38] Starting with the little things, slaying
[27:40] those little lions and slaying those
[27:42] little those little things in your life.
[27:44] Little by little, seeking the ways of
[27:46] the Lord. Little by little, searching
[27:47] out our hearts and see if there will be
[27:49] any wicked way in there. And little by
[27:52] little, driving out the all the
[27:53] inhabitants of all the enemies in your
[27:56] land, in your mind. Little by little,
[27:58] giving those temptations to God. You
[28:01] know, it's not always some great
[28:03] mountain the Lord is trying to get us
[28:04] across. Sometimes it's just a small dep
[28:07] step in another day of of overcoming.
[28:10] Amen. So, let's just stand to our feet.
[28:12] We're going to just close in a little
[28:14] word of prayer.
[28:17] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful
[28:18] and grateful for your word this morning.
[28:20] We pray that Lord, we could just have it
[28:22] seat into our hearts, Lord God, and
[28:23] meditate it meditate on it throughout
[28:25] the day. Father, we love you. Lord, I
[28:27] pray that Lord, your precious anointing
[28:30] would be on our brother this this
[28:31] morning, Father. Lord, just speak to
[28:33] him, Lord. Use him, Lord. Help him just
[28:34] step out of the way, Father, so that we
[28:36] can just glean from him, Father. Lord,
[28:39] we love you now and we submit our hearts
[28:40] to you now in the name of Jesus Christ.
[28:42] Amen. God bless y'all.
