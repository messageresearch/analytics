[0:00] things the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:02] amen I want to turn if you would um
[0:07] to the Book of Ruth chapter 1 and verse
[0:13] one I'm I'm going to continue my series
[0:16] and hopefully by the grace of God part
[0:19] five will be the last one um and
[0:22] hopefully I can wrap it up today and put
[0:23] a bow on it otherwise maybe there'll be
[0:26] a part six um but I want to start in uh
[0:30] Ruth chapter 1 and verse
[0:34] one and um we'll uh I wanted to I guess
[0:41] the series has had a lot of um I guess
[0:44] uh what's the what's the word maybe the
[0:46] what nots to do and I want to I want to
[0:50] maybe this time maybe rather than
[0:52] focusing on where people go astray maybe
[0:54] focus on what it looks like when things
[0:56] go
[0:57] right and uh focus on on what we should
[1:00] be aiming
[1:02] for
[1:04] um so here is Ruth chapter 1 and verse
[1:07] one it says now it came to pass in the
[1:09] days when the judges ruled that there
[1:11] was a famine in the land and a certain
[1:12] man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn
[1:14] in the country of Moab he and his wife
[1:17] and his two sons and the name of the man
[1:19] was IMC and the name of his wife Naomi
[1:22] and the name of his two sons Malon and
[1:26] kilon ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah and
[1:29] they came came into the country of Moab
[1:31] and continued there and ALC Naomi's
[1:33] husband died and she was left and her
[1:37] two sons and they took them wives of the
[1:39] women of
[1:40] Moab the name of the one was orpa and
[1:42] the name of the other Ruth and they
[1:44] dwelt there about 10 years and maalan
[1:47] and kilon died also both of them and the
[1:51] woman was left of her two sons and her
[1:55] husband yall can be
[1:57] seated um now I want to maybe just you
[2:00] know kind of go over the the um story of
[2:04] Ruth briefly um if the booth could do me
[2:07] a favor and cut that display off because
[2:10] it is flickering and it's going to
[2:11] really distract me um and it's I'm not
[2:15] going to be able to focus because I'm
[2:16] going to be looking at that uh so
[2:21] um the anyway so so the story of of Ruth
[2:25] I'm sure everybody's very familiar with
[2:27] it um but you know so we
[2:30] you know we know that uh Ruth and orpa
[2:32] and and Naomi start heading back to
[2:34] Israel um Ruth or Naomi rather um kind
[2:37] of convinces them uh you know tries to
[2:39] convince them to both turn around and go
[2:41] home go back to to uh uh Moab and um
[2:45] orpa turns back roof doesn't they they
[2:48] ultimately go back to um uh Naomi's late
[2:54] husband his in his portion of the
[2:56] promised land you know every Jewish man
[2:58] had an inheritance a portion of of
[3:00] Israel that was allotted to him
[3:02] according to his family and according to
[3:03] his tribe and so when he had left that
[3:06] land was still belonging to him they
[3:08] just weren't it was sort of um maybe
[3:11] maybe abandoned or something like that
[3:12] you might say so Naomi and Ruth go back
[3:14] to basically take up that Old Homestead
[3:16] back in in Israel and that's where
[3:20] they're living but the problem is they
[3:21] get back around barley Harvest there's
[3:23] no food in the ground there's you know
[3:25] the the the field has been abandoned for
[3:27] however many years at least 10 years um
[3:29] there's no they're they're probably
[3:31] starving at this point and they need to
[3:33] get by um and you know it's just the two
[3:35] of them and they they can't work the
[3:37] field themselves and even if they could
[3:39] there it's wrong season to even plant
[3:40] anything it's going be a whole year
[3:41] before Anything Grows so they they Ruth
[3:45] goes out and decides that she's going to
[3:46] start gleaning in the fields right and
[3:49] she goes and you know this is a this was
[3:51] a a precept in Israel that uh you know
[3:53] during Harvest Time you don't harvest
[3:55] the corners of the fields and if if the
[3:58] Reapers drop anything on the ground
[3:59] they're not supposed to pick it up you
[4:01] leave that for the destitute and the and
[4:02] the and the the uh the people who don't
[4:05] have anything the Beggars essentially to
[4:07] come behind him and they could pick up
[4:08] the little the the leftovers right out
[4:10] of the field you know and so they would
[4:12] that's what gleaning
[4:13] is and so Ruth goes out there to just to
[4:16] find something to eat and so she's going
[4:17] out there and and and um she comes upon
[4:20] this field owned by a guy by the name of
[4:23] Boaz and she's out there gleaning um and
[4:26] then we get
[4:28] to um chapter 2 and verse
[4:31] 4 and behold Boaz came from Bethlehem
[4:34] and said unto the Reapers the Lord be
[4:36] with you and they answered him the Lord
[4:37] bless thee then said Boaz unto his
[4:40] servants said unto his servant that was
[4:43] set over the Reapers whose who damsel is
[4:46] this and the servant that was set over
[4:48] the Reapers answered and said it is the
[4:50] moabi is damsel that came back from
[4:52] Naomi out of the country of Moab and she
[4:55] and she said I pray you let me glean and
[4:57] gather after the Reapers among the Sheep
[4:59] so she came and hath continued even from
[5:01] the morning until now that she carried a
[5:04] little in the
[5:06] house
[5:08] um and uh I'm
[5:10] gonna so Boaz calls are over they have
[5:14] this conversation um he you know tells
[5:16] her you know hey uh you know I've
[5:19] recognized your character he he
[5:21] acknowledges the fact that she had left
[5:23] her Homeland to come to he that she had
[5:25] rejected her previous life to come be
[5:27] part of God's family um he recognizes
[5:30] this strong character and he um you know
[5:34] he he recog he you can see within
[5:36] himself that that's something that he
[5:37] wants to be associated with and he tells
[5:39] he pours out kindness upon her and tells
[5:41] her don't go anywhere else right he said
[5:44] keep your eyes on this field my the
[5:46] Reapers under my charge will take care
[5:48] of you don't go anywhere else right this
[5:51] is this is a portion set aside for you
[5:54] because this is mine and I have control
[5:55] over it and he invites her to basically
[6:00] have lunch with them at you know at
[6:01] lunchtime and he feeds her and takes
[6:03] care of her and then unbeknownst to her
[6:06] he pulls the Reapers in and he says Hey
[6:08] listen when you're out in the field and
[6:10] you see her coming in behind you dump a
[6:13] little on the ground on purpose right
[6:16] you know more than what you know just
[6:19] leave some for her right like we're
[6:21] going to we're going to take care of
[6:22] this girl because she had found favor in
[6:24] his sight he had recognized her
[6:27] character and um there was something
[6:30] about her that he had recognized not
[6:32] just as something Noble but something
[6:35] that was the same as he was right and
[6:39] because you know the Book of Ruth is
[6:41] titled The Book of Ruth and it's
[6:42] obviously about Ruth but it's also about
[6:43] Boaz right and the side of the story
[6:46] that a lot of people don't notice don't
[6:47] recognize because it's not really
[6:48] explicitly written although it is there
[6:51] is the fact that Boaz could recognize
[6:56] the plight that she was in because here
[6:57] she was a gentile the locals aren't
[7:00] going to take kindly to her right they
[7:02] might you know have some sort of you
[7:04] know well we're supposed to be nice to
[7:05] people so we're not going to be n well
[7:07] but you know we're not going to be go
[7:08] out of our way to help this woman right
[7:10] she's going to be absolutely be
[7:11] discriminated there's going to be some
[7:12] sort of of you know tension there she's
[7:15] going to be an outcast because she's a
[7:17] gentile right she's this Gentile woman
[7:20] who came in and people are going to
[7:22] treat her well because of that now why
[7:26] would Boaz taking a liking to that
[7:28] particularly because his mother's name
[7:30] was Rahab right his mama was Rahab who
[7:34] is a a gentile prostitute who had been
[7:37] incorporate like been prited into the
[7:39] family and been absolved of all of her
[7:41] past life but that didn't wipe away the
[7:42] fact of the way people probably treated
[7:44] her right no it didn't just go away
[7:47] people's perceptions of of who Rahab was
[7:50] and the perceptions of who Boaz was
[7:54] right no doubt there was some people who
[7:56] raised some eyebrows about boaz's
[7:57] Origins right about redeemer's Origins
[8:01] right there was no doubt some some some
[8:04] questions there so he could recognize
[8:05] the same kind of character that made his
[8:07] mother be the kind of person that she
[8:08] was was the same kind of character that
[8:10] made Ruth be who she was right there was
[8:12] he could see now this is why it is so
[8:15] important that a mother be a good mother
[8:17] right
[8:19] if young men are going to are going to
[8:22] use their mother as the example of who
[8:25] they're going to marry and if you have a
[8:27] poor example of motherhood then you're
[8:28] going to get young men marrying poor
[8:30] examples of motherhood okay a mother's
[8:32] job is probably the single most
[8:34] important job that any human being will
[8:35] ever do on the planet okay they are the
[8:37] determining factor in the in the in the
[8:41] uh trajectory of all mankind right every
[8:44] human being has a mother all of them and
[8:47] if and a good mother will will create
[8:48] good children and poor examples of
[8:51] motherhood will create poor examples of
[8:52] people okay and it is only by the grace
[8:55] of God that that anybody has a a hope of
[8:58] being truly good but a good good mother
[8:59] will certainly uh be a benefit yes amen
[9:05] um now so you know moving on with the
[9:08] story um so Ruth goes down to the down
[9:12] to the threshing floor or sorry you know
[9:15] time goes on they're they're going going
[9:17] along Naomi eventually tells Ruth you
[9:19] know that you need to go and basically
[9:21] um because she there's there's a
[9:23] connection there they we're going to go
[9:25] and and uh how do we say um there was a
[9:29] law in Israel that basically said that
[9:31] when you had a a a a woman who had been
[9:33] married and her husband died and there
[9:36] was no Sons to carry on the family
[9:38] lineage that there would be a near
[9:40] Kinsman who would take her as a wife and
[9:42] that continue the lineage of the dead
[9:43] husband okay now this goes all the way
[9:45] back to um Judah and Tamar if you're
[9:48] familiar with that and it's actually
[9:49] referenced specifically in here and
[9:51] hopefully we'll get to reading it um and
[9:54] so she's going to go to Boaz as the
[9:56] Kinsman to restore
[9:59] Naomi's dead husband's family tree right
[10:02] right that's what so Naomi's Redemption
[10:07] is in here and Ruth's Redemption is in
[10:09] is all tied up in
[10:11] this
[10:15] um and so she goes and so Naomi they
[10:18] they come together with this plan how
[10:19] Ruth is going to go about this and then
[10:21] this is going to be in um chapter 3 and:
[10:25] 6 and she went down the under the floor
[10:27] and did according to all that her
[10:28] mother-in-law had B her her and when
[10:30] Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart
[10:32] was merry he went um to lie down at the
[10:34] end of the Heap of corn and she came
[10:36] softly in un covered his feet and laid
[10:37] her down and then skipping down to verse
[10:40] 14 um and she laid his feet until the
[10:42] morning and she Rose um up before one
[10:46] could know another and he said let it
[10:49] not be known that a woman came into the
[10:50] floor and also he said bring the veil
[10:53] that is upon thee and hold it and when
[10:55] she held it he measured six measures of
[10:57] barley and laid it on her and she went
[10:58] into the SE City and when she came into
[11:00] her mother-in-law she said who art thou
[11:02] my daughter and she told her all that
[11:04] the man had done to her and she said
[11:06] these six measures of barley gave he me
[11:09] for he said to me go not empty unto thy
[11:12] mother-in-law then said she sit still my
[11:15] daughter until thou know how the matter
[11:16] will fall for the man will not rest
[11:18] until he have finished the thing this
[11:20] day
[11:22] um and I'm going to skip some of this
[11:25] reading
[11:26] um uh
[11:30] so this is in chapter 4 um and in
[11:34] verse 11 we'll say and all the people
[11:37] that were in the gate and the elders
[11:38] said this is after Boaz uh goes and
[11:41] meets the near Kinsman right because
[11:42] there's a near Kinsman that technically
[11:44] had rights and when he went to that near
[11:46] Kinsman and said hey are you going to
[11:47] buy this this land off of Naomi right
[11:50] because the land had to remain in the
[11:52] family that was part of the law and she
[11:54] say oh sure I'll I'll buy the land go ah
[11:56] but if you do you got to marry this
[11:58] moabit right right and the the near
[12:01] Kinsman says I no no I'm not going to
[12:02] pollute my Bloodline with that Gentile
[12:05] right I'm not going to do that so he it
[12:08] says you know I will not Mar my
[12:10] inheritance so he doesn't so he he
[12:12] basically rejects Ruth and in doing so
[12:14] Boaz now has rights to buy the land and
[12:17] marry Ruth and so then um you know and
[12:20] as a token brother brand if you ever
[12:22] hear way brother BR tells a story he
[12:23] basically he says that boas took his
[12:25] shoe off and threw it at him as the
[12:27] because that's the that's the uh the
[12:29] ancient sign that you they would give
[12:30] the other person their shoe so he he
[12:32] slaps the guy in the face with the shoe
[12:34] and um says all right I'm gonna go marry
[12:36] this girl and um the
[12:42] uh doesn't say that but you know brother
[12:45] brandom said it
[12:47] happened
[12:49] um
[12:51] uh okay so this is verse 11 of chapter 4
[12:54] and all the people that were in the gate
[12:55] and all the elders said we Are Witnesses
[12:57] the Lord make the woman that is come
[12:59] into thine house like Rachel and Leah
[13:01] which to did build the house of Israel
[13:04] and do thou worthy of Ephrata and be
[13:07] famous in Bethlehem and let thy house be
[13:10] like the house of FZ whom Tamar bear
[13:13] unto Judah of the seed which the Lord
[13:16] shall give thee of this young woman okay
[13:18] so they're recognizing that this is a
[13:20] this is the whole purpose of this entire
[13:21] thing is the restoration of the seed
[13:23] line
[13:25] okay and then it says uh verse 13 so
[13:28] Boaz took Ruth and she uh she was his
[13:31] wife and when he went in unto her the
[13:33] lord gave her conception and she bare a
[13:34] son and the woman said unto Naomi
[13:36] blessed be the Lord um which hath not
[13:40] left thee this day without a Kinsman
[13:42] that his name may be famous in Israel
[13:45] and he shall be unto thee a restorer of
[13:47] thy life and a nourisher of thine old
[13:49] age for thy daughter-in-law which loveth
[13:51] thee which is better to thee than seven
[13:54] sons hath borne him all
[13:56] right so this is great story a lot of
[14:00] people you know and so you see this as
[14:01] sort of like this this Romance of here's
[14:03] this this young woman who's kind of an
[14:05] outcast she comes to Israel she's got a
[14:07] lot of baggage previous marriage that
[14:09] Man's dead she's got all who knows what
[14:10] kind of emotional Trauma from that um
[14:14] and this guy decides to fall you know he
[14:16] falls in love with her and he marries
[14:18] her and it's a beautiful romantic story
[14:19] and it's a great example of how men
[14:21] should treat their wives and how women
[14:22] should treat their husbands and how a
[14:24] marriage is supposed to function and it
[14:27] is that it is it is all of that because
[14:30] it is also a type of Christ and the
[14:32] bride okay not only Christ and the bride
[14:36] both Jew and Gentile because you have
[14:39] Naomi and you have Ruth amen and so look
[14:42] at this story you have a gentile woman
[14:45] goes to leaves the promised land because
[14:49] it is no longer hospitable she goes away
[14:52] goes to another place into a gentile
[14:53] Kingdom where which if you know the name
[14:55] of her husband it means um I'm drawing
[14:58] it's I don't remember exact verbage but
[14:59] it's I believe it is um the Lord is my
[15:02] king I think is is what his name meant
[15:05] ALC um or something very similar to that
[15:07] it was a reference to God being the king
[15:09] over Israel and he died because the
[15:12] Kingdom of Israel failed when they left
[15:14] the promised land they go on a diaspora
[15:16] they go to a a gentile land when so
[15:22] watch this to place the story of Ruth
[15:26] and Boaz and how it is a type of Christ
[15:28] in the bride
[15:30] it is when Naomi the Jews go back to
[15:32] their Homeland in that
[15:36] moment now we have an uh the the um the
[15:41] romance between Christ and the bride
[15:42] that is where we have an invisible Union
[15:45] happened once the Jews are back in the
[15:47] Homeland here you have Ruth who comes
[15:49] into the Homeland or goes you know is
[15:51] now in a place where she can meet the
[15:53] kinsman redeemer the
[15:56] Redeemer watch what happens when she's
[15:58] gleaning in the field here you have the
[16:01] Boaz is a type of Christ comes to the
[16:03] field the field is the world right we
[16:06] know this is if you're study the student
[16:08] of the scripture you know the the field
[16:09] is is a representation of the world he's
[16:12] going to the Reapers the Reapers
[16:14] represent
[16:15] Ministry okay so here's the bride being
[16:19] fed by the Reapers being fed by the
[16:20] ministers as they as they drop you know
[16:23] food on the ground for her and he goes
[16:25] and who does he talk to the servant over
[16:28] the Reapers there is one man who is set
[16:30] over the Reapers he is part of the
[16:32] Reapers but he is not on you know he's a
[16:34] little higher because he is the
[16:36] intermediary between the Redeemer and
[16:38] the Reapers okay and his job is to one
[16:43] instruct the reapers on how they are
[16:45] supposed to handle the boaz's Affairs
[16:48] number one and number two he is there so
[16:51] that when Boaz shows up and says who is
[16:53] this woman the head over the Reapers
[16:54] presents the Gentile bride to the
[16:57] Redeemer okay we see the parallels here
[17:00] okay we have we have a a gentile bride
[17:03] in this day okay who is what is she's
[17:07] being fed there's there's ministers but
[17:10] there is one Prophet right there is a
[17:12] there is a a messenger who is the
[17:14] intermediary between right he's the one
[17:17] who's who's representing who's who's
[17:19] who's Christ is speaking through
[17:22] right who instructs the ministers on how
[17:25] to properly handle the bride and he's
[17:29] the one who presents the bride to the
[17:31] Redeemer
[17:33] okay
[17:35] so and so there's this and so they build
[17:38] this relationship this is a type of how
[17:39] Christians deal with our our our our
[17:42] relationship with God and how you know
[17:45] you know there there's ministers and
[17:47] Ministry and all these things but at the
[17:49] end of the day what it all comes down to
[17:53] is there's this
[17:55] moment excuse me
[17:57] when when it's time to actually have a
[18:01] real relationship they have a friendship
[18:03] they have an association they spend time
[18:05] with each other but when it comes time
[18:08] to really build a something that's going
[18:10] to be permanent right when it comes time
[18:14] for for Ruth to really lay claim to Boaz
[18:18] as the kinsman redeemer it takes
[18:22] Solitude it takes a moment in which she
[18:25] goes to Boaz
[18:27] alone okay that the relationship between
[18:30] Ruth and Boaz ultimately came down to
[18:32] them having a private conversation right
[18:35] that when she went to him it for Boaz to
[18:38] really be a redeemer in Ruth's life they
[18:41] had to have something special that
[18:42] didn't involve a lot of Reapers it
[18:44] didn't involve a lot of people right and
[18:46] it when people come to Christ and get a
[18:49] real experience with God it is a
[18:51] solitary experience it doesn't matter
[18:54] where you are you can be on in out in
[18:55] the woods crying out to God or you can
[18:57] be at an altar with 100 preachers around
[18:59] you it doesn't matter at the end of the
[19:01] day you go to God alone okay you leave
[19:04] behind everything else because you know
[19:07] nobody else is going with you it is a
[19:09] solitary experience amen and but when
[19:13] you do that you and you present your
[19:15] Veil to the Redeemer he watch this is
[19:19] such a beautiful type he puts six
[19:22] measures of barley in her in her veil
[19:24] which is a type of her submission right
[19:26] he reveals six seals to to her because
[19:30] there's a SE because he he he pulled it
[19:32] out of the seventh which was this giant
[19:35] it was the whole mountain of barley that
[19:36] they just harvested out of the field
[19:38] right there was a seventh measure but it
[19:41] was him yeah right the the the Redeemer
[19:44] was the
[19:46] seventh uh portion right and so when by
[19:51] building this relationship with the
[19:52] Redeemer the the whole thing is
[19:55] this
[19:57] uh it's this type of of of of the of the
[20:01] bride and Christ and it all culminates
[20:05] in one in in this um uh I would say the
[20:09] Pinnacle the culmination of this entire
[20:11] thing is the Sun that is born it's the
[20:16] key to the entire thing every single
[20:19] time that you have that you speak of
[20:22] redemption it
[20:25] all uh anytime you have um
[20:29] uh in the Bible throughout the Bible
[20:30] whenever you're talking about
[20:33] Redemption almost always is it
[20:35] associated with the birth of a child
[20:37] amen with the birth of a son right you
[20:40] look at look at Eve and Adam when Adam
[20:43] redeems Eve how does he do that right he
[20:46] does it by you know associate putting
[20:49] his life into her which produces Abel
[20:51] right Eve was redeemed through the birth
[20:54] of Abel okay obviously you have Ruth and
[20:58] and her son and and the Redemption of
[21:00] Ruth and Naomi were both facilitated
[21:02] through the through the birth of Ruth's
[21:04] Son by Ruth reproducing and replicating
[21:09] the Redeemer right that she took his
[21:11] life and then made that
[21:14] manifest we see the same thing with Mary
[21:17] what does Mary do she sees the word for
[21:19] her day and says be it unto me and
[21:22] produces a redeemer
[21:25] okay John when in in uh Revelations chap
[21:29] 10 what happens the mighty Angel comes
[21:32] down and he's given the book feed on the
[21:34] word and then prophesy again okay
[21:37] Redemption happens by feeding on the
[21:39] word and then prophesying if you go back
[21:42] to Enoch what happens with
[21:46] Enoch Enoch looks up at the stars
[21:48] brother Bram said that God wrote his his
[21:51] first Bible in the
[21:54] Stars okay wrote his first Bible in the
[21:57] Stars that's why Paul could say that the
[21:58] people in the anian world um uh rejected
[22:01] go the word of God because they rejected
[22:03] the god of nature right because God is
[22:06] wrote a Bible in the stars and it you
[22:09] know the so Enoch looks at the stars
[22:12] takes in the word and what does he do he
[22:13] builds a pyramid and brother brandom
[22:15] said that God the second Bible that was
[22:17] written was Enoch's pyramid yeah okay
[22:19] and if you study the pyramids you know
[22:21] exactly how much I mean nobody actually
[22:24] knows it's it's every time the more
[22:26] people look into this like you know
[22:27] people study this the more it's just
[22:29] mindblowing how many things are
[22:31] associated with that pyramid where it is
[22:32] like a perfect reflection of the Stars
[22:35] where the the astrologic the the the
[22:37] alignments and the the way it's it's
[22:39] it's shaped the the curvature there are
[22:41] curvatures in it that that perfectly
[22:42] match the curvature of the earth it's
[22:45] incredible but what was it
[22:47] Enoch took the word of his day which was
[22:50] written in the
[22:52] heavens and then believed it and then
[22:55] manifested it through a spoken word into
[22:57] a into a into again he replicated the
[23:00] word of God and then God raptured him
[23:03] right that is the purpose of this day so
[23:07] that we as the bride of Christ can take
[23:09] on the Life of Christ right that we have
[23:11] been given the word we've been we we
[23:13] have a relationship with the Redeemer
[23:17] you build a relationship with the
[23:18] Redeemer you feed on the word you you
[23:20] you you you all you have to do right all
[23:24] Ruth had to do was have a relationship
[23:25] with Boaz it wasn't like something that
[23:28] she had to like you know have this
[23:30] conscious decision about right it wasn't
[23:33] like um all she had to do was build that
[23:37] relationship draw close to the Redeemer
[23:39] to fall in love with the Redeemer that's
[23:41] all she had to do and when she did
[23:44] that then she just expressed his life
[23:47] right it all happened automatically and
[23:49] naturally as a as just a a byproduct of
[23:52] the relationship that she had built and
[23:54] that's exactly what we have to do in
[23:55] this day that we draw close unto God
[23:59] right we draw close to the word we feed
[24:01] on the word we draw close to it because
[24:03] it's the thing when you do that it will
[24:06] change your nature it will change who
[24:09] you are you know when a when you know
[24:12] when a uh a a woman is taking on the
[24:15] life of a man and is and is going to
[24:17] express that in the form of a baby her
[24:19] attitude changes radically right who she
[24:23] is is very different than who she was
[24:25] just a couple of weeks ago and it
[24:27] happens really fast
[24:29] okay you can have a a a skinny 100 PB
[24:34] girl who can't eat a four piece chicken
[24:37] nugget without leaving
[24:39] leftovers and then a week later she will
[24:43] demolish a half a
[24:45] meatloaf and it's
[24:47] like where did that come from and it's
[24:51] because there was there's a a new nature
[24:54] growing inside of her that's changing
[24:55] who she is she has desires she has she
[24:58] has
[24:58] has uh hunger that she didn't have
[25:01] before she has need to feed on things
[25:03] that she didn't have the need of to feed
[25:04] on before because the her Nature has
[25:06] changed because of the life that she's
[25:09] expressing and is and it doesn't require
[25:12] a whole bunch of you know chemistry lab
[25:15] to make that happen doesn't require a a
[25:18] a mathematics degree to figure that out
[25:20] all that has to happen is that there was
[25:22] a
[25:23] relationship that there was a closeness
[25:25] there was a a romance between the the
[25:28] Redeemer and the redeemed and it just
[25:31] happens automatically
[25:34] right and um that is the end because I'm
[25:38] out of
[25:40] time but that's that if you know I'll
[25:43] I'll I'll I'll we can stand and I'll and
[25:45] I'll pray but just in one one final
[25:50] statement that is the key that is going
[25:52] to bring people in a in a Rapture that
[25:55] when we feed on the word that's all it
[25:57] takes you feed on the word word you you
[25:59] draw close to God you read your Bible
[26:01] and pray every day because in doing that
[26:05] okay in doing that in drawing close to
[26:06] God your nature will change the your
[26:09] faith will grow and the thing that will
[26:10] bring you in a Rapture the the
[26:12] manifestation of that life will happen
[26:14] by itself automatically you don't redeem
[26:17] yourself Ruth did not redeem herself
[26:20] Boaz did the redeeming all Ruth had to
[26:22] do was build a relationship with the
[26:25] Redeemer let's pray father father Lord
[26:28] we thank you for this time that you've
[26:30] given us we thank you for the the word
[26:32] that you've given us we ask that you
[26:33] would be with us throughout the service

[26:41] would come
[26:42] forward and bring your word that we
[26:44] could feed on it and be edified by it
