[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so do [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] good morning everyone god bless you let's stand and pray gracious father we come to you now lord and we ask that your presence would be with us throughout the day today lord that you would anoint us with your holy spirit lord give us ears to hear lord help us all to get ourselves out of the way lord that your spirit would flow through us that you would be glorified that people would be healed touched delivered in every way they have need of father we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen all right i'm going to start on a book of acts church part two and we're looking at mark 13 verse 10 to start with what is our commission what was their commission in the book of acts and the god and the gospel must first be published among all nations all right then matthew 24 verse 14 and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come amen may the lord add the blessing to the reading of the word can be seated we talk about there's going to be another book of acts if if that original branch ever puts forth another branch which will produce fruit it will write another book of acts behind it and i think and maybe maybe it's just me but often i think oh uh the miracle isn't supernatural that's what's being referenced but that's not that's only a part of it right that's not the whole picture that's that's that's only a small portion of it the purpose of the miracles is not just to say hey we're we're a pentecostal church the pentecostal denomination has miracles the charismatic denomination has miracles it's not just that it's the nature behind that it's the purpose behind that brother branham says the pentecostal church cannot accomplish the great commission in the condition that it is today right the pentecostal denomination so in other words there's a great commission to be accomplished and there has to be a church that's in condition to accomplish it and so we have to be in that same condition and have that same heart it's not merely miracles and supernatural and healing services that's not what the book of acts is about the book of acts is about jesus christ being proclaimed among the nations and because he's being proclaimed among the nations because he's supernatural the supernatural follows but what if the church settles in and gets confused and says another book of acts is just miracles are they another book of acts there's another pentecost and so that's the danger is you're you're looking at the gifts instead of the what the giver has asked us to do and focusing on what the giver would have us to do now we all have a different calling we all have a different purpose so just like when we preach to a specific sin might not be talking about you but this might be talking to someone right there might be someone who the lord is working a commission in their lives maybe they're resisting maybe they're not hearing and they need to go forth nevertheless in the small scale and in the big scale of missions all of us need to have the heart what was that what what did brother branham say one of what if we took one of the one of the evidences of the holy ghost what did he say it was the people sighing and crying for the abominations done in the city and what did he put that onto a burden for lost souls there should be a burden in each of us for lost souls not just to have good youth programs and good youth camps and it's it that's good that's just the mc that's that's the mechanics what behind it needs to be a heart to see people saved and delivered and set free if we get our focus on the mechanics what is it it's just it's another program and brother branham continually condemned looking at it like that we have a program we had this many come in we have this so what what if you just are sent one to one place and it's just for one person are you disappointed or you say thank you lord that i accomplished the purpose you sent me for it might just be for one soul you you might labor and work and sacrifice everything and there's just one person that you've won to christ but your heart through all of that was to see souls transformed when jesus christ is proclaimed in truth the supernatural follows but don't get it out of order don't be so focused and say well we have to have the supernatural that you become pentecostal denomination nothing we want we we know that miracles follow goodness i that testimony the service we had on wednesday night i i thought why is everyone just staring forward we should be hanging from the from the ceiling the miracles that god did and my goodness some of the miracles that were done is just it's like astounding why what is that why why are there miracles why is there supernatural because we're following the word signs follow the word but don't get your focus on the signs that you missed the word the purpose for it all is proclaiming jesus christ all right scriptural signs of the times in 1964 brother branham says we all claim to be in christ but when we come in there with the denominational creed we live by it that's right but if that tree ever brings forth another branch it'll be another book of acts wrote behind it it'll be like the first branch was that that come forth it'll be holy ghost filled holy ghost inspired holy ghost there'll be no creed to it it'll be a word so book of acts church they gave up everything to follow christ they built their lives around the word and prayer they anticipated and expected to be applauded lauded as heroes no in fact they were told specifically by jesus you'll be hated you'll be persecuted you'll be spoken against in other words made fun of and to top it all off the cherry on the top is you'll be killed okay when they were told to stop preaching about jesus did they run and hide at a corner they said well should we obey god or should we obey men they continued preaching about jesus they labored and were sent to reach every nation now don't get this wrong but they didn't spend their all so that they could go to a special meeting and be made to feel good no or get patted on the back again i'm not speaking against special meetings i'm not speaking against camps but what do we spend our all on what do we give our all on they didn't do that in the book of acts they spent their all for what nations and people that hated and despised them that didn't want them there that fought against them why because there was a predestinated seed amongst those nations that needed to hear the gospel and they were willing to give their all for that they turned the world upside down right they died as martyrs almost 100 of them amen hallelujah another book of acts another book of acts it's only miracles right we only want miracles we're in america we're soft we're sissified just give me miracles that's what the book of acts is you're you've never read the book of acts apparently greater than solomon is here in 1963 brother branham says the church needs tonight not a soft hybrid something soft and flabby like the church is a confession be baptized and you're christian to be a christian is self-denial denial deny yourself take up your cross and follow me daily today it's so soft and people call themselves christians when it used to mean death to confess christ and you had to depend on him daily for everything you had need of god is identified by his characteristics in 1964. today we got hotbed plants called christians somebody you have to spray and baby and humor oh and will you give me fellowship will you cooperate will you do this oh you bunch of hot bed plants we need some genuine christianity born of the spirit of god and that will take no cooperation no nothing else they don't want nothing listen to that they don't want nothing what do they want christ they don't need a promise they don't need someone to pat him on the back they don't need someone say oh oh we'll give you a position we know you've we're sad you have you're upset we have to give you this and pat you on the back no no that's sissified christianity we toughen up we're not called to be hybrid plants we're called to be able to grow in the hot sun with the heat of difficulties and trials beating down on us and that should actually make us thrive should strengthen us not weaken us and desire for oh someone come pat me on the back we don't need a human being to approve us we are looking for one person to say well done we i love you all i know you love me i hope maybe not after this but it doesn't no regardless regardless i want to please christ i want to live for christ and whether anybody recognizes or disrespects or throws tomatoes at me i want to serve christ i want to be faithful to him not worrying about oh my feelings are hurt which part of the book of acts was that in my feelings are hurt and yet feelings get hurt and now what now what are we hotbed somebody come and spray that one you got to spray them no let's be rugged let's be strong let's be tough brother branham says in another quote let's take the word just as it is preach it lay it out and he says real christians love it they're not offended by the word being preached in its fullness they love it because why it makes me right with him that's what i want that's what i may oh aim my whole purpose is john 12 24 and 25 verily verily i say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it brings forth much fruit he that loves his life shall lose it and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal brother branham quotes this verse and he says and the people in the sermon why in 1962 and the people don't want to die you want to be alive in the world and still you want to be religious so you accept an intel intellectual conception of it and then when you do that you're still dead in sin and trespasses don't listen to that and say that's in denominations the message the messages coming to us and these things are coming to us people will take an intellectual conception in this message and they they don't want to be confronted they don't want to die to themselves they want to be they want to have a form of truth a form of truth and yet be a little bit like the world but not like christ or the conception or maybe it would be more this way our conception of christ is this but the reality is christ is here knocking at the door of your heart speaking forth his word it's not about our conceptions of who christ is how accepting he is how open he is yes he is and yet when he was accepting an open of those who were broken sinful destroyed what did he tell them go and sin some more go and sin no more it was it was about meeting that soul and bringing them to repentance not just meeting that soul and bringing them in and loading up the church there needs to be repentance what happened to the church are we waiting for the lost and dying to come to us are we hoping that people are that are opposing the message they'll just stop opposing the message or are we willing to take our stand are willing to stand up for truth and preach the truth no matter what opposition comes i want to speak about some men of god a few men of god through history that uh had did an incredible did incredible things for the gospel william booth of the salvation army we know the salvation army today and that's the place where we drop off our clothes right that's not what the original salvation army was and where it was if you if you get a little bit background of this it's just incredible the heart that william booth had and i want that same kind of heart one memorable day in july 1865 after exploring the streets in an east end district so how many are familiar with 1800s london east end you've never been there so i'll tell you neither have i i guess uh not that old kids josh you're thinking that um 1865 east end of london was this absolute slum it was filthy dirty full of drunks society was broken children running around without parents living on the streets just absolutely beyond beyond awful beyond terrible so one memorable day in july 1865 after exploring the streets in an east end district where he was to conduct a mission the terrible poverty vice and degradation of these needy people struck home to his heart he arrived at his hammersmith home just before midnight and greeting his waiting catherine with these words darling i have found my destiny can you imagine he went to the place that no one wants to go and he comes home yes yes i found my destiny now that is christ in a man she understood him together they administered god's grace to god's poor in many places now they were to spend their lives bringing deliverance to satan's captive captives in the evil jungle of london slums one of his he had a one of his sons was named bramwell so one day william booth took bramwell his son into an east end pub okay just imagine imagine that for a second picture in 1800s east end slum how how bad it smells the the filthy talking that's going on the drunkenness the sin that's taking place in this pub so he takes his son into an east end pub which was crammed full of dirty intoxicated creatures seeing the appalled look on his son's face he said gently bramwell these are our people the people i want you to live for isn't that amazing what a beautiful thing these are the people i want you to live and suffer and bring out of captivity to satan that's the heart of christ how many have ever heard of ct stud that's a pretty awesome name though isn't it he's a pretty awesome guy ct stud was like at the time maybe would say like kevin durant or or aaron rodgers he was a superstar in cricket very important sport in england at the time everyone loved and lauded ct stud his father was an extremely wealthy man multi-multi-multi-multi-millionaire in today's money and when the lord called him he inherited all that money and he already had a calling to be a missionary wouldn't you think oh my goodness how wonderful now all my missions work will be taken care of from now on do you know what ct stud did with all those multi-millions of dollars he gave every single dime to dl moody every single dime to him and he went to the missions field penniless trusting god and so he he had a ministry and he in in china in india in africa and he was working to raise up other missionaries and stand with them and help them get get started as missionaries in these far-off places and so he wrote a little pamphlet called christ's etc in other words christ's nobodies christ's the castaways of the world people that no one cares about no one's concerned about and he was saying this is what i am christ's etc i'm not important i'm not nobody i'm not trying to be anybody i just want to see souls saved and heathens have a chance to hear the gospel so he he writes in his little pamphlet can it be the years of christ's soldiers are deaf to the call of god and the cries of the dying souls of men king nicholas declared to his wartime rivals that his montenegrins would henceforth spill their blood for their persecuted compatriots when shall god be able to say have you seen my christians of today no longer they seek for gold or pleasure for honors or ease from henceforth my christians will spill their blood for the love and cause of my beloved son and the salvation of the neediest of men yes when when indeed shall we see a real church militant here upon the earth he says we should go crusading for christ we have the men the means and the ways the doors of the world have been opened wide for us by our god so believing that further delay would be sinful some of god's insignificants and nobodies in particular but trusting in our omnipotent god have decided on certain simple lines according to the book of god to make a definite attempt to render the evangelization of the world and accomplish fact for this purpose we have banded together under the name of christ etc and invite others of god's people to join us in this glorious enterprise we are merely christ's nobodies otherwise christ etc as we rejoice in and thank god for the good work being carried on in the already occupied lands by god's regular forces we seek to attack and win to christ only those parts of the devil's empire which are beyond the extremist outposts of the regular army of god oh i love that our method is to search and to find out what parts of the world at present remain unevangelized and then by faith in christ by prayer to god by obedience to the holy spirit by courage determination and supreme sacrifice to accomplish their evangelization with the us most dispatch paul writes romans 15 20 and 21 yea so have i strived to preach the gospel not where christ was named lest i should build upon another man's foundation but as it is written to whom he was not spoken of they shall see and they that have not heard shall understand and you shall be mark 13 13 you should be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved paul says for me to live is christ and what to die is gain second corinthians 5 8 he says we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord that's a different world focus isn't it i'm ready to go out of this body i don't count it as a sacrifice i counted it to something that's a gain he also says in first corinthians 6 20 for you are bought with the price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods romans 14 8 for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lords it seems in a way isn't that a little bit of cavalier statement towards life and death seems like it but the reality is he wasn't living for this space of time he was living to glorify christ no matter what the cost might be knowing that there was a greater reward for him if he dies in service to the king do we have this heart are we ready to live and die in service to christ that was the heart of the book of acts church that was what behind the preaching of the gospel and the supernatural that took place it was this kind of heart is it ours be not afraid brother branham says god goes to the gutters let's stand god goes to the gutters goes out into go out into the streets and highways and compel them to come in and remember that was the last call the church has gone off without him see you've gone off on tantrums let's not go off on tantrums let's not go off without christ let's be a part of the last call which is go into the highways and byways and compel them to come in go into the gutters let's pray heavenly father we asked lord that there would be a a true book of acts heart in us that would produce another book of acts behind it lord if any of us me included have gone off on tantrums gone off in the direction that we should not have gone and focusing on things that we shouldn't focus on lord please please help us please deliver us please correct us please give us this heart help us to be rugged christians not needing to be patted and babied but looking for the approval of you lord not of man lord you're our leader you're the one who guides us you're the one who directs us and we want to be led by you in everything father and when we know that each of us as individuals are led by your spirit it produces what a beautiful harmony and unity but when we step out and are not led by your spirit that creates such a disunity among us lord and it's like pulling pulling in the wrong direction but lord may your holy spirit just come upon us give us that book of acts vision and nature lord that burden for lost souls that passion lord we ask these things in jesus name amen god bless you
