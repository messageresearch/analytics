[3:31] That's your desire today. Brother Jason

[3:35] there was three words he said.
[3:38] Conditions. That's four conditions of
[3:41] your heart. Four words.

[3:50] Amen.
[3:52] Just want to be so true.
[3:56] I can't wait
[3:58] although I have to to get rid of this
[4:00] old mortal thing. Amen. As our brother
[4:03] spoke about
[4:05] sin and repentance, it's a constant
[4:08] thing. And brother Brandham said,
[4:10] "You're going to have that sticky old
[4:12] nature till you get out of here. But you
[4:15] got to keep it under control." And
[4:17] that's what he gives you the Holy Spirit
[4:19] for. Amen. I have a prayer request this
[4:22] morning from Sister Andrea.
[4:24] It says, "Please remember Sister Ruby
[4:27] Vallejo
[4:29] having surgery Monday at 9:30 to have
[4:32] stints put in her carterid arteries.
[4:37] Her heart and the physical needs help."
[4:40] Amen. Let's pray.
[4:42] Father, we love you this morning.
[4:46] We just humble ourselves before you,
[4:48] Father, knowing you are the great King,
[4:50] the Lord of Lords, and the King of
[4:52] Kings. Father,
[4:54] I love you, Father, and I praise you
[4:55] this morning. How I can look at my own
[4:58] life so many times, Father, and Lord,
[5:01] how I just I want to do better. I want
[5:04] to come up higher, longing for the day
[5:07] with a change of this body, Lord.
[5:10] I pray for your people this morning. We
[5:12] remember Ruby Vallejo, sister, father,
[5:15] this morning.
[5:17] Lord, this old body picks up all kinds
[5:19] of things as our brother Brando spoke
[5:21] about.
[5:23] And Father, you've also blessed the
[5:25] medical field with many marvelous things
[5:27] that they can do to help us
[5:30] as she goes into surgery tomorrow. May
[5:32] she be comforted with the fact that we
[5:35] many saints are lifting her up before
[5:37] you, Father, praying that in the name of
[5:39] Jesus Christ,
[5:41] Lord, that she would come out of this
[5:43] surgery well and good. Father, you watch
[5:46] over the doctor's hands.
[5:50] What if it was me, Father? Or what if it
[5:52] was one of these? Our own pastor,
[5:55] Father, has gone through a procedure,
[5:57] Father, of the heart. And Lord, we're so
[6:00] thankful that you brought them through.
[6:03] We pray for our sick and our afflicted
[6:05] this morning. We lift them up before
[6:08] you, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ
[6:10] that you'd watch over them. Help them,
[6:13] Father, each and every one.
[6:16] And Lord, we just pray for the breaking
[6:17] of the bread this morning.
[6:20] That wonderful gift you've ordained in
[6:23] this day and time, Father, the preaching
[6:25] of the gospel. May it have full
[6:27] preeminence
[6:28] today in this place and those that would
[6:30] stream.
[6:32] And Father, as we collect the tithes and
[6:34] offerings, I pray that you bless the
[6:36] cheerful giver. Father, we're so
[6:38] thankful that you blessed us. You keep
[6:40] us, Father.
[6:42] There are many people today going
[6:43] without a food, without roof over their
[6:46] head.
[6:47] Father, we just pray and thank you so
[6:49] much for your blessings in Jesus' name.
[6:52] Amen.

[38:14] Amen. He's all I need, friends. Is he
[38:17] all you need? I love telling him that. I
[38:20] love telling saying, "Lord, you are
[38:22] truly all that I need." Amen. We greet
[38:26] you in the name of the Lord. Today we
[38:28] have um one particular prayer request
[38:30] that came to me uh from Sister Phyllis.
[38:33] She said, "Good morning. Please remember
[38:36] Susie and her husband Dmitri in prayer
[38:38] at church this morning." She has preops
[38:41] around 9:00 a.m. on Monday. Uh and her
[38:45] surgery is at 1:00. So that's tomorrow.
[38:48] I'm trusting in the Lord's plan. That's
[38:50] a good place to be, isn't it?
[38:52] I'm trusting in the Lord's plan. We
[38:54] appreciate your prayers so much. Thank
[38:56] you. Missing being there with y'all
[38:59] already. Amen. Well, we certainly miss
[39:02] Sister Phyllis's smiling face here among
[39:04] us. She's going to be up there for a
[39:05] number of weeks. Amen. The families, um,
[39:08] ask her to be there. So, uh, we're here.
[39:12] We're going to carry on in the Lord.
[39:13] Amen. Amen. Turn around and shake hands
[39:15] with somebody. I can see you need to do
[39:17] that. Amen. No, you start over. Stop.
[39:21] Shake that hand. Say, "God bless you."
[39:22] Big old smile. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[39:29] Amen.
[39:31] Micah, good to see you, bud. Praise the
[39:32] Lord. Happy to have you here with us
[39:34] today.
[39:36] Amen. We're going to invite you into the
[39:38] scripture this morning to the book of
[39:41] Daniel.
[39:43] Amen. Brother Daniel, we're going to
[39:45] preach from your name's sake today.
[39:46] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[39:50] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[39:54] Chapter 12.
[39:56] Daniel chapter 12.
[40:06] Amen.
[40:09] Oh, well, I'm not going to get there in
[40:10] the book of Malachi, will I?
[40:14] Um, I want to by the help of the Lord
[40:18] continue
[40:20] today in my in my study on uh our future
[40:24] events that are that are facing us,
[40:27] events that are happening right now and
[40:30] future events. And I'm I just kind of
[40:32] will maybe give a little bit of a
[40:34] qualifier. I'm not today trying to
[40:38] qualify every prophecy that we see.
[40:43] That's a kind of a teaching service.
[40:45] That's um I'm trying to do a little
[40:47] something a little different today.
[40:49] We're going to just mention a few places
[40:52] that that I have put down in my notes to
[40:55] make, you know, just to kind of get us
[40:58] all understanding that first of all,
[41:01] we're at the end of the end times.
[41:03] That's first. And that we're all in this
[41:06] thing together. Amen. And so, you know,
[41:10] I I I would imagine that the people are
[41:14] who are super spiritual have a hard time
[41:17] waiting on people like me who are not.
[41:19] So, and can you please catch up so we
[41:21] can all go into the rapture?
[41:24] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Ask your
[41:28] neighbors, he talking about me?
[41:31] Amen. Talking about us all, friends.
[41:33] We're all in this thing together, aren't
[41:35] we?
[41:35] Amen. So, I want to really focus my
[41:39] attention today on something I've been
[41:41] trying to get to for weeks, and that is,
[41:44] you know, we've talked about how that
[41:46] really you are the most notable modern
[41:50] event made clear in prophecy. And I hope
[41:53] that sticks. I hope you really absorb
[41:56] that that the bride of Christ is the
[42:00] most notable. Just like brother Brandon
[42:02] would referring back to the ministry of
[42:05] the son of man that could discern the
[42:08] secrets of the heart. And he was saying
[42:12] there in the 1960s this is the the last
[42:15] sign you'll see. Now he wasn't the point
[42:19] is not the last thing they'll see is
[42:22] someone who can discern the secrets of
[42:24] hearts. We know that that's Christ and
[42:26] he he was doing that back in Genesis. So
[42:30] that's not the part that's, you know,
[42:32] that brother Brandham is trying to
[42:33] emphasize. I don't think that's where
[42:35] the Holy Spirit is just saying to us.
[42:37] Well, 70 years ago, the earth saw its
[42:40] last sign. You have to realize, friends,
[42:43] that the ministry of the son of man
[42:47] means the word made flesh.
[42:50] And and so a prophet was on the scene
[42:53] showing showing the sign of what it
[42:58] would look like when the word lives in
[43:00] flesh right near the end time.
[43:02] Amen.
[43:03] Amen. But you realize that the bride of
[43:06] Christ was just in her infancy
[43:09] at that time.
[43:11] She was certainly not. And we've had to
[43:13] come through that growth. And we can
[43:16] look back and we can say, "Well, this
[43:17] camp and that camp and this preacher and
[43:20] that kingdom builder and this schism and
[43:21] that problem." But I'm just want to tell
[43:24] you something. There's really never been
[43:25] a problem in God's word or his family.
[43:28] He's in always been in control.
[43:30] Everything has clicked right along. I
[43:33] get that there's the fringe. I get that
[43:35] there's fanaticism. I get it. But I'm
[43:37] not here as a news reporter to point you
[43:40] to all the negative things. I want to
[43:42] have a message of thus sayeth the Lord
[43:44] that is positive that you are being
[43:47] changed.
[43:48] The world is coming to a transition. It
[43:51] is not ending. That's the first thing.
[43:53] The world is not ending. It's
[43:55] transitioning. The millennium is coming.
[44:00] Nothing can stop it.
[44:02] It's coming. And everything that is
[44:05] before that is being not going to be it
[44:09] is being swept aside.
[44:11] Amen. And mankind every 24 hours is 24
[44:15] hours closer to his self-destruction.
[44:18] And I say that with underscore. It is
[44:21] not God going to destroy the world. It
[44:23] is God simply going to remove the
[44:26] hindrance to man destroying himself.
[44:28] And that is the bride leaving the earth.
[44:30] And when she leaves, then the the the
[44:33] bleeding word is gone from the earth.
[44:35] There's no more ring of mercy. God sees
[44:37] the earth in its horrible state. And
[44:39] then and then judgment pours out all of
[44:41] those vials and everything that came up
[44:44] under seals, trumpets, and vials.
[44:47] Everything that happened in partiality
[44:50] in those vials are going to be poured
[44:52] out in fullness. what they broke
[44:54] partially in the ages. Uh they're going
[44:57] to be just like brother Brandham said, a
[45:00] seal partially opened, a mystery
[45:02] dropped, a messenger caught it, ran with
[45:04] it. Right.
[45:06] Right. Come on.
[45:07] Don't let me have to start over with
[45:08] fundamentals. And and the messenger ran
[45:11] with it. It gathered a bride. The
[45:13] messenger fell asleep. That bride fell
[45:15] asleep. People came in behind it,
[45:17] denominated it, which was a rejection of
[45:19] the of the original message. And then a
[45:23] plague was dropped.
[45:25] See, judgment, a temporary, brother I'm
[45:27] called it a temporary judgment. So
[45:29] you've got those vials partially just
[45:31] like the seals partially cracking open.
[45:33] The vial partially cracks open and we
[45:36] realize that in the last day when
[45:37] brother Brandham is standing there and
[45:40] he throws that rock up into the air and
[45:42] he says, "You've got to do something."
[45:43] And so he remember brother Ma uh Matthew
[45:46] preaching on how you disturb the
[45:48] atmosphere around you. And so he said,
[45:50] "You've got to do something." Just like
[45:52] Elisha threw meal into the poisonous
[45:54] food. Right? So, so you he threw a rock
[45:58] up in the air. He said it went up and it
[46:00] come down and it creates a little
[46:01] vortex, a little disturbance in the
[46:03] atmosphere. And he said, "Thus sayeth
[46:06] the Lord, judgment striking the West
[46:08] Coast." He said it lifted from there and
[46:09] headed west. Came down in Alaska as a as
[46:12] a pre-warning. And he said, "Wait till
[46:15] it comes down head and shoulders there
[46:17] on the West Coast." And we know uh all
[46:19] the prophecies that are coming when that
[46:23] when that prophecy is fulfilled and they
[46:26] denied what he said and said it wasn't
[46:28] true and accused him of this and that
[46:30] and he just simply said you'll find out
[46:32] one of these days when well Los Angeles
[46:35] is laying beneath this ocean and so they
[46:37] will find out. I that my personal belief
[46:39] is that's the possibly right at the the
[46:42] time of the bride and the resurrection
[46:44] and I don't want to preach all that this
[46:46] morning. even preached it before. We've
[46:47] placed that in the Gospel of Matthew 27
[46:49] and Matthew 28. There's two earthquakes
[46:52] there. So, we've had the one at Alaska.
[46:54] We've got one on resurrection morning.
[46:57] And I think that if if if that pattern
[47:00] holds, then that would be the earthquake
[47:02] that would bring the sleeping saints,
[47:04] which explains why brother Brandham
[47:05] thought we would see the California
[47:07] quake.
[47:08] I'm just not sure I'll see it in this
[47:10] body. Amen. I
[47:11] think I might have a new one by that
[47:13] time or or a simultaneous event. I'll
[47:16] take it.
[47:18] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, so, uh, you
[47:21] know, we're looking at it like that. So,
[47:24] I said all that to say this that that
[47:27] the bride has grown into her maturity
[47:31] and therefore now the it's still true
[47:35] only now even more so. um more so not by
[47:40] something additional but by the maturing
[47:42] of something. Brother Brandon was saying
[47:44] this is the last sign you'll see. I'm
[47:46] here to tell you the very last thing
[47:49] that the earth is seeing right now is a
[47:52] mature bride being ready for the
[47:54] rapture. She's the image of the word
[47:57] made flesh. She's moving throughout. She
[47:59] has the she has thus sayeth the Lord or
[48:01] she keeps still. Have you ever thought
[48:03] that that's not about you trying to
[48:06] imitate brother Brandham and get in a
[48:08] pull pit and say thus sayeth the Lord.
[48:10] It's that it's a voice of your life is
[48:13] thus sayeth the Lord.
[48:14] The way our marriages are conducted is
[48:16] thus sayeth the Lord. The way our church
[48:18] is run, that's thus sayeth the Lord.
[48:21] You're the final thus sayeth the Lord.
[48:24] Praise God.
[48:24] The earth will ever see.
[48:25] Amen. That's right. And when that
[48:28] capstone and that earthly bride unite
[48:30] completely and that's the last thing
[48:33] that's we're we're moving toward that
[48:35] we're hurling towards it. And when that
[48:38] happens, brother Brandham said, then the
[48:40] dead for hundreds of years will come up
[48:42] out of the grave and we which are alive
[48:44] will be changed and off we go.
[48:48] Oh my. May it be so, Lord Jesus. Even
[48:53] so, come quickly.
[48:55] Amen. And so this is this is where I
[48:59] want to try to get you to comprehend
[49:01] because as I and I know you're still
[49:03] standing uh because I I but I'm
[49:06] attaching back to when we were last
[49:08] speaking, you know, showing these kinds
[49:11] of things. So So let's read our our
[49:14] verses in Daniel chap 12.
[49:19] Amen. So it's a lot to do with with
[49:23] theophony today. our word body.
[49:27] And so we we we talked to you last time.
[49:30] That's why when it when it talks about
[49:32] you've heard from your theophony, it's
[49:33] it's all part of a recognition. I want
[49:35] to deal with that today because that's
[49:38] really the strength of overcoming.
[49:41] That's why Jesus had such power because
[49:45] having been theophony before he was
[49:47] flesh, which you bypassed, but having
[49:49] been theophony before he was flesh, that
[49:52] that revelation of who he was, that he
[49:55] had come from God, went back to God,
[49:57] that he and his father were one, that is
[50:00] will conquering
[50:03] because he had a human will that had to
[50:04] be conquered.
[50:05] Amen.
[50:06] The Bible says he learned obedience by
[50:09] the things he suffered. Is that
[50:10] scripture?
[50:11] The Bible says God hath made that same
[50:14] Jesus both Lord and Christ.
[50:16] Amen.
[50:17] Is that scripture?
[50:18] The Bible says the child submitted
[50:20] himself to Joseph and Mary. Is that
[50:23] scripture? So he was fully God. He was
[50:26] fully a man. Now you if you try to
[50:29] understand that in your own finite
[50:31] terms, it's not going to make sense. You
[50:32] have to remember Jesus was a brand new
[50:35] type of human
[50:37] like none had that ever been.
[50:39] Amen. He was a prototype of what every
[50:43] son and daughter are coming to.
[50:46] Amen.
[50:46] Right.
[50:47] All right. So that's why when you die
[50:50] here, you go to that theophony body
[50:52] already in the heavens.
[50:53] And if you're alive and remain, that
[50:55] theophony comes and joins with you and
[50:57] then that becomes a glorified body.
[51:00] Wow. Friends, isn't that beautiful?
[51:02] Then then that should give your life
[51:04] purpose and meaning. You should
[51:05] understand I'm here. My goodness, I'm
[51:07] here for a reason. Yeah,
[51:09] I'm to accomplish something. All right,
[51:11] may we please read Holy Spirit? All
[51:14] right,
[51:15] verse one.
[51:17] I'm sure you can tell my mind is just uh
[51:20] already there.
[51:22] And at that time, Michael shall Michael
[51:24] stand up the great prince which standeth
[51:27] for the children of thy people. And
[51:30] there shall be a time of trouble such as
[51:32] never was since there was a nation, even
[51:35] to that same time. And at that time thy
[51:39] people shall be delivered, everyone that
[51:42] shall be found written in the book. And
[51:45] many of them that sleep in the dust of
[51:47] the earth shall awake, some to
[51:49] everlasting life, some to shame and
[51:53] everlasting contempt. And they that be
[51:57] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[52:00] the firmament. and they that turn many
[52:03] to righteousness as the stars forever
[52:06] and ever. But thou, oh Daniel, shut up
[52:09] the words, and seal the book, even to
[52:13] the to the time of the end. Many shall
[52:16] run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
[52:22] increased.
[52:24] Let's pray. Father, we commit ourselves
[52:27] into your hands today and we ask for
[52:29] your divine will to go forward. Lord, I
[52:32] humble myself again in your presence.
[52:35] Unworthy and unfit, Lord, as we are, but
[52:38] in you, Lord, you have made us worthy.
[52:40] And Father, so we go forward in faith,
[52:43] just like you went forward in faith,
[52:46] aware of who we are, aware of why we're
[52:48] here. I understand it, Lord, better than
[52:50] I ever have before in my life. It gives
[52:53] me purpose. It gives me a renewed
[52:55] feeling to press the battle like never
[52:57] before. There's a great accomplishment
[53:00] to be accomplished laying just ahead of
[53:03] us. It's just a little ways ahead of us.
[53:05] So Lord, help us now to press to that
[53:08] mark. We commit ourselves into your
[53:10] hands today completely. I'll need you to
[53:12] be in complete control in Jesus name.
[53:15] Amen. God bless you friends as you're
[53:17] seated.
[53:43] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[53:47] Just saw a prayer request, but I'll
[53:48] certainly take that up. Amen.
[53:52] Personally,
[53:57] now I just want your undivided
[53:58] attention. We're going to um I'm going
[54:01] to watch the clock very carefully and uh
[54:04] I'm going to allow myself the 55 minutes
[54:07] to get back around to the top of the
[54:09] hour. Um wherever we are at that point,
[54:12] uh if I'm within a few sentences of the
[54:15] end, I'll carry on. And if it looks too
[54:17] far, we'll pull the parachute and jump
[54:19] out and we'll pick it back up. Amen.
[54:21] We've got Brother Diggs coming the the
[54:24] uh the 9th, Wednesday the 9th for us.
[54:27] So, just to make that little
[54:28] announcement,
[54:29] we had a wonderful time Friday night,
[54:32] Brother Matthew and I and uh Brother
[54:33] Brad and Sister Sarah. We were there in
[54:35] Colombia to hear Brother Ron Peterson.
[54:37] My goodness, what a wonderful atmosphere
[54:39] and a wonderful sermon that was.
[54:42] Brother Brham says in the exposition of
[54:45] the seven church ages in the thigh and
[54:48] church age
[54:50] and you know you were you're going to
[54:51] remember that I've instructed you to see
[54:55] the correlation between that fourth age
[54:58] and the se the seventh age. They're they
[55:01] share a lot of similarities and and
[55:04] because and I could turn to read it but
[55:06] we we're not we're going to save time.
[55:08] We've taught on it before, but that's
[55:10] the time when the Antichrist, you know,
[55:13] took full control. You've got a crowned
[55:15] false prophet. You've got him sitting in
[55:17] Satan's seat. You've got Jezebel
[55:19] religion. You've got forced religion.
[55:21] You've got the commencement of dark
[55:23] ages. Amen.
[55:25] So, we find that that comes back again
[55:28] at the end of the seventh age. Jezebel
[55:30] religion is now in control. Darkness has
[55:34] has covered the whole earth and gross
[55:36] darkness the minds of the people. The
[55:38] Antichrist system and his image are in
[55:40] full control of events. Don't be fooled.
[55:43] They're in full control now. What
[55:45] they're choosing to exercise uh uh is
[55:49] not what they could be doing. But just
[55:52] remember this that their choices are
[55:54] limited so long as you are here.
[55:58] They they might not acknowledge that.
[56:00] They wouldn't want to think that.
[56:02] Brother Brandham said Jezebel did not
[56:04] believe that Elijah was her pastor, but
[56:06] he was nonetheless. She didn't listen to
[56:09] him. That didn't stop God. Amen. And she
[56:12] still suffered the fate that that the
[56:14] prophet said she would. So it doesn't
[56:17] matter. They can jump up and down and
[56:19] roll on the ground, throw dirt in the
[56:20] air, and march and hold up signs and
[56:22] wave flags. It's not going to stop the
[56:24] word.
[56:25] The world is transitioning. The
[56:27] millennium is coming. And whatever is
[56:30] not millennial is passing away from this
[56:33] world
[56:34] once and for all.
[56:37] So, brother Brandham says here, here's
[56:39] another cor correlating point from the
[56:42] fourth age. He brother Brandham says in
[56:44] in the cab, the thotiry age, I will put
[56:48] upon you, he's reading the scripture, I
[56:50] will put upon you none other burden.
[56:52] See, so there they they were they were
[56:55] in a time where it was so notable to God
[56:59] that this is the time of Satan in full
[57:02] control, dark ages, Jezebel, triple
[57:05] crown pro false prophet. I mean it the
[57:08] church was almost extinguished. And so
[57:11] because of that, God said to them, you
[57:14] know, I I know you've got this and that
[57:16] and I've got a concern about this and
[57:17] that, but however, uh, if you'll just do
[57:20] this, I'll put no other burden upon you.
[57:23] And I love correlating to today because
[57:26] the condition for me to be born again is
[57:31] not to checkbox a list of rules or to
[57:34] accomplish a bullet list. It's not about
[57:37] how successful I am with keeping the
[57:39] message. He said, he says, and here's
[57:42] the requirement that you believe the
[57:45] word for your hour. Now, that's more
[57:47] than a mental ascent. And that's the
[57:49] that's the tricky part because it's not
[57:52] just agreeing with the teaching. The
[57:54] devil agrees with the teaching, but it's
[57:57] that your life from the from the bed of
[58:00] your life, the bedding ground of your
[58:02] life, you're willing to say, "Amen." in
[58:05] my life to whatever the word has called
[58:08] for. Whatever I've got to leave,
[58:11] separate from, depart from, change,
[58:13] flip, do over, start back, go again.
[58:16] Whatever direction, I'm here to say amen
[58:20] to what I know. Amen to what I don't yet
[58:23] know. Whatever is my future, amen. I'm
[58:26] already saying amen. And I'm not going
[58:28] to change it.
[58:30] That's right.
[58:31] I'm a believer. Full stop. Praise God.
[58:34] I will never not be.
[58:35] Amen.
[58:36] See, I I would rather die than not be a
[58:39] believer because to me to live is Christ
[58:42] and to die is gain.
[58:44] So, so I'd be better off if I went on
[58:47] like Paul said. But if I'm going to have
[58:49] to be here, I'm sure going to be a
[58:51] believer.
[58:54] You can bet your bottom dollar on that
[58:56] one. I'm going to be a believer.
[58:58] I may not operate perfectly. I may
[59:01] stumble and fall, but don't you ever
[59:03] think I'm not a full thoroughbred
[59:06] believer of every word that God has sent
[59:09] in this hour. And it is my daily
[59:11] striving to to emulate that and manifest
[59:15] all of the word in my life
[59:18] so that my conversation, my my life
[59:21] activities are the final voice to the
[59:23] final age.
[59:24] Amen. Amen.
[59:25] So, Brother Brandham is saying here they
[59:28] So, and and he's saying to to us, I will
[59:31] put no further burden on you.
[59:33] So, you don't I I I won't require you to
[59:36] be some super duper duper beyond your
[59:39] ability. I'll just require you to be
[59:41] what I've called you to be.
[59:43] And And you say, "Well, Lord, but I I I
[59:45] know it, but I don't I'm having a hard
[59:47] time getting there." Just believe it and
[59:50] keep pressing the battle. Just keep
[59:52] pressing. Just keep reaching for a
[59:55] higher handhold on the mountain and pull
[59:57] yourself up a little higher.
[1:00:00] Amen. We're we're marching. We're
[1:00:03] climbing to Zion.
[1:00:07] Oh, put no other burden upon you. The
[1:00:10] word for burden is weight or pressure.
[1:00:12] He says the pressure of the dark ages
[1:00:15] was either bend or be broken, bow or
[1:00:19] die. It was the Inquisition,
[1:00:23] the power of the empire
[1:00:28] backing up satanic worship. It's where
[1:00:30] we're at today.
[1:00:32] Be organized or pay with your life. Now,
[1:00:34] the when that comes to pass, that'll be
[1:00:38] Lot's children.
[1:00:40] Amen.
[1:00:40] That'll be for the foolish virgin. And
[1:00:42] when they won't join, they will choose
[1:00:44] death.
[1:00:46] But that's not for Abraham's children.
[1:00:48] Amen.
[1:00:50] So he says here,
[1:00:52] so he says, "Be organized or pay with
[1:00:54] your life." Each age had its pressures.
[1:00:57] For example, a great burden of the last
[1:01:01] age.
[1:01:02] Hello.
[1:01:03] Amen.
[1:01:04] Are you Is that you?
[1:01:06] A great burden, not the only one, but
[1:01:08] it's a great one. This a biggie. All
[1:01:10] right. A great burden of the last age is
[1:01:15] the pressure of riches.
[1:01:17] Yeah.
[1:01:18] soft living
[1:01:20] and nervous tension
[1:01:23] in a complex age that come on, let's own
[1:01:28] it. We seem unfitted to live in.
[1:01:32] Amen.
[1:01:34] Amen.
[1:01:34] And we we can all say amen to that.
[1:01:38] We know that soft living and riches,
[1:01:40] many have, as James said, many have
[1:01:43] pierced themselves through
[1:01:45] with riches, chasing after it. Nothing
[1:01:47] wrong in and of itself, but it's what
[1:01:50] are you chasing? What are your
[1:01:51] priorities? What are you doing to
[1:01:52] accomplish
[1:01:54] those things? See, so if you're willing
[1:01:56] to go outside of the path of God's will
[1:02:00] for your life, then there's where you're
[1:02:01] going to have a problem.
[1:02:03] As long God may have a path for your
[1:02:05] life that acquires wealth. And that's
[1:02:08] fine. If that's God's path for your
[1:02:09] life, he knows who can handle it, who
[1:02:11] can't. Most can't. Some can. And so God
[1:02:14] knows who to bless in that way. in
[1:02:16] others, he'll bless them in other ways.
[1:02:18] And the rich man will go, "Man, if I
[1:02:19] just had your kind of an attitude and
[1:02:21] spirit, I I struggle with this and
[1:02:22] struggle with that." And here you are
[1:02:24] thinking they're a superch Christian,
[1:02:25] and you realize they think you're a
[1:02:26] superch Christian.
[1:02:28] Oh, I'm just glad that we're all
[1:02:29] believers.
[1:02:31] Amen.
[1:02:32] And that's how that's my barometer on
[1:02:34] on, you know, where you are in your
[1:02:38] life. That's how I gauge as a shepherd
[1:02:41] because I'm I'm I'm committed to taking
[1:02:45] uh the the master said to me when I was
[1:02:48] very young, here's a here's a group of
[1:02:51] lambs. I want you to take them and go
[1:02:54] along the mountain and the hillside and
[1:02:56] the valleys and care for them and watch
[1:02:59] over them and feed them, nurture them,
[1:03:02] protect them, and bring them back to me
[1:03:05] mature and bearing wool. And that's what
[1:03:08] I'm doing to this day, 30 years later.
[1:03:10] Hallelujah. So, the thing that concerns
[1:03:14] me is when I see
[1:03:17] my flock trying to go after weeds, and
[1:03:21] brother Brandon said, "A real shepherd
[1:03:23] will almost jerk them away from it if he
[1:03:25] has to." I'm sorry if it comes on strong
[1:03:28] sometimes, but I have a commission.
[1:03:31] I I I I I answer to somebody. See,
[1:03:35] and so we realize that soft living, the
[1:03:37] pressure of riches, nervous tensions in
[1:03:40] a complex age. Brother Adam would call
[1:03:42] it a neurotic age.
[1:03:46] We seem unfitted to live in. That is so
[1:03:48] true. We so long for our heavenly home.
[1:03:52] Amen. Our our millennial life back here
[1:03:55] on earth. It's coming.
[1:03:58] Reel in the Holy Spirit. It's coming.
[1:04:02] Amen. See,
[1:04:05] brother Brandham comes to this message
[1:04:07] that I've been so rolling around in. Who
[1:04:09] is this Melzdc?
[1:04:11] Being eternal in him at the beginning.
[1:04:15] Now, we've talked about some of this
[1:04:17] before, but I felt obligated that I
[1:04:21] needed. And I've got probably at least
[1:04:23] maybe five or a half a dozen small
[1:04:26] excerpts of Brother Brandham saying what
[1:04:29] I'm trying to preach to you today as a
[1:04:31] theme so that you'll know this isn't
[1:04:33] something brother Jason pulled out of
[1:04:34] thin air. I want it established in your
[1:04:37] hearts by the messenger.
[1:04:39] Amen.
[1:04:40] So, Brother Brandham says, and I'm just
[1:04:41] going to read it verbatim.
[1:04:44] being eternal with him at the beginning.
[1:04:47] The eternal life that you had and I on
[1:04:50] purpose didn't put it on the slide. I
[1:04:51] want you just to focus listening. The
[1:04:54] eternal life that you had, his thought
[1:04:57] of what you was only he wanted to he
[1:05:01] wanted me to stand in the pull pit. Say
[1:05:04] he wanted you to sit in the seat. Then
[1:05:07] we are serving his eternal purpose.
[1:05:09] Amen. So you don't have to be over in
[1:05:12] Russia or China preaching. You're
[1:05:13] serving his eternal purpose right now.
[1:05:16] There's there, you know, I mean that
[1:05:19] that it's such a privilege to come to
[1:05:22] the house of God and serve his eternal
[1:05:24] purpose.
[1:05:26] So when you so when you find people who
[1:05:28] are not doing that and they're supposed
[1:05:30] to be believers, then you automatically
[1:05:32] know they have a different purpose.
[1:05:36] They're operating their purpose, not
[1:05:38] God's purpose. I that might sound
[1:05:41] offensive, but that's the truth.
[1:05:43] Amen.
[1:05:44] If Christ is not the center of your
[1:05:47] life, then you're guiding part of your
[1:05:49] life, and you're not supposed to do
[1:05:51] that.
[1:05:52] Amen.
[1:05:56] And he so he says he wanted you to sit
[1:05:58] in the seat. Then we are serving his
[1:06:00] eternal purpose. And now here it is.
[1:06:02] This is heavy, man. This is heavy. And
[1:06:06] the one that left home
[1:06:09] only come to the earth to serve his
[1:06:11] purpose. So I left a home somewhere. And
[1:06:14] I came here to build a career in a bank
[1:06:17] account.
[1:06:21] I left home and I came here to be a
[1:06:24] leader of of a country. I came here to
[1:06:27] be the smartest person in in some
[1:06:29] university. I came here to serve his
[1:06:32] purpose. The one that left home. I left
[1:06:35] home.
[1:06:36] I didn't start here.
[1:06:39] I only came here,
[1:06:41] but I started somewhere else and I'm
[1:06:42] going back there. So, while I'm here,
[1:06:44] I'm here to serve his purpose.
[1:06:47] And whatever, however that looks.
[1:06:50] I'm as I'm saying, it's not about the
[1:06:52] pursuits you have chosen. God bless you
[1:06:54] in your education and your career and
[1:06:57] your pursuit of wealth and you want to
[1:06:58] take care of your family. I understand
[1:07:00] all of that. I do the same thing.
[1:07:03] But but is Christ remaining the center
[1:07:06] of those pursuits?
[1:07:09] And if you had the opportunity for an
[1:07:12] advancement that hindered his purpose in
[1:07:14] your life, what would be your choice?
[1:07:17] Amen.
[1:07:19] This is what was mindbending when
[1:07:21] William Brandham brought this message.
[1:07:23] Who is this MKZDC? This is what blew the
[1:07:26] theologians apart. They couldn't. Are
[1:07:28] you honestly saying that that you didn't
[1:07:31] start here? That you started somewhere
[1:07:32] else? Yes. And that you're here as part
[1:07:35] of as part of an eternal being? Yes. And
[1:07:37] you're actually you're actually part of
[1:07:39] his genes. Exactly like I was in my
[1:07:41] earthly father. I was in him. And not
[1:07:44] everybody's like that. No.
[1:07:46] Amen.
[1:07:46] Well, who said that? Jesus.
[1:07:48] Amen. That's right.
[1:07:49] Well, how did you get here? The spirit
[1:07:50] moved on me.
[1:07:51] Amen.
[1:07:52] The spirit found me. I didn't find him.
[1:07:55] He found me. Hallelujah.
[1:07:56] Hallelujah.
[1:07:57] All right. Is that right?
[1:08:01] So God gives every human being that's
[1:08:03] ever been born a nonfacitious
[1:08:06] opportunity. It's a legit opportunity to
[1:08:10] save himself from destruction. As I've
[1:08:12] pointed out to you before, you cannot
[1:08:13] impugn God. He even tried to save the
[1:08:16] son of his archeneemy, Cain.
[1:08:19] And that was the son of his arch enemy.
[1:08:21] And he even offered him a way.
[1:08:22] Amen.
[1:08:23] To save himself.
[1:08:24] Wouldn't take it. God knew that he
[1:08:26] wouldn't take it, but that doesn't mean
[1:08:27] God forced him to not take it.
[1:08:29] See, so every man gets an opportunity a
[1:08:33] and they have to make a choice. But
[1:08:35] Jesus said to his church, "You have not
[1:08:37] chosen me. I have chosen you." Plain and
[1:08:40] simple.
[1:08:40] Amen.
[1:08:41] And so the only the the choice that we
[1:08:44] make is a choice I couldn't not make.
[1:08:49] I couldn't. Do you think I could choose
[1:08:51] to not love Sister Debbie? That was
[1:08:53] impossible. Impossible.
[1:08:56] And a and a young man like me tried to
[1:08:58] run from that. It was hopeless. Then she
[1:09:00] played hard to get and made me pay for
[1:09:02] it. Man, that was a rough three months.
[1:09:05] Amen. But Amen. Once once I got back
[1:09:08] under the graces, I never wanted out
[1:09:09] again.
[1:09:11] And that was back in our dating days
[1:09:14] when I was stupid.
[1:09:17] [Laughter]
[1:09:20] Amen. Praise the Lord. All you all you
[1:09:23] wives should be elbowing your husbands.
[1:09:24] I should hear like all the men going,
[1:09:26] "Amen." Like, "Amen."
[1:09:30] All right. So then after it's finished,
[1:09:35] the one that left home only come to the
[1:09:38] earth to serve his his purpose. Is that
[1:09:41] right? All right. Then after it's
[1:09:43] finished, it's brought back in a
[1:09:46] glorified state.
[1:09:48] It's it's matured
[1:09:50] and brought back. Amen.
[1:09:53] Amen.
[1:09:53] You got me?
[1:09:55] So, so now I want you to think about
[1:09:59] some modern events because the Bible
[1:10:02] says that at the end time there's going
[1:10:04] to be a unique quality that had not been
[1:10:06] in the earth prior. Men shall run to and
[1:10:10] fro. For even for that to even be
[1:10:13] possible, you would have to be living in
[1:10:15] the modern day of modern travel. I just
[1:10:18] saw that there's a man, a British man,
[1:10:20] who's almost near uh the end of his
[1:10:22] journey. He's now crossed uh into Europe
[1:10:26] and he's got to walk across Europe and
[1:10:28] swim across the English Channel back to
[1:10:30] England. And he will have
[1:10:31] circumnavigated on foot uh the entire
[1:10:36] earth.
[1:10:37] And you say, "Wow,
[1:10:39] the dude's only just now in Europe and
[1:10:41] he's got to go all walk through Europe
[1:10:42] and swim the English Channel and get
[1:10:44] back." If you understood where he
[1:10:46] started from,
[1:10:48] my goodness, I mean, he he's he he he he
[1:10:50] literally has circumnavigated the entire
[1:10:53] earth. And he's already had to swim the
[1:10:56] Caspian Sea because he couldn't go up
[1:10:58] into Russia cuz as a British citizen,
[1:11:00] that wouldn't work too good. And he
[1:11:01] couldn't go down into Iran because that
[1:11:03] definitely wouldn't work too good. And
[1:11:05] so he can't fly. So he's got to swim. He
[1:11:08] swam 200 and some odd miles across the
[1:11:10] Caspian 200 some odd K across the
[1:11:12] Caspian Sea. And so now he's got to swim
[1:11:14] the English Channel. He's he's walking
[1:11:16] on foot. So, so, so, so you realize and
[1:11:20] it's taken him 20 years,
[1:11:23] 20 years to get where he's at now. So,
[1:11:26] you can see that what Daniel is
[1:11:28] referring to is a much faster because
[1:11:31] mankind, humanity is going to run to and
[1:11:34] fro. It's not just going to be, you
[1:11:36] know, try to get on a ship. It's and try
[1:11:38] to do this and try to that. But but now,
[1:11:40] not only are we able to traverse the
[1:11:43] world and run to and fro, we're able to
[1:11:46] go off-world.
[1:11:48] And the and what has accomplished that
[1:11:50] is the next line, knowledge shall be
[1:11:53] increased.
[1:11:54] So, you're going to hit a time where
[1:11:56] knowledge is increased and mankind is
[1:11:58] going to come into things. I just saw a
[1:12:01] statistic from uh a a think tank and and
[1:12:04] these are these men are all top men. I'm
[1:12:07] not going to give you their background,
[1:12:08] but they're they're they're top men uh
[1:12:11] in their field and they're they're you
[1:12:14] know and they put together a study. I
[1:12:16] think in fact is this this statement
[1:12:19] which was agreed to by all of the team I
[1:12:23] think if I'm remembering correctly was
[1:12:26] pinned by the founder of Google. Amen.
[1:12:29] And he and he he makes the statement
[1:12:33] that in the next 10 years by 2035 and 10
[1:12:38] years goes like that.
[1:12:39] Oh yeah.
[1:12:39] I've already been pastoring here three
[1:12:41] times longer than that. 10 years goes
[1:12:43] like that. And he said they said by 2035
[1:12:47] we will have advanced further in
[1:12:49] science, engineering and technology than
[1:12:52] we have in the previous 100 years back
[1:12:55] to 1925.
[1:12:57] He says, "Now just go back a hundred
[1:12:59] years to 1925 and you've got Model T's
[1:13:02] and things like that and you don't even
[1:13:04] I think one out of five homes maybe had
[1:13:08] a telephone in it." And you know, a few
[1:13:11] people had automobiles there. There was
[1:13:14] no there was there was no such things as
[1:13:16] super highways, supermarkets, any of
[1:13:18] that kind of stuff. It was an agrarian
[1:13:21] mostly still the even though the
[1:13:22] industrial revolution had begun. And and
[1:13:25] now think to where we've come to with
[1:13:27] the advancement of computers and the
[1:13:29] internet and social media and rocket
[1:13:31] ships.
[1:13:32] Yeah.
[1:13:33] That can leave orbit and travel. You
[1:13:35] see? So that's what we've done in a
[1:13:37] hundred years and in 10 years we will
[1:13:40] outpace that.
[1:13:42] Amen.
[1:13:43] This will outpace that.
[1:13:45] Yeah.
[1:13:46] Another uh think tank that I was been
[1:13:49] been studying only I only use verifiable
[1:13:52] sources.
[1:13:54] Um, this is not chat GPT. This is actual
[1:13:56] I listened to their um their their um
[1:14:00] their um it wasn't all just podcasts.
[1:14:02] They were actually doing seminars uh big
[1:14:05] e expositions uh and so with the
[1:14:08] smartest people in the world and they're
[1:14:10] they're talking about regenerative
[1:14:12] medicine
[1:14:15] and they're they've already been able
[1:14:18] through biology and cell manipulation.
[1:14:22] They've already been able to take mice
[1:14:25] that are blind and make them see.
[1:14:29] They've already got they they give a
[1:14:32] disease to a lab mouse and he's dying
[1:14:35] and his organs are failing and they do a
[1:14:37] little manipulation, inject him with
[1:14:39] that and within four weeks he's per more
[1:14:42] healthy than all the other mice and he
[1:14:44] has reversed his age.
[1:14:47] Amen. And they're talking now that
[1:14:49] within within within five years I think
[1:14:53] within three years they expect uh a AGI
[1:14:57] artificial general intelligence which is
[1:15:00] these AIs thinking for themselves.
[1:15:02] Yes.
[1:15:03] And then in and that's within three
[1:15:04] years and then within five years they're
[1:15:07] already saying that that that they
[1:15:09] believe in five years they will be able
[1:15:11] to cure every disease.
[1:15:15] Amen. and that within 10 years they'll
[1:15:17] be able to expand the human life to at
[1:15:19] least 200 years.
[1:15:22] You say that's never going to happen.
[1:15:24] It's already happened. They already
[1:15:26] lived hundreds of years in the book of
[1:15:28] Genesis.
[1:15:29] So it's not unprecedented that a human
[1:15:31] being could live that long.
[1:15:33] See, so I I'm just I'm just mentioning
[1:15:36] these things to kind of bring you to our
[1:15:39] scripture. Men shall run to and fro and
[1:15:42] knowledge shall be increased
[1:15:44] to the point that he but but the but the
[1:15:47] rub is he's eating from the tree of life
[1:15:50] and he's gaining a knowledge enough
[1:15:53] knowledge to completely destroy himself
[1:15:57] say well but deterrence and mutual
[1:16:01] destruction and they know a a a person
[1:16:03] who's insane doesn't care about mutual
[1:16:05] destruction
[1:16:06] that's right
[1:16:07] a person with religious fervor will go
[1:16:10] ahead and martyr himself in the entire
[1:16:11] planet if he thinks that he's going to
[1:16:13] bring the 12th imam who's a Muslim
[1:16:16] leader who's going to lead the whole
[1:16:18] world and he's going to he's going to
[1:16:19] end up in paradise. He's he won't
[1:16:21] hesitate to push that button.
[1:16:24] So the problem is that you've got all of
[1:16:26] this god knowledge
[1:16:28] in fallen humanity. You people say is it
[1:16:32] going is mankind really going to destroy
[1:16:34] himself? I my question would be how
[1:16:36] would he not destroy himself
[1:16:39] because p power that kind of power god
[1:16:41] power apart from character is satanic
[1:16:44] and that is incontrovertible in history.
[1:16:48] Amen.
[1:16:50] You see that in history.
[1:16:53] You know they're they're they're they're
[1:16:55] talking about doubling the life
[1:16:56] expectancy and and and maybe they
[1:16:58] they're even aiming for uh you know
[1:17:02] eternal life is what they're aiming for.
[1:17:03] And and this is kind of what they were
[1:17:05] saying. Although they weren't they were
[1:17:07] trying not to use that word, but that's
[1:17:09] what they were aiming for. I I'm so glad
[1:17:11] I don't got to wait on a laboratory to
[1:17:13] give me eternal life.
[1:17:16] Hallelujah. They don't even have a
[1:17:17] concept of what eternal life is.
[1:17:22] They think it just life with no end. And
[1:17:24] they don't they miss the whole part of
[1:17:26] that it had no beginning. Right?
[1:17:29] See,
[1:17:31] so if you have no beginning, so it's not
[1:17:34] about beginning or ending because if you
[1:17:36] have no beginning, you can't have an
[1:17:38] ending. The only way to have an ending
[1:17:40] is if you had a beginning.
[1:17:42] So it's something else, not ending and
[1:17:45] beginning and ending. It's different.
[1:17:47] See, they are talking about now America.
[1:17:51] Here's a modern event. America is now
[1:17:53] being looked to once again for its
[1:17:56] leadership more than it has in the last
[1:17:58] half century. And and I've been reading
[1:18:01] the statements of premers and prime
[1:18:02] ministers and kings and presidents and
[1:18:05] chics and and these guys and they're all
[1:18:07] they're all and I'm not trying to make
[1:18:09] Donald Trump into something. I'm just
[1:18:10] simply saying he's the man he's the man
[1:18:12] sitting in the chair that's supporting
[1:18:14] the image.
[1:18:17] That's what he is.
[1:18:18] I'm not I'm not casting shade on him as
[1:18:20] a man. I don't know him, but I'm simply
[1:18:22] saying there's going to be a people uh
[1:18:25] holding that chair behind that resolute
[1:18:28] desk who are the authority giving power
[1:18:30] to the image to the beast. That's a
[1:18:33] modern event made clear to us in
[1:18:36] prophecy.
[1:18:37] That's happening. That's now. That's
[1:18:39] right now. That's in full swing. And
[1:18:42] they're all talking about how that, you
[1:18:44] know, this is the the only country in
[1:18:47] the world that could have effectively
[1:18:49] clapped back to Iran and and destroyed
[1:18:53] their nuclear. And now you say, "Oh,
[1:18:55] finally they're they're they're getting
[1:18:58] okay, finally we got past that
[1:18:59] nonsense." the the the minister of uh
[1:19:03] the defense minister, I forget his name,
[1:19:06] uh in Israel has already sent an
[1:19:09] official notice to the IDF, prepare for
[1:19:12] war. The ceasefire is about to end.
[1:19:16] And they were asking one person, you you
[1:19:18] think that means the Jews are going to
[1:19:20] have to run for their bomb shelters
[1:19:21] tonight? He says, no, I don't know
[1:19:22] tonight, tomorrow, next week, next
[1:19:24] month. I'm just saying this is was his
[1:19:26] announcement to the IDF. get ready
[1:19:29] because and and even Trump who was
[1:19:31] bargaining to lift sanctions is now
[1:19:34] saying now they're full of bluster and
[1:19:36] they're saying they slapped America and
[1:19:38] he's got too much ego to swallow that.
[1:19:42] Oh, they slapped America's face. I'm not
[1:19:44] even going to deal with these guys. And
[1:19:46] and and and he's already posting, you
[1:19:48] know, we're going to go back in there
[1:19:50] and bomb them again. We're going to bomb
[1:19:51] them into oblivion. And he'll do it.
[1:19:54] And Israel will sure do it.
[1:19:57] I'm here to tell you there will be no
[1:19:59] peace till Jesus comes.
[1:20:04] And it doesn't matter if they bomb them
[1:20:06] to oblivion and c and cry peace and
[1:20:09] safety. That's the that's the last sign
[1:20:11] they that's one of the last things they
[1:20:13] say. Peace and safety. Then cometh not
[1:20:17] delayed
[1:20:20] sudden
[1:20:21] destruction
[1:20:23] and none shall survi shall survive it.
[1:20:27] So, so these are these are things that
[1:20:30] we're seeing. Men are running to and
[1:20:32] fro. Knowledge is being increased. Uh,
[1:20:35] America's now feared and and and and you
[1:20:38] know, our patriot patriotic heart cuz we
[1:20:41] love our country. Although my country
[1:20:42] died a long time ago, but but that
[1:20:45] patriotism says, "Yeah, you know, we're
[1:20:47] the we're the boss around here. I'm not
[1:20:49] I don't want to be the boss of anything.
[1:20:51] I want to be a humble servant of the
[1:20:53] Lord. I'm looking to get out of here. I
[1:20:54] don't want to stay here and control
[1:20:56] something. I want it to be remodeled and
[1:20:59] renewed.
[1:21:00] Amen. I want to I want there to be
[1:21:03] there's coming a king and he's a
[1:21:05] righteous king and he's going to rule
[1:21:06] the world. They I saw a picture. I
[1:21:08] started to put it on the overhead on the
[1:21:10] wailing wall and they were somebody was
[1:21:12] projecting the Israeli flag and the old
[1:21:15] glory side by side on the wailing wall
[1:21:18] projected showing this great uh uh
[1:21:21] agreement. I'm here to tell you
[1:21:22] something, friends, that every nation in
[1:21:24] the world, including this one, if it's
[1:21:26] still in existence, will compass
[1:21:28] Jerusalem.
[1:21:30] And I'm not so sure that that that that
[1:21:32] would even exclude political Israel, uh,
[1:21:35] coming against the 144,000 because
[1:21:38] that's the only real Israel.
[1:21:41] Uh, I'm not here to take up for the Wall
[1:21:43] Street Jew. I'm not here to take up for
[1:21:46] political Judaism. I'm here to say
[1:21:48] that's God's land and Christ is going to
[1:21:50] set up a throne and he's got 144,000 and
[1:21:54] this thing's going to get going in the
[1:21:56] millennium. I'm not here to support a
[1:21:58] political ideology or an agenda and you
[1:22:01] say, "Oh, don't you support Israel? You
[1:22:03] better believe it." The real one,
[1:22:05] the one that'll be born in a day because
[1:22:07] the bride will go up and the eagle will
[1:22:09] fly east and he'll pick up Moses and
[1:22:11] Elijah and they'll go to their brethren.
[1:22:15] Amen.
[1:22:16] This is happening right now.
[1:22:20] Those prophets are likely already on the
[1:22:22] earth.
[1:22:23] Amen.
[1:22:26] So we find friends
[1:22:29] that the one that left home.
[1:22:34] Oh, brother Jason, how do we navigate
[1:22:36] the chaos and and remain above it? How
[1:22:39] do we how do we overcome the sickness of
[1:22:42] this neurotic age that you read it
[1:22:44] yourself that we seem unfitted for? You
[1:22:47] know, this is the beauty of what brother
[1:22:50] Brandon was bringing out when he says
[1:22:52] the one who left home.
[1:22:55] Only come here to live out a purpose.
[1:22:58] So we were So then, so then we're living
[1:23:01] out our purpose by the under the new
[1:23:03] birth. You weren't living out God's
[1:23:05] purpose before the new birth.
[1:23:06] Amen.
[1:23:06] It was impossible. But Paul said it was
[1:23:09] impossible. The the fallen mind of a man
[1:23:12] is enmity against God. Could never agree
[1:23:14] with God's word. It's why you lived like
[1:23:15] a sinner.
[1:23:16] Amen.
[1:23:17] You knew something was different about
[1:23:18] you. You were never comfortable there.
[1:23:20] If you were, why aren't you still there?
[1:23:22] Amen.
[1:23:23] Why'd you repent and change your life?
[1:23:26] Cuz it you didn't fit. You were
[1:23:28] seemingly unfitted.
[1:23:30] And all your buddies and all your
[1:23:32] friends and all your social media
[1:23:33] friends, they all stayed right with it.
[1:23:35] But somehow you had to make a turn
[1:23:37] northward and you started walking a
[1:23:39] different path. What are you doing? Come
[1:23:41] on. Oh, I can't. I'm sorry. I got to go
[1:23:43] this way. Oh, let's go have fun. That's
[1:23:45] not fun to me anymore. Where are you
[1:23:47] going? I'm marching to Zion.
[1:23:50] Hallelujah.
[1:23:53] Amen. But we find that the way brother
[1:23:55] Brandham is bringing forth out of who is
[1:23:58] this Melzdc when he's bringing forth the
[1:24:00] new birth then we we we find friends
[1:24:03] that we do not acquire the new birth as
[1:24:06] much as we discover it.
[1:24:09] Brother Brandham says you didn't be you
[1:24:10] you didn't become a son or daughter of
[1:24:12] God when you repented at an altar. You
[1:24:14] only discovered you only found out that
[1:24:17] you had always been. So when I when the
[1:24:20] prophet says we find that the one that
[1:24:22] left home, all those who left home, who
[1:24:25] were in a home before this home, raise
[1:24:27] your hand.
[1:24:28] Hallelujah.
[1:24:29] Nine of you.
[1:24:30] How many believe that you started in
[1:24:32] God? How many believe you have a part
[1:24:34] that you're an expression of his word?
[1:24:36] Why do you think you believe his word?
[1:24:38] Amen.
[1:24:39] See,
[1:24:40] so we do not acquire the new birth as
[1:24:43] much as we discover it. We do have to be
[1:24:46] born again.
[1:24:47] Amen.
[1:24:48] And and because I can see that that
[1:24:51] process
[1:24:53] has happened in me, then I'm not I I
[1:24:56] don't I'm not uh my heart is not failing
[1:24:58] for fear. I just read a report just this
[1:25:01] morning about they already know during
[1:25:05] the 20 million or so 10 to 20 million or
[1:25:07] so uh immigrants that they open the
[1:25:11] border and allowed to flood in. They
[1:25:12] already know. It's already confirmed.
[1:25:14] They've already caught some of them.
[1:25:17] where Iranian agents and operatives were
[1:25:20] slipping in
[1:25:22] cuz they're dark-kinned also and they
[1:25:25] were slipping in and they've they've
[1:25:27] actually managed to smuggle in man pads
[1:25:30] shoulder launched air surfaced air
[1:25:32] missiles and they've already caught some
[1:25:35] of their their their distributors and
[1:25:37] their suppliers. They've already
[1:25:39] arrested them and they've already caught
[1:25:40] some and they found them in possession
[1:25:42] of these missiles and they already know
[1:25:44] they haven't caught them all. and the
[1:25:46] the reality that you are facing today
[1:25:49] today uh on June the 29th, Sister Lisa's
[1:25:53] birthday, sis, God bless you. Love you.
[1:25:55] Happy birthday. Uh that in on on in June
[1:25:59] the 29th, 2025,
[1:26:02] know this. When you leave this building,
[1:26:04] there are Iranian terrorist cells in our
[1:26:07] borders that are in possession of
[1:26:09] surfaceto-air missiles.
[1:26:12] That's not conspiracy. that's already
[1:26:15] been confirmed.
[1:26:16] See, so they're they're trying
[1:26:18] desperately to find them. So that's
[1:26:21] that's where we are, friends. Oh, I'm
[1:26:23] I'm glad that I didn't start here. I'm
[1:26:25] glad I'm not finishing here.
[1:26:28] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:26:30] We already have here's another modern
[1:26:32] event. You know, we already have they
[1:26:35] had just announced I saw this uh
[1:26:37] yesterday and then I saw it put in
[1:26:39] popped into our ministers chat. We we've
[1:26:42] now crossed a milestone. Uh Mr. Musk has
[1:26:45] delivered the first fully autonomous
[1:26:48] self-driving car that drove from drove
[1:26:52] from its assembly line when they built
[1:26:54] it, turned it on, put in the address of
[1:26:57] the purchaser. And that car drove out of
[1:27:00] the factory, drove out of the parking
[1:27:01] lot, got onto four-lane interstate
[1:27:04] highways, and drove for hours and drove
[1:27:06] into a city, went off, went into and
[1:27:08] moved through a neighborhood, and pulled
[1:27:10] right up to the front door of the owner.
[1:27:13] And the owner walked out to to find his
[1:27:15] car. Amen.
[1:27:18] I'm here. You know, and and and and you
[1:27:20] you got to realize and say, "Well, yeah,
[1:27:22] but Brother Brandham said, you know, in
[1:27:24] a place where the steering wheel would
[1:27:26] have been and two seats are turned."
[1:27:27] They've they've had that for years. Come
[1:27:30] on, friends. Don't be ridiculous. Don't
[1:27:32] be uh immature to say, "Oh, well, did it
[1:27:34] have to be this little detail?" All of
[1:27:36] it was generalizations.
[1:27:39] He only said Mussolini would come to a
[1:27:41] disgraceful end. He didn't describe how
[1:27:42] that there'd be a mob and they would
[1:27:44] hang them upside down and kill him and
[1:27:46] they'd hang upside down naked in the
[1:27:48] streets.
[1:27:49] He just simply said he'll come to an
[1:27:50] ign, you know, an ignominious end. He'll
[1:27:53] come to a a a shameful end. And he did.
[1:27:56] And he said, you know, this one will
[1:27:58] invade this and then and you say, well,
[1:28:00] but who invaded who and who fired the
[1:28:01] first shot? Like my goodness, how how
[1:28:04] trivial that the fact of the matter is
[1:28:07] every one of those visions came to pass.
[1:28:10] Is that lost on the world? They actually
[1:28:12] happened.
[1:28:14] Women did fall from grace. It didn't
[1:28:17] describe everything they would wear and
[1:28:18] wouldn't wear and less and less and the
[1:28:20] the more the sun comes out, the more the
[1:28:22] clothes come off. It's not it's not that
[1:28:24] kind of a detailed description. You
[1:28:25] don't even find that in the Bible.
[1:28:27] But he did say they would fall from
[1:28:28] grace and they would walk out on the
[1:28:30] streets nearly naked. We're here.
[1:28:33] There'd be driverless cars. We're here.
[1:28:35] And then I saw America blowed to pieces.
[1:28:38] That's the last thing to happen.
[1:28:40] That's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:46] So when brother Brandham comes to
[1:28:48] Melzdc,
[1:28:50] we've talked about this and I don't want
[1:28:52] to reiterate everything that I've
[1:28:54] already said because it's he was a, you
[1:28:56] know, it he was a foreshadowing of
[1:28:58] Christ. And we were trying to get you to
[1:29:00] understand last time that
[1:29:03] perhaps even more important I I I I
[1:29:08] hesitate to say it that way, but at
[1:29:10] least equally as important because I
[1:29:12] don't want to diminish the message that
[1:29:13] that that God brought whenever he
[1:29:15] appeared as Melzdc because his message
[1:29:18] was profound. This time next year Sarah
[1:29:20] will have a son and he and she did and
[1:29:22] that that was the beginning. So, you've
[1:29:24] got a a promised son and then you've got
[1:29:26] the son of promise and one is Isaac and
[1:29:29] one is actually Jesus. And I'm not here
[1:29:30] to break all that down, but but we find
[1:29:33] out that that the the thing that was
[1:29:36] brother Brandon was trying to bring to
[1:29:39] the world's attention is is that wasn't
[1:29:41] just a prefigure of Christ. That was God
[1:29:45] interacting with humanity.
[1:29:47] Amen.
[1:29:48] And God was interacting with humanity
[1:29:50] when Joshua ran into him. That was God
[1:29:54] interacting with humanity. You
[1:29:56] understand? And that that's what's
[1:29:58] happened today. God has interacted with
[1:30:02] humanity.
[1:30:03] It was God interacting with humanity
[1:30:06] when he knocked Paul out of the saddle.
[1:30:08] Amen.
[1:30:08] And a voice spoke and said, "This is
[1:30:10] this is what's happening. This is who
[1:30:12] you are and this is what you need to
[1:30:13] do." And we find out that God promised
[1:30:16] that day would come back again. God has
[1:30:18] come again. The the mighty angel has
[1:30:21] given us his word which is him
[1:30:24] and has given it to you which makes you
[1:30:25] a part of him.
[1:30:27] It didn't create you into a part of him.
[1:30:29] It identified that you always were a
[1:30:31] part of him.
[1:30:33] And so now the word is made flesh. Luke
[1:30:36] 17:30 as it was in the days of Lot. And
[1:30:40] that's the ministry of the son of man.
[1:30:41] So shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:30:43] of man. I'm looking at the ministry of
[1:30:45] the son of man.
[1:30:47] Amen.
[1:30:48] Amen. That's right.
[1:30:49] So all kinds, you know, of you have so
[1:30:52] many of the 33,000 I hear it's way more
[1:30:55] than that even now with symbols
[1:30:58] associated with Christian religion. The
[1:30:59] Jews have the same thing. It's not new.
[1:31:01] That's not new. The symbols of Christian
[1:31:04] religion, symbols of Judy, Judaism that
[1:31:06] in every age, the Old Testament, New
[1:31:08] Testament, all parallels.
[1:31:10] But but but to the elect lady, as John
[1:31:13] would call her,
[1:31:15] to the elect, it's more than just
[1:31:17] symbols of Christianity. And I sure hope
[1:31:21] that the message of the hour is more to
[1:31:24] you than a belt buckle, a bolt off of a
[1:31:28] car, driving a Ford. What? What? What?
[1:31:31] What? I hope it's more than that. I hope
[1:31:34] it's more than a replicated briefcase
[1:31:36] you can get. I hope it's more than that.
[1:31:38] I hope it's more than just gathering a
[1:31:41] people uh a playing a tape that as good
[1:31:44] as that is. That's wonderful. Would to
[1:31:47] God we all do that all the time. In
[1:31:49] fact, I do do that all the time. I
[1:31:51] gather and push play every day. A tape a
[1:31:54] day will keep the devil away. I'm here
[1:31:56] to tell you something, friends. That's
[1:31:57] wonderful. But that's not a that's not a
[1:31:59] full substitute for the body of
[1:32:02] believers to gather and bring all of
[1:32:04] their licks of fire
[1:32:06] and be able to have the Holy Spirit
[1:32:08] moving and be instructed in the word of
[1:32:10] God. Neither it's it's a it's it works
[1:32:14] if you're in a situation where you can't
[1:32:16] travel all the time to a church. We've
[1:32:19] got people who stream. I understand
[1:32:20] that. But when you've got a church right
[1:32:22] in your own city with people full of the
[1:32:24] Holy Ghost who love God and the word's
[1:32:26] going forth and you choose to sit home
[1:32:27] and stream a service, are you kidding
[1:32:29] me?
[1:32:30] Come on.
[1:32:31] I'm not sure you're even a Christian.
[1:32:35] When you make that choice,
[1:32:37] but I'm not your judge.
[1:32:39] I'm just saying
[1:32:40] what Paul said.
[1:32:42] You gather together
[1:32:44] as you see the day approaching. Maybe
[1:32:46] maybe you don't see the day approaching.
[1:32:48] I don't know. And I get it. We have we
[1:32:50] have families who are in that situation.
[1:32:52] Brother Rodney and sister Lois are in a
[1:32:54] very similar situation. But brother
[1:32:56] Rodney's also part of another assembly
[1:32:58] that he helps with. And and and don't
[1:33:00] get me started on the on uh Brother
[1:33:02] Rodney like sister Jean is like
[1:33:03] evangelist in the in the Pilgrim's
[1:33:05] Progress. Anytime somebody's got a
[1:33:07] problem, Brother Rodney just like steps
[1:33:08] out of thin air and starts talking to
[1:33:10] them. Amen. Some people could be in a
[1:33:13] grocery line thinking they're ready to
[1:33:14] take their life and turn around and
[1:33:16] Sister Jean don't need no intro. She'll
[1:33:18] just start talking to you about the
[1:33:19] Lord.
[1:33:22] Oh, would the God God had more servants
[1:33:24] like that?
[1:33:26] Amen.
[1:33:27] Amen.
[1:33:30] So, we want more than just symbols of
[1:33:34] religion, symbols of Christianity.
[1:33:37] We want it to become an experience.
[1:33:40] And and and in that experience, we
[1:33:43] realize that it's a
[1:33:47] there's an affinity that you have with
[1:33:51] the being of the word that you have a
[1:33:53] hard time explaining to someone who's
[1:33:55] never had the experience.
[1:33:57] And you're you're you're it's often
[1:33:59] times they just want to know, well, what
[1:34:00] is your doctrine? What do you believe?
[1:34:01] And you're trying to explain it to them,
[1:34:03] but you already know in the back of your
[1:34:04] mind, no, it's more than doctrine. I if
[1:34:07] I can figure out a way to explain to you
[1:34:09] there's a there's an affinity. Oh, give
[1:34:12] me a better language. Well, uh there's a
[1:34:14] gene like you were a gene in your
[1:34:15] father. You were a gene in in God. And
[1:34:18] and this is what brother Brandon was
[1:34:19] even trying to put it into words to get
[1:34:21] you to understand like so that you have
[1:34:24] this kind of will conquering strength
[1:34:26] Jesus had because he didn't bypass his
[1:34:28] theophony. You did.
[1:34:31] So in that form he knowed all things.
[1:34:33] When he come as a human, he didn't know
[1:34:35] everything that would happen to him as a
[1:34:36] human. He didn't know who touched him
[1:34:38] and various things he didn't know. But
[1:34:40] what he did know, he had a revelation of
[1:34:42] who he was and where he came from and
[1:34:43] where he was going.
[1:34:45] See,
[1:34:46] and that was that was will conquering
[1:34:48] for him. So that's why brother Brandon
[1:34:50] would say there's no nothing apart from
[1:34:52] re of revelation that's so powerful to
[1:34:55] give you power to be an overcomer. When
[1:34:57] you start to realize who I am, why I am,
[1:35:00] why I'm here, what's up. Amen.
[1:35:03] See,
[1:35:05] and so you realize that
[1:35:08] that that that you're actually a part of
[1:35:11] him. And with that, you recognize that
[1:35:14] this is how you recognize him.
[1:35:17] And this is how fallen humanity uh the
[1:35:22] nature
[1:35:23] is is is s the old fallen nature gets
[1:35:27] supernaturally destroyed. Say, "How did
[1:35:31] you become a Christian?" Uh, "Did you
[1:35:34] join a church, sign a pledge?" No. How
[1:35:37] did you become a Christian? An alien
[1:35:40] force supernaturally destroyed my old
[1:35:42] nature, and now I love God.
[1:35:44] Glory.
[1:35:46] Amen.
[1:35:48] Wait, what? Yeah. Don't ask me to repeat
[1:35:50] that. I barely got it out.
[1:35:55] So, well, what are you now? Well, are
[1:35:59] you a denomination? No. Are you Are you
[1:36:04] What's your credo? I don't have one.
[1:36:07] What about your membership? We don't
[1:36:09] have one. Wh What are you? Well, I'm
[1:36:14] what I was always intended to be.
[1:36:19] Explain that deeper. I wish I could. I
[1:36:21] don't always understand it myself, but I
[1:36:23] know when I come up against the word of
[1:36:25] God, I can't cross it. And I know when I
[1:36:27] come to face something in the world, I
[1:36:29] can't cross that. I love God. I just do.
[1:36:31] I love him. I love his word. I love
[1:36:32] everything about him. I want to be like
[1:36:34] him.
[1:36:35] I have an affinity with him. I I I I
[1:36:37] didn't find out that I was a son of God.
[1:36:39] I only found out I was always that.
[1:36:43] Praise God.
[1:36:45] Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:46] Brother Brander says, "You were there in
[1:36:48] his attributes." This is from Who's
[1:36:50] Melzdc.c You don't remember it. No,
[1:36:53] because you're just a part of his life.
[1:36:55] You are a part of God when you become a
[1:36:58] son or a daughter of God just as you are
[1:37:00] part of your earthly father. So this
[1:37:02] statement certainly challenged the
[1:37:04] conventional understanding uh uh that
[1:37:07] that human uh that that that that human
[1:37:11] existence
[1:37:13] begins at conception.
[1:37:16] Amen.
[1:37:17] human my human existence
[1:37:20] who I really am not this temple you see
[1:37:23] but the real me is not tied to human
[1:37:28] conception I didn't begin at human
[1:37:30] conception
[1:37:33] I was all I didn't fact is I didn't
[1:37:35] begin
[1:37:37] when did you start I didn't when do you
[1:37:39] end I can't
[1:37:41] explain that I was if I could explain
[1:37:43] that I could explain God he always was I
[1:37:46] always was in him.
[1:37:48] See,
[1:37:49] so so then we realize then that our
[1:37:52] deepest identity exists in God's
[1:37:56] existing in God's mind as brother
[1:37:57] Brandon would explain it and that's why
[1:37:59] the Bible says before the foundation of
[1:38:01] the world not as a possibility. I wasn't
[1:38:05] in the lamb's book of life before the
[1:38:07] foundation of the world as a possibility
[1:38:10] that if the stars line up and I and I
[1:38:12] check all the boxes and I do a certain
[1:38:14] thing, I'll become a son of God. It had
[1:38:16] nothing to do with a possibility. It was
[1:38:18] going to be it was always going to be
[1:38:20] and is an expression of God's life.
[1:38:25] You always was. That's a that's a
[1:38:27] Kentucky way to say it. You always was.
[1:38:31] Brother Brandham says, "If you have
[1:38:32] eternal life, you always was."
[1:38:36] Now, now let me He started really trying
[1:38:40] to get his mind around this kind of
[1:38:42] language. He started actually all the
[1:38:45] way back and there's even earlier
[1:38:47] indirect ways. I've just picked this
[1:38:48] one. Um, Brother Brandham is trying to
[1:38:52] explain why there's no eternal hell. So,
[1:38:56] he says there's no scripture that says
[1:38:58] there's an eternal hell. This is why I'm
[1:38:59] against organized religion. November the
[1:39:01] 11th, 1962. Eternal never did begin.
[1:39:04] Neither does it ever end. So the Bible
[1:39:05] said hell was created for the devil and
[1:39:07] his angels. So it isn't eternal. There
[1:39:09] was a time when it wasn't. And there
[1:39:11] will be a time when it's not again. But
[1:39:13] they may be punished in there through
[1:39:15] fire and brimstone and pits of fire and
[1:39:16] aons of time, but it will finally end
[1:39:18] because hell is not eternal. See, the
[1:39:20] Bible says it was created for the devil
[1:39:22] and his angels. And if there and if now
[1:39:24] watch this, he's going to really flip
[1:39:26] it. The other side of the coin is even
[1:39:28] more profound. If there was an eternal
[1:39:30] hell, you'd have to have eternal life to
[1:39:32] live in an eternal hell. And if it was
[1:39:35] eternal, it always was. And you always
[1:39:38] was in hell.
[1:39:42] And you'll always be in hell.
[1:39:46] If hell is eternal, say that the next
[1:39:48] time somebody says eternal hell, say,
[1:39:50] "If hell is eternal, you always was in
[1:39:52] hell and you always will be." Yeah.
[1:39:54] See,
[1:39:55] so he says,
[1:39:58] see, there there there is no such a
[1:40:01] thing. He comes on later in December
[1:40:04] 1962. Now, he's going to talk about and
[1:40:06] try to put into words and encapsulate
[1:40:08] the eternal God. We truly know, he's in
[1:40:11] a prayer, that thou art God. And we
[1:40:14] truly know, thou art the one who lived
[1:40:17] in a days gone by, but yet you live
[1:40:19] today. You always was God. You always
[1:40:23] will be God. You were God before time
[1:40:27] and you'll be God when there is no more
[1:40:30] time. You'll still be God.
[1:40:33] Now, he's going to come after the seals
[1:40:35] and he's going to begin to take that
[1:40:37] kind of a concept and bring that down to
[1:40:41] the continuation of Christ, which is
[1:40:43] what you are.
[1:40:44] See, remember there's only according to
[1:40:46] Isaiah 42, there's only one elected son.
[1:40:48] Amen.
[1:40:49] How I got elected is because I was in
[1:40:51] him. Yeah.
[1:40:52] See, I'm an expression. I'm the
[1:40:53] continuation of of Christ in expression.
[1:40:57] So now he comes in 1964. When their eyes
[1:41:00] were open, they knew him.
[1:41:03] Therefore, your name was in his
[1:41:06] thinking. This is prior to who is this
[1:41:08] MelzDC. Your name was in his thinking.
[1:41:12] That's how you have eternal life. That's
[1:41:14] how you have eternal life. Your name was
[1:41:16] in his thinking.
[1:41:17] Amen.
[1:41:18] Amen.
[1:41:18] That's right.
[1:41:19] Don't worry about this. Uh Matt and I
[1:41:21] are just trying to get this correct.
[1:41:23] Trying some new devices. We don't like
[1:41:25] it, we'll chug it, get another one.
[1:41:27] That's how you have eternal life. We'll
[1:41:29] return it, get a refund, buy another
[1:41:30] one. Amen.
[1:41:34] Yeah. I don't want you to think I'm
[1:41:35] being frivolous. Your name was in his
[1:41:37] thinking. That's how you have eternal
[1:41:38] life. You can't have it no other way.
[1:41:43] If you got eternal life, you always was.
[1:41:46] If otherwise you just can't say, "Well,
[1:41:48] I belong to a church. I do this." No,
[1:41:51] sir. Anything that was eternal never did
[1:41:55] begin and cannot end. So you were only
[1:41:57] in his thinking your name, who you are,
[1:42:00] and what you are. That's the only way
[1:42:02] you could ever have eternal life cuz you
[1:42:04] always was.
[1:42:07] He comes later, sir is sers, we would
[1:42:10] see Jesus. This is about a week later,
[1:42:13] 1964. Then remember, if you ever was in
[1:42:16] God's thinking, ah, you'll always be
[1:42:20] there.
[1:42:22] Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:23] That means that I can't fail my way out
[1:42:24] of it.
[1:42:27] Hallelujah.
[1:42:28] If you ever was in God's thinking, we
[1:42:30] say, "Were you in his thinking?" I
[1:42:32] believe I was. Well, what's your
[1:42:33] evidence? I believe his word, and it
[1:42:35] consumes my whole life. So, I have every
[1:42:38] every evidence. What's the evidence of
[1:42:39] the new birth? I say amen to every word
[1:42:42] from my heart.
[1:42:45] See, and and so if you was ever in God's
[1:42:49] thinking, you always you'll always be
[1:42:52] there. If you've got eternal life, you
[1:42:55] are the expression or the attribute of
[1:42:57] his thought for this age. There is only
[1:43:00] one eternal life and it always existed.
[1:43:02] And you in his mind existed before there
[1:43:06] was a world. That's the reason he said
[1:43:09] he chose you before the foundation of
[1:43:12] the world. It isn't what you think what
[1:43:15] somebody else thinks. It's what God
[1:43:18] eternal you always was see in his
[1:43:20] thinking. I don't always think like
[1:43:23] maybe I am. And probably there's people
[1:43:25] who know me probably definitely don't
[1:43:27] think that I am. But I don't care what I
[1:43:30] think and I don't care what they think.
[1:43:32] I only care what he thinks. And when he
[1:43:35] has revealed his word to me, then I'm
[1:43:37] just going to believe him.
[1:43:39] I'm going to believe that I'll be there
[1:43:41] because I only left there and came here
[1:43:43] for a purpose. And I go back there.
[1:43:48] Amen.
[1:43:49] Now he comes again. This is uh 6 months
[1:43:51] about five months later, 1964.
[1:43:55] Eternal life. You always was. So you
[1:43:58] have eternal life. There's only one form
[1:44:00] of it. That's God. You were his
[1:44:01] attribute. I thought he thought of you
[1:44:03] and knowed you before the foundation of
[1:44:05] the world in his mind. See, so so when
[1:44:08] we when we think about this here, here's
[1:44:11] here's the I suppose here's the point
[1:44:13] that I'm is about as far as I'm going to
[1:44:15] get today. I'm five I got five minutes.
[1:44:18] So I I want you to come to this.
[1:44:22] When you hear a prophet make these kinds
[1:44:25] of statements, then I realize that that
[1:44:28] our earthly existence
[1:44:32] is is not
[1:44:34] the beginning of our story.
[1:44:36] Amen.
[1:44:38] Amen.
[1:44:38] It's actually a chapter in an eternal
[1:44:42] narrative
[1:44:43] that began in God.
[1:44:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:44:46] Say that again. my life here. I was born
[1:44:49] August the 4th, 1963. Sister Jean can
[1:44:52] attest to it. She went through the
[1:44:55] labor. Trust me, I got here.
[1:44:59] That's not when I started.
[1:45:02] Therefore,
[1:45:04] why would all of my failures
[1:45:08] in this temporary existence, how would
[1:45:10] that knock me out? You see the lie the
[1:45:13] devil is constantly telling you
[1:45:16] that you've got to somehow earn your way
[1:45:18] or achieve it or check a box or or
[1:45:20] somehow you've got to have some kind of
[1:45:22] victory. I will put no other burden upon
[1:45:25] you but that you say amen to every word.
[1:45:29] Say, "Don't I have to live as an
[1:45:30] overcomer?" Trust me, you will. Because
[1:45:33] when that seed gene comes to life, it'll
[1:45:36] change your whole nature. The greatest
[1:45:38] battle ever fought starts on that day.
[1:45:41] Yes,
[1:45:42] that's that's that they've got a date
[1:45:44] when World War I started, who fired the
[1:45:46] first shot, World War II started, 1939,
[1:45:49] and and and Hitler's invading this and
[1:45:51] invading that one. And finally, he
[1:45:52] crosses into Poland. Brother Matt and I,
[1:45:54] Sister Me, and Sister Zoe were there at
[1:45:56] the radio station where the whole false
[1:45:58] flag thing took place, which used to be
[1:46:00] part of Germany and reparations. They
[1:46:02] gave it to Poland after the war. It
[1:46:04] started right there. They've got
[1:46:05] pictures of the of the German of the
[1:46:07] German army coming through and Poland
[1:46:09] fought. They fought bravely. They were
[1:46:11] no match. They got blitzkrieged. And
[1:46:13] then and then England because of their
[1:46:15] treaties was obligated. Then France was
[1:46:16] obligated. Then everything, you know,
[1:46:17] then the whole thing went and suddenly
[1:46:19] we're in another world war that
[1:46:20] everybody tried. They fought World War I
[1:46:23] and called it the war to end all wars.
[1:46:26] What a joke. It was not only could it
[1:46:29] not end all wars, it was never going to
[1:46:31] end all wars because it was only the
[1:46:33] first woe. There were two more coming
[1:46:35] and nothing could stop them. And nothing
[1:46:37] could stop World War II. And nothing
[1:46:39] will stop World War II.
[1:46:41] And if that's the case, nothing will
[1:46:43] stop the rapture. And if that's the
[1:46:44] case, nothing will stop me. Nothing will
[1:46:46] stop you. I'm part of an eternal
[1:46:49] expression.
[1:46:50] Hallelujah.
[1:46:52] Hallelujah. Friends, this is the faith
[1:46:53] that I have. I didn't start here. I'm
[1:46:55] not finishing here. My life didn't begin
[1:46:58] my It's not a book of my life at
[1:47:00] conception. It's merely a chapter in the
[1:47:03] book of life of God. I'm a chapter.
[1:47:07] Hallelujah.
[1:47:08] You're a chapter. It's already written.
[1:47:13] It's not being pinned. It's already
[1:47:15] pinned.
[1:47:16] Your life is simply coming daily and
[1:47:19] daily and daily by prayer, by
[1:47:21] dedication, by by coming to church, by
[1:47:24] reading your Bible, by playing the
[1:47:25] taste, by fellowshipping. It all comes
[1:47:27] together to bring my life in agreement,
[1:47:31] in alignment. I'm returning back to
[1:47:33] something.
[1:47:34] Amen.
[1:47:35] Amen.
[1:47:36] Amen. Amen.
[1:47:38] The process is underway and
[1:47:42] irreversible.
[1:47:44] Amen.
[1:47:44] 1965
[1:47:47] just before who is this Melzdc.
[1:47:51] Now, if you've got eternal life, uh,
[1:47:53] brother Anthony, get ready to come. Now,
[1:47:55] if you've got eternal life tonight,
[1:47:59] if we have eternal life, then we always
[1:48:02] were because there's only one form of
[1:48:05] eternal life. We always were. Okay.
[1:48:09] Very, very good. Thank you. We always
[1:48:11] were. And the reason we were
[1:48:15] because we are a part of God.
[1:48:20] And God is the only thing that's
[1:48:22] eternal.
[1:48:24] Amen. I'm so glad that I didn't read.
[1:48:27] And the only reason we were is because
[1:48:30] we lived a perfect life. We never made a
[1:48:34] mistake.
[1:48:35] That is nowhere in this quote or any
[1:48:39] quote.
[1:48:40] See, and and brother Brandham in in one
[1:48:43] sense talks about he's waiting on the
[1:48:45] the readiness of the bride. I get that.
[1:48:47] But that's only to that that only is
[1:48:49] dispensational truth because brother
[1:48:50] Brandon would say it's not your
[1:48:51] readiness that brings the rapture. It's
[1:48:54] it's his time. It's his time piece. He's
[1:48:57] keeping time. He's got a calendar. And
[1:49:00] it won't be your readiness to do that.
[1:49:01] See, but in but in but in a
[1:49:03] dispensational way, yes, it is the
[1:49:05] readiness. Meaning that the bride had
[1:49:07] she couldn't go raptured in the sixth
[1:49:09] age or at a she didn't go in the
[1:49:12] rapture. She couldn't. She couldn't go
[1:49:14] in the rapture at the opening of the
[1:49:15] seals. I had to be here. You had to be
[1:49:18] here. You had to be here today believing
[1:49:20] this message saying, "I'm a part of
[1:49:22] something larger than me." And I didn't
[1:49:24] start here. This this is not a a book
[1:49:26] about my life. This is only a chapter in
[1:49:28] an eternal narrative. Hallelujah,
[1:49:31] friends.
[1:49:32] Oh, let's stand to our feet. God bless
[1:49:34] you. I can't go any further. I got so
[1:49:36] much more I want to say, but
[1:49:39] we'll get to it at a later time. Praise
[1:49:41] the Lord. Brother uh Matt's coming and
[1:49:43] the musicians are coming. Oh my. I want
[1:49:46] to uh
[1:49:48] sing uh This is the evening time. It's
[1:49:50] later than you think. Amen.
[1:49:52] Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:49:54] Amen. We got a half a music crew here
[1:49:57] today.
[1:49:58] This is the evening time. It's greater
[1:50:01] than you think. Amen. So, uh, we're
[1:50:04] missing a piano player. Are you playing
[1:50:05] piano, Sister Ruth, or Oh, she's she's
[1:50:08] coming. Very good. Amen. You love the
[1:50:10] Lord.
[1:50:11] I love him with all of my heart. I I got
[1:50:15] a um Yeah, very good. I got a uh this
[1:50:19] request. Um, sorry this is last minute.
[1:50:22] Uh, this is from brother Kenny. We need
[1:50:24] prayer. We are having troubles finding
[1:50:26] an insurance company to provide us
[1:50:28] coverage. Asking the Lord Jesus to
[1:50:30] protect his future business location and
[1:50:32] help provide good coverage at a good
[1:50:34] rate. Trusting him for in capital
[1:50:36] letters all things. Amen. That's where I
[1:50:40] want my faith to be, friends. Trusting
[1:50:42] the Lord for all things. I trust him.
[1:50:44] Don't you?
[1:50:45] Amen. Praise the Lord. You know the key
[1:50:47] that that goes in, Sister Ruth, this is
[1:50:49] the evening time. It's later than you
[1:50:51] think. Amen.
[1:50:54] That sounds like it.
[1:50:58] It's later than you think.
[1:51:02] That might be a little low. We'll keep
[1:51:03] trying.
[1:51:04] The bride is preparing
[1:51:08] now
[1:51:10] for her Lord to me.
[1:51:14] We might need to go with this a hair
[1:51:15] depth. All things are ready. All things
[1:51:19] are ready.
[1:51:20] Ready. Now

[1:51:57] now. For the Lord.
[1:51:59] For her, Lord. To me.

[1:52:30] one more time. Listen to the evening
[1:52:32] time. Come on believers, lift it up.
[1:52:35] This is fake
[1:52:38] time.

[1:53:04] ready now.
[1:53:06] My my
[1:53:09] bridegroom my ear.

[1:53:41] Are you preparing the bride is preparing
[1:53:46] now?
[1:53:47] Oh, be prepared for her Lord to be.
[1:53:54] Men have run to and fro. Knowledge is
[1:53:56] increased. things are ready
[1:54:00] now. The word is in its fullness. The
[1:54:03] bride groom I hear. Hallelujah. The
[1:54:08] millennium's coming, friends. Oh, he
[1:54:10] that hath an ear to hear. The evening
[1:54:16] time
[1:54:19] is here.
[1:54:21] Bow your heads with me across the
[1:54:23] building. Let me pray for you one more
[1:54:24] time before we go.
[1:54:27] Lord, these are important times, Lord.
[1:54:30] They're times that have been on the
[1:54:32] books. We're seeing prophecies, Lord,
[1:54:34] that have been on the books for hundreds
[1:54:37] and even thousands of years. We're
[1:54:39] seeing them come to pass. They're
[1:54:41] happening all around us. Truly, Lord,
[1:54:44] the the word made flesh and a bride, the
[1:54:47] ministry of the son of man living in the
[1:54:49] earth is the last sign that the earth
[1:54:52] will ever see. We're here, Lord, to
[1:54:55] demonstrate
[1:54:57] what thus sayaeth the Lord is in our
[1:55:00] lives.
[1:55:02] How we live, how we conduct ourselves,
[1:55:06] how we handle business, careers,
[1:55:09] recreation, entertainment, marriages,
[1:55:13] relationships,
[1:55:15] everything, Lord God, everything that we
[1:55:17] are connected to in this world. You
[1:55:20] didn't tell us to go live in a commune.
[1:55:22] That was never going to be your plan.
[1:55:24] You wanted us living in the world. Only
[1:55:26] don't live as part of the world. Paul
[1:55:28] said you you don't abuse it. You are
[1:55:31] here, but you're you didn't start here.
[1:55:35] Lord, we started in you. And we find
[1:55:37] that the one who left home only came
[1:55:40] here to serve your purpose and then is
[1:55:43] recalled and then is brought back in a
[1:55:46] glorified state. While I'm here, Lord,
[1:55:48] help me to be a final voice in this age.
[1:55:52] Let my life be pleasing to you. Let my
[1:55:55] goals, all my aspirations, my dreams, my
[1:55:57] pursuits. Nothing wrong with that, Lord.
[1:56:00] You want us to be up and at it. You you
[1:56:03] you don't like laziness. You You want
[1:56:06] accomplishment. Nothing wrong with that.
[1:56:08] That that opens up channels and opens
[1:56:10] doors for us to be a greater witness in
[1:56:12] the world. Just just may we keep our
[1:56:15] priorities straight that you must remain
[1:56:18] at the center of it all. You must live
[1:56:21] in the center of my heart pulling the
[1:56:24] levers turning the knobs adjusting Lord
[1:56:27] everything so that my daily everyday
[1:56:30] walking talking life is a reflection of
[1:56:34] your life from inside. Grant it Lord
[1:56:36] grant it. Help us today. I don't think
[1:56:39] there be any doubt Lord. We should never
[1:56:42] from today, Lord. And there's even more
[1:56:44] to say, but there's been enough said
[1:56:46] today. We should never again allow the
[1:56:49] devil to grip us in fear because of our
[1:56:52] weaknesses, our failures, our missteps,
[1:56:55] our transgressions. We have them. We
[1:56:58] will have them. That's not the point.
[1:57:00] The point is is our trust in that
[1:57:02] eternal purpose of God. Is my trust in
[1:57:05] your word. Am I willing to come back
[1:57:07] again and pledge my allegiance to the
[1:57:10] word every time I fail? Am I willing to
[1:57:12] come back and pledge my allegiance again
[1:57:15] and go forward? Lord, I believe that for
[1:57:18] your family, this is the consummation of
[1:57:22] all the ages and we want to be marching
[1:57:25] in step to the gospel. I want my life to
[1:57:28] be in harmony to that word. I know, I
[1:57:31] can already see that the world is
[1:57:33] fulfilling the prophecies of men running
[1:57:36] to and fro. It's already fulfilling
[1:57:38] knowledge shall be increased. It's
[1:57:40] already fulfilling that darkness covers
[1:57:43] the earth.
[1:57:45] We can we can see that. There's no
[1:57:46] question that that the minds of man are
[1:57:49] covered in gross darkness. That's not in
[1:57:51] question. We can see that. We live in
[1:57:52] it. We swim around in it every day. We
[1:57:55] can see that there is a impersonation of
[1:57:58] Christianity. It's not hard to spot.
[1:58:00] It's It's 33,000
[1:58:04] different variations and impersonations
[1:58:07] of the real original gospel. That
[1:58:09] doesn't trouble us. I'm not here to
[1:58:11] fight that battle. That's going to be I
[1:58:12] can't even make that go away. No sense
[1:58:15] fighting against it. I just want to know
[1:58:17] that my life is reflecting your word for
[1:58:21] this hour. That is the best thing that I
[1:58:24] can do for my family, for my friends,
[1:58:27] for those who are lost without you and
[1:58:29] don't know you. Those who are trapped in
[1:58:31] denominational barnyards who need
[1:58:32] freedom and need deliverance. That's the
[1:58:35] best thing they can get is to see our
[1:58:38] lives marching in the step of the
[1:58:41] gospel.
[1:58:43] Smooth, clean, marching to the step of
[1:58:45] the gospel. Instead of going down, they
[1:58:47] started going up. Lord, I want that to
[1:58:49] be my life. I want my life to be in the
[1:58:51] order of ascension. I'm going up. I'm
[1:58:53] climbing Zion. Lord, climbing to the
[1:58:55] top. I thank you for it now. I commit
[1:58:58] this audience into your hands. The
[1:59:00] visible audience, the audience across
[1:59:02] the airwaves. There's more to say. We
[1:59:04] will say it if you give us life and
[1:59:06] breath. Uh and but Father, as far as
[1:59:10] we're concerned, we could all meet you
[1:59:12] in the morning. That would be just fine.
[1:59:14] Oh lamb of God, help us now to be in
[1:59:17] your perfect will in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1:59:21] Amen. We're going to let you go,
[1:59:22] friends. I'm glad you were in the house
[1:59:23] of God today. Thank you for coming.
[1:59:26] Amen. And listening so attentively. I
[1:59:28] love the response I get from this
[1:59:30] audience. Amen. God bless you. Turn
[1:59:32] around, shake hands one more time with
[1:59:34] somebody. You can be dismissed in Jesus
[1:59:36] name.
[1:59:40] God bless you.
[1:59:42] You got to keep pressing on.

[2:00:53] Well, Satan tries to stop me,
[2:00:57] turn me aside,
[2:01:00] says no need for me to go.
[2:01:03] Don't even try.
[2:01:07] Even if there was a rapture, you'd never
[2:01:10] make it in.
[2:01:13] I just say, Satan, that proves you're a
[2:01:17] liar again. I'm going to keep pressing
[2:01:20] on
[2:01:23] on and on and on,
[2:01:26] pressing on.
[2:01:29] [Music]
[2:01:31] I'm going to keep pressing on
[2:01:35] to the higher calling of my Lord.
[2:01:43] Oh,
[2:01:45] pressing on.
[2:01:48] [Music]

[2:02:24] Oh, I
[2:02:26] I want to be ready.
[2:02:29] [Applause]
[2:02:30] [Music]
[2:02:31] I'm
[2:02:34] going to be ready
