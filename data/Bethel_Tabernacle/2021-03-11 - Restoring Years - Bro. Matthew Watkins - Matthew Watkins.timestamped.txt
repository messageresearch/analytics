[47:59] that we have here tonight
[48:01] and just focus in on you lord for what
[48:03] you would want to say
[48:05] we ask it in jesus christ's name amen
[48:08] you can be seated here tonight
[48:21] i like and i don't have these i wish
[48:24] that we did have time to put them on the
[48:25] screen i'm just going to read you
[48:27] amen a few things that the prophet of
[48:29] god had to say about this
[48:31] but it's amazing when you look at this
[48:34] uh this book of joel
[48:36] and and i believe that we have so much
[48:39] that we
[48:40] have been given by the message of the
[48:42] hour amen about this whatever you just
[48:44] did on the adjustment
[48:45] uh undo it i can't hear myself now i
[48:48] might need to just turn
[48:49] this there it's amazing when you look at
[48:52] this book of joel
[48:54] and he comes 10 years after obadiah
[48:57] and the bible tells us that he joel's
[49:00] message is going to speak
[49:02] specifically to the southern kingdom of
[49:05] judah
[49:06] and we don't have time especially on a
[49:08] wednesday to teach too much in this but
[49:10] i believe it's really elementary for
[49:13] most of us knowing that
[49:15] israel split into two kingdoms and so
[49:19] joel's message is going to come
[49:20] specifically to the southern kingdom
[49:23] it doesn't reference the northern tribes
[49:25] at all
[49:26] but the bible speaks of this in the time
[49:29] the scripture says about the time we
[49:32] would guess
[49:32] the dates would be around the time of
[49:35] king uzziah and we all remember that
[49:38] king really well
[49:39] uzziah king uzziah was a prosperous man
[49:44] israel enjoyed the prosperity and the
[49:48] success
[49:49] of this godly man for most of his life
[49:52] and you remember that in isaiah 6
[49:55] isaiah begins to prophesy and he says
[49:58] that that the year that the king you
[50:00] he says the year that king uzziah died
[50:04] i saw the lord seated on a throne high
[50:07] and exalted
[50:08] and so this was this was what what
[50:11] isaiah
[50:12] is saying directly or indirectly was
[50:15] that with the death of
[50:16] king uzziah judah lost their king
[50:20] and and and and they lost that golden
[50:23] period that
[50:24] monarchy of of great uh success
[50:27] and and great prosperity and and there
[50:30] was really
[50:30] after uzziah there was no king uh for
[50:34] for judah after uzziah
[50:36] and at that time isaiah isaiah it says
[50:39] but i seen
[50:40] the lord high and lifted up so
[50:43] when man's kingdom ends god's kingdom
[50:46] begins
[50:47] and so when when uzziah dies isaiah says
[50:51] in the year that king uzziah died i seen
[50:54] the real king the real
[50:55] monarch the real amen uh king
[50:58] judah had lost a king but they had been
[51:00] given the real king
[51:02] i'm glad we have that king in our hearts
[51:04] here tonight
[51:06] and so that means that joel lives during
[51:08] this period
[51:09] in uh of this golden age of of uzziah
[51:13] and he's going to rule for 52 years
[51:17] uzziah is going to rule and the bible
[51:20] records
[51:21] in those 52 years that for israel this
[51:24] is a great time of great
[51:26] success of great blessing
[51:30] great bounty and every aspect when you
[51:34] study historically
[51:35] israel was uh had was in a season
[51:40] not just uh monetarily not just with
[51:42] money but their military
[51:44] was stronger than it it had ever been
[51:46] before their the administration that
[51:48] they were under the
[51:50] uh economically commercially industry
[51:53] everything was really going really good
[51:56] uh these would be what you'd call years
[51:59] of the bible would
[52:00] would call years of fatness and years of
[52:03] plenty
[52:04] and the bible says and it speaks of king
[52:06] uzziah in second chronicles you don't
[52:08] have to turn
[52:09] chapter 26 it says his fame spread as
[52:13] far as the border of
[52:14] egypt because he had became very
[52:17] powerful it says his fame and spread
[52:20] far and wide he was greatly helped and
[52:23] became
[52:24] very power powerful second only
[52:26] historians will say
[52:28] that this time of prosperity is second
[52:31] only
[52:31] to king solomon and so it was a great
[52:35] time and joel
[52:36] mentions this and is when you read joel
[52:38] 1
[52:39] and and as he begins to prophesy he
[52:41] mentions this great time
[52:43] of prosperity where their vats were now
[52:46] that's not what we read in joel 2 but
[52:49] this when before joel's prophecy starts
[52:52] to go
[52:52] forth i'm letting you understand the
[52:54] setting that god's people were under
[52:57] because the message that you read that
[52:59] comes to
[53:00] israel deals directly more
[53:04] not so much with their physical
[53:06] condition
[53:07] or their natural condition but god's
[53:11] word
[53:11] always speaks to the spiritual condition
[53:16] you see to god your spiritual condition
[53:20] is really all that really matters
[53:23] now our physical life and our emotional
[53:25] life and
[53:26] all of those things are important to god
[53:28] but ultimately it's our spiritual
[53:31] condition that god is the most
[53:33] concerned with in so much that god will
[53:37] break your physical condition
[53:40] if it means it improves your spiritual
[53:42] condition
[53:44] i will say that again god will break
[53:46] your physical
[53:47] condition your health your money your
[53:50] social life whatever it is if god has to
[53:53] disrupt
[53:54] you're here tonight if god has to
[53:57] disrupt
[53:58] you physically to fix you
[54:02] spiritually
[54:07] then he's a heavenly father and as a
[54:09] heavenly father he'll do what he sees
[54:12] best for his children
[54:15] and you know it's often hard brother
[54:17] adam speaks of that no one likes
[54:19] spanking you take a small child and you
[54:22] see an
[54:22] error in that small child no no real
[54:25] mother
[54:26] likes to spank that child no real father
[54:29] likes to spank that child or
[54:31] enact discipline upon them but if you
[54:34] really love them brother branham says if
[54:36] you
[54:36] really love them even if it hurts
[54:39] you or hurts your feelings you'll
[54:42] correct
[54:43] the error of that child because why
[54:46] because their ultimate condition
[54:50] what they're going to be in life is more
[54:52] important to you
[54:54] as a mother as a father it's more
[54:56] important to you
[54:58] what they are becoming than what they
[55:00] are right now
[55:02] let me say that again i feel like some
[55:04] of you are just distracted so just pay
[55:06] attention here real close especially
[55:07] here at the beginning
[55:09] god cares more about where you're going
[55:12] to be
[55:13] than where you're at right now
[55:18] god puts more in what god is doing in
[55:20] your life
[55:21] maybe you don't understand what's
[55:23] happening or why certain
[55:25] pieces of your life are missing or why
[55:28] certain pieces seem out of joint
[55:30] or why things have been maybe mixed up a
[55:33] little bit but just remember
[55:34] god never really looks at the current
[55:37] condition but he looks at what you're
[55:39] going to be
[55:40] so god never gets discouraged by your
[55:43] failures right now
[55:44] god never gets discouraged by your by by
[55:48] how low you are
[55:49] right now so we shouldn't get
[55:51] discouraged
[55:52] by what our conditions look at right now
[55:54] don't ever get discouraged at what your
[55:56] life looks at right
[55:57] looks like right now what your
[55:58] children's life looks at like right now
[56:01] what your home looks like right now but
[56:03] say god i believe you're bringing me to
[56:05] something because you have a vision of
[56:08] me of what you want me to be
[56:10] and so whatever happens to me right now
[56:12] i'm going to believe it's because you're
[56:14] concerned and you're trying to bring me
[56:16] to something
[56:17] that you've envisioned for my life
[56:21] and so joel begins to prophesy to this
[56:24] he says their vines
[56:26] their their vines were flourishing were
[56:28] plentiful
[56:30] their vats were overflowing the fig
[56:32] trees
[56:33] the pomegranates were producing and the
[56:36] apples were producing and all the fruit
[56:39] trees were loaded down it was a
[56:41] it was a time of great spiritual high
[56:44] with our physical high
[56:46] naturally the land in israel was fertile
[56:49] it was producing it was green the barns
[56:52] were
[56:53] filled to the brim the olive oil was
[56:56] running over like a river and i'm not
[56:59] making this up this is right out of the
[57:00] bible
[57:01] and joel chapter 1 you can look at verse
[57:03] 10 let's look at that joel 1 verse 10.
[57:05] let's just look at some of these here
[57:06] for a moment
[57:08] joel chapter 1 brother chapstick we have
[57:10] that and let's just pull up verse 10
[57:12] and then we'll go to verse 17. and joel
[57:15] begins to speak about this and he says
[57:16] the field notice this here in verse 10 i
[57:18] want you to look at this
[57:20] and he says the the field is wasted the
[57:23] land mourneth for the corn is wasted
[57:25] the new wine is dried up the oil
[57:28] languisheth go to verse
[57:29] 17 if you could and he says he says the
[57:33] seed is
[57:33] rotten under their clods the garners are
[57:35] laid desolate the barns are broken down
[57:37] for the corn is withered next verse just
[57:39] go to the last one
[57:40] how did the beast he says how do the
[57:42] beasts groan
[57:43] the herds of cattle are perplexed
[57:45] because they have no pasture yea the
[57:47] flocks
[57:48] of sheep are made desolate so
[57:51] what does this prosperity bring it
[57:54] doesn't always bring
[57:56] the best spiritual condition
[58:00] sometimes the greatest prosperity brings
[58:02] the worst
[58:03] spirituality
[58:06] i said sometimes the greatest prosperity
[58:10] brings the greatest spiritual decay
[58:16] and sometimes the greatest poverty
[58:18] brings the greatest spiritual revival
[58:25] i want you to notice what moses warns
[58:26] them in deuteronomy chapter 6. this was
[58:28] amazing in verse 10
[58:31] and he's warned in israel and he says
[58:32] and it shall be when the lord thy god
[58:34] shall have brought thee into the land
[58:37] which he
[58:38] which he swore unto thy fathers to
[58:40] abraham to isaac
[58:42] and to jacob this is deuteronomy 6 10
[58:45] to give thee great and goodly cities
[58:47] which thou buildest not
[58:49] verse 11 and house is deuteronomy 6
[58:51] verse 11 and the house is full of
[58:53] all good things which thou fill us not
[58:57] and wells digged which thou digest not
[59:01] vineyards and olive trees which thou
[59:04] plant us not
[59:06] when thou shall have eaten and be full
[59:08] then
[59:10] he says then beware hold on paul's mute
[59:13] the screen for a second
[59:15] mute the screen just for a second so god
[59:18] says
[59:19] when you come into the land he says
[59:22] you're going to find
[59:24] that you have houses that are full of
[59:27] all good things when you come into the
[59:29] promised land
[59:30] he says your houses you're going to find
[59:32] they're going to be filled with all good
[59:34] things
[59:35] that you filled not in other words you
[59:38] didn't do this
[59:39] god did it look pull up verse 11 again
[59:41] brother travis i just want to reference
[59:42] it
[59:43] he says house is full of all good things
[59:45] which thou fill us not
[59:47] and wells digged which thou
[59:50] digest not in other words there was no
[59:53] labor
[59:54] involved there was no stress
[59:57] there was no sweat
[1:00:01] you know when you work for something you
[1:00:03] can appreciate it
[1:00:05] when you put your blood and your sweat
[1:00:07] and your tears into something and you
[1:00:09] give your effort
[1:00:11] then you can appreciate it and you know
[1:00:14] what it means to have
[1:00:15] because you've gained it you've done it
[1:00:17] you take he gives the example of the
[1:00:19] well
[1:00:20] and he says when you've dug a well that
[1:00:22] well will be precious to you if you
[1:00:24] if you're the one you know no drill back
[1:00:27] in those days no
[1:00:28] big well we had a well dug when our
[1:00:29] property guy pulled up with the truck
[1:00:31] and
[1:00:31] big thing big uh tower raised up and
[1:00:34] by the end of the day he had dug 185
[1:00:37] feet could you imagine what it was in
[1:00:41] those days when there was no machinery
[1:00:43] to dig that well
[1:00:45] could you imagine and you're digging it
[1:00:46] by the sweat of your brow
[1:00:48] and the the your own back breaking under
[1:00:52] the load
[1:00:53] of the however long months or if you're
[1:00:56] just one or two people
[1:00:57] months of work but you know what it
[1:00:59] meant when you've worked for something
[1:01:01] when you've labored over something
[1:01:03] then it brings on such a you you value
[1:01:06] it you
[1:01:07] you will protect it you will defend it
[1:01:09] you it means something to you
[1:01:14] i'm not saying you all have to go out
[1:01:15] and dig your own wells
[1:01:17] but i guarantee if you've paid that guy
[1:01:19] three thousand dollars to dig your well
[1:01:23] that will mean something to you
[1:01:26] if you've worked for something if you've
[1:01:27] worked hard at something
[1:01:29] and you you've you you you've gained
[1:01:31] notice what he says wells
[1:01:33] verse 11 which thou dig it's not
[1:01:35] vineyards and olive trees
[1:01:37] which you plant us not when thou shall
[1:01:40] have eaten
[1:01:41] and be full so what is what is the
[1:01:45] warning from god
[1:01:46] when god gives you a blessing a
[1:01:48] spiritual blessing and what is the holy
[1:01:50] spirit
[1:01:51] the holy spirit is a spiritual blessing
[1:01:54] it's a free it's free grace that god has
[1:01:56] given you it's a spiritual bounty
[1:01:58] or a spiritual increase and god has just
[1:02:00] given it to you
[1:02:02] out of his own goodness out of his own
[1:02:04] because he's a good
[1:02:05] kind heavenly father he gives you good
[1:02:07] things
[1:02:08] he fills your house with good things
[1:02:12] and so moses then warns them and says
[1:02:14] but because
[1:02:16] that you did nothing to receive those
[1:02:18] spiritual blessings verse 12
[1:02:20] then beware
[1:02:24] lest thou forget the lord
[1:02:28] which brought thee out of the land of
[1:02:30] egypt from the house of bondage
[1:02:34] because when you're given something you
[1:02:36] don't
[1:02:37] value it the same as if you had worked
[1:02:40] for something
[1:02:41] that's just the nature of all of us here
[1:02:43] tonight
[1:02:46] you forget it you forget about it and he
[1:02:48] says i'm warning you
[1:02:50] when you get over there god's gonna
[1:02:51] bless you he's gonna fill your houses
[1:02:53] he's gonna
[1:02:54] give you vineyards that you didn't plant
[1:02:56] but don't forget the lord
[1:02:58] don't forget god who brought you up out
[1:03:00] of egypt don't forget the spiritual
[1:03:03] benefits that you enjoy you did nothing
[1:03:06] to deserve
[1:03:07] it
[1:03:10] he says you did nothing to deserve and
[1:03:12] this is exactly
[1:03:14] what happens this is exactly what
[1:03:17] happens to
[1:03:18] israel out of all of this prosperity out
[1:03:21] of all of this
[1:03:22] increase out of all this great physical
[1:03:25] uh uh uh fatness that they that they
[1:03:29] enjoyed the land being fertile
[1:03:31] and out of this great wealth they had
[1:03:34] begin to
[1:03:34] forget the lord and so what does god do
[1:03:39] the bible records that god sends them a
[1:03:42] plague why does god send a plague
[1:03:46] is it to punish them you know it's so
[1:03:49] important how we look at these things
[1:03:52] because if you look at it as punishment
[1:03:55] then you look at god as being cruel
[1:03:57] and god's not cruel why does he send the
[1:04:01] plague of locusts
[1:04:02] does he do it out of revenge
[1:04:06] you did me wrong so i'm going to do you
[1:04:07] wrong no it wasn't that about that at
[1:04:09] all
[1:04:10] why does god send the the plague of
[1:04:13] locusts
[1:04:14] uh is it is it because god is cruel or
[1:04:17] he's devised something to
[1:04:19] make them suffer just in some maniacal
[1:04:22] way that he just that's what that's what
[1:04:24] the secular world would have you believe
[1:04:27] but god does this because he's trying to
[1:04:30] fix their spiritual condition
[1:04:34] and anytime god has to bring something
[1:04:36] to your life it's for a good purpose and
[1:04:39] a good reason
[1:04:40] because as the song says he's a good
[1:04:42] good father
[1:04:43] that's who he is he's not a bad father
[1:04:45] he's a good father
[1:04:46] he's a heavenly father and so anything
[1:04:48] god brings about in your life no matter
[1:04:51] what you
[1:04:51] physically have to suffer god says it's
[1:04:54] for your own
[1:04:55] spiritual benefit and at the end of the
[1:04:59] day it's only spiritual things that
[1:05:00] lasts
[1:05:03] amen so god sends them
[1:05:07] this plague of locusts and chapter two
[1:05:10] is all about this repeated plague i want
[1:05:12] to show you if you have that video
[1:05:13] brother travis you could display it
[1:05:15] here for a moment i want you to see this
[1:05:17] just for a second what
[1:05:18] and we may not play the whole thing it
[1:05:20] should be in the email if you have it
[1:05:21] good if you don't i'll skip it i was
[1:05:23] tossed whether to play because it's
[1:05:24] about two minutes long okay good
[1:05:26] you can play that and then just turn the
[1:05:27] volume up nice and loud if you could
[1:05:29] just for a moment
[1:05:30] yep go ahead try that i think that's the
[1:05:32] right one yeah
[1:05:33] yeah yeah yeah press play and then to
[1:05:36] just turn the volume make sure the
[1:05:38] volume is nice and loud on the computer
[1:05:39] gotta unmute the computer channel
[1:05:42] actually it's not going to i've got it
[1:05:43] set up don't worry about that i want the
[1:05:45] volume's not important i want you to
[1:05:46] look this is madagascar
[1:05:49] they're suffering a plague the worst
[1:05:51] plague in 60 years
[1:05:54] of locusts because when you read that in
[1:05:57] the bible and you think a plague of
[1:05:58] locusts you know what does that really
[1:05:59] mean well this is sort of what it looks
[1:06:00] like
[1:06:02] and you know what does locusts do the
[1:06:03] the the man is saying that all of their
[1:06:05] crops all of the effort everything that
[1:06:07] they had put in for that year
[1:06:09] had been destroyed because those locusts
[1:06:11] go through and they eat
[1:06:12] everything they don't just eat the the
[1:06:16] the corn they eat the stalk they eat the
[1:06:19] tassel they eat the
[1:06:20] everything they they eat it down to
[1:06:22] nothing to where
[1:06:23] everything is completely destroyed and
[1:06:26] it's and it's out of control
[1:06:29] it completely takes over this is what
[1:06:32] god
[1:06:33] warns them of and and he gives them a
[1:06:36] natural

[1:07:13] we look at man trying to act like beasts
[1:07:15] and look like beasts and the women
[1:07:17] trying to look like animals
[1:07:19] with the paints on their face knowing
[1:07:21] that these things are predicted to
[1:07:23] happen
[1:07:25] that the thing will they'll go so insane
[1:07:28] to locust will raise up that's
[1:07:30] revelations 9
[1:07:32] with hair like women to haunt the women
[1:07:36] and teeth like lions and things that he
[1:07:38] says that you've said
[1:07:40] the mental condition of the people will
[1:07:42] be completely
[1:07:44] gone and he says
[1:07:47] we see it in the making right
[1:07:51] now we see it
[1:07:54] in the making right now
[1:07:59] the world going completely insane it's
[1:08:02] just a preview of what's coming
[1:08:05] it's just a preview you think plague
[1:08:08] they call covet to plague
[1:08:10] go read revelations 9 you'll read what a
[1:08:11] plague is
[1:08:13] what a real plague is it's just a little
[1:08:16] hiccup a baby a a little a little
[1:08:19] in miniature something so small that has
[1:08:22] wrecked the entire world and the bible
[1:08:24] says that there's things coming upon the
[1:08:26] earth
[1:08:27] to where men's hearts would have would
[1:08:29] have a heart attack heart failure over
[1:08:31] fear of those things coming upon the
[1:08:35] earth
[1:08:37] i say like god's prophet said lord don't

[1:08:43] you say lord let me go with you
[1:08:45] father don't let me be here to
[1:08:47] experience those tribulations
[1:08:49] don't let me be here and experience that
[1:08:51] purge so purge me now lord purge me of
[1:08:54] anything unlike you
[1:08:55] let me go through the purge right now by
[1:08:58] the by the let the holy spirit be a
[1:09:00] teacher to me
[1:09:04] he says he says uh this is this is just
[1:09:08] a message here and god begins to say
[1:09:10] this in joel
[1:09:11] chapter 12 chapter 2 verse 12.
[1:09:14] he says therefore also now saith the
[1:09:17] lord
[1:09:18] turn you even to me with all your heart
[1:09:21] joel 2
[1:09:23] joel chapter 2 verse 12. therefore i
[1:09:26] also now say the lord
[1:09:27] turn you even to me with all your heart
[1:09:30] and with fasting
[1:09:31] and with weeping and with mourning and
[1:09:34] rind
[1:09:35] your heart not your garments
[1:09:38] do you have that joel too he says go
[1:09:40] back to verse 12.
[1:09:41] therefore also now say the lord turn you
[1:09:44] even to me
[1:09:45] with all your heart
[1:09:49] have you have you done that i asked
[1:09:52] myself that question i've read this
[1:09:53] i read this and said lord have i turned
[1:09:56] to you
[1:09:57] with all my heart amen
[1:10:01] because so often we we turn some of us
[1:10:04] some part of us some aspect or some
[1:10:07] area but i say lord let me make sure
[1:10:10] that if i'm repenting if i'm turning
[1:10:12] around
[1:10:12] i turn to you with all my heart lord
[1:10:16] do you feel that way here tonight and
[1:10:17] say lord i want to turn to you with
[1:10:19] all that's within me he says say the
[1:10:22] lord turn you into me with all your
[1:10:24] heart
[1:10:26] and with fasting and with weeping you
[1:10:28] think that fasting doesn't mean anything
[1:10:30] to god
[1:10:31] i guarantee you it does you think
[1:10:34] weeping doesn't mean anything to god if
[1:10:35] you're not careful the devil will try to
[1:10:38] so microsize that and minimize that's
[1:10:40] not so important it's just important
[1:10:42] that you pray
[1:10:43] god says i see your mourning i see your
[1:10:45] weeping
[1:10:46] you want to get a hold of the holy
[1:10:47] spirit for your family for your job for
[1:10:50] your health for your children for your
[1:10:52] church
[1:10:52] god says then turn to me with all your
[1:10:54] heart i'll see your mourning i'll see
[1:10:57] your fasting i'll see your weeping
[1:11:02] he says in verse 13. he says and rend
[1:11:06] rip tear don't tear your clothes
[1:11:11] you see this is what israel the the the
[1:11:13] the priests would do they'd rip their
[1:11:14] garments
[1:11:15] and take ashes and sackcloth and and
[1:11:18] they'd go for
[1:11:19] i forget how many days it was they'd
[1:11:21] wear sackcloth
[1:11:23] and this this uncomfortable sackcloth is
[1:11:25] what it was this burlap that was
[1:11:27] we've taught on that hair before the
[1:11:29] burlap that was so uncomfortable and
[1:11:31] itchy
[1:11:32] and itch them to death you just
[1:11:35] you put that sackcloth on and then
[1:11:37] they'd take them
[1:11:38] as that as if that wasn't bad enough
[1:11:40] they'd take ashes and then just pour
[1:11:42] ashes and smear ashes all over
[1:11:44] themselves
[1:11:45] and they'd go through the city you know
[1:11:46] what they were doing repenting
[1:11:52] you know what they were doing they were
[1:11:54] trying to make amends with god
[1:11:57] and how many times do we do that and and
[1:11:59] and we come to god with
[1:12:01] ashes and sackcloth and oh god i'm so
[1:12:04] sorry no
[1:12:05] lord would you god says don't don't
[1:12:07] don't come to me with just outward
[1:12:09] external
[1:12:10] emotions don't don't come with me just
[1:12:12] outward external
[1:12:14] tears but rend your heart
[1:12:17] not your garments surrender your heart
[1:12:19] let it be a what we need here tonight
[1:12:22] is less external uh turning and
[1:12:24] attrition to god
[1:12:25] and more internal where a heart can turn
[1:12:28] to god and say lord
[1:12:29] i'm doing this because there's something
[1:12:31] inside of me i'm sick of myself i'm sick
[1:12:34] of my ways i'm sick of myself going in
[1:12:36] the same direction for years
[1:12:38] and i want to turn my entire heart to
[1:12:40] you lord.
[1:12:43] he says turn your hearts turn into the
[1:12:46] lord your god for his gracious i'm so
[1:12:48] glad for that
[1:12:49] he's merciful slow to anger
[1:12:53] and of great kindness
[1:12:56] and repenteth him of the evil
[1:12:59] who knoweth if he will return and repent
[1:13:01] notice this and leave a blessing behind
[1:13:04] him even a meat offering in the drink
[1:13:06] over it lord your god blow the trumpet
[1:13:08] in zion
[1:13:08] sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly
[1:13:12] gather the people gather the people
[1:13:17] sanctify the congregation you think
[1:13:20] gathering's not important to god it was
[1:13:22] all the way throughout the entire bible
[1:13:25] gather the people sanctify the
[1:13:28] congregation assemble the elders gather
[1:13:30] the children those that suck the breast
[1:13:31] let the bridegroom go forth
[1:13:33] of his out of his chamber and the bride
[1:13:35] out of her closet
[1:13:37] let the priests the ministers of the
[1:13:39] lord
[1:13:40] weep between the porch and the altar let
[1:13:43] them say
[1:13:44] spare thy people o lord and
[1:13:47] give not thine heritage to reproach that
[1:13:50] the heathen should rule over them
[1:13:52] wherefore should they say among the
[1:13:54] people where is there
[1:13:55] god this is god trying to sow his word
[1:13:58] into their hearts he's
[1:14:00] given his desire i want you to repent i
[1:14:02] want you to have a good a heart that's
[1:14:05] irrendering before me he says let him
[1:14:07] let him call isabel a solemn assembly
[1:14:09] let the priest the minister of the lord
[1:14:10] weep between the porch and the altar
[1:14:13] you know what the reaction to joel's
[1:14:15] first call to repentance was
[1:14:17] that most people you know you know what
[1:14:19] you know what the bible records
[1:14:21] that after these words from the prophet
[1:14:23] of joel telling them to repent and to
[1:14:26] turn
[1:14:26] to repent and to turn and repent and
[1:14:29] turn you know what they did they went
[1:14:30] out and got drunk
[1:14:35] yeah they went out and they got drunk
[1:14:38] most of them
[1:14:39] most of them just drunk themselves into
[1:14:41] a stupor
[1:14:43] people have two different reactions to
[1:14:46] warning to judgment
[1:14:48] when judgment is warned upon someone's
[1:14:50] life they'll either bury themselves
[1:14:52] deeper
[1:14:53] to mute out that sound of conviction
[1:14:57] some people repent some people
[1:15:01] turn some people rin their hearts others
[1:15:04] get drunk
[1:15:07] man i thought you ought to be shouting
[1:15:09] and doing jericho marches when i said
[1:15:10] that
[1:15:14] it's true certain people you get to such
[1:15:17] a place to where
[1:15:18] darkness is so around you and the bible
[1:15:20] says they love darkness
[1:15:22] more than light when the light was
[1:15:24] shined the darkness comprehended not
[1:15:26] they loved their darkness
[1:15:28] more than their light and rather than
[1:15:30] hearing the words of warning whether you
[1:15:32] know i'm so afraid sometimes the word of
[1:15:34] god
[1:15:34] can just callous people's hearts
[1:15:36] sometimes and you do that of your own
[1:15:39] free moral agency and your own choice
[1:15:42] because you won't respond to the word of
[1:15:44] god when god's trying through sermons
[1:15:46] and through difficulties and through
[1:15:48] locusts in your life eating things away
[1:15:50] and rather than turning with your whole
[1:15:52] heart and repenting
[1:15:54] you just intoxicate yourself with more
[1:15:57] and you go deeper and you go further and
[1:15:59] further
[1:16:00] he said brother matt does that really
[1:16:01] happen that happens all the time
[1:16:05] and he promises them and he says if they
[1:16:07] do god says
[1:16:08] if you just rend your heart then i'll
[1:16:11] restore the years
[1:16:13] that the locusts have eaten he promises
[1:16:16] if there's total repentance
[1:16:18] then here's what you'll get total
[1:16:20] restoration
[1:16:22] when there's total repentance there's
[1:16:24] total restoration
[1:16:26] when god sees a total heart that totally
[1:16:28] turns for him god says
[1:16:29] we can forget about all those judgments
[1:16:31] and all those things in the past
[1:16:33] i'll reverse the curse from your life
[1:16:36] and i'll restore to you
[1:16:37] all the years you've wasted i'll restore
[1:16:39] to you all the love that was lost
[1:16:41] all the years that you toiled going the
[1:16:43] wrong direction
[1:16:44] i'll cancel it all
[1:16:49] god says i'm going to clear the debt you
[1:16:52] know what repentance does
[1:16:53] i'm just going to preach very nuts and
[1:16:55] bolts here so just listen to me
[1:16:57] you know what how powerful repentance is
[1:17:02] you know powerful repentances
[1:17:06] when a person really repents
[1:17:09] there's true repentance is there
[1:17:12] something
[1:17:12] that there's false repentance but when
[1:17:16] there's
[1:17:16] true repentance and in order to get to
[1:17:20] true repentance you've got to
[1:17:21] really humble yourself
[1:17:26] you've got to completely humble your
[1:17:28] spirit
[1:17:29] humble your attitude don't hold on to it
[1:17:33] at all
[1:17:35] the mental struggles sometimes when god
[1:17:37] comes and begins to deal with the
[1:17:38] person's heart
[1:17:40] and begins to through his own way
[1:17:43] and only the holy spirit can do that a
[1:17:45] friend can't do it
[1:17:46] a mother or father they can they can try
[1:17:48] and admonish you
[1:17:49] and and it's good to have admonishment
[1:17:52] from friends and family
[1:17:54] but you know the holy spirit can do a an
[1:17:56] inward work that man can't do
[1:18:00] and when god begins to deal with your
[1:18:02] heart and the holy spirit begins to
[1:18:04] work and move upon your spirit
[1:18:07] immediately
[1:18:08] you you realize how fast just underneath
[1:18:11] the surface is
[1:18:12] pride and there's self-justification you
[1:18:15] begin to justify yourself and justify
[1:18:17] this and
[1:18:18] in your own mind and then the
[1:18:20] comparative start and you compare
[1:18:22] yourself to this person i'm not as bad
[1:18:23] as that guy and i'm not as bad as
[1:18:25] at least i'm not over here doing this at
[1:18:27] least i'm not over here doing this you
[1:18:28] know brother branham says
[1:18:29] he says just take your pride and throw
[1:18:32] it on the ground and stomp it under your
[1:18:34] feet
[1:18:36] then god can god can speak to you
[1:18:39] but until you do that and two there has
[1:18:42] to be recognition
[1:18:43] that say i'm wrong i admit that i'm
[1:18:46] wrong and i'm throwing all my pride down
[1:18:48] i'm not justifying anything
[1:18:49] i'm wrong i'm truly repented and god
[1:18:51] says when there's total
[1:18:53] repentance there's total restoration
[1:18:57] can you say amen here when there's total
[1:19:00] repentance
[1:19:01] there's total restoration there's
[1:19:04] complete
[1:19:05] restoration and it's prophesied it's
[1:19:08] promised
[1:19:09] the bible we the bible says there's a
[1:19:11] great time
[1:19:12] of restoration and and and and the the
[1:19:16] the scripture says
[1:19:17] joel says in joel chapter 2 verse 1 he
[1:19:20] says the day of the lord cometh for it
[1:19:22] is nigh at hands
[1:19:23] the the heavens the the heavens will
[1:19:26] quake the
[1:19:27] earth will tremble him not only you know
[1:19:29] the scripture it says do not only shake
[1:19:32] uh earth or heaven but it will also
[1:19:34] shake the earth
[1:19:36] and he says it's time this is why it
[1:19:38] says blow the trumpets and sound the
[1:19:40] alarm
[1:19:40] get right with the holy spirit
[1:19:44] and he promises and he says he says
[1:19:47] here's what i
[1:19:48] see this is what i see in joe 2 verse 24
[1:19:51] we read it we want to read it again
[1:19:53] he sees floors full
[1:19:56] of wheat he says flour is full of wheat
[1:20:01] and the vats overflowing with wine
[1:20:04] and oil now joe is seeing
[1:20:09] not years not canker with the cankerworm
[1:20:11] and the caterpillar and all of the decay
[1:20:13] and all the rot
[1:20:15] you see what joel is beginning to do
[1:20:16] he's beginning to prophesy of what's
[1:20:18] coming he's beginning to prophesy of not
[1:20:21] what's here now but what could be
[1:20:25] god says this is what could be this is
[1:20:27] what i see this is what i desire
[1:20:30] this is what i want floors full of wheat
[1:20:34] and he says vats overflowing verse 24
[1:20:38] with wine and oil what is it a prophet
[1:20:41] only a prophet can do this
[1:20:43] because a prophet doesn't look at what's
[1:20:45] right now he sees what's coming
[1:20:47] and he says don't look at the condition
[1:20:49] right now but there's a restoration
[1:20:51] promised there's a restoration coming
[1:20:53] because god is not a god of decay and
[1:20:55] corruption and breaking down he's a god
[1:20:57] of
[1:20:58] building up he's a god of restoring the
[1:21:00] years and restoring what's lost and
[1:21:02] giving back what satan's taken from you
[1:21:06] and god says i'm prophesying through
[1:21:07] joel a year of restoration
[1:21:10] and he says where i'll restore all the
[1:21:13] famished people
[1:21:15] will once again eat in plenty he says in
[1:21:18] verse 26
[1:21:19] eating in plenty and fully satisfied
[1:21:23] hallelujah you showed him plenty be
[1:21:26] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:21:27] lord your god
[1:21:28] that hath dealt wondrously with you and
[1:21:29] my people shall never
[1:21:31] be ashamed
[1:21:35] the shame the the
[1:21:38] the shame will lift god's people will
[1:21:40] eat in plenty he says and be fully
[1:21:43] satisfied you know what god is doing god
[1:21:47] through the prophet is beginning to
[1:21:48] prophesy
[1:21:49] and he's reminding us saying that that
[1:21:51] the lord's going to do this
[1:21:53] this is going to be the lord's doing
[1:21:55] he's going to execute his plan
[1:21:58] he's going to he's going to execute a
[1:22:00] promise
[1:22:01] and he says in verse 25 and i will
[1:22:04] restore to you
[1:22:06] the years that the locusts hath eaten
[1:22:10] the cankerworm the caterpillar the
[1:22:13] palmer worm
[1:22:14] my great army which i sent among you
[1:22:17] you know david david begins to to to say
[1:22:20] this about the righteous
[1:22:22] and he says in psalms of verse chapter 1
[1:22:25] verse 1 he says the righteous shall be
[1:22:28] like a tree
[1:22:30] planted by the rivers of water
[1:22:34] that bringeth forth fruit
[1:22:37] with leaves that don't wither
[1:22:42] this is what the righteous shall be the
[1:22:44] righteous god's family god's elected
[1:22:47] shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:22:50] rivers of water
[1:22:52] that bringeth forth fruit in the season
[1:22:54] his leaf
[1:22:55] also shall not wither and whatsoever
[1:22:58] he doeth shall prosper
[1:23:03] you know what that is that's in the
[1:23:04] midst of a wicked age
[1:23:06] in the midst of a world that's falling
[1:23:08] apart in the middle of satan's eden
[1:23:11] in the middle of total insanity the
[1:23:13] righteous shall be
[1:23:15] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:23:17] water who has fruit when the rest of the
[1:23:19] world is barren
[1:23:20] who's producing when the rest of the
[1:23:22] world is going and groping in darkness
[1:23:24] the righteous shall be like a tree
[1:23:26] planted by the rivers of water
[1:23:28] this is what god has prophesied of this
[1:23:31] church of your life of your family of
[1:23:33] your home
[1:23:34] i say god i accept it i believe it i
[1:23:37] claim it i'm making a steak on your
[1:23:40] promise for my home
[1:23:41] it won't be a home that's withering it
[1:23:43] won't be a fruit
[1:23:44] that's barren but it'll be a fruit
[1:23:46] overflowing wine filling the
[1:23:48] weed filling the floors my vats will be
[1:23:50] overflowing

[1:23:55] restoration and he says that promise is
[1:23:58] to
[1:23:58] to not to the sinner but to the
[1:24:00] righteous not to those who love their
[1:24:02] sins but those
[1:24:03] who are repentant of their sins
[1:24:06] who've given their whole life over to
[1:24:08] god david says the ungodly are not so
[1:24:12] they become weak they become withered
[1:24:16] blown about by every wind and wave of
[1:24:19] dark
[1:24:20] of doctrine compromised
[1:24:24] christians compromised believers
[1:24:28] are like likened unto withered
[1:24:32] trees diseased and corrupted with every

[1:25:22] god

[1:25:25] some memory
[1:25:26] or some bitterness or some jealousy
[1:25:31] you know what saint's trying to do to
[1:25:32] make you jealous he's trying to clog up
[1:25:34] those channels
[1:25:36] when when satan puts something in your
[1:25:38] life he wants to take that trial that
[1:25:40] god
[1:25:40] meant to perfect you and to bring you
[1:25:42] character and he wants to begin to eat
[1:25:44] away at your mind to cause that trial to
[1:25:46] make you
[1:25:47] bitter
[1:25:50] hello to make you bitter to make you
[1:25:54] disease to make you corrupted
[1:25:57] to corrupt you to take away your
[1:26:00] time of you know you know you know what
[1:26:02] brings spiritual
[1:26:04] health to your tree so that it won't
[1:26:06] wither this
[1:26:11] you see i got to get some sunlight on
[1:26:13] this seed
[1:26:15] open the book open the book i got
[1:26:19] i got to water that seed uh open the
[1:26:21] book
[1:26:22] and then water begins to flow when the
[1:26:24] word of god begins to be read
[1:26:26] god you you you take that time away with
[1:26:30] from the rest of the world and shut away
[1:26:31] with god
[1:26:32] listen to god's word have it plain in
[1:26:34] your ear reading the bible every day
[1:26:37] you know what it's doing it's bringing
[1:26:38] sun and light
[1:26:40] and atmosphere to cause that seed to
[1:26:42] grow
[1:26:46] so satan will do anything you can to
[1:26:48] keep that he'll belittle that and
[1:26:49] devalue that in your life
[1:26:51] devalue the word of god devalue the
[1:26:54] message of the hour to value the
[1:26:56] the the spirit of god in the presence of
[1:26:58] the lord in your life
[1:27:00] because he knows that that out that when
[1:27:02] the when the sun is shining
[1:27:03] and the plant is healthy there's no
[1:27:05] cankerworms there's no caterpillars
[1:27:07] there's no palmer worms
[1:27:08] there's no there's no fear of doubt and
[1:27:11] anxiety and stress and worry
[1:27:18] joel says in verse 12 of chapter 1
[1:27:21] he says all the trees of the field are
[1:27:23] withered
[1:27:25] joel 1 verse 12 for all the trees of the
[1:27:27] filter withered
[1:27:29] for their joy has dried up
[1:27:34] for their joy notice this the vine is
[1:27:37] dry the fig tree languishes
[1:27:39] if you could go to yeah verse 12 perfect
[1:27:43] uh he says the pomegranate tree the palm
[1:27:45] tree also the apple tree even all the
[1:27:46] truth of the filter withered because joy
[1:27:48] is withered away from the sons of men
[1:27:53] when satan can rob you of your joy
[1:27:56] and man there's a lot of joy thiefs
[1:28:01] in this life there's a lot of joy thiefs
[1:28:06] satan will bring any kind of thing in
[1:28:08] your life to rob you of your joy
[1:28:11] to take away your smile to take away
[1:28:14] your happiness
[1:28:16] he'll plant any kind of palmer worm or
[1:28:18] canker worm that begins to eat that away
[1:28:21] even if he has to completely delude your
[1:28:23] mind and you look at things differently
[1:28:25] and life is just so
[1:28:26] drab it'll get you to such a condition
[1:28:28] to where all you see is the negative
[1:28:31] you know there's a lot of negative in
[1:28:33] your life i'm sure it's right now you're
[1:28:35] facing
[1:28:35] negative but don't ever let the devil
[1:28:38] allow you to focus on only the negative
[1:28:40] because you focus only on the negative
[1:28:42] you become a negative person
[1:28:46] and a negative person doesn't produce
[1:28:48] fruit
[1:28:49] doesn't produce happiness doesn't
[1:28:51] produce zeal and passion for the lord
[1:28:53] but negativity always
[1:28:56] and it's amazing satan will always get
[1:28:58] you in a negative condition and then
[1:28:59] he'll put you around somebody else in
[1:29:01] that same
[1:29:01] negative condition and negatives attract
[1:29:04] negatives
[1:29:07] negatives attract negatives you ever
[1:29:11] notice that critical people are
[1:29:12] attracted to other critical people
[1:29:16] you think that's an accident that's a
[1:29:17] spirit
[1:29:19] hello somebody that's a spirit that
[1:29:23] comes upon people and in the tracks
[1:29:25] birds of a feather flock together
[1:29:27] and that same cancerous canker worm will
[1:29:29] begin to eat away and eat away in it
[1:29:32] before you know it it's spread
[1:29:33] through the whole church
[1:29:40] where was i
[1:29:44] he'd do anything to rob you of your joy
[1:29:46] and do anything to rob the church of its
[1:29:48] joy
[1:29:49] to take away the joy of the lord because
[1:29:51] the bible says the joy is your strength
[1:29:53] the joy of the lord is your strength and
[1:29:55] listen to me friends you need
[1:29:56] strength today you need strength today
[1:29:59] you don't need to add to your list of
[1:30:01] negatives there's enough in this world
[1:30:04] you need to add to your positives if the
[1:30:07] news is making you negative
[1:30:09] stop reading the news and then if that
[1:30:12] podcast is making you negative stop
[1:30:14] listening to it cut it out of your life
[1:30:17] we need everything we can to enrich our
[1:30:19] spiritual lives
[1:30:20] not to destroy it you need every moment
[1:30:23] of fellowship
[1:30:24] to enrich that strength because because
[1:30:26] there's strength in numbers did you know
[1:30:28] that
[1:30:30] there's strength in numbers
[1:30:34] if there's strength in numbers then
[1:30:35] there must be weakness and solitude and
[1:30:37] isolation
[1:30:40] amen this is a wednesday night i can get
[1:30:42] as practical as we
[1:30:44] we need to be there's there's there's i
[1:30:46] i know some
[1:30:47] covet has brought forced isolation upon
[1:30:50] a lot of people
[1:30:51] let me just say this don't be any more
[1:30:52] isolated than you need to be
[1:30:55] don't be any more not isolated than you
[1:30:57] have to be
[1:30:59] because if there's joy there's strength
[1:31:00] in numbers and there is when the family
[1:31:02] of god gets together
[1:31:04] when the body of christ brings all their
[1:31:06] licks of fire
[1:31:07] into the house of god something begins
[1:31:09] to happen a spirit of revival
[1:31:11] starts to fall upon the adults and upon
[1:31:13] the young people upon the ministry and
[1:31:16] before you know it satan's defeated
[1:31:18] and the voice of god speaking to his
[1:31:20] people and there's joy and shouting in
[1:31:22] the camp
[1:31:23] and god can do something in that kind of
[1:31:25] atmosphere i say we need to get behind
[1:31:28] each of us need to get behind the spirit
[1:31:30] of god
[1:31:31] trying to do something in this church
[1:31:32] and say bring it on lord i want to be a
[1:31:34] supporter of it i don't want to be a
[1:31:36] detractor
[1:31:37] i don't want to be a hindrance lord let
[1:31:39] my life support what you're trying to do
[1:31:42] do you feel that way church do you feel
[1:31:44] that way say lord
[1:31:45] you're trying to move let me be in the
[1:31:48] don't let me be in the way
[1:31:49] don't let me get in your way don't let
[1:31:51] me be a hindrance let me give my voice
[1:31:53] of support
[1:31:54] let me give my my participation and
[1:31:56] support
[1:32:03] notice what he says here he says he hath
[1:32:05] verse 6 he hath the teeth
[1:32:08] let me make sure it's where i want to go
[1:32:10] to
[1:32:12] he hath the teeth of a great lion joel
[1:32:14] one verse six he hath laid at my vine
[1:32:16] waste and barked my fig tree
[1:32:18] you know what that means it means he's
[1:32:19] chewed it off
[1:32:21] he's chewed it off verse seven
[1:32:24] he says he hath laid my waist barked my
[1:32:27] fig tree it made it clean
[1:32:28] bear and cast it away the branches
[1:32:32] thereof
[1:32:34] are made white imagine
[1:32:38] remember brother branham goes to that
[1:32:40] forest there
[1:32:41] forget what forest it was and he said
[1:32:43] all the trees were just
[1:32:45] bleached white you remember that
[1:32:49] and he says and he says and i just seen
[1:32:51] he said they and i forget
[1:32:52] forgive me if i get the story i'm just
[1:32:54] calling it by remember i think there was
[1:32:56] some
[1:32:56] if i remember right some kind of bomb
[1:32:59] that it went off or some kind of
[1:33:00] radiation maybe or something had
[1:33:01] happened
[1:33:02] and he says he went through that force
[1:33:04] and said all the trees were
[1:33:06] he says they were they were white and
[1:33:08] all the bark
[1:33:09] had came off and remember he says there
[1:33:12] was that when the wind would come
[1:33:13] through he said to make that
[1:33:15] creepy just that eerie how
[1:33:19] the prophet of god begins to say he says
[1:33:21] that it's like the church
[1:33:22] he says satan's ate away the bark so
[1:33:24] much dried them up
[1:33:27] just dried them up gave them so much
[1:33:28] religion
[1:33:30] you know just enough religion can make
[1:33:33] you
[1:33:33] miserable that's that lukewarm condition
[1:33:37] that
[1:33:37] revelations 3 speaks of can make you
[1:33:39] miserable
[1:33:42] he says that howling through there he
[1:33:44] says oh just that
[1:33:45] little howling wind that came through
[1:33:47] the trees
[1:33:48] and he says but then i s i i picked up i
[1:33:50] tipped over a little rock
[1:33:53] i think it was a rock and he says i
[1:33:54] tipped over that little rock and he says
[1:33:57] and there was a little green sprout
[1:33:59] he said a little green leaf a little
[1:34:01] green sprout that had sprouted up think
[1:34:03] of it
[1:34:04] in the midst of all that white bleached
[1:34:06] and all of that death and
[1:34:08] all of that howling god had protected
[1:34:10] that one
[1:34:12] little plant god has preserved its life
[1:34:16] and notice what he begins to say i will

[1:34:32] of joy lost
[1:34:33] i'm going to give you years of joy

[1:39:30] outwardly appears as trees that are
[1:39:33] planted by living water but
[1:39:34] inwardly they're waterlogged ever seen a
[1:39:38] water oak before we had two of them go
[1:39:39] to go down in our backyard
[1:39:41] hurricane matthew my name's sake

[1:39:51] them
[1:39:52] never knew i i know i know i thought i
[1:39:54] knew what a you know a good healthy oak
[1:39:56] tree looked like
[1:39:56] from the outside completely healthy just
[1:39:59] looked
[1:40:00] green leaves and everything on the
[1:40:02] outside just looked great
[1:40:04] you know what you know the only thing
[1:40:06] that changed that the wind
[1:40:08] yeah the only thing that changed the
[1:40:11] condition
[1:40:11] changed my outlook on those trees
[1:40:14] calamity
[1:40:16] and calamity revealed the real condition
[1:40:19] of those trees
[1:40:22] and calamity peace and prosperity never

[1:40:35] are you like a tree planted by the
[1:40:36] rivers of water that water oak looked
[1:40:39] perfectly healthy
[1:40:40] 80 70 plus feet tall two of them

[1:40:45] none of my oak trees none of my
[1:40:46] magnolias none of my pines nothing went
[1:40:48] down
[1:40:49] but those two water oaks with just a
[1:40:50] little bit of wind one of them started
[1:40:52] coming down
[1:40:53] others started coming down hit the other
[1:40:55] one hit a magnolia tree and
[1:40:57] we came home to a mess
[1:41:00] got up behind that tree couldn't believe
[1:41:02] it i thought what in the world what's
[1:41:03] wrong with these trees
[1:41:04] realize walk to the back side to where
[1:41:06] the root ball was like this
[1:41:08] tree's coming like this walked to the
[1:41:10] back side and i could see about
[1:41:12] about probably 15 feet up that tree
[1:41:14] hollow
[1:41:16] completely rotten on the inside on the
[1:41:19] outside looked healthy
[1:41:21] oh they also looked everything was fine
[1:41:23] everything was good man life looked good
[1:41:25] tree's gonna live forever
[1:41:29] you know the bible says that the fire
[1:41:31] will try
[1:41:32] men's works that there's come in a
[1:41:36] purifying fire and it will try every
[1:41:39] man's work
[1:41:41] those that have built their house on hay
[1:41:43] and on stubble and
[1:41:44] on sand
[1:41:48] it tried them and it didn't stand the
[1:41:50] test
[1:41:51] the wind the the the the calamity came
[1:41:55] and they couldn't stand they both fell
[1:41:57] and came to the ground
[1:41:59] completely rotten on the inside but
[1:42:01] outside looked perfectly fine
[1:42:04] that's why joe joel is saying don't god
[1:42:06] says don't render
[1:42:08] the outward clothes but rend your heart
[1:42:11] make sure you've made your call in an
[1:42:13] election shore
[1:42:16] canker worms caterpillars
[1:42:19] corrupting weakening disease
[1:42:24] not bearing fruit but spiritually are
[1:42:27] drying up
[1:42:29] destruction canker worms doing
[1:42:31] destructive work eating the bark of the
[1:42:33] tree
[1:42:34] eating deep within those that have
[1:42:38] gotten away from the nearness of the
[1:42:39] presence of the lord and the nearness of
[1:42:41] god
[1:42:42] that canker worm and that caterpillar
[1:42:44] begins to eat away your faith
[1:42:46] begins to eat away your joy and you
[1:42:48] become an unhealthy
[1:42:51] christian spiritually weak
[1:42:55] spiritually frail you know why that's
[1:42:59] that's why so much depression and
[1:43:01] anxiety and people are put on pills
[1:43:03] because
[1:43:04] depression and anxiety and worry and
[1:43:06] stress all the time
[1:43:11] prayerless half-hearted
[1:43:15] are you here tonight
[1:43:19] so weak joel joe begins to say oh lord
[1:43:24] in joel 2 verse 17 give not that
[1:43:26] inheritance or reproach
[1:43:28] that sin should rule over them why
[1:43:30] should people be saying
[1:43:32] where is their god it's what he says
[1:43:35] says oh
[1:43:36] lord he says don't give your thy
[1:43:38] heritage to reproach that the heathen
[1:43:40] should rule over them
[1:43:41] he's praying this this is the heart of
[1:43:43] joel and he's saying lord
[1:43:45] don't don't let it stay like this and
[1:43:47] god says i'm not going to let it stay
[1:43:49] like that
[1:43:50] i'm not going to let sin just dominate
[1:43:52] people's lives
[1:43:53] i'm not going to let your children be
[1:43:55] carried off at the foreign nations i'm
[1:43:57] not just going to let the canker worm
[1:43:58] continue to eat
[1:43:59] i'm not just going to let the
[1:44:00] caterpillar keep eating away
[1:44:02] and to get you to such a state of fear
[1:44:05] and anxiety
[1:44:06] but i'm going to restore all the years
[1:44:09] that they've eaten at you
[1:44:11] i'm going to bring your children back
[1:44:12] i'm going to bring and restore your joy
[1:44:14] i'm going to restore your happiness i'm
[1:44:17] going to restore

[1:44:23] lord all the damage
[1:44:25] all of the years that satan has had
[1:44:29] free reign and one day in one moment
[1:44:33] in one instant in one second might have
[1:44:36] ate away for years and years and years
[1:44:38] but in one supernatural moment my
[1:44:41] brother when you
[1:44:42] contact the lord jesus and when you
[1:44:44] really meet him down on your
[1:44:46] soul and he really does a change inside
[1:44:48] of you
[1:44:49] he makes you not he doesn't give you a
[1:44:51] renovation and and renovate your outward
[1:44:54] flesh he makes you a brand new
[1:44:56] person and god says years satan ate away
[1:44:59] but in one
[1:45:00] instant i'm gonna restore you i'm gonna
[1:45:03] take away
[1:45:03] all the caterpillars and all the
[1:45:05] diseases and all the bugs that have ate
[1:45:07] away
[1:45:07] and in one moment i'm gonna in an
[1:45:09] instant i'm gonna change what you
[1:45:10] couldn't change
[1:45:13] when you really meet the lord
[1:45:17] oh when you really meet the lord jesus
[1:45:20] and it's not just a mental experience
[1:45:22] not just a mental
[1:45:24] repentance or just because you mentally
[1:45:26] thought this or you became
[1:45:27] under conviction but i'm talking about a
[1:45:29] real experience in the holy spirit
[1:45:32] when you've really repented of your sins
[1:45:34] and god accepts that
[1:45:35] and god does something on you i just
[1:45:37] want to testify how many
[1:45:39] contests of how many sinners do we have
[1:45:41] that god has transformed and changed
[1:45:43] and you could say he completely changed
[1:45:45] me i couldn't change myself i tried
[1:45:48] self-help i tried psychiatry i tried to
[1:45:50] better myself
[1:45:51] but when jesus did something inside of
[1:45:53] me he did what nobody could do
[1:45:56] he did what he did and he did something
[1:45:57] to me that i couldn't do for myself
[1:46:01] he restored
