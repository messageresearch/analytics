TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Real cheerful verse here says, "Man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower and is cut down. He fleth also as a shadow and continuth not." Ask the Lord would put uh put a blessing on the reading of the words. you all be seated. Um I want to read uh I guess I'll I'll I'll start um just kind of I'll give you my title. Uh my title is just a question and it is why are we here, right? And I don't mean necessarily why are we in Bethl Tabernacle and this building on this day or why are we in Bufort or why are you know we in the place that we are in our life or anything like that. Although that is kind of partly tied into what I'm trying to get at here, but obviously there's like that deep question that people have been struggling with from the dawn of time, which is why is humanity here? What's our point? What's the purpose of all of this? Um, you know, to I took, you know, as the angsty youth that I was, you know, like the phrase life is pain and then you die, right? Life can be really miserable and it's suffer. There's a lot of suffering. It's pretty awful. You you're gonna you're going to suffer. You're going to you're going to be hurt. People are going to take advantage of you. You're going to be, you know, abused and abandoned or betrayed. You're going to fail yourself in a lot of ways. A lot of things that you thought you'd be better than and then it turns out you really were not better than, right? And a lot of times the people that hurt you the most is the guy in the mirror. And it's a lot of a lot of suffering and pain and people take advantage and and a lot of heartache that goes with life. And so the question is what's the point right why would we go through all this why would God who loves us put us in a situation in which we go through this you know go through all these difficult things right um James 4:13 go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not what shall be on the tomorrow for what is your life. It is even a vapor that appearth for a little time, then vanishth away, right? I mean, you you it's it's it's short. Life is short and painful. And at the end of it, your reward is dying, right? And that's that's a pretty bleak outlook on life. And a lot of people are in that place in the in this day and age. A lot of people have that outlook on life. Um because if there's no hope, that's all you've got, right? If there is no if there's no hope of redemption as Paul said, then eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die. Right? There's no hope for anything more, if there's no there's no reason for any of this, then then hedonism is your answer, right? Do all do all the drugs because that's all you've got, right? What I mean, if if there is no hope for tomorrow, if there's no brighter future that once they throw sod in your face, that's it, and it's over, then what's the argument, &gt;&gt; right? you've got one vapor to get all you can out of. And so, you know, and then even even then we say, well, our purpose is the is the is the Holy Ghost. And that's true. I'm not please don't take what I'm about to say as a dis discrediting of that. Um, but even then, you know, you get the Holy Ghost and and you got the the the Lord operating in your life and even then it doesn't fix everything, right? In Romans 7:18, for I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing. For for to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not. For the good that I would do, I do not, but the evil which I would not, that I do. So, here's Paul as a Holy Ghostfilled believer is still battling his flesh. He's still in a fight. It's still a fight. Even as Paul um you know as you know he he suffered greatly for the gospel even once you become a Christian there's it's not like life just becomes easy right if anything life gets a whole lot harder because now you know you know all right so in the Bible when it says the guilty prosper you know the wicked you know I mean all throughout the Bible there's different different people who have struggled with this like Lord why is it that I see wicked people have abundance why do evil people seem to prosper well it's Because the God of this world, which is not Jehovah, is not constantly oppressing them. He has no reason to. He's they're his children, right? And God has no reason to chastise them. They're not his children either, right? He God's not going to Why would God, you know, oppose their success? They're not his children. He doesn't chastise not his own. And Satan's not going to not going to bother them. You know, they may have some consequences of their own actions, but that's their own actions, right? You may have somebody, you know, fall into addiction or what what have you, but again, that's the consequences of their own actions. You could have people lie, cheat, and steal, and as long as they play their cards right, they'll be a millionaire on on on, you know, deception and lies. So, you know, but but the reason they can do that is because unlike the God's children, you know, if you're a child of God, you have the God of this age, the of the God of the whole world is directly opposed to you, right? He's going to fight you. You're going to be in a fight. You wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers of the air. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are fighting against you know like the entire world has been constructed all the societies of the world all the the the um entertainment the the the culture the politics all of it every government there's a secret mastermind behind all of it and they're aiming everything that they have to shut you down to break you spiritually. That's what all of this is about. And so again, we got to wonder why are we doing this? Why would God do this? Why on earth would God, who loves us, put us in this sort of situation where it's a constant fight and it's a constant struggle. There was a um a um I heard this saying a long time ago. Um I've heard it a lot of different places, but it was kind of popularized by a guy by the name of Victor Frankle. Um he was a psychologist. He's also um survived the Holocaust. Um and he picked it up from um I believe the person who actually originally kind of coined this phrase was um Frederick Nichi. But the phrase is he who has a why to live, a why to live for can bear almost anyh how. Okay? If you have a why to live for, you can bear anyh how. Okay? In other words, if you've got a real reason to live, if there's something really driving you and motivating you to live, no matter what the circumstances of your life are, you will bear it. Okay? I heard a a story of a of a soldier. He was a um army ranger in um when they uh invaded um Iraq. And he talked a lot about how he got in a lot of situations where their first several months they were every single day for like 12 plus hours a day they're kicking in doors and getting in gunfights. We're talking multiple gunfights a day, right? For months on end. And he's like, "You cannot go through that when you get like there was a lot of people." And these are guys who went through Ranger the Ranger program, right? They're they're trained. A lot of them were were veterans of some regard. and they get in the middle of it and they and once things get really bad and you're in the middle of a city where everybody hates you and everyone's trying to kill you and every other day your convoy's getting hit by by IEDs and and ambushes, a lot of guys broke. They broke mentally. They couldn't do it anymore. They completely caved in. They lost the will to fight because they had no reason to fight. But this guy pushed through all of it. He said that and himself and himself and all the other guys who persevered and were able to push through and didn't end up with a lot of mental problems. It was because they had to get through every single day because he said of himself, I knew that back home there was a girl and a baby and if I didn't come home they were going to be without. He had a reason to fight. No matter how nasty things got and no matter how difficult and dangerous things were, he was able to face firefight after firefight without losing his mind because he had a wife and a baby to go home to at the end of all of it. There was somebody who was depending on him. He had something because the and he said what happens is when you're in a situation where life and death is on the line, when death becomes easier than life, you'll choose death. Right? When when it when the choice is offered to you, when death is easier than life, you'll choose death. And a lot of people just stop would in combat in warfare, a lot of people just stop fighting and they just give up and die because it's too hard. It's too much. Man wasn't built to survive that kind of environment. We weren't built for that. And so what happens the the the goal is to give people a why, right? If we're going to wrestle against the power principalities of the air, if we're going to fight the armies of of the enemy, if we're going to buckle down and truly be soldiers in the army of God, we have to have a why, right? You got to have a reason. It's it's it's more than just um you have to have a purpose. If you don't, you will cave, right? When when when if you do not have a reason to continue on, when you do not have a reason to bear your cross, then dropping the cross is always going to be easier, right? Dropping it and walking away is always going to be easier than taking up your cross. So we can see this in in Proverbs 29:18. Where there is no vision, the people perish. But he that keepeth the law happy is he. Without vision, right, that word vision specifically means uh is referenced to what we would think of as like a prophetic vision. It it it a synonym for that might be revelation like divine revelation or prophecy without having the word of God being revealed to us on a daily basis in our lives. Um we are going to perish. the word parish there, uh, if you kind of look into that, the the Hebrew root for that, a different way of translating that might not necessarily be parish, but more like um relaxing the standards, right? A way of a way of um reading this might be where there is no open revelation, the people just do whatever they want, right? People just just live any old kind of way. And and the reason for that is you constantly need the word of God. You constantly need revelation to constantly be driving you, constantly be encouraging you, constantly be be pushing you. Um because without that, you're just going to you're just going to you'll die. You won't have the strength to keep fighting. Now, I do want to I want to notice something. When we're looking for purpose, if we're we recognize that in this day and age, we have to have a true understanding of why it is that we're doing what we're doing, why we are fighting. Um what's the what's the end goal of all this? Why would God because it's not like God doesn't expect God will not expect his children to do something that he won't do himself, right? That's why he came to earth as a man and suffered and died as a man. God doesn't expect his children to suffer without being right there with you, right? There's a lot of tears that God has shed too, right? And why would God put himself through all of that if there's no reason? If it's all just meaningless. So God has a reason. God has a purpose. All of this had has a has a a purpose. And so if we look in the very beginning is God is Elohim, the self-existing one. God has no purpose. He's just existing. He's not doing anything, right? He's not even God technically because God is an object of worship and there's no one there to worship him. And so God first he makes the angels and and you know he gets worship but that wasn't satisfying. That didn't give him a purpose of being. So God made a family says this is from marriage and divorce. At the beginning, way back before there was a beginning, he wasn't even God. Did you know that God is an object of worship? And there wasn't nothing to worship him. He lived alone. And in him was attributes. Notice he was his attributes that was in him. Now it was in him to be a father. It was in him to be God. It was in him to be son. It was in in him to be savior. It was in him to be healer. And all these things here are just displaying his attributes. There's nothing out of order. You think God didn't see the end from the beginning? Certainly he did. There's nothing out of order. It's just displaying his attributes. Right? So we would think, oh, did God make a mistake by making a a a world in which his children might suffer or in which he might suffer? No. He knows the end from the beginning. But he has attributes inside of him that have to be expressed. Right? It's to fulfill himself to to find to to achieve the the fulfillment of who he is. There has to be an opportunity for those attributes to come out. Um man, time is I uh I I this thought that I'm working on it. It's a lot bigger than what I what I anticipated. And it was like um when I was putting a lot of my notes together this morning, I was like uh so like yesterday I had a cheeseburger and um I I grill I like eating burgers and I I am like I I want a big burger. So I have two patties and I have like all this the fixings and I put pimeino cheese on it. It's delicious but it's so big I can't get my my jaws around it. I can't get it between my teeth. So you kind of squish it and all the cheese flers out the side. Um and it makes a big mess. Um but it's delicious. It's a delicious mess. Anyways, that's kind of how I feel about this. I'm probably making a a mess, but look, there's a lot to it. All right, I'm trying to get my teeth around it. So, anyways, so God has a purpose, right? He has a purpose and and it the purpose is his family. What's going to bring fulfillment fulfillment to God? What's going to allow him to to achieve all of his attributes is all the suffering. It's all the it's all the difficulty that's going to come from this world because he can't be a savior unless there's someone to be saved. He can't be a father unless he has children. To be a father means to be a provider. You can't provide if you don't have if the if nobody has a need, right? He can't be a provider unless somebody has a need. He can't be a healer unless any nobody ever got sick. So, um this is so he he's he's creating a world in which he can he can take off a piece of himself and and put it into humanity. Um, and it this is from uh oneness, the sermon oneness in 1962. He says that's God's purpose. Straight up. That's God's purpose. And by the way, the the previous paragraph is him is brother Bram describing a family, right? He's describing a family in perfect order. And he says that's God's purpose. And his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family, earthly family, Adam and Eve. And the only way that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them. So that made them with God's nature in them. Then with each other and God, they became all one. Isn't that a beautiful picture? God in his family, father over all. So God in his desire to have reason and purpose of being made a family. Then in Genesis 1 uh verse 27, so God created man in his own image, and the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and foul of the air, and over every living thing that moveth on the earth." Then God saw that man was just like himself. This is just my my commentary. Then God saw or when God saw that uh man was just like himself and would also need a family to have reason for being. Okay. So God makes man. And then the in Genesis chapter 2 it says in the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone. I will make him a help meat for him. So God makes man in his image, right? God's alone. He needs a family. So he expresses that into man. Man's alone and he needs a family because why? He's just a reflection of God. It's the same thing just just replicating down. Um just uh help me for him. And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see um what he would call them. And whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowls of the air and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found an help meat for him. So just like God made the angels, right? God needed some, you know, he was alone. So he made angels, but the angels didn't do it for him. The angels didn't satisfy the the need for companionship. It took a family to do that. Same thing with Adam. He has all companionship of all the beasts of the field. He has a dominion. He has a job to do. He has work, you know, and that's man, this is if I was a preacher, I might preach on that. Um, a lot of people, a lot of men when they're in in their family, they will go bury themselves in their job. They'll go bury themselves in a hobby. They'll go bury themselves in a lot of different things looking for purpose, right? And if they don't find it there, then they'll go find it in a bottle, right? Or or, you know, somewhere else. They'll go find people will look for something. And a lot of people look for something other everywhere other than what God intended you to have as your purpose for being, which is your family. God gave you a family, an actual flesh and blood family. That is your purpose in life. God didn't just tell people to be fruitful and multiply for no reason. It's not just empty words, right? There is there is a purpose hum the foundation for human purpose and and and desire to live. The reason you get up every day and and face the suffering of the world is because you have a family. You have a wife or a husband and children and that is what God gave you to to give you purpose in the in in this day. Right? So many people in this modern time, young people across the world and especially in America have a we're having mental health crisises. Um, suicide rates amongst young people is astronomically high. Nobody knows what what's going on. Well, maybe it's because for the last 60, 70 years, we've taken a wrecking ball to the concept of the family. Young men, if you feel purposeless in life, go get married and have a kid. You will have a reason to get out of bed every morning. I promise. Right, young women, get married, have a baby, right? All of your like doom scrolling goes out the window. The baby's crying, right? Your reason for being is is right there in the very beginning, right? God God made man to have a wife and he made the man and the wife together to be fruitful and multiply and have kids and to make a family. That's what they're we're here for. And we can get into this. I'm out of time. Like I said, it you know, all the my burger's falling apart here. Um we'll have to, you know, take it in in a second sitting some other time. Eat it with a fork. Um but look, the fact of the matter is there's not a coincidence. the fact that the family that the that the in the modern day that the the society that we live in the the Satan's Eden, the god of this evil age has taken a wrecking ball to the family and the structure of family that God laid out specifically. A lot of people want to have a family, but it's not according to God's word. And so God's the one who decides what a family is, right? Just because you think you have a family, if it's not according to God's word, no, you don't. It's you're going to end up with problems. It's gonna it's not if you're wondering why your family isn't fulfilling, have you wondered what if it's in accordance with God's word, right? If if if you feel alone in your marriage, are you sure it's according to God's word? You know, if parents feel, you know, like their children, there's a wedge between them and their and their children, do we wonder if that's maybe the family's not according to the word. Maybe that's what's going on, right? Um I I'll end with this I'll end with this uh just read this excerpt this quote and I'll and I'll quit. Um this is the paragraph that I said you know brother man was describing a family from oneness. Now the ma first man and first woman in the garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve. Now that is perfect oneness. God and his creation. God speaking lipto ear with Adam and Eve. And they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God. God and his family was one. Any man and his family. A correct, good, noble, obedient family is one with another. Any family. And if there's something in the family that moves them apart, then it's not right. The family's broken somewhere. They should all be one. Father with mother, mother with father, children with parent, parent with children, all in agreement. And when you see that, you'll see one lovely picture. That's God's purpose. Okay, I'll I'll stop. God bless you guys.
