[15:04] i was so
[15:06] scarred
[15:07] by sin

[15:13] despair
[15:15] he started over
[15:19] again
[15:22] and i
[15:24] am blessed today
[15:26] he didn't throw
[15:29] the clay away
[15:34] over and over singing out
[15:36] over
[15:39] [Music]
[15:45] and makes me
[15:48] into
[15:51] his likeness
[15:53] [Music]
[16:05] of
[16:06] honor that i
[16:09] am today
[16:13] and it's
[16:14] all because jesus
[16:19] didn't throw
[16:21] [Music]
[16:26] he is
[16:30] [Music]
[16:44] sally wants me
[16:47] to stay
[16:49] [Music]
[17:02] he picks up the broken he says
[17:07] [Music]
[17:13] [Music]
[17:18] and over
[17:21] he molds me
[17:24] and makes me
[17:27] into
[17:29] his likeness
[17:31] [Music]
[17:36] [Applause]
[17:40] a vessel
[17:43] of
[17:44] honor that i
[17:47] am today

[18:11] he holds me and makes me
[18:17] into
[18:20] his
[18:20] likeness
[18:22] he fashions
[18:25] the claims
[18:27] [Applause]
[18:29] [Music]
[18:33] of honor
[18:36] that i
[18:38] am today
[18:41] and it's all
[18:43] because jesus
[18:47] didn't throw
[18:49] oh let's see that first verse
[18:51] sing that first verse one more time
[18:53] empty and
[18:54] broken empty
[18:58] and broken
[19:01] i came back
[19:04] to you
[19:06] a vessel
[19:09] not worthy
[19:11] i was so scarred
[19:14] by sin
[19:17] but he did not
[19:20] despair
[19:22] he started over
[19:25] again
[19:28] and i
[19:30] blessed that day

[20:01] the claims
[20:07] [Music]
[20:15] this is the reason
[20:17] and it's
[20:18] all because jesus
[20:22] he didn't
[20:24] improve one more time
[20:26] over and over
[20:30] [Music]
[20:34] and over
[20:36] he molds me

[20:53] [Applause]
[20:56] [Music]
[21:01] that i
[21:02] am today
[21:06] and it's all because jesus
[21:11] didn't throw
[21:13] us
[21:19] [Music]
[21:28] and it makes me
[21:31] into
[21:34] his lightness
[21:38] [Music]
[21:53] [Applause]
[21:56] [Music]
[21:58] jesus

[22:32] and um
[22:33] i want you just to everyone just to feel
[22:36] right at home

[22:42] praise the lord i'm happy to be a part
[22:44] of the family
[22:46] of god

[22:55] amen i like i like my family quite a bit
[22:58] but i like actually that family even
[23:00] better

[23:04] family's part of that family i'm just
[23:06] like it can't get gooder than that
[23:10] amen
[23:11] praise the lord well we're happy in the
[23:13] lord we want to
[23:15] just give you a quick prayer request i
[23:17] did hear it mentioned
[23:20] but i just wanted to kind of give a
[23:22] little bit of an updated
[23:24] version
[23:25] um
[23:27] one request is for
[23:30] uh sister brenda
[23:32] that she found out a family member near
[23:35] her
[23:36] that if that a family member
[23:39] who was near her and around her indoors
[23:42] for several days
[23:44] who was very sick actually tested
[23:46] positive for covid she's asking us to
[23:48] pray that the lord shields her from
[23:50] getting ill now she did get a covet test
[23:53] and she sent me a text this morning
[23:54] saying it was negative so we just want
[23:56] to pray that that will stay
[23:59] because we realize the lord takes care
[24:02] but who wants to be sick amen not me
[24:06] and so also she asks a very sincere
[24:08] prayer for her mom
[24:10] who's really struggling with anxiety and
[24:13] fear over the loss of her husband she
[24:15] said her mom just

[24:51] i told her
[24:52] it's all going out her feet
[24:55] because the enemy is under her feet
[24:59] he said and under her feet uh her feet
[25:02] in victory
[25:03] she is eating better and nausea has left
[25:06] her praise our lord and i am pampering

[26:04] brother
[26:05] jack was sir we can't find anything
[26:07] wrong with
[26:08] her hallelujah so the lord i tell you
[26:12] prayer doesn't just change things it
[26:13] changes everything
[26:16] so we're happy
[26:17] uh for the lord's great provision
[26:20] for us and god still moves doesn't he
[26:22] amen so i wanted just to give you those
[26:25] updates

[26:53] one
[26:54] two verses
[26:56] john st john chapter 4
[26:59] verse 23 and 24.
[27:03] amen i apologize to those who were
[27:06] trying to stream the sunday school this
[27:07] morning the video looked amazing but
[27:10] we had an audio
[27:11] cross up and it didn't exactly have any
[27:14] sound
[27:15] so hopefully i asked gideon if that be
[27:18] in the archive i hope sound is in the
[27:20] archive amen we're getting a head shake
[27:22] of no amen well it's in the archive of
[27:25] heaven anyway
[27:26] so if you were faithful and loyal enough
[27:28] to be here for sunday school class you
[27:30] got the benefit amen and if you weren't
[27:32] oh well
[27:35] amen praise the lord
[27:37] saint john chapter 4 verse 23 i'm not
[27:41] going to read right in chapter 18. will
[27:43] i
[27:45] saint john chapter 4
[27:48] and verse 23 and 24 jesus speaking
[27:53] but the hour cometh and now is
[27:56] when the true worshipers shall worship
[27:58] the father in spirit
[28:01] and in truth
[28:02] for the father seeketh such
[28:05] to worship him god is a spirit
[28:08] and they that worship him
[28:10] must worship him in spirit and in truth
[28:15] amen let's bow our heads father we thank
[28:18] you for your word today
[28:20] and i
[28:22] i
[28:23] lord confess and ask an extra grace from
[28:27] thee this morning you know the
[28:29] the struggle i've had trying to decipher
[28:33] lord with so much to say knowing i
[28:35] couldn't say it all and trying to find
[28:37] your exact path
[28:39] this morning proved a little difficult
[28:41] but
[28:42] lord i i felt your nearness in the back
[28:45] office and i'm sure that you have
[28:48] ready now you have it you have it ready
[28:50] to go and we're we want to hear it with
[28:53] open hearts today and i pray for your
[28:56] grace upon the speaker and the hearer we
[28:59] commit ourselves humbly to you
[29:01] completely to you we're not deserving
[29:04] actually of any of your grace and mercy
[29:06] but lord
[29:07] if we did deserve it well it wouldn't be
[29:09] grace and mercy so i'm i in that regard
[29:13] lord i'm glad i don't deserve it because
[29:15] now i can be a recipient of your great
[29:18] grace and mercy
[29:20] so i committed to you now in jesus name
[29:23] amen god bless you
[29:26] you can be seated
[29:46] i want i would like to by the help of
[29:48] the lord
[29:50] continue from
[29:52] the last time i ministered on finding
[29:54] god's current and i'm not continuing
[29:57] that thought per se
[29:59] but i i want to take a rather natural
[30:03] uh extrapolation from that and so
[30:06] i i want to just read a quote
[30:09] that i read near the very end of that
[30:12] sermon it probably was exactly my last
[30:14] quote made my last one or two comments
[30:16] from from this quote and this will help
[30:19] you to help me to recapture and get your
[30:22] minds set to where we want to go
[30:24] and we want to be in prayer also for a
[30:26] couple of families who are out of town
[30:28] traveling just the lord give them mercy
[30:31] amen brother branham says
[30:33] from um so i want to speak to you today
[30:36] on the power within the spirit
[30:39] and the truth
[30:41] uh if you'll notice that jesus said
[30:44] the hour cometh and now is
[30:48] when the true worshipers
[30:50] shall worship the father in spirit and
[30:53] in truth now watch this next line
[30:57] for the father seeketh such to worship
[31:00] him
[31:01] now you wouldn't say that if you were
[31:03] perfectly happy with the worship you
[31:05] were getting
[31:07] amen
[31:08] so it becomes obvious in what jesus is
[31:11] saying that that god wasn't finished
[31:15] perfecting praise he wasn't he hadn't
[31:18] arrived yet
[31:19] at what his great vision was for his
[31:22] family amen
[31:24] remember how that jesus
[31:26] goes back and picks up under inspiration
[31:29] he picks up the prophet and says in
[31:32] sacrifices and in offerings thou has had
[31:35] no pleasure amen remember that because
[31:38] brother branham said you know mount
[31:40] sinai that was that was the most
[31:42] rational thing the children of israel
[31:44] ever did when they actually had thus
[31:47] saith the lord they had a prophet they
[31:49] had a pillar of fire had a brazen altar
[31:51] brazen serpent they had every provision
[31:53] they could ever need for making it into
[31:56] the promised land like brother branham
[31:57] said everything you have need of for a
[32:00] rapture is in you now
[32:03] in you now praise the lord brother you
[32:06] from brother shawn's praise the lord god
[32:08] bless you we're happy to have you here
[32:09] today visiting us from brother sean
[32:10] martin's assembly amen so brother sean
[32:14] is a awesome friend
[32:16] and so we we find that
[32:19] that when you when you think about it in
[32:22] this light jesus went on to say that
[32:25] it is it is written of me
[32:28] in the scrolls
[32:30] that i come to do thy will o lord and so
[32:33] so jesus is now trying to get them to
[32:36] understand that there is a new day
[32:39] dawning and it's not
[32:41] new as in the sense of nothing like it
[32:44] has ever existed but it is now the next
[32:47] advancement it is now the next step
[32:49] in the goal that god had when he said
[32:53] let there be
[32:55] the first time brother branham shows us
[32:57] in
[32:58] uh christ is the mystery of god revealed
[33:01] that
[33:01] that everything in all the bible and all
[33:04] the lives and everything you read he
[33:07] said god had one goal
[33:09] just one
[33:10] and he said now we're going to take this
[33:12] morning and we're going to find out what
[33:14] that one goal is and when you listen to
[33:15] the sermon you realize that it's all
[33:18] about expression god unfolding his
[33:22] expression because god wasn't he wasn't
[33:25] he wasn't satisfied to be alone with his
[33:27] thoughts in heaven amen he wanted a
[33:30] family but he knew
[33:32] that there's a difference in just
[33:34] speaking something into existence like
[33:36] you know like you create and the bible
[33:38] says he created hell for the devil and
[33:41] his angels right but we know that hell
[33:44] death and hell are cast in the lake of
[33:46] fire so hell's not eternal
[33:48] you understand that's just something he
[33:50] temporarily created for a temporary
[33:53] purpose but he didn't he didn't he
[33:55] didn't create his family that way
[33:58] because like brother branham said if you
[34:00] take a piece of paper and he said and
[34:02] you burn it
[34:03] you'd say well i've annihilated it now
[34:06] he said no you actually can't annihilate
[34:08] anything only god can do that he said
[34:11] well i i burned it so well all you've
[34:13] done is turned it back to its original
[34:15] atoms and gases and molecules
[34:17] it's not it's not paper is a
[34:18] manufactured item from wood and so
[34:21] you've reversed all of the
[34:23] the manufacturing you reversed the the
[34:25] tree growing you reversed the seed in
[34:27] the ground you went all the way back to
[34:29] the elements that actually spoke the
[34:32] seed and grew a tree and was cut down
[34:34] and turned into paper
[34:36] brother branham said if time would go on
[34:38] long enough those elements could be
[34:40] repurposed into paper again sometime
[34:43] see
[34:43] so so god wasn't interested in a bride
[34:47] that would someday maybe pass away and
[34:50] have to start all the way over he was
[34:52] going to express a bride he was going to
[34:55] express a heavens and an earth and
[34:57] that's why the earth is part of his
[35:00] eternal attribute and can't ever be
[35:01] annihilated see so even when peter says
[35:04] i saw new heavens and new earth brother
[35:06] madam shows us clearly in future home
[35:08] doesn't mean it was annihilated can't be
[35:09] annihilated it's an internal attribute
[35:11] you can't be annihilated
[35:13] that's why you can't go to the lake of
[35:15] fire because you'd be annihilated and
[35:17] you can't be annihilated
[35:20] oh my friends and so you know uh there
[35:24] there's two ways to look at god as an
[35:26] all-consuming fire and i don't want that
[35:29] all consuming fire but i do want this
[35:31] all-consuming fire to consume me oh lord
[35:34] consume all my plans motives dreams and
[35:37] objectives me as a person and let me as
[35:40] a phoenix rising from the ashes be
[35:43] recreated in the image of god is that
[35:45] your desire today as a believer i hope
[35:48] it is or i don't know why you're a
[35:49] believer right amen i don't there's a
[35:52] lot more there's many many many
[35:54] thousands more
[35:56] christian
[35:57] nominal movements and countless hundreds
[35:59] of independents who have a much less
[36:01] rigorous uh you know if
[36:03] and and of course if you're born again
[36:06] serving god's not not rigor
[36:08] it's actually a pleasure it's actually
[36:10] natural you're on you unconsciously live
[36:12] that way because you've been you've had
[36:14] a nature change if you haven't if you've
[36:16] only had enough some people only get
[36:18] enough religion to make themselves
[36:20] miserable
[36:22] that's a sad sad situation to be and you
[36:24] don't ever want to be that i can tell
[36:25] you that's not why god sent the message
[36:27] that's not why he made you a believer uh
[36:29] you know but but you don't want to be uh
[36:32] you know brother jd was talking
[36:33] yesterday in the men's breakfast how
[36:35] that you know some people
[36:37] um you know they're they're kind it
[36:39] reminded me as he was describing it it
[36:41] reminded me of paul coming to those to
[36:43] those scholars on mars hill and the
[36:46] bible says
[36:47] you know it shows it looked like they
[36:49] were like all excited about paul's
[36:50] message and oh please come back and
[36:52] preach for us again but actually what
[36:54] was behind it was they just loved
[36:56] hearing something new
[36:58] yeah
[36:59] paul said i i noticed the other day in
[37:00] the market you had a
[37:02] an idol a temple to the unknown god i'd
[37:05] like to tell you his name
[37:07] and they wanted to hear more because it
[37:09] was it was uh exciting it was you know
[37:12] and and and so we find that some people
[37:15] you know love conspiracy love you know
[37:18] intrigue love something that's juicy and
[37:20] wow that's that's new that's intriguing
[37:23] you know you don't hear that airing
[37:25] every day and and and that's and they
[37:27] come to the message because the message
[37:29] identifies the dragon and the beast and
[37:31] the powers and and and shows what's
[37:33] happening in history and everybody's
[37:35] like oh man oh wow wow and they said in
[37:37] message churches 5 10 15 20 25 30 40
[37:40] years
[37:41] amen and suddenly
[37:43] oh well i'm moving on
[37:45] see
[37:46] because because the message didn't come
[37:48] for that it didn't come to entertain you
[37:51] it came to restore you back to something
[37:54] you've got to always remember that that
[37:57] that that when you when you when you
[37:59] look at why every everything god did
[38:02] since the fall in the garden of eden has
[38:05] been one his final three-phase plan
[38:08] ends up first to reveal himself in
[38:11] christ then to get preeminence in his
[38:14] body the church down through two
[38:15] thousand years of church ages right but
[38:18] then to restore us back to our rightly
[38:20] position that fell by sin in the garden
[38:23] so he's we're being restored back to
[38:25] that fellowship that adam had because
[38:27] adam didn't have to be adam didn't have
[38:30] to be brought into the image of god
[38:33] adam was born in the image of god adam
[38:36] came forth in fact is his first thing
[38:38] was a spirit man and then later he's put
[38:40] him into soil and be god breathes into
[38:42] his breath nostrils the breath of life
[38:44] he becomes a living soul and so adam
[38:47] came from thought and then was word and
[38:50] then was flesh like jesus that's why
[38:52] he's the second adam jesus was came from
[38:55] god as an expression he was the logos
[38:57] the word and then he became flesh now
[38:59] brother branham said
[39:01] you
[39:02] bypassed that middle stage you came
[39:05] right from thought to flesh for to
[39:07] receive your temptations because god's
[39:09] not interested in a kingdom full of
[39:11] robots
[39:13] he rather god would rather have you lost
[39:16] and saved
[39:18] god would rather have you
[39:20] with failures and forgiven
[39:23] that's hard to get your mind around but
[39:25] that gives him reason and purpose for
[39:27] being that's what we're taught that it
[39:30] was necessary that god permit a man to
[39:33] be born in sin then god could come and
[39:36] save him and brother branham says that
[39:38] gave him reason and purpose for being
[39:40] you won't talk about blowing fuses wow
[39:43] that want to blow fuses
[39:44] see so
[39:46] so you find that that that what happens
[39:49] is now you come
[39:50] you bypass your word
[39:53] form you came straight from his thoughts
[39:55] his genes to be expressed in flesh
[39:59] and
[40:00] you are now being restored
[40:03] and the bible says glory upon glory upon
[40:07] glory upon glory you see so you're being
[40:10] restored back glory upon glory upon
[40:13] glory adam didn't have to do that but
[40:15] you have to do that amen see
[40:18] so we find that
[40:20] that he he's saying here there's coming
[40:23] a worship
[40:24] that the father hasn't yet got to enjoy
[40:28] and they've been worshipping
[40:30] i mean
[40:31] think about the mind of god he's been
[40:35] receiving worship for 4
[40:38] 000 years at this point 4 000 years
[40:42] amen
[40:44] and he's not he's not reached his
[40:46] satisfaction place yet
[40:48] he's got a whole nother
[40:50] a whole another expression now we're
[40:52] getting ready to go into the next phase
[40:55] and this is going to be the phase of the
[40:57] era of the holy ghost jesus lived
[41:00] his life that brother branham said that
[41:02] was the christian era because it was
[41:04] christ he was alive on the earth three
[41:06] three and a half years
[41:08] by roman calendar three years on a
[41:09] jewish calendar but he was there
[41:11] and
[41:12] but now when the holy ghost comes
[41:13] brother and says now since then we've
[41:15] lived in the holy ghost
[41:17] age the holy ghost era we've lived under
[41:20] the pentecostal feast the jubilee all
[41:22] right you got that right
[41:23] now so
[41:25] so brother branham comes here
[41:28] in exposition of the seven church ages
[41:31] and the laodicean age by the way
[41:34] excuse me and i read this last time now
[41:36] no chastening
[41:38] for the present seemeth to be joyous
[41:41] but grievous i can say amen to that
[41:44] no chastening seems joyous
[41:47] seems grievous
[41:49] nevertheless
[41:51] nevertheless
[41:52] afterward
[41:53] it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
[41:56] righteousness
[41:58] unto them
[42:00] which are exercised thereby and i i made
[42:04] a comment to you in my closing remarks
[42:06] last time that that some may not have
[42:10] uh much interest in this peaceable fruit
[42:14] of righteousness but i do
[42:16] i do
[42:17] i declared that to you last time i get
[42:20] it most of the world and and you know i
[42:24] there's nothing i can do about that
[42:26] because i'm not a messenger to the whole
[42:29] world i'm a i'm an angel a messenger an
[42:32] earthly messenger sent to this local
[42:34] community
[42:36] and you are the sheep who god has
[42:39] committed to my charge
[42:40] and that's all i am i'm just a little
[42:43] shepherd on the side of a hill somewhere
[42:46] and the father said here's some lambs
[42:49] and take them into their life and bring
[42:51] them back to me mature grown and bearing
[42:54] wool and that's what i'm doing amen if
[42:57] you wonder what i'm doing that's what
[42:59] i'm doing
[43:00] if you wonder what your tithing supports
[43:02] supports that
[43:04] and sometimes i have to do and say
[43:06] things that that that make you want to
[43:09] stop paying your tithing
[43:13] oh boy
[43:17] but all i'm doing is trying to grow you
[43:19] all i'm doing is trying to bring you to
[43:22] something see and i'm trying to get
[43:23] there myself
[43:25] amen isn't that i mean you say that's
[43:28] kind of a dumb plan yeah the bible
[43:30] actually uses a harsher word the
[43:32] foolishness of preaching
[43:34] that god uses an imperfect man to
[43:36] perfect imperfect people
[43:40] okay
[43:41] all i can do is acquiesce all i can do
[43:44] and that means to reluctantly agree
[43:46] because it's it's not something i ever
[43:48] craved or chased in my life it's hard
[43:50] enough and you know as well as me it's
[43:52] hard enough being responsible for your
[43:53] own self
[43:54] without having to be responsible for
[43:56] everybody else but such is my lot in
[43:59] life and i just say i rejoice and i just
[44:01] say blessed be the name of the lord then
[44:03] if i gotta do it well i'm gonna do it
[44:06] i'm gonna do it i'm gonna go all in i'm
[44:08] gonna go all at it and and the only time
[44:11] i that it becomes grievous to me is when
[44:14] i find myself not being all in and i say
[44:16] come on man stand up get going
[44:19] yeah you got a job to do come on friends
[44:21] the the the whole the whole uh mentality
[44:25] of the world is all about a free lunch
[44:28] and give me something free and i don't
[44:29] wanna work and i don't wanna trial and i
[44:31] don't wanna you know i just wanna just
[44:33] give me give me give me give me what
[44:34] have you i know what you did for me last
[44:36] month but hey what have you done for me
[44:38] lately
[44:40] and that's that's feeding the neurosis
[44:42] that that's what's causing everybody
[44:45] thinks that oh everybody's got to accept
[44:47] me and i've got to be celebrated and i
[44:49] and i and if i if somebody offends me
[44:52] then i'm going to have to take an action
[44:53] oh good grief you know the bible says
[44:56] that whenever you get to feeling that
[44:58] way and you start fainting in your own
[45:00] faith said here's what you do consider
[45:03] the lord jesus
[45:05] who endured such a contradiction of
[45:08] sinners against himself uh my my
[45:10] monitors went away completely if you can
[45:12] give me just a little bit of that back
[45:14] uh g-man i would appreciate it not a
[45:17] whole lot i don't like a ton but i had a
[45:18] little more a minute ago
[45:20] and so
[45:22] so you find that
[45:24] that god has us here
[45:26] and these peaceable fruits of
[45:28] righteousness and i i'm on a quest today
[45:32] you know now
[45:33] not a virtual reality game
[45:35] come on all right
[45:37] i'm not here to finish some level
[45:39] all right i'm here i'm here to find
[45:43] and enjoy
[45:44] the peaceable fruits of righteousness
[45:47] and i i told you last night i told you
[45:49] last time that it's all i think about
[45:51] night and day well i want to tell you
[45:52] today my quest continues
[45:55] are you on the same quest today my quest
[45:58] continues i'm trying to find celestial
[46:00] city hallelujah i started at the wicked
[46:03] gate and i went through many hard places
[46:05] but i'm pressing on
[46:08] hallelujah
[46:10] i've got plenty of companions to go
[46:12] along with me
[46:14] amen
[46:16] if i get sideways evangelists will show
[46:18] up and straighten me out and
[46:20] pull me out of the miry clay amen for
[46:22] those of you who've never read pilgrim's
[46:23] progress i feel sorry for you
[46:27] so most wonderful book about the
[46:29] christian life you'll ever read in your
[46:31] life
[46:32] amen it's the brother brown said the two
[46:34] books abraham lincoln kept constantly
[46:36] was the pilgrim's progress in his bible
[46:39] and so you know
[46:41] i i i last time i
[46:43] when i was talking about finding the
[46:46] uh
[46:47] current of god for your life
[46:50] and i i so appreciated you know the
[46:52] testimony you heard brother kenny give
[46:54] that testimony
[46:56] wednesday
[46:58] about he had heard that sermon
[47:01] and he remembered a story about when he
[47:03] was a marine you remember and he swam
[47:05] out and suddenly a current
[47:08] wanted to take him somewhere he didn't
[47:09] want to go remember that
[47:11] and brother kenny started swimming
[47:13] against it and fighting against it and
[47:15] trying to swim against the current
[47:18] and actually was ending up drowning he
[47:21] was in the process of drowning all right
[47:25] and so he said something just spoke to
[47:28] him and said just relax
[47:32] go with it
[47:33] and brother kenny with no training of
[47:35] that no one had ever told him that's
[47:37] what you do he just relaxed you know why
[47:40] god did that because god saw brother
[47:41] kenny sitting among us
[47:43] god saw a family god saw sister anita
[47:46] and she's going to need a husband he saw
[47:47] children they're going to need a dad we
[47:49] he saw a church and we're going to need
[47:50] a song leader amen
[47:55] and so
[47:56] so brother kenny just laid back in the
[47:59] current
[48:00] and he quit struggling and the current
[48:03] the current saved his life
[48:07] you understand he was dying trying to go
[48:10] against the current and and my whole
[48:12] point was there is a current of god in
[48:16] the upper atmospheres or in the sea of
[48:18] life
[48:20] and god has that current for you and he
[48:22] has a it's predestinated to take you
[48:24] somewhere and as long as you will just
[48:27] let yourself go into that current you'll
[48:29] arrive safely it's when you try to swim
[48:32] against
[48:33] doggedly determined to keep your own
[48:36] current
[48:37] and to swim to your own destination
[48:41] and that's when you run into problems
[48:44] you're you're you know i told the story
[48:46] of being in a jetliner over the pacific
[48:48] and they had to make an unscheduled stop
[48:49] because they ran out of gas
[48:51] because the pilot said from the time he
[48:53] lifted up from lax they ran into an
[48:55] unforeseen strong headwind and he had to
[48:58] give it the juice and he burned up all
[49:00] of his gas and had to land on a u.s
[49:02] airfield to refuel mid
[49:04] mid flight unscheduled
[49:06] see and so so that's what happens when
[49:09] you try to fly against the current when
[49:12] you try to swim against the current god
[49:14] has a predestinated path for your life
[49:18] you need to slip into that slipstream
[49:22] amen
[49:24] and i i asked you last time
[49:27] from an article i had read about
[49:29] questions concerning decisions and i
[49:32] i feel that these questions
[49:35] say you know why why would you what was
[49:37] the real purpose behind those questions
[49:39] and here it is it's just an honest
[49:41] shepherd's heart
[49:42] i felt that these questions
[49:45] could cause
[49:47] the the much needed
[49:49] deeper
[49:50] introspection
[49:52] that we often overlook
[49:55] we often
[49:56] overlook
[49:57] we get in too big of a hurry we act too
[50:00] quickly prophet said don't
[50:02] don't be hasty amen don't be hasty
[50:06] see
[50:06] and these questions they are they were
[50:09] thought provoking for decisions that we
[50:12] make or are making or if i'm counseling
[50:15] you and you're coming to me and you've
[50:17] got to make a decision you've got to
[50:19] make some life choices they were simple
[50:21] straightforward questions and you all
[50:23] agreed with me
[50:25] sensibly they're very good questions
[50:28] and every decision you make you should
[50:30] ask yourself these questions have you
[50:33] question number one have you carefully
[50:34] thought this through
[50:36] question number two this is a big one
[50:38] how do you think your choice will impact
[50:41] you
[50:42] and those involved because i promise
[50:44] there's always those involved yes amen
[50:47] it's bigger than you all right
[50:49] number three do you think this is the
[50:52] most
[50:53] suitable choice i didn't not asking if
[50:55] you think it's a good choice
[50:56] i'm asking if you think it's the best
[50:59] the most suitable how do i know what's
[51:02] going to be the most suitable choice
[51:03] what what do you feel is god's will for
[51:05] your life if if choice a takes you away
[51:09] from this and choice b brings you closer
[51:12] to this the answer should be b
[51:16] amen
[51:18] question number four
[51:19] is that what you really want
[51:23] and then i i spoke about a fifth
[51:24] question that you know would you like uh
[51:27] to take time you know to to to think
[51:31] about uh your response because you know
[51:34] this this might be a a pretty big uh
[51:38] issue in your life and so
[51:41] so when i when i looked at these
[51:43] questions you know
[51:45] that
[51:47] i i i used actually in this pulpit
[51:51] i had a uh what i would call
[51:54] a certain
[51:56] well
[51:57] aimed
[51:58] um
[52:00] how would i say it better i
[52:02] it i i asked you questions
[52:05] the context of which were well aimed
[52:09] for this assembly
[52:11] now i've got plenty of people who watch
[52:14] from all over the world who aren't in
[52:15] this assembly that's fine well and good
[52:16] i preached along some of these lines at
[52:19] the men's meeting and it'll go to here
[52:21] in yawn that's that's fine that that's
[52:23] just because i've traveled the world
[52:24] preaching the gospel but but as a
[52:27] shepherd
[52:28] as a pastor
[52:30] i
[52:31] i felt like i wanted to ask and there's
[52:33] plenty of different contexts there's
[52:34] plenty of different contexts but i had a
[52:37] certain context
[52:38] based on my observation as a shepherd
[52:42] and the need that i sense
[52:44] for those under my responsibility does
[52:47] that make sense to you would you not
[52:49] want me to do it that way
[52:51] see
[52:52] and so
[52:53] so i used a certain context in the in
[52:56] the sermon last time
[52:57] but the questions are good questions
[52:59] they're good principled questions and
[53:02] they're usable uh broadly in many other
[53:05] contexts but i but last time what i was
[53:08] doing is i i i wanted to use my if i
[53:11] could say it like this i i was using my
[53:14] god-given
[53:16] high-powered scope to look downrange
[53:19] over the flock of god that he had
[53:22] committed to my care amen committed to
[53:25] my charge to form
[53:28] to inform my thinking to form my
[53:31] particular
[53:33] well-aimed questions to this assembly
[53:37] i used my spiritual laser range finder
[53:41] to make sure because
[53:44] i wanted to hit the target
[53:49] targets
[53:52] all right i had a target but i'm
[53:54] shooting at more than one target see
[53:57] and you know sometimes a well-placed
[54:00] shot
[54:01] oh my sometimes these things always have
[54:02] their humorous side sometimes a
[54:04] well-placed shot can be
[54:06] actually blown off course
[54:08] by an unexpected and sudden wind amen in
[54:12] our case it was a bug
[54:17] in our case it was a little one and a
[54:19] half inch creature
[54:20] that terrified three quarters of the
[54:22] church i'm glad i didn't see it
[54:26] because i just kept going along but
[54:29] sometimes an unexpected win can cross
[54:32] you downrange and you're you know you're
[54:35] uh
[54:36] you're you're most well-placed shot
[54:39] can miss can go awry because of an
[54:42] unexpected and sudden change that you
[54:44] weren't anticipating
[54:46] so i'm gonna fire my shots again
[54:50] amen
[54:52] now stand perfectly still please don't
[54:54] move
[54:55] because i want to hit the target
[54:58] amen
[55:01] we asked the question
[55:04] number one you know
[55:05] the number one question was have you
[55:07] thought carefully have you carefully
[55:09] thought this through the decisions that
[55:10] you are making or
[55:12] have made
[55:14] and i knew this morning friends i knew
[55:16] this morning studying this and i found i
[55:18] realized at least i believe to the best
[55:20] of my ability i realized why i was
[55:21] struggling so hard to find the exact
[55:24] path of god this morning because i was
[55:26] in my own desire wanting to turn this
[55:29] into a preaching sermon and the lord was
[55:31] determined that it was going to be a
[55:32] practical sermon so you okay with that
[55:35] so
[55:36] so i
[55:38] so my my long range
[55:40] my laser range finder my
[55:43] my law high powered scope that god has
[55:46] gifted me with to see
[55:49] and to determine and to make judgment
[55:51] and a gift to rightly divide the word
[55:54] and
[55:55] and it's it's not now i'm not the gift
[55:57] the gift is a piece of machinery inside
[55:59] of me it has not it's not me
[56:01] see
[56:02] it's that god called me to this office
[56:04] and put that machinery in me and it
[56:06] turns itself on
[56:08] all right
[56:10] so you should never take anything
[56:11] personally for me because it's not me
[56:13] it's coming through god's channel
[56:16] and so and i know that can be difficult
[56:18] especially if my flesh gets in the way
[56:20] and i make it sound personal and i
[56:22] that's always wrong that's never right
[56:25] but i here was here was my first shot
[56:28] downrange
[56:29] because here is here's a decision
[56:33] that too many
[56:34] in bethel tabernacle are making
[56:38] might make or have made
[56:41] i have work
[56:42] and school
[56:44] and hobbies and social friendships and
[56:48] social obligations and career
[56:50] obligations and i'll come to church when
[56:52] i can
[56:55] i'll get there when i can
[56:58] rule number one
[56:59] have you
[57:01] carefully
[57:02] thought this through come on amen
[57:06] now if you have okay
[57:07] it's not up to me to run your life but
[57:09] have i just want to make sure you've
[57:11] really thought that through amen see
[57:17] there's a brother in this assembly
[57:22] i'm not going to call his name first of
[57:23] all he wouldn't want me to
[57:27] he had quite a bit of years
[57:31] and money
[57:33] already invested
[57:35] in college
[57:37] and a career
[57:39] and a career and had that career with
[57:41] long-term security and great benefits
[57:45] and a growing family to think of but
[57:46] this question was on his mind
[57:51] this question was on his mind as he
[57:54] carefully thought it through
[57:57] his he realized that his career
[58:00] kept him too often
[58:02] from the house of the lord amen
[58:07] for him
[58:08] that was untenable
[58:11] at least long term
[58:13] short term things come up i get it
[58:14] sometimes short term life is life
[58:17] i get it god gets it too trust me
[58:19] all right
[58:21] but long term that was untenable for him
[58:25] he began some time ago
[58:27] asking the lord to give him something
[58:29] different
[58:31] i mean this means
[58:33] throwing away
[58:34] years
[58:35] and lots of dollars in college
[58:38] and a career
[58:44] he began asking the lord to give him
[58:46] something different
[58:48] the lord looked on that prayer
[58:51] and the desire of his heart
[58:54] the lord was so pleased with that
[58:56] that he arranged a completely
[59:00] completely
[59:02] new career opportunity
[59:05] and it turns out
[59:06] it's one that will actually end up
[59:08] paying him even more money
[59:13] best of all
[59:14] best of all
[59:15] it will allow him to be in church with
[59:18] his family when the doors are open amen
[59:23] say that's not that important to me okay
[59:26] okay
[59:27] okay
[59:28] you know
[59:30] good luck with that then carry on god
[59:33] bless you
[59:34] i'll still love you we'll still love you
[59:36] you got to make the best decision for
[59:37] you and your family i'm just asking you
[59:39] have you
[59:41] have you really have you carefully
[59:43] thought through
[59:45] that decision
[59:47] concerning
[59:48] attending the house of god when the
[59:50] doors are open amen
[59:52] this listen this is just brother jason
[59:55] asking you to think about it
[59:58] fair enough
[59:59] just asking you to think about it
[1:00:05] number two
[1:00:07] i'm an adult with my own family and i
[1:00:10] don't need ministers bawling me out and
[1:00:13] telling me what to do
[1:00:15] rule number two
[1:00:16] how do you think
[1:00:18] that decision will impact you
[1:00:21] and those
[1:00:22] that it will involve
[1:00:25] if you don't want the preacher telling
[1:00:27] you the truth if you don't want if you
[1:00:30] want to change the scripture to where
[1:00:32] the house of god is not the house of
[1:00:36] judgment
[1:00:37] that judgment begins at the house of god
[1:00:41] but you don't want that okay this is
[1:00:43] just brother jason asking you to think
[1:00:45] about that
[1:00:47] you know
[1:00:49] how do you think your decision
[1:00:52] will impact you
[1:00:54] and those that are going to that it's
[1:00:56] going to
[1:00:57] involve
[1:00:59] you know just just as
[1:01:01] just as you know all preachers get
[1:01:04] terribly misunderstood uh brother brown
[1:01:07] talked about how he was so misunderstood
[1:01:09] and all faithful ministers do brother
[1:01:11] branham said everybody thinks now
[1:01:13] there's a reason for that people weren't
[1:01:14] just being stupid he said everybody
[1:01:16] thinks i'm a he said all the people
[1:01:18] think i'm against everybody now there
[1:01:20] was a reason for that it's because of
[1:01:22] the way he ministered
[1:01:24] and he said but if they only knew i'm
[1:01:27] actually for everybody
[1:01:30] and he said but i have to be loyal to a
[1:01:32] message he said humanly speaking i wish
[1:01:35] it wasn't mine
[1:01:37] i can say to you today i wish this
[1:01:39] wasn't mine
[1:01:41] but it is
[1:01:43] so what would you have me do
[1:01:46] see
[1:01:47] and so
[1:01:49] you know i i if you haven't can i could
[1:01:51] i do a little promo here for
[1:01:54] last weekend brother jd's sermon
[1:01:56] oh my goodness
[1:02:00] wow say it backwards wow
[1:02:06] brother jd that may be the best sermon
[1:02:08] i've ever heard you minister goodness
[1:02:11] and you know it was so
[1:02:13] helpful
[1:02:14] that's what the word of god should be it
[1:02:16] should be helpful
[1:02:18] it should teach us how to how to serve
[1:02:21] god and how and and the purpose about of
[1:02:23] why we're here because i promise you
[1:02:26] oh brother jd you didn't get to hear all
[1:02:27] the bragging or were the speakers on
[1:02:29] okay good okay
[1:02:32] amen
[1:02:33] praise the lord just want to make sure
[1:02:35] that you got that rose pinned on you
[1:02:37] properly i know sister amy would have
[1:02:38] told you but i wanted you to hear it
[1:02:40] amen
[1:02:43] and you know
[1:02:45] one of the one of the parts among the
[1:02:47] many that just sent me into the
[1:02:49] stratosphere
[1:02:50] is brother jd talked about missing the
[1:02:52] mark now this is interesting
[1:02:55] and he didn't call it that but that
[1:02:56] that's that that's what he was referring
[1:02:58] to and i've got the scripture that he
[1:03:01] actually used you know
[1:03:03] sin
[1:03:04] because he identified what sin was
[1:03:07] and you know i have been
[1:03:09] i have been studying
[1:03:12] the writings of great scholars since i
[1:03:15] was a boy
[1:03:17] i have been studying this book since i
[1:03:20] was a boy
[1:03:23] and i'm here to tell you
[1:03:25] that i that i have heard that statement
[1:03:29] what is sin sin is missing the mark i
[1:03:32] could take you to my lexical aids
[1:03:35] by dr zodiates
[1:03:37] and and show you that's even what he
[1:03:39] calls it what is sin missing the mark
[1:03:43] but they never tell you what the mark is
[1:03:47] like it's just like a cliche it's like
[1:03:49] what is sin missing the mark oh that's
[1:03:51] pretty profound okay
[1:03:55] what's the mark
[1:03:57] i understand there's a mark i understand
[1:04:00] there's a prize
[1:04:01] i understand there's something depressed
[1:04:03] too what is it
[1:04:05] if you answer that you'll answer why
[1:04:07] you're here
[1:04:09] amen
[1:04:10] so what is sin
[1:04:12] brother jd quotes romans 3 23
[1:04:16] for all have sinned and come short of
[1:04:18] the glory of god what is sin you living
[1:04:22] in a way that misses the mark what's the
[1:04:24] mark for your life to look like his life
[1:04:27] for your life to bring him glory
[1:04:31] so that the world who's misunderstood
[1:04:33] him completely because of their teachers
[1:04:36] and misinterpreted theology
[1:04:38] the world is in a state of blindness
[1:04:42] that's the bible
[1:04:43] there's darkness on the world and gross
[1:04:45] darkness on the people and perilous
[1:04:47] times and there's a time like has never
[1:04:50] been and you've got pre-tribulation
[1:04:52] movements happening to us right now
[1:04:54] you've got the the reaper the sowers
[1:04:56] overtaking the reapers i mean i'm here
[1:04:58] to tell you something friends you're
[1:05:00] living in the most chaotic dark but yet
[1:05:02] the brightest most light that's ever
[1:05:05] struck the world and you have free
[1:05:07] access to it it's yours for the taking
[1:05:12] and what is its purpose
[1:05:14] so that your life
[1:05:16] can bring
[1:05:17] him
[1:05:18] glory
[1:05:20] that's why you're alive
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:25] the bible says
[1:05:28] the bible teaches us in what it says
[1:05:31] let everything that has breath praise
[1:05:33] the lord
[1:05:35] what is the lesson
[1:05:36] if your life if your breath doesn't
[1:05:39] praise him stop breathing
[1:05:42] because you're a thief you're using air
[1:05:44] you can't manufacture
[1:05:47] you understand you're filling your lungs
[1:05:49] with god's product
[1:05:51] but you're refusing to give him glory
[1:05:54] you have life flowing through your blood
[1:05:56] you couldn't put it there you can't keep
[1:05:58] it there
[1:06:00] and you're not using that life to bring
[1:06:03] him glory which is the purpose of why
[1:06:06] you have life
[1:06:08] oh man i get to spend the rest of my
[1:06:11] time on that point alone that's our
[1:06:13] purpose that's our purpose
[1:06:16] your life is not about you it's about
[1:06:18] him it's never been about you it's
[1:06:20] always been about him
[1:06:24] this is why we preach this is why
[1:06:27] the judgment begins at the house of god
[1:06:30] this is why
[1:06:34] you have to come here
[1:06:36] to have your mind washed clean
[1:06:39] how do you how does that happen
[1:06:41] by the washing of the water
[1:06:44] of the word
[1:06:46] the condition of the world today
[1:06:48] everything you contact from the tree of
[1:06:52] knowledge of good and evil contaminates
[1:06:54] your mind
[1:06:55] it contaminates your mind it
[1:06:57] contaminates your spouse's mind it
[1:06:59] contaminates your children's mind it
[1:07:01] contaminates whole churches whole
[1:07:02] families preachers everybody we need
[1:07:05] constantly
[1:07:06] not less we need more of the word to
[1:07:09] keep our minds washed
[1:07:12] how you going to make life decisions
[1:07:14] that affect you and your loved ones if
[1:07:16] you don't have a clean mind to make it
[1:07:18] with
[1:07:20] amen
[1:07:21] because you you've allowed
[1:07:24] career and college and school and social
[1:07:27] activities and social connections you've
[1:07:29] allowed
[1:07:30] you know these kinds of things to
[1:07:33] reprioritize your schedule so so that
[1:07:37] your prayer life and your church life
[1:07:39] and your bible time and your hearing a
[1:07:41] tape time and all these things that are
[1:07:43] designed and purposed to keep you strong
[1:07:45] and clean you you don't you never get to
[1:07:48] them
[1:07:48] they're they're you know what you know
[1:07:50] why a lot of times you don't get to them
[1:07:51] because they're only fitted and
[1:07:52] sometimes they don't fit
[1:07:56] because they're not they're not your
[1:07:58] main state they're just fit in
[1:08:00] you try you make time and then sometimes
[1:08:02] things happen life happens and you can't
[1:08:03] make time
[1:08:05] you see what i mean
[1:08:06] you see what i mean
[1:08:10] this is why you have life is for his
[1:08:12] glory i got i'm going to stop early i'm
[1:08:14] not going to stop early i'm going to
[1:08:15] stop on time today
[1:08:17] you just indulge me another 10 or 15
[1:08:18] minutes can i get it
[1:08:21] because i this is so vital say well you
[1:08:24] preached it last time but the bug
[1:08:27] okay
[1:08:28] we had a bug
[1:08:34] missing the mark
[1:08:38] i don't need to be more spiritual
[1:08:41] i can believe the message and still
[1:08:43] dress and live like modern nominal
[1:08:45] christians
[1:08:46] they're christians too well of course
[1:08:48] they are brother branham
[1:08:50] we we put that quote up or brother
[1:08:52] branham said they ascribe
[1:08:54] how was the how was the language
[1:08:56] uh
[1:08:57] they ascribed to the fine qualities
[1:09:00] if you can find that matty if you can
[1:09:01] find that real quick and put it up
[1:09:03] matthew
[1:09:04] my matthew yeah if you can find that put
[1:09:06] it up they ascribe
[1:09:08] to the fine qualities just do a search
[1:09:10] for fine qualities i'm sure you'll hit
[1:09:12] it it's in the church age book
[1:09:14] and because they ascribe to the fine
[1:09:16] qualities of jesus
[1:09:18] they
[1:09:19] they're they're they're they're
[1:09:21] identified as christian just like anyone
[1:09:24] who would ascribe to
[1:09:26] to muhammad would be a muslim
[1:09:30] you see amen just like anyone who would
[1:09:33] ascribe to
[1:09:35] atheists become an atheist that's their
[1:09:38] identity and but brother branham shows
[1:09:41] there's a big difference in being that
[1:09:44] kind of a christian and actually being
[1:09:46] born again
[1:09:48] see because
[1:09:49] because in it and it's really simple
[1:09:52] it's not a complicated topic
[1:09:55] here's here's the deal here's the
[1:09:56] history you ready
[1:09:58] all right
[1:10:00] in the early days of the christian
[1:10:03] church
[1:10:04] every church was a message church
[1:10:07] there's no such thing as as a not a
[1:10:10] message church not a christian church
[1:10:11] there's all kinds of churches to diana
[1:10:13] and astarte and all these kinds of
[1:10:15] things and temples
[1:10:16] but there was only one christian church
[1:10:18] and they all
[1:10:20] believed quoted from and observed paul's
[1:10:23] teachings
[1:10:24] because he was the messenger to that
[1:10:26] alpha church amen and even all the other
[1:10:29] apostles and prophets and ministers and
[1:10:31] pastors ascribed to his teaching amen
[1:10:34] here it is if you yeah thank you son
[1:10:36] appreciate that look
[1:10:38] ephesian
[1:10:39] age uh
[1:10:41] where'd you go
[1:10:42] you had it
[1:10:46] there it is yeah right there so go up
[1:10:49] just a little bit
[1:10:51] all right
[1:10:52] now why does god call these churches
[1:10:54] because he uses plural in the book of
[1:10:56] revelation go read your bible churches
[1:10:59] why does god call these churches his
[1:11:02] churches
[1:11:03] even though they are the false vine the
[1:11:06] truth of the matter is that they are
[1:11:08] christians
[1:11:09] but
[1:11:10] they are not christians of the spirit
[1:11:14] that means you're born again when you're
[1:11:15] a christian of the spirit
[1:11:18] they are christians of the flesh they
[1:11:20] are bearing the name
[1:11:22] in vain mark 7 teaches us that jesus
[1:11:26] said how be in vain do they worship me
[1:11:28] here's why
[1:11:29] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:11:32] of men but indeed brother branham goes
[1:11:33] on to say they are christians for what
[1:11:35] else could they be a is a
[1:11:36] mohammed and that is his religion no
[1:11:38] matter how he lives it's because he
[1:11:41] subscribes in theory to what the quran
[1:11:43] teaches in the same way as a christian
[1:11:46] as long as he subscribes to the fact
[1:11:48] that jesus is the son of god born of a
[1:11:50] virgin was crucified and died and rose
[1:11:52] that he is the savior of mankind etc
[1:11:56] in fact in the laodicean age there will
[1:11:58] be those who call themselves christians
[1:11:59] because they subscribe to the fine
[1:12:01] qualities of jesus
[1:12:04] while
[1:12:05] reserving to themselves the right to
[1:12:08] deny his deity
[1:12:12] deny his deity is not not just limited
[1:12:14] to denying that he was god in flesh
[1:12:17] but because as soon as you deny that
[1:12:19] then you deny the holy ghost because
[1:12:21] they're all the same and then then the
[1:12:22] holy ghost has no authority in your life
[1:12:24] because you don't you deny him authority
[1:12:27] see
[1:12:28] see
[1:12:30] so
[1:12:31] his deity christian science have done
[1:12:33] that already as well as multitudes who
[1:12:35] preach a social gospel he's a nominal
[1:12:37] christian and belongs to the church but
[1:12:39] he is not
[1:12:40] a true
[1:12:41] spiritual believer
[1:12:44] teenagers young people
[1:12:46] look at that i want you to know that
[1:12:49] i want you to know that because there's
[1:12:51] a lie being propagated a whole world
[1:12:54] over that anybody who just reads a
[1:12:55] sinner's prayer and says he was the son
[1:12:57] of god and died for my sins they're just
[1:12:59] automatically going to heaven
[1:13:01] and that's not
[1:13:02] true jesus said many shall say to me
[1:13:06] lord lord who will never enter in
[1:13:09] it's those that do the will of my father
[1:13:12] see
[1:13:13] and so i want you to understand that
[1:13:16] that's bible teaching brother branham
[1:13:18] didn't make that up brother jason didn't
[1:13:20] make that up
[1:13:22] the world is overspread in this kind of
[1:13:25] a flesh christian
[1:13:27] now many of them are very good people
[1:13:31] extremely
[1:13:32] fine people
[1:13:34] you have listen friends listen
[1:13:36] especially teenagers listen because i'm
[1:13:38] determined to have a generation that
[1:13:40] debunks that completely
[1:13:42] there that what you have is three kinds
[1:13:45] brother in one place called it three
[1:13:46] kinds of believers you have an actual
[1:13:48] real believer
[1:13:49] who's born again in the spirit of god
[1:13:50] past from death to life never come into
[1:13:52] the judgment
[1:13:53] you've been born again of the holy
[1:13:54] spirit
[1:13:55] then you've got you've got that believer
[1:13:57] you've also got make believers and
[1:13:59] you've got unbelievers
[1:14:02] now let me let me re re-describe it to
[1:14:05] you in a different way saying basically
[1:14:07] the same thing
[1:14:09] pre-tribulation
[1:14:12] now
[1:14:13] before the tribulation before the
[1:14:15] rapture
[1:14:16] you've got three kinds of christians in
[1:14:18] the world
[1:14:19] you've got those
[1:14:21] who are
[1:14:22] truly born again of the spirit of god
[1:14:25] you've got a remnant who the bible calls
[1:14:28] an unwise virgin now she is a virgin
[1:14:31] she's not the harlot daughter of
[1:14:33] revelation of book of revelation
[1:14:36] you don't put her there she's a virgin
[1:14:37] to christ
[1:14:38] she's not exactly born again she's she
[1:14:41] has received
[1:14:43] uh the effects of his holy ghost on her
[1:14:45] flesh and on her spirit remember your
[1:14:48] body
[1:14:49] spirit soul your triune being
[1:14:52] and that's why they have been justified
[1:14:55] of their past sins but they also are
[1:14:58] sanctified and that's why the king and
[1:15:01] matthew chapter 25 calls them righteous
[1:15:05] because they live righteous holy they're
[1:15:08] saints saints means sanctified
[1:15:11] they live a holy you meet them
[1:15:15] you meet them i i i just bought some of
[1:15:17] my girls my granddaughters i told them
[1:15:19] hey go on this website and papa i'll pay
[1:15:21] for your find you a nice skirt camp's
[1:15:23] coming up
[1:15:24] and it's a christian
[1:15:25] i mean if i pulled up their picture they
[1:15:27] sent me a nice email today i'm going to
[1:15:28] write them back my goodness such a
[1:15:30] beautiful family man woman the children
[1:15:33] wow and i just thought wow
[1:15:36] they
[1:15:37] i might need to witness to them
[1:15:39] and you say well what if they don't
[1:15:40] believe the message well that's just up
[1:15:42] to god you can't determine that that's a
[1:15:44] gene of god or it's not but that doesn't
[1:15:47] mean you might not tell them enough that
[1:15:48] they could save themselves in the
[1:15:50] tribulation by not taking the mark of
[1:15:52] the beast so you should witness to
[1:15:53] everybody
[1:15:54] because you don't know who is or who is
[1:15:56] it say well is there any way i can find
[1:15:58] out who is and who isn't sure if they
[1:16:00] have a gene of god and brother branham
[1:16:02] said the light ever flashes across that
[1:16:04] seed it'll come to life
[1:16:06] but if it's not there they won't see it
[1:16:08] and can never see it but that doesn't
[1:16:10] mean that those righteous saints go to
[1:16:12] hell they don't they go actually after
[1:16:15] the millennium they're granted eternal
[1:16:17] life
[1:16:18] and live with us in heaven
[1:16:20] so you've got the elect lady as john
[1:16:23] called her born again of the spirit of
[1:16:25] god you've got righteous christians who
[1:16:27] live sanctified lives
[1:16:30] and then you've got a third category of
[1:16:33] those who call themselves christians
[1:16:36] they have a form of godliness they call
[1:16:39] themselves christians that's a for they
[1:16:41] go to church they sing gospel songs they
[1:16:44] have a form of godliness but they deny
[1:16:47] the power brother madam said that's the
[1:16:49] living reality to change their lives
[1:16:53] see the the first three
[1:16:55] feasts are passover unleavened bread and
[1:16:58] first fruits we were dealing with this
[1:17:00] with the brothers yesterday and the
[1:17:01] breakfast the unleavened bread
[1:17:04] jesus was the passover lamb the next
[1:17:06] feast which started the very next day
[1:17:08] was unleavened bread it meant that all
[1:17:10] leaven is driven out of your life 11 is
[1:17:13] in the bible is sin paul teaches us that
[1:17:16] and so anybody who's a real christian
[1:17:18] drives sin out of their life you don't
[1:17:20] read a sinner's prayer
[1:17:24] i believe jesus the son of god died to
[1:17:25] save my sins and that's actually written
[1:17:26] out if you say it then praise the lord
[1:17:28] you're in the kingdom but if you really
[1:17:31] accept christ it drives sin out of your
[1:17:35] life you don't keep on going with no
[1:17:37] change
[1:17:39] you don't just take his name get
[1:17:41] baptized and the women keep dressing
[1:17:43] immorally and they even dress him early
[1:17:45] now going to church for goodness sake
[1:17:48] and the men keep smoking and drinking
[1:17:50] and cursing and and gambling and all
[1:17:52] these kinds of things and carousing
[1:17:53] that's not a christian it might be a
[1:17:55] christian of the flesh who goes to
[1:17:57] church that's not a real one
[1:18:00] that's an artificial one
[1:18:02] and you've got those three kinds
[1:18:05] see
[1:18:08] that little card that sinner's prayer
[1:18:10] there's nothing wrong with the wording i
[1:18:11] love the wording
[1:18:12] but what it's represented to be
[1:18:15] that's the big lie being told
[1:18:18] and we said yesterday brothers and i set
[1:18:20] nine of us seven and the tennis and two
[1:18:22] online and we'd had a discussion about
[1:18:24] how do we how do we expose this lie say
[1:18:28] what's the lie here's a lie
[1:18:29] denominationalism leads to the mark of
[1:18:31] the beast
[1:18:32] stay in it you're doomed
[1:18:35] it'll lead you to the mark
[1:18:37] there there's an image to the beast
[1:18:39] that's already built and will soon come
[1:18:41] into power say oh well we got a
[1:18:43] constitution so does canada
[1:18:45] but i there's a pastor right now who who
[1:18:49] kept his church open just during covert
[1:18:51] when the government said don't hold
[1:18:52] services he said that's house of god i'm
[1:18:53] gonna hold services and he held services
[1:18:55] and then he came to the u.s
[1:18:56] to preach some
[1:18:58] at a conference and when he went back as
[1:19:00] soon as he landed they took him off the
[1:19:01] plane in handcuffs and handcuffed him
[1:19:03] put him on his knees right on the tarmac
[1:19:04] with everybody watching
[1:19:06] and handcuffed him and since he's now
[1:19:08] facing six years in prison
[1:19:11] and he said you think this can't happen
[1:19:12] to you america trust me it can and it
[1:19:14] will
[1:19:16] see after the bride goes in the rapture
[1:19:20] those three kinds of different
[1:19:21] christians real ones sanctified ones and
[1:19:24] those who have a form of godliness but
[1:19:25] deny the power don't have any change in
[1:19:28] the life when the bride goes there's
[1:19:30] only two remaining
[1:19:32] and this one will be hunted down like
[1:19:34] dogs and killed and give their life in
[1:19:36] the tribulation but they'll be in heaven
[1:19:39] and the third category who denied his
[1:19:42] power never let him have rule and reign
[1:19:44] in their lives will go to a lake of fire
[1:19:46] by their own choice
[1:19:48] by their own choosing
[1:19:51] see
[1:19:52] say brother jason you've kind of talked
[1:19:54] about a lot of this
[1:19:55] and i've talked about it a lot recently
[1:19:58] because it is an abiding burden on my
[1:20:01] heart why brother jason because in my
[1:20:05] long-range scope i see too much of it
[1:20:09] in this group
[1:20:10] i see that lie
[1:20:12] being
[1:20:13] brushed under under a rug
[1:20:16] shouldn't we witness shouldn't we move
[1:20:18] among them absolutely
[1:20:21] that's why you're here
[1:20:23] but what message are you giving them if
[1:20:26] your life isn't bringing him glory
[1:20:30] what are you telling them in your life
[1:20:32] if you're dressing just as as as
[1:20:36] horrible as they are yeah amen
[1:20:39] if your church attendance is no better
[1:20:41] than theirs in some cases not even as
[1:20:42] good as some of theirs
[1:20:44] because for them it's a social gathering
[1:20:46] they wouldn't miss it
[1:20:48] see so what what is the message that
[1:20:52] you're giving to expose the lie amen
[1:20:57] amen
[1:21:00] i don't need to be more spiritual i can
[1:21:01] believe the message and still dress like
[1:21:03] and live like modern nominal christians
[1:21:05] do you think come on
[1:21:07] do you think introspection
[1:21:10] do you think that is the best choice you
[1:21:14] can make
[1:21:16] are you sure
[1:21:18] are you sure
[1:21:22] brother jason
[1:21:24] i'm young
[1:21:26] i've got my whole life ahead of me i
[1:21:28] just want to be free to live in sin
[1:21:31] is that
[1:21:32] what you really
[1:21:34] want
[1:21:36] is that what you really want
[1:21:43] i'm gonna look you all in the eye
[1:21:45] look me in the eye i want you to know
[1:21:47] something young and old alike
[1:21:50] there is no life value in sin
[1:21:56] zero
[1:21:59] it pays wages
[1:22:00] some people choose sin as a career
[1:22:02] become career centers
[1:22:05] it pays wages
[1:22:06] wages you can't refuse it's death
[1:22:09] the wages of sin is death
[1:22:13] there's plenty of physical
[1:22:15] pleasures in sin plenty of social
[1:22:18] pleasures in sin
[1:22:20] but no
[1:22:21] life value
[1:22:23] because it all
[1:22:25] comes to an end
[1:22:30] it all comes to a sad
[1:22:34] end
[1:22:36] my goal for me for my house and for you
[1:22:40] and your house is that we will serve the
[1:22:44] lord amen i have one goal
[1:22:47] for my house and my family my children
[1:22:51] my wife my grandchildren if the lord
[1:22:55] tarries their children
[1:22:57] i have one goal that overrides every
[1:23:00] other thing i have and that is that they
[1:23:03] will all be gathered with me on the
[1:23:05] other side
[1:23:07] i have that same goal for you
[1:23:09] and for your children and for your
[1:23:11] spouse and for your grandchildren that
[1:23:14] is why i preach that is why i labor with
[1:23:18] it that's why i stay with it that's why
[1:23:20] i think about it night and day
[1:23:24] is because i want all of you to be with
[1:23:26] me over there and i know that no matter
[1:23:29] how upset you might sometimes get
[1:23:32] and sometimes it's my fault for letting
[1:23:34] my flesh get in the way i own that but
[1:23:37] understand here's what i understand on
[1:23:39] the other side you'll thank me
[1:23:42] on the other side you'll put your arms
[1:23:44] around me you'll say brother jason thank
[1:23:46] you for telling us the truth
[1:23:48] thank you that you wouldn't let it go
