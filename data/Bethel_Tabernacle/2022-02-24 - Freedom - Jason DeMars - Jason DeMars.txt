hot in here tonight uh the ac went out just a little bit before service started and brothers are ac guys once here and the other one's doing the sound in the in the back now for the internet so we're unable to get it back on but by god's grace we'll we'll make it through and uh we'll overheat together right one for all and all for one we i overheat y'all gonna overheat with me so praise the lord i wanna speak tonight on the subject of freedom the last few weeks i've been dealing with a few different topics and kind of a few things are coming together and i want to look at what is freedom and um also looking at what satan offers to the world which is self-autonomy so just want to talk about that and define that a little bit the first scripture we have if you want to bring up that powerpoint for the jackson is in genesis chapter 3. and we're going to read one through five now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil amen let's pray gracious heavenly father we come before you and yet we ask that your holy spirit would just move amongst us tonight lord come upon your word by your spirit lord and and may it come and penetrate into our hearts father may it bring transforming power lord as it's brought forth lord help me to step myself out of the way lord help each one here lay the cares of the of the day and of life to the side and and come to you lord ready to receive pulling on the word we ask father in jesus christ's name amen god bless you can be seated i usually don't take my jacket off but i have no choice tonight so you're going to see there on that slide that i have the uh esv there so if you notice in your in the king james version um it says you shall be as gods that word there is just elohim okay that's the word that's translated in the the top verse for god knows for elohim knows in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth elohim it's not a plural word it's a singular of majesty so when when this is spoken here you will be like gods of course it's it's it's acknowledging that adam and eve are distinct from each other but the reality is satan's not offering them to be a part of a pantheon of gods he's offering he's telling them you'll be like god like elohim like the creator knowing good and evil right so what is satan offering them actually he's offering them to be under his lordship under his dominion that's what he's offering but he doesn't come out and say it that way because they of course would say well god created us we owe our honor to god so in order to get adam and eve under his dominion under his authority he offers them a ruse what's that ruse it's a very religious one it's not anti-god it's actually saying well god's actually withholding something from you and i'm gonna bring you the revelation i'm gonna bring you a new revelation here so that you'll have a greater understanding to know good and evil and you'll be just like god they already were like god right they were made in the image and likeness of god they couldn't get any more like god than they already were god created them god had a perp had a purpose for them and god wanted to wants to fulfill his purpose and his plan through them and if they stay in that condition they're actually living in freedom perfect freedom they're not they're not in under bondage they're not under a spirit of bondage they're actually free so what is satan offering them adam and eve he's offering them the ability to govern themselves not to do it the way god said to do it come and do this the way you would like to do it but the funny thing is it actually really isn't self-autonomy at all it it looks like that's what it is but that's not what it is at all he is injecting his word into the mind of adam or of eve and then ultimately to adam and then into the rest of the human race why so when they receive his word they come under his authority under his headship when you when you receive the word of god believe it except that you're under the headship of the word when you receive the word of the enemy whose headship are you under you're under the headship of the enemy uh next verse i want to look at satan deceived his own self isaiah 14 12 says how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven so that's the first sin i will pride pride he wanted to do what he wanted to do not what god had created him for can you imagine just think about it for a second once again what a deceiver the people that were god's vice regents on earth ruling in god's place on earth he takes him and says you're going to be more like god what did he do to himself he said the same thing to himself you're going to be more like god i will ascend into heaven you already were i will exalt my throne above the stars of god no he wasn't to do that i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north brother branham tells us we understand satan is not omniscient omnipotent omnipresent but brother branham says as far as authority he was co-equal with god that means authority does it doesn't mean satan was somehow co-god or some kind of thing no he had the the authority of god in him and it was operating through him and it just wasn't enough and he came to adam and eve with the same very same thing you have this position you have this place you're he's a son of god you're a daughter of god but i that's not enough god's withholding something there's more to it than that right and instead of submitting to what god wanted they went satan's way and again the the offer is self-autonomy you can the word autonomy means to govern yourself you admit you're a law unto yourself you make your own rules you make your own laws that's what satan wanted for himself and that's the offer that he makes to everyone verse 14 i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high well i mean he was co-equal with god i see the deception satan comes to us and tempts us and deceives us with things that we actually have and have in a better way because that was the very way he deceived his own self all right so what is what what is our world today think about that for a second our world today is self-governing it's autonomous look at the fruits of a world that is autonomous that's self-governing no they're not under the dominion of god they're not under they're under the dominion of satan and satan's offer was you can govern yourself you can make your own laws and that's exactly what the world is doing it's making their own laws and what's the result is it a happy place to be is it getting better all the time more technology we have man the more ascended we are as individuals and the more peaceful we are with one another and the better nations get along with each other right that's exactly what's happening on earth right now that's exactly what's not happening on earth right now that's the fruit of self governance that's the fruit of self autonomy do you is that what we want as individuals we don't want it as as members of a society we it doesn't it hasn't worked it doesn't work it's failed and it's continuing to fail and it's to the it's to the level of the whole world is in a place of crumbling and it's a mess and it's getting less and less happy the more connected we are through devices the higher rates of depression and suicide worldwide and this is the offer that satan is making to everyone i'm going to say he tries to make it to us as believers all the time but especially he makes it to young people who are going through adolescence who are going through a change in life who are coming to a place where now they need to move into a place of being more independent that's a process that takes place over time hormones kick in in our bodies and all of a sudden mom and dad are weirdos and don't know what they're talking about and but that's part of god's way of getting us to grow up and to go out and and become individuals that can be a part of the body of christ and can can be in connection personally with god himself and be useful in the hand of god uh in the body of christ but i think the thing that the devil does he knows that this time of adolescence is such a danger is such a a good time for him to work because there is an easy deception that takes place is i want independence from my parents satan says independence i'll get them you want to you want to be autonomous you want to be self-governing i have a great offer for you i have 100 offers for you to become self-governing and become autonomous but it isn't god's way god has never called a single person in the history of the earth to be autonomous he's called him to freedom and liberty and that's the that's the ruse that the devil has i want my freedoms you get to become a teenager i want my freedoms i want my liberty you're in bondage to sin if you don't have the holy ghost you're in bondage to sin what are you going to get liberty you're just going to get more bondage unless you surrender your life to the lord and you get the holy ghost you're living in bondage you're born with that condition until you get the holy ghost you stay in that condition so when you get to that time and if you don't have the holy ghost say i promise you satan is going to offer you you can now govern yourself you're getting older now take your own authority take your own place do what you want to do i want to ask you a question where in the world does that thinking come from does it come from god it certainly doesn't come from god it comes it's a it's a deception from the devil we are as christians we are all we're to always be under the leadership of the holy spirit we're to be led by him we're not to follow what we want to do don't get that out of your heads young people i want to do what i want to do what okay devil i'm not calling you a devil young person i'm calling that devil that's speaking to you a devil recognize it for what it is and don't give in but fight what does the devil say and what do we see everywhere follow your heart if you would just follow your heart everything would be fine oh my goodness what a what a nonsense you're born with a sinful nature if you follow your heart what are you going to do sin upon sin more and more and more sin but satan says decide for yourself go your own way go after your own heart then you'll find fulfillment when you do that you won't the people that have risen to the greatest heights of quote-unquote worldly fulfillment are extremely dissatisfied are using drugs and and alcohol to to drown out the pain that they have that's gnawing in their minds and in their hearts that's what satan offers that's the crown of satan is someone drowning out their pain with alcohol and drugs that's not that's not what god is calling us to young people that's not what god is god is offering you freedom freedom from captivity freedom from bondage to sin numbers 15 39 says and it shall be unto you for a fringe that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and that you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes after which you used to go a whoring my goodness the lord really cuts to the chase in that statement he says you're you're you're playing the prostitute against me you're committing adultery against me because you're going after your own heart and your own eyes we're not to do that as believers we there's one person that we follow and that's the lord jesus christ and we're to be led by the spirit not our own hearts not our own eyes proverbs 28 26 he that trusts in his own heart is a fool but whoso walketh wisely he shall be delivered if you walk in wisdom what is wisdom the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom that's the foundation of wisdom so if you want to have be wise that's where you start but if you trust your own heart god says you're an idiot you're a fool you can't we don't know the future we don't know what we don't even know what's going to happen tomorrow we don't know the results of of any choices that we make but we do know if we follow god he's going to be there for us he's going to provide for us we may go through growth go through many trials many difficulties but he'll deliver us out of them all so don't be a fool don't be an idiot don't trust in your own heart it's it's a huge mistake why is it a huge mistake familiar verse jeremiah 17 9 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it that's the condition that we're born with that's not just really bad people that's not adolf hitler that's just adolf hitler that's not me i'm good i'm by nature good you're just you're once again you're deceiving your own self your heart you're born with a condition of heart and it's a bad condition of heart it's called desperately wicked and the depths of our wickedness and our own sinfulness the bible says who can know it in other words it's it's it's so great and so we can stoop a human being can soup so far in evil that it's it's almost impossible to go to the depths of that and i believe this is the this is the satanic deception in every age we talk about satan's eden it's the most deceiving age that's absolutely true but satan's tactic is similar in every age and that's that is govern your own self you can be self autonomous you can make your own ways you can make up your own rules follow after your own heart after your own mind and everything will be fine do whatever you think will work satan wants to work in our minds that's the place that he's constantly planting thoughts planting ideas he does that whether you're born again or not he's always working to plant seeds in your mind because he wants he wants to deceive you and he wants to destroy your life and he wants you to use you to harm and manipulate other people we we have to recognize that that is where the devil works young people don't forget that satan is going to work on your mind and you have to have your you have to guard you have to have a guard up you can't just accept every thought that comes in your head you have to you have to judge it by the word is this a scriptural thought is this a right thing is this a right approach this is the right attitude satan will work in the mind to tell you to go after your own heart your own your own desires make up your own rules that's his first avenue that's where he starts at then what is he going to do he's going to take he he has a design for you that's your destruction that's your destruction so if you if you realize when satan has taken you in a certain way in a heart of rebellion there there is an end to that you know and there is there's a lot of different avenues satan will take you satan will take you he'll put put a friend i mean i have my own experience 18 years old i was going to high school and i i always had sports kind of to stop me from wanting to become ineligible by smoking marijuana or getting caught at a party so i never would go but then i quit i quit baseball my senior year in the springtime i started hanging out with some not very good kids let's just put it that way after school that weren't involved in sports before i would have been constantly playing baseball and involved in that and not getting in trouble but now i was able to have time to get in trouble and this one kid he's he told me i'm going to get you to smoke weed no no i'm not gonna but i kept hanging out with him i kept there and he kept chattering at me i'm gonna get you to drink i'm gonna get you to smoke weed no i ain't i'm not gonna do that i should have been like this guy's not my friend this guy this guy's trouble i'm never gonna be around this guy again instead i just kept hanging out with him because he was friends with another guy that i like that never was bothering me but i didn't realize the danger i was in and so after a month of this chattering at me finally i said sure i'll smoke some weed and did was doing that was partying and drinking going completely the wrong way but what did it start with it started with the decision to listen it started with the decision not to cut that nonsense off and that's how the devil works what does he have he's going to take you down a road he has a path for you and he wants to increase that path increase that path he's going to take you into all kinds of wrong directions whether it be you know when you go into that drug and partying scene maybe you're gonna next you'll be robbing places trying to stealing from people you'll be maybe defiling yourself sexually you know these are things sometimes satan even takes a more subtle approach he says well i can't get him by just offering him drugs he'll never do it so instead what i'm going to do is i'm going to offer him a pretty girl or a handsome boy but that one that doesn't believe the word of god might be might be a nominal christian but isn't it on fire for god we'll offer you that right because i know i can't deceive him if i can't go directly to drugs and alcohol and sex they'll never they grew up in church and their mom and dad are on them constantly and and watching them so i'm going to give them i'm going to give them something else i'm going to give them a girlfriend or i'm going to give them a boyfriend that doesn't believe or follow the word of god why because he wants to take you to the next level and then the next level and then the next level why because he doesn't want you to be a believer he doesn't want you to be living in surrender to the word of god he wants you to be a tool in his hands for destruction and death but he's he's subtle he's not going to he's not going to just throw the worst thing at you it's little by little by little by little but it starts in one place and that's that's the very the very foundation is do it your own way what did what did the devil come to jesus when he tempted him he said you're hungry you have you have a physical need now do what i tell you even if satan was right in the end of the day that jesus could speak and turn stones to bread that's absolutely true but jesus isn't going to do it the devil's way we're not to do it the devil's way we're not to follow the devil's program he didn't first come and say bow down and worship me he said first do this little thing my way then he said come and worship me that's just how the devil will work with you too he's not he's he knows demons follow you just like there's angels and camping about you to protect you that are assigned to you there's demons that follow you they watch you they manipulate you they mess with you and they plant thoughts in your mind and they try to create circumstances it's a war that we're in the middle of and we're just we're just walking along like nothing's happening everything's fine but there's a war over your soul you got to recognize young people all of us but young people i want to open your eyes there's a war going on over your soul and how does the war happen it's fought with words and where do those words get planted in silently in your mind and unless you're checking that with the word you're going to go down an avenue that you're not going to like that's not going to be good for you why don't you avoid that let's see here i'm gonna skip ahead a little bit no i'm not second corinthians 6 14 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement has the temple of god with idols for you are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them i'll be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty our separation from the world and from the devil here is connected to him being dwelling in us and be us being his sons and daughters his sons and daughters who have him dwelling in them separate themselves from the world don't get it out of the order he comes and dwells in us and as a result we become separated what is that sanctification we're set apart for god so that first verse that we grabbed there do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers so there this is like uh this is paul bringing a mystical interpretation of a scripture in the old testament so i'm going to grab that you shall not plow with an ox and an ass together so he's taking this verse and applying it spiritually to believers and unbelievers so an ox i guess would be a believer and a donkey would be an unbeliever so we're not supposed to plow together with unbelievers that doesn't mean we go out of the world and become monks what it means is we don't come into an equal fellowship what's an equal fellowship a business partnership is one thing another thing is a a relationship between a boy and a girl a man and a woman we keep those kinds of things separate even friendships are dangerous when you yoke together like this a friendship with an unbeliever is dangerous when you're yoked together like this let me let me tell a testimony my own experience when i was first saved man the lord changed my desires he changed my heart but there was a lot of things that i had in my life that needed to get cleansed off of me so i mean there was rap music there was drinking there was the friends that i had that were pushing me towards partying and drinking and so it was it was there was victory but then there was struggles and trials and difficulties by god's grace i never went back to smoking marijuana but i'd you know i would go because my i grew up with parents that would drink beer and wine every once in a while that were that are christians and so i thought well i can just do that well it wasn't working very well for me and so i needed to stop that but then i was struggling i remember going to a church service at a charismatic church and i was talking with my brother-in-law about this and these problems and the friends that were kind of dragging me down and and taking me backward in my walk with the lord and so he he just said well let's just pray and the lord will will help you and give you wisdom well the minister preached on this verse that night and he gave an exact um basically step by step this is how you apply this verse if you've you've just been changed the lord's transformed your life you need to be careful what friends that you're yoked together with and he said what you what you need to do is right now you're like this spiritually with those friends and they're just dragging you down to their level continually you need to change that situation to where you're leading spiritually in those friendships and it it was just a basically he he said make a confrontation with your friends do it in love but just say i want to be your friend. god has changed my life we've talked about it i'm different i have a different direction in my life and i want friends that help me in this direction of walking with christ and so i want you to be one of my friends that helps me in my walk with god so when it comes to parties and drinking and these things i don't want that in my life anymore so don't invite me and if someone invites me make sure don't let me go don't let me get involved in that and uh we can be friends we can continue to be friends but i need your help in that of course everybody said oh yeah absolutely i'll be your friend there's one person out of all those people that actually stayed in touch with me and helped me oh he you know he would say oh we're going everybody's going out to this oh yeah but i remember you not wanting to drink and and party and stuff so you better not go so it but it what what happened was okay i did lose friends i found out who my real friends were is actually what i did i found out who really cared about me and what i wanted in my life and so that one friend stuck by my side that's fine god provided other friends i had provide good godly friends friends that were on fire for the word of god and that just that atmosphere alone brought me just totally set me on a completely different trajectory in my life but you that that that changes it that friend now was not unequally yoke with me he wasn't dragging me down now it was he and i were friends but we weren't friends on the level that was putting me in a place of continual compromise and that's that's the dangerous place that happens with being unequally yoked together with unbelievers is now they're forcing you to compromise over and over and over and over and over again and you're sitting here oh man i don't want to do this what's going on and maybe you're frustrated with yourself and you keep going in the wrong direction it's because you're unequally yoked you've got to break that yoke i'm not saying you don't have to be friends we have we have to win people to christ but do it the right way you say well you know i want to get into relationships with them they'll be my girlfriend my boyfriend and then i'll win them to christ oh my do you know how ridiculous that is you know absurd that is that's like saying hey i'm gonna go and commit adultery with people with all kinds of peoples so that i can win them to christ i mean it's it's it's to that level of absurdity why is it absurd why is it why is it to that level of absurdity because you're you're basically saying i'm going to do evil so that good would come out of it that's not how it works you're not going to disobey god and say god bless me in my disobedience no you can win that you still win them to christ absolutely 100 that's true but you have to do it god's way and not your way your way it's just an excuse you don't really want to win them to christ you just want to be in that relationship that's what's most important to you that's the absolute and the ultimate to you if you want to win to christ then do it god's way which is come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing what communion has light with darkness you have to separate then when you come to that level of separation now you can speak to them and talk to them and tell them about the about christ but not being you don't come and be unequally yoked together with an unbeliever and say let's let's bring you to christ because that it don't at 99.9 of the time it doesn't work that way the reality is it goes the opposite direction is you get dragged down to be an unbeliever with them that's what usually happens i know there's exceptions to that but they're very rare and they're very few they're very far far between and ultimately it's playing with fire obey god first do what god wants and that's don't have an unbelieving boyfriend or girlfriend don't be on the same level exact same level with people that are unbelievers that they're influencing you to the world talk to them make it straight make it make your purpose known i mean i told my friends i want to win you to christ i want you to be exactly like me i want you to be changed like like i've been changed that's my purpose make your purpose known and then say let's go forward with that premise in our friendship otherwise you'll be dragged down it's just how it works yeah i mentioned this in reading that paul romans 3 8 says and not rather as we be slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say let us do evil that good may come whose damnation is just we don't violate the word of god in order to fulfill the word of god we just obey it and let god do it his way you know it's another way to put it is if you're disobeying the whole the god you can't say i'm being led by the spirit to disobey god it doesn't it doesn't follow you have to the holy spirit always directs you to be in the line and order of god's word satan wants you to have this great opportunity to govern yourself but he also knows he does that and he offers that to you what does he offer he offers freedom in many ways in i've seen in missionary work that people in oppressed countries they don't really want to come to christ because they want to be saved from their sins what they really want to experience is they want to go from being under an oppressive government where they can't do what they want to do to being free freedom in christ is what they want but their definition of freedom in christ is not freedom it's self autonomy it's i want to do what i want to do i want to be like the americans and drink smoke and commit adultery and still be a christian that's that's that's what this world is like that's what this worldly denominationalism is like but it's a deception it's not it's not transformation it's just changing it's just changing from one dead religion to another dead religion salvation is salvation from sin it's not just a new political affiliation so where are we at so satan not only offers something different than god so god is offering to us deliverance from captivity to be free satan is offering us self-autonomy to actually be under his control and dominion but god works differently as well satan works from the outside in god works from the inside out so brother branham says in abraham's cove covenant confirmed in the garden of eden the devil chose a part of a man and god chose a part god chose his heart the devil chose his intellects in looking at the unseen brother branham says when god made man he made him thus for he made him this little certain compartment in the man for his own throne his control tower god wants to lead man but man wants to lead himself therefore there is a war constantly the man wants to go after what he sees with his eyes that's where he's deceived that's where satan deceived eve by what she could see the fruit was pleasant to the eye but it was death to the soul so is it tonight god wants to lead man so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that man would be led by the spirit of god getting off on his own leading is what separated from his fellowship i think that's just so profound brother branham puts those two things together god's program is working by the heart to lead the man he changes his heart and then he leads them from that control tower to control everything else satan is working on the intellect from the outside in to deceive and therefore control body soul and spirit the man i put together this little thing forgive me for my terrible artwork and graphic design lack of graphic design skills but there's the devil he's saying be free be happy follow your own heart but his words are actually dripping with blood because the purpose of the words are your death and he's coming from the outside in he wants you to be governed by see feel taste smell in here that outside then secondarily he comes to the mind right there comes to the mind in order to control see taste feel smell in here and control the body he comes to the mind and when he ultimately does that then the man is governed if you can see in the middle by unbelief the soul is governed by unbelief so the soul is the control tower right the soul is the nature of the spirit so when satan gets control he comes at it with deception from the outside working in okay so he does that he does that to unbelievers but here's a believer someone who has faith someone has the holy holy spirit satan still comes from the outside to deceive he still comes from the body to the mind to control the mind if he can control the mind then faith just gets bottled up and put in a little a little corner so it really can't operate it's just under the control and dominion of satan and a believer can get to that place they never lose their salvation but but in their in their in their experience faith is so weak it's in a corner that they're completely under that control and when that happens the whole focus becomes self and what what the devil is putting on the outside in what is how does the devil work again it's it's self-autonomy it's pride he works by pride and he wants to get he wants to use that to create unbelief in us but somehow the grace of god comes and there's something inside of you that says not my will not my will not what i want but yours be done blessed be the name of the lord the devil will continue to do that but he's going to come against us but faith will rise up in the believer god god will deliver you know i've been in that i've been in those places of those times where you just feel so down you so feel so hurt you feel broken you feel faith is not operating barely at all it's there the devil can never take that away it's there but yet it's it's so weak and we've got how do we battle the devil remember it's a war right and what how is it fought by words by words most powerful force in the universe the devil will come against you with words i remember brother bannon says he's actually just a bluff he doesn't actually have power over the believer the only power he has over the believer is if he actually lets him have power so if we if we just took the sword and fought we would never get to that position in place where our faith is weak back in the corner but instead instead by self-centeredness we get so focused on ourself that we don't see out we don't see out i've been there faith can't operate when the focus is on self but the word of god will come to you i mean god loves us he's not going to leave us in that condition he's going to give us strength then we can experience real freedom you know that's what the lord has come to do got to keep moving otherwise i'll never get my point across and everybody will sit here and sweat all night second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature or a new creation old things are passed away behold all things are become new old things have completely passed away everything when you're born born of the spirit of god everything has become new you're completely changed you're a finished product and you're ready for the rapture well it's the truth all things are become new you are a new creation but there's a work that god is going to do and he has to start doing romans 12 1 i believe this is a huge part of our sanctification it's self-surrender we our victory comes when we surrender ourself to the will of the lord when our passion our desire our entire purpose is to be in the perfect will of god what happens god is cleaning us in this process he's changing us and when our when we're with one mind seeking that the devil will come in with thoughts and try to get you off of that try to do things your own way he constantly does it to me so i know he's doing it to you too so we just fight we just stand our ground and fight with the truth and as you grow in faith what happens the deception from the devil gets even better and guess what happens it challenges you and you get stronger and you get stronger and then you get stronger again but i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable reasonable service our whole body not just our soul not just our inner man but our whole being our bodies our inner man all of us we submit and surrender to the lord that's our self-surrender and he says that's our reasonable service we owe everything to him and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god so we are a new creature in christ when we're born of the spirit of god but there's a process that we have to go through there's a process of growth and transformation that we have to go through and it's definitely directly connected to our self-surrender before the lord the surrender of our will our purpose our plans to god's will so that we're simply every one of us we're simply a vessel that god can work through according to his purpose john 8 36 the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed to be free means to be liberated so the pharisees understood correctly when they saw when they heard this verse and they got offended and said we've never been in bondage to anyone we've never been in bondage to anyone so someone that is set free means they've been in bondage that's the condition we're born in in bondage to sin that's why we need a new to be a new creation that's why we need to be changed is because we're in bondage to sin i mean i i think this is not just theological ideas guys this is not just doctrine this is not just words on the page we those of you that have kids you understand this that you're that they're born in sin and shaped in iniquity we love them we think they're perfect little angels before they start walking and talking and but it's all our experience we're not by nature good our heart isn't by nature good we're by nature evil we're by nature wicked and we're in bondage to sin we're born under this corruption of this world and we need to be set free says this is the pharisees just before those verses they answer him we be abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how sayest though thou you shall be made free jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever commits sin is the servant of sin if you commit sin you're in bondage to sin you're in bondage to sin that is satan's program bondage to sin so when you're getting these thoughts of wanting to govern yourself and do it your own way what is that what is happening satan is trying to entrap you and keep you under bondage of sin don't go that direction don't be don't go that route bondage is the opposite of liberty you you think you have the illusion of freedom right we're born with this illusion that we have freedom but it's a delusion we aren't free we're we are captive you say i'm an american i'm free you're a captive to sin and you need to be set free and you can't set yourself free christ has to do it the son is the one that makes you free when you're seeking to do it your own way when you're seeking to govern yourself you're working under slavery you're actually an enslaved individual that's the reality if your heart is continually pushing you in that direction i want to do what i want to do i don't want to follow what my parents do i don't want to follow this direction i want to do it my own way just i'm a preacher told you right now you're under bondage to sin and you're actually enslaved to it no i'm not i'm free i'm okay go ahead find out the direction it'll take you you have to be set free by the power of god you have to be changed by the power of god you have to become you have to be liberated christ is the liberator you can't liberate yourself by making yourself further in bondage to sin well i just want to do what i want to do you just want to be further and further and further from god is what you're saying okay you you have that you have the freedom in under the the the constitution of the united states to be a captive to sin here go ahead but that's not freedom it's not freedom god's god's highest freedom is when we are fulfilling the purpose that god created us for god makes it so there's this direct connection to being in the middle of his will to being the most fulfilled we have an illusion that life is about being happy we want to be happy i just want those people to be happy happiness is fleeting happiness goes up and down and up and down the would you rather be happy or would you rather be feel fulfilled i think if you have any sense about you you would rather be fulfilled because that lasts whether you're happy or not and how do you feel fulfilled how do we get fulfilled in our lives by finding and walking in the purpose that god created you for when you are walking in god's perfect purpose that's the place where you experience the most freedom the most joy the most happiness the most peace outside of that outside of seeking and that's something that you seek after that's not something that you arrive at and just sit there that's something that you it says as many as our sitting in the presence of god or are sons of god no lead that's continual that's constant that never changes that never stops you will always be as long as you're alive in this dimension in this flesh it's necessary that you're following the leadership of the holy spirit that never stops and that never ends that's something that we're always aiming for and pushing for and and putting all of our efforts and strength in into is finding the mind of god walking in the mind of god and being sure that we're under his authority when we're in that place that's peace that's shalom that's fulfillment that's happiness happiness goes up and down sometimes you're sometimes you're happy sometimes you're sad sometimes there's tears sometimes there's tears of tears of sadness sometimes they're tears of joy and thankfulness that's all part of living in this sinful dead and dying world but there's there's coming a time if you're living in the liberty of the sons of god there's coming a time where he's going to wipe every tear away where there'll be no sorrow no sadness but if you're going to choose the devil's direction the devil's way that's not for you there's just continual tears waiting don't choose satan's way don't choose bondage to sin isn't it amazing that we want to fall that we want as we're growing as we're as we're as we're coming to the ages of maturity that we want to find our own way and that's that's fine in its own sense but really we don't want to find our own way we want to lose our own way you're looking at it the opposite direction i want to lose my own with all my heart i want to lose my own way i just want i want to be done with my own way i want to be done with my own thoughts i want to think god thoughts i want to be in the center of his will no matter what i don't want to follow my own ways my own ways make me frustrated and sad and upset god wants you to be free how can you be free you certainly can't do it by going after the nature that you have inside of you you have to do it by seeking after him with all your heart musicians if you'd come romans 8 15 for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father so again the spirit there's a spirit of bondage and this there's a spirit of sonship a placing as sun placing in sunship the spirit of bondage what does it lead to fear again i just re replace all of this bondage is seeking after your own heart bondage is seeking after your own desires that's bondage we're born that way but we haven't as christians we haven't received that spirit we've received the spirit of placing as sons and sons are what they're led by the spirit of god amen romans 8 21 because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god amen thank god we actually are walking in liberty now by the spirit of god by his transforming power we've been delivered already from the bondage of corruption though this flesh is still under the bondage of corruption but the inner man is changed is transformed is renewed and is walking in glorious liberty but what is what is satan's way what is satan's purpose it's to keep people in the bondage of corruption and what is his offering to you you and what do you get when you choose you you get satan you get satan's ways satan's purpose the ways of the world and it leads to death it leads to corruption amen let's stand up heavenly father we just come before you lord and we're so thankful for
