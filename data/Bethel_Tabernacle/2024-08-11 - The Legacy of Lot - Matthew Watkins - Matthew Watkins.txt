here with you this morning if you have your Bibles we'll turn to the book of uh Genesis chapter 19 turn there well we've uh been a lot of places in these last few weeks people said you've been preaching everywhere except here and so but it was our um it was our lot falling this morning to uh to minister and so we just have something upon our heart we just want to be able to share with you today amen good to have brother Jason back amen his family and uh tuned in to getting ready for this morning I just clicked on to the uh Sunday school and and I to be honest with you I had to turn it off after just a few seconds and not cuz I was offended but um brother Jason was just right down to said it just two comments and I clicked it off and said no I'm going to just wa let the Lord do what he wants to do let him speak what he wants to speak and so we uh we just have something if you didn't hear that I I can I can tell just from that few minute that I listened to it it was really good so amen we want to be remembering our pastor in prayer who's way ministering actually for sister Amy's father brother da there in the church through in Minnesota I believe he spoke Friday uh also don't know if he spoke last night speaking today so amen do you love the Lord Jesus amen if you let's turn to Genesis chapter 19 we'll just begin reading I'm going to minister something the lord gave me this many months ago and um and I just wrote a title and if you ever go into my Google Docs you'll see just a bunch of those just one line that's all I've got is just one title and I just hold it there and let the Lord wait to to uh you know let it ruminate and give me inspiration to preach it and so I did that maybe 8 nine months ago and then I had prepared something uh you know for weeks now I'd prepared knowing that when I spoke here I would speak on uh another part to the Supreme token and actually had prepared that had all my notes laid out and then this morning the Lord just completely uh changed that and just flooded me with inspiration for this sermon I'm going to preach today so do you believe that the Lord Jesus still speaks how many believe that how many would say Lord speak to my heart today amen he can use the instrumentality of of men I'm just like you I got plenty of mistakes and failures and feel more unworthy uh you know to to be up here but I just want to yield my vessel now and let the Lord use me I know he has something he wants to say amen I want to preach to you this morning if they can uh just have my slides ready my title is the legacy of lot the legacy of lot just Genesis 19:1 and there came two angels to Sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of Sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face towards the ground and he said behold now my lords turn in I pray you into your servant's house and T all night and wash your feet and you shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said nay but we will abide in in the street all night and he pressed upon them greatly and they turned unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of Sodom Compass the house round both old and young and all the people from every quarter notice how the the extent to this condition the Bible takes time to point out it was not just the youth but also the elderly the entire the def that that the disease had spread throughout the whole tribe the whole city there and it says here in verse four but before they lay down let's read verse 5 and they called unto lot and said unto him where are the men which came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know them and lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after him I want you to notice his words because it'll give you an indication of his spiritual condition notice what he calls them and said I pray you Brethren imagine that that he's so closely connected with the community that he's calling these men Brethren verse eight behold now I have two daughters which have not known man let me I pray you bring them out unto you and do you to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof and they said stand back and they said again this one fellow came into sojourn and he will needs be a judge now we will deal worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and came near to break the door but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the house to them and shut the door and they smoked the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door we can just keep reading but I just to save time I want you to turn over to Luke chapter 17 really familiar scripture Luke chapter 17 we got just a uh just a sobering passage there and then the second one is sobering also amen but don't get all droy and Dr drowsy on me and blue this morning amen we're going to we're going to show you that the legacy of lot is not our Legacy amen Luke chapter 17 and let's just begin reading here very familiar scripture let's just begin reading here at verse 26 I'm sorry verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot so Jesus points back to this as an indication of where we live today they did eat they Dr drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now we know the prophet of God links this and we know it's linked to the ministry of the son of man that would come in the end time remember it was at even the angels came and in the end time the son of man would be revealed and notice he points to that as a marker and says in verse 31 in that day he that W he which shall be upon the Housetop and his stuff in his house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back and then he inserts this one verse I want to draw emphasis from remember Lot's wife remember Lot's wife Lord Jesus Lord how we love you with all of our hearts God how we need you Lord I just pray right now father in the midst of this audience as I stand Lord both numbered here and those that are maybe listen live or later Lord I pray God that you would just let us pull up a chair to your table this morning God and may we feed Lord from your word truly Lord Jesus this is what we are hungry for it's what we're thirsty for Lord I pray God that you would feed your children Lord I just want to submit myself and surrender myself to you right now Lord God I pray that you would use Lord the gift you've placed in my life Lord and may I not stray Lord in my own thoughts but may God I just be centered and focused just a tool Lord we ask it in Jesus name bless our pastor those traveling Lord my dad I pray that you'd be as Lord as portion today God give him strength Lord and return him or safely to us we ask in Jesus name amen you can be seated this this morning you can just display my slide if you have that brother Mark you can go ahead and just display that and I'll have this here the legacy of lot I thought long and hard about this as the Lord just begin to deal with my mind on this uh sermon and I thought it was such a contrast between the life and the legacy of Abraham and the life and the legacy of this man his nephew lot we'll take just a moment just to lay some Foundation I know that you're familiar with the story but uh just to make good Bible teaching here to to to show you where we're at with this we'll just take just a moment to talk about this man lot we know that lot was the grandson of Tara and the the son of heran who died actually in Earth we know that he was also the nephew making him the nephew lot making him the nephew of Abraham and he was born also o in the same place that Abraham was born in lot's father suddenly dies and this is his dad I don't know much about his dad because the Bible doesn't say much about him but we know that they both lived in this city of ER and we know the Bible records that that he dies that his father haran if I'm saying that right dies and so lot was taken as like an adopted son and brother brandham calls him that that Abraham being that this was his family Abraham had a love for him like a son and we know that lot is there living now without a dad and I don't know his history and you know I just want to be very careful and and and go slow here just at the moment because you don't I I don't want to portray lot in a way that that the word didn't portray him and I want to make sure I do justice to what we know about him because I don't know his whole history and you know many times s it's the it's the it's the Legacy that was not left by the previous generation that the next one doesn't have a chance and so we we don't know about we know that ER was a a place of uh you know it was Mesopotamia where Abraham lived if you ever look that up on the map you'll find where the Garden of Eden was the Bible tells us that there was three rivers and out of that was The Tigress the Nile and the Euphrates River you can actually still see that tigress and the Euphrates there today if you just look at a modern map and if you ever notice the land that splits the two rivers is actually the land of Mesopotamia meso means between potamia the rivers and so Abraham came from between the two rivers that's what it means there that this was the place we know that further this is where Babylon is established and so it would have to been a very evil place that that he's living in that's why God calls him out of that place you know I want to I want to give you a scripture in the book of Isaiah that I read this morning and I never had called it before I thought it was so powerful that Isaiah points back to the faith of Abraham and it says from when Abraham and his descendants God pulled them from the pit and I thought that was so powerful because many times we make Abraham to be this great God chose him because of some Faith No Abraham was just another man in a pit that God had mercy upon and so any Jew looking back to the faith of Abraham and Paul points to him in Hebrews Jesus mentions him and we know that that it was Abraham's Faith this was not a good righteous man not a man who was different than the you know was somehow better than the rest of society but somehow God showed Sovereign Grace and pulled him out of the pit and so God takes him out of the land of of of his fathers we know the story in the test of Abraham as he goes through and the Bible says he left there he he obeyed the voice of God he left that land and and and and he takes lot with him we know that story very well and at some point you know here lot's grandfather uh you know Tara decides to relocate his entire family to Canaan but they ended up settling in haran instead and at T after Tara's death the Lord comes to Abraham and he's Abram we know at that time and he speaks to him and he tells him you know that I'm going to make you we know this is in Genesis I think it's chapter 21 or chapter uh 12 and he and he tells them I'll make of thee a great nation and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed and that's all Abraham had to go Abraham had to go on he just had a promise from the Lord and he left everything he he he immediately in fact if you go look up that Hebrew word there when the Bible says he he he he left it means that he instantly he didn't question it he immediately left everything that he known he immediately left everything that he had been raised and and and and and and just left his entire family left his Heritage left his his history and and he just goes and he's so joury I think this is so amazing because all he had to go on was just the word of the voice that spoke to him God didn't show him anything more than that get up and go and God waits for obedience and Abraham the Bible says doesn't question it he just obeys the voice of the Lord and so he sets out on his journey and we know the Bible tells us how that lot goes with him forgive me let me set that's just here for a moment thank you felt [Laughter] that and so we know that that lot goes with him and we know that that here comes the story of how they come to bethl I think it was bethl and the Sheep's herder lot's sheep's herders and Abraham's uh sheep herders begin to argue and quarrel over the land and and and and you know and that there wasn't enough land to support two families and two tribes and the amount of sheep that they had apparently and so the Bible says that he gives Abraham gives an offer to lot and just says you know I we we're going to have to separate now this was all directed by the Holy Spirit was all directed by the Lord because Abraham was going to face many tests in his life he was going to before he inherited the promise he was going to come to many Crossroads in his life he was going to come to many decisions in his life and he was going to have to make the right choice he didn't realize it but he was leaving behind a legacy you know I thought about this word legacy and and and actually sorry for blanking that actually this word legacy this is actually what it means so powerful a legacy is actually portrayed as the impact I love that word and The Inheritance that one leaves behind it's portrayed as the impact and the inheritance that he leaves behind let me give you something the Lord just gave me this morning I thought it was so good that a legacy is not a resume because there's a worldly version or a worldly teaching of legacy and many times it surrounds money and what kind of livelihood you leave your family and how much wealth that you leave your family you actually find in the Bible that the Bible goes directly actually against that almost entirely when we think of Legacy the first thing we think of is money or maybe land or a house or property that's left behind and and and it becomes a you know the all important all consuming thing of as you get older what are you leaving that's not saying that that's not important friends I'm not not at all don't misunderstand me uh but but it but because even in the Bible this was important to them also but they didn't have much these were tent dwellers this brother brandham calls them dirt dobers the the the the Abraham's Seth's seed was never popular Rich famous but that was actually the seedline of Cain that was Builders of great cities but Seth's line was they they were vagabonds they were tent dwellers they were they were sojourners they were pilgrims they were just journeying they were just passing through the they understood that life was just a vapor they understood that you're here today and you're going tomorrow and and so that that was his seedline his legacy was after uh a a a after the the even the sons the Bible talks about the inheritance that he leaves first it would come to the sons and if there were no Sons it'd go to the daughters and then the brothers and then the uncles and finally whoever it was the closest relative would receive the inheritance left behind behind and so God's sign even in Proverbs the Bible speaks of this and it tells talks about uh uh being able to leave uh your children uh an inheritance was actually a sign of blessing this is what Proverbs 13 teaches and I'm just skipping a lot of my notes here to save time but there was also a sense uh that that that there was also a clear teaching in the Bible that actually the best Legacy that that a man could leave behind is the testimony of the life of his children blessed is the man who you know who you know whose quiver is full the Bible speaks of for they shall defend him at the gate and so you know that that teaching was that those children if there was an accusation against the father he would actually come to the gate and not have to open his mouth to defend the accusation because his children had the testimony of their father and they defended him think about Jesus he don't have to open his mouth to defend himself because his children speak for him with their lives they speak about the testimony that's why the prophet of God said as long as there's a Believer who will say Amen to the word of God it proves that Jesus is still alive think about that and so it was actually the the greatest sign or that you could leave was actually to your children and and so it was actually Pro you'd look at like property and and land and homes and and things like this but the Bible even the teacher of here's ecclesiast we know Solomon you know talks about he's talk about how that you work hard and you to make money and that might be passed down and Solomon says to a fool and then he squanders that and then what Legacy is that something that moths the you know just as Jesus said don't lay yourself Treasures in Earth where moths and rust do doth corrupt but lay your Treasures in Heaven Proverbs talks about wisdom I don't want to get sidetracked here so just bear with me here for a moment but it talks about wisdom being more precious in PSAL Proverbs 3:15 that that that that wisdom is more precious than rubies and to walk in the ways of righteousness and and in the paths of justice that that that bestows a rich and inheritance on The Descendants after him uh even the psalm David says here how important is to pass the knowledge and you know the scripture in Psalms chapter 78 and I'm just recalling it by memory but s David says we will not hide these things from our children but will tell to the Next Generation the praiseworthy Deeds of God and David begins to list the mighty works that God did and how that they came out of the Red Sea and and God made him the waters to stand up as a heap and and he was drank out of the rocky cck in the desert and how that Shadrach and meach and abedo was delivered in Daniel's F in the story of Daniel something greatest Legacy that you can leave behind it's good to leave Earthly wisdom it's good to leave Earthly knowledge it's good to teach them good things about life and and business and success and and not to be lazy and to be hard workers I believe in all of that friends but the greatest treasure you can leave them is the wisdom of this [Applause] word and and Jesus says this in Matthew 6 we just quoted it and says that that that talks about how how how uh uh worthless Earthly treasure is and he talks about to not store up yourself Treasures on Earth do we believe this but store up for yourself Treasures in Heaven where moths and and and Vermin do not destroy it where thieves do not break in and steal it and so we know that this Legacy the leaving behind a legacy and you know I just want to say this because the Holy Spirit reminds me as he did before I came out and I want to make sure I say this because not always do the children follow in the Legacy Godly Legacy Left Behind for the from the father and so so we know we can see that we can show you that in the Bible in many places how they there was Godly legacies left that children squandered later right and so don't I just say that because don't ever look at a family and say bye what kind of Legacy look at their children friends that's not always the case just because you're left a Godly Heritage or left good wisdom in the teaching of the word of God doesn't mean that those children won't squander that Legacy hello and so we think of this because it's so powerful that this was the Legacy this was this is what the Bible teaches and we we we read this definition that the legacy is portrayed as the impact and The Inheritance that one leaves behind it's the it's the impact or the Legacy let me just go back to what I was saying here earlier a legacy is not a resume of accomplishments it's not a list of how much money you left in the bank when you breathed your last breath it's not the all of the worldly Acquisitions or the great business that you it's not a legacy according to the Bible but a legacy is the imprint you leave on the future it's an imprint or as this definition says it so well an impact that you leave think about the Legacy that Abraham was building and he never even realized it think about that friends he never even realized that his name would be mention in Hebrews chapter 12 when it begins to list the heroes of the faith and you think about Abraham as he's he leaves everything he knows he comes to many test in his life and God says just leave it Abraham and then God you know his father dies and and God says you can't stay here uh crying and weeping over over what you've lost you've got to get up Abraham you got to keep going you can't stop you can't you can't let anything stop you Abraham you can't let your you can't let sorrow stop you then he comes to the story of where he has to separate himself and he tells lot you know you you you choose choose what you I whatever you take I'll take the opposite and the Bible says that lot looking at the well-watered pl Plains chose to pitch his tent towards Sodom but Abraham also made a choice oh come on somebody Abraham also made a hard choice to pitch his tent away from Sodom you think about this scripture in Hebrews chap 12 and it says wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses that great cloud of witnesses he goes on to tell about this man named Abraham I thought about this because Abraham walked by faith and not by sight he wasn't going based upon what he felt he wasn't going based upon Intel or knowledge that he had received he was going based upon faith in a promise in a word given by God and that's all he had and that's all that he needed and and I just thought about that this morning I thought that that that is so perfectly fitting or typing the life of a True Believer that we live our daily lives by the invisible things that we can't touch amen think about that just for a moment friends do you realize you've based your entire life of things you can't see a Christian bases his life not on what he knows or understands or even feels but let me just say this you've never seen God with your eyes you you say well I've seen the pillar of fire you might seen as anointing or you know or or something like that but the Bible says no man have seen him and so you've never seen God yet how many Believers of God do we have here today you've never seen him you've never even you've never seen you've heard about Jesus you've you've you you've lived your life reading the stories of Jesus of Nazareth but you've never seen him let me just go further you've never been to heaven you've never been there but yet you're going there yet you're living your daily life all for a place you've never been you've never you've never you've never uh seen anyone individual from Heaven yet you know that there's people there waiting just beyond the Riven Veil you've never seen it you've never even seen a many of us here have never seen a rich manuscripts of the of the Bible and yet you believe in it today you say brother Matt why because I have contacted something from that place and I've received just a down payment just a down payment and that's enough to make me forsake everything in this world and it makes me forsake everything that I want it makes me forsake all my dreams it makes me forsake all my plans why brother Matt because you've been there no I've never been there but there's something in my heart there's a seed of faith that says I know that it's more real than what I see here today you've never seen uh we talk about the grace of God the mercy of God yet yet they're not tangible think about that just for a moment nothing of what you're living your life for do you have physical evidence for and yet you people are living all the days of your life according to this shows you the power of faith it was Abraham who left everything brother bam says here in Jehovah Gyra as we go just a little further we find that Abraham had separated himself from lot I want you to notice the Christian Act Abraham he said lot you take the choice lot being backsliding in his heart he took the well-watered plains of Sodom and Gomorrah but Abraham took the poor desolate Barren ground what was it inside of lot brother Bon begins to give us just some some insight into the condition of his family we know that the prophet of God types him with that backslid and lukewarm believer he preaches a message called escap and come hither thither and he talks about how that lot was a famous man in that City you think about this as from the very beginning he sets his eyes towards the city of Sodom now remember a few things about lot because I I got to disc cover these just here for a moment remember that lot the Bible calls a righteous man and and you can go pick this up even if you look at his life in in Genesis 19 and the Bible calls him in second Peter chapter 2 verse 7 the Apostle Peter describes lot as being just just in other words he he he had an experience with the Lord in his life he was just and even calls him righteous yet he chooses to live his life in a backsliding city Wicked City like Sodom most of us think you know today and when we think of cities like Sodom and we think of of of LA or we think of San Francisco go and cities that would be like Sodom I tell you what friends it's about that way about every city you go to today it's spread from C to see but let me just say it's easy to look at a city it's easy to look at a backslid and people but actually to find Sodom you only need to look at your heart because the Bible says that the heart is deceitful above all else it's wicked how many believe that here today and so even despite all of this God calls this man lot righteous yet way deep below all of the external layers of what everyone's seen from his confession from maybe the way he comes out of her and he's there with Abraham he looks like a Believer he dresses like a Believer he talks like a Believer he knows the message he quotes the message and and we spoke on this before I'll just I'll just repeat it here for a moment that it never ceases to amaze me when you watch that that that that judge the Bible speaks of that when the judge died and you watch how that the people the family love the Lord serve the Lord believe the Lord live the message I've watched it live the message as far as from an external outside appearance that have all the layers that would look like Believers yet if you were to peel back all the those layers what you'd find is you'd find what was in lot that lot had a string to Sodom that he couldn't break he had lifestyle it was it was a it was a deep spiritual problem Oh I Feel the unction of the Holy Spirit right now it was a deep rooted something beyond the layers of what you could see outside and you watch behind because when you peel back all the layers and you watch what a person is really anchored to all you got to do is remove that anchor that Dad that Grandpa that Grandma that church that father who believed the word stood for the word kept those children straight but watch when that Ministry or that testimony either goes errant and backslides and if their faith was only anchored to the man they'll backslide with that man prophet of God says when I leave the word you leave me let me just say this friends if I ever leave this word you leave me I believe any true god-called Minister would say that and you notice when they when that person dies are gone then suddenly like a boat floating on the tide that Anchor's pulled up and then slowly you don't notice it at first maybe but it's drifting further and further and further and then before you know it what happened what happened to lot behind all of the layers there was a deep rooted spiritual problem he was bound by an unseen cord his heart the Bible says he seen the well-watered plains he seen the city of Sodom and that City somehow took Talons and planted in his heart lot though he was righteous brother bam picks it up and says oh the sins of that City vexed his righteous Soul he said brother mat then why didn't he come out he had a chance he had many chances to come out in fact the the Bible records the story of lot and his family being taken captives by the Kings the five Kings you remember that story of Abraham and lot in his entire family is taken captive and and what is it it's God it's the grace of God it's the mercy of God trying to shake him and his entire his entire family is taken captive says Abraham armed an army and goes and and Slaughters the Kings and rescues him see brother the mat why are you preaching on that because I just want to show you that despite a powerful Supernatural experience even being delivered yet he still went back to Sodom he couldn't break loose the Bible says in 2 Peter 2:8 for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful Deeds the prophet of God says it vexed his righteous soul but he didn't have the backbone to speak out against it another place he said he didn't have the playing downright gumption think we need some gumption about us friends I believe in how many would just want to say Lord in the wishy-washy World let me have some gumption about me he he couldn't he couldn't break loose from it lot knew better than to stay there he knew the scriptures of Psalms blessed is the Bible says is he that walketh not in the way the counsel of the ungodly nor sth in the seat of the scornful lot should have said at that moment this is my chance this is my Deliverance but yet somehow he couldn't break free he didn't have the plain gumption God gave him opportunity to leave listen God will never leave us without an opportunity friends to get out of this place God gave him opportunities to leave he gave him a chance to leave we just told the story he's attacked and he's taken captive oh but he he couldn't break free you say well lot never had a Bible Sodom had no Bible That's Right lot had no pre what what chance did his children have there was no Bible in those schools what chance did his family have there was there was no scripture being read there was no sermon being preached you're right in Sodom but I tell you what Abraham was his life was a sermon being preached to lot every day of his life and sometimes the only sermon that they'll hear is the sermon You Preach with your testimony I say oh God give us a testimony Lord not a compromising how many want that not a compromising Spirit but let them see my life the Bible says that the sins I I just focused there for a moment vexed his righteous soul and because he could never take a stand against it say brother Matt what was he do you believe he was he was a I do I don't I I I believe with all my heart as the Bible says and brother bam says he was a Believer he believed the word he I have no doubt he respected Abraham this is a family M of his I have no doubt but you say brother Matt what happened to him I tell you what happened to that man that man had be so unaware or asleep to the war that was raging and friends let me just stop here for a moment and just say that we can become so unaware that the battle never stops the battle never stops I I and and in a moment let me just say it is it is so staggering to me in a how quickly we can go from the the season of Revival and faith and victory to the season of carnal and cold and backslid it can we be honest people here today listen friends we're in a battle we're in a war the brother bandam said in greatest battle ever fault that the greatest battle was being waged right now in the mind and there's it's always been about a war it started in heaven that battle started in heaven in a Heavenly Dimension you know that there's three battles the prophet tells us there's three battles one that started in heaven and then that battle that Heavenly battle became an Earthly battle and it's now the battle of the human mind and one day it will leave the battle of the human mind and it will it will spill over into the battle of Armageddon that battle of Armageddon will only be the physical Battle of those demonic forces that you say are they just suddenly going to appear no brother they're just suddenly going to take on flesh because right now they're in the fourth dimension whether you can see them hear them touch them they are making the minds of people go crazy you don't don't ever forget that this is a real spiritual war it's a real spiritual battle the same battle that happen in in heaven and my Bible says that when Satan wored in heaven God cast him out of Heaven oh and I could hear the prophet say if he cast him out of Heaven what will he do to you when the Devil Comes attacking you and your home and your mind you say what do I do brother Matt cast him out of your house cast him out of your heart cast him out of your mind cast him out of your family he's a squatter he's just a bluff the prophet of God tells us in the Feast of the trumpets those 200 million demons that were held at the river Euphrates and the Bible says that they were held in Revelations it says that they were held for a certain year and a certain month you'll read it at a certain day at a certain hour at a certain moment just like Jude says they were reserved Fallen Angels reserved they were reserved in other words they were held back you say brother Matt what were those 200 imagine that picture here for a moment 200 million demons waiting on the edge of the bank of the river but that river that flowed from Eden stopped them from Crossing and brother bandam says those demon Spirits wanted so bad to go over when you go over the river of Euphrates you know where you be in the land of Judea the land of Israel and the prophet said what did those 200 million demons want to do they wanted to cross that River to destroy the Jews he's always hated the Jews you say why does he hate the Jews brother Matt is it their dress coat is it the long locks that the asdic Jew has is it the Hebrew language I tell you what brother it's not their language it's not their dress code the reason he hates them is because God loves them and Satan ha that's why the devil hates you and attacks you in your home and your family and say why am I under such an onslaught because God loves you oh that ought to make you shout this morning the devil can't touch me until my God gives him permission to touch me and the prophet says they wanted to cross that River of Euphrates but they were held back they were they were restrained they couldn't cross my brother says oh but at the opening of that those Seven Seals what did those Seven Seals unlock the prophet of God said those seals to Gentiles were the trumpets to the Jews and under that six TR under that Sixth Seal when that tribulation seal was broken but the prophet of God says when that trumpet sounded it was a freedom call not to Angels but to Demons to rush over that r River and the prophet of God says those 4200 million 200 million oh I say all my notes but I just want to preach it do you realize that the angel the armies of Satan have a number but the Bible says the angels of God don't have a number Hallelujah in other words the armies of God are innumerable they're surrounding you at all times and brother brandom says that those demon chargers at that six trumpet which is under that six seal say brother Matt we're not in the six seal that's your tribulation that's right but if you go listen to the Feast of trumpets brother bam tells you that under that breaking of that seal he says that they're released an amateur tribulation a pre-tribulation anointing amen you go find that in Stalin Hitler ikan musolini you say how could those how could those people fall under the deception of that man Hitler go go and listen to artificial intelligence they'll they'll take the H Hitlers I'll call them sermons because that's what they were and they'll take his sermons and they put it in his native in his tone and his in his voice but they put it to the English language it'll send shivers down your spine say what was it it was an an anointing he didn't realize he was under an anointing and the rest of the Germany didn't realize they were falling under an anointing you say an anointing to do what to destroy the Jews I tell you what the spirit the anointing that this nation has fallen under right now and the rest of this world is a is a is some of those 200 million demon Chargers that's why they attacked Israel on October 6 last year October 7th last year you say how could they do that because the minds of men have gone crazy and they don't know that they've ingested those demons as the prophet of God says it got on men like Stalin Hitler ikan musolini and he says and they went after the Jews to destroy them and they didn't know they were under an anointing you say where are those demon spirits today brother Matt the prophet tells us that they were released into the fourth dimension you say what is the fourth dimension brother map well I don't have my phone I thought that I did up here I'll show you hold up hold up your phone hold up your cell phone that's the fourth dimension brother bam said it's science and what do people do today they feed and feed and feed and feed and feed they don't realize that a prophet of God a Vindicated Prophet said this God will not destroy this world until the people get in the spirit of destruction and they don't know that the very news media and some of these things that you have on entertainment and Hollywood listen friends come on somebody help me preach this morning you be you better be careful what things you feed upon because it's those spirits that are driving the world out of their mind and they're coming under an anointing of a six old if they could fall under the six seal anointing what about a people who come under a seven seal anointing and it's not to prepare us for Destruction it's to prepare us to get out of here one day and he didn't realize the the prophet of God says something so powerful and he's he's talking about this human battle and then that battle you say what's what caused those demons to leave the war to leave heaven and go to Earth I tell you what happened is Jesus cast him out and I tell you what will cause the war to go to Armageddon is when God's bride cast him out amen and it's the greatest battle ever fought even the prophet of God dealt with that pressure just s that me and brother Joe how to sh we fellowship and about sometimes you go any preacher can can can can relate man you go to sometimes prepare a sermon and you don't even have nothing you've studied for days and you feel like you come to the pulpit inspiration list now the people would never know that but you feel like you ain't got nothing some of those times that's the greatest sermons you ever preach when you felt like you didn't have nothing but I was talking to brother Jo about that I said you know I was reading where brother brandham just says you know I went down to the basement to study and to pray and my brain my mind was just a million miles away from me couldn't get a thought what was it he felt that intense pressure it's a time of spiritual warfare it's a come on friends it's a time of pressure it's a time of spiritual warfare the enemy comes in like a flood and let me just say that those who are not sensitive to the war will become victims of the war War those who are asleep like lot and backsliding and cold and carnal in their heart you would just become a casualty to that six seal pre-tribulation anointing people who are not sensitive if we're not sensitive to the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit are filled just for a moment I watch people on their phones in church doing a million other things besides listening to the word of God and I don't criticize that I say God help that brother help me Lord do we realize this world has gotten people so laxidasical so Out Of Tune and out of touch that's for some the only time they hear the word of God is sitting on a CH church pew I don't say that to rebuke you I I say to myself to say God help us if this is the only time that we're tuning into that other dimension we end up just like that prophet of God says why I got it right here before me I'm just going to read it brother brandom says that that that the reason he says I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounded iniquity that the love of many will wax cold in the lady of SE or last age self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God listen to what he says we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard in their hearts because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit I raised my hands when I read this he says it's time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of this last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us you'll find that in the thigh tyon Church age I I just I can't get past this slide and I need to because I think of how how this condition didn't happen overnight because lukewarmness doesn't happen overnight it just starts with worldly distractions that all of us are susceptible to the Bible says because of the cares of this life that that listen the Bible says that because of that they were drunk not on wine but on the cares of this life say what are those cares not sinful things I'm just talking about normal things that we do on a daily basis but people are falling asleep their their their their experience has grown cold oh it's not what God did for you one time listen friends I'm all for a one-time experience but it's got to be a daily experience that we feed every day of Our Lives it's the pressure of the age it's the darkness pressing down upon people dark clouds listen you may not be able to see it here today and it looks sunny outside but in the spiritual climate of leosa it's a dark dismal day because my Bible says that it would be it would be dark and gross Darkness upon the face the knowledge would increase they'd get every learning every ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth you say brother Matt what is it it's a storm but I speak to that storm today and I say in the evening time it shall be light I'm not going to let it consume me I'm not going to let it consume my family I'm not going to let it consume my heart I'm going to speak to that storm of Le like Joshua fighting in the day of battle the Bible says he had ran the enemy's back oh oh but he needed some evening light brother Luther and the Bible says that the light shine what is it my brother my sister it's a dark day but arise Shine for thy light has come he had an evil heart left left I'm getting a sound warning the place you're in is very loud must mean Jesus isn't here brother bandam said everywhere he went there's noise I I tell you what friends that goes off in every church that every sermon I preach it goes off not not not that I preach even when I'm in the back there and I tell you what now I use it as a measure to go if it ain't going off something's wrong I say our our our our watches ought to be sounding an alarm the place you are in is very loud you people don't have an apple no I'm not even going there so he couldn't get past it I thought about that that do you realize lot what Legacy you're going to leave what are the consequences of your choice lot settles down in the sinful city of Sodom we know the story is hardships after being delivered wasn't ended Sodom the Bible says was a very Wicked City and even though lot was counted that as a righteous man a righteous man didn't belong there he allowed his family to become entrenched in the city and in its culture now we've got to walk a very fine line here because you're in the world but you're not of the world remember brother bam said I I it doesn't matter I'll just go be with the Indians they realize there's bad Indians too can't go anywhere but you can find a hiding plac God God is going to destroy it we know that here the angels we read the story they're demanding to have lots guests who are angels no not these were Angels which typed the angels that would come in this generation now remember brother Bram don't get confused brother brandham was the SE the seventh Church age messenger or seventh angel but the prophet says he wasn't not an angel like an Angelic being but Angel just means messenger and so these were Messengers when that messenger came to Abraham two goes down into Sodom and the prophet said it's a modern it's a type of the mzc sign of the son of man in Luke 17 that would come to the bride but at the same time the bride is receiving their sign the lukewarm church is receiving theirs and he sends a Billy Graham and an Oral Roberts and the prophet said it was their Ministries that were actually blinding the people from a false light the greatest robbery brother Brandon preaches in the flashing or the I know a man who could turn on the light the greatest robbery that ever happened happened in our day when they used they robbed a train using a false light and the prophet says in the greatest robbery the church has ever had is when sermons and preachers are preaching a false light say what is a false light a light from yesterday you got to walk in the light as he is in the light and then you have fellowship and the blood of Jesus his son cleanses you from all sin and actually think about that that that light preaching a previous light blinded them and here's an angel brother bam takes time and I don't have time to teach on it Graham g r h M5 and then brother Bram takes the last name brandom God changed Abraham's name from Abram to Abraham why did he do that for Abraham I happen to believe it wasn't just for Abraham but it was going to be a a it was going to be a signpost to you about the ministry that would come in this generation I was talking to my son Gideon I said do you realize something so powerful about Billy Graham who brother bam types as an angel that goes down to Sodom he's these angels that Lots with do you know you can go Google this if you want to go to Google it that that Billy Graham's daughter her name is Anne Graham she married a man and his last name is Lots l o TZ and if you ever click on her Wikipedia she's a preacher and her homepage is called Angel Ministries the ministry of an Graham Lots I don't think it's an accident lot here he is with these angels think about that you you can't even read some of this how did a Christian man not a Christian in the sense of of a Christian but a Believer righteous man get into such a condition the prophet of God said even Mrs lot Mrs lot was just a reflection of lot oh Brothers do we realize that our family is just a reflection of ourself okay I'll say Amen to it CU I'm not talking about just the good things I'm talking about all of the bad you got a garden and what are you planting in that Garden it will grow it will grow come on somebody I said it will grow even David comes to Solomon at the end and brings him in the room what's he doing he's passing the Legacy Elijah with Elisha he's passing Legacy Elijah with jehoash he's passion a legacy listen friends you will either pass a legacy by Design or by default but you will leave one we will leave an imprint we will leave an imprint upon those around us whether we want to or not we will leave a legacy you think about that as he brother bam says his wife even sister lot prophet of God says in time tested memorials Miss lot became very worldly taken up with the things of the world and then I stop at these words and he says Mrs lot didn't mean to do that when she went down there thought just be sociable all right to be sociable didn't mean to guarantee you lot never would have imagined that he losed that woman that he loved he never imagined that it would be his children later when they leave and lock his his daughters they an incest Cal relationship have children in the entire tribes of Moab and and and and you you say brother Matt why are you saying that because I promise he never sit in the church as a Believer he never would have dreamed he'd end up here never would have imagined he never would have thought that he brother brand and in in from that time and he deals with that little girl and he's there in the Psych wward in in in in in Flint oh Michigan and he's and and he goes to that insane asylum and and brother brandham says people just crawling on the walls banging their heads against the concrete and here's this little pretty young girl and brother Bram says oh my it's so overwhelming he says to her imagine as brother bram's there and he's looking at that situation saying this is so overwhelming and the little girl says brother Bram and and brother brandham says I don't even know where to start and that little girl says sir I wish you'd start with me brother bham says you you're not a patient she says yes sir I am says no no how you look perfectly fine he says I wish you'd let me tell you my story story I'm here as a patient I've lost my mind and the prophet begins to hear her story she says I went with the wrong boy got the wrong friends that's where it always starts and and she says he he he got me drink and he put something in my drink next thing I knew I had lost all of my all of my chastity she says I I had I I I had she said I I woke up her life was just overnight ruined and she says I I didn't mean I I thought about those words she didn't mean to she didn't mean to end up there how many times I've sat on the end of a h and I'm not saying this in any way to criticize them but how many times especially you don't have it here but out west it's in every corner it's been that way for years every time you stop at a stoplight there's a transient there a homeless person sleeping under the bridge or holding the sign up beard down to here how many times I've stopped there and not letting them notice that I'm looking and I'll just stare at their eyes and I'll think how did you get here how' you up there I promise you when you he that man was here he is now a beard down to here he's probably addicted to some drug he's homeless but I promise when he was four and five and six he never would have imagine he'd be standing on the side of a street like how did did it in there how does it end with lot and his family's fleeing took an angel to come out and rip him out of that City could never break the CT himself think how did he get there how did it start she says brother bam I just drank the wrong thing and I got with the wrong boy and the next thing I know she said I was I was I was an alcoholic I went to the good Shepherd's home went from protestantism converted to a Catholic thinking that was fixing it started drink it again convert it back to protestantism and then they took me to the good Shepherd's home and Alcoholics Anonymous and I got clean for a little while like lot got delivered out of Sodom for a little while but then I went right back to it she said and then I just became a full-blown alcoholic started thinking there was no hope for her and so she she says next thing I know I was on the street selling myself as a prostitute and now they put me here and I've lost my mind Bram says sis I think your case has never been through L diagnosed they're just trying to reform you you don't need Reformation you need transformation and she says don't you want to be a a wife yes don't you want to be a good a mother and have babies oh brother brandom oh that's the greatest thing I've always desired from a little girl but who would have me what do I have to give and brother Bram says oh sister she he says Jesus will take take you back she says me brother brandham what do I have to give Jesus brother Bram says there's only one thing you have to give him sister and that's your soul and she says oh when he have me back I'm such a I've defiled myself the prophet of God says sister the blood of Jesus oh I'm talking about her real blood this morning the blood of Jesus will take you back to your ver condition the blood of Jesus fixes every problem it heals every heart goes down and pray you know the story and she oh I'll be fine Brother BR says no uh no no no no you get back down on your knees you're just making a new start brother brandham goes to the hospital there praying for other people she's back down on her knees again brother Bram says all at once I heard something she got a hold of something and he said you'll never have to go back oh friends are you glad for the transformative blood of Jesus he he never would have imagined he got there I tell you what brother John ostein never would have imagined when he was in the prayer line and in the meetings with God's Prophet never imagine when his wife was hilled of breast cancer Assemblies of God preacher he'd never imagine that that would be his legacy modern day lot I promise when demon shakarian stood there with brother brandom at the full gospel businessman's meeting and stood with God's Prophet even Deus in the Bible who Paul the Apostle Paul talks about Deus I never I promised Demus would have never imagined when he's standing there with Paul but one day the Bible says Deus Paul says Deus has forsaken me having loved present World never would imagine Demons should care and you go on the Full Gospel businessman there's a website you go on it's powerful go hear the the businessman's breakfast you could hear brother Brandon you could hear Brother Deus get up there and introduce God's Prophet now every would have imagine though that Deus would one day in his life forsake the ministry and walk away from the message and say he's washed up it was a prophet sent to bring healing and now he's getting all mixed up trying to teach the word he never would have imagined that his great granddaughters would be the Kardashians listen friends when you leave this message you are leaving Jesus Christ you mean to say that I said it just the way I meant it I would have defended Jesus had I lived there I would have never got him crucified the prophet says tell me what you do with the message of the hour which is Christ for your day and I'll tell you what you would have done back then he never would have me me he never would have thought the prophet says of Lot's wife when God gave her last message of Grace those angels down there told them within a few hours that Sodom and gomor was going to be burned up she could not stand the thought of giving up her social life to come out into a desert she couldn't stand it that Modern Woman couldn't stand to come out to the desert to live like Sarah out there in the desert to have to wear common plain clothes of women in the plane she wanted to be in luxury her husband had become a great man in the city he sat at the gate as a judge she wanted these luxuries she couldn't think about it my brother my sister she couldn't stand the thought of having to give those things up and as she went out with her husband she kept looking back weeping and grieving because she had to give it up to separate herself you know what it was she was forced to come out and and there's such a difference when you force someone to come out because you can force the body but you can't force the heart that's why we received a message that didn't give us a body dress code and all the outward external but the the Bible says it will turn the hearts of the children when you turn the heart the body turns with it the reason people leave this message is because their heart was never connected to it and eventually the heart leaves long before for the body but the body will always follow the heart and the prophet of God takes time to point that out and says she was looking back over her left shoulder representing her heart brother bam says she looked back where her heart was oh but I think of another man I think of another Legacy think did did he ever realize did he know the imprint or the impact of his legacy and he's prophesied over and says because thou has chosen the Heart Way thou has walked in the path of your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise I love that thou has has picked the correct and precise decision and it's what way the harder way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven will await thee what a glorious decision thou has made oh brother bradam did you realize because you were going to be an Abraham she was going to be a Sarah and lot did you realize because you were going to be a lot she was going to be Lot's wife oh my brother my sister do we realize you'll never have a a Rebecca without an Isaac you'll never have a a bride a groom without a bride you'll never have a bride without a groom and I could never be anything if it wasn't for this word this word changed my life I say thank God for a prophet who stood for the word of God and didn't compromise for Sodom I'm here today married to an an Isaac because of an elaser I think of that did you ever realize it was that momentous decision this and itself will make come to pass play that for me the tremendous victory in the love divine go ahead and play that you in the back there m if you could have that just make sure the sound is on I just want to play this I got three minutes and I'm going to end it right here did he realize that great momentous decision the prophet of God says that great momentous decision that a huge portion of heaven will await thee what a glorious decision thou has made bring it over brother Mark and I heard something say would you like to see just beyond the curtain bring it up I said it would help me so much and I looked in just a moment I place I looked back and there I was laying on the bed and I said this is a strange thing now I would not want you to repeat this this is before my church are my sheep that I am pastoring whether it was I was in this body or out whether it was a translation it wasn't like any Vision I ever had I could look there and I could look here and when I hit that little place I've never seen so many people come running screaming oh our precious brother and I looked in young women maybe in their early 20s 18 to 20 they were throwing their arms around me and screaming our precious brother here come young man in the brilliant of Young Manhood and their eyes glistening and looking like stars on a darken night their teeth as white as Pearl and they were screaming in grabbing me and screaming oh our precious brother and I stopped and I looked and I was young I looked back at my old body laying there with my hands behind my head and I said I don't understand this and these young women throwing their arms around me now I do realize this is a mixed audience and I say this with the sweetness and with the melness of the spirit man cannot put your arm around women without uh a human sensation but it wasn't there there was no yesterday or tomorrow they didn't get tired they were I never seen such pretty women in all my life they had a hair way down to their waistline long skirts to their feet and they were just a hugging me it wasn't a hug like even my own sister sitting there would have hug me they were not kissing me and I was not kissing them it was something that I I have not got the the vocabulary I haven't got the words to say perfection wouldn't touch it suburb wouldn't even touch it nowhere it was something that I never you just have to be there and I looked this way and that way and they were coming by the thousands and stuff and I said I don't understand this I said by they and here come hope that was my first wife she run and never said my husband she said my precious brother and when she hugg me there was another woman standing there that hugged me and then hope hugged this woman and each one and I thought this has to be something different it can't be there's something I would I ever want to go back to that old carcass again I looked around there and I thought what is this and I looked real good and I I said I I can't understand this but hope seemed to be like uh oh a guest of honor she was no different but just like a guest of honor and I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preach was the Holy Ghost Hallelujah this is perfect love and nothing can ere without it I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there was no jealousy there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never end there mortality could never make you old and the they could not cry it was just one Joy oh my precious bre and they took me up and set me up on a great big high place and I thought I am not dreaming I'm looking back at my my body laying down on the bed and they set me up there and I said oh I shouldn't set up here and here come women and man from both sides just in their Bloom of Youth screaming and one woman was standing there and she screamed oh my precious brother oh we are so happy to see you here I said I don't understand this and then that voice that was speaking from above me said you know it is written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people and I said yes I remember that in the scriptures said well this is when you will gather with your people amen I said then they'll be real and I can feel them oh yes I said but I there's a Millions there's not that many Brams and that boy said there are not Brams them your converts Hallelujah that's the ones that you've led to the Lord thank you Jesus and said some of them women there you think is so beautiful we're better than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord no wonder there screaming our precious brother and they screamed all once said if you hadn't have went we wouldn't be here I looked around I thought well I don't get it I said oh where is Jesus I want to see him so bad they said now he's just a little higher right up that way said someday he will come to you he said you were sent for a leader glory and God will come and when he does he'll judge you according to what you taught them first whether they go in or not we'll go in according to your teaching I said oh I'm so glad if Paul does he have to stand like this does Peter have to stand like this yes I said then I preached every word that they preached I never did it from one side to the other were they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I did too were they taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did too whatever they Tau I did too and then people scream and said we know that know we're going with you someday back to Earth said Jesus will come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preached us and then if you are accepted at that time what you will be and said then you will present us to him as your trophies of your ministry said you will guide us to him and all together we'll go back to the Earth to live forever I said do I have to return back now yes but keep pressing I looked and I could see the people just as far as I could see still coming wan to hug me screaming our precious brother just that a voice said oh all that you ever loved glor and all that ever loved you God has given you here and I looked and here come my old dog come walking up here come my horse and laid his head up over my shoulder nickered said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given them into your hands come brother Tony through your ministry and I felt myself moved from that beautiful place and I looked around I said are you awake honey she's still asleep and I thought oh god oh help me oh God never let me compromise with one word let me stay right straight on that word and preach it I don't care what comes or goes what any body does how many SS of Sons of Kish rise how many this that other let me Lord press to that place all fear of death I say this is my Bible before me this morning I've got a little boy there four years old to be raised I got a nine-year-old girl and a teenager that I'm thankful for that's turned the way of the Lord amen God let me live to bring them up in the admiration of God and above that the whole world seems to scream to me 90y old women and man and all kinds if you hadn't have went we wouldn't been here God let me press the battle yes but if it comes to dying I am no more it would be a joy it would be a pleasure to enter from this corruption and disgrace if I could make up the 100 billion miles high a square block and that's perfect love each step this way it Narrows until we get down to where we are now it would be just merely a shadow of corruption that little something that we can sense and feel that there's something somewhere we don't know what it is oh my precious friends my beloved my darlings of the Gospel my begotten children under god listen to me oh Pastor amen you I wish there was some way I could explain it to you there's no words I couldn't find it it's not found anywhere but just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing that you ever there is no way to explain it there's no way I just can't do it but whatever you do friends lay aside everything else to you want to do perfect love yes Lord get to a spot that you can love everybody every enemy everything else yes Lord stand to your feet by your heads with me Bible says remember think about how close he almost made it out got to the very Gates of Sodom I can hear I can read you the words of Spurgeon so powerful about the trag tragedy of this woman he says Doom befell her at the gates of zor oh if I must be damned let it be with the mass of the ungodly having always been one of them but to get to the very Gates of Heaven and to perish there will be the most awful thing friends you know what's beautiful is we don't have to we got a choice here today and I just want to say by an uplifted hand I'd invite you to do it with me to say to the Lord as God's Prophet said God don't ever let me compromise with this word don't ever let me compromise Lord but let me now more than ever before press the battle let me get to that place of perfect love perfect love where I love God's word listen you can't love God if you don't love his word you might love an imagination of fiction of your imaginative picture you've made of Jesus but if you really love Jesus you love his word and I say God let me get to the place to where I love your word let me love it God I'll forsake everything for it I'll give myself holy to it and God don't let me be a lot oh oh I just feel the inspiration of the Holy Spirit here friends I just want to say this and I hesitate but I just want to say it today I I I just I want to say thank you God thank you that you've called me out of Sodom I could have been just like lot you could have been just like lot I look at those around me and I look at men who have their wives and their family dressed in to the tilts and makeup and and shorts and cut hair and walking out half naked and I just think to myself oh God how easily
