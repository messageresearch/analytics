you happy to have you here today joy in that wonderful singing amen we have a number of families enjoying Services up in Tennessee this weekend so we want to be praying for all of them they'll be on the road coming back and they want the Lord to just amen give them a great great blessing amen I got one request that came in from Brother Bruce concerning sister Linda I want to take that to the Lord just in a moment when we pray and she's been having severe headaches which causes nausea and a constant nagging cough so there's some things that are uh are from her medications and different things as Brother Bruce said that one I read here's the here's the updated one yes a very fitful night last night with various medical things she's been dealing with amen so they're asking prayer for her this morning we sure want to ask the Lord for that amen God bless you uh we're going to turn right into Matthew's gospel um this morning I want by the help of the Lord get back to another installment in the series we've been working on rebuilding Eden and I want to make some more progress today this would be part six amen Matthew chapter 12. where we'll be headed to you can read it also from I think it's also recorded in Luke but we're going to catch this reading they seem to be pretty much identical amen praise the Lord uh Matthew chapter 12 just one verse and we're going to let you be seated after we will read this verse and we'll have prayer and then you can be seated Matthew chapter 12 and just one verse in verse 42. he's a speaking the queen of the South shall rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the Earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon let's power hearts in our heads this morning Father we thank you this morning Lord for this Gathering of people for the songs Lord of Zion that have been sung in the worship Lord I trust that you have been made to feel and that you presently do feel very welcome Lord in our midst we're here today with the need to hear from you Lord I pray that your word will come forth to meet every need in the building father and those who would be listening out across the airwaves or hear it at a later time we humble ourselves before you now we ask for your anointing once again Lord once more father let your word go forth Lord with clear understanding that it might accomplish the reason it was sent for now father we are asking humbly for our dear sister Linda Paris Lord that you would be very kind to her this morning and show a great kindness Lord touch our sister Lord may she find relief there's others Lord that are perhaps unspoken Quest that I don't see any request him but I know that some others are sick and not feeling well today so I pray for them you know all about it Lord now bless the word bless the speaker and the hearers we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated amen we'll have my title slide up Noah thank you so the queen of the south of course this is we who we know to be the Queen of Sheba who came to hear the wisdom of Solomon and I want you to catch my subtitle there on the titles on the title slide my subtitle is choosing the right path to Redemption there there's nothing more valuable to you than Redemption no matter what you would ever achieve in this life if you miss out on that you miss everything oh everything that you could accomplish whatever station you could arrive to whatever uh fortune and Glory whatever social standing whatever uh influence and as an influencer you might be in the world if you miss out on the Redemption of your soul then your life has been lived in vain your life wasn't given to you to be famous in the world it is generally not as James taught us it is very generally at their exceptions but it is generally not the the famous and the wise of the world that God goes after God goes after Humble Hearts his family are simple people who just are simple enough to have the wonderful uh unique ability to just believe God just believe him just say he said it I believe it there's nothing else now as the old timer would say enough said God said it I believe it I've said see so so we find that this is a a wonderful treasure that we have to be able to see the things especially considering that it is that scripturally speaking that the overwhelming oh and that's really an understatement but I can't think of a stronger word but the overwhelming majority of humanity since the Garden of Eden according to the Bible are will be lost and destroyed by their own refusal to believe God's simple word it is a very rare a very small Jesus declared it you see it all through the Old Testament stories you find that brother Branham you know Jesus talked about straight As the gate narrow is the way that leadeth unto redemption or salvation and there will only be a few that find it brother Branham talks about that uh you know when they're asking him concerning the Rapture and brother Branham says you know you can see in the Book of Revelation that John sees a number that no man could number but a prophet says but don't forget that's across thousands of years and multiple ages but that he says when it comes to that Rapture there will just be a very few make that rapture see a very few and so we're we're we're we're we're we're realizing today that that we can't save the world from its annihilation in fact is the gospel this might shock you but the gospel didn't come to save the world from its Annihilation the fact that God is it's because God's not going to destroy it anyway it's simply going to transition and that's going to happen and all the king's horses and all the king's men can't stop that you understand the same Jesus that sent his disciples with the gospel foretold of the world being destroyed that it was going to transition and that Israel wouldn't receive it now but she would eventually be restored as the leading nation of the earth she's a far cry from that now and you're never going to get the world to vote on that but we find that God's going to bypass the will of Fallen man and he's going to establish his will in the earth and I just find myself incredibly happy today that I have come across an agreement in my heart something inside of me says Lord I agree with you no matter what you're saying I just want you to know I'll agree with you today I'll agree with you tomorrow whatever befalls whatever I face whatever happens whatever transpires I'm in this for Keeps previously in our series we've looked closely at Abel coming forward we broke it down how that he was bringing a proper offering that was designated to appease God God who had my had given so much to humanity gave mankind everything that he could ever need life eternal and a perfect perfect life at that and a a beautiful world that where there was no sin or disease or sickness he didn't have to work by the sweat of his brow everything all was peace forevermore every day was was Heaven on Earth and so it's so sad that he was repaid with disobedience from his from the very family that he had been given life to we found that Abel came forward to try if possible to set things right between himself and his maker and it worked amen good news it worked it demonstrated that you know when you when you bring to God something that is according to his word he will supply you with everything you need for life he will give you every good gift that he can send down from above he will open the storerooms of his treasures and send you down blessing on top of blessing and he will help you and he will give you Liberty from the devil and he will set you back in your right mind and he will give you a purpose for your life all you have to do has come his provided path you have to choose the right path to Redemption there would be a path it wouldn't be willy-nilly or random and you certainly don't get to decide that since Humanity was the one who broke the world and collapsed and brought sin into the world I think it's a pretty a pretty reasonable that God says how about I figure out how to fix it it's beautiful because Abel was Abel was so overwhelmingly successful uh and and you can see that in that God gave an immediate and and no restrained respect to his offering of an innocent life to be given in sacrifice for the guilty it's not as atheists would like to say oh a bloody God a crew God has nothing to do with that God wasn't satisfied with Abel slaughtering one of his animals God God did that didn't bring God Joy even the death of The Sinner does not bring God Joy God wishes for all men to be saved and takes no pleasure in the death of even his enemies as we said last time here he is in a conversation with Cain and God's love is so great that he's trying to save his arch enemy's son now his Lucifer had already made his choice he had already denied and crossed the line between judgment and mercy but God so loved the world and loved life that he's actually trying to coax the son of his arch enemy into accepting just accept a a kind of a way uh just you know you'll never get the Revelation but if you'll just do like your brother then I'll find a way to save you and God does that he'll do that at the Judgment bar he'll try to save everybody he can everybody who had any type any even the even the you find that even the it's he's not going to save you for iniquitous works that's nauseating to him so don't go around trying to do good deeds and earn your way into heaven that's that's never going to end well for you but but where the ones that you do see him saving are those who who just they had the right heart response to at whatever level that God revealed himself at whatever level they saw as much as they could see they responded in their heart to that and it became a natural response they didn't even know they were pleasing him this is how broad and deep and wide is the love of God see and so it's it's not about you know God is not satisfied with the fact that he's not getting Glee out of the fact that one of his innocent Lambs is being slaughtered while it cries and bleats and bleeds out and begging you know if it could speak language begging for this human not to kill him what are you doing you know why are you chopping at my throat why am I on this rock why why are you killing me and and it's not that Abel is getting satisfaction or that God is getting satisfaction but Abel found an overwhelming success uh by getting God's respect because God could see that someday this was this was a testimony that someday he would come as the Lamb of God and he would allow himself to be slaughtered by Humanity to do what to save Humanity it's amazing that God would do it that way God would in fact is God would require nothing more of Abel nothing more because this sacrifice God would see that it's fulfilling his purpose that he has in an age to come where once again I want to say to you today very happily where once again God will require nothing more of you just like he required nothing more of Abel than to bring the right sacrifice and I'm here to tell you you can't earn your way into heaven but good news you don't have to God will require nothing from you but that you accept the once and for all time sacrifice of the Lamb of God given on your behalf and that he died he died once unto sin and in that he dieth no more the Bible says he doesn't need to once you've passed from Death unto life you can never come into the Judgment you've passed into life you've passed into Mercy you have entered back into that place of fellowship with God and from that point there's not enough devils in Hell Or Not Enough mistakes in your life to ever undo that that change that God has brought in you by this God can restore and he does restore your soul back to an eternal State and nothing more could ever be required of you than to believe in him and to accept him as Lord in your life are you willing to do that today good then you're on the path to Redemption amen allowing him to do the work of redemption allowing him say what it what is rebuilding brother Jason you're this is part six of rebuilding Eden what is it he's rebuilding he's re not just building a new world back he's not just changing the geography of the earth and restoring a garden he's he's before he can restore and Eden he's got to restore Adam and Eve oh my and that's what he's doing today friends say what is it he's restoring in me he's restoring in you that thing that they had that unbroken unlimited Fellowship not not God in heaven or way across the ocean but face to face lift here to be able to commune with Christ almighty God he's restoring that Fellowship where where his mind is your mind and his thoughts and his desires can literally become your entire desire that's what the Holy Ghost does for your friends it restores Fellowship to where you can think like him and act like him and love like him and forgive like him and desire like him of course we found in previous installments uh I'm not going to go down the trail of it today again just to remind you that immediately we found his half-twin brother trying to impersonate this action through reasoning unwilling to come God's way uh it wouldn't end good for for Cain so we find then that it begs the question today what is what what is it that the impersonation of Christianity cannot produce what is it preacher that the impersonation of Christianity cannot produce because we do see people singing songs out of hymnals and we do see people reading scriptures out of the Bible and we do see churches and we do see music and we do see people in their Sunday clothes and we do see tears and we do see hands up and and we do hear singing and we do see program and we and we we seek good deeds and good works and and goodness and good that but and and an impersonation of Christianity can do all of that because it impersonates the fine qualities of Jesus that's what brother Branham called it they they they it's not a hard change not a heart transplant but it is a mental acceptance because they admire the fine qualities of Jesus well who wouldn't he was the finest man to ever live he was the most noble most honest most kind most helpful most sacrificial most humble most everything most true most pure there's never a man like this man who own the world and everything on it but allowed himself to be taken down so that he could lift himself back up and bring his family with him oh Hallelujah because I live you can live also hallelujah what a promise to the world in its sad condition so if we see all of these things that impersonation of Christianity can produce brother Jason what is it what is that which the impersonation of Christianity cannot produce there is one thing you say only one well it just so happens that it's the most vital thing to happen in this day and that is an impersonation of Christianity cannot produce a word Revival cannot an impersonation of Christianity cannot restore you back to fellowship which is what a Revival of the word does because when the when the word I mean everything is predicated upon faith in the word everything and the the the the the Seven Virtues that Simon Peter describes began with the foundation of faith God when he spoke the world into existence he even had to believe his own word see and so so we realized that that faith in the word brings a a Revival of life it the the word Revival the the the the the the Revival of the word brings back every every Power every influence every strength every energy that you have needed do need or couldn't ever need and I don't even know what tomorrow holds for any of you including myself but I do know this a word revival can meet the challenge of Satan any time any place and under any condition and I don't have to back up and I don't have to run scared I can stand on the word of God and Proclaim it and it will it will release creative power we've seen that happen the reason being is that when you when you choose an impersonation of Christianity you're basing it's just based on man-made systems of reasoning and the problem is is the reason there can't be a word Revival is that they when you do that you only go further and further away as time goes on you move further away from the original once you once you take the original word and you mongrelize it at all and by injecting man-made ideology the moment you do that that's the closest you'll ever be again to the word and from there you'll just drift away and away and away and you can never get back you could never get back now see the a word Revival doesn't fade away a word Revival draws you to it draws you back to the original say What's the value of that the original is where the life is The Originals where everything is I mean that's the natural types of spiritual you can see that in physical science you they they they know and this is this is factual it's a physics is kind of my hobby side hobby thing but but I but I I happen to know that that you cannot man can't Mankind in this realm cannot see the beginning of the universe now the reason for that is is because he he cannot see back to the Big Bang it's impossible now brother Branham didn't use that term brother Branham called it uh Adam bursted God spoke and an atom burst it so big bang fine I have no problem with the big bangers that's what they want to call it uh like brother Joe Daniels says I I don't care about the Big Bang that's fine just tell me who pulled the trigger foreign they were talking about the Cradle of mankind and they start talking about that and that's what brother Joe told him I don't care about the Big Bang that's fine but I just want to know who pulled the trigger somebody did a prophet said God did God spoke and then Adam burst it and so the reason now but now what that means is is that the only way you see at distance is light travels through space and you're looking at stars perhaps that were formed or burned out eons ago but the light is just now reaching the Earth and you see it like there it is but actually it's already gone or another one's already replaced it and the universe is expanding they know that that that it's expanding from the center I know that we think we're in the center of the universe you're actually not you're not even in the center of your own Galaxy but but we find that that once the bank ex once the first atom bursted and to use brother branham's language clinkers flew everywhere they went out in all directions burning molten lava burning and and hurling out through space I mean and and so because that it's because we're moving away from it there's no way for the light to ever reach us so you can't see back that far I mean in fact is they can see radiation uh kind of a leftover signature in it well once one space became transparent at first that was wasn't the case and brother Brandon's language proves that that it was almost a burning molten hot lava it was all chaos see it's beautiful when you when you let science agree with God's science it becomes a beautiful thing to look at because you can see these types and shadows and so because we've been blown out we're constantly moving away from what that was so the light of that there's no way for us to ever go back and see that now on the other side I think everything's going to be different But but so you so you just understand so you can the most we can see is traces of radiation left over uh but that's even they know it's almost 400 000 years after the Adam so let's see one please work you can't you can't try to use human breathing because sooner you human reasoning I'm not sure sorry sorry you know I I love it when when bro comes along and can describe that me in detail because I promise you after physicists have a lot of captions understanding and they also taste like what I don't know well we're not sure what we think but we don't know Nation and then this is [Music] stop and they stopped and pull everything the Bible said on creation everything is confidence to you okay to do that it's a beautiful thing God of course because here and they better have fun and it goes better perfect with his body one thing wrong he went to the presence of God most Moses because it was a prophet and at the office understands it's minister of tradition Jesus came to the office of man of God revealed so this is human reason and God's right away you can store Fellowship Fellowship God is restored your are you end up break the mind of Christ what advantage that is so if you if you want to take the path that strong human reasoning [Music] good look at that that's free my house a word Revival and I like this is what rebuilding even is all about it's not just rebuilding a land where we go but he's rebuilding me what is he what does he think he's not building into something he's reading you back this is sent Jesus Christ oh I have no other source job find my boat afraid no dent I was looking for a song we were rooms and freaks children like that with a club Owners but now after 2 000 years but now after two thousand years of theology teaching now the entire church the elect Church looking for the Messiah now he have to act when he's coming this time just like he did he will have to do the same thing he would do it there's there is going to be billions with the population are going to miss out on heaven simply because didn't follow them right there know that one chance see oh my God he conquered death by the real seed them all right foreign that conked up again amen he is still here alive in that there was a match Abraham that's what an important point was the price let me give you an illustration I don't remember the person anytime if you ever read me doing program come to the geology and never skip and some of the most profound foods are actually and and other things that you'll notice is you'll find it pick up certain image people track but then but every once in a while when you read through genealogy you read about and when turning this one out and then went from and then he traveled and my wife had a son and then and then you you literally all the way through and find potentials coming all the way up up control all the way through Abraham oh no all the way you can go all the way through Moses and come through the Prophet come all the way in and you feed it all right Jesus is the Priceline that just run you've got one that keeps and keeps going keep going going what you're doing it is a c-line price all the way description but Jesus stood talking to those sons of Jacob who is the son of Isaac who was the son of Abraham and that your father see so there's but there were some of them to receive Christ he said have a common father people Lord Jesus oh my God hey so so why don't you understand it that way then you you can see Christine always and always manifest characteristics all right now what time incredible hey Preacher Brother you should have seen all the young girls said that I'm pretty girl so we found this incredible Queen of the South there on the left and you which the Sheep coming solid the Harlan Jericho and it's it's amazing but these young women who literally ripped everything for one purpose to see Central if God was real because everything that everybody have oh if there is less time the queen she was taught now you can't go under that Revival of Solomon's we've got here but they've been personal information true God be more than this at a church and a bishop and and church services and more Royal duties and I just I age out and I die and the next Queen comes along behind me I can't accept that that's all I'm here for you know what was down inside her heart a Christ's seed a Christ line as we talked to you last time about a receiving set you remember brother brother Ed found that great big tower there in the Canadian wilderness and he said it's sending out signals and receiving signals he said I didn't hear any of it because I don't have a receiving set he said if I had a receiving said I could hear what the signals are being transferred and that's what's happening the sound of the Gospel went into all the world but they couldn't mix it with faith they heard preachers preach but it meant nothing to them but to you and I when we heard the gospel it meant something something we couldn't even put in words something we couldn't quite explain or put our finger on but we we knew I have to go this way well it'll cost you your family well I still got to go your friend your career your hair I still gotta go this way are you crazy maybe but I can't resist it I'm what is it you're hearing I don't know but I'm hearing from another realm drawing me to something you can't explain Revelation it's impossible you sound you sound nuts that people lay aside everything in the world and all their Pursuits like Paul mean nothing Paul a Pharisee of the Pharisees first in his class absolutely the the president of the student body I I don't even know what the one is will you graduate with the top honors what they call that but but Paul was all of that and he says he says I forgot it all to do why'd you do that so that I could know him oh I could a preacher could have told you about him no not like that I want to know him in the power of his resurrection I would annoy him in the fellowship of his sufferings I want to you understand I want to know him I don't want to know about him I want to know him two incredibly Brave young women who couldn't be more different yet they were very much the same separated by hundreds of years lived in different parts of the Earth yet they shared a a deep feeling in their heart of hearts that if they're really was a true God surely he would be like the god of Israel that they had heard so much about brother Bynum tells the story much better than I can he's such a master at it he says in the Queen of Sheba he says just think the people passing by these would be the Caravan she didn't have internet back then just think the people passing by would say oh you should come to our nation see our great power for God why he works among our people he he does great signs and wonders and we got a king called Solomon you should see the great discernment that man's God why it's beyond thought well you know Faith cometh by hearing doesn't it hearing the word of God see so the nudes spread all over the world everywhere heard about this and they all began to fear because not fearing Solomon but fearing God because the Living God was showing finally the news got way down into Sheba way down about 300 miles south way down across the Sahara Desert now they didn't have television in them days and radio and newspapers and telephones they just traveled by lip to ear and Caravans would come through and bring the news and everybody come down into Sheba would say to this to the little Queen say you should go into Palestine you know they got a god up there that so blessed them people they're all with one Accord there's no friction among them at all and they got a a brother up there they call him Solomon they've made him the king and they tell me that God uses him for everything they got they have need of for everything they got they have need of he he's he just was able to tell them you know the faith cometh by what hearing the word and blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled so the little Queen began to hunger she thought you know I'll have to go see that now you remember she's got a lot of prestige you know because she's Queen so I suppose she said well before I go before I do this now I better go ask the pastor whether I can go or not see because I have to get permission from my denomination Wow have a hard time reading this have to get permission from my denomination because that that's another denomination see I better go ask my pastor if I can go am I free um oh my don't live under that whatever you do don't live under that you have been called to freedom in the Holy Spirit Hallelujah you've been called that's what that's Western Bethel Tabernacle is the Lord Jesus Christ that's why my door says assistant pastor he's our pastor Hallelujah oh my says now so I can see so I can see her walk over a little guard with her and she said Holy Father may I have the permission from you from this great holy church that we have here in Sheba may I have the permission for you for you they're having a Revival up in Palestine may I go may I be able to attend that Revival nonsense my daughter oh I love this line now if there was such a thing as that I'd have heard that not I've heard that nonsense too there's nothing to it it's a bunch of Holy Rollers there's nothing to it but look if there was any power in God it would be in our God right here it would come to our organization it would be ours if there's anything to it see oh brother you know the devil takes his man but never Spirit that's right God takes his two but never his spirit he took Elijah but his Spirit come upon Elisha then it come on John the Baptist and he took his son Jesus see but the Holy Ghost come back in the church to do the same Works he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also see keeps on going down and the devil takes this his man but never the spirit them two Spirits are still warring with one another right on down now said you cannot go see now that's the exact same message Cain was trying to give to Abel you can't offer that kind of an offering because I can't get it so you can't have it you know whatever I can get that's the limits of what you can have well sorry but I'm not going to be limited by man-made theology I am free in the Holy Spirit to believe every word of God so he never takes his Spirit at any and now said no you cannot go well she said listen you know there's something down in my heart you know there's something about it see she's trying to explain it she can't she can't put a word on it she can't put her finger on it there's something down in my heart you know there's something about it when God gets a hold of a human heart they do funny things amen when God gets a hold of a human heart they do funny things yeah said but you know what I've had Holy Father dear Bishop General overseer I have had such a great desire to go I've always heard of those things and I would like to go now look child we'll just excommunicate you right off the books we'll just take you your name right off this organization if you go up well she said but look I Won't Do no harm I'll come right back down here of course and as soon as the Revival is over as soon as I go up but you cannot go I've made that declaration and that's what the rest of them says and that's what we have to stand by now if there's anything like that going on it would be right here with us I can see that little Queen oh I say what kind of eyes did that Prophet have I can see that little Queen God moving on her heart this is this is an incredible this is girl power starting to work right here I can see that little Queen got moving on her heart she squared herself off and said I want to tell you something brother random says we need more of them we need more of them brother Branham is not advocating women's Liberation and bossing their husbands around what God what the word of God is advocating what a prophet is advocating is a woman should just as much as a man who has just as much right to it stand on the word of God and say I'm a Christian and I'm a Believer and if I have to be a Believer by myself I'm going to be a believer that's girl power girl power isn't the kind that puts you out here with a cigarette in your mouth and and high-heeled shoes and tight-fitting clothes so that Hollywood and so that evil men can gawk and stare at you but there is a girl power and it's in the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and her powers and her character he said I can see that he says I can see that little Queen God moving on her heart she squared herself off and said I want to tell you something brother Brandon says we need more of them I've been in this thing for years and years my mother was in it my grandmother my grandmother was in it and all I've seen is a bunch of papers a bunch of writing and talking about some God but I haven't seen any kind of a move at all of any I don't want these dead things Hallelujah they tell me they got one up there that's a living that lives in his people and that's what I want amen God give us some more Queens of Sheba in Long Beach God give us some more Queens of Sheba of the pride of Christ in Beaufort South Carolina I don't want a dead gospel I don't want a dead religion I want to have a living presence of God I don't have something can change my life and and save me and redeem me and make me like God is not interested in man-made systems I hate those things says I want to see something that's got life in it I want to see something I've been reading all the Scrolls of their books up there and they tell me that God is a God that knows the secrets of the hardness poor girl had a lot on her heart and they tell me that that man Solomon up there the pastor is just able to do these things and it's wonderful and I'm going to see it if you do excuse me what happened I lost uh oh I got it here we just lost okay there it is says uh and I'm going to see it if you do I'll just take you right off the book well you might as well take me right now because I'm going brother Bradham says I like that I'm going anyhow I'm going anyhow I don't care what the devil say I don't care what the world correctness I'm going anyhow I want to be free I want to have the power of God moving in my life not interested in a in a form of religion I don't want an impersonation of Christianity I want to know when I lay my head on my pillow at night father's pleased with me I want to know when I wake up in the morning I can lift Praises that he'll receive I'm like Abel at my at my rock and I'm offering him the Praises that he can receive that my life is a willing sacrifice to God in that way do you admire this queen today a second incredible woman seems anything but when we when we first meet Rahab in the Book of Joshua she's a woman rejected by society and forced into a very wretched existence by by hardship brother Branham and a paraphrase of a quote I don't have it in front of me brother Branham says perhaps she was forced into a life of harlotry by extreme poverty in her family can you imagine that friends uh a young innocent girl Lord help me to stay on target here forced to give up her Purity for money oh look cruelty of sin cruelty sin No Doubt like any young girl she had dreams and aspirations and to someday have a man that she loved and family to call her own and side effects and the terrible consequences that the curse of sin had brought upon this young girl say why why is it matter to you she's my sister she's my sister she's part of the family of God and I it breaks my heart that someday I'll meet her oh I'm gonna meet her I'm gonna hug her without any restraint I won't have to worry about a body that'll trap me up I can just Embrace and say rehab God bless you I love you I love your story it inspired me it was real girl power thank you and not death said the Cain why are you why are thou Roth why is that countenance falling you'll be accepted if you do right but if you refuse to do right hear the words of God to the to some of the first humans on Earth you'll be accepted if you do what is right but if you refuse to do what is right then watch out watch out sin is crouching at the door eager to control you but you must subdue him you must be his master poor Rahab what a crushy blow to the heart of a young girl leave but that life was a cruel joke and there's no way out of her misery trapped in it there's no way to break the chains of sin off of herself and wishing so wouldn't make it wishing wouldn't make it so she can wish all she wants you can wish all you want but wishing won't make it so but down in her heart she couldn't accept something wouldn't let her say this is all there is no something down inside of her heartburn and Rahab knew all she knew she had a she had secret thoughts in her heart that she had never said out loud and we wouldn't even know it if a prophet hadn't read between the lines for us if a prophet hadn't read between the lines I wouldn't know half the the story today that I'm telling you out of the Bible not something that's something that she couldn't quite identify that's something she couldn't quite put her finger on but it wasn't nothing it wasn't nothing there was something in her oh just like just like you know she felt it and and and and she had Brethren said she always thought you know it's not something she could say out loud but she always felt that if there was a real God he'd be a living God powerful and he'd be kind and he'd help me he would help me he would help me get out of this misery he'd help me change my life he'd help me become a new creation there was something down inside of her the same receiving scent was in her that is in me that is in you I know him to be a real God a living God who'll help me Hallelujah and when she heard the stories of the Israelites oh my how her heart her Young Heart must have left with hope could it be true could it be true could God really be that real could God really care about somebody like me maybe that's where you find yourself today friends maybe you're find yourself like Rahab and you find yourself trapped maybe you know you're a child of God but you're trapped nonetheless I'm here to tell you there's someone who can help you there's someone who's all-powerful or someone who can fix whatever's wrong there's someone who can give you the desire of your heart and make your dreams for eternal life and eternal joy and eternal happiness it's not somewhere over a rainbow it's right here in the word of God today it could not be it could not be it could not be her human Fallen nature that desired that there's no way because the Bible says the nature you're born with is enmity against God could never agree with God doesn't desire God at all her her life her life just like the Earth had been in chaos her life was in chaos but oh I'm so glad to know that just like the chaos of Eden when the spirit of God began to move on that chaos and it began to move on rehab it's beginning to move in your hearts today I trust it's moving in Hearts young and old alike here today to say I'll take all that chaos and I'll bring it all back around the correct way I I you know I she she's picking up a signal are you picking up a signal today a signal that maybe no one else can hear it maybe no one else can sense it but she could hear it she could sense it I hear it I sense it I love it I've heard it I've heard it have you heard it that same signal is speaking today Rahab was the lesser of these two ladies by far but she ends up really with a greater testimony as far as a testimony is concerned she becomes the last becomes first and the first becomes last because she came from an impossible situation as they say from the gutter most to the uttermost this this fur you know the whole if you read that in the Bible the first shall be last and the last shall be first actually it all starts because Jesus is you can go back and read it but he's telling a you know a story in the Bible about the Rich Young Ruler that we have portrayed here considering the word of God Jesus had just finished telling about this this story was a true story and a rich man a rich young man came forward Master what must I do to inherit eternal life and so Jesus you know the story I don't need to repeat all that today I'm trying to save some time but after that you know and and Jesus said how hardly shall a rich man enter in and and we find that that was the backdrop because now this is exactly what the the you know the disciples Peter comes to him and says Lord we have surrendered everything because they just heard him say it's hard for a rich man he he can hardly get in and all seems impossible but With God all things are possible and Peter comes with that great question Lord what what about us uh you know we we have left everything to follow you what will there be for us and of course that rich young man that was his problem he he wouldn't leave his possessions he couldn't give up his life and that's what Jesus was calling for Jesus didn't didn't wasn't necessarily calling him to go live in poverty because rich men generally when they go broke they get rich again they just have a knack for doing it and Jesus is just the problem is not the money the problem's in his heart you understand that his heart he's got a heart problem and he won't let the heart the greatest heart surgeon in the world fix it see and so they're saying Lord you know we we have we have forsaken everything and and and he wouldn't forsake his possessions but we we have forsaken ours we have forsaken all and the Lord From There goes into a very lengthy explanation about how there would there would actually be a complete uh renewal the Greek word means a rebirth and the ages to come don't worry that there's going to be a rebirth in the ages to come and and though the nation of Israel was at that time rejecting um his offer of the Kingdom the kingdom would still come it wasn't going to stop it Israel would be restored and they would be re-established as the leading Kingdom of Earth uh with Jerusalem literally being the capital city of the great king the king of kings so that was a coming in future ages and so the when you when you go on to understand it it's going to be a complete a complete remaking of all things that's what you're headed for friends that's what we're Believers for it's a and in fact is I'm not going to take the time to go into Isaiah 4 and Isaiah 5 and 11 and 10 and 32 and 35 what I and and Matthew 25 revelation 22 there's all kinds of places I could go today I'm going to save some time but we find out that it's a it's a remaking of all things that are spiritual all things that are all things political all things geographical all things physical and then when that's restored Christ will sit on the throne over it all you got that brother Branham and brother branham's language he would say it like this and I love his language the best he said over there all wrongs will be made right I take tremendous comfort in that so many times more times perhaps not a great amount of times but more times than I would want because one time is one time too many but numerous times I've sat in my office in this one or at my home or overseas abroad or at another church somewhere here counseling talking to people and their life has been so upended because they made the wrong choices and they went the wrong way and they went against the word of God and though the word of God pleaded with them not to it preachers pleaded with them and parents pleaded with them and People Prayed for them but they were they were caught under the magic spell of Satan and they went the way of the world and now they're sitting across from me weeping real tears because the agony of their life and what they're having to deal with in their life now and it's broken and busted and ruined and contaminated and sometimes sometimes we can as a minister of the Gospel we can find the way out I can say take hope friends because all you have to do you that's not you're not too late we can get that fixed it's going to take a little time it's going to take some work and you're gonna have to be diligent and the medicine might be a little bitter and it's going to have some side effects but we can get it fixed calm down let's hope in Christ but there's too many time more times than I'm ever comfortable with when really the only thing I can say to them because it's so broken and it's so ruined and it's so contaminated the only thing I can say and thank God I have it thank God I have it I can say well sister dear brother dear married couple elderly teenager say somebody can be ruined that early you better believe it and I've had that comfort that one Comfort it's just a one line and I can say well a prophet said all wrongs will be made right over there and I wish I had more of an answer normally there's more of an answer but you have went against God's word for so long in so many different ways but but let me give you this little trinket of Hope all wrongs will be made right serve God live humble carry on God will take care of you he'll help you you're not Beyond Redemption thank God you're not Beyond hope as long as Christ sits on the throne you're not Beyond hope there's always hope as long as Jesus is on the throne all wrongs will be made right over there the disciples were promised that they would have a very special place in the Kingdom that would actually sit on 12 Thrones judging the tribes of Israel in fact he said all who leave their homes and even if you have to forsake relatives and loved ones and and all and and forsake everything for the Lord's sake you know it's it's just like the marriage vow and how many times I've stood and said to a man and said to a woman and repeat after me and forsaking all others cleave to thee only all the days of my life and that's really what it comes down to when you come to Christ you're saying I will forsake I forsake all others and I will cleave only to you Lord Jesus for as long as we both shall live and thank God that's a very long time and and so Jesus assures them that that if they forsake everything for his kingdom that they would receive blessings on the other side that will more than compensate for any losses and that's on that's on top of their eternal life that's that's stacked on top not just eternal life but blessings that will more than comp compensate for whatever you've surrendered here and why while it while it might appear you know a lot of times while it might appear that the family of God is giving up everything everything now and we always seem to be saying well I I'm always in last place I'm always you know this Christianity but but I'm here to tell you in eternity you'll be first don't let the devil the Bible says don't be weary and well doing don't let the devil discourage you with life because this life ain't all there is I can tell you like the queen of the South and like Rahab there's more there's more to be had and this ain't all there is thank God world coming friends and God is rebuilding Eden but he's got to rebuild you first he's got he's got the second Adam rebuilt now he's rebuilding the second Eve see and so this this this principle I wanna I wanna come to this point before I close just want to make this last Point you're good so this principle runs all through the Bible it the first shall be last and last shall be first that didn't suddenly become true when Jesus said it Jesus was simply stating what had been a principle since Genesis and you find that you see it in Rahab I mean if you ever want a case of the last thing first go to rehab and so so you find that that Rahab we can see it working perfectly she's a perfect example of the Christ line remember I told you about the Christ line and the genealogies she's a perfect example of that Christ line scattered throughout Humanity that came from the fall in Genesis and when the sons of God saw the daughters of men and took unto them wives and brother Branham says that was the sons of Seth who married the daughters of Cain and and it intermingled the the the the gene pool of God's family from Adam with the gene pool from The Serpent and and therefore they're there for you you can see it it makes it survives the flood it comes out on the other side of the flood it's still going strong you still have those two Vines still have the Christ line and the Antichrist line you got me so so so so you find that that you've got this this this this this Christ line that goes through of which Rahab is now a perfect example of the Christ line that's been scattered through all the populations because she's not part of Israel she's a gentile of Jericho see it's not a Jew at all but yet she's a Christ line she's in she actually is going to end up marrying General an Israeli Army General by the name of salmon and then they're going to have a son and a son and a son and a son and finally you're going to get you're going to get Ruth and Boaz and you're going to keep going and you're going to get Jesse and you're going to get David you're going to get Jesus so God what was God doing he was taking the chaos of her sin birth and he was putting her back in the line of his word and that's exactly what has happened to you and to me we were in every nation and every culture and every race and every Creed and every organized thing and maybe your church was a bar room or maybe it was a Crystal Cathedral but we were lost and undone without God or his son when he reached way down for me and he brings you are you up out of chaos God finds a way to redeem he did it all down through history we see the same God doing the same thing today we see it in Genesis we see it in Rahab in the Book of Joshua there there truly is Friends listen now there truly is brother random called it a continuation of the book of Acts right so you say well what's the primary brother Jason Give me the give me the the primary purpose of a continuation of the book of Acts well it's varied okay but I just want the primary one I get that it might have all kinds of other things well it does it it has signs and wonders and gifts and to the church and miracles and power and things like that but you say but what was the primary what's the primary when brother Branham says what's the primary purpose when brother Branham says that we're writing another book of Acts behind it that you're you're this church under this message is a continuation of the book of Acts what does that really mean well in order to know what that really means in a restoration we've got to go back to what it was when it first came and I can tell you when it first came it was it it it was not it was not uh I don't want to be careful how I say this it was not primarily the introduction of signs and wonders and Gifts in operation you know nor this might shock you but it wasn't even primarily to correct erroneous doctrines that's not what it's for today it does do that it does restore signs and wonders and power it does correct erroneous teaching but that's never been the primary purpose of the Jubilee see while these things are all tangible parts of it they're not the primary purpose when we say a continuation of the book of Acts the main function of the continuation of the book of Acts is finding and redeeming Adam's lost family that's that's the that's why the book of Acts was a continuation of the Gospel what was Jesus doing coming to entertain him with signs and wonders and miracles and feed them no it wasn't running a social program he was looking for the children of God he was looking for his family Jesus came to save his own I'm here to tell you today we have a continuation of the book of Acts but it's not just to bring signs and wonders and miracles though it does those things it's not just to give us correct Doctrine which it does that but it's to take the chaos that you were born in and speak to a seed and bring a life and restore you back into the line of Christ to bring your life back to the line and the Order of God's word that's the primary thing that's being described in a continuation of the book of Acts because when that happens it doesn't matter where you've been doesn't matter what you've done or what condition he finds you in when he finds you he's going to save you he's going to redeem you and he's going to restore everything is restored back to this bride that sin took from her everything friends that's the beauty of the message of restoration it restores everything Jesus even talks about that in the gospels that he didn't he didn't just come to restore people he came to restore everything everything that you were ever supposed to be that Satan has taken from you I'm here to tell you there's a message today that gives it back to you it puts it right back in your life no matter what condition no matter what position I mean if if you think about it when when God was going to send out the gospel what did you have you had it's like concentric Rings it started in Jerusalem and it you ever throw up a pebble into the middle of a pond and you see the concentric Rings just start going out like that and they go out in all directions it was going to start in Jerusalem it was going to go to Judea I was going to go to Samaria it's going to keep on going to the uttermost part of the earth it wouldn't matter how you see it wouldn't matter how how messed up you were or how messed up your life is you say oh brother Jason what is it what is it going to do to me when it when that when that Ripple reaches you say what is the message of the hour whatever we keep calling it a message of the hour because what he said was it's going to go Jerusalem Judea so Mary the uttermost part of the Earth right now that's that's geographically all right look at the spiritual side at first it just started preaching to Jews and you know what happened in the at the when they came out of the upper room they juice from all over the world who have been scattered all over the world but they were Jews heard every man in their own language so the first thing it did was at Jerusalem it reads started regathering just Jews from All Nations but then what do you find happening in the book of Acts then you find every once in a while you see suddenly you're getting people like Titus and Timothy who are half Jew half Gentile what's it doing it's spreading out and then finally it goes to the house of Cornelius and now it's all Gentiles not just half Gentiles all Gentiles and then finally it keeps on going and keeps on going till it's only to Gentiles and Israel is put aside and she's got to wait for a restoration when the bride is gone and now all it reached to all of his Gentile family who were intermingled around the world born in sin it covered two thousand years it covered seven Church ages and you say brother Jason what is the message of the hour the message of the hour is that ripple effect is now here it's now reached you it's reached me God has sent it to us and we we have a wonderful message and this is what it's done it's here now when it can't go there are no more ages there's no more once you go beyond the west coast of of the United States you're heading back East again there's no Jesus described it as the lightning coming out of the East traveling to the West so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and we're here and it's now and the wave has reached me the wave has reached you and we're at the finish line we're at the Finish Line friends this is not a time to let the chaos of the world continue to pull you and pull you over a cliff pull you into a world that's burning down around you Redemption is here Eden is being restored get on board Hallelujah get on board eating The Old Ship of Zionist headed home very soon I want that for my life I want that

thought about this in my when I was studying I didn't write it down but it just comes back to me brother Brandon said Satan listen now young people listen close Satan doesn't care how religious you are he doesn't care say well we've got the message we've got correct Doctrine he doesn't care how right you are in your doctor he knows here's what he knows he has a secret brother Ram said he knows

scripture verses that anyone who was ever baptized in the early church was baptized in the name of the Lord and at no time were they ever baptized using titles for about 300 years that's the first Trace they can even find of even anyone even suggesting that they do it otherwise than according to Acts chapter 2. that's a bona fide historical fact and the encyclopedias in the scripture proves it
