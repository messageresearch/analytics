TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e e e e e e e e e [Music] for [Music] good morning everyone God bless you we're going to continue on our subject this will be a word family part seven and uh we'll have I guess less of a PowerPoint this time but um want to continue on let's let's uh stand as we pray gracious Heavenly Father we just come before you Lord and we ask that your presence would be with us Lord that you would take your word Lord Make It Real to us make it alive to us Lord uh and help us to be conformed to what the word says not to what our thoughts our feelings or just a few steps behind what the world thinks Lord we commit our ourselves to You For Your Glory we ask it in Jesus name amen uh the first scripture we're going to turn to is in Malachi you can be seated is in Malachi chapter 2 and we're going to look at a few verses there as we turn there our brother Mark helps us get there kind of looking at some of the last few times we've done Sunday school just in a very brief before we start reading and kind of turn the subject a little bit it used to be where a man knew it was his job to protect his wife his daughters and a knew a woman knew it was her job to take care of her husband and her family this is should be for those who are readers of the Bible and Believers of the Bible such a basic truth it's almost as fun fundamental as simply believing that God exists amen if we believe that God exists we understand the order of the family and the Order of the home the pro the the let me before I get there because we have departed from this in our society what do we get now all honor respect dignity and modesty and the wisdom of Ages past has literally been thrown away to the point where you have to actually go and teach Christians again the first and very basics of these things and it becomes a shock to them many times and that's what you have under among so many different doctrines about ma manhood and Womanhood amongst all the denominational systems we've thrown it thrown all the constraints that the word of God puts upon us for our joy and His glory put that away and what are the results that we have we have a pornog Ric violent dishonorable danger Dangerous and evil culture that we're surrounded by and so when we when we lack this basic understanding uh it becomes it becomes a total perversion and secondarily is what we find many in the Christian world doing and it's a we can we can kid ourselves and think it's not a danger for us but what ends up happening is the world moves this way I'm going to use the left hand they move this way right and Christians go instead of saying this is God's unmovable unchangeable word I'm staying here and not moving from it they just go oh see I'm not as bad as them and you justify yourself in your own eyes and say we're we're doing it the right way when you're actually doing it not you're doing it the wrong way you're not staying on the immovable Rock of God's word you're sliding away and then comparing yourself with those who are evil degenerates and saying oh I'm better than them the standard is not better than them the standard is God's unchangeable word and his unchangeable purpose for us as individuals and anytime you deviate that the prophet taught us this anytime you deviate from the original word you're walking in perversion so justifying yourself that we're not as bad as the rest of them is not an answer that God is going to accept on the white at the white Throne judgment absolutely unacceptable excuse to say you know we've adjusted ourselves we've come we've come to the left on these issues we've moved to the left but we're still further to the right than the rest well I'd rather just stand here as a complete radical based solely upon God's word alone amen and whatever the consequences that the world wants to give to me I'm sorry I'm standing on God's word if it hurts your feelings if it hurt if it makes you emotional if it makes you want to march in the streets and show that prove that you're an unbeliever go ahead but here we stand we can do no other all right Malachi chapter 2 and we'll start at Reading at verse 14 yet ye say wherefore because the Lord has been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou Hast dealt treacherously I want to pause and emphasize that word for a moment because you're going to see it come up again treacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy Covenant so understand that marriage is actually a covenant amen between a man and a woman and they become husband and wife and they're they're they're therefore joined in a union and they're properly referred to as a companion right and to to go against your companion to go against the Covenant is to automatically deal treacherously in other words there is a debt of Allegiance and responsibility that a husband has to a wife and a wife has to a husband and when you don't fulfill that it is committing treason against the Covenant verse 15 and did not he make one yet had he the residue of the spirit so in other words he's saying he made husband and wife one he joined them together in the union and in that Union it was God that has the residue of the spirit he is the one by his spirit that joined man and woman together so when he joined Adam and Eve together what did he do he actually was showing what the rest of marriages is when a man and woman is joined together in a solemn vow before God in a covenant entering into a covenant together that he actually it's God himself that's joining the man and the woman together in that Covenant so the residue of the spirit is the one that's joining the two together just the same as he did with Adam and Eve verse 16 for the Lord the god of Israel oh go back to verse 15 I I didn't finish reading and wherefore one so why did he make them one why did he make them one that he might seek a Godly seed so there's a union there's a covenant there's a companionship and what did God make them one for to multiply and fill up the Earth but not just with humans that wasn't God's purpose he wanted to fill it up with a Godly seed so the function and if we can understand this the function and purpose of the marriage covenant is to produce a Godly seed this is God's purpose and God's program within that Covenant so if you produce an ungodly seed we're failing in the purpose amen of course we must do our part the rest is up to God we can't give the baptism of the Holy Ghost to their CH to our children you can raise Godly you can do every step correctly in your home and produce a child that Rebels against almighty God because that's the nature of every one of us until we get the Holy Ghost and our Nature has changed but you should at least do your job and your duty to raise Godly seed amen because at at least in that place you can meet the Lord and say I've done honorably by my family I've raised them right I left them in your hands Lord you have actually promised me that if I did that they would eventually come back to the way that they were trained in so I'm holding you accountable father Amen to bring my children into the Covenant that they were born in then then the the pro the Lord speaking by the prophet says therefore take heed to your spirit that you deal not treacherously there's that word again you have wearied the Lord with your words verse 17 yet ye say wherein have we wearied him when you say everyone that do does evil is good in the sight of the Lord and He delighteth in them where is the god of judgment amen all right so God hates divorce because it's the breaking of a covenant that he has made between husband and wife that's from the end of verse 16 God hates putting away let's go back to 16 cuz again I started expositing on it and skipped over 3ars of it the god of Israel saith that he hateth putting away for one coverthe the Lord of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that you deal not treacherously so the ultimate treason of marriage is divorce is when the marriage covenant is broken Now understand that this isn't you have you have to understand that when a man man abuses his wife he's actually breaking his marriage covenant he's broken it if his wife leaves she's justified in leaving because he himself has violated his duty of marriage amen so you have to understand that there is more to being treacherous than just divorce twice in this these series of verses God says men have dealt treacherously with their wives instead of dealing with that with them as your with your companion and one whom you have entered into a covenant with you are dealing treacherously with her treacherous means to betray a trust or to violate an allegiance it speaks of neglect of your duties towards the Covenant you have entered into with your wife the Bible speaks of many duties of a man to his wife and again these we we we think as modern people duty this is your duty we immediately think oh that's not a good thing let's understand it this way Brothers you sisters your your duty should be your Delight if you have the Holy Ghost your you joyfully enter into your duty right it isn't a difficult thing now it can become a difficult thing um if you're deal sometimes you're dealing with difficult people sometimes you're dealing with a difficult husband a difficult wife nevertheless your faith should be connected to God in such a way that you understand even as a as a husband your wife is behaving the wrong way your duty is to God yeah amen as a wife if your husband is behaving in a certain way again your duty is to God you don't have neither none of us have a right to disobey God because our husband is behaving wrong now again we have boundaries we've mentioned abuse before you don't let anyone abuse you amen either side verbally emotionally physically amen you remove yourself from the situation and that's wisdom and that in itself is loving God because God asks us to tell people no to tell to to tell people stop to not allow them to force you into something that is ungodly uh you know the scripture says wives obey your husbands in the Lord right so if your husband is telling you to do something that's contrary to the word you don't owe obedience to your husband your obedience to God and the vice versa goes if a if a man is being uh forced and nagged by his wife into doing something ungodly he he he is Duty bound before God to correct her and to say no and back away but the the there in Exodus 21:10 it shows us that a man has a duty to provide food clothing and the duty of marriage to his wife the duty of marriage of course speaks of the cohabitation or conjugal rights of the marriage bed and so when men begin to neglect these obligations that they have towards their wife it creates a situation where wives will then be are being injured by their husbands perhaps not physically but they're being they're they're receiving a a spiritual and a moral injury by their husbands and what ends up happening with this is a woman will become resentful of her husband when he is not performing the duties that God has obligated him to and when she becomes resentful more than likely uh she'll either emotionally check out of the marriage or she will become his worst nightmare it's sin in men to neglect their wives it's sinful we have to be sure that we understand that it's sinful for women to resent and to nag their husbands I have scripture we'll go through it both of these sides but but but the real thing is that men are tending towards neglecting their wives both literally and emotionally yeah and this is a great danger um it even speaks of be not bitter against them and we'll cover that as we get let go go later in this but at the center of marriage is two people who have a sinful nature in them therefore we understand that repentance is an important part of marriage oh yeah we can't minimize sin amen we can't say oh it's not that big of a deal I didn't mean to we can't take that attitude you might have not meant to but you still did it therefore whether you meant to or not is Irrelevant in the sight of man therefore repentance is required and if if we forget this part we become proud men men have a huge tend everyone does but especially men have a tendency towards pride and arrogance and they don't want to be corrected and they don't want to repent but a real man will repent and ask for forgiveness from his wife if he sins if he doesn't perform the duties that God has placed upon Him correctly or he does them with the wrong attitude it's necessary to repent for a wife she can't she also needs to repent if she's nagging him continuously as the Bible says like a continual dropping upon him um if she is being loud boisterous rude to him well she needs to repent also it's sin in her she can't can't say well my husband didn't do this that might be true but you did this and therefore you're wrong and you must repent and it's between you and you and God your husband also will answer too if he's the if he's the cause of it you'll answer and he'll answer if he's not performing his duties and you're becoming resentful and nagging well you're going to answer for being resentful and nagging and he's going to answer for neglecting you and for causing you to be neglectful amen and nagging well amen anyway Proverbs 12:4 by now you should show up and and be able to uh take it on the chin from my Sunday schools I'm taking it too Proverbs 12:4 a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband amen a virtuous woman is one that follows the order of the family and home that God has laid out walking in obedience to God and her husband fulfilling her duties that God has assigned her as a wife and mother and keep her at home with the fruit of the spirit and also keeping those three sacred trusts in order in her own life oh the verse goes on but she makes a shame be she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness to his bones yes am an immodest woman that is loud rude would as brother brandham said would rather have a dog or a cat to raise than children says my husband must obey me I'm taking these from quotes I don't obey him he must obey me this woman is rottenness in his bones and he would be ashamed because of her her behavior would bring shame upon him in the sight of the public Proverbs 18:22 who so findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtains favor of the Lord a sign of God's favor on a man's life is when he finds a Godly wife it shows the priorities are correct remember brother branam instructs you should be looking for character in The choosing of a bride not with whether they're pretty first look at their character and they're the kind of person that you want to build a home around and he says and then after that if she's pretty it's not a prior that should not be your first line of priority because if your first line of priority is physical Beauty what are you what are you going to get you don't know you don't know there's no guarantee on that God might work a miracle but I I wouldn't count on our stupidity causing a miracle I would look for character I would look for a a young lady that is working towards fulfilling the three sacred trusts that of a woman that brother brandham speaks about that would be the that would be the first priority and secondarily it would be the leading of the holy spirit so first of all it has to be the right type of young lady and vice versa has to be right type of young man if you're if the young ladies are looking to young man that are come coming to to court them they should think how does he treat his mother how does he treat uh his sisters am that's right uh he should look and say she should look and say what kind of work ethic does he have what kind of strength does he have is he is he a weakling does he not have uh be able to take any kind of spiritual leadership or authority is there any sign of that so you should be looking first for character because it's uh he that finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor of the Lord but we we have scripture to show us that if you find an ungodly woman you find the worst thing you find rottenness for your bones rottenness in Bones means there's no structure there's there's no there's no order to your body you're just droopy and and weak and it's a horrible thing and so young women look for character amen young men look for character secondly find the leadership of the holy spirit in your own personal life and young ladies of course many times we forget to mention this but the scripture shows that your father is supposed to be involved in your dating life am seek the counsel first of your father about this young man your emotions might be swayed in a thousand different ways but I'm pretty sure your dad's emotions won't be and that is that's why it's critical and that's why the scripture puts forth a father as the deciding factor in the home and in the family Proverbs 19: 13- 14 a foolish son is a is the Calamity of his father and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping house and riches are in the inheritance of fathers and a Prudent Wife is from the Lord so house and riches inherited by sons comes from Godly fathers yeah uh I think the scripture says a good man lays up an inheritance for his children's children but then on the vice versa a foolish son is the Calamity of his father look at look at David I think he produced a few foolish Sons why because he was the scripture even tells us he was afraid to displease them he didn't want to displease them well dads I'm going to tell you right now you got to spend a lot of time displeasing your children if you want to produce good ones amen as we understand too much if you too much good for your children spoils them and produces Calamity the Calamity of his father right Absalom is a perfect example he refused to correct Absalom didn't want to displease Absalom what was the results of that his own son supplanted him and even took his concubines to shame him this is a Calamity of of David from his his desire to not displease his sons we have to displease our children amen we have to bring them bad news sorry we're taking your phone away sorry you're grounded sorry you're getting a spanking they need they kids need boundaries and they need correction and without them they will be monsters praise the Lord amen all right that's Fathers and Sons um and then he speaks in the same verses of wives so the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping so what does that mean it's referring to a house that is in dis disrepair so this house is in disrepair and as a result you have water leaking on your head from the rain that is coming in outside so there's a contentious wife and when there's a contentious wife what is the results what is the results it's a it shows that there's a house in disrepair amen it shows that it's open to the elements of Evil coming in to the home so many times if you realize that a wife is a reflection of her husband he's the image of God she's the image of man therefore we're men men are a reflection of God As Leaders in the home and women are a reflection of men as helpers in the home so if she is contentious it's not 100% true all the time sometimes a woman is just contentious for whatever reason perhaps she was um mistreated uh in her life and she fears to trust a man and she feels that she must control him whatever whatever the reason might be it shows a home that's out of order and in disrepair and it becomes a continual dropping upon the head of a man and again if if we understand the marriage relationship a husband will answer for his wife amen a husband will answer for the atmosphere that he has in his home the wife will secondarily but the husband is responsible for that God places the responsib responsibility squarely upon him so he must solve this problem in his home of a contentious wife by first fixing himself so that this contentious woman will give him a moment of Peace because he's living in such a way that she honors and respects him now she should repent and stop being a contentious woman even if he is an orinary mean jerk of a man because she will answer to God for her own behavior but it's if we understand as Christians as real men of God it's our duty to set the atmosphere of our home it's our duty to correct our wife and our children and to set things in order and do it in a way right amen that's not abusive not harmful but is with love and spiritual growth at the center of all of it and the second part is the blessing is a Prudent Wife a wife with wisdom a wife with faith a wife that is not fearful of the times to come as Proverbs said but trusts in God now that is a gift from the Lord the Lord has sent that woman to you as a blessing to help you to strengthen you and to Stand By Your Side amen praise the Lord Proverbs 7: 11 speaking of the ungodly woman she's loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house 1 Peter 3 shows us that the proper adornment of a sister is a Meek and quiet Spirit Meek does not speak of being weak right though she is the weaker vessel God doesn't ordain that women be weak amen not be weak in faith and not be weak in body just weaker than men right in in comparison Meek doesn't speak of that it speaks of something different remember that we Moses was the meekest man upon all the Earth why was he the meekest man because he was the most easily led by the Lord and and meekness speaks as she's willing to be led and God has built this into the nature of a woman is a it is a desire to be led by a Godly Man and the next part of it is a quiet spirit so these things like Proverbs 711 is the antithesis of what God desires from the character of a woman he doesn't want her adorning to be loud and stubborn and to not abide in her house he desires that she have a Meek and a quiet Spirit it says in the sight of God it is of Great Value this attitude this attribute is of Great Value not being loud and stubborn but having that Meek and quiet spirit Colossians 3:19 husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them I've got to close even if your wife tries to control you and nag you it's your obedience to God not to be bitter against your wife as as a godly man you can't respond to other people in kind you respond as God leads you and speaks to you and deals with you all right so bitterness towards your wife speaks of literally
