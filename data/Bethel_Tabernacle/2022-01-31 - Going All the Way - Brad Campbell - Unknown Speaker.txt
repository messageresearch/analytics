TRANSCRIPT
========================================
started on this journey many years ago [Music] i've seen a lot of things [Music] while traveling to and from [Music] well i've been through the storm [Music] i've been through the rain [Music] and sometimes all i try to do it just seems to be in vain but one thing i know for sure i'm gonna get my starry crown [Music] cause i've done come this far [Music] and i just can't turn around with the things i have to do [Music] you may not understand [Music] but my main concern that i'm in the master's plan [Music] [Music] well i could care less [Music] what the world may do or say [Music] cause i've made the lord a promise that if he would lead the way i told him i'd follow and after all that i've been through i'd be a fool to turn it loose and let it all go down cause i've made up in my mind but i'm going all the way listen to these words satan comes around [Music] playing with my mind [Music] but i've got a job to do i can't afford to waste my time where he pretends to be my friend and he pretends to be so kind [Music] forget behind me saturday [Music] my [Music] i'm going all the way singing with me now thank you lord oh i could kill this [Applause] what the world may do or say cause i've made the lord a promise that if he would lead the way i told he might follow and after all that i've been through i'd be a fool to turn it loose and let it all go now [Applause] cause i've made up in my mind i'm going all the way i'm going all the way i'm going all the way [Applause]
