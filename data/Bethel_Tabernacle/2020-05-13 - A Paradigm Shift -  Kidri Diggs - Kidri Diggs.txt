there for we know that you are omnipresent Lord you're omniscient all-knowing God following section move by your spirit in the name of Jesus Christ we pray the church a man a man if you have your Bibles let's turn to the Book of Luke the fifth chapter Luke chapter five a man I covet your prayers tonight Luke chapter 5 let's start reading at verse 17 the Bible says and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out to every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was present to heal them and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy and and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went up on the housetop and led him down through the thing which his couch unto the mist before Jesus and when he saw their faith he said unto them man thy sins are forgiven thee a man may Lord bless me knows where you can have your seats amen tonight by the grace of God the Lord the Lord's just been kind of dealing with me you know with my thought process you know with with my mind and how I perceive things and and just making sure I'm not living by fear you know because we know the Bible says that perilous times will come but the thing of it is how do we react in those perilous times knowing that God told us it was going to happen you know and tonight my topic is the believers mindset you know one thing about a believer we should believe at all times amen no matter what's taking place there should be something in us that just kicks in and say well God said this and this is where I'm standing hallelujah and you know we just can't quite get away from you know the time we're in with this pandemic and quarantine and all these things but if I can be honest Church to me it's just the devil making up more names hallelujah that's how I feel about it you know because once the the the system of whoever it is once they came out and made the statement I said uh-huh once they came out and see the devil has a problem with people that no God is healer he has a problem with people who live by that witness of what he did in their lives because they have those sickness and all these things with the mind of a believer oh yeah so you already into to certain characteristics but when they came out and everything to talk about the depend emic in the quarantine or whatever you call it the virus code 19 when they came out they said they're expecting the second wave in September I'm like how can you expect the second wave of a virus unless you doing something to make it move that way haruya nobody can predict when somebody's gonna get sick huh unless you doing something to make them sick oh yeah so in my mind I'm saying the devil is up to something so Church we are to be holy steadfast on the Word of God we ought to know that oh yeah that a lot of times when things happen is more spiritually natural hey man that the enemy is up the southern end and whenever the prophet of God will say he said that uh when you can see the devil unleashed and ranting and raging you better believe God is unleash also but you know Church when I look and I think about our mind sensing and our sauce the perfect God he said you are what your thoughts are oh yeah and when it comes to the life you live a lot of times you are what's your thoughts in the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he we can't get away from that husband you know uh probably amen you know our sitting I was thinking about this particular thing right here the salt process you know it brought me to a particular word honey a particular phrase Amen how many knows what it means to have a paradigm shift and I just want to give you the salt behind that a paradigm shift a paradigm shift means a fundamental change in approach or underlining assumptions hugs so you changed the way you approach when the paradigm begins to shift on in church in this our whole you got to change the way you think honey you can't see the way you saw earlier yesteryear because things are intensifying amen so you got to have a deeper experience with God hurting your mind hallelujah your spirit hallelujah he has to be under control of the Holy Ghost because these are shifting and if you're not conscious enough you're going to shift but with a takes place hozier a lot of times hey man let's just say in a natural it's the devil doing something but that doesn't take away that God is still present so you have to watch how things are shifting and keep your testimony hardly you know as I look and I begin to think about amen the paradigm and how things are shift you know this whole thing is all about producing fear you got people now then it's back slid they read their Bibles again they they they even streaming some of the churches but is that coming from a desire from God or is that coming from fear honey see the paradigm harlot it's shifting and it's making them question where they go oh yeah it's making them question hurry up if this thing honey was to get ahold of me will I die hallelujah but you can't serve God because you're afraid of death honey you have to serve God because you love him huh that is the believers mind we worship because we love him we serve him because we love him we're here tonight because we love him not because we drew straws or different things took place we're here tonight because we love God Hurley you know I begin to think Hurley what happens to some animals when they're afraid when some animals are free and you were just taking an animal he's going out to hunt hey man it never comes a paradigm seems Hurley maybe one of his enemies is not there in the same place so what can he do there's a dynamic about some animals that was fear and things change Hurley they begin to camouflage themselves what is making that camouflage either they're hiding to pounce or they're hiding because of fear right now there's a lot of camouflage Saints around about there's a lot of people who you who are camouflaged some of them look like they're still a part of the church and some of them are sitting there can't wait to the opportunity so they can quit Church Harley because of a pen gimmick and always some people happy they can stay home some people are hoping the church never opens back up because they don't have a desire so you have to be careful when the paradigm comes Harley because when the paradigm comes the real you will come out with these begin to shift the real you will come out earlier and you normally begin to do what's in your mind first you take that animal that's being hunted you he'll go to a certain surroundings or an environment and he'll try to camouflage himself to sit there but you know what he's still the same animal nothing about him changes he still has the the same fear hallelujah he still has the same coat he still has all the same genetics a man but what is changing him fear in a lot of people are afraid oh yeah because I was taking place Church a couple of weeks ago this was the first trip I did since all these things taking place I went in the airport it almost felt like a third-world country people walk around with masks on and and all these things and I'm like what day what are we gonna do when they say okay everything can go back to normal how many people are going to be able to go back to normal that's the question can we go back to normal can't we come to church hurry can I come to church this church and shake brother Jason hands and don't think about the pandemic can I come in and say god bless you brothers give you hope and not think about a virus worry yourself be with the paradigm shifts Chloe will you still be operating on the fear or will you say this is who I am this is who I am I'm a believer hallelujah I believe in Jesus Christ he's the giver of all life hurry hurry but you know this church hallelujah we have people sitting right among us holy and they don't believe happy there's no church happy that we have live streaming in the homes happy pick up the computer or whatever and go to church that's all right oh yeah but I know this church see you have to catch the shift because when things shift it be the devil shipping you away from God if you're not careful now I'm not saying God doesn't have his hand in things to hurry because sometimes in times like this God challenges us to see where our mindset is he challenges us to see where we are spiritually hardly so I wonder how many people are in battle tab on heaven Jesus Christ having all the different Tabernacles I'm gonna be busting the door down to get back in and worship you said Briggs why do you say that because the paradigm is trying to shift us away from gathering when the Bible says when we see these things we ought to gather them all so we gonna believe you believe the quarantine or even believe what the Bible says something my pastor said when it's all first started and it stuck with me until this day he was preaching and he he made a statement he said Saints we don't come to church ain't gonna close the doors unless they make me close the doors but we're gonna try to the best we can to obligate whatever Caesar saying he said but I want you to understand one thing if God can't protect us in church where can he protect us people come to church all afraid oh I guarantee you right now if I come up cleaning steam by hand you have a thought you will have a whole little salt you have a quarantine salt because that's where we have shifted so what's gonna what's gonna get you back where you need to be you have to stay with the Word of God oh yeah the Word of God is the only thing that can put us back on track oh yeah in church when I look at I think about animals that camouflage as soon as soon as the trouble is gold they go back to their natural color look at holy look at the church 911 and passing out Bibles and Billy Graham and all these people having Crusades and everything oh let's have a prayer and a look at New York now it's back to whatever it was it's back to heaven ride the underwear in the subway they the believers mind said don't get caught up in the paradigm because things are shifting but for us they're shifting closer to God early church I know without a shadow of a doubt for the believers God is building character I don't know about you but God even he even made me question my own experience clothes grain which is all first started earlier I caught the fruit there was an old boy you got it you got it all you you coronavirus Karuna behinds are you come on I betcha we can special virus never heard of it before lying devil made a virus out the hacker holic drink you know what the enemy what happened I went and worked out and I'm sure this has happened to somebody before I went and worked out and South Carolina I loved it hallelujah but we got the craziest weather on or on earth honey you know one minute it's hot one minute it's cold honey so one one morning I was working out real early and I and I and I went out the gym with no jacket on and I was wet honey and then my sweat got cold and they say you know I got a fever Church I didn't get a call I didn't get a runny nose I didn't get any other symptoms but a fever and you know the enemy tried to do he tried to get in my mind they said yeah that's that's one that's one of the clear signs that you got it a fever you need to get some mama and take your temperature but y'all knowing me I told the devil shut up I don't have anything I'm gonna fight honey so you know what I did I put bro clothes on sweating out a man sweating it out but one thing haruya about the flu it don't give up easy it'll make you think it's good and then it'll come back honey I wonder how many people thought that they were where they were supposed to be and found out that they were lacking a whole lot knocking the whole lot and God allowed the pandemic to take place so you can see where you are before the rapture he allowed us holy some of us honey to feel fear and incomplete no least ease why so we can crowd because God knew what our mindset was a man church my daughter came over said I was my big girl she came over oh yeah cuz she's fixed that I wasn't telling the truth huh see what's in your mind were you going through stuff one thing the enemy ain't gonna get from me he ain't gonna get a confession that he's doing something you know the greatest battle ever fought is where and the prophet of God says when it comes to sickness where does it come from he says it's a spirit before it becomes a disease and you have to accept that spirit in your mind before it develops in your body and once you accept it in your mind you make it live because your mind is a womb hallelujah hey man your wounds are proper God said your mind holy is the gateway to the soul can you think about that you create life in your thoughts I give you a prime example you wake up believe you coming down with you'd open the gate it's coming now what is gonna be named is up to you because you could be confident coughing coughing coughing holy but until you accept the salt it could just be leading you through it could just be dust honey but what can dust do to you nothing but once you say oh I'm catching a cold you better believe you gonna catch it you didn't open the gate how through your thoughts you gave it nice hug Oh what is the believers Minds just like we can give her the carnal things life we should be able to give the spiritual beach life by confessing truth amen by confessing regards chance God says I'm the head and the tail why can't I believe that and confess it and watch it materialize in my life that's a beauty believe was mine oh yeah you know like I said I was fighting and fighting you know my daughter came over with some medicine and when she came over but Jason I had on another t-shirt I have on my thermal over that I had on my hoodie and I had my water cooler she look at me and say daddy you see you know I'm good the hood sauce she was judging how I feel about what she saw you know a lot of times your eyes can't tell the truth honey sometimes you can see something you know I preached in our church honey I put a pitch up and I said hey you know we say a picture's worth a thousand words right now we say a picture's worth a thousand words that we believe that that's Jesus in the original rule pictures worth a thousand words amen we look at it and say yeah I see that that's what it is but think about this honey what good is a picture without the right content everything behind that thing is just your fault without the right content you could be believing a lot oh yeah but you're judging it by your eyesight no you don't live by your mind oh yeah trust God dealing with your heart cuz your mind can get confused cuz it is a battleground that's why he said there's this mind that was in Christ being you but you know she came in and she had some different medicine and all these things you know as time progressed she said she said you know the devil's telling me say hey you need to UM I guess the momma then take your to nothin right cuz then it'll show that I'm believing what he's saying in my head don't you know the devil started you Hill puts up in your head and you keep thinking and thinking about and then you gonna do it so you don't know what's in your heart huh but what he's trying to do is get on this battleground and make you go through the actions that's what he did that's what he did was Eve the prophet of God said she committed adultery first up here think she went but when he came to a believer hurry up when it came to Adam he couldn't even approach why because I was mine was steadfast on God he knew better so you know I felt the salt in one night I was laying in the bed I knew I was burning I mean I said bright I mean wow I'm burnin up laying in the bed undercover with all these clothes on you know those words was enough power to back the devil up honey he said the wicked Christians only needs can't defeat the devil anytime anyplace anywhere honey you just got the Hallelujah have the right confession he I might have told you this testimony before but it was a sister hallelujah Amen who who don't know we know but she committed adultery and the woman she husband she committed adultery honey she believed in witchcraft huh so she went to the voodoo doctor and told her told him I want you to kill this woman who spit on my luck he said he said no problem I need my $5,000 he was proven from doing spells and everything he said give me five thousand US and I do it she said okay I'm gonna do it without she's walking out she saying by the way she's supposed to be a Christian my not do it for free I'll kill her for free so he got to mixing up his posters and doing all this stuff huh a week later the lady was still living opposed to be dead so the woman came back and she said hey she's still alive we started saying let me tell you I was doing what I normally do and I got a visitation from my boss one of the chief demons he said I got a visitation and he told me leave her alone because she's already repented oh the devil knows he can't touch you when you are - the blood he knows what you ask God for forgiveness he has to leave you alone unless you accept that you feel guilty then we will and these animals camouflage themselves utterly the midst of trouble listen but they don't change her every quality remains in it earlier it just learns to adapt to its environment church clothes wow we're adapting let's not forget that we ride while we're adapting Hullinger there's something going on behind the scenes I don't think they looking at who stopped Church all together and who's doing everything they can do to keep it going don't think they watching it honey don't think they check it out who still streaming in who's still coming in all these things hurry cuz you know what they got to have hurry a clue of who's gonna receive the mark of the beast see ain't it ain't so much for denominations they're like praise God they just go in and shut down no they're gonna get a big old fat check from that stimulus so they gladly do it cuz they know they're gonna be taken care but for those of us who do this because we love God we worrying about the tiling we worried about the money and all these different things we do because we love God and we want to have the people in a in a Christian godly atmosphere Holly will only connect you to the love of God you look different but a man but church look at the believers mindset now God was he was in a home teaching the preaching and the Bible said that honey his presence was daring healings there so these brothers they gathered up one of their brothers Harley they probably couldn't touch him because it's a quarantine so they had him on a cot couldn't go through the crowd it was too many people honey he meant but I wanted to hurry that if this place wasn't crowded out in the midst of the quarantine would you try to make your way in would you say gay brother Jason to call but you know better you can't have all the many people here like this you know you heard what they said just follow me just follow we know we have certain protocols and things but just follow me I want to deal with your mind because when the enemy is trying to get us to do to live in fear try to live in fear when we come to church just imagine somebody start shouting and they just touch you in you are you gonna have to do every time we shake hands sister we got the sanitary any little sanitizer in the world to keep all his clean like that but I'll tell you one thing earlier that's enough confession of the blood of Jesus Christ to keep them demons back honey there are demons lingering whether we know it or not hallelujah you know and me and somebody else was talking okay yeah you put the gloves on the CCC y'all forgive me cause this stuff is silly I'm not telling you not to be safe I'm just talking about for me you know but it's kind of silly to me because you say you put gloves on and you know and you got to don't touch this and don't touch that okay you take one glove off then what they and do that hand got to trust the gloves take it off and people think they're being protected the only way you can get that girl out without touching is doing some kind of way you got to use this free hand to get it off just free uncovers hands to get it off while you didn't walk around and touching all the stuff and I take it a step further huh you walk around with a man so how you gonna get the mask off without touching it you all ready to throw it a big old dog Vader man song don't forgive me but I let me see it i'ma say I'm your father we figure by the church you walk around with the mass song you got to touch the mash to take it off where is it am I making any sense I'm not telling you how to do what you do wherever your faith is hug it but one thing I want you to realize some things we declare to be faith we say we love God and we really don't you think God didn't have that setup you think God didn't allow that to get a hold of them because it was their time but you look at the believers faith you look at this this is man hallelujah these brothers say they come to the crowd and and there was social distancing they couldn't go through crowd and say you know what we're gonna go up on the roof look at their minds eat honey whatever we got to do we're gonna get our brother in the presence of the Lord in church that's I feel whatever I got to do I want to remain in his presence honey patty because no pandemic virus or no virus holy I wanna be with Jesus because he's the only one that can help me he's the only one that can strengthen me and save me honey Church they have been other killer viruses before those remember the pandemic call AIDS now it's just an afterthought usually nobody talking about let's be careful when things hit the paradigm and it's shifting you changed your approach watch it be careful because of this you don't change your approach to worship you people afraid to lift the hands because they take a virus on it gonna be in church like this I hope I'm making sister Church listen know how mind says think about where we are and how we talk to God and what we expect from God I want to read you a scripture that just blew me away let's go to job chapter 13 don't worry I'm bound by the coals Joel chapter 13 verse 18 listen what the Bible says this says behold I have or I have all of my calls I know that I shall be justified or meets you requests holy the Bible is telling us we have the power to request earlier what we stand in needling to says I all of my calls holier and I know that I shall be justified he's saying holier what I ask for I know I'm gonna receive we're in that time does your mind operate like that were you going to pray unto God and ex-con and you order your calls do you believe that you're justified in what you're asking and if you're justified God has to move on your behalf because when you speak he only hears his voice Wow you have the ability to make your child turn into what you wanted you I have ordered my calls honey I know that I shall be justified that jumped out to me because I was listening to a message and listen what the prophecies about Joel listen I have I have heard but now see 65 I got paragraph 27 let me help but it says but Satan thought he could twist him around a little bit and cuff him up and make him do it but you see see the devil thought he knew Joe's mind he thought he knew what Joe was thinking he said hey if I take his riches if I take his family if I take this I take that he will serving but job wasn't connected to his natural things he was connected to that sacrifice he was connected to that blood he said Joe with his oh my just doesn't so problem he says but you see job with this perfect revelation of God we can have a perfect revelation of God and I'll give you a clue of what it means to have a perfect revelation of God a perfect revelation of God is knowing like the Bible says that he is hallelujah he is whatever you need him to be you need him to be a healer he is a healer he either deliver hallelujah he is my hope he is my peace hallelujah that's a perfect revelation of God knowing that God can do anything and knowing that God does not change no matter what's going on on this earth this is a job with this perfect revelation of God in who God will see not only did he has a revelation he knew who God was so when things arose in his life he could look at that and judge it by his revelation and he could say that's not God or that is God she knew who God was come on somebody I hope you know who God is oh yeah he said in how God loves him see look at look at how the Prophet says you say he said he had a perfect revelation of God he knew who God was and how God loved him that's the biggest question people have today does God love me anybody going through something he says that's how God shows his love it's elected love if he loves you he allows you to go through a trial even though I already had testimonies of healing I had to fight the flu honey you know I talked about it after I came out cuz I wasn't going in the midst of the flu saying oh I got it because I would have made it stronger so what I did I kept cast it down till one day oh yeah I broke out it was good I don't know if I told y'all about my mama my mama at the same time she was she was feeling a little sick but she was feeling that way way longer before me and we didn't know it honey she believed was mined said they'll sit and wrestle with something sometimes believe in God oh yeah and she writes the winning arousal winning huh and she was taking some medicine and it was dehydrating her so she my sister winning took her to the hospital and she called my sister come say I just dropped my mother you did right now the hospital is the worst place to be because it's an atmosphere of death now an atmosphere of healing is an atmosphere of death first thing they do earlier is they run tests and they pronounced sickness on you and then they isolate you isolate you into a place to where your loved ones can't see you none of your family members so why are you going through it a spirit of depression can come because of the isolation honey which will bring forth more sadness but by God's grace my mom had a weapon ho ain't goin where you think I'm going honey she had a weapon with her when she went to the hospital it was cold she had that cell phone and when she checked in to say son I just wanna let you know I got checked into the hospital I said what's going on yes I was just hydrating I came in to get checked out for that I said okay praise God next time I told you say hey you know sound good I wish to add some better food in here and then she came to testify her she said when she walked in they start to run all they test and do all they dissing and they say oh you might have it she say have what you might have the control device she says look I have ordered my calls and I know that I am justified she said look I came in here because I'm dehydrated y'all gonna treat me for dehydration and I'm leaving maybe the proper guard said earlier you don't have to accept the bag around snakes no matter what the atmosphere look like no matter what the whole the paradigm is her you get all of your calls she told the nurse I came in here for dehydration she said yeah but you got symptoms for this and simply for that my mama looked at his head dehydration and she was so convincing by Jason that they will spend let her go but they they read her chart and they found out she was in her 70s and it's up those are the people that's catching the virus so ma'am we can't let you go she said what you mean we can't let you go we need to run some more tests she said for hydration dehydration do all the tests I need so anyway they end up keep you know I call when she call me hallelujah and I found out it was keeping up saying next time don't you ever go to the hospital without praying with us first well I saved me cuz I believe what the Bible says he gave us power over unclean spirits oh sorry Church I'm trying to come down amen but you know she's in there a couple days they was testing the testing and couldn't find it you know when you go to the doctor and they can't find that that means it's a spirit they're trying to get you to accept honey but the only way you can have it is once you say okay I believe you I got you mr. doctor you so smart and you got what they're telling you to get huh how many people ever knew they had cancer without a doctor telling them first some people whipped it with that feeling fine and caliber then they said oh we see some Bruce Ehlers I feel good oh we think he got cancer and didn't start twisting remember it's a spirit before it becomes a disease the believers mindset honey but you know my mom I thank God for you know she she she was in there and in a couple days and - I think about two days now they said I think it took about a week to get the test back but her cat in her case it came back in two days that's kind of suspicious to me big doctor come back she say you look like a well-educated man a black man well educated the head doctor he comes in and say hey man why are you doing she said I'm doing good he says did they tell you she's like tell me what you got the fire she say look man and I know that I'm justified she chose the head doctor that was running all the tests running all the nurses and running that floor in the hospital honey she looked him straight in his face and she said look man I came in here for dehydration and that's all I'm getting treated for what else could he say but okay so they kept a little bit longer did you put on a slow boxes but it was too late that weapon she calling all of us huh talking to us amen we laughing on the phone brother Jason I don't think one time she called to say come on let's pray I'm feeling defeated not one time we just rejoice in the garden talking about the grace of God and making your stand o believers minds how do you respond when you meet adversity anyway to make a long story short she ended up leaving without the virus and just getting treated for dehydration just like she said and the doctor comes in says oh my you have a lucky case you say no I'm covered by the blood ain't nothing lucky by this what is our mindset what are we going through listen he says job job had a perfect revelation of God who he was and how God loved him how he waited hallelujah no matter what the circumstance was he waited listen to us he waited for his faith to be confirmed because he knew hurry up oh my he because he had a grip on God think about it the believer has a right to touch God we have a right to grab ahold of God in our circumstance we have a right Amen huh to get as close as we can and say God I believe you he said a revelation that spoke of last night he said now when the sick people that's in the healing in the building the crippled people and using have need of God when you can meet that type of revelation that you are justified when you are holy actually justified in asking the thing that you asked him for and believe that he is a rewarder of those that didn't seek Him there's nothing can ever separate you from that faith that's anchoring you that's the mindset of a believer huh will you go pray you believe that you're already justified before you even ask knowing I'm gonna get what I asked for we don't go to God wishing and hoping we go believing that God is and what we are to realize Harlan when you see the revelation of God you ought to see the revelation of who you are in God listen real quick you know because sometimes we ask God for things but with your fidgety oh we can't stay still long enough but listen I'm a break-in in the middle of those coldness in Jesus Christ the same high 55 he says now he's talking about a man who gets upset in church and they gathered 8 peeples and they moved from church to church listen what he says he says now but when a man will do he will hear a little something and keep moving his papers he says well now you will never find God moving your papers God ain't gonna tell you how he wants it to be syndicated he wants you to pray about seek his face hug and when you talk to you you know is him see we're overcome he says you never find God moving your papers you have to move yourself you have to move yourself oh yeah in the position where God holy can't see your thoughts and respond you are what your thoughts are he says you have to move your thinking and get away from reasoning earlier and move yourself from your own way of thinking to what God thinks so we need to ask the question where we go for God we're gonna say Lord show me your mind in this situation and move my thoughts to your thoughts but you know sometimes we ask and we believe that it's too much so before we acts we doubt because we believe is to be wasn't even acts if you doubt an already the believers mindset hurry we go to God with an assurance that he is job had a perfect revelation sometimes God would allow things just to rise up hidden things that are already laying in you that you didn't know was there you know God listen God told Joe everybody all right God told Abraham go walk before me and be thou perfect honey he told him to go walk and be perfect if God said that that meant Abraham could be perfect honey but look here he said go walk before me and be thou perfect honey but Abraham didn't know in his walking different things were gonna come out of him so God took him to that journey so he could be perfect honey on the journey he found out he was a liar that was already lying in there when God told him go be perfect on the journey hurry he was afraid gave his wife up God knew there was an element of fear hurry so God had to take him that way to get those things out of him so he could be perfect like God said and you wonder why you going the way you going is because God is protecting you we all say God four times like these because it's gonna show who you really are look Church he didn't know then he had some fear in him yes I'm lying all that was in him when God had already pronounced he was the father faith whoa boy that ain't no skim milk huh God can pronounce something over your life already knowing you're going to make mistakes already new and you're gonna fail but that doesn't change his thoughts about you see it's a believers mindset child should not change what we think and how we think about God listen once that came up he had a little argument of freaking with like holy things I came in the spirit all these things coming out of them he probably the Bible say he said this but I wasn't speaking hypothetically you know he probably he thought it was thing as a boy I brought you along with me I had to bring you all those there in my land you will up being harder with my people I seen you back on board he telling me say you go you choose whichever way you wanna go and God was dealing with him in a way that he could be perfect and he was Sarah at the same time knowing he pronounced it knowing Sarah was going down put her in a situation oh my church so believers mindset put in her situation honey that she knew she couldn't bring for her child she knew she couldn't fulfill that promise why gotta do things so you'll see it has to be him so none of us are giving you credit but think about it if she had a believers mindset right there the Bible like the perfect God said she would have waited on God but because she didn't at that moment didn't ever believe was mine said she gave my husband to another woman think about it she gave her hug her to another woman and the woman did exactly what she wanted to do brought for her child did she got man got mad bullfighting a woman kick out all these things and Abraham like she like kick out kick out gonna do it and he like me you don't want who did this people make decisions and didn't blame God for I'm sorry let me let me let me read this lemma close the church we have to we have to look at our journey look at our life don't be upset it's God perfecting you you go through things that seem unbelievable why me but it's God perfecting you he's building the perfect revelation of who he is to you oh my so that when things arise you fall back to that thinking again prime example Harlan Winkle I've showed his head what happened to David David went back to his parents thinking he was believed was mined said he went back to the bear he went back to the lion he said you know what you gonna be just like this if my god defeated this my God will defeat you huh he didn't worry about honey the paradigm-shifting he stood on his perfect revelation of God and then he added a limo to it because remember if you see who God has he's your God you should be able to see who you are in that God and by the time David honey y'all notice David didn't stop until you got in front of Goliath he kept going everybody asked him questions how can I listen how can I get what's the reward who I need to talk to you Bob Loblaw holding on finally he got in front of a lion cause his mind set his mindset was I'm gonna kill this giant before you even saw him in his mind Goliath was dead what about your colitis what's in your mind how long will it live how long will you go through it hurry you need to order your calls hallelujah because you're justified in what you're asking for listen I'm gonna keep going it's alright let me tell you people that streaming huh you might be looking at you might be in a quarantine you like be all these things you're wondering what churches like it still is okay God is still here you know get mad don't pause me I'm gonna come back that part later got me in the living room looking like this no I know I know I know when they come to people screaming me I know one of the things they love to do they love just one thing they loved it another turn me down they say I'm too loud I hear all this yelling tonight just give me the word I hang on here but God is in the place listen I'm not Morita time again I don't wait by God's grace this is the way I think Pentecost fail now I'm challenging your mindset where you are and no doubt we may have some family members who got sick and everything but that doesn't change who God is he may want to get that person in a position so they can repent and let you lead them to Christ he said the God will never you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you you say well I hate to bother you so you so much father he wants to be bothered we ought to be something up honey God wants to be bothered hallelujah y'all never win some place and use doing something and the salesperson was running from you supposed to be a salesperson ain't running from God wants to be bothered he say once we buy that where he does don't never think that you can exhaust earlier too much of God he said I believe the scripture says you have not because you ask not and you act not because you believe that he wants us to act and believe that how Joyce would be fool he wants you to act abundantly not catch this 100 he says acts for big things when was the last time you challenged your very own faith we were the last time you ordered your calls because you knew you were justified in what you were asking for like somebody chose their birthdays all that preachers on the pandemic and stuff you better be careful I am you can't tell I'm still serving them you better be careful I am I'm still under the blood he said ask for big things he says don't limit your faith how do you live in your faith with your mind he says no living your faith to some little mustard seed oh you know how we do his believers all I need is mothers evening he says get on out there hallelujah he said get out here to some other kind of faith and move out to big teams he says oh my little spy he says big things is just as easy to receive as little things hooray so you think about your mind next time huh he says you just have to believe that's all come on musicians you just have to believe that's all and you got faith just know exactly how to use it honey then it will be all right you can put it right to work and it'll just be fine put that put job 13 back up for me brother in the midst of us battling 13 and 18 in the midst of us battling and and serving the Lord I want y'all to remember the scripture behold now I have ordered my calls and I know that I shall be justified that God has justified the believer according to their faith so when you act you act in believing that God is Joe got a perfect revelation of God knowing who he was and like I said earlier once you get the revelation of God it's as always it's just it should also show you who you are that's why the prophet of God could make statements like when a brother was challenging him and say you just don't know your body says but I do know our real well Church let's have a believers mindset those brothers I didn't get a chance to get all the way into it but those brothers didn't stop - they got their brother in the presence of God no matter what it took hallelujah look they had to tear up the roof and you better believe it was a believers house cuz you ego going on believer house and care they roof Holly - might you want to put him in the presence of Jesus had to be believable say praise God praise God holy the supernatural was demonstrated in my house tonight praise God Jesus looked at him and say man you heal get up the believers mind said cousin I also want to read Joshua when Joshua was in the middle of the fight he's standing there fighting the enemy and the Sun is going down he's fighting in the Sun his movies fighting now look at his mind he knows if the enemy gets away he's gonna have a chance to regroup hurry so in his mind he was thinking honey what did God tell me God told me nothing will be able to stand before me not even the Sun Wow tell about the enemy we talk about the Sun the Sun had you obeyed Joshua because God told him nothing to be able to stand before you and look at this Commission Church we need to go back to our Commission he told Joshua be strong and very courageous why did he tell him that because God was getting them ready to fight how many times do you tell at least two or three times only bees out strong and very courageous if you listen close gotta tell you harder when the battle is coming and Joshua gets a hug and he ordered his girls hallelujah because he knew he was justified so he said son stand out still moon kneeling over the valley of agilar he ordered his cause and the whole thing Stood Still what happened the Sun and the moon huh creation heard from God again why because Joshua remembered what God told you and I guarantee you whatever standing in front of you when you can get your mind right and you speak with the mind of God that whatever sinful you will hear God when you speak let's pray Lord Jesus father we thank you Lord wouldn't mean to be so long Lord but I what can we say about your word it's everlasting Lord it turns and turns even with sitting still even we're afraid and even when we don't know what's next Lord in the midst of perilous times Lord but it's a glorious time for a believer because we're being made perfect lon no you're making us fit for the Masters use lord lord help us not to get sidetracked in the midst of this paradigm Lord as we approach let us approach with the same faith hurry the same genuine faith that Joshua had the same genuine faith that Joe had Lord a believers my incentive always thank you for this church the pastor knowing all the saints of God those that are here and not here cause you know it's not our desire to offend loves you we just want to be a vessel unto your honor no we'll give you praise and thanks in Jesus Christ's name even I give my mind completely to you Lowell fill me with your thoughts and make it all brand new and change my mind let me live in all that's true me I just wanna think like using it again now I give my mind [Music] completely to you oh yes fill me with your thoughts make it all brand new and it won't change my life and let me leave it all that's true I just wanted a man Wow that was I just just hearing just has he's referring to Abraham to job to David I don't know I feel like I could take any more of those and just preach a whole sermon right now my brother digs that was quite incredible you know I I appreciated so much of what he had to say just right almost from the beginning some of my favorite points can I give you just a few of my favorites you know shifting times reveals the real you reveals the real you and I you know I've always said for the cadre the worst kind of deception the self deception y'all heard me say that for years that's the worst kind of deception is self deception and I have said you know Jesus tells about how that children of the darkness run away from the light because it exposes their evil deeds and they don't like that but a real child of God runs to the light because he wants to be exposed I don't want to be embarrassed in front of the world but I want to know who the real me is and I got a problem Lord I want to know it don't leave me thinking I'm okay because what will happen is some shifting times something will happen and you won't have the faith that you need that you thought you had and God God sends these challenges into our lives to see we are and I that brother brother Diggs said that and I wrote my own little note under that you know we are really the ones who need to know I mean God already knows God seems these challenges not to know something he don't know but you're the one needs to know I need to know where I wear it my real faith is oh my god note after note after note after note wow that was so amazing you know about how that God ordered and blew my mind God ordered Abraham's life in order to for Abraham to match the vision God already had of him and said whoa before me and be perfect and here Abraham had all these ticking time bombs walking around with all these problems and weaknesses and God just simply led his life to uncover every one of them so I could blow up so Abraham could deal with it I just say Lord whatever it takes by whatever means necessary lead my life don't let me have these ticking time bombs I won't rid of them I don't want to blow up and they'll blow up just when you least expect it and when you really don't need it a bomb to go off that's when it'll happen so I just say Lord lead me by your word amen and David I never saw David I've never caught that that David you know come on let's be honest a lot of times we we talk a big talk why we're maneuvering to not have to face it David actually already had made a determination I'm gonna kill that guy and he he commenced to moving from person to person to person till he got to the king even had to go to the humiliation his brothers attacked him attacked his character accused him of a false motive David only had one motive on to kill this unbeliever yeah Navy didn't care what anybody thought this man has defied the armies of the Living God he's got a Keith gotta gotta die yeah and David went from person to person to person facing an impossible task and kept going through the King through everybody until he got where he wanted to be in front of Goliath Wow that rocked my world I don't think I've made a note to myself this angle may be the best story of faith I've ever heard so many of you know how that that David pressed pressed because he already knew what he was gonna do that was fantastic [Applause] Wow more and more I can keep going on I'd have to reap reach his sermon those quotes were fantastic brother I love that he had a grip on God his revelation was a grip on God amen we've got some prayer requests let me get to these before I just keep going on and on get where I need to be sister haylie we had prayed for a patient of hers and and so she's asking she says can I put another question for one of my patients his surgery went very well I thought but he's still in a lot of pain and asks for prayer and she says same patient as last time so we want to pray for that brother dawn gurgle writes in to say please pray for a 17 year old named Rosalynn she was taken to Hilton Head Hospital late this afternoon after throwing up blood and going unconscious her vitals are stable but she's still unconscious may the Lord touch her revive her and anoint the medical staff there to administer the correct procedures to make her well again I think that's the only one that I have for reading tonight amen praise the Lord we're gonna leave you right where you're standing and trying to observe our testimony and so we'll take these requests to the Lord you have a need you want to make make known to God by an uplifted hand Wow let's pray lord I feel so inspired by the word I heard tonight my goodness Lord my heart is on fire with faith to think of these things as your servant just went through the scripture and took us on a journey through the Bible took us on a journey and brings in the things our prophet had to say about it to just seal it Lord it's impossible to disbelieve right now Lord I'm believing for this need that sister Hayley writes in I'm believing father that this person will know immediate relief Lord because we're requesting it of thee that this young woman Lord will know immediate relief but we're bringing it before you we're asking Lord and we're believing father in our heart tonight I'm praying a prayer because I'm sending it and I believe you'll answer it Lord father I believe we're arriving at that time where we've got to we've got to call it out Lord according to your word and stand on it and believe it and confess it is done Granite Lord tonight meet both of these needs and hands that went up Lord across the audience and out through Lord the across the airwaves no doubt father needs tonight I'm believing for every one of them Lord Jesus there's other things in my heart and thou knowest things to be praying about and I'm believing for every one of them may you grant these things tonight Lord Lord let it be that these kinds of sermons Lord for such a time as this such an hour we're facing Lord when the enemy comes in like a flood we're to race we're to rate we're the standard we raised ourselves up to combat him in prayer and faith Lord so we're believing father I want it to be in coming days when the enemy comes in we'll remember the words the challenges the admonitions the instructions that we heard tonight I pray master that you'll grant these things to us we commit it to you in Jesus name Amen you know it but the digs when he is preaching along you know it the closest thing that I as far as like when you hear brother Diggs talking about his confession the closest thing that I read about that is if you read the testimony of brother Bosworth he was like that because people can say oh you better be careful confessing all that the devil is gonna make you prove it brother Bosworth had that kind of mentality that you heard tonight and he had it as into our life and died an old man in perfect health and it wasn't that the devil didn't attack him the devil attacked him constantly tried to make him sick many times the you know people could say I was sitting there thinking as you appreciate those days people could say who don't know the story and could say all that preaching better be careful you know never might strike him with cancer brain tumors so like hey devil already did and the devil already got defeated say well he might you might better be careful you might get struck with blindness that's already been tried man with stone blind and confessed his way out of it and sees clearly I'm here to take some friends listen you'll never go wrong confessing the word of Almighty God and standing on it and believing that I say this that it it has been good to be in the house of God blessed be the name of the Lord let's sing something set your way to the winds of faith you can fly in a higher place do not struggle it's my great oh yes [Music] [Music] do not struggle my [Music] [Music] take the word [Music]
