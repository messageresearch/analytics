[36:17] for a few moments.
[36:21] Amen. God bless you.

[36:50] Cleaned me up yesterday as well.
[36:53] Amen. Want to [clears throat] make a
[36:54] couple of just announcements before we
[36:57] uh proceed.
[36:59] [clears throat] Want to say how happy I
[37:01] am to be back in the saddle again. Wow.
[37:06] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[37:08] [applause]
[37:12] I think I can still remember how to do
[37:14] this.
[37:17] It's been uh since the week the Sunday
[37:20] prior to camp starting was the last time
[37:22] I stood here and then uh we didn't have
[37:24] Wednesday prior to camp and so as I said
[37:28] we had plenty of services they just
[37:29] weren't here but uh we had a wonderful
[37:32] time uh at camp and I think it was a
[37:36] wonderful success. Appreciate all the
[37:38] help. Amen. And um I've I've got kind of
[37:41] a a thing that I'd like to uh ask the
[37:44] young people to do.
[37:46] and that is to get me some testimonies.
[37:48] And maybe this Wednesday, the Lord
[37:51] willing, if the rapture comes, this will
[37:53] all change. But maybe this Wednesday,
[37:56] uh, if I can, uh, have the service
[37:58] again, then [clears throat] I'd like to
[38:01] maybe share some of those. And I've had
[38:03] some young people express to me that
[38:04] they want to write something down. Amen.
[38:07] And giving thanks to the Lord. And any
[38:08] of them that wish to uh, Amen. stand up
[38:11] and, you know, at the front and give
[38:13] their testimony, that would just be
[38:14] amazing. Amen. So, you be thinking about
[38:17] that, senior youth, and we'll get with
[38:19] you uh through the week. Amen. Thank you
[38:22] for all your prayers for [clears throat]
[38:24] me physically. Um you know, you shake
[38:27] 500 hands at a camp, you never know um
[38:31] what you um well, it's just the devil
[38:33] lurking, but he he ain't nobody still.
[38:36] He ain't nobody. He ain't never been
[38:38] nobody. The family of God, we're not
[38:40] subject to him. He don't get to decide
[38:42] anything about my life. If you need to
[38:44] believe that he makes no decisions
[38:47] regarding, now the Bible says with his
[38:49] own, he can do with him whatever he
[38:50] wants. Um, that's what the scripture
[38:52] says. Uh, whatever he wills, that's what
[38:55] he'll do. I can't imagine people would
[38:56] stay in his camp. Amen. Instead of
[38:59] fleeing to the camp of King Jesus. Amen.
[39:02] But, uh, when it comes to the family of
[39:05] God, he has no say. God uses him. Amen.
[39:09] U puts us through training. Amen. We're
[39:11] all in training. Amen. But uh Peter
[39:14] said, you know, that uh you know, these
[39:17] kind of things would come and you're not
[39:19] to even think it's strange. And you
[39:21] know, John said, you know, and the the
[39:23] you got to let patience have its work.
[39:25] And Paul talks about it. There's a lot
[39:27] that I want to say about that perhaps on
[39:29] Wednesday, the Lord giving me grace.
[39:33] But uh I feel probably 90% recovered.
[39:35] Got a little bit of a lingering cough.
[39:37] So if I have to cough my way through
[39:40] this sermon, that's okay. I'm going to
[39:42] preach it anyway. Amen. [laughter]
[39:44] Praise the Lord. So, um I thank you uh
[39:47] for also for your prayers and much help
[39:51] uh for Sister Debbie and I as we moved
[39:53] from our home of 25 years and we're um
[39:58] busy renovating the house next door as
[40:01] our new home. Amen. I'm going to stop
[40:04] calling it the church house. It's going
[40:05] to be Brother Jason, Sister Debbie's new
[40:07] home. So, we're looking forward to that.
[40:11] Um, apologize for the fellowship hall
[40:14] having to remain closed. I just ask your
[40:16] grace and pardon for that. Can't be
[40:18] avoided. I have um nowhere to really
[40:21] store a lot of the new appliances and
[40:24] lighting and different things like that.
[40:26] And so, um, it's just packed full of
[40:28] stuff and there's even more I've got to
[40:30] put in there. And, um, so, um, we're
[40:33] we're going just as fast as we can.
[40:36] Amen. And um I've I've let uh I've told
[40:39] sister Jen she can she's actually making
[40:42] partial use of it uh kind of a section
[40:44] of it. I'm starting to take it over with
[40:46] all my stuff. But um she's using a
[40:51] partially there uh for all of her many
[40:53] little beauties. Amen. Now Titus, I
[40:55] ain't calling you a beauty, brother.
[40:57] Where you at? Amen. Okay. And her her
[40:59] handsome young men. Praise the Lord.
[41:02] Gabe, good to have you guys here with us
[41:04] today as well. Brother Randy Strand,
[41:06] glad to have you all. Amen. I'm sure I'm
[41:08] forgetting somebody. Amen. Praise the
[41:11] Lord. Amen. Um, yeah, I'm forgetting
[41:13] somebody. Giddy's looking at me strange.
[41:15] Oh, yeah. Okay. Right here. Amen. Praise
[41:18] the Lord. Uh, whoever's a visitor, raise
[41:21] your hand.
[41:22] Praise the Lord. Uh, there's more than
[41:25] that. Come on, raise your hand. Amen.
[41:27] It's okay. I'm gonna just have everybody
[41:28] stare at you. [laughter]
[41:31] Just kidding. We're happy to have Amen.
[41:35] Uh, everybody in the house of God today.
[41:38] Praise the Lord. Um,
[41:41] so we are um, Brother Andrew and Brother
[41:45] Brad are renovating by all possible
[41:48] speed. It's really on me. I'm I'm the
[41:50] one who's kind of 3xed the original um,
[41:54] scope of work. Amen. And so um, they're
[41:57] going as fast as humanly possible.
[41:59] Brother Samuel has called up a small
[42:01] crew from Jacksonville to help out. And
[42:04] uh looks like um I'm going to get Big Al
[42:06] to come help. I got a report from Matt.
[42:09] Uh did he ever confirm, Matt, he's going
[42:10] to come help us and bring a helper? So,
[42:12] Amen. We're going to have to get that
[42:14] rascal back in church. Amen. Praise the
[42:17] Lord. Amen. I keep I was going to tell
[42:19] brother Matt the other day, when are you
[42:20] going to put on your preacher hat and
[42:22] say, Al, Alex, what are you doing? Why
[42:24] aren't you back in church? And I
[42:25] thought, why don't you do it yourself?
[42:26] So, I'm gonna I'm gonna do it myself,
[42:29] sister Melissa. Praise the Lord. Matt,
[42:30] you can you can do it as well. Amen. Um
[42:34] keep and so um so we're doing that and
[42:37] of course brother Matt is um doing that
[42:40] Matt Watkins thing that he does so well
[42:42] overseeing everything and getting it
[42:44] done and he has to deal with his mother.
[42:46] So y'all keep him in prayer please.
[42:49] Amen. Fasting and prayer for him. Amen.
[42:51] And we'll have the uh fellowship hall
[42:54] opened as rapidly as we can. There's
[42:57] some progress on the next stage of our
[42:59] fellowship hall renovation, but I'll
[43:02] leave that to brother Matt to report on
[43:03] things when they develop just a little
[43:05] bit more. There's some things happening
[43:07] behind the scenes. I want to make an
[43:09] announcement right before I go to to
[43:10] read my scripture that uh in five weeks
[43:15] um which actually would probably be
[43:17] about almost six weeks uh brother Aaron
[43:19] McGary and his lovely family will be
[43:22] with us for some winter meetings. We're
[43:24] going to have that'll be the second
[43:27] weekend of December. Second weekend of
[43:30] December. We're looking forward to that.
[43:33] Amen. I think that's all of my
[43:35] announcements. Everybody good?
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's stand back to our
[43:40] feet [clears throat]
[43:42] and um
[43:45] we're going to turn to Isaiah chapter 14
[43:48] again. We're carrying on this morning by
[43:50] the help of the Lord with our thought on
[43:54] Lucifer's competing claim. So that would
[43:58] make this part three, I believe. I
[44:02] believe two was the last one uh that we
[44:05] covered before camp.
[44:08] And um somehow
[44:12] Okay, that's fine. Just making sure I
[44:14] got all my ducks in a row here.
[44:19] Yeah.
[44:21] Amen.
[44:25] All right. And I want to read verses
[44:28] 1-7.
[44:31] Isaiah 14:1-7.
[44:34] I'm going to take my time and uh and not
[44:39] o try to overdo it and overt tax my
[44:41] system [clears throat]
[44:42] and uh so and that that'll be actually
[44:45] good for the kind of material I want to
[44:47] cover today at any rate from verse one
[44:50] Isaiah 14 and verse 1 through7 I believe
[44:54] I sent you brother Kevin for the Lord
[44:57] will have mercy on Jacob and will yet
[45:01] choose Israel and [snorts] set them in
[45:04] their own land. And the strangers shall
[45:07] be joined with them, and they shall
[45:10] cleave to the house of Jacob. And the
[45:13] people shall take them and bring them to
[45:15] their place. The house of Israel of
[45:19] Israel shall possess them in the land of
[45:22] the Lord for servants and handmmaids.
[45:25] And they shall take them captives whose
[45:27] captives they were, and they shall rule
[45:30] over their oppressors.
[45:33] And it shall come to pass in the day
[45:36] that the Lord shall give thee rest from
[45:38] thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from
[45:41] thy hard bondage, wherein thou was made
[45:44] to serve, that thou shalt take up this
[45:47] proverb against the king of Babylon, and
[45:50] say, How hath the oppressor ceased, the
[45:54] golden city ceased? The Lord hath broken
[45:58] the staff of the wicked and the scepter
[46:01] of the rulers.
[46:03] He who smoked the people in wrath with a
[46:06] continual stroke. He that ruled the
[46:09] nations in anger is persecuted and none
[46:13] hinderth. The whole earth is at rest and
[46:17] is quiet. They break forth into singing.
[46:21] Isn't that a beautiful scripture? Amen.
[46:24] Let's pray. [clears throat]
[46:26] Master, we thank you now for your word
[46:29] as we stand here, Lord. And I'm my heart
[46:32] is full of the thoughts that I want to
[46:34] express today. So I pray you'll be with
[46:37] me in body and in mind and give the
[46:39] people all hearing hearts today. Lord,
[46:41] we want to look at these very important
[46:44] things. Lord, it's a terrible hour upon
[46:47] the world and we must see your movements
[46:49] very clearly. We must see them. Lord, we
[46:52] must understand the rhythm. uh Lord of
[46:55] prophecy that is converging with time
[46:58] Lord and bringing events to pass that
[47:00] are unavoidable and unstoppable and
[47:02] irreversible and so Lord we want to know
[47:05] what is our part in the great drama I
[47:08] commit it to you now myself into your
[47:10] hands in Jesus name amen God bless you
[47:14] friends you can be seated
[47:18] [clears throat] brother Kevin let's hit
[47:20] Revelation 21
[47:23] and I want to give a little bit of a
[47:25] refresher and a little bit of a recap
[47:26] from where we've been taking our theme.
[47:30] We had formally been looking at Satan's
[47:35] claim had we read on down um from where
[47:40] we started this series in verse 12. If
[47:42] you remember, we're not don't need to
[47:44] reread it today, but Satan, the Bible
[47:47] says that, you know, he made a claim and
[47:50] he he was uh the son of the morning and
[47:53] and how he was cut down to the ground
[47:56] which did weaken the nations. And you
[47:59] remember the claim that he made in his
[48:01] heart that he would ascend above the
[48:04] stars of heaven. And that is of course
[48:07] the the family of God. He he made a
[48:10] claim that he would exalt his throne
[48:12] above the stars of God. And that's God's
[48:15] family. And he made a claim that he
[48:17] would actually be the one to sit on the
[48:20] throne in the north uh in the mount.
[48:23] Actually, I will sit upon the mount of
[48:26] the congregation in the sides of the
[48:28] Nord north. I will ascend above the
[48:32] heights of the clouds and I will be like
[48:35] the most high. knows he can't be God,
[48:38] but he he he impersonates God. And this
[48:41] is what brother Brandham, this is this
[48:43] is part of the purpose behind his
[48:46] sermon, the impersonation of
[48:48] Christianity. I don't want to be just an
[48:50] impersonator of Christianity of
[48:54] Christianity. I want to be the real
[48:57] deal. Amen.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; [cough]
[49:02] [clears throat]
[49:03] &gt;&gt; The Bible goes on to say how that he
[49:07] would come to an englorious end and that
[49:10] the people would look narrowly upon him
[49:13] as he descends into the pit. He's going
[49:15] to be according to the uh to the
[49:17] prophecy, he's going to be brought
[49:19] before the king. And there he's going to
[49:22] be cast down and put to death and cast
[49:26] into the lake of fire with the false
[49:28] prophet and uh and and all of these
[49:31] things are after the millennium and
[49:33] after the great white throne judgment.
[49:35] And God is going to make a thorough end
[49:38] of it. and and thus the Lord actually
[49:41] could say that uh the whole earth is at
[49:45] rest and is quiet. They bring forth they
[49:49] break forth into singing. That's going
[49:51] to be an understatement.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Breaking forth into singing. Friends,
[49:55] I'm going to tell you something,
[49:56] friends. The earth is headed for a peace
[50:00] that that will never be reversed.
[50:04] A peace and a contentment. Can you
[50:06] imagine? And it's hard to imagine,
[50:09] difficult to imagine that you can
[50:11] actually uh not only live out through
[50:14] one day but every day for the rest of
[50:16] your existence, which happens to be for
[50:18] a long time. That you will never feel
[50:21] anxiety again. You'll never have
[50:24] anything threaten you again. You won't
[50:26] have to worry about anything. There
[50:29] won't be any bills to pay. You won't OWE
[50:31] TAXES. YOU WON'T YOU WON'T NEVER GET
[50:34] SICK. YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF A
[50:37] HOME after 25 years. Amen.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; It's a It's a city whose builder and
[50:44] maker is God. And And whatever God
[50:48] makes,
[50:50] just think of it backwards, almost like
[50:52] reverse dominoes. Whatever God makes is
[50:55] something he spoke. And everything he
[50:57] spoke is something he thought. And the
[51:00] reason that it got to word and
[51:03] manifestation IS BECAUSE HIS THOUGHTS
[51:06] are immutable.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; And we're going to deal with that a
[51:09] little bit. HIS THOUGHTS CAN'T be
[51:10] altered. Immutable means it CAN'T BE
[51:12] ALTERED. THERE'S NO POWER THAT CAN ALTER
[51:16] God's thinking. Therefore, there's no
[51:18] power THAT CAN ALTER HIS WORD.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; People come up with other versions of
[51:23] his word. That doesn't change his word.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; He will JUDGE THE EARTH BY HIS WORD.
[51:29] SEE? AND SO WHOEVER TOOK ANOTHER GOSPEL
[51:32] or a different gospel or whoever lined
[51:34] up with their almost 40,000 different
[51:37] denominations and independent movements
[51:39] and wave their sign that they were his
[51:41] people. They put his NAME ON THEIR
[51:43] BUILDINGS. BUT HE NEVER PROMISED TO MEET
[51:45] THEM where they put his name. He said,
[51:47] "I'LL MEET YOU WHERE I PUT MY NAME." AND
[51:50] HE PUT HIS NAME IN JESUS. AND Jesus is
[51:52] his word. So the only PLACE THE ONLY
[51:56] PLACE FOR DIVINE FELLOWSHIP is faith in
[51:59] his word. THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THE BLOOD
[52:02] IS APPLIED IS FAITH IN HIS WORD. CUZ
[52:04] NONE OF YOU HAVE THE CHEMISTRY of his
[52:06] blood. NOBODY. NOBODY HAS A VIAL OF
[52:09] THAT. The Vatican doesn't. I'll promise
[52:11] you. That's not in Jerusalem anywhere.
[52:14] THERE'S NO SECRET CHAMBER THAT HAS THE
[52:17] BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. YOU HAVE NO
[52:19] ACCESS to it. That physical blood ran
[52:22] down the cross, claimed the earth. But
[52:25] brother Brandham SAID, "IT'S NOT THE
[52:26] CHEMISTRY of the blood. It's the life in
[52:29] the blood."
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; And the life IS IN THE WORD. SO WHEN YOU
[52:34] BELIEVE THE WORD, YOU GET THE LIFE WHICH
[52:36] IS THE BLOOD WHICH IS ETERNAL.
[52:38] HALLELUJAH.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; SEE, and so this this is why once you
[52:42] THIS I IF THAT IF THAT WASN'T TRUE, then
[52:46] Jesus could not make the irreversible
[52:49] claim that ONCE YOU HAVE PASS FROM DEATH
[52:52] TO LIFE, YOU CAN NEVER COME INTO THE
[52:55] JUDGMENT.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; HE COULDN'T MAKE THAT CLAIM IF HIS WORD
[52:58] WAS IMMUTABLE. IF YOU COULD BE BORN
[53:01] AGAIN AND BECOME A NEW CREATION AND THEN
[53:03] STUMBLE AND MAKE A MISTAKE AND LOSE
[53:05] THAT, THEN HIS WORD IS IMMUTABLE. I'M
[53:08] HERE TO TELL YOU, he's bringing me, HE'S
[53:11] BRINGING YOU. I KNOW WE DON'T ALWAYS
[53:12] FEEL LIKE IT, BUT HE'S BRINGING EVERY
[53:14] ONE OF US IMMUTABLY, UNCHANGEABLY,
[53:17] IRREVERSIBLY TO THE PERFECTION OF THIS
[53:20] WORD. The devil DON'T LIKE IT. SOMETIMES
[53:23] WE DON'T MAKE THE GRADE. IT DOESN'T
[53:25] MATTER. NOTHING STOPS THIS. AMEN.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY YOU BELIEVE IT. THIS IS WHY
[53:32] YOU CAN'T NOT BELIEVE IT.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; THIS IS EXACTLY WHY THE WORLD CAN'T
[53:38] receive it.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; See,
[53:40] SO SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT in in that
[53:43] regard, we begin to see a pattern.
[53:47] And so Lucifer had made his claim. Jesus
[53:52] makes his claim in Revelation 21. I SAW
[53:56] VERSE ONE, I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW
[53:58] EARTH. For the first heaven and the
[54:00] first earth were passed away. There was
[54:02] no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy
[54:04] city, New Jerusalem, coming down from
[54:06] God out of heaven, prepared as a bride
[54:08] adorned for her husband. And I HEARD A
[54:11] GREAT VOICE OUT OF HEAVEN SAYING,
[54:13] "BEHOLD, the tabernacle of God IS WITH
[54:16] MEN." NOW, THAT'S ALREADY UH WE'VE
[54:18] ALREADY GOT A A COMPETITION
[54:21] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE NOW GOD, THE BIBLE IS SAYING THE
[54:24] TABERNACLE OF GOD IS WITH MEN AND HE
[54:26] WILL DWELL THEM. DWELL WITH THEM. SEE,
[54:29] THE TABERNACLE OF GOD IS WITH MEN AND HE
[54:31] WILL DWELL WITH THEM AND THEY SHALL BE
[54:33] HIS HIS PEOPLE.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; SEE, BUT SATAN HAS CLAIMED, "NO, THEY'RE
[54:37] GOING TO BE MY PEOPLE." JESUS HAS
[54:40] CLAIMED A KINGDOM AND SATAN HAS SAID,
[54:41] "NO, I'M GOING TO HAVE THAT KINGDOM."
[54:44] &gt;&gt; JESUS HAS A PEOPLE. SATAN IS SAYING,
[54:46] "NO, I'M GOING TO HAVE YOUR PEOPLE.
[54:48] THEY'RE GOING TO BE MINE." I'M GOING TO
[54:49] TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. The the it
[54:53] was not a it was not a a secret. It was
[54:55] publicly stated that as we approached
[54:59] the new millennium uh at the end of 1999
[55:02] THAT THE VATICAN MADE A CLAIM that the
[55:05] Catholic Church was leading the world,
[55:07] they honestly believe they are leading
[55:09] the world into the millennium. Right.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; AND IF WE'VE HAD THE MILLENNIUM SINCE
[55:14] 2000, I WANT MY MONEY BACK.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; I would like a refund immediately,
[55:20] please. BECAUSE IT'S A SAD
[55:23] DISAPPOINTMENT FROM WHAT I READ THE
[55:24] MILLENNIUM supposed to be.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; And if AND IF AND IF THAT'S SATAN'S
[55:28] VERSION OF A MILLENNIUM NOW, WHAT DO YOU
[55:30] THINK IT'LL BE IF HE'S ABLE TO DEFEAT
[55:33] GOD? I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT'S
[55:35] IMPOSSIBLE.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; AND I'M I'm grateful that it's
[55:38] impossible. Amen.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Here is HERE IS VERSE FOUR. GOD SHALL
[55:44] WIPE AWAY ALL TEARS FROM THEIR EYES. AND
[55:47] THERE SHALL BE NO MORE DEATH, NOR
[55:49] SORROW, NOR CRYING, NOR ANY MORE PAIN.
[55:53] EVERY ONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE THE
[55:55] ESSENCE OF WHAT LUCIFER IS.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; SO, WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT A POLAR
[56:02] OPPOSITE CLAIM. YOU CAN'T GET MORE POLAR
[56:06] opposite
[56:07] &gt;&gt; than the claim of Lucifer versus the
[56:09] claim of Jesus.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; We found [clears throat]
[56:16] LAST HE SAID IN VERSE FIVE AND HE SAID,
[56:18] "HE THAT SAT UPON THE THRONE SAID,
[56:22] "BEHOLD, I MAKE ALL THINGS NEW." And he
[56:24] said unto me, "Write, for these words
[56:26] are true and faithful." THIS IS THE ONE
[56:28] SITTING ON THE THRONE. THIS IS HIS FINAL
[56:31] TESTAMENT. THIS IS VERY MUCH DIFFERENT
[56:34] THAN THE CLAIM LUCIFER MADE WHEN HE SITS
[56:36] on the throne.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; WE FOUND OUT IN IN PREVIOUS lessons that
[56:46] you know the where we found out the the
[56:48] the difference and and IT'S NOT REALLY
[56:51] SO MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE JUST A SLIGHT
[56:52] NUANCE in the use of the word bride
[56:54] versus wife. We found that you know the
[56:58] uh spirit and the bride say come in
[57:01] revelation 22 WE FOUND HIS WIFE HATH
[57:05] MADE HERSELF READY IN REVELATION 19 and
[57:08] THEN IN REVELATION 21 WE FIND THAT I
[57:11] WILL SHOW THEE THE BRIDE THE LAMB'S WIFE
[57:13] SO IT USES both terms in the same verse
[57:16] AND SO WE FOUND THAT ONE IS JUST SIMPLY
[57:18] DEALING WITH THE ESPOUSAL time when he
[57:22] would come at the end time to marry a
[57:25] bride be invisible visibly united WITH
[57:27] HER AND TAKE HER TO A WEDDING SUPPER. WE
[57:29] ESTABLISHED THAT CLEARLY THAT WE DON'T
[57:31] GO TO A WEDDING. We're married here.
[57:34] Brother Brandham made it clear. WE'RE
[57:35] MARRIED HERE AND WE GO TO THE WEDDING
[57:37] SUPPER. So now in this last day, he was
[57:41] able to come BECAUSE HE SENT A MESSAGE
[57:44] OF RESTORATION THAT WOULD CALL A BRIDE
[57:46] OUT AND HER PERFECTION BY BELIEVING THE
[57:49] WORD HE SENT RAISES THE DEAD FOR
[57:51] HUNDREDS OF YEARS.
[57:54] And we meet the Lord in the air. AND SO
[57:58] SO WE WE FIND that he had he HAD HAD TO
[58:02] SIT DOWN in the eternities there after
[58:05] the church fell away. THE WORD GOT
[58:07] SEALED UP UNDER SEVEN SEALS AND JESUS
[58:09] SAT DOWN in the eternities to intercede
[58:12] for the ignorance of of his people. not
[58:15] able uh in in order to save them, he
[58:19] would withhold all the word from them
[58:22] BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BECAUSE SIN IS
[58:24] UNBELIEF AND THAT'S WHAT'LL GET YOU
[58:26] KILLED.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AND THAT'LL GET YOU
[58:28] DOOMED IS TO DISBELIEVE THE WORD.
[58:32] [snorts]
[58:32] &gt;&gt; SO HE WITHHELD THE WORD BECAUSE YOU
[58:34] CAN'T DISBELIEVE WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; You see? SO HE'S INTERCEDING FOR THEIR
[58:39] IGNORANCE. BUT JUST NOW HE THAT'S NOT
[58:42] NOVEL OR NEW. HE HAD done that for
[58:44] Israel. Paul made Paul, THAT WAS PAUL'S
[58:47] MESSAGE THERE IN THE BOOK OF ACTS TO HIS
[58:50] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. THERE WAS A TIME HE
[58:52] SAID THAT YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU BROUGHT
[58:54] YOUR BLOOD OF BULLS and goats and YOU
[58:57] GAVE THESE SACRIFICES AND GOD WKED AT
[59:00] YOUR IGNORANCE.
[59:02] But now he's not willing to do that
[59:03] anymore BECAUSE OF THAT DAY ON CALVARY.
[59:07] BECAUSE HE AROSE AND ASCENDED AND SENT
[59:10] BACK HIS LIFE. AND PETER HAS ALREADY
[59:12] ESTABLISHED WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE NEW
[59:14] BIRTH. YOU HAVE TO REPENT AND BELIEVE.
[59:17] SEE? AND NOW, SO PAUL SAID, "SO YOU'RE
[59:20] 1600 YEARS." THEY DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE
[59:22] TODAY THAT AFTER 2,000 YEARS WE NEEDED A
[59:25] PROPHET. BUT AFTER 1600 YEARS, PAUL
[59:29] SAID, "ALL OF YOUR LAW OF MOSES IS NOW
[59:32] WORTHLESS. IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU GOD
[59:34] WILL NOT HONOR THAT SYSTEM ANY LONGER.
[59:37] IT WAS A TEMPORARY SITUATION. AND HE HAS
[59:41] STEPPED OUT OF THE ETERNITIES. HE HAS
[59:43] CLAIMED THE BOOK. HE HAS LOOSED THE
[59:45] SEALS. AND HE REQUIRES ALL MEN WHO WANT
[59:48] TO BE REDEEMED TO COME TO THE OPENING OF
[59:50] THE WORD.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; These things are not new to US. THIS IS
[59:55] ELEMENTARY TEACHING.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; SO, SO [clears throat] WE FIND THEN that
[1:00:00] that when it when he comes TO THIS POINT
[1:00:03] IN REVELATION 22
[1:00:06] AND THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE SAY,
[1:00:08] "COME." NOW I I'M REALLY STARTING TO
[1:00:11] TURN INTO FRESH MATERIAL. So really keep
[1:00:13] your keen attention. AND YOU YOU ALREADY
[1:00:16] ARE. THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT
[1:00:18] POINT. [clears throat]
[1:00:19] The spirit and the bride say come.
[1:00:24] Now, I I
[1:00:27] WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BRING YOU TO THE
[1:00:29] FACT THAT IN FACT, AS WE COVERED IT in a
[1:00:31] previous installment,
[1:00:33] THAT GOD HIMSELF, AS WE read in
[1:00:38] REVELATION 19, SHALL DWELL with them.
[1:00:41] THERE'S NOWHERE, THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
[1:00:43] IN THE WHOLE BIBLE IT EVER SAYS THAT God
[1:00:45] himself shall dwell with them. And
[1:00:47] brother BRHAM MAKES THAT VERY CLEAR
[1:00:50] BECAUSE NOTICE THAT WHEN HE COMES IN THE
[1:00:52] rapture that his feet don't touch the
[1:00:56] earth. We meet Jesus in the air.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Now, it's true that Jesus is in the
[1:01:01] MILLENNIUM BECAUSE HE'S IN A GLORIFIED
[1:01:03] BODY. WE'RE IN GLORIFIED BODIES. UH THE
[1:01:07] 144,000 ARE IN GLORIFIED BODIES. I I I'm
[1:01:10] PRETTY SURE THOSE UNDER THE FIFTH SEAL
[1:01:12] ARE IN GLORIFIED BODIES. I'M NOT SURE
[1:01:14] ABOUT THE REST OF THE NATIONS THAT ARE
[1:01:16] RAISED UP DURING A thousand years.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; I don't know. It's brother Brennham
[1:01:20] didn't did didn't to make it clear.
[1:01:22] PERHAPS HE LOOKED AT IT. THEY ASKED HIM
[1:01:24] QUESTIONS. Will we have children? Will
[1:01:26] we not? HE SAYS, "WELL, IN PLACES IT
[1:01:28] LOOKS LIKE WE WILL. IN PLACES IT LOOKS
[1:01:31] like we won't." He said, "I don't know.
[1:01:33] If he ever tells me, I'll tell you."
[1:01:35] Because the millennium IS A HONEYMOON.
[1:01:37] THERE'S CERTAIN PARTS THAT ARE KEPT
[1:01:39] SECRET. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL IT'LL BE,
[1:01:41] BUT I KNOW I WANT TO BE THERE.
[1:01:46] [clears throat]
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; That's the one I want RULING THE EARTH,
[1:01:48] NOT THIS OTHER GUY WHO made his big
[1:01:50] claims in Isaiah 14. Amen.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; So, SO WE WE FIND THEN THAT THAT THIS
[1:01:58] THAT THAT I WANT YOU TO consider this
[1:02:00] FOR A FOR A MOMENT NOW BECAUSE as we've
[1:02:03] been showing you to me when I look at it
[1:02:07] THAT GOD HIMSELF BECAUSE REMEMBER even
[1:02:11] in the millennium THE EARTH IT DOESN'T
[1:02:14] SAY GOD HIMSELF. JESUS IS THERE WITH US
[1:02:17] AND THEY'RE THE SAME PERSON. YOU
[1:02:19] UNDERSTAND? BUT JUST WATCH JUST LIKE THE
[1:02:22] BRIDE AND THE WIFE ARE THE SAME PERSON
[1:02:24] BUT IT'S JUST DIFFERENT ALLOCATIONS
[1:02:26] WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THAT AT THAT MOMENT
[1:02:28] BECAUSE WHILE WHILE WE are in GLORIFIED
[1:02:32] BODIES THE WORD IS ALREADY IN ITS EIGHTH
[1:02:34] DAY.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; The opening OF THE SEALS BROUGHT THE
[1:02:38] WORD BACK TO ITS ETERNAL DAY. MY SOUL IS
[1:02:42] ALREADY IN ITS ETERNAL DAY.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; SEE MY BODY IS NOT YET BUT IT WILL BE.
[1:02:48] BUT EVEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS IN THE
[1:02:50] MILLENNIUM, THE EARTH WILL STILL BE IN
[1:02:52] ITS SEVENTH DAY.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; NOW, THE CURSE IS TAKEN OFF THE EARTH
[1:02:56] AND IT'S WRITED 23° UP ON ITS CORRECT
[1:02:59] AXIS. SO, WE GET THE THE POLAR CAPS
[1:03:01] BACK.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; THEY ALREADY KNOW THERE'S VEGETATION
[1:03:04] UNDER THAT ICE. IT DIDN'T USED to be
[1:03:06] ice. [clears throat]
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; That's an understatement. So, so we know
[1:03:11] THAT THAT BUT BUT YET THE EARTH HAS TO
[1:03:13] LIVE OUT ITS SEVENTH DAY. AND THAT'S WHY
[1:03:16] IN AFTER THE MILLENNIUM AND AFTER THE
[1:03:18] JUDGMENT AND AFTER SATAN HAS BEEN
[1:03:21] ANNIHILATED AND DEATH AND HELL ARE CAST
[1:03:24] INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE AND ALL EVIL IS
[1:03:27] DONE AWAY WITH AND THE EARTH IS FINALLY
[1:03:29] FOREVER AT PEACE AND IN QUIET, THEN GOD
[1:03:32] HIMSELF SHALL DWELL. AND EVERY TIME WHEN
[1:03:35] WE THINK ABOUT GOD'S PRESENCE, WE
[1:03:38] REALIZE THAT THAT THAT GREAT ETERNAL
[1:03:40] SPIRIT MANIFEST HIMSELF IN HIS WORD.
[1:03:44] THAT GREAT ETERNAL SPIRIT MANIFEST
[1:03:46] HIMSELF IN PROPHETS
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; AND THEY CALLED THEM GODS.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAYS MOSES WAS A GOD TO
[1:03:53] THE PEOPLE.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AND SO THEN HE MANIFEST
[1:03:56] HIMSELF FULLY IN CHRIST. NOW HE'S
[1:03:59] MANIFESTING HIMSELF FULLY IN THE BRIDE.
[1:04:01] IT'S THE SAME GOD ALL THE TIME. ONLY NOW
[1:04:04] HE'S NOT TRAPPED WALKING THE SHORES OF
[1:04:06] GALILEE BECAUSE HE GAVE HIM THE
[1:04:08] COMMISSION GO INTO ALL THE WORLD. HOW
[1:04:10] WAS THAT EVER GOING TO HAPPEN? EVEN IF
[1:04:12] THEY WENT INTO ALL THE WORLD, WHAT GOOD
[1:04:13] WOULD IT DO THEM UNLESS HE GOD CAME AND
[1:04:16] LIVED INSIDE THEM?
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN I LOOK AT GOD HIMSELF DWELLING,
[1:04:23] I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A SECOND BEING OTHER
[1:04:26] THAN JESUS. I'M LOOKING AT HIS WHOLE
[1:04:28] FAMILY AND ALL THE EARTH AND ALL
[1:04:30] CREATION AND THE WHOLE ROLE OF THE
[1:04:33] LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE IS NOW FILLED. AND
[1:04:36] GOD [screaming]
[1:04:37] HIMSELF WHO FILLS ALL TIME, SPACE, AND
[1:04:40] ETERNITY. AMEN.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; WILL BE LIVING AND ABIDING WITH IN AND
[1:04:45] through
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to sit down with Jesus for
[1:04:50] thousands of years.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; And just talk. Hallelujah.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:04:59] so I WANT TO WHEN WE SO WHEN WE COME TO
[1:05:02] AND THAT'S THE THAT'S REALLY
[1:05:06] why
[1:05:08] Satan's vision wouldn't do him any good
[1:05:14] even IF HE COULD PULL IT OFF BECAUSE HE
[1:05:18] CANNOT INDWELL GOD'S FAMILY.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? HE CAN POSSESS THE FALSE
[1:05:24] PROPHET, BUT HE CAN'T DIVIDE HIMSELF
[1:05:27] INTO HIS CHURCH LIKE THAT. HE'S GOT
[1:05:29] DEMONS. BUT I'M GLAD GOD DIDN'T JUST
[1:05:32] SEND ANGELS TO GIVE ME A NEW BIRTH. GOD
[1:05:35] HIMSELF CAME INSIDE ME. AND AND THE LIFE
[1:05:39] I LIVE, I NOW LIVE BY THE FAITH OF, NOT
[1:05:42] IN, BUT OF THE SON OF GOD.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; So [clears throat] you're you're good.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; I don't want to lose you. THIS IS JUST
[1:05:52] IT'S PROFOUND AND IT'S REALLY OCCUPIED
[1:05:56] MY MIND FOR WEEKS.
[1:06:00] So when we and I have much more to say
[1:06:03] that I'm not going to get into today,
[1:06:06] THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE SAY COME.
[1:06:09] [clears throat]
[1:06:10] SO NOW HAVING SAID WHAT I'VE SAID, it's
[1:06:13] all about God
[1:06:16] manifesting,
[1:06:18] calling all those names and living in
[1:06:19] them and resurrecting them and getting
[1:06:21] through the millennium and being there
[1:06:22] in the new heavens and the new earth.
[1:06:23] And from there, remember I I ended I
[1:06:26] THINK PART ONE WITH BUT WAIT THERE'S
[1:06:28] MORE BECAUSE THEN THERE'S THE HIDDEN
[1:06:30] MANA AND WE DON'T EVEN THAT'S A THAT
[1:06:33] THAT'LL BLOW FUSES CUZ WE DON'T WE GOT
[1:06:35] ALMOST NO INFO ALMOST NO INTEL ON THAT.
[1:06:39] WE GOT MORE ON THE MILLENNIUM THAN WE
[1:06:40] GOT ON THAT. ALL WE KNOW IS BROTHER
[1:06:42] BRANDHAM JUST SAID IT IS ALL HE SAID. HE
[1:06:44] SAID SOMETIMES the hidden mana the
[1:06:47] future application of the hidden mana he
[1:06:49] said sometimes where you know we hear
[1:06:51] the word of God and we THINK IT IS SO
[1:06:53] GOOD AND YOU THINK IT IS SO GOOD AND
[1:06:55] YOU'RE REJOICING WITH ME TODAY HE SAID
[1:06:58] someday he and that word will become
[1:07:00] what you never dreamed possible
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; what does that even mean I don't know
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; but I want to be there
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; see
[1:07:10] because whatever it is it's the word
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; becoming more. I'M GOING TO BECOME WHAT
[1:07:16] I never dreamed possible. YOU'RE GOING
[1:07:18] TO BECOME WHAT YOU NEVER DREAMED
[1:07:20] POSSIBLE. WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? I
[1:07:23] DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD
[1:07:24] TO IT.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, I BELIEVE IT WILL BE THE
[1:07:29] ETERNAL UNFOLDING OF THE MYSTERY OF THE
[1:07:32] REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST IN THE
[1:07:34] CEASELESS AGES TO COME. I just want to
[1:07:37] roll around on the ground right now. I
[1:07:39] FEEL LIKE I COULD JUST LAY DOWN AND JUST
[1:07:41] ROLL AROUND. If I had snow, I'd make
[1:07:43] SNOW ANGELS. I I I FEEL LIKE RUNNING. I
[1:07:46] FEEL LIKE ROLLING. I GET TO THINKING OF
[1:07:48] IT LIKE THAT, I I DON'T WANT TO GET OUT
[1:07:50] AND RUN UP THE ROAD. I'D PROBABLY OUTRUN
[1:07:52] TRAFFIC.
[1:07:55] I ain't going to try it, but
[1:08:00] So, SO NOW WHILE NOW THAT I'VE GOT YOUR
[1:08:03] MIND IN THAT VEIN, I want you to think
[1:08:05] about this verse with me. And the spirit
[1:08:08] and the bride. KEV, LET'S GO AHEAD AND
[1:08:10] PUT THAT UP. 22:17 Revelation 22:17
[1:08:14] [sighs]
[1:08:15] and the spirit and the bride say come.
[1:08:19] So now we're understanding
[1:08:22] THAT THE MOST SUPERIOR FORM OF the word
[1:08:26] is when it's in flesh.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; When it's speaking through a lived life.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; You understand that this is exactly why
[1:08:35] Peter You say more so than than the
[1:08:38] Bible. Okay, calm down. Hold on. This is
[1:08:41] just ink on paper
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; that a publisher put together. Now, the
[1:08:45] the magic part of it is is that the
[1:08:48] words are the thoughts of God. So,
[1:08:50] they're divine.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; And you'll get a blessing reading it.
[1:08:53] Even though a publisher published it,
[1:08:55] YOU'LL GET A BLESSING AND JUST HEARING
[1:08:57] somebody read it. AND BROTHER BRANDON
[1:08:59] PUT HIS DOWN ON A CHAIR AND WALKED
[1:09:01] AROUND AND SAID, "LORD, THERE'S LIFE IN
[1:09:03] THERE FOR WHOEVER." SO, SO WE'RE NOT
[1:09:05] WE'RE NOT SUBTRACTING ANYTHING FROM YOUR
[1:09:07] BIBLES. BUT, BUT REMEMBER THAT WHEN
[1:09:10] PETER COMPARED THE OLD TESTAMENT BIBLE
[1:09:13] TO JESUS, HE SAID TO THE CHURCH, "WE
[1:09:17] HAVE A MORE SURE WORD OF PROPHECY THAN
[1:09:19] THAT BIBLE BECAUSE IT ONLY TOLD ABOUT
[1:09:22] THE MESSIAH COMING. I SAW HIM. I ATE
[1:09:25] WITH HIM. I FISHED WITH HIM. I HAVE A
[1:09:28] MORE SURE WORD. I HAVE A SUPERIOR
[1:09:31] VERSION OF THE WORD THAN THE WHAT THE
[1:09:33] word was when it was written in scrolls.
[1:09:36] So that should be easy. Nobody should
[1:09:39] impugn me for that. See, SO SO
[1:09:43] JESUS NEVER CARRIED A BIBLE.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz he was the word made flesh.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; I don't want you TO DARE THINK I'M
[1:09:51] MINIMIZING YOUR BIBLE. This is the This
[1:09:54] is your This is your UM YOUR YOUR BIBLE
[1:09:57] BASIC INFO BEFORE LEAVING EARTH.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Uh Brother Earl used to tell me
[1:10:06] that way back up in back in the day.
[1:10:07] I've heard that. I almost couldn't
[1:10:09] remember how it went. SO, SO WE REALIZED
[1:10:12] THEN THAT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD MADE A
[1:10:15] STATEMENT WHEN THE BOOKS ARE CLOSED FOR
[1:10:17] THE LAST time the word will be flesh.
[1:10:20] Now, IF THAT'S NOT SUPERIOR, WHY WOULD
[1:10:22] YOU close them FOR THE LAST TIME? WHY
[1:10:24] WOULD YOU NOT JUST KEEP IT OPEN FOREVER
[1:10:26] AND just let everybody go around reading
[1:10:28] it for ceaseless ages? HE'S BECOMING
[1:10:31] SOMETHING. YOU'RE NOT MEMORIZING VERSES.
[1:10:35] YOU'RE BECOMING VERSES.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL'S NOT AFRAID OF HOW MANY
[1:10:41] VERSES YOU CAN QUOTE. HE'S AFRAID OF HOW
[1:10:44] MANY VERSES live
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; inside you. Amen.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; SO THE MOST SUPERIOR FORM OF THE WORD IS
[1:10:55] WHEN IT'S MANIFESTED IN FLESH LIKE
[1:10:58] JESUS. See this is what the Holy Ghost
[1:11:01] is given for. This is why IT CAME. THIS
[1:11:04] IS WHY WE HAVE A MESSAGE AND A MESSENGER
[1:11:07] TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. IT WASN'T
[1:11:09] POSSIBLE. THE CHURCH COULDN'T GO IN THE
[1:11:11] RAPTURE IN THE CONDITION IT WAS IN. AND
[1:11:13] AS IF THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH, IT
[1:11:15] COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER.
[1:11:17] IT TOOK IT TOOK GOD SENDING A PROPHET.
[1:11:20] AND PEOPLE SAY, "WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
[1:11:23] WHY did he always do that?"
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; THE ANSWER IS NOT DIFFERENT. WHY DID HE
[1:11:27] ALWAYS DO THAT? SEE, BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
[1:11:30] GOD speaks to human peop to humans
[1:11:32] through prophets.
[1:11:34] AND SO, SO THEN NOW WATCH AS IT GOES ON.
[1:11:39] The spirit AND THE BRIDE SAY, "COME."
[1:11:42] And let HIM THAT HEARETH SAY COME. and
[1:11:45] let HIM THAT IS A THIRST COME AND
[1:11:48] WHOSOEVER WILL LET HIM TAKE OF THE WATER
[1:11:50] OF LIFE FREELY. So the spirit IN AND
[1:11:55] THROUGH THE BRIDE are saying something
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT words
[1:12:03] proceeding merely from their lips. What
[1:12:08] the world is hearing IS THE VOICE OF A
[1:12:12] LIVED LIFE. And the LIVE LIFE LOOKS LIKE
[1:12:15] SOMETHING THAT WOULD INVITE PEOPLE TO
[1:12:18] LOVE GOD.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT A CHRISTIAN IS. SEE,
[1:12:23] WHATEVER THIS LIFE IS, IT IS
[1:12:26] SUCCESSFULLY
[1:12:28] INVITING THE WORLD WHO ARE THIRSTY, WHO
[1:12:32] WANT LIFE, WHOEVER WANT TO TAKE THE
[1:12:35] WATER OF LIFE FREELY. YOUR LIFE MAKES
[1:12:38] [screaming] THEM BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE.
[1:12:42] [cheering]
[1:12:43] AMEN.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; APOLOGETICS WON'T DO THAT. APOLOGETICS
[1:12:48] APOLOGISTS ARGUE WITH ANOTHER APOLOGIST.
[1:12:50] AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, I MEAN, IF IF
[1:12:52] THAT'S IT, THEN I CAN GET TWO LEARNED
[1:12:54] APOLOGIST AND I'LL AND THEY'LL DISAGREE.
[1:12:57] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THEY WERE
[1:12:58] DISAGREEING ON A PUNCTUATION 2,000 YEARS
[1:13:01] AGO. IF APOLOGIST
[1:13:04] CAN DO IT, THEN WHY DO WE GO FROM ONE
[1:13:07] TRUE GOSPEL TO 40,000?
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES, SIR.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE INSANE TO KEEP BELIEVING
[1:13:14] THAT APOLOGETICS CAN FIX IT.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; I'M GLAD FOR APOLOGETICS. I'M GLAD FOR
[1:13:19] ETMOLOGY. I'M GLAD FOR ALL OF THESE
[1:13:21] DISCIPLINES. THEY HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND
[1:13:23] THE WORD. AND SO I I WAS JUST LOOKING AT
[1:13:25] THE ETMOLOGY OF THE WORD ESSENCE, GOD'S
[1:13:28] ESSENCE. AND AND ARISTOTLE SAID THAT
[1:13:31] THAT ESSENCE IS ESSENCE MEANS WHAT IT
[1:13:34] IS.
[1:13:36] I thought, okay, that sounds a little
[1:13:38] modern, but that's WHAT HE SAID ESSENCE
[1:13:41] WAS. IT'S THE HE SAID, IT'S THE THIS.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS HIS WORDS. IT'S WHAT IT IS.
[1:13:47] WHAT'S ESSENCE? IT'S WHAT IT IS. IT'S
[1:13:49] the this. [laughter]
[1:13:51] Oh my goodness.
[1:13:54] SO,
[1:13:56] SO IT'S OUR LIVED LIFE. NOW, HERE COMES
[1:14:00] MY TURN. You holding on?
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:04] So, we're living a life
[1:14:07] that has a voice,
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; that is a testimony to the world, that
[1:14:12] gives them hope that there can be
[1:14:14] something better than what they have.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; But how would that scripture be relevant
[1:14:22] to us after we're seated at the marriage
[1:14:25] supper?
[1:14:28] You're not going to be here living your
[1:14:30] life inviting sinners, giving them hope.
[1:14:34] So, it has no relevance to you. IT HAS
[1:14:38] NO EFFECTIVE PURPOSE.
[1:14:41] Once we're raptured,
[1:14:44] once we're gone, you're you're not going
[1:14:46] to be in the earth living a life
[1:14:48] inviting him to come to take the water
[1:14:51] of life freely.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; SO, IF THAT'S THE CA, DO YOU AGREE WITH
[1:14:55] THAT?
[1:14:57] Then that being the case, then this HAS
[1:15:01] TO BE OUR MARK, OUR PRIZE, OUR HIGH
[1:15:04] CALLING. THIS HAS TO BE WHAT'S ACTIVE IN
[1:15:08] YOUR LIFE NOW,
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; NOT IN THE FUTURE. IT WON'T DO THE WORLD
[1:15:13] ANY GOOD IN THE FUTURE. ONCE YOU'RE AT A
[1:15:16] WEDDING TABLE, IT'S ALL OVER. THIS IS
[1:15:19] YOUR TIME TO HAVE THIS VOICE. THIS IS
[1:15:23] YOUR TIME TO MAKE A THIRSTY SINNER
[1:15:25] BELIEVE THERE'S A FOUNTAIN SOMEWHERE.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; THIS IS YOUR TIME TO LET THE LOWER
[1:15:32] LIGHTS BE BURNING
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; TO SEND A GLEAM AL ACROSS THE WAY THAT
[1:15:37] SOME POOR WAYFAIRING SEMEN YOU MAY
[1:15:41] rescue you may save.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:15:56] And this is a new line of thinking for
[1:15:58] me. I've been pondering it. [snorts]
[1:16:01] Nothing
[1:16:03] in judgment
[1:16:06] that pours out ON THE EARTH, NOR IN
[1:16:08] RESTORATION. God has been judging and
[1:16:11] pouring out judgment and restoration.
[1:16:13] judgment, restoration, judgment,
[1:16:15] restoration
[1:16:16] down through the centuries. AND I WANT
[1:16:19] TO SAY THAT NOTHING IN judgment
[1:16:22] nor in restoration
[1:16:26] happens suddenly. This is very
[1:16:28] important.
[1:16:30] It's very important.
[1:16:32] I heard a a Jewish scholar talking about
[1:16:34] how that that first century AD
[1:16:38] leading up to AD70 when Israel was when
[1:16:43] Jerusalem was sacked by Titus and the
[1:16:47] Roman legions.
[1:16:49] AND HE SAYS THAT DIDN'T JUST SUDDENLY
[1:16:52] HAPPEN. He said WHEN YOU GO BACK AND
[1:16:55] LOOK AT OUR HISTORY, we were WE WERE
[1:16:57] SINNING HORRIBLY SINNING ALL THE WAY UP
[1:17:00] to it. AND HE SAID SIGNS AND THINGS WERE
[1:17:03] HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AND POLITICS and
[1:17:06] things were THINGS WERE MOVING THAT WERE
[1:17:08] SETTING THE STAGE FOR THAT JUDGMENT.
[1:17:13] THE WORLD RIGHT NOW IS BEING SET UP FOR
[1:17:16] JUDGMENT. THE TRIBULATION DOESN'T IT
[1:17:19] IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO START PRETTY
[1:17:21] QUICKLY ONCE THE BRIDE IS GONE. BUT YOU
[1:17:24] UNDERSTAND FRIENDS THAT THE THAT THE
[1:17:26] TRIBULATION THAT BREAKS UNDER THE SIXTH
[1:17:29] SEAL HAS ALREADY PARTIALLY CRACKED OPEN.
[1:17:33] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID ALL THOSE SEALS
[1:17:34] PARTIALLY OPEN. WE WE WE SHOWED YOU THAT
[1:17:37] WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE VIALS WHICH
[1:17:39] CORRELATE TO THE TRUMPETS AND AND AND
[1:17:41] AND THAT SIXTH SEAL OF PEOPLE SAY WELL
[1:17:44] HOW IS THE SIXTH SEAL AHEAD OF THE
[1:17:45] SEVENTH SEAL IF THE SEVENTH SEAL IS THE
[1:17:47] COMING OF THE LORD AND THEN THE TRI SIX
[1:17:48] SEAL IS THE TRIBULATION BECAUSE THE
[1:17:51] SEVENTH SEAL IS HIDDEN IN THE SIXTH
[1:17:52] SEAL. THE SIXTH SEAL OPEN WHEN THOSE
[1:17:55] DEMON CHARGERS WERE ACTUALLY EVEN BEFORE
[1:17:58] THAT SATAN IS IS CAST DOWN AND HE'S
[1:18:01] GIVEN THE KEYS TO THE BOTTOMLESS PIT AND
[1:18:04] HE UN UNLOCKS IT AND THE BIBLE TALKS
[1:18:07] ABOUT THE THE DEMONS THAT CAME UP OUT OF
[1:18:10] THERE AND BROTHER BRANDHAM'S WORDING IS
[1:18:12] DEMON POWERS ARE STREAMING into the
[1:18:14] earth THE LID'S BEEN TORN FROM HELL
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; AND DEMON POWERS ARE STREAMING SO SO
[1:18:22] THEN THEN THE SO THEN YOU'VE GOT THE THE
[1:18:24] TRIBULATION IS UNDERWAY AND THAT STARTS
[1:18:28] WITH A first woe and AND IT WOULD JUST
[1:18:31] GO SECOND WOE, THIRD WOE, TRIBULATION,
[1:18:34] ARMAGEDDON DONE. BUT AN ANGEL RISES UP
[1:18:38] OUT OF THE EAST HAVING THE SEAL OF THE
[1:18:41] LIVING GOD. IT COULD BE NOBODY BUT
[1:18:43] CHRIST BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY THE HOLY
[1:18:45] GHOST CAN GIVE YOU THE SEAL. AND HE
[1:18:47] RISES FROM THE EAST AND HE HAS STRANGELY
[1:18:51] HE HAS AUTHORITY TO TO ENFORCE A
[1:18:54] TEMPORARY INJUNCTION ON GOD'S WORD. WHO
[1:18:57] CAN DO THAT BUT GOD HIMSELF YOU CAN'T
[1:18:59] INJUNCT GOD'S WORD. THERE'S NO COURT
[1:19:01] AHEAD OF HIS THAT CAN GO JUST A SECOND
[1:19:03] GOD. UH ONLY GOD CAN DO THAT. SO THESE
[1:19:07] ANGELS ON THE FOUR WINDS HAVE BEEN GIVEN
[1:19:09] A COMMISSION TO DESTROY THE EARTH. IT'S
[1:19:11] ALREADY STARTED. BUT HE RISES UP AND
[1:19:14] SAYS HOLD ON. I STILL GOT SERVANTS. I
[1:19:17] STILL GOT TO SEND AN ELIJAH PROPHET. I
[1:19:19] GOT TO TAKE OUT A GENTILE BRIDE SNEAKER
[1:19:21] AWAY WHILE THE WORLD AIN'T LOOKING AND
[1:19:23] THEN GO GET MY 144,000 OLD FRIENDS. THIS
[1:19:26] WHOLE THING, IT'S IT'S NOT HAPPENING
[1:19:28] SUDDENLY. IT'S HAPPENING IN IN
[1:19:30] SUCCESSION. AND IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR
[1:19:32] DECADES AND EVEN CENTURIES.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE END OF
[1:19:37] THE 19TH CENTURY, MOVING INTO THE 20TH
[1:19:40] CENTURY.
[1:19:42] WE'VE EVEN HAD A MESSAGE AND AND NOW
[1:19:45] WE'RE 50, 60, 70 YEARS MOVING. ISRAEL
[1:19:48] HAS ALREADY IN 1948 DECLARED themselves
[1:19:52] a nation.
[1:19:54] DO YOU KNOW WHAT? AND I HEARD A RABBI
[1:19:56] SAY IT AND I OF COURSE I HAD to research
[1:19:59] IT A LOT. HAD TO DO A LOT OF a lot of
[1:20:01] arduous re. It wasn't that the research
[1:20:04] was difficult. It was just a lot because
[1:20:06] LLMs make it easy, but you still have to
[1:20:09] verify all the sources. and and I and I
[1:20:12] AND SO I I HEARD HIM SAY AND I WENT AND
[1:20:14] RESEARCHED IT AND IT'S SOLID AS
[1:20:16] EVERYTHING THAT ACCORDING TO THE JEWISH
[1:20:19] CALENDAR, BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT A
[1:20:20] JEWISH CALENDAR AND THAT ALL TRADITIONAL
[1:20:23] RABBITIC teaching
[1:20:26] across the board holds that Abraham
[1:20:31] WHO STARTED AS ABRAM
[1:20:34] THAT ABRAHAM WAS born in THE YEAR 1948
[1:20:39] AFTER CREATION.
[1:20:43] called the year of the world.
[1:20:46] AND THEY ACTUALLY TRACK IT USING A
[1:20:49] JEWISH CALENDAR THAT AND I'M GOING TO
[1:20:51] TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT
[1:20:53] STUFF UP. THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS. HOW IS
[1:20:56] IT THAT ABRAHAM IS BORN IN 1948 AFTER
[1:21:00] CREATION AND ISRAEL BECOMES A NATION IN
[1:21:04] 1948? I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,
[1:21:06] FRIENDS. THESE THINGS AREN'T ACCIDENTS.
[1:21:08] WHO'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS SUPPOSED TO
[1:21:10] BE THERE. WHO'S IN THE VATICAN IS
[1:21:11] SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. AND WE WAITED 70
[1:21:14] YEARS FOR A POPE NOT FROM AMERICA, FROM
[1:21:17] THE UNITED STATES.
[1:21:19] AND A MAN BORN IN CHICAGO RISES UP,
[1:21:23] TAKES A DASCESE IN SOUTH AMERICA. SO
[1:21:26] HE'S FROM THE UNITED STATES, HE'S A POPE
[1:21:28] FROM AMERICA. HE'S SEATED ON THE THRONE.
[1:21:31] SOMETHING THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE
[1:21:33] VATICAN, AND EVERYBODY SAID COULD NEVER
[1:21:35] EVER HAPPEN.
[1:21:37] I I WAS READING SO MANY ARTICLES, PEOPLE
[1:21:39] SAYING, "COULD IT BE AN AMERICAN?" AND
[1:21:41] ALL THE EXPERTS WERE SAYING, "IT'S
[1:21:42] IMPOSSIBLE. NO, THE WORLD DOESN'T WANT
[1:21:44] TO GIVE THAT MUCH POWER TO THE UNITED
[1:21:46] STATES." BUT THEY COULDN'T STOP IT
[1:21:48] BECAUSE A PROPHET HAD SAID IT
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S IN THE SCRIPTURE. AND TODAY,
[1:21:52] YOU'RE LIVING [screaming] THE WORD.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; I COULD SAY TO YOU THAT WORD IS NOW MADE
[1:21:58] FLESH.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; And you couldn't disagree.
[1:22:05] SO,
[1:22:07] SO THESE THINGS DON'T SUDDENLY HAPPEN.
[1:22:10] [sighs]
[1:22:11] SO, NOW
[1:22:13] BROTHER BRANDHAM WHEN HE HE GOES INTO
[1:22:15] SHALOM AND THERE'S NO MESSAGE BETTER IN
[1:22:17] MY MIND TO DESCRIBE THIS WHOLE idea
[1:22:22] of you being the voice shout a voice of
[1:22:25] trumpet. We are that voice of the
[1:22:28] message. But God doesn't need you and ME
[1:22:30] TO GO BACK and reshout it. He doesn't
[1:22:32] need the prophet's messages corrected.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; He just needs to get people to believe
[1:22:37] it and THEN HE'LL MOVE INSIDE AND START
[1:22:40] LIVING IT.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S CHRIST WHO DOES ALL THREE.
[1:22:45] IT'S NOT ABOUT BIG EYES'S AND LITTLE
[1:22:47] U'S. IT'S NOT A SUPERCHRISTIAN VERSUS A
[1:22:49] WEAKER CHRISTIAN. IT'S ABOUT CHRIST
[1:22:52] DOING ALL THREE. IT WASN'T WILLIAM
[1:22:54] BRANDHAM'S MESSAGE. IT WAS CHRIST
[1:22:56] ISSUING THE shout through A PROPHET.
[1:22:58] IT'S CHRIST SPEAKING THROUGH THE VOICE
[1:23:00] OF THE BRIDE. IT'S CHRIST WHO IS THE
[1:23:03] VOICE OF THE RESURRECTION THAT WAKES THE
[1:23:05] SLEEPING SAINTS.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; SO THIS CONCEPT OF THE WORD BEING FLESH,
[1:23:11] THE WORD living out AS THE FINAL VOICE
[1:23:15] TO THE FINAL AGE
[1:23:17] AS THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE saying
[1:23:20] something.
[1:23:23] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "REMEMBER THE
[1:23:25] COMPOSER
[1:23:27] KNOWS THE END FROM THE BEGINNING. He
[1:23:30] knows all about it. That's the reason he
[1:23:32] could write it here." See, so what's
[1:23:35] what he's written, HE ALREADY KNOWS IT'S
[1:23:38] going to come to pass. What's in words
[1:23:42] that were in his thoughts THAT ARE NOW
[1:23:44] IN WORDS that are on paper, he, the
[1:23:47] composer, HAS HANDED IT TO A CONDUCTOR.
[1:23:49] And the conductor has gathered people
[1:23:52] who ARE GIFTED TO PLAY THE MUSIC.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; And not the whole WORLD IS, BUT THESE
[1:23:58] people are.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE PAY MONEY TO GO HEAR THEM.
[1:24:01] WHY DON'T EVERYBODY JUST GO DO IT?
[1:24:03] BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO IT. YOU GOT TO BE
[1:24:04] EXTREMELY GIFTED to do that. AND SO
[1:24:06] THEY'RE GIFTED. AND AND SO BROTHER
[1:24:08] BRENNHAM IS NOW CORRELATING. YOU KNOW,
[1:24:10] IT IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE THE THE BEST
[1:24:13] MOST HANDSOME PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, THE
[1:24:15] SMARTEST, THE SMELL THE BEST. HAS
[1:24:18] NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. IT'S THAT YOU
[1:24:20] HAVE A UNIQUE THING CALLED A GENE OF
[1:24:22] GOD. AND IT IS NOT JUST A UH SOMETHING
[1:24:26] DIFFERENT FROM GOD. IT'S ACTUALLY A
[1:24:28] PIECE OF GOD INSIDE OF YOU.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; SO, WHAT I WHAT CAN I DO WITH A LITTLE
[1:24:33] PIECE? IT ONLY TAKES ONE SEED TO GROW A
[1:24:36] WHOLE THING. WELL, HIS WORD MULTIPLIES.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; SO, HE GOES ON. AND HE SAYS, AND HE
[1:24:45] SAYS, YOU MUST BEGIN WITH HIM. IF YOU
[1:24:48] WANT TO HEAR A SYMPHONY. IF YOUR LIFE IS
[1:24:50] GOING TO BE A LIFE SONG, YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:24:53] GET IN THE RHYTHM OF THE COMPOSER. HE
[1:24:56] SAID, YOU BEGIN WITH HIM. LIKE IN MUSIC,
[1:24:58] AT THE AT THE SYMPHONY, YOU LISTEN. YOU
[1:25:00] KNOW WHAT IT SAYS. IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT
[1:25:02] THE SYMPHONY IS. I LOVE THAT. IT'S GOING
[1:25:03] TO BE WHAT THE SYMPHONY IS, not what you
[1:25:05] want to play.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Message don't need players.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The message needs outlets for the
[1:25:14] Holy Spirit to live through.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT THE SYMPHONY IS.
[1:25:20] THEN YOU BEGINNING, YOU BEGIN TO LISTEN
[1:25:22] AT THE MUSIC AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.
[1:25:23] NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO
[1:25:25] COME TO HEAR IT. SEE, NOW NOW WE'RE BACK
[1:25:28] TO OUR LIFE SAYING, "LET HIM THAT IS a
[1:25:30] thirst. Let him come take the waters of
[1:25:33] life freely." That's your music. You're
[1:25:35] playing that and people are coming in to
[1:25:38] what is this strange music? How
[1:25:39] beautiful. You mean there's actually
[1:25:41] hope for me? I I had almost GIVEN UP
[1:25:44] HOPE. I DIDN'T I DIDN'T EVEN THINK THERE
[1:25:45] WAS A REAL GOD. OH, let me just play you
[1:25:48] some more music, friends. Just sit back
[1:25:50] and watch this and see and let it begin
[1:25:53] to change your whole heart. And brother
[1:25:55] Brandham says, you begin to listen and
[1:25:57] you know what it is. YOU KNOW JUST ABOUT
[1:25:59] HERE WHERE CERTAIN THINGS TAKE PLACE.
[1:26:01] NOW IT'S GOT TO CHANGE. SEE, THE MUSIC
[1:26:03] WAS WRITTEN IN ADVANCE BEFORE THEY
[1:26:06] STARTED PLAYING IT. THEY'RE NOT FIGURING
[1:26:08] IT OUT. PROPHECY IS NOT GOD FIGURING IT
[1:26:10] OUT AS HE GOES. THESE THINGS ARE
[1:26:13] HAPPENING IN REAL TIME. TIME IS MEETING
[1:26:16] PROPHECY. AND THAT'S WHY SATAN CANNOT
[1:26:19] STOP IT.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; MY
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; SO HE GOES ON. NOW TO ANYBODY THAT DON'T
[1:26:25] KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE THEY
[1:26:26] JUST WALK IN AND SAT DOWN. IT'S JUST A
[1:26:28] BUNCH OF NONSENSE, rattling noise. I get
[1:26:30] it. They they call us a cult. They call
[1:26:32] us everything. They don't get it. They
[1:26:33] don't understand. Why can't you just
[1:26:35] cooperate? Why can't you just be one of
[1:26:36] the 40,000 different movements? No,
[1:26:38] thank you.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; He says, HE SAYS, "BUT THE ONE WHO KNOWS
[1:26:44] WHAT IT IS,
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; IT'S BEAT OUT WITH THE MUSIC. IT'S
[1:26:47] DRUMED OUT WITH THE NOTES." SEE, CHRIS,
[1:26:50] there is a playing in in the right note.
[1:26:52] Amen. IT'S TRUMPETED WITH THE TRUMPETS.
[1:26:55] IT'S STRUNG ON THE HARP. IT'S PLAYED
[1:26:57] WITH THE VIOLIN. IT'S BEAT ON THE BASS.
[1:26:59] IT'S SOUNDED BY THE TRUMPETS. IT'S BEAT
[1:27:01] ON THE DRUMS. THE NOW WATCH THE WHOLE
[1:27:05] THING. SEE, IT'S THE BODY OF CHRIST
[1:27:08] FITLY JOINED TOGETHER WITH THE WITH WITH
[1:27:11] WITH THE ENERGY THAT EVERY JOINT
[1:27:14] SUPPLIES. GOD HAS SEVERALLY GIFTED THE
[1:27:17] ORCHESTRA AS HE WILL.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THIS IS WHY YOU COME TO
[1:27:21] CHURCH PRAYED UP. THIS IS WHY YOU GO TO
[1:27:24] GOD IN THE MORNING, YOU GO TO HIM AT
[1:27:25] NIGHT, YOU THINK ABOUT HIM ALL DAY LONG
[1:27:27] BECAUSE YOU'RE PLAYING THE MUSIC. AMEN.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; SO THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER, OUR WHOLE
[1:27:36] CHURCH TOGETHER IS A IS A IS IN rhythm
[1:27:41] until and it MAKES THE DRAMA TILL YOU
[1:27:45] CAN CLOSE YOUR eyes and live in it. Now
[1:27:50] when you hear that line read, live in
[1:27:52] it. Don't go from here ever again and
[1:27:55] say, "Brother Jason, I don't really
[1:27:57] think it's anything about living in my
[1:27:58] life. I just think it's I just need to
[1:28:00] tell people God sent a prophet and tell
[1:28:02] them what the doctrine and the teaching
[1:28:04] is and explain the seventh seal. The
[1:28:07] devil can do that
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; better than you can.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; The devil knows who William Brandon was.
[1:28:13] I will promise you.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; And he can explain the seventh seal
[1:28:16] better than most of y'all.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; But but he doesn't believe it. See, he
[1:28:20] knows IT'S TRUE. BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:28:21] ACTUALLY SAID IN ONE PLACE HE ACTUALLY
[1:28:23] BELIEVES, BUT THAT DON'T HE'S NOT
[1:28:25] CONVERTED. SEE, he says he don't make
[1:28:28] believe. He actually believes it. See,
[1:28:31] BUT HE'S NOT CONVERTED. SO HE SAID IT
[1:28:33] MAKES THE DRAMA TILL YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR
[1:28:34] EYES AND LIVE in it. MAN, SEE IF YOU DID
[1:28:38] THAT, IF YOU JUST WOULD do that, THEN IT
[1:28:41] WOULD NOT YOU WOULD NOT
[1:28:44] FEEL LIKE YOU GOT TO JUMP THROUGH RINGS
[1:28:46] OF FIRE TO SAVE YOUR LOST LOVED ONES.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; JUST LIVE IT. AMEN.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; YOU WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE DEVIL
[1:28:54] AND TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS THAT COME UP
[1:28:56] THAT ARE FOR YOUR PERFECTING ANYWAY THAT
[1:28:59] GOD IS GOING TO HARNESS FOR YOUR GOOD
[1:29:01] ANYHOW. AND HE'S GOING TO BRING ALL THE
[1:29:03] THINGS TOGETHER IF YOU'LL JUST WAIT.
[1:29:05] HE'LL MAKE THEM ALL WORK FOR YOUR GOOD.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SEE, SO THE ONLY THING
[1:29:13] YOU CAN DO IF YOU'RE IN THE SYMPHONY,
[1:29:15] YOU BEGIN TO GET INTO THE RHYTHM. THAT'S
[1:29:17] THE WAY YOU DO GOD. YOU DON'T STAND OFF
[1:29:21] AND LOOK AT IT. YOU GET INTO THE RHYTHM
[1:29:22] OF IT. HOW DO YOU GET IN THERE? YOU'RE
[1:29:24] BORN INTO IT. INTO THE RHYTHM OF THE
[1:29:26] WORD. SEE? SO, SO, SO THIS ISN'T ABOUT
[1:29:30] JUST SAYING WORDS. HE SAYS, WHEN YOU
[1:29:32] BECOME part of that word,
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; so everything that we learn in the
[1:29:42] message has to be brought down to the
[1:29:45] here and now. We're not just GATHERING
[1:29:48] INFORMATION AND REJOICING OVER IT. WE DO
[1:29:51] REJOICE OVER IT. BUT BUT BUT WHAT ARE WE
[1:29:54] DOING ABOUT IT?
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; I'm glad you LOVE THE WORD. I'M GLAD YOU
[1:30:01] LOVE PREACHING. I'M GLAD YOU REJOICE AND
[1:30:04] YOU PULL AND YOU SAY SICKLE AND THAT
[1:30:06] MAKES THE PREACHER GO HARDER. BUT BUT
[1:30:08] WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT?
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH, HE SAID BROTHER BRANDON
[1:30:12] SAID OH YOU SAY OH BROTHER BRANDON WE
[1:30:13] SURE ENJOY THAT." HE SAID, "GREAT. NOW,
[1:30:15] WILL YOU do it?"
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; SO, SO SINCE ELECTION THEN SHOWS ME THAT
[1:30:22] I CAME from the word,
[1:30:26] THEN I WAS BORN into this world, a part
[1:30:29] of the word already.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Because the word is eternal. So if I'm a
[1:30:34] part of the word, then that can only
[1:30:36] mean I was born here already. The word,
[1:30:40] you understand? Just waiting for the
[1:30:42] Holy Spirit to bring it to life. So
[1:30:44] therefore true Christianity then is
[1:30:47] rightly so true Christianity
[1:30:51] based on that then if you agree with
[1:30:54] that then true Christianity IS POWER AND
[1:30:58] DEMONSTRATION OF THE WORD YOU CAN'T MAKE
[1:31:02] IT DIFFERENT THAN THAT WHICH IS TO SAY
[1:31:04] THAT MY LIFE SHOULD DEPICT THE POWER AND
[1:31:09] DEMONSTRATION OF WHO I AM IN CHRIST
[1:31:13] JESUS. JESUS.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; SEE, AND SO THE POWER AND DEMONSTRATION
[1:31:18] OF WHAT I SHOULD BE, OF ALL THAT
[1:31:21] [screaming] GOD WANTS ME TO BE. AND
[1:31:23] FRIENDS, I'm right here with you today
[1:31:28] too many times. I I LOOK BACK AT THE
[1:31:31] TRAIL OF MY LIFE JUST IN A GIVEN 24
[1:31:33] HOURS AND I GO, "LORD, IF I'M HONEST,
[1:31:35] and you should be before God, I I I
[1:31:38] DON'T REALLY THAT THAT STRAIGHT LINE OF
[1:31:40] THE WORD, I SEE SOME wobbles and some
[1:31:42] missteps and I tripped there, Lord, and
[1:31:44] I'm awfully sorry about that. You
[1:31:45] forgive me." He will. AND HE'LL CLEANSE
[1:31:48] YOU OF ANY EFFECT OF THE UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
[1:31:50] AND PURIFY you all over again.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; BUT LET'S BE UP AND ABOUT THE FATHER'S
[1:31:55] BUSINESS. YOU CAN'T LET FAILURE KEEP YOU
[1:31:57] DOWN. YOU GOT TO KEEP FIGHTING. I MADE A
[1:32:00] PROMISE TO THE LORD MANY YEARS AGO. I
[1:32:02] CAN'T PROMISE I WON'T STUMBLE, BUT I
[1:32:04] PROMISE I'LL KEEP FIGHTING. I CAN'T
[1:32:06] PROMISE I MIGHT SIDESTEP, [screaming]
[1:32:08] BUT I PROMISE YOU I'LL REPENT. I PROMISE
[1:32:10] YOU I'LL GET BACK UP. I'LL KEEP
[1:32:12] FIGHTING. I'LL NEVER STOP FIGHTING.
[1:32:14] YOU'LL TAKE ME FROM THIS EARTH FIGHTING.
[1:32:17] AMEN.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO THE GOSPEL THEN WE REALIZE THAT
[1:32:25] THE GOSPEL CAME NOT IN WORD ONLY BUT IN
[1:32:27] POWER AND demonstration
[1:32:30] of the divine element of the word that
[1:32:35] is in me.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; I want TO SAY IT LIKE THAT AGAIN. I'VE
[1:32:39] COME INTO THE WORD. SO THE GOSPEL CAME
[1:32:42] NOT INTO THE IN THE CAME NOT IN WORD
[1:32:45] ONLY. I'M I'M I'M I'M taking off on
[1:32:47] PAUL'S STATEMENT. THE GOSPEL CAME NOT IN
[1:32:51] WORD ONLY, IN DOCTRINAL TEACHING ONLY,
[1:32:54] BUT IT CAME IN POWER AND DEMONSTRATION
[1:32:58] OF THE DIVINE ELEMENT THAT'S IN THE WORD
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IN ME THAT I'M BELIEVING THAT I'M
[1:33:04] FEEDING ON THAT I HAVE AN AFFINITY WITH
[1:33:07] THAT THAT THAT PEOPLE CAN GET AROUND ME
[1:33:10] AND THEY CAN JUST CLOSE THEIR EYES AND
[1:33:13] ENJOY THE ETERNAL LIFE THAT flows from
[1:33:16] me.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:18] SO I'VE COME INTO THE WORLD WHERE ARE
[1:33:21] YOU ELECTED?
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE IN ELECTION BY ORIGIN. THEN
[1:33:25] HEAR ME WHEN I SAY I'VE COME INTO THE
[1:33:28] WORLD NOT IN ELECTION ONLY BUT IN THE
[1:33:31] POWER AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE ELECTION
[1:33:33] THAT I'M A PART OF.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Satan with his counter claim.
[1:33:42] I will ascend above the heights of the
[1:33:44] clouds.
[1:33:46] I will be like the most high. Of course,
[1:33:49] brother Brandham and I I'm going to skip
[1:33:50] a lot of this. Brother Brandham talks
[1:33:53] about how that the stars of heaven are
[1:33:54] sons of God. He covers that in um the
[1:33:58] Genesis 15:5 covers it. Job 38 um 6-7
[1:34:03] morning stars are singing together. Um
[1:34:06] and and so so and brother Brandham
[1:34:08] applies the sides of the north would be
[1:34:10] the location of the temple of God's
[1:34:13] presence since Satan THAT JUST SHOWS YOU
[1:34:16] HE'S DESIRING worship
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; because HE WANTS TO SIT IN THE TEMPLE OF
[1:34:20] GOD AND BE LIKE GOD.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; SO LISTEN FRIENDS, LISTEN YOUNG PEOPLE,
[1:34:25] HE DESIRES YOUR WORSHIP AND YOU GIVE IT
[1:34:28] TO HIM WHEN YOU FOLLOW HIS LEAD.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; So I'm not burning incense. I'm not on
[1:34:34] my knees. I'm not uh humming, you know,
[1:34:37] satanic words. That's not He don't need
[1:34:39] that. What? That doesn't even do him ANY
[1:34:42] GOOD. HE'S ALREADY GOT the heathen. The
[1:34:43] ones that's hindering him is you and me.
[1:34:46] He's trying to get you to worship him in
[1:34:49] your lifestyle. SOMETHING THAT BRINGS
[1:34:51] HIM honor and glory. See? AND INSTEAD OF
[1:34:54] OFFERING THE world a well that never
[1:34:56] runs dry, you feed them poison.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:35:01] SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM POINTS OUT IN THE
[1:35:03] IN THE GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE, Satan is
[1:35:06] not called the God of any other age, but
[1:35:08] this age, it was his ambition to be like
[1:35:11] God FROM CATCH THIS NOW. YOU GOOD?
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; YEAH, you heard me in so many weeks. You
[1:35:17] should give me a little liberty.
[1:35:20] [clears throat]
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. MY VOICE IS STARTING TO
[1:35:23] HURT. I'M STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT
[1:35:25] FEVERISH, BUT I WANT TO KEEP PREACHING.
[1:35:27] Can I do that?
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; YOU PROMISE YOU'LL PAY ATTENTION?
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:31] SEE, I'm not going to go too long.
[1:35:33] [clears throat]
[1:35:35] So, Brother Brandham says it was his
[1:35:38] ambition TO BE LIKE GOD. AND HERE'S THE
[1:35:41] key
[1:35:42] from the very beginning.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; See? So, so when he uh So, now think
[1:35:48] with me. Think with me. SO IF IT WAS HIS
[1:35:51] AMBITION TO BE LIKE GOD FROM THE VERY
[1:35:54] BEGINNING,
[1:35:55] THEN WHEN HE APPROACHED EVE FOR THE VERY
[1:35:58] FIRST TIME, it was part of a plan.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; He didn't just walk through the garden
[1:36:05] PASSED BY EVE AND GO, "HM, I got an
[1:36:08] idea." His [snorts] This is This
[1:36:10] predates Genesis. THIS THIS GOES BACK
[1:36:14] WHEN MORNING STARS SANG TOGETHER AND
[1:36:16] SONS OF GOD SHOUTED FOR JOY. THERE WAS
[1:36:18] AN ANGEL who didn't like the way he
[1:36:21] didn't like the system. SOMETHING ABOUT
[1:36:23] IT BOTHERED HIM, STUCK IN HIS CRAWL AND
[1:36:25] he wanted to do something different.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; SO HE DEVELOPS THIS GRAND SCHEME and I'm
[1:36:33] here to TELL YOU THAT THE SCHEME HAS
[1:36:35] PROGRESSED FROM THE PLANNING STAGE. AT
[1:36:38] ONE TIME IN LUCIFER IT WAS IN A PLANNING
[1:36:40] STAGE BUT IT WENT FROM THE PLANNING
[1:36:44] STAGE TO FULLY OPERATIONAL. THAT'S WHAT
[1:36:47] YOU DO IN THE MILITARY. YOU HAVE A PLAN,
[1:36:48] BUT EVENTUALLY YOU'RE GOING TO NOT JUST
[1:36:50] KEEP PLANNING. IT'S GOING TO BECOME
[1:36:52] OPERATIONAL. SEE, and it's going to HAVE
[1:36:54] AN OPERATIONAL STATUS. SO, SO, SO CAN I
[1:36:58] SAY THAT WHEN WHEN WHEN SATAN
[1:37:02] SHOWS UP, AND HE WILL AFTER THIS SERVICE
[1:37:06] IS OVER AND YOU GO HOME, WHEN HE SHOWS
[1:37:09] UP TO TAKE YOU DOWN THAT SAME OLD PATH
[1:37:12] THAT HE ALWAYS TAKES YOU DOWN, JUST SAY
[1:37:14] TO YOURSELF, "THIS WAS A PLAN.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; HE'S TRYING TO SPRING A TRAP ON ME THAT
[1:37:21] HE HAS THOUGHT [screaming] ABOUT FOR
[1:37:22] YEARS.
[1:37:26] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; He fully expects you to come along as
[1:37:30] usual.
[1:37:33] So,
[1:37:35] note to self. Ready to make a note to
[1:37:37] self? NOTE TO SELF. NUMBER ONE,
[1:37:41] this is part of a plan he made right
[1:37:44] while I was sitting in church rejoicing
[1:37:46] over the word.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; NOTE TO SELF. NUMBER TWO,
[1:37:52] this is part of a plan he made that's
[1:37:55] been operational since the day he saw me
[1:37:58] born into the world.
[1:38:00] And if you can just get your mind to
[1:38:02] look at his temptations in that way that
[1:38:05] this is a scheme and a plan to take you
[1:38:07] down, to take him down, to take his
[1:38:08] throne through you, I'm going to tell
[1:38:11] you something. It'll put a lot more
[1:38:12] backbone in you.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad God never needed a planning
[1:38:17] stage like that.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; say he didn't need a planning stage. No,
[1:38:21] brother Brandham said every thought he
[1:38:23] has ever had, he has always had.
[1:38:25] [laughter] Hallelujah. He is immutable.
[1:38:28] He is unable to be changed. Brother
[1:38:31] Brandham said in the in the in THE
[1:38:33] CHURCH AGE BOOK, SATAN KNOWS THAT SINCE
[1:38:36] GOD IS IMMUTABLE IN HIS NATURE, then he
[1:38:39] is just AS IMMUTABLE IN HIS WAYS. SO,
[1:38:43] SO, SO SINCE HIS thoughts uh are his
[1:38:47] word. Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; And his word is unchangeable.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; AND THEN THAT MEANS HIS THOUGHTS OF ME
[1:38:58] are immutable.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS HIS THOUGHTS OF ME ARE
[1:39:03] UNCHANGEABLE.
[1:39:04] LUCIFER CAN SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS. HE
[1:39:07] CAN JUMP UP AND DOWN, THROW DIRT IN THE
[1:39:08] AIR, SET HIMSELF ON FIRE. I DON'T CARE.
[1:39:11] HIS THOUGHTS ARE NOT IMMUTABLE, BUT
[1:39:13] GOD'S THOUGHTS ARE IMMUTABLE. THAT MEANS
[1:39:15] THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE EVER
[1:39:17] TRICKED ME INTO, STUMBLED ME UP, NO
[1:39:19] MATTER WHAT EVER HAPPENED. ALL I HAVE TO
[1:39:21] DO IS REPENT AND GOD CLEANSES ME AND
[1:39:24] FORGIVES ME. AND NOTHING SATAN EVER DOES
[1:39:27] [screaming] IS UNCHANGEABLE IN MY LIFE.
[1:39:30] THE ONLY THING UNCHANGEABLE IS I CAME
[1:39:32] INTO THE WORLD TO LOVE [screaming] GOD.
[1:39:34] AND I CAME INTO THE WORLD TO BELIEVE HIS
[1:39:36] WORD. AND I CAME INTO THE WORLD TO ENJOY
[1:39:38] THE WORLD FOR ETERNITY.
[1:39:46] NOTHING Satan has ever done. I just want
[1:39:48] to I WANT TO SINK THAT IN ON YOU HARD
[1:39:51] BEFORE I GO TO MY LAST POINT for today.
[1:39:53] [sighs and gasps] More to say, but I'm
[1:39:55] going to hit this in one more part.
[1:39:58] Nothing
[1:40:00] that Satan has thought about me.
[1:40:03] You see,
[1:40:05] his thoughts
[1:40:07] are changeable because there's a higher
[1:40:10] power
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; and I'm connected and serve the higher
[1:40:16] power.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; You see friends, his Satan's thoughts
[1:40:20] are not unchangeable. The new birth
[1:40:22] changed everything.
[1:40:25] [snorts]
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; The new birth changed everything.
[1:40:30] Doesn't even matter what he put on me. I
[1:40:31] want you to absorb that today. I don't
[1:40:34] know what sin and failure has caused.
[1:40:37] You may be under the affliction of some
[1:40:39] failure and you brought it on yourself.
[1:40:42] And I'm I'm just going to here to tell
[1:40:44] you something today that even it doesn't
[1:40:48] matter what Satan has ever done, how he
[1:40:50] trapped you, how he tricked you. Nothing
[1:40:52] hangs on to the son and daughter of God.
[1:40:55] ONCE YOU HAVE PASSED FROM DEATH UNTO
[1:40:57] LIFE, AS FAR AS GOD is concerned, YOU
[1:40:59] ARE AS PERFECT as Jesus Christ. You
[1:41:01] might have to live out this life and and
[1:41:03] the sad RESULT OF SOMETHING ELSE. BUT
[1:41:05] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, EVEN GOD CAN JUST
[1:41:07] START SEWING NEW SEED OVER THE TOP OF
[1:41:09] THAT OLD SEED.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. JUST THAT'S WHAT
[1:41:13] THAT'S WHAT HAZARUS DID FOR ESTHER. HE
[1:41:16] COULDN'T CHANGE HIS WORD. GOD CAN'T
[1:41:18] CHANGE HIS WORD. WHATSOEVER YOU SOW,
[1:41:20] THAT'S WHAT YOU REAP. AND SO WHEN ESTHER
[1:41:22] SAYS, "JUST CHANGE THAT." HE SAYS, "I
[1:41:24] CAN'T. I'M I'M A HAZARDOUS AND I CHANGE
[1:41:26] NOT. I'M GOD AND I CHANGE NOT.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; BUT HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO, ESTHER. I'LL
[1:41:30] WRITE A NEW COMMANDMENT. WHAT? WHAT? AND
[1:41:33] ON THE DAY THAT THAT THE SENTENCE IS
[1:41:35] GOING TO BE CARRIED OUT AND YOU'RE GOING
[1:41:36] TO HAVE TO REAP ALL OF THIS TERRIBLE
[1:41:38] CROP THAT'S BEEN SWN AND IT GOT SWN BY A
[1:41:40] TRICKERY BY AN EVIL MAN WHO HATES YOU
[1:41:43] CALLED THE DEVIL. BUT ON THE DAY BEFORE
[1:41:45] HE CAN CARRY IT OUT AND DRAG [screaming]
[1:41:47] YOU OFF TO HELL, BEFORE THAT HAPPENS,
[1:41:50] YOU I'LL ISSUE A NEW LAW THAT YOU CAN
[1:41:52] DESTROY YOUR ENEMIES. SO WHEN THE WHEN
[1:41:55] THE SEED COMES UP, THE EFFECT OF IT HAS
[1:41:57] BEEN DESTROYED. I'M GOING TO HERE TO
[1:41:59] TELL YOU TODAY, JUST START SEWING NEW
[1:42:01] SEED OVER THE TOP OF THAT OLD SEED. AND
[1:42:04] WHEN IT COME
[1:42:08] BY GETTING PEOPLE TO DISBELIEVE HIM, HOW
[1:42:10] MUCH COULD YOU MAKE HIS WORD OF NO
[1:42:12] EFFECT BY BELIEVING THE WORD OF GOD?
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; That includes and is BUT IS NOT LIMITED
[1:42:23] TO HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT ME AND ALSO ABOUT
[1:42:25] YOU.
[1:42:26] THE BIBLE SAYS IN 2 CHRONICLES 16:9,
[1:42:28] "FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD RUN TO AND FRO
[1:42:30] THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE earth to show
[1:42:33] himself strong
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; in the behalf of them whose heart is
[1:42:37] perfect toward him."
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; He has thoughts of all of us,
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; sitting in this tabernacle
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; right now.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; I really want that to sink in. He has
[1:42:52] thoughts. God has thoughts of you. You
[1:42:56] just got out of bed, stumbled into some
[1:42:59] clothes, put on whatever your wife told
[1:43:02] you, grabbed your keys, went out the
[1:43:04] door, came into church. You're sitting
[1:43:06] here today. I'm here to tell you, God
[1:43:09] had angels waiting on you. He knew you
[1:43:12] were coming. He He ordained the word for
[1:43:14] you to preach. I'm here to tell you
[1:43:16] something. If his if his thoughts were
[1:43:18] of me sitting in this tabernacle this
[1:43:20] morning, then he certainly has thoughts
[1:43:21] about me sitting at a table thousands of
[1:43:24] miles long.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. FRIENDS, WHEN WE CAN LOOK
[1:43:27] ACROSS THE AISLE AT ALL OF OUR LOVED
[1:43:29] ONES WHO'VE GONE ON AND WE'RE ALL BACK
[1:43:31] TOGETHER AGAIN AND THROUGH TEARS, WE CAN
[1:43:33] REACH AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WE'LL
[1:43:35] REACH ACROSS AND GRAB ONE ANOTHER. WE
[1:43:37] MADE [laughter] IT. WE MADE IT. WE MADE
[1:43:39] IT. WE MADE IT."
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S NO THOUGHT OF SATAN
[1:43:43] CAN UNDO THAT IN MY LIFE.
[1:43:49] Brother Brandham goes on to show Satan's
[1:43:52] ambition. I don't need to keep going
[1:43:54] over it. I know he he talks about how
[1:43:56] that that scripture Lucifer's son of the
[1:43:58] morning. I will ascend and be in the
[1:44:01] congregation, mount of the congregation
[1:44:02] of the sides of the north was Satan's
[1:44:04] ambition to be ambition to be worshiped
[1:44:07] like God. Um Paul teaches that 2
[1:44:10] Thessalonians 2:4, Psalms 48:2. Daniel
[1:44:14] when he comes to Daniel 11:37,
[1:44:16] neither shall HE REGARD THE GOD of his
[1:44:18] fathers, nor the desire of women, nor
[1:44:20] regard any god, for he shall magnify
[1:44:23] himself above all. SEE TH THIS IS NO
[1:44:27] DOUBT DANIEL I IS IS seeing this WHOLE
[1:44:31] GREAT CONFLICT. JOHN ISAIAH TALKS ABOUT
[1:44:34] THAT HE SAW THE throne room of God in
[1:44:36] Isaiah 6. John saw it in in Revelation
[1:44:40] 4. AND AND SO SO WE FIND OUT THEN THAT
[1:44:43] THAT WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS HE
[1:44:46] CANNOT BE CALLED THE GOD OF ANY OTHER
[1:44:48] AGE BUT THIS AGE. HE SAYS IN THE GOD OF
[1:44:52] THIS EVIL AGE. PARAGRAPH 77. IN WHOM THE
[1:44:55] GOD OF THIS WORLD HATH BLINDED THE MINDS
[1:44:58] OF THEM WHICH believe not lest THE LIGHT
[1:45:00] OF THE GLORIOUS GOSPEL OF CHRIST WHO IS
[1:45:03] THE IMAGE OF GOD
[1:45:05] SHOULD SHINE UNTO THEM. AND HE'S
[1:45:07] REFERENCING, of course, 2 Corinthians
[1:45:09] 4:4. SO, SATAN, NOW WATCH THIS. ALL
[1:45:13] RIGHT, I'm I'm I'm nearing the end. You
[1:45:16] good?
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Can I get 10 minutes? I THINK I GOT 10
[1:45:19] MINUTES OF FUEL LEFT.
[1:45:21] SO, [clears throat]
[1:45:23] so Satan
[1:45:26] was
[1:45:27] beautiful.
[1:45:30] Amen.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; He was
[1:45:34] next level
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; beautiful.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Lucifer.
[1:45:38] Lucifer. There was no angel like him. He
[1:45:40] was an archangel and he was perfect in
[1:45:43] all of his ways and his his beauty was
[1:45:46] remarkable.
[1:45:48] And he WAS HE WAS SECOND ONLY TO THE
[1:45:51] ARCHANGEL MICHAEL. AND SO, SO WE FIND
[1:45:55] THAT THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SHOWS THAT
[1:45:58] SCRIPTURALLY SPEAKING, real beauty is
[1:46:02] holiness.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Real beauty, sisters, brothers, IS NOT
[1:46:08] HOW MUCH MAKEUP YOU CAN PUT ON, DOLL UP,
[1:46:11] TIGHTEN UP YOUR CLOTHES, JACK up your
[1:46:13] heels,
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; sag your pants,
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; LET YOUR HAIR GROW down into into
[1:46:19] bangs.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Trim the ends of your
[1:46:23] hair, color it.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; That's not beauty.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; That's m That's artificial.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Putting all those colored colors that
[1:46:35] are not your NATURAL FINGER AND
[1:46:37] TOENAILS. SHAME ON YOU SISTERS for doing
[1:46:39] things like that. YOU SHOULD NOT DO
[1:46:41] THAT. THAT GRIEVES the Holy Spirit.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; You handle that. You talk that over with
[1:46:45] the Lord. You won't do that. See,
[1:46:48] be real. Beauty means holiness.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; And so,
[1:46:56] SO OF ALL THE ANGELS
[1:46:59] that were beautiful
[1:47:02] in their holiness,
[1:47:04] LUCIFER IS ACTUALLY SINGLED OUT FOR IT.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE EVEN SAID HE WAS JUST PERFECT.
[1:47:14] OTHER TRANSLATIONS, FLAWLESS.
[1:47:17] HE WAS THE PINNACLE OF righteous
[1:47:21] appearing beauty
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; until sin was discovered in him
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; UNTIL IT HE WAS SO ELEVATED
[1:47:33] AND RECOGNIZED AMONG his fellows. YOU
[1:47:37] CAN SEE WHY EXACTLY THAT WHEN [snorts]
[1:47:39] HE ANOINTED PHARISEES Jesus accused them
[1:47:42] of that. They said, he said, "You
[1:47:44] Pharisees, you love to stand in the
[1:47:47] markets. I got your number. YOU THINK
[1:47:51] YOU'RE PIOUS AND HOLY. I KNOW WHAT I
[1:47:53] KNOW YOU'RE full of dead men's bones.
[1:47:55] YOU LOVE STANDING ON THE CORNER AND
[1:47:58] LIFTING UP HOLY PRAYERS AND WEARING YOUR
[1:48:00] long robes and everybody will go, "Oh,
[1:48:02] what a beautifully holy man."
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; And he said, "You're you're you're of
[1:48:06] your father, the devil."
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; And you're murderers and liars. See? AND
[1:48:13] SO, SO IT QUITE NATURALLY
[1:48:17] WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PHARISEES,
[1:48:20] which was legalism,
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; started in Lucifer.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:29] So holiness
[1:48:32] WHEN IT IS HOLINESS FOR THE SAKE OF
[1:48:35] BEING ADMIRED AND [clears throat]
[1:48:38] RECOGNIZED AND AND AND ELEVATED THAT IS
[1:48:42] HOLINESS LEGALISM AND IT'S OF the devil.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? IT'S OF THE DEVIL
[1:48:50] BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. IT BECOMES
[1:48:53] PRIDEFUL LEGALISM AND LUCIFER EXCELLED
[1:48:56] in it. HE HE EXTOLLED IT. HE HE HE
[1:49:00] GLORIFIED IT IN IN ALL OF HIS SERMONS.
[1:49:03] SEE, UN he he he and HE USED TO BROTHER
[1:49:06] BRAM TALKS ABOUT HIM PREACHING PREACHING
[1:49:08] TO THE OTHER ANGELS AND HE HE GLORIFIED
[1:49:11] HIS LEGALISTIC HOLINESS
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; IN THE MINDS OF ALL THE OTHER ANGELS
[1:49:16] UNTIL IT NOT GOD UNTIL HIS LEGALISM
[1:49:20] BECAME praiseworthy among a third of the
[1:49:23] other angels.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a third of the other angels
[1:49:27] fell for prideful legalism
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; and called it beautiful. And brother
[1:49:33] Brandham says that's why they decorate
[1:49:35] their altars and build big crystal
[1:49:36] cathedrals and robe their choirs and all
[1:49:38] the beauty and all the pump and all the
[1:49:41] pageant pageantry that started in heaven
[1:49:45] under Lucifer. Amen.
[1:49:49] The ancient people, Paul said, worshiped
[1:49:52] creation more than the creator until
[1:49:55] finally it would become
[1:49:59] what started in heaven first, a
[1:50:01] denomination of sorts, a cult as it
[1:50:05] were, OF A GRANDIZING BEAUTY. NO LONGER
[1:50:10] A NATURAL PASSION TIED to his love of
[1:50:15] God and his word.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:18] THAT'S WHAT PRIDEFUL LEGALISM IS. It has
[1:50:22] IT IT IT CEASES BEING TIED TO YOUR LOVE
[1:50:26] FOR GOD AND HIS WORD AND IT BECOMES
[1:50:30] PRIDEFUL arrogance
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; where we judge everybody else inferior
[1:50:34] below us who don't keep our standards.
[1:50:37] That is of the devil.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; That is of the devil. Friends, I I'm
[1:50:43] gonna That's why I constantly remind us
[1:50:46] we are all in this thing together.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; There's no big I's and little U's. If he
[1:50:52] had not left us a seed, we too would be
[1:50:55] all together like unto Sodom and
[1:50:57] Gomorrah. I'm going to tell YOU
[1:50:59] SOMETHING, FRIENDS. BETHL TABERNACLE, WE
[1:51:01] HAVE NO ROOM FOR THAT HERE. I'M NOT
[1:51:03] INTERESTED IN PRIDEFUL LEGALISM. I WANT
[1:51:05] PEOPLE WHO LOVE GOD, WHO LOVE HIS WORD.
[1:51:09] I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO OUT HERE AND AND
[1:51:10] WALK A CHALK LINE JUST BECAUSE I SAY YOU
[1:51:12] SHOULDN'T DO IT. WHAT DID I SAY A MINUTE
[1:51:14] AGO? GO PRAY. TALK TO THE HOLY SPIRIT AS
[1:51:17] YOU'RE I DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW YOU AROUND
[1:51:20] AND CHECK ON YOU. I JUST SAY, "LORD GOD,
[1:51:22] HOLY GHOST, YOU FOLLOW THEM AROUND. YOU
[1:51:24] CHECK ON THEM. YOU TALK TO THEM.
[1:51:26] [screaming] TALK TO THEM WHEN THEY WAKE
[1:51:27] UP. TALK TO THEM WHEN THEY GO TO SLEEP.
[1:51:29] I'LL SEE YOU COME IN THAT DOOR. AND THE
[1:51:31] BEAUTY OF HOLINESS WILL BE ON YOU HERE.
[1:51:33] IT'LL BE ON YOU THERE. IT'LL BE ON YOU
[1:51:36] EVERYWHERE YOU GO.
[1:51:39] AMEN.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:51:42] ABSOLUTELY.
[1:51:48] The world as I I'm I'm to my final point
[1:51:51] now.
[1:51:53] THE WORLD IS FACING A CLIMAX.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Dueling claims
[1:52:01] to a single throne.
[1:52:05] Dueling claims
[1:52:08] TO A SINGLE DOMINION.
[1:52:11] Dueling claims TO A SINGLE POSITION THAT
[1:52:17] ONLY ONE OF these two beings
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; can accomplish.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:52:23] I THINK ABOUT Lucifer
[1:52:27] when he
[1:52:29] AND I I'M PROBABLY JUST NOW COMING TO
[1:52:31] THE real burden on my heart and it won't
[1:52:33] take me long to get it out because it's
[1:52:35] just such a reality
[1:52:39] WHEN I THINK OF LUCIFER there in all of
[1:52:42] his beauty,
[1:52:45] all of his pride
[1:52:47] and his his egotism and his pomp and a
[1:52:51] and how everything just turned into a
[1:52:53] cult and a denomination that he preached
[1:52:57] his way as a false prophet and a third
[1:52:59] of the angelic host followed him in it.
[1:53:02] Don't think it's not a powerful
[1:53:03] doctrine. It's very powerful. I've seen
[1:53:05] it destroy churches before.
[1:53:08] IT NEVER I JUST SAID TO MYSELF SOME
[1:53:11] WEEKS AGO, it never OCCURRED TO SATAN
[1:53:14] WHEN HE STOOD BESIDE that throne to
[1:53:18] notice
[1:53:19] that as the Bible says, his throne is
[1:53:23] established in mercy
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; WHEN AS YET THERE WAS NO NEED TO BE
[1:53:31] MERCIFUL.
[1:53:34] NOTHING WAS LOST. NOTHING WAS WRONG. SIN
[1:53:38] DIDN'T YET EXIST.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IN HIS FORNOWLEDGE BUILD A
[1:53:43] THRONE OUT OF MERCY.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING SO ARROGANT AND
[1:53:51] SELFADMIRING
[1:53:52] AND SO PRIDEFUL AND SO SELF ASSURED THAT
[1:53:57] YOU WERE BLIND TO REDEMPTION? IMAGES OF
[1:54:00] REDEMPTION ALL AROUND YOU. AND THERE WAS
[1:54:04] NOTHING EVEN LOST. AND IT DIDN'T EVEN
[1:54:06] OCCUR TO LUCIFER. BUT GOD KNEW WHEN HE
[1:54:08] SAID TO ADAM, "UH, RE MULTIPLY AND
[1:54:11] REPLENISH THE EARTH." AND BROTHER SAID,
[1:54:12] "IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, SOMETHING
[1:54:14] WOULD HAVE TO DIE." GOD [screaming]
[1:54:16] ALREADY KNEW HE WOULD BE A REDEEMER. HE
[1:54:18] ALREADY KNEW YOU'D BE BORN IN SIN. HE
[1:54:21] ALREADY KNEW HE'D SEND A MESSAGE. HE
[1:54:23] ALREADY KNEW I'D BE A BELIEVER. HE
[1:54:25] ALREADY KNEW YOU WOULD TAKE IT. HE
[1:54:27] ALREADY KNEW YOU'D BECOME A WORSHSHIPER
[1:54:29] OF THE TRUE GOD. [screaming]
[1:54:31] AND SATAN CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW HE
[1:54:34] DOESN'T HAVE YOU AND HE STUMBLED YOU AND
[1:54:36] TRIPPED YOU AND BEAT YOU. BUT HERE YOU
[1:54:39] STAND TODAY. [screaming]
[1:54:40] YOU'RE STILL A BELIEVER AND YOU'RE STILL
[1:54:42] STANDING. YOU'RE STILL MOVING FORWARD.
[1:54:45] AND THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN DO ABOUT IT
[1:54:47] [screaming]
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HIS THRONE WAS ESTABLISHED IN
[1:54:52] MERCY.
[1:54:55] AND I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TODAY, FRIENDS,
[1:54:57] DON'T KEEP GOING DOWN THE PRIMROSE PATH
[1:55:00] THAT SATAN HAS TOLD YOU YOU CAN HAVE
[1:55:02] YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO. THE WORLD IS
[1:55:04] YOUR OYSTER. THIS WORLD HAS NOTHING LIKE
[1:55:07] AN OYSTER. THIS WORLD HAS NOTHING ABOUT
[1:55:10] CAKE AND DESSERT. THIS WORLD IS GOING TO
[1:55:13] FIRE [screaming] AND BRIMSTONE IS GOING
[1:55:15] TO BE RAIN DOWN UPON IT. AMEN.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Not only a nuclear fire, but holy fire.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; AND GOD TODAY
[1:55:30] is speaking to hearts TO SAY THERE'S NO
[1:55:34] future in a life apart from God's word.
[1:55:40] I don't care what plans you have made.
[1:55:43] Satan, listen, Satan didn't catch it. He
[1:55:45] he literally he literally missed the
[1:55:49] grandest part in creation. And you know
[1:55:53] what that was? Redemption.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; He never figured
[1:55:59] that something could be lost and already
[1:56:02] purchased before it was born
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; so that when it was born it would
[1:56:07] already come up born in sin but with a
[1:56:10] gene that the Holy Spirit could come and
[1:56:13] take it back.
[1:56:14] And that's the part he never counted on.
[1:56:18] Oh, now as we read now the universe can
[1:56:23] be filled with the glory of God. As Paul
[1:56:26] said in Romans 11, for of him and
[1:56:29] through him and to him are all things.
[1:56:34] To whom be glory forever. So, Satan and
[1:56:39] God both making claims to lordship and
[1:56:44] kingdom and the choice is easy. God
[1:56:48] leaves it to every man and woman to make
[1:56:50] their choice. There's two leaders.
[1:56:54] They're making polar opposite claims.
[1:56:56] The world seems to be, you'd almost
[1:56:59] think that you better put in with the
[1:57:02] devil because the whole world is given
[1:57:04] over to it. And it looks like and he's
[1:57:06] the god of this evil age and he's got
[1:57:08] Satan's Eden and it just looks like you
[1:57:11] you could just go right on forever. But
[1:57:13] I'm here to tell you something, young
[1:57:14] people. Listen to me. He's got nothing
[1:57:16] ahead of you but darkness, misery,
[1:57:20] slavery,
[1:57:23] poverty, brokenness. But I'm here to
[1:57:26] tell you, there's a redeemer.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Stand to your feet with me today.
[1:57:32] There's a redeemer, friends. And that is
[1:57:35] what Satan cannot account for. He cannot
[1:57:39] account for the fact that you can walk
[1:57:41] into this building today, a black,
[1:57:44] smutty, dark sinner, and leave here
[1:57:49] clean, righteous, true holiness, true
[1:57:53] purity. How many would like that kind of
[1:57:56] an exit today? Why don't you bow your
[1:57:58] heads with me all over the building?
[1:58:01] Father,
[1:58:03] I come to the end of this sermon today,
[1:58:05] Lord. And I'm quite finished from where
[1:58:08] I wanted to get to. And I'm grateful to
[1:58:10] you, grateful to the people.
[1:58:17] And Lord, I just committed to you. I I I
[1:58:20] I've preached the word as honest as I
[1:58:23] could. I've been as forthright. I've
[1:58:26] held nothing back. Every moment as I'm
[1:58:29] going through my notes and the Holy
[1:58:31] Spirit prompted me to inject something
[1:58:33] fresh. I didn't disobey you. I said it.
[1:58:35] I didn't understand everything I said. I
[1:58:37] don't even know what all I said, but I
[1:58:39] know it was of you.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; So I pray today, Lord, there's young and
[1:58:45] old here alike. There's sinner and saint
[1:58:47] here alike. There's those who who have
[1:58:50] known you.
[1:58:53] They've known you. They've had
[1:58:55] experiences with you. I wouldn't doubt
[1:58:57] that at all.
[1:58:59] But they're still lacking that [snorts]
[1:59:01] certain [music] something,
[1:59:03] that one moment in your presence that
[1:59:07] changes everything. [music]
[1:59:10] It's not just a feeling. It's not just a
[1:59:13] sensation. It doesn't last more. It
[1:59:15] lasts more than a couple days. It'll
[1:59:18] literally go with them all the way to
[1:59:21] glory. I pray today, Lord. I pray for
[1:59:25] THE YOUNG AND THE OLD. I PRAY FOR THE
[1:59:27] married and the single. I pray sinner
[1:59:29] and saint. I PRAY THAT WE WILL ALL
[1:59:32] UNDERSTAND a little better today what it
[1:59:35] is that you are desiring. To the
[1:59:37] believer,
[1:59:39] our life is supposed to be a beacon.
[1:59:43] It's supposed to be a voice to the world
[1:59:46] that can bring the dying and the thirsty
[1:59:48] to you.
[1:59:50] That's what our life as a believer is
[1:59:52] supposed to be,
[1:59:55] Lord. To the sinner who has never
[1:59:57] surrendered his heart to you fully. It's
[2:00:00] so easy to do. Satan clouds it, muddies
[2:00:04] the water, makes it complicated.
[2:00:06] They They think they have to do some
[2:00:08] certain thing, have some certain
[2:00:10] reaction, they're going to have to
[2:00:12] change this about their life or give up
[2:00:13] that or quit this. They don't have to do
[2:00:15] any of that. All they have to do is
[2:00:18] surrender. say, "Lord Jesus, not only do
[2:00:22] not only do is the preacher telling me I
[2:00:24] don't need to do that, I don't even
[2:00:26] think I could do that." And even if I
[2:00:28] did, it wouldn't last. Lord, I need
[2:00:30] something that'll last. I pray, master,
[2:00:33] that you'll speak to hearts right now.
[2:00:36] Sinner boy, sinner girl, IF YOU DON'T
[2:00:38] know the Lord, and maybe you've known
[2:00:40] him, you've known of him, BUT IF YOU'VE
[2:00:42] NEVER REALLY KNOWN HIM IN THAT THING,
[2:00:43] THAT'LL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER. WHY
[2:00:46] DON'T YOU JUST RAISE UP THAT HAND TO him
[2:00:47] right now? Say, "Lord God, be merciful
[2:00:49] to me, a sinner. BE MERCIFUL TO ME. I'VE
[2:00:52] I'VE EXPERIENCED YOU. I'VE KNOWN YOU.
[2:00:54] BUT I NEED THAT CERTAIN CERTAIN
[2:00:56] SOMETHING THAT PUTS ME IN THE PATH OF
[2:00:59] RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE."
[2:01:02] LORD, I pray that sinner and saint will
[2:01:05] move up a level today. That the
[2:01:07] righteous will move up a level. THAT
[2:01:09] YOUR FAMILY WILL INCREASE THEIR
[2:01:11] DEDICATION TO YOU. and those who haven't
[2:01:13] known you will know you in in your power
[2:01:17] and in your resurrection.
[2:01:20] I commit it to you today. That's why we
[2:01:22] preach, Lord. That's why that throne was
[2:01:26] established in mercy. I know the devil
[2:01:28] might be telling them, "It's too late.
[2:01:30] You've gone too far. You're too broken.
[2:01:32] Are you even sure you even want that?"
[2:01:34] Lord, that's the whole reason you built
[2:01:36] a throne out of mercy. My goodness, you
[2:01:40] could have built it out of anything. You
[2:01:42] established your throne in mercy. That
[2:01:46] was THE WHOLE YOU PREPARED THE GROUND
[2:01:49] CAREFULLY. You built it with care. You
[2:01:52] put IT IN PLACE. YOU BUILT YOUR THRONE
[2:01:54] IN such a way
[2:01:57] that the sinner no matter what condition
[2:01:59] his life in his life is in, he can come
[2:02:02] and kneel before that throne and say,
[2:02:04] "God, be merciful to me." and you can
[2:02:09] and Satan can't hold him any longer. I
[2:02:12] commit it to you, Father. I've preached,
