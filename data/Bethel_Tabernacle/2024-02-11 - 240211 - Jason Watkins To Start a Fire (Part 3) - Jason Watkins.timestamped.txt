[32:47] series I turned into that I thought I
[32:50] finished it with the last installment
[32:53] but we're going to go with part three of
[32:55] to start a fire
[32:57] amen let's read from Luke chapter
[33:04] 3 I will um yeah let's just read this
[33:09] Luke 3 and beginning at verse three now
[33:13] this is the story of John the Baptist
[33:15] all
[33:16] right you know verse one and verse two
[33:19] deals with who was in charge of the
[33:21] government what was going on and who was
[33:22] Caesar and who was King and all that and
[33:24] it's uh coming to John verse three and
[33:26] he came into all the country round about
[33:30] Jordan the country about Jordan
[33:32] preaching the baptism of
[33:34] repentance for the remission of
[33:38] sins as it is written in the book of the
[33:41] words of Isaiah the prophet saying the
[33:43] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[33:47] prepare ye the way of the Lord make his
[33:51] paths
[33:52] straight every Valley shall be filled
[33:56] and Every Mountain and Hill shall be
[33:59] brought low that's pretty descriptive
[34:01] would you agree and yet nothing like
[34:05] that
[34:07] happened look at it again every Valley
[34:10] shall be filled and every mountain and
[34:13] Hill shall be brought low and the
[34:16] Crooked shall be made straight and the
[34:19] rough ways shall be made smooth I tell
[34:23] you um you know he he's quoting the Old
[34:26] Testament Prophet who obviously must
[34:28] have been a false
[34:30] prophet because none of this happened
[34:33] like like you would
[34:36] think amen praise the Lord now breathe
[34:41] just
[34:42] breathe you'll be okay all right it's
[34:46] all good amen praise the Lord verse six
[34:51] and All Flesh shall see the salvation of
[34:54] God then said he to the multitude that
[34:58] came forth to be baptized of him old
[35:01] Generation of Vipers who hath warned you
[35:05] to flee from the Wrath to come bring
[35:08] forth therefore fruits worthy of
[35:12] repentance and begin not to say within
[35:15] yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father
[35:19] for I say unto you that God is able of
[35:22] these stones to raise up children unto
[35:25] Ahab let me read that let that verse
[35:28] again verse 8 don't just come to church
[35:31] and say you're a message
[35:33] believer and don't just come in and
[35:36] pretend to be one of God's
[35:38] family don't begin to say within
[35:41] yourselves well I'm
[35:42] elected God is able to raise up of
[35:45] stones children to Abraham you need to
[35:48] come with
[35:49] repentance and show meat fruit of
[35:52] repentance that's why you come to church
[35:56] man verse n and now also the axe is laid
[36:00] unto the root of the trees every tree
[36:03] therefore which bringeth not forth good
[36:05] fruit is heun down and cast into the
[36:08] fire the Old Testament is replete with
[36:11] examples of trees being symbolic of
[36:14] humans amen amen David said I'm an aloe
[36:17] tree I'm a palm tree you know about the
[36:19] trees in the Garden of Eden one was
[36:21] Christ and one was Satan right all right
[36:25] so um
[36:27] verse
[36:28] 10 and the people ask him
[36:32] saying what shall we do then he anth and
[36:36] said unto them he that hath two coats
[36:39] let him impart to him that hath none and
[36:41] him he that hath meat let him do
[36:44] likewise in other words don't keep your
[36:47] your your blessing of God in the new
[36:49] birth to yourself amen we share the the
[36:52] blessing of God don't we then came also
[36:55] publicans to be baptized and said unto
[36:57] him Master what shall we do he said unto
[37:00] them exact no more than that which is
[37:02] appointed you and the soldiers likewise
[37:05] demanded of him saying and what shall we
[37:07] do see everybody had something to do the
[37:11] lesson is when you're born again you got
[37:12] something to do now you got a mission
[37:15] now you're somebody see now you're
[37:18] actually living brother Ram says before
[37:20] the New Birth you're just
[37:21] dying amen am amen UAH you're GNA see
[37:25] here in a minute how the Holy Spirit
[37:28] instigated that conversation last night
[37:31] amen you're gonna see it just in a
[37:36] minute again verse 14 and the soldiers
[37:39] likewise demanded of him saying and what
[37:42] shall we do and he said unto them do
[37:44] violence to no man neither accuse any
[37:47] falsely and be content with your wages
[37:50] so the gospel changes your life it
[37:53] doesn't leave you like it did you agree
[37:56] and as the the people were in
[37:59] expectation and can I can I just
[38:01] interrupt myself and and say that please
[38:06] realize you're reading the ministry of
[38:10] Elijah and Elijah's Ministry was that
[38:14] the Holy Ghost changes your life and you
[38:17] can't say I'm a Christian without being
[38:20] unless you actually live like a
[38:22] Christian and for that kind of approach
[38:26] the people of Elijah's day the king the
[38:28] government everybody hated him so oh no
[38:31] they loved him they killed him for the
[38:34] same reason they hated the tishbite for
[38:36] the same reason that they hate the
[38:38] Elijah of this day because it would not
[38:41] walk among those systems and just leave
[38:43] them like they were it would blow them
[38:45] up right amen all right and the people
[38:50] verse now
[38:52] watch verse 15 and the people were in
[38:55] expectation
[38:57] and all men mused in their hearts of
[39:00] John whether he were the Christ or not
[39:04] John answered saying unto them all I
[39:08] indeed baptize you with water now I'm
[39:10] coming to my title see to start a fire
[39:14] and today I'm going to take a subt a
[39:18] subtitle starting and finishing with
[39:22] fire amen right and John answered verse
[39:26] 16 saying unto them all I indeed baptize
[39:29] you with water but one mightier than I
[39:34] cometh the latchet of whose shoes I am
[39:37] not worthy to unloose he shall baptize
[39:41] you with the Holy Ghost and with fire
[39:45] whose fan is in his hand and he will
[39:48] thoroughly Purge his floor and will
[39:51] gather the wheat into his Garner but the
[39:54] chaff he will burn with fire
[39:59] unquenchable First Kings chap 10 1 verse
[40:05] if they can just put it on the screen
[40:06] you won't have to race there in your
[40:08] Bibles we're just going to catch one
[40:09] verse First Kings
[40:12] 10:27 and the King made silver to be in
[40:16] Jerusalem as stones and Cedars made he
[40:19] to be as the sycamore trees that are in
[40:23] the veil for
[40:24] abundance amen may the Lord bless the
[40:28] reading of his word you can be
[40:32] seated amen praise the
[40:37] Lord amen been enjoying this fine Spring

[43:08] been in Ukraine I can't remember we
[43:09] might have been in Russia for all I I
[43:11] don't really remember where we were
[43:12] somewhere in those Slavic countries or
[43:14] one of those Baltic states and we are
[43:17] driving by a a cemetery large cemetery
[43:20] and it was so large and imposing it

[43:25] looked and he said he saw me you know
[43:27] brother Nikolai you remember a crusty
[43:29] old brother amen and he said something
[43:31] in Russian and I and I looked at the
[43:34] translator and he said brother Nikolai
[43:36] said those people don't need your
[43:40] help and I said okay what do they need
[43:43] and he said they need
[43:45] life you drive by a graveyard they don't
[43:47] need your help they need life I'm not
[43:51] here today say brother help me I the
[43:54] best way I can help you is to lead you
[43:55] to life amen there you know I've said it
[43:59] before that the life here with all of
[44:03] its trials and heartaches and then you
[44:06] live and you strive and you struggle and
[44:09] even if you make the great as brother
[44:11] Ernie used to say even if you win the
[44:13] rat race you're still a rat and then the
[44:16] whole thing comes down and finally you
[44:18] grow old and Rusty and
[44:21] die and that's it and you're done I mean
[44:24] you know remember you remember when I
[44:27] put the blocks of weeks up here to show
[44:30] you I mean your whole life if you base
[44:32] your whole life on the promised 70 now
[44:35] we we've got some in here who have
[44:37] exceeded 70 and some we've known have
[44:40] never made it to 70 some brother
[44:42] brandham said many a 16-year-old never
[44:44] saw their 17th birth but if we use the
[44:48] promise the promised years of 70 I mean
[44:51] listen up young people that's only 3,600

[45:13] little over 3600 weeks on average to

[49:56] deliver this word to the people today we
[49:58] commit it to you in Jesus name amen God
[50:01] bless you you can be
[50:13] seated last
[50:15] night um Uriah and I were talking he's
[50:18] in from school for the weekend get gets
[50:21] to be with us today so happy to have him
[50:23] here we were we struck up a conversation
[50:27] between himself his dad and myself and
[50:31] on the use of the word ironic or which
[50:35] is which is uh that's an adjective of
[50:38] the noun irony and so irony refers to a
[50:43] situation or statement that is opposite
[50:48] or different from what is expected or
[50:52] intended I want to say that again I
[50:55] refers to a situation or statement that
[50:59] is opposite or different from what is
[51:02] expected or or intended and a lot of
[51:07] times people
[51:10] are shall I say
[51:13] mystified even at times
[51:16] offended at God for the way he moves in
[51:21] their lives the way he deals with us the
[51:25] the things that he allows and a lot of
[51:27] times I remember one time some years ago
[51:30] and I made a statement and we were uh
[51:32] speaking to a senior Minister much
[51:34] senior to me this was some years back
[51:36] and um and I said you know it's
[51:40] sometimes it's surprises me that will
[51:43] God will do certain things and he says
[51:45] to me and thought it was such wisdom I
[51:47] learned a quick lesson never forgot it
[51:49] he said remember brother Jason sometimes
[51:52] it's better not to say God did it but to
[51:54] say God permitted it God allowed it to
[51:58] happen but brother brandham said that
[52:00] the love of God is made known to us and
[52:02] made clear and made plain in election
[52:06] that he elected us amen he said
[52:10] sometimes he may he may commit you to
[52:13] suffering as he did
[52:15] Paul amen he or or death I mean he said
[52:19] he may cons he may commit you to
[52:21] suffering as he did job or he may commit
[52:23] you to death as he did Paul PA but he
[52:27] says but nonetheless his his love is
[52:30] proven to us in that before the
[52:32] foundation of the world he elected Us in
[52:35] the elected son in Christ Jesus and that
[52:39] means friends that no matter what you
[52:41] would ever face what you would ever lose
[52:44] on this side
[52:47] um you've got a your future is
[52:51] bright
[52:53] amen and so we were reading in our text
[52:57] and I I stopped to hesitate on it there
[53:00] in verse 5 every Valley shall be filled
[53:03] and every mountain and high hill shall
[53:05] be brought low and the Crooked shall be
[53:08] made straight and the rough ways shall
[53:10] be made smooth and All Flesh shall see
[53:12] the salvation of God uh it's amazing
[53:15] because you know
[53:18] ironically uh none of that happened like
[53:21] the people thought right amen they and
[53:24] brother brandham deals with that now I
[53:26] don't want you to forget this morning
[53:29] that my subtitle is starting and
[53:34] finishing with fire I remember back in
[53:37] the day brother Henry green an old
[53:39] veteran of the Lord it was a hero of
[53:41] mine when I was growing up he always
[53:44] used to say referring to the upper room
[53:47] that what we call the day of Pentecost
[53:50] and he said he he said God he said
[53:53] Christ in the upper room he started his
[53:56] church like he wanted it and now he
[54:00] wants it like he started
[54:03] it amen he started his church like he
[54:07] wanted it and now he wants it like he
[54:11] started it this is exactly why we have a
[54:15] received a message of
[54:18] restoration we've been restored back to
[54:21] now
[54:23] ironically the message of restoration
[54:26] was not what the denominations of the
[54:29] last day were expecting it to be amen
[54:32] they were expecting it to just be the
[54:35] the excesses and
[54:37] demonstration of Supernatural power and
[54:41] brother brandham said everybody wants
[54:44] power and he says but really they don't
[54:48] really know what real power is amen he
[54:51] said you know he says real power
[54:55] is not you know how much noise you can
[54:58] make or how much dust you can kick up
[55:00] and I'm paraphrasing the quote I don't
[55:02] have it in front of me he said but the
[55:04] real battle is to conquer
[55:07] yourself and he said to to be able to
[55:10] surrender yourself to God and let the
[55:13] Lord have control of your life and bring
[55:17] out of you what he put in you to be
[55:19] brought
[55:20] out now it it's not as if you're not
[55:23] already in a bad enough
[55:26] situation given that you were born in
[55:28] sin given that you might have had things
[55:31] happen to you when you were a child
[55:33] given that you might have come up in a
[55:35] culture and had the wrong kind of
[55:36] friends and put all kinds of influences
[55:39] and scars in your life given that you
[55:41] maybe didn't make all the good choices
[55:43] even when you knew
[55:45] better and given that you finally
[55:47] arrived I'm here to tell you by the time
[55:50] Jesus tracks you down knocks you down
[55:55] and picks you back up you're a
[55:58] mess you're broken you're contaminated
[56:02] you're scarred you're wounded you've got
[56:04] haunts you've got uh bruises in your
[56:07] spirit you've got you're filled with
[56:10] complexes amen now don't get offended
[56:13] brother brandham said we all got
[56:15] complexes and that comes through to us
[56:17] some of it comes through heredity
[56:20] brother Brandon meets people in the line
[56:21] says you're always worrying about things
[56:24] you're grandmother was like that comes
[56:26] to a man sir you're always Crossing
[56:28] Bridges before you get to them and and
[56:31] when you finally get to them you realize
[56:33] it wasn't near as bad as you thought it
[56:35] would
[56:36] be see but he said but he put that into
[56:39] the grab bag of Life what he called and
[56:42] so and then you know you might have had
[56:45] uh poor leadership as a child poor
[56:47] leadership in a church poor leadership
[56:50] somewhere and and and you come to the
[56:52] Lord and I mean you you listen it's
[56:55] already bad enough without you now still
[56:59] running interference on the Lord not
[57:02] letting him after your new birth bring
[57:05] you to to the fullness the fruition of
[57:08] the vision he had for you amen you say
[57:11] well it's too late on some of these
[57:13] areas there's no way there's things in
[57:15] my life unrecoverable you might have
[57:19] situations that are unrecoverable that's
[57:22] true I mean sometimes we get ourselves
[57:25] into situations of life and there's no
[57:29] way to undo it in this life I'm glad
[57:32] that all wrongs here will be made right
[57:36] there
[57:38] Hallelujah and so so we find that you
[57:42] know
[57:43] he sometimes we can we can Despair and
[57:47] say oh would to God that I could have
[57:50] been this and done that and if I hadn't
[57:53] made this and brother brandham talks
[57:54] about about Moses in the very same
[57:56] situation 80y old man and 40 years in
[58:00] Egypt learning the ways of the Egyptians
[58:02] and God said then it took God 40 years
[58:05] in the desert to beat it out of him and
[58:07] when he comes ready to finally use him
[58:10] as far as God is concerned he's finally
[58:13] got him ready as far as Moses is
[58:16] concerned brother brandham said that he
[58:18] stood there one day and he thought about
[58:20] his life in Egypt and what a waste and
[58:23] what a a rain wreck it had been and he
[58:26] thought about now 40 years in the
[58:28] wilderness and he's just basically
[58:30] hurting sheep who aren't even his they
[58:32] belong to his daddy-in-law and you know
[58:34] and he and brother brandham says that
[58:37] you know and I'm so glad a prophet could
[58:38] look into the heart of another prophet
[58:40] and say you know Moses stood there
[58:42] thinking but I've ruined it and I've
[58:45] I've made a mess of it and it's too late
[58:47] for me now he was just getting ready to
[58:49] start and he's standing there thinking
[58:52] it's too late for me now and brother
[58:55] brandham said the great Crystal tears
[58:57] began to roll down his beard and then he
[58:59] heard the sound of a crackling
[59:02] flame oh friends I want to tell you
[59:05] today that Jesus promised that that not
[59:08] only would he lose no body whose names
[59:11] were in the Lamb's Book of Life but he
[59:13] doesn't lose anything about you whatever
[59:16] he ordained you to be and whatever he
[59:19] placed in you I don't care what you've
[59:20] done what Satan's done what your parents
[59:23] preachers whoever did did what to you
[59:25] I'm here to tell you this message has
[59:27] come to give it back and to build you
[59:30] back and I don't care if you got one
[59:33] year or 10 years or however long the
[59:35] Lord has you can run for the kingdom of
[59:38] God and everything you do counts times
[59:43] 100 so so the devil can't win for
[59:47] losing poor
[59:50] guy he could actually win if he wasn't
[59:52] always losing
[59:56] so I want to say this to you today
[1:00:01] that that I want to PR I want to present
[1:00:05] a thought to you today that let us not
[1:00:09] imagine that we're just being restored
[1:00:14] back to an upper room
[1:00:16] experience we're being restored to a
[1:00:18] Garden of Eden hallelujah we're being
[1:00:21] restored back to when sons of God when
[1:00:24] morning Stars sang together we being
[1:00:27] restored back to when sons and daughters
[1:00:29] in the family of God shouted for Joy
[1:00:32] we're being restored back to when we
[1:00:34] stood before the father's throne and all
[1:00:36] was well throughout the kingdom of
[1:00:39] Christ I'm here to tell you something
[1:00:41] friends don't let the devil make you
[1:00:43] feel hopeless he ain't nobody he ain't
[1:00:46] never been nobody he's just an adversary
[1:00:49] that God built to help keep you in line
[1:00:53] death is I'm not the slave SL of death
[1:00:55] brother brandham said death is my
[1:00:57] slave it is commanded to do one thing
[1:01:01] and that is to take me into the presence
[1:01:03] of
[1:01:05] God so we are we're not limited to the
[1:01:10] New Testament Church that he started in
[1:01:12] the upper room however that is where you
[1:01:15] need to begin your journey
[1:01:18] home don't have brother brandham taught
[1:01:21] us that that that church at Jerusalem
[1:01:24] that upper room experience set the
[1:01:27] pattern for the church in every age amen
[1:01:32] all right but I want to say to you today
[1:01:35] that we're not limited uh to the New
[1:01:38] Testament Church he started in the upper
[1:01:40] room but we but what you are entitled to
[1:01:44] is to go back to the church that he
[1:01:47] began in John
[1:01:49] 1:1 in the beginning was the word and
[1:01:53] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:01:55] God and the same was with God in the
[1:01:57] beginning all things were made by him
[1:02:00] see so when he said as brother brandham
[1:02:03] taught us when he said in Genesis let us
[1:02:07] make man brother brandham is very clear
[1:02:11] that when he said let us make man he
[1:02:14] made up his entire family in his mind
[1:02:17] right then now they weren't expressed
[1:02:18] yet and brother brandham did not believe
[1:02:21] in the pre-existence of Souls manifested
[1:02:24] expressed Souls says you were in the
[1:02:27] attributes of your father God you were
[1:02:30] there so he said but he you weren't
[1:02:33] expressed so he had never got to
[1:02:35] fellowship with you just like and he he
[1:02:37] brings it down to the lower image of a
[1:02:40] husband and wife bringing forth a child
[1:02:42] so I I was in my father but he couldn't
[1:02:45] fellowship with with me until through
[1:02:48] the beding ground of my mother I was
[1:02:51] expressed and I came from the Lo of my
[1:02:55] father and then he could Fellowship me
[1:02:57] amen and so that's why you're here
[1:03:00] that's why you have life is because God
[1:03:04] desired your fellowship Own It rejoice
[1:03:09] in it smack the devil with it God
[1:03:12] brought you here so he could have
[1:03:14] fellowship with
[1:03:18] you so we're talking about how that he
[1:03:23] says let us make man he makes up his
[1:03:25] entire family in his mind so he would
[1:03:28] bring them forth just as he brought
[1:03:30] forth his first member of his church his
[1:03:34] first member of his church was Christ
[1:03:37] see and so then after Christ each child
[1:03:41] in Christ comes forth in the order that
[1:03:45] he is ordained or as Paul said in 1
[1:03:47] Corinthians 15 but every man in his own
[1:03:51] order Christ the first fruits after
[1:03:54] afterward afterward so there's an
[1:03:56] afterward of Christ afterward they that
[1:03:59] are christs at his coming are you Christ
[1:04:03] are you looking for his coming then
[1:04:06] you're read here in the scriptures your
[1:04:08] life is hid in Christ is hidden God
[1:04:11] through Christ friends there's not
[1:04:13] enough devils in hell to change that and
[1:04:15] even you can't change
[1:04:18] that so we can see that First
[1:04:21] Corinthians
[1:04:22] 15 how he is uh is uh speaking of the
[1:04:26] new heavens and the new Earth brother
[1:04:28] Jason was uh teaching on it so
[1:04:30] eloquently this morning and we find that
[1:04:33] in the new heavens and the new Earth and
[1:04:35] and and this is going to be the the
[1:04:38] finishing uh of God you know operating
[1:04:42] in a in a in the limitations of a of an
[1:04:45] office you know he was he was in the
[1:04:47] fatherhood above us and while he was in
[1:04:50] the father he say God limited only in
[1:04:52] this sense don't don't throw something
[1:04:54] at me to hear me out when he's in the
[1:04:56] fatherhood he can't do the work that
[1:04:58] he's going to do in flesh as a
[1:05:00] son in the fatherhood he can't do that
[1:05:03] you right see and that's why even David
[1:05:06] couldn't build the house because David
[1:05:10] had been a bloody man and David couldn't
[1:05:12] build it and we didn't know why in Kings
[1:05:14] cuz cuz uh the uh Samuel didn't tell us
[1:05:18] why David wasn't allowed to build it but
[1:05:20] and when Ezra pens the Chronicles he
[1:05:23] tells us
[1:05:24] that God said you can't do it David
[1:05:26] because you've been a bloody man you've
[1:05:28] killed a lot of people your sword is
[1:05:30] dripping with blood see and but your but
[1:05:32] I'll raise up your son and he it is and
[1:05:35] I'll call his name peace amen Solomon
[1:05:38] meaning peace because Solomon is a is a
[1:05:41] type of Christ see because he's the son
[1:05:44] of David that's what Jesus was he was
[1:05:46] the son of David but in the fatherhood
[1:05:49] David desired fellowship with God but in
[1:05:52] the father because God God desired
[1:05:54] fellowship with you David said I live in
[1:05:58] a house of Cedar and he lives in a tent
[1:06:00] and he was it was God moving through the
[1:06:03] heart of David expressing God wanted to
[1:06:06] have it back that Fellowship that he had
[1:06:09] lost with his family in the Garden of
[1:06:11] Eden and God wanted it back I'm here to
[1:06:13] tell you I know you were born in sin but
[1:06:16] God wanted you back Hallelujah and I
[1:06:19] know what the devil has done to many of
[1:06:20] our lives but I'm here to tell you God
[1:06:23] wants you back
[1:06:25] and the devil is not going to be able to
[1:06:27] hold you he's not going to be able to
[1:06:29] hold your children he wants you back he
[1:06:31] wants them back he wants his entire
[1:06:34] family back and he's going to have
[1:06:39] it see he say well that that's going to
[1:06:41] be bad news if the devil gets in the way
[1:06:43] well it's bad news if you get in the
[1:06:46] way cuz he loves you too much to let you
[1:06:49] get in the
[1:06:50] way and getting you out of the way can
[1:06:53] be painful yes hear me teenagers getting
[1:06:56] you out of the way can be painful to
[1:06:59] you but he will do whatever is painfully
[1:07:04] necessary he will not be
[1:07:08] defeated so so but David couldn't do it
[1:07:11] because he had been a a a man of
[1:07:14] judgment a man of of death and and had
[1:07:17] spilled much blood well that's God was
[1:07:18] speaking of himself just like you
[1:07:20] remember when he said to he says to
[1:07:23] Moses I can't I can't Moses I can't go
[1:07:25] down and and dwell in the midst of these
[1:07:27] stiff necked rebellious people I'll kill
[1:07:29] everybody and he said I can't do that I
[1:07:32] can't go with you into the midst of the
[1:07:34] people Lord what will you do I will send
[1:07:36] forth my angel and he will go with you
[1:07:39] see because now that's the angel of the
[1:07:41] Lord's presence that's the angel of the
[1:07:43] Covenant and that's Christ and that's a
[1:07:46] Ministry of atonement so now he can go
[1:07:48] in the midst of the people and dwell at
[1:07:50] the Tabernacle now if they if they if
[1:07:54] they try to misuse his word even he will
[1:07:56] slaughter them even though he's full of
[1:07:59] mercy and holds Mercy yet he will not
[1:08:01] pardon transgressions in other words he
[1:08:04] might forgive you but he's not going to
[1:08:06] let you get by with it remember he said
[1:08:09] to David he said as far as your sin with
[1:08:11] ba Sheba and what you did against Uriah
[1:08:15] uh as far as that sin God hath put it
[1:08:17] away however the sword will never leave
[1:08:19] your house and it didn't and David
[1:08:20] suffered under that so you understand
[1:08:23] that it had it couldn't David couldn't
[1:08:25] build it because David had been that
[1:08:28] David had been a man of war God had been
[1:08:30] a man of war god David had killed a lot
[1:08:33] of people God had killed a lot of people
[1:08:35] and so God wanting to be in the position
[1:08:39] of Fellowship he couldn't do that
[1:08:41] because the the Lamb of God hadn't even
[1:08:43] been offered and he would have to
[1:08:44] destroy his own family so he says David
[1:08:47] you're like me you're the father you
[1:08:49] can't do it but like me I'll raise up
[1:08:52] your son and I'll call call his name
[1:08:54] peace and he shall build the house of
[1:08:57] the Lord and Solomon did built the
[1:09:01] Tabernacle of the Lord's dwelling
[1:09:05] place so so we realize then that he his
[1:09:10] coming as as Paul speaks of in First
[1:09:15] Corinthians about the coming of the Lord
[1:09:17] and the surrendering up of the kingdom
[1:09:19] and how that God is no longer going to
[1:09:21] be operating and the limitation of
[1:09:24] office the Bible in in revelation 22
[1:09:27] says for the first and only time God
[1:09:31] himself shall dwell among his people see
[1:09:36] so the kingdom is surrendered the son
[1:09:38] can surrenders to the father that God
[1:09:40] may be all in all I'm not teaching on
[1:09:41] that today uh keep getting pulled into
[1:09:43] it amen probably because Jason had my
[1:09:46] appetite so wetted with with his Sunday
[1:09:49] school lesson this morning but but we
[1:09:51] realize that here here here's the point
[1:09:55] his coming which we all long for his
[1:10:00] coming brings things finally
[1:10:04] finally at last back to
[1:10:08] Eternity at last after it's all said and
[1:10:11] done we come back to Eternity at last
[1:10:15] friend you'll finally be able to rest
[1:10:18] and lean in on the bosom of Jehovah
[1:10:20] you'll have all will be peace forever
[1:10:23] more
[1:10:24] on that happy Golden Shore everything
[1:10:27] you've ever lost every sorrow you've
[1:10:29] ever had the Lord will see it restored
[1:10:32] there because this will be fulfilling
[1:10:35] him as a redeemer vers 1 Corinthians 15
[1:10:38] sees him fulfilled as a redeemer and a
[1:10:42] savior of course along with the other
[1:10:44] seven compound Redemptive names that he
[1:10:47] moved under Jehovah Nissi and rifa and
[1:10:50] Rea and Shalom and situ and and all of
[1:10:54] these various names he's he's Raa he's
[1:10:56] your healer he's your buckler he's your
[1:10:58] captain he's your provider he's all of
[1:11:00] these things he's present with you and
[1:11:03] so so then we see that this is all
[1:11:06] fulfilled so then then you come to
[1:11:11] Solomon from First Kings
[1:11:15] 10:27 uh where we read in our text you
[1:11:18] you can put it back up again if you like
[1:11:20] brother Mark First Kings 10:27 we read
[1:11:22] this in our in our text and the King
[1:11:25] made silver this is Solomon to be in
[1:11:28] Jerusalem as stones and Cedars made he
[1:11:30] to be as the sycamore trees that are in
[1:11:32] the veil for
[1:11:36] abundance realize something that that
[1:11:40] you remember when brother um Ronnie was
[1:11:43] preaching here Wednesday about rooting
[1:11:47] rooting in the ground like r o o t
[1:11:49] rooting not rah rah rah rooting but God
[1:11:53] Roots around in our lives rooting for
[1:11:55] the Rapture he does that to get you
[1:11:58] ready because he doesn't save you
[1:12:01] without at an altar and say okay you're
[1:12:04] saved see you in heaven that's not how
[1:12:07] it works he he loves you far too much to
[1:12:10] leave you like he found you and so the
[1:12:12] word of God confronts you and it Roots
[1:12:15] around in your life and it gets up in
[1:12:17] your business and it and it directs your
[1:12:19] life and tells you what you should and
[1:12:21] shouldn't do and the majority of human
[1:12:23] don't like that don't want that and
[1:12:25] won't have that remember they wrote a
[1:12:28] letter back and said we will they sent a
[1:12:30] letter after their Master saying we will
[1:12:33] not have this man to rule over us and he
[1:12:36] come back and said fine then he
[1:12:38] annihilated them that's why when the
[1:12:40] when the king sent out an invitation to
[1:12:42] a supper they made this excuse oh I
[1:12:45] bought a yoke of ox and I can't come
[1:12:47] pray have me excused I bought piece of
[1:12:49] land I go to prove it I've got too much
[1:12:51] business going on I've married a wife
[1:12:53] I've got I'm in school I got this I got
[1:12:56] a career I got I got to worry about this
[1:12:58] pray uh please have me excused from the
[1:13:01] Lord's supper and and and the table
[1:13:03] wasn't filled and he said go into the
[1:13:05] hedges and the highways and compel them
[1:13:08] to come for I say to you that not any of
[1:13:11] those people who are invited shall ever
[1:13:14] taste of my
[1:13:16] supper they had their day of visitation
[1:13:19] and they were too busy hear me they were
[1:13:22] too busy with life and
[1:13:26] stuff to respond to the invitation of
[1:13:30] the Lord wow to come to the
[1:13:33] feast so we realize then that that First
[1:13:37] Corinthians 15 he finally brings things
[1:13:41] back to Eternity again the the
[1:13:44] usefulness of that little hickey of time
[1:13:48] remember brother Bram drew the circle
[1:13:50] and down at the bottom he had a little
[1:13:52] like a little drop po down a little Loop
[1:13:54] down and it looped down into time and
[1:13:57] then come back up into the Ring of
[1:13:59] Eternity and brother brandham says my
[1:14:00] wife mea she looked at it and said it
[1:14:03] looks like a a little hickeys on it you
[1:14:06] know like almost like a a skin tag on a
[1:14:09] perfectly on a perfect circle of
[1:14:11] Eternity and brother bradam said that's
[1:14:13] that little Loop down of time for him to
[1:14:15] come and redeem his family I want to
[1:14:18] tell you something friends the the the
[1:14:21] history of mankind on the Earth has been
[1:14:24] has been just a blink it's I mean God
[1:14:27] spent eons and and perhaps brother R
[1:14:30] said millions and billions and trillions
[1:14:32] of years just creating the universe see
[1:14:35] so he he didn't argue with science
[1:14:37] science says oh the universe is far
[1:14:39] older uh the Earth is far older than
[1:14:41] 6,000 years old and brother B says sure
[1:14:43] fine Oh you mean you're a preacher and
[1:14:45] you believe that well the Bible doesn't
[1:14:47] tell us how how long he took to build
[1:14:49] the heavens and the Earth it just tells
[1:14:51] us that he did in the beginning he
[1:14:53] created the heavens and the Earth and
[1:14:54] there's a period there that's it he
[1:14:56] doesn't explain now he took so much time
[1:14:59] building it and turning it and and
[1:15:01] gardening it and creating a garden
[1:15:02] putting man on it and then he fell and
[1:15:04] then the Plan of Redemption and then
[1:15:06] Jesus comes and then the New Testament
[1:15:08] Church and the Holy Ghost and then the
[1:15:09] bride is wound up then the tribulation
[1:15:11] and then the Millennium comes and then
[1:15:12] at the end of that the Earth is purged
[1:15:14] back the whole thing goes back to
[1:15:17] Eternity see and so and and I and I just
[1:15:21] took probably less than 20 seconds in
[1:15:23] explained 6,000 years to you right
[1:15:26] that's all it took cuz you're well
[1:15:28] taught you understand and so in the new
[1:15:31] heavens and the new Earth then that
[1:15:32] little hickey of time is over it's not
[1:15:34] over in the Millennium we're still in
[1:15:35] time there because the Earth hasn't had
[1:15:38] its baptism of fire yet so this fulfills
[1:15:41] him as a redeemer as a savior as I said
[1:15:45] and so when when Solomon is going to
[1:15:47] build his T his his
[1:15:50] Tabernacle and David has a symbol the
[1:15:53] parts because that's what God did he
[1:15:55] assembled all the parts see and but
[1:15:58] Solomon the son of David is the one
[1:16:00] who's actually going to construct it and
[1:16:03] we we find that
[1:16:05] he he he writes to uh the king of Ty to
[1:16:10] hire him and he says now just as you
[1:16:14] were Pals with my dad and you you you
[1:16:19] guys were tight and you know what he
[1:16:21] wanted you wanted y'all worked really
[1:16:23] good together my dad has asked me to has
[1:16:26] left it to me to build a a tabernacle
[1:16:28] unto God but I I I I don't really have
[1:16:31] everything I need so I need you to be
[1:16:34] kind to me like you were to my dad David
[1:16:37] and send me forth and one of the things
[1:16:39] that asked for and I years ago I
[1:16:42] preached a sermon send me therefore a
[1:16:44] man because it had to be a man skilled
[1:16:47] see because the Tabernacle in the
[1:16:49] wilderness is a type of you because you
[1:16:52] are are the dwelling place in the
[1:16:54] Millennium you're the dwelling place of
[1:16:56] the presence of God Amen and so so we
[1:17:00] find and then in the new heavens and the
[1:17:01] new Earth God himself shall dwell he
[1:17:03] can't dwell on the earth in the
[1:17:04] Millennium because it hasn't been purged
[1:17:06] yet you understand the devil's still
[1:17:09] alive and so his Dwelling Place in the
[1:17:11] Millennium is in you and Jesus is there
[1:17:14] with you oh friends what a day that's
[1:17:16] going to
[1:17:18] be so we find that and I'm trying to
[1:17:22] keep all of this so I don't confuse you
[1:17:25] so we find that that this
[1:17:29] Tabernacle you know there there there's
[1:17:31] just there's just all these parts and
[1:17:34] you know I got all these things that God
[1:17:36] put in my life but how do I put them
[1:17:39] together and I got this problem and I
[1:17:41] got that problem and how do I this
[1:17:43] Tabernacle has got to be great I I I
[1:17:46] need to I need to build a tabernacle
[1:17:49] that God can dwell in but my problem is
[1:17:52] I was born in in sin my problem is I had
[1:17:55] this problem and that problem and this
[1:17:56] problem and that problem I got this
[1:17:58] complex and that complex I'm a wreck I'm
[1:18:00] a Mess send me therefore a man somebody
[1:18:05] who can come down somebody who knows me
[1:18:09] somebody who understands all of my
[1:18:12] weaknesses somebody who can put it all
[1:18:14] back together again somebody who can
[1:18:17] build me a man cunning who can build my
[1:18:21] life to be a Dwelling Place
[1:18:26] of the Lord
[1:18:28] God and he said and and the king hyam is
[1:18:31] a gentile so you can see the types there
[1:18:34] I don't want to get preaching that
[1:18:35] sermon but the but the one thing that he
[1:18:38] asked hyam for was some trees and the
[1:18:42] first on the list the primary tree that
[1:18:45] he needed was Cedars of Lebanon amen see
[1:18:48] and so so now when you now when you come
[1:18:51] to First Kings 10 this is the time when
[1:18:54] the Queen of Sheba has come and she
[1:18:57] didn't believe the report she confessed
[1:18:59] it openly of course she how what she
[1:19:01] going to do you couldn't deny it in
[1:19:02] Solomon because he could read he he knew
[1:19:04] the thoughts of your heart and she said
[1:19:07] when I heard the report I didn't believe
[1:19:08] it she said but now mine eyes have seen
[1:19:11] it and she brought him all kinds of
[1:19:13] treasures and silver and gold and
[1:19:16] abundance and spices the Bible says
[1:19:18] never been spices like that in Israel
[1:19:20] from before then or since and and and
[1:19:24] friends that's you you understand that's
[1:19:26] you bringing your life to Christ
[1:19:29] Hallelujah you're and what and then what
[1:19:31] did Solomon do Solomon turned around and
[1:19:34] he he made Shields and he made cups and
[1:19:37] he made he improved the palace and he
[1:19:39] took Cedars and he improved the temple
[1:19:41] and he he outfitted everybody Solomon
[1:19:44] Solomon used the gifts of Sheba to build
[1:19:48] up the kingdom it's not like a a fallen
[1:19:51] man in this day
[1:19:53] where he gets all kinds of power but he
[1:19:55] has no character and he becomes a despot
[1:19:58] and he becomes a tyrant I'm here to tell
[1:20:00] you that if you dedicate your life to
[1:20:02] Christ and bring him your offering he
[1:20:05] won't betray you he's going to build a
[1:20:08] glorious Kingdom full of his people he
[1:20:12] won't waste it he won't he won't be
[1:20:14] underhanded he won't be sneaky he's
[1:20:17] going to build a beautiful world and
[1:20:19] you're going to be a part of
[1:20:21] itall oh I wanted to preach on that
[1:20:23] today so
[1:20:25] bad but he but but but we find that that
[1:20:29] the analogy here is is that he
[1:20:35] takes he that that that during Solomon
[1:20:38] the blessing of Solomon on
[1:20:41] Israel that literally all the stones are
[1:20:45] replaced with
[1:20:47] silver and all of the sycamore trees
[1:20:51] which are so so abundant see when you
[1:20:55] were born in sin you had sin so
[1:20:59] abundant you had so many abundant
[1:21:02] remember brother Ronnie said that
[1:21:03] sycamore tree was so bitter there's so
[1:21:05] much bitterness there's so much
[1:21:08] disappointment there's so much wreckage
[1:21:10] there's so much say my goodness why did
[1:21:12] I have to be built like this I've got
[1:21:14] every weakness what why did God it
[1:21:16] looked like he poured the whole weakness
[1:21:18] tub on me and everybody else seems to
[1:21:20] get Scot free that's not true I promise
[1:21:23] you we all got
[1:21:26] them come on let let the man beside you
[1:21:28] see we all got
[1:21:30] them we came into the land this way but
[1:21:33] the but the blessing of Solomon is he's
[1:21:36] he's now taking out those sycamores
[1:21:39] taking out that bitterness taking out
[1:21:41] those faults taking out those stones
[1:21:43] taking out those worthless things and
[1:21:45] he's building you off silver and he's
[1:21:47] building you of Cedar Hallelujah and
[1:21:50] Cedar was the main product that he used
[1:21:53] to build the Tabernacle
[1:21:55] with because wood represents Humanity
[1:21:59] that's why the Ark of the Covenant was
[1:22:00] made of wood overlaid with gold because
[1:22:02] gold represents
[1:22:04] deity and you are Humanity overlaid with
[1:22:07] deity
[1:22:09] [Applause]
[1:22:11] Hallelujah you with
[1:22:14] me wow that clock is my
[1:22:16] enemy I hardly feel like I've got
[1:22:20] started bear with me for another 20
[1:22:23] minutes will
[1:22:27] you so this
[1:22:29] is I don't want you to forget that amen
[1:22:33] this is what the son of David is doing
[1:22:38] in your
[1:22:39] life he's rooting out the things of no
[1:22:43] value and he's seeking to build you up
[1:22:47] with the things of value you get that so
[1:22:51] I'm sorry that you had to go through a
[1:22:54] heartache but it's for your good I'm
[1:22:57] sorry you suffered that disappointment
[1:22:59] but he knows what he's
[1:23:01] doing oh Just Surrender yourself to this
[1:23:05] master builder Just Surrender your whole
[1:23:08] life I doesn't matter say Lord just take
[1:23:10] my whole life my houses my land my
[1:23:12] dreams my plans I'm placing my whole
[1:23:17] life in your
[1:23:20] hands see
[1:23:24] so we come back then
[1:23:25] to this discussion again about what is
[1:23:28] irony and the whole discussion came
[1:23:31] up because Uriah was pointing out to us
[1:23:34] that irony is often misused and not used
[1:23:36] in its correct connotation it's a very
[1:23:39] common mistake to make it's because
[1:23:41] people don't understand the various
[1:23:43] types of Irony or really what it means
[1:23:45] but again it refers to a situation this
[1:23:48] is situational
[1:23:49] irony it refers to a situation or a
[1:23:53] statement that is opposite or different
[1:23:55] from what is expected or intended see
[1:23:59] and
[1:23:59] so I I I I there there's a lot of people
[1:24:04] who are going to have broken
[1:24:06] expectations and have their
[1:24:09] intentions torn
[1:24:11] down you say wow this is going to be sad
[1:24:14] no it's the most glorious thing because
[1:24:18] your
[1:24:19] expectations uh of you thinking of
[1:24:22] yourself as a failure is not going to
[1:24:24] stand he's going to make you an
[1:24:27] overcomer and I can promise you that the
[1:24:29] devil had all these plans and intentions
[1:24:31] for you it ain't happening there's
[1:24:34] somebody overruling the whole package
[1:24:37] there's somebody saying uh-uh that's not
[1:24:40] my child oh Satan you can do with your
[1:24:43] own whatever you wish but this is
[1:24:46] mine and you're gonna I'm gonna keep you
[1:24:48] on a leash and I'm gonna let you do just
[1:24:50] enough to keep them in line but at the
[1:24:53] end of it I'm going to bring them home
[1:24:55] and I'm going to destroy you and and
[1:24:57] we're going to get on with eternity
[1:25:01] again so so
[1:25:05] ironically I'm going in the
[1:25:08] Rapture so why is it ironic because the
[1:25:10] devil doesn't think I will it's not what
[1:25:13] he expects and a lot of times it's not
[1:25:16] what I expect but I'm
[1:25:19] going Hallelujah just like when Joseph
[1:25:23] come to his brothers and they and Jose
[1:25:25] and they had did such terrible things
[1:25:27] and they had did them for real that
[1:25:28] wasn't metaphorically bad things they
[1:25:31] really did them for real and Joseph
[1:25:34] actually Discerning their heart said you
[1:25:36] actually meant it for evil yep yep no
[1:25:41] joke you actually meant it for evil
[1:25:46] however there was a power over the top
[1:25:48] of it all who meant it for good and
[1:25:51] allowed it to happen
[1:25:53] oh friends I we could almost go home
[1:25:55] right now just
[1:25:56] rejoicing God is the overseer of your
[1:25:59] life Hallelujah you believe that do you
[1:26:02] accept his majesty do you accept his
[1:26:05] majesty the king to be the Sovereign of
[1:26:08] your
[1:26:11] life see so so they thought there in our
[1:26:14] text they thought all the mountains
[1:26:16] would go down and uh the Low Places
[1:26:19] would be brought up and every low place
[1:26:21] would be lifted up and all of this would
[1:26:23] happen brother brandham says in my new
[1:26:25] ministry in
[1:26:28] 1959 he says how many times we look at
[1:26:31] men who climb up in great ranks like and
[1:26:35] and get high names I was telling you
[1:26:36] earlier without reading the quote that's
[1:26:38] why I got away from it because I didn't
[1:26:39] have it in front of me where brother Ram
[1:26:41] said people wants power they don't
[1:26:42] understand what it is he said it's
[1:26:43] really conquering yourself he said see
[1:26:47] when you can learn the Way Up Is Down
[1:26:50] and the the way to success is
[1:26:52] humility and letting God lead your life
[1:26:55] he says then you've got more power than
[1:26:59] the man that runs all over the building
[1:27:01] and makes a big lot of noise he said
[1:27:03] because you've learned to conquer
[1:27:08] yourself so he says how many times we
[1:27:10] look at men who climb up in great ranks
[1:27:13] like and get high
[1:27:17] names but sometimes that's not what God
[1:27:21] calls High
[1:27:23] see now you remember Luke 3 and5 they
[1:27:27] thought it would be this they thought it
[1:27:28] would be that but it was going to be a
[1:27:30] big dose of
[1:27:32] irony wasn't going to be what they it
[1:27:34] was going to happen but not like they
[1:27:35] expected what they intended for it to be
[1:27:38] remember brother brandom said they
[1:27:39] intended to have a general to come in
[1:27:42] there and wipe out the Romans yeah and
[1:27:45] said and God humiliated he said what he
[1:27:47] said he God sent them what they actually
[1:27:48] needed he sent him a baby see so he says
[1:27:52] sometimes what men call high but that's
[1:27:54] not what God calls high do you remember
[1:27:57] when John came preaching the Bible
[1:28:00] foretold that every Mountain would be
[1:28:02] brought low and every low place would be
[1:28:04] lifted up see and when it
[1:28:07] come
[1:28:09] ironically that's me ironically I'm
[1:28:12] adding that you back to the quote and
[1:28:14] when it come you would think it would be
[1:28:18] coming out of heaven with fiery chariots
[1:28:21] goodness gracious
[1:28:22] the mountains are going to be made low
[1:28:24] and the Low Places made High and the
[1:28:26] Crooked places all fixed and
[1:28:28] straightened in a moment and the whole
[1:28:31] world's going to know
[1:28:33] God yeah you would think that brother
[1:28:36] Brenham says you would think that it
[1:28:38] would be coming out of heaven with fiery
[1:28:40] chariots but what was it a poor man
[1:28:44] dressed in a piece of sheep skin wrapped
[1:28:46] around him you talking about irony and
[1:28:49] out on the banks of the Jordan preach
[1:28:52] ing on the Muddy Banks not even in a
[1:28:56] church amen
[1:29:01] right so I'm preaching to you today part
[1:29:05] three of the start of fire and my
[1:29:06] subtopic as I keep saying is starting
[1:29:09] and finishing with
[1:29:11] fire brother brandham says in in
[1:29:15] concerning the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:29:16] remember we read it in our text he said
[1:29:18] you he shall come his fan is in his hand
[1:29:21] and he shall thoroughly and he will
[1:29:22] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[1:29:25] fire amen all right you got that
[1:29:29] image resurrection of Lazarus
[1:29:33] 1951 and I can hear him look around and
[1:29:36] say there was nothing nowhere just
[1:29:40] vastness of space this is God this is
[1:29:42] John 1 and one in the beginning was the
[1:29:44] word and I can hear him look around and
[1:29:47] say there was nothing nowhere just
[1:29:49] vastness of space the father covered all
[1:29:53] that space and then this God
[1:29:58] become
[1:30:00] bized
[1:30:02] bized Microsoft Word hates that word and
[1:30:06] it keeps trying to make me change it but
[1:30:08] this version of the word loved it so I'm
[1:30:11] going to read from this word but just
[1:30:13] remember we're leaning on this
[1:30:15] word and then this God become bized down
[1:30:20] to the logos
[1:30:22] I can hear him say let there be light
[1:30:26] and an adom bursted
[1:30:30] Yonder see and the Sun come into
[1:30:35] existence
[1:30:38] deity all right I just want to say
[1:30:41] you're all already
[1:30:43] aware that when an adom is bursted and
[1:30:46] by the way Microsoft Word hates that
[1:30:48] word too bursted when an Adam is bursted
[1:30:52] you get a fire that's the temperature of
[1:30:54] the sun and a shock wave that produces a
[1:30:57] rushing Mighty
[1:31:00] Wind
[1:31:01] amen 1953 questions and answers on
[1:31:05] Genesis now in St John 1 he said in the
[1:31:07] beginning was the
[1:31:08] word and the first and the Word was God
[1:31:12] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:31:14] Among Us God now catch this hiil
[1:31:17] language God unfolding himself down to
[1:31:24] God unfolding himself down to a human
[1:31:27] being now when he did that he's not
[1:31:30] diminished just like when he divided
[1:31:32] himself in the upper room he didn't get
[1:31:34] diminished he didn't like lose a part of
[1:31:37] himself all he did was multiply himself
[1:31:39] into his church see so that's why you're
[1:31:42] the Christ is the first of the new
[1:31:44] creation you're the continuation of that
[1:31:46] same creation see so all right so he
[1:31:50] says God un folding himself down to a
[1:31:53] human being now watch what he did and I
[1:31:56] can hear him say let there be light and
[1:32:00] when he did an atom bursted and the sun
[1:32:04] came into existence she Whirled for
[1:32:07] hundreds of millions of years forming
[1:32:10] clinkers and burning and forming like it
[1:32:12] is today still burning still breaking
[1:32:16] atoms if the now watch him attach it to
[1:32:18] the atomic bomb if the atomic bomb would
[1:32:21] never get let loose the atomic chain
[1:32:24] would take this Earth would be like the
[1:32:27] sun Yonder see they science knows that
[1:32:29] that if they explode too many of them in
[1:32:32] the right in the right uh
[1:32:33] synchronization in the right places
[1:32:36] it'll catch the atmospheres on fire and
[1:32:38] and set off a chain reaction and I have
[1:32:40] a feeling armageddon's going to be just
[1:32:42] that see so he says the atomic chain
[1:32:46] would be would take this Earth would be
[1:32:48] like the sun Yonder just bursting and
[1:32:50] blowing if if you could stand over on
[1:32:52] another continent and look off at this
[1:32:54] it would look like another Sun where the
[1:32:57] atoms was burning this Earth if the
[1:32:59] chain would ever get loose and it just
[1:33:01] start turning whirling like that
[1:33:03] millions and millions of miles reach
[1:33:05] these big flames of billions of
[1:33:07] Fahrenheit of heat so he
[1:33:11] began that's why I I I I'm I'm I'm
[1:33:15] taking this subtitle today he began and
[1:33:18] he's finishing with fire because he
[1:33:22] began with fire when an atom
[1:33:25] bursted and then he became in John 1 a
[1:33:29] pillar of fire amen he burned Sodom and
[1:33:35] Gomorrah with fire that science you
[1:33:38] heard brother Matt's uh Exposition on
[1:33:41] that science has recently identified
[1:33:45] that Sodom and gamorra suffered a heat
[1:33:47] event equal to a nuclear
[1:33:50] detonation God dropped a nuke on
[1:33:54] them and they found the pottery glazed
[1:33:57] over from a heat
[1:33:59] event so he begins with fire he bursts
[1:34:03] an Adam he became a pillar of fire he
[1:34:07] burned Sodom and Gomorrah with fire he
[1:34:10] met Moses in a bush on fire when he
[1:34:14] descended on the Mountaintop the whole
[1:34:17] top of the mountain was on fire my God
[1:34:21] himself self is an all consuming fire in
[1:34:25] The Exodus from Egypt Moses commanded
[1:34:28] the children of Israel to slay a lamb
[1:34:30] and put the blood over the door and the
[1:34:33] lamb was to be roasted by fire it could
[1:34:37] not be eaten raw it could not be boiled
[1:34:40] in water they even burned the
[1:34:45] leftovers this of course you know the
[1:34:48] when you look at the whole burnt
[1:34:49] offering it's symbolic it's a symbolic
[1:34:52] Act of Consecration and dedication to
[1:34:54] the Lord You're to be a whole burnt
[1:34:57] offering amen Leviticus 6 uh brother
[1:35:01] Mark Leviticus 61
[1:35:04] 12-13 now these are the priest
[1:35:06] instructions for the for the fire in the
[1:35:09] Tabernacle and the fire Leviticus 6:12
[1:35:12] and the fire upon the
[1:35:14] altar shall be burning in it it shall
[1:35:18] not be put out and the priest shall burn
[1:35:21] wood on it every morning and lay the
[1:35:23] burnt offering in order upon it and he
[1:35:26] shall burn thereon the fat of the peace
[1:35:29] offerings verse 13 the fire shall ever
[1:35:33] be burning upon the altar it shall never
[1:35:38] go
[1:35:39] out Leviticus 16 verse
[1:35:43] 11-14 and Aaron shall bring the bulock
[1:35:46] of the sin offering which is for himself
[1:35:49] and shall make an atonement for himself
[1:35:51] and for his house and shall kill the
[1:35:53] bulock of the sin offering which is for
[1:35:56] himself and he shall take a sensor full
[1:35:59] of the burning coals of fire from off
[1:36:02] the altar before the Lord and his hands
[1:36:05] full of sweet incense beaten small and
[1:36:07] bring it within the veil this is in the
[1:36:10] shikina and he shall put the incense
[1:36:13] upon the fire before the Lord that the
[1:36:16] cloud of the incense May cover The Mercy
[1:36:19] Seat that is upon the testimony that he
[1:36:21] die not and he shall take the blood of
[1:36:24] the bulock and sprinkle it with his
[1:36:26] finger upon The Mercy Seat Eastward and
[1:36:29] before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle
[1:36:31] the blood with his finger seven times
[1:36:33] brother Brandon breaks all that down I'm
[1:36:34] not teaching on it today verse
[1:36:37] 27 verse 27 and the Bullock for the sin
[1:36:41] offering and the Goat for the sin
[1:36:44] offering whose blood was brought in to
[1:36:46] make atonement in the Holy Place shall
[1:36:49] one carry forth without the camp and
[1:36:52] they shall burn in the fire their skins
[1:36:56] and their flesh and their
[1:36:58] dung he started with fire he has
[1:37:03] maintained fire and he's going to finish
[1:37:06] with fire he's restoring you with
[1:37:12] fire It Was Elijah who called down fire
[1:37:16] on Mount Carmel to to consume the
[1:37:19] offering it vaporized the water the
[1:37:22] rocks and even consumed the dust and the
[1:37:25] residue later this same Elijah called
[1:37:28] down that same fire on his enemies
[1:37:31] eliminating them in a moment and then
[1:37:34] when it was all said and done Elijah
[1:37:37] went home in a chariot of
[1:37:42] fire see the three Hebrew children met
[1:37:46] the Fourth Man In The Fire four has been
[1:37:51] the number of Deliverance to this day
[1:37:54] brother brandham teaching in Revelation
[1:37:56] chapter 4 number 3 1961 and four is the
[1:37:59] number of Earth see Deliverance there
[1:38:02] was three Hebrew children in the fire
[1:38:04] furnace but the fourth one come it was
[1:38:06] Deliverance Lazarus was in the grave
[1:38:08] three days but when the fourth one come
[1:38:11] he was delivered Luke 12:35 says let
[1:38:14] your loins be G about and your lights
[1:38:20] burning John
[1:38:22] 5:35 he was a burning and a Shining
[1:38:26] Light and you were willing for a season
[1:38:28] to rejoice in his lights his servants in
[1:38:31] Revelation 4:5 are called burning lamps
[1:38:35] out of the throne proceded Lightnings
[1:38:38] and thunderings and voices and there
[1:38:39] were seven lamps of fire burning Before
[1:38:43] the Throne which are the seven spirits
[1:38:46] of God Revelation 188 therefore shall
[1:38:49] her plagues come in one day death and
[1:38:52] mourning and famine and she shall be
[1:38:55] utterly burned with fire for strong is
[1:38:59] is the Lord God who judgeth her I'm here
[1:39:02] to tell you something friends you are
[1:39:04] baptized into the body of Christ by Holy
[1:39:09] Ghost and Fire he divided himself into
[1:39:14] licks of fire and moved upon the people
[1:39:17] in the upper room he descended and
[1:39:20] revelation 10 and his feet were like
[1:39:23] pillars of fire as if they burned in an
[1:39:27] oven and and and I and and and
[1:39:30] chronologically I skipped Abraham
[1:39:33] because Abraham's fire event I skipped
[1:39:35] it on purpose so I could connect it to
[1:39:38] our new birth because the original plan
[1:39:41] for the upper room to be fire was always
[1:39:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost was always
[1:39:48] going to be fire brother Brandon deals
[1:39:51] with that in the message from that time
[1:39:54] and brother brandham shows that when
[1:39:56] when God made the Covenant with Abraham
[1:39:59] that he took animals and he divided them
[1:40:02] and he took birds and he didn't divide
[1:40:04] the birds because the dove represents
[1:40:06] Divine Healing and it's in the Old
[1:40:08] Testament and the New Testament so it
[1:40:09] wasn't divided but he divided the other
[1:40:11] animals and he stood between them and he
[1:40:13] fell into a deep sleep the Bible says
[1:40:15] brother Brandon breaks all this down in
[1:40:17] that message you go check it out he says
[1:40:19] at the time when the setting of the Sun
[1:40:21] in other words when time shall be no
[1:40:23] more and when Abraham fell into a deep
[1:40:26] sleep he said we all fall into a deep
[1:40:28] sleep who don't go in a Rapture and he
[1:40:30] said and then there was a a a a burning
[1:40:33] furnace a smoking furnace and he said
[1:40:36] representing hell because when you die
[1:40:39] your destination is that burning furnace
[1:40:42] your destination there's nothing you can
[1:40:43] do to avoid it he said but coming down
[1:40:47] against between all of that was a
[1:40:49] burning light it was the the pillar of
[1:40:51] fire and God was confirming the Covenant
[1:40:54] The Upper Room experience was always
[1:40:57] going to be
[1:40:58] fire hallu you're born he whose fan is
[1:41:02] in his hand will thoroughly Purge and he
[1:41:05] will baptize you in the Holy Ghost and
[1:41:09] in fire oh Hallelujah Ezekiel 1113 ask
[1:41:14] for the likeness of the living creatures
[1:41:16] their appearance was like burning coals
[1:41:19] of fire and like the appear of lamps it
[1:41:22] went up and down among the living
[1:41:23] creatures and the fire was bright and
[1:41:26] out of the fire went forth lightning
[1:41:28] Malachi 41 for behold the day cometh
[1:41:32] that shall burn as an oven and all the
[1:41:35] proud yay and all that do wickedly shall
[1:41:37] be stubble and the day that cometh shall
[1:41:40] burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts
[1:41:43] that it leave them neither root nor
[1:41:45] Branch the false prophet death hell the
[1:41:49] grave and all the Godly are cast into
[1:41:52] the Lake of Fire in Revelation 20
[1:41:55] whosoever was not found written in the
[1:41:57] Book of Life was cast into the Lake of
[1:42:00] Fire the Earth at the end of the
[1:42:02] Millennium is cleansed by Holy Fire to
[1:42:06] have a new heavens and a new Earth so
[1:42:09] that God
[1:42:10] himself can come down and live among us
[1:42:14] Isaiah 4 4 to 5 he says when the
[1:42:19] Lord when the Lord shall have washed
[1:42:21] away you can pull this one up brother
[1:42:23] Mark it's a little bit lengthy Isaiah 4
[1:42:27] 4-5 when the Lord shall have washed away
[1:42:30] the filth of the daughters of Zion and
[1:42:33] shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem
[1:42:37] from the midst thereof by the spirit of
[1:42:39] judgment and by the spirit of
[1:42:41] burning and the Lord will create upon
[1:42:44] every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and
[1:42:47] upon her assemblies a cloud and a Smoke
[1:42:51] by day and The Shining of a flaming fire
[1:42:54] by night for upon all the glory shall be
[1:42:59] a defense for upon all the glory shall
[1:43:02] be a defense and what more could I say
[1:43:05] today for time would fail to tell you
[1:43:09] further how that he is a consuming fire
[1:43:12] how that he is the refiner fire how that
[1:43:16] he sends forth Trials of fire and in the
[1:43:19] time of Solomon when he's building the
[1:43:22] Temple down came a fire and filled up
[1:43:25] the
[1:43:26] house so that none they couldn't even
[1:43:29] carry out the duties the priesthood
[1:43:32] couldn't even carry out their
[1:43:35] duties because why the presence of God
[1:43:37] in those mortal bodies Daniel fainted
[1:43:40] and passed out brother Brandon passed
[1:43:43] out just looking at him in the eyes over
[1:43:45] in a field he told Brother bisc every
[1:43:48] time that Pillar of Fire comes it's just
[1:43:50] like I could die Isaiah in Isaiah 6 he
[1:43:54] felt so exposed he felt undone he felt
[1:43:58] helpless in the presence of he who was
[1:44:01] lifted High whose train filled the
[1:44:03] temple whose voice shook the post oh my
[1:44:07] I'm undone a woe is me Isaiah said I'm
[1:44:10] undone I'm a man of unclean lips I dwell
[1:44:13] among a people of unclean lips and God
[1:44:16] sent forth a coal of fire from the altar
[1:44:20] of fire in the hand of an Angel and it
[1:44:24] touched his lips and said now thy sin is
[1:44:27] purged and thine iniquity is taken away
[1:44:30] and then the voice of God said who shall
[1:44:32] go for us and Isaiah jumped to his feet
[1:44:35] send me send
[1:44:37] me I'm here to tell you we had no chance
[1:44:41] you were lost and undone but God sent an
[1:44:44] angel a messenger in this day and he had
[1:44:47] a burning he was a burning light and he
[1:44:50] had a whole and it touched your lips and
[1:44:52] you have fed on this word and what has
[1:44:54] it done it has taken away your sin it is
[1:44:58] purg you of your
[1:45:01] iniquity because when he purges Zion
[1:45:04] that's the bride the glory of the Lord
[1:45:07] shall be
[1:45:09] seen is that your desire today friends
[1:45:12] to say I want my life to be a a Burning
[1:45:16] Flame of the glory of the Lord
[1:45:21] Hallelujah friends that's what he's come
[1:45:24] to
[1:45:25] do that's what's happened in our lives
[1:45:29] Hallelujah see
[1:45:31] now that'd be a perfect place to close
[1:45:35] but you've heard me say I always check
[1:45:37] with the Lord and I'm forbidden to close
[1:45:39] yet
[1:45:40] okay you trust me in that you know I've
[1:45:43] been doing that for years Lord can I
[1:45:45] close yes and I'll even tell you I got
[1:45:48] permission I don't have it right now now
[1:45:55] amen a coal of fire I need you for seven
[1:46:00] eight 10 more minutes you got
[1:46:04] me a coal of
[1:46:06] fire came forth from the
[1:46:11] altar carried by an
[1:46:13] Angel who stood Before the Throne we
[1:46:16] read about
[1:46:17] him those those living creatures those
[1:46:19] cherubs
[1:46:20] they stood before they stood in his
[1:46:22] presence see they they they guarded the
[1:46:26] way in the tree of in the from the for
[1:46:29] the Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden
[1:46:31] and they ran Adam and Eve out and
[1:46:32] brother R says now those same ones are
[1:46:34] running you back
[1:46:37] see so this coal of fire it come it
[1:46:40] touched his lips it purged him of his
[1:46:43] sin and he you know it doesn't even
[1:46:47] matter today the world can resist
[1:46:51] Christ all they want it's not going to
[1:46:54] stop his
[1:46:55] plan they can deny his existence or
[1:46:59] admit his existence as a great man but
[1:47:01] denies his deity and I think that's
[1:47:03] probably worse than the first
[1:47:07] one they have all kinds of evil opinions
[1:47:11] about the word of God for this hour and
[1:47:13] about those who follow
[1:47:15] it but I'm here to tell you that this
[1:47:18] fire on that day of judgment
[1:47:21] will consume all
[1:47:24] resistance it will consume all
[1:47:27] resistance at the judgment and every
[1:47:31] knee will bow no matter what you think
[1:47:35] of Christ every knee will bow no matter
[1:47:40] you Rage with unbelief you Rage with
[1:47:43] Defiance I'm here to tell you let the
[1:47:46] Heathen rage on that day it will that
[1:47:49] fire of God that's coming from his
[1:47:52] throne that Isaiah saw that John saw it
[1:47:55] will consume all resistance and every
[1:47:59] knee will bow could I say to you today
[1:48:02] and here comes the burden that the Lord
[1:48:04] only gave me this this morning late as I
[1:48:07] was rushing to get to church he wants to
[1:48:10] burn all of your
[1:48:13] resistance I would say to you today in
[1:48:15] the name of the Lord let
[1:48:17] him let he's rooting for the rapture
[1:48:20] he's rooting I know he's into your
[1:48:22] business I know he's dealing with your
[1:48:24] life I know you don't like it sometimes
[1:48:26] it rubs you the wrong way but I'm here
[1:48:28] to tell you something friends on that
[1:48:30] day he'll consume all resistance why
[1:48:32] wait till then let it happen now while
[1:48:37] there's
[1:48:38] Mercy there won't be any Mercy then then
[1:48:41] you'll admit it but it'll be too
[1:48:46] late if there's one thing that God
[1:48:49] desires to consume in our
[1:48:52] lives like he did for
[1:48:54] Elijah he desires to consume your
[1:48:58] enemies now before you go out picking
[1:49:01] the people you want him to
[1:49:07] consume I first need to advise you that
[1:49:10] we have seen the enemy and it is
[1:49:15] us it's not believe it or not ironically
[1:49:19] it's not your brother or your sister but
[1:49:21] it's me oh Lord standing in the need of
[1:49:25] prayer see so you need to know how this
[1:49:29] works God removes and destroys the enemy
[1:49:33] in your life and when doing so he aligns
[1:49:37] you with his purpose in other words
[1:49:39] friends he doesn't do it just to do it
[1:49:41] he doesn't do anything without a purpose
[1:49:43] and a reason one of the biggest enemies
[1:49:46] God is seeking to devour is sin in your
[1:49:54] life you
[1:49:56] understand he didn't need to devour
[1:49:58] Elijah Elijah was already following him
[1:50:00] so he could go ahead and consume his
[1:50:02] enemies David was already following him
[1:50:05] so he wiped out his enemies but I'm here
[1:50:07] to tell you I'm not need I don't need
[1:50:09] God to go up the street and kill anybody
[1:50:11] on my behalf because I don't I'm my
[1:50:14] failures make me unworthy that anybody
[1:50:16] should suffer on my behalf God forbid
[1:50:18] goodness gracious don't let anybody
[1:50:21] suffer on my account I don't care how
[1:50:22] they treat me I I do not deserve that
[1:50:27] Lord have mercy on
[1:50:28] them and let me have mercy on them but
[1:50:32] his consuming his consuming fire in this
[1:50:35] day the biggest enemy is sin that is
[1:50:39] left ungiven to the Lord and all it and
[1:50:43] all that is therefore is Satan has put
[1:50:45] that in your life to delay to effect to
[1:50:49] try to destroy joy to try to hinder
[1:50:51] every glorious thing that God has
[1:50:54] planned for you in your life sin invades
[1:50:57] your heart it invades your mind it
[1:50:59] wrecks God's plans don't let that happen
[1:51:03] as brother Donnie was preaching brother
[1:51:06] Ronnie was preaching Wednesday night let
[1:51:08] let the mind which was in Christ be in
[1:51:11] you let the word of God dwell in you
[1:51:15] richly I'm here to tell you something
[1:51:17] friends this is the fire that God has
[1:51:20] for you and I in this day this is what
[1:51:23] Solomon was trying to this is what the
[1:51:25] blessing of Solomon and I'm here to tell
[1:51:27] you I've already said it I'm going to
[1:51:28] close by saying it again and double down
[1:51:30] on it I know you've been through trials
[1:51:33] I know you've had heartaches I know
[1:51:34] you've had disappointments but Solomon
[1:51:37] was getting rid of the
[1:51:39] Rocks he was replacing it with silver he
[1:51:42] was getting rid of the bitter sycamor he
[1:51:45] was replacing it with
[1:51:47] cedar I just say Lord Drive about
[1:51:50] everything Prophet said however much
[1:51:52] you'll let go of the world and get it
[1:51:54] out of you God Christ will come in and
[1:51:57] fill up that
[1:51:59] place we're headed for a Rapture friends
[1:52:02] it's time to let the world go it's time
[1:52:05] to let the fire of the Holy Spirit
[1:52:08] consume Our
[1:52:11] Lives consume Our
[1:52:13] Lives you believe that let's stand to
[1:52:17] our feet you see why the Lord won't let
[1:52:19] me stop till I finish with
[1:52:20] that oh Bow your heads with me
[1:52:24] friends and I'm not finished with this
[1:52:26] thought but I'm I'm finished

[1:52:58] today

[1:53:02] word my how it has challenged
[1:53:05] us but it it it should be that way
[1:53:09] shouldn't it
[1:53:10] Lord should never leave us
[1:53:14] comfortable in our
[1:53:16] weakness may we never feel comfor able
[1:53:21] in spiritual
[1:53:22] weakness may you put a Zeal and a
[1:53:25] striving may you rekindle a
[1:53:27] flame it's not about how that
[1:53:31] fire may or may not strike the senses of
[1:53:34] one the the bodily senses of one the
[1:53:37] different from the bodily senses of
[1:53:41] another some people speak in tongues
[1:53:44] some
[1:53:45] don't I never have some people run and
[1:53:49] leap
[1:53:51] I
[1:53:51] don't some people fall on the ground and
[1:53:54] roll around in drunken laughter I've
[1:53:56] seen it I've never done that when the
[1:53:59] Holy Spirit strikes me Lord I jump up
[1:54:01] and down and sometimes I'm so excited I
[1:54:04] jump up and down and spin as I'm jumping
[1:54:06] I can't help it I don't even realize I'm
[1:54:07] doing
[1:54:08] it sometimes in my office Lord I clap my
[1:54:12] hands so
[1:54:13] thunderously my dear wife rushes in to
[1:54:16] see if I'm okay I felt your
[1:54:20] nearness sometimes your nearness comes
[1:54:22] in and I I crumble to the floor and I
[1:54:26] weep and gush with
[1:54:29] tears doesn't matter how
[1:54:32] you how this fire plays upon the senses
[1:54:36] the the bodily senses of a
[1:54:38] human but that it would remove
[1:54:41] sin that it would Purge iniquity and
[1:54:44] Give Us Clean Hands and give us clean
[1:54:47] Hearts oh God that we might be the
[1:54:50] Tabernacle of the Lord's Dwelling
[1:54:53] Place take out all the stones Lord fill
[1:54:56] it with silver take away all these

[1:55:31] Temple this Temple that I stand in today
[1:55:34] so that the works of My Flesh can no
[1:55:36] longer
[1:55:37] work granted Lord let there be such a
[1:55:41] presence of the fire from off the altar
[1:55:44] that none of my bodily senses which are
[1:55:46] still
[1:55:47] unconverted none of my me memory reason
[1:55:50] conscious affection imagination nothing
[1:55:53] I taste touch see hear feel nothing
[1:55:56] nothing can affect Lord or overrule that
[1:56:00] innermost inner
[1:56:02] man that that innermost Inner Man in
[1:56:05] that in that what we sometimes call the
[1:56:09] the holy of holies Lord whereas the
[1:56:13] Bible referred to it as the most holy
[1:56:15] Place same
[1:56:16] thing Lord that's where the shikina is
[1:56:20] that's where I want to live I want to be
[1:56:22] a third realm dweller Lord so I pray
[1:56:26] that you'll grant that to us today
[1:56:28] father let this word that's gone forth
[1:56:30] Lord the Rapture is
[1:56:32] soon the world in a Twist of of ironic
[1:56:36] Fate has

[1:56:39] day you were not what they
[1:56:41] expected you the the the the the
[1:56:44] intention of the of the systems of
[1:56:47] Religion Today are going to see their
[1:56:50] intentions
[1:56:51] frustrated and come to nothing it'll be
[1:56:53] a it'll be cruel
[1:56:56] irony when they stand on that day and
[1:56:59] realized what could have
[1:57:02] been maybe there's young people here
[1:57:04] today maybe there's old people maybe
[1:57:06] there's
[1:57:07] both who would say brother Jason today
[1:57:10] preach your
[1:57:12] man I've come to terms with myself today
[1:57:15] and I feel like Isaiah in the presence
[1:57:17] of God and I need a coal of Fire why
[1:57:19] don't you raise up your hands to the
[1:57:21] Lord and say oh God come in I don't care
[1:57:24] whether you maybe you've already been
[1:57:25] born again of the spirit of God maybe
[1:57:27] you need a refilling maybe you need new
[1:57:29] fire a rekindled Zeal to say Lord God Of
[1:57:32] Heaven sanctify my heart and my mind
[1:57:35] cleanse my thinking change my plans and
