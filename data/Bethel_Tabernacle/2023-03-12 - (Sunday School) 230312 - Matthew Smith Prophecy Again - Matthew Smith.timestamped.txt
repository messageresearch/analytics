[0:00] and uh we don't really have to turn
[0:02] there if you don't want to I got it here
[0:04] and I'm going to be kind of moving
[0:05] through it well actually no go ahead go
[0:07] ahead and put it up on the screen I'm
[0:08] going to go ahead and um
[0:11] and read uh the first 11 verses
[0:16] um
[0:17] and uh Matthew chapter 17 and verse 1
[0:20] I'll just start reading y'all catch up
[0:22] it says after six days
[0:25] Jesus taketh Peter
[0:27] James and John his brother and bringeth
[0:29] them into a high mountain apart
[0:31] verse two and was transfigured before
[0:33] them and his face did shine as the sun
[0:36] and his raiment was white as the light
[0:39] and behold
[0:40] there appeared unto them Moses and Elias
[0:43] talking with talking with him
[0:46] then answered Peter and said unto Jesus
[0:48] Lord it is good for us to be here if
[0:51] thou will let us make here three
[0:53] Tabernacles one for the one for Moses
[0:55] one for Elias
[0:58] while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud
[1:01] overshadowed them and behold a voice out
[1:04] of the cloud
[1:06] which said this is my beloved Son in
[1:09] whom I am well pleased hear ye him
[1:13] um continuing on uh and then the
[1:16] disciples and when the disciples heard
[1:17] it they fell in their face and were sore
[1:20] afraid
[1:22] um
[1:23] see uh
[1:27] um and Jesus came and touched them and
[1:28] said arise and be not afraid and then
[1:31] when they had lifted up their eyes they
[1:33] saw no man save Jesus only
[1:34] and as they came down from the mountain
[1:36] Jesus charged them saying television to
[1:39] no man until the son of man be risen
[1:41] again from the dead
[1:43] and his disciples asked him saying why
[1:47] then say the scribes that Elias must
[1:49] first come and Jesus answered and said
[1:51] of them Elias truly shall first come and
[1:54] restore all things
[1:56] so
[1:58] um I wanted to
[2:00] in this and I'm going to be hopefully if
[2:02] I have the time I want to come back and
[2:03] pick up some of this later and so just
[2:05] one thing to keep in the back your back
[2:06] your minds when I was studying this out
[2:09] I noticed there's seems to be a fair
[2:11] number of parallels if we actually take
[2:13] this these 11 verses and look and
[2:15] compare them to Revelations chapter 10.
[2:17] I mean which I'm going to hope to do
[2:19] that a little bit later on but the one
[2:21] thing I want to catch for now is
[2:25] if you notice you know when when Moses
[2:28] and Elijah appear
[2:30] Peter's first instinct is a trinity
[2:33] Doctrine
[2:34] he's trying to build three Tabernacles
[2:36] and make three gods right and you know
[2:39] because of because of humanity is tends
[2:42] to do that
[2:44] um we tend to see the servants and the
[2:48] the means through that God works through
[2:50] and then try to deify the messenger
[2:52] instead of the message and what ends up
[2:55] happening and it's you know what I'm
[2:58] uh
[3:01] the problem is it's showing that any
[3:03] time you're trying to deify a prophet
[3:07] and say well this individual person is
[3:10] is not actually the message or the
[3:12] messenger this is actually the God and
[3:15] you're trying to worship a prophet it's
[3:16] the same Spirit as a trinity
[3:18] right it's the same thing and it ends up
[3:20] with a lot of the exact same
[3:22] pitfalls and and train wrecks that you
[3:25] get
[3:27] um you know you end up with with you
[3:29] know some sort of
[3:31] centralized control and and you end up
[3:34] with the nicolaitan attitude towards and
[3:36] crushing any sort of individual
[3:38] relationship with God because it's all
[3:40] funneled through some well we're you
[3:42] know the we are the the the the you know
[3:46] we have the prophet you know we have the
[3:48] the we are the central Authority
[3:51] and so
[3:53] um
[3:55] the and so then it you know it comes
[3:57] down it says so but as Peter's saying
[3:59] this while he's still speaking
[4:02] God corrects it right there it says no
[4:03] no
[4:04] not these people but this is my beloved
[4:07] Son hear ye him right the the servants
[4:10] are fine but you've got to keep your
[4:12] eyes on Christ
[4:15] um because you know after the cloud
[4:16] descends and it it you know they saw
[4:19] they saw Jesus only right
[4:21] so
[4:23] um oh man
[4:25] burning through my time quick um so I
[4:27] want to come down from there and and
[4:29] look at this uh
[4:31] in the sermon the masterpiece
[4:35] um I'm gonna I'm gonna probably have to
[4:37] skip a lot of this
[4:39] um
[4:40] so brother Brown This is the first
[4:41] sermon in which brother Branham tells
[4:43] the vision in which he sees the bride in
[4:45] preview right we're all familiar with
[4:47] the sermon he sees all the he sees the
[4:49] bride and then all the different
[4:50] churches come by and then the Church of
[4:51] America is in this horrible State
[4:54] um and and then he sees the bride again
[4:56] and you know she goes up right well
[5:01] um so I want to read some excerpts from
[5:02] that I don't think I have time to read
[5:03] the whole thing
[5:05] so he says um so this is the first time
[5:07] he's ever telling anybody this uh this
[5:09] vision
[5:12] um
[5:13] so he says I fell into a trance and when
[5:16] I did there was somebody with me I
[5:18] didn't see the person I was just it was
[5:21] just a voice
[5:22] and I looked and as I looked this way he
[5:25] said the birds the bride will come in
[5:29] view for preview
[5:31] and I looked coming to me and I seen the
[5:34] prettiest bunch of clean dressed women I
[5:36] ever seen in my life
[5:38] but each one of them looked like was
[5:41] dressed different they all had long hair
[5:43] longer sleeves and skirts and so forth
[5:45] young women they look kind of I'd say
[5:47] about maybe 20.
[5:51] um
[5:52] uh okay and he says um uh skip over this
[5:58] um and he said so then he goes into you
[6:00] know how he's he was an American and he
[6:01] saw the Church of America come by and
[6:02] how she was you know basically dressed
[6:05] with um he what he describes here almost
[6:07] like shredded newspaper and that's it
[6:09] just just
[6:10] vulgar and and lewd and just a complete
[6:14] disgrace and and all the you know all
[6:16] these different churches from around the
[6:18] world coming around
[6:19] and they're all just progressively worse
[6:22] um and uh which is interesting
[6:24] um
[6:26] because he started this he started this
[6:29] um by saying uh
[6:31] how he'd been in in
[6:33] New York Los Angeles
[6:36] um but the filthiest bunch of women I
[6:37] ever seen in my life was in
[6:38] Jeffersonville Indiana
[6:40] that's what he said
[6:42] um
[6:42] he said I'd never seen so much Guam and
[6:44] filth in my life as I've seen amongst
[6:45] them people
[6:47] and so it was him looking at this in his
[6:50] own Hometown feeling so just broken
[6:54] about how how
[6:56] you know sinful the people were in his
[6:58] own Hometown that that's when the lord
[7:00] gave him this vision
[7:01] and so here he is seeing so here he sees
[7:03] the Church of America come by completely
[7:07] um just just
[7:09] immoral and he
[7:11] um and so his heart's broken about this
[7:13] right
[7:14] and it says and I started to bow my head
[7:16] and he said wait the bride must come
[7:19] again and I looked and here they come
[7:21] again
[7:22] and they passed by sweet looking little
[7:25] ladies they was all looking right at me
[7:27] as they passed by
[7:29] I noticed each one was dressed different
[7:31] and one in the back had kind of a long
[7:33] hair hanging down and had it rolled
[7:35] around like this might have been German
[7:37] or something like that
[7:39] and I watched them and then they were
[7:41] starting to leave two or three of them
[7:42] in the back started to get out of step
[7:44] and I was just going to holler at them
[7:46] and they was trying to get back in Step
[7:48] again
[7:49] and I've seen them just
[7:52] um and the Visions Fade Out and changed
[7:54] for me
[7:57] so
[7:59] um so we have this this image of you
[8:02] know if you could imagine in your mind
[8:03] so the Bride Comes then all these
[8:05] progressively deteriorating churches and
[8:08] then the Bride Comes again
[8:10] and he says
[8:12] um
[8:12] and in the in the in the beginning
[8:15] paragraphs of this he's talking about
[8:16] how he never told anyone this and he
[8:17] wasn't even sure exactly what it what
[8:19] the interpretation of this Vision was
[8:21] and so then he comes down here and says
[8:22] now here's the interpretation thereof
[8:25] uh now remember I had just got through
[8:28] writing I hadn't finished I hadn't wrote
[8:30] these notes yet but in preaching this
[8:32] morning I came I caught what it was
[8:34] right in my sermon did you notice the
[8:36] church only came in view
[8:39] um uh it's true friends the heavenly
[8:41] father who writes the word
[8:43] um skip this uh did you notice the Bride
[8:46] come in view twice right so all the
[8:49] churches come and view once the Bride
[8:50] Comes in view twice
[8:52] the first seed and the second seed both
[8:54] of them exactly the same one
[8:56] and the reason they were dressed in
[8:58] different parts shall come from All
[9:01] Nations
[9:02] it'll make up the bride each one had
[9:05] long hair and no makeup and real pretty
[9:07] girls and they were watching me that
[9:10] represented the bride coming out of all
[9:13] the nations see each one represented a
[9:15] nation as they marched perfectly in line
[9:17] with the word
[9:20] um and then I have to watch her she'll
[9:24] get out of step with that word if I
[9:25] don't watch when she's passing by if she
[9:28] gets by maybe it'll be in my time
[9:32] when I'm over see when I'm finished or
[9:35] whatever it is watch
[9:37] they was getting back trying their best
[9:40] they was getting back they was getting
[9:42] in line because they was looking out
[9:44] somewhere else watching about that
[9:47] church that just went out into chaos
[9:50] um the front one's never the back ones
[9:52] just two or three of them was kind of
[9:54] stepped out a little bit to the right
[9:56] hand side and looked like was trying to
[9:58] get back in line as they went by
[10:01] they was just passing me oh far as the
[10:03] wall passed me and I was standing there
[10:06] um and then uh okay notice the church
[10:08] only came in view once each Nation the
[10:10] church but the Bride come in twice
[10:12] that's what it was now not knowing it
[10:15] um this morning okay so I want to kind
[10:18] of paint this little bit of a mental
[10:20] picture a little bit
[10:22] because I think this
[10:24] this Vision within this is some really
[10:27] good balanced teaching because
[10:30] so imagine
[10:31] he says when the bride's passing by
[10:34] she's looking at him the whole time
[10:36] she's passing by okay
[10:38] so she's walking by and she's you know
[10:40] walking by like this and y'all are the
[10:41] bride or brother Brandon you're just
[10:43] going like this right
[10:44] okay
[10:46] well once you get past him
[10:48] she has to move past the prophet she has
[10:50] to to go where she's going because he's
[10:52] you know just watching her she goes by
[10:54] if she goes back you know once she goes
[10:57] past him she can't keep keep looking or
[10:59] she's going to walk in a circle right
[11:02] she has to go and take she the prophet
[11:04] has to leave the scene or she'll get
[11:06] hung up on that right she'll never move
[11:08] past him
[11:11] and so
[11:13] on the one hand she has to move past but
[11:17] notice as soon as she does she ends up
[11:19] out of Step
[11:20] so now we have a problem right
[11:23] we have a problem in which
[11:25] you
[11:26] and we see this in the message today
[11:28] people don't want to move past the
[11:29] profit they've got their eyes on the
[11:31] prophet
[11:32] right and they end up walking in a
[11:34] circle
[11:35] or you have the people who are
[11:37] completely turned away from the prophet
[11:38] end up chasing a denomination
[11:40] right but notice the thing that kept her
[11:43] in line even when she didn't have her
[11:45] eyes on him was his voice that continued
[11:47] on right he called after her and his
[11:49] voice continued after him and that kept
[11:51] her in line This is
[11:54] and so this is
[11:56] um
[11:57] so it creates a balance right you
[12:00] uh see here
[12:04] and so then
[12:05] um picking up where it was uh talking
[12:07] about the bride again in the in the same
[12:09] quote says
[12:11] um all others never appeared no more
[12:15] they went out never to come back again
[12:18] but the bride came back because she is
[12:21] Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor
[12:24] has made him a masterpiece for it is a
[12:26] piece of his first masterpiece like he
[12:29] made in the Garden of Eden and took a
[12:31] piece from and made it another piece
[12:34] and that was Martin fell so
[12:40] going back to where we said you know
[12:41] with with the Elijah Ministry his the
[12:43] purpose of brother bran was to point
[12:44] back at the original church right it was
[12:47] his it was brother Brown's voice that
[12:49] kept the this when the bride came in
[12:50] View the second time it was brother she
[12:52] watched him when she came to you the
[12:54] second time not so much the first time
[12:57] right
[12:58] and so
[13:00] what is what it's indicating is that
[13:02] there's there's a first church and then
[13:03] brother Brandon's job is to keep us in
[13:05] line so that we could remain as the as
[13:06] the when the Bride Comes in View the
[13:08] second time right it's a it's a
[13:10] restoration of what came in the
[13:11] beginning
[13:13] and so in this this thought of that his
[13:16] voice continues after him
[13:19] um
[13:21] you know this this brought to my mind
[13:22] Revelations chapter 10.
[13:25] and so I'm gonna I'm gonna read that uh
[13:27] we'll start it at verse one
[13:30] um and it says and I saw another Mighty
[13:32] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[13:34] the cloud and a rainbow was upon his
[13:36] head and his face was it were the Sun
[13:38] and his feet is pillars of fire which I
[13:40] you know thinking about what brother
[13:41] Donnie was preaching over the meetings
[13:43] talking about how you know every time
[13:45] there's a what God is trying to do in
[13:47] this age the devil is trying to mimic
[13:49] that
[13:50] um here you have the mighty Angel the
[13:52] rainbow about his head and in the same
[13:54] time you have the you know the rainbow
[13:56] Brigade marching through the churches
[13:59] right with their with their imitation
[14:04] um
[14:05] uh see and it um and he had his hand a
[14:08] little book
[14:09] um how much time I got not a lot so I'm
[14:11] going to skip some of this
[14:13] um
[14:15] uh her book and his right hand upon the
[14:17] seat he had left put upon the Earth and
[14:18] cried with a loud voice and um
[14:20] as when a lion roared and when he had
[14:22] cried seven Thunders out of their voices
[14:24] when seventh owners out of their voices
[14:26] I was about to write and I Heard a Voice
[14:28] from Heaven saying to me seal up those
[14:30] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[14:31] and write them not and the angel which I
[14:33] saw stand upon the scene upon the Earth
[14:35] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[14:37] that him by live forever and ever who
[14:39] created the Heaven and the things uh
[14:42] created heaven and the things that
[14:44] therein are and the Earth and things
[14:45] that there and are and the Sea and the
[14:46] things which are therein and there
[14:49] should be time no longer
[14:51] um it says but in the days of the voice
[14:53] of the seventh angel
[14:55] okay when he shall begin to sound the
[14:58] mystery of God should be finished as he
[15:00] hath declared to his servants the
[15:01] prophets
[15:03] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[15:04] spoken to me again and said go and take
[15:06] the little book which is open in the
[15:08] hand of the Angel which standeth upon
[15:10] the sea and upon the Earth and I went
[15:12] unto the angel and said to him give me
[15:14] the book give me the little book
[15:16] and he's letting me take it and eat it
[15:18] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[15:20] and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[15:22] honey and I took the little book out of
[15:23] the hand of the Angel and ate it up and
[15:25] I was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[15:27] soon as I had eaten it my belly was
[15:29] bitter and he said to me that must
[15:31] prophesy again before many people and
[15:32] Nations and tongues and Kings okay
[15:35] so
[15:36] um
[15:38] I want to focus in on in starting in in
[15:41] verse 10 or in verse seven
[15:44] um where it says in the days of the
[15:45] voice of the seventh angel right it's in
[15:49] are we in the days of the seventh angel
[15:50] in a sense yeah but the Angel's gone the
[15:53] Angel's off the scene but we are in the
[15:55] day of his voice right his voice has
[15:57] continued on
[15:59] um and you begin to sound and
[16:01] uh it is in that under that voice
[16:06] that the mysteries of all the mysteries
[16:08] of God are finished
[16:09] okay
[16:12] um
[16:13] and so it's and it uh comes down here
[16:15] and so John which I don't really have
[16:17] time to
[16:19] really get into because I have five
[16:20] minutes left
[16:22] um uh is is this type of the bride and
[16:26] so the bride after this you know as the
[16:28] seventh angel is sounding then has to go
[16:30] and prophesy herself
[16:32] right if if we're John and we have to
[16:34] prophesy again
[16:37] what does that really mean
[16:38] right
[16:40] because are we all Prophets
[16:42] right
[16:43] I mean Bibles is where prophets priests
[16:45] and kings
[16:46] but we're not bringing a new word
[16:49] right we're not we're not revealing some
[16:52] new mystery
[16:54] you know
[16:56] um
[16:57] but there's this there's one of my I
[17:01] think it's a beautiful quote it's from
[17:03] God's only provided place of worship
[17:07] um and it said but in the day when the
[17:09] son of man will be manifested revealed
[17:12] brought back the church together with
[17:14] the entire deity of God him amongst his
[17:16] people showing the same visible signs
[17:19] manifesting himself like he did at the
[17:21] beginning
[17:22] when he was manifested on Earth in a
[17:24] form of a prophet of a prophet God right
[17:27] he hyphenated it's hyphenated there it's
[17:29] a prophet God glory
[17:31] promised by Malachi 4.
[17:34] it says
[17:35] uh look Enoch was a Living Word of God
[17:40] of his age he was a prophet
[17:43] a prophet is God's reflector
[17:46] how many knows that the reflector
[17:48] doesn't reflect itself the reflector
[17:51] isn't the reflection
[17:54] there has to be something strike the
[17:56] reflector to make it reflect
[17:58] so a prophet is a chosen vessel of God
[18:01] that cannot reflect nothing at all
[18:04] but he's in direct line with that
[18:06] reflection God to reflect the image of
[18:09] Christ the word
[18:10] see nothing else can do it okay so here
[18:14] we have this image site mental picture
[18:15] here's a mirror it's a prophet there's
[18:18] the light the word God God is light
[18:21] strikes the the mirror of the prophet
[18:24] and then that Prophet directs that to
[18:26] the people and so we can look at the
[18:28] mirror and see the light of God shining
[18:30] off of that prop reflector prophet and
[18:33] say well that's God but
[18:34] it is
[18:36] but the mirror's not God the reflection
[18:38] is God right the prophet is not his
[18:40] message
[18:42] he is a reflector of the message and he
[18:46] without the reflector we wouldn't see
[18:47] the message
[18:48] and so it's important to have him right
[18:50] otherwise we'd be way out of Step
[18:53] but we also recognize that
[18:57] God is the actual thing that we're
[18:59] seeing here okay and to really turn our
[19:01] worship towards uh towards the The Giver
[19:05] of the light
[19:07] and then so he comes out and he says to
[19:09] reflect the image of Christ the word see
[19:11] nothing else can do it and then period
[19:14] you are a reflector
[19:16] that's the reason the prophet had to eat
[19:18] the book
[19:19] that's the reason he had to eat the
[19:21] scroll he had to reflect the word for
[19:24] that age you got it
[19:26] well okay this is John prophesying again
[19:28] right we're not bringing some new word
[19:31] we're just simply re-manifesting the
[19:35] same word
[19:36] that was in the beginning right the
[19:38] bride becomes a reflector that reflects
[19:41] the first church
[19:43] and so um
[19:45] you know everything that was
[19:47] everything that was there has to be
[19:49] again this is
[19:52] I mean I don't know maybe
[19:54] I know kind of growing up in the message
[19:56] a lot of times it's kind of like you you
[19:57] read you know hear about people talk
[19:59] about this and it's like okay well
[20:01] how does this help me put my pants on on
[20:03] Monday and go to work right like because
[20:05] it's all these Wonder these deep dark
[20:07] Mysteries and you know my wife always
[20:09] asked me what I'm if she knows I'm doing
[20:10] Sunday school or preaching whatever she
[20:11] always ask me what are you going to talk
[20:12] about and I try to tell her something
[20:14] and then I I
[20:16] you know kind of told her my notes last
[20:18] night she's like wow that kind of went
[20:19] over my head
[20:21] I said yeah okay fair enough well
[20:24] because you know it's well it's
[20:26] Mysteries and it's types and it's oh if
[20:28] you don't have a mind for it and you
[20:29] don't catch it okay great well so I told
[20:31] her all right look
[20:33] God is as complicated as you want him to
[20:35] be right it's one of the most beautiful
[20:37] things about God is as complicated as
[20:39] you want them to be if you want
[20:40] Mysteries there's mysteries for days you
[20:42] will spend your lifetime trying to get
[20:44] through it and never do it okay but he's
[20:47] as simple as you need him to be
[20:49] okay everything that I just said can be
[20:51] condensed into like a couple sentences
[20:53] which is
[20:56] God cares about you a whole lot
[20:58] and he cared so much about you that he
[21:01] engineered time and space to have
[21:04] someone on the earth who could explain
[21:05] all of this to you and that person's a
[21:08] prophet
[21:10] and that Prophet brought a message that
[21:11] would point you back to God who cares
[21:13] about you so much
[21:14] and that there's God care that prophet's
[21:17] message was to tell you that when the
[21:20] storms of life come there's a God who is
[21:22] deeply invested in your life and has
[21:25] power to help you that when you're sick
[21:27] there's healing when there's when
[21:29] there's trouble there's there's there's
[21:31] Comfort when there's all these things
[21:33] God is deeply there's not some it's not
[21:35] a fairy tale and it's not a Bible story
[21:37] you know people think oh well
[21:39] you know the Miracles were for the Bible
[21:41] days well when did the Bible stop being
[21:44] relevant
[21:45] um we're still in the Bible days
[21:47] um you know there's all of these things
[21:49] and so the way it helps you
[21:52] what the whole summation is is
[21:56] that there's there's a
[21:59] there isn't this big Chasm between you
[22:01] and God there isn't there's there's a
[22:04] there's a a God who cares about you so
[22:07] much
[22:09] that he gave you his everything that he
[22:11] is
[22:12] right there and and for whatever you
[22:15] might need and all those stories in the
[22:18] Bible about the the first church again
[22:20] when it says you know writing a book of
[22:22] Acts again after what would come in the
[22:24] last days
[22:25] I mean
[22:28] as there's an old saying um
[22:31] there's an old saying that goes well
[22:33] it's it's actually I think Stalin said
[22:35] this said uh a million deaths or a
[22:38] single death is a tragedy and a million
[22:39] deaths is a statistic
[22:41] because you can't really get your head
[22:43] around a million deaths because but you
[22:45] can get your head around one death right
[22:46] you can really empathize with one person
[22:48] but you can't really live with a million
[22:49] people it's too big
[22:50] I feel like we kind of have a similar
[22:51] kind of attitude when it's like Bible
[22:53] stories it's like oh there's all these
[22:55] stories in the Bible and okay well you
[22:57] know Jarius had a had a daughter and she
[22:59] died and Jesus came and rose from the
[23:00] dead or you know there's a crippled man
[23:02] who was by the wayside begging and Peter
[23:04] and John went by and you know said
[23:06] Silver and Gold Have I None and then he
[23:07] could walk and it's kind of clinical and
[23:10] and there's not a lot of
[23:13] well okay but
[23:16] The Man by the wayside begging had a
[23:18] family
[23:18] and he couldn't go to work for maybe 30
[23:20] years
[23:21] and they starved
[23:24] and so when Peter and John Peter and
[23:27] when they when he got his healing there
[23:31] was a real human story there
[23:33] and a lot of the times we get so hung up
[23:36] in our individual
[23:39] problems and it's like oh well I have
[23:40] this sickness or I have this financial
[23:42] problem or I have a marriage problem or
[23:43] I have a whatever problem
[23:47] and
[23:49] it's hard to connect that to the almost
[23:52] like historical recounting of
[23:55] the Church of the book of Acts
[23:59] but
[24:01] it's the same God there and so when when
[24:05] it talks about they're going to write
[24:06] another book of Acts it means
[24:09] friend that sickness that's been
[24:11] crushing you for 30 years you don't have
[24:14] to actually deal with it anymore
[24:16] there is actually power on the earth to
[24:18] heal you there is actually power on the
[24:21] earth to go find that
[24:25] you know to to fix your wretched
[24:27] condition right whatever you know
[24:31] there's
[24:34] the amount of
[24:36] of Brokenness that people have in their
[24:40] lives that God is more than able to
[24:42] repair
[24:45] it's not
[24:47] I don't know it's it
[24:49] I just if I could if I could just convey
[24:52] anything
[24:53] because I'm really out of time and I
[24:55] gotta I gotta stop
[24:57] um it's that
[25:00] there's
[25:02] it's not the Mysteries are here
[25:05] again it's we can make it as academic
[25:07] and as complicated as we want to make it
[25:09] the if I could just condense it down to
[25:11] one thing it would be
[25:15] just understand
[25:17] that the love of God is so big it can
[25:21] condense all the mysteries of the
[25:23] universe down to a single thing is that
[25:25] Jesus loves you so much that he will fix
[25:28] anything that you need him to and that
[25:30] all of your problems can be can be
[25:32] healed so we'll we'll end it there and
[25:36] uh thanks for
[25:38] hopefully my rambling will have helped
[25:39] you a little bit
