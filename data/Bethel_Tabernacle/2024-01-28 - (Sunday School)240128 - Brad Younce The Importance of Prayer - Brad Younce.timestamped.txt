[0:28] the singing the special singing the most
[0:30] of all the minister in the word father I
[0:32] pray may we place this service today
[0:34] into your hands in Jesus
[0:36] name I want to read in uh one scripture
[0:39] to start with in uh James chapter
[0:42] 5 I'll read verse
[0:49] 16 it says confess your faults one to
[0:53] another pray one for another that ye may
[0:57] be
[0:58] healed the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:01] righteous man availeth much you may have
[1:05] your
[1:06] seats put a title to this I want to put
[1:09] under the title the importance of
[1:11] prayer you know prayer is the most
[1:13] important thing in our
[1:15] life you know we can't live without it
[1:18] you know like food and you got to eat to
[1:20] live you got to drink to live you got to
[1:23] rest sleep to live that's important we
[1:26] need that as as human beings but as
[1:29] Spiritual Beings we need prayer prayer
[1:31] more than anything prayer is the most
[1:34] important thing in our
[1:35] life you know we need we need prayer to
[1:38] survive you know you can eat too much
[1:41] you can drink too much you can sleep too
[1:43] much you can talk too much you can shop
[1:47] too much but you can never pray too
[1:50] much 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says pray
[1:54] without
[1:56] ceasing as to pray to pray and to pray
[2:01] again it's praying all day long it's
[2:04] when you're at Walmart even when you're
[2:06] at Walmart you got a prayer on your
[2:07] heart that's what prayer you don't have
[2:09] to need to be on your knees to be to be
[2:10] praying without ceasing you know when
[2:13] you're cleaning house when you're
[2:14] cooking you got a prayer on your heart
[2:17] we're praying pray without ceasing but
[2:19] what is prayer I know this is going to
[2:21] be simple but it's good to be reminded
[2:24] every now and then prayer is giving our
[2:26] attention to God in a two-way spiritual
[2:29] Rel relationship where we talk to God
[2:32] and we listen we're not doing all the
[2:35] Talking you we know people that way you
[2:38] have a conversation with people and you
[2:41] barely can get a word
[2:42] in you know what I'm talking about you
[2:45] barely can get a word in so what's what
[2:47] we don't need to be doing that with God
[2:48] when we're praying it's a two-way
[2:50] conversation it's like a kid it's like
[2:52] your child they come to you they want
[2:53] come for advice they're W to ask for
[2:56] something I need a new pair of shoes
[2:58] they're coming to you asking that's what
[3:00] we need to come to God asking God for
[3:02] things it's our conversation with
[3:05] him but we got to have to stop long
[3:08] enough to hear God's
[3:10] response sometimes we don't we just want
[3:13] to pray pray pray pray pray pray and we
[3:15] get up and okay I got my prayer in for a
[3:17] day and I'm done what we need to do is
[3:20] kind of wait you know be like Elijah
[3:23] waiting there for
[3:24] something because sometimes God ain't
[3:26] going to come in a fire god ain't going
[3:28] to come in a storm but he's going to
[3:29] come in that still Small Voice we just
[3:31] sit silent long enough we'll be able to
[3:33] hear from
[3:36] him we just want to pause long enough
[3:38] that we can hear him speak you know you
[3:41] heard that saying that it used to be a
[3:45] Sweet Hour of Prayer it's now turned
[3:47] into a little talk with
[3:52] Jesus prayer is like a child's
[3:54] conversation I just said that what's it
[3:56] mean to pray pray is to intreat or
[4:00] implore it's often used in introducing a
[4:03] question a request or a plea to get or
[4:06] bring by
[4:08] praying what do you have need of praying
[4:12] brings it
[4:13] on to make a request in a humble manner
[4:18] it's not getting up there when you get
[4:19] on your knees God I need this right
[4:23] now God's just going to sit back and let
[4:25] you just
[4:27] go you can't demand God of what you
[4:31] want we he he ain't going to answer us
[4:34] if we start demanding acting like we're
[4:35] all something but humble manner to
[4:38] address god with
[4:40] adoration confession supplication
[4:43] Thanksgiving
[4:45] Worship in that little list I didn't
[4:47] hear anything I didn't read anything
[4:49] about asking
[4:51] yet sometimes that's what we do I'm
[4:53] guilty a lot of times we'll sit there
[4:55] especially if you have a need it's
[4:57] pressing you'll start your prayer father
[4:59] I love love you Lord I need Lord can I
[5:01] have this right now I need this I need
[5:03] that I need
[5:05] this but there's an approach to
[5:08] God it's not Our Father which art in
[5:10] Heaven this is what I
[5:14] want Matthew 6:5 he's going to tell us
[5:17] how to pray when thou prayest Thou shalt
[5:20] not be as the Hypocrites are for they
[5:23] love to pray standing in the synagogues
[5:26] and in the corners of the streets that
[5:27] they may be seen of men
[5:30] because verily I say unto you they have
[5:32] their
[5:33] reward but thou when thou prayest enter
[5:38] into thy closet amen and when thou H has
[5:42] shut the
[5:44] door if you don't have a closet big
[5:47] enough it's not necessarily be a closet
[5:50] you just get in and shut the world out
[5:53] amen turn off your phones turn off the
[5:56] internet turn off everything get in a
[5:58] quiet place with God get away from
[6:01] family get away from your husband get
[6:03] away from your wife get away from your
[6:04] children get back in there behind the
[6:07] holiest of holies where God could speak
[6:10] to
[6:11] us where it's just be just you and God
[6:15] that's what happens when the priest when
[6:16] they went behind the veil they took the
[6:18] needs of all the people they crossed
[6:20] behind that Veil it was just them and
[6:22] God
[6:25] Amen pray
[6:27] through is praying until you get the
[6:30] victory I tried to find the quote I I
[6:33] don't think I was typing it in right but
[6:34] you hear preachers say it all the time
[6:36] brother BR says that a Christian should
[6:38] pray through every
[6:41] day amen amen what's praying through
[6:45] praying through until you get the
[6:47] victory over something praying through
[6:49] until you get an answer to a problem if
[6:51] you got a even if you got a question
[6:52] about this message is it right or wrong
[6:55] get in your closet and pray until God
[6:57] reveals it to you
[7:02] hallelujah what they need is an old fash
[7:05] said what they need is an oldfashioned
[7:07] prayer altar where they pray until they
[7:10] pray through until they lose themselves
[7:13] come and pro God's provided way until
[7:16] they free themselves from the world
[7:20] am again he's talking about the children
[7:22] of Israel if they faed to eat the Mana
[7:24] they died if we fail to eat on the Holy
[7:27] Ghost we die if we fail to pray through
[7:32] daily wow there it
[7:35] is put that in this morning I didn't
[7:37] even recognize it if we fail to pray
[7:41] through daily all the time keep under
[7:45] the blood you'll wither up and die in
[7:47] your Christian
[7:49] experience he says he's living where the
[7:51] man is fresh all the time where it isn't
[7:54] a burden to get out and pray through
[7:57] today pray through tomorrow
[8:00] brother stay with him all the time in
[8:02] the holiest of holies can a person live
[8:05] that way absolutely he says that's what
[8:09] Jesus died
[8:12] for when thou prayest enter into thy
[8:15] closet when thou has shut the door pray
[8:17] to the Father which is in secret and thy
[8:20] father which in seeth in secret shall
[8:23] reward thee
[8:26] openly but when you pray
[8:29] use not vain
[8:32] repetition which is
[8:34] stuttering we get that way sometimes we
[8:38] said well I got to pray you're like I
[8:40] don't really know what to say and you
[8:41] get down there and you just
[8:42] start don't even make any
[8:47] sense
[8:49] amen if y'all not like that pray for
[8:52] me to stutter or
[8:56] repeat say the same things over and over
[8:59] we find ourselves doing
[9:01] that Lord father forgive me of my sins
[9:04] and you'll go pray father forgive me my
[9:05] sins pray father forgive me my sins you
[9:07] don't ask once that's all you need to
[9:10] ask
[9:12] well that's all right brother JD will be
[9:14] back next
[9:17] week to use many Idle
[9:21] Words the words we use have tremendous
[9:25] power the Bible says that life and death
[9:27] are in the power of the tongue
[9:30] you know I believe our prayers would
[9:31] have more power and a greater anointing
[9:34] when our everyday life is filled with
[9:36] words that can uplift and bring Grace to
[9:40] others
[9:42] wow Power of
[9:44] Words we have so much
[9:47] power that whatever we say will come to
[9:49] pass amen ask what you will when you
[9:53] pray and it shall be
[9:56] done Ephesians 4:29 sayso not let any
[9:59] UNH wholesome talk come out of your
[10:01] mouth but only what is helpful for
[10:03] building others up according to their
[10:06] needs that it may benefit those who
[10:10] listen a holy life is
[10:12] powerful when it comes to seeing answers
[10:14] to prayer even Jesus had to
[10:17] submit because Hebrews 5:7 says during
[10:19] the days of Jesus life on Earth he
[10:21] offered up prayers and petitions with
[10:23] fervent cries and tears to the one who
[10:27] could save him from death
[10:30] and he was heard and he was heard
[10:33] because of his reverent
[10:36] submission Jesus had to submit himself
[10:39] to the
[10:40] father we're no different we're not
[10:43] special we even more so have to submit
[10:45] ourselves to the
[10:47] father if we submit ourselves to him we
[10:50] will see our prayers answered amen
[10:53] righteous living and right speech come
[10:55] from a right heart before
[10:57] God so it's important for all of us who
[11:00] want to have an effective prayer life is
[11:03] to watch our
[11:05] speech watch what we
[11:08] say okay we'll move on from
[11:11] that there's a lot of things you get in
[11:12] with a
[11:14] tongue but when you pray use not vain
[11:17] repetition has Heathen
[11:20] do for they think they shall be heard
[11:22] for they're much speaking we've heard
[11:25] that we've been in places me and my wife
[11:27] was somewhere not too long ago with a a
[11:29] brother
[11:30] who's you say one of the main Ministers
[11:33] of the message we was at this church
[11:35] where he was ministering and this
[11:36] brother gets up and
[11:39] prays and we're kind of looking at each
[11:41] other like what and is he trying to
[11:43] prove he was trying to be so elegant try
[11:46] to lift himself up make him sound like
[11:48] he was
[11:49] something we've seen it people pray so
[11:52] loud that nobody else can pray there's
[11:54] nothing wrong with that but are you
[11:55] doing it for the right reason amen are
[11:59] we praying for the right
[12:02] reason be not ye therefore like unto
[12:06] them for your father here it is your
[12:08] father knoweth what things you have need
[12:10] of even before you
[12:13] ask you know disciples like wow teach us
[12:16] to
[12:18] pray they they seen the Pharisees and
[12:20] the Sadducees and all those people that
[12:23] does stuff like that they seen them pray
[12:25] yeah so when Jesus comes and says this
[12:27] they're like uhoh we don't even know how
[12:29] to pray so teach us okay Jesus says well
[12:33] after this
[12:34] manner When you
[12:36] pray Our
[12:39] Father which are in heaven you start
[12:41] praising him Hallowed be thy name amen
[12:45] thy kingdom
[12:47] come thy will be done are we praying for
[12:51] his kingdom to come right we should be
[12:54] praying for his kingdom to come every
[12:56] day even so Lord Jesus come quick
[13:01] you haven't asked for a need
[13:04] yet thy will be done amen so you mean
[13:08] some of my prayers are not going to be
[13:09] answered thy will be done in earth as it
[13:14] is in heaven
[13:15] amen give us this day our daily bread
[13:20] did y'all get up this morning pray for
[13:21] the service this morning you can pray
[13:23] for your pastor give us this day our
[13:26] daily bread because he has spiritual
[13:27] food in due seasons for us forgive us
[13:30] our trespasses as we forgive those who
[13:33] trespassed against us it says depths but
[13:37] it's the same
[13:38] thing we can't even forgive we can't ask
[13:41] God to forgive us until we forgive our
[13:45] brother my goodness and lead us not into
[13:50] temptation but Deliver us from
[13:55] evil Lord the devil's going to be sting
[13:57] a trap out for us he he does it every
[14:00] day but how many times has God steered
[14:03] you around that trap you may not have
[14:05] know it you're like why am I going this
[14:09] way why am I late for work why could I
[14:12] get my car started
[14:14] until later God looking out for you lead
[14:18] us not into temptation but Deliver Us
[14:20] from Evil for thine is the
[14:24] kingdom and the power and the glory
[14:27] forever
[14:31] and he ends it with an
[14:33] amen that's there's your pattern for
[14:36] prayer that's a quick
[14:40] prayer you can add to it just pray this
[14:43] is this is your order right here of
[14:45] prayer James 5:13 it says is if any is
[14:49] any among you Afflicted let him
[14:54] pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms is
[14:59] any sick among you let him call for the
[15:02] Elders of the church and let them pray
[15:05] over him amen anointing him with oil in
[15:08] the name of the Lord and the prayer of
[15:10] the faith shall save the sick and the
[15:15] Lord shall raise him up and if he had
[15:17] committed sins they shall be forgiven
[15:21] him
[15:22] amen and then are open confess your
[15:24] faults one to another pray for one
[15:27] another that ye may may be healed
[15:30] because the effectual
[15:32] fervent effectual is producing or able
[15:35] to produce a desired
[15:38] effect fervent is to be active
[15:42] efficient are we efficient in our
[15:46] prayers to be operated to be at work to
[15:48] put forth power is your prayer full of
[15:51] power to work for
[15:54] one of the effectual fervent prayer of a
[15:58] righteous man ath much aaop is to have
[16:02] to exercise
[16:05] force to be strong to have power to have
[16:10] power has shown by extraordinary Deeds
[16:13] so that's what a effectual fervent
[16:16] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[16:20] amen if you're praying and you're a
[16:22] fervent prayer it's going to Avil you
[16:24] much
[16:25] yeah brother says the prayer of the
[16:27] faith shall save the sin an individual
[16:30] prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a
[16:33] righteous man availeth much only if you
[16:36] knew that in your hand Christ has gave
[16:40] us the authority with his name by being
[16:43] Christians the most powerful weapon the
[16:47] world has ever
[16:49] known prayer it even changes everything
[16:53] amen it'll even change the mind of
[16:57] God
[16:59] you know I seen this the other day and I
[17:01] I just wrote it down just just one
[17:02] little line pray about it as much as you
[17:06] think about
[17:09] it if we have problems how how many how
[17:11] how long how many hours a day do we sit
[17:13] and think about that
[17:15] problem instead of think about just pray
[17:17] it just pray about it commit it to God
[17:20] brother said the prayer is the most
[17:22] powerful weapon that was placed in the
[17:24] control of the human
[17:26] beings and expectation he says prayer is
[17:29] the key it's the answer Prayer Changes
[17:32] Things prayer is the most powerful
[17:35] weapon that was ever put in control of
[17:40] the human
[17:41] being there's no atomic bomb or no
[17:44] hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer
[17:49] amen you know how powerful atomic bomb
[17:52] is you know happened in World War II
[17:53] when they dropped that bomb over Japan
[17:55] it destroyed everything in its
[17:57] path
[17:59] that's what prayer
[18:00] is when you go down to your knees I
[18:03] don't care if you're the weakest
[18:04] Christians because we know when the
[18:06] weakest Christian gets down on their
[18:07] knees the devil trembles
[18:10] amen but what a weapon we
[18:13] have what are you praying about that's
[18:15] how much power you have you know we're
[18:18] like in B52 bombers we're loaded down
[18:21] with
[18:23] bombs I've read where this B52 they can
[18:25] carry up to 880,000 lbs of bombs at a
[18:28] time
[18:28] yeah and fly over 8,000 miles before
[18:31] they
[18:32] refuel so you're loaded down with bombs
[18:35] this
[18:38] morning your prayer will fly over the
[18:41] Enemy what is it you have need of what's
[18:44] bothering you what are you praying
[18:48] about if you got lust and you're praying
[18:50] about
[18:52] it fly over that let your prayer throw
[18:55] that and a bomb will drop and totally
[18:57] destroy it
[18:59] amen you got depression or anxiety just
[19:02] start praying God that prayer will fly
[19:05] over that and a bomb will drop on it and
[19:07] destroy
[19:09] it sickness will be
[19:12] destroyed but we don't use this weapon
[19:16] enough you know prayer will even change
[19:19] the mind of God prayer changes things we
[19:23] know the story about King
[19:25] Hezekiah he was sick God told Isaiah
[19:29] said hey go over there and tell that man
[19:33] that he's going to
[19:35] die so Isaiah goes up to the king says
[19:38] Hey King thus sayith the Lord you're
[19:41] going to
[19:43] die so what Hezekiah
[19:46] do he got out his pen and
[19:49] paper my last will in
[19:52] Testament I leave my entire Kingdom to
[19:54] my
[19:56] firstborn I leave my wife this I leave
[19:58] my kids this
[20:01] I no as soon as he got the
[20:04] word he turned his face to the
[20:09] wall and he prayed unto the Lord saying
[20:11] I beseech thee Oh Lord remember now how
[20:15] I have walked before thee in truth when
[20:18] with a perfect heart and have done that
[20:21] which is good in thy
[20:23] sight and Hezekiah wept
[20:27] sore then the next verse says that it
[20:29] came to pass Isaiah hadn't even gotten
[20:32] his Chariot yet and got down the
[20:33] driveway and God says stop
[20:36] Isaiah turn around and go back in there
[20:41] that's how quick Prayer Changes
[20:44] Things Isaiah had already told him what
[20:46] God had said and Isaiah had even left
[20:48] the house yet because the Bible says he
[20:51] was he had got through the middle
[20:53] court before God stopped
[20:55] him go back there and tell him I'm will
[20:57] give him 15 more
[21:00] years but I thought God's will was for
[21:02] him to die oh he's going to die
[21:04] eventually but he asked God for 15 more
[21:07] he asked God to spare his life give him
[21:09] more time amen God says okay I'll give
[21:11] you 15 more
[21:16] years that's
[21:20] powerful we could be on our death bed we
[21:23] could be dying with cancer or whatever
[21:25] some kind of
[21:26] disease and our prayer can have so much
[21:29] power it can actually go to God and say
[21:31] oh I'm gonna give them a little more
[21:32] longer to live yeah they might be 95 but
[21:35] hey let's see if they can make it to
[21:38] 110 Lord I don't want to live to be
[21:41] 110 if I'm the way I am now I hate to
[21:43] see when I'm
[21:46] 100 but that's how quick prayer changes
[21:51] things you can never pray too
[21:54] much we can't be afraid to pray either
[21:58] remember
[21:59] Daniel we heard it Wednesday
[22:02] night they want to get Daniel for his
[22:04] prayer they won't get Daniel in trouble
[22:06] CU he's the favor of the king amen he
[22:08] said I don't
[22:10] care I if I pray I'm going to get in the
[22:12] lines then he'll just go right up open
[22:14] wide his window and said hey guys I'm

[23:01] John 14:14 says ye shall ask anything in
[23:03] my name I will do
[23:06] it when you pray he will do
[23:11] it prayer changes the mind of God you
[23:14] believe
[23:16] that God is wanting us to pray but
[23:19] there's things that you can
[23:21] do that God cannot
[23:24] do brother Caleb read this Wednesday
[23:26] night

[23:53] until we do it
[23:56] amen he says we're are the branches he's
[23:58] the vine but the vine can't bear fruit
[24:01] it's the branches that bear fruit is
[24:04] that right he furnishes the
[24:07] energy he gives you the ability but
[24:10] we've got to do the
[24:12] job you get what I mean the holy
[24:15] spirit's here as you see him each night
[24:18] and he knows you but the only way he
[24:21] speaks is through
[24:23] us is that
[24:25] right our hands are his hands
[24:28] our eyes are his eyes notice he gives us
[24:33] things so Jesus will stand there one day

[25:05] pray When you pray believe that whatever
[25:08] you pray is going to happen that
[25:10] whatever you say is going to
[25:12] happen he says you ask the lord of the
[25:14] Harvest because the Harvest is ripe the
[25:16] labors are few in other words you ask me
[25:20] to do what I
[25:22] know ought to be
[25:25] done God knows it ought to be done
