[2:29] stand and read a scripture real quick
[2:33] if y'all would turn to genesis chapter 1
[2:37] and we'll look at chapter 1 and verse
[2:48] 27. all right
[2:51] it says
[2:52] so god created man in his own image
[2:55] and the image of god created he him male
[2:57] and female created he them and god
[3:00] blessed them and god said unto them be
[3:02] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[3:04] earth and subdue it and have dominion
[3:06] over the fish of the sea over the fowl
[3:08] of the air and over every living thing
[3:10] that moveth upon the earth let's
[3:12] have a word of prayer father we ask that
[3:14] you would anoint the
[3:16] word that was about to go forth father
[3:17] that you would anoint my lips and my
[3:19] heart and my mind that i would speak
[3:21] what you would have me speak father
[3:23] and that
[3:24] people would hear what you would need
[3:25] them to hear father they would be able
[3:26] to sharpen their swords to fight the
[3:28] devil in the days and weeks and months
[3:30] going forward we ask these things in
[3:32] jesus name amen
[3:34] y'all can be seated um
[3:36] and uh go ahead all right cool this
[3:38] thing work awesome
[3:40] so um i gotta you know it's a real
[3:42] sunday school because i got a powerpoint
[3:44] today um
[3:45] but uh so um
[3:47] you see my title there by their fruits
[3:50] um
[3:51] and you know referring to the scripture
[3:53] where jesus said by their fruits you
[3:54] shall know them um
[3:56] but i had a subtitle as let every seed
[3:59] bring forth of its own kind now
[4:01] we've all heard that phrase um though
[4:04] it's not really i couldn't locate it
[4:07] actually in the scripture um
[4:09] through every search engine that i could
[4:11] find the bible never actually explicitly
[4:13] says that phrase exactly what it does do
[4:17] is starting in the book of genesis
[4:19] um
[4:20] in genesis chapter one and and we'll
[4:23] just read it here
[4:24] and it says and god said let every
[4:27] let the earth bring forth grass and herb
[4:29] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[4:31] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[4:33] is in itself upon the earth and it was
[4:35] so
[4:36] and the earth brought forth grass in her
[4:38] building seed after its kind and the
[4:39] tree yuling fruit whose seed was in
[4:41] itself after his kind and god saw that
[4:44] it was good and then again in chat in
[4:46] verse 21 and god created the great
[4:48] whales and every living creature that
[4:49] moves moveth which was which the waters
[4:52] brought forth abundantly after their
[4:54] kind and every winged foul after his
[4:57] kind and god saw that it was good
[4:59] and god blessed them saying be fruitful
[5:01] and multiply and fill the waters in the
[5:03] seas and let fowl multiply on the earth
[5:06] and in
[5:09] verse 24 and god said let the earth
[5:11] bring forth the living creature after
[5:13] his kind and cattle and creeping thing
[5:15] and peace of the earth after his kind
[5:17] and it was so
[5:19] and god made the beast of the earth
[5:20] after his kind and cattle after their
[5:23] kind and everything that creepeth upon
[5:25] the earth after his kind and god saw
[5:27] that it was good
[5:28] so what we have is we see this pattern
[5:30] where god creates creatures and then
[5:32] within them is a seed to replicate
[5:34] themselves
[5:35] right within them is a is the
[5:37] instructions that they would need
[5:39] everything that they would need
[5:40] to continue and continue to bring forth
[5:43] after their own kind so we get this
[5:44] phrase every single every seed brings
[5:46] forth of its own kind it's it's more of
[5:48] a principle than an exact quote and so
[5:51] um we can now if we go down to our
[5:54] actual text which i didn't put my
[5:55] powerpoint to verse 27 so we see this
[5:58] progression right we see the plants then
[5:59] the fish and the birds then the animals
[6:01] on the land and then finally in verse 27
[6:04] so god created man after his own image
[6:07] right he's continuing the pattern if the
[6:09] if the
[6:10] plants and animals he created and that
[6:12] they would recreate after their kind
[6:15] then the fish and the birds would
[6:17] recreate after their kind and then the
[6:19] animals in the land would recreate after
[6:20] their kind in verse 27 it's god
[6:22] recreating after his kind
[6:24] okay and that that the
[6:27] the the man that he would put on the
[6:28] earth would also have within him the
[6:31] seed that he would need to recreate
[6:33] itself right that the man would recreate
[6:36] what created him
[6:38] right if if the plant
[6:40] if this if if the the plants that would
[6:42] come from their parental plants would
[6:44] create plants then the people that would
[6:46] come from god would recreate god
[6:49] okay
[6:50] so
[6:52] really we when we look at this
[6:55] this is
[6:56] you know
[6:57] in the bible they use the archaic terms
[6:58] like seed or you know things like that
[7:01] and we know
[7:02] really through modern science and
[7:04] through sort of modern understanding and
[7:06] through biology we understand what that
[7:08] seed is referring to is genetics
[7:10] right
[7:11] i mean a plant seed and an animal seed
[7:13] are two very different different things
[7:15] if you look at them objectively
[7:16] biologically the only really thing that
[7:18] makes them
[7:20] you know
[7:20] that's in common between the two is a
[7:23] genetic package at the center of it
[7:25] right the the written instructions on
[7:26] how to recreate the creature that it's
[7:28] that that seed is intended to recreate
[7:31] and so
[7:32] what we might say is that every genetics
[7:36] recreates itself okay that would be
[7:38] another way of saying every seed brings
[7:40] forth of its own kind so
[7:42] because of this and i mean it the more i
[7:44] looked into this topic of genetics and
[7:46] dna because really when we talk about
[7:48] the field of genetics what we're talking
[7:49] about is dna right
[7:52] what were
[7:54] i mean the more it just it just blew up
[7:56] on me so um i want to do a quick little
[8:00] kind of wrap up my my thought here with
[8:01] this hopefully if
[8:03] i can contain it in the next 20 minutes
[8:06] or so um
[8:08] and so we look if we look at this is a
[8:11] sort of a very simple simplistic
[8:13] representation of what might be a human
[8:14] cell
[8:16] you can't really see it um because it
[8:18] might be a little small on my diagram
[8:20] there but you can see
[8:21] this
[8:22] a lot of different things there but
[8:23] really what we want to look at is that
[8:25] big purple circle kind of in the top
[8:27] right there okay it's called a nucleus
[8:29] inside that nucleus which
[8:31] unfortunately is a little small from
[8:32] what you can see out there probably is
[8:34] you can see a bunch of little squiggly
[8:35] lines okay in that nucleus bunch of
[8:37] little squiggly lines and that's your
[8:39] dna dna looks like a big long kind of
[8:41] like a piece of yarn with two
[8:43] two threads wound together
[8:45] and
[8:46] that dna is the instructions on how to
[8:48] recreate that cell
[8:49] not only that cell but everything in the
[8:52] body right i mean you think how does
[8:55] one creature know within itself how to
[8:57] recreate itself well it's because it's
[8:59] got written instructions dna on how to
[9:01] do that
[9:02] and every single cell in its body has a
[9:06] full set of instructions on how to
[9:08] recreate the entire body
[9:10] okay
[9:12] um you know if you have a
[9:14] but it's it's so not only does it have
[9:16] everything that it would have need of
[9:18] within that instructions it has
[9:20] everything that any other cell would
[9:22] have need of in that set of instructions
[9:24] right you say say you have you know in
[9:27] your body you have like a pancreas right
[9:29] and that pancreas you have little
[9:30] pancreas cells and they make you maybe
[9:32] you need insulin and that the job of
[9:34] that little pancreas cells to make
[9:35] insulin well given the right environment
[9:38] right you eat some sugar your blood
[9:39] sugar goes up well that pancreas cell
[9:43] on that string of dna there's little
[9:45] sections these sections are called genes
[9:48] there's a little tag on there called an
[9:49] epigenetic tag that when your blood
[9:51] sugar goes up it sends a signal
[9:52] activates that tag it opens up the gene
[9:54] for insulin
[9:56] and it expresses insulin
[9:58] right that's what that's the job of that
[10:00] cells is to do well
[10:03] same thing if you have an eye cell and
[10:05] it needs to do whatever eye cells do
[10:07] um it's got it's going to have the genes
[10:09] inside of it to teach it how to do that
[10:11] now you get a problem when a pancreas
[10:13] cell decides to be an eye cell that's
[10:15] called cancer
[10:16] right or if an eye cell decides to be a
[10:18] liver cell right this is not how it
[10:20] works right now we also have a set of
[10:22] instructions right basic instructions
[10:24] before leaving earth
[10:25] and we follow this and anything that we
[10:27] would have need of
[10:28] is in this in this seed in this set of
[10:30] instructions it's the instructions on
[10:32] how to recreate the entire body of
[10:34] christ
[10:35] now each one of us might have a
[10:36] different role right housewives have a
[10:38] different role than say deacons
[10:41] right but they have we have the
[10:43] instructions on how to do all of it
[10:45] right there's a lot of commonality
[10:46] between all of it but there are some
[10:47] instructions that are exclusive to
[10:48] deacons and there's some instructions
[10:49] that are exclusive to housewives right
[10:51] and if you get one doing the other then
[10:53] you get cancer
[10:55] okay
[10:57] now
[10:58] um
[11:00] and so as i would say that you know
[11:02] anything that that that little cell
[11:03] would have need of is in
[11:05] that set of instructions right if he
[11:06] needs healing well there's a gene for
[11:08] that right if he needs maybe he's he's
[11:10] uh got some problem that he doesn't know
[11:12] how to overcome well if he starts
[11:14] running through that genetics there's a
[11:15] set of there's a set of genes that can
[11:17] pretty much handle any problem that cell
[11:19] comes across
[11:22] um so
[11:25] um
[11:27] now
[11:28] there's a
[11:29] um
[11:31] there's another little thing i want to
[11:32] shoot i want you to see
[11:34] okay now some of y'all might recognize
[11:36] this guy
[11:37] okay after the last two years of kovid
[11:40] um this has become a pretty common
[11:42] little image
[11:44] and we already might recognize this as a
[11:46] virus well the world would call it a
[11:48] virus i'm going to show you that this is
[11:50] actually called the devil
[11:51] um so the way i know this is the devil
[11:54] is number one you see how it says viral
[11:56] surface proteins all over the outside
[11:58] well those little proteins
[12:01] most of that i would say about 99 of
[12:04] what's on the surface of that virus
[12:06] is the exact same thing that's on the
[12:08] surface of one of your cells right
[12:11] why because otherwise your cell wouldn't
[12:13] accept it
[12:14] right the virus the way it attacks
[12:17] is it comes up next to your cell and
[12:19] just integrates itself right in
[12:21] it just pushes itself right in and your
[12:23] cell will accept it
[12:25] why because it looks almost identical
[12:28] right it the devil's not going to come
[12:30] at you
[12:31] head-on he's going to come at you
[12:32] sideways and make it 99 the same
[12:35] okay
[12:36] not only that but if i go to this next
[12:39] picture
[12:40] now here's a just to give you a size
[12:41] comparison
[12:42] on the left there you got a red blood
[12:44] cell on the right you've got
[12:47] a covid virus
[12:49] okay that's the scale
[12:52] that little virus is tiny
[12:55] it's it's a little bitty thing it's
[12:56] nowhere near the size of one of your
[12:58] human cells it's a little bitty fox
[13:01] right it's these little things that look
[13:03] exactly like
[13:05] the actual body of christ but they've
[13:07] got something sinister hiding in there
[13:09] that one percent lie that's going to
[13:11] that's going to trip you up
[13:13] okay
[13:14] now
[13:16] the other thing um
[13:17] that i want to
[13:19] look at my notes here
[13:22] um
[13:23] so the reason why the virus is so small
[13:27] is because in your human cell we go back
[13:29] and oops excuse me oh oh no i have there
[13:32] we go
[13:33] all right you see all these little
[13:34] structures inside of there okay
[13:37] all those structures do stuff a lot of
[13:39] in involves um like uh reproduction
[13:42] specifically the other only other thing
[13:43] that i have marked out there is
[13:44] something called a ribosome that's
[13:45] actually what takes the instructions on
[13:47] the on the dna and makes it into a cell
[13:50] okay
[13:52] well you notice that guy doesn't have
[13:53] any of that
[13:54] that's why he's so small he doesn't have
[13:57] anything inside of him that will
[13:58] actually be able to produce anything
[14:01] he has no creative ability on his own
[14:03] just like the devil the devil has no
[14:05] creative power all he can do
[14:07] is that when he
[14:09] injects himself into the body of christ
[14:13] you can see those little squiggly lines
[14:16] now at the top is called rna for the
[14:17] purpose of this that's dna there are
[14:19] actually some viruses that use dna he's
[14:21] got a seed inside of him too yeah okay
[14:24] it's not a human seed
[14:26] it's a seed of discrepancy
[14:28] right
[14:29] he's got a seed that's going to recreate
[14:30] himself but he has no ability to do it
[14:32] on his own the only way
[14:34] that virus or the devil can ever
[14:36] recreate himself is to inject himself
[14:38] into the body of christ and hijack the
[14:42] creative capacity of the body of christ
[14:45] to reproduce his seed
[14:47] right that's it that's the only way he
[14:48] can do it and because that he can be
[14:50] small he can be sneaky because he
[14:52] doesn't have to be able to do it himself
[14:54] right all that's taken away um and all
[14:58] he's got is that seed of discrepancy
[14:59] that lie
[15:02] um
[15:03] and his purpose
[15:05] is to
[15:06] pervert
[15:08] the the true plan of god to to supplant
[15:11] the true seed that god put inside of
[15:13] humanity
[15:14] that that was god's seed to begin with
[15:16] because he made man after his own image
[15:21] and so if we look at the process of how
[15:24] how this would this would happen
[15:27] this virus would come in it would inject
[15:29] itself into the human body
[15:31] that seed would come in and it would um
[15:33] it would go into the nucleus and and
[15:36] completely there's they don't really
[15:37] have a label on there but there's other
[15:38] things in there that actually shut down
[15:40] the cell's ability to
[15:42] perform its own functions it no longer
[15:44] reads its own genetics and will only
[15:46] read that seed of discrepancy it takes a
[15:48] little bit of time to happen but it'll
[15:50] happen eventually
[15:51] and what happens
[15:53] is that
[15:55] viral genetics are being produced
[15:59] it'll just slowly make more and more
[16:00] viruses more and more of those viruses
[16:03] get produced until eventually the cell
[16:06] becomes so full of viruses
[16:09] it's no longer even performing the
[16:10] function that god intended to perform
[16:12] it's not reading
[16:14] the the instruct its own instructions
[16:16] that god intended it to read it's only
[16:19] feeding off you know only
[16:20] expressing this this this perverted seed
[16:24] and eventually becomes so full of
[16:26] viruses that it can't take anymore and
[16:28] the cell just explodes it erupts it
[16:30] ruptures and just blows all of these new
[16:32] brand new viruses all over everything
[16:34] around it okay
[16:37] and so we look at this and this is
[16:38] exactly what people will do they'll pick
[16:40] up some little thing that they don't
[16:42] think is such a big deal but it's got
[16:43] some sort of it's got a seat of
[16:45] discrepancy in the bottom of it they
[16:46] don't really realize and what'll end up
[16:49] happening
[16:50] is it'll come in and over time it'll
[16:52] supplant
[16:54] their reading
[16:55] of their true seed
[16:57] they'll stop feeding on the word you
[16:59] stop expressing the seed that god
[17:01] intended them to express stop expressing
[17:04] the dna that god intended to express
[17:06] they're no longer expressing the genes
[17:07] of god that were that was inside of them
[17:10] and instead they're expressing the genes
[17:11] of the devil
[17:13] and now here's the thing on the outside
[17:16] the little cells around it they don't
[17:18] know
[17:19] it's a mystery
[17:20] right they don't they don't know all
[17:22] they see is one day this thing just
[17:23] explodes
[17:25] one day their neighbor just blows up
[17:27] and is suddenly spewing a bunch of
[17:30] toxic nonsense that they have no idea
[17:32] where it came from
[17:34] right
[17:35] and the crazy thing is now one thing to
[17:37] note there it says it's rna instead of
[17:39] dna
[17:41] for the purpose of this is basically the
[17:42] same thing they do the exact same thing
[17:44] the difference is that rna is a little
[17:46] bit more unstable than dna
[17:48] which means it mutates it changes a lot
[17:51] of times
[17:53] so every time it's
[17:54] reproduced every time it's replicated
[17:56] it'll be a little bit different than the
[17:57] way it was before dna doesn't do that
[17:59] right god's word doesn't change but you
[18:01] get some lie of the devil someone will
[18:03] start with one thing and by the time
[18:04] they're by the time it all ends up
[18:06] they'll have two or three four different
[18:07] strains of it that ended up just you
[18:09] don't know what in the world you know
[18:11] where in the world it came from right
[18:13] because it just it multiplies errors
[18:17] and so
[18:19] here we have
[18:20] so so to the to other cells like you
[18:22] think okay how how does your body fight
[18:25] this
[18:26] right because the other cells they're
[18:27] not really going to know it's just like
[18:29] i said one day
[18:30] suddenly their neighbor is is
[18:32] gone crazy and they don't know what
[18:34] happened
[18:35] well
[18:39] in in the bible we get matthew chapter 7
[18:42] says beware of false prophets which seem
[18:44] to you in sheep which come to you in
[18:46] sheep's clothing but inwardly they are
[18:48] ravening wolves you shall know them by
[18:50] their fruits do men gather grapes of
[18:53] thorns or figs of thistles even so every
[18:56] good tree bringeth forth good fruit but
[18:59] a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit
[19:02] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[19:04] fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring
[19:06] forth good fruit every excuse me every
[19:09] tree that bringeth forth not uh bringeth
[19:12] not forth good fruit is hewn down and
[19:14] cast into the fire
[19:15] wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
[19:17] them
[19:18] okay
[19:20] so this is i wanna
[19:22] all right
[19:23] so this guy right here is a little thing
[19:24] in your body called natural killer cell
[19:26] also called lymphocytes if you've heard
[19:27] of those
[19:28] um and what this guy does is if if you
[19:31] want to if you want to
[19:33] so he goes around he's on patrol okay
[19:35] he's going all through your body
[19:37] and there's a little thing inside of all
[19:39] of your cells called
[19:41] i didn't put it on here called the major
[19:42] histocompatibility complex okay that's
[19:45] why i didn't put on the slide
[19:47] but this little thing called the mhc
[19:50] whenever your body is reproducing the
[19:52] genetics right you know actually
[19:53] expressing the genetics creates little
[19:55] proteins
[19:56] and it
[19:57] your body the little cells will will
[19:59] chop off pieces of those proteins every
[20:01] once in a while just like it'll just
[20:02] randomly select a protein that it
[20:03] creates chop it up into little bits and
[20:05] it attaches this mhc and then it goes
[20:08] and presents it on the outside of the
[20:09] cell
[20:10] okay
[20:11] why
[20:12] because this guy is on patrol and he's
[20:15] on the lookout he's got a special
[20:16] receptor on him that attaches to that
[20:18] mhc and then compares
[20:21] the protein that it's presenting to the
[20:24] genetics inside of it
[20:26] okay so it's saying i this this cell it
[20:29] has the original seed inside of it it
[20:31] has the untainted unpolluted
[20:35] word of god inside of it
[20:37] and it's going around and it's looking
[20:39] for any cells in the body that are
[20:41] presenting cells not in accordance with
[20:44] the with the word
[20:46] okay
[20:48] and
[20:49] so if it's producing viral protein
[20:51] right if there's a virus inside of it
[20:53] that's recreating itself on it might
[20:55] take a little bit of time but on the
[20:57] outside of that cell it will produce a
[20:59] section of that viral protein that that
[21:01] guy's going to see
[21:03] right it will not remain an internal
[21:05] affair when someone's full of viruses or
[21:09] this thing also just had cancer
[21:10] right because if it if you're if you if
[21:12] the cell becomes cancerous and it's
[21:14] reading that
[21:15] word incorrectly
[21:17] well that it's not going to match up to
[21:18] what this natural killer cell knows is
[21:21] accurate
[21:23] and it's going to do what the name
[21:25] implies when it comes across something
[21:27] that doesn't line up it's just going to
[21:28] kill it right it's not going to allow
[21:31] that to continue
[21:34] and so what we see
[21:37] what we see
[21:39] is within the body of christ you have to
[21:41] have a token on display on the outside
[21:46] because there's a death angel patrolling
[21:48] right
[21:49] we'll pick up
[21:50] let me see
[21:52] exodus chapter 12 and the blood shall be
[21:55] to you for a token upon the houses where
[21:58] you are and when i see the blood i will
[22:00] pass over you and the plague shall not
[22:02] be upon you to destroy you when i smite
[22:05] the land of egypt right
[22:07] all the way back to exodus where
[22:09] what that token was that blood over the
[22:11] doorpost was was god
[22:14] having the children of israel draw a
[22:16] petition a line between themselves and
[22:19] the rest of the world and say there was
[22:22] a price paid for these people but nobody
[22:24] else right there was a lamb they had
[22:26] followed the order of god's word
[22:29] and stepped into
[22:32] that word they were now expressing the
[22:34] genetics that god had would have of them
[22:36] right
[22:37] slaying the lamb putting that token over
[22:39] their door post
[22:40] so that when
[22:42] because if you actually read which i
[22:44] guess i can go ahead and read that
[22:46] because i have a few minutes um
[22:56] so if we come down um
[23:02] and it says in verse 1 and the lord's
[23:03] speaking to moses and aaron in the land
[23:05] of egypt saying uh this month she'll be
[23:07] under you the beginning of months it
[23:09] should be the first month
[23:11] to the year to you um
[23:14] uh hang on i'm gonna skip down a little
[23:16] bit
[23:27] um
[23:28] well i guess i don't have time to find
[23:29] it anyways the um
[23:31] the point is when in in chapter 12 when
[23:34] it says this it doesn't say it doesn't
[23:37] really say that that the death angel was
[23:39] going to come
[23:40] it said that god was going to come right
[23:43] god identified himself
[23:45] as that angel that was going to discern
[23:47] whether or not someone was falling
[23:49] within the line of order of god's word
[23:51] right if they would and and i always
[23:53] want to read
[23:54] um
[23:55] for and again i didn't have it uh
[23:58] time to to put it up but this is from
[24:00] the token
[24:01] um and it's brother brandon to give a
[24:03] little context his brother brandon
[24:04] talking about
[24:05] um how if uh if you know he was on trial
[24:08] for murder he'd go get a a an attorney
[24:11] and he'd want the best attorney that
[24:12] money could buy because you know his
[24:14] life is on the line
[24:16] right if and so he starts going down how
[24:18] god was was the judge and then all
[24:20] humanity was was on trial and then he
[24:22] said then he became not only the judge
[24:23] but the attorney as well
[24:25] um
[24:27] and so he says um
[24:29] uh the same one is judge is our attorney
[24:31] the case is settled we have the token
[24:34] both judge and attorney is the same
[24:35] person when god was made flesh and dwelt
[24:38] among us our judge became our attorney
[24:40] and the case is settled
[24:42] he says and the holy ghost is here for a
[24:46] token
[24:47] that we're ready to pass from here into
[24:50] the lands beyond
[24:51] okay now
[24:53] take that statement
[24:54] where you can because of this we can now
[24:57] say any time when brother branham's
[24:58] talking about having the token entered
[25:01] where he says the word token interject
[25:02] the word holy ghost there
[25:04] okay
[25:06] um and we'll skip down a little bit as
[25:08] if the token or the blood in the time of
[25:11] egypt's coming out their exodus if the
[25:13] token
[25:14] was so the supreme sign um skip down um
[25:18] says the token
[25:20] was
[25:21] not no good unless the token was
[25:23] displayed right holy ghost ain't no good
[25:25] unless your holy ghost is displayed
[25:28] right
[25:29] the the holy ghost or the token had to
[25:31] be displayed not a sympathizer with the
[25:34] token
[25:36] but the token must be applied and no
[25:38] matter how much anyone could prove that
[25:40] he was a jew and a covenant jew by
[25:42] circumcision that didn't do anything
[25:44] about it at all it took the token not
[25:47] the covenant he never said when i see
[25:49] the covenant sign
[25:51] but when i see the token so you might be
[25:53] a professed christian you might be
[25:56] be a covenant with christ but unless
[25:59] that token is displayed in this late
[26:01] hour that we're coming to now there's no
[26:04] way for him to pass over the token must
[26:07] be displayed it must be on
[26:11] and so
[26:13] we could say you know we have a
[26:15] relationship with christ we're in the
[26:16] message we we have all sorts of
[26:19] of
[26:20] good teaching we have the message books
[26:22] we read them all the time hey guess what
[26:23] the cell doesn't lose its dna just
[26:25] because a virus comes in
[26:27] right you might have access to the
[26:29] message books but if you're expressing
[26:30] something from the outside and not
[26:32] what's within that word of god when that
[26:35] when god himself comes and visits you
[26:37] you're not going to have
[26:39] the the appropriate word on display
[26:42] right if you've been infected with some
[26:43] sort of seeded discrepancy some some it
[26:46] might look really good it might look 99
[26:48] it might be so tricky you just let it
[26:50] right in but if it's not actually in
[26:53] line with the word that god gave you
[26:55] then you're you're going to express it
[26:57] on the outside eventually right i don't
[26:59] care how long you stuff it down on the
[27:01] inside it's only a matter of time before
[27:03] that virus just so replicates you can't
[27:06] hide it anymore and you'll display it on
[27:08] the outside and when you do
[27:10] right that's it yeah right that your
[27:13] your your token
[27:15] because because the cell in a in its
[27:17] everyday as long as it's expressing what
[27:19] it was intended to do following with the
[27:21] instructions that it had
[27:24] it'll present
[27:25] the word
[27:26] that was given originally
[27:28] right
[27:29] as long as we're following the scripture
[27:31] your life will pattern itself right
[27:33] you'll always be presenting
[27:35] if this is your what you're feeding on
[27:37] right if this is what you're expressing
[27:38] then and that's what you're patterning
[27:40] your life after right because that
[27:42] little cell in its day-to-day functions
[27:44] it's always going back to that word to
[27:45] decide what to do right and your
[27:47] day-to-day functions everything that
[27:48] you're doing
[27:50] you're always going back to the word
[27:51] decide how to conduct your affairs then
[27:53] your out external
[27:56] life
[27:57] will display
[27:58] that seed that you've been you've been
[28:00] expressing
[28:01] the minute that you bring something else
[28:03] in it's only a matter of time before
[28:06] you you express something
[28:08] outside of that before you express
[28:10] something poisonous or toxic you know
[28:12] you want i mean people wonder oh you
[28:14] know everything's going great and then
[28:15] suddenly out of nowhere i blow up and
[28:17] have this crazy fight with my wife and
[28:18] it didn't even make any sense
[28:20] well what have you been feeding on
[28:22] exactly
[28:23] right what was the first thing you did
[28:25] in the morning when you got out of bed
[28:27] you know
[28:28] what what did you do did you you know um
[28:32] did you pick up your phone and read the
[28:34] news
[28:34] and fill your head full of a bunch of
[28:36] like carnal nonsense that the devil put
[28:38] out just to make you depressed and
[28:40] suddenly your day has been kicked off by
[28:42] depression so no wonder you're in a bad
[28:44] mood
[28:45] you know i mean it's simple it seems
[28:47] really simple and small but hey guess
[28:49] what that virus is a tiny little
[28:50] particle it's really simple it's not
[28:52] that complicated but it's something that
[28:54] if you've been if you're if you're
[28:56] not going back to read that word you're
[28:58] not going to express it and anything
[29:00] that you have been in taking in you will
[29:03] express it eventually it's just a matter
[29:05] of time
[29:07] and i am two minutes over so we'll shut
[29:09] it down there
[29:10] and we can stand and have a word of
[29:12] prayer
[29:16] father we thank you for this time that
[29:18] maybe you would take the stumbling of my
[29:20] words father and my
[29:22] foolishness of preaching that these
[29:24] people would might be able to gain
[29:25] something out of it and take something
[29:26] practical that they'd when they roll out
[29:29] of bed tomorrow morning they'd be able
[29:30] to take the fight to the devil a little
[29:32] bit better we ask these things in jesus
[29:33] name amen
