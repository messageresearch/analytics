[27:41] remember the Demar's family,
[27:44] brokenhearted today at the loss of
[27:45] brother Jason's mother.
[27:48] uh that are all up there and um I think
[27:52] Rachel and Amber end up going too as
[27:53] well. Rachel and Amber um kind of
[27:56] shepherded Sister Amy and the whole
[27:58] family and you know in a in a shock
[28:00] condition like that and so they went up
[28:03] and they're flying home. I think they're
[28:05] flying now, aren't they? Hey, Brother
[28:06] Anthony. So, um just want to be praying
[28:09] for their safe return and the Lord will
[28:12] guide. Brother Jason, he's got a

[28:16] next Friday. We'll just see. It's all in
[28:18] the hands of the Lord.
[28:20] Amen. God's not surprised by anything.
[28:23] And uh we want to also remember the
[28:25] Howell family, brother Joe, Brother
[28:27] Josiah headed up to North Carolina uh
[28:30] for his mother who's not doing well,
[28:33] very uh possibly very near death
[28:35] herself. Sister Denise Panetta wrote in
[28:38] um uh Sister Peggy Whitehead. I had put
[28:40] this in the minister's chat the other
[28:42] day when I got it. um she had she had as
[28:47] actually asked that I post it to the
[28:49] whole church and uh and I'll just uh
[28:52] it's not relevant to the request but
[28:54] I'll just take the opportunity just to
[28:56] mention to you so it's out in the open.
[28:58] And I said it and I've said it to a
[28:59] number of people. The churchwide chat um
[29:03] is mainly for announcements or we have
[29:06] used it and will continue to use it for
[29:08] very urgent critical prayer requests for
[29:11] members, active members or their
[29:14] immediate families. And so so you've
[29:17] seen requests come in for just exactly
[29:19] that. Amen. We had a request just
[29:22] recently uh for sister Phyllis that her
[29:25] sister Susie and I spoke to her on the
[29:27] phone and she uh we prayed with her over
[29:30] the phone and she came through the
[29:32] procedure and so we're just looking for
[29:33] the Lord. Lord's already helped her
[29:35] number of times before and so um so I
[29:38] just explained to uh Sister Denise that
[29:41] I would put it in the ministers chat. I
[29:43] can always do that no matter what it is.
[29:45] But we reserve our Bethl tabernacle chat
[29:48] just a little more narrowly than that.
[29:50] Sister Denise was very thankful to know
[29:52] that and understood it perfectly. But
[29:54] her request was Sister Peggy Whitehead
[29:57] and her family are in need of prayer and
[29:59] so it doesn't say specifically what it
[30:02] is. Um but they're needing prayer. I got
[30:04] a a message from brother uh Mike Alttech
[30:07] uh concerning his condition and um he is
[30:11] needing continued prayer. Amen.
[30:14] Believing that the Lord will do that.
[30:16] We've got a um a a prayer cloth we're
[30:19] going to pray over at the end. So,
[30:22] Brother Luther, you don't let me forget
[30:23] that. I've got it here with me. Uh
[30:25] Brother George also wrote in and asked
[30:27] prayer for Traveling Mercy's for he and
[30:29] Sister Andrea and they went up. his
[30:32] father, George Senior, is having a
[30:34] procedure Wednesday. And so, I'm telling
[30:36] you now because it'll be 7:00 a.m. It'll
[30:39] be already over by the time we assemble
[30:41] for our Wednesday night prayer meeting.
[30:43] So, you just remember, put that on your
[30:45] calendar. Amen. And, uh, we want to
[30:47] remember to pray over those needs. Um,
[30:51] especially for Brother George. We love
[30:52] him and, uh, want to see the Lord bring
[30:55] him right through that. Amen. So, a lot
[30:58] to be in prayer about today. And um but
[31:02] the Lord knows all about it. Amen.
[31:04] Praise the name of the Lord. We're going
[31:06] to invite you to the book of Hagi. Just
[31:09] find Malachi and go a couple of books
[31:11] back and you'll run right into him.
[31:13] Amen. Amen.
[31:17] Yeah. Malachi going backwards. Then
[31:20] you'll come all the way through

[32:22] out the order how the Lord wants me to
[32:24] go today. There'll definitely I
[32:26] definitely won't finish. There's numbers
[32:28] of more parts to come. It's a vast
[32:30] subject. Uh but I'm I'm going to try by

[32:36] as I stand here asking him getting some
[32:38] fresh direction. Hagi chapter 2 verse
[32:40] one.
[32:44] In the seventh month, in the 1 and 12th
[32:47] day of the month, came the word of the
[32:50] Lord by the prophet Hagi, saying, "Speak
[32:53] now to Zerubabel, the son of Sheliel,
[32:56] governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the
[32:58] son of Josec, the high priest, and to
[33:01] the residue of the people, saying, Who
[33:04] is left among you that saw this house in
[33:08] her first glory?" So Solomon built it.
[33:11] It was unbelievable. in its grandeur.
[33:15] The Babylonians sacked it and took all
[33:18] of Israel and all of Judah at a later
[33:20] time completely captive. And they had
[33:23] been as according to Jeremiah's prophecy
[33:25] would be in captivity seven year 70
[33:27] years. And so now you have Zerubabel and
[33:31] Joshua the high priest bringing back the
[33:34] first uh returnees for the restoration
[33:38] of of Israel. All right. So this is
[33:41] where we're at. God is asking them, did
[33:43] anybody Is there anybody alive there?
[33:46] You know, there wouldn't be many. Is
[33:48] there anybody alive who saw the very
[33:50] first one Solomon built? And there were
[33:52] there were some alive. Um,
[33:56] who is left among you that saw this
[33:59] house in her first glory? And how do you
[34:02] see it now? Uh, is it not in your eyes
[34:06] in comparison of it as nothing? See, God
[34:09] was discerning their hearts to say,
[34:12] "Gee, you're the restoration's nothing
[34:15] like we had in the original." And see, I
[34:18] I I really am going to take you on a
[34:20] mind bender today. You're going to see
[34:23] because we we we say, "Oh my, I I want
[34:26] to have the days of the early church,
[34:28] and I want to have the apostles and
[34:29] prophets." And you will and you do and
[34:32] you are.
[34:33] But you know a lot of times we can just
[34:35] read the book of Acts or read uh stories
[34:38] in the letters of the apostles and we if
[34:40] we're not careful we'll get it fixed in
[34:42] our mind that it was this clean
[34:44] aniseptic line of story that just they
[34:47] spoke God moved here happened boom boom
[34:50] boom nothing in between nothing to
[34:52] nothing of real life. It's almost like
[34:54] it's not even real life. But those
[34:56] believers lived real life and you're
[34:59] living real life.
[35:01] And God is trying to say to you, don't
[35:03] get it in your mind fixed that this is
[35:06] going to be some smooth, uninterrupted,
[35:09] non-confusing, will absolutely know
[35:12] exactly what to do. The bride has thus
[35:14] sayith the Lord keep. Well, you're going
[35:15] to get a little bit of a mind vendor
[35:17] today. Amen. All right. Watch.
[35:22] So they're thinking of it as nothing.
[35:24] Verse four. Yet now be strong, O
[35:28] Zerubabel. That was going to be
[35:30] necessary,
[35:31] saith the Lord. And be strong, oh
[35:34] Joshua, son of Josec the high priest.
[35:36] And be strong, all ye people of the
[35:38] land, saith the Lord, and work for I am
[35:42] with you.
[35:43] So I I know the world's going crazy, and
[35:46] I know you didn't expect to still be
[35:47] here, but just keep working.
[35:50] Amen. because he's here among us now
[35:54] according to the word I have covenanted
[35:57] with you when you came out of Egypt in
[36:00] other words nothing about my covenant
[36:02] has changed
[36:04] you don't understand everything that's
[36:05] happening but just know this not one of
[36:08] my words has fell to the ground
[36:10] see so my spirit remainth among you fear
[36:15] ye not for thus sayeth the Lord of hosts
[36:18] yet once it is a little while and I will
[36:20] shake the heavens and the earth and the
[36:22] sea and the dry land and I will shake
[36:24] all nations and the desire of all
[36:26] nations shall come and I will fill this
[36:30] house with glory saith the Lord of
[36:33] hosts. The silver is mine and the gold
[36:35] is mine sayeth the Lord of hosts. The
[36:37] glory of this latter house shall be
[36:40] greater than the former sayaeth the Lord
[36:43] of hosts. I mean, you are, you know, you
[36:46] are going to take a rapture.
[36:49] That first age fell short of that.
[36:51] That's never happened. You're a unique
[36:53] age in a unique time as a unique people.
[36:56] You're you're the only age prophesied.
[36:59] Thus sayith the Lord, you're
[37:00] predestinated to not fall.
[37:04] We're going to take a global rapture in
[37:07] one morning. The whole 2,000 years of
[37:10] saints will come up and we shall be
[37:12] changed. Amen.
[37:14] That's never happened.
[37:17] Amen.
[37:18] So the glory of the latter shall be
[37:19] greater. Verse 10.
[37:21] In the four and 20th day of the ninth
[37:23] month, in the second year of Darius came
[37:24] the word of the Lord to h by Hagi the
[37:26] prophet, saying, Thus sayeth the Lord of
[37:28] hosts, ask now the priest concerning the
[37:30] law, saying, now listen close.
[37:33] This is a principle of the end time.
[37:35] Because what I haven't told you yet,
[37:37] I've said it in other sermons. This is
[37:40] the seventh month. This is the time of
[37:41] the of the feast of tabernacles.
[37:44] They This is the feast of trumpets,
[37:46] feast of atonements, feast of
[37:47] tabernacles. It's all coming. The the
[37:50] feast of trumpets start on the first day
[37:52] of that seventh month. The 10th day, the
[37:55] feast of atonement. The 15th day, the
[37:56] feast of tabernacles. And that runs
[37:58] seven days. And then after that is the
[38:00] eighth day, the rest. Because we're in a
[38:02] millennium by then.
[38:03] Right now, you're at the time of the
[38:05] body change. Oh my goodness.
[38:07] You have arrived, friends. Scripture
[38:09] can't fail. We have arrived.
[38:12] Amen.
[38:13] So now everything we're reading should
[38:16] be relevant to you right now.
[38:19] Amen.
[38:22] Verse 11 again. Thus sayith the Lord of
[38:24] hosts, ask now the priest concerning the
[38:26] law, saying, If one bear holy flesh, and
[38:29] the skirt of his garment,
[38:32] and with his skirt do touch bread or
[38:36] pottage or wine or oil or any meat,
[38:40] shall it be holy? In other words,
[38:42] whatever it touched, shall it be holy?
[38:44] And the priest answered and said, "No."
[38:48] And that they were right. See,
[38:51] so it's not about, this is why we say to
[38:54] young men and young women, don't
[38:56] associate yourself with unbelievers. You
[38:58] wait till somebody's born of the Holy
[39:00] Spirit because you being around them
[39:03] won't cleanse them.
[39:05] What'll end up happening is they'll drag
[39:06] you down. Maybe not on purpose, but
[39:09] they're not born again.
[39:12] So you wait on God.
[39:14] See?
[39:15] Amen. Then said Hagi, if one that is
[39:18] unclean by a dead body uh if one that is
[39:22] unclean by a by a dead body touch any of
[39:26] these shall it be unclean? And the
[39:28] priest answered and said it shall be
[39:30] unclean. So it when you are associated
[39:34] with an unbeliever because light hath no
[39:36] fellowship with darkness then you become
[39:38] unclean in that association.
[39:42] Amen. Now, I'm telling you, this has its
[39:45] most prominent hour right now in time of
[39:47] the Feast of Tabernacles.
[39:48] Amen.
[39:50] Don't be fooled at the la Don't get
[39:52] fooled here at the finish line. Goodness
[39:54] gracious.
[39:55] You young people, you've been raised in
[39:56] a good home. Don't get fooled right here
[39:59] at the finish line.
[40:00] Amen.
[40:03] So, I I want them to be saved. Great.
[40:05] That's awesome. That's a wonderful thing
[40:06] to want. But stay in prayer and wait on
[40:09] God.
[40:10] All you're going to do is run
[40:11] interference on God and get in God's
[40:13] way.
[40:14] I have seen that happen too many times.
[40:16] Then answered Hagi and said, "So is this
[40:19] people, and so is this nation before me,
[40:21] saith the Lord, and so is every work of
[40:24] their hands, and that which they offer
[40:26] there is unclean." See, they were they
[40:29] were they were unclean, trying to come
[40:30] around God. Oh my. And now I pray you
[40:33] consider from this day and upward from
[40:36] before the stone was laid upon a stone
[40:38] in the temple of the Lord since those
[40:39] days were when one came to an heap of 20
[40:44] measures there were but 10. When one
[40:47] came to the to the press fat for to draw
[40:50] out 50 vessels out of the press there
[40:53] were but 20. So he's he's reminding them
[40:58] the whole reason we went into captivity
[41:01] was because of sin and ungodliness.
[41:03] And do you remember you you old-timers,
[41:06] you remember how that he's saying to
[41:08] those Israelites, you remember back then
[41:10] you you'd go to get 20, you only got
[41:12] half of everything. Why? Because it was
[41:14] God plagging us,
[41:18] correcting us,
[41:20] disciplining us, and we were we weren't
[41:23] catching the message. Amen.
[41:26] And he said,
[41:27] "I smoke you with blasting and with
[41:31] mildew." Said, "I thought the devil did
[41:32] that to me." No, the Lord did it.
[41:35] I smoke you with blasting and with
[41:37] mildew and with hail in all the labors
[41:41] of your hands, yet you turned not to me,
[41:43] sayeth the Lord. Consider now from this
[41:46] day and upward, from the four and 20th
[41:48] day of the ninth month, even from the
[41:50] day that the foundation of the Lord's
[41:53] temple was laid, consider it.
[41:56] Is the seed yet in the barn? Yay. Now
[42:00] he's Now he's got them back. Now there's
[42:02] been a restoration. Now they've laid the
[42:04] foundation of the temple. Now God is
[42:07] starting to bless it again. And he's
[42:09] saying they're saying, "Oh, but it's
[42:11] nothing like the original." He's saying,
[42:12] "Hey, are your barns full?"
[42:15] It was no time ago you were a prisoner
[42:17] in Babylon.
[42:18] Yeah.
[42:19] See, is the seed yet in the barn? Yay.
[42:22] As yet the vine and the fig tree and the
[42:24] pomegranate and the olive tree hath not
[42:26] brought forth. From this day will I
[42:30] bless you.
[42:31] Amen.
[42:32] From this day. Now you're restored. Now
[42:36] I will bless you. May the Lord bless the
[42:40] reading of his word. You can have your
[42:41] seats. I'm going to continue reading
[42:43] these last three verses. So, please keep
[42:46] that on the screen for me, Eth.
[42:48] And again the word of the Lord came unto
[42:50] Hagi in the 4 and 20th day of the month,
[42:53] saying, now watch,
[42:57] speak to Zerubabel,
[42:59] governor of Judah, saying, I will shake
[43:03] heavens and the earth, and I will
[43:05] overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I
[43:08] will destroy the strength of the
[43:10] kingdoms of the heathen. Now, you're
[43:12] reading about the tribulation period
[43:15] after this bride is gone. He's going to
[43:17] shake everything to pieces and destroy
[43:19] kingdoms and nations. See there when you
[43:22] when you read this second chapter of
[43:25] Hagi, he spends the first eight verses
[43:29] in a sec in a section, you know, talking
[43:32] about the restoration of the temple and
[43:34] the lives of the people and the Israel
[43:37] as a nation and we've come back and then
[43:39] then he divides. He starts from the
[43:41] ninth verse going. It almost sounds like
[43:42] a some historians think maybe it's a
[43:44] different writer because it's like
[43:46] dealing it's like wow he took a
[43:47] millennial leap.
[43:49] And so now here he is again and he's
[43:52] went all the way from the time of
[43:54] restoration under Zerubabel and followed
[43:58] by Ezra followed by Nehemiah and now
[44:00] he's he's sent it all the way past
[44:03] Jesus. Remember they asked Jesus on the
[44:06] Mount of Olives, are you now going to
[44:08] fulfill this?
[44:09] Amen. are you now going to restore the
[44:11] kingdom you promised you would?
[44:14] Is this the time? And Jesus is basically
[44:16] saying to them, you know, don't worry
[44:18] about that.
[44:20] Just go serve me. I got a plan.
[44:22] Amen.
[44:23] Uh this is in the father's hands. I just
[44:26] need you to be loyal Christians
[44:29] and serve God and don't doubt the word
[44:33] and just keep going forward. All right.
[44:37] So he says, um, I will overthrow, verse
[44:39] 22, and I will overthrow the throne of
[44:41] kingdoms, and I will destroy the
[44:43] strength of the kingdoms of the heathen,
[44:45] and I will overthrow the chariots and
[44:47] those that ride in them, and the horses,
[44:48] and the riders shall come down every one
[44:50] by the sword of his brother. In that
[44:53] day, saith the Lord of hosts, will I
[44:56] take thee, O Zerubabel, my servant, the
[44:58] son of Sheliel, saith the Lord, and will
[45:01] make thee as a signant, for I have
[45:04] chosen thee, sayeth the Lord of hosts.
[45:07] So, a signate is your identification.
[45:09] It's a it's often a built, you know,
[45:12] molded into clay or something like that.
[45:14] And it was worn in a ring. And every
[45:17] every chieftain, every leader, every
[45:19] rich man had a signant ring so that when
[45:23] there was a document and he put his
[45:26] signate and put it there, you would know
[45:28] that it's verified. It's authentic. It's
[45:31] got his seal. You understand? And so,
[45:34] so, so now he's saying, and by that
[45:37] seal, then you're able to identify that
[45:41] it's Christ.
[45:42] Amen. Because Zerubable here now is in
[45:45] is in the type of Christ. He's a
[45:47] signant. And that's what Jesus was.
[45:50] He was the God's signant ring. And so
[45:53] today when we have a message that comes
[45:55] our way and we say to the world, "This
[45:58] is the true message." And they say, "How
[46:00] do you know?" Because it has the seal of
[46:03] the Holy Ghost.
[46:04] How do you know you're a Christian? Cuz
[46:06] I have a seal of the Holy Ghost.
[46:08] And I'm no longer identified as Jason
[46:11] Watkins. not actually the son of Ed and
[46:13] Jean Watkins. There was another Jason
[46:15] Watkins down on the inside.
[46:18] And I'm identified in Christ.
[46:21] Amen.
[46:22] See, I'm part of the beloved.
[46:24] Hallelujah.
[46:26] So, this is where we have come to. We
[46:29] can see in the prophecy here in Hagi
[46:32] chapter 2. And I and and and I and I I
[46:35] don't want to keep reading. There's a
[46:37] lot more that I that I could go back and
[46:39] have read even in chapter one. But but
[46:42] and even in in Zephaniah prior and
[46:44] Zechariah following it, it's all
[46:46] happening right together. You remember
[46:48] that it's in Zechariah 3 where where
[46:53] where the where Zerubabel's
[46:57] brother
[46:58] uh fellow brother, fellow Israelite is
[47:02] Joshua, the high priest. And you
[47:05] remember he's standing, he's called into
[47:09] uh a court trial. He's called into the
[47:12] presence of God. And the Bible says
[47:13] there in Zechariah 3, I preached on it
[47:15] before that that's the time that Joshua,
[47:17] the high priest, stood before uh the the
[47:20] judge seated on the throne according to
[47:21] Daniel 7. He's seated.
[47:23] Yeah.
[47:23] And and this is the time of the
[47:25] judgment. This is all interplaying with
[47:26] the time of the great judgment. And when
[47:28] he comes before him, Satan's there to
[47:30] accuse him. And remember that that
[47:33] Joshua was in the position not for
[47:35] himself.
[47:37] He was in the position of high priest
[47:40] because God wasn't going to bring all of
[47:42] Israel into the judgment. He only needed
[47:44] to bring the high priest because the
[47:45] high priest represented the whole
[47:47] family.
[47:48] Oh, hallelujah. That's why we have a
[47:50] high priest. Hallelujah. That represents
[47:52] all of us.
[47:54] I don't have to go stand in the
[47:55] judgment. Jesus already went there and
[47:58] stood it for me.
[47:59] Amen. and therefore my sins have went
[48:02] before me. Some men's sins go before
[48:04] them under judgment. Some men's sins
[48:06] follow them under judgment. You don't
[48:08] want to be the one that they follow
[48:10] because then you got to give an account
[48:11] for all your evil deeds. But if they go
[48:13] before you, by the time you arrive, it's
[48:16] already judged. You're you're take your
[48:18] seat on the throne and there's never
[48:20] mentioned again.
[48:22] Hallelujah.
[48:23] Amen.
[48:26] So this this is what all is happening.
[48:29] So I I think I've successfully captured
[48:31] your mind that you're reading prophecy
[48:33] of your day.
[48:35] These things are relative to you and I.
[48:39] It's a whole reason that I made the
[48:42] comments about unclean associated with
[48:44] clean
[48:45] and one contaminates the other, not the
[48:47] other way around. See,
[48:49] so we find then that
[48:53] you know he there's prophecy between
[48:56] Zephaniah and Hagi and Zachchariah and
[48:59] you get a prophecy concerning Gog and we
[49:02] realize that of course it's it's not in
[49:04] that case it's a prince. It's not the
[49:07] land not that valley of Megiddo although
[49:09] that's where it's going to take place
[49:10] that's going to be Armageddon and uh the
[49:13] va the battle of Gog and Magog takes
[49:16] place in the same area.
[49:17] Amen. thousand years apart. But this is
[49:20] concerning the prince Gog. That's why
[49:22] it's the land of Gog because he was a
[49:25] prince and he's typical. He's being
[49:27] typed as the Antichrist. It's it's
[49:29] Lucifer. All right? And so, so he's
[49:33] saying that at the time where Gog is
[49:37] ruling the world, that's the time I'm
[49:41] going to shake heavens and earth.
[49:44] Amen.
[49:45] And I'm going to take him down. this
[49:47] enemy of God that has been an enemy of
[49:50] God since before the earth because the
[49:53] war that came into the earth spilled
[49:55] over from heaven that Michael and his
[49:57] angels fought against Lucifer and his
[49:59] angels and they were cast out and that
[50:01] battle came down into the earth and
[50:02] you're fighting it still.
[50:04] Amen.
[50:06] So this is the time when it all comes to
[50:08] a head and it all comes to a a climax.
[50:13] The world is filled with uncertainty and
[50:16] we must be able you know that that what
[50:20] power are we promised? We talk about the
[50:22] third pole and the power of the spoken
[50:24] word
[50:26] and that's not uh how would I say it?
[50:30] That's not novel. That's not new.
[50:33] Amen.
[50:35] Abraham all the way back to Genesis
[50:39] was operating the third pole. show you
[50:42] that here in a minute. Had to be because
[50:44] it has to be from Genesis to Revelation.
[50:46] Amen.
[50:46] That's why brother Brandham showed us
[50:48] that that the seventh seal what when
[50:52] brother Brandham first thought early on
[50:55] all the way up till the time
[50:57] he thought it in in uh Cersis the time.
[51:01] He thought it all the way when he's in
[51:03] the desert.
[51:04] He thought it when he's headed back to
[51:05] preach the seals. He thought it even
[51:08] through the first seal.
[51:09] Amen. He's still thinking it takes all
[51:11] the way till three nights later till the
[51:13] fourth seal to where we don't think it
[51:14] anymore
[51:15] because it was progressive even to a
[51:17] prophet. It's got to be progressive to
[51:18] you and I.
[51:20] And he actually thought that the seven
[51:22] thunder mystery was something different
[51:23] than the seven seals. And it was on the
[51:25] outside of the Bible, not even written
[51:26] in the Bible. Uh-huh.
[51:28] Amen.
[51:29] Now, we wouldn't have known that except
[51:31] he was humble and honest enough in 1965
[51:34] in spiritual food in due season to admit
[51:37] it openly
[51:39] and say, you know, I used to teach and I
[51:41] thought that it was something outside of
[51:43] the word all the way up to the desert
[51:45] and all the way into the beginning of
[51:46] the seals. I thought that it was
[51:48] something outside and something extra.
[51:50] And that's what the seven thunders camp
[51:52] from the 70s cabbaged on.
[51:54] They took those quotes and said, "See,
[51:55] it's something different. ignoring the
[51:57] fact
[51:58] right
[51:59] that he said no it can't be anything
[52:01] outside of the word it's got to be
[52:03] inside the word
[52:05] therefore the the seven thunder mystery
[52:07] that's why a prophet does two things one
[52:10] according to Malachi 4 he restores the
[52:13] faith of the children back to the faith
[52:14] of the original fathers and number two
[52:17] under revelation 10 he is to bring the
[52:20] mystery of the seven thunders which are
[52:22] contained in the seven seals
[52:25] amen Amen.
[52:26] Amen.
[52:27] Amen.
[52:27] See, so the seven thunders are the
[52:30] mystery of God revealed.
[52:32] Amen.
[52:33] They're not something additional,
[52:34] something later, some extra revelation
[52:36] that needed an eighth messenger, needed
[52:39] some super preacher with a super camp
[52:41] and a and a super speak
[52:43] who could use fancy cliches and use
[52:46] language to confuse everybody.
[52:49] I'm glad we had a hillbilly to bring us
[52:51] the seven thunders
[52:54] because I can see it's everything that
[52:56] Paul had and everything that has been
[52:58] restored to you. You ought to thank God.
[53:01] Hallelujah. Because it is those seven
[53:04] mysteries that the thunder spoke. That's
[53:06] what is giving you rapturing faith for a
[53:09] body change.
[53:11] Without it, you have no way to get that
[53:13] faith.
[53:14] Right.
[53:20] So we find that this power in the word
[53:23] we call it, brother Brandham termed it a
[53:25] third pull because
[53:28] the message of restoration that came to
[53:30] him came in three phases
[53:32] or what he called three poles and the
[53:35] first was a sign in the hand and it
[53:38] operated.
[53:39] The second was you'd know the secrets of
[53:41] the heart and it operated. The third was
[53:44] the power of the spoken word.
[53:47] He talked about creating squirrels. He
[53:49] talked about, you know, resurrecting a a
[53:52] fish.
[53:53] He he he talked about a tumor on his
[53:55] wife that he spoke it at distance.
[53:57] Amen.
[53:58] Spoke it at distance.
[54:00] And said, "Here's how to be, but she'll
[54:03] go to the doctor."
[54:05] But before he touches her, it'll
[54:07] evaporate. And she climbed on the table
[54:09] with it still there. Oh yes.
[54:12] And as the doctor walked in the door,
[54:14] it's still there.
[54:15] And as he walked over to place his hands
[54:17] on it, it's still there until it ain't.
[54:22] And now he's searching for something.
[54:24] He's not going to find it cuz it doesn't
[54:26] exist anymore.
[54:28] He has taken it out of existence. That's
[54:30] what he did to your sin. He took it out
[54:32] of existence.
[54:34] And the devil can search till the till
[54:36] the till the world ends. You'll never
[54:38] find it because it's in the sea of God's
[54:41] ex, God's non-existence,
[54:44] God's complete forgetfulness.
[54:47] Glory.
[54:48] Thank you, Lord.
[54:49] Amen.
[54:51] Thank you, Jesus.
[54:54] So, the world filled with such
[54:55] uncertainty and we must be able with
[54:58] certainty to operate this spoken word
[55:00] power, this third pull power and that
[55:02] begins with hearing the voice of the
[55:05] Lord very clearly.
[55:08] So then my theme has been
[55:11] dedication and consecration
[55:15] because I'm not here to wow you with
[55:17] super speak.
[55:20] I'm not here just to get rah rah rah.
[55:23] We're going to have all kinds of power.
[55:25] H how about all kinds of dedication
[55:28] because you're never going to get the
[55:30] you're never going to get the power of
[55:31] God. The power of God works by the word
[55:33] of God. And how are you going to have
[55:34] faith if you don't even hear it? And
[55:36] you're never going to hear it if your if
[55:38] your flues are all stopped up with
[55:39] leodysa. How you going to hear it?
[55:43] See,
[55:44] say, "Well, will I need it?" Oh, buddy.
[55:47] You're needing it now.
[55:50] Amen.
[55:50] You're needing it right now. Right now,
[55:52] we're in the most critical junction of
[55:54] human history.
[55:56] And it's only going to get worse. We've
[55:58] got to see
[56:01] that it it takes dedication and
[56:03] consecration. And we've also got to see,
[56:05] and I just want to make these statements
[56:07] to you as I felt inspired.
[56:10] We've got to see that it's not going to
[56:12] work like we think.
[56:15] Wow.
[56:16] And this is what the experience of
[56:18] Brother Brandham was. There's there's no
[56:21] need for you to expect it to be any
[56:24] different. Brother Brandham was
[56:26] constantly when he was there, you know,
[56:29] and I would I would advise you to go and
[56:31] catch the sermon as I was with Moses and
[56:33] different ones where he tells this story
[56:37] of he's in the woods and that happened
[56:39] twice, by the way. Created squirrels
[56:40] twice.
[56:41] Amen.
[56:42] And uh, Brother Charlie Cox had those in
[56:45] his freezer. They ate the first batch of
[56:48] them of them. And brother Charlie
[56:50] testified none of them had a navl.
[56:52] Yeah. Amen.
[56:53] Amen.
[56:54] Not one of them had no belly button.
[56:58] They weren't born through that method.
[57:00] They were spoken into creation.
[57:03] And a and a prophet, I mean, you know,
[57:05] he was constantly having to double back.
[57:07] And he was he was what we would call the
[57:10] father of our third pull. See? And so,
[57:13] so he, you know, he's got points where,
[57:16] and I, and I might repeat myself a
[57:18] little bit later in this sermon or in
[57:19] other sermons, but it's it's so amazing
[57:22] everywhere I'm going and looking at the
[57:24] fish and the bear and and and I and I
[57:26] dealt with the the caribou and the the
[57:29] the silver tip the other time, and I
[57:31] want to talk about uh the the boy where
[57:33] brother Brandham, they the plane gets
[57:36] grounded there at Memphis, I think.
[57:38] And he comes down and he said, "Here's
[57:40] an
[57:40] anchamima,
[57:41] you know, with such respect, you know,
[57:44] such respect." And he said, "She was
[57:46] beautiful."
[57:47] That's what he said. Big old fat cheeks.
[57:49] He said, "A man's shirt tied around her
[57:51] head just like you would imagine in the
[57:52] in the Norman Rockwell picture." And he
[57:55] said, "She was beautiful to me because
[57:57] she was a Christian and she glowed."
[58:01] And he's walking by whistling, "I'm one
[58:03] of them." He just learned it.
[58:05] It was an old Pentecostal tune. He said,
[58:07] "I just learned it and I was going down
[58:08] the road whistling. I'm one of them. I'm
[58:10] so glad that I can say." And he said, "I
[58:11] saw her out leaning out over the fence."
[58:13] He said, "I felt quiet, started I was
[58:14] going to walk on by." And he says, "I
[58:15] walk on by." She said, "Morning,
[58:17] Parson." And he said, "Whoa, wait a
[58:19] minute. How'd you know I was a
[58:20] preacher?" And he spun around. "How'd
[58:22] you know I was a preacher?" "Oh, I I
[58:23] know you was coming."
[58:25] I've been out here since before
[58:26] daylight. I know you was coming. But
[58:28] you're supposed to have a briefcase.
[58:29] Well, I left it in the room. That didn't
[58:31] stop the It didn't stop it.
[58:34] It didn't stop it. Brother Brandham has
[58:36] taken off completely taken off guard.
[58:38] You're like, "What in the world's going
[58:39] on?" He gets in there to pray. He don't
[58:42] even know what to He says, "I just said,
[58:44] Lord, I I don't even know why. I mean, I
[58:47] was just walking, you know, and and here
[58:49] she says to me, and I'm in here, and I'm
[58:51] praying for this boy, and that's all I
[58:52] know to do." You know, it it wasn't so
[58:55] clear. That's my point I'm trying to
[58:57] make.
[58:58] It was all and and he had been walking
[59:00] in a vision for hours, even the pre the
[59:02] previous day.
[59:04] When a plane gets grounded, Yeah.
[59:07] And you you know, you've got pilots and
[59:09] air traffic control and airlines trying
[59:11] not to let that be delayed or canled,
[59:13] but they can't stop it
[59:14] because God grounded that plane. Why?
[59:17] Cuz a woman was praying.
[59:18] Amen.
[59:19] Over a big strapping 6- foot tall baby
[59:23] boy.
[59:24] Hallelujah.
[59:26] And and the prophet here he is walking
[59:28] in the vision. He said, "I sit up that
[59:29] night." Well, what I do with myself is
[59:31] I'm not usually here. So he said, 'I
[59:32] just sit up till late writing letters
[59:34] and and thinking catching up on things,
[59:36] just just killing time with what time he
[59:38] had, trying to be productive.
[59:40] So no wonder he didn't take his
[59:42] briefcase because he was just going to
[59:44] run down and put him in the box.
[59:46] Yeah.
[59:47] And well, he got jumped by the Holy
[59:49] Spirit as soon as he put him in the box.
[59:50] And the and the Lord said, "Keep
[59:52] walking."
[59:53] Huh?
[59:55] Keep walking.
[59:57] Okay.
[1:00:00] Oh, what now? Keep walking.
[1:00:03] Okay. Well, maybe that was just me.
[1:00:07] And this is a prophet. What do you think
[1:00:09] you're going to face?
[1:00:10] Oh, yeah.
[1:00:11] See,
[1:00:12] but you know what? His insurance policy
[1:00:13] was dedication.
[1:00:18] Consecration.
[1:00:20] That was his insurance policy.
[1:00:22] He couldn't take a wrong step if he'd
[1:00:24] had tried.
[1:00:25] He left a briefcase that she saw in a
[1:00:27] dream. That didn't matter. You think God
[1:00:28] didn't know he would leave it yet? He
[1:00:30] she still saw it in a dream.
[1:00:31] And when those dreams come to pass,
[1:00:33] that's like a vision.
[1:00:35] See, and so when it's a spiritual dream,
[1:00:38] and so he he's like, "Maybe, oh well, I
[1:00:42] got to catch a plane. They told me to be
[1:00:44] right back at the gate this morning. I
[1:00:45] can't miss it twice."
[1:00:47] And so he kind of walks over to a corner
[1:00:49] and he said, "There's a fishing store
[1:00:51] there." He said, "I love fishing." And
[1:00:52] so he said, "I went in there and he
[1:00:54] said, I was kind of looking at the at
[1:00:56] the bait, looking around
[1:00:58] you know, looking at this and he says
[1:00:59] the big old Irish cops stand and he's
[1:01:01] trying to watch me and I'm you know I
[1:01:03] don't want him to I don't want to draw
[1:01:04] attention. Lord, Lord, was that you? Was
[1:01:07] that you talking to me a while ago? Was
[1:01:10] that you, Lord? And the Lord said, I
[1:01:12] told you keep walking.
[1:01:16] Amen.
[1:01:16] And when you hear Brother Bram say it on
[1:01:17] the tape, he inflects it just like that.
[1:01:19] Almost like the Holy Spirit is like,
[1:01:20] "What are you doing looking at fishing
[1:01:22] lures? What are you doing in the store
[1:01:24] worried about a cop? I told you to keep
[1:01:26] walking. You wouldn't have got in this
[1:01:28] spot if you'd have just listened to what
[1:01:29] I said.
[1:01:32] Now, that's a prophet. Where do you
[1:01:33] think you're going to stand, friends?
[1:01:37] And he's walking and he's walking and
[1:01:38] he's walking and he's walking and he
[1:01:40] says, "Well, that plane's going to be
[1:01:41] gone for sure now. I' I've missed it."
[1:01:43] But it it goes to show that he was not
[1:01:46] about to put anything ahead. He was
[1:01:48] seeking the kingdom of God first.
[1:01:51] And that's what Jesus said to do. seek
[1:01:53] you the kingdom of heaven first. Your
[1:01:56] father knows what you need. He'll add
[1:01:57] these things to you. If you go chase
[1:01:59] them yourself, they might be good, bad,
[1:02:01] they might blow up in your face. You
[1:02:03] never know what it's going to be. It's
[1:02:04] just rolling the dice when you're trying
[1:02:06] to figure out your own life.
[1:02:09] You're crazy to do that when you've got
[1:02:11] a heavenly father who's willing to lead
[1:02:14] you and guide you into all truth.
[1:02:16] All he needs is you to be in
[1:02:18] consecration and dedication. You already
[1:02:20] got a gene. You already got faith.
[1:02:22] You're already the you're already a
[1:02:23] believer. What else you need?
[1:02:25] You just need consecration.
[1:02:28] Amen.
[1:02:29] And that is so vital. That's the real
[1:02:30] burden of my heart on this whole series
[1:02:32] that we have arrived at the time,
[1:02:34] friends, where dedication and
[1:02:35] consecration are paramount.
[1:02:37] Amen.
[1:02:38] That's right.
[1:02:39] Amen.
[1:02:40] And there's where he goes on down.
[1:02:44] So,
[1:02:46] you know, and he he experienced some of
[1:02:47] the same things in the woods. And the
[1:02:50] Lord said, you know, just struck up a
[1:02:51] conversation. Lord just struck up a
[1:02:54] conversation. What are you doing?
[1:02:56] Hunting squirrel.
[1:02:58] How many you need? Three. Say where
[1:03:00] they'll be.
[1:03:03] Okay.
[1:03:04] Want to be right over there and want to
[1:03:07] be right there and want to be right over
[1:03:09] here.
[1:03:12] Nothing.
[1:03:14] And is he insane? He's talking to
[1:03:16] himself in the woods. He's talking. He's
[1:03:18] hearing a voice. And he said, "I kept
[1:03:19] hearing him speak." He said, "I kept
[1:03:20] looking around." He said, "Usually I see
[1:03:22] that light." He said, "I didn't see them
[1:03:24] anywhere." Where are you at? Where? And
[1:03:25] he said, "It's hear a voice out of the
[1:03:27] atmosphere. Say where they'll be." Okay.
[1:03:29] Right there. Right there. I'm right
[1:03:30] there. And then he said, "Okay." So he
[1:03:32] just said, "Okay, okay. Okay." and he's
[1:03:35] leaned back and he's waiting and he
[1:03:36] said, 'I waited and I waited
[1:03:40] and I waited and it was getting dark and
[1:03:44] I thought, wow, that must have just been
[1:03:47] me. Okay, how ridiculous. I'm going home
[1:03:51] now, you know. And he he's walking out
[1:03:53] of the holler and that voice starts
[1:03:55] talking. Hey,
[1:03:59] you you said they would be there.
[1:04:02] Come back. Well, but I I they're they're
[1:04:05] not there and it's getting dark. But you
[1:04:07] already said it.
[1:04:09] You already spoke it. It can't you can't
[1:04:11] change it now because that was me. You
[1:04:15] were speaking my words and nothing could
[1:04:17] reverse it.
[1:04:18] Hallelujah.
[1:04:21] See, and so he's coming back and he and
[1:04:24] that whole story, I don't want to get
[1:04:26] bogged down into it today because I plan
[1:04:28] to hit some more highlights of it. Uh
[1:04:30] kind of like we did the caribou and the
[1:04:32] bear. But but my I'm only making this
[1:04:35] point that from that moment, Brother
[1:04:37] Brandon was put through so much anxiety.
[1:04:39] It's a wonder he didn't have a nervous
[1:04:41] breakdown
[1:04:43] because getting those three squirrels
[1:04:45] was maddening
[1:04:47] and then he couldn't find one. And then
[1:04:49] somebody thinks he's lying and then he's
[1:04:50] under stress and now he's hurt. It hurt
[1:04:52] his feelings. He's just a human.
[1:04:56] You understand friends? And this is the
[1:04:58] third pole working. Right.
[1:05:01] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:04] When I read these passages
[1:05:08] in Haggi, I realize that the world is
[1:05:11] becoming worse than we imagined.
[1:05:14] Yeah.
[1:05:14] I mean, this is why we're you read, I'm
[1:05:18] going to shake heavens and earth, and
[1:05:20] I'm going to topple kings, and I'm going
[1:05:21] to just destroy everything.
[1:05:24] I'm going to go after Gog and I'm going
[1:05:26] to wipe him out, my archeneemy.
[1:05:29] And I've allowed him to live this long.
[1:05:32] And he's he's been a puppet for me,
[1:05:35] helping me perfect my family and get
[1:05:37] every name that was on that book. But
[1:05:40] I'm done with him now. I've got my
[1:05:41] family.
[1:05:43] She has believed my word. I got my
[1:05:46] 144,000. I got my bride in heaven. I got
[1:05:49] my Old Testament bride. I got everybody.
[1:05:51] I'm ready to go forward. I'm going to go
[1:05:53] after him and wipe him out.
[1:05:57] So, the world when I read all of that, I
[1:06:00] can see that the world is becoming worse
[1:06:02] than we imagined.
[1:06:05] And with the exponential rate that it's
[1:06:07] collapsing, I see it getting much worse
[1:06:10] than it is now. You hear me?
[1:06:13] You hear you? If you consider me your
[1:06:14] shepherd, you take my word for it and
[1:06:16] you'll go, you'll come back and remember
[1:06:18] what I said to you on this day.
[1:06:21] I see it by the help of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:23] looking into the Bible and looking at
[1:06:25] things that have to come. I see it
[1:06:26] getting much worse
[1:06:29] than it is now. And I see it happening
[1:06:30] quickly,
[1:06:34] much worse. So, here's your warning now.
[1:06:37] All of you who are, you know, thank God
[1:06:41] it it's it's few and getting fewer. I
[1:06:45] think the word is having an effect on
[1:06:47] you. Amen.
[1:06:48] But I want to say if there's anybody
[1:06:50] still in a in a state of non-committal,
[1:06:53] become committed.
[1:06:56] If you've if you've allowed your mind to
[1:06:58] go into crazy nonsense and thinking
[1:07:01] crazy, repent of your craziness.
[1:07:06] I say that to this audience and to those
[1:07:08] listening on the stream. Even people who
[1:07:10] are opposed to me who listen on the
[1:07:11] stream, let me look into the camera.
[1:07:13] Repent of your craziness.
[1:07:16] It's not too late.
[1:07:19] This thing ain't over.
[1:07:22] Hallelujah.
[1:07:24] Amen.
[1:07:27] And dilator trifling preachers and
[1:07:30] pastors. And I have to raise both my
[1:07:31] hands on that one. I just say, "Lord
[1:07:33] God, I'm repenting today. I'm done with
[1:07:36] being dilatory and trifling. I want to
[1:07:38] be a soldier on the front lines. I want
[1:07:41] to be vigilant and fervent and I want to
[1:07:43] have zeal of the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:46] So if you're mad for what I said and
[1:07:48] maybe it's at you well I also including
[1:07:50] myself. So we're all in the pot
[1:07:52] together. We all need to repent.
[1:07:56] But I want to say to you to this to this
[1:07:57] today to you today.
[1:08:00] Yes, the world is going crazy. Yes, it's
[1:08:02] getting much worse. Yes, it's going to
[1:08:04] get much worse. But I want to say to
[1:08:07] you, forget what's happening in the
[1:08:11] world. Because the Bible is only telling
[1:08:14] the world what it's going to do to them.
[1:08:16] But the Bible is speaking to God's
[1:08:18] family. And it's saying to you, I will
[1:08:21] begin to bless you. You have come into a
[1:08:24] season at the end of it all, and you're
[1:08:26] going to be elevated, and you're going
[1:08:27] to be blessed. And I'm not talking about
[1:08:29] adding zeros to your bank account. I'm
[1:08:31] talking about uh being rich in the love
[1:08:34] of God and rich in faith and rich in
[1:08:37] power.
[1:08:39] Hallelujah.
[1:08:42] Blessing is not only monetary. It's
[1:08:43] everything that pertains to life.
[1:08:47] We prove that to you last service that
[1:08:49] the joy of the Lord is something you
[1:08:52] acquire. It's a victory. It's a you it's
[1:08:54] it's something you've earned because the
[1:08:57] joy of the Lord is something
[1:08:58] supernatural. You can't get there. It
[1:09:00] doesn't require happiness.
[1:09:03] Doesn't require even blessing.
[1:09:05] Not at all. As I said to you Wednesday,
[1:09:08] it doesn't require any of that. It's a
[1:09:10] supernatural thing God does. And it is
[1:09:12] your strength.
[1:09:14] The joy of the Lord is your strength.
[1:09:17] But how were they told in Nehemiah?
[1:09:19] Because of repentance. Because of
[1:09:21] dedication. There we go again. Because
[1:09:24] of consecration. See,
[1:09:27] so we are as Peter says here in second
[1:09:30] Peter 1:3, E second Peter 1:3,
[1:09:33] according I love this because I I'm
[1:09:36] saying to you that blessing is not just
[1:09:38] monetary. It's everything that pertains
[1:09:39] to life. Look at what Simon Peter says.
[1:09:42] Second Peter chapter 1 verse three.
[1:09:44] according as his divine power hath given
[1:09:47] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:09:51] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:09:54] of him that hath called us to glory and
[1:09:57] virtue.
[1:09:58] Amen.
[1:09:59] Amen.
[1:10:00] It's not about shiny new cars in your
[1:10:03] garage.
[1:10:03] Amen.
[1:10:04] It's things that really matter.
[1:10:06] See,
[1:10:08] so life and godliness. So, we're called
[1:10:12] to glory and virtue. And it's his glory,
[1:10:14] not yours.
[1:10:16] It's by his strength, not yours.
[1:10:19] Oh, we are to rejoice in that to say
[1:10:21] it's his glory and it's by his strength
[1:10:23] and I'm just here to be a surrendered
[1:10:25] vessel.
[1:10:27] Amen.
[1:10:29] As the world is plunging into madness
[1:10:31] and Gog, the Antichrist spirit gaining
[1:10:33] epic power to control the earth. And
[1:10:36] it's at that time, it's at that time
[1:10:40] that he says, "Now from this day, I will
[1:10:44] begin to bless you."
[1:10:48] See, that's the promise of restoration.
[1:10:52] So,
[1:10:54] you know, as we were saying, Zerubel,
[1:10:57] you know, he was owned as the Lord's
[1:10:59] signant ring. And there's where brother
[1:11:02] Brandham went back to in the in the
[1:11:04] seals to say remember he said to
[1:11:06] Zerubable
[1:11:07] because brother Brandham has basically
[1:11:09] went into the seals.
[1:11:13] I mean he's pretty much annihilated all
[1:11:16] hope in man-made religion. Amen.
[1:11:19] He's literally took 2,000 years of
[1:11:21] church history and torched it.
[1:11:25] And has literally proven that there is
[1:11:27] no way to gain eternal life. Even in
[1:11:29] those denominational systems, it's
[1:11:31] impossible. It used to could be, but now
[1:11:33] the light moved on.
[1:11:35] And now you've got to come to the light.
[1:11:36] Now there's no chance for the world to
[1:11:39] be redeemed. I'm not We know the foolish
[1:11:41] virgin gain salvation from destruction.
[1:11:43] They're not born again. They just
[1:11:45] receive salvation from destruction. I
[1:11:47] get that. We're not talking about
[1:11:48] salvation from destruction. We're
[1:11:50] talking about redemption.
[1:11:51] Amen.
[1:11:52] And there's no path to redemption
[1:11:54] outside of the redeeming of the word in
[1:11:56] your life because you got to have a
[1:11:58] redeemed faith. You got to have a
[1:12:00] redeemed word. You got to stand perfect
[1:12:02] and marry a perfect son of God. And
[1:12:04] probably said, "How you going to do
[1:12:05] that? How you even going to think about
[1:12:08] it outside of a perfect word? How you
[1:12:11] even you're not even going to get the
[1:12:12] first base. You're not going to get out
[1:12:13] of the dugout. You're not going to get
[1:12:14] in the in the stadium. They're not going
[1:12:15] to let you in the parking lot.
[1:12:21] So he's a signant ring and so so brother
[1:12:23] Brandham is now
[1:12:26] trying trying to say well then my
[1:12:28] goodness then how are we going to get
[1:12:32] back there and that's where the word
[1:12:35] comes forth now for this day to bring us
[1:12:39] to redemption. There's no path to
[1:12:42] redemption outside of the word. Now
[1:12:44] that's not novel or new. That had always
[1:12:46] been that way. That had always been that
[1:12:50] way. There's nobody from Genesis to
[1:12:52] Revelation
[1:12:54] who ever found acceptance in the
[1:12:57] presence of God having rejected any of
[1:13:00] his word.
[1:13:01] Amen.
[1:13:03] So that's not a new thing. It's not a
[1:13:05] William Brandham invention.
[1:13:07] It's all and the scripture is replete
[1:13:09] with example after example after
[1:13:11] example. That's the only way. You've got
[1:13:13] to believe the word for your hour. You
[1:13:15] got to have faith and you got to walk in
[1:13:16] it.
[1:13:16] Amen.
[1:13:18] See,
[1:13:19] so Zerubable and that's why when brother
[1:13:22] Brandham would after he tore down every
[1:13:25] hope that anybody had in
[1:13:28] denominationalism
[1:13:29] then the question begs well then then
[1:13:32] what's left and that's where prophet
[1:13:34] said remember that he said to I know you
[1:13:37] feel like you got no chance. I've I've
[1:13:39] destroyed everything. But remember, he
[1:13:41] said to Zerubabel, "Not by might, not by
[1:13:44] power, but by my spirit, saith the
[1:13:47] Lord."
[1:13:50] So where the spirit of the Lord is,
[1:13:52] there is liberty.
[1:13:54] Outside of the Holy Ghost, there's no
[1:13:56] liberty. You're in bondage.
[1:14:01] And so he's he's he's the Lord's signant
[1:14:04] ring. It's not his own personal
[1:14:06] fulfillment for Zerubabel, you know,
[1:14:08] it's his in in his lifetime, but it's
[1:14:11] actually a in a greater sense a
[1:14:12] messianic fulfillment in the kingdom
[1:14:15] because Zerubbabel is in the you know
[1:14:17] the the whole type is that he's in the
[1:14:19] line of of the Christ line which makes
[1:14:21] him in the son of David because the son
[1:14:23] of David Christ is going to rule in the
[1:14:25] millennium. I can't get sidetracked in
[1:14:27] all that. So, so that's in the same way
[1:14:30] I said to you already the crowning of
[1:14:31] Joshua, you know, as the high priest
[1:14:34] there in Zechariah 3, they put a a fair
[1:14:36] miter on his head because the bride
[1:14:38] would have thus sayeth the Lord, the
[1:14:41] word would be in her, she would be him.
[1:14:44] So, you see what I'm saying? So, so once
[1:14:47] God dispensed with all of the charges
[1:14:49] against her, never to be remembered
[1:14:51] again, kicked the devil out of his
[1:14:53] court, barred him from ever bringing an
[1:14:54] accusation again.
[1:14:57] And so now by the Holy Ghost, there is
[1:14:59] now therefore no condemnation even
[1:15:01] possible to them which are in Christ.
[1:15:03] Say, "Well, what if they make mistakes?"
[1:15:04] What do you mean what if? They do.
[1:15:08] We do. We have.
[1:15:10] Oh, come on.
[1:15:12] We will.
[1:15:15] But you you're unindictable. You're
[1:15:17] unchargeable.
[1:15:18] You're unaccusable. The devil can say
[1:15:20] what he wants. He ain't nobody.
[1:15:24] He has no judicial notice. The courts no
[1:15:26] longer recognize him.
[1:15:28] Not the court of heaven.
[1:15:32] See, in Christ, we stand perfect.
[1:15:35] And so th this is the whole interplay
[1:15:37] between Joshua and Zerubabel. So now
[1:15:39] it's it's me and you, friends.
[1:15:42] You understand that? That just the same
[1:15:45] way that all of Israel, God's elected
[1:15:47] Israel, not all Israel's Israel, it's
[1:15:49] those who have the faith of Abraham,
[1:15:52] all true Israel now had a complete
[1:15:56] cleansing and and and everything against
[1:16:00] them was struck off. And that was the
[1:16:02] verdict. They received a verdict from
[1:16:06] the judge. Not guilty. In fact, is
[1:16:10] innocent. Amen.
[1:16:12] Not only not guilty, but you're actually
[1:16:14] innocent, which means you should have
[1:16:16] never been brought up on charges in the
[1:16:19] first place.
[1:16:21] Hallelujah. And do you realize that our
[1:16:24] high priest has went before the father
[1:16:26] and judged and you and I have received
[1:16:28] the same verdict? You're innocent. You
[1:16:31] should have never been charged in the
[1:16:33] first place. Hallelujah.
[1:16:37] See,
[1:16:38] so it's a sovereign covenant because
[1:16:40] he's a covenant God. He gave a covenant
[1:16:42] to Abraham. He's giving a covenant in
[1:16:44] Hagi. He gives a He's a covenant angel
[1:16:47] in Revelation 10.
[1:16:49] Hallelujah.
[1:16:49] The temple will be rebuilt. He says to
[1:16:51] them, "This is my covenant.
[1:16:54] It will be rebuilt.
[1:16:56] It will be filled with the glory of God.
[1:16:59] The final son of David will rule the
[1:17:03] earth in peace and righteousness. And it
[1:17:06] doesn't matter what Gog does. It doesn't
[1:17:08] matter what Lucifer, the Antichrist, the
[1:17:11] world, your neighbor, even you can't
[1:17:14] stop it. The son of David will rule the
[1:17:17] world in peace and righteousness. And
[1:17:19] there will be a bride who overcomes the
[1:17:22] deception of this age and is seated with
[1:17:25] him on the throne. Amen.
[1:17:27] Hallelujah.
[1:17:29] Amen.
[1:17:30] There's no stopping it.
[1:17:32] That's right.
[1:17:33] Amen.
[1:17:34] See?
[1:17:38] Wow. Who ran that clock forward?
[1:17:46] So, he comes to Genesis. I'll take maybe
[1:17:48] 10 more minutes. I just want to get to a
[1:17:50] certain point.
[1:17:52] I don't know where it is, but we'll get
[1:17:55] to it.
[1:18:02] Yeah.
[1:18:04] Okay.
[1:18:06] So, so in Genesis, give me Ethan, give
[1:18:09] me um let's go to Genesis um
[1:18:13] let's go to Genesis 22
[1:18:16] and we'll start about verse 14.
[1:18:23] Yeah, that's perfect. All right. And
[1:18:26] we'll catch Oh, say if we're starting at
[1:18:28] 14, let's we'll go through 18. All
[1:18:29] right. Abraham
[1:18:31] called the name of that place. Now, this
[1:18:33] is this is Abraham. He's been told,
[1:18:36] "Take your son, your only son. Go to a
[1:18:39] place I'll show you."
[1:18:41] And you know the story.
[1:18:43] And now now, wa watch this now.
[1:18:48] And Abraham called the name of that
[1:18:50] place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this
[1:18:55] day in the mount of the Lord it shall be
[1:18:59] seen. Now just hold right there Eith. So
[1:19:02] you you've got this this promise coming
[1:19:05] to pass over a long time and Abraham's
[1:19:08] got to live a whole pile of regular life
[1:19:10] to get to it.
[1:19:11] Amen.
[1:19:12] Abraham's going to have his ups and
[1:19:14] downs. He's he he even as Abram
[1:19:17] especially, he's going to really drop
[1:19:19] the ball several times. Now, he he never
[1:19:22] staggered at the promise. Paul tells us
[1:19:24] that. But he didn't live a perfect
[1:19:27] example. He got down in Egypt, backslid
[1:19:30] lying, did it again to Aimilec in of the
[1:19:33] Philistine of the Philistine king. We
[1:19:35] all know that. But he never staggered at
[1:19:37] the promise of God. Can you believe
[1:19:39] that? that you could of all the times
[1:19:43] you have failed God. Yet God does not
[1:19:45] recognize a a sin in your faith.
[1:19:49] Hallelujah. That thrills me because I
[1:19:52] had way more transgressions than I'm
[1:19:54] comfortable with and I might have some
[1:19:56] more tomorrow, but the Lord knows I've
[1:19:58] never disbelieved his word.
[1:20:02] Hallelujah.
[1:20:03] Hallelujah.
[1:20:05] Oh, I want to run. As brother John
[1:20:09] Danquist says, I want to run.
[1:20:12] One of these days, I'm going to shock
[1:20:14] y'all to peace. I'm going to fly out
[1:20:16] that door and go down the road screaming
[1:20:17] and brother Jack will be right behind
[1:20:19] me.
[1:20:21] They'll come lock us up. Brother Tony,
[1:20:22] you up to come get us out.
[1:20:28] So he So he had a whole lot of life to
[1:20:31] get there and none of his failures
[1:20:34] stopped it. That's the beauty. He still
[1:20:36] had the son
[1:20:39] through adversity. He still had it. He
[1:20:41] had a lot of problems. Abraham, as I was
[1:20:44] saying to you, you know, he was a a
[1:20:45] warrior chief. He wasn't just some
[1:20:47] simple sheep herder. I mean, that was
[1:20:49] one of his his credentials. He's a great
[1:20:51] a great sheep herder. Camels and sheep
[1:20:54] and richest man in the area. and the
[1:20:57] whole region full of wisdom. Man, he got
[1:21:01] that through hard trials and overcoming
[1:21:03] and making mistakes and repenting and
[1:21:05] coming back to God just like you and me.
[1:21:08] See, so don't think that I I'm here to
[1:21:11] tell you God made the covenant with that
[1:21:13] kind of a man. He'll keep the covenant
[1:21:15] with this kind of people.
[1:21:18] Amen.
[1:21:19] And so we find that finally he gets the
[1:21:22] son and then and then you think
[1:21:25] trouble's over. Yeah. troubles were over
[1:21:27] in the sense that once he had the son,
[1:21:29] once the office of son was on the scene,
[1:21:31] he never stumbled like that again. He
[1:21:33] never lied anymore. His record stayed
[1:21:36] clean
[1:21:37] because that's the power of the son of
[1:21:40] God
[1:21:40] when it lives inside you. And so, so we
[1:21:44] find that that then he wakes up on a day
[1:21:48] and he's told, "Now take this son to
[1:21:50] everything that you fought for for all
[1:21:52] those years and sacrifice him to me."
[1:21:57] And Abraham knew what that meant. God
[1:22:00] was very unambiguous.
[1:22:03] You're going to take him and you're
[1:22:04] going to sacrifice him. And actually,
[1:22:05] this isn't a metaphor. I'm going to show
[1:22:07] you where to do it. I'm going to
[1:22:09] actually show you the place to lay him
[1:22:11] down. This is for real. Make sure you
[1:22:13] take a knife. And so they're walking
[1:22:16] along. Now, this is just before the word
[1:22:20] you just read. Abram, Abraham called the
[1:22:23] name of the place Jehovah Gyra because
[1:22:25] we know Jehovah Gyra is the Lord your
[1:22:27] provider. See? And so, so, so Gyra
[1:22:31] literally means God sees and will see to
[1:22:34] it. So, that's how he's your provider.
[1:22:36] I'm here to tell you, I don't care what
[1:22:37] you're facing, God sees. You got all
[1:22:40] kinds of things you need and you're on
[1:22:41] you're in prayer. Don't you worry, he'll
[1:22:42] see to it.
[1:22:44] Now, it might not come like you think or
[1:22:46] even like you're asking, but it'll come
[1:22:47] on time and it'll be exactly like he
[1:22:49] needs. He knows you need it to be
[1:22:52] and you should rejoice in that.
[1:22:55] I'm so glad he doesn't just give me my
[1:22:57] will
[1:22:59] because I have messed up my own self so
[1:23:01] many times I'm in no shape to lead
[1:23:04] myself. Amen.
[1:23:05] Amen.
[1:23:06] And so he he he gets to a place. He
[1:23:10] stops the men with him. Says, "Now the
[1:23:12] lad and I will go on from here." Now
[1:23:15] watch him. Watch him speak squirrels
[1:23:18] into existence. Watch the third pull in
[1:23:20] Genesis.
[1:23:22] You guys stay here. I and the lad will
[1:23:26] go yonder mountain and I and the lad
[1:23:30] will return.
[1:23:34] Now he's going to kill him.
[1:23:35] And he's saying, "I am this lad will
[1:23:38] return."
[1:23:40] See, say, did he think he wasn't going
[1:23:42] to do it? No, he actually knew he would
[1:23:44] do it. But Paul picks that up and said
[1:23:46] that he he really he just thought to
[1:23:48] himself, I love how a prophet can go
[1:23:50] right all the way back into the heart of
[1:23:51] Abraham and he can say, you know what,
[1:23:53] what he was thinking about was that God
[1:23:55] gave me this child. I was I was dead. I
[1:23:57] couldn't have him. And the same and he's
[1:23:59] the I know he's the promise. I know God
[1:24:01] don't lie. I know he's already told me,
[1:24:03] I'm going to bless your seed as the as
[1:24:04] the sands and the stars, and here's
[1:24:06] going to be the beginning of it. So, I
[1:24:08] know that even if I kill him, God will
[1:24:11] have to raise him from the dead.
[1:24:14] So, he's willing to to literally go to
[1:24:17] the wall and back based on a promise.
[1:24:19] I'm here to tell you, no wonder he was
[1:24:21] the father of faith
[1:24:25] because he had a rugged faith in God's
[1:24:27] word. And that's what Paul said. He
[1:24:29] never staggered at the promise of God.
[1:24:32] Amen.
[1:24:34] And now it's got to happen because he
[1:24:36] spoke it. Now catch it. He couldn't
[1:24:38] speak it according to his own desire no
[1:24:40] more than a prophet in the woods could
[1:24:42] say they'll be here. They'll be here.
[1:24:43] God had said to him, "Say where they'll
[1:24:45] be."
[1:24:46] Cuz he had been pondering, "If you say
[1:24:48] to this mountain," he said, "I had
[1:24:49] avoided that. I wouldn't preach on it
[1:24:50] because I wasn't sure how to interpret
[1:24:51] that." And he said, "I'm in the woods
[1:24:53] thinking of that." And he says, "Now say
[1:24:54] where they'll be." And and just like
[1:24:57] Abraham, God had already told him what
[1:24:59] would be his future. So now he's saying
[1:25:02] based on a promise and that become the
[1:25:04] word.
[1:25:06] Amen.
[1:25:09] He had was full of faith and then he's
[1:25:12] walking along and he's getting closer
[1:25:15] and closer and closer and the dead hour
[1:25:18] is approaching. And this is for real.
[1:25:21] This ain't no joke. This is hap. This is
[1:25:23] my life in real time. I I ain't got time
[1:25:26] to run to church. I can't call somebody
[1:25:28] to pray for me. I'm on a path to do the
[1:25:31] unthinkable.
[1:25:33] My life is about to be destroyed.
[1:25:37] You think that's not in his mind?
[1:25:39] But a word's already been spoken.
[1:25:42] I and the lad will return. Hallelujah.
[1:25:47] Said
[1:25:50] said they go along and Isaac's no dummy.
[1:25:56] He's been raised to know about this. And
[1:25:59] he says, "So, Dad,
[1:26:02] um, behold the fire
[1:26:06] and behold the wood,
[1:26:08] but I know we need a burnt I know we
[1:26:10] need an offering. Where's the lamb?
[1:26:13] You you did you forget to bring in a
[1:26:14] lamb? And Abraham, now watch the third
[1:26:17] pull come again.
[1:26:19] Third pull drops down on him in Genesis.
[1:26:21] Third, this is Genesis third pull. And
[1:26:23] he says, "My son, the Lord shall provide
[1:26:27] himself a sacrifice."
[1:26:31] Maybe didn't even know how that would
[1:26:33] happen.
[1:26:34] It wasn't his business to know how it
[1:26:36] would happen. First of all, it was God
[1:26:39] saying that for the atonement of sin,
[1:26:41] God would provide himself
[1:26:43] as your sacrifice.
[1:26:45] Hallelujah. You understand that? No
[1:26:48] prophet, priest, or king could die for
[1:26:50] you. You couldn't die for you. There had
[1:26:51] been, brother V said, there had been
[1:26:52] many great men and many of them had died
[1:26:55] for a great cause, but there was never a
[1:26:58] man who could lay his own life down and
[1:27:00] pick it back up again.
[1:27:02] Hallelujah. And God said, "When it comes
[1:27:04] to your atonement, I will be your
[1:27:06] sacrifice."
[1:27:09] Hallelujah.
[1:27:11] And he speaks the word.
[1:27:15] God shall provide himself a sacrifice.
[1:27:19] Now, you say, "Brother Jason, you're
[1:27:22] using a lot of preacher license. You
[1:27:24] sound like you're making a pretty broad
[1:27:25] assumption." That would be a fair case
[1:27:27] if I didn't have a quote.
[1:27:32] You could make a fair argument. You
[1:27:35] could impugn me for making things up
[1:27:38] when I'm not sure. But I got a quote.
[1:27:43] When brother Brandham comes back and he
[1:27:44] this is in Speak to the Mountain and
[1:27:47] he's come back that next day and he's
[1:27:50] went through that I'm not preaching on
[1:27:52] it today. I'm going to get to it later.
[1:27:54] And he's went through the agony of what
[1:27:56] it took to get those squirrels in his
[1:27:59] possession. It wasn't just
[1:28:01] straightforward and they didn't just
[1:28:02] fall in his pocket. And he kept having
[1:28:05] to double back and he kept getting it
[1:28:07] wrong. He kept making an assumption
[1:28:09] until he found out, "No, that's not
[1:28:11] right. Oh, well, it must be this until
[1:28:14] it wasn't."
[1:28:16] Well, it must be this until it wasn't.
[1:28:19] Oh, it's okay. I got it now. Here it is.
[1:28:21] No, it's not.
[1:28:23] Good grief. How's it going to happen?
[1:28:25] Just Just relax. I the Lord will make it
[1:28:29] happen.
[1:28:31] And when the prophet relaxed and quit
[1:28:34] quit quit getting affected by how dark
[1:28:37] it was or what other people were saying
[1:28:40] or what he thought they would think and
[1:28:42] now he's got a complex they're going to
[1:28:44] think I lied and it's going to make me
[1:28:45] look bad. He's got to get all that
[1:28:47] pride.
[1:28:48] Don't throw a rock at me.
[1:28:50] He He had to get He had to conquer his
[1:28:52] pride just like you.
[1:28:53] Like me.
[1:28:55] Hallelujah. Jesus had to conquer pride.
[1:28:57] He was tempted in all ways.
[1:29:00] There's none good but one.
[1:29:02] Hallelujah.
[1:29:03] Let our prophet be a man just like us.
[1:29:07] See, so so he he and so now he comes
[1:29:11] back and it's the next morning I think
[1:29:13] of uh next morning or next day and he's
[1:29:16] he's taken an offering. Brother Neville
[1:29:19] says,
[1:29:21] "Brother Brandham,
[1:29:23] Sister Haddie, she wants to do something
[1:29:26] for our building program. She gave $20
[1:29:28] into the offering." And Brother Brandham
[1:29:30] says, "Goodness gracious." He said, "It
[1:29:32] would take her a half a year scratching
[1:29:35] on those old hills trying to get enough
[1:29:37] crops to make 20 bucks." We're talking
[1:29:39] poor.
[1:29:40] Amen.
[1:29:42] And and he said, "So I just thought,
[1:29:44] well, I'll just take it back and slip it
[1:29:46] to her and I'll leave it and I'll leave
[1:29:48] it." she won't know. And of course, the
[1:29:51] Lord wouldn't let him do that.
[1:29:52] Amen.
[1:29:53] And brother Brandham, he felt sorry for
[1:29:55] her. And the Lord said, Jesus stood by
[1:29:58] the wall at the treasury and watched
[1:30:00] millionaires come in and drop big sums
[1:30:02] of money into his ministry treasury. He
[1:30:05] never said a word. And then a little
[1:30:07] widow woman came and put two mites,
[1:30:09] which was less than a penny. And Jesus
[1:30:12] stops everything and tells his disciples
[1:30:13] that woman, she gave more. Let this
[1:30:17] story be told for as long as the gospel.
[1:30:19] That woman gave more than all the others
[1:30:22] cuz they gave from their abundance.
[1:30:24] And there's people who won't even do
[1:30:26] that.
[1:30:27] There's people who the Lord blesses them
[1:30:29] and puts money in their bank and gives
[1:30:30] them cars and trucks and they take trips
[1:30:32] and vacations and have all kinds of
[1:30:34] stuff and they never give the Lord back
[1:30:35] his tithes at all.
[1:30:37] Ever. Never.
[1:30:39] Never.
[1:30:40] Not. I mean, so such a thief at this
[1:30:43] point. I I'd hate to say how far in debt
[1:30:45] they are to the Lord.
[1:30:48] See, so that wasn't in my notes. That
[1:30:50] was free. If I going to talk about
[1:30:53] money, it's free.
[1:30:55] We're not going to take up an offering.
[1:30:56] I already did.
[1:30:59] It's a shame. You're a complete thief.
[1:31:02] I'm glad we don't have that problem
[1:31:04] pervasive here in the assembly. Praise
[1:31:06] the Lord. I sure God bless all you
[1:31:08] people. You give abundantly. We're able
[1:31:10] to do so much with the work of God. I
[1:31:12] could just spend the rest of the day
[1:31:13] telling you the things that we're able
[1:31:14] to accomplish with it.
[1:31:16] Amen. So he says, "But she gave out of
[1:31:21] her necessity. This is food off her
[1:31:25] table."
[1:31:25] Yeah.
[1:31:26] See, and and the Lord said to Brother
[1:31:29] Brandham, "And Jesus never stopped her."
[1:31:32] So, Brother Brandham said, "I just took
[1:31:34] that 20 and stuck it back down in my
[1:31:35] pocket because I knew the blessing of
[1:31:38] the Lord would be worth way more to her
[1:31:41] than this $20 bill."
[1:31:44] See? And so, so he he's sitting there
[1:31:48] and he starts telling that story and he
[1:31:51] tells the whole story in detail of what
[1:31:53] just happened to him in the woods. And
[1:31:55] then he said, "We go back. You've
[1:31:56] already spoke the word and say where
[1:31:57] they'll be." And then it wasn't. Then I
[1:31:58] looked, then it wasn't. and they said
[1:31:59] this and I was worried about this and it
[1:32:01] was getting dark and you know but after
[1:32:04] it all I got him. I got him. And brother
[1:32:08] Brandham says and I said the only thing
[1:32:14] I could think it to be would be this.
[1:32:17] When God was trying to tell Abraham how
[1:32:20] he was going to bless him, I said if
[1:32:24] this be my new ministry that's coming in
[1:32:26] third pull something greater than he
[1:32:29] will finally confirm it in that little
[1:32:31] building. I said if it be that like
[1:32:33] Abraham the thing that Abraham needed
[1:32:36] was a sacrifice instead of a son in
[1:32:39] Genesis 22. And then God held his hand
[1:32:42] from sacrificing his son and there was a
[1:32:45] ram there. What put the ram there? Third
[1:32:48] pull.
[1:32:49] What put Brother Brandon's connecting
[1:32:51] his third pull experience to Genesis 22.
[1:32:55] I'm telling you, this was happening to a
[1:32:56] real man in real time
[1:32:59] who had real problems and real ups and
[1:33:01] downs, but he believed the word and he
[1:33:03] spoke the word.
[1:33:04] I'm here to tell you, I've already said
[1:33:06] I'm a believer and there's no taking it
[1:33:08] back. I've already spoken that I could
[1:33:10] never leave it and I'll never leave it.
[1:33:12] I've already spoken the rapture's coming
[1:33:14] in my lifetime.
[1:33:16] Hallelujah. And it's irreversable.
[1:33:21] Glory to God. Say, you might die
[1:33:22] tomorrow. I might, but in this
[1:33:24] generation, you're the last generation
[1:33:26] that will ever be. You are the people
[1:33:30] upon whom the ends of the world have
[1:33:32] come.
[1:33:34] And if there was ever a time where you
[1:33:36] need thirdpool power, it's now. Cuz the
[1:33:39] world's getting worse and will get much
[1:33:40] worse. Amen.
[1:33:42] Amen.
[1:33:44] And you'll never find success in it.
[1:33:48] Stand. You'll never find success in it
[1:33:53] outside of dedication
[1:33:55] and consecration.
[1:33:59] I hope that I have made a scriptural
[1:34:02] case to you today.
[1:34:04] I hope teenagers,
[1:34:06] young people, 20somes,
[1:34:08] I hope I have made a case to you today.
[1:34:11] 30somes, married, elderly, I hope I have
[1:34:15] made a Bible case to you today that you
[1:34:17] can see the day and the hour that you
[1:34:21] live in.
[1:34:23] And it ain't an accident
[1:34:25] cuz there are no accidents.
[1:34:29] There are only Gods.
[1:34:32] Amen.
[1:34:34] As brother Lee says on our morning Eagle
[1:34:37] Fellowship Bible study, there's no
[1:34:39] accidents. He will always say, "There's
[1:34:41] only Gods."
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:34:44] Bow your heads with me,
[1:34:47] please, all over the audience.
[1:34:50] Thank you, Lord,
[1:34:52] for allowing me to get through to a
[1:34:54] point where I feel the green light from
[1:34:58] the Holy Spirit to to stop
[1:35:04] No need to go further today.
[1:35:07] And I believe your word has accomplished
[1:35:09] much. I'm believing it by faith, Lord. I
[1:35:12] speak it. I believe it. I won't take it
[1:35:15] back. I'm believing it's an arrow of
[1:35:17] deliverance to all your people.
[1:35:20] It makes me think about my own life,
[1:35:23] Lord. And I hope that every man, woman,
[1:35:24] boy, and girl right now with heads bowed
[1:35:27] and eyes closed,
[1:35:29] not only looking around, but not
[1:35:30] thinking around, just focus on yourself
[1:35:33] for a moment. You're in the presence of
[1:35:35] God. Push out push out shopping
[1:35:39] tomorrow. Push out events for later
[1:35:42] today. Push out your lunch. Don't Don't
[1:35:44] worry about nothing right now. Don't
[1:35:46] forget who's standing near you. Just now
[1:35:47] you and God. I'm not going to call
[1:35:49] anybody out. We're not going to have
[1:35:50] some embarrassing thing. I just want you
[1:35:52] to concentrate for a minute. Think,
[1:35:54] think with me. Join me
[1:35:57] as I think about my own life, Lord.
[1:36:01] Where do I measure up on this scale?
[1:36:04] Where am I at, oh God?
[1:36:07] I think about so much that more that I
[1:36:09] could be doing, so much more.
[1:36:11] So much that could have been
[1:36:12] accomplished if I had just been more
[1:36:14] diligent over the years.
[1:36:17] It seems as nothing, Lord. Even all that
[1:36:19] I accomplished, it was just your great
[1:36:22] grace to make it happen. I I can take no
[1:36:25] credit. And I mean that honestly. I can
[1:36:27] take none. Zero. Cuz I know, Lord, the
[1:36:30] weaknesses that I have. And I know how
[1:36:32] short I come.
[1:36:34] And I'm sure that everyone in this
[1:36:36] building today, if they're really
[1:36:37] honest, will own that. They'll own that
[1:36:40] in your presence right now.
[1:36:43] But Lord, when I
[1:36:45] when I think of how hopeless it looks,
[1:36:47] if I look at it from my own self, I just
[1:36:51] fall back and say, "Let the weak say I'm
[1:36:54] strong."
[1:36:56] Lord, I know this much. Here's what I
[1:36:58] know. When I when all of it fades away
[1:37:01] and it all just falls silent
[1:37:04] and I'm alone and it's just you and me,
[1:37:08] I know I can raise up my hands and I can
[1:37:12] say, "Lord, I love you. And I know that
[1:37:16] you know it's true.
[1:37:20] And I believe your word, every last word
[1:37:24] of it. And I know that you know that's
[1:37:27] true. And I desire
[1:37:30] more than anything
[1:37:33] that my life will be brought completely
[1:37:35] subject to every word of God as this
[1:37:39] world is flaming out. It's going down in
[1:37:42] destruction.
[1:37:44] And there's got to be an ascending order
[1:37:46] for your bride, Lord, to rise up as
[1:37:48] eagles and soar over it to live in
[1:37:51] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And I
[1:37:53] long for that. I desire that. I press
[1:37:56] towards the mark. I press
[1:37:59] and I know that you know that that's a
[1:38:02] true desire in my heart.
[1:38:06] So I pray for myself. I pray for these
[1:38:08] people. I pray for all of those who may
[1:38:11] be listening.
[1:38:13] Help us, Lord God. Help us to reent our
[1:38:18] non-committal ways. Help us to repent of
[1:38:21] our crazy thinking. Help us to repent of
[1:38:24] our dilatory laziness.
[1:38:26] Help us, Jesus. We're before you humbly,
[1:38:29] Lord God. Nothing in my arms I bring. Of
[1:38:34] nothing I can offer you of any value.
[1:38:36] You've never asked for anything but my
[1:38:38] heart.
[1:38:40] And I guess since you made it, it's
[1:38:41] valuable to you, so you can have it. My
[1:38:44] whole life is yours, Lord. May I just
[1:38:48] have a fresh cleansing this morning,
[1:38:51] Lord. Maybe people didn't expect this
[1:38:53] kind of prayer after a sermon styled
[1:38:55] like that, but Lord, that's how I feel.
[1:38:57] That's in fact is Lord, I've been so
[1:39:00] astonished
[1:39:02] that as I listen to brother Brandham,
[1:39:04] every time he starts telling these
[1:39:06] stories of the third pull, he ends it by
[1:39:08] imploring the audience, he says, "I need
[1:39:11] a fresh repentance. I need a fresh
[1:39:13] consecration. Me, Lord, help me today.
[1:39:15] Help this people." And he he takes them
[1:39:18] back to dedication and repentance and
[1:39:20] consecration.
[1:39:22] Let that be our theme today, Lord God.
[1:39:24] As we continue in this series, let the
[1:39:26] people not soon forget that it's all
[1:39:29] about making ourselves available for the
[1:39:32] master's usage.
[1:39:35] You've set aside our sin completely.
[1:39:39] You've set aside every failure we could
[1:39:41] ever have. You've already judged us in
[1:39:42] Christ, so I already don't have to worry
[1:39:44] about that.
[1:39:46] You put a gene of God in me that could
[1:39:48] believe your word, and it it already
[1:39:50] does. and I've been born again of the
[1:39:52] spirit of God and I already have and
[1:39:54] it's irreversible.
[1:39:55] I've already passed from death to life.
[1:39:57] I can never enter into the judgment. So
[1:40:00] what's left for me but to serve you with
[1:40:02] all my mind and all my body and all my
[1:40:05] soul, all my heart, all my spirit,
[1:40:08] everything in dedication to you for the
[1:40:11] world to come.
[1:40:13] May you grant it in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:40:16] Let's sing, Brother Tony.
[1:40:22] Oh Jesus.
[1:40:25] Oh my. Oh, we're going to go old school
[1:40:28] today.
[1:40:28] Do you know?
[1:40:31] How many want to go old school with
[1:40:32] brother Tony today?
[1:40:35] Please don't turn.
[1:40:37] Oh my.
[1:40:41] Oh Jesus.
[1:40:44] [Music]
[1:40:47] My Jesus,
[1:40:53] without him,
[1:40:54] without him,
[1:40:57] how
[1:41:00] would that's beautiful, brother Anthony.
[1:41:02] Let's sing it again now all together.
[1:41:07] Jesus.
[1:41:09] [Music]
[1:41:12] Oh Jesus,
[1:41:14] [Music]
[1:41:15] [Applause]
[1:41:16] [Music]
[1:41:19] do you know him
[1:41:22] today?
[1:41:26] Turn him
[1:41:29] away.
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:37] Oh, Jesus.
[1:41:40] [Music]
[1:41:43] For without him,
[1:41:47] how lost
[1:41:49] I would be.
[1:41:56] Without him,
[1:41:59] I could
[1:42:02] do nothing.
[1:42:04] [Music]
[1:42:06] Without him, without
[1:42:11] I surely
[1:42:14] fail.
[1:42:15] [Music]
[1:42:17] Ain't that beautiful?
[1:42:19] Without
[1:42:21] him, I would
[1:42:25] be drifting
[1:42:28] like a ship.
[1:42:30] Like a ship
[1:42:32] without a sail,
[1:42:34] without
[1:42:37] a
[1:42:40] Oh, raise up those hands now. Oh, Jesus.
[1:42:44] [Music]
[1:42:48] Oh,
[1:42:49] oh, Jesus.
[1:42:51] [Music]
[1:42:52] Do you know him?
[1:42:54] Do you know him?
[1:42:56] Do you know him today?
[1:42:59] Please don't turn him away.
[1:43:01] Turn him
[1:43:03] away. Hey. Oh Jesus.
[1:43:09] Oh, let's just take a little time here
[1:43:11] now.
[1:43:12] Oh Jesus.
[1:43:16] Maybe you need a conference with God
[1:43:18] without him.
[1:43:20] Why don't you just talk it over with him
[1:43:22] right now?
[1:43:24] Oh, as we sing it again now, just have
[1:43:27] that time with the Lord
[1:43:30] Jesus.
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:34] for more Jesus.
[1:43:37] [Music]
[1:43:40] Do you know him
[1:43:44] today?
[1:43:46] Please don't turn him
[1:43:50] away.
[1:43:53] Jesus.
[1:43:57] My
[1:43:59] Jesus.
[1:44:01] Jesus.
[1:44:03] Without
[1:44:05] him,
[1:44:07] how lost
[1:44:09] I would be.
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:14] Amen. We're going to dismiss you and
[1:44:19] allow the worship just to carry on
[1:44:20] uninterrupted.
[1:44:24] I've enjoyed I'm enjoying this word.
[1:44:26] It's meaning a lot to me at a very
[1:44:29] personal level. more than you can know,
[1:44:32] more than I can convey, but it's meaning
[1:44:35] everything to me. I want it so bad in my
[1:44:39] life. I want it so bad in your life.
[1:44:42] Amen.
[1:44:43] I want to see the power of God
[1:44:44] unfettered,
[1:44:46] unobstructed,
[1:44:48] moving through our young people, moving
[1:44:51] through our old people. I want to see as
[1:44:53] brother Matt was proving to us, my
[1:44:55] goodness, proving from those writings of
[1:44:58] the early fathers and a prophet of this
[1:45:00] day, there should be no question that
[1:45:03] that the that the whole theological
[1:45:07] ideology of miracles and the power of
[1:45:09] God and the gifts of the spirit and the
[1:45:11] supernatural, they're they're completely
[1:45:13] wrong. All of those old original
[1:45:16] fathers, that stuff was moving hundreds
[1:45:18] of years into the church after the
[1:45:20] apostles. That proves it to me. I sit
[1:45:22] back there this morning astonished
[1:45:24] trying to study listening to that and it
[1:45:26] left me astonished at the clarity of
[1:45:30] language. If you didn't catch the adult
[1:45:32] Sunday school class, I would advise you
[1:45:34] to get it. I'm here to tell you. You
[1:45:36] want to talk about putting something in
[1:45:38] your pocket to evangelize with? Talk to
[1:45:41] somebody in love now. In love because
[1:45:43] they don't know. You didn't know at one
[1:45:44] time. See, but get that Sunday school
[1:45:47] lesson. and and and brother Matthew
[1:45:50] offered to send you the quotes on a on
[1:45:52] his PowerPoint and send them to your
[1:45:54] email. Don't go home without it. My And
[1:45:57] then you talk about something to witness
[1:45:59] to your family with to say, "Look,
[1:46:01] you've been you've been under a
[1:46:02] delusion. The the the the systems of
[1:46:05] man, they pulled a wool over your eyes.
[1:46:07] It they're they're wrong. The power of
[1:46:10] God is still here.
[1:46:12] Divine healing is still here. The gifts
[1:46:14] of the spirit are still here. They've
[1:46:15] always been here. And we're in the age
[1:46:18] of complete restoration. I'm here to
[1:46:20] tell you something, friends. There ought
[1:46:22] not to be one thing in our lives at this
[1:46:25] point to hinder the third pull working
[1:46:29] at every and every channel. God bless
[1:46:32] you. Turn around and shake hands with
[1:46:33] somebody near you. We're happy to
[1:46:37] have you here today. Now, you make sure
[1:46:39] our visitors Amen. Remember, Brother and
[1:46:42] Sister Smith in the back. Come, Brother
[1:46:43] Luther. Uh um you're going to take this.

[1:46:49] with Luther. Sister Melissa. Let me have
[1:46:52] my ministers gather up here with me,

[1:46:57] waving at me if I haven't dropped it out
[1:47:00] of my Bible.
[1:47:03] That's possible. It's all right. I got
[1:47:06] more.
[1:47:07] Amen.
[1:47:13] Now, for those of you who are unfamiliar
[1:47:15] with this, this is according to the book
[1:47:17] of Acts. You find that they taken aprons
[1:47:21] from the body of St. Paul and they laid
[1:47:23] them on the sick and great miracles took
[1:47:26] place. Now, we're not St. Paul and we
[1:47:29] don't have his apron, but what we do
[1:47:31] have is a piece of cloth that can rep in
[1:47:34] a representative way will pray over
[1:47:36] this. Now, you don't anoint prayer
[1:47:38] cloths, brother Ram. We don't do that.
[1:47:40] But what we do is we pray over them.
[1:47:42] Amen. And there have been incalculable
[1:47:45] amount of miracles that have taken place
[1:47:48] and this was a great need. Refresh me
[1:47:50] again on the details.
[1:47:53] Right.
[1:47:57] Amen. Amen. So, it's a little boy
[1:47:59] suffering from some autistic uh
[1:48:02] tendencies and it's getting worse and
[1:48:04] worse and right now it's just running
[1:48:06] through the family. It's a very serious
[1:48:08] case. And so, uh, fortunately, these
[1:48:11] people happen to know a believer.
[1:48:13] Amen.
[1:48:14] And a believer has happens to know other
[1:48:16] believers.
[1:48:18] And we can all gather around. See? All
[1:48:20] right. All right. Sister Melissa, you
[1:48:22] put your hand on it first because you're
[1:48:23] going to deliver it. Brother Luther, on
[1:48:25] top of there. Come on, brothers. Join
[1:48:26] right in here. Amen. Father, in the name
[1:48:30] of Jesus, we take this little piece of
[1:48:33] cloth, Lord, and in representation of
[1:48:35] the Holy Ghost. We send it forth, Lord,
[1:48:37] to the sick and the afflicted, and we
[1:48:39] ask and we speak in the name of Jesus
[1:48:41] Christ that there should be deliverance
[1:48:43] and healing, and that the that the bonds
[1:48:45] of the enemy should be snapped, the
[1:48:47] feathers broken, the chains fall. May
[1:48:49] you grant it, oh God. May it happen even
[1:48:52] speedily, Lord. May there be a great
[1:48:54] testimony. So many testimonies have
[1:48:56] returned from this simple act of faith.
