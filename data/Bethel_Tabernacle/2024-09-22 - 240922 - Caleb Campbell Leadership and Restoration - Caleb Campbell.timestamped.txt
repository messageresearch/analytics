[20:12] on him but God had set him free so he
[20:14] said if I ever could have the devil

[30:11] the Lord on a beautiful Sunday morning
[30:13] isn't it amen sure is a special thing to
[30:16] have a church to come to that believes
[30:18] the word amen that's no place I'd rather
[30:20] be this morning than in church amen any
[30:23] visitors this morning want to just say
[30:25] God bless you sure it's good to have my
[30:27] cousin and Philip here this morning he's
[30:29] from Oklahoma he's really more like a
[30:31] brother to me um his his wife had a
[30:34] family event there in North Carolina so
[30:36] he had made a special trip to be with us
[30:38] here today and just an awesome surprise
[30:40] amen and uh really appreciate him the
[30:43] fellowship close friends like that are a
[30:44] special gift from God Amen I told Pastor
[30:48] after Wednesday night that um it was
[30:51] just incredible how much his heart and
[30:54] and what he was delivering had been my
[30:56] heart for this service this weekend and
[30:58] and some of the same things this morning
[31:00] with with brother Matt and Sunday school
[31:02] and uh it seems like it's if it's heavy
[31:05] on the Lord's heart then it should be
[31:07] heavy on our heart amen and it just
[31:09] seems like that's where the Lord's
[31:10] taking us this morning so and all I want
[31:13] to know is I just want to hear from the
[31:14] Lord this morning amen have an uplifted
[31:17] hand who wants to hear from the Lord I
[31:18] want his define thoughts I just want to
[31:20] move out of the way this morning and I
[31:23] believe if you have a need on your heart
[31:24] I believe the Lord can discern that need
[31:27] you know we stand up here as ministers
[31:30] trying to not just trying to preach a
[31:32] sermon but trying to find the channel of
[31:35] the holy spirit amen and to try to let
[31:37] him operate through US amen we're we're
[31:39] back there praying and we have notes and
[31:41] we do these things but I can't say
[31:44] nothing that would be a blessing unless
[31:45] God comes in the service amen and
[31:47] anoints it amen so if you have a need
[31:49] this morning just lift it up in your
[31:51] heart God knows he can minister to that
[31:53] need even if it's not in my notes amen
[31:56] um we just want to remember pastor as
[31:58] well um my my Dad's foot actually as
[32:02] well he he's been suffering the last
[32:03] several weeks he's got a burn and he

[32:15] to turn to Joshua
[32:18] 24 Joshua chapter 24 we're going to read
[32:22] verses 15 verses 14 and 15
[32:28] you just set that there for thanks
[32:31] bro and then we're going to turn into
[32:34] the book of 2 Chronicles this morning 2
[32:37] Chronicles so it reads this now
[32:40] therefore fear the lord and serve him in
[32:42] sincerity and in truth and put away the
[32:45] gods which your father served on the
[32:48] other side of the flood and in Egypt and
[32:50] serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil
[32:53] unto you to serve the Lord choose you
[32:56] this day whom you shall serve whether
[32:59] the gods which your fathers serve that
[33:00] were on the other side of the flood or
[33:03] the god of the amorites in whose land
[33:05] you dwell but as for me and my house we
[33:08] will serve the Lord who makes that
[33:10] declaration with me this morning amen
[33:12] let's turn over in the Bible to 2
[33:13] Chronicles the 34th chapter we're going
[33:16] to kind of jump around in this but uh
[33:19] Lord had had it on my heart to read a
[33:21] portion of this so we'll just start in
[33:23] verse one at 2 Chronicles 34:1 it says
[33:27] Josiah
[33:28] was 8 years old when he began to Reign
[33:30] and he reigned in Jerusalem 1 and3 years
[33:33] and he did that which was right in the
[33:35] sight of the Lord and walked in the ways
[33:37] of David his father and declined neither
[33:40] to the left hand nor to the right I'm
[33:42] sorry neither to the right hand nor to
[33:44] the left for he was for it was in the
[33:46] eighth year of his Reign while he was
[33:48] yet young and he began to seek after the
[33:50] god of David his father and in the 12th
[33:53] year he began to purge Judah and
[33:55] Jerusalem from the high places and The
[33:58] Groves and the carved images and the
[34:00] molten images and they break down the
[34:02] altars of balum in his presence and the
[34:05] images that were on high above them he
[34:07] cut down in the Groves and the carved
[34:09] images and the molten images he break in
[34:12] pieces and made dust of them and stoed
[34:15] stro it upon the graves of them that had
[34:17] sacrificed unto them and he burnt burnt
[34:20] the burn bones of the priests upon their
[34:23] altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem
[34:27] skipping down to verse 8 it says now in
[34:29] the 18th year of his Reign when he
[34:31] purged the land and the house he sent
[34:33] shaan the son of ailah and Messiah the
[34:37] governor of the city and joah the son of
[34:39] jehoahaz the recorder to repair the
[34:42] house of the Lord his God so this was
[34:45] the beginning of a work to rebuild and
[34:47] to restore the house of the Lord amen
[34:49] and when you move to verse 14 and it
[34:51] says and when they brought out the money
[34:54] that was brought into the house of the
[34:56] Lord hilaya the priest found a book of
[34:59] the law of the Lord given by Moses and
[35:02] Hil kayap answered and said unto schaen
[35:05] the Scribe I have found the book of the
[35:07] law in the house of the Lord and hkaya
[35:10] delivered the book to schaen so what
[35:14] happened is is as they begin working on
[35:16] the restoration of the house of the Lord
[35:18] they found this word they found this
[35:20] book amen God had a book that he had
[35:23] preserved amen that God preserved
[35:26] throughout all the ruins and of all the
[35:28] bad decisions that had been made amen
[35:30] moving down to verse 18 and it says then
[35:32] schaen the Scribe told the king saying
[35:34] hilaya the priest hath given me a book
[35:37] and Shea and read it before the king and
[35:39] it came to pass when the king had heard
[35:40] the words of the law that he Ren his
[35:42] clothes and the King commanded Hokah and
[35:45] aim and the son of schaen and abdon the
[35:47] son of Micah and schaen the Scribe and
[35:49] asiah the servant of the king saying go
[35:52] inquire of the Lord for me for them that
[35:55] are left in Israel and in Judah
[35:57] concerning the words of the book that is
[35:59] found for great is the Wrath of the Lord
[36:02] that is poured out upon us because of
[36:03] our fathers they have not kept the word
[36:06] of the Lord to do after all that is
[36:07] written in the book so the next few
[36:09] verses he did exactly what the Lord has
[36:11] always done he gave the word to the
[36:14] prophet amen and what did Josiah do is
[36:17] he inquired of the Lord through that
[36:19] Prophet glory and he says in verse 26
[36:21] and as for the king of Judah who sent
[36:23] you to inquire of the Lord so shall ye
[36:25] say unto them thus sayeth the Lord God
[36:27] of Israel concerning The Words which
[36:29] thou has heard because thy heart was
[36:32] tender and thou did humble thyself
[36:34] before God when thou heardest his words
[36:36] against this place and against the
[36:38] inhabitants thereof and humbled thyself
[36:40] before me and did rent my clothes and
[36:42] weep before me I have even heard thee
[36:45] also sayeth the Lord hallelujah behold I
[36:48] will gather thee to thy fathers and thou
[36:50] shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace
[36:52] neither shall thine eyes see all the
[36:55] evil that I will bring upon this place
[36:57] and upon the inhabitants of the same so
[37:00] they brought the king word again
[37:02] Hallelujah and the King stood verse 31
[37:04] and the King stood in his place and made
[37:06] a covenant before the Lord to walk after
[37:09] the Lord and to keep his Commandments
[37:10] and his testimonies and his statutes
[37:13] with all of his heart and with all of
[37:15] his soul to perform the words of the
[37:16] Covenant which are written in this book
[37:18] and he caused all that were present in
[37:21] Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it
[37:23] and the inhabit inhabitants of Jerusalem
[37:26] did according to the Covenant of God the
[37:27] God of their fathers and Josiah took all
[37:30] the Abominations out of the countries
[37:32] and that pertained to the children of
[37:34] Israel and made all that were present in
[37:36] Israel to serve even to serve the Lord
[37:39] their God all his days they departed not
[37:42] from following the Lord the god of their
[37:44] fathers amen I'd like to take a thought
[37:46] this morning on leadership and
[37:48] restoration let's just go before the
[37:49] Lord Heavenly Father we thank you for
[37:51] the reading of your word this morning
[37:52] Father how I can already feel your
[37:54] presence here and I'm so grateful for it
[37:55] Lord Jesus I pray that you'd anoint the
[37:57] words anoint the hearers Lord to hear
[37:59] and to receive your word this morning
[38:01] Father speak to us Lord God in a Divine
[38:03] way I ask Lord come and just show
[38:05] yourself to us Lord God we humble
[38:07] ourselves before you just like Josiah
[38:09] did Lord we're inquiring of you Lord God
[38:11] the same way Lord God that you've always
[38:13] had it done father we look to you father
[38:16] the the king of the world this morning
[38:17] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[38:20] God bless you this morning as you take
[38:22] your
[38:23] seats last time we spoke here we touched
[38:26] on on there that first scripture I I
[38:28] turned to which I would like to think as
[38:31] Joshua's last sermon Amen to the people
[38:33] of Israel there from our opening text
[38:35] and this would be his final declaration
[38:38] some of his final words to all those
[38:40] that had followed him into the promised
[38:43] land I believe that Joshua was
[38:47] begin Wasing people he began to see the
[38:50] idol worship to raise up in their
[38:53] households he saw how they were
[38:55] compromising on the words of the Lord so
[38:57] he was compelled to declare those words
[38:59] choose you this day whom You Shall Serve
[39:03] and he says if you choose this God if
[39:05] you choose God the one who delivered you
[39:07] and your fathers out of that land then
[39:09] you need to do it and serve him in
[39:11] sincerity and in truth amen it had to be
[39:14] the duality of serving him in sincerity
[39:17] and serving him in truth Amen brother
[39:20] random actually takes that scripture
[39:21] there in Joshua 24 and he uses it to
[39:24] preach a text sermon in 1962
[39:27] the conflict between God and Satan amen
[39:30] and he began to show the ways in which
[39:33] God chose to fight against the enemy and
[39:36] the tactics the devil chose to fight
[39:39] against the family of God all throughout
[39:41] the ages amen from the beginning even
[39:44] before the beginning God knew exactly
[39:47] how he was going to choose to fight
[39:49] against his family amen he knew every
[39:52] tactic that the enemy would ever use
[39:54] amen and brother bandham says that
[39:55] because he knew the and he knew how he
[39:58] was going to fight he fortified his
[40:00] family with the atomic weapon of weapons
[40:03] Hallelujah he chose the very best thing
[40:06] that he could have ever chose and that
[40:07] was his word amen the infinite God chose
[40:11] the infinite word amen that's why it's
[40:13] so vital that we stand upon every word
[40:16] of God Amen and we don't look at
[40:19] anything Through The Eyes of modern
[40:21] Theory or Through The Eyes of modern
[40:23] culture amen because God chose this word
[40:27] and with that word we see him defeat the
[40:29] enemy every place in every situation
[40:32] Hallelujah in every circumstance all
[40:35] throughout the ages amen but it cannot
[40:37] be a fraction of the word or even what
[40:40] he was saying this morning it cannot be
[40:43] 99% it can't be done with sincerity
[40:46] alone it has to be with the truth you've
[40:49] got to have the unadulterated word of
[40:52] God Amen a few weeks ago in our Sunday
[40:54] school we were showing how Cain with a
[40:56] true sincerity in his heart he had took
[40:59] a version of the word amen and he tried
[41:02] to do something without having the right
[41:05] Revelation amen and look at what it led
[41:07] to amen it shattered a family's life it
[41:11] caused a man to shed blood the first
[41:13] time in history it led to a mother and a
[41:15] father having to grieve for their child
[41:17] for the first time in history amen you
[41:21] you know I think sometimes people read
[41:22] about Cain and they think he was this no
[41:25] horrible this no good heathen but that's
[41:27] not what the scripture says amen he was
[41:29] a follower of God he worshiped God he
[41:33] went to church brother bham said he
[41:34] built an altar the same as Abel did but
[41:38] it was contrary to the line and Order of
[41:41] God's word it was contrary to the the
[41:43] design that God had set in order amen
[41:46] and anything contrary to that word
[41:49] proves what it is by the evidence amen
[41:51] it proves by what it produces amen when
[41:55] Cain was offering his his sacrificed on
[41:57] the altar it looked a whole lot better
[41:59] than Abel's amen and the natural eyes
[42:02] could behold the beauty and its
[42:04] sincerity but its evidence came a few
[42:07] verses later amen because the fruition
[42:09] was it was murder and hate amen and
[42:12] death and
[42:14] sorrow the prophet says this in 1962 he
[42:17] says the conflict between God and Satan
[42:19] he says Satan had has his system at work
[42:21] again to get people to misbelieve the
[42:24] word of God Amen
[42:27] Satan's wrong way of worship like Cain
[42:30] and like balam they were very religious
[42:32] Cain was religious he brought he bought
[42:34] brought an altar he made an offer and
[42:36] frankly Cain was more religious than
[42:38] Abel he sure was he done more for the
[42:40] Lord than Abel but but Abel came in the
[42:44] way of the Lord that's all he done more
[42:47] he built a great denomination he built a
[42:49] great thing a great Christian Heritage
[42:51] but you see he come in the wrong way and
[42:53] it wasn't received now wrong it was
[42:56] contrary to the word amen and brother
[42:58] Brenham begins to contrast balum that
[43:01] that old Prophet there in the Old
[43:02] Testament that had sold out for money
[43:04] and for popularity and he says you know
[43:06] balum was just as religious as Moses was
[43:10] he came with the same sacrifice the same
[43:12] clean animals everything and he prayed
[43:14] to the same God you you start to go read
[43:16] about balum and everything that God does
[43:18] it seems that he's doing the right thing
[43:20] but he's not in the line and Order of
[43:22] God's word because he says you need to
[43:24] bless my people and this man that you're
[43:26] serving he's trying to curse my people
[43:28] and the fruition came versus later when
[43:31] balum was found on the enemy's territory
[43:33] when he was dead because he stayed on
[43:36] the wrong grounds hallelujah it's so
[43:38] important where you stand on the word of
[43:41] God hallelujah and I want you to notice
[43:44] this morning he says the word won't mix
[43:48] with modern Theory see you can't have
[43:50] modern Theory now in closing listen
[43:52] close the word won't mix with any modern
[43:55] Theory you can't have Theory and and the
[43:57] word you've got to have the word or the
[44:00] theory now which are you going to
[44:02] believe he begins to say if the if the
[44:04] Bible teaches baptism in the name of
[44:06] Jesus Christ and the church says Father
[44:08] and Son and Holy Ghost then who are you
[44:10] going to believe if Jesus says be born
[44:12] again and the church says come join a
[44:14] church now what are you going to believe
[44:15] if Jesus says these find shall signs
[44:17] shall follow them that believe and the
[44:19] church says you're just a good member
[44:21] who are you going to believe Hallelujah
[44:23] and he skipping down he says now
[44:24] Christians stay behind the word of God
[44:27] amen yes sir wrong way of life trying to
[44:30] mix it today today they take these women
[44:33] that's dressed any way they take these
[44:34] men if they smoke or drink or anything
[44:36] else and they make them deacons and so
[44:38] forth in the churches even pastors dress
[44:40] women any way they want to dress and
[44:42] bring them in and make them sisters in
[44:44] the church don't you ever try to get to
[44:46] heaven like that it won't mix with
[44:49] modern Theory Hallelujah modern Theory
[44:52] and modern culture would teach that it
[44:54] doesn't matter the way that men and
[44:56] women dress the way that we act the
[44:58] things that we associate with they would
[45:00] say that it's oldfashioned for a woman
[45:02] not to cut her hair or to not wear pants
[45:04] but according to God's infinite word
[45:07] amen it does matter because it's in his
[45:09] word and he chose that thing to fight
[45:12] the enemy all down Through the Ages amen
[45:15] Holiness living and standards have
[45:17] always been a part of God's word amen
[45:20] and we know as Believers of God's word
[45:23] we won't take even a slight compromise
[45:25] on that thing amen because because we
[45:27] know what the evidence of that thing is
[45:29] amen we know what the evidence of
[45:31] compromising is you live a sincere life
[45:33] you love the Lord so did Cain but he
[45:36] died he died and he didn't have God on
[45:39] his side because he wasn't in the line
[45:41] of order of God's
[45:43] word and just because the enemy has had
[45:46] 6,000 years to pervert that idea and
[45:49] raise up this popular culture that says
[45:52] otherwise that doesn't mean that we
[45:53] accept any other version of God's word
[45:56] amen
[45:57] if the Christian world would just look
[45:59] at these biblical truths without the
[46:01] lens the modern lens of the popular
[46:04] culture that we live in today maybe they
[46:06] would have isav to see maybe they would
[46:09] understand these things maybe they
[46:10] wouldn't be foreign Concepts they're not
[46:13] foreign Concepts to us because we
[46:15] believe God's word we believe everything
[46:17] he says amen and we want in our hearts
[46:20] to follow every word of God
[46:24] Amen Satan the deform you know it's
[46:27] always been God's way to transform your
[46:30] life amen we read you know Romans 12 it
[46:32] says that Bible says transformed by the
[46:34] renewing of your mind but it's always
[46:36] been Satan's way to try to deform that
[46:38] thing
[46:39] Amen to get us to conform to the ways of
[46:42] the world from the very beginning of all
[46:44] things he set it up in his mind to have
[46:46] sons and daughters walk contrary to the
[46:49] word of God and deform God's perfect way
[46:52] you know and what can happen many times
[46:54] saints of God is you let the enemy into
[46:57] into your mind and it deforms your
[46:59] growth real true Sons and Daughters of
[47:02] God born again of the spirit of God but
[47:04] you leted something in your mind you
[47:06] don't take that thought captive and then
[47:08] it begins to grow and it deforms your
[47:10] growth as a Believer there's still
[47:13] trying to grow brother bom says they're
[47:15] still a seed of God and they think that
[47:17] they're maturing in the word but all the
[47:19] time Satan has got in their mind
[47:21] somewhere amen and brother Brenham says
[47:23] it like this in God's power to transform
[47:25] he says now and we are still in the
[47:27] image of God and but some are so
[47:30] deformed as sons of God that walk
[47:33] contrary to his word and to the way that
[47:35] he had us and provided for us to walk
[47:38] setting something the world twists us
[47:41] all out of the way pull us close to it
[47:43] and away from the straight narrow strip
[47:45] that he planted Us in to be Sons and
[47:48] Daughters of God sin has done this evil
[47:51] thing to the Sons and Daughters of God
[47:54] and he begins to just start talking
[47:55] about how when he was a game and he
[47:57] would go and he'd walk in the in in in
[47:59] Indiana where there's a lot of corn
[48:01] fields and and if he would watch a
[48:03] branch and the branch would fall on a
[48:05] stock of corn and that stock of corn
[48:07] would try to grow but it was growing in
[48:09] a deformed way amen and it was still
[48:11] trying to grow and brother Brena makes
[48:14] the contrast between believers who what
[48:16] they have something in their life a
[48:17] branch grows you know something happens
[48:20] in your life and you're still trying to
[48:21] grow but you're growing in a deformed
[48:23] way you need to go back to whatever that
[48:25] thing is and you need rid that thing of
[48:27] your life you need to find out whatever
[48:29] it is you say God if I don't know what
[48:31] it is but my life is in ay then discern
[48:34] my heart because that's what he can do
[48:36] he can show you exactly where you're out
[48:38] of the
[48:41] word Satan will get you to compromise on
[48:44] some part of the word no matter how
[48:46] small and then we think we're growing
[48:48] amen but until you get back into
[48:51] cater that straight amen until whatever
[48:55] is hindering its growth is removed
[48:57] until whatever area of your life is back
[48:59] in alignment with God you know it's not
[49:02] it's not popular to preach these things
[49:04] you know for families to have Holiness
[49:06] standards but we don't stand with the
[49:08] Fashions and the families of the world
[49:10] Amen and men and women that are truly
[49:13] Born Again of the spirit of God that's
[49:15] the only kind of water they want to
[49:16] drink amen that's the only kind of water
[49:18] I want to drink I want to drink the
[49:20] Waters of the water of life amen I want
[49:22] someone to come up in here and tell me
[49:24] how I need to live and how I need to act
[49:26] because I know that's how I'm going to
[49:28] make a Rapture and that's how God is
[49:30] going to get his family to where it
[49:31] needs to be because he he chose this way
[49:34] amen he chose prophets to work through
[49:37] he chose ministers amen he chose these
[49:39] things so I want to listen to whatever
[49:41] God has chosen amen
[49:44] hallelujah you know it's against modern
[49:47] Theory to say that it's it's a man's
[49:49] duty to lead the home amen but sisters
[49:51] that have a true experience with God
[49:54] want nothing less than that amen because
[49:56] they know that that's God's Perfect
[49:58] Design and they know that if the husband
[50:01] is truly being led by Christ that he'll
[50:03] love and cherish her just like God loves
[50:06] and cherishes the church Hallelujah and
[50:09] it'll be in her heart to want to follow
[50:11] that kind of leadership amen and once
[50:13] you understand the whole picture you
[50:15] wouldn't want anything less than God's
[50:18] design on it amen I wouldn't want
[50:20] anything less than the way God had
[50:22] intended it because he sees my future I
[50:24] don't amen he sees the things I'm going
[50:26] to face I don't he knows that if I'm out
[50:29] of line in order of God's word then down
[50:31] the road if I'm facing the enemy and I'm
[50:33] not in line with this then he can't help
[50:35] me because he needs to be in line and
[50:37] order with God's word that's right
[50:45] Hallelujah Brothers amen we need to make
[50:48] sure Christ is the one that's leading Us
[50:51] in every decision that we make the
[50:53] moment that you start trying to lead
[50:55] yourselves or lead your family without
[50:58] the headship of Christ you're going to
[51:00] ruin the whole design amen you want to

[51:34] family God's design is always perfect
[51:40] amen I know I know these are these are
[51:42] Elementary Concepts but I believe it's
[51:44] important to drive these things down to
[51:46] make sure that they're not forgotten
[51:48] Concepts you know just because it's not
[51:51] the popular thing anymore we still stand
[51:53] with God's word no matter how
[51:55] oldfashioned it gets amen young people

[52:09] at the age of eight he began Josiah
[52:11] began uh taking he took leadership of
[52:13] the kingdom and he set his heart toward
[52:16] God at a young age then at the age of 16
[52:18] he started breaking down those false
[52:20] altars and he had he followed the
[52:23] footsteps you know if he followed the
[52:24] footsteps of his natural father he would
[52:27] have been ruined he would have died in
[52:29] the same sin that they died in but he
[52:31] took a stand against popular culture at
[52:34] a young age amen and you watch how
[52:37] throughout his whole Kingdom that the
[52:39] chapter 34 all the way to the end of his
[52:41] kingdom everybody in that kingdom was

[53:02] your road you're going to find yourself
[53:03] in the line in order of God's word and
[53:05] he'll take you all the way with him
[53:08] Hallelujah you know Israel had gotten to
[53:12] such a point in their society you know
[53:14] from the evil of people that the Bible
[53:17] says that even sodomites felt
[53:19] comfortable enough living next to the
[53:23] house of the Lord you go read the first
[53:25] part of the book of 2 Chronicles you
[53:27] know this was this was actually at the
[53:29] start of it was such a high point in
[53:31] Israel's time you know Solomon was King
[53:33] and under under his headship the Temple
[53:36] of the Lord had finished its
[53:37] construction and the fifth chapter
[53:39] begins describing the events that took
[53:41] place while they were dedicating the
[53:43] temple the glory of God in 2 Chronicles
[53:45] 5:13 it says it came to pass as the
[53:47] trumpeters and singers were as one to
[53:49] make one sound to be heard in praising
[53:51] and thanking the lord when they lifted
[53:53] up their voice and trumpets and symbols
[53:55] and instruments of music music and
[53:56] praise the Lord saying for he is good
[53:58] for his mercy endureth forever that then
[54:02] the house was filled with the cloud even
[54:04] the house of the Lord the presence of
[54:06] the Lord after the after the dedication
[54:08] of the temple was so incredible it says
[54:11] so much that that the priest could not
[54:13] even stand to minister by reason of the
[54:16] cloud for the glory of the Lord had
[54:18] filled the house they couldn't even
[54:21] stand have you ever been in a in a
[54:23] situation where the presence of the Lord
[54:25] is so strong in your life you know he's
[54:27] doing something you can't even stand in
[54:29] that presence for the place you're
[54:31] standing on his Holy Ground they
[54:33] couldn't even stand amen and yet just a
[54:35] few Generations later when Josiah took
[54:39] leadership he began sanctifying the land
[54:42] sodomites were living in the kingdom and
[54:44] they were not even just living in the
[54:45] Kingdom they had gotten so comfortable
[54:47] living in the kingdom it says the Bible
[54:49] says that they encamped next to the
[54:51] house of the Lord you know and if you go
[54:54] and read those the books of the Kings
[54:55] and the Chronicles
[54:57] even in the succession of the Kings
[54:59] during those time that that the ones
[55:01] that did right in the sight of the Lord
[55:03] the Bible says the high places were
[55:05] still not taken out of Israel saints of
[55:08] God that's why you can't ever let the
[55:09] fire of God die in your life you've got
[55:13] to have a fresh Revival every single day

[55:17] of compromise that don't seem like such
[55:19] a big deal now there seeds and the
[55:22] longer you let a seed grow the more
[55:24] evidence it brings of what going to
[55:26] sprout on the inside of that thing amen
[55:29] you start Towing the line of Holiness in
[55:30] your life it shows what seed you're
[55:32] watering you start CH Towing the line
[55:34] and your church attendons you start
[55:36] Towing the line and letting the Fashions
[55:37] of the world in your life you watch the
[55:39] fruit of that seed and you know in this
[55:41] situation it took generations of Filth
[55:45] and sin but saints of God it doesn't
[55:47] take that long today we live in Satan's
[55:49] Eden you make a choice and a decision
[55:51] and if it's not in line and order with
[55:53] God's word you watch that seed begin to
[55:55] grow it's going to rapidly go and before
[55:58] you know it you're in this
[55:59] conglomeration of sin that you know that
[56:01] only God can take you out of this
[56:06] place you let what happened you you let
[56:08] the enemy in your mind Start begin
[56:10] fellowship with your
[56:12] thoughts those seeds grow you know when
[56:16] Josiah began seeking after the Lord he
[56:19] chose the harder way I love that quote
[56:22] when brother brandham he was given that
[56:24] prophecy it says because you chose the
[56:26] harder
[56:28] way he says it in the true Easter SE
[56:30] much of Heaven awaits you because thou
[56:32] has chosen the Narrow Path the harder
[56:35] way thou has not thou has walked of your
[56:37] own choosing now here the man watch How
[56:39] It's
[56:40] wrote It's wrote in forign words thou
[56:42] has picked the correct and precise deis
[56:45] decision and it is my way that's the way
[56:49] I want saints of God I want his way amen
[56:53] you know we've chosen the way with the
[56:55] Lord's despised Fe few I fixed it up
[56:57] with Jesus a long time ago Hallelujah
[57:00] and you know when you start to take
[57:02] sides with God you aren't declaring a
[57:05] path of least resistance you've got to
[57:07] fight your way there amen life living a
[57:10] life as an overcomer doesn't just happen
[57:12] overnight God takes you through seasons
[57:14] and growth and maturing but at every
[57:16] juncture you can look back and you can
[57:18] say praise the Lord because I watch the
[57:20] Lord do this in my life and that in my
[57:22] life I had situations that I know I
[57:24] needed to correct but by God's grace I
[57:27] made it through amen even in situations
[57:29] I didn't know how to correct but I gave
[57:31] it to the Lord and now I can watch how
[57:33] that thing was just completely abolished
[57:36] because God when God's hands are in it
[57:38] when you let God's hands be in control
[57:40] he's able to take those things which are
[57:43] broken those crooked paths and he's able
[57:45] to straighten them out amen but first
[57:48] you've got to Humble yourselves before
[57:49] God you got to own up to your mistake
[57:51] you got to say God I'm sorry for how I'm
[57:54] living but I don't want to be living
[57:55] this anymore I want you to be ruling my
[57:59] life I want you to be the one leading me
[58:01] every decision I make and he's going to
[58:03] start taking you to places that you
[58:05] didn't even know that you could go
[58:08] Hallelujah you just got to take a stand
[58:10] for God then you watch him do only what
[58:13] he can do you know even when you're
[58:15] faced with difficult decisions Saints
[58:17] you're sometimes you're faced with a
[58:19] pile of ruins when Joshua recognized
[58:22] that the the lack of Jehovah God in his
[58:25] kingdom he was faced with a hard Choice
[58:28] confront it headon and tear down these
[58:30] strongholds or continue down the easy
[58:33] path the path of least resistance and it
[58:36] was at that time that Joshua began to
[58:39] purge the idols and the carved images as
[58:42] a teenager saints of God he began to do
[58:44] these things and I want you to catch
[58:47] what happens at the beginning after he
[58:50] started pursuing the Lord God began
[58:52] doing a larger work amen he had a word
[58:56] that he was preserving the whole time
[58:58] amen the the the book of the law of
[59:00] Moses he was preserving that thing the
[59:02] whole time and he always had a plan it
[59:05] was prophesied 300 years before this
[59:07] that Josiah would come and that he would
[59:09] Reign he had a plan to restore he has a
[59:12] plan to restore your life he has a plan
[59:14] to restore those bad decisions you made
[59:16] you just got to humble yourself before
[59:18] God you just got to commit it to him
[59:19] amen the Bible says that he humbled
[59:23] himself before the Lord
[59:27] it doesn't matter how many years that
[59:29] the devil has
[59:32] corrupted amen while they were
[59:34] rebuilding the priest they found this
[59:38] book I just want to say SS of God it
[59:41] doesn't matter how far you've gone in
[59:43] your life amen it doesn't matter the
[59:45] wreckage there's a seed on the inside of
[59:48] your soul God has a plan of restoration
[59:51] and he can do it amen I want you to have
[59:53] confidence in that you just you just got
[59:56] to be willing to stand on the word amen
[59:59] he chose the harder way you know we
[1:00:02] serve a God in the restoring business
[1:00:04] you know all all the years there that
[1:00:06] the Bible says the Locust ate all the
[1:00:07] years the Palmer worm ate all the years
[1:00:09] the cankerworm all the years the
[1:00:10] caterpillar you know and we remember
[1:00:12] when the prophet teaches us that in so
[1:00:14] many places that that's the same insect
[1:00:16] just in four stages amen it's the same
[1:00:18] devil amen it's the same enemy that
[1:00:20] Josiah had to fight way back then he's
[1:00:23] the same liar that he is today and it's
[1:00:25] the devil that came in in different
[1:00:27] coats amen dressed a little differently
[1:00:29] and it's the same thing today presenting
[1:00:32] the church with things that look so
[1:00:33] appealing the same thing he did with
[1:00:36] Cain amen Jesus said that they would
[1:00:38] have the same anointing and the prophet
[1:00:40] taught us in the church age book that
[1:00:41] they would preach what seemed to be the
[1:00:43] same thing we preach the churches would
[1:00:45] still preach salvation through Jesus
[1:00:48] Christ they would preach the power of
[1:00:49] God but I want you to notice this so did
[1:00:52] judas's scariot amen and because they
[1:00:54] are of the wrong seed it produces the
[1:00:57] wrong thing you know Cain had a sincere
[1:01:00] heart with a part of the true word but
[1:01:02] it produced death and when Josiah heard
[1:01:05] the words of the book of the law and the
[1:01:07] Declarations it made that God would pour
[1:01:09] out his wrath upon the land it said that
[1:01:12] because Israel has forsaken me like they
[1:01:15] promised they would never do I will
[1:01:17] bring evil Upon This
[1:01:20] Place sometimes you hear those words and
[1:01:23] man Lord oh because the wrath of God the
[1:01:25] judge judgement of God isn't always what
[1:01:28] people like to
[1:01:29] hear but they had caused it from a
[1:01:32] lifestyle that they chose when they
[1:01:35] heard Joshua's message and they didn't
[1:01:38] apply it to their lives and then
[1:01:40] generation after generation they began
[1:01:43] to Let the Fire Die amen but you have to
[1:01:46] catch Josiah's attitude here it says
[1:01:48] that he humbled himself to the Lord and
[1:01:50] inquired of the Lord through the way God
[1:01:53] always chose to do it amen a prophet I'm
[1:01:55] so grateful that we have a prophet of
[1:01:57] this day that we can inquire any time we
[1:02:00] need when when we live in the most
[1:02:01] corrupted of times in the worst of days
[1:02:04] amen we have the words of God's
[1:02:05] messenger that we can look to no matter
[1:02:08] how many people thought he was too harsh
[1:02:10] or too hard on people get too involved
[1:02:12] in people's life that's the kind of
[1:02:14] gospel that I want preached amen I want
[1:02:16] something that convicts me that digs
[1:02:18] into my life in the way that I dress and
[1:02:20] the way that I live because I know those
[1:02:22] things matter to God Joshua Jos inquired
[1:02:26] of the Lord amen and God spoke and told
[1:02:30] Josiah because thy heart was tender
[1:02:32] before me and thou humbles thyself
[1:02:34] before me my brother my think of sister
[1:02:37] think of it now today God was going to
[1:02:39] pour out his wrath there was so much
[1:02:41] evil throughout the land that God
[1:02:43] couldn't even stand it but one man a
[1:02:46] leader a true leader raised up in the
[1:02:48] midst of all of it and God said because
[1:02:50] of the Purity and the humility of this
[1:02:52] man's heart all the things that will
[1:02:55] come to pass your eyes won't behold it
[1:02:59] oh my because you stood for my word even
[1:03:01] when it was hard you and everybody in
[1:03:04] your kingdom during your Reign won't
[1:03:06] endure my wrath glory to God stand upon
[1:03:10] the word means something friends it's
[1:03:13] not just another denomination all those
[1:03:15] years the enemy tried to destroy God's
[1:03:18] word Through The Years amen God
[1:03:20] preserved the word amen I'm talking
[1:03:22] about now in our day and now in the
[1:03:24] culmination of God's plan and all of it
[1:03:27] at the end he brought it back into
[1:03:29] restoration this message that we preach
[1:03:31] is Christ it's the second coming of
[1:03:33] almighty God and it's the same kind of
[1:03:35] restoration in our day amen it's this
[1:03:37] it's the Fulfillment of scripture and I
[1:03:39] stand up here to say it's not a time to
[1:03:42] compromise amen it's not a time to to
[1:03:44] tow the line of compromise it's a time
[1:03:47] to get every aspect of your life in line
[1:03:49] in order with God's word amen hallelujah
[1:03:56] Hallelujah now is a Time To Worship it's
[1:03:59] a time to stand for the truth of God's
[1:04:01] word in an evil
[1:04:03] day we're living so close to the End
[1:04:06] Amen this is this is it friends this is
[1:04:08] it young people now is a time to take a
[1:04:11] stand on the word that you've heard
[1:04:13] preached and I believe saints of God
[1:04:14] that anything that you're facing in your
[1:04:16] life God is God is more than able to do
[1:04:19] it he can restore Health in your in your
[1:04:21] body he can restore families he can
[1:04:23] restore all the years that the devil has
[1:04:25] destroyed you just turn your heart
[1:04:27] towards his word amen you you just make
[1:04:30] the Declaration right now and you watch
[1:04:32] God start to make these changes in your
[1:04:34] life I'm a witness this morning I've had
[1:04:36] things that came up in my life I didn't
[1:04:38] know how to do it I didn't know where to
[1:04:39] go with it but I was like Lord I need
[1:04:41] this changed and now I can look back on
[1:04:43] that situation and say it's just the
[1:04:45] grace of God that picked that thing up
[1:04:47] and was able to mend it and break it to
[1:04:50] to break me of it amen and now I can
[1:04:52] look and I can just say thanks be to God
[1:04:54] Amen takes the right attitude though
[1:04:57] amen Jo Joshua Josiah approached God in
[1:05:00] pure humility said I know this area of
[1:05:03] my life I know this area of my kingdom
[1:05:05] needs fixed and I've got to commit it to
[1:05:07] you amen sometimes I know it can feel
[1:05:10] difficult especially when you've got a
[1:05:12] family and you got kids and you've got
[1:05:13] areas that have gone years and years
[1:05:16] without God being in the center of it
[1:05:18] amen but sometimes he's just looking for
[1:05:20] you to take ownership of it amen just
[1:05:22] take ownership of your faults you know
[1:05:24] we live in a world today where everybody
[1:05:26] has somebody to blame for what's wrong
[1:05:28] in their life amen we live in a world
[1:05:31] where you know everything is is somebody
[1:05:33] else's fault amen don't buy into that
[1:05:35] modern theory of weakness amen it's a
[1:05:38] weak attitude that breeds the wrong
[1:05:40] thing in your life God wants men and
[1:05:42] women to take ownership of their wrongs
[1:05:45] amen maybe another person did wrong you
[1:05:47] maybe a church did wrong you maybe a
[1:05:50] pastor a friend whatever it is take that
[1:05:52] thing to God right now amen Josiah took
[1:05:55] rulership of his kingdom amen and his
[1:05:58] father and his grandfather had ruled and
[1:06:01] they destroyed it with sin and years of
[1:06:03] wreckage and wrongdoings but his
[1:06:05] attitude didn't Express all the things
[1:06:07] that he had to fix amen his attitude was
[1:06:10] humble toward God lord I know there's a
[1:06:11] lot of things in my life that I need to
[1:06:13] fix I don't know how to do it but I know
[1:06:15] you can do it and he humbled his heart
[1:06:17] and God did just that
[1:06:21] Hallelujah he didn't stand up there and
[1:06:23] say well it was their fault that this
[1:06:24] happened or that happened happened amen
[1:06:26] you know sometimes we pick we do we pick
[1:06:28] up traits in our life because of traumas

[1:09:48] to

[1:09:52] Josiah there in the Kingdom the Feast of
[1:09:55] Passover you know we're familiar with
[1:09:57] this Feast that took place uh it was one
[1:09:59] of the things that Josiah actually
[1:10:01] brought back into yearly worship and
[1:10:04] this celebration it had been a a symbol
[1:10:07] just as a a minute here to show what it
[1:10:09] what it was it had been a symbol after
[1:10:11] The Exodus amen the Israelites had been
[1:10:14] living in bondage for so many years and
[1:10:16] God had be dealing with Moses and
[1:10:19] Pharaoh on his people slavery and in the
[1:10:21] midst of all those plagues and all those
[1:10:23] woes that God was bringing down on Egypt
[1:10:26] God had made a declaration he said this
[1:10:28] month shall be the beginning of months
[1:10:30] to you it was a new beginning for the
[1:10:32] people of Israel amen and God said his
[1:10:34] instruction to Moses was he said take a
[1:10:37] lamb each household without spot or
[1:10:40] blemish amen and kill it in the evening
[1:10:42] time and take the blood of that
[1:10:45] sacrifice and strike it on every
[1:10:47] doorpost and then take the Flesh in the
[1:10:49] night and roast it with fire see he was
[1:10:52] specific about his instructions and it's
[1:10:54] the same sacrifice today saints of God
[1:10:57] except you don't have to have a bloody
[1:10:58] lamb in anymore you you had the lamb and
[1:11:01] he shed his blood for you but you have
[1:11:03] to do the same thing amen you still have
[1:11:06] to Oly the same blood on your doorpost
[1:11:08] amen glory to God the new birth is our
[1:11:11] beginning of months amen for that new
[1:11:14] life but for that new life to take
[1:11:16] effect saints of God there first had to
[1:11:18] be a death and that lamb had to die
[1:11:21] that's right God said burn it burn the
[1:11:24] flesh with fire and eat it in haste it
[1:11:26] is the Lord's Passover so that's that's
[1:11:29] what the Passover was that was what it
[1:11:31] signified amen and he said God said for
[1:11:34] all those who have the blood applied to
[1:11:36] their homes I will pass over them but
[1:11:39] all those who wouldn't take the word
[1:11:41] that God had for them amen and all those
[1:11:44] who wouldn't listen and heed to the
[1:11:46] message of my Prophet Moses I will Smite
[1:11:49] and execute judgment on that household
[1:11:51] but when I see the blood I will pass
[1:11:54] over you you praise the name of the Lord
[1:11:57] it signifies the same thing today
[1:11:59] judgment is coming to strike the land
[1:12:01] God has to purge the leaven from this
[1:12:03] world all the sin and the corruption
[1:12:05] amen and in order for for for him to
[1:12:07] pass over it's got to be the blood I I
[1:12:10] hope you can catch that this morning
[1:12:11] Saints you've got to have the blood
[1:12:13] covering it's got to you've got to have
[1:12:15] Christ's blood represented in your life

[1:12:23] reality to you it can't be words on a
[1:12:26] page young people it can't just be you

[1:12:41] something that you display in your life

[1:12:51] amen and you could eat the you could eat
[1:12:53] the Passover you could do all those
[1:12:54] things but unless you got your hands
[1:12:56] dirty amen unless you dipped your hand
[1:12:59] in that blood and you started applying
[1:13:01] it to the doorpost then that then that
[1:13:04] Death Angel would still come into your
[1:13:05] house amen you could think you're living
[1:13:07] right but until you've given everything
[1:13:09] to God Amen you've got to have it on
[1:13:11] display in your life you've got to make
[1:13:13] Jesus Christ the center of every
[1:13:15] decision you make of every situation in
[1:13:17] your life and it's got to be on display
[1:13:19] amen the blood has to show on your
[1:13:22] doorpost amen hallelujah

[1:13:28] don't find yourself just believing the
[1:13:30] word amen it doesn't it doesn't matter
[1:13:33] how many times that you've uttered the
[1:13:34] words out of your mouth it doesn't
[1:13:36] matter how many times you've attended a
[1:13:37] church service it doesn't matter how
[1:13:39] many T times that you've said you love
[1:13:41] the Lord until you've made that a living
[1:13:43] reality in your soul until you've made
[1:13:45] it on your doorpost of your home and
[1:13:48] your life then it will not count because

[1:14:10] it a feast to the Lord throughout your
[1:14:12] Generations you shall keep it as a feast
[1:14:14] by an ordinance forever you see this
[1:14:17] this Monumental event became a memorial
[1:14:19] a memorial and that Passover feast was
[1:14:22] to be kept as a celebration through
[1:14:25] through all generations as an ordinance
[1:14:27] forever because it showed what did it
[1:14:29] show it showed the Liberty from bondage
[1:14:32] amen what is this Blood R represent it

[1:14:37] sin amen that's why it's got to be on

[1:14:46] what true Liberty is you don't even know
[1:14:48] what freedom is you don't even know what
[1:14:50] peace is until you've got Living God
[1:14:52] living down on the inside of your soul
[1:14:54] when you do you're going to have a peace
[1:14:56] that passes understanding you're going
[1:14:58] to have a love that you don't understand
[1:15:00] you're going to have Fellowship that you

[1:15:03] it's God's life in you representing
[1:15:06] himself Hallelujah glory to
[1:15:09] God don't be ashamed of it saints of God
[1:15:13] you know this is a time to celebrate it
[1:15:16] of any other time in history this is a
[1:15:19] time to celebrate because we've got a
[1:15:21] word we've got not just a partial part
[1:15:24] of amen they had a part of the word and
[1:15:27] then through every age a little bit more
[1:15:28] and a little bit more but we've got the
[1:15:30] whole thing we can go we can study the
[1:15:32] message maybe our our minds can't always
[1:15:34] grasp every single Doctrine and every
[1:15:36] single thing but God as you progress in
[1:15:39] your maturity as you continue to grow
[1:15:41] God will give you those Revelations that
[1:15:43] you feel like you're lacking in he's
[1:15:44] going to grow you in the areas that you
[1:15:46] feel like you need amen and God is able
[1:15:48] to do it through this word through the
[1:15:50] message of this hour glory to God
[1:15:53] hallelujah
[1:15:56] don't be ashamed of the word for your
[1:15:58] day this is life Hallelujah and this
[1:16:02] Passover feast it was supposed to be a
[1:16:05] memorial passed down from generation to
[1:16:07] generation it was a remembrance amen but
[1:16:11] what you start to see is you through the
[1:16:13] years as more Generations rose up that
[1:16:16] that fire dwindled they didn't always
[1:16:19] keep the feast you know and just to type
[1:16:21] Our Lives they had ups and downs in the
[1:16:23] Kingdom they had they had highs and they
[1:16:25] had lows amen they had a time of
[1:16:27] prosperity in the word then there was
[1:16:29] times of restoration you know we see all
[1:16:31] through the kingdom reign of David and
[1:16:33] we read about Solomon and the glory of
[1:16:35] the Lord filling the temple and wow it
[1:16:37] was just such an incredible thing the
[1:16:39] glory of the Lord in the temple but then
[1:16:41] when you come to the time of Josiah the
[1:16:43] Passover feast had somehow lost it its
[1:16:46] place in the Kingdom amen the the point
[1:16:48] of the Celebration The Feast every year
[1:16:50] so that it was never to be forgotten it
[1:16:53] was a remembrance it was a Memorial amen
[1:16:56] but the problem was that even though
[1:16:57] often times it was celebrated you can
[1:17:00] watch how it start to lose its spark it
[1:17:02] was supposed to be a time that the older
[1:17:05] ones would tell the younger ones all
[1:17:06] these incredible acts that the Lord had
[1:17:08] done in their life you know I watched
[1:17:10] the Red Sea split you know I watch be
[1:17:12] delivered in all these miraculous ways I
[1:17:14] watch the woes I watch the plagues come
[1:17:16] but God delivered me amen and now I'm
[1:17:18] going to show you that God is a living
[1:17:20] reality that's what we are to do to our
[1:17:22] young people that's what we are to do to
[1:17:24] our kids to show them that God is a
[1:17:26] living reality he didn't just come in
[1:17:28] and and have me start dressing
[1:17:30] differently and acting differently and
[1:17:32] not going to certain places he came to
[1:17:34] live on the inside of my soul and now
[1:17:36] I've got fellowship with a creator that
[1:17:38] I couldn't even understand before but
[1:17:40] now I somehow understand it and I can't
[1:17:42] always explain it but I know it's real
[1:17:46] hallelujah it's a living reality in your
[1:17:48] life saints of God Amen it's got to be a
[1:17:51] living reality it can't be a dead word

[1:17:56] giveth life
[1:17:59] hallelujah it's it's not just going to
[1:18:01] church it's not just it's not just
[1:18:04] living right it's so far be beyond that
[1:18:07] I don't I don't want we can't let the
[1:18:09] the things of God become common to us
[1:18:11] amen you know the prophet said every
[1:18:13] generation has a chance at its own
[1:18:15] Revival and I believe we as Believers
[1:18:18] living so close to the end we ought to
[1:18:20] be zealous for the things of God I want
[1:18:22] I want my kids to see me have the joy of
[1:18:25] the of the Holy Ghost I want them to see
[1:18:27] the power of God in my life I want them
[1:18:29] to notice how God is molding me and
[1:18:31] shaping me I want them to notice that
[1:18:33] maybe dad did wrong but dad's sorry amen
[1:18:36] I want that I want my wife to know yeah
[1:18:38] B I messed up and I'm sorry but God's
[1:18:40] changing me I don't want to be like that

[1:18:44] to glory amen let the God let God mold
[1:18:47] your life amen those little things
[1:18:50] despise not the day of small things God
[1:18:52] is doing things in your life whether you
[1:18:54] recognize it or not God is moving in
[1:18:56] your life every single day
[1:18:59] amen and it's our duty to keep a flame
[1:19:03] when we pass that on
[1:19:07] Amen Joshua inquired of the Lord and he
[1:19:10] said he said I want this fire rekindled
[1:19:13] in my in my kingdom I believe that's
[1:19:15] what every church service is an
[1:19:17] opportunity to do every day is an
[1:19:19] opportunity to do to pursue God to study
[1:19:22] this message you know studying this
[1:19:24] message is exciting to me you know I
[1:19:26] believe it should be like that you know
[1:19:27] when I finish a sermon or a series my my
[1:19:29] cousin and I were always fellowshipping
[1:19:31] on what are we going to listen to next
[1:19:32] what series are we going to go through

[1:20:08] what he has to say to you you know and I
[1:20:11] don't want this to be this doesn't come
[1:20:12] off as a rebuke but you know if the only
[1:20:15] time you hear a quote is when you come
[1:20:16] to church I believe something is wrong
[1:20:18] and I believe we need to check our life
[1:20:20] you got to revive the word in your life
[1:20:22] seek after God and I promise if you
[1:20:24] don't have that desire seek after God be
[1:20:27] sincere about it say Lord I want that
[1:20:29] desire I want that kind of zeal in my
[1:20:31] life amen and you know what's going to
[1:20:33] happen next you know it might not be
[1:20:34] exactly what you think it would be
[1:20:36] bargained for amen he might start
[1:20:38] convicting you to purge things in your
[1:20:40] life he might start convicting you to
[1:20:41] take those High those high places out
[1:20:44] amen oh but you know in even in areas
[1:20:48] that you wouldn't even classify his sin
[1:20:50] he starts to dig in those things amen he
[1:20:52] starts to maybe Purge your busy
[1:20:55] schedules Paul wrote mean all things are
[1:20:57] expedient but are all I mean all things
[1:20:59] are lawful but are all things expedient
[1:21:01] there could be something in your life
[1:21:02] that may not be unlawful but if it's
[1:21:04] taking your time away from the Lord
[1:21:06] Jesus if it's taking away your time from
[1:21:07] the fellowship with the Creator then get
[1:21:10] rid of it or ask the Lord maybe to give
[1:21:13] you Temperance in that thing we need to
[1:21:14] have Temperance in all things amen glory
[1:21:17] to
[1:21:18] God because what's happening is is
[1:21:20] you're making an idol out of that thing
[1:21:23] amen and God has set in order a set a
[1:21:27] series of channels to work through amen
[1:21:30] and a magnetic tape is one of those
[1:21:32] channels amen Ministry is one of those
[1:21:34] channels but Magnetic Tape is also and
[1:21:38] now we don't have it on Magnetic Tape
[1:21:39] it's on these fancy things but that's
[1:21:41] the way the the voice of a prophet to
[1:21:43] you amen you know and what's so amazing
[1:21:46] about God and the way that he does
[1:21:48] things in your life it he will always
[1:21:50] exceed your thinking on that subject
[1:21:53] amen the Bible says ask and you shall
[1:21:55] receive that your joy may be full It
[1:21:57] also says that God is able to do
[1:21:59] exceedingly abundantly all that you
[1:22:00] could ask or think so what happens is as
[1:22:02] you start putting God first in every
[1:22:05] facet of your life you're going to start
[1:22:06] reaping the benefits of that Harvest
[1:22:08] amen and it might start it might take a
[1:22:10] little bit of time but God will exceed
[1:22:12] your expectation amen Josiah started
[1:22:15] restoring things in the Kingdom He
[1:22:17] restored Temple worship he burnt the
[1:22:19] bones of the false prophets and the
[1:22:21] false priests he tore down those Idol
[1:22:22] things he kicked out all the sin and God
[1:22:25] was so pleased with what he did I think
[1:22:27] we can sometimes Overlook some of these
[1:22:29] simple things in in scripture but God's
[1:22:31] word is Rich Amen in the next chapter in
[1:22:34] verse 18 the Bible says that there was
[1:22:36] no Passover like that to kept in the
[1:22:39] days of the uh in Israel from the days
[1:22:41] of Samuel of the Prophet neither did all
[1:22:44] the kings of Israel keep such a Passover
[1:22:47] as Josiah kept and the priests and the
[1:22:50] Levites and all Judah were present and
[1:22:52] the inhabitants this celebration
[1:22:55] this Memorial it took on a whole new
[1:22:57] meaning in the people of Israel amen
[1:22:59] they had lost their fire for God they
[1:23:01] forgot about the Deliverance that God
[1:23:03] had brought them through they remembered
[1:23:05] not the ways of the Lord but God raised
[1:23:07] up a man to restore the kingdom
[1:23:11] Hallelujah and the feast was celebrated
[1:23:13] like no other time in Israel in Israel's
[1:23:17] history you know and God doesn't just
[1:23:21] restore he makes new amen I believe God
[1:23:25] can renew the joy of your
[1:23:28] salvation I I believe that your Joys can
[1:23:30] be full I believe this should be a time
[1:23:33] of Celebration like never before in
[1:23:35] history because now more than ever we
[1:23:38] are closer to the coming of the Lord
[1:23:40] Jesus it could be tomorrow and every
[1:23:41] trial that you've ever faced every
[1:23:44] Temptation every test every tear you've
[1:23:46] ever cried every Brokenness will be made
[1:23:48] whole glory to God saints of God don't
[1:23:51] lose the Zeal of God Amen if you've if
[1:23:54] you you've never even if you feel like
[1:23:55] you've never had that kind of of of
[1:23:57] fervency in your life today is the day
[1:24:00] of change amen there's no time like the
[1:24:03] present time don't get so captivated by
[1:24:05] all the years of ruin that the devil has
[1:24:08] wre in your life and all the Havoc that
[1:24:10] he's caused in your life if Josiah would
[1:24:13] have looked at his undertaking he would
[1:24:15] have been so discouraged how am I ever
[1:24:17] going to purge all these things in the
[1:24:19] kingdom and sometimes we can look in our
[1:24:21] lives how could I ever change that and
[1:24:23] then it discourage you and then down the
[1:24:25] road you get another conviction and then
[1:24:27] you get discouraged don't look at the
[1:24:29] past look at what God is going to do in
[1:24:30] your future amen God can restore God can
[1:24:34] multiply God can change he can renew the
[1:24:37] joy of your salvation he can give you
[1:24:39] the peace and the joy all those things
[1:24:42] can be in abundance in your life
[1:24:47] Hallelujah his eyes weren't fixed on
[1:24:49] what what he could do or or any of those
[1:24:52] he was it was fixed on what God could do
[1:24:55] don't focus on what you can do I man I
[1:24:57] sure can't do a whole lot so I don't
[1:25:00] focus on what I can do I focus on what
[1:25:02] God can do amen don't look at your
[1:25:05] struggles with the wrong lens amen God
[1:25:08] is
[1:25:09] able you know sometimes you can look
[1:25:13] at a if members maybe in your family
[1:25:16] that it looks just completely helpless
[1:25:17] or you know all hope seems lost you know
[1:25:20] God works the best in those cases amen
[1:25:22] the chapter says I this just to
[1:25:24] encourage you this morning in 2
[1:25:26] Chronicles 352 and he says that he set
[1:25:28] priests in their charges and encouraged
[1:25:31] them to the service of the house of the
[1:25:34] Lord I want this to encourage us this
[1:25:35] morning whatever your position uh uh in
[1:25:38] the kingdom of God is you do it with
[1:25:40] Zeal you take whatever Place God has set
[1:25:42] for you to do it doesn't doesn't matter
[1:25:44] there's no big eyes and and little 's in
[1:25:46] God's kingdom he's looking for men and
[1:25:48] women to align themselves up with God's
[1:25:50] word now M no matter how outdated
[1:25:52] society makes it seem no matter how out
[1:25:54] of cater with the world it looks we
[1:25:57] aren't looking to please men and women
[1:26:00] we the Bible is God's Authority amen not
[1:26:03] what the modern world says about it we
[1:26:05] want the word I don't care how unpopular
[1:26:07] it is I want the truth of God's word
[1:26:12] amen glory to
[1:26:15] God Noah Noah kept on preaching it says
[1:26:20] until the days until the day the doors
[1:26:22] closed on the ark and you know brother
[1:26:24] Branda makes that uh argument in that
[1:26:26] sermon the conflict and he says Noah
[1:26:28] went in he followed the will for God in
[1:26:31] his day and God shut the door behind him
[1:26:33] but it didn't rain for seven
[1:26:35] days and you know maybe he says in this
[1:26:39] paragraph 181 of that sermon he says
[1:26:40] maybe some people the kind of halfway
[1:26:43] believed Noah might have went up there
[1:26:45] and stood around the ark and said you
[1:26:46] know what that old man might have been
[1:26:48] right we better stand here well then see
[1:26:51] then they seen a mistake
[1:26:54] God's prophets makes no mistakes God's
[1:26:57] word Can't Fail here Noah said now
[1:26:59] children of all you get around and
[1:27:01] you'll see the first Cloud that ever
[1:27:03] come in the sky it'll come over in the
[1:27:05] morning well the sun come up well maybe
[1:27:07] 9:00 we'll watch 9:00 10:00 11 o'clock
[1:27:10] he's watching he's showing the struggle
[1:27:12] of Noah to to say look we just go to we
[1:27:15] just got to hold out a little bit longer
[1:27:17] because God's word says it it's going to
[1:27:18] come to pass amen there would never been
[1:27:21] a cloud up here on the earth the prophet
[1:27:23] said amen but their job wasn't to try to
[1:27:25] prove some kind of scientific theory
[1:27:28] their job was to prepare a vessel amen
[1:27:30] and they listened to God they prepared
[1:27:32] The Vessel and the culmination of that
[1:27:35] word from God was not fulfilled until
[1:27:39] the first raindrop from Heaven came
[1:27:41] dripping down Hallelujah and the only
[1:27:44] thing left in our story here now in the
[1:27:47] culmination of our of our life is for
[1:27:50] our bodies to be changed amen and I
[1:27:52] don't know how it's going to happen but
[1:27:54] I can promise you it's going to happen I
[1:27:56] don't know how it's going to be but I
[1:27:58] know it's going to be because God's word
[1:27:59] says it would be and that's the only
[1:28:01] thing that we have to look left on
[1:28:03] Hallelujah that's the only thing left in
[1:28:05] God's design is for us to take a body
[1:28:08] change for us to see some maybe a funny
[1:28:10] feeling P says and and then be changed
[1:28:12] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:28:15] amen he began preaching that and he said
[1:28:17] and maybe there was halfway Believers
[1:28:19] there oh saints of God don't find
[1:28:22] yourself in that category
[1:28:27] every person that ever heard the message
[1:28:29] of Noah even the ones that hated and
[1:28:32] despised his family and could never just
[1:28:34] never wrap their minds around you know
[1:28:37] the Holiness and and standards and but
[1:28:40] when that rain started
[1:28:42] falling whether they were in the Ark of
[1:28:45] Safety or not they believe the message
[1:28:49] then but it was too late saints of God
[1:28:52] some of them said well you know what
[1:28:53] it's Gotta I'm G to agree with sister
[1:28:55] suie down there brother ROM says this
[1:28:56] paragraph 184 the big church that old
[1:28:59] man is crazy he went up there and shut
[1:29:00] the door and said this rain was going to
[1:29:02] fall and sets he there and there's
[1:29:04] nothing to it see Sun come right up when
[1:29:06] across like that no such thing as rain
[1:29:08] so then lukewarm halfway Believers
[1:29:11] half-hearted that's not willing to take
[1:29:13] God Plum down to the end of the road
[1:29:16] live or die you see what I mean and then
[1:29:18] he says stand in your fortified
[1:29:21] condition live or die sink or drown
[1:29:24] Hallelujah stay right there just the
[1:29:27] same saints of God stand in your
[1:29:29] fortified condition stand in this evil
[1:29:32] day to stand when you've done all the
[1:29:34] Bible says when you've done all to stand
[1:29:37] then stand
[1:29:39] Hallelujah glory to God don't find
[1:29:42] yourself in that category a halfway
[1:29:45] believer halfhearted how sad that would
[1:29:48] be that you were given an opportunity to
[1:29:51] see the light of the message of your
[1:29:53] hour and you only believed it halfway
[1:29:56] you know people believed that they
[1:29:57] listened to Moses Noah's message maybe
[1:30:00] they came even so close to believe in it
[1:30:02] maybe one day they trickled into his
[1:30:04] church maybe they started hearing those
[1:30:06] words maybe they were convicted a little
[1:30:08] bit but they never went all the way with
[1:30:11] Jesus they never went all the way with
[1:30:13] the message and when that rain started
[1:30:15] falling oh when that rain started
[1:30:17] falling they were not in the Ark of
[1:30:19] Safety get in the Ark of Safety today if
[1:30:22] you don't have the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:24] Ghost you need it if you don't have an
[1:30:26] experience with God you need it
[1:30:29] hallelujah hallelujah you stay there
[1:30:31] until you get it you say I don't know if
[1:30:33] I got it stay there until you know cuz
[1:30:36] you're going to know you start having a
[1:30:38] fellowship that you don't understand you
[1:30:40] start having communion with the Creator
[1:30:43] Hallelujah you'll know
[1:30:45] hallelujah
[1:30:48] hallelujah hallelujah you've got to be
[1:30:51] just sold out to it Saints
[1:30:54] you
[1:30:56] know David's
[1:30:58] leadership there in 2 Samuel the 23rd
[1:31:01] chapter he said this was some of the
[1:31:04] last words the Bible says that were ever
[1:31:06] spoken by David scripture says this was
[1:31:09] some of the final days in David's life
[1:31:12] and just like Joshua's last sermon there
[1:31:15] to Israel that day David's men had
[1:31:18] watched the character through his reign
[1:31:21] as a king through the battles he fought
[1:31:24] through the way that he conducted
[1:31:25] himself and they had such a reverence
[1:31:28] for him and the Bible CS these men
[1:31:30] Mighty Men they were they were they were
[1:31:32] they so highly respected David you know
[1:31:35] that after a battle one day David began
[1:31:37] just uttering some words it was just a
[1:31:40] little desire in his heart but these men
[1:31:42] had so much respect for his word that
[1:31:46] even as he uttered and he whispered a
[1:31:48] simple desire these three men had had
[1:31:52] such high regard for him they risked
[1:31:54] their lives all he wanted for us was
[1:31:57] just a drink from The Well of the water
[1:32:00] of Bethlehem oh and so what did they do
[1:32:02] they fought their way to they put their
[1:32:05] lives on the line because of the of the
[1:32:08] utterance of a desire of their King oh
[1:32:11] saints of God I want you to notice today
[1:32:14] that that should be the believer's
[1:32:15] desire that even if there's an utterance
[1:32:18] of the word of our Majesty the king even
[1:32:21] if there's an area in your life that you
[1:32:23] may not feel like is a compromise if God
[1:32:26] wants you to give that thing up you give
[1:32:28] that thing up because that's your desire
[1:32:30] amen you want some more of God in your
[1:32:32] life you start giving up things you
[1:32:34] start just giving God your heart you
[1:32:36] start making him ruler and reer
[1:32:40] Hallelujah I want to be like those men
[1:32:42] that even at the utterance even at the
[1:32:44] desire spoken of my God even at the
[1:32:47] message even at the things that seem
[1:32:49] like it's so hard I want you God to
[1:32:52] rule Hallelujah
[1:32:55] Hallelujah that should be the that
[1:32:57] should be the heart of a Believer his
[1:33:00] desire outweighs every one of yours amen
[1:33:03] it should mean that much to us that we
[1:33:05] should risk Our Lives we could risk our
[1:33:07] reputation we should risk our
[1:33:09] relationship we should risk everything
[1:33:12] for him saints of God it's not just a a
[1:33:15] God trying to push you into doing
[1:33:17] something he wants you to make a Rapture
[1:33:19] he wants you to be in Kingdom with him
[1:33:22] he wants you to rule and reign with him
[1:33:24] but he can't do it if you're living in
[1:33:26] sin he can't do it if you're living in
[1:33:28] adultery he can't do it if you're living
[1:33:30] wrong you got to give yourself to God
[1:33:33] fully
[1:33:35] hallelujah hallelujah you got to risk
[1:33:37] your social status you got to risk
[1:33:39] everything you got to put it all on the
[1:33:42] line Hallelujah you put his word above
[1:33:46] your own word glory to
[1:33:49] God
[1:33:51] hallelujah you know now in back in the
[1:33:54] midst of the restoration of the temple
[1:33:56] there it says that he set in charge
[1:33:58] leaders and the Bible calls them Workman
[1:34:02] and they did the work Faithfully
[1:34:05] it's these men were in charge of
[1:34:08] individuals that the word calls bearers
[1:34:12] of burdens now one thing I believe he
[1:34:15] does it in my life I believe the enemy
[1:34:17] does in our life is he'll start to he'll
[1:34:20] start to say you don't matter he'll
[1:34:22] start to say you're nobody that you've
[1:34:24] never done a single thing for God oh
[1:34:27] saints of God it's a lie from the pits
[1:34:29] of Hell amen God saved you for the end
[1:34:32] time for a reason amen he saved you to
[1:34:34] be the last runner in the race for a
[1:34:36] reason and I believe it's because he
[1:34:38] knew amen that you would be faithful
[1:34:40] bearers of this burden amen faithful
[1:34:43] bearers of this precious word and I
[1:34:45] believe in my life and in my and in my
[1:34:48] heart that we are placed into people's
[1:34:50] lives friends and family children and
[1:34:53] parents for that reason because you bear
[1:34:55] the burden of seeing that individual
[1:34:57] come to Christ and no matter how little
[1:35:00] you feel God can do great exploits in
[1:35:02] your life through Warriors of player
[1:35:04] prayer if you yield yourself to him
[1:35:08] amen looking for he's looking for
[1:35:10] believers of his word the greatest
[1:35:12] talents they mean nothing to
[1:35:15] God he's looking for believers that
[1:35:17] won't just take part of his word and
[1:35:19] that won't shy away from him in the
[1:35:21] difficult
[1:35:22] times you know the prophet comes there
[1:35:25] in the sermon
[1:35:27] leadership
[1:35:29] 1965 one of the very last sermons Pastor
[1:35:32] was talking about on that brother
[1:35:34] Brenham ever preaches and I thought just
[1:35:36] how closely it tied in with the last
[1:35:38] message ever preached by Joshua that day
[1:35:41] standing there the one that led all of
[1:35:43] Israel into the promised land I want you
[1:35:46] to see the contrast this morning they
[1:35:48] had the same message the same word
[1:35:52] Joshua said you've got to make your
[1:35:54] choice Israel you choose this day whom
[1:35:57] you're going to serve friends the the
[1:36:00] world offers all kinds of inlets to the
[1:36:02] word of God but there is only one way to
[1:36:03] God and that's through Christ Jesus it's
[1:36:06] through the Passover Lamb it's through
[1:36:08] the shed blood it's through the word of
[1:36:10] your day it's through the message of the
[1:36:12] hour amen the the prophet began
[1:36:14] contrasting two different lives as we
[1:36:17] heard Pastor teach on Wednesday and he
[1:36:19] actually proved by scripture the
[1:36:21] evidence and the outcomes of those
[1:36:23] Lifestyles amen the rich man there in
[1:36:25] the gospels there was a sincere man amen
[1:36:28] he was a church grow goer and he had
[1:36:31] come to a Crossroads in his life that he
[1:36:33] knew that something was missing amen so
[1:36:36] he came to Jesus seeking that Missing
[1:36:38] Link and God gave him an answer he said
[1:36:41] sell out to the world sell out to the
[1:36:43] idols that hold you back and it never
[1:36:46] says I noticed this it never says that
[1:36:48] he quit going to church it never even
[1:36:50] says that he quit calling himself a
[1:36:52] Believer but what happened is that he
[1:36:54] left the word and the evidence of his
[1:36:56] life was proved by the scriptures that
[1:36:59] sincerity is not enough you cannot just
[1:37:02] be sincere you've got to go all the way
[1:37:05] with Jesus young people I want you to
[1:37:07] notice this morning that you that the
[1:37:10] Rich Young Ruler the story of the Rich
[1:37:12] Young Ruler does it is not some foreign
[1:37:14] concept you walk in his shoes this
[1:37:16] morning he had parents that obviously
[1:37:19] taught him the ways of God because he
[1:37:21] followed the statutes of God as a Young
[1:37:23] Man
[1:37:24] and he came to a Crossroads he maybe he
[1:37:25] went to church maybe he did all the
[1:37:27] right things but he never came to a true
[1:37:29] experience when the word manifested
[1:37:33] Jesus Christ came to him and showed him
[1:37:35] the way of Salvation he never was able
[1:37:38] to go all the way with him and I believe
[1:37:40] that some could stand here in those same
[1:37:42] shoes the Rich Young Ruler you're not so
[1:37:45] far off from his position amen he's that
[1:37:47] he he was a young man and he came to a
[1:37:49] Crossroads in his life amen and God said
[1:37:52] you have to do this this is all you're
[1:37:53] missing amen oh but he couldn't do
[1:37:57] it couldn't sell out to the
[1:38:00] world you could be doing the right thing
[1:38:02] living the way your parents taught you
[1:38:03] but there's another step that you've got
[1:38:06] to take you've got to take it that
[1:38:09] further than rules and statutes and
[1:38:11] biblical Concepts it's got to be real to
[1:38:14] you it's got to be a living reality
[1:38:16] saints of God you've got to come into
[1:38:19] complete obedience to his word and I I
[1:38:22] promise when you're there you'll you'll
[1:38:23] want to be nowhere else you'll want to
[1:38:26] be nowhere
[1:38:28] else glory to
[1:38:31] God he contrasts Moses and he says you
[1:38:34] see Moses a faithful servant who
[1:38:36] esteemed the reproach of Christ came to
[1:38:39] the same Crossroads in his life could
[1:38:41] have ruled Egypt but he chose the way of
[1:38:44] the
[1:38:45] word and he when he died the Angels
[1:38:47] picked him up a way to glory and we saw
[1:38:50] the evidence of it 800 years later at
[1:38:52] the Mount of Transfiguration amen when
[1:38:55] he stood there fellowshipping with the
[1:38:57] one who he allowed lead him amen he was
[1:39:00] fellowshipping there and we saw the
[1:39:02] fruition of what the Rich Young Ruler
[1:39:04] went through he was in Hell tormented by
[1:39:07] the regions Beyond amen glory to
[1:39:11] God just some closing comments let's all
[1:39:14] stand to our feet this
[1:39:15] morning brother Tony you come and just
[1:39:18] play something real soft just whatever
[1:39:20] your heart's choosing is
[1:39:23] brother brandom says this he says now
[1:39:25] you're ordained to life you see it if
[1:39:28] you ordained to see it if you're not
[1:39:30] ordained to see it you won't see it said
[1:39:33] they have eyes but they can't see ears
[1:39:36] and they can't hear how thankful you
[1:39:38] should be Church how you should
[1:39:40] straighten yourself up from these things
[1:39:42] how you should be on fire for God that
[1:39:45] your eyes behold what you see your ears
[1:39:47] hears the things that you hear the
[1:39:50] leadership why did you come at things
[1:39:51] that you see leadership why did you come
[1:39:53] here tonight to hear a message like this
[1:39:55] I'm branded across the world by the
[1:39:57] churches as a fanatic why did you come
[1:40:00] the Holy Spirit Led you here to
[1:40:05] listen cut away the things of the world
[1:40:09] and accept the leadership of Jesus
[1:40:11] Christ or you'll perish just as sure as
[1:40:14] the
[1:40:15] world he says he says what do you look
[1:40:17] like what are you following what have we
[1:40:19] done you must choose your leader choose
[1:40:22] today you got to choose life your choice
[1:40:24] will determine your Eternal destination
[1:40:26] what you choose remember Jesus said
[1:40:29] follow me and you're invited to do not
[1:40:31] tonight to do so to follow him to
[1:40:35] eternal life you must come on his
[1:40:39] terms amen that's right not upon the
[1:40:41] word not upon the Creed not upon public
[1:40:44] opinion not upon what the what anybody
[1:40:46] else thinks about it but upon what God
[1:40:49] said about it I believe this morning we
[1:40:51] prove by the word what God said about it
[1:40:53] amen I believe we hear every M every uh
[1:40:56] sermon preach what God says about his
[1:40:59] word especially lately how he how it's
[1:41:02] just showing that God God's heart is to
[1:41:04] show us that there can't be a compromise
[1:41:07] saints of God there can't be an area of
[1:41:09] your life where you don't want God to
[1:41:11] rule that part of your life oh it
[1:41:13] doesn't matter what it is remember Jesus
[1:41:16] said follow me get rid of what you got
[1:41:18] and follow me and the only way to have
[1:41:20] eternal life that's the only remedy he
[1:41:23] gave gave this man was the only remedy
[1:41:24] he gave the businessman it's the only
[1:41:27] remedy he gives anybody his choice he
[1:41:30] makes his decision it's perfect every
[1:41:31] time and we must follow him is the only
[1:41:34] way to have eternal life he says so the
[1:41:36] leadership of God is to follow the
[1:41:39] Vindicated word of the hour which is the
[1:41:41] holy go by the Holy Ghost amen don't be
[1:41:44] scared by fancy words the Vindicated
[1:41:46] word of the hour is the message preached
[1:41:48] that there's no compromise we don't
[1:41:51] compromise on the on anything the world
[1:41:53] says says amen we stand true to What God
[1:41:56] Says throughout all the ages
[1:41:59] amen my brother my sister he says to
[1:42:02] circumcise the things of the world cut
[1:42:04] away those things what is it that's
[1:42:06] leading your life amen and if you've
[1:42:09] never made the choice take the choice of
[1:42:11] the leadership of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:13] this morning today is the day of
[1:42:17] salvation and saints of God I believe
[1:42:19] many of you have already made that
[1:42:21] choice I believe there's there's men and
[1:42:22] women in here that have made the choice
[1:42:25] to serve God but maybe something said
[1:42:27] today pricked your heart amen and you
[1:42:30] want the fire of the word back in your
[1:42:31] life I believe God can revive that fire
[1:42:34] in your life I believe God can revive
[1:42:37] even in a simple service like that with
[1:42:39] a nobody preacher can revive the fire of
[1:42:41] God in your
[1:42:42] life Josiah set his eyes towards God he
[1:42:46] humbled himself at the hearing of the
[1:42:48] word and the reading of the law and God
[1:42:50] did The Impossible in his life he
[1:42:53] Sanctified the whole Kingdom he
[1:42:56] reestablished worship maybe something in
[1:42:58] your life needs some restoration this
[1:43:00] morning take a stand this morning stand
[1:43:03] for the word of God ex let the word
[1:43:07] examine the inward parts of your being
[1:43:09] the inward parts of your life amen don't
[1:43:12] fall prey to the modern theory of the
[1:43:14] devil's lies the modern culture saints
[1:43:17] of God we serve an unchanging God
[1:43:20] Hebrews 13 and8 says he is still the
[1:43:22] same today as he was then and he'll
[1:43:25] still be the same tomorrow as he was
[1:43:27] then so we follow the god of then and
[1:43:30] the god of now and the god of
[1:43:33] Tomorrow amen we the Lord just kept
[1:43:36] pressing me on that for this morning if
[1:43:37] there's Avenues of your life maybe
[1:43:39] there's a trend in your home even
[1:43:41] Believers Born Again of the spirit of
[1:43:43] God maybe there's something starting to
[1:43:45] take place some rote in your life some
[1:43:48] habit that you maybe you thought was
[1:43:49] harmless but it's grown into something
[1:43:51] that's taking you away from the Lord
[1:43:53] something that's getting maybe too close
[1:43:55] to the line of compromise give that
[1:43:57] thing over to God this morning the Bible
[1:43:59] says to shun the very appearance of evil
[1:44:02] and remember that everything is a seed
[1:44:04] amen even if it seems harmless now so
[1:44:06] did the words of the serpent to Eve it
[1:44:09] seemed harmless so did the sacrifice at
[1:44:12] Cain's altar but you watch it what it
[1:44:14] led to it led to Eternal separation from
[1:44:17] God you've already got the evidence
[1:44:20] taken a stand for the word like Moses
[1:44:22] did
[1:44:23] amen and the rich the rich
[1:44:26] man let's just close our eyes this
[1:44:31] morning Ephesians 5 says be washed By
[1:44:35] the Waters of Separation The Waters of
[1:44:38] the
[1:44:39] word oh heavenly father I want to
[1:44:43] declare the words that Joshua declared
