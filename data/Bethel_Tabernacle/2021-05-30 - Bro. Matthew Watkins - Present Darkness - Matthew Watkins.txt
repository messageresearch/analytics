========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] chapter 5 first peter chapter 5. if you have your bible apologize we're a little bit late it's my fault i messed up on the schedule there we had a brother out of town and i felt to reschedule that spot so we were just trying to get the stream the recording going amen but we'd like to begin a series and i tried everything in my mind to be able to condense this into one teaching then i just felt that that was uh the lord just having me not do that so we're gonna break this up into a few and i'd like to speak to you i'm just going to title this series present darkness present darkness and we'd like to cover um at least there will be at least one more to this so i'm probably going to leave you on a cliffhanger and some of the things we're going to talk about are going to be a little heavy uh here today spoke to the brothers on some of these lines yesterday at the men's breakfast but i don't want to rush and i don't want to conclude so i may say a lot i may pose a lot of questions that we don't necessarily give direct answers to now but lord willing uh we'll wrap back around to some of those things and and come to a conclusion in other words you're only going to get half of it today and we may end on a cliffhanger but that's all right first peter chapter 5 verse 8. i'd like you to turn to revelations 12 after that so let's read this first in first peter 5. be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour revelations chapter 12 i'll read one more scripture and i'll have you be seated revelations 12 12 brother joe when you have that and there appear to great uh that's yeah let's go to verse 12 that's verse 1 verse 12 yeah therefore rejoice you heavens and you that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth so heavens rejoicing but woe to those on the earth well that's a problem because i don't know if y'all looked around lately we're not in heaven or right here on the earth the bible says woe to the inhabitants inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth he hath but a short time you can be seated we read in first peter chapter five and there's many scriptures we could use to describe our adversary to describe our foe the devil the bible uses many different terms but some of those we'll just save for today and we'll just read just a couple of these but in fur in john chapter 8 jesus refers to the devil and says he was a murderer from the beginning a murderer think about that that's a you can call a you can a person could be attributed or an adjective could be described to you to to uh speak of someone in a horrible way but a murderer and jesus says he's a murderer from the beginning first peter paul says be sober be vigilant because here's your adversary i'm going to describe him for you because you don't you've never met him face to face as you would meet a man you don't see him every single day you don't have a conversation with him but yet he's he's real yet he's um he's as real as any person that you could meet you would say a natural enemy that you have someone that you despise or someone that despises you but paul says i'm going to describe him for you he's like a roaring lion now remember that jesus is also typed as jehovah is typed as the lion of the tribe of judah but paul is using a com a completely different analogy or an illustration to describe the devil the lion that jesus has referred to is in power and in strength and in defense and as a protector as a lion of the tribe of judah but paul is using the devil and he's going to describe him as like a roaring lion if you ever seen a lion on the prowl or on the hunt and he's and he's and he's tr he's looking for for something to consume or something to just rip into and shred the pieces and if you've ever watched any national geographics and watch some of the images of a lion there's nothing that is more ferocious uh uh just a ferocious animal that when he when he when he attacks and he and he gets hold he subdues whatever it is that he's attacking he just he he he annihilates that animal immediately it's just almost instant death and this is what paul is describing when he says be sober christians believers be vigilant be sober be on guard be ready because your enemy who's attacking you is like a roaring lion seeking on the prowl on the hunt finding vulnerabilities looking for weaknesses looking for moments of weakness when he can attack and when he attacks his purpose is to murder amen now that's going to be really important as we go through some of this his purpose is murder he doesn't want to just hurt you or offend you or hurt your feelings or make your life a little bad and a little uncomfortable he he wants to murder you he wants to destroy you he's looking to destroy and jesus calls him that and says he's a murderer he's been a murderer from the beginning revelations 12 what are the inhabitants of the earth for the devil this roaring lion so the scripture paints this uh this adversary is a maniac just a a it one and and it's not just a not just a roaring lion as he uses that adjective but or that descriptor but he's a he's he knows he has but a short time he knows his time is running out and he's been unleashed upon the earth and upon the sea the scripture says i thought of this the lord began to deal with my heart and i spoke to the brothers yesterday about this at the breakfast it's it's incredible because i was i was watching a viewing documentary on the columbine high school shootings when two boys walked into a high school that they had attended and they felt the need to they they felt they were picked on and bullied and they were the outcasts and so they premeditated and concocted a plan to go into a school and take weapons and and just go on a rampage and murder and i i after watching that you know it's a it's incredible it's almost becomes a little surreal because we've been so inundated since that point with school shooting after school shooting and and just horrible things i was just it sort of spawned all this yesterday or the the i think it was friday and thursday or friday in the news maybe some of you read it about the man uh there who went into i think he worked at a railroad uh or a train station there and he went into his work and he and he there was a mass shooting there where he had he murdered several individuals wounded several others and it was incredible watching the door cam footage of the man from the neighbor who she had watched uh that not that she had watched but that camera had viewed for years of the same man going through the same routine walking out of his house in his work clothes his work garb he has an old ford truck he's walking in front of it he put loads of stuff in usually his coffee or whatever he has he gets in the driver's seat he starts the car always at the same time every day same routine going to work except this day the security camera footage shows him come out with a duffel bag and he very nonchalantly not in any kind of a rush opens the door like he always does loads of stuff grabs the duffel bag puts it in goes to the driver's side about the same exact time closes the door starts his truck except for in that duffel bag is multiple high-powered weapons and rifles and and pistols and and every kind of array of of weaponry to cause destruction and ruin and murder and it's almost surreal watching and i asked just watching these images how could a person how could a could a human being who is uh who who's in this who who operates in the same um world that i operate in go has the same emotions obviously had a father had a mother don't know his backstory don't know what happened there but how could a human being go into this railroad facility and just start shooting people and hearing some of the horror and stories of the survivors of one man who uh garnered a gathered a bunch of people into a room told them they went into shock and end up went into panic and he yells at them and tells them get out of here there's a shooter you got to get into this locked door and get behind it and he finally got him got all i think it was 10 or 11 of them put in there and before he could make it in the shooter was there and they watched him execute him right there in front of him saved all their life lost his watching the going through some of the women what would be memory for all of us here i think all of us maybe not not every individual but most of us here today would remember the columbine high school shootings and the the immediate when you mentioned that name columbine even that city uh that entire community has was destroyed their their reputation forever what that city is even known for and that is is those school shootings what was incredible as was is hearing the back story of those two boys that there was really didn't make rhyme or reason didn't make any sense didn't come to family you'd think they'd come from some home where you know they were there was some form of abuse or something and but really just a normal american family you know um uh you know just normal home raised and you think how could a how could a how could a person how could a human get to such a point to where these two boys would go and premeditate this entire thing and and plan the entire thing out and then go into the school and and then just one by one watching the cameras there was no it wasn't erratic behavior it wasn't it wasn't panicked it was controlled premeditated and cold and evil evil we look for the the rhyme or reason people uh has has tried to you know to diagnose and say how could a per what must have been the video games it must have been this there must have been some abuse or psychologically there's got to be something there wrong you know with and they what they what they they miss that in plain sight that what the answer is and all of those things that they name and we've got to go to congress get with our congressmen we got to change the laws we gotta and and all of these are a way because the human mind has to intellectually answer the question as not just to the how it happened but why why did it happen and we've got to have solutions we've got to prevent it we've got to be aware and and prevent this the next time and it's really just going for the symptoms and not the calls and the cause is evil the cause is present darkness that the world is surrounded in and engulfed in and that darkness the bible says is getting greater and to the point to where it calls it a gross darkness and it's not gross like the word yuck or disgusting but it's it's a form it's a metric of measurement that it's a thick exactly it's a thick gross heavy darkness what was probably the most sobering and we may not get too much more that's all right what was so sobering about watching that was the worst part was not necessarily to watch these boys and you watch the premeditation of you know these boys that would go into a girl and here she is praying on her knees and calling out to god and then he puts a gun to her head and pulls the trigger it's a horrible thing you think how how could a person the bible says that they would be without natural affection and it's almost a loss of how do you not have the natural affection of another a human being to another human being to where you can get so cold to where they had given way they had given over they had just like legion had started somewhere brother random calls him you know a man there with a family a husband and children an alcohol or something or a temper that he couldn't control and then one demon turns into two and turns into ten and one hundred and to where he has two thousand and he's a social outcast living in a cemetery and and just like that he had he had given a place to the devil and the devil had possessed his body brother travis used the example of judas yesterday that the bible says that and and satan now having entered the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to portray him so there was a moment when the devil entered him and now he's completely possessed by that spirit that he's worshiped or given place to but there was months there was years probably a track record of compromise or giving in to the devil it's amazing because as i said one of the most horrible things to try to reconcile or to to process was not necessarily the damage of the loss of those individuals those that numeric number uh at columbine of those who died and those who were injured but what was so shocking and what you what was uh i guess so sobering for me when i watched the documentary was not necessarily the worst part was not the loss of life there on that one day in one hour and six minutes whatever it was of of chaos but it was the trail of carnage of broken homes and broken families and suicides the amount of suicides of people and families who were connected to some of those children and some of the school staff that years later even as recent i think it was 2018 of of of a suicide from that just living with years of that grief and trauma and that ptsd of that moment you know who you blame you blame dylan or the the you blame the individual boys do you blame the parents do you blame the schools you blame the guns you know what you do you just keep blaming and blaming and blaming and if you keep tracing it back and tracing it back and tracing it back and tracing it back you eventually land in the garden of eden and you blame you put the blame where it really belongs and that's to the devil the serpent because jesus says he was a murderer from the beginning he was a murderer from the beginning he's evil and evil possesses the hearts and minds of people the ravaged homes and the lives the pain of the family the heartbreak of of the of the brothers one man who goes around the country now because of how brutal he was and how how bullying she was to his sister i think he was i think he was 15 and she was 12 or whatever age it was and she was the first one she was the first one shot at columbine on the stairs before the boys entered the school they shot her and he had spent a life of just despising her and picking on her and and impugning her her character whenever he could get in front of someone he just he would tell how nasty he was and now that boy has dealt with years he dealt with for almost a year of suicide tried several times to kill himself because he couldn't handle the grief of how he treated some his sister who's now gone and now he's lost her and and and now he goes around to school after school even today on and and speaks up to children about bullying and brothers and siblings and how you should treat and appreciate each other it's been it's been years of just collateral damage from that one moment that one hour and now there's there's lives and ruin and destruction and you know this is this is the devil's desire this is what he's after he's a raging maniac and and he's he wants to destroy and in any way he can destroy or afflict you or attack you in any possible way that he can he's there to destroy he's there the bible says woe unto the inhabitants of the earth for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knows that he has but a short time brother branham's we spoke yesterday on this the prophet of god speaks to us about the seven dimension environment that man is constantly contacting and and from the from the in from the moment of the fall when time begins when when when there's a curse brought on humanity and that curse that's that is the serpent is going to be cursed but it's not just the serpent who's cursed but also the woman in in humanity adam and eve are cursed and the ground is cursed and the earth is cursed and everything in the world is cursed now the now the the the the woman and the man will work by the sweat of his brow you remember the scripture when they're in the garden when when the god is speaking and says now and labor and sweat and toil and it won't yield a it'll yield thistles and thorns unto you but further than that it wasn't just the earth but man was also brought under a sin curse and he's lives he lives under that sin curse the world is cursed we we we we can speak of many types of of evil in the world and we probably shouldn't do that it's probably gonna be a hard spot to segue so let's stand we're out of time i told you i'd leave you on a cliffhanger lord we hear these some of these sobering thoughts that we brought to our mind lord but it's the reality of this present darkness this world that we have to live in lord but you placed us here for a purpose for a reason we spoke last sunday on salt and light and you said you are the salt of the earth you are the light and man doesn't take a light and light a candle and hide it under a bushel but he sets it like a city upon a hill lord in this present world we're so grateful that we have a lighthouse that we have a refuge that we can turn to we have a place lord that we can live where there's protection from the wrath and the evil that the devil the apostle paul says therefore wherefore put on the whole armor of god because your battle is real your enemy is real so put on the whole armor because your adversary our battle is not against flesh and blood but it's against spiritual wickedness evil in high places so lord help us every day to put on the whole armor of god to be sober to be vigilant as the book of peter says because our adversary is a roaring lion seeking whom whom he may devour help us lord every day to put on that whole armor whereby we may be able to withstand the fiery darts of the enemy granted lord jesus i pray for this service for the singing the worship lord the minister and of your word i pray that you'd bless it now in jesus name amen you
