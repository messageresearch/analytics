TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e e e for e e e for for e morning everyone uh let's let's stand going to continue on our topic Israel God's time piece this will be part seven we'll pray heavenly father thank you so much for this time of fellowship and your word together Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit would be be in our midst Lord and take your word and write it on our hearts be with us and guide and direct our thoughts we we need we need you we need your anointing we need your wisdom Lord we ask in Jesus name amen go ahead and bring up the PowerPoint we'll start at uh Zechariah Chapter 13 and we'll read a couple verses in that day there shall be a fountain open to the House of David into the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness and it shall come to pass in that day sayith the Lord of hosts that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no more be remembered and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean Spirit to pass out of the land may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so looking at this verse of course we understand it's speaking of the end time um if we saw previously in um Zechariah 12 it a few back he said he'll pour out on the House of David and upon the habitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of Supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mour for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn so as we looked before we understand that he's going to open a fountain for them it's a Fountain of Grace it's a restoration to the New Covenant you know we looked at also uh and we'll we'll read it again but we looked at uh chapter 14 of the Book of Revelation and we refer to this they will look upon him I believe and it shall come let's keep reading it and when it it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him Thou shalt not live for thou speakest lies in the name of the Lord and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesies and it shall come to pass in that day that the prophet shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he has prophesied neither shall he wear a rough garment to deceive but he shall say I no Prophet I am husbandman for a man taught to keep cattle from my Youth and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thy hands then he shall answer those those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends amen awake oh sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow sayith the Lord of hosts Smite the shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones and it shall come to pass that in all the land sayeth the Lord two parts therein shall be cut off and die and the third part shall be left therein and I will bring the third part through the fire and I will refine them as silver is refined and will try them as gold is tried they shall call on my name and I will hear them I will say it is my people and they shall say the Lord is my God Amen so as we look and as we study this you can become confused because you just saw in one verse there's 2,000 years of History you have the the past being spoken of and the future being spoken of at the same time you have almost looks like as you're look reading the context he says the prophets will be ashamed and then suddenly it says I'm no Prophet I'm H am a husband and I taught to keep cattle from my youth one shall say what are the wounds in your hands so it's jumping from false prophets to the true prophet back and forth so you can see in and and again thousands of years in the in the past and scripture does this very often we we understand that brother Bram taught us that clearly from the word that in one prophecy you can have 2,000 years of History Malachi 4: 6 2,000 years of History Isaiah 61 2,000 years of History just in a comma or in that case I think it's a semicolon but we won't strain in a that and swallow a camel but you see just in that one verse there's a lot of history and it's jumping back and forth and there can be a confusion I think if you want to really look at the picture of what's happening it is going back and forth and it's speaking of the the attitude of the people towards the prophets and the false doctrine that the Jewish Nation is full of now that that's one that's people have a hard time swallowing and understanding much of Judaism that we have today is simply false Doctrine false teaching a false interpretation much of it in reality is a response against Christ against Christianity instead of looking at where they're at in Prophecy uh and repenting they dig down and to their own shame Mock and belittle Christ and so this is the attitude towards the prophets in fact this will be the attitude towards the two witnesses in Revelation 11 it tells us there there'll be two witnesses Moses and Elijah and these two men will go forward and they will actually be rejected by the majority of Israel amen and so when when you see these prophecies that speaking of they will look upon Him whom they pierced on the top of Mount Zion we'll go there and I looked and lo a lamb stood on Mount Zion and with him 144,000 having his father's name written in their foreheads there it looks like okay Jesus comes down at the to meet us in the air goes up to the wedding supper then he comes down is on Mount Zion then he goes back up then he comes down in Revelation 19 it's a misunderstanding how is the Lamb standing on Mount Zion before he actually returns with his bride how is that how how does the spiritual revelation of who Jesus is Jesus of Nazareth is come to the nation of Israel does it come by Jesus coming and saying oh look at my hands look at my feet they look upon whom they pierced by a spirit of Revelation how is the son of man revealed to us in this day in physical form brother bradam says any man could come and say I got nail Pierce in my hands but no man can do what the spirit does through the body of Christ right and that's the same thing these the lamb is standing with the 144,000 by Spirit of Revelation that has been broken forth upon them it is finally open to their hearts who the lamb actually was and what his purpose to them they're blinded read read Isaiah 53 to a Jewish person and they say that's speaking about the nation of Israel that's not speaking about the Messiah see they've reinterpreted everything so that their eyes could stay blind but it'll come a time when there'll be two prophets come on the scene amen and the lamb will be revealed to them and it'll be that when that Revelation comes it'll be just as good as it'll actually be better than him standing there saying look at my hands look at my feet because even Thomas blessed are those who have not seen and do believe amen right it even to those who saw it had to be a spiritual revelation of who that was because it was a stone of stumbling to Israel Messiah is supposed to come and Conquer Rome conquer the Nations right that's their that's their understanding even the apostles when Christ came they couldn't catch the Revelation they only got it in part until the baptism of the Holy Ghost came on the day of Pentecost even then just before that they said will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel they didn't understand they didn't get it the Jewish mind became so corrupted by their interpretation of Prophecy that they couldn't see what was coming to pass right in front of them and that's the same thing that's happened to the Gentile Church prophecy coming to pass being fulfilled they can't see it right in front of them and the same thing will happen to much of Israel right but all Israel will be saved all the elect all the elected Remnant that's the predestinated seed of Israel will be saved all right let's keep let's keep going and again that's the 144,000 and how are the 144,000 sealed by receiving the revelation of the word through the two witnesses that's how they're sealed that's how they see receive a revelation of the father's name is by the preaching of the two witnesses amen Ezekiel 22 therefore thus saith the Lord God because you all are all become D behold therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem as they GA gather silver and brass and iron and lead and Tin into the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt it so will I gather you in mine anger and in my Fury and I will leave you there and melt you H isn't that interesting he's going to gather Israel together in his Fury so he doesn't gather them together in Grace think about that how did Israel get back to the land ultimately it is Grace we understand that but it's in his Fury he gathers them to together because they were blinded they rejected Christ they turned from him him and here we are we see the pograms in the Soviet Union and the Nazis Gathering them together we talked about the Fishers this is God pouring out his wrath upon the nation of Israel and in the same turn bringing forth his grace to bring him back to the land but ultimately they don't receive their Grace until they're back in the land amen so in his anger he gathers them back to Israel to Jerusalem yes I will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath and you shall be melted in the midst thereof as silver is melted in the midst of the Furnace so shall you be melted in the midst thereof and you shall know that I the Lord have poured out my Fury upon you even remember when are they when are the 144,000 saved they're not saved in the grace age they're saved in the time s once the bride is taken out of the away then God's Wrath begins to be poured out upon the Earth we're the ones preventing the wrath of God Amen being poured out upon the Earth but once we're taken out of the way that that will Antichrist will be be fully manifested Satan incarnate in flesh and the wrath of God will be poured out and he's using those two witnesses it's part of their Ministry to Smite the Earth with curses and plagues like the Bible said and in the midst of that I believe that's part of their Vindication just as part of Moses Vindication in Egypt was smiting that land with plagues so will part of Moses and Elijah's Vindication of their ministry will be smiting the Earth with plagues amen preventing rain etc etc and so their ministry will do that and in so doing it to the true elected it will vindicate the word heard that they're preaching they'll be preaching to them the New Covenant the things that we have been restored unto it will be to them the new the true New Covenant the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seal of God but it's in the midst of the Furnace that he's doing this it's in the midst of the Dragon spurting his water against the woman amen we should we should have included that scripture revelation 12 the woman Israel and so we'll keep continue on behold the day of the Lord cometh now this is speaking of the tribulation period when the day of the Lord when he pours out his wrath upon the Earth then then comes the Millennium so the day of the Lord comes and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of Thee for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle right so you have to see if you realize you're living in the end time you have to see the tide of the Nations will be going against Israel and to the point where they're all ready to gather in war and fight against them which we see that process taking place even in America now even from conservative ranks an anti-israel Viewpoint is starting to raise up and the city shall be taken notice and the house is rifled and the women ravished and half of the sh City shall go forth into captivity and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city so you see there'll be such a war towards the end of the Great Tribulation period that it will that the attack will come against Jerusalem M and there will be people brought out of the city sent out of the city right amen and there will be a great a a oh man a great persecution taking place then shall the Lord go forth and fight against those Nations as when he fought in the day of battle so you see it's in the midst of a furnace of fire a furnace of Affliction that the spirit of Grace is being being poured out and supplications is being poured out upon Israel then at the culmination of all of this that's when the Lord Goes Forth and he fights against those Nations as when he fought in the day of battle here and his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives which is before Jerusalem on the East and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the East and toward the west and there shall be a very great valley and half of the mountains shall remove toward the North and half of it toward the South and ye shall flee to the Valley of the mountains for the Valley of the mountains shall reach unto us all yay ye shall flee like as he fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and the Lord my God shall come and all the saints with thee see there's this is revelation 19 the coming of the Lord with his Saints shall come down to fight against the Nations and shall end up there in on Mount olives just outside the city Gates of Jerusalem and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark now you see how prophecy works you know this verse but it shall be in one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light we know brother brandham uses this scripture over and over and over again and sang the song ultimately this scripture is speaking about the end of the Great Tribulation period but we see again for the Gentile bride there's also an end time where there's an evening light message that goes forth so there's an evening light message that goes forth for the Gentiles and there's an evening light message that goes forth for the Jews what is that evening light message what does it culminate in Christ and his bride returning back to defeat the Antichrist in his armies and it shall be in that day that Living Waters shall go out from Jerusalem you see this process now we're turning God has poured out the spirit of Grace and supplications upon the nation of Israel so that the remnant 100 44,000 are be are saved then the Lord returns back to Earth again and it says that is when Living Waters will come out from Jerusalem again this is speaking of the Millennium half of them towards the former sea half of them toward the hinder sea in summer and in Winter it shall be and the Lord shall be king over all the Earth so that's what he's coming back to do and in that day shall there be one Lord and his name one and all the land shall be turned as a plain from giba to remon south of Jerusalem and it shall be lifted up and inhabited in her place from Benjamin's gate under the place of the first gate under the corner gate and from the Tower of hanal Unto the King's Wine Press and Men shall dwell in it there shall be no more utter destruction but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited amen amen when you preach this in an Arabic speaking world everybody goes quiet what's he preaching about we don't like to hear about Jerusalem's Victory and joy and this is going to be the capital city it's so strange but people have been so against that there's so such hatred for Israel that they miss the prophetic scriptures in literally in Jerusalem this is not a figure of speech this is not in heaven literally in Jerusalem we will come if you've never taken a trip to Jerusalem yet one day you will and you you won't need a jet to do it you'll have your own horse and you'll come down from heaven and you'll enter into the gates am with the Lord Jesus Christ right men shall dwell in it that's where peace will be it will C cover the Earth the knowledge of the Lord will cover the Earth Earth as the waters do the sea and it will come from where Mount Zion Jerusalem and this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will Smite now that now he goes backwards right he talks about what the goal is and what's going to happen then he goes backwards this is how the war will be won this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will Smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet and their eyes shall consume away and their whole and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth and it shall come to pass in that day that a great tumult from the Lord shall be among them and they shall lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbor and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor and Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem and the wealth of the Heathen round about shall be gathered together gold and S silver and a pear in great abundance and remember let me read this verse and so shall the plague be of the horse of the mule of the camel of the ass and of all the beasts that shall be in the tents as this plague all right so let me stop there for just a moment so remember that how does how does messiah defeat the Antichrist do you remember he he defeats him with what what's coming out of his mouth when he's on a on the sword what is a sword the word how does he defeat the Antichrist Isaiah 11 shows us that he defeats him with the breath of his lips so this is this this war that's taking place between these armies that gather against Israel is actually going to be won by the spoken word amen but I'll say this I don't believe it's just the anti the or the Messiah the Lord Jesus that speaks the word we will be fighting in the battle how will we fight the same thing by the spoken word and it will it will waste them away to nothing think about that for a minute so that's the plague that they that we Christ and his Saints will Smite the nations with amen and it shall come to pass that everyone now it's now it's fast forward again to the Millennium and it shall come to pass that everyone that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king the Lord of hosts and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles so there you have it it it this is this is the end result is that all the nations will be required to to Worship the Lord the word of the Lord will come forth who rules over the Nations Christ who else remember that we're we are to we are one of the rewards of the Bride is to rule over the nations with a rod of iron and so what are we being prepared for today think about that for a minute what is God's purpose for what you're going through today if you unless you suffer with him you cannot reign with him the the trials the tribulations the experience the faith that's growing the rapturing faith that's growing into us that's not just for the purpose of the Rapture there's purpose beyond that we're not just going to float on a cloud and play a harp we're going to a millennium amen where we do what rule over the nations with a rod of iron what does Jesus say in one of his rewards you've been faithful with this it'll be committed to you 10 cities 100 cities one city this is your reward think about that amen or Kings and Priests Kings of something it's not just a metaphor it's it's something that we're literally entering into that we're being prepared for that we're going to amen and it shall be that who so will not come up of all the families of the earth un Jerusalem to worship the king the Lord of hosts even upon them shall be no rain and if the family of Egypt go not up and come not that have no rain there shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will Smite the Heathen that come not up to keep the feasts of Tabernacles this shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that come not up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles in that day shall there be Bells upon shall there be upon the bells of the horses holiness under the Lord and the pots in the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar yay um yeah yay every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be Holiness unto the Lord and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them and Seed therein and in that day there shall be no more Canaanite in the house of the Lord amen so you look at that and you're looking at the Millennium lots of questions arise what does it mean about a sacrifice and so on and so forth that's not our P purview to get into all those details here in you know five minutes but as as we look at this we see the purpose of God for Israel is ultimately a millennium amen right all Israel will be saved that doesn't mean every single person that's a citizen of the nation the only real Israel is the predestinated sea seed of Israel we emphasize this last the last few sessions that we've done this when Jesus was speaking he was speaking to to all Jews right he spoke to Pharisees Sadducees all of them and the common people and it wasn't it wasn't the people that he was speaking to that he called they were of their father the devil that was the religious leaders that for jealousy couldn't receive him the most religious people in the nation of Israel are not the ones that are going to receive it's the it's the same thing it's the common man it's the common people that will hear the message the same people will reject the same high religious black suit guys they already have their interpretation of this Rabbi from Brooklyn he's there Messiah if you go around every almost every business on the back of all the signs it has pictures of the Reb that's what they call him he's just the Reb which means the rabbi and those people that are wearing the black suits and the black hat 95% of them believe that he's the Messiah and this is how he will return cuz he's dead by the way this is how he will come back from the dead and rule over Israel is they will get good and enough in God's sight they will achieve enough Holiness then the Reb will come back and will set up a kingdom over the Nations see they've already rejected the prophetic scriptures just like the Gentiles they're watching and looking for a Rapture to take place worldwide of every person that confesses Christ and little clothes are going to be laying on the side of the street they're looking for this fantastic nothing happens nothing happens nothing happens suddenly there's a Rapture out of nowhere that's their idea of what it's going to be and totally missing yes amen that there's there has to be a seventh star there has there there has to be a fulfillment you you try to tell them about seven Church ages they say that's that's one interpretation of it we don't look at it that way that's just the condition of every church if you look and see every Church every church will be like one of those seven churches and so it's an admonishment to all of all of us and they come up with their own understanding no no Malachi 4 that's just only for the Jews couldn't possibly be a gentile Prophet couldn't possibly be Revelation 10 that's for uh Israel that has nothing to do with the Gentiles see they've made they've pre pre- rejected the Christ they they pre- rejected the manifestation of the spirit in their midst see they don't they don't want it they' refused it they come up so far and then that's that's as far as they want to go and the same exact principle will happen in Israel they come up so far well these two prophets they're not they're not they're not hidic this so they possibly couldn't possibly be they're not Ultra Orthodox they couldn't possibly be they're preaching about Jes Jesus as the Messiah Jesus as a blasphemer in their minds they've pre- rejected the word and so what is it there's going to be a Remnant the predestinated seed a minority that will receive it actually it'll be a lot more people than received it the first time right it'll be for it'll be glorious compared to the first time the first time 120 went to the upper room right out of all Israel that's I don't even know if it's one tenth of 1% of Israel that went to the upper room of course many were saved after that but still several thousand and it's going to be 144,000 Amen in the tribulation period so it's quite quite astounding the Revival that will take place there and yet it still will be a vast minority of Jewish people that will receive it the majority will reject it the majority have already taken sides with the anti Antichrist right
