[42:20] dawson so glad he's here amen we're uh
[42:24] certainly love him very much and proud
[42:26] of him glad he came for gideon's

[42:31] here from tucson a little bit more humid
[42:33] here dawson but uh we got good weather i
[42:35] promise you just came at the wrong time
[42:37] [Laughter]
[42:40] i'd like to just make an announcement
[42:42] about the concessions that we talked
[42:44] about on wednesday
[42:46] the youth conceptions concessions are
[42:48] open starting today
[42:50] we ask that the children 10 and under be
[42:52] accompanied by an adult when purchasing
[42:55] items this is sort of one of the perils
[42:57] of what we're doing and we experienced
[42:59] this deer in co-op when back in the
[43:01] years and the days when we used to do
[43:03] concessions just make sure your children
[43:06] are
[43:06] any 10 and under accompanied by an adult
[43:09] when purchasing
[43:10] items so that no money goes missing
[43:14] or no no snacks go missing unpaid for
[43:18] the first refrigerator
[43:20] next to the counter uh where the
[43:22] concessions are so if you come in this
[43:24] door here to the first refrigerator on
[43:25] their left right to the right of the
[43:27] concessions the first refrigerator next
[43:29] to the counter where the concessions are
[43:32] has been set aside for drinks coffee etc
[43:36] that the youth are selling the middle
[43:38] fridge has now been converted to a
[43:39] freezer where the ice cream and
[43:41] popsicles that they are selling are the
[43:43] refrigerator closest to the bookshelf is
[43:46] for multi-purpose use for the church and
[43:48] congregation so the first two
[43:50] refrigerators are just for concessions
[43:52] so if you go in there and you grab
[43:54] something make sure you pay for what you
[43:56] take
[43:57] um
[43:58] or we'll we'll stick brother luther on
[44:00] you and i promise you don't want that
[44:04] the refrigerator closest to the
[44:06] bookshelf is for bookshelf is for
[44:07] multi-purpose
[44:09] as we mentioned on wednesday payment is
[44:11] on the honor system and there will be
[44:13] there will not be someone there watching
[44:14] at all times
[44:16] please discuss this with your younger
[44:18] children and make sure they know that
[44:19] everything on the counter and in the
[44:21] fridge and freezer is for sale
[44:23] not for free
[44:26] as mentioned on wednesday night this is
[44:28] a way for us to raise money for the
[44:29] youth fund 100 of every profit will go
[44:33] directly to that fund i mean i can just
[44:35] tell you that's a a fund that us
[44:38] we've we've already we're already a
[44:40] couple thousand dollars in the negative
[44:42] from just um

[44:45] drained everything that we had and we're
[44:47] about a little over two thousand dollars
[44:50] short of what we had but i'm grateful
[44:53] for the word that was sewn into our kids
[44:56] hearts
[44:57] uh over the weekend last weekend and
[44:59] it's certainly value you couldn't put a
[45:01] price on it couldn't put a price tag on
[45:04] that
[45:05] but we would just like to say it's we
[45:07] have more things that we'd like to do
[45:09] we're wanting to take them to the
[45:11] believer's youth camp there in uh
[45:13] indiana and so that's a great expense
[45:15] we're trying to fund and so if the lord
[45:17] put something on your heart i know god
[45:20] will bless you for also we'll be having
[45:22] a
[45:24] church-wide memorial day dinner
[45:27] next sunday there will be an
[45:29] announcement sent out on the whatsapp
[45:30] later today discussing the details so
[45:33] watch for that it'll be a memorial day
[45:35] dinner next sunday we love the lord
[45:38] we want to remember
[45:40] our pastor who's my dad who's away
[45:42] ministering for brother dale uh in
[45:44] flagstaff and all those maybe that
[45:46] aren't present here today traveling some
[45:48] i know and vacation but we just we're
[45:51] glad that we're here amen glad that the
[45:53] lord jesus is here i've never had the
[45:55] devil fight me
[45:56] more to preach a sermon than what i'm
[45:58] going to preach today
[45:59] and so i just knew at the moment there
[46:02] even in the back i just stopped what i
[46:04] was doing and this god
[46:05] talked to the lord and said lord i know
[46:07] that you're in complete control
[46:09] and so we're going to get a little take
[46:11] a step i don't know how far we'll get
[46:14] but we just got a lot on our plate we'd
[46:15] like to get to let's begin reading here
[46:17] in matthew chapter 16
[46:20] i'd like to minister and title this the
[46:22] order
[46:23] the order of the anointing and you'll
[46:26] see why here in a moment the order
[46:28] of the anointing
[46:30] the pharisees verse 1
[46:33] the pharisees also with the sadducees
[46:35] came and tempting desired him that he
[46:37] would show them a sign
[46:40] from heaven isn't it amazing how people
[46:42] always need
[46:44] a physical proof
[46:46] in order to accept something
[46:49] well
[46:50] that's how we are
[46:52] whether we like to admit it or not
[46:55] he answered and said unto them
[46:57] when it is evening you say it will be
[47:00] fair weather for the sky is red and in
[47:01] the morning it will be foul weather
[47:03] today for the sky does right skies right
[47:05] and lower and all you hypocrites
[47:07] you can discern the face of the sky but
[47:10] can you not discern the signs of the
[47:13] times
[47:14] now notice this is prophetic what jesus
[47:16] is going to speak here in verse 4 wasn't
[47:19] just speaking to the generation that he
[47:21] was there with but it would be a
[47:24] prophecy because this is speaking of the
[47:26] evening time that's what jesus said in
[47:29] the evening time and you see the sun is
[47:31] lowering so this is a prophecy that
[47:33] would come to pass in its perfection or
[47:36] for perfect fulfillment in the day and
[47:38] age you and i live in
[47:40] verse four
[47:42] a wicked and adulterous generation
[47:45] seeketh after a sign so one of the signs
[47:49] of the end time wicked and adulterous
[47:51] generation is that they would be sign
[47:53] seekers
[47:55] they would look for some proof or
[47:57] something
[47:58] and there shall no sign be given unto it
[48:02] but the sign of the prophet jonas
[48:05] and he left them and departed what's
[48:08] amazing is that what they didn't realize
[48:11] is that the sign was standing in front
[48:14] of them amen
[48:17] and they missed it
[48:18] entirely matthew chapter uh
[48:22] 26 let's just turn there quickly
[48:25] matthew chapter 26.
[48:37] let's just read it verse 30.
[48:39] and when they had sung in him
[48:41] they went out into the mount of olives
[48:43] then said jesus unto them
[48:45] and you shall be offended because of me
[48:48] this night for it is written i will
[48:50] smite the shepherd and the sheep of the
[48:52] flock shall be scattered abroad
[48:55] but after i am risen again i will go
[48:57] before you into galilee
[48:59] peter answered and said unto him
[49:02] though all men
[49:04] shall be offended because of thee yet
[49:06] will i never
[49:09] be offended
[49:11] jesus said unto them unto him verily i
[49:13] say unto thee that this night before the
[49:16] crow thou shalt deny me thrice
[49:20] peter said unto him though i should die
[49:22] with thee yet will i not deny thee
[49:26] likewise also said all of the disciples
[49:29] lord we're so grateful
[49:31] that you're here
[49:33] so grateful lord that you've called us
[49:35] lord i'm so now just aware
[49:38] of my own incapability lord
[49:41] insufficiency lord i stand here in great
[49:43] need as all of these that are here
[49:45] praying bow on their heads stand i'm
[49:47] just right with them lord
[49:49] in great need of you to come and speak
[49:52] lord i don't come today with wisdom lord
[49:54] that surpasses or would be great or give
[49:57] some great understanding lord but i just
[50:00] come in humility before you asking you
[50:03] god that you would come as the divine
[50:05] revealer of your word and may you speak
[50:07] to your children lord all those that
[50:09] have came with a need and an expectation
[50:12] i pray lord you'd meet them at the faith
[50:14] that they have this morning may you
[50:16] bless us lord bless our pastor away
[50:18] ministering in flagstaff lord just in a
[50:21] little while pray god you would anoint
[50:23] him anoint your servants all around the
[50:24] world we ask it in jesus christ's name
[50:27] and the church said
[50:29] amen amen you can be seated
[50:37] amen brothers if you have that power
[50:38] point you can just
[50:40] have that displayed and ready just for
[50:42] me if you could
[50:48] it's amazing what you find here when
[50:50] peter speaks these words and you're
[50:53] going to see this in luke chapter 22 if
[50:56] you turn in your bible we'll just read
[50:57] just a portion of scripture from there
[51:00] and i want you to notice what jesus says
[51:02] here and speaking and speaking to his
[51:05] disciples here in matthew luke chapter
[51:07] 22
[51:09] let's just begin reading at verse 48 but
[51:12] jesus said unto him judas betrayest thou
[51:14] the son of man with the kiss
[51:16] when they which were about him saw what
[51:18] would follow they said unto him lord
[51:21] shall we smite thee shall we smite with
[51:23] the sword and one of them smote the
[51:25] servant of the high priest and cut off
[51:27] his right ear and jesus answered and
[51:29] said suffer you thus far and he touched
[51:32] his ear and healed him then jesus said
[51:34] unto the chief priests and captains of
[51:36] the temples and the elders
[51:38] which were come to him but you come out
[51:41] as against a thief with swords and
[51:43] staves when i was daily with you in the
[51:45] temple you stretch forth no hands
[51:47] against me but this hour and the power
[51:50] of darkness then they took him and led
[51:52] him and brought him into the high priest
[51:54] house and peter followed afar off
[51:57] and when they had kindled a fire in the
[51:59] midst of the hall and were set down
[52:00] together peter sat down among them but a
[52:03] certain maid beheld him as they sat as
[52:06] he sat by the fire and earnestly looked
[52:09] on him and said this man was also with
[52:12] him and he denied him saying woman
[52:15] i know him not now it's incredible what
[52:19] happened to the faith that peter had
[52:22] that we just read about when peter's
[52:24] saying lord i'll never be offended in
[52:26] you lord i'll i'll never deny you it was
[52:30] it was it sounded very reasonable
[52:33] sounded like peter was really zealous
[52:36] for what he believed what happens to the
[52:38] faith that peter has when he's saying
[52:41] lord i'll never be offended in you i'll
[52:43] never though though i'd lord
[52:45] i'll die with you before i before i i
[52:48] ever deny you
[52:50] what happens to that faith is when faith
[52:53] when when that type of faith that peter
[52:55] has is put under pressure ah it changes
[52:58] very quickly
[53:00] because now you take the same man who is
[53:03] saying lord i'll never deny you uh uh
[53:05] though i die with you and it sounds
[53:07] zealous and it sounds real but the
[53:10] problem is is that peter only had an
[53:13] intellectual level of faith or believing
[53:16] and he didn't really have a true
[53:18] revelation at this point now it's
[53:20] important that you have an intellectual
[53:22] understanding of who jesus is
[53:25] it's important and it really it starts
[53:27] there i almost
[53:29] titled this sermon from your head to
[53:31] your heart
[53:33] because it has the start in your mind
[53:35] you've got it has to everything with the
[53:37] lord always starts in the flesh
[53:40] i started this sermon in the flesh i'm
[53:43] preaching to you now what we believe in
[53:45] by by faith and by prayers that we all
[53:48] came in here this morning in the flesh
[53:50] all of us begin to worship brother tony
[53:52] does what he does the music does what
[53:54] they do you do what you do and we start
[53:56] in the flesh but but what we're doing is
[53:59] we're pressing to say lord we're doing
[54:01] all this in the mechanics so that you
[54:03] can come down with an anointing and send
[54:06] the dynamics and take us out of the
[54:08] flesh and into the spirit
[54:11] so everything as as i said starts in the
[54:14] flesh it's always got to start from
[54:17] somewhere and i just feel pulled
[54:19] just pulled in many directions and so i
[54:21] just want to maybe just
[54:23] not not not glaze right over this but i
[54:26] i want to make sure that i i don't miss
[54:28] what the lord wants to say
[54:30] uh how can it as we said here when you
[54:33] preach when you open your bible when you
[54:35] start speaking you're you're in the
[54:37] flesh
[54:38] you're in a very intellectual natural
[54:40] realm when you begin to praise and you
[54:42] begin to worship and you begin to sing
[54:45] you start in the flesh you start in the
[54:48] human mind you start in the intellect
[54:50] but it shouldn't stay there
[54:52] the spirit should come in and take over
[54:54] oh i say god if you could do anything
[54:57] come and take over this service right
[54:59] now
[55:00] come and take over what i start in the
[55:02] flesh and let your spirit come and take
[55:04] control
[55:05] you start to witness to somebody and you
[55:07] start to share the the the the message
[55:09] of the hour with them or start just to
[55:11] start with something small to somebody
[55:14] you just a lot of times don't have some
[55:16] lightning strike lightning bolt
[55:18] anointing that comes to you and gives
[55:20] you a word and you just feel
[55:22] you know charged and you sort of feel
[55:23] like you're
[55:24] super spiritual and you just begin to
[55:26] speak and you begin to tell them about
[55:28] the message no that really friends if
[55:30] we'd be honest that never really happens
[55:32] but it starts very much in the flesh but
[55:35] jesus said take no thought for what
[55:38] you'll say
[55:39] at that moment because the spirit comes
[55:42] and takes over our words and what we can
[55:44] do in the flesh god can bring glory by
[55:47] taking control
[55:49] in the spirit
[55:51] so you must the bible says you must call
[55:53] upon the name of the lord
[55:55] to be saved what does that mean it
[55:57] starts in the
[56:00] flesh we're gonna just if you could put
[56:03] the powerpoint up i'm just gonna read
[56:04] this so you know where my title comes
[56:06] from and then we'll come back to this
[56:08] i want you to notice here what brother
[56:10] branham says
[56:11] uh i've titled this the order of the
[56:13] anointing if you just go to the first
[56:15] slide he says see how the holy spirit
[56:17] can anoint a man
[56:19] but it's got to be in the order of the
[56:22] anointing
[56:24] the outside spirit can be anointed with
[56:28] the holy ghost and the soul as dark as
[56:31] pitch
[56:33] the cockle barrel grows on the same
[56:35] water that builds puts life into the
[56:38] wheat puts life into the cockleburn
[56:41] but at the bottom of the cuckoo bird
[56:43] here's the difference it's a cockabur
[56:46] life
[56:48] so the same water or the same anointing
[56:51] that anoints the wheat also anoints the
[56:54] tear
[56:55] right
[56:57] this is going to be very elementary but
[56:59] it's also going to just be very
[57:01] foundational to what we have to say so
[57:03] the same water that anoints the tear
[57:06] also anoints the wheat brother branham
[57:07] says it's got to be in the order of the
[57:11] anointing how can the holy spirit anoint
[57:12] to man it's got to be in the order of
[57:15] the anointing the outside spirit can be
[57:18] anointed with the holy ghost and the
[57:19] soul is darkest pitch the cockapoo grows
[57:22] on the same water that builds that puts
[57:24] life into the wheat puts life into the
[57:26] cockapoo but at the bottom of the
[57:28] cockapoo it's a cockapoo life it's
[57:30] rejoicing and blooming and got life
[57:35] and doing
[57:36] everything that the wheat does but the
[57:40] soul of it is cockleburn wow
[57:45] now you say brother matt how can you
[57:47] tell the difference brother baron i'm
[57:48] even in
[57:49] there and and uh forget what what the
[57:51] the name of the city who was therein and
[57:55] he's he's there preaching or they're
[57:57] watching at a revival meeting and he
[57:59] tells the story of the man who comes up
[58:01] to him and shakes his hand and he says
[58:03] this man just spoke in tongues he said
[58:05] aw i was just admiring the way that the
[58:07] spirit of the lord used him and he says
[58:09] just at that moment he goes outside and
[58:11] he shakes his hand and the lord he falls
[58:14] into discernment and sees that this man
[58:16] is living with another woman that's not
[58:18] his wife
[58:20] and the prophet of god says i don't
[58:21] understand what's i just watched this
[58:24] man speak in tongues be yielded unto the
[58:27] holy spirit and watched a real gift
[58:29] operate in his life but he's living
[58:32] with another woman
[58:35] brother branham gets troubled goes to
[58:37] his caving greens meal and he's there
[58:38] praying asking god about this and the
[58:41] lord gives him the scripture in hebrews
[58:43] 6 for the rain
[58:44] falls on the just
[58:46] and the unjust
[58:48] the same water the same anointing it's
[58:51] all the order of anointing it can anoint
[58:54] your flesh and you be in the spirit and
[58:57] you shout you speak in tongues you raise
[58:59] your hands you get excited you get
[59:02] emotional and brother brandon makes a
[59:04] statement he says and you can cry real
[59:07] tears and it not be the holy spirit at
[59:11] all
[59:12] [Music]
[59:13] it's all the order of the anointing it's
[59:16] a cocklebur that's trying to do god of
[59:18] service without his will if you go to
[59:19] the next slide here um
[59:22] on he says see false teachers can rise
[59:25] teaching all kinds of trinitarianism and
[59:28] everything else and be anointed with the
[59:31] holy ghost
[59:33] and perform just as many miracles as the
[59:37] true gospel can amen but by the word
[59:41] here that's what it does see what i
[59:44] mean brother man says so false teachers
[59:47] can rise there can come a true anointing
[59:50] that starts on the flesh what did peter
[59:52] have that wasn't sufficient to withstand
[59:56] the pressure
[1:00:00] because whatever happens
[1:00:02] from from the book of matthew then we
[1:00:04] read over in the book of luke and
[1:00:06] peter's saying in matthew lord i'll
[1:00:08] never deny you i'll go all the way to
[1:00:10] the death i i'll stand with you
[1:00:13] you know
[1:00:14] i'll i'll oh i'll i'll die with you lord
[1:00:17] i'll never be offended in you i'll never
[1:00:19] deny you and now here he stands
[1:00:22] and we're reading it and the bible says
[1:00:24] a woman says
[1:00:25] if you could turn there in your bible he
[1:00:28] says that he denied him verse 57 of luke
[1:00:30] 22
[1:00:31] saying woman
[1:00:33] i know him not
[1:00:36] and after a little while another saw him
[1:00:38] and said thou art also of them and peter
[1:00:41] said man
[1:00:43] i am not
[1:00:47] what happened
[1:00:48] amen anointed in the flesh
[1:00:51] but never changed in the soul
[1:00:55] are you with me here this morning
[1:00:57] anointed in the flesh
[1:00:59] but never changed in the soul turn to
[1:01:02] the book of james you know the scripture
[1:01:04] very well
[1:01:05] thou believest
[1:01:07] i want you to look here in james chapter
[1:01:08] 2 verse 19 very familiar
[1:01:12] james chapter 2 verse 19 keep your bible
[1:01:14] just handy this morning we're going to
[1:01:16] use it a lot and i want them to be able
[1:01:17] to keep the slides on without having to
[1:01:19] go back and forth
[1:01:21] james chapter 2 verse 19 thou believest
[1:01:25] that there is one god
[1:01:27] thou doest
[1:01:28] well
[1:01:29] the devils
[1:01:31] also believe
[1:01:33] amen and tremble now this word is
[1:01:36] pisturio in the greek and i didn't have
[1:01:38] time to put it on the slide
[1:01:40] but i'm just going to read you this
[1:01:42] meaning when he says thou
[1:01:44] believest
[1:01:45] that there is one god
[1:01:47] thou doest well
[1:01:49] the devils also believe
[1:01:53] and
[1:01:54] tremble
[1:01:57] the devils believe the message as much
[1:01:58] as you are more than you believe it here
[1:02:00] today there's a lot of people that have
[1:02:01] disbelieved the message and left the
[1:02:03] message i can promise you there's not
[1:02:04] been one devil that has denied the
[1:02:07] message
[1:02:09] not one
[1:02:11] not one has walked away from it not one
[1:02:13] has caught him a liar or a
[1:02:15] or a dishonest person i promise you not
[1:02:17] one of them
[1:02:19] it's incredible you go back and ask you
[1:02:21] go back and ask the cancer demon what
[1:02:23] you think of william branham you get a
[1:02:25] very different website than the websites
[1:02:27] who talk about william branham today go
[1:02:29] ask a demon of tuberculosis about what
[1:02:32] they think of william branham
[1:02:35] it's it'd be like sort of like if there
[1:02:37] was no record of any of mike tyson's
[1:02:39] fights and all we ever had today was
[1:02:41] just the stories of mike tyson it'd be
[1:02:43] one thing for me to get up here and tell
[1:02:44] you you know mike was really nothing i
[1:02:47] could i honestly i could have took mike
[1:02:50] mike was really nothing you know they
[1:02:52] talk about his punch in his right hand
[1:02:54] and the left hook but you know his jab
[1:02:56] it really wasn't that good guys i mean
[1:02:58] i'm telling you if there was no proof if
[1:03:00] we didn't have videos of what to watch a
[1:03:02] mike tyson fight
[1:03:05] but i promise you if you take one of
[1:03:07] those men that he ko'd
[1:03:10] and you put him here behind this pulpit
[1:03:11] and say hey was mike tyson all that i
[1:03:14] promised you you'd get a different story
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:18] amen
[1:03:21] so he says thou believers that there is
[1:03:23] one god you do well the devil's also
[1:03:26] pisturio
[1:03:28] this is what it means to have
[1:03:30] faith
[1:03:32] the devils have
[1:03:34] faith oh yeah amen
[1:03:37] you see there's a difference between a
[1:03:39] faith which is a revelation
[1:03:42] and a faith which is an intellectual
[1:03:44] starting in the flesh had knowledge
[1:03:48] and you say but matter we're preaching
[1:03:49] against intellect no i'm not here today
[1:03:51] i'm telling you you've got to have an
[1:03:52] intellectual experience
[1:03:54] you've got to have something that starts
[1:03:56] in your mind that's right but it can't
[1:03:59] stay there
[1:04:01] or else you'll end up just like peter
[1:04:03] i'll never deny you lord i'll never walk
[1:04:05] away from you and then let the flames
[1:04:07] get higher and the heat start rising
[1:04:10] and that that intellectual faith will
[1:04:13] never hold you
[1:04:16] i'm afraid that's what's happened to
[1:04:17] many people who's left the truth they
[1:04:19] only ever had
[1:04:21] a peter intellectual faith where they
[1:04:24] believed
[1:04:26] but it never went from their head down
[1:04:28] into their heart
[1:04:30] to their soul
[1:04:32] you say brother matt why is that
[1:04:33] important because it's so important that
[1:04:35] we raise our children it's important to
[1:04:38] teach them the truth it's important that
[1:04:40] they believe the message it's important
[1:04:43] that they believe who god has sent i
[1:04:45] believe who god has sinned you know
[1:04:46] brother branham says you know the true
[1:04:48] evidence of the holy ghost is accepting
[1:04:50] uh the truth for your for your age
[1:04:53] i 100 believe that but i'm going to tell
[1:04:55] you what that is more of just because
[1:04:57] you accept the truth of your age does
[1:04:59] not mean you're born of the spirit of
[1:05:01] god
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:02] amen i can tell you what it is it's a
[1:05:04] direct evidence that you've never been
[1:05:06] born again if you don't accept the truth
[1:05:08] for your age
[1:05:09] [Applause]
[1:05:11] it's a direct evidence you don't but if
[1:05:13] a person you telling me the people
[1:05:15] who've walked away from the message
[1:05:16] didn't believe
[1:05:19] telling me the devils didn't believe but
[1:05:21] james tells us that they did believe
[1:05:24] in so much that they trembled
[1:05:26] so it's got to move from an intellectual
[1:05:29] conception or a mental a mental ascent
[1:05:33] or agreement with the word and it's got
[1:05:35] to drop from your head down into your
[1:05:38] heart and a true revelation brother
[1:05:40] branham says faith is a true revelation
[1:05:43] from god faith is not something that you
[1:05:45] work up faith is not such what people
[1:05:47] talk about blind faith you know faith is
[1:05:50] not blind faith you don't just say well
[1:05:52] you know i i don't know i'm just gonna
[1:05:54] try this i'm just gonna guess at it and
[1:05:56] i'm just gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna take
[1:05:58] a chance at this that's not true faith
[1:06:00] true faith is a revelation
[1:06:02] it's something that's revealed to you
[1:06:04] and jesus said the gates of hell can't
[1:06:06] take it away from you
[1:06:08] hello
[1:06:10] they believe to have faith
[1:06:13] this is what it means here pisturio and
[1:06:15] the greek thou believeth there is one
[1:06:18] god thou do well the devils also have
[1:06:22] faith
[1:06:23] to give credit
[1:06:24] to give respect to a person or a thing
[1:06:27] to entrust people say that all the time
[1:06:30] i've trusted the lord well it's a good
[1:06:32] thing that you've trusted the lord
[1:06:34] but has the author of the book not just
[1:06:38] the book been made known unto you amen
[1:06:42] there's a very big difference as brother
[1:06:44] branham said to know his word and to
[1:06:46] know him
[1:06:48] to know him as life can you say amen
[1:06:51] it means to have faith by implication to
[1:06:54] entrust
[1:06:57] to believe
[1:06:58] to put trust with
[1:07:01] to have faith in so peter believed
[1:07:04] so much until the pressure came and he
[1:07:08] denied that he knew him let's look a
[1:07:10] little bit further here it's amazing
[1:07:12] when i read this in matthew 26 and i
[1:07:14] just hear the words in math in luke 22
[1:07:16] when i just hear the words in matthew 16
[1:07:19] and peter's vehemently saying i'll never
[1:07:21] deny you lord
[1:07:22] i'll stand with you
[1:07:25] verse 57 and he denied him saying woman
[1:07:29] i know him not and after a little while
[1:07:31] another saw him and said thou art also
[1:07:33] of them and peter said man i am not and
[1:07:35] about the space of one hour this is
[1:07:37] verse 59
[1:07:39] after another
[1:07:41] most people don't have their bibles so
[1:07:42] put that up for me if you could brother
[1:07:44] caleb and that's that's that's that's
[1:07:45] fine i just want to make sure we read
[1:07:47] this luke 22 we're going to wait and
[1:07:49] have this on the screen i just feel
[1:07:51] impressed by the holy spirit so that you
[1:07:53] read this
[1:07:55] lemon is going to back up as he's
[1:07:56] finding in luke chapter 22
[1:07:59] and he denied him verse 57 saying woman
[1:08:02] i know him not
[1:08:04] luke 22 brother caleb verse 57
[1:08:07] verse 58 and after a little while
[1:08:08] another saw him and said thou art also
[1:08:10] then peter said man i am not about the
[1:08:12] space verse 59 of one hour after another
[1:08:15] confidently affirmed sin of a truth this
[1:08:18] fellow also was with him for he is a
[1:08:20] galilean
[1:08:22] and peter said man
[1:08:24] i
[1:08:25] know
[1:08:26] not what thou sayest
[1:08:33] and immediately
[1:08:34] while he yet spake the crew
[1:08:38] and the lord turned and looked upon
[1:08:40] peter
[1:08:41] and peter remembered the word of the
[1:08:43] lord
[1:08:44] how he had said unto him before the
[1:08:47] crow thou shalt deny me thrice
[1:08:50] and peter went out and wept bitterly
[1:08:55] amen so something happens with an
[1:08:58] anointing that comes upon peter
[1:09:00] and he's so anointed with the power of
[1:09:03] god that he could say i'll never deny
[1:09:05] you lord i'll never walk away from you
[1:09:07] i'll go all the way to death i'll i'll
[1:09:10] go to the grave for you but when it
[1:09:11] really came the testing time his faith
[1:09:15] didn't
[1:09:16] hold him demas was the same exact way
[1:09:18] who walked with paul we can give example
[1:09:20] after example demas was the same exact
[1:09:23] way who had walked with paul in his
[1:09:25] entire ministry had watched the miracles
[1:09:27] had sat in the revivals had sat in the
[1:09:29] meetings
[1:09:30] but brother adam says but there was
[1:09:32] something he says demas wasn't a
[1:09:33] hypocrite that's what the prophet of god
[1:09:35] said he said he said but something in
[1:09:37] him looked at paul's ministry and said
[1:09:40] you know
[1:09:41] paul's just washed up
[1:09:44] it's easy to accept the word when the
[1:09:46] rest of the world is accepting the word
[1:09:49] it's very easy to accept paul when he's
[1:09:52] renowned jesus when he's multitudes are
[1:09:54] following him and man his ministry is
[1:09:56] just growing and we're on the front row
[1:09:58] man i just i'm right here with this i
[1:10:00] stand with this i'm identified with it i
[1:10:02] believe it yeah everyone else does too
[1:10:06] amen
[1:10:07] amen
[1:10:10] but watch what happens when that word
[1:10:12] becomes not so popular
[1:10:15] and jesus says unless you eat the flesh
[1:10:18] of the son of man and drink his blood
[1:10:19] you have no part with him and many of
[1:10:21] them said this is a hard saying who can
[1:10:24] bear this
[1:10:26] and the bible says many of them that had
[1:10:28] walked with him walk no no more amen
[1:10:32] and then jesus says
[1:10:34] will you go also
[1:10:37] everyone else is leaving the entire
[1:10:39] church could you imagine you say brother
[1:10:40] man i've heard this a million times well
[1:10:42] let me just let me just bring it let me
[1:10:44] just bring it in the way maybe that
[1:10:45] you've never thought of could you
[1:10:46] imagine if we if we preach something
[1:10:48] here today you were in a church here
[1:10:50] this morning and everyone in this entire
[1:10:54] building and church left
[1:10:59] everyone walked away
[1:11:01] it's one thing for one family here and
[1:11:02] one family there but the entire church
[1:11:04] let's make it larger the entire you're
[1:11:06] in a church with 500 people and
[1:11:10] 488 of them get up and walk out
[1:11:13] amen
[1:11:17] and then jesus
[1:11:19] as the door closes looks at you and says
[1:11:21] what are you doing here
[1:11:24] won't you go also
[1:11:27] won't you leave also
[1:11:29] where else would we go lord
[1:11:31] [Applause]
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:33] where else could we go
[1:11:38] hallelujah
[1:11:40] it's incredible how faith intellect
[1:11:42] works and i'm going to get to this if
[1:11:44] you have the powerpoint you can go just
[1:11:45] a little bit further
[1:11:47] uh oh and just display the next the the
[1:11:50] next slide there he says as i've often
[1:11:53] said
[1:11:54] i found two classes of people one of
[1:11:56] them is the fundamental let's go beyond
[1:11:58] this and go all the way to the very
[1:12:00] first uh just go to the very keep going
[1:12:02] past that that slide there i just want
[1:12:04] to get to something i'm not going to
[1:12:06] nearly be able to cover all of this one
[1:12:07] more keep going
[1:12:10] keep going one more
[1:12:12] keep going keep going keep going
[1:12:15] rationalism there we go
[1:12:18] jesus is asked this question even by
[1:12:20] pontius pilate and he's he's asked the
[1:12:23] question what is truth it's incredible
[1:12:26] because
[1:12:27] truth you could say is the absolute
[1:12:29] standard by which everything in reality
[1:12:32] is measured truth in the view of any
[1:12:34] subject no matter what subject
[1:12:36] you want to debate or speak about here
[1:12:39] today uh any situation any question or
[1:12:42] idea and so they that we define this as
[1:12:45] the truth to matter and pila asked this
[1:12:48] question and said what is what is truth
[1:12:50] now the quest the wrong question was
[1:12:52] asked wasn't what is truth the right
[1:12:54] question is who is truth because truth
[1:12:57] is not an idea or something scholarly
[1:13:00] that you figure out truth is a person
[1:13:02] that's revealed to you
[1:13:05] and so truth is the absolute standard
[1:13:07] but truth is not what a scholar it's not
[1:13:09] what a theologian it's not what a
[1:13:11] preacher it's not what anyone it's not
[1:13:13] what i say to you here today is not what
[1:13:17] truth is truth is truth amen
[1:13:21] and the message let me just bring it a
[1:13:22] little bit further the message is not
[1:13:24] the message of the hour is not what i
[1:13:27] not what you not what any other person
[1:13:29] makes it or preaches it as dogmatic as
[1:13:31] they can sound and they are the end-all
[1:13:34] uh to end-all discussions i'm preaching
[1:13:36] the truth and it's the end-all
[1:13:38] my interpretation of what brother
[1:13:39] branham says is the end-all solution
[1:13:42] it's the it's the it's the finality
[1:13:44] doesn't matter if a man says that that
[1:13:45] doesn't make it true
[1:13:47] let me say it this way the truth speaks
[1:13:49] for itself
[1:13:50] [Music]
[1:13:53] and it doesn't need a preacher an
[1:13:54] interpreter to tell you what it means
[1:13:56] it speaks for itself
[1:13:59] can you say amen
[1:14:00] and so the message is not what i'm
[1:14:02] making it's not what any man makes it
[1:14:04] the message is what it is it's not the
[1:14:06] message of brother branham either you
[1:14:08] see him was it the message of william
[1:14:10] branham that's why a lot of people have
[1:14:13] have a misunderstanding the message of
[1:14:14] the hour was not the message of william
[1:14:16] branham he was the messenger that
[1:14:18] brought the message from jesus christ as
[1:14:20] the book of revelations was not the book
[1:14:22] that john wrote john was not the author
[1:14:25] john was just the scribe the author who
[1:14:27] wrote the book was jesus himself
[1:14:30] and the prophet of god was not the
[1:14:32] author of the message he was just the
[1:14:34] mailman the messenger who was vindicated
[1:14:37] not so that you'd have faith in a man
[1:14:40] but that you'd have faith that that
[1:14:41] message that man brought was from the
[1:14:43] throne of god
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:46] and so the message brother branham
[1:14:49] he was not let me just say it this way
[1:14:51] brother branham was not who i say he was
[1:14:53] it's not who you say he was
[1:14:55] it's not what any man says he was he was
[1:14:58] who the word
[1:14:59] said he was yes
[1:15:02] amen that's good
[1:15:04] hallelujah what is truth it's the word
[1:15:07] which is the thought of god expressed
[1:15:11] it's communicated
[1:15:12] not by human
[1:15:14] not by a human dialect or a human
[1:15:17] language
[1:15:18] because a human cannot with his own
[1:15:21] words let me be careful how i say this i
[1:15:24] could try to get you to understand it i
[1:15:26] could teach it to you you could
[1:15:28] intellectually understand it you could
[1:15:30] intellectually ah ha now i understand i
[1:15:32] get it two plus two equals four and a
[1:15:35] lot of people have that kind of
[1:15:38] understanding of the message of what
[1:15:39] happened in the in the garden of eden
[1:15:41] that it was sex and it wasn't an apple
[1:15:43] it was adultery it wasn't a uh some
[1:15:45] fruit that we can understand that
[1:15:47] intellectually but i can't reveal to you
[1:15:50] the true revelation of the message only
[1:15:53] god himself can do that that's why the
[1:15:56] prophet of god says above everything
[1:15:57] else you should pray for true revelation
[1:16:01] in your life for with true revelation
[1:16:03] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:16:05] it
[1:16:06] amen
[1:16:07] and so what is the word it's the thought
[1:16:09] of god expressed
[1:16:11] god is a god of truth the bible says the
[1:16:15] spirit of god is the spirit of truth
[1:16:17] jesus says i am the way i am the truth i
[1:16:21] am the life so god only functions in the
[1:16:25] realm of truth whereas evil the evil one
[1:16:28] our enemy the bible calls him the father
[1:16:31] of lies
[1:16:32] he's the father of distortions
[1:16:35] and brother branham says what satan's
[1:16:37] job is is to take the pure truth and
[1:16:40] distort it or deform it he won't come
[1:16:43] right out and have you deny it he'll
[1:16:45] give you a distorted view of something
[1:16:48] amen so the spiritual battle that we're
[1:16:51] in is a battle between lies and truth
[1:16:59] many times in our spiritual war we get
[1:17:01] everybody else's view of a matter
[1:17:03] including their own and our own opinion
[1:17:05] and we may even have all of the facts
[1:17:07] but you can have the fact of the gospel
[1:17:10] and not have the gospel
[1:17:12] you could have the truth of the
[1:17:14] revelation and not have the revelation
[1:17:17] that's a direct quote from god's prophet
[1:17:19] he says you can take the truth of the
[1:17:21] revelation and miss the revelation
[1:17:23] entirely
[1:17:25] so it's not a human understanding it's
[1:17:27] not something that we learn or that
[1:17:28] we're tall right or that we read in the
[1:17:30] book say brother matt are those things
[1:17:32] wrong know those that's where it always
[1:17:34] starts
[1:17:36] but i don't just want to start i want to
[1:17:38] finish
[1:17:41] and so it's amazing because you can have
[1:17:43] all the information
[1:17:45] but miss the truth
[1:17:47] you could have all of the emotions
[1:17:50] feelings or sensations
[1:17:53] but not have the truth oh i thought it
[1:17:55] was in if i felt him no it's not just in
[1:17:57] filling him all right amen
[1:17:59] i'm sorry to have you do acrobatics
[1:18:01] brother caleb but go back to the quotes
[1:18:02] i just
[1:18:04] want to go back to what you had on the
[1:18:06] third slide i think it was brother caleb
[1:18:07] this powerpoint you just had
[1:18:10] you can have all of the emotions go to
[1:18:12] the next ones here listen what brother
[1:18:13] brandon says i've often said i found two
[1:18:14] classes of people one of them is the
[1:18:17] fundamental positionally he knows where
[1:18:20] he is in christ because of the word but
[1:18:23] he doesn't have any faith in what he is
[1:18:25] doing he hasn't received the holy spirit
[1:18:28] then i find the pentecostals many of
[1:18:31] them has received the holy ghost but
[1:18:33] don't know who they are
[1:18:35] just like a man who's got money in the
[1:18:37] bank and can't write a check and the
[1:18:39] other one can write a check and got no
[1:18:41] money in the bank
[1:18:44] [Applause]
[1:18:47] go to the next try new god of service
[1:18:48] the next slide there just keep advancing
[1:18:51] he says if you could get those two
[1:18:53] together
[1:18:55] if you could get the pentecostal to
[1:18:57] realize who he is and come back to the
[1:19:00] real full word of god with the baptism
[1:19:02] of the holy ghost it'll set the world of
[1:19:04] fire again with a new pentecostal
[1:19:06] revival brother sister that's true
[1:19:09] listen he says that's the way it is
[1:19:10] tonight this is then jesus came
[1:19:13] people would rather stay in an old stale
[1:19:15] formal ungodly and different condition
[1:19:18] than to put up with a little wildfire
[1:19:20] now and then
[1:19:21] i'd rather have it a thousand to one
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:25] brother bannon says i'd rather have a
[1:19:27] little bit of wildfire than no fire a
[1:19:30] thousand to one
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:33] they feel better at home with the devils
[1:19:36] and their old condition drinking smoking
[1:19:37] gambling wearing old dirty clothes
[1:19:39] bobbing off their hair and doing all
[1:19:41] this other stuff that they do feel more
[1:19:43] at home doing that than you would than
[1:19:45] you do to be cold old-fashioned and have
[1:19:48] jesus around the house i'll take him a
[1:19:50] hundred billion times to one
[1:19:53] amen
[1:19:54] advance that slide for me brother caleb
[1:19:57] he says and that's the way it is he says
[1:19:58] when a man is converted did you go too
[1:20:00] far go back one i don't have it here i
[1:20:02] wish that i did go back one slide one
[1:20:04] slide
[1:20:06] yeah
[1:20:07] okay go to the next one that's good
[1:20:09] when a man is converted his eyes are set
[1:20:11] towards calvary this is surge we would
[1:20:13] see jesus
[1:20:16] he says when a man is converted his eyes
[1:20:18] are set towards calvary if he's just a
[1:20:20] little bit nervous if you don't watch
[1:20:23] him
[1:20:24] he will go over to the fanatic side
[1:20:28] if he's just a little scholarly he'll go
[1:20:30] over to the starchy side
[1:20:33] but right in the middle of the road
[1:20:36] is the same sensible born-again
[1:20:39] spirit-led endowed church of the living
[1:20:41] god
[1:20:42] going straight down the road to christ
[1:20:46] that's the real coming from both
[1:20:49] sides
[1:20:51] one went one way
[1:20:53] and one with the other
[1:20:55] shows fanaticism or either scholarly and
[1:20:58] too stiff to bow so either you got this
[1:21:01] ditch or you got this ditch and brother
[1:21:03] branham says i always stood in the
[1:21:05] middle of the two when he speaks of
[1:21:07] armenianism and calvinism and preaches
[1:21:09] how the calvinism has just been so
[1:21:11] predestinated they can't well if god
[1:21:13] wants to send a revival then he'll send
[1:21:15] it there's nothing we can do to cause it
[1:21:17] there's nothing we can do to ask for it
[1:21:18] you ought not even ask everything's just
[1:21:21] predestinated all ready to happen is
[1:21:23] what's going to happen we don't need to
[1:21:25] do anything we just sit here starchy
[1:21:27] cold formal and just repeat the word of
[1:21:29] god and if god wants to send a revival
[1:21:31] he'll send the holy ghost revival
[1:21:33] brother adam says now some of that is
[1:21:36] true
[1:21:38] he says but it goes off too far to seed
[1:21:41] on one side
[1:21:43] and then they go in the ditch
[1:21:45] and he says then you get the fanatics
[1:21:47] over here that believe unless you shout
[1:21:49] or speak in tongues you haven't even had
[1:21:51] a revival
[1:21:53] right
[1:21:55] and it's a ditch on this side
[1:21:58] brother madam says they go to the
[1:21:59] fanatic side and he says shows
[1:22:00] fanaticism are either scholarly to sift
[1:22:03] about next slide
[1:22:05] and he says they know more
[1:22:07] about the word
[1:22:09] then they know about the author
[1:22:11] to know the words not life but to know
[1:22:15] him
[1:22:17] to know him
[1:22:18] you don't have to be a scholar i'm so
[1:22:20] glad
[1:22:21] i don't have to be a scholar
[1:22:23] you have to be a
[1:22:25] submitted
[1:22:27] person
[1:22:30] you have to be a submitted
[1:22:33] person don't get so shy don't get so
[1:22:36] excited when he says you don't have to
[1:22:37] be a scholar
[1:22:39] i don't have to do anything i don't have
[1:22:40] to know anything i'm just in it i felt i
[1:22:43] felt something brother adam says it's
[1:22:44] not an emotion it's not because you
[1:22:46] spoke in tongues it's not because you
[1:22:48] shouted that may be all right but
[1:22:50] because you're a submitted person i love
[1:22:52] that amen and when you submit yourself
[1:22:55] to christ christ is obligated to feel
[1:22:57] that vacancy that you've poured out on
[1:22:59] the altar to him he's obligated to his
[1:23:01] word to do it he will not fail you amen
[1:23:06] not because you had an understanding of
[1:23:08] something you so rationalized it and you
[1:23:10] got the perfect seals over here in the
[1:23:12] trumpets and the vials and you've got it
[1:23:13] all on a chalkboard and you understand
[1:23:15] all the mysteries and you're under paul
[1:23:16] said though i know all the
[1:23:18] mysteries but you can still miss
[1:23:20] something and it's not because you were
[1:23:22] on this ditch and you shouted and you
[1:23:24] spoke in tongues or you you got some
[1:23:26] emotional experience that's good both
[1:23:28] are good
[1:23:30] but in the middle of the road is
[1:23:32] truth go to the next line
[1:23:35] and he says the methodists said when we
[1:23:37] shouted we had it but they didn't
[1:23:40] the nazarene said when they lived holy
[1:23:42] they had it but they didn't amen the
[1:23:45] pentecostal said we speak in tongues we
[1:23:48] got it
[1:23:50] but they didn't
[1:23:51] so wait a minute what is left brother
[1:23:53] branham
[1:23:54] what is left when we shouted we had it
[1:23:57] no we didn't have it no you didn't have
[1:23:59] it when you shouted
[1:24:01] okay then it must be when i live holy
[1:24:03] enough
[1:24:06] no
[1:24:07] no you didn't have it you didn't
[1:24:08] necessarily have you may you may shout
[1:24:11] you may live holy yeah but that don't
[1:24:13] mean you got it amen
[1:24:16] and he says the pentecostal says we
[1:24:18] speak in tongues we got it
[1:24:20] but they didn't see
[1:24:23] next slide
[1:24:25] god unfolded himself
[1:24:27] not
[1:24:28] in
[1:24:29] sensations right amen not
[1:24:32] in
[1:24:34] sensations
[1:24:36] not
[1:24:37] in
[1:24:38] sensations
[1:24:39] you know the quote very well brother
[1:24:41] branham says the one of the mysteries
[1:24:42] that was revealed by the baptism of the
[1:24:44] holy ghost he says was the baptism of
[1:24:46] the holy ghost
[1:24:48] without sensation now one ditch will
[1:24:50] take that so far and say see there to be
[1:24:53] born again i don't have to have any
[1:24:55] sensations whatsoever and i can receive
[1:24:57] the holy ghost and never even know it
[1:24:59] just sit in the church long enough like
[1:25:01] being in a car if i sit in a garage long
[1:25:03] enough i'll eventually be a car
[1:25:09] it's not by osmosis
[1:25:11] osmosis is just if you sit in an
[1:25:13] atmosphere long enough you'll just
[1:25:15] suddenly magically if i just go to
[1:25:17] church and i pay my tithes and i'm holy
[1:25:19] i follow all the rules and do everything
[1:25:21] that the message tells me to do and i
[1:25:23] check off that and check off that and
[1:25:24] check off that and check off that you
[1:25:26] know what your resume
[1:25:28] your resume is as good as your resume
[1:25:30] matches the devils
[1:25:37] you feel good
[1:25:42] could i imagine i heard her brother say
[1:25:44] just just the other day so you imagine
[1:25:46] he said a lot of these he says you take
[1:25:49] all the all the check marks of the devil
[1:25:50] you believe malachi 4 ah i do believe it
[1:25:53] with all my heart check you believe god
[1:25:55] sent a prophet check i believe it with
[1:25:57] all my heart
[1:26:00] you believe luke 17 30 was malachi 4 was
[1:26:03] the prophet of god was william branham i
[1:26:05] believe it with all of my heart but you
[1:26:06] believe that the original sin was
[1:26:08] adultery and it wasn't an apple i
[1:26:09] believe it with all of my heart i accept
[1:26:12] it 100 you don't believe in a trinity
[1:26:14] absolutely not you believe in one god
[1:26:16] absolutely not you know the brother said
[1:26:18] many people would take that man and
[1:26:20] elect him as their pastor
[1:26:23] and i've just read you the
[1:26:24] qualifications of lucifer
[1:26:26] yeah
[1:26:26] wow
[1:26:28] i believe it wow
[1:26:30] peter said i believe it i'll stand with
[1:26:32] it it's one thing to have a confession
[1:26:34] from your mouth and have a life that's
[1:26:37] submitted to the word
[1:26:40] there's a very big difference in saying
[1:26:42] you believe something and watching your
[1:26:44] life submit itself to what you say you
[1:26:46] believe
[1:26:48] now that's what the prophet of god
[1:26:51] taught us
[1:26:52] it's not in emotions it's not in head
[1:26:54] knowledge or intellect
[1:26:56] it's in a submitted
[1:26:59] life
[1:27:01] that you submit yourself to the word of
[1:27:03] god
[1:27:04] you say brother brother matt what does
[1:27:06] that mean it means i've submitted myself
[1:27:08] i've became subservient
[1:27:10] to the word that's been revealed amen
[1:27:14] that means all of my ideas i've
[1:27:16] throughout the window all of my opinions
[1:27:18] i've thrown out the window all of what i
[1:27:20] think i've thrown out the window
[1:27:23] and i've submitted myself to him who god
[1:27:26] has sent
[1:27:28] [Music]
[1:27:30] hello
[1:27:32] it's very different when you say you
[1:27:34] believe the message of the hour that god
[1:27:36] sent through william branham and when
[1:27:37] you actually submit yourself
[1:27:41] to that message that was sent yeah amen
[1:27:44] you see the devil can believe but he
[1:27:46] can't submit himself to the word
[1:27:48] the devil can say i accept that god sent
[1:27:50] a prophet but he will never submit
[1:27:52] himself or surrender himself to what
[1:27:55] that message brought
[1:27:56] and many people are willing to say they
[1:27:58] accept a creed or a dogma or an idea or
[1:28:01] a theology or a doctrine and i'm so
[1:28:03] afraid we teach our children the truth
[1:28:06] and it's good to teach them the truth oh
[1:28:08] my brother and my sister but i want to
[1:28:10] make sure that that truth becomes a
[1:28:12] revelation and if anything i could pray
[1:28:14] for my children and say lord don't let
[1:28:16] me just teach them a dress code because
[1:28:18] they'll go out into the world and find a
[1:28:20] dress code they like a lot better don't
[1:28:22] let me just teach them a lifestyle
[1:28:24] listen the message is not a lifestyle
[1:28:26] the message is not just a doctrine of
[1:28:28] books and tapes and ideas and theology
[1:28:30] and doctrines it's a person that's
[1:28:33] personally revealed to you and when god
[1:28:36] reveals himself to you nobody can take
[1:28:38] that away i say god give us a group of
[1:28:41] people that are have a revelation of who
[1:28:43] they are who god is who the word is
[1:28:48] and they've submitted their ideas to
[1:28:50] that voice
[1:28:57] that's why you look at the picture of
[1:28:58] the the the the cloud that appears over
[1:29:02] flagstaff what was that
[1:29:04] it was a headship
[1:29:07] it was a headship that came down to the
[1:29:09] body
[1:29:10] do you realize what that was it was
[1:29:12] christ in his dissension
[1:29:15] you see everybody look for brother
[1:29:17] branham on his last revival that his
[1:29:19] last pool would be some great other
[1:29:21] healing campaign or it'd be some
[1:29:22] sensation or it'd speak uh you know more
[1:29:25] squirrels into existence or he'd speak
[1:29:27] body change everyone looked for some
[1:29:29] sensation or emotional experience
[1:29:32] but the the next phase of the prophet's
[1:29:34] ministry was not an emotional experience
[1:29:36] or a healing revival but he said i was
[1:29:39] in sabino canyon and he says i stretched
[1:29:41] out my hand and a sword struck my hand
[1:29:45] and he says i looked up and he says this
[1:29:47] is not just a sword it's the sword
[1:29:50] it's the word of the lord the
[1:29:52] vindication of your ministry
[1:29:54] what was it it was christ vindicating
[1:29:57] himself with his prophet
[1:30:02] have we submitted ourself
[1:30:04] not to a man
[1:30:07] but have we submitted ourselves to
[1:30:09] christ
[1:30:10] it's one thing to say that we believe it
[1:30:12] it's another entirely different thing
[1:30:15] to submit yourself to it
[1:30:17] amen
[1:30:18] and say lord i check all my ideas
[1:30:21] and all of my opinions
[1:30:23] and all of my theories of what i think
[1:30:26] and i surrender
[1:30:28] to what your word has said through a
[1:30:30] vindicated prophet
[1:30:34] what was that it was
[1:30:36] we we'll get to it maybe just a little
[1:30:37] bit later don't want to get sidetracked
[1:30:38] he says god unfolded himself not in
[1:30:40] sensations no
[1:30:42] yet sensations yet
[1:30:44] is
[1:30:45] with it
[1:30:47] amen even the quote where brother
[1:30:48] branham says that the baptism of the
[1:30:50] holy ghost without sensation you read
[1:30:52] the rest of that quote and he says and
[1:30:54] the works of christ
[1:30:57] it's the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:30:59] without sensation yet the works and the
[1:31:01] works that he did of christ
[1:31:03] living through you the manifestation of
[1:31:05] christ oh my brother and my sister you
[1:31:08] may not speak in tongues you may not
[1:31:10] jump up and down you may not shout but
[1:31:12] the manifestation of christ better be
[1:31:14] manifesting and expressing himself
[1:31:17] through your life
[1:31:20] sensations yet is with it i love how
[1:31:22] brother branham says this you see the
[1:31:24] place i wish i wish people could see the
[1:31:27] place
[1:31:29] brother branham places this
[1:31:31] not in the left ditch
[1:31:33] not in the right ditch
[1:31:35] but right down the middle
[1:31:37] it gets so humble till anybody can see
[1:31:39] it if you don't try to put or inject
[1:31:42] your own mind to it see and your own
[1:31:46] thoughts it's god
[1:31:49] next slide
[1:31:51] now and then they become a bunch of
[1:31:52] fanatics then there's real cold formals
[1:31:56] on this side
[1:31:57] here's the fanatics
[1:31:59] on the other side
[1:32:00] here's the cold formals on this side
[1:32:02] it's the word and the word only and we
[1:32:04] just have the word and that which is
[1:32:06] perfect is come then that which is in
[1:32:07] part is done away with brother madam we
[1:32:09] don't need no more manifestation of the
[1:32:11] spirit we don't need no more gifts of
[1:32:12] the spirit we don't need to we don't
[1:32:14] need tongues anymore paul said i would
[1:32:17] that all of you spoke in tongues
[1:32:19] did you know that the gift of speaking
[1:32:21] in tongues is the only thing that you're
[1:32:23] allowed to covet in the bible
[1:32:27] go read your bible
[1:32:31] that's what it says
[1:32:32] it's the only thing god tells us to
[1:32:34] covet is the gift of speaking in tongues
[1:32:36] i told my brother just the uh last week
[1:32:38] i said you know i remember years later
[1:32:40] after i was born of the spirit of god
[1:32:41] and came back from a missions trip in my
[1:32:43] in in my mother-in-law's house actually
[1:32:46] in tucson and i remember coming back
[1:32:48] from that trip there and just was there
[1:32:50] home alone for three or four hours and
[1:32:52] just praying and just asking god not
[1:32:54] desiring to speak in tongues at all not
[1:32:56] desiring any kind of outward
[1:32:57] manifestation but just was on my knees
[1:32:59] and talking to god about something i'd
[1:33:02] been praying about all through the
[1:33:03] meetings and all through the week and i
[1:33:05] just said lord i just need an answer
[1:33:06] from you right now i'll never forget i
[1:33:09] grabbed that leather the back of that
[1:33:10] leather chair and it was it was like
[1:33:13] grabbing the horns of the altar for me
[1:33:15] and i grabbed i remember i probably
[1:33:17] damaged the chair when i did it but i
[1:33:19] just grabbed that leather so hard and
[1:33:21] for some reason i said lord this is you
[1:33:24] and i've got a hold of you and i'm not
[1:33:26] letting you go until you come and change
[1:33:28] me right now until you come and reveal
[1:33:30] yourself right now friends no more than
[1:33:32] i had spoke those words
[1:33:34] and all i can tell you is that a
[1:33:36] fountain
[1:33:37] from heaven
[1:33:38] almost like someone took a bucket of
[1:33:40] water and just dumped it and it went
[1:33:42] down in my head and it came out of my
[1:33:44] mouth
[1:33:48] and when i came to my
[1:35:13] you
[1:38:01] you
[1:38:52] he could do anything you didn't try to
[1:38:54] separate us brother and says here's the
[1:38:56] ride it
[1:39:02] god vindicated it as he goes along
[1:39:07] you say brother matt do we needly do do
[1:39:09] we need a pentecostal experience you
[1:39:11] ought to have one brother branham told
[1:39:13] that to the branham tabernacle in 1964 i
[1:39:16] would that you all had a pentecostal
[1:39:18] experience but you're too ashamed of it
[1:39:23] you say brother matt what does that mean
[1:39:24] means we draw from both
[1:39:26] sides
[1:39:28] amen he says he says that and here goes
[1:39:31] along he says god vindicated as he goes
[1:39:33] along go to the next line if you could
[1:39:35] here we come back if you could
[1:39:36] rationalism
[1:39:37] so it's amazing in reality
[1:39:41] our scope of knowledge is very limited
[1:39:44] no matter how much you knowledge you
[1:39:45] acquire by school or by college or by
[1:39:47] degree
[1:39:49] really your knowledge is just a drop in
[1:39:51] a bucket
[1:39:52] all of the knowledge you could ever
[1:39:54] acquire you may be a a a a a an expert
[1:39:59] an expert on one subject and have the
[1:40:02] expert knowledge and be you could even
[1:40:04] be called an expert witness
[1:40:06] to where you are you are you are you
[1:40:08] have a degree it's something you've
[1:40:10] studied but really
[1:40:11] if you take all of man's knowledge and
[1:40:14] everything he can acquire by learning
[1:40:16] it's just a drop
[1:40:17] in a bucket
[1:40:18] [Music]
[1:40:20] and if all we see
[1:40:22] is what we see
[1:40:24] we don't really see all there is to see
[1:40:30] if all you see is what you see
[1:40:34] yeah can i say it that way then we
[1:40:36] really don't see all there is to be seen
[1:40:39] amen since not everything that you see
[1:40:42] is all there is but there's an entire
[1:40:44] other dimension
[1:40:47] amen
[1:40:48] an invisible battle taking place
[1:40:51] an invisible war brother branham called
[1:40:53] it the greatest battle that was ever
[1:40:55] fought it's happening in the mind
[1:40:58] and you get truth listen to me i want to
[1:41:00] say this today i want the truth i want
[1:41:03] the whole truth and nothing but the
[1:41:05] truth
[1:41:06] and i don't just want knowledge i want
[1:41:08] the person of the truth
[1:41:10] i want him to sow and so fill me with
[1:41:13] his life
[1:41:14] to where i could say like jesus said i
[1:41:16] and my father are one hallelujah
[1:41:20] amen
[1:41:22] no sign listen to this gee pila asks
[1:41:24] this it's amazing because intellectual
[1:41:26] faith even pontus pilate it's incredible
[1:41:28] because for hundreds of years hundreds
[1:41:31] of years
[1:41:32] if you looked up brother google he would
[1:41:34] tell you pontius pilate never even
[1:41:36] existed if we had google back in the 20s
[1:41:38] and 30s and 40s
[1:41:40] you know there's no proof there's
[1:41:41] everyone wants a sign jesus said they
[1:41:43] seek a sign you know there was no proof
[1:41:45] that pontus pilate ever lived
[1:41:48] ever
[1:41:49] that he wasn't ever even a man
[1:41:52] now if you want to go with intellectual
[1:41:54] faith
[1:41:55] this is as far as it can take you
[1:41:59] well i didn't find any evidence of it i
[1:42:01] can't find any evidence
[1:42:04] and we do our research which for today
[1:42:05] that means www.google.com
[1:42:10] there's no evidence of pilate he never
[1:42:13] even lived
[1:42:14] and you know people's faith becomes so
[1:42:16] shaken by that
[1:42:18] they they they have no evidence you know
[1:42:19] what happened though in 1962 in an
[1:42:21] archaeologist's site they find a they
[1:42:23] find an inscription of pontus
[1:42:27] amen
[1:42:28] and then what happens to all those
[1:42:30] people whose faith was shaken because
[1:42:32] there was no physical proof of pontus
[1:42:35] pilate let me just tell you i didn't
[1:42:37] need an inscription to believe that
[1:42:38] pilate ever lived i didn't need an
[1:42:40] archaeologist to discover or to tell me
[1:42:42] to wear go oh now i can believe that
[1:42:44] pilate lived but there was a revelation
[1:42:46] of who he was there was a revelation of
[1:42:49] the person of christ and i don't need a
[1:42:50] physical proof i didn't need an
[1:42:52] archaeologist to discover it
[1:42:54] because my faith is not rested in an
[1:42:57] intellectual realm
[1:42:59] [Applause]
[1:43:00] amen hello
[1:43:03] it's a question that he asks what is
[1:43:06] truth you know this is actually
[1:43:07] something philosophers have asked for
[1:43:09] years you go and study a little bit of
[1:43:11] philosophy and i don't recommend that
[1:43:12] you do but if you do for centuries
[1:43:15] they've asked this question what is
[1:43:17] truth it's the same thing men are asking
[1:43:19] today what is real am i real is this
[1:43:22] real
[1:43:22] or do i just think uh or am i do i just
[1:43:25] think i'm here am i really here what is
[1:43:28] truth what is real truth what is the
[1:43:30] meaning of life
[1:43:32] what is the real true purpose of life
[1:43:36] you know that's the question we have to
[1:43:37] ask about everything and it's the
[1:43:40] question about religion today what's
[1:43:42] true and what's false one religion
[1:43:44] claims there's three gods
[1:43:46] one religion claims that there's only
[1:43:47] one god and there's another religion
[1:43:49] that claims there's 30 million gods
[1:43:52] go go study the hindu faith 30 million
[1:43:56] gods and we're fighting over three or
[1:43:58] one
[1:44:01] and then you have another entire
[1:44:02] philosophy that claims i actually
[1:44:04] there's not one there's not three
[1:44:05] there's not a million there's not 30
[1:44:06] million there's no god
[1:44:09] there's none
[1:44:11] there's no god whatsoever no gods at all
[1:44:13] so let me say this the real question is
[1:44:16] not what we believe
[1:44:18] but is what we believe
[1:44:20] true and it doesn't matter what you
[1:44:22] believe and let me say it it matters
[1:44:24] what you believe is pilate asked the
[1:44:26] question and pilate had the same
[1:44:28] skepticism that many have today what is
[1:44:31] truth how do you know
[1:44:33] how do we find out how can you know the
[1:44:36] answer to pilate's question was standing
[1:44:40] ten feet from him amen
[1:44:44] and he's longing to know what is truth
[1:44:46] and it's right in front of him
[1:44:50] amen
[1:44:52] in plain sight
[1:44:54] you're searching for something that's
[1:44:55] just right there
[1:44:57] people in this world are
[1:44:59] searching for truth and it's just right
[1:45:01] there
[1:45:02] amen
[1:45:05] the answer to this question was standing
[1:45:06] 10 feet and you know what jesus says
[1:45:09] jesus says pilate
[1:45:11] i am the truth
[1:45:13] yeah now that's a that's a powerful
[1:45:15] claim
[1:45:17] but there's a reason why that claim was
[1:45:20] so
[1:45:21] contrary when he says i am the truth it
[1:45:24] was so contrarian so contradictory that
[1:45:28] it got him crucified
[1:45:30] now let's begs the question today if
[1:45:33] what jesus preached got him crucified if
[1:45:36] what paul preached god has got god got
[1:45:39] him killed got his head cut off if what
[1:45:41] all the disciples preached got them
[1:45:43] persecuted and killed then what are we
[1:45:45] preaching
[1:45:50] if what they preached was hated and
[1:45:52] despised by the world then we got to be
[1:45:54] careful to make sure what we're
[1:45:55] preaching if everybody in the masses
[1:45:57] accept it and the churches fill up and
[1:46:00] mega churches with thousands of members
[1:46:03] i got a question what are you preaching
[1:46:07] you say well this church isn't a man you
[1:46:09] see a mega church my goodness they just
[1:46:10] have thousands and thousands and
[1:46:12] thousands of people well what are they
[1:46:14] preaching
[1:46:17] well message churches there's only 50
[1:46:19] here and maybe average on 100 people an
[1:46:21] average would be more probably more like
[1:46:22] 25 people in an average message church
[1:46:25] you got a hundred people in your church
[1:46:27] you've got a pretty good-sized church
[1:46:28] man you've got 500 you're a mega message
[1:46:31] church
[1:46:32] [Applause]
[1:46:34] but his brother jd says that's not a
[1:46:36] mega church you got that you got me you
[1:46:38] got me churches in dallas joel osteen's
[1:46:40] church has over somebody correct me over
[1:46:42] 20 000 people on a sunday
[1:46:45] but what are they preaching
[1:46:48] amen if what jesus preached got him
[1:46:50] crucified and that was the truth why did
[1:46:52] paul say i am not ashamed
[1:46:56] of the gospel of jesus christ amen for i
[1:46:59] believe it's the power of salvation why
[1:47:01] was paul using words like this because
[1:47:03] it was something that was rejected and
[1:47:05] not acceptable
[1:47:07] to culture people say well jesus you
[1:47:10] know that the the the jesus was jesus
[1:47:12] was a good man
[1:47:14] you know jesus was a jesus was a he was
[1:47:16] a prophet i believe he was a prophet
[1:47:18] he's a good man he taught good morals he
[1:47:20] taught good things you got to love your
[1:47:21] neighbor and
[1:47:22] you know love your neighbor like
[1:47:24] yourself and you you know you know hey
[1:47:26] jesus preached all these morals and all
[1:47:27] these great concepts and people can oh
[1:47:29] man they'll just eat that all up oh yeah
[1:47:32] oh god is love well i love too and it's
[1:47:34] just a love culture and jesus jesus
[1:47:36] loves me oh i love me too
[1:47:41] jesus loves you
[1:47:43] that's great jesus thinks you're awesome
[1:47:46] i think i'm awesome too
[1:47:49] and people just swallow that hook line
[1:47:51] and sinker and they take it in and the
[1:47:53] entire church is built and you have
[1:47:55] thousands of people believing it yeah
[1:47:58] that's right
[1:47:59] amen one of the one of one of these isms
[1:48:01] is rationalism as we have it there if
[1:48:04] you ask the apostles or anyone in the
[1:48:06] book of acts
[1:48:07] church
[1:48:08] they would have a simple answer for you
[1:48:10] if you would ask them what is truth they
[1:48:12] would have one simple answer truth is
[1:48:14] the person of the word revealed
[1:48:17] no one questioned god no one questioned
[1:48:20] uh who god's word it was during the
[1:48:22] reformation that people rose up and said
[1:48:25] truth isn't what the church says or
[1:48:27] decrees
[1:48:28] but truth is god's word
[1:48:32] because you had an entire church of
[1:48:34] people declaring this is what church is
[1:48:37] and it's penances and it's it's uh it's
[1:48:40] indulgences you know that's why martin
[1:48:41] luther protested
[1:48:44] because luther said it's not what you
[1:48:45] say it is it's what it says it is
[1:48:49] it's what the word
[1:48:50] says that it is
[1:48:52] and so now you have a few hundred years
[1:48:54] later
[1:48:55] and there was a great shift in our world
[1:48:59] and you may not have realized that but a
[1:49:00] great shift
[1:49:02] they call it the enlightenment
[1:49:05] the enlightenment happened it was really
[1:49:07] an endarkenment more than it was an
[1:49:09] enlightenment
[1:49:10] and i mean that that sounds funny but i
[1:49:12] mean that it was more where man exalts
[1:49:15] man's knowledge thankful for great
[1:49:17] things that happen out of the
[1:49:18] enlightenment that we benefit from today
[1:49:21] but really that enlightenment was a
[1:49:23] further as brother branham says the more
[1:49:24] education more so civilization moves you
[1:49:27] further away from the kingdom of god can
[1:49:30] you say amen
[1:49:31] so the shift was this truth is no longer
[1:49:34] what god tells us but it's what we find
[1:49:38] out for ourselves
[1:49:40] to put it simply human reasoning
[1:49:42] replaced
[1:49:44] divine revelation
[1:49:47] you no longer accepted what the word
[1:49:49] taught
[1:49:50] you thought it through for yourself you
[1:49:53] used your own
[1:49:54] critical thinking
[1:49:57] amen
[1:49:59] got to use critical thinking i love that
[1:50:01] buzzword people like to use
[1:50:04] you got to use critical thinking or
[1:50:06] common sense
[1:50:08] truth was what
[1:50:10] i think
[1:50:12] that's the heart of this rationalism
[1:50:15] that affects our culture and permeates
[1:50:17] our schools and permeates our
[1:50:18] educational systems
[1:50:20] it makes man his own god whether he
[1:50:24] wants to admit that or not
[1:50:26] it makes man his own god because he
[1:50:28] could discover he could discover truth
[1:50:30] you want to know what truth is you can
[1:50:32] discover it you can learn it uh you can
[1:50:35] you you can rationalize it you don't
[1:50:38] need god to help you you don't need god
[1:50:40] to reveal it to you man can discover it
[1:50:43] with the use of critical thinking and
[1:50:45] common sense in his mind through his own
[1:50:47] senses god gave you a brain you better
[1:50:49] use your brain we can use our brain and
[1:50:52] we can learn by the brain god gave us we
[1:50:54] could find
[1:50:55] truth
[1:50:56] well they did that and there's how many
[1:50:59] denominations
[1:51:02] how many schools of theology how many
[1:51:04] think this way and think differently
[1:51:06] about this way that not one agrees with
[1:51:08] the next
[1:51:09] but we all have brains
[1:51:12] at least some of us do
[1:51:18] oh man can discover it
[1:51:21] with his own senses
[1:51:23] with his own mind
[1:51:25] which of course opens the entire world
[1:51:27] and the entire field for science
[1:51:30] discovery
[1:51:31] science is what you can observe to be
[1:51:33] true
[1:51:34] let me say this most of the scientists
[1:51:36] early scientists believed in god right
[1:51:38] amen
[1:51:39] you go study that for yourself galileo
[1:51:41] believed in god that's right isaac
[1:51:43] newton was a believer
[1:51:46] the first scientist believed in god
[1:51:48] bacon uh
[1:51:50] copernicus they were men who believed in
[1:51:52] god real scientists
[1:51:54] believe in god
[1:51:56] and that led them to what is called
[1:51:58] deism i think i have that giddy and you
[1:52:00] could put that up deism i'm just going
[1:52:02] to give you the exact and this could get
[1:52:04] wordy so just listen close but the deism
[1:52:06] is belief
[1:52:08] in the existence of a supreme being
[1:52:11] specifically of a creator
[1:52:14] it's the belief in a divine being
[1:52:17] a divine creator who does not intervene
[1:52:20] or have any
[1:52:22] interactions
[1:52:23] with the universe
[1:52:26] this term is used chiefly of an
[1:52:28] intellectual movement of the 17th and
[1:52:30] 18th century that accepted the existence
[1:52:33] of a creator on the basis of reason but
[1:52:36] rejected belief in a supernatural deity
[1:52:39] who interacts
[1:52:41] with humankind
[1:52:42] deism they believe in god but they don't
[1:52:45] believe that god is closely interwoven
[1:52:47] and he gets involved in the affairs of
[1:52:49] the world well i'm here to tell you
[1:52:51] god's in control of every button
[1:52:53] and every lever and every lever god's in
[1:52:56] control of it all amen
[1:52:58] oh you better watch what putin listen
[1:53:00] putin can't do anything brother man said
[1:53:02] i'll take a crazy madman but i'm going
[1:53:03] to tell you what it'll take god
[1:53:05] at his designed and appointed time it'll
[1:53:08] be god who pushes the button really it
[1:53:11] won't be man
[1:53:13] and so they believe this they reject a
[1:53:15] belief in any supernatural deity
[1:53:17] interacts with humankind it means god
[1:53:19] created the world
[1:53:21] we believe that but he no longer is in
[1:53:23] control of his creation
[1:53:25] the world is like a watch sort of like a
[1:53:28] watch you know that you wind up and and
[1:53:30] and you just well god just took this
[1:53:32] watch and he just wound it up and wound
[1:53:34] it up and now it must go its own way it
[1:53:36] can't be altered uh it operates
[1:53:38] according to its own laws and and we
[1:53:41] still believe in god
[1:53:43] we still believe in god we still believe
[1:53:45] in a creator you know but many of these
[1:53:47] scientists believe that god himself
[1:53:49] could not change the order of nature so
[1:53:51] they gave their minds to discover the
[1:53:53] laws of nature and you know what
[1:53:55] happened it was good to discover the
[1:53:56] laws of nature but they become so
[1:53:58] exalted in pride in their own human
[1:54:01] intellect that they give no credit to
[1:54:04] god
[1:54:06] and by reasoning we became the people in
[1:54:09] charge of our universe
[1:54:12] in other words the authority of human
[1:54:14] reasoning took over
[1:54:16] from the authority
[1:54:18] of the divine revealer amen
[1:54:21] and this introduced the next age of
[1:54:23] skepticism it's prophesied in the bible
[1:54:26] in the book of jude if you read jude go
[1:54:28] to the next one if you could get in
[1:54:30] people no longer believe a thing just
[1:54:33] because they're told they want to find
[1:54:34] it out for themselves whether it's true
[1:54:36] or not whether it appeals to their logic
[1:54:41] whether they can understand it
[1:54:43] but it's tragic it's very tragic when a
[1:54:46] man will only believe what he
[1:54:47] understands
[1:54:50] i said that right
[1:54:52] it's tragic when people can only believe
[1:54:56] what they can understand
[1:54:58] you see there's so much that we don't
[1:55:00] understand
[1:55:02] yet we still believe
[1:55:04] i believed in pilate long before i got a
[1:55:07] record of pilate's inscription of a
[1:55:08] signature
[1:55:10] because i my belief is a revelation
[1:55:12] that's revealed
[1:55:14] and i believe outside of what i can
[1:55:16] discover or i understand i may never say
[1:55:19] brother than that you mean you preachers
[1:55:20] don't have all the answers uh-oh
[1:55:25] uh oh
[1:55:27] cat's out of the bag
[1:55:30] hallelujah right brother jd you got all
[1:55:32] the answers no
[1:55:34] no remember brother jason doesn't have
[1:55:36] all the answers
[1:55:38] we don't understand everything perfectly
[1:55:40] and clearly
[1:55:41] no
[1:55:43] but i know one who does
[1:55:45] and i put my trust in that man who does
[1:55:49] the age of skepticism as prophesied in
[1:55:51] the book of jude people no longer
[1:55:53] believe it just because what they're
[1:55:54] told uh the the man becomes listen
[1:55:57] you'll never fully understand god you
[1:55:59] can never
[1:56:01] discover god in his entirety
[1:56:06] in fact what happens
[1:56:08] is the result of rationalism is that we
[1:56:10] become
[1:56:12] uh we be we we exalt a creation but we
[1:56:14] forget our creator
[1:56:16] because science can tell you nothing
[1:56:18] about the creator it can only tell you
[1:56:20] about the creation
[1:56:23] which has changed our vision of from
[1:56:25] heaven to earth it's taken man's mind
[1:56:28] his brother aaron preached on the the in
[1:56:31] ecclesiastes the condition of the fallen
[1:56:33] man it takes his mind from looking up to
[1:56:36] a god and trusting a god and now he
[1:56:38] trusts in his own eyes and what he can
[1:56:40] figure out and understand
[1:56:42] and discover are you here still this
[1:56:44] morning
[1:56:45] amen
[1:56:46] and so he looks at it this way because
[1:56:49] it changes your earthly your heavenly
[1:56:51] vision to an earthly vision it brought
[1:56:53] man down to the material world
[1:56:56] in which we live and i'm thankful for
[1:56:58] that we can't be so heavily minded that
[1:57:00] we're of no earthly good
[1:57:02] but you should be as believers heavenly
[1:57:04] minded and look at everything through a
[1:57:06] heavenly vision
[1:57:08] so we preached wednesday night you don't
[1:57:09] look at your circumstances you look at
[1:57:11] the word amen
[1:57:13] amen
[1:57:14] and so what happens is the great shift
[1:57:17] was a shift from divine revelation of
[1:57:19] god revealing himself to human reasoning
[1:57:22] i can't understand it so it must not be
[1:57:24] true
[1:57:25] or you've got to explain it to me before
[1:57:27] i believe it's true
[1:57:28] the reaction of this rationalism was
[1:57:31] what was called a movement of
[1:57:32] romanticism go to the next slide
[1:57:35] also called the romantic era
[1:57:38] romanticism was
[1:57:40] an artistic literary
[1:57:43] musical
[1:57:45] intellectual movement
[1:57:47] that originates in europe towards the
[1:57:49] end of the 18th century and in most
[1:57:52] areas was at its peak in the in the
[1:57:53] period from 1800 to 1850
[1:57:56] some of the main characteristics of the
[1:57:59] romantic era the romantic literature
[1:58:01] includes a focus on the writer or
[1:58:04] narrators emotions
[1:58:07] and inner world it's a celebration of
[1:58:10] nature and beauty and imagination
[1:58:14] and it we're it's a rejection of of of
[1:58:17] of rationalism
[1:58:20] it's not just it's not what we learn or
[1:58:21] what we can understand or deduct by
[1:58:24] reasoning but oh
[1:58:26] you got to feel the music
[1:58:30] you got to feel it it's something you
[1:58:32] experience in your emotional realm a
[1:58:36] human it says humans are not just
[1:58:38] thinking creatures but they're filling
[1:58:40] creatures
[1:58:41] and reality needs to be felt
[1:58:45] what is true
[1:58:46] actually as you see this shift from
[1:58:48] skepticism rationalism everything that's
[1:58:51] true is what i can find out what i can
[1:58:52] discover and allah says no actually what
[1:58:55] is true is what i can feel
[1:58:58] why do you feel that why why do you
[1:59:00] think that i don't know i just feel like
[1:59:01] i just feel like it
[1:59:04] i don't know just something i feel you
[1:59:06] know it's just a feeling that i have
[1:59:09] and so there there came not just a
[1:59:11] desire for a scientific explanation
[1:59:13] we're not going to be much longer
[1:59:15] things but a desire not just for a
[1:59:18] scientific explanation
[1:59:20] but an experience of those things that
[1:59:23] we understand people want to feel
[1:59:25] something they don't feel it's real
[1:59:27] unless they felt it
[1:59:29] it's even the some people that's their
[1:59:31] true test of worship it wasn't really
[1:59:33] worship unless i felt it
[1:59:36] no listen friends real worship is when
[1:59:38] you can worship when you don't feel it
[1:59:39] at all
[1:59:41] real entering into worship is when you
[1:59:43] say i really had a rough week i had a
[1:59:45] tired week i got a headache i don't feel
[1:59:48] like going to church and i think i've
[1:59:50] got sniffles a good excuse for me to
[1:59:51] stay at home but yet you get in your car
[1:59:53] you dress yourself you go to church with
[1:59:55] a headache with a migraine and yet
[1:59:58] somehow you still raise your hands and
[1:59:59] say lord even though i don't feel like
[2:00:01] it you're still worthy of all of my
[2:00:03] praise i'm still going to give you
[2:00:05] adoration because you're worthy of it
[2:00:07] god
[2:00:08] that's true worship
[2:00:12] and so people want to feel it they don't
[2:00:14] feel it's real unless it's real it's
[2:00:16] romanticism you had the cold clinical
[2:00:20] very cold
[2:00:21] rationalism that everything's got to be
[2:00:23] rationalized which led to the field of
[2:00:25] science and then we had romanticism
[2:00:27] which led to the field of arts and
[2:00:29] paintings and music and and and it's it
[2:00:33] was a way to to help us better
[2:00:35] understand what we what is truth people
[2:00:37] look to the world around us and wanted
[2:00:40] to fill it we need to feel music music
[2:00:42] touches listen it's true music touches
[2:00:45] you at a very emotional level
[2:00:47] that's why when words can't change an
[2:00:49] atmosphere put a little music on and it
[2:00:51] changes the entire feeling
[2:00:54] remember it's drawing from both sides
[2:00:57] you do feel it music changes saul
[2:00:59] understood this and brought david in
[2:01:01] when he was troubled by an evil spirit
[2:01:02] to play music for him
[2:01:05] you say oh yeah brother matt that's true
[2:01:07] i do feel it well that's why it's
[2:01:08] important
[2:01:10] what music you listen to
[2:01:14] because music has a way to change
[2:01:15] someone that words never can
[2:01:19] and all the human intellect i can drill
[2:01:21] inside of you will never change you but
[2:01:23] you put the right music on and the right
[2:01:24] feeling and you got the right mood
[2:01:29] i could tell a funny story but i'll save
[2:01:31] time
[2:01:36] you got to feel it and it's important
[2:01:38] absolutely isn't is important music
[2:01:40] touches us
[2:01:42] at a level that intellectual
[2:01:45] can't if you can understand that's what
[2:01:47] they say you know modern art you take
[2:01:50] this picture and it's just like looks
[2:01:51] like a blob
[2:01:53] and it's just like someone took paint
[2:01:55] just and just flung it on there like i
[2:01:57] did you know as you see kids take mud
[2:01:58] and they just
[2:02:01] and then they got these paintings they
[2:02:03] sell for five thousand eight thousand
[2:02:05] dollars
[2:02:07] if you can't understand
[2:02:10] you say i can't understand it then
[2:02:11] you've understood it
[2:02:17] but i don't get it then you get it
[2:02:20] i don't understand why that's perfect
[2:02:22] leave it right there don't try to
[2:02:23] understand it because now you get it
[2:02:26] you're understanding it now you mean
[2:02:27] when i don't understand the art and the
[2:02:30] splatter and now i've somehow you felt
[2:02:33] it
[2:02:41] because what it's saying is the world
[2:02:44] doesn't really make sense
[2:02:46] i look at it you know it's it's nonsense
[2:02:48] if if
[2:03:26] foreign
[2:06:01] you
[2:07:22] it's true for me
[2:07:28] for you but that's just how you know
[2:07:30] that's that's how that's how i think you
[2:07:32] know i think of it that way it's just my
[2:07:34] opinion you know it may not be your
[2:07:35] opinion and that's okay if it's not your
[2:07:37] opinion you know what i could be right
[2:07:39] and you could be right we might both be
[2:07:41] right
[2:07:44] you might think differently live
[2:07:46] differently than me you know this is
[2:07:48] just my feeling
[2:07:50] just how i feel about it
[2:07:55] you know truth may be yours and then i
[2:07:57] have my truth and then everything just
[2:07:59] becomes relative
[2:08:00] you know this is what we have in our
[2:08:02] culture today everything's just relative
[2:08:03] and however you feel
[2:08:06] well let me just tell you right now
[2:08:07] that's not what we believe at this
[2:08:09] church
[2:08:10] that's not what we're ever going to
[2:08:11] preach at this church that's not what we
[2:08:13] stand for at this church we have an
[2:08:15] absolute that we're tied to
[2:08:17] and that absolute is a vindicated word
[2:08:19] that was vindicated thoroughly
[2:08:22] not to lift up a man but it was
[2:08:24] vindicated to lift up christ jesus the
[2:08:26] man and that word is our absolute and
[2:08:30] there is no relativeness about it and
[2:08:32] it's not my opinion or your opinion it's
[2:08:35] not what i think or what you think it's
[2:08:37] what jesus said
[2:08:39] and what he said i hold true and say
[2:08:41] lord i stand on it i may not understand
[2:08:43] it but i'm going to believe it with all
[2:08:45] of my heart and i'm going to submit and
[2:08:47] surrender myself to it
[2:08:52] truth is not a consensus of what
[2:08:54] everyone thinks
[2:08:57] and
[2:08:57] irrelevantistic or if i could say that
[2:08:59] word relativistic atmosphere there's no
[2:09:02] such there's no divisions it's true or
[2:09:04] false or right or wrong and all is
[2:09:05] relative nothing's black and white
[2:09:07] nothing everything is gray so you could
[2:09:09] never say that's wrong
[2:09:12] you know in islam there's 99 names for
[2:09:15] god father is not one of them
[2:09:18] because islam doesn't believe that as
[2:09:20] the quran says god has no son has had no
[2:09:23] son and has no sons yet we believe that
[2:09:26] god is a father
[2:09:28] because he had a son and we're his sons
[2:09:32] in an absolute age one of those is true
[2:09:35] and one of those is false but in a
[2:09:38] relative relative age both are true
[2:09:40] they're just both different aspects of
[2:09:42] truth but the real question is what's
[2:09:44] true
[2:09:45] what's truth a relativist says
[2:09:47] everything and everyone is right
[2:09:50] you know the bible has been questioned
[2:09:52] now as a source of absolute truth it's
[2:09:54] not regarded as a record of relative
[2:09:56] truth they believe i've even heard a man
[2:09:58] say philosophers well the bible is
[2:09:59] culturally conditioned
[2:10:02] the bible's culturally conditioned you
[2:10:04] know it
[2:10:05] you know what does that mean it means
[2:10:06] it's a reliable record of of how those
[2:10:10] in bible times
[2:10:12] view truth
[2:10:14] but it may not may or may not apply to
[2:10:17] our culture those things and you know
[2:10:18] what so people do they read the bible
[2:10:20] and they have a pair of scissors in this
[2:10:22] hand right and they go aha oh yeah oh i
[2:10:25] love your neighbor as yourself yeah i
[2:10:27] believe
[2:10:28] oh okay i
[2:10:30] oh no i i don't i don't know about that
[2:10:32] part clip clip clip clip clip
[2:10:36] now i don't know
[2:10:38] read the bible with a pair of scissors
[2:10:40] that's how people read the message too
[2:10:43] come on people
[2:10:45] how people read god's prophet too with a
[2:10:47] pair of scissors well you know that was
[2:10:49] just his opinion
[2:10:50] you know i don't really take that over
[2:10:52] here i don't really you know but i know
[2:10:53] his brother brandon but he was a man and
[2:10:55] you know i just i don't you know that's
[2:10:56] just not for me and i i don't know i'm
[2:10:58] just going to sort of put that on the
[2:11:00] shelf and you know people don't have a
[2:11:02] true revelation of what the bible is
[2:11:04] and so they cut it to pieces and people
[2:11:06] don't have a true revelation what the
[2:11:07] message is and so they cut it to pieces
[2:11:10] they don't realize they're cutting away
[2:11:12] not a man's idea
[2:11:14] so we said when you rejected jeremiah
[2:11:16] you weren't rejecting jeremiah
[2:11:18] you were rejecting jehovah jeremiah was
[2:11:21] just the messenger but it was jehovah's
[2:11:23] message
[2:11:24] amen
[2:11:26] everything is just relative you know
[2:11:28] jesus was a man of his time but he's not
[2:11:31] a man of our time
[2:11:35] then there's no right or wrong it's just
[2:11:38] sort of what you feel and what you
[2:11:40] understand there's no clear guidelines
[2:11:46] jesus says everyone that is of the truth
[2:11:50] that truth is something listen that
[2:11:52] truth is not something
[2:11:54] but it's someone amen
[2:11:57] the right question should have been who
[2:11:59] is truth because what pilate was
[2:12:01] searching for was standing right in
[2:12:02] front of him so truth doesn't come by
[2:12:05] scholarship it doesn't come by superior
[2:12:07] human intelligence or research because
[2:12:10] truth is
[2:12:11] a person
[2:12:13] and unless you know that person you
[2:12:15] don't you may know all about him but he
[2:12:17] said it's not to know his word but it's
[2:12:20] to know him as life
[2:12:22] you may know all about him but truth is
[2:12:24] a person no man jesus says can come to
[2:12:27] me unless the father draws him so
[2:12:29] without the inspiration of the holy
[2:12:31] spirit leading an individual to perceive
[2:12:34] spiritual things they never can
[2:12:38] many brilliant you take brilliant minds
[2:12:40] in the man age philosophers and
[2:12:41] brilliant men
[2:12:43] uh even even theologians today uh you
[2:12:46] know even even men who study the word of
[2:12:49] god yet study it their entire life
[2:12:53] rationalize it reason it understand the
[2:12:56] greek understand the hebrew can speak
[2:12:58] multiple languages
[2:13:00] yet never have met the author of the
[2:13:03] book that they're studying
[2:13:05] can you imagine
[2:13:08] understand it study it teach it have a
[2:13:10] degree in it but never
[2:13:12] meet
[2:13:13] the person
[2:13:16] because the truth
[2:13:18] can only be revealed
[2:13:21] it comes by divine
[2:13:23] revelation we're going to close
[2:13:26] un united under one head 1958 go to the
[2:13:29] next slide she said it's good to look at
[2:13:31] see the same that same devil if he can
[2:13:33] just get you to stop for a minute he can
[2:13:36] make you reason it out
[2:13:38] he can make you think with your mind but
[2:13:40] god doesn't use a man's head god uses
[2:13:43] his heart
[2:13:45] god works on his heart while the devil
[2:13:47] works on his head god chose the heart
[2:13:50] the bible says as a man thank us in his
[2:13:52] heart so is he
[2:13:54] he says intellectual conception is all
[2:13:57] right but remember
[2:13:58] when the eyes when the eye looks upon it
[2:14:01] the devil uses
[2:14:03] your eye
[2:14:05] yeah
[2:14:06] this is what brother adam says the devil
[2:14:08] uses your eye in the garden of eden he
[2:14:10] proved that the devil chose the head of
[2:14:12] man to work in but god chose the heart
[2:14:15] the devil shows him with his eyes
[2:14:17] something that he can see
[2:14:18] and he says seeing as believing but when
[2:14:20] god comes to a man i love this he comes
[2:14:23] to his heart
[2:14:25] and he lets him believe things by his
[2:14:27] heart through faith that his eyes can't
[2:14:30] see
[2:14:31] for the scripture says that faith is the
[2:14:33] substance of things hoped for the
[2:14:36] evidence of things not seen
[2:14:39] god's working here satan working here
[2:14:42] god's working here satan's working here
[2:14:45] so what god does these big schools and
[2:14:47] seminaries what do they do anyhow not
[2:14:50] always but too many times it pulls from
[2:14:52] here
[2:14:53] up to here when it ought to be taken
[2:14:55] from here
[2:14:57] down to the man's heart and now shady in
[2:14:58] 1959 a few nights before we took the
[2:15:01] subject
[2:15:02] and the garden of eden last quote i'm
[2:15:03] going to read the devil chose the man's
[2:15:05] head by intellectual god chose his heart
[2:15:08] by faith and if you walk by faith you
[2:15:10] have to believe things that you can't
[2:15:12] see or even reason with your mind we
[2:15:15] cast down reasonings
[2:15:17] when god says anything we don't look at
[2:15:21] it no more
[2:15:24] intellectually
[2:15:26] we let it soak right down into our heart
[2:15:30] and call anything contrary to it as
[2:15:33] though it
[2:15:34] wasn't right
[2:15:36] we look at what god said who gave the
[2:15:38] promise
[2:15:39] that's where the world is tangled today
[2:15:43] it's a too much intellectual preaching
[2:15:45] instead of spirit-filled churches
[2:15:47] worshiping in the spirit they're
[2:15:49] listening to intellectual messages
[2:15:52] and you can you brother madam says and
[2:15:54] you can't
[2:15:55] reason this
[2:16:01] you can't reason this out it's something
[2:16:06] that's revealed
[2:16:09] i wish i had the quote here and christ
[2:16:10] is the mystery of god revealed brother
[2:16:12] and says true
[2:16:14] faith
[2:16:15] is a revelation from god
[2:16:18] and above anything that we can pray for
[2:16:21] i pray that god anoints you in your
[2:16:24] flesh i love an anointing on my flesh
[2:16:27] i pray that god anoints you in your
[2:16:29] spirit i love that my spirit can become
[2:16:32] anointed by the power of god but above
[2:16:34] all of those things i say lord anoint me
[2:16:37] in that innermost part of my being
[2:16:41] where you can reveal yourself to me that
[2:16:43] no emotion doesn't matter how i feel
[2:16:46] doesn't matter what i see doesn't matter
[2:16:48] what i can't see doesn't matter even
[2:16:51] what i understand or what i can't
[2:16:53] understand
[2:16:54] there's something that's been revealed
[2:16:56] down on the inside of my inside and no
[2:17:00] man jesus says can take that away amen
[2:17:04] nobody can take that away it's only
[2:17:07] revealed to the elected of god
[2:17:10] and i'm so glad i'm elected
[2:17:13] oh are you glad today friends
[2:17:15] say lord i'm so glad
[2:17:17] you chose me
[2:17:19] amen i want to say lord and i want to
[2:17:21] lift the hand up and say lord don't let
[2:17:23] me be in this left ditch over here don't
[2:17:25] let me be in this right ditch over here
[2:17:28] let me walk straight down the middle of
[2:17:30] the road let me draw from both sides but
[2:17:33] let me stay balanced
[2:17:35] let me stay give me a church that's
[2:17:36] balanced give me a life that's balanced
[2:17:38] oh god don't let me be over starchy
[2:17:40] where i can't feel the presence of god
[2:17:42] but don't let me be so fanatical and
[2:17:45] emotional that i don't love my brother
[2:17:47] or love my sister or i don't understand
[2:17:49] the word itself let me stay right in the
[2:17:51] middle of both lord
[2:17:53] and let me walk down through the highway
[2:17:54] of heaven let's stand to our feet if you
[2:17:57] could
[2:17:58] musicians could you come can you give
[2:18:00] the lord a handclap of praise he's
[2:18:01] worthy of it
[2:18:03] oh give him a real praise offering this
[2:18:05] morning
[2:18:06] hallelujah
[2:18:10] hallelujah
[2:18:13] that's what the same thing happened
[2:18:14] today
[2:18:18] because that our churches listen to this
[2:18:20] has became so intellectual that we got
[2:18:23] the best-dressed crowds the best
[2:18:25] organization the smartest ministers that
[2:18:28] we have no use of the holy spirit
[2:18:31] in the way that it was back there
[2:18:35] they're full in other words action
[2:18:36] speaks louder than words they're
[2:18:38] seminaries they're the brain of their
[2:18:39] being
[2:18:40] and they're coming together and
[2:18:42] discussing this and more able they're
[2:18:44] more able more intellectual minds to set
[2:18:46] a church in order better than what the
[2:18:48] holy spirit could do they don't need the
[2:18:50] holy spirit any longer that's what
[2:18:52] brother branham's saying here they don't
[2:18:53] need it any longer it's something that
[2:18:55] we don't need today oh that's a day of
[2:18:57] the past
[2:18:59] we don't need the holy spirit to heal
[2:19:00] the sick
[2:19:02] we got doctors
[2:19:03] i'm thankful for doctors
[2:19:06] we don't need the holy spirit to speak
[2:19:07] in tongues we're all intelligent people
[2:19:10] and when you do that
[2:19:13] you take right from the framework the
[2:19:15] lifeline
[2:19:17] you cut the lifeline of the church off
[2:19:21] you cut it off
[2:19:24] he says you do that you take the
[2:19:26] lifeline
[2:19:27] jesus said to them jews in his day
[2:19:28] haven't you read this the stone that was
[2:19:30] rejected is the chief cornerstone that
[2:19:33] all the building is set upon
[2:19:36] now you see what i mean i'm sure you can
[2:19:38] catch that
[2:19:39] the reason of it is because they thought
[2:19:41] they never had a need of it we don't
[2:19:43] need to speak with tongues we don't need
[2:19:44] interpreters of tongues we no longer
[2:19:46] need the old testament prophets to set
[2:19:48] us in order by the holy spirit we
[2:19:50] understand it
[2:19:52] see
[2:19:53] they've adopted a man-made system to
[2:19:55] take the place of the holy spirit
[2:19:57] therefore there is people that's elected
[2:20:00] listen i love this he says but there's a
[2:20:02] people who's elected
[2:20:04] whose name is on the lamb's book of life
[2:20:06] and they can't go for that i say lord i
[2:20:09] can't go for that
[2:20:11] how do you feel that way church
[2:20:13] i still am in need of the holy spirit
[2:20:15] i'm thankful for doctors but i still
[2:20:17] need a healer i'm thankful for teachers
[2:20:19] i'm thankful for for the bible i'm
[2:20:21] thankful for the word of god but i still
[2:20:22] need a divine revealer of the truth
[2:20:27] [Applause]
[2:20:28] he says they can't go for that they're
[2:20:30] spiritual minded they can't go they
[2:20:31] can't stand for it no matter if they're
[2:20:34] fathers and mothers whatever lived
[2:20:36] brother branham says oh i love this
[2:20:38] [Music]
[2:20:40] i want to just read these last few
[2:20:42] quotes when a church makes
[2:20:44] maybe it wouldn't speak that right out
[2:20:46] oh maybe they wouldn't say that right
[2:20:47] out right they won't speak it right out
[2:20:49] we don't believe in the gifts of the
[2:20:50] spirit anymore but their actions prove
[2:20:52] it
[2:20:53] here's the word and the holy spirit
[2:20:55] proves it amongst them when he can get
[2:20:57] them gathered together that he still
[2:20:59] heals the sick
[2:21:00] he still raises the dead he still speaks
[2:21:03] in tongues he still casts out devils
[2:21:06] so it depends on what's on the inside of
[2:21:09] a person if a man says he's born again
[2:21:12] and he tries to place these promises of
[2:21:15] christ in the last day to some other age
[2:21:18] making him christ yesterday but not
[2:21:20] today then that man of the person has
[2:21:22] became as under a delusion by satan and
[2:21:25] if that man says he believes that and it
[2:21:27] doesn't manifest itself through him
[2:21:30] jesus said in mark 16 these signs shall
[2:21:33] follow them that believe
[2:21:35] into all the world into every age
[2:21:38] casting out devils speaking with tongues
[2:21:41] and all these great manifestations of
[2:21:43] gifts that would follow that they shall
[2:21:45] not they they he says they may they
[2:21:47] ought to they will yes amen say brother
[2:21:51] matthew you're saying we we need the
[2:21:52] gifts of the spirit we need the gifts of
[2:21:54] the spirit if you didn't hear me clearly
[2:21:55] enough
[2:21:56] we need the gifts of the of the spirit
[2:21:59] say we we need them
[2:24:40] foreign

[2:25:43] myself

[2:27:37] oh
[2:27:39] [Music]
[2:27:47] [Music]
[2:27:54] read this quote last night forgot to
[2:27:56] even put it up listen to what brother
[2:27:57] adam says
[2:27:58] he says we've held this ground so long
[2:28:01] keep playing that and i believe or
[2:28:02] whatever you want to change to brother
[2:28:03] tony
[2:28:04] he says i believe
[2:28:07] with all my heart
[2:28:09] that we're on the threshold of stepping
[2:28:11] into another veil yonder you believe
[2:28:13] that
[2:28:14] right on the threshold
[2:28:16] somewhere to where the greater listen
[2:28:18] he says and for me
[2:28:20] i've got both of my ears and my heart
[2:28:22] open
[2:28:23] for when it comes he says remember
[2:28:26] satan will put out a mini a false runner
[2:28:28] but just lay it aside
[2:28:30] remember it's only signifying that
[2:28:33] something real is going to take place
[2:28:36] when you see it
[2:28:37] for satan will do everything to blockade
[2:28:41] the real jewel of god
[2:28:43] when it's coming forth
[2:28:46] you'll hear it he put out a blockade to
[2:28:48] catch abel put one to catch joseph one
[2:28:51] to catch jesus
[2:28:53] he did one to catch moses
[2:28:55] for you can notice those things that
[2:28:56] satan will always try to block it that's
[2:28:59] what i believe that many cults and
[2:29:01] things that we see rising over the
[2:29:02] nation it's only a light post
[2:29:05] to say look out
[2:29:07] it'll be here real soon
[2:29:09] i've noticed among our brethren many of
[2:29:11] you is coming into you as the full
[2:29:13] gospel coming from the baptist church
[2:29:15] myself accepting the doctrine of the
[2:29:17] baptism of the holy spirit being a
[2:29:20] separate work of the holy spirit and i
[2:29:22] thought then listen brother and says i
[2:29:24] accepted that that there's a work of
[2:29:26] grace that god does in our life when he
[2:29:28] not just justifies us not just
[2:29:30] sanctifies us but he fills us with the
[2:29:32] holy ghost brother brandon says i've
[2:29:33] accepted that
[2:29:35] and i thought
[2:29:37] martin luther when martin luther reached
[2:29:39] justification by faith he thought that
[2:29:42] settled it
[2:29:43] that was the light for his day
[2:29:45] and he preached it and then he entered
[2:29:47] another veil
[2:29:49] a man john wesley when calvinism began
[2:29:52] to sweep the nation and they'd settle
[2:29:54] down to saying what god's going to do
[2:29:56] he'll do it and it does it's no good to
[2:29:59] have a revival
[2:30:01] god raised up john wesley and he smashed
[2:30:04] calvinism to the ground
[2:30:05] to the place where ought to have its
[2:30:07] right balance
[2:30:09] under the works of sanctification the
[2:30:11] second work of grace nazarenes carried
[2:30:14] it on and along came the pentecostals
[2:30:17] the next the baptism of the holy spirit
[2:30:19] moving on up
[2:30:21] notice what brother ben is saying here
[2:30:23] there was a
[2:30:24] the holy spirit moving on up now listen
[2:30:27] keith on this part here
[2:30:29] and now when the brethren that's
[2:30:30] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:30:32] they said this is it this is the summit
[2:30:37] this this is all of it this is the
[2:30:39] summit we've reached it we've arrived
[2:30:41] this is the sum of it this is all of it
[2:30:44] brethren that's wrong
[2:30:46] there's no summit to god's power
[2:30:51] we move on and on and on it's the
[2:30:54] unlimited resources of god has never
[2:30:58] been tapped yet blessings and powers
[2:31:00] that we know nothing about
[2:31:03] it's never been revealed to archangels
[2:31:05] laying just ahead what's been laying
[2:31:06] just ahead of his for his church if
[2:31:08] they'll believe it for i hath not seen
[2:31:11] ear has not heard neither has it entered
[2:31:14] into the hearts of man what god has for
[2:31:16] them in store that love him friends
[2:31:19] that's not just in heaven don't place
[2:31:22] that just to the other side
[2:31:24] i have not seen and near hath not heard
[2:31:26] what god has in store for you
[2:31:29] tomorrow
[2:31:31] and next month
[2:31:32] and next month and if the lord tarries
[2:31:35] next year say brother matt what will be
[2:31:36] for me for next year more of god more of
[2:31:39] a spirit more of his love how many want
[2:31:42] that more of his power more of himself
[2:31:44] that's what's waiting for me is more
[2:31:47] don't ever put a cap on it don't ever
[2:31:49] say i've arrived i'm at the summit
[2:31:52] he says oh so i love this he says so
[2:31:55] let's move up and claim our rights i say
[2:31:59] god i want to claim my rights as a son
[2:32:01] of god how many mothers and fathers can
[2:32:03] do that today and say lord i claim my
[2:32:06] rights as a father for my children on
[2:32:08] behalf of my home i claim my rights as
[2:32:10] the son of god on behalf of my body
[2:32:13] satan you're a trespasser if you're in
[2:32:15] my body today you're a liar you're a
[2:32:17] squatter and i'm claiming my rights as a
[2:32:20] son of god
[2:32:22] brother branham says as as god opens the
[2:32:25] gates and swings out the welcome mat
[2:32:28] let's move on up into deeper depths
[2:32:32] and never colonize ourself and organize
[2:32:35] and get to a place where we say we
[2:32:37] believe this and that's all
[2:32:38] let's believe this plus plus
[2:32:41] how much more we can hear from god
[2:32:44] listen you can't hear more we've
[2:32:45] received the capstone message you're not
[2:32:47] going to get anything greater than what
[2:32:48] we've received already what you've
[2:32:50] received is enough to change your bodies
[2:32:53] from this human element to a
[2:32:55] supernatural element but that doesn't
[2:32:58] mean that i can't take more of what
[2:32:59] god's already given me and say lord
[2:33:01] increase my faith increase my hope
[2:33:04] increase my love and cr increase my
[2:33:07] revelation
[2:33:09] [Music]
[2:33:11] i think that ought to be the motive of
[2:33:13] every man and woman that loves the lord
[2:33:15] is to receive all that you can
[2:33:18] from the hand of his bountiful mercies
[2:33:22] i say lord i want to receive all that i
[2:33:24] can
[2:33:27] it's never enough
[2:33:29] you got to keep
[2:33:31] that's why brother adam says there's one
[2:33:33] filling oh but there's many refillings
[2:33:36] and refillings and refillings how many
[2:33:39] maybe someone here today would say lord
[2:33:40] i'm just in need of that refilling right
[2:33:43] now

[2:33:46] right now i want to receive you all
