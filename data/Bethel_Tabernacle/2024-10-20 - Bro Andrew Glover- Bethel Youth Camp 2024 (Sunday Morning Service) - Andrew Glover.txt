weekend coming from different areas of the country Lord Lord different walks of life different paths that we walk but Lord we've gathered here this weekend drawn from the East the West the north the South Lord but we've been drawn here by one thing and that's not a man that's not a personality but that's a message that you've sent in this generation and Lord that message is the focus of our life

pray and all the Believers says amen and amen if you have your Bibles this morning we want to go to the book of St Luke the 9th chapter the book of St Luke the ninth CH or the 19th Chapter rather St Luke chapter 19 we're going to read there and then we want to look in the book of 1 Peter chapter 2 amen you love the Lord this morning amen how many can Testify the Lord done something for you in that prayer line last night amen God bless you amen the labors are not in vain Brothers amen there's many hearts and lives touched amen St Luke chapter 19 and verse 41 the Bible here says and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it saying if thou had us known even thou at least in that in this thy day that the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are HID from thine eyes so there were things that could have been revealed and seen that would have brought peace but they were hid now from their eyes look at verse 43 for the day shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and Compass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another that's a that's a pretty dark situation isn't it you you know why that was happening because they knewest not the time of thy visitation the Bible tells us in Revelation three that the age we're living in would be wretched miserable poor blind and naked and the Bible says and knoweth it not see but if thou had known the day of thy visitation in the book of uh first Peter the book of First Peter I want to look there in 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse number 12 12 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse number 12 Peter here writing says having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may be that they might they may by your good works which they shall behold now watch this glorify God in the day of visitation glorify God in the day of visitation we ask Lord that just morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here uh this morning I want you by the help of the Lord uh to read you a quote here and maybe just to draw our title and our thought out of this scripture uh or this the passages we've read this morning but from the sermon 1962 the uncertain sound brother BM says heavenly father he says I pray the prayer for them with all my heart he says I give them to you they're trophies of the message he says they're trophies of your visitation so I want to talk to you for just a few moments on the trophies amen of visitation they're trophies of your visitation being here tonight amen seeing you walk among us doing works that has never been done since the foundation of the world until these days he said here they are they are your children he says I commend them to you Lord you give them to us and we give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ watch over them and raise them up at the last day I may never be able to shake their hands on this Earth but when the battle is over and the last trumpet has sounded amen watch and the dead has raising from the grave the lives have been called up together with them to meet the Lord in the air then may I have fellowship with Jesus Christ and them around the throne and through the Eternal ages to come granted Lord they are yours in the name of Jesus Christ amen I say my what a prayer that a prophet prayed amen that there were going to be people who were going to be trophies of the message of the hour now when you look at that word visitation Webster says that it is a special amen dispensation of divine favor amen or wrath so when a visitation comes it will either bring favor amen or it will bring wrath now the Bible speaks of a visitation in the Book of Job chap 10:2 he says Thou Hast granted me life and favor and thy visitation has preserved my spirit Psalms 102:13 David says Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor her yay the set time is come now I'll say what a prophet said he said May the power reach down and pick up the people and shake them Lord and let them realize that this is the day time amen the Lord has said see this is the time of of their healing so man can set times and man does things according to the time that he sets amen and man can fail because he's finite he's a human amen but when God sets a time or when God SCH something his calendar amen there's nothing in time that can defeat what God Amen desires to do from eternity I'll say every generation amen is promised to receive a great visitation when that visitation comes among that generation it is the season or the time or the hour amen when the promises of God for that age amen begin to come to pass he said I thank thee tonight for the Holy Ghost and for the visitation of him right here Amen in this building and even right here now the very Spirit according to the word of God which is infallible and cannot fail he said the same spirit that raised Jesus from the grave is right here in our midst right now listen friends the same spirit amen that raised Jesus from the grave amen is not in Jerusalem this morning it is not in a grave in Jeffersonville Indiana amen it is not buried in the mountains of Arizona amen but that spirit is right here amen at Carolina points amen and it is here to give you a visitation I'll say if there's ever been a time amen now is the time Amen to realize the seriousness amen of the visitation of God in this age it's the hour when the Gospel of Jesus Christ is being watered down it's being perverted it's being hybridized amen but at the same time that that's happening amen God has men of God Amen who are preaching it like it was in the days of Noah Amen to the world it's a fanaticism amen but to the believer it's glorious amen and it's welcoming to those who are willing Amen to come into the Ark of safety listen I'll say this the Ark of Safety is not a church amen the Ark of Safety is not a youth camp the Ark of Safety is not a school or an idea amen the Ark of Safety is none other amen than the Lord Jesus Christ amen we spoke of it to you Friday night how that Zion amen is the type of the Bride let me say this this is Zion's time amen of favor amen hello Zion amen hello Zion amen this is your time of favor amen let's just go ahead and get it out of the way your time of favor is not coming amen your time of favor is here let me say now is the time amen of the Divine favor for the sons of God John said behold what Manner amen of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called amen the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not amen because it knew him not he said but beloved now are we the son sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be amen but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is this is not in the future amen that we're going to be the sons of God that we're going to be the daughters of God and neither is it in the past amen that we were the sons of God or we were the daughters of God Amen but look at that word now it means at this time amen at the present amen at this very moment you are the sons of God let me say what a prophet said he said I did not come Amen to bring you a fear and scare he said I come to bring you away from the fear and scare that you're not going to be the sons of God Amen you always were the sons of God see now is the hour now is the time now is the accepted hour this is the acceptable year of the Lord now is when healing is supposed to be now is when Miracles take place now is when Christ is revealing himself here we are now not in the future the devil keeps pushing it off that's Catholicism he said now is the day this is the hour this is the time this is the place right now amen This Is The Day He said these things we are seeing today they could not happen 20 years ago or 40 years ago he said it's today it happens amen because this is the hour this is the time he says now is the time it's fulfilled why because God promised it and here it is listen there's not no need for healing in the Millennium there's no need for salvation in the Millennium listen there's no need amen well we just go ahead and preach a minute here amen we don't need to wait till we get in the Millennium to pick up our sword and fight amen but now is the time to pick up our sword amen and fight back against this devil listen young people amen somewhere sometime amen you got to settle the battle you got to whip the devil you got to you got to come to a victory on the Battle of whether you're a Son of God or not come on let me say this amen one Youth Camp I'm a son and I go back home and Monday I'm not and then next Youth Camp I'm a son and I go back home and I'm not amen I'll say this I believe on the morning of the Rapture amen there will not be people amen battling the facts of whether amen they are a son of God or not I believe there is is a place in Jesus Christ that a Believer can go so deep in God until there is a revelation amen that settles in the depths of their soul but let me say this your position amen does not change who you are if you're on the mountain you're a Son of God if you're in the valley you're a Son of God if you're sick you're a Son of God if you're well you're a Son of God if you're broke you're a Son of God if you're rich you're a Son of God listen if you got joy you're Son of God and if you're facing sadness you're a Son of God the devil does not determine who I am the word determines Who I Am the word has called me from before the foundation of the world listen I have not come here amen just as a church member we have come here as a Bible bride who is here to fulfill the promises of the children of God I want to draw from another prayer from the prophet he preaches the message the token 1963 at the end of that sermon he says and if there be a seed anywhere that's predestinated Lord to hear the word of this last day may they come now sweetly and humbly can I show you something he's not saying let them come hear the word and receive the seed he's saying they are the seed that's why they're coming to hear the word oh Church of the Living God you didn't come here this weekend to become the seed the reason you are here is because you have a seed in your soul it wasn't put there at the altar it wasn't put there at a prayer line it wasn't put there at a special meeting there was a seed that was put in your soul from before the foundation of the world and there ain't no devil can change it there ain't no Spirit can change it bad days can't change the fact that I come from the mind of God as a gene seed of God and I will return amen not as a jean seed but as a manifested attributes of what that seed was sent into this hze to manifest hey hey Hallelujah we didn't come here to become a seed we always were a seed he said they come here to hear the word of this last day he said may they come now sweetly and humbly watch this and lay their trophies down at the cross now watch a prophet turn a corner or their self as a trophy the grace of God that's called them and may they be filled with the Holy Spirit and display the token of the life of Jesus Christ in his resurrection as long as they remain here on Earth so this power that is coming into you by the word of the hour is actually causing you to display the grace of Jesus Christ let me just say this nobody has ever received a trophy but what they wanted to display it are you awake do you realize colleges have trophies but they're not out there in the back shop they have trophies and they're not over in a closet somewhere amen but those trophies are on display they're out in the front because somebody amen fought the Battle got the Victory and they want to see that there is a trophy of what we done look at this word trophy it is something gained or a achieved or given in Victory or Conquest it is especially when preserved or mounted as a memorial it is a representation of such a memorial as on a metal now this is the one I love brother Jason it's a game animal or fish amen it's a game animal or fish that is suitable for mounting as a trophy it is usually used attributively can I tell you what a prophet said about you he said there was a first pull and he said there was some little fish he said there was a second pull he said and there was some more little fish he said but then there was a third pull and he said that third pull scattered the little fish amen but it caught the rainbow traps oh Church of the Living God do you see who you are this morning you're not just a little blue gill you're not just a little carp or a little trout amen but you are a rainbow trout who has been captured by the word of the hour that you're living in listen you're not here Amen to display depression you're not here to display anxiety you're not here to display suicide and to display Hollywood you have been sent into this age by The Calling of Jesus Christ to display the victory of what God can do in the flesh of a redeemed son and daughter of God Amen a trophy is an expressed attribute of the victory I love what the prophet of God says God's Great secret that he had before the world began he said it was now back in the back part of God's mind he said there was something he trying and was going to achieve somebody say trying and going to amen it's one thing to try it's another thing to do and he had a motive in doing it so in order to let himself be expressed because before there was a Moon Star atam molecule or anything he was God but he exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was love in him was to be a father in him was to be a son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a Healer all these great attributes amen we see already expressed amen they were in God Amen you heard it last night amen the angels of God Amen could not manifest what a redeemed amen son and daughter of God can manifest can I just say it to you like this Amen brother brother Isaac there is God and he's a Healer he's a savior he's a deliverer amen he's a he's a redeemer amen he's a he's a lover he's a father amen and here's all the Angels brother Jason they're gathered around him and he shouts out I'm a Healer and they say yes Lord You're A Healer he says I'm a savior they say yes you're a savior he says no I'm a delivered they say oh yes you are delivered listen but they're not saying it by experience they're saying it by knowledge they know by knowledge that's what he is amen that's why the Angels can't give him what a son and daughter of God can that's why the Angels amen can't bless his name like a redeemed young person can listen the Angels can't tell him I was in a trap I was in a prison but the Holy Ghost come by my way but Landon can because God who is Rich and mercy has sent a message to release the authority and the quickening power to make it more than just an attribute but to make it an expression in the flesh of his church so when you raise your hands this morning and say he's a savior it does something for him thank you buddy when you raise your hands this morning and say Lord I was sick but I come in that prayer line and you healed me it does something for him when you say Lord I was empty hey but you sent the word and you healed me and you fed me it does something for him trophies of his attributes brother said you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as the Son of God he said but now you are expressed amen watch after his word has come in you to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son or a daughter of God you are now made you are sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate and God before there was a foundation of the world he knew that you would be here I think Josh Bennett said it the best way he said I'm here because I was there and he said because I'm there is why I'm here and he said because I'm here is why I'm going back there oh come on young people I pray to God you leave this Youth Camp with more than just a new phone number or a new friendship or a new little idea I pray you leave this Youth Camp with a revelation in your soul I come from God and I got to go back to God I didn't come from the devil I didn't come from leot SE I didn't come from the things of this world I have come from God I've got a theophany I've got a millennium to go to I've got a Rapture to take I got a future home Hallelujah what's happened the word of God has come into you and it's lit your souls you have come from Mortal beings from time beings to Eternal beings brother Jason you was just preaching my sermon before I got out here amen listen we become Sons and Daughters of God with the attributes the gene of God in us amen not on us but in us to be Sons and Daughters of the father brother comes along in future home and says now notice amen the thistles and the germs all sickness and things will be completely taken away all that's its existence that's in the earth now man-made systems politics thank God sin all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with all the heavens above us in here is contaminated with evil spirits he said all this exists in the heavens or the atmospheres and the Earth which is now see the Earth holds these things but it wasn't made for that purpose listen the Earth was not made meant to hold politics it was not made to hold Sodom it was not made to hold sodomites it was not come on church it was not made to hold amen Leota things he said see the Earth holds those things but it wasn't made for that purpose sin caused it to be like that and all of our bodies that we live in now was put on the earth when God created it because you're out of the Dust of the earth it was all late here when God himself created it you were in his thinking and then him the great Eternal which was the thought which is his attribute he said did you notice though that the heavens will pass away with a great noise listen the whole earth will be on fire and will ignite the gases that's in the earth and will explode it that's exactly right the Bible said Peter said the heavens will pass away and the Earth with a great noise amen such an explosion amen will rock it oh my C it's got to kill every disease every fistle every forn everything there is to be done amen the fire will burn it up I want to serve notice on every political devil on every Cancer devil on every depression devil I want to serve notice on every devil out of the pits of Hell there is a fire coming upon on this Earth that's going to burn it it's going to renovate it it's going to annihilate it you know when I say devil I say work while you got a chance because there's a fire coming there's a fire coming that's going to clean this hang up listen God ain't going to put his trophies in a trophy case that is full of germs and diseases and thorns and thistles and political divisions and political disturbances he's going to renovate his trophy dwelling place and put it where it should be remember it's not altogether just a literal fire it's also a holy fire see that will take away Satan and all of his Devils both Heaven and Earth amen will pass away now watch this it's killing all the ger all the insects all the natural life on it around it even the H2O the water now come on Church the water H2O is going to be so uh uh this fire that's coming is going to be so powerful that it's even going to ignite the water I can stop there and preach for an hour it's going to ignite the water listen friends water is what you use to put a fire out but this fire that's coming is so much powerful that it can't even withstand amen the fire of God listen friends amen but can I say this I don't have to wait for the Millennium to see the manifestation of the renovation of the fire of God I can stand here this morning and I can look at young people that that fire has already come upon you as a part of this Earth as a jean seed in your soul that fire has already renovated God's dwelling place and you got a soul in you that's the devil can't touch wait till this Earth receives her baptism hey but you've already received yours amen when I look in the message of the hour I find brother bradam amen will speak of you many times his trophies mainly when he does it he speaks of you in prayer he'll say trophies of this meeting trophies of the message trophies of the presence of the Lord trophies of the grace of God trophies of the spirit of Grace trophies of this revival trophies of Christ's love at Calvary trophies of the Gospel that has been preached he'll say trophies of your word being made manifest preached by the spirit of the Lord he'll say trophies of the message the evening light time now this is one of my favorite ones and and y'all just forgive me he says but trophies of the ministry of the seventh angel now I know a lot of people are ashamed Amen to be identified with the prophet of God Amen but I am not ashamed to say I believe William Brandon was the pro prophet of God until this age I am not ashamed to stand behind the pull pit and read a quote of a prophet of God I am not ashamed to display amen what a prophet has said and what a prophet has revealed I am not ashamed hey you know why I'm not ashamed because I'm a trophy I am a trophy of the ministry of the seventh angel somebody say well amen that's put a little bit too much on a man no I'm not talking about a man I'm talking about the son of man who was revealed through a son of man and claimed a bride to fulfill his promises through when you think about this trophies and brother random refers to Trophies is people I love this he always connects these scriptures to trophies in John 5:24 he'll say verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me ha everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life in John 6:37 all the father hath given me shall come and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out that's right another one John 10:28 can to to Trophies I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man any man pluck them out of my hand because my father which gave them to me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hands you know what I just feel like preaching on that point amen that devil tells you I'm going to get you I'm going to get you I'm going to get you amen let me just say this young people wise up to that dumb devil and looking back in the face and say devil if you was going to get me you would have done got me if you were going to successfully get me you would have done got me but the reason why you ain't got me is cuz you can't get me because before you tried to get me my God gave me to Jesus and he put a seed in my soul and he claimed me for the manifestation of the word of truth and life in the age I'm living in let me say it devil you ain't got enough to stop this bride you ain't got enough to stop this young people you ain't not enough to stop amen the manifestation of the gene life of God on fire in the middle of this evil age hallelujah hallelujah I love what the part of God said he said there he said they're the trophies of your word amen that condemned their sinful life think about that they are the trophies of your word that condemn their sinful life and they come to accept you as their personal savior so I'm pleading to you your promise bringing back to your remembrance that you said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me amen they now accept your word they are sorry for their sins and have demonstrated the same and manifested it by taking a stand for you tonight listen these messages that you've heard in the services and in the sessions amen can I tell you what theyve made you they have made you trophies because you've heard word that did not endorse a sin life it did not condone a Leo ofy a lukor Christian life but it condemned it and listen some of you all oh my can I just go ahead and say it amen the devil says you're condemned I'm just going to go ahead and say it he's condemned and he knows he's condemned that's why he wants to convince you that you're condemned because he knows he's condemned and headed for a lake of fire but he knows that you have a future can I just go ahead and say it to him and he's not in it you have a future and the devil is not in it what are you saying their trophies that God has given to his son Christ Jesus by the power of His presence and the word of God can I say this the message of the hour it's more than a religion it's more than a Sunday sermon or it's more than a book or a tape amen but the message of the hour is a claiming message you say preacher what do you mean he says I claim them for you tonight Jesus as your own personal treasure as gems in your crown amen as members of your bride I claim their lives now let me ask you this if something's going to claim you amen what is the something that claims you the prophet of God In The Sixth Seal he said May every child amen called child of God that's in hearing distance of here or either the tapes shall strike May at that time I claim them for the kingdom of God upon the basis of knowing this is the word that's being revealed so Church you don't claim this message but this message claimed you you was not looking for this message but this message was looking for you let me say this young people you were claimed on purpose for a purpose and by a purpose and let me just say this it's not an accident either you were claimed on purpose for a purpose and by a purpose can I just say it you were claimed in this age to be a trophy and what's claiming you is the revealing of the word in the age you're living in that's why I say if we're going to take a pullit let's say only what a prophet has already said I cannot claim you as a bride based on what Billy Graham taught I cannot claim you as a bride based on what or Roberts taught I can't even claim you as a bride based on what smiley face in Texas teaches but I can claim you based on the revelation of Jesus Christ underneath the author ity of the pillar of fire listen I didn't come here just for a church service I didn't come here just to preach a sermon I come here to draw my sword and stand Toe to Toe with that devil and say I claim every one of these young people for the manifestation of Truth for the manifestation of life and for the realities of God the unfailing realities of God to live and to manifest in their lives they say what are you talking about I'll just say this God's trophies Aren't Dead trophies all right they're living trophies according to Ephesians 2:5 he said wherein ye were dead look at this word dead spiritually dead amen destitute of a life that recognizes and is devoted to God listen you were dead in sin but you have be quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved can I say this here is those who were dead and has been raised up he said there is there is those here who were in accidents they were smashed up and they are healed you say preacher I got to die and go to heaven to be a trophy that's a lie of the devil he said I see Miss Wilson standing here that not long ago she was hemorrhaging to death with TB but here she is tonight amen the doctors didn't give her but just hours to live amen but here she stands tonight I love that here she stands tonight he said all around through here there's lame blind crippled in wheelchairs everything but look what a prophet says he said there's standing tonight as living trophies why because Jesus Christ lives he's the same yesterday today and forever do you see a position that the prophet of God put you in he didn't say here they are laying here they are sitting here they are barely getting by he said but here they are standing as trophies of the Living God do you know what Paul said he said having done all to stand amen then just stand therefore having your loin gir about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel but you know what I don't find in there I don't find any armor on your back I don't find any armor on your back or on your ankles or on come on church or the back of your head you know why because we don't run from this devil we run to this devil we don't back up from this devil we face this devil because we're not here under just a church visit ation he said we're here underneath the visitation of the Angel of the Lord he said if the deaf don't hear or the dumb don't speak the blind don't see the crippled don't walk if Prophecies of sin isn't foretold and the people and your sins from this time you as a child foretold them that believe that this Angel come to me is false I'm false with it but if it manifests itself here on the platform before you you believe it repent of your sins and disbelief for the hour of his visitation is Drawing Near for he only does these things to confirm his works now let me just say this when God makes a visitation to an age he doesn't do it unannounced he don't just walk in and say I'm here I just decided to come by no he announces it in his word see like the father was in the son all that was in God he poured into Christ right and all that was in Christ he has poured into you the church he said believe thou not that I'm in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself amen but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the father and the father is in me or else believe for the very word's sake verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'm talking about you and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father listen friends because Jesus ascended to the father and is Seated on the right hand of God in the Throne of majesty that does not mean that we're an idle Church without the power to operate the way he operated when he was here on the earth remember picks this up and said now in Jesus in his ministry the first thing verily verily which is absolutely I say unto you he that believeth on me amen The Works that I do he should do also and More Than This the word more translated is not greater because raised the dead sto nature there was nothing could be any greater than what he did but more than this shall you do for I go to my father do you believe that's the inspired word of God now the same thing he did he promised the church to do only more of it than what he did in St John 21:25 I love what John says he says there are also many other things which Jesus did the which if they should be written in everyone I suppose that even the world itself could not contain amen the books that should be written Amen in other words there's going to come amen so many victories in the lives of Believers by the power of the word of God that there's not even going to be able to be books wrote about it he said I wish I could testify for a little bit he said just tell you what I've seen happen last few weeks you know John and Luke said if or John Rather if all these things would be put in books there was enough books in the world to write it just what I've seen in my own Ministry what I've seen him do you couldn't pile the volumes on this platform here if I wrote in details what I seen him do in just my own Ministry see seen him do it see he had now listen to the prophet he had more success in my Ministry than he did in his own now remember he had more success now not me he had he had more success in Jeffersonville than he did in Nazareth he did in a wicked City amen glory cause he could perform no Miracles there listen he could perform no Miracles there because there was no seed Amen to recognize his visitation in the hour that they was living but in this generation there has been a seven seal book revealed and there is a seed in the heart of this young people listen he couldn't break through in Nazareth he couldn't break through in those Wicked cities he said but he finally broke through here he finally got it done here right here in Jeffersonville he might have had to get people somewhere else but he got it done anyhow now he had more success right here than he did in capernium or Nazareth he done more miracles right here in this Tabernacle that he did in the entire Ministry on Earth that's right he did now what about the rest of the world come on let's not leave this in Jeffersonville or in Tucson or in Hollywood or or not Hollywood Los Angeles is Hollywood amen let's not leave that there let's bring it right here Amen to to the North Carolina and South Carolina line let's bring it right here in the year of 2024 can I say this he broke through in this meeting he broke through in this meeting he broke through in power he broke through in anointing he broke through in Revelation he bro oh God and you know how he done it he done it by the preaching of the promises pertaining to the gene that he has put in this age you say now remember now remember here's what he said he done now it never said I done it amen see cuz I didn't do it I just didn't I just loved him and just submitted myself to him and said what he said and the Holy Spirit went to the other people and they believed what he said and then he done the work can I read that to you again I just loved him and just submitted myself to him and I said what he said and the Holy Spirit went to the other people and they believe what he said and then he done the work that's what he was saying in Luke 19 in 1 Peter 2 it was speaking of the day of visitation or the hour of visitation or the time of visitation you know what that day is also called it is also called the day of salvation the day or hour of visitation was speaking of the coming of the Messiah listen the very presence of God's Messiah amen the Son of God himself would return in the authority of his person would reveal himself come on church but what good does it do to reveal if there's nothing there to catch what's being revealed listen we would have one testimony here this weekend if there wasn't a seed in your soul to receive the preaching of the unadulterated word of God this meeting ain't built on music it ain't built on a hot guitar or a fast pet of drums this meeting is built on the preaching of the message of the hour as revealed by the seventh angel and as long as somebody will preach it God will put somebody in those pews to believe it and they'll accept it and the Holy Spirit will be liberated to move throughout the congregation come on church if they couldn't write books about Jesus and they couldn't write books about brother brandham then there is a five-fold Ministry in this Earth today who is carrying the same gospel can I just say this you're a part of those works you got a chapter in those volumes that can't be wrote about because Jesus has sent a word to catch you look here in Luke 19 I'm feeling good in Luke 19 when he come he beheld the city and he wept over it saying if thou had us known even thou at the least in this thy day the things which belong of thy peace but now they are HID from thine eyes for the day shall come upon thee that thine enemy shall cast a trench about thee and Compass thee roundabout and keep thee in on every side they shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee now I just want to take a Liberty here can I just can I just preach to you for a second from that amen let me say this thank God for elders who didn't kill the babies what are you talking about I'm not talking about natural abortion that's of the devil same as spiritual abortion is come on this message is a message of seed it's a message of progression when I say progression I mean it's a message of continuation when I say continuation I don't mean brother br's got to come back and do something I mean what he preached in is continuing in the Next Generation do you realize the Bible said amen that one generation shall receive the next are you hearing me and the Revival fires shall burn in the authority of the word upon that new generation young people let me say it as plain as I know how I salute you as a group of young people who has not watered this message down to a bunch of Daddy's religion and Mama's ideas and a preacher sermon but it has become a value to you it has become a way of walking and talking and believing you recognize your day of visitation you say what are you saying he only appears to those who are looking for him look at the woman at the well the woman said unto him I know look at that word know it means to have an interview with to visit she said I know that Messiah is coming which is called Christ and when he comes he will tell us all things Jesus saith unto her I but speak unto thee am he in other words quit looking for him he's here brother said the woman at the well she recognized her day by the sign of the Messiah when she recognized her hour of visitation you know what she become she become a trophy of his visitation but what done it was the grace of God to that woman's life she was a prostitute she had been married five times St John 4 New Testament she had been married five times and the one she was living with was not even her husband do you realize she did not have a voice of authority do you know that because of her condition nobody had to listen to her do you know when she was in that condition before she met the Messiah let me just break it down to you like this if there was a father and his son and they were out in town and the woman at the well was walking by that father told him his son if she says anything to you don't you listen to her don't you listen to her because she's a harlot and she don't have a position she don't have a right to say anything listen not even oh God not even the kids would listen to her not even the babies they would laugh in her face and walk on and do what they wanted to because of her present condition oh but then she met the master oh but then she met the Messiah oh but one day she had an interview with Jesus Jesus Christ one day she met him in the power of his resurrection one day she met him in the power of His word rather and she stood there and she looked at him and she said the Jews have nothing to do with the Samaritans he said if you knew who I was you would ask me for a drink Hey listen when she recognized the message of the hour the Bible says she dropped her water bucket and she ran into the city you know what she did she said come see a man 5 minutes before before that they didn't have to listen to her but the Bible says men listen to her and they followed her to find this Messiah can I just say it like I want to say it without this message we're nothing without this message we have no influence without this message we are another church I'm another preacher you're another teenager but if you ever come underneath the influence of the visitation of the Messiah to this generation you will go from no influence amen you're having such an influence that the devils in hell will fear you what are you saying I'm saying this message can take a prostitute and make a daughter of God out of her and cause other Sinners to meet him based upon the transformation of her life by the recognition of his visitation what are you saying I'm saying you want to be something quit looking at Michael Jordan you want to be something quit looking at Taylor Swift and every other ungodly influences crawled up out of the pitch of hell and the Flesh and lay out of see quit looking at those and Look Away to Jesus look at the seventh angel somebody say well Amen brother Andrew amen you're a young man you must have it made I didn't have it made amen I'll say this if I got anything today Gideon it's because of this message I'm not ashamed to say it I was a nobody on the back Hills of East Tennessee when the grace of God found me and revealed this message to me and he show me that there was a higher calling he showed me there was a place I could go in God that I could believe things that theologians were confused on and you know what I did I said yes Lord I'll follow you I'll follow your will I'll follow your word listen somebody say well you're awful strong on brother brandom it's because I know where I was without his message I know the confusion that my life was headed for without this message but God who is rich in Mercy picked up an old piece of tent tenness dur that was just a country boy but he saved me and he give me a family and he give me a testimony I'm going to fight back against ever devil that tries to squash the influence of the visitation of the Messiah in this generation I say House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ in power and [Music] manifestation Hallelujah Hallelujah there's bigger fish I went the other day I was down I was in Tennessee down home and I just riding around there and went to some old fishing spots went where my great granddaddy used to take me and you know brother Donnie over there in that little hole I had a little fishing spot that I just loved you know why CUA little fish they just stayed there so I'd go down there and I'd catch little fish all day long and I thought it was the Great thing in the world I'll never forget one day brother Joel my granddaddy was sitting up on the bank there he holler down he said hey he said move on out in the water I said what do you mean he said move on out in the water I said wait a second granddaddy I'm catching fish he said but there's bigger fish all right I said well why have I got to get out in the water he said you got to get where they're at I said oh okay so I started waiting out in other words brother Jason I started an ankle deep water and then I went to Knee Deep Water and then I went to waste deep water but then I just got over in the swimming Waters come on Church what are you saying I'm saying Jesus found Peter and he saved him and he said Peter you've been a fisher of fish but today I'm going to make you a fisher of men and you know what the Bible says the Bible said he threw his net down and he said Lord I'll follow you and God took a man who was full of mistakes but had more Revelation he was full of mistakes but God used him to catch an influence others listen I'm not here to point you to Andrew Clover I'm not here to point you to any Ministry I'm here to say there is a message and it's a Vindicated message and whatever a prophet T it's the truth I don't care who says it's not I don't care who tries to bring their opinion or their little religious education behind the pulpit and contradict what a prophet said I've got the grace of the aesan church age to say you're a liar and you're not saying what a prophet said and if you ain't going to say what the prophet said get out of the way and let somebody up who will to help this next Generation believe that what a prophet taught is the truth it's the truth what are you saying I'm saying when God sends a visitation you'll either recognize it or you will reject it and if you reject it you will continue on as the rest of the others have but look at Abraham I love this one the Bible says Abraham and Sarah were sitting in the tent and the Sarah and Abraham hastened and said make ready three quickly three measures of fine meal needed and make cakes upon the Hearth and Abraham ran to the herd fetch a calf tender oh God and good and give it unto a young man and he he hastened to dress it and he took butter and milk you know it was good if there was some butter in it that's the South coming out and the calf which he had dressed and said before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat said what happened is Abraham was sitting in the door of his tent on a real hot day there was a lot of complaints about the message I mean there was a lot of complaints and the grass was all gone and the land was drying up and the cattle was becoming very thin the water supply was just about all gone they found water holes in the land and the water got low they would dig out and dig out until they got down to where the water was sweeping through the rocks and still the cattle didn't have enough water to supply the he said you know sometimes when things are going wrong We Know by Nature it's the darkest amen just before day and many times we see disastrous things happening like that especially to the Believers we must bear this in mind that it's Satan trying to block amen the blessing that's on its Road somebody say the blessing somebody preach with me the blessing you say the blessing what is the blessing the blessing is the promise of a body change to bring forth a promised son now can I just say something to you here I I love studying brother Brandon cuz he just brings out things you'll never catch he said Satan was trying to tempt them to feel that they had done wrong wow Satan was trying to tempt them to feel they had done wrong when the blessing was on its way the devil was tempting them to tell them you've done wrong you know why he was doing that so when the blessing showed up they would not entertain it he was trying to block the oncoming visitation that God was going to give to Abraham and Sarah right at the time of visitation Satan reaches over into the inner sense of f or the outer sense rather of F and begins to make them feel like they've done wrong makes them feel they're not worthy of the visitation because Satan oh God Satan did not want them to become a visitation trophy of elohim's visitation he said Abraham was sitting under his tent there come two angels and God walking up to him in human flesh they had dust on their clothes they were weary and they sat down he said oh my and Abraham killed the cow he got some butter he got some buttermilk he took it out there and set it down and God eat it he said Hallelujah that's the reason my faith looks up to thee thou lamb of Calvary you think that's a big thing for God God who made all the God God who made all the potach and calciums and everything in the world he come down to visit Abraham oh Church of the Living God I pray you put your joy shoes on this morning you are a part of the Seed of Abraham I say this morning the same Elohim that visited Abraham has been promised and prophesied to return to this generation what are you saying I'm saying God promised a gentile period would have a message or a visitation with Elohim not 61 the Paradox he said the Gentiles message amen it started by a visitation of the pillar of fire and it ends the same way in the unveiling of God brother says this he said oh what is it in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh is this okay and dwelt Among Us you know what he said he said oh there it is it's Elohim again young people wake up it's eloh him again this is more than a feeling this is more than just a little sermon this is more than just a little Camp riding some go-karts and playing some games this is Elohim visiting you in the power of his word to fulfill his promise come on this ain't just a little church service this ain't just brother Jason and brother Matt and let's just see what we can do and what we can produce and make a name for ourselves no they have raised up a place that young people can come for to have a visitation with Elohim to fellowship with MDC what are you saying I say this our visitation has come to us in the form of the message of the hour can I stir up your minds by the pure way of remembrance this morning the Bible said that the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way give me that first picture and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day the other picture the first one the other one one two 3 one to go before them by day and night he took not away thank you the pillar of cloud by day we love our s guys don't we give them a hand and our audio guys and visual guys sometimes you get to preaching and you say things and people think man the preachers MTH the world at them no we'll eat a steak someday By Night by day he took not away the pillar of cloud by day with butter on it Lord the pillar of Fire by night from before the people in 1950 the pillar of fire appeared in Houston Coliseum but look where it's no go back but look where it's at it's hanging over a prophet's head he it's hanging there amen as a headship it's hang hanging there as a visitation now can I show you something where is brother brandom at in the picture he's not above the pillar of fire he's beneath the pillar of fire in other words where is this microphone at it's not above my head it's underneath my mouth so what I'm saying I'm using a microphone to say it the pillar of fire had taken brother brandom as a microphone for the revelation of Elohim in this generation and he claimed his body to begin to speak the thoughts of God that was on the back part of God's mind you know what he did he stood there Thomas and he said things contrary to what the Baptist called he said things contrary to what religious leaders T you know why because it was Elohim who was not going to be stopped by the denomination because there was a blessing in what a prophet was going to say oh young people if you don't get nothing else get this you're blessed I said you're blessed I don't know what you're going home to I don't know what situations you're facing but there is a blessing of God upon your life can I tell you what it is it's an irreversible blessing in other words God puts it on you and the devil can't do nothing about it God puts it on you and the devil can't change it you're blessed because of the message of the hour behold I will send you Elijah the prophet amen give me that second picture of the cloud Revelation 101 I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clo with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire 1963 the Third Exodus there it is they don't know what it's all about the scientists are trying to and anybody got a picture of it called in quote a cloud 26 Mi high in the shape of a pyramid I don't have time to bog down in these areas but I'm just going to lay some some things here seven angels represent in there watch this and brought back and brought you the word of God when Elohim came to Abraham and Sarah he was bringing them the confirmation of the Covenant of blessing upon their life to change their bodies to produce the promised son oh young people I can't help but get excited I can't help but get enthused that in 1962 there was a cloud appeared and it was more than just a cloud it was more than just a scientific object it was Elohim returning to this generation in a visitation of his word listen and brought you the word of God under the inspiration it tells you these hours you're coming and living in and the spirit spiritual mind will'll pick it right now see and get it it's an exodus oh Hallelujah well glory to God somebody shout hallelujah brother Carl it's an exodus in the house of God let me say devil fight us while you can torment us why you can we're going to leave here one of these mornings the word of God has been restored by the visitation of Elohim in my generation I'm standing on the sayth the Lord I'm standing on Vindicated word and the devil can't do nothing about [Applause] it somebody say praise God God but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound give me that third picture we seen the pillar of fire above him we seen the cloud come down but in 1900s he stands behind the pull pit and what's he doing preaching so anybody tells you preaching ain't important is a ly devil it's a dangerous spot I got a sword anybody that tells you preaching is foolish it is but it's the way men are saved and if anybody tells you that you don't need to have a preacher because you got a Prophet that's a Lon Spirit from the pits of Hell will the real brother brandom didn't teach that nonsense come on I'm just going to go ahead and cut that devil's head off because we got a generation now that don't even know what it means to go to church because all of a sudden everything's done at home they stream at home they listen at home but let me say what the Bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together I say young people rise up as a generation who has recognized the visitation of Elohim and strike Bel on this way out of see and devil that's crawled in this message and it's trying to empty our churches and empty our pulpits I refuse to believe that the church is in vain and that every preacher is false I reject that devil in the name of Jesus and I say by the word of Truth God is going to raise up preachers here he's going to raise up beacons here he's going to raise up song leaders and Sunday school teachers and Holy Ghost filled church members that knows what it's like to be the Church of the firstborn [Applause] brother B didn't teach that somebody told me one time lady sorry brother Jason I guess my contracts up so I just have fun this morning somebody told me one time you know what they said they said you know what brother Andrew said that was from the said that that going not going to church ask the Lord I said funny thing to me is God built churches and Tabernacles and put Ministry in them and all of a sudden the church is useless might say well the way it ought to be is just stay home and listen to a tape well let me tell you what brother BR said about that are you ready for it got your pen and pencil down ready to write it down it wasn't so from the beginning now either he's a word Prophet or we're following another Theologian but I propose to you this morning he was the voice of authority on every scripture in this Bible he was the voice of authority on Hebrews 10:25 and what he said oh here it is brother Donnie if you got God in your heart you can't wait for them doors to get open so we just solved the problem God ain't in your heart but if God was in your heart you couldn't wait to get to the house of God and shake your brother's hand and hug your sister's neck and sing the songs of son but oh Joshua generation rise up this morning with an Elohim Revelation and Strike Back Against that devil and walk don't just walk that God sent a prophet walk in what he said walk in what he Tau a Divine or a man that's tell future events were coming to pass then we come to pass exactly without failure hear him for I am with him let me bring this down Revelation 138 so when he stands there and begins to preach the pillar of fire that's above him you now see it all over him that's right so now he's speaking the word and he's beginning to say things like all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world Revelation 178 the Beast that thou sawest wasn't is not and shall Ascend out the bom's pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder you're on the earth this morning they shall Wonder but listen you're not wondering why are you not wondering whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation world when the Beast behold was is not and yet is butam comes in 1963 in the first seal and he says now listen here now real close now listen you won't have to wonder no more what it is elohim's visitation to this generation was the ending of wondering that's right let me close on this but there before God can pour out his judgment Upon A people he has to make a way of Escape for everyone who desires to receive it this is your day of visitation I'm just going to say what your Prophet said you might not want to believe it because an uneducated Minister said it but don't pay attention to the messenger pay attention to the message you're hearing are you ready before it 1965 birth pains oh word Believers oh word Believers how many's here this morning let me see your hand give in to my message hear me not my message but his message that he firmly declares to be the truth what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying when this message begins to sound It's the Return of the entire deity of God amongst people it's the visitation of preparation for translation the next thing coming for you young people is a translation come on Church you say brother Andrew I hate I got to go home can I say this brother get in we might start home but all of a sudden we might be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and our loved ones begin to appear are you hearing me he said the old world is just right for judgment it won't be long till it'll be over but oh father while the hour of visitation is here grant that your children will see Lord quickly May great faith be built translating Faith great faith that'll just make the people be ready for the great translation you say what is this translation it's a translation from the Hall of critics to the Hall of Fame every great picture before it can be hung in a Hall of Fame and has to go through the Hall of critics and I believe the little churches went through the Hall of critics and now soon there'll come a scream from the heavens and God is going to hang it in the Hall of Fame to take it out by the Rapture to take it up to Glory you say preacher what is the rapture the Rapture is the Gathering of the trophies of elohim's visitation I know people say well we've heard this before but I'm going to say again rapturing faith is on those tapes rapturing faith is on those tapes now listen what a prophet said he said now there are afflictions that are done and brought about to see what attitudes you'll take to see it to it see it's God on this proven ground that's all the Earth is is the proven grounds and where he's trying to prove you The Proving Grounds on the earth is here before the Rapture of the church what are you saying brother Ander I'm saying this that you are expression of almighty God oh my I'm out of time God is going to use your flesh y'all ever heard of a man named Garnet Peak down in campbellfield Kentucky brother B said like this he said there was Garnet Peak he said I go down there you can go listen to it I am the resurrection he said I'd go down there and visit Garnet he said he'd always be having Bible studies and sharing things he said he was struck with polio as a kid and said he was in bad shape he said but there never was a time I ever went by there he said but what Garnet didn't have something to say or something encouraging he said one time I asked him a question I said Garnet perhaps what if this had never happened to you I said I was called s up here tonight there had been a young boy by the name of garnet Peaks that had just got killed out here on the highway with his car and the boy was drunk and his soul had gone on to meet God or would you rather just keep the scene the way it is garet a crippled a crippled boy in a in a polio condition and brother said would you rather be in that condition or would you rather be in this condition now here's his words just let it be the way it is as long as I know Jesus the way I know him it's more than life even though I'd have to stay here all my life in this condition he said I want to show you brother Brandon I'm much better he could move his he could move his arms and so forth with great anticipation he was looking for the time that he would be well so he could walk around he said I'm an old man seen much in my days I don't ever believe I met a more galled spirited boy than Garnet peaks in that condition but brother Jason amen can can I leave you fish young people can I leave you with something I don't know the conditions of your life but I want you to leave with this you're going to be a trophy over that condition you're
