[1:10:43] cry
[1:10:45] hallelujah thank you
[1:10:51] Jesus and so I just want to read with
[1:10:54] you a quote of brother brandom if you
[1:10:56] just put that up brother slide number
[1:10:58] one and then we're going to turn to the
[1:11:01] book of Acts chapter 2 This was um after
[1:11:05] the seals in June 1st brother brandham
[1:11:07] was with some young
[1:11:10] people uh one of uh sister Rebecca
[1:11:13] brandom Smith's friends was um
[1:11:17] graduating and they were having a
[1:11:19] graduation and brother brandham spoke
[1:11:21] this to those that were gathered in that
[1:11:24] service Lord Jesus we are grateful for
[1:11:27] this time to know that we're assembled
[1:11:31] here the young and old and the
[1:11:34] middle-aged and we have assembled this
[1:11:36] side of
[1:11:37] Eternity once more to speak about you
[1:11:41] and about the things that pertains to
[1:11:43] everlasting life and these young ones
[1:11:46] sitting in here tonight some of them are
[1:11:50] graduating and some have have already
[1:11:55] graduated but I realize Lord something
[1:11:59] that happened this is June and we know
[1:12:03] something happened in the mountains
[1:12:04] there and February and March as those
[1:12:08] angels came down and brother brandham
[1:12:09] went back and preached the opening of
[1:12:11] The Seven Seals but he said he's
[1:12:14] remembering this at a youth meeting amen
[1:12:18] I realized Lord something that happened
[1:12:20] just a few hours before that great shock
[1:12:23] or great blast had taken place in the
[1:12:26] mountain up there north of Tucson when
[1:12:29] the angels of the Lord came down I
[1:12:32] remember what was said and
[1:12:35] especially about the young people amen
[1:12:38] and I pray thee Lord to help us to
[1:12:41] understand and may I be able to say
[1:12:44] something to these young folks tonight
[1:12:46] that will help them along the journey
[1:12:49] for Lord we all need that help at this
[1:12:53] time
[1:12:54] I wonder tonight if we could just
[1:12:56] agree when brother brandom I'm trying to
[1:12:59] go back maybe you could go back to the
[1:13:00] first side Brothers for
[1:13:03] us The Young and the old and the
[1:13:06] middleaged that were
[1:13:08] gathered but he's
[1:13:11] remembering when those angels came down
[1:13:13] and when the angels of the Lord came
[1:13:15] down I remember what was said and
[1:13:17] especially about the young people who
[1:13:20] would like to know what was on the heart
[1:13:21] of God when he was coming
[1:13:24] down Hallelujah must have been something
[1:13:27] very sacred for a prophet to remember
[1:13:30] that when he was with young people he
[1:13:32] had a burden for them and so tonight as
[1:13:35] we stand to our feet and turn to Acts
[1:13:37] chapter
[1:13:40] 2 that is our title Upper Room
[1:13:44] youth Lord Upper Room
[1:13:48] Youth and so now let's just go together
[1:13:52] into the presence of the the
[1:13:54] Lord and let the door close behind us
[1:13:58] from anything that might be in your
[1:14:00] heart or in your
[1:14:02] mind let's just let the Lord have his
[1:14:05] way I believe tonight's service is
[1:14:08] ordained of the
[1:14:10] Lord and I believe the atmosphere is
[1:14:13] just right for the supernatural to
[1:14:16] happen Acts chapter 2 most of you know
[1:14:20] in verse one that the day of Pentecost
[1:14:22] had ful come which was 50 days and they
[1:14:26] were all together in one place
[1:14:29] and the Holy Ghost fell amongst them I I
[1:14:34] would just love for that to happen
[1:14:37] tonight just all of us would be
[1:14:41] filled not just the elders or the ones
[1:14:44] in the back but from the youngest to the
[1:14:46] oldest there could be such a Harmony and
[1:14:50] such a flowing of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:54] that no matter what any
[1:14:55] person has gone through that the great
[1:14:59] physician that would be able to deal
[1:15:00] with every case so personal and even
[1:15:05] someone on the internet could just pull
[1:15:07] God so strongly you wonder why brother
[1:15:09] John might go in a direction maybe
[1:15:11] that's for somebody that's crying out
[1:15:13] like a sheep just crying out and I
[1:15:17] believe he's he's in the building
[1:15:18] tonight our lord Jesus is
[1:15:21] near so now verse 14 is where we want to
[1:15:24] start the holy spirit is poured out upon
[1:15:28] 120 and people were mocking them and
[1:15:31] saying they are have new wine but Peter
[1:15:35] verse
[1:15:37] 14 standing up with the
[1:15:40] 11 lifted up his
[1:15:43] voice and said unto them ye men of Judea
[1:15:47] and all ye that dwell at
[1:15:49] Jerusalem be it this known unto you and
[1:15:53] hearken to my
[1:15:56] words this is the same Peter that just a
[1:16:00] few days before was cursing swearing
[1:16:04] saying I don't even know the
[1:16:06] man and just 50 days later less than two
[1:16:12] months he's busting out of a room saying
[1:16:15] give me the
[1:16:16] microphone that's what it was saying I
[1:16:18] got something to
[1:16:19] say and I'll give that much grace for
[1:16:22] any person here
[1:16:24] you might be a coward backsliding
[1:16:27] demon-possessed have a religious spirit
[1:16:30] on you just in a matter of days you
[1:16:33] could be a totally different
[1:16:36] person what God did for that book of
[1:16:38] Acts church and what happened in the
[1:16:41] upper room here We Are Tonight Upper
[1:16:44] Room youth am the same blessing is on
[1:16:48] you same promisees unto you and your
[1:16:51] children you don't need to tear and wait
[1:16:54] it just while you're in the service the
[1:16:57] atmosphere just yield to it now I
[1:17:00] already know the devil's nervous because
[1:17:02] he already knows brother John's notes
[1:17:04] all of our slides and uh and the Lord
[1:17:08] Jesus knows exactly what he wants to say
[1:17:10] tonight the devil's
[1:17:12] nervous so don't you get nervous I'm not
[1:17:15] nervous I'm just fine praise the Lord
[1:17:18] I'm like a doctor that's just walked
[1:17:21] into a room and I'm all alone with you
[1:17:24] and the nurse has done the thing and
[1:17:26] you've checked in we all checked in
[1:17:28] tonight right don't check out we're all
[1:17:31] checked in and we're just
[1:17:33] waiting we're just waiting on the Lord
[1:17:36] to come and speak to us here's Peter
[1:17:39] says I've got something to say verse 15
[1:17:42] these young people or these people that
[1:17:44] you see are not drunken as you suppose
[1:17:47] seeing it is but the third hour of the
[1:17:49] day but
[1:17:51] this is that
[1:17:54] is that what the Bible says this that
[1:17:57] you see going on is that which was
[1:18:00] spoken by the prophet Joel We read that
[1:18:03] last night in Joel yeah chapter 2 and if
[1:18:07] brother John would have been a better
[1:18:08] preacher I would have got all through in
[1:18:10] one service and it would have been a
[1:18:11] very nice package brother Jason you when
[1:18:13] I grow up I'll be able to preach nice
[1:18:16] but Joel chapter 2 was a prophecy of
[1:18:20] Joel I will restore amen
[1:18:23] now it's happening in the congregation
[1:18:25] young people old people and and Peter is
[1:18:30] recognizing what you see going on this
[1:18:33] is that which was spoken by the prophet
[1:18:37] Joel amen so tonight I'm announcing to
[1:18:41] you this that is happening in Buford
[1:18:44] South Carolina is that which was spoken

[1:43:18] a special
[1:43:19] tonight they're not going to get the
[1:43:21] microphone and show off a bunch of blood
[1:43:23] and everybody would just be like what
[1:43:25] what's the sister doing like she needs
[1:43:28] help I'm making a point right
[1:43:33] now we wouldn't have asked that group to
[1:43:35] sang tonight if if they're standing here
[1:43:38] singing and and then blood started
[1:43:40] dripping off their
[1:43:42] dress some of you would she needs help

[1:43:59] help that than we do to spiritual
[1:44:04] needs that sit right Among Us they sit

[1:44:15] from this rain that this thunderstorm
[1:44:17] that's happening outside do y'all hear
[1:44:18] that yeah we would be getting hailes
[1:44:21] everywhere instead of saying Lord what's
[1:44:23] causing that drip on what caused that
[1:44:25] blood don't you know what caused this on
[1:44:27] this brother or sister we it's it's the
[1:44:31] mind of Christ to turn our attention
[1:44:33] they need
[1:44:34] healing they need Deliverance they don't
[1:44:37] need someone to put a little a little
[1:44:40] bit of something and say I hope that it
[1:44:42] comes down and gets in there we got a
[1:44:44] problem here no we'd have deacons we'd
[1:44:46] have putting tarps out we don't want it
[1:44:48] to be a
[1:44:49] distraction this this is our second

[1:45:07] year but it's like a memory it's like
[1:45:10] something that happened it was an
[1:45:13] experience but tonight it might be four
[1:45:17] months later and it just looks like it's
[1:45:20] not normal but it's a
[1:45:23] scar it's evidence that you made it
[1:45:26] through all right that's how a lot of us
[1:45:29] are going to look when the Rapture
[1:45:30] happens we made it
[1:45:32] [Applause]
[1:45:39] too I'm speaking about upper room youth
[1:45:42] I I really had this and I even wrote it
[1:45:45] down what was the youth like on the day
[1:45:47] of
[1:45:48] Pentecost the young people that were
[1:45:50] were in that room and the youth today
[1:45:54] that are in the message I I believe if
[1:45:56] they were filled with the same Spirit
[1:45:58] would have the same
[1:46:00] nature do yall believe that they young
[1:46:03] ladies young men they would have the
[1:46:05] same life and the same character Amen in
[1:46:08] the upper room they were just
[1:46:12] waiting God help us amen I hope we
[1:46:16] wouldn't have been sitting over in the
[1:46:17] corner texting uhoh I'm come on man it's
[1:46:21] nine
[1:46:22] days where's the
[1:46:26] action that's good for my mom it's good
[1:46:29] for my dad you know I had to come to CH
[1:46:31] and we get in at it like it's nine
[1:46:37] days this a bad
[1:46:39] attitude instead of Leaning forward and
[1:46:42] saying oh God it's been nine
[1:46:45] days when where is the promise of your
[1:46:48] power where how long is this going to go
[1:46:52] Lord but on the 10th day it
[1:46:55] happened and those young people if you
[1:46:58] read Acts 2 all of them were filled with
[1:47:01] the Holy
[1:47:03] Ghost amen so the 10 days prepared them
[1:47:08] yes for whatever God was going to
[1:47:11] do don't you want to be Upper Room youth

[1:47:19] whatever God has for us they they
[1:47:22] weren't talking about everybody running
[1:47:24] in the garden and everybody can't pray
[1:47:26] for an hour and y'all know what I'm
[1:47:28] talking about and oh you know Judas did
[1:47:31] this they weren't talking about people
[1:47:33] that left the
[1:47:35] message and we're not setting up a
[1:47:37] committee to go after
[1:47:39] them it's the holy spirit that has to go
[1:47:42] after
[1:47:43] them I mean I'm very aware of people
[1:47:46] that weren't even in the church services
[1:47:48] but there begin to be a move of of the
[1:47:50] Holy Ghost and God doing something God
[1:47:52] brought his predestinated to the house
[1:47:56] of God there are people streaming this
[1:47:58] service right now that you don't know

[1:48:44] life from now to the Rapture to The
[1:48:47] Checkered Flag it's all going to be

[1:55:13] them tonight she said I'm not going to
[1:55:15] wear those
[1:55:16] sandals I so embarrassed her at
[1:55:18] Louisiana she walked out out of the the
[1:55:20] room the the he's going to embarrass me
[1:55:23] she just walked out of the service
[1:55:25] that's not a good
[1:55:28] sign so stop talking about people only
[1:55:31] say positive
[1:55:33] things this is maybe what it looked like
[1:55:35] in the upper
[1:55:36] room God had had enough of being on the
[1:55:40] outside of his people he had had enough
[1:55:43] of being above his people he had had
[1:55:45] enough of just being Jesus with his
[1:55:48] people he want wanted to come inside of
[1:55:50] his
[1:55:51] people so this is the upper room this is
[1:55:54] a little was it like this where there
[1:55:56] was tongues of fire GL upon each of them
[1:56:00] the Bible says young old what whoever
[1:56:03] was in that room got the Holy Ghost I
[1:56:07] tell you what put me in a room with some
[1:56:10] people that believe like
[1:56:13] that
[1:56:15] [Applause]
[1:56:18] Hallelujah glory to
[1:56:21] God and it fixed
[1:56:24] everything it took care of everything
[1:56:28] and all of the disciples that were in
[1:56:30] that room were martyred
[1:56:33] yeah they gave their
[1:56:36] life all of the disciples except for
[1:56:39] John and they tried to boil it out of
[1:56:41] him they put him in a vat full of
[1:56:43] boiling oil to boil out the Holy Ghost
[1:56:47] and there was so much dynamic and
[1:56:49] quickening Power in brother
[1:56:52] John it was like being in a hot tub
[1:56:55] maybe I don't know but he was still
[1:56:58] alive they say oh man we tried to get
[1:57:00] him with them we tried to get Shadrach
[1:57:02] meach and abedo and all our strong
[1:57:05] Mighty soldiers they're dying dying and
[1:57:08] here come Shadrach Meshach and abedo
[1:57:10] come falling into the fire and it just
[1:57:13] burns off their bands and goodness and
[1:57:16] God said you know what I've had enough
[1:57:17] of it just being three I'm going to go
[1:57:19] down and visit
[1:57:20] them I'm going to be a witness to those
[1:57:23] young men that I'm with
[1:57:25] them you know wormwood wanted to come
[1:57:28] and other Angels you know blow up the
[1:57:30] furnace fire send a bunch of rain you
[1:57:33] know God says no I appreciate all you
[1:57:36] lovely Angels but this is my this is my
[1:57:39] time I'm going to go down there I think
[1:57:41] it's about like tonight the Lord saw
[1:57:43] last night and
[1:57:45] today and how you all you know it was
[1:57:49] just lovely today I there was only one
[1:57:52] moment that I saw something as a little
[1:57:54] out of order and one of our sisters she
[1:57:56] was just going at it going at it with
[1:57:57] somebody I just kind of listen a little
[1:57:59] bit she's just probably strong
[1:58:03] wheed maybe a little stubborn it
[1:58:06] probably wasn't even a bad thing I
[1:58:08] probably just misunderstood but she was
[1:58:12] exercised I better move along if I would
[1:58:15] have said a brother then he was like oh

[2:02:09] [Applause]
[2:02:17] me he's a song leader you know she's G
[2:02:20] great testimonies you know they're the
[2:02:22] pastor's children they're the great
[2:02:24] grandchildren it doesn't
[2:02:30] matter there was issues there was needs
[2:02:33] there's hurts there's
[2:02:39] wounds this was brother brandham
[2:02:41] speaking that that series of meetings
[2:02:43] you can see the thousands of
[2:02:45] people you can see this is a picture
[2:02:49] from the
[2:02:50] front do y'all see those stretchers
[2:02:52] right in front how many can see those
[2:02:54] raise your hand you I know it's hard to
[2:02:57] see but just write down they're just
[2:02:59] they're just laying
[2:03:02] there when the song leader said let's
[2:03:04] all stand and give God glory and give
[2:03:07] him praise they just laid
[2:03:10] there I don't have the strength
[2:03:14] brother I'm
[2:03:17] waiting I'm just trusting by the end of
[2:03:20] the service something I don't want to
[2:03:23] get rolled back out of these
[2:03:27] doors I'm not going to lay here through
[2:03:30] a song service an hour song Ser through
[2:03:34] somebody
[2:03:37] preaching and then go home go out in my
[2:03:40] van in my car and be the
[2:03:44] same let's all just agree together would
[2:03:47] that be horrible amen
[2:03:51] amen then why don't we just invite the
[2:03:54] great physician to come into the
[2:03:56] meeting why don't we invite the great
[2:03:58] physician to the
[2:03:59] pulpit why don't we just let the Lord
[2:04:02] Jesus come and say whatever needs to be
[2:04:04] said right then we'd really shout the
[2:04:08] Victory and it wouldn't be forced it
[2:04:11] would be from the from the bottom of our
[2:04:14] hearts the healer is here we say oh God
[2:04:19] Hallelujah I've got
[2:04:21] issues maybe for years I just if I can
[2:04:25] just touch his
[2:04:27] suit I know I'd be
[2:04:31] whole we need that attitude more in the
[2:04:34] message instead of the critical Spirits
[2:04:38] or what can that preacher tell me that I
[2:04:41] haven't heard before probably
[2:04:43] nothing but the Lord Jesus coming by
[2:04:46] here tonight has enough power to speak
[2:04:49] your name and you walk from as a dead
[2:04:52] person you walk out alive like Lazarus
[2:04:55] and brother brandom said there was so
[2:04:57] much power in his words that if he would
[2:04:59] have said
[2:05:01] arise every dead person would have rose
[2:05:04] from the dead but he said Lazarus
[2:05:07] arise so Lazarus walked out of
[2:05:11] there how many would just say God speak
[2:05:14] to me
[2:05:16] Lord I got about an eighth of who would
[2:05:19] say God speak to me
[2:05:21] [Applause]
[2:05:22] Lord maybe you're fine tonight maybe
[2:05:25] everything's good at your house start
[2:05:28] pulling for somebody else that's on the
[2:05:30] edge of their
[2:05:32] seat look at
[2:05:34] this so God
[2:05:37] finally said in 1963 I'm going to come
[2:05:42] down and make my presence
[2:05:45] knowing he came down visibly he was so
[2:05:49] close just a few days after this in the
[2:05:52] brandham
[2:05:53] Tabernacle that he was right with his
[2:05:56] prophet and brother brandham said only
[2:05:59] the lamb is worthy to break the
[2:06:01] seals brother brandham didn't break the
[2:06:04] Seven Seals it was the lamb standing
[2:06:06] behind the pulpit and brother brandham
[2:06:09] got worked up and people were pulling
[2:06:11] pulling what's the meaning of this seals
[2:06:13] and he would say things and he would say
[2:06:15] is something wrong is everybody okay is
[2:06:19] there is someone sick no go back and
[2:06:21] read that verse again and he read it
[2:06:23] again he said oh I was about I said that
[2:06:27] wrong how many would say God we need
[2:06:30] young people that are more that way the
[2:06:33] angel of the Lord is standing with you
[2:06:36] he's fighting your battles he's waving
[2:06:38] off the
[2:06:40] enemy I think I got about half of you on
[2:06:43] board who would really like that
[2:06:45] experience the the lord loves to be
[2:06:47] around you and he's fighting your battle
[2:06:51] and he's waving off the fiery darts cuz
[2:06:54] he's give you a shield of faith and he's
[2:06:57] given you strength what good is a sword
[2:07:00] if you don't have the strength to lift
[2:07:01] it up so he gives you power he gives you
[2:07:04] strength he puts strength inside of
[2:07:10] [Applause]
[2:07:13] you so the Lord Jesus appeared and I
[2:07:16] want to make this clear tonight and I
[2:07:17] know we're on the internet
[2:07:19] and that's just fine William brandham
[2:07:21] was not a Divine healer Jesus Christ is
[2:07:24] the
[2:07:26] Healer and he chooses to flow through
[2:07:29] vessels that he has ordained to manifest
[2:07:32] his power and you just happen to be one
[2:07:35] of those and I happen to be one of those
[2:07:39] but we're like an electrical uh
[2:07:41] something we need to be plugged into the
[2:07:43] power
[2:07:44] source that's what some of you been good
[2:07:47] boys and good girls and good people for
[2:07:49] years and you have the mechanics all in
[2:07:52] order and you're just right for a real
[2:07:54] Dynamic
[2:07:57] move and I would just throw up my heart
[2:07:59] and say here am I
[2:08:03] Lord wrestle it
[2:08:06] out just wrestle all night if you have
[2:08:12] to how many remembers that one service
[2:08:15] brother Brandon preached the whole
[2:08:16] service and he's preaching about Isaiah
[2:08:18] and things and then he said okay come to
[2:08:21] the end of the service he said everyone
[2:08:23] bow your heads is there anybody here
[2:08:26] that would like to just say raise your
[2:08:29] hand and say I would love to be an
[2:08:33] Isaiah make my stand for Christ and
[2:08:37] there was I think three people raised
[2:08:38] their hand everybody bowed their head
[2:08:41] close your eyes so private so
[2:08:44] secret then he just goes along a little
[2:08:47] bit and then he Saidi wonder if you that
[2:08:50] raised your hand would stand to their
[2:08:52] feet or come forward come forward I
[2:08:54] think it was
[2:08:56] Hallelujah and do you know that there
[2:08:58] was only
[2:08:59] one man that came forward and brother
[2:09:03] bham said let him be another
[2:09:05] Isaiah out of the whole
[2:09:08] service so brother brandham having the
[2:09:10] gift that he did and brother John don't
[2:09:12] have this gift but he started to go
[2:09:15] right down the line and call out
[2:09:17] people's needs you're situation your
[2:09:19] name and you there and you there and
[2:09:22] this is what it is and you can hear it
[2:09:24] visibly people
[2:09:28] screaming I think it was I'm just
[2:09:31] forgetting right now from nine or 13
[2:09:34] cases he said their name their address
[2:09:37] what their need was then he said now who
[2:09:40] would like to
[2:09:43] come now who believes the presence of
[2:09:46] the Lord and the altars just packed just
[2:09:49] packed up and down and my a lot of us
[2:09:53] would have said praise God we had a
[2:09:56] meeting and you know what brother
[2:09:57] brandham said it's on tape he said you
[2:10:00] have done the worst thing you could have
[2:10:03] ever done he said you should have
[2:10:05] responded to the
[2:10:07] word you responded to the gift of your
[2:10:11] heart being expressed or your need or
[2:10:13] your address your neighbor knows your
[2:10:16] address on the doctor you visited that
[2:10:19] told you you have a certain condition
[2:10:22] knows your condition yeah all
[2:10:25] right the people weren't honest they
[2:10:29] weren't responding to the word they
[2:10:31] weren't responding to Holy Ghost
[2:10:33] Ministry and it's the same
[2:10:36] today we do the same call and maybe
[2:10:39] three raise their hand and we say oh do
[2:10:41] you need prayer and maybe three come
[2:10:43] forward one come forward I don't know
[2:10:46] maybe we okay and the holy spirit is
[2:10:48] just moving moving wants to do something
[2:10:51] wants people to be touched delivered set
[2:10:55] free then my some another gift another
[2:10:58] brother come and there'd be altars
[2:11:00] packed out and all up and down the
[2:11:02] aisles and I I've been in meetings where
[2:11:05] Almost 100% of the people is at the
[2:11:07] altar yeah I preached in New Zealand one
[2:11:11] time this was a young people's meeting
[2:11:13] and it was in a sheep uh Barn I think my
[2:11:17] wife was there I think it was our
[2:11:19] honeymoon it was and we preached a
[2:11:22] message and I think almost every single
[2:11:25] young person was either on their face at
[2:11:27] the altar crying out to God we would say
[2:11:30] my we had a meeting brother we had a
[2:11:34] meeting glory to God but do you know if
[2:11:36] brother Brandon was here and that same
[2:11:38] service played out I wonder how many of
[2:11:41] us would have enough courage to say did
[2:11:43] they respond to the
[2:11:45] word did they respond because their
[2:11:47] friend came and you know that whole row
[2:11:49] of girls came up it has to be God so I'm
[2:11:51] just following out was it the word
[2:11:54] on I wonder how many of us would feel
[2:11:57] like that preacher that said you've done
[2:11:59] the worst thing you could have done
[2:12:01] would say what a rebuke God was doing
[2:12:04] things it was so wonderful no it was a
[2:12:07] prophet being honest those people had
[2:12:11] not responded to the word and they got
[2:12:13] correction for it I say God don't let me
[2:12:16] be that way if you're going to deal with
[2:12:18] my heart I don't care if there's
[2:12:21] 5,000 300 200 how many's in the building
[2:12:25] tonight it doesn't
[2:12:27] matter there might be five there might
[2:12:30] be 500 or 5,000 in Congo young people's
[2:12:34] meeting 5,000 young people it doesn't
[2:12:39] matter we still have young people issues
[2:12:43] and if we were having couples there
[2:12:44] would be couple issues and if we had a
[2:12:47] 40 plus
[2:12:49] camp and it was just 40 and up I'd be
[2:12:52] there and we wouldn't be talking about
[2:12:54] young people's things we'd be talk well
[2:12:56] issues children but it would be about 40
[2:12:59] and
[2:13:01] up and you'd have to shut down after an
[2:13:03] hour because they'd
[2:13:07] all didn't get our nap today my wife
[2:13:10] asked me coming to church did you get
[2:13:11] any rest I said no I pulled in out here
[2:13:15] and I'm just waiting cuz we got here
[2:13:17] really early
[2:13:18] did you get any arrest today I said no
[2:13:21] she said yeah you're just kind of
[2:13:22] staring out
[2:13:25] there thank you
[2:13:27] baby this message was on my
[2:13:31] heart I said how can we deliver this so
[2:13:34] that there's 100% response to the
[2:13:38] word where the Holy Spirit could say
[2:13:41] they did exactly they responded
[2:13:44] appropriately where there doesn't have
[2:13:46] to be a rebuke
[2:13:48] on the day of Pentecost there was no
[2:13:51] rebuke God came down and sealed them he
[2:13:55] blessed them they came busting out of
[2:13:57] there they were cowards they were
[2:14:00] cussers and swearers and God turned them
[2:14:02] into Power
[2:14:13] houses God turned this group of young
[2:14:15] people into
[2:14:16] powerhouses Hallelujah all of
[2:14:20] this you can do more for God Amen that's
[2:14:24] right for the rest of your life just
[2:14:26] give it to God and let him take care of
[2:14:28] things he'll do more for you and through
[2:14:31] you in five minutes then you'll do in a
[2:14:34] whole
[2:14:36] lifetime stop trying to figure it all
[2:14:39] out none of us have got it all figured
[2:14:41] out including brother Jason Watkins
[2:14:44] Hallelujah he doesn't know everything
[2:14:46] and brother Jason De Mars isn't the most
[2:14:48] wonderful teacher and the best Apostle
[2:14:50] in the
[2:14:52] message I'm not even looking at him cuz
[2:14:55] he's probably looking like this or he's
[2:14:57] probably going like this and brother
[2:14:59] Matthew is a fantastic brother and I
[2:15:01] love him but he's not the best preacher
[2:15:03] in the
[2:15:04] message and neither is Brother John
[2:15:06] Andes we're your most humble
[2:15:09] servants what can we do for you tonight

[2:15:22] deacons people in the nursery people out
[2:15:25] in the fellowship hall they just one
[2:15:29] mind and one Accord they're just saying
[2:15:31] God move among
[2:15:32] us there if there'd be 15 stretchers
[2:15:35] here and cuts we'd all be saying God let
[2:15:39] him get up and walk out of here some of
[2:15:41] you that think the whole world revolves
[2:15:43] around you right now and you got real
[2:15:45] problems you'd be saying God touch that
[2:15:47] sister touch that
[2:15:50] brother we get so selfish I don't want
[2:15:53] to offend anyone but the whole world
[2:15:55] don't revolve around you and we're not
[2:15:58] going to come down to your level and
[2:16:00] start being depressed and mopy and Dopey

[2:28:44] they'd end the service
[2:28:47] you and he started cussing and swearing

[2:33:45] blood dripping between me and
[2:33:51] you there's a
[2:33:58] light my loving sister how many would
[2:34:01] like to talk like that not perverted but
[2:34:04] just the great physician and just the
[2:34:07] manners have you all noticed brother
[2:34:08] brandom talking to people in the prayer
[2:34:10] line excuse me can I say this can I say
[2:34:14] this I'm just going to turn my mic
[2:34:16] microphone off cuz I've got a sister
[2:34:18] here and what I'm
[2:34:21] saying it doesn't need to be
[2:34:23] public all right and if what I said
[2:34:28] about what this brother's been doing it
[2:34:30] would cause Penitentiary offenses some
[2:34:33] of you'd want to kill the man so I'm
[2:34:36] just going to turn off my microphone and
[2:34:38] just talk to our brother about what he
[2:34:40] was doing last Thursday
[2:34:43] night oh you say brother if I knew I'd
[2:34:45] tell the pastor the Deacon I'd get right
[2:34:48] on WhatsApp Instagram and everybody
[2:34:50] would know that's why God hasn't called
[2:34:51] you to
[2:34:54] that that's why you keep losing friends
[2:34:57] cuz you're breaking trust all the time
[2:35:00] can I just tell you something brother
[2:35:01] between me and you sure brother it'll
[2:35:04] stay between me you and
[2:35:06] God and 643 people that you're going to
[2:35:11] you know please pray for brother so and
[2:35:12] so he you think that brother's ever
[2:35:15] going to talk to you
[2:35:17] again I'm asking a
[2:35:19] question if I spent 28 minutes with this
[2:35:22] brother after service and he told me
[2:35:24] what was going on in his and brother
[2:35:26] just can you just keep this in
[2:35:28] confidence and pretty soon brother Jason
[2:35:30] knows brother Jason knows brother
[2:35:32] Matthew knows brother I'm pretty my wife
[2:35:34] knows when I get back to the motel do
[2:35:36] you know that brother up there that was
[2:35:37] sitting on the platform what what what
[2:35:39] he's going through brother do you think
[2:35:41] he would ever talk to me again
[2:35:44] no he would definitely go on vacation
[2:35:46] the next time brother John
[2:35:49] came it's because he lost
[2:35:51] confidence it doesn't mean I I don't
[2:35:54] have the Holy Ghost it means I need to
[2:35:56] grow up and when I say brother this is
[2:35:59] confidence it's
[2:36:00] confidence there's a phrase that's
[2:36:02] called and I'll go to my grave with that
[2:36:05] we do it every day yeah there's things
[2:36:08] that happen in this last week my wife
[2:36:11] knows nothing about yeah in Council and
[2:36:14] us talking with someone and she will
[2:36:16] never know that's how it's supposed to
[2:36:21] be moving
[2:36:24] on brother brandom he he said he said I
[2:36:27] think it was Christ as the mystery he
[2:36:29] said if you all
[2:36:31] knew what the angel of the Lord revealed
[2:36:33] to him it would cause penitentary
[2:36:35] offenses just look that up Penitentiary
[2:36:37] offenses it means people would go out
[2:36:39] want to kill somebody they you'd be
[2:36:41] going to jail for murder because a man
[2:36:44] of God had come to
[2:36:48] maturity did anybody get anything out of
[2:36:50] that be more
[2:36:52] trustworthy and stop putting everybody
[2:36:55] else dirty laundry out there God forgave

[2:49:15] brandham said this he talked about that
[2:49:17] and said they might have been healed
