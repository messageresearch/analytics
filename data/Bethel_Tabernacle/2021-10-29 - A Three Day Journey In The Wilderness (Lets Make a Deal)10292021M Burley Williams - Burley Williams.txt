========================================

amen worthy [Music] is the land [Music] seeded [Music] [Music] high and lifted [Music] [Applause] [Music] worthy is the land [Music] is the land thank you for the cross [Music] thank you for the cross lord thank you for the price [Music] in love you came and gave me [Applause] grace thank you for this love [Music] let's just close eyes and worship him a little bit this morning now all i know is your forgiveness [Music] is [Music] me we are [Music] [Music] [Music] say [Music] worthy is the lamb let's sing worthy is dilemma [Music] [Applause] the land seated on the brawn [Music] uh [Music] jesus [Music] the treasure of heaven [Music] worthy is the land worthy is the land worthy is the land [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] happy to be here man man we're gonna get sister deborah to give us a song this morning let's give her our precious sister a hand man [Music] but just a quick little testimony because i don't know if i can make it through the song without crying and i want you guys to know why um when i was probably about the same age as most of you here i really struggled hard with a lot of just depression and anxiety a lot of mental battles that you know satan plagues all of us and he tries to tell you you're the only one struggling with what you're going through but that's a lie it's not true we all have things we're battling and this song means so much to me because it just tells you that if you're in the middle of a battle like that and satan's telling you that you're worthless and that you need to be alone and you need to hide away just praise him just praise him because demons have to flee when you lift your hands in praise and i i'm not a great singer i'm not anything close to what most of you guys who signed up on our solo sheet are but i hope this song is a blessing to you and if you pick up on the chorus you're more than welcome to join in [Music] my is it never does [Music] that i come to [Music] [Music] and when the painful times [Music] i will praise you all day through and when the enemy should rise and the storms around my life [Music] lifted me [Music] as a gift [Music] sometimes my faith just seems so small [Music] but you always catch me when i fall i'm your [Music] and greatest will praise you again i will praise you all day through and when the enemy should rise and the storms surround my life i will praise you then too sometimes the storm is long and it feels like you're gone and i wonder if i'll make it home and i remember [Music] [Applause] [Music] i will praise you [Music] i will praise you all day through [Music] and the storms surround my [Music] will life you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen that certainly is the truth it's because he lives i can face tomorrow hey man we're going to try to move quick because i know we got uh 11 30. lunch so i got a lot to say so we're going to try to get it going thank you musician let's get a musician at hand you know sometimes you see musicians playing the instruments have you ever noticed sometimes they get their face be moving and get funny looks on their face y'all ever notice about musicians what they mean they're in it then all of a sudden they'll look at one another because they're in it amen praise the lord so i hope you get some frowns on your face when the word go first let me know you in it praise the lord so uh we uh uh while you're standing uh i better just get on into the word i want to read jeremiah 1 we really thank bethel brother matt and brother jason the church for having these meetings the burden upon their heart it's a wonderful thing and we want to thank the tabernacle for these things for the burden that they have i share the same burden with them you know it's good to see everyone and we know some have traveled very far but god bless you i'm thankful i just live about an hour and 15 minutes from here so you're counting my hometown so uh anyway praise the lord so let's go to jeremiah chapter one [Music] and we're gonna go to verse nine then the lord puts forth his hand and touched my mouth and the lord said unto me behold i have put my words in thy mouth see i have this day shut thee over the nations over the kingdoms to root out to pull down and to destroy and to throw down to build and to plant father we just want to thank you for the reading of your word and we just pray that you just come and speak to the hearts of your children we give everything to you father we give you all the glory and praise in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated we uh we just thank god for his grace and mercy you know there's a lot of things may happen rapidly in such a short amount of time many events have taken place you see a lot of things going around the message of the hour like brother jason was ministering last night people falling away those things are also a part of prophecy those things has to happen but i trust and pray this morning i don't know what state you are in life or what you're going through but i do know one thing you have to be determined that yourself that is everybody wants to fall in this message you want you have to have that determination i'm not going to fall i'm going to press on regardless what come you have to be persuaded is that right you know the bible says that we're supposed to be a peculiar people or royal priesthood how many you believe that we want to be a peculiar people but not a familiar people to the world hey man we want to be different they'll see a different characteristic in us and i was just thinking about that word peculiar that word peculiar it can be negative and it can also be positive amen when somebody is kind of living a different type of life that's a you know what i'm talking about peculiar things they're doing things contrary to nature that's a peculiar person amen but we want to be the right type of peculiar people it means that someone has a specific specific characteristic different from common people and that's the way we're supposed to be can we say man we are the bride of jesus christ and you know we got some things that we just want to kind of deal with this morning and uh but the reason why i read jeremiah in the beginning because uh is i read it for a purpose um i want you to notice what he says in verse 10 he called jeremiah for a purpose and it says he said i put thee over the nations over the kingdoms and then he put a purpose where i put you there to root out pull down and destroy and to throw down now that don't mean jeremiah was going to go down there and fight people physically amen but he went and done all those things by the word but i want you to notice how god specifically said things it's talking about root out pull down and destroy and throw down but the last two parts is to build and plant see other words he wanted jeremiah to root out whatever needs to be rooted out throw down whatever need to be thrown down get rid of it but not leave it in that shape but build and plant see that's how god does things hey man so you might hear some things and during the services that might sound a little harsh uh rebuking or whatever it is don't get mad at the preacher that's god rooting out some things amen amen because what god want to do is something in your life that don't need to be there and it's hindering god wanted to want it to be pulled out thrown down amen but the main thing at the ending of it god want to build you he want to plant something in you so you can start building you can we say praise the lord so that's why services every service is different amen sometimes god's exhort but sometimes before an exaltation he had to tear some things down didn't give an exhortation amen that's the same as discipline as a parent amen we correct our children but the main thing when you correct somebody don't let them stay in a state that they're lost and they're doomed there's no hope for them amen correct yes but let them know that you're better than that you can be better than that there is hope but sometimes you have to address certain things amen so that people know they need to press on we are the bride of jesus christ can we say man so i wanted to read that scripture first now uh let me tell you something young people uh catch the meaning of the message what is it that's the reality of it we're not just a normal church-going people living any kind of life and say oh i'm saved i'm a religious no we've been called to be live a higher standard than denominational lives can we say praise the lord and i'm so thankful for that because god called us a peculiar people we're supposed to be different but what's happening in this day and time because of the internet and all the social media and stuff like that you can get the whole world right in your phone and don't realize the influences that come from those things thank you brother so we want to just talk about a few things but my main purpose this morning i just want to rip the hide off the devil that's what i'm interested in i like to see people free praise the lord let me tell you something this message it came not to put you in bondage it came to set you free the bible said the commandments of god is not grievous so don't look at the message i can't do this i can't go ahead i can't have that you're looking the wrong way that's the devil he makes you want to get you to look that way but that's not what it's all about it's about seeing you set free being totally delivered god did not preach us a message halfway delivered he preached a message total deliverance and i believe that's what god wants us to be totally delivered can we say man how many of you know what all how many you know what almost saved means almost say mean totally lost huh that's my brother jason like he was talking about this uh last night about being saved god don't want you to be a halfway christian he wants you to be a whole christian all the way god wants your mind your body your soul he wants it all he don't want second place he wants first place can we say praise the lord how many do you believe that you're eagles this morning god identify us as eagles can we say praise the lord but you know let me tell you something about eagles they don't fly in groups when eagles fly they fly alone or you'll see two if you see two is him and his wife they don't fly in groups they don't need groups to survive come on now praise the lord now we're here but eagles eat in groups they'll come down and eat in groups where after they eat they go their separate ways so i want to let you know one thing when you leave this service you got to be still persuaded yourself i can serve god with the group without a group i can serve god that's the way it has to be amen because if you get into a place if you get into a place god do something for you now but you ain't got a revelation of satan in your soul i'ma tell you what's gonna happen to you when you start going through your hard times and things ain't going right you're gonna say huh i guess i better wait for the next camp to get revived again don't let that spirit get on you like that friends because then you'll just be a camp jumper waiting for the next camp to get revived no no no you got to be determined amen i'm going to serve god if i don't go to a camp amen if i got to be by myself i'm going to serve him that's the way it has to be praise the lord so it's not group effort praise the lord all right let's just get into the message right now let's uh i want to turn to luke chapter 4. it's good to hear some of you flipping your bibles that's good because now you know we do it all on the phones hey man but i'm gonna tell you don't you gotta i got my ipad that's fine but i like to hear them bibles flip because sometimes we get so much into the ipads and iphone people think the pillow of fire in the church hey the church glowing up because people don't want to use the bible no get used to them pages luke chapter 4 verse 1 and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit in the wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god command the stone that it be made bread and jesus answered him it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god but the devil taking him up in a high mountain showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time verse 6 and the devil said to him i just want you to listen to this and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for it is delivered unto me and to whomsoever will i give it i give it if thou therefore worship me they all shall be dying and jesus answered and said to him get me behind me satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve i'm not going to read all the rest of this but uh i want to go to the book of exodus exodus chapter five three i'm sorry i wanted to minister this morning a three-day journey in the wilderness and my subtitle is let's make a deal let's make a deal you notice what we read in the temptation of jesus the prophet of god called it his own personal temptations jesus had personal temptations himself and this is what the devil was dealing with him so you and i each one of us something that might tempt somebody else might not tempt you but the devil knows exactly how to tempt you the devil know exactly what you would be interested in he will not keep you in something you're not interested in it'll be something you're interested in or struggling with that's what the devil will use but what he likes to do how many of you know the devil likes to make deals that's exactly what he was doing to jesus he said i'll give you all of this the power and the glory of them but we have to make the deal and the deal was just worship me serve me i'll give you all of this see the devil like to make deals and i'm here to tell you you got to be able to catch when the devil is trying to make a deal with you deserve it and then you can tell him no deal can we say praise the lord so just follow along with me now in exodus chapter 3 verse 13 and moses said unto god behold when i come into the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers has sent me unto you they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus i say unto the children of israel i am have sent me unto you and god said more unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord god are your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob have sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my memorial into all generations god said i want that word i am to be known this is the memorial through all generation and i am me it's present right now present ten i am i am amen when you believe god for something don't believe for tomorrow believe right now if you need deliverance you say i'm gonna be not i ain't gonna wait till tomorrow to get deliverance i'm gonna get delivered right now don't push it off amen now he says in verse 18 he said they shall hearken to divorce and thou shalt come and the elders of israel unto the king of egypt you shall say unto him the lord god of the hebrews had met with us and now let us go we beseech thee three days journey in the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god see that's moses message three days journey in the wilderness so that we could sacrifice to our god and moses never left that message he kept repeating that to pharaoh amen are you with me now let's go to exodus chapter 5. we want to go to verse 1. and afterwards moses and aaron went in told pharaoh just said let the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness moses just repeating what god said he was determined he was stuck on this message he wasn't going to change it for nobody you and i have to be the same way i am determined this message is true can we say it ma'am and i'm not going to compromise and i'm not going to change for nobody verse 2 pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to let israel go i know not the lord neither will i let israel go that's pretty bold that's pretty bold but that's okay now verse three and they said the god of the hebrews had met with us let us go we pray thee three days journey in the desert see going back three days journey in the desert and sacrifice them to the lord our god lest he fall upon us with presence of the sword and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do you moses and aaron let the people go from their works get you unto your burdens pharaoh said behold the people of the land are now many and you make them rest from your burden see that's the spirit of egypt they just want you to be burdened all the time don't want you to have no freedom but burden sin is a burden unconfessed sin is a burden because it'll plague your mind it'll play thinking and it'll just wait but god when god sets you free it's no burden amen you know you burdens all of you do all of us do you know when you do something wrong your mom and daddy don't know about it but you know you did it wrong that's a burden because the brother kneel you wondering when are they ever going to find out what i did that's the burden and the burden won't leave until you get right with them then the burden leaves that's the same thing with god when john introduced jesus christ he said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world so if he came to take us take them away from us what makes us think we can live and sin and then be right with him no he came to take them away so we can be delivered all right let's just go on now i want you to now go to exodus chapter 8. when the lord wants to do something in your life now i know we have some here you're probably born you're born again some maybe not i understand those things in different uh categories but i'm trusting that those that are born again when you lead the service you can even be more renewed and those here if you're not born again you'll be born again before you leave that's the purpose the main thing is for you to be helped praise the lord but i want to show you something how the devil works whenever god is moving upon you dealing with your heart do you think the devil is just going to leave you alone he's not he's going to start immediately start making plans how he can deceive you and keep you trapped amen remember even when jesus rebuked satan the bible says the devil left jesus for a season that means he ain't giving up even on jesus other words he said hey you would be pretty good this time i just got to think of another way to get you and that's the same thing he'll do with you we know that you don't caught on to something that he's doing the devil will pull back but then he'll start going another way to try to get you that you're not looking for i'm so thankful for the holy ghost friends because every time the devil makes a move the holy ghost will point him right out and let him know what's going on that's why it's important in this time to be born again the holy ghost will lead you and will guide you into all truth praise the lord so now pharaoh we're here in exodus chapter eight goddamn brought plagues a lot of things that you've been dropping on egypt cause the god was letting the devil know you're gonna let my people go regardless amen but god wanted the egyptians to know that he is the real god so the bible said he judged the gods of egypt god wanted the egyptian to know your god is nothing i am the lord i control everything i am over everything so pharaoh knowing that moses is not going to change his message not going to get off of it pharaoh had to change his tactics and i'm going to show you the very way his tactics has changed it's the same thing that will do to you praise the lord notice verse eight pharaoh called for moses and aaron said and treat the lord that he may take away frogs from me and from my people and i will let the people go that they may sacrifice unto the lord and moses said it to pharaoh glory over me when shall i treat thee in thy service and for thy people to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses and they may remain in the river only he said tomorrow and he said be it according to thy word now let's just skip down i want to go down to verse 15. but when pharaoh saw that there was respite he heartened his heart and he could not unto them as the lord had said now we know after the we're going to skip a lot for time's sake that's when god don't suck the flies and so forth plague after plague now pharaoh is getting to a point this moses just ain't going to stop until they get out of here until they can go worship their lord he said but i got to be crafty about this because you got to remember pharaoh did not want to let these israelites go it's the same as the devil he don't want you to see be free that's just purpose he don't want you to be free so he'll have to work by the way of deception amen now pharaoh let's jump down to verse 25. pharaoh realized i can't stop this guy he said but i got to make some deals i need to start making deals with moses that's exactly what's going to happen listen to what he says pharaoh called to moses and aaron and said go sacrifice to your god look how he twisted it in the land but that's not what moses said moses said we're going to go a three-day journey in the wilderness so now look at the deception of pharaoh he said okay go on sacrifice that's fine that's what you want to do sacrifice to your lord but in the land now watch out he's trying to make a deal moses said it is not me so to do for shall we sacrifice the abortion of the egyptians to the lord our god you say now brother berlin what that got to do with me it has a lot to do with us the devil does the exact same thing other words he telling moses you go ahead and worship sacrifice to your lord but stay in egypt he'll try to make that same deal with you when god starts dealing with your heart you say i want to serve the lord now amen god don't touch me now now i want to serve the lord but the devil will come that's good you in church but it's okay to still do worldly things it's okay to still have your egyptian habits you're going to church now he's trying to make a deal with you come on now he's pretty crafty hey man if you're just going to come to church have a good sermon and don't want to change you've always gone down to the baptist church friends you might even go ahead and be a presbyterian or something but that's not what this message called for you are the church it's not the building you are the church god want to change you so he said sacrifice in the land praise the lord moses said no no no no no no we're going to worship god egypt ain't going to have nothing to do with it you got to be the exact same way if i'm going to serve god i'm doing away with my egyptian past life it's over with hey amen let's keep going go with me the verse now watch verse 28. now let's just keep reading verse 27 he said we will go three days journey in the wilderness sacrifice to the lord our god as he shall commanded us see moses just won't stop he stayed right on his message now pharaoh he's watching moses he said hmm let me change my tactic a little bit more now listen to what he said pharaoh said i will let you go that you may sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness listen what he said only you shall not go very far away that's the devil right there see now he said okay not in the land go in the wilderness but don't go very far away same thing the devil dude make a deal okay okay i see now you you you want to serve the lord you don't want your egyptian habits okay okay now the devil will tell you keep going to church but just don't keep going too far don't let your experience get too deep with the lord don't go far away amen why he don't want them to go very far away the reason why the egyptians was lazy the israelites done everything for them when they need them to do something they call them right so moses pharaoh realized if they go too far away when we need something done hey we ain't going to be able to get reached to them so don't go far away that's why the devil say go to church but keep your habits when i want you to lust i want to make sure you're not too far away where i can still use you what i want you to hate i want you to see you ain't went too far i can use hatred i can use certain things in your life if you don't go too far away from me when i want to anoint you and use you but you got to let the devil know nope i'm going far away from you as possible i'm getting far away from this world as possible i don't want to have nothing to do with it let's make a deal verse 29 moses said behold i go out from thee and i will intrigue the lord that the swarms of the flies may depart from pharaoh from his service and from his people tomorrow now moses was catching everything listen to what he said let not pharaoh deal deceitfully anymore see pharaoh changed from his boldness i don't know the lord neither are going to let you go but when he seen god kept bringing the plagues and he began to see that moses wasn't going to change he had to start working with deceit and that's what the devil would try to do to you he would try to make he he don't mind you being religious don't mind you going to church satan literally don't mind you singing he don't mind you what he'll my father he'll stand right beside you in worship he do not mind but want to do keep you from being born again full of the holy spirit he just want to keep you from that because he knows once they get that i lost praise the lord so he got to make deals with you all right now just keep going don't deal deceitfully any more let's go to verse 27 exodus chapter 9 though exodus 9 27 pharaoh sent call from moses and aaron and saying unto them i have sinned this time praise the lord even he realized i'm a sinner he said the lord is righteous and i my people are wicked and treat the lord for it is enough that there'll be no more mighty thunderings in hell and i will let you go and you shall stay no longer let me tell you something friends i'm gonna show you how the devil work you can come to service after service after service and god be dealing with you and you know that he's dealing with you the devil's that's going to still sit there get more deceitful to stop you from going on further now what i'm speaking to you i'm kind of speaking you know it kind of sounds like i'm saying nobody got the holy ghost no that's not what i'm saying i'm just showing you steps how the devil will try to make deals because even you can be full of the holy spirit he still could try to make deals with you didn't he do that that's what he did to our lord so they was going to keep that balance now for those that are trying to go farther on with the lord and you know you're not born again i just want to show you tricks of the devil to try to stop you from getting there verse 29 and moses said unto them as soon as i'm going out of the city i will spread forth my hands and the lord the thunder shall cease neither shall there be any more hell now now i want to skip that i just read that just showing that he between exodus 9 to exodus 10 things happened to the cattle boys pestilence rain grievous hell god still dropping these things but that's in between revelation exodus 9 and 10. now i want to go to exodus chapter 10. pharaoh's just making deals that's what he's doing so after these things don't happen with the locusts look at exodus 10 8 it says moses and aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them go serve the lord your god watch this watch them go go but who are they shall go he asked in a question he already know the answer to because moses already told him now listen to what moses said moses said we will go with our young with our own with our sons with our daughters with our flocks with our herbs we will will we go for we must hold a feast unto the lord now watch around all of this happening he let him know moses let him know who i was going to go now watch how religious this devil gets now listen what he said verse 10 he said until let the lord be so with you but in the beginning he said i don't know this lord who i don't know but now he's saying god bless you let the lord be with you let him be with you you see every time somebody talk to you about the lord that don't mean they are right with the lord that could be deceit oh come on now praise the lord i'ma tell you we always preaching we will we say get married in the message that's kind of not true it kind of need to be a little more balanced on that don't marry them because they're in the message you marry them make sure the message is in them not just because they're in a message church you make sure that message is in is that right cause the devil can get you on that too well i like this boy i know he ain't got the holy ghost and i ain't either but we're in a message church no no don't work like that praise the lord then you got the other side well i'm in the message and and i have the holy spirit and i feel wrong relationship with the lord but the boys in the message they're so immature but this song over there in the pentecostal church and he's a real mature young man and i think the lord is leading me that way i don't think he is oh this this sister's oh she just dressed right and uh and she don't wear oh she's just perfect she talks about the words she talks about the lord i know she said she's a whole witness i understand all of that but when i what she just write i can marry her and then she'll get converted to the message that ain't the way it works huh ain't how it works all right let's make a deal well it really ain't no boys in my church so uh in high school there's some good boys in church i know they're not in church but but he likes me he respects my when he see my mom them he waves his hand he's such a respectful i think he's a pretty good boy that's just making the devil just want to make a deal with you oh that was good oh your brother might have a friend that's a whirly boy you say well he's a whirly boy i know that but he's my brother's friend and my brother won't let nobody hurt me cause my brother's gonna watch over me so what's wrong with that there's a lot wrong with that i'm getting ahead of myself let me just kind of speak for a minute here listen he get religious now listen to what he says he said let the lord be so with you as i will let you go what's the choice and your little ones look to it forever be for you you know what he's doing now he's targeting the young people otherwise he's telling moses okay you them oh and y'all can go y'all electronic you ain't gonna leave the message just go but the little children listen what he said let's read it again he says now let the lord i'm sorry verse 10. he said now listen i want to read this again to get the emphasis he said unto them let the lord be so with you and as i will let you go your little ones look to it for evil is before you and then he said not so this man is religious what he's actually saying moses if you want to go go ahead but it's going to be evil before you it's all kind of dangerous out there in that desert you're gonna drag them little children out there and all the heat not so moses i ain't gonna let you do it moses y'all can go but leave me the children what is that devil trying to do he want to get the parents away from the children so he can have the children by himself so he can indoctrinate them that's what the devil try to do to you separate you from your parents you don't need your parents they don't understand you you're young you don't need to hear all this message about brother brown you don't need to hear all this he want to pull you away from that you're young you need to live your own life he's trying to target the little ones but i'm here to tell you friends there's some ministers here tonight we ain't gonna forget the little ones we ain't gonna forget the children that's what this meeting is all about because we have not forgotten amen you see the devil try to bring those things even in parent's mind let's make a deal look you're going to serve the lord go ahead on don't put that pressure on your children they make their own decision you dragging your children in this message and you telling

where you at you can't hide it you know what thank god for the holy ghost some of you know how to act right you know how to say the right thing knowing you're wrong but you cannot deceive the holy

you hello if you get a man by what you put out outwardly when your life changed having babies and stuff with all that change he going to leave you because he married you for outward appearance but if he got a hold he got the holy ghost you got the holy ghost you'll know it'll be just right praise the lord but how do you know he got it you ain't got it you need to have it yourself your first marriage should be to jesus christ that's your first marriage right there you got to be able to walk along with god by yourself by completely by yourself overcoming your youthful loss then you're ready for marriage huh if you still got all the habits in your life all this fornication pornography all of that in your life forget about talking about a book to a boy forget about talking to a girl you're not right you're not even ready starts in you first another thing about the eagle i love when a female knows that a male is liking her he just flying around let's start sticking out she's just looking at me he won't impress him away she's looking at the wings oh look at them boy but you know what she does it's a ritual before a female eagle be with the male she'll go pick up a stick or she'll pick up a stone she'll fly high as she can go and she'll just drop it he'll have to catch that stick of that stone before it hit the ground she would not be with him the purpose of it is when she trains her babies how to fly she put them on her back she flips upside down and shake them off she knows he can't pick up that stick he can't pick up that stone he gonna let all her babies drop so sister when that big old eagle come flying around you quote books look at he dressed just right you know what you need to do drop some word on him if he catching that word he said keep on flying buddy just keep on going come on man hey man so you can't be a husband to me when you're like a young man what you're actually saying this is the man willing now to trust to lead me spiritually leave me

guide you hello hey you do whatever your pastor tell you to do i got rules i got a young girl sitting in my church right dang that right rachel i got rules praise the lord i don't care who you are fella you want to like a a young girl some man's daughter if you can't go face that man and talk to that man wrong with you if you got a bypass get on all this texting see i'm the one that was preaching i'm a little old-fashioned i don't believe bars and girls should text oh that's a little hard i know i'm just telling you what i believe cause in your texting you're creating relationships with your words it could just start with just a little text how you doing today i'm fine i've been praying for you oh thank you then i'm saying he's a prayer warrior what a husband for me and he got something totally else on his mind ain't nothing wrong with a little text acts ease praise the lord oh man but man i ain't got enough time bro but we'll keep back to the scripture i want you to notice verse 10 he said let the lord be so with you and i'll let you go and your little ones and look to it for evil is before you let's go down to verse 12. and the lord said unto moses stretch out thy hand over the land of egypt for locusts that they may come upon the land of egypt and eat every earth of the land even all that have the hell hath left now i want to jump down to verse 24. i hope you catch this satan keep trying to make deals i mean through pharaoh now watch when you see that moses ain't going to lead the little children he ain't going to stay in the land he's going to go far away when he sees that he can't keep him he's still got to keep changing strategies and the devil will do the same thing with you he'll do the same thing with me he'll change strategies so look at what he said verse 24 pharaoh called to moses and said go share the lord he just won't give up he said only let your flocks and your herbs be staid let your little ones also go with you see god just put a good whipping on him with them locust first just take them too just take them but leave your flocks see that's the same thing now let's just keep reading verse 25 moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god verse 26 our cattle also shall go with us there shall not a huff be hoof be left behind now notice now the devil won't rosin in the leaves go out there in the wilderness but with no sacrifice there's no i'm gonna tell you something friend that's why you got to study this message you the message was plainly and tell you exactly what calvary is for why christ died for you god don't want you to be sitting in the message with a bunch of knowledge but not recognizing what he does for you on calvary he wanted them to leave without a sacrifice you have to stay in this word yourself i can't make you steady your pastor can't make you study but you gotta have a want to to lay it out moses said we ain't going to leave a hoof think about that not people left out of egypt for it to be too over to the battle had to be yeah and moses telling us man we ain't gonna leave a hoof now ferguson falls really man i'm letting you go and you're going to tell me with all that you got you ain't going to leave a hoof mother said nope because everything that belongs to god going you got to be the exact same way satan i ain't leaving you nothing everything about me i'm gonna give it to god i ain't leaving you nothing i'm going all of the way you got to have that same determination [Applause] that's right let's make a deal you see that three-day journey in the wilderness when god deals with your heart he's dealing with you you still can be living in sin filter all and stuff still in your life but because you responded to him calling you that puts you in a justified state you're coming to church yeah you got them habits but you don't want them don't stop there the devil says see you're in church no no he said no no to satan the things i got in my life i don't want him there so then you got to go to the next step the sanctification so now as you keep coming to church keep coming to church hearing the word what's going to happen as you're listening to the word cleansing start taking place in your life then you begin to realize i don't want to do that no more i don't i can't even think like that no more my thinking is different my ways is different i want to dress diff i want to act different god's just cleansing you up that's just two stages can we say amen but if you keep pressing on somewhere i don't win everybody is different somewhere down the line if you just keep pressing on god will fill you with himself there goes your three days journey in that wilderness but it's not gonna be a witness it's a journey though are you with me but you got to be like moses the was keep trying him to stop from taking the three-day journey but moses was determined we're going all the way you'll have to be the exact same way give me say praise the lord i just got a few more minutes but abandon says actually when goliath came down to the children of israel he said that's what goliath said let's make a deal let me remember the story you remember saul in the israelite was on top of a mountain the philistine was on top of a mountain you remember brother jason was talking about the greatest battle fought in the mind he that's that's the scripture the prophet used in that message but down in the valley where they meet that's where the battle was going to take place so your mind is that valley but you notice now uh mo saw them on the mountain philistines on the mountain but you know we always talk about mountaintop experiences we all happy and so forth sawn it was on the mountain but they wasn't having a mountaintop experience they were defeated goliath defeated the israelites without throwing a weapon didn't shoot no boat they didn't throw no spear but saw them was on top of a mountain defeated how did he defeat them with words they didn't swing nothing at them words that's why the greatest battle is fought in the mind when the devil starts trying to want to plug your mind you got to know how to rebuke that devil just like jesus did it is written push those thoughts away get rid of them don't let him nest and just keep meditating upon him then you're going to manifest it that's right but all of that talking he did let's make a deal what's the deal if we beat you you serve us but if you beat us we'll serve you it's all about serving you that's what the devil is all about want god people to serve him that's what it's all about and saw them was defeated until one came here comes david amen you know what david was david was a deal breaker amen david let them know no deal you got to be the exact same way when the devil want to bring something to you whether it's a boy whether it's a girl whether it's your fashion what if it's moving what is it music you gotta [Applause] you got to be the deal breaker when the devil want to make a deal with you you'll be the deal breaker and i was telling you to take the word of god and you can do it amen praise the lord this is where it has to be no deal i'm trying to rush a lot of stuff here but i think you got the point this this put me teaching in the morning i'm trying my best i'm not a teacher but i'm trying that you know that so you got evangelists sitting over there that evangel anointing kind of hit me make me wanna i'm trying to slow it down a little bit it's kind of hard praise the lord but i want to tell you young people let me back up here let me throw a few more things in here and then we'll let you go there's all kinds of deals that the devil can give it's a shame sometimes the devil wants you to do that i'm you of things that you doing or done done or dealing with but i'm here to tell you this never break a relationship with your parents that you can't talk to him never break a relationship pastor you can't talk to him because when you're not strong yourself to be able to deal with things the devil's going to make deals with you just tell you you okay you're dealing with it but sometimes you need somebody to talk to and there's nobody better than your parents your pastor because we're here to help a lot of times yeah i like to put it to you like this when you are ashamed of the way that you've been living that's good it's actually good when you're ashamed that lets you know there's still conviction there but when you're not ashamed whatever whatever that's bad friends the most gracious thing god could ever do to a human being and he done the prophet god said he's only obligated to deal with you one time and he don't have to do it again he said that he dealt with cain one time came refused he never dealt with him again but god is so gracious he keep calling he keep knocking he keep knocking but you know what you'll have to respond go nothing you will have to respond i don't have to shout to preach to you and say i'm anointed i don't you don't have to do that it's different types of service it can be simple talking just like this too god can deal with your heart let me tell you something friend i believe god here at this count and all you came on your own accord i just sit back listening to the singing that's that's awesome yeah i just really feel the presence of the lord that's good so you got a wonderful setup and then the word comes forth it's all is for the purpose for god to break change when paul and silas was in prison you know a earthquake most time we talk about earthquake we speak of destruction buildings falling this happening distant taking place but you remember the story when paul and saying god the bible said the foundation of the prison it was a great earthquake and the foundation of the prison was shaken but what you and i would think about because usually when an earthquake comes it comes to destroy things but this was a specially designed earthquake sent straight from god because when the prison though when it when the prison foundation shook that earthquake was designed to open doors and then they wake up what happened what happened then all the prisoners looked whoa doors and all of that happened because the tuba prison wasn't in them when they started off singing other prisoners were probably over there really really here we are locked up in them idiots up there singing songs really we don't want to hear all of that but they just kept on singing kept on singing amen like sometimes people being worship serving oh they singing another special oh come on get it over with man come on uh-huh but as they begin to sing that's why i like it when you can get one person and start praising and they just stay there stay there and start affecting other people you can't let nobody stop your praise can we say man come on now when god tell you to praise start praising it's gonna help somebody else because in their praise in their worship it caused doors to be open for somebody else but here's the thing when the door was open it was their choice to walk out god opened the doors but he didn't make him walk out was standing right there all they have to do now is just walk out so i'm gonna tell you that's why it's important for a believer you and me to know where our position is in the body of christ because god want to use you to help somebody else that's why you got to find your place notice often god said in the message of adoption you don't just pop in them places you don't pop in a position you're predestinated for it god got every one of you here for a reason talk about the things they went to youth camp they've done wrong they've done all kind of things but you know what they came out right but i'm not here to tell you keep doing wrong to come out right no get right and stay right that might not be the past that's for you because i'm not here to preach to you young people a permissive willed message i'm preaching to you a perfect will message when you don't grow it up in the message heard all of the truth you know some people come into message lives messed up you might see the pastor deal with them a different way that got nothing to do with you they came in messed up hello situation courage all kind of baggage they be dealt with the same way you cannot take that right one pastor why can't you deal with me like that no no no it's different for you cause you're called to a more higher college because you know what truth is are you with me i better quit i just i got i quit bro i got a whole bunch right here but i know some of you probably your stomach growling you're hungry but but god bless you but i just want to say this i love you i love you with all of my heart but young people don't leave this camp don't even leave the day without something that took place in your life i can give you incidents after incidents of things that's happening but it don't matter what's happening right now is god trying to deal with you pull you closer to him this is the now right now so friends even on the campground please do me a favor don't form a denomination on the campground he said what do you mean by that oh yeah you can form your little denomination some of you start clicking up and just because somebody there might be a little different for you you don't want them in your little clique don't do that let's be brothers and sisters on this campground [Applause] be around somebody that's positive not negative a statement was made to me an individual told me said i want my children to hang around other struggling children so they can relate i said no no no no struggle plus struggle equals what struggle to know you want your child to hang around a child that don't overcame that's what you need to do hang around somebody that don't overcame because they probably don't been through something you don't went through there you got something struggling and you struggling and y'all just talking to each other all they're gonna be yeah i'm going through this too yeah me too man it's pretty hard yeah it really really is rough all right see you in service tomorrow both of you still walk away strugglers but if you could somebody they want to talk about the word encourage you until you can get to a place in your own life somebody with the word do that on this camp cause i'm saying this i mean i can't tell you how many camps i don't preach and camp out the camp i see clicks and groups and groups and groups they're easy to identify first day on the camp you don't know what's what what but as the days go by you better be identify the groups in other words you got to call it the hair group always start putting their hair a certain way then you can point them all out because they're going to because a little girl that they look up to got a little early spirit on her seem to be popular say i want to hang around the popular way and then you start fixing your hair to fit in with the hair group oh yeah that's the influence then the cool guy group the guy walking around the camp every eye on him usually got a bunch of grease in the head you can fry a chicken with it huh and the girls just said oh then the other little boy he's cool if he don't get right where he going ain't cool but you want to get in that little group the cool boy group and hang around walking what's that and then all the girls the popular hair girl hair group look at the cool boy group he's looking at you he looking at me i'm here to let you know he looking at all of you cause he ain't no good [Applause] this ain't no good but can you discern those things [Applause] it's the question can you pick it up discern those things i just said one more when i close i use my own son i'm glad he ain't here i was at a camp one time and i was standing in a ministry building i just so happened it was a window right there where i could see the kids playing i just happened to look out the window it was my own son i seen him walking and then i happened to look behind him there's a little flock of girls right behind him i said well look at that and of course he was like i eased out the door when i came out and the reason why they was following him because their spirits was in agreement [Music] and i asked him he said you know when the bars with you you know hanging right at you yo what's up dog what's up my man and that mom said come here ma'am so you got to act a certain way in front of the group huh somebody see me i said what's up he said that's what's going on he said he already knew what the deal was daddy they followed me he said i told them that you know we can't be doing this you know i told him i said no you did he said yes i did i said you said it but you didn't tell them that's because if you told them what an anointing behind it they won't keep following you you got to say no no deal stop following me this is not right i'm not ready you're not ready because they wouldn't stop but no cause you like it huh you see young fellow don't play with girls feelings i resent that don't do it some of you walk around oh man you know roosters they like to be in the hen y'all with a bunch of hens huh come on you ever seen the rooster in them here what did they do brother they let you know i own this hen yard i own this yard it's mine right see you get some on camp like that walking around the camp and in the hands i just want to let you know something rooster i'm the farmer with the pig fork and i stick it in the head rooster that's right that's right it's wrong amen don't play nobody's emotions if you're an age you got the holy ghost and you want a relationship i think you're in the right place some people say no no no no it's okay they are age they know where they are with the lord ain't nothing wrong coming to a campground lord i want a husband i want a wife you know that lord is it on the count are they there i'd rather for them to come here hoping that and go looking for something out there in that world this is a good thing to have counts and it's a shame some preachers don't even agree with camps and the ones that i know they don't agree with them they got no youth in their church because they keep them to themselves here for a purpose this is a wonderful thing because i got breath in my life i get enough chance to preach another camp or barely be right there if i be 99 years old with a cane in my hand somebody asked me to preach that account i'll take that cane right at the pulpit and i'll keep on preaching them i will amen god bless you [Applause] how many appreciate the word hallelujah amen i love brother burley i love his ministry no preachers are different different ministries are different you know i i thought i'd use an analogy brother burley you know there's a there's there's i like to see a you know good boxing match and they use gloves when they box so there's also a kind of fight and they don't hardly use any gloves at all brother burley don't use any gloves at all so on the fights with they don't use gloves there's a lot more knockouts brother tell you what that kind of preaching will knock the devil flat out i believe the devil got knocked out this morning amen hallelujah let's all stand to our feet appreciate that brother burley amen we got some announcements
