[0:00] let's all stand and have a word of
[0:01] prayer
[0:05] dear lord we want to
[0:06] thank you for this opportunity to come
[0:08] and
[0:09] speak your word and ask that you would
[0:11] use me anoint my lips that i would be
[0:12] able to get out of the way and that
[0:13] you'd be able to speak through me and
[0:15] give the people something that they
[0:16] would be able to use in these in dark
[0:18] times that they would be hone their
[0:20] swords and and become more and more like
[0:23] you today than more than they were
[0:24] yesterday and that they would use these
[0:25] things to become more like you tomorrow
[0:28] to see your word for our day we ask
[0:29] these things in jesus name amen
[0:32] so i want to um while we're standing i
[0:34] want to turn to
[0:36] um
[0:37] matthew 27.
[0:46] and we're gonna turn to verse
[0:48] six uh
[0:50] actually let's see
[0:52] um
[0:54] let's go to verse 12.
[0:59] says um
[1:00] and when he was accused of the chief
[1:02] priests and elders he answered nothing
[1:05] then said pilate unto him hearst thou
[1:07] not uh not how many things they witness
[1:10] against thee and he answered
[1:14] i lost my place and he answered him to
[1:16] never a word in so much that the
[1:18] governor marveled greatly now at that
[1:20] feast the governor was want to release
[1:22] unto the people a prisoner
[1:25] whom they would and they
[1:27] had then a no a notable prisoner called
[1:30] barabbas
[1:32] therefore when they were gathered
[1:34] together pilate said unto them
[1:36] whom will ye that i release unto you
[1:38] barabbas or jesus which is called christ
[1:40] for he knew that for envy they had
[1:43] delivered him
[1:46] when he was set down on the judgment
[1:48] seat his wife sent on him saying have
[1:51] thou nothing to do
[1:53] with that just man
[1:55] for i have suffered many things this day
[1:57] in a dream because of him
[1:59] and uh lord
[2:01] add his blessings to the reading of the
[2:02] word you all can be seated
[2:05] um
[2:06] so um i want to maybe i can pull it up
[2:10] on here
[2:11] um
[2:14] i have to
[2:15] i actually want to pull this scripture
[2:17] up
[2:17] oh is my tablet dead
[2:21] okay that's booting up so um
[2:24] i'll just pull it up on my phone
[2:26] um i want to go to
[2:31] um the same scripture
[2:34] which i'll come
[2:36] pardon me
[2:38] my machine died and so now i'm having to
[2:41] uh
[2:44] kind of go about this sideways um
[2:47] i want to go down to
[3:04] oops
[3:08] okay here we go
[3:12] so
[3:13] um one of the things that
[3:15] i found kind of interesting maybe you
[3:18] will too
[3:19] is the fact that
[3:21] that scripture it
[3:23] where it talks about who barabbas is and
[3:25] this is really interesting because i i
[3:27] wanted to look into that a little bit
[3:29] and as it turns out um
[3:31] and this is
[3:33] there's there's some debate as to
[3:35] um this because some of the early
[3:37] transcripts of the book of matthew have
[3:39] this and some of them don't um though
[3:41] the oldest ones that i could find kind
[3:43] of confirm this and then strong's
[3:44] confirms this
[3:47] and oddly enough one of the only modern
[3:50] translations that i could find that
[3:51] includes this is actually the niv
[3:55] of the book of matthew and if we read i
[3:57] want to read
[3:58] this matthew 27
[4:00] starting at verse 15 and this is from
[4:02] the niv
[4:04] now it was the governor's custom at the
[4:05] festival to release a prisoner chosen by
[4:08] the crowd at that time they had a
[4:10] well-known prisoner whose name was jesus
[4:12] barabbas so when the crowd had gathered
[4:15] pilate asked them which one do you want
[4:18] me to release to you jesus barabbas or
[4:20] jesus who is called the messiah for he
[4:23] knew
[4:24] it was out of self-interest that they
[4:26] had handed jesus over to him
[4:29] so this strikes me
[4:31] because
[4:34] it strikes me that there's two jesus on
[4:36] trial here
[4:38] right that the crowd the religious world
[4:40] of the day had the option of two jesuses
[4:45] one of them obviously they crucified and
[4:47] the other one they chose because
[4:53] they chose barabbas which by the way the
[4:56] name barabbas means the son of god
[5:00] so these two men
[5:02] in appearance are very close
[5:06] they're very very close and to the
[5:07] religious world one of them looks a lot
[5:10] more appealing because he was in line
[5:12] with their preconceived notion of what
[5:14] the messiah would be
[5:16] right
[5:16] because
[5:18] barabbas and this is uh in in mark
[5:21] chapter 15 it says this very a lot more
[5:24] clearly but
[5:25] in the telling of the same story but
[5:27] barabbas was on trial for insurrection
[5:30] right insurrection or or trying to
[5:32] overthrow the government
[5:34] which
[5:35] to the jews that's what the messiah
[5:37] would do right he's going to overthrow
[5:39] the romans and this also makes sense
[5:40] because the romans didn't just crucify
[5:42] anybody
[5:43] crucifixion wasn't just something you
[5:45] they did willy-nilly it was specifically
[5:47] reserved for insurrectionists and people
[5:50] who were trying to overthrow the roman
[5:52] government it was a statement
[5:54] to is a public execution and they'd be
[5:58] left up there for days for all the
[5:59] people to see this is what happens if
[6:01] you stand up to the romans
[6:03] right
[6:04] and so this is why they're going to
[6:05] crucify him
[6:07] because he wasn't just a robber he
[6:09] wasn't even just a murderer he was
[6:11] someone who was challenging the roman
[6:13] government and that's what the jews saw
[6:16] as
[6:18] what the messiah would be
[6:20] because their view of the messiah was
[6:22] political
[6:24] right because i mean and this kind of
[6:26] makes sense because the entire
[6:28] history of the jewish church was that
[6:30] god dealt with them politically they had
[6:32] a law they had um
[6:34] you know
[6:35] the the levitical law organized them
[6:37] politically and how they would govern
[6:39] themselves
[6:41] whereas with jesus that wasn't the case
[6:44] right jesus's message was entirely
[6:46] non-political in fact
[6:50] jesus
[6:51] told people to give unto caesar what was
[6:52] caesar's
[6:54] right that wasn't just taxes
[6:56] right that was that was everything you
[6:58] do you know obey the rulers that are set
[7:01] over you because
[7:02] the kingdom of god is not
[7:05] political
[7:06] right
[7:08] but see the jews saw this as exactly
[7:11] what
[7:12] they were looking for it was he
[7:14] barabbas was the jesus that catered to
[7:18] their
[7:19] understanding of what the messiah would
[7:20] be yeah amen
[7:22] um
[7:25] let's see here um
[7:30] now um
[7:33] and we can see this again in the church
[7:36] today
[7:37] if you look at um
[7:40] all so much of the church
[7:42] nowadays is so invested in politics and
[7:45] campaigning against
[7:48] oh well we have to be active in our
[7:49] local elections because the school
[7:50] boards don't you see what they're doing
[7:52] in the schools and all these horrible
[7:54] things and oh you know we gotta we gotta
[7:56] stand up to those
[7:58] those democrats and and all the rhinos
[8:00] too you know like all those those
[8:02] republicans who are who are just gonna
[8:04] lay down and not stand up for the
[8:05] democrats we gotta get them out of the
[8:07] office in the primaries and they they
[8:08] you cannot
[8:11] turn on as brother jason demars talked
[8:13] about um previously it so struck me
[8:16] that
[8:18] the christian world is completely
[8:20] invested
[8:21] in creating the kingdom of god
[8:23] on earth through political elections and
[8:26] through political campaigning and
[8:27] through political parties
[8:29] and through
[8:31] current events and they're completely
[8:32] invested in current events
[8:35] and failing to recognize
[8:38] that
[8:39] the kingdom of god is not going to be
[8:40] made through an election
[8:43] right
[8:44] you know the jews
[8:46] the jews were so narrow-minded because
[8:48] they saw
[8:50] the kingdom of god as only extending to
[8:52] their borders right i mean say the jews
[8:55] were right and the messiah was there to
[8:57] to create their kingdom on earth
[9:00] well the kingdom on earth would be the
[9:02] size of israel and that's it
[9:05] christ didn't come to make a kingdom out
[9:08] of one little tiny strip of land in the
[9:09] middle east
[9:11] right the kingdom of god was global it
[9:13] was way beyond their borders and they
[9:14] completely failed to recognize it they
[9:16] completely missed it there was going to
[9:18] be an entire
[9:19] massive expansion to the kingdom of god
[9:22] that christ was came to save the whole
[9:24] world not just the jews
[9:27] right
[9:28] christ was the savior of the world
[9:31] but their vision of what the messiah was
[9:34] completely confined it
[9:36] completely
[9:37] bottlenecked the power of god into
[9:41] what fit with their denominational or
[9:44] preconceived notion of
[9:48] the message
[9:49] right or it's just to us and nobody else
[9:54] and
[9:55] more than that because it became so
[9:57] political it became carnal they had
[9:59] commodified it
[10:01] right i mean this is you you see this
[10:04] when when christ went to the temple when
[10:06] jesus went into the temple and kicked
[10:07] over the tables the money-making tables
[10:09] you know he does this twice
[10:11] one time it was had to do with um money
[10:14] lenders and money changers and the other
[10:15] time was people selling sacrifices right
[10:18] so you have
[10:19] you have
[10:21] jesus was completely not only was he
[10:23] against the financial systems that were
[10:24] robbing people but more importantly i
[10:26] think
[10:27] was that you had the people the fact
[10:28] that people were effectively selling
[10:30] atonement they were selling salvation oh
[10:34] you know it became so cheap and common
[10:36] that there was no longer a real
[10:38] repentance it was just go pay your dues
[10:40] at the church and you're good to go
[10:43] right
[10:44] so
[10:46] and they wanted they wanted a jesus that
[10:48] would conform to that
[10:51] right that would be okay with them doing
[10:53] making money off of the gospel or or you
[10:56] know the gospel of their day
[10:58] and they wanted a jesus that wasn't
[11:00] going to
[11:01] stand up
[11:03] to
[11:04] their institutions and and
[11:06] uh what they had put into place or what
[11:09] you know uh conformed to their delicate
[11:11] sensibilities
[11:13] they
[11:14] would not tolera they were willing to
[11:16] crucify the jesus that was
[11:20] that was bringing something that would
[11:22] create a relationship because that's
[11:24] what god was after from the beginning it
[11:26] was a it was about family it wasn't
[11:27] about about politics
[11:29] and so
[11:31] i see again today in again in the modern
[11:34] church
[11:36] you know brother jason demars made a
[11:38] statement that so struck me how the
[11:39] modern
[11:40] church would be clothed in newspapers
[11:44] right they're dressing themselves in the
[11:46] news
[11:47] in modern events in politics
[11:50] and
[11:53] i was thinking about that
[11:54] this morning
[11:56] and it's like adam and eve right adam
[11:59] and eve when they fall they're looking
[12:01] they make a man-made atonement a
[12:03] substitute atonement
[12:05] that's some little fig leaf covering
[12:09] well
[12:11] brother branham shows typed that as
[12:14] religion as man-made organized religion
[12:16] that their religion was just some cheap
[12:18] substitute for atonement that would
[12:19] appease their conscience but not
[12:21] actually
[12:22] a tone before god
[12:24] it wouldn't actually be
[12:26] doing anything but appeasing their
[12:27] conscience and nothing else
[12:29] well
[12:31] you know you have people today their
[12:33] their religion
[12:35] has become politics
[12:37] they're trying to appease their
[12:38] conscience it's it's both the
[12:40] appeasement of their conscience because
[12:41] oh i must be right before god because
[12:43] i'm saying something against them
[12:44] teaching some weird agenda in school
[12:48] right or i'm doing my political activism
[12:50] work and
[12:52] campaigning against whatever or you have
[12:55] the other group of people who are
[12:58] you know the jesus that conforms to
[12:59] their idea is the jesus that you know
[13:02] will marry the gays and
[13:04] you know let people live like any old
[13:06] devil they want and not actually stand
[13:08] up against it right you get both camps
[13:11] you get
[13:12] the group who will
[13:15] um you know their their jesus is the one
[13:18] who
[13:19] um
[13:21] you know again justifies all their
[13:23] political views
[13:25] you know in terms of well this candidate
[13:27] is is right because you know he's a
[13:29] god-fearing republican and this
[13:30] candidate is clearly of the devil
[13:32] because
[13:33] you know i don't know socialism but
[13:36] then you have the other side who
[13:38] will completely whitewash or you know
[13:41] completely paint over anything that's
[13:43] prickly anything that kicks anybody out
[13:46] of the plan of god because well it's not
[13:49] nice
[13:50] it's it's not politically
[13:53] comfy right
[13:56] it's you know
[13:57] everybody gets to go to heaven and you
[13:59] know the bible isn't the only way to get
[14:01] there and it's like well okay that's
[14:04] that's your version of barabbas
[14:06] right
[14:08] and the whole time regardless of which
[14:10] barabbas they're taking which angle on
[14:12] barabbas they're taking they're still
[14:14] going to crucify christ
[14:16] because the actual christ is the one
[14:19] that wants a relationship
[14:22] the actual christ is the one who's
[14:24] telling people to not worry about
[14:25] politics because that's satan's eden
[14:28] right that's give unto caesar what
[14:30] caesars because that's not we're not
[14:33] even involved in that who cares
[14:35] our kingdom isn't here
[14:37] right so what they're so what if they if
[14:40] they
[14:41] the schools are teaching something
[14:42] horrific
[14:43] it's a government-owned schools the gov
[14:45] it's a government-controlled and owned
[14:46] school give that school to caesar at
[14:48] caesars
[14:49] right maybe this is why you should
[14:51] homeschool your kids but anyways um
[14:53] the
[14:54] the just completely ignore that whole
[14:56] system entirely
[15:00] our kingdom the kingdom of god isn't
[15:04] defined
[15:05] by the news and politics it's defined by
[15:12] the relationship that we have with the
[15:14] god-made flesh
[15:16] it's the relationship that we have when
[15:18] we manifest the god made flesh
[15:22] though the real
[15:25] the real christ of our day is the one
[15:28] who
[15:29] is humble and small and isn't trying to
[15:33] make some big splash
[15:35] with
[15:36] you know again politics and and
[15:39] news coverage and isn't so consumed with
[15:41] the goings-on of this world because
[15:44] this world is entirely
[15:46] temporary
[15:48] you know i was
[15:50] one of the things i was thinking about
[15:51] recently
[15:52] um just
[15:54] a demonstration of just how completely
[15:56] consumed
[15:57] the world is by satan and his program
[16:00] you know
[16:01] you see this this sort of parallel where
[16:04] and brother brandon mentions this as
[16:06] well where
[16:07] you have god has
[16:09] six days of creation right which we know
[16:10] that six thousand years he takes six
[16:12] thousand years to build the garden of
[16:14] eden in the whole world
[16:15] and then
[16:16] you know satan comes in corrupts it and
[16:18] then now it's satan's turn to build
[16:20] satan's eden and he takes six thousand
[16:22] years right and we have six thousand
[16:24] years of history and we're living in the
[16:27] culmination of satan's eden that this is
[16:30] what satan has taken all this time to
[16:32] build and if god's
[16:34] culmination ends
[16:37] with
[16:38] something that's the perfect image of
[16:40] god a man who's the image of god then
[16:42] satan's eden would also end with an with
[16:44] a man who's the perfect image of satan
[16:47] right that i mean satan wants what god
[16:50] has he just has
[16:51] he's gonna he's gonna make himself the
[16:53] one on the throne instead of god
[16:56] well
[16:57] if this is the case
[17:00] what kind of people are gonna be at the
[17:02] end time right the the modern man has
[17:06] become completely
[17:07] an image of the perfect walking image of
[17:09] satan right completely self-involved and
[17:12] involved in building a kingdom here and
[17:15] one of the things that that so struck me
[17:17] is
[17:18] just the environment the culture
[17:19] everything
[17:21] is we have our media is you know
[17:24] old school television media radio media
[17:26] print media all that's going away and
[17:28] we've become invested in social media
[17:30] right everyone's got it in their pocket
[17:32] it's
[17:33] the amount of video
[17:34] i heard a statistic that youtube
[17:37] that to youtube has uploaded more video
[17:39] that if you had everybody on earth
[17:41] watching simultaneously you could not
[17:44] watch all the video that is uploaded to
[17:45] youtube every day
[17:47] right for 24 hours a day you just can't
[17:49] do it there's that much video being
[17:51] uploaded
[17:53] and
[17:55] everybody's personal lives are
[17:57] put on you on facebook or twitter or
[17:59] instagram or whatever there's
[18:01] you know
[18:02] just the complete documentation of
[18:04] everybody's lives um you know not to
[18:06] mention all the tracking that's on
[18:08] everybody's phones it's connected to all
[18:09] the apps everywhere you go everything
[18:11] you do your entire life is documented
[18:14] and so many times we have
[18:16] in the modern world in the modern
[18:18] satan's eden
[18:20] we have people who make do something
[18:21] stupid or or just have a bad moment and
[18:25] their life is forever ruined
[18:27] because that was the worst 10 seconds of
[18:29] their life was documented on video and
[18:31] uploaded to twitter and now the entire
[18:32] world remembers it and no matter what
[18:34] they do every job they apply for the
[18:36] person's going to google their name and
[18:37] that's the worst 10 seconds of their
[18:38] life will be what is displayed
[18:41] okay
[18:42] which so struck me that one of the major
[18:44] culminations of satan's eden is an
[18:46] environment a culture in which
[18:48] redemption is impossible you will never
[18:50] be redeemed in the eyes of the public
[18:52] because your worst ten seconds of your
[18:54] life will be is what is in the front of
[18:56] everybody's mind forever
[18:59] and
[19:00] this is this is the culminations of
[19:02] satan's eden
[19:04] whereas in the modern world
[19:07] right the true christ made flesh will
[19:10] will overlook those things we'll forgive
[19:12] will will say you know what maybe you
[19:14] did that but that's a you know god saves
[19:16] christ saves there's there's always a
[19:18] path back and because we're not invested
[19:21] in what the world sees and what's on
[19:22] social media and what's politically out
[19:25] there
[19:26] then who cares that you had something
[19:27] bad on social media
[19:29] it doesn't matter our our christ the
[19:32] christ of today is not so bothered with
[19:34] that
[19:35] right as long as there's repentance
[19:37] there's forgiveness there's redemption
[19:41] and um
[19:43] there you know but but how much how much
[19:46] of even
[19:47] even the modern christian world is
[19:49] invested in social media
[19:51] right where
[19:53] the the modern christian world has to
[19:55] have their facebook program and their
[19:58] their youtube program obviously i'm not
[20:00] against we stream on youtube and whatnot
[20:02] that's fine because we're just trying to
[20:03] you know spread our
[20:05] our uh our services to those who need it
[20:07] or you know record it for people who
[20:08] want to listen to it
[20:10] but you know what if google came down
[20:13] and dropped the band hammer on us and
[20:15] kicked us off on youtube or
[20:16] you know whoever facebook whatever and
[20:18] we got completely banned off the
[20:20] internet that's not going to change our
[20:22] message it's not going to change our
[20:24] revelation it's not going to change our
[20:25] relationship with christ because that's
[20:27] not our salvation
[20:29] right
[20:30] we're still going to have church
[20:33] but how much of the church world
[20:35] when they come in contact with
[20:39] the social media
[20:41] whatever you know the the various
[20:42] algorithms will completely bend the knee
[20:44] and cave
[20:46] because that's their entire
[20:48] foundation they don't have anything
[20:50] outside of what's here and now
[20:53] what's
[20:54] uh you know what the political system is
[20:56] doing they because you know after all if
[20:58] we lose our our foothold on twitter well
[21:01] then how are we going to campaign to get
[21:02] our you know candidate elected in the
[21:05] primaries
[21:06] right
[21:08] and so
[21:09] they're always going to chase because
[21:12] their kingdom is the kingdom of satan's
[21:14] eden their kingdom is the kingdom of
[21:18] um
[21:21] right here and now they're not building
[21:23] a kingdom that's going to last
[21:25] beyond
[21:27] right they're not gonna they're
[21:28] they're they're not building a kingdom
[21:31] that's going to last
[21:32] past the rapture or the tribulation
[21:35] right
[21:36] it's it's not going to go anywhere
[21:38] because it's say it's all built into
[21:40] satan's eden and when that when that
[21:42] eden is over
[21:44] there everything falls apart this is
[21:47] one thing that i just going back to that
[21:50] back to satan's eden
[21:52] you know if
[21:54] god's eden was ultimately
[21:57] pulled apart because satan
[22:00] got people he convinced man to eat of
[22:03] the tree of knowledge
[22:05] right that eating of a tree
[22:08] the tree of the midst of the garden
[22:09] would destroy
[22:11] god's eden
[22:12] right
[22:14] well satan has eden then there's a tree
[22:16] in the midst of that garden called the
[22:17] tree of life and ultimately satan's eden
[22:20] will be pulled apart by humans by people
[22:23] eating of the tree of life and and
[22:25] completely
[22:27] superseding and breaking out of the
[22:29] bounds and the confinements of satan's
[22:31] eden that we would not be subject to
[22:35] um
[22:36] the demands that the world would put
[22:37] upon us whether that be the trying to
[22:40] con perpetually corrupt your mind with
[22:44] fear and anxiety or or just temptations
[22:47] of the world that we would be completely
[22:49] uh completely transcend the world and
[22:52] become christ again become the tree of
[22:54] life
[22:56] so um
[22:58] i uh
[23:00] i really um
[23:03] it just so struck me that
[23:05] the modern
[23:07] how i could see that the the
[23:10] the story of of the world choosing
[23:11] barabbas choosing ultimately that entire
[23:14] story i think is a type of how people
[23:16] have ultimately have a choice
[23:19] of choosing the version of christ
[23:23] that will
[23:25] pet their notions
[23:27] they don't want to
[23:29] and we can we can throw it off on
[23:32] everybody outside these walls
[23:35] but ultimately if it comes down to well
[23:38] i don't want to give up that small thing
[23:40] because it's not that big of a deal
[23:43] even though you know that it probably
[23:46] isn't in line with what you should be
[23:48] doing
[23:49] it's not expedient it's not healthy
[23:52] are you choosing barabbas or are you
[23:53] choosing christ
[23:55] because anything that's going to pet
[23:57] your
[23:58] your you know it's going to be in line
[24:00] with what you want
[24:02] well again is it barabbas or is it
[24:04] christ
[24:05] so i'll leave you with that thank you
[24:07] for putting up with me
[24:09] let's stand and have a word of prayer
[24:16] lord we want to
[24:17] thank you for this opportunity to speak
[24:19] to the people and ask that you um
[24:22] be with them through the service and
[24:24] through the worship service anoint their
[24:25] hearts and open their hearts that we
[24:26] would be able to give the service to you
[24:28] father that you would have come and
[24:30] anoint our hearts to worship and
[24:32] seeing that you would fill the church
[24:34] and the and the people
[24:36] in their minds and keep their minds
[24:37] focused on you and the when the word
[24:39] would come that their hearts would be
[24:41] open and they would come expecting and
[24:42] that the word would anoint all the needs
[24:45] that they would have and they would
[24:46] bring healing and body and soul and
[24:49] spirit and anything that they would have
[24:50] need of that they would be able to come
[24:52] to you and that you would meet all their
[24:53] needs we ask these things in jesus name
[24:56] amen
[25:11] you
