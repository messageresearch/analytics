but they would be your words and your thoughts we love you Lord we ask that you would have your way we give ourselves to you we ask in Jesus precious name Amen and God bless you all okay excuse me all right so I'm gonna start a series today called chosen by God and we are going to go through the the scriptures tonight and some quotes going to talk about the sovereignty of God we're going to talk about the freedom of the will we're going to talk about the bondage of the will if we get to it see how it goes with that sad musicians if you can you can you can go ahead it'll be a minute before I get to the scripture so thank you so much so the the the scriptural doctrine of election is actually the only way that we can rightly understand the gospel the grace of God and the application of the original sin you know it's it's through a true revelation of that that we can understand that if you if you're not seeing election in the scripture you're actually not really seeing the gospel you're seeing a false gospel based upon you're seeing a false gospel based upon human will human effort if it's if our salvation is up to us our choosing our purposes we will fail we will come up short salvation is completely of the Lord it's not it's not from us it's not from our choosing it's not from our purpose it's his purpose his plan his word his work and if you have you have our salvation based upon us our will our effort now you get to the place where you're actually doing your despising the grace of God and you're saying now that there's a human effort that can bring salvation that contradicts the very meaning of the word salvation we need a Savior we can't save ourselves we can't put forth an effort or a choice that would bring us to this position or place where okay now you're worthy of salvation we are not worthy and I'm getting ahead of myself but I just trying to plant the seed and kind of give you an overview of things so understanding election and predestination the sovereignty of God that's the truth that gives confidence to gospel preaching without having an understanding of God sovereignty in salvation you're telling me that we're to go forth to be evangelists and missionaries and by our abilities bring people to salvation it'll never happen it is God it is God sending it is God speaking it's God anointing it's God calling it's God from start to finish we need a god-centered gospel not a man-centered gospel God is the center of the gospel and he brings it to us through Jesus Christ and his purpose his blood it's all of him how can we how can we move forward when the reality is that it's based on our choosing it's based on whether we stand whether we continue whether we achieve something it's not gonna work so ultimately the sovereignty of God thank you brother Brad who is in who is in charge of the universe we speak about free will okay we have free will absolutely no argument there but who's in charge of the universe you and I or is God in charge of the universe is our purpose going to stand or is God's purpose going to stand or perhaps Satan has somewhere in there you know there at the college that I went to there was a professor he was also a pastor named Greg Boyd and he believed in something called open theism you everybody that wants to take their seats feel free I'm just I'm just getting an introduction we'll get to that probably do a quote before I get to the scripture so so this professor I had in college named Greg Boyd he he was teaching this I D of open theism and that's that God knows all the possibilities of what could happen but he doesn't know with precision what exactly will happen because we have free will and we can impact on what would happen there and we had many conversations me and people in my in in the college about this and all of us you know it's it's a harsh thing to say but all of us many of us came to the conclusion that this is simply beyond the pale outright heresy and absolutely it is it's it's literally changing the nature of God and it's completely wrong that's way out of balance but then there's this there's this idea that you see today now traditional Arminianism so Jacobus Arminius was a reformer his viewpoint was different than almost every other reformer but his idea was yes God chooses us but that choice is only based upon for knowing our choice has nothing to do with the sovereignty of God it has to do with him knowing all possible not all possibilities knowing everything that will happen but he only only knows what choice will make and that's how he predestinated Ott's arminianism and then there's Calvinism Calvinism is that God chooses God calls God is completely sovereign over the whole process from start to finish and there's all kinds brother Branham talks about Calvinism being out of balance now you know there's he also says I'm a Calvinist so there is types of Calvinism you'll call it hyper cals Calvin Calvinism or you call it extreme Calvinism it's things that Charles Spurgeon was preaching against it was like you didn't have to preach the gospel you didn't have to have a burden for lost souls you didn't have to go out and do missions God was simply going to save those he chose to save and the rest of it was not necessary again that that's completely out of balance is a scriptural balance to understanding these things and approaching these things it's not in open theism it's not in arminianism it's not in pure Calvinism but it's in a scriptural truth and the fact is the message gives us something even further beyond those things that they never really saw or understood that gives us the ballot the proper balance in those things so the ultimate authority in the world who is it man our will our purpose or is it God can we change the plan and purpose of God ultimately we cannot nothing you can do nothing that the devil can do nothing that any person on this planet could do could change God's purpose so first thing I want to start with in this is that God has sovereignly decreed everything that has happened and that will happen nothing is outside of his control and nothing catches him off guard he planned each and everything that way it as we understand some of these mysteries that are revealed even in marriage and divorce God created within his creation certain abilities or lack of abilities so that when they made their choice it brought about a fall you know he made Eve as a by-product he made her in a certain and specific way so that when she was approached she could fall why because God is a savior God God is love how do you know what God is you have to have both sides of the coin so to speak if you don't know God's wrath you don't know the meaning of God's love and mercy you have to have those opposing they're not opposing attributes but two sides of the attributes love and judgment you know mercy and judgment love and wrath both of those things magnify who God is you have God's wisdom you have all these attributes of God and they need he needs to express himself he's it's in him to be a savior so there has something he's fallen that he can save etc this was God's purpose this was God's plan when did God plan it let's bring up that quote brother George from things that are to be says your birth was premier was pre-planned I guess you believe that every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned did you know that your being here never originated just as at a myth or a thought look at this everything how many things everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you would be here so in other words God had orchestrated everything all along the way so that you that those people that were sitting there listening to brother Branham preached things that are to be would be there I mean think of the millions of chance happenings that took place for that to get to that place not only those people but all the people in in the in history who was the parents the grandparents the all the way back I mean all of the things that had to happen the choices the decisions that they had to make people were others other side of the planet and all of a sudden they're like I'm gonna go to America I mean you think about how God orchestrated all of those things it's absolutely incredible we're gonna bring up our first scripture now psalm 115 verse 3 but our God is in the heavens he's done whatsoever he is pleased let's look at that verse here he's done whatever he pleases so in what does he do what he pleases everything so nothing thoughts the plan and purpose of God nothing comes against it he does what he desires to do and what we desire to do and what what we purpose never changes the fact that God does what he pleases the next verse is Psalm 33 verse 11 the counsel of the Lord stands forever the thoughts of his heart to all generation the word counsel there means advice and it were it speaks of his plan so his plan his purpose stands for how long forever every generation from the first generation all the way to the very last one from Genesis 1:1 to revelation 20:2 all of God's purposes and counsels plants stand it stands doesn't waver it doesn't change it doesn't well well they did this so I got to change my idea over here and they did over here know his counsel his purpose his plan stands it's unchangeable Isaiah 46 verse 10 declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure so he declared he does he just know what's gonna happen no declaring the end from the beginning when when you make a declaration you're saying this is what's happening this is what's happening this is what's happening so he comes what we're seeing today in our world this should give us joy this said this should make us rejoice because what's happening in our world today it seems scary it seems fearful it's not not for a believer now for the world they're losing their mind they're absolutely losing their mind you know I think about imagine the real plague coming upon the earth what I mean people are literally driving down the freeway in their own car by themselves with a mask on and it's not just one person it's a lot of people are doing it you see the fear the irrationality of fear and even you just think just just think for a minute if you have a mask on and you're going all over these places and you never wash it and you keep putting it on what is it doing for you okay getting off the point but I'm saying this is a this is this is the irrationality and insanity of fear in our day and age imagine when a real plague comes and as you see that statistics are coming out and scientists are looking at this and they're comparing what's really happening to the models and it's way different than what they projected and and they made their decisions they the politicians made their decisions on fear and the people of the world are living in fear just imagine when there's really a reason to be afraid it's gonna be on we're gonna be gone praise the Lord we'll be out of here but the council of the Lord will stay his plan will stand once again it's gonna stand something that stands as stalwart it's not laying down it's not withering it's standing and everything is beating against it Satan is beating against it and it's just standing nothing is changing he will do all his pleasure Wow you know this thing you see that a couple of different times God speaking of doing his pleasure we think we don't when we think of God we don't think of him having pleasure but but it's something that God reads he rejoices in himself think about that for a second he rejoices in his sovereignty he rejoices in the plan that he has that he's accomplishing in the earth if he's hath takes pleasure in it should we we should take pleasure in it let's go to that next verse in Daniel chapter 5 verse 21 and he was driven from the sons of man that's speaking of Nebuchadnezzar and his heart was made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses they fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he knew listen till he knew that the Most High God ruled in the kingdom of men and that he appointed over it whomsoever he will sow Nebuchadnezzar is thinking look at the grandeur of my kingdom look at how great what I've accomplished God says all right that's what you think you're gonna be an ox and you're gonna you're gonna have long nails and long hair and you're literally gonna lose your mind and you're gonna be chewing on chewing grass like a cow that's that's the sovereignty of God he says okay mr. King here's some grass to chew on for a while and it's gonna it's gonna go on until until you know that the most high till you confess with your mouth that the Most High God rules the kingdom of men and that he appoints over it whomsoever he will now don't fear brother Branham says don't fear communism that's what we see it today all over social media right-wing people conservative people they're afraid of communism coming over this country don't fear communism it's Romanism that's gonna rule the world don't get your eyes out under the wrong kind of thing you know it's not gonna be Bill Gates that rules the world it's gonna be the Pope the people our people are afraid of these things there's not not a reason to be afraid God appoints over the world whom he wants to rule he wanted President Trump to be the president right now because he knew how he would react and respond and he knew what kind of person that he was and all the leaders of the earth that's the case all the people that are wealthy and rich you know we there's all these conspiracy thoughts and you know the 1% is controlling this the devil is the one that's controlling the whole thing and he'd uh he he moves this one here moves this one here and guess what God is control of it all and he is going to accomplish his purpose and nothing's no one is gonna for that no one's gonna stop that there's there's not a reason for us to be afraid in this hour unless we're listening to the wrong voice God is sovereign over you God is sovereign over your life everything that comes across your way I love brother Charles remember when we met brothers he said whatever happens to me if I if if I die I'm ready to go home but I believe the Lord can can keep me and protect me and that's the that's the attitude that's the heart to have and God is keeping him through through a great difficulty and we believe will be back amongst us and when we're all together we'll be rejoicing over what the Lord has done for him amen next scripture is in Jonah chapter 2 verse 9 but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord Jonah knew that pretty well he was in a dark place a stinky place a difficult place and he learned that when he turned to the Lord and he prayed God brought him deliverance for him I mean you're out in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea and there's a huge storm and you get thrown into the water you pretty much know that your time has come and you know we look at God saved him God saved him and brought forth a testimony in him that would speak to the ones that he was supposed to speak to and so God was completely sovereign over Jonah's harebrained decision because what would if he just went directly there what kind of testimony would it have been so he it was a mistake he should have listened right away but God knew he was not going to do that he knew what kind of man Jonah was he knew that he was going to run and he he said alright I'm gonna have a storm waiting for him and I'm gonna make a fish to swallow him and spit him out on the land now he's gonna have a testimony and do you have a testimony did you go through something that was awful and God brought you through salvation is of the Lord isn't it next scripture Isaiah 45 verse 7 i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil I the LORD do all these things our philosophy class did not like this verse in college but if you really look at the verse it's create evil you know we understand evil is not not it's a perversion of that which is right you know it's taking what's right and turning it on its head it's not a thing and of itself it's the absence of goodness it's the absence of righteousness and so you know if you look at this vert this word evil it can also mean calamity you know and so God God is is not the author of confusion right God is not the author of evil and yet we have here he says he created evil so how did he create evil he allowed evil to have its way to have its fruit why in order to accomplish a greater purpose you know God God didn't say okay I'm gonna make this one evil no that they all those people that made an evil choice they said I will what was Lucifer's choice I will so he made Lucifer chose and yet God ordained that Lucifer would have it within him the capability to make that choice to turn against him and tried to exalt himself Romans chapter 9 verse 18 through 21 will read therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth verse 19 next one that's it now say that unto me why doth he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will nay but o man who art thou that repliest against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour so it was God's plan God's purpose God's choosing he made them with the but they still had to choose and I think that's where we're going to next freedom of the will if God is sovereign over everything if God's purpose will stand regardless doesn't that mean that we now do not have free will let's look at it this way those who reject God do so voluntarily they are not forced to come to him to have life they choose not to have life you say but God made them this way yes that's true but he makes the offer remember Cain Cain was the serpent seed and God offered salvation to him and he got angry he hated it he despised God and so in thing and bring that quote up from things that are to be there if you can you're on free moral agency you can act next one I think yeah you're on free moral agency you can act the way you wish to amen so so simple what is free will if you were if you are a philosopher and took philosophy class you would understand the depth of the wisdom of the statement that brother Branham just made that's what free will is you act you do what you desire to do you act the way you want to act and it's not forced upon you and that's not just saying that well you said God sovereign and now you're saying he doesn't force his will upon you well let's continue John let's go to the scripture back to the scripture John chapter five verse 40 we're keeping you active brother George god bless you thank you on the new program you're running back and forth it's a it's a good training praise the Lord John 5 verse 40 and he and you will not come to me that you might have life you will not come to me your will is that you don't want to come to me your desire your desire your purpose is that you want to reject Christ that's what they want no one forces them to reject Christ that's their choice that's the decision that they want to make revelation 22 verse 17 in the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely it's open whoever wants to come come on hey anybody wants to receive salvation come on and receive it and then they throw it then the stones come the rotten tomatos we don't need we don't what do you mean we need a Savior who do you think you are to tell us that all are welcome to come there's not a there's not with now let's just look at this the comparison okay we have the sovereignty of God and we have the free will of man and in philosophy they always want to pit these 2 things against each other to fight against each other but that's the human perspective that's coming from perspective of a person that's limited by time and space and only understands time in a linear fashion and that's a mistake there is not with man as there is with God a past he is bound by we're bound by things that happened to us in the past choices that our parents made not that there's forgiveness there's salvation there's transformation and yet if you commit adultery and have a child there's not there's not a reversal of that that continues on that follows you along we can be forgiven but the consequences still follow you follow you there's a past that we are bound by God is not in time and not limited by time he's not bound by the past everything is now with God now a 2000 years ago a thousand years from now that's all the same with God because he's outside of the time and space dimensions so that with God the past is never past and the future is ever present so the unchangeableness of God's sovereign decrees is not in disunity with his ability to answer our prayers and for us to make choices they don't contradict each other one dimension is one is outside of this dimension one is in this dimension from the perspective of a linear amount of time we say I have to make choices and that means that God is limited by my choices but outside of time God's gone don't you get it yet yeah the scripture puts our free will he says it says whoever whosoever will the scripture also says God does whatever he pleases and no one can change his plan and purpose and decree so are we supposed to make those fight each other are we supposed to say yes amen that's beautiful yes I can choose yes he is completely sovereign yes he's in control of everything how how can we really trust God if he's not sovereign over everything we there's no there's no way we can if it's bait everything is based on the will of man it just makes my head explode to think that somebody a Christian that confesses to believe this Bible would say that I mean you see people today they're there they're in Minnesota we got Baptists but they're they believe in predestination down here we got Baptists they don't believe in predestination I had so many conversations with people in my college and they said I don't believe in predestination I said you're not a Christian and they're like yes I am I and I I said no you if you're a Christian you believe every word in the Bible you trust God you're saying I don't believe God and I don't believe the Bible although I believe it it says predestination were predestinated it said we're chosen by God in Christ before the foundation of the world and you said you don't believe that well I mean I don't know what to say but I don't I believe that we have a choice and we have to choose him every day okay Wow your salvation is based on something as fickle as you and I and I truly believe that someone that comes to me and says I don't believe in predestination I just have to say you're not we can't even have a discussion we don't we have to taught approach you as an unbeliever as an infidel because you don't even believe in the basic literally a word in the Bible I remember when my I didn't know anything I mean I grew up in a Lutheran Church I didn't hardly know anything and these Calvinist fellows are talking to me and said hey do you believe in predestination meanwhile I'm swearing and drinking and just was in an awful condition in my life but they said do you believe in predestination I said what does that mean so they open the Bible and read it I said well it's in the Bible so yes I believe it that's the proper response you might not understand it but if it's in the Bible you can't say it and you are a Christian or a believer or confessed to believe you can't say no I don't believe it that's nonsense you hear repent this is what you need to do and come to God and get saved I mean look at okay let's go to John 3:16 we know the verse for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life whosoever believes anyone that believes anyone that chooses to follow Christ can receive eternal life through him anyone anyone that desires let's look at acts 13 verse 48 still pulling it up brother George alright I'm gonna do it the old-fashioned way there you got it and then when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and look at that and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed so who is it whosoever believes who is it whosoever is those that were ordained to eternal life now this this brings us to the place where we understand we do we choose but let's go a little further and ask this question can we choose does the Bible say you can you're you have the ability to choose God now it said it makes the offering says believe whosoever will believe but let's look at Romans chapter 3 and there's quite a number of verses here so I'm just going to turn there and we're gonna look at verse enough starting at verse 9 and we're gonna go through 23 what then are we better than they know in no wise for you before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under sin so this verse here as saying we we proved this previously so in chapter 1 verses 18 through the end he shows the life of Gentiles sold out to sin completely and then he goes into chapter 2 and he begins to point out that Jews consistently disobey the law of God even though they have the law they have the commandments they continually disobey God and now he's saying okay I've made my case I've stated my point and now we're gonna get into what does that actually mean in regards to the gospel of Jesus Christ our what then are we better than they know in nowise are we Christians are we better than they we've proved before Jews and Gentiles are all sinners all of them choose sin verse 10 as it is written there is runt none righteous no not one Wow so now he's really bringing that he's prosecuting us and button we're in trouble it's bringing out a lot of dangerous facts here there's none that understands Wow there's none that seeks after God there's none that seeks God they're all gone out of the way isn't there some exceptions to that well Paul doesn't make any they're all gone out of the way they're together become unprofitable there's none that doeth good no not one Wow not a single one their throat is an open Sepulchre ouch I mean think about what he's just saying there that Sepulchre sounds really nice it's very fancy but their throat is a grave he's literally saying there's the opening of a grave right that's that's your throat well what's at the bottom of a grave with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of ASPs is under their lips whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness their feet are Swift to shed blood destruction and misery are in their ways and the way of peace have they not known there is no fear of God before their eyes now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped in all the world how many all the world now if here's a little lesson all the world that's not just Jews that's everybody that's that's Gentiles that's you and I well that all the world may become guilty before God therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God a couple points that I really want to emphasize from there is there is none that seeks after God I think about that for a second God offers himself freely and he says I have salvation for you I have freedom for you I have complete forgiveness for you I've got a new life for you I've got eternity for you and what what does man and his own devices do does you say oh it's amazing I accept it that's not the picture that Paul is painting there he's saying there's no one that seeks God there's no one that understands they're all gone out of the way so we in our own will do not choose him our will is actually in bondage to sin let's bring up that quote from you must be born again brother Jorge he says first we reckon ourselves sinners and worthy of condemnation and we are all born in sin and shaped in iniquity there's not a sound parcel of us our minds are bad our soul is corruptible our constant thinking is evil every imaginary thought of a man's mind is evil a sinner and also that our body is weak our spirit is no good and we're just full of corruption and how could one corruptible thing bring another good thing out of a corruptible let me say this that in job 14th chapter he said seeing that man is born of a woman is full of sorrow and trouble yet he cometh forth like a flower he fadeth away and on as the prophet goes on speaking he said who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one you stick your bucket down to the well and pull out a bucket of water and it's stagnant it stinks you look at it and it's muddy and little worms is in that water there's no way at all to put your bucket back and get a clean bucket the whole well is contaminated and in the whole soul mind and body of man is contaminated with sin and born and send physically shaped in iniquity and come to the world speaking lies so that his own soul is contaminated nothing good when out can't one cannot redeem the other because it's all wrong and you can't take a bucket full of water here that's contaminated another buff bucketful that's contaminated and mixed them together you've got more contamination no purification to it wow we're completely sold out of us out to sin he says body soul and spirit the whole thing is sold out to sin and then in the sermon sermon Jehovah Jireh the next quote there they probably he was a farmer lived in the valley of Shinar there and lived an ordinary life he probably went out in the daytime and got his meat from the bush and picked berries and lived that sort of a life just an ordinary man there was nothing special about him but one day God called him that's what made the difference when God made the call and that's the way it is to any life it takes God it isn't what you do it's what God does see you say I saw God I saw God you're mistaken no man seeks God God seeks the man see it's not you seeking God it's God seeking you jesus said you haven't chosen me but I chose you see so your your chose before the foundation of the world or you wasn't chose at all you just come to redeem that name and all those names are not on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world is the only ones going to be there anyhow see you were chosen him before the foundation of the world when the lamb was chosen then you were chosen with him before the foundation and you are as I said last night an attribute of God's thinking see that's the only way you can be eternal and only form of eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God so that's all he is the one that's eternal so it's God doing the seeking its God doing the calling it's God from start to finish so so Paul is going through and he's telling us he's trying to establish this is why God is just in condemning you this is why God is is right when he leaves when he has you in this condition of condemnation this is why you need the gospel which is the power of God unto salvation for every one that believes but who are the ones that believe those who are deigned to eternal life believe who are the ones that choose God the ones that God comes and says I'm changing your desire I'm changing your will I'm opening your eyes that's the key he opens our eyes he opens our understanding so that then we have the capability to say yes to say Amen it's him doing it you choose sin because that's your nature you reject God because that's your nature nature I grew up in a Christian home my parents taught me to believe that believe the Bible when someone asked me about the Bible I didn't matter how rotten of a life I was living I said yes to it and yet I wanted something different guess what my wanting something different resulted in a few tears and continuing in the same sin what changed when God came to me and changed me I was choosing him all the day long I was saying I want you I just want to change I want to be different and then when I was really confronted with something sinful I chose it and then I felt bad about it but what happened what what what was different he changed my desire he opened he he opened my understanding to something that I never had an understanding of before and that that's what he does for you and I we can live in a godly home we can have the right influence around us that's wonderful that's the best scenario you can possibly have parents that are praying for you parents that are pointing you to the scriptures parents that are doing all they can with their own fallible life to live for Christ that's the best situation you can possibly have and yet it's comes up way short because it has to be God taking you and changing your desires giving you a thirst for him otherwise you'll just you'll live a nice life you'll be a good kid and you'll thirst after the things of the world and you might not thirst for the extreme things of the world you'll still thirst for the things of the world until he comes and changes your nature changes your desire and only he can do that you can't accomplish that yourself you know God even has put it a conscience within us you know we find that we read about that in romans chapter 1 in and - he's placed that conscious within us but even that conscience is marred and hindered by sin and doesn't your conscience is infallible you see things wrong you you make the wrong choices and even that conscience will take you in the wrong direction so it needs to be more than just a conscience even with a conscience people still choose evil and then they become as they continue to choose evil they become more and more calloused until there's conscience is not even up in operation anymore it's just gone dormant but even in a Christian home even as a good kid you're going to not choose the right things you're going to choose evil until Christ comes and makes the change in you you're not gonna make the right choices you're gonna go the wrong way you're gonna you're gonna be out of balance it takes Christ to come and baptize you with a new nature 1st Corinthians 15 verse 22 for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive so Adam is that was the head of the human race all of us all the elect were in Adam and were to come forth from Adam and when Adam sinned he was judged and condemned guess what guess who else was you and I we sinned in Adam we were judged in Adam we were condemned in Adam so then came a new head then came the second Adam Jesus Christ and God placed us all the elect of all ages in him so he lived perfect righteous holy life he shed his blood he died in our place he literally took our punishment that we deserved God poured his wrath out upon Christ and he was buried and he was raised up we were in him all of his righteousness all his resurrection his blood all of that now is imputed to us God placed all of our sin upon him God takes all of his righteousness and places it upon you and me that's our only hope so it comes again scripture gives the possibility in Romans chapter 1 that a person could recognize God in his creation and could respond and and in faith and walk in the right way it gives the possibility you understand what I'm saying God will those who had never heard the gospel are gonna be judged based upon what they saw not what they saw in paganism but what they saw of the eternal Godhead in creation and how did they respond what does Paul say Paul gives the answer of how they'll respond there's no one that seeks after God there's no one that does good no not one all are condemned before him this is the basics of the gospel and the only practical practical way for them to be saved is to be covered by the blood of Jesus Christ there's only one way there's only one means of salvation that's the blood of Jesus Christ it has to be applied without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins so without the blood of Christ and the blood of bulls and goats does not wipe away sins it covers them pushes them forward until the perfect sacrifice comes and let's look at that quote and when their eyes were opened 1964 that's what he come for to clean out them kind that the father had given him before the foundation of the world a man I feel religious when I know that to be the truth not he that willeth or he that runneth it's God amen not how much you'd honor how much you didn't do no man sought God God sought you thank the Lord Acts chapter 16 verse 14 and a certain woman named Lydia a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira which worshipped God heard us look at this next phrase whose heart the Lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul that's the real difference what's the difference between the elect and the non elect God opens some hearts others he leaves them in their own condition you say that's not fair God has to give the same opportunity to all he does give the same opportunity to all but the fact is unless look the Lord opens the heart for the people are not going to respond so rather than letting us all be condemned he draws some of us to himself John 6 verse 44 no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day so can we come to Christ in our own effort will we come to Christ in our own effort no no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him if you look at this word draw in the Greek it literally means to drag and so God is saying God is saying I chose you before the foundation of the world here is is the word made manifest before you I want you to respond and and we don't always respond right away but then God comes and says okay drags us okay that's His grace we it's not our own effort it's not what we've done it's what he has done for us we in ourselves you know our our own righteousness is as filthy rags so the best things that we've done in our life the best missions trips that I have ever had in my life in God's eyes are filthy rakes of myself ended up myself but because of the blood of Jesus Christ those things those righteous things that I've done God looks at him and says that's perfect that's beautiful not because I did it but because the blood of Jesus Christ covers me and he called me and he purposed in me and he sent me and it's him the whole time anyways but even that there's a lot there's a lot of this that needs to die still there's a lot of this that needs to change still and so that's what the blood is for we need the blood every minute every day when you and I will never come to the place where we're perfect in this life like the perfect son of God we will never do that I don't care we will come to a place of perfection the Bible says but what does that mean does that mean sinless it does not mean sinless it means maturity completion will reach the place where we've arrived where God has wanted us to arrive and then we'll be raptured and it's not our effort that does it it's the work of God within us that does it and I'm so glad that God didn't leave me to my own free will I'm so glad that God was gracious enough to drag me to Christ to come and say look I you're trying on your own and it's a miserable failure he grabbed me and he said hear it here's my son here's your representative and he changed me put that life inside of me it was him doing it it was him all alone it was him chain who's him changing my desire it was him ordering my footsteps and ordering your footsteps from start to finish music musicians could come so our free will does not amount to a whole lot it really doesn't it's not it's you know people the people that I kind of grew up with spiritually they talked about free will and they went through the scriptures and talked about free will offerings and free will free will God gives us free will and at the end of the day if you really see it scripturally our free will leads us only to sin because we're in bondage to it and it takes Christ to set us free isn't this really simple isn't this just gospel 101 it's not your it's not your choice of Christ that sets you free it's his choice of you his calling he drawing and then then his spirit that changes you and then from beginning to end he's the one that keeps you he's the one that guides your life he was the one that takes care of you and if he if we were left alone which he never will and he said he never would but if he left you alone he would be a miserable creature you you would not make it to the end but thank God he promised in his word that he wouldn't lose a one we we would fall away if it wasn't for him but he said I won't lose one thank the Lord that's that's that's our only hope and and for young people they're listening in and you're you're good kids we we recognize that some of the best absolute best it's not good enough only perfect righteousness is gonna make it and that's only Jesus Christ in his blood and only he can apply it by the token only he can do it so what is my part then ask him ask him to change you ask him to change your desire ask him to give you power to walk in in obedience and be a witness of Jesus Christ that's only he can do it you're not gonna work yourself into it you're not gonna hear the greatest preacher in the world and and while I heard that person and now I got it you might just be in your car driving down the road and say Lord I'm sick of me I want you and he can he could do that it isn't about being here being another place hearing this preacher you can hear the worst preacher at this church which is me and God can change you why because has nothing to do with me it's him from start to finish amen let's pray father we love you so much Lord and we know there's people that are needy Lord and and hurting and many things going on Lord would you just reach out and begin Lord to move in homes and in hearts father to meet the needs lower - to calm the spirits lower - Lord bring
