[7:14] [Music]
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:21] Ask anything in my name, I'll do it. I
[7:25] have three requests. Brother Mark is
[7:28] sending a request for Sister Deborah
[7:30] Lowry. She's having a lot of pain in her
[7:33] back. And you know, I I've I've
[7:35] experienced a lot of pain in my back.
[7:37] Well, it's just so debilitating. Just
[7:39] shuts you down. and it's just um it's
[7:43] not a good time. Amen. We want to pray
[7:45] for her. Brother Jack is fighting a cold
[7:48] and sister Kathy is having a lot of pain
[7:50] in her legs and um this morning so they
[7:54] won't be here. We want to remember them
[7:55] and the Simmons family is under the
[7:58] weather. They're not here today also.
[8:01] Let's pray.
[8:03] Father, what a consolation that we can
[8:06] call upon you in the name of Jesus
[8:08] Christ. Because Lord, you came down from
[8:11] glory
[8:12] and you took upon you the burden of the
[8:15] sin that was in Eden, the sin that was
[8:17] upon man
[8:20] and you took that away for your
[8:21] children, Father. You paid that price to
[8:24] its fullest. And Lord, we stand here
[8:26] this morning redeemed, washed by the
[8:29] blood.
[8:31] We thank you for that, Father, that we
[8:34] can come boldly before the throne of
[8:36] grace this morning, asking that you
[8:39] would touch our brothers and our sisters
[8:41] that are not feeling well. Father, we
[8:43] remember Sister Deborah Lowry this
[8:46] morning. Father,
[8:48] I lift up the name of Jesus Christ
[8:50] against this back pain.
[8:54] Lord, not in anything of myself, but
[8:56] Father,
[8:57] through your word and your Holy Spirit,
[9:00] we're going to claim the victory for our
[9:01] sister. Father, we remember Sister Kathy
[9:04] today.
[9:06] Lord, we lift her up before you. The
[9:08] things that she's struggling and
[9:09] battling with this pain. Father,
[9:13] nobody wants to say the cancer word,
[9:15] Father. But Lord, even cancer is subject
[9:19] to you, dear God.
[9:22] And Lord, we pray for our brother Jack
[9:25] and for our Simmons family, Father, that
[9:27] you would touch them, Lord.
[9:30] Father, you paid that price for healing,
[9:32] not for us to guess at it, not to so
[9:35] maybe some some other time. I come
[9:38] before you, Father, full of testimonies
[9:40] of your healing touch in my life, dear
[9:43] God. And I pray for them. I pray for
[9:45] those that are here that are not feeling
[9:47] well, that may be battling sicknesses.
[9:49] Father, we just come in the name of
[9:52] Jesus as a body of believers,
[9:55] Lord, knowing that by your stripes,
[9:57] we're healed. That's where we're looking
[9:59] this morning, Father. And we thank you
[10:01] for the price that you paid
[10:04] that you pray that you would bless the
[10:05] service today, Father, continuing in
[10:09] your spirit, speak to our hearts as the
[10:13] song said. Father, move aside all the
[10:15] dark shadows.
[10:17] Move aside all the things that hinder
[10:20] us, Lord.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; Whether it's by our own means or because
[10:23] the devil's attacking us, let that
[10:26] consuming fire of the Holy Spirit, dear
[10:29] God, burn away all these negative
[10:32] things.
[10:34] And as your word said, Father,
[10:37] it's yay and amen. And that's where
[10:39] we're looking. Bless the tithes and
[10:41] offerings. Bless those that are
[10:42] streaming.
[10:44] Lord, help the man that ministers move
[10:46] aside that you could speak and we could
[10:48] receive in Jesus name. Amen.
[10:53] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[10:55] praise this morning.
[10:57] Hallelujah.
[11:00] Amen. Why don't you greet one another
[11:02] this morning? Tell them you love them.
[11:03] God bless you each one. Good to have you
[11:06] here today. Our visitors today, God
[11:09] bless you. Go ahead. Brother Andrew is
[11:11] going to sing us this song. Lead us in
[11:13] this song.
[11:17] The more I trust him, the more I love
[11:20] him. Nothing good for me will deny.
[11:25] The longer I know him, the better I can
[11:29] show him. I wouldn't stop now if I
[11:32] tried. Oh, it gets sweeter
[11:37] as the days go by.
[11:42] It gets sweeter
[11:44] [Music]
[11:45] as the moments fly.
[11:50] His love is richer,
[11:53] deeper,
[11:55] fuller,
[11:57] sweeter,
[11:59] sweeter, sweeter, sweeter. As the days
[12:03] go by,
[12:08] &gt;&gt; the moment he saved me, his good grace
[12:10] he gave me. He placed his love down deep
[12:13] in my heart.
[12:16] There's great joy in knowing with him I
[12:19] am going. And ever more from him to
[12:22] depart. Oh, it gets sweeter
[12:27] as the days go by.
[12:31] [Music]
[12:32] He gets sweeter
[12:36] as the moments fly.
[12:41] His love is richer,
[12:44] deeper,
[12:46] fuller,
[12:48] sweeter,
[12:50] sweeter, sweeter, sweeter as the days go
[12:54] by.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Oh yes.
[12:58] The moment he saved me, his good grace
[13:01] he gave me. He placed his love down deep
[13:04] in my heart.
[13:06] There's great joy in knowing with him I
[13:09] am going and never more from him to
[13:12] depart. Oh, it gets sweeter
[13:18] as the days go by.
[13:23] He gets sweeter
[13:26] as the moments fly.
[13:31] His love is richer,
[13:34] deeper,
[13:36] fuller,
[13:38] sweeter,
[13:40] sweeter, sweeter, sweeter as the days go
[13:44] by.
[13:47] Oh, it gets sweeter.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. As the days go by,
[13:56] he gets sweeter.
[13:59] As the moments fly,
[14:04] his love is richer,
[14:07] deeper,
[14:09] fuller,
[14:11] sweeter,
[14:14] sweeter, sweeter, sweeter. as the days
[14:18] go by.
[14:20] [Music]
[14:22] Hallelujah.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; Is it just me? Because I couldn't hear
[14:27] Andrew on that. Could any of you guys
[14:29] hear Andrew? Yeah.

[31:33] big and I won't be shaken. It said my
[31:36] God is faithful. He's faithful this
[31:38] morning, isn't he?
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Love that. Good to be in the house
[31:42] of the Lord this beautiful Sunday. Good
[31:43] to have all of you here. Did you come
[31:45] with an expectation in your heart?
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if if if you didn't, then have
[31:50] an expectation in your heart. Just let's
[31:52] just forget about the what's out there.
[31:55] Forget about life and just focus on the
[31:57] word this morning. Amen. That's uh
[31:59] that's what I want to do. I want to hear
[32:01] from the Lord. Amen. I didn't come to
[32:02] hear from me. Lord placed this thought
[32:04] on my heart on Friday afternoon. He's
[32:06] just been building it since. So, I'm
[32:08] thankful for that. We just want the the
[32:10] mind of the Lord for service. Amen. It's
[32:12] our desire.
[32:14] Uh turn let's turn in your Bibles to
[32:16] Exodus chapter 3. Want to be praying for
[32:18] all those out of town. There's quite a
[32:20] few away this morning. Uh Pastor Brother
[32:23] Matt preaching those services there in
[32:25] Texas. So we'll be keeping them in
[32:27] prayer. Probably the final service this
[32:28] morning. And pray the Lord give them
[32:30] traveling mercies back home and see any
[32:33] visitors here. God bless you. Amen.
[32:37] Let's just turn to the word. Exodus
[32:39] chapter 3. We're going to take the first
[32:41] 12 verses there.
[32:43] Exodus chapter 3 and verse 1.
[32:47] Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his
[32:50] father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and
[32:53] he led the flock to the backside of the
[32:55] desert and came to the mountain of God.
[32:59] I want to focus on that this morning.
[33:01] Came to the mountain of God, even to
[33:03] Horeb. And the angel of the Lord
[33:05] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[33:07] of the midst of a bush. And he looked,
[33:09] and behold, the bush burned with fire,
[33:12] and the bush was not consumed.
[33:15] And Moses said, "I will now turn aside
[33:18] and see this great sight, why the bush
[33:21] is not burnt."
[33:23] &gt;&gt; And notice this. And when the Lord saw
[33:26] that he turned aside to see, God called
[33:29] unto him out of the midst of the bush.
[33:33] The Lord notices things. Amen.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; And said, "Moses, Moses." And he said,
[33:37] "Here am I." And he said, "Draw not nigh
[33:41] hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy
[33:44] feet. For the place whereon thou
[33:46] standest is holy ground." Moreover, he
[33:50] said, I am the God of thy father, the
[33:52] God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the
[33:55] God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face,
[33:58] for he was afraid to look upon God. And
[34:01] the Lord said, 'I have surely seen the
[34:03] affliction of my people which are in
[34:04] Egypt and have heard their cry by reason
[34:07] of their task masters. For I know their
[34:10] sorrows, and I am come down to deliver
[34:13] them out of the Egyptians. It was God
[34:15] going to do it. And to bring them out of
[34:17] the land unto a good land and a large
[34:19] unto a land flowing with milk and honey,
[34:22] unto the place of the Canaanites, and
[34:24] the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
[34:26] perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
[34:28] Jebusites.
[34:29] Now therefore, behold, the cry of the
[34:32] children of Israel has come unto me, and
[34:34] I have also seen the oppression
[34:36] wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
[34:39] Come thou, therefore, and I will send
[34:41] unto thee thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
[34:44] mayest bring forth my people, the
[34:46] children of is Israel, out of Egypt. And
[34:48] Moses said unto God, Who am I that I
[34:51] should go unto Pharaoh, and that I
[34:52] should bring forth the children out of
[34:55] Egypt of Israel, the children of Israel
[34:57] out of Egypt? And he said, "Certainly, I
[34:59] will be with thee, and this shall be a
[35:01] token unto thee that I have sent thee
[35:02] when thou hast brought forth the people
[35:04] out of Egypt. Ye shall serve God upon
[35:08] this mountain." I want to take a title
[35:10] this morning upon the mountain of God.
[35:12] Amen. Let's just go before the Lord.
[35:14] Heavenly Father, we just thank you, Lord
[35:16] Jesus, for this opportunity, Lord, once
[35:18] again to come into the house of the
[35:19] Lord. Father, we just want to step aside
[35:21] this morning, Lord. We just want the
[35:23] word of God to flow, Lord Jesus, here.
[35:25] May you speak to our hearts, Lord. May
[35:26] you open up the the word to us this
[35:28] morning. May you break the bread of
[35:30] life, Lord God. We just want to remember
[35:32] all those, Lord, that are away and
[35:34] traveling. Be with pastor and brother
[35:35] Matt, Lord. Be with each one, Father. We
[35:37] pray, Lord God. And we just want to
[35:39] enter in now, Lord Jesus. We pray and we
[35:41] ask it all in the name of Jesus Christ.
[35:44] Amen. God bless you this morning as you
[35:46] take your seats.
[35:50] Amen. Put that over there. Thank you,
[35:52] bro.
[35:54] there. That scripture there in Exodus 3,
[35:56] it's a familiar reading. Amen. This was
[35:58] a time where God was commissioning
[36:00] Moses. Amen. Moses was he was born to
[36:04] accomplish this work. And God was
[36:06] getting ready to send him off. But
[36:08] brother Benham said in the church age
[36:10] book that he could not do the work until
[36:12] he received the gifts which would enable
[36:14] him to do the work. He had to go out
[36:16] into the desert and wait there because
[36:19] God had an appointed time. Amen. And
[36:21] just just some things to notice uh about
[36:24] Moses here in his desert experience. You
[36:26] know, 40 years he had been in Egypt. And
[36:29] just as much life as he spent in Egypt,
[36:32] he lived outside of Egypt. Amen. Another
[36:34] 40 years in in Midian. So see, he had
[36:36] made a life. He he found a wife and he
[36:39] had a family and he became a shepherd.
[36:41] But notice, God never revealed himself
[36:43] to Moses when he had some great position
[36:45] in Egypt. And he never came to Moses
[36:48] when he was out there in the midst of
[36:49] Jethro and all of his family. God waited
[36:52] until he was set apart from all that.
[36:53] Amen. He waited until he was on what the
[36:56] Bible said, the backside of the desert.
[36:58] And notice how it said that he came to
[37:00] the mountain of God.
[37:03] After Moses was commissioned, I want you
[37:05] to notice this morning. After Moses was
[37:07] commissioned to deliver the people and
[37:09] to bring Israel out, after he was given
[37:11] the tools, it was then that he went and
[37:13] he took his family with him. He picked
[37:15] up his wife. He gathered his children
[37:17] and everything he had need of. But while
[37:19] he was in the midst of that pillar of
[37:21] fire, he was set apart. Amen. See, and I
[37:24] just notice there he's how he said he
[37:26] looked and behold the bush burned with
[37:28] fire and how it wasn't consumed. And
[37:30] Moses said, "I will now turn aside and
[37:32] see this great sight. Why the bush is
[37:35] not burnt?" And catch that how the Lord
[37:37] said when the Lord saw that that he
[37:40] turned aside to see God called out of
[37:42] the midst of the bush and said, "Moses,
[37:45] Moses." And he said, "Here am I." He
[37:47] could tell that there was something
[37:48] different about this fire in this
[37:50] situation. There was something
[37:52] supernatural about it, but he didn't try
[37:54] to explain it away. Amen. The Bible just
[37:56] says that he turned aside to see, you
[37:58] know. So, the the supernatural can't
[38:00] ever be explained in our lives. Amen.
[38:02] The supernatural is once you get into
[38:04] the atmosphere of it and and you
[38:06] experience it for yourself. Amen. That's
[38:08] when God calls you by name. Amen. And he
[38:10] gives you a revelation. Amen. And once
[38:12] you have that revelation, there's no uh
[38:14] devil in hell that will be able to take
[38:16] that away from you. Amen. But see, God
[38:19] had equipped him for a purpose and it
[38:21] had to be at an appointed time. Amen. He
[38:23] was equipping Moses for an exodus to to
[38:26] lead his people out of bondage. Amen.
[38:29] And the Lord said to Moses, he said, "I
[38:30] have heard the cry of my people and I am
[38:33] come down to deliver them out of this
[38:35] circumstance." And there was a word of
[38:38] promise in that that it was going to be
[38:40] God that was working through Moses to
[38:42] accomplish this task. Amen. Because it's
[38:44] deliver. Once you get into the presence
[38:47] of that pillar of fire and God calls you
[38:49] by name like he did Moses, he equips you
[38:52] with every tool that you'll ever need to
[38:54] fight the enemy in your life. Amen. The
[38:56] Bible says, brother Benham says in um
[38:59] let us show show us the father. He says
[39:01] we're planted in Christ and we just
[39:03] drink and drink and drink and push out
[39:06] and everything we have need of for the
[39:07] earthly journey. Divine healing, the
[39:10] power of God and all these other things
[39:11] is in the individual in here that's
[39:14] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[39:16] Amen. For you're planted in Christ.
[39:18] Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost baptism. Yes,
[39:21] sir. and everything you have need of for
[39:23] this life's journey, even the rapture,
[39:25] is in you right then.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I just I I began to look
[39:29] at this this week and I began to look at
[39:30] the the the life of a caterpillar. You
[39:32] know, when it gets to ready to make its
[39:34] transition, you know, its whole life is
[39:36] preparation for this what they call the
[39:38] metamorphosis. Amen. From the moment the
[39:41] caterpillar is born, it starts eating.
[39:42] And you know that it even eats the egg
[39:44] of its own the the shell of its own egg.
[39:46] Amen. And as it grows, it it finds the
[39:49] right atmosphere. It finds the right
[39:51] kind of leaf. Each kind of caterpillar
[39:53] has to find the right kind of leaf to
[39:56] give it the right kind of nutrition,
[39:57] right? The right nutrients. And it keeps
[39:59] eating and eating. And everything that
[40:01] caterpillar has need of is to take its
[40:04] change is going to be laid within it.
[40:06] Amen. It just needs the right
[40:09] conditions. It needs the right food. It
[40:11] needs the right atmosphere. And I was
[40:13] looking at it the other day. And when a
[40:15] caterpillar is in its egg before it act
[40:17] before it hatches, it actually grows
[40:19] what they call these imaginal discs,
[40:21] which is basically a part about those
[40:24] those imaginal discs. They're these
[40:25] integral parts that it won't actually
[40:28] use until it's a mature butterfly. They
[40:31] they can actually begin to take shape or
[40:33] form in in in some uh in some species mo
[40:37] th those those discs actually can begin
[40:40] to take form before it's a butterfly.
[40:42] Amen. And you know, most caterpillars,
[40:45] they actually have to eat from what they
[40:47] call the host plant. Amen. And and it's
[40:49] because there's certain nutrients in
[40:51] that specific plant that helps it
[40:54] digest. It helps its digestive system
[40:57] properly develop. And and if they don't
[40:59] feed on that plant, they actually have a
[41:01] higher probability, a very high
[41:03] probability of dying. And you know what
[41:05] something amazing about them is is when
[41:07] they take their change and they become
[41:08] butterflies, they will actually lay
[41:11] their egg on that host plant. Amen.
[41:13] Which gives it a better chance of
[41:15] survival when it hatches. Amen.
[41:18] Everything you have need of is already
[41:19] within you. Amen. It's just the word
[41:22] becoming a reality in your life. Amen. I
[41:24] was just thinking spiritually this
[41:26] morning. We're getting ready to take our
[41:27] change. And brother Benham says, "Our
[41:29] goal is to drink and push out and eat,
[41:31] to feed on the world, to push out the
[41:33] world, to stay around the right
[41:35] atmosphere." Because the goal, the whole
[41:37] goal of the life of a caterpillar is
[41:40] preparation for its mature stage in
[41:42] life. Amen. It's preparation for its
[41:44] change. But see, you have to be fed the
[41:46] right nutrients. You have to be in the
[41:48] right environment. Amen. Brother Venom
[41:51] says this in the church age book. He
[41:52] said, "The bride church will mature and
[41:55] her ripeness shall be an identification
[41:57] with her Lord by the means of the word."
[42:00] Amen. And her head who will come to her
[42:03] is the mystery of godliness which indeed
[42:06] is Christ. And he says a little bit
[42:08] further, the true vine with the fullness
[42:10] of the spirit and the word will do the
[42:13] very acts of power that Jesus did just
[42:16] as she nears her headstone. And catch
[42:19] this part. He says, "Becoming like him
[42:21] through the word, Jesus will come that
[42:23] the bride and groom may be forever
[42:25] united as one." Amen. And I thought
[42:28] about the correlation this morning
[42:29] because as that process is taking place
[42:32] in our life and as we're beginning to
[42:34] near our change, as we're beginning to
[42:36] to take upon what what the Lord has
[42:38] called us to be, there's a manifestation
[42:40] of us becoming more and more like Christ
[42:44] through the word. Amen. Brother Benham,
[42:46] he just to use his words as she nears
[42:48] her headstone becoming like him through
[42:51] the word, her ripeness. You know,
[42:53] ripeness speaks of a seed that's been
[42:55] given the right nutrients. Amen. That's
[42:57] been under the right conditions. It's
[42:59] been in the presence of the sunlight.
[43:01] Amen. And he said the bride will mature
[43:03] and it shall be an identification with
[43:05] her Lord by the means of the word. Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; And I don't want that to sound over
[43:09] complicated this morning. It's just a
[43:11] simple process of you eating the right
[43:13] thing. You eating the right nutrients.
[43:15] You being in the right atmosphere so the
[43:17] Lord can change your life. Amen. So the
[43:20] Lord, you have to eat on that host
[43:21] plant. You have to feed yourself with
[43:23] the right nutrients so the Lord can
[43:25] change you. Amen. Hallelujah.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; You stay focused on the right thing. If
[43:31] that caterpillar gets off focus, if it
[43:33] starts eating other things because it
[43:35] just eats, that's all it knows. So it
[43:36] eats. And if it starts eating the wrong
[43:38] thing, it doesn't have the right
[43:39] nutrients in order for it to take its
[43:41] change. And even if it does take its
[43:43] change, when it does, and it's a
[43:45] caterpillar, it won't survive very long.
[43:47] Hallelujah. Because there's something
[43:49] inside of that host plant that gives it
[43:52] the right amount of nutrients. Amen. And
[43:54] I I thought this was amazing here. He
[43:56] said, when you go and you start looking
[43:58] at the life of a caterpillar, a certain
[44:00] kind of caterpillar, when it eats a
[44:02] certain kind of plant, there's actually
[44:04] something in that plant. And it's
[44:06] actually a poison. But that poison
[44:09] doesn't kill the caterpillar. It doesn't
[44:11] kill the butterfly. It just stays in
[44:13] there and it re it detracts the enemy.
[44:15] It detracts the predator. So there's
[44:17] something laid within you. Oh, it's
[44:19] something that's that's that's going to
[44:21] kill the enemy. It's something that's
[44:23] going to slay every devil in your life.
[44:24] Amen. But you got to feed on the right
[44:26] thing. You got to feed on the body word
[44:28] of God. Hallelujah.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; You becoming like the word. you staying
[44:34] in that atmosphere which is Hallelujah.
[44:37] Hallelujah. That it's that defense
[44:39] mechanism. It helps ward off those
[44:41] predators.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those compounds, they don't hurt
[44:45] the caterpillar. They just lay dormant
[44:46] within their body. Amen.
[44:50] Hallelujah. Compounds of the word of God
[44:53] that are designed to kill the enemy.
[44:55] They're designed to fight against them.
[44:58] Hallelujah. The key is to feed on that
[45:00] host plan. To focus on that so that our
[45:03] change can become a reality. I want my
[45:05] change to become a reality. Oh, I want
[45:08] to eat on the right thing. I want to
[45:09] stay in the right atmosphere.
[45:10] Hallelujah. When God calls me from a
[45:13] mountain that that speaks of elevation.
[45:15] I want to grow. I want to rise higher.
[45:17] Hallelujah.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; If you bring up those quotes,
[45:24] Sister Zoe, just have a few quotes here
[45:27] I want to go through together.
[45:29] found this in a sermon 1963. Brother
[45:32] Brandham preaches a sermon titled look
[45:34] and just kind of follow. Oh man, that's
[45:37] real small. I'm sorry. It says that we
[45:40] have we look for Christ to appear, the
[45:44] same Jesus. He said, "When he was on
[45:48] earth a little while and the world seeth
[45:50] me no more, yet ye shall see me, for
[45:53] I'll be with you to the end of the
[45:55] world." That same one who could direct
[45:57] the word and be the word and direct it
[46:00] right straight to the target. That same
[46:03] Lord Jesus is here this morning in the
[46:06] form of the Holy Spirit to direct our
[46:08] thoughts and focus down. Amen. His word
[46:11] to one true and living God, to one
[46:14] purpose, to one achievement. And if
[46:17] we'll just let him do it, he will focus
[46:19] the word right into a place that'll
[46:22] prove that he's the same yesterday,
[46:24] today, and forever. He said it depends
[46:27] on what you're looking at. The next
[46:28] slide, he says we must focus our lives,
[46:32] not what somebody else says, but focus
[46:34] our lives to him. And he is the word.
[46:37] See, if we get our lives lined up with
[46:39] the word, and watch this, then the word
[46:41] and our life becomes the same. That's my
[46:44] desire. I want the word in my life to
[46:46] become the same. Amen. And when God
[46:49] lives in you, he is able to to get your
[46:52] focus on the right thing and to align
[46:54] your life and his word to go in the same
[46:57] direction.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "If ye abide in me in the
[47:01] next slide, and my word in you, then ask
[47:04] what you will, it'll be granted to you.
[47:07] Verily I say unto you, if you say to
[47:09] this mountain, be moved and don't doubt
[47:11] in your heart, but believe that what you
[47:12] have said will come to pass and you can
[47:14] have what you said. Oh my, not what I
[47:16] said, but what you said you can have
[47:17] because you and he become the same.
[47:20] Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Slide four, he says, because the mind
[47:24] that was in Christ is in you, and the
[47:26] mind that was in Christ was to fulfill
[47:29] the father's word, which he was the
[47:32] word. There you are. Then you and the
[47:35] word are focused in together. And he
[47:37] says, watch this. You become a living
[47:40] unit of God. How great is that?
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what I want to
[47:45] become. I want to become a living unit
[47:47] of God.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says a little bit further down
[47:50] in that same sermon, the next slide, he
[47:52] says, "But you know where you stand
[47:56] because you've been zeroed in with God."
[48:00] Watch this. He says, "You see," and this
[48:02] is this is pivotal this morning. You see
[48:04] your own life hitting that target just
[48:07] like those apostles did. You live the
[48:10] way they did. You were baptized the way
[48:12] they were. And you see the same results
[48:14] that they seen. You see it operating in
[48:17] you. Amen. You are zeroed. I don't care
[48:20] what the company says. I don't care what
[48:22] the denomination says. You are zeroed
[48:24] because you know that you're hitting
[48:26] that target. Amen. Think of that
[48:28] statement. you're zeroed in and you know
[48:30] your life is hitting that target.
[48:33] Hallelujah. Then you know where you're
[48:35] standing. He says it depends on what
[48:37] you're looking at. If you're looking to
[48:38] somebody else, you'll go that way or
[48:40] you'll go this way. Any little puff of
[48:42] wind will blow you off target. But you
[48:44] can't be blowed off target when you're
[48:46] zeroed in. Amen. You know, when you're
[48:48] driving a car and you're going down the
[48:50] road, if you're looking at the
[48:52] destination of the driver over there,
[48:54] you're never going to get to where you
[48:55] need to go. But if you're looking at
[48:56] where God wants you to be, then you're
[48:58] going to get to where you need to go.
[48:59] It's about where your focus is in life.
[49:02] My focus is I want to become the word
[49:04] because that's the promise for me.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; I want to become like him because that's
[49:08] my promise. Hallelujah.
[49:14] He says, "That's all. There's nothing
[49:16] going to stop it. God carries it just
[49:18] like David's little rock in the sling.
[49:20] It went straight to its destination."
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says here, I think this
[49:25] is the last slide. He said, then he
[49:27] zeroed, ask what you will and it'll be
[49:30] done for you. See, because you have the
[49:32] mind of Christ, then just somehow or
[49:35] another, you seem to know, listen to
[49:37] this, you seem to know the will of God
[49:40] some supernatural way. There there's a
[49:42] moving something in you says, "Go over
[49:45] here and do that. Go down here and do
[49:47] that." See, there's something in you
[49:49] that's always, think of this, there's
[49:51] always hitting the target. just exactly
[49:54] the way it's supposed to be because it's
[49:56] him operating in you. I know I within
[49:59] myself could never get to where he needs
[50:01] me to be, but I know that when he gets
[50:03] in me, he will direct me and he will
[50:06] guide me where I need to go. Hallelujah.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Whatever comes your way, Amen. There's a
[50:13] moving in you. You're zeroed in on what
[50:15] he says. Your you and the word are
[50:17] focused in together. Hallelujah. You
[50:19] become a living unit of God. See,
[50:22] because you're anchored to that pillar
[50:25] of fire.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; You're zeroed in with the word. Amen.
[50:28] The key here this morning, the key is to
[50:31] stay anchored to that pillar of fire.
[50:33] It's to stay close to that pillar of
[50:35] fire. Amen. There there in the book of
[50:37] Numbers,
[50:38] in Numbers chapter 11, you know, I just
[50:41] was reading this this week. And after
[50:44] Moses had led them out of Egypt, Amen.
[50:48] and they were walking through the
[50:49] wilderness. This was when the Bible says
[50:51] that the Lord was leading them by day in
[50:54] a pillar of cloud and then leading them
[50:56] by night in the pillar of fire. Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; And in this chapter, it was actually, my
[51:01] Bible says they were actually on their
[51:04] way to Kadesh Barnea. Amen. That
[51:06] happened a couple of chapters later. And
[51:09] Kadesh Barnea in Hebrew actually means a
[51:12] sacred desert of wondering. Amen. So in
[51:15] a sense this was this was their desert
[51:17] experience. This was their desert
[51:19] opportunity. Amen. This place of
[51:22] wondering. This was supposed to be a
[51:24] turning point in their journey. Finally
[51:27] they were out of bondage and and the
[51:29] promised land was in view.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; But on their way to that place it says
[51:34] that they got tired of the man of fallen
[51:36] like dew. It says the people started
[51:38] complaining. You see, you know, it's
[51:41] usually in those times of of wondering
[51:43] that people start to show their true
[51:45] colors.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; And the spirit among the people says it
[51:48] displeased the Lord. And I wanted to
[51:51] catch something here. It says that he
[51:53] heard their complaining and the fire of
[51:56] the Lord went out to consume them. You
[51:58] can bring it up if you want. Numbers
[52:00] 11:1. And it says, if you catch this
[52:03] verse, it says that those that were
[52:06] consumed were the ones in the uttermost
[52:08] part of the camp. And that word
[52:11] uttermost actually means along the
[52:13] outskirts or the outer part of the camp.
[52:15] So in other words, those that were
[52:17] furthest away from the pillar of fire.
[52:20] It was those that were edging the line
[52:22] of camp, those that were not close to
[52:24] the presence of God. Amen. And that's
[52:26] can happen in your life and in my life
[52:28] when you don't stay close and you don't
[52:30] feed on the host plant and you don't
[52:32] stay in the right atmosphere and you
[52:33] start edging the line a little bit. You
[52:35] get away from that influence. You get
[52:37] away from that atmosphere. You need to
[52:38] stay as close as you can to that.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Those that weren't close to that
[52:43] presence, you they started getting
[52:45] influenced by their flesh.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's just there's there's
[52:49] something about the atmosphere when you
[52:51] get into that place. you know, they
[52:52] started getting on the outskirts and and
[52:54] they were complaining and it's because
[52:56] it's because their flesh was taking
[52:57] place. But when you can get into the
[52:59] presence of the Lord, you don't think
[53:00] about yourself anymore. You don't think
[53:02] about your needs. You just think about
[53:04] him. Amen. You think about me and him
[53:07] becoming one. I think about how I want
[53:10] to change and be like this presence. I
[53:12] want to live in this place forever.
[53:14] Amen. I want to I want to reside here
[53:16] forever because I know when I get out of
[53:18] this place, Caleb starts to creep back
[53:20] in. Oh, my flesh man starts to creep
[53:22] back in. Oh, the world starts to
[53:24] influence me, but I don't want to be
[53:26] influenced by the world.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; As you get closer, Amen. It produces a
[53:33] change in you.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You start to think his thoughts.
[53:40] You start to operate in his channels.
[53:42] Amen. And and it's just the opposite
[53:44] when you allow yourself to live on the
[53:46] edge. Amen.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; And and you know, I'm talking this was
[53:49] God's people. I'm talking God's people
[53:51] this morning living on the edge. There
[53:53] was an influence. Day after day, they
[53:55] were being spiritually sustained by the
[53:59] presence of Almighty God. Mana was
[54:01] falling. Amen. Day by day and it was
[54:04] supernaturally sustaining them. The
[54:06] pillar of fire. I mean, think of it. The
[54:08] pillar of fire by night, a cloud by day.
[54:11] They were around the supernatural. They
[54:13] went to church. They were in that
[54:15] influence. Oh, but something when they
[54:17] got away from that thing, it started to
[54:19] influence their behavior. It started to
[54:20] influence their thought process. It
[54:22] started to influence how they acted. It
[54:24] started to influence how they thought.
[54:26] Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; And think of it, just as they were close
[54:30] to the promised land, just as they were
[54:33] approaching victory, it says that they
[54:35] were on the road to Kadesh. It was so
[54:38] close to becoming a reality for them.
[54:43] The influence of their past started
[54:45] overcoming their vision of the future.
[54:46] Amen.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; That's what happens the further you away
[54:49] get away from the presence of God.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Start to look like those Israelites did.
[54:54] Amen. Spiritual things, they become
[54:57] common. Amen. Amen. Just maybe like then
[55:00] they hardly even have a spiritual walk
[55:01] anymore. Oh, they could have just kept
[55:04] their vision. And there was there was a
[55:06] a group that did keep their vision.
[55:08] There was a couple. Amen. that kept
[55:10] their vision. There was a couple that
[55:13] looked at the same thing that those
[55:14] other spies looked at. Oh, but they saw
[55:17] something different. Hallelujah. They
[55:19] saw something different.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a Amen. There's a lesson
[55:24] in that this morning.
[55:27] Just a few steps from victory
[55:30] sometimes is the the most difficult part
[55:34] of a road that you're walking down comes
[55:37] right at the end. Sometimes the mo the
[55:39] hardest part comes right at the end,
[55:41] right at the threshold of victory. The
[55:44] enemy starts to work our overtime. Amen.
[55:46] To get unbelief to rise in your heart.
[55:48] Amen. And I just I felt inspired this
[55:51] morning just to say that there are going
[55:52] to be some giants that we face in our
[55:55] life. There are going to be some trials.
[55:56] There are going to be some
[55:57] circumstances. Even when you get into
[55:59] that land of promise, they viewed those
[56:01] giants and they knew they were going to
[56:03] have to fight him. Oh, amen. Oh, but
[56:06] they also knew that there was somebody
[56:08] that was greater than them that was
[56:09] going to be fighting for him.
[56:11] Hallelujah. Oh, and I just know that
[56:13] this morning, oh, if you keep your view
[56:15] on the right thing, it doesn't matter
[56:16] what comes your way. It doesn't matter
[56:18] what giant you face. Oh, the he that is
[56:21] greater is he that is in you. Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Than he that is in the world.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:32] Spirit of the Lord will anoint you in
[56:33] that season to accomplish what he has
[56:36] set out to do. Amen.
[56:39] Try to turn a little corner here this
[56:42] morning. The opening verse there in
[56:45] Exodus,
[56:48] it spoke of how it was on Mount Horeb,
[56:52] which is referred to as the mountain of
[56:54] God. Amen. Where God called Moses. And
[56:57] so see mountains in the Bible, they
[56:59] speak of a sac a sacred place. They
[57:02] speak of a place where the divine
[57:04] presence of God can meet man. And
[57:07] naturally it speaks of of elevation.
[57:10] Amen. You know because as we draw closer
[57:12] to God, we are supposed to start
[57:15] operating in an elevated atmosphere.
[57:16] Amen. See, mountains, they speak of a
[57:19] higher place when only where only
[57:21] certain kinds of life can survive and
[57:24] breathe because they're made with
[57:26] something in them that resides. It's
[57:29] able to reside in that higher dwelling.
[57:31] You know, some creatures, they're
[57:32] actually they're crafted to even thrive
[57:34] in that atmosphere because they were
[57:36] created that way. Certain birds, they
[57:38] possess that uh that respiratory system,
[57:40] which it allows for efficient oxygen
[57:43] extraction, which is vital for flying at
[57:45] higher altitudes. Amen. Because when
[57:47] you're flying at higher altitudes,
[57:50] there's less oxygen. So God created them
[57:52] in a way, oh, hallelujah, to be able to
[57:55] breathe efficiently when they're when
[57:57] they're living in those atmospheres.
[57:58] Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I never caught this before, but
[58:03] there in um in Genesis 4 when it speaks
[58:06] of there was the four rivers that were
[58:08] that were flowing out of the the Garden
[58:10] of Eden. And you know, just naturally
[58:13] rivers always flow downhill because of
[58:15] gravity. So when God crafted the garden
[58:17] of Eden that there's implication that it
[58:19] was set up on a hill or on a mountain.
[58:21] So it was set upon a place of of
[58:23] elevation. Amen. Ezekiel calls it the
[58:26] holy mountain of God. And those rivers
[58:28] were going to flow out of garden into
[58:30] all the earth. So just as Adam and Eve
[58:32] were created and positionally placed at
[58:35] a place of elevation that that's where
[58:38] God is supposed to that's where God has
[58:40] placed you in a place of elevation where
[58:42] you can operate at those elevated
[58:44] atmospheres. Amen. We're designed to
[58:46] live in those places. Amen.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Because God wants his word, the rivers
[58:50] of life to flow in you and out into the
[58:53] world. Amen. Just like that.
[58:56] You know, and he doesn't he doesn't he
[59:00] he doesn't just give that out to
[59:01] everybody. He's looking for people that
[59:04] are willing to take their eyes off the
[59:07] world. Amen. That are willing to to live
[59:10] close to that pillar of fire. And I I
[59:11] was thinking about Moses there this when
[59:13] I was reading this and he's looking for
[59:15] those that would humble themselves
[59:18] enough to take their shoes off in the
[59:21] presence of the Lord. Amen.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; They would be a separated people. And
[59:25] when I was looking at that and when the
[59:26] angel of the Lord spoke to Moses through
[59:28] that burning bush and said to him,
[59:30] "Don't don't draw nigh," he said, "don't
[59:33] draw nigh until you take off your shoes,
[59:36] for the place that you stand is holy
[59:40] ground." It was a command that he was
[59:42] giving Moses to be obedient. It was a
[59:45] simple command to but it was a simple a
[59:47] command of obedience because he knew
[59:50] that he couldn't come further until he
[59:52] obeyed that word. Amen. And when you get
[59:54] close to the pillar of fire, there's a
[59:57] holiness that set you apart from the
[59:59] rest of the world. There's a call to
[1:00:00] come up higher. Amen. But it's an
[1:00:03] obedience to every word. And what it is,
[1:00:04] it's a willing obedience because you
[1:00:07] know that once I get in that atmosphere,
[1:00:09] Hallelujah. There's a change that's
[1:00:11] going to take place. Amen. But he calls
[1:00:13] it for a separation. Amen. Because
[1:00:15] hallelujah, the fire of God, there's a
[1:00:17] holiness of God. Amen. It's just
[1:00:19] inherent in his nature, he's holy. And
[1:00:21] he knows that if those that get into
[1:00:23] that presence, if he can't reside in
[1:00:25] you, that he that you'll perish there in
[1:00:28] the Old Testament. They were afraid to
[1:00:29] come on that mountain. They were afraid
[1:00:31] to even look at that mountain because
[1:00:32] they were afraid to perish because
[1:00:34] there's a inherent holiness of God.
[1:00:37] Amen. And the holiness of God is able to
[1:00:39] reside in you. That's why we can make
[1:00:41] mistakes in our flesh, but our soul is
[1:00:44] baptized into the Holy Ghost and fire.
[1:00:46] Amen. And we're able to reside in the
[1:00:48] presence of God. Hallelujah.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God.
[1:00:54] It's a willing obedience. Oh, willingly.
[1:00:58] I willingly want to s surrender my life.
[1:01:00] I willingly want to go onto that holy
[1:01:03] ground. I willingly want to take my
[1:01:05] shoes off. I willingly want to do
[1:01:07] whatever you say to me, Lord.
[1:01:09] Hallelujah. I want to rise up into that
[1:01:12] mountain of God. Hallelujah. Because I
[1:01:15] know that it's on that mountain of God
[1:01:17] that the pillar of fire resides. And he
[1:01:19] took notice, hallelujah, he takes notice
[1:01:22] of how you react to the word. He takes
[1:01:25] notice, hallelujah, of how you react to
[1:01:28] that presence. He takes notice of how
[1:01:30] you react to being obedient to his word.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:35] Thanks be to God. Hallelujah.
[1:01:39] Brother man, he types that to the Holy
[1:01:41] Ghost. He said those Israelites, they
[1:01:44] they came out of Egypt. Amen. And this
[1:01:46] was their justification. They then they
[1:01:49] wandered around in the wilderness and in
[1:01:52] that that was their sanctifying process.
[1:01:55] Amen. They had the pillar of fire in
[1:01:57] their camp just a types that brother
[1:01:59] Bham brings out and they watched the
[1:02:01] supernatural take place. Bring it to our
[1:02:03] day. They went to church. Amen. They
[1:02:05] were around the influence of the
[1:02:07] atmosphere of God. Amen. But there was
[1:02:10] there was still something more. Amen.
[1:02:12] They even they even beheld what the
[1:02:14] promised land had in view. They even
[1:02:17] beheld the sight of that promised land.
[1:02:19] Hallelujah. But there was just a few
[1:02:21] that had faith enough to enter into that
[1:02:23] place because, hallelujah, there was an
[1:02:26] obedience. Amen.
[1:02:29] When the spies brought those grapes
[1:02:31] back,
[1:02:34] Amen. They they beheld and it was
[1:02:37] supposed to be their turning point.
[1:02:39] Amen. But there was just a small number
[1:02:41] that held that faith.
[1:02:44] See,
[1:02:46] you can't stay in your wilderness
[1:02:49] forever. Amen. There's a time for that,
[1:02:51] and I'm glad for that time. For some
[1:02:53] people, it takes longer. For some
[1:02:55] people, it happens like that. There's a
[1:02:57] time for that. and I'm glad for that
[1:02:58] time. But they had to move on to their
[1:03:01] promised land. Amen. There's got to be a
[1:03:03] moving on to your land. There's got to
[1:03:06] be a filling in order to claim that
[1:03:08] inheritance that the promised land had
[1:03:10] in store. He said, "I have promised you,
[1:03:12] hallelujah, that there's a land that's
[1:03:14] filling with milk and honey. And you
[1:03:16] will possess that land." Hallelujah.
[1:03:19] But you've got to take faith of that
[1:03:21] word and you've got to move into that
[1:03:23] land.
[1:03:28] See, they saw the glimpse of it, but
[1:03:30] they never possessed it the way the Lord
[1:03:32] wanted them to. I want you to take
[1:03:34] notice of that this morning because the
[1:03:36] Lord want you to possess it. He wants
[1:03:38] you to have that. He wanted them to have
[1:03:41] that. Hallelujah. They got in view of it
[1:03:44] and he promised it to him. Hallelujah.
[1:03:56] The difference between,
[1:03:59] because I don't want that to be unclear
[1:04:00] this morning, the difference between,
[1:04:02] Brother Bam makes everything so clear,
[1:04:04] doesn't he? Amen. The difference between
[1:04:06] whether or not you're still in the
[1:04:08] wilderness is that quote we read.
[1:04:09] Brother Random said, "You're zeroed in
[1:04:11] with God." And you see that your life is
[1:04:14] now hitting that target of the word
[1:04:17] because the person of the Lord is now
[1:04:20] residing in you. And he's the one
[1:04:22] leading you. Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; You aren't able to do it, but God is
[1:04:26] able to do it when he lives in you.
[1:04:27] Amen.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; There's no there's no I just thought it
[1:04:32] this morning. There's no more wondering.
[1:04:34] Oh, there's no more there's no more
[1:04:36] wondering. Am I still in that place? Am
[1:04:38] I in the promised land or am I still
[1:04:40] wondering in that place? Oh, when you
[1:04:42] when you've reached that point and
[1:04:44] you've stepped into that promised land,
[1:04:45] there's no more wondering. You're not in
[1:04:47] the wilderness anymore. You've got an
[1:04:49] assurance because you know when you've
[1:04:51] been sealed out, you can't go back that
[1:04:53] way. Hallelujah.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; I can't stay when I'm in the wilderness
[1:04:57] and I'm wondering, but once I step into
[1:04:59] that place of the promise, I can't go
[1:05:02] back. Hallelujah.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:06] when they were in the wilderness. See,
[1:05:08] they were still susceptible to living on
[1:05:10] that outmost part of the camp. Amen.
[1:05:13] Away from the influence of that fire.
[1:05:18] And a lot of them
[1:05:20] had a view of Egypt still. They still
[1:05:23] had a view of Egypt. Amen.
[1:05:27] And notice, I want you to notice this
[1:05:29] morning because when from the moment
[1:05:31] they left Egypt, there was there was
[1:05:33] fighting. And even when they got into
[1:05:36] the promised land, there was still
[1:05:38] fighting. There's still a fight. They
[1:05:40] still had to go out and conquer the
[1:05:42] enemy in their land. But see, the the
[1:05:45] thing was is they were now in a
[1:05:46] different stage. Amen. They were no
[1:05:48] longer in the land of wondering in that
[1:05:51] wilderness. Amen.
[1:05:54] They were sealed into that place. And
[1:05:56] when you're sealed into that place,
[1:05:58] there's a divine revelation that that
[1:06:00] seats into you from God himself that
[1:06:02] knows that you're in that place.
[1:06:03] Hallelujah. Thanks be to God. It's it's
[1:06:06] a it's a humility to know that I
[1:06:09] couldn't do this by myself, but I see
[1:06:11] God residing in me. I see him working in
[1:06:13] me. Amen. I can't live a holy life, but
[1:06:16] because you're living in me, Lord, I
[1:06:17] believe I can live that holy life. Amen.
[1:06:19] I can't come into that presence. Oh, but
[1:06:21] now that you're living in me, I believe
[1:06:23] I can come into that presence and I can
[1:06:25] reside there. Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says this. He says this in
[1:06:33] birth pains in 1965. He says, "And so it
[1:06:37] is in the spiritual realm. It's water
[1:06:39] which is justification by faith,
[1:06:42] believing on God, receiving him as your
[1:06:45] personal savior and being baptized.
[1:06:47] Second is sanctification of the spirit
[1:06:49] that God cleanses the spirit from all
[1:06:52] the elements of the world and the desire
[1:06:54] of the world and then the Holy Spirit
[1:06:56] comes in and it gives new birth and
[1:06:58] fills up that sanctified vessel." And he
[1:07:00] makes this analogy and I just wanted you
[1:07:01] to have this analogy for the simplicity
[1:07:03] of it because brother Bennett makes it
[1:07:05] so clear and he gives this example of a
[1:07:07] glass and how notice this. He says a
[1:07:08] glass is laying out in a chicken yard.
[1:07:10] You don't just pick that up and put it
[1:07:12] on your table and fill it up with water
[1:07:14] or milk. No, by picking it that glass up
[1:07:17] is justification. Amen. Cleansing it is
[1:07:20] sanctification because it's a Greek
[1:07:22] word. It's a compound word which means
[1:07:24] cleansed and set aside for service. But
[1:07:27] it's not in service. Then when you fill
[1:07:29] it, Amen. and you put it in service.
[1:07:32] Amen. Is is the type of the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:34] Amen. So when you pick it up, you know
[1:07:37] that's justification which is for the
[1:07:39] world. Amen. God sent his son. Amen.
[1:07:41] That whosoever would believe. Amen. But
[1:07:43] then you wash the cup out and you
[1:07:45] cleanse it. And sanctified means that
[1:07:47] you're cleansed and you're set aside.
[1:07:48] But there's got to come a filling. Amen.
[1:07:51] Hallelujah.
[1:07:53] See, and it's what fills you. It's it's
[1:07:55] the rivers of of of life that fill that
[1:07:58] cup. It's it's the revelation of the
[1:08:00] Lord that flows into your life like that
[1:08:02] river. And now you're able to reside in
[1:08:04] that elevated atmosphere high upon the
[1:08:06] mountain. Amen. I hope it doesn't sound
[1:08:08] like there's some kind of pride in that.
[1:08:09] There's not. I hope it doesn't ever get
[1:08:11] seen like that. But what it is is God
[1:08:13] wants to have a close fellowship with
[1:08:15] you and with me, saints of God. Amen.
[1:08:18] But he's a holy God. So there's a
[1:08:20] channel, a channel of obedience that
[1:08:23] Moses could stay in the presence of that
[1:08:25] pillar of fire when he was obedient to
[1:08:27] his word. Hallelujah. And God wanted him
[1:08:30] to. And God wants you to this morning.
[1:08:32] He wants you to be able to reside there.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; He wants to be able to fellowship with
[1:08:36] you there day and night. Amen. But he
[1:08:39] knows that if you get into that presence
[1:08:41] and you haven't been washed clean and
[1:08:43] filled up with his spirit.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:49] Amen. So, what it is is a place that you
[1:08:52] recognize that there's that closer
[1:08:55] fellowship where that divine river of
[1:08:57] life can actually live inside your
[1:08:59] vessel. Amen. Isn't that the place that
[1:09:01] you want to be this morning? Oh, that's
[1:09:03] the place I want to be at, friends.
[1:09:05] Amen. And the Lord, he says, uh, he
[1:09:09] said, the Lord noticed that he turned
[1:09:12] aside from the things of the world.
[1:09:15] Notice
[1:09:16] it said that Moses turned aside. The
[1:09:19] Lord called him. The Lord noticed that
[1:09:21] he turned aside. Then he called him by
[1:09:23] name. Then Moses came. Then God said,
[1:09:27] "Take off the shoes." Then he came into
[1:09:29] that presence.
[1:09:31] Amen.
[1:09:39] Amen.
[1:09:42] The Lord
[1:09:43] The Lord will notice that we've seen
[1:09:46] that pillar of fire.
[1:09:51] Amen.
[1:09:57] He sent a me He sent a man with a
[1:09:59] message there
[1:10:01] like he did there with Moses. Amen.
[1:10:04] Moses had a message. Amen. I'm going to
[1:10:07] bring you I'm going to bring these
[1:10:08] people out of Egypt. Amen.
[1:10:11] And today, this is elementary, I know,
[1:10:14] but today we've been given a message.
[1:10:16] Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; And he placed the sword of the Lord in
[1:10:20] the hands of the prophet. And you know
[1:10:23] where he did it? On top of a mountain.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He did it at a place of
[1:10:29] elevation. Amen. And if you just look at
[1:10:32] the word and you look at how God works
[1:10:34] and you look at the the events that took
[1:10:36] place, you can't see anything else
[1:10:38] because God works the same way always.
[1:10:40] Amen. He did it upon a mountain. He
[1:10:42] placed the sword of the word. Amen. He
[1:10:44] he he gave you that that that ability to
[1:10:46] come into his presence. Amen. To come
[1:10:48] out of the the the system of the world.
[1:10:50] Amen. Even if you never were in a
[1:10:52] denomination system, you can sit in a
[1:10:54] message church and still be in that
[1:10:55] system. Amen. because you've never come
[1:10:57] out of sanctification and into the Holy
[1:11:00] Ghost.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; The message was to come out of bondage.
[1:11:05] Amen. To come out of the world. To live
[1:11:08] free from condemnation. Amen.
[1:11:11] To live in a soaring atmosphere where
[1:11:14] the rivers of living water can literally
[1:11:16] flow into your soul and then out into
[1:11:18] your spirit and then out of your flesh
[1:11:20] and then we can flow out into the world.
[1:11:22] Amen.
[1:11:24] That's the message we preach. Glory to
[1:11:26] God.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; You know, the next time
[1:11:32] the next time that Moses came into
[1:11:34] contact with God on a mountain after
[1:11:36] that first Mount Horb encounter was a
[1:11:38] little bit later there in Exodus. He he
[1:11:40] says that Moses went up to God and the
[1:11:43] Lord called unto him out of the mountain
[1:11:46] and he said to Moses, "You have seen
[1:11:48] what I've done, how I bear you on
[1:11:52] eagle's wings
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; and brought you unto myself." This is
[1:11:56] this is right out of the word. Isn't
[1:11:57] that beautiful? How I brought you unto
[1:11:59] myself. See, see, he continues to speak
[1:12:01] of these elevated atmospheres. He says,
[1:12:04] "On a mountain where eagles fly."
[1:12:06] Hallelujah. And he said, "If you just
[1:12:08] obey my voice," oh, if you just obey my
[1:12:12] voice and keep my covenant that you'll
[1:12:14] be a peculiar treasure unto me.
[1:12:16] Hallelujah. And he says that above all
[1:12:19] people. Amen. That's not you calling
[1:12:23] yourself up. That's God calling you up.
[1:12:25] Amen.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Think of that.
[1:12:28] Few chapters later, I love this. When
[1:12:30] Moses came there in Exodus 33, he came
[1:12:32] to what was considered the tent of
[1:12:34] meetings. Amen. And it says that Moses
[1:12:36] entered into the tabernacle and the
[1:12:39] cloudy pillar descended. Think of that.
[1:12:42] The presence of the Lord is always in a
[1:12:44] place of ascension. He's always in a
[1:12:47] place of elevation. Amen. But he's
[1:12:49] always ready to descend if you're
[1:12:51] willing to turn his side to him. Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses was in that secret place.
[1:12:56] And it says that while he was in that
[1:12:58] secret place that the Lord spoke unto
[1:13:00] Moses face to face as a man speaketh
[1:13:03] unto a friend. That's the God I serve.
[1:13:05] He wants to speak to you as he would a
[1:13:07] friend. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:10] Then in Exodus 34, when Moses finally
[1:13:13] came down from Mount Si the final time,
[1:13:15] it says that Moses' face was shining.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was it was radiant.
[1:13:22] So much so that the people were actually
[1:13:24] afraid to come unto him because of the
[1:13:26] presence that he had been in. Amen.
[1:13:29] Amen. See, God was making a way for us
[1:13:32] to enter into that most holy place. You
[1:13:34] and I would become the tabernacle in the
[1:13:37] wilderness where God descended down and
[1:13:40] spoke to with Moses. It had to be in a
[1:13:42] process. So God sent his son and he died
[1:13:45] where? On a mountain. Hallelujah. So he
[1:13:48] could come and descend and live in your
[1:13:50] tabernacle and live in your vessel.
[1:13:52] Amen. So you could have a close
[1:13:54] connection with him because why? Because
[1:13:56] he wanted to speak face to face with
[1:13:58] you.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:08] Amen.
[1:14:10] I want you to notice
[1:14:12] it was without having Amen. to go into
[1:14:17] so much of a different location because
[1:14:19] at that time it was an ascension in a
[1:14:22] natural location. Amen. But in this time
[1:14:26] it's just a descension from the
[1:14:28] atmosphere from the presence of God into
[1:14:30] your soul. Amen. Amen. And when you get
[1:14:34] baptized with the Holy Ghost, Amen.
[1:14:36] you're already living on that mountain
[1:14:38] of God.
[1:14:41] Amen. He kept saying, Brother Bam kept
[1:14:43] saying this. I was listening to the
[1:14:45] third Exodus. So, he's just saying if
[1:14:47] you're spiritually minded, you'll catch
[1:14:49] this. Amen. And then just this morning,
[1:14:51] I know that we're spiritually minded.
[1:14:53] Amen. He's he's getting us ready for an
[1:14:55] Exodus out of this place. He's getting
[1:14:57] us ready for that change. And he uses
[1:14:59] these things. He uses this example. He
[1:15:01] uses the foolishness of preaching to
[1:15:03] come up and show you how he wants us to
[1:15:05] live, how he wants us to act, because he
[1:15:07] wants you to get into that presence. He
[1:15:09] wants you to move into that holy place.
[1:15:11] Amen.
[1:15:14] It's a simple message. Amen.
[1:15:17] He calls a a simple people to a higher
[1:15:20] calling.
[1:15:21] Amen. See, Moses was just a broken down
[1:15:25] old man
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; with a crooked staff. Amen. It didn't
[1:15:29] seem like he had much life left in him.
[1:15:31] But when he ascended upon that mountain
[1:15:34] on the back side of the desert, God
[1:15:36] changed the whole world with that man.
[1:15:39] Amen. And in our day when a man
[1:15:41] descended down and and brother Ben was
[1:15:43] kind of correlates him himself to having
[1:15:46] that backside of the desert there in the
[1:15:47] beginning in 1963 when he when he's
[1:15:49] wondering is is the Lord going to take
[1:15:50] his life or what is he going to do and
[1:15:52] and then he went on that mountain and
[1:15:53] then the sword of the Lord was put into
[1:15:56] his hands. Amen. So the message could
[1:15:58] come forth and his commissions could
[1:16:00] change. Amen. And the seals could break
[1:16:02] forth so that we could have what we call
[1:16:04] the Exodus. Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:09] Amen.
[1:16:11] It's the same God today
[1:16:14] that he sent in his in his pillar of
[1:16:17] fire there in the book of Exodus. It's
[1:16:19] the same pillar of fire that that that
[1:16:22] led the children of Israel. It's the
[1:16:24] same pillar of fire that descended down
[1:16:27] in Acts 2. Amen. A and gave a spoonful
[1:16:31] of himself to each one of you, baptized
[1:16:33] you into with into your soul. Amen. It's
[1:16:36] the same pillar of fire. Amen. That's
[1:16:39] the place I want to reside in. Amen.
[1:16:42] Amen. I just want you to to notice
[1:16:46] this was my this is just my last point
[1:16:47] this morning. Amen.
[1:16:50] Be able to let you go a little early.
[1:16:51] Amen.
[1:16:53] Get to preaching fast sometimes. Amen.
[1:16:58] these places on that mountain, whether
[1:17:01] it be Mount Si or Mount Horeb or Mount
[1:17:04] Transfiguration or
[1:17:07] where God descended down and he met with
[1:17:10] man. And you know, even though God was
[1:17:12] descending upon the earth to meet with
[1:17:14] man, he was still calling him into a
[1:17:17] higher place. Amen. He He was He was
[1:17:21] high upon a mountain, but he was calling
[1:17:23] Moses to come up higher. Amen.
[1:17:26] Amen. He He was He was in a higher
[1:17:28] atmosphere. He was in an elevated place
[1:17:30] upon the mountain of God. But he wanted
[1:17:33] Moses to come up higher. Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; God is in a higher place. And he wants
[1:17:39] you to come up higher. Amen. He wants
[1:17:41] you to live in that place. Amen. He He
[1:17:44] sends his pillar of fire down. And I
[1:17:46] know it was in a simple way. And it was
[1:17:48] from a simple man. But that's the way
[1:17:50] that he's always worked. Moses was just
[1:17:52] a nobody in a nowhere land. But God of
[1:17:55] the universe came down on Mount Horeb.
[1:17:58] Oh, and he set his pillar of fire. Amen.
[1:18:00] And Moses, what did he do? He took
[1:18:03] notice of that thing. He took notice of
[1:18:05] that pillar of fire and it changed him
[1:18:08] and he changed the world with that. He
[1:18:10] changed the course of history. He tore
[1:18:12] down the kingdom in Egypt. Hallelujah.
[1:18:15] It was an exodus. Hallelujah.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; And God sent his son. Amen. So that he
[1:18:21] could reside in you. Amen. He sent the
[1:18:24] sword of the word in our generation. Oh,
[1:18:28] so the Holy Ghost could come back in the
[1:18:30] form of a pillar of fire and live in
[1:18:32] your soul.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; So you could be called out. So you could
[1:18:36] be called to come up higher. Come up on
[1:18:38] the mountain of God.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:46] He's calling us to come up to those
[1:18:48] higher places.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Upon the mountain of God. That's
[1:18:53] where he communes with his people. Amen.
[1:18:56] That's where he he wants to commune with
[1:18:59] you, my brother, my sister. He wants to
[1:19:02] reside in you. Oh, he wants it more than
[1:19:05] you want it. Oh, hallelujah. But it's
[1:19:08] got to be more than just being picked up
[1:19:11] out of that dirty place. It's got to be
[1:19:13] more than just a cleansing. Hallelujah.
[1:19:15] It's got to be the filling. Amen. You
[1:19:17] got to be filled up. Hallelujah. It's
[1:19:20] got to be more than you having a view of
[1:19:22] the promised land. It's got to be more
[1:19:24] than you having a taste of it. It's got
[1:19:26] to be more than you witnessing the
[1:19:28] grapes from the promised land. Amen. And
[1:19:30] you've got to be Caleb. And you got to
[1:19:32] be Joshua. And you've got to enter into
[1:19:34] that place. Why? Because he had a
[1:19:36] different spirit about him.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where he reveals his word.
[1:19:41] That's where he calls you by name. He
[1:19:44] said, "Moses."
[1:19:45] Moses.
[1:19:47] Hallelujah.
[1:19:49] I believe he wants us to live in those
[1:19:51] higher places. That's the place I want
[1:19:53] to be at this morning. Amen. Close to
[1:19:58] his presence.
[1:20:00] Amen. Let's let's stand to our feet this
[1:20:02] morning.
[1:20:05] Hallelujah.
[1:20:07] I want to stay in close connection with
[1:20:11] that host plant. Like those
[1:20:12] caterpillars, you eat the right thing.
[1:20:16] you you're you find your host plant. You
[1:20:19] eat the right thing. The the nutrients
[1:20:21] are digested. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, you
[1:20:24] focus on the word. You you know that
[1:20:27] you're focused on the word because
[1:20:28] because your life is hitting the target
[1:20:30] not because you are or you can, but
[1:20:33] because God is in you. Amen. He's
[1:20:35] hitting the target for you. Amen.
[1:20:37] Because he's producing something in you.
[1:20:39] Amen. To be able to take a change. Amen.
[1:20:44] Amen. Close your eyes with me this
[1:20:46] morning. Do you want to meet with God
[1:20:48] upon that mountain? Hallelujah.
[1:20:53] Moses met with God upon that mountain.
[1:20:56] And and I love I love how he just kept
[1:20:58] calling him. He called him up to Mount
[1:21:00] Si all those times. Oh, he loved
[1:21:02] communing with Moses. He loves communing
[1:21:05] with his people. Hallelujah. He loves
[1:21:08] communing with you. Oh, he wanted to
[1:21:11] speak face to face with Moses. Think
[1:21:14] about that. The only the only man in the
[1:21:16] Bible that he that he came down in that
[1:21:18] form and he saw the backside of him as
[1:21:20] he walked by. Oh, because he wanted to
[1:21:23] commune. Oh, and that's what he's done
[1:21:25] now. He wants to commune with you.
[1:21:28] Hallelujah. Oh, but he knows that his
[1:21:30] presence is holy. So, he's crafted a
[1:21:33] way. Hallelujah. To be able to live in
[1:21:36] that place, to reside there. Hallelujah.
[1:21:40] Close to that calling. Hallelujah.
[1:21:43] close to that pillar of fire.
[1:21:46] Hallelujah.
[1:21:48] Do you want to meet with God on that
[1:21:50] mountain this morning?
[1:21:53] Amen.
[1:21:54] Notice it was Moses on the back side of
[1:21:57] the desert alone with God in that secret
[1:22:00] place. And the sequence goes like this.
[1:22:03] It was up on a mountain. The angel of
[1:22:05] the Lord appeared in the form of a
[1:22:07] pillar of fire on that burning bush. And
[1:22:10] it caught Moses' attention. And when it
[1:22:12] caught his attention, he turned aside to
[1:22:14] see this great sight. And when Moses
[1:22:16] turned aside to see and put his focus on
[1:22:19] that fire, the Bible says the Lord saw
[1:22:22] that he turned aside and then he called
[1:22:24] to him by name. Amen. You see, the Lord
[1:22:28] sees when you turn aside. He sees when
[1:22:31] you have a desire in your heart and he's
[1:22:33] here to meet you. He's here to to walk
[1:22:36] with you. He's just saying you got to
[1:22:38] take off your shoes. Oh, the place you
[1:22:41] stand is holy ground. Oh, you've got to
[1:22:44] come out of the world. You've got to
[1:22:46] come out of your own desires. You got to
[1:22:49] live in a place, the secret place, the
[1:22:52] secret dwelling place of the most high.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, when you have a desire to ascend, he
[1:22:58] sees that desire. Oh, if you have a hand
[1:23:02] to lift up to the Lord, if you're if you
[1:23:04] want to if you want to ascend to that
[1:23:06] place. Amen. Oh, I believe he takes
[1:23:10] notice of your reaction to the word.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:17] Amen.
[1:23:19] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just come now,
[1:23:22] Father, we just thank you for all you
[1:23:23] do, Lord Jesus. Father, and now, Lord,
[1:23:26] we just humble ourselves in your
[1:23:28] presence, Lord Jesus. We thank you for
[1:23:30] your atmosphere, Lord Jesus. Oh God, and
[1:23:32] we thank you for Lord calling us out.
[1:23:35] Thank you for our exodus out of the
[1:23:37] world, Lord. Thank you for our
[1:23:38] wilderness experience, Lord. Thank you
[1:23:41] for the one those years of maybe
[1:23:42] wandering, Lord. Thank you for cleansing
[1:23:44] us and sanctifying us and and washing us
[1:23:46] out, Lord. Father, and I thank you for
[1:23:49] Lord, showing us that there's a promised
[1:23:51] land. And thank you for giving us access
[1:23:53] into that place, Lord God. And I know
[1:23:55] many of us, Lord, may many people live
[1:23:58] in that place now, but maybe there's one
[1:24:00] that that that is is still wandering.
[1:24:02] Oh, may you just come this place. Come
[1:24:04] in this place now, Lord. Oh, Father,
[1:24:09] we thank you, Lord Jesus. We just, Lord,
[1:24:12] we just take off our feet, Lord God, on
[1:24:15] that holy ground. And we recognize the
[1:24:18] the fire, Lord, that you sent in our
[1:24:20] day, Lord God, that you sent, Father.
[1:24:23] Lord, to call us to come up higher, Lord
[1:24:25] God. We want to live upon that mountain.
[1:24:27] I want to live in an elevated atmosphere
[1:24:29] with you, Lord Jesus. I know I got the
[1:24:32] world, Lord. I know I live in the world,
[1:24:34] Lord. I know that my flesh man still
[1:24:36] makes mistakes, Lord Jesus. Oh, but the
[1:24:39] type is is that once you get into that
[1:24:41] promised land, it doesn't matter if
[1:24:43] you've made a mistake. Oh, you get back
[1:24:45] up cuz you've got a promise that you're
[1:24:47] sealed into that place. Thank you for
[1:24:48] that, Lord. Oh, we love you now, Father.
[1:24:52] We just commit this service. I commit
[1:24:53] every individual now, Lord God, into
[1:24:57] your hands, Lord. Father, you saw every
[1:24:59] hand that was lifted. Maybe even a hand
[1:25:01] wasn't Lord God, but you see the desire
[1:25:03] in their hearts, Lord Jesus. Father, may
[1:25:05] you just descend down, Father. Oh God,
[1:25:08] when you when you saw that that Moses
[1:25:11] turned aside and Lord, you descended,
[1:25:13] Lord, may you just descend just for a
[1:25:15] moment, Lord. And Father, as we just
[1:25:18] Lord, worship you for just a moment,
[1:25:20] Lord, after the word here has gone
[1:25:21] forth. We thank you for the word. Thank
[1:25:24] you for Lord just placing the burden on
[1:25:26] my heart, Lord.
[1:25:28] Oh, Father, we just worship you this
[1:25:29] morning, Lord. You're the reason we're
[1:25:31] here, Lord. You're you're you're the
[1:25:33] reason we live. Oh, God. We we love
[1:25:36] eating on the word, Lord Jesus. We love
[1:25:38] eating on the body word, Lord. Father,
[1:25:42] Lord, let it just produce a change in
[1:25:43] us, Father God, where we're just like
[1:25:46] those caterpillars, Lord God, and some
[1:25:48] of those species, Lord, where, Father,
[1:25:50] that those those discs, Lord, begin to
[1:25:52] to manifest, Lord God, and and her the
[1:25:55] ripeness, the the maturity, Father, it
[1:25:58] begins to manifest. It just it's just us
[1:26:00] becoming more like you because we're in
[1:26:02] that presence, Lord. Let us become more
[1:26:03] like you, Father. We pray. Lord, let us
[1:26:06] just uh Lord, get a rid of a little bit
[1:26:08] more of the world this morning, Father.
[1:26:11] Lord God, and get refilled. Even if
[1:26:13] we're filled, get us refilled this
[1:26:14] morning, Lord God. Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[1:26:19] We love you now. We just commit this
[1:26:20] service to you. In Jesus name we pray.
[1:26:25] Amen.
[1:26:27] Amen. Let's just praise the Lord just
