[47:52] Wind don't have any time today to recap
[47:56] so I trust that you've kept up with the
[47:58] archives amen Genesis
[48:02] 2 verses 1
[48:07] to3 the heavens and the Earth were
[48:10] finished and all the host of them and on
[48:14] the seventh day God ended his work which
[48:17] he had made and he rested on the seventh
[48:20] day from all his work which he had made
[48:24] and God blessed the seventh day and
[48:27] Sanctified it because that in it he had
[48:31] rested from all his work which he had
[48:34] created and
[48:36] made Revelation chapter
[48:41] 20 start you out at the beginning take
[48:43] you all the way to the backs side of it
[48:46] Revelation CH
[48:48] 20 verses
[48:53] 1-4 and I saw an angel come down from
[48:56] heaven Heaven having the key of the
[48:59] bottomless pit and a great chain in his
[49:01] hand and he laid hold on the dragon that
[49:04] old serpent which is the devil and Satan
[49:08] and bound him a thousand years and cast
[49:12] him into the bottomless pit and shut him
[49:14] up and set a seal upon him that he
[49:17] should deceive the Nations no more till
[49:20] the Thousand Years should be
[49:22] fulfilled and after that he must be
[49:24] loosed a little season and and I saw
[49:27] Thrones and they sat upon them and
[49:30] judgment was given unto them and I saw
[49:33] the souls of them that were beheaded for
[49:36] the witness of Jesus and for the word of
[49:39] God and which had not worshiped the
[49:42] Beast neither his image neither had
[49:45] received his Mark upon their foreheads
[49:47] or in their hands and they lived and
[49:51] reigned with Christ a thousand years is
[49:54] that beautiful let's pray pray father we
[49:58] thank you for your word today and Lord
[50:02] my heart and my mind are full with the
[50:05] thoughts of your word and so we're
[50:08] asking now that you give us your
[50:10] anointing that we might be concise and
[50:12] go through this as you have laid it out
[50:14] to us Lord and I pray you'll make up for
[50:17] my human frailties in the attempt we
[50:20] commit it to you now in Jesus name amen
[50:23] God bless you friend you can be seated
[50:36] man brother Brad if you'll make sure
[50:39] that the back hallway speaker and the U
[50:41] outdoor speakers are turned up good and
[50:43] Loud normally I try to spend a few
[50:45] minutes uh with some opening comments to
[50:48] give the musicians and what more time to
[50:50] make their way around I won't have time
[50:52] to do that today
[50:54] amen so we've read read about a time
[50:59] that we have come
[51:01] to that is soon going to be upon the
[51:04] Earth it is certainly a new age of man
[51:08] that is ready to cover the Earth and we
[51:11] think about a we think about a a Rapture
[51:15] of the church and just remember friends
[51:21] that it's not end all it's not even it's
[51:25] not it's not the full event it's a it's
[51:28] an event and it's an epic event and it
[51:31] is the culmination of thousands of years
[51:34] of God working among the Gentiles so
[51:37] it's not nothing and it's not to be
[51:39] undervalued but just remember that he he
[51:43] there's going to be three and a half
[51:45] more years there's a reward ceremony
[51:47] there's the banquet supper there's Moses
[51:50] and Elijah's Ministry there's the
[51:52] calling of the 144,000 there's Christ
[51:55] coming back with the bride after 42
[51:58] months once the bride leaves the Earth
[52:01] the the the planet Earth and all of its
[52:03] Humanity have 42 months in counting and
[52:06] every 24 hours they have less like an
[52:10] hourglass that's losing its sand it
[52:12] won't be extended it can't be extended
[52:16] prophecy's in place the word has been
[52:18] given the stage is set and the script is
[52:21] playing so we realize that today that
[52:24] while it is called day this is is the
[52:26] time to turn to the Lord if you haven't
[52:29] this is the hour to have the Holy Spirit
[52:32] dwelling Within You by a new birth
[52:36] that's far more than joining a church as
[52:38] we know we're going to deal with that a
[52:39] little bit today and and so we find that
[52:44] that the Earth is coming toward a new
[52:47] age a new a new world order the Earth is
[52:50] not ending the world is not ending
[52:52] people say oh the world is ending that's
[52:54] not true the Earth is Eternal attribute
[52:57] of God and can never be annihilated but
[52:59] we do find out that the order of things
[53:02] are passing away and there's going to be
[53:05] a new order there's going to be a new
[53:06] king there's going to be a new people
[53:08] there's going to be a new there is going
[53:10] to be a one world government but it's
[53:12] not going to be the pl the laid plans of
[53:15] mice and men it's going to be the plans
[53:17] of almighty God and Christ will rule and
[53:20] Reign from his throne for a thousand
[53:23] years a new age of man is ready ready to
[53:26] cover the Earth I'm looking forward to
[53:28] it amen it is the
[53:31] restoration of a former time from the
[53:35] beginning the world will come back to
[53:39] begin again that 1,000 years of rest
[53:44] that we read in our Genesis text see but
[53:48] you remember that that seventh day never
[53:51] got to finish out because sin came in
[53:55] the God's enemy slipped in all part of
[53:57] the Plan of Redemption sin broke the
[53:59] world broke nature man fell everything
[54:03] under him fell and since then Nature has
[54:06] been groaning waiting for the for the
[54:09] reoccurrence where the sons of God Sons
[54:13] and Daughters of God rule the Earth
[54:15] again in righteousness so we know that
[54:19] the world is going to come back to begin
[54:21] again that 1,000 years of rest but I
[54:24] want to point out to you today that that
[54:26] the restoration of Eden in Revelation
[54:30] won't be exactly like the Eden of
[54:34] geneses in one all important part in
[54:38] these thousand years of rest Satan will
[54:41] be bound and there won't be anybody
[54:45] slipping under the under the gate and
[54:47] breaking the Earth again all will be
[54:50] peace forever more on that happy Golden
[54:54] Shore
[54:57] Revelation chapter 10 Zoe uh we're going
[55:00] to go verses 8- 11 Revelation 108-111
[55:05] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[55:08] spake unto me again and said go and take
[55:11] the little book which is in the hand of
[55:13] the Angel which standeth upon the sea
[55:16] and upon the Earth and I went unto the
[55:19] angel and said unto him give me the
[55:21] little book and he said unto me take it
[55:24] and eat it up and it shall make thy
[55:26] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[55:29] mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[55:31] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[55:33] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[55:36] as honey and as soon as I had eaten it
[55:38] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[55:41] verse 11 thou must prophesy again before
[55:46] many peoples and Nations and tongues and
[55:49] Kings now we realize that this is the
[55:53] ministry that immediately falls on the
[55:56] he heels of the Revelation 10:7
[55:59] messenger which has already came already
[56:02] ran already went back to his reward and
[56:05] now John representing the bride has
[56:09] received the book is eating the book is
[56:12] becoming the book because she must
[56:14] prophesy again and that's your life
[56:17] happening right now with the token on
[56:21] display if the token is not on display
[56:24] you don't have the right message amen
[56:27] wow amen you're not preaching the
[56:29] correct message your life is preaching A
[56:33] variation of the truth which cannot and
[56:36] will not redeem anyone you have to be
[56:39] the final voice it's not that you're
[56:42] need to get up here in a pull pit with
[56:44] me it's that you have a greater Ministry
[56:47] and that is the voice of I lived life to
[56:50] the world we must preach among Kings he
[56:54] says here thou must prophesy again
[56:56] before many
[56:58] peoples the Elijah doesn't need to come
[57:01] back and do it you're doing it many
[57:04] peoples and Nations and tongues and
[57:07] kings that is all Humanity you have a
[57:11] mission I say we get to it amen amen
[57:15] we're not leaving here till it's
[57:17] finished so the living bride at the end
[57:21] of this this you you know when you
[57:24] realize that that Revelation
[57:28] 10 takes the bride sees the bride go
[57:31] home and that once our ministry is over
[57:35] then Revelation 11 begins in Earnest to
[57:39] bring up bring forward Moses and Elijah
[57:42] the bride goes home the eagle anointing
[57:44] lifts up it doesn't go back to Heaven it
[57:47] lifts up and flies East and picks up two
[57:50] prophets because they will carry the
[57:52] same message that you're believing and
[57:55] they'll bring they'll be and that will
[57:57] bring the same holy ghost that you're
[57:59] receiving and it will cause people to
[58:02] become part of the first resurrection
[58:05] just like you and they'll be in the
[58:08] Millennium
[58:10] amen so we realize then that the living
[58:14] bride at the end time she is then
[58:18] according to the this prophecy according
[58:20] to the way the Bible lays it out in the
[58:22] Book of
[58:23] Revelation the living bride at the end
[58:26] is the last vestage of Hope to a dying
[58:30] history
[58:33] amen what irony it seems to me that God
[58:36] would put the most important task of
[58:39] Eternity upon the shoulders of people I
[58:43] immersed in the most wicked day of all
[58:46] ages and it's happening in real time at
[58:50] the most critical juncture of human
[58:52] history amen wow the history of God's
[58:58] 6,000 year Plan of Redemption is coming
[59:03] down to this
[59:07] moment this is happening friends it's a
[59:10] Mount Zion Showdown it won't be turned
[59:13] back it can't
[59:15] be it won't be
[59:18] extended the Apostle has the the Apostle
[59:21] has talk talks about in the scripture I
[59:23] believe it's either James or John talks
[59:26] about how that that the one that's
[59:28] coming right here at the end time he
[59:31] won't T I know it sometimes it feels
[59:33] like he's taring but he says in plain
[59:35] language he it will not t I'm here to
[59:38] tell you and that's why the the another
[59:41] Apostle tells us you know don't think of
[59:42] it as God being late to the party that
[59:46] he's just longsuffering but I I promise
[59:49] you that Jesus said that time is exactly
[59:53] in the father's mind he knows exactly
[59:55] when he's going to do it and I'm here to
[59:57] tell you it's going to happen just as
[59:59] sure as a prophet came it's going to
[1:00:01] happen just as sure as a bride is here
[1:00:03] it's going to happen just as sure as the
[1:00:05] seals are open it's going to happen just
[1:00:06] as sure as the token is
[1:00:09] here hallelujah and it's upon
[1:00:13] us that foundation of the New Birth when
[1:00:16] it comes into the believer's heart we've
[1:00:18] talked a lot about this the the Lord has
[1:00:21] really been driving it home this this
[1:00:25] point home in the pull pit not only
[1:00:27] under my Ministry but the other brothers
[1:00:29] as well I thought Brother JD preached
[1:00:32] probably the best sermon I've ever heard
[1:00:34] him preach Wednesday night was so
[1:00:36] stunning and my brother gidon and I were
[1:00:38] talking about it and trying to recommend
[1:00:41] anybody who wasn't able to come make
[1:00:43] sure you get that it's so
[1:00:46] instructional so we find out that the
[1:00:48] foundation of the new birth what does it
[1:00:50] do and we could read quotes today where
[1:00:53] brother brandham talks about you know
[1:00:55] you know and I and I've got a hundred
[1:00:57] quotes today that I'm not going to get
[1:00:58] to and that's on Purpose By Design I
[1:01:01] probably save it for a different sermon
[1:01:03] that won't be part of this
[1:01:05] series but he he makes a reference to
[1:01:08] the emotional sight of things and signs
[1:01:10] and gifts and things that can operate he
[1:01:12] said we've had all of that it's
[1:01:13] wonderful it's all part of it so I don't
[1:01:16] want to take away any part that's a
[1:01:19] part understand but it's not the end all
[1:01:21] the end all is Christ in you the hope of
[1:01:25] glory and the fullness of adoption is
[1:01:27] the change of your
[1:01:31] bodies so we brother Bram says you say
[1:01:34] will I shout he said you might but you
[1:01:37] also might not you know will this happen
[1:01:39] will that happen will this happen will I
[1:01:41] speak in tongues well I do this he said
[1:01:43] you might but also you might not but one
[1:01:46] thing you will do and that is that your
[1:01:49] life will come subject to every word of
[1:01:52] God and that's how you know you've been
[1:01:55] born again because your life is in line
[1:01:58] with the will of God and it's by your
[1:02:01] choice that you live it it's by your
[1:02:03] desires that have been changed it's not
[1:02:05] gritting your teeth and struggling it's
[1:02:08] I want this
[1:02:12] life that's how you know you've passed
[1:02:15] from Death un life when go when Christ
[1:02:19] becomes supernaturally your first
[1:02:23] priority the new birth controls your
[1:02:26] actions going forward from
[1:02:28] now to the day that you get home to
[1:02:32] glory amen where where you began this
[1:02:36] journey from amen you believe
[1:02:40] that you began this journey as a little
[1:02:43] Spirit of Life brother brandham I think
[1:02:45] in one quote refers to it like a little
[1:02:47] angel Spirit uh a little life waiting
[1:02:51] that was waiting to enter a body that
[1:02:53] was dropping from the womb of your
[1:02:55] mother
[1:02:56] a little a little Spirit of life that
[1:02:58] you have no memory of being but the
[1:03:01] mother felt it as a sweetness that
[1:03:04] suddenly came across her amen even in
[1:03:07] the midst of her her suffering to bring
[1:03:09] forth children somehow something dropped
[1:03:12] in upon her a sweet spirit and and
[1:03:15] brother brandham says it it it was
[1:03:18] noticeable and so so we find then that
[1:03:22] you know
[1:03:23] that when we come to the
[1:03:27] birth and Christ becomes a revelation to
[1:03:30] you
[1:03:32] personally uh you know often a great
[1:03:34] burden can I say it this way and this is
[1:03:36] kind of a Direction I want to go in
[1:03:38] today often times a great burden
[1:03:41] especially here in Satan's Eden a great
[1:03:44] burden can come on those who although
[1:03:49] children of God although a seed Gene of
[1:03:53] God although Born Again by a revelation
[1:03:58] of Christ personally to them and the
[1:04:01] soul and yet often times that that child
[1:04:05] of God that recreated child of God that
[1:04:08] Born Again child of God because we still
[1:04:12] live in a unconverted body with an
[1:04:16] unconverted Spirit see don't forget it's
[1:04:20] not just your your flesh and your spirit
[1:04:23] go together because it's 10 senses
[1:04:26] that your if if your spirit leaves your
[1:04:28] body none of your five senses In the
[1:04:31] Flesh will
[1:04:32] function see so so it is your sight and
[1:04:36] your hearing and it is your taste and
[1:04:38] your touch all of those elements of the
[1:04:40] flesh but it's also your memories and
[1:04:43] your reasons reasoning your conscience
[1:04:45] your affection your imaginations and
[1:04:47] Satan plays with all of those to try to
[1:04:50] control he he he has access to your
[1:04:54] spirit so that he can control your flesh
[1:04:57] the holy spirit in the soul is the
[1:04:59] counter to that amen you understand and
[1:05:02] it's the holy spirit that is the counter
[1:05:05] to
[1:05:07] that amen
[1:05:29] amen the holy spirit in your soul is the
[1:05:34] counter to that
[1:05:36] Fallen life that's still in your flesh
[1:05:39] Amen Brother Don Hoffman spoke about it
[1:05:42] very very eloquently when he was here
[1:05:44] two Wednesdays ago that that that we
[1:05:47] have been the old man that old nature
[1:05:50] and our soul has certainly been
[1:05:52] annihilated he's gone he's never coming
[1:05:55] back he doesn't even exist
[1:05:57] anymore but we at the same time we still
[1:06:01] do have to Grapple with this flesh and
[1:06:04] even though we're Sons and Daughters of
[1:06:05] God and even though we're born again of
[1:06:07] the spirit you still need to read your
[1:06:09] Bible and pray even though you've been
[1:06:11] born again you still need to come to
[1:06:13] church even though you're born again you
[1:06:15] still need the Fellowship of the Saints
[1:06:17] even though you're born again you still
[1:06:19] have to turn your head from Evil you
[1:06:22] have to turn away from wickedness you
[1:06:24] can't just walk around you're not
[1:06:26] impervious to those
[1:06:31] things so we find then that that this is
[1:06:35] a sometimes a great burden now without
[1:06:37] the new birth I just want to hit it
[1:06:38] briefly and then we're going to move on
[1:06:39] quickly because I'm really trying to
[1:06:41] deal with those who are born again but
[1:06:44] without the new birth you will just live
[1:06:47] in varying degrees of sanctification
[1:06:49] which aren't bad that's good that's
[1:06:53] awesome you know as I've said even if
[1:06:55] there was no heaven and there was no
[1:06:57] nothing I would still want to live the
[1:07:00] lifestyle of a Christian because it's
[1:07:03] just
[1:07:04] healthier and I I have a much better
[1:07:06] chance of staying
[1:07:08] sane I have a much better chance of
[1:07:10] keeping my money I have a much better
[1:07:13] chance of staying healthy I have a much
[1:07:15] better chance of staying
[1:07:18] married you see amen so so I it's a
[1:07:23] wonderful lifestyle regardless but if if
[1:07:25] you haven't had the level of experience
[1:07:28] in
[1:07:31] the you brother brand say it like this
[1:07:34] you haven't even started
[1:07:36] yet now he said a lot more than that so
[1:07:39] don't just cabbage down on that because
[1:07:42] we do know that even the unwise Virgin
[1:07:44] are labeled as righteous Saints by the
[1:07:47] great king but they're not born again
[1:07:50] and they go through the tribulation and
[1:07:52] they stand and have to be judged and I I
[1:07:54] don't like going to
[1:07:57] court I've been to court for traffic
[1:07:59] tickets and I didn't like
[1:08:00] it I didn't like the fact that I had to
[1:08:03] stand there and try to explain myself
[1:08:05] and and my fate is in the hands of some
[1:08:07] man sitting behind there and think of
[1:08:09] the King sitting on the throne and
[1:08:11] you've got to give an account for your
[1:08:13] life and he's going to be asking you
[1:08:16] like brother Ernie said when he saw that
[1:08:17] dream he said he said everybody that
[1:08:19] came before him he would say what did
[1:08:22] you do with your life when you knew I
[1:08:25] was coming
[1:08:27] coming oh I want to be on the throne
[1:08:29] with him I want all my sins to be dealt
[1:08:32] with before I even arrive there
[1:08:34] Hallelujah I don't want to try to answer
[1:08:36] that
[1:08:37] question am I don't know what I would
[1:08:39] say now to say nothing of what I would
[1:08:41] say
[1:08:46] then if you're in that position friends
[1:08:50] you'll set in a message church or any
[1:08:52] church but even a message Church and
[1:08:56] God's word to you without the new birth
[1:08:59] will be good and useful and practical
[1:09:03] but it'll be letter
[1:09:06] only and and and and it would and then
[1:09:09] then whether you have some kind of
[1:09:11] experience of emotion or maybe you just
[1:09:13] have some kind of drye confession right
[1:09:17] amen with no emotion and it's just a
[1:09:20] mental thing or maybe you shouted and
[1:09:22] ran all over the building if you haven't
[1:09:24] really been Born Again In Your Soul
[1:09:26] whether it's a a dry-eyed confession or
[1:09:29] all the emotion in the whole world
[1:09:31] poured upon you you know and and and
[1:09:34] even you'll sit uh in a Vindicated word
[1:09:38] of this hour and and and but but even
[1:09:41] even if it's the Vindicated anointed
[1:09:43] word really all it can be to you is
[1:09:46] really good effective Christian
[1:09:49] psychology amen amen and that's there's
[1:09:53] some benefit in that
[1:09:55] but but that's all that's the limit of
[1:09:58] it it'll never change the sin nature
[1:10:01] down in your soul it'll never put you on
[1:10:04] the other side in the first resurrection
[1:10:06] you certainly won't go up in the first
[1:10:08] resurrection you'll come up every man
[1:10:10] every woman will get a fair trial thank
[1:10:12] God I'm glad he's the judge not me amen
[1:10:16] so you must be born again by a full and
[1:10:21] unequivocal surrender of your whole self
[1:10:25] to Christ and Christ is the
[1:10:30] word there's nothing around that that's
[1:10:32] right you can't go around that there's
[1:10:34] no end around right on that you have to
[1:10:39] receive the word for your age let me say
[1:10:42] it like this you have to receive the
[1:10:44] word for this age amen you say why is
[1:10:47] that true because that's been true in
[1:10:50] every
[1:10:52] age that wasn't not just New Testament
[1:10:55] that true in the ages of the Old
[1:10:57] Testament every time God brought forth a
[1:10:59] new truth you had to advance you had to
[1:11:02] accept that it had to become a part of
[1:11:04] you what we're saying today is not new
[1:11:07] novel or strange to say to say it's not
[1:11:11] that breaks every pattern in the
[1:11:14] Bible see so so so you must be born
[1:11:19] again the Holy Ghost is the power of God
[1:11:24] upon those who wish to live in the
[1:11:27] beauty and it is beautiful those who
[1:11:30] wish to live in the beauty of overcoming
[1:11:36] daily I vote for
[1:11:43] that the process of course now you know
[1:11:48] to to to to be born again we've dealt
[1:11:50] with this quite a bit it's got to begin
[1:11:53] of course with with with the thoughts of
[1:11:56] your of your mind which is now we're not
[1:11:58] talking about your gray matter we're
[1:12:00] talking about as a man thinketh in his
[1:12:02] heart we're talking about in the spirit
[1:12:03] that mind that's in the heart that when
[1:12:06] you hear the anointed word and that
[1:12:09] anointed word is ministered to you and
[1:12:11] it ministers the instructions of life
[1:12:13] for the way that you are to live and how
[1:12:17] you are to have a token on on display it
[1:12:20] begins with you agreeing with God's word
[1:12:24] for to take effect now that's true
[1:12:27] before during and after the new birth
[1:12:30] that's an an eternal principle you have
[1:12:33] to agree with God's word brother Bram
[1:12:35] talks about that in the greatest battle
[1:12:37] he said if he can just get that your
[1:12:39] mind to agree with his word see then he
[1:12:42] said then that old nature dies and
[1:12:44] you're born again so now you can't do
[1:12:48] that on your own because your human mind
[1:12:50] is enmity against God and that's why
[1:12:52] it's always the grace of God you can't
[1:12:55] the Salvation is a free gift but you
[1:12:57] can't steal it it's the love of God it's
[1:13:00] the grace of God it's the mercy of God
[1:13:02] it's all God it's God and God and God
[1:13:04] and that's it it's the love of God that
[1:13:07] sent Christ into the world see it's it's
[1:13:10] a god whose Throne is established in
[1:13:13] Mercy David taught us and that God comes
[1:13:17] to you and begins to deal with you and
[1:13:19] gives you the ability to see his word
[1:13:22] now you got to make a choice amen amen
[1:13:25] and you should make the good one because
[1:13:27] he don't ever have to come back and do
[1:13:29] that
[1:13:31] again now the love of God causes him
[1:13:33] often to constrain people for years time
[1:13:36] and time and time again but he's not
[1:13:39] required to do that and I've known of
[1:13:42] cases where young people had already
[1:13:45] just teenagers and yet had already craw
[1:13:47] had already burned up all their
[1:13:49] chances and the tank was empty and they
[1:13:51] were never getting any of them
[1:13:54] back they were already had they had had
[1:13:57] already sealed their own destiny by
[1:14:00] their own choices that they did or
[1:14:02] didn't
[1:14:03] make but now as I said today we're
[1:14:06] trying to figure out what about you and
[1:14:09] I what about the believer who truly
[1:14:12] loves God and who truly believes the
[1:14:14] word but yet we
[1:14:17] struggle
[1:14:19] amen sometimes we find ourselves and
[1:14:22] we're even astonished at our own self
[1:14:25] could I have said that or thought that
[1:14:26] or did that or went there or had this
[1:14:28] and what am I
[1:14:29] doing see that's also the love of God
[1:14:33] who won't leave you alone that's also
[1:14:35] the love of God who'll drive you back to
[1:14:37] your
[1:14:39] knees because he frankly he loves you
[1:14:42] far too much to leave you like he finds
[1:14:43] you am why people who say they've come
[1:14:47] to him and there's no effective change
[1:14:48] they've never they've never met the one
[1:14:50] that came to me right right because his
[1:14:53] love is too great he wouldn't do that
[1:14:56] I'm not saying they didn't come into
[1:14:58] contact with the spirit I'm not even
[1:14:59] saying they didn't come into contact
[1:15:01] with the true anointing I'm just simply
[1:15:03] saying they didn't make the same choices
[1:15:05] I made because when I decided for Christ
[1:15:09] he he had one goal and I was all too
[1:15:11] happy to let him have it and that is
[1:15:13] that he became the ruler of my entire
[1:15:16] life and he changed say what did he
[1:15:19] changed he changed whatever he wanted to
[1:15:22] I didn't know what to change I just gave
[1:15:24] it all to him said you know the end from
[1:15:26] the beginning just just make me like I I
[1:15:29] need to be made Hallelujah that's why
[1:15:33] when a Believer comes to him and really
[1:15:35] they want Christ that's why we sing the
[1:15:37] song You Know take my houses my lands
[1:15:40] change my dreams and my plans for I'm
[1:15:43] placing my whole life in your hands take
[1:15:47] the dearest things to me if that's how
[1:15:49] it must
[1:15:51] be to Draw Me Closer To Thee
[1:15:56] see if the disappointments come lonely
[1:15:59] days without the sun you know yet yet in
[1:16:02] sorrow it it's you lord it's it's the
[1:16:04] Lord who's in control of my
[1:16:08] life so now this is this is an absolute
[1:16:13] requirement before this is a requirement
[1:16:17] to obtain the new birth this is a
[1:16:19] requirement in having the new birth but
[1:16:21] to be an
[1:16:22] overcomer this is a requirement to be a
[1:16:25] being born again being an overcomer yet
[1:16:28] to you've still got to have faith on
[1:16:30] that morning to change this body and and
[1:16:34] and I'm and God will use whatever
[1:16:36] Catalyst he has to do he has to use and
[1:16:39] I I'm grateful for that as
[1:16:41] well so we find then that regardless of
[1:16:44] it whatever position and today we're
[1:16:46] focusing on believers who are trying to
[1:16:48] overcome it begins with you agreeing
[1:16:51] with God's word for it to take effect
[1:16:53] I've said that now twice and I'm
[1:16:55] probably going to say it a few more
[1:16:56] times if you want the word of God to
[1:16:59] take effect in your life now if you
[1:17:01] don't want it okay then carry on and
[1:17:04] good luck with that but if but if you're
[1:17:07] here today and you want God's
[1:17:10] righteousness and you want to be an
[1:17:12] overcomer then I'm telling you it's
[1:17:14] going to require you to say today I will
[1:17:18] take every word no matter what it is and
[1:17:21] no matter what it says and no matter
[1:17:23] what it costs me
[1:17:26] and I won't just mentally believe it
[1:17:28] I'll go out of here and put wheels to it
[1:17:30] and I'll move it up the highway in faith
[1:17:34] I'll actually do it you must hear and
[1:17:37] recognize and act upon the word of God
[1:17:41] he sends it to be believed and lived he
[1:17:45] doesn't send the message to give us
[1:17:47] better Doctrine come on then manage
[1:17:50] thinkers amen he gives us an eagle
[1:17:53] anointing so we can get off the Earth
[1:17:56] Hallelujah so you have to begin by
[1:17:59] agreeing with God's word for every
[1:18:01] aspect of your life and what it's
[1:18:03] directing you to do what it's what it's
[1:18:06] calling for you to remove from your life
[1:18:09] and your activities it might lead you to
[1:18:13] a reconsideration of the friends you
[1:18:16] have the relationships you may be in
[1:18:20] your goals in life even your career path
[1:18:25] amen see which could need changing amen
[1:18:29] your friends might need changing your
[1:18:31] relationships might need changing your
[1:18:33] career path might need changing amen
[1:18:36] see the Holy Ghost can lead you and and
[1:18:40] and let me just say it like this the
[1:18:43] Holy Ghost can only lead you to the
[1:18:47] vision that God had of you before the
[1:18:50] foundation of the world Amen and there's
[1:18:53] no getting around that and that's that's
[1:18:55] unequivocal he can only lead you he can
[1:18:59] only lead you I want to say it like that
[1:19:03] he can only lead you with the vision
[1:19:06] that God had of you before the
[1:19:08] foundation of the world and he will not
[1:19:12] deviate from that for no one amen
[1:19:17] see frankly the bottom line is that as I
[1:19:21] said before he just loves you too much
[1:19:24] sometimes to allow the path of life or
[1:19:26] the elements in your life uh that you
[1:19:29] have chosen and you know I mean if you
[1:19:32] look back in the Old Testament even even
[1:19:35] things that you can see that when they
[1:19:37] got time to cross over under
[1:19:40] Joshua how many believe we're crossing
[1:19:42] over under
[1:19:43] Joshua that's the Holy Ghost take taking
[1:19:45] us in the promised land we realize
[1:19:47] that's the Holy Ghost but we also
[1:19:49] realize it's a it's it's a it's a it's a
[1:19:51] type of Crossing out of this world into
[1:19:53] a new world but I I get that brother Ram
[1:19:56] talks about they still had Wars and
[1:19:57] things so it's a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:58] not the Millennium not perfectly so so
[1:20:01] we find out the M the type of the
[1:20:03] Millennium came later under Solomon and
[1:20:06] so so so are you on your way to the
[1:20:09] Millennium well then let me tell you
[1:20:11] what happened to them when they were on
[1:20:12] their way see there were things in their
[1:20:16] life that Moses remember he was the
[1:20:18] meekest man on
[1:20:20] Earth wrote that himself about
[1:20:23] himself that there were things that
[1:20:25] Moses tolerated in the lives of the
[1:20:28] people that Joshua would not
[1:20:30] tolerate Joshua made them rededicate the
[1:20:34] whole Camp before they he would lead
[1:20:35] them
[1:20:36] across things that Moses allowed let me
[1:20:39] tell you something friends the closer we
[1:20:40] get to the
[1:20:43] Rapture of the thing that God required
[1:20:46] there was an
[1:20:47] increase it wasn't a time to go easy and
[1:20:50] move the ancient landmarks there wasn't
[1:20:52] a it wasn't a time to take the message
[1:20:55] that brought them out of Egypt and water
[1:20:57] it
[1:20:58] down it was a time to rededicate and
[1:21:04] reconsecrate as we get closer to
[1:21:06] crossing over the anointing from Heaven
[1:21:09] is here to establish the same standards
[1:21:13] of godliness because your type is Enoch
[1:21:16] yeah amen who walked with God and had
[1:21:20] this testimony that he pleased God and
[1:21:23] then God took him he was not because God
[1:21:27] took
[1:21:28] him brother brandham says now everything
[1:21:31] I've just said I'm going to prove to you
[1:21:34] in this
[1:21:36] quote in 1961 and brother brandham is
[1:21:39] preaching on the Book of Revelation
[1:21:40] chapter 4 part three and he's talking
[1:21:43] about chiefly coming to the new birth
[1:21:46] but as I said it's demon demonstrated
[1:21:50] that this is a an eternal principle
[1:21:52] before during and after the New Birth if
[1:21:54] you you want victory in your
[1:21:56] life and he says the only way that you
[1:21:58] can get this thing fixed in here is your
[1:22:02] own self
[1:22:07] will
[1:22:08] Hallelujah and he repeats himself your
[1:22:12] self-will W you have to will to do God's
[1:22:18] will
[1:22:21] good you have to get rid rid of your own
[1:22:25] will wow to let God's will come in amen
[1:22:30] for this is the only channel that leads
[1:22:33] to the
[1:22:36] heart so if you need a nature change you
[1:22:39] and you've never had it but you need it
[1:22:42] then you've got to be able to say Lord
[1:22:44] from today not my will come into my
[1:22:46] heart change my whole life and if that's
[1:22:48] already happened to you and you're a
[1:22:50] Believer today but you want to live
[1:22:52] overcoming and you wonder exactly why
[1:22:54] you can't You' got to say Lord change my
[1:22:57] will I'm going to empty out me so that
[1:23:00] you can be
[1:23:03] more this is in fact a greatly
[1:23:05] overlooked element in my view in the
[1:23:08] power of transformation and is precisely
[1:23:12] why although you may have a new
[1:23:15] birth this is precisely
[1:23:18] why even with the new birth and your
[1:23:22] continued growth this is exactly why God
[1:23:27] cannot and will not as a prophet taught
[1:23:30] push you through a
[1:23:32] pipe or a form or a mold amen and then
[1:23:37] you know push you through a form and
[1:23:38] shape you pour you into a mold take you
[1:23:40] out push you through a you know
[1:23:42] something and then pull you out and say
[1:23:44] oh what a wonderful Overcomer he's not
[1:23:46] going to push you through a a a forming
[1:23:49] pipe called an overcomer pipe he doesn't
[1:23:51] have a mold that says I'm just going to
[1:23:53] pour you in into it and let you dry and
[1:23:55] open up you'll be an overcomer that's
[1:23:57] not how it
[1:23:58] works see you've got a you've got a a
[1:24:02] part to play in this you've got to be
[1:24:05] willing to get things out of your life
[1:24:07] and get things out of your home and get
[1:24:08] things out you've got to be willing to
[1:24:10] change those friends if he needs you to
[1:24:13] change those relationships if he needs
[1:24:15] you to change that career path if he
[1:24:17] needs you
[1:24:19] to amen amen praise the Lord you know
[1:24:23] did you just notice why I didn't stop
[1:24:26] when someone went out because that's a
[1:24:28] pregnant lady who needs to go out but
[1:24:32] teenagers don't need to be running in
[1:24:33] and out amen see don't do that stop
[1:24:39] doing that amen am little
[1:24:45] sweeties thank you brother Luther it's
[1:24:48] awesome when the next hit man still
[1:24:50] loves you
[1:24:57] hallelujah amen don't make sister
[1:24:59] Melissa shout
[1:25:03] amen so so this is a greatly overlooked
[1:25:06] element in the whole power of
[1:25:08] transformation because a lot of times
[1:25:10] people have have repented and and they
[1:25:12] have offered their hearts to the Lord
[1:25:14] Jesus and they are True Believers of
[1:25:17] every word of God for this hour amen but
[1:25:21] day after day their their Earthly
[1:25:23] Journey and I and and there's been I I I
[1:25:26] can I can so relate to what I wrote
[1:25:30] myself cuz I can I can I can painfully
[1:25:34] remember times when this was me I can
[1:25:36] painfully painfully remember times when
[1:25:38] this is too close to me now yes amen see
[1:25:42] but we find that sometimes day after day
[1:25:45] even as Believers our Earthly journey
[1:25:47] and our service to the Lord we have
[1:25:50] sometimes such struggles in our flesh
[1:25:52] and we wonder why yes amen we wonder why
[1:25:56] the power of transformation does not
[1:25:58] seem to do its Supernatural work in
[1:26:02] us we read stories of other great people
[1:26:05] and the power of God that made them
[1:26:08] Overcomers don't don't lose sight of the
[1:26:10] fact friends that you're living in an
[1:26:12] impossible age and you're living in a
[1:26:15] time where it's so wicked and it's so
[1:26:17] evil I'm just so glad there's such a
[1:26:20] Grace that can still look at my life and
[1:26:22] it can still say grace and grace and
[1:26:25] grace and grace in fact is it is his
[1:26:28] constant Grace that causes me to want to
[1:26:31] be an overcomer even
[1:26:33] more
[1:26:36] see and then of course then Satan comes
[1:26:39] along and uh and he and he whispers to
[1:26:42] that person that well it's because the
[1:26:44] word isn't true or it's because the
[1:26:47] message isn't true or it's or it's
[1:26:49] because well the supernatural doesn't
[1:26:51] work like that anymore and even if it
[1:26:53] does it doesn't work like that
[1:26:57] see but the real problem friends the the
[1:27:01] the real problem is not that the
[1:27:03] Supernatural is just a myth the real
[1:27:05] problem is within the person yes amen
[1:27:09] and it begins with a refusal to
[1:27:12] surrender to the will of God's word at
[1:27:16] the onset of hearing it amen amen and
[1:27:20] I'm talking about something as simple as
[1:27:23] you said in church and you hear anointed
[1:27:25] preaching I've been right there and had
[1:27:28] the Lord come across the pull pit from a
[1:27:31] preacher who knows nothing that I'm in
[1:27:33] that struggle with that certain thing
[1:27:35] and the Lord is saying the reason you're
[1:27:37] struggling is because this is feeding it
[1:27:39] if you get rid of these you wouldn't
[1:27:40] have that struggle and then I got to
[1:27:43] make a decision will I get rid of them
[1:27:44] or will I not and it's really that
[1:27:48] simple it's not rocket science to be an
[1:27:51] overcomer you're already halfway there
[1:27:53] with the New Birth you already got a
[1:27:56] head start on the devil Stop Believing
[1:27:58] his lie that you can't give those things
[1:28:01] up you can amen and then when you're
[1:28:04] willing to then the supernatural power
[1:28:06] will give you the ability to keep them
[1:28:09] out of your
[1:28:12] life so when you sit under anointed
[1:28:14] Ministry year after year but you're
[1:28:16] simply not willing to accept and follow
[1:28:20] God's instructions from his word with
[1:28:22] all of your heart whether that comes
[1:28:25] from hearing the scriptures read reading
[1:28:28] them yourself whether it comes from a a
[1:28:31] message book or or whether he sent a or
[1:28:34] the fact that you listen to a Vindicated
[1:28:36] Prophet or or a Vindicated Pastor the
[1:28:39] power of transformation that comes from
[1:28:41] the Holy Ghost it cannot have full
[1:28:45] controlling power in your life he wants
[1:28:48] that yes amen but you're blocking it
[1:28:52] amen wow amen
[1:28:54] amen and I've heard some people say well
[1:28:57] it's because they're not born again I'm
[1:28:59] living evidence that's not true not in
[1:29:02] every case it might be true it's not
[1:29:04] true in me I've had times where I
[1:29:06] wouldn't listen to his voice and paid a
[1:29:08] price but I knew I was born again I knew
[1:29:10] I'd pass from Death to life because I
[1:29:12] have no more conscience of sin all my
[1:29:14] desire for the world is gone I don't
[1:29:16] even desire to desire it I desire to not
[1:29:19] desire it I desire to be free of
[1:29:21] it amen there's no workarounds for this
[1:29:25] friend I'm going to read it again the
[1:29:27] only way you can get this thing fixed in
[1:29:30] here is your own self-will Hallelujah
[1:29:32] your self- willll you have to will to do
[1:29:35] God's will you have to get rid of your
[1:29:37] own will to let God's will come in for
[1:29:40] this is the only channel that leads to
[1:29:42] the heart 19 then a year later 1962 the
[1:29:45] spoken word is Original Seed now others
[1:29:48] will go by and say well you know what I
[1:29:50] believe I'll try it a
[1:29:53] while he says you'll
[1:29:55] choke I believe I'll try it a while I'm
[1:29:59] going to give that a
[1:30:00] try you'll choke
[1:30:03] amen but when you
[1:30:06] really empty out amen wow when you
[1:30:11] really empty out say Lord Jesus no more
[1:30:17] me but you from this on then it's going
[1:30:22] to bring forth a 100 F
[1:30:26] amen he comes about 8 months later in
[1:30:29] the message
[1:30:31] dedication and if we if we'll come back
[1:30:34] to the original
[1:30:35] dedication and we'll open our heart now
[1:30:39] he's talking to Believers people who are
[1:30:42] born again of the spirit and he's saying
[1:30:44] if we'll come back to the original
[1:30:46] dedication and we'll open our hearts and
[1:30:48] here it is again empty
[1:30:50] ourselves God in dedication as we give
[1:30:53] it to him as we give it to him as we
[1:30:57] give it to him will fill our temple with
[1:31:01] his
[1:31:04] shise God that's
[1:31:08] me Glory he says then the Living God
[1:31:14] then the Living God will be moving in a
[1:31:18] Living Church among a living people and
[1:31:21] it will spread forth his glory then
[1:31:23] you'll be a witness to Nations and
[1:31:25] peoples and kings and tongues because
[1:31:28] now we find out that it's a living God
[1:31:31] in a Living Church living in living
[1:31:35] people amen and that's when it'll spread
[1:31:37] forth his
[1:31:42] glory that wonderful anointing that we
[1:31:45] feel from the word of God settling in on
[1:31:48] this bride and creating in her and I
[1:31:51] know you have an affinity with this it
[1:31:54] it seems like every day and I've had the
[1:31:57] testimony of so many people even
[1:31:59] recently that that testify to a to a
[1:32:02] deepening to a to a growing desire to be
[1:32:06] lifted up you know uh into this new day
[1:32:09] that we see Dawning we we sense that the
[1:32:12] that the change is coming we sense that
[1:32:15] the age is about to recycle we sense
[1:32:18] that this Earth is passing away this
[1:32:19] world's order is passing away we sense
[1:32:22] that there's going to be a marriage
[1:32:23] supper and
[1:32:24] soon we sense that Moses and Elijah are
[1:32:27] ready to go to Israel we sense that the
[1:32:30] Saints are ready for hundreds of years
[1:32:32] oh come back among us and we sense that
[1:32:34] nearness I'm here to tell you friends I
[1:32:36] sense it I trust you sense it and
[1:32:39] there's a deepening anointing that is
[1:32:41] calling for a greater dedication a
[1:32:44] greater
[1:32:45] consecration that's why the Holy Spirit
[1:32:48] has been has has even preached this
[1:32:50] whole series and we've dealt so much
[1:32:52] with the token
[1:32:55] and it's not hardship amen as I said uh
[1:32:59] one or two uh sermons ago you know and
[1:33:02] it's not because of promised Treasures I
[1:33:05] I you know I read a long time ago an
[1:33:08] advice from U from a theology professor
[1:33:11] and he was counseling young ministers
[1:33:14] and he said was almost like a sales
[1:33:17] pitch and he said if you ever want to
[1:33:20] have plenty of people to preach to he
[1:33:22] said just preach to Broken
[1:33:25] Hearts now that's there's not I'm not
[1:33:27] saying that's bad in and of itself I'm
[1:33:30] just simply saying that you can see in
[1:33:33] their mind that that psychological only
[1:33:36] approach that that doesn't really take
[1:33:39] in the real the real dynamics that can
[1:33:42] make Christian psychology live is the
[1:33:45] Holy
[1:33:46] Ghost it can make it in said Christian
[1:33:49] psychology that oh psychology psychology
[1:33:51] that's that's on tape that's brother
[1:33:53] ad's words he talks about things that
[1:33:56] are in the mind and psychology and
[1:33:58] things like that you know so we're not
[1:34:00] we're not saying that that stuff's not
[1:34:02] valid I'm just simply saying without the
[1:34:04] dynamic of the Holy Ghost that only has
[1:34:06] its it's like Brother JD said it's just
[1:34:08] training from the outside in but we're
[1:34:11] trying to get it from the inside
[1:34:13] out amen it's instructions on how to
[1:34:16] live instructions how to have a healthy
[1:34:18] marriage instructions on how to have a
[1:34:20] healthy home and children and church and
[1:34:23] a testimony so who could possibly be
[1:34:27] against that
[1:34:28] see so so it's it's not that I want to
[1:34:31] preach to Broken Hearts it's not about I
[1:34:34] it's not because we're here today and oh
[1:34:37] I just want to go to heaven because I
[1:34:40] have such hardships and I have such
[1:34:42] trials and oh poor me and oh I just need
[1:34:45] out and it's not that amen nor is it
[1:34:49] like glory to God streets of gold walls
[1:34:51] of Jasper mansion on the hillside Liv in
[1:34:53] a palace fly like jump Cloud to cloud
[1:34:55] like Super Mario right
[1:35:00] your it's none of that I'm I'm quite
[1:35:03] sure I'll love our Dwelling Place amen
[1:35:07] but it's not about hardship wanting out
[1:35:10] it's not about Treasures unseen it's
[1:35:12] about a land where everything is
[1:35:14] Holiness and everything is righteousness
[1:35:17] and everything is clean and everything
[1:35:19] is pure and Satan is Bound for a
[1:35:21] thousand years
[1:35:23] [Music]
[1:35:24] amen and we can walk freely through the
[1:35:27] Earth and love and love one another and
[1:35:30] never have to worry be in a body
[1:35:33] impervious to
[1:35:36] Temptation see so it's a deepening
[1:35:40] desire for righteousness and Purity and
[1:35:43] and and I'll just tell you something
[1:35:44] friends you know and I and if this is
[1:35:46] you I I I I'm gonna pray harder for you
[1:35:49] I mean you might be here today and here
[1:35:52] I am talking about this this deepening
[1:35:54] this anointing and and you might not
[1:35:56] sense it at all but I just want to say
[1:35:58] to you it's all around you it's around
[1:36:01] you right now some brother Brown talks
[1:36:03] about people raising their hand
[1:36:04] sometimes we he would say how many want
[1:36:06] me to pray for you raise your hand he
[1:36:08] said and he talks about how raise up
[1:36:10] that hand up into those Angelic
[1:36:12] atmospheres almost like an antenna plug
[1:36:14] you into the supernatural give you what
[1:36:16] you
[1:36:17] need amen those things are real a
[1:36:19] prophet saw into those Realms he knew
[1:36:22] those anointings moving across he he
[1:36:24] talks in one place where you turn around
[1:36:26] in a great anointed meeting and this is
[1:36:28] a total paraphrase I remember brother
[1:36:29] Matt uh Watkins talking about it
[1:36:31] sometime and he said you you turn around
[1:36:33] and bump into somebody and turn around
[1:36:35] and nobody's there he said you don't
[1:36:36] realize just bumped into an angel who's
[1:36:38] moving up and down passing out
[1:36:41] blessings I just say come on up here
[1:36:43] Lord move up here move in these aisles
[1:36:46] move among these people
[1:36:50] hallelujah it's all around you brother
[1:36:52] brandham says in Christ is the mystery
[1:36:54] of God
[1:36:56] revealed this is if you're born again
[1:36:58] this is a true statement about you why
[1:37:00] do you hunger Church yes why do you
[1:37:04] thirst it's the father trying to reveal
[1:37:08] this hidden secret to you

[1:37:14] preaching I'm preaching this hidden
[1:37:16] secret that it's here now and it's
[1:37:18] happening in real time and you can be a
[1:37:21] part of it see he says why do you thirst
[1:37:24] it's the why do you hunger it's the
[1:37:26] father trying to reveal this hidden
[1:37:28] secret to you now you're going to find

[1:37:32] here it is you want me to go ahead and
[1:37:33] give you the secret at the end of the
[1:37:34] paragraph the last day is
[1:37:37] here that's the

[1:37:46] father trying to reveal this hidden
[1:37:49] secret to you but you born again people
[1:37:52] who love the Lord with the gene of God

[1:38:15] hungering it's God trying to reveal it
[1:38:19] to you see the Revelation the last day
[1:38:23] is here amen now it's not just limited
[1:38:27] to that it's the whole revelation of
[1:38:28] Jesus Christ and and that that indicates
[1:38:32] to you the last day is here because that
[1:38:34] was a promised restoration when it was
[1:38:37] the last day
[1:38:39] amen and there's no substitute I want to
[1:38:42] say to you today that there is no
[1:38:44] substitute of this world Amen that will
[1:38:48] give you that kind of
[1:38:50] fulfillment that the Life of Christ
[1:38:52] brings
[1:38:54] amen Paul sums it up well Zoe let's go
[1:38:57] to Ephesians chapter 2 I'm quickly
[1:39:00] Running Out of
[1:39:02] Time Ephesians chapter 2 Paul sums it up
[1:39:06] well beginning in verse
[1:39:08] 4 but God who is rich in
[1:39:13] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:39:16] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[1:39:20] hath quickened us together with Christ
[1:39:23] by Grace you are saved amen and hath
[1:39:27] raised us up together and made us to sit
[1:39:30] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[1:39:34] in Christ Jesus now here's why he did
[1:39:37] it here here's the here's what's behind
[1:39:40] it all that in the ages to come he might
[1:39:44] show the exceeding Riches of his grace
[1:39:48] in his kindness toward us through Christ
[1:39:52] Jesus amen see so there's a purpose
[1:39:58] behind so that so that so that we should
[1:40:02] not allow Satan now Paul is is giving
[1:40:05] you who you are this is your identity
[1:40:10] he's got a great love by which he loved
[1:40:12] us even when we he loved us even when we
[1:40:16] were dead in sins and trespasses and he
[1:40:18] hath quickened us together with Grace by
[1:40:23] grace or with Grace uh by grace are you
[1:40:26] saved and he ha he didn't stop there and
[1:40:29] he's raised us up together and made us
[1:40:32] sit together in Heavenly places in
[1:40:34] Christ Jesus and the whole purpose is so
[1:40:36] you can know who you are so you can know
[1:40:39] what the program is so you can get with
[1:40:41] it eat the book be a living testimony
[1:40:44] and and and understand who the bride is
[1:40:49] and and separate it clearly in your mind
[1:40:52] that this m message is not like any
[1:40:54] other message in the earth and this
[1:40:56] bride is not like the rest of the
[1:40:58] Christian World she's not like her in
[1:41:01] fact is with every day that that uh
[1:41:04] nominal Christian world gets further and
[1:41:06] further into ungodliness and we're
[1:41:08] getting higher and higher into
[1:41:11] righteousness the more distinction there
[1:41:16] is and we should never allow Satan to
[1:41:19] steal our identity in Christ amen
[1:41:23] because if the
[1:41:25] enemy if he can obscure who you are to
[1:41:30] you who you are why you're here and what
[1:41:34] you are to
[1:41:36] do and most importantly what you are to
[1:41:40] be amen amen if he can do
[1:41:45] that then you will
[1:41:47] never you'll never reach the
[1:41:51] level of living in the the image of God
[1:41:55] that you were made
[1:41:57] for placed here for you'll never get in
[1:42:02] the position to fulfill the words in
[1:42:06] Revelation 10 thou must prophesy again
[1:42:10] before many peoples and Nations and
[1:42:13] tongues and
[1:42:16] kings and that's what it comes down to
[1:42:19] today
[1:42:20] friends is that God has indeed sent us a
[1:42:24] word that can change our hearts change
[1:42:27] our lives change our minds am but you've
[1:42:30] got to be willing you've got to be
[1:42:33] willing brother brandham talks about in
[1:42:35] the restoration of the brid tree I don't
[1:42:36] have time to get to it today we're GNA
[1:42:38] going to hit a pause button here in a
[1:42:39] few
[1:42:41] minutes but brother Bram talks about in
[1:42:43] the restoration of the brid
[1:42:46] tree and that it is coming back and and
[1:42:49] I would say today not just is has amen
[1:42:53] where all all of the fruit is back in
[1:42:56] the top of the tree ripening in the
[1:42:59] presence of the Sun and I'm here to tell
[1:43:01] you something friends if the world has
[1:43:03] you thinking if the world has you
[1:43:06] thinking that it's just going to go on
[1:43:09] and on and on and on please don't fall
[1:43:14] for that delusional lie of the devil
[1:43:18] because the world around you is
[1:43:20] collapsing the world around you is in
[1:43:22] Anarchy the world around you uh Law and
[1:43:25] Order are F failing Justice is failing
[1:43:28] political uh uh thinking has failed
[1:43:31] governments have failed the church has
[1:43:33] failed families have failed it's it's a
[1:43:35] whole world filled with naked
[1:43:39] vulgarity and it and it's it has every
[1:43:42] sign that God said would be of perilous
[1:43:45] times and every description that was to
[1:43:47] be and not only just to be but to be
[1:43:50] loud and to be out there and to be at a
[1:43:53] high level of of men who are truce
[1:43:56] Breakers and false accusers and
[1:43:58] incontinent and Fierce and despisers of
[1:44:00] those that are good men and women who
[1:44:02] are heady high-minded lovers of pleasure
[1:44:05] more than they are lovers of
[1:44:08] God this is what this is why you exactly
[1:44:11] why you find in nominal churches their
[1:44:15] their the the the vulgarity of even
[1:44:18] their worship services that go on and
[1:44:21] the vulgarity of how they live and how
[1:44:23] they conduct themselves I was reading
[1:44:25] the other day somebody posted and and I
[1:44:28] and I and I thought you know I I'm while
[1:44:31] at the same time this person you know
[1:44:33] the unbeliever is just going to find
[1:44:35] reasons to
[1:44:36] unbelieve the heathen's going to rage
[1:44:38] the heathen's always going to rage
[1:44:39] you're not going to stop him you know
[1:44:41] even God ask the question why does the
[1:44:43] Heathen rage you know and so and the
[1:44:46] question is almost rhetorical because
[1:44:48] God is basically saying it ain't going
[1:44:49] to do you no good you know you're not
[1:44:52] going to overthrow me why why you rage
[1:44:54] you know why why will you die he asked
[1:44:57] some people he asked his own Nation why
[1:44:58] will you die why why will you not come
[1:45:02] to me and live Jesus comes around and
[1:45:04] identifies himself with that same being
[1:45:06] who asked Israel that from above through
[1:45:08] a prophet Jesus comes in the flesh and
[1:45:10] says you won't come to me that you might
[1:45:12] receive life he's the same one back
[1:45:14] there said why why will you not come to
[1:45:16] me see so so so we we see these patterns
[1:45:21] in the world friends and and we realize
[1:45:24] that it's passing away and the reason
[1:45:26] that you see the degradation in nominal
[1:45:29] Christianity is you say but they love
[1:45:32] God uh
[1:45:33] yes they
[1:45:35] do the problem is they're lovers of
[1:45:38] pleasure more than lovers of
[1:45:42] God remember I said to you there's a a
[1:45:45] grand there's a Grand Canyon siiz
[1:45:48] difference between having a love for God
[1:45:51] and having the love of God those are not
[1:45:55] even in the same ballpark having a love
[1:45:58] for God people have wonderful warm fuzzy
[1:46:00] thoughts about God and they talk about
[1:46:02] him and they they sing songs about him
[1:46:05] and I'm not against that I'm not against
[1:46:06] those people maybe they've just never
[1:46:08] heard the message of the hour we you
[1:46:10] should pray if you love them and you
[1:46:13] want to try to help them then you've got
[1:46:15] a commission to eat the book and become
[1:46:17] the book and then you can testify to
[1:46:20] Nations and peoples and tongues and
[1:46:22] kings then you can be an effective
[1:46:24] witness but you're never going to be an
[1:46:26] effective
[1:46:27] witness if you sit in a message church
[1:46:30] year after year after year and the word
[1:46:33] of God calls for elements in your life
[1:46:35] that need to go and you won't obey that
[1:46:39] you you are never going to get to the
[1:46:41] top of the mountain because you are
[1:46:42] breaking the First Fundamental
[1:46:45] rule that is the foundation the
[1:46:47] foundation of getting to the top of the
[1:46:49] pyramid is Faith amen you've got to to
[1:46:53] believe and accept every word even if
[1:46:55] you can't muster the strength to do it
[1:46:58] you've still got to acknowledge it own
[1:47:00] it and say Lord God help me Lord God
[1:47:04] help me how many want to do that today
[1:47:06] say Lord I I I I I'm weak but Thou Art
[1:47:10] strong and the Bible says let let the
[1:47:12] redeemed of the Lord say so let the weak
[1:47:15] say I'm strong amen I'm not going to
[1:47:18] keep giving credit to the devil I
[1:47:20] already the devil tells me I got this
[1:47:22] weakness and that one no kidding I
[1:47:24] already know that but I also got a word
[1:47:26] that promised me I could be an overcomer
[1:47:29] I've already been converted I've already
[1:47:31] passed from Death to life and I already
[1:47:33] have an anointing coalescing around me
[1:47:36] that's Lifting me
[1:47:39] Higher and I want that in my life friend
[1:47:43] I want that in my life let's stand to
[1:47:45] our

[1:48:31] Lord I stand here and I I have a little
[1:48:34] better understanding

[1:48:44] manipulate it Lord I've waited months to
[1:48:47] get to a certain part of the material
[1:48:51] and you've held me back yet again today
[1:48:54] oddly strangely to my own mind but yet
[1:48:58] at the same time Spirit now enough's
[1:49:00] been said and hearts are open and evil
[1:49:03] spirits are driven back so that Faith
[1:49:05] Can
[1:49:07] strike Lord I commit this audience into
[1:49:10] your hands this audience who are here
[1:49:13] today have come here they've listened to
[1:49:18] the foolishness of
[1:49:20] preaching they've sat patiently and kind
[1:49:22] L Lord and they pulled on the word of
[1:49:24] God now would you reward them Lord
[1:49:27] reward them for their obedience to come
[1:49:30] to your house because the word says that
[1:49:32] you ought to do
[1:49:34] that would you reward them Lord for
[1:49:37] their patience and their diligence to
[1:49:40] say Amen to the word and to make the
[1:49:42] Holy Spirit feel welcome to make me feel
[1:49:45] like I had a liberty to
[1:49:47] preach Lord I'm committing them into
