[3:27] you
[4:14] good morning god bless you amen
[4:16] let's open our bibles and stand and
[4:20] we'll just have one verse here to read
[4:23] we are continuing in our study on the
[4:29] entire book of Revelation so where we're
[4:34] going to take this for the next while
[4:36] until we go through the whole book so
[4:39] greetings to the larger audience who are
[4:42] streaming today just a reminder that we
[4:45] don't we're not allowing a live audience
[4:48] there are a few people here brother
[4:51] Tommy's with us again visiting amen and
[4:53] we have our officers here and our booth
[4:56] crew sister Debbie of course follows me
[4:58] around everywhere I go so she's here
[5:00] today so I sure I'm happy to see her
[5:02] here in church she's missed a number of
[5:04] services from the illness I want to
[5:07] thank everybody for their prayers and
[5:09] I'll probably do that again when I come
[5:11] out for the regular service let's look
[5:13] in verse 1 of Revelation chapter 1 it's
[5:18] a simple verse it's very straightforward
[5:20] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[5:24] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[5:27] things which must shortly come to pass
[5:30] and he sent and signified it by his
[5:33] angel unto his servant John let's pray
[5:37] father we thank you for your word Lord
[5:40] we realized that there is a blessing and
[5:43] reading it there's a blessing and even
[5:45] even hearing it read so master we commit
[5:49] it now to you of all days
[5:50] Lord now that I'm in this study lord I
[5:54] really trusting in you as you always do
[5:58] Lord come on the scene in a in a special
[6:01] way for teaching and help me Lord to
[6:04] stay in that frame as I've thought about
[6:07] it quite a bit and father I commit
[6:10] myself into your hands for service now
[6:12] completely yours now in Jesus name Amen
[6:16] god bless you friends as you're seated
[6:19] so we started in last
[6:25] Sunday on this series and we took a
[6:31] title of low resolution versus high
[6:36] resolution or low res versus high res
[6:39] and we were just explaining some
[6:41] fundamental principles about the book of
[6:44] Revelation it is apocalypsis and it
[6:47] simply means an uncovering it is not a
[6:50] new creation it is something that is
[6:53] there but it is shrouded in mystery it's
[6:56] locked it's encoded it's encrypted and
[7:01] even things that there were certain
[7:04] points within the book John having been
[7:07] given a commission to write everything
[7:09] that he saw and heard comes to a certain
[7:11] point in the seventh under mystery and
[7:14] because that that is related to the
[7:18] coming of the Lord then John was told
[7:21] don't write what you heard about that he
[7:23] can write everything else but don't
[7:25] write that because that pertained to the
[7:29] coming of the Lord in his second coming
[7:31] and even Jesus was very silent on that
[7:36] if you go into the Gospels and he begins
[7:38] to talk about and parallel his cut what
[7:42] will happen in history and what will
[7:44] happen in Matthew 24 at the end of the
[7:47] world then he he jumps over his coming
[7:50] is a great mystery when they asked Jesus
[7:53] on the Mount of Olives concerning the
[7:56] establishment of the kingdom he won't
[7:58] answer the question he says the father
[8:00] has that that's up to him and he has
[8:04] that in his own time but you shall
[8:07] receive power after that you this Holy
[8:10] Spirit comes upon you because what God
[8:12] was intending was to create a church
[8:15] that would span unbeknownst to that
[8:18] group at that day it would end up
[8:20] spanning 2,000 years through seven
[8:24] Church ages and so the book of
[8:27] Revelation is an amazing book it is the
[8:31] brides book particularly for the endtime
[8:34] I want to make that statement going in
[8:37] this is a book that
[8:38] was brought to the church even after
[8:42] Paul was already gone and so he never
[8:45] read the book of Revelation and John
[8:48] brought it back locked up and there was
[8:51] no promise that it would be revealed in
[8:53] that day it was promised to the church
[8:56] that it would be revealed at the end
[8:57] days now to them they probably were
[9:01] looking for it every day just like they
[9:03] were looking for his coming every day we
[9:05] are looking for his coming every day but
[9:08] it encourages my heart to see that God
[9:11] kept his promise and has opened up and
[9:14] unlocked the book of Revelation in this
[9:17] last day it is a sign to the bride that
[9:20] her homegoing is soon it is it also a
[9:24] harbinger to the world a harbinger of
[9:27] doom I'm afraid for those who miss the
[9:32] catching away the sudden secret catching
[9:35] away of the church the his bride so we
[9:39] realized that the church corporate the
[9:42] remnant of the woman's seed she ends up
[9:45] in the tribulation you can read it very
[9:47] clearly that's why many scholars
[9:50] mistakingly believed that everyone goes
[9:55] through the tribulation and indeed the
[9:58] church does the remnant of the woman's
[10:00] seed does the 144,000 elected Jews do
[10:05] but the bride does not go through the
[10:08] rep the tribulation because the
[10:09] tribulation is a time of judgment and
[10:12] the bride who are born again of the
[10:14] Spirit of God are already judged in
[10:16] Christ at Calvary and that's why Jesus
[10:19] could confidently report to that
[10:21] redeemed family that in st. John 5:24
[10:25] when you believe on him you pass from
[10:28] death to life you will never come into
[10:30] the condemnation you'll never come in to
[10:32] the judgment we can find imagery of it
[10:36] in the book of Revelation the Bible
[10:39] talks about how that the the sea gave up
[10:41] its dead and all the dead both small and
[10:43] great stood before him the heavens fled
[10:46] over the skies and heavens fled away
[10:47] like a scroll and the dead both small
[10:50] and great stew
[10:52] before him Matthew 25 gives us a
[10:55] wonderful rendering of it we find that
[10:58] he's a king judging on the throne he
[11:02] he's judging people who some at that
[11:05] moment will receive eternal life and
[11:08] some who will be sent to everlasting
[11:11] destruction we realized that the bride
[11:14] the elect family of God those who were
[11:17] born again by the spirit are not
[11:18] standing in front of that judgment bar
[11:20] they are seated with Christ they are
[11:23] sheep of his fold and Jesus promised
[11:27] them promised all the overcomers that
[11:29] you would be granted to sit with him in
[11:32] his throne so we're not going to be
[11:34] judged before his throne I will not I'm
[11:36] not part of the of the second
[11:39] resurrection I'm part of the first
[11:41] resurrection the same resurrection that
[11:44] brought him out of the grave and brought
[11:46] the Old Testament Saints out of the
[11:48] grave who would believed with true faith
[11:50] and so we find then that this book of
[11:54] Revelation is a great book and you know
[11:57] it's it it's it's amazing when we began
[12:02] to study the book of Revelation that
[12:04] you're going to have to understand some
[12:07] principles going in before we start
[12:10] breaking down the symbology because it's
[12:12] a book of symbols and they all have a
[12:14] meaning and every word has a meaning and
[12:16] a place and it has an order you cannot
[12:19] read it like a newspaper that is that
[12:22] has caused more error because people
[12:24] read it linearly like a newspaper page
[12:27] one page two page three chapter one
[12:29] chapter two chapter three chapter 7
[12:31] chapter 8 9 10 11 12 and you're gonna
[12:33] find that many chapters come up go
[12:36] actually and have a fulfillment before
[12:38] the previous chapter and then then
[12:41] there's an interlocking and then this
[12:43] one ends up back over here and this
[12:44] one's back over here and you find that
[12:46] all through the book of Revelation
[12:48] that's why the only one who could reveal
[12:51] it was Christ himself and he promised
[12:54] that he would do that at the last days
[12:56] that he would raise up a messenger his
[12:58] seventh seventh star as part of the
[13:01] seven messengers to the seven churches
[13:03] and that seventh angel
[13:05] messenger an earthly nada not a heavenly
[13:08] angel an earthly angel a prophetic
[13:11] office would come and he would be
[13:13] standing on the earth and he would
[13:15] receive from the mighty angel which was
[13:18] Christ the open book which is this book
[13:21] open and made alive now you're going to
[13:24] find and and then then there comes the
[13:27] question well how can we know how can we
[13:31] have confidence in this prophets
[13:33] understanding and teaching of the book
[13:36] of Revelation how do we know that he's
[13:39] accurate we know the same way he knew
[13:42] that when the revelation came to him he
[13:45] went back into the Bible from Genesis to
[13:47] Revelation and checked it by the word
[13:50] and if it didn't dovetail with the word
[13:53] it's wrong it has to dovetail every
[13:56] revelation that we uncover and that we
[13:59] will uncover that have been brought to
[14:02] us in this endtime day you will find as
[14:05] a student as you go along through the
[14:07] scriptures with me that you will find
[14:09] that it all agrees with all the
[14:12] scriptures now I'm taking this subtitle
[14:16] the revelation of Jesus Christ and I
[14:20] don't fuel advance for me brother Josh
[14:22] to the next slide I didn't pull up so
[14:24] it's a sealed book that you'll see here
[14:27] it says the revelation of st. John the
[14:30] Divine but it's actually that's somewhat
[14:33] of a misnomer because it makes it sound
[14:36] like that this was John's revelation
[14:38] John was merely the scribe to record
[14:41] everything that he saw and heard it is
[14:44] as it says in the very first verse the
[14:47] revelation of Jesus Christ it is the
[14:50] only book in the Bible that Jesus
[14:52] personally wrote himself and used a
[14:56] scribe to pen the words you have Paul
[14:59] writing the book of Romans he wrote
[15:00] first and second Corinthians where he
[15:02] goes all the way through and you have
[15:04] Jude writing an epistle you have John
[15:07] writing several Peter writing a couple
[15:09] this is one that Jesus wrote and so he
[15:12] uses John to be his scribe he's recumbit
[15:17] from the his prison island of
[15:19] after being there two years he's the
[15:22] last living apostle he's the only one
[15:24] who dies a natural of natural causes
[15:27] they tried to kill him they tried to
[15:29] boil him in oil they couldn't do it
[15:32] because the laws of nature worked in his
[15:35] behalf just like a submarine goes to the
[15:39] depths of the sea and it's not crushed
[15:41] though the though the the the metric
[15:44] tonnes per square centimetre on the hull
[15:47] of that sub are so great the metal
[15:49] itself could not withstand it and the
[15:51] metal would crush but the sub is
[15:53] pressurized from the inside so there's
[15:56] more pressure pushing out than there is
[15:58] pressure pushing in and thus it doesn't
[16:00] get crushed
[16:01] John was boiled in hot boiling oil on
[16:05] the outside but John had a hotter
[16:08] boiling oil of the Holy Ghost on the
[16:10] inside and therefore the oil had no
[16:13] effect on him they believed in history
[16:16] that John bewitched the oil and so they
[16:19] put out his eyes but he didn't need eyes
[16:22] for this book because God would give him
[16:25] spiritual eyes that could see much
[16:28] better in fact is his natural sight
[16:32] would have very likely hindered some of
[16:35] what he saw but when you don't have eyes
[16:37] and you you get sight given to you by
[16:41] God you tend to believe what you see and
[16:43] so we find then that take me to my next
[16:48] slide brother
[16:50] Josh so here is our opening text of
[16:54] verse 1 and I want you to take this word
[16:58] here revelation by manifestation that's
[17:02] what we really want to focus in on today
[17:05] in this very first verse because you've
[17:08] got to settle the revelation of Jesus
[17:11] Christ who he is who he was who he is
[17:13] right now what he was doing in his first
[17:16] coming what he's been doing in the
[17:17] church what are his plans for now what
[17:20] are his plans for the world coming these
[17:22] things are all promised to be restored
[17:25] to the last day Church that in the days
[17:29] of the voice of the seventh angel that
[17:31] seventh star that's
[17:33] the messenger when he shall begin to
[17:35] sound the mystery of God should be
[17:37] finished in other words this last church
[17:39] is going to be given not a new mystery
[17:41] they're going to be restored back to the
[17:44] original mystery that the Apostles
[17:46] understood and then they're going to see
[17:49] a further manifestation because there
[17:52] were while it's not new teaching it you
[17:55] you learn by manifestation and the
[17:59] manifestation is the understanding it is
[18:02] the interpretation as as God had said
[18:05] through the Prophet a virgin shall
[18:07] conceive schools of theology argued for
[18:10] seven centuries but when God got ready
[18:13] to interpret the meaning of that he
[18:15] brought it to pass and a virgin
[18:17] conceived and bore child board the Holy
[18:20] Child Jesus and that manifestation was
[18:24] the interpretation it was the revelation
[18:28] of the prophecy and at the manifestation
[18:32] put all argument to rest they still
[18:34] argued against it then they still do
[18:37] today doesn't matter people can raise
[18:39] all kinds of arguments against the truth
[18:41] God doesn't need anybody's approval or
[18:44] their permission to reveal his word he
[18:48] doesn't take counsel the Bible teaches
[18:50] us even from himself because everything
[18:54] that he would ever know he Oh has always
[18:56] always has known and God cannot learn a
[19:00] new thing so he reveals himself all down
[19:05] through time by manifestation now that's
[19:09] that's real handy for you and I because
[19:13] we can see him doing that all through
[19:17] the pages of the Bible for instance we
[19:20] can we can come to the the message of
[19:26] this hour and we can say things like
[19:28] this is the seventh age we had the
[19:32] seventh messenger this is the time when
[19:35] we gain the ultimate victory and if you
[19:38] and it was it was the mighty angel who
[19:41] descended down with and to speak to an
[19:43] earthly messenger and it was the
[19:46] it will be the bride who actually
[19:49] finishes the manifestation the seventh
[19:51] messengers already came and gone but
[19:53] we're here and the mighty angel is still
[19:56] here and we have the word being
[19:58] interpreted to the world by the lives
[20:01] that we live and the ultimate
[20:04] interpretation of the rapture of the
[20:07] church will be our literal physical
[20:10] translation that is a Mount Zion
[20:13] showdown there was a Mount Carmel
[20:15] showdown there was there was Mount
[20:18] Transfiguration there is now going to be
[20:21] a Mount Zion showdown and people who
[20:24] take a body change are going to prove
[20:27] that that was always true what Paul said
[20:30] that we shall be changed in a moment in
[20:32] the twinkling of an eye people can argue
[20:35] about what that's going to be but when
[20:37] it happens that will be the
[20:39] interpretation and so you find that God
[20:42] does that now just you take that
[20:45] instance in all those sevens and an
[20:47] earthly man and a heavenly being and
[20:49] instructions for people you can go right
[20:52] back and and we're crossing into we sing
[20:55] the song Kanaan's land and now we
[20:57] realize Canaan's land in one sense
[21:00] doesn't represent the millennium because
[21:02] they were still fighting and killing and
[21:03] ret and there'll be no fighting and
[21:05] killing in the Millenium it represents
[21:07] in that regard the Holy Ghost the land
[21:10] of the Holy Ghost that we cross the
[21:12] Jordan that's death to self we're born
[21:15] again in the land in the promised land
[21:17] of the Holy Ghost however in a larger
[21:20] sense it certainly would it certainly
[21:23] would be the promised land of a
[21:25] millennial world that we are going to
[21:27] inhabit but how do we get there and if
[21:31] you look and see that Israel in their
[21:34] exodus had a prophet in our Exodus will
[21:38] have a prophet that that prophet led the
[21:41] people and it wasn't the Prophet that
[21:44] took the people across that prophet went
[21:46] home and there was another man Joshua
[21:51] who represents Jesus who represents the
[21:54] Holy Ghost who took the people across
[21:56] into the promised land and when we get
[21:58] over there
[21:59] you see all of these symbolisms now
[22:01] you've got a you've got orders to march
[22:04] on a city to do an impossible thing
[22:06] this was Jericho was unprecedented in
[22:09] its day Israel had never had to fight a
[22:11] battle like this in all their war
[22:13] campaigns they had never encountered an
[22:15] impregnable Citadel such as Jericho it
[22:18] was the most amazing Citadel in all the
[22:21] East at that time so they've got
[22:24] instructions going take it but they
[22:26] don't have any instructions on how
[22:28] they're going to do it so we find that
[22:30] Joshua is reconnoitering the area to
[22:36] figure out a battle plan when he sees a
[22:39] man dressed in armor now God had
[22:42] appeared in many forms he had appeared
[22:45] to Abraham as Melchizedek he had
[22:48] appeared to Abraham and the cool of the
[22:51] day as Abraham said in the tent the door
[22:53] of his tent and so he had appeared in
[22:55] all of these various forms he had
[22:57] appeared you know as an angel he had a
[23:01] appeared to Moses as a pillar of fire
[23:03] burning in a bush that didn't consume
[23:05] the bush but this is the first time that
[23:08] he's going to appear as a soldier and
[23:11] Joshua doesn't yet know who it is
[23:14] Joshua moves on him and with his sword
[23:17] ready to either fighting or welcome him
[23:21] and it doesn't matter to Joshua he's got
[23:23] a question are you for us or are you
[23:26] against us if you're for us great if
[23:28] you're against us you're dead and it's
[23:31] interesting that the soldier says to him
[23:34] I'm neither one I am the captain of the
[23:37] Lord's host so it's not about you know
[23:39] being for or against what what Josh was
[23:42] beginning to realize is this is in our
[23:45] fight after all this is his fight he's
[23:48] here to tell us how to do it
[23:50] interestingly enough the instructions
[23:52] seemed preposterous March around a city
[23:55] and come back and do it again the next
[23:59] day and be quiet and do it a third day
[24:02] and a fourth day and a fifth day and a
[24:04] sixth day and on the seventh day you'll
[24:07] on the seventh day you'll March around
[24:09] it seven times
[24:10] and then you'll blow a trumpet and then
[24:12] the walls will collapse and every man
[24:14] will take and go forward and these are
[24:16] the instructions that are given to him
[24:18] by this being who was nothing less than
[24:21] Almighty God now you know it was
[24:24] Almighty God because Joshua immediately
[24:27] fell down to worship Him
[24:29] he never tried to worship Moses he never
[24:32] never got confused on that he never
[24:35] tried to worship a man we don't worship
[24:37] a man we don't worship the Prophet we
[24:39] don't worship the messenger he has his
[24:41] place he completed his assignment he
[24:43] went home to glory but the one that's
[24:45] leading us who we worship is Christ the
[24:48] revealed word of this hour and so it is
[24:51] our mission to interpret that buyer
[24:54] lives to the world who thinks they
[24:57] understand him but according to prophecy
[24:59] there will be many false prophets who
[25:01] will deceive many it is the mission of
[25:03] God's bride to interpret his word
[25:06] correctly so that there is a accurate
[25:09] representation of his word now again how
[25:13] do we know it's true because everything
[25:16] that we teach dovetails with all the
[25:19] word if you'll notice that Joshua when
[25:22] this when this soldier says to him I'm
[25:25] the captain of the Lord's host there's
[25:28] no record that anything changed
[25:31] visually he didn't start glowing he
[25:35] didn't start levitating angels didn't
[25:38] appear around him he was still a soldier
[25:41] standing there but by the word he spoke
[25:45] alone with no other visible sign his
[25:49] word caught a revelation in Joshua's
[25:52] heart and Joshua fell to his knees and
[25:55] begin to worship this being who had
[25:58] revealed himself by the word because the
[26:02] word he gave matched what Joshua knew
[26:06] the Commission to be that God had
[26:09] promised I will take you over I will
[26:12] lead you I will place you he said that
[26:15] to Moses I have heard the cry of my
[26:18] people I have come down now so so Joshua
[26:22] knew
[26:23] that here he is ready to take a city
[26:25] you're gonna march around at seven times
[26:27] on the seventh day you're gonna march
[26:29] seven times on the seventh day and
[26:30] you're gonna blow a trumpet and you're
[26:32] gonna shout and you're gonna go forward
[26:34] and so we see then that that the that
[26:38] the imagery in the book of Revelation
[26:42] that we say here's a seventh messenger
[26:44] he was a seventh star he's one of the
[26:47] seven spirits and you can go back to
[26:50] look at Joshua and you can say wow that
[26:53] matches just like they had to defeat the
[26:56] enemy we've got to defeat the enemy
[26:58] they took Canaan's land we've got to
[27:00] take Canaan's land and you had an
[27:03] earthly messenger and and God appeared
[27:05] to him in a form today we had an earthly
[27:08] messenger and God appeared to him in a
[27:10] form the form of his word the form of
[27:12] the pillar of fire and then we see it
[27:15] manifesting in our lives and we see
[27:19] these words coming to life in our life
[27:22] that's how you know you have passed from
[27:26] death to life now so so this brings up
[27:30] manifestation this indicates to you when
[27:34] you can do that when you can go in the
[27:36] book of Revelation and then you can go
[27:38] back into the book of Exodus and then go
[27:41] back into the book of Genesis come
[27:42] forward into the Book of Isaiah flip
[27:44] over into the Gospels go forward into
[27:46] the epistles and you keep finding these
[27:48] dovetailing parallels dovetailing
[27:50] parallels then you realize that this is
[27:54] one book it's one book that's a big
[27:59] important point this is one book written
[28:02] by many authors over many hundreds of
[28:04] years and but it is one single book and
[28:08] because of that reason that it's one
[28:11] book then you cannot dismiss a single
[28:16] word of Saint Paul any more than you
[28:20] could dismiss a single word of Jesus of
[28:22] Nazareth
[28:22] you cannot dismiss a word of Jude any
[28:26] more than you could dismiss the words of
[28:27] Christ you cannot take anything that
[28:30] Peter taught anything that John taught
[28:33] anything that Paul taught you can
[28:36] play it at one against the other Jesus
[28:39] said you shall go Jesus gives his Church
[28:42] of prophecy you'll go into all the world
[28:45] you'll preach the gospel many will try
[28:47] to kill you thinking they're doing me a
[28:49] service they'll hate you for my sake but
[28:50] just remember they hated me first you'll
[28:53] have trials and tribulations he's
[28:55] prophesying but be of good cheer I've
[28:58] overcome the world in me without me you
[29:01] can do nothing in me then all things are
[29:03] possible so he says when you go you will
[29:06] teach all nations this was a prophecy
[29:08] you'll baptize them there was nobody
[29:10] there to baptize at that point he said
[29:12] this is something that's going to happen
[29:14] you'll go you'll teach all nations
[29:16] you'll baptize them in the name of the
[29:18] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[29:19] Ghost and then when the Holy Ghost fell
[29:22] on the church what did the church do
[29:25] they started manifesting the
[29:27] interpretation of the words of the Lord
[29:30] they brought prophecy into real time and
[29:33] they started baptizing people in the
[29:36] name of the Lord Jesus Christ everybody
[29:38] that was ever baptized in the Bible in
[29:41] the early church history is replete with
[29:43] the record they were all baptized in the
[29:46] name of the Lord no one was baptized
[29:49] under titles until the four hundred more
[29:52] than three hundred years after the death
[29:54] of John now why is that because the
[29:57] church became a manifestation of the
[30:00] words of Christ and their manifestation
[30:04] was the inerrant interpretation because
[30:08] Jesus never said used the titles
[30:10] he said because father son Holy Ghost
[30:13] her titles not names and the Catholic
[30:15] Church started that in the in the fourth
[30:18] century and they started baptizing in
[30:21] titles the early church never did that
[30:23] not one time you know brother Ernie
[30:26] Villanueva our good friend he does Bible
[30:28] mystery expose in foreign countries he's
[30:32] done it many many times and he's never
[30:34] lost money but every time he does a
[30:37] mystery Expo he has a room full of
[30:41] denominational doctors of theology with
[30:44] PhDs and brother Ernie says to them I
[30:47] have a check today for five thousand
[30:49] dollars and I will make it out to you or
[30:52] anyone who can find an instance in the
[30:54] Bible where anyone was ever baptized
[30:56] according to the titles of Matthew 28
[30:59] boy you talking about men going through
[31:01] their Bibles and brother Ernie standing
[31:04] there with the check he's never had to
[31:05] pay it out because there's not a single
[31:07] instance in the Bible you can't even
[31:09] find an instance in history they were
[31:11] all baptized in the name Lord what does
[31:13] that mean it means that the
[31:15] manifestation was the interpretation and
[31:19] so we realized that when you when you
[31:23] look at the Word of God now let me let
[31:25] me let me let me give you this last
[31:27] point before we have to close I got
[31:29] about two and a half minutes and I'm
[31:31] that puts me 5 minutes into my overtime
[31:33] my grace period but you find this
[31:37] principle and here's a big principle I'm
[31:39] going to leave you with that that the
[31:42] Word of God even though it comes from
[31:46] God that that word has has no efficacy
[31:53] until it's made manifest now what the
[31:58] Bible had prophesied that that when a
[32:03] virgin conceived that he would come with
[32:06] the ministry that would set captives at
[32:09] Liberty that it would open the prison
[32:11] doors and loosed men and women who were
[32:15] held in chains of bondage and that
[32:17] prophecy was a real prophecy from God
[32:20] through a prophet but it never had any
[32:23] fulfillment until Jesus is born he's now
[32:27] he's now the man he's now the he's the
[32:30] he's the manifestation of Isaiah's
[32:33] prophecy a virgin shall conceive that
[32:35] had no efficacy in the world a savior is
[32:39] born God is going to send a savior that
[32:42] had no power that had no effect on
[32:45] mankind every man that died still went
[32:49] to paradise he could not go into the
[32:51] presence of God even though the Prophet
[32:53] said that this virgin shall conceive and
[32:56] bear a son and it shall be Emmanuel and
[32:58] he shall be the savior of his people no
[33:00] one was getting saved until he was
[33:03] actually born until that word became
[33:06] flesh and then Jesus picks up the book
[33:09] and picked opens the scroll and he's and
[33:12] he reads that portion of Scripture the
[33:15] Lord the Spirit of God has anointed me
[33:17] to preach the gospel to to bring glad
[33:19] tidings to set at liberty them that are
[33:21] cost to to open the eyes of the blind
[33:24] now that word that had always been God's
[33:27] word now found power now found efficacy
[33:31] now found fulfillment it found it it's
[33:34] found its power to to do things in its
[33:39] manifestation form God said let there be
[33:43] light but that was just his thought and
[33:46] then he in order for it to become real
[33:49] he's got to speak it so a thought then
[33:52] becomes a word but then when he speaks
[33:54] it brother Branham makes an interesting
[33:56] point he said what if he said let there
[33:59] be light and no light would have ever
[34:00] came he said that a man could almost be
[34:02] excused for disbelieving God but when
[34:05] God said let there be
[34:07] God actually had to believe his own word
[34:10] he had faith in his own word and then it
[34:13] became when God actually spoke it then
[34:16] creation starts moving and now you've
[34:19] got a light that can be seen you've got
[34:22] an earth that he can plant a garden in
[34:24] he had all of these plans but until it
[34:27] became manifestation all of God's
[34:30] characteristics laid dormant within him
[34:34] and had no effect on anything until it
[34:37] was actually made manifest these
[34:40] prophecies in the book of Revelation
[34:42] have laid dormant for 2,000 years parts
[34:47] of them have been fulfilled in history a
[34:49] study of the book of Revelation shows
[34:51] that the church fulfilled many much of
[34:54] it is already in history much of it's
[34:56] already past we'll get to that when
[34:58] we're teaching it but we are now at the
[35:00] part friends of the unfulfilled parts
[35:03] and God has sent a messenger to reveal
[35:06] to us what to look for what to expect to
[35:10] be able to gauge ourselves against the
[35:12] standard of the word I mean
[35:14] to tell you what you think doesn't
[35:17] matter it's only what His Word says what
[35:20] the world believes or doesn't believe is
[35:22] in material to God his word is still
[35:25] true and the only people who are going
[35:28] to get a manifestation of the body
[35:30] change is people who accept the prophecy
[35:33] of the word that he gives in order to
[35:35] get you to that body change so god bless
[35:39] you apologize for going a few minutes
[35:41] over we will begin our regular service
[35:43] I'm sure it will come on very quickly
[35:45] god bless you
