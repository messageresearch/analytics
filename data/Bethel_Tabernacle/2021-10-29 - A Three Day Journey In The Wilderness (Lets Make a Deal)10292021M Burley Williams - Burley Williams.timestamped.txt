[4:54] happy to be here man
[4:58] man we're gonna get sister deborah to
[4:59] give us a song
[5:01] this morning let's give her our precious
[5:02] sister a hand
[5:03] man
[5:11] [Music]
[5:17] but
[5:18] just a quick little testimony because i
[5:20] don't know if i can make it through the
[5:21] song without crying and i want you guys
[5:24] to know why
[5:25] um when i was probably about the same
[5:29] age as most of you here i really
[5:30] struggled hard with a lot of
[5:32] just depression and anxiety a lot of
[5:35] mental battles that
[5:37] you know satan plagues all of us and he
[5:39] tries to tell you you're the only one
[5:41] struggling with what you're going
[5:43] through but that's a lie
[5:45] it's not true we all have things we're
[5:47] battling
[5:49] and this song means so much to me
[5:51] because it just tells you that if you're
[5:53] in the middle of a battle like that and
[5:55] satan's telling you that you're
[5:57] worthless and that you need to be alone
[5:59] and you need to hide away
[6:01] just praise him just praise him because
[6:03] demons have to flee when you lift your
[6:06] hands in praise
[6:08] and i i'm not a great singer i'm not
[6:11] anything close to what most of you guys
[6:13] who signed up on our solo sheet are but
[6:16] i hope this song is a blessing to you
[6:18] and if you pick up on the chorus you're
[6:20] more than welcome to join in
[6:22] [Music]
[6:47] my is
[6:50] it never does
[6:55] [Music]
[7:12] that i come to
[7:16] [Music]
[7:24] [Music]
[7:27] and when the painful times
[7:31] [Music]
[7:54] i will praise you all day
[7:58] through
[8:03] and when the enemy
[8:06] should rise and the storms around my
[8:10] life
[8:12] [Music]
[8:26] lifted me
[8:30] [Music]
[8:43] as a gift
[8:49] [Music]
[8:56] sometimes my faith just seems so small
[9:01] [Music]
[9:04] but you always catch me when i fall
[9:12] i'm your
[9:14] [Music]
[9:21] and greatest will praise you again
[9:29] i will praise you all day through
[9:37] and when the enemy
[9:40] should rise
[9:42] and the storms surround my life
[9:46] i will praise you then too
[9:53] sometimes the storm is long
[9:57] and it feels like you're gone
[10:01] and i wonder if i'll make it home
[10:09] and i remember
[10:14] [Music]
[10:19] [Applause]
[10:21] [Music]
[10:26] i will praise you
[10:28] [Music]
[10:34] i will praise you all day through
[10:39] [Music]
[10:46] and the storms surround my
[10:51] [Music]
[10:59] will life you
[11:01] [Music]
[11:04] [Applause]
[11:05] [Music]
[11:16] [Applause]
[11:18] [Music]

[12:47] church
[12:49] for having these meetings
[12:51] the burden upon their heart
[12:53] it's a wonderful thing
[12:56] and we want to thank the tabernacle for
[12:58] these things
[13:00] for the burden that they have i share
[13:01] the same burden with them
[13:04] you know it's good to see everyone and
[13:06] we know some
[13:07] have traveled very far
[13:09] but god bless you
[13:10] i'm thankful i just live about an hour
[13:12] and 15 minutes from here
[13:15] so you're counting my hometown
[13:18] so uh anyway praise the lord
[13:22] so let's go to jeremiah chapter one
[13:24] [Music]
[13:26] and we're gonna go to
[13:28] verse nine
[13:30] then the lord puts forth his hand and
[13:32] touched my mouth and the lord said unto
[13:35] me behold i have put my words in thy
[13:38] mouth
[13:39] see i have this day
[13:41] shut thee over the nations
[13:43] over the kingdoms
[13:45] to root out
[13:46] to pull down and to destroy
[13:49] and to throw down to build
[13:52] and to plant
[13:53] father we just want to thank you for the
[13:55] reading of your word and we just pray
[13:56] that you just come and speak to the
[13:58] hearts of your children
[14:00] we give everything to you father we give
[14:02] you all the glory and praise in the name
[14:04] of jesus christ amen you may be seated
[14:21] we uh we just thank god for his grace
[14:23] and mercy
[14:26] you know there's a lot of things may
[14:27] happen rapidly
[14:29] in such a short amount of time
[14:32] many events have taken place
[14:34] you see a lot of things going around the
[14:36] message of the hour
[14:38] like brother jason was ministering last
[14:40] night
[14:41] people falling away
[14:43] those things are
[14:45] also a part of prophecy
[14:47] those things has to happen
[14:49] but i trust and pray this morning i
[14:51] don't know what state you are in life or
[14:53] what you're going through
[14:55] but i do know one thing you have to be
[14:57] determined
[14:59] that yourself that is everybody wants to
[15:01] fall in this message you want
[15:05] you have to have that determination i'm
[15:07] not going to fall i'm going to press on
[15:09] regardless what come you have to be
[15:11] persuaded
[15:13] is that right
[15:15] you know the bible says that we're
[15:17] supposed to be a peculiar people or
[15:19] royal priesthood how many you believe
[15:22] that
[15:23] we want to be a peculiar people but not
[15:25] a familiar people to the world
[15:28] hey man we want to be different they'll
[15:30] see a different characteristic in us
[15:33] and i was just thinking about that word
[15:35] peculiar
[15:36] that word peculiar it can be negative
[15:38] and it can also be positive
[15:40] amen when somebody is kind of living a
[15:42] different type of life
[15:44] that's a
[15:45] you know what i'm talking about peculiar
[15:47] things they're doing things contrary to
[15:48] nature that's a peculiar person
[15:51] amen but we want to be the right type of
[15:54] peculiar people it means that someone
[15:57] has a specific specific
[15:59] characteristic different from common
[16:02] people
[16:03] and that's the way we're supposed to be
[16:05] can we say man we are the bride of jesus
[16:08] christ
[16:09] and you know we got some things that we
[16:10] just want to kind of deal with this
[16:12] morning and uh but the reason why i read
[16:15] jeremiah in the beginning because uh is
[16:19] i read it for a purpose
[16:21] um
[16:22] i want you to notice what he says in
[16:24] verse 10
[16:25] he called jeremiah for a purpose
[16:29] and it says he said i put thee over the
[16:32] nations over the kingdoms
[16:34] and then he put a purpose where i put
[16:36] you there
[16:37] to root out
[16:39] pull down
[16:41] and destroy
[16:42] and to throw down
[16:44] now
[16:44] that don't mean jeremiah was going to go
[16:46] down there and fight people
[16:49] physically
[16:50] amen
[16:52] but he went and done all those things by
[16:54] the word
[16:55] but i want you to notice how god
[16:58] specifically said things
[17:00] it's talking about root out pull down
[17:03] and destroy
[17:04] and throw down
[17:05] but the last two parts is to build
[17:09] and plant
[17:11] see other words he wanted jeremiah to
[17:14] root out whatever needs to be rooted out
[17:16] throw down whatever need to be thrown
[17:18] down get rid of it
[17:20] but not leave it in that shape
[17:22] but build
[17:23] and plant
[17:24] see that's how god does things hey man
[17:27] so you might hear some things and during
[17:29] the services that might sound a little
[17:31] harsh
[17:32] uh rebuking or whatever it is don't get
[17:35] mad at the preacher that's god rooting
[17:37] out some things
[17:39] amen amen because what god want to do is
[17:41] something in your life that don't need
[17:43] to be there and it's hindering god
[17:44] wanted to want it to be pulled out
[17:46] thrown down amen but the main thing at
[17:50] the ending of it god want to build you
[17:53] he want to plant something in you so you
[17:54] can start building you can we say praise
[17:56] the lord
[17:57] so that's why services every service is
[18:00] different amen sometimes god's exhort
[18:03] but sometimes before an exaltation he
[18:05] had to tear some things down didn't give
[18:07] an exhortation amen that's the same as
[18:10] discipline as a parent amen we correct
[18:12] our children but the main thing when you
[18:14] correct somebody don't let them stay in
[18:16] a state that they're lost and they're
[18:18] doomed there's no hope for them amen
[18:20] correct yes but let them know that
[18:23] you're better than that you can be
[18:24] better than that there is hope but
[18:26] sometimes you have to address certain
[18:28] things amen so that people know they
[18:30] need to press on we are the bride of
[18:32] jesus christ can we say man so i wanted
[18:35] to read that scripture first now uh let
[18:38] me tell you something young people
[18:40] uh catch the meaning of the message
[18:44] what is it that's the reality of it
[18:47] we're not just a normal church-going
[18:49] people living any kind of life and say
[18:51] oh i'm saved i'm a religious no we've
[18:54] been called to be live a higher standard
[18:57] than denominational lives
[19:00] can we say praise the lord
[19:01] and i'm so thankful for that because god
[19:04] called us a peculiar people we're
[19:07] supposed to be different but what's
[19:09] happening in this day and time because
[19:11] of the internet and all the social media
[19:13] and stuff like that you can get the
[19:15] whole world right in your phone and
[19:17] don't realize the influences that come
[19:19] from those things
[19:20] thank you brother so we want to just
[19:22] talk about a few things but my main
[19:24] purpose this morning i just want to rip
[19:26] the hide off the devil
[19:29] that's what i'm interested in i like to
[19:31] see people free
[19:32] praise the lord let me tell you
[19:34] something this message it came not to
[19:37] put you in bondage
[19:39] it came to set you free
[19:41] the bible said the commandments of god
[19:44] is not grievous so don't look at the
[19:46] message i can't do this i can't go ahead
[19:49] i can't have that you're looking the
[19:50] wrong way that's the devil he makes you
[19:52] want to get you to look that way but
[19:55] that's not what it's all about it's
[19:57] about seeing you set free being totally
[20:00] delivered
[20:01] god did not preach us a message halfway
[20:03] delivered
[20:05] he preached a message total deliverance
[20:08] and i believe that's what god wants us
[20:10] to be totally delivered can we say man
[20:13] how many of you know what all
[20:15] how many you know what almost saved
[20:16] means
[20:19] almost say mean totally lost
[20:23] huh that's my brother jason like he was
[20:25] talking about this
[20:26] uh last night about being saved god
[20:29] don't want you to be a halfway christian
[20:31] he wants you to be a whole christian all
[20:33] the way god wants your mind your body
[20:35] your soul he wants it all
[20:38] he don't want second place he wants
[20:40] first place
[20:41] can we say praise the lord how many do
[20:43] you believe that you're eagles this
[20:44] morning
[20:45] god identify us as eagles
[20:48] can we say praise the lord but you know
[20:50] let me tell you something about eagles
[20:52] they don't fly in groups
[20:57] when eagles fly
[20:59] they fly alone
[21:00] or you'll see two
[21:03] if you see two is him and his wife
[21:07] they don't fly in groups
[21:08] they don't need groups to survive
[21:11] come on now
[21:12] praise the lord now we're here but
[21:14] eagles eat in groups
[21:17] they'll come down and eat in groups
[21:18] where after they eat they go their
[21:20] separate ways
[21:21] so i want to let you know one thing when
[21:23] you leave this service you got to be
[21:25] still persuaded yourself i can serve god
[21:29] with the group without a group i can
[21:31] serve god
[21:33] that's the way it has to be
[21:35] amen because
[21:37] if you get into a place if you get into
[21:40] a place god do something for you now but
[21:42] you ain't got a revelation of satan in
[21:44] your soul i'ma tell you what's gonna
[21:45] happen to you when you start going
[21:47] through your hard times and things ain't
[21:49] going right you're gonna say huh i guess
[21:52] i better wait for the next camp to get
[21:53] revived again don't let that spirit get
[21:55] on you like that friends
[21:57] because then you'll just be a camp
[21:58] jumper
[22:00] waiting for the next camp to get revived
[22:02] no no no you got to be determined amen
[22:04] i'm going to serve god if i don't go to
[22:06] a camp amen if i got to be by myself i'm
[22:10] going to serve him
[22:12] that's the way it has to be
[22:15] praise the lord so it's not group effort
[22:20] praise the lord
[22:21] all right let's just get into the
[22:22] message right now let's uh i want to
[22:24] turn to luke chapter 4.
[22:38] it's good to hear some of you flipping
[22:39] your bibles
[22:42] that's good
[22:43] because now you know we do it all on the
[22:45] phones
[22:46] hey man but i'm gonna tell you don't you
[22:48] gotta i got my ipad that's fine but i
[22:51] like to hear them bibles flip
[22:53] because sometimes we get so much into
[22:55] the ipads and iphone people think the
[22:57] pillow of fire in the church hey the
[22:58] church glowing up because people don't
[22:59] want to use the bible
[23:03] no get used to them pages
[23:06] luke chapter 4
[23:09] verse 1
[23:10] and jesus being full of the holy ghost
[23:12] returned from jordan
[23:14] and was led by the spirit in the
[23:15] wilderness
[23:17] being 40 days tempted of the devil
[23:19] and in those days he did eat nothing and
[23:22] when they were ended he afterward
[23:25] hungered
[23:26] and the devil said unto him
[23:28] if thou be the son of god command the
[23:31] stone that it be made bread
[23:34] and jesus answered him it is written
[23:37] that man shall not live by bread alone
[23:39] but by every word of god
[23:42] but the devil taking him up in a high
[23:44] mountain
[23:45] showed him all the kingdoms of the world
[23:48] in a moment of time
[23:51] verse 6 and the devil said to him i just
[23:53] want you to listen to this
[23:55] and the devil said unto him
[23:57] all this power will i give thee
[24:01] and the glory of them for it is
[24:03] delivered unto me and to whomsoever will
[24:06] i give it i give it
[24:07] if thou therefore worship me they all
[24:10] shall be
[24:12] dying
[24:14] and jesus answered and said to him get
[24:15] me behind me satan
[24:17] for it is written thou shalt worship the
[24:19] lord thy god and him only shalt thou
[24:23] serve i'm not going to read all the rest
[24:25] of this but uh i want to go to the book
[24:27] of exodus
[24:34] exodus chapter five three i'm sorry
[24:41] i wanted to minister this morning
[24:44] a three-day journey
[24:46] in the wilderness
[24:48] and my subtitle is let's make a deal
[24:52] let's make a deal
[24:56] you notice what we read
[24:59] in the temptation of jesus
[25:01] the prophet of god called it his own
[25:04] personal temptations
[25:07] jesus had personal temptations himself
[25:10] and this is what the devil was dealing
[25:12] with him
[25:13] so you and i each one of us something
[25:16] that might tempt somebody else might not
[25:18] tempt you
[25:20] but the devil knows exactly how to tempt
[25:23] you
[25:24] the devil know exactly what you would be
[25:26] interested in he will not keep you in
[25:28] something you're not interested in
[25:31] it'll be something you're interested in
[25:33] or struggling with that's what the devil
[25:35] will use
[25:37] but what he likes to do how many of you
[25:39] know the devil likes to make deals
[25:42] that's exactly what he was doing to
[25:45] jesus he said i'll give you all of this
[25:48] the power and the glory of them but we
[25:51] have to make the deal
[25:53] and the deal was just worship me
[25:56] serve me
[25:58] i'll give you
[25:59] all of this
[26:00] see the devil like to make deals
[26:02] and i'm here to tell you you got to be
[26:04] able to catch when the devil is trying
[26:06] to make a deal with you
[26:08] deserve it and then you can tell him no
[26:11] deal
[26:13] can we say praise the lord
[26:14] so just follow along with me now in
[26:17] exodus chapter 3
[26:20] verse 13
[26:22] and moses said unto god behold when i
[26:25] come into the children of israel and
[26:27] shall say unto them the god of your
[26:29] fathers has sent me unto you they shall
[26:31] say to me what is his name
[26:34] what shall i say unto them and god said
[26:36] unto moses i am that i am and he said
[26:41] thus i say unto the children of israel i
[26:44] am have sent me
[26:46] unto you
[26:48] and god said more unto moses thus shalt

[26:52] lord god are your fathers the god of
[26:54] abraham the god of isaac the god of
[26:56] jacob have sent me unto you this is my

[27:09] generation and i am me it's present
[27:12] right now present ten i am i am amen

[27:23] gonna be not i ain't gonna wait till
[27:25] tomorrow to get deliverance i'm gonna
[27:27] get delivered right now don't push it
[27:30] off
[27:31] amen now he says
[27:34] in verse 18
[27:37] he said they shall hearken to divorce
[27:40] and thou shalt come
[27:42] and the elders of israel unto the king
[27:44] of egypt
[27:45] you shall say unto him the lord god of
[27:47] the hebrews had met with us and now let
[27:50] us go we beseech thee three days journey
[27:54] in the wilderness that we may sacrifice
[27:56] to the lord our god see that's moses
[28:00] message three days journey in the
[28:03] wilderness so that we could sacrifice to
[28:05] our god and moses never left that
[28:09] message
[28:10] he kept repeating that to pharaoh amen
[28:14] are you with me now let's go to exodus
[28:16] chapter 5.
[28:23] we want to go to verse 1.
[28:26] and afterwards moses and aaron went in
[28:29] told pharaoh
[28:30] just said let the lord god of israel let
[28:33] my people go that they may hold a feast
[28:36] unto me in the wilderness moses just
[28:39] repeating what god said
[28:41] he was determined
[28:43] he was stuck on this message
[28:45] he wasn't going to change it for nobody
[28:48] you and i have to be the same way i am
[28:50] determined this message is true can we
[28:52] say it ma'am and i'm not going to
[28:54] compromise and i'm not going to change
[28:57] for nobody
[28:59] verse 2 pharaoh said who is the lord
[29:02] that i should obey his voice to let
[29:04] israel go i know not the lord
[29:07] neither will i let israel go that's
[29:09] pretty bold
[29:11] that's pretty bold but that's okay
[29:14] now verse three
[29:15] and they said the god of the hebrews had
[29:17] met with us
[29:18] let us go we pray thee
[29:20] three days journey in the desert see
[29:24] going back three days journey in the
[29:26] desert
[29:27] and sacrifice them to the lord our god
[29:30] lest he fall upon us with presence of
[29:32] the sword and the king of egypt said
[29:34] unto them wherefore do you moses and
[29:37] aaron let the people go from their works
[29:39] get you unto your burdens pharaoh said
[29:42] behold the people of the land are now
[29:44] many and you make them rest from your
[29:47] burden see that's the spirit of egypt
[29:49] they just want you to be burdened all
[29:51] the time don't want you to have no
[29:53] freedom but burden sin is a burden
[29:56] unconfessed sin is a burden because
[29:59] it'll plague your mind it'll play
[30:01] thinking and it'll just wait
[30:03] but god when god sets you free it's no
[30:05] burden
[30:07] amen
[30:09] you know you
[30:10] burdens
[30:12] all of you do all of us do you know when
[30:14] you do something wrong your mom and
[30:16] daddy don't know about it but you know
[30:17] you did it wrong that's a burden
[30:20] because the brother kneel you wondering
[30:21] when are they ever going to find out
[30:23] what i did
[30:25] that's the burden and the burden won't
[30:27] leave until you get right with them then
[30:29] the burden leaves that's the same thing
[30:31] with god when john introduced jesus
[30:34] christ he said behold the lamb of god
[30:37] that takes away the sins of the world
[30:40] so if he came to take us take them away
[30:43] from us what makes us think we can live
[30:45] and sin and then be right with him
[30:47] no he came to take them away so we can
[30:50] be
[30:51] delivered
[30:52] all right let's just go on now
[30:55] i want you to now go to exodus chapter
[30:58] 8.
[31:12] when the lord
[31:15] wants to do something in your life
[31:17] now i know
[31:19] we have some here you're probably born
[31:21] you're born again
[31:22] some maybe not
[31:25] i understand those things in different
[31:27] uh categories
[31:30] but i'm trusting that
[31:32] those that are born again when you lead
[31:34] the service you can even be more renewed
[31:38] and those here if you're not born again
[31:40] you'll be born again before you leave
[31:43] that's the purpose the main thing is for
[31:45] you to be helped
[31:48] praise the lord but i want to show you
[31:50] something how the devil works whenever
[31:52] god is moving upon you dealing with your
[31:56] heart do you think the devil is just
[31:58] going to leave you alone he's not he's
[32:01] going to start immediately start making
[32:03] plans how he can deceive you and keep
[32:06] you trapped amen remember even when
[32:09] jesus rebuked satan the bible says the
[32:13] devil left jesus for a season
[32:16] that means he ain't giving up even on
[32:18] jesus other words he said hey you would
[32:21] be pretty good this time i just got to
[32:23] think of another way to get you
[32:26] and that's the same thing he'll do with
[32:27] you we know that you don't caught on to
[32:30] something that he's doing the devil will
[32:32] pull back
[32:33] but then he'll start going another way
[32:35] to try to get you that you're not
[32:36] looking for
[32:38] i'm so thankful for the holy ghost
[32:39] friends because every time the devil
[32:41] makes a move the holy ghost will point
[32:43] him right out and let him know what's
[32:44] going on that's why it's important in
[32:46] this time to be born again the holy
[32:49] ghost will lead you and will guide you
[32:51] into all truth
[32:54] praise the lord so now
[32:56] pharaoh we're here in exodus chapter
[32:59] eight goddamn brought plagues a lot of
[33:01] things that you've been dropping on
[33:03] egypt cause the god was letting the
[33:05] devil know you're gonna let my people go
[33:07] regardless amen but god wanted the
[33:09] egyptians to know that he is the real
[33:12] god so the bible said he judged the gods
[33:15] of egypt god wanted the egyptian to know
[33:18] your god is nothing i am the lord i
[33:21] control everything i am over everything
[33:24] so
[33:25] pharaoh
[33:27] knowing that moses is not going to
[33:29] change his message not going to get off
[33:32] of it pharaoh had to change his tactics
[33:35] and i'm going to show you the very way
[33:37] his tactics has changed it's the same
[33:39] thing that
[33:41] will do to you
[33:43] praise the lord notice verse eight
[33:46] pharaoh called for moses and aaron
[33:49] said and treat
[33:50] the lord that he may take away frogs
[33:52] from me
[33:53] and from my people and i will let the
[33:56] people go that they may sacrifice unto
[33:58] the lord
[34:00] and moses said it to pharaoh glory over
[34:02] me
[34:03] when shall i treat thee in thy service
[34:05] and for thy people
[34:07] to destroy the frogs from thee and thy
[34:09] houses
[34:10] and they may remain
[34:12] in the river only
[34:14] he said tomorrow and he said be it
[34:16] according to thy word now let's just
[34:18] skip down i want to go down to
[34:21] verse 15.
[34:22] but when pharaoh saw that there was
[34:24] respite he heartened his heart and he
[34:27] could not unto them as the lord had
[34:30] said now we know after the we're going
[34:33] to skip a lot for time's sake that's
[34:36] when god don't suck the flies and so
[34:38] forth plague after plague now pharaoh is
[34:41] getting to a point
[34:42] this moses just ain't going to stop
[34:44] until they get out of here until they
[34:46] can go worship their lord he said but i
[34:48] got to be crafty about this because you
[34:50] got to remember pharaoh did not want to
[34:52] let these
[34:53] israelites go
[34:55] it's the same as the devil he don't want
[34:57] you to see be free
[35:00] that's just purpose he don't want you to
[35:02] be free so he'll have to work by the way
[35:05] of deception
[35:07] amen now pharaoh let's jump down to
[35:09] verse 25.
[35:13] pharaoh realized
[35:16] i can't stop this guy
[35:19] he said but i got to make some deals
[35:22] i need to start making deals with moses
[35:26] that's exactly what's going to happen
[35:28] listen to what he says
[35:31] pharaoh called to moses and aaron
[35:33] and said go
[35:35] sacrifice to your god
[35:38] look how he twisted it
[35:40] in the land
[35:42] but that's not what moses said
[35:45] moses said we're going to go a three-day
[35:47] journey
[35:48] in the wilderness
[35:50] so now look at the deception of pharaoh
[35:52] he said okay
[35:54] go on sacrifice that's fine that's what
[35:56] you want to do sacrifice to your lord
[35:59] but
[36:00] in the land now watch out he's trying to
[36:03] make a deal
[36:04] moses said it is not me so to do
[36:08] for shall we sacrifice the abortion of
[36:11] the egyptians to the lord our god you
[36:14] say now brother berlin what that got to
[36:15] do with me it has a lot to do with us
[36:17] the devil does the exact same thing
[36:20] other words he telling moses you go
[36:22] ahead and worship sacrifice to your lord
[36:25] but stay in egypt
[36:28] he'll try to make that same deal with
[36:30] you when god starts dealing with your
[36:32] heart
[36:33] you say i want to serve the lord now
[36:36] amen god don't touch me now now i want
[36:38] to serve the lord but the devil will
[36:40] come that's good you in church but it's
[36:44] okay to still do worldly things it's
[36:47] okay to still have your egyptian habits
[36:50] you're going to church now he's trying
[36:52] to make a deal with you
[36:57] come on now
[36:58] he's pretty crafty
[37:00] hey man if you're just going to come to
[37:02] church have a good sermon and don't want
[37:03] to change you've always gone down to the
[37:05] baptist church friends
[37:06] you might even go ahead and be a
[37:07] presbyterian or something but that's not
[37:10] what this message called for you are the
[37:12] church
[37:13] it's not the building you are the church
[37:15] god want to change you
[37:17] so he said sacrifice in the land
[37:23] praise the lord
[37:25] moses said no no no no no no we're going
[37:27] to worship god
[37:29] egypt ain't going to have nothing to do
[37:30] with it you got to be the exact same way
[37:33] if i'm going to serve god i'm doing away
[37:35] with my egyptian past life it's over
[37:38] with
[37:40] hey amen let's keep going
[37:43] go with me the verse
[37:44] now watch verse 28.
[37:46] now let's just keep reading verse 27
[37:49] he said we will go three days journey in
[37:51] the wilderness
[37:52] sacrifice to the lord our god as he
[37:55] shall commanded us see moses just won't
[37:57] stop he stayed right on his message now
[38:00] pharaoh he's watching moses he said hmm
[38:03] let me change my tactic a little bit
[38:05] more now listen to what he said
[38:08] pharaoh said
[38:10] i will let you go
[38:13] that you may sacrifice to the lord your
[38:14] god
[38:15] in the wilderness
[38:18] listen what he said
[38:19] only you shall not go very far away
[38:28] that's the devil right there
[38:30] see now he said okay
[38:33] not in the land
[38:35] go in the wilderness but don't go very
[38:38] far away same thing the devil dude make
[38:41] a deal okay okay i see now you you you
[38:45] want to serve the lord you don't want
[38:46] your egyptian habits okay okay now the
[38:49] devil will tell you keep going to church
[38:52] but just don't keep going too far
[38:55] don't let your experience get too deep
[38:57] with the lord
[38:59] don't go far away
[39:02] amen why he don't want them to go very
[39:05] far away
[39:06] the reason why the egyptians was lazy
[39:11] the israelites done everything for them
[39:13] when they need them to do something they
[39:15] call them right so moses pharaoh
[39:18] realized if they go too far away when we
[39:20] need something done hey we ain't going
[39:22] to be able to get reached to them so
[39:24] don't go far away that's why the devil
[39:26] say go to church but keep your habits
[39:29] when i want you to lust i want to make
[39:31] sure you're not too far away where i can
[39:33] still use you
[39:35] what i want you to hate i want you to
[39:36] see you ain't went too far i can use
[39:38] hatred i can use certain things in your
[39:41] life if you don't go too far away from
[39:43] me when i want to anoint you and use you
[39:46] but you got to let the devil know nope
[39:48] i'm going far away from you as possible
[39:52] i'm getting far away from this world as
[39:54] possible i don't want to have nothing to
[39:56] do with it
[40:00] let's
[40:00] make a deal
[40:04] verse 29
[40:06] moses said
[40:09] behold i go out from thee
[40:11] and i will intrigue the lord that the
[40:13] swarms of the flies may depart from
[40:15] pharaoh from his service and from his
[40:18] people tomorrow
[40:19] now moses
[40:21] was catching everything
[40:22] listen to what he said
[40:24] let not pharaoh
[40:26] deal deceitfully
[40:28] anymore
[40:30] see pharaoh changed from his boldness i
[40:33] don't know the lord neither are going to
[40:35] let you go but when he seen god kept
[40:38] bringing the plagues and he began to see
[40:40] that moses wasn't going to change he had
[40:42] to start working with deceit
[40:45] and that's what the devil would try to
[40:47] do to you he would try to make he he
[40:49] don't mind you being
[40:50] religious don't mind you going to church
[40:54] satan literally don't mind you singing
[40:56] he don't mind you what he'll my father
[40:57] he'll stand right beside you in worship
[41:00] he do not mind but
[41:03] want to do
[41:04] keep you from being born again full of
[41:06] the holy spirit he just want to keep you
[41:08] from that
[41:10] because he knows once they get that i
[41:12] lost
[41:14] praise the lord so he got to make deals
[41:16] with you
[41:18] all right now just keep going don't deal
[41:21] deceitfully any more let's go to verse
[41:24] 27
[41:25] exodus chapter 9 though
[41:41] exodus 9 27 pharaoh sent
[41:44] call from moses and aaron and saying
[41:45] unto them
[41:47] i have sinned this time
[41:50] praise the lord
[41:52] even he realized i'm a sinner
[41:55] he said the lord is righteous
[41:57] and i my people are wicked
[41:59] and treat the lord for it is enough
[42:01] that there'll be no more mighty
[42:03] thunderings in hell
[42:04] and i will let you go
[42:06] and you shall stay no longer let me tell
[42:09] you something friends
[42:11] i'm gonna show you how the devil work
[42:13] you can come to service after service
[42:16] after service and god be dealing with
[42:18] you and you know that he's dealing with
[42:20] you the devil's that's going to still
[42:23] sit there get more deceitful to stop you
[42:26] from going on further now what i'm
[42:28] speaking to you i'm kind of speaking you
[42:30] know
[42:31] it kind of sounds like i'm saying nobody
[42:32] got the holy ghost no that's not what
[42:34] i'm saying i'm just showing you steps
[42:36] how the devil will try to make deals
[42:39] because even you can be full of the holy
[42:41] spirit he still could try to make deals
[42:42] with you didn't he do that that's what
[42:44] he did to our lord
[42:46] so they was going to keep that balance
[42:47] now
[42:48] for those that are trying to go farther
[42:51] on with the lord and you know you're not
[42:53] born again i just want to show you
[42:54] tricks of the devil to try to stop you
[42:57] from getting there
[43:00] verse 29
[43:01] and moses said unto them
[43:03] as soon as i'm going out of the city i
[43:05] will spread forth my hands
[43:07] and the lord the thunder shall cease
[43:09] neither shall there be any more hell now
[43:12] now i want to skip that i just read that
[43:14] just showing that he between
[43:17] exodus 9 to exodus 10
[43:20] things happened to the cattle boys
[43:22] pestilence rain grievous hell god still
[43:25] dropping these things but that's in
[43:27] between revelation exodus 9 and 10. now
[43:30] i want to go to exodus chapter 10.
[43:40] pharaoh's just making deals
[43:44] that's what he's doing
[43:46] so after these things don't happen with
[43:47] the locusts
[43:49] look at exodus 10 8
[43:51] it says moses and aaron were brought
[43:54] again unto pharaoh
[43:58] and he said unto them
[44:01] go serve the lord your god watch this
[44:03] watch them
[44:05] go
[44:06] go
[44:07] but who are they shall go
[44:10] he asked in a question
[44:12] he already know the answer to
[44:15] because moses already told him
[44:17] now listen to what moses said
[44:20] moses said we will go
[44:23] with our young
[44:25] with our own
[44:26] with our sons with our daughters with
[44:30] our flocks with our herbs we will will
[44:34] we go for we must hold a feast unto the
[44:38] lord now watch
[44:40] around
[44:41] all of this happening
[44:43] he let him know moses let him know who i
[44:46] was going to go now watch how religious
[44:48] this devil gets now listen what he said
[44:51] verse 10 he said until
[44:53] let the lord
[44:55] be so with you
[44:59] but in the beginning he said i don't
[45:00] know this lord who
[45:02] i don't know but now he's saying god
[45:04] bless you let the lord be with you
[45:08] let him be with you
[45:10] you see every time somebody talk to you
[45:11] about the lord that don't mean they are
[45:13] right with the lord
[45:14] that could be deceit
[45:17] oh come on now praise the lord
[45:20] i'ma tell you we always preaching we
[45:22] will we say
[45:24] get married
[45:25] in the message
[45:28] that's kind of not true it kind of need
[45:31] to be a little more balanced on that
[45:34] don't marry them because they're in the
[45:35] message you marry them make sure the
[45:37] message is in them
[45:38] not just because they're in a message
[45:40] church you make sure that message is in
[45:44] is that right cause the devil can get
[45:46] you on that too well i like this boy i
[45:49] know he ain't got the holy ghost and i
[45:51] ain't either but we're in a message
[45:53] church no no don't work like that
[45:58] praise the lord
[46:01] then you got the other side
[46:03] well i'm in the message and and i have
[46:06] the holy spirit and i feel wrong
[46:08] relationship with the lord but the boys
[46:10] in the message they're so immature
[46:15] but this song over there in the
[46:17] pentecostal church and he's a real
[46:18] mature young man and i think the lord is
[46:21] leading me that way i don't think he is
[46:27] oh this this sister's oh she just

[1:00:22] marriage should be to jesus christ

[1:00:53] you're not even ready
[1:00:58] starts in you first
[1:01:07] another thing about the eagle i love
[1:01:12] when a female
[1:01:14] knows that a male is liking her
[1:01:21] he just flying around
[1:01:24] let's start sticking out she's just
[1:01:26] looking at me
[1:01:30] he won't impress
[1:01:32] him away she's looking at the wings oh
[1:01:34] look at them
[1:01:37] boy
[1:01:39] but you know what she does it's a ritual
[1:01:44] before a female eagle
[1:01:46] be with the male
[1:01:48] she'll go pick up a stick
[1:01:50] or she'll pick up a stone she'll fly
[1:01:52] high as she can go
[1:01:56] and she'll just drop it
[1:02:00] he'll have to catch that stick
[1:02:02] of that stone before it hit the ground
[1:02:08] she would not be with him
[1:02:10] the purpose of it is
[1:02:12] when she trains her babies how to fly
[1:02:14] she put them on her back
[1:02:17] she flips upside down and shake them off
[1:02:20] she knows he can't pick up that stick
[1:02:22] he can't pick up that stone

[1:02:33] around you
[1:02:35] quote books
[1:02:38] look at he dressed just right you know
[1:02:40] what you need to do

[1:05:04] oh man but man i ain't got enough time
[1:05:06] bro
[1:05:07] but we'll keep
[1:05:11] back to the scripture
[1:05:16] i want you to notice
[1:05:20] verse 10 he said let the lord be so with
[1:05:23] you and i'll let you go and your little
[1:05:24] ones and look to it for evil is before
[1:05:26] you
[1:05:27] let's go down to verse 12.
[1:05:29] and the lord said unto moses stretch out
[1:05:31] thy hand over the land of egypt for
[1:05:33] locusts that they may come upon the land
[1:05:36] of egypt and eat every earth of the land
[1:05:39] even all that have the hell hath left
[1:05:42] now i want to jump down to verse 24.
[1:05:45] i hope you catch this
[1:05:48] satan keep trying to make deals
[1:05:52] i mean through pharaoh
[1:05:54] now watch when you see that moses ain't
[1:05:56] going to lead the little children
[1:05:59] he ain't going to stay in the land
[1:06:00] he's going to go far away when he sees
[1:06:02] that he can't keep him he's still got to
[1:06:04] keep changing strategies
[1:06:06] and the devil will do the same thing
[1:06:07] with you he'll do the same thing with me
[1:06:10] he'll change strategies
[1:06:12] so look at what he said verse 24 pharaoh
[1:06:15] called to moses and said
[1:06:16] go share the lord
[1:06:20] he just won't give up
[1:06:22] he said only let your flocks
[1:06:24] and your herbs be staid
[1:06:27] let your little ones also go with you
[1:06:29] see god just put a good whipping on him
[1:06:31] with them locust
[1:06:33] first just take them too just take them
[1:06:35] but leave your flocks
[1:06:37] see
[1:06:38] that's the same thing now let's just
[1:06:40] keep reading verse 25 moses said thou
[1:06:42] must give us also sacrifices and burnt
[1:06:44] offerings that we may sacrifice unto the

[1:07:16] why christ died for you god don't want
[1:07:18] you to be sitting in the message with a
[1:07:20] bunch of knowledge but not recognizing
[1:07:22] what he does for you on calvary he
[1:07:24] wanted them to leave without a sacrifice
[1:07:28] you have to stay in this word yourself i
[1:07:31] can't make you steady your pastor can't
[1:07:32] make you study but you gotta have a want
[1:07:34] to
[1:07:36] to lay it
[1:07:37] out
[1:07:40] moses said we ain't going to leave a
[1:07:41] hoof
[1:07:43] think about that
[1:07:45] not
[1:07:47] people left out of egypt
[1:07:51] for it to be too over to
[1:07:54] the battle had to be
[1:07:56] yeah
[1:07:57] and moses telling us man
[1:07:59] we ain't gonna leave a hoof
[1:08:02] now ferguson
[1:08:04] falls
[1:08:06] really
[1:08:07] man i'm letting you go
[1:08:08] and you're going to tell me with all
[1:08:10] that you got you ain't going to leave a
[1:08:12] hoof mother said nope because everything
[1:08:14] that belongs to god going
[1:08:16] you got to be the exact same way satan i
[1:08:19] ain't leaving you nothing
[1:08:21] everything about me i'm gonna give it to
[1:08:24] god i ain't leaving you nothing i'm
[1:08:26] going all of the way you got to have
[1:08:28] that same determination
[1:08:29] [Applause]
[1:08:33] that's right
[1:08:35] let's
[1:08:36] make a deal
[1:08:38] you see
[1:08:40] that three-day journey
[1:08:42] in the wilderness
[1:08:43] when god deals with your heart
[1:08:45] he's dealing with you
[1:08:47] you still can be living in sin
[1:08:50] filter all and stuff still in your life
[1:08:53] but because you responded
[1:08:55] to him calling you
[1:08:57] that puts you in a justified state
[1:09:03] you're coming to church
[1:09:05] yeah you got them habits
[1:09:07] but you don't want them
[1:09:11] don't stop there
[1:09:13] the devil says see you're in church no
[1:09:15] no he said no no to satan
[1:09:17] the things i got in my life i don't want
[1:09:18] him there so then you got to go to the
[1:09:20] next step the sanctification
[1:09:24] so now as you keep coming to church keep
[1:09:26] coming to church hearing the word
[1:09:31] what's going to happen as you're
[1:09:32] listening to the word cleansing start
[1:09:34] taking place in your life
[1:09:37] then you begin to realize
[1:09:39] i don't want to do that no more i don't
[1:09:42] i can't even think like that no more my
[1:09:44] thinking is different my ways is
[1:09:45] different i want to dress diff i want to
[1:09:47] act different god's just cleansing you
[1:09:49] up that's just two stages
[1:09:52] can we say amen but if you keep pressing
[1:09:55] on somewhere i don't win everybody is
[1:09:57] different
[1:09:59] somewhere down the line if you just keep
[1:10:01] pressing on god will fill you with
[1:10:03] himself
[1:10:05] there goes your three days journey
[1:10:08] in that wilderness but it's not gonna be
[1:10:10] a witness it's a journey though
[1:10:11] are you with me but you got to be like
[1:10:13] moses the was keep trying him to stop
[1:10:16] from taking the three-day journey but
[1:10:18] moses was determined we're going all the
[1:10:20] way you'll have to be the exact same way
[1:10:25] give me say praise the lord
[1:10:28] i just got a few more minutes
[1:10:34] but abandon says
[1:10:36] actually
[1:10:38] when goliath
[1:10:39] came down to the children of israel
[1:10:42] he said that's what goliath said let's
[1:10:44] make a deal
[1:10:47] let me remember the story
[1:10:49] you remember
[1:10:51] saul in the israelite was on top of a
[1:10:54] mountain
[1:10:55] the philistine was on top of a mountain
[1:10:57] you remember brother jason was talking
[1:10:59] about the greatest battle fought in the
[1:11:00] mind
[1:11:01] he that's that's the scripture the
[1:11:03] prophet used in that message but down in
[1:11:05] the valley where they meet that's where
[1:11:06] the battle was going to take place
[1:11:08] so your mind is that valley
[1:11:11] but you notice now
[1:11:13] uh mo saw them on the mountain
[1:11:15] philistines on the mountain but you know
[1:11:17] we always talk about mountaintop
[1:11:19] experiences we all happy and so forth
[1:11:22] sawn it was on the mountain but they
[1:11:23] wasn't having a mountaintop experience
[1:11:27] they were defeated
[1:11:30] goliath
[1:11:32] defeated the israelites
[1:11:35] without throwing a
[1:11:38] weapon didn't shoot no boat they didn't
[1:11:41] throw no spear
[1:11:43] but saw them was on top of a mountain
[1:11:45] defeated
[1:11:47] how did he defeat them with words
[1:11:52] they didn't swing nothing at them words
[1:11:55] that's why the greatest battle is fought
[1:11:57] in the mind when the devil starts trying
[1:11:59] to want to plug your mind you got to
[1:12:01] know how to rebuke that devil just like
[1:12:02] jesus did it is written push those
[1:12:05] thoughts away get rid of them
[1:12:07] don't let him nest and just keep
[1:12:09] meditating upon him then you're going to
[1:12:11] manifest it that's right
[1:12:14] but all of that talking he did
[1:12:17] let's make a deal what's the deal
[1:12:20] if we beat you you serve us
[1:12:23] but if you beat us
[1:12:25] we'll serve you it's all about serving
[1:12:28] you
[1:12:29] that's what the devil is all about want
[1:12:31] god people to serve him
[1:12:33] that's what it's all about
[1:12:35] and saw them was defeated
[1:12:38] until one came
[1:12:41] here comes david
[1:12:43] amen you know what david was
[1:12:46] david was a deal breaker
[1:12:50] amen david let them know no deal
[1:12:54] you got to be the exact same way when
[1:12:56] the devil want to bring something to you
[1:12:58] whether it's a boy whether it's a girl
[1:12:59] whether it's your fashion what if it's
[1:13:01] moving what is it music you gotta
[1:13:04] [Applause]
[1:13:07] you got to be the deal breaker
[1:13:09] when the devil want to make a deal with
[1:13:11] you you'll be the deal breaker
[1:13:13] and i was telling you to take the word
[1:13:15] of god and you can do it
[1:13:17] amen
[1:13:18] praise the lord
[1:13:22] this is where it has to be
[1:13:24] no deal
[1:13:26] i'm trying to
[1:13:27] rush a lot of stuff here but
[1:13:29] i think you got the point
[1:13:33] this
[1:13:34] this put me teaching in the morning i'm
[1:13:36] trying my best
[1:13:37] i'm not a teacher but
[1:13:39] i'm trying that you know that
[1:13:41] so you got evangelists sitting over
[1:13:43] there that evangel anointing kind of hit
[1:13:45] me make me wanna
[1:13:47] i'm trying to slow it down a little bit
[1:13:49] it's kind of hard
[1:13:51] praise the lord
[1:13:53] but i want to tell you young people let
[1:13:54] me back up here let me throw a few more
[1:13:56] things in here
[1:13:57] and then we'll let you go
[1:14:03] there's all kinds of deals
[1:14:05] that the devil can give
[1:14:07] it's a shame
[1:14:11] sometimes the devil wants you to do that
[1:14:16] i'm
[1:14:17] you
[1:14:18] of things that you doing or done done
[1:14:21] or dealing with
[1:14:23] but i'm here to tell you this
[1:14:26] never break a relationship with your
[1:14:28] parents
[1:14:29] that you can't talk to him
[1:14:33] never break a relationship pastor
[1:14:36] you can't talk to him
[1:14:38] because when you're not strong yourself
[1:14:40] to be able to deal with things
[1:14:42] the devil's going to make deals with you
[1:14:44] just tell you you okay you're dealing
[1:14:46] with it
[1:14:47] but sometimes you need somebody to talk
[1:14:49] to
[1:14:51] and there's nobody better than your
[1:14:52] parents your pastor
[1:14:55] because we're here to help a lot of
[1:14:57] times yeah
[1:14:59] i like to put it to you like this
[1:15:01] when you are ashamed
[1:15:04] of the way that you've been living
[1:15:06] that's good
[1:15:11] it's actually good
[1:15:12] when you're ashamed
[1:15:14] that lets you know there's still
[1:15:15] conviction there
[1:15:18] but when you're not ashamed
[1:15:21] whatever whatever that's bad
[1:15:24] friends the most gracious thing god
[1:15:25] could ever do to a human being and he
[1:15:28] done the prophet god said
[1:15:30] he's only obligated to deal with you one
[1:15:33] time
[1:15:34] and he don't have to do it again
[1:15:38] he said that
[1:15:39] he dealt with cain
[1:15:41] one time
[1:15:42] came refused he never dealt with him
[1:15:44] again
[1:15:45] but god is so gracious
[1:15:48] he keep calling he keep knocking he keep
[1:15:51] knocking but you know what you'll have
[1:15:54] to respond
[1:15:56] go
[1:15:57] nothing
[1:15:58] you will have to respond i don't have to
[1:16:00] shout
[1:16:01] to preach to you and say i'm anointed i
[1:16:04] don't you don't have to do that it's
[1:16:05] different types of service it can be
[1:16:07] simple talking just like this too god
[1:16:10] can deal with your heart
[1:16:15] let me tell you something friend i
[1:16:17] believe god here at this count
[1:16:19] and all you came on your own accord
[1:16:23] i just sit back
[1:16:25] listening to the singing
[1:16:28] that's that's awesome
[1:16:29] yeah
[1:16:30] i just really feel the presence of the
[1:16:32] lord that's good so you got a wonderful
[1:16:35] setup
[1:16:36] and then the word comes forth
[1:16:39] it's all is for the purpose for god to
[1:16:41] break change
[1:16:45] when paul and silas
[1:16:47] was in prison
[1:16:50] you know a earthquake
[1:16:53] most time we talk about earthquake we
[1:16:55] speak of destruction
[1:16:56] buildings falling this happening distant
[1:16:58] taking place
[1:17:00] but you remember the story when paul
[1:17:05] and saying god the bible said the
[1:17:07] foundation of the prison it was a great
[1:17:10] earthquake
[1:17:11] and the foundation of the prison was
[1:17:13] shaken
[1:17:14] but
[1:17:17] what you and i would think about
[1:17:21] because usually when an earthquake comes
[1:17:22] it comes to destroy things
[1:17:24] but this was a specially
[1:17:27] designed
[1:17:28] earthquake sent straight from god
[1:17:33] because when the prison though when it
[1:17:34] when the prison foundation shook
[1:17:37] that earthquake was designed to open
[1:17:39] doors
[1:17:55] and then they wake up what happened what
[1:17:57] happened then all the prisoners looked
[1:18:00] whoa
[1:18:00] doors and all of that happened
[1:18:03] because the tuba
[1:18:05] prison wasn't in them
[1:18:10] when they started off singing
[1:18:13] other prisoners were probably over there
[1:18:15] really
[1:18:17] really
[1:18:18] here we are locked up in them idiots up
[1:18:20] there singing songs
[1:18:22] really we don't want to hear all of that
[1:18:24] but they just kept on singing kept on
[1:18:27] singing amen like sometimes people being
[1:18:30] worship serving oh they singing another
[1:18:31] special oh come on get it over with man
[1:18:34] come on uh-huh
[1:18:38] but as they begin to sing that's why i
[1:18:40] like it when you can get one person
[1:18:42] and start praising
[1:18:44] and they just stay there stay there and
[1:18:46] start affecting other people
[1:18:48] you can't let nobody stop your praise
[1:18:50] can we say man
[1:18:52] come on now when god tell you to praise
[1:18:54] start praising
[1:18:56] it's gonna help somebody else
[1:19:00] because in their praise
[1:19:02] in their worship it caused doors to be
[1:19:05] open for somebody else but here's the
[1:19:08] thing
[1:19:09] when the door was open
[1:19:12] it was their choice
[1:19:14] to walk out
[1:19:17] god opened the doors but he didn't make
[1:19:19] him walk out
[1:19:21] was standing right there
[1:19:23] all they have to do now
[1:19:25] is just walk out
[1:19:29] so i'm gonna tell you that's why it's
[1:19:30] important
[1:19:31] for a believer you
[1:19:33] and me to know where our position is
[1:19:37] in the body of christ because god want
[1:19:40] to use you
[1:19:41] to help somebody else
[1:19:43] that's why you got to find your place
[1:19:45] notice often god said in the message of
[1:19:47] adoption you don't just pop in them
[1:19:49] places you don't pop in a position
[1:19:52] you're predestinated for it
[1:19:54] god got every one of you here for a
[1:19:56] reason
[1:19:59] talk about the things they went to youth
[1:20:01] camp they've done wrong they've done all
[1:20:02] kind of things but you know what they
[1:20:04] came out right but i'm not here to tell
[1:20:06] you keep doing wrong to come out right
[1:20:08] no get right and stay right
[1:20:11] that might not be the past that's for
[1:20:12] you
[1:20:14] because i'm not here to preach to you
[1:20:15] young people a permissive willed message
[1:20:19] i'm preaching to you a perfect will
[1:20:21] message
[1:20:22] when you don't grow it up in the message
[1:20:24] heard all of the truth
[1:20:26] you know some people come into message
[1:20:28] lives messed up you might see the pastor
[1:20:30] deal with them a different way that got
[1:20:32] nothing to do with you
[1:20:33] they came in messed up
[1:20:35] hello situation courage all kind of
[1:20:38] baggage they be dealt with the same way
[1:20:40] you cannot take that right one pastor
[1:20:42] why can't you deal with me like that no
[1:20:43] no no it's different for you cause
[1:20:45] you're called to a more higher college
[1:20:46] because you know what truth is
[1:20:50] are you with me
[1:20:54] i better quit
[1:20:56] i just
[1:20:58] i got
[1:21:02] i quit bro
[1:21:03] i got a whole bunch right here but
[1:21:06] i know some of you probably
[1:21:08] your stomach growling you're hungry but
[1:21:10] but god bless you but i just want to say
[1:21:12] this i love you
[1:21:14] i love you with all of my heart
[1:21:16] but young people don't leave this camp
[1:21:19] don't even leave the day without
[1:21:20] something that took place in your life
[1:21:24] i can give you incidents after incidents
[1:21:26] of things
[1:21:27] that's happening but it don't matter
[1:21:30] what's happening right now
[1:21:32] is god trying to deal with you
[1:21:34] pull you closer to him this is the now
[1:21:37] right now so friends
[1:21:40] even on the campground please do me a
[1:21:42] favor
[1:21:43] don't form a denomination on the
[1:21:45] campground
[1:21:49] he said what do you mean by that oh yeah
[1:21:50] you can form your little denomination
[1:21:52] some of you start clicking up and just
[1:21:54] because somebody there might be a little
[1:21:55] different for you you don't want them in
[1:21:57] your little clique
[1:21:59] don't do that let's be brothers and
[1:22:01] sisters
[1:22:03] on this campground
[1:22:04] [Applause]
[1:22:14] be around somebody
[1:22:16] that's positive
[1:22:19] not negative
[1:22:20] a statement was made to me
[1:22:23] an individual told me said i want my
[1:22:24] children
[1:22:26] to hang around other struggling children
[1:22:28] so they can relate i said no no no no
[1:22:33] struggle
[1:22:34] plus struggle equals what
[1:22:37] struggle
[1:22:39] to know you want your child to hang
[1:22:41] around a child that don't overcame
[1:22:45] that's what you need to do hang around
[1:22:47] somebody that don't overcame
[1:22:49] because they probably don't been through
[1:22:50] something you don't went through there
[1:22:55] you got something struggling and you
[1:22:57] struggling and y'all just talking to
[1:22:58] each other all they're gonna be
[1:23:00] yeah i'm going through this too yeah me
[1:23:02] too man it's pretty hard yeah it really
[1:23:04] really is rough
[1:23:06] all right see you in service tomorrow
[1:23:07] both of you still walk away strugglers
[1:23:11] but if you could somebody they want to
[1:23:13] talk about the word
[1:23:16] encourage you
[1:23:17] until you can get to a place in your own
[1:23:19] life
[1:23:20] somebody with the word
[1:23:22] do that on this camp cause i'm saying
[1:23:24] this i mean i can't tell you how many
[1:23:26] camps i don't preach and camp out the
[1:23:28] camp i see clicks and groups and groups
[1:23:30] and groups they're easy to identify
[1:23:32] first day on the camp you don't know
[1:23:34] what's what what but as the days go by
[1:23:36] you better be identify the groups in
[1:23:38] other words you got to call it the hair
[1:23:39] group
[1:23:42] always start putting their hair a
[1:23:43] certain way then you can point them all
[1:23:45] out because they're going to because a
[1:23:47] little girl that they look up to
[1:23:49] got a little early spirit on her
[1:23:51] seem to be popular say i want to hang
[1:23:54] around the popular way and then you
[1:23:55] start fixing your hair to fit in with
[1:23:57] the hair group
[1:24:01] oh yeah that's the influence
[1:24:04] then the cool guy group
[1:24:07] the guy walking around the camp
[1:24:09] every eye on him
[1:24:12] usually got a bunch of grease in the
[1:24:14] head you can fry a chicken with it
[1:24:17] huh
[1:24:18] and the girls just said
[1:24:21] oh
[1:24:21] then the other little boy he's cool
[1:24:25] if he don't get right where he going
[1:24:26] ain't cool
[1:24:29] but you want to get in that little group
[1:24:31] the cool boy group
[1:24:32] and hang around walking
[1:24:34] what's that
[1:24:37] and then all the girls
[1:24:39] the popular hair girl hair group look at
[1:24:41] the cool boy group
[1:24:44] he's looking at you
