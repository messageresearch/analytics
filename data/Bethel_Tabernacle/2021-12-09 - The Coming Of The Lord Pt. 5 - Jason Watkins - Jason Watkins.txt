you know i'm i'm the pastor i can have you murdered [Laughter] sacrifice michael i can have your sacrifice there you go amen praise the lord but actually i told brother brother jd that i was just going to use the handheld tonight because it's wednesday and i won't preach as long if i've got a handheld amen and that's good for wednesday night we're going to invite you to saint john chapter 6 and as you're turning there we just want to i heard the announcement about the youth gathering uh this friday at six and i'm sure that's going to be a wonderful time amen and uh should come really expecting and then uh then on the um the saturday so that'll be the 11th and then we have the harvest gathering at brother mike and sister wanda's place and they sent me a picture today they're setting it up nice and so it's a little scaled down as we've said but it's still going to be wonderful we're going to have a number of things set up with activities and so amen praise the lord you got a lot to attend and a lot of good fellowship and you know i always like to remind people that that the fellowship isn't just what you receive it's what you give because other people need your fellowship you need their fellowship so you know uh we we don't want to be islands to ourselves we want to come and fellowship with the saints of god amen so we want to uh just make those two announcements before we go i've got a number of requests that we're going to get when we go to prayer at the end i want to continue to pray for brother jason's in-laws and brother don says to mary hoffman and so we'll give you an update on the at the end there and then jeremiah has some quite a bit of extensive dental work he's got a face right away so we want to be praying for those if you have a request if you're online you have a request get it to me directly by whatsapp that's the first place i'll look and a lot of times i'll get back to my office and realize somebody tried to sneak one in under the finish line and i missed it so we don't want to miss it i'd like to get it so if you have a request just send it to me personally and i'll get that amen praise the lord in saint john 6 we want to continue tonight and i i i didn't really think this morning a little ways after 8 a.m that this sermon would connect to my series on the coming of the lord but uh you know it just it broke open to me so beautifully and as i studied it throughout the day particularly in the afternoon i realized my goodness it exactly fits and so the lord uh knew amen i was telling sister debbie i wasn't scheduled to preach tonight but i sure wanted to and uh so the lord made a way for that so we're happy amen i want to take a subtitle tonight as i announce to you um on the church-wide chat from bitterness to sweetness amen amen let's look in saint john chapter six uh happy to welcome brother brad sister sarah jackson here with us amen um verily very verse 47 we're going to read 47-58 we'll let you be seated verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life i am that bread of life that's a pretty bold statement isn't it your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven so what do you do with bread it's not a a a wall ornament it's not a shelf decoration bread is for consuming amen that's right off the bat bread is for consuming you need to eat it that's that's the reason you have it all right and i am the living bread verse 51 again that the living bread which came down from heaven verse 51 if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world in that beautiful the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him catch that now read 56 again he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father what kind of father as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever amen let's pray father we thank you for your word now and i commit the reading of it and the hearing of it into your hands lord let me have the path of anointing that i can deliver this thought lord i am sure that it it came upon me early this morning as if it just fell out of the heavens lord and i just just uh from my morning bible study listening lord and sitting and other ministers and commentary and different things that were going and suddenly something struck me and i raced to the bible and quickly i read it and i said my goodness how have i looked at that in reverse my whole life lord and so i i'm just thanking you for it today and i pray that you will let it be a benefit to every hearer now we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated brother caleb if you will give me please from the book of revelation and the 14th chapter i want to catch one verse which will be the eighth verse revelation 14 and 8. now i want you to notice the scripture and it will become important as i go along and there followed another angel saying babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication it's an amazing amazing statement that you're going to understand as we get going in it i'm going to read it for you again and there followed another angel saying babylon has fallen is fallen that great city because she hath made all nations drink of the wine of her fornication now we've been breaking down revelation the 10th chapter quite a bit in this little series on the coming of the lord and i have said and say again how much i have personally enjoyed it and and gleaned from it myself it's been quite a delicious meal for me full seven course meal kind of like in case y'all can't tell i like food amen praise the lord and and i love the spiritual food that we have gleaned out of that 10th chapter and we've been breaking down the importance of what god did in that chapter as it relates to you and i today because had it had it not been for the restoration of that word there would have we would have we would have remained a church that could not go in the rapture and that's where brother branham said that was the conundrum that was the problem that that the church could not go in the rapture in the condition that it was in and since the last age had dismissed jesus from their assembly and gave him the boot and kicked him out and he stood outside first the only gener the only age to do that then because that they kicked him out of the church then they couldn't get any better they couldn't improve so when you already are in a state where you can't go in a rapture that's bad enough but as if that's not bad enough they can't get any better so you're hopeless you're not you're not just helpless at that point you are without any hope and so when god came that mighty angel descended this ought to bring us to our feet rejoicing this ought to thrill us to say my i couldn't make it no one could make it but now i can make it because one came down and and we've showed you the necessity of that verse seven that seventh angel messenger and we showed you but then now of course we've also shown you uh with great care that that there is far more written about the bride eating the book and prophesying than than there is written about the seventh messenger the seventh messenger occupies a single verse amen but you you occupy verse eight verse nine verse ten verse eleven you understand and so so now we have the ministry of the son of man again in a many-membered bride we literally we have that ministry now the there's a difference as we've taught you many times there's a vast difference between the office of son of man and the ministry of son of man the office of son of man is a prophet the ministry of the son of man is the word made flesh amen and therefore now that we have taken the book and eaten the book then we now are in possession of and we are operating i don't care how you feel about you how discouraged you might be with you according to god's scripture we are now fulfilling the ministry of the son of man say well but don't we need a prophet we we we we had a prophet who who completed his assignment and the bible tells us that the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy so because now you have the full word you are you are singularly have the full testimony of jesus christ therefore the spirit of prophecy is on you amen now this is exactly why we have went down and we have shown you that it can't just be a metaphor it can't just be a cliche it can't just be doctrine it has to translate into a life it has to become material there was no writing on the white stone when brother branham pulled the lid off of that pyramid rock there was white stone on which there was no writing and of course there wouldn't be any writing because this mystery was going to be written not on paper but behind skin it was going to be you the living word made flesh amen because the because we realize that that though that the word as a prophet taught us the word interpreted is a revelation of the name of god and it was in the white stone that he said i'll write a new name and and i'm here to tell you something friends you're it mrs jesus christ amen so it must become a lived life and the problem that too many people face is they go years sitting in a message church without the message in them amen and doesn't do you won't do you any more good to sit in a church that won't make you a christian as oh as old mays jackson used to say won't make you a christian any more than sitting in a garage i'll make you an automobile you've got to be born again you've got to have an experience and you lucky you fortunate you elected you chosen you you have arrived at the age when it's no longer just a dip of the holy spirit but it's the holy ghost himself the full token restored the full abstract the jubilee has been returned to us the book has been unsealed so it must become a living life and and i'm gonna take a photo of it tonight that i haven't i haven't hit you this is why it shocked me when i realized this is actually part of my series because i realized i've talked about our lifestyles and being the living word and how it ought to affect us and and how it ought to be a guide to our life but there's another element that i want to get to tonight that we haven't talked about yet that is also a very necessary element in identifying god's family in the earth amen see that is a family who will overcome every trial every affliction every persecution every separation every kind of conflict the true bride of jesus christ is just as much predestinated to go into trials and tribulations as she was to receive the engrafted word and get a body change amen amen so we've been breaking down then verse 1 of chapter 11 showing you know where he says there was given me a reed like and unto a rod and i'm going to watch my time very closely and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein so what's being measured now is the place of true worship and there's only one place in true worship for with true worship that and it's the same place with true fellowship it's the same place where the living blood is amen and so there's only by blood do we have redemption there's only fellowship through redemption amen and there's only true worship in redemption and the bible teaches us that many will rise and jesus spoke of it that many will worship him and and but yet it won't count and they won't get any credit for it because it's not a complete worship it's a it's a partial worship having rejected the fullness of who he is i mean how do you cl how would you worship up something that you don't even receive as true amen amen of course your worship would be artificial if you're rejecting him as as any part of him as that you don't believe that and you don't think it's true and it's not valid then what do you think of him then how do you claim you're worshiping him but denying the reality of who he is and the things he taught in his word that i mean a child would understand that doesn't compute see and so the only way that true worship is received is in spirit and in truth it wouldn't matter where the church was it wouldn't matter what nation you lived in there that it used to matter it used to be at a temple in a certain city and they couldn't go anywhere else and and that was the sin you know of of dan and and of the sin of jeroboam when he put altars in and dan and and ephraim and the people worship said oh jerusalem's too far the journey but i'm here to tell you something friends the journey to heaven is never designed to be an easy journey it ought to cost us something it ought to require an investment of our life in it it if you gained it with the precious blood of the most precious person to ever live this gospel is not a cheap gospel that's why we preach it that's why we won't compromise because it's not a cheap gospel it costs the blood of millions of martyrs it costs the blood of christ it costs the blood all the way down of saints of god and i'm here to tell you today i defend it i stand for it i strongly and admonish you and and i remind you of the scripture when you don't want to obey the word i remind you the scripture says obey them that have the word over you that have rulership of the word over you they they're not here to hurt you they're here for your soul amen so i know sometimes you want the preacher to leave you alone he can't amen that's right because the fire of god burns in him and god won't leave him alone so we have to pass the fire amen amen all right now so we found then that the bride of the last day this is the last thing we see of her we've shown you how that revelation 11 1 validates the 10th chapter it validates the mighty angel it validates the earthly strong angel it validates the bride's action it validates the message was true this first verse validates it because literally we see that the bride has become the measurable perfection reflecting the image of christ and so we're coming then to a place uh where we have we have now when you read this you realize that the bride is now ready for her body change she's become the living tabernacle of the living god's presence in the earth in the earth i'm not going getting to heaven before i demonstrate the visible perfection of the word of god i'm here to make a voice in the earth amen and so having reached this this position then of course the the pyramid is capped the bright tree has come back to full bloom with fruit growing in the top of the tree seed has come back to seed completing the harvest cycle the saints of the uh of the church ages for 2 000 years are raised from the dead and we receive glorified bodies with them like un unto his glorified body revelation 11 1 now here's something that i want you to catch and i'm going to start to really angle into my thought tonight revelation 11 1 is preceded by the necessity of eating the book in revelation 10 8. yes amen you're never going to fulfill revelation 11 1 if you're refusing to eat the book of revelation 10 8. and then when we eat the book in so doing we become the book because the book is the lamb's book it's the lamb's book of life the book is christ the revealed word and we found out that the book is no longer in the hands of the angel it's inside the bride amen she is him as the living word she's the final voice this is exactly the great mystery plan that god devised for us to be as saint paul said filled with all the fullness of god amen he said that to the church he said that to a church in ephesus who had been believers for 30 years and he's saying now i but i i want to see you become all the fullness i want to see you filled so this this actually became an unrealized desire of his heart paul himself falling asleep and wading through seven church ages for this time when your perfection will deliver him back to the earth again and a body of flesh that's what they desire they here we are in this broken down body desiring that theophany but brother branham shows us those in that theophany are desiring to come back here as much as you're desiring to get there they're desiring to come back here hallelujah friends it's going to move the heart of god one of these mornings oh my so ephesians 3 19 and to know the love of christ this is preaching to born-again people to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god he goes on in the fourth chapter till we all come into the unity of the faith and under the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure see there's another measurement under the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ so we already eat the book yes amen that's why we're here we are to eat the book you know when you eat when do you normally stop when you're full amen i want to tell you something friends when you have me over for dinner you might set out some appetizers to tie me over till the full meal comes but they're not to tie me over till next time i come to your house to eat see so can i say to you tonight don't don't sit here at the table of the lord and nibble at the food and eat just enough to get you by the next sunday come on paul was desiring that you come into the whole fullness that you gain a knowledge that that's something that surpasses normal knowledge that the love of christ becomes so in you i mean that's what the capstone was that that perfect love that perfect fellowship that perfect god coming down and tabernacling himself in a people yeah when i'm at your home i'm there to get full you've invited me to come over and eat my fill so paul's desire then in ephesians 3 9 was was that we might be filled with all the fullness of god jesus said in in matthew 26 and 20 uh 20 chapter 26 verse 26 and 27 take eat this is my body and take the cut and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it amen amen amen these aren't just accidental wording there's not a single word in the bible that's an accident it's all purpose written by a god with a purpose and he wrote it like he wrote it on purpose and he wants you to believe it on purpose so that when you get a body change it'll be on purpose you won't stumble into it it's not an accident hallelujah you can't accidentally have it you've got to be driven by the purpose of almighty god [Applause] so take heat as paul said that you might be filled with all the fullness of god jesus said take heed this is my body he took the cup and gave them he gave it to them saying drink you all of it as wonderful then as revelation 11 1 shows us that we find that it is preceded by revelation 10 8 to 9. give me that brother caleb put that up and we're going to look at it now now as he puts it up we can't we'll first catch the eighth verse all right very familiar to us and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again i'll just stay right there until i tell you to go to nine stay right on eight and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth now there's not hardly anyone in here who almost couldn't close their eyes and quote the next line so i asked for the little book don't turn yet caleb so i asked for the little book and he said to me it'll be sweet on your lips but it'll be bitter in your belly haven't we read that i've read that all my life until i realized i hadn't what's that verse 9 and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey the the and brother now watch brother branham says so so let me let me let me make this point to you that the bitterness is not the last thing he wants you to remember amen amen and i as a preacher every preacher i've ever heard and i'm pretty sure even brother branham on tape puts it in reverse order that it'll be i've heard it since a boy it'll be on your lips sweet as honey but when it gets down into your belly oh it's going to be bitter it's going to be hard it's going to churn and brother branham says here's what here's what bitterness in the belly means you ready when you have to digest it then it gets bitter everybody's against you everybody telling you you're a holy roller you're this that or the other see you're off your head so it's hard to digest it now watch but when but when you're testifying of his glory it's sweet in your lips that's all see and when you stand up in a meeting you say glory to god hallelujah oh when you're going through that great siege you know what a siege is that's what cinecrib encircled jerusalem and hezekiah had to keep the people encouraged because they uh siege you know you know you're not going to try you don't even build all of that siege equipment to just you know expend all your men rushing the walls and get them all slaughtered that's a last resort battle tactic what you want to do is wait them out starve them out discourage them you know tell them you're going to lose tell them you got to butcher them tell them you're gonna kill their family and their children and if they'll just open the gate you'll spare you'll spare everybody and you don't have any food and you're in a terrible trial and it's a horrible affliction give up it's a siege that's what the devil does when you're in the midst of a trial it's a siege of the enemy and he has surrounded your mind to say oh this problem and that problem and this problem and that problem and this person in that trouble and this affliction and nobody loves you and god's forsaking you and oh you're going to lose and you're going to die i'm here to tell you that's just the enemy in a siege tactic amen brother branham says but then when you're going through that great siege it's hard a prophet acknowledges it's hard but when you're out of that great siege you can testify of it then it's sweet in the lips that's right that's this book of redemption amen see so the bitterness of trials is first but friends remember that it is the bitterness of trials that teach us such beautiful things such beautiful wonderful they mature us they grow us they strengthen us you're going to help me preach tonight isn't that true i'm not making that up you're human beings you go through trials isn't it true that when we come through the siege and out the other side we look back yes it was painful yes it hurt yes i wouldn't wish it on my enemies but i i wouldn't change it for the world because i realize now that i've come through it i got victory and it's made me stronger and it's made me wiser and it's made me love god more bitterness isn't the last thing he wants on your on your in your memory he wants the joy of the lord and when you come through you have a testimony that the trial was sweet [Applause] see they mature us troubles they grow us they strengthen us so much so that they leave a a lasting sweetness in our mouth for having gone through them [Music] i speak from deep experience you could speak from deep experience today i was talking to my grandson today and we were talking about this very topic and i said you know giddy and i said you know at my age me and ma'am all we we've been we've been through a lot more trials than you we've been through a lot more heartaches and a lot of more heartbreaks and i can tell you that life sometimes doesn't seem fair and it's actually by design it's not ever supposed to be fair because this life's not even about this life i said don't don't forget that g don't forget that now this life is just a training ground that's all it is it's all about the next one coming where there's worlds and worlds of worlds of worlds where there's a plan where there's a kingdom where there's a christ where there's a royal family oh my friends i'm here to tell you our future is very bright i've experienced these kinds of trials many times personally and i look back on them and i i wouldn't wish one of them on any of you amen i went with some on my enemies because sometimes they were very bitter they were very hard to endure life seemed wretchedly unfair life seemed uh you know i i remember times when you know when my boys were little and and i'm not going to get telling stories tonight but but just you know and i remember that we made a decision you know and we lived in an area we lived right in an area where where where women working in the factories in the mills they went to work with their husbands and carried their lunch pail and worked side by side see and i'm not here preaching about you know work or women working i understand the needs of society i'm not even talking about that i'm talking there's greater and lesser greater and lesser noble things and brother brandon was against certain things of women working completely and so but then there was things that were allowances were made and so i'm not here to preach on that i'm just trying to give you a testimony that but i remember that we made a decision and all of our friends all of our other friends who were our age you know and he and some of them even younger than us and they were a couple of years they had been the younger generation and deb and i grew up we got married and then they grew up and got married and and by by that by the time you got you're an adult four or five years difference doesn't mean anything and you know how that goes and you know they they were all working and because they were all having a two income household i mean they had all the nicest trucks and all the boats and all the all the all the jet skis and all the land and and the horses and the and the and the vacations and the big bucks and here we were just struggling living in cold rental houses trying to make ends meet but we made a determination that i would leave the mother at home with my children and and and and the most she ever did one time in the wintertime went and went with some church sisters to clean burn houses for some company where they'd catch on fire and you go in and wipe off everything which is what you know she was used to doing and and she did that one time through one to a single winner but but other than that we had to watch our our friends and many of them younger than us excel and excel and just seemed like the sky was the limit and every week we were just barely making it every week barely making it borrowing a little money from a mother or dad here borrowing a little from a mother-in-law or falling in love here borrowing from a friend trying to make ends meet but you know you want me to tell you can i fast forward to today i go back to those couples and almost all of them are in the world almost all of their children are in the world almost all of their grandchildren are in the world and today i got a home that loves god and i got children that love god and i got grandchildren that love god i'm here to tell you i went god's way and it was a hard trial but i wouldn't change that trial for nothing i'm so glad that i stuck it out that way hallelujah when my boys come home from school and burst into the house and say mom there's a mother there to greet them i tell you there's no substitute for a mother she's the greatest thing ever invented hallelujah friends i've had times in ministry where people rise against you and i've had terrible things and lies said about me and and all you can do is take the high road you can't fight that stuff you have to let jesus defend you and he will he always will he always will and i am i am here to testify today that every time i was attacked wrongly and innocently i stood quiet and the lord defended me every single time and i've been through hard deep cutting times and trials amen but i look back on them and my wife and i talked about it today i said you know honey we wouldn't change one of those trials she said nope not one of them i wouldn't even go back and alter one i wouldn't i wouldn't change it at all because now on this side of the siege it's so sweet on my lips jesus has become so sweet to me i know i can trust him and and the only way to know that is by experience of things that we have to go through and that's why i say they mature us they strengthen us you know we had we stood and come on let's be honest here today amen had we had we stood at the head of our trials and afflictions and looked down the path and the lord would have let us you know see all the suffering we were going to go through and the hardships you know we'd have tried to go around it come on all you holy people wouldn't we hey we're all in this together we can be honest we'd went around it if the lord would have stood there at the trail head and said that's what's going waiting out i said okay thank you and as soon as he left out i went okay though we'd miss the training we'd miss the growth we'd miss the maturity uh that that that was given to to bring us growth and maturity the trial that was given to bring us these things we'd never walk down the path of pain willingly no no no we're human beings we want the path of least resistance standing at the trail head of a deep trial friends now let's be real honest i would certainly try to avoid it amen but the lord in his kindness doesn't show us amen he doesn't show you what you're going to suffer what happens is we find ourselves in it we get through it and we're grateful to him for it this is just as much a part of eating the book as passing from death to life as getting a new body change as becoming the word made flesh in this day this is part of that process just as much as holiness living and the ways that we live and the things we don't do and don't go and don't say and don't participate in i'm here to tell you something friends we're not here to ask the lord jesus never promised you it would be easy only that it would be worth it yes amen see because the trail that we're on though it may be very troublesome but i want to tell you where it leads hebrews 12 22 but ye are coming to mount zion and unto the city of the living god isn't that beautiful you got that caleb hebrews 12 22 but we are common to mount zion unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels you know i i had a really nice trip here recently and i've never done a lot of wilderness hiking and we took off out west to see my sister and john and martha there are big hikers and they they took me on some trails and and my i so enjoyed it this was after i'd had that episode and i wanted to just see you know if the doctors if what they were saying was true that i should be able to go right back to it and i was i was able to you know run up and down those trails and really was watching my heart rate and i was just so enjoying it but i learned some things about hiking you know when you're standing at the trailhead of some long trek through the wilderness you're always going to have like a map and they're going to have signs you know no you can't have a dog on this trail you can't smoke on this trail you can't take alcohol you can't camp you can you know no no motorized vehicles you'll have all these signs and placards and then you have you'll have the map and you have elevations you have turns you have distance and when you're standing there you know you're looking at that map and as you study the turns and the elevations and the the total distance in and the total distance back and you know you have some natural wonder that you want to see and experience perhaps it's a some summit you want to stand on top of and look down over some sweeping vista some seascape some beautiful you know cascading valley and nature and and and and it's just uh it's a glorious release it feels like you're in the presence of god and but you know you don't do that you don't do that just willy-nilly not in the wilderness you might go over here to our little thing and walk on this nicely paved thing that goes along back here and you know you're not going to perish on that you're not even going to have a danger of it you're barely going to get your heart rate up on that it's all flat ground and uh you know so i said at least speed walk today man but but you know when you're going into the wilderness my goodness you know you you you've spent time gearing up you you've been very careful to examine your equipment you don't just take it for granted oh my equipment's fine no no you're going to the wilderness you better know you better spend some time examining your equipment you know you you've looked at you you've looked at the weather forecast for the region you've you've read the map you've looked at the turns you've considered the elevation you've looked at the distance you know the time it's going to take you know you've got radios cell phones you want to make sure you've you've been to the supply store you've and we did this that's how i know you do this we we went and we we spent money to make sure that we had all the necessary provisions you're gonna need energy bars you're gonna need a lot of water and it'd be great if you have a backpack has a water bladder in it and all of these different kinds of things you want to make sure you got the right kind of shoes the right kind of equipment and and and you know and it was so so that so that if it's a lengthy hiker if you're going to camp you're not caught off guard if because something can happen and something usually does and you gotta you gotta have a backup see and so you know are we now here we are today and our trail is headed to mount zion amen but i wonder sometimes are we provisioned not for trails let me just invert let me just invert two letters in the word not you know provision for not trails but trials are we provisioned for the necessary trials uh you know that are necessary to walk if we are to reach mount zion are you provisioned do you read your bible do you listen to tapes do you come to church do you have fellowship do you have fellowship with your family around the word of god are you provisioned amen are you just carrying on you just use church one or two times a week you know to kind of get a little appetizer to get you to the next one brother bennett's call that a camp star they people just run to one camp after another i say to the young people don't run to a youth camp after youth camp after youth camp trying to get the new birth get it be done get sealed cross over hallelujah don't wait for our coming revival we got more meetings coming we're going to have more revivals don't sit and wait for that and say i'm going to really get a hold of god i'm here to tell you the trailhead you're standing at might not wait for that revival you better be prayed up now see the food of revelation 10 9 that we read take the book and eat it and it shall be in thy belly bitter but upon thy lips it shall be sweet as honey the food of revelation 10 9 is the exact same food that jesus spoke of in our text in john 6. amen it's the exact same food whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day but now you notice something that we also read in revelation chapter 14 you remember this and there followed another angel saying babylon has fallen has fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication i'm here to tell you something friends mankind has reached a unique hour that has never been in the earth you've got the perfect word and you've got satan's eden and you've got a beast system and mankind is facing two choices and two choices only you either will eat the body word of the son of man with its life-giving nutrients or you will drink the wine of the wrath of her fornication and i'm here to tell you her wine has no life-giving sustenance i want you to know that young people it has no nourishment no minerals no spiritual vitamins for you her wine has no life-giving substance or sustenance whatever only a drunkenness that will lead you to destruction amen and there followed another angel saying babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication but i want you to know something friends if we eat the body word of the son of man you not only you not only get all the food and the nourishment and nutrients that you need but it's also the drink you don't need her wine because jesus said for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed i want to say in the words of jesus drinking all of it that's the that's the problem that too many people have they're not drinking at all i don't know i don't know the path of heartache uh you know that that he may take you down but drinking all of it i don't know what might happen tomorrow i don't know what sad story you might hear i don't know what trial you might go into or you might continue into from one you're in right now but drinking all of it hallelujah eat upon the body word of the son of man because his body is his food indeed and his blood is drake indeed hallelujah it won't leave you hungover from drunkenness it'll leave you with joy unspeakable and full of glory it'll leave you with stimulation of revelation it'll give you a peace that passes understanding i don't care what the trial is i don't care what the affliction is eat upon him drink upon him how many want that tonight how many won that part of revelation eat the book take it it'll be bitter in your belly but don't worry joy comes in the morning it'll be sweet and honey when you have a testimony when the siege is over amen i want you to know something friends the devil can't hold you in the siege forever oh night follows day joy comes it's dark as just before the dawn joy comes in the morning for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood is drink indeed why don't you stand with me tonight friends and say lord i want to have that water that flows from the rock i want to have the body word i want to eat the book i want to become the book i want to have my whole life committed to it lord god may you grant it to us master lord made tonight this little simple word come to the people lord may it give them courage father there's only two options may every person in here realize tonight there's only two options amen you eat the body of the sun or you eat the flesh and you drink his blood you eat the book you eat the lamb's book hallelujah you let it have its work in you lord teach us that we don't just eat it and oh my we get this wonderful knowledge and we get this wonderful revelations we get this wonderful theology no when we eat the book the more we eat the trial may get worse the more we drink of you the trial may deepen but oh god that's the very source of our energy that's the very source of our life it will come through the siege will end oh god you come down there and the prophet told hezekiah don't you worry god is going to deliver you went out there to that sin of you went out there to that egyptian monarch lord and you scattered him you defeated him drove him off and israel was saved oh god help tonight father and there's many no doubt in sickness and many in trials lord but your hand is upon it all o god and we love you for the reality of the word that we have i pray you will let us be believers of it tonight lord let us receive the engrafted word how many want to receive that is raise up your hand to him say lord let me receive the engrafted word let it be my meat let it be my drink let it be everything i'm not interested in drinking the wine of the wrath of her fornication because lord that is going to be the the fall of all humanity babylon has fallen has fallen she's already fallen once and she's going to fall again at the end time lord the head that was wounded but father she comes back at the end time if she doesn't come up out of this out of the waters like in old europe she comes up this time out of the land right here in america lord god she he's the god of this evil age it's this is completely satan's eden it's overrun the lid is torn off of hell demon powers are streaming we lord we learned about our realms and our dimensions on sunday past lord god these things are real they're not just stories but father there's also a realm of angels there's a realm of the redeemed there's a realm of christ oh lamb of god may it come real to us i pray help us tonight lord may father i when i was looking at that this morning i was almost speechless i saw thought my goodness my whole life i've read that in reverse and and in doing so it's always been a little bit of a hesitation oh man yeah it's going to be sweet we're going to love this revelation it's going to be sweet on our lips but oh boy then it's going to get better my goodness but lord in your love you're not you've not designed our trials so that bitterness is the last thing we taste no you've turned bitterness into sweetness you want sweetness to be the last thing we remember that no matter how deep the trial was or how deep it is or how deep it will be when i come through the siege it'll be sweet it'll be honey on my lips oh i'll sing a victory song i'll shout and praise god because i can because i'm i'm i'm the i'm the measurable perfected tabernacle i'm the living tabernacle of the living god's presence measurable perfection headed for home home at last we love you today master we thank you for these wonderful things we give it to you in jesus name amen praise the lord let's um let's let's sing you ready to

experience and now he's driving and and he says you know he said i there was still just something not fully there and that's exactly how brother branham explained it your justification sanctification then you go on to receive the baptism of the holy spirit you don't just have a justification experience you don't just get cleaned up and start going to church and stop lying this is about receiving the life and it had to make a really hard decision and separate himself from friends and associates who weren't believers and he said lord if i have nobody my whole life and if i'm alone the rest of my life i'll have you and i'm gonna serve you and it doesn't matter how the storm is if i go to heaven and i don't ever have anyone else i'm gonna serve you and i will praise you in the storm and he
