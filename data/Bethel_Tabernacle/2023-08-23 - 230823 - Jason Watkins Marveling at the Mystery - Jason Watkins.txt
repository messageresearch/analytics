praise the Lord God bless you turn around and shake hands with somebody standing near you with some God's great blessing amen amen hallelujah got a number of prayer requests we're going to get to uh tonight just in a little while amen praise the Lord we're going to invite you to Revelation chapter 17. amen it's going to catch the first seven verses of Revelation 17. praise the Lord At Last marveling At the mystery been working well that's I don't know that I can make that claim I got the thought of this it all came out of the heavens a couple of weeks ago at least the beginning of it all day today has been the continuation of the outpouring so I wasn't um too sure that that's the way I would go but it just was a unending Fountain so I just went with it and glad I did I have really enjoyed studying this thought today so I've covered your undivided attention for just a little while I know it's Wednesday I won't keep too long but it's just a little bit of a diversion from my series amen that we've been working on on restoring Eden so uh rebuilding Eden so we're looking tonight at marveling at the mystery revelation 17. and verse 1. and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sitteth upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was a raid in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and the Abominations of the earth that's quite a title and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration that's shocking having just seen what he had seen and having been told what he was told by the angel who had one of the seven vials this is I'm not teaching on it tonight but if I were working on a study in Revelation chapter 17 opens with the messenger of this age coming to John he's one of the messengers of the seven vials just just to jog your memory you remember that brother Branham back when we taught on the vows brother Branham taught on the vials people just don't realize that because he didn't call it that but he named a series and he said in here we're going to get to these vials and by the time he comes to the end of it he says now I hope you understand the vials better and I did I had a tremendous much once I knew that's what he was doing and remember that the seventh vial has already been partially opened brother Branham threw a rock up in the air voice of God said to him take a rock and throw it in the air and say thus saith the Lord judgment striking the west coast and brother Branham said now from that moment the judgments will just I forget his exact language the judgments will just keep rolling and it'll roll all the way into the tribulation listen friends the woes have already started the seventh vial has already released into the air no wonder you see the madness an insanity out there in the world because it was a plague on men's Mind released in the air so there's no way to get away from it if you breathe you get it a man mask won't help you no vaccination except this praise the Lord so this is clearly and I just want to say it intentionally distinctly you are reading in verse 1 that is William Branham unmistakably unquestioning there's no way to challenge that in the Bible it's clearly the angel to the seventh age that is absolute in the Bible and now he says here in verse 6 and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration so John represents the bride so I would say this is something we need to take a warning from you understand I want to point out to you that neither his seed Gene nor his Upper Room experience stopped him from admiring this religious system the only way he got his head on straight was the angel corrected him all right more on that in a minute and the angel verse 7 said unto him wherefore didst thou Marvel fair question I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman and of the Beast that carreth her which hath the seven heads and ten horns that was the ministry of William Branham that's what he did he explained who the mystery of this the mystery the Beast that she rode was a power and who the who the Beast was who the false prophet was who the Antichrist is they probed at it they all a lot of them probed at it a lot of reformers probed at it and and got some of it right and even John wrote that her you know death follows him we know that we know that that's that much we know but it took the prophet of the last day to identify exactly precisely authoritatively who it was so that you could authoritatively avoid it amen all right let's pray Master we thank you for the wisdom that you have given us in the word we thank you for the insight Lord we're not caught unawares we're not caught we shouldn't be anyway caught off guard by these things we we're not troubled Lord it is troubling to see the craziness in the world very troubling but we're not troubled we are as Paul said cast down but not forsaken we we do go through these things and we're right there with the rest Lord when when when when Israel was captive in Babylon everything any Calamity that the nation of Babylon suffered Israel had to suffer along with it but they were still your redeemed people so we you get you brought them out of there Lord and you're going to take us out of here and I'm glad for that so I thank you tonight and I ask that you give us real uh understanding in the word of God tonight give us courage Lord to look at it to face it it took me today a great deal of Courage Lord as I went through to study it father so I'm I'm praying now for all of us we're remember we're but dust and I ask for your mercy on our lives in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated praise the Lord um let's go ahead and put my oh thank you sir that's my title slide and I want to by the help of the Lord take this subtitle the seducing spirit of the Modern Age don't you think less than that it is a seducing seductive sultry tempting Spirit of this age and it seeks to draw even God's family and lure her away from the clear-cut uh lines of demarcation between the real Holy Ghost and an impersonation of it the real real Christianity and an impersonation of Christianity that's what the Holy Ghost is given for he's not mistaken over his word he's not mistaken over his bride aren't you glad he's not mistaken over his Messengers he's never had to repent for anything he's never had a bad idea amen Christ has never had a bad idea he's never sent forth a word and had to had to send out a recall foreign good to see you I thought I recognize that voice he's never had to send out a recall [Applause] back in uh there's something that's in that that could be a health hazard and maybe catch you on fire or cause you to crash there's no recalls needed the word of God Has Come to Us perfect every every member of his family that has ever been in the earth came into the Earth as a member of his family lived in the Earth as a member of his family Departed the world as a member of his family they had all kinds of ups and downs we have all kinds of ups and downs all right but but I'm but I'm my confidence is in whom I have believed I don't put my confidence in myself I put my confidence in him who called me who chose me who ordained me you tonight have the grand privilege to know that your Redeemer Lives that you can know that for a certainty and it's not a head knowledge sister Debbie and I were listening to a take today that I didn't remember hearing if if I ever have it's been a long time it was fortunately I didn't know if it would the audit would be clear it's from 1955 a very good tape called where Pentecost went wrong or where Pentecost made its mistake something to that effect on November 11 1955 and brother Branham is is he's got about at that point he's got about 13 months to turn Pentecost around or she's going to cross a line and America with her after 1956 that's it and going into 1957 a prophet says in 56 this is her last opportunity and here he is at the end of 1955 and he's preaching his heart out he's pleading with Pentecost in the most humble way softly speaking to them to say you know you know you know where we've made our mistake it should be obvious to us where our mistake is and he just went into the word and I'm going to tell you it's an amazing I I just paused it I said to my wife I said it is astonishing to me that anyone could hear the sincere heart of this man pleading for the cause of Christ humbly and with such feeling of love and compassion for the audience and those people who would hear it and and how anyone could turn that aside and how anyone could think anyway in any way less than that this was surely one of the most lovely humble Ministers of the Gospel that the Lord had ever sent to the Earth and yet he couldn't turn it around he couldn't turn it around he tried to turn it around but he couldn't turn it around it was not going to be turned around you say no then then a greater Prophet needed to come hey Jesus came himself to try to turn Israel around and he couldn't do it see and and so so we realized that God is still in control of it all but here we find John in the representation of the Bride As Brethren taught us in the in the Book of Revelation he marveled he found himself greatly admiring this religious system of the end time don't forget John was caught up to the in the to the Lord's day which means he was caught up to our day that's the Lord's Day the day of the Lord is the day of judgment it's a finality it's the it's the completion of all the ages John was caught forward and even God said now even God said I'm gonna even when he showed him the ages and he takes him up and he says now I'm going to show you what must be hereafter and so literally he gave John a front row seat and he gave him a prophet tour guide a prophet from the future who John tried repeatedly to worship but who a hundred percent of the time refused worship and redirected it back to God as any true Prophet would so John representing the bride he's he's admiring this religious system of the end time Cinder a prophet from the future a carbon-based human prophet told him that he should not Marvel or wonder or admire her that the blood of the martyrs was under her skirts that she was a beast a very terrible Beast who who who Wars against Christ at every turn and the prophet is saying to him don't be impressed and I I give you the pro I give you the the prophet's words to the bride to John of the last day don't be impressed with this world's order it's a sinful order don't be young people don't be impressed with the sinful order of this world don't be drawn in because it's a beast system now in no way are we limiting this tonight to the Church of Rome it's not limited to the Catholic Church you know man-made religion man-made religion is only a front for this satanic influence that is upon the world today he uses listen he uses beautiful religion to deceive the people that's the scriptures he uses Beauty he uses religion he uses beautiful religion to deceive the people that's the secret that the messenger uncovered and boy don't you know the devil didn't like being outed like that but prophets have a a nasty habit of outing the devil in every age and they're always coming to identify the true and living God and to clearly show who the Antichrist is and this Prophet was no different that it takes the whole world into deception as the Book of Revelation shows us they shall all worship Him whose names were not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world the whole world the Bible says that shall worship Him whose names were not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb the very fact that it takes the whole world into its deception is evidence that nobody thinks the messenger was right they believe in Mass he was mistaken [Music] in order to get John the bride at the end time not to do that not to fall for that the angel revealed The Mystery of the Beast he come into this age with simple Kentucky grammar and rather than use some Greek and Hebrew mashup to explain to you who Satan was brother Branham in his Kentucky wake just says he's a slicker he's a slicker had somebody call me that one time I almost punched them off their feet I went in and probably put on raggedy clothes just to not have that appearance but it's not an appearance it's an attitude it's a it's a spirit it's a it's something that transmits it's something it's an aura see it's a deceptive uh spirit and brother Branham called him a Slicker he said Satan is a slicker said he he's not some ghoulish monstrous with horns and a pitchfork and a red tail he said he's a Slicker and he he impersonates Christianity and I I just wonder tonight are you on the lookout for that because we're talking about a deception on a scale like the world has never seen and a deception so close to the real that it would deceive even the elected if that were possible so we're not talking about something you know that looks like the devil we're talking about something that looks kind of like Christianity it feels kind of like Christianity it appeals to your emotions and appeals to your mind and appeals to your senses and can almost make you think that you know we're all the same we're not we're not God's family has never been the same as anyone else in the earth in any age of History she's separate she's called out she's chosen she's peculiar she's weird and nutty by the world's standards wear that with pride I'll say you today be a nut with pride say well I'm screwed to the right bull I know that see so I'm not talking about now you know when I say are you are you on the lookout for this I'm not talking about living in fear not talking about walking around in fear conspiracy anxiety you know it's it's now I want to say this it's not it's not about burying your head in the sand and denying legitimate satanic conspiracy because that's part of the ruse see you're talking about a conspiracy brother Branham calls it a trinity of power it's the ultimate conspiracy and and he says it's a trinity of political power religious power and Demon power we don't fear him because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world you say Amen to that so so but but but I will say to you you know tracking it and worrying about the conspiracies that go on today friends that's a recipe for uncontrollable anxiety uncontrollable you'll never get past it take all the meds you want see all the doctors you want it's a neurotic age and the doctors are giving doctors meds brother Brown said that in the 60s psychiatrists are treating psychiatrists see these things are all well known and and movie stars and sports stars and music stars and they all have to have therapists and psychiatrists and drugs and sometimes they go over the edge and those doctors end up killing them it's a mad world and we're I'm glad to not be a part of it I'm glad that God is in control of all things and all men so we are not to live in fear he's not just the god of Good Men he's the God of all men but but but but are you are you cognizant of the fact that this deception that was prophesied to appear at the end of time which how many believe were there this deception that was to appear it this deception not North Korea or China or Russia this deception is the greatest existential threat human kind has ever faced this threat is so so big it looms so large that it's going to take Humanity to a complete Extinction event no World War has ever done that no Tyrant no dictator no world power no nuclear bombs no nothing has ever done that this is the greatest threat the world has ever faced the effect it can have on your life uh is it can can be Indescribable if you let it get a toehold in your life see the deception and and let me let me say it like this as it relates to the Bride of Jesus Christ because I've got some quotes you'll be familiar with about how that this bride's predestinated to not fall she can't be deceived because she's elected as Jesus said it would deceive the very like if that were possible we'll look at that in a minute but but we know what this deception is going to do to the world I'm really not preaching to the world I'm actually preaching to believers and when it comes to the Believers the deception that's the one that you've got to worry about I already know you're not gonna join a denomination for real of course I won't I already know you won't have anything to do with organized religion I'm not here to tell you what you already know I'm here to tell you that as a Believer the deception to watch out for is to mentally minimize sin and carnality of the Beast system controlling the world and the effect that that can have for you to mentally minimize in your mind you minimalize you minimize carnality you minimize the sin or it doesn't matter oh it matters the effect it can have on your lives or should I say more desperately on the lives of your loved ones that you're supposed to protect and Lead who came into the world with a little innocent sinful nature that came from you by the way just saying I got that from you and you're gonna give them a double whammy you bring them into the world through a way that birthed him with never giving their permission they're born into a world in sin and then you don't even have the decency to keep them away from carnality and sin see more often than not it happens when you minimize the significance and the authority of the messenger sent to warn you talking to believers not here to preach to the world tonight preaching to believers I'm going to say it again more often than not it happens when what happens when people mentally minimize sin and carnality in their homes and their lives and their activities they do it they do it in their lives they do it around their loved ones who are looking to them for example more often than not it happens when you minimize the significance and the authority of the messenger sent to warn you what do you suppose would have happened had John done that John is minister google-eyed he's Smitten by this modern impersonation of Christianity did I read it did you read it with me he says it that's his words I greatly admired and the angel are you kidding I I I I want I will tell you what she really is the blood of your brothers and sisters are just under her skirt she's drinking their blood this is an impersonation of Christianity nothing to do with that John you have nothing to do with that bride we are separate unto God how many want to live in the in the regions where God lives you want to live up there in those spheres yet that's on you God's willing to bring you up there but you've got to be willing to lay aside you can't minimize these things you got to get rid of them and get them out of your life brother said that's for whoever wants to live up there in those in those spheres with God brother Branham in our first quote says thirsting for life is that scream darkened somehow it doesn't look very bright but um if you can fool with it without interrupting me fine if not with weight collfter service thirsting for life that's a grand title isn't it I wouldn't sell my Birthright in Jesus Christ for all the television and popularity there is in the world can I modernize that you care if I might you won't kick me out the message will you I wouldn't sell my Birthright to be a YouTube Star I wouldn't sell my Birthright to get thousands of likes on Facebook I wouldn't sell my Birthright to have the most followers on my Instagram or all of those uh endless social media connections I wouldn't sell my Birthright to be Head of the Class or or the homecoming queen I wouldn't sell my Birthright surely sisters you wouldn't do that surely Brothers you wouldn't you wouldn't sell your Birthright listen surely you wouldn't miss heaven for the world I wouldn't sell my Birthright in Jesus Christ for all the television and popularity there is in the world no sir life means more than that the more than these nasty ungodly things I'd rather have favor with Christ than to be the president of the world what a condition the world's gotten into that's 1957 can you Echo that what a condition the world has gotten into faith is our victory you're going to wind up at a destination one of these days this is every Mortal that's going to be in the Valley of the Shadows of death I would advise you at this hour to prepare to meet God that will have to meet you at that hour you'll either meet him as a masterpiece that he has worked on or a floating piece of Driftwood to go to your final destination so don't you use listen don't here's a prophet don't you use this life just to drift around and Float around and get a better job and address better and to get a new television or a better car life means more than that Hallelujah life means more than that sometimes Believers can get caught in that in that same thing this this fast-paced highly advanced civilization with goodness everything is at our fingertips everything you know I I was I was talking to my wife about you know in in agrarian days before the Industrial Revolution when you know we were Agricultural and we raised farms and you might have a 5 10 12 member family on a farm like Jacob back in the Old Testament and had all of his sons around and daughters and everybody had a job and everybody worked and and when the family had a need you know what everybody went into the field to work that's how you did it a family worked together to put food on the table and and today you can't hardly get teenagers to put their phones down to wash a dirty dish this is what the world has become it's Madness it's insanity like any unhealthy food we eat we gain unhealthy results do you believe that remember that that we eat and live I mean listen historically speaking and I'm not going to here to preach a history lesson but historically speaking we and I even have stuff I could read you for reference but we we literally it's proven that we in this High Advanced civilization with everything at our fingertips we eat and we live with greater substance than Kings and monarchs ever dreamed of living you have you have more substance and and nice things and access to things even even just spices in your cabinet that they used to have to fight Wars over but Wars over spices things that you can just go to the grocery store right now and fill a pantry with see the the curse at the end time is to be weaker and wiser from the Tree of knowledge that's the warning that we're under in this age you know and and if we're not careful if we're not careful Believers you still believe her if we're not careful Believers we we like John we can become drunk with the wine of her fornication like other churches have and you might be a son or daughter of God doing it you have to be careful we be because we can become drunk with the wine of her fornication Jesus said for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect right brother Branham says in Christ is the mystery but the even the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated to not to do it she'll be a token to the world God will you'll be like uh a trophy that God will be able to say when the world tries to say God is unfair God can just point to his bride say well how is she doing it because I'm not doing it for her I'm I'm living in her but she's the one overcoming see I'm not I'm not pushing her through a pipe I'm not pouring her into a mold and pouring her pulling around saying see my Overcomer pride no no she's doing that herself I sent a prophet and told her that there's some things I won't do for her she the bride will make herself ready and you will be an overcomer he gives you the word he gives you his Spirit he gives you church he gives you prayer gives you his Bible he gives you taste he gives you friends listen listen so so if you have found yourself mingling around with all of the false religion and you say well I'm not mingling around with that well where are you at tonight in service are you even here or oh I'm sorry did some some event some career some job keep you out of the house of God poor thing a career and a job God gives you and that's your gratitude for him and God gives you everything you have including the air in your lungs and you and he gives you children and you can't even bring him to the house of God my goodness when's the last time you set your children down and opened the Bible or played a tape see I'm I'm speaking to not necessarily anyone in here tonight so you understand this this goes around the world so but it but if the shoe fits wear it and if you don't like the shoe grow and it won't fit you see friends I get what brother Branham is saying here I understand that but can I can I point something out to you in the natural world of physical laws if I drink out of the same wine bottle as an unbeliever I'll get just as intoxicated that quote won't stop that that Bible verse right there won't prevent that John had the Holy Ghost right John John here is caught up into the Lord's day and has even got a prophet walking with him instructing him and he still falls into that trap if I drink out of the same if you run with dogs you get fleas if you drink out of the same wine bottle as the world is drinking out of I'm not saying you're not a believer I'm saying you're foolish it's the truth see and it shows up oh mine Lord help me to keep going so the Holy Ghost doesn't keep me from getting drunk on it the Holy Ghost keeps me from drinking it amen it doesn't prevent me from getting drunk if I drink it it just prevents me from drinking it see you go away and you wonder oh my how many times I've I've heard this in people whining and complaining over because the Lord had to take a paddle to him and they wonder why goodness or what's worse and what's more heartbreaking is they have to watch their children get a paddling for because the Lord had to teach them something the parents should have taught them and didn't and then the Lord has to teach it to him you're talking about pain in the heart of a parent that's that's pain when you see the Lord they have to suffer because the Lord taught him something you never taught them see and if you ever told it to him it immediately got erased in their mind because they saw you didn't live what you were saying I mean listen friends you know it it I know it can look like judgment I get that sometimes it can look like judgment but can I say to you tonight it's it's actually the love of God it's actually the love of God because you're predestinated to not fall because you're predestinated to not fall because that's true about you it's not judgment it's the love of God and I just say Lord pour that love on me I mean even brother Branham is being told at one time he he can't get his line tangled up in these kinds of days now of course that's because of a misuse of his ministry but I mean it's it's a blanket concern in life for all of us don't get your line tangled up in these kinds of times you're coming to the consummation of the ages you're the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come brother Branham talks about how that the Saints there and the in the early centuries that when they went in there to at the Council of nicaea trying to stand for the word of God trying to take a stand say well that was a noble thing brother Branham said they had no business going there that you they weren't going to turn them around polycarp learned that the hard way see maybe it's one of the reasons why a prophet couldn't choose him though many theologians chose him over ireneus but brother Brown says no irenius was the messenger because polycarp leaned just a little bit too much to organize religion he just had that little bit of coloring and irenius was militant against it and so so we find that brother Adam said they had no business being there and and that's why that's why brother Branham goes into the scripture when it came to the Feast of Bel peor and that was when Moab holds a big a big Moab holds a big church service and they're they're trying to they're trying to get Balaam to curse Israel that doesn't work that's never going to work and so Balaam says well I told you I couldn't do it in the beginning and and if you offered me more money a goodness if you offered me all the money in the world I can't curse what God has blessed but I can tell you how to trick them hold a big Feast call it a big religious day and invite him to church and Israel fell for that not all of them but some of them some of them were even princes and you know what happened to them they went in there and they got sucked in and God looked upon and they were and and right away they started questioning the authority of the messenger now how do you know that well because one of them happened to come back with a a moabite hooker walked right past Aaron and Moses like you don't have no authority over me and took her into the tent and the and Phineas grabbed up a javelin and winning after him and finished them and God said that Phineas I'm so proud of you your line will be priests to me forever but you can see that that that kind of a moving in those circles caused the message to be reduced in their mind and the authority of the messenger who told them don't go don't have nothing to do with that how many know their Bibles see so I I I know that we should not be Tangled with the world young people don't be Tangled Up don't get tangled up in social media and and all it's going to do is feed you this woke agenda that should be the last thing on your mind is this woke left left woke agenda that denies God and denies the authority of the Bible and denies everything that we hold dear and and inverts families and destroys the nuclear family and puts a woman out of her place and a man out of his place and young people out of their place no wonder children in the last day will rise up to torment their parents that's prophecy husbands and wives should not be Tangled Up in this layout of sin economy chasing the wrong things for gain come on friends I'm an old-fashioned believer but I believe the word of God is true and I believe it tells Families how to live how to operate how husbands and wives should be how children should be in the home how there should be respect and everybody should be contributors I believe in the old-fashioned power of God in a church I believe that families ought to be spiritual they ought to come in here praying you ought to come in here rejoicing you ought to be able to welcome the Holy Spirit then we can see impossible uh cancers destroyed then we can see homes repaired and marriage is repaired and young people filled with the Holy Ghost I say we sell out to the word of God whatever what about it Bethel Tabernacle I say we sell out to the word of God Hallelujah when we look at this these two scriptures I don't know if I could put two more opposite Polar Opposites than these two scriptures one is the judgment that you read about in The Book of Revelation only here it's a record a part of it's recorded in Matthew 25 that Revelation doesn't doesn't make you privy to Jesus covers it this now is that false Church coming to say we have all kinds of works that we've done we were a beautiful church we did all kinds of a command all kinds of accomplishments and we had programs and and family and you know what Jesus doesn't deny that they did those things he just simply says they don't count because you they were iniquitous works and you knew all the time that your heart wasn't right you knew all along that your heart wasn't right and therefore he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not now can I say this to you if he didn't know them they didn't know him what does God were talking about if he didn't know them then they didn't know him either I'm not talking about he was he was not aware of their presence in the earth he gave them life ain't talking about their their their carbon-based body he knew they were there he gave him an opportunity and dealt with them in life it's not what we're talking about what we're talking about is that they never ever in all of their religiosity and all of their beautiful religiousness they never had a relationship with Christ at any level now the foolish virgin did they were actually saved and they didn't even know how they got saved they didn't even remember doing those things for him I mean I'm glad I'm sure they were glad they did it Lord I'm I mean I'm glad I did it but I kind of don't really well just just I really don't remember doing it but but you you see that what the Lord was pointing at in the story that Jesus is telling is that what determines this is why God looks at the heart what determines was their heart's response to the word at whatever level God revealed it they caught it and believed it and ran with it and it was genuine and it was real and the Bible calls them Sanctified ones the Bible calls them saints in rev in the Book of Revelation in Matthew 25 Jesus the king calls them righteous you see so these are Sanctified living people who lived Sanctified lives that's your foolish virgin not the impersonation of Christianity not saying people can't cross from one category to another many of us came out of those systems and came into the revealed word not saying they can't be move on and get out of that come to their senses before it's too late that's why I'm preaching that's why we're on the internet trying to reach them and tell them you're you're deceived you're you think you're okay you're not okay but my message tonight is to Believers you know you might not be okay either if you're drinking out of the same goblet as the religious world as the impersonators of Christianity if you're drinking out of that you're getting drunk with them me so he says I knew you not I I know you not now look at the exact opposite Ephesians 1 6 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved I'd say there's a pretty start one of me don't know him at all and the other ones have been accepted in the Beloved he goes on Paul here in Colossians giving thanks unto the father catch this now giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in say it with me light so how do you how do you find right standing with God you have to be a Child of the Light so when the light comes you have to accept it see it's so powerful that even the foolish virgin who aren't ordained to see all the light are saved just by agreeing with what life they do see that's how powerful it is who hath delivered us catch it from the power of Darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom into the kingdom of his dear son verse 14 in whom in whom we are in Christ we have Redemption who has Redemption those who are in Christ how did I get in I followed the light I receive the light if we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin see so so the prophet sent with the spirit of Elijah now I I want to I want to I want to turn a corner all right I'm gonna turn the corner you good so a prophet who came to us with the spirit of Elijah say well you really are emphasizing that aren't you I need to because where we're headed okay so I want it in your mind the prophet sent with the spirit of Elijah called out entertainers he called them out by name most prominently he repeatedly called out Elvis Presley Pat Boone and Ernie Ford and he called those names publicly Elvis Presley Pat Boone's and Ernie Ford now he declared that Elvis Presley became a modern day Judas Iscariot because he started out in a Pentecostal Church he had a god-given gift God doesn't take those things back even if you misuse them he was given a gift that should have been into the in the control of the Holy Ghost for the benefit of God's family but brother Branham says that he became a modern day Judas Iscariot because he sold his god-given gift for Satan's use in exchange for a fleet of Cadillacs for a fleet of Cadillacs Fortune Fame and Glory in doing so he doomed himself and he doomed millions of teenagers and adults alike to the Lake of Fire by now it's likely tens of millions that's directly by extension it's probably many times that by extension of his influence it's very likely uh hundreds of millions of teenagers and adults have been doomed to the Flames of the Lake of Fire because Elvis Presley with a gift from God sold it for the devil's usage it doesn't it's not strange to me that that this would be the final prophetic identification Judas Iscariot that doesn't surprise me that a prophet would that his final words about Elvis Presley was that he was a modern day Judas is scared that doesn't shock me because I mean Elvis was the king of rock and roll but I I find it most interesting that he would call out by name Pat Boone and Ernie Ford Folk country and gospel singers and many times gospel singers good old boys soft-spoken large-hearted could make you really feel good listening to their even their Gospel tunes and they even had confessions of conversions and they went to church but here's an Elijah Prophet saying Elvis Presley and he's putting them in in one category Pat Boone Ernie Ford that he grouped them together under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost numerous times in the Pulpit I'm certainly listen friends I I'm certainly not Elijah and I'm I'm not even his assistant Elisha but but neither are we facing those Cub Scout level days so all things being equal I think I can go forward as a servant of the Lord [Music] having the same Holy Ghost and by the way with a Divine call you better believe that you better find another church see as a pastor as a believer as a preacher of this message I can say With all sincerity that that we might need to revisit this deceptive way of the devil in the way that he operated in Elvis Presley Pat Boone and Tennessee Ernie Ford as he tries and goodness gracious seems determined to try to do it again right here at the finish line but he answered I'm bringing you back to this but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not Hillsong does not know him as the bride knows him this is the impersonation of Christianity this young woman according to the Bible she is wasting her time to even pray a woman who cuts her hair that is a sign of rebellion to God and she can pray all day long God will not hear her prayers that means she doesn't even have access to having an audience with him she can't even if people say feels like my prayers aren't getting more higher than the ceiling hers truly aren't seeing this singer cannot even receive an audience with God to hear her prayers is she savable I hope so could she come to the knowledge of the truth God granted have mercy she looks like a very nice person see now where I want to make this clear we're not talking about a gift and I'm not even talking about their songs but just remember can I just say this for the sake of our worship leaders just to give you some instruction that sometimes you'll hear our worship leader sing these people's songs you know why that is because brother Branham said all inspiration comes from God a l l only thing that happens is it falls on an unre unregenerate vessel and it gets twisted that inspiration came from God we own that that's for me that was sent for me I have a right to go reclaim that song and redo it under a proper anointing it belongs to me so if they take the inspiration that came from my father and they wrote a song and jazzed it up and rocked it up so that you can't even you shouldn't even be playing it then we have the right and I I have the right with Holy Ghost filled uh worship leaders to say brother I have confidence in you you want to sing that song redo it you know how I want it to sound redo it because you're a holy ghost filled man and it comes out like it was supposed to come amen all right I just I just want to take up for my worship leaders for a second all right so but in this but but I'm just saying I'm not judging her heart I'm just saying right now she can't even get a prayer through but the deception is the deception is so strong because of the Charisma and the song and the music and the the melody and the beat and she's pretty and she sings like an angel and it literally like John it just causes John to go I greatly admired her until the prophet slaps him what are you thinking you good I hate to show this picture it's so vulgar don't get mad at me teenagers Lauren Daigle doesn't know him as the bride knows him I I don't even want to leave that up sincerity I have no doubt of that I'm not questioning her her motives could could it brother Jason goodness gracious you sound so judgmental I don't know why I I acknowledge sincerity I don't deny that at all I'm not saying she's a fake I I you say well could it could it be that maybe she's like brother Branham said maybe misinterpreted Theology and that's why she's like that sure sure that could be that could absolutely be I'm not here to say she couldn't come to an altar and get the real Holy Ghost and become a real lady before Christ brother Branham listen brother Branham I didn't put the quote up but I could have brother Branham talks about Jackie Kennedy and says that maybe if she had he didn't want to be judgmental of her he said because maybe she never heard one of my messages maybe if she would have heard one of my messages it would have been different with her and Jack said I certainly disagree with his politics but maybe if he'd have heard one of my messages things could have been different so I I'm not even talking about her songwriting ability for goodness sake don't turn me off because maybe I made you mad you don't know how many times I can preach an hour and a half sermon and somebody got mad over 27 seconds and if it comes at the front of the sermon they don't hear the rest of the sermon are we believers I'm not talking about her songwriting ability that's a gift of God she'll be responsible uh to to the one who gave it to her for who she allowed to anoint it she doesn't own the gift the gift is in her like the gift is in me to preach that's a piece of Machinery put in me at Birth I can't control that it just clicks on and starts working see I'm not the gift I I thank you praise the Lord praise the Lord I hope so I don't mind a rose now and then she will be responsible I will be responsible every minister in here every musician every worship leader will be response every every worshiper will be responsible for who you let anoint the gifts that lay within you just like her just like you I'm not saying she can't get saved I'm not saying it's not a you know I I mean I mean look I mean when I talk about the gift of God and her being responsible that's true for every born-again believer every child of God who has a gift from God I'm not saying she can't get saved I'm not preaching about God saving people I'm preaching about people under the deception of the end time making people believe they are saved when they're not right I'm gonna say it again I'm not preaching about being saved I'm preaching about the deception that tells them they're safe when they're not saved I'm preaching about Believers minimizing this kind of deception and blowing it off and will maybe even leave this service tonight and go right back with no effect no matter what the preacher says I'm not preaching uh uh like what you might think I am I don't want to see Believers minimize the deception say what do you mean by that okay let's just call let's just put it on put it put it right on it you know what does it mean to minimize you know this deception to minimize everything when I see people trying to copy it when I see people coming anywhere near that who claim to be believers that you're under a delusion by Satan amen that's not a Christian that's not godly that's not holy come on dear I mean do you feel that exposing naked sexuality is of the Holy Ghost be honest come on friends come on come on be honest young people be honest that's not holiness that's vulgarity I'm embarrassed to show it in the house of God and then to see believers kind of dressing kinda like that and having that loosey-goosey carnal lifestyle and you dress one way in church and then you dress a completely different way on Facebook you go to meetings and raise your hands and cry real tears and I grant you the real and then you go on Instagram and you're so vulgar I have to move the page quickly and you're supposed to be a believer you're not a Believer you're a hypocrite and you need to repent you need to ask God to have mercy on you you need to let the Holy Ghost come in and give you a refilling I'm not suggesting you haven't had experiences with the Lord you probably had lots of them you need a new one one side of me feels righteous indignation at this seductive trap that this is the deceptive allurement that brings upon the Bears upon the mind of our young sisters in the mind of our young brothers and even and and even more sadly as adults who wallow in it and I I I get my heart broken because I have to look at a picture and go like father like son like mother like daughter yeah husband over here was too weak and here he is the same it's just a it's the same Spirit living in a different body listen friends I'm trying to do one thing I'm trying to get you home I'm trying to get you in a Rapture I'm trying to get the Holy Ghost to move freely in your lives without without the Holy Spirit blushing when he comes into your presence did you know he could do that then there's the shock and all can I start preaching now then there's the the shock and all when I see even parents God help me not to break down I love children I love mine I love yours they're precious and right in the middle I see parents right in the middle of guiding Souls who are under their care parents who have been called into one of the most solemn and difficult duties that one could ever face in life raising the Lord's heritage raising them not according to your whims certainly not according to laodicea but raising God's Heritage in the admonition of God oh in the admonition of the Lord but yet shirking the duty that they have before God to mold these little innocent sinful nature lives in the direction of the word shirk that responsibility completely a responsibility that you have Mom and Dad a responsibility to help the Holy Ghost have a good chance to deal with them when they grow when I think about their little innocent lives they don't stay that way they grow up and then they start having problems none of us are perfect I don't think I think that I certainly wasn't perfect there's no one Perfect Adam and Eve had the most perfect parent you could ever want God they lived in a perfect place Garden of Eden they still fell I get that that can happen the devil's Wily but there's no pain like seeing your child suffer on something they can't get free of because you know you didn't hold the standard like you should have little children start life with no understanding at all of all of this if parents don't instruct them they start out they don't know nothing about it they're as innocent as can be they're a blank slate I mean what does it take to start with a blank slate and by the time you get 14 15 16 years down the road you've got a complete Anarchy and Rebellion how did you get how did you go from a blank slate to that and that took some Titanic failures see and they start life with no understanding and and and and they never they they they were they never were informed that Satan recorded their birth they never were informed that he opened a file on them the day they were born he's been plotting their destruction ever since they have no concept of that when that happens my heart goes from indignation to a terrible sadness and then I start thinking about what can I do to help What Can I Do Lord and I I know there I know they're not my children so I plead with the parents and I pray and I preach and I plead with them and it goes in one ear and out the other and nothing changes and years passed by and decades pass by in that little innocent Blank Slate grows up and now they're off headed into the world and and they've got their eye on the prize of oh you know let's be the king of the world let's whatever laodicea has because they never were taught that the world's burning down and not not to layer Treasures up here we're getting out of here and if I'm successful at that you know then I I A lot of times have terrible trouble pleading with parents to have spiritual homes to raise them to know God to teach them the ways of the Lord you know my motive can I say to you my motive and my objective in stepping on your toes and ruffling your feathers is whether you believe me or not my motive is not against you I'm trying to keep your children from appearing at the Judgment bar at all I don't want to see them in trial at all I want to see them on the throne listen oh goodness let me get back to my previous thought I gotta close it's Wednesday night and I promise I wouldn't keep you long got 10 more minutes I want to Circle back and just I get sidetracked on that stuff it's so I feel so passionate about it so if I've hurt your feelings didn't love me anyway because it wasn't my intention to hurt your feelings you know we we put up these two young women sewed their picture and you know I I'm not saying those women couldn't become true Christians I want that on the record Jesus died for them as much as he did for anyone listen God so loved the God so loved them both that he gave his only begotten son to save them just as much as he did for anyone I don't doubt their sincerity at all I'm not the judge of someone's heart only God knows that I'm not sent here for that reason not sent here to judge their heart I'm sent here to shine a light so could I say to you tonight as we wind down if you if you if you happen to meet either of them and you get the chance uh please in great love and great kindness please tell them that they're short of the mark if you go to their concerts and you just happen to get a backstage pass or you get to get an autograph can you please just in love and kindness tell them I'm shocked that you'd be at their concert but if you are laughs I just I'm sorry the Lord backed me up on that one I had to turn around on that please tell them that they have a ways to go to be accepted in the Beloved to be accepted in the Beloved they have a ways to go and I just say now can I say please make sure you're qualified to say it don't don't let the the voice of your life be different from the voice of your words because then all you'll do is confuse them even more they've already had charlatan preachers who wouldn't tell them the truth who wouldn't live an example in front of them so if you're gonna if you're gonna tell them that they're short of the mark that they're not going to get to the Beloved that they got a ways to go please be qualified I can say with lots of study and prayer on this sermon connecting myself to the mind of God that the heartbreaking story these people tried to get into the kingdom and it was just an impersonation of Christianity it's so sad you see I I I as I said to you earlier if he doesn't know them then they never knew him if he never knew them they never knew him and and and and and I realized that that they don't know him and and no matter what it looks like in their videos no matter what it looks like they don't know him they've never met him it doesn't matter that they cry real tears and raise real hands and have real sincerity Cain had all of that that's that's an impersonation of Christianity the Pharisees did the exact same thing listen it might shock you but sincerity alongside of iniquity is possible sincerity alongside of iniquity is possible they're proving that nature itself taught them that they were wrong but they wanted a religion according to how they wanted it to be and the reason that the carnality won't go out of their lives is because they have re they have diminished the authority of the Prophet that was sent to John to tell him don't admire her don't stay away from her it's an impersonation and when you have minimalized the the prophet that came to John right here this Prophet from the future when you minimalize his authority no wonder the carnality won't leave your life no wonder I still see what I see on social media on on men and women who claim to be message believers see so because they wanted a gospel how they wanted it as I've said to you before if you go for very long and you don't get a new birth you know there's 33 000 different versions of the gospel and if you don't if you linger and dilly dally and stay in the valley of you know decision too long and get spiritual Amnesia and you sit in mess you might sit at a message church for two or three decades and never even been born again because you think you're all right you're not because I can see you're not because you can live like that see and and and and so so so when we when we come to that listen friends there's only there's only one way to do it you've got to come to God sincerely and in deep honesty and because what will happen is that you'll finally hunt around until you find a version of The Gospel that you wish was true and there's plenty of examples out there to give you that and tell you you're a Christian or you're a Believer even a believer the message and and none of it's true it's not accurate that's just not true not that they can never know him but if they are to know him listen not that these young ladies can never know him but if they are to know him God uses his family to win other people so how what what chance do they have how are you going to go give them a message if you if you live similar to him and you look kind of like them see I'm not talking about their music not talking about their song not talking about their gifted they're gifted people not some other songwriter on top of other songs I'm not talking about their motives not talking about their objective not questioning their sincerity I'm not judging their heart I have no way to do that but they need to hear you got further to go if you want to stand in the Beloved so tonight you know if you are imitating them if you're imitating them how are you going to show them him I'm not trying to insult you I'm not trying to anger you I'm not trying to irritate you I'm trying to wake you up to the greater need of God's presence in your life I close with this it comes back if not I'll read it try it again okay I'll just read it I can't get it back it's all good it's the last two slides on the PowerPoint here we go the last two one up right there right there let me say something to you notice a title if I read the title out loud you believe in that come musicians while I read this let me say something to you brother and sister in first John the second chapter and the 15th verse we can read it if you wish to the Bible says that if we love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of God is not even in US now the word there is not Earth it's a Greek word is Cosmos which means the world's order see so if we love Fashions of the Earth the world if we love the trend of the day if we think this is a wonderful time oh we have all these things if you think that it's because your thinking is wrong it's because your thinking is wrong do I it's it is perverted by the devil can you absorb that your thinking is wrong if you find the allurement of the world operating in your life then then there's a pro your your love of God tank is way down low on you're running on fumes bow your heads with me I'm going to read this quote to you why your heads are bound [Music] your thinking is wrong I'm gonna back up keep your heads bound listen carefully here's a prophet here's that profit from the future that came to John and rebuked him for admiring the world John was a Believer just like you he was a seed Gene just like you but he got caught in it let me say something to you here's that same Prophet that was speaking to John brother and sister first John the second chapter the 15th verse we can read it if you wish to the Bible says if we love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of God is not even in US now the word is Cosmos which means the world order so if we love Fashions of the Earth the world if we love the trend of the day if we think this is all a wonderful time oh we have all these things if you think that it's because your thinking is wrong it's been perverted by the devil for if you love The World's order and the things of this present world it's because the love of God's not even in you remember that oh god look what we're looking into I'm going to pray for you you pray for me this might not be the sermon you expected on a Wednesday night you might not have thought I was going to go in this way by the title marveling at the mystery but if you find yourself marveling at the mystery that a prophet has already interpreted and unlocked it it's still a mystery to you if you're marveling at it once once the prophet told John what it was he stopped marveling once he informed John by a revelation John quit quit chasing that so rather than now keep your heads valid but listen real careful I'm gonna give you a life-changing instruction rather than spending all your time asking God to change you can I put a can I put a little line in your prayer just ahead of that can you start your prayer by saying Lord give me more confidence in the messenger you sent me give me the same amount of confidence that John the Divine had when your Prophet came to him and said don't admire her don't Marvel at her don't be captivated by her that's an impersonation of Christianity she's against Christ she only looks like beautiful religion but a prophet that came to John who represented the bride has come to you the very same one and he's given you the very same message so if you're finding it hard to overcome why don't you ask God to give you a fresh revelation of the authority of the messenger that God sent I'm telling you whatever he taught you you can Bank your soul you can sleep easy at night knowing that your children are being raised correctly knowing that if you say father there will be a father to answer yes my child that if you have a need he's a very present help in a time of trouble that if the Devil comes in like a flood don't worry God will raise a standard up against him I'm going to pray for you master I thank you for this service tonight it's went long Lord longer than I intended but I was under strict orders to finish this sermon if I had to stay here to midnight I tried to go forth as studiously as I could I tried to say everything you wanted said I believe I have have I have no regrets I I said it with a pure heart with love that's the truth if anybody thinks I if my if my righteous indignation came across like as if I'm angry well righteous indignation kind of looks like that but it's righteous because I'm zealous for God's word and I care about people and sometimes I feel like I just have to smash people to get them to open their eyes come to your senses Shake Yourself Samson the Philistines are upon thee Lord help us tonight help me helpless people there's an internet audience Lord I know that especially on Wednesday nights Lord I'm informed by our audio video team manager that Wednesday night we have the most Life Connections from all over I'm praying for them tonight Lord I'm asking for your mercy for all of our Lives Lord Jesus and help us father help us won't you give us a greater confidence in the messenger you sent help us to lay aside weights and sins help us to kick things out of our lives and out of our homes and kick them out once and for all and say I'm done with that I'm done with that carnality I'm done with it I'm walking away from it forever I'm going to walk into spirituality I'm gonna I'm gonna soar in the Spheres where God is I'm going to live close to him oh if you've got that in your heart tonight raise up your hand and say Lord that's me tonight oh God Hallelujah Jesus we thank you Lord God we thank you I pray Lord for the spirit of people you'll the word deals with their soul I'm praying for their spirit I don't want to see anyone feel offended never had that intention but what I've said has been said in honesty and it needed to be said it needed to be established and nailed down as the prophet said I've got to hammer it until the nail clinches so I commit it now to you I know nothing more to say or do I commit the balance of this service into your hands in Jesus name amen sing for us for them Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul Oh Come and gather with me friends I live for you alone every breath that I take every moment I'm away Lord have your way before I give you my heart oh give you my soul I live I live for you alone every [Music] oh yes [Music] one more time oh
