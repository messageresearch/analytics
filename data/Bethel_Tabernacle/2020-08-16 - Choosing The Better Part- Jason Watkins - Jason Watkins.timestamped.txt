[26:53] amen praise the lord want to um also
[26:56] just uh announce again i during the
[26:58] sunday school class
[27:00] for those of you who were streaming to
[27:02] hear that
[27:03] we announced a little bit of an
[27:05] acceleration in our teaching on the
[27:07] entire book of revelation
[27:09] going to accelerate it just a little bit
[27:11] here in the live service because
[27:14] a 25 minute window it's difficult to get
[27:17] down into the nuts and bolts of it and
[27:19] then
[27:20] you barely move at all you barely even
[27:23] finish a verse and we've got you know 22
[27:26] chapters to go through so
[27:28] uh during the podcast which we are uh
[27:31] finally or have underway
[27:33] amen we got our uh that was the finished
[27:36] edited version brother jason
[27:38] so we got our edited version back from
[27:41] uh for our introduction video on our
[27:44] podcast and we should be starting
[27:46] uh and part of the thing that i'm going
[27:48] to do along with
[27:49] several other different podcasts
[27:52] choosing the better part
[27:56] sat at jesus feet and heard his word
[28:01] but martha was encumbered about much
[28:03] serving
[28:04] and came to him and said lord dost thou
[28:08] not care that my sister hath left me to
[28:10] serve alone
[28:12] bid her therefore that she helped me and
[28:15] jesus
[28:16] answered and said unto her mark today
[28:20] may lord i just be completely
[28:22] surrendered to you
[28:23] at this hour and so i have felt your
[28:27] very
[28:28] intervening hand for this sermon today
[28:32] lord i've felt lord even almost a a
[28:36] complete interruption of my
[28:38] of my own plans for ministry today
[28:42] and so i know i know that i have your
[28:45] direction
[28:46] i'm not sure how panic that's even a
[28:48] slight
[28:49] uh interruption of our ability to
[28:51] breathe
[28:52] is very frightening so lord move for our
[28:55] sister right now
[28:56] i pray lord this church binding together
[28:59] that you will
[29:00] lay your hand upon her lord and we
[29:02] commit it to you
[29:04] in jesus name god bless you friends
[29:07] you can be seated
[29:27] hmm did brother brad pray for his
[29:30] his uh father-in-law uh
[29:34] let let's just pray again brother brad
[29:36] is just saying he has a prayer request
[29:38] his father-in-law
[29:40] brother tommy has coveted and his vitals
[29:42] are dropping and it doesn't look good
[29:44] for him the family is asking
[29:46] us to keep him in prayer amen
[29:51] oh so it's brother uh sister melissa's
[29:54] following brother jesse's dad
[29:56] okay and so was there prayer we're gonna
[29:58] pray again amen
[30:00] all right we'll pray for it okay all
[30:02] right it's from brother brad
[30:04] um yeah it was two two brother brad from
[30:08] sister melissa amen let's pray master
[30:11] lord we're thinking right now and
[30:13] joining in with our sister melissa for
[30:15] her father-in-law
[30:17] lord i pray right now you have mercy on
[30:20] him
[30:20] master lay your hand upon him right
[30:23] there lord and uh
[30:24] you know where martha lived of course
[30:26] was bethany there's other places in the
[30:29] scripture
[30:30] that that tell us that you can read in
[30:32] john chapter 11 in
[30:33] various places you'll find bethany was a
[30:37] notable city
[30:38] it's a few miles east of jerusalem
[30:40] actually and
[30:41] jesus actually in fact is jesus stayed
[30:44] in bethany
[30:45] uh during the final week of his life and
[30:48] so
[30:49] there's a sharp contrast in this story
[30:51] today
[30:52] uh between these two sisters martha
[30:56] and mary and we find that mary
[31:00] sat and listened to jesus while
[31:03] martha made preparations for meal
[31:07] and you know when she comes to the lord
[31:10] she's got a request in mind
[31:12] and you know she's saying can you can
[31:14] you please
[31:15] tell her that she needs to help me and
[31:19] you know jesus gives a gives a doubling
[31:22] gives a repeat of her name
[31:24] martha martha and this is whenever
