========================================

time to the studies of your word Lord we ask that your Holy Spirit would come and speak to us and teach us the Lord help us to get ourselves out of the way that you would be magnified and glorified and we would know how to live in this dark and evil age father we we asked your blessing upon each one commit these things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen so start a new subject today I'm titling it seven women take hold of one man and if you want to go ahead and pull that PowerPoint up and we're going to read in Isaiah chapter 4. strange title right so Isaiah 4 and you go ahead and go to the first screen and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of Israel amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he could be seated so looking in this verse I want you to I want you to see that number one um a woman is a type of the church so you see the woman in society you're going to see the direction of the church you're going to see sisters in the true elect that's the direction that the elector going right and so those things are parallel to one another let's look at some quotes brother Branham in recognizing your day and its message says they don't recognize second Timothy 3 where it said in the last days men would be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truce Breakers false accusers incontinent and despisers of those that are good the bride see having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof for this is the kind that'll go from house to house and Lead silly women silly women LED away with diverse lusts never learning or never able to come to the knowledge of the truth never they wouldn't do it and they won't do it God said so in blind Pharisee can't you see it I'm not angry I'm just driving the nail and then clenching it neither does the churches recognize that this the women can't understand it they're supposed uh silly women LED away with diverse lusts Hollywood all this kind of stuff Bob here wearing shorts wearing makeup all this kind of stuff which is Unbecoming do you know the woman plays a great part in the last days you know the Bible said that those who Escape out of this great damnation will be a beautiful Branch before the Lord sometime someday I'll get to it the Lord willing for it for you women all right so right there you see brother Brandon saying that that beautiful branch in our eyes we say well that isn't that Christ Christ is the beautiful Branch but brother Branham is showing us no that that is actually the bride in the last days she'll be glorious the scripture says let's go back to that scripture and I'm going to be referring to this a lot throughout this I want you to see so the first part we see the negative right so this is juxtaposed to each other so on one hand the world the denominations those who've committed adultery against the word this is what the condition will be for them but then in that day in the darkest of day in Satan's Eden in the worst age the most deceiving age the branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of Israel so I want I want to keep this scripture in front of you because as we're going this is what we're talking about you might say you're why are you so focused on the women don't think I'm so focused on the women because what we're talking about is bride so when I'm speaking about women condition of women feminism Satan's attack on the family all these things you think oh this guy doesn't like women no you're missing the point you're not seeing what's happening in society is reflective of what's happened to the church and what what's happening to you sisters is what's reflecting of all of us men and women in the bride right we're all bride it's not like we're Grooms and bride Christ is the only groom every one of us is bride having to submit to our husband right having to dress be dressed modestly be dressed in what he provides for us you see seven women are going to take hold of a man so taking hold means to seize there in other words we want you and we're going to use you for our purpose saying we're going to eat our own bread and we're our own Apparel in other words we're gonna we're gonna have our own jobs and we're gonna we're gonna go out into society and we're going to do exactly what we want to do just we don't want to have a reproach we want to be called by your name now you're thinking about it when I'm talking about this in the natural but let's look at it in the spiritual as we go forward see if I can get past this let you see what God thinks of the woman that really escape this damnation of this day said she would be beautiful I heard a woman the other day laughing at a girl a bunch of half-naked females with morals lower than a mother dog laughing at an old woman with a long dress listen here your little twisted up female she's got something you know nothing about she's got moral you don't even know what the name is you lost it in the Cradle almost you don't even know right from wrong she does she's got something hit in her heart that you don't know nothing about you lost it can never find it don't you call her old-fashioned and so forth you see look at this is what the devil does he'll he'll he'll call you names you're oh you're you're under the thumb of a man you're under the patriarchy and we're supposed to get scared by this terminology you're old-fashioned yeah exactly that's right I'm under the word of God that's where I'm at that's where I want to be but they want to call names and it's supposed to trigger us into fear oh just shut up and sit in the corner no we're gonna speak the truth and live the truth and we're not going to be afraid to be called old-fashioned and part of the patriarchy and blah blah blah says you're uh she's she's got hit in her heart Treasure of decency you don't know one word of it you're mad me brought you up like that your pastor permitted him it shows where he stands I'm a preaching about him right here now see it said seven women will grab one man and said we'll do our own work let's just let us just take your name to take away our approach but he said how glorious will that little branch that escapes all these things that will be Holiness unto the Lord in that day when real genuine born-again women know their place though they be laughed at and called silly and old-fashioned and everything but act like a woman like a lady stand like a woman dress like a woman talk like a woman Live Like a Lady amen the flashing red light of his coming I'm going to have to get this here because my eyes aren't I'm getting old and said uh let's see but they were perverted until they it becomes so common that when we become so common that they lived with the men the natural perversion from the sex cells had changed its position because that women had become so cheap imagine what he's talking about in back in the 50s and 60s a few days ago I was over Tucson went to get a loaf of bread and there was a boy sitting out there and two little boys in the car another came in got a pack of cigarettes the old grade headed gentleman looked down said who is the cigarettes for your mother said no it's for that boy he said is he old enough to have them said yes sir you look back like that and I was standing with a loaf of bread and a quart of milk watching and he went and said all right and he give it to him he looked back at back to me and said I doubt that I said he can't get old enough to do it he ain't old enough at any age he said I'll agree with you said do you have a hard time trying to quit them I said I never did start them said I never did start him said my parents smoked and used tobacco but the Lord God kept me from it he turned and looked at me kind of strange he said well I think it's a rotten shame today to see of how said used to be we put a woman on a pedestal said we honored her we took off our head and her presence we walked down the streets and gentlemen would hear somebody make a remark about a certain woman they'd slap him down see said they honored women but he said sir women has brought it upon themselves said now they don't get up they used to get up in A Streetcar lady get up every man would take his hat off and let her sit down said now it's push crowd said they have brought it on themselves and that's the truth the devil hole of Hollywood Yonder produced it out of on the televisions and magazines till the thing has become a great big pot of Filth that's right all right so let's look at revelation 17. that's what it's become is just the the normal standard of the day what you see on your phone what you see in the media what you see are all around you we look at it and say oh this is just what it is it is propaganda and teaching from the devil treat it that way don't treat it like well this is just what it is because then you take it into your eyes you take it into your spirit and you think that's normal you're normal sisters that live this message that's normal that's right what's out there is a hell cesspot they say well we have freedom we can dress what you want that's not Freedom that's bondage to sin that's bondage to evil tell me today are you more honored treated more honorably you might be made fun of you might be called old-fashioned but when it comes down to it do they treat you with more honor than they do with the sex woman on the street you better believe they do why because it's the spirit that's on you when that spirit's on you you have under his protection under his safety and they might mistreat you they might speak against you but there's a level of honor that they'll never get around because that's how you're conducting yourself that's exactly what the prophet is that man was saying to brother Brandon is a woman stopped behaving herself with honor and respect she took the protection off that's what happened she took her protection off she cut out cut her hair put on pants put on makeup and what's the result that protection leaves now what's there man just treats a woman like a brute and looks at her like uh just a object of lust now that's his problem but it's the woman's problem too she's presented herself that way she needs to not do that and the man needs not to look like that look that way Revelation 17 1-3 and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me singing to become hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sitteth upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns we understand anytime in the Bible it speaks of a prostitute you're either looking at Israel who is committed idolatry against God as blasphemed God turned against God so God pictures her as an Unfaithful woman he does that in the Old Testament in the New Testament we see and you read in second Corinthians 11 that Paul's fear was that they would receive another word another gospel in another Jesus and he Likens on that unto he said I have engaged you to Christ as a Chase virgin but I'm afraid you'll receive another Jesus another Spirit another gospel thus committing adultery and becoming a that's exactly what had happened to the church not only that but it's gone so far as not only she's has she accepted the protection of politics but now she's in in this picture she's sitting upon politics and controlling politics and she's drunk she's drunk with the wine of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have also committed fornication with her and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color how anybody cannot see that this is the Roman Catholic Church they're completely blind what are the colors of the Roman Catholic Church purple and Scarlet and what what is she decked with every church and every altar is decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication just imagine she's got a golden cup with the blood of the martyrs in that cup and she's drinking it and she's drinking it with the kings of the earth that's how that's how far this woman has fallen and upon her head was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the Earth this woman by her own works and deeds has clothed herself right she's clothed herself in purple and Scarlet that's her own Deeds her own Works she has taken that upon herself and done that for herself now do you are you don't forget the scripture we LED with Isaiah chapter 4. she's clothed herself but there's another one they didn't clothe theirself and I heard as it were the works of a great multitude and as the voice of Benny Waters and the voice of Mighty thundering saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted so it was given to her it was a gift of Grace that she should be to raid in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints this is the righteousness of the Saints what is our righteousness not our own it's his righteousness and we're clothed in it so our husband gives us fine linen clean and white to be clothed in and that's the expression of our character right our character doesn't come from ourself our character comes from him living in us and that's the very thing that we're clothed with is what he grants to us so one woman she closes herself closes herself in purple and Scarlet she's decked with all kinds of gold and jewels and here we have the true wife of the Lamb she is granted she's given this garment and it's made of fine linen clean and white you see that what it says in Isaiah chapter 4 in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread what does it mean you're thinking of literal women this is denominations this is the Roman Catholic church we will eat our own bread what's bread The Word of Life the word we will eat our own bread we're gonna we're gonna create our own word we're going to take our own word and we're gonna we're gonna eat that word that's the word we don't want the word of Christ that's Vindicated for the the hour that we live in no we want our own bread we want to we're gonna we're gonna provide our bread for ourself and we're going to take what does it say we'll wear our own apparel right she refused the apparel that Christ was offering she refused the bread that Christ was offering notice what she says next only let us be called by Thy Name Church of Christ they want to be called by the name of Jesus Christ but they don't want his bread and they don't want his garments they want their own garments their own word their own righteousness and not that which Christ is offering to them but notice in that day there's a branch from the Lord and what is that Branch it's beautiful and glorious the fine linen is what the righteousness of saints right and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel so what is it speaking of there isn't there is a great hour of deception and there's going to be a people that escape there's going to be a people escape from that deception and what is it going to be the fruit of the earth well they're going to have really nice farms in their backyard right no what is it speaking of the fruit of her life the the kind of Life the character that she produces before will be calmly it'll be comely so in other words she she is she has the beauty the true beauty right what is true beauty brother Branham tells us in marriage and divorce that Christ was not featured in outward Beauty there's no beauty that we should desire him but what was it it was the beauty of character and what does he tell us in choosing of a bride when you're choosing your wife young men you don't go for outward Beauty you look for character that's what you're looking for that's what your should be Desiring so that's what Christ is going after that's what Christ is looking at who will receive my garments who will receive the bread that I have to offer you might say I want to be called by your name Christ you don't just get called by his name by your own efforts and your own desire if you take your own bread and your own clothes what is it it's filthy it's filthy in his sight he doesn't accept that and he's not going to place his name on someone who takes their own bread and their own garments he puts on one that we surrender everything that we have and that we could produce and take what he grants to us amen and that's what that that's what the message has been given to us in this day is to clothe Us in the word we're Washed by the washing of Water by the word so that our garments are without spot and wrinkle or any such thing husbands Ephesians 5 25-27 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that should be holy and without blemish so husbands are to love their wives that's what Christ does Christ provides for what we have need of that's what this whole thing is saying he will he he offers his very body his very life all that he is for the protection of and for the provision for his bride that he might present his bride to himself the way she's supposed to be presented it's him doing that work providing for her and her saying amen I receive what you have I I accept what you have Genesis 2 24. therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh so that's what he's that's what he's calling us to in this day is calling us to be one flesh Christ has descended from heaven with a message and what is that message to produce a bride that's in an invisible Union with him but what what does the church do say where where is he I don't see him anywhere where is the promise of his coming everything's the same since the fathers fell asleep see they don't they don't see it they don't recognize that he's come to cleave to his wife right and what's the response of the wife yes I submit I submit to what you have for me I honor you I respect you Genesis 3 16 under the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee so you see God in his original creation he made man and woman equal right he made them equal but he made them different didn't make them the same when we read I can't remember if it's the next scripture I have up yeah but I suffer not a woman to teach nor you serve authority over the man but to be in silence for Adam was first form then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so you notice that it isn't a result of the curse that man the husband is the head of the wife that's not the curse that's God's original design why why why do I say that is because when Paul is arguing that women shouldn't be a preacher and take authority over the church and over the man he's going back to the original creation he says Adam was first formed proving that Adam is to be the leader the preacher right he's he's to lead let me go back to this verse so it's not that but what it what is this speaking of he shall rule over thee you say well that was that's showing it was a change we were to be equal and he wasn't going to rule over here this word ruling is different than leading than headship it's not the same thing ruling here speaks of uh leading with rigor we would call it a dictatorship he shall have dictatorship over thee that is part of the curse right now the man is going to be dictator over the woman and we see that in in societies through history the woman is merely property her her voice is has no value uh she she is just there for producing babies that was the picture and she's you can just discard her anytime you want to she has no rights nothing that that was all of history but what is what does Christ come and do we'll we'll get into this probably in the next time I do Sunday school but what does Christ do in in a day when a woman couldn't even be a witness in a court of law as soon as a man rose up and said a word he it was done the woman's word was invalidated Christ rises from the dead and who's the first person that he meets a woman and guess what guess what the disciples did when the woman came and said oh I saw Christ she's emotional they they dismissed it they didn't believe it just like the rest of society but that didn't bother the Lord Jesus he was going to show them the value of the woman he had he even had following along him with him women that he wanted to listen to his message you say what's the big deal in that a lot a big huge deal because if you read Jewish literature of the time women didn't even need to know the law they need to knew the rules about kosher outside of that don't let her in the synagogue don't teach her anything just she should dress like this she should cook like this outside of that she needs to know nothing Christ is there and what is between Mary and Martha they're having a disagreement one of them is serving the other one is not serving serving is listening to the word Jesus said the one that's listening to the word is chosen the best thing right he's not validating what society and what everybody else was doing he's saying women need to sit and listen to the word as just as much as men need to sit and listen to the word see it's see you have to understand the gospel is coming to to restore the right relationships in families and in homes they didn't have it right they didn't have it right in the Old Testament most of society didn't have it right the gospel comes to make those things right but here we have again she's sorrow and conception is Multiplied and sorrow you shall bring forth children which of course is makes perfect sense since she ate an apple um no she committed adultery and so God was cursing the very thing that was used in that adultery and the process that was there uh produ from the that the adultery but her desire will be to your husband well why would he say that because her desire went away from her husband right and he shall rule over thee so the the relationship is this is the curse you say oh no this is just how the relationships are supposed to be is it not the curse it is the curse just as much as thorns and thistles are the curse for the man right um I I found this fascinating therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also so I think that's from the I'm I'm referring to that because in the New Testament it tell it encourages women to call their husbands Lord so sisters call your husband lord well we have we have a strange we have our society is very strange in that uh this is a different word so this is an Adonai that's the word we use for God in Hebrew this is adoni and so we think well man that's like really how how can I do that it literally would translate to sir if if you looked at it so it's it's it's and the reason why I realized this was I was in the airport in Tel Aviv and a man just walked right past me and was walking past everybody in the line and a woman yelled out at an e and I was like huh why is she calling him Lord so I looked at brother Colin who was with me and he said oh that's just like saying sir it's the same same thing in in English huh so in other words it's just simply saying speak to your husband with respect you don't have to call him Lord I'm not that's not what I'm saying it's telling you be respectful be be be be reverent even the Bible says to your husband uh uh we got like one minute left so I'm just gonna stop there and we'll pick up so let's stand it's amazing to me you begin to talk about this and it's incredible how the spirit of this
