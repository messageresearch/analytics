[2:23] Hallelujah.
[2:25] You got some joy tonight.
[2:27] Amen. If there is a person alive that
[2:31] should have joy, it's us, saints of God.
[2:34] Why? Because we know who we are. We know
[2:36] where we came from. We know where we're
[2:38] returning. Amen. The word has been given
[2:41] to us in its fullness. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:45] What more could we ask for? Amen. Why
[2:48] don't you greet one another?

[2:54] Hallelujah.
[2:56] God bless you, brother, sister.
[2:59] Amen.
[3:03] and try this world is falling apart. We
[3:06] sang it a little while back. We'll try
[3:08] it again tonight.
[3:11] Do you got the words for that, Sarah?
[3:19] While living below, everywhere that I
[3:23] go, this world's full of trouble and
[3:26] pain.
[3:28] There's murder and crime. This is the
[3:32] end time when people are going insane.
[3:37] But I found a release. My heart is at
[3:41] peace. Since the word of the hour
[3:44] settled in
[3:47] with troubles untold, my anchor will
[3:50] hold to Jesus again and again.
[3:55] Oh, this world is falling apart. I'm so
[4:00] glad Jesus lives down in my heart.
[4:04] I'm carried away in the light of today.
[4:08] As the world gets so dismal and dark
[4:13] by the struggles and troubles outside,
[4:17] something is stirring inside of the
[4:20] bride. Hallelujah. As the world gets so
[4:24] dark and it all falls apart, I'm glad
[4:27] Jesus lives down in my heart.
[4:31] They're praying for peace, for violence
[4:34] to cease while holding a gun in their
[4:38] hand.
[4:40] There's moral decay, a great falling
[4:43] away in the shape this world's in. It
[4:46] won't stand.
[4:49] Let it crumble and fall. I'm not
[4:51] bothered at all. In the clft of the rock
[4:55] I can hide.
[4:57] When it all comes undone. I'm trusting
[5:01] in one who gives me his peace down
[5:04] inside.
[5:06] Oh, this world is falling apart. I'm so
[5:10] glad Jesus lives down in my heart.
[5:15] I'm carried away in the light of today.
[5:19] As the world gets so dismal and dark,
[5:23] while the struggles and troubles
[5:26] outside, something is stirring inside of
[5:30] the bride.
[5:32] As the world gets so dark and it all
[5:35] falls apart, I'm glad Jesus lives. Give
[5:39] me that second verse again. They're
[5:41] praying for peace, for the violence to
[5:45] cease while holding a gun in their hand.
[5:50] There's more of decay. The great falling
[5:53] away in the shape this world's in. It
[5:56] won't stand.
[5:59] Let it crumble and fall. I'm not
[6:01] bothered at all. In the cliff of the
[6:04] rock, I can't hide.
[6:07] When it all comes undone, I'm trusting
[6:11] in one who gives me his peace down
[6:14] inside.
[6:16] Oh, this world is falling apart.
[6:20] Oh yes, Lord.
[6:24] [Music]
[6:25] [Applause]
[6:26] [Music]
[6:30] As the world gets so dismal and dark
[6:34] from the struggles and troubles outside,
[6:38] something is stirring inside of the
[6:41] bride.
[6:43] As the world gets so dark and it all
[6:46] falls apart, I'm glad Jesus lives down
[6:49] in my heart.
[6:53] Oh, hallelujah.
[6:55] Thank you, Lord.
[6:57] Amen.
[6:59] Something stirring inside of the bride.
[7:02] Amen. I can sense it here tonight. How
[7:04] about you? Hallelujah.
[7:07] Amen.
[7:08] [Music]
[7:10] Laying up, laying up my treasures in
[7:14] that home above.
[7:17] Trusting fully trusting in the Savior's
[7:20] love. Doing what I can for heaven's
[7:24] holy.
[7:27] I'm getting ready to leave this world.
[7:33] Getting ready to leave this world.
[7:38] Getting ready for the gates of pearl.
[7:43] Keeping my record bright. Watching both
[7:47] day and night. I'm getting ready to
[7:51] leave this world. Trusting in the riches
[7:56] of his saving grace.
[7:59] In each earthly trial I can trace.
[8:05] through that up in heaven. I will find a
[8:08] place. I'm getting ready to leave this
[8:14] world.
[8:16] Getting ready to leave this world.
[8:21] Getting ready for the gates of birth.
[8:26] Keeping my record right. Watching both
[8:30] day and night. I'm getting ready. I like
[8:34] this next verse.
[8:37] To prepare a mansion, Jesus said, "I'll
[8:41] go." If it were not true, I would have
[8:45] told you so.
[8:48] Just a little longer to linger here
[8:51] below. Hallelujah. I'm getting ready to
[8:56] leave this world. Getting ready to leave
[9:02] this world.
[9:04] Getting ready for the gates of pearls.
[9:09] Keeping my record bright. Watching both
[9:13] day and night. I'm getting ready to
[9:17] leave this world.
[9:21] [Music]
[9:24] Oh, hallelujah.
[9:26] [Applause]
[9:27] Amen. and brother Luther, if you'd come
[9:29] and take up the offering tonight. And
[9:32] Sister Emily, come on and prepare for
[9:35] your special.
[9:37] Hallelujah. Isn't God good, saints?
[9:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Come on.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Getting ready.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Each day I'm getting ready just a
[9:54] little bit more every day.
[9:56] Wouldn't it be something to wake up in
[9:58] the morning in a different place than
[10:00] here? Amen. The faith has to climb to
[10:04] that point that at any moment, at any
[10:07] time. So, we do want to make ready.
[10:10] Amen. And he is more than willing, you
[10:13] know, the prophet said he was more
[10:14] willing to give you the Holy Ghost than
[10:15] you were to receive it.
[10:18] So, it's just that step of accepting
[10:20] what he's done for you and believing it.
[10:23] He'll take care of the rest. Amen. Let's
[10:26] pray. Father, I love you this evening.
[10:28] Lord, I just thank you, Father, for the
[10:31] revelation of who you are, what you're
[10:34] doing in this day and time. Lord,
[10:37] if I didn't have that, Father, I would
[10:38] be above all men most miserable. Lord,
[10:41] seeing what's going on out there
[10:44] in the world cosmos. Father,
[10:47] the song said, people are just going
[10:49] insane.
[10:51] Father, we pray that you help us and we
[10:53] thank you for the right mind, a mind of
[10:56] peace, a mind of righteousness, the mind
[10:58] of Christ. I pray that you grant that to
[11:01] each and everyone here and those that
[11:03] would listen, Father.
[11:05] And Lord, as we gather together, we come
[11:07] to see you. We may not see you
[11:10] physically, Father, but may we sense
[11:13] with faith your presence amongst us,
[11:15] Lord. how much you want to talk to us.
[11:18] How much you want to comfort us. How
[11:21] much you want to release all the cares
[11:24] of this life.
[11:26] Father, we look to you this evening.
[11:28] Break the bread of life to our hearts.
[11:30] Bless the man that would come. Help him
[11:32] to move aside, Lord. Many times a
[11:36] minister will come and speak things he
[11:38] doesn't even know why.
[11:40] But your spirit is taking those words
[11:43] and anointing your children and helping
[11:45] each and every one as we collect the
[11:48] tithes and offerings. Lord, I pray that
[11:49] you would bless the cheerful giver.
[11:52] Father, we thank you so much for the
[11:54] bounty that you give us. Help us to be
[11:57] diligent,
[11:59] Lord, and to be
[12:02] remembering why you gave it to us. We
[12:05] love and worship you, Father, in Jesus
[12:07] name. Amen.
[12:10] [Music]
[12:14] Amen. Good. Sister Emily, you can be
[12:17] seated.
[12:20] [Music]
[12:29] I know you're going through the fire.
[12:36] It's getting hard to stand the heat.
[12:42] [Music]
[12:43] Even harder is the wonder.
[12:48] [Music]
[12:50] Is God's hand still on me?
[12:54] [Music]
[12:59] It's lonely in the flames and it seems
[13:03] you won't make it one more day.
[13:09] [Music]
[13:10] But the potter knows the clay.
[13:17] How much pressure it can take.
[13:22] [Music]
[13:23] How many times around the wheel
[13:29] till there's submission to his will.
[13:36] He's planned a beautiful design,
[13:40] [Music]
[13:43] but it'll take some fire and time.
[13:49] [Music]
[13:50] It's going to be okay
[13:57] cuz the potter knows the clay.
[14:03] [Music]
[14:09] Friend, I just came through that fire
[14:13] [Music]
[14:16] not too long ago.
[14:22] Looking back, I can see why
[14:26] [Music]
[14:29] that my God was in control.
[14:37] But on the hardest day I cry, "Oh Lord,
[14:42] isn't it about time?"
[14:49] But the potter knows the claim.
[14:55] How much pressure it can take,
[15:02] how many times around the wheel
[15:08] till their submission to his will.
[15:15] He's planned a beautiful design,
[15:21] but it'll take some fire and time.
[15:29] It's going to be okay.
[15:35] Cuz the potter knows the clay.
[15:41] He's planned a beautiful design,
[15:48] but it'll take some fire and
[15:55] it's going to be okay
[15:58] [Music]
[16:01] cuz the potter knows the clay.
[16:06] [Music]
[16:08] It's going to be okay. Cuz
[16:14] the potter knows the clay.
[16:25] Oh, hallelujah. So grateful for that
[16:28] tonight.
[16:30] Let's all stand. You ready for the word
[16:32] tonight?
[16:34] Amen. And well, if you're the clay
[16:37] like that song said, then tonight I want
[16:39] you to just raise your hands and enter
[16:42] into this next song with me. Sing it
[16:44] like a prayer.

[22:03] the end. Amen. I'm looking forward to

[24:10] Tron G.
[24:14] Well, I thought that I had died
[24:20] and gone to heaven.
[24:25] Lord, I thought
[24:28] I stood outside the eastern gate
[24:37] and a man from within
[24:42] said, "Have you been born again?
[24:47] Is your name
[24:50] written in the book of life?
[24:55] [Music]
[24:57] Please search the book again.
[25:02] [Music]
[25:03] I thought my name was there.
[25:09] I went to church
[25:11] on Sunday,
[25:14] though I never
[25:17] knelt in prayer. Please search the book
[25:21] again.
[25:24] It's too late now, I know.
[25:29] Please search the book again
[25:33] [Music]
[25:34] before you make
[25:37] me go.
[25:40] [Music]
[25:43] Well, I told him
[25:46] all the good deeds
[25:48] I had done.
[25:52] [Music]
[25:53] Lord, I showed him
[25:56] all the trophies I had won.
[26:03] Oh, but then he said to me,
[26:08] "Son, have you been set free?
[26:14] Is your name written in the book of
[26:19] life?
[26:22] Oh, please search the book again."
[26:27] [Music]
[26:29] I thought my name was there.
[26:34] I went to church on
[26:38] Sunday,
[26:40] though I never
[26:42] held in prayer. Please search the book
[26:47] again.
[26:49] It's too late now. I know.
[26:54] They search the book again
[26:58] [Music]
[26:59] before you make
[27:02] me go.
[27:08] And then he turned and left me
[27:13] standing there.
[27:19] Oh, I knew
[27:21] it was too late now for prayer.
[27:29] And so, my sinner friend,
[27:34] if you will
[27:37] in
[27:39] your name must be in that book of life.
[27:47] Oh, please search the book again.
[27:53] I thought my name was there.
[27:59] I went to church
[28:01] on Sunday,
[28:04] though I never
[28:07] knelt in prayer. Please search the book
[28:11] again.
[28:14] It's too late now. I know.
[28:19] Please search the book again
[28:23] [Music]
[28:24] before you make
[28:27] me go.
[28:33] Amen.
[28:35] [Applause]
[28:40] I tell you, I sure don't want no
[28:42] disappointments there. Do you?
[28:45] Sadly, we know that it's got to be.
[28:47] There's going to be many on that day
[28:49] will say, "Lord, Lord, look at what all
[28:52] I did. Look at all the good things I've
[28:54] done. All the good deeds I've done it."
[28:58] Amen. Well, if you have your Bibles,
[29:00] we'll uh if you would stand with me and
[29:02] we'll read.
[29:05] We'll read in the book of Psalms 139.
[29:10] Certainly good to be here tonight. I I
[29:12] told brother Matt it's been a long time
[29:15] since I've seen him three whole days
[29:18] where he come up there to brother
[29:21] Yansies and we were able to go and be in
[29:23] service with them and just had a
[29:25] wonderful time and uh so I wanted to

[29:35] we'll start at verse 17.
[29:43] How precious are also are thy thoughts
[29:45] unto me, oh God. How great is the sum of
[29:49] them. If I should count them, they are
[29:52] more in number than the sand. When I
[29:55] awake, I am still with thee.
[29:58] Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, oh
[30:00] God. Depart from me, therefore, ye
[30:02] bloody men, for they speak against thee
[30:05] wickedly, and thine enemies take thy
[30:08] name in vain.
[30:10] Do not I hate them, oh Lord, that hate
[30:12] thee, and am not I grieved with those
[30:16] that rise up against thee? I hate them
[30:18] with perfect hatred. I count them mine
[30:21] enemies.
[30:23] Well, I tell you what, he had a lot of
[30:25] enemies, didn't he? A lot of hatred
[30:27] going on. Maybe we'll look at it just a
[30:30] little bit differently when the service
[30:32] is over. Search me, oh God, and know my
[30:35] heart. Try me and know my thoughts. And
[30:39] see if there be any wicked way in me,
[30:42] &gt;&gt; and lead me in the way of everlasting.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to look at verse 17.
[30:51] Let's read that one. How precious also
[30:53] are thy thoughts unto me, oh God. How
[30:56] great is the sum of them. In verse 23 it
[30:59] says, "Search me, oh God, and know my
[31:01] heart. Try me and know my thoughts."
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, as
[31:08] we come to you tonight, so thankful for
[31:11] another opportunity, privileged, Lord,
[31:14] to be gathered in the house of God with
[31:17] the precious purchased Lord of your
[31:19] blood. standing here, Lord, we feel so
[31:22] inadequate, but Father, we just come and
[31:25] do all that we can, Lord, for your
[31:27] kingdom. May it be a blessing, oh
[31:29] Father, for somebody. We pray, dear
[31:31] Father, most of all that your Holy
[31:33] Spirit would be here with us, Lord, and
[31:35] take our words, Lord, and put it
[31:37] together in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[31:40] You can be seated.
[31:43] So, I wanted to uh start off tonight.
[31:46] Um, I've got I preached this last Sunday
[31:49] morning. So, I know we have some folks
[31:50] listening in and you're going to get a
[31:53] another taste of what we had Sunday
[31:55] morning, but I just felt led to to speak
[31:58] on this. I was um as I started on this
[32:01] subject, it um I think it affects just
[32:06] about all of us. Uh especially in this
[32:08] age that we're living in. Um we we are
[32:12] definitely in a time Thank you, brother.
[32:15] We're definitely in a time of of image
[32:19] obsessed people.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; The name of this uh sermon is narcissism
[32:26] and the very nature of Satan.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Narcissism, the very nature of Satan.
[32:32] Now, we hear that word a lot and I've
[32:33] heard it growing up coming up and and I
[32:35] always just thought it was somebody that
[32:36] was full of yourself or Thank you,
[32:38] brother. somebody that was just arrogant
[32:41] or maybe they had been spoiled and you
[32:43] know like the rich kid or whatever and
[32:45] and and so we we've all heard of that
[32:47] where he's a he's a self-centered guy.
[32:49] He's he's just full of himself or you
[32:51] know kind of like that but I never
[32:53] really knew what exactly narcissism was
[32:56] and I got to looking into it and and the
[32:58] word it comes from Greek mythology and
[33:02] I'm not going to get into fairy tales
[33:04] but that's where the word comes from.
[33:06] There was supposedly someone named
[33:07] narcissist and and he was in in uh he
[33:10] was cursed to fall in love with himself
[33:12] and he he sat and looked at himself in a
[33:15] pool until he died or something like
[33:17] that or anyway something to that to that
[33:19] degree. Um and and and so that's where
[33:22] they get the word narcissism from as the
[33:25] term of somebody who's just in love with
[33:27] themselves, in love with their own image
[33:29] and so focused on their own image. And
[33:33] um but you know, they actually call it a
[33:35] disorder.
[33:37] They say it's a narcissism uh
[33:39] personality disorder. Uh and and you can
[33:42] put labels on all kinds of things. They
[33:45] call psychopaths, they call uh
[33:47] sociopaths, they've got all kinds of
[33:49] different things. In psychology, I'd
[33:51] like for one psychologist to come up
[33:53] here and tell me they've ever cured
[33:54] anybody.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; They actually ask them on the street.
[33:57] They'll go out there and say, "Hey,
[33:58] you're a psychologist?" "Yeah." "How
[34:00] many people have you cured?" crickets.
[34:02] So, all you hear is crickets. They can't
[34:04] cure anybody. They might can mitigate
[34:06] the the effects of whatever they're
[34:08] going through with drugs or some kind of
[34:11] therapy or something like that. But when
[34:12] it comes down to it, what what they
[34:15] won't admit and they don't even realize
[34:16] it, they don't know it is that what they
[34:18] have diagnosed and it is the premier
[34:20] diagnosis of this day um is, you know,
[34:24] along with depression and loneliness is
[34:26] narcissism.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; And and so um with that being said, it's
[34:31] it's being diagnosed as a psychological
[34:34] disorder, but we know what it really is.
[34:36] It's absolutely a demon possession.
[34:39] It's absolutely. And they'll never admit
[34:40] that because they can't. They don't
[34:42] believe in demons. They don't believe in
[34:43] God or anything else. But we as the
[34:45] church of God realize and recognize what
[34:48] these things are. Now, I'm not up here
[34:51] to to uh enlighten you to the um to the
[34:56] the the the symptoms or the
[34:58] characteristics so that you can go
[35:00] around labeling somebody. Well, you're a
[35:02] narcissist, you're this, you're that.
[35:05] But it's so that we can because I don't
[35:07] have that. I'm not qualified to do that.
[35:09] But we can certainly look at at all of
[35:12] these characteristics and know that
[35:14] every single one of us has some of them
[35:17] from time to time.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; We're all born in sin, shaped in
[35:21] iniquity, come in the world speaking
[35:23] lies. Even as a little baby, as cute as
[35:24] they are, they're all about them.
[35:26] They're all about me. And if you don't
[35:28] give it to them, they're going to let
[35:29] you know. They're going to squall.
[35:31] They're going to cry. They're going to
[35:32] pitch a fit and do everything else
[35:33] because it's about them. Now, we know
[35:36] that's the nature that we're born into.
[35:38] Now, so I do believe it's a spirit and
[35:42] and and
[35:43] one thing that tells you that it's a
[35:45] spirit is because somebody with this
[35:48] personality or who lends themselves or
[35:50] has a tendency to this personality, it
[35:52] will always lead you in the opposite way
[35:55] that God wants you to go.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; All right? So, that is evidence right
[36:00] there. It's certainly of the devil. And
[36:02] we've all come in contact with somebody
[36:05] who has this uh characteristic. Um maybe
[36:08] you work with them, maybe you go to
[36:10] church with them, maybe you've sat under
[36:11] them as a pastor, maybe you've uh uh
[36:14] cult leaders are rife with it. There's a
[36:17] basically that's the that's the recipe
[36:19] to be a cult leader. You must be a
[36:21] narcissist. Amen. So most of them are
[36:24] that way. Um now we all we work with
[36:27] them. You might even have somebody in
[36:28] your family. Maybe you're married to
[36:30] one. Maybe you are one. You don't even
[36:31] realize it. Uh so here we go. Some of
[36:34] the characteristics are self-centered.
[36:37] This is what I got straight from
[36:38] Wikipedia. So y'all take it up with
[36:40] them.
[36:42] So self-centered, thinking only of
[36:44] themselves, ignoring others needs. Sense
[36:47] of entitlement.
[36:49] They they feel they're always right or
[36:51] better than other people and deserve
[36:53] more. Lack of empathy. Don't care about
[36:56] others feelings unless acting like they
[36:58] do will make them look better.
[37:02] manipulative or controlling. Use
[37:05] emotions to manipulate and are extremely
[37:08] jealous in relationships.
[37:11] A strong need of admiration and
[37:13] affirmation. They have to be the center
[37:15] of attention. Can't take negative
[37:17] feedback or criticism. Won't admit when
[37:20] they're wrong. They're easily wounded
[37:22] and often feel wronged by others. Quick
[37:26] to feel hurt or angry. Yeah,
[37:29] &gt;&gt; always the victim, always playing the
[37:31] victim, and it's always uh somebody
[37:33] else's fault. Uh and and and and here's
[37:36] the thing about it. If you ever come in
[37:38] contact with one, and you ever get an
[37:41] apology out of one, be looking for a
[37:44] unicorn somewhere or the Easter Bunny,
[37:46] because it it's not going to be a
[37:49] genuine apology. If it's an apology,
[37:51] it's a it's for a uh it's for a reason.
[37:54] like that would come up and I'd say,
[37:56] "Brother Steve, I I'm sorry I said what
[37:59] I did. I'm sorry I did that. Now wait
[38:01] for it. Three, two, one. But
[38:06] &gt;&gt; if you hadn't have done what you did, I
[38:09] wouldn't have said what I said." So, a
[38:11] lot of times these these apologies are
[38:13] are are just veiled attempts to actually
[38:15] get you told what they really want to
[38:17] do. They want to open up a dialogue.
[38:19] They want to open up this conversation
[38:21] with you because they're going to get
[38:22] the last word.
[38:24] always going to get the last word and
[38:26] and and and and so that that has always
[38:29] been uh one of the ways that they can
[38:30] get in and they'll never Oh my well here
[38:34] here we go. So the first instance in the
[38:37] Bible that we can uh read about uh was
[38:42] in Genesis chapter 4.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Genesis chapter 4
[38:47] and we'll look at what true narcissism
[38:51] really looks like.
[38:54] Narcissism manifested in the earth for
[38:57] the first time.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Adam uh I'm sorry uh chapter 4, Genesis
[39:03] chapter 4. And Adam knew Eve as wife and
[39:06] she conceived of bear Cain and said, "I
[39:08] have gotten a man from the Lord. All
[39:10] life comes from God." Is that right?
[39:13] &gt;&gt; But he was not of God.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; And she again bare his brother Abel. And
[39:18] Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was
[39:20] a tiller of the ground. And in process
[39:23] of time it came to pass that Cain
[39:25] brought of the fruit of the ground an
[39:27] offering unto the Lord. And Abel he also
[39:30] brought of the firstlings of his flock
[39:32] and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had
[39:34] respect unto Abel and to his offering.
[39:36] But unto Cain and to his offering he had
[39:39] not respect. And Cain was very wroth and
[39:41] his countenance fell. Now what does that
[39:44] mean? Now, in today's vernacular, in
[39:46] today's English that we would use, he's
[39:48] like, he got a really bad attitude. He
[39:53] He went from smiling, he went from
[39:55] expecting some great thing, he went
[39:57] from, "I'm going to get this reward to
[40:00] no, you're not."
[40:03] &gt;&gt; And he went from jolly to not jolly. He
[40:05] went from his eyes, he lost a smile, and
[40:08] then his eyes narrowed in wrath and
[40:11] anger. His jaw set, his teeth gritted.
[40:14] That's his countenance fell.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Cain, "Why art
[40:18] thou wroth? And why is thy countenance
[40:22] fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou
[40:25] not be accepted?" Wow. Mercy extended
[40:28] even unto this
[40:30] &gt;&gt; fellow mercy. If you do the right thing,
[40:33] &gt;&gt; you'll be accepted, too.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; And if thou doest not well, sin lith at
[40:37] the door. And unto thee shall be his
[40:39] desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
[40:43] And Cain talked with Abel, his brother,
[40:47] jealous,
[40:49] upset,
[40:50] &gt;&gt; mad because his sacrifice wasn't
[40:53] accepted.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Why are you so great?
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:58] And Abel, I'm sure he said, 'Well, don't
[41:00] you remember what mom and dad told us
[41:02] about the sin that happened and that
[41:04] after it it it it took place that God
[41:07] himself took a lamb and killed the lamb
[41:10] and clothed mom and dad and and the
[41:12] blood was running down their legs when
[41:13] they left the garden. And and I just
[41:16] believe that it that it had to be blood
[41:18] that it was blood that caused the sin
[41:19] and and it had to be blood that covered
[41:21] the sin.
[41:23] Cain didn't want to hear that. And all
[41:25] he could hear was the blood rushing in
[41:28] his ears because of his anger
[41:29] &gt;&gt; because he had been rejected.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass when they were in
[41:38] the field that Cain rose up against
[41:40] Abel, his brother, and slew him.
[41:45] Now, I want you to look at at the
[41:46] characteristics of this man that with
[41:49] his jealousy and with his anger and and
[41:52] and not being able to to recognize that
[41:56] he was wrong that when God came to him,
[42:01] I'm Elohim, almighty God, Elshadai,
[42:06] Jehovah, Gyra came down and talked to
[42:09] Cain
[42:10] &gt;&gt; and said, "Where is your brother? And he
[42:14] stands there flatfooted and lies right
[42:17] to God's face and says, "I know not."
[42:24] And then he even sasses God and says,
[42:27] "What? Am I his babysitter?"
[42:29] &gt;&gt; See, no accountability.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Never ex never admitting when you're
[42:35] wrong.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; The very nature of Satan.
[42:40] No accountability at all. and lying
[42:43] right to God's face.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; I looked it up. It said if you ever miss
[42:48] a narcissist from your life, just
[42:51] remember all the things that they would
[42:53] do. Gaslight.
[42:56] They that that means they they turn
[42:58] something twisted around that they
[42:59] actually did and make it sound like you
[43:00] did it.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever had that happen to you
[43:04] before? I didn't say that. You said
[43:06] that. What? I didn't. And then they make
[43:09] you think you're the crazy one. Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; And lying is right there with it.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; It says if you ever miss them, just
[43:19] remember all the good qualities lying
[43:22] and lying and lying
[43:26] &gt;&gt; because they'll all that they don't want
[43:28] to be held accountable for what they do.
[43:30] But they'll always deflect.
[43:34] If it if if something comes their way,
[43:36] they will deflect it every time and
[43:38] never e never accept it or never admit
[43:42] to wrongdoing unless it makes them look
[43:44] better.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; If it makes them look good and say, you
[43:49] know what, I really don't feel like I
[43:51] did anything wrong. But if it gets me
[43:53] where I want to go, if it gets me a
[43:54] little farther up the road, if it if it
[43:56] helps my image, if it makes me look a
[43:58] little bit better, I'll say I'm sorry.
[44:01] I'll say, you know what? I was wrong. I
[44:02] shouldn't have done that.
[44:04] See,
[44:06] that's kind of
[44:08] where they go. But now look, look at
[44:10] what happened. So when God tells him,
[44:13] "What hast thou done?" In verse 10, what
[44:15] has thou done? The voice of thy
[44:16] brother's blood crith unto me from the
[44:19] ground. And now art thou cursed from the
[44:22] earth, which hast opened her mouth to
[44:24] receive thy brother's blood from thy
[44:26] hand. When thou tillest the ground, it
[44:28] shall not henceforth yield unto her
[44:30] strength. a fugitive and a vagabond
[44:33] shalt thou be in the earth. Oh boy, he
[44:36] took away the very thing that he trusted
[44:38] so much in was the the labor of his
[44:40] hands, the work of his hands, the fruit
[44:43] that he could bring, the produce that he
[44:45] could bring. And God took that away from
[44:47] him. And what did Cain say? I'm so
[44:49] sorry. I should have never killed Abel.
[44:52] I'm sorry, God, that I lied to you. I'm
[44:54] sorry, God. I I if I would have just
[44:56] done what you told me to do, if I would
[44:58] have just done and and and and went back
[45:02] and realized and recognized that it's
[45:04] not the work of my hands that brings
[45:06] salvation, that it's not something I can
[45:09] do or or work my way into heaven, but it
[45:11] has to be a sacrifice. It has to be a
[45:14] blood sacrifice to pay that debt. Yes.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; But not one ounce of regret,
[45:22] &gt;&gt; not one apology, no remorse at all.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; And it's like what brother Matt said the
[45:29] other night at brother Yansy's. He said,
[45:31] "Many people, they're they're sick of
[45:34] what sin has done in their life,
[45:36] &gt;&gt; but they're not sick of the sin itself.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; They're just sad and and upset about,
[45:42] well, my life is in ruins. My life is
[45:43] attached. My wife is leaving me. my my
[45:45] boyfriend left whatever. You're you're
[45:47] upset at what the sin has caused but not
[45:50] at the sin itself.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That we could ever hate sin. That
[45:58] we could ever hate that thing.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Hate what God hates and love what God
[46:02] loves. Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; But I want you to look at what Cain said
[46:07] back to God. It wasn't remorse. It was
[46:09] remorse for himself. He was having a
[46:11] pity party.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, look at me.
[46:14] I look at what you look what's going to
[46:17] happen to me. I I This is what he said.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to condense it down to
[46:23] what really matters to to Cain.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; My I me I I me.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Let's say it again. My I me I I me.
[46:35] Let's say it like that. And I'm going to
[46:37] read it to you. Like Cain was squalling
[46:39] to God when he got kicked out of the
[46:41] garden or got kicked out of not the
[46:43] garden but in the area that that they
[46:44] were in. And Cain said unto the Lord,
[46:49] I'm going to say it with sniffles. My
[46:51] punishment is greater than I can bear.
[46:53] No thought of what happened to Abel
[46:56] &gt;&gt; laying over there with his brains bashed
[46:57] in.
[46:59] Behold, thou hast driven me out this day
[47:01] from the face of the earth, and from thy
[47:04] face shall I be hid, and I shall be a
[47:06] fugitive and a vagabond in the earth.
[47:09] And it shall come to pass that everyone
[47:11] that findeth me shall slay me, me, me,
[47:15] I, my, me.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; That spirit is an absolute spirit of
[47:22] Satan is what that is. When it's all
[47:24] about you and what you can get,
[47:27] &gt;&gt; that'll destroy your family.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; It'll destroy your friendships.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; You can't have a relationship with
[47:34] anybody. Yes, we can forgive people. We
[47:36] can when they do us wrong, but to have
[47:39] still have a relationship with them.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Relationship has to be built on trust.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; It has to be built on honesty.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; It has to be built on forgiveness. It
[47:48] has to be built on accountability. And
[47:50] it's not a one-way street.
[47:54] Yes, we are to forgive each other.
[47:56] Absolutely. Don't hold anything against
[47:58] you. But I'm not going to stick my hand
[48:00] in a hornet nest again if I've already
[48:02] done it one time.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; If you stick your hand in a hornet nest
[48:07] and get stung and do it again, well,
[48:10] that's on you.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; And that's some of the relationships
[48:12] that we get back into.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Thinking that things have changed,
[48:16] thinking that that things are going to
[48:17] be different. It it ain't going to be
[48:19] different just because they come to you
[48:20] with a sad story until you see the
[48:22] fruits of the change.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; And the only way that's going to happen
[48:28] is with an absolute deliverance from
[48:30] God.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; I mean a I mean a deliverance from God.
[48:35] It has to come that way. And you're
[48:37] saying, "Boy, you're talking to me
[48:38] tonight." Well, praise God. I hope I'm
[48:40] talking to somebody. That's
[48:42] &gt;&gt; cuz if if if you can see yourself in any
[48:44] of this, I I implore you to repent. If
[48:47] there's anything in your life that you
[48:50] are self-centered, that is all about me.
[48:52] It's what I can get. You know what I was
[48:54] listening to this man one time and he
[48:56] was saying? He said, "I want somebody to
[48:58] give me the definition of greed." He
[49:00] said, "There's nothing wrong with making
[49:02] more money. There's nothing wrong with
[49:03] earning this. It's what we all should
[49:05] do." And he was on the radio. And I came
[49:07] up with this little poem and I said, "I
[49:09] tell you what the definition of greed
[49:11] is." I never told him this. I should
[49:12] have sent it to him. But the definition
[49:13] of greed is when your desire to acquire
[49:17] exceeds your need. Now, that's okay. You
[49:20] can have a little bit more than what you
[49:21] need. More than baloney sandwiches. I
[49:23] like to have some shrimp and grits every
[49:24] now and then and a nice home and have
[49:26] have your guests over. But if if your
[49:29] desire to acquire exceeds your need, uh
[49:32] here's the caveat. To the detriment of
[49:34] others
[49:36] &gt;&gt; and the thoughtlessness of others,
[49:38] &gt;&gt; then that indeed is greed. See, that is
[49:42] greed. But because if you're just
[49:44] thinking about me and not thinking of
[49:46] your brother, not thinking of your
[49:48] sister, not thinking about somebody
[49:49] else, then that's a spirit of Cain. I'm
[49:52] sorry.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Now,
[49:54] here we go to Isaiah 14. Can we turn
[49:56] there?
[49:57] &gt;&gt; And I want you to see what Cain's daddy
[49:59] said.
[50:01] He didn't fall far from the tree. Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 14
[50:08] 13.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Let's just start with 12 so you kind of
[50:14] get this set the stage here. How art
[50:17] thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer,
[50:21] son of the morning? How art thou cut
[50:24] down to the ground which d weaken the
[50:27] nations?
[50:29] For thou hast said in thine heart, I
[50:32] will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[50:35] throne above the stars of God. I will
[50:38] sit upon also upon the mount of the
[50:41] congregation in the sides of the north.
[50:43] I will ascend above the heights of the
[50:45] clouds. I will be like the most high.
[50:50] I'm going to condense that for you. I I
[50:53] my I I I.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Sounds familiar, don't it?
[50:58] A my I or I guess y'all say around here.
[51:02] I
[51:06] I I I my
[51:11] I'm sorry.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Do y'all need an interpreter? I'm sure
[51:14] we could find one somewhere.
[51:19] Now, Satan has always aspired to this
[51:21] greatness as we see here.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; But you know, Brother Bam, he said he
[51:24] made a statement. He said that the devil
[51:26] is pretty near harmless unless he's got
[51:29] somebody to work through.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; I refuse to be that person.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that when they were going
[51:38] to build the tower of Babel and reach
[51:40] under heaven, didn't he want to get up
[51:41] there? I will exalt myself above the
[51:44] stone. So, that was the devil inspiring
[51:46] them and and and they started in the
[51:48] plane of Shinar. We're going to go all
[51:50] the way up. Boy, they had an aspiration.
[51:53] But you know, God of course stopped put
[51:55] a stop to all that. And and and so Satan
[51:59] has always
[52:01] used man
[52:03] now because men are little creators. God
[52:06] has created man in his image to be a
[52:09] creator to and we create beautiful
[52:11] things in the earth. Now we can't create
[52:12] life. Only God can do that. But I mean
[52:14] there's artwork and there's music and
[52:16] there's there's glorious uh sculptures
[52:19] and architecture, brother Steve, and all
[52:21] kinds of things that that that that is
[52:24] in the world and and so man are little
[52:26] creators, little gods.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; And so Satan to get in that avenue has
[52:30] always tried to find and weasle his ma
[52:33] way in to the human race. And he did it
[52:35] in the Garden of Eden, of course, and
[52:37] he's been doing it ever since. now is
[52:38] going to culminate, we know, with that
[52:40] man of sin who will be revealed one day
[52:43] after the bride is gone. But he will be
[52:45] revealed and that will be Satan's
[52:47] Superman. It'll be Satan living in a
[52:50] human being. Is that right?
[52:51] &gt;&gt; He'll be standing in human flesh.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; It'll be Satan incarnated.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Now, uh, and this man, he's going to be
[52:58] smart. He's going to be cunning. He's
[53:01] going to be diabolical. And he'll have
[53:03] an olive leaf in one hand while holding
[53:05] a dagger behind his back in the other.
[53:07] That's exactly what Satan Superman will
[53:09] be doing. Amen. And it's just it's just
[53:11] like his father, the devil. Now, we know
[53:14] that this age that that we're in is is
[53:18] absolute perfect bedding ground for this
[53:21] spirit because little by little with the
[53:24] with the fashion and the and the and I
[53:26] just heard an article the other day
[53:28] about how fashion magazines have have uh
[53:31] really uh really set the stage and and
[53:34] uh and they were the fashion and the
[53:36] models became more popular than rock
[53:38] stars. Some of them did. and and and so
[53:40] it it became a a self-absorbed
[53:43] generation. It it's self-absorbed. It's
[53:46] a it's image obsessed. Everybody's
[53:49] obsessed with their image. And and if
[53:51] you don't think that's a Jezebel spirit,
[53:53] just look at what Jezebel did when Joo
[53:55] came to see her. He thought she thought
[53:56] I can use my image and I can use my
[53:59] charm and my ws and I'll get out of
[54:01] this. But it didn't work. Amen. Now,
[54:03] this image of obsessed uh uh age that we
[54:07] live in, uh you can't get on Facebook or
[54:10] any of them is doing this right here and
[54:12] they got the phone and they're making
[54:14] the faces and they're doing the pouty
[54:15] lips and and uh that's the girls, not
[54:18] the guys. You better not be doing that
[54:20] stuff. And and the guys are they're like
[54:22] flexing and trying to wear the tight
[54:24] shirts and show the muscles off and and
[54:26] they want to get in the mirror and all
[54:28] that. It's absolutely image obsessed and
[54:31] you've got to be a 10 out of a 10. And
[54:33] if you ain't a 10 out of a 10, then you
[54:35] use Photoshop or you use whatever some
[54:37] kind of a little filter on there and and
[54:39] you and you poke it out here more and
[54:41] you bring it in here more and you do
[54:42] whatever you've got to do and and and so
[54:44] that's image obsessed. Watch that thing.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Watch that thing in your life. Don't get
[54:49] caught up with that.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; The devil can use that in your life. He
[54:54] certainly can because then it's all
[54:55] about how I look and I just got to look
[54:58] a certain way.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Now, this other thing that people do,
[55:04] this uh this this uh characteristic is
[55:08] they resist authority. They they don't
[55:10] want they don't want accountability.
[55:11] They sure don't want authority over
[55:13] telling them anything. Nobody's going to
[55:15] tell me. I heard this the other day that
[55:17] a pastor I had no way I'd call his name,
[55:18] but he said, "Ain't nobody going to
[55:21] correct me but God.
[55:24] Whoa.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Run, run, Rudolph. Right. You better be
[55:32] running.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to correct me but God. Oh
[55:37] my. If I ever get that way, brother.
[55:40] No accountability.
[55:42] Lie to be to avoid being seen in a bad
[55:45] light. Now, Proverbs 14:12. You can
[55:49] click on that if you want to. This is a
[55:51] very this is a very uh familiar
[55:54] scripture. Most of us can quote it. But
[55:57] it says that there is a way which seems
[56:00] right to a man,
[56:01] &gt;&gt; but the end thereof are the ways of
[56:04] death.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; And and and so it says in verse 16, "A
[56:09] wise man fearthth and departeth from
[56:11] evil, but the fool rageth and is
[56:14] confident." Right? Now,
[56:19] we we've been keeping up with this
[56:20] little thing that's been going on and
[56:22] and uh and so many of you have heard of
[56:24] Chip and Joanna Gains and they've got
[56:26] this whole network now. They started off
[56:28] taking houses and flipping them and and
[56:30] they would go in and take an old house
[56:32] and refurb it and and then fix it up and
[56:35] resell it and and so it became so
[56:36] popular the show did that she had her
[56:38] own line of products. Now they got their
[56:40] own network and and so they they decided
[56:44] they were going to have a show uh uh
[56:46] showcasing homesteaders and and so they
[56:50] picked a certain uh group of people that
[56:53] they decided I don't know how hard they
[56:55] had to look for them but they picked two
[56:57] gay men homesteaders. I've never heard
[56:59] those two those words in a sentence in
[57:01] my life. two gay men homesteaders and
[57:04] and I don't know how far they had to
[57:06] look to find them, but they found them.
[57:08] And and so they they showcased these
[57:11] people with children. They had went out
[57:13] and adopted them. I ain't no other way
[57:14] to get them for them. So they went out
[57:16] and adopted them. And and so now they've
[57:18] got this whole show with these guys and
[57:20] they're showing them getting out of bed,
[57:22] showing them getting into bed and all
[57:23] kinds of things. And these this uh man
[57:26] and woman Chip and Joanna have they have
[57:28] built their um their uh empire I would
[57:32] say really primarily on conservative
[57:34] people uh women homemakers that that
[57:37] have that have stayed home and and have
[57:39] tried to do and fix up their homes and
[57:40] and you know and so they really kind of
[57:44] have created a little firestorm of
[57:46] following them and people are like you
[57:48] know cancel culture cancel culture it's
[57:51] kind of funny they was hollering oh we
[57:53] hate cancel culture went the other way,
[57:55] but now they don't mind it when it's
[57:56] coming against them. But anyway, so now
[57:59] it's camp, we we got a camp, we got to
[58:00] do it with boycott, blah blah blah. So
[58:02] anyway, all that, but he so they asked
[58:06] the boy the the man, I'm sorry, Chip, um
[58:10] what uh what he thought about it. So
[58:13] instead of backing up and say, you know
[58:15] what, maybe we were a little
[58:16] unthoughtful. Maybe we hurt some people.
[58:18] Maybe we shouldn't have done that or
[58:19] what. No, they doubled down on it. They
[58:22] they didn't they didn't uh get the the
[58:24] memo from Bud Light about doubling down
[58:26] on the stupid idea, but they didn't but
[58:28] they doubled down on it and and and and
[58:31] and so they doubled down on it and he
[58:33] says, "Well, uh judge not lest you be
[58:36] judged." Oh boy, that'll shut him up,
[58:38] won't it? Not really. So then then he
[58:41] says, "Um, well, you know what? I don't
[58:44] ever even pick up I never feel really uh
[58:46] I don't feel like I need to read the
[58:48] Bible." Oh, big shocker there.
[58:52] And then he says, um, you know how I
[58:54] find God? I find God when I'm out
[58:56] working and sweating.
[58:59] Well, you know, let's just stop there
[59:02] for just a minute. You know, Brother
[59:04] Brandham said that's how he sees God
[59:07] when he's out in the wilderness and and
[59:09] the first time he ever saw God was in in
[59:11] nature and things like that. But
[59:14] &gt;&gt; but he didn't he didn't say and that's
[59:16] all you have to do is to know God is
[59:18] just go out in nature and things like
[59:20] that. I believe that you can see God.
[59:22] But you got to understand
[59:24] how they're trying to slant this.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; It's a way that seems right. I don't
[59:29] have to have your version of
[59:31] Christianity is what they're saying. I
[59:33] don't need a Bible written by a bunch of
[59:35] Jews 2,000 years ago to know God. That's
[59:38] what he's saying. I find God in my way.
[59:41] I find him the way that it makes me feel
[59:43] good. It makes me I get out there and I
[59:45] can do it this way and and and you know
[59:47] what? Well, it might give you some peace
[59:49] and it might give you some a little bit
[59:50] of solitude. I don't doubt that at all.
[59:53] Certainly it does. But to say that's all
[59:55] you have to do to find God, I absolutely
[59:58] will argue with him up one side and down
[1:00:00] another because there's a way that seems
[1:00:02] right to a man.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; The end there of his death as we saw in
[1:00:07] Cain. He thought that the way to God was
[1:00:10] sweating and working too, didn't he?
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; All I got to do is get out there and
[1:00:14] sweat and work and get these pretty
[1:00:15] flowers and get all this big produce and
[1:00:17] 40 pound watermelons and oh, God's going
[1:00:20] to receive my sacrifice. He's going to
[1:00:22] think this is beautiful. And you know
[1:00:24] what? Not a word.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; That pillar fire just moved right over
[1:00:29] there to Abel's sacrifice.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much work you do. When
[1:00:35] Jesus said, "Go ye in all the world and
[1:00:36] preach the gospel." Oh, but by the way,
[1:00:38] if you come up on any natives that are
[1:00:40] out there working and sweating, they'll
[1:00:41] be okay. Just bypass them.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; What lud what what kind of a mentality
[1:00:47] does that even take?
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; All you got to do is just work and sweat
[1:00:50] to know God.
[1:00:52] James 4:6 through7 says, "But he giveth
[1:00:55] more grace. Wherefore he saith, God
[1:00:58] resisteth the proud, but giveth grace
[1:01:01] unto the humble. Submit yourselves
[1:01:03] therefore to God. Resist the devil and
[1:01:06] he will flee from you.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Now we know also in Isaiah 35:8 it says,
[1:01:13] "And a highway shall be there and a way
[1:01:16] and it shall be called the way of
[1:01:18] holiness. The unclean shall not pass
[1:01:21] over it, but it shall be for those the
[1:01:23] wayfairing men, though fools shall not
[1:01:25] heir therein." And in John 14 3-6 it
[1:01:29] says and if I go and Jesus speaking to
[1:01:32] the disciples and if I go and prepare a
[1:01:34] place for you I will come again and
[1:01:37] receive you unto myself and that where I
[1:01:39] am there ye may be also and wheither I
[1:01:42] go ye know and the way you know. He's
[1:01:45] telling them you know where I'm going
[1:01:46] you know the way. And Thomas says unto
[1:01:50] him,"Lord, we don't know where you're
[1:01:52] going. And how and how can we know the
[1:01:55] way?" And I could just see Jesus smile
[1:01:57] at him. Jesus saith unto him, "I am the
[1:02:00] way.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; I'm the way, the truth, and the life. No
[1:02:04] man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[1:02:07] Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for that? He
[1:02:10] is the way. No, it ain't it ain't about
[1:02:12] any way that you think you want to get
[1:02:13] out there. And that's what the world
[1:02:15] thinks. They don't want the the oldtime
[1:02:17] gospel. What they want is something
[1:02:19] that's hyped up or some kind of uh show
[1:02:21] that they want to put on some kind of
[1:02:23] production and think that God's in it.
[1:02:25] But let me tell you something. God is
[1:02:26] only going to meet you at Calvary. He's
[1:02:28] only going to meet that blood sacrifice
[1:02:30] and that's it. Nothing else. Not your
[1:02:33] works, not your trophies, not your
[1:02:35] music, nothing else. It's only going to
[1:02:37] be the blood and the blood alone. Amen.
[1:02:39] Amen.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; But you know what man wants to do is so
[1:02:43] different from the King of glory in
[1:02:45] Philippians 2:18. I want to turn there
[1:02:48] right fast and I want to I was talking
[1:02:50] to a man the other day. I've got to I
[1:02:52] got to hurry here in just a moment. I
[1:02:53] was talking to a man the other day and
[1:02:54] he was asking me some questions and he
[1:02:57] was saying it like you know when people
[1:02:59] say these things to you and they say
[1:03:01] this and they say that and I caught it
[1:03:03] that he was really asking me these
[1:03:05] questions. He was acting like somebody
[1:03:07] else had been asking him, but it's kind
[1:03:08] of like, you know, it's like, yeah, I I
[1:03:11] got a friend and they got a problem. But
[1:03:15] here's what here's what it really was.
[1:03:17] So, Phil, I got to turn find Philippians
[1:03:19] here. Um, so Philippians 2 1-8.
[1:03:26] And it says, I don't have to read one
[1:03:28] through eight.
[1:03:30] Why don't we read uh verse three?
[1:03:34] Philippians 2:3. Let nothing be done
[1:03:36] through strife or vain glory, but in
[1:03:39] loneliness of mind. Let each esteem
[1:03:42] other than themselves.
[1:03:45] Boy, that's the mark that that's the
[1:03:46] mark of narcissism, ain't it? Absolutely
[1:03:48] not. That's the opposite of narcissism.
[1:03:51] When you esteem others better than
[1:03:55] themselves. I was talking to a brother
[1:03:57] the other day and and we were talking
[1:03:59] about this subject and he said, "Brother
[1:04:00] Joe," he said, he's a pastor and he
[1:04:02] said, "Brother Joe," he said, "I was
[1:04:04] just down praying the other morning and
[1:04:07] he said, "I was thinking about the
[1:04:08] brothers that go to my church." And he's
[1:04:10] like, he said, "God," he said, "Why did
[1:04:13] you call me to pastor these brothers?"
[1:04:14] He said, "They're much greater than I
[1:04:16] am. They they they love you, Lord, with
[1:04:18] all their heart, and I I feel so
[1:04:19] inadequate, and I I don't feel like I'm
[1:04:22] even worthy to be their pastor." and and
[1:04:23] and Lord, why the same thing I've said
[1:04:26] many times. And he said when I prayed
[1:04:28] that, Brother Joe, he said a bucket of
[1:04:30] the Holy Ghost came down upon me. And it
[1:04:32] was like God was speaking to him and
[1:04:33] saying, "That's exactly how I want you
[1:04:35] to feel.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Don't ever feel like you're the big
[1:04:38] shot. Don't ever feel like you're the
[1:04:40] big cheese, but always make yourself
[1:04:42] little." Amen. Be the little one. God
[1:04:45] will lift you up every time.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:04:50] Look not every man on his own things,
[1:04:52] but every man also on the things of
[1:04:54] others. Verse five, let this mind be in
[1:04:57] you, which was which was also in Christ
[1:04:59] Jesus, who being in the form of God,
[1:05:02] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:05:03] God, but made himself of no reputation.
[1:05:07] And he was asking me, he said, he said,
[1:05:09] "How would a God," they asked me these
[1:05:11] questions, "How would a God allow little
[1:05:13] children to be murdered or women to be
[1:05:15] ravished?" And and how would a God allow
[1:05:17] these things? And and I just stopped
[1:05:19] there for a minute and I realized that
[1:05:21] he was asking me this question and he
[1:05:23] was asking me, you know, you get this
[1:05:24] question all the time about Christianity
[1:05:26] and why why do you believe in a God who
[1:05:28] would allow these things to take place?
[1:05:31] And I said, well, you know, they had a
[1:05:34] choice in the Garden of Eden.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; I said, you have a choice.
[1:05:41] God, it is not his will that any should
[1:05:44] perish
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; that but that all would have eternal
[1:05:47] life. I said, "But God knows who will
[1:05:48] and who won't. But it your will of who
[1:05:52] you will choose. God has given each one
[1:05:55] of us free will. He's given you. He's
[1:05:58] given it to me. He knows who's going to
[1:06:00] take it,
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; but he's still given it to you. We're
[1:06:03] not puppets. We're not running around
[1:06:05] and robots. We're not programmed." Amen.
[1:06:08] But we have free will to choose. And he
[1:06:10] told Adam and Eve, he put that in the
[1:06:12] Garden of Eden. That was a choice for
[1:06:14] them to make. He could have taken the
[1:06:16] tree away and there'd be no choice. And
[1:06:18] you know what? There wouldn't be any
[1:06:20] death. There wouldn't be any children
[1:06:21] ravaged. There wouldn't be any murders.
[1:06:23] There wouldn't be any wars. But God made
[1:06:26] us with a an opportunity to choose the
[1:06:30] right way or the wrong way. And I said,
[1:06:33] I said, if you God never forces any man
[1:06:36] to follow him. He's not going to force
[1:06:39] you to choose him. He's not going to
[1:06:41] force you. He will extend a hand to you.
[1:06:43] He'll send mercy to you,
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; but he's not going to force you. And and
[1:06:47] and and just as Satan is pretty much
[1:06:50] helpless without somebody to work
[1:06:52] through, these people have rejected that
[1:06:54] way. This same self-will that everybody
[1:06:57] wants that they fuss at God. I don't
[1:06:58] have a choice. Yes, you do have a
[1:07:00] choice. Now, here is the repercussions
[1:07:03] of man's choice. Here are the murders.
[1:07:06] Here's all the things that are going on.
[1:07:08] It's the it's the repercussions of the
[1:07:10] choice that man has has has made. And
[1:07:14] and and and so he he told me another
[1:07:16] fellow told me this one time. He said,
[1:07:18] "Well, you know how?" He said, "I I just
[1:07:20] try to show the light of God in the
[1:07:22] world by doing good." I said, "You just
[1:07:24] answered your own question." I said,
[1:07:25] "Because you are showing the light of
[1:07:27] God. They are not." So now they are
[1:07:30] showing the darkness of Satan through
[1:07:31] them, but it's their choice, and your
[1:07:34] choice is is to serve God. So, when they
[1:07:36] come at you with these with all of these
[1:07:39] uh these uh questions and and little
[1:07:41] statements like that, just know they're
[1:07:43] trying to bait you. They really want to
[1:07:44] know. They really want to know because
[1:07:45] the devil has been tempting them. But
[1:07:47] just come at them with some truth. The
[1:07:49] reason why because man has chosen to go
[1:07:51] that way.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Now, we all live in a sin- cursed world
[1:07:55] and we know that. And I said, "What?
[1:07:57] What? What kind of a God would stand up
[1:07:59] and say, oh, bow down or I'm going to
[1:08:02] slay you right now?" No, he didn't do
[1:08:03] that. But what he did do is he came down
[1:08:06] right here in Philippians. It says here,
[1:08:07] "But he made himself of no reputation."
[1:08:09] Verse 7, "and took upon him the form of
[1:08:12] a servant. Washed dirty stinking feet is
[1:08:15] what he did. He got down and washed
[1:08:17] stinking feet with manure on it."
[1:08:19] Brother Ram said that from the trail and
[1:08:21] the dust and the dirt. Think of it. the
[1:08:25] Lord of glory, the the the the the God
[1:08:27] of eternity, Elohim, the allsufficient
[1:08:31] one, the almighty God, who condescended
[1:08:35] down and became and and and in the form
[1:08:38] of a man and a servant and washed the
[1:08:42] stinking feet of his disciples. Amen.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; And being found in the fashion as a man,
[1:08:48] he humbled himself and became obedient
[1:08:51] unto death, even of the cross. The most
[1:08:56] humiliating way to die. It was a it was
[1:08:58] a pagan way to die. The, you know, the
[1:09:00] the Assyrians, I believe, or the uh the
[1:09:02] the the Persians invented it. I believe
[1:09:05] the Phoenetians invented that. The
[1:09:07] Romans adopted it. And it was a horrible
[1:09:09] way for a man to die. Amen.
[1:09:13] I'm so glad that we serve a God that
[1:09:18] humbled himself.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this. He says, "Oh,
[1:09:23] be conscious. Here is only one thing to
[1:09:26] be conscious of your littleness. If you
[1:09:29] want to get somewhere with God, make
[1:09:31] yourself real little."
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; So then, make yourself the influence of
[1:09:37] another. He says, "So then make yourself
[1:09:39] little. Humble yourself before God.
[1:09:41] recognize. Don't get all puffed up and
[1:09:43] blow up. Search the scriptures and see
[1:09:46] if it's right. He says this on the same
[1:09:49] message. Always notice a big man humbles
[1:09:52] himself. The way up is down. Always make
[1:09:56] yourself little and God will bring you
[1:09:58] up. He that exalts himself shall be
[1:10:01] abased, but he that humbles himself
[1:10:03] shall be exalted. Oh my, I like that.
[1:10:06] Make yourself little. Always be little.
[1:10:09] Don't be the big shot. be the little
[1:10:11] fellow. See, God is the only one among
[1:10:13] us that's big. Anyhow, I'm going to read
[1:10:16] two more scriptures and then we'll
[1:10:18] close.
[1:10:20] But I want to read, go back to Psalms
[1:10:23] 139. And when you do that, I want you to
[1:10:26] go to Romans 7 and hold that place. I'm
[1:10:29] sorry, Romans 8.
[1:10:31] Romans 8, but go to Psalm 139 again.
[1:10:36] And I want you to look at this in a
[1:10:37] different light.
[1:10:39] I want you to look at who David's really
[1:10:42] hating.
[1:10:46] I was in prayer the other morning when I
[1:10:47] was reading this and and the Lord just
[1:10:50] spoke to me and I was like,
[1:10:54] "Lord, that's me.
[1:10:56] I'm David. I I I'm I'm experiencing
[1:11:00] exactly I read Psalm 139, how great he
[1:11:02] is and how much he knows my downsitting,
[1:11:04] my uprising, and all that. But then
[1:11:06] David comes down. He starts talking
[1:11:08] about all of his enemies. And let me
[1:11:10] tell you something. You and I have
[1:11:12] enemies. But I'm gonna tell you who your
[1:11:14] biggest enemy is.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna tell you in just a minute. I
[1:11:18] asked Brother Slay one time. He's a
[1:11:20] precious brother, pastor church, 88
[1:11:21] years old, been preaching the gospel way
[1:11:23] longer than I've been alive. And I asked
[1:11:25] him, I said, "Brother Slay down in
[1:11:27] Panama City." I said, I said, "I know
[1:11:30] you've you've had some some people in
[1:11:32] your church that's caused trouble, ain't
[1:11:34] a ain't you?" He said, "Yeah." He said,
[1:11:35] "I I have." I was trying to get some
[1:11:37] advice from him when I started
[1:11:38] pastoring. I said, "What to look for and
[1:11:41] what to guard against." And I said,
[1:11:42] 'Boy, I was hoping he'd give me, "Well,
[1:11:44] I'm going to tell you about this brother
[1:11:45] one time that did this and this sister
[1:11:46] that come in and did this." But you know
[1:11:48] what he told me? He said, "Brother Joe,
[1:11:50] I'm going to tell you the person that's
[1:11:52] given me the most trouble my whole life
[1:11:55] has been the man that walks between
[1:11:56] these two elbows."
[1:12:00] I like that.
[1:12:04] That was the best I had ever heard. That
[1:12:06] was the best advice I could have ever
[1:12:08] gotten because let let me tell you
[1:12:10] something. It ain't always about your
[1:12:11] external enemies out there. That they're
[1:12:13] going to come. You're going to have
[1:12:14] trials. You're going to have problems.
[1:12:16] But your biggest enemy is you.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Your biggest enemy is you. That's the
[1:12:21] old fella that gets up in the morning
[1:12:22] wants to be pampered. That's the old guy
[1:12:24] that gets his hurt and feelings hurt all
[1:12:25] the time. That's the old guy that's all
[1:12:27] about me me. But that's the true enemy
[1:12:29] that you've got.
[1:12:31] David when he's speaking here he says oh
[1:12:34] he says he says in verse 19 surely thou
[1:12:38] will slay the wicked let me tell you
[1:12:40] something when you become a new creation
[1:12:42] that old man is going to be dead
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; you have died un living under Christ you
[1:12:48] die to your old self oh I'm praying
[1:12:50] every day God slay that wicked man
[1:12:52] that's in me
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; for they speak I'm speaking to myself
[1:12:58] speaks against thee wickedly and thine
[1:13:00] enemies as me take your name in vain. Do
[1:13:03] not I hate them? I hate that part of me
[1:13:05] that does that. Don't you?
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; I want to be that man of God that can
[1:13:09] stand and overcome every battle that
[1:13:10] comes against me. But I've got an enemy
[1:13:13] that constantly wars against me day and
[1:13:15] night, night and day.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; I hate that enemy. Oh, I hate him. Verse
[1:13:21] 21. Oh Lord, that hate thee, and I'm am
[1:13:24] I not grieved with those that rise up
[1:13:26] against me. I hate that part of me that
[1:13:28] is always coming against God, coming
[1:13:30] against the right thing, not somebody
[1:13:33] else out there. That narcissistic spirit
[1:13:35] was somebody else's fault. That's why I
[1:13:37] ain't in church. Somebody said something
[1:13:39] wrong to me. Somebody had an attitude or
[1:13:41] preacher didn't shake my hand or or I
[1:13:43] don't like this or I don't like that.
[1:13:44] Me, me, me. Always about me. Let me tell
[1:13:47] you something right now. If you ever
[1:13:49] really get born again of the spirit of
[1:13:51] God, those little things won't bother
[1:13:53] you no more. You'll say, "If I'm the
[1:13:54] only one going there, I'm going to come
[1:13:56] to church on Wednesday night, whatever
[1:13:58] night it is, I'm going to be the one
[1:14:00] raising my hands. I'm going to be the
[1:14:02] one that's pulling on that preacher as
[1:14:04] hard as I can pull."
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Cuz it ain't me and Brother Steve. It
[1:14:09] ain't me and Brother David. Amen. It
[1:14:11] ain't me and Brother Micah. It's me and
[1:14:14] the Lord.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. I got
[1:14:16] enemies that go with me everywhere I go.
[1:14:18] They ride in the truck with me. They're
[1:14:19] in the bed with me. They're at the house
[1:14:21] with me. in the shower with they're
[1:14:22] wherever I'm at those enemies but I hate
[1:14:24] them and they hate God and that's the
[1:14:27] part I want to kill with everything
[1:14:29] that's in me.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; It hates God.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; I hate them with a perfect hatred. I
[1:14:37] count them mine enemies. I'm going to
[1:14:39] prove to you in just a minute who your
[1:14:42] enemy is.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Search me, oh God,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; and know what my enemies know. Know my
[1:14:49] heart.
[1:14:51] Try me and know my thoughts.
[1:14:54] Where is the battleground at between God
[1:14:57] and Satan? Brother Bram said they chose
[1:15:00] a battleground and that's your mind.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; That's your thoughts. That's when
[1:15:04] somebody says a little thing and you get
[1:15:05] huffed up about it. You say, "Oh, if
[1:15:07] that's the way they feel about I'm not
[1:15:08] going to talk to them." Oh, that's your
[1:15:10] thoughts. Slay that enemy. Slay that
[1:15:14] wicked enemy because it hates you and it
[1:15:16] hates God and it's going to drive you
[1:15:17] away from fellowship. It'll drive you
[1:15:19] away from this church. It'll put a wedge
[1:15:21] between you and your pastor. It'll put a
[1:15:23] wedge between you and your wife, between
[1:15:24] you and your husband, between you and
[1:15:26] your friends.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, it will. Yes, sir.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; It's all about me. What they did to me,
[1:15:30] what so- and so said about me. We've got
[1:15:32] to slay that enemy.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; And see if there be any wicked way in me
[1:15:41] and lead me in the way of everlasting.
[1:15:45] Hallelujah. Oh god, I just want to die.
[1:15:49] Man was asking me the other day, the
[1:15:51] same man. He said, "What about baptism?
[1:15:52] You believe in sprinkling?" I said, "Oh,
[1:15:54] I had a good opportunity."
[1:15:56] I said, "Let me tell you something. The
[1:15:59] Bible tells us in Romans, it says right
[1:16:03] there where I'm going to, why don't we
[1:16:04] just read that in Romans 7,
[1:16:08] let me just see if I can find that.
[1:16:14] Romans 8.
[1:16:22] Yeah, let's just read that in Romans 7.
[1:16:24] But I was talking to him about about
[1:16:26] being baptized. And Paul said that we
[1:16:29] are dead to sin
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; and we're buried with him in baptism.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Buried with him in baptism. I'm trying
[1:16:39] to find it. My eyes are all watered up.
[1:16:41] We're dead to sin. re that uh we should
[1:16:44] bring forth
[1:16:46] maybe a sin six anyway. Anyway, but I
[1:16:48] said we're dead to sin. We're raised to
[1:16:51] walk in the newness of life.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and I said what is it?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Romans 6.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Romans 6. Amen. So we're we're yeah to
[1:16:59] raise therefore we're buried with him by
[1:17:02] baptism into death that like as Christ
[1:17:05] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[1:17:07] of the father even so we also should
[1:17:10] walk in the newness of life. And I said,
[1:17:12] "Why are we baptized to start with?" And
[1:17:14] he's like, "To wash away our sins." I
[1:17:16] said, "No, water don't do that. Water
[1:17:18] just gets you wet." I said, "What water
[1:17:20] is is you are fulfilling the covenant
[1:17:21] that God has made with you and you're
[1:17:23] obeying what God has said to do
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; is to take on his life." And the only
[1:17:28] way that you can do that is through the
[1:17:30] baptism in his name. Is that right?
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Not father, son, holy ghost, not Harry,
[1:17:35] Christian, nobody else, but it's the
[1:17:36] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:39] And I said I said if you're buried I
[1:17:41] ain't never seen a dead man out there
[1:17:42] with a handful of dirt just sprinkled on
[1:17:44] him to lay out there for buzzards. No,
[1:17:46] they bury him all the way down. You
[1:17:48] don't see him. You don't see him
[1:17:49] anymore. That old man is gone. He's dead
[1:17:51] and buried.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; And what rises from then on. As Paul
[1:17:56] said, it's not I that live, but it's
[1:17:58] Christ that lives within me. Is that
[1:18:00] right?
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; That's well that's the that's how I
[1:18:03] believe in baptism. He said he asked me
[1:18:04] if I believed in immersion or
[1:18:06] sprinkling. I said, "Oh my, I had a good
[1:18:08] chance to tell him now." But what it
[1:18:11] says here, you want to know who your
[1:18:13] enemy is? Verse 5, chapter 8, verse 5.
[1:18:17] For they that are after the flesh do
[1:18:19] mind the things of the flesh, but they
[1:18:22] that are after the spirit the things of
[1:18:24] the spirit. For to be carnally minded is
[1:18:26] death, but to be spiritually minded is
[1:18:29] life and peace. Listen, because the
[1:18:32] carnal mind is enmity against God. It is
[1:18:36] the enemy of God. That's the wicked man.
[1:18:38] Amen.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; For it is not subject to the law of God,
[1:18:43] neither indeed can it be.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Let me read verse 11. But if the spirit
[1:18:52] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[1:18:54] dead dwell in you, he that rise raised
[1:18:58] up Christ from the dead shall also
[1:19:00] quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[1:19:04] that dwelleth in you. Amen. It's going
[1:19:06] to make you alive. It's going to make
[1:19:08] you walk different. It's going to make
[1:19:09] you talk different. Jesus said, "The
[1:19:11] work, he that believeth in me, the works
[1:19:12] that I do shall you do also." A lot of
[1:19:15] folks think, "Well, I can just live any
[1:19:16] old way I want to live." God knows my
[1:19:18] heart. God knows I try to do all the the
[1:19:20] best I I can do. Let me tell you
[1:19:21] something. Try a little bit harder. You
[1:19:23] need to surrender everything in your
[1:19:25] mind, in your life that is an enemy to
[1:19:28] God. One by if it's just one little
[1:19:30] pebble at a time. Start speaking to that
[1:19:32] mountain. If you say to this mountain,
[1:19:34] as Jesus said, speak to this mountain,
[1:19:37] whatever that mountain might be in your
[1:19:38] life, it might be an old bad habit. It
[1:19:40] might be a big habit. It might be a new
[1:19:42] habit. It might be whatever kind of
[1:19:43] habit it might be. But start speaking to
[1:19:45] that mountain because that mountain's
[1:19:47] between you and God. But he said, "If
[1:19:48] you speak to this mountain and believe
[1:19:50] that it'll move and don't doubt in your
[1:19:52] heart, you shall have what you ask."
[1:19:54] Brother Brandham said, the original
[1:19:55] Bible, what it says in the original
[1:19:57] text, if you speak under this mountain
[1:19:59] and believe that it is being done,
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; you shall have what you ask. A lot of
[1:20:05] times it may not be overnight. You say,
[1:20:06] "Well, I've prayed." Pray again. You You
[1:20:08] say, "Well, I prayed a month ago." Pray
[1:20:09] again. Keep praying. Don't stop praying.
[1:20:12] Don't stop praying. Just keep on
[1:20:14] praying,
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; believing that God's going to take that
[1:20:17] thing from you. God's going to help you
[1:20:18] one battle at a time. One is Let me tell
[1:20:21] you something. When you pick up a sword,
[1:20:23] you can't swing it, but just this way.
[1:20:24] And then you come back swinging that way
[1:20:26] and just one enemy at a time. Just it
[1:20:28] might and every lick don't always kill
[1:20:30] the enemy. Sometimes he'll back up a
[1:20:31] little bit. Whoa, buddy. Then you come
[1:20:33] back at him again. Whatever it takes,
[1:20:35] but you just keep fighting with
[1:20:36] everything that's within you.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; May the musicians come up.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; You you you you say, "Well, brother Joe,
[1:20:49] what causes that narcissism?" They don't
[1:20:51] know. Psychologists don't know. I've
[1:20:54] read about it. It said, "Well, it's
[1:20:55] because they spoil children so much and
[1:20:57] give them everything they want and give
[1:20:58] them this false sense of exaltation that
[1:21:01] they're the greatest thing and they go
[1:21:02] through all their life thinking that
[1:21:04] they're the greatest thing." But then I
[1:21:05] read another one that said, "Oh, it's
[1:21:07] parents who neglect their children." I'm
[1:21:09] like, well, you can't get no farther
[1:21:11] apart than that. So, somebody's right
[1:21:13] and somebody's wrong. What it is, they
[1:21:15] have no idea. I tell you, it's the devil
[1:21:17] is who it is. It's Satan. And and I and
[1:21:20] I don't point fingers at nobody and say,
[1:21:21] "Well, he's this or she's that or
[1:21:23] whatever." You just point that finger
[1:21:24] back at you
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; and say, "God, you help me." Now, if
[1:21:27] you're going through something like that
[1:21:28] in your life, the the only thing that
[1:21:30] you can do is ask God to deliver that
[1:21:32] person. If somebody else is in your life
[1:21:34] who's like that, just pray. Say, "God, I
[1:21:37] recognize what that is." Because the way
[1:21:38] the devil can hide, the only way he can
[1:21:40] stay there is when he's he's hidden. But
[1:21:42] once he's exposed and you recognize, is
[1:21:44] this a personality trait? What is this?
[1:21:46] Let me tell you something. If it's
[1:21:47] anything other than what the Bible tells
[1:21:49] us to be humble like Christ was, if it's
[1:21:52] anything other than humility, if it's
[1:21:54] anything other than a forgiving spirit,
[1:21:56] if it's anything other than a spirit
[1:21:58] that wants to reconcile, this is the
[1:22:00] gospel of reconciliation. It ain't the
[1:22:02] gospel of separation. It ain't the
[1:22:04] gospel of driving wedges and the gospel
[1:22:06] of cutting this and cutting that. It's
[1:22:08] the gospel of reconciliation to be
[1:22:11] reconciled to one another. That's the
[1:22:14] spirit that we should have. We don't
[1:22:16] always ain't there ain't no great
[1:22:18] preachers and this one and that one and
[1:22:19] we go, "No, we're we're following after
[1:22:22] Jesus Christ." What is this message? I
[1:22:24] heard Charles Stanley say this on the
[1:22:26] radio like the floored me. I was going
[1:22:28] down a road about wrecked. He said, "We
[1:22:30] have missed the message." He's a Baptist
[1:22:32] church up in uh Baptist preacher. Passed
[1:22:34] away recently, but he had a church up in
[1:22:36] Atlanta. Big name. Everybody heard of
[1:22:38] Charles Stanley. He said, "We've missed
[1:22:39] the message." I said, "What?"
[1:22:42] He said, "The message is Jesus Christ."
[1:22:48] That's what the message is.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Message is Jesus Christ.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; This Bible, as much as I love it, it'll
[1:22:57] never do me any good sitting right
[1:22:58] there.
[1:23:00] It'll never do me no good. Those words
[1:23:02] on there are just ink
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; and paper. But there's something so
[1:23:08] miraculous about it
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; that if you read the same word now, it's
[1:23:13] got to be the right spirit. You've got
[1:23:15] to read it with the right heart, with
[1:23:16] the right attitude. And you read this
[1:23:19] word of God and you say, "Let me tell
[1:23:21] you, let me give you a little advice.
[1:23:23] Pray before you even open the Bible."
[1:23:24] You say, "Well, I've been a Christian a
[1:23:25] long time. Who cares?" Pray before you
[1:23:28] open the Bible and say, "God, speak to
[1:23:30] me." You don't have to start off with
[1:23:33] some great saliloquy or this great big
[1:23:35] flowing prayer. Jesus said not to do
[1:23:37] that stuff. He said, "Don't don't come
[1:23:39] up with," oh gracious God of eternity.
[1:23:44] Just speak to him with a honest heart.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Speak to him. I don't care if it's five
[1:23:49] minutes in the morning. If it's a minute
[1:23:51] in the morning, put down that old
[1:23:52] stinking iPhone for a minute.
[1:23:55] put it down for a minute and just sit
[1:23:56] down at the table before you go out to
[1:23:58] work or before you go to school or
[1:24:00] wherever you're going to go and just sit
[1:24:01] down and say, "God, I I need your help
[1:24:04] today.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; I'm facing enemies,
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; mostly in me,
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; but the devil's he's on the war path all
[1:24:11] the time."
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Help me today, Lord. Let me read
[1:24:15] something in your word.
[1:24:17] And then open the Bible and read that
[1:24:20] scripture. Read a chapter. If you feel
[1:24:22] like reading it, something inspires you,
[1:24:24] keep on reading. And then when you get
[1:24:26] done, close the Bible and then pray
[1:24:28] again and say, "Oh God, thank you for
[1:24:30] the word I read. Now seal that word to
[1:24:33] my heart." You be surprised how how what
[1:24:36] a difference that'll make in your day.
[1:24:38] You'll be surprised what a change it'll
[1:24:40] make in your life. It's a little by
[1:24:42] little. The devil don't come in all of a
[1:24:44] sudden a lot of times, but it's the
[1:24:46] little foxes that spoil the vine. It's
[1:24:47] the little things, but we can do the
[1:24:49] same thing. It's a little by little.
[1:24:51] It's a little by little and before you
[1:24:52] know it, that one minute prayer becomes
[1:24:54] two minutes. And before you know it,
[1:24:56] that two minutes might become five
[1:24:57] minutes. And next thing you know, you
[1:24:59] might be finding yourself with your
[1:25:00] hands raised with tears running down
[1:25:02] your eyes, caught up in the spirit of
[1:25:04] God, praying, hallelujah, unto God,
[1:25:06] something inside of you else praying.
[1:25:08] Something else is now taking over.
[1:25:10] You're raising up into higher heights.
[1:25:12] You're going in the deeper depths.
[1:25:13] You're never going to get anywhere with
[1:25:15] God if you don't read your Bible and
[1:25:16] pray. And you say, "That's so simple,
[1:25:19] Brother Joe. mean you come all the way
[1:25:20] two hours to tell us that? Yes, I did. I
[1:25:23] I've come here two-hour drive to tell
[1:25:25] you to read your Bible and to pray and
[1:25:28] to seek God to to slay that enemy that's
[1:25:31] within you. Don't worry about your
[1:25:32] brother out there. God will take care of
[1:25:34] him.
[1:25:36] Amen. Slay that enemy that is within
[1:25:39] you. Amen.
[1:25:41] What is that song y'all playing? It
[1:25:42] sounds awful good. Search me, oh God.
[1:25:47] How hold on a minute. I love that. But I
[1:25:51] had another song picked out. It was
[1:25:54] Search Me, Lord.
[1:25:56] It's But we'll sing that one first.
[1:26:00] Search

[1:26:58] way
[1:27:01] in me.
[1:27:08] Oh, cleanse me
[1:27:12] from
[1:27:15] every sin
[1:27:18] and set
[1:27:21] me
[1:27:24] free.
[1:27:26] Oh my, I could have just got up and sung
[1:27:28] that song tonight. That's absolutely the
[1:27:31] message I just preached. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:27:34] search me, oh God.
[1:27:37] Hallelujah.
[1:27:38] Don't you want him to search your heart?
[1:27:41] Oh, I don't want to get there on that
[1:27:42] day, on that great day.
[1:27:45] You came to church, but did you ever
[1:27:48] pray? Did you ever consecrate your life?
[1:27:51] Did you ever say, "Lord, take everything
[1:27:54] in me that's not like you. I want to
[1:27:56] hate that thing in me that's against you
[1:27:58] with a with a hatred, Lord.
[1:28:02] Oh, search my heart, oh God. See if
[1:28:04] there be any wicked way found in me.
[1:28:09] Amen. Now, I got another song here. I'm
[1:28:12] going to try to play it.
[1:28:16] We'll try it in G. What What key was

[1:28:54] Oh, why don't you shine a light from
[1:28:58] heaven
[1:28:59] on my soul?
[1:29:02] Oh,

[1:32:59] that I'm not aware,
[1:33:02] won't you take it, move it, keep me in
[1:33:08] your care?
[1:33:11] Oh, search me, Lord.
[1:33:16] Oh, yes. Search me, Lord.
[1:33:21] Shine a light. Shine a light. Shine a
[1:33:25] light from heaven
[1:33:28] in my soul.

[1:34:16] find anything, shouldn't be, should it
[1:34:20] be, take it out, Lord,

[1:34:49] [Music]
[1:34:51] Search me, Lord.
[1:34:57] Won't you shine
[1:35:00] a light from heaven
[1:35:04] down in my soul?
[1:35:08] [Music]
[1:35:10] If you find
[1:35:12] anything
[1:35:14] that shouldn't be,
[1:35:17] take it out, Lord, and straighten me.
[1:35:21] I want to be right.
[1:35:24] I want to be saved.
[1:35:28] I want to be whole.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen, brother Matt.
[1:35:39] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:35:46] God's just looking for somebody that's
[1:35:49] going to believe him,
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; somebody that's going to humble theirel,
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; not be puffed up and prideful.
[1:35:58] It's kind of hard to find nowadays.
[1:36:02] Even in church,
[1:36:04] a lot of times that's exactly where the
[1:36:06] devil fights the hardest.
[1:36:08] hurt feelings and
[1:36:10] maybe somebody wants to get promoted
[1:36:12] into a position.
[1:36:14] They want to get ahead of God.
[1:36:17] Satan can use every bit of that
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; in the house of God. But I just pray
[1:36:22] that
[1:36:26] we can all find
[1:36:29] find that thing in our life that is
[1:36:31] keeping us that keeps us from that place
[1:36:34] that we know that we need to be.
[1:36:37] find that little thing in there
[1:36:39] somewhere that's keeping us. We just get
[1:36:41] rid of that thing. You're always going
[1:36:43] to have that thing. It's always going to
[1:36:45] be a struggle, but we can just keep
[1:36:48] striving. Amen. Every day, pressing
[1:36:50] onward. Is that right? We've got to
[1:36:52] press the battle. That's what they told
[1:36:54] Brother Brandon when he went beyond the
[1:36:55] curtain of time. Press the battle. Just
[1:36:58] keep fighting. Amen, brother. Man, come
[1:37:00] on. God bless y'all.
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:07] You appreciate the word of the Lord
[1:37:08] tonight. Why don't we give the Lord
[1:37:10] Jesus a hand clap of praise?
[1:37:15] [Applause]
[1:37:16] Amen.
[1:37:19] And renew arise spirit.
[1:37:23] Why don't we gather to the front as we
[1:37:25] sing in this? Cast me not away. Sing it.
[1:37:30] Oh, and cast me not
[1:37:35] away
[1:37:37] from thy presence,
[1:37:42] oh Lord.
[1:37:45] Raise your hands now. Take
[1:37:48] not thy holy
[1:37:51] spirit from me.
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:59] Restore
[1:38:02] unto me.
[1:38:05] Oh, all the joy
[1:38:10] salvation.
[1:38:13] Oh, and renew arise spirit.
[1:38:19] Well, we want to sing it just before we
[1:38:21] pray for these needs. Let's sing that
[1:38:23] again. Cast me not away. Oh Lord, cast
[1:38:29] me down
[1:38:31] away
[1:38:32] from thy presence,
[1:38:37] oh Lord,
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:41] and take
[1:38:43] not thy holy
[1:38:46] spirit from me,
[1:38:54] but restore Oh,
[1:38:57] [Music]
[1:39:01] all the joy of thy salvation.
[1:39:08] Oh, and renew arise spirit
[1:39:14] within me.
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you appreciate that? My
[1:39:23] goodness, brother Joe, that was so
[1:39:24] wonderful. You know, I love reminded me
[1:39:27] so much what brother Joe preached in the
[1:39:30] greatest battle ever fought. He read
[1:39:31] that quote out of there. Satan ain't a
[1:39:33] demon spirit's almost harmless unless he
[1:39:35] has somebody to work through, something
[1:39:38] to work in. And I say, Lord, don't let
[1:39:39] it be me.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother Brandham said, clean
[1:39:42] out every channel. How many want to do
[1:39:44] that?
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; And he said, what do you do? You take
[1:39:46] the word of the Lord, the sword of the
[1:39:48] spirit with a strong hand of faith. You
[1:39:50] know what I love about that sermon,
[1:39:51] greatest battle, is brother Brandon
[1:39:53] flips the entire script of a defensive
[1:39:56] Christian, you know, hiding from the
[1:39:57] devil, running from the devil. And he
[1:39:59] says, "No, that's not what we do. We
[1:40:01] charge the enemy and we knock him out."
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, "What do you
[1:40:06] do when a demon spirit comes? You got
[1:40:08] some spooky spirit," he said, trying to
[1:40:10] come around you. Don't cower. He said,
[1:40:12] "Whack him with the word of God."
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "If he don't
[1:40:15] leave, whack him again. And if he don't
[1:40:18] leave, whack him again.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; And you keep whacking him until you get
[1:40:22] victory. How many want to be an a
[1:40:24] soldier? Say, "Lord, I'm not going to
[1:40:25] back down to the devil. I'm going to
[1:40:27] take the word and cut the devil's head
[1:40:29] off." Amen. Whack him again. Whack him
[1:40:32] until you're free. Amen. Thank you,
[1:40:34] brother Joe. That was so wonderful.
[1:40:36] Amen. My goodness. I think that uh
[1:40:38] there's none of that that that you know,
[1:40:40] all the traits and all the things as
[1:40:43] David said, "Lord, search me." If
[1:40:44] there's any part of that that I could
[1:40:46] and and friends I'll be honest I'll just
[1:40:48] say I'll be the first to say there was
[1:40:50] parts of that I could identify with
[1:40:52] little things here and there and you
[1:40:53] know and say boy that's you know can see
[1:40:55] that in me you know that like brother
[1:40:57] Brandham said the greatest enemy I have
[1:40:59] is me William Brandom that was the
[1:41:02] greatest enemy Martin Luther said I'm
[1:41:03] not I'm more afraid of the pope in me
[1:41:06] than any pope in Rome
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; more afraid of what what the evil that
[1:41:11] lays within me than anybody else. Amen.
[1:41:13] That's my number one enemy. So, we just
[1:41:15] want to be free. Amen. We have the
[1:41:17] prayer request here. I just want to read
[1:41:18] those tonight. Continued prayer for
[1:41:20] brother David Gadman. Amen. An update
[1:41:23] from his son-in-law, Brother Harry
[1:41:25] Lancaster. Brother David Gadman got out
[1:41:27] of surgery a little before 5:00 p.m. The
[1:41:30] doctor said that the section of the
[1:41:31] colon that they removed was very
[1:41:33] diseased. He was very happy with the
[1:41:35] with how the two healthier sections
[1:41:38] reattached. And thankfully, Brother
[1:41:40] David does not need a um further surgery
[1:41:44] there, even temporarily. He will be in
[1:41:45] the hospital at least through Friday and
[1:41:48] possibly longer depending on how he
[1:41:50] recovers. Amen. Brother David's been a
[1:41:52] faithful servant for the Lord, an
[1:41:54] evangelist. He's blessed our church many
[1:41:56] times. So, we want to just remember him.
[1:41:59] Amen. Sister Lord there, the whole
[1:42:00] family. Sister Amy Demars writes in,
[1:42:02] "Please pray for brother uh Greg Schwarz
[1:42:06] from Minnesota." Some may remember him
[1:42:08] as he helped out the first year of camp.
[1:42:11] He had surgery today to remove a
[1:42:12] cancerous tumor in his mouth. They ended
[1:42:15] up need needing to take out half of his
[1:42:17] tongue and one lymph node. Please pray
[1:42:19] for his recovery and complete healing.
[1:42:22] Brother Joe, I'll have you come and take
[1:42:24] these pray for these needs. Amen. We
[1:42:26] just want to remember our brother Greg.
[1:42:28] Amen. Don't see any other that are
[1:42:30] written down. Maybe you had something
[1:42:32] amen upon your heart. You just want to
[1:42:33] raise your hand to the Lord. Hold that
[1:42:35] knee up. represent that need. Now, don't
[1:42:37] just let Brother Joe do all the praying,
[1:42:39] but let's bind together as a body. These
[1:42:41] are this is serious needs here. So,
[1:42:44] let's join together in prayer.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; David Gadman,
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Brother David Gagman for recovery. Also,
[1:42:48] Brother Greg Schwarz from Greg Tum.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; God certainly knows who that is.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; I know brother Gadman. Matter of fact, I
[1:42:56] just spoke to him today. What was
[1:42:58] talking to him on the phone and and he
[1:43:01] told me about the surgery that he had
[1:43:02] and and uh I just had a feeling. And I
[1:43:05] was telling my wife, I said, "I just
[1:43:06] wonder, I had a feeling something was
[1:43:07] going on with him and I didn't know. Why
[1:43:10] don't we just bow our heads?" Remember,
[1:43:11] our heavenly father, as we come to you

[1:48:23] true. Amen. Thank you, brother Ken.
[1:48:26] Beautiful song. Amen. We're going to
[1:48:28] take just time for a testimony or two.
[1:48:30] You keep playing something for me.
[1:48:31] Anybody got something? Sister Sarah.
[1:48:33] Amen. I heard brother John. Let me give
[1:48:35] this mic back to Sister Sarah. Try that.
[1:48:43] Nope.
[1:48:48] Uh, I hope I can get through this
[1:48:49] without crying. I get a little
[1:48:51] emotional, but um, Monday morning I had
[1:48:54] gotten up and I was sitting on the couch
[1:48:56] and I was praying and um, it just seems
[1:48:59] like Satan's really been pouring it on
[1:49:01] us lately. It's just been one thing
[1:49:03] after another.
[1:49:05] And so I'm sitting on the couch and I
[1:49:07] was praying, pouring my heart out to the
[1:49:08] Lord and I said, "Lord, I can't take
[1:49:10] anymore. I really can't. I'm trying to
[1:49:13] be a brave soldier, but I'm I'm getting
[1:49:15] tired.
[1:49:17] And I looked out the window and there
[1:49:19] was a bald eagle sitting across the pond
[1:49:22] in the grass.
[1:49:24] It was just sitting there and it was
[1:49:25] looking right, it looked like it was
[1:49:27] looking right in the window. And I
[1:49:28] suspected it was because if I moved any
[1:49:30] at all, it would kind of its head a
[1:49:32] little to the side.
[1:49:34] I sat there and I watched it and it sat
[1:49:36] there in the grass for probably 10
[1:49:38] minutes, maybe. I got several pictures,
[1:49:40] sent it to some people, and got ready to
[1:49:44] leave the house cuz I was running late
[1:49:45] for an appointment and I opened the door
[1:49:47] and I thought it'll be gone by the time
[1:49:48] I walk out. I went out there and I stood
[1:49:51] outside and it just stood there looking
[1:49:53] at me. Never flinched, never nothing.
[1:49:55] Just looked at me and I started crying.
[1:49:59] I felt like the Lord was saying, "I've
[1:50:01] got you. I see you."
[1:50:03] And it took its wings a couple of times
[1:50:07] and it flew across the pond. And as it
[1:50:10] flew across, another one come in behind
[1:50:12] it and it flew across the pond. And it
[1:50:14] almost screeched, a loud screech as it
[1:50:16] went over my head and went around into a
[1:50:18] tree.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; And it just meant so much to me. I just
[1:50:22] stood there and cried.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; But I know God sees me and I thank him
[1:50:27] for that because it just meant so much
[1:50:28] to me.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:50:33] Amen.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad the Lord can speak like
[1:50:39] that even in nature? Brother John,
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; I want to thank the Lord for touching
[1:50:47] Elliot and he got a little a virus and
[1:50:50] the Lord's touched him and he's still on
[1:50:52] his way out, you know, a little fussy,
[1:50:55] but I really wanted to testify and thank
[1:50:58] God. You know, Brother Daryl was here. I
[1:51:01] forget how long it's been. A long time
[1:51:02] ago when I was talking about claiming
[1:51:05] your healing and at the time I was
[1:51:06] wearing glasses
[1:51:08] uh and I had just gotten really
[1:51:12] frustrated at work because I was working
[1:51:14] and trying to work and I had a stig a
[1:51:16] stigmatism and
[1:51:20] trying to work and I was in the shower
[1:51:22] and the glasses were clouding up. I was
[1:51:23] like I can't do this anymore. And I just
[1:51:25] took them and smashed them. I was like I
[1:51:27] can't do that. I can't wear glasses. And
[1:51:29] they had they had already told me um I
[1:51:32] had tried contacts. They flared my eyes
[1:51:35] up and she tried several different ones.
[1:51:37] Some of them wouldn't rotate. And that
[1:51:39] weekend I said I'm claiming my healing
[1:51:42] and I'm still claiming it and I expect
[1:51:44] to see it and I'm thanking God and I
[1:51:46] haven't forgotten and I'm not giving up.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:51:52] [Applause]
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Memo. Pass that back to my memo.
[1:52:03] This uh this is from my neighbor. She
[1:52:06] told me to thank the church for praying
[1:52:08] for her last Wednesday night. Uh her
[1:52:10] name is Ruth. She had bronchitis. First
[1:52:12] time in her life. Very very very
[1:52:16] sick. And so I I was talking to her
[1:52:19] Thursday and she said, "You know, I
[1:52:22] really feel better today." I said, "We
[1:52:24] prayed for you last night." She said to
[1:52:26] tell the church, "Thank you." Amen. So,
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; thank the Lord.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; I just had to tell y'all.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:31] [Applause]
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad for what the
