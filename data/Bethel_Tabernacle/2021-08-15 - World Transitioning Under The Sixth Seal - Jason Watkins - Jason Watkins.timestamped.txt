[33:48] update at the nonetheless

[33:53] some special prayer for your mom and dad
[33:55] what's the latest this morning trav so
[33:58] just still symptomatic
[34:07] amen
[34:08] uh my
[34:09] sister's baby sister sherry also

[34:15] about that this morning
[34:17] and uh if it's if it is coveted it'll be
[34:20] actually her third round my
[34:23] so i don't know uh maybe she has a
[34:25] susceptibility to it
[34:28] but i sure feel sorry for her this
[34:29] morning they don't know they haven't
[34:31] confirmed that as far as i know
[34:34] but um still need to pray amen to pray
[34:37] for all of god's family
[34:39] and
[34:40] thank the lord we've
[34:42] heard some good reports recently of some
[34:44] people recovering had a very good friend
[34:47] in south africa brother hendrick and uh
[34:49] streams these services and
[34:51] i can hardly get out of the pulpit and
[34:54] get to my back office and i've already
[34:55] got an email brother jason
[34:58] and you know and they're they're
[35:00] streaming at near midnight so just
[35:02] rejoicing over the word his family there
[35:04] and so i i got an announcement from a
[35:07] brother over there
[35:09] i'm not sure i know him if i've met him
[35:11] i don't remember although his his photo
[35:13] looked familiar
[35:14] but uh brother hendrick and his entire
[35:16] family brother hendrick was in the
[35:18] hospital not doing good and i was just
[35:21] praying for
[35:22] who wouldn't have it and for him and the
[35:24] whole family and then i began to hear
[35:26] well he's a little better today and pray
[35:28] that much harder
[35:29] i'll tell you something friends prayer
[35:30] changes everything
[35:32] it doesn't just change things it changes
[35:34] everything
[35:35] amen and so i
[35:37] was glad to get a good report there
[35:40] that he's pretty much recovered and the
[35:43] family's recovered he's still having
[35:45] some breathing
[35:46] it's not quite what it was so i told him
[35:49] hey we're praying that kind of a prayer
[35:51] for a brother in our church amen so
[35:53] we're going to pray for brother joe and
[35:54] pray for brother hendrick over there in
[35:56] south africa to see full lung capacity
[36:00] return praise the lord amen and then
[36:02] brother jim babb i heard was
[36:05] doing
[36:06] better so we were really praying hard
[36:08] for that one too
[36:09] amen his
[36:11] family
[36:12] wife i think sent me an uh
[36:15] a note to say
[36:16] you know um you know
[36:19] we love him and
[36:20] and i said i'm sending this to you
[36:21] because i know you love me i wrote it
[36:23] back i said good grief sister the whole
[36:24] world loves brother jim amen he's uh
[36:28] well known around the world because of
[36:30] the ministry there at happy valley
[36:32] and uh brother jim is an awesome awesome
[36:34] awesome man
[36:35] so praise the lord we want to go to
[36:37] prayer about those in just in a moment
[36:40] but we have a missionary work that we're
[36:42] going to do it's a missionary outreach
[36:44] for for those of you who don't know
[36:47] my mom and dad for years had been
[36:51] communicating
[36:52] with uh native tribal people from the
[36:55] cherokee nation up from where my dad was
[36:57] born and raised his whole
[37:00] young manhood and my dad claims
[37:02] which we've never dna tested i don't
[37:05] think but my dad would know his family
[37:07] claimed for years that they had cherokee
[37:10] in their blood and that would make sense
[37:12] historically since
[37:13] my dad's uh the watkins came from the
[37:16] highlands of scotland and when they came
[37:19] ashore in the colonies colonists didn't
[37:21] like them
[37:22] can you imagine not liking somebody like
[37:24] brother eddie
[37:26] they didn't like them and so the
[37:28] the scots just kept going west you know
[37:30] and they settled the appalachian
[37:31] mountains
[37:33] and so that's where my heritage is from
[37:35] and so it wouldn't be unusual at all to
[37:37] have
[37:38] inner marriage there among the cherokee
[37:41] nation there but
[37:43] that that's almost a minor point but
[37:46] compared especially to the point i want
[37:47] to get to momentarily
[37:49] but they have been my dad and it was his
[37:51] heart's desire to see some work start up
[37:54] there and my mom has carried on
[37:56] amen that missionary work amen and she's
[37:59] actually
[38:00] after a long time and it just looked
[38:03] like it was just nothing remaining of
[38:06] any communication
[38:07] and just when she was almost ready to
[38:10] give it up suddenly she gets a
[38:12] communication and they had lost your
[38:14] contact info mom and uh and they wanted
[38:17] more books and so
[38:19] here we go again amen so we're gonna
[38:22] we're actually gonna go up there and
[38:23] it's not the first time it's happened
[38:25] they had some meetings up there
[38:27] uh and but not kind of not with the
[38:30] emphasis that i have on my heart i want
[38:32] to carry on that i don't know about long
[38:35] term carrying it on but i want to
[38:37] fulfill a burning in my heart to go up
[38:39] there and hold some outreach meetings
[38:41] and aiming it at the cherokee nation
[38:44] and my message to them is quite simple
[38:47] you know how how is it that you're
[38:49] unaware
[38:51] cherokee indian nation how is it that
[38:53] you're unaware that a prophet rose up
[38:55] from among your own people and you don't
[38:57] even know about him and i even hear i
[38:59] know about him and you don't know about
[39:01] him and how is it that you don't know
[39:03] it's because the denominations who
[39:05] control you for a hundred years have
[39:07] kept it from you
[39:08] and but but this is this is a prophet
[39:11] whose grandmother came right off the
[39:13] reservation she was full-blooded
[39:15] cherokee and so
[39:17] you know i you know they if they ask me
[39:20] why why did he never
[39:23] come to us i'll say well you never
[39:24] invited him he went to the apaches and
[39:27] many great miracles were done on those
[39:29] reservations and brother branham says
[39:32] quite a bit about in defense of his
[39:35] native countrymen and us particularly
[39:37] the cherokee nation and says that he uh
[39:40] maybe because they're his people
[39:42] and so that's that's just burning in my
[39:44] heart i have how i have a hard time
[39:46] putting it in words it's just burning on
[39:48] my heart
[39:49] um to take to them and say and so we've
[39:52] actually made some contact already
[39:54] there's one brother who's um he's
[39:56] baptist but he's proven to be open to
[39:58] the word and the chief i don't know we
[40:01] don't know but uh we're we're going to
[40:03] go up there
[40:05] september
[40:06] 17th and 19th
[40:09] and uh and on saturday there will be a
[40:12] picnic with a gospel singing followed by
[40:15] a cherokee bonfire that's something they
[40:17] do as a tribal nation there
[40:20] and um a tribal bonfire at the um
[40:24] okinawa fee olive tea i think
[40:28] that
[40:29] ocana lufty thanks sister mom uh park
[40:32] there amen sunday morning we plan to
[40:35] have an outdoor service whether
[40:37] permitting we're going to make a
[40:38] provision if we have to go indoors and
[40:40] so it was on sister jean's heart to also
[40:42] do a clothing drive for the natives
[40:45] native americans there brother branham
[40:47] called them real americans primarily
[40:50] for children and ladies dresses and
[40:53] shoes
[40:54] but will accept all clothing in good
[40:56] condition with no stains and i want to
[40:59] emphasize good clothing don't send the
[41:01] stuff up there that you're ready to send
[41:04] to the landfill and uh you know maybe
[41:07] maybe go out and buy buy something new
[41:09] to send up there but if you've got
[41:11] something in good condition you don't
[41:12] wear it anymore and it's not stained up
[41:14] and not worn out then we'll take it up
[41:17] there and distribute it i don't know
[41:19] friends we might get one shot at this
[41:22] uh by the time i finish preaching
[41:24] because i intend to not pull any punches
[41:26] i intend to just declare openly what god
[41:29] has done in this day and i'm even going
[41:31] to offer to pray for their sick because
[41:32] i'm going to tell you in missionary work
[41:34] around the world in my life
[41:35] i've seen god do a special thing
[41:38] and it's scriptural it is scriptural in
[41:41] antioch the bible said god did special
[41:43] miracles special miracles because it was
[41:46] being introduced there brand new and uh
[41:49] i remember years ago brother lonnie when
[41:51] we were in the mission field there in in
[41:53] the in the russia and the ukraine and
[41:55] belarus and places and it was all brand
[41:57] new because the iron curtain had just
[41:59] collapsed and we were going back in for
[42:01] some of the first time with the message
[42:02] of the hour
[42:03] and
[42:04] brother lonnie said be on beyond be
[42:06] prepared because he said when when
[42:09] something goes into a new area where
[42:10] it's never been and they start receiving
[42:13] it
[42:13] he said god will start doing special
[42:15] things that he wouldn't normally do but
[42:17] he'll do special things and i realized
[42:19] that was scriptural and i've seen that
[42:21] happen
[42:22] i remember meetings there in russia
[42:25] right in moscow when we were taking the
[42:28] gospel there for some of the very first
[42:30] time
[42:31] and i mean i saw blinded eyes opened i
[42:34] saw epileptic children
[42:37] demons cast off of them with just a
[42:38] simple prayer and be completely
[42:41] delivered i saw a tremendous power of
[42:43] god moving i saw people at the preaching
[42:46] of the gospel being healed right while
[42:48] they're not even being prayed for just
[42:49] preaching to them and they were
[42:51] believing standing up healed got the
[42:53] testimonies from the pastor coming after
[42:55] the meeting took me said hey people were
[42:57] this brother this sister over here young
[42:59] people being baptized with the holy
[43:01] ghost right in their seat amen people
[43:03] coming in off the streets and dropping
[43:04] down to the floor surrendering their
[43:06] life to the lord and tremendous
[43:09] deliverance taking place so you know i
[43:12] intend to to put it to the to the
[43:14] challenge not arrogantly but just to say
[43:17] god keeps his word
[43:19] amen and so i i plan to go with great
[43:21] expectation offer to pray for their sick
[43:24] and take them these uh clothing and
[43:26] preach the gospel to them and if we only
[43:28] get one shot at it and we never get
[43:30] invited back then so be it but we did
[43:33] our duty amen and i've i've i feel that
[43:37] i have um you know met that uh
[43:40] continuation and who knows what god
[43:42] could do friends we're close to the end
[43:44] god could do something amazing in the
[43:46] cherokee nation there's never been a
[43:48] church among them there's never been an
[43:50] outbreak of the message and i would know
[43:52] believe me that's where i'm from and my
[43:54] whole family and we've known all that
[43:56] for years and so
[43:57] uh brother eddie always had a desire to
[43:59] see the word of god break out in his old
[44:02] home ground
[44:03] amen so
[44:05] we're going to do that on september
[44:06] 17-19
[44:08] and i'm going to go up at least myself
[44:10] brother george may accompany me and
[44:12] we're going to reconnoiter the
[44:14] recognitor i guess the marines would say
[44:16] do a kind of a recon
[44:18] on the area i want to i want to i
[44:21] actually want to go
[44:22] and and run some ads in the paper and
[44:24] figure out an internet facebook presence
[44:26] maybe some way to get
[44:28] through social media i may even meet
[44:30] maybe even going to have some posters
[44:32] blown up of the of the
[44:35] brother branham there in the houston
[44:36] texas picture with the pillar of fire
[44:37] over his head because that's an
[44:39] inarguable scientifically proven uh
[44:42] supernatural being
[44:44] you notice they even the the ding-dongs
[44:47] who try to argue over everything else
[44:48] don't argue that because they can't
[44:50] because it's right i've been in
[44:51] washington dc i've seen it and uh and
[44:54] you have to actually get special
[44:55] arrangements to see it because it's part
[44:57] of the
[44:58] national archive and so they've proven
[45:00] that that was a supernatural being
[45:03] amen so
[45:04] so we're going to use that one
[45:06] and uh and and be able to say some
[45:09] things very directly about what god has
[45:11] done in this hour amen so just have that
[45:14] on your mind and um
[45:16] and if you uh please see as far as
[45:18] clothing see sister jean or brother
[45:21] george or sister andrea with your
[45:23] donations
[45:24] and
[45:25] and we're gonna we'll make sure that
[45:26] those get all up there and if you want
[45:28] to come along come along uh but if we
[45:30] only have a handful that'll be fine too
[45:32] so september 17
[45:34] and 19. amen let's stand and go to
[45:37] prayer
[45:38] for brother donald and sister elaine and
[45:40] my wife's
[45:41] uh kids sister sherry
[45:44] amen and just believe that the lord
[45:47] will move on the scene and we'll uh get
[45:50] ready to turn to the word just uh give
[45:52] me some
[45:52] of course sister deborah of your
[45:54] choosing let's bow our heads father
[45:58] we thank you for your word

[46:02] living god
[46:04] lord now

[46:39] things sovereignly and there no one's
[46:41] going to stop your hand or stay your
[46:42] hand that's not it that's not even my
[46:44] business
[46:45] my business is to not let the devil do
[46:47] something and get away with it because
[46:49] he's a straight up trespasser lord he
[46:52] has no rights and you said i would that
[46:54] you be in health so father when a man

[47:03] consistently you were always willing you
[47:05] said i will be thou hold it was always
[47:08] your will for your children to receive

[47:17] jesus christ and may with that they be
[47:20] well we call for their deliverance lord

[47:36] be made well and that you spare her at
[47:38] this hour we commit ourselves into your
[47:41] hands lord
[47:42] that you've seen the the burden that's
[47:45] upon my heart today lord coming to this
[47:48] service and it's been a busy day of
[47:50] preaching and teaching since early
[47:52] morning hours lord this now my third
[47:55] time to open the word today and father i
[47:58] i i'm asking for
[48:00] you lord to take and open the word and
[48:03] break it to us many things i could say
[48:05] plenty of notes laying before me but i i
[48:09] just feel in my heart lord that i i
[48:11] don't want to put you in a box i want to
[48:14] try to get to the burden of the word for
[48:16] the people that's on my heart now
[48:18] clarify that lord make it crystal clear
[48:21] and father give us the path to take this
[48:23] morning we commit ourselves we humble
[48:26] ourselves before you in jesus name
[48:28] committing it all to you in jesus name
[48:30] amen amen praise the lord friends god
[48:33] bless you this morning
[48:34] we're going to turn
[48:36] to
[48:37] revelation chapter 7
[48:40] this morning revelation
[48:42] chapter
[48:43] 7.
[48:45] and we've
[48:47] looking as as we said to you this
[48:50] morning on the church-wide
[48:52] notice board the chat board i want to
[48:55] take a title this morning world
[48:57] transitioning
[48:58] under the sixth seal
[49:01] and i i want to strive today
[49:04] to take a very something that's been
[49:07] very profound to me and bring you up to
[49:09] speed on where we're at and what we're
[49:12] doing i think that it is paramount that
[49:14] we see god clearly what he's doing right
[49:17] now
[49:18] not even what he's doing last month what
[49:20] he's doing right now
[49:21] and
[49:22] amen and so
[49:24] we want to see that make that very clear
[49:28] incidentally before we read i meant to
[49:32] make a follow-up comment and i'll just
[49:34] do that just now
[49:35] brother matt was speaking to you and
[49:37] kind of updating you here last weekend
[49:40] while we were in louisiana
[49:42] concerning the building project i'm sure
[49:43] you can see the hard work that's been
[49:45] done i love the effect of these larger
[49:47] windows and so we've got a lot we're
[49:51] still doing outside to the church to the
[49:53] fellowship hall to the front we're still
[49:56] those doors they're going to be replaced
[49:58] or are upgraded to some in some way and
[50:01] we've also got plans for the inside here
[50:03] we want to
[50:05] um take out this ceiling and raise it
[50:07] and vault it up and have exposed beams
[50:09] and uh change the a lot of things that
[50:12] we're transitioning through
[50:14] um for over the next you know into the
[50:17] fall probably take us so what we're
[50:19] going to do is
[50:21] is we're going to
[50:22] put a special link uh we don't have it
[50:25] today it's not up it might be up later
[50:27] tonight but we're going to put a special
[50:30] uh link i know most of you use paypal
[50:33] already sending in tizen offerings and
[50:34] missions and youth and things like that
[50:37] but we're going to put a special link on
[50:39] the on our homepage for our building
[50:42] fund so that it's easy peasy you can
[50:45] click straight on that make a donation
[50:47] and because it comes through that link
[50:49] it will automatically go in the building
[50:51] fund
[50:52] so it's a really streamlined uh for the
[50:55] church books and that way it's uh you
[50:57] don't have to worry about labeling it so
[50:59] use that link and that's where it goes
[51:02] and so
[51:03] we
[51:03] we hope that you can see what's going on
[51:06] and become a little excited
[51:08] about what we want to do going forward
[51:10] and we'll have more to say on that in
[51:12] coming weeks and months amen but we sure
[51:15] are happy for the progress we won't have
[51:17] any work going on here
[51:20] this week i will pick up again and
[51:22] resume the following week
[51:24] amen so let's look at our scripture in
[51:27] revelation chapter seven and we're
[51:29] taking this title
[51:31] world transitioning under the sixth seal
[51:35] and after these things i saw four angels
[51:38] standing on the four corners of the
[51:40] earth holding the four winds of the
[51:42] earth that the wind should not blow on
[51:44] the earth nor on the sea
[51:46] nor on any tree
[51:48] and i saw another angel ascending from
[51:50] the east
[51:51] having the seal of the living god and he
[51:54] cried with a loud voice to the four
[51:56] angels to whom it was given
[51:59] excuse me
[52:01] to hurt
[52:02] the earth and the sea saying
[52:06] hurt not the earth neither does neither
[52:08] the sea nor the trees till we have
[52:11] sealed the servants of our god in their
[52:14] foreheads and i heard the number of them
[52:18] which were sealed and there were sealed
[52:20] a hundred and forty and four thousand of
[52:24] all the tribes of the children of israel
[52:27] and from there he goes down naming the
[52:30] twelve tribes amen we won't need to
[52:34] read that let's pray father we thank you
[52:37] for your word now blessed in jesus name
[52:40] amen god bless you can be seated
[52:46] amen
[52:56] when last we
[52:57] were ministering we ministered about
[53:00] changing times and
[53:03] we talked about you know the tendency
[53:07] of stagnation to come into people's
[53:10] lives and
[53:11] that is exceptionally deadly i i could
[53:14] almost not overstate to you
[53:17] the importance of not be not allowing
[53:21] your life to become
[53:23] like a stagnant pool of water we made
[53:26] the statement and of course it's
[53:27] scripture we understand clearly that you
[53:30] say well still still water runs deep and
[53:33] david said though i walk through the
[53:35] valley of the shadow of death and he
[53:37] leadeth me besides still waters we get
[53:39] that but but that scriptural still water
[53:43] is deep water that's being
[53:46] surfaced by an
[53:48] active artesian well underneath it so
[53:51] it's not a stagnant pond you understand
[53:54] it's being fed and it and it has a
[53:56] current and it has a flow it might be
[53:59] still
[54:00] sometimes it can be rolling quite a lot
[54:02] depending on what rains have happened in
[54:05] the mountains and it comes down and
[54:06] fills up the underground aquifers and
[54:08] then sometimes you can find an artesian
[54:11] as brother branham described his
[54:12] artesian well and called it bubbling or
[54:15] rolling or churning and then there's
[54:17] times where even that artesian well i've
[54:20] been there and there's times where it's
[54:21] very still yet you can still see a flow
[54:24] you can still see that it's not a
[54:26] stagnant pond and it's very cold water
[54:29] coming from deep within the earth and
[54:31] irrigating the farmlands out and about
[54:34] so
[54:35] you don't want to become
[54:37] a stagnation we realize that that that's
[54:40] not uh you know what god has for his
[54:45] family and so we realized then that that
[54:48] that while there are
[54:50] life forms i remember making this
[54:52] statement last time while there are
[54:55] life forms nature finds a way i mean
[54:58] it's amazing where nature has life
[55:00] living and thr and and even in stagnant
[55:02] ponds there's different kinds of life
[55:05] form i grant that but my point is that
[55:08] that's not the believer that's not where
[55:11] you're supposed to live that's not an
[55:12] environment you're supposed to live in
[55:15] you're supposed to
[55:16] live like you know that seven colored
[55:19] rainbow trout
[55:20] that that guy needs fresh moving water
[55:23] and eagles need high soaring altitudes
[55:26] and i'm here to tell you something
[55:27] friends don't let the devil plague you
[55:30] down with stuff
[55:32] wait your mind down we were talking
[55:34] about in the sunday school class this
[55:36] morning about you know uh everything
[55:39] everything that we touch and this is
[55:41] such an important point to make
[55:43] especially to young people people and
[55:46] young men i'm not just talking about
[55:47] little small teenagers i'm talking about
[55:49] young men and young women you know our
[55:52] upper teens early 20s mid 20s making
[55:54] their plans setting their pathway for
[55:58] life and and naturally we there's
[56:00] nothing wrong with education or career
[56:03] or or you know
[56:05] providing for your needs and and pay
[56:07] paying bills and having a family of
[56:09] course we have all of these things paul
[56:11] said that we can't go out of the world
[56:13] we do live here we do need to make
[56:15] provision and there's nothing wrong in
[56:16] that but just so that you understand
[56:20] who's in control of all of that stuff
[56:22] that's the real key
[56:24] is that we understand that it's all part
[56:27] of satan's eden and and as such
[56:30] satan has it designed i promise you he
[56:33] has it designed to draw away draw away
[56:38] your mind and your heart uh unto worldly
[56:42] things and i don't just mean sinful
[56:44] things i mean just the pursuit of
[56:46] education the pursuit of a career the
[56:48] pursuit of wealth the pursuit of
[56:49] happiness say i need to be happy sure
[56:51] fine be happy but understand that you
[56:54] have a thirst given to you by god and
[56:57] that thirst is only ever going to be
[56:58] really satisfied here
[57:02] that that that trying to find your
[57:04] satisfaction in life by chasing a better
[57:07] career or higher education or a bigger
[57:10] bank account that is an exercise in
[57:13] futility
[57:14] i wish i had it here this morning i well
[57:17] i probably wouldn't show it but i
[57:18] thought about using it for uh a youth
[57:21] meeting coming up and and it's not hard
[57:23] to find that there there have there i i
[57:26] was looking at uh i don't know who made
[57:28] it some christian organization and they
[57:30] just went on the streets and they they
[57:33] they kind of had access to some of the
[57:36] uh the most uh renowned hollywood stars
[57:39] and sports stars i'd start naming them
[57:42] you'd recognize them and and and
[57:45] political uh and wealthy people and i
[57:48] mean the these are the people who are on
[57:49] the red carpets who roll up in the
[57:51] bentleys who you know who have
[57:53] multi-million dollar contracts for
[57:54] bouncing a basketball or catching
[57:56] something in the end zone and they and
[57:58] they went around interviewing they must
[58:00] have interviewed 50 of them top pop
[58:02] singers and rap singers and some of the
[58:05] world's what they call elite and they
[58:07] just had a simple question for them just
[58:09] a very simple straightforward question
[58:11] said can money give you happiness
[58:14] and you can see
[58:16] the pop star the rap star the sports
[58:18] star the movie star the the the
[58:20] political star they're almost taken back
[58:22] by the question but somehow they're able
[58:24] to get an honest response
[58:26] and every one of them to a man or a
[58:28] woman not one of them
[58:30] said oh sure money can buy you happiness
[58:34] they all
[58:35] uniformly thought and reflected for a
[58:37] moment and said no
[58:40] what about your fame no
[58:42] it can't it can't get you happiness
[58:44] no it can't and they were just all
[58:46] honest here's the people they're the
[58:48] elite they've got everything that
[58:50] everybody's chasing
[58:51] and they're looking at a camera saying
[58:54] no
[58:55] it can't it can't bring happiness
[58:57] one of them was honest enough to say
[58:59] money can buy you pleasures
[59:01] but happiness no are you happy not
[59:04] always
[59:05] see and so you have to understand
[59:08] friends sometimes it's necessary
[59:11] for the word of god to pull the veil
[59:14] away that satan tries to veil your eyes
[59:16] and cover your
[59:18] perspective i remember years ago in the
[59:21] 1970s and 80s oh my the the the marlboro
[59:26] man on the bo on the billboards now
[59:28] thankfully they've limited a lot of
[59:30] those cigarette ads they can't do them
[59:32] like they used to anymore but back in
[59:34] the day when i was a teenager my every
[59:36] every guy that was like the coolest dude

[59:44] he just looked tough he just looked
[59:46] strong and but and and those posters
[59:49] were in magazines and on the streets and
[59:53] on television and when they could do
[59:55] those kinds of ad on television but what
[59:57] they
[59:58] never showed to this day you won't find
[1:00:01] any ads of that man in that picture
[1:00:06] laying in a hospital bed skin and bones
[1:00:09] stage four lung cancer
[1:00:12] wasted away till he just looked like a
[1:00:14] skeleton of a man and died in agony
[1:00:18] they'll show you these models and
[1:00:20] they'll put them up there and all their
[1:00:21] beauty and their max factor and it's all
[1:00:23] fake anyway and and and that but they
[1:00:26] what they'll never show you
[1:00:28] sister is that same exact model years
[1:00:32] later when her health is gone and her
[1:00:34] youth is gone and her she's broken down
[1:00:36] and alone and and and and tragic and
[1:00:39] taking their own life and committing
[1:00:41] suicide i'm here to tell you there is no
[1:00:44] contentment possible outside of god's
[1:00:47] word
[1:00:48] and the world is in such a
[1:00:51] a state of collapse and and catastrophe
[1:00:55] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:00:57] when when the lord descended from heaven
[1:01:00] and brought an open book to a prophet
[1:01:03] the mighty angel christ he found the
[1:01:06] earth in a catastrophe you are living in
[1:01:09] that hour where where brother branham i
[1:01:11] was showing the sunday school class this
[1:01:13] morning all civilizations of the devil
[1:01:16] he runs it all all education all science
[1:01:18] all politics social issues whatever it
[1:01:22] is i just just know this that satan is
[1:01:25] at the helm of it and they asked brother
[1:01:26] branham will we have that that this kind
[1:01:29] of a civilization in heaven he says no
[1:01:31] but we will have a civilization but
[1:01:34] it'll be so far above this civilization
[1:01:36] friends don't don't miss heaven for the
[1:01:39] world
[1:01:41] i wouldn't miss heaven for the world
[1:01:43] would you
[1:01:44] amen i'm here to tell you something
[1:01:46] friends god offers us a bright future
[1:01:50] and and the world is transitioning
[1:01:53] nature is transitioning i made this
[1:01:55] statement last time i want to make it
[1:01:57] again
[1:01:58] that that catastrophic change people who
[1:02:00] don't like change i'm here to tell you
[1:02:03] catastrophic change is rushing to meet
[1:02:05] us
[1:02:07] and the only path for the believer is up
[1:02:11] that's the only path sometimes we find
[1:02:14] ourselves
[1:02:16] more inclined or at least let me say it
[1:02:19] is my hope or let me say we need to be
[1:02:22] finding ourselves more inclined to up
[1:02:26] amen i'm not looking so much to go
[1:02:29] forward with career and education
[1:02:33] fortune and glory
[1:02:34] fortune and fame i'm looking to go up
[1:02:37] hallelujah i've set my destination i
[1:02:40] know that i am one upon whom the ends of
[1:02:42] the world have come and brother branham
[1:02:45] made that challenge
[1:02:47] there into whom would we go what a
[1:02:49] question to what a title for a sermon to
[1:02:51] whom would we go what a what a
[1:02:53] paralyzing question i think sometimes
[1:02:56] you know brother branham i remember
[1:02:58] brother eddie told me years ago that he
[1:03:00] was walking through the living room and
[1:03:02] and just you know i don't know on his
[1:03:04] way to the coffee maker or wherever and
[1:03:06] he said he just walked by and looked
[1:03:07] down as he's walking by and there was a
[1:03:09] book what shall i do with jesus called
[1:03:11] the christ and he said it literally just
[1:03:13] turned him and he said oh whoa whoa whoa
[1:03:15] wait a minute
[1:03:17] what shall i do whoa wait a minute he
[1:03:19] picked it up and suddenly it was more
[1:03:21] than a title
[1:03:22] the lord was saying
[1:03:24] now ask yourself what shall i know what
[1:03:28] brother branham did with him
[1:03:30] i know what the apostles did i know what
[1:03:33] pilate did
[1:03:35] i know what the jews did that's not in
[1:03:37] question but what shall i do with jesus
[1:03:42] called the christ
[1:03:43] there's a question that you need to ask
[1:03:46] yourself today what shall i do because
[1:03:49] brother branham said his blood is on
[1:03:52] your hands
[1:03:54] and i'm here to tell you the world is
[1:03:56] passing away and nobody can stop it
[1:03:59] and a rapture is coming and nothing can
[1:04:01] stop it and a people are leaving and
[1:04:03] nothing can stop it hallelujah and
[1:04:05] people are going to die and nothing can
[1:04:07] stop it the world is being destroyed
[1:04:09] it's transitioning and nothing can stop
[1:04:11] it it's irreversible
[1:04:13] it's irrevocable nobody's going to undo
[1:04:16] that i'm here to tell you catastrophic
[1:04:19] change is rushing to meet you
[1:04:23] make whatever plans you want but
[1:04:25] catastrophic change is rushing to meet
[1:04:28] us
[1:04:30] what are your plans for that
[1:04:32] brother branham talked about christ
[1:04:34] being the eternal achievement i'm sure
[1:04:36] you remember from last time he is the
[1:04:38] eternal achievement there is no other
[1:04:41] place you could go or anything you could
[1:04:43] do that you could achieve that would be
[1:04:46] everlasting outside of jesus christ
[1:04:49] we find that
[1:04:51] you know this message is astonishing in
[1:04:54] that
[1:04:55] you know when you when you realize what
[1:04:57] god has opened up to us in his word
[1:05:01] do you realize how privileged you are to
[1:05:02] understand
[1:05:04] that
[1:05:05] the world by and large looks at the
[1:05:09] seven seals and the four horsemen and
[1:05:12] all of these things and oh wow the
[1:05:14] antichrist and the four horsemen and the
[1:05:16] false prophet and the seals and it's all
[1:05:18] coming and we need to be ready and and
[1:05:21] here's a prophet who comes out of a
[1:05:22] little room from that pillar of fire the
[1:05:25] same one over his head in houston texas
[1:05:27] and he comes to the pulp and he says
[1:05:28] actually it's already in the past first
[1:05:30] seal's history what about the second one
[1:05:32] history
[1:05:33] what the third one history
[1:05:35] you know it's already happened without
[1:05:36] the first trumpet history second history
[1:05:39] third history fourth recent history
[1:05:42] fifth yeah
[1:05:44] six oh yeah
[1:05:45] seventh you better believe it
[1:05:47] fourth seal you're living in it right
[1:05:49] now
[1:05:50] see you're living in the fourth under
[1:05:53] the fourth seal with a seventh seal
[1:05:55] message
[1:05:56] because what was the seventh seal
[1:05:58] message it was the unveiling of the
[1:06:00] mighty god
[1:06:01] and when he and when god was unsealed it
[1:06:04] unsealed his family it unsealed you did
[1:06:06] you know you had a seal on your life
[1:06:08] that the holy ghost had to unseal you
[1:06:11] to give you the kind of life that god
[1:06:13] saw that's the life i want i want the
[1:06:16] life my constant prayer for me for my
[1:06:18] family for you for your family lord
[1:06:21] bring us closer today this day bring me
[1:06:25] a little closer to the image that you
[1:06:28] saw of me before the foundation of the
[1:06:30] world that doesn't happen by accident
[1:06:33] that's something that has to be purposed
[1:06:35] in your life you have to pursue that
[1:06:38] we're saying to the sunday school class
[1:06:39] this morning you have to roll up your
[1:06:41] sleeves you have to gear up your mind
[1:06:43] you have to gird up your loins you have
[1:06:46] to get ready because a grace was
[1:06:48] prophesied to come but you have to be
[1:06:50] ready to receive it
[1:06:55] this isn't disney world
[1:06:57] this isn't you know santa claus this
[1:06:59] isn't somebody just giving you a gift
[1:07:02] this is god giving you an opportunity
[1:07:05] what are you gonna do with the message
[1:07:07] of the seventh seal i'm here to tell you
[1:07:09] that it's not just about mysteries
[1:07:12] people you know people look i i remember
[1:07:15] you know when you talk when you talk
[1:07:16] about the sixth seal and and any student
[1:07:19] of the message would go yeah the six
[1:07:21] seals tribulation
[1:07:23] and you you almost find yourself i
[1:07:25] remember a preacher years ago preaching
[1:07:27] and at the time i was a young man didn't
[1:07:29] fully understand what he meant by it i
[1:07:31] do now
[1:07:32] but he said you know he said some people
[1:07:34] say oh the six what's sixth seal said oh
[1:07:36] it's a tribulation he said where'd you
[1:07:38] get that
[1:07:39] and even when i heard that i went uh
[1:07:41] brother branham maybe
[1:07:43] not in the the six seals tribulation
[1:07:45] period but the sixth seal is so much
[1:07:47] more than that
[1:07:48] the sixth seal is a whole chain of
[1:07:50] events that's happening we read today
[1:07:52] about how that during the tribulation
[1:07:55] period 144 000 jews are called and
[1:07:58] they're part of the elect family you
[1:08:00] know how that happens you know why that
[1:08:02] happens because the message of the
[1:08:05] seventh seal under an eagle anointing
[1:08:08] when you leave here that eagle anointing
[1:08:10] lifts up and flies east and picks up two
[1:08:13] more prophets
[1:08:14] picks up moses and elijah and takes this
[1:08:16] very message that you believe and that
[1:08:19] the world scorns and takes this very
[1:08:21] message to 144 000 elected hebrews who
[1:08:25] are true hebrews they receive it they
[1:08:27] become believers they
[1:08:29] they they have suddenly they have they
[1:08:31] go from having a jewish synagogue to a
[1:08:33] message church
[1:08:35] hallelujah and the power of god breaks
[1:08:38] upon them and those prophets and and
[1:08:40] they they have control over nature and
[1:08:41] the world hates them see that's what i
[1:08:44] say i thought they're the trumpet was to
[1:08:45] the jews sure the trump the trumpets
[1:08:48] gather the jews but that that's just a
[1:08:50] gathering trumpet but the message that
[1:08:52] they receive the message they receive is
[1:08:55] the mighty god unveiled they find out
[1:08:58] that jehovah of the old testament is
[1:09:01] jesus of the new
[1:09:03] and that you know what that revelation
[1:09:05] does to them it puts the seal of god in
[1:09:09] their forehead and the bible says that's
[1:09:12] how you're sealed the only one who can
[1:09:14] seal is the holy ghost
[1:09:16] amen and so what how did you get sealed
[1:09:18] because the holy ghost unveiled himself
[1:09:21] to you and interpreted his word to you
[1:09:24] and you became a believer and you're
[1:09:26] sealed into the kingdom
[1:09:28] you're escaping destruction the 144
[1:09:31] thousand die as martyrs they have to
[1:09:33] because of the purging of israel
[1:09:36] so great is this message we were showing
[1:09:39] this morning i don't mean to keep just
[1:09:41] rehearsing points we made in sunday
[1:09:42] school but although it's very relevant
[1:09:45] but we were rehearsing how that brother
[1:09:47] branham says there's a remnant in every
[1:09:49] age
[1:09:50] all the way back to the old testament
[1:09:52] and you find that because i don't have
[1:09:54] time to teach on it this morning i was
[1:09:55] teaching on it on my
[1:09:57] uh bible study uh call-in show this
[1:09:59] morning early this morning
[1:10:01] and and just breaking that down for
[1:10:03] those brothers
[1:10:04] but if you if you go back
[1:10:06] and you look at
[1:10:08] uh
[1:10:09] this passage in chapter 7
[1:10:12] of revelation you find dan and ephraim
[1:10:16] missing
[1:10:17] and why why were they missing because
[1:10:19] their names were blotted out as a tribe
[1:10:21] blotted out from under heaven brother
[1:10:22] branham brings that out in the sixth
[1:10:24] seal their names are blotted out why
[1:10:26] because of idolatry
[1:10:28] because they didn't heed the message of
[1:10:31] their prophets starting with moses
[1:10:34] and they just kept they kept into
[1:10:35] idolatry and there's where jeroboam
[1:10:38] remember the kingdom divided and
[1:10:39] jeroboam took 10 tribes and and and
[1:10:42] and and then here you have rehoboam the
[1:10:44] son of solomon who keeps two tribes and
[1:10:47] and and to keep the people from coming
[1:10:50] to jerusalem to worship jeroboam says
[1:10:53] okay i will build calves and i'll put
[1:10:56] them one in den and i'll put one over
[1:10:57] here
[1:10:58] and and he was jeroboam was actually in
[1:11:00] ephraim and he's going to put one there
[1:11:02] and one in dan and he says now it's too
[1:11:05] hard for you
[1:11:07] to go life's too busy
[1:11:12] you got too much on your plate you know
[1:11:14] you got children in school and careers
[1:11:16] you can't always i mean going to church
[1:11:18] needs to be as easy as we can make it
[1:11:20] okay and if there's any struggle at all
[1:11:21] just don't worry about it we've got an
[1:11:23] alternative way you can go and you know
[1:11:26] you know what that was a perfect type of
[1:11:27] what would happen in the new testament
[1:11:29] the bible says they would heed to
[1:11:30] themselves teachers having itching ears
[1:11:32] who would tell them what they wanted to
[1:11:33] hear
[1:11:34] people believe what they want to believe
[1:11:37] and when a false king come along telling
[1:11:39] them you don't need you don't need to
[1:11:41] assemble yourselves as you see the day
[1:11:43] approaching come on you can just go to
[1:11:44] church on the internet it won't matter
[1:11:49] amen i'm gonna keep going it regardless
[1:11:52] you might as well say a man old me jump
[1:11:55] up walk out run out gay man give me an
[1:11:56] amen or something amen
[1:11:58] but it's true that those types paul said
[1:12:01] those are for our examples
[1:12:03] well i shouldn't i shouldn't go back
[1:12:04] there and pull that out it's for our
[1:12:05] examples
[1:12:07] see they they gave them a a convenient
[1:12:10] gospel and because those people wanted a
[1:12:12] convenient gospel
[1:12:13] people want that today they want a
[1:12:15] convenient gospel they don't really want
[1:12:16] to change their lives they don't want
[1:12:19] the gospel they don't mind the idea of
[1:12:21] christianity but don't make it impact my
[1:12:23] life in any way
[1:12:24] i just want to hold up a sign that says
[1:12:26] i'm a methodist baptist presbyterian i'm
[1:12:28] part of a club
[1:12:30] you know and i'm going to tell you
[1:12:31] something friends here here's something
[1:12:33] that i have come to believe more and
[1:12:36] more and more to it's becoming in me
[1:12:39] almost uh
[1:12:41] a burning to to say
[1:12:43] and i get we still witness with wisdom
[1:12:47] always use wisdom always be prayerful
[1:12:49] there are some times this might shock
[1:12:51] you there are some people say i need to
[1:12:52] go witness to him and god might not want
[1:12:54] you to do that at all
[1:12:56] not at all be led the sons of god are
[1:12:59] led by the spirit of god a lot of times
[1:13:02] jesus had opportunities to set the
[1:13:04] record straight and he's walked off yeah
[1:13:06] they even even could have corrected
[1:13:08] their errors a very simple error about
[1:13:10] his about his about where he was born
[1:13:12] and they're standing there and here's
[1:13:13] they're deciding
[1:13:15] their soul
[1:13:17] the fate of their soul
[1:13:19] whether they're going to have eternal
[1:13:21] life or be destroyed you'd say what
[1:13:23] could be more important than that and
[1:13:24] it's all hinging on he can't be the
[1:13:27] messiah because the scriptures say you
[1:13:29] know that he he's born in bethlehem and
[1:13:32] uh we know that this man's from galilee
[1:13:34] so no he can't be
[1:13:36] and jesus standing there could have
[1:13:37] swept well
[1:13:39] okay here listen here's my card
[1:13:41] actually i was there was a you're just
[1:13:44] misunderstanding i actually was born in
[1:13:46] bethlehem but then the king tried to
[1:13:47] kill me so my daddy took me to egypt and
[1:13:49] i came back to
[1:13:50] you know in the galilean but actually
[1:13:52] was born in bethlehem he could he could
[1:13:53] have fixed that
[1:13:55] he could have fixed that you know what
[1:13:56] he just he just let him think it and
[1:13:59] walked away
[1:14:01] you know why because he only did that
[1:14:03] which the father showed him to do
[1:14:06] but i'm going to tell you something
[1:14:07] friends it with wisdom i think that that
[1:14:11] one of the things that that becomes is
[1:14:13] becoming more and more incumbent upon me
[1:14:16] at least maybe it's just me feeling it
[1:14:17] if you want to adopt it fine
[1:14:19] but i'm to the point to where
[1:14:21] here i'm in possession
[1:14:24] of one of the greatest mystery secrets
[1:14:26] that the world is completely blind to
[1:14:30] and are going to get blindsided by and i
[1:14:32] happen to know the answer
[1:14:35] that denominationalism
[1:14:37] will lead you to the mark of the beast
[1:14:39] and doom you and i happen to know that
[1:14:42] by the bible
[1:14:43] and i've got people who you witness to
[1:14:45] and say are you a christian oh yeah i'm
[1:14:47] a methodist oh i'm a baptist i'm
[1:14:48] president i'm episcopal i'm this i'm
[1:14:50] catholic i'm whatever and how is it that
[1:14:53] that i mean surely
[1:14:55] at that moment to say
[1:14:58] friend

[1:17:12] god and not just i almost couldn't take
[1:17:15] it it's so glorious and especially when
[1:17:16] it comes down to you and say oh it must
[1:17:18] be a terrible it's the end of the world

[1:17:36] here to give you the gospel the good
[1:17:38] news
[1:17:40] see it and and and that you're you're in
[1:17:42] a denomination it's not good news
[1:17:46] that you are mistakenly thinking you're
[1:17:48] okay mistakingly thinking you're a
[1:17:51] christian when according to the bible i
[1:17:52] know you're not that's not good
[1:17:55] and and and i need to give you the good
[1:17:58] news of the real gospel that it can
[1:18:01] change your life and it has power in the
[1:18:03] blood and it has authority over demons
[1:18:06] and it has it sets up leadership in
[1:18:08] homes and it restores marriages and
[1:18:10] saves young people raises the dead heals
[1:18:12] the sick this is the gospel we believe
[1:18:15] today
[1:18:16] this is the gospel i defend and
[1:18:18] challenge the world to say how
[1:18:21] show me where we're not doing the very
[1:18:23] works of jesus christ that's what it
[1:18:26] came for
[1:18:28] that's what it's to accomplish
[1:18:31] brother branham made us such a statement
[1:18:33] and boy my time is zooming by
[1:18:36] uh
[1:18:37] so i want to
[1:18:38] in case i don't get to it let me get you
[1:18:40] these couple of quotes here in case i
[1:18:42] miss them
[1:18:43] brother branham says in the way back
[1:18:46] i love this and this is relevant today
[1:18:49] because we're
[1:18:50] you know with covet and vaccine the
[1:18:52] whole question vaccine question
[1:18:54] and brother branham says the way back
[1:18:57] he says now
[1:18:59] we find out
[1:19:01] that when a man tries to find a serum a
[1:19:03] doctor
[1:19:04] you know
[1:19:06] to to to give to his patient to
[1:19:08] inoculate him
[1:19:10] you know don't don't think of
[1:19:13] the doctor in your doctors think of
[1:19:15] sister ruth like what her career is
[1:19:17] these these research
[1:19:19] doctors
[1:19:20] and and and to she and so he says to
[1:19:24] give his patient
[1:19:25] a serum to inoculate him from sickness
[1:19:28] he first tries it on a guinea pig and
[1:19:30] see if it'll work but god didn't do that
[1:19:33] see he never took a guinea pig he used
[1:19:35] it on himself
[1:19:36] see a good doctor wants to try a serum
[1:19:38] if he don't know whether it'll kill or
[1:19:40] cure he ought to take it himself first
[1:19:42] see if he don't know if it's going to
[1:19:43] kill somebody
[1:19:44] uh well don't give it to somebody and if
[1:19:46] you if you don't know if it's going to
[1:19:47] kill them take it yourself and see if
[1:19:48] you're a real doctor see if you're that
[1:19:50] determined see and so he says
[1:19:53] and uh before he puts it in somebody
[1:19:56] else and god
[1:19:58] in order to take this serum had to be
[1:20:00] made flesh and dwell among us a kinsmen
[1:20:03] redeemer god had to become a man so he
[1:20:06] could take the serum and he had to love
[1:20:09] this he had his inoculation at jordan
[1:20:14] now you remember when he come to jordan
[1:20:16] that's where he received the holy ghost
[1:20:18] now not for the new birth he didn't he
[1:20:19] wasn't born in sin but to empower his
[1:20:22] ministry okay he didn't need it like you
[1:20:23] needed you need it for empowerment and
[1:20:26] for a new birth to have your nature
[1:20:27] change he didn't need it for that reason
[1:20:29] but it's it's to empower his ministry to
[1:20:31] legitimize his ministry because that's
[1:20:34] that's he's the prototype for a brand
[1:20:36] new kind of person
[1:20:38] you understand jesus is the beginning of
[1:20:41] the creation of god he's a brand new
[1:20:44] kind of person
[1:20:45] he's the prototype for the whole family
[1:20:47] coming after him there will come a day
[1:20:49] he said i'll take away that stony heart
[1:20:51] that law on tables of stone no no no
[1:20:53] we're gonna i'm gonna go down into your
[1:20:54] heart and take out that fallen nature
[1:20:56] and i'm gonna give you a heart of flesh
[1:20:58] and i'm gonna cause you to keep my
[1:20:59] statutes oh i'm so glad he has that kind
[1:21:02] of power to change my desires yeah i
[1:21:05] still fight in the flesh sure i still
[1:21:07] struggle sure i still stumble but i also
[1:21:10] get back up
[1:21:11] after i go to prayer i get back up and i
[1:21:14] go forward again and guess what happens
[1:21:16] if he knocks me down again tomorrow i i
[1:21:18] go to prayer and then i get back up
[1:21:20] again we read a quote here to the class
[1:21:22] this morning that because of what god
[1:21:25] done god forgets your sin as though you
[1:21:27] never did it in the first place
[1:21:31] say why would god forget my sin because
[1:21:34] i said i said you know people believe
[1:21:36] what they want to believe
[1:21:38] everybody knows that people believe what
[1:21:40] they want to even tell them what they
[1:21:41] want to believe they'll believe it
[1:21:43] and man that's how con men work they
[1:21:45] figure out what the person wants and
[1:21:46] they tell them a lie
[1:21:48] say
[1:21:50] why does why does god do that
[1:21:52] god forgets what he wants to forget
[1:21:55] and he looks at the stumblings of my
[1:21:57] life and i desire to forget it he
[1:21:59] desires to forget it i confess it to him
[1:22:02] he forgives it it's gone from his memory
[1:22:05] never to be held against me anymore i'm
[1:22:07] completely free
[1:22:09] oh i do you avail yourselves of his new
[1:22:12] mercies every morning friends do you
[1:22:13] know that every morning
[1:22:15] every morning his mercies are brand new
[1:22:19] you can just
[1:22:20] roll around in it the next day
[1:22:22] hallelujah if the first if the previous
[1:22:24] night didn't turn out so good don't
[1:22:26] worry
[1:22:27] joy comes in the morning
[1:22:29] hallelujah
[1:22:31] oh i'm so glad and brother branham said
[1:22:34] he says now he had his inoculation at
[1:22:36] jordan when he walked out in the river
[1:22:39] by john was baptized and then the
[1:22:40] inoculation come down the toxin fell
[1:22:42] from heaven i like that one the toxin
[1:22:45] fell from heaven
[1:22:46] sister ruth wouldn't normally think of
[1:22:48] toxin as being a good thing but if it's
[1:22:49] a heavenly toxin amen the toxin fell
[1:22:53] from heaven like a dove
[1:22:55] saying this is my beloved son in whom
[1:22:57] i'm pleased to dwell he was inoculated
[1:23:00] now watch watch this he was inoculated
[1:23:02] but now watch before you jump up and
[1:23:04] shout
[1:23:05] and immediately
[1:23:08] after the inoculation
[1:23:10] come the test
[1:23:12] and every man he immediately went into
[1:23:14] the wilderness and was tested and
[1:23:15] tempted and every man as soon as you
[1:23:17] receive the holy ghost and become
[1:23:19] inoculated every demon out of hell will
[1:23:23] turn against you that's quite a bit
[1:23:25] every demon out of hell will turn we're
[1:23:28] not talking about the 200 million
[1:23:30] at euphrates we're talking about every
[1:23:32] demon out of hell say who hates me a
[1:23:36] bunch
[1:23:38] every demon out of hell will turn
[1:23:42] against you even your own family
[1:23:44] sometimes will turn you down your
[1:23:46] husband your wife your pastor you're
[1:23:49] kicked out of a church you're laughed at
[1:23:51] and made fun of it's the test see
[1:23:54] but he goes on to say
[1:23:56] the inoculation
[1:23:58] held
[1:23:59] and that and i want to tell you
[1:24:00] something friends that inoculation held
[1:24:03] all the way to calvary
[1:24:06] there was no test
[1:24:07] however severe that could upend him why
[1:24:11] because he was inoculated
[1:24:13] the scripture had said
[1:24:15] i have come to do thy will oh lord
[1:24:19] i've come to do all thy will i will not
[1:24:23] shrink on any part of thy will that's my
[1:24:26] testimony that should be your testimony
[1:24:28] to say you know and i'm here to tell you
[1:24:30] sometimes you you can feel faint like
[1:24:32] you're not going to make it you're
[1:24:34] inoculated
[1:24:36] hallelujah you've got the toxin
[1:24:39] don't worry it's stronger than anything
[1:24:41] the devil can do i don't care if it
[1:24:43] gives you a fever and you get sick and
[1:24:45] spiritual sickness sets in don't worry
[1:24:47] this thing will take you all the way
[1:24:49] home
[1:24:49] this thing will it'll surmount every
[1:24:52] obstacle it'll take you through every
[1:24:53] fear through every valley over every
[1:24:55] mountain it will bring me home to my
[1:24:58] father because the inoculation came down
[1:25:01] from my father
[1:25:04] amen
[1:25:05] and it held him
[1:25:07] all the way
[1:25:09] i love this
[1:25:10] he says here
[1:25:13] oh he says
[1:25:15] it wasn't so from the beginning that one
[1:25:17] was the way back here it isn't so from
[1:25:19] the beginning i'm i'm rushing to close
[1:25:20] this watch
[1:25:22] if god poured out the holy ghost on the
[1:25:24] people at pentecost and that was his
[1:25:26] decision
[1:25:27] that how that the church must operate
[1:25:29] under the power of the holy spirit he
[1:25:31] cannot change that he cannot turn it
[1:25:32] over and say well i'll give it to a
[1:25:34] bishop i can do give it to this or give
[1:25:35] it to that he's got to still remain with
[1:25:38] the same decision and if the church on
[1:25:41] the day of pentecost received the
[1:25:43] baptism of the holy ghost and the
[1:25:45] reaction that came from that baptism of
[1:25:48] the holy ghost will be the reaction on
[1:25:50] every person that ever receives the
[1:25:52] baptism of the holy ghost see it's a
[1:25:54] medicine if it's supposed to work watch
[1:25:57] this if it's supposed to work and
[1:25:59] operates on a certain person makes them
[1:26:01] act a certain way the next person takes
[1:26:04] a takes that it takes a hold of will
[1:26:06] have to act the same way for inoculation
[1:26:09] that's the way it is with the holy
[1:26:12] spirit with god his words are perfect he
[1:26:15] is infinite this friends is the power
[1:26:18] that we need at this time
[1:26:21] i'm here to tell you something that is
[1:26:22] the kind of power that's not just words
[1:26:25] on a quote this is describing a
[1:26:28] necessary element that better be in your
[1:26:30] life
[1:26:31] and husbands and wives and dads and moms
[1:26:34] and young people and preachers and
[1:26:36] deacons and trustees it better be in all
[1:26:38] of our lives because you're living in
[1:26:40] the complete total collapse of humanity
[1:26:44] humanity is in its last throws it's
[1:26:46] living out its last days the world the
[1:26:49] earth is suffering its last elements of
[1:26:52] man in a fallen condition and the earth
[1:26:54] is groaning for change
[1:26:57] brother branham deals with that he says
[1:26:58] you go back in the book of isaiah you
[1:27:00] you see all of these you see all of
[1:27:02] these uh terrible things of nature and
[1:27:05] earthquakes and volcanoes and typhoons
[1:27:08] and hurricanes and tornadoes and and
[1:27:10] nature in a revolt brother branham goes
[1:27:13] back to isaiah and proves it's it's the
[1:27:15] earth almost like a living being the
[1:27:18] earth trying to renew itself brother
[1:27:20] branham says it's trying to rid itself
[1:27:22] of man say oh all these thousands of
[1:27:24] people died the earth is behind that the
[1:27:27] earth is trying to get rid of sin it's
[1:27:29] groaning waiting for the adoption of
[1:27:32] sons of god
[1:27:33] someday we'll walk back on it again in
[1:27:35] the perfect paradises of god oh the
[1:27:38] future that lays just before us friends
[1:27:42] my
[1:27:42] there's such a power here what a
[1:27:44] challenge that's the challenge i want to
[1:27:46] give to the cherokee nation that's what
[1:27:48] i want to tell them and prove that god
[1:27:50] will will keep his word
[1:27:52] amen
[1:27:54] amen
[1:27:56] brother branham makes a statement in the
[1:27:58] sixth seal
[1:27:59] and i've just got these last two things
[1:28:01] and i'll hit them and we'll we'll pack
[1:28:02] it up
[1:28:05] brother adam is going to make a point
[1:28:06] and i'll read it for you here
[1:28:09] that people
[1:28:11] from the from the standpoint of human
[1:28:13] nature
[1:28:15] that they love living in the past
[1:28:19] they love they love that
[1:28:20] but
[1:28:21] but when it comes to religion
[1:28:24] no they don't want the past they want
[1:28:25] they want the modern
[1:28:27] and it's like weird it's like wha what's
[1:28:30] up with that he says here
[1:28:32] see now what what well i'm gonna tell
[1:28:34] you what proves it i'll cut to the chase
[1:28:35] a little bit and tell you what proves it
[1:28:36] it proves
[1:28:38] that demon power is operating the
[1:28:42] religions of the world
[1:28:44] it proves that all
[1:28:45] religion outside of god's word
[1:28:48] is controlled by the enemy because that
[1:28:52] that doesn't make sense you remember how
[1:28:55] i've i've taught you how that
[1:28:57] one of the ways you can know demonic
[1:28:59] influence is it'll cause you to do
[1:29:01] things that don't make sense
[1:29:03] and it's just like upside down
[1:29:05] like
[1:29:07] that doesn't even make common sense
[1:29:08] you're doing that you know i i remember
[1:29:11] speaking to a good friend of mine and
[1:29:14] you know here he is all these years
[1:29:17] and preaching the message of the hour
[1:29:19] and knows by the bible knows by the
[1:29:21] bible knows by the bible
[1:29:24] no longer believes in the prophet fine
[1:29:26] that's fine but he knows by the bible
[1:29:29] who the
[1:29:30] of revelation is
[1:29:32] he knows
[1:29:33] by the scriptures that denominationalism
[1:29:36] is leading people to the mark of the
[1:29:37] beast he knows what the image to the
[1:29:38] beast is
[1:29:40] he knows the number of her name
[1:29:41] he knows the blood of the martyrs are
[1:29:43] under her skirts and he knows who it is
[1:29:48] he knows jehovah's witness is a cult he
[1:29:50] knows mormonism is a cult he knows that
[1:29:53] by the scriptures
[1:29:55] and spends hours and weeks and months
[1:29:58] getting online
[1:30:00] attacking a message and a messenger
[1:30:03] who he also knows was a good man and he
[1:30:05] also knows was an honest decent man and
[1:30:07] he also knows the message produces godly
[1:30:10] people
[1:30:11] and he knows it he can't even deny it
[1:30:14] we are the evidence of it
[1:30:16] we are the evidence did you know that
[1:30:18] you're the evidence that this word is
[1:30:19] true
[1:30:20] because if we get an original word it
[1:30:22] should produce an original life
[1:30:25] and he knows that and i just ask him
[1:30:27] very his good friend still is and i just
[1:30:29] said buddy
[1:30:30] i said
[1:30:31] you don't realize you're under the
[1:30:34] control of a demon and he goes wow i
[1:30:36] can't believe you said that to me and i
[1:30:38] said well just look at what you're doing
[1:30:40] i said you know by the bible who the
[1:30:42] is you know what denominational
[1:30:45] system is you know 666. you know the the
[1:30:48] cults and everything you know that
[1:30:50] mormonism's not it's fake christianity
[1:30:52] jehovah's witness avoids jesus christ
[1:30:54] but i but i but i don't see you
[1:30:56] spending one moment
[1:30:58] online
[1:30:59] warning the world
[1:31:01] about those

[1:31:04] deadliness to the world and you know the
[1:31:06] whole world's gonna follow after it and
[1:31:08] you haven't spent one minute online with
[1:31:11] your videos telling the world about that
[1:31:13] though you have this stored up treasure
[1:31:15] and instead you're spending your months
[1:31:18] and weeks
[1:31:19] bashing a man who you know is a decent
[1:31:21] honest man even if you disagree with his
[1:31:23] doctor you know he's decent and honest
[1:31:25] you you you know it produces the kind of
[1:31:27] lives you see and the people you went to
[1:31:30] church with how and that makes sense to
[1:31:32] you
[1:31:34] i said you see friend it shows it shows
[1:31:37] you're under the control of a demon
[1:31:39] because that don't even make sense
[1:31:42] that's not even sensible
[1:31:44] it's not even logical from a common
[1:31:46] human standpoint who would do that
[1:31:48] somebody blinded
[1:31:51] somebody who's fell under the influence
[1:31:53] of an evil spirit and and i'm glad this
[1:31:56] thing ain't over i'm glad it ain't over
[1:31:58] i hey i get there's a militant response
[1:32:01] but like i was and
[1:32:03] and maybe i've even done it myself but
[1:32:05] you know this morning in the sunday
[1:32:06] school class we were all agreeing that
[1:32:08] we ought to have paul's uh
[1:32:11] response paul said when he's telling the
[1:32:14] church about people i mean you can't get
[1:32:17] worse than this they've become the
[1:32:19] enemies
[1:32:20] of the cross
[1:32:22] they've become the enemies of christ and
[1:32:24] paul said i tell you even weeping
[1:32:27] it just goes to show the heart of paul
[1:32:30] sometimes we want to let our righteous
[1:32:32] indignation rise up and oh they're
[1:32:34] finished they're done and that's it
[1:32:35] they're done
[1:32:36] they should just go to hell and burn
[1:32:37] forever and you know that's not paul's
[1:32:40] attitude jesus wept over jerusalem
[1:32:44] brother branham in the sixth seal when
[1:32:46] he when he tells about how that he said
[1:32:48] i saw something in there today and he
[1:32:50] said it took my breath away he said i
[1:32:52] had to get up and walk out in the yard
[1:32:54] and walk around to get back to myself
[1:32:56] and he he comes to the end of the
[1:32:58] service and he says he starts describing
[1:33:00] what he saw not in intricate detail but
[1:33:02] generally and he says the lord showed
[1:33:04] him
[1:33:05] people that he knew
[1:33:07] ministers men churches families and he
[1:33:10] knew them and he said
[1:33:12] already because of their rejection of
[1:33:14] the word they already were covered in
[1:33:16] blackness already across the line
[1:33:18] already couldn't even be saved and
[1:33:20] brother branham said i can't even say
[1:33:21] that i can't no i can't lord i can't
[1:33:23] refuse that i can't say that i can't say
[1:33:25] that from the pulpit i can't name those
[1:33:27] people
[1:33:29] here's a prophet standing in a pulp at
[1:33:31] one time said it was a saddest thing
[1:33:34] just the other day in a meeting
[1:33:37] and he said
[1:33:38] young people
[1:33:40] teenagers
[1:33:42] piled up around the altar
[1:33:45] trying to repent and i could already see
[1:33:48] it was too late
[1:33:51] they had already at some point crossed
[1:33:54] the line
[1:33:56] see it's not for me to decide it's not
[1:33:58] for you to decide i'm talking about what
[1:34:01] what kind of attitude is in our heart
[1:34:03] we ought to be brokenhearted we ought
[1:34:05] not to be indignant we ought to pray and
[1:34:08] have mercy and we ought to try to live
[1:34:10] it as best we can and somehow this thing
[1:34:12] ain't over
[1:34:13] this thing ain't over god can still move
[1:34:17] that's the kind of attitude i want to
[1:34:18] have that's the kind of attitude i want
[1:34:20] you to have that's the kind of attitude
[1:34:21] we need to have an outreach that's the
[1:34:23] kind of attitude we have need to have
[1:34:25] when we go among the cherokees that's
[1:34:26] the kind of attitude we need to have on
[1:34:28] the streets of beaufort
[1:34:30] god can if god found me he can find
[1:34:32] anybody if god saved me he and hang on
[1:34:35] to me he can save and hang on to anybody
[1:34:40] your heart should be brother sister come
[1:34:42] to your senses
[1:34:44] see but if you cut yourself off with the
[1:34:46] wrong attitude toward them and they
[1:34:48] detect that as if they wouldn't they
[1:34:50] will
[1:34:51] and if you cut yourself off
[1:34:53] from even being able to help them
[1:34:56] well then what good are you
[1:34:58] see
[1:34:59] so i'm glad that as the bible says let a
[1:35:02] man examine himself
[1:35:05] see brother branham says
[1:35:06] in the sixth seal
[1:35:08] oh my
[1:35:10] he says
[1:35:11] and then in kentucky
[1:35:14] they're trying to live in a bygone days
[1:35:16] of the east here still back in
[1:35:18] in renfrew valley they still have that
[1:35:20] to this day
[1:35:22] so back in the renfrow valley and things
[1:35:24] you go back to the old days there's
[1:35:26] something
[1:35:27] causing that
[1:35:29] that people would say oh i i long for
[1:35:32] the old days
[1:35:34] most time it's you're fantasizing over a
[1:35:36] day that never really existed when you
[1:35:38] were there but but a lot of times
[1:35:40] there's the there's this longing to go
[1:35:42] back to something and brother branham
[1:35:44] says there's something causing that but
[1:35:47] when it comes
[1:35:49] but when it comes back to go back to a
[1:35:51] gospel in the original you don't want to
[1:35:53] do that you want something modern you
[1:35:56] see
[1:35:57] goes to show see
[1:35:59] there's a what makes a man do wrong
[1:36:02] what makes him drink and carry on or
[1:36:04] woman do wrong it's because
[1:36:07] he or she
[1:36:08] is trying there is something in her
[1:36:11] thirsting there is something in him
[1:36:14] thirsting and they're trying to quench
[1:36:16] that holy thirst with the things of the
[1:36:18] world when god ought to be that quench
[1:36:21] he made you that way to thirst that's
[1:36:24] the reason you thirst for something god
[1:36:26] made you that way so you would turn that
[1:36:29] holy thirst to him
[1:36:31] but when you try to quench that thirst
[1:36:34] how dare anybody to do that you have no
[1:36:37] right to do that you try to quench the
[1:36:40] holy thirst that you're thirsting for
[1:36:42] something and then you turn it into the
[1:36:44] world
[1:36:46] trying to satisfy it with the world you
[1:36:48] can't do it there's only one thing will
[1:36:51] fill that up and that's god
[1:36:54] he
[1:36:55] made you
[1:36:56] that way
[1:36:59] to try to chase happiness in the world
[1:37:01] you're fighting against your own makeup
[1:37:04] no wonder people are miserable and
[1:37:06] depressed and living on tranquilizers
[1:37:08] because they literally their greatest
[1:37:11] enemy is that guy or gal that's
[1:37:14] standing in the mirror
[1:37:16] looking at them
[1:37:18] amen and so he says i'll tell you one
[1:37:21] morning when jesus and his bride i love
[1:37:23] this
[1:37:25] one morning when he comes back to the
[1:37:26] earth
[1:37:27] there'll be a paradise of god there that
[1:37:29] oh my them old warriors of the battle
[1:37:32] walked down through there with their
[1:37:33] friends and loved ones
[1:37:35] the anthems will fill the air of the
[1:37:37] angelic coast our future's bright
[1:37:39] friends
[1:37:40] oh it was well done my good and faithful
[1:37:43] servant enter into the joys of the lord
[1:37:46] that's been prepared for you like you
[1:37:48] should have had back there before eve
[1:37:52] started the ball rolling in sin amen he
[1:37:54] says yes see so the sixth seal is going
[1:37:57] to do something yes sir truly the whole
[1:38:00] world is groaning and and in pain for
[1:38:04] the millennium age
[1:38:06] i i love that fact
[1:38:10] that he says it here
[1:38:11] there's a world you're longing for a
[1:38:14] world and you're going to get a world
[1:38:16] like you should have had in the
[1:38:18] beginning
[1:38:19] you're going to have a body like you
[1:38:20] should have had in the beginning i i
[1:38:22] thought about that and i thought about
[1:38:23] all my ups and downs and weaknesses and
[1:38:25] trials of life and i said lord
[1:38:28] i wasn't even supposed to be built like
[1:38:30] this i wasn't supposed to have these
[1:38:31] kind of failures i wasn't supposed to
[1:38:32] live in a crazy world
[1:38:34] the bible the bible talks about brother
[1:38:36] adam says we live in a neurotic age that
[1:38:39] we seem unfitted for
[1:38:42] it's it's just a constant now if you're
[1:38:44] a sinner you love it you go man you
[1:38:47] can't get enough of it you you the
[1:38:49] reason you can't get enough of it
[1:38:50] because there's no way to quench that
[1:38:51] thirst you just keep going until it
[1:38:52] takes all your money and all your health
[1:38:54] and all your life and all your home and
[1:38:55] your and that's why marriage collapse
[1:38:57] and young people commit suicide because
[1:39:00] they're chasing uh something like
[1:39:01] chasing the wind
[1:39:03] but when you come back around and you
[1:39:05] realize
[1:39:06] i just thought about myself and i just
[1:39:08] thought you know something friends i'm
[1:39:10] gonna tell you
[1:39:11] when i get on the other side brother
[1:39:12] branham talked about people going to be
[1:39:14] there
[1:39:15] that's going to shock you
[1:39:17] i'm going to tell you the most shocked
[1:39:19] person in the world
[1:39:21] that i'm going to see
[1:39:22] is the very first mirror i step in front
[1:39:24] of
[1:39:25] on the other side
[1:39:27] when i step in front of that very first
[1:39:30] mirror on the other side i'm going to be
[1:39:32] so surprised i'm going to look at that
[1:39:34] dude and say
[1:39:36] you made it
[1:39:38] really
[1:39:39] you made it yep
[1:39:41] here i am how'd you get here
[1:39:44] grace grace
[1:39:47] god's grace
[1:39:49] grace that is greater than all our sin
[1:39:54] grace grace
[1:39:57] god's grace grace that is greater than
[1:40:02] all my sin
[1:40:05] a world brother branham starts telling
[1:40:08] he he finishes you should just i don't
[1:40:10] want to ruin it for you you should go
[1:40:11] listen to that sixth seal i told sister
[1:40:13] debbie
[1:40:15] you know and i said you want to hear a
[1:40:16] good tape i said hear the sex seal
[1:40:18] brother madame explain so
[1:40:21] much that's going on in there how the
[1:40:23] word is going to go forth how the sealed
[1:40:25] and those who are going to be sealed and
[1:40:26] those who aren't and
[1:40:28] you know and
[1:40:29] and and a message so great that that the
[1:40:32] unwise virgin of every age didn't have
[1:40:34] to go through the tribulation but this
[1:40:36] one will because she rejected the
[1:40:38] greatest message ever to strike the
[1:40:40] earth see
[1:40:41] and and even you remember those two
[1:40:43] tribes dan and ephraim that got blotted
[1:40:46] out from under heaven
[1:40:47] do you know when you go to ezekiel and
[1:40:49] when you read it and when you when you
[1:40:51] read uh revelation 7 they're not there
[1:40:55] and but if you go to read ezekiel 48
[1:40:57] which is the millennium chapter
[1:40:59] brother branham used ezekiel 48 for the
[1:41:01] millennium chapter
[1:41:02] there they are they're listed right
[1:41:04] there again
[1:41:06] grace grace brother branham said see
[1:41:08] they might have been blotted out from
[1:41:10] under heaven but they're not blotted out
[1:41:12] in heaven
[1:41:13] and say well what what what did that
[1:41:15] cost them being blotted out from under
[1:41:17] heaven well they had no opportunity to
[1:41:19] be elected
[1:41:20] they're not listed in those 144 000 they
[1:41:23] literally
[1:41:24] blotted out from under heaven meant they
[1:41:26] didn't even have the opportunity to be
[1:41:27] the 144 000 there was even no chance for
[1:41:30] them to be that because why they were an
[1:41:33] old testament type of the unwise virgin
[1:41:35] who suffered for rejecting the message
[1:41:38] of their hour and all of their prophets
[1:41:40] beginning at moses
[1:41:42] and and but yet but yet now look at this
[1:41:45] here's here's an amazing thing
[1:41:48] the
[1:41:49] the old testament
[1:41:52] dan and ephraim
[1:41:54] a type of the unwise virgin
[1:41:56] get to be in the millennium
[1:41:59] the gentile
[1:42:01] unwise virgin do not
[1:42:04] only the 144 000 are there with us as
[1:42:06] attendance to the bride
[1:42:08] the unwise virgins sleep for a thousand
[1:42:11] years and come up at the at the back
[1:42:13] side of it see say well good grief that
[1:42:16] don't sound fair why did why did they
[1:42:18] get to be in the millennium but these
[1:42:19] don't because these
[1:42:21] rejected under the age of the holy ghost
[1:42:24] this was just blood of bulls and goats
[1:42:25] you see
[1:42:26] and so they weren't blotted out in
[1:42:28] heaven in the millennium they're back
[1:42:29] there again in their tribal order
[1:42:31] but but the unwise virgin rejected i
[1:42:34] mean think now think about how important
[1:42:36] this message is
[1:42:38] it's literally the deciding factor
[1:42:40] it literally takes two righteous people
[1:42:42] one of them going to rapture one don't
[1:42:44] one's in a millennium the other is not
[1:42:45] and what's the deciding factor belief in
[1:42:47] the word
[1:42:49] acceptance and because that because it
[1:42:51] takes the new birth and new birth only
[1:42:53] comes by faith in the revealed word
[1:42:54] there's no other way to get it and only
[1:42:56] the holy ghost can give it to you i
[1:42:57] can't give it to you no one else can
[1:42:58] give it to you you have to have a
[1:43:00] personal revelation given to you
[1:43:02] personally by jesus christ and then you
[1:43:05] then now it's on you to gird up the
[1:43:07] loins of your mind and
[1:43:09] and avail yourselves of the grace that
[1:43:12] is promised to be given at the
[1:43:14] revelation of jesus christ brother
[1:43:16] branham starts telling
[1:43:18] very tenderly
[1:43:19] he uh
[1:43:20] he says you know he says this just
[1:43:22] personal now he says you know he says i
[1:43:25] i dreamed the other night he said my
[1:43:27] wife came to me me done
[1:43:29] said she said bill i'll ask you a
[1:43:31] question about heaven
[1:43:33] he said all right honey sit down
[1:43:35] she said well
[1:43:37] she said you know
[1:43:40] you loved hope and he goes
[1:43:42] and i still do and she said you know you
[1:43:44] love me yes
[1:43:46] and she said now i don't think i would
[1:43:49] have a problem
[1:43:50] but hope was a really jealous woman
[1:43:53] so
[1:43:54] in heaven
[1:43:55] who who gets to be your wife and he said
[1:43:58] both of you
[1:44:00] and she said i don't understand he said
[1:44:02] see honey it's not like it is now
[1:44:05] there there's no difference in the sex
[1:44:07] glands i said we're just he said now the
[1:44:09] form of a man in a form of a woman
[1:44:11] remain
[1:44:12] but the sex lands are only added for
[1:44:14] reproduction he says it'll be a love so
[1:44:16] much more than that you won't even it
[1:44:18] won't even enter your mind the fallen
[1:44:20] way of love down here that won't even be
[1:44:23] a thought in your mind
[1:44:24] and he says look let me let me let me
[1:44:26] give it to you like this he says now
[1:44:30] says you know i love you yes bill and i
[1:44:32] and you love me yes well
[1:44:34] said if it had to be a showdown
[1:44:37] between me
[1:44:39] and the lord jesus who would you choose
[1:44:42] and she said i would choose the lord she
[1:44:44] said no bill i do love you no matter how
[1:44:47] much i love you if i could if i had to
[1:44:49] give one up i'd give you up and keep him
[1:44:51] and he said thank you sweetheart he said
[1:44:53] that makes me glad to hear you say that
[1:44:55] see
[1:44:56] because then he knows he'll have her as
[1:44:57] an eternal treasure anyway
[1:45:00] and so he says i'm glad he says now
[1:45:02] let's imagine he said let's imagine i
[1:45:04] get all cleaned up
[1:45:05] and he said i go down the streets all
[1:45:07] dressed up and he said some prostitute
[1:45:10] woman comes running up to me throwing
[1:45:12] her arms around me saying oh i sure do
[1:45:15] love you
[1:45:17] and he said how would that make you feel
[1:45:19] and she said
[1:45:20] i don't think i would like that too good
[1:45:24] and he says all right he says but now
[1:45:26] what if it was the lord jesus walking
[1:45:28] down the street and that same prostitute
[1:45:30] ran and threw her arms around and said
[1:45:31] jesus i love you
[1:45:33] she said oh i would enjoy that he said
[1:45:36] you see there he said it's just a love
[1:45:39] so much higher that you can't even
[1:45:41] imagine
[1:45:42] and he says he says i was i was he said
[1:45:44] i had a dream the other night i'm going
[1:45:46] to close friends you're good can i take
[1:45:47] another minute
[1:45:48] he says i had a dream you should go hear
[1:45:50] it yourself
[1:45:51] and you want to have a church service
[1:45:53] and you go hear it
[1:45:55] and he says
[1:45:56] he says i had a dream and he says i was
[1:45:59] at the rewards ceremony he said no not
[1:46:01] the judgment bar we're talking talking
[1:46:03] about when the when the crowns are being
[1:46:05] given out there remember three and a
[1:46:06] half years in heaven ain't just sitting

[1:46:11] going to go on
[1:46:12] and and brother branham says i was there
[1:46:14] at the when the crowns were being handed
[1:46:16] out and he said
[1:46:17] and he said i was just kind of standing

[1:46:41] come and he said oh i know them he said
[1:46:43] it'd be a brother and a sister
