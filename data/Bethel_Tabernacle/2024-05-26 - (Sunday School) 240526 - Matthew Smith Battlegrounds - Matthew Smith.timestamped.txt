[5:40] good morning
[5:41] everybody um let's all uh stand this
[5:44] morning have a word of
[5:48] prayer dear precious father Lord we're
[5:52] very honored to be here this morning
[5:53] Lord grateful to
[5:56] be in good health father and sound mind
[6:00] father that in a place where we could
[6:02] come and gather together in your name in
[6:05] a in a common Church Lord that we could
[6:09] all come together
[6:10] and enjoy the Gathering of the Saints
[6:14] Lord enjoy the move movement of your
[6:16] spirit
[6:17] Lord father we ask you would meet us
[6:21] here Lord that we would open up our
[6:23] hearts open up our minds consecrate
[6:26] ourselves to you turning aside side from
[6:30] anything that
[6:31] would distract us turning our hearts to
[6:34] the things of your
[6:37] kingdom you might edify us and grow us
[6:40] encourage Us in the
[6:42] way that you would take the few words
[6:44] that I have these few notes Lord and
[6:46] that you would move on it and that you
[6:48] would touch the heart of the people that
[6:50] whoever would be listening whatever need
[6:52] that they would have that something
[6:53] might be said to give an encouragement
[6:56] or a spark of a spark of Faith Lord that
[7:00] they
[7:01] could they could withstand this dark
[7:03] Time Lord we ask these things in the
[7:06] precious Name Lord Jesus Christ
[7:10] amen want to ask if you would um turn to
[7:15] Ephesians chapter
[7:23] 6 and we're going to go to verse 12
[7:39] my thought here I've either through
[7:42] Sunday schools or just ministering here
[7:43] I've I've taken this very similar
[7:46] thought in the past but it's it's been
[7:48] so strong in my heart again I figured i'
[7:50] I'd take it again maybe someone hears
[7:51] something so if you hear something that
[7:53] I've said in the in the past all over
[7:55] again then don't mind maybe you needed
[7:57] to hear it twice
[7:59] but uh maybe someone else needed to hear
[8:01] it for the first
[8:04] time but all right so Ephesians chapter
[8:07] 6 in verse
[8:11] 12 and it says for we wrestled not
[8:14] against flesh and blood but against
[8:16] principalities against Powers against
[8:17] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[8:20] against spiritual wickedness in high
[8:23] places that you know be seated
[8:30] I want to take for a a thought just
[8:32] taking the the the thought of
[8:34] Battlegrounds spiritual
[8:38] Battlegrounds
[8:40] but there was
[8:43] a in January of
[8:48] 1941 the Japanese High command got
[8:51] together and had a a big
[8:53] meeting with the Imperial Japanese Navy
[8:57] and the Army and everything and they
[8:58] have this huge meeting and
[9:00] they the decision was made don't know
[9:03] exactly when but some one day in January
[9:05] of 1941 the decision was made that they
[9:08] were going to go to war with the United
[9:10] States and that their initial attack was
[9:14] going to be at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii
[9:18] and but that was just the opening
[9:21] because the most of what they were
[9:23] interested in was actually all of the US
[9:26] Holdings in the South Pacific um a lot
[9:29] of attention basically gets put on Pearl
[9:31] Harbor but really Pearl Harbor was just
[9:34] the cover for what was actually
[9:36] happening in the Philippines which was
[9:38] that they were going to attack the uh
[9:40] because at the time the Philippines was
[9:42] a US territory as much as Hawaii was a
[9:44] US Territory um a US colony and it as
[9:48] much as Puerto Rico is a US territory
[9:50] now um and the Japanese were planning on
[9:55] taking the Philippines and in order to
[9:56] do so they were going to need to
[9:59] the US Navy in Pearl Harbor and so the
[10:01] decision was made to attack the Navy so
[10:04] they couldn't respond to the attack in
[10:06] the Philippines and all this was going
[10:07] to happen in the space of a day right
[10:10] they the Japanese were planning to do
[10:12] this carry out several different
[10:14] operations across South Pacific and it
[10:16] was all going to happen at the same
[10:17] time and it was going to start with
[10:19] Pearl
[10:22] Harbor and for the next
[10:24] year the Japanese military knew that
[10:27] they were at war with the United States
[10:28] and the United United States did
[10:30] not United States had no idea they might
[10:33] have had some inclination they might
[10:35] have had suspicions but they didn't as
[10:36] far as the American public were
[10:37] concerned as far as the rank and file of
[10:39] the US military nobody had any idea what
[10:41] was coming right they had no idea that
[10:44] they were at War but they
[10:46] were right they were completely
[10:47] oblivious to the fact that there was a
[10:49] military preparing to slaughter them all
[10:52] and
[10:54] completely oblivious right had no
[10:57] idea and this goes on for a year that
[11:00] was in January of
[11:06] 1941 and in December of 1941 almost a
[11:09] year later is when the attack actually
[11:12] came so for a full year the Japanese
[11:14] know there's a war on and the US
[11:17] doesn't and
[11:19] at 610 a.m. off the coast of
[11:23] aaho on the light first light of dawn
[11:27] Japanese planes take off aircraft
[11:29] carriers and they know they're at War
[11:32] and the sailors at Pearl Harbor have no
[11:34] idea they don't know they're at War yet
[11:36] but they
[11:40] are and when a American radar technician
[11:44] sees a flight of aircraft coming towards
[11:47] aahu he says to himself we're not at
[11:52] War these must be American planes
[11:54] returning home sooner than we
[11:56] scheduled and so he disregards the
[11:59] report it's just American planes because
[12:02] he's not thinking he's at War
[12:06] yet and then at 700
[12:10] a.m. the bombs start falling and a lot
[12:13] of American boys don't go home that day
[12:16] a lot of a lot of mamas got folded flags
[12:19] and a lot of a lot of wives had to
[12:21] explain to little kids that daddy's not
[12:23] coming home
[12:25] because the US didn't realize that they
[12:28] were at War when they enemy knew that
[12:29] they had been for a year they didn't
[12:32] prepare they they were completely
[12:34] unawares they were they they didn't
[12:36] concern themselves with defense
[12:39] because they didn't think that they were
[12:41] they needed
[12:43] to and so often times we in terms of
[12:46] spiritual matters we don't recognize
[12:49] that we are in an actual real deal War
[12:52] it's not it's not metaphorical it's not
[12:55] you know when when it says that we
[12:57] wrestle against principalities and
[12:59] Powers the air it's not it's not a
[13:01] metaphorical battle it's not a it's not
[13:05] just it's not just a an analogy it's a
[13:08] real thing and it has real consequences
[13:10] and it has real casualties and there are
[13:12] people who actually
[13:14] die you know cancer uh uh disease all
[13:18] these things these are ultimately
[13:19] spirits that come on to people and this
[13:22] is all this is all fought in the
[13:23] spiritual realm right you know you have
[13:27] p real PS when you end up with somebody
[13:29] who's got an addiction that they can't
[13:31] kick completely a slave to a substance
[13:33] that's a
[13:34] p right that's a prisoner of of a of a
[13:37] spirit that has has its hold on
[13:40] them and so we can't ever fail to
[13:45] recognize that we have we are surrounded
[13:49] on all sides by by spiritual forces that
[13:51] are actively trying not to ruin your day
[13:54] they're not trying to spoil the whipped
[13:55] cream for your
[13:56] strawberries right they are trying to
[13:58] destroy destroy you they're trying to
[14:00] ruin your life take your life destroy
[14:04] you and destroy your children it's it's
[14:06] not a it's not
[14:08] nothing
[14:11] and because of that because we don't we
[14:13] don't think in terms that this is a a
[14:16] real conflict that has to be taken in
[14:18] the same strictness as an
[14:22] actual or or a physical battle you know
[14:24] we think of military
[14:28] security you don't just go wandering
[14:30] onto a military base best case scenario
[14:32] you go away in
[14:34] handcuffs best case scenario right worst
[14:38] case scenario you go home in a body bag
[14:40] or I guess not home but be kind of
[14:42] horrible to send someone to their home
[14:44] in a body bag but you know there there
[14:48] there military installations where they
[14:49] got big old signs that say Enter you
[14:51] know we shoot on site there ain't no
[14:53] warning shots and they mean it you know
[14:57] you don't you don't you don't just go
[14:59] wandering and because security is
[15:01] important people die if they don't take
[15:03] take these matters very
[15:06] seriously and so how many times people
[15:09] we get lacked in the things that we
[15:11] allow into our lives we get super lack
[15:15] in you know like the the guy on on in
[15:19] Hawaii you know he's he's seeing on the
[15:21] radar he sees the enemy he could have
[15:22] warned people they could have been
[15:23] prepared they could have had been
[15:25] Manning the guns but instead they
[15:27] weren't because he he wasn't he was you
[15:30] know not thinking that it was a big
[15:32] deal you
[15:34] know and so in so many times we we don't
[15:38] recognize that the conflict is so
[15:40] serious that we allow media into the
[15:43] house that shouldn't be there we
[15:45] participate in in conversations we have
[15:49] associations and friendships that we
[15:52] really shouldn't have because at the end
[15:54] of the
[15:56] day the guy that you're fighting the
[15:59] your main
[16:00] combatant is the guy in the mirror right
[16:04] we we want to put it all off on onto you
[16:06] know the devil or or whatever but at the
[16:08] end of the day the greatest battle that
[16:09] ever that has ever been fought happens
[16:11] between your
[16:12] ears right at the end of the day you're
[16:15] you know
[16:18] you're you know I've read this quote so
[16:20] many
[16:21] times and I I always keep coming back to
[16:25] it it says as questions and answerers
[16:28] 1950 1959 it says Canaan is not a typee
[16:30] of the Millennium because they had Wars
[16:32] fightings killings and everything else
[16:33] in Canaan Canaan is a type of the Holy
[16:35] Ghost Egypt is the world that they come
[16:37] out of the Wilderness is where they were
[16:39] Sanctified called out Church Canaan is
[16:41] where they settled down with the holy
[16:43] spirit because they still had Wars and
[16:45] if you don't believe you have wars just
[16:48] get the Holy Spirit want okay and what
[16:52] happens is so many times people you know
[16:55] you're born in sin shaped iniquity and
[16:57] you have an unregenerated nature
[16:59] and when your flesh desires to do
[17:01] something evil your spirit agrees
[17:03] because they are totally in line with
[17:05] each other right and there's nothing to
[17:07] say no there's no struggle there there's
[17:09] no battle there there's no battle
[17:11] against your nature to do something that
[17:13] you know is wrong
[17:15] because it's all
[17:18] chasing evil but when you get the Holy
[17:21] Spirit suddenly there's conflict because
[17:23] when your flesh wants to do one thing
[17:24] there's a holy spirit that says you will
[17:26] not right and so now there's a there's a
[17:29] there's a
[17:30] struggle
[17:33] and the guy that we're so our struggle
[17:36] is against the flesh that is constantly
[17:39] trying to do evil right and he's
[17:41] influenced by this environment that he's
[17:43] in though at the end of the
[17:48] day at the end of the day your flesh man
[17:52] is basically just a chimpanzee with an
[17:54] IQ score right he's got all the
[17:57] proclivities of of of an animal he's got
[18:01] all the proclivities of just no no real
[18:05] spiritual awareness and so many times
[18:07] people have you know people think that
[18:10] they have they make decisions and they
[18:11] they think that they're you know people
[18:13] think they're a lot smarter than they
[18:14] actually are people think they're making
[18:17] decisions logically and and with all
[18:19] kinds of you know pre-thought but
[18:21] reality most times decisions are made
[18:24] emotionally and and your logic is after
[18:27] the fact you come up with a reason for
[18:30] what you're doing after you've already
[18:31] decided to do it right that's just
[18:34] people operate
[18:37] and
[18:39] unfortunately all that emot you know
[18:42] that that spiritual realm that
[18:44] conscience and reason and memories and
[18:45] affections these are all so easily
[18:48] influenced because it's all part of your
[18:52] physical
[18:53] person right it's all part of your
[18:55] physical person you know the the are
[18:59] triggers and there psychological things
[19:00] that happen in your brain that are going
[19:02] to cause you to feel certain kinds of
[19:04] ways whether you want to or not no
[19:06] matter how smart you are no matter how
[19:08] logical you can try to reason yourself
[19:09] out of it it doesn't change certain
[19:13] realities for instance no matter how
[19:16] smart you think you are you get around a
[19:20] certain kind of person you will become
[19:22] that certain kind of person right you
[19:25] are the sum of your five closest
[19:27] Associates the people you see every day
[19:29] are who your flesh will become that's
[19:32] just all there is to it and no matter
[19:33] how smart you are no matter how hard you
[19:35] try to just make that not a reality
[19:38] it'll seep in eventually right your
[19:41] associations will change who you are and
[19:43] if you think that it
[19:45] doesn't get around somebody that you
[19:47] don't like for a while but you got to
[19:49] work with especially like a cooworker
[19:50] that you have a hard time with and it's
[19:53] only a matter of time but you'll start
[19:54] noticing you do stuff like they do and
[19:56] you you can't stand it right
[19:59] it it'll drive you
[20:01] nuts but because that's that's that's
[20:05] the flesh
[20:07] right and the battle that you're
[20:09] fighting against that
[20:11] flesh is
[20:14] to come totally under subjection of the
[20:16] word
[20:19] right and um I so appreciated brother
[20:23] Don's uh sermon on Wednesday I had
[20:26] actually had put this together before he
[20:28] preached that and it so struck me
[20:31] because you know where he was going down
[20:33] that line of how people will think that
[20:39] there's thoughts that are arising that
[20:40] are them but it's it's not really them
[20:44] right so many times you think that you
[20:45] have a thought arising in your mind
[20:47] that's contrary to the word but that's
[20:49] not you you have to
[20:50] recognize there's a real you on the
[20:52] inside that's not the chimpanzee with an
[20:55] IQ score right that's it's not who you
[20:59] are that's somebody that you got tied to
[21:02] right that's something that you are
[21:03] stuck with until the until the body
[21:06] change
[21:08] right and so when the word of God
[21:11] says there you're going to be made more
[21:13] than a conqueror then you have to accept
[21:16] the fact that that is that is true right
[21:19] it says we are made more than conquerors
[21:20] right now whether your memory agrees
[21:24] with that or
[21:25] not right you you know
[21:29] there's a this is from uh greatest
[21:32] battle ever fought says if you'll come
[21:35] and you'll keep them memories and
[21:36] conscience and everything thinking about
[21:39] well I might fail it might not be right
[21:41] don't you do that at all you throw aside
[21:45] everything and open up the channel and
[21:46] say God your word is eternally true and
[21:49] it's for me if the whole church fails if
[21:51] the whole world fails yet I can't fail
[21:54] because I'm taking your word there's the
[21:56] battle okay that's the battle line right
[21:59] there that when the Bible says that you
[22:01] can overcome anything that besets you
[22:04] you say that's true and I I am an
[22:07] overcomer regardless of whether or not
[22:09] you just fell on your face right that
[22:11] when when you make an absolute hash out
[22:14] of things you stand back up and you
[22:16] repent and say Lord I'm sorry and I'm
[22:18] taking your word to carry on that I've
[22:20] overcome this right that no matter what
[22:23] no matter what report you get whether it
[22:26] is it is um
[22:29] no matter how bad things might seem no
[22:32] matter how bad you might
[22:34] fail in your
[22:37] flesh right you say but that's not me
[22:40] that's not who I am I'm taking the word
[22:42] of God that says I'm redeemed and above
[22:45] that and then you press
[22:47] forward no matter what what the devil
[22:49] throws at you no matter no matter
[22:52] um
[22:54] uh just just no matter Come What May and
[22:58] but on the other hand we also have
[23:01] to we have to be honest with
[23:05] ourselves
[23:07] in what we allow into our lives and
[23:10] allow to influence our spiritual
[23:14] environment right so many times it's
[23:17] this is just a sort of a military truism
[23:21] that the weather pretty much determines
[23:24] the battle right it doesn't matter how
[23:28] big and powerful your tanks are if the
[23:31] weather is so bad that the ground has
[23:33] turned into mush your tanks will get
[23:36] bogged down and will be very easily
[23:39] destroyed they will be annihilated if
[23:42] you try to operate in bad weather and in
[23:45] some cases bad weather is great because
[23:47] it means you can move around with you
[23:49] know without is as with without certain
[23:52] um uh like uh spy planes and things and
[23:56] so likewise we have a spiritual
[23:58] environment we have a the weather the
[24:00] spiritual weather around you is
[24:02] absolutely determined by the media and
[24:05] the the people and the atmosphere around
[24:08] you right you know
[24:12] how you know it talk you know the Bible
[24:15] says faith comeing by hearing the
[24:16] word well if you're
[24:19] constantly you know allowing things into
[24:22] your home that are not the word right
[24:25] you're constantly allowing the product
[24:27] of Satan's e
[24:29] to be in your home right you constantly
[24:32] have media that's contrary to the word
[24:34] of God playing in your home what's that
[24:37] doing to the spiritual environment of
[24:38] your home right what's that doing to the
[24:41] spiritual environment how are you
[24:42] supposed to have strength to combat the
[24:45] devil when everything all the all the
[24:48] the the you know entertainment that
[24:50] you're consuming is directly contrary to
[24:53] the thing that's supposed to give you
[24:54] strength right how are you supposed to
[24:58] you know have faith when the people you
[25:01] choose to hang out with bring you doubt
[25:04] right how are you supposed to be
[25:06] pressing for Holiness when you're
[25:09] constantly feeding on
[25:12] unholiness right this is and it's simple
[25:16] and it's not it's I I know this is kind
[25:18] of
[25:19] like I guess it's Sunday school right um
[25:23] it's simple but you know I I heard a an
[25:26] interview with an engineer he was a
[25:28] actually one of the guys who worked on a
[25:29] lot of the social media platforms that
[25:32] I'm sure we all know of um and he's very
[25:36] much against social media because he's
[25:38] basically like listen if you don't think
[25:40] that these are systems engineered to
[25:43] control your mind then I have a let me I
[25:46] have news for you he's like I built them
[25:48] I know exactly what we did like he he
[25:51] has a he's a um psychology background he
[25:53] was brought in specifically to engineer
[25:56] these social media platforms to be
[25:58] become addictive and and to manipulate
[26:01] people
[26:02] psychologically and he goes you know the
[26:03] funny thing about it is you know I built
[26:06] the platform I know exactly how it works
[26:09] I you know you know me and my team
[26:13] engineered a lot of the things that you
[26:14] take for granted in social media we came
[26:16] up with the
[26:17] idea because we knew that it would get
[26:19] people hooked that you know it's con
[26:22] it's that constant feedback loop of
[26:24] wanting you know you know that the way
[26:26] the algorithm will feed you content and
[26:28] things like that and he said the way
[26:30] that you know that it works is because
[26:32] it works on you even when you know it's
[26:34] happening yes you can be 100% aware that
[26:37] it's happening and it'll still work on
[26:39] you you can know that it's manipulating
[26:42] you and you're you just got to click on
[26:45] the next video you just got to scroll a
[26:47] little longer right because you because
[26:51] your brain is just feeding on that that
[26:52] little bit of you know those those
[26:54] psychological
[26:56] buttons and so
[26:59] you know we know that we can be
[27:02] manipulated we know that this is the
[27:03] environment that we're in we know that
[27:06] that the media that we have you know
[27:08] whether it's social media or or any kind
[27:10] of media really it's engineered to to
[27:12] pull you in to to drag you in even if
[27:15] it's not
[27:15] necessarily you know something UNH
[27:17] wholesome or or or vile it's still
[27:20] something that's distracting you you
[27:23] know it's still something that's eating
[27:24] your time it's still something that you
[27:27] know oh well you know you know we know
[27:30] it I know it's very simple I know it's
[27:31] very simplistic I know it's almost like
[27:33] well you know this is almost a message
[27:36] for little kids and yet we're adults and
[27:39] still addicted to our phones
[27:42] and you know it's it it doesn't matter
[27:45] who you are you can know that it's
[27:46] working on you and it's still working on
[27:48] you right and so you know I
[27:53] just I guess you know I would just be if
[27:56] I have a a takeaway from this it's that
[27:59] you know in this in this day and age in
[28:01] this
[28:02] time where we are we are pressing
[28:07] towards you know the the straight and
[28:10] narrow way is getting so narrow that
[28:12] there's there's
[28:14] no there's no turning to the left hand
[28:16] or the right there's no margin for error
[28:19] there's no room for
[28:22] for for for slack right everything has
[28:27] to be has has to be so precise because
[28:31] you know you know Bible says that in the
[28:35] last day that you know it would be so
[28:37] close as to deceive the very elect if it
[28:39] were possible you know we're coming to a
[28:42] point
[28:43] where you
[28:45] know there's there's not going to be a a
[28:48] clear line of separation of who's making
[28:52] it and who's not and it's I can I can
[28:54] one thing I know for sure it's going to
[28:55] be the people who are of avoiding
[28:58] feeding on the on the product of Satan's
[29:01] Eden and then feeding instead on the
[29:02] things of God that's one thing I know
[29:04] for sure is that the more you turn off
[29:07] YouTube and instead turn on the prophet
[29:09] of the age the better right you're
[29:13] you're and everything everything in this
[29:16] world is engineered to siphon away as
[29:19] much time as it can right to just
[29:22] distract you to keep your eyes glued to
[29:24] it and to and to carnal eyesee the
[29:28] atmosphere that you're in right to keep
[29:30] your eyes on things of the world because
[29:33] as long as you're looking on things of
[29:34] the world there's no it's it's it's
[29:37] muddying your faith it's or it's mud
[29:40] muddying your spiritual senses to the to
[29:42] the to the things going on around you
[29:46] and you know I I know it's it's as I
[29:50] said it seems simplistic it
[29:53] seems um maybe simple but at the
[29:58] but you know so often times it's the
[30:00] simple things that it's the little foxes
[30:02] you know that spoil the vine it's the
[30:04] simple things that we
[30:07] don't we don't pay attention to that
[30:11] will just absolutely destroy
[30:14] us and so I just you know as a as an
[30:17] encouragement maybe that that we would
[30:20] we would lay aside a lot of
[30:22] this to just press press into into press
[30:27] against that that nature press against
[30:29] the flesh that doesn't want to feed on
[30:32] the word press against that that flesh
[30:34] that doesn't that so desperately wants
[30:37] to turn away to to carnal things to to
[30:41] to worldly things and instead just keep
[30:44] your mind ever ever focused on things of
[30:46] the of the word things of of a of a
[30:50] um of a spiritual of a Godly spiritual
[30:55] um uh nature because
[30:59] you know the that atmosphere that you
[31:03] build build for yourself you know you
[31:05] you create an atmosphere around yourself
[31:08] and that atmosphere is absolutely going
[31:11] to
[31:12] influence um you know who who we are
[31:17] it's you know we think you know just I
[31:21] I'll just finish off with this just as a
[31:23] closing thought you know we we think
[31:26] about um
[31:30] how you know we know that music just
[31:33] some something as simple as music will
[31:35] bring Spirits into the room right you we
[31:36] know that the you know in the Bible the
[31:38] prophets you know called for music in
[31:40] order to prophesy we know that David
[31:41] played um music for Saul to drive away
[31:44] evil spirit we know that the wrong kind
[31:45] of music can bring an evil spirit into
[31:47] the room right and you know it's like
[31:51] and I know it's it's almost seems like
[31:55] overly I don't know I don't want to come
[31:57] off as legalistic but you know it's
[31:59] something as simple as this you know
[32:02] you're you know okay I'm going to watch
[32:04] the baseball game and there's look
[32:07] watching a baseball baseball is not
[32:10] lwd it's not it's nothing the game
[32:14] itself isn't all that
[32:15] bad but the ad reel that plays every
[32:19] minute and a half you know is some you
[32:24] know Ford Mustang ad with you know rock
[32:27] and roll guitar riff playing on it and
[32:30] it's like well okay that ad played for
[32:32] 30 seconds and for 30 seconds you just
[32:34] called demon Spirits into your
[32:36] house
[32:38] right and okay it was 30
[32:41] seconds but how many demon Spirits went
[32:44] into your home in that 30 seconds right
[32:46] okay it wasn't a million it was it was
[32:48] only 100 right it was only 50 it was
[32:51] only 25 cancer Spirits right it was only
[32:54] it was only 25 depression Spirits you
[32:56] know came into your home in that 30
[32:59] seconds and it's like
[33:02] well yeah you know maybe maybe if maybe
[33:06] if we're serious about this there
[33:08] shouldn't be any evil spirits coming
[33:10] into your house right maybe that number
[33:12] should be zero how are we supposed you
[33:15] know and I you know it's just it's just
[33:18] been on my heart you know that we should
[33:20] we shouldn't be we shouldn't be loose on
[33:22] these things we should be tighter on
[33:24] these things we should be we should be
[33:26] very careful with
[33:28] with how
[33:30] [Music]
[33:32] we you know like the Le in the in you
[33:36] know we talk about the token applying
[33:37] the token to the home yeah you could put
[33:39] you could put the blood over the
[33:41] doorpost circumcised man they did did
[33:43] everything right but if there was still
[33:44] leev in the home the blood over your
[33:46] door post meant nothing there was leaven
[33:49] in your home you know be very careful
[33:53] about what's in your home you you know
[33:56] when the when the death angel comes to
[33:57] knocking on your
[34:00] door you know you don't have a whole lot
[34:02] of ground to stand on to say there's
[34:05] blood over my door I've applied the
[34:07] token no the the blood over the doorpost
[34:10] wasn't was just simply an external
[34:12] indication that the leaven was out of
[34:13] the home so if there's no if there's
[34:15] Levan in your home if there's sin in
[34:16] your home if there's little carnal
[34:19] things poisoning the atmosphere of your
[34:22] home you're not going to have a whole
[34:24] lot of token Authority when the Devil
[34:25] comes knocking
[34:27] so we'll we'll end with that went over
[34:31] time a little bit let's stand and have a
[34:33] word of
[34:36] prayer father Lord I
[34:40] just trust that maybe something that I
[34:43] said would encourage somebody give
[34:46] somebody the little bit of encouragement
[34:48] Lord to press forward to rise a little
[34:50] bit higher to maybe avoid something that
[34:55] would displease you Lord that they would
[34:58] be stronger in the faith and father that
[35:01] grow their faith that they would be able
[35:02] to hold to the word that there would be
[35:04] no eliminating and laying aside all
[35:07] these voices that would naysay the word
[35:09] of God and to bring a a bad atmosphere
[35:13] around us father we ask that maybe
[35:17] something I would have said would bring
[35:18] an
[35:19] encouragement that it wouldn't be just
[35:21] simply my words Lord but maybe that it
[35:23] would spoke to somebody's heart and
[35:25] spoke to a need that they would have
[35:28] they could take it and go forward and
[35:30] meet the devil father on these this dark
[35:33] time we ask these things in Jesus name
[35:35] amen
