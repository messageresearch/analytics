TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so [Music] praise the lord good morning god bless you let's stand we'll look in back in our series in the book of revelation this will be revelation series part 13. amen just want to catch a single verse here um chapter 2 and verse 1. revelation chapter 2 verse 1. unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks amen let's pray father we are asking now for your divine favor we're asking that you come among us and teach us your word this morning to the class i'm grateful lord for those who were able to make it out this morning and i pray that you'll bless all of the services today this adult class the children's class the coming main service the baptismal service to follow lord we're your servants we're here lord to shine a light upon the things you have done in this day so may you help us now lord that's all we can do is approach you humbly with preparation lord in our hearts and minds ready we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless your friends you can be seated i'd like to just say again how much i have enjoyed uh this series and it's been a little bit of a dual thing for me because we're sharing it uh every morning online to a group of the brothers you all met brother esteban who was here with us the previous weekend and he's one of the regulars that we have on that class that we do every morning seven days a week even those brothers on the west coast they even want it on saturday and sunday i figured they would surely want a break but i suggested it even and i immediately unanimously got over overwhelmed with no no we want it seven days a week like so you're gonna get up at four in the morning on saturday and sunday yes absolutely so amen i think it's a marvelous thing but we were looking how that you know in our in our last time we finished off in part 12 with the brother branham referring to the the the great message of the second appearing of elijah he said from the statue of a perfect man we were ending with that how that the just live by faith said luther sanctification through wesley then come in brotherly kindness through laodicea and we believe of course he's meaning the brotherly kindness in the age of philadelphia and we believe the great message of the second appearing of elijah in the last day will sweep the land and of course it's not it's in one sense it's absolutely accurate what he said because we find that as it relates to the to the time of the age of the church then it certainly is um laodicea as an extension of or a continuation of philadelphia we found that the bride now here we are at the very tail end of laodicea and the light has gone out to the church age the age of the church and uh physically you know we're here in time but we also recognize a spiritual awakening that has happened in our day and that spiritual awakening is found in isaiah 60 and verse 2 for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee now interestingly enough and i didn't plan it this way but that's going to be my opening text for the regular service so go figure that's just the lord doing it that way so what we've been trying to do is to concentrate on the power behind the history we wanted to especially now we've spent a lot of time breaking down the revelation of jesus christ in chapter one we connected chapter one to chapter two spent a lot of time in that and we want to as i was went back to hear the exact part where i left off last time and i realized that we're just still not getting into the nuts and bolts of the verse by verse as it breaks down into the church ages so i want to do that today by the help of the lord so we've taken our first chapter two verse 1 unto the angel of the church of ephesus amen and so um let me make one quick check on something here um yeah okay so unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven candlesticks so when we talk about the power behind the history we are realizing that right right away that and i've pointed this out in previous lessons that god opens up every age and every message to every messenger in each age all seven of them and if you'll notice as we go along he he repeats things that he has said about himself in chapter one that's so that you can identify the power behind the history does it match the word because god's absolute is the word and so we realize that as we keep our mind straight on bible prophecy i want to make this point this morning this is a point that brother lonnie used to make a lot is that when we talk about bible prophecy that it's not it's not neces it's not necessarily or merely as if i would say it's not merely that god is looking down the stream of time and he can see everything that's going to happen and so he comes and puts it in a book that's not that's not bible prophecy bible prophecy is that god has a purpose and in order to accomplish that purpose he is going to lay out a path that humanity is going to follow and his power is going to be behind that prophecy to make that come to pass so it's not it's not just merely looking from his foreknowledge and saying well i see that this is going to happen it's not coming to the last day and say well i see that a bride makes it so let me go ahead and tell them you know i saw someone faithful and true no when he sees you as faithful and true in chapter 19 that the bride was found faithful that's because he determined that you're going to be found faithful and so we realize that god is never out of control and satan has never gained a victory i love saying that god has never been out of control and satan has never had a victory he has been defeated by god in fact is we find in the scripture that satan and i know he don't like to hear this this is going to burn him amen but i love saying it amen that he's just a tool in the hand of god just like we were saying last and last service you're a tool in the hand of god and kings and monarchs are tools in the hand of god the vatican is a tool russia is a tool amen communism is a tool in the hand of god i love realizing friends that you don't need to worry about anything god's in control and i know there's chaos in the world i get that we see it i see the same headlines you see but you know i'm going to tell you something friends god knows what it takes to get this church perfected and i wanna let me let's let's turn that in a little closer god knows what it's gonna take for you to be perfected so don't don't stress over the social upheaval don't stress over the political upheaval don't stress over the polarization and the hatred and the and the you know the all the terrible things that are going on listen we're not a part of that we're part of a different part of the word that's coming to pass not because the devil has been able to do anything but because god ordered it so and has allowed the devil so whatever's happening in your life just lean back on the bosom of the lord and say master i trust you for everything that i need in my life so god knows what we need to be perfected he knows what it's going to take to get the the character of the power behind the history there's a being behind that and he has a nature and he has a character and the the the the beauty of the godhead is that he has a body amen that's just like him the same as him that's what hebrews 13 8 promises promises us is that in that when jesus christ shows up in a form at the end time it'll be just like he's always been amen now we're not talking about his corporal return where we meet him in the air we're not talking about the time when he comes to the earth and revelation 19 we're talking about his life infused into his church right now and so you already are the body of the lord you already are part of the formula of his of his expression in the godhead and that's why brother branham could say she is him now he's not saying she's literally him he makes another statement you're the blood of god by the spirit but we realize that that i came into this world unlike jesus who was this his blood was a spoken word creation mine was not but you understand i had a gene of god in me that didn't come from my earthly parents that came from god and therefore when that's alive then i have had a spiritual blood transfusion and i'm no longer merely the son of ed and gene watkins i realize that i am now a part of the family of jesus christ so brother branham when he's drawing out the church ages he makes it makes it clear and feast of trumpets that he drew that that image by vision now that was refreshing for me this morning when i re-read that quote and feast of trumpets i'm going to read it for you because you know a lot of times if we're not careful we'll tend to think of the church ages as well that was prior to the seals and you know we've had to adjust it a little bit nothing doing that chart brother branham drew he drew it by vision watch what he says it's his 1964 feast of the trumpets now the hidden mysteries of christ was fully revealed in the seven seals it revealed first the seven church ages opened up the ages and placed them positionally both with history and with the bible and set them in position how they was and we found ourself in the last church age being the laodicean church age which was the most corruptible of all the church ages even from the very first from ephesians was a great church age and then how here the holy spirit giving me a vision and seeing what would take place i draw it on the blackboard two years ago here it is up here on the drawing that uh that how that the light was fading off of the earth which would be exactly the way the light come on the earth as the gospel and how it would fade in and out not knowing it at the time what it meant and how it would be when he preached it in the church ages he drew it according to a vision that's like moses when he built the tabernacle in the wilderness and god instructed him make sure you build it exactly like the one you saw in heaven and so we realized brother branham moving by a vision and then once the seals were open to us then it all began to disconnect dots in his mind and he he was he is here rejoicing friends because brother branham really is realizing with the opening of the seals he had not run in vain and he had not been crazy like they said he was and he was not full of the devil like they said he was and it never it puzzled him how they would say billy that's spiritualism that's of the devil and brother branham would say you know i could never figure out how could i be of the devil and love god so much i want to tell you something friends i don't always understand my life you don't always understand yours but here's one thing i can't deny i love him i love his word i love his righteousness i love his holiness i detest my weaknesses i detest my failures i did test when i come up coming up short i'm here to be the maximum version of me that god saw before the foundation of the world so we realize now that as god building it this way what he says unto the angel of the church of ephesus you can best believe there was going to be an angel to that church and god already had paul had already run his course and there was going to be a messenger to the second one and there was going to be to the third and there was going to be a message with that messenger and so here we are today friends you say well we've had a messenger in our day now you'd have a hard time not believing that since the supernatural so attended the ministry but many times the error that we find ourselves making is very catholic it's a very catholic error error and in that we we give all the attention to the messenger and we don't catch that he had a message and so a lot of times it becomes an idolatry which is contrary to the message he brought and we see that happening today and not to diminish the messenger because you can't diminish something god has done so i'm not i'm not here to diminish it and i don't need to defend that he does william branham doesn't need defending god defended him i don't need i don't i don't have to defend that i believe he was god's prophet if people don't want to believe it fine i do but what i want to concentrate on is what was the message why did he come and what message did he bring and that's because remember there's a power behind the history and when i get on the other side i want to look back and see the power that was behind my history amen so we realized that this is how god would do it now it's not entrapment a lot of times people can think of it that way but that is it that god entrapped because he's he determines these things beforehand but in it and beforehand but in every time he he offers uh them the opportunity to advance through the age uh that and and yet and yet he's done that since the fall in the garden of eden he offered cain away forward he's offered everyone a way forward he they they he knows who will take it and who won't but he doesn't force them to take it or not take it he just simply his foreknowledge knows who will and who won't and therefore but but when we talk about his elect family like a nun to abel because remember people who don't like the terminology to say there's there's humanity and there's an elect lady people don't like that but all i do is go back to the garden of eden and say well clearly cain was not of the same lineage as abel and that's very clear in the scripture so clear that a child could understand it now that's not god's fault that but god has allowed these things to come forward but just know this there is a power operating in your history there is a power operating in this church and you can rely on it i want you to know i know this age is wicked i know it's impossibly horrible but there's a power here friends i know that it seems hopeless and it seems wearying and it seems troubling and it is perplexing and it is unsettling but there's a power in control of it all so we realized then that you know he he he he looks you know we we we see how that you know god is aiming for something and so in the age here when he comes to open up this ephesian church age you'll notice that that as he's doing it unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things and he describes himself he that holdeth the seven stars which walketh in the in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and so we realize that in each age god is aiming at something and we're not going to get further than the first verse today but all the way down through you'll see how he describes himself describes the history describes what's going on warns them of what he sees coming and so in every age god is aiming at something and and that's you know that that that that that's where we differ because you know cain's choice ended up as a fatal choice judas the choice judas made was a fatal choice it was a choice he couldn't recover from and i'm here to tell you that the bride of christ makes a choice she can't recover from amen and it's not a fatal choice it's a glorious choice you say have you ever made a fatal choice i did i died one day and was reborn in christ and the decision i made for christ and i want to say to you today if you're going to make a decision for christ let it be a fatal one let it make sure you die don't just turn over a new leaf because that's not the image he's trying to get to in the history that's not the power behind the history that's not the that's not why the power behind the history came all right so the first age was aimed at and relaxed that's what ephesus meant and uh aimed at and relaxed and we can see why god had to rebuke this ephesian church age because they were they were aiming you know they were they were aiming remember aiming and then relaxed and so they're they're they're why is god rebuking them because they're aiming to be conformed to the image of christ that's what they were aiming at but they got relaxed in where the where the goal was they got relaxed in what it meant to accomplish that and so they they began to set the the goal marker to something less than what it had been in the upper room you understand as the age is moving on paul goes off the scene and john comes with a message to the church to say listen paul set you to aim to aim for the high calling and and you have that intention you believe you're aiming it and that's great you are aiming for it but here's a problem you're you're relaxing the standard you're relaxing the prayer you're relaxing the marker that says you've achieved it so you're not going as far you're not becoming as much as they were when they came out of the upper room and that's what it means aiming but relaxed see and so and of course the next stage is bitterness and dying per smyrna means bitterness and dying pergamus means married that's so fitting because you know it's if that's the age of pergamos where they married and then it was right after columba goes off the scene 606 comes and they they're fully put uh they're put away uh and divorced by christ because now they have fully chosen it's no longer a saying they've actually seated a false prophet and they put a crown on him and so he's now in the stead of jesus and therefore brother branham said that's it when israel done that and chose a king a human king over god being their king he put israel away when the church came and they they chose a human man to be a viker in the stead of christ which was the position the holy ghost was sent for and they made that a mortal man and put him on a throne and put a crown on his head and god said that's it you're you're married to that system and therefore you're an adulterous woman and i put you away in divorce so we find out but i don't want to get too far ahead of myself thyatira means lacks loose and lazy sardis means escaped ones philadelphia's brotherly love laodicea is people's rights boy do we know that all too well so we realize then that they're aimed at but they're relaxed in their goal and their and then and now things are starting to creep into the church things are starting to come into people's lives that water down and dilute what it means to be a real christian now you can see where 2 000 years of that has gotten us to so that today you drive by the the churches that are that were supposed to be like the upper room church amen and they're a million miles from the upper room experience not only do they not even have the same lifestyle they don't have the same power they don't have the same anointing they don't have the moving of the holy spirit and and and that's where it was going to end up once they ever started moving the goal post don't do that friends don't accept don't accept a watered-down version of of the life that this message was sent to turn you into see because you know i i've got i don't want to get into my sermon today but but one of the things that we're going to find in the main service is is god is we're becoming something excuse me and jesus would be back and the millennium would be on well you know by the time you reach smyrna hundreds of years have passed and really nothing has happened like that in fact is they don't realize it's going to be many more years before that millennium sets in and so they're beginning to to have a little bit of bitterness over their circumstances and you know i want you to remember that god is here the holy spirit is given to us to guide us to bring us to where god has desired us to be and so you know the we find that that their brother branham showed us here in these early in this early age how that there's there's two churches and one is walking in darkness and one is walking in light and the separator is that the false church which ironically claimed to be the real one the false church began to move toward an intellectual birth an intellectual confession an intellectual christianity but god while god starts in the mind brother branham brought this to us the word comes to your mind because there's where a battle has got to take place because the human mind is enmity against god but when the holy spirit in his grace and mercy begins to reveal the word to your mind then faith rises and it drops down 18 inches catches your heart and into your soul it becomes a soul birth not a mental birth see and so that was one of the factors that was going to separate so we have these two churches one goes for the mind one goes for the soul one is walking in theology and darkness and one is walking in revelation and light all right so and unto the angel of the church of all right now you know all manifestations of christ through the bible were christ by measure and we've we've labored a lot on this and i'm out of time now so i'm going to just pause right here with this statement but we realize that christ was being displayed all through the old testament even though it wasn't jesus of nazareth who was born of a woman amen but it but when jesus of nazareth was born he was the same person as the one in the old testament he wasn't another person and so we realized that he was revealing himself by measure so moses was christ in a measure joseph was christ in a measure right on down until it finally come to the fullness of the godhead bodily and that manifested in jesus christ now the book of revel the book of revelation starts out by saying the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him and so god was showing what the word is here to do in every age that the word this is why the revelation comes to continue the unfolding revelation of jesus christ so each age starts out as in revelation 2 1 unto the angel of the church every age opens with christ identifying in some manner that he identified him like that in every in every age so john is told to write to these churches he addresses it to the angel he not to the entire body but to the angel and he he sends that messenger to the church and the messenger brings his message all right i gotta close now he brings his message so he's a star in the right hand of god and he's the one who has the word for this age and that's why brother branham would say paul was the pastor of not just the ephesian church which in history he was for a short time but paul was the pastor to the whole age and therefore irenaeus was the pastor to the whole age all the way down until we come to the day and hour that we live in and god sent us a pastor amen and who who would have a ministry over over the five-fold ministry and and and that and that and that five-fold ministry has a solemn duty to take the message of the messenger and break it down as the messenger told them to do and feed it to the people he said of his own ministry i only have time to hit the highlights you men of god take it study it break it down and feed it to the people so i i trust that you're being well fed bethel tabernacle amen god bless you let's stand back to our feet i'm completely out of time let's pray father we thank you for your word this morning we ask that it be a living word to the people lord may it take root in our heart and may we see the purpose of god in in in revelation working in the midst of humanity may we see the power behind the history of our lives may we see the power behind our future may we see the power behind our day-to-day life lord and realize that we're becoming something because there's a power that has ordained it and an anointing that's driving it so master we commit ourselves into your hands in jesus name amen god bless you friends we'll see you shortly so [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] let us stand this morning amen let's just bow our heads as we open service in prayer precious father lord we humbly come before you lord just giving you all the thanks and honor lord lord you're so merciful unto us father lord lord we can't do nothing but just thank you father lord even the things that we don't understand or we can't explain we thank you lord because you know the beginning from the end lord we ask lord for your mercy lord in your grace now father lord anoint this service now father lord we've pressed our way here lord with so many things in our hearts so many things in our mind complications struggles we ask you now father lord to lift these burdens this morning father that we can entering to this service lord and give you praise
