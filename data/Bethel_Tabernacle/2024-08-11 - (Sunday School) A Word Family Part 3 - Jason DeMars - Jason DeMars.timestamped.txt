[5:09] morning everyone God bless you let's
[5:12] stand and we'll go directly to the word
[5:15] going to read
[5:17] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse
[5:22] 4
[5:24] Paul writing
[5:28] there and he says and ye fathers provoke
[5:31] not your children to wrath but bring
[5:34] them up in the nurture and admonition of
[5:37] the Lord Heavenly Father we just want to
[5:39] commit this time to you Lord I pray that
[5:40] you take your word Lord Make It live in
[5:43] our hearts father this this world and
[5:47] the culture that we live in and culture
[5:49] that everyone lives in around around the
[5:50] world is not for the word but it's
[5:55] against the word and Lord it it's
[6:00] necessary
[6:01] that that you by your spirit come and
[6:04] raise up a standard against it Lord so
[6:06] that we don't drift off into the ways of
[6:08] the world but that we would instead
[6:11] conform ourselves to the word no matter
[6:13] how difficult it is and and how uh um
[6:17] strange it might be to those around us
[6:19] or even
[6:20] impossible uh
[6:23] uh fiscally impossible based upon the
[6:26] systems of the world but with you
[6:28] there's nothing that's impossible and
[6:30] with you Lord a heart of that says yes
[6:34] to the word and walks in it you will
[6:36] always meet every need and you will
[6:40] always deliver many are the afflictions
[6:43] of the righteous but the Lord delivers
[6:45] them out of them all we thank you for
[6:47] that we ask it in Jesus name
[6:52] amen I want to continue part three on a
[6:57] word family and as we look and study
[7:01] this um I believe I believe just uh as
[7:06] as we
[7:07] start
[7:09] um our culture and the world around us
[7:13] is pushing us in a
[7:16] direction and and uh if if we're not if
[7:20] we don't search everything that we do by
[7:22] the scriptures and by the message we end
[7:25] up falling in line with what the word
[7:28] says now everybody every every body's C
[7:30] circumstance and situation is different
[7:33] and the leadership of the Lord is
[7:35] different and we have to follow the
[7:36] leadership of the Lord but we always
[7:37] remember that the leadership of the Lord
[7:39] takes us into the
[7:41] word he doesn't lead us contrary to the
[7:44] word at all if it's contrary to the word
[7:48] we know it's not God's leading so when
[7:51] we look at this God has brought to us a
[7:54] full restoration back to the original
[7:56] Faith so we can't continue the way the
[8:00] cissified
[8:01] denominational programs work where they
[8:05] are doing everything they can to
[8:07] amalgamate themselves to a world that
[8:09] hates them anyways yeah and so we're not
[8:12] here to try to please the world we're
[8:14] not here to try to make the message more
[8:17] palatable to the world we're here to dig
[8:20] right into what the prophet said what
[8:22] because the prophet is pointing us back
[8:24] to the scriptures and so I always looked
[8:26] at this verse you see God's speaking to
[8:30] fathers
[8:32] fathers bring your children up in the
[8:36] nurture and admonition of the Lord it it
[8:38] doesn't say hey mothers bring your
[8:40] children up in in the nurture and
[8:43] admonition of the Lord but many cultures
[8:46] say well the children are mother's
[8:49] domain the CH mother is responsible for
[8:52] the children father is going to go and
[8:54] provide for the family but I don't think
[8:56] that's what scripture is teaching us or
[8:58] showing us at all in fact the the onus
[9:02] and the responsibility is on
[9:04] fathers to bring up the children in the
[9:07] nurture and admonition of the Lord just
[9:09] as we talked about before when you look
[9:12] at the vi the the the vision that God
[9:15] gives a man has to have a vision God's
[9:17] vision for himself for his life and it's
[9:21] his duty to take Dominion amen now the
[9:24] Lord comes and by his grace provides a
[9:27] helper to the man to operate in that
[9:29] Vision so of course mother is involved
[9:32] but father has to have the vision and
[9:35] the direction and she helps in that
[9:38] vision and direction to bring the
[9:40] children up in the nurture and administ
[9:41] of the Lord but without the father's
[9:44] involvement there will be a real
[9:46] sickness in the children and in the
[9:48] family that they're going to require
[9:50] Supernatural healing for in the future
[9:53] in their life because father wasn't
[9:55] involved he just left it all to mother
[9:58] and again again it says
[10:01] children
[10:03] children so not just Boys the boys are
[10:06] for Dad and the girls are for Mom no the
[10:09] boys and the girls must be brought up in
[10:12] this way by their fathers in the nurture
[10:15] and admonition of the Lord so every
[10:18] father has to be a teacher say I'm I'm I
[10:21] don't have the gift of teaching I can't
[10:22] teach well get over
[10:25] it get over it because it's your duty to
[10:29] bring them up in the nurture and
[10:30] admonition of the Lord and that's
[10:32] impossible without teaching and
[10:36] training and and again we we spoke about
[10:39] it before but I feel like it's important
[10:40] to mention it is the father who provides
[10:44] the identity of the child it provides
[10:48] brings calls them into the mission that
[10:51] they have right
[10:54] so just as in the birth father provides
[10:57] the chromosome to deter determine
[11:00] whether it's a boy or a girl when
[11:02] bringing a child to maturity to manhood
[11:06] or Womanhood the father has to call them
[11:08] to their Destiny as well um and and you
[11:15] know for
[11:17] for for young people and for people
[11:19] growing up it's it's critical that the
[11:22] father is directly involved in calling
[11:25] their son from being a boy to a man if
[11:28] you just go by what the culture says and
[11:30] just let it sort of happen if you look
[11:32] around the world every culture has some
[11:35] sort of ceremony where they call a a a a
[11:40] boy a son to be a man or a daughter to
[11:44] be a woman in America in the western
[11:45] culture we've lost all of that and now
[11:49] we
[11:49] have men men that grow up they have the
[11:52] title of man but they don't they've
[11:55] never been told by their father that
[11:58] they're man so they're in their minds
[12:00] they're sitting there
[12:01] wondering who am I and the and the women
[12:05] are doing the same thing their father
[12:07] never said I love you you're beautiful
[12:11] you're a woman God has ordained you to
[12:13] be uh a mother a wife not in that order
[12:18] a
[12:19] housekeeper um he's he's called you to
[12:22] that and they're wondering what am I and
[12:26] that's you see the I identity crisis
[12:28] they think think they're maybe a
[12:30] cat or a lion or a dog or girls think
[12:35] they're boys boys think they're girls
[12:37] it's it's a crisis not of motherhood
[12:40] it's a crisis of
[12:42] fatherhood the father
[12:44] never knew who he was was never told who
[12:49] he was was never even okay so you were
[12:52] never told by your father failed okay so
[12:55] now you get to be an unhealthy
[12:56] individual the rest of your life no the
[12:59] Lord Jesus comes to bring healing he
[13:01] comes to enter right into your pain
[13:04] right into your suffering and say you're
[13:06] you're my son I'm calling you to manhood
[13:09] you're my daughter I'm calling you to
[13:11] Womanhood even if your father failed but
[13:14] how about we just bypass that and not be
[13:17] fathers that fail to call our sons to
[13:20] manhood and our daughters to
[13:22] Womanhood you know when your your
[13:25] daughter looks in the mirror and sees
[13:28] herself she doesn't actually see the
[13:32] reflection that is actually there you
[13:34] know what she sees she sees the
[13:36] reflection that the father puts in front
[13:39] of her that's what she sees and so if
[13:42] the father fails to put the right
[13:45] reflection there she's going to look and
[13:47] say I'm ugly I'm horrible I'm this I'm
[13:51] that and so and again it's never too
[13:54] late maybe you failed your whole
[13:57] life you can still go back back to your
[13:59] children and say I love you I'm with you
[14:02] I'm for you you're
[14:05] beautiful God has a purpose for you
[14:08] every child is longing for their parents
[14:11] to speak these words of life and
[14:13] blessing over them and so it starts with
[14:17] Dad it absolutely starts with Dad mother
[14:20] can do it mother can support and help
[14:22] but unless dad speaks the words over his
[14:25] children speaks the blessing you know
[14:28] Jacob wasn't coming to his mother for
[14:30] the
[14:32] blessing it had to be the father that
[14:35] gave him G gave the identity forward
[14:39] there all
[14:41] right I didn't have that planned but we
[14:44] thank the Lord
[14:47] so man the husband is the head of the
[14:52] home so sometimes we get a perverted
[14:55] idea and think that men in general are
[14:59] the leaders of women that's not what the
[15:01] scripture ever says just the husband is
[15:05] the head of the wife you as a as a as a
[15:08] as a lady as a female you're either
[15:10] under the headship of your father or
[15:13] you're under the headship of your
[15:16] husband the scripture of course says if
[15:18] if person's a widow or
[15:22] unmarried away they have their own
[15:25] household so and and the next scripture
[15:28] that we're going to read speaks about
[15:29] that but outside of those situations
[15:32] you're either under the headship of your
[15:34] dad or you're under the headship of your
[15:36] husband and the headship it's not just
[15:38] an ethereal thing in the Scripture it it
[15:42] designates specifically what that means
[15:45] what does it mean well let's read the
[15:47] scripture numbers 30 if a woman also vow
[15:50] a vow unto the Lord and bind herself by
[15:53] a bond being in her father's house in
[15:55] her Youth and her father hear her vow
[15:58] and her bond where with she hath bound
[15:59] her soul and her father shall hold his
[16:01] peace at her then all her vows shall
[16:04] stand and every Bond wherewith she hath
[16:05] bound her soul shall stand but if her
[16:09] father disallow her in that day that he
[16:11] heareth not any of her vows or of her
[16:14] bonds where with sheath bound her soul
[16:15] shall stand and the Lord shall forgive
[16:18] her because her father disallowed her
[16:21] and if she had it all and husband when
[16:23] she vowed or uttered ought out of her
[16:25] lips wherewith she bound her soul and
[16:27] her husband heard it and and held his
[16:29] peace at her in the day that he heard it
[16:31] then her vows shall stand and her bonds
[16:33] wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
[16:35] but if her husband disallowed her on the
[16:37] day that he heard it then he shall make
[16:38] her vow which he vowed and that which
[16:40] uttered with her lips wherewith she
[16:41] bound her soul of none effect and the
[16:43] Lord shall forgive her and I want to
[16:45] just speak that feminism's first line of
[16:48] attack was this scripture they wanted to
[16:51] do away with this this understanding is
[16:54] that the husband or the father is the
[16:57] deciding factor
[16:59] in the
[17:00] home he is the decision maker so
[17:03] headship without this becomes just an
[17:07] ethereal
[17:08] philosophy but when you understand that
[17:11] this is to be this is the husband is the
[17:15] final say in the home he's the final
[17:18] word our our our legal system doesn't
[17:21] follow the word but if you're
[17:24] Christians right we follow the word amen
[17:30] no amens okay so I'll say Amen to myself
[17:34] because I believe
[17:35] it and it's important that we
[17:39] understand the the correct I'm looking
[17:41] at my phone because I'm going to pull up
[17:42] a
[17:45] quote and as we as we look at these
[17:50] types of things again the world has
[17:54] their own system and program and we can
[17:57] get under the spirit of the world so
[17:59] that when we hear the word preached we
[18:01] become offended by the word isn't that
[18:04] sad that a Christian would become
[18:06] offended by the word because they've
[18:07] been so deceived by the
[18:09] culture it's it's it's so sad in the
[18:12] sermon is your life worthy of the
[18:15] Gospel he said now they got so that I
[18:17] was preaching the other night somewhere
[18:18] about women to obey their husbands
[18:21] obey yeah that went out of the marriage
[18:23] ritual a long time ago but they ain't
[18:25] going to do that no sir they live in
[18:26] America and they'll let you know so
[18:28] they're not going to obey but as long as
[18:30] you don't do it don't never try to call
[18:32] yourself a Christian because you're not
[18:35] I don't care how much you dance and
[18:36] speak with tongues if you don't obey
[18:38] your husband you're out of the will of
[18:40] God
[18:42] Amen that's the
[18:45] scripture and and we'll read it we'll
[18:48] read it later um if we get to it today
[18:50] probably not today but as we look as we
[18:54] look at this is this is what God's
[18:57] requirement this is a
[18:59] responsibility that's put upon the
[19:01] husband now again has it been abused has
[19:05] it been misused that's the Fallen world
[19:07] that we live in we're T talking about
[19:10] the abuse and misuse of it we can deal
[19:12] with that separately what we're talking
[19:14] about is this is what the word says the
[19:16] decision making person in the home is
[19:19] ultimately the father and I'll tell I'll
[19:22] say what I said before when a father
[19:24] abdicates his position when a husband
[19:26] abdicates his position even even if his
[19:29] wife is a feminist she will
[19:31] automatically begin to resent him she
[19:34] will not be upset she will make his life
[19:37] miserable because she will then take the
[19:40] authority and she'll resent him all the
[19:43] time for for not doing that not really
[19:45] being a
[19:47] man verse n but every vow of a widow and
[19:51] of her that is divorced wherewith they
[19:52] have bonded their souls shall stand
[19:54] against her and if she vowed in her
[19:56] husband's house or bound her soul by a
[19:57] bound with an oath and her husband heard
[19:59] it and held his peace at her and do
[20:00] allow her not then all her vows shall
[20:02] stand and every Bond wherewith she bound
[20:04] her soul shall stand even a dead
[20:07] husband that disallowed her gets to
[20:11] disallow
[20:12] her if she's a widow every vow and every
[20:15] binding oath to afflict the soul her
[20:17] husband May establish it or her husband
[20:19] may make it void but if her husband
[20:22] altogether hold his peace at her from
[20:24] from day to day then he establishes all
[20:26] her vows see abdicate abdicating his
[20:29] deciding factor so if he abdicates it
[20:32] her vows are are are bound and she's
[20:34] Bound by them in other words if he says
[20:37] nothing God confirms the oath see that's
[20:41] what he says he conf of all her bounds
[20:43] which are upon her he confirms them
[20:45] because he held his peace at her in the
[20:47] day that he heard them so even even so
[20:49] God designs that if the man keeps his
[20:52] mouth shut he's still the deciding
[20:54] factor in God's
[20:56] sight but if he shall any ways make them
[20:59] void after that he had heard them then
[21:01] he shall bear her
[21:03] iniquity
[21:06] amen these are the statutes which the
[21:08] Lord
[21:10] commanded which the Lord commanded Moses
[21:12] between a man and his wife between the
[21:14] father and his daughter being yet in her
[21:16] youth in her father's house all
[21:19] right so so again as we're looking at
[21:22] this God establishes an order in the
[21:26] home and in the family amen and if we're
[21:29] not ordering our you can be you can say
[21:31] I was ignorant of
[21:33] this that's fine you're not
[21:36] now and so we want to be found walking
[21:40] in obedience to the word no matter how
[21:43] much it skins us skins us down
[21:47] now next we understand from this that
[21:52] the father then is a guardian we spoke
[21:54] of that before uh in our first
[21:59] I think first or I don't know which one
[22:01] before we talked about it that when God
[22:05] put the garden together he told the man
[22:08] he was to dress it and to keep it and to
[22:11] keep it meant that he was to be to guard
[22:15] and so God made man to be a stronger
[22:17] vessel than a woman so that he could
[22:20] guard and keep the woman and his
[22:24] children and so when we realize that
[22:28] then it's the duty of the father to
[22:31] instruct his daughters in the word this
[22:35] is what the word says many times we have
[22:37] problems and we have homes out of order
[22:40] and we have families ruined and broken
[22:43] is because they've failed to show
[22:45] they're just letting feminism and the
[22:47] entertainment systems of the world raise
[22:49] their children and instead of showing
[22:51] your daughters hey your husband's the
[22:53] deciding factor your husband will be
[22:55] your head I am until the moment that I
[22:57] give you over to your husband you say
[23:00] man this guy takes a lot of authority
[23:02] and a lot the word says I'm supposed to
[23:04] do it you might not like it you might
[23:06] think I'm a jerk I literally don't care
[23:09] what you think because I'm not
[23:11] responsible to you you can jump in the
[23:15] lake if you want
[23:16] to because I am I'm literally going to
[23:19] do what the word says for my as for me
[23:21] in my house we will serve the Lord if
[23:23] the culture wants to throw me in the
[23:25] jail or kill me let him do it it's fine
[23:29] but I'm not going without a fight
[23:32] am so I you know God has ordained me to
[23:35] be the guardian and the protector of my
[23:38] family and he's ordained me to be the
[23:41] deciding factor for my family and I'm
[23:44] not going to have made many mistakes I
[23:46] will make more mistakes but I'm not
[23:49] going to uh uh leave my children and my
[23:52] wife to the world and to the
[23:56] devil and so re regardless of the of the
[23:59] costs I'm going to teach my daughters
[24:01] what the word says and I'm going to
[24:05] live as the word
[24:07] says that's why every boy should be on
[24:10] notice that if they want to talk to
[24:11] their my daughters they should talk to
[24:13] me first and if they go around me I will
[24:17] not I don't bear The Sword in
[24:20] vain
[24:22] amen we we have to take that authority
[24:25] of course you understand that the boy
[24:27] might end up being your son-in-law so
[24:30] you want to work with love and wisdom
[24:33] because you want a good relationship you
[24:35] know we we tease about sitting and
[24:37] cleaning your gun and so forth but I
[24:39] don't want to shoot any boys but if I
[24:41] have to I guess I
[24:44] will um and and that's the authority and
[24:47] that's the love that a father must have
[24:50] for their daughters to to know that hey
[24:53] dad's got my back dad's watching over me
[24:56] he's he's he's my guardian
[25:00] and
[25:02] uh we should teach men we should teach
[25:06] our daughters the three sacred trusts
[25:09] that brother Branham showed us in the
[25:12] invisible Union they should know this
[25:15] they should know what it is and know
[25:18] this is what God has entrusted them with
[25:21] and they're in God's sight they're holy
[25:23] God's sight they're
[25:25] sacred and he's given these specific
[25:29] things
[25:30] to women to keep now we'll go back and
[25:36] we'll get those look at the
[25:38] quotes So notice now we find that her
[25:41] body is the beding grounds and therefore
[25:45] it's a sacred trusts not to defile
[25:48] that so it's the father's duty to work
[25:53] together
[25:54] with the mother to teach them about
[25:57] their body
[25:59] to teach them about the function of
[26:00] their body and to teach them what it's
[26:03] for in God's sight and that shouldn't
[26:06] beut be a mystery to them the day they
[26:08] get getting engaged or married or it
[26:11] shouldn't be training for them from
[26:13] their friends or from searching Google
[26:16] and looking at filthy stuff it's the
[26:19] parents duty to help your children to
[26:23] understand these sacred trusts your body
[26:25] is a betting ground it's the place to
[26:27] bring forth life and it's sacred it's to
[26:31] be kept holy and pure and
[26:34] undefiled and then when you get married
[26:37] even then the Bible says the marriage
[26:39] bed is
[26:41] undefiled even even after that changes
[26:45] at the marriage bed go in God's sight
[26:48] you have kept yourself undefiled and you
[26:50] not been defiled you're using your body
[26:53] for the purpose that God wants you to
[26:55] use it for that he designed you for and
[26:57] so so don't defile that before the hour
[27:00] that it's in God's
[27:06] season by her Lord a certain virtue
[27:10] nothing else holds it but a woman right
[27:12] that's committed to her by God she must
[27:14] not defile that
[27:17] virtue amen it think it sounds like
[27:19] we're saying the same thing but as we
[27:21] look at it you'll see that he's he's
[27:23] developing on that the third one now we
[27:26] find out that she has been given the sa
[27:28] trust that she must not break it of
[27:30] Womanhood act have her character raise
[27:33] her children be honorable to her husband
[27:37] so what are the three sacred
[27:39] trusts what are what what are they one
[27:43] your body it's the betting ground keep
[27:46] it pure and undefiled two
[27:50] virtue virtue means what strength right
[27:55] Jesus said virtue has gone out of me so
[27:57] it's its strength its power has gone
[28:00] gone out so what is a woman's strength
[28:02] and
[28:03] power it's your ability to say yes or no
[28:08] your ability to say to that boy
[28:13] no no this is for God's timing and God's
[28:17] purpose amen three he says Womanhood
[28:21] it's the character and conduct to your
[28:24] children and husband so again your body
[28:29] your virtue and your character of
[28:32] Womanhood and so these are the things
[28:34] that
[28:36] fathers have to establish in their home
[28:39] with their
[28:40] daughters it's it's again it isn't mom's
[28:44] ultimate responsibility it's Dad's
[28:47] responsibility to be sure that the
[28:49] understanding is there and Mom is there
[28:52] as the helper of the father's vision and
[28:56] again it's not men it's not up to us men
[28:59] to determine what our own vision is
[29:02] number one is we have a pre-existing
[29:04] Vision given to Adam at the very
[29:07] beginning number two is then we have a
[29:10] specific
[29:11] calling each one of us has for what we
[29:15] are to do in our life but nevertheless I
[29:18] can tell you all with confidence other
[29:21] than a very very small few that God has
[29:24] ordained to be uh Unix for the kingdom
[29:26] of God that's a that's a minimal amount
[29:29] of people for most people they're going
[29:31] to be called and ordained to take
[29:34] dominion and to multiply and fill up the
[29:37] Earth it's pretty full now but God has
[29:41] not sent Christ back to end the vision
[29:45] and SEC and the other part of it is as
[29:46] well is that many times we look at this
[29:49] and we we have a Rapture mentality you
[29:52] think well that's a good thing isn't it
[29:54] well yes and no because the prophet
[29:58] dealt with people that were that were
[30:01] that were thinking when the seals are
[30:02] done being preached the Rapture will
[30:04] take place they're selling everything
[30:05] and moving and becoming Fanatics and he
[30:08] wants to emphasize when he's preaching
[30:09] the seals live a good clean Godly
[30:12] Christian Life right so what did he tell
[30:16] us if I knew if I was planting potatoes
[30:19] and I knew the Rapture was going to take
[30:21] place to tomorrow I would plant potatoes
[30:25] today so keep planting potatoes yeah
[30:29] keep taking dominion and multiplying
[30:32] this is what God wants us to do where
[30:34] does that Dominion start right in our
[30:38] family that's the that's the that that
[30:40] is the that's the primary calling of
[30:44] every
[30:44] man you say no so some people are called
[30:47] to preach that's their primary calling
[30:50] no because if he can't lead his family
[30:54] he cannot
[30:55] preach that's part of the qualif if
[30:58] ation of being able to stand behind the
[31:00] pulpit and preach the
[31:02] word and so without leading your family
[31:05] properly you become disqualified so it
[31:07] shows us a man's first responsibility is
[31:11] his own family if his family is falling
[31:13] and dying spiritually he should get
[31:16] himself out of the pulpit and figure out
[31:18] a way to be with his family and make
[31:20] sure that they're taken care of they're
[31:22] provided for and that they're nurtured
[31:24] and raised up in the admiss admonition
[31:26] of the Lord too many ministers and quote
[31:29] unquote missionaries are going out
[31:31] ruining their families and say well I
[31:33] can't I can't be disobedient to my
[31:35] calling you already
[31:36] were you already were you you you you
[31:40] destroyed your your your second calling
[31:44] by not following through with your first
[31:45] calling and I know we all we all make
[31:48] mistakes I do too and it's only by the
[31:51] grace of God that any of us but we we
[31:54] should remember
[31:55] fathers and mothers that you know the
[31:59] statement of I believe it's Charles
[32:01] Spurgeon says that if a sinner is going
[32:04] to go to hell then let it be that they
[32:08] have to crawl over my dead and lifeless
[32:12] body to get there so we say that for
[32:15] somebody 7,000 miles away in Africa but
[32:19] what about our own
[32:21] children they should have to leap over
[32:23] our dead bodies into into the pit of
[32:26] Hell before they can get there because
[32:29] we've put all our efforts and we've said
[32:31] you know what Satan you can't have them
[32:33] I don't care what you do what you do to
[32:36] me how much you light me on fire I am
[32:39] going after my kids and I am not it's
[32:43] not going to be for a lack of effort am
[32:46] on my part you say well it's just
[32:48] predestinated seat of God yes it is and
[32:51] yet how many kids have been destroyed
[32:53] because their parents have abdicated
[32:55] their position as in spiritual teach
[32:57] teaching and
[32:59] Leadership why should our children have
[33:01] to suffer because we're
[33:03] fools and we think our primary
[33:05] responsibility is to go to church and to
[33:07] just preach and do Mission strips it's
[33:09] not our primary responsibility it's not
[33:12] our first calling it's not our first
[33:14] position it's not it's your
[33:18] home it's your children fathers provoke
[33:21] not your children to wrath but raise
[33:24] them up in the fear and admonition of
[33:27] the
[33:28] Lord and and again God has made a man
[33:32] the deciding factor in his
[33:35] home he's not to you say oh man this
[33:38] this is sure anti-feminism yes it is I
[33:42] will fight that evil spirit till the day
[33:44] that I die because it's ruining churches
[33:46] it's ruining families it's ruining lives
[33:50] and that Spirit has creeped into the
[33:52] minds of message
[33:54] Believers why should I go to a church
[33:57] and preach this and feel so much angst
[34:00] coming against
[34:03] me and it's not just in the atmosphere
[34:05] it's people's
[34:06] faces that are upset and frustrated
[34:09] about it why because the spirit of
[34:11] feminism has con gone in into your
[34:14] spirit and you need to be we need to be
[34:16] delivered from this thing we're raising
[34:19] our children just like the world says
[34:22] not for what the word says we're making
[34:23] the word secondary and and and what the
[34:26] world says primary
[34:28] we're putting our daughters into a
[34:30] direction that the Lord hasn't put
[34:33] putting our wives into places the Lord
[34:36] hasn't put them because why because you
[34:40] by faith men a woman out of order shows
[34:44] a man out of order it's it can't be in
[34:47] any other way because he's too cissified
[34:49] to stand up to his wife and say this is
[34:51] how it's going to be not with a fist
[34:54] with love but determination and say as
[34:56] for me in my house we will serve the
[34:58] Lord honey you're serving the lord oh no
[35:00] but I want to do this you're not when a
[35:04] when whenever brother branam blames
[35:07] women for cutting their hair wearing
[35:08] makeup being immodest he goes to the man
[35:11] and says shame on you men for being such
[35:13] a
[35:14] that you can't control what your
[35:17] wife is
[35:20] doing this is the condition that we've
[35:23] found ourselves in around the message
[35:26] we've become allow feminism to sissify
[35:29] the men and allowed the women to take
[35:32] over but a man has to abdicate that
[35:36] because he's the stronger
[35:37] vessel he's less he's less able to be
[35:41] deceived see that's
[35:44] scripture the world might not like it
[35:46] you might not like it but I don't care
[35:48] it's exactly what the word says let's
[35:51] forget about the worldly system and
[35:54] worldly order that says we must raise
[35:56] our family like
