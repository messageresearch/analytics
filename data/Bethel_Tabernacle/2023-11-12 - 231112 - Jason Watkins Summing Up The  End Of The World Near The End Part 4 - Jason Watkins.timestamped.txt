[38:54] your salvation you have a right to amen
[38:57] don't let the devil take that Joy from
[38:59] you amen God bless you we're going to
[39:01] invite you
[39:03] to
[39:06] um just a second have a
[39:10] seat amen I want to give um a little bit
[39:15] of an update
[39:17] extended testimony before I go to the
[39:20] word and it's what I'm saying today will
[39:24] likely have to be updated again because
[39:26] it's it's it's under active um it's it's
[39:30] kind of Galloping
[39:32] forward but um I've had a lot of
[39:35] questions uh both domestic and foreign
[39:37] from overseas
[39:39] Brothers asking me uh concerning the
[39:43] sharks swimming in the May building in
[39:47] Downtown Los Angeles amen uh This was um
[39:51] not something that brother Brandon
[39:52] prophesied and told on tape but it's a
[39:54] personal testimony of brother Billy
[39:58] Paul and testimony was that there he
[40:02] wouldn't be an old man before sharks
[40:04] would swim in and out of that
[40:07] building so that you know that and I and
[40:10] that has kind of went around because now
[40:12] that brother Billy has went on to be
[40:13] with the Lord and uh we have known for
[40:16] years that that prophecy was fulfilled
[40:19] in the early 1970s amen now In fairness
[40:24] to brother Billy I asked him about that
[40:26] and they he he didn't have a um an
[40:30] agreement or disagreement that that was
[40:33] the Fulfillment of it but he didn't
[40:35] really know he said you know and I said
[40:37] you know and I there's a quite a
[40:38] backstory to it but I I'll just I just
[40:41] kind of want to give a fresh testimony
[40:45] while it's being streamed on the
[40:47] internet today because I've been asked
[40:49] about it a number of times and brother
[40:53] Tim puit some time ago gave a little um
[40:57] little kind of a synopsis of it and uh
[41:00] so I want to give a little bit more
[41:02] detail
[41:03] today um there is somewhat of a
[41:07] backstory that I will need to tell you
[41:11] because I I sat down with brother Billy
[41:14] personally and asked him about this some
[41:16] years ago quite a number of years
[41:18] ago um probably more than a couple
[41:21] decades ago and we were talking about it
[41:24] and I asked him about that story
[41:26] of his dad saying to him Billy where are
[41:29] you standing I'm in front of the May
[41:31] building downtown Los Angeles you won't
[41:34] be an old man before shark swim so
[41:36] brother Billy said to me he said now
[41:38] there's a little bit of a you have to
[41:40] understand what's behind that and what
[41:42] had been behind that which actually ends
[41:45] up making it even more confirmed um is
[41:49] that when brother brandham began the
[41:52] Lord spoke to him concerning sister
[41:55] Florence shakarian you remember brother
[41:57] Deus sharan sister and that uh brother
[42:01] brandham saw in a vision that she was
[42:04] she was uh sick and not going to live
[42:07] and that the Lord was bringing her home
[42:09] there was nothing wrong as far as why
[42:11] the Lord did that it was just her time
[42:13] and the Lord was bringing his daughter
[42:15] home she has a wonderful brother
[42:17] brandham said a wonderful Christian
[42:19] sister and brother brandom at first
[42:21] thought that he you know you can hear
[42:23] him on tape he said I I knew she wasn't
[42:25] going to be he he said but I just
[42:27] couldn't tell Deus I he couldn't bring
[42:29] himself to do it but eventually brother
[42:31] brandham did let it be known thus sayith
[42:34] the Lord that she was not going to live
[42:36] she was going to die and that she would
[42:38] die at 4 a.m. in the morning 4:00 in the
[42:41] morning and she would go quietly and
[42:45] peacefully well sometime after that
[42:48] brother Billy began to relate how that
[42:50] they were in meetings and and and there
[42:54] began to be prophecy moving through that
[42:57] Pentecostal Gathering and concerning
[43:00] sister Florence sharan and they began to
[43:05] testify you know people falling and
[43:07] speaking in tongues uh you know to the
[43:10] effect of in brother Billy's words that
[43:13] was to the effect of you shall not die
[43:16] God hath heard your prayers and you
[43:18] shall live thus sayeth the Lord and
[43:21] that's not uncommon for that to happen
[43:22] you remember in the days of Jeremiah
[43:24] when Jeremiah prophesied concerning
[43:27] Israel going into captivity for 70 years
[43:29] and another Prophet who was a real
[43:32] Prophet see now bear in mind you you can
[43:37] be a real Prophet that doesn't
[43:39] necessarily make you a true Prophet yeah
[43:41] amen you can be a real one balum was a
[43:45] real one but he wasn't a true one and
[43:47] Hanah was a real one but he wasn't a
[43:49] true one because he prophesied contrary
[43:52] to the words of Jeremiah and said
[43:54] they'll only be there to you years when
[43:56] Jeremiah had said 70 years and Jeremiah
[44:00] didn't argue with him he just said amen
[44:02] so be it let the Lord perform your words
[44:04] but remember there was a prophet before
[44:07] us my Prophet matches him because that
[44:10] was the prophecy of Elijah concerning
[44:12] the king of Israel and and what would
[44:15] happen to them and so we know that
[44:17] Jeremiah compared his prophecy to
[44:21] Jeremiah compared Rema to logos yeah
[44:24] amen amen amen we're going to continue
[44:27] in that today amen so Jeremiah's Rema
[44:30] was compared to the logos which was the
[44:32] established word and that the logos now
[44:36] that the that Elijah had prophesied was
[44:38] now that anointing falling on Jeremiah
[44:41] and that word became Rema same word but
[44:44] now it's living in flesh again yeah and
[44:46] it's going
[44:48] forward so when they began to prophesy
[44:52] that sister Florence would not die the
[44:54] Lord had heard her prayer something to
[44:56] that
[44:57] effect um the meeting concluded and the
[45:00] next day as I remember brother Billy
[45:02] telling me they were walking down the
[45:04] street in Los
[45:06] Angeles down apparently I'm assuming it
[45:09] would be Broadway because that's where
[45:11] the May building is located and we find
[45:15] that South on South Broadway and we find
[45:18] that Billy told me that brother Billy
[45:20] told me that he was very upset in his
[45:24] spirit and he said you could never never
[45:26] hide that from Daddy you couldn't hide
[45:27] anything from him and as we're walking
[45:29] along he said I and just as a sidebar
[45:33] Perry green testified one time that um
[45:36] he had troubled about something and
[45:38] brother brandom called him and told him
[45:40] what he was troubled about and you know
[45:41] don't worry about it said said brother
[45:43] Perry don't worry if if if you if you
[45:47] you know if uh if there's anything wrong
[45:50] I'll call you brother Perry said imagine
[45:52] living under that for two
[45:54] years there's anything anything wrong
[45:56] I'll call you and so uh so he says you
[46:01] know Billy what's wrong brother Billy
[46:03] told me he tried to blow it off and say
[46:05] Oh Daddy nothing and he said Paul and he
[46:08] said no whenever he called me Paul he
[46:10] was serious he wasn't it wasn't dad
[46:12] anymore this was a different gear and he
[46:15] said Paul what's
[46:17] wrong and brother Billy knew he couldn't
[46:20] hide it and he said well
[46:22] Daddy in that meeting you know you you
[46:26] all those people were saying she's going
[46:27] to live and the Lord has heard her
[46:29] prayers and it's going to be great and
[46:31] the people were rejoicing and you just
[46:33] sit there you didn't say a
[46:35] word and and and brother brandham said
[46:38] to him said Paul I already told them
[46:44] what God told me there's no need to say
[46:47] it different no need to repeat it no
[46:50] just like when they come to Jesus and
[46:52] said okay now tell us plainly no more
[46:54] Parables no more messing around who are
[46:57] you just just say
[47:01] it there's not a new answer there no new
[47:04] revelation I'm the same one I already
[47:06] told you who I am and you didn't believe
[47:09] me you didn't believe John you didn't
[47:11] believe me you don't believe me now so
[47:14] so he said I he said Paul I already told
[47:17] them what the Lord said to me there's no
[47:20] need to debate and argue with them if
[47:23] that's what they believe now uh he he
[47:26] and he and he said and and he said Paul
[47:30] where are you and brother Billy knew
[47:33] this was a different kind of a
[47:35] moment and he at first he said I didn't
[47:38] know what Dad meant what do what do you
[47:41] mean where am I I'm on the street no
[47:45] Paul where are you and brother Billy
[47:49] confessed to me that he actually felt a
[47:51] little bit of frustration not irritation
[47:54] at all but but a little bit like I don't
[47:56] know what are you what are you asking I
[47:58] what do you mean where am I he's like
[48:00] and he said so I just I just
[48:04] went I'm standing in front of the May
[48:06] building in Downtown Los
[48:09] Angeles and brother brandham just
[48:12] said that you just for you Billy as a
[48:16] confirmation about what I said about
[48:18] sister
[48:19] Florence the same one that told me that
[48:22] sister Florence will pass away at 400
[48:25] a.m.
[48:26] the same one who told me about sister
[48:28] Florence tells me to tell you now you
[48:32] won't be an old man before sharks will
[48:34] swim in and out of that
[48:37] door and he came out of it and they
[48:39] walked on and I said so brother Billy do
[48:44] you think and I asked the question
[48:45] everybody wanted to ask I said do you
[48:49] think that cuz by the time I'm talking
[48:51] to him he's already an old man and I
[48:53] said do you think it's possible
[48:56] that brother Brandon meant you would
[48:58] have crossed over hence you'd be in a
[49:00] young body and hence you wouldn't be an
[49:03] old
[49:03] man and brother Billy said to me he said
[49:06] brother Jason I I don't know the answer
[49:09] to that he said all I can do is tell you
[49:13] that at the time he told it to me I
[49:16] didn't take it that way that's not
[49:19] that's not what I took him to mean I
[49:22] took him to mean at that moment he said
[49:25] now if that that's how it turns out
[49:26] that's how it turns out but all I'm
[49:28] telling you is that's not how it struck
[49:30] me I didn't think that was his meaning
[49:33] at the time that I wouldn't be an old
[49:36] man before it would actually
[49:39] happen and so and then of course sister
[49:42] Florence did just a little while later
[49:45] wasn't very long after that all of those
[49:47] false prophecies proved false and
[49:50] brother bram's word proved true while
[49:53] he's in the meeting he got a note sister
[49:55] FL lawence has passed away and he sent
[49:57] the man back to say go call him back and
[49:59] ask them what time and they went and
[50:01] called sure enough for in the morning
[50:03] she slipped away and it was confirmed
[50:07] 100% so now we deal with this
[50:11] situation where what brother Billy is
[50:14] told by his dad in the name of the Lord
[50:16] it was no doubt about it it was told to
[50:18] him as Prophecy in the name of the Lord
[50:21] so we first found out and I I heard
[50:24] brother Ronald Dean speak
[50:26] testified that in the 1970s when he was
[50:30] young that his mom and dad brother
[50:32] Charlie who I knew and his mother who I
[50:34] knew very well knew them since a a child
[50:38] a te a young teenager I knew his parents
[50:40] and and knew of them and then got to
[50:43] meet them and they were wonderful
[50:44] Christian people brother Charlie was the
[50:46] pastor there in Christiansburg for years
[50:49] and he's went on to be with the Lord now
[50:51] and brother Ronald Dean testified that
[50:53] they were listening to the radio in the
[50:58] kitchen and they were listening to Paul
[51:00] Harvey news everybody half the world
[51:02] listened to Paul Harvey because he
[51:04] always had these little weird news
[51:06] stories you'd never hear in the
[51:08] mainstream and he had a way a you know
[51:11] Homespun way and people liked him I
[51:13] remember hearing him as a child there's
[51:15] actually repositories with some of his
[51:18] uh his his radio shows he is nationally
[51:21] syndicated and he started telling a
[51:23] story that brother Charlie brother and
[51:26] sister Spencer both witnessed that he
[51:29] told a story in the 70s about how that
[51:34] there had been flooding in the downtown
[51:37] area of Los Angeles and that sharks had
[51:40] been seen in the water in the May
[51:43] building yeah and they heard that
[51:46] listening to his radio broadcast they
[51:48] heard it with their own ears and they
[51:49] turned to each other then and said
[51:51] there's BR there's what brother Bram
[51:53] said to brother Billy and in the and in
[51:55] the 1970s Billy was not an old man see
[51:59] and so so then that that that we were in
[52:03] the fellowship hall probably some years
[52:05] ago maybe I would say seven or eight
[52:07] years
[52:08] ago and um um was that didn't he think
[52:13] brother George brother thought it about
[52:14] seven years ago we were talking yeah
[52:17] yeah that's right we were in the
[52:18] fellowship hall talking and uh you
[52:21] remember when Brother Gary Hall and
[52:22] sister Jan Hall were here and brother
[52:23] Gary was our lead guitarist sister Jan
[52:26] played rhythm guitar and we got talking
[52:28] about that and Gary said that his older
[52:31] sister Bonnie had worked in the May
[52:33] building yeah and we wondered out loud I
[52:37] wonder if she would have a recollection
[52:38] of that and he said well she worked
[52:40] there in the 70s I know that he said I
[52:43] could I could find out so I said Brother
[52:45] Gary do that so the next thing we know
[52:48] is that Brother Gary and sister Jan came
[52:50] back to report that he had talked to his
[52:53] sister and and he and and sister Jan
[52:55] were witnesses that she remembered it
[52:59] precisely and she remembered it
[53:01] specifically Brother Gary says and I
[53:03] have his recorded testimony that and I'm
[53:06] going to I'm going to post that but that
[53:08] the reason she remembered it so much is
[53:11] because he said I hate to say it but my
[53:13] sister cared about money she was you
[53:16] know she was she knew certain people in
[53:18] the Hollywood area she was kind of in
[53:20] those circles she was the second highest
[53:22] ranking officer they actually wanted her
[53:25] to be the manager of the May Company but
[53:28] their mandate in the 1970s prescribed
[53:31] that it had to be a man and so they made
[53:33] her the second ranking officer and and
[53:37] fi come to find out the reason she
[53:39] remembered it so vividly is because she
[53:42] didn't miss work because if she missed
[53:44] work she lost money and she remembered
[53:48] she said I went to work on a on on he
[53:51] said what year was it she said it was
[53:53] 1974 she remembered it crystal clear and
[53:57] brother Gary and sister Jan both
[53:59] witnessed this to me she remembered it
[54:02] vividly said yeah I I drove to work that
[54:04] day and that when I when I went to go
[54:07] into the underground parking lot to my
[54:09] parking space there were guards stopping
[54:12] everybody and they stopped me and said
[54:14] you can't go in because the whole lower
[54:17] part is all flooded the basement the
[54:19] parking everything is your car first of
[54:22] all your car will flood out it's deep
[54:24] and we have actually seen sharks
[54:27] swimming in the
[54:28] water and it turns out that that her
[54:32] testimony
[54:34] was that it had something to do she
[54:37] remembered that it had something to do
[54:39] with storm drain backup now their their
[54:42] drains their storm drains drained into
[54:45] the
[54:45] ocean and so because that there had been
[54:49] some for some reason she couldn't
[54:50] remember a backup that actually see
[54:55] water had rushed into the city through
[54:57] the drain through the what had been
[54:59] supposed to go that way and had flooded
[55:02] the area and water invaded the buildings
[55:04] in that area of Broadway and the May
[55:07] building was flooded and marine life
[55:09] from the ocean including sharks had been
[55:11] seen swimming in the water and she
[55:16] absolutely testified to it that it was
[55:18] 100% Tru she remembered it vividly in
[55:23] 1974 now
[55:26] um is that accurate Brother George how
[55:28] I'm relating that now there's there's
[55:32] another detail you should know brother
[55:34] George after was standing there hearing
[55:37] Brother Gary give us that testimony
[55:39] yesterday because I went back I wanted
[55:40] to get it from him
[55:42] fresh and and and we and when he gave us
[55:46] the testimony brother George actually
[55:49] went onto a government website
[55:53] weather.gov and he and and he found
[55:57] where the government weather website
[56:01] tracks I didn't know they did it they
[56:03] track these kinds of of flooding or any
[56:06] kind of thing to do in nature and they
[56:09] and he he he narrowed it down to
[56:11] Southern California and turns out
[56:14] brother George uncovered an entire PDF
[56:17] released by the government that dated
[56:19] all the way back into the 1800s didn't
[56:21] it brother George I think it started
[56:22] where they started tracking it and they
[56:25] literally had every kind of weather
[56:26] anomaly that had struck that area and as
[56:29] I'm scrolling down I'm looking and I
[56:32] knew brother George had sent it to me
[56:33] for a reason and I came down to 1974 I
[56:37] think there were three instances in
[56:40] 1974 and was it March in March
[56:46] 1974 they had severe heavy rains that
[56:50] had caused the storm drains to back up
[56:54] and water had had flowed in reverse and
[56:57] blew 200 lb manhole covers off in the
[57:00] streets as water rushed
[57:03] forward and so now we actually have a
[57:06] government website
[57:08] correlating Bonnie's testimony that it
[57:11] was in
[57:12] 1974 and that she was told sharks were
[57:15] in the water and Paul Harvey reported
[57:19] the story and Billy Paul says his daddy
[57:22] told him that in the 1960s I'm here to
[57:25] tell you something friends that prophecy
[57:28] was 100% fulfilled Amen in
[57:32] 1974 and Billy was not an old man so you
[57:36] know I I I'm I'm not needing to convince
[57:39] any of us as Believers but I just like
[57:42] being able to correlate and see these
[57:44] things and God has caused them who knew
[57:47] that the government kept that kind of
[57:48] detailed
[57:50] records that it act and now and then
[57:53] here's something else brother George
[57:54] that you didn't know so this morning I
[57:57] looked at the address of the May
[58:00] building on South
[58:01] Broadway and I look and I had formerly
[58:04] looked at the address of the azuza
[58:07] Revival did I preach it yet here about
[58:10] when I was telling you all I can't
[58:11] remember I know I've taught it somewhere
[58:13] where brother brandham constantly talked
[58:16] about you know I don't think this was
[58:18] his word cuz but it he talked about God
[58:22] is going to sink Hollywood you that it
[58:25] says and he he he emphasized that it
[58:27] cabbaged down on like Hollywood would be
[58:30] the epicenter he said God because it's
[58:32] all heaped up on the west coast we used
[58:34] to get our Fashions from Paris yeah I
[58:36] remember preaching here now and now we
[58:39] he said now they come to us because it's
[58:41] Hollywood and and he says God is going
[58:44] to sink Hollywood that's why he's going
[58:46] to do it because of the filth that has
[58:48] went around the world from Hollywood and
[58:50] it's heaped up to
[58:53] where again and that's the gospel going
[58:56] to go back to the Jews so in in in one
[59:00] type all right now so so I you remember
[59:04] I told you that I measured where the
[59:07] seventh Church age Revival started in
[59:10] ausa yeah and I've been on Aza Street
[59:13] and I went and I pinpointed it on maps
[59:16] Apple Maps and Google Maps and they both
[59:18] and you remember I told you that from
[59:21] where the Holy Ghost fell on isua Street
[59:23] to Hollywood was seven miles seven not
[59:27] six not eight
[59:28] seven well I tested where Broad Street
[59:32] where the May building was and it was
[59:34] actually over respectively it was just
[59:38] up and over but both of them to
[59:41] Hollywood are exactly seven miles
[59:46] amen right where a prophecy goes forward
[59:49] sharks swim right here and we all
[59:51] thought it was because of the California
[59:52] earthquake it wouldn't have anything to
[59:53] do with that but God is going to sink
[59:56] that and both that Prophecy of the May
[59:58] building and where the isus of Revival
[1:00:01] fell are exactly 7even miles to
[1:00:04] Hollywood I want to tell you something
[1:00:05] friends you can't make that stuff up
[1:00:07] that's not an accident God is in control
[1:00:11] of everything do you believe
[1:00:13] it amen I want to have that on on record
[1:00:17] so uh God bless you whoever will will
[1:00:20] see this you're welcome to share it with
[1:00:22] whomever let's stand back to our feet
[1:00:25] and I want to invite you to Revelation
[1:00:28] 21 and I'm I'm going to do better this
[1:00:31] Sunday than I did last
[1:00:33] Sunday I have to now that I've taken up
[1:00:36] a lot of my time with the
[1:00:37] testimony I just want to go a little
[1:00:40] further and I I've got I'll have at
[1:00:42] least two more parts to it so uh if
[1:00:46] you've missed any of the parts go back
[1:00:47] and get them today should be part four
[1:00:50] Revelation 219 and I'm going to try
[1:00:53] today to do my best in impression of
[1:00:55] brother Harold Becket and who just
[1:00:57] speaks in a nice evening doesn't really
[1:00:59] get excited and and and because I've
[1:01:03] paid stop
[1:01:05] [Laughter]
[1:01:07] laughing and so so I I I I've paid a
[1:01:12] price all week um with with a swelling
[1:01:16] feeling in my eye but I appreciate
[1:01:17] brother Luther's prayer this morning and
[1:01:19] uh you should know that I have claimed
[1:01:21] my complete deliverance of it and I not
[1:01:24] change that I'm absolutely going to be
[1:01:27] free of it completely absolutely and
[1:01:30] everything about my eye is going to go
[1:01:31] back to previous levels Lord amen amen
[1:01:35] praise the Lord Amen Brother John we're
[1:01:37] both going to confess our eyes back to
[1:01:39] perfect health your body will obey your
[1:01:42] confession sure will amen Revelation 21
[1:01:46] and we'll catch 9
[1:01:49] to1 and there came unto me one of the
[1:01:52] Seven Angels which had the seven vials
[1:01:56] full of the seven last plagues and
[1:01:59] talked with me saying come hither I will
[1:02:03] show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife so
[1:02:06] this is the exact same angel that you
[1:02:09] read of in Revelation 10:7 this is the
[1:02:12] exact same tour guide that John was
[1:02:15] given in Revelation chapter 1 all right
[1:02:18] this is the signifying Angel verse 10
[1:02:21] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[1:02:24] a great and high mountain now bear in
[1:02:26] mind he's going to show him the bride
[1:02:29] the Lamb's wife and he carried me away
[1:02:32] in the spirit to a great high mountain
[1:02:35] and he showed me that great
[1:02:39] City think about that he's going to take
[1:02:41] him to see the bride the Lamb's wife and
[1:02:44] he takes him to a high mountain and
[1:02:46] shows him the great City the holy
[1:02:49] Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from
[1:02:52] God so you can see the correlation
[1:02:54] between the bride and the city she's
[1:02:56] going to live in verse 11 having the
[1:02:58] glory of God and her light was like unto
[1:03:02] a stone most precious even like a jasper
[1:03:06] stone love this clear as Crystal amen
[1:03:11] let's pray father we commit ourselves
[1:03:14] into your hands for service now Lord and
[1:03:17] I pray that you will give us uh hearing
[1:03:19] Hearts today open our understanding of
[1:03:21] your word and Lord I I ask ask you to be
[1:03:24] with me in body and help me to be
[1:03:26] circumspect and use wisdom Lord for the
[1:03:29] spirit of the Prophet is subject to the
[1:03:31] prophet so I'm going to exercise some of
[1:03:33] that today Lord with your permission I
[1:03:36] commit it to you in Jesus name amen God
[1:03:39] bless you friends you can be
[1:03:53] seated
[1:04:05] praise the
[1:04:10] Lord we'll get as far as we
[1:04:15] need so I want
[1:04:17] to look at this 11th verse again having
[1:04:23] the glory of God you can go ahead
[1:04:25] brother Mark and put my PowerPoint up
[1:04:28] though I won't need the verse put up
[1:04:30] again and uh perfect we'll start right
[1:04:36] there turn it back on so I have a fresh
[1:04:40] cycling so he
[1:04:43] has taken J taken John to see the bride
[1:04:50] the Lamb's wife and he shows her he
[1:04:53] shows him a
[1:04:56] city and there's not a contradiction in
[1:04:59] the scripture what you're reading is
[1:05:01] actually a
[1:05:03] testimony it's a testimony concerning
[1:05:06] the bride amen because you're going to
[1:05:08] find out that these
[1:05:10] characteristics that describe the city
[1:05:14] also describe the bride because her
[1:05:17] record is now clear as Crystal she is
[1:05:21] even like a jasper stone that original
[1:05:23] Stone
[1:05:24] see and so we find that this is this is
[1:05:28] actually a perfect correlation of the
[1:05:31] city and the bride that's going to live
[1:05:33] there now so I'm going to say it like
[1:05:35] this the the inhabitants match the city
[1:05:40] the city matches the inhabitants
[1:05:43] Hallelujah and this is exactly why that
[1:05:47] the Bible says there will not be
[1:05:50] anything in that City and just
[1:05:53] paraphrasing the scripture that is
[1:05:55] contrary to the word no hor mongers no
[1:05:58] murderers no thieves there will be
[1:06:01] nothing in that City but Holiness and
[1:06:04] righteousness amen now if that's the
[1:06:06] case and the city is clear as Crystal
[1:06:10] then I'm here to tell you something
[1:06:12] friends your future is quite
[1:06:15] good because you're going to inhabit
[1:06:18] you're going to habitate in that City
[1:06:20] and your future is clear your
[1:06:24] testimony is clear and in fact the very
[1:06:29] word that we have here uh having the
[1:06:33] glory of God this actually this word in
[1:06:38] the in the Greek that they're using the
[1:06:40] glory of
[1:06:41] God is from we we read it most ministers
[1:06:45] know this it is the Greek word doca if
[1:06:49] I'm pronouncing that correctly and it
[1:06:52] has several derivatives and root words
[1:06:54] and meanings and doxes and Deo and but
[1:06:57] but what it means
[1:06:59] basically that having the glory of God
[1:07:02] having the doca of God this
[1:07:06] bride this city that bears the doca the
[1:07:11] glory of God is a root word that
[1:07:15] basically means to think or
[1:07:19] suppose and in in you know in in
[1:07:22] atmology when if you ever in Bible
[1:07:25] school atmology is the study of Words
[1:07:29] Their origin and their development over
[1:07:31] history amen is that easy going keep
[1:07:34] this real simple so so in atomology so
[1:07:38] so the the lexical says here etom
[1:07:43] atomically the word primarily means
[1:07:46] thought or opinion all right so it's an
[1:07:51] opinion uh as especially ially favorable
[1:07:55] human opinion and thus in a secondary
[1:07:59] sense
[1:08:01] reputation or or praise or honor that is
[1:08:06] bestowed upon you somebody holds you in
[1:08:10] high reputation amen they have a
[1:08:13] favorable opinion of you they are
[1:08:17] acknowledging
[1:08:18] Glory see it's not a presumptuous
[1:08:22] prideful thing the bride is there
[1:08:25] because she her reputation is glorious
[1:08:29] amen her the assessment of the Bride
[1:08:33] that inhabits that city is she was a
[1:08:37] Believer she reached Perfection she's
[1:08:40] Crystal Clear there's nothing against
[1:08:42] her she's in the image of Christ and the
[1:08:45] image of the bride and the image of
[1:08:47] Christ and the image of the city are all
[1:08:49] the same amen see so it means pray
[1:08:53] praise it means honor it means Splendor
[1:08:57] means light Perfection and now so thus
[1:09:00] doca of man now here's the problem you
[1:09:04] have the doca of man which is a human
[1:09:08] opinion of you but the problem with
[1:09:11] human opinion is that it's shifting amen
[1:09:15] yeah it could be up today down tomorrow
[1:09:18] amen that's that's how shallow the world
[1:09:21] is it doesn't matter how heroic you will
[1:09:25] be in the news tomorrow make a mistake
[1:09:29] or say the politically incorrect thing
[1:09:31] and watch cancel
[1:09:33] culture you know he say but but but I
[1:09:36] was a hero I did this and the answer
[1:09:38] that comes back from society is well
[1:09:41] what have you done for me lately yeah
[1:09:43] amen and that is a spirit on the age
[1:09:46] it's shallow it's
[1:09:48] ungrateful it it it don't that's why I
[1:09:51] say friends don't check face fortune and
[1:09:54] Glory of this world it's worthless amen
[1:09:59] amen it's so worthless that Jesus would
[1:10:03] not even accept it amen and they they
[1:10:08] come asking him you know who tell us you
[1:10:11] know they'd ask him one time by what
[1:10:13] Authority do you do this and then that
[1:10:15] became a discussion where they wouldn't
[1:10:17] answer his question he wouldn't answer
[1:10:18] theirs and then they're coming back you
[1:10:20] know and they're they're saying your
[1:10:21] witness is not true you're supposed to
[1:10:23] have a witness tell us who your
[1:10:25] Witnesses are that you're the Son of God
[1:10:27] and Jesus just looked him right in the
[1:10:29] eye and he said I don't accept the
[1:10:30] testimony of men first of all I don't
[1:10:33] accept it my father is my witness and
[1:10:35] that's it and you'll either believe his
[1:10:38] witness or you you'll you won't and he
[1:10:40] said and you won't see and you're going
[1:10:42] to die in your sins because you won't
[1:10:43] believe me you won't hear my words see
[1:10:46] and so so we find then Paul picks that
[1:10:50] up in the Book of Romans and he shows
[1:10:52] and I think I've
[1:10:54] was showing you this very recently that
[1:10:56] Paul says not only does a real servant
[1:10:59] of God not depend on the plotts of men
[1:11:05] he doesn't depend on acceptance of
[1:11:08] society not only does he not accept it
[1:11:12] he doesn't Chase it amen he doesn't try
[1:11:16] to get it he doesn't think about it the
[1:11:19] real servant of God cares nothing when
[1:11:21] brother brandham gave the analogy when
[1:11:24] that violinist was playing and he
[1:11:27] finished his piece the audience erupted
[1:11:30] in Applause and threw roses on the stage
[1:11:35] and they reporters noticed that he was
[1:11:37] ignoring the audience and he was looking
[1:11:40] up at the bo at the at the Box because
[1:11:44] there was Maestro there was his teacher
[1:11:46] and he only cared what his teacher
[1:11:49] thought Hallelujah it it what this is
[1:11:51] fine they're applauding they're clapping
[1:11:53] they're throwing roses but he was that
[1:11:55] meant nothing to him he wanted to know
[1:11:58] would his teacher rise and applaud and
[1:12:01] when he did then the man received see
[1:12:04] and so the we the beauty of this word is
[1:12:09] that that it is it is not the glory of
[1:12:15] people it's the glory of God Amen in
[1:12:20] other words it's not the world's opinion
[1:12:22] of you
[1:12:24] amen and I'm going to I'm going to go
[1:12:26] further it's not based on your opinion
[1:12:29] of you because sometimes I wonder whose
[1:12:32] opinion about me is worse the world or
[1:12:34] my own that's right when I look in the
[1:12:36] mirror and say you ungodly man how in
[1:12:39] the world you need to go to repent right
[1:12:40] now and and how come on is that right
[1:12:44] but I'm here to tell you that God is Not
[1:12:47] basing this on what you think of you
[1:12:49] he's not basing it on what others think
[1:12:51] of you it's his own opinion the glory of
[1:12:56] God was seen in her you say oh yeah it
[1:13:00] means God's glory no it means God's
[1:13:02] opinion of his
[1:13:04] bride it's God's opinion of you and me
[1:13:09] because we have believed the
[1:13:12] word after all it's God's opinion that
[1:13:15] marks the true value of things you see
[1:13:18] because that they're
[1:13:20] coming there's a reason for that why is
[1:13:25] it that you should
[1:13:27] just rest in the fact that it only
[1:13:31] matters what God
[1:13:34] thinks and the reason you should do that
[1:13:37] is because his you say but I I I've made
[1:13:41] so many mistakes and I'll probably make
[1:13:43] some more tomorrow but the beauty of it
[1:13:46] is no kidding his mind is eternal he
[1:13:50] already knows every mistake you all have
[1:13:53] made
[1:13:53] he already knows what you are now and he
[1:13:55] already knows every mistake you will
[1:13:57] make and he still says the glory of God
[1:14:01] is seen in
[1:14:03] her amen see so this is this becomes the
[1:14:08] beauty of the whole
[1:14:10] thing so brother brandham I'm going to
[1:14:13] give you a series of quotes here from
[1:14:15] brother brandham and well I must not
[1:14:18] have made that in WID screen apologize
[1:14:20] that's so narrow normally I I make that
[1:14:23] in in widecreen I apparently didn't do
[1:14:25] it but I think you'll be able to make it
[1:14:26] out so we're preaching today we're
[1:14:29] taking this logos becoming Rema it's
[1:14:32] part four in my
[1:14:34] series logos becoming Rema and here's
[1:14:37] what you should clearly understand by
[1:14:40] now the word becoming flesh amen I'm
[1:14:44] saying the same thing the top and the
[1:14:46] bottom are saying the same thing the
[1:14:48] word becoming flesh is the logos is this
[1:14:51] established word becoming this this
[1:14:55] moving and living through this that is
[1:14:58] the logos becoming Rema amen all right
[1:15:02] it starts out as an inspiration it comes
[1:15:04] as an anointing the the Lord brings
[1:15:08] forth a word that's sealed up completely
[1:15:11] and it's been sitting there for 20
[1:15:13] centuries but then there comes a time
[1:15:16] when a prophet is on the earth and Time
[1:15:19] meets prophecy and God unseals it and
[1:15:22] Believers now read it with understanding
[1:15:24] and when they read it and they hear the
[1:15:26] interpretation they something within
[1:15:28] them says
[1:15:30] amen and you know that it's
[1:15:33] supernatural because it doesn't stop at
[1:15:36] mental agreement it literally begins
[1:15:39] reshaping your life remolding your
[1:15:43] character
[1:15:44] Hallelujah and so the word literally
[1:15:47] becomes flesh because when the books are
[1:15:50] closed for the last time Prophet said
[1:15:52] the word will be flesh yeah amen as I've
[1:15:55] said to you before that God never
[1:15:58] intended for his word to stay bottled up
[1:16:01] here this is the third
[1:16:03] iteration this is the third iteration
[1:16:06] the first iteration was in the stars the
[1:16:09] second one was in Enoch's pyramid the
[1:16:11] third one is in a written book that's
[1:16:12] been preserved by God for 2,000 years
[1:16:16] but I'm going to tell you something
[1:16:17] Jesus never had to carry this amen Jesus
[1:16:21] was this amen that's why he astonished
[1:16:24] the doctors said he's only 12 what
[1:16:26] school did he go to he hadn't been to
[1:16:27] any school he came from God he was God
[1:16:32] he was the word see but you there your
[1:16:36] your life operates under the Holy Ghost
[1:16:41] I'm going to prove it to you your life
[1:16:44] operates under the leadership of the
[1:16:45] Holy Ghost in ways that even you can't
[1:16:48] explain to someone from this book that's
[1:16:51] right amen and people say you know why
[1:16:53] are you this and why are you that and
[1:16:55] sometimes you can have a well because
[1:16:57] the Bible says this the Bible says that
[1:16:59] but there's so much about our life that
[1:17:02] can't be brought down to black and white
[1:17:04] text but you know like job I know whom I
[1:17:07] have believed I know my redeemer live it
[1:17:09] and and there's something driving my
[1:17:12] life in this
[1:17:13] direction and and I can try to explain
[1:17:16] it to you you may not even agree with it
[1:17:17] but I can't go back that's right amen
[1:17:21] hallelujah see amen now there's a reason
[1:17:25] that it happens like that and it's not
[1:17:27] because you became convinced mentally
[1:17:32] right the false church that the Bible
[1:17:36] speaks of has a form of godliness amen
[1:17:41] they as brother brandham said they
[1:17:42] actually admire the fine qualities of
[1:17:46] Jesus and so they they it creates a form
[1:17:49] of godliness in them but but to have the
[1:17:53] the real power take over their lives and
[1:17:56] start transforming them into the into
[1:18:00] this in flesh form they're not for that
[1:18:03] they have a form of godliness but they
[1:18:05] deny the power in other words I just
[1:18:08] believe it mentally I'm not going to
[1:18:10] alter anything I just agree with it and
[1:18:14] those are the ones that Jesus will say
[1:18:17] the king will say depart from me you
[1:18:20] workers of iniquity I never knew you
[1:18:23] and their testimony will be goodness we
[1:18:25] preached in your name and we did all
[1:18:27] these things in your name how have you
[1:18:29] not known us because they they they they
[1:18:33] they failed to accept the warning of the
[1:18:35] Holy Spirit they failed to accept the
[1:18:39] the the plan of God's provided way amen
[1:18:44] God has a prophet said one provided way
[1:18:47] of escape and that is to receive all of
[1:18:50] his
[1:18:51] word see say well I just I just you know
[1:18:56] I just believe Jesus wonderful so do I
[1:19:00] but do oh you know I I asked one
[1:19:03] determined unbeliever one time he said
[1:19:05] you know all I need all I need is Jesus
[1:19:07] at Calvary Calvary plus nothing and I
[1:19:11] said sure I agree with that to a certain
[1:19:13] point meaning that there's nothing I can
[1:19:15] do it's Calvary completely I had no way
[1:19:18] to save myself but that's not the whole
[1:19:20] program of God that's not all of
[1:19:22] redemption
[1:19:23] he said well how do you figure that
[1:19:25] Jesus said it's finished yeah Jesus said
[1:19:28] it's finished meaning that the purchase
[1:19:29] price had been paid but the claiming
[1:19:31] work still isn't done John was crying in
[1:19:34] the Book of Revelation because no one
[1:19:36] had claimed the book amen and John was
[1:19:40] standing on
[1:19:42] Calvary so close that he had a
[1:19:44] conversation with Christ you're not
[1:19:46] going to get more of a front row seat
[1:19:48] than
[1:19:49] John and even Jesus spoke to him son beh
[1:19:52] Behold thy mother speaking of Mary woman
[1:19:55] Behold thy son you couldn't get more of
[1:19:58] a front row seat than John and John
[1:20:02] watched him die and John met him again
[1:20:05] after he was born after he raised from
[1:20:07] the dead and John was on the hill when
[1:20:09] he ascended and John was in the upper
[1:20:11] room when his life came back you
[1:20:14] understand but yet John is only the
[1:20:17] island weeping because he knows that
[1:20:19] although the purchase work is completed
[1:20:21] if no one claims
[1:20:23] me I I my name's in that book but I
[1:20:27] can't don't do me any good it's sealed
[1:20:29] up I got to have somebody with authority
[1:20:32] who can step forward and say that's my
[1:20:34] book and open it and reveal and now John
[1:20:38] said Oh Heaven heard me shouting and
[1:20:41] praising
[1:20:45] God so you know I I I said to this young
[1:20:49] man I said imagine if you were standing
[1:20:52] there with John on okay you see yourself
[1:20:55] yeah you see Jesus dying yeah you
[1:20:57] believe in him yeah what's your
[1:20:59] testimony if you could speak to him what
[1:21:01] would it be Lord I believe you and trust
[1:21:03] you you know even even the thief said
[1:21:05] Lord remember me when you come in your
[1:21:07] kingdom right and I said now that's
[1:21:10] wonderful he said right so I'm finished
[1:21:13] I said okay wait I got another
[1:21:14] question after you left
[1:21:17] Calvary and after the day of Pentecost
[1:21:21] which is in the Bible and then the
[1:21:24] disciples his Apostles start writing
[1:21:26] letters and Paul starts pinning The Book
[1:21:30] of Romans and then he starts pinning
[1:21:32] First Corinthians and second Corinthians
[1:21:35] he goes on down through the list and
[1:21:37] starts pinning to Ephesians and
[1:21:38] Philippians and Colossians and goes on
[1:21:40] down and then Peter starts writing
[1:21:42] letters and first Peter and second Peter
[1:21:44] and first John and second John and third
[1:21:45] John and Jude wres and and I said do you
[1:21:49] think that you could find right standing
[1:21:52] in the presence of God by saying on the
[1:21:55] day of judgment well Lord I just
[1:21:57] believed you at Calvary but as far as
[1:21:59] Paul and Peter and John all those guys I
[1:22:01] didn't need them I didn't need all those
[1:22:03] letters Lord I believe you I didn't need
[1:22:06] their teachings I didn't need their
[1:22:08] doctrines you think that's going to pass
[1:22:10] the mustard no no sir I'm telling you
[1:22:13] what you're going to go to straight to
[1:22:14] hell because you have to take all the
[1:22:17] word of God you see friends that's why
[1:22:21] that's exactly why on the day of J
[1:22:23] listen brother brandham talks about that
[1:22:25] this bride at the end time will write
[1:22:27] another book of Acts you know when we
[1:22:30] write the last chapter we're writing it
[1:22:32] right now I'm about to prove it to you
[1:22:34] in the quotes you we're writing chapters
[1:22:37] uh
[1:22:38] continuation the book of Acts you got
[1:22:40] the book of Acts uh pre- Church ages and
[1:22:44] a book of a continuation of the book of
[1:22:46] Acts post Church ages amen and and this
[1:22:49] one is still being written yes amen and
[1:22:52] in fact is it when we it it's it's the
[1:22:55] record of Christ in Redemption so it'll
[1:22:58] that's why time continues on in the
[1:23:00] Millennium the account still continues
[1:23:02] on the Millennium we're still where the
[1:23:05] the the Heathen are raised up and
[1:23:06] civilization will carry right on but at
[1:23:09] the Judgment bar there's going to be one
[1:23:11] last chapter before Redemption is
[1:23:15] done and then the book of the last
[1:23:17] chapter of the of the book of Acts can
[1:23:19] be written and that will be on the day
[1:23:22] of judgment when
[1:23:25] your logos that became Rema and became
[1:23:30] flesh stands as a witness like Jesus
[1:23:34] said that on that day the queen of the
[1:23:36] South will rise in Judgment of this
[1:23:39] generation for she traveled at Peril of
[1:23:42] her life on that day the the people of
[1:23:45] Nineveh will arise and condemn this
[1:23:48] generation because they repented and
[1:23:50] that was just Nineveh and that was just
[1:23:52] that was just Jonah that was just a
[1:23:54] queen and and we talk about the days of
[1:23:57] Solomon he said but a greater than
[1:23:58] Jonah's here a greater than Solomon is
[1:24:01] here I'm here to tell you something
[1:24:02] friends on that last day the last
[1:24:05] chapter will be God will be just God
[1:24:09] will be righteous in that he will bring
[1:24:11] forth not his written word but his
[1:24:14] living
[1:24:15] bride and say My bride is proof that my
[1:24:19] word was
[1:24:20] true Hallelujah amen and it will be the
[1:24:24] testimony of Our Lives that the just
[1:24:27] judge can say you had the chance they
[1:24:30] lived right across from you they met
[1:24:32] twice a week you heard them on the
[1:24:34] Internet you saw their lives before you
[1:24:37] and you you only wanted the fine
[1:24:39] qualities of Jesus you had a form of
[1:24:41] godliness but you denied the power
[1:24:44] thereof depart from me you worker of
[1:24:48] iniquity sir because the word is being
[1:24:53] made flesh in you yes amen
[1:24:56] amen because of that that's good because
[1:25:00] they see your chased conversation
[1:25:04] amen not only your speech but your
[1:25:08] behavior they see your actions and
[1:25:11] reactions to the word of God saying Amen
[1:25:14] to the word is not just a verbal
[1:25:15] testimony it's a living experience on
[1:25:18] display that's what John saw he said
[1:25:21] come I'll show you the bride the Lamb's
[1:25:23] wife and he said he took me to a high
[1:25:24] mountain showed me that great City
[1:25:26] having the glory having the testimony of
[1:25:30] God saying this is my bride she matches
[1:25:34] my City My City matches me she matches
[1:25:37] me I match my word she is my word oh
[1:25:42] Hallelujah see amen so this is why it's
[1:25:45] so Paramount for us to always try to
[1:25:49] strive to be like Jesus and do always
[1:25:51] that which pleases the father Amen
[1:25:54] brother
[1:25:58] brandham says here an
[1:26:02] identification and I've got these these
[1:26:04] first ones in chronological order I'm
[1:26:06] going to drop back on the last ones but
[1:26:09] here it is and this is a prophetic
[1:26:10] challenge now this is the first of two
[1:26:13] that we're going to read about you ready
[1:26:15] for the first one amen
[1:26:19] 1963 I challenge you and the name of
[1:26:22] Jesus Christ to believe that this
[1:26:25] message of the holy spirit in this last
[1:26:27] days is the closing out of the world's
[1:26:30] history I challenge you to believe that
[1:26:33] I taught it to you tonight you believe
[1:26:35] that God sent me am amen amen so when it
[1:26:40] comes across like that there's really
[1:26:44] only one of two
[1:26:46] responses yes or
[1:26:48] noad I challenge you to believe
[1:26:53] that you believe that God sent me and
[1:26:56] this message that I'm bringing from the
[1:26:58] Holy Ghost is the message before the end
[1:27:01] of the world in the last days the
[1:27:03] closing out of the world's history
[1:27:07] amen you accept the
[1:27:12] challenge he comes th this was just
[1:27:15] prior to the seals he comes right after
[1:27:17] it now in this last day God has sent
[1:27:22] back the Holy
[1:27:25] Spirit which if Jesus Christ is the same
[1:27:29] yesterday day and forever then he is
[1:27:32] still the same Messiah and the and the
[1:27:35] life of Christ is in his church
[1:27:38] vindicating his word so now that that
[1:27:43] that
[1:27:45] invalidates any modernization yeah of
[1:27:49] the church amen any modernization
[1:27:53] because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:27:55] yesterday day and forever I remember
[1:27:58] when brother Ernie came out of he was
[1:28:00] first he was Church of Christ and then
[1:28:02] he I think was at UPC and at UPC was the
[1:28:06] the last one he moved before he moved
[1:28:08] into the ranks of the message and
[1:28:10] brother Ernie you know they they said to
[1:28:13] him oh brother Ernie you're going off in
[1:28:15] a cult you're you're going off the deep
[1:28:16] end you know we we have the revealed
[1:28:19] word of the hour and brother Ernie said
[1:28:22] okay well I got a question if somebody
[1:28:23] can just answer me this question please
[1:28:24] it'll help me maybe I maybe I'm making
[1:28:26] the wrong decision okay brother Ernie
[1:28:28] what's your question he said now we know
[1:28:30] historically and it's not hard because
[1:28:32] we only got started in the 19 in the
[1:28:35] 1900s we know and you don't have to look
[1:28:38] back very far that when the Pentecostal
[1:28:41] movement first began women didn't cut
[1:28:43] their
[1:28:45] hair and we know that women didn't wear
[1:28:49] garments that pertained to a man they
[1:28:51] didn't do that they observed the
[1:28:52] 2,000-year old custom of the church that
[1:28:55] women wore dresses they didn't wear
[1:28:58] pants they didn't cut their hair our
[1:29:01] Godly sisters in the original didn't
[1:29:03] paint their face up with war paint like
[1:29:05] Jezebel and hang all kinds of earrings
[1:29:07] and and and and look like brother M said
[1:29:10] look like you went through a five and
[1:29:11] dime with a magnet
[1:29:12] on
[1:29:14] Amen and he said our men didn't use to
[1:29:17] smoke and drink and and drink socially
[1:29:19] and curse when they get mad they didn't
[1:29:21] use to run gambling joints and casinos
[1:29:23] we didn't used to do those things in
[1:29:26] Pentecost now historically they couldn't
[1:29:28] deny that so brother but that wasn't
[1:29:31] brother Ernie's question that was just
[1:29:32] he was building his foundation to ask
[1:29:34] his question he says so here's my
[1:29:36] question did we start wrong or are we
[1:29:40] finishing wrong that's
[1:29:42] right my amen do not pass go do not
[1:29:47] collect $200 go directly to jail answer
[1:29:51] the question question right don't beat
[1:29:53] around the bush answer the question did
[1:29:56] we start wrong or are we finishing
[1:29:59] wrong I happen to believe they're
[1:30:01] finishing wrong because Jesus Christ is
[1:30:05] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:30:09] when the world sees you Godly sisters
[1:30:12] living like sisters always did And when
[1:30:14] they see you Godly Brothers Living Like
[1:30:17] Brothers always did then they won't have
[1:30:19] an excuse on the day of judgment because
[1:30:21] the word became
[1:30:26] flesh so and the life of
[1:30:29] Christ So Yesterday day and forever then
[1:30:32] he is still the same Messiah try to deny
[1:30:36] that and the life of Christ is in his
[1:30:38] church vindicating his word that's how
[1:30:41] God was in the earth in the form of
[1:30:43] Jesus Christ being the word to make the
[1:30:46] word live you catch that that's how he
[1:30:48] was the word because he made the word
[1:30:50] live he was a man man but he made the
[1:30:52] word live perfectly no one had ever been
[1:30:55] able to do that see and the holy now
[1:30:58] watch say oh yeah how great Jesus that
[1:31:00] was but watch and the Holy Spirit is
[1:31:04] today in flesh making the word of God
[1:31:09] live to every promise and every wonder
[1:31:13] and everything that he promised it's
[1:31:16] there now he promised more than Malachi
[1:31:20] 4 amen he promised more than Revelation
[1:31:25] 107 he also promised that in verses 8-
[1:31:29] 11 a bride John representing would call
[1:31:33] and take the book and eat the book and
[1:31:35] become the book so a prophet went home
[1:31:38] doesn't matter it doesn't stop Jesus
[1:31:40] Christ being the same yesterday today
[1:31:43] and
[1:31:43] [Music]
[1:31:45] forever
[1:31:48] see he goes
[1:31:50] on uh um week
[1:31:53] later the world is again falling
[1:31:57] apart he told Abraham now I'm just I'm
[1:32:00] giving you quotes that are all saying
[1:32:01] the same
[1:32:03] thing he told Abraham that's exactly
[1:32:05] what he would do and there watch this
[1:32:09] and there had to be
[1:32:12] someone come on the scene at that time
[1:32:17] to make the word just making sure I'm
[1:32:19] staying with myself here if I'm off
[1:32:21] course I shouldn't be but somebody get
[1:32:23] my attention so he
[1:32:25] says he told Abraham that's exactly what
[1:32:28] he would do and there had to be someone
[1:32:31] come on the scene at that time to do
[1:32:33] what to make the word live right before
[1:32:35] them so God gave the promise to Abraham
[1:32:38] so Abraham had to fulfill it brother
[1:32:42] brother said God would have never gave
[1:32:43] Abraham an unconditional Covenant like
[1:32:45] that do you realize what exposure God
[1:32:47] would have I mean that's that's business
[1:32:50] suicide you're talking about exposure of
[1:32:53] your company to to liability you know
[1:32:56] you know you got to have rules and
[1:32:58] regulations and you got to be able to
[1:33:00] hire and fire if somebody breaks uh goes
[1:33:02] outside the lines God came down to
[1:33:04] Abraham and said Abraham I'm going to
[1:33:06] sink my whole Kingdom on you and it has
[1:33:10] it's not going to it's and to make it
[1:33:12] sure he said it's not about what you've
[1:33:14] done or even what you will do I'm just
[1:33:17] here to tell you what I've already done
[1:33:21] I chose you that's it you're going to be
[1:33:23] my man and Abraham was and even Abraham
[1:33:27] himself backslid and went down to Egypt
[1:33:29] picks up Hagar brother Brandon talks
[1:33:31] about that and see does not air with a
[1:33:33] shook picked up that egyp Egyptian maid
[1:33:35] Israel is still to this day paying for
[1:33:37] that sin see CU through Hagar came
[1:33:41] Ishmael and so and that was a wild man
[1:33:43] but but we find that that didn't stop
[1:33:45] Abraham he got caught lying and cheating
[1:33:48] that didn't stop the promise he goes
[1:33:50] back and finds the king of the
[1:33:51] Philistines and starts doing the same
[1:33:53] thing starts lying and cheating trying
[1:33:55] to save his own hide that didn't stop it
[1:33:58] either that God plagued that King for
[1:34:01] getting lied
[1:34:03] to and God told that king that's his
[1:34:06] wife but Lord I'm an honest man the
[1:34:08] Integrity of my heart you know he told
[1:34:10] me it was his sister and the Lord said
[1:34:12] you're right I do I know you're a
[1:34:13] righteous King therefore I'm I'm trying
[1:34:16] to save your life restore his wife and
[1:34:18] ask him to pray for you and I'll forgive
[1:34:20] you so I got to wait a minut let me get
[1:34:22] this straight man lies to me comes into
[1:34:25] my territory lies to me and then now my
[1:34:29] my kingdom is plagued and I got to go to
[1:34:32] this liar this coward who was about to
[1:34:34] let me take his own wife and he's got to
[1:34:37] pray for me are you are you're going to

[1:35:11] um so there had to
[1:35:14] come on the scene at that time to make
[1:35:17] the word live right before them that's
[1:35:19] why you're here God had sent his Moses

[1:40:25] let it let the word dwell in you richly
[1:40:30] he comes a little later now we're in
[1:40:31] 1964 he's in the
[1:40:34] token the new token is the new life that
[1:40:37] comes through Jesus Christ when his
[1:40:40] blood was shed to sanctify a church fill
[1:40:43] it with his
[1:40:44] presence that why that why why we got
[1:40:47] token that he might manifest his word
[1:40:50] and his promise to the people say why do
[1:40:53] we have a token to give me overcoming
[1:40:54] power sure why do we have a token so I
[1:40:56] can go in the Rapture yeah why do we
[1:40:58] have a token so that I can have strength
[1:41:00] and be a believer yeah but why else do
[1:41:02] we have the token why are you here why
[1:41:06] did he give you his life so that you can
[1:41:10] so that he might manifest his word are
[1:41:13] you letting him token people token
[1:41:17] people how many got a
[1:41:19] token are you letting
[1:41:22] him it's up to you he won't take your
[1:41:26] token away but he's asking you a
[1:41:28] question will you let it see amen will
[1:41:33] you let that word be
[1:41:36] anointed or will you give your life over
[1:41:40] to Fortune and Glory come on is the is
[1:41:44] the primary purpose of your life higher
[1:41:46] education more money and social
[1:41:49] station
[1:41:52] you might be a token person but you're
[1:41:53] not doing
[1:41:56] that because you've got the wrong
[1:41:59] priorities in your life is the is this
[1:42:02] the house of correction does correction
[1:42:04] start at the house of the Lord is that
[1:42:06] where judgment starts so you're not mad
[1:42:08] at me are
[1:42:09] you I had to endure this studying it
[1:42:13] see so that's what the new the the the
[1:42:16] new token is for that he might manifest
[1:42:20] his his promises to the people now watch
[1:42:24] him go back into Hebrews God in sunry
[1:42:28] times and divers manners Hebrews 1 said
[1:42:31] he spoke to the fathers through the
[1:42:33] prophets now hold
[1:42:36] on how did he speak to them through
[1:42:40] flesh he anointed men this was prior to
[1:42:44] the sacrifice of the Lamb prior to the
[1:42:46] holy ghost coming upon God's family in
[1:42:48] fact is it's it's so prior that that the
[1:42:51] anointing couldn't even stay on the
[1:42:52] prophets amen that's why John was told
[1:42:55] upon whom you see the the spirit of God
[1:42:58] descend and remain that's a prototype
[1:43:00] that's a new kind of person you ain't
[1:43:02] seen that one see there was a time when
[1:43:05] that Pillar of Fire could could be with
[1:43:08] Adam and it it it could be there
[1:43:09] continually but now but now for 4,000
[1:43:12] years that's been lost but there's
[1:43:14] coming a just one and when he comes and
[1:43:16] gives his life and ascends to the father
[1:43:18] to lay that body on the sacrifice the
[1:43:21] the altar of Mercy then he can send that
[1:43:24] life back in and now he can have a whole
[1:43:26] body around the world who are
[1:43:29] manifesting his word just like he did
[1:43:31] when he was in the earth oh my how could
[1:43:35] people not want that kind of a
[1:43:39] truth
[1:43:41] amen so he so how did he do it he spoke
[1:43:44] through prophets see but in the last
[1:43:47] days through his son now brother
[1:43:49] brandham is going Old Testament he's in
[1:43:52] the Keystone of the gospels where Jesus
[1:43:55] fulfilled that Paul's talking about
[1:43:57] Jesus Christ what now what what is his
[1:44:00] son the
[1:44:02] word
[1:44:04] amen the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:44:08] among us this is why you are a son of
[1:44:13] God Amen you say I'm a Son of God
[1:44:15] because I've been born again how'd you
[1:44:16] get born
[1:44:18] again well because because I chose no no
[1:44:21] wait Jesus looked right at his disciples
[1:44:23] said you did not choose me I chose you
[1:44:26] amen you understand that you as I've
[1:44:29] said to you before the Book of Life
[1:44:31] brother brandham shows it's in two
[1:44:33] sections it looks like when you read it
[1:44:34] from the scripture sometimes looks like
[1:44:36] two different books brother brand said
[1:44:37] no it's not the same book but it's got a
[1:44:39] special section it's got an the Lamb's
[1:44:42] Book of Life has a section of
[1:44:46] election that that's his or origin
[1:44:49] that's his tribe that's his kin that's
[1:44:52] his family they come from him they were
[1:44:55] when when the pillar of fire was with
[1:44:58] God and was God you were the same was in
[1:45:02] the beginning with God why is he
[1:45:05] repeating himself cuz it's the whole
[1:45:08] family I was in Christ when that Pillar
[1:45:10] of Fire before the heavens and earth
[1:45:12] were even formed brother Brenham says
[1:45:15] before there was
[1:45:17] Stardust you existed
[1:45:21] de Hallelujah when he was with God and
[1:45:25] he was God and the same was in the
[1:45:28] beginning with
[1:45:29] God I came from God I go back to God why
[1:45:33] am I a Believer why do I have a token
[1:45:35] because I'm elected how am I elected
[1:45:37] because of the origin I came from
[1:45:40] him and and that's why only the
[1:45:43] predestinated are considered in
[1:45:44] Redemption we're not talking about basic
[1:45:47] salvation from destruction the foolish
[1:45:49] virgin or save from destruction heathens
[1:45:52] are raised up in the Millennium save
[1:45:54] from destruction to hear the gospel but
[1:45:56] I'm not saved just merely saved I'm
[1:46:01] redeemed so why am
[1:46:03] I so that once again the word can be
[1:46:07] flesh and
[1:46:09] dwell in Among
[1:46:12] Us I mean this is this is this is what
[1:46:17] is
[1:46:18] seen when the firstborn son son was
[1:46:21] expressed when he said let us make man
[1:46:24] he made brother said he made his whole
[1:46:25] family made all man his whole kingdom
[1:46:28] was in his mind all of his future sons
[1:46:31] and daughters down down to the all the
[1:46:34] way down to the consummation of
[1:46:37] everything he's not going to lose one
[1:46:40] amen see so I mean little wonder you
[1:46:44] know that I was seen in Christ before
[1:46:46] the formation of the heavens and the
[1:46:48] Earth and and I mean the that that's a
[1:46:51] real conundrum for Baptist
[1:46:54] Theology and because that's why they
[1:46:56] hate the word predestination yeah see
[1:47:00] because to
[1:47:02] them logically you understand
[1:47:07] logically to them well wait a
[1:47:10] minute if Christian if Christian if
[1:47:13] Christianity is believes in
[1:47:16] predestination then everything's already
[1:47:18] fixed and nobody really has free choice
[1:47:22] and that's why they have a problem with
[1:47:23] it yeah that's that's why they they
[1:47:26] can't get past that because because they
[1:47:28] they could say if everything is already
[1:47:32] fixed then what then what's the point of
[1:47:35] Acts two when they said to Peter what
[1:47:38] must we do and the implication was to be
[1:47:41] saved what we've killed the Messiah you
[1:47:42] told us there's still a chance it wasn't
[1:47:44] possible the grave could hold him God
[1:47:46] made him both Lord and Christ so what do
[1:47:47] we do now and Peter said repent
[1:47:50] why if I'm predestinated what's the
[1:47:53] point be baptized why and that's the
[1:47:56] Baptist argument it invalidates
[1:47:59] everything we're told in the Bible if
[1:48:00] predestination is true then it's all
[1:48:03] fixed and there's really no human Choice
[1:48:05] ultimately then why repent why do
[1:48:08] anything Paul picks up that exact human
[1:48:10] argument they they Paul Paul said you
[1:48:13] know you're going to argue you silly nut
[1:48:16] you're gonna argue that why don't I just
[1:48:19] go if if my evil and then God can save
[1:48:23] me makes God glorified then I should go
[1:48:25] commit some more evil and Paul said
[1:48:27] you're a fool to talk like that you know
[1:48:31] and then and they said well Paul if it's
[1:48:32] predestination then who hath resisted
[1:48:34] his will I'm only being why does he find
[1:48:37] fault with me if I was supposed to be a
[1:48:39] sinner and I am then he should be
[1:48:41] happy make sense humanly and Paul said
[1:48:46] you're an
[1:48:48] idiot he said you're C crazy to think
[1:48:51] like that amen you see the element that
[1:48:54] they're missing the reason it's such a
[1:48:57] jam in their mind is because they don't
[1:49:00] understand election amen that God
[1:49:03] provides a legitimate opportunity for
[1:49:05] all men who are in the Book of Life all
[1:49:09] Humanity everybody gets a legitimate
[1:49:11] chance to save themselves from
[1:49:14] destruction and God will grant them
[1:49:16] eternal life at the Judgment they've got
[1:49:18] a they can do that they
[1:49:20] and and it's even almost some very
[1:49:22] minimal
[1:49:23] requirements but but that's just
[1:49:24] salvation Redemption means he already
[1:49:27] owned you lost you then he brought you
[1:49:28] back that's why only the predestinated
[1:49:31] are considered in Redemption because the
[1:49:34] section of the Lamb's Book of Life has
[1:49:36] nothing to do with a choice I made or
[1:49:39] choice you made or I was a goody two
[1:49:41] shoes or I was evil had nothing to do
[1:49:43] with it I started in God I believe God
[1:49:47] I'm going back to God it is a it is the
[1:49:50] master of my life is his
[1:49:53] word
[1:49:55] amen and that's they don't understand
[1:49:58] that that that true election is fixed in
[1:50:02] origin
[1:50:04] see so so so for his family they they
[1:50:08] didn't choose to be his children they
[1:50:11] were always his children see all right I
[1:50:16] I got to stop in five minutes going to
[1:50:18] do it this time
[1:50:21] and this
[1:50:23] Revelation the completeness of Christ am
[1:50:27] whoever will add one word to it or take
[1:50:30] one word from it the same will be taken
[1:50:33] his part out of the book of life now he
[1:50:38] obviously says that because people do it
[1:50:40] yeah amen it's if people do it then it
[1:50:44] becomes apparent that there will be
[1:50:46] people who don't do it amen and it's not
[1:50:49] about
[1:50:50] Doctrine right it's about you being the
[1:50:53] word so that's why message light can't
[1:50:57] work amen that's why a watered down
[1:51:00] message that that seeks to to be mingled
[1:51:03] with M we need to update our thinking
[1:51:06] you know this was back in the 60s well
[1:51:09] that's nothing that's just young this
[1:51:11] thing goes all the way back 2,000 years
[1:51:13] ago I'm still believing 2,000 years ago
[1:51:16] why would I not believe from the 60s you
[1:51:18] got to be kidding how dumb is that it's
[1:51:21] even it's even closer to me I'm here to
[1:51:23] tell you you can't change you don't move
[1:51:25] the ancient landmarks the same yesterday
[1:51:28] day and forever you can't change
[1:51:30] yourself into something halfway between
[1:51:32] the word and halfway between the world
[1:51:34] you're not even in the economy of God if
[1:51:37] you do that you need the Holy Ghost you
[1:51:40] need to get to an
[1:51:42] [Applause]
[1:51:45] altar there is a revelation we only need
[1:51:48] the token with us to make make that word
[1:51:50] live again that's what he
[1:51:52] sent the token for am it's give us the
[1:51:57] state gives us a statement that we know
[1:52:00] is the
[1:52:02] truth let me let me let me read that
[1:52:05] real
[1:52:09] quick find my place
[1:52:15] yeah all right so in Paradox he he moves
[1:52:18] on now what is
[1:52:22] it Christ coming to his
[1:52:26] body word Christ in the word we all know
[1:52:30] the anointing is Christ that one that
[1:52:33] comes on the word that makes the word
[1:52:35] live see so it's it's not uh not putting
[1:52:41] an anointed word in us all right this I
[1:52:44] I accidentally put that inside the quote
[1:52:47] that's actually my own note that part
[1:52:48] right there so so it's so brother bam
[1:52:50] says the anointing is Christ that comes
[1:52:52] on the word that makes the word live so
[1:52:54] it's not putting an anointing an
[1:52:56] anointed word in us but anointing a word
[1:53:00] seed already in us from birth
[1:53:05] see and so so so so that's that's what
[1:53:08] he's showing here is that right that is
[1:53:11] the
[1:53:13] anointing Christ is the anointing the
[1:53:15] spirit that comes upon the word that
[1:53:19] makes the word live okay I think I oh I
[1:53:22] see why I did that so Christ is the
[1:53:26] anointing you with me the spirit that
[1:53:29] comes upon the word that quickens the
[1:53:31] word to make to make it live now the
[1:53:33] word is in your heart and you believe in
[1:53:37] Divine Healing whatever more see and
[1:53:41] Christ the anointing coming to his body
[1:53:45] see the connection there you you find
[1:53:49] he's looking for you to see a connection
[1:53:51] like husband and wife to become one GL
[1:53:56] now the church has got to get to the
[1:54:00] ministry until the church and Christ
[1:54:03] become one he can anoint you for every
[1:54:06] blessing that's in the Bible all of it
[1:54:09] is yours everything is Promised at this
[1:54:12] age is yours when we leave anything out
[1:54:16] see then if anointing strikes that it
[1:54:20] will anoint it you with me you believe
[1:54:29] it now today I'm finishing
[1:54:32] up he is still alive he is still here he
[1:54:37] is proving himself by his word the word
[1:54:40] is God you believe it
[1:54:42] amen and then this word is allotted here
[1:54:45] for this day that's got to be somebody
[1:54:49] amen
[1:54:50] somebody it's not a Doctrine it's a body
[1:54:54] it's got to be somebody come by that
[1:54:58] that word can become quickened and make
[1:55:02] that word live amen
[1:55:07] amen now Challenge number two and we're

[2:00:32] astonishing
[2:00:34] things we've seen that your plan is to
[2:00:37] is to sum it all up at the end time by
[2:00:40] having a bride walking in the so much in
[2:00:42] the way of your word that a prophet said
[2:00:45] so much so that it'll bring the Dead for
[2:00:49] hundreds and hundreds of years it'll
[2:00:51] bring them right out of the grave and
[2:00:54] it'll change us in a moment in the
[2:00:56] twinkling of an i we'll go to meet the
[2:00:58] Lord in the air we're in the process of
[2:01:01] that right now Lord the world is burning
[2:01:02] down around us it is falling apart it is
[2:01:06] again falling apart it can't recover
[2:01:08] itself
[2:01:09] Lord prophecy set in motion and can't be

[2:01:20] will hear our voice can be
[2:01:24] saved as many as will believe on the
[2:01:26] Lord Jesus Christ can be
[2:01:30] saved but Lord we recognize today that
[2:01:33] there's a there's another section to
[2:01:35] that great book of
[2:01:37] life and it's a a a book lord that has
[2:01:41] the origin of your family it's Written
[2:01:44] in the Stars written in the pyramid it's
[2:01:46] written in the Bible it's all through it
[2:01:49] there's a great City coming Lord where a
[2:01:51] bride who mirrors that City will live
[2:01:55] there a city mirrored by a bride a bride
[2:01:58] mirroring the word the word mirroring
[2:02:01] you we find out Lord by Divine
[2:02:03] Revelation by a message of the hour that
[2:02:06] it's all the word it's all the word it's
[2:02:09] all the word in just different forms
[2:02:12] whether it was the one that was with God
[2:02:14] or was God or the same was in the
[2:02:16] beginning with God whether it's the
[2:02:19] logos in our Bibles the established word
[2:02:22] whether it's the Rema acting out through
[2:02:24] flesh as long as it's the word of God
[2:02:26] and the Holy Spirit moving according to
[2:02:28] the word then that is the word Made
[2:02:31] Alive made flesh amen it it chokes the
[2:02:34] world Lord they can't grasp that but we
[2:02:38] joyfully we joyfully say oh God let me
[2:02:40] be a part of that Lord I raise my hands
[2:02:43] today father if there's anyone in here
[2:02:46] today who knows that they need to they
[2:02:48] we need to assess Lord deep down and say
[2:02:51] am I letting am I letting the word dwell
[2:02:55] in me richly am I allowing the anointing
[2:02:59] of God to come upon me or is my
[2:03:02] Pursuit is my Pursuit the attached to
[2:03:06] the love of the world or the things of
[2:03:08] the world if it is Lord I pray you smash
[2:03:11] that take it out of our hearts give us a
[2:03:15] give us a reboot Lord let us let us have
[2:03:18] a r in of our mind oh God to not be Lord
[2:03:23] conformed to the world but to be
[2:03:26] transformed by the renewing of our
[2:03:29] mind I commit it to you today Lord I
[2:03:32] feel satisfied that I hit a spot where I
[2:03:35] could just hit a pause button I thank
[2:03:37] you enough's been said now you can deal
[2:03:39] with your children we commit this this
[2:03:42] word preached the word that will be
[2:03:44] preached if next week if there is a next
[2:03:47] week Lord I commit it to you all I
[2:03:51] commit all of it into your hands to
[2:03:52] bring it to pass I've declared your word
