========================================
e e [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] everyone let's stand and pray Heavenly Father we just come before you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we ask that your Holy Spirit would take control of every heart and every every thought Lord we want to bring every thought into captivity of The Obedience of Christ Lord guide and direct each one of us Lord fill us with the holy spirit and wisdom and understanding Lord that we would know the hour we're living in and and see that we're in the closing of time the end of the end Lord thank you thank you for this Revelation thank you for this understanding that you've given to us through a Vindicated Prophet we commit ourselves to you we ask in Jesus name amen all right part three continuing on about Israel God's time piece we'll read the scripture I mean the whole thing will be reading scripture so but we'll read a couple scriptures and then you can sit down Romans 10 veres 10 and 11 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith who whoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord overall is Rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so this is uh in context we started at the beginning of chapter n looking back through uh nine 10 and we're going to go through 11 Lord willing we'll finish this time but who knows um we're looking at Israel brother Bram says if you want to know what time it is on God's calendar look at Israel amen and so you know we go back through time through the last 60 70 years and you know each time we could overreact and say it's got to be now of course in uh I wasn't around then but in the 6068 and 73 and knowing what brother brandham said message Believers were like this this is it this is it and as I look at it I don't want to be the one to tell you this is not it because we're always to be anticipating but what I see is happening is things are being set in order for the tribulation period and we're not going to know the day or the hour that's right and so in principle we can't say oh it's going to be in the next 3 months 6 months this day this time um we know that it's soon which is a wonderful word soon it could mean anything but with that said is things are being set in order if we look in scripture we understand that behind the scenes the Roman Catholic Church is pulling strings through through different organizations whatever they might be whatever conspiracy theory you want to talk about that's going on the reality is we know from scripture that Rome is the one that's R ruling the world and pulling the strings from the Vatican and so you know regardless of how you want to look at that then secondarily we also know what brother Bram said that there's going to be a covenant between the Antichrist and the Jews and America remember the way he brings that together we'll look at that in more detail I'm just trying to set set sort of a scene as we go into this is is we have the true Jew who is the elected who is going to hear and receive the message of the two witnesses then you have what brother brandham calls the Wall Street Jew and that opens up a whole uh uh another topic to look into and look into history and the different ones and even the ones that were so uh adamant about uh reinstating the state of Israel were not Believers we're not looking for the scriptures to come to pass many of them were global banking Elite families the Ross Childs Etc these are those Wall Street Jews that brother bandam speaks about and again that is a a rabbit hole that I warn everyone about not jumping into because it goes It goes so deep and there's so much to it brother Brandon brought it out to us in a very simple way and if we know history of the last 70 80 years 100 years we you could see those things exactly God will use even the worst atheist to bring his word to pass and that that's that's one of those families there amongst many of the the Jewish Wall Street Bankers that have sought control over the world and manipulation over the world working no doubt together with the Catholic Church behind the scenes so again we look at Jews and we see uh in our I'm saying this to get to our current climate that we have is you see many political commentators beginning to question why America stands with the nation of Israel and why why are why are they why are we spending so much money when we have our own problems in order to help and fund Israel and this is going to be the natural direction that things go because we know that all nations will stand against Israel and even many Christians are starting to say well this whole dispensational theology that views Israel as being restored is wrong the church actually replaces uh Israel and oh they have they'll bring you this scripture and this scripture but they're not going to bring you all of Romans 9:10 and 11 the in in one sense it the church replaces Israel in another sense neither replaces either if we look at God's economy and God's plan he had a he had a purpose of raising up Israel and he still has not accomplished that purpose so unless we think that God is going to fail and not bring his word to pass then there has to be a restoration of Israel there has to be a King set upon the throne to rule over that nation and rule over all the nations from Jerusalem God hasn't forgotten that God hasn't replaced heaven with Jerusalem and now Jesus this is the post-millennial Jesus is ruling the Earth through his church the post-millennial and the amillennial view that brother brandham talks about in the church ages book we're not going to have a literal Millennium it's a just a spiritual millennium wherein Christ rules the Nations through his church but as we find and look through the seven churches of Revelation which is our only prophetic view only only real prophetic view of the church Through the Ages what what do we see we see that the church slowly declines that there is a remnant of Overcomers but really at the end they're blind naked and don't know it amen the church actually goes downward not upward to rule the Earth but it actually ends just as Israel ended a Remnant believed a small Remnant believed and the rest were blind amen and God turned away from them to deal with the Gentiles and the we'll see that actually the reverse starts to happen in Romans in Romans 10: 11 the other portion that you want to think about is when we look at the times of the Gentiles we have two different things going on the minute that Israel was sent out from Jerusalem the the the the judaic kingdom the southern Kingdom the times of the Gentiles began right there was no long there was never again a Jewish Kingdom it was all through intermediaries they had government rulers and so forth but they had their overlords always above them except for maybe a few days under the the macbes but that was very short-lived and was wasn't uh maintainable but with that said it wasn't until 1948 and the battles that they faced in order to have their own sovereignty their own government up until that time it's been the times of the Gentiles that's politically speaking but then when you have him dealing turning spiritually and dealing with uh individuals that he calls out of the Nations that obviously happened uh starting with the church ages if we look at that closely we understand that there is a period of time between the crucifixion and the resurrection and the time when God turns when Paul at the end of the book of Acts close to 60 AD around 60 AD turns and says since you refused the gospel we turn and go to the Gentiles that that's a that's a critical time piece where God is turning away from Israel he gave them space excuse me to repent and to receive the Gospel that's what Peter is preaching every every time that he preaches and every time they preach to the Jews even Paul he first goes to the Jews in those places and he say do you want to repent you rejected the Messiah he's he's been raised from the dead do you want to repent they say no he said you've counted yourself Unworthy of eternal life so now we turn and deal with the Gentiles all right so we just laying that uh Foundation again and looking at Paul saying there's no difference under the gospel there's no difference between the Jew and the Greek whoever anyone who calls on the name of the Lord yes amen that's the only requirement is call on the name of the Lord and you'll be saying saved right it's not whether you're from this nation that Nation another Nation anyone on planet Earth that hears the gospel responds by faith repents follows the scripture acts 238 they are recipients of the Gospel amen and salvation again and Paul is going on is trying to show the gospel how then shall they call on him who they have not believed how how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things amen but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who has believed our report so then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God so this is this is leveling the playing field across the board it's not based on your heritage where you circumcised the eighth day is your family o obeying that obeying the law it is a preacher is sent he proclaims the good news you hear and you believe that's it kind Paul everywhere Paul went the Jew the Jews went behind him and said you have to Paul is mixed up you have to become a disciple of Moses first everywhere he went and this confrontation came in Antioch they said Jews came from James in Jerusalem and he they're saying we have to be circumcised and follow the law of Moses in order to be saved Paul says this is a problem let's go there goes directly to them they solve it they solve it out but I want I want to point out something is God did not need the approval of any of the elders or Apostles at Jerusalem he sent Paul when they were in Antioch they were in their PR ministers meeting prayer meeting the Holy Spirit fell and said what can you go to Jerusalem and ask if it's okay for Paul and Barnabas go to the Gentiles the Holy Spirit didn't ask for anybody's approval they didn't ask for the council to meet the Holy Spirit came and spoke and said separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the work where unto I've called them and what did he do he sent them to the Gentiles amen and what what message did Paul preach to come and believe the law come and come and become a disciple of Moses and then you can become a disciple of Christ is that how the Holy Spirit work Paul said to the Galatians this only would I learn of you did you receive the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith amen so God is himself chose a one born out of du season who fought against the disciples who hated them persecuted them even blasphemed the Lord Jesus by killing his disciples here he raises this man up sends them out and even they are bewildered by what he is doing and they come forward and it takes Peter to raise up and say hey don't you remember when I preached the gospel didn't the Lord the Holy Spirit did didn't ask me to make them Disciples of Moses first what did the Holy Spirit ask me to do he said don't call anything unclean that I have cleansed so Peter has to raise up and defend them instead well they write a letter uh don't eat meat strangled uh don't make sure the blood is drained from it how many do you do that why did you reject the Jerusalem Council because Paul said nothing is unclean and who was the Vindicated messenger of the age the Jerusalem Council or Paul again this is God's leadership of the Holy Spirit dealing with them faith comes by hearing you don't know how amazing this is we don't we don't grasp the grace and love of God hear my word respond to it and you're saved simple as that whe whether you're a Jew or whether you're a gentile that's it Verse 18 but I say have you have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the Earth and their words under the ends of the world but I say did not Israel know first Moses saith I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish Nation I will anger you so if they would have had in other words Paul is saying if they would have had a revelation of the scriptures they would understand God saving the the Gentiles should should open your eyes and make you repent amen didn't they know they they have Moses they can read what Moses said verse 20 but Isaiah is very bold and saith I I was found of them that sought me not I Was Made manifest unto them that ask not after me but to Israel he saith all day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gain SA people I say then has G has God okay here here's the question has God Cast Away his people because this is the Viewpoint that Christians are starting to take in this day in this in this in in this political environment and in this madness that's going around pro- Hamas Palestinian nonsense supporting terrorist yeah so then I asked the question has God Cast Away his people God forbid may it never be is what Paul is saying for I also am an Israel of the Seed of Abraham of the tribe of Tribe of Benjamin God has not Cast Away his people which he fornew or which he for ordained what ye not what the scripture saith of Isa Elias how he maketh inter intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life but what sayith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have bowed not bowed the knee to the image of Baal amen even so then at this present time also there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace and if by grace then is no more of Works otherwise Grace is no more Grace but if it be of works then it is no more grace otherwise work is no more work in other words there's a predestinated seed that's going to come to Salvation amen there's there's a Remnant there even at the time of Paul there was a Remnant there that would receive the grace of God what then Israel has not obtained that what he that which he seeks for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded according as it is written God has given them the Spirit of Slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day so it's not every single member of the nation of Israel that will be saved only the elect will obtain it that's true for all of history right Paul is not bringing anything new anything different he's trying trying to point out you guys are so infatuated with the nation of Israel and being part of Israel but you're not remembering the fact that even through all the ages it's only the elect y'all have been stubborn he's he's one of them we've been stubborn this whole time God has constantly been reaching his hand out and we've constantly rejected and turned turned against him but who obtains salvation the elect right am and and David saith let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense unto them let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back always I say then have they stumbled that they should fall again it's a question have they stumbled to the point where they've fallen and they'll never rise again I think that's that's the essential idea that Paul is looking at have they stumbled that they should fall they've stumbled and then the way we look at it they fell but not in the not in the sense that this is it this is the end God forbid he says but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy all right so through their fall from the Grace from from their rejection of the Messiah what happens salvation comes to the Nations the reason why he turned away from Israel was not because he hated Israel he was done with Israel he was turning from Israel to S to take a people for his name's sake from among the Nations to do what was the purpose what is his purpose of doing that even that purpose was to fulfill his plan which is to provoke them to jealousy that they would repent now if the fall of them be the rich es of the world and the diminishing of them The Riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness how much more Israel's fullness will be a blessing so if their fall is a blessing how much more their restoration will be a blessing and the Fulfillment of God's purpose for them will be a blessing for I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles I magnify my office if by any means I may Pro provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall be the receiving of them be but life from the dead amen so think about that when the r when the Rapture happens what does God do the Rapture happens immediately he's turned to the back to the nation of Israel for if the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches wow all right so the the tree the fruit the lump and the branches all right and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild Olive Tree were Graft in among them and with them partak us of the root and fatness of the Olive Tree boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee so again this is this is the root of this is the tree The Olive Tree he's saying that the natural branches are what Israel the natural branches are what they're cut off if we take this back to another place as we know that branches that don't bear fruit are cut off are per purged right so he's purged them off because they refused to Bear the fruit of the Messiah so he's cut them off and he's taken us we're just grown out in the wild there he's taken us wild Nations Gentiles and graft us into the tree of Salvation amen and we're not to boast we're not to say hey we're the we're now the branches Israel's finished is that exactly what these denominational people are doing they're boasting and saying we're the replacement we're the replacement Israel's finished how are you boasting God can take those it's God he can take a dead Branch laying on the ground put it back into a tree and bring life to it thou Willl say then the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in see how great I am I must have been so great in God's sight that he found me out in the wild and brought me in and put me no why are you boasting well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not high-minded but fear again this is looking at a prophetic picture this isn't looking at actual individuals this is looking at the prophetic picture of the of the Gentile bride and the spiritual nation of Israel not the not the natural Nation merely but the spiritual Nation so he's bringing these both both of these things one gets broken off he's committed them to blindness for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee behold therefore the goodness and sever let me pause for a second it it's important to understand this as a prophetic picture not as an individual if we understand understand this as an individual we would get the idea that well I can just and and will cut me off and then put someone else in there this isn't talking about that portion of Salvation you C if you have the Holy Ghost you're you're not going to fall in unbelief and be cut off because getting the getting the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul you're sealed until the day of your Redemption amen right so we can't look at the you can't take this scripture and begin to contradict other scriptures you have to understand it in the big picture God is going to wind up things for the Gentile bride God is going to restore back the nation of Israel to what he's dealing with spiritually he's already naturally restored them and we'll get into it later but the scripture shows that he'll restore them back to their Nation while they're still in unbelief and that once they're restored even in unbelief he will then spiritually give restore them and give that 144,000 the Holy Ghost AM behold therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise Thou shalt also be cut off again we we can't you don't take this and apply it to personal salvation because you you're not going to fall in unbelief and be cut off that's not how God operates once Christ has drawn you all that Jesus said all that the father has given me will come to me and I will in no wise cast them out right he said that he would not lose one of his Sheep amen so he's not going to graph you you were a pig now he transforms you to a lamb then you make a mistake now he turns you back to a pig no you're a sheep you're predestinated seed he has a he has a very specific purpose that he's coming to look for you as an individual to seal you with the Holy Ghost he's not going to change he doesn't does God change his mind about anything no so this is not speaking about that this is speaking about the big picture so the big picture is what the Jews slowly and steadily fell into unbelief until they were almost completely blind there was just a small remnant of Believers even to this day there's just a small Remnant in of true Jewish Believers what happens in the church ages the church what does it do almost right away as soon as the apostles are gone they start to fall away from the original faith it goes through such Darkness until God restores the church back begins at the Reformation to step by step bring this restoration but what happens at the at the LA at at the very end is the majority of the church World rejects the restoration message and so God has no nothing to do but Smite the Earth with the curse they've rejected the messenger and his message so God will then turn away from the Gentiles who've rejected that message he'll he'll take up the ones that have received that message and he'll turn back to the Jews through the two witnesses all right so this is what this is the idea that's he's going to cut off the Gentiles because they're in unbelief and he turns back to the Jews and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be grafted in for God is able to graft them in again for if thou W cut out of the Olive Tree which is Wild by nature and were grafted contrary to Nature into a good Olive Tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentile become in all right so there you go once the last this is where we come to this ideaa and understanding that when the last predestinated seed comes in he turns to deal with the the Jews see when the fullness when the the total number of the predestinated seed among the Gentiles to the bride body has been sealed by the Holy Ghost that's when God will turn and deal with Israel and so all Israel shall be saved as as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob don't have time to cover it but looking at that all Israel shall be saved now number one dealing with them as a nation sure but number two is it's 144,000 elected from each tribe but nationally he saves them how through those 144,000 there's much to cover when we go into this and we're out of time I better quit there let's stand Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your word we ask Lord that you be with us this morning you bless the worship help us to get ourselves get our thoughts out of the way Lord that we can focus upon you and remember we're not here for ourselves or for our own gratification Lord but we're here to worship and glorify you Lord and to
