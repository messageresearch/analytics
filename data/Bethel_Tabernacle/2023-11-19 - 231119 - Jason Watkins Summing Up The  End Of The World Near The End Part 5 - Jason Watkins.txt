can't seem to see the end of it amen so we're just going to keep on going amen I've um I've got got my quotes on the PowerPoint today to help me stay calm and collected amen praise the Lord amen it helps me of course my daughter-in-law Katie told me I was saying last week about the service I said yeah I had my Powerpoints and that kind of kept me you know from not blowing up she got she said yeah but then you read your your quote and you start freestyling I said okay never heard it called that but I'll take it amen praise the Lord so if we start freestyle and you'll know what's up amen tickled me Hebrews chapter 1 verse one God who at sundry times and in diverse manners that's times in the past times in history in diverse manners various ways spake in time pass unto the fathers by the prophets now I want you to really realize he's not saying the prophets spoke he's saying God spoke through the prophets all right that's a massive difference so now he says that was in the past all right now let's bring It Forward that was all prior to Calvary now let's go after Calvary the same God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world all right let's pray father we are remembering at this time our dear sister Linda and Lord the enemy father demons are tormentors and so we're praying for her Deliverance right now Lord we we see the the tyranny of the enemy and we pray against him Lord I Lift prayers with this audience today we pray against these plans of Lucifer Lord and I I issue this prayer and I ask that the Holy Spirit Lord rebuke the enemy he is a trespasser and that he turn loose God's Property that she may be well and painfree we commit it to you master in Jesus name now Lord take the word break it to us let it be the bread of life we commit our s into your hands just now and Lord I'm trying to take no thought of my own and I just want to rely on you and trust in you completely in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated so I I sincerely covet your prayers today and this thought has become so expansive as I studied it and it's a lot of what I want to say is quite um fresh to me not as a not as a New Concept per se but just in Greater levels of it can I say it that way deeper grasping of say in this hour how many believe we're right near the end man right near the Finish Line friends it's in it's impossible as a Bible believing uh Christian to believe that the world could have much more time on its on its calendar when that day is only God knows Jesus said that's something the father has in his own under his own care his own his own knowledge his own will uh he's bringing it all to pass but just know this that God does see a day God knows when that day is and we are simply told what what to look for and when we see certain things we will know that that that that event is very very near and I would say that it is so imminent today certainly it's more clear wouldn't be saying anything new or strange if I said that it's closer today than it's ever been That's goes almost without saying but I'm here to tell you friends when I look at prophecy and I see and and we looked at it in the 70s and we looked at it in the 80s 9 and te and 2000s and the teens and we're looking at it today I I can look I can actually look back with that hindsight and go my what we thought was so much of a prophecy then it today it's all that's almost not comparable you are right at the door you see there's no question in your mind there shouldn't be any question that the that Christ is not going to wait indefinitely to go back for his people Israel and he's going back to receive the elected Hebrews uh who are the true children of Abraham 144,000 elected Jews the ministry of Moses and Elijah if those if those are men Anointed with the ministry of Moses and Elijah which I lean toward and brother brandham lean toward uh then they're most certainly most assuredly on the Earth right now amen and I don't know what they are what they know or what they might be aware of you know I know that before I mean it it it we should be able to see that before the Angel's commission to take a prophet in a cave and give him his the an the Angelic commission I mean prior to that people knew bill brandham as a good clean gospel preacher a fine young man in the community who had who had broken the cycle of his family uh from living a life of sin and he had become a well-respected minister of the Gospel he had baptized many down on the Ohio River and and and that's all he knew about himself until now he knew there were strange things happening in his life but until an angel met him in a cave he didn't understand it so I don't know who might say how it might turn out down the road when when people are become Believers and followers of Moses and Elijah and if it happens to be men who are anointed with that Spirit they they might very well say you know I used to know this man as a very good uh Bible Bel uh believer of Moses and you you realize that the ministry of Moses and Elijah is to come aware that the Messiah has already come and when when when sacrifice when offerings have been reestablished and brother brandham said it will in the in the tribulation they will reestablish sacrifices the sacrificial lambs and Bulls and things and it will be Moses and Elijah who stand up and say no I know you think that's the Revival for Israel but it's not the Revival for Israel the Messiah it's time for the atonement amen and that will be their message friends and that's going to happen in real time in this earth it's right on the money it's right at the time and I'm here to tell you we know by the Bible they can't go until you go up they can't go forward and God's not going to wait indefinitely to go get them he's going to remove a bride from the earth this his prophecy so now then what becomes the ministry of the Bride right before I mean I mean you know you know this in fact is when you think about my about my about my sermon you know we're we're summing up things at the end time we're summing up the world we're we're coming to a conclusion God has laid it on my heart in this series to say listen we're not we're not trying to get our minds around something coming way down the yellow brick road I'm telling you right now we're in the wrapping up we're in the summation of everything we're in the climbing of everything he's been doing to have a gentile Bride for 2,000 years and you that's why we say constantly you are the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come do you believe that so then so then we need to know what's up we need to know what's his plan where do we stand what should we be at what level should we be at amen what should be happening in our midst now I I just want to say and you know I'm going to say some things today that you're guaranteed not to hear in the average Sunday morning pull pit and there'd be no way that I would say them or have the audacity to say them nor would I have the frankly I wouldn't have the authority to say them but I can say them to you because I'm going to read it a prophet's saying it am amen there'd be no chance there that's why we you know that's why we stand squarely on the teachings of the scripture I said I made this statement to bethl Tabernacle almost 30 years ago I said you need to understand you've elected me as Pastor I stand squarely on the scriptures as they are taught to us by God's Vindicated messenger we have not divvied we have not uh shunn that we have not shunn to declare unto you the whole counsil of God am and we intend to because it's the only message I've ever found that gives me reason and purpose and I understand why I'm here and I understand what's going on and it's the thing that banished all fear out of my life it's the thing that gives me peace and Harmony and makes my life uh uh Dov tail with the Holy Spirit answers so many questions that the world is groping in anxiety and fear over today because they don't have the answers we have and they don't believe the answers if you tell it to them even they would rather it's it's shocking that people would rather have stay with their anxiety than to accept your cure the medicine we have is a cure to fear it casts it out it's a it's the it's the wherewithal to have the love of God in your home and in your families it's the it's the access to the supernatural because it it doesn't make you a super person it it but it connects you to a super person see and then that person connect in Supernatural not just natural ways but Supernatural ways and we're not ashamed of the Gospel it's the power of God under salvation God Paul is showing us here how that God had now spoken let me have my PowerPoint dubs and uh just that um perfect stay right there I'll I'll take it from there so God had now spoken directly through his son now now I'm gonna I'm going to give this to you in pieces because and every next piece is going it's going to take us a little further and a little further and a little further and I'm doing that on purpose because I don't want you to get lost in the shovel I don't just want to jump to the cut to the chase I want to show you the the structure of how God has done it Paul helps us here with the ancient days God in in sunary times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers we saw such a a display of that in the Youth Camp skit where you know it was to God the same God spoke to different people in different ways but it was always the same God amen and it always ended up with the same uh effect life life I want to I want to tell you something friends don't don't hesitate when God's word comes to you and speaks to you and says make this change stop this do that go here have this don't don't don't interfere with that just say yay Lord amen say yay and amen to every word because it is that word and your acceptance and your cooperation in the vision that brings life his vision for you is life and what does it matter you know this life you know what what have I to fear if God hath comprehension you know just because I don't know everything and just because it's not a flowery bed of ease and just because you know he doesn't he doesn't you know he's not like Santa Claus coming into our wish list that we give him in prayer but I know this that everything he touches becomes life in my life and everything and the more I can surrender the more that I can surrender the lighter my load Hallelujah believe that more that I release myself the more he takes control Hallelujah so God had spoken directly through the prophets in times past but he wasn't going to stay at that it lasted a long time amen but it wasn't going to stay like that he eventually came and stood on the earth in a human body and now God is speaking directly through his son as a human am born of a woman say why why are you emphasizing that brother Jason because that's something he had never done up to that point ever not even in Eden had he done that see he Jesus is the only begotten of the father am not even in Eden had he done that now all right the brothers and I have been en enjoying our Series going through spoken word is original seed and boy things brother Brenham said in that and then the questions and answers he had directly after that uh not too much later and he's getting asked some more questions about it and and things that he said in there and then he he comes all the way into 64 and 65 and saying the same things again and again and again uh we we find that that there would it Eden would have gotten to God speaking God living in humans speaking but sin interrupted that amen un you understand Eve would have had she not ran ahead she would have eventually come to that God had said to them be fruitful and multiply and here's a here's a point that I'm a little bit out of my line but I just think it would help you now when brother brandham and cod is asked about the you know the the the the whole thing of Genesis 1 128 we're not going to turn to it but Genesis 128 was where he he said to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and brother brandham is emphasizing those conjunctions and and and and be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and have dominion and and subdue it and brother brandham ties that all the way through human existence that it's it's going to be first of all for God to say multiply then God already knew brother bandam shows us on tape God already knew there's no way to multiply unless something dies you live by dead substance your body multiplies cells because you consume things that died you know and and this was brother bram's argument to the silliness of people who said you know you you should only eat vegetables perfectly healthy diet but but you know but it's not a command in the Bible because and and and and people who do it for health sake are awesome but sometimes you get these activists who just want to almost send you to hell because and brother brandham they tried to say brother brandom how could you eat meat and brother brandom he said why would I not he saidwell something died and brother brandom says ' well you live by dead substance' said if if you eat if you live at all you live because something died so oh no I don't eat animals said well you eat wheat the wheat died you eat potatoes the potato died you eat whatever you eat something had to die we only live by dead substance and that was a perfect type in Shadow of the fact that there was no way to have eternal life unless something died so that we could live so so then that means that Calvary was not God figuring it out as he went along Calvary when God let me tell you something when God created the whole world and mountains and pushed up from volcanoes God had his eye on one lowly small hill before man ever set foot on the earth God saw a small hill and knew someday I'll have a use for that hill Oh Hallelujah friends that's the one you're connected to that's the one who knows everything the end from the beginning and so he he would have he would have come to it she would have come to that but she she interrupted the program brother bam says but you come anyway now say oh yeah see God's plan got got ruined God's plan got Advanced God's plan got Advanced you never look at God as losing you never look at God as he's lost a battle or something caught him off guard I'm so glad to know that I'm so glad to know that that means that no wonder Paul could say nothing could separate me from him because the one who knew all the mistakes I would ever make love me anyway and chose me anyway and and just because I get knocked down doesn't mean he's defeated and in fact is all I got to do is get back up repent dust myself off and then I'm not defeated i' I've said I've said to you know to people who who enjoy sporting records I'm 60 and0 I'm 6 and0 I've never been defeated in battle I'm 60 and0 brother Isaiah you know why because I say have you got knocked down lots of times I'm probably you know I'm probably uh probably my my losses would way out Pace my knockdowns would way out Pace you know the times I blasted the devil in the mug he's blasted me a bunch more times and knocked me flat on my back far more times than I I'm sad to say that but at the same time I'm still not defeated he's defeated every time Christ allows me to get back up on my feet Satan is defeated all over again say oh to what degree brother brandham said when you BR take a sin or a trespass and you repent and that and the Bible says if we if we repent he's faithful and just to forgive us he said he he he takes that sin and casts it in the sea of forgetfulness and the guilt of it goes back on the head of the devil every time I fall he's defeated every time I fall I get back up again and I plan to never stop getting back up again am I'm headed for a land where I won't fall again so we find that sin had its great Interruption whoops keep cutting it off so now we're coming to part five and we've been talking about the logos becoming the Rema this is the established word anytime it gets anointed in the life of God's family it's Rema word it's the same word it's only in a different a different uh it's a different form it's a different um connotation it's a different uh it's a it's a further understand Isaiah said a virgin would conceive but when Mary actually did it it was further understand that was established word in Isaiah but when Mary actually did it when Mary was told by the angel cuz the angel didn't tell her anything but what was already in the word and but what what what was unique was that the angel wasn't just repeating scripture because Mary already believed the Old Testament but what she had to say uh what she had to uh agree with was that that prophecy means you that this this logos is going to be you and she said so be it unto me and at that point word that had been 700 years old became alive and became current how do you get something 700 years ago current because the bride says Amen to every word and Mark 16 comes alive today Hebrews 13 comes alive today oh I'm here to tell you John pinned 2,000 years ago that he seen a great host and he heard a great shout and he saw great people standing on a mountain but some day we're going to become that word hallelujah 2,000 year prophecy will become literal so we're taking our subtopic as a piece off of the Masterpiece brother Bram talking about Michelangelo's sculpture of Moses and brother brandham contrary to the rest of the world brother brand said to me the the flaw they saidoh this was his Masterpiece but it's got a little flaw here because he lost it and hit it brother brandham said the flaw is what made it a masterpiece not how wonderfully it was crafted how authentic it looked that it was Michelangelo himself that the detail was so fine that I mean listen friends there there was there was lots of sculptors in the world who could have done that also so brother Brandon was not not saying it's of such a high quality reproduction of Moses that this is what makes it a masterpiece brother M said no to me it's the flaw because it was because it was the flaw that struck the Lord Jesus it was the it was that day on Calvary it was the wound in his side The Thorn on his head the nails in his hands and feet oh let me tell you something friends and he said a piece flew off of that and he said and you it has an indent today it has an indention today where you can feel where that flaw that piece flew off so when brother brandham says to me that's what made it a masterpiece that makes perfect sense to me because the thing to me that makes it a masterpiece is that there's another piece off of the Masterpiece so I had a masterpiece that day on Calvary but I came out of him I'm a piece off of the master peace hallelujah oh I'm here to tell you something friends there's no Lord like the Lord Jesus so brother brandham says here now before the foundation of the world when God created You In His Image or created The Man In His Image and created the woman the image of the man for the glory of the man he made you theophany just like himself when he said let us to the creatures that he had made let us make man in our image and our likeness a theophany God had never become flesh yet he was in a theophany right so I've said to you he spoke in Jesus Christ a man born of a woman he spoke directly through him he had never done that all the way back to Eden see watch said well eventually Adam got the flesh right but Adam still wasn't born of a woman Adam was the son of God but the second Adam was the only begotten Son of God see it's all God with his plan for Redemption to save a lost Humanity because that's why I said when Satan did what he did in the Garden of Eden God didn't lose that wasn't a subtraction that was an advancement because that the fall in the garden allowed God to now become a redeemer and so everything the devil's ever done to try to upset the the plan of God all it's ever done is Advance the kingdom see we would say today wow how tragic that brother brandham would would would to God that he could still be among us his loss Advanced the kingdom yes what else would you believe that Satan sucker punched God and took his Prophet out his loss say that was terrible how Paul had to die that advanced the kingdom John had to go to to the island of patmas get his eyes punched out be boiled in oil that advanced the kingdom the people were scattered all over that advanced the kingdom see watch now so he was in a theophonic had to become flesh first amen thus what all right now so I just want to make a statement to you all right man could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden that eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first so Christ and Satan are both in the garden we know that neither one of them are in flesh Satan first of all he's really up against it cuz he can't even create but he but there's a serpent that God created who had a place for a soul but he didn't have a soul but he had a place for one and so Satan took that place and now the serpent can suddenly rationalize and reason and think see now he has a conscience so and and so Satan now what's Satan trying to do get to flesh what's what's Christ trying to do get into flesh because what's the what's the plan there's a kingdom coming that the Lord is just starting and he's he's he's building out a future Kingdom that's going to be filled with people who are in bodies not just theophanies even he wasn't going to stay just theophany he wanted a body a body has thou prepared me he said beh it is written in the Scrolls concerning me I have come to do thy will oh God a body has in sacrifices and offerings thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me so so we find that that what's in play if neither Christ nor Satan are in the flesh in the garden then what's in play brother Jason something here's what's here's what was in play it was going to be something that was going to happen in the flesh cuz after a while God put Adam in flesh and then took Eve out of him in flesh and then Satan comes and gets in the serpent in now he's in flesh animal flesh not a human very close to the human see upright could talk could think I I I it it makes us laugh when we see artistic artist depictions of a snake hanging in a tree talking that's silly that's childhood nonsense see and it wasn't a snake he was more subtle than any beast of the field the thing could talk and think and walk around and could actually and could actually have carnal knowledge with a human woman it's not a snake like you would see today crawling on the ground all right so so we find he's the missing link God cursed his body and so when we realize that what's in play you don't you you have Christ and Satan in the Garden of Eden neither one of them are in flesh but what's in play is that something is going to happen in flesh influenced by one of these two trees amen they both came with a word one was true the other was false am and so so this is why brother Brandon would say when God said multiply he already knew that that nothing could multiply unless something died so even in Genesis 1:28 even before they're in flesh you're finding that God already had redemption in his mind and he's saying multiply well if something wait a minute how am I going to do that something's got to die yeah but you'll understand it better by and by just follow my word this you understand this was all a planen that God could foresee down in the future and brother Brenham actually shows us that that goes all the way that and and and and and he said see that come all the way up out of the garden it went all the way through the Old Testament and what were they doing and multiplying and and replenishing and taking a stand for the word of God God's family God in Sund Dr time spoke through the prophets what were they doing they were and Prophets spoke and more prophets and people believed you understand the kingdom is being built until it comes into to Jesus Christ and he stands in a human body is he finished no sir he's going to he said a little while the world won't see me but you will cuz I will be not just with you but I'll be in you that was the promise of the Jubilee Israel refused it the Gentiles took it and the Holy Ghost fell in the upper room and now that same God was living in human bodies again to to what degree even their sh Shadow was healing people amen so brother Ram said it's just and this and that and this and and brother Brenham says and have dominion so brother Brenham says that goes all the way out to the Millennium amen so this be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowls of the air over every living thing that creepeth upon the Earth so so you find that God has a plan I'm here to tell you something friends you're on your way to the Millennium hallelujah it's Unstoppable the word is taking you there Hallelujah so brother B goes on thus what God worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan I mean this is everything this is the fall this Tak it all in his predestinated plan see because there was no way that the tree of life could be partaken of directly because it had to first become flesh that's part of God's plan see thus what God worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan and when Satan had brought about that which was I love that language when Satan had defeated God and won the kingdom did I read that right when when Satan became the champion and beat God down and took his family and took all of his power when Satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of God can I say it this way when the puppet brought the plan that was necessary for you you say thank you puppet then man could not get to the Tree of Life In The Garden certainly not now look at that phrase it wasn't time so that that immediately informs your thinking that it's eventually going to be time it's just not right there in Genesis you understand you're with me but an animal animal had caused the fall had it not let the let animal life be shed was taken the animal was taken and his blood shed and then God had communion with men with man again it's mankind then there was to come a day when God would appear in flesh who would God would appear in flesh and by means of his humiliation he would restore Fallen man and make him a partaker of that eternal life so you are Hees of God and you are joint heirs with Christ see so because you're you're in the same family and you have received his life into your life so as an air of God you you differ nothing from a a servant though you be Lord of all because you're an heir of God before you were ever born again you were already a child of God Amen you but but in but in application you differed nothing nothing from everybody else you were just a ranked sinner see but God rich in Mercy loved us right so so we find out that as an heir yes you were an heir of God but you had you had nothing allotted to you there was an allotment but it wasn't allotted to you because you were in sin but now we have become joint heirs with Christ now there's not only an allotment of eternal life but it's allotted to you and you're a possessor of that eternal life amen you with me so he's going to make him a partaker of that eternal life my goodness time is zooming on me it's okay I'm just G to carry on along I'm trying not to Freestyle all right let me get to where I need to be all right so so then we come here to Christ is the mystery of God revealed tremendous tremendous message it's one you need to hear about 20 times look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation amen see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do friends I don't know what happened to you this week but do you see what God is trying to do I have no way to forecast what next week holds for you but just remember it's God doing something something Hallelujah I mean that just takes the whole that just deflates as brother brandham said de horns the devil no wonder I say to you he ain't nobody because it doesn't even matter if he get what if he gets what looks like a victory and even if you're culpable in it it still doesn't matter it's just advancing God's plan wow see it's it's it's it's what God is trying to do what is the new birth then you'd say well brother brandham what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen see not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you set a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules it's not about your wins and losses or that you live legalistically a perfect Flawless life it's not about that see you you didn't do you didn't really do anything other than what Mary did and believe the word am yes amen you say should I have done more than that no because if you did more than that then that gives you glory and that's not what the plan's about the whole thing is for His glory so he puts a piece of himself in you then sends a piece of himself to match the piece of himself and this says the word and you say amen and this is logos and this becomes Rema and you go forth as a son and daughter of God you did nothing to earn it you did nothing to keep it you can't get away from it it chased you down and in some cases knocked you down and if you're still running it will knock you down see but Christ watch but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ see Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon I'm so glad you know there's there's some of you here today who I'm the only Pastor you've ever known you were your parents were single and part of my youth group and then the Lord joined them together and they had children and I dedicated you to the Lord at this very at this altar or maybe in the A-frame or somewhere else but that's not the Story of All of Us amen some of us we didn't always have a pastor or a priest brother brandham says doesn't matter Pastor priest whatever it was some of us didn't have a pastor or a priest who always operated with our best interest in mind am amen but we kept going yes sir for some of us life happened in ways boy I have to say Amen to this that could have finished me could have finished us come on life has happened in ways that should have finished us amen hard Curves in the road that not could have or should have it would have finished us but somehow we're still here somehow we kept going sometimes we drove off the road ourselves but some power h than my own Reckless will brought me back on the road every time Hallelujah who keeps saving me who keeps saving us who keep say to this who keeps saving me and then say right behind it not me who keeps saving you not you there's something higher than you that's known you your entire life and and and and as brother Matt reminded us this Wednesday you know we're in this race friends H we're not racing our fellow brothers and sisters you know who we racing the devil and guess who wins me you not only am I racing I'm going to win hallelu hallelujah it's Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself see see see you see that is that is that easy look at it again it's Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it's it it expresses itself that's God's purpose for Jesus Christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his laws fulfill his law by death that's that's exactly why he came and Christ God died in flesh and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself see that's God's purpose for Jesus Christ was to are we we we I'm sorry I'm reading the wrong one and Christ God died in flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only his word of God you see that's that's what Eve failed on she stopped believing every word of God Amen she had the word of God but she let some other manifestation In the Flesh talk her out of it that's exactly what Israel did the same thing that Adam found in his bride Jehovah found in his bride and they came to Samuel and said make us a king and it broke Samuel's heart and he says God is your king they said fine God is our King but we want another we want like everybody else has it just shows that they were only mental Believers their heart wasn't really their heart was far from God they wanted modernization and it broke Samuel's heart and God come to him and said Samuel they haven't rejected you they've did what Eve did to Adam they've rejected me they have taken another man to rule over them oh my this is exactly what Jesus ran into and when in the church ages the the the early church had the perfect word they were perfect for a couple of decades they had the Jubilee amen they had the Feast of Pentecost they had the token they had the abstract title they had rapturing Faith they had the pillar of fire they had prophets and apostles amen now they they couldn't go into the Rapture although they were they perfectly could have except for the fact that the seed to fill out the type had to go into the ground because there was more names on the book then was just in that first age my name was in that book so he he he couldn't let them go in the Rapture but they could have until they started to backslide oh my friends and by the time so now instead of Christ being able he comes to get his bride at NAA he finds her just like Eve did like Adam did just like Jehovah did now Christ finds his bride defiled she's taken another man instead of Christ the word am and instead of Christ being able to take a bride home he now must sit down in the eternities and under the ministry of the Son of God start interceding as a high priest on behalf of the ignorance he seals up the word under Seven Seals and wraps it all up and not becomes an encrypted mystery and they probe at it look at it and guess at it and live by it and a partial seal opens and a messenger catches it just enough light people run with it he he saves his family out of there but it's filled with all kinds of errors but at the end time the alpha would become the Omega what was at the first would be at the last and this time there's a bride on the earth who doesn't have any more ages and will not fail she's predestinated to not fall like Eve or like Israel or like the first church she's going to to finish this thing see so he says he died in the flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only in the word of God and not swap it like Eve did for intellectual conceptions of man you see it that's Christ's idea that's God's idea the new birth reveals this amen amen and he goes right back then what does the new birth produce watch Jesus said Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe uh see this is this is actually this takes in when he said be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth have dominion then brother brandom I didn't read it for you there in 1954 when he's breaking all that down he comes about five or six paragraphs under that and he goes to 1 Corinthians 12 because 1 Corinthians 12 there's this whole debate over the gifts of the Spirit as brother Matt was talking about Wednesday night but I'm here to tell you the holy go the plan of the Holy Ghost is he was always to have control of those gifts it was never supposed to be under the control of people and every time people have tried to usurp it it's always been a mess I'm here to tell you something friends every time anybody's ever rose up to try to bring on the make the third pole come ahead of its time try to make it a Doctrine try to make it a movement try to make it a gift try to make it a supernatural try to make it a shout try to make it try to make it try to make it all it does is cause confusion and leave people disillusion you don't need to worry in his time he's making all of this beautiful God is bringing it forth the only our only obligation as I preached to you some months ago your oblig ation is dedication and consecration it's not for you to try to make it happen it's to you to be dedicated and consecrated and God will make happen what he wants to make happen then every Power is subject to you then the token can be applied to your home then you take every Spirit under your control for the glory of God it doesn't come because you're smart or because you're you're energetic or because your charismatic has nothing to do with any of that it's about a humble life broken before God and surrendered in everything so that God can move and God can get Glory it's casting out devils and speaking with tongues and all these great manifestations of gifts that would follow that they shall not they may be they ought to they will am the Life of Christ in the church will produce these things in God's time in God's way he doesn't need you to help him he doesn't need counsel or advice from you all he needs is a surrendered heart amen you know I I had to learn that through a lot of tough Trials of you know brother bradam talks about it how that pastors go through a lot of things the church never knows nothing about says and brother brandom just actually kind of cracks open the secret vault and says you know I know brother Neville goes through a lot of things y'all don't know about I happen to know it and he said sometimes you look in the word of God and you see the promise and you preach it to the people and then it looks like it doesn't come to pass and people hang on to it and believe it and you trumpet it and and then it seems to fall and fail and he says these things you know we don't always understand these things but you know I I I learned from the Lord one day and I and I was I was looking at that scripture same one brother brandham you know I if you say to this mountain there or another one if you ask anything in my name and don't doubt it but believe that what you have said you shall receive then you shall have it see and and I and and and you know we had a an 18mon long episode and and six of our dearest Saints sleep now uh in beneath the sod and they're in heaven amen and here we were as a church praying testifying believing six out of six times and six out of six times the Lord took them home was real close to my heart two of them was my family and I just knew and even even with my baby Brethren I'm saying I mean there's no way to to tell you the feeling when it's it's 4:00 a.m. my phone rings and it's brother Andrew and I'm thinking oh goodness something must be wrong and I'm talking to brother Andrew and I'm trying to get awake thank God it was brother Andrew that is such a comfort to me to this day that it was brother Andrew telling me this and not just some cold doctor somewhere and he's saying brother Jason your brother was brought in oh my well what's going on brother Andrew how is he said well and he just so so just as kindly as he could he said brother Jason he's deceased and I just fell in a chair I couldn't believe it and you know the story and and then we got to gather a whole family on a Sunday morning and go and break the news to sister Jean and I've never heard my mom wh like that never in my whole life never heard her wh like that to lose a baby who had only lost a husband of 60 plus years only 13 months prior and sister Jean is going around the funeral comforting other people people say to me how's your mom I say my mom's a superhero I don't even understand her I can't figure it out where that kind of strength comes from and she has her sad times and her times of crying but I asked her one time I said Mom how how are you okay you know and she said look I have my times of crying she said but I have to be okay and I said what does that even mean what do you mean you have to be okay she said Jason I am not the first daughter of God to lose a husband and a child down through thousands of years my fellow sisters have lost husbands and children and she said and they kept pressing the battle she said I'm pressing the battle I have to be okay I'm here to tell you some friends we've all had our ups and downs but I I'm going to be okay and the devil can do whatever he wants but we're going to be okay because we're pressing and marching to Zion amen and and I stood there I was a couple days later and I was talking to the Lord I said Lord by this time I'm so broken I can't believe it how many have been lost and all of us praying and confessing and I said but Lord I I believe that you told me that my brother would be saved I believe you told me that and the Lord said I did save him and the only way I could cuz God wouldn't force himself and so he took my brother home a a wayward son and brother brandham said you you he said you mothers it's right on tape he said you got a wayward child all right here he said you take the same faith that you believe for your own salvation and you apply it to that child he said that wayward child and you just start confessing it and you start believing it don't you never change it and said if you die and you never see it in your lifetime you never see it happen said on the res Resurrection when you come up that faith will still be burning in your heart cuz death changes nothing and God will have to answer to that Faith at that time and bring them in oh I'm telling you there's power in the blood there's power in your testimony to believe God Amen and after preaching a funeral here what do we average every few months six people over 18 months that's about every 3 months we're preaching a funeral and I'm in my back office and I'm just broken by it and I just said Lord You're G to have to help me because something in my faith is broken now I don't mean my faith in the word of the message I'm talking about that not talking about my confession in Christ and the message of the hour that that's impossible Satan would I would die before I would ever see because that's a part of me I'd have to deny my own existence I'm talking about my faith to believe in the promise if you ask anything and my name don't doubt it and I was asking the Lord that but Lord you know you said if I ask anything in your name and don't doubt it and we didn't doubt it we confessed it and we believed it the Lord is so amazing come right down in that office right back there where he's the pastor sit right down across from me like you've done many times said how many many times have you counseled families parents sitting in this very chair and I'm suddenly I'm I'm in another place and I'm having a conversation and I'm looking at a chair and I said many times Lord he said you you've counseled fathers and mothers with children and wayward children and or problems in the home or problems in finances or problems in the marriage between the husband and the wife and problems with juveniles and problems with this and and that the other yes Lord yes many times I thought where's this going and the Lord just said to me have you ever had anyone sitting in these chairs have you ever sat a father and a mother down in front of you and said to them I think that you should let the children run the home amen have you ever said to a father or mother you know my opinion is you should let the children make the decisions I already knew where this was headed I bowed my head I said no Lord I've never never would I think of such a thing I would never tell a set of parents I would never tell a father you need to let the child make the decisions for the home I said I would never do I've never done that I would never do that he said then why do you question me am I not your heavenly father Yes Lord you are then do you think I should let my children run the kingdom and make the decisions that was such a healing to me but now I still had a question and when I got God close I try to gently ask my questions and so I just said I felt like Abraham like I know I'm taking my life into my hands please don't be angry with me I'll speak once more I said but Lord then okay I get it I understand I get it but why did you say that then if that's how you were going to roll why did you say it like that say what you said that if I ask you the father anything in your name and don't doubt it but believe that I that I'll receive it then I'll have it and that Gentle Savior spoke right back to me and said because the reason I said it that way is because that's how I want you to believe it every time you pray healing is an understatement regeneration is an understatement I felt like I could run I felt like John Dan I want to run oh friends there's no kind of healing like comes in the word of God I'm here to tell you something friends let this word be your guide let God have control of your life stop doing like Paul kicking against the prick stop running try stop trying to figure it all out God's in control Matt can I give a little bit of your testimonies so I'm gonna tell you a little story you have to understand that to me he's he's Mammy so he was a cute little button of a boy when I first met him little guy and uh Katie thinks he's adorable still Brainiac from five years old you know by the time he was seven the family quit challenging him on on things because he was too smart so he goes off to college heads off there to those uh liberal think tanks and propaganda machines listen up Ry listen up this will help you and after years of that nonsense it's even pushing against his raising this is why it's so important to raise them in the word in the way that they should go that alone brother Dale and sister Joanne's daily weekly monthly yearly practice of Prayer in the home and opening the Bible and reading and teaching that made my job so much easier because I was dealing with a young man who had been raised on the word now three four years probably four years of of liberal woke IND doctrination had his mind in a confusion and I I I hear that he's not he's back he's not doing good I said oh my goodness hard to believe and so I I called him hey Ma can we get together sure brother Jason and so you know I'm I'm praying and I hear that wow it's it's it's worse than you think you just better be prepared and what and I I couldn't hardly imagine that that that liberal institution had almost turned our brother into an atheist now they wouldn't have succeeded the Lord was always going to win the battle but his mind was in such a confusion and and and I'm praying a couple days before I meet him and I'm praying talking to the Lord Lord and I said Lord I'm going to be up against it I'm going to need your help and the Lord came down just like he did in the office now I'm in my home office and sat right down in front of me and said okay here's his problem cut right to the chase don't bother with anything else his problem is on the sovereignty of God just explain it to him out of the Bible because he's struggling with God's sovereignty and election and salvation and Redemption and God is sovereign happens to be one of my favorite subjects it's deals with election an election based on origin and I and I said okay Lord that's easy enough that's one of my favorite subjects I love talking about that and you know the whole argument that if if there's a God then why is there suffering and if there's and if he car either either he doesn't care or maybe he's evil himself to allow you know that's the whole demonic rant and Matt had seen too much Supernatural to just he couldn't let go that there is a real God I know I've seen him in my home my family my dad's Ministry and he had had experiences himself with the Lord so now there's this this battle and all I had to do all I had to do the Lord just told me what the problem was and I just had to go into the scriptures and start him at Genesis didn't we mat we started we just I just walked him through the Bible because I knew he believed it see I was already ahead cuz his mom and dad had raised him to believe this book so all I had to do my job was easy I just started going in Genesis and went right all the way through and showed him the sovereignty of God the plan of God election by origin brought him right down to the Book of Revelation and he he sat back in his chair as intellectual people often do and he said H that's very clear he said I've I've never realized it was so clear and that's that solved his problem here but the real crisis was at a deeper level and the Lord told me what the crisis was told told me what to say verbatim and said don't say this until the end so we're sitting there the intellectual part was really not hard because he believed this book all I had to do was prove it to him but now I knew there was something still in his heart and what it was is what the same problem we all had we had many experiences with God but we needed that certain something that certain something that once it happened there would never be you'd be sealed in and Satan sealed out and there'd be nothing could ever shake you you're not persuaded in it's a like brother brandham said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you so so funny because I knew what was gonna happen and he's still sitting there and I've answered his question and I said I said now Matt there's really another issue here oh yeah said you know you're you're struggling with with the message you're struggling you're you're taught to believe it you're trying to believe it you want to believe it but the devil has told you so many things in these four years have just decimated your faith can that happen I just confess to you it happened to me in that back office it can happen to you and and it and I mean it happened to John John in prison said send a message and ask Jesus are you he or do we look for another amen see so that's all that's all that's happening here's a here's a Son of God and the devil's got him in a in a in a in a whirlwind and I and I just said Matt I said look doctrinally speaking the message is simple to prove it's so scriptural it's easy I never worry about questions never worry about the Heathen raging the heathen's always going to rage determined unbelievers aren't going to believe anyway but if a gene of God is there they'll see it and that's a confidence I have but I said Matt there there's there's no need I you know you've been raised and and anything I could argue you doctrinally you already know anyway and it would just be rehearsal I said' now with the sovereignty thing you had never heard it put like that you told me and that once it had it explained like that then you got it see and I said but Matt you're more of a Believer than you realize you are this kid is looking at me like huh said oh yeah you're more of a Believer you're in fact is you're one of the most Believers around and I said because and here was my bomb I said you're in love with a product of this message there's a redheaded girl who you are crazy about and ready to marry and she is the manifestation of the message you're in doubt and I said the fact that you love her she's the manifested word is greater evidence than you believe the written word I had never personally seen I've I've I've I've had times where thank God it's not in a human but in in hunting I've seen the light go out they say the light goes out in your eyes I've seen that happened to animals and deer and and I put one down one time and I had only wounded it and I had to finish it quickly and I knew a next shot would finish it quickly and it didn't I watched the light first time I'd ever seen it in the woods light went out of its eyes and it was gone but I had never seen the light come on in someone's eyes and I'm looking at the face of a young man that I had been looking at since he was like that high and I literally watched the light turn on that's hard to explain but I watched I watched something happen in his soul that God had been waiting for that moment to do and he stood to his feet he looked at me and I could see already and he said you could have started with that and I said no I couldn't I said I was strictly told what the problem was what the answer was and I and God gave me a secret bomb that told me I can't use it till the end we hugged we cried we wept we prayed I let him go 10:00 that night his family can't find him sister Joanne's worried SI where's Matt I said well I don't know he left the church office and this last I saw him nobody could find him till he comes bursting in at home and sister Joanne testifies to this day she said I don't know what you said to him brother Jason she said but a different man came into my home that night and she said he's never been the same since that hour and I said Matt where did you go he said brother Jason he said I got in my car and he said I just started driving and he said I people probably thought I was insane because I was just sobbing and then I'd hysterically be laughing then I'd be sobbing then I'd be hysterically laughing and I'm driving sobbing and then I'm hysterically laughing he said I just had to drive down to the down to the pier down near Frip and he said I've been walking around there all night laughing and crying laughing and crying laughing and crying for all these hours I want tell you something friends this word has changing power and all all it takes is for you to say like Mary be it unto me according to Thy word why don't you stand with me today is that can that be your testimony today and say be it unto me according to Thy word so you know it's it's amazing how God was working in concert and God had his helpmate to be a helpmate before she was a helpmate amen and she keeps him on the straight and narrow today Amen brother Matt wasn't for sister Katie amen he wouldn't dress that sharp he wouldn't I mean none of it amen so we thank the Lord for sister Katherine brother Andrew two thumbs up buddy that was excellent excellent job it saved the day amen oh I got about 200 more parts to this m this sermon amen you can take that down Noah amen praise the Lord you love the Lord God bless you friends I I'm
