[9:11] something won't let me stop
[9:14] because there ain't nothing in me

[9:19] I was listening to a sermon yesterday
[9:22] and he was talking about three things
[9:24] that are
[9:25] very difficult to say
[9:28] I'm sorry
[9:31] I forgive you
[9:34] and Worcestershire sauce
[9:36] [Music]
[9:38] he actually said that I thought it was
[9:39] funny
[9:41] little levity didn't hurt nobody
[9:44] so we want to make sure we can say the
[9:46] first two
[9:48] the third one you can work on it at home
[9:52] praise the Lord love the Lord this
[9:53] morning
[9:54] you got burden on your heart just to get
[9:57] closer to God and those that you rub
[10:00] shoulders with my goodness you know I
[10:03] was talking to somebody she wouldn't
[10:04] want me to say that but
[10:07] Melissa is a witnessing tool
[10:11] wherever she goes rubs shoulders with
[10:14] people she works with they always come
[10:16] to her for prayer
[10:18] they always come to her and I met a man
[10:20] that I was working for and I was just
[10:21] like
[10:22] say something bye I prayed for him but I
[10:26] didn't say nothing at the moment
[10:28] but um anyway everywhere she's worked
[10:31] they've always um
[10:33] they knew she was a Christian amen
[10:36] that's what I would want wherever I go
[10:38] that they would know that there was
[10:40] something in me that was different from
[10:42] the rest of the world let's pray
[10:45] father I love you this morning
[10:48] and I thank you for your grace and mercy
[10:50] I thank you for your encouragement your
[10:53] inspiration father and Lord we thank you
[10:56] for your presence this morning we didn't
[10:58] come to see each other though we love
[11:00] each other Lord and we rub shoulders
[11:02] with each other edify each other
[11:05] the Lord would come to see you this
[11:07] morning
[11:09] Lord as our brother brought a Sunday
[11:11] school lesson
[11:13] father without that seed without your
[11:15] presence we're not going to go anywhere
[11:17] father
[11:19] but we're thankful Lord that you spoke
[11:20] that word in the beginning and you keep
[11:23] it still today
[11:24] bless you people bless the tithes and
[11:26] offerings Lord we lift you up
[11:29] worship you in spirit and in truth
[11:32] remember those that had burdens upon
[11:34] their hearts this morning
[11:36] remember our children father how we
[11:39] think of them often how we want them
[11:41] sitting right next to us in the house of
[11:43] God
[11:43] full of the Holy Ghost sealed until the
[11:46] day of redemption
[11:48] that's a parent's desire father and I'm
[11:51] sure it's your desire we love you this
[11:54] morning we praise you bless those that
[11:57] are streaming father we just pray that
[11:59] you give traveling Mercy to all those
[12:01] that are traveling around out and about
[12:04] for your service in Jesus name we pray
[12:07] amen amen you want to create an
[12:10] atmosphere for the Lord to feel welcome
[12:12] amen how many want to create an
[12:13] happiness first say Lord I want you to
[12:15] feel welcome amen we had a quite a time
[12:18] I won't take any time to tell it today
[12:21] but quite a time in in Israel and it was
[12:24] incredible to me to watch the Jews how
[12:28] that they even when they're reading the
[12:30] Bible for the reading Victoria they're
[12:32] they're doing something called chuckling
[12:34] so that you've seen them do this
[12:38] constantly when they're reading when
[12:39] they're praying so I thought why do they
[12:42] do that when you look it up the reason
[12:43] is is because David said with my body
[12:46] not just with my mouth but with my whole
[12:49] body that this they believe that the
[12:52] soul is like a is like a candle and if
[12:55] you ever light a candle it doesn't stay
[12:57] straight it moves the whole time it's an
[13:00] active Dynamic flame and so they believe
[13:03] that worship to God should be an active
[13:05] Dynamic movement where you surrender not
[13:07] just your voice you might not even have
[13:10] a very good voice today but that's all
[13:11] right Make a Joyful Noise to the Lord
[13:13] and it's not a Joyful Noise isn't just
[13:15] what you do with your vocal cords it's
[13:17] what you do with your whole body I just
[13:19] want to raise my hand how many can do it
[13:20] with me say Lord I Surrender my whole
[13:22] vessel to you and they're going to move
[13:24] Beyond this Dimension move into another
[13:26] world and let the angels of God minister
[13:29] to us this morning water you turned into

[29:58] into another atmosphere
[30:00] when I got up this morning
[30:02] wow it's like the heavens were opened
[30:06] and Brother Don wrote to me again and I
[30:09] wrote back to him to say Brother Don

[30:13] his prayer the Lord would even break
[30:14] with even fresh and I I went to bed

[32:10] do is humble ourselves Lord before your
[32:13] presence this morning and we do so and
[32:16] as a prophet would say humble yourself
[32:17] he said I I humbled myself and then I
[32:21] humbled myself again Lord and I I seek
[32:26] to come to this Pulpit humbly but yet I
[32:29] never step onto the platform without I
[32:31] humble myself again Lord and I stand
[32:34] here in the pulpit and read your word I
[32:36] humble myself again father
[32:39] how do I humble myself by realizing how
[32:42] very unworthy I am to stand here and if
[32:46] it were not for you none of us could
[32:49] stand here this morning and receive the
[32:52] things of God if it were not for you
[32:54] Lord if it were not for your vision and
[32:57] your plan and that day on Calvary and
[32:59] what you accomplished Lord if you hadn't
[33:02] have stepped forward from the eternities
[33:03] to claim the book lord none of this
[33:06] would even be possible today we would
[33:08] just simply be uh an extended time
[33:12] version of the former Revival that came
[33:16] in the early part of the 20th century
[33:18] we'd just be Lord uh no doubt a steep
[33:22] degradation of that and uh and um and
[33:24] and twisted away into chaos Lord but you
[33:28] came forward you took the book you
[33:30] opened and loosed the word to us and so
[33:33] today we stand here Lord as though we
[33:36] never sinned in the first place we're
[33:38] standing here the this morning Lord
[33:40] worthy in Christ because of you so Lord
[33:44] now come and take your word break it to
[33:47] us Lord It's the bread of life help me
[33:49] be with my heart and mind Lord I I have
[33:53] trusted that that I know the word Lord
[33:57] must come from a clean vessel and I have
[34:00] laid before you Lord and I have pled
[34:02] your blood over my entire life Lord God
[34:04] May every man and woman boy and girl in
[34:08] this building do the same fresh this
[34:10] morning that they may receive the word
[34:13] of life it must come with into clean
[34:15] hearts and clean minds and people who
[34:18] wish to to be the image of Christ in the
[34:21] earth Lord that's a great desire that we
[34:24] have I pray that you will grant us a
[34:26] fresh filling of your Holy Spirit this
[34:28] morning in Jesus name amen God bless you
[34:32] friends you can be seated
[34:34] that may seem like a bizarre way to pray
[34:37] but the further I go the longer I live
[34:41] the more I preach the more I realize how
[34:45] what God has called us to friends and I
[34:49] can tell you we're not just a church on
[34:52] the corner I never wanted first of all I
[34:54] always told the Lord when I argued
[34:57] against ever being a pastor and if you
[35:00] you might imagine say you argued with
[35:02] the Lord that might seem hard for you to
[35:04] believe but I did for years and and but
[35:08] I've but I would also say but if I ever
[35:11] do if I ever do become that I have no
[35:14] idea what my future holds but if I ever
[35:17] do I knew that I wouldn't want to
[35:20] preside over just another church on the
[35:23] corner I I wanted to be something more
[35:26] Hallelujah is that your desire today
[35:29] amen well I'm I'm here to say
[35:32] congratulations God has given us the
[35:34] more he's given us the wherewithal to
[35:37] not just do more but to be more amen
[35:42] so last time and I'm just going to have
[35:45] to go right into it uh um and we just
[35:48] want to be in prayer for a number of
[35:51] families still traveling I know there's
[35:52] a number over in Georgia who went for
[35:55] the services in the concert there and I
[35:58] was watching some of that last night and
[36:00] so I want to be praying for them brother
[36:02] Steve sister Emily on the road headed
[36:04] this way also and other different ones
[36:07] I'm sure who are out of town today amen
[36:10] who um who aren't here but I'm sure that
[36:12] the Lord is with them as well all right
[36:15] so last time we had concluded and as we
[36:21] came down in our in what we were trying
[36:24] to deliver is we we we ended up at the
[36:28] point where
[36:29] we were explaining to you how that yet
[36:33] you remember that when Eve
[36:36] committed the transgression that she
[36:39] committed that she knew as brother
[36:41] Branham said when she laid her head her
[36:45] poor little Eve as brother Branham
[36:47] called her poor little Eve his
[36:50] sweetheart his his darling and and they
[36:54] were sweethearts and she laid her poor
[36:56] little head over on his shoulder weeping
[36:58] and crying and saying it was all my
[37:01] fault it's all my fault and but but we
[37:04] realized that from the scripture and
[37:07] that's from Brother Branham dramatizing
[37:09] it as as few could do like brother
[37:11] Branham and he but brother Branham goes
[37:15] on to show and explain that that to
[37:18] remember what the Bible teaching was
[37:20] that Eve did that under a deception
[37:23] Eve never thought she was wrong if
[37:26] brother Branham says it over and over
[37:28] and over and over and over she thought
[37:31] she was doing right she thought it was a
[37:35] good thing she brought it to Adam with
[37:37] joy look at what I have discovered look
[37:41] at what is possible of course Adam being
[37:44] a Son of God being the Son of God was
[37:47] not fooled by that he knew immediately
[37:49] that it was a violation of God's word he
[37:53] he and he also knew immediately that she
[37:56] was doomed without remedy he also knew
[37:59] immediately that if she was going to be
[38:01] saved and he was determined she was
[38:04] going to be saved that if it was going
[38:06] to happen he would have to save her and
[38:09] he already knew how it would have to be
[38:11] he knew that he would have to partake of
[38:14] the same transgression with his eyes
[38:17] wide open
[38:18] see because that's what Sin is Sin you
[38:22] know you sin well that's what iniquity
[38:24] is that you actually know it's wrong and
[38:27] you do it anyway but he did it in a
[38:31] portrayal of Christ who also took your
[38:34] and my sin upon himself he who knew no
[38:37] sin the Bible doesn't say he who knew no
[38:40] sin committed sin said he who knew no
[38:43] sin became so he took your sin upon
[38:47] himself oh my thank you sir he took your
[38:51] sin he took our sin and became guilty of
[38:54] our sin just like Adam the the problem
[38:58] was that when Adam as I've said before
[39:00] that when Adam stepped into death to
[39:03] save Eve he got trapped himself he could
[39:07] not bring himself there was there had
[39:10] been as brother Branham said there had
[39:12] been uh from from from the resurrection
[39:15] of Christ the death and Barrel of Jesus
[39:19] that day on Calvary brother Branham said
[39:22] in the Rising Sun there had been many
[39:25] men
[39:26] noble men who had died
[39:30] and many of them had died for a very
[39:33] good cause but there had there had never
[39:37] been someone who could die and raise
[39:42] himself back up again
[39:45] so whereas Adam couldn't bring himself
[39:47] out of Death Christ was able to step
[39:50] into death for you and me and then turn
[39:53] around and pull you out with him
[39:56] and this is the beauty of that day on
[40:00] Calvary this is the beauty of
[40:03] Resurrection morning brother Branham
[40:04] said there had never been a morning like
[40:08] that morning because it answered the
[40:11] question if a man died can he live again
[40:13] it answered the question of what's next
[40:16] and what's beyond and and we find out
[40:19] that that you know the even the even the
[40:21] sacrificial lamb would have to be judged
[40:24] of sin and he would have to be condemned
[40:28] and he would have to be sent to hell
[40:30] that's what David uh shows and that's
[40:33] what happened to Jesus brother Branham
[40:35] said he was he was convicted and God
[40:38] judged him as a sinner and sent him to
[40:41] hell but David also knew under
[40:44] inspiration hell couldn't hold him the
[40:47] grave couldn't hold him he'll not leave
[40:49] my soul in hell and neither will he
[40:51] suffer his holy one to see corruption
[40:53] and so brother Branham said there had
[40:55] never been a morning like that and
[40:58] that's why we have today the answer or
[41:02] sometimes a better way to understand it
[41:04] we have the answer to the devil's
[41:06] challenge brother Branham said we have
[41:08] the answer to his question the question
[41:10] was a challenge that you know several
[41:13] things if a man died could he live again
[41:15] but but but is it the word that Satan
[41:19] was saying is it the word that's the
[41:21] challenge can you prove that it's the
[41:24] word that can overcome everything and
[41:26] that's what Jesus proved so we have
[41:29] today the answer to the devil's
[41:32] challenge yes you can be free yes you
[41:35] can be a child of God yes you can be
[41:38] redeemed nothing can keep you from it
[41:40] there's not enough devils in hell they
[41:42] who believe have become New Creation
[41:46] we have the devil's answer I am the
[41:49] devil's answer to the challenge
[41:53] as are you
[41:55] oh we are to rejoice in that this
[41:57] morning you are the answer to his
[42:00] challenge don't let him push you around
[42:02] don't let him threaten you don't let him
[42:04] threaten you with your children or your
[42:06] family you have the answer
[42:09] Hallelujah you have an insurmountable
[42:12] weapon an Unstoppable weapon
[42:16] Hallelujah
[42:17] and so we find that
[42:21] that when Eve came remember as we were
[42:25] saying last time so so you know brother
[42:29] Branham says over and over that she
[42:32] thought she was right
[42:35] so when the serpent now follow me real
[42:38] close I'm just building Foundation right
[42:40] now you good
[42:42] so when the serpent brought her this
[42:46] knowledge
[42:48] she was none the wiser
[42:51] she still didn't know
[42:53] she didn't know she was naked she hadn't
[42:55] she didn't know anything what he did
[42:57] didn't break the world because she
[42:58] couldn't break it
[42:59] see
[43:01] so she was none the wiser she still
[43:03] didn't realize
[43:05] what had happened
[43:07] she's still thinking it's a good thing
[43:09] and without any hesitation she brings it
[43:12] right to her husband and tells her see
[43:15] so she's living under a great deception
[43:19] but when Adam catch it now
[43:22] when Adam brought the same knowledge to
[43:26] her she understood at that moment that
[43:30] she was now in a fallen and sinful
[43:34] condition I'm here to tell you friends
[43:36] and that's where we ended last time it
[43:38] took the second Adam if if that took the
[43:40] first Adam to show the first Eve it took
[43:43] the second Adam to move upon you and me
[43:46] and show us I'm wrong I'm undone I'm in
[43:50] sin Hallelujah
[43:52] there is no way for us to know it a man
[43:55] can't know it that's that's that's
[43:57] exactly where the new birth begins is to
[44:00] say I'm wrong
[44:02] I'm lost
[44:04] you can't get a man I remember brother
[44:06] Glenn Miller former Pastor from back in
[44:08] the day
[44:10] made a statement my young heart held on
[44:12] to that I never forgot it he said you
[44:14] cannot convince a man to re to to be
[44:18] saved unless you can first show him he's
[44:19] lost
[44:21] you can't get him to repent unless you
[44:23] can show him he's wrong
[44:24] see
[44:26] and so it takes the Holy Spirit it took
[44:28] the second Adam to move upon us to show
[44:31] us that we were undone and when it did
[44:35] it produced It produced Now Catch what
[44:39] happened that when Adam
[44:42] brought that same knowledge to her It
[44:45] produced for the first time the tree of
[44:49] knowledge and the Tree of Life standing
[44:53] side by side in the earth now both of
[44:56] them are in flesh in a form
[44:59] the serpent isn't Lucifer
[45:02] he's the vicarious way Satan sowed
[45:05] unbelief into God's family and and
[45:08] therefore that's why even children of
[45:11] God
[45:12] are born in sin because we come through
[45:15] the wrong way we come through a
[45:18] violation of the word into life
[45:21] so even though we have a gene of God we
[45:23] still have to be born again you see
[45:27] and so we realized that that It produced
[45:30] it once again that's a very sharp
[45:32] distinction because the tree of life and
[45:35] when I say the tree of life I'm meaning
[45:37] it in the sense of now you've got a uh a
[45:41] Christ seed line
[45:45] see
[45:46] enable
[45:47] and you've got a seed line of the
[45:50] serpent seed
[45:52] and they're standing Cain and Abel side
[45:55] by side
[45:56] so you get me I don't want to lose you
[45:57] in the in the and you get lost in the
[46:00] wording
[46:01] so it's a sharp distinction because it
[46:04] brother Branham had showed that it would
[46:06] have to come forth in flesh see because
[46:08] when the Tree of Life brother and shows
[46:10] us in the tree in in the Garden of Eden
[46:12] that the Tree of Life hadn't become it
[46:15] couldn't be directly partaken of because
[46:17] it hadn't become flesh yet
[46:19] see but now you've got actually the the
[46:23] tree of knowledge standing and It
[46:26] produced a human and the seed line
[46:29] through Adam
[46:31] now you've got Abel
[46:33] and they're twins same mom two different
[46:37] dads
[46:38] that's why the Bible says Eve is the
[46:40] mother of all living but it never says
[46:42] Adam is the father of all living because
[46:44] it can't say that
[46:46] all right I'm trying to go slow so I
[46:48] don't lose you in the shuffle
[46:50] so so it would and you have to
[46:53] understand that it would this was going
[46:56] to be necessary he he had the Tree of
[46:59] Life hadn't become flesh yet it would it
[47:02] would have it would have come forth you
[47:04] know in flesh in fact is that's why
[47:07] brother Branham said eve ran ahead of
[47:09] the Lord
[47:10] that she would have finally become a
[47:13] mother she would and Christ would have
[47:16] been the child she would have had
[47:18] you understand so it would have come
[47:20] forth in flesh to do what to build the
[47:24] perfect image of what the coming Kingdom
[47:27] would be
[47:29] does that make sense
[47:31] because it's just starting out it's just
[47:32] two people in a garden in the whole
[47:34] earth but God's got a vision of an
[47:37] entire economy an entire Kingdom of
[47:40] saint that will
[47:42] fulfill the universe
[47:44] you see so so he's he's got in mind what
[47:48] they're going to look like say well he
[47:49] had it in Adam why didn't he just leave
[47:52] it like he had it because Adam because
[47:55] if he left it like that with no fall
[47:59] then the Redeemer part that was in God
[48:02] could never be fulfilled he would never
[48:05] get to redeem anyone he would never get
[48:08] to heal anyone he would never get to
[48:10] justify anyone
[48:12] but it was in his heart to not have a
[48:15] kingdom of Androids or robots or just
[48:18] people who are born he wanted people in
[48:20] His image to choose him
[48:23] clean any romance I you know I wanted my
[48:25] wife to choose me
[48:28] to choose me against all the other
[48:31] billions of men in the earth when I open
[48:34] a ring box I I'm asking her will you
[48:36] choose me
[48:40] see I've chosen you will you choose me
[48:43] that's what a proposal is
[48:47] no wonder it should be till death do us
[48:49] part
[48:50] that's God's image
[48:53] so so it would it would come forth see
[48:57] it would have come forth Christ would
[48:59] have come forth to build the perfect
[49:01] image of what the kingdom of God would
[49:03] be but it had to be a redeemed family
[49:11] I think you're with me I can feel it
[49:14] so
[49:15] it had to go through remember we're
[49:18] preaching on rebuilding Eden
[49:22] so it had to go through a fall
[49:26] and be redeemed to satisfy that part of
[49:30] God that had called for a redeemer I
[49:35] can't get sidetracked on it today but
[49:37] that that's that same anointing
[49:41] what's is what fell on a prophet during
[49:44] the time of the opening of the seals
[49:46] when he's calling for a redeemer a
[49:49] worthy one to take the book and it's got
[49:51] to skip it because if I if I go there
[49:53] we'll get lost
[49:55] so now we've got Adam and Eve now you've
[49:59] got Cain and Abel now you've got the
[50:03] tree of knowledge and flesh and the Tree
[50:05] of Life in flesh
[50:07] going forward and you can see the
[50:10] difference in their natures
[50:12] you can see that one
[50:15] they're both sincere
[50:19] they both go to church
[50:23] they both bring their offerings and and
[50:26] and Cain is not bringing a facetious
[50:29] offering he's not faking it he's sincere
[50:34] he's trying to worship God
[50:37] see
[50:38] so so so but but the difference is is
[50:43] that he when his when his way because
[50:46] you can only come God's provided way
[50:50] I mean if God is the Redeemer why
[50:52] wouldn't you have to come his way
[50:55] good grief why would if he's the
[50:58] Redeemer why do you get to choose if
[51:01] he's the Creator and he's the one who's
[51:03] going to pay the price I would imagine
[51:05] he has the right to choose the way you
[51:07] get redeemed
[51:09] he has the right to choose what
[51:12] offerings are acceptable to him and what
[51:14] offerings are not even if you bring them
[51:16] in sincerity he's just going to tell you
[51:19] that's that's not the offering for what
[51:21] you're after that what Cain actually
[51:23] brought would actually was part of a a
[51:26] sacrificial of grain and things that
[51:29] they would bring grain offerings and
[51:30] different things but that not for
[51:32] Redemption
[51:33] that wasn't the offering for Redemption
[51:35] for Redemption on in Leviticus it had to
[51:38] be blood see you couldn't bring your
[51:41] grain offering for that so so we find
[51:43] that
[51:45] that now he you've got two boys and one
[51:48] of them is resistant and you know both
[51:51] boys I'm gonna say it like this both
[51:53] boys are savable
[51:55] but only one is redeemable
[51:57] because because only the elected are
[52:00] considered in predestination
[52:02] see now both are savable
[52:06] but not but only one of them is
[52:08] redeemable because only one of them is
[52:11] the is the line the seed line of the
[52:13] Tree of Life
[52:14] right
[52:15] so so we find that now now you come fast
[52:20] forward 4 000 years so just fast forward
[52:24] 4 000 years to Resurrection morning
[52:28] and that's exactly why when he finally
[52:32] when when he finally did come forth on
[52:37] Resurrection morning
[52:39] then he now he's in a position to ascend
[52:42] from a Mountaintop and say all power in
[52:46] Heaven and Earth is given unto me
[52:48] this is why Peter could say God hath
[52:52] made that same Jesus whom you crucified
[52:55] he couldn't just he couldn't go to
[52:58] Calvary at 12.
[53:00] he could debate with the doctors of
[53:02] divinity but he wasn't ready for Calvary
[53:05] he couldn't come out of the water at 30
[53:07] and go to Calvary he had to go into the
[53:10] Wilderness and suffer the Temptations
[53:12] the pride of life and the lust of the
[53:14] eye or everything that you would ever
[53:16] have to go through he had to overcome it
[53:18] by the word
[53:20] and then he had to live and he had to go
[53:22] about his life and do always always
[53:24] always that means never not he always
[53:27] did that which pleased the father that
[53:30] was for your sake and my saying
[53:34] see and and then he had to Die the seed
[53:38] had to get they wanted to make him a
[53:40] king he said well I've got to be
[53:42] portrayed and crucified that be far from
[53:45] the Lord get me behind me Satan
[53:48] the cup my father has given me shall I
[53:51] not drink it are you kidding I came for
[53:54] this cause came out into the Earth
[53:57] that whoever would believe on me would
[53:59] never die
[54:00] and unless unless the corn of wheat die
[54:03] and abideth alone you Brothers as
[54:05] brother Daryl was saying you brothers
[54:06] who are gathered around the campfire
[54:08] with me none of y'all can go where I'm
[54:10] going if I don't die but if I die and go
[54:14] and prepare a place then you can be
[54:16] where I am
[54:20] oh
[54:22] my
[54:25] so that's exact so then so then once you
[54:28] go through that whole process of of life
[54:32] and he's born in a manger in a stable of
[54:37] hay
[54:38] and he's he's not exactly the he's
[54:41] neither the blood of June or Gentile
[54:44] Joseph is not genetically his dad at
[54:49] Mary's not genetically his mom but she
[54:52] does provide the nutrients through the
[54:56] placenta into the fetus to grow his body
[54:59] and so that's why he's a human because
[55:02] he's built his bodies built from the
[55:05] cursed Earth that's why he could age
[55:06] that's why he could get sick that's why
[55:09] he could have a headache that's why he
[55:11] could say oh you'll look at me and say
[55:13] physician heal yourself because he's
[55:14] standing there sick trying to preach
[55:18] you understand that's why he could be
[55:20] killed you can't kill God
[55:23] and once Jesus rose glorified he dieth
[55:26] no more
[55:28] you understand so this is the only phase
[55:31] that God can brother Branham said God
[55:34] acted the part of death in Christ he
[55:37] said he did die he really did die but
[55:39] God couldn't die so God acted out death
[55:43] in a drama through Christ he's doing the
[55:46] same thing through you though you were
[55:48] dead yet shall you live and that same
[55:51] God is living again in his body in the
[55:54] Earth
[55:56] oh my
[55:59] so so this is exactly why 4 000 years
[56:02] later
[56:03] on Resurrection morning
[56:06] when he when he finally did come forth
[56:09] on Resurrection morning now Paul can
[56:13] write to the Hebrews in chapter five so
[56:17] also Christ glorified not himself to be
[56:22] made a high priest but he that said unto
[56:25] him Thou Art my son today at the
[56:30] resurrection I have begotten thee
[56:33] because you've went through the whole
[56:35] process you kept every word you lived it
[56:39] perfectly you gave your life on a tree
[56:41] you were cursed of all men you went down
[56:44] into hell and I resurrected you out of
[56:46] hell and you've lifted up upon the Earth
[56:48] and now today at Resurrection morning I
[56:52] have begotten thee today Thou Art my son
[56:55] today I have begotten thee it's the full
[56:59] cycle of the family coming forth in a
[57:02] body it's Christ Living in the full word
[57:05] [Applause]
[57:07] tea
[57:09] so in Christ
[57:11] so in Christ going down through death
[57:15] burial and Resurrection
[57:18] so Christ
[57:20] on Resurrection morning
[57:22] is now
[57:25] the the elected son of Isaiah 42 and 1.
[57:31] he's now the elected son in a prototype
[57:35] of what the whole family is going to be
[57:40] he was the beginning of the creation
[57:45] of God not just the one born in a manger
[57:49] the Nazarene who walked the shores of
[57:52] Galilee who went about doing good no the
[57:55] the one who went through all of that
[57:57] process who kept every word who
[57:59] sacrificed his life who went to hell who
[58:01] came up out of hell who resurrected in
[58:03] their glorified State now I have
[58:05] begotten thee Thou Art my son and that's
[58:07] exactly why verse 6 he could say thou
[58:10] art a priests Forever After the order of
[58:13] milk
[58:14] because why he's now a prototype of the
[58:17] entire family that's what you're coming
[58:20] to that's what I'm coming to one of
[58:22] these mornings my brother The Trumpet Of
[58:25] God shall sound the dead in Christ shall
[58:27] rise and we which are alive and remain
[58:30] shall be changed in a moment caught up
[58:33] together with them
[58:40] I I can't explain it any clearer I hope
[58:43] you're getting it
[58:45] see so Christ the elected son
[58:48] standing there with the characteristic
[58:51] of God to be a redeemer
[58:55] now fully satisfied
[59:00] forever
[59:01] thou art a priest Forever After the
[59:06] order of Melchizedek
[59:09] you Christ nor your bride will ever have
[59:15] to die
[59:18] because your life is an intercession
[59:20] forever
[59:23] you are you are redeemed my my penalty
[59:27] of my of my own law I suffered myself as
[59:30] well this is what God is saying I
[59:32] suffered In the Flesh for you now we can
[59:35] be together and nobody can bring an
[59:38] accusation against them which are in
[59:41] Christ Jesus
[59:42] understand why you can't be indicted you
[59:45] can't be words you can't be guilty
[59:47] you're free forever
[59:52] oh my
[59:56] two distinct Vines
[59:58] of humanity going forth into the world
[1:00:03] the Christ seed
[1:00:04] the seed of the woman
[1:00:07] and the serpent seed
[1:00:09] as Jesus would call them the children of
[1:00:12] the wicked one
[1:00:14] who Lord who sowed the tares the devil
[1:00:18] what was the field the Earth
[1:00:20] who are the wheat the children of the
[1:00:23] Kingdom who was the sower the son of man
[1:00:26] who sowed the tares the devil
[1:00:30] see
[1:00:31] so two lines
[1:00:34] their two seed lines would fill the
[1:00:36] Earth
[1:00:37] both are a byproduct of sin
[1:00:42] both of them
[1:00:45] these two men
[1:00:47] Cain and Abel
[1:00:48] are both a byproduct of sin
[1:00:51] every child that would be born going
[1:00:54] forward Abel's going to get murdered
[1:00:56] God's going to replace him with Seth and
[1:00:58] from there on he's going to run the line
[1:01:00] all the way out to Noah
[1:01:02] through Enoch through Methuselah and
[1:01:03] Enoch and into Noah
[1:01:06] and then from Noah through Shem
[1:01:09] to Abraham
[1:01:11] right
[1:01:12] amen and then all to on to Moses see
[1:01:15] God's got this whole thing choreographed
[1:01:16] it's beautiful it's like a ballet it's
[1:01:18] just it's so fluid it just is moving the
[1:01:22] devil's running all around trying to do
[1:01:23] everything and Pharaoh this and the
[1:01:25] Babylonians isn't everybody and God's
[1:01:27] just flowing it it's a masterpiece it's
[1:01:29] a piece of art it's a piece of music
[1:01:30] he's just playing it
[1:01:33] the devil's getting played and and and
[1:01:35] he doesn't even realize that God is just
[1:01:37] perfecting his family what is he doing
[1:01:39] he's showing a piece of himself and
[1:01:41] every one of those men so that when
[1:01:42] Jesus stood on the earth he was ever the
[1:01:44] last one of them
[1:01:45] oh my goodness wow
[1:01:49] and so so we find that both of them are
[1:01:52] byproduct of sin both as I said before
[1:01:55] both are savable
[1:01:56] but only one is redeemable
[1:01:59] and and the one that's redeemable is
[1:02:01] redeemable because yes he's a byproduct
[1:02:04] of sin but there's a hidden deposit down
[1:02:08] inside of him
[1:02:10] there's another as brother Branham said
[1:02:12] I found out that I'm not the son of
[1:02:14] Charles and Ella that other one there's
[1:02:16] another William Branham down inside of
[1:02:19] me that wasn't the son the son Charles
[1:02:21] and Ella Brandon the one that was the
[1:02:22] son of Charles and Ella Brandon was a
[1:02:24] sinner who ran from God
[1:02:27] but I found out there was another
[1:02:29] William Branham who was not the son of
[1:02:32] Charles and Ella Branham who was who had
[1:02:34] his lineage in Christ at Calvary and all
[1:02:36] the way back to the Garden of Eden
[1:02:39] that's what your new birth is about it's
[1:02:42] rebuilding Eden he can't rebuild the
[1:02:44] place till he rebuilds you and brother
[1:02:47] Branham said he redeems the Earth like
[1:02:49] he redeems his family
[1:02:53] oh my friends we would have had no clue
[1:02:58] how to Prophet not come in our day we
[1:03:00] would have had no way to know this kind
[1:03:03] of thing and see it put all together and
[1:03:05] find ourselves in the drama and I see my
[1:03:08] name and I have the Same Love
[1:03:11] Hallelujah
[1:03:15] oh my
[1:03:17] so we find that
[1:03:20] that one of them is redeemable though
[1:03:22] he's a byproduct of sin
[1:03:24] he has a hidden deposit he there's
[1:03:27] another Abel who's not not the son of
[1:03:30] Adam and Eve
[1:03:31] see there's another one called Seth
[1:03:35] and Seth is not the son
[1:03:37] exactly he's not only the son of Adam
[1:03:41] and Eve
[1:03:43] Cain couldn't receive it
[1:03:47] he refused to follow it
[1:03:50] he had the choice
[1:03:52] he could have
[1:03:54] God wasn't being facetious when he
[1:03:56] offered it to him
[1:03:57] God wasn't trying to trick him
[1:04:00] that was a legit offer
[1:04:03] you know Cain there's no Gene in you you
[1:04:08] didn't come from Adam you came from the
[1:04:11] Beast
[1:04:12] through a through a breach in the word
[1:04:15] by the by the by the devil talking to
[1:04:18] the serpent to your mother and you came
[1:04:21] wrong however I'm God and I create all
[1:04:25] life and I won't be defeated even for
[1:04:27] you and if you want to live I'll even
[1:04:29] find a way for you you're never going to
[1:04:31] be able to get the Revelation your
[1:04:33] brother because he has a different
[1:04:34] father
[1:04:35] but I'll save you anyway all you have to
[1:04:37] do is emulate him and just live just do
[1:04:40] whatever he tells you go to his church
[1:04:42] close your church
[1:04:44] close the doors and go to Abel's church
[1:04:46] and follow the word that he preaches and
[1:04:48] you'll find yourself at home
[1:04:53] Mercia oh to to the umpteenth degree
[1:04:58] and Abel and a Canaan his anger refused
[1:05:02] hey it came because God wouldn't accept
[1:05:04] his way
[1:05:06] and he was angry with murderous intent
[1:05:09] you see it today
[1:05:11] because we will not Abel wouldn't
[1:05:13] compromise on the word
[1:05:15] if Abel would have compromised then Cain
[1:05:18] could have said hey
[1:05:22] come on
[1:05:25] see
[1:05:26] and and if the world could just get us
[1:05:28] to compromise but we won't compromise
[1:05:31] I have no way I'm compromising
[1:05:34] and the world who thinks that they can
[1:05:36] live a compromised level of a born-again
[1:05:39] Believer but you can see in their life
[1:05:41] it's filled with carnality you see it in
[1:05:43] where they go what they do how they
[1:05:45] dress how they talk how they act you can
[1:05:47] see all and they but everybody wants to
[1:05:49] be a Christian
[1:05:51] everybody wants a version of
[1:05:53] Christianity that will let them live on
[1:05:55] the edge of carnality there's 33 000
[1:05:58] versions of it but the real one don't
[1:06:00] allow that
[1:06:02] the real one does not allow that
[1:06:05] you you'll definitely for sure you mark
[1:06:08] my words on Resurrection morning you
[1:06:10] might have to face me we don't know how
[1:06:12] it'll all come out but I know this much
[1:06:14] you will never go in the Rapture until
[1:06:17] you have fully surrendered to every word
[1:06:19] of God and can say Amen to it a man in
[1:06:22] my home Amen in my life amen and my
[1:06:25] children Amen in every way
[1:06:27] you're going to have to you're going to
[1:06:29] have to do like Abel and say Amen to
[1:06:32] every word or you will be rejected
[1:06:34] doesn't matter that you said in a
[1:06:36] message Church you are born in the
[1:06:37] message had a message Pastor your whole
[1:06:39] life you'll miss the rapture
[1:06:45] we all make mistakes that's different
[1:06:48] it's different than an intentional
[1:06:50] disregard of God's word
[1:06:52] I make mistakes I Stumble and fall and
[1:06:55] have to repent thank God I can thank God
[1:06:58] we have an advocate
[1:07:01] but there's nothing in me to resist his
[1:07:03] word I want all of it
[1:07:06] I don't want any part of me to be like
[1:07:09] the world
[1:07:11] see
[1:07:12] this is what Abel craved Cain couldn't
[1:07:16] receive it Cain refused to follow it he
[1:07:20] wanted his own church version he wanted
[1:07:22] his own worship version he wanted his
[1:07:24] own sacrifice he refused to follow the
[1:07:27] opening of the word but Abel craved it
[1:07:31] Abel Abel like you and I Abel knew there
[1:07:34] there must be something higher than this
[1:07:37] than this life
[1:07:40] there's got to be you know there used to
[1:07:43] be a I hear I hear my parents and they
[1:07:45] they tell about that it's vague they're
[1:07:48] they're not exactly sure kind of like
[1:07:51] there was a garden kinda and they had
[1:07:54] this life and and they you know they
[1:07:57] didn't Abel son I'm sorry you've you've
[1:08:00] skinned your knee that you did that you
[1:08:02] didn't used to happen oh when did that
[1:08:05] oh well we don't know see brother
[1:08:07] Branham said that when they went out
[1:08:09] brother around says that when they God
[1:08:11] drove them out of the garden with an
[1:08:14] angel with a flaming sword now that's
[1:08:16] not a path
[1:08:17] it's not a geographical path
[1:08:20] it's the revelation of the tree of life
[1:08:22] it's a revelation of Christ because if
[1:08:24] they could get to that in a fallen
[1:08:26] condition they'd have eternal life in a
[1:08:27] falling condition and that would break
[1:08:29] the whole plan of God so he's got a
[1:08:31] Jesus was still standing there using the
[1:08:33] same flaming sword when he said except
[1:08:35] you eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[1:08:37] drink his blood you have no life
[1:08:39] he's using the same sword to guard the
[1:08:42] same way
[1:08:43] that they can't understand that's
[1:08:45] terrible how dare you say that and they
[1:08:47] all walked away
[1:08:49] same brother Adam said he did that
[1:08:50] defend the crowd
[1:08:53] and so brother man said that when they
[1:08:55] were sent forth from this a paraphrase I
[1:08:58] don't have the quote in front of me but
[1:08:59] when they were sent forth from the
[1:09:01] garden
[1:09:02] that you know Adam had had the power
[1:09:05] like a like he was an amateur God he
[1:09:08] wasn't like one he was one
[1:09:09] and he could speak to the wind and
[1:09:12] brother Brandon would dramatize it as
[1:09:14] only an authoritative Prophet can and he
[1:09:17] would say he would say oh Adam that wind
[1:09:19] and he would say peace
[1:09:21] still
[1:09:23] thank you darling and Adam you know I
[1:09:26] would love to have a uh something right
[1:09:28] here but that tree's in the way it's
[1:09:30] beautiful can you tree
[1:09:32] uproot where do you want it sweetheart
[1:09:35] how about over here look lovely right
[1:09:37] there move over there
[1:09:39] and the tree I don't know how long it
[1:09:41] would take maybe instantly maybe it
[1:09:43] would pick itself up by its roots and
[1:09:45] walk over and re-dig itself into the
[1:09:47] ground
[1:09:48] I don't know you don't know we'll find
[1:09:50] out
[1:09:50] I'll understand it better by and by
[1:09:53] brother Brian said all the questions you
[1:09:55] ever had are going to be answered over
[1:09:56] there
[1:10:01] see
[1:10:02] and so he had this kind of power but
[1:10:05] brother Brandon shows that when God
[1:10:07] chased him from the garden
[1:10:09] and blocked the Revelation guarded the
[1:10:11] way he said Adam close as I can remember
[1:10:14] the quote Adam lost the Consciousness
[1:10:17] that he had ever had that kind of power
[1:10:21] he had other Avail came down a shroud
[1:10:24] came down over his memory over his
[1:10:27] Consciousness and brother Brandon said
[1:10:28] he law he he lost the Consciousness that
[1:10:32] he had ever had that kind of power or
[1:10:34] that they even ever had that kind of
[1:10:36] Life see so because because the angel
[1:10:39] with a flaming sword was guarding the
[1:10:42] way of their understanding and so it
[1:10:44] became vague it became mysterious
[1:10:48] it turned into a mystery of Christ
[1:10:53] now it's a now it's a mystery the tree
[1:10:56] of life became a sealed mystery
[1:11:00] you see
[1:11:01] but Abel there was something in in Abel
[1:11:06] that he that that that can't be the end
[1:11:08] of it there's something in him that like
[1:11:12] you you couldn't fully explain it and I
[1:11:16] even today being born again of the
[1:11:18] spirit I can tell you what God did to me
[1:11:21] but I can't fully explain it in language
[1:11:23] I just know I'm a new person
[1:11:27] and this is what they belong for there's
[1:11:30] got to be something more he's longing
[1:11:32] for Redemption that's you and me today
[1:11:34] we knew that this Mad World couldn't be
[1:11:39] all that there was there must be
[1:11:41] something more
[1:11:45] as brother lennial says then I heard
[1:11:47] recognizing your day serpent seed and
[1:11:50] perfect Faith the breach and the message
[1:11:53] of Grace and Lord I Thank thee
[1:11:57] Hallelujah
[1:12:01] just as it took the first Adam
[1:12:03] see
[1:12:06] just as it had taken the first Adam
[1:12:10] to make Eve realize her condition it
[1:12:13] took the second Adam
[1:12:15] to move upon us to help us to realize
[1:12:18] that we stood hopeless
[1:12:22] helpless to save ourselves
[1:12:26] it took just listen
[1:12:29] just
[1:12:31] now follow the types
[1:12:33] just as it took the first Adam to break
[1:12:37] the world
[1:12:41] I want that to soak
[1:12:43] I'm going to make two more statements
[1:12:45] you ready
[1:12:46] Satan couldn't do it
[1:12:51] want that to soak
[1:12:53] it it took the first Adam to break the
[1:12:57] Earth
[1:12:58] to collapse nature
[1:13:00] so that when he fell
[1:13:03] brother Brown says everything under him
[1:13:04] fell
[1:13:07] Satan couldn't break the world
[1:13:12] Eve the Bride of Adam
[1:13:16] couldn't break the world
[1:13:20] if you can believe it
[1:13:22] that's actually good news
[1:13:24] because since it took the first Adam to
[1:13:28] break it
[1:13:29] only the second Adam can fix it
[1:13:32] Hallelujah and when the second Adam
[1:13:35] fixes it just like Satan couldn't break
[1:13:38] it when the second Adam fixes it Satan
[1:13:41] can't stop it
[1:13:43] Hallelujah
[1:13:48] to stop the Plan of Redemption this mad
[1:13:52] world can't stop it corrupt politics
[1:13:55] can't stop it
[1:13:57] Hallelujah the Bride of Adam couldn't
[1:14:00] stop it the church can't stop it the
[1:14:03] false Church can't stop it there's not
[1:14:06] enough false churches not enough 33 000
[1:14:09] to stop it just as Eve Adams brag
[1:14:13] couldn't break it your daily failures
[1:14:15] and my daily failures can't stop God
[1:14:20] [Applause]
[1:14:21] you cannot even destroy your own self
[1:14:26] Hallelujah because you are not the son
[1:14:28] of Earthly parents or a daughter of
[1:14:31] Earthly parents there's a Christ see
[1:14:34] down inside
[1:14:38] word amen
[1:14:40] it was marveling
[1:14:42] brother Matt's brother Matt Sunday
[1:14:45] school this morning my goodness
[1:14:48] oh what a thought but the man I want
[1:14:50] that research and wow all the findings
[1:14:53] why that just blew my mind what if we
[1:14:56] didn't have a prophet in this day
[1:14:58] oh you'd have to trust in science and
[1:15:00] they can't even figure their own self
[1:15:02] out
[1:15:03] see
[1:15:05] so just as Eve couldn't break it
[1:15:10] just as just as Eve couldn't
[1:15:13] change it
[1:15:15] you can't change it
[1:15:18] we are speeding
[1:15:20] toward a rapture
[1:15:24] and you can't
[1:15:29] you are going in a rapture
[1:15:32] and there's nothing you can do
[1:15:35] to stop it
[1:15:38] say brother Jason how is that even
[1:15:39] possible
[1:15:41] I'm like David psalm 16. I have set the
[1:15:45] Lord
[1:15:46] always before me
[1:15:49] because he is my right hand not because
[1:15:53] I'm superhuman because he is my right
[1:15:57] hand
[1:15:58] I shall not be moved
[1:16:02] always singing back in the day though
[1:16:05] all hell is sail me I shall not be moved
[1:16:08] Jesus will not fail me I shall not be
[1:16:12] moved
[1:16:13] just like a tree
[1:16:16] planted by the water
[1:16:19] I shall not be moved
[1:16:24] glory to God we ought to rejoice in that
[1:16:28] today
[1:16:30] oh Hallelujah
[1:16:32] that's the second Adam speaking from his
[1:16:34] throne
[1:16:36] it's the second Adam go to you look it
[1:16:38] up when you get home Revelation 21 it's
[1:16:40] the same place he was sitting in Genesis
[1:16:43] when he said let there be
[1:16:45] because before he'd just been a fountain
[1:16:47] an eternity brother Branham just said
[1:16:49] that great eternal spirit there's
[1:16:51] nothing you couldn't even see him he was
[1:16:53] no man hath seen God at any time see in
[1:16:56] that form he's unseeable so he
[1:16:58] condescends himself into a form brother
[1:17:00] REM says that little pillar of fight he
[1:17:02] says fire says I can see it just
[1:17:05] starting to whirl
[1:17:06] think of the atoms and molecules and
[1:17:09] things that had to go on and in physics
[1:17:11] and quantum physics and there's a
[1:17:13] there's a self
[1:17:15] creating
[1:17:17] self-sustaining
[1:17:19] ball of Fire
[1:17:21] and that's God
[1:17:23] and and because now he came from that
[1:17:25] great expanse and he condensed into a
[1:17:29] form now he takes the the title he's
[1:17:32] designated a title the son of God
[1:17:35] because he came from this into that not
[1:17:39] because he this was a separate person
[1:17:41] from this
[1:17:42] this had been this
[1:17:45] until he became this
[1:17:47] and in that form he starts creating
[1:17:51] see
[1:17:52] but but you first you first have God in
[1:17:56] Christ creating all things and now he
[1:18:00] speaks from his throne
[1:18:02] in in Revelation 21 uh and he says
[1:18:06] behold I make all a-l-l all things new
[1:18:19] I have the best possible news for you
[1:18:21] today
[1:18:23] I don't care what where you find
[1:18:26] yourself right now
[1:18:29] you may feel
[1:18:31] like the most unworthy it's only because
[1:18:33] you probably are
[1:18:36] you may feel
[1:18:38] completely there's no way to save
[1:18:40] yourself that's because you are
[1:18:43] but there's something down inside of you
[1:18:46] that doesn't want to stay like that and
[1:18:49] you want more I'm here to tell you I
[1:18:52] don't care what caused you to get there
[1:18:54] how you arrive there where you even are

[1:19:00] want it he said I will make all things

[1:19:41] passion could I dramatize it in a
[1:19:44] greater way you don't have to die
[1:19:48] good news you don't have to die say I've
[1:19:52] got a weakness you don't have to keep it
[1:19:54] I got a problem it can be fixed
[1:19:57] I've got all kinds of baggage he'll take
[1:20:00] it from you
[1:20:02] Hallelujah he'll pour he'll pick you up
[1:20:05] out of the mire he'll sprinkle clean
[1:20:08] water on you and wash you and then he'll
[1:20:11] fill you full of his very life and you
[1:20:14] can be an offspring of the Tree of Life
