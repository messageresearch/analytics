on brother donald amen and then we'll have brother brad who asked me second if he wants to be prepared to come as well [Music] amen [Music] so [Music] all the windows fastened down i spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound half in helpless sorrow and half in fear the day would find the soldiers breaking through to drag us all away well just before the sunrise i heard something at the wall the gate began to rattle and the voice began to calm i hurried to the window and looked down into the street expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet there was no one there but mary so i went down to let her in john stood there beside me she told us who were cheap and she said they've moved him in the night and none of us knows where the stone's been rolled away and now his body isn't there we both ran toward the garden john ran on ahead we found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that mary said but the winding sheets they'd wrapped him in was just an empty shell how and where they'd taken him was more than i could tell well something strange had happened there just what i did not know [Applause] john believed a miracle but i just turned to go circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high cause i'd seen them crucify him and then i saw him die [Music] well sudden back inside the house again the guilt and anguish came everything i promised him just added to my shame when at last it came to choices i denied i knew his name and even if he was alive it wouldn't be the same suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume a light that's shown from everywhere drove shadows from the room jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide and i fell down on my knees and just clung to him and cried [Music] he raised me to my feet as i looked into his eyes love was shining out from him like sunlight from the skies guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release and every fear i'd ever had just melted into peace [Music] he is alive he is alive he is alive and i'm forgiven heaven's gates are open wide he's alive hallelujah he's alive he's alive and i'm forgiven heaven's gates are open wide he's alive he's alive he's alive and i'm forgiven heaven's gates are open wide he's alive he's alive he's alive [Music] glory hallelujah [Applause] you traffic there you go buddy thank you has he risen amen not only has he physically risen but you gotta catch a revelation has you risen in your heart amen that's the desire of my heart amen you turn this mic on for brother john too please [Music] thank you lord i started on this journey many years ago [Music] i've seen a lot of things while traveling to and fro [Music] well i've been through the storm [Music] [Applause] [Music] and sometimes all i try to do it just seems to be in vain you identify with that this morning [Music] but one thing i know for sure gonna get my story ground [Music] cause i've done come this far and i just can't turn around [Music] the things i have to do you may not understand [Music] but my main concern that i'm in the master's plan because i i'm going all the way [Music] well i can care less what the world may do today [Music] cause i've made the lord a promise [Music] [Music] i'd be a fool to turn it loose and let it all go down cause i've made up in my mind that i'm going all the way are you going all the way satan comes around i'm playing with my mind [Music] but i've got a job to do i can't afford to waste my time he pretends to be so kind [Music] get behind me satan i gotta leave going all the way [Applause] that if he would lead the way [Music] [Music] i'm going all the way going all the way i'm going all the way amen so thankful for all the gifts the bride of christ has man we we need to probably change the order of service over and i'm gonna can't hear myself [Music] so we're gonna change the order of the service over and have brother jason come out and if he feels led to have some more specials we'll do that then but we want to get to the most important part of the service which is the word of god let's all stand together [Music] let's sing this song give us clean hands keep g

gone thread of the enemy is vanquished you stand today free completely totally absolutely free god has cleared everything in your life by an abstract search of the book of life and he's cleared your life all the way back to when you were in the mind of god amen long time no see buddy um i've heard of taking a break but don't do that again i'm happy to have brother kenny back today amen not that i haven't seen him but to see him up here amen where he belongs leading singing amen and uh i see that uh you and brother john and brother aaron got the memo today nice easter colors i love it amen praise the lord god bless you we're happy to have brother uh aaron's family here and happy to have them with us amen good to see some of you others here today they you know there's always the the idea of of easter so normally a lot of times you you see people you don't ever see in church but we're happy to see everybody that we're seeing uh i forget who sent it to me some minister and he said on easter that um he finally talked a friend of his into going to church and he actually was a member of that church but he just never went and so he said at the end of the service the pastor was out out shaking hands and greeting everybody that came out the door and he said when my friend got close to him he said the pastor you know pulled him in and said son you need to you need to be in the army of the lord and uh he said i am in the army of the lord and the pastor said well why don't i ever see you in church and he pulled the pastor aside and whispered i'm in the secret service [Laughter] so for all of you secret service agents today god bless you [Laughter] we're happy to have you amen praise the name of the lord wow i i want to just turn right away this morning to romans chapter 7 and i heard the invitation to have some more singing and that's not a bad idea maybe after the preaching that's the time you're supposed to worship anyway really uh the most is after the preaching of the word so brother ken when you come back up if you want to have the backside with a couple of songs that'd be amazing all right now so i sent that to you brother bradley and if you will put that up please i'll go ahead and read from there i have you turned in your bibles to romans 7. but i want to read from a different translation today for good clarity and um you're welcome to read along in your king james version if you'd like but this is really a really nice translation i like how it's worded and it certainly fits the scripture perfectly and everything brother branham taught us i believe friends that that the bible is as taught to us by god's prophet is our absolute amen this word friends this is what heaven and earth will be judged by i'm glad that god sent a messenger in this hour uh who was who who lived an exemplary life and was able to be used of god to unseal and unlock the bible to us it's a book of redemption that we find that john saw there he saw you know a a seven sealed book in the hands of the one who sat on the throne and brother branham gave that seven sealed book a title he called it it's the book of redemption and it's the it's not just a book of names although it includes every name that came from the mind of god but it was the whole plan of redemption so in symbol form we can see that it looked like a a seven sealed book in the hand but remember john is seeing symbolism what that book is is the bible because it the bible is the book of redemption but it was sealed it was locked up and all all the ages could do was probe at it but it was promised in the last day it would be completely unlocked unsealed unveiled and and there's how you find your identification when those names remember it doesn't call names like jason watkins or don gurgle it doesn't call it like that what it sends forth is the mystery of the plan and as you identify in that plan you're identified in the mystery you're part of the word see and that's how you're able to see the word of god for this hour that's why you can't not see it because it's part of you it's why you can't not my favorite double negative you can't not believe it because it's part of you amen so uh i want to read do we have that uh screen up guys uh if you don't it's okay i can just read it aloud uh yeah yeah no worries i'll give you you're holding up is that one second or one minute okay okay all right well the y'all haven't gotten to see me standing in this position for a while so you can gaze at me just a little bit it's me yeah i'm not i'm not half the man i used to be but but it's still me and we're thanking the lord um for the opportunity to continue to serve his majesty the king amen praise the lord all right praise god so romans 7 now i'm taking for a title for my sermon today as you can see here in us as a subtitle to our scripture this i'm about to read you the consequences of calvary okay but now i'm i'm preaching a sermon because i've you remember before i had to take some time off i was preaching on consequences and so i've had this sermon working on it and the lord has added to it daily such as he would uh and it's large i don't know that i'll get it all today but i'd like to but i want to take a furtherance of that consequences series and preach today on consequences under the order of melchizedek now so so why would i take consequences of calvary and then the consequences uh under the order of melchizedek because brother branham in referring to easter easter morning when jesus rose from the grave and he said there never was a day like it see and uh there had been many good men but there had never been a man like this man see and that uh it ended all of the fear you know that that job dealt with if a man dies shall he live again it finally proved it it proved that job's revelation was correct he said i know in the last days i'll see my redeemer he'll live and i'll see and a lot of people who had confidence in job wanted to believe that but now it had come to pass and now there was no doubt the only way you could doubt the resurrection as brother branham says you know just like you doubt the sun is shining he said you'd have to run down in a basement black out all the windows close all the doors cut off all the lights and stay down there in the darkness and just say there is no sun there is no sun there and what a resurrection this is amen sheep brother branham said she's no longer his mouthpiece she became her own mouthpiece and therefore now god will confound her through the prophet and his and the bride isn't that beautiful so what a resurrection this is that we've been made alive out of cold traditions you could still be there friends if it wasn't for the mercy and the grace of god but let's look and see the consequences of calvary and how that it it set us free all right um i'll let you advance it brother brad so let's go to the first slide and i'll just read here along with you brother brad you can just advance as you'll hear me keep reading paul in romans 7 speaking to hebrews are speaking to jews he said you you must surely be aware brethren for i am so he says all right verse 14 again for we know that the law is a spiritual thing that proceeded from god but i am a carnal fallen man sold into slavery with sin as my master i don't understand myself at all for i continually fail to accomplish what i truly of our lord jesus christ because i was chosen to not just be redeemed but i was chosen to be redeemed to be conformed to the image of god's son that's what the holy ghost is given for see but we have to constantly bring our body in subjection to the holy spirit and and if you let if you that's why the bible says let the mind which is in christ be in you you don't have to do that it's your choice but you have to let it you have to allow it you have to let the word of god dwell in you richly because if you do that the the lord will the lord will slip the lord will reach down on the uh you know on the on the vehicle that is this fallen flesh and he'll slip it out of gear and slip it into neutral and then the inner man will just drive everything but if you're not careful you'll come along and put it back in gear and drive it for a little while and end up carnal end up disgraced don't do that see let like brother richie taught us to say you know people say the lord is my co-pilot richie says if he ain't driving richie ain't riding so so that's that's where we want to be all right let's bow our heads now and go to the lord in prayer we thank you lord for this beautiful to where i'm at and my title consequences under the order of melchizedek all right so just like when we take the aaronic priesthood under aaron okay now that that un operating under that priesthood there were certain consequences based on what you did or didn't do you understand and so i i don't want to get bogged down into dealing with that you're you're you're perfectly aware of that that the law was a very rigid set of rules and regs and specifications that had to be kept uh very meticulously there was it was so uh rigid that there was not even a sacrifice you could offer for intentional sin there was no offering david could offer for what he did with bathsheba there was no offering to offer for that and and the the sentence was just simply death you're going to have to die and uh for what he did to uriah as sin from our lives the best that could happen in the old testament was the innocent blood of an animal but you couldn't even they had to stay in paradise in the lower regions of the earth they couldn't even go into the presence of god until jesus christ resurrected and his blood was still wet on the cross when he brother branham says he grabbed satan around the throat and slammed him on the ground and snatched the keys from him and then stepped over and probably stepped on him stepped over him and went and opened up paradise and led all of those captivity captive he took them captive and took them into the presence of god and also uh he also you know will put every kind of distraction in your life to keep you from realizing it now so what a great resurrection that was but then we realized that when the church and of course they had to as i said in my opening comments the church then had to go off and fall away that seed had to go into the ground because what the church had received was the ministry of the son of man now remember that when we talk about the ministry of the son of man brother branham would refer back to melchizedek who sat with his back to the tent and discerned the thoughts of sarah's heart behind him and in this sermon who is this melchizedek brother branham turns his back to the audience and starts discerning people and in fact is he said now there's a man he said he's behind me i'm looking right at be killed and you couldn't kill god you understand but you could kill the temple that god was living in that temple could get sick that temple aged at 30 he looked 50. you follow me so now this is why the bible could say this is why that he and all wise was tempted in all ways as we are tempted so but yet he never made a transgression see so there's nothing you can experience that he's not qualified to be a high priest for when you say lord i got this problem jesus can say i get it jesus can say i feel you because i lived that i know what that feels like and so there's nothing you could encounter from the cradle to the grave that he wouldn't understand you see and therefore he's the high priest of our confession so so now in that temptable body in that body that could get sick in age and die that could be tempted brother adam said jesus was tempted with women because he's a flesh man you understand he he didn't want to die as a man he said he was young he had his brethren he wanted to live he's praying in the garden if it's possible let it pass but then he says not my will so he had his own will he had a will a human will this is a great mystery of god in christ and so but we find that that he humbled himself on a daily basis and said i do always that which pleases the father he did that by his own decision so so so now not only was he the qualified lamb for your atonement but he also lived the perceptive side of the word and its commands on your behalf because the bible says word on top of word precept upon precept so jesus lived those precepts for you because you're always going to stumble and fluff them up you understand you repent but you still are doing it and so we find that that that because that he was the lamb of god for our atonement to bring to pay the price for adam's sin he also lived the perceptive side of perfection on your behalf so that makes him not just our atonement but it makes him our total satisfaction now only then now paul could say now there is therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ how could there be paul said it wasn't i that died it was christ that died don't blame me don't judge me i didn't die christ died and he rose again on my behalf and he lived his whole life on my behalf and the most incongruous logical unfair unreasonable thing that god could ever do is god traded the perfect innocent for the totally guilty that's the love of god that's how much god wants you to understand today that he traded christ for you that's why brother brennan would say what's more precious the blood of jesus christ or what it purchased i mean what's more what what was more valuable to me my money or this device well i'm holding it aren't i yeah so obviously this was more valuable to me than my money and i gave somebody my money and now i've got the device the blood of jesus christ was very precious to god but what was more precious is what god spent it on he spent the blood on you he spent that blood on me now so we find then that that now and that's why so so when it comes to melchizedek now what's the significance of this and i'm gonna have to connect these dots for you and go slow so when you realize that christ was lit was living again that example of the son of man the word made flesh that's what melchizedek was he wasn't born he was created god built a body and stepped in it it's not the same as jesus jesus was the only begotten of the father so brother branham uses melchizedek as and he says this this is the example that every son and daughter is going to come to you're not going to become jesus christ you're going to become mrs jesus christ understand when brother branham says she is him she's not he's not saying she's literally him what he's saying according to hebrews 13 8 she's the same as him [Music] understand she's the same as him he's him i'm we're we're the bride and and and and therefore it's it's under her prophet the bride under her prophet who's under christ is the final voice to the final age so i'm here to tell you something friends you know we we we have the authority invested in us but christ is still the preeminent one jesus christ is is the preeminent brother branham said any teaching any doctrine that diminishes the supremacy of jesus christ is a false doctrine see so we have one lord one faith one baptism and so we realize that yes the bride comes into a relational relationship where it's so close that the spirit and the bride say come they're speaking in one because why it's been there's been an invisible union what what's what's the invisible part about the world don't see it the world looks at us and says oh it's a cult it's an off scour it's nothing it's uneducated it's illiterate and and and and it's led you know led with false teaching but but we happen to already know that's not true that what we are is simply what god promised he would do he would reproduce himself in a bride who would be a product of this not a product of man-made ideology so when so when when so melchizedek is the model that brother branham would go back to for the minute to show the ministry of the son of man he would go there and he would go to to into saint john's gospel to the woman at the well see and and then he would say look here it is again a man meets a woman and there's segregation there's political strife and and here he's standing in a prayer line says now we're just like back the woman at the well he said i'm just a man it's just a woman and so so now when you look at jesus and nicodemus comes to him in the middle of the night and he says you know we who's we the whole sanhedrin all the teachers we know you're come from god because nobody could do what you're doing we haven't seen that since the man that met melchizedek we haven't seen anyone who could literally not only discern the secrets of the heart because prophets could do that remember elisha told the king of israel what the king of syria was thinking in his bed chamber remember that but but we're not talking about just simply discerning the thoughts of a heart but now discerning the thoughts of a heart and speaking eternal life and granting because now jesus can forgive sins you understand you you eat of him and you'll never die you understand so so nicodemus is saying we haven't seen that because when he came not only did he discern the thoughts of sarah's heart but he confirmed the promise and the next year she had a baby so there couldn't be nobody but god and so what we're saying you jesus is we know that that that that was typing you we know that that that that was a pre-figure of the messiah and you must be because we haven't seen anybody that could do that with all of the above and check all the boxes since that day and so so you realize then that this is why brother branham would say that that ministry of the son of man that's why it would repeat in the end time because the ministry of the son of man wasn't simply just in the seventh church age the ministry of the son of man was in the upper room that's what came on them jesus said a little while and the world won't see me but you'll see me because i'll be with you even in you and when christ come into his church that was the word made flesh and that's the ministry of the son of man you understand and so they not only had the ministry of the son of man but they had the office of a son of man and paul because paul was a prophet but but when the prophet leaves the scene when the office of son of man leaves the scene that doesn't mean the ministry of the son of man left because the ministry was still in the church our prophet went home more than 50 years ago that does not diminish the ministry of the son of man and this bride in fact is as she's grown and matured it's increased and and and it's and it's a recognition of who you are and your place in the kingdom of god is what gives you authority there's nothing to garner authority more more than by receiving the revealed word of the hour so we find then that no wonder not now no wonder brother branham would say on it for easter what a resurrection that was at calvary but what a resurrection this is because now what happened at calvary we've got it again see they had that in the early church as i was saying they they that the the early church took what israel as a nation rejected what it israel been promised say what was the upper room brother jason what was the upper room what was that all about and why did they have to wait 10 days because what that was all about was the jubilee which is 50. and christ had raised and had been among them for 40 days and 40 nights and he was leaving but there was 10 days remaining they couldn't get the holy ghost until the 10th till 10 more days because it had to be 50. and the jubilee say what was the jubilee the jubilee was when he would no longer write his laws on stone but he would write them in their hearts and he would take out their old spirit and he would give them a new spirit and then he said then i'll give you my spirit this is what christ came to do we don't hear no more of melchizedek he showed what he would be when he became a man and when he became a man hallelujah then christ gave he said a little while they won't see me but you'll see me i'll be with you even in you what was transitioning remember they wanted jesus to to go to the let's be make you a king now and jesus said no we can't do that he said i've got to be betrayed in the hands of centered and killed and dries on the third day oh lord well i'll never let that happen and peter meant it i mean he grabs a sword and whacks off the ear of the of the high priest servant i promise you he wasn't aiming for his ear he wasn't aiming for his ear and and so you know jesus has to put your sword away and has reach and recreate a new ear on the man and you know and so so we find that that that what's happening coming into the church was the jubilee which was the abstract which was what adam had lost adam had lost the book of redemption that john sees in the hands of the one on the throne i understand well why is it a seven sealed book on the in the hands of the one on the throne why is it a seven sealed book because when it was released to the church as the jubilee which restored the abstract which gave him the title deed which gave him the holy ghost which made the son of man ministry but then that church backslid after the disciples went away and the apostles all died you understand so now and of course it had to the seed had to go into the ground jesus told them when they wanted to make him king we can't do it that way because if i don't die then i'll just never have a family i'll be alone see and i didn't come here to stay alone that was how i was in the eternities i created all i got i kicked this all off so that i wouldn't be alone and now you're here wanting to interrupt my plan don't interrupt my plan peter get out of the way the cup my father hath given me to drink shall i not drink it are you kidding i've invested all my whole life to drink it and now i'm right at the moment and i'm going to get the big payoff i'm going to finally have my family that i lost that adam lost control of and the devil held it i'm finally going to get him back you understand and so when he died and went down and body slams the devil takes the keys from him opens up the prison doors ascends back up on high scene of many for 40 days and 40 nights ascends into glory sent back his life into the church now the title now the book is opened again now the title deed the abstract the power the authority is back in the church again amen the ministry of the son of man the minute the the the the ministry of melchizedek is among them but that seed had to go into the ground you get me because if it if it if it didn't then only that early church would be and what about me and you yeah you know we were at the back of the line going keep it coming keep it no no no don't stop keep it coming you know and so so it had to go under the ground it had to fall away and when it falls away when they fall away into sin well instead of christ coming to get his bride for a rapture he has to sit back down close the books seal it in seven seals and wait for the seventh age because because this is the mystery of life and he can't let somebody have access to the mystery of life in a fallen condition you can't do it on a hybrid gospel that's why in the book of genesis he had to guard the way to the tree of life he ran them out lest they put forth their hand take of the tree of life in a fallen state and live forever now the whole plan's messed up so god simply seals it up sets back down christ steps back in the eternities to intercede for the ignorance but he promised that in the last day in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery be finished why because now when john saw the heavenly host he he saw he a strong angel standing beside him there's there's the mighty one on the throne there's the sea of glass there's the four and 20 elders there's angelic host there's everybody there but when he when he's weeping because no one can open it amen then somebody who's who was already at the end of the book and saw the whole thing was standing there and knew it's all going to be okay puts a handle and says don't weep john he's got this it's okay don't worry trust me i'm already here in the lord's day i'm already at the completed cycle and i see we make it so don't fear stop crying the lion of the tribe of judah hath prevailed and when john turned to see a lion he saw a lamb and brother branham said john had not noticed the lamb because he had been back in there behind interceding in the eternities he stepped forward out of the eternities friends and he come and took the book and broke the seals and sent it down to his prophet with express instructions tell the people to eat this and when they eat this they'll turn it'll turn them into me because this is my seed hallelujah what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is amen amen what an easter time. so you must come under the order of melchizedek which can only come by the message of the hour because the order of melchizedek is the order of perfect atonement perfect redemption see as i said that seven sealed book with that was a symbol what it was was the bible it was the new testament because it was in the new testament that all the abstract rights were going to be restored everything man was going to have access to god again like adam had man was going to have power and authority his family like adam had but adam lost it all now it's being given back now they're getting their abstract title back now they've got the holy ghost now they've got the jubilee and so when they go off into failure it's sealed up to the end time where it's released again and now a bride and listen friends that early church could not avoid falling away because that seed brother branham said it like that over and over and over he said it had to go in the ground it had to it had to it had to go into the ground but now at the end time you realize there's no more ages the bride leaves the seventh church age and goes in a rapture and therefore god has predestinated this bride is predestinated to not fall you can't fall it's already been fixed in the mind of god and it will happen and it is happening and i know you don't feel worthy i don't feel worthy we have our ups and downs i'm still trapped in this flesh but i got an inner man that loves god i got an inner man what a resurrection this is amen so under this order under this order we are priests and kings over our flesh the world the devil and sin under this order that's why outside of this order of the revealed word you're not a king and priest over that you can't you're not a priest you can't summon redemption for your children because you're outside of the atonement you see when you're a priest you're you have to be authorized and now i can take my token and apply it to my home and claim all of my children why because i've got the authority of a priest because the the the example of melchizedek the word made flesh this minister of the son of man is living in me today i have the token i have the abstract i have the power behind the jubilee we have power to cast out devils and heal the sick and raise the dead preach the gospel and drive back spirits of unbelief you're in a place of liberty today see so under this when i live that way then i'm a king over my flesh not the other way around i'm a king over the devils why brother abraham would always remind us we don't live by the mercies of lucifer stop acting like you do stop letting him tell you that you do you don't live by his mercies he don't run nothing but his mouth he doesn't run my life he makes no decisions about my life all my life is in the hands of god see so but but we realize that our life then is a is to be a constant maturing growing because remember we were redeemed to be conformed to the image of his son all right so i'm really going to have to hurry wow can't believe the time is flying like that so so then for the bible says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh that's why we read romans 7. you're free from it you don't no one can make you be a sinner anymore you actually now have a fighting chance to try to serve god that's real freedom people leave the word claiming they want freedom the word is the only thing that gives you freedom because now it actually makes you able to try to serve god see and you say yeah but i still fail the bride that goes home brother branham says in the church age book right at the end near the church age book that that that as the bride receives this word and it's an identification with her lord see then he says then as the then as the headstone nears and she becomes more and more like him uh then than that then he said that lifts her from the earth and she goes in a rapture he doesn't ever say you reach fleshly perfection he says when you go when you get lifted off the earth you're fighting trying you're trying you've now got a fighting chance you now don't have to worry about your failures you know why because they don't count and someday you're going to just realize just that i am an elected child of god ordained of god to believe this word and failures i may have but there is now therefore no condemnation to me because i am in christ there's no one who can even accuse me i can't be indicted i'm above the law it doesn't apply to me hallelujah see so we find then that you know abraham you know that it's typed in abraham if you see the bible talks about uh ishmael that ishmael was a son of the flesh he was a son of his desire but he also had a son of the promise you understand and so the son of the promise didn't come the way the son of desire came the son of the flesh and so we realized that that that the seed line of christ comes through the child of promise not through this flesh you're not going to score enough points in your flesh to get home the ticket is too expensive and you can't afford it all the good works go to a convent live in a seclusion pray constantly and mumble prayers you the price is too high you can't pay it and the good news is it don't cost you a dime it's already been paid hallelujah so we hear this message to come up this is what john heard come up higher this is the this is the start of the rapture that's what people they get so confused on well but chapter four is the physical rapture of the church but we find and that in a sense that's true because that's the bride goes physically in a rapture at the end of the seventh age that she doesn't go into an eighth age she ends goes at the end of the seventh age but at the same time the rapture's not a one lightning strike event the rapture is a three-phase cycle so yes chapter four begins the rapture of course it's the shout it's the ministry melchizedek it's the son of man it's the scene for the opening of the book it's the time brother i'm called it's a time of setting of judgment it's when it's when the world is making their choice and the bride is making her choice i'll tell you something friends brother jack duff says it so beautifully you'll never hear the the word come up unless you first hear and obey the word to come out of [Music] if you refuse come out of her my people you'll never hear come up the only way you hear come up is you got to hear come out come up and go in hallelujah oh my you know we see this world that we live in and i've seen it coming we've talked about it you know uh but but it's it's hard to get our minds wrapped around the fear that it created in us the apprehension and it that doesn't make us bad people just makes us human that we knew that these things would start coming into the world and you know because every year we go away say oh i i wish things could go back to normal well every year we go further away from normal and it's not going back you understand it can't can't get better it must continue to get worse and worse till jesus comes so so every year it it it it goes further away from normal and it doesn't even matter what the graph shows in the short term like you look at a graph of the stock market it looks like it's going up and down but if you if you back up and take a broader look you can see yeah it's going up and down while it's going up it's still going up and so you're watching a broad trend and so i mean you you you you come up to the first woe and it looks like wow perfect time for the end of the world world war never had happened but yet they solved that problem the angels were stopped see because it would have just went to the first one the second or third one it was wrapped up and he couldn't let that happen because i wasn't even born yet i i still had to come and believe the word see you say how ordained were you to believe the word i stopped a world war how ordained was i to believe it i stopped the world war god said it wouldn't matter if i'd have been the only one he'd have stopped it for me said you can't hold up we got i got a servant where's he at well he ain't here yet but he's on his way well where's he at well his grandfather's here but we'll get to his dad and then he'll get here but anyway you got to stop because we can't leave him oh my and so so we realize that a lot of times in the short term i mean between the first and second well it looked like oh we escaped it we got we got kind of got back to normal you really did and you were just heading more toward the second whoa and when finally world war ii was over they danced and blew horns and trumpets and shot fireworks and danced in the street and and gi's you know kissed nurses remember all the big pictures and v-v-e day and then v-j day and or the other way around but but we find that that and it says oh and and then the the 1950s roll in and there's prosperity and the american dream and it looks like oh wow but you know what all it was was just gradually getting worse still a lot of times you know you could have little respites in between you know ups and downs of your life and it looks like maybe maybe you know okay finally okay they finally got some some antivirus medication for this terrible virus killing all these millions of people and uh well guess what it you know there's five more behind this one it's not getting better and when those five come there's ten more behind that one so i just say let's throw off the fear now let's just throw it off now because it ain't gonna stop i'm just gonna have to trust the lord oh sure i'll do what's prudent i'm happy to do what's prudent i'll i'll take the measures and take the steps and take a shot and do whatever they want i want to be prudent i want to be safe i don't want to risk infecting other people i don't want to have residual effects of a virus but the joe's suffering just from residual effects bar has been gone from him for a long time so i don't even want there's nothing wrong with prudent preparation and caution that's sensible you're you're not sensible to not do that but but the fact of it is operating in prudence and operating in fear two different things i will not be afraid especially me i'm here to tell you something friends i thought i was fine when i wasn't you know you know who was conspiring to take me out me and my on-again off-again relationship with lucifer that's who conspires to do you the most harm it's your on-again-off-again relationship with him you know i had i i had reached i didn't know i had reached a point of no return i had already crossed the line i was perhaps hours or days away from passing away and no way to stop it you understand and so so so so so you know we when i began to look at it this way and i i i didn't know that my natural heart was struggling to live i didn't know that i felt fine i felt a little tired had a little bit of funny indigestion feeling when i walked never imagining my whole life i've been athletic and strong and and even when i would go have ekgs they put me on an ekg and tested my ekg'ed me with 12 leads every four hours i never gave so much blood in all my life every four hours took a couple gallons that not really but took took blood out of me and i don't mind you know nurses are love it because i'm an easy stick they say my veins show and and it was really and i don't ever not afraid of needles but my goodness again you're here again you were just here four hours ago yeah and we'll be here in four hours from now and four hours from then all through the night the next day and you know no enzymes are showing up blood was fine ekg was fine miss wykins you've got the heart of an athlete i've had so many doctors tell me that because my heart is strong ejection fraction is strong but no one knew that the line's leading for the blood supply that the heart was being starved because the arteries leading to it were backed up you understand and so i i i i didn't know my heart was struggling to live i couldn't tell that my natural heart was being starved of of the life-giving resource it needed sometimes we get that way spiritually and you think you're fine when you're not because the holy ghost you live by the holy ghost and the holy ghost feeds on the word the heart lives by the blood and the oxygen if it can't get it the heart dies the holy ghost feeds on the word if he can't get it if all he ever gets is worldly entertainment and he never gets this say how do i give him this read it hear it read hear it preached about talk to the talk to the author of the book turn on a tape come to a church service fellowship a brother or sister [Music] whatsoever things are good and lovely and of a good report think on these things see and so you know i i can tell you friends what i found out is that you know my choice to live a healthy lifestyle was taken from me because i was always conspiring you know with the enemy of my flesh you know and i mean i was just waiting for them to create an iv with nacho cheese doritos in it because i was hooked on that for years and inactivity and eating bad foods and eating things that weren't good for me and hey when i was in my 20s and 30s my young body just handled all that stuff it didn't work what that wasn't it wasn't working anymore once i got older and no one knew that because i had no signs of it and i i hope you're catching the the the spiritual i can tell you friends that if your lifestyle is made up of a lack of good food and proper exercise and you eat bad and consume bad things and smoke cigarettes and drink and take stimulants and live a wild life i can tell you you got heart problems i can tell you go to the doctor now because you've got blockages you need dealt with and and you know just just like the same thing you know unmanaged stress you've probably got blockages you'll find out you say oh i feel fine yeah until go down here sometime to the beach and somebody's out there drowning that's a very close person to you and you try to save out swim out and save them and realize you can't you'll find out what what happens is many fathers have perished trying to save a drowning child because they themselves they didn't realize how unhealthy they were what they could have done in their 20s they can't do now and i'm here to tell you something friends let a spiritual demon come into your house and get a hold of your child and you go try to save it and realize you got problems [Applause] you got a problem in your marriage and you need you need to get a hold of a of the plan of god and puts a token over a devil and you know what you find out you're so spiritually out of shape you you can't even pick up a bible spiritually speaking i'm here to tell you something friends this is what we learn church learn learn by what happened to me and put a spiritual connotation on it see and so so so for me now you know and and now i've got a i've got the doctor saying to me mr watkins we fixed your heart i almost feel like a new lease on life because now i i i literally have trouble have so much energy at times i'm almost going to hurt myself i have to be careful and slow down all this new energy and all this new blood i start walking and the more i walk i want to run oh calm down you you know you're not you're not 18 yet just feel that way and so you know it's it's the healthier i become the healthier i want to be but that that's not really the point you know i mean i mean i i do want to be healthy for my family i realized that i came to death store i realized what a shock and a cataclysmic thing it would have been to you see and what it would have been to my family and you know what it would have been here's a hard word get ready man this is a tough one to swallow selfishness selfishness why was my family at risk of losing me selfishness why do sometimes children and spouses have a hard home to live in spiritually speaking because of selfishness of the leadership i'm gonna tell you it's it's changed my whole mindset i just said lord i said it do you hear weeks ago if you've if you saved my life when me and the devil were conspiring to kill me i'm glad i'm glad i didn't have a say because either way i was wiping me out i'm glad the devil didn't have a say i'm glad that there was only one person who had a say and he overruled me and he overruled the devil and he overruled everybody and said no i got more work for him to do hands off so why should i fear friends i'll be prudent but i'm not going to fear i've already faced death i i know now that my life is in god's hands so what am i gonna do i'm gonna go forward i'm not gonna let some virus i'm not gonna let the next five or the next ten i'm not gonna like calamities or governments or hard times or devils i'm gonna go forward go forward go forward see i've already came to death's door i realized that my life is in his hands alone whether my days from here be few or many why should i fear i'm going to commit my ways to him and rest i'm going to have shalom in my life friends i only want to go forward above all else i'm glad that satan had no say in it the doctors had no say i had no say only he who holds my life in his hands had say see and and and you know what all my bad habits what what can i do about them but go forward amen make changes and go forward you know p people say oh brother jason i've done i've done so much wrong in my life repent there's a novel idea repent but go forward see oh i i've stole well let he who stole steal no more go forward had a hard life repent go forward see so go forward your sins are forgiven go forward there's no condemnation to them which are in christ go forward stop letting the devil hinder your friends your your past is erased go forward hallelujah go forward stop crying about the impossible and go forward our future is bright regardless of what satan's best efforts try to do stop fearing life's struggles stop fearing your failures be unstoppable hallelujah say things are contaminating me throw them down see there are many obstacles but so what i was already gone and now i'm not so there's lots of kind so satan already couldn't make me fear of death because i was never afraid to die in the first place but now i've you know i realize what brother branham was told don't fear to do anything because the never failing presence of jesus christ goes with you always i'm here to tell you something friends i move forward i don't care trial afflictions disappointments so what none of it matters anymore hallelujah god has a purpose in my life and i'm going forward [Music] see oh my i'm so out of time stand stand i can't brother i would love to do it but i'm gonna have to stop if i can get by with it brother branham says in the laodicean church age he says now i said a moment ago oh here's the one i was butchered up trying to quote it to you from memory he says i said a moment ago that the false vine came into full fruition in this age her fruit would mature and ripen he says that's correct now we see that we see the false vines fruit fully grown mature ripened the world can't get enough of it and it's madness and it's poisonous listen friends the the earth isn't going to just keep going on not in not god's done with man running things god's done with satan's eden he's not just going to let it keep going the last only thing that's done is to accomplish his purpose to find that last name in his plan and that's all we're here for doing now we're not even here we we got to stop saying brother branham said now all we got to do is lay in the presence of the sun and ripen that was half century ago i'm pretty sure we're ripened i'm pretty sure we know what he wants done with his word i know we have thus saith the lord amen and we know what he wants done with his word and so we're trying to find that last seed and we have an exodus in front of us but i'm saying it for contrast because i'm preaching on consequences see on consequences he says the evil spirited church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree wherein large files of the are you remember in matthew 13 when jesus gives that parable that a mustard seed is a it's the tiniest little seed and when it gets planted it grows a tree and the fowls of the air lodge in it and we find out from the book of revelation that that was a tree of the antichrist and the ones that are lodging in its branches those fouls are demons understand and it was all from this one little tiny seed see it's consequences the false seed of discrepancy got planted it grew tree and the tree housed the fowls and the fowls have taken over the world all from a little seed so don't don't plant seeds of discrepancy stop doing that because they grow plant this and then this all over they say well i've planted so many weeds now it doesn't matter plant this it'll it'll kill out the weeds and you'll grow a crop a crop of righteousness in your life he says the evil spirited church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree wherein lodge the fowls of the air at her head would be the antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true now watch here's a contrast and all this is true and if this is true then it must also be true that the bride church will mature now i don't have to convince you at all that the antichrist has matured i mean what we see on the streets and in the news is unimaginable it's mature well if you can see that say well i don't see it in me do you see that yes well then it's in you so what i don't see it doesn't matter you see it there yeah i see it then it's in you because they're growing together see her rightness shall be an identification with her lord by means of the word and her head will come to her uh is the is the mystery of godliness don't sing just yet just keep the music playing is the mystery of godliness see which indeed is christ and as the false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up of political force physical force and demons of darkness come against this true vine are they the true vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that jesus did then as she nears her headstone becoming like him wasn't necessary that she had to be an exact perfect human being she's nearing the headstone she's becoming like him through the word jesus will come that the bride and groom may be forever united as one say brother jason i see what the word requires and i'm i'm not there and you know what i say to you i'm not either and i don't have to get there i'm becoming i'm becoming there see i'm pressing toward the mark i am doing that yeah i got ups and downs i got stumbles and fares but i am pressing i am coming i am striving i am straining to reach that prize and nothing is going to deter me from that i might get stumbled along the way but i'll just get back up and i'll dust off and i'll press on oh some of you some of you might be here today or maybe maybe you're maybe even out across the airwaves i get so much feedback from people who are listening online and maybe today you might feel like i don't know for reasons that you don't need to tell us maybe you feel like you're still on the sideline watching it all go by brother jason i'll be honest i'm just sitting on the sidelines life and trials and problems and this and that and the other and ten more things that i won't even name have just set me down on the sideline what would you say to me brother jason two words get up get up but my i don't care about your problems get up oh but if you only knew what happened to me i know what it's done to you well i'm not interested in what happened to you i can see what it's done to you and it didn't have to be that way get up get up say oh i i you know i i just i'm just so comfortable i you know i don't keep laying there we're going home we're going home say oh i'm i'm on the i'm on the soft couch of cardality and worldlyism get up get up off of that couch get up over that sideline go forward what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is forget the past start back from where you are where you are right now just say i'm just going to start back right now that's all that needs to happen jesus multiplies you don't jesus you better be glad because if he only added and subtracted if you spent the last 20 years serving the devil you'd need 20 years to serve the lord just to get even thank god he multiplies by the powers of magnitude oh friends i've seen god take a life full of sin for 20 30 years and turn it around and in three months it's such a different person though nobody even recognizes that person oh i get to live you know what happens friends i want to say this because of who this melchizedek was because that has repeated in the end time day because that that means that now the word is open and i can feed on it and i can believe it do you know what that means that i get to live a different set of consequences than the ones i created because he lives because that ministry is back again in the earth because the book is open i get to live a whole different set of consequences than the ones i created hallelujah i am free today [Applause] oh my brothers my sisters how many want to march to zion and say forget my past forget consequences forget it i'm going to get up i'm going to go forward i'm not going to allow the devil to hinder me anymore i'm entitled because i have believed his word i'm entitled to a whole new set of consequences and the devil says you got to pay for what you did nope but you did it no no i didn't do it the other me did it not the real me paul said i find there's two me's going on here brother branham said there's another william branham living down inside there that actually wasn't the son of charles and elle branham and he did all kinds of things but his life don't count once i'm in christ because when god looks at my record he don't look at that man he looks at christ and christ lived perfect so what that man did doesn't matter i am born again the new me with new consequences and new service to accomplish a new ground to conquer new enemies to defeat i say we press on friends [Music] press on in jesus name [Music] amen brother kenny you want to sing a few worship songs and then we'll have some people come up
