TRANSCRIPT
========================================
do. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we just come before you, Lord, and we ask that your presence would be with us, Lord. That you'd take your word and write it upon our hearts and in our minds. Lord, reveal yourself to us, Lord. We want to we want to see you in every line and in every place through the scriptures. We thank you, Lord. We commit ourselves in this time to you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. If you want to go ahead and bring up the the PowerPoint, you got the PowerPoint, just not in the back. They're working on some issues. So, um, you can be seated. Forgot that I wasn't going to read the scripture just to start. So, that's my that's my usual tradition, but you got a little exercise. Got a squat in. So looking at uh courtship, you know, it's it's a journey to finding the love of our lives. And I think when we when we start to look at courtship, we can get very very serious about it and um severe about it. And of course, as we talked about last time, you know, it's really critical that we in in our lives, in any situation, any decision that we make that's so big like this, that we have the fear of the Lord. You know, that's the beginning of wisdom. Without the fear of the Lord, you're you're lacking even this foundation stone, the start of wisdom. And of course, when we approach finding the love of our life, we want to approach it with wisdom. Amen. And it's a lifelong commitment and it must be centered and surrendered completely to the Lord Jesus Christ. Um and so on the other hand is it can it can come and become something like uh especially for young men this is the formula. I don't ever have to talk to a girl. I can just go to her dad and uh it it it is a relationship of love, right? There is some kind of spark but we understand sparks can come and sparks can go. Really love is a lifelong commitment. Love is marriage is a covenant for life. You know people approach to it and what is the doctrine of marriage and divorce? What is my way out? Well, if you're Christian, you don't look at it that way. Amen. If you're a Christian, you you view marriage fundamentally as something that is a commitment for life. You don't give up. No matter how hard it is, you you don't quit. You're if you're a man, your wife runs away from you. You run with her. You don't you don't quit. You don't give up. You don't say, "I can't make it work." That's that's what the devil and the world speaks. It's a commitment for life. Brother Brandham says, 'Now that you know the teaching, don't never do that again. What in the world does he mean? Does he does he mean for us to make a huge mistake and say, 'Oh, I won't do it again. Well, you already did it. He preached it in 1965. So we should understand the teaching that it that marriage there is there is really uh I don't want to go too deep into this maybe I will later but marriage is a commitment for life. It's a covenant for life. The only real way to qualify for real marriage that we can say without a doubt is if your spouse has has passed away. If you're going another way you're trying to make an excuse here and I'm making an excuse here. Many times me uh men they don't love their wives. They don't treat their wives right and their wife leaves them and say ah he can she can't I can get remarried. She did that because you are such a jerk. And so now you think in the sight of God, you have an excuse for any reason, you can go ahead and get remarried when you were the cause for the pain and the affliction and the struggle and the trial because you refuse to do your God-given duty to be a man and to lead your family and to love your wife the way God calls upon you to love your wife and your family. No, that's that's not a scriptural way out. God intends for marriage to be for life. That is his purpose. It was not so from the beginning and it won't be until the end. That's what the prophet said when when talking about divorce. So if we really have a revelation of the message, I know you could say, "What about this situation? What about this situation? What about this situation?" If you're a young person and you haven't been married yet, take this as God speaking to you right now. There is no such thing as an out. There's no such thing as divorce. Otherwise, you're admitting that you are not an overcomer. You're you failed. I'm going to overcome in everything but this one. Oh, but it's this and this. Everything is an excuse and a mistake and you're a victim. Would you please be quiet? Stop crying. Stop whining and and do your duty before God. Times get hard, times get difficult, you want to quit and you want to give up. But if you have the spirit of God, you something will rise up within you to help you to overcome. What about this situation? And what about that? There's many situations. I understand that. I I can't preach about every situation in here. I am not condemning anyone here. I have no one in mind. But I'm trying to set forth the teaching. Yes. Correctly, especially to young people, but also to old people. So you can counsel young people correctly. There's no such thing as a divorce for a Christian. What about this situation? What about that situation? Stop. We we cannot base the teaching of the word of God upon this situation. We're looking for an exception. You're That's what the devil is trying to do. He's trying to give you an exception. What about this? I know this sister. I know this brother. I do too. Yeah. Amen. I do too. But we want to order our lives God's way. I know that sin comes in the picture, but sin will not have dominion over me. Have that confession, have that belief. God ordains the you for you young people. Not knowing the teaching of the word of God, understanding the the the strictness of this, there's a great joy. There is a great joy of learning to love someone. You say, "It's a spark. It's a It's a It's a this. It's the soulmate. It's all this." That's all well and good. There's some truth to that. Every lie has a little bit of truth to it. And so the modern world obviously through Hollywood, through the birth of Hollywood, and I'll say the opening up of the blowing of the fifth trumpet where hell was released upon the world through World War I. Even I don't want to get sidetracked, but what happened in World War I, if you study the history, it literally makes no sense. The only way you can make sense of it is when a prophet tells you that the first woe, the fifth trumpet is the the releasing of of the demon powers from the bottomless pit. Because none of it makes sense. It's a total departure from what everything that happened in the world prior to that. Hell is opened up. It took away it. It it brought forth women with the vote. It brought forth weak weak men that couldn't lead that allowed feminism and perversion to take place. It opened up insane decisions by kings and prime ministers to go to war for basically no reason. It's it was the demon powers releasing upon the earth. And at the very same time, what comes on the scene? Hollywood. So this is all part of the bottomless pit opening up and those demon powers streaming into the world and hell began to press itself into this dimension. And of course it's affected everything. It's also affected the courtship and marriage process. You know at one point in time we wouldn't really have to teach much about this. Our whole culture would be surrounded by doing it a biblical way. Now we have to teach about it. And many times you you you find out young people have never even heard a teaching on it before. Never understood it from the scripture. And so we got to go back not just assume that everybody knows it but really go into the scripture and show the biblical principles. You know when when the world departs from biblical principles what is the thing that happens is that hell takes its place. And every time Satan does it with a gradual process. It's always a gradual process. It starts out and you go back and you say, "Oh, it wasn't so bad then, but now this is the results of what we have today. We understand of course it is a journey of love. There is romance involved. There is joy involved. It's ne it's never to put that aside or dismiss that. It's fun. It's exciting. It's enjoyable. But that's not the main thing. That's that's the outworking of doing things the way God has designed for you to do. The the but the world has taken those portions of the outworking and turned that into this is everything. This is everything. And when that has happened, what when when the feelings and the emotions and all of that becomes the absolute, what ends up happening is the whole system fails. Mar the marriage covenant fails. Now many young people are aren't even thinking about getting married. They they don't see the value of it. They don't see the importance of it. Of course, we're trying to find the love of our lives. Of course, there's a lot of emotions that go along with it. I don't want to go back to finding finding a wife. Man, those those emotions are those are hard. And even when you find someone, it's up and down and you're just like the your cortisol levels are through the roof. I don't want to go through that. And yet, we we as as a as a married person over 20 years of marriage, you still face trials. You still face difficulties, but you face it together. And and out of those trials and difficulties, there's great joy and there's great peace in sharing a life together. But again, emotion is is the is what follows doing it God's way. It's what follows the covenant. We don't follow emotion. We follow Christ. Amen. When we follow Christ, we know emotion follows. All kinds of ones, bad ones, good ones, in between ones. But we can't be of the world because the world allows emotions to override the leadership of Jesus Christ. And that's where the great danger comes in. We'll we'll we'll go into that more later. I will use this PowerPoint. Judges 14 1-3. So let's let's kind of look at a few love stories in the Bible and how how they happened, how they went to p came to pass. And again, I'm I'm I'm looking at these not so much as this is how you know it has to be an arranged marriage or it has to be this type of arranged marriage, but I'm looking at it for the principles that are there behind that. Different cultures do marriage differently. Yeah. in in in ancient Israel, they did it. It was always an arranged marriage. You know, you see these see these movies and things and they're going back to ancient history and they look at that and they say, "Well, um, we want to just marry for love like the common people." Well, that that's funny. That's really funny. If you think that's how that actually worked for all of history, it's not how it actually worked. It's a new thing. You know, this is a this is a 20th and 21st century idea and ideal. Though there is an aspect to that where those things could did happen from time to time, the the norm was not that and it wasn't how people thought. So looking at Samson and Samson went down to Timnath and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. And he came up and told his father and his mother, and said, I've seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore, get her for me to wife. Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, "Get her for me, for she plea pleaseth me." Well, so of course you see here Samson sees a woman, wants to marry her, goes to her, goes to her mom and dad, make an arrangement, make an arrangement. And Samson is given godly advice, the right scriptural advice. Uh, I think you should marry a believer from from Israel. Nope, I don't care. Go get her for me. And of course, uh, Samson is an exceptional person. Everything about him is exceptionally weird and strange and don't follow in the footsteps of Samson. But nevertheless, we see even even for Samson, he understood there was a process. There was a there was a way to approach this scripturally. Genesis 24 1-4. And Abraham was old and wellstricken in age. And the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell, but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac." So here we have a completely blind arranged marriage. And again, the bi I would I would say from being a student of the scripture, the Bible doesn't advocate for an arranged mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar marriage. Neither does it advocate against an arranged marriage. There's there's message believers today all across the globe that they have arranged marriages and there's process in Africa they have a little bit of different process and that can be different in by country in the Middle East they have a different pro everybody has a a little bit of a different process and that's okay as long as we're not following the direction and order of the world world and violating the scripture completely and So Abraham sends out his servant to find a wife. Abraham's servant wasn't really concerned necessarily about if she could have fun with Isaac. He didn't he didn't watch and look look at all these uh young ladies who has the right personality. He didn't go and say, "Hey, will you take this personality test? I need to find out if you uh align with Isaac." He didn't say, "What's your son sign?" Oh boy, that's not going to be good. You're not going to make a good match there. What did he do? He wanted the will of the Lord and the blessing of the Lord. Right? That's that is first and foremost young men, young ladies, you shouldn't be looking out and searching out for a husband. Right? We we'll talk more about that scripturally. Young ladies are given in marriage. Young men fi go out they leave their father and mother and f and go to find a wife. But the center of that is are you finding the will of the lord and the blessing of the lord. Then what was the next step? The next step was that servant went to the family of Rebecca told his testimony. this is the leadership of the Holy Ghost in my life and requested the permission to take Rebecca to Isaac. Then through the testimony they saw this was the will of God and gave her to the servant to bring to Isaac. Of course, this is obviously an arranged marriage. And again, it doesn't have to be done precisely this way. I don't I don't condemn it and I don't uh I don't say it must be done this way. But it's a wonderful outline that we have there. And it's important to understand two things. Is it the leadership of God? And then does the father give his daughter to the headship of another? And understanding that's not that's a process. The father giving the headship to another is a process. It's not just we're dating and we're going out and we're doing all this stuff and then at the end you say, "Can I have permission to marry your daughter?" It's it's from the beginning. It's from the start. It's a it's a respect from the start that courtship should take place. All right. So, looking at the past century, we're going to kind of start looking at uh some of the history. We won't have enough time to go through everything here, but this time and then the next time we'll start to look at some of the developments in Western culture. Again, it's important to emphasize Western culture because, you know, I've been to places where they absolutely if they use don't do it the way the Americans do it. They c they absolutely will condemn their children and when they preach they'll say don't do it the way the Americans do it because they feel like that's such a departure and a perversion from from the way that's God God does it. Don't date like those Americans. That's what they say in Egypt. So in the past century, Western culture has taken a completely new experiment. It's been a cultural journey uh starting with chaos is what it is centered but it's centered around how do we deal with these matters of the heart. We've witnessed the gradual formation of a mythology that encourages us to follow our hearts and it insists that true happiness lies in falling in love. But unfortunately, this this path often leads to a cycle of casual dating. I'll date this one, then I'll date that one. I'll date this one and date that one. And the whole point is follow your heart. Instead of as a Christian, we understand we don't follow our heart. We follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost. Amen. It's a huge, you know, any any young people under the sound of my voice or that would hear this. Um, this is not something you don't just run from one girl to one girl to one girl. You, if that's what you're doing, you yourself are a big red flag. And any godly father is going to say, "Stop. What is happening?" And even that even that in itself jumping from girl to girl to girl shows that there's fathers uninvolved with their daughters and with their sons which is a is is horrible in this system of casual dating. You could start anytime. You know, they start when they're little kids, practically pro progressing from a date to kissing and everything else that goes with that and then when the initial uh spark fades onto the next person, repeating the process. But the question is that is that even for a society, is that model sustainable? Unsurprisingly, it's not rooted in in scripture. And also, this cultural experiment has given rise to a 41% divorce rate in the US. And you look at that and understand that many people just aren't getting divorced. They just move in with each other and they consider that the the the commitment shacking up with one another. Of course, among message believers, we don't follow the world's systems. But then the question is, are we just doing like the the churches are? The churches are 10 years behind what the world is doing, right? They're always 10 years. So then then are we as message believers 15 years or 20 years behind what the world is doing? That's not the standard. Amen. We don't we don't follow just if as long as we're more conservative than the world, we're fine. You you you didn't like that one very much. Neither do I. It's not scriptural. It's not the way we should be. We should be prophetic visionaries. This is the e We're living in the eagle age. We're We're living in the age of strong meat. Eagles don't eat milk. I didn't know if you knew that. Eagles are feasting on maybe when they're babies, they feast on a little bit of meat, but they're feasting on meat, right? And so that's the age we're living in. We can't be in the place where we're just a little bit behind what the world the churches are, a little bit behind what the denominations and the world is behind. You know, this this is something different. We have to be see prophetically into the scriptures and deliver ourselves from the world system. We as parents actually are the gatekeepers of this. So both parents and the five-fold ministry are the gatekeepers of biblical courtship because our kids are kids. They're going to grow up in the environment that we create for them. If we create an untethered environment where we're uninvolved and we got our own stuff going and our own entertainment and our own life and our kids are off just doing whatever they want to do, then what ends up happening is they're going to just do it however they want to do. And if we don't create the atmosphere through teaching them, you know, this shouldn't be a mystery and and suddenly you solve it at 15 years old. This should be something that's being laid in from the time that they're little that you're teaching, that you're laying forth, that they're understanding so that when they it comes to the time that they're confronted, we don't have all these little boys trying to go behind father's backs to get a girl's phone number. They would already understand, well, I'm 13. What am I going to do with the girl? I can't I can't get her a home. I can't take care of her. What am I trying to have a relationship for? They should have been taught that. And it's it's um as brother Brandham said, people say it's child delinquency. Said, "Well, maybe it's parent delinquency." Well, he says, "No, that's what they say it is, but I'll say it's pulpit delinquency, and it must be taught. It must be laid in. It must be understood." And and and the five-fold ministry is there to equip the believers for the work of the ministry. We're we're to equip the saints. Amen. We're equip men to lead their homes, to lead their households to so that the children, this isn't a surprise. It isn't a shock. When it comes to a teaching on courtship that oh, the fathers are laying it in, the fathers are teaching that it's not a mystery. Well, praise the Lord. And that's what we want to examine, I guess, next time. because if I go much further, I'll be way way into the vi way way way into this. So, obviously, we understand, brother Brent, as we read last week, finding the love of our lives is the second most important decision we'll make our an entire lives outside of salvation. Love is a wonderful thing, but we have to remember there's a difference between filelio love, aeros love, and agape love. Amen. There's a difference between lust or falling in love with someone in an emotional situation and genuine love which means commitment. When we speak about falling in love, it's not as though we required some kind of uh virus. That's infatuation. Infatuation comes and goes. But it also this infatuation can often lead you to giving your heart to someone prematurely before there's any kind of commitment that takes place. And when you give your heart to someone, you're leaving a little bit of yourself behind. And when there's no commitment, they decide they don't want to be with you anymore. then you will suffer the consequences and the pain of having prematurely committed you yourself to someone that it wasn't the leadership of the Holy Spirit. That's when we say in courtship in relationships number one is it the leadership of God? Amen. When when Abraham sent his servant out the servant wasn't trying to find compatibility for Isaac. He was trying to find the will and the blessing of the Lord. Amen. That was first. And second, he went and said, "We do you give Rabi Rebecca to Isaac? Will you give permission for this daughter to go and be married to another and come under the headship of someone else?" Because ultimately, that's what marriage is. It's it's a daughter being given from the headship of her father unto the headship of another, her her mate for life, her husband for life, and it is a lifelong commitment. And so, how how much do we need the leadership of God above emotion? Again, emotion follows just just like in your Christian walk. You're not saved by emotion. You're not saved because you had had a a funny feeling come across you. You're saved because you believe because God is dealing with you. Because God has changed your life. Right? And then from that change comes all sorts of emotions. Amen. But the emotion isn't the proof. The the leadership of God in your life by the Holy Ghost is the proof. And so, of course, there's there's a lot more to this and that's why this is going to take probably 15 parts to get through it. So, let's stand and pray. Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you for your word. We want to commit ourselves to you. We ask that you would lead us by your spirit. We ask you bless the worship and the preaching of the word that you'd be glorified and lifted up in our midst. We ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
