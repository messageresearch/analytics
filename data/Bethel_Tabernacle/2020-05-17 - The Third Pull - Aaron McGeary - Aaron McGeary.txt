like you love Jesus I standing over your lazy I worship you as long as I am breathing God you are faithful and nobody loves me like you hey man praise the Lord we could say man to that nobody loves us like Jesus and I think God has given us the capacity to understand his love though the love of God has misinterpreted misunderstood a lot of people see things God says and things he does and they they have a lot of labels for it but the Bride of Christ she recognizes the love of God is so beautiful if you could turn in your Bibles to Luke chapter 14 I'm gonna begin reading in verse 16 Luke chapter 14 verses 16 to 24 very grateful to be gathered together with you in the house the Lord and I'm sure some of you if this is your first opportunity back in the house the Lord you might feel just as good as I do maybe not as nervous as I am but as good as I do just to be gathered together with believers of precious like faith and we're definitely trusting in we many men of God have been using wisdom and prudence and great you know humility just to follow the leadership of the Lord during times like this asking for his leadership not just guidance from the Department of Health and not just guidance from governments but guidance from the Holy Spirit and I think even though we may be following certain guidelines or certain parameters and we're using wisdom and the way we do things we are at the end of the day trusting in God because except he watch everything we do we're doing it in vain so we just completely trust in the Lord that he's keeping us protecting us guiding us and I believe you're in the place where God wants you to be today so I think there's a protection in that and that God will be with us and bless us and encourage us I thank brother Jason for the opportunity to be here and the invitation and coming and being able to bring my family we love you all very very much and consider ourselves just to be in real tight-knit fellowship with you and your pastor brother Jason and brother Matthew is a real dear friend of mine and we enjoy I enjoy being a put on hold whenever i'm whenever i call him and and just waiting waiting for him to click back over and I've waited dozens of minutes at times because I'm just driving he's like oh you're still there yep I'm still here and says so you'll always have that on me say I get brother Aaron will wait hours for me on hold but but and I'm not I'll I nod and but we love brother Matthew and his family and really really appreciate the opportunity to get to know brother Jason to Mars as he's moved here and it's a great blessing to have such tremendously gifted ministry and teaching and the different gifts you have in your miss God really loves you and has gifted you all very much with the tremendous ministries you have so I have a greater edge of nervousness on me knowing the the men of God that stand behind this desk and are able to rightly divide the word of truth and then finding out where the Kaji was here on Wednesday I'm like I'm set up for failure because the the greats have been through here already so we appreciate the opportunity to be here Luke chapter 14 and verse 16 it says then said he unto Him a certain man made a great supper in bade many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent begin to make excuse the first sent unto Him I've bought a piece of ground and I must need to go and see it I pray thee have me excused and there's a lot of just in the excuse there's a lot of things that begs the question why did you why did you buy a piece of ground you never saw before and so there's these are things that just it shows that they really weren't interested in the feast and it says and another said I've bought five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused and again there's a weakness in the excuse because it's almost as if this isn't really true this isn't a real-world scenario the invitation didn't really matter to them and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come now that might sound plausible and so that servant came and showed his Lord these things in the master of the house being angry said to servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the main and the halt in the blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said to the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper none of those that were bidden and refused the invitation will taste of my supper we could bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father were so happy to be gathered together today and this a beautiful part of the country Lord and you know and with beautiful people Lord and with a great character even within these four walls and knowing that there's a people that are faithfully taught even just as many as are here this more this morning in this church there's maybe two to three times streaming online right now and Lord we pray that your Holy Spirit would just come and minister to each heart to those who are streaming with their families those who are in different circumstances viewing the service or listening may the Holy Spirit be their portion and may you take this Bread of Life father and impart it to us that it might draws closer to you and do as only you can Father bring it make it alive to them by revelation and make quicken something inside of them to a further deeper walk with you we committed to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen he may be seated my title is many came and few stayed and I could have titled it many came but few stayed but I didn't I didn't even want there to be a negative in that it's just the reality of it it's many came and a few stayed and my I've been pondering just quite a bit lately on the third pull and I know that's a terminology that's very familiar with message believers and if you're if you're not familiar with it and that you've been in the message a long time maybe you're just not reading enough or listening enough but if you knew if you're new to the message that even the terminology third pool might sound a little bit different I've even had some people testify that when they first heard about the seven seals they weren't sure where the RAM was talking about you know an animal or talking about somebody who's a you know a Navy SEAL and there's like what what are the seven seals and so there's some terminology that escaped us some time but I think this terminology is familiar with this third Pole and it is it is connected with brother branham's ministry and you cannot separate it it's something that's so connected with his ministry and I've been pondering it studying it thinking about it from different perspectives and I just want to make a few statements in the beginning maybe just a lay a foundation for what's in my heart to impress or what's been impressed upon my heart I believe it's in 1956 but at the very very beginning of the year January first preaches why are people still tossed about and that's where the even the terminology of the 1st 2nd and 3rd pull is introduced or three pulls are introduced and it stood out to me recently when I was looking at it that it was actually the language of the aims of the Lord that introduces the the 1st 3rd 2nd and 3rd pulls it's not something brother Branham gleaned from it or used himself but it's actually the angel of the Lord it that gives that this meaning or this language to us the angel the Lord gave brother Branham about these pulls in his ministry and there it's mentioned by brother Branham quite often is in the sermon is this the sign of the end serve seven thunders that are going to bring back the headstone and he connects he makes the statement the mystery that would open up that would bring Christ bring a power to the church and he talks about how it's for these people gathered that it'll bring them to a rapture in faith and so he's making a connection with the third pole with the revelation of the seven thunders which would be that and he's ending the year with a lot of questions about the third pole about revelations 10 even about his own ministry and then the third pole comes into greater focus when brother Brandon preaches the seven seals and he starts to connect things a little bit more tightly and bring it into present-day manifestation in question and answers on the seals he says if you can understand it this is that third Pole and and that brings us to we're no longer questioning whether it will be and we're no longer thinking that its future but he's saying what's taking place right now if you can understand it this is that third pull and then he says you should have caught that the other day and so then you start feeling a little bit guilty wow I didn't really catch that the other day so he says if you can understand it this is that third pull you should have caught that the other day he says you remember and then he gives us some more a characteristics of the third Pole he says they'll be no impersonation like there was of the other two and in that regional original vision that brother Branham had that he expresses and why are people so tossed about how he's fishing and then he's lacing that bootie and the angel Lord says you've tried to explain it and you and you've gave him too much try to explanation to it and he's caused carnal impersonations of even the first pool in the second pool and and brother Branham is telling us that now he's being told that this one you can't fail in this one there'll be no impersonations of it like there were the other two so you cannot impersonate the third pool like you can the first and the second then when he's preaching the Seventh Seal he says this is one thing he cannot in person he's talking about Satan like there was and he says they'll be known mimics to this because he don't know it so if you don't know it you can't impersonate him there's no way for him to know it it's the third pull he just knows nothing about it he doesn't understand it now is he Amen to the head as he come and as he comes to this place in his team preaching on the seventh seal if you're reading it in the table and at least the version that I utilized it worthy and they published this the the editor writes brother Branham originally had the tape stopped here he put in a different ending which he recorded on Monday morning so after he preaches the seventh seal he feels as if he said too much now he feels that way because the third pull is basically connected with the seventh seal and he's been told don't say too much about the third pull you've made this mistake in the past so now when he's preaching the seventh seal after he preaches that he thinks oh my goodness have I gone and done with the first and the third what I did with the first second and he actually goes I believe it was in a hotel room and he records and I may be mistaken about that but he records a different ending to the tape so when they published the tape or released the tape it's a different recording and then what he's actually preached when he preaches the Seventh Seal but this is what he begins to say right after he says that he doesn't understand it he says but there's a secret lays beneath that so there's something on the surface that maybe people can see and there's things that people can describe and maybe there's a language that people could use but it's the secret that lays beneath that so if you're if you're looking at something to say oh oh I see this and I see that you're describing a mountain and you're describing the peak and you're describing everything but then on the inside of that underneath that there's a secret that he can't see that he doesn't know he said there's a secret that lays beneath that glory to God in the highest I can never think the same the rest of my life when I sing and then he stops and I'd had it in in the notes here and I just began to just take things out because I realized I'm trying to get two months of preaching and in one service and and so I took a whole lot out I'll just save it for some other time but even when he's preaching there in question and answers I believe on the seals or maybe the Seventh Seal he said he's wanting to express he goes well it's just but it son well you just live simple why because he's wanting just to say it there's something inside him that wants to express it and tell it he says I could never be the same the rest of my life when I seen he goes I know the next step there but I don't know what how to interpret that it won't be long I've got wrote down here when it happened if you can see here stop go no further than this right here so brother Branham actually has written in his notes top go no further than this right here and he talks about how there's this third part that hasn't been revealed or made known yet he says but I believe it's moving into that cycle and I believe that we would be doing the message of disservice if we just stayed within the context of that language that it's unknown but realized brother Branham felt it was so imminent that it was moving into a particular cycle where that mystery would be revealed but he's constrained because he can't just say now remember that unwritten thing that unknown thing that language we couldn't interpret here the interpretation of it so I could tell you brother man is going to be careful so as to not explain something that is supposed to be a mystery that Satan doesn't know about it's better man even says if Satan God got a hold of this he could cause great damage say well how is that that doesn't make sense Paul even says that had the princes of this world knew what that Jesus was a sacrifice then they wouldn't have crucified him so it's it's not a mystery to us that there could be something that God has to protect because the Satan got ahold of it he could do great damage because he's actually saying had they fully recognized the office of a lamb in his first coming then they would not have crucified the Lord of glory so he says stop go no further than this right here and then he refers specifically to he calls it what time is it sirs and he says do you remember that and it begins to bring back into view the vision that he had of the constellation of angels and then he begins to tell the tenth vision of this very vision that brings into view the the first pull the second pull in the third pull and he talks about how the the first point is even contacting with the flesh you take a hold of their hand there'd be certain vibrations and I've been in joy as a family we're going through the supernatural series and reading it together my wife with the children and and and I'm able to her to take part in it and hear it it's nice just to hear these things told in a way where you can create this picture of what was transpiring but then the second pull he would could discern things in their spirit and experiences that he had but then this third pole was something completely different symbolized in a completely different way wouldn't be a public show all these things that brother Branham says about it and he tells the tenth vision and then he makes this statement and that in that vision where I'll meet you there this will be the third pull and you won't tell it to nobody so he has this thing as Mike don't tell it to anybody whatever you do don't tell it to anybody but he wanted he has to say something because the the third pole it speaks for itself so it does speak it's got to express something but he's very careful not to explain it or over explain it so he says this will be the third pole and you won't tell to nobody brother missus and in Sabina Kenyon he said this is the third pole so we do not use the language that keeps the third pole in some sort of in state where we're not sure what it is and what will come of it but we know that the angel Lord said in 1956 it was this will be the third pool but now when he's preaching the Seventh Seal and these events that have transpired it is now this is the third pool and we should have enough there as brother Branham said if you can understand it this is that third pool you should have caught that the other day we've now have enough - we can say with the surety that the third pool is we contained within the revelation of these seven seals and connected specifically with the seventh seal and we'd say this is the third point so we'll explain it to me diagram it for me tell me all about it you might be able to say well I can't explain it to you I'm not quite sure exactly all that it means but it's connected with that and he says basically the language of it is basically the seventh seal is everything talks about it's a revelation that unfolds like a roman candle he said it's the end of all things so things that unfold into that seventh seal we just don't pin down it well right there March 1963 is the end of the seventh seal no this is the opening of it and things begin to unfold and just cascade forward from there so with those little things maybe kind of scattered out there they might be just puzzle pieces laying around and and you might need to put them together the Holy Spirit do it for you in in those things I realized that I've been under such a pull from your prayers and your expectation and your desire for the Word of God I found myself putting pieces of the puzzle together and wanting to do the whole puzzle today and I was you know I'll just put some pieces together for him and let the let the Holy Spirit come behind it as long as we're still carrying here before the meeting there and I won't try to put together the whole puzzle for the rapture in just one afternoon and there's your clue that I'm gonna go at least another five minutes and get into the afternoon now so to understand we use third Pole third Pole were using this terminology this language out to kind of understand what is meant by third Pole I felt directed to use Luke chapter 14 verses 16 to 24 and so I want to do this very quickly and not read it again necessarily because what's described here gives us insight into what a pull means and now with the things I've mentioned thus far and then also the understanding that you have on the teachings that you've received before think about all the things that brother Bannerman associates with the third pole this is the third pool now think about I want you to think about what a pull is and when he says this is what it is think about what a pool is and this scripture helps us to understand what a what a pull is and in verse 16 as we read in Luke chapter 14 verse 60 says then he said unto him a certain man he said unto him a certain man a great made a great supper and bade many and bade he bade it means he invited or called many so many have been invited many have called to a great supper and brother Branham uses the scripture reading that we read to you in our text and he says this in the message is your life worthy of the gospel this is June 30th 1963 so he has this vocabulary he has this language that the aims of the Lord has given him about first pull second pull this will be the first pull of your ministry and then third pull this is a language that he's familiar with so when he uses this terminology in June of 1963 it gives us he's gonna give us understanding to even what the age of the Lord meant when it used this phrase he says and did you notice Luke reading in Luke chapter 14 there was three pulls or three turns of it so there was three different turns and he calls them pulls he says when they went out first and called to them that were forbidden to come and they didn't do it there's your first turn or your first pull what was the first pull it was actually a bidding it was a means of welcoming or inviting people getting their attention and and it was a way of inviting because there was something you needed to come to there was something significant that was going to be transpiring and happening he says and they didn't do it so their win a healing campaign and went out to get the blind and halt and still there was room so II now it enters into a different phase he says now there's another bidding or another calling another turn and it's in the form of a healing campaign that's to draw people or call people to the wedding supper to this marriage supper and I know that we use the terminology wedding supper referring to a meeting in the air and a future supper but there's also an application um even spiritually to us now and to brother branham's ministry and the feast that he is spreading for the bride just as then there was room so he went out and compelled the good bad and indifferent that they should come in and so program says there there are three pulls in this scripture and I'm using this not to try to get real rigid on first second and third pull of brother branham's ministry but rather the language that he's using to say that there is a draw or there's an invitation or a bidding that the third pull is so the first pull is a an initial welcome an initial invite an initial pull something to get your attention and a sign oh my what what is this I'm attracted to something and then the second pole it has another bidding another drawing even it may be a different way to call people together he says now when he says this is the third pull there's an aspect to that third pull where it's inviting and it's drawing and it's pulling that's what it is it's a third pull its tugging on something so he says this is the third pull he's saying these things that are happening this is the draw this is the attraction this is what this is where God is now inviting he's not necessarily inviting through first please not necessarily inviting through second after the second pull this is now this final in full and complete drawing and attraction and so the first pull let me just I read it in the scripture down because a full of pull is a means of getting attention or drawing people a turn a call a bidding he's saying it's invitation and in verse 23 says in the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and it stood out to me to her now it's not so much bidding you who were invited comments now time because that's the kind of the language of it you remember you were invited now it's time to come and then we'll go find the Hult the people who would really be happy to be sitting at a table go find them but now it's different he goes to the highways and hedges and says and compel them to come that my house may be filled so now it's a compelling it's not just an invitation you who were invited would you now come those who are sick and needy would you now come now it so this this this move that goes throughout highways and hedges and go out everywhere brimmer's the good the bad the indifferent and compel which means to necessitate them got to drive to whether by force or any other means but compel them drum it be a strong drawing power upon him and compel them to come and the reason for this strong drawl this strong compelling he says that my house may be filled and it's because he has a certain number of this just inspires me he has a table set and he knows who's gonna be seated in those seats and so now he's compelling you've got a place at this table now is your time to come because my table will be for I have a number in mind I have a predestinated gathering I have an elect it's gonna sit at this table and feast and now I'm compelling you this is my compelling so that my table will be satisfied it will be completed it will be furnished and then he says for I say verse 24 for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden which had been invited that were asked to come which didn't shall taste of my supper now III want to lay this in and this was going to be maybe the direction that I found myself just opening up to where I realized well there's just no way in the world you can preach that in three hours so I had to I had to tell it turn it kind of scaled it back a little bit and I mean maybe if they're worried and nervous they'll just start pulling harder the harder you pull the faster I preach and the quicker we'll be eating chicken I this is how when he says this that none of these men which were finished out taste of my supper notice this judgment that comes this cutting off that this declaration that just divides now I asked you to come you didn't say now you're condemned this is how the third pull in one census to the eternally lost because they reject the word and once they reject the word it becomes judgment the very thing that was your mercy because he's asking you to come if you refuse that the very same invitation becomes judgment so it's not it's not for lack of mercy it's the lack of a call in the heart of the person to receive it when it's offered because if you reject the pardon if you reject the offer you reject the invitation it becomes judgment and so it cannot be mercy it cannot remain mercy if it's spurned or if it's rejected then it becomes judgment and so rather we can look at this in this sense the first pool even in brother Brennan's ministry attracts many different people and through the hearing the sign and the great campaigns that followed the second pool attracts meaning and now with the momentum of the first pool and now with the second pool not only does it attract many but it also attracts the sceptics it attracts the critics and that's why brother BAM says there was a rebuke in that second pool and and he talks about how that there was a he condemned their organizations and that what's really begin to rile some of them up so there's a rebuke and a correction that comes with that second Pole but the third pool is in part to the eternally lost because it is rejected by those who go into the tribulation and so there's a there's a call that goes out to everyone to highways and hedges and the good the bad then different and there's a compelling that goes on and I'm saying this because installs in prison now brother branham saying could it be that this third pulls to the eternally lost and he identifies him brother breton in jesus's ministry that his third pull was when he went to the souls in hell and preached to the eternal loss those who couldn't be saved now we're brother branham's standing he's going my goodness with what's happened could it be now the third pull is to the eternally lost and it is because there's those that will be here in it he's preaching it preached in christ as the mystery of God revealed preaching all these different things here's your life worthy of the gospel and these different sermons and and there's a not a drawing power there's not people being attracted to that he's getting more criticism criticism just thousands of my friends will leave me when I say this and so he's wondering now what's being manifested what's being preached is it to people who can never come in and he says this though in souls that are in prison now it's the predestinated Church I'm talking to not those out there no sir out of every group he's pulled his predestinated so he said I'm not preaching to the and I preached into the church even though the third pull is to the lost the church and the bride that's not who I'm preaching to what but he's recognizing that his message to the elect has consequences for everyone else because it's no longer in an ecumenical sense we're just you know it just stay where you are remain as you are we just love Jesus isn't he a good God but now he's realized that this has become a razor's edge this has become a difference I'm going to I'm preaching the indictment I'm in dining this generation for the second crucifixion of Lord Jesus Christ could it be now that this generation in this age has been indicted for crucifying the word again could it be that they're all condemned and lost says but my message isn't necessarily to them it's to the predestinated he's pulled his he's pulled he has predestinated so the third poll has a different meaning for the elect the third poll has a a different a different ramification if I could save that for the bride it has a different effect for the bride the effect of the third poem the bride is different than the effect it has on everyone else that the purpose of the third poll the purpose of the compelling the purpose of the drawing is different for the bride than it is everyone else because think about the tone of souls in prison now it's a lot of could it be brother Rams he's looking at things that are happening and I'll say this and this is weren't to me it just oh it just blows up and I want to be very careful just how much I say here cuz it was at this point I realize I've got to leave that aside to stay focused on I'm what the Lord's really burdened me with here when brother Brandon preaches souls in prison now you can see that it has a connection with is this the sign of the in sir because when brother Graham preaches is this the sign of the end sir he brings up all these different things that he's wondering if it could be revelations Qian and a third Pole and the seventh seal and all these different things and he's like this is the end it's over after that we're going to be going home we're out of here and there's an excitement and anticipation about what's going to happen now when he preaches the seals he connects it with us as it's been what I saw and is this the side of the insert' when I was preaching these questions I had about the thunders it's now revealed in the seals we have now preached what this was foreshadowing and telling us to look for this is it then as the days unfold in the weeks unfold in the months unfold he's thinking we're still here so if this is the fulfillment of that which was the end and we're still here could it be fit now what's happening is judgment to those who can never be saved and he saw he's now he's now preaching souls in prison now from the standpoint of not could it be the seven seals could it be the third Pole but now he's preaching from the standpoint since we know it is the seventh seal that's open since we know the mighty angel himself has descended since we know this is the third pull in all these ideas and understands we have in these perceptions we had of what would take place when it happened could it be that now that we're still here and this has in fact happened the lamb has in fact taken the book could it be that this is the consequence so he's preaching more from the standpoint of questions what are the ramifications now what's the fallout from this happening and he and he's connecting it with that is this the sign of the in sir and in my you listen how brother bear agonizes I still have loved ones out there I just have children that needed to come in and the the altar call I remember when I first listened to this sermon when I was in college after I had been begin to serve the Lord and spilt the Holy Ghost I would listen to the message on my way to school and I remember I had to listen to souls in prison now three four or five times before I could come to a peace with it because if you listen to you just listen in to that you'd be troubled you'd be at the altar like they were wailing and crying and screaming oh my god where are we at what's the time we're living in his the door shot is there no more mercy because it was very very very heavy though to tone of what he was preaching could it be the third pulls being preached to the eternally lost and we're sitting here well what does that say about me but listen to what brother Branham says at the end of this this is paragraph 404 I'm souls in prison now what if it's over what if it is over what if the third pole coming up now is to preach to the Lost what if all the types are going to show forth now and then he says and we're in and we're in wouldn't that be wonderful what a fellowship hallelujah see to those who are lost to those who are eternally lost it is a very careful thing but now brother Browns looking at it from a different perspective he says oh my goodness what if this third pulls the two the eternally lost and he goes and we're in we're here we're under it we're hearing it weren't believing he says isn't that wonderful - he says we're in what are we in we're in Christ we're in the open of the word we've seen him fulfilling his word in this last day we caught the revelation we're fellowship and in these mysteries we're in isn't that wonderful praise the Lord right because this third pool has a different meaning to the elect so the bride is drawn by some other force than what draws the church the bride has draw a drawn by some of the force than what draws the world because our drawing power is not natural or national the force that works upon the bride is neither natural nor national the force that works upon the bride is the Spirit of God which is his word that's pushing the bride up and will force her into a new body to a meeting in the air brother Branham said it's national force that put the Jews back in their homeland it's national ecumenical force that puts those churches in the world council of churches the world forces this way the world forces that way but God by His Word is moving us upward and it's the spirit that puts the person in the bride it's the spirit that places the bride of Jesus Christ so the third pull is the power upon the bride to produce in her what God sees in her and I want to say this was just an absolute Nastasia lect you are attracted to the word and distracted by the world when the world seems to draw on you and I say this to the young men the young ladies and and whoever would be listening when you're drawn to things of the world when you're drawn to tick-tock videos when you're drawn to things on the web when you're drawn to sports and you're drawn to all these other things when you're drawn to something you're starting to do the dance moves right now in your head when you and you're drawn to it and you say well I really like it and I find this really really neat and I want to do something fun like that and you feel like it's something that compels you it's something that you're tied to or attracted to I want to say to our young sisters our young brothers and anyone that would be listening to this that's not what you're attracted to that's what you're struck distracted by because you are attracted to the word your attraction is Christ you're only distracted by that yeah it hasn't drawn you but as a distraction but this message is your first and true love your first attraction and I want to say this regardless of the older there are intermediate distractions ultimately the bride will not be distracted from where she is attracted to she will not ultimately be distracted from her mate the revealed word because there's a greater pull upon her than of the first ball which is on the flesh alone there is a greater pull upon her than that of the second pull which is in the spirit realm there is a draw upon her in her soul where there is a connection and an invisible union with Christ in Matthew chapter 22 verses 2 to 14 the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain King we're looking at this as an example of a bidding and a rejection of the bidding and how that there's many that can be invited many that get the attention is is gained initially so as the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain King remember brother BAM says that way he had oh he's there somebody came to lift his hands up her sword came into his hand and he said a sword and the Lord was like no not a sword the Kings sword and he was afraid of it but when he had that that sword in his hand he said the King sword don't be afraid it's the third Pole don't fear it's the vindication of your ministry and so here's a certain King which made him marriage for his son we know that we're living in the the message the revelation of the Son of man is an invisible union of a bride to Christ this the marriage takes place here now and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding so now there's another calling and they would not come come to this union come to this invisible union come gather now for the marriage of my son and their Ben but they don't come and he said forth other servants saying tell them which were bidden behold I've prepared my dinner my auction and my fatlings are killed and all things already come unto the marriage now there is a and it's important for us to realize you don't want to spiritualize everything to where there's never anything literal like there's never a literal change of our body we've spiritually been resurrected we've spiritually been raptured we're spiritually spiritually and we never realized there actually will be a literal translation of the Saints defeating of death there will be a meeting in the air there will be a wedding supper now we only use the language that were given to understand those things but the interpretation will be when he brings it to pass and there has been in type and in one in a spiritual sense a spiritual marriage supper taking place now and brother BAM talks about it from the standpoint that we're eating the hidden manna that the world knows nothing of that the way they eat or the carcass is there will the eagle's be gathered together your feasting not on a man but on the unfailing body word of the Son of Man and he's showing that there is a spiritual feast a bride spiritual feast taking place right now that he's prepared for us in the presence of our enemies so there has to be a fulfillment of us feast it in the end time prior to the change of our bodies where he's prepared a table bring us as a full seven-course meal for all seven skills are revealed and the words ready for those who can receive it so we have a feast right now that we've been called to invited to and I trust you're enjoying it and he says now but they made light of it and went their ways wonders farm windows merchandise you could see the parallel to Luke chapter 14 and the remnant took your servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned their city then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy going in therefore into the highways and his me she shall find bid to the marriage so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good so here's brother Bam's language again as he had read to Luke 14 now it's Matthew chapter 22 in Matthew chapter 20 Luke 14 connected together both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests the wedding the marriage the union was furnished with guests and when the king came to see the guests he saw a man which had not a wedding garment now this is a parable to make the point not to make the point that you could make it to it without a wedding garment but that if you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost you you cannot participate in the feast and it does not imply that there's anybody who's actually in it and there in reality without it he's using the parable to teach the point that you cannot come into this without the baptism of Holy Ghost the dirt dressed in the garments of his word he said unto Him friend how camest thou in thither and not have a wedding garment it says and he was speechless why he has no understanding he doesn't have a language of the message you don't have the language of the token and have a language of the third Pole he doesn't have a revelation so he can't answer he might even be like wedding garment what he referring to he doesn't know these things because he can't know it then said the King to the servants bind him hand and foot and cast him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth what is that representative of tribulation so there is a feast that takes place wherein those were gathered together and then there's a separation between those who are in the Union and drawn and bidden by the word to this invisible Union and those who cannot participate in it and they're cast into tribulation they says for many are called but few are chosen many are called what does that mean many will hear in external invitation many will be stirred up by the moving of the bride even in the first Exodus there's a lot of people that got caught up in the supernatural got caught up in the move and there was millions that were left but only two that entered and there's a lot of people that get caught up in the dynamics of the ministry the dynamics of the church the dynamics of the open of the word but they're hearing the world when they're here they're seeing the fire they're seeing all these earthquakes in these great sounds but they haven't caught the still small voice they haven't responded to the voice and the knock upon the door but they're caught up in something many are called but few are chosen many are caught up in it and moved and motivated many seemingly are at this wedding supper but very very few are chosen very few are elected so how does Matthew chapter 22 actually unfold and so it's a parable which is representative it's symbolic it's not entirely literal till we read it said well there's going to be this happened and that happened there's got to be murders and there's got to be all sorts of things burned up and say well that's that's been fulfilled here this is a parable so it's symbolic to tell a story and we can actually see the very things that Jesus is talking about in this parable we can see it unfold in John chapter 6 because in John chapter 6 we know that Jesus has just prior to John chapter 6 he has multiplied the loaves and fishes and boy was that impressive and so people are like I'll hang out with a guy who can always feed me no matter how much we got he can make five of this and five of that and have bushels leftover after you fed thousands this is a ministry I'm not ashamed of and there's multitudes that would have no problem all you're going to see Jesus of Nazareth Jesus and as it were ever heard that name before he's the guy that took five loaves of bread and five fish multiplied it fed 5,000 had bushels leftover like I'm coming I want to do that I want to participate in that and everybody's looking for a handout right and so in John chapter 6 verse 26 when the multitudes found him and gathered to him jesus answered them and said verily verily I send to you you see you seek me so oh yes they sought him they wanted him they desired him not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled he says you sought me not because you understood the purpose and of the sign you sought me not because you really caught what the drawing power was all along you didn't really got get with it was taking place you only sought me because you did eat of the loaves and were filled they didn't catch the purpose of the draw they didn't catch the purpose of the miracles they were only satisfied with the natural benefit and who wouldn't be satisfied with a physical healing would who wouldn't be satisfied I lost my job I prayed and I got it back who wouldn't be satisfied with all the natural benefits of what the word can bring and but yet he's saying you only wanted me because of the natural benefit and not because of the spiritual draw that was taking place not because you don't seek me because you see i the son of man him in your myths but you like the benefit of being near me real Ram says in the message investments but one day God changed that ministry in him from miracles to the teaching of the word he says surely you could read between the lines you're not that blind I said so blind you can put a pencil in front of your eyes and not be able to see he's saying surely you're not that blind surely the pencil of the word of God isn't going to blind you where you can't understand where we are today my new ministry the present stage of a ministry the very things that we're looking to happen and unfold coming up in the open of the seven seals surely you're not blind that my ministry is going to change from miracles and signs and wonders to the teaching of the word he says notice as soon as God changed his ministry from his miracles his miracles went on but not like that so his emphasis isn't in the miracles but people seek them not because they understand the miracles but because they like the benefit of it so miracles can't continue and people can continue to get the benefit of the miracle but they're not really there for the teaching he says he began to tell them the straight scripture truth and where they were standing the crowd walked away from him and said this is a hard saying what happened the seventy that was following him so now the crowd walks away now it's his disciples that he ordained he says they walked away to said who can understand the thing like this that's all against everything we were ever taught and so the scripture then comes into view John chapter six verse 66 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him many came and a few stayed many came and now here there there there therefore the loaves and the fishes there therefore signs and wonders and miracles but now there's going to be another element unfold there's gonna be a third pull a teaching of the word and over to the word and they're like well just keep doing the first and second this stuff's getting kind of funny wait a minute he's not backing off this he's not changing he's aggravating it we can't stick around for this even if we could get some kind of benefit from it even if it is the best way to live I don't want to have anything to do it this is to sweer this is too different I'm gonna walk away from it because I can't be around and then the very ones who are gained and had a ministry with them it starts getting really really tight for them they start getting really really squeezed they start feeling like oh my this is too much pressure and whether do they leave too and they walked many walked no more with him brother Bev says and go away Jesus November of 63 when the light of Life is shining to bring that seed what could it do upon a rock it will do nothing what can it do upon dead substance it's not sent for dead substance the Sun shines for a seed that's German ties to life in the Bible and His Word in the hour that we live is shining upon those to catch the eternal life those who are predestinated to see it and it won't do one bit of good upon the rest of them there is no life there to come forth by the Sun or by the light then we find out that they turned their backs and walk with him no more so now we see the dynamics of what's taking place in John chapter six it's not so much a personal choice but God's choosing and his forward a nation that there's an intellect there who can be quickened by that pool and there's the rest that can walk in the first and second but they're unable to enter into that place of fellowship of the third pole because they're not ordained to it because when the light of the third pole begins to shine it chases them away but it actually draws the rest you can even use the analogy of a barn light you turn the barn light on in the country and it attracts a lot of bugs and a lot of insects and a lot of creatures created creatures and critters that gather around it but the light's not there for them the light's not there to bring bugs the light's not there to bring critters the lights there to guide a person to a doorway to an entrance so that they can enter safely so it brings up a lot it brings up a lot of attractions a lot of fanaticism and a lot of critics but the light will only have purpose for those who know the way to walk in so he says that they are I try to find my place they turn back their backs and walk nowhere with them now skip live a he give them some sound doctrine his healing days were just about over he didn't care wasn't going to heal too much more think about that there's been this face and he said earlier he still would do it but not like that and he said he wouldn't heal too much more this is the partner I think it's import for us to catch he was going to tell them about something that was better this is brother branham's language something that was better i says he began to tell them that he was there revealed to them who he actually was he come to tell them he there revealed to them who he actually was that's the part that's better when he reveals who he actually is what did Jesus even say to fill up in them because I said I saw you under the tree you believe he says if you believe this you'll see greater things I know it's if you really see what that miracle represents if you really catch with that sign signifies you'll see greater things not just because you believe this was neat this was great this was a wonderful sign but if you really catch the draw in what was there then you'll see greater because there's something greater than the sign there's something even greater hearing better he's saying than the miracles and don't don't get dug don't please whatever you do don't walk away from here so a brother Aaron was preaching against miracles and brother and was preaching and it's amazing how you can quote brother Branham on his right knee trying to position in place prayer line and miracles and altar calls and all those things and he's wanting the bride to come up to a higher faith and you try to use that to bring the bride to a higher level and then your own brothers will turn around and criticize you and say you're preaching against prayer lines you're preaching against healings you're preaching against miracles and you're only saying what brother Branham said and trying to emphasize what he tried to emphasize because what you're teaching is that is God that is God that is his promise it's in his word look at how he's met you there every single time if he'll do it there can you not believe you can take a step higher can we not come into the Gentiles faith of taking him at his word because he's kept his word at the altar he kept his word in the prayer line he kept his word in laying on of hands can we come to a place to say I am a witness I was saved at the altar I was healed in the line I'm taking him at his word to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye God is not going to order did all of a sudden move upon brother Jason tonight we're gonna call a prayer line this is the third pull as I pray for you you'll be changed in your atoms it's gonna be a bride who's walking through each one of these steps of his promises walking through these experience God keeps his word God keeps his word God keeps his word and will one day be able to take him at his word that I don't have to die for that sin he's revealing who he actually was makes himself known see him as he is he says so away they went if it's like they could pay lip service to wanting to Messiah they can pay lip service to Jesus Christ but when he really shows you who he is they don't want him anymore why because he's not 900 foot tall because he's not the big glorious king and the person with the mile long spear that's taken Romans and throwing him all over the place it's not what their minds expected him to be so they went away and the message influenced who says Jesus with great crowds of thousands following now stay with me and this and and are you here are you with me I don't know if I mentioned this before but I was preaching in church and I said is everybody with me and not one person said a thing is everybody followed me and I realize I'm preaching to a pretty sharp crowd nobody could answer for everybody so nobody answered I'm with you but I don't know about these guys so then I said are you with me - Amen everybody so like okay well now we can answer collectively so I asked you individually if you're with me now listen now brother Rams about to make some statements that are very very significant influence 1964 March 15th Jesus with great crowds of thousands following said that's too many he said look something strange here many are called few are chosen so so then he's seen the great congregations he said except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man drink his blood you have no life in you he never explained it now what if he said that in Beaumont today he's down there preaching in Texas preaching in Beaumont Texas what if he would say that in Buford today says no matter how popular he was what do you think the doctors and fine cultured people and scientists would say that man's a vampire that man's a misogynist that man's a racist that man's this that man's that that's what they would say that man's a vampire why he wants you to drink his blood you're going off on a tantrum Jesus never explained it why you don't explain the third Pole he didn't try to water it down well listen I mean I say that but you don't literally need to eat my body and drink blood hey hey you make your own choice you you part you process this yourself you digest this yourself you find out whether or not I could say a hard saying and without you willing to accept it be done to me according to thy word because that's how it's gonna have to be in the bride as it wasn't Mary she had to believe the impossible well be it unto me according to thy word and so he says he never explained it he wanted to shake them parasites off of him right then they all got up and left so what shakes off the parasites the third pull what shakes off the parasites the preaching of the word the teaching of the word the hard sayings then in God identified by his characteristics this is just a few days before the Jesus when he was on earth he had too many with him he looked around and seen the congregation he wanted to get rid of them this is the language brother branham's using about Jesus lady that's too many and now he's saying he had too many he wanted to get rid of him he said except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you have no life in you could you imagine a doctor sitting out there why this man wants to be a human vampire drink his blood nonsense all you people walk away and lead that crazy man alone near that neurotic alone leave this crazy nonsense alone they walked away he never explained it he didn't have to explain it matter of fact he's probably told by the Father don't explain it just say what I said do what I told you to do don't try to explain it because if you do you're going to cause confusion you can't teach Pentecostal baby supernatural things they come up with those supernatural things were then and he says he shakes your faith some time to see what you'll do and he's doing the same thing in this day see let it seem spooky to you a little bit to see where you stand whether you really believe now let's just put this in context I want my show of hands since there's only about half of us here today how many believe that the seven seals are open raise your hand now you can put your hands down I think almost everybody's even my five-year-old Jack believes that now what you believe is that revelation is five has transpired and what you believe is this book of the Bible and these chapters in this Bible that everyone in the world's probed that and thought about and commentaries and all this you believe that happened now you believe that happened because a man named William Branham was caught up in a constellation of seven angels out in Arizona and was given a message and he come back to a little bitty old shack out in Jeffersonville and preached the seven seals to just hundreds of people and preaches from a Sunday with a Sunday and preaches the revelation of the seven seals and when you begin to describe it to people and you want it we believe the seals are open oh my goodness gracious where did that happen tell me about it you begin to describe it you know what you start hitting the since it's a little spooky and he said well you know I I know it was just made 120 that was gathered in the upper room at the climax of Jesus's ministry so I mean it doesn't stumble me that only hundreds would be gathered when the seals are open but it sounds a little spooky when you begin to think about really what we believe he says T's he says it makes us Pookie little bit to see where you stand whether you really believe brother man when he's preaching the seal says you know you'd think that this would be revealed in the Vatican you'd think something like this would be something big something fantastic he says let it seem spooky just to see if you really be remember them disciples forward and by God never moved they couldn't explain it either but they didn't want to move all that congregation walked away thousands walked away why because they didn't believe he says they didn't want the disciples didn't want to move even without explanation they didn't want to move and then and then brother Branham excuse me Jesus says in verse 64 just back it up a little bit but there are some of you that believe not he knew that what he was preaching some didn't believe and because they didn't believe that would shake him away they would fall away for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him who would not see him for what he is in the hour that he was living some speculate it may be Josephus speculates that Judas actually believed that he was the Messiah who'd restored the kingdom to Israel and betrayed him thinking it would force Jesus into his Messiah koffice than if i betray him and he's in bonds and he's gonna be threatened with death then he would show his great power and manifest his great power why because he didn't see him in the expression that he was in and that day as a lamb and as a sacrifice and they can't see him today in his expression he said but there were some of you who believed not all right so he opens the word that pushes crowds away what's supposed to be a pool becomes a push and brother branham says an unveiling of God and what did you he said that's too many he had too many he wanted to get rid of him he won to shake the parasites off so he used strong doctrine he revealed who he was and when he really showed his colors that's what caused people to run away and now brother BAM says this an unveiling of God I hope and trust that you have a had a spiritual understanding of what God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out because I believe it this is Aaron talking now I believe it's connected with the third pole and he's very careful with his language from that moment on it from the time he opens our seals it's a thing sometime we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down he's referring to the crowds mice and now it might bring some to go out some to leave in some de pon da fur but that's done purposely Jesus did it purposely now bream said I have to say things sometimes that I know will thin down the crowd and cause some to leave but it's done purposely it must be done that way then it might be some would say you mean God would purposely do a thing like that he certainly did he does yet actually say things why listen that's why the explanation sometimes can take away the spook the explanation can resolve all the paradoxes the explanation in law if that's really what it is that doesn't sound so bad but God wants it to be raw God wants it to be in the original God doesn't want it with explanation God wants you to see it in there by revelation and accept it with even the stigma associated with it God would purposely say things to shake parasites off yes God would purposely say things to cost thousands to walk away yes Matthew 7 verses 13 14 into yet the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat the broad easy the welcoming the well furnished the one that everybody else is going in could you imagine if you diagram the the exodus two million going that way and two going the opposite way pushing through 2 million people get me the other side get me the other side this is our promise and you'd say um you two seem like you're lost I'll follow the crowd because that's what would seem logical that's why we'd see why how can two people have this figured out well God doesn't want us to rely upon mathematics and online polls and everything else in the and these different things we we look at the revealed Word of God find that channel and we stay in it many will go in thereat because Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it but the RAM says and is this the side of the INSERM a lock I for speaks that he'll be here and we believe that he will we're looking for him we're looking for his manifestation and we'll see the vindicated Word of God there will be just a few understand it as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man what was saved Peter told us in 1st Peter chapter 3 verse 20 wearing few that is eight souls were saved and the language he's using of saved it's not while I accept Jesus Christ in my heart and there's some kind of sustaining of judgment until white throne but it's actually the salvation of that time that age he says in the days of law there was actually three saved what is it referring to the revealing of the Son of Man Luke 17 the wife started out in lost so shall it be in the day in the coming of the Son of Man there will be very few saved translated in that time so the work of God in this hour is not just a salvation that leads us to a grave but the ultimate salvation of the body from death now with that as my foundation I want to bring you to the just the homestretch here and I wish I still lived further west because the home stretch is longer now it's only four hours because I live in Newton and greetings to the churches of Newton but it says is this the sign of the insert now just to kind of tie all these things together in just one other viewpoint here as we want to come to this homestretch brother man brother Branham talks about brother Jackson dreaming a dream and he shares six different dreams and then his vision when he's preaching is this the sign of the insert and he said all these things have happened to bring us to this place where we know this is where we're at right now this is what we ought to expect to be happening and I'm just had I kind of put this together to share it like brother jr. was sharing the drink cuz but I said he said he said said all of us brethren from Georgian from all around standing together listening do you interpret that mysterious riding on those stone that mountain then you picked up something like from the air something like a wrecking bar or crowbar something like that a real sharp this is how he sees it I don't know could it be that that's that sword says how you done it I don't know you struck the top of that mountain ripped it around lifted the cap up off it it was in the shape of a pyramid and you ripped the top of it top of it off beneath that was a white stone granite and you said the Sun the light has never shined on this before look in on this watch this and brother man says this is true from the beginning of time light has never shone on this before and he said look upon this light has never come upon it before and when all of them got up and I told them to watch that and all of them come up to look in so here's this dream by brother jr. Jackson and within it there's something that opens up that brother and says this is what you need to look at and our brother branham reaffirms this in the contest he's preaches the next day after is this the sign of the inserter he says open this year Lord the hidden man of the rock beneath the rock that we might see the promo program of God he says just a moment before that we may say Jesus and his program cap off the pyramids of our life Lord put the cap stone Christ Jesus upon each and every one of us so now he's looking for this dream to be fulfilled then he preaches the Seventh Seal he says now the third came from the West sweeping forward with great terrific speed and they picked me up that was coming back east so now the fulfillment of even the three different movies West and the Angels in the constellation the shape of a pyramid which he identifies it in the in the cloud and he now says that was coming back east with the mystery of these seven seals just like it said in junior Jackson's dream that the Lord let me interpret for him there on the inside of that pyramid there was a white stone that wasn't written on that's the reason I had to go west to connect with these angels message to come back here to reveal it to the church are you following I know this is very very dense well I'm also very dense myself so you just bear with me it takes me longer to get this kind of stuff so now he says he's connecting now we're realizing that what he preaches in this the sign of the insert' is fulfilled in the open of these seals and he brings this vision back up this dream back up and this is what brother jr. was telling us about so he says understanding in the gap and the rock is Christ that was in the brothers dream she's open at the top of the pyramid like rock but however it is a shape of a pyramid but the cap on the pyramid was never put on so now he's talking about the breach between the pyramid body and the capstone and we know in Christ as the mystery got revealed that this is the revelation of the capstone is the vindication that the raptures at hand and there's a revealing of this capstone now uniting with the body he says in the full church it was the headstone so it never did come it was rejected Christ was rejected the headstone in the full church in the Gentile Church ages he says and it will come we find out that during that time I saw seven angels in a form of a pyramid that swept down and picked me up and I brought each to open the seven seals for God that will be the eternal truth of the Living God that was to find out that it was sealed inside this mountain so now he connects it with the stream again there wasn't wrote it had to be interpreted and when I come back the first angel and learn that first night opened the seal contracting anything we ever heard in our life because what happens after the seals are opened the Bible becomes a new book what does he have he says a new message it opened up to us a new land think contracting anything ever heard before in our life open up week it's gone the light's gone further up the road a brand new field this is the language that brother Branham is using now once these dreams and visions and all these questions are satisfied that are brought up it is this the sign of the answer brother says new book new land new message new life new covenant new bride all these things now being made manifest and he says in the third Exodus he's referring to the dream again the seven seals reveal the mysteries and then he opened this thing up at the top and found a rock and they're white but never been wrote on before it was the mystery go to Tucson for tell it before it happened stand north of Tucson witnesses standing there with it when a blast come and then shook the mountains off the ground almost and at the same time a circle of light hanging on in the air when the science took the pictures of it now now I'm not reading that for brother Matthew go to Tucson just to give him a drop with a breadcrumb because then he could say well brother Brad came back eventually but listen to what he's trying to point us to the seven seals reveal the mysteries it's the cap coming off that mountain brother junior Jackson's dreams he's saying he says and then there's brothers present when the blast goes forth that he saw in his own vision and dreams and he thought was the end of him but don't fear it's the vindication of your ministry so now all these things are fulfilled they're not future they're not we're not waiting for them God's interpreting these things by bringing to pass and now he points to the picture in the air a circle of light a cloud high cloud ring of mystery hanging yonder the air and science took the picture of it not us they took the picture he goes in West that's our Lord up there that's God fulfilling his promise word of Revelations 10 1 2 7 and what do you say you see a pyramid you see a constellation a capstone of 7 angels being symbolically represented in the sky and it shows the supreme one the the the the the judge and his wig so now in the Norton ones at the end time I'll say this just to try to sum this up the first pole healing second pole prophesying third pulled the open of the word the mysteries reveal the third pole was brother man's words the third pole was the open of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word and you could study the message on the third pole and you could come up with a lot of questions could it be could it be and I'm looking for this I'm looking for that and I'm wondering about this but once brother Branham comes to the end of 1963 there's a man here who could turn on the light and look away to Jesus he never questions the third pull again we now know what it is and what it does thoroughly vindicated thoroughly identified and he goes I'm sure you understand and we're like I'm sure you caught that yeah absolutely we did Lord let me catch it let me see it but now he knows he never backs up and questions it again every time he speaks about the third pull from that point on he knows exactly what he's talking about doesn't try to explain it he just preaches it the third pole is the open of the seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word and let me say this this is what we must watch that's why he says in that dream look on this because he had a vision of those angels in that pyramid and he says oh it's coming with my message when he saw it he says oh it's coming with my message he says that's my second climax this is what he says I reproach for the word which he preaches the weekend before is this the sign of the answer I know I go fast I know there's a lot here you can always listen on point five speed later but then listen he says that's my second climax there's another climax to the message did you know that if we just ended in 62 then we've got a great climax there's a lot of signs and wonders and miracles and healings a lot of great teaching but all of that was leading to something if it only stopped in 63 it would be partial 62 it would be in part but now he says is this the sign of the answer is this that second climax that I talked about the other day so he's recognizing there's a second climax I'll come to where he describes it here in a moment but brother Branham preaches a power of transformation October 31st 1965 he says this is the climax age this is the age beyond denominations he said this is the end I talked about this is it this is out of Reformation this is the termination of systems this is the termination of denominations they've been indicted now it's the word and the word only this is the climax age this is the eagle age this is the astronaut age climax is the decisive moment the highest point of intensity or development you've reached two clerics means you've reached the highest point this and you cannot go beyond this if you try you start walking down the mountain this is the highest point the second climax he says even know when brother men talked about those Peaks those three peaks and the seven peaks the Branden Peaks he recognized the three pulls in there now Braille Rams used in this second climb matches but there's a climaxes to the ministry to the message when all of it I was laying the background from my first climax when all of a sudden I noticed that was getting late near the noon hour and my congregation begin to get physically hungry here's the Prophet imparting words of life and you know I'm kind of getting hungry here says and they started getting up and walking out with the intention of returning but they must have physical food according to their thinking and some are just getting tired of listening I hope I'm reading that this is just the right time to get your attention I noticed to my right side some young married people were leaving and I screamed out to them don't go for all these wonderful things that I've showed you you don't know where they come from or where you can find them then that was to be my first climax I grabbed my Bible and screamed making the climax they're found in the Bible Crime Commission to preach only the Bible but the congregation walked on I look towards the forest church and none no one was there then I turned and I said that that was the first shake Chicago so he's looking for something to happen real big and shake the whole world in Branson brother Bo hey you shook the church the people that you were called to shake don't look for it to happen some other way he said the church has seen the revelation of Jesus Christ made manifest and they recognized it so this is 62 now November 62 but the church itself has received the shaking they've recognized it they knowed the word they seen the word when it was materialized and they caught it now look at that for a minute because he said there's been some draw there's been some attraction there's people catching it says now and this first message when they seen it everybody rallied for it said all glory to God or if I could see this that on the other and they go right away in the same way they come in and now they think well I don't know where we would you join and if you don't come at this or be this way I'll be kicked out over here and I won't have nothing to do with here she says they've seen it they've seen the manifestation but eventually they turn around and walk away so it's not like they never came they came around for a little bit they were called to it they interacted but ultimately yeah let's just let's just walk out over here she's them brother and sit down and say well what if I do if I they won't stop long enough to recognize it's the Word of God promise being manifested and they walk away but they says but don't worry the shadows are close at hand then he says you remember the other night of the message that he give me back yonder when I was laying the cornerstone just exactly when you come out of this vision read 2nd Timothy 4 and he only quotes this part of 2nd Timothy 4 do the work in evangelist make full proof of your ministry for the time of calm although not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall heap teachers having itching ears turn from truth unto fables so when he reads it reads a little bit out of order there he's recognizing now it wasn't just do the work of an evangelist and make foolproof your ministry but there'd be a fallout and a consequence of it that there'd be those that would walk away he says if that hasn't been just word by word but remember the other night when I never did read the rest of it 30-something years I've preached this Tabernacle never one time did I ever go further than that and I don't know why but now he's directed to the rest of it and he reads from 2nd Timothy 4 refers to verses 10 11 for demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed into Thessalonica Krisha stood Galatia Titus in a Dalmatia and only Luke is with me this is God's mighty man of the hour this is the first church age messenger this is the one that's a light to the Gentiles this is Saul who's now named Paul this is the one that shook off the serpent into the the fire this is the one with dreams and visions and having gone into a third heaven this is the one who both said have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord and now he's only gotten one that'll stick with him and his main man Dimas has departed having loved this present world more than the present truth and that's what brother brems pointed to now this is what he all said and sees I've never read this in 30-something years of preaching from this tyrannical I never read the rest of it I never caught that there'd be a people that would walk away then he preaches 21 days later convinced and convened concerned I had two climaxes to make I was showing them about divine healing now just two just to make you feel better I've already preached three the easy I usually have two I brought four but now I'm like right about here and I don't have anything left then that get you excited then your blood start to move a little bit you think I can make it I think I can I think I can be that little engine that could we can make it we can make it to the top tonight wait a minute this afternoon alright so I said I got two climaxes I was shown them about divine healing about visions and how God had promised everything and they were rejoicing my first climax was to tell him that all these things were the word what to get him to the real meat of it he were purpose of it and then I got to say that everybody got hungry I do preach awful long but they got hungry and they wanted to get something to eat and they started going away I said wait a minute you haven't heard it's the word and when I started to take talking back about the word and how it's done by the word everybody left it's Luke chapter 14 it's Matthew 22 you see brother branham paralleling this in every we said the people walked away the 70 left him and then he turned and said to 12 we'll use that's right I got another climax a great climax I've got to make but the sun shining bright now the evening shadows will be falling after a while they'll all be coming back again then I'll make this other climax and I raised up my hand and said glory to God I won't have to study no more because my commission in the beginning was stay with the word I'll stay with that and then when I start again I'll just background what I said and then wait for this climax he didn't have to study the preach the seals he tried that he said I would have made an awful mistake but in a time this great climax the angel comes himself so and I thought I mustn't forget and I come out of the vision and I don't know what text I had but there's another here he says it now November 25th 1962 but there's another climax coming just to sure I win any sister so that that's right here there is another climax coming at this point in his ministry he says I want to say you too you all here when the word begins to come forth you know what Peter said Lord where would we go he says stay with the word there was a few stayed I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the third pool he says stay with the word there was few stayed just a few more statements here he says it now just five days later excuse me a month later and the absolute as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming to christ i send you with a message to the world before on the second coming of christ and around the world she's went when revival fires have been built for 15 years on nearly every mountain divine healing across the nations and power and restoration and now that's great that's tremendous and now she's ready to strike that final climax yonder to bring a forth a faith that a rapture the church into glory where does it come from the opener of those seals because those seals reveal Christ he has the one that opened those selves he is those seals and rapturing faith was in the opening of that the rapture faith is in the third pool he says I believe this is coming to that this is it it's been identified as been vindicated but his caution was there's a climax they saying stay with the word don't miss that climax don't miss the point of that climax he says there was fear that stayed so what are we gonna what are we gathered around what's got our attention if the message in it is sixty two as I mentioned a moment ago we'd be left with something incomplete we would we would fellowship together in the questions of is this the sign of the answer we'd have a lot of could it be ease and I'm wondering if and my look at these and we'd still have some great things to fellowship on original sin baptism logos and Godhead all those think about all those things he mentions they're the mysteries that he mentions that we could understand had been taught and we were coming to an understanding even in those sermons we'd still have a lot to preach we still ought to say but we'd come to a place where was incomplete we'd be like Paul saying now I prophesy in part now I don't know in part but there comes a point when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with and what a lot of us do is we think this way well if this is if this is that which is perfect is come then whatever was in part I'll just do away with it so I say well we've got this now we've got this now now that we've got that we got this but there's a purpose come we just say well then that which is part is done away with and we just want to throw it away but no then this is assumed in the the whole this now makes sense the other part that which was in part now has place it has purpose it has meaning i when that which is perfect is come everything's absorb of us as we do have today the perfect interpretation of the word by divine vindication we have it so we don't have we don't have to be less left unsatisfied we don't have to be left hungry we don't have to be left run this what this isn't what I want this isn't what we should have nobody has laid it out for you if you're dissatisfied then come to this come to this word without reservation come to this word without qualification just come to him say Christ Here I am being on the meal talking to thy word with that one sumption without preconceived ideas Christ I come to you now and I come with the Commission give me the book I come with a voice reading in my heart give me the book and it's only when you've come to him and asked for it that he can tell you to take it need it nobody else can tell you to eat it and you can't eat it until he tells you to take it and eat it and you've got to come to him here they say give me the book it says my daughter take it and eat it so brother Branham says we'll invite the musicians to come I stopped reading and in that portion of is this the sign of the Insur brother Branham says the sunlight is never the light is never shined on us before look on this watch this I told him to watch that what was it I don't want to reap reach this it's that opening of the word the Seventh Seal has been revealed the third pool there's revelation of the seven thunders all these things now take it all the he says now look at that that's what I want you to look at look at the third pool watch the third pull then what we're doing is we're watching for squeeze and persecution and pressure and tightening and all that he says watch the third pull you watch that you'll be fine but if you try to figure out everything else that's happened in the world today could this could be that could be this be good no no no be certain watch this so that's what he pointed him to keep your eyes on this watch this and brother branham keeps telling it but he said while they were looking in he looked out of his corner of his eye and watched me and I slipped off to one side and started going towards the west towards the setting of the Sun coming up a hill going down a hill coming up a hill going down a hill getting smaller and smaller and went all the way out of sight here here the messenger goes off the same but he had a message before he left look on this don't watch me look on this and just as Elijah told Elijah don't take your eyes off me - you see me going aural I just said look on this watch this and then brother BAM goes off the scene and I realize maybe it's it's me adding a little bit of that flavor and color to it the brother BAM is going off the scene but Bertram's departed from our midst but he pointed to this and this is what it said and he said when I did that then the Brethren turned around after a while did he vanish where did he go because now they're starting to wonder well what does brother Brown I'm coming back where is he is there more to be fulfilled is there something else that needs to be happen and they're more concerned about him who left than what he left them they said where did he go and said some took out that way some took one way and some another he says a very few stayed and looked on what I had told them Oh hallelujah many were cold many were told look on this and I could say many have left and a few hallelujah a few have stayed oh god bless you for staying god bless you for being here in 2022 everything you've been through through every up and down and in and out you are still feeding on this hallelujah many were cold and a few stayed God bless the few god bless those that have stayed stay with the word everything from 1947 and if they discover a tape from 43 I'll throw it in there too everything is complete from 47 to 65 it's complete because it's the fullness it's complete because it was that which was promised to come it's that which was perfect family the church age book says talks about how everyone turned on Moses he said but not all the people turned on Moses and left the Word of God the elect stayed with them the same thing has happened again today many are leaving the word but some are staying with it I'm so glad we've stayed it that wonderful we're in we're in isn't it wonderful oh I thank God that I'm part of the few that have stayed let's let these words where a may have been a long way to get to it but what my burden isn't a time like this it's so uncertain out there it's so up and down and we don't even know if things will turn around will though tell us we can't have Church again and they'll be great things happen in the world and great calamities and deaths and governments changing and ministers not only able to travel overseas and churches split I think about a Cloverdale by the way their congregation is even unable to meet even if they tried to be creative because there's a border between them I'm so glad that no matter what's going on out there I have a voice behind me saying stay online get back and step there's a voice behind me say this is the way walk in it Oh hallelujah I'm gonna stay and look on this I'm gonna keep my eyes on this message I don't need to this world interpreting my word today I want to keep my eyes on this let's stand to our feet let the few stand and say hey man let the few rejoice in his presence let the few say I think God I'm looking at the right thing hallelujah yes our prophet may be off the scene yes there may be a lot of up and down ups and downs and some took out that way and some took out the other way but a very few stayed let's bow our heads a gracious Heavenly Father no matter what I've gone through Lord I could say I'm still looking at you I've got my eyes on you through hurts and disappointments and rippings and just the gut-wrenching ripping a part of things Lord to come to place what I felt it when I was reading a brother branham the agony of late 62 is this the end of it all is this how it winds up my ministry ending with campaign managers leaving and criticisms is everything I preached is this how it ends something began to turn the Lord he had another climax Lord through all our disappointments and all our discouragements and hurts may the bride keep her eyes on that meeting in the air for as we're walking in this great climax in this climax age it has a promise that you'll never leave us nor forsake us has a promise that you'll be with us even innocent to the very end and lord I pray that you could just encourage us today to take a look at these steps in the Word of God and know through it all I'm still standing Lord I want to place myself as it were at the top of that mountain Lord we may not be brethren from Georgia but all of us here who've gathered from all over the place Lord out of Minnesota and Michigan and Arizona North Carolina and Florida and we're all gathered just perched up on the top of that mountain looking in and we're still here and we're in Lord we'll keep our eyes on this no matter how many leave I'm gonna be one of the few that stays I pray you bless the people for their stamina even today to endure the length of this sermon the Lord I believe it's indicative of this endurance they have in your word that they're staying with it to the very end I'm gonna keep on running I'm gonna keep on pressing I'm gonna keep on going on I'm gonna keep on keeping on I'm gonna keep out of his way cuz I want to make it to the year now Lord I'm gonna make it it's already done nothing's gonna stop me cuz I'm staying with the word bless the people I pray as I commit them to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bless them amen Hey he said good morning he's on the throne [Music] are sure oh sure my singing they said good morning I got me some throne we are the second show he said good morning he is on his phone we are [Music] almost home almost home what an hour to be almost home [Music] you know I something swept over me as brother Aaron was it just seemed to put me into a different mindset and I just seemed still zooming in my mind as he began to break down that invitation to the supper hey you know I thought about all the odds I mean if you read in the Bible its ominous because all these thousands that followed him in he fed him and then they followed him no more and all of these that he sent these invitations to and none of them common it went in the hedge in the highways and found him good and bad I'm glad they found some bad ones hey man it gave me some hope compelled him to come because there was a supper ready you look at the 70 who walked away and and then he turns to 12 and says will you go also and I I got thinking I thought you know I and I'm not changing the the scripture of the crib the scripture says they went away from him and I sit there thinking with what he did but he said I'm wondering did they go away or did they get sent away you know and I'm thinking about all of this in combination and it's just building in my mind I'm thinking my goodness and even the 12 even one of them was a devil and then he comes to Paul and you come there where demas has forsaken me and this one has gone here and this one is here and this one is there and only Luke is with me and you know and Anna and you just you just think about this whittling down rolling down and then I come to think about this there really is a marriage supper that's prepared Jesus truly does have a tablespread and I'm not just talking about a feast in the word I mean friends in a very real place in a very real dimension there is going to be a very real table real miles thousands of miles long with real chairs and real people that lived historically in the Old Testament the New Testament and thousands of years and you're really gonna sit in a chair across from and reach across and shake their hand well that's worry about social distancing because there won't be no viruses there and that is a real event and when I when that begin to set down upon me I almost felt ah hard to describe almost like a knot in my stomach to think what if I didn't see it what if I what if I couldn't see this of all of these all these that were there and saw it and walked away and all these that were there and predict of it and were sent away and all these that were there and missed out on it and only a very few state how did I end up getting to be a few say some people say how am I going to make it to the end well I just say I don't know how I got here all I know is God rich and mercy love me open my eyes I see it I can't help it so I'm not too worried about him getting me the rest of the way hallelujah the God who found me and bring me home Oh friends you know I if you're if you're here today and you're gonna try to so now qualify all that in your mind to say or here's why I believe it here's why well I saw that wel maeín saw and don't believe well God did that well God did millions of things for millions of people who don't yet follow it you know well but it makes sense if it made sense to them to make sense to the devil the message makes sense to the devil he knows it's true when I just want to let me just cut to the chase for you if you're trying to figure out how you earned it just listen you didn't you figure out how trying to figure out how you deserve this you don't so you know what you do you just lean back and just say grace God's grace and you know what if I really am if I if we really are and I believe we really are at the at the end of the end time for man's history and we are almost home and the world is falling apart in an unprecedented way that's not my language that's politicians language scientists language business owners language Wall Street's language they said it's unprecedented we're an uncharted territory you know it should be that if you're that close to home we should the world should be at what you see happening is should be happening if we're that close to that table in the sky and that being the case I won't say if that's the case I'll say that being the case because it's evidently so then yeah I get it i get how brother branham thought mine is this the signing I still got loved ones I still got people I care about who aren't who aren't who aren't in the fold yet then I just say what a greater time to fall back on the grace of God and say Lord I'm I'm gonna start speaking the word I'm gonna claim all my loved ones all my family all my children all my parents oh my can all of you love me all those who I love I'm here today some friends you know you're not to limit the God of Israel so I just say if I'm in this kind of an hour that I'm gonna go big and I'm gonna say Lord I want to become a perfect man I want to have all my family with me I want to be at the table I want to get on with this thing and I'm just gonna say in the name of Jesus Christ let it be so you have arrived at such an hour as this my goodness well it has been a great day to be in the house of God are you happy okay amen I'm appreciate the Lord Jesus been here with us came and visited us in our Sunday School class and then carried us into the afternoon and it has been a spiritual gastro Jubilee amen so we're happy in the Lord happy to have had brother Aaron here I I hate that it just the one-stop shopping today but amen amen you can bring those four again and bring four more next time we're gonna try to get him back again next month would be hosting ministers meeting here so he he and his family and I told him such Elizabeth makes sure brings y'all to amen stay another week a man praise the Lord that just be good or and good that's how you go from good to gooder so we're happy in the Lord I sure thank all of y'all for coming out today amen we're gonna sing it again and we'll let you go and be dismissed and I just want to say God bless you just to the whole church to you here to the audience streaming say brother Jason when are we gonna be back to normal I wish I had an answer for that we're just having to play it by ear we don't know even the authorities and scientists the best minds in the world don't know how this is going to go they're only speculating they're estimating they're thinking well maybe and so I can just tell you if it if it keeps releasing and the government keeps relaxing and I'm what I'm having to watch the attitude remember friends we we've come this far protecting our testimony it was the only reason we did it because we're protecting their testimony in the community so I've got to know it's not just based on while the governor said okay you know no holds barred well I've got to
