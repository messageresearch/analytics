TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you all right we on all right um let's all stand have a word of prayer your lord ask that you be with us this morning we invite you into our midst as you anoint the words that i'm going to speak and anoint my my thoughts and my spirit and anoint the ears of the people that might hear something we might be able to give them a little bit of a little extra ammo on their in their gun to fight the devil we ask these things in jesus name amen all right so i want to um start by um turning to mark chapter four we'll just read a quick scripture and have you all sit down um all right and so the first part of the chapter here is god giving some or jesus rather giving some parables and then it comes down to verse 10 and it says and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto him that are without all these things are done in parables that seeing they may see and not perceive in hearing that they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them um and then we i want to skip down to uh where to put that um and then come down to verse 33 and um and with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear it but without a parable spake he not um sorry without a parable speaking not unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples and y'all can y'all can be seated so um i want to for a topic for a title i i put down the exclusivity of god because one of the things that i've i've seen throughout the bible and i'm sure we've we're all we've all seen is there's god throughout the entire bible has always drawn a line of separation between his family and the rest of the world um i mean you even see with and oftentimes that line does not run down human genetic lines either you see with abraham god told him to separate from his father and lot who is his cousin because there's there's a spiritual genetics and then there's a natural genetics and those two things are not always associated with each other very often times they're not and so but and so here we have jesus showing where he his message is not to everyone everyone can hear it but they're going to hear an encrypted version of it they're going to hear a version of it that's going to be um filtered through you know through parables and and it's not going to be clear but to the people to his exclusive people just the 12 around him they're going to get the unencrypted version of that um uh and and so i want to jump down to um uh verse 35 in chapter four and it says and the same day when the even was come he said unto them let us pass over onto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there was also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hindered part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they wake him saying to him master cares thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have have have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him now i want to point out something and i'm very familiar with this scripture i'm sure we all are but there was something that i picked up that i had never i was reading through the gospels again recently and i'd never caught this before and it says in verse 36 and and it doesn't after the storm because the disciples boat was sinking they were gonna you know they were gonna sink if he hadn't calmed the storm and it doesn't mention those other boats now it's maybe a little bit of speculation i don't know because it doesn't say what happened to them but i i mean to me when i read this it shows that maybe god is causing this storm to come along to get rid of all the people who he he doesn't need there right here's these disciples and because they're going if you continue reading they're going to kadera to meet the the insane man in the tombs the devil possessed man and maybe god doesn't need all these people going there right um we'll pick it up later in um in the book of luke when he goes to um jarius's house to raise the dead daughter he has to kick all these people out of the house because their faith is so bad they have such little faith and they're so um distracted um or they so distract from from the miracle that's about to happen and so um they have such a doubt that he couldn't have raised that little girl if they'd have been there so so maybe and so a lot of times i find that when we're in when we're going through storms in our lives maybe the whole point of that is that god is trying to remove things he's trying to shake off all the other little boats in our lives because we're going into you know there's there's gonna be deliverance on the other side and you can't have all this other stuff causing doubt that maybe if all those other people would have showed up on the shores of gadara that devil possessed man might not have been able to get deliverance or maybe and this is the other thing and i i consider this as well because when those devils were cast out they would god sent them into the pigs if there's a big crowd there maybe god doesn't need a big crowd there because in dealing with that those people might have been under attack by those devils when they left that man you don't necessarily know it might not necessarily have been that they were bad people because they were following jesus after all it might have just been that it was almost for their own good that god would have put that storm in the lives of those people particularly because of what they where they were going and what they were doing wow so um so i i um uh let's see here um and and or we could look at it at the sake uh added sort of another perspective and that is as i mentioned before the exclusivity of god that here is god's chosen people the 12 in this boat these are the god's closest people the jesus's closest people people that he's hand picking and their boat's the only one that makes it right because and and we see all the chaos and things around us in the world i mean craziness you got the russia and trying to create bonds with china and what's going to happen with the monetary system and gas prices are four dollars a gallon and it's there you know experts are saying it's going to go even higher and all the crazy things that are happening all the storms that are hitting the world right now and all the little boats are getting hit but there's only one boat going to make it out and that's the one with jesus in it right and so it's and now the only people who are going to be in that boat are the ones that jesus has hand-picked right he didn't hand pick all because and we'll pick this up again hopefully if we have time running through my time um there's a there's a point at which there there are many disciples because it actually says here um if we read that go back up where it talks about uh in verse 10 um it said um when he was alone and they that were about him with the twelve so there were other disciples and and talks about this later when he talks about um eating my flesh and drinking my blood and all they were all like oh how can we hear this is so this is he's a cannibal right well it talked about how all the disciples left yeah so he had many disciples but there were only 12 hand-picked one that he picked himself lots of people heard his teachings and came to him but only the ones that were specifically chosen the specific ones like the exclusive people who actually stuck through them stuck with it through all the all the difficulties and um so i actually want to uh uh oh i'm sorry i didn't mean luke i meant john um so i want to jump down to john chapter six um oh um and we'll start at verse one and it says after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee which is the sea of tiberias and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did um uh on them that were diseased and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he said unto philip when shall we buy bread that they may eat um and this he said to prove to prove him for he himself knew what he would do philip answered him 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them uh may take a little um let's see um and of his disciples andrew simon peter's brother said unto him there's a lad here which have uh five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many and jesus said make the men sit down and there was much grass in the place of the men sat down in number about five thousand and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and disciples to them that were sat down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would and when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost and therefore they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above them that had eaten um and so we we know this story um it's pretty uh we you know i mean you get through sunday school you're going to hear the story um but and then i want to jump down to um verse 22. um and the day following when the people stood on the other side of the sea oh so let me let me pick something else here before i move on um so between that story and the um where i'm picking up now is a story in which the the disciples go out on the boat and jesus walks in the water and meets them out in the sea okay and so they they get to the other side and so here's all these other people the people they left behind who had gotten they he where he just fed 5 000 they're also still waiting on the near side of the side of the shore and that's where we're picking up in verse 22. and the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw there was none um other boat there save that one where unto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone how big there came um other boats from tiberias i under the place where he did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus so here's all these people they just get a big belly full because jesus feeds feeds them all on five loaves and two fishes and they're like wow this is crazy we gotta follow this guy and so they all jump in boats and cross the sea looking for him okay um uh and then it comes down we're gonna come down to um uh okay and it says and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when cometh thou hither and jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because he saw the miracles not because ye saw the miracles but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent and they said therefore unto him what signs show us thou then and see let's let's catch this they said therefore unto him what sign show us thou then that we may see and believe thee what dost thou work show us a sign you're saying that you're of god show us a sign that you're of god okay our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you that true giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world so here's a bunch of people who one day a man multiplied bread in front of them they ate it they crossed the ocean and then asked him well moses gave us bread from heaven what can you do right he he literally gave them the sign that they were looking for he'd done it right in front of him they ate it right they ate the same bread they had literally partaken of the sign and completely missed it right and and so this is why jesus isn't giving him an inch because he's recognizing that they're they're not his exclusive people right the disciples the 12 that were with him they recognized because you know they were with them through the thick and the thin and in different different gospels kind of show different things um not every gospel has all the same stories and if you if you parallel these stories together you see that right around this time is when he goes up one mountain transfiguration it's right around this time that that peter's saying well surely you're the son of god it's the 12 are recognizing who he is okay and if we keep reading down um which i think i'm going to have to maybe uh i might have to skip some of this because of time um and i want to come down um uh and so the i guess i guess where i'm i'm coming to is at the end of this story it's when he's talk is where he hits them with the um you know you eat my eat my flesh drink my blood you know this is the bread of life and this is where they they get all they get all put off right all these people who had followed him across the ocean are suddenly like well okay we don't understand this and so what this is showing is this and we know this is jesus did this on purpose he did this to separate all the people away from him who weren't his his selected few right only the 12 stuck around because he turned to them and well aren't you going to leave two and they said well no you have the words of eternal life so what's the what's the what's the the takeaway from this is that a lot of times god is going to either through storms or just through the hardness of doctrine you might say going to separate people a lot of times there's gonna be a lot there's gonna be a lot of crowds but if you're holding to the word and holding to the message of the hour as close at it to the letter a lot of people are going to look at that and turn away because they're not they're not seeing they're not the chosen few who have seen the the the living christ in that right and so and so and we know that god does this on purpose because he's he's being exclusive he's being selective he only wants those chosen few right now everyone has an opportunity and this is this is a um uh something that i know i struggled with for a lot of my life and until brother jason actually clarified something for me and that is everybody has a chance to do this but genetics are still genetics god doesn't pick his family necessarily you just are who you are because of what your genetics are there's a there's a spiritual genetics and there's a natural genetics and those two things might necessarily um run in parallel but you still have spiritual spiritual genetics and it's not like god is going out and picking winners and losers it's just that some people are his kids and some people aren't right you know and and the other side of this and so i was it was actually this morning i was thinking about this i'm like well it's kind of hard for me to identify with that i guess because i don't have kids i mean i am somebody's kid but it's it's kind of hard to see it from god's perspective because i don't it's different but then i did realize one thing the other thing that is very exclusive is a marriage i am married and i know that i'm exclusive with my wife because that's what a marriage is if you god has to be exclusive with his bride because otherwise it's not a marriage right the whole the whole purpose the whole the whole uh plan of salvation was for god to be exclusive to to create a family that he that is exclusively his because the entire world is not fit to be god's bride not everyone wants to be god's bride not everyone wants to be married to god and so there's a lot of people who in today's age gets really bothered because there's this whole spirit of the age about oh well inclusivity everyone's got to be included we can't exclude anybody nobody you know everything's got to be for everybody you know everything's got to be for everybody well is it though god doesn't think that way right not everything is it god isn't for everybody um you know there were in the garden of eden there was adam and eve and those were god's children the serpent and the bible doesn't really mention a mrs serpent but if there was they wouldn't be part of god's family right and so the whole problem the whole fall of man was down to eve not being exclusive and so clearly this is going to create a situation in which case god has to be exclusive god and it's and and um a lot of people this hurts a lot of people's feelings because it's like well it's not fair it's not fair the people who aren't it's you know nothing that you can really do well you know it and it's it's almost like it's hard it's a hard thing to think about drawing lines of separation because you know we know that a lot of times like i said before a lot of times those lines aren't necessarily on human genetic lines a lot of times the lines of separation run down the middle of middles of family of human family and it and it hurts a lot um or even through you know through friends and things like that um but i want to pick up something from i want to read chap isaiah chapter 39 with the last couple minutes that i've got here um it's a pretty short chapter and i'm going to try to read the whole thing um and it says at that time uh meredith balon the son of baylen king of babylon sent letters and presents to hezekiah for he had heard that he had been sick and was recovered and hezekiah was glad of them and showed them the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the um and all the house of his armor and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah showed them not then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said there come from a far country unto me even from babylon then said he what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah answered all that is in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not showed them then said isaiah to hezekiah hear the word of the lord of hosts behold the days the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried to babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord and thy sons shall issue from thee which thou shalt begat shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon then he said hezekiah then said hezekiah to isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken he said moreover for there shall be peace and truth in my days so this is you know we've heard this story a lot and what it really comes down to is here's hezekiah who was a good king he was you know he was the first king to walk you know in all the ways of god according to his father david right he completely destroyed all these idols he had been this absolute champion for the for the word of the lord and then at the end his his whole kingdom kind of comes apart because some people outside of the family of god outside of israel came to him with some gifts and some nice words and said wow we heard that you were sick and you got better and you know we just brought you a present to tell you how much we appreciate that you got sick and we like you so much and he went and made friends with him and they got he got really close to some people who were outside of the family of god because they showed him some kindness and he wasn't supposed to have done that and the reason he wasn't supposed to have done that it wasn't it was because they were false at the end of the day those people were under the dominion of satan and the en who's the enemy of god no matter how nice people are outside of you know the message of the hour you have to be careful because anyone who's not holy ghost filled is a pawn of satan he they're under his control and that's that's an unfortunate thing but it's the it's the fact and here you have hezekiah making a lot of he's going and showing off his kingdom oh you know making friends with him looking oh look at how wonderful all my things are and look at how rich i am and you know really showing them a good time taking them all the you know the nice places and and maybe throwing him a nice party failing to recognize that those people are only there to to spy him out so that babylon can come in and take all that stuff from him right he's showing them all the wealth that he has not realizing that they weren't there on god's behalf they're there on satan's behalf right and so this is the reason why god draws lines of exclusivity between his family and the rest of the world because at the end of the day those people who you end up making really deep connections with who are not part of god's family they're the ones who are going to end up causing you a lot of heartache they're the ones who are going to end up taking things from you spiritually and it a lot of times it's painful and it's not fun and especially when people are nice and they're they have a nice exterior they're very they're very respectful and things but you still have to be careful about who you are um as i said creating very deep emotional ties to because it's it's as you know again when i was a teenager brother jason said something that really struck me and it's always stuck with me through my whole life and that is a lot of time god builds a wall around his people a wall of separation around his people and you can either look at it as a prison or you can look at it like a fortress either one you don't go out in in afghanistan and iraq or just any any you know foreign uh expedition the u.s goes on they're going to build bases out in the form in the enemy territory and they have the wire they call it the wire right it's the barbed wire they put around the base and they when you talk about going outside the wire you're no longer in the protective barrier around that base and if you're going outside the wire to go create relationships with people outside that wire you don't know what's going to come with that there's a famous story in afghanistan of a u.s soldier who he's he's there he's at the base he's in some foreign city he creates a relationship with a girl a local a native girl there um and he starts doing what he's not supposed to do and he starts sneaking outside the wire to go see her well one day he goes to go have dinner with her and her cousins and brothers are there and they kill him because they were taliban and he didn't know that and the whole thing was a lure and he wills and creates a relationship with someone outside the wire and a lot of times we have to be careful and so in his mind he's thinking oh this this this barricade around this base it's it's containing me it's holding me back it's it's holding me in but the reality is no it's to keep the people who are in the control of satan from harming you and you have to be very careful and very selective and and build those strong ties with the people within your fortress and uh we're we're uh out of time here so we'll stand and have a word of prayer lord ask that you we thank you for this this word that you've given us as they would be able to help the people and whatever they might be dealing with and give them some uh some uh an edge to fight the devil we thank you for this and dismiss the people uh into the service and the worship service as you bless the servants to come we thank you in jesus name amen you yes you
