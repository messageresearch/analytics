========================================

father we just come before you this morning Lord and father you see what I have before me Lord I just pray may you anoint it Lord may you anoint their ears to receive father I just need your help Lord and father may you just bless this service the singing the fur part the ministry coming out Lord we just want to remember brother Jason Tomar is this this morning Father as he's probably already preached one of three services maybe only the second one now but Lord L May you go give my brother strength Lord be with brother Jason this morning as he brings forth the word to minister to us we ask in Jesus name amen you turn these monitors down um if you have your bibl let's turn to Second Peter chapter 1 and we'll start with verse 5 read down to verse 8 and besides this give all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godless brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ may God add His blessings you can have your seats I put a title to this to making of a perfect man the definition of make is to bring in into being by forming you know Genesis says in the beginning God created the heavens and earth that the Earth was without form and void and so what he done he started bringing it into being so to make is to bring into being by forming shaping or altering a material amen so if we're going to be made perfect who you going to be made after what image is God wanting us to be because he tells us in Matthew 5:48 be ye therefore perfect which that definition is brought to its end finished amen be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect wanting nothing necessary is completed amen so whatever perfect is if you're perfect this morning you're completed you have reached the goal and I was speaking to the youth uh Friday night we started a little little thing on the Holy Spirit what is the Holy Spirit and brother I read a quote where brother Bram says that the goal that our our goal should be to obtain the Holy Ghost and I kind of miss it to them like it was our ultimate goal the ultimate goal is to receive the Holy Ghost now if you rece I told him if you receive the holy ghost in your soul you have reached that ultimate goal because your but we know brother BR says once you got your Holy Ghost your soul is already in eternity but there's things that has to take place as we go along becoming a Christian we have another goal we have a goal to reach the stature of a perfect man you know brother BR preached that message if he ain't heard it in a while you should go back and and listen to it it's a stature of perfect man he didn't say statue of a perfect man you know what a statue is it just something stands up strong and it don't move and it's it's hard and solid but a stature the stature is a quality or a status gained by growth or development or achievement Man full grown you're an adult a full age you're mature so that's why would become a perfect person so what what is it be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect that's who would be making into the image of of God so you know one day you were born in sin you come to the world speaking Lies We Were Lost we had no hope we were wandering around in the darkness we were without form and void we weren't in any shape any form that God could even use us we were just a bunch of heathens walking around that's what we were bunch of heathens because he without God you're a heathen doing what we wanted to do but all we needed was a Potter not just any Potter but the Potter we didn't need any man to come and mold us but we needed the man the man Christ Jesus in Jeremiah 18:1 it says the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise go down to The Potter's House and there I will cause thee to hear my words and then I went down to The Potter's House and behold he wrought a work on the wheels amen and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel has seemed good to the Potter to make it and then the word of the Lord came unto me saying oh House of Israel or should I say oh bethl Tabernacle can I not do with you as this Potter sayith the Lord behold as the clay is in The Potter's hand so are ye in my hands oh bethl Tabernacle you know he's the Potter we're the clay so what happens when that lump of clay gets into the Potter's hand you know when a Potter starts with a piece of clay it's hard he just looks at at it he can't do anything with it it's stubborn he wants everything his way he doesn't want anyone to tell him what to do the sin of the world has made him a hard person you get where I'm going I'm going to live any way I want to so Potter would just kind of walk by and he just look at it like and kick it be like what am I going to make out of this thing I'm trying to I'm trying to behave so I told I went ahead and apologize to brother Jason this morning in advance I said I'll try not to preach this the Potter he'll walk by he'll give it a kick and'll say what am I going to do with this what am I going to make out of this amen seemed like an impossible task the poter will walk by look at that Clump lump of clay and he kind of scratch his head says what in the world am I going to do you just like God he walked around us one day and he walked around he said oh man Brad Y and you don't have to amen this he is sorry low down good for nothing just kind of what am I going to do with this thing it seems impossible to some of us of the lives that we have lived you know you wonder what what would what did God even see in us when he walked by us and see what kind of shape we were in cuz we were shaped in sin born in born in sin this you know he walked around he's just a hard stubborn piece of clay but when the Potter comes and picks up that hard piece of clay he just looks at it he sees a potential there amen he sees a potential finished product amen it doesn't doesn't matter what the clay look like at the beginning amen hallelujah the Potter has an image in his mind on what the finished work would look like he looks he looks at this thing he goes that piece of Potter right there I can make a cup out of that one I can make a vase or maybe that one a plate but he has in his mind the Potter looks at that clay in his mind he says you'll be a vase amen and so the clay becomes what is in The Potter's mind you know like Michelangelo when he was sculpting the the image of Moses and it took him a while the the more he chipped away at at Moses and this image the more he did the more real it looked to to Michelangelo it looked so real he said this thing should talk and so what did he do he took his hammer he he was so he was so inspired by the image of Moses he said speak and he smot him then Moses became a perfect image being smitten that's what happened to Jesus Christ he become perfect man when he was smitten and the brother BR said the bride has been smitten just like Christ was that's what makes us perfect so God looked at me he didn't see all my faults amen he looked beyond my fault and saw my needs it wasn't what I needed it's what he needed me to be yes he I needed hope I needed saving I needed salvation I needed Deliverance so that's what God's seen in me Hallelujah so when that Potter picks up the clay the only way he was going to be able to do anything with the clay was to put water on it he had to justify the clay so the Potter must put water to soften it up so he can use it you know what sounds like to us before we were saved we were hardened by this world no one could do anything with us but one day God said it's time it's time for you to come in amen so you come to a church service under the preaching of the word god convicts your heart and you come running up to the altar tears are streaming down your face father forgive me God God forgive me of my sins God forgive me of what I've done God forgive I'm sorry Lord and you truly repenting and then the preacher then you come up to the preacher and he baptizes you with water he's justifying you so now you're he's God he's got water on this clay he's able to mold you to make you what you need to be the preachers took you and baptize you you started softening up and now God the Potter can start working on you amen notice when that Clay is on the wheel and that wheel is spinning the clay is always in his hands molded into an image that is in his mind so while the clay is on the wheel the Potter just don't turn around and walk off and leave you there cuz if the Potter did that it just start going everywhere it just become a mess but the Potter keeps his hands on it and so while the thing is and he is molding a vase a beautiful vase to be used and so he keeps molding it and molding and shaping at the beginning you can't tell what it's going to be amen at the beginning when you get saved you don't know what you're going to be but God says I have you in the palm of my hand says Jeremiah says behold I have Graven thee in the palms of my hand so God can't forget who you are he can't walk away and say forget you you're already in his hands he's already got you on the wheel and he's molding it and he's and he's and he's spinning the wheel and shaping and molding you to his very image that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world what an image signifying that God is always in his sight his eyes were ever upon them he never withdraws from them has everything is held in his hand so the clay is always in the hand of the Potter so the clay becomes what is in his mind amen I must say it might be a vase or a cup or whatever is in The Potter's mind he will mow that's what the clay becomes you know that clay just don't become anything it wants to amen you know a part of might say hey I want you to be a cup but this he says I don't want to be a cup I want to be a plate so if God called you to be a deacon don't try to preach amen if God called you to be a trustee don't try to preach if God called you to be a preacher don't be a trustee or a deacon you be what God's called you to be amen sometimes I wished I was brother Luther and brother Luther was up here then I could be mean sorry love you brother that was free so we we are in the hands of God molded into his very image Hallelujah sometimes a Potter must take out a sharp knife and start digging stuff out of you digging stuff that should there's a rock there let me get that rock out you know sometimes during the preaching of the word the preacher up here has a sharp tool and he starts digging and you start hurting go ahead and say ouch it's okay Amen Let Let preacher and God know it oh he just took something hard out of my life maybe there's something else that needs to be in there maybe God needs to take a little tool and start taking out your bitterness taking out your envy and strife and your hard feelings and and your grudges and and start shaping you cuz you can't be a smooth little vase with a rock sticking out of you glory to God he'll dig out that temper he'll dig out that lust the jealous Spirit whatever that's in you that is hindering the Potter from creating that Perfect Image in his mind Romans 9:18 says therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth thou Willl say thou then unto me why does he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will nay but oh man who art thou that repliest against God Amen shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why in the world did you make me a cup yeah sometimes I do that why in the world did you make me a preacher I would just like to sit there with my wife ever service and just run sound why hast Thou made me thus but hath not the Potter power over the clay amen of the same lump he made one vessel unto honor and unto another dishonor so what if God willing to show his wrath and do make his power known endureth with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction wow here's your predestination and he might make known to The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had off a four prepared unto Glory predestination he chose he knows who's going to be he's got vessels of honor and vessels of Dishonor we know Ephesians 1:4 according as he chose us in him before the foundation world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predes destinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen so hath not the Potter power over the clay the power the Potter has over the Clays to shape it into what form he pleases and out of it to make what vessel he pleases for what purpose he thinks fit amen so he's got a plan for any one of you young people he's got something you're going to fit into he's molding you which will I like this for what purpose he thinks fit which will be most to his own Advantage so whatever God's making you it's to his Advantage not ours the unlimited power which God has over us in which God is represented to as the Potter and the man as the clay cuz as I Isaiah 648 says but now oh Lord Thou Art the father we are the clay Thou Art the Potter we all are the work of thy hand amen so if the Potter has such power over the clay you talking about the reg a natural Potter has such power over the clay which he did not make he went out and bought it and is it has it in his possession how much more has God a power who has created the clay to a point out of it persons to different uses and purposes he'll make some Housewives some Farmers some Factory workers some Carpenters some computer techs Hallelujah of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor all the clay cannot be used cuz some of it is bad amen and the Potter can't use it so he'll just throw it away but there's some clay that is predestinated to life that's what he uses to honor so whatever God is making you you're going to honor you're for his honor Hallelujah in the hands of God as Jeremiah says it says you are in the palms of his hands how can he forget you if you are in his hands and then we can be sure that if you are he's molding you he is the Potter we're the clay God is molding us into his very image so what happens when the Potter is finished with the molding of the clay he then lets it Harden for several days and then he'll take it into the fire to be fired amen and then it becomes indestructible nothing can penetrate so it's a cup you pour water into it it stays there you get the God gives you the Holy Ghost he has put you in this fire fired you nothing can penetrate you you are indestructible am Hallelujah Am Lord fire us once the Potter is finished with a clay it has been fired glory to God then the vessel is ready for service if it's a cup it's ready to hold your favorite drink if it's a plate go get you a plate of food if it's a vase put you a flour into it it's ready for its attended use so when God has fired you you he's ready to use you for his attended use amen wow if he called you to preach it preach it if he's called you to be a deacon be a deacon if he's called you to be a trustee be a trustee if he's called you to be a housewife be one amen because God is wanting you to to use you for his intended use so when we have been fired by God received of the Holy Ghost it is time for us to Bear the fruit now we have a goal to reach the Fruit of the Spirit the making of a perfect man Bible says by their fruits you shall know them I better stop right there I better I've got more I'll just I got a couple weeks I'll do part two but molded into his very image amen that's what we get into our open scripture amen by their fruits you shall know them let God mold us let let's be what God wants us to be not what we want to be cuz if you want to be a preacher you're crazy and brother Luther says you want to be a deacon you're crazy you love him I'll cut it short it's a few minutes that way give y'all time to pray for brother Jason God bless y'all
