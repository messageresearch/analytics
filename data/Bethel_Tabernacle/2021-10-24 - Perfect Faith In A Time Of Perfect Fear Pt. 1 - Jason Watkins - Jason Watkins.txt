make a couple of quick announcements and then we're going to go right to a scripture going to have a really really special day today my we've got a number of visitors here you're all here the lord is here amen it couldn't be gooder amen we're happy to have stephen and chris here today amen so good to see them i asked steve if he uh got him a house yet and i said i have no no condemnation over prosecuting my former sheep he just laughed amen praise the lord but we're happy to have them and so happy to have brother dale and his tribe here today amen and brother andrews family god bless you we're happy to have i saw brother andrew today i i said my goodness that is a nice looking vehicle and he was in a car i better not say much i might give something away but man it was nice amen so we're we're we're happy in the lord today and we're happy to have you all back here assembling with us so we've got a number of things we're going to do and try to accomplish and we've got a number of testimonies that we're going to give and i've just been going back and forth over exactly how i wanted to stack it uh i think what we're going to probably do is i want to have a couple of prayer requests here we're going to take up some prayer requests and then i'm going to read a scripture and and we asked brother anthony to just kind of abbreviate his worship service today and then i'm going to uh preach a shortened sermon it's a little bit of a it's okay i'll get to finish it on tuesday by the way that's my first announcement that our wednesday service on the 28th is moved uh one day forward to the 27th on tuesday so our midweek service will be this tuesday because much of our av team and a lot of our equipment is going to be gone to the camp and so i'll be sending out a whatsapp reminder uh in the first part of the week so the midweek will be this tuesday and then uh after i finish up we've got to have some really good testimonies we've got brother jack here who's going to give his testimony today and i should i should probably call it his explosion today because brother jack is a 220 volt uh plug and i'll tell you what if you grab a hold of him you know it amen so but i appreciate somebody who's excited about his christianity who loves serving god brother jack loves being a christian amen he enjoys it thoroughly and you get around him and you'll start enjoying it amen so amen and and uh what the lord did marvelously supernaturally for sister kathy and uh you you you know the you were living it with us you were in prayer for our sister and she goes from an emergency life flight and 48 hours later they can't even find anything wrong with her so that's just god amen [Music] we're going to god bless you brother happy to have you with us as well today we're going to uh also have brother mark uh come and give a testimony for us and um and and i'm gonna have to skip over it quick because if i get to talking about that i won't hold up but amen you know to to have lost such a dear friend three times amen the devil took his took him three times and the lord gave him back every time and so i think the devil finally got discouraged and left amen and so um and then of course we have the supernatural experience with brother jd amen who will then anchor bring up the uh we put him on the end of the tug of war rope today amen we're trying to pull everybody into the into the glories amen and we're going to let brother jason um uh give his testimony i think sister amy's gonna have a part in that and uh that's one happy lady amen so um and of course we we invited sister kathy if she wants to come up also she's welcome to sister tabby the whole family anybody's welcome to come and testify to the glories of almighty god we've got a lot to be grateful for amen now um you can be seated momentarily i just realized also on my announcements here and i've got a prayer request that we'll get to when i when i read my opening text we would like to have brother dale and this is dangerous to bring a preacher up ahead of a preacher but brother dale is a seasoned vet so we won't worry too much about it but i know that sister joanne and the her children are going to sing a special for us today but i want to get dr smith up to give us a greeting we're so happy to have him come on brother dale amen brother doyle amen when brother dale when brother dale is in new zealand they always call him doyle brother doyle i said come on buddy amen god bless you hallelujah take your liberty for a minute and then when i go to south america they call me brother dolly dalia smith just want to bring you greetings from the saints in flagstaff uh this this morning we had a bit of an accident yesterday so if you'll remember us in prayer one of the little fellas in the church my song leaders uh little boy how old's mason four five i was on a little mini bike and he wrecked and broke his femur and they'll be doing surgery today at one o'clock arizona time uh he's a sweet little boy so if you'll remember that so anything can happen to the little ones and it gets you right right it squeezes your heart and your eyes leak amen and so just been a great uh work of the lord there in flagstaff and uh just was so encouraged when i drove up in the driveway and saw the the great work that you all done to the outside of the building it's got a you got new religion amen amen a new covering on the building it's just lovely amen and and uh brother mark you ain't going nowhere brother that's right until i go with you amen and just uh appreciate you all appreciate brother jason the prayers of saints uh keeping us before the lord the lord has given us a new venue in life and the lord has done great things uh you know bill jackson said he was going to bring me up i thought oh what would i say you know because you start dealing with something and well then all of a sudden you know you get get long-winded and that's easy for me to do but you know the the uh the the one thing that i did want to be in this testimony day uh we've had uh several that have come through our prayer lines there at home and to my knowledge the lord has healed every single one of them and uh the one that he uh healed ultimately he took him home to glory amen and so that was the ultimate healing but the lord did take one of ours uh from us but uh that was orchestrated of the lord and so but the lord has healed every person that's come through our prayer line since i've been there it's just an amazing the people's faith is so high and so he's still a healer today and so glad to have the different ones brother brother brother jason my demars my dear friend yeah i know the feeling brother jason i don't want to talk about those things because so dear and near to you you know and the thought of not finishing the race with each one of you would be more than we could bear god bless you friends we love you but joe everyone's happy birthday brother charles amen love you amen each one of you good to see my dear dear friend brother donald jackson with us this morning amen appreciate each one of you today god bless you amen [Applause] hey man sister joanne bring your team and come on up and okay i was going to yell okay amen thank you sir amen sister joe and please come ahead and sing a song for us we're going to go to a couple of prayer requests here we want to remember that one uh for the little man there and that crashed that mini bike and then also we want to continue to remember brother tony's mom and uh she's still still fighting and uh the enemy's still fighting and we're still in prayer and amen just believing everything uh for god to make it turn out wonderful there's a brother stephen buckles that we got a request from brother tim pruitt who's in the hospital uh battling covid had a rough time last night and this morning with oxygen levels and brother tim just put in a little footnote his wife is very desperate so you wives who who stood in the breach and praying for your husbands to be spared i'm sure you can relate to that amen praise the lord i know my wife's still happy to have me around amen so amen we want to and that just touched my heart so we want to pray for brother stephen as well and sister smith and then this little brother did say his name was mason amen something in that name [Laughter] amen so so we're happy that the lord spared him and is going to help him i'm sure the lord will fix him up good and i remember uh jonathan broke a shoulder pretty severely when he was i think maybe seven went over the handlebars of a bicycle and piled up on his shoulder and amen and so but the lord the lord was merciful to him and so we're thankful i know how that can go and i understand a femur break is pretty painful so want to be remembering the little guy amen we're so happy to have amen um sister joanna and sister sarah here to join i thought matt was singing with you did he chicken out or he oh he didn't practice well if you don't practice you don't get to sing with says joanne so god bless you we're happy to have them today amen [Music] two mini miles behind me to me need trials are through [Applause] too many tears help me to remember there's just too much to gain to lose too many sunsets lie behind the mountain [Music] my feet have walked through many treasures are waiting over yonder there's just too much i've crossed the hot burning desert struggling the right road to choose but somewhere up ahead there's cool clear water and defeat just one word i just don't you lose too many sunsets lie behind the mountains two mini rivers my feet have walked through too many treasures are waving over yonder there's just too much [Music] senses lie behind the mountains too many rivers my feet have walked through too many treasures are waiting over yonder there's just too much to gain to lose there's just too much to gain to lose there's just too much to gain too much to gain there's just too much to gain to lose [Music] [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord amen we uh happy to have all of them and i want to also greet isaac and daniel amen happy to have all of them today did any of the other ones come just just you two guys you okay praise the lord amen left brother kevin at home to be tortured with the girl so amen so [Laughter] amen let's stand uh back to our feet this morning and i'm going to be exceptionally studious today i'm not even going to try to get a whole thought out because i can get enough to be sufficient amen we're going to do amen i'm going to have one of those rare times where i'm going to fulfill what brother branham said and preach about a 30-minute sermon amen so and then we want to give plenty of time for our testimonies amen um and let's remember our prayer request as we get ready to go so we want to come this morning to first in romans chapter 8 and we're going to catch a couple of verses there and then we'll catch a few in 2nd peter and we'll let you be seated and we'll continue to read a little bit amen i want to speak today on a title that i've chosen faith versus fear i didn't really expect to preach that today i actually had another sermon that i'm working on i told my wife i said i said you know just because we don't have church schedule i said that doesn't turn the gift off i said i got four or five sermons that have just been piling up and i've just been making notes in all of them it's not like you can just turn that off and so it just keeps coming and so amen we've got a lot of preaching we need to do here right after we get back after camp amen romans 8 14 to 15 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are what the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father isn't it amazing that he would label the spirit of fear with bondage and i can tell you that is a universal truth that is an eternal principle fear hath torment fear is a bondage see and so i want to take today a title faith versus fear and i believe if i'm not mistaken i have a subtitle perfect faith in a time of perfect fear let's turn to second peter chapter one one of my favorite teaching places in the bible i've loved this for many years and have studied it and expounded it many times and first i'm sorry ii peter chapter 1 verses 8 through 12. now peter is going to make a case for the characteristics uh that are in christ see that are in the gene that is in you so when you're born again that's why brother branham would say everything you have needed for a rapture is in you it's not like god's got to put something to it what you've got to do is strengthen those things you've got a responsibility to make faith and virtue knowledge and temperaments and all these things strong these are the seven notable characteristics of deity that are to be living in as an expression through you that's what it means to be living for the to not miss the mark by missing the glory of god in your life we've been preaching on that so he says now concerning these characteristics verse 8 for if these things be in you and abound here's the benefit they make you that ye should neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he the watch he that lacketh these things in other words it's not saying that you've lost your salvation or you've lost your gene of god these things have just taken a backseat and you're not working on them all right the and here's what happens to you when you do that all right says but he that that is lacking in these things here's what happens to him he's blind he cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sin so you actually start dabbling back around in carnality forgetting god delivered you from that kind of stuff see wherefore the rather brother and give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if we if you do these things you shall never fall not a fringe benefit for so here's another one for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth father we thank you for your word today master and we're asking for your great grace we've read it but now it will take you to come and deliver it father we're so thrilled to be here today give us of your spirit as we look into the bread of life we commit it to you and master for brother stephen buckles who even right now is struggling with hus with covid in the hospital a desperate wife asking for prayer lord we bind together as you've saved our brothers save this brother lord you're no respecter of persons reach out o god as brother dale was testifying you've saved their lot lord save this brother father i pray for our little brother mason that you will be with those doctors may it be a perfect repair a flawless repair that he wouldn't have any residual effect going forward lord first sister smith our dear sister smith lord strengthen her and we know that she's well aged and well stricken in years but you're still god you're still god there's not there's no scripture that says we have to leave the world sick lord many of your saints just age out and go home to their reward that doesn't mean they have to be sick we're asking for her deliverance today lord father you will call her home at her appointed hour as you will all of us so what if the devil now lord we know that he tries to run in sometimes and take take lives prematurely but that's not going to work for us lord we're not going to abide that we're not going to stand by and watch that happen we rebuke the enemy in the name of the lord jesus christ and ask for her complete deliverance in jesus name lord bless us all now one and all we pray in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated and you're gonna hang out not you deb i'm sorry you're gonna brother anthony you're gonna hang out for brother jason okay good amen we're gonna keep brother anthony up here uh brother jason uh still having a little bit of weakness got to build his strength back up and and uh mind body and but amen his soul is strong amen i'm just got to get mind and body re-completely rejuvenated amen now we want to also read while we have you seated ephesians chapter 6 verses 10 to 18 and then i'm going to give you some breakdowns from other translations on our reading from 2nd peter on my powerpoint but i want to get these texts read to you first so that you can be established in what we're trying to teach you this principle today ephesians 6 10-18 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil now the first thing i want you to get your mind wrapped around is that paul in ephesians and peter in his epistle second peter chapter one where he's saying add to your faith virtue and add add to virtual knowledge and add to knowledge terms and add an ad and add and add an ad and and be fruitful and multiply these things and be strong this is what these are these are the exact same type of rubber meets the road lifestyle uh teaching that the apostles can give you today that it's not adding and adding faith and adding virtue and adding knowledge for the sake of knowledge and virtue there's a purpose behind it and the purpose behind it is that it puts on the armor of god and the purpose of having the armor of god is so you can defeat the devil and what i need to explain the purpose of defeating the devil i don't think anybody in here would need an explanation of why we need to be strong in our faith why we need to keep the devil under our feet do you realize friends that when the mighty angel descended in revelation 10 1 that he put his feet on the sea and on the land because showing that the old beast system that came up out of the sea and the and the last day beast that came up out of the land that christ had both of them under his feet both of them were under his feet there is no beast system today that has any jurisdiction over the bride of christ we are above that and every tyranny of the devil is under our feet that's why it even says he comes as a as a living cloud as a rainbow about his head because that's a covenant and his feet as pillars of fire not the pillar of fire his feet as pillars of fire because that's how he appeared in the upper room in the book of acts because that's a representation of christ dividing himself into his body and he comes in his body not corporally corporally comes at the end of the of the tribulation but he's here now in a mini-membered body uh the pillars of fire to show that every tyranny of the devil is under our feet [Applause] i thought the other day i'm gonna get a piece of scratch paper and i'm gonna write every need that i have that the enemy is attacking me on i'm gonna write a detailed request and i'm gonna slip my shoes off put it in my shoes put my feet back in it and i'm gonna walk around to show the devil that everything he's trying is under my feet [Music] [Applause] i'd invite you to do the same go home today write down every request stick them in your shoes wear them day and night and no matter what you see happening remind the devil you're under my feet buddy so this is why we put on the whole armor of god this is why you're encouraged to add to your faith don't just have it add to it because if these things be in you and abound the greek diaglot says if these things be in you and super abound then they not allow you to be to never be unfruitful they make you that you would never be unfruitful they make you have victory in your lives so verse 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against the i love the scripture watch this is so enlightening against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world see they're not rulers of us they rule in darkness we're not we're not of the night as paul said to the thessalonian church in the fifth chapter we're of the day we're not of the night remember that we're of the day see we're we're not drunken in the night we're sober in the day amen and so we're not under his jurisdiction against spiritual wickedness in high places verse 13 wherefore wherefore see where peter said add to your faith virtue add your virtual knowledge paul says wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god they're saying the same thing that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins girded about having your virtue added to your faith having knowledge attitude virtue having temperance added to your knowledge you're you're having having done all then stand there for having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness have brotherly kindness strong have temperance strong amen have your faith strong see your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace verse 16 above all taking the helmet of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked so peter is showing you that faith is in the foundation of your experience and paul is saying now take that faith and let it be your crowning helmet amen so that you're the complete man the whole man you're ready to face the enemy and it doesn't matter what he comes at you with you're ready to face him and take on any and every challenge do you see the simplicity of the word do you see the disciples knowing the evil day that would come the holy spirit was mindful so that we could come in here today and read these principles and say wow so this is how i have victory at the end time verse 17 take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always not two times a week not in a midweek and a sunday service praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit see watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints all right now i want to give you peter's uh teaching that we read for our text in my powerpoint if you go ahead and switch me out there brother matt to my powerpoint we're going to take 2 peter 1 8 to 12. this first version is going to be from the amplified amen amen we'll have it here in a second all right i'm gonna start reading and you guys get it uh just as soon as you can and just uh scroll it with me so listen carefully this is what peter said from the amplified version all right let me okay so here's faith versus fear and perfect faith in a time of perfect fear all right for as these qualities faith virtue knowledge temperance meekness amen amen for as these qualities are yours and increasingly abound in you they will keep you from being idle or unfruitful unto the full personal knowledge of our lord jesus christ now don't read yet if does that make sense to you because remember that paul speaking to i believe the i believe it was the galatian church he says i would that you come into all the knowledge of the glory of god and they were they had been believers for 30 years they've been believers for decades and paul is saying i want you to come to all the fullness he uses that word the fullness of the knowledge see so so it's not as you've heard me say god meeting you at an altar and say all right you're saved see you in the millennium come on see yes as i've said yes we are going home on the old ship of zion but he didn't save you to go down to the docks and sit on your luggage amen so so from being idle or unfruitful unto the full personal knowledge of our lord jesus christ young people you want to know how you can be victorious in school you want to know how you can keep your testimony brothers sisters you want to know how you can keep your testimony on the on the on the job or in the markets right here here's how you can be strong here's how you can overcome the wows of the devil see it'll bring you to a full personal knowledge of our lord jesus christ the messiah the anointed one for whoever believers god's family who have a gene of god that's who he's talking to listen if you doubt that go back and read the beginning of that chapter peter is clearly talking to those who've had the same new birth experience as him that's evident when you read it who he's talking to so these are born again children of god with the gene of god or well it's why you couldn't become redeemed like that so for whoever lacks these qualities in other words if they're not strong in you you get blind spiritually short-sighted this is extremely critical for fathers who oversee households because if you've got short-sightedness the devil can slip things into your home and the next thing you know it's a seat of discrepancy you didn't catch it and the next thing you know it's infected your wife your children your activities and you say man where did all this carnality where's all this rebellion where's all this anger where's all this resentment where's all this conflict coming from you were short-sighted and you let the devil come knocking at your door and you thought he was a ups man but he was actually in disguise see and he actually gave you a package you should have sent back all right watch this is the the disadvantage when you don't when you don't take peter's advice when you don't take paul's advice this is what is what happens you're spiritually short-sighted seeing only what is near to him and has become oblivious to the fact that he uh somehow missing part of 9 i think because of this brethren uh let me read it for you the last part of verse 9 i don't know why that got cut off you have become oblivious to the fact that he was cleansed from his old sins because of this brethren be all the more solicitous uh that and eager to make sure to ratify to strengthen to make steadfast that's what it means it's this practical teaching that's how you make your calling and election sure you make it vibrant you make it strong you make it healthy it has nothing to do with the fact that you're born again or you're not this is a born-again person who god is saying now be strong in the faith see all right see so you're calling an election for if you do this you will never stumble or fall lord let me live there thus there will be richly and abundantly provided for you entry into the eternal kingdom of the lord and savior jesus christ so i intend always to remind you about these things now we come to the to the holman version for if these qualities are yours and are increasing they will keep you from being useless or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ there's few things more sad than an unusable christian don't read ahead of me they'll say it again there's few things more uh sad i mean in a home as you've heard me say before a home only has two kinds of peoples two kinds of people that live in every home consumers and contributors now when you got a little bitty baby of course it's just a consumer it's gonna consume food and your time and and the family's attention it's going to consume everything you're going to have to change it bathe it feed it care for it swaddle it hold it comfort it you have to get up all hours of the night and amen amen where's brother john amen brother john amen so uh it was so funny that brother louie he's always got this sense of humor and any time a sister has a baby and goes all that labor hey brother louis would have stood up here and said it all came out good brother john is home resting amen so so he says so the person who lacks these things is blind short-sighted is forgotten he's forgotten the cleansing of his past sins now i know what i was saying that that that finally that baby grows into some age and now it's time to start blending in uh not that he's not just our she's not just a consumer but a contributor and the older they get the more that balance should go like that until by the time they're teenagers they should be completely contributing and that and i've i've the worst situations i've ever seen in counseling homes that were in chaos was i went in and the first thing i could see was that the kids were all just consumers and the mom was basically a slave that's not scriptural that's not pleasing to the lord be up and at it amen amen you got you got a home you're raised in in the truth be grateful show your appreciation see amen don't know why i'm on that but but but anyway the the principle is now just extrapolate that to god's kingdom how useless are you to god if you're just always a consumer and all you do is treat him like santa claus see you're never willing to give never willing to stretch out never willing to take up your duty see stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the saints bear the burdens of christ see that's what paul said that i may know him in the power of his resurrection and being made conformable even unto his death i want to know him in the fellowship of his sufferings even so therefore brothers make every effort to confirm you're calling an election because if you do these things you will never stumble for in this way entry into the eternal kingdom entry into the eternal kingdom and it's cut off on me again of our lord and savior jesus christ will be richly supplied to you all right you can you can take that down so now so i i'm already well into teaching and i've got to really hurry i want to try to finish in the next 10 to 12 minutes so i want to say this today that we are in an age in in that is that is in such contrast i would say that it's actually in perfect contradistinction one to the other faith is now perfect and fear is now perfect because and what has brought that about is that what brought us perfect faith god unsealed a book thank god and now you you're eating the body word of the son of man and it's you're becoming what you eat you're being transformed into what you gaze at but also this is satan's eden and the lid has been torn off of hell and now he has perfected fear in the world and this is the titanic battle this is the great epic that's going on right now god's family a little persecuted minority in the world who's saying i believe god i believe every word of god and i will not acquiesce to the devil's intimidation [Applause] that's the and that's why the devil hates you because you already got the whole world he can't but he can't stand it that he don't have you so fear i want to say this friends make some statements today before i pause and we'll pick it up on tuesday so fear to the level of unbelief and perfect faith are perfectly at odds one with another they are polar opposites now i get it i get paul spoke of in second corinthians 7 how that you know when he was there in macedonia and all the trials and the things that he went on there and paul talks about fightings without and within or fears i get that life is real i do get that we are human beings i do get that we come up on terrible situations and we are sometimes alarmed even even though jesus said be anxious for nothing we are humans so i'm not talking about you know just your your mortality and and this body of death that paul talked about we're always going to be battling this guy but i'm talking about that fear to the level of unbelief when you are failing to take god at his word that is the original sin was unbelief in god's word that's the original sin the act that took place was only a result of that you understand so so what was the lie that the world is to believe at the end time because it's not just eli where the king james word said that they should believe a lie and be damned by it brother branham said no that's actually the original lie and the lie was that you could reason away god's word and be okay well that's not true you can't do that if you reason away god's word you die period soul so so fear to the level of unbelief and perfect faith are at perfect odds one with another and so you know this this human fear notwithstanding i get you know what's in our flesh and we're mortal beings but but i'm talking about fear to where you're afraid to act upon god's word and i want to make this statement that that fear to the level of unbelief perfect let me just say this way perfect fear or perfect faith those are mutually exclusive terms they can't both be true in a person you understand they're mutually exclusive brother branham taught us that that he said now you've got all kinds of senses you've got five in your flesh five in your spirit but he says down in the soul that only has one sense faith or doubt it's either born again or it's not there's no half christian you're either all born again or you're not born again and so therefore that that perfect faith which is a revelation sovereignly given to you by god and and and fear that dominates the age or unbelief in god's word they're mutually exclusive you can't they can't both be true in you amen so so we find then that when we think about what should encourage our faith well to me one of the things that i think all by itself that should encourage our perfect faith is that is that i am serving a being i want you to think about this with me a being who with just his word created everything the entire universe and all of its innumerable galaxies and the galaxies have a nearly innumerable stars and there's more galaxies than there are grains of sand on all the beaches in the earth that's a scientific fact and there's a god that did all of that and it all works synchronously and harmoniously and he did it all with nobody to help him he didn't need anybody's help he just spoke it and it became that's the kind of god whose child i am that's the being that i came from and if that's how he operated why would i think to not operate that way brother branham said he spoke and then god had to turn around and believe his own word oh hallelujah then let us speak the word of god let us put it on our lips and let us believe it today it can surmount any obstacle it can defeat any devil any time any place under any circumstance [Applause] see now i'm talking something deeper than just i get there's human spiritual gymnastics that we're given for instance the right mental attitude toward every promise of god will bring it to pass well that's true on sinner or saint the right mental attitude brother branham would see ill-famed women come through the line and get their healing because the right mental attitude toward any promise of god will bring it to pass in anybody amen you believe that and and that's why there are certain laws of nature you know giving if you give the bible says if you give god will cause men to give under your bosom it's a law of reaping and sowing ties and offerings we we took up our ties and offerings here as we normally do that's a promise of god that works in nature that could no more fail than the sun could refuse to come up tomorrow just as sure as the sun comes up if you faithfully bring the lord back his portion over everything you have because he gives you everything you have then then it's impossible for the enemy to keep the blessing from you and if he tries god will rebuke him [Applause] in contradistinction fail to give god be a thief keep god's portion for yourself then there's no way to keep the cursing coming from coming upon you and praying to god to take it off won't do you any good i'm not preaching on that today preaching on faith but i'm just trying to show you by examples in the word of god and so the same being that created the universe the whole heavens and the earth and all life on it by his word alone who needed no help from anybody that's the same one that calls you by the message and purifies your life i don't just want forgiveness for my sin i want sanctification i want to be purified i don't just want to be forgiven i want to be cleaned i want to be empowered i want to be strengthened i want to have faith see amen so how then would we not want to lay aside this is a fair question i think how would we not want to lay aside every weight that hinders us from this access and this result how would we not give all of our life to that now that we see it taught so clearly in the word of god you see to me and this is just brother jason this is just the angle and maybe i'm weird but to me this is why i connect second peter to when in our text when we read from second peter in ephesians six and we read from romans eight to me they all go together you're not given the spirit of fear you're giving the a sound mind you're given the spirit of adoption we're we're adding to our faith knowledge and adding adding to virtue and adding to virtual knowledge and we're we're putting on the whole armor of god we're sho our feet are being shot our helmet is being put on our breastplate is being readied because we want to have that same god that created the whole world with just his word operating in me see by his word and and then here's a here's a fourth connection i make to me i could have read the text and i'm going to close with this this is what i see as the most valuable aspect of the command to redeem the time amen to me what we're talking about that is redeeming the time and and and i i heard a wonderful recording and i shared it with my whole family in fact and it was on this particular scripture redeeming the time did you know that that time is the most valuable thing redeem the time time is the most valuable thing you have time is more valuable than money you can make more money but you can never make more time [Applause] amen and i mean if somebody said to you today i'm gonna i'm gonna deposit 86 400 into your bank account every day every one of us would be jumping up and down we wouldn't even need the spirit to hit us we'd be running the aisles whether brother anthony was singing or not what's the catch there's no there's no catch it's free it's yours and i'll do it every day the only rub the only caveat is that at the end of each day every bit of that money you haven't spent i take it back you don't get to carry it over and double up the next day now don't worry the next day i'll give you another 86.4 but the 86 400 that i put in your account today if you don't spend it all i'm reclaiming it and it's not going to carry over we love carryover plans we love for verizon to give us carryover plans there's no carryover plan buddy if somebody told you that you you talking about going on a spending spree you wouldn't let one cent of that go to waste you would you'd spend your whole eight or ten or twelve a week waking hours making sure every day you spent eighty six thousand four hundred dollars well you see you're actually given in every 24 hours 86 400 seconds of time and god deposits in your life every day six thousand four hundred seconds the only caveat is you don't get to carry it over into the next day he'll give you another eighty six four but what are you doing with the 86 four he gave you today to me this is redeeming the time to me i mean to me you know i mean what what real let me ask you this question what reel and brother jack get ready come on up here and sit beside brother anthony so i know you're ready amen amen is your prettier half coming up you're gonna do it by yourself okay all right amen i want to ask you this question redeeming the time it's not just about i want to say this real clear it's not just about making my time more valuable or taking some classes on prioritizing and maximizing efficiency it's not that's not the bible redemption of time because i want you to think about this what real and eternal good would it do you to redeem your fixed time that you have in the earth to redeeming to to to redeem your fixed time that would not maximize the opportunity to put on the whole armor of god what real good would that do you if you tried to redeem your cronus time and you never took it and part of that redemption was not putting on the whole armor so that you could defeat the enemy your redeeming of your time had nothing to do with adding to your faith virgin virgin knowledge and knowledge temperance you just decided yeah that's a good point i heard the preacher say today i get 86 400 seconds i'm going to i'm going to be more i'm going to go take a college class on maximizing efficiency oh you say wouldn't that be a benefit sure to your fixed time but why do i care so much about my fixed time i'm looking for my eternal time i want to have something in the on this side of eternity that counts on the other side i want to live for the purpose that god has put me here that's how i'm going to redeem my time so i'm so i'm going to stop giving so much of my fixed time to the nonsense of laodicea and i'm going to go back to god's word remember remember the thing that created everything remember the thing that created all the universe and all those galaxies and and put vegetation on the earth and gave you life i'm gonna give my i'm gonna redeem time with him i'm gonna redeem time i'm gonna spend more time with him i'm going to redeem my valuable time god bless you let's stand to our feet and give you a change of position let's pray father we thank you for your wonderful word today and i i know lord that in an audience father of this size and no doubt across the airwaves many lord of your children i would say all of your children are are always greatly affected by the ministry of the word lord we preached it as passionately as i felt it i preached it with the same faith that i believe it i i i was serious lord i'm i'm in this pulpit today and everything that i preached i stand by it and i say lord grant it to me grant that the power of god could be more alive in my life grant my determination that i redeem my time more and spend more time with the one who all by himself with no other help just his word created everything how would i neglect spending time with that being who in the right mind would do that it goes to show lord because the reality of the work of the world is that the overwhelming majority so much so that those who who redeem their time are almost an imperceptible number on a graph so it seems so upside down it proves definitively that the world has gone insane that there is no concern about these kinds of things people look upon the promises of god's word cursorily just conveniently i'll try to fit it in i got a pretty busy life don't let that be true lord help us one and all help these fathers and mothers help these teenagers lord we're coming up on a camp i want to see them go into the camp with faith i want to see them go into the camp with the determination to redeem the time and put on the whole armor of god and add to their faith virtue and build up all of these things so that they can take that foundation of faith and set it on their head as a helmet oh god granite today we love you i thank you for your word lord if there be any here today who know father with all heads bowed and even out across the the airwaves please bow your head don't even be looking at your screen right yet you want to raise up your hand to god and say lord you had my number today and i want to pay more attention i'm going to raise up both of mine lord i want to pay more attention to these things i want to be able to operate perfect faith in a time of perfect fear may you grant it to us lord we commit it to you in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord give the lord a hand this morning we're happy happy we love him we thank him we thank him for his word god bless you can be seated we're going to transition to a really special time in our midst here we've got brother jack and uh we're going to give brother jack 10 minutes of dynamite and uh he might blow the building up with it but that'll be okay amen amen praise the lord we don't you know brother dale that was funny this morning uh sound like something brother dale would come up with but you know that's a profound spiritual thought don't just look at this stuff we do on the outside as just you know covering is just religion that's all it is and i don't i don't want just religion i don't want to just have people drive by and go oh what a nice pretty church i want people to walk in and feel drawn to come in and when they come in sinners will fall down and say truly the lord god is among these people hey man brother jack here i go taking up your time brother god bless you amen praise the lord hallelujah amen amen let me get this out of your way this song it should be let me see okay yeah he's on right here okay you're good to go buddy okay god bless y'all i'm uh i'm sister kathy's spokesman she said tell y'all all she appreciates all y'all's prayers all of you sticking together because you'll see when but i read what brother brandon god woke me up early one morning two o'clock and i talked to him until about five o'clock and he said now go in your living room i got something to show you just tell the children of god what their prayers has done for sister kathy not only her but other others too let's go to him in prayer just a minute heavenly father lord jesus i'm nothing god you're everything to me lord you mean oh and all to me lord i'm forsaken everything for you lord me and sister kathy we burn all our bridges lord and i am going on with you lord i'm going upward lord next time my family sees me lord they'll see me standing there with you and the prophet and all of them standing there together lord they'll see that i told them the truth then lord god bless your word lord may go forth lord in jesus christ's name amen anyway he woke me up at two o'clock and i sat there and talked to him and cried because i'll tell you about i thought it was about to lose the precious precious thing to me besides him he's the most precious of my life and that she's next and i tell you what i wasn't going to give her up by reminding god what me and sister kathy had done for him we forsook just about everything for him hauled the tv away 35 years ago and you couldn't give me a million 10 million dollars to put that thing back in my house and i'll tell you i didn't know this until i went back and played the prophet about the token he said you even got to give up in nasty newspapers and i've done that six years ago and i don't care i'm gonna be enough for jesus christ because i'm going upward this is one nut just threaded to jesus christ i don't care what anybody else does i'm going up now we're going to play the prophet let y'all hear what god showed me now along this journey he's promised to supply everything that we have need of whatsoever you will ask the father in my name that will i do whatsoever things mark 11 24 whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it you shall have it now he gave us the strongest weapon that there is in all the world and that's prayer prayer is what changes things the christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before almighty god in the name of jesus christ he doesn't realize what what power that is if the people can only realize that the that what is given right unto them anything that you ask for will be given if you can appropriate the faith to believe it for god's word is true and our god's word will defeat satan anywhere any place any amen it will that will give you all testimony i don't told everybody about the milkman but if i can run into the milkman he's going to hear it too i got it memorized but anyway tuesday kathy got to her lowest i mean and i said babe i got to take you to the merch room you don't want to go but i've got to take you i've done all i can do and she don't even remember me taking it but i placed her in the hands of jesus christ the best hands i could place her in and i left her there and i didn't take her back out of his hands you hear me and uh so i took her there twos and i run back to work and went to work about an hour away and then i come back home that evening i was gonna go in my kayak and just praise the lord and talk to him a little bit and the hospital they said they're trying to call me 10 or 12 times they couldn't get me i believe god blocked all them calls but anyway that evening i went and i called about five o'clock the hospital i said i just want to see how my wife's doing and they said well we tried to call you 10 or 12 times we put her on a helicopter 70 dollar ride for 45 minutes she had an aneurysm in the back of her neck that was about to bust they said it was just like a water hose we talked to him kathy talked to him so it was just like a water hose swelled up real big it was about the bus and about seven months ago she complained about her neck hurt and i prayed for one two three times i said i don't like to keep praying i believe god to take this thing away and she reminded me what brother brandon when he prayed for sister immediate about that tumor he kept they kept praying and believing god and i said that's fine babe and then that the pain just left her never to bother no more but then they flew her to gainesville florida and then uh their doctor was examined that evening tuesday evening before i called her and said yeah you got an aneurysm about the bus and we got to do immediate surgery even weak as she was she didn't even know she didn't even remember me dropping her off at the hospital and uh so then uh i saw i got hold of god that night you hear me he brought me up about two o'clock that night until so early the next morning went to work and me and him talking i had to remind him i said god i need my wife and i remind him what are we done we forsook this and that for you i just remind him brother say he likes you to remind him what you've done for him and i just remind him i said god i said you you brought hezekiah back even if it's my wife's time to go you got to have respect for me and bring my wife back even if the first time to go i said cause i ain't doubting a bit i got faith in you and i know you can do it and i wasn't down a bit and then uh so the next day wednesday i was at work and uh another doctor called me but i talked to kathy she don't remember talking to me tuesday evening i said babe they said they got to do surgery on your aneurysm back your neck because you remember we prayed about that she said yes she don't remember talking to me about that and i said but god's got this you hear me i said i just need you to hold strong for me god will take care of this so wednesday morning the doctor first doctor ever

to keep it rolling brother mark come on buddy and we want to we planned this later on this morning when it to make sure that this would be a go so we're happy to have brother mark amen i want to have hear what the lord did for him amen you want to use this or you want to use this okay all right [Laughter] i want to thank you all really sincerely for all your encouragement and prayers over the last two weeks they've made a world of difference and um for me and my whole family we went through a really low period there but uh god is good he brought us through it and i just want to tell you what happened in the way god miraculously moved for us so every every year about this time we uh go on vacation up into pigeon forge gatlinburg area and we're kind of we get in a rut we we're happy with it you know being from up north being from up north one thing we miss is the leaves and the fall and the colors and all so we go up there every year and uh we enjoy there's a lot to do if you've ever been up there it's a beautiful area and um so that we were going again this year we've been the last four years we missed last year because of the pandemic but uh i fully intended to go again this year and i was online you know booking an airbnb hotel researching what what was the best option for us and i hadn't have thoughts of going anywhere else i had no idea but uh just out of the blue a memory came to me when i was 12 years old back in 1982 my parents took us to colonial williamsburg uh busch gardens and uh i just got to thinking i said i would be nice to go there that's a really pretty area so i went to the family and asked them and they were yeah we're fine with that so go ahead so i went ahead went online booked it bought the tickets and um we started planning the trip well the day we were going to leave i started feeling really really bad i mean worse as bad as i've ever felt in my life but i didn't want to ruin the vacation so i'll just power through it'll get better and um we'll go ahead and make the trip so i um i did and all the way there i was feeling really bad that night we checked into the hotel and it was probably one of the worst nights of my life i felt horrible it's hard to describe how bad it felt so um got up the next morning still feeling bad but we went ahead and went to the park took a trolley ride to the entrance and we made it in the park and we probably were in there probably 150 200 feet and we came to the first ride and it was a really big roller coaster and sarah wanted to ride it she loves those the rest of us not so much but sarah loves them so there was a wood pavilion down there with some picnic tables and i told sarah you go ahead and ride it and we'll wait here for you and uh so the ride took it was a long long line it took about 45 minutes and um so we were sitting there and i just kept feeling worse and worse and by the time sarah came down i told him i said look y'all i don't want to ruin the day um you all go ahead and have a good time i'm gonna go back out to the car and just uh lay down for a while and hope i'll feel better and it's a good thing i didn't as soon as i said that i had a heart attack it was bad everything they say is that's exactly how it is i fell back on the bench where i was laying and it literally felt like a grown man was standing on my chest on one foot and the pain in my arm all the way up into my jaw and i was just drenched from head to foot in sweat and uh i told tammy call 9-1-1 i'm having a heart attack and thankfully she didn't she jumped up and ran to an information booth about 30 feet away and told the lady there i need an ambulance my husband's having a heart attack well by the grace of god there was a fully equipped paramedic team standing 30 feet away right there within two minutes maybe three of me having a heart attack they were there had ekgs on me the paddles and they said yep you're having a heart attack try to relax they started putting nitroglycerin in my mouth the aspirin and it helped immediately i started you know just it relieves something and i was laying there looking at my daughters and you know they were crying but they were praying and i was thinking to myself if they had any natural abilities what more could they do than what the paramedics are doing but they had [Applause] they had a connection to almighty god and tabitha my rock being the trooper she was she was right in there with the paramedics she got a towel she was in her wife in my head wiping my face telling me it was going to be okay so after about 15 minutes i guess a crew showed up from the hospital in an ambulance another another paramedic crew and they quickly switched over took over from that team loaded me on a stretcher and they were able to bring the ambulance right into the park almost to where i was so they loaded me up and um they said real quick we're going to transmit an ekg and then we're going to get going to the hospital which they did and they were very proficient they were very professional calm and um so we started from the hospital and i don't know if anybody's ever fainted or has something like that happen there's always a moment of where you're fading out and you're fading back in when your heart stops that doesn't happen it's like somebody just cuts the film it's like you're gone instantly because i was sitting there looking at them and then instantly the scene changed and they were saying to me uh hang in there mark hang in there we're almost there hang with us you'll be all right we're almost to the hospital and i said what's going on i had no recollection of anything and they told me your heart stopped and you were going for about two minutes we had to shock you twice to bring you back and the enormity of what i was in the middle of hitting me and i i was just overcome they had my right left arm you know strapped down with the cuff and the iv but i just i couldn't even pray i just i just reached my arm up towards the roof of that ambulance reaching out to god lord help me and and the paramedic was like what's wrong what are you doing i was like i'm just praying he was like well that's a good thing to do right now so so they they got me to the hospital they quickly unloaded me and rushed me in they took me into this big room bigger than what you would normally see in an emergency room and there was about 10 or 12 people waiting there for me so they quickly started working and they said we need to get an x-ray of your chest so they brought in this machine took an x-ray and uh it happened again my heart stopped again and um this time i came to myself hollering to the top of my lungs from the pain of the defibrillator and i once again what's going on they said your heart stopped again we had to do cpr and we had to shock you again to get your back and um so i you know i i'm not going to kid you i was scared i was really scared it's a you can't know what that feels like till you're in the middle of it knowing how close you are to leaving this mortal coil so anyway they quickly rushed me down a hall and into an operating room and uh it sedated me i was awake the whole time but they tried to go into my arm to do they couldn't get in so they went through my leg and they went in and the doctor said there was a 99 blockage in the circumplex artery which is covers the left side of your heart and feeds it so he said i'm gonna go ahead and take care of that you've got another blockage in the lat artery but it's too complicated for me to do right here so i'm gonna get you stable and then i want you to either we're gonna send you to our heart hospital or i'm gonna let you go home and you get it taken care of as soon as you can so i was like all right so they did that they released me i recovered quickly they said i was fine two days later they released me so wednesday morning we were going to head home and i was sitting in the lobby of the hotel there i just ate a yogurt i wasn't hungry but needed something and that feeling came back again as i was sitting there it wasn't as bad but i started sweating i was drenched in sweat so i laid down on the bench i told have you got to call 9-1-1 and i really believe that the enemy wanted me to make that trip home without having that taken care of because it turns out it was a bit worse than what that first doctor thought it was so they took me back and then um so that first cardiologist came in and said look i'm just gonna send you down to our um heart hospital in norfolk and we're gonna go ahead and get this taken care of while you're here which i was very happy to hear and um so they did they went in and i ended up getting a total of seven stents four in that circumflex artery and three in the lead artery and he told me while he was doing he said the blockage in your lat artery was substantially more than what that first doctor thought so it was a good thing you came here and uh i was laying there in that hospital room that night looking at the ceiling thinking about it all and the gun just he revealed something to me he said maybe this is just for me but he brought that memory to my mind that about that trip we made when i was a little boy so that i could be where i needed to be when that happened brother andrew cobb sent me a message of encouragement told me he was praying for me but he said in his opinion which is extensive he works in an emergency room he would know if anybody does he told me brother mark i'm just going to tell you that if this had happened to you at home or probably anywhere else you would not have made it there's no way first responders could have got to you in time you would have died then uh brother caleb campbell told me um afterwards in a chat he said that uh the last two years with hardieville fire department he's been on literally dozens of heart attack calls and in every one where cpr was initiated one person has made it one i'm a walking breathing miracle and i just want to give god wow god is good isn't he my goodness you know why should i worry why should i fear the very same jesus walking right here hallelujah amen we've got another one that we want to give god all the glory i'm going to ask brother jason to come we're going to set a chair out because he probably isn't strong enough to stand the whole time and so he'll stand as he can and seats be seated as is needed amen so god bless you brother god bless you we'll just keep this one on [Music] god bless you all on at about 2 a.m on wednesday i couldn't get my breath and brother travis came and picked me up and brought me to beaufort memorial and um i i got in and they did all kinds of tests and so i had double covered pneumonia was in the er they brought me up to the pcu and started treating me and that was and then into thursday my mind began to slip away into delirium and didn't really know what was going on and with that i will turn it over to amy to talk thank you well pray for me um so i had been able to be in touch with him by text through the week and i was not worried i just i had faith but came to um friday night late i'd been in touch with him through friday evening and then it just stopped and it was about midnight and i couldn't go to sleep i just i had the feeling something was wrong and that whole night i couldn't sleep i woke up kept checking my phone there was just nothing and i was finally able to get a hold of his doctor saturday morning learned that he was he was really struggling with anxiety and i know him and he couldn't sleep and i know that that was an attack from the devil and so um i woke up i was i was a mess on saturday i just really was amber had texted me and asked if she needed me to come sit with her and just right away said yes i'd lord told me that i was going to need somebody that day she came over and sat with me and i just waited and waited and waited and finally i think it was about 4 30 and she's like just call so i called up i got a hold of the nurse and she had been in the room with him and i could hear the exhaustion in her voice and she gave me that update that he was delirious he didn't know who i was who the girls were where he was what his job was and they said they've got him down and see teaser this isn't normal with kovid we're working really hard to try and find out what's going on i hung up the phone and i just fell apart and as soon as i could get myself together i told amber we got text messages out to everybody i could think of to pray and the lord really spoke to me through two people brother don gurgle texted me back right away and he said don't worry about that sister amy that's just the devil trying to scare you and amber had been sitting there praying with me and she said amy and god's telling me one thing that's it you have to choose to believe him you have to choose to believe that he's going to be okay and through those two people the lord calmed in my spirit and we just kept praying there was still something that wasn't settled in me though i believed but the lord still had something to do for me and it's you preached on perfect faith that was what god used to speak to me and he spoke to me in just an amazing way sunday my niece flew in to help us and i had to go pick her up at the airport in hilton head and i was on the way there i was driving and also and i get a text from him and this is the first text that i've gotten since um friday night and it was letters he couldn't his mind was still not there it was letters and one word and i just started crying because i said lord thank you he's trying at least he's got enough thought to try and the only thing that was pressed on me to try and somehow activate his faith so to get him looking to the lord because i knew with that delirium that he couldn't so i started texting him and i started sending him just asking jason do you believe do you believe and he couldn't answer me and i was like if i can just get him to respond yes that's all i need and that i will that morning um i had we had streamed our church in minnesota and there was a guest minister who was reading from perfect faith and he read this quote and it was what the lord grabbed to start and it's this first one and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word and that just reached out and grabbed me and the lord started to work so when i got in the car to go to pick up my niece i put on perfect faith and we listened to it the whole way there i got to a store to run an errand and i was just sitting in the car and he texted me one word and it was miracle and it was followed by another word need and that was when i was impressed lord i gotta get his faith on you i gotta get him to somehow if he can't see anything else to see you and he couldn't respond to me he couldn't respond to me couldn't respond to me so we kept driving and um i was just i was kind of wrestling this out with the lord and we were bluffed in and it was impressed in my heart that i needed some time by myself with god and so the girls were hungry and we i pulled into a chipotle and i didn't even have to say a word my niece piped up and she said hey why don't i take the girls in for you and you can just have some time and i said that's exactly what i need thank you so she took the girls in and brother branham came on on this next quote in perfect faith and spoke to my heart and said if he can lift me up with a faith this way even for the people even if they can't climb to that bracket if he can't they can't do it he can use my faith he can lift me up to that place and i'm climbing for you i'm believing for you i'm speaking for you i'm your brother standing as you standing as your brother and intercessor trying my best to hold you before god and i'm standing here right before the white throne now and staking that pointing my finger to that bloody sacrifice there and speaking through his name that it's done it has to happen it has to happen you know what's happened and i know it's happened so do you know that it's happened and right there i said lord it's okay if he can't believe because i can i can do it and the very next thing that came up and this is why we're all here today he says when you get back here next sunday you give the testimony of how you are healed and what happened this week watch and see what happened it's over and i just sat in my car in the parking lot and just worshiped lord i had my hands in the air and i was bawling and then at the very two minutes to the end of perfect faith and brother branham is about to close and there's this tongues and an interpretation afterward and we know that god isn't limited by time and space and all he can tell you is 58 years ago god spoke to me for him because i heard this interpretation and it was god's voice to me and i'm going to try to get through it is not my word real in the hearts of those in whom i will reveal it saith the lord thy god yea and is not my word sharp even as i have spoken this night yea sharper than a two-edged sword yeah i say unto thee my arm is not shortened that i cannot heal and yea my heart is not dull that i cannot hear thy prayer see us lord thy god yay look into me and know that yes that shall be performed which i have promised unto thee saith the lord thy god ye know ye that the truth was broken unto you this night yea that the miracle that i have promised the yea are already taking place yea they are coming to pass saith the lord thy god know ye and let this word be confirmed in thy heart that i have dealt with thee and will be with you saith the lord and i sat and just left and praised the lord because from that point on it was finished i had no doubt not as i took a note from sister rachel and i pray i had to transcribe that because it wasn't transcribed in the book i printed it off and it is plastered all over my house so that everywhere i could see and i could point to that promise that was mine and there was nothing that could cause me to doubt it after that i i he took it over and then i came home and i knew there was some point in there that um brother branham had talked about the prayer cloth and it was right here and said also with my hands upon these handkerchiefs laying here i've been watching it close and i'm believing that they'll produce just exactly what the people requested i believe it and i called i think i texted sister emily and just said can i get you guys a prayer cloth for andrew to bring him and she said absolutely i came and brought it to her and she said you know what yeah andrew and i are going to pray over it that brother branham had a great tradeoff it was one of brother brandon's class and she said um andrew and i are going to pray over it before he brings it up and i saw that too and i texted her that it'll happen just exactly what the people requested so for me this was settled last sunday but there was a huge work that the lord how he did it was up to him and jason and he did something just unbelievable through jason then satan brought a perfectly coordinated terrorist strike against every weakness he wanted to manipulate in me something that he this this was like a a demonic plan that was put together i don't know over a decade with pieces of the puzzle that he had worked on slowly in my life to create weaknesses to create complexes to create difficult uh ways of of handling things in order to bring it to this point to take me i went i went into that hospital and before i went into the hospital there was a very heavy darkness over me my faith was almost gone i was at the weakest point i i don't see brother andrew and i'm really glad that i don't see him because i think i would fall fall to pieces i see his brother there so that's just a little help but um brother andrew is god's softest handed angel i god used him to bring light i was in a dark tunnel i did not know what was happening that there was i could sense the presences presence of p nurses and i know that i know that everyone was trying to help everyone was trying to assist me so when you hear me talk i'm not trying to say that the nurses were devils or anything like that i understand they were trying to help but this was a personal torment created by satan as a terrorist strike against me there was a doctor that was just like a when he came in the room it was just like a tool it seemed like i couldn't understand what um i couldn't i could i couldn't connect to him i couldn't understand what was what he how he was communicating i don't want to dwell on that but what i'm trying to say is there was a nurse very soft presence trying to help there's another nurse this is just in delirium very harsh hard presence i was they had to restrain me they had to put white like gloves that were instead of putting the straight jacket on people they put these things on and i was i was burning and ripping them off and i was screaming for my wife and my family and i was just totally totally delirious and when all this is happening i think we're done with the powerpoint brothers it's all right when this was happening uh different times brother andrew would it it was there was a light that came into the room and i could come to myself and i was andrew andrew and i don't know much of what transpired until sunday night when he brought the prayer cloth on sunday night when he brought the prayer cloth the i did not yet come in contact with the promise but the promise came in contact with me through the prayer cloth and brother andrew praying over me and i went from being delirious and uncooperative to being cooperative and coming into my right mind however i was heavily heavily sedated during all this my personality i'm i'm very independent and i don't there's i don't want to be helped with lots of different things so this is this is it was just i don't want to go into too many details it's hospital stuff but there was many things that i feared over my lifetime that have came upon me during this time i was extreme they had to keep me dry because of my lungs covered pneumonia i was extremely dry they they it felt like they sent person after person to use needles to chew on my arms i'm just bruised all up and down my arms because they couldn't get couldn't draw blood these are all things were happening now after i remember from sunday night on i'm still not i'm still not in contact with god yet god's in contact with me through my because my wife and and all the saints around the world praying brought me and opened the roof and lowered me to jesus but especially my wife did that but um on monday and into tuesday i kind of don't remember anything tuesday i start coming back and the strangest thing is god was going to use anything to get back in contact with me and someone said why don't you turn the tv on and watch something and so i turned the tv on and i started dialing around i was looking for a cooking show to watch or news or weather or something and it came and it stopped i stopped somehow on a spider-man show and but it's funny but you have to understand this this was god going to talk to me in a very strange way spider spiderman was being directly attacked to be destroyed and this mysterio person was using a.i to deceive his eyes he put him in another dimension and he was trying to destroy the character and he was trying to destroy the life of spider-man and he almost did but then spider-man came came back and he he realized he had to see he had to remember what was real and then he could fight mysterio and defeat him i'm just watching this i'm like what am i watching this for and that and and then all of the all of it and it was finished and the it was over with and i was still quite delirious and then the the next day it just struck me as a revelation you have to get come back to what is real and see what is real so that you can fight in the afternoon on wednesday amy sent me a text because she had already sent me all this information and i did not connect with it at all by by text and so i am in it's in the afternoon on wednesday she sends psalm 34 has been rolling through my mind a lot and that struck an accord i was coming to enough that i saw this poor man cried and the lord heard him and delivered him from his enemies and that just rolled and rolled and rolled in my mind so i pulled up shane and shane on youtube and listened to it and then um the next song that came up is the one that sister is gonna sing for us here soon i was thinking of the goodness of god and god started showing me speaking to me the purpose behind all of all of this happening that satan meant it for evil but god means it for good and that god has a purpose in all of it and that through suffering god that through this suffering god is going to be glorified and all of a sudden the picture of my father and how he would handle situations in his life came and came in front of me and i said to myself i am going home i am healed and i am going home and i i um all of this they're they're still working on my arms i'm still basically tethered to the bed because they're worried about blood blood clots and you so you can't hardly move your legs you can't hardly move your body i i'm in my own personal torment at the time with no freedom no ability to get out of the bed and not nothing and so so weak and pain everywhere and um the the doctors are even coming in and saying are you are you an alcoholic because they're looking at my numbers in my liver and saying you must be an alcoholic and i i can't tell you how many times they asked do i drink do you drink do you drink do you drink do you drink do you drink do you drink do you drink and um let me slow myself down so the doctor came to talk to me on wednesday that's one of the things that he talked to me about but he saw that my covet was getting better and he said we're gonna we we if you start if you keep improving we're gonna move you from icu to pcu i'm so delirious i don't even know what in the world that means it must be a good thing i guess so then i i improved so much on wednesday they did they moved me through wednesday i was still really struggling about how to put sentences together um how to talk amy has um voice texts for me that are just probably are so ridiculous that i don't know you know i would say a word and then 5 seconds 10 15 seconds later i would say another word but it wouldn't be the right word and so that's just how everything was going but i think it was that day that andrew came and i asked him about the wedding and he almost fell over um he was so shocked that i was had come too he said told amy i was a brand i was a new new man but i think i'm i'm fuzzy here but i i think the doctor did come to speak to me or that or the nurse told me about moving to pcu perhaps on um on wednesday night and they they actually ended up late wednesday night moving me to pcu and that's when really the spiritual a new form of spiritual warfare started happening when i moved to that other room is it's strange but it was a it was a full moon and when i was in that room um the hospital was like an explosion it was so crazy i i would call and people i wouldn't get help it would take hours for the um the nurses to come and help me sometimes with different things that i needed help with it was very difficult they or because of the elevated liver numbers they ordered a uh ultrasound and it was it was like someone was taking a knife and rubbing it all around my body it hurt so bad and it which made me so scared the devil said see you got cancer you got cancer in your liver and it was just it was i was terrified i didn't know what was happening and the doctor was so busy because every time a nurse said you got to go talk to him you've got to go talk to him he couldn't he couldn't get there he got called to another emergency well throughout the day i'm saying i'm i'm going home tomorrow i'm going home i'm going home tomorrow i'm done i need to heal at home with my family and so on about about five o'clock i decided i'm going to stand up and walk around the room so i stood up and i started walking around the room because that was one of the things they said you're gonna have to have to walk for six minutes before we let you go so i stood up and walked up and around the room for 15 minutes sat down five minutes later the doctor came in he's he started talking to me and i said i'm go i need to go home and he kind of was had a smirk on his face like probably monday he'll go home and i i said no i want to go home tonight or tomorrow and he said well tell me about your your day so he started talking about the alcohol again and then he started asking about my lungs and he said what's that thing that i there's a spirometer that's like a it tests and also helps you with breathing but no one can find it and i didn't have it so i was just doing my own uh lung exercises throughout the day and he came and gave it to me and he was hit he his eyes got big and said you what your lungs are really strong right now really strong so he said we started talking and i was just i my my dad could convince people so easily of what he wanted he just asked for it he said just ask for it that's what i i texted my dad what do i say to this doctor he says just ask tell him you need to go home and recover with your family she said i told him i need to go home and recover with my family i'm good enough to do that now he's he said and he looked at my breathing and he said i will order a six minute walking test tomorrow and if you pass it you'll go home and i was so happy but there was still spiritual battles going on i um that that evening i've i finally fell asleep with a deep sleep from 9 30 to about 12 30 but god woke me up 12 30 and told me to started speaking to me he told me take off your oxygen and stand up so i took off my oxygen but i thought why do i need to stand up so then it was just a spiritual battle taking place and i took off my oxygen and i was just talking to the lord and he was he was giving me songs and he was he was encouraging my faith and throughout this throughout this time i just had my oxygen up i think i texted a few different people in the middle of the night a selfie with my oxygen off said i'm going home um and so they um about it was through the night 12 between 12 30 and 4 30 that i was awake worshiping and praising the lord and thanking him for my healing and with all the time with my oxygen off and i kept looking at my numbers and that oxygen levels kept staying between 92 and 95 my heart rate's elevated because it's that that all that stills figuring itself out but the the oxygen saturation levels were just fine no no problem so then finally i stood up i felt so strong when i stood up i didn't feel that weight weakness or dizziness or anything and i was just like rejoicing so i sat down and you know through all of this there's so many different things that happened in the middle of the night a brother from israel sent an offering to me that was such the perfect amount that we needed that it was absolutely incredible and i said god what are you doing this is this is amazing i know i'm going home and so but all the time battling you better put that oxygen on your your your number's going down it went down to 92. you better get it up again and so i i put it on for a little bit no you got to take that keep that off what are you doing keep that off so all this time this is happening all of a sudden a vision happened and this little demonic had uh like like it looked like just a sith it started just the head walked into the room and it said the dark lord has demanded you and i i immediately fear seized me and i said i said lord take your mighty hand and and destroy the enemy and i i saw a hand with with a light at the end of it come and struck down and it was like a and the the enemy left and i said lord cover this room with your angelic light and i didn't see any light but the presence of the lord was there dro driving back the enemy the enemy spoke again i said this room is covered by the blood of jesus christ i am covered by the blood of jesus christ and i am going home a sweet peace came over me over the room and i went to sleep the story is not finished yet i went to sleep not long after that i was awoken by someone in my room worshiping and praising god a faithful gullah sister was in my room a nurse and she said oh sweet jesus hallelujah praise the lord god sent me to this room i knew i was going to come and speak to someone today and i i woke up and i felt a spiritual warfare taking place i said what is happening who is in my room i thought there was an angel in my room i was still coming to finally i realized it was a gullah woman and she was worshiping she was praising she was she said you're healed you took your oxygen off i said i took my oxygen off i am healed hallelujah and she said i see you took it off hallelujah jesus healed you he i don't know who you are i don't know what purpose god has for you but he has healed you he is sending you home today when you get home you listen to god because he has something for you to do but you wait on him and you listen to him only now earlier in the night the lord told when he when the lord was waking me up he said drink your healing and breathe me in and breathe me out so i was just drinking water i drink water drink water i called the nurse i dr i probably drink they have those big things of water with ice in them i probably drank four or five of those and i did i felt as i was growing in strength as i was getting more of those i think at 3 30 a woman came to take my blood she came in and was out in a minute and a half so fast before they couldn't even get my blood but because the lord was telling me to drink water it was it was easy no problem so through all of this this lady comes in can you imagine this lady comes into the room and just starts worshiping and praising and it it was like it i don't know if any of you have read or heard this present darkness or piercing the darkness but god satan had a a perfect strike planned against me to take me out and god was a hundred steps ahead of him the whole time and hidden he was hidden from satan's view most of that time and at the very end he chose a little gull of woman from ridgeland south carolina as the final blow against the enemy that woman that woman which when i called and said so then i didn't finish the story so then in the morning after that woman came she encouraged me spoke to spoke to me the respiratory nurse came and said um well you're looking they're looking good stand up and start marching and i just said start march why would she even use that terminology so i stood up i had no oxygen on she's like why don't you have your oxygen on i said i don't need it wow i said yes praise the lord she said yes praise the lord god has strange purposes but he works so i stood up and started marching and she's just like this look at your numbers they're not even changing and of course my heart rate was like 140 but my oxygen level stayed the same the whole time she's like okay you can stop put you put your hands up and down then my oxygen numbers went higher and she said all right you're going home praise the lord and so then the doctor came and the the doctor came and spoke to me and he was he was amazed at the turn around everyone was amazed at the turnaround then they they got me i was able to get dressed and that one i called and said my um my ride is here that do you know that gullah woman i it was like somebody was beaten down the hallway to get a uh a wheelchair and she came and brought me out to my family what a mighty god we serve [Music] [Applause] anyone that is struggling anyone that is sick anyone that's listening in that has someone in your family that's sick believe god he's a mountain moving god amen he has an eternal purpose for your life and i want the last thing that i want to say is if anyone says that this is not a family does not know what they're talking about this people took time out of their schedule they dropped everything to help us they came in the middle of the night they answered calls in the middle of the night andrew while he's preparing for his family's wedding even when he wasn't supposed to be

couldn't get to anyone and that i couldn't be more proud i couldn't be more proud you are a family amen amen i i i've always thought of a church should be like that and you've been very faithful to that so turn around and wave at your family say god bless your family amen i want to give a uh a personal word of gratitude to brother andrew who was just uh [Music] angel of mercy when no one could go in i couldn't go in i wouldn't no credentials i had could get me in there but brother andrew could be in there and he was you know he's going back and forth to the room he's he's sending me pictures and encouraging me and and and you know and as best as he could with legal requirements as best as he was able keeping me in the loop and the family in the loop and i just said brother andrew you've been a godsend i said you were an angel you just i don't know how to describe it and i just so appreciate the gift that god has used in his life many of us here at bethel tabernacle we've been at that er many times and it was such a comfort to see brother andrew come in you almost just feel like okay everything will be fine now amen amen and so i just appreciate all the saints of god i
