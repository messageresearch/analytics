[0:42] [Music]
[0:58] good morning everyone god bless you
[1:00] thank you so much for being here and for
[1:04] those who are tuning in we just
[1:06] appreciate that and pray the Lord richly
[1:09] blesses you this is our Sunday school if
[1:11] we want to those who are here stand up
[1:13] and we're gonna pray it can stand up at
[1:18] home too if you want to father we just
[1:21] come to your Lord and we we love you
[1:24] we're so thankful that your grace is
[1:27] ever abounding to us Lord
[1:28] we're always daily in a position where
[1:32] we have desperate need of you Lord to to
[1:36] cleanse our hearts to forgive our sins
[1:39] Lord to uphold us Lord and you uphold
[1:44] all things by the word of your power and
[1:47] we're so thankful that we're part of
[1:48] that all things Lord we ask that your
[1:51] spirit would be present with us Lord
[1:53] that you would take these things that
[1:55] are spoken and quicken them to our
[1:56] hearts father we commit ourselves to you
[1:58] in Jesus name Amen
[2:00] god bless you can be seated so I'm going
[2:06] to continue on mystery of the Godhead
[2:08] part 8 and I I came across some
[2:13] interesting things and in my studies
[2:15] today and sometimes what comes up is
[2:19] there's a confusion about the word
[2:22] person when we're talking about three
[2:24] persons versus one person and of course
[2:29] God is obviously one person he's not
[2:35] three persons but I came across this I
[2:38] hope you can read that there's a there's
[2:42] a man I think he's on the radio often
[2:45] here even he's a he's a preacher and a
[2:47] theologian from Ireland named Alister
[2:49] McGrath and by everybody's estimation
[2:53] he's very much quote/unquote Orthodox
[2:56] Trinitarian but I want you to listen to
[2:59] how he describes this the word persons
[3:03] and it this is actually shocking to me
[3:06] the way he describes it because it's
[3:07] pretty much what we're what brother
[3:10] branham taught us so he says the word
[3:15] person has changed its meaning since the
[3:18] third century when it began to be used
[3:20] in connection with the threefold nests
[3:22] of God when we talk about God as a
[3:26] person we naturally think of God as
[3:28] being one person but theologians such as
[3:31] Tertullian writing in the third century
[3:33] used the word person with a different
[3:35] meaning the word person originally
[3:37] derives from the Latin word persona
[3:40] meaning an actor's face or mask and by
[3:43] extension the role which he played so
[3:47] that was the original meaning of the
[3:49] word person when they first put it in
[3:52] place so then we go he goes on and he
[3:55] says by stating that there were three
[3:57] persons but only one God
[3:59] Tertullian was asserting that all three
[4:01] major roles in the great drama of human
[4:04] Redemption are played by the one and the
[4:07] same God the three great roles in this
[4:10] drama are all played by the same actor
[4:12] Wow
[4:15] God each of these roles may reveal God
[4:19] in a somewhat different way but it is
[4:21] the same God in every case so when we
[4:24] talk about God as one person we mean one
[4:27] person in the modern sense of the word
[4:29] and we talk about God as three persons
[4:32] we mean three persons in the ancient
[4:33] sense of the word confusing these two
[4:37] senses of the word person inevitably
[4:39] leads to the idea that God is an actual
[4:42] actually a committee Wow
[4:47] so this is what an Orthodox Trinitarian
[4:51] is describing he's saying God is not a
[4:54] committee of three separate and distinct
[4:57] persons in the modern sense that we
[4:59] understand persons he's telling us
[5:01] that's a that's an error to understand
[5:04] it that way but nevertheless this is
[5:07] what Trinitarians understand it as two
[5:10] throughout history and it's a it's an
[5:13] error
[5:14] it's a it's a
[5:15] very terrible theological error there's
[5:19] one God he's one person but he reveals
[5:22] himself through three different masks
[5:26] that's what Alister McGrath is saying
[5:29] his understanding of the Trinity is it's
[5:33] not wrong it's not wrong I was just
[5:36] blown away when I read that with that
[5:40] said I want to start going in looking a
[5:43] little bit we talked about the
[5:44] difference between the Greek
[5:46] philosophical way of looking at the
[5:48] Godhead and the Jewish understanding of
[5:52] the Godhead and so I'm gonna start
[5:55] looking at some some of the ways the
[5:56] Jews understand who God is this is
[6:01] actually taken from a catechism for
[6:03] Jewish children it says I believe with a
[6:06] firm faith that there exists a Creator
[6:07] who blessed be his name has created and
[6:10] governs all his creatures and that he
[6:13] alone has made does make and will make
[6:15] all things that can by any possibility
[6:23] that that by any possibility have
[6:26] existence I believe with the firm faith
[6:28] that the Creator is one and there's no
[6:31] unity like him in any manner and that he
[6:34] alone is our God who was who is and who
[6:37] will be I believe with the firm faith
[6:40] that the blessed Creator is in corporal
[6:42] that no bodily infirmities or accidents
[6:45] can reach him and that he can be
[6:47] compared to nothing corporal of which we
[6:49] can form any idea I believe with the
[6:52] firm faith that the blessed creator is
[6:54] the first and the last I believe with a
[6:56] firm faith that the blessed creator is
[6:58] the only one to whom we should pray and
[7:00] there's besides him no being to whom we
[7:04] ought to address our prayers and so this
[7:08] is the Jewish understanding now they
[7:10] they take it and they bring it so far to
[7:13] the point where they don't believe that
[7:15] God could appear in human flesh but they
[7:18] contradict their very own scriptures
[7:19] which they claim to believe they claim
[7:24] to believe that God appeared to Abraham
[7:25] in any eighth
[7:29] which and drank milk they believe that
[7:32] God appeared in the form of Melchizedek
[7:36] to Abraham so God can take on a human
[7:40] form
[7:41] absolutely but even more than that is
[7:44] that God made his sons and daughters in
[7:48] his very image and likeness and so God's
[7:50] actually God's purpose was to reveal
[7:52] himself in human form and so in these
[7:55] things they've gotten off the track and
[7:57] they've taken it too far but with that
[8:00] said this is a this is a true and right
[8:03] understanding God is a spirit he's he's
[8:06] not limited by only a hue only a human
[8:10] body or a spiritual but even just a
[8:11] spiritual body he's beyond that but yet
[8:14] he's taken the form of the logos stick
[8:17] in the form of the pillar of fire he's
[8:18] taken the form of Melchizedek all these
[8:21] different things he's appeared at and he
[8:23] took the form of Jesus Christ now he's
[8:26] taking the form of the body of Christ
[8:29] the Bride of Christ so Jewish belief is
[8:33] that God is one God is an undivided
[8:35] unity the creed that the Jews believe in
[8:38] is Deuteronomy 6 verse 4 here o Israel
[8:40] the Lord our God is one Lord Jesus and
[8:47] Paul both reaffirm this simple
[8:50] confession mark 12 28 and 29 and one of
[8:55] the scribes came and having heard them
[8:57] reasoning and perceiving that he had
[9:00] answered them well asked him which is
[9:02] the first commandment of all and jesus
[9:05] answered him the first of all
[9:07] commandments is hear o Israel the Lord
[9:09] our God is one Lord so he reaffirms that
[9:13] very simple basic commandment and Paul
[9:17] and Galatians 3:27 a mediator is not a
[9:20] mediator of one but God is one and we
[9:24] read the other translation the amplified
[9:26] for that and says but God is one person
[9:29] so Jesus Paul all the apostles never
[9:35] changed to belief in three distinct
[9:37] persons but here is the concept that
[9:41] comes to us
[9:43] on the left side there is the Trinity
[9:46] that's the concept that we get in
[9:49] artwork and so there's three separate
[9:52] and distinct persons and they're one
[9:55] because they're made up of the same
[9:57] substance so this is nothing less than
[10:00] belief in three gods if this is their
[10:04] understanding of the Trinity now as we
[10:06] read Alistair McAllister McGrath his his
[10:09] thought on the Trinity and I think many
[10:12] people of today's day and age is
[10:14] different than this concept of the
[10:17] Trinity of three separate and distinct
[10:19] persons that are as a committee in
[10:22] fellowship for all eternity the biblical
[10:25] truth we see on the right this is the
[10:29] picture that God gives of himself in his
[10:32] heavenly court there's one throne in
[10:38] heaven for one God Isaiah 6 verse 1 in
[10:42] the year that King Uzziah died I saw
[10:45] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[10:48] and lifted up in his train filled the
[10:51] temple how many did he see he saw the
[10:55] Lord sitting upon how many Thrones a
[10:58] throne he didn't see three three thrones
[11:02] he didn't see two thrones he saw one
[11:05] throne ezekiel 1:26 and above the
[11:11] firmament that was over their heads was
[11:12] the likeness of a throne and as the as
[11:16] the appearance excuse me an above the
[11:19] firmament that was over their heads was
[11:21] the likeness of a throne how many
[11:24] Thrones a throne one throne as the
[11:28] appearance of a sapphire stone and upon
[11:30] the likeness of the throne the throne
[11:32] not the Thrones was the likeness of the
[11:35] appearance of a man above upon it so
[11:40] this is what God pictures himself as you
[11:43] say well that's just the Old Testament
[11:44] that was just for the Jews alright well
[11:46] let's go to the New Testament revelation
[11:48] 4 2 through 4 and immediately I was in
[11:51] the spirit and behold Thrones were set
[11:54] in heaven now
[11:56] a throne was set in heaven how many sat
[11:59] on the throne and one sat on the throne
[12:03] so the New Testament reveals it in even
[12:05] greater detail it says specifically uses
[12:08] the word one
[12:09] how many is one is it two three ten
[12:15] thousand this one and he he that sat was
[12:19] to look upon like a Jasper and a sardine
[12:21] stone and there was a rainbow round
[12:23] about the throne in sight like unto an
[12:25] emerald and round about the throne were
[12:27] four and 20 seats and upon the seats I
[12:31] saw four and twenty elders sitting
[12:33] clothed in white raiment and they had on
[12:35] their heads crowns of gold so there we
[12:39] see the picture and you say well Jesus
[12:42] was a in a little throne sitting next to
[12:45] the right hand of God
[12:48] revelation three says I overcame Jesus
[12:51] and I overcame and him sit down in my
[12:54] Father's throne
[12:55] so what throne is Jesus sitting on
[12:58] there's no picture of a little throne
[13:00] sitting next to to God's throne there's
[13:04] not two persons there there's one person
[13:08] there's one that's sitting upon the
[13:09] throne that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:12] so just gonna go through some important
[13:16] verses about the oneness of God
[13:18] 1st Timothy 6 16 who only so only means
[13:23] alone it means by definition there's
[13:27] just one person this is verses talking
[13:30] about it's not talking about two persons
[13:32] three persons who alone has immortality
[13:37] dwelling in the light which no man can
[13:39] approach unto whom no man hath seen nor
[13:43] can see to whom be honor and power
[13:47] everlasting amen
[13:50] 1st Timothy 2 verse 5 for there is one
[13:53] God and one mediator between God and men
[13:58] the man Christ Jesus isaiah 44:24 thus
[14:06] saith the lord thy Redeemer and he that
[14:09] only from the womb I am the Lord that
[14:12] maketh all things that stretches forth
[14:14] the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad
[14:16] the earth by myself now I don't know how
[14:20] much clearer that can get that this is
[14:22] speaking about one person but you say it
[14:25] says let us make man in our own image
[14:27] okay so then you explain this verse come
[14:32] here and explain the verse he says let
[14:34] us make man in our own image but then
[14:36] the neck very next verse it says in the
[14:38] image of God made he him male and female
[14:41] made he them so one verse it says us the
[14:45] next verse immediately it's back to
[14:47] singular personal pronoun and then we
[14:49] hear that God says he did it alone God
[14:54] Himself did it so what does God do we
[14:57] you witness it through the through the
[14:59] scriptures he says let us he says who
[15:02] will go for us it's it's clear there's
[15:05] one person sitting on one throne and he
[15:09] has he's a singular personal pronoun one
[15:12] person not three isaiah 43:10 and 11 you
[15:18] are my witnesses saith the lord and my
[15:20] sermon who servant whom i have chosen
[15:23] that you may know and believe me and
[15:25] understand that I am he before me there
[15:28] was no God formed neither shall there be
[15:31] after me I even I am the Lord and
[15:35] besides me there is no Savior there's
[15:38] one god there's one Savior now I want
[15:40] you to notice what he said he said I am
[15:43] he when he when he met Moses he said I
[15:47] am that I am now Jesus was speaking
[15:51] understand he was a man he had to get a
[15:53] beginning and in time but who was
[15:56] speaking there when he when they were
[15:59] saying you you're a man you know you're
[16:01] not even older than 50 years old and you
[16:04] say you've seen Abraham what did he say
[16:08] before Abraham was I am
[16:11] he was completely identifying himself as
[16:15] the the Living God of Israel right in
[16:19] front of them they said you ever met you
[16:21] they were focusing on
[16:23] is manhood and Jesus trying to see who
[16:26] is on display here before Abraham was I
[16:30] am and that's the same thing in
[16:32] vindication when God is vindicating
[16:34] himself that son of man ministry
[16:38] revealing the presence of God who is
[16:40] here the I am he is revealing himself
[16:44] he's manifesting himself what is the
[16:46] sign of the Messiah doing it's showing
[16:49] the I am is present it's the unveiling
[16:52] of the invisible God whom no man has
[16:55] seen nor can see and yet we've seen him
[17:00] we beheld him no not in and of himself
[17:04] no one can but in his manifestation you
[17:07] see him John 4:24
[17:11] God is a spirit and they that worship
[17:15] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[17:19] truth I love this verse I often forget
[17:24] the context he was speaking to a woman
[17:28] who was an unclean woman that based upon
[17:31] his culture each never should have been
[17:33] speaking to her and the apart the
[17:36] disciples came back and they were
[17:37] shocked they were so he was speaking to
[17:39] her but what did what was he doing this
[17:42] was a Samaritan what was he showing this
[17:46] is what God this is the kind of worship
[17:48] that God wants don't worry about temples
[17:51] don't worry about coming to this
[17:52] mountain for the Samaritans the father
[17:56] seeks these kind of worshipers the ones
[17:58] that worship Him in spirit and in truth
[17:59] why why does he do that because God is a
[18:03] spirit he's not an idol that lives in a
[18:06] temple he's not limited to one little
[18:09] space wherever you are whether you're in
[18:13] a church or in your home in the mountain
[18:17] at your job you can worship God in
[18:21] spirit and in truth isn't that beautiful
[18:26] God is a spirit God is not a man
[18:29] God is not a human being God is an
[18:33] eternal spirit he never had a beginning
[18:35] never had an ending
[18:37] he covers all space and time the Bible
[18:41] says the heaven and the heaven of
[18:43] heavens cannot contain him now he
[18:46] brother Branham says he's not like the
[18:48] air we understand that that's absolutely
[18:51] true he's he's greater than everything
[18:54] the heaven in the heavens of can't
[18:56] contain him he also brother Branham also
[18:58] says he covers all space and time so in
[19:00] what sense is he not just like the air
[19:02] because he lives in a body he has an
[19:06] expression he has a manifestation that's
[19:08] the logos when God wanted to reveal
[19:10] himself out of God went the logos and
[19:13] that became the body the theophany of
[19:16] God the expression of who God is but yet
[19:20] God is still a spirit he's not limited
[19:22] just by one spiritual body brother
[19:29] Branham says he's not Jesus only and the
[19:32] Jesus only doctrine he says it's wrong
[19:35] Feast of the trumpets he says the
[19:37] mysteries even of the baptism in the
[19:39] name of the Lord Jesus and away from the
[19:42] oneness idea and so when I'm talking
[19:45] about the oneness of God I'm not
[19:47] referring to United United Pentecostal
[19:50] Church doctrine not referring to Jesus
[19:52] only doctrine I'm not even referring to
[19:54] the oneness doctrine I'm referring to
[19:57] that well the scripture that emphasizes
[19:59] that God is one person in 59 and the
[20:03] Palmer work worm locust cankerworm
[20:05] caterpillar brother Branham says many of
[20:07] you get off the wrong track when you try
[20:10] to think that God is one like your
[20:12] finger is one he can't be his own father
[20:15] he can't be now brother Branham is not
[20:16] trying to say there's three persons or
[20:18] there's two persons he's saying that the
[20:21] the invisible God who is a spirit he
[20:23] unfolds himself so when you have the
[20:26] invisible spirit that out of God so out
[20:29] of him went the logos so the logos is
[20:31] now with God we have an by number we
[20:36] have a distinction just like you are a
[20:39] body soul and spirit you're one person
[20:44] you're one express your but that your
[20:47] expressed in three different ways
[20:50] you're expressed through your soul
[20:51] you're expressed through your spirit and
[20:53] you're expressed by your body in those
[20:55] different senses that go along with it
[20:57] but you're you're not one like your
[21:00] fingers one neither is God one like your
[21:03] fingers one
[21:04] he's the unfolding God and Jesus is not
[21:07] his own father as per his humanity who
[21:11] is Jesus the Son of God John 1:18 no man
[21:23] has seen God at any time the only
[21:25] begotten Son which is in the bosom of
[21:27] the Father he hath declared him Jesus
[21:32] Christ is the image of the invisible God
[21:34] when you see him you're seeing God
[21:39] Colossians 1:15 who is the image of the
[21:41] invisible God the firstborn of every
[21:44] creature it's such a beautiful picture
[21:47] the scripture gives us when you see this
[21:51] God is invisible no man has seen him in
[21:55] at any time and yet he expresses himself
[21:57] he brings forth from himself a part of
[22:00] himself in order to reveal himself
[22:03] that's what you heard if we can
[22:06] understand who Jesus is correctly
[22:08] according to Scripture then we can see
[22:11] who we are if we don't understand him
[22:14] correctly and we make him a member a
[22:16] second member of the Godhead we can
[22:17] never understand who we are who we are
[22:23] Hebrews 1 2 and 3 we've already read
[22:26] that another one's I'm just gonna skip
[22:28] over that John 14 8 through 10 Philip
[22:31] saith unto Him Lord show us the father
[22:33] and it sufficeth us jesus saith unto him
[22:36] I love it
[22:38] have I been so long time with you and
[22:40] yet you have not known me Philip he that
[22:43] has seen me has seen the father and how
[22:45] sayest thou then show us the father
[22:46] believe is thou not that I am in the
[22:49] father and the father in me the words
[22:52] that I speak unto you I speak not of
[22:54] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[22:56] me he doeth the works sick where he
[23:00] where have you been Philip you've been
[23:02] watching
[23:03] you've seen what's been going on you're
[23:05] looking at the father right now okay
[23:09] Jesus is not his own father we under we
[23:11] understand that but as to expression who
[23:14] is Jesus the father he's expressed he is
[23:18] the father the invisible God made
[23:20] visible he is the man he's God manifests
[23:24] in the flesh
[23:28] second Corinthians 5:19 to wit that God
[23:31] was in Christ reconciling the world unto
[23:34] himself not imputing their trespasses
[23:36] unto them and hath committed unto us the
[23:39] word of reconciliation
[23:42] second Corinthians 4:6 for God was
[23:45] commanded the light to shine out of
[23:46] darkness as shined in our hearts to give
[23:49] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[23:51] of God in the face of Jesus Christ I
[23:54] love that the glory of God the Shekinah
[23:57] glory the very logos itself is revealed
[24:03] and manifested through what the face of
[24:07] Jesus Christ so you want to see the
[24:09] glory of God see Jesus Christ you have
[24:13] to see Jesus Christ let's go let's go a
[24:17] little bit further beyond that what is
[24:20] the bride called today the body of
[24:24] Christ
[24:25] so where is the glory of God manifested
[24:28] today through the body of Christ
[24:31] it's Christ is the beginning of the
[24:35] creation of God the body of Christ is
[24:38] the continuation of the creation of God
[24:41] he's the firstborn among from among the
[24:44] dad he's the firstfruits were the
[24:46] continuation first Timothy 3:16 and
[24:54] without controversy great is the mystery
[24:56] of godliness God was manifest in the
[24:58] flesh justified in the spirit seen of
[25:01] angels preached unto the Gentiles
[25:03] believed on in the world received up
[25:06] into glory
[25:08] beautiful Paul doesn't just leave that
[25:11] as a past tense thing he says God was
[25:14] manifest in the flesh but he's saying
[25:16] God was
[25:17] preached unto the Gentiles believed on
[25:18] in the world this he's continually being
[25:22] manifested in the flesh jesus never
[25:27] himself went to the gentiles right the
[25:30] scripture also says Paul says regarding
[25:34] his ministry
[25:35] it's a verse about the Messiah and he
[25:38] says the Messiah is going to be the
[25:40] light unto the Gentiles and Paul refers
[25:44] that to his ministry as a fulfillment of
[25:48] that scripture Wow isn't that beautiful
[25:50] Christ in you the hope of glory Matthew
[25:55] 16:13 very important verse for
[26:00] understanding the Godhead when Jesus
[26:02] came into the coasts of Caesarea
[26:03] Philippi he asked his disciples saying
[26:06] whom do men say that I the Son of Man am
[26:10] and you know they answered some say
[26:12] you're this some say Jeremiah or one of
[26:14] the prophets or John the Baptist and
[26:16] then he asked them but who do you say
[26:17] that I am and verse 16 and 17 and Simon
[26:21] Peter answered and said thou art the
[26:23] Christ the Son of the Living God and
[26:25] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[26:27] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[26:30] blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[26:31] my father which is in heaven Who am I he
[26:37] said Who am I you guys you're the
[26:40] Messiah The Anointed One the Son of the
[26:43] Living God and he says this revelation
[26:46] was given by the father break it down
[26:51] for a second Peter is looking at flesh
[26:54] and blood he's looking at a man standing
[26:56] in front of him he's following
[26:58] physically following him and Jesus says
[27:02] it wasn't any of that that revealed it
[27:04] it wasn't any human thinking it wasn't
[27:07] any human reasoning but the father came
[27:10] to you Simon and revealed the truth of
[27:13] who I am
[27:15] son of the living this verse doesn't
[27:19] make any sense but the fact is that the
[27:23] the Godhead that's
[27:26] that's the divine nature is what it's
[27:28] speaking of the at in other words the
[27:31] attributes of what makes God God and so
[27:36] here Paul is writing in Jesus Christ
[27:40] dwells all the nature and attributes of
[27:45] God everything that God is is revealed
[27:50] through Christ it's hid correct he's not
[27:53] a third he's not a member of the Trinity
[27:55] all that God is all his nature is put
[28:01] into and revealed through Christ Christ
[28:04] is the body and the father is the
[28:09] Godhead says who's doing the works my
[28:13] father that dwelleth in me does the
[28:16] works in him dwells all the fullness of
[28:20] the Godhead bodily doesn't say he is all
[28:23] the fullness of the Godhead bodily but
[28:24] it says it dwells in him and it's
[28:27] manifested through him Christ being the
[28:30] body the Son of God the man the father
[28:34] being the eternal spirit that dwells in
[28:37] him and manifests himself through him so
[28:40] who are we looking at when we're looking
[28:42] at Jesus Christ the father the I am the
[28:46] great I am amen
[28:48] so let's stand and pray gracious father
[28:54] we just come to you now Lord and we ask
[28:55] that your spirit would just abide with
[28:57] us continually Lord I pray you bless the
