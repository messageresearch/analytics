[39:21] forward to the word i made you a promise
[39:23] that we're going to
[39:25] start to
[39:26] look into something out of the book of
[39:28] revelation concerning the seven vials
[39:30] particularly the seventh vial and that
[39:32] seems like a millennial leap because
[39:34] we're jumping past say well when did we
[39:36] cover ages and seals and trumpets and
[39:38] all of that well
[39:40] just hang on we'll we'll we'll get there
[39:43] amen but i just have a burden on my
[39:45] heart today so
[39:46] i'm going to just uh start it on it
[39:48] today on this seventh vial of the book
[39:50] of revelation it's you're gonna see
[39:52] just shortly how relevant it is to the
[39:55] hour that you live in say well i thought
[39:57] all of that's in the tribulation well
[39:59] you'd be mistaken
[40:00] amen
[40:02] there's elements of it that are uh
[40:04] breaking in our age where we live in and
[40:06] it is actually the rhyme and reason of
[40:09] of all of the madness you see
[40:11] uh in the minds of man total insanity
[40:14] amen is because of these things so we're
[40:17] going to invite you to revelation
[40:19] chapter 16 and i heard all the fathers
[40:22] greeted wanna do the same thing and wish
[40:24] you all a very happy father's day
[40:28] amen i've been getting notices from all
[40:31] points and uh we want to make sure that
[40:33] everybody um is is welcomed here today
[40:37] and to say happy father's day in the
[40:39] building here and all of those out and
[40:40] all of those streaming amen praise the
[40:42] lord brother matt worked some of his
[40:44] magic today we i got up this morning the
[40:47] website was down so all you streamers
[40:49] y'all are about to have nothing
[40:51] so i got a hold of brother matt and
[40:54] he uh did did what he does so well and
[40:56] got it back up and running so as far as
[40:58] i know we're going strong amen um we
[41:01] want to be remembered by the jd got a
[41:04] request for prayer
[41:05] battling a head coat over there
[41:08] and that's no fun when you're trying to
[41:09] preach the gospel and believe me the
[41:11] hours you have to keep and the pull that
[41:13] they put on your body
[41:15] last thing you want to be doing is
[41:16] fighting a head cold probably picked it
[41:18] up on the aircraft somewhere you know
[41:21] that put all those people in one tube
[41:23] and send you 35 000 feet in the air and
[41:25] you're up there for hours
[41:27] so we want to just pray the lord to have
[41:29] mercy on him well you remember brother
[41:31] jason this morning that the lord would
[41:33] help him amen and uh we want to see the
[41:35] word go forth in power when he comes
[41:37] home we want to hear the great
[41:38] testimonies of the great things god has
[41:40] done
[41:42] amen revelation chapter 16
[41:46] and we just have one uh verse
[41:49] and where we could read quite a few but
[41:51] it's not relevant to today
[41:53] and um i'm hoping actually to get to
[41:56] this verse that we're going to read
[41:58] um verse 17.
[42:02] and the seventh angel poured out his
[42:03] vial into the air
[42:06] and there came a great voice out of the
[42:08] temple of heaven from the throne saying
[42:11] it is done
[42:12] let's pray
[42:14] father we thank you now for
[42:16] your word this morning
[42:18] and i i stand here lord and i've i'm
[42:22] just so
[42:22] thankful to you for your instructions
[42:26] lord because it just is such a release
[42:28] it's such a an end to all strife knowing
[42:32] that we have the revealed word of this
[42:34] hour we don't have to guess at these
[42:36] things we can go back to what was
[42:39] established by a vindicated messenger
[42:41] lord and we see it dovetail with the
[42:43] scriptures everywhere now
[42:46] that's not in question that's not in
[42:48] question this morning we want to look at
[42:49] it so we can see where we fit into it
[42:53] and what is our position in this great
[42:56] drama this great plan that's been
[42:58] underway and is underway and is wrapping
[43:00] up soon and lord we want to know uh
[43:03] where we fit what is what are our
[43:05] marching orders this this informs our
[43:08] thinking as to how we should live and
[43:10] conduct ourselves it puts an urgency in
[43:12] our heart lord i've had such an urgency
[43:15] in my heart as i've studied it lord so i
[43:18] pray that that can transmit today and
[43:21] the people have some clearer
[43:22] understanding of why preachers preach
[43:26] the things that they do and get down
[43:28] into people's lives and deal with
[43:29] spirits and deal with uh addictions and
[43:32] transgressions and sins and are all the
[43:34] time pointing to these things lord
[43:36] there's a there's a there's a a force
[43:39] behind these things and we want to
[43:40] identify
[43:42] our enemy and your enemy in the word
[43:44] today we want to see the plan father so
[43:47] i pray you open it to us give us relaxed
[43:50] hearts and minds as we look into it now
[43:52] in jesus name amen god bless you friends
[43:55] you can be seated
[44:00] now
[44:01] i promised you a bunch of
[44:06] a bunch of images and diagrams and
[44:09] schematics
[44:10] um
[44:11] wednesday that when we got to it we were
[44:13] going to have that
[44:14] as i began to really try to
[44:17] bring it all together into preachable
[44:19] material
[44:21] i realized today that that's not going
[44:22] to work i may uh very likely will still
[44:25] have some of that going forward in fact
[44:27] i know i will because there's one very
[44:28] important one if i don't have anything
[44:30] else i'll need to show you that one but
[44:32] it won't be today
[44:34] so i'm i'm just going to ask you for
[44:36] your undivided attention you visitors
[44:39] don't worry my home church will tell you
[44:41] i'm not long-winded and i don't even
[44:43] actually believe in it so uh i want you
[44:45] to retain everything that we say so if
[44:48] you give me maybe you know
[44:50] i'll i'll hold my sermon to 35 or 40
[44:53] minutes but i'm going to need i'm going
[44:54] to need 25 to 30 minutes to build a
[44:57] build a platform so is that okay so once
[45:00] i get start preaching then start timing
[45:01] me and 35 40 minutes i'll wrap it up i
[45:04] promise you i'll pull the pull the chute
[45:06] stand on the brakes and we'll jump out
[45:09] amen so
[45:10] after the after gets stopped
[45:15] brother branham when he comes to
[45:19] um
[45:20] bring us these great mysteries out of
[45:21] the book of revelation we know that the
[45:24] book of revelation is the bride's book
[45:26] of the end time it's for her it's
[45:27] written for this age
[45:29] it was a book of great myst mysterious
[45:32] uh symbolism and things and it come to
[45:35] the church after saint paul was already
[45:38] gone home that's why you don't ever hear
[45:40] paul quoting out of the book of
[45:41] revelation
[45:42] and uh and john brings it back he's the
[45:45] last living apostle he brings it back as
[45:47] an aged veteran the last one standing of
[45:49] the original
[45:51] and the book is given and sent
[45:53] throughout all the churches but its
[45:55] mysteries would remain sealed up and and
[45:58] and hard to decipher and understand
[46:01] until the last day when god would again
[46:04] finish bookending his ages with a
[46:06] prophet he started the alpha age with a
[46:09] prophet which being saint paul and he's
[46:11] going to end it and did end it with an
[46:14] elijah ministry prophet at the omega age
[46:17] and so when brother branham came he
[46:19] started of course with the seven church
[46:22] ages perfectly he started with daniel 70
[46:24] weeks because he knew he would have to
[46:26] establish jacob's trouble that time of
[46:29] jacob's trouble he would have to
[46:30] establish and get that fixed in people's
[46:33] mind uh because you had all kinds of
[46:35] different ideas about that and so
[46:37] brother branham would establish you know
[46:40] where how that's going to come to israel
[46:43] and how it's going to take a gentile
[46:45] bride home and then there's going to be
[46:46] this much time in the tribulation and
[46:48] and how christ came in the middle of the
[46:50] week and was you know and crucified and
[46:52] then the last half of that 70th week has
[46:55] to be played out in the tribulation
[46:56] period after the bride after the gentile
[46:59] bride has gone from the earth he's going
[47:00] to make himself known
[47:02] to the 144 thousand and that's going to
[47:05] happen now it's interesting and we've
[47:07] said this before how that how that now
[47:10] and just follow me okay because i'm not
[47:12] you know me i'm i'm good at explaining
[47:14] things i'm a good storyteller i get it
[47:16] from sister gene and uh it's important
[47:18] to me that i not leave you blinking so
[47:21] i'm i'm gonna just draw you a mental
[47:23] picture all right so just stay with me
[47:25] and uh and i'll make it real clear to
[47:27] you it's a it's a real thing for me i i
[47:29] has to be made clear or i'll just stop
[47:31] until it is
[47:32] so
[47:33] last thing i want to do is leave you
[47:35] blinking and confused so so brother
[47:38] branham is going to establish you know
[47:40] how that's all working in that 70th week
[47:43] of daniel don't want to get bogged down
[47:44] in that and so
[47:46] we find that at the end of the
[47:49] during the tribulation you find you know
[47:52] that moses and elijah are martyred along
[47:55] with 144 000 and then but then we see
[47:57] them resurrected uh and they're standing
[48:00] there in revelation chapter 15 actually
[48:03] standing with the remnant of the woman's
[48:05] seed which was the unwise virgin because
[48:08] she died also in the tribulation she
[48:10] perished she died of martyr's death
[48:12] because she she rejected the bloody word
[48:15] that would have atoned for her so
[48:17] therefore she had to go in there and
[48:19] give her own blood because she rejected
[48:21] a bleeding word amen so so we realize
[48:24] that's what the word has done for us
[48:26] today friends you're not going in a
[48:28] rapture because you're a great person
[48:29] you're going in a rapture because of
[48:31] christ
[48:32] and he sent a word today that's a
[48:34] bleeding word that puts life down inside
[48:36] you and you're you're transformed paul
[48:39] taught us that we're transformed by the
[48:41] things we gaze at so now you want to
[48:44] think about the things you gaze at and
[48:45] the things you give your eyes and ears
[48:47] to friends it's more important than you
[48:49] might believe
[48:51] and so we need to be transformed not
[48:54] conformed to the world but transformed
[48:57] by the renewing of our mind and of
[48:59] course even though the the 144 thousand
[49:02] are standing there with the uh remnant
[49:05] of the woman's seed that foolish virgin
[49:07] we find out that the foolish virgin
[49:09] remain
[49:10] under under the position of the altar
[49:12] they're not in the millennium yet the
[49:14] 144 000 are you say well why they're
[49:17] there together why you know one of them
[49:19] has the song of moses one has the song
[49:21] of the lamb why do the 144 thousand get
[49:24] to go in and the foolish virgin have to
[49:26] wait till after the millennium because
[49:28] the 144 000 actually received this same
[49:32] message received the holy ghost baptism
[49:34] received the token and are born again
[49:37] see so quite naturally they're part of
[49:39] the first resurrection the unwise virgin
[49:41] will have to wait and come up at the
[49:43] general resurrection and the judgment
[49:45] where everybody gets a fair trial and
[49:47] that's where matthew 25 picks up they'll
[49:49] be granted eternal life it's obvious
[49:51] they don't have it because they're being
[49:53] judged and jesus promised that if you
[49:56] pass from death to life you'll never
[49:57] come to the judgment so isn't that
[49:59] beautiful amen our sins have gone ahead
[50:02] of us by the time you get there it's
[50:03] already fixed
[50:05] your seat on the throne is already saved
[50:08] with your name on it hallelujah
[50:10] oh mine so we're not down there before
[50:12] the throne being judged we're being
[50:14] judged right now this is god's judgment
[50:16] seat right now we shall all stand at the
[50:19] judgment seat and be judged i just
[50:21] choose here and now
[50:22] i don't want to go there and then amen
[50:25] so so we find then that that the
[50:28] that when he comes now brother branham
[50:30] goes from the 70 weeks he then comes
[50:32] into the seven church ages because he
[50:34] wants to show the history of the church
[50:37] how it's come from the days of the early
[50:39] apostles how we arrived at our hour now
[50:41] listen i want to also pitch this in
[50:44] i'm going to go methodically slow on
[50:47] purpose because i i've just been feeling
[50:49] quite a bit of anxiety trying to
[50:51] encapsulate all this into preachable
[50:53] material and uh it's not been easy i've
[50:56] got a lot to say it's going to take a
[50:58] lot of sermons but we're getting started
[51:00] on it today so if i don't get anything
[51:02] other than if i use up all my time on
[51:04] this foundation i'll still dismiss
[51:07] and we'll still be out and i still won't
[51:08] keep you long so so i'm i implore you to
[51:11] just stay with me because i told the
[51:13] lord in the back i just finally sit back
[51:15] took a deep breath and just slowed down
[51:18] and so i i really want to make this this
[51:20] if you miss how all of these parts build
[51:23] the foundation you're really going to
[51:24] get lost in the shuffle when we start
[51:26] showing you the applicable parts of it
[51:28] to to our lives
[51:30] so so we find then that you know brother
[51:33] branham would say out of the ages would
[51:35] come the seals and out of the seals
[51:37] would come the trumpets and out of the
[51:38] trumpets would come the vials and but
[51:41] but we realize that that the seals uh
[51:44] are the entire book of redemption it was
[51:48] that whole plan of god that he had in
[51:50] the back part of his mind remember
[51:52] brother branham and christ is the
[51:54] mystery said said the whole bible it's
[51:56] all just one goal it's all one purpose
[51:58] that god had in redemption his purpose
[52:01] was to have a family that he that would
[52:03] be an expression of him they wouldn't be
[52:06] a different part they'd be of the same
[52:08] part you're not of a different material
[52:10] you're of the same material which is why
[52:12] you have the ability blessed are your
[52:14] eyes for you see and your eyes see
[52:17] because the same element that makes this
[52:19] is the same element that lives in your
[52:21] heart
[52:22] and it was placed there as a gene of god
[52:24] before before you were born you already
[52:27] your name and the lamb's book of life
[52:29] and so
[52:30] so we find then that that he said you
[52:33] know the seals are the entire book and
[52:35] once the seals then
[52:37] are are given by revelation then it's
[52:39] all there then the understanding of the
[52:42] ages and the seals and the 70 weeks and
[52:45] the and the trumpets and the vials we
[52:47] understand it all but you under you want
[52:49] to get it that that that seventh seal is
[52:52] at the very top it's at the very very
[52:56] top everything is under that seventh
[52:58] seal all the six seals are understood
[53:01] because the seventh one opened up see
[53:04] and so brother branham talks about how
[53:06] that it was a sealed book and he talks
[53:08] about scrolls being rolled now i'm not i
[53:10] don't have a rolls of scroll but i can
[53:13] show you in this kind of a book and and
[53:15] get you to i think i can get you put an
[53:17] image in your mind you catch it so it's
[53:19] it's a it's as if it's as if right in
[53:21] the middle there's the first seal and
[53:24] then a little while later he drops a
[53:26] second one and then a third one and then
[53:28] a fourth one and then a fifth one and
[53:31] then a sixth one and then he closes the
[53:33] whole thing and now it's sealed the
[53:35] seventh seal has the whole thing sealed
[53:37] so when he breaks the seventh seal then
[53:40] then now we can say there's the sixth
[53:42] one there's the fifth one there's the
[53:44] fourth one there's the third one there's
[53:46] the second one there's the first one
[53:48] you understand so and and then
[53:51] and then when you're understanding the
[53:53] seals the whole plan of redemption then
[53:56] suddenly you get some teaching about
[53:58] what the trumpets are and what the vows
[54:00] are and how what the woes are and how
[54:02] god is moving down through seven church
[54:06] ages and he's calling a bride out for
[54:09] his name's sake and he's literally
[54:11] taking every age and giving them a piece
[54:14] of himself a piece of himself it goes
[54:16] off and then it gets restored and it
[54:18] comes back at the end time now for the
[54:20] fully unveiled word to do what to
[54:23] transform you into the thing you gaze at
[54:28] so that when the seventh seal
[54:31] was un was unveiled was broken it
[54:35] unveiled the mystery of christ
[54:38] and when it unveiled the mystery of
[54:41] christ it unveiled the bride of christ
[54:43] because she's a part of him
[54:46] oh that's so beautiful all right
[54:49] so because the the ages are under the
[54:51] seals the trumpets are under the seals
[54:53] the vials are under the seals uh the
[54:56] seals are what sealed the book in fact
[54:58] is the seventh seal
[55:00] which is the mystery of god
[55:02] continues unfolding all the way through
[55:04] the tribulation just because we leave
[55:06] the earth the seven still still
[55:08] unwinding it unwinds through daniel's
[55:10] that last half of daniel's 70th week it
[55:12] done it unwinds under all the vials and
[55:15] all and everything in the fullness it
[55:17] unwinds even in the millennium it's
[55:19] still unwinding in the millennium
[55:21] because the millennium is still in time
[55:24] see
[55:25] so consequently
[55:27] for those who go in a rapture how many
[55:29] are planning it
[55:31] amen good how many are planning it now
[55:34] planning to go in a rapture
[55:36] well then congratulations
[55:38] you're right now in the year 2022

[57:08] i got a race to run glory
[57:10] hallelujah how many are running it today
[57:14] amen praise the lord
[57:17] we have to learn that one guys
[57:19] that's that's from back in brother matt
[57:21] start helping me sing now we learned
[57:22] that when he was just a kid
[57:25] amen sister priscilla wallace sings that
[57:27] i'm gonna have to have her come down and
[57:28] sing it for us and teach it to us
[57:32] so it's all a plan of redemption that
[57:34] was sealed up in the book
[57:37] and in that book then god we found out
[57:39] has one purpose one goal one objective
[57:42] that he's been brother bottom said that
[57:43] he's been trying to achieve and all the
[57:46] stories and all the people in the bible
[57:49] yeah the rapture's in a three-phase
[57:51] cycle yes god had a three-phase plan
[57:54] because he wanted to make himself fully
[57:56] known in christ and then he wanted to
[57:57] get preeminence through the holy ghost
[57:59] baptism in his church and then he wants
[58:01] to restore the kingdom to its right
[58:02] position that fell by sin in the garden
[58:04] that's his three steps but he only has
[58:06] one goal and his one goal the three
[58:08] steps is just how he's pulling it off
[58:10] and you're in that time where god has
[58:12] now took seven ages to restore his brag
[58:15] tree and you're now with the fruit in
[58:18] the top of the tree in the presence of
[58:20] the sun ready for the sleeping saints to
[58:22] come back and a body change to ensue and
[58:26] glory bound we go
[58:28] hallelujah
[58:32] so it's really all a plan of redemption
[58:35] sealed with seven seals
[58:37] and it's just that certain parts of it
[58:39] he calls ages
[58:40] certain parts of it he calls trumpets
[58:42] certain parts of it he calls vials don't
[58:44] worry about worry about trumpets and
[58:46] seals we're not gonna go into that today
[58:48] we're only going to cover those as it as
[58:50] it's relevant to the vials because
[58:52] that's my burden
[58:53] because it's under that seventh vial
[58:56] you're going to be shocked at how the
[58:58] vials have played out
[59:00] partially
[59:01] all the way to now
[59:03] and and he poured something into the air
[59:06] and that's that's affecting the minds of
[59:09] humanity all over the world
[59:12] and the only people who are either not
[59:14] insane or not going insane is those who
[59:18] have the mind of christ
[59:20] there's only one elected son that's
[59:22] jesus there's only one sane mind that's
[59:25] christ
[59:26] amen and so let that mind which was in
[59:29] him be in you
[59:31] see and so because he was an elected son
[59:34] it's not me the man that comes
[59:36] predestinated it's a it's a seed of god
[59:39] i was in him
[59:40] he was predestined he is the elected son
[59:43] how did you get elected i was in him so
[59:46] i'm an expression of him how do you know
[59:48] because i when i saw his word i
[59:50] recognized it and i believed it and i
[59:53] and it wasn't just a mental thing i
[59:55] desire to become it in fact is the more
[59:57] i understand it the more i want to be it
[1:00:00] the more i see of jesus the less i want
[1:00:03] to be me i don't want to be me anymore
[1:00:07] me is no good
[1:00:09] i want to be him
[1:00:12] me frustrates me
[1:00:16] me gets on me nerves
[1:00:19] me hinders me
[1:00:21] we have seen the enemy
[1:00:23] and it is us
[1:00:26] that man in the mirror
[1:00:28] i said to the church
[1:00:30] for some of you visitors i said to the
[1:00:31] church please don't have don't let the
[1:00:33] greatest enemy you have live between
[1:00:35] your ears
[1:00:37] please have the mind of christ
[1:00:42] so
[1:00:43] in the excuse me in the early church
[1:00:46] then
[1:00:48] the plan of redemption of course
[1:00:52] the plan of redemption would certainly
[1:00:53] say well okay they had it in the early
[1:00:55] church and then it was lost and now
[1:00:56] we've got it so okay brother jason put
[1:00:58] all that together how did that work all
[1:01:00] right first of all you have to
[1:01:01] understand that the message we have is
[1:01:03] not a new message
[1:01:04] it's not another christ
[1:01:07] in fact is that's what they accuse us of
[1:01:10] but that they actually have a word for
[1:01:11] that in psychology and i don't have it
[1:01:13] in front of me um i could almost recall
[1:01:16] it but it's where somebody has a problem
[1:01:19] so they accuse you of having it because
[1:01:20] they actually have it themselves and
[1:01:22] they're trying to hide and so they
[1:01:23] accuse you of having the very thing
[1:01:25] that's infecting them
[1:01:27] and uh and so the world says we follow
[1:01:30] another jesus and it's exact opposite of
[1:01:32] that
[1:01:32] they're they're the ones who paul said
[1:01:35] that you would follow another jesus whom
[1:01:37] we have not preached and that other
[1:01:39] jesus is a man-made idea of organized
[1:01:42] religion and that's definitely not what
[1:01:44] we have that's what the world hides
[1:01:47] behind we have the living word and the
[1:01:50] living god say how do you know he's
[1:01:51] alive because he proves it in our lives
[1:01:55] he proves it by keeping his word in our
[1:01:58] lives
[1:01:58] every day i'm going to tell you
[1:02:00] something friends if you want to see the
[1:02:02] living god in motion then you have come
[1:02:04] to the right place because we have we
[1:02:06] have the living god and living realities
[1:02:08] in our lives the the sick are healed and
[1:02:11] teenagers are filled with the holy
[1:02:13] spirit and people are delivered and
[1:02:14] marriages are healed and and minds are
[1:02:16] healed and and people get instructed on
[1:02:19] how to come into the image of the word
[1:02:21] of god and it's a wonderful place to be
[1:02:24] see
[1:02:27] so in the early church of course then
[1:02:28] the plan of redemption
[1:02:30] of course it certainly wasn't sealed to
[1:02:32] saint paul the uh the original book of
[1:02:35] acts church actually
[1:02:37] uh we find and this is an important
[1:02:38] point i don't want to just hurry over
[1:02:40] this i because there's some confusion
[1:02:43] that that the message of the hour is
[1:02:46] something that we understand brother
[1:02:47] branham understood more than you know
[1:02:50] this message goes beyond saint paul
[1:02:52] which is contrary to everything we and
[1:02:54] branham said but that's what people
[1:02:55] believe say well is it all that
[1:02:57] dangerous it sure is because if the
[1:03:00] devil can get you to believe that then
[1:03:01] the next little half step he wants you
[1:03:03] to believe is you now are further than
[1:03:05] brother branham
[1:03:06] you see and then and then you say well
[1:03:09] does it get worse it gets much worse
[1:03:11] because then that that there's this
[1:03:13] thinking that that puts so much emphasis
[1:03:16] in the bride that it diminishes the
[1:03:18] supremacy of christ
[1:03:21] see and so just remember he's the main
[1:03:23] article
[1:03:25] a bride yes we have a great privilege
[1:03:27] but it's christ that's who we love
[1:03:29] that's who we serve that's who we
[1:03:31] worship that's why we live is because of
[1:03:34] him
[1:03:35] amen
[1:03:36] so it certainly wasn't sealed to paul
[1:03:39] so we find in fact is that original book
[1:03:41] of acts church is that the kind of
[1:03:42] church you want to be
[1:03:44] so it was that original book of acts
[1:03:47] church
[1:03:48] that we find saint paul as a prophet to
[1:03:50] the alpha church that's where he
[1:03:52] established i mean think about
[1:03:54] everything we believe and understand it
[1:03:56] was paul who established uh what
[1:03:58] happened in the garden at the time of
[1:04:00] the original sin he talks about it very
[1:04:03] candidly uh to the corinthians in second
[1:04:05] corinthians 11 paul
[1:04:07] is going to break it down there and in
[1:04:09] other places about what happened how it
[1:04:12] would happen and his real and that's
[1:04:14] just the that's just the nuts and bolts
[1:04:16] of it that's just x's and o's what
[1:04:18] happened
[1:04:19] paul's real
[1:04:21] fear was is what it would mean if this
[1:04:24] new fledgling church went in the same
[1:04:27] direction that eve did
[1:04:29] and that's why he says i would to god
[1:04:31] that you bear with me in my folly you
[1:04:33] remember and indeed bear with me for
[1:04:34] i've i'm jealous over you with a godly
[1:04:36] jealousy i've espoused you to one
[1:04:38] husband that i may present you to christ
[1:04:40] as a chaste virgin virgin but i fear
[1:04:43] i fear lest by any means at all any
[1:04:46] means whether it's the pleasures of sin
[1:04:49] or the entertainments of the world or
[1:04:51] misinterpreted theology or missing too
[1:04:54] much church or not having a good enough
[1:04:56] prayer life if by any means that he says
[1:04:58] as the serpent beguiled eve through his
[1:05:01] subtlety
[1:05:03] so your minds should be corrupted from
[1:05:06] the simplicity that is in christ
[1:05:11] so and from there of course paul goes on
[1:05:13] to establish election by or the origin
[1:05:15] of god to see gene
[1:05:18] i mean how it's all god's plan paul
[1:05:20] covers all of that it's all god's plan i
[1:05:22] got all kinds of scripture references
[1:05:23] don't need to read them all your bible
[1:05:25] readers you know how that paul talks
[1:05:27] about how it's all god's plan and
[1:05:30] god's purpose and we're all called in
[1:05:32] him before the foundation of the world
[1:05:34] and then and then paul goes from there
[1:05:36] and he he goes into the book of romans
[1:05:38] and he he starts to tackle the
[1:05:40] impossible problem for all of god's
[1:05:41] family who are born in sin you know he
[1:05:44] says i find a law remember that when i
[1:05:46] would do good evil is present
[1:05:48] now here he is here he is a son of god a
[1:05:51] prophet an apostle filled with the holy
[1:05:54] spirit and says but when i would do good
[1:05:55] evil is present so he said now here's
[1:05:57] his conundrum i find uh that i delight
[1:06:01] in the law of god after the inward man
[1:06:03] but
[1:06:04] man i see another law in my members
[1:06:09] wow
[1:06:10] that's that's the guy fighting me that's
[1:06:12] the greatest battle ever fought it's
[1:06:14] warring against the law of my mind and
[1:06:18] bringing me into captivity of the law of
[1:06:20] sin which is in my members and so so so
[1:06:24] now brother branham himself then comes
[1:06:26] in the omega age and and and and brings
[1:06:30] now a full restoration augmenting what
[1:06:33] paul says in chapter 8 verse 1 there is
[1:06:36] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:06:39] which are in christ see now that's
[1:06:42] that's that's the plan that's the answer
[1:06:45] to the impossible problem that's the
[1:06:47] answer in the plan of redemption there
[1:06:49] is therefore now no condemnation paul
[1:06:51] has just said i got this problem in my
[1:06:53] flesh
[1:06:54] but i want to live after the inward man
[1:06:56] i'm a wretched man but who'll deliver me
[1:06:58] christ will deliver me because once i'm
[1:07:01] in him there is now therefore and
[1:07:02] brother branham said you're not just
[1:07:04] justified like forgiven for doing it it
[1:07:06] takes it all the way back like you never
[1:07:09] did it in the first place
[1:07:12] and what does it do it takes that sin
[1:07:14] and transgression ever sin and every
[1:07:16] transgression you ever committed or will
[1:07:19] ever commit and it puts it back on the
[1:07:21] head of the original sinner which was
[1:07:23] lucifer when he rebelled against christ
[1:07:26] and tried to establish a kingdom and war
[1:07:29] ensued in heaven spilled over into the
[1:07:30] earth and here we are
[1:07:33] fighting the greatest battle ever fought
[1:07:37] see
[1:07:39] and so we we we find that
[1:07:43] brother branham says how that it
[1:07:45] it's like
[1:07:47] putting ink in bleach
[1:07:49] it breaks it completely back
[1:07:52] to the original owner of the sin
[1:07:54] amen
[1:07:55] i want you to know something friend
[1:07:57] your sin you're not the original owner
[1:07:59] of that
[1:08:01] paul paul admits
[1:08:03] paul admits freely that at one time
[1:08:06] we all had our conversation in the lust
[1:08:08] of the flesh the things of the world and
[1:08:10] we were by very nature
[1:08:12] that's where your soul is
[1:08:14] your nature of the spirit by by nature
[1:08:17] we were all the children of wrath just
[1:08:18] like everybody else but it was god rich
[1:08:21] in mercy who loved us why were you were
[1:08:23] yet a sinner see and so so so we find
[1:08:26] that that you you you were born with
[1:08:29] that impossible condition of a fallen
[1:08:32] nature but i'm gonna say to you today
[1:08:35] that was never your original nature
[1:08:38] you're not the original sinner
[1:08:40] the original sinner was lucifer and
[1:08:42] that's why when you take your your sins
[1:08:45] and they drop in the blood of the lord
[1:08:47] jesus christ like ink drops into bleach
[1:08:50] it completely annihilates it and sends
[1:08:52] it back to the original owner of the sin
[1:08:55] satan was the first one to unbelieve
[1:08:58] he was a disbeliever an unbeliever of
[1:09:00] god's word and rebelled against it
[1:09:03] so brother branham said taught us it
[1:09:05] goes back on his head
[1:09:07] and he has to answer for everything he
[1:09:09] tripped and
[1:09:10] trapped me into
[1:09:13] goody goody goody
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:17] so this was the solution
[1:09:19] to the impossible condition brother
[1:09:21] branham
[1:09:22] would would
[1:09:23] carry carry on with that how that it
[1:09:26] would answer every transgression i'd
[1:09:28] ever committed paul goes on from there
[1:09:29] of course you know he carries on with
[1:09:31] adoption and
[1:09:33] you're bible readers he places sons and
[1:09:36] he goes on from there to um you know
[1:09:39] marriage and divorce and he fixes
[1:09:41] marriage in divorce he goes on from
[1:09:42] there to the future home i hath not seen
[1:09:45] here hath not heard neither half of it
[1:09:47] or the heart of men he goes on from
[1:09:49] there to talk about the mystery of the
[1:09:51] rapture how it's in three parts how that
[1:09:53] it's
[1:09:54] you know it's it's three parts that are
[1:09:55] going to divide the the resurrection of
[1:09:57] the of the sleeping from the change of
[1:09:59] our bodies before the man of sin is made
[1:10:02] manifest paul had all of that
[1:10:04] paul understood all of that mysteries
[1:10:07] see
[1:10:08] so we've been restored back to that and
[1:10:10] that's why brother branham said i only
[1:10:12] ever preached what paul preached it's
[1:10:13] why you can't impugn the message
[1:10:16] i can tell you as a as a teacher of this
[1:10:19] message my whole life studied it since a
[1:10:20] boy
[1:10:21] and you cannot impugn the message with
[1:10:23] the bible it's impossible
[1:10:25] i've had i've challenged people around
[1:10:27] around the world no one's ever been able
[1:10:28] to even get close to doing that because
[1:10:30] why
[1:10:31] when he when he said i only ever
[1:10:33] preached what paul preached and millions
[1:10:34] shouted out we're resting on that
[1:10:36] there's not just there's not just all
[1:10:38] that group there there's this group here
[1:10:40] today saying we're resting on that
[1:10:43] see
[1:10:45] and so of course then
[1:10:47] now i'm just coming just establishing
[1:10:49] the foundation i'm just showing you how
[1:10:51] god established his church and and then
[1:10:53] and then and then we find out then that
[1:10:55] after paul passes off the scene and
[1:10:58] the ages begin to drift from the pure
[1:11:00] word and
[1:11:01] and it begins to fall away and every
[1:11:03] time
[1:11:04] every time the church disbelieves a word
[1:11:07] of god a portion of the word of god then
[1:11:08] he seals that part up see and by the
[1:11:11] time you reach irenaeus uh
[1:11:14] brother branham said he's the last one
[1:11:16] now he's only he's only the student of
[1:11:18] of polycarp uh uh who's a student of
[1:11:21] john so it's only like a you know a
[1:11:23] grandfather father and a grandson so
[1:11:25] it's not a long time
[1:11:27] that by the time you reach irena's
[1:11:29] brother branham said he's the last one
[1:11:31] with a correct complete correct
[1:11:33] understanding of the godhead and so it
[1:11:36] keeps drifting of course and we know the
[1:11:38] history keeps drifting until christ is
[1:11:41] deposed and they they they crown a false
[1:11:44] prophet to lead them to a jezebel system
[1:11:47] and you know you know you've studied the
[1:11:49] the ages i don't want to get too bogged
[1:11:50] down in all that so
[1:11:52] so then when when a prophet comes in our
[1:11:54] in our day then now christ
[1:11:58] now christ has the son of man an uh uh
[1:12:01] an officer uh in the earth again a
[1:12:05] prophet in the earth as a ministry of
[1:12:07] the as a ministry of the son of man as a
[1:12:10] as an office of the son of man and why
[1:12:12] is that important because now god christ
[1:12:14] has someone he can deliver the book to
[1:12:17] and so he's going to because brother
[1:12:18] branham couldn't open the book only
[1:12:20] christ could open the book but christ
[1:12:21] couldn't come give it to the world he
[1:12:23] could only give it to a prophet
[1:12:25] they say well why because that's how
[1:12:27] he's always done it
[1:12:30] and he said he wouldn't do anything
[1:12:31] except he refers to revealed it to the
[1:12:33] prophets that's why all the apostles had
[1:12:35] to acquiesce to paul's teaching whether
[1:12:37] they wanted to or not whether it they
[1:12:39] didn't like it or not it didn't matter
[1:12:40] you had to say what paul said see
[1:12:43] and so and even even even to acquiesces
[1:12:46] to reluctantly agree with something even
[1:12:48] even reluctantly it might it might fly
[1:12:50] in the face of everything you ever
[1:12:52] learned but i'm here to tell you when
[1:12:54] god when christ reveals himself you have
[1:12:56] to say amen to him
[1:12:59] see
[1:13:00] amen
[1:13:02] and so so now he's got a prophet here he
[1:13:05] can deliver
[1:13:07] this open book to and it's all laying
[1:13:09] there see but he he wanted he wanted to
[1:13:11] deal with with different portions of it
[1:13:14] so so then you you remember that
[1:13:17] everything in this mystery of the last
[1:13:20] age whatever it is
[1:13:23] whatever it is it must come back to
[1:13:25] redemption
[1:13:26] because it's a book of redemption
[1:13:29] see
[1:13:30] it's the whole plan of redemption
[1:13:32] whether it's israel whether it's a
[1:13:34] gentile bride whether it's red you know
[1:13:37] it's all redemption whether it's the
[1:13:39] earth it's redemption it doesn't matter
[1:13:41] once we have once you have these basic
[1:13:43] principles down then i'm taking my time
[1:13:46] because you've got to see piece by piece
[1:13:48] as we go so wherever we talk about
[1:13:51] remember
[1:13:52] you can't change whatever is taught
[1:13:54] can't fly in the face of the original
[1:13:57] purpose
[1:13:58] to express christ
[1:14:00] and so when you're
[1:14:02] following something and you're not
[1:14:04] exactly expressing the word you're not
[1:14:07] exactly expressing the life of christ
[1:14:09] like the early church or like elijah of
[1:14:11] this day then you need to go back and
[1:14:13] reevaluate what you're feeding on
[1:14:16] you're not a bad person you just need to
[1:14:18] go back and reevaluate what you're
[1:14:19] feeding on see
[1:14:21] because it doesn't matter to me you
[1:14:22] could say brother jason come to my house
[1:14:24] i i planted a lovely apple tree in my
[1:14:27] backyard and it's got apples on i want
[1:14:28] you to come taste one see how you like
[1:14:29] it i show up at your house walk around
[1:14:31] your backyard and there's a banana tree
[1:14:35] and i have the sad news to break it to
[1:14:37] you brother i'm sorry you didn't plant
[1:14:39] apple seeds
[1:14:40] you planted banana seeds
[1:14:43] oh no i didn't oh yes you did oh let me
[1:14:46] show you my quotes let me show i don't
[1:14:47] care what quotes you've got
[1:14:49] i don't care what scriptures line them
[1:14:51] up how you want build a case but i'm
[1:14:53] looking at bananas
[1:14:55] it doesn't matter what you think you
[1:14:57] built or planted how many scriptures and
[1:15:00] quotes you can tie together it's got to
[1:15:02] produce the life of christ
[1:15:05] it's got to produce and you know what it
[1:15:07] is the life of christ doesn't it just
[1:15:09] include holy living
[1:15:10] it includes power and demonstration of
[1:15:13] the holy spirit
[1:15:14] it has overcoming power it has signs and
[1:15:16] wonders it has the miraculous it has
[1:15:19] prophecy it has the gifts of the spirit
[1:15:21] it has everything under flawless perfect
[1:15:24] control because a bride now is a mature
[1:15:27] lady who has surrendered her mind to the
[1:15:29] control of the holy spirit she's not
[1:15:32] those concerns of her pentecostal
[1:15:34] childhood uh are not are it's a moot
[1:15:37] point now because christ was never
[1:15:38] coming back to marry a little girl
[1:15:40] anyway he was coming back for a mature
[1:15:42] bride and so we she has certainly
[1:15:44] established herself in the earth by
[1:15:47] feeding on the word of god so
[1:15:49] so then it it's got to all come back
[1:15:53] it's got to all it must all end in a
[1:15:56] restored atom and a restored eve back in
[1:16:00] a restored eden all right so now
[1:16:04] you're with me
[1:16:05] all right good
[1:16:07] we'll take another block all right
[1:16:10] so so then god saw
[1:16:13] under his plan of redemption
[1:16:15] that there would be seven ages and he he
[1:16:19] types it everywhere this is the beauty
[1:16:21] uh
[1:16:23] when we look at this message
[1:16:25] and and i'm going to tell you something
[1:16:27] friends you're so privileged
[1:16:29] to believe something that is so provable
[1:16:31] in this book
[1:16:34] and it just is laced and dovetailed and
[1:16:36] typed and shadowed back and forth and
[1:16:38] back and forth and not only do all the
[1:16:41] verses not only do the verses not
[1:16:43] contradict each other the types don't
[1:16:45] contradict not only do the verses
[1:16:48] dovetail the types dovetail the shadows
[1:16:50] dovetail see
[1:16:51] and so so we find then that he he's
[1:16:54] going to show you say well we had seven
[1:16:57] church ages god always knew there was
[1:16:58] going to be seven church ages
[1:17:01] he always knew that he knew israel would
[1:17:03] reject the atonement god already knew
[1:17:05] that
[1:17:06] see he typed it
[1:17:07] all the way back in the old testament
[1:17:09] there's lots of places where we're just
[1:17:11] going to make a quick reference to just
[1:17:13] to build your confidence see so you know
[1:17:15] we've not followed cunningly devised
[1:17:17] tales this stuff is linkable and
[1:17:19] connectable all right so so we find then
[1:17:22] that that he types it all the way
[1:17:24] through god knowing that israel would
[1:17:26] reject the atonement when he came that
[1:17:28] this is why isaiah
[1:17:31] speaks about a messiah stricken
[1:17:34] a rejected uh how that israel that calls
[1:17:38] you know refers to him as an offering
[1:17:40] the lamb of god but he's going to be
[1:17:41] rejected and how that god would he's a
[1:17:44] man of of sorrows and acquainted with
[1:17:46] grief and and how that god would would
[1:17:49] take this oh my
[1:17:51] would take the sin of the whole world
[1:17:54] and put it on one man
[1:17:56] so that he could redeem his entire
[1:17:58] family and give an opportunity for even
[1:18:01] people who weren't in his gene pool as
[1:18:03] elected but but they all came from all
[1:18:06] life comes from god and he's going to
[1:18:08] give everybody a a an equal opportunity
[1:18:11] employment to believe the word of god
[1:18:14] and save yourself from this untoward
[1:18:16] generation but to his family you didn't
[1:18:19] choose him he said i've chosen you
[1:18:22] hallelujah
[1:18:24] he knew they would reject messiah isaiah
[1:18:27] referred to it david spoke of how they
[1:18:29] would expose his bones
[1:18:31] through beating and tearing of his flesh
[1:18:33] all my bones they stare at me david as a
[1:18:36] rejected king weeping over jerusalem
[1:18:38] jesus doing the same thing there weeping
[1:18:40] over jerusalem jerusalem jerusalem how
[1:18:42] oft would i have covered you so so the
[1:18:44] book of moses in genesis 48 speaks then
[1:18:48] you you can look you can see manasseh
[1:18:50] and ephraim when when joseph brings his
[1:18:54] boys to his prophet daddy for his
[1:18:56] blessing and the bible says joseph is
[1:18:58] very careful he takes the oldest son in
[1:19:01] his left hand to guide him to the right
[1:19:04] hand of his prophet and he take of the
[1:19:06] prophet his dad who's a prophet and he
[1:19:09] takes the younger son with his right
[1:19:12] hand to the left hand of his dad so that
[1:19:15] his father will put the right hand of
[1:19:17] blessing on the oldest child the
[1:19:19] firstborn manasseh and he'll he'll bless
[1:19:22] the younger also but the main one's
[1:19:24] going to go to manasseh which would
[1:19:25] represent israel and that's not the kind
[1:19:27] of bride that christ was going to take
[1:19:29] even joseph himself
[1:19:31] had married a gentile bride
[1:19:34] and so when the prophet reaches out to
[1:19:36] put his hands the holy spirit crosses
[1:19:39] his hands and he puts his right hand on
[1:19:41] the younger and joseph is praying and
[1:19:44] everybody's praying and everybody's
[1:19:45] happy and joseph is so happy until he
[1:19:46] opens his eyes
[1:19:48] and he's seeing a prophet do something
[1:19:49] he don't agree with
[1:19:53] now he's upset yeah the bible said he
[1:19:55] was he said he would i forget the word
[1:19:57] the king james uses all he got he was
[1:19:59] alarmed almost like angry
[1:20:01] and he he actually
[1:20:03] is so audacious
[1:20:05] that he lifts the hand of a prophet
[1:20:08] then
[1:20:08] mid blessing mid prayer
[1:20:10] when a prophet is talking to god and
[1:20:13] joseph is so upset in his human spirit
[1:20:15] he lifts his hand and says not so father
[1:20:16] gonna correct the prophet
[1:20:19] and the prophet pulls back and refuses
[1:20:21] to uncross it says i know my son you
[1:20:23] know what you think i don't know this
[1:20:24] said the lord hath crossed my hands
[1:20:27] said don't worry about manasseh god will
[1:20:29] bless him too and he'll become a nation
[1:20:31] but this younger one this is the one
[1:20:33] who's going to get the big blessing this
[1:20:35] is the one this is a gentile
[1:20:36] representation that it's going to cross
[1:20:39] over into the gentiles and there's and
[1:20:41] there and they're not going to be
[1:20:42] believers
[1:20:44] just just a little in a little tiny area
[1:20:46] of palestine that a jew can't even leave
[1:20:49] without being backslid this thing's
[1:20:51] gonna go global
[1:20:52] and it doesn't matter and jesus said the
[1:20:55] time is coming and now is when you won't
[1:20:57] say it we'll worship in jerusalem or
[1:20:59] we'll worship in here but but whoever
[1:21:01] will worship will have to do it in
[1:21:03] spirit and in truth wherever he is
[1:21:06] it won't matter where he's from or what
[1:21:08] he's done or how he was born he can have
[1:21:11] access back to god that's the plan of
[1:21:14] redemption
[1:21:16] see
[1:21:18] and so he knew then see
[1:21:22] he he he knew
[1:21:24] uh
[1:21:25] you know too
[1:21:26] even if you take the trumpets okay and
[1:21:28] i'll just mention them like this just
[1:21:30] this for a second i'm just showing you
[1:21:31] all i'm doing is
[1:21:33] i'm not teaching on the trumpets today
[1:21:35] i'm only showing you that
[1:21:37] that god knew everything in advance
[1:21:41] this is why when john
[1:21:43] is is being given the tour
[1:21:46] through the book of revelation or
[1:21:47] signifying angel comes
[1:21:49] john tries to worship this signifying
[1:21:51] angel several times
[1:21:53] and the signifying angel keeps stopping
[1:21:55] him and says don't worship me
[1:21:56] i'm just your brother i'm your fellow
[1:21:58] servant and one of the prophets worship
[1:22:01] god
[1:22:02] and so here john now is god so now when
[1:22:06] you read the book of revelation and you
[1:22:08] read about this prophet from the future
[1:22:12] see
[1:22:13] and so here in the book of revelation
[1:22:14] people say why why are you always
[1:22:16] talking about a prophet at the end time
[1:22:17] well it was in the bible
[1:22:19] and john is actually having a
[1:22:20] conversation with this prophet from the
[1:22:22] future and it is this prophet from the
[1:22:25] future who's showing him all of these
[1:22:26] mysteries
[1:22:28] and taking him it's it's the same one he
[1:22:30] comes up under the vials because the the
[1:22:33] the of course the messengers
[1:22:35] under the vials would be the same as the
[1:22:37] seven messengers to the ages because
[1:22:39] vows are judgment it's it's the it's the
[1:22:42] rejection of their seven age messages of
[1:22:45] why the judgment's coming
[1:22:48] does that make sense to you see just
[1:22:50] like brother branham talks about that
[1:22:51] under the seals he set a seal partially
[1:22:53] opened and a messenger catches it and
[1:22:56] runs with it and the people gather
[1:22:57] around the word and then the messenger
[1:22:59] goes off the scene god lays away that
[1:23:01] age and uh lays them away in the grave
[1:23:04] lays them asleep remember jesus said you
[1:23:06] know in the midnight hour because every
[1:23:08] age slept every age slept every age
[1:23:10] slept but in the midnight hour coming to
[1:23:12] now the end time says a christ said the
[1:23:15] bridegroom cometh
[1:23:16] see and all of them rose to try to trim
[1:23:19] their lamps this is flat trimming time
[1:23:23] and so he
[1:23:24] so we we find that that that brother
[1:23:27] branham says
[1:23:28] and then and then there and then god
[1:23:30] drops a temporary judgment
[1:23:33] on that age in that church age for why
[1:23:36] for rejecting the word see
[1:23:38] and and that's why you read that that's
[1:23:41] why i'll show you my next the next time
[1:23:43] we're covering this i'll show you that
[1:23:45] the trumpets and the vials uniquely run
[1:23:47] together
[1:23:48] they they all they're all perfectly
[1:23:51] harmonious they they even the judgment
[1:23:53] is on the same thing only in the
[1:23:55] trumpets you read about a third of this
[1:23:57] and a third of that a third of this
[1:23:58] because this is the judgments falling
[1:24:01] on israel uh down through the ages but
[1:24:04] then there's there's an element of the
[1:24:06] vial also that's matching the trumpet
[1:24:08] age for age that's falling on the
[1:24:10] antichrist system and falling on the
[1:24:12] world partially
[1:24:14] you see in the end time when it comes to
[1:24:16] the seventh the seventh is the
[1:24:17] completion of everything and that's why
[1:24:19] after the trip when the during the
[1:24:21] tribulation when the bride is gone then
[1:24:23] you have the vials in their fullness
[1:24:25] they're fully poured out and here comes
[1:24:28] seven angels to do it and one of the
[1:24:30] seven coming and he's the same one who
[1:24:33] would show him the great harlot he's the
[1:24:36] same one who would show him the bride
[1:24:38] the lamb's wife if that's not elijah the
[1:24:40] prophet i don't know my bible
[1:24:42] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:24:44] because why the world has rejected the
[1:24:47] the complete message of redemption and
[1:24:50] now the bride is gone and the man of sin
[1:24:52] goes into flesh and he begins his right
[1:24:55] and you don't want to be here during
[1:24:57] that time
[1:25:00] now everything i just said might have
[1:25:02] left you blinking don't worry i'll cover
[1:25:03] that again i just had to get that out
[1:25:07] we'll cover it a little slower
[1:25:11] so i i'm just showing you that that so
[1:25:13] that you can see how god knew it all
[1:25:16] i mean when when he
[1:25:18] you know when he's gonna
[1:25:20] when he's going to come to
[1:25:23] the ages or when he's going to come to
[1:25:25] the trumpets
[1:25:26] this is exactly why
[1:25:28] the trumpets in order to understand them
[1:25:31] you have to go back
[1:25:33] all the way back to the other book of
[1:25:34] moses leviticus
[1:25:36] and you have to catch the seven
[1:25:38] feast times and you you have to you have
[1:25:40] to start you know you have to you have
[1:25:42] to start with christ and and i and i'm
[1:25:44] not here to teach on the feast days
[1:25:46] that's a whole other topic in and of
[1:25:47] itself but but you find that it that
[1:25:49] it's it's gonna go from christ the lamb
[1:25:51] it's all christ in his earthly part
[1:25:53] first three are christ in his earthly
[1:25:54] ministry because
[1:25:55] from the time that that that you come
[1:25:58] from this this lamb of god this this
[1:26:01] past uh this this this passover feast
[1:26:04] then what are you gonna have you're
[1:26:05] gonna go to the unleavened bread because
[1:26:06] christ had no leaven in him
[1:26:08] see and then you're gonna go to first
[1:26:10] fruits the third one because why he's up
[1:26:12] out of the grave
[1:26:14] see he's the first fruits of them and
[1:26:16] and everybody's gonna come up just like
[1:26:17] that and then what's your fourth feast
[1:26:19] it's pentecost that's the holy ghost
[1:26:21] falling see god knew that
[1:26:23] god knew that all the way in the old
[1:26:25] testament he knew that would play out
[1:26:27] and at sixteen hundred years later the
[1:26:30] cycle would start and then that would
[1:26:32] run two thousand years and so god
[1:26:34] literally predicts the future in the
[1:26:37] history and then it comes to pass and
[1:26:39] then people say they don't believe it
[1:26:43] and it literally and that's why
[1:26:45] that that when it comes to the to the
[1:26:47] pentecostal now it's not unleavened
[1:26:50] it's not an unleavened bread it's two
[1:26:52] loaves and they have leaven in them
[1:26:54] because why it's jew and gentile and
[1:26:56] it's got sin in it it's gonna have to be
[1:26:58] burned by fire under the pentecostal
[1:27:00] experience that's the only way you get
[1:27:02] the leaven and the sin out of you is to
[1:27:05] the fire of the holy ghost baptism
[1:27:09] and then for 2000 years we're going to
[1:27:11] go under the feast of pentecost all the
[1:27:13] way until the time of the feast of
[1:27:14] trumpets for the jews and what does it
[1:27:16] do starts calling israel back home which
[1:27:19] that's exactly what happened in the book
[1:27:20] of revelation i'm getting way ahead of
[1:27:22] myself
[1:27:23] and then and then of course what's their
[1:27:25] then then they're going to come from the
[1:27:26] feast of trumpets then they're going to
[1:27:28] come to the sixth one and and here's the
[1:27:31] feast of atonement
[1:27:32] and what is it moses and elijah bringing
[1:27:34] them the one they rejected after the
[1:27:36] bride's done going home
[1:27:37] and then the only thing left now oh my
[1:27:41] then they come to the feast of
[1:27:42] tabernacles because that's the change of
[1:27:44] bodies that's the millennium
[1:27:48] and you can't make this stuff up that
[1:27:51] fits flawlessly and history uh
[1:27:56] proves it
[1:27:57] because every way as brother branham
[1:27:59] went through the ages
[1:28:01] and he went through the seals and he
[1:28:03] correlated it to history that you can
[1:28:06] google
[1:28:08] and you can see that the history matched
[1:28:10] the word
[1:28:11] thousands of years in advance
[1:28:15] then why would i not believe this
[1:28:17] message of the hour when it come in the
[1:28:18] last day just like it promised it would
[1:28:21] to do what to open the seals and reveal
[1:28:24] christ and reveal the word and we could
[1:28:26] eat our way into a body change friends
[1:28:32] see so
[1:28:33] this is why you see it happening
[1:28:36] like that
[1:28:37] all right
[1:28:39] now
[1:28:41] i'm
[1:28:42] almost out of time i got 10 minutes
[1:28:47] now
[1:28:48] a lot of the stuff i just said in
[1:28:49] overview
[1:28:51] i'll show it to you a little more clear
[1:28:53] it comes with repetition the more you
[1:28:54] hear it suddenly you'll start to
[1:28:56] remember it suddenly the puzzle starts
[1:28:58] to come together and you see a picture
[1:29:00] don't stress over today if you're
[1:29:02] sitting there and you're like okay well
[1:29:04] wait which came from i mean who'd he
[1:29:05] what who's on first what what i mean
[1:29:08] wait a minute was it a what feast to
[1:29:10] what trumpet don't worry don't worry
[1:29:12] breathe just
[1:29:14] calm down it's all good i'm going to
[1:29:16] take my time and we're going to really
[1:29:18] break it down slow but now i want to
[1:29:20] come a little bit and touch on my burden
[1:29:21] today i'm just now getting to my to my
[1:29:23] first verse
[1:29:26] so
[1:29:27] brother branham says in the message
[1:29:30] in 1960
[1:29:32] the revelation that was given to me
[1:29:34] because
[1:29:35] i'll just give you a preview
[1:29:37] of my
[1:29:39] burden okay this is good i should do
[1:29:41] this yeah this is a good idea
[1:29:44] people think
[1:29:46] that brother branham
[1:29:48] said well brother i'm never preached on
[1:29:49] the trumpets you'd be
[1:29:50] mistaken he took a whole series on it
[1:29:54] over over a whole more than a month
[1:29:57] and preached it at home in his own
[1:29:58] pulpit
[1:29:59] brother branham comes in 1965. now i'm
[1:30:02] just going to tell you a little story
[1:30:03] and i'm going to read a couple quotes
[1:30:04] and we're going to stop for today okay
[1:30:08] so brother branham comes to the pulpit
[1:30:11] in july
[1:30:12] 1965.
[1:30:14] and he comes to the tabernacle
[1:30:17] oh i think on july i believe the 11th
[1:30:20] and the message is shamed
[1:30:22] and brother branham says now
[1:30:24] we came here for the express purpose to
[1:30:27] preach on those vials
[1:30:29] and he said i've got it on my heart
[1:30:31] feeling definitely led and he said we
[1:30:33] tried to get the school auditorium they
[1:30:35] wouldn't give it to us they said no too
[1:30:37] many people crowd in things get broke
[1:30:38] and tore up and
[1:30:40] billy you know we love you uh you're a
[1:30:42] hometown boy but we're not gonna let you
[1:30:44] do it anymore it's just it's just
[1:30:46] too many people come to hear you
[1:30:48] and so so brother branham comes back and
[1:30:51] sits down with the board of trustees
[1:30:53] this is all on tape
[1:30:55] and he's just describing it
[1:30:57] and he
[1:30:58] he says now
[1:31:00] i talk to the board what can we do he
[1:31:02] said now we don't have enough room here
[1:31:04] in the tabernacle for all the people he
[1:31:07] said could you imagine us because they
[1:31:08] had done done that in the seals and they
[1:31:10] seen what how i mean that really got bad
[1:31:12] i mean that was like crowding
[1:31:14] extraordinary fire marshal would have
[1:31:16] put everybody in jail if they had caught
[1:31:17] him i used to go to the tabernacle it
[1:31:19] only holds so many people
[1:31:21] and and so he says now we can't just
[1:31:24] crush everybody in here
[1:31:26] and he said can you imagine trying to
[1:31:28] take you know seven seven services and
[1:31:32] cover those vials he said my he said
[1:31:35] because by this time now now the message
[1:31:37] is really people have realized what it
[1:31:38] is and they would come it would even be
[1:31:40] more than when he opened the seals
[1:31:43] and he says so he says what we've
[1:31:45] decided to do
[1:31:47] is he said beginning next week
[1:31:49] and he's going to he's that's the 11th
[1:31:51] and i think then he's going to come i
[1:31:52] think on the on the uh
[1:31:54] 18th i think and he said then we're
[1:31:57] going to start it on the 18th and he's
[1:31:58] going to start coming with certain with
[1:32:00] sermons
[1:32:01] trying to do god a service without it
[1:32:04] being his will and then he's going to
[1:32:06] come back uh the next service anointed
[1:32:09] ones at the end time and then he's going
[1:32:12] to come back with with another one and
[1:32:13] another one and another one and another
[1:32:15] one
[1:32:15] and and brother branham all through
[1:32:17] there
[1:32:19] what people miss
[1:32:21] is because brother branham didn't title
[1:32:23] it the vials
[1:32:25] but if you go in the and what we're
[1:32:26] going to do as a church what the lord
[1:32:28] has on my heart is i want to go through
[1:32:31] those sermons and show you where brother
[1:32:33] branham is pointing at at the madness
[1:32:36] and the craziness in the world and
[1:32:37] saying this is
[1:32:38] why because he released something in the
[1:32:41] air that's caused the world to go insane
[1:32:44] and i'm going to make the i'm going to
[1:32:45] connect all the dots for you
[1:32:47] i'm going to show you how that that
[1:32:50] those three unclean spirits like frogs
[1:32:52] you say all the vials are only in the
[1:32:54] tribulation well then how's how does he
[1:32:56] identify three unclean spirits like
[1:32:58] frogs as a trinity doctrine rising up at
[1:33:01] the end time to lead the church away
[1:33:02] from the word
[1:33:04] see
[1:33:05] how does he identify rock and roll music
[1:33:07] and worldly music and and show by the
[1:33:10] bible that the two things that will lead
[1:33:13] the world to armageddon
[1:33:14] is the trinity doctrine and rock and
[1:33:17] roll music
[1:33:18] and to the religious it'll be the
[1:33:20] trinity and to the non-religious it'll
[1:33:22] be hollywood motown nashville it'll be
[1:33:25] all of the all of that worldly
[1:33:27] entertainment that like a pied piper
[1:33:30] will lead the whole world to armageddon
[1:33:34] you think about that young person next
[1:33:36] time you jump in your vehicle and the
[1:33:38] devil tells you to hit that radio dial
[1:33:40] or pull up that to pull up that tune you
[1:33:42] just remember that's the same demons
[1:33:45] that came out of a bottomless pit that
[1:33:47] went into the earth and are corrupting
[1:33:49] the minds of men
[1:33:52] and it's leading them to armageddon and
[1:33:53] it'll drive you crazy as well
[1:33:58] and so so we find that brother branham
[1:34:00] goes from there he said now what we'll
[1:34:01] do is next weekend i'll take two sermons
[1:34:04] and then the next weekend i'll take two
[1:34:05] more and then the next weekend i'll take
[1:34:07] two more and he's going to cover seven
[1:34:09] services
[1:34:10] and all through there you're going to be
[1:34:13] hearing
[1:34:15] you're going to be hearing
[1:34:17] certain and i have went through and i've
[1:34:19] worked my way through the first two i've
[1:34:21] listened to them multiple times i'm
[1:34:23] going very slowly and i'm pulling out
[1:34:25] the references that tie back to say
[1:34:28] now i see why this is in the world
[1:34:30] because of this now i see here's the
[1:34:33] warning to us because this happened
[1:34:36] and brother bradham comes all the way to
[1:34:38] the end of he say yeah but he didn't why
[1:34:39] didn't he call it the vials but when you
[1:34:41] go to the last one when you go to that
[1:34:42] seventh one brother branham you know
[1:34:44] what he says he says to the church he
[1:34:46] says now he says now i hope you
[1:34:49] understand those vials a little better
[1:34:52] amen and people miss that because he
[1:34:55] never called it that but hit the burden
[1:34:57] on his heart during those seven services
[1:35:00] over covering over four weekends that's
[1:35:03] the burden on his heart is to teach on
[1:35:05] the vials to show you the judgments
[1:35:08] falling on the world
[1:35:11] to show you what's
[1:35:12] causing what's causing us
[1:35:16] to have a mass shooting in this country
[1:35:19] more than once a day now
[1:35:21] greater than once a day
[1:35:23] it's almost 1.6 i think it's 1.6 times a
[1:35:26] day this nation has a mass shooting of
[1:35:29] four more people killed not in not
[1:35:31] including the shooter
[1:35:33] this is why
[1:35:35] they go into elementary schools and kill
[1:35:38] first graders and fourth graders and
[1:35:39] seventh graders this is why they do it
[1:35:41] in shopping malls brother branham warned
[1:35:43] that this would happen he said the whole
[1:35:44] world's going insane this is why you
[1:35:46] have the polarization this is why you
[1:35:49] have uh uprisings and fights and riots
[1:35:52] and everything in the streets and and
[1:35:53] everybody's screaming for justice yet
[1:35:55] nobody wants nobody really wants justice
[1:35:58] you say well that's an aw that's a
[1:36:00] presumptuous statement no it's not the
[1:36:01] only the only one that's justice is this
[1:36:04] and nobody wants this so i just i don't
[1:36:06] tell you they they can carry the the the
[1:36:09] white supremacists can carry their signs
[1:36:11] the african-americans and brown people
[1:36:13] can carry their signs the the asian
[1:36:15] people can carry their signs but i'm
[1:36:17] here to tell you the only justice is
[1:36:19] here
[1:36:21] the republicans can rant and rave and
[1:36:24] the democrats can jump up and down and
[1:36:26] the independents can curse both of them
[1:36:28] and the atheists can run and the heathen
[1:36:29] can rage but here's the only justice
[1:36:33] here's the only truth here's the only
[1:36:35] peace
[1:36:36] hallelujah i'm so glad to be a part of
[1:36:38] the family of god where it doesn't mean
[1:36:41] that what color you are it doesn't mean
[1:36:43] that what nation you're from it doesn't
[1:36:44] mean that how you were born it doesn't
[1:36:46] mean that how you were cultured we're
[1:36:48] all the family of god in love one with
[1:36:50] another and marching to zion
[1:36:54] and we see the madness of all sides
[1:36:57] everything outside of the word is insane
[1:37:01] and that's where we are friends and
[1:37:03] that's where we've arrived to
[1:37:06] and so i want to take
[1:37:08] and i had two laid out today i'm not
[1:37:10] even going to get to touch them it's
[1:37:11] going to read you a couple of quotes and
[1:37:12] we're going to stop
[1:37:15] i got 60 seconds
[1:37:20] brother branham says
[1:37:22] in the revelation that was given to me
[1:37:26] listen to this
[1:37:28] in luke
[1:37:29] as it was in the days of sodom
[1:37:32] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:37:33] of man see at the coming of the son of
[1:37:35] man now watch close
[1:37:37] abraham there's always three classes of
[1:37:38] people on the earth believers make
[1:37:40] believers unbelievers
[1:37:42] now watch him as it was in the days of
[1:37:45] sodom now there were there was a
[1:37:48] unbelieving nation called sodom very
[1:37:50] sinful very bad
[1:37:52] and they had some believers down there
[1:37:55] the church natural lot his people see
[1:37:58] now abraham represents means church
[1:38:00] spiritual he had separated himself from
[1:38:03] the unbelievers
[1:38:05] and the make believers
[1:38:07] a very beautiful picture of the church
[1:38:09] today
[1:38:10] you know why that's a beautiful picture
[1:38:12] because the word church means the called
[1:38:15] out
[1:38:17] so that's why
[1:38:18] that if you're not separated from the
[1:38:20] world you're a fake christian
[1:38:23] i'm not trying to hurt your feelings i'm
[1:38:24] trying to wake you up you're a fake
[1:38:26] christian
[1:38:26] if if you have if you're still entangled
[1:38:29] with the world
[1:38:31] if you love the world or the things of
[1:38:33] the world in your heart
[1:38:35] that jesus said it's because the love of
[1:38:36] god is not in you
[1:38:38] see
[1:38:39] he's not insulting you he's trying to
[1:38:41] help you
[1:38:42] trying to get you to wake up and go wow
[1:38:43] i'm not as safe as i thought i'm not
[1:38:45] okay no you're not okay
[1:38:47] see you want you want to have that
[1:38:49] nature completely changed and so brother
[1:38:51] branham says
[1:38:52] that's what the church means the called
[1:38:56] out that's what the church
[1:38:58] is today are called out so
[1:39:02] that
[1:39:02] so now elijah
[1:39:05] the only one with the authoritative
[1:39:07] voice to do it
[1:39:09] elijah has now just disqualified
[1:39:12] every christian church in the world
[1:39:16] that's not living separate from the
[1:39:18] world
[1:39:19] he has invalidated their charter
[1:39:22] immediately under the word of a prophet
[1:39:24] this is why he this is why he could come
[1:39:27] and indict an entire generation and they
[1:39:29] didn't want to believe him and they got
[1:39:30] mad and they stomped out and it didn't
[1:39:32] matter brother branham says i do this in
[1:39:34] the presence of the judge
[1:39:36] amen
[1:39:38] and that's the one they couldn't dare
[1:39:39] deny because he brother branham could
[1:39:41] prove he's here said he said if if that
[1:39:43] pillar of fire brother said oh well
[1:39:45] if that's in question that can be proven
[1:39:48] and nobody wanted to speak against that
[1:39:51] and that's the same one he says now the
[1:39:53] angel of the lord he says i do this in
[1:39:55] the presence of the judge i indict this
[1:39:57] generation for the second crucifixion of
[1:39:59] jesus christ calling him your lord
[1:40:02] calling as calling him your husband and
[1:40:03] you're an adulterous woman who's still
[1:40:05] partying with the world
[1:40:07] and and and believing every kind of
[1:40:09] nonsense out of manmade systems
[1:40:12] so he says
[1:40:13] now it's time
[1:40:15] for the end time
[1:40:17] then there were three men that met
[1:40:19] abraham two of them were angels but they
[1:40:21] looked like men dust on their clothes
[1:40:22] dirt on their feet abraham said come sit
[1:40:25] down under the oak wash your feet i'll
[1:40:26] bring you a piece of bread
[1:40:28] then you may go on see abraham was
[1:40:30] looking for something
[1:40:32] that's what the church the believer is
[1:40:34] today
[1:40:35] watching for something he knew
[1:40:38] the time
[1:40:40] was growing close
[1:40:42] just like noah watching enoch when enoch
[1:40:44] went up
[1:40:46] noah knowed
[1:40:47] the storm was close
[1:40:51] see because there's an application of
[1:40:53] noah as the foolish virgin but primarily
[1:40:56] noah represents israel
[1:40:58] brotherhood said that taught that right
[1:41:00] on tape and so
[1:41:02] so enoch represented the bride taken in
[1:41:04] a rapture see and so of course it's a
[1:41:06] double application i'm not teaching on
[1:41:08] that today but but but it comes down to
[1:41:11] this friends that that these men whether
[1:41:14] it was abraham whether it was noah
[1:41:16] whether it was enoch whether whoever it
[1:41:18] was they were just like john they were
[1:41:21] watching the times they were watching
[1:41:24] prophecy just like daniel he was
[1:41:26] learning by books and he knew it's about
[1:41:28] time for us to go home
[1:41:31] we were only supposed to be here 70
[1:41:32] years and we are right pegging that now
[1:41:35] and daniel started setting everything in
[1:41:38] motion before before it before it even
[1:41:41] was going to come to pass daniel was
[1:41:43] already starting to be a voice and god
[1:41:46] was already moving in politics and
[1:41:48] anointing a heathen king to allow israel
[1:41:50] to go back home you think that king
[1:41:52] would have done that on his own volition
[1:41:53] nothing doing there's nothing in it for
[1:41:55] him but to let a rebellious nation who
[1:41:58] were historically known to be rebellious
[1:42:00] and to let them go back and build a
[1:42:01] fortified city are you kidding no what
[1:42:04] king would do that in fact is when when
[1:42:07] when sanbalot and all them saw what was
[1:42:09] happening they wrote to the king and
[1:42:11] said you know your majesty
[1:42:13] you do you know the history of these
[1:42:15] people you let them come
[1:42:17] and and and build a temple
[1:42:19] and they're zealots
[1:42:21] and they're building a wall and do you
[1:42:23] know do you not know that they're
[1:42:24] rebellious to to your forefathers and
[1:42:26] your predecessors
[1:42:29] and then
[1:42:30] the the king finds out says oh my
[1:42:32] goodness shut it down shut it down he
[1:42:34] issues an edict and quickly this is in
[1:42:36] the book of ezra yeah let's shut this
[1:42:38] down no i don't how did that happen who
[1:42:39] who gave them permission uh sir your
[1:42:42] majesty there's an edict from cyrus oh
[1:42:44] wait wait wait hold it hold it up what
[1:42:47] what did he say
[1:42:49] well he said they could go
[1:42:50] and he actually gave him money out of
[1:42:52] the national treasury and he even said
[1:42:54] if anybody interfered with them they
[1:42:56] should be killed
[1:42:58] and their families killed and impaled on
[1:43:00] stakes
[1:43:01] and their houses crushed the powder
[1:43:04] okay we better let them go
[1:43:07] because the
[1:43:08] the the laws of the medes and persians
[1:43:10] could not be countermanded
[1:43:12] even even even when a king
[1:43:16] gave up word he even he couldn't change
[1:43:17] it once it went out it became law it was
[1:43:19] unchangeable so god had already
[1:43:22] preserved them and it didn't matter
[1:43:25] that it didn't make sense to the common
[1:43:27] world it was god's plan it doesn't
[1:43:28] matter that you seem like a bunch of
[1:43:31] backwoods backwash hillbillies who don't
[1:43:33] know nothing you're actually the apple
[1:43:35] of his eye
[1:43:37] are you glad for that today
[1:43:39] listen friends we've got to be watching
[1:43:41] for these things
[1:43:42] now i've i what am i going to do next
[1:43:45] time when i continue on i don't know
[1:43:47] that'll be wednesday but i got to
[1:43:49] give up some of these other brothers uh
[1:43:51] getting getting there wanting to preach
[1:43:53] that's fine we love to hear them but i
[1:43:55] might be preaching wednesday i ain't
[1:43:56] giving it up yet so don't anybody jump
[1:43:58] in yet
[1:44:00] so we'll just have to see so
[1:44:02] uh i i'm unlike brother harold
[1:44:04] hildebrandt said one time years ago he
[1:44:05] said i don't really like how i preach
[1:44:07] and boy did i relate to that and he said
[1:44:09] i don't really like how i preach he said
[1:44:11] now i do like what i preach
[1:44:14] so i don't like how i preach but i do
[1:44:16] like an awfully lot what i preach
[1:44:19] because i love seeing the image of
[1:44:20] christ come so plain and being able to
[1:44:23] get other people to see that as a reward
[1:44:25] extraordinaire so
[1:44:27] so we're we're going to go forward next
[1:44:30] time and we're going to put up some
[1:44:32] diagrams and we're going to try to again
[1:44:35] in a elementary way just foundational
[1:44:38] make a few of the statements i've made
[1:44:40] and show you a picture and get it fixed
[1:44:42] in your mind
[1:44:43] because listen here's why here's why
[1:44:45] here's why
[1:44:46] by the time i get to those seven
[1:44:49] services and we start bringing out
[1:44:51] things that brother branham said i don't
[1:44:53] want any doubt in your mind that that
[1:44:55] was supposed to be said it's true and i
[1:44:57] need to obey it
[1:44:59] because i've i've seen by prophecy where
[1:45:02] we are and there's no more time to play
[1:45:05] around with it and now i understand why
[1:45:07] the world is so crazy and we're not
[1:45:11] amen
[1:45:12] let's stand god bless you all right i
[1:45:15] went five minutes over but you'll spot
[1:45:17] me that i'm sure
[1:45:19] amen you love the lord
[1:45:22] i feel very happy uh today i
[1:45:25] i wanted
[1:45:27] to get that out not too happy i don't
[1:45:29] have any water but
