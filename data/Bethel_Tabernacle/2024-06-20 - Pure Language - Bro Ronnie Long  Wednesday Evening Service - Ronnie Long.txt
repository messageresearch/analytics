tell you I sung this song I heard it a while back and I was out in uh Arizona and brother Dennis mcgary's wife um had gone over on a missionary trip with a friend of hers to Africa and her friend just felt a real desire and a real call to do something for the Lord but she didn't know what to do she was a podiatrist and you know that wasn't she didn't think there was a whole lot of need for that but she went over to Africa and found out most of the people over there where she was at didn't even have shoes they didn't have cars they didn't have any way to get around the only way to get around is walk and she just talked about the the great need that they had and what that the Lord had put it on that sister's heart to go over there and minister to those people in that way and she just said she' never been in services like that the people would walk for miles and come to a come to a place that didn't have electricity and there will be 500 people there and the preacher would be preaching with a flashlight and hardly any music but she said I've never heard Heavenly singing like I heard there amen I got to thinking about this song I heard it one time and maybe it'll be a blessing to you will life here is full of [Applause] trouble and we have burdens on every hand but someday y we'll never more W I'm going home to live with the Lord in a brand new land I'll be walking in new shoes

Lord maybe we know need to surrender there father Lord I pray that you would just move amongst us father and Lord let your let your life shine through us tonight father in the mighty name of Jesus Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah it's going to be back in the house of the Lord with you and we're certainly grateful for the opportunity to speak to you once again and we just pray that the Lord's been faithful and been with you through this week and amen amen if you have your Bibles turn to the Book of Romans the 10th chapter we thank brother Jason for the that's what I'm missing I knew I was missing something for the opportunity to speak here once again of course to bring readings from our home church and brother Wayne and the Saints Romans the 10th chapter the 8th verse but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith somebody say the word of faith Word of Faith the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with a heart man believeth under righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture sayith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the Jew and Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall we call upon him call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not yet all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who hath believed are report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen you may be seated tonight as God will bless this word to us I know that's a familiar scripture to us so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God uh tonight I just if we have a title uh would just speak tonight on a pure language like to speak on a pure language and so we read this in the scripture that our faith uh is the gospel which we preach right this is a Word of Faith which we are preaching and uh we can say a lot of different things that might encourage us in a lot of different ways but when there's a Word of Faith preached it it it actually moves mountains it actually changes situations and it's not it's not just mind over matter but there is an element of strength God bless you brother Joe it's good to see you there's an element of strength that comes from having faith in something that is greater than whatever you're going through right so we can have faith in in sickness and we can have faith in our disparity and we can have faith in our sorrows but that is never that is never going to amount to a victory but if we could have faith in something that will lead us out of those sorrows and out of those situations then that's where our faith should be planted is that right let's just turn to the Book of John the 8th chapter we'll take a little bit of time here in these scriptures if that's okay and I know uh they'll just probably follow along with me so uh the eth chapter and the 36th verse if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed and I know that you're Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you W and I speak that which I have seen with my father and ye do that which you have seen of your father right now my word had no place in you is not speaking to this church tonight but he's talking to a group of Pharisees that are claiming to be looking for the coming Messiah but there he is standing to them speaking to them there they are looking for truth and truth is actually speaking to them and they don't recognize truth standing in their midst and he said my my my word have no place in you I remember some time ago brother Brad that they had that bod's exhibit across you know United States and we went there to the bod's exhibit and went into the they actually have all of these cabers that were were taken so that you could see the how how Magnificent the human body is put together and we went into this chamber where the heart laid brother Joe I wanted to see the heart and I believe what the prophet said but I wanted to see it with my own eyes and there in that chamber that heart is dissected into just millimeters and sure enough in the center of that heart there is a place there there's a there's a little space about the size of a button and that place is not touched by your own blood but it's actually capsulated inside of your heart muscle I know there's probably some medical professionals but that's the way I understood it when I read about it online that there's a place there and actually your blood just circulates around it and there's a place within there that is not tampered and brother bam said that place was put there by God for his word to have a dwelling place and I'm thankful tonight that this scripture is not talking to me but I have a place within me where that word can abide you know brother B would say we did not come we did not be become seed by rebirth but we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken aren't you glad that you've been quickened tonight aren't you glad this word has a place in you they answered and said to him Abraham is Our Father and Jesus said to them if you were Abraham's children ye would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that had told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham ye do the Deeds of your father then and then he's he's telling them who their father is right you do the Deeds of their father then they said unto him we be not born of fornication we have one father even God and Jesus said to them if God were your father ye would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word now he's speaking to them in the same language they're all talking the same language right whether it's Aramaic or or or Hebrew they're all speaking the same language in this conversation but he's telling them you're not understanding what I'm saying even because you cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do now those some pretty strong words to to say to a group of Pharisees but he's telling them now what was the works of their father the devil right the The Works of the devil in the beginning was to hybrid the word to to to mix the word to mix it with an idea or mix it with theology The Works of the devil in the beginning was to hybrid that word to Eve right so that was the works of their father and the lust of your father you will do as he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth ye believe me not there some powerful words here he is telling them the truth he is truth he's the embodiment of Truth and because he's speaking to them truth they cannot believe him they can't take him at his word and because I tell you the truth you believe me not and which of you convince me of sin and and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God I'm thankful tonight that we hear God's words I'm thankful that we have a place there provided where we have recognized there's a greater Authority than us there's a voice of truth that has come into our life and we recognize that because there is a place prepared for that truth to abide in there amen and and I I don't think we should take that for granted tonight to say I I I just I just I recognize that we're not where we want to be Brother Brad we're not where we want to be but we're not what we used to be we're not where we where we want to be in our our vision but we're not where we used to be and I think we ought to just encourage enourage ourselves tonight in the word to say we see this as the truth and that's not for everybody else out there but it's to an elected seed that God ha for ordained before the foundation of the world that you might see this as a living reality I just want to patch you on the back tonight and say good job you're still here you're still serving you're still pressing on even though the trials have come but nothing can shake you from this truth because this truth was put there before the shaking time came before the burden came came before The Sickness came this truth was already deposited within you right but there's something to this understanding he's saying how come you cannot understand me and I believe everybody in here probably understands English and I know my English is broken but you understand the speech of what I'm saying right but to understand the meaning of it to understand what I'm really saying now I could say something I I'm sure down here in in South Carolina probably got some saying brother Brad probably got some sayings in Tennessee that he could say and I wouldn't know what he was talking about you know we go back down there in the holler and it's finer than frog fur and I'm I'm completely lost about what we're talking about now but you see there's a difference between just speaking the same physical language and understanding a language that's being spoken there's a difference between just the speech of what you're hearing and understand the meaning of what's coming behind it right and that meaning that understanding can only come by Revelation right so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word word of God I'm sorry if I'm moving a little fast but I got too much content so I'm just cutting through it that's okay hearing comes by the word of God so the only way you can really hear something is to understand it now there's a lot of churches that'll read a lot of scripture but are they understanding what they're reading but it takes a a select group of people to be given Revelation to understand what those words mean right we could say it like this it's a Heavenly language it's something Beyond just reading the text or reading the scriptures if it was just just reading the scripture uh brother Luther it would have been over 2,000 years ago because they had the same Scrolls that we have today so it's just not a matter of reading through this but for 2,000 years men have tried to understand what these words mean they have tried to put into a a revelation or an understanding or a reality about what these words mean but I believe we live in an age where all things are are are have come to pass all things are made truth all things have been made light there's a man that came that turned turned on the light to this word and now we can see it as it is and understand it as it was spoken in the beginning is that all right now now it takes some training to do this right it takes an ability to to to get under a tutorship man would say this in handwriting on the wall uh speaking of Daniel here and quickly being in a modern place the Bible said he called in all of his suers and astronomers all of the Bishops the doctors the popes the Cardinals and so forth and I tell you gentlemen I have given you the privilege to preach and to do what you wanted to do now interpret for me that on the wall I would not want to be in their shoes brother Joe now I've given you all of this leeway and now comes your time to shine there's a message on the wall interpret it for me but just as it was then so it is now they wasn't used to the supernatural they know nothing about it they didn't know how to interpret unknown tongues they know nothing about a Heavenly language they were dumbfounded they know nothing about it and they all just stood there remember this is the bringing in of the Gentile Kingdom and it has to come out under the under and it has to come out under the Supernatural and it'll go out under the supernatural but these Bishops and Cardinals and great doctors could not interpret the supernatural they know nothing about it they look through all of their books of art they could not find nothing that would compare with that and you see spiritual Things Are spiritually understood let me write that down spiritual things are spiritually understood and then they were all Disturbed and they didn't know what to do they didn't know what to do and they spent their whole life training for this moment right all the books amen all the books and all the schools if we started right now I don't care how young you are you could not catch up to them because they had spent their entire life and their father's life before them trying to understand the things of God but yet when it came to his Supernatural event they could not explain it they they did not know how to explain a paradox right there was something Beyond them that they could not put their hands on it because they couldn't with their intellect and and their their education explain what those words were they stood there dumbfounded but yet there was one among them that was not educated in the same schools that they were educated in but he was educated by a higher authority in those classrooms that they said in and he understood what was on that wall right that same King had dream dreams right and he had dreams and he said you know if you're really spiritual men you tell me what I dreamed and you tell me the interpretation of it they said that's impossible but yet there was a man there that was gifted of God that could do the very Supernatural among them and not only tell them what they dream but tell them what it meant it would take a Divine Prophet to do that it would take a godsent word Prophet to vindicate God's Authority in that age to do those works is that right so a a supernatural language is not just something that's openly spoken but it's something that only some people speak now we can teach English class tonight I'm not going to be the guy to teach you broken English as it is but how many in here are bilingual there anybody in here bilingual speak I heard brother Matt actually on the job speaking some Spanish to some some workers earlier this week and I actually I had to go look outside the door to make sure I had the right guy but it was in fact him speaking Spanish now if I brought everybody in here tonight and I said brother Matt's going to teach us how to speak Spanish I don't think he'd probably sign up for the job right because there's a native language and then there's a language that we can get by in right there's a language that we kind of dabble in a little bit and we probably say things backwards and they're probably laughing at us while we're saying it and you know it it it causes it causes a lot of frustration when you don't understand the language I don't know how many if we have a new some new people or some new folks off the street maybe and you start coming in here and it took a minute to understand what was being preached cuz it was all new to you right it was it was something foreign almost like what what does this mean and what do these terms mean and you see it's a language being spoken and and it's almost like a code right it's almost something that everybody next to you understands what's happening and you feel why don't I understand what's happening right because they speak a different language than you speak and it causes sometimes frustration or confusion I don't know how many of us have been overseas but if you go overseas and you're riding in the car whether the Matt you've been overseas and you're riding in the car and you're maybe driving to church you don't know where you're going cuz you don't speak the language they just told you to be in the lobby this certain certain time and there you are and then they pick you up and then you get in the car and they're speaking and they're talking but you have no idea where you're going cuz you don't understand the language and you just pray there's an interpreter there when you get there that understands English and they could be taking you to another country they could be taking you and you don't know if they hated the service or they liked it or if you're going to eat or you don't know anything about it because you're confused because you don't speak the language right and when you get back home you're so glad that you can hear in the airport well sometimes you're glad that you can understand the language that's around you say oh I'm almost home my they're speaking my language right there's the people that are speaking my language and if you get out amongst the wrong people for sometime it won't be your language at all and you won't understand what they have to say and you feel out of place and you feel frustrated and you'll feel why am I here but when you get amongst people that speak the same language that you speak you're almost home you recognize I'm back on my ground I'm back on my turf this is where I belong this is my native language and maybe you were born out in the World somewhere and you spoke a totally different language than you do tonight but when you came home there was a native language there that you understood the meaning of it you understood the power of it you understood that it had a a a superior authority to any other language out there it's the language of the word right this is where this is where Satan got into God to try to get into God's kingdom was to by division right n we could go we could take the time to read the quotes we understand it was nimrod's Tower of Babel right brother Ram says that's where denomination started because they all spoke one language going into that room and they all walked out every man speaking his own language and now you had fellowship with somebody you couldn't fellowship with anymore maybe it was your brother maybe it was your father maybe it was your sister but you walked into that room speaking the same language and by man's Wisdom trying to understand the of God it divided them you can go back and read your scripture to study these points but it Nimrod was the start of denominational Works in mankind because that's where division took place and that's how we recognize where the devil's at work he hates when brothers are in unity the devil absolutely hates when we can speak the same language in one Accord and in one mind so his his root cause is to cause us to divide amongst one another and get a get a get a get a an angle against this brother an angle against that sister I appreciate you brother Joe coming in tonight I know you're pastoring and to come in and just have that you tonight where we can we're we're together there's not different different isms and different schisms but we're together we should be United more than ever underneath this message and if we're still worried about this Doctrine or that Doctrine or that Doctrine all we're doing is fighting with each other and we're not fighting the devil we're fighting against this and fighting against that but we're not fighting against the devil and let me say tonight that your only enemy is the Devil Himself it's not you it's not you it's not me we are not each other's enemy but the enemy tonight we need to fight is the Devil Himself and if we're not we're not even at ABCs yet we haven't even come out of kindergarten yet we need to recognize that there is a real enemy and it's not your sister it's not your brother it's not me the devil is at work to recognize that that is his desire is to divide to kill steal and destroy that's his desire to recognize that is a long way it's something more than just reading it on a paper but it becomes a reality by Revelation so then Faith cometh by hearing hearing uh we'll skip through some of this he says that's the way it was issued in and it was condemned that head of gold was issued in by image worship and forced to it ended up in a supernatural handwriting uh a supernatural language that only Supernatural understanding could understand it let me read that again it ended up in a supernatural handwriting a supernatural language that only Supernatural understanding could understand it that's the way the Gentile Kingdom issued in and it'll go out the same way that's right by Supernatural Works Supernatural interpretation he says you know what I'm talking about watch you you'll notice this when you go back and listen to it tape this week how many times brother Braham says you know what I mean do you see it you see what I'm saying do you know what I mean now we understood the language he was speaking but did we understand the meaning right we understand the meaning of the thought he was teaching he says oh you know what I'm talking about the working of the supernatural oh how marvelous aren't you happy tonight you believe in the Supernatural oh yes you believe in the Supernatural now there's a language that comes with this Supernatural that not everybody else speaks right we can get into this uh brother man will call it in a quote the eagle language right and we could put ourselves in that chicken yard of that uh that barnyard where the chickens are all squawking around and chirping around and there's that odd duck in there that eagle that doesn't understand what everybody's squawking about because he doesn't speak that language now he can try to speak that language but it's not really in him to speak it it's not really in him to be involved with the chickens and it's not really in him it doesn't make sense to him he doesn't understand it I remember when I was just about this young man's age we went to a funeral of this sister sister that uh relation to this sister that was Catholic and the first time I ever been in a Catholic church and there we go into this Catholic church and they have this whole thing that's been programmed for like 2,000 years right since they started 1900 and something years and every funeral is done the same way well I have no idea because I've never been in a Catholic church so they know when to stand up and when to sit down and what to do and what to say and how to do this and I I'm kind of scratching my head brother Chris cuz the guy up there is not even speaking English he's speaking in Latin but yet everybody's knowing what to do I said surely not everybody in here speaks Latin am I the only one in here who doesn't speak Latin but they knew what to do because they understood the Motions of of of of where they were at right they understood this is the time for this and this is the time for this and this is this time they didn't understand what he was saying but they understood what they what they were supposed to do at that time right I just didn't fit in when do I stand up or when do I sit down I'm so confused but I thank God that I found a home where I fit in I thank God that I found somewhere that I understand and I doesn't matter if I'm on Q or on time or on key but I'm in the Supernatural language because I have heard from my theophany I have heard from another language in another land that told me this reality is going to change your body I'm waiting for it any moment any time it's a reality to me I believe just under one of these anointings one of these days we're just to step a little higher open the door we've never opened take God at a word we've never taken him at before and your mortal body shall be changed I don't believe it's a fairy tale I believe it's a reality I believe that's more sure than the ground I'm standing on tonight I believe that's more sure than this piece of wood tonight that God's word will never pass away heavens and earth will pass away but his word shall never pass away he that heareth my words that's us tonight you've heard it haven't you have you heard the shout come out across your life this is the word of God and this age saying come out of her my people we've heard it we recognize this this is not a chicken language this is an eagle language that's why we didn't get along brother Gideon out in the chicken yard is because we didn't not we didn't speak chicken we didn't understand that cluck brother B said all that clicking and clucking it didn't make sense to us why because we are from another land and in our land we don't speak chicken we're Eagles and how did we recognize that because when we heard that Mama Eagle cry there we were just thinking this was just it this was just the chicken yard there's got to be there's there's got to be something there's got to be some way out of this and then we heard the Mama's cry come across the Barnard I recognize it I hear it I understand it it's a supernatural tongue that cried over your life oh don't let the devil tell you that you just might as well give up you're already overcoming him by being here tonight you're already overcoming him by staying with the word oh don't let the devil take your ground you're still here you're still you would have given up but you're still here why are you're still here because something greater in you has brought you here above all of the chaos of the world you have every reason in the world not to be here but you're here we've seen too much if we wanted to go by man's laws I could have gave up because of that I could have gave up because of that I could have gave up because of that but you're still here tonight right because something in you is crying out something some deep in you is crying out for something greater and there's a deep responding back to you speaking the same language he understands your cry I might not understand your heart's cry but he understands it he understands that language and he speaks it back to you a supernatural language must be supernaturally taught right ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them but we are of God and he that knoweth God heareth us and he that is not of God heareth not us hereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error this is a powerful subject here because this is the spirit trying to divide the church church and hereby we can recognize the spirit of truth and the spirit of error by speaking the language of the word a word language no this is not just for the popes and the Bishops and the preachers it's a word language brought to the people that the people could speak the language of the word oh my when you're in a conversation with somebody you're just trying to make that conversation work right like you know you're trying to say you want this paint black and are you understand what am I saying this word right am I understanding that it's a bilingual conversation right but when you get out with a with you know when you get back in the hood and you're around all the homeboys you don't have to say much they just understand you you can laugh and they understand exactly what you're saying you can you can be back on Mama's table somewhere and and you and your brother can have a conversation that you know my mom used to say what are you guys laughing at we don't know but there's a conversation happening there because there's a relationship Beyond just what you see feel taste touch right it's a supernatural conversation taking place and that's why you feel more Kindred around certain people you feel like we we came from the same place we came from the same we came from the same section of Heaven We Came From the Same Cloth right you're you're from my hood I speak your language I understand what you're going through I understand that this world is not our home I understand that there is a des eration in a cry to get out of here there is no satisfaction in this world that will ever take away that desperation there's no drug no alcohol no sin no disparity trust me let me tell you young people you don't have to go through it it's not there the satisfaction is not there trust me when I say you don't have to go down that road you don't have to bear those scars the satisfaction is not there the only place true satisfaction exists is under the anointing of the hour when it's not you anymore but there's a supernatural being that has come down into your life that's what satisfies every old person here ought to be saying amen cuz you know that's the truth you know there's no satisfaction out there in the world why would we not fight for our young people and say there is a hope here in the word there's a place of Solace there's a place of Peace you don't have to go through those mind battles you don't going to have to go through that depression there is a place in the word where perfect peace exists you don't have to go down that road there's a satisfaction here there's a language that understands you here and you you may come to me you may come to brother Matt brother Joe and say I got these situations and this issue and maybe we don't understand you but there's somebody who does understand you I feel like it's the biggest frustration of young people today I just feel like I'm not understood I feel like nobody understands what I'm going through nobody understands the battle I'm having in my mind and then we isolate and then we draw away cuz we feel like we're not being understood and maybe as a man we failed you and maybe as a pastor we failed you but but but as a god he's never failed you as a god he's never not understood where you're at because he's been right where you're at he's walked through those shoes and he knows our heart's desire he knows the groanings that are within us and he's telling us come out of the chicken yard amen hear the eagle cry hear the eagle language he said oh but that eagle he just talked different he understood it different I thank God brother Luther because when I heard the eagle cry for 2,000 years men have debated about what this means about what this is but in my time in my day in my age someone came to teach me what this word means someone came to teach me how to speak a supernatural language and it wasn't just a a I guess is what this means but a Vindicated thus sayeth the Lord this is the mind of God this is what this means this is the absolute and if we don't have an absolute we're just absolutely guessing we've got to have an absolute in this word to know what he said and that it was for us it is for you yes it is for your situation this word has come down in your life to change your situation brother B want say this I'm skipping through some quotes but I hope you're you're you're tracking with me he says there about Jesus coming to the maniac of gadera right and there this man was tormented with spirits and there was a legion of spirits inside of him and yet when when Jesus went to speak to him those Spirits spoke through him those Spirits don't have a voice box but when Jesus came to talk to them those Spirits use that man's voice box to speak to Jesus right what do we have to do we recognize you're the Holy One Of God what do we have to do with you well those Spirits don't have a voice box Brother Brad but they used a man's voice box to speak the devil's language that's a powerful portion right here you go home and study it out where brother B talks about what the devil's language is oh I'm never going to make it oh this promise isn't for me I might as well give up there's too much I don't understand I've been hurt too bad I this sickness is too great I'm too nervous I'm too anxious I'm too depressed I'm too down in the dumps who's speaking that language it's not you why would you put a curse over your life you would never curse yourself and say I'm never going to make it but there's something else using your voice to say those words identify where it's coming from the Lord Lord didn't say that to you the Lord did not SE vindicate this message and bring it down in your age to tell you you're just not going to make it no that's the devil's language and the devil is using a voice box to to get his language out I say tonight we close the door to the devil and we say no more will I allow the devil's language to come forth out of these lips to come forth Out of This Heart come out of this mind when you have the thought you recognize it reject it it's not the Lord's thought it's not your thought it's from Hell he's looking for somebody that he can get to speak not me not today but we'll overcome him by the word the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth so I think this brother Matt if if the devil can use a man come on and the devil can use a voice box and the devil can so fill a man that that that man will just speak what the devil's word is then I believe we were designed for a purpose to be used to speak a voice on the inside of us and I believe if the devil can use a man then God can also use a man I believe if the devil can speak through a man then God can also speak through a man if we recognize where the authority of our speech is coming from a man can be so full of God till it would be God speaking through him you tell me how it can ucky Prophet would be able to speak the things that he spoke it would have to be God you tell me how a preacher up here service after service after service will tell you what you were thinking when you were by yourself when you were in your prayer closet you thought alone but you weren't when you were running from God and you thought you were alone but you weren't how could How could a man say those things to you he surrendered himself right brother Bram said the greatest gift that I have is surrender why because he knew there's something greater that wants to use my voice there's something greater that wants to use these lungs right we can turn to Joshua 1 but you know it be strong and very courageous that word do not be dismayed you know what dismayed means intimidated do not be intimidated by the Giants that are in your land because the word that I have given you is greater than the giants that are in your land do not be intimidated by whatever whatever the medical world calls it but the the word I have already given you is greater than whatever science will name it you have already overcome by the word that I have put in your mouth the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth right I believe there's some language changing taking place tonight that we're changing how we're talking because we've got to have a language change in order to speak the supernatural the word itself Supernatural through these eyes we understand the natural how could this be how could that how could that bone heal how could that bone set how could how could that heart be broken now you know there's probably some doctors or you know we we related to some or know some but is there any medical in here yes yeah yeah that's right you've never healed a bone in your life You' set one but the healing takes place inside right something had to be already programmed to heal that bone and we think well that's just that's just science but you tell me what doctor could come in and rewire a broken heart see there's more than just these physical attributes taking place but there's this Supernatural work nobody can go in and rewire a broken heart L it come from the one who made the heart see we're not just dealing with the muscle of the heart we're dealing with the thoughts and intents of the heart and no doctor can touch that but God alone has access to that Dimension and only he can come in and heal a broken heart I could preach till I'm out of spit and not fix a broken heart but just one moment with the King just one moment with the one who designed your heart and all of that ache and all of that pain and all of the wha ifs and the wise and the scars and just a can I get a witness tonight in just a moment just one interview with him can change it everything in your life can change all of the hurt all of the questions all of the heartache just one moment in his presence can take all of the questions away I know what I'm talking about because I've met that one I've had that interview where I could not explain my way out of a situation but meeting him changed everything about it I walked out a new man a fresh man why because I had an interview with the one who designed my heart as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so it's more than just this but there's another thinking capacity there's another understanding right he says when you're certain of anything there's one sound that you can be certain of and that is God's voice God's word is certain looking for a surrendered vessel to speak his language if somebody would just come and teach us how to speak this language if I could go to a class if there was an app there was something that I could just learn this language from what is the language of Hebrews 4:12 you ever thought about it how would brother brandom go to Sweden or Puerto Rico he can't even speak English and yet he hears in his language the thoughts and intents of their hearts so what what is the language of the heart what is the language of the word is it English English is not is not even close to being Superior enough to be the language of the word I thank God because I don't know that I could have mastered another language but I'm glad that the word came in proper English his hatte OES and don'ts and Carries because I understand that but it's not just confined to English it can't be how would he go overseas and all of these things come to pass but it would have to be a supernatural understanding a language of discernment right we could just stop here for a second and just talk about this the first two polls right first poll second poll but the third poll now in the second poll he turned and started Discerning the the thoughts and intents of the heart right there would be somebody come up and say you feel that presence there you feel that there oh this is where you're at you're here for your mother she's in Illinois who's telling them that what language is it coming down in you see with that gift of discernment was working there that God put there before the foundation of the world but then in another phase that discernment gift changed and it started Discerning another heart it started Discerning the Heart of Jesus Christ and telling us what Jesus Christ was thinking about you telling us what that what Jesus's heart really thinks about you and in that third pole face he was telling the church this is what God's saying about you this is what God feels for for you this is what God is going to do for you this is what God has promised to you what language was that coming in it was the language of a supernatural word coming down the changing of dispensations we're in the third dispensation where God's thoughts have been revealed I know the thoughts that I think towards you they are thoughts of good and not of evil to give you an expected and why because he already knows what's at the end and he knows what he's thought about you we're not guessing at this but a Vindicated word Prophet has come in our age to tell us what God Almighty thinks about us hallelujah we're not wondering we know we know it it's a Vindicated truth because it is not given unto you unto them to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens but to them it is not given but to you it's given but Tony it makes me want to shout why because in this life I'm nobody nobody would have thought me worth a dime nobody would have bet on me nobody would have put their money on me but God Almighty saw me where I am tonight and he put his reputation on me he put his name on me and he said they will overcome by the word of the Lamb what is it it's the language of the Lamb you've got to understand the language amen amen you've got to understand God's language is hidden in plain sight brother says you said you recall the beginning of the message of this book studying the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in future ages and then I mentioned this is out Exposition then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just an ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book cannot be revealed to anyone but a special class of people where you at church a special class of people it seems exclusive but it's election exclusive he's elected it this way a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know the Mysteries have been revealed the book is open the seals are broken it's been revealed we're not waiting on anything else what would it be if I spoke uh let's pick some crazy language that hopefully nobody in here speaks what if what if I what if I spoke uh Zulu it would do no good for me to preach this sermon in Zulu to you today because you don't understand it right it would do no good for me to greet you outside in Zulu why because you'll never greet me back the point to a conversation is two people speaking the same language that's why we love Fellowship so much it's two people speaking the same language it would do no good for me to instruct you how to speak a language that nobody else understands just ask a rocket scientist he'll tell you it's not fun nobody understands what you're saying why because they don't understand that language but God came down in a common people language that is commonly understood but he's not just wanting to speak it he's wanting a conversation brother he's wanting us to speak back to him he's wanting us and how could we yet speak back this heavenly language less we understand it l we understand what he's preaching to the church this is the age I believe when this this pure word is being restored if if the brothers would turn me to Zephaniah the third chapter ninth verse for then will I turn to the people a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one consent for then will I turn to the people a pure language somebody say all that they may all call upon the name of the Lord amen to serve him with one consent so when is this going to come down into into practical application when is this when is this prophecy going to be fulfilled in in our midst I believe it's happened already in this age I believe we're waiting for it to happen I believe this prophecy has become fulfillment in this age that we're living in that God has restored a pure language to the church not a language of confusion but a restored language not a new language a restored language not a reformed language but a restored language a language of Purity that only God himself would speak and would understand it's not written it's not it's not it's not something we can go learn at a class but it's by Revelation and Revelation only for two Thousand Years men have dissected this spent their lifetimes on one chapter and you think that we're going to figure it out just in a few years of study no but there came an instructor in our age you know there's a lot of languages that have gone extinct right that nobody speaks today anymore there's probably maybe some Native American language right here in this area that almost nobody speaks anymore because it's just going extinct right but you know there's one language that has gone extinct natur natural language that has gone extinct and been brought back to life and that's the Hebrew language the Hebrew language nobody was allowed to speak for years hundreds of years nobody was allowed to speak the the Hebrew language the only place you could find the Hebrew language was in religious text the only place you could find it was on Old Scrolls and only a few people could read it and nobody was allowed to speak it so what happened brother Luther it became a dead language it actually was verified extinct that there nobody that speaks Hebrew anymore so it's an extinct language exactly what the Catholic Church desired was for nobody to really read the Scrolls they wanted to go to the Latin book I'm sorry for stepping on some toes here but that's where it originated if you go back and do the history of it and they caused the Hebrew language to be extinct because Satan hates God's people Satan hates those people and so he caused their language to go extinct but do we hear Hebrew today yes because something took place that brought that language back to a speaking language and in the late 1800 there was a man by the name of elaser Ben Yehuda and he had an inspiration that he would restore the Hebrew language back to a practical language and everybody thought he was crazy brother Matt nobody thought he could do it but he had an inspiration from God this is God's people this is God's in in their world this is God's language we're going to restore it back and so we got some funding behind behind him and some other people to believe in it and and and at the turn of the century he began to get some backing into it and and and and knew that well the goal is not just for me to speak it but we've got to have a civilization that speaks it amen we've got to have a community that speaks it doesn't do just good for me to speak it but you know what I find interesting brother Matt you probably encountered this that when you go overseas that that what makes the best interpreter is one who can switch his thoughts he can think in English or he can think in Spanish and he can actually change his thoughts but you see there's a native thought that you think in maybe some of you have learned German and you've learned you've learned Spanish and you've learned different language but there's a native thought that you thinking and this man elzer knew that it we have to get a people that think in the Hebrew language and so he spent his life scrolling over these Scrolls and bringing this back and and and by inspiration taking this word means this and this word means this and bringing it into the modern Century right of all these things that weren't there when these scroll written and translating and just pouring his life out over going to school to be a linguist you know what happened he he had he had the vision we've got to have a civilization and April 11th 1909 he was funded to start T Aviv and they marched out from Jaffa I think it was a civilization of people set up some tents and that's where Tel Aviv in modern day Society began because a man man had a vision that there would be a community of people I need mechanics that speak it I I need I need shop owners that speak it I I need I need moms that speak it I need everybody's thoughts to change to this language and in this city we will only speak this language all right all right April 11th 1909 I thought that was pretty powerful Gideon how long does it take for an anointing to go across the world just a few days April 11th 1909 Tel Aviv began I believe that we are the first and the natural comes later right the spiritual happens first and the natural comes later the word Tel Aviv is found in the scripture right it's the White City it means the new old land a Hill spring Tel aiv and the scripture is found in Ezekiel the thir chapter where he eats the book it was the city the port city where Solomon imported all of the materials to build the temple The Cedars of Lebanon came in through Tel Aviv in the scripture all of those the the the stones that the builders rejected and all of those materials came through that Port City of Tel Aviv right if you go back and in the scripture and that's where the first second temple were built was through the port city of Tel Aviv we find that in Ezekiel 3 then the spirit took me up and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing saying blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place this is coming from Tel Aviv so Tel Aviv begins to thrive and begins to it P continue to grow and and there's communities moving in and families moving again now they're seeing a generation come in and they're teaching that generation how to speak Hebrew language and in 1921 it became an official Township you write these numbers down and go back and read them in 1921 it became an official Township and in 1933 Tel Aviv became an officially recognized city in the world in 1933 as I was with John the Baptist so shall I be with you what happened in 1933 to us a restoration came our way something came from another world and came down to where we were and it wasn't an extinct language anymore but it taught us how to speak a Heavenly language my message will forerun the coming Christ there's too much here I'm not making this up it's Vindicated by somebody way greater than my intellect this message has been and thoroughly Vindicated to come down and teach us God's language how could you speak a language of Faith let you know lest you know what God's word says about it how could you say how could you speak to a mountain lest you speak Mountain but somebody would have to come and show you the way this is how it's done I will forun this by telling you how to speak it and generations will come after me and their thoughts their thoughts will begin to speak this language hallelujah thank you Jesus we've arrived we're here I don't speak denominational clock I understand this language I speak the language of truth I speak the language of understanding it's a supernatural understanding that has come across my life Hallelujah why would I worry when Giants come calling my name I don't speak their language you Lord I've been given another language an interpreter has come and told me how to understand this language oh friends we could take the time to go through this you know the Redemptive names nobody nobody connected that with healing what a teacher had to come the spirit of Truth had to come why do you not believe me I truth but you see there was no place in them to receive it but in you thank God but in you there's a receptor built in you that when this flashed across your life let me say brother Joe in this age it was more than just that camera lens that was flashed across but that Pillar of Fire also flashed across my life and I have heard from a supernatural voice he did not just come to teach me how to argue and quote War back and forth it taught me how God speaks to understand God is his own interpreter so then who came in this age it would have to be the one who wrote the language to teach you how to how to speak that language for 2,000 years men have guessed at this but we are speaking the language of the word tonight I've heard I heard a voice what voice the language of the word has come down into this age to teach us the authority of where we're at can I say this we're in adoption language what language was Joshua speaking when he told the son to stand still it was way more powerful whenever natural language he was speaking but there was a language of faith and recognition and of adoption Authority we've gone beyond just just those three gates but we're walking in adoption land and we have been commissioned to speak don't cry speak don't Smite it speak speak speak I'm a man under Authority when I say go they go when I say move they move I recognize you're a man under Authority if you would just speak the word it shall be done who is it that's talking to you it's not some man but God has come down into your situ ation instead if you could just speak the word amen you're man under Authority I'm a man under Authority if you just speak to this situation it shall be done the very same hour the man servant was made whole right a language of Revelation a language that we're not now let me make something clear we're not all to speak with tongues right Bible makes that very clear we're not all to dream dreams we're not all to prophesy those things are for the edifying of the church and they're given to those that God can God can use right and every man has given a portion according to his faith correct okay doesn't make me less because I don't speak in tongues can I just share a personal testimony we we okay you know what I I kind of thought this for a long time I thought well if I really spoke in tongues and you know I I'd probably feel like I have the Holy Ghost well then it happened and you know what I still had the same complex that I didn't have the Holy Ghost that I had before it happened is that okay that's good brother then I thought well if I was an interp I'd have it you know what Brother Brad I had a I had a I had an instance where I spoke in tongues and interpreted exactly what was going on in somebody's life without ever knowing them or knowing their name and I still had the same complex of not having the Holy Ghost so it's not measured by those things it's measured by the word now I believe in speaking in tongues I believe in dancing in the spirit I believe in I don't don't take away what I'm trying trying to preach here I believe in the moving of God I say let God move I say let the spirit flow through the pews I say stay from the back to the front let God move don't bind him down with your theology or Creeds or what abouts you know what I think if we would just let go of ourselves enough I believe there's more gifts and potentials laying in the church than we recognize I believe the gifts that you're wondering about they're already in you but you've got to let yourself go long enough to let God move in that gift you think it's easy to get up here and preach no you've got to let yourself go so God can move well same for you in your worship you've got to let yourself go and let God move we okay but the devil too long has bound down the church to say you've got to look like this no Paul makes it very clear we don't all do those things this is not the language of what I'm talking about but what we will do is say Amen to the word right what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost well there's a lot of answers I could give you but one of them is say say Amen to the word I don't mean you have to be as vocal as me but your heart has to respond to the word and say that's nothing but the truth that's nothing but the truth you tell me brother Chris what language was it that hadti W could speak in that little cabin way more powerful than English language but something more more more authoritative than just English came down into that room let's just start here what language do squirrel speak something greater than just English but an authority a word of authority a a word of restoration a word of Resurrection a word of creation we'll go there it's in the word that's the language that we're being taught here not just how to out out teach a Baptist what good is that going to do anybody but the language of a lifechanging word is laying right here in this book if only we could look at the pages and understand it but yet he came in this age and showed us the way to speak this word now I've used my lips to speak a lot of things in this life a lot of things that I should be held accountable for but thank God for grace and thank God he taught me how to speak another language that changed my perception of who I am who you are who you are who everybody is why because I'm now seeing it through the lens of the word a Heavenly language the old things passed you're a new creation can I say you're New Creation tonight that means whatever you did yesterday doesn't count when did your mercies renew this morning you're a new creation your Mercy's renewed so what you thought about this before is not being held accountable to you I can prove it I can prove it to you because in that little room had he right used a language that was more powerful than her broken English but she said I claimed the lives of my two boys and brother brandom said that they were there in the corner making fun making fun of what was going on in the C and yet in that moment when the holy spirit moves there ain't no power strong enough to stop it when God moves on the scene I don't care where they are what they're doing how high they are when God moves there is no power great enough but he will have his seed he will redeem his bride he will redeem them back oh but they blasphemed they were laughing in the face of the prophet a greater language than your natural understanding but a supernatural language well I bless God I know the way that predestination works well apparently we don't well it's got to be will and it's got to be this is a supernatural language and God is not bound by what we understand or what we think or what's got to fit in our jigsaw puzzle but God is God and he will do the miraculous amongst us because we have been taught to speak miracles amen I was at a little church four or five years ago and the pastor came up there was a there was a prayer line going up and the pastor came up he said I want to pray for my children I have eight of them and and they're and and four of them are serving the lord and four of them are out in the world and I want to call them by name he said I want to start with my oldest one he said I want to call his name before the Lord we prayed before the Lord he said I don't know where he's at this was in a little village in Alaska the only way to get there is a little jump plane if it's snowing you can get there by a you know if it's snowing you can get there by a jet ski but you're not just going to roll up to this Village he said I don't know where he's at I don't know where he's at right now this Village is only about 800 people he said but I am commissioning the Lord and he spoke words that were greater than any man's words they weren't worked up they weren't puffed up he just said I commissioned the Lord after my son and I went we we we rejoiced with him we praised with him and as a man we know there's no way we could do that and there were there some more people came for prayer and more people were coming and brother Matt I just I just uh we leaning back and we were just worshiping the Lord you know how it is in that anointing and just praising the Lord and all of a sudden this sister who was the pastor's wife began to cut loose and she was doing somersaults around the room screaming and I saided go bless God she got a blessing but then I noticed that cut through the back door there was a young man that came in and he stumbled in he was drunk he was red-faced he didn't know where he was and he leaned his head against the wall and he began to sing heavenly father I appreciate you wow and I just thought it was some town drunk but then I recognized that was his mother that was his father's prayer brother Matt not 20 minutes after we had prayed for that young man he came in the back door don't tell me God doesn't know where they're at and he doesn't know their name he doesn't know just where to find them and how to get them back into the fold yes I went back to that church just last year that man is still serving the lord Faithfully attending the church four or five years later don't tell me God can't do it because I've seen him do it you know the testimony of Justin wear brother Wayne was preaching there at that at at that church brother Tims church and there that young man came that sister came through right said I want to call my brother it's time for him to come home and through their United fa brother Tim and brother Wayne and the brothers began to pray and that little girl's Faith reached into another realm greater than the English language and that man woke up in his bed somewhere was terrified he missed the Rapture scrambled to church ran over stop signs his truck never moved again after that night but he made in the house of God in his pajamas and surrendered his heart to the Lord and now he's a standing man in the church at evening light Tabernacle is he not can you witness it don't tell me God God can't do it he's already doing it don't tell me God can't do it I've seen him do it I'm watching him do it this was not 60 years ago this is [Music] today if God before us then where are all his miracles you're looking at one you're looking at a Mama's Prayer you're looking at a prodal return you're looking at a miracle restored don't tell me he can't do it because he can I was in Mexico last July and we had a service and at the end of that service some people came up for prayer and this mom came up for her son I didn't understand what she was speaking but we spoke the same language Hallelujah we ENT into prayer for her and she said I claim it in the name of Jesus and walked back to her seat we we started man the Holy Ghost poured out they turned into like brother Bram said a dancing party there's people dancing all over in the spirit and just rejoicing these people don't have money they don't have they don't have the things that we have but doesn't stop them from praising the Lord you know what it gets rid of a lot of The Prestige when you don't have the things that oh somebody's watching me on camera or somebody's watch we just need to get rid of The Prestige and let God be God and let God operate in his house is this not his house and then I noticed this little lady went over in the corner and she was hugging this man and the pastor came over to me just tears in his eyes he said that's the boy 12 years he's been out of church 12 years years and he came 30 minutes after we prayed for him all the way on the top of a mountain outside the top of the city where we were having church at this school and made his way in there also drunk also staggering around and surrendered his heart back to the Lord his mother hugged him for the first time in 12 years don't you tell me God can't do it cuz I know he can it's a different kind of language it's a language of faith and this m message came down in this age to teach us how to speak this language devil will tell you your language is defeat it's anxiety it's fear the devil will tell you have to live that way all your life devil tell you panic attacks are normal I'm here to say the devil's a liar I'm here to say the devil has no Authority over the people of God I'm here to say the devil has no right in your home in your thoughts in your voice in your lungs I say give no place to the Devil he's got no right but the word will teach you how to speak a language of Faith it'll teach you how to speak a language of victory of overcoming power of healing of rejoicing the this word will teach you well I don't know how to worship this word will teach you music players could come this word will teach you well I'm not sure what's okay and what's not this word will teach you amen this word will teach you how to speak Mountain this word will teach you how to speak squirrel God Amen this word will teach you how to speak to storms tell me do Colorado speak different storms than Jerusalem storms they speak different different languages this word will teach you how to speak storms how could you say to a storm this try it next time a hurricane comes through without the inspiration of God you tell that hurricane to stop and see if it obeys you but this word is greater than the hurricane this word has supreme authority over the storm over the snow this word is greater we're citizens of a different kind of Kingdom a kingdom of Victory a kingdom that knows no defeat a kingdom that has never lost one amen oh you don't understand I may not understand but he understands well this person passed on before they had the Holy Ghost what service was Sharon Rose in when she received the Holy Ghost are we okay taking a little liberty here but what service was brother bram's daughter in when she received the Holy Ghost but yet she was the spokesperson when he got there Oh Daddy isn't it wonderful isn't it wonderful oh now all of a sudden God's not in our little box but he's a god of authority of supreme deity there is nothing that can govern the power of God but what you will let him do in your life he will do above all that we could think or ask and I can think and ask a lot of things but he will do more than that if we can just surrender ourselves and say God I'm ready for you to be God in my life I'm ready for you to be God of my mountain of my struggle I'm ready for for you to be God of my prodigal I'm ready for you to be God of my home and of my marriage I'm ready for you to be God of my my little ones I'm ready for you to be God of my finances I'm ready for you to be God over my situation I'm ready for you to be God over my church and my songs and My Worship I'm ready for you to be God in [Music] it ready for God to be the operator in the room had enough of man's ways and of what I think is okay I want God to be the Supreme Governor I know brother Matt brother Jason feels the same way we want God I saw it on the door assistant pastor Jason Watkins why because we want God to be the pastor of bethl Tabernacle we want God to be the the one who meets with you when the couples meet with the pastor we want God to be the one who grants no man can give you the Holy Ghost but God Alone we want it to be God God in the organ in the guitar God in the drums in the piano god in the Clapping God in The Sound Room yes God can be God in the camera room he could be God in the parking lot he could be God wherever you're allow to be God I think it's time we let go of ourselves and we say Lord You're your ways are higher than mine your thoughts are higher than mine your ways are beyond my understanding yes Lord Lord above all I trust you wonder we could just say that as a church tonight above all I trust you God I trust that your ways are above man's ways if I could have worked it out I would have done it different but God I thank you that you did it your way God I thank you that you did it the way that you saw fit before the foundation of the world you did it the way that we were supposed to go because every footstep is ordered of the Lord Lord I Thank you for the trial I thank you for the struggle I thank you for the heartache why because his ways are
