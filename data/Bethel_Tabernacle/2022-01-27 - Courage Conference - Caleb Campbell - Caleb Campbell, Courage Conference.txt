surrender this all to you now in the precious name of jesus christ amen glory to god amen glory happy to be in the house of god tonight it's such a privilege to be here happy to be here tonight got some technical problems but that's all good um i don't know good yeah okay good yeah awesome all right good to go um all right let's open our we're gonna take a text from acts the fourth chapter the 23rd tonight they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which has made heaven and earth and the sea and all that is in them who by the mouth of thy servant david has said why did the heavens rage why did the heathen rage and the people imagined vain things the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his christ friends we're seeing here right now that in acts chapter 4 they have a they have a burden upon their hearts and they're gathering together in one accord just like we're here tonight we're gathering together and they're lifting up their voice to the lord and it says in verse 27 for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined to be done and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto their servants unto thy servants grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word amen friends may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you can take your seats tonight just such a privilege to to be here and to be a part of this atmosphere tonight we just come up here and what a wonderful atmosphere i really draw strength from being around each and every one of you and seeing your wonderful faces um although you know when i can't be here i am thankful for streaming but when i wow there's just nothing like being at church amen there's nothing like it oh brother jason called me a a couple of months back number of months back actually and um he told me he said brother caleb you know you you know you've preached a few times and you know i really i i really feel like this is you know led to the lord to do so and he said so just any time that you have a burden on your heart you just just let me know and we're going to go forward with it and i thought wow i don't want to do that i would way rather be out there with you all uh as jeremiah so originally said it in jeremiah 20 9 then i said i will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name and that's that's what it says but his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones glory to god and i was i was weary with forbearing and i could not stay friends that's that was fire shut up in my bones so here i am amen thank god good last time we spoke to you we were we were talking about learning how to be completely submissive to the the leadership of the holy spirit i think that that's a a a vital thing in every believer's life and it's not just a subject you take as a text it's a lifelong thing that you have to live we went through some examples and scriptures with gideon and paul and with brother branham just showing that no matter how much of a veteran christian or how new of a christian that you are in your walk that finding the mind of christ and surrendering to his will and everything is an everyday occurrence it's it's not even an everyday occurrence it's an every minute occurrence i mean we have to every everything that we do we need to find the mind of christ and it's in times that that we don't know his mind that we're learning the most from it the times of waiting is where i find that i learn the most amen we have to search for his direction at every avenue you know as a christian it's like coming to a crossroad but as believers that crossroad happens every day for each one of us an everyday experience and it's absolutely vital not just in the big decisions like we were talking about last time but in every decision amen god really is the best teacher he'll never he'll always be training you in situations and you don't even know that you're in training brother branham picks up a quote uh or picks up a in spiritual adoption 1956. he said we can't look for sympathy and be sympathized with too much we must listen to child training of our father he knows what's best amen he knows what's best sometimes we say when the gospel is being preached oh thank you brother oh i'll just go to my church oh yeah i'll just believe it this way but remember the holy spirit knows best amen it knows how to train you sometimes it takes the stick to correct you you must remember god made the child trainer for the chur for the church and he loves the father and he'll always point to the father amen it doesn't always feel so good when it's time for a little bit of correction in our lives i know that i've been at times in my life where i've been at a crossroads and needing to make a decision and and the lord needed to correct me in something and it didn't feel so good it doesn't always feel good but i always want to be corrected amen and we should always as the holy spirit led christians we should always heed to that correction in everything that we do um in everything that we say and everything that we think we have to he allows us to go through certain tests and trials you know we can't we thinking about back in the book of job you know he had a uh building built around job he said have you considered my servant job and satan said i can't get to him you have it's too hard he said you can do everything but kill him god god literally will allow these things in our lives to make us stronger amen friends so that we can reach our full potential as believers and i don't know about you all but i really want to reach my full potential as a believer amen glory to god i don't want to be drug along the finish line holding myself or anybody else back i want to go forward amen tonight we're going to take a topic on the courage conference it came to me when um i was listening to a a sermon by the prophet on conferences he preaches it many times but i just wanted to be to begin tonight by exploring a really familiar story a sunday school story that we're all very familiar with but i want to go through it so it's fresh in our minds amen and we don't have to turn to it if um but it's in the book of esther so esther won this was a time when king hasawaris was was at the uh was at the throne he was the kingdom uh the king of a great kingdom at the time and the king was having a banquet a great feast in his throne and wanted to show off the queen we're just going to go through just a quick synopsis so it's fresh in our minds he asked the queen uh at the time which was vashti um to come before him to so that he could show her show her beauty to his you know to his kingdom and the king got together and and she refused that commandment she refused to go before him she humiliated him so the kings got together the king got together with all of his counsels and and discussed what uh what the law was on this matter and um and and what should be done and if there anything can be done or what i need to do and the wise men knew that if if the king didn't do anything that the circumstance would set a terrible precedent in the land for the whole kingdom and throughout and then so chapter two is when when esther is mentioned um and the law was set that vashti was was dethroned and that the they would they needed to go into all the land and find a fair young virgin sought for the king and it was a process it was a process that they had to go through they were set underneath the king's chamberlain hagiai or haggy h-e-g-e is how the king james says it and how whoever was it to please the king that would become the queen and we find that esther finds favor in the sight of the chamberlains she finds favor in the sight of the king's servants and all things were given to her it says that all things were given to her speedily all the best things were given to esther she was put at the front of the line esther we go on to further to read and we find that esther did doesn't tell anybody that she's a jew she kept that a secret her uncle mordecai told her that you know you're a jew you don't don't tell anybody this so when it was esther's turn to go before the king you know after the process the purification process she she only took and this is a beautiful thing and it can a whole sermon can be preached on this but it's not the subject tonight she only took what the king's chamberlain suggested somebody that was so close to the king that knew exactly what he what he liked what he favored she only took that all the other all the other women they took they took these nice long robes and these nice necklaces and this nice perfume but no the only thing that esther wanted was what the king liked what what was pleasing to the king amen and that's i mean it's beautiful but we're gonna we're gonna keep going amen in chapter three we find the conspiracy of of haman um haman was came to be known as the second in the kingdom he had such a hate in his heart for mordecai and the jews and we find that we find out because the reason that he had this hate in his heart was because that he was a descendant of the amalekites which were israel's uh enemy for generations so he was an enemy of the queen amen but he didn't know that at the time he persuaded the king that that there was a he persuaded the king that the jews were or that there was a certain people that weren't following his law and his statutes correctly so he tells the king that you need to set a law in order that the all of these people be killed amen so the king obviously in his you know he had a lot of advisers coming to him for a lot of different things he had a lot of of responsibility so when somebody comes before the king and says that you have somebody that doesn't respect your throne he obviously gave him authority he gave him the authority to go ahead and send the order further so he was sly haman was sly he was cunning in his in his deceitfulness amen just like the devil is sometimes amen haman said it in order and he sends out the decree out to all the kingdom and all the jews that they were to be killed on a certain day at a certain time and that all the women all the men and all the children all of the kingdoms of the medes and persias and verse 15 of chapter three we don't need to turn but it says that the people were perplexed they had one of their own people in the kingdom now they knew that that esther was a jew she still hadn't told anybody but but they knew that she was a jew and there was a there was a great uh a great they were on a great mountaintop they were having a mountaintop experience they had somebody in the kingdom to but what happened is that the enemy came in and now their lives are on the line not just not just their family's life not just their their food and their shelter but their whole entire lives were on the line amen and we find out in chapter four that esther finds out about what heyman had done and she doesn't know exactly what to do her people are going to be slaughtered in a matter matter of weeks and the only authority able to stop or or to do anything about it is the king amen but the queen at that point in time could not enter into the inner court without being called amen so you know it's it's fresh in our minds and we're just thinking about that story we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna shift a little bit but i want you guys to keep that fresh in your mind that she was desperate and she had a need and it was about time to call a conference amen i want to pick up in acts the fourth chapter in verses one and one through four and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captains of the people and the sadducees that came upon them being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead they laid hands on them and put them in hold they put them in prison until the next day for it was even tied it was late at night how be it many of them which heard the word believed and the number of men was about five thousand this is what king the king james version describes as the first persecution since the since the ascension of jesus back into heaven and we don't have to turn there but i want to just take a background of what what led up to this series of events and what was taking place in acts chapter 3 peter and john filled with the holy ghost we know it happens at pentecost they were filled with the baptism of the holy ghost they were all together gathered together in one accord and now in chapter 3 peter and john are just walking they're walking through the gate and a man that had been there his whole life ever since that he was able to go there was at the gate and the gate was called beautiful and he was crippled and he was asking for alms he was asking for money and peter and john came up and it says that he laid every every single day there he was begging and laying but peter and john they were filled with the holy ghost and they said unto this man verse six silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give unto thee amen friends such as i have i give unto thee peter took him by the hand he didn't just say the word and then expect it to happen he took him by the hand he lifted up his hand and said and it says that his ankle bones immediately received strength amen praise god this and this is what they show in the king james i really love how they have this study study bible but the this was known as the first apostolic miracle since the ascension of jesus glory amen verse 8 shows the man leaping and running amen friends when we get a healing in our lives when we have something has happened that that has infected our lives for years and years i'll just say right now glory to god i'm able to drink coffee and sleep sleep flat at night because i don't have any stomach problems anymore because god healed me of that he healed me of that amen friends when i first gave my heart to the lord i was having heart problems i didn't know what was going on just palpitations he healed me of that he delivered me of that each one of us could have a testimony each one of us do have a testimony tonight that whatever it is the the the the devil fought us with or that god allowed in our lives to oh to give us overcoming power we we feel like this man because he lived his whole life like that he lived his whole life not being able to stand and not being able to walk and just crippled if i had if i wasn't able to walk if if i couldn't if i couldn't physically do anything for myself and a man came up to me and said in the name of jesus christ you are whole and he took me by the hand and he raised me up and my ankle bones i watched them it was just crooked and i washed him straightened out glory to god i would be praising the lord i'd be jumping up and down i'd be looking crazy that day glory who wants to look crazy with me because i'm healed we're all healed amen they it caused a great uproar it caused a great stir among the place they said that they were in the place called solomon's porch which is a very interesting fact because it was it's really cool solomon's porch was actually what solomon had built years and years ago and it had been destroyed and then rebuilt and now they were in that place called solomon's porch and the man went around and they it ran together into the porch and it caused an uproar in acts 2 and verse 41 it says that about 3 000 souls at that point had been baptized and given their hearts to the lord because of this experience with this man and his ankle bones and he's just running and praising god it says that in acts 4 4 that about 5 000 souls were given to the lord that's 2 000 souls that gave their heart to the lord because of something that happened because of what jesus did glory to god it caused it caused peter to just have a fire in his bones he had a fire oh he just had something burning inside of him he just has started to preach the gospel it says that he started to preach in verse 13 that the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus now this is axe sermon i like plagiarizing out of the word this was a sermon from another guy but i'm plagiarizing it out of the word the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus whom ye delivered up and ye denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer instead to be granted unto you and he's just preaching at him just preaching to him preaching at him and he said in verse 15 and he killed the prince of life whom god hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses repent ye therefore and be converted because your sins so that your sins may be blotted out when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord verse 22 for moses truly said unto our fathers now this is just snippets from his sermon a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto your brother and like unto me and him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you and it came to pass in verse 23 that every soul which will not hear the prophet shall be destroyed from among the people 2 000 people gave their hearts to the lord that day because of this sermon that he preached and it caused it up great uproar so we get to chapter uh we get to chapter four in the first four verses of what we opened with and we see that obviously the sadducees and the captains of the temple were not happy at what was going on friends the devil is not happy when we have victory they our enemy hates it when we have victory but when we've got the holy ghost and we're healed it doesn't matter what he says or what he thinks we've got the victory glory to god and they spake under the temple and the sadducees and they were grieved it says in verse two being grieved that they taught the people and they preached through the resurrection through jesus the resurrection of the dead amen friends i was preached the resurrection of the dead and i gave heed to my jesus and i gave him oh glory to god and they laid hands on him and they put him in hold until the next day for it was even tied friends they put him they put him in prison they beat him they put him in prison and the next day it says that they brought him they brought them before the council friends a lot of times i look at this story and i so identified with it because what we're going to notice here what we're going to see is is that from chapter 3 to chapter 6 there's mountaintops high mountaintops wow and then there's valleys and there's low valleys i mean low valleys you go from preaching a sermon and watching 2 000 people give their hearts to the lord to being beaten and put in prison and brought before a council because you just because for what for what reason am i brought before this council peter says for what reason because i have because i preached in the name of jesus because i had a man because a man was healed because for what reason and it says that so just think about put your put your uh self in their shoes for a minute these were these were apostles but they were also men and women just like us and they fought the same battles that we're facing and they had ups and downs just like us and there was mountains and valleys amen friends we can go through that and it says in verse eight so in verse six and seven and that he went before him and in verse eight it said that he was filled with the holy ghost again and ye rulers of the people and he preached to get into him and he says be it known unto you to all the people um we're get we're going to paraphrase a little bit so you don't have to follow up there but be it known unto you all to all the people of israel that jesus the name of jesus of nazareth hath raised christ from the dead this is the stone which was set at not of you builders which is become the head of the corner amen and neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby ye must be saved amen friends it said that they spoke in the next verse that says that they saw the boldness of peter and john and that they perceived that they were unlearned ignorant men but they perceived and they marveled that they had been with jesus friends i want to have that attitude i want to have not that attitude i want to have that that persona that when somebody sees me they know that i've been with jesus wherever i go with whatever i do however i act i want them to know that i've been with god because i can't do it by myself it says that he had to be filled with the holy ghost in verse eight he had to be filled with the spirit he was already filled with the spirit why was he filled with the spirit again because we are go through mountaintops and low valleys glory to god amen so when they saw that they were they marveled and they they they saw they were ignorant men and they marveled they took note that they had been with jesus and uh they go it goes forward and and he just keeps preaching between verses uh 13 to 22 and they went before and they uh beholding the man was healed they could say nothing against it um 16 and verse 16 sorry i was trying to find it they could not and it says that we cannot deny it friends they there was nothing to deny someone everybody saw that man and his ankles and his feet and his crippledness at the gate of beautiful every day for the last 10 years they 15 years they watched him every single day they couldn't deny the fact that now he's jumping and praising the lord they couldn't deny the fact that two 2 000 more now 5 000 had given their lives to god and received the holy ghost they couldn't deny that fact but peter and john answered and they're preaching to him for but verse 20 we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard i can't speak unto you friends i couldn't come up and come up and say anything to you if i didn't have an experience of jesus christ amen friends brother jason dimar sent a wonderful verse to me or a wonderful quote he says that people can have experiences of everything we you can have an experience of anything but it's until you have the experience of jesus christ that it becomes a reality to each one of us and that's and then and only then can we express jesus christ to others you can't be a witness if you don't have an experience yourself glory to god amen friends i've had an experience who's with me amen friends and if you haven't you can have one tonight amen so they we cannot speak but the things that we which we had seen and heard and when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish him because of the people because of the five thousand because of the people that were there they knew that if they could if they sent him to prison if they stoned him if they beat him anymore they knew that it would cause an uproar or cause a riot and so they just said go on your way but they threatened them and they said that you're not um i don't know what we whatever verse it was they said you're not allowed to speak they threatened him they said that they threatened him you are not allowed to speak in the name of jesus anymore amen now friends i want to pick up where we started i guess i didn't i didn't start with acts one through four but we started with verse 23 i want to pick up at verse 23 now and i want to imagine we see things when we read the scriptures we read it in a linear way it goes up and then it down and then up and down right but when i when we look at it we need to read between the lines a little bit amen in verse 23 it says in being let go peter and john they were walking along the road that day and they just i mean two chapters earlier they just had a mountaintop experience they i mean they watched a man be healed in jesus name this was the first healing since jesus ascended so that jesus wasn't even there to do the healing but jesus was there to do the healing amen he was living inside of him they had the baptism of the holy ghost which is jesus amen so they watch that and then and then peter filled with the holy spirit preaches to him and then more 2000 more give their hearts to jesus and i can just imagine him walking down that day and i mean they were beaten they were blood was probably coming off of their eyebrows and they had just been before a council and the council was threatening them not to preach jesus anymore friends put yourself in their shoes for a minute they were in a low valley right after a mountaintop experience they were just they were in a low valley oh my goodness i can so identify with those low valleys and those high mountains just the other day i was in a low valley oh man the devil was so dude this service isn't going to bless anybody you aren't this is it why are you even doing this and oh and then every everything it seems like any in any inspiration that i thought that i may have had it would just go out the window and the devil was just winning and oh my goodness i was in a low valley friends and the last month i've been in a mountaintop because i've been oh my goodness wow wow but i was down i was down in the valley and i just was i mean i was just you know i beaten and tattered and that's what that's what the devil does man he just he drags you along in any any way any way that he can he'll just drag you along and and they're just peter just to put yourself in their shoes for a minute peter and john walking down the road just gotten out of prison just got beaten bruised up and now what it said that they preached with boldness just like seven verses earlier but where's that courage now where's that boldness now what's going on friends they they had to like like what the holy spirit does we have to constantly go back to god i mean it is an every day every minute thing all the time what did they do and a lot of times we get it we find ourselves in those situations where we don't want to get around people we we feel down low in the spirits i thank god for my wife she's her name says it all she's joyful and she's correct she just always encourages me and i'm thankful for that she came home when i was in the low valley and she just smiled real big and just gave me all kinds of encouragement and it just really was awesome anyway so praise god for a wonderful wife amen but so friends they were in this low valley and a lot of just put yourselves in their shoes again and we're just in this valley and we don't want to be around people you know we even talk ourselves into not going to church we're oh we i'm just going to be a hindrance to the service oh who's felt like that before oh i just i'm not gonna it's not gonna i'm not gonna bl it's not gonna be a blessing to me my mind is just at work and it's just i'll just you know i'll just maybe stay home and i'll stream and i'll just even email just you know whatever the case is but what did they do they they knew that there was a key there was something that that that they had experienced before that they knew that if they just went about their separate ways if peter just went to his house and john just went to his house and they just you know well lord you know prayed by themselves they weren't gonna be able to break through it we have we're a body amen we are a body and a body i can't use i can't drive with no arms so i probably could but i i can't i ca i can't drive without eyeballs right i can't there's certain things that i can't do without parts of my body and each part of god's body is vitally important we are all vital and important i don't care what your gift is you are vitally important from encouragement to anything you are vitally important in what you do and how you say whatever it is you are vitally important it says that they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them friends i just want to i just want to i just want to show you something here that brother branham picks up in conferences and it was uh 1960 says that peter and john walked out of jail that morning out from a con out from the conference and they went over and said you know what i believe we better call a conference so they was just going to call another conference what's called the axe four conference see where the inspiration comes from in acts 4 they all come together and they were telling different experiences they called a conference and they got down on their knees called a conference they wanted to call on god and ask what to do should they retreat what must they do should they preach divine healing should they compromise what should they do what must we do friends that's what we need i mean we have a we are a body tonight we're having a conference tonight what must i do how can i be encouraged for tomorrow how can i how can i be an encouragement to the body of believers what must i do we have to call a conference before god friends i just want to turn our minds now back to esther and and just to show a little bit of drama esther finds herself in this situation she was just living just living on a mountaintop she was a jew and she had to she was taken from her family or from her uncle and then she was brought before and she it was possible that she wasn't going to be queen and then she was maybe never going to go back to her family and there was just all these possibilities but what happened she she was chosen amen she was chosen to be the queen we're chosen to be the bride she was chosen to be the bride amen but she was just living on that mountaintop she she was favored above all above all and chosen to be chosen to be queen of the greatest of all the land at the time but she found herself beaten down and the only place to look was to god she didn't know what to do in just a few short weeks her people were going to be slaughtered and the only way to help was to ask the king but if if she went before the king the law was that she would be killed uncalled so she called a conference amen she said mordecai go tell all the jews fast for three days and i and all my servants will fast too they we don't have to bear the burden alone friends we are we have a group galatians 6 2 says bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ if it's god's law i want to know about it so we have to fulfill his law and bear one another's burdens that doesn't just mean and i've done this i've been guilty of it but that's that doesn't just mean saying i'll pray for you brother that means that we take the burden from them if it's a hundred pounds we take it with them and it's 50 50 now we we put ourselves in the shoes of what that burden is happening we are like i said we're all a body but we're all so different we all have different struggles we all have different past failures we all have different things that we're struggling with and one may not understand the other but if you just stop for a minute and put yourself in the shoes of that other person and say look i don't know what exactly you're going through brother but ah man just tell me about it and i'll just i mean if you tell me about it then i can learn how to pray for you better i wanna i wanna know how to pray for you better brother i want to i want to learn i want to bear your burden with you i want to go forward to christ with you glory to god not many times how many times do we say and we just you know we need to call a conference tonight friends i want to transition now back back to acts 4. sorry i'm kind of going back and forth but it says that they went to their own company they went to their own company in verse 23. where are we at tonight we are in our own company glory to god we are in our own company they had brothers and sisters that went to the church with them that sat among the same pews that they sat on and they remember having an experience just just a few weeks earlier and they they remember that brother brennan picks it up and so what did they do they caught they remembered back to a previous conference that they had brother ben picks it up and he calls it the pentecostal conference glory to god and they climbed them up those little outside steps and went into the upper room where 120 people gathered little grease candle burning they didn't eat and drink for 10 days waiting what's the return of the conference it was quite a long one and they had 10 days waiting and after a while the returns came oh yes what happened when the conference return came they were all in one place with one accord and suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a mighty rushing wind it filled the room what they were sitting cloven tongues sat upon them like fire they were all filled with the holy ghost he just quote in the scriptures here friends and they began to speak in other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance this was the returns from the general's headquarters the holy spirit was to lead the church not man-made dogmas but the holy spirit that was a pentecostal conference and they remembered back to that conference now so they didn't go back to their own homes they needed to gather together they had a burden at stake they said you can't preach in the name of jesus you yeah i don't care how bold you thought you were you can't do this i don't care what you thought you you won in your battle last week whatever trial you're going through whatever you think that you won last week you it's still here you're still fighting it you're still facing it oh glory to god they called they remembered that conference we don't we know exactly how long the acts the acts 2 conference was the acts 1 conference with the pentecost 10 days we don't know how long the acts 4 conference lasted it doesn't have it doesn't have it in the scriptures but we do know that 10 days it lasted the last time so what's what's another couple of days what's another couple of hours however long it took they prayed together they lifted up their voices together and they all got in one accord and they started praying and it wasn't just oh lord thank you for this day thank you for all that you've done for me amen no this was they were burdened friends they had something on their hearts they needed to preach the holy ghost they needed to do it with courage they needed a little bit of a courage boost tonight friends i don't know if you needed a little courage boost but i sure did coming into church i just need a little bit of courage to press the battle just a little bit longer dude we just got a little bit longer just keep the courage we've got each other to bear one another's burdens with each other glory to god amen now being let go and they went in and brother branham says a quote and i just i just want to stop here for a minute i just want to show you just any birth i sent this quote to um uh these brothers today any birth is a mess i don't care if it's in the pig pen or if it's in the decorated hospital room close your ears any birth is a mess so is the new birth it's a mess it'll make you do things you didn't think you could do but out of that death and out of that corruption comes forth life and no seed can bring forth life until it's dead and rotten amen and out of that rotten mess is when nothing else is left to rot it it's the only is the it's the only it's only the life that lives i only want my life to live i want to be rotten i want all of the rottenness in me to die out friends if you haven't died out completely if you haven't had that pentecostal experience if you pentecost isn't an organization pentecost was an experience that happened at the upper room glory to god pentecost is my experience that i had when i received the baptism of the holy ghost pentecost is real have you have you not died out to christ do it today friends and if you need a refilling of the spirit it says that they were refilled with the spirit friends we have times in our life where we're so low and just so drawn down but if we just go forward and we just read scripture to show us that we can be refilled on the daily you can be refilled he was just refilled three days ago he was refilled yesterday now i need to be refilled today i can't live on yesterday's experience although pentecost was an amazing experience that they could look back to he couldn't live on that peter and john and all those others they couldn't live on that pentecostal experience so they had another pentecost to experience in acts chapter 4. glory to god i just want you to know that having the holy ghost is the most important thing you can do in life you it is the absolute everything everything else doesn't matter unless you've got the holy ghost so tonight if you don't have it if you don't know that you know that you know then get it right now friends glory to god imagine if they had an unction to wait 10 days why not wait just a few more days here at the ax4 conference oh i can just think about peter and john walking back that day oh they couldn't bear it alone oh but they had friends they had a group waiting for him friends oh they broke out they broke through oh i can just imagine them sitting on their knees praying to the almighty god father lord i need deliverance in this these two the two were the only ones peter and john everybody else it said though they weren't praying differently they they buried they beared that burden with them they got down on their knees with them whatever it is that any of us are going through we need to bear that burden with the people we need to step in with faith and say glory to god whatever it is oh we can we can oh we can just pray through tonight oh praise god we can pray through tonight praise the name of the lord it says that in verses 29 verses verses 31 and when they prayed when they prayed the place there was shaken when they assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness they spoke it with courage oh glory to god i was standing right outside that door and i just said lord god i can't go out there but i need your courage i need your boldness father give me courage to go out there and preach the word of god and what did he do he gave me courage glory to god he can give us courage tonight oh glory to god and the enemy threatened both the enemy in this story was haman the enemy in this story what um excuse me glory to god it's good to be in church the enemy in this story was haman and the enemy in this story was the sadducees and the captains of the council glory they both had their mountain tops i don't know why i correlated these two stories but glory to god they both had a mountaintop experience but then they both felt the depths of despair friends we've we've both been we've all been in both situations many times i mean sometimes in a day i can go through both the amplified bible says in verse 4 or 4 and 24 that they raised up their voices together and said oh sovereign lord having complete power and authority it is you who made heaven and earth and the sea and everything that is in them i love that sometimes we just need to get together and raise our voices to the king friends i was feeling this was a couple of weeks back maybe maybe even a month or two ago i was feeling down i was feeling low it wasn't even like i i was going through something crazy i just was at work and you know everybody has battles when they go to work they've got to face spirits they've got to face you know they've got to face this evil age amen and i just was you know i went into my room and i just was like this is man i just need some encouragement what did i do me and my cousin he's like my older brother we we marco a lot he gave his heart to the lord last year and man it's been an encouragement and i just just feeling down low in spirits and i just started watching this little it was it's like a video app and i just started watching his video and he just was telling me just this little just this little testimony about how one of his daughters was you know asking he gave his heart to the lord and and one of his daughters was just asking you know how how she could be you know that how do i how do i witness how do i how do i how do i do that how do i spread the gospel he had the christian radio going and i just i just sat there and i was just in a chair and i just uh my whole atmosphere completely changed everything i mean anything i wasn't even thinking about work anymore i wasn't thinking about anything except for this man glory to god this little girl has a desire to want to spread the gospel oh my goodness and what an answer to prayer i'm not a father yet but i can just imagine a father and their their little girl that's not serving the lord just coming to you and just saying oh how do i how do i do this how do i do this maybe maybe we've got you know you know daughters or sons or you know nephews or nieces or whatever that's not serving the god serving the lord we can enter in with them we oh we can enter in with people like that amen friends glory to god and a little bit of encouragement goes a long way glory to god hebrews um hebrews 10 25 let's find it real quick it's before james anybody he did hebrews 10 25 not forsaking the assembling of others together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more so much the more as we see the day approaching so much the more friends i mean that that to me that little just video chat that i have with my cousin and and he him and just in a different state to me that's just as to me and it's assembling together to this is assembling together get you know calling somebody just if you have a burden on your heart for this person text them say oh man i'm praying for you i don't know what's going on you know you know you need to talk you need prayer it goes a long way encouragement goes a long way glory to god we have we have some of the same conditions tonight some of us need courage to press the battle to go into tomorrow man i know i do glory to god brother brother diggs was preaching uh last last week week and a half ago whatever he was just saying and just how liberating it is when you when you shout to the lord you know that song it's just shout to the lord and we sing praises it is liberating friends i'm telling you when you free when you break when you break forth i mean going back to you know acts they do you think that these these brothers and these sisters do you think that they were just on their knees you know you know lord and you know this and that no they were shouting they were glorifying god they were lifting up god i mean they were lord we need you we need you i mean they were dancing and shouting everybody's got different personalities everybody's got different ways of worshiping maybe some of them were running around or you know oh my goodness i'm going to come down here some of them were running around like you know jumping up and down and some of them were jumping up and down glory to god some of them however however it is you worship but worship however you can because it can be liberating and once you do it you can't not do it but you need to have an experience to match i read a quote today however high you jump your experience need to match how high you jump so whatever however high you're jumping now if you're going and giving god glory you need to have an experience to match it tonight friends glory to god glory to god you think a few more days you know 10 days is nothing just a few more days you know we were i was having a conversation uh she told me never to mention her up here so i'm not gonna look at her but i was just having a conversation with with my wife a couple of weeks ago maybe a couple months ago and love you okay and um i just hopefully this can get give us some encouragement tonight to be we were just talking about how to be witness how to be witnesses how to be bold and you know we read how you know even the apostles i mean these were these were men peter brother matt told i just so enjoyed his service like we last week amen everybody and he just was talking about peter and just how you know he had such a different personality he he was he was angry at first and then it you know but he was changed when he when the holy spirit got into him he changed but peter but but all of these disciples they walked with the lord i mean these were people these were men that literally walked with jesus i mean they walked with god in flesh for three years i mean for years they did this and then three chapters later four chapters later you know they're discouraged wow they were discouraged friends they got discouraged just like we do we still have that same spirit but they i mean they walked with the lord but but they still got discouraged but what did i mean what did they do they they constantly i mean if you read the book of acts i mean constantly they're just going back to the lord they're going back to their experience they're they're getting refilled i mean constantly and the lord will train you along the way we talked about that a little bit earlier and what goes from and just bringing back that conversation you know at times like when we're when we're witnesses when we're witnessing it can be difficult and at times it can feel uncomfortable you know to bring up the lord and and it's just it can be hard i mean everybody faces that and it's they don't know how to do it and you know you know it's a process we go through a process amen and you know what did they do they asked for courage they prayed for boldness to be filled with the spirit and i just was i was at home i don't know if this is gonna help anybody or or not and i don't know if it made a difference or not but i'm just gonna i'm just gonna i was at home today and i was studying for this sermon and i was like well i don't want to just go up there and preach and and and not be able to live what i'm preaching not be able to live a courageous life and not be able to pray and ask the lord to give me courage and as i was as i was thinking that i started i was like on a i was jogging trying to get some of this energy out and i was jogging and i just came across these guys that i don't even know if they live in my neighborhood or not there was three of them and they were fishing at a pond and i just i just i was so compelled wow it was like man when the holy spirit's tugging on you it's not just a little you know draw you know little string it's a i mean it's a rope i mean he's pulling you amen and he was pulling me friends and i just kind of kept going and i was oh man okay lord sometimes that's what we do friends we you know we we keep going you know that that voice that we gotta we gotta heed to that voice and i just kept going and my neighborhood is a circle so that's difficult to do so i came around the other side and then it just was stronger and stronger and there's a way if you come in my neighborhood like this the pond is here and i was coming back this way and then there's also a path that goes around it like this and i started to do that and i just oh no can't do that and i almost got home i'll admit sometimes we you know we almost we almost get home we almost don't heed to that call but i just i felt compelled and so i went up to these guys and and not to not to try to boast or anything like because it's not like i went up there and i you know i baptized them right there but i but i there it was a pawn that would have been that would have been a great thing to do but i just asked i said hey man i would hey hey guys i was running and you know they were you know intimidating they were bigger guys and i just said hey bro or hey guys like you know i just was running i felt really compelled to come talk to you about the lord and you know uh you know are you all christians i didn't know what else to say are you all christians and they all kind of looked at me and you know at first when people you know when you're when you're approaching people they don't know what you're going to say they don't know what sometimes i mean especially these i don't know if they live in our neighborhood maybe they were thinking well man this guy needs to uh he's probably wanted to ask me to leave or something i don't know but i don't carry fish in that pond but i i went up and i just asked them that and they kind of were taken aback a little bit and they were like well one of them was like well yeah i am a christian and i was like whoa oh that praise god i just want to know i would let you know you know i'm i'm ministering tonight and you know i'm preaching on courage so i just thought i'd maybe come over here and try to and then i started stumbling over my words a little bit but i'll maybe give you a little bit of courage or get some courage whatever you know whatever and i just i i didn't know what else said i don't know i mean sometimes it's difficult you know in situations it can be you know it it can be difficult but if you just if you just ask the lord man the whole way out on i was on that little road i was on i was just walking and i was like lord i really need some courage right now please give me a little bit of boldness to go up to these guys and say this and you know and you you plant seeds as christians and you're not the one who waters those seeds god waters those seeds okay so whatever whatever i said to them i don't know if it ever will come at fruition i i may never know or you know whatever you say to somebody whatever however you're living whatever it is that you however you can be a witness and you know the way you dress the way you the way that you speak the way that you don't speak however it is that you however it is that you witness you you just gotta pray for the courage and god will give you direction on how to do it amen probably looked really silly but i don't care and i probably look i probably look really silly standing up here and jumping and shouting but i just don't care i want to be about my father's business i am about my master's business he is my master and it's all for his glory i'm not up here trying to give you some great sermon no it's all for his glory friends it's all for his glory esther back to our topic esther prayed and fasted and her conference lasted three days she said fast and pray for three days and at the end of the three days i'll go before the king okay she build up the courage she had to build up the courage friends and she had to come to a place where it was it was time and she she was desperate we have to come to a place where we're desperate for deliverance we're desperate for the baptism of the holy ghost we're desperate for our family we're desperate for it friends she was desperate and what happened she went before the king after that three days after that she built up some courage and after she had all of the jews in the all of the land fasting and praying not eating and just doing everything that they know how to do as christians as as i guess they weren't christians at the time but you know as as as the jews as god followers amen and what did he do he granted her grace he held out the scepter and it granted her grace glory to god and all that and she didn't even tell him the reason she built up all this courage and then she came before the king and then didn't didn't even tell him the reason but now to get on another point we have to be careful and i don't want to say the word careful we we have to check our approach to the king amen i need this i need that or you know lord i need delivered i mean okay you need delivered what if what have you done have you have you prayed have you have you fasted have you showed that you're serious we we need to watch our approach friends we need to have a humble approach man if you listen to brother branham every time he gets up there and just he uses the word reverend i love that word reference lord let us be reverent give us reverence tonight give us respect lord i don't i i we respect the lord so much he is he is our everything he is our all he is all everything to us amen friends he's everything nothing else matters but god and i respect him i i reverenced him she reverenced her king she respected him and she said she said what is it what what what is your request up to half of the kingdom tell me she said oh great oh great king i request you and haman to come tomorrow for a banquet that i prepared and um she prepared the banquet and they came before and they're eaten they eat and they're you know their bellies are full and they're happy and you know the king obviously it's on the king's heart on the king's mind you know what is it esther what what is it that you i mean up to half the kingdom brother jason preached on this years ago it's not 50 like not up half the kingdom not 50 percent of the kingdom up to half the kingdom the whole kingdom but like my half and your half together amen it's up to half the kingdom you tell me she said oh king she's building up that courage and she's building up that courage oh she said oh great king i request you and haman to come tomorrow for another banquet that i prepared oh friends we gotta we gotta prepare banquet sometimes we gotta we gotta get on our knees sometimes we gotta break through in prayer sometimes it takes time sometimes it to to break through like they did at pentecost to break through they did like they did at acts it does it sometimes it doesn't happen especially in today's day and age we want everything to happen right here right now it doesn't always happen and you know i'm glad that it doesn't happen because i've learned and i we say this this is all against all human nature and we learn the most when we're waiting and i'm so glad for those times of waiting glory to god i'm so glad because i've learned so much in those times i've learned to just put my trust fully in the lord jesus to put my trust fully in him because there's nothing that i can do i can't i mean god knows he's infant in his wisdom he knows everything he knows the end from the beginning he knows exactly what we need and he knows that it's going to happen anyway so we just have to place our trust in him in every situation amen and she said she prepared the bank with that that second night but this time she had the courage she had the boldness i can imagine you know after that first night she probably went to just dramatize i don't know i i can just imagine after that first night she probably went to mordecai again said uncle the first time praying worked let's pray let's get together again tell them to fast again i need some courage some boldness this is paraphrase i don't know this isn't paraphrasing i don't know if this happened i just dramatize him i need some courage some boldness in how to address the matter and they came back the next time the next day and haman you know think in the world of himself the devil think in the world of himself just thinking that he's got you trapped in every direction heyman didn't even didn't even know she was a dude but thought that she thought that thought that he had had all the jews were going to be dead mordecai was going to be dead and he was second in the kingdom i mean everything to him was just so grand i mean he was coming to a banquet and he thought so highly of himself that that the queen would only want the king himself and haman and the devil sometimes gets in that place in our lives where you know we you know maybe have a trial that we're going through or whatever and we i he she said just like the devil just thinking that you had that he has trapped you in every direction and the king said to her this time i'll just just listen the king said to her what is your request my queen glory to god what is your request she said i and my people are to be destroyed to be slain and to perish i mean she was desperate desperate i'm desperate for you lord and the king replied who is the enemy who is doing this and what happens next is so beautiful and it spoke so heavily to my heart that i just i i took it i took it from and i'm plagiarizing another another brother brother paul lafontaine actually said this in one of his services last year sometime but it spoke to me it was so beautiful she exposed the enemy in the presence of the king glory to god sometimes we have to come before god if we've got something monumental i mean this was monumental sometimes we need to be reverent we need to watch our approach and if it's so great at trial if it's so great a burden in our lives we actually have to take it before the king and bring the enemy into the presence of the king and expose him glory to god he's exposed tonight whatever it is that you're facing he's exposed he was exposed oh glory to god hallelujah oh if we have we have something that we're facing tonight that needs exposed that we have to overcome to glory if we need the holy ghost if we need a refilling glory we're together right now we're tonight in one accord gathered together let's make it known in the presence of the king and expose the enemy in all of his threats glory to god they exposed the enemy oh glory to god they threatened you remember back to acts 4 those sadducees and those pharisees were threatening back oh but they exposed to their enemy if you read back down in acts 5 we don't have to turn but in acts 5 40 through 42 the apostles were beaten again they came to the same trial being persecuted for the namesake of jesus christ thrown in prison before account brought before a council beaten worse this time bloodier this time oh brought before a bigger council told not to preach the gospel in the name of jesus told that you're not going to overcome this trial said that you can't do whatever it is that you said that you can do oh but this time the conference was different this time the conference they they they rejoiced lord jesus i'm rejoicing tonight they rejoice that they were able to be counted worthy of the oh glory to god we're counted worthy for the suffering of jesus christ whatever we have to go through we're go we count it worthy because my precious jesus he was beaten and he was scarred and he was drugged down in a cross on the back of oh and he was hung up there oh this is my this is my precious king oh he was hung up there oh so if we can go through a little bit of trial if we can go through a little bit of beat a little bit of beating whatever it is whatever it is oh i want to do it with glory i want to do it this time they had a different
