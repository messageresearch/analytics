[0:00] as i was as i was driving this morning
[0:02] an inspiration struck me almost wish i
[0:04] could preach it today
[0:06] but
[0:07] you know
[0:08] during um
[0:10] world war ii which was actually the
[0:12] second woe in the book of revelation
[0:14] had to come world thought that they
[0:16] think they know what that's about it was
[0:18] it was only about god getting israel
[0:20] back into their homeland
[0:22] and preparing them for messiah but one
[0:25] of the things that was notable when i
[0:27] started thinking about all everything
[0:29] that we overcame as a team and i'm not
[0:31] going to go down the list today but just
[0:33] trust me the list is long and there were
[0:36] a number of impossible situations that i
[0:39] just didn't see how it could be done
[0:41] and yet
[0:42] in ways i cannot explain to you if you
[0:45] needed me to i couldn't explain that
[0:47] certain things happen and they just
[0:49] happened and i don't even know how they
[0:51] happened but they happened and it went
[0:53] off and here we are
[0:54] and i thought about how that during
[0:56] world war ii and the allied and axis
[0:58] powers clashing
[1:00] and you know it's it's it's notable in
[1:02] history the invasion of normandy uh when
[1:06] the allied forces under dwight
[1:08] eisenhower stormed the beaches
[1:10] at omaha and utah and sword and the
[1:13] different beaches and the axis powers
[1:15] were dug in and i mean they were dug in
[1:18] and they they had almost every kind of
[1:21] weapon imaginable to stop the allied
[1:24] advance because what the allies needed
[1:27] to be able to do was establish a
[1:28] beachhead if they could get a toehold
[1:31] and get landed and marshal their forces
[1:33] then it was then it was as churchill
[1:35] said it is not the the end the beginning
[1:38] he said it's not even the beginning of
[1:40] the end he said it is perhaps the end of
[1:42] the beginning because from there they
[1:44] could march in through france and cross
[1:46] through belgium and into europe and into
[1:47] the rhineland and and and move axis
[1:50] forces back
[1:51] but
[1:52] but but the axis forces knew that if
[1:55] they can just stop them from getting
[1:57] that first initial beachhead landing
[2:00] then they can they can either prolong or
[2:02] maybe even force the allies to just try
[2:05] to have a peace and i thought about how
[2:07] the enemy has taken this first youth
[2:10] camp this very first one for bethel
[2:12] tabernacle and we're just a small
[2:14] seaside church
[2:16] 120 couple people counting youngans and
[2:19] and and there was really no way to do it
[2:21] and the enemy has fought us and fought
[2:23] us and fought us but god in this first
[2:25] year has established a beachhead
[2:28] amen
[2:31] and from here
[2:32] i believe we can push on to the coming
[2:34] of the lord i i sent you i hope you got
[2:37] it i sent you a little message from my
[2:39] heart to yours uh on the uh on the camp
[2:42] text i hope you got that if you did if
[2:44] you didn't ask somebody to show it to
[2:46] you just a few is because that's what
[2:48] he's got and covid erased all of that
[2:51] but fortunately he had a super wife who
[2:53] remembered it all
[2:55] amen and sister amy was like no this is
[2:57] what you're going to do no this is what
[2:58] we're going to do and and i'm here to
[3:00] tell you and sister rachel my my own
[3:02] daughter-in-law and all of the other
[3:04] ladies and brothers behind and behind
[3:07] every good man was a better woman
[3:09] probably
[3:10] and
[3:10] and it and and you know but
[3:13] regardless of all of that
[3:15] none of it
[3:16] could have been possible
[3:18] if it weren't for you
[3:21] and i i i want to salute you
[3:25] young people god bless you for your
[3:28] stand god bless you for your courage
[3:31] and and as great as that is
[3:34] none of it at all with all of those
[3:36] teams and all of that leadership and you
[3:38] coming and all of us gathering and
[3:40] preachers preaching brother branham said
[3:42] i can he said no matter how anointed i
[3:45] can be in the back he said if i come out
[3:48] and there's resistance he said god won't
[3:50] move

[9:32] exercised in this closing
[9:35] service lord we just have a few more
[9:37] moments together
[9:38] before we leave
[9:40] and i'm asking the presence of god would
[9:42] settle upon this building
[9:44] like a cloak lord
[9:46] that every word would be directed from
[9:48] your heart to our hearts
[9:50] take the last few words you say
[9:53] may they bring a reality
[9:55] to all of us
[9:57] in jesus name
[9:59] amen
[10:01] amen let's turn to our scripture first
[10:04] corinthians chapter
[10:06] 15 this morning
[10:08] how many believe in miracles
[10:11] we have less than an hour
[10:15] how many believe in
[10:16] miracles praise god so
[10:20] amen y'all be praying for brother john
[10:23] that we can uh
[10:24] be a miracle today amen
[10:27] first corinthians chapter 15 brothers i
[10:30] think we'll go right to the scripture
[10:32] good morning
[10:35] bethel tabernacle youth camp here we are
[10:38] we've come down to this
[10:40] are we going to run together well
[10:43] are we going to finish strong
[10:45] are you going to work with us
[10:47] i mean you pull really hard and god give
[10:50] brother john discipline from behind the
[10:52] pulpit i just want to say what he wants
[10:55] to say to you
[10:56] and then we all have to go
[10:58] but let's just bring our thoughts our
[11:00] strength
[11:01] you probably didn't get a lot of sleep
[11:03] last night i didn't either so we're all
[11:05] in this together
[11:07] but it's not by our might
[11:09] or by our strength
[11:11] it's by the spirit of god and we want to
[11:12] speak this morning on the rising
[11:14] generation and i believe i'm speaking to
[11:16] some of them
[11:17] first corinthians chapter 15
[11:20] verse 49
[11:26] i believe
[11:27] young people can take the meat of the
[11:29] word and
[11:31] go a little bit deeper
[11:33] so here we are paul speaking in verse 49
[11:37] and as
[11:38] we have borne the image of the earth
[11:41] earthy
[11:43] i want you to notice the rest of the
[11:46] verses we're going to read the shall the
[11:49] all it includes all of us and it's so
[11:52] positive as we have bore the image of
[11:54] the earthy we shall
[11:55] also bear the image of the heavenly
[11:59] you are going to make it right
[12:02] now this i say brethren that the
[12:05] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[12:07] kingdom of god neither does corruption
[12:09] inherit incorruption behold
[12:12] paul said i show you a mystery
[12:14] we shall
[12:16] not all sleep
[12:18] but we shall
[12:19] all be changed
[12:22] is that what the bible says
[12:24] we're not going to leave any of you out
[12:26] we shall all be changed in a moment
[12:29] let's all say a moment
[12:31] in the twinkling of an eye
[12:34] at the last trump for the trumpet
[12:37] shall sound
[12:38] and the dead
[12:40] shall be raised incorruptable and we
[12:43] shall be changed
[12:46] how many realize that could happen
[12:47] during this service right now
[12:50] how many realize brother branham could
[12:52] come walking through that back door
[12:55] how many of you have loved ones in your
[12:57] church or family that have passed away
[12:59] that you know are believers they could
[13:01] come walking brother jason right up the
[13:03] stairway come walking out behind this
[13:06] curtain come sister deb right back there
[13:08] wouldn't that be wonderful i mean i
[13:10] would certainly wake up some of you
[13:13] amen
[13:14] you talk about a last service that we
[13:16] would have as we would see these things
[13:18] we're living in the time of the
[13:20] resurrection young people this is the
[13:23] very next event for the bride of christ
[13:26] is for the resurrection
[13:29] but before that change
[13:31] god's bringing
[13:33] messages to you
[13:34] to prepare your heart to be ready
[13:38] thank you jesus
[13:40] verse 53 for this corruptible
[13:44] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[13:47] must put on immortality
[13:50] so when this corruptible no matter how
[13:52] young you are or strong you are all of
[13:54] our bodies and even our minds and our
[13:58] brains are passing away and it's
[14:00] corrupting
[14:03] when this corruptible shall have put on
[14:05] incorruption and this mortal
[14:09] shall have put on immortality
[14:12] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[14:14] that is written
[14:15] death is swallowed up in victory
[14:18] o death where is thy sting
[14:21] o grave where is thy victory
[14:23] the sting of
[14:25] death is
[14:26] sin
[14:27] and the strength of sin is the law but
[14:29] thanks be to god
[14:31] which giveth us the victory through our
[14:33] lord jesus christ
[14:35] thanks be to god who giveth bethel
[14:37] tabernacle youth camp and all of us
[14:39] together the victory
[14:42] we have the victory
[14:44] not we will have it you have it
[14:47] it's in you
[14:49] [Music]
[14:50] so what are what's some of the final
[14:52] words
[14:53] in verse 58 that we're going to hear
[14:55] after
[14:56] the closing remarks after all of this
[14:59] has been said and done
[15:01] therefore my beloved brethren
[15:04] young people
[15:06] be steadfast
[15:08] unmovable
[15:10] always say always
[15:13] abounding in the work of the lord for as
[15:15] much as ye know
[15:17] to all the teams
[15:19] we thank you
[15:21] we know
[15:23] that your labor
[15:26] is not in faith
[15:29] in the lord
[15:30] when you do something as unto the lord
[15:33] it's not in vain
[15:35] jesus
[15:36] is in this building right now
[15:38] does anybody else sense him
[15:41] anybody else sense though that other
[15:43] presence
[15:45] it's there to awaken you
[15:47] and that's why we have these meetings
[15:50] that would awaken
[15:51] these desires that you have inside of
[15:54] you for him
[15:56] he's here to awaken those things our
[15:58] last closing remarks
[16:01] may the lord speak to you in jesus name
[16:03] thank you you can have your seats and
[16:05] the brothers bring up our slides
[16:10] the rising generation
[16:13] and
[16:14] because our time is short
[16:17] and brother john is part of the miracle
[16:20] that's going to happen this morning
[16:23] and get you out before your lunch time
[16:31] thank you for
[16:32] letting us come
[16:34] and be part of your lives
[16:37] this is a
[16:38] a unique service a special for all of us
[16:41] i want to speak as
[16:43] as a
[16:44] middle-aged man born and raised
[16:47] in the message
[16:50] to you
[16:51] speaking
[16:52] to the rising generation
[16:54] and i believe
[16:56] what brother branham said in this quote
[16:59] is now
[17:00] been made real this weekend as you have
[17:02] made individual booths
[17:05] as we heard last night and
[17:08] that there's something laying right
[17:09] ahead for us
[17:11] and brother branham in the message a man
[17:13] running from the presence of the lord
[17:16] said remember i believe i'm prophesying
[17:18] great joys lays ahead believe it that's
[17:22] right many saddened hearts will be made
[17:25] great mysteries will be made clear and
[17:27] people who are sad
[17:29] will be turned into joy
[17:32] thank you jesus
[17:34] and as this weekend we've walked
[17:36] together through
[17:37] this is actually a doctors looking into
[17:40] the heart of the matter
[17:42] you can see them as they're looking over
[17:44] the heart of the person
[17:46] and and we've spoken along with brother
[17:48] burley and brother cadre and brother
[17:50] jason we've we've linked our
[17:53] gifts together for you to be servants
[17:56] on restoration and we've seen even
[17:58] throughout these last months how god has
[18:01] brought a theme now
[18:03] of restoration and how it's just
[18:05] continuing and last night we were
[18:07] speaking about the spiritual
[18:09] contractions trying to understand the
[18:11] thirst and the
[18:13] spasms and the groanings of what you
[18:15] have been going through as young people
[18:17] and then just directing your hearts to
[18:20] the booths now just as we leave our the
[18:23] campground this afternoon and all of us
[18:25] will
[18:26] and i prayed with my wife
[18:29] before the meetings and as we came into
[18:31] this services that every single person
[18:34] that came on to this campground as you
[18:37] drove in that when you drove out that
[18:39] you would be changed
[18:41] and i believe for some of you that has
[18:43] happened
[18:45] and i believe for all of us were better
[18:47] christians
[18:48] this afternoon
[18:50] than when we came onto the grounds
[18:53] prayers have gone for you and the
[18:55] restoration now of your booth is now
[18:59] up to your consecration it comes back to
[19:02] your personal dedication to the lord
[19:04] it's not for the crowd now we're we're
[19:07] gonna leave the camp and the 400 people
[19:10] or so and this afternoon we're going to
[19:12] have fathers and mothers and pastors and
[19:15] grandparents picking us up and driving
[19:17] us back to the airport and buses and in
[19:20] cars and summon airplanes as i just
[19:22] checked my flight and i think it's okay
[19:24] for tomorrow morning but here we are
[19:27] speaking to a rising generation and uh
[19:31] thank you brothers maybe you can just
[19:32] leave it on a slide number one as i just
[19:35] come to the service for the rising
[19:39] generation are you ready for this
[19:42] remember miracles do happen
[19:44] and i believe i'm i'm standing in the
[19:46] midst of a miracle
[19:49] in first corinthians chapter 15 that we
[19:52] read
[19:54] about the resurrection
[19:57] and there's two risings that i want to
[20:00] focus on
[20:01] this morning and that is number one the
[20:03] bride is rising now listen really fast
[20:07] with me
[20:09] the bride is rising
[20:12] but one day the sleeping saints are
[20:15] going to rise
[20:17] they've been sleeping they've been
[20:19] laying in the ground they've been
[20:21] waiting for you and i
[20:23] to come to our placing
[20:26] they've been waiting for the last one
[20:28] and there's been years have gone by
[20:30] you've had grand great-grandparents and
[20:33] grandparents and fathers and mothers and
[20:36] now
[20:37] and people around you and now there has
[20:39] to be a generation rise up that realize
[20:42] we are not in a going-down generation
[20:45] but we are in a rising generation
[20:49] when jesus stood in front of the tomb of
[20:52] lazarus
[20:53] and said lazarus come forth there was so
[20:57] much power and authority in that voice
[21:00] that if he would have said come forth
[21:03] every dead person would have come out of
[21:05] the grave
[21:07] come forth
[21:09] but he spoke specifically he spoke his
[21:11] name and lazarus walked out of the grave
[21:15] and he was stinking after four days
[21:18] and that was the duty of christ the
[21:21] messiah
[21:22] how many is thankful for the holy ghost
[21:24] how he speaks to us how many know what
[21:27] jesus then said to the people around the
[21:29] family the people he said loose him
[21:33] and let him go
[21:35] take off those grave clothes take off

[27:45] lives that we believe
[27:48] believers believe not just in a service
[27:51] but
[27:52] where the rubber meets the road
[27:55] and at school and in your family and
[27:57] when it's just
[27:58] and you might not even get the lunch

[28:26] never been before
[28:28] you've never you don't understand you've
[28:30] never been there you feel like like the
[28:32] mother eagle is kicking you out of the
[28:34] nest and you and you're turning around
[28:36] saying what are you doing why is it so
[28:38] prickly in this nest it's god telling
[28:40] you it's time to fly
[28:44] stop fussing
[28:46] stop singing those old songs and you
[28:48] know done somebody wrong song and
[28:50] talking about your hurt and your wound
[28:53] and your brokenness it's time for you to
[28:55] believe the word of god and in the bible
[28:58] there was a prince called mephibosheth
[29:02] and she was a prince that was wounded
[29:04] from a little child when jonathan and
[29:06] saul were killed in the message they
[29:09] wounded a
[29:13] but as the years went by and david now
[29:16] came to his place of anointing and
[29:18] kingship he said is there anyone of the
[29:20] family of jonathan that's alive and they
[29:22] said yes there's prince
[29:24] mephibosheth but he lives far away in
[29:27] lotabar
[29:28] out of cell range he's lived in a far
[29:30] desert place he's hiding from you and
[29:33] david said go get
[29:36] and mephibosheth walks in
[29:38] on his crutches and on his troubles and
[29:40] complexes thinking david's going to have
[29:42] him destroyed oh i finally got the
[29:44] prince that's been
[29:48] but that wasn't what was in david's
[29:49] heart that that's not what's in god's
[29:52] heart to destroy you he's here to
[29:55] elevate you and promote you
[30:03] you all know the story david brought him
[30:05] to the king's table said i want you to
[30:07] be around me around the king's table
[30:10] and so there was always times that
[30:12] mephibosheth would come walking in he
[30:14] would come a little early because
[30:16] there's a little bit of embarrassment
[30:18] and shame sometimes
[30:20] when you've been hurt and when you're
[30:21] wounded and he'd come in like this his
[30:24] legs whether it was crutches or i don't
[30:26] know if they had wheelchairs and he
[30:27] would put the
[30:28] crutches under the seat
[30:30] sister paris and
[30:32] he would just sit down at the table like
[30:34] this
[30:35] i don't know whose cell phone this is
[30:36] but it's got a nice cover and ten
[30:38] dollars in the back
[30:40] praise god i'll just take this cover off
[30:42] him
[30:44] is that for starbucks money
[30:47] oh it's not your phone okay
[30:52] and everybody's walking in and all the
[30:54] people's walking in they're all happy
[30:56] and sitting at the table mephibosheth
[30:58] down at the table and david comes
[31:00] walking in
[31:02] the king and mephibosheth is just tears
[31:04] coming out of his eyes because all
[31:06] sitting around the table
[31:09] we're all the same
[31:11] you can't see my lameness you can't see
[31:13] what's going on but i'm just glad to be
[31:15] here
[31:17] and david is there in his presence and
[31:19] it's so wonderful to be around the king
[31:20] and isn't it wonderful
[31:23] to be the king's kids and a daughter of
[31:25] god and a son of god who thinks that's
[31:27] wonderful and
[31:29] you cannot see the lameness under the
[31:31] table it's all under the blood it's all
[31:34] behind you
[31:43] leave the past behind you and rise jump
[31:47] out of the net
[31:49] and let the wings of faith
[31:51] carry you into god's will for your life
[31:54] and don't be ashamed of it don't be
[31:56] ashamed of what god's done for your life
[31:58] you're not going to flap fall flat on
[32:00] your face
[32:02] and if you do what are you gonna do
[32:05] you just get back up again you brush
[32:07] yourself off you get the mud off and you
[32:09] keep pressing on that's a rising
[32:12] generation
[32:19] god's asking some of you to step out of
[32:21] your comfort zone
[32:23] and to move from the carnal to the
[32:25] spiritual he's asking you to move
[32:28] addresses
[32:29] from the earthly to the heavenly
[32:32] i'm speaking very clearly i hope you're
[32:34] listening good
[32:36] move
[32:37] from being so carnal
[32:39] and moving to being more spiritual it's
[32:41] time to check out from this world
[32:44] it's time to check out from this world
[32:47] it's time for the saints that are
[32:48] sleeping to rise
[32:52] hallelujah
[32:53] luke chapter 17 speaks about the coming
[32:56] of the lord we don't have time it speaks
[32:58] about two will be in a bed one will be
[33:00] taken and the other left how many's
[33:02] heard that before
[33:04] okay so we don't need to turn to it two
[33:05] in a
[33:07] one will be taken and one will be left
[33:10] so it wasn't a homosexual lifestyle
[33:12] because one left
[33:14] is everybody being spiritual
[33:16] wake up
[33:19] you don't need the ministry to always be
[33:21] speaking about relationships to get into
[33:23] the service
[33:25] you're old enough to take some of these
[33:26] things now two in a bed one will be
[33:29] taken and one will be left that's got to
[33:31] be you
[33:33] two will be grinding at the field and
[33:35] working one's gonna be taken and one's
[33:37] going to be left
[33:38] the one that's taken that is you
[33:44] two will be in a field
[33:46] one will be taken one think about how
[33:48] close of a relationship would be to be
[33:51] in the same house
[33:52] to be in the same bed
[33:55] one has a walk with god one has their
[33:57] own private booth
[33:59] one has their own consecrated life and
[34:02] the very person brother matthew that's
[34:04] right next to them
[34:06] is not where they should be
[34:11] we sing when we all get to heaven
[34:14] but it is an individual walk with god
[34:20] malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 speaks about a
[34:23] generation that would receive a word
[34:25] prophet
[34:27] that's number one number two their
[34:29] hearts would be turned
[34:32] turn from the world turn from the things
[34:35] of this life
[34:37] i was going to say denominations but
[34:38] most of you don't even know what the
[34:40] denomination is that was 30 years ago in

[35:46] i'm asking this morning where is the
[35:48] generation that will go in the rapture

[36:48] generation that's going to make the
[36:50] change
[36:52] you are the generation that paul talked
[36:54] about brother branham talked about mid
[36:57] of old and sages they would have loved
[36:59] to have been at this camp service
[37:03] do we recognize our day
[37:05] and its message that there will be a
[37:06] generation
[37:09] believers that arising
[37:12] in the individual
[37:13] it's time to rise up
[37:16] i think brother caleb campbell where you
[37:18] at this morning
[37:20] had that yesterday
[37:24] it's time to get up
[37:26] it's time to wake up oh i'm sleepy i'm
[37:29] tired
[37:30] it's time to wake up
[37:32] it's time to stir yourself
[37:35] time to get stirring and get active
[37:38] because we're living in the final
[37:42] the final act of an age
[37:46] the bride is making ready to go and
[37:48] putting the final touches on his master
[37:52] pieces
[37:53] there's been camps camps
[37:56] brides brides churches churches
[38:00] generations young ladies young men but
[38:03] one day
[38:04] there's going to be a generation
[38:09] there's going to come a sweep over us
[38:16] there's just in a twinkling of an eye
[38:19] everybody twinkle your eye just like
[38:20] this
[38:22] now don't look to either side of the
[38:23] room you know
[38:24] but you just twink your eye like that's
[38:26] how fast it's gonna happen you shall be
[38:28] changed
[38:30] let's turn to first thessalonians we
[38:31] need this and this miracle
[38:34] we're walking in a miracle right now
[38:36] look up
[38:37] for your redemption drawleth nigh
[38:40] first thessalonians chapter 4.
[38:43] i'm just going to read one verse but you
[38:44] can read maybe write this down some of
[38:46] you are writing notes that's very good
[38:48] very good
[38:50] first thessalonians chapter 4 is the
[38:52] rapture chapter verse 16.
[38:55] the bible says for the lord
[38:58] himself and we got the lion of the tribe
[39:01] of judah up there all right first
[39:03] thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16 for the
[39:05] lord himself let's say lord himself
[39:09] shall descend from heaven
[39:11] with a shout out
[39:13] that's number one right
[39:16] with the voice of the archangel number
[39:19] two
[39:20] and with the trump of god
[39:23] and the dead in christ shall rise
[39:28] that's what we're looking for the
[39:30] resurrection
[39:31] is a real event it's the hope of the
[39:33] church
[39:35] and i have quotes for what i'm saying to
[39:37] you it's the hope of the church
[39:39] is the coming of the lord
[39:42] so before the great and dreadful day of
[39:44] the lord god's going to send a prophet
[39:46] that will literally turn the hearts of
[39:48] the last day children back to the faith
[39:51] and i thank god for the hickory bible
[39:53] tabernacle choir and how they they sang
[39:56] that song with passion
[39:58] and that god has lit your flame i hope
[40:00] some of you god has lit your flame
[40:03] i heard some of you sisters rejoicing
[40:05] and responding
[40:07] last
[40:08] night don't ever be embarrassed
[40:12] in the presence of god
[40:14] just learn
[40:16] to know
[40:17] that that is the place
[40:20] that's a safe
[40:22] when i walk out of airplanes many times
[40:24] and you'll see right on the wall the
[40:26] jetway jason it said this airport is a
[40:29] safe place that means if you're going
[40:31] through times of trouble or if you feel
[40:34] danger in your life you can come to this
[40:36] place talk to somebody
[40:39] staff talk to
[40:41] an airline talk to somebody this is a
[40:44] safe place if you're abused
[40:48] if you're being handled wrong
[40:51] this presence of god
[40:53] is a safe place
[40:55] learn to run in there learn to let go
[40:58] learn to let off the pressure learn to
[41:00] lift hands let's try it right now let's
[41:02] all lift these hands
[41:04] some of you are very tired some of you
[41:06] are
[41:07] take these hands
[41:10] and lift them up
[41:13] for i have not the strength
[41:16] near enough
[41:19] and then you start just this is a safe
[41:22] place
[41:24] i just heard yesterday of another church
[41:27] in the message
[41:29] and it's just high level things where
[41:32] young boys are being mishandled
[41:34] sexually
[41:36] that just does something to me it
[41:38] touches a raw nerve
[41:40] not just one two three up to five
[41:43] you want to see the blood boil of a real
[41:45] man of god
[41:47] is when you hear about that happening
[41:49] and people trying to cover it up and
[41:51] condone it
[41:52] that's not the message i don't care who
[41:54] it is
[41:55] what it is
[42:06] when that's all that we've preached for
[42:08] and lived for is to strengthen our young
[42:11] people strengthen our families
[42:13] and for a spirit to come in and people's
[42:16] trying to cover it up
[42:17] trying to sanction it because they're
[42:19] related to the pastor
[42:22] this is just yesterday i said god
[42:24] rebuked that thing
[42:26] that is not the holy ghost that is not
[42:28] the nature of the word there needs to be
[42:31] a rooting out and a repentance
[42:35] that's why there's a lack of revival
[42:38] in the message
[42:39] it's because young people hear what
[42:42] we've heard this weekend and they go
[42:44] back home and go back to places that is
[42:46] hiding sin
[42:51] we our young people deserve better than
[42:53] that
[42:55] [Applause]
[43:05] you're god's children
[43:07] and first thessalonians chapter 4 verse
[43:09] 16 we see this just quickly the shout
[43:12] the voice and the trumpet
[43:14] brother bradham said in the rapture
[43:16] message december the 4th 1965 the word
[43:19] rapture in the bible is not even used at
[43:21] all
[43:23] but the bible said caught up being
[43:25] caught up
[43:26] and that's in first thessalonians that
[43:28] was later down in that chapter it's the
[43:30] order of the great rapture that will
[43:32] take place in the last days three things
[43:34] that has to happen before the lord
[43:36] himself appears are you listening
[43:39] quickly
[43:40] shout voice a trumpet has to happen
[43:43] before jesus appears
[43:45] jesus does all three of them when he's
[43:48] descending
[43:50] i'm reading from a prophet a shout
[43:53] it's the message going forth
[43:55] the living bread of life bringing forth
[43:58] the bride
[43:59] so if jesus does all three of these
[44:01] things as he descends and the shout is
[44:05] the message
[44:07] we have a right to say this morning
[44:09] the message the rapture has already
[44:12] began
[44:14] it's a catching away it's something to
[44:16] gather the people together a shout
[44:20] and then a trumpet
[44:22] the trumpet is with the sound of a truck
[44:25] a voice i'm sorry i'm just trying to go
[44:27] quickly
[44:28] and skipping over but he said what is it
[44:31] a shout a voice and trumpet a shout it's
[44:33] the message to getting ready the second
[44:35] is the voice of the resurrection the
[44:37] same voice let's all say same voice
[44:40] with a loud voice not a whisper but in
[44:43] john 11 when he called lazarus from the
[44:46] grave getting the bride together the
[44:48] resurrection of the dead
[44:50] and to be caught up with it watch the
[44:52] three things the
[44:54] the next was a trumpet shout voice and a
[44:57] trumpet the sound of a trumpet what does
[45:00] it call a trumpet calls and he's talking
[45:02] about the feast of the trumpets a
[45:04] pentecostal feast and the feast of the
[45:06] trumpets he goes on but a trumpet is to
[45:08] announce a calling together

[45:13] spiritually we have been introduced in
[45:15] the month of october to the feast of
[45:18] tabernacles
[45:19] but before the feast you've got to have
[45:21] a booth

[45:52] the scripture

[48:05] message brother john has been raised in
[48:07] the message
[48:09] there's a little slogan and a little
[48:10] phrase we've heard for many many years
[48:14] said by a lot of ministers
[48:16] and that is that the young people and
[48:18] the children of the message
[48:20] are the church of tomorrow
[48:24] and they would address them that you are
[48:26] the church of tomorrow you are the
[48:28] church of tomorrow
[48:31] he's never heard that before you people
[48:34] and the children are the message of
[48:36] church of tomorrow

[48:47] tomorrow
[48:49] you are the church of the now
[48:52] you are the generation that is breathing
[48:54] these messages and word it's pulsating
[48:57] in your bosom

[49:38] some of you that love sports no you can
[49:40] go whole regulation basketball hockey
[49:42] football whatever you like and then
[49:44] it'll go to regulation then there'll be

[50:19] and forgive me if i offend you but let
[50:21] all the losers just sit on the
[50:24] bench if you don't have that kind of
[50:27] spirit ask god to give it to you
[50:29] but don't stand in the bride's way we're
[50:31] going up
[50:42] you want to stay in a tribulation that's
[50:44] up to you
[50:45] you want to go to a hell
[50:48] where brother branham said a burning
[50:49] literal hell would be like electrical
[50:52] wires going through you
[50:55] come on friends the first five minutes
[50:58] of when the rapture happens is going to
[51:01] be glorious for the bride but it's going
[51:03] to be torment for those in the message
[51:06] that have been in this type of
[51:08] atmosphere and missed the rapture
[51:11] there ought to be some zeal in your
[51:12] heart i will not miss the rapture
[51:15] [Applause]
[51:34] you may be seated let's give the
[51:36] microphone to brother paul what do you
[51:37] have to say it's time to lay aside every
[51:40] way
[51:41] and the unbelief that you came to camp
[51:43] with
[51:45] the sin that is holding you down i'm
[51:48] speaking to young ladies and young men
[51:50] it might be as small as a little
[51:51] lipstick thing or a little you know
[51:53] you're paining your fingernails shame on
[51:55] you
[51:56] we're supposed to be a bride we're not
[51:58] to look like the world
[52:08] who are you trying to impress living a
[52:10] double life
[52:12] living a double standard god knows all
[52:14] your hinder parts and your naked parts
[52:17] say i've done good this weekend nobody
[52:19] knows and i'm going to go right back
[52:20] yeah you go back
[52:23] but there's another generation
[52:25] that's going to take these messages and
[52:26] take this atmosphere
[52:28] that god knew that's why satan fought
[52:31] this camp so hard is because there was a
[52:33] blessing for you there was a revival for
[52:36] you there was a message for you
[52:45] as the days have gone by now
[52:48] as the weeks have gone by as the months
[52:50] have gone by in years now
[52:53] many people are becoming a victim
[52:56] to exactly what the devil planned and
[52:58] what he schemed and what he devised for
[53:01] this generation he planned an excellent
[53:04] diversion plan
[53:07] i've got to distract the people from the
[53:09] word
[53:10] a year and a half ago that's what was in
[53:13] satan's laboratory some of you thought
[53:15] it was out of wuhan china or whatever
[53:16] you think but it was a diversion from
[53:20] satan to take you away from the word
[53:24] and to get your mind on
[53:26] shutdowns masks
[53:29] vaccinations
[53:32] testing data science
[53:35] you can get quite all you want to
[53:38] he got your mind on numbers and virus
[53:40] counts and politics
[53:43] trump or biden
[53:47] it's not going to be the democrats that
[53:48] get you in a rapture
[53:50] it's not going to be the republicans
[53:52] it's not going to be the independence
[53:54] it's going to be thus saith the lord
[54:08] some of you in your churches were just
[54:10] coasting along
[54:12] and this virus came out of nowhere
[54:14] the sickness it was on television it was
[54:17] on media it was even in message purpose
[54:20] oh the sickness the virus the death
[54:22] but let me say this today
[54:25] it was not the government that shut down
[54:28] churches
[54:29] spiritually
[54:31] it was not local health officials
[54:34] that caused the coolness
[54:37] and the death
[54:38] to be stripping away revival from the
[54:42] people there's not one person that can
[54:45] claim an excuse
[54:47] for backsliding
[54:48] there's not one believer
[54:51] that can give an excuse of worldly
[54:53] events or school or officials you can
[54:55] get so upset at the officials no
[55:00] backsliding is not an option for a son
[55:03] or daughter of god
[55:07] and i encourage you
[55:11] my wife said the more they clap the
[55:13] longer you preach
[55:15] so
[55:16] i love you clapping i really do but i'm
[55:18] working in a miracle right now
[55:20] don't become a statistic
[55:29] you are the church
[55:31] of today
[55:32] tomorrow arrived
[55:34] and god has raised up young people
[55:36] globally
[55:39] globally i'm speaking this in south
[55:41] carolina
[55:42] but brother john has personally
[55:44] witnessed in the last six months
[55:46] throughout all the united states and
[55:47] then in europe that we've traveled and
[55:49] then globally speaking to young people
[55:52] there is a group of young men and women
[55:55] that are ready to serve
[55:58] they have been trained
[56:00] right their attitude is right
[56:04] their character is right
[56:08] they don't speak condescending
[56:13] they handle with care
[56:16] they speak the truth in love
[56:21] because they came from the womb of the
[56:23] message
[56:25] that old fighting spirit
[56:28] and the whole message
[56:30] there were old fighters that fought and
[56:33] through the wilderness and they had to
[56:34] be that way they feraled the field for
[56:36] us
[56:38] but brother branham talked about the
[56:39] sons
[56:41] of the old fighters
[56:43] it was that generation
[56:45] into the promised land
[56:47] and you can say what you want think what
[56:49] you want but you have to acknowledge
[56:52] that you are in another season
[56:55] and another time another era
[56:58] and you are living in a generation that
[57:00] god had in his mind a certain caliber of
[57:03] young men and young ladies older ones
[57:05] younger ones alike i'm not making ages
[57:08] here this is a generation it's not just
[57:10] young people joshua and caleb they were
[57:13] older caleb was older when he said give
[57:15] me my mountain
[57:17] he was 85 years old my father is 80
[57:19] years old but i'm i'm not speaking to
[57:22] you in a way to
[57:23] push you down i'm saying this is your
[57:26] time to rise
[57:32] are we doing okay
[57:34] i want to give a warning brother burly
[57:35] gave some mornings i want to get
[57:39] media
[57:40] obsession
[57:42] is a disease
[57:44] i'm speaking to young people the message
[57:46] some of my closing remarks media
[57:49] obsession is a disease
[57:51] it clouds the mind it clouds the spirit
[57:56] and it opens up the gates of the soul
[57:59] to wrong spirits
[58:01] some of you young people need to listen
[58:03] really good right now
[58:07] media obsession
[58:08] is a global pandemic
[58:11] it's the greatest global pandemic
[58:14] and covid is not the greatest covet
[58:17] pandemic sorry it is a covert pandemic
[58:20] but it's not the greatest pandemic
[58:22] that's in the world covet is not
[58:26] brother john has seen it
[58:29] media obsession is a virus
[58:32] it's a disease of devices
[58:35] electronic devices
[58:38] where young people are becoming digital
[58:41] addictors they're addicted
[58:44] to digital devices
[58:46] not drugs not alcohol not pills not
[58:49] gaming even though some young people and
[58:52] parents
[58:54] are more into gaming than the word of
[58:56] god then you wonder why your young
[58:58] people are the way they are it's time
[59:01] for fathers to arise
[59:03] mothers to arise ministers to arise the
[59:06] church to arise
[59:12] even science will tell you my my time is
[59:15] gone
[59:16] that dopamine is a chemical in the brain
[59:18] that is released through chemical
[59:20] devices but the holy spirit has sent
[59:22] another wage another wave and another
[59:25] surge of the holy spirit we've heard
[59:27] enough about it in the last year another
[59:29] wave another surge of this crazy virus
[59:31] it comes in and it'll go out and we've
[59:33] heard about these waves and these surges
[59:35] but i want to announce to you today
[59:37] there's another wave there's another
[59:39] surge it's called the holy ghost it's a
[59:42] powerful sudden forward motion then it
[59:46] goes upward then it goes out then it
[59:48] goes in and then it's going to take you
[59:50] away one day it's a supernatural force
[59:54] like the waves of tide that comes in and
[59:57] goes out this wave of the holy spirit
[1:00:00] that is moving and we've all heard about
[1:00:02] cases and restrictions and lockdowns and
[1:00:05] social distancing and we've we've said
[1:00:07] it already masks and vaccines and you
[1:00:09] know are you vaccinated are you not
[1:00:10] vaccinated have you been testing us
[1:00:12] enough and not
[1:00:14] friends we're in a rising generation
[1:00:17] death is striking the land sickness is
[1:00:19] striking the land but so is another wave
[1:00:22] of the holy ghost
[1:00:23] it's a global surge in the youth of this
[1:00:26] message
[1:00:27] it's a worldwide wave of god's
[1:00:30] quickening power it's back on display we
[1:00:33] saw it last night hallelujah we see it
[1:00:36] right now it's in the bride it's in the
[1:00:38] youth it's in the youth without borders
[1:00:43] it's the holy spirit does not need a

[1:01:10] you all going to give me a few more
[1:01:11] minutes
[1:01:13] no
[1:01:15] the rising generation you've been liking
[1:01:17] to sheep
[1:01:21] sheep
[1:01:22] tabernacle youth camp
[1:01:27] this is
[1:01:29] this is the body language of the holy
[1:01:31] spirit this weekend
[1:01:34] he's been reaching
[1:01:35] for you
[1:01:37] that's wonderful
[1:01:39] let this be
[1:01:40] something how a person can be going
[1:01:43] astray
[1:01:44] and that god is going to make you
[1:01:46] profitable in your life i'm speaking now
[1:01:49] to the rising generation you might have
[1:01:51] come into this camp unprofitable but god
[1:01:54] is going to make you profitable
[1:01:56] all we like sheep have gone astray
[1:01:59] we have turned everyone to his own way
[1:02:00] and the lord hath laid on him the
[1:02:02] iniquity of us all i have gone astray
[1:02:04] david said like a lost sheep
[1:02:07] seek thy servant for i do not forget thy
[1:02:09] commandment and we look at going astray
[1:02:11] some of you were in this condition
[1:02:13] coming to camp but you it means to air
[1:02:16] or wonder
[1:02:17] to stagger
[1:02:18] to wonder about the wondering of the
[1:02:20] mind
[1:02:21] mentally morally this is
[1:02:24] going astray
[1:02:25] this is what it means
[1:02:27] and the believer is typed as sheep all
[1:02:30] the bible says we was astray
[1:02:33] away from the shepherd
[1:02:35] and away from the fold
[1:02:38] and god has been encouraging us to come
[1:02:40] back come back
[1:02:43] and then god gives you patience
[1:02:45] for other sheep to mature and come to
[1:02:48] their place so it creates an atmosphere
[1:02:49] like a team
[1:02:51] that i i have now patience for others
[1:02:54] from unprofitable now god's gonna make
[1:02:56] you profitable from a slave
[1:02:59] to not much eternal good
[1:03:02] in your life a freedom to a prophet to a
[1:03:05] blessing
[1:03:06] to contributing to the body how many
[1:03:09] want to be a con contribution

[1:03:45] god bless you
[1:03:46] look at this this is what he looked like
[1:03:48] when he was caught
[1:03:52] and so when he was caught there was an
[1:03:53] australian sheepshear
[1:03:56] that had set a record for clipping sheet
[1:03:59] and he realized that this
[1:04:01] this guy's life is endangered
[1:04:05] this this gigantic sheep named chris
[1:04:08] had been found he could barely walk he
[1:04:11] was remember you and me are like sheep
[1:04:15] but from this
[1:04:17] sheep that was lost

[1:04:42] champion
[1:04:43] man shearing
[1:04:46] he had to be sedated brother chris
[1:04:51] because the cruelty of animals division
[1:04:55] it took 45 minutes to remove
[1:04:58] 18 inches 47 centimeters of fleece i
[1:05:01] want you to look at that because that's
[1:05:02] going to mean something 88 pounds
[1:05:05] of 45 minutes
[1:05:11] and this man said i don't think he'd
[1:05:13] been shorn before and i think he's five
[1:05:14] or six years old
[1:05:16] i wouldn't say it's high quality but you
[1:05:18] wouldn't expect it after so long in the
[1:05:20] bush
[1:05:22] but this chris he was br they're bred
[1:05:25] for especially for their rule they need
[1:05:27] to be
[1:05:28] they need to go to church regularly
[1:05:34] they need to go to church regularly
[1:05:37] or they can have trouble
[1:05:39] going to the bathroom
[1:05:42] and can develop serious medical issues
[1:05:47] oh my
[1:05:49] all thinking about this
[1:05:51] young people go through things if we
[1:05:53] don't go to the house of god and get
[1:05:54] shoring we have issues
[1:05:57] you might be just fine but you start
[1:05:59] having trouble in this certain area
[1:06:01] yeah it's desperate
[1:06:04] the average australian fleece
[1:06:08] takes approximately three minutes let's
[1:06:10] all say three minutes
[1:06:12] how long did it take to shear chris
[1:06:15] that's how long it takes when you're out
[1:06:17] of the spirit
[1:06:20] when you're not living where you should
[1:06:22] it takes a long time but just a few
[1:06:24] moments in his presence just an opening
[1:06:26] song just you know somebody gives a
[1:06:28] scripture and you're right there
[1:06:30] that's how it ought to be after you
[1:06:32] leave this camp just a few minutes
[1:06:35] brother branham talked about this about
[1:06:37] wool and lamb in the dove listen look
[1:06:39] you ought to listen to that message
[1:06:40] maybe this next week and how a sheep
[1:06:42] just lays there forfeits its rights this
[1:06:45] is chris
[1:06:46] after he was shorn
[1:06:49] a little bloody
[1:06:50] it hadn't happened before
[1:06:52] look at this rule 88 pounds
[1:06:56] and god is
[1:06:57] likening you and i to sheep that have
[1:06:59] gone astray
[1:07:02] i'm trying to click this brother matthew
[1:07:04] and it's not clicking so
[1:07:06] the miracle needs to continue
[1:07:08] help me out brothers
[1:07:12] what a photo
[1:07:13] is that beautiful
[1:07:15] this is chris chris needs help
[1:07:20] just keep clicking brothers
[1:07:23] you know he was found
[1:07:25] just a few kilometers from a farm
[1:07:29] he wasn't way away he was very close
[1:07:33] it wasn't like he was thousands of miles
[1:07:35] away some of you thought you were will
[1:07:37] far away and you've been brought
[1:07:39] very close
[1:07:40] god found you found your heart
[1:07:47] and you can see this how he had suffered
[1:07:50] things and he would have died within
[1:07:52] weeks brother jason the reason god
[1:07:54] allowed this weekend is because god knew
[1:07:57] if some of you wouldn't have been here
[1:07:58] there would have been trouble ahead
[1:08:00] so god fought through all of the
[1:08:02] unbelief so you could be here to be
[1:08:04] healed
[1:08:06] he was shy he was shaking
[1:08:11] this is shriek or shrek this is our last
[1:08:13] person i'm going to introduce you to
[1:08:16] this this young person had held the the
[1:08:19] record for years before chris
[1:08:22] he was hiding in a cave

[1:08:34] they're soaring
[1:08:35] we're closing now
[1:08:37] this is you and me
[1:08:39] when god really works in our hearts
[1:08:42] this is you and me

[1:08:47] my lambs
[1:08:49] feed my lambs feed my sheep that is a
[1:08:52] commission we are commissioned
[1:08:54] to feed the lambs come down to their
[1:08:56] level
[1:08:58] and whatever it takes
[1:09:00] from going astray to being profitable
