[6:02] morning everyone God bless you let's
[6:04] stand and
[6:07] pray Heavenly Father we just come before
[6:09] you Lord and we just want to commit this
[6:11] time into your hands Lord For Your Glory
[6:14] I pray that you would take your word and
[6:16] make it alive in our hearts father bring
[6:18] it to us as a supernatural Revelation
[6:21] father help each one of us to just get
[6:23] ourselves out of the way put the cares
[6:26] of this life to the side and focus on
[6:28] your word Lord come forth and move
[6:32] mightily amongst the people through your
[6:34] word we ask in Jesus name amen Amen
[6:37] brother Mark if you go ahead and bring
[6:38] up the PowerPoint we're going to start
[6:42] uh we're going to continue looking at
[6:45] Israel God's time piece this is part
[6:47] four and we're looking at verse 11 to
[6:51] start
[7:10] actually we're going to look at verse 13
[7:12] Romans 11 verse 13 and I'll start
[7:16] reading for I speak to you Gentiles in
[7:19] as much as I am the Apostle of the
[7:20] Gentiles I magnify mine office if by any
[7:24] means I may provoke to emulation them
[7:26] which are of are my flesh and might save
[7:30] some of
[7:34] them for if the casting away of them be
[7:37] the reconciling of the world what shall
[7:39] be the receiving what shall the
[7:41] receiving of them be but life from the
[7:42] dead for if the first fruits be holy the
[7:45] lump is also holy and if the root be
[7:47] holy so are the
[7:49] branches and if some of the branches be
[7:52] broken off and thou being a wild Olive
[7:54] Tree were Graft in among them and with
[7:56] them partake us of the root and fatness
[7:58] of the Olive Tree both not against the
[8:00] branches but if thou boast thou bearest
[8:02] not the root but the root thee thou
[8:05] Willl say then the branches were broken
[8:07] off that I might be grafted Graft in
[8:10] well because of unbelief they were
[8:12] broken off and thou standest by faith be
[8:15] high not high-m minded but fear for if
[8:19] God spared not the natural branches take
[8:20] heed lest he spared not thee behold
[8:23] therefore the goodness and severity of
[8:25] God on them which fell severity but
[8:27] toward the goodness if thou continue in
[8:30] his goodness other otherwise thou also
[8:33] shalt be cut
[8:35] off and they also if they abide not in
[8:39] still in unbelief shall be grafted in if
[8:41] God for God is able to graft them in
[8:43] again for if thou W cut off out of the
[8:46] Olive Tree which is Wild by nature and
[8:48] were grafted contrary to Nature into a
[8:51] good Olive Tree how much more shall
[8:53] these which be the natural branches be
[8:55] grafted into their own Olive Tree may
[8:58] the Lord add the blessing to the the
[8:59] reading of his word you can be
[9:06] seated so as we're looking at this and
[9:09] we've we were we've been talking over
[9:11] the last few times and comparing it back
[9:15] to some of
[9:17] the uh uh false teaching that has gone
[9:21] in the history of the church that's
[9:23] seems to be getting a
[9:25] Revival and I think much of that false
[9:28] teaching of what we call
[9:31] postmillennialism or a millennialism
[9:33] that views the church as the replacement
[9:36] for
[9:37] Israel um is is coming because
[9:43] people people see a conspiracy under
[9:46] every Rock and many times that has been
[9:51] proven true so therefore they see world
[9:55] powers working together Israel is one of
[9:58] these world powers they begin to think
[10:01] well if if all these nations are evil
[10:05] then this nation must also be evil and
[10:08] part of a
[10:09] conspiracy and so forth and it's not the
[10:12] place to get into all the details of
[10:15] that uh I think if you if you've seen
[10:18] much much uh chatter in the Christian
[10:22] World there is becoming somewhat of a
[10:25] small but growing anti- Zionist uh idea
[10:30] and
[10:31] movement to to despise Israel and again
[10:35] as we talked about in the past it's it's
[10:38] a it just as much as it's a mistake to
[10:41] look at Israel and say everything they
[10:42] do must be of God that's a mistake it's
[10:46] also a mistake to divorce Israel from
[10:51] the promises of God in the Bible that is
[10:54] an error the message goes right down the
[10:56] line brother brandom acknowledges that
[10:58] there is a wall treat Jew which in
[11:01] itself is lend lending it to the idea of
[11:05] these atheists who have have their hands
[11:09] in the stock market and in banking and
[11:12] are seeking to control everything behind
[11:14] the scenes and certainly they are at the
[11:18] same time there
[11:20] is his chosen they are his chosen people
[11:23] they've always been a rebellious
[11:26] people and and they're
[11:29] their their progenitor his name is
[11:33] Jacob so when we see that and understand
[11:36] that he's a supplanter and a deceiver so
[11:39] we see that's going to be the nation's
[11:41] natural
[11:42] tendencies going forward we shouldn't be
[11:45] shocked to see an element within Israel
[11:49] that is as brother Brandon put it a real
[11:52] Shyer yes that's his
[11:55] terminology and but that that doesn't
[11:58] eliminate the fact that within that core
[12:02] there is a seed there is a kernel within
[12:05] within or within that big picture of
[12:09] Israel it's as though it be as the sand
[12:11] of the sea only a Remnant will be saved
[12:15] got he's looking for that
[12:18] 144,000 all that he's doing to restore
[12:20] Israel is for that
[12:23] 144,000 and in order to restore this
[12:25] very Earth because it's his promises to
[12:28] who to the fathers it's not because
[12:31] Israel's good it's not because they're
[12:33] better than any Nation though they may
[12:35] think that though they may act like that
[12:38] has nothing to do with go the fact God
[12:40] did promise to them
[12:44] amen Paul is giving us the same warning
[12:47] don't be high-m minded I'm I'm the I'm
[12:49] the bride I'm the church I'm the Gentile
[12:51] God's dealing with Gentiles he not
[12:52] dealing with Jews we're the we're the
[12:55] ones that replace God's chosen people be
[12:57] careful be not
[12:59] high-minded he cut Israel off because of
[13:02] this
[13:03] idea you you don't think that you can't
[13:06] go off into air don't think that you
[13:07] can't go off into unbelief he will cut
[13:11] you off now again we're not talking
[13:15] about uh individual
[13:18] predestination God never if he saves
[13:20] someone he never turns away from that
[13:23] person he saves them to Christ came to
[13:26] save them to the uttermost amen as
[13:30] individuals but when we're looking at
[13:31] the church world as a whole and we're
[13:33] looking at Israel as a whole it's the
[13:36] the same rule applies is what we're
[13:38] talking about is the movement of the
[13:40] church the Jesus calls it in um Matthew
[13:44] 13 the Kingdom of Heaven shall be
[13:46] likened unto and there's all kinds of
[13:49] rotten things going on in the kingdom of
[13:52] heaven right what is it it's Christendom
[13:56] it's Christianity it's amongst the
[13:59] people that identify themselves by the
[14:01] name of Jesus though though they have
[14:03] not the name of Jesus upon them that's
[14:07] only the elected bride but they name
[14:09] themselves by the name of Jesus so he
[14:12] addresses himself to them all all the
[14:16] each one of the seven churches in Asia
[14:19] my goodness what failure what horrible
[14:22] failure he addresses himself first to
[14:25] the angel and that message goes to the
[14:27] angel and that angel is to deliver that
[14:29] message to the church and it always
[14:32] there's always two things going on right
[14:35] it's to the
[14:36] churches he that hath an ear let him
[14:38] hear what the spirits say to the
[14:40] churches not everybody hears not
[14:43] everybody listens who hears and who
[14:44] listens the Overcomer to him that
[14:48] overcometh every by by the grace of God
[14:51] the utter failure of the seven Church
[14:54] ages through that there's some that are
[14:58] ordained to over come the failure in in
[15:02] each
[15:03] age you know as as the
[15:07] post-millennial Viewpoint is that
[15:09] Christianity is going to take over the
[15:11] world and create a worldwide government
[15:15] that controls everything through
[15:18] Christianity and then after that happens
[15:21] Christ will return and this is the idea
[15:25] that they have that goes along with
[15:27] replacing Israel
[15:29] they take the scriptures that say not
[15:31] all Israel is Israel and true Israel is
[15:34] the ones who are
[15:35] circumcised in what where the heart not
[15:39] just the flesh they take that and they
[15:41] dismiss everything else that is
[15:46] spoken and that's that's why I feel like
[15:49] it's important to see this in the
[15:50] scripture because the Devil is a
[15:52] deceiver yeah amen and his favorite
[15:55] thing to use is to deceive
[15:59] is not news media though he does use it
[16:01] what does he used to deceive people
[16:05] with mis understanding misuse of the
[16:10] Bible
[16:13] amen so he says Paul is speaking still
[16:17] in Romans
[16:18] 11 of this distinction between Gentiles
[16:22] Israel Gentiles Israel why does he do
[16:26] that we spoke about that before
[16:30] even in uh probably part
[16:35] one he says in First Corinthians 10 31
[16:39] and
[16:41] 32 where wherefore whether therefore you
[16:45] eat or drink or whatsoever you do do all
[16:47] to the glory of God give none offense
[16:50] neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles
[16:53] nor to the Church of
[16:57] God so he makes three
[16:59] distinctions we look in the world and we
[17:02] have lots of different distinctions we
[17:04] can we can break things down by Nations
[17:07] we can break things down by quote
[17:09] unquote skin color we can break things
[17:12] down by what party you're a part of in
[17:16] politics we can but in the Bible we
[17:19] break down three things Jews Gentiles
[17:23] and the
[17:25] church and the church means the called
[17:29] ones from the Jews and the
[17:31] Gentiles
[17:32] right we can read EP you can go ahead
[17:35] and read Ephesians
[17:37] 2 Gentiles through faith are made
[17:41] partakers of all the promises of God all
[17:44] the promises of God
[17:47] now this is another thing that they'll
[17:49] you that that uh these modern anti-
[17:53] Zionist will use to show see the the
[17:57] church is a new thing and Israel has
[17:59] done away with again why why is Paul
[18:03] continually speaking in these three
[18:06] different ways he's he's always bringing
[18:09] this distinction even within the church
[18:12] he's making the distinction between
[18:14] Israel and Gentiles Jews and Greeks and
[18:18] it's very important for us not to miss
[18:22] that fact the church is the called out
[18:24] ones from Jews and Gentiles and yet they
[18:27] still maintain in the church in the
[18:30] standing of the church there's no first
[18:32] class and second class citizens am the
[18:35] Jew is not
[18:37] above the Gentile you say but Paul said
[18:40] to the Jew first and also to the Greek
[18:42] no the preaching of the Gospel goes to
[18:45] the Jew first and also goes to the Greek
[18:49] amen but remember in Acts what does he
[18:51] say because the Jewish people considered
[18:54] themselves Unworthy of the grace of God
[18:56] we will turn and go unto
[18:59] the
[19:00] Gentiles they rejected and turned away
[19:02] from the word and therefore God rejected
[19:06] and turned away from them and this is
[19:09] what we're getting at and getting to
[19:11] this point here in Romans
[19:15] 11 graph graphing in grafting
[19:19] in the Wild Olive gets grafted in to the
[19:24] nurtured and cared for Olive we were
[19:27] Gentiles were were wild they're olives
[19:31] but they're wild and so God cut
[19:36] off the
[19:38] Israeli Olive Branch right why because
[19:41] they weren't bearing fruit we can go
[19:43] back and look at the different Parables
[19:46] that Jesus
[19:47] brought but they were cut off because of
[19:50] unbelief their their unbelief produced a
[19:53] lack of
[19:55] fruit and so the danger then again and
[19:58] that Paul Paul is mentioning to the
[20:00] Gentiles in general is
[20:02] you per peradventure you fall in
[20:05] unbelief God will cut you off and graph
[20:09] in the natural Branch again all right so
[20:15] there's going to come a time I believe
[20:16] this is this this is a prophecy Paul is
[20:19] saying there's going to come a time
[20:21] where the
[20:23] Gentile masses of people will be
[20:26] concluded in unbelief yes amen they have
[20:30] taken and rejected the message that God
[20:33] sent to them
[20:35] am they've they've turned away from it
[20:38] and because they've turned away from it
[20:40] God says I'm concluding you in unbelief
[20:44] I'm cutting you off and I'm grafting
[20:48] in the natural
[20:53] branches for I would not Brethren that
[20:55] you should be ignorant of this mystery
[20:59] th you should be wise in your own
[21:01] conceits that blindness in part is
[21:04] happened to
[21:07] Israel all right blindness in part has
[21:09] happened to Israel so what is Israel
[21:12] again going back to this anti- Zionist
[21:15] mindset what is Israel what is he
[21:17] talking about the church we're so
[21:20] confused by by this terminology I
[21:22] thought the Gentiles were the church or
[21:25] is it Israel's the church who's the what
[21:27] is he see it brings a
[21:31] confusion blindness in part has happened
[21:33] to Israel that's the people of the 12
[21:36] tribes that lived in the land when Jesus
[21:39] came when the apostles preached the
[21:41] gospel and people that were not even in
[21:44] the land were out in the diaspora that
[21:46] Paul went to wherever he went to what
[21:49] did he do where did he go to
[21:51] First not the Pagan Temple Am he went to
[21:55] the synagogue to preach the gospel they
[21:58] rejected did yeah so that's what PA Paul
[22:01] is right in the midst of this he's not
[22:03] talking about something that happened
[22:04] somewhere else he's in the midst of this
[22:06] and he says blindness everywhere I
[22:09] preach they're blind they can't see it
[22:12] they can't see that Messiah has come and
[22:15] become a sacrifice for our sins it's
[22:17] right in the scripture but they're
[22:18] totally blind to
[22:20] it but it's only that
[22:23] blindness has happened
[22:26] only until the fullness of of the
[22:29] Gentiles be come in
[22:32] amen so there there is an expiration
[22:35] date on the
[22:38] blindness Saints they're still in
[22:44] blindness I don't know if we'll get to
[22:45] that scripture but they're restored back
[22:48] to the land in unbelief and sin and it's
[22:51] not back till they're restored back to
[22:53] the land that he pours upon them the
[22:55] spirit of Grace and supplications
[22:58] they're still in
[23:01] blindness what is the fullness of the
[23:03] Gentiles become in what is that mean
[23:08] well we have a very good uh statement
[23:12] that brother brandham uses and takes
[23:14] from actually irenaeus says when the
[23:17] last predestinated
[23:19] seed comes in then he turns and deals
[23:26] with
[23:27] Israel so when that last predestinated
[23:30] Gentile believer comes in and receives
[23:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the
[23:36] time that he will come in and start
[23:38] dealing that's the fullness of the
[23:40] Gentiles when the last number of the
[23:43] predestinated seed comes in that is when
[23:46] the fullness of the Gentiles comes
[23:48] that's when blindness will be done away
[23:51] with amen and so all Israel shall be
[23:54] saved as it is written there shall come
[23:56] out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn
[23:58] away ungodliness from Jacob amen so all
[24:04] Israel shall be saved every single
[24:07] person in Israel millions of people
[24:11] no no because in
[24:14] Revelation Jerusalem is called the city
[24:18] that is spiritually Sodom and gomorah
[24:21] and Tel Aviv is one of the capitals of
[24:24] the world of homosexuality and gay pride
[24:27] movement
[24:29] um and even Jerusalem every June has a
[24:32] pride
[24:34] parade so the PO the politics of Israel
[24:38] is perverted and corrupted yet God has
[24:40] his Sovereign hand over all of
[24:44] it but will all Israel be saved no not
[24:48] all Israel will be saved well scripture
[24:50] says all Israel shall be saved there's
[24:54] many scriptures that we can go into that
[24:56] can describe to you that just
[24:59] means many Jews will be saved but if if
[25:03] you look at one in particular uh we
[25:06] won't bring it up I'll just refer to it
[25:08] is uh in the gospels and multiple times
[25:13] it says that all of Judea and Samaria
[25:17] went out to be baptized of
[25:21] John so what what what does all mean
[25:23] many did this is the language of the
[25:26] Bible many of them did no not every
[25:29] single one did cuz why did Jesus rebuke
[25:32] the Pharisees for not believing in
[25:34] John's baptism they weren't baptized by
[25:37] John and yet it says all Judea and
[25:39] Samaria went out to be baptized masses
[25:41] of people went out to be baptized by
[25:44] him a great Revival is
[25:47] coming it's not coming to the
[25:49] Gentiles this is the great Revival
[25:52] that's coming you'll see
[25:55] 144,000 saved from from the tribes of
[26:04] Israel for this is my Covenant unto them
[26:07] when I shall take away their
[26:09] sins this is speaking of uh J Jeremiah
[26:13] the New Covenant as concerning the
[26:16] gospel they are enemies for your sakes
[26:18] but as concerning the election they are
[26:21] beloved for the father's sakes I think
[26:25] this perfectly
[26:27] describes what our attitude and our
[26:29] vision for Israel should
[26:32] be this scripture we understand they are
[26:37] enemies there are our enemies because of
[26:39] the Gospel that's a fact that's a fact
[26:42] on the ground in
[26:45] Israel if if if you were to go and start
[26:47] preaching to Jews openly in Israel it
[26:51] would be the last time you ever went to
[26:53] the
[26:54] country if you have a church and go
[26:56] preach at the church no problem but if
[26:59] you try to start evangelizing Jews big
[27:05] problem many missionaries have been
[27:07] turned out that have tried to operate
[27:09] openly and baptize Jews they've been
[27:12] turned out and and their visas canceled
[27:14] deported and never allowed back in the
[27:16] country am they are enemies they hate
[27:19] the gospel they still hate their Messiah
[27:23] call him names blaspheme
[27:26] him but as in the
[27:29] election they are beloved for the
[27:32] father's sake even as enemies just like
[27:36] us just like us before we were saved we
[27:40] were enemies with God and yet because of
[27:43] election you were beloved that's the
[27:46] same thing with Israel we can look at
[27:48] those Jewish people who reject our our
[27:52] our Lord and savior we can look at them
[27:55] and say you are beloved because not
[27:58] because you're good you're
[28:01] not not because you have some
[28:06] uh uh something better than anyone else
[28:09] it's because he made the promises to
[28:11] your
[28:12] ancestors and he will never turn away
[28:15] from his promises he will always fulfill
[28:18] his promises for his
[28:21] elect for the gifts of and calling of
[28:25] God are without repentance we always uh
[28:28] sort of diverse separate this verse from
[28:30] its context and that's fine it's true
[28:33] separated from the context
[28:35] mostly but the context is Israel and
[28:40] he's saying God has given them gifts
[28:43] he's call has a calling for them to
[28:46] obtain that the world would receive
[28:48] salvation through them that they would
[28:51] have a king over them ruling and
[28:54] reigning forever he has a promise for
[28:57] them amen and so God doesn't change his
[29:00] mind doesn't turn back from that it is
[29:02] his perfect promise to them and he will
[29:06] fulfill it as impossible as it might
[29:08] seem With God all all things are
[29:13] possible for as ye in times past have
[29:16] not believed God yet have now obtained
[29:19] Mercy through their unbelief amen it's
[29:22] because of their unbelief that God
[29:24] turned and began to deal with the
[29:26] Gentiles and Paul speaks of that
[29:28] as a great mystery the the the the Jews
[29:32] always looked and saw that salvation
[29:34] that they were to be the Light of the
[29:35] Nations and that salvation would come to
[29:38] the Nations through them and Paul takes
[29:41] the verse that applies to the nation of
[29:44] Israel applies it to him and
[29:46] Barnabas says we're the light of the
[29:50] Gentiles God did use two Jews to go out
[29:54] and bring the gospel to the Gentiles yes
[29:58] amen and it's through their unbelief
[30:01] that Paul by the spirit turned and began
[30:06] to deal with the Gentiles that was God
[30:08] doing that as we spoke about last time
[30:12] the Jews had their idea in their process
[30:15] of how salvation would
[30:17] come as in the past they felt that in
[30:20] order to in order to obtain salvation
[30:24] you have to get
[30:25] circumcised and start following the law
[30:28] of Moses and even many of them became
[30:31] Believers in Christ and still held this
[30:34] Viewpoint and went out from Jerusalem
[30:38] behind Paul and Barnabas and said you
[30:41] guys are mixed up you got to be
[30:43] circumcised and follow the law of
[30:46] Moses a and it became such a problem
[30:50] that they called for Paul and Barnabas
[30:52] to come Antioch said Paul and Barnabas
[30:56] you go to Jerusalem we we believe your
[30:59] message we believe God sent you but you
[31:02] got to go solve this cuz guys are coming
[31:04] from Jerusalem and saying hey you got to
[31:07] follow the law of
[31:10] Moses and so they go there and they
[31:13] write the Jerusalem Council gathers and
[31:15] what happens don't eat meat sacrifice to
[31:19] Idols don't eat meat with blood in it or
[31:24] things strangled avoid sexual immorality
[31:28] etc etc this was to be the law of the
[31:33] Gospel that went forth only is that what
[31:36] Paul did Paul even obey
[31:40] this if you read the the Epistles
[31:42] certainly did
[31:44] not what did Paul write to the Galatians
[31:47] this only would I learn of you receive
[31:49] ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or
[31:53] by the hearing of Faith
[31:55] amen the the question is obvious the
[31:58] answer is obvious and he mentions that
[32:01] several times they they didn't receive
[32:03] the Holy Ghost they didn't receive they
[32:05] didn't come and be partakers of the New
[32:07] Covenant by the baptism of the Holy
[32:09] Ghost by working themselves into it or
[32:13] becoming worthy of it no they simply
[32:16] heard the word and believed and the
[32:18] spirit fell on them just like
[32:20] Cornelius and Peter made that me message
[32:23] clear I didn't go to Cornelius and say
[32:25] hey Cornelius you got to make sure to
[32:28] avoid eating meat with blood in it and
[32:31] um uh not eat things strangled and so on
[32:35] and so forth
[32:37] no no he he he never God didn't do that
[32:40] God already decided how he was going to
[32:43] save the
[32:44] Gentiles God had Vindicated how he was
[32:46] going to save the Gentiles then again
[32:49] through Paul and Barnabas and here man
[32:52] is trying to get his hands and say it
[32:54] must be this way where God is doing it
[32:56] this way God had had decided to send
[32:58] Paul God was working through Paul God
[33:01] sent Paul even to the Gentiles that were
[33:04] in throughout the Roman Empire to preach
[33:07] the gospel to them and what did they do
[33:10] he God wanted to make sure that Israel
[33:12] had one last chance to repent what did
[33:16] they
[33:17] do we don't want
[33:19] that Paul says you you counted
[33:22] yourselves Unworthy of the grace of God
[33:25] because of that we shake the dust from
[33:27] our feet and we'd go to the Gentiles
[33:31] amen that doesn't eradicate the promises
[33:34] of God right that doesn't change
[33:38] anything for the future
[33:40] promises however it is the revelation of
[33:43] the mystery which was hidden in God how
[33:46] that he was going to save Gentiles he
[33:49] was going to give them the Holy Ghost is
[33:51] he's going to Israel was going to reject
[33:53] the
[33:54] Messiah right and now the Gentiles could
[33:57] receive the promises made to the
[34:01] ancestors the fathers now we can be
[34:03] fellow citizens and partakers of the
[34:07] promises of God not by The Works of the
[34:09] law but by faith
[34:12] amen and so for Israel to be reso
[34:15] restored it's not going to be because
[34:17] they have a
[34:19] temple they will but that's not what
[34:22] restoration means it's not going to
[34:24] because they sacrifice a red heer
[34:26] everybody's oh red he first coming this
[34:29] sure that will be there and it'll be
[34:32] taken over by the
[34:34] Antichrist that'll be there but that's
[34:37] not what restores them what restores
[34:40] them is that God sends two two
[34:43] Messengers to preach the message of the
[34:45] hour to them they hear it by faith and
[34:49] they're sealed with the Holy Ghost and
[34:51] their father the father's name is
[34:52] written in their foreheads in other
[34:54] words they receive a revelation of the
[34:56] name of almighty God the Lord Jesus
[34:59] Christ and they're baptized in his name
[35:01] and they receive the Holy Ghost that's
[35:03] how Israel will obtain restoration not
[35:07] by getting faithful to Moses not by
[35:09] making a temple that'll be there for the
[35:14] Antichrist
[35:17] amen well by the grace of
[35:20] God time is getting short both for me
[35:25] and spiritually
[35:28] when
[35:29] when when the Rapture takes place that's
[35:32] when he turns to deal with the
[35:35] Jews the bride has to be taken out of
[35:37] the
[35:38] way
[35:40] right pulled aside so Joseph can reveal
[35:43] himself to his
[35:45] Brethren and so that that that is coming
[35:48] close and when that happens Satan comes
[35:53] down incarnates a man goes on a rampage
[35:57] against the the people of God
