[18:03] well you mean like a pencil and paper
[18:06] but actually it was in my mind the Lord
[18:09] uh you ever had you ever heard those the
[18:11] people who write songs and
[18:13] say this song the whole song came to me
[18:15] and just like fell out of the heavens
[18:16] and I wrote the whole thing down in 10
[18:18] minutes and I've done that I've had I've
[18:20] had the whole concept of sermons drop
[18:22] out of the heavens on me like that and

[19:22] family amen happy to have brother
[19:24] mcfaden here today um amen so been
[19:27] knowing that family for quite a while
[19:30] amen second Peter chap
[19:34] 3 verse
[19:37] 9 the Lord is not slack concerning his
[19:41] promise aren't you glad as some men
[19:43] count slackness but is longsuffering to
[19:46] usw not willing that any should perish
[19:50] but that all should come to repentance
[19:52] but the day of the Lord will come as a
[19:55] thief in the night in the which the
[19:57] heavens shall pass away away with a
[19:59] great noise and the elements shall melt
[20:01] with fervent heat the Earth also and the
[20:04] works that are therein shall be burned
[20:06] up it's pretty graphic seeing then that
[20:10] all these things shall be dissolved what
[20:13] manner of persons ought you to be in all
[20:16] holy conversation and godliness I think
[20:19] that is one of the most relevant
[20:20] questions he could ask having just said
[20:23] that everything's going to just look
[20:25] like it's going to be completely
[20:26] annihilated now we know brother brandham
[20:28] uh taught taught us in in the future
[20:30] home it's not Annihilation but but it
[20:33] looks like it'll be annihilated but the
[20:35] Earth is an eternal attribute of God and
[20:37] it can never be annihilated and so it's
[20:39] going to be renovated but but the the
[20:42] language here a fervent Heat and the
[20:45] works are burned up and the elements
[20:47] melt my goodness so so he says all of
[20:50] these things are going to be dissolved
[20:52] what manner of persons that being said
[20:54] that being true how ought we to be
[20:56] living see looking looking for here here
[20:59] he is going to have give you half your
[21:01] answer looking for and hastening unto
[21:04] the coming of the day of God wherein the
[21:07] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[21:10] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[21:12] heat
[21:13] nevertheless we according to his promise
[21:17] look for new heavens and new earth
[21:20] wherein dwelleth righteousness I think
[21:24] Peter has certainly assumed that we're
[21:27] not going to be part of the fervent heat
[21:29] dissolving elements passing away that
[21:32] when all of that happens somebody's
[21:34] still going to be
[21:35] alive amen wherefore beloved seeing that
[21:40] ye look for such things be diligent that
[21:44] you may be found of him in peace without
[21:47] spot and blameless my that's a tall
[21:51] order let's
[21:53] pray father we thank you for your word
[21:57] thank you for the message that's upon my
[22:00] heart thank you for the Gathering of the
[22:02] people here tonight Lord and we're
[22:05] coming to you with a special prayer
[22:07] requests Lord we have special requests
[22:09] that have come in from sister Melissa
[22:12] Lord concerning the safe return of of of
[22:16] Jessica Lord coming back in from South
[22:18] America she has also a prayer for a
[22:21] second grade student
[22:22] unexpectedly lost a mother uh extremely
[22:26] close and um and so there's a lot of
[22:29] broken heart hearts there Lord we're
[22:31] asking for your mercy father in that
[22:34] case Lord there were other requests that
[22:37] came in and you know all about them and
[22:40] master we have a number of people in the
[22:42] assembly that are sick Lord and we're
[22:45] asking for your divine mercy upon their
[22:47] lives now help them Father to be
[22:50] recovered quickly we pray you bless us
[22:53] now tonight in Jesus name amen God bless
[22:56] you friends you can be seated
[23:14] tonight is a special service because it
[23:18] is the uh we it's the night that we
[23:21] choose uh to take and and recognition of
[23:25] the Lord's Passover you know Jesus told
[23:27] his disciples when he came to that to
[23:30] that third Passover there in his
[23:32] ministry and he said I have desired to
[23:36] have this Passover with you he had
[23:39] already had in his ministry he had
[23:40] Passover his whole life uh but after he
[23:44] began his ministry he only had a an
[23:46] Earthly Ministry of three and a half
[23:48] years under a Roman Calendar three years
[23:50] under a Jewish calendar uh and so he had
[23:53] three Passover times with his disciples
[23:56] in his ministry and when he came to the
[23:59] last when he said I have desired with a
[24:01] great desire to have this Passover to
[24:05] come to the table and and you know the
[24:08] disciples you know they were given
[24:09] instructions go here and and ask and
[24:12] inquire where where will the Lord have
[24:14] his supper and they'll take you and
[24:16] they'll show you a room and you'll make
[24:18] ready uh for our supper and so you know
[24:22] this is exactly why that we don't we
[24:24] don't take it in the daytime because it
[24:26] wasn't the Lord's morning meal wasn't a
[24:29] Noonday meal it wasn't an afternoon meal
[24:31] it was an evening uh it was an evening
[24:33] time supper and so we realize that uh
[24:37] the Passover there came uh from the Old
[24:40] Testament when the death angel passed
[24:43] through and God delivered Israel out of
[24:45] Egypt and so that was a very special
[24:48] time for them and the Lord's Passover
[24:51] was very special we are coming tonight
[24:53] to the Lord's table you say well it's
[24:55] just a table you probably bought it at a
[24:57] super store and and but but you know
[25:00] we're going to consecrate this table
[25:02] we're going to dedicate this and we're
[25:03] going to consecrate the elements of the
[25:06] Lord's Supper the bread and the wine and
[25:08] it was it was carefully thought through
[25:12] how to bring these elements together and
[25:14] we don't just throw them away that
[25:15] you're not allowed to do that even if
[25:18] there's bread left over it has to
[25:20] actually be burned before the next
[25:22] morning light or it has to be consumed
[25:24] or it has to be buried and so so so you
[25:28] realize that we we're we don't go as the
[25:31] as the Roman system that says it's the
[25:33] actual body of the Lord which if they
[25:36] would just think that through they would
[25:38] realize that's not true because you're
[25:40] the body of the Lord I'm the body of the
[25:43] Lord and so we realize that we're not
[25:46] going to reduce God down uh you know
[25:48] they they reduce him down to a wafer and
[25:50] people realize they they think they eat
[25:52] that wafer and they take in Christ into
[25:55] themselves I'm so glad that it's more
[25:57] Supernatural than that and because if it
[26:00] was just a wafer then it's you know
[26:02] while that's in my body whatever
[26:04] nutrients I could get out of it I could
[26:05] get out of it but I want something that
[26:08] feeds me every day I want something that
[26:10] surges through me and gives me life in
[26:13] it and so I you know we were having that
[26:16] discussion there uh Brother Bruce and
[26:18] sister Linda and I about the whole
[26:20] reason of fermented uh wine why don't
[26:23] why don't we use just the unfermented
[26:24] grape juice because you don't you don't
[26:27] put you can put grape Ju s old bottles
[26:29] all day long it doesn't have any life in
[26:30] it there's no fermentation going on but
[26:33] when something is fermented has life and
[26:35] it it's going to burst forward and so so
[26:38] we we wouldn't want to we wouldn't want
[26:39] to partake of something that would
[26:41] represent dead denominationalism I want
[26:44] to represent something that has life in
[26:47] it so we're going to come to his table
[26:50] here shortly in a few minutes and you
[26:54] know I I I have it on my heart to ask
[26:56] you tonight as the Lord be began to
[26:58] speak to me today you know what are the
[27:01] reflections of our mind and where is
[27:05] your heart tonight and where will it be
[27:08] when you approach the Lord's table what
[27:12] will be the thoughts of your heart and
[27:15] how how do you see it how do you view it
[27:20] you know if you if you if you just have
[27:26] um so Gideon you don't have
[27:31] it it's it's on
[27:37] YouTube I see okay well we'll just forgo
[27:40] it then no worries when you when you
[27:44] approach the table of the Lord I think
[27:47] that it behooves us to consider you know
[27:51] what does it mean to me what and every
[27:55] person individually should ask
[27:57] themselves a question question tonight
[27:59] what does it mean to me tonight on this
[28:02] special night in this special service
[28:05] with this special
[28:06] activity I want to suggest to you today
[28:10] that you're not only at a special
[28:12] service not only do we have a special
[28:17] activity but I want to ask you you know
[28:20] uh what do you think about the end of
[28:24] this very special year
[28:28] was out for a walk today and I I felt
[28:31] the Lord speaking to my heart and
[28:33] through the morning I'd been pondering
[28:35] some different things and studying and
[28:38] and I I left the house it was a
[28:40] beautiful day and I wanted to take a
[28:41] walk and I kind of felt like I just want
[28:43] to be out under the under God's heaven
[28:46] and talk to him from my heart and and
[28:49] and and this is kind of where this whole
[28:52] burden That Came Upon me and I and I
[28:55] thought about it as a special year now
[28:57] you might say and you might fairly ask
[28:59] the question what is so special about
[29:03] this year perhaps it didn't maybe it
[29:05] doesn't feel all that special to you I
[29:07] don't know what any of us might could
[29:10] stand up in here tonight and say special
[29:13] nothing this year you know I had a I had
[29:15] this disappointment and I had that
[29:17] disappointment I I failed to realize
[29:19] this expectation and I I had this
[29:22] tragedy or I had this this problem and
[29:25] and you know I don't know that that what
[29:27] there would be to say about this year
[29:30] that would make it so special well could
[29:33] could I just tell you and and that's a
[29:35] fair question but you know I thought to
[29:38] myself when the Lord began to say you
[29:42] know what's going to be on your heart
[29:43] when you come to my table at this
[29:46] special time and and and I and I say to
[29:49] you tonight this was indeed a special
[29:51] year you say brother Jason what's so
[29:53] special about it well if for no other
[29:56] reason uh it's special special in that
[29:58] it's a year that had never existed until
[30:01] it
[30:03] dawned and all the history of humankind
[30:06] it had never existed this year had never
[30:10] been in the earth in all the time and
[30:14] and and not only that but a year that in
[30:18] passing will never be repeated again
[30:23] ever to infinity and beyond
[30:27] [Laughter]
[30:29] it'll never be
[30:30] repeated it's never existed it'll never
[30:34] be repeated I I'm GNA tell you something
[30:37] friends as I begin to ponder that I
[30:39] thought lord it's maybe it's a little
[30:41] more special than I gave it credit for
[30:44] and when I thought about that then I I
[30:46] took some time to think
[30:48] about how did I use the time of my
[30:53] special year how did I use it and how
[30:55] did I more more perfectly how did I
[30:59] utilize the time that God gave me cuz he
[31:02] didn't have
[31:03] to I lived the entire year and here it
[31:07] is the last night of the year and I'm
[31:09] still alive and you're still alive and
[31:11] we're still in it you don't know if
[31:13] you'll be in the next year you might not
[31:16] be there's many of people who will not
[31:18] see the morning's
[31:20] light and I trust that we all will and I
[31:23] trust that this coming weekend we'll all
[31:25] see all your lovely faces again but but
[31:28] that that's not my point my point is we
[31:30] are at the last hours of a very special
[31:35] year and we need to ask ourselves how
[31:39] did I use my time in this very special
[31:43] year that's passing and I have to say
[31:46] that when I pondered that I perhaps like
[31:49] you no doubt I had many mixed emotions
[31:53] as as as probably we all would perhaps
[31:57] but you know there because there's
[31:59] there's always um I suppose a great deal
[32:02] of uncertainty as to as to if nothing
[32:05] else as to what everything meant there
[32:07] are things that that you could list
[32:09] today I could have every one of us stand
[32:11] up and say go down a list and tell me
[32:14] the Milestones that happened to you in a
[32:15] year and only tell me the ones that you
[32:19] understand what was happening and why it
[32:21] happened I promise you wouldn't tell me
[32:22] all your happenings because we come to
[32:25] the end of a whole year and there are
[32:27] things that we even to this moment I'm
[32:29] getting ready to end this year and there
[32:32] are things in it I don't know why it
[32:35] happened perhaps I'll understand it
[32:38] better by and by perhaps the Lord will
[32:42] reveal it you know brother brandham said
[32:45] it like this he said God doesn't even
[32:47] tell His prophets everything right and
[32:50] it prophets don't tell the people
[32:52] everything you don't know the deep
[32:54] thoughts and ponderings of my heart I
[32:56] don't know yours God knows them I'm glad
[33:00] God knows them I'm glad I have a person
[33:02] I can just be completely honest with and
[33:05] I thought to myself Lord in the midst of
[33:07] all the times of uncertainty and all the
[33:10] things that I could point to that I'm
[33:12] very uncertain about and I don't know
[33:14] why this happened and I don't know why
[33:15] that happened but I said but Lord
[33:17] tonight when I come to your table here's
[33:20] something I'm very certain about at the
[33:22] end of this year I am still a Christian
[33:25] and I am still in love with you and
[33:27] still a believer of the word that you
[33:30] gave us in this hour and I said Lord I
[33:33] want to come to your table clean I want
[33:35] to have a clean mind and a clean heart
[33:38] and clean motives and clean objectives
[33:41] and I want to have clean gratitude to
[33:43] say whatever happened and whatever even
[33:45] I don't understand why it happened and
[33:47] maybe it wasn't always good but I know
[33:50] he loves me and I know he cares about me
[33:54] Hallelujah
[33:58] that's what I thought on this last
[34:01] special
[34:02] day of this very special
[34:08] Year good deal good deal G all right
[34:11] we'll use it I'll let you
[34:13] know you know we can we can look
[34:17] around in the world that
[34:20] we live in the world and its condition
[34:25] and can I just be real transparent
[34:27] parent tonight is that okay if I just be
[34:29] real honest I'm going to I'm going to
[34:31] help you be honest I'm going to say some
[34:34] things that you might not want to say
[34:35] out loud and I'm going to say it out
[34:36] loud for
[34:37] you okay we look around on the world and
[34:41] its
[34:43] condition and uh and sometimes wonder if
[34:46] the Lord has maybe left us here too
[34:51] long the world is
[34:53] becoming increasingly hopeless with each
[34:57] New Year and very often times we if we
[35:00] be honest we wonder how is it even
[35:02] continuing yes amen the madness is is is
[35:06] everywhere and you just think it can't
[35:08] go on much longer but I remember
[35:11] thinking that 5 10 years ago also and
[35:14] here we are approaching 2025 there's I
[35:17] promise you there's no one in the
[35:19] message that thought we would be at
[35:21] 2025 I can promise you none of those
[35:24] early uh you know my my parents and and
[35:27] and and the ones of that age group never
[35:29] in a million years but yet here we are
[35:33] and the world has not gotten better it
[35:36] hasn't even leveled off it's getting
[35:38] worse and worse and worse and you say
[35:41] Lord what in the world are you waiting
[35:44] for how how is this world even
[35:47] continuing to exist and how is it that
[35:50] you've still left us here but I want to
[35:52] say to you tonight the Lord is not slack
[35:55] concerning his promisen
[35:58] he's only patient waiting what is he
[36:01] waiting for he's he's waiting for that
[36:03] last name he's going to fill that role
[36:06] I'm here to tell you he's going to fill
[36:08] that role and and I I'm so glad for that
[36:12] tonight because I've got faith that I
[36:14] know some people who aren't on who
[36:16] aren't ready yet but they're going to be
[36:18] ready and if the Lord had a came at
[36:20] another year they would had a chance I'm
[36:22] glad tonight they still have a chance
[36:28] he must fill the role he's going to fill
[36:30] the
[36:31] role you know I thought it was rather
[36:35] amusing I amused myself thinking about
[36:37] it I thought you know yeah the Lord is
[36:41] patient he he doesn't wish anyone to be
[36:43] lost and he's he don't count him as
[36:45] slack he's not slack like the world
[36:48] counts
[36:49] slackness he's
[36:51] patient he's waiting for that last one
[36:54] to come in you know what if you were
[36:57] that last
[37:01] person you know I think Peter knew it'd
[37:03] be a problem with us I don't think we
[37:05] should feel bad to feel that way like
[37:07] Lord can we just be done can we just get
[37:10] on with it Heaven is such a beautiful
[37:12] place and we got so many loved ones over
[37:15] there but I got loved ones here that I
[37:17] want to be I want them to be over
[37:19] there oh and I just thought you know
[37:21] what if I was that very last person you
[37:24] know if I was that last person and I was
[37:27] still outside the fold I wouldn't want
[37:29] you to be in too big a
[37:31] hurry you know I I if I was the last
[37:34] person and you know when when morning
[37:37] Stars sang together and and sons of God
[37:40] shouted for joy and you know and we know
[37:43] and we we've taught on it before and
[37:44] it's somewhat ambiguous we don't have
[37:46] all the answers to it we don't know we
[37:49] we know that in the thoughts of God you
[37:50] existed we also know his thoughts are
[37:52] real we also know that there were
[37:54] morning stars that sang together and
[37:55] sons of God shouted for joy we know that
[37:58] the prophet talked about how you know
[38:00] you you were you existed before there
[38:03] was Stardust you existed and he started
[38:05] he makes various statements and parts of
[38:08] other statements and you kind of put
[38:09] them all together to get a narrative and
[38:11] he talks about you don't remember it now
[38:13] there I think in one place I read he
[38:15] said like a veil over your memory
[38:17] someday that Veil will be taken
[38:20] away so I don't know friends but but
[38:23] here but let me let me just let me just
[38:25] suppose for just a moment give me a
[38:27] little of license here that if there was
[38:29] a time when when we all were there and
[38:32] we were all morning stars and we were
[38:35] Suns and daughters and we were shouting
[38:36] for joy and brother brandham says the
[38:39] reason you were shouting is because you
[38:41] were you saw the Plan of Redemption and
[38:44] you realize what we're going to go to
[38:46] the Earth he's going to go we're going
[38:48] to go there's going to be this whole
[38:49] Redemption thing and then we're all
[38:51] going to come back here I'm here to tell
[38:53] you if I'd have been in that group and
[38:55] you and with you and then and then we'
[38:57] have went around around and it would
[38:58] have come back around to me and said
[38:59] guess what uh what you're you're going
[39:01] to be the last
[39:02] one okay well how's that going to work
[39:05] don't worry you won't get
[39:07] left but but there's going to be a veil
[39:10] over our memory we won't know that
[39:12] that's true but God's got it all in
[39:14] control don't worry but I'm here to tell
[39:17] you something friends and that may sound
[39:18] kooky to you but let me just play it out
[39:20] because this is the way it went into my
[39:21] mind today I thought if if I was that
[39:24] person and there's a veil over my over
[39:26] my memory and I'm the last one to go
[39:29] into the book I want to say to you all
[39:31] hey slow down don't you leave here
[39:34] without
[39:35] me oh I want to be in that number I want
[39:38] to be part of that redeemed family of
[39:40] God
[39:42] Amen when all y'all stars were singing
[39:45] and
[39:46] shouting I'd be the person I'd be the
[39:49] one going from person to person saying
[39:51] hey don't you try to leave without me
[39:53] yeah we're gonna have a veil we won't
[39:55] remember none of this but I'm telling
[39:56] you now we get back here and the veil is
[39:59] lifted you're going to remember I said
[40:01] to you don't you leave without me don't
[40:02] you even try
[40:07] amen you know
[40:10] Jesus standing at the temple there in
[40:14] Jerusalem that Herod
[40:16] built and he looked up looked upon it
[40:19] and said to the people and astonishing
[40:22] statement he said tear this Temple down
[40:26] and in 3 days I'll build it
[40:29] back that seemed
[40:32] insane and those people said all the you
[40:35] know I forget how many decades we were
[40:37] in building this and you by
[40:41] yourself it took thousands of people
[40:43] decades and you by yourself you're going
[40:44] to build it in three days now you know
[40:47] no wonder we said you've got a devil
[40:49] you're crazy but the Bible says what
[40:52] they didn't realize is is that he wasn't
[40:54] talking about that Temple cuz that
[40:56] Temple didn't matter the only Temple
[40:59] that mattered was the one he was
[41:00] standing in and it was going to be given
[41:03] on behalf of his family as a
[41:07] sacrifice
[41:09] so when when you think that through very
[41:13] deeply you
[41:15] realize that Jesus was going to
[41:19] allow his Temple to be torn down tear
[41:24] this tear this Temple down he was
[41:27] literally going to allow himself to be
[41:30] torn down to so that he could rebuild it
[41:34] for Resurrection amen amen that's what
[41:38] he was
[41:39] saying and they said you you're you're
[41:42] you we'll never let anyone hurt you and
[41:44] he said except a corn of wheat die it
[41:47] abideth alone and then he said I go away
[41:50] oh no what don't leave where you're
[41:51] going no no no it's better for you that
[41:53] I go because if I don't go he won't come
[41:57] see who you he huh who won't come I
[42:01] won't come I thought you're going yes
[42:03] but I will come to you I will live
[42:06] inside you so so I am this Temple is
[42:10] going to be torn down and and and and
[42:13] I'm tearing it down so that I can build
[42:15] it back for Resurrection because I don't
[42:17] want to be in heaven by myself I want a
[42:20] kingdom I want a family amen sometimes
[42:23] the Lord has to tear down things in our
[42:25] lives
[42:28] sometimes it's not just things in our
[42:29] lives sometimes it's our whole life yes
[42:32] amen sometimes we get so entrenched in
[42:35] our own in our own way and going our own
[42:37] Direction and we're we're nowhere near
[42:40] where God desires us to be and so a lot
[42:43] of times he has to start tearing things
[42:45] down amen might tear you know could be
[42:49] very heartbreaking stuff and and and and
[42:53] and and what to me what always is the
[42:55] saddest part when I see see the Lord
[42:57] having to use a a a supreme love a
[43:02] corrective love it's not judgment it's
[43:04] corrective love and when you see God
[43:07] have to do it that way to me always the
[43:10] saddest notion in my mind is that it
[43:12] need not have been and you suffered and
[43:15] it need not have been you you did it
[43:17] needlessly he was always going to win he
[43:20] was always going to get you and and and
[43:24] why did you why did you make yourself go
[43:26] the harder way and come the hard way I
[43:28] don't know friends we're just we're just
[43:30] broken humans it's all I can say but I'm
[43:33] glad somebody knows how to rebuild me if
[43:36] he has to tear me down and he's had to
[43:38] tear me down many of times he's had to
[43:40] tear down things in my life he's had to
[43:42] tear down things in your life sometimes
[43:44] he's had there's people who could
[43:46] testify and say my life was so in the
[43:50] left and right field I was so far off
[43:52] the straight and narrow he didn't have
[43:54] to just tear down parts of my life he
[43:56] had to tear my entire life to the ground
[44:00] yes amen amen so he could completely
[44:04] rebuild it he does it so that he can
[44:08] build things back he does it just like
[44:12] himself to build our life back for the
[44:17] resurrection
[44:19] amen these are the things get in have it
[44:23] let's go with it these are the things
[44:26] put it up and I'll tell you when to when
[44:27] to
[44:29] start these are the things that were on

[44:56] greater reality a greater sense of
[44:59] awareness that you're ending a year and

[45:07] year come in and you know if I have

[45:18] things that I want I want to let it pass

[51:52] 11 Gideon will go to the Y quote next
[52:00] Paul's speaking in 1 Corinthians 11:
[52:06] 23 for I
[52:08] have received of the Lord that which
[52:11] also I delivered unto
[52:13] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[52:16] in which he was betrayed took
[52:18] bread and when he had given thanks he
[52:21] break it and said take eat this is my
[52:25] body which is broken for you this do in
[52:29] remembrance of
[52:30] me after the same manner also he took
[52:33] the cup when he had sued saying this cup
[52:35] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[52:39] ye as of as you drink it in remembrance
[52:42] of
[52:43] me for as often as you eat this bread
[52:46] and drink this cup you do show the
[52:49] Lord's death till he
[52:50] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[52:53] bread and drink this cup one moment
[52:56] Luther and drink this cup of the Lord
[53:00] unworthily we're going to wait just a
[53:02] second wherefore whoo ever shall eat
[53:05] this bread and drink this cup of the
[53:07] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[53:10] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[53:14] examine himself and so let him eat of
[53:17] that bread and drink of that cup I I
[53:21] over the years when I read that
[53:24] passage I never read it and Come Away
[53:27] with a sense of for boing that you
[53:29] really shouldn't come up here what you
[53:32] should do is go before the Lord and let
[53:35] the lord judge your heart repent of
[53:38] anything wrong clear clear it with God
[53:41] clear your heart if anything but between
[53:43] you and another person clear it and then
[53:46] come and take the supper amen
[53:50] amen but let a man examine himself and
[53:52] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[53:54] of that cup for he that eateth and
[53:57] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[53:59] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[54:01] Lord's body see so this should be the
[54:04] thoughts of our mind as we come to the
[54:06] table you don't want to come up here and
[54:08] not discern his body properly
[54:12] see for this cause many are weak and
[54:14] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[54:17] we would judge ourselves we should not
[54:19] be judged I love this but when we are
[54:21] judged we are chastened of the Lord he
[54:24] corrects us that we should not be
[54:28] condemned with the
[54:30] world Amen I'm going to ask sister
[54:33] Deborah to come to the
[54:37] piano and I I've got

[1:08:54] reading from John ch CH
[1:08:56] 13 just carry on sister
[1:08:59] Ruth now before the Feast of feast of
[1:09:02] the
[1:09:05] Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
[1:09:08] was
[1:09:09] come that he should depart out of this
[1:09:11] world unto the
[1:09:13] father having loved his own which were
[1:09:16] in the world he loved them unto the
[1:09:20] end and supper being ended the devil
[1:09:24] having now put into the heart of Judas
[1:09:26] scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus
[1:09:29] knowing that the father had given all
[1:09:31] things into his hands and that he was
[1:09:34] come from God and went to God he riseth
[1:09:37] from supper laid aside his garments and
[1:09:39] took a towel and GED
[1:09:42] himself after that he poured water into
[1:09:44] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:09:46] feet to wipe them with the towel
[1:09:49] wherewith he was girded then cometh he
[1:09:51] to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him
[1:09:53] Lord does thou wash my feet
[1:09:57] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:09:59] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[1:10:02] know
[1:10:04] Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou
[1:10:06] shalt never wash my
[1:10:07] feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee
[1:10:10] not thou Hast no part with me Simon
[1:10:14] Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet
[1:10:17] only but also my hands and my head Jesus
[1:10:20] saith to him he that is washed needeth
[1:10:22] not save to wash his feet but is clean
[1:10:25] every Whip and you're clean but not all
[1:10:28] for he knew who should betray him
[1:10:31] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[1:10:35] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:10:36] had taken his garments and was set down
[1:10:38] again he said unto them know ye what I
[1:10:41] have done to you you call me master and
[1:10:44] Lord and you say well for so I am if I
[1:10:49] then your Lord and Master have washed
