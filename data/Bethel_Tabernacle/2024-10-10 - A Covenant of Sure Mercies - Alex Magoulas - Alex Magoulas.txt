to be uh we desire to express the very same one to another to comfort one another with these words and to encourage the downtrod and maybe to exhort the backslider to reach out to the lost tonight to anyone under the sound of my voice Lord to make your great compassions known tonight for it's the goodness of God that leadth us unto repentance even as the Apostle Paul has said father for this service tonight there's many needs assembled in this place many hearts that are that are needy to tonight Lord we are in needy people you knew this you know our frame that we're but dust and you pth us as small children but I'm so grateful tonight Lord You've not left us empty-handed you testified to us fear not little flock it is the Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and we've

needs father and all that is said and done we'll be careful to give you the praise and the glory and the honor for we ask it all in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the bride says amen amen God bless you if you have your Bibles tonight I invite you to turn with me into the scripture here in the book of Acts the 13th chapter and uh yeah this is I hope I get this thing is it good praise the Lord acts the 13th chapter um actually you could just follow me around if you want wouldn't that be wild you know I preached overseas you all want to know this story preached overseas years ago and uh the brother was preaching French and the guy was like 6 fo n the preacher 300 lb just a tower of a man and his interpreter his English interpreter was this little old guy about 5'4 and he had him like a ragile everywhere he went I thought man that looks like a wild ride man I'm I'm glad I'm not interpreted for that guy tonight so you don't have to worry about that I'm only 5'9 eight and a half but I got shoes on so who's counting uh Acts chapter 13 the Apostle Paul he comes here back to Antioch here um uh I believe he's with Silas and uh he gathers into a synagogue here in Acts chapter 13 and uh let's start the scripture says this after reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto him saying ye men and brethren if you have any word of exhortation for the people say on then Paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men of Israel and ye that fear God give audience the God of this people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt and with an high arm brought he them out of it and about the time of 40 years suffered he Their Manners in the wilderness that's a nice way say he put up with them being rude all the time he suffered their man suffered he Their Manners in the wilderness and when he had destroyed Seven Nations in the land of Canaan he divided their land to them by lot and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of 450 years until Samuel the prophet and afterward they desired a king and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their King to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfill all my will that's quite a testimony amen notice verse 23 of this man's seed ha God according to his promise raised unto Israel a savior Jesus now just for the sake of time tonight he rehearses the ministry of Jesus to these men and stuff we'll go down here to verse 33 and the Apostle Paul makes this point God hath fulfilled the same these promises he fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he hath raised up Jesus again as it is also written in the second Psalm Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he said on this wise I will give you the sure for mercies of David may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated tonight amen that's fine I'm used to this one anyway do I need to shut this one off are we good okay good praise the lord well anyway well yeah now I got the sound of thunder glory to God I sound like a preacher um I'd like to take for my thought tonight for a few moments here a covenant of sure mercies amen a covenant of sure mercies of course the apost sorry the prophet Isaiah this last scripture he's quoting the prophet Isaiah in the 55th chapter we'll come back to it here in just a little bit but uh we to to begin tonight we're looking at David of course he's a man after God's Own Heart and and God testifies to this and uh just want us to think for a few moments tonight on the life of David because David from the time he's a young man he's been anointed by the prophet Samuel to be the king of Israel and he's just a teenager a young man at the time and I think it's noteworthy to remember that David he does not inherit the throne immediately amen he's got this anointing over his life and by this anointing he's slayed a lion he slays a bear he slays a giant and yet he doesn't become king right away he doesn't become king in a year it actually some time passes from the time that he's anointed for this purpose to the time he comes into this position so we see him as a young man he gets a group of Gentile Warriors he gets this group of Warriors and he goes out and he fights Philistines amen and so he's got these men and they're going out and they're singing songs about David how Saul has killed his thousands and David has killed killed his 10 thousands and and we see that at the end of all this you know David has shown great kindness for Saul amen he's fought Saul's battles for him he's he's played music for Saul he's done all these things and he's been a friend to to Jonathan which is Saul's son so David's done all the every right thing and every kind thing he could for King Saul David's done every good thing amen and yet we find that Saul he repays his kindness by trying to take the life of David amen maybe you've worked with somebody like that before you know know somebody like that amen it seems like the nicer you are to some people the meaner they are to you can I get a witness tonight amen and what we find is that when Saul he's unable to kill David he throws javelins at him and everything else when he's unable to kill David on his own he gets a whole Army he gets a whole church he gets a whole group whatever it is and they're after David and David here's a young man he's been told he's going to be king he believes the promise and yet he finds himself farther away from the throne than he's ever been amen he's a fugitive he's living in the cave he's living on the Run amen and we we understand of course the Bible tells us that on more than one occasion David has an opportunity to even take the life of Saul amen but yet he he he looks at this and he refuses to do it he says who can touch the Lord's anointed and be blameless amen who can touch the Lord's anointed and be blameless now this is a I think a real good principle in David's life amen we see four different times the Bible tells us that he behaved himself why ly towards Saul amen and I think it's I think it's significant because we we recognize that you know David like I said for many nights for years he is uh laying under the stars he's a fugitive he's camping out and I wonder to myself sometimes how many how many nights did David lay there maybe the men are all asleep and he's just thinking to himself God has made a promise to me God has made a promise to you and I amen he's made promises over our lives and sometimes we don't see the Fulfillment immediately sometimes we wait a time and maybe we get discouraged amen sometimes you've got to encourage yourself like David did because you're looking at the promise you know God is true and yet your situation looks as far away from the materialization of what God said it could be amen you believe that God's A Healer and let you look at your body and you might be sicker tonight than you've ever been but God is still a Healer tonight amen amen you might be discouraged you might be going through something but let me testify God is still the same today amen he's he's looking at the situation he's done everything right amen it's one thing when you messed it up and there's plenty of people in that situation but David's done everything he's supposed to do he's honored this man he's submitted himself to God and he's even spared this man's life and yet he finds himself in this situation maybe wondering did I do the right thing should I have handle it differently amen but we understand when you when a man's ways please the Lord he makes even his enemy to be at peace with him the Bible says I was telling this story here just a little while ago but you know I had a I had a boss years ago maybe you've had a boss like this my my testimony is I I've had lots of bosses and most of them weren't that good at different jobs I worked in maybe maybe that's your story hope not but you know I've had I've had I had a guy one time he was the uh the shift supervisor in the shift I was working at and and he had a bone to pick with me he was he was trying to get me fired because his Department wasn't going the way that he wanted to go and he needed a scapegoat so I guess he picked me for whatever reason I must look like a must look like a troublemaker I don't know but he he he he tried to take me to the HR tried to get me fired tried to do all these things and and I thought about it and I prayed about it I said I could sit here and fuss with this guy and I could play the he said she said game with this but I looked at the guy that was in charge of hiring and firing I said listen my numbers I've got the best numbers on this ship that anybody's ever had now that's not just me bragging that's just me telling the truth amen I said I'll let my work speak for itself I man I'm not going to defend myself against this you put me in this position you let me stay here for a few weeks and if you don't like how my work looks you can fire me if you want amen and let me testify not only did I keep my job but that guy he ended up he he got into drugs he got in all kinds of problems he got moved he got demoted he eventually got fired amen and I'm saying this for a reason it's one thing if you and I fight our own battles amen we're going to get we're going to get a return on that equal to our own ability amen but the Bible tells us our God is a man of war and if you let God fight your battles if you let God handle the situation he can do a lot more than you and I can do tonight amen the Bible tells us David testifies of this in the 105th Psalm he's talking about uh he's talking about Abraham and Sarah when they wandered in the land of Canaan in the 14th verse of Psalm 105 the Bible says he speaking of God he suffered no man to do them wrong yay he reproved Kings for their sakes saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm well we're just going to do this now hope that's all right amen praise the Lord do my what what what's interesting to me about that that story is talking about ailec he takes Abraham's wife we're familiar with the story and God speaks to that king and the night of dream says if you touch her you're nothing but a dead man so when he's talking about not touching my anointed he's not just talking about the prophet Abraham he's talking about the wife that's his Covenant partner that's his spouse you touch her you're coming against the anointed of God you touch her and you and your nation you're dead and this man says listen I I did in the Integrity of my heart I didn't know God says I know you didn't know that's why I haven't killed you yet but you go to that lion Prophet you go to that man and tell him to pray for you and I will spare your house now you think about this Abraham we would look at and say Abraham is in the wrong but God made a covenant with Abraham and when he made that Covenant with Abraham he didn't say If Abraham was good if Abraham did what I always like if he never disobeys me but God made an unconditional Covenant with Abraham if you get out of the promise you might lose your blessing but you'll never lose the promise you'll never lose your position in your seed I will bless all nations God said it God spoke it God's going to bring it to pass this is not like the Covenant that God makes with them at Mount Si 400 years later well if you do this I'll bless you and if you do this I'll curse you surely blessing all right all right what that means surely blessing I'll bless Abraham in other words if I'm going to bless one person on the face of the Earth surely it's going to be Abraham if I bless no one else tonight surely it's going to be the Seed of Abraham if there's one person tonight walking out of here with the in it's the Seed of Abraham if nobody else gets anything from God Abraham's seed will be blessed he blessed your coming in I believe he's going to bless your going out he blessed your Uprising he's going to bless your Downs setting amen so we look at this with David David understands because he's been anointed and this anointing is what has allowed him to conquer Giants to conquer lions and bears to overcome adversity and David recognizes is the same anointing in the life of Saul Now listen Saul was was not a good king that's about the easiest way to say it I guess amen amen I didn't have elections like we do now so I'm not you know we not getting into politics but he didn't do a very good job amen and this man when he fails listen it's it's in the power of David to take his life but he recognizes the same anointing that put me in this position that is declared I'm going to be a king is the same anointing over his life if God put him in there God will take him out I mean it's not your job or my job tonight to take people out or to put people in if you're anointed you respect the anointing of God you understand you don't touch God's anointed amen praise the Lord somebody so David never has to listen David doesn't have to lay a finger on Saul amen he doesn't have to destroy Saul because Saul destroys himself through his Disobedience that this is why he hat hat David amen David's not out for his throne Saul has already lost the kingdom he just won't recognize it the prophet Samuel had already told him it's rent from your hands even this day so Saul's just trying to cling to something that he forfeited but God had made a promise to David that he would take this Lent he would be the king he'd be a commander and a captain over God's inheritance amen now I'm saying all to make this point you know David he's uh he's he's he's grown accustom for most of his youth his adult life he's lived outside I we got any people like camping in here I'm sorry I tell people this my idea of camping is like a motel like that's that's as rough as I get amen yall want to sleep on the hard ground and have bugs or man what is wrong with you people now you say no you shouldn't be saying that I but I got scripture for it amen because David has lived much of his life wandering as a fugitive wandering in the wilderness doing all these things and the Bible tells us in 2 Samuel the 7th chapter after he becomes king he has rest from all of his enemies and the Bible tells it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the Lord had given him rest roundabout from all of his enemies that the king said unto Nathan the prophet see now I dwell in a house of Cedar and but the Ark of God dwell within curtains and Nathan said to the king go and do that is all that is in thine heart for the Lord is with thee and it came to pass that night that the word of the Lord came to Nathan saying go and tell my servant David thus say the Lord shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle notice verse 7 in all the places where I walked with all the children of Israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of Israel whom I command to Feed My People Israel saying why build ye me not in House of Cedar now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David thus sayi the Lord of hosts I took thee from the Sheep coat from following the Sheep to be ruler over my people over Israel and I was with thee withs soever thou wentest can I get a witness tonight amen I have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight I have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the Earth moreover I will appoint a place for My People Israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more in other words they've wandered but they're not going to wander anymore because it's better to have a home than to live in a tent amen listen we are sojourning now in Tabernacles but this is not as good as the one we're going to in other words I've had a tent but a house is better than a tent and all the KN cappers said amen unless you got an RV that's basically glorified house tent something anyway amen amen notice this and is since the time that I commanded judges to be over My People Israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies also the Lord tell thee that he will make thee in house when thy days be fulfilled Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy seat after thee which shall proceed out of thy bows and I will establish his kingdom he shall build a house for my name and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom forever I will be his father and he shall be my son notice if you commit iniquity I will chasen him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men but oh I like that amen but you know if if brother Aaron comes to me and says he wants to borrow my new van I said you know brother Aaron I've known you for a long time and I sure love you I respect you but right then you know he's not getting the keys right there but my Mercy shall not depart away from him as I took it from Saul which I put away before them and thy house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee let me unpack this for you for just a minute Amen in other words David says I've got a nice house I've I've wandered in tents for a long time and now I finally got a house and David testified the house was better than the tent why is did I get a house but God has to live in a tent God should have a house and God says listen I never asked for for a house I didn't say I wanted a house but guess what I want a house it was well that you want listen David I didn't tell you that Flesh and Blood did not reveal that to you nobody said God wants a house but you realize because listen God allowed him to wander and to be a vagabond so that there would be something in his heart God allows us many times to go through experiences we go through things we wonder lots of times like David why am I going through this but God is trying to Foster something in our heart that we would see the bigger picture David Gets a house he doesn't just say praise God I got a house but he looks at his own life and he looks at God and says if I like the house better than the tent then God must want a house and God said it's well that it's with you I want a house you won't build but your son will build it and listen I took my Mercy from Saul amen I took my Mercy from Saul but you're different am see God is doing something here he has not done since the time of Abraham amen we say what makes this man David what makes him a man after God's Own Heart we could talk about his worship we could talk about his obedience we could talk about his courage but there's one thing that puts him apart from everyone else in the Bible amen we read it in Acts chapter 13 this is a man after my own heart he will do all my will other there's something I want done and I'm going to allow a desire in David's heart I'm not going to have to ask him I'm not going to have to beg him will help me out somebody sometimes we got to wait God will have to push us through a pipe he'll tell us and he'll tell us and he'll tell us listen I've sat there and counseled people before don't think any of them here tonight and they say what do we do in this situation well the Bible says this well the message says this well yeah I know it says that but I need to pray about it help me out somebody well I don't know I know it says that but oh no you're missing the point amen if God said it we believe it that settles it God shouldn't have to beg and brow be us into it and here's a man God doesn't even ask him but his least desire it's a commandment from almighty God what was David's desire what separates him he said there's one thing what was his desire amen there's one thing I've Des ired that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple his desire was a house for God and that desire is so great that God says I'm going to make a covenant with you amen and listen if your children disobey if they fail me I'll chasen them I'll correct them but unlike Saul my Mercy shall never depart from your family it shall never depart from your house your kingdom and your throne will be established forever amen so listen it's not every day God just makes a covenant it's not every day that God makes an unconditional Covenant but this desire was so great that God speaks to this this King and says your your kingdom your throne shall be established forever amen the prophet Isaiah calls it in Isaiah 55 it's a covenant amen it's not just the sure mercies of David amen but he says this let me find it here he says incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live I'm so glad tonight that we've heard amen we've heard from our theophany amen we're not feeding tonight on the words of a man we're feeding tonight on the unfailing body word of the son of man if you've heard and you've recognized you hear and your soul shall live he says he says I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you even the sure mercies of David amen I want you to think about Solomon for just a moment here because Solomon you know we look at the Antiquities look at Josephus and these different ones and Solomon has the greatest most prosperous wealthy Kingdom that's ever been on the face of the Earth probably ever in history amen God blessed him with gold he blessed him with wealth he gave him a Discerning heart he gave him wisdom why does God bless Solomon this way to build the house that David want to build Amen in other words God blessed Solomon for David's sake amen because David had a desire and God made a promise he blessed Solomon amen you say maybe tonight well I've got a son I've got a daughter I've got a loved I've got a loved one somewhere amen I'm praying for him listen the same faith that saved Noah's house is the same faith that it not just saved him it saved his house amen that's in the tonight amen you're not powerless you don't have to ring your hands amen we know God is in the business of saving children he's in the the business of saving grandchildren amen when the day of Pentecost comes and the promise of the Holy Ghost is given who is it given to it's unto you it's to your children to those that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen God tonight his his hand is not waxed short that it cannot save you say well there in this situation they're in that situation look what the kings of Judah got themselves into they had some good Kings they had a bunch of wicked Kings what's amazing to me about this you know the prophet Isaiah he talks about these sure mercies we see this in 2 Kings the 18th chapter amen when uh sen uh Senate cherub the king of Assyria he comes up against the cities of Judah he eventually comes to Jerusalem and the prophet Isaiah he goes to Hezekiah and he's told to prophesy to him now Hezekiah of course this is I think 400 years almost after the time of David amen Isaiah says this when when the city of Jerusalem is under siege he prophesies and he says for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a Remnant and they that escape out of Mount Zion the Zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this therefore thus sayith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields nor cast a bank against it by the way he came by the same shall he return He shall not come into this city sayith the Lord you say the devil's come against me I'm under a greater attack than I've ever been listen if I were you I'd declare war I'd let the devil know not only you're not coming to my house you're not coming on my property you're not coming near my children you'll not put one bankman up you'll not raise one spear you're not coming anywhere near me amen listen the Bible says he's going about ton not like a roaring lion seeking whom he can devour you know what that means he can't devour everybody if he's got to pick somebody that he can amen so if I were you tonight I'd make yourself a hard target make yourself the one with your token over your house with your sword drawn he can go by everybody else's house but when he gets to you says you know what I ain't going there tonight I mean it's too much work it's too much of a headache every time I go by that believer's house I get whipped amen I would let them know listen you can bother anybody you want but you're not coming anywhere near me I've got a word from the Lord I've got a token amen I've been told by a prophet of God that you can walk so close to God till the devil don't know what to do with you and we sit here and ring our hands well the devil this and the devil that and what are we going to do and life so hard listen if I were you I'd get into Christ I'd walk so close to God till the the devil don't know what to do with you the Bible said Jesus said you'll tread on I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing nothing shall by any means hurt you and we act like everything's going to hurt us the government's going to hurt us and disease is going to hurt us and the econom is going to hurt us and church people are going to hurt us listen nothing shall by any means hurt you and I tonight if fold our position in Christ Jesus that doesn't mean you're not going to have trouble what it means is a thousand might fall your side 10,000 might fall at your right hand but it's not going to come n me notice Isaiah says God is speaking he says for I will defend this city to save it for my own sake and for my servant David's sake I love this because again in Second Kings the same story 20th chapter Hezekiah Falls sick amen in those days he was sick under death and the prophet Isaiah he goes up there and he tells him listen set your house in order you're fixing to die and Isaiah walks out and Hezekiah turns towards the wall and he begins to pray said God I've been faithful I've tried to follow you in truth I've walked notice how he's pleading his own righteousness and I've walked before you a perfect heart I've done the right thing Lord would you spare me and the Bible says he begin to to weep sore and the prophet Isaiah he's delivered his prophecy he had nice midweek service he's already walking out well things are good and God says go back are you kidding me I just got out of there I'm going to look like I don't know what I'm talking about go right back in there and tell them thus sayi the Lord I've seen your tears I've heard your prayers so thus sayi the Lord I'm going to spare your life I'm going to add 15 years to your life and I will deliver this city out of the hand of the king of assy I will defend this city I'm going to spare your life for my sake and for my servant David's sake Hallelujah God I did all this I did this I prayed I did all that's fine I'll do it for David that's a little humbling is it you're sitting there pleading with God look at me Lord I've done all the right things God don't you see me yeah I'll do it for David's sake well glory to God and what's interesting now this is why this is interesting to me I I I looked at this here a while back we notice that 15 years later when Hezekiah dies his eight-year-old son Manassa inhs the throne what that means is seven years before manasse was born amen David or Hezekiah was supposed to die but God looked at Hezekiah and said no I've made a promise to David and because I made a promise to David I will not allow this man to die without an air and manasse we look at his life listen he spends much of his life in Disobedience he does wrong things but God allows him to go into captivity well praise the Lord maybe you got somebody there tonight in your own family God allows him to go into captivity and when he's in captivity the Bible said he called out to the Lord and He greatly humbled himself and God delivers him brings him back to Jerusalem and when he ends his life he's humble before the Lord for David's sake he spares Jerusalem for David's sake he spares Hezekiah for David's sake you say what's this got to do with me I'm not a child of David like that what I want you to see tonight is David had a desire and one man's desire for God one man's desire for a house for the Lord changed the fate of his family it sh shaped the direction of an entire Kingdom it saved Offspring hundreds of years later Offspring David knew never even knew he was going to have one man's desire amen we go back to this Temple that we're talking about a few moments ago I want to visit this because I want to I want to show you the extent of this Mercy because when Solomon dedicates this Temple amen he begins to speak about how God had seen this desire in David's heart he says and it was well God said it was well with David that it was in his heart that was the right thing David I didn't tell you you you your parents in here you ever see your kids do you know how it is when they're little and they do something wrong and you're like tell them you're sorry okay I'm sorry well listen if you're 18 years old and I have to tell you to say sorry it doesn't mean anything amen but when there's something in you that just wants to do it because it's the thing to do that's different and it was well in David's heart that he wanted to build this Temple amen and Solomon begins to pray he prays the glory of God comes down the temple so much that the ministers can't even stand and what I like about this is Solomon praed this dedication for this Temple now listen this Temple is just bricks and gold and all these things but Solon begins to pray and he says if your people are smitten before the enemy and they'll look toward this Temple and they will pray towards this Temple God will drive away the enemy if they find themselves under a pestilence if sickness comes and they'll turn towards this Temple now listen what makes this Temple special David wanted to build it David had mercy now the mercy is going to be in this Temple amen it's no longer just in David it's no longer just in his family but this Temple is going to embody these mercies if you're sick and you turn towards this Temple and you pray God will turn away the pestilence if they find themselves captive in another land and they turn toward this Temple and they pray God will set the captive free amen so salon's praying if people will look towards this Temple that David want to built for God they'll look there and pray the god of that Temple cuz that's where God's going to put his name if they'll look towards that place God will give them Mercy as well we see this in the time of Daniel when Daniel's in captivity and the decree goes out not for them not to pray to anybody you can only pray to the king what does Daniel do he goes up into his house he opens his shutters he looks toward Jerusalem the Bible says because he's a captive in a foreign land he looks toward Jerusalem and he begins to pray as he's always done and what's amazing to me about that there isn't actually a temple even there at this point it's literally just rocks on the ground it hasn't been rebelled but there was so much Mercy in the rubble of the ruins of that Temple that God would take a prophet and deliver him out of the mouth of lions wow amen oh my God's rich in Mercy tonight see he doesn't just have mercy he's rich in Mercy amen if God's rich in a thing it must be a pretty big deal listen the prophet Jonah one day when he he was supposed to go to Nineveh he's going the wrong way he gets tossed over you know the story he's in the great fish the great fish that God had prepared when he's in there amen the Bible says he said I cried by reason of my Affliction unto the Lord well I'm preaching to somebody tonight and he heard me out of the belly of hell out of the belly of Hell cried I I love how brother Ram dramatized this because if anybody had bad symptoms amen everywhere this Prophet looks everywhere listen Jonah doesn't have one encouragement to look at in this place amen he's in the belly of hell but he says Thou heardest my voice thou had cast me into the deep in the midst of the Seas the floods compassed me above all thy Billows and thy waves passed over me he said I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look again toward thy Holy Temple listen he doesn't have a GPS he doesn't have a Google C I don't know how he knew where to pray but by faith he knew if I look towards this Temple that same promise that God had made to Solomon that same promise to David God will deliver me out of the very belly of hell so these men want you to think about this they didn't just pray but they knew the right place to look when they prayed see lots of people pray to a god of history or denominational idea or some false god I've been listen I I've gotten off at airports in foreign countries and you know them Arabs they're they're just as they're just as punctual as can be praying right at this certain time of the day and I'm thinking man I hope they don't see me get on the plane that was the time to get on the plane because they weren't looking lots of people pray to lots of things but these men prayed and when they prayed they knew where to look there's a God that made a promise to a man by the name of David and God kept his promise to his offspring God always keeps his promise amen you see what's that going to do with me amen because we know where to pray because remember we read at the beginning Christ has received the sure mercies of David amen so tonight I'm not telling you we need to go pray to Jerusalem at the end of service what I'm saying is what they had as a type we have the real fulfillment of Amen you've got something better than a natural house which can be destroyed by Babylonians which can be destroyed by other governments amen you have received the house that God built sacrifice and offering or not but a body has been prepared for not just Temple we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost we are the place the Bride of Jesus Christ is the place that God has put his name so we're not looking tonight towards a natural Temple you're praying to the god that's in you you believe that listen the word of faith says he's he's not up in heaven where you have to pull him down he's not underneath What's the Word of Faith say it's nigh thee it's in your mouth it's in your heart the word of faith Paul said that we preach God is as close tonight as you'll let him be you say God just seems so far away he's as close tonight you'll let him be amen cuz we're not looking towards the god of History we're not looking towards things we're looking to the place that he put his name we're looking to the door within the door amen you say well brother you don't people do this amen we we look at this idea of Mercy well I've made mistakes I've done this I've done that you know it's it's so for some people you know let me say it this way Christians have this unique ability that most of the world doesn't have it's called the ability to repent amen and what that means is you have the ability that most people don't have to consider that the reason you have problems is you started it amen for most people 90% or more of their trouble they caused it and what happens many times amen now maybe maybe this is not where you're at tonight but for me for lots of people we're our own biggest critic amen we can show Mercy to our neighbor we can show Mercy to the person at church but we can't even show it to ourselves amen you say it's for everybody else but me you know I talk I talk to a uh I talked to a Believer here a while back and they were going through things in their life going through certain situations I said do you believe that God loves this person do you believe that God loves so love the world yeah I believe all that but do you believe that God loves you that way well I don't know amen when it comes to us we're not quite sold out on the idea we're not so sure but these men were so sure in a natural Temple they turned towards it and they prayed amen we how I made mistakes amen well David made mistakes you know it's funny we like David makes like I don't know how many mistakes like he makes two or three big ones and that's what we always remember amen amen you know you you get among a congregation you know I've preached different places in over the years and it's funny you know you look at brother Brandon he's going up to preach uh to the Chicago Ministerial Association and they want to comment a question on the serpent seed and water baptism and on the message of Grace and I'm thinking I thought that's what we believe was Grace amen they're going to what's just funny to me because people take this message and it's just a bunch of rules and a bunch of legalism and those guys thought he was preaching too much grace well I don't know I mean you know I mean I'm just like well they you know they they you this message They Don't Preach Jesus enough well you not listen to the message that brother Brandon preached because he had a woman come to him one day and said listen I love your ministry I love what you're saying but there's one fault with your ministry well if you just got one that's fine I guess I'd love to hear well you preach Jesus too much you brag about him too much oh you couldn't do that brother Brandon said oh man I wish I could brag on him more amen why cuz he's the place of Mercy tonight amen people say ah I never heard nothing about it well you're not listening to what this Prophet preached because he preached Jesus he preached the message of Grace amen amen and you look at David we look about his life amen and you begin to preach Grace you begin to preach mercy and usually there's some legalist somewhere he pops his head up says well now listen you get to preach in Mercy and Grace like that and and people are just going to start sinning all the time and what's funny to me about that is David has received a covenant of sure mercies amen now he intellectually understands he's got sure mercies but one day he goes and he takes them H A Woman by the name of Bas Sheba 's wife and he commits adultery with her he has UAH killed he takes this woman to be his wife and after all this he tries to hide it and the prophet Nathan comes to him one day and he lets him he begins to tell the parable we familiar with the parable I can sit here go over it 20 minutes if you want but but he goes over this parable about the man that took the one sheep the man that with many sheep he takes it and what does David say that man deserves to die not because he killed another human being but because he killed somebody else's animal he deserves to die and Nathan says listen you're the man you messed up you're the one that sinned against God Amen amen oh my probably the worst maybe the worst thing David ever did and here he's exposed and God said you did this secretly but I'm going to expose this openly because you've caused the enemies of God occasion to blasphemy against God and what does David do he says I have sinned against the Lord and the prophet Nathan he said something remarkable to me he says the Lord has also put away thy sin Thou shalt not die in other words before David even acknowledges his own sin his own failure the prophet said God already caused it to pass from you that's why David could turn around and now he can say by his experience blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin it's one thing to know you've got Mercy but at the lowest point of his life he recognized his sin was never even imputed to him and could rise up and testify blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin and what I love about that that doesn't cause David to sit there and go well listen I can do what I want I've done proved it I'll go send all I want he never does that again because when your desire is toward God and you receive Mercy I don't have to worry about you wanting to run around in sin amen you'll sin just as much I love I think brother Donnie said years ago you know I smoke as much as I want drink as much as I want cuz I don't want to and when David recognized the mercy of God it didn't cause him to go sin again it caused him to repent so this idea will you preach Mercy You Preach Grace people are going to go on sining not if they've got a heart like David's not if their desire is to do the will of God it will cause them to draw closer to God than they've ever been before I believe that's what this message is about I believe that's what the Capstone Ministry is about it's crying of Grace Grace when I recognize when you recognize it's no longer even imputed unto you that doesn't make you sit there and go I'll do whatever I want yeah what I want to do is dwell in the house of the Lord forever to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple I just want to be where you are dwelling daily in your presence the mercy of God didn't cause David to drift away from God that Drew him closer Drew him closer than he'd ever been before blessed is the man amen God was not looking at David's inability his sin he was looking at his desire amen listen lots of Christians come to church all over America they're looking every Sunday for a visitation we're going to have a move of God we're going to have a visitation amen what we need tonight is not just a visitation what we need to is be a habitation amen he said he that believes in me if I if he hears me if I knock on the door if he'll hear and open I will come in and Su with him amen I'm not looking to visit him on weekends this is not this is not some partial custody amen I want him to dwell with me amen he say I don't have gold pillars I don't have a basin I don't have an arc but you know what you've got tonight you've got a little room about this size about the size of a button in your heart brother B said and there's a soul that goes in there and if you'll invite God into that soul and you'll give him that heart and you'll give him your strength and you'll give him your might and you'll give him your life he will inhabit every fiber of your being that's the house I want to give tonight take this house cuz I know what this house has been through I know what it used to look like and I'm not what I want to be tonight I'm not where I ought to be but I can stand here tonight by the mercy of God and thank God I'm not what I used to be who made the difference you didn't make the difference God made the difference and the same God that changed your life the same God that brought you out of sin he did not bring you this far to leave you Hallelujah I've been like I said I've been preaching for a few years now and I I mentioned this to somebody the other day I said I've got two followers I don't know how many bethl Tabernacles got I've got two followers goodness and mercy David said they followed me all the days of my life when I wasn't looking for God when I wasn't serving him when I wanted nothing to do with God yet his good and his Mercy they still followed me and if they followed me back there they'll follow you tonight he's not failed you he's not left you he will not forsake you you're the habitation amen Moses was faithful as a servant over the house of God but Christ is a son over his house whose house you are see you're not just servants tonight David was a servant you're Sons and Daughters Jesus said the servant doesn't abide in the house forever but Sons do we got some Sons here tonight Sons abide in the house forever therefore because they abide in the house forever therefore if the son makes you free you are free indeed God oh my that's why brother Bam could preach eternal security amen not the way the Baptists preach it not well I said a sinner's prayer or I put my name on the church Ledger I shook hands let me say it this way not even well I believe God sent a prophet I believe the message that's just being able to read you can sympathize with the message and do that amen but eternal security comes because you're sealed with the Holy Ghost amen that's why I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen there's where your sure mercies are it's sure mercies you're sealed to the day of redemption and you are the Tabernacle of deity tonight you're the PowerHouse of God that's sure mercies oh my a desire want to be a habitation amen you know go back to David here for a second David he finds himself in this place he's sinned and he's he's he's displeased the Lord he's he's despised the Commandment of the Lord the scripture says and when Nathan confronts him about this and what he did he finds him in this place and he testifies of it in the Psalms where he lost the joy of his salvation I love brother BR over and over again he emphasizes this amen David never lost his salvation he just lost the joy of it amen you know I was talking to a brother years ago we were talking about say the joy of the Lord is your strength amen the joy of the Lord's your strength and this brother's like well listen the what is the kingdom says it's righteous peace and joy in the Holy Ghost the Bible doesn't contradict itself am mean the joy of the Lord is your strength amen that's why people get weak that's why why I can't pray like I used to I can't break through like I used to I just don't seem to enjoy the presence of the Lord like I used to it's not that I'm here tonight to condemn you it's not that you've lost your salvation you lose the joy of it amen listen when something gives you Joy like it did David that becomes your strength amen when you were in the world and you enjoyed going to concerts and you enjoyed smoking and you enjoyed drugs if you didn't have a dime in the bank amen you didn't have a dime in the bank you hadn't slept for 20 hours guess what you want to go bad enough you'll find a way to go you want to do something bad enough you'll find a way to do it amen and when you want to be in the presence of God when you want to Worship in the beauty of Holiness when you want to serve the Lord and that's your joy ain't nothing I can do ain't nothing the pastor nobody can stop you that's your joy that's your strength David loses the joy of it brother B makes this statement I think this is remarkable he makes this statement 1961 he says the holy spirit's here he said if You' Fallen weak lukewarm in your experience you'd like to be renewed Again David said restore to me the joy of my salvation he had not lost his salvation but he lost all the joy he says I think that goes to about 95% of the church today now I don't know if things have improved since 1961 my guess is from you Old-Timers the answer would probably be no amen The Joy they've lost the joy 95% probably talking at least one tonight that's 95% of the church today he said losing the joy of their salvation restore to me the joy of my salvation he said while the these people here are praying they begin praying would you like to come up get your joy restored the joy of your salvation that God might renew the blessings and your heart be full of his spirit and goodness come stand around the altar let's just come up renew our vows to God that's good he said sinner friend come with them backslider doesn't know God come with them sick or Afflicted come with them in other words whatever your situation is there's mercy here tonight it's not so much this altar it's the presence of God because he promised if two or three of us would gather together name he would be in our midst so there's mercy here tonight you look at Matthew 25 and we could go over this at Great length but there's people there's Nations that separated sheep and goats and there's a group of people they they gave drink to Jesus when he was thirsty they fed him when he was hungry they visited him when he was sick they came to him in prison when do we do these things as much as you did to the least of these am that's you and I tonight you did it unto me think about God he's he's so looking to show Mercy that one cup of cold water he will bless for his sake and for your sake if you give my disciple a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple so it's not just his sake it's like David it's your sake God so wants to show Mercy tonight and that's the unbeliever what about you and I tonight let us come boldly the scripture says unto the throne of grace that we may obtain Mercy find Grace to help in time of need would you stand tonight as the musicians would come brother BR begin to invite these different people whether it's the joy of the Lord they're sick whatever it is if you have a need tonight we'd be happy to pray with you whether you come don't come though I want you to be mindful tonight the mercy of God is so great to us amen if he would do that for David and his offspring if he would do that for the ones in error how much more tonight for us living under the light of a Vindicated word living in the Fulfillment of all these things we are such a blessed people amen you can wake up every day listen it's it's October 2024 you can look at politics and you can look at the economy you can look at the world around you and you have every reason like Jonah to be discouraged or you can look at the promise and listen I've never been more excited brother I've never felt more blessed I don't know how you feel about it tonight I've Never Been So Satisfied to know that I'm in

the Bible every time God's family would get in trouble even if they were culpable cuz that's generally what it is isn't it all right even if they had put their themselves in it God's mercy just kept coming again and again and again and again again and again are are you a witness of that can you say like David yes blessed is the man whom God will not impute unrighteous I thought about that I thought about God is always always from Genesis to Revelation many many times his family were sometimes put in necessary trials by the Lord but he always he's always merciful amen even times you know you say well wow some people you know not everybody fared fared so well well Hey listen even Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter and chose to suffer with the people and Paul said that there were some who received their dead to life but then others actually refused Deliverance because they were looking to something much better I just know this that wherever God is and wherever his family are and whatever the need is there's Mercy Hallelujah whatever has come between you and the Lord there's Mercy for you tonight amen you believe that tonight friends there's great Mercy I've always loved that brother Alex because where he says he did this for David's sake and then he did this for David's sake and I I just thought used to think to myself I remember being a as a teenager and I'd read that and I'd think my goodness David did way worse than I've ever done and I would sometimes I think there's no way he can have mercy on me than I think but wait a minute for David for David of all people for David's sake he would do this for David's sake he would do that I said oh he must love me too Hallelujah friends amen I want to sing that last verse again the last verse
