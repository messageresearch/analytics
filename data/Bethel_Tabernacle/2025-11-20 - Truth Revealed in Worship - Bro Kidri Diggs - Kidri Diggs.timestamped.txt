[18:16] Father, we love you this evening,
[18:19] Lord, and we just pray that you'd look
[18:21] beyond [music] all these fleshly faults
[18:23] in this vessel that we live in. Father,
[18:26] that you would come amongst us and just
[18:29] give us that reassurance, that peace
[18:32] that passes all understanding. Touch
[18:34] [music] each and every heart. Are we
[18:36] praying?
[18:37] Father, we thank you for this
[18:39] opportunity to gather together in this
[18:42] place that we set aside, Father, that we
[18:45] could just meet with you. Bring a pillar
[18:48] of fire.
[18:49] Touch our hearts. Father, bless those
[18:52] that are streaming. And Lord, [music] I
[18:54] just pray for those that are sick, maybe
[18:56] not here this evening, those that are
[18:58] streaming. I pray that you would be with
[19:00] each and every one. Father, as we
[19:03] collect the tithes and offerings, I pray
[19:04] that [music] you would bless the
[19:05] cheerful giver. Lord, I just pray that
[19:08] your spirit would move around the
[19:10] building, Lord, that you would look at
[19:12] each and every one of us, Father, and
[19:14] just help us to draw that much closer to
[19:16] you that we could leave better [music]
[19:18] than when we came in. In Jesus' name we
[19:21] pray. Amen.

[32:12] [applause]
[32:41] tears and sorrows,
[32:44] questions for [music and singing]
[32:45] tomorrow.
[32:47] There were times I didn't know right
[32:51] [music] from wrong.
[32:54] But in every [music and singing]
[32:56] situation,
[32:58] God gave blessed consolation
[33:02] that my trials [music and singing] only
[33:04] come to make me strong.
[33:10] Through it all,
[33:12] [singing]
[33:13] through it all,
[33:17] I've learned to trust in Jesus. [music]
[33:20] I've learned to trust in God. [music]
[33:23] Through
[33:25] it all,
[33:28] [music] through it all, [singing]
[33:31] I've learned [music] to depend upon his
[33:36] word.
[33:39] I've been a lot of [singing] places,
[33:42] [music] seen a lot of faces, yet there
[33:46] were times I [music] felt [singing] so
[33:49] all alone.
[33:53] But in my lonely hours,
[33:55] [music and singing]
[33:56] those precious lonely hours,
[34:00] Jesus let me know I was
[34:03] [music and singing] his own.
[34:07] Through it all,
[34:11] through [music and singing] it all,
[34:14] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[34:18] I've learned to trust in God.
[34:22] Through it [singing] all,
[34:25] through [music] it all,
[34:28] I've learned [singing] to depend upon
[34:32] his word.
[34:35] [music] Now I thank him for the
[34:38] mountains.
[34:40] Thank him for the [singing] valleys.
[34:43] Thank him for the storms he's [music]
[34:46] brought me through.
[34:49] Cuz if I never had a problem, I wouldn't
[34:54] know [music] how well God solves
[34:56] [singing] them. I'd never know what
[34:59] faith in his word can do.
[35:04] [music] Through it all, [singing]
[35:08] through it all,
[35:11] [music and singing]
[35:11] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[35:15] I've learned to trust in
[35:16] [music and singing] God.
[35:19] Through it all.
[35:23] Through it [music and singing] all,
[35:26] I've learned to depend [music] upon his
[35:30] word.
[35:32] Oh [singing] yes, I've learned to depend
[35:35] upon his word.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; [applause and music]
[35:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can just play
[35:52] something softly, Brother Andrew. We're
[35:53] going to invite Brother Diggs to come.
[35:55] Amen. How many's looking forward to the
[35:57] word?
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Wanted to just uh take a second. And I
[36:01] didn't get to do this Sunday. So I told
[36:04] brother Tony I wanted to tonight [music]
[36:05] um
[36:07] to tell about just an awesome testimony
[36:09] just before brother Digs comes out.
[36:12] Really just a [music] testimony that
[36:14] proves the mercy of God that uh the Lord
[36:17] never gives up. You know we give up on
[36:19] ourselves. We can give up on people. But
[36:22] there's one thing that's true. The Bible
[36:24] says that even when we're not faithful,
[36:26] he remains faithful.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. and his [music] mercy always comes
[36:30] after us. You remember the man who was
[36:32] here this Sunday uh came and splusted us
[36:36] with a special brother Marcus Turner. He
[36:38] is from Raleigh uh Durham area, North
[36:40] Carolina and it was real special having
[36:43] him um come [music] and uh last goodness
[36:47] I get I don't I'm so bad bad with dates.
[36:50] maybe a month and a half, two months
[36:51] ago, something like that, whenever it
[36:52] was right before camp, I had the honor
[36:54] to go and minister uh [music] the
[36:56] special meetings there. Brother Tim
[36:58] Puitz, myself, Brother Ron Spencer, and
[37:01] Brother Andrew Spencer. And um the
[37:05] evening that we were going to church
[37:07] [music] uh to Brother Ron Spencer was
[37:09] going to speak, we stayed in all of a
[37:11] house together and was able to have
[37:13] great fellowship um [clears throat]
[37:15] while we [music] were there. And so,
[37:16] Brother Ron was up in the front seat on
[37:19] the way to church and he says, "Brother
[37:20] Matthew says, there's this very special
[37:22] man here." He says, "I want you to
[37:23] meet." And he says just [music] an
[37:25] incredible testimony. I said, "Who is
[37:27] it?" He said, "His name is Brother
[37:28] Marcus Turner." He said, um, he is his
[37:30] first time ever coming to travel to be
[37:32] in meetings where I'm going to be. He's
[37:34] traveled here. [music]
[37:35] And he said, I tell you about the mercy
[37:37] of God. He said, 20 I think I get these
[37:39] dates wrong, but I think it was 23 years
[37:41] ago. He said, "23 years ago, I was
[37:44] coming back
[37:45] &gt;&gt; [music]
[37:45] &gt;&gt; uh preaching from a preaching trip." He
[37:46] said, "I was still in my suit, sweaty."
[37:48] And he said, "And the airline put me uh
[37:51] on a window seat beside a person who had
[37:55] too much alcohol."
[37:57] And he said just a chatter box. Guy was
[37:59] [music] just um just just chattering
[38:02] away. Wouldn't stop talking. And um and
[38:05] he said finally, you know, the whole
[38:06] ride, he said, "Finally, [music] the
[38:07] very end of the flight, he looked at me
[38:09] and said, "What do you do for a living?"
[38:10] and brother Ron said the first time I
[38:12] had a chance to speak the whole flight
[38:14] and he said well I'm a preacher [music]
[38:16] and he said really he said what do you
[38:17] preach he said well I preach the message
[38:19] of William Brandon and he said oh and
[38:22] [music] they kept talking was they were
[38:24] landing the man on the aisle who had
[38:25] been very quiet throughout the whole
[38:27] flight got brother Ron's attention
[38:29] [music] and he said sir he said um he
[38:31] said I used to be a message believer he
[38:33] said I used and he said really he said
[38:36] yeah I'm still a believer he [music]
[38:37] said but I'm just not in church he said
[38:39] I haven't been for many years. His life
[38:41] had just been real terrible. A lot of
[38:43] suffering, a lot of [music] um you know,
[38:45] you don't know what someone's you might
[38:47] look at them and judge them from the
[38:49] outside, but you don't know what's
[38:50] behind some of their life story. And
[38:53] that [music] brother has lived a life of
[38:55] a lot of tragedy, a lot of sorrow,
[38:57] things that you couldn't imagine. And uh
[38:59] anyway, he told brother Ronnie, he said,
[39:01] "I haven't been serving the Lord." He
[39:02] said, "I I think it's incredible [music]
[39:03] that I'm sitting beside a man who's a
[39:06] message preacher." And he said, you
[39:08] know, he said, ' And I'm out of
[39:08] fellowship with the Lord. And through
[39:10] that little airplane ride, [music]
[39:12] Brother Ron led that man back to the
[39:14] Lord Jesus. And as they got off the
[39:16] flight, as they got off in the terminal,
[39:18] Brother Ron said, you know, let's
[39:19] exchange numbers. I want to [music] get
[39:21] your contact. And this is 23 years ago.
[39:24] They didn't have cell phones, uh, you
[39:26] know, he could exchange. And [music] so
[39:27] he they get off the terminal and they
[39:29] lose track. He couldn't find him. He he
[39:31] looked everywhere. Brother Ron said he
[39:32] looked and looked and looked and looked
[39:34] and couldn't find him and was really
[39:36] bothered. said, "Man, Lord, why'd you,
[39:38] you know, let that happen? I really
[39:40] wanted to h I just got this man, you
[39:42] know, wanted to help him, see if I could
[39:43] set him right in his life, and, you
[39:45] know, just his life had fallen apart and
[39:47] crumbled." And Ron said, "I [music] lost
[39:49] track of him." He said, "Brother
[39:50] Maddie," he said, "The only thing I knew
[39:51] to do," he said, "Every special meeting
[39:53] that I would preach at," he said, "I
[39:55] would, before I'd preach, I'd say, if
[39:57] there's a man here in the building that
[39:58] I met on a plane, United Airlines, I I'm
[40:01] that preacher. Come and see me." And,
[40:03] uh, he said he did that for, I think, 15
[40:05] years. and finally just stopped. Never
[40:07] met the man. [music] In that interim
[40:10] time of 23 years, I believe his sister,
[40:14] it was his youngest sister, I think, I
[40:16] could tell that wrong, but it was his
[40:18] sister that said had had been attending
[40:20] brother [music] Ron's church. And uh and
[40:23] so brother Marcus had went to visit her
[40:25] or something to that something to that
[40:27] effect. Could get again [music] this
[40:29] detail wrong, but whatever it was,
[40:32] somehow she got Marcus to come to
[40:33] church. Now, he has no recollection or
[40:35] memory of Ron Spencer, who the man was
[40:37] he met on the plane, but he's there at
[40:39] the church in the fellowship. Paul came
[40:41] to [music] church and uh and and brother
[40:43] Ron, they were it just so happened that
[40:45] he got sat at brother Ron's table in the
[40:47] fellowship hall. Brother Ron said he was
[40:49] sitting there eating. He said, "A voice
[40:51] whispered in his in his ear and said,
[40:53] "The man you were looking for for those
[40:54] many years is sitting at your table."
[40:57] And he said, "I looked over at the man
[40:59] and thought, that's the man." And he
[41:01] said, I looked at him and said, "Sir,
[41:03] we've met before." And Marcus said, "No,
[41:06] sir, we've never met before. You got me
[41:07] confused with someone else." And brother
[41:09] [music] Ron said, "Airl."
[41:12] And he said, "When he said that, all of
[41:14] the memory." And he said, "Are you that
[41:15] preacher?" He said, "Yes, sir. That was
[41:17] me." And brother Ron got up on the on
[41:20] the the microphone they have there and
[41:22] said, "I want to announce the man I was
[41:24] looking for for 23 years is sitting here
[41:26] tonight at my table." And that restored
[41:29] that man back to the fellowship. Has
[41:31] been going to church serving the Lord
[41:32] ever since. And he told me that story
[41:35] Saturday [music] night before he
[41:36] preached. And at the sermon Saturday,
[41:37] Brother Ron had brother Marcus stand up
[41:39] as he told some testimonies. [music] And
[41:41] I watched uh Brother Marcus there just
[41:43] weep as brother Ron told it. Sunday
[41:46] morning I [music] spoke and um and
[41:48] brother Ron uh you know after I had to
[41:51] fly back because we had youth camp
[41:52] coming and brother Ron at the end of
[41:54] this [music] you know I spoke Sunday
[41:55] morning at the fellowship hall. I could
[41:57] eat really quick before I had to catch a
[41:58] flight. And brother Ron said, "Brother
[42:00] Matthew, did you get to meet Marcus?" I
[42:02] said, "No." I said, "I didn't get to
[42:04] meet him." He said, "Where is he?" So
[42:05] they're looking around for him. They
[42:06] can't find the man looking everywhere.
[42:08] Couldn't find him. I said, "I'm sorry,
[42:10] brother Ron. Maybe I'll just get a
[42:11] chance to meet him some other time." He
[42:13] said, "Oh, I want you to meet him so
[42:14] bad." About that time, Aaron Obsby said,
[42:16] "Brother Matt, you're going to miss your
[42:17] flight. [music] Let's go." So I got
[42:19] upgraded. Let me just tell you, for free
[42:20] your status, get you get some good
[42:22] things. I didn't pay for it, but I got
[42:24] upgraded the first class. And so I was
[42:27] getting on the flight. I was very wiped
[42:28] out. We'd went the weekend before,
[42:29] [music] just very tired. And so I sat in
[42:32] first class and and I immediately, never
[42:34] done this before, fell asleep. Put
[42:35] AirPods, [music] turned on the sermon of
[42:36] brother Brandham and just fell just
[42:38] blacked out. The steartus woke me up,
[42:40] said, "Sir, do you want a drink?" I
[42:41] said, "Yeah, I'll take a club soda." So
[42:43] I'm sitting there drinking my club soda,
[42:45] listening. And in my peripheral vision,
[42:48] I'm on the aisle and the man sitting to
[42:50] my left has a I see a phone that is like
[42:52] doing this. And I'm thinking, who is
[42:55] trying to [music] get my attention? And
[42:57] I and the phone's doing this. And
[42:59] finally, I look over and on the phone is
[43:01] me preaching that morning the replay.
[43:04] And now my brain didn't catch it for a
[43:06] minute. I thought, "What is happening?
[43:07] Why is there a person in first class
[43:09] watching me preach?" I looked over
[43:13] [music] and it's Brother Marcus and his
[43:14] eyes are about this big. And he goes, I
[43:16] changed my clothes. I was in casual. He
[43:17] said, "Is that you?"
[43:20] And I said, "Yeah." He goes, "Oh Lord,
[43:22] these plane rides have got to stop."
[43:24] [laughter]
[43:26] And he started weeping and and he
[43:28] started telling me those next two hours.
[43:30] He told me his whole life story. [music]
[43:33] I can't explain it, but God
[43:34] [clears throat] just put a special
[43:35] connection there. I was able just to be
[43:38] a blessing to him. He was a blessing to
[43:39] me. I prayed with him there at the
[43:41] terminal. [music] And ever since that
[43:42] day, we've been texting back and forth.
[43:44] Tell you what, friends, that is the
[43:46] [music] mercy that rewrites life. So,
[43:48] are you glad for that? Stand to your
[43:50] feet tonight. Give the Lord a good hand
[43:52] clap of praise for his grace. Thank you,
[43:55] Lord. [applause]
[43:57] Amen.
[43:59] We're excited to have Brother Diggs
[44:00] here. He's He's like one of us. So, you
[44:02] just make yourself feel at home. Mercy
[44:08] re [music]
[44:09] [singing]
[44:10] my life. Could you raise your hands?
[44:13] Sing it now like a testimony. God's
[44:17] mercy
[44:19] [music] reroll
[44:22] my life.
[44:25] [music]
[44:26] Oh, I should have
[44:28] I should
[44:31] have fallen
[44:33] [music]
[44:33] my soul [singing]
[44:36] cast down.
[44:45] my life. [music]
[44:47] Mercy,
[44:51] mercy
[44:55] all my life.
[45:02] Your mercy [music]
[45:06] broke my life.
[45:14] I
[45:17] have fallen. [music]
[45:20] My soul
[45:22] cast down
[45:25] by mercy [music]
[45:30] all
[45:31] my life.
[45:34] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[45:38] Good to be home again. Amen. Feel like
[45:41] I've been all the way around the world
[45:44] since we've been together. But God is
[45:46] good. Amen.
[45:48] I certainly appreciate testimonies like
[45:51] that cuz it shows no matter where you go
[45:54] or what you may do, God has always got
[45:56] [music] his eyes on you.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, the prophet of God said
[46:00] when that eagle laid, it knew how many
[46:02] eggs it laid and it [music] searched for
[46:04] the one until it found it. Amen. And he
[46:08] said that's like the Holy Spirit. God
[46:10] knows who has his seed and he'll send
[46:13] the Holy Spirit out to get every last
[46:16] one of us. Amen. We thank God for being
[46:18] here. We certainly appreciate Pastor
[46:20] Jason. Amen. Let's just have a word of
[46:22] prayer and we'll get right into the word
[46:23] of God. Lord Jesus, Father, we just
[46:26] thank you for the grace that you've
[46:28] given us, Lord. and
[46:29] &gt;&gt; your everlasting mercy, Lord, even when
[46:32] we don't deserve it,
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Lord God, and we run from you, Lord, and
[46:36] we try to live our own life, Lord, that
[46:38] you leave that mercy there, Lord. You
[46:40] leave that grace there, Lord. That
[46:42] favor, Lord, that unmmerited favor,
[46:45] Lord. And we thank you, Lord, for just
[46:46] keeping [music] your eyes on the
[46:47] sparrow, Lord, in our in our lives,
[46:50] Lord, even when we don't even realize,
[46:52] Lord, that you're watching over us,
[46:54] Lord. You're protecting, Lord, and
[46:56] you're keeping the enemy at bay. So,
[46:59] Lord, we appreciate you so much. And we
[47:00] pray that tonight, Lord, that you would
[47:03] dominate the service, Lord, our our
[47:05] minds, our spirits, Lord, down to the
[47:07] depths of our innermost being, Lord.
[47:09] Take full control, [music] Lord, and
[47:11] forgive us for everything that's not
[47:12] like you, Lord, and purge us, Lord, and
[47:16] continue to mold us into the image of
[47:17] your mind. In the great [music] and holy
[47:20] name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Church,
[47:22] say, "Amen."
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:24] Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles,
[47:27] let's turn to um St. John chapter 4.
[47:31] Again, we just appreciate you all so
[47:33] much. You know, all that you do, your
[47:36] prayers, support so many different ways.
[47:39] You know, those who are here, those who
[47:40] are online. Amen. God is good.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; St. John chapter 4,
[47:49] let's start at verse 21.
[47:52] St. John 4 and 21 Jesus saith unto
[47:56] heroman believe me the hour cometh when
[48:01] ye shall neither in this mountain nor
[48:04] yet at Jerusalem
[48:07] worship the Father ye worship ye know
[48:11] not what we know what we worship for
[48:15] salvation is of the Jews but the hour
[48:19] cometh and now is when The true
[48:22] worshipper shall worship the father in
[48:25] spirit and in truth. For the father
[48:28] seeketh such to worship him. God is a
[48:32] spirit and they that worship him must
[48:35] worship him in spirit and in truth.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord have a blessed reader
[48:40] of his word. You can have your seats.
[48:43] Amen. Praise the Lord. Tonight by the by
[48:48] the grace of God I want to use for a
[48:50] subject truth
[48:52] revealed in worship.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; You know just the the the word worship
[49:04] it can go so many different ways,
[49:07] you know, because everybody has their
[49:09] own idea of what they think worship is.
[49:13] But tonight I I kind of want to look at
[49:15] it from a different way. Amen. You know,
[49:18] but uh the Bible says that God is a
[49:20] spirit and for any of us to worship, we
[49:23] must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; But church, I want to say that when it
[49:28] comes to worship, our greatest hindrance
[49:32] is something that I it it really not God
[49:36] is not really dealing with when it comes
[49:39] to worship. BUT YOU KNOW, ONE OF OUR
[49:41] GREATEST HINDRANCES when it comes to
[49:43] worship is sound.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; And when WE SPEAK OF WORSHIP, WORSHIP IS
[49:49] NOT BASED UPON SOUND.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE CHURCH, IF WE GO IN IN IN the in
[49:54] the word and uh before I get to going,
[49:57] you know, the prophet when they when
[49:59] when when he talked about worship,
[50:01] listen what he said. He said, "I LIKE TO
[50:04] WORSHIP." CAN I GET AMEN?
[50:07] &gt;&gt; I LIKE TO WORSHIP. HE SAYS, "DON'T YOU?"
[50:11] HE SAYS, "NOW, WE DON'T COME TO CHURCH
[50:14] JUST TO HEAR A SERMON." WOW.
[50:17] [laughter]
[50:18] &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT'S A SHOCKER FOR A LOT OF
[50:20] CHURCH PEOPLE. AMEN.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; THAT WE, YOU KNOW, FOR YEARS, WE'VE SAID
[50:24] BECAUSE OF THE REVELATION OF THE word
[50:25] and and you know, the end time message
[50:28] and what the prophet HAS BROUGHT FORTH,
[50:30] WE COME AND SAY, "I GOT THE WORD.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; I COME TO HEAR the word." AND NOW THE
[50:35] PROPHET IS SAYING, "WE DON'T COME HERE
[50:36] ONLY JUST TO HEAR A SERMON."
[50:38] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AMEN.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; SO YOUR WORSHIP, AMEN, IS VERY
[50:42] IMPORTANT. HE SAYS, "WE DON'T COME HERE
[50:45] JUST TO HEAR A SERMON. THAT GOES WITH
[50:47] IT. BUT WE COME TO CHURCH TO WORSHIP."
[50:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; I hope I hope y'all didn't think I was
[51:02] going to let you get by WITH THAT.
[51:05] WE DON'T COME TO CHURCH JUST TO HEAR THE
[51:09] WORD PREACH,
[51:10] &gt;&gt; BUT WE COME TO WORSHIP.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; That's kind of weak, but we going to
[51:17] keep going.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "BUT WE COME TO CHURCH TO
[51:21] WORSHIP. WORSHIP IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH.
[51:24] You've heard the truth." AMEN.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WORD. SEE, WE'VE HEARD THE
[51:29] TRUTH OVER AND OVER AND OVER. SO, WE GOT
[51:31] THE WORD. AMEN.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE WORD. BUT THEN HE SAYS, HE
[51:36] SAYS THAT'S THE WORD. SEE NOW TO WORSHIP
[51:39] IS TO EXPRESS YOURSELF to him.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; NOW THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO GO CHURCH.
[51:45] WE WANT TO WE WANT TO EXAMINE OURSELVES
[51:47] AND SAY THAT WHEN WE COME TO CHURCH, ARE
[51:50] YOU EXPRESSING YOURSELF?
[51:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
[51:54] JUMPING AND SHOUTING, KICKING AND
[51:55] HOLLERING, BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR
[51:58] RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; OR BETTER YET, WHAT'S YOUR IMAGE OF GOD?
[52:04] BECAUSE UH THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID THAT
[52:06] THE WORD GOD MEANS AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; SO IF WE'RE HERE TONIGHT AND WE'RE
[52:12] WORSHIPING, THERE HAS TO BE AN OBJECT
[52:14] THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE AN OBJECT THAT YOU'RE
[52:18] BELIEVING IN. AMEN. AND A LOT OF TIMES
[52:21] PEOPLE DON'T WORSHIP BECAUSE THEY DON'T
[52:23] BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE IN THE PRESENCE OF
[52:24] GOD.
[52:27] MY AND WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL LAY THE
[52:31] WORSHIP ON ALL KIND OF THINGS, YOU KNOW.
[52:33] Oh man, brother Tony didn't SING MY
[52:35] SONG. THAT AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH
[52:37] IT.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, WELL, WELL, CHRIS WASN'T
[52:40] BEATING THE DRUMS, RIGHT?" THAT AIN'T
[52:41] GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, THEY DIDN'T HIT THE KEY
[52:44] RIGHT." NO, THAT'S SOUND. THAT'S NOT
[52:46] WORSHIP.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; WORSHIP IS THE EXPRESSION, HALLELUJAH,
[52:51] OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN GOD. WHAT GOD HAS
[52:55] BEEN REVEALED UNTO YOU. AMEN.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; NOW, we going to go somewhere.
[52:59] Hallelujah. AND I KNOW YOU MAY BE
[53:01] LOOKING AT me and YOU SAY, "MAN, HE'S
[53:03] REAL RADICAL AND ALL THIS STUFF." YOU
[53:05] KNOW, OUR OWN PERSONALITIES HAS NOTHING
[53:08] TO DO WITH IT.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; WORSHIP IS [screaming] A REVELATION.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN REVEALED TO YOU.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; AND THE ONE WE COME TO WORSHIP IS WHO?
[53:19] JESUS.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; SO, AMEN. YOUR REVELATION OF CHRIST
[53:23] SHOULD BE UH EXPRESSED IN YOUR WORSHIP.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my. AND I KNOW THAT WHEN IT COMES TO
[53:31] WORSHIP AND PRAISE AND ALL THESE THINGS
[53:33] THAT IT'S A TOUCHY AREA. KEEP IN MIND
[53:37] I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SOUND.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Come on. [laughter]
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz some of you WANT TO LOCK YOU WANT TO
[53:45] LOCK ME INTO THAT. YOU THINKING ABOUT
[53:47] SOUND. YOU THINKING ABOUT BLUEG GRASS
[53:49] AND purple grass and all kind of grass
[53:52] &gt;&gt; and country AND GOSPEL AND HIP HOP AND
[53:55] ALL. NO, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT. I'M
[53:58] TALKING ABOUT A LIFE.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:05] NOW, don't get me wrong,
[54:07] THE PIANO, KEYBOARD, ALL THAT STUFF, IT
[54:09] PLAYS A PART.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, THERE'S A
[54:14] PERSON MAKING THE SOUND.
[54:18] HALLELUJAH. Oh my. SO HE SAID WORSHIP IS
[54:23] THE EXPRESSION HALLELUJAH OF GOD.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; NOW LOOK IF WE GO INTO IT LET'S LOOK AT
[54:29] SOME OF THE FIRST PLACES WHERE WE'VE
[54:31] SEEN WORSHIP. YOU KNOW THE BIBLE SAYS
[54:35] THAT GOD IN THE BEGINNING WOULD COME
[54:38] DOWN IN THE COOL OF the day.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; And in THE COOL OF THE DAY ADAM AND EVE
[54:42] WOULD DO WHAT? THEY WOULD WORSHIP GOD.
[54:46] I GUARANTEE YOU WITH ALL MY MIGHT, THERE
[54:50] WAS NO PIANO THERE.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO KEYBOARD THERE.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT WAS THE WORSHIP ALL ABOUT? IT
[55:01] WAS ABOUT HALLELUJAH. OH MY.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; THE REVELATION OF GOD BEING REVEALED
[55:08] RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THEM. AMEN.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; AND I GUARANTEE YOU, THEY DIDN'T JUST
[55:13] SIT THERE, BUT THEY OFFERED UP AN
[55:15] EXPRESSION TO GOD.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE HE WAS RIGHT
[55:19] THERE IN HIS IN THEIR MIDST. THINK ABOUT
[55:22] IT. DO YOU BELIEVE GOD IS HERE?
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Now ask yourself, did I worship like he
[55:27] was here?
[55:31] &gt;&gt; You say the music wasn't jumping. I
[55:33] ain't talking about the music.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; And I'mma keep doing that because some
[55:37] of you going to try to pull me. You know
[55:39] where the sound is and you know uh Aaron
[55:42] wasn't thump Aaron wasn't thumping loud
[55:44] enough. [laughter]
[55:46] Now I love a good thump. Now
[55:49] &gt;&gt; don't get me wrong now. I love some GOOD
[55:51] MUSIC. HALLELUJAH. BUT LET ME ASK YOU
[55:53] SOMETHING. IN YOUR CAR, IS THERE A
[55:55] PIANO?
[55:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOU [screaming] ON YOUR
[56:00] JOB, YOU DON'T HAVE AN ORCHESTRA.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT WHEN YOU YOU MAY BE THINKING
[56:04] ABOUT GOD AND SOMETHING TOUCHES YOUR
[56:06] HEART AND YOU MAY LIFT UP YOUR HANDS AND
[56:08] DO WHAT? WORSHIP. WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S A
[56:11] REVELATION. THAT'S SOME TRUTH BEING
[56:14] REVEALED to you.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. BUT AS WE LOOK CHURCH, LET
[56:19] WE SEE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE FIRST
[56:21] PLACES, HALLELUJAH, WHERE WORSHIP was
[56:24] given unto God. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
[56:26] WITH A SOUND.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; It was all about life.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now church,
[56:35] LOOK. ADAM AND EVE, GOD CAME DOWN AND
[56:38] THEY WORSHIPED HIM.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; NOW, WE'RE GOING to move AHEAD A LITTLE
[56:40] BIT FORWARD. ADAM AND [screaming] EVE
[56:43] HAD TWO BOYS, CAIN AND ABEL. AND THE
[56:47] BIBLE SAYS IN THE PROCESS OF TIME, THEY
[56:50] CAME UNTO GOD TO DO WHAT? OFFER
[56:52] SACRIFICE.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT WAS THE OFFERING OF SACRIFICE?
[56:57] IT WAS CONSIDERED A WHAT? WORSHIP.
[57:00] M HALLELUJAH. BUT IT WASN'T HOW GOOD
[57:03] THEY PLAYED THE INSTRUMENT. HALLELUJAH.
[57:06] IT WAS BASED UPON THE REVELATION OF THE
[57:09] SACRIFICE THEY OFFERED TO GOD.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE THESE TWO BOYS AND CAIN, HE
[57:15] COMES FIRST AND HE DOES WHAT? HE WORSHIP
[57:18] GOD. BUT HE WORSHIPS GOD BASED UPON HIS
[57:21] REVELATION.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Still there were no drones beating.
[57:28] There was no keyboard.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; What's that thing called? You play
[57:32] &gt;&gt; bro.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; There was no dough, bro.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; IT WAS BASED UPON A SURRENDERED LIFE.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; AND HERE COMES CAIN. NOW, HE WAS WILLING
[57:49] TO OFFER GOD A SACRIFICE OF PRAISE. BUT
[57:52] HIS SACRIFICE,
[57:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT HE OFFERED UP GOD, GOD DIDN'T WANT.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; WHAT HE OFFERED UP GOD DIDN'T MATCH UP
[58:02] TO THE LIFE OF WHAT GOD IS.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; HE MADE GOD SOME NICE, PRETTY, SHINY
[58:10] FRUIT.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OR WHATEVER IT WAS. IT MIGHT
[58:15] HAVE BEEN SOME VEGETABLES OR WHATEVER IT
[58:17] WAS THAT HE OFFERED UP TO GOD. GOD.
[58:20] HALLELUJAH. SAID, "GET THAT MESS OUT OF
[58:22] HERE."
[58:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Still had nothing to do with sound.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; NOW HE OFFERS UP AND GOD REJECTS HIS
[58:35] WORSHIP. AND NOW HERE COMES HIS BROTHER.
[58:38] HIS BROTHER COMES AND HE BEGINS TO LAY
[58:40] IT OUT. AMEN. NOW YOU LOOK AT WHAT HIS
[58:42] BROTHER DID. HIS BROTHER CAME TO GOD
[58:45] WITH WHAT? A life.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND AS HE'S PULLING THAT
[58:50] LAMB, HE'S HE'S BRINGING IT IN AND HE'S
[58:52] BRINGING IT DOWN. AND IT GETS REAL MESSY
[58:55] SOMETIMES.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAIN'S
[59:00] OFFERING AND ABEL'S OFFERING. ONE WAS
[59:02] MESSY AND ONE WAS PRETTY.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; And sometimes
[59:11] &gt;&gt; we don't give God worship because we
[59:12] want to stay cute and pretty.
[59:16] Hallelujah.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't, you know, and and
[59:20] I'm so sick of this, you know, we don't
[59:22] give God worship because I'm an
[59:24] introvert.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; I WONDER HOW MANY INTROVERTS GOING TO BE
[59:32] IN HEAVEN.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; You think you're GOING TO BE ABLE TO
[59:37] CONTROL YOUR WORSHIP IN HEAVEN?
[59:40] &gt;&gt; IMAGINE GOD. HALLELUJAH. THE ONE THAT
[59:43] DELIVERED US FROM EVERYTHING AND NOW WE
[59:45] MADE IT OVER. YOU IN HIS PRESENCE. YOU
[59:47] SAY, "WELL, GOD, THAT'S JUST NOT ME."
[59:50] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, GOD, I'M QUIET BY
[59:52] NATURE."
[59:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AGAIN, I'M NOT TRYING TO GET
[59:55] YOU TO JUMP AND SHOUT, BUT I WANT YOU TO
[59:58] UNDERSTAND, DO YOU REALLY EXPRESS
[1:00:00] WORSHIP TO GOD,
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; OR DO YOU JUST GIVE HIM WHAT YOU THINK
[1:00:04] IS ACCEPTABLE?
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; CAIN DID THAT. CAIN GAVE HIM WHAT HE
[1:00:08] THOUGHT WAS ACCEPTABLE AND GOD REJECTED
[1:00:11] IT.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS THE FIRST FRUITS OF HIS
[1:00:14] OFFERING. IT WASN'T SOME OLD NASTY,
[1:00:17] DIRTY THINGS WITH WITH MAGGOTS AND AND
[1:00:19] ME DO ALL IN IT. IT WAS SOMETHING
[1:00:21] WORTHY.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WASN'T WORTHY ENOUGH TO REVEAL
[1:00:25] WHAT GOD'S LIFE IS.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; AND NOW HERE COMES CAIN. HERE COMES
[1:00:30] ABEL. ABEL HAS HALLELUJAH THE LAMB. HE'S
[1:00:33] BRINGING IT. AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAY
[1:00:35] HE MAY GET A ROCK AND HE STARTED TO HACK
[1:00:37] ON IT AND BLOOD IS SHOOTING ALL OVER THE
[1:00:39] PLACE. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT
[1:00:41] WORSHIP. WHAT WAS IT DOING? IT WAS
[1:00:44] REVEALING HALLELUJAH THAT GOD IS A
[1:00:48] FORGIVER.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; IT WAS ALSO REVEALING truth
[1:00:58] that Adam and Eve did something.
[1:01:02] Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; OH MY.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; HIS WORSHIP STARTED TO BRING OUT SIN
[1:01:08] THAT WAS STANDING THERE AND IT ALSO
[1:01:10] BROUGHT OUT FORGIVENESS. HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; THROUGH THE SAME SACRIFICIAL OFFERING.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BY HIM GIVING OFFERING UP
[1:01:19] THAT LAMB. IT SHOWED CHURCH. HE WASN'T
[1:01:21] THERE WHEN GOD KILLED AN ANIMAL AND HIS
[1:01:24] MOTHER AND HIS FATHER WALKED OUT
[1:01:26] DRIPPING IN BLOOD.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; SO HOW DID HE PICK IT UP? IT WAS A
[1:01:29] REVELATION THAT HE GOT INTO WORSHIP.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; And what did it do? IT REVEALED THE
[1:01:36] LIFE. YOUR WORSHIP, MY WORSHIP. IT
[1:01:39] SHOULD BRING US BACK TO CHRIST.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT SHOULD SHOW AND IDENTIFY
[1:01:44] THE ONE THAT WE BELIEVE IN.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU THINK ABOUT IT. LOOK AT ABEL'S
[1:01:48] WORSHIP. WHAT DID IT DO? IT SHOWED IN
[1:01:51] HIS WORSHIP. IT SHOWED THE LIFE OF
[1:01:53] CHRIST ON DISPLAY BEFORE THERE WAS EVEN
[1:01:56] A DEATH, BURIAL, AND RESURRECTION.
[1:01:58] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And it said that his worship spoke of
[1:02:02] things to come.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT US?
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT OUR
[1:02:10] WORSHIP?
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES IT SPEAK OF? HALLELUJAH.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; DOES IT TELL WHO GOD IS? HOW GREAT HE IS
[1:02:17] AND WHAT HE'S DONE AND WHAT HE WILL DO
[1:02:19] OR ARE WE JUST SINGING SONGS?
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. If we see that and we look and we
[1:02:28] see what God did in this moment through
[1:02:32] Abel as Abel worship and God begin to
[1:02:36] reveal things to him and you can look
[1:02:38] and see Adam and Eve maybe on the side
[1:02:40] watching him as he's worshiping THEY MAY
[1:02:44] HALLELUJAH CAIN MAY have looked at it
[1:02:45] AND THOUGHT THAT'S TOO much
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; right
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; do we have TO DO ALL THAT I DON'T FEEL
[1:02:51] LIKE CLAPPING MY hands
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; when THE BIBLE SAYS CLAP YE HANDS, ALL
[1:02:57] ye saints.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU CLAPPED YOUR
[1:03:01] HANDS IN CHURCH?
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; That's what the BIBLE SAYS. DON'T PUT IT
[1:03:05] ON ME. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THE PROPHET
[1:03:07] OF GOD SAYS GOD LOVES TO BE WORSHIPED.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, CHURCH. LOOK, I'M GOING TO
[1:03:14] GET BACK TO THIS, BUT LOOK, CHURCH, WHEN
[1:03:16] GOD, WE KNOW THE PROPHET SAID WHEN GOD
[1:03:18] WAS, DON'T GET NERVOUS. I'M ABOUT to
[1:03:19] close.
[1:03:21] REMEMBER, HE SAID WHEN GOD WAS ALL
[1:03:23] ALONE, HE WAS JUST ETERNAL. AMEN.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING HE WANTED TO
[1:03:28] COME OUT.
[1:03:30] OH MY.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my. SO HE STARTED TO CONDESCEND. WHAT
[1:03:34] WAS HE DOING? HE WAS UNVEILING HIMSELF.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; AND THEN HE HE WAS GOING THROUGH THE
[1:03:39] STAGES OF UNVEILING HIMSELF. BUT
[1:03:42] HALLELUJAH. HE WANTED MORE THAN JUST TO
[1:03:45] UNVEIL HIMSELF, CHURCH. HE CREATED
[1:03:48] ANGELS. WHY? TO WORSHIP HIM.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. LISTEN, I GUARANTEE YOU THERE WAS
[1:03:55] NO PIANO THERE.
[1:03:59] [snorts]
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Now the difference is
[1:04:04] they worshiped out of duty.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Why do you worship?
[1:04:10] [laughter]
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Every time they came IN GOD'S PRESENCE,
[1:04:13] THEY BOWED DOWN AND THEY SAID, "HOLY,
[1:04:15] HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY,
[1:04:18] HOLY, HOLY, Lord God Almighty, HOLY,
[1:04:19] HOLY, HOLY." NOTHING ELSE COULD COME OUT
[1:04:21] OF THEIR MOUTH. They were created to
[1:04:23] give God that kind of worship.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; But then you and I, HALLELUJAH, WHO'VE
[1:04:27] GONE THROUGH SOMETHING, HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; WHO WHO WHO HAD UPS, WHO'VE HAD DOWNS.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; AT TIMES WHEN WE FELT LIKE WE WERE LOST,
[1:04:35] AT TIMES WHEN WE WERE FELT LIKE WE WERE
[1:04:37] ALL ALONE. OUR WORSHIP SHOULD COME FROM
[1:04:39] ANOTHER PLACE.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; NOT FROM DUTY. IT SHOULD COME FROM
[1:04:44] GRATITUDE.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; IT SHOULD COME FROM SOME THANKSGIVING.
[1:04:47] IT SAY ENTER INTO HIS GATES. AMEN.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; ENTER INTO HIS COURTS.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving and praise.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Still, I ain't mention a instrument yet.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; So, where is it coming from?
[1:05:07] It has to be a revelation.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Think about it, church.
[1:05:13] Now you get to the place
[1:05:16] where God is just in some places he's
[1:05:19] trying to get us to understand that he
[1:05:22] requires worship.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Let's go to uh Exodus chapter 15.
[1:05:29] This is just coming to me. Y'all know
[1:05:30] I'm a shotgun preacher, so just bear
[1:05:33] with me as I keep loading
[1:05:37] cuz I do believe in blasting.
[1:05:40] Hallelujah.
[1:05:43] Are you with me, church?
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:47] See,
[1:05:49] I ain't got much that I can control. BUT
[1:05:52] ONE THING I can control is I can be a
[1:05:54] worshshiper.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING. THAT'S
[1:05:59] WHEN IT'S SNOWING. THAT'S WHEN THE
[1:06:01] BUFORD MOSQUITOES THAT ARE THIS BIG
[1:06:03] FLYING AROUND.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I CAN STILL BE A
[1:06:06] WORSHSHIPER. THE CONDITIONS OF THE EARTH
[1:06:09] CAN'T STOP ME FROM WORSHIPING
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S A REVELATION.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT DON'T MATTER WHO
[1:06:16] PREACHING. IT DON'T MATTER WHO SINGING.
[1:06:18] HALLELUJAH. GOD HAS BEEN GOOD TO ME.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SEE, CHURCH, THAT'S WHAT IT
[1:06:24] COMES DOWN TO. YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF,
[1:06:26] HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS GOD TO YOU?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; WHO HAS HE BEEN TO YOU?
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; WHAT WILL HE BE TO YOU? AMEN. AND THEN
[1:06:35] YOU PUT THAT IN FRONT OF YOU BEFORE YOU
[1:06:37] WORSHIP.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; But church, look in in in in Exodus uh
[1:06:44] 15 verse one, IT SAYS, "THEN SANG MOSES
[1:06:47] AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL uh this song
[1:06:50] unto THE LORD, AND SPAKE, SAYING, I WILL
[1:06:53] SING unto the Lord, for he hath
[1:06:56] TRIUMPHED GLORIOUSLY. THE HORSE AND HIS
[1:06:59] RIDER HAVE HE DROWNED IN THE SEA." NOW,
[1:07:02] WHO'S GOING TO TELL THEM PEOPLE NOT TO
[1:07:03] SING that song?
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID,
[1:07:08] "I'MMA TAKE YOU THERE." THIS IS AFTER
[1:07:10] THEY CAME THROUGH THE RED SEA.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD SAY, "NOW, MIRIAM
[1:07:14] GRABBED THE TAMBOURINE."
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; But we know they only play that in black
[1:07:20] churches.
[1:07:22] [laughter]
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; That's foolery.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; NOBODY HAS A PATENT ON WORSHIP.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:34] I KNOW WE WANT TO DO IT. WE WANT TO MAKE
[1:07:37] WE WANT TO MAKE WORSHIP A CULTURE. BUT
[1:07:39] IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. IT'S A
[1:07:41] REVELATION.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; YES. SOME PEOPLE DO IT DIFFERENT. SOME
[1:07:45] PEOPLE DO IT LOUD. SOME PEOPLE DO IT
[1:07:47] QUIET. BUT THE GREATEST THING WE CAN DO
[1:07:49] IS DO IT BY REVELATION. [cheering]
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHAT WAS HAPPENING? WHY WERE
[1:07:55] THEY SINGING THAT SONG? BECAUSE THE
[1:07:57] PROPHET OF GOD SAID THEY CAME THROUGH
[1:07:59] THE SEA. HALLELUJAH. BUT THEY CAME
[1:08:01] THROUGH ON DRY GROUND.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T IT WASN'T A WISHY-WASHY
[1:08:05] REVELATION WHETHER GOD WAS A DELIVERER
[1:08:07] OR NOT.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; IT WAS SOMETHING SOLID TO THEM.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; SO THEY WERE WORSHIPING BASED UPON WHAT
[1:08:13] GOD HAS DONE IN THEIR LIVES.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T JUST A TESTIMONY OF MOSES
[1:08:19] CHURCH. WE DON'T WORSHIP JUST BECAUSE
[1:08:21] GOD SENT US A PROPHET. WE ARE A PART OF
[1:08:24] WHAT GOD SENT.
[1:08:26] HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND WORSHIP IS A PROGRESSIVE
[1:08:32] REVELATION CUZ GOD HAD TO TEACH OUR
[1:08:35] PROPHET HOW TO WORSHIP.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; You better read your message.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, like we do sometimes.
[1:08:46] Now, we going to get into the sound part
[1:08:47] of it a little bit. Hallelujah. He was
[1:08:49] in his church and HE SAID SOME
[1:08:51] PENTECOSTALS CAME to his church
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; and they begin to worship
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; like they normally do.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going steal something I heard
[1:09:00] from pastor.
[1:09:02] HE SAID WHEN WE GO INTO PRAYER HE SAID
[1:09:06] BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING YOU MUST FIRST
[1:09:09] COME TO NEUTRAL.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [snorts]
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW, I was just in Australia
[1:09:15] with with brother Jack,
[1:09:18] brother Aaron, me, brother Larry.
[1:09:22] And look,
[1:09:24] in Florida,
[1:09:26] they don't worship THE SAME WAY JESUS
[1:09:28] CHRIST tabernacle in in Colombia.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; AND [snorts] IN COLOMBIA, WE DON'T
[1:09:33] WORSHIP THE SAME WAY THEY DO IN A HUSKY.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; AND THUS, HALLELUJAH, BETHL TABERNACLE.
[1:09:40] BUT DOES THAT mean it's not acceptable?
[1:09:45] [laughter]
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S A REVELATION.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HOW IT LOOKS.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HOW IT SOUNDS.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT IT'S REVEALING.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IN THE MOMENT WHEN
[1:09:59] MIRIAM GRABBED THE TAMBOURINE AND SHE
[1:10:01] STARTED TO DANCING, WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS
[1:10:03] REVEALING THAT GOD IS A DELIVERER.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T ABOUT THE SOUND. IT WASN'T
[1:10:09] ABOUT THE INSTRUMENT. IT WAS ABOUT WHAT
[1:10:11] GOD HAS DONE FOR THE BELIEVER. AND
[1:10:13] THAT'S WHAT YOUR WORSHIP SHOULD DO. IT
[1:10:15] SHOULD LET ALL US KNOW. IT SHOULD
[1:10:17] EXPRESS. IT SHOULD LET ALL US KNOW WHO
[1:10:20] GOD IS TO YOU.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; AND MIRIAM, HALLELUJAH, START THE
[1:10:24] DANCING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE WASN'T
[1:10:26] THE ONLY ONE.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; So when I found out, Brother Brad,
[1:10:33] you know, I've been called radical,
[1:10:37] but I know I ain't the only one. I
[1:10:39] didn't saw you worship.
[1:10:43] [laughter]
[1:10:44] Hallelujah.
[1:10:46] Oh my. And me and him didn't exchange
[1:10:48] some songs. So I know he got some
[1:10:51] radicalism. I'm going to make up a word
[1:10:53] radicalism in him. Hallelujah.
[1:10:57] But there are times when I might not
[1:11:00] feel like jumping. I might feel like
[1:11:01] crying.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; It's still an expression.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; See, what I want to show tonight by the
[1:11:09] grace of God is put your patent away.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; And come to neutral.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; See, when I come here, hallelujah, Y'ALL
[1:11:20] DON'T SING EXACTLY HOW JESUS CHRIST
[1:11:22] TABERNACLE SING,
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT IT'S THE REVELATION OF WHAT'S
[1:11:26] being sown.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I messed WITH TONY BEFORE I
[1:11:29] CAME. I SAID, "HEY, I'm I'm, you know,
[1:11:31] I'm telling I'm going to be there
[1:11:32] tonight." I said, "Hey, I need you. I
[1:11:34] just want to pour
[1:11:41] my
[1:11:43] [snorts]
[1:11:46] See, that's me when I'm saying it.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; I'm getting into it cuz that's just who
[1:11:50] I am."
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF I'M GOING TO POUR TO GOD,
[1:11:53] YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU POURING YOUR
[1:11:55] BEST DRINK, ARE YOU JUST LOOKING AT IT
[1:11:57] like this? Oh boy, I don't really feel
[1:12:00] like drinking that. I'm so thirsty, but
[1:12:03] this ain't going to do too much for me,
[1:12:05] so I'm going just pour. But if it's a
[1:12:07] hot day,
[1:12:10] [snorts] it's a hot day and you know our
[1:12:11] humidity is crazy.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a hot day and you got a
[1:12:15] nice drink and you pouring it. You know
[1:12:17] when a child is about to eat a good
[1:12:19] meal, they start singing.
[1:12:23] I just wanna
[1:12:27] I just wanna
[1:12:30] you [laughter]
[1:12:31] SEE THAT'S ME THAT'S MY THAT'S ME
[1:12:33] EXPRESSING HALLELUJAH BECAUSE TO ME
[1:12:36] HALLELUJAH WHEN I THINK ABOUT HOW GOOD
[1:12:38] GOD HAS BEEN HELP BUT move around
[1:12:41] sometimes
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; I CAN'T HELP BUT CLAP MY HANDS I CAN'T
[1:12:45] HELP BUT RUN AND SHOUT THAT'S JUST THE
[1:12:47] WAY GOD HAS ALLOWED ME TO EXPRESS
[1:12:49] CONCEPT.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; THAT DON'T mean it's the
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; patent
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; cuz Tony may just do this.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; That don't mean, you know, I'm that
[1:13:06] DON'T MEAN HE RIGHT AND I'M WRONG.
[1:13:10] You notice I didn't say that the other
[1:13:11] way around
[1:13:13] cuz most OF US THINK QUIETNESS IS GOD.
[1:13:16] AND IT IS IN SOME CASES. YES.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU SAY, "WELL, HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:21] THE PROPHET TALKED ABOUT A STILL SMALL
[1:13:23] VOICE." YES, HE IS A STILL SMALL VOICE.
[1:13:26] BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.
[1:13:27] THE SAME GOD, THE SAME SCRIPTURES
[1:13:30] TALKING TO THE SAME PROPHET, HE SAID
[1:13:32] WHEN GOD BEGIN TO MOVE, THERE WAS AN
[1:13:34] EARTHQUAKE.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; AND SOMETIMES WORSHIP IS A THUNDER.
[1:13:39] HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SHAKE UP THE PLACE.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; WE JUMP, WE SHOUT, WE HAVE A GOOD TIME.
[1:13:44] THE BIBLE ALSO SAYS, HALLELUJAH, WHEN
[1:13:46] GOD BE TO MOVE, THERE WAS A FIRE.
[1:13:49] HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; WORSHIP BURNING OUT THE SIN IN OUR
[1:13:52] LIVES.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND HE ALSO SAID,
[1:13:55] HALLELUJAH. THERE WAS A RUSHING WIND.
[1:13:57] HALLELUJAH. ALL OF THAT WAS HAPPENING
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE still small voice.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; But all of it was God.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Just in that moment, God wanted to
[1:14:09] express through a still small voice.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:14] So don't give me all that.
[1:14:20] I can only imagine
[1:14:25] teachers on
[1:14:27] Hallelujah.
[1:14:29] But think about it, church. There have
[1:14:32] been places where God begin to express
[1:14:35] Hallelujah. where saints saints of GOD
[1:14:37] BEGIN TO EXPRESS through worship how
[1:14:39] great God was.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got the quote, but I I'm
[1:14:42] just for the sake of time, I'mma
[1:14:43] paraphrase. He said when THEY CAME ON
[1:14:46] THE OTHER SIDE, HALLELUJAH,
[1:14:48] of the other side OF THE SEA, HE SAID
[1:14:50] MIRIAM GRABBED THE TAMBOURINE AND SHE
[1:14:53] STARTED TO DANCING and singing.
[1:14:54] HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WAS
[1:14:56] SINGING? MOSES.
[1:14:59] [laughter]
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; MOSES WAS LEADING THE WORSHIP.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; And I think that's the part we forget
[1:15:05] sometimes.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet laid it out.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hey, look church. HE SAID,
[1:15:12] "WHY WERE THEY DANCING? WHY WAS MIRIAM
[1:15:14] DANCING?" HE SAID SHE LOOKED BEHIND HER
[1:15:18] AND ALL OF HER PROBLEMS WAS DROWNING IN
[1:15:20] THE SEA.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; EVERY SICKNESS, EVERY TRIAL, EVERY
[1:15:26] TRIBULATION, EVERY BAD THOUGHT SHE EVER
[1:15:28] HAD IN EGYPT WAS DROWNING IN THE SEA.
[1:15:31] NOW, WHO GOING TO TELL THAT WOMAN NOT TO
[1:15:33] WORSHIP?
[1:15:36] AMEN.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT EXPERIENCED WHAT
[1:15:39] SHE EXPERIENCED, WHO GOING TO TELL THEM
[1:15:41] TO BE QUIET?
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; IT WAS BIGGER THAN A SOUND.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; IT WAS FREEDOM.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; REAL WORSHIP, IT EXPRESSES FREEDOM.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; And the reason why some people can't
[1:15:57] worship is because they still bound.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we're bound in our minds
[1:16:02] to our own thoughts.
[1:16:04] It got to sound this way. I got to act
[1:16:06] this way. I got to clap with this beat.
[1:16:08] All this all this foolishness.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; God wants a life.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Little church.
[1:16:21] The prophet said they came to his church
[1:16:24] and he said they had a washboard,
[1:16:27] a washboard AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT
[1:16:29] THINGS and they start to let it go in
[1:16:31] church. Come on.
[1:16:38] And you know, he looked at that and he
[1:16:41] said, "Turning my church into a tavern."
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; See, he wasn't that neutral.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; He was listening to the sound, looking
[1:16:52] at the instruments, not realizing that
[1:16:54] these people are worshiping because God
[1:16:57] has revealed something.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; He says he was sitting there in the seat
[1:17:05] of the
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; scornful.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; See, HE WASN'T AT NEUTRAL.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, BUT THEN HE ASKED THE QUESTION.
[1:17:11] THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETIMES. WE
[1:17:12] NEED TO TALK TO God and take our eyes
[1:17:15] off one another.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; So he SAYS TO GOD, LORD, SHOW ME WHERE
[1:17:19] IS SCRIPTURE.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, GOD TOOK HIM TO MIRIAM.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; A WOMAN DANCING AND SHOUTING BY
[1:17:26] REVELATION.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE SHE WAS ONCE BOUND BUT NOW
[1:17:30] SHE'S SET FREE.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; SO BEFORE YOU CRITICIZE SOMETHING,
[1:17:36] HALLELUJAH, FIND OUT THAT PERSON'S
[1:17:38] STORY.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I ALWAYS SAY, AMEN. SOMEBODY
[1:17:42] GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD MY MULE BECAUSE
[1:17:43] GOD HEALED ME FROM BRAIN CANCER AND YOU
[1:17:46] DON'T WANT ME TO SHOUT IN YOUR CHURCH,
[1:17:48] I'M SORRY.
[1:17:53] I WAS IN A HOSPITAL FOR 18 WEEKS
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; AND GOD IN THE MOMENT OF A TWINKLE OF AN
[1:17:57] EYE TOOK IT ALL AWAY.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; AND YOU DON'T WANT ME TO EXPRESS THAT
[1:18:02] GOD IS A HEALER.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT MY WORSHIP IS DOING. IT'S
[1:18:05] EXPRESSING THAT GOD IS A HEALER.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A SOUND.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:17] And too often we criticize something
[1:18:18] without understanding
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; what's behind that worship.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; And the prophet is criticizing
[1:18:25] based upon the sound.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "And now God takes him to marry
[1:18:31] him." He what I love about God, God will
[1:18:34] give you what you ask for.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "Show me where scripture took
[1:18:37] him to Mariam.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Then he took him to David."
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And David
[1:18:46] started to worship. Why was he
[1:18:48] worshiping? Why was he dancing?
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; And you know, critics were there
[1:18:52] watching him.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Even his very own loved ones. Don't you
[1:18:55] let your family shut you down.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Jason. Don't mind.
[1:19:02] But one thing I've observed,
[1:19:06] parents,
[1:19:07] I want you to watch your children.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; They doing what they see you do.
[1:19:14] YOU SAID THEY NOT INVOLVED. THEY DON'T
[1:19:16] CLAP THEIR HANDS. Next time WHEN YOU GET
[1:19:18] THAT THOUGHT, THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU
[1:19:20] DOING.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz I asked a young man in church one
[1:19:24] time. I said, "Hey, one of my little
[1:19:26] buddies, I said, "Man, I noticed you
[1:19:28] wasn't clapping your hands. You weren't
[1:19:30] singing. You wasn't doing nothing."
[1:19:32] He said, "Well, my mom and dad don't
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The effect you have. HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:43] IN YOUR HOUSE.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; NOT THROUGH SOUND, THROUGH LIFE.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LET'S GO BACK TO CAIN AND
[1:19:50] ABEL, EVERYBODY. ALL RIGHT.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; LOOK, WHEN IT CAME TO CAIN AND ABEL,
[1:19:54] HALLELUJAH. THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
[1:19:57] ABOUT DEVIL WORSHIP.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; WHO WAS THE SONG LEADER IN THE HOUSE?
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; ADAM.
[1:20:11] AND ALL ADAM KNEW WAS GOD.
[1:20:14] Let's keep in mind THE SERPENT NEVER HAD
[1:20:17] A CONVERSATION WITH ADAM.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; AND BY THE TIME THEY MET, GOD WAS
[1:20:23] HANDING OUT CURSES.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO BY THE TIME IF HE WOULD
[1:20:27] HAVE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH GOD WITH
[1:20:29] WITH ADAM, HE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE
[1:20:31] BECAUSE GOD TOOK THE SERPENT, MADE HIM
[1:20:33] COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, PUT HIM ON HIS
[1:20:35] BELLY,
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; WAS NO LONGER TALKING. SO HE COULDN'T
[1:20:38] INFLUENCE ADAM'S WORSHIP.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So then these two boys go to
[1:20:47] worship. Where did Kane get it from?
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; It was just who he was.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; And it just came out because Adam didn't
[1:20:58] teach him that.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All Adam knew was the
[1:21:02] presence of God.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; All he knew WAS THE GOODNESS OF GOD.
[1:21:07] EVEN THOUGH HE FELL INTO SIN, ALL HE
[1:21:09] COULD REMEMBER WAS HOW GOOD GOD WAS, HOW
[1:21:13] GOOD GOD IS. ALL HE COULD DO WAS GIVE
[1:21:15] GOD PRAISE.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU WORSHIP, IT HAS TO
[1:21:19] BE YOUR OWN PERSONAL REVELATION.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; YOU BEING IN A MESSAGE CHURCH IS NOT
[1:21:24] GOOD ENOUGH.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.
[1:21:29] THE DEVIL IS IN A MESSAGE CHURCH, TOO.
[1:21:34] AMEN.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Trying to hinder the worship.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; And sometimes influencing it.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; We singing and you sitting there like
[1:21:44] this.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; You're just expressing
[1:21:51] what God means to you.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But you look and you see these
[1:21:57] two boys. They started to worshiping and
[1:21:59] Cain and Abel started worshiping, you
[1:22:01] know, and Cain may have looked at Abel.
[1:22:04] He said, "Nah, that's that's just too
[1:22:05] much, brother. Digs, you doing too much.
[1:22:08] Look at you. YOU SWEATING LIKE YOU'RE
[1:22:09] SHOOTING BASKETBALL. You're just doing
[1:22:11] too much, man. We we all we need to do
[1:22:13] is play some nice soft nice soft uh uh
[1:22:17] uh uh Maverick City.
[1:22:22] Some some some Bethl worship. Something
[1:22:24] real soft and nice." And you know, YOU
[1:22:27] THINK ABOUT THAT, THAT sound good.
[1:22:29] Hallelujah. But then church,
[1:22:32] WHAT KANE CRITICIZED,
[1:22:35] GOD, WHAT HE WHAT CAIN CRITICIZED AND HE
[1:22:37] THOUGHT WASN'T WORTHY ENOUGH, WHEN GOD
[1:22:40] REJECTED HIM, GOD SAID, "HEY, IF YOU DO
[1:22:42] LIKE YOUR BROTHER,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; THE VERY ONE YOU MIGHT THINK IS TOO
[1:22:47] RADICAL IS THE VERY ONE GETTING GOD'S
[1:22:49] ATTENTION."
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHETHER IT BE CRYING,
[1:22:52] WHETHER IT BE SINGING, WHATEVER IT MAY
[1:22:53] BE. HALLELUJAH. WHATEVER YOU MAY BE
[1:22:55] CRITICIZING MAY BE THE VERY THING THAT'S
[1:22:58] PLEASING TO GOD.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; WHAT? BECAUSE GOD IS LOOKING FOR A LIFE.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND NOW HE TELLS HIM, "HEY,
[1:23:06] DO LIKE YOUR BROTHER. WORSHIP LIKE HIM
[1:23:08] AND YOU'LL BE ACCEPTED."
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; SAY, "NO, I can't do it.
[1:23:14] Can't do it."
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; But then as God kept moving, different
[1:23:18] one start to worship. worship began to
[1:23:20] change mask. Look church,
[1:23:23] why did God set the children of Israel
[1:23:25] free?
[1:23:27] The Bible says he heard they cried. He
[1:23:30] heard, you know, their agony, their
[1:23:32] pains, and all this different stuff. But
[1:23:34] listen, hallelujah. What he told Moses
[1:23:36] to go tell Pharaoh. He said, "Hey, I've
[1:23:39] heard the cry of my people.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY GO INTO
[1:23:45] THE WILDERNESS AND DO WHAT?"
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; WORSHIP.
[1:23:48] WORSHIP.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; I'MMA SAY IT AGAIN. I GUARANTEE YOU WAS
[1:23:53] NO PIANO THERE.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; IT WAS ABOUT OFFERING UP A LIFE.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; GOD SET THEM FREE SO THAT THEY COULD GO
[1:24:05] INTO THE WILDERNESS AND GIVE BACK A LIFE
[1:24:08] TO HIM. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY GOD SENT
[1:24:11] THE MESSAGE TO US. SET US FREE. WHY? SO
[1:24:14] THAT WE COULD WORSHIP HIM. CUZ WE WERE
[1:24:16] DOING IT IN PART IN OUR DENOMINATIONS.
[1:24:19] BUT THEN HE CAME AND SET US FREE SO WE
[1:24:21] COULD WHOLLY worship him.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said my people go there
[1:24:27] they may worship me. So they went in the
[1:24:29] wilderness and they started to
[1:24:30] worshiping. Hallelujah.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; But then as it went along you know
[1:24:35] different instruments got involved in
[1:24:36] different things and that's when people
[1:24:37] started to settle in. Right.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Worship originally was about a life,
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; sacrifice of life. BUT THEN AS WE
[1:24:47] STARTED ADDING SOUND TO IT, people
[1:24:50] started to take away from the life
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; and they put people on the keyboard and
[1:24:54] different INSTRUMENTS WHOSE LIFE IS NOT
[1:24:56] WORTHY.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE DON'T SEE GOD IN THE
[1:24:59] WORSHIP.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my. BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BRING
[1:25:04] out God.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. AND YOU LOOK CHURCH, LISTEN WHAT
[1:25:09] GOD DID. THE BIBLE SAYS IN GENESIS 22,
[1:25:12] it said that God came to tempt Abraham.
[1:25:14] He said, "Hey, I WANT YOU TO KILL YOUR
[1:25:16] SON." LISTEN TO ABRAHAM'S LANGUAGE.
[1:25:19] ABRAHAM SAY, "I THE LAD GOING TO GO AND
[1:25:21] DO WHAT?" WORSHIP.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; We're going to go WORSHIP AND I LAG
[1:25:28] GOING TO COME BACK TO YOU.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHAT WAS THAT WORSHIP ALL
[1:25:31] ABOUT? THE SACRIFICE OF A LIFE
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SOUND.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I'M ASKING
[1:25:41] YOU, HAVE YOU GIVEN GOD YOUR LIFE
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; IN WORSHIP?
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; So he goes, he gathers up everything. He
[1:25:53] has uh Isaac with him gathering stuff
[1:25:55] up. And now Isaac has to come to a place
[1:25:59] to where he surrenders in worship.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; There we go. That's the biggest thing
[1:26:04] right there, church. A lot of times
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; there are things God want from us, but
[1:26:10] we ain't ready to give it.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Something as simple as just raising your
[1:26:15] hands.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; And we'll put it back on a sound or
[1:26:21] where we at, what church we in or
[1:26:22] whatever church. When God bless
[1:26:25] Hallelujah. It has nothing to do with
[1:26:27] these four walls.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; What is HE BLESSING? HE'S BLESSING THE
[1:26:31] LIFE.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW THE QUESTION IS, are you
[1:26:36] blessed?
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; About 10 of you.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So you look, he says, "HEY, YOU
[1:26:47] GO WOR. Go kill your son. I want you to
[1:26:49] GO WORSHIP." YOUR WORSHIP HAS TO BE FOR
[1:26:52] REAL
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU CAN'T FAKE GOD OUT. YOU CAN'T
[1:26:56] IMITATE SOMEBODY ELSE. IT HAS TO BE
[1:26:58] SOMETHING PERSONAL.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT CAN'T BE SOMETHING YOU
[1:27:01] SAW SOMEBODY ELSE DO. IT HAS TO BE A
[1:27:03] REVELATION.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; AND YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO DIE.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BE WILLING TO DIE FOR WHAT'S
[1:27:10] BEEN REVEALED TO YOU.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; AND NOW HE HAS ISAAC LAID DOWN. AT
[1:27:15] FIRST, ISAAC HAD TO SURRENDER. THINK
[1:27:17] ABOUT OUR KIDS TODAY. SAY, "MAN, I ain't
[1:27:18] dying for you." Right. Come on.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; That's your revelation. [laughter]
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; That's your revelation. I ain't dying
[1:27:27] for you.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Well, look, Isaac was willing TO LAY HIS
[1:27:31] LIFE DOWN AND DO WHAT? BECOME A
[1:27:35] SACRIFICE OF PRAISE.
[1:27:38] [screaming]
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; He was GOING TO BE A SACRIFICE OF PRAISE
[1:27:43] UNTO HIS FATHER.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO, he laid his life down.
[1:27:48] And you know what? Hallelujah. ABRAHAM
[1:27:52] COULDN'T MIMIC WHAT HE SAW SOMEBODY ELSE
[1:27:53] DO. He literally had to go through it.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; He literally had to become one with the
[1:27:59] worship.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; And as he put his hand up to break it
[1:28:02] down, an angel came and said, "Stand out
[1:28:04] your hand. I KNOW THAT YOUR worship is
[1:28:06] for real."
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT IS IT DOING? IT'S BRINGING
[1:28:10] ME BACK TO THE SAME GRACE THAT GOD GAVE
[1:28:12] WHEN HE LAID HIS LIFE DOWN. AMEN.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:19] YOUR WORSHIP SHOULD ALWAYS BRING US BACK
[1:28:22] TO THE EXPRESSION OF Christ
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; again. David David starts to worship. He
[1:28:31] starts to dance and his wife is looking
[1:28:33] at him say, "Look at the king dancing
[1:28:35] out his clothes."
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; You know what? If I was there,
[1:28:41] me and David would have been twins.
[1:28:44] Amen.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm not just a follower.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; If God is revealing something, I want to
[1:28:52] be a part of it.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND THE REASON WHY DAVID
[1:28:56] DANCED is because he saw the ark.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; HE SAW THE ARK ON ITS WAY BACK.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; AND BY REVELATION, HE KNEW ONCE THAT ARK
[1:29:05] WAS RESTORED, THEY'D BE UNSTOPPABLE
[1:29:08] AGAIN.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT THE ENEMY WOULD NEVER
[1:29:12] BE A MATCH FOR THE CAMP AGAIN. WHY?
[1:29:15] Because the word was restored.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; AND DAVID, HALLELUJAH, IT WASN'T, AMEN.
[1:29:20] JUST A BIG MEETING. IT WAS AN ORDINARY
[1:29:23] WEDNESDAY NIGHT SERVICE.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; And he SAW A WORD ON ITS WAY BACK. IT
[1:29:29] WASN'T EVEN RESTORED YET. JUST THE
[1:29:32] REVELATION OF KNOWING WHAT CAN HAPPEN
[1:29:34] ONCE IT'S PUT BACK IN PLACE. THINK ABOUT
[1:29:37] THAT, CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. WE HAVEN'T HAD
[1:29:39] A BODY CHANGE YET, BUT JUST THE
[1:29:41] POSSIBILITY OF KNOWING THAT IT'S GOING
[1:29:43] TO HAPPEN
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; IS ENOUGH TO GET ME OUT OF MY SEAT.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; IS ENOUGH TO GET ME TO RAISE MY HAND. IS
[1:29:51] ENOUGH TO BRING TEARS DOWN MY EYES. JUST
[1:29:54] THE THOUGHT OF KNOWING WHAT GOD IS GOING
[1:29:56] TO do
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; is enough for me.
[1:30:00] and David with just the thought of
[1:30:03] knowing
[1:30:04] truth being revealed right there in the
[1:30:07] worship. Hallelujah. That when the word
[1:30:10] is restored, the camp is safe again.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Church, do we believe we have a word
[1:30:18] that makes us safe?
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; H we have a word where the enemy can't
[1:30:25] just bust in our camp.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; We're free to worship.
[1:30:30] OH MY.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE GRACE OF GOD.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; AND THERE SHOULD BE AN EXPRESSION
[1:30:36] TOWARDS GOD. Oh my.
[1:30:40] Everybody. All right.
[1:30:42] [snorts]
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Listen. He said he he's talking about
[1:30:45] Abel. He said it was a revelation that
[1:30:47] Abel had that made him just. He had a
[1:30:50] revelation of the requirements of the
[1:30:52] almighty God. AND HE BROUGHT A LAMB.
[1:30:55] HALLELUJAH. IT WAS THE REVELATION THAT
[1:30:57] HE WAS EXPRESSING BACK TO GOD THROUGH
[1:31:00] worship
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; and THE REVELATION OF KNOWING THAT
[1:31:03] THEY'RE SAFE. DAVID BE TO dance before
[1:31:05] the Lord. See, the Bible DON'T SAY THAT
[1:31:08] HE WAS DANCING before Israel. IT SAY
[1:31:10] THAT HE WAS DANCING BEFORE the Lord.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; SO THE ONLY ONE, HALLELUJAH, THAT HAD TO
[1:31:15] BE PLEASED WITH THE DANCE WAS GOD.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; SO WHY YOU JUDGING ME OR JUDGING
[1:31:21] SOMEBODY ELSE? I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT
[1:31:23] YOU. GOD IS THE ONLY ONE I GOT TO
[1:31:25] PLEASE.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO IF I RAISE MY HAND, IF I
[1:31:29] DON'T RAISE MY HAND, IF I CRY, IF I
[1:31:30] SHOUT, IF I DANCE, LONG AS GOD IS
[1:31:32] PLEASED, I'M ALL RIGHT.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; That's what counts.
[1:31:43] He said, "As David danced before the
[1:31:45] Lord, even in the midst OF HIS CRITICS,
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY CLOSE TO HIS HEART, look at the
[1:31:51] king dancing out his clothes."
[1:31:54] What a shame. What a pity. Poor brother
[1:31:58] Digs, jumping and running again like
[1:32:01] always.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. My worship is the same.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; It ain't something I take off and put
[1:32:09] on.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; It's a real revelation. And what I love
[1:32:13] about David, hallelujah, even though he
[1:32:15] loved his wife, you know what he told
[1:32:17] her? He said, "Hey, you think that was
[1:32:18] something? You wait the Sunday.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; But we going to cut UP IN HERE
[1:32:23] TERRIBLE." HALLELUJAH. WE GOING TO
[1:32:25] REALLY SHAKE it up in here.
[1:32:29] Everybody going to be in here pouring.
[1:32:34] Hallelujah.
[1:32:37] Think about it.
[1:32:39] What happens
[1:32:41] when we all come under the same headship
[1:32:43] of the revelation of worship?
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; What happens? Don't get nervous. I'm
[1:32:48] about to close. I said I'm about to. So,
[1:32:50] I might say that four more times.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Just know that I'm about to.
[1:32:57] Y'all know I say that because those
[1:32:58] words got power.
[1:33:00] It helps bring you back into attention.
[1:33:05] Some of you looking down at the floor. I
[1:33:06] said I'm about to close.
[1:33:10] [applause]
[1:33:14] Some of you drifting.
[1:33:16] I'm about to close. Amen. Praise the
[1:33:19] Lord. That was just wonderful. Brother
[1:33:22] Diggs
[1:33:24] woke me up out of my sleep.
[1:33:27] [laughter]
[1:33:28] So, if you're a little tired, maybe a
[1:33:30] little disinterested, I ain't offended.
[1:33:32] I'm about to close.
[1:33:36] Hallelujah.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Well, church,
[1:33:40] it's about the life being expressed back
[1:33:42] to God.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; AND FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME, it was
[1:33:45] all about the life being expressed back
[1:33:47] to God through the worship.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S US THAT PUT IT ON A SOUND.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALWAYS THE LIFE BEHIND THE PERSON
[1:33:56] PUSHING out the sound.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Again, we go to David. Hallelujah.
[1:34:02] Remember God put a CURSE ON SAUL.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE WAS DISOBEDIENT.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; BUT THEN WHEN DAVID CAME IN HIS
[1:34:10] PRESENCE, WHAT DID DAVID DO? DAVID
[1:34:11] BROUGHT SOME WORSHIP THERE.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND LOOK, DAVID
[1:34:16] STARTED TO PLAY THE HARP.
[1:34:23] And he was so skillful with it.
[1:34:25] Hallelujah. And as he played THE DEMONS
[1:34:28] AROUND, HALLELUJAH. BEGIN to run because
[1:34:31] of the worship. OH,
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OUR WORSHIP CAN DRIVE OUT
[1:34:37] DEMONS
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; IF THE LIFE IS RIGHT.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT THE SOUND. IT'S THE
[1:34:44] [screaming] LIFE BEHIND THE SOUND.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE SOUND IS FOR THE FLESH.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; BUT THE LIFE IS FOR the inward man.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IN TERMS AS DAVID BEGAN TO
[1:34:56] WORSHIP, THAT SPIRIT WOULD LIFT UP OFF
[1:34:59] OF SAUL. DON'T YOU REALIZE
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; normally when Saul saw David, he wanted
[1:35:03] to kill him.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; BUT WHILE DAVID WAS WORSHIPING, THERE
[1:35:07] WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO ABOUT IT.
[1:35:15] See the sound of closing.
[1:35:24] [laughter]
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; I've been preaching for an hour. I'm
[1:35:27] about to close. Maybe about 55 minutes.
[1:35:31] Hallelujah. Something like that.
[1:35:33] But I try to be mindful.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; But look, church, it's always about the
[1:35:40] life. Yes.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; And you look at David. David starts to
[1:35:43] play. And the demon, hallelujah, that
[1:35:46] was on Saul that wanted to take his
[1:35:48] life. They had him all messed up. They
[1:35:50] had him all bitter and jealous. When he
[1:35:53] came into the presence of that worship,
[1:35:55] that spirit would leave.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Now, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.
[1:35:59] THAT SPIRIT CAME FROM GOD.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; BUT THE ANOINTING ON DAVID WAS SO
[1:36:03] STRONG, IT COULD DRIVE OUT A SPIRIT THAT
[1:36:06] GOD PUT THERE.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME LIFE. AMEN.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHERE WAS GOD? HE WAS IN
[1:36:14] DAVID.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID DAVID WAS WHAT? A MAN OUT
[1:36:17] OF GOD'S VERY OWN HEART.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; SO THE WORSHIP THAT DAVID WAS GIVING OUT
[1:36:22] WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME WORSHIP THAT
[1:36:23] GOD WOULD GIVE.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; And as he worshiped, the spirits left.
[1:36:36] Hallelujah. But when he stopped, the
[1:36:38] spirit came back.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; So what was the demon afraid of? It
[1:36:43] wasn't the harp.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; It was the life that was in David.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; And think about this, church. I'm going
[1:36:50] to drop a bomb ON YOU REAL QUICK. ARE
[1:36:52] YOU READY?
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT THIS. DAVID DIDN'T HAVE THE
[1:36:55] HOLY GHOST.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS SO ANOINTED,
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; HE COULD GET IN A PLACE THAT'LL DRIVE
[1:37:03] OUT EVIL SPIRITS.
[1:37:06] AND WE ARE EMPOWERED WITH THE VERY OWN
[1:37:09] LIFE.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; And we sit in here and get sleepy.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Let me
[1:37:22] tie the blood hound back up. Hallelujah.
[1:37:26] But church, as we go on and on and look
[1:37:28] through the scriptures, you can see that
[1:37:30] it was more or less about the life. And
[1:37:32] the life would tell you whether the
[1:37:33] worship is accepted or not. Look church,
[1:37:36] they got that Moses went up on a on a on
[1:37:39] the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights
[1:37:41] and he heard a sound.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; HE HEARD A SOUND DOWN THERE. THEY SAY,
[1:37:45] "OH, THEY WORSHIPING." SAY, "OH, NO,
[1:37:47] THEY CUTTING UP." THAT AIN'T the sound
[1:37:48] of worship down there.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND HE WENT, "WHY? WHY
[1:37:52] WASN'T THE SOUND ACCEPTED?" BECAUSE OF
[1:37:54] THE PEOPLE'S LIFE, THEIR LIFE,
[1:37:56] HALLELUJAH, WAS WAS GIVING ARMS AND
[1:37:58] WORSHIP UNTO AN IDOL GOD. AMEN.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; SO THE VERY SOUND SHOWED THAT IT WASN'T
[1:38:03] RIGHT.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Showed that the life wasn't right.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; IT WAS DOING WHAT? REVEALING A TRUTH.
[1:38:11] AND THAT'S WHAT OUR WORSHIP SHOULD DO.
[1:38:13] IT SHOULD BRING US INTO A TRUTH.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Think about it. I'm
[1:38:20] going to wrap it up.
[1:38:25] As we look through the Bible,
[1:38:27] real worship. All right. If you go to
[1:38:30] second Kings, me and me and Pastor Jason
[1:38:33] was sitting in the back and I can't I
[1:38:35] can't think of the He had a very first
[1:38:38] song Tony open up with
[1:38:40] You made a way when my back was against
[1:38:44] the wall
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; and I thought that it was over.
[1:38:49] He was singing that song. Y'all know
[1:38:51] what I was playing coming down the road?
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; That very same song.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says in Chronicles 25
[1:38:58] that the worship is supposed to prophesy
[1:39:00] the battle.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; SO HALLELUJAH TONY NOT JUST BEING A SONG
[1:39:07] LEADER BUT CATCHING THE INSPIRATION OF
[1:39:09] SERVICE
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; through worship. HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT GOD DID WHAT? MADE A
[1:39:15] WAY.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; OH MY. THE VERY THING THAT WAS ON MY
[1:39:21] HEART CATCHING IT IN WORSHIP. SO CHURCH,
[1:39:24] IF HE CAUGHT it and it was the very
[1:39:26] thing that I was, HALLELUJAH, DEALING
[1:39:28] WITH BEFORE I CAME THROUGH THE PULL PIT,
[1:39:30] WHAT IS THE MESSAGE? THE MESSAGE IS THAT
[1:39:32] GOD MADE A WAY
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; TONIGHT.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU THOUGHT THAT IT WAS OVER, GOD
[1:39:38] MADE A WAY. PROPHESIED IN SONG, THE
[1:39:41] WINNING OF THE BATTLE.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:39:44] WE NOT JUST SINGING SONGS. WE'RE
[1:39:46] STEPPING INTO THE FUTURE WITH OUR
[1:39:48] WORSHIP.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:53] So you think about that when you come to
[1:39:55] church.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to dictate the battle.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; That's why I sing songs of victory.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Nobody greater.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Nobody greater than you.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My God is greater.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; My God is stronger. God, you are higher
[1:40:20] than any other. Now you tell me, what is
[1:40:25] God gonna do when you giving him that
[1:40:26] kind of worship?
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK HE GONNA SIT BACK AND SAY,
[1:40:29] "I'm not greater.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not stronger.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not healer. I'm not awesome in
[1:40:35] power.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; YOU START TO LIFT HIM UP LIKE THAT, IT
[1:40:38] BRINGS GOD AT ATTENTION.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; GOD IS SAYING, "THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE
[1:40:42] SAYING ABOUT ME." SO, I HAVE TO MEET
[1:40:44] THAT EXPECTATION.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING, WE'RE CALLING
[1:40:49] OUT HIS LIFE.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Worship church. The
[1:40:58] next time you get to church and you
[1:41:00] start to worship, remember I ain't
[1:41:02] talking about the sound.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Talking about the life.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; What are we giving unto God?
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; I'mma close back with that testimony.
[1:41:11] church.
[1:41:13] You ever came to church and had a
[1:41:14] headache
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; and then start to give God praise and a
[1:41:18] headache lifted?
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; What is that? That's the spirit.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "Worship in spirit and in
[1:41:25] truth."
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "This is the hour
[1:41:29] that we're going to do it. We're going
[1:41:31] to worship in spirit and in truth."
[1:41:33] YEAH. WE'LL SAY ALL DAY LONG, "WE GOT
[1:41:35] TRUTH." RIGHT.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; But we got spirit.
[1:41:40] Lazy spirit.
[1:41:44] [laughter]
[1:41:46] Not tonight, God. I just worked 10
[1:41:49] hours.
[1:41:51] Come on, brother D. 45 minutes. You know
[1:41:53] the prophet said 45 minutes, brother
[1:41:58] dictating the worship.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Church, when I was a young guy, I was so
[1:42:02] bad. I used to set like like my phone, I
[1:42:03] used to set my watch the one time I
[1:42:06] thought the preacher ought to stop.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; If you're guilty of that, let me tell
[1:42:12] you something. We preachers, we don't
[1:42:15] care.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Your law can be your law can be as loud
[1:42:23] as a tutu train.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; We hear it and we ignore it.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Keep on preaching
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; because you can't dictate the worship.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; It's liberty. It's freedom. Hallelujah.
[1:42:38] Amen. And it's about God having total
[1:42:41] preeminence. We look all through the
[1:42:43] scriptures, it was about God having
[1:42:44] preeminence in the life of the believer.
[1:42:47] THAT'S REAL WORSHIP.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; REAL WORSHIP IS GOD HALLELUJAH BEING ON
[1:42:52] DISPLAY through the life of the
[1:42:53] believer.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; That's real worship. And that has
[1:42:55] nothing to do with a sound.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Come, come, musicians, y'all come.
[1:43:01] But there is truth
[1:43:03] revealed in worship.
[1:43:06] Just like it was with Cain and Abel.
[1:43:09] Just like it was with Abraham. Just like
[1:43:11] it was with with with Moses them. But
[1:43:15] look, the Bible says that they sung the
[1:43:17] song OF MOSES. THEY SUNG WHAT? A NEW
[1:43:20] SONG.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT CATCH US. YOU KNOW
[1:43:22] THAT'S A NEW SONG. OH, I don't know that
[1:43:24] song. I can't sing that. That's
[1:43:26] something new.
[1:43:28] When the BIBLE SAYS WHEN THEY GOT THE
[1:43:30] VICTORY, THEY SUNG A NEW SONG. AND THE
[1:43:33] PROPHET OF GOD SAY THE REASON WHY SOME
[1:43:35] OF US DON'T WORSHIP IS BECAUSE WE AIN'T
[1:43:37] GOT ENOUGH VICTORY IN OUR LIVES.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; He said he was criticizing and next
[1:43:44] thing you know his Methodist foot got
[1:43:45] the patent.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; He said next thing you know he was out
[1:43:49] on the floor dancing with that very girl
[1:43:51] he was criticizing.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God brought him up into the
[1:43:55] revelation.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Before you criticize something, try to
[1:43:59] catch the inspiration of it.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep in mind,
[1:44:05] I'm not saying that my expression is
[1:44:07] right and your expression is wrong.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; What I'm saying is no matter how we
[1:44:13] express it, it should show Christ.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Think about think about the sister who
[1:44:19] only had a little bit of meal and a
[1:44:21] little bit of oil.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; And the prophet came down there, he
[1:44:24] said, "Bake me a cake." Now, that was a
[1:44:27] special request.
[1:44:29] But even you think about the prophet,
[1:44:31] the prophet God told him, he said, "Go
[1:44:32] down there as a woman to sustain me."
[1:44:35] And when he get DOWN THERE, SHE AIN'T
[1:44:37] GOT ENOUGH for
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; she ain't got ENOUGH FOR HIM NOR THEM.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; BUT HE HAD TO TRUST GOD. H SEE, THAT'S
[1:44:44] REAL WORSHIP.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; REAL WORSHIP IS BEING ABLE TO TRUST GOD
[1:44:48] IN THE MIDST OF ADVERSITY.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; SO HE SAYS, "BAKE ME A CAKE FIRST." And
[1:44:54] she says, "ALL I GOT IS JUST ENOUGH FOR
[1:44:56] ME AND MY SON AND WE GOING to bake and
[1:44:57] I'mma die." He said, "No, BAKE ME ONE
[1:44:59] FIRST." SO, SHE WAS OBEDIENT. What was
[1:45:01] she doing? She was worshiping by
[1:45:03] revelation,
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; baking the cake, putting it together.
[1:45:07] Hallelujah. And in her mind, she had to
[1:45:09] think, hallelujah, what's going to
[1:45:11] happen after this. But that didn't stop
[1:45:12] her from worshiping. Sometimes you got
[1:45:15] to push through. Hallelujah. Don't let
[1:45:17] your imagination run wild. Push through.
[1:45:19] Hallelujah. Bring those thoughts under
[1:45:21] suggestion. Hallelujah. In her worship,
[1:45:23] she worshiped and hallelujah. [music]
[1:45:25] She baked the cake. She gave it to him.
[1:45:27] Hallelujah. AND THE PROPHET BLESSED IT.
[1:45:29] HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:31] And from that point, she was never
[1:45:33] hungry again.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Now, you think about her anytime
[1:45:38] something came up about God being a
[1:45:40] provider.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; I GUARANTEE YOU, SHE couldn't contain
[1:45:44] her worship.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; And she may not have been jumping or or
[1:45:48] OR FLYING. SHE MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN
[1:45:50] sitting at tears coming down her eyes
[1:45:52] cuz she's thinking about the goodness of
[1:45:54] God.
[1:45:56] bring her back to the life of the lamb.
[1:46:00] That's what it's supposed to do.
[1:46:03] So you examine yourself by the way you
[1:46:06] worship.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Ah the greatest mystery is receiving the
[1:46:13] Holy Ghost without sensation.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know the problem say we can't
[1:46:20] make God some old doy grandfather.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's probably one of the
[1:46:26] greatest mysteries. But if you finish up
[1:46:29] what he was saying, he said, "But
[1:46:30] receiving a person."
[1:46:32] [laughter]
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Receiving Christ Jesus.
[1:46:36] HALLELUJAH. AND IF YOU RECEIVE A PERSON,
[1:46:38] EVERY PERSON HAS SOME KIND OF
[1:46:40] EXPRESSION. [music]
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; And if you don't have some kind of
[1:46:43] expression, that mean you dead.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; So be real with it. Amen.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about who's around, who's
[1:46:52] watching. Be real with it. Ask yourself,
[1:46:53] am I a worshshiper?
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Church don't mean nothing [music] if God
[1:46:58] is not pleased with our worship.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Because that's the ONLY WAY THE FIRE IS
[1:47:03] GOING TO COME DOWN UPON THE ALTAR is if
[1:47:05] God is pleased. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:47:08] Offering that life, [music] OFFERING
[1:47:10] THAT SACRIFICE. THERE HAD TO BE
[1:47:11] something without blemish. Hallelujah.
[1:47:13] Something that [music] DIDN'T HAVE ANY
[1:47:14] FLAWS. IT HAD TO BE SOMETHING WORTHY OF
[1:47:17] GOD COMING DOWN. Ask yourself, did you
[1:47:20] give God that tonight? DID YOU GIVE GOD
[1:47:22] SOMETHING WORTHY OF COMING DOWN [music]
[1:47:24] upon your altar?
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Not the next man, you.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Me.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Did we give God what he deserves?
[1:47:35] Let's pray.
[1:47:38] Lord, we love you tonight. We appreciate
[1:47:40] you, Lord.
[1:47:42] Lord, and we pray something was said to
[1:47:45] Lord, help your people, Lord. Not my
[1:47:48] thoughts or my ways or my actions,
[1:47:51] but Lord, you deserve
[1:47:54] the very life given given back to you,
[1:47:56] [music] Lord.
[1:47:58] Lord, and we want to be like the magi,
[1:48:00] Lord. We want to prophesy the life of
[1:48:03] Christ through worship, Lord. Lord, when
[1:48:05] they came, they gave, they saw your star
[1:48:08] and they follow it. They they say,
[1:48:09] "We've come to worship him." And when
[1:48:11] they came, they came with gifts. They
[1:48:14] came with frankincense, deity, and myrr,
[1:48:18] WHICH MEANT, HALLELUJAH, WITH GOLD. IT
[1:48:20] MEANT deity and service to die. THEIR
[1:48:23] WORSHIP PROPHESIED THE LIFE OF CHRIST.
[1:48:26] [music] And Lord, let our worship step
[1:48:28] into the realms of your next step in our
[1:48:31] lives.
[1:48:32] Lord, we don't want to just be [music]
[1:48:34] bystanders. We don't want to just be
[1:48:36] church members, but we want to be what
[1:48:38] we were created for, and that was to
[1:48:40] worship. [music]
[1:48:42] Not out of duty,
[1:48:45] but out of thankfulness.
[1:48:49] Lord, because we're the redeemed of the
[1:48:50] Lord. We got a song that the angels
[1:48:52] can't sing.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, continue to set us free. Set us
[1:48:59] free from our own consciousness. Set us
[1:49:02] free from our own culture, Lord. Set us
[1:49:05] free from the thoughts of imagination
[1:49:07] and let us give back to you that very
[1:49:10] liberty that you've given to us.
[1:49:13] Lord, we love you. We appreciate you. In
[1:49:15] the name of Jesus Christ, somebody say,
[1:49:17] "Amen.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Sing it together now.
[1:49:37] I'm coming [music] back to the heart
[1:49:41] [singing] of worship
[1:49:44] and it's [music] all about you.
[1:49:48] It's all [singing] about you, Jesus.
[1:49:52] I'm sorry, [music] Lord, for the thing I
[1:49:56] [singing]
[1:49:57] made it. When it's [music] all about
[1:50:00] you,
[1:50:02] it's all about you. I'm coming back. I'm
[1:50:07] coming [music] back to the heart of
[1:50:11] [singing] worship.
[1:50:13] And it's [music] all about
[1:50:18] worship him now. Raise your hands to the
[1:50:20] Lord now.
[1:50:21] I'm sorry, [music] Lord, for the thing
[1:50:25] [singing] I made it. [music] When it's
[1:50:28] all about you.
[1:50:32] It's all [music] about you, Jesus.
[1:50:37] [snorts] When the music fades
[1:50:39] [music and singing]
[1:50:41] and all is stripped away
[1:50:44] and I simply come, [singing]
[1:50:49] longing just
[1:50:51] longing just [music] to bring something,
[1:50:56] something that's of worth that will
[1:50:59] bless your heart. [music and singing]
[1:51:05] I'll bring you more than a song. [music]
[1:51:10] For a song in itself, it's not what you
[1:51:14] have required.
[1:51:18] [music]
[1:51:20] You search much deeper within.
[1:51:24] And through the way things
[1:51:25] [singing and music]
[1:51:26] appear, you're looking into my heart.
[1:51:31] [singing] Oh. Oh.
[1:51:34] I'm coming [music] back to the heart of
[1:51:38] [singing] worship.
[1:51:40] And it's [music] all about Let's make it
[1:51:43] all about him. It's all about you,
[1:51:47] Jesus.
[1:51:49] I'm [music] sorry, Lord, for the thing I
[1:51:53] [singing] made it. When it's [music] all
[1:51:56] about Yes, it is, Lord. It's all about
[1:52:00] [singing] Oh,
[1:52:03] I'm coming back to [music] the heart of
[1:52:08] worship
[1:52:09] where it's all about [singing]
[1:52:11] you. Oh, it's all [music] about Yes, it
[1:52:15] is, Lord. Oh, I'm sorry, [singing] Lord,
[1:52:19] for the thing I [music] made it. When
[1:52:24] it's all about you. [singing]
[1:52:26] Lord, it's all [music] about you. Tell
[1:52:30] him this now. King of
[1:52:33] king of endless word,
[1:52:36] no one could express
[1:52:40] how much you deserve.
[1:52:44] This is [music] true. Though I'm weak,
[1:52:47] though I'm weak and poor, [music]
[1:52:51] all I have is yours.
[1:52:54] Every single [music]
[1:52:56] breath
[1:52:58] I'll bring you more. I'll bring you
[1:53:01] [music] more than a song. [singing]
[1:53:05] For a song in itself is not [music] what
[1:53:09] you have required. [singing]
[1:53:14] Lord, you search much deeper within.
[1:53:17] [music]
[1:53:18] Oh, [singing]
[1:53:19] by the way things appear. You're looking
[1:53:23] into my heart.
[1:53:27] [singing and music] Oh,
[1:53:29] I'm coming back to the heart of
[1:53:33] [singing]
[1:53:34] worship
[1:53:35] and it's all about [music] you. Tell him
[1:53:38] that. Oh, it's all about you.
[1:53:42] I'm sorry. I'm [music and singing]
[1:53:44] sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it.
[1:53:49] When it's [music] all about you. Oh,
[1:53:53] [singing]
[1:53:53] it's all about one more time. Now, I'm
[1:53:58] [music] coming back to the heart of
[1:54:02] [singing] worship
[1:54:04] where it's all [music] about you.
[1:54:08] It's all about [singing]
[1:54:09] you, Jesus. [music]
[1:54:12] And I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I
[1:54:16] [singing] made it when it's all [music]
[1:54:19] about you.
[1:54:22] It's all about you. Can you sing [music]
[1:54:25] this now? It's all It's all about you.
[1:54:31] It's all about you.
[1:54:34] It's all about [singing] you.
[1:54:38] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:54:42] [singing]
[1:54:43] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise.
[1:54:46] [applause and music]
[1:54:50] Amen. Could you come and gather? Could
[1:54:51] you come and gather quickly? We're going
[1:54:53] to gather just up here close to the
[1:54:55] altar and just pray. Take up these needs
[1:54:57] that we [music] have. Amen. Some of them
[1:54:59] that were sent in. Amen. Did you
[1:55:01] appreciate the word of the Lord? Amen.
[1:55:04] Why don't we just give the Lord Jesus a
[1:55:06] another worship of hand [music] clap of
[1:55:08] praise. Amen. He's worthy. Thank you,
[1:55:11] brother Diggs. Amen.
[1:55:14] Just wonderful. Amen. Worship is not a
[1:55:17] song. It's not music. It's a life as
[1:55:19] Brother [music] Diggs so so well. So put
[1:55:22] it so well. Amen. It's not about a
[1:55:25] style. It's not about a you know a
[1:55:27] method. Amen. It's a life. It's a life
[1:55:30] that's lived. It's a sacrifice. Amen.
[1:55:33] and it's being identified. That's what
[1:55:34] the prophet taught us that uh Abel was
[1:55:36] slain on the same altar that his lamb
[1:55:38] was slain upon. Brother Brandham said
[1:55:39] that when you apply the token, he said,
[1:55:41] "You don't come up here. You're coming
[1:55:43] for the life of Christ. You don't come
[1:55:44] up here beating [music] your buddy on
[1:55:45] the back and all laughing good old
[1:55:47] buddy." He said, "You come soberly."
[1:55:50] Amen. You're there to die. Die to
[1:55:51] yourself. Amen. That's true worship. The
[1:55:54] Bible says, "Present your bodies as a
[1:55:56] living sacrifice." Amen. Which is your
[1:55:59] reasonable service. So your reasonable
[1:56:02] service is just to give this part of
[1:56:03] you. Amen. If this if we can't give this
[1:56:06] part, how [music] how could we give our
[1:56:07] heart to the Lord? Amen. We we want to
[1:56:09] say Lord take all of me. How many want
[1:56:11] to say that? Lord take all of me. Amen.
[1:56:13] I don't want to you know [music] some
[1:56:15] people worship as brother Dicks said so
[1:56:17] well and you know express it. So we we
[1:56:20] all uh you know are made up differently.
[1:56:22] Some cry, some shout, some dance, some
[1:56:24] jump. You know, just make sure that
[1:56:27] you're being who God made you be and
[1:56:29] then you give that back to the Lord.
[1:56:31] Amen. I like how brother Dick said,
[1:56:33] there won't be no introverts in heaven.
[1:56:34] Does doesn't mean that introverts won't
[1:56:36] go to heaven. It just means that when
[1:56:38] you get there, you will no longer be an
[1:56:39] introvert. You won't be shy about giving
[1:56:42] your praise to the Lord. Amen. Praise
[1:56:45] God. We have um some prayer requests we
[1:56:48] want to look at. I think Sister Deborah
[1:56:50] just texted. I want to put this prayer
[1:56:52] request in
[1:56:54] uh for sister Deborah Jackson. I heard
[1:56:56] their whole Jackson family is not here
[1:56:58] tonight. Brother Travis texted me and
[1:56:59] said the whole family is sick. Uh so we
[1:57:02] want to keep them in prayer. Uh she just
[1:57:04] wrote in said please [music] pray for
[1:57:06] Miles as he is still not 100% yet. Also
[1:57:09] for Elijah who is not [music] feeling
[1:57:11] well either. Um some needs also that
[1:57:14] were written in from Sister Hope Quick.
[1:57:15] Please pray for Joanne's sister Carolyn
[1:57:18] Kefir, Carol Kefir. She is a believer in
[1:57:21] Three Rivers, [music] California with
[1:57:23] stage 4 pancreatic cancer. She has
[1:57:26] chosen not to have treatments and is
[1:57:27] painfully suffering when the morphine
[1:57:29] wears off. Pray that the Lord speaks to
[1:57:32] her heart and [music] answer some
[1:57:34] spiritual questions for her and that as
[1:57:36] he eases her physical suffering through
[1:57:38] this and that [music] he eases her
[1:57:39] physical suffering through this testing
[1:57:42] time, she knows that the Lord will
[1:57:44] either [music] heal her or take her. She
[1:57:46] is content with his will in the matter.
[1:57:50] Amen. We [music] just want to remember
[1:57:51] that. Carol Kefir. Amen. Believer there.
[1:57:54] So, we just have those two needs only
[1:57:56] once we're that were written in. Amen.
[1:57:58] Maybe you would have something upon your
[1:58:00] heart. You just want to raise a hand.
[1:58:02] Why don't you do that now? [music] Just
[1:58:03] hold that hand up. Identify. We're going
[1:58:04] to have Brother Digs pray for these
[1:58:06] requests. Hold that hand up. Say, "Lord,
[1:58:08] here's my need. Something I have, Amen,
[1:58:10] in my life, something I'm praying
[1:58:12] about." Prayer changes things. [music]
[1:58:13] So, that's what Wednesday night prayer
[1:58:15] meeting is about. We preach and hear the
[1:58:18] ministering of your word, but now we're
[1:58:19] [music] going to pray and talk to the
[1:58:20] Lord. Brother Diggs, would you come and
[1:58:22] take up the need for the Jackson family
[1:58:24] and also these uh hands that are raised
[1:58:27] up here?
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[1:58:38] Lord Jesus, Father, we
[1:58:40] put you before every situation tonight,
[1:58:43] Lord. Lord, you're our healer. You're
[1:58:46] our deliverer, Lord. You're our peace.
[1:58:48] You're our comfort, Lord. And whatever
[1:58:50] the need is tonight, Lord, we know that
[1:58:52] you are more than able. And Lord, we are
[1:58:57] not going to give you thanks based upon
[1:58:59] the results. We're going to give you
[1:59:00] thanks because we know you are God.
[1:59:03] And Lord, and in asking, we know we will
[1:59:06] receive. Lord, in seeking we know we'll
[1:59:08] find, Lord, as we knock, the door shall
[1:59:10] be open, Lord. And Lord, there
[1:59:12] situations of sickness, Lord, of cancer
[1:59:15] and different themes, Lord, that have
[1:59:17] come forth through the prayer line
[1:59:18] tonight. And Lord God, we we touch and
[1:59:22] agree, Father. We get on the same
[1:59:24] accord, applying that one true life of
[1:59:27] Christ to every situation, Lord. You see
[1:59:30] the hands that are lifted. You see the
[1:59:32] needs that here Lord most of all you see
[1:59:35] our hearts Lord and Lord [music] we
[1:59:37] welcome you to sit upon the throne of
