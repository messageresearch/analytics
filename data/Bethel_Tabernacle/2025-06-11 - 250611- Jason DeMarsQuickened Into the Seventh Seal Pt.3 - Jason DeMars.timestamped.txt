[28:52] It truly is amazing grace.
[28:55] Amen. Praise the Lord. It's uh always an
[28:59] honor and a priv privilege to be here.
[29:01] And uh uh even when you get called in
[29:04] the last minute to
[29:07] come come and preach, I I was telling my
[29:10] family I some somehow it feels like you
[29:12] get to cram all the stress of an entire
[29:15] day that you're usually preparing into
[29:18] just a few hours. So uh if I'm a little
[29:21] nervous, pray for me. But I'd be more
[29:24] nervous if I didn't have anything
[29:25] prepared and I just had to come that.
[29:28] So, we're just in the middle of a a
[29:30] series now and continuing on quickened
[29:33] into the seventh seal. This will be part
[29:35] three. And uh the uh the back monitor
[29:39] was blinking and going crazy. Still is
[29:43] off and on. So, not sure what's
[29:45] happening with that, but there's going
[29:46] to be a PowerPoint tonight. I I hope you
[29:48] have that and can pull that up. We want
[29:51] to go to the scripture to start into
[29:54] Romans chapter 8
[29:57] and verse 28.
[30:01] If we're having technical difficulties,
[30:04] it's a great reason to bring a Bible
[30:06] with you to church.
[30:11] Amen.
[30:13] Romans 8:28 through30.
[30:17] And we know that all things work
[30:18] together for good to them that love God.
[30:21] Amen.
[30:22] To them who are the called according to
[30:24] his purpose. For whom he did forno, he
[30:27] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[30:29] the image of his son, that he might be
[30:32] the firstborn among many brethren.
[30:35] Moreover, whom he did predestinate them,
[30:38] he also called. And whom he called them,
[30:41] he also justified. and whom he justified
[30:45] them, he also glorified. Let's pray.
[30:48] Heavenly Father, we just come before you
[30:50] now, Lord, and we ask that your presence
[30:53] would be with us, Lord. Help help us to
[30:55] just step out of the way, Lord. That
[30:58] your Holy Spirit would come and take
[31:00] your word, Lord, and make it alive in
[31:03] our hearts, Lord. That we would we would
[31:06] become this word that's being pre
[31:08] preached. that we would truly take the
[31:10] book and eat that book, Lord, and then
[31:13] prophesy again. Take the words that have
[31:16] been revealed, Lord, and may they become
[31:19] the words that we speak out of out of
[31:22] these mortal lips, Lord. We thank you,
[31:24] Lord. We we know we're living in an hour
[31:27] where it's critical that we know who we
[31:29] are. Amen.
[31:30] Lord, once the the the true bride of
[31:33] Christ has the true revelation of the
[31:36] true church, what and what that means,
[31:39] we know that we'll do the greater works.
[31:42] Lord,
[31:43] we pray that you'd just reveal that to
[31:46] us, Lord, that the that the things of
[31:49] this life that we look at at as
[31:53] hindrances to knowing who we are, that
[31:55] we would really see that actually there
[31:58] are things that are coming across our
[32:00] way so that we would truly reveal who we
[32:03] are in Christ. We thank you for these
[32:06] things, Lord. We thank you for this time
[32:09] tonight. We pray you'd be glorified in
[32:11] our midst. we ask in Jesus' name. Amen.
[32:14] God bless you.
[32:18] All right.
[32:21] It's working. Praise the Lord.
[32:25] This is something that it's been on my
[32:27] mind off and on and I've been
[32:30] looking at this
[32:32] uh word in the scripture and uh seeing
[32:36] it brought me back to this statement
[32:38] that brother Bannon made in the second
[32:40] seal. He says, "People thinks that
[32:42] election is something that's just been
[32:44] something that's juched up here lately.
[32:47] My that's one of the oldest teachings
[32:49] that we have, election and calling." And
[32:53] so, Irenaeus certainly the real students
[32:55] of the scripture always believed in
[32:58] election.
[32:58] Amen. And I thought of that and you know
[33:02] I I
[33:04] I've never preached a message on calling
[33:07] and I've never I don't know that I've
[33:09] ever
[33:11] heard a message preached about calling.
[33:14] And of course I'm not going to be
[33:15] preaching tonight on calling, although
[33:18] that's part of it tonight. Someday I
[33:21] want to go in detail on it. But it
[33:24] really struck me as I looked this and
[33:26] began to run it back
[33:28] into the scriptures and see how many
[33:30] times the term the term called or
[33:34] calling is used in the New Testament
[33:40] and some someday go ahead and do that.
[33:42] Take a look and and do a search and find
[33:45] it. It's the word uh uh cletos
[33:50] and it means invited. uh that is
[33:53] appointed.
[33:54] All right.
[33:55] And so when we look at this word we're
[33:59] speaking we're speaking when when when
[34:01] we can think of another scripture is
[34:05] make your calling and election sure.
[34:08] Amen.
[34:08] So calling is distinct from election
[34:11] right and brother Bham makes that point.
[34:14] Election looks to looks back to our
[34:17] origin right. So, what does calling look
[34:20] to?
[34:22] Well, I think think about some of the
[34:25] other scriptures where where you you
[34:27] read, you see, we're called to be
[34:30] saints. We just read a scripture. It it
[34:33] almost even seems like Paul is using it
[34:36] as a title for believers. He says, "Who
[34:40] are the called according to his purpose,
[34:43] not just called, but you are the
[34:46] called."
[34:46] Amen.
[34:48] you received a calling. Now immediately
[34:51] what many people will bring bring to
[34:53] mind is uh from the scriptures that they
[34:57] say many are called but few are chosen.
[35:03] Absolutely. That's the truth.
[35:06] But that's looking at it from a from a
[35:08] different perspective
[35:10] than this. This means when this when
[35:13] Jesus says many are called but few are
[35:15] chosen means the gospel is preached to
[35:17] all.
[35:20] But we know that the ones that the the
[35:22] ones that respond to the true word
[35:24] that's being preached are the ones that
[35:26] are the chosen.
[35:28] They're chosen. So many res hear the
[35:31] calling to repent, but the only ones
[35:34] that will actually repent are the ones
[35:36] who have been chosen to repent.
[35:40] But as we look at it through the lens of
[35:43] especially through the New Testament,
[35:45] the the the the writings of of Paul and
[35:49] we look at this term the called and we
[35:51] see that this is more not connected
[35:54] necessarily to our origin but actually
[35:56] to what God does to us.
[35:59] Amen.
[36:00] It's even directly connected to that
[36:05] aspect of our salvation that he
[36:08] begins.
[36:10] He who began a good work in you will be
[36:14] faithful to complete it until the day of
[36:16] Jesus Christ. And so because we're the
[36:19] ones that are in invited, it turns into
[36:21] this fact that he says the invited.
[36:24] Why would he say the invited? Think
[36:27] about it. is because all the words of
[36:30] Jesus, no man can come to me unless the
[36:33] father draws him first. What is that
[36:36] drawing? That's the call.
[36:39] The call that he makes to his elect will
[36:42] not be thwarted.
[36:45] Will not be stopped, will not be
[36:47] blocked. He will call them and then he
[36:50] will look at them and say, "These are
[36:52] the called.
[36:54] These are the ones who are called to be
[36:57] saints. And so amazing because he says,
[37:00] "Make your calling and election sure."
[37:04] Well, if God did the calling and God did
[37:07] the electing, how am I going to make it
[37:09] sure?
[37:11] Well, we do it by working out our own
[37:13] salvation with fear and trembling. How
[37:15] do we work out our own salvation with
[37:17] fear and trembling? Well, because it's
[37:20] God working in you both to will and to
[37:22] do of his good pleasure.
[37:24] Right? And so if in other words, God's
[37:28] work in us is effectual.
[37:32] God's work is not weak.
[37:35] It's not limited. When God works in us,
[37:38] it's effect. It has an effect. Same
[37:41] thing with his calling upon us. It has
[37:44] an effect. When he calls, we will
[37:47] answer.
[37:49] Nothing will stop that. Nothing will
[37:51] block that. Yes, we have to make a
[37:54] choice on our human on our on our human
[37:56] end. We make choices. We make decisions.
[37:59] But we're we're understanding this in
[38:01] this hour on a a deeper level. We have
[38:04] to see this on a deeper level to
[38:07] understand God's purpose. If we're just
[38:09] going to preach a gospel that's about
[38:11] choice and our personal choice and our
[38:13] personal decisions, actually, we're not
[38:16] even really preaching the gospel of
[38:17] Jesus Christ.
[38:20] Brother Brandham says, "No man, no man
[38:22] ever seeks God. It's God seeking you."
[38:26] And again, this this calling is God's
[38:30] doing in our life. It's his quickening.
[38:32] It's his transforming power. We're born
[38:34] again
[38:36] not of corruptible seed, but of
[38:38] incorruptible seed by the word of God
[38:41] that lives and abides forever. If we
[38:44] look at it again, we we read this
[38:46] towards the end of the message uh the
[38:48] Sunday before last.
[38:51] But
[38:52] by grace are you saved through faith and
[38:57] that not of yourselves. It is the gift
[38:59] of God, not of works, lest any man
[39:02] should boast. Even our faith is a gift
[39:05] from God. You didn't work yourself up to
[39:07] it. In fact, human faith, many people
[39:10] put human faith in the principles of the
[39:13] word of God. That's not acceptable.
[39:18] You say, "How do you say that?" Because
[39:19] human faith is fickle. Human faith will
[39:22] believe one thing one day and it'll
[39:24] believe another thing another day. But
[39:26] what is it? We are saved by the faith of
[39:31] the son of God.
[39:32] Amen.
[39:33] Right? It's not our own faith. So it's a
[39:36] faith that comes into us by a gift.
[39:39] And again, brother Brandham says in
[39:42] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[39:44] He says, "What is the new birth, brother
[39:45] Brandham?" It's the revelation of Jesus
[39:48] Christ to you personally.
[39:52] And again, you cannot work yourself into
[39:54] a revelation.
[39:56] God gives it by his grace,
[39:58] by his sovereign purpose. He chooses the
[40:02] ones to whom he gives that revelation
[40:05] to. So if you have that revelation
[40:07] living in your heart that it's been
[40:09] quickened to you, you can lift your
[40:10] hands and say,
[40:12] "Amen.
[40:13] The one who started it will be the one
[40:14] who finishes it."
[40:16] This wasn't my choosing. This wasn't my
[40:18] purpose. This wasn't my plan. Mine was
[40:21] quite different.
[40:23] But God has come and he has taken over
[40:26] and he's doing something that's outside
[40:28] of my control. So it is by this
[40:31] revelation that comes to us per per
[40:33] personally that the quickening power
[40:37] enters into us.
[40:38] Amen.
[40:40] But remember again, brother Brandham
[40:42] says you can have the baptism of the
[40:44] Holy Ghost every day of your life and
[40:46] still be lost. The real gift is that
[40:49] seed in there in the soul. That seed
[40:51] gene of God that's in the soul. It's
[40:53] there. It's laying there dormant, right?
[40:56] It needs to be quickened to life.
[40:59] If there's not a seed in there, what
[41:03] would be quickened? There's nothing to
[41:04] be quickened. There must be a seed
[41:07] that's quickened to come to life.
[41:14] Think about God's calling again.
[41:19] No man can come to me unless the father
[41:21] draws him first. I think about
[41:25] Zakius.
[41:27] No doubt when Jesus was passing by,
[41:30] there was many boys that climbed up in
[41:32] the tree. Many people climbed up in the
[41:34] tree to see Jesus coming by. But there
[41:38] was one that Jesus called. He said,
[41:41] "Zakius,
[41:43] make haste."
[41:45] And come down. Amen. And Zakius by that
[41:49] powerful voice could not resist.
[41:53] He came down and and Amen. And not only
[41:56] did he come down, but there was a
[41:58] fellowship to take place in his house.
[42:02] Amen.
[42:04] Jesus Jesus went to his house to speak
[42:07] to him, to deal with him, to work with
[42:09] him.
[42:12] But it came by the call,
[42:14] the call of God. All right.
[42:18] Going to look a little bit at who is
[42:19] this Melkisedc this evening.
[42:23] You remember how we read the scriptures?
[42:24] Not him that willth, or him that runth,
[42:27] but God. And that his predestination
[42:29] might stand true. He could choose before
[42:32] every any time. God is sovereign in his
[42:35] choosing.
[42:37] Did you know that God is sovereign? Who
[42:39] is back there to tell him a better way
[42:41] to make the world? Who would dare to
[42:43] tell him he was running his business
[42:45] wrong? Even the very word itself very
[42:49] sovereign. Even the revelation is
[42:51] sovereign. He reveals to whom he will
[42:54] reveal. The very revelation itself is
[42:56] sovereign in God. That's how people
[42:58] pound at things and jump at things and
[43:00] hit at things not knowing what they're
[43:03] doing, God is sovereign in his work. So
[43:06] you see, even the ones that God reveals
[43:09] the word to, he's chosen them.
[43:12] Amen.
[43:13] They are the ones that he's chosen. It's
[43:15] not just random people.
[43:18] It might look like that to the world. We
[43:20] might look like a bunch of random
[43:22] people, but we were chosen before the
[43:24] foundation of the world. And God had a
[43:26] purpose. And he said, "I'm going to
[43:27] reveal in this age, in this hour, in
[43:29] this time, I'm going to reveal my word
[43:31] to him, to her."
[43:36] Romans 9:11.
[43:40] If you haven't found out yet, Romans 9
[43:42] is one of my favorite uh chapters in the
[43:45] entire Bible.
[43:48] For the children being not yet born,
[43:50] neither having done any good or evil,
[43:53] that the purpose of God according to
[43:55] election might stand, not of works, but
[43:59] of him that calleth. You see there, him
[44:03] that calleth. So who's the one that
[44:05] calls?
[44:06] God calls.
[44:07] Amen.
[44:08] Amen. And that's directly connected to
[44:10] what? His purpose of election.
[44:14] So the ones that God calls are the ones
[44:17] that he has chosen before they've done
[44:20] any good or bad.
[44:23] In fact, if we understand, brother
[44:25] Brandham says everything was all
[44:27] pre-planned by God before the foundation
[44:30] of the world.
[44:31] And then he goes on to say after that
[44:33] that you would be here tonight
[44:36] even to that level. And then he says
[44:38] also how many times a flea flea would
[44:41] bat his eyes.
[44:43] Again, he doesn't just know how many
[44:45] times a flea would bat his eyes. It was
[44:47] all pre-planned
[44:49] before the foundation of the world. How
[44:51] much that particular flea would bat its
[44:53] eyes. So you could see every detail that
[44:57] God is involved with. And it's before
[45:00] the reason why the flea bl bats his eyes
[45:03] is not because the the flea had chosen
[45:06] to bat his eyes. The flea bats his eyes
[45:09] because God before the foundation of the
[45:11] world has pre-planned it.
[45:13] It's his purpose.
[45:16] Romans 9:12, it was said unto her, "The
[45:18] elder shall serve the younger." So in
[45:20] other words, before they did anything
[45:22] good or evil, before they came to be,
[45:26] they the word was spoken to the mother,
[45:31] the elder shall serve the younger. As it
[45:34] is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau
[45:38] have I hated.
[45:41] That's his choosing. He chose one, chose
[45:44] to love one, he chose to hate the other.
[45:48] What shall we say then? Is there
[45:51] unrighteousness with God?
[45:53] I mean, this is getting to the very
[45:55] heart of the matter. Paul is this is the
[45:58] very thing that you talk about
[46:00] predestination
[46:01] at your uh liberal arts Christian school
[46:05] and everyone will say that's not fair.
[46:10] That's not right. How can God hold
[46:12] people accountable if he's chosen? Paul,
[46:15] what's Paul's answer? Well, you see, if
[46:18] you look at Emanuel Kant and take it
[46:21] back to Thomas Aquin, no.
[46:24] What's the answer?
[46:26] God forbid.
[46:29] Or see, he saith to Moses, I will have
[46:31] mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I
[46:33] will have compassion on whom I will have
[46:35] compassion. It It's hitting the
[46:37] philosopher and the doubter and the
[46:40] skeptic right between the eyes.
[46:42] God has said.
[46:44] Why do I believe in pred predestination?
[46:47] Because God has said
[46:49] why do I believe in God's purpose of
[46:52] calling people? Because God has said
[46:56] it was it's not my idea.
[46:59] I would have a different idea.
[47:01] But God's idea, this is scripture. This
[47:04] is what the message of the hour teaches.
[47:07] So we stay with what the word says. He
[47:10] says, "I'll have compassion on whom I
[47:12] will have compassion." Again, mercy is
[47:15] not deserved.
[47:16] I've said this before, but it's it's
[47:19] important to repeat because people get
[47:21] it out get it out of order. It's not
[47:23] fair that God would have mercy on some
[47:26] and leave the others to their just
[47:30] desserts. I'll put it that way.
[47:33] That's right. Mercy isn't fair.
[47:38] Mercy isn't fair. In fact, he if he was
[47:42] fair, all of us would be condemned from
[47:45] start to finish
[47:46] and there would be no one saved.
[47:50] So God has mercy on the ones that he
[47:52] chooses to have mercy. Just like when
[47:55] you look at the Old Testament and he
[47:57] says, "You don't think that I've chosen
[48:00] you because you're greater than all the
[48:03] other nations around you.
[48:06] Why have I chosen you? He repeats again.
[48:08] I've chosen you because I placed my love
[48:11] on you.
[48:13] So I chose you because I chose to love
[48:15] you. That's where it it comes down to.
[48:19] That's his purpose.
[48:23] All right. Continuing from who is this
[48:25] Melkazedc?
[48:27] I missed a few verses.
[48:29] I'm going to black that out and just
[48:32] read them.
[48:34] missed one verse. So then it is not of
[48:36] him that willeth, nor of him that runth,
[48:40] but of God that showeth mercy. Of
[48:43] course, will is speaking of choice. It's
[48:45] speaking of decision. The power of
[48:48] decision. It's not according to your
[48:51] will.
[48:52] It's not according to your choice. Of
[48:54] course, yes, we choose. But the reason
[48:57] that you choose, right?
[49:00] Jesus said, "You have not chosen me, but
[49:03] I have chosen you."
[49:05] Right? And so it's the the the reason
[49:08] you you could say yes is because he has
[49:14] chosen you. The reason that you love him
[49:17] is what? Because he first loved you.
[49:25] Amen. It's God that shows mercy. So God
[49:27] is not his choosing is not based on
[49:30] anything we've done. It's not our choice
[49:33] but rather his sovereign purpose when
[49:36] before the foundation of the world
[49:37] before we did anything.
[49:39] He counseledled with his own self.
[49:43] He chose us in Christ before the
[49:46] foundation of the world based based upon
[49:47] this council. It at that time he placed
[49:50] our names on the lamb's book of life
[49:52] before the foundation of the world.
[49:56] Then as we came to earth, he called us
[49:58] by his sovereign grace and plan,
[50:01] having already justified us in Christ on
[50:05] the cross. It's a finished work. And we
[50:08] received that finished work by faith.
[50:11] Wasn't when you came to the altar. You
[50:13] may have came to the altar. You may have
[50:14] just been in your car like me and said,
[50:16] "Lord, I'm done with this. I want to I
[50:19] want to live for you." And all the
[50:21] burden and the guilt was lifted from my
[50:23] shoulders.
[50:24] It it could have been many different
[50:26] places, but it wasn't because you
[50:30] prayed. It wasn't because you made the
[50:32] decision. You did you did that because
[50:36] he droed you. He called you. He chose
[50:39] you before the foundation of the world.
[50:44] That's not even when you were justified.
[50:47] In fact, if you really understand it,
[50:50] you were justified before the foundation
[50:52] of the world. When the lamb was slain,
[51:03] God even placed his love upon you before
[51:06] the foundation of the world.
[51:09] Brother Brandham so beautifully shows us
[51:12] and helps us to understand you didn't
[51:14] just begin here in your earthly journey
[51:18] now.
[51:19] But you your the life that's inside of
[51:21] you in your soul. That gene was in God
[51:24] before the foundation of the world.
[51:26] It was a part of his life. And so when
[51:30] Christ was chosen before the foundation
[51:32] of the world, you were chosen in him
[51:35] before the foundation of the world. When
[51:36] God set his love upon Christ, he equally
[51:40] set his love upon the elect, the bride
[51:43] that was in him before the foundation of
[51:46] the world.
[51:48] And so
[51:50] when you love something, you don't just
[51:52] love something that doesn't exist. You
[51:55] love something that exists. So God
[51:57] placed his love upon what? His
[52:00] predestinated seed that existed in
[52:03] Christ before the foundation of the
[52:05] world. It's a it's a package. When
[52:08] Christ was chosen, you were chosen. When
[52:11] Christ became the beloved, you became
[52:13] the beloved because you were in him. You
[52:15] were a part of him.
[52:18] That's why these words like redemption
[52:20] and reconciliation are so beautiful and
[52:23] so rich. You say, "Reconciled? I was
[52:25] born an enemy." Yeah, but you didn't
[52:27] start when you were born. You were in
[52:29] him before the foundation of the world.
[52:31] He already loved you. He already set his
[52:34] purpose upon you. When Adam fell, we all
[52:37] fell.
[52:38] And so, he has to bring us back to the
[52:40] original condition where we were in
[52:42] before the foundation of the world.
[52:45] When he loved us and we were holy and
[52:47] perfect and without fault before him.
[52:52] That's redemption. That's
[52:53] reconciliation.
[53:09] Who's is this Melkazedc continuing when
[53:11] Abraham met him he was Melkazedc
[53:14] he unfolds here what all the attributes
[53:18] will do in the final end every son of
[53:22] Abraham every son of the faith will
[53:25] absolutely do the same thing but I I
[53:28] want you to watch how we have to come
[53:31] also. We see him revealed here in Ruth
[53:33] and Boaz as kinsman redeemer. How he had
[53:36] had to come to be flesh. Now we see the
[53:40] attribute sons of his spirit have not
[53:43] yet entered into the word form body but
[53:46] a theophony. The body is subject to the
[53:50] word and earnest waiting for the earnest
[53:55] change of the body.
[53:57] Amen.
[54:00] That's some heavy food that's being
[54:03] spoken there. It's This is in This is
[54:06] incredible.
[54:11] Romans 8
[54:13] 19-23.
[54:15] For the earnest expectation of the
[54:17] creature or the creation waiteth for the
[54:20] manifestation
[54:21] of the sons of God. For the creature was
[54:24] made subject to vanity, not willingly,
[54:27] but by reason of him who has subjected
[54:29] the same in hope, because the creature
[54:32] itself also shall be delivered from the
[54:34] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[54:37] liberty of the children of God.
[54:39] Amen.
[54:40] For we know that the whole creation
[54:42] groanth and travaleth in pain together
[54:45] until now. And not only they, but
[54:48] ourselves also, which have the first
[54:50] fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves
[54:54] grown within ourselves, waiting for the
[54:57] adoption to the redemption of our
[55:01] bodies. And so there is a there is a
[55:04] pattern
[55:06] that every son of Abraham has to come
[55:09] through. And brother Brandham when he's
[55:12] introducing this thought he's he's
[55:14] telling us you and I have to come
[55:18] the same way Melkisedc came. If
[55:22] Melkazedc had to come, we are going to
[55:25] have to come the same way. Now we come a
[55:27] different way.
[55:29] But yet at the same time we come the
[55:31] same way. There's just something that's
[55:32] flipped around
[55:34] and it's showing you and I and brother
[55:37] Brandham immediately goes to the fact
[55:39] that we have a theophony.
[55:42] We're not going to get to the scripture
[55:43] right now. If if I can finish today, I
[55:46] doubt it. Uh 2 Corinthians 5:1, Brother
[55:50] Jason preached on it on Sunday. Uh I
[55:53] think our messages are lining up already
[55:57] without planning.
[56:01] [Laughter]
[56:03] The Lord wants to get something over to
[56:05] us.
[56:07] And so we have we have this process of
[56:10] coming into full manifestation. That's
[56:14] how I would like to express that God has
[56:19] to come into full manifestation.
[56:22] His sons
[56:24] also have to come into full
[56:27] manifestation.
[56:29] Every son of Abraham in even says the
[56:32] attribute sons of his spirit. That's
[56:35] where we are because we're coming we're
[56:37] we're born. We're off of his spirit.
[56:40] We're a part of that life.
[56:44] And so we come in a process. And so
[56:48] we're we become subject what he says
[56:51] subject to the word and earnest waiting
[56:54] for the earnest change of the body. So
[56:58] we haven't yet entered into that word
[57:00] form body right Jesus already went into
[57:04] that word form body right before before
[57:08] the foundation of the world the logos
[57:10] that went out of God the mazdc all the
[57:12] different ways that God met his children
[57:17] in bodily form before the birth of
[57:21] Christ all of those places that was what
[57:25] we call a theophony
[57:27] And you know, we use this term and we're
[57:29] familiar with it. We have songs about
[57:30] it. But the amazing thing when you
[57:32] really think about the word theophony,
[57:34] it means the appearing of God.
[57:37] And so when you it's in bodily form. So
[57:41] you and I also have a theophony.
[57:45] Wow.
[57:47] So you and I also are God appearing in
[57:51] bodily form.
[57:56] What strange doctrine is coming out of
[57:57] Bethl Tabernacle tonight?
[58:00] The scriptural truth because we're a
[58:02] part of his life. No, we are not we are
[58:05] not God himself. We are not the object
[58:08] of worship, but we are sons of that
[58:11] object of worship. And if the word son
[58:15] has any kind of meaning, we understand
[58:17] we're coming from that same life. And
[58:19] God is coming to this place where he
[58:21] wants to be manifested. That's the
[58:24] mistake in understanding the godhead.
[58:27] That's the mistake the early church made
[58:31] when they started to fall away from the
[58:33] original faith. They miss they missed
[58:35] the the the reality of the dynamic
[58:38] revealing of God as he's manifesting
[58:41] himself in time and creation. And they
[58:44] turned into philosophers and they had to
[58:46] understand, oh, what was God before the
[58:48] foundation of the world? And they
[58:50] started to reason out about father, son,
[58:53] and holy spirit and three persons. And
[58:55] they're all co-eternal. And of course,
[58:57] they loved each other before the
[58:59] foundation of the world. And they had a
[59:00] relationship for all of eternity. And
[59:03] the sun, oh, what about the sun? Doesn't
[59:05] sun mean it has beginning? Yeah. Yeah.
[59:07] But it's the eternal son.
[59:10] No scripture for it. It's all
[59:13] sadly a carnal reasoning and using uh
[59:18] the stipulations of Greek philosophy
[59:24] instead of understanding the reality
[59:26] that God is a spirit right and he has he
[59:29] has a life and he wants to express that
[59:31] life. I mean we get to this very per
[59:34] very singular thing is what does it mean
[59:38] that Adam and Eve were made in the image
[59:41] and likeness of God? What does it mean
[59:43] that God breathed into them the breath
[59:46] of life? What are these what are these
[59:49] basic things
[59:51] that as message believers we understand
[59:54] but yet the whole denominational world
[59:56] their mind is blank to it and if you
[59:58] talk about it they shut down and next
[1:00:02] they will shut you out
[1:00:04] say this guy's a Hindu or something
[1:00:09] he believes in some strange
[1:00:12] uh foreign doctrines it's all there
[1:00:15] right in the scriptures it's God
[1:00:17] unfolding himself towards his full
[1:00:20] manifestation,
[1:00:22] which if you understand it, our full
[1:00:23] manifestation is directly connected to
[1:00:26] his full manifestation. Because if we're
[1:00:29] made in the image and likeness of God
[1:00:31] and we're going through a three-fold
[1:00:33] process to get to full manifestation,
[1:00:35] isn't God doing the same thing?
[1:00:38] God is doing the same thing. We're doing
[1:00:40] the same thing. We have to come to that
[1:00:42] place.
[1:00:50] Now the different between him and you as
[1:00:52] a son. See he was at the beginning the
[1:00:54] word an ammorphab body. He came in and
[1:00:57] lived in that in the person of Melzdc.
[1:01:00] Then later we never heard no more of
[1:01:02] Melzdc because he became Jesus Christ.
[1:01:05] Melzdc was the priest but he became
[1:01:07] Jesus Christ. Now you bypassed that
[1:01:10] because in that form he knowed all
[1:01:12] things and you have never been able to
[1:01:15] know that yet. You come like Adam, like
[1:01:18] me. You became from the attribute to the
[1:01:22] flesh to be tempted. But when this life
[1:01:24] is finished here, if this earthly
[1:01:26] tabernacle
[1:01:28] be dissolved, we have one already
[1:01:30] waiting. That's 2 Corinthians 5:1.
[1:01:34] That's where we go. That is the word.
[1:01:35] Then we can look back and see what we've
[1:01:37] done. Now we don't understand it. We've
[1:01:39] never become the word. We've just become
[1:01:41] the flesh man, not the word.
[1:01:44] But and look clearly makes it clear.
[1:01:46] You'll never be the word unless you was
[1:01:49] a thought at the beginning.
[1:01:52] You'll never come into the theophony
[1:01:55] body.
[1:01:56] Or if you don't die, that theophony body
[1:02:00] becomes with one with this body and
[1:02:02] transforms into the glorified body. When
[1:02:05] that happens, you first know that you
[1:02:08] had to be a thought at the beginning.
[1:02:11] And it's great. It'll be it'll be great
[1:02:13] to know that when we have that new body,
[1:02:16] but the reality is you need to know that
[1:02:18] now
[1:02:19] to get to that new body, that revelation
[1:02:22] needs to be made known to you now.
[1:02:25] And he says that proves the
[1:02:27] predestination of God. See, you can't be
[1:02:30] the word unless you're a thought. You
[1:02:32] had to be in the thinking first because
[1:02:36] a word is a thought expressed. But you
[1:02:38] see, in order to stand temptation, you
[1:02:40] had to bypass the theophony. You had to
[1:02:43] come down here in flesh to be tempted by
[1:02:46] sin. And then if you stand, all the
[1:02:49] father hath given me will come to me,
[1:02:52] and I'll raise him up at the last day.
[1:02:54] See, you had to be first. Praise the
[1:02:57] Lord. Do you see that? We have to stand
[1:02:59] temptation.
[1:03:02] My goodness. What What if I What if I
[1:03:04] fail? All that the father has given me
[1:03:06] will come to me and I'll raise him up at
[1:03:08] the last days.
[1:03:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:13] Amen.
[1:03:14] Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:03:16] just uh just a brief thought and and
[1:03:20] we've we've heard it said and we we
[1:03:22] understand there's a false way to look
[1:03:24] at the doctrine of election and and
[1:03:28] people brother Brandon will say they've
[1:03:32] taken grace and turned it into disgrace.
[1:03:35] And
[1:03:37] one of those places that we we look at
[1:03:40] in in the Old Testament
[1:03:42] and it is uh those who say look I'll
[1:03:49] have peace even though I walk after the
[1:03:52] imagination of my own heart. Right? So
[1:03:56] this is a person who believes that he's
[1:03:58] a part of the covenant. He believes and
[1:04:00] he assures himself, I'm I'm okay and I'm
[1:04:04] all right because
[1:04:06] I'm a part of the covenant. I will have
[1:04:08] peace even though I walk after the
[1:04:11] imagination of my own heart.
[1:04:14] So we understand that number one is when
[1:04:18] that revelation comes to you and brings
[1:04:21] forth the new birth, brother Brandham
[1:04:23] always connects that directly to it's
[1:04:27] manifested by the works that you do.
[1:04:30] Right? He he he never disconnects that.
[1:04:33] Take the word into your heart and that's
[1:04:35] Christ and watch it declare itself.
[1:04:38] Um you we all can think of different
[1:04:41] quotes that brother Brandham says and he
[1:04:43] always connects the revelation to that.
[1:04:45] Now we can get confused because he also
[1:04:48] says the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:50] isn't the fruit of the spirit because
[1:04:52] the old Pharisee, the old old priest
[1:04:56] could could go and say, "Hey,
[1:04:59] Jesus, what did he do? Did he visit you
[1:05:02] at your house? Did he help pay your
[1:05:05] debt? He took care of you?
[1:05:07] me, the old Pharisee, your old priest.
[1:05:10] What did he do? He tipped over the money
[1:05:13] changers. He whipped us with cords. Now,
[1:05:16] who's and brother Bram says, "Now, who's
[1:05:17] got the fruit of the spirit?"
[1:05:20] So, it's not the fruit of the spirit.
[1:05:21] Neither is it speaking in tongues that
[1:05:24] can be impersonated.
[1:05:26] But what is it? It's believing the word
[1:05:29] for your hour.
[1:05:31] Or rather, you know, again, you can
[1:05:34] outwardly believe that's not it. Is that
[1:05:37] what I'm talking about? It's the
[1:05:38] revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[1:05:40] personally.
[1:05:46] And so in that
[1:05:49] revelation
[1:05:51] that that will produce a life now
[1:05:54] that'll be different. We're all
[1:05:56] different parts of the body of Christ.
[1:05:58] Different gifts, different purposes,
[1:06:00] different functions.
[1:06:02] And the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:03] sometimes leads you to say one thing to
[1:06:05] one person and another thing to another
[1:06:07] person. Look at the life of Jesus. It's
[1:06:10] it's God's own life is not an exact
[1:06:14] equation.
[1:06:16] God's own life is it's a relationship.
[1:06:20] It's it's his life in you being
[1:06:23] manifested.
[1:06:25] It might rebuke another and comfort
[1:06:27] comfort the other. And you say, "What in
[1:06:29] the world are you doing, Brother
[1:06:29] Brandham?" I mean they they could they
[1:06:32] could say that. Why won't you talk about
[1:06:34] uh birth control, brother Brandham?
[1:06:36] Because I had to talk I have to talk to
[1:06:38] him personally. Why do you have to talk
[1:06:39] to him personally? Well, cuz some of
[1:06:41] them lie to me.
[1:06:45] And so one and Billy Paul even said,
[1:06:48] "Dad, why did you give one answer to one
[1:06:50] person, another answer the other
[1:06:51] person?" Because the one was lying.
[1:06:55] And so that's how critical the
[1:06:58] leadership of the Holy Spirit is. And
[1:07:00] agape love is far different than our
[1:07:02] human affections for family or our or
[1:07:05] our human uh friendship. It's far
[1:07:08] different. And sometimes it will lead
[1:07:11] lead you to comfort someone and
[1:07:13] sometimes it will uh what is the saying
[1:07:16] back there, brother Jason, that a pastor
[1:07:18] needs to do is to comfort the afflicted
[1:07:21] and afflict the comfortable. That's the
[1:07:23] Holy Spirit. And it might not make sense
[1:07:26] to other people, but we need to follow
[1:07:29] the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:30] That's why it can't it it can't be our
[1:07:33] outward manifestations saying this is it
[1:07:37] and that is it. It's the revelation of
[1:07:39] Jesus Christ to you personally.
[1:07:42] And really, I can't tell whether you
[1:07:44] have that or not. I I think I might
[1:07:47] know, but it's to you personally.
[1:07:54] And then you see he come right down the
[1:07:56] regular line from attribute to before
[1:07:59] the foundation of the world his name is
[1:08:00] put on the lamb's book of life. Then
[1:08:02] from that he become the word the
[1:08:04] theophony that could appear disappear
[1:08:07] and then he become flesh and returned
[1:08:10] back again resurrected that same body in
[1:08:14] a glorified condition. But you bypass
[1:08:17] the theophony and become flesh man to be
[1:08:19] tempted by sin. And then if this earthly
[1:08:21] tabernacle is dissolved, we have one
[1:08:24] already waiting. We have not yet
[1:08:28] the bodies.
[1:08:31] But look, when this body receives the
[1:08:33] spirit of God, the immortal life inside
[1:08:36] of you, it throws this body in
[1:08:39] subjection to God.
[1:08:41] Amen.
[1:08:41] Hallelujah. He that's born of God doth
[1:08:44] not commit sin. He cannot sin. In Romans
[1:08:47] 8:1, there is therefore now no
[1:08:48] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:08:50] Jesus. They walk not after the flesh,
[1:08:52] but after the spirit. There you are.
[1:08:54] See, that throws your whole throws your
[1:08:57] body
[1:08:58] subject.
[1:09:00] Amen.
[1:09:02] Amen.
[1:09:04] Romans 8:13.
[1:09:07] For if, here's an if.
[1:09:12] If you live after the flesh, you shall
[1:09:15] die. Right? That which is born of the
[1:09:19] flesh is flesh and will produce the
[1:09:21] works of the flesh. But if
[1:09:26] ye through the spirit do mortify the
[1:09:29] deeds of the body, you shall live.
[1:09:34] Interesting.
[1:09:36] I I would have put it the other way
[1:09:38] around.
[1:09:40] But here he says if if you put to death
[1:09:44] the works of the body you'll live.
[1:09:48] Oh missed a part through the spirit. So
[1:09:51] in other words first you have to have
[1:09:54] the Holy Spirit. First that's the that's
[1:09:56] the first condition that's there right
[1:10:00] and if you have the Holy Spirit what
[1:10:03] will the Holy Spirit do in you?
[1:10:07] kill the deeds of the body.
[1:10:11] Right? So that's what he's try that's
[1:10:13] that's a fruit of the work of God inside
[1:10:16] of you. In other words, what as just as
[1:10:17] brother Benham says, it throws your body
[1:10:20] subject
[1:10:22] to the word. You put the the works of
[1:10:25] the body to death so that then what can
[1:10:28] be manifested is not the works of the
[1:10:31] body but the works of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:34] through you.
[1:10:36] I love we always read this verse
[1:10:39] separated from the verse before that but
[1:10:42] it starts with for which means basically
[1:10:45] because because of this as many as are
[1:10:48] led by the spirit of God they are the
[1:10:50] sons of God. So we c we connect this
[1:10:53] together with this
[1:10:56] this scripture
[1:10:58] through the spirit mortify the deeds of
[1:11:00] the body you'll live
[1:11:04] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:11:06] God they are the sons of God. So it's
[1:11:08] the spirit of God leading us to what to
[1:11:11] put to death the works of the flesh.
[1:11:15] Amen. And it so it throws when that Holy
[1:11:18] Spirit quickens the seed gene of God in
[1:11:21] your soul, what happens? You begin to
[1:11:25] put the works of the flesh to death.
[1:11:30] And many are our at least my mind, I I
[1:11:32] don't want to impute that to you, but
[1:11:34] our minds put that black and white. But
[1:11:36] understand, it's a it's a process. It's
[1:11:39] progressive.
[1:11:40] what what was acceptable to me the day
[1:11:44] after the Lord delivered me uh would be
[1:11:47] uh mortified
[1:11:49] to to do today. The words that I spoke
[1:11:54] out of my mouth when I was frustrated I
[1:11:57] I don't say them anymore. Thank the Lord
[1:12:01] doesn't mean you're lost. It doesn't
[1:12:03] mean you're going to hell. It means
[1:12:04] God's working.
[1:12:06] If you have the spirit, if you're led by
[1:12:08] the spirit, you're putting it to death.
[1:12:11] You're going to put it to death. That's
[1:12:12] part of the life of Christ in you is
[1:12:15] killing this flesh
[1:12:18] and its nature.
[1:12:22] But we are bound to give thanks always
[1:12:25] to God for you, brethren, beloved of the
[1:12:28] Lord, because God has from the beginning
[1:12:31] chosen you to salvation
[1:12:34] through sanctification of the spirit and
[1:12:37] belief of the truth. What am I trying to
[1:12:39] get at? I made my point before that the
[1:12:42] man that assures himself, I'll have
[1:12:44] peace even though I walk according to
[1:12:47] the imagination of my own heart.
[1:12:50] He he assures himself, "I'm part of the
[1:12:52] covenant. I'm a part of God's covenant.
[1:12:56] I will have peace even though my life
[1:12:59] doesn't line up and I do and live
[1:13:01] however I want to do." That is not
[1:13:04] salvation. Salvation
[1:13:07] is through something. See there we see
[1:13:09] there is a there's a motion through.
[1:13:13] So salvation comes through something.
[1:13:15] What is it? What what is that that comes
[1:13:17] through? sanctification of the spirit
[1:13:20] and the belief of the truth. So if you
[1:13:23] have the holy spirit living in you,
[1:13:26] right? Uh that's what that's what being
[1:13:28] part of the new covenant is. That's what
[1:13:31] uh uh having the earnest of our ultimate
[1:13:34] salvation, right? Having a new body,
[1:13:37] having the immortal body,
[1:13:40] that's going to produce a holy life.
[1:13:42] That's going to produce a changed life.
[1:13:44] That's going to that's going to bring
[1:13:46] you into holiness. It's going to make
[1:13:49] you holy because be holy for I am holy,
[1:13:53] God says. And so that you're going to
[1:13:55] believe the truth, right? And you're
[1:13:58] going to be sanctified by believing that
[1:14:01] truth.
[1:14:05] Brother Brandham says, "You don't have
[1:14:06] to say, "Oh, if I could just quit
[1:14:07] drinking. If I could just just get in
[1:14:10] Christ and it's all gone." See? See?
[1:14:12] Because your body is subject to the
[1:14:14] spirit. It's no more subject to the
[1:14:16] things of the world. They're dead. They
[1:14:18] are dead. Your sins are buried in
[1:14:20] baptism and you're a new creation in
[1:14:22] Christ and your body becoming subject to
[1:14:25] the spirit. Try to live a right kind of
[1:14:29] life.
[1:14:29] Amen.
[1:14:30] Like you women claiming you got the Holy
[1:14:32] Ghost and going out here and wearing
[1:14:33] shorts and things. How could you do it?
[1:14:35] How could the spirit of God in you ever
[1:14:37] let you do such a thing as that? It just
[1:14:39] can't be so. Certainly can't be. He's
[1:14:42] not a filthy spirit. He's a holy spirit.
[1:14:45] Amen.
[1:14:47] Amen.
[1:14:49] 1 John 2:29.
[1:14:53] If you know that he is righteous, you
[1:14:55] know that everyone that doeth
[1:14:57] righteousness
[1:14:58] is born of him.
[1:15:02] Again,
[1:15:05] it looks like it's almost backwards. If
[1:15:07] you're doing righteousness, you're born
[1:15:09] of him, right? That's that's what we're
[1:15:11] trying to say. If you're born again, you
[1:15:14] will do righteousness.
[1:15:17] It will produce a life of righteousness.
[1:15:18] We can't we can't think somehow that
[1:15:23] well, I can live however I want to. I'm
[1:15:25] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:15:27] the world. As I said, I think in the
[1:15:29] first uh part one of this is one of the
[1:15:33] one of the greatest signs to see that
[1:15:36] you're not predestinated is that you say
[1:15:40] doesn't matter how I live. God God chose
[1:15:42] me.
[1:15:43] No, he did not.
[1:15:46] I don't believe that.
[1:15:48] Either that or you'll come to
[1:15:49] repentance.
[1:15:50] I'll I'll I'll hold out hope. Maybe
[1:15:52] there isn't any. But I'll hold out hope
[1:15:55] that you'll come to repentance and
[1:15:57] realize that uh if you're born of him,
[1:16:00] you'll do righteousness.
[1:16:05] We can't think that we live an
[1:16:08] unrighteous life uncaring. We don't even
[1:16:10] care about it. That's the thing is the
[1:16:12] people that are in that condition, they
[1:16:14] don't care. They're not concerned. They
[1:16:17] sin and they say, "God's God's full of
[1:16:20] forgiveness. He is full of forgiveness.
[1:16:23] But if that's our immediate feeling
[1:16:27] after we've sinned, we have a serious
[1:16:30] heart issue.
[1:16:32] There's a serious brokenness. Because
[1:16:34] the first thing is I've hurt my father.
[1:16:39] I've sinned against my father.
[1:16:41] If you think about it,
[1:16:43] in some ways, uh Saul was a better chap
[1:16:46] than David from humanly speaking.
[1:16:51] You know, David was a murderer, an
[1:16:54] adulterer.
[1:16:56] Saul uh he fulfilled most of the
[1:17:00] commands.
[1:17:02] You know, the great the great
[1:17:04] the great king went forward and he
[1:17:07] conquered the enemy, right? I mean, he
[1:17:08] had the king in in custody.
[1:17:11] He took he took all their animals,
[1:17:15] but that's what that wasn't the command.
[1:17:20] That wasn't what he was told to do. And
[1:17:23] when he was confronted about it by the
[1:17:25] prophet, what was his response? Oh, no.
[1:17:27] I I obeyed.
[1:17:32] I followed the word of the Lord. And
[1:17:34] Samuel says, "What's the sound of the
[1:17:36] bleeding of sheep and and
[1:17:39] the mooing of the cows?
[1:17:42] What's going on with that?"
[1:17:44] Oh, the people flew on the spoil.
[1:17:50] Well, since you've rejected the word of
[1:17:52] the Lord, the Lord has rejected you from
[1:17:55] being king. Oh, I've sinned.
[1:17:59] I've sinned. Only honor me in front of
[1:18:01] the people. That's not repentance.
[1:18:06] That was only outward
[1:18:08] in the flesh
[1:18:10] wanting to wanting to be seen by men to
[1:18:14] be righteous. Samuel, come with me. If
[1:18:16] you don't come with me and honor me
[1:18:18] here, people will wonder what's up.
[1:18:21] David is confronted. You're that man.
[1:18:24] I have sinned against the Lord.
[1:18:28] That's the heart of the predestinated
[1:18:30] seed is I have sinned against the Lord.
[1:18:32] You and you only have I sinned against
[1:18:35] Lord. Oh, he sinned against a lot of
[1:18:36] other people, but that was his main
[1:18:38] concern is that he broke fellowship,
[1:18:42] hurt the heart of his father.
[1:18:44] That was his main concern. Saul's
[1:18:46] concern was how do I look in front of
[1:18:47] the people?
[1:18:49] I don't I don't care about following. I
[1:18:51] didn't I followed it mostly. Isn't that
[1:18:53] good enough? And this is the attitude of
[1:18:56] those who are not right with God.
[1:19:01] I followed it mostly. I did the best I
[1:19:03] could. Did you?
[1:19:06] Were you confronted? I mean many and
[1:19:09] many times it's not a prophet coming to
[1:19:10] us in the flesh but many times it's a
[1:19:13] prophet on a tape or it's a preacher in
[1:19:15] a service and what's our attitude and we
[1:19:18] sweep it away we push it away no big
[1:19:20] deal nobody else knows about it so it
[1:19:22] doesn't really matter.
[1:19:25] No we've hurt our father and our first
[1:19:28] reaction should be Lord forgive me.
[1:19:32] That's that is there's no such thing as
[1:19:35] easy belieism or this
[1:19:39] sickly grace that allows you to be in
[1:19:41] this position that you don't care
[1:19:43] whether or not you sinner sin.
[1:19:47] Amen. That was from another sermon.
[1:19:52] All right. I you guys could see that and
[1:19:54] that one is driving me crazy so I'm not
[1:19:56] going to look. 1 John 2:29.
[1:19:59] All right. No. 1 John 3:2, "Beloved, now
[1:20:03] are we the sons of God, not in the
[1:20:05] future, now. And it doth not yet appear
[1:20:08] what we shall be, but we know that when
[1:20:11] he shall appear, we shall be like him,
[1:20:13] for we shall see him as he is." Oh man,
[1:20:20] I better just keep reading. And every
[1:20:22] man that hath this hope in him in him
[1:20:26] purifith himself even as he is pure.
[1:20:32] Again we we see all this these
[1:20:35] stipulations
[1:20:37] in that sense I would put it that way.
[1:20:39] The the apostles are putting this is a
[1:20:42] stipulation so that you can understand
[1:20:45] this is the person that has the hope in
[1:20:47] himself. Who's the person that has the
[1:20:50] hope in himself?
[1:20:51] the one that purifies himself.
[1:20:54] Even as God himself is pure, just as God
[1:20:57] is pure, the man that has the hope of
[1:21:01] the appearing.
[1:21:03] Amen. It's beyond It's beyond merely
[1:21:06] hope for us today. It's revelation for
[1:21:09] us today.
[1:21:13] Amen.
[1:21:16] as as I think it's first Peter says the
[1:21:19] salvation that will be revealed at the
[1:21:21] appearing of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:25] Well, it's been revealed the opening of
[1:21:27] the seven seals.
[1:21:29] Who is this Melkisedc?
[1:21:31] Isn't it strange that in a sermon like
[1:21:34] who is this Melkisedc? We find out the
[1:21:36] mystery of our lives.
[1:21:39] Amen.
[1:21:40] All right. I'm going to
[1:21:43] I'm going to invite the uh musicians and
[1:21:46] we'll begin to close
[1:21:49] and and then when you become subject to
[1:21:53] that spirit, it throws your whole being
[1:21:57] subject to that spirit.
[1:21:59] And that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:22:02] but and I remember listening to who is
[1:22:04] this Melkisedc? You can hear brother
[1:22:05] Brandham pat his Bible. And that spirit
[1:22:08] is in nothing in the world but this seed
[1:22:11] word made manifest or quickened.
[1:22:15] Hallelujah. Made alive. And when the
[1:22:17] Bible said don't do this, that body
[1:22:20] quickly turns to it. There is no
[1:22:22] question. And what is it? It's the
[1:22:25] earnest of the resurrection. The body
[1:22:28] will re be raised up again because it's
[1:22:31] already started. Hallelujah. the resurre
[1:22:34] not the resurrection that was in the
[1:22:36] past but the resurrection that you have
[1:22:37] now that's in your body right now the
[1:22:40] quickening power that's there that's a
[1:22:43] part of you
[1:22:45] it's already started it was it was once
[1:22:48] subject to sin and meer and corruption
[1:22:51] but now it's got the earnest man it's
[1:22:54] got the down payment it's turned
[1:22:56] heavenly now that's the earnest that
[1:22:58] you're going in the rapture it's the
[1:23:01] earnest
[1:23:02] What assurance
[1:23:05] that we have?
[1:23:07] What is the earnest that you're going in
[1:23:09] the rapture? That that spirit has come
[1:23:11] into you and that your bo this body,
[1:23:14] this corruptible body has turned
[1:23:17] heavenward, has turned heavenly. The
[1:23:20] nature that's inside of it has changed.
[1:23:23] There's something new there. It's
[1:23:24] producing a new life. It's purifying
[1:23:27] itself. It's being made holy. It's being
[1:23:31] sanctified.
[1:23:32] It it's producing a life that's putting
[1:23:35] to death the works of the flesh. The
[1:23:38] that's that when we realize in this body
[1:23:42] in this process, right? We talked about
[1:23:44] there's three processes. There's three
[1:23:46] parts of that. We were in his mind
[1:23:48] before the foundation of the world. We
[1:23:51] all actually already have a body that
[1:23:53] the Bible says is eternal in the
[1:23:55] heavens, a theophony. And even when the
[1:23:58] word comes forth and convicts our heart,
[1:24:00] we've heard from our theophony. So
[1:24:03] there's a there's a connection between
[1:24:04] this the soul the seed gene and that
[1:24:07] theophony there. And when the word comes
[1:24:10] forth and and we add word to on top of
[1:24:12] word, it's also building that theophony
[1:24:17] to make us ready to enter into it. It's
[1:24:19] incredible to think about. So you have
[1:24:22] that. So, so the sign
[1:24:25] that we actually have a body to enter
[1:24:29] into that's eternal in the heavens is
[1:24:31] that this one's already turned
[1:24:34] heavenward. It's got the spirit of God
[1:24:36] into it. It's quickened that seed gene
[1:24:38] and so then instead of being tied here,
[1:24:41] we're tied there.
[1:24:43] Amen. That's that's the next part to get
[1:24:47] to the other part to part two, the
[1:24:49] theophony. Then it's when the when those
[1:24:51] two become one, it be that theophony
[1:24:54] body and this body becomes one. Then
[1:24:57] what is it? It's the glorified body.
[1:25:00] Praise the Lord. The same process that
[1:25:03] God goes through is the same process
[1:25:06] that his sons go through. Hallelujah.
[1:25:09] Let's pray. Let's stand and pray.
[1:25:14] Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[1:25:16] for your word, Lord.
[1:25:18] We're so grateful for this revelation in
[1:25:21] this hour. We pray, Lord, that it would
[1:25:24] it would go far beyond
[1:25:28] teaching and and words in a book, Lord,
[1:25:31] but it that you'd take it and quicken it
[1:25:33] to our hearts, Lord.
[1:25:35] May it not be something that's a
[1:25:37] confusion, but may it be a reality,
[1:25:40] Lord. May we truly turn heavenward.
[1:25:45] May our lives, Lord, be be purified,
[1:25:49] Lord, even as you are pure.
[1:25:53] We thank you for these things, Lord.
[1:25:56] We're just grateful
[1:25:59] to be given eyes to see and and ears to
[1:26:02] hear the great things you've done in
[1:26:04] this day. Lord,
[1:26:08] we pray your Holy Spirit would just
[1:26:11] sweep through every heart.
[1:26:15] Those listening
[1:26:16] on the stream, the recording, Lord,
[1:26:18] those listening here, may your presence
[1:26:21] come near to them, Lord.
[1:26:24] Speak speak the revelation
[1:26:27] beyond the words of a man, but the the
[1:26:31] very voice of God into their hearts.
[1:26:34] the very revelation of the word
[1:26:38] that they are one they're they're one of
[1:26:40] yours that you're that they're a part of
[1:26:43] your life
[1:26:45] Lord and they're they'll come to full
[1:26:48] manifestation just as you will come to
[1:26:51] full manifestation Lord we thank you for
[1:26:55] that we give you praise Lord in Jesus

[1:29:17] Number of prayer requests tonight.
[1:29:21] Um
[1:29:22] the first one is is uh traveling Mercy's
[1:29:25] for uh myself and my family. We're going
[1:29:29] up to Edmonton to get some rest and
[1:29:32] relaxation. I mean that was my plan but
[1:29:35] been already asked to preach uh two
[1:29:38] times and then just as I was in the
[1:29:40] study to take some Sunday school class.
[1:29:44] So I guess some rest and some work. So,
[1:29:49] we praise the Lord. Keep us in prayer as
[1:29:52] we travel. Uh, Brother Jack uh writes
[1:29:55] in, "Please pray for us." Sister Kathy
[1:29:58] doesn't want to go back for any
[1:30:00] treatment because the financial system
[1:30:01] isn't willing to work with us on a
[1:30:03] reasonable payment plan. Kathy has
[1:30:06] stated that she will not return for
[1:30:07] treatment. So, we'll trust God Almighty
[1:30:09] to heal her or take her home.
[1:30:12] Our Lord is the same God who healed
[1:30:14] people instantly. Amen.
[1:30:16] There was a prophet I never got to meet
[1:30:18] who said he has seen God heal the worst
[1:30:20] kinds of cancer simply by taking them at
[1:30:22] his word. If they can't work with us on
[1:30:25] payments it's completely in the Lord's
[1:30:27] hands. And I know that sister Kathy and
[1:30:29] I are true believers. Love you all.
[1:30:32] Brother Jack,
[1:30:33] may God bless brother Jack. He's his
[1:30:37] faith is truly uh inspiration. Every one
[1:30:40] of us, sister Kathy's as well. It's just
[1:30:44] uh love that faith.
[1:30:47] Um from Sister Kathy, also please have
[1:30:49] church pray for pain in my legs and feet
[1:30:52] that keeps me awake at night that our
[1:30:54] Lord will take it away. Amen. And uh
[1:30:58] Brother Matt and Brother Jason, our
[1:31:01] pastor, and sister Zoe and sister Ma
[1:31:05] will be going to Poland June 12th to
[1:31:07] 17th. pray for traveling mercies for
[1:31:10] them and for the services there.
[1:31:14] Amen. How many will pray for them?
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:18] Let's remember them every day. Sister
[1:31:20] Melissa writes, "I have some unspoken
[1:31:23] prayer requests for tonight. Thank you,
[1:31:25] brother Gideon Watkins. Please pray for
[1:31:28] Anna tonight. She has a bad stomach
[1:31:30] flu." And uh the prayer request for
[1:31:33] Brother David and Sister Laura Gadman.
[1:31:36] Brother David has severe colitis in his
[1:31:38] entire colon. Surgeons said that the
[1:31:41] inside of his colon looks like hamburger
[1:31:43] meat. My
[1:31:45] They're very concerned about it. He must
[1:31:47] have eaten something bad that has
[1:31:49] completely messed up his colon. Surgery
[1:31:51] is postponed for at least a month
[1:31:53] because the colon has to heal before the
[1:31:54] surgeons can do anything to it. And
[1:31:57] Sister Laura Gadman is also battling a
[1:31:59] viral lung infection and pneumonia.
[1:32:02] Amen. They need a touch from the Lord.
[1:32:05] Also uh testimony from sister Meredith
[1:32:08] update on her brother Michael. Mom was
[1:32:10] able to talk to him today and they moved
[1:32:13] him from ICU to a step down unit today.
[1:32:15] He's doing well. Thank the Lord. Thank
[1:32:17] you all for praying for him and please
[1:32:20] continue to do so as he recovers. Let's
[1:32:22] let's lift our hearts to the Lord.
[1:32:25] Heavenly Father, we just
[1:32:28] ask for traveling mercies for us, Lord.
[1:32:31] We we ask that you just go before us. We
[1:32:35] pray for brother Jason, brother brother
[1:32:37] Matt, Zoe and Mina, Lord. I pray that
[1:32:40] you would be with them Lord and just the
[1:32:43] the the travel overseas travel can have
[1:32:46] all kinds of adventures. But I pray Lord
[1:32:48] there would be everything would go
[1:32:50] smoothly. There'd be no issues.
[1:32:52] Everything would run on time, no
[1:32:55] problems there. And that Lord the
[1:32:56] medians would be blessed. Lord, I know
[1:32:58] the saints will certainly be blessed by
[1:33:01] those two ministries there. Lord, just
[1:33:03] use them mightily. Lord, may your Holy
[1:33:05] Spirit flow through them, Lord, to the
[1:33:07] hearts of the people. Father, we pray

[1:33:16] those requests. Pray for Sister Anna as
[1:33:20] well, Lord, the stomach flu that she's

[1:35:07] Lord. Any also those who have unspoken
[1:35:10] requests, Lord, that maybe didn't even
[1:35:12] say anything about their unspoken
[1:35:13] request. I pray that you'd move upon
[1:35:16] those things, Lord. Bring healing, bring
[1:35:18] deliverance, Lord. Bring provision,

[1:36:33] your name.
[1:36:35] [Music]
[1:36:36] Amen. Do we have any testimonies
[1:36:38] tonight?
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:44] Wish Brother Brad was here and I could
[1:36:45] just hand this to him.
[1:36:49] The red one.
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:57] It's on. Okay.
[1:37:02] I I made a request for prayer on my car
[1:37:04] before
[1:37:06] prayed about it. And I got praying about
[1:37:08] it, too. Got thinking about something
[1:37:10] simple. I was getting ready to take my
[1:37:12] car down, go have it fixed. Well,
[1:37:15] analyzing is not cheap anymore.
[1:37:18] No more $65
[1:37:20] 85 to $125 $165 they charge for
[1:37:24] analyzing.
[1:37:25] Well, I got prayer and said, "Lord, just
[1:37:27] let it be something simple.
[1:37:29] Find out what this is." It came out
[1:37:32] suddenly. It came up. It's got to be
[1:37:33] something simple. I went through did
[1:37:35] what I know from my mechanical
[1:37:37] abilities, my troubleshooting, what have
[1:37:39] you, and I really didn't find it. And
[1:37:42] then I I guess GPS is on my dash.
[1:37:45] So, I moved it over and it felt
[1:37:49] where this went. Ah, that stupid
[1:37:51] sunroof. I hate these sunroofs. I had it
[1:37:54] taped off. I got a hold of it. Water
[1:37:55] come down there. Little tube that I
[1:37:58] replaced. The elbow that I made slipped
[1:38:00] out. Water came down. This thing called
[1:38:02] the ECM,
[1:38:04] electronic control module. These are
[1:38:06] anywhere from $1,100 to $1,800
[1:38:10] for those. Then the price of installing
[1:38:12] it. So, we're looking at 2,000 $2 and a
[1:38:15] half thousand dollars to replace these
[1:38:16] things. So, I found it. I got going down
[1:38:19] the road. My wife was on and on and on.
[1:38:21] I said, "God, what is it? What is it?" I
[1:38:24] stopped and I parked, let the car set,
[1:38:26] come back out later. Everything's fine.
[1:38:29] Everything's dried out.
[1:38:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:31] So, I said, "Lord, thank you for simple
[1:38:32] things."
[1:38:33] Amen.
[1:38:34] And thank you for the leadership.
[1:38:35] Amen.
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:41] Last Sunday I got prayed for for my back
[1:38:44] and the first time in months I was able
[1:38:46] to simply bend over and put my shoes on
[1:38:50] without any pain. So thank you Lord for
[1:38:52] that.
[1:38:52] Amen.
[1:38:59] Any others?
[1:39:04] I just wanted to thank the Lord. Um, I
[1:39:07] was driving to the office today and um
[1:39:11] was clear. I was making a left um over
[1:39:14] by Lowe's and this little car was trying
[1:39:17] to shoot the the green light and the
[1:39:19] truck in front of me where I was making
[1:39:20] a left didn't clear the intersection as
[1:39:22] fast as it could have and it kind of
[1:39:24] slowed me down and the kind of that no
[1:39:25] man's land and I don't think I've ever
[1:39:27] come that close to actually being hit. I
[1:39:30] don't All I know is I looked up and I
[1:39:33] actually screamed. And I was on the
[1:39:34] speaker phone with Deb and I shrieked
[1:39:36] and all I could see was the grill of the
[1:39:38] car
[1:39:39] and I I couldn't go cuz it was a truck
[1:39:42] ahead of me. I just, you know, went as
[1:39:43] fast I could. I don't know how we
[1:39:44] turned. I I feel like they kind of went
[1:39:46] through the back of my car. I don't
[1:39:48] really know how to explain it, but I'm
[1:39:49] very grateful to be here.
[1:39:51] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:55] [Applause]
[1:40:01] Where's your mic?
[1:40:05] So, uh, tonight on our way to church, we
[1:40:08] had not that far down the road and all
[1:40:10] of a sudden everybody's slamming on
[1:40:12] their brakes. And I don't know what's
[1:40:13] going on, but we were moving pretty
[1:40:15] fast. Next thing I see, the front of a
[1:40:17] car laying on the guard rail upside
[1:40:19] down. And so, I don't know what
[1:40:21] happened, but it just happened.
[1:40:23] Everybody slams on their brakes and this
[1:40:25] car is upside down on the guardrail. But
[1:40:27] thankfully, we were nobody was harmed.
[1:40:30] Hopefully, that guy was okay. We said a
[1:40:32] little prayer for him, but he uh the
[1:40:34] wheel was missing off the car, so I
[1:40:35] don't know if he lost the wheel and the
[1:40:36] thing just started rolling or what
[1:40:37] happened, but yeah, it was it was pretty
[1:40:39] crazy. And everybody just stopped. I
[1:40:41] mean, there was like probably 15 cars
[1:40:42] pulled over on the side. Everybody's
[1:40:44] running across the highway
[1:40:45] trying to rush over to this guy and we
[1:40:47] just kind of moved our way on out on on
[1:40:50] the church. So, thank the Lord for
[1:40:52] keeping us safe, though.
[1:40:53] Yeah. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:56] [Applause]
[1:41:03] [Music]
[1:41:06] Lord, I give you
[1:41:08] Lord. I give you my heart.
[1:41:13] I give you my heart.
