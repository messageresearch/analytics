[27:39] I'm hurting.
[27:41] It seems that you've forsaken.
[27:48] I wonder is your love for me still real?
[27:56] Though my friends think I am happy,
[28:01] unaffected by this trial,
[28:05] they can't see the pain I'm hiding.
[28:11] Underneath my smile,
[28:15] master, I can't live this way anymore.
[28:22] So today I make my choice.
[28:31] I choose to believe that you are
[28:36] faithful.
[28:38] And my heart is in your hands.
[28:42] And this mystery that I face today is
[28:47] part of a gater plan. I choose not to be
[28:53] discouraged
[28:55] when the sun will not break through.
[29:00] I have a true voice of trusting you.
[29:09] So Lord, this is what I choose.
[29:18] I know
[29:20] this road will not be easy.
[29:23] [Music]
[29:26] I know
[29:28] I'll have my weaker
[29:31] days.
[29:34] And Satan
[29:36] will tell me I don't mean it
[29:41] when I say
[29:44] I'll trust God all the way.
[29:50] But that really does matter.
[29:55] I refuse to hear him out.
[29:59] With my faith, I'll find the power that
[30:03] will overcome all doubt.
[30:07] Lord,
[30:09] I've never felt so strong.
[30:14] As when I'm resting
[30:17] in your arms,
[30:21] I choose to believe that you are
[30:26] faithful.
[30:27] And my heart is in your hands.
[30:31] And this mystery that I face today is
[30:36] part of a greater plan. I choose not to
[30:41] be discouraged
[30:43] when the sun will not break through.
[30:47] [Music]
[30:49] I have the choice
[30:54] of trusting you.
[30:58] So Lord, this is what I choose.
[31:05] I choose to believe that you are
[31:10] faithful.
[31:11] And my heart is in your hands.
[31:15] And this mystery that I face today is
[31:20] part of a gater plan.
[31:23] I choose not to be discouraged
[31:27] when the sun will not break through.
[31:32] I have a choice. It's all of our choice
[31:35] tonight of trusting you. So Lord, this
[31:40] is what I choose. Lord, this is what I

[32:12] should choose that one. I choose to
[32:15] believe that my life is in his hands.
[32:17] And this mystery, I mean, whatever you
[32:19] might be facing today, tomorrow that you
[32:22] ain't faced yet, might seem like a

[34:32] of that is Zechariah. And uh we're going
[34:35] to look at this third chapter. I've
[34:38] ministered um on this particular text
[34:41] before, but I just want to bring one
[34:44] aspect of it tonight and refresh your
[34:47] memory. Stir you up as Peter said by way
[34:49] of remembrance.
[34:51] So tonight be our fourth installment in
[34:54] in this very important title, our part
[34:56] in the inheritance. As I said to you,
[35:00] did you know you have an inheritance?
[35:03] And I've said to you, did you know that
[35:05] God has a certain sheet music for you to
[35:08] play? And so, you know, we're looking at
[35:11] this again tonight. Zechariah 3, verse
[35:15] one.
[35:18] And I just wanted to uh also say how
[35:20] much I appreciate the other all the
[35:22] special singing. Amen. And Little Red,
[35:25] we've been waiting on that from her for
[35:26] a while. We're happy to have John's
[35:28] family with us tonight. uh Zechariah 3
[35:31] chapter 3 verse 1.
[35:36] This is Zachchariah in a vision and
[35:38] said, "And he showed me Joshua the high
[35:42] priest standing before the angel of the
[35:45] Lord and Satan standing at his right
[35:48] hand to resist him."
[35:51] And the Lord said unto Satan, "The Lord
[35:53] rebuke thee, oh Satan, even the Lord
[35:56] that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee.
[35:58] Is not this a brand plucked out of the
[36:01] fire? And the Lord was the one who did
[36:04] the plucking. See, now Joshua was
[36:08] clothed with filthy garments and stood
[36:10] before the angel. And he answered and
[36:13] spake unto those that stood before him,
[36:15] saying, Take away the filthy garments
[36:17] from him. And unto him he said, Behold,
[36:20] I have caused thine iniquity. I have
[36:23] caused thine iniquity to pass from thee,
[36:26] and I will clothe thee with change of
[36:29] reignment. So, I've qualified you to
[36:32] wear the garment of the word. Amen. You
[36:34] could have never done it. You came into
[36:36] the world. You were filthy, broken, and
[36:38] no chance. And God says, I have
[36:41] qualified you. See, so and he answered
[36:45] uh and he said, I have caused thine
[36:47] iniquity to pass from thee, and I will
[36:48] clothe thee with a change of reignment.
[36:50] And I said, this is Zachchariah getting
[36:53] stirred up. And I said, "Let them set a
[36:56] fair miter upon his head." So they set a
[36:59] fair miter upon his head and clothed him
[37:01] with garments. And the angel of the Lord
[37:03] stood by. And the angel of the Lord
[37:06] protested unto Joshua, saying, Now that
[37:08] protesting is not like we would think
[37:10] normally. It just means he's veinently
[37:13] trying to make this point. Jo Joshua, I
[37:16] want you to remember what I've done and
[37:18] what I'm saying. This is not a small
[37:20] thing. See, thus saith the Lord of
[37:23] hosts, if thou wilt walk in my ways,
[37:27] see, he's making a covenant. And if thou
[37:29] wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt
[37:32] also judge mine house, and shalt also
[37:35] keep my courts, and I will give thee
[37:38] places to walk among these that stand
[37:40] by.
[37:42] Hear now, oh Joshua the high priest,
[37:44] thou and thy fellows that sit before
[37:48] thee, for they are men wondered at. For
[37:50] behold, I will bring forth my servant
[37:53] the branch.
[37:55] For behold, the stone that I have laid
[37:58] before Joshua, even one stone shall be
[38:00] seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave the
[38:05] graving thereof, saith the Lord of
[38:07] Hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of
[38:11] that land in one day. In that day, saith
[38:16] the Lord of hosts, shall ye call every
[38:20] man his neighbor under the vine, and
[38:23] under the fig tree.
[38:26] There is so much there uh and I'm just
[38:28] going to struggle to only take one
[38:30] aspect of it. But let's pray.
[38:34] Master, we thank you for your word read
[38:38] aloud. We thank you for all of the
[38:40] singing and the praise and the worship.
[38:42] I thank you Lord for the anointing that
[38:45] I have felt upon this thought and your
[38:48] careful guidance and direction on what
[38:50] to say, when to say, and how to say it.
[38:53] I pray master that you will give me
[38:56] uncction now before the people. I
[38:58] humbled myself as the prophet said. I
[39:00] humbled myself and then I humbled myself
[39:03] again. Lord, we want to be just your
[39:06] servant standing here tonight as we
[39:08] break the bread of life. Lord, I have
[39:10] nothing to say of my own. This is all
[39:13] from you. We would have had nothing,
[39:15] Lord, had it not been for a message that
[39:17] you gave to us. We'd have just been
[39:19] another talking head. Just yet another.
[39:22] We'd have been 40,01
[39:24] in a long line of various independent
[39:27] interpretations of the one gospel had it
[39:30] not been for your message that you sent
[39:32] us. So I thank you for that Lord. I
[39:35] thank you for your messenger. I thank
[39:37] you for the message. And Father, most of
[39:40] all, we thank you for Jesus Christ. We
[39:43] thank you for that day on Calvary and
[39:45] what it has secured for us in the Holy
[39:48] Ghost. We commit it to you now. commit
[39:50] all of this into your hands. You are our
[39:52] leader in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[39:55] you friends. You can be seated. Tony,
[39:57] hand me that water there. Yeah. Okay.
[40:00] All right. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[40:04] So,
[40:07] thank you, brother Mike.
[40:09] You don't look like Tony anymore than I
[40:11] look like Diggs.
[40:16] Amen. So
[40:19] I I'll come to our text here just in a
[40:22] moment. But
[40:24] with the point that I want to make, but
[40:26] but just to give you and fix your mind
[40:29] on the background of what you're
[40:31] reading, you're you're reading a a court
[40:34] docket. you're reading uh the minutes uh
[40:38] and and and and the and the court record
[40:42] of a trial that was held where Satan has
[40:46] filed suit against God because and the
[40:52] whole premise of his case before the
[40:55] Lord. He's challenging the supremacy of
[40:58] Christ because Satan feels that he can
[41:02] now prove he he he feels like he must
[41:06] prove and feels like he can prove in the
[41:08] presence of of the king that he can he
[41:12] can prove that God's word has failed
[41:17] because God had said that Israel was his
[41:21] people. He had said they are his chosen
[41:23] people. He had said they are his
[41:25] peculiar people. He had said they are
[41:28] they are his chosen race. He he he said
[41:31] they were separated and he took them out
[41:34] of Egypt and he brought them through the
[41:36] land. And the prophet rises up, you
[41:38] know, in one place there in the Old
[41:40] Testament and says and just and just
[41:42] relates the story how that God brought
[41:45] two and a two and a half million member
[41:47] nation out of a nation, walked them
[41:49] through the wilderness and kept them
[41:51] safe for 40 years and crossed them over
[41:53] into a promised land. And the prophet
[41:55] says, "Have you ever heard of such a
[41:57] thing in your whole life in all the
[42:00] world that such a God did such a great
[42:02] thing?" And it was profound and it was
[42:06] it was epic and and and it wasn't a
[42:08] small thing that God did and all the
[42:11] comments to Joshua. No man will stand
[42:14] before thee all the days of your life.
[42:15] Be strong and of a good courage and
[42:17] you'll take over this land. And and
[42:20] Caleb went and took his possession. And
[42:21] the children of Israel begin to fan out.
[42:24] But you know by and by they begin to
[42:26] cool down. And by and by they begin to
[42:29] get soft. And the Lord said, "Every time
[42:31] I bless you, you get fat and you get
[42:33] lazy, and then I then the I have to send
[42:36] the enemy in to correct you, and then
[42:38] you cry to me, then I send you a
[42:39] deliverer." And this cycle goes on and
[42:42] on and on. And and Israel was was guilty
[42:46] of heinous crimes against uh God's word.
[42:51] And they were they were not only
[42:53] worshiping idols and false gods, but
[42:56] they were trying to hide and do it and
[42:58] trying to do it in secret. and and and
[43:00] as if they could hide something from
[43:02] God, right? Amen. That just shows you
[43:05] the insanity that they got to and it
[43:08] shows you the insanity that you see in
[43:11] Christendom today around the world that
[43:13] people just disregard God's word and
[43:16] somehow they're so blind they imagine he
[43:19] won't see it or he don't care or it
[43:21] don't matter. Oh, it matters. Amen. I
[43:25] promise you it matters. Jesus warned
[43:27] them that not a single word, not a jot
[43:30] or a tit, not not an iota of his word
[43:34] would ever be let go of. That no one
[43:38] will get off the hook and their only
[43:40] chance is to obey the word of God. And
[43:43] so, but the problem is that man is born
[43:46] in sin. And Paul talks about that in the
[43:48] book of Romans. The law wasn't evil. The
[43:50] law was good. The law was sent to for my
[43:53] life. The law was sent to train me how
[43:55] to get ready for Messiah. That's what
[43:57] the law was for. It It's so that I could
[44:00] be a light to the Gentiles under a
[44:02] temporary uh way of sacrifices and
[44:05] offerings, waiting and and my life and
[44:08] everything we're doing in Israel should
[44:10] be testifying of the coming Messiah.
[44:13] Listen, friends, your life should be
[44:15] testifying there's a rapture coming.
[44:18] Your life should be testifying something
[44:20] more than the world is testifying to.
[44:23] I'm here to tell you I want to have my
[44:25] life as we've been saying. I want my
[44:28] life to be a living testimony. A song
[44:30] that's where the music and the lyrics
[44:32] both and conducted under his under his
[44:35] guidance.
[44:38] So because Israel you know and Paul says
[44:42] the problem was not with the law. The
[44:44] law was good. He said, "But the problem
[44:47] became
[44:49] our sinful flesh."
[44:52] And so the so the problem was we
[44:55] couldn't keep it. We were always
[44:57] transgressing it. And even when I would
[44:59] do good, evil was still present. And the
[45:02] good that I would sometimes I didn't.
[45:04] And the evil which I didn't want to do,
[45:05] sometimes I did it. And Paul's talking
[45:07] about, you know, not only before his
[45:10] conversion, even though he was a
[45:12] Pharisee of Pharisees, he's still
[45:15] admitting prior to his conversion the
[45:17] problems that he had. And he goes on to
[45:20] admit that even after his conversion,
[45:22] there's still two dogs fighting. He's
[45:24] still got a problem in his flesh. And he
[45:26] says, "Who will deliver me from this
[45:29] body of death?" I thank God through
[45:32] Jesus Christ. He has given me a covenant
[45:36] that the Holy Ghost has redeemed me, but
[45:38] someday he's not going to leave me in
[45:40] this broken condition. He's not I'm not
[45:42] going to heaven and have to still fight
[45:44] this flesh. Someday I'm going to get a
[45:47] new body likened under his glorious
[45:49] body. Hallelujah.
[45:52] So, the problem was not with the law,
[45:54] but Satan Satan through trickery, Satan
[45:58] abused. And so the law which was
[46:01] intended for my good was killing me and
[46:05] it became a death sentence. So now here
[46:08] Satan is coming in to the court of
[46:11] heaven and saying listen God. This is
[46:14] what you said about these people. They
[46:16] would be holy. They'd be separate. Uh
[46:18] sayeth the Lord. I'll clean sprinkle
[46:20] clean water. I'll do all these things.
[46:22] I'll cause them to keep my word. They're
[46:24] my chosen people. Can a woman forget her
[46:26] suckling babe? She might even do that.
[46:29] But I could never forget Israel. They're
[46:31] inscribed in the palms of my hands. And
[46:33] and you talked about how they'd be
[46:34] overcomers and how they will inherit.
[46:37] They're the children of Abraham. But
[46:39] I've got DNA evidence and highdefin
[46:42] video that they haven't done a very good
[46:44] job like you said they would do. Amen.
[46:48] And I've got absolute evidence, cold
[46:51] hard facts, not here with hyperbole or
[46:54] conspiracy. I've got absolute evidence
[46:58] that they are sinners and you said they
[47:01] were your chosen. They have been
[47:03] breaking the word. You said you'd cause
[47:04] them to keep it. And your word, they
[47:07] have failed. Therefore, your word has
[47:10] failed. Oh, friends. And God's response
[47:14] to that is is is is a dismissal of
[47:19] Satan's case on a single premise
[47:24] that once God plays this point forward,
[47:28] all other evidence is null and void.
[47:32] It's not even heard by the court. And
[47:34] the evidence is, how dare you come into
[47:38] my court and try to charge my people.
[47:41] Uh, do you not know that this is
[47:43] Jerusalem whom I have chosen? Do you
[47:45] understand that this is my family? This
[47:48] is the royal family. They are exempt
[47:51] from indictment. They cannot be
[47:53] convicted, charged or even arrested by
[47:56] you. Your case is dismissed and get out
[48:00] of here. Don't ever come back because
[48:03] they are believe. You say, "Yeah, but
[48:05] they're but they're failing." But
[48:06] Abraham had failures in his in his
[48:09] flesh. But under the new covenant, God
[48:12] declared what mattered most is that he
[48:15] staggered not in his faith.
[48:19] It it it's it's not a it's it's not
[48:22] saying that it doesn't matter if we make
[48:24] a mistake. It matters. But what the new
[48:27] covenant was saying, what matters most
[48:30] is that Abraham staggered not at the
[48:32] promises of God. Amen. And that's what
[48:36] counted. And so God simply booted him
[48:40] and booted the case and to make it, you
[48:43] know, uh, doubly secure. He he sealed it
[48:47] with an oath, promised it to himself,
[48:50] promised him a spotless bride and a
[48:51] chosen people. Nothing can ever uphend
[48:54] that. There's no court that can ever
[48:56] overturn that decision. And the only one
[48:59] that could overturn it is the only one
[49:00] who won't, and that's God. Because he
[49:02] can't change his mind about his word.
[49:04] And if you are part of his word, then he
[49:06] can't change his mind about you.
[49:09] He saw our shortcomings and our falls.
[49:12] But he but it but the thing that
[49:14] mattered most was that Abraham staggered
[49:16] not at the promise. He made plenty of
[49:18] mistakes.
[49:20] So when we were So now I just want to
[49:23] put that in your mind for a minute.
[49:26] So, we talked about when we closed out
[49:29] last time, we closed out with making the
[49:32] point that it was not the church, you
[49:36] know, uh that walked off of the edge and
[49:40] plunged into the abyss and and that
[49:43] church that brother Brandham saw, you
[49:45] know, of the world. And he said they
[49:48] went off and stepped off and in another
[49:50] place he said, "All the awful screams
[49:52] you ever heard." And we we closed out
[49:55] last time pointing you to the fact that
[49:58] it was not that church that decided.
[50:01] They just some one day decided we no
[50:04] longer want to be the mouthpiece of God.
[50:05] They actually still try to claim they
[50:07] are to this very hour.
[50:10] So it was never them that that that
[50:14] stopped being God's mouthpiece. It was
[50:17] God that took that privilege away from
[50:20] them when they refused to come to his
[50:24] supper, which was a
[50:52] They wanted to be excused from the
[50:54] responsibilities of the word. They
[50:56] weren't interested in God's plan for
[50:58] their life. Uh they they wanted to make
[51:00] great denominational names for
[51:02] themselves. And so the Bible says that
[51:05] God gave them over to it. That's what
[51:07] they wanted. And so God gave them up to
[51:09] their vile affections. If that's what
[51:11] you want, Brother Brandham said, "You
[51:12] wanted you a Superman, you got it. You
[51:14] wanted a big denomination, you got it.
[51:16] That's what God gave you. You wanted
[51:18] this and that's what God gave you. You
[51:20] wanted that. And so God gave it to you.
[51:21] Now, what you going to do with it?"
[51:24] And it was literally the thing that they
[51:26] wanted and they were determined to have.
[51:29] And so God just let them have it. And it
[51:31] and it will lead them to the mark of the
[51:33] beast. Denominations will lead you to
[51:35] the mark of the beast. Full stop.
[51:37] denominations lead to the mark of the
[51:39] beast inescapably.
[51:41] And so they either do that or they
[51:43] dispand as a denomination.
[51:46] So we find that we closed out with Luke
[51:49] 14:24. I say unto you that none of those
[51:51] men which were bidden shall taste of my
[51:54] supper.
[51:55] Now, I I want to and and here's
[51:58] something that I I just stopped abruptly
[52:00] on Sunday because I knew my heart was
[52:04] too full to go on and the Lord seemed to
[52:07] just quicken me to stop immediately. And
[52:09] I think he wanted to do something
[52:12] through our singing and our prayer of
[52:13] the closing. And I believe God is moving
[52:15] in lives, friends.
[52:17] Amen. These things aren't accidents, but
[52:20] I've been around long enough to I I know
[52:22] better than to disobey that voice. And
[52:24] I've I'm glad I've learned to hear it
[52:26] quickly. And so, so you know, I I I was
[52:30] going to make this point that when
[52:33] brother Brandham
[52:35] preaches shalom in 1964
[52:38] and and and and he he's the whole
[52:42] subject matter is, you know, something
[52:44] has happened and we know Isaiah 60 has
[52:47] come and the world is overthrown
[52:50] oversewn in darkness and there's a gross
[52:52] darkness upon the minds of the people
[52:54] and and but but brother Brandham's
[52:56] message instead of being a dire message
[52:59] of doom, he literally says to the
[53:02] church, he acknowledges what's happened.
[53:04] Yeah. Isaiah 60 notwithstanding,
[53:08] but relax, peace, good morning. Shalom,
[53:12] bride. All is well. We have heard the
[53:15] message. Shalom. And all is well. See,
[53:19] so God has been in control. He was in
[53:21] control in those early stages when the
[53:23] bride was still in her infancy. That's
[53:26] brother Brandham's description of the
[53:28] bride when the seals approached. And he
[53:30] says it's a it's a talked about the five
[53:32] stars lining up just prior to the seals.
[53:34] He said, "What is it?" He said, "It's an
[53:35] announcement." He said, "It's a it's a
[53:38] it's a an infant bride and it's
[53:40] approaching. It's it's announcing the
[53:42] approach of it. Something's coming."
[53:44] Just like three stars lined up announced
[53:46] the birth of Christ as an infant uh in
[53:50] in Bethlehem.
[53:52] So, you know, society at large when when
[53:56] brother Brandham is seeing that vision
[53:58] and he comes to the pullpit and tells
[54:00] about it in various places and and I
[54:02] read you in the in the rapture message,
[54:04] one of my favorites uh because there's
[54:07] where he said instead, you know, that uh
[54:09] two or three is getting out of line and
[54:11] I screamed, you know, stay in line and
[54:13] then I think I read you from proving his
[54:15] word where he said I when I came out of
[54:17] the v he said as I was coming out of the
[54:19] vision there two or three of them at the
[54:21] end of the line had got out of step and
[54:23] he said and they were they were try they
[54:26] were hurrying that was the way he
[54:27] described it to get back in step. See
[54:30] and he and he says and instead of going
[54:33] down they started going up.
[54:36] It was the other group who went down.
[54:38] Amen. Amen. Now, society at large, uh,
[54:42] not only society at large, but the
[54:45] infant bride with all of our great
[54:48] preachers that have most of them have
[54:50] now gone on out of that generation. And,
[54:53] you know, I stand here tonight as as as
[54:56] I can say, I once was young and now I'm
[54:58] old. Paul Paul died right around, they
[55:01] think maybe in late 50s, early 60s,
[55:04] which is right where I'm at in my early
[55:05] 60s. Brother Brandham talked about
[55:07] himself being an old man at 5758
[55:09] and I and I and and I and Paul was
[55:12] saying I Paul the aged I write to you
[55:14] and here he is about my age and and you
[55:17] know I I was that young generation. I
[55:20] was just a child an infant and brother
[55:22] Brandham is saying to young men like the
[55:24] age of my dad and my mom in their 20s.
[55:27] He said I you you young men are going to
[55:29] take this and carry it on to the coming
[55:30] of the Lord. And and and I'm here I'm
[55:33] here to tell you I wasn't a young man at
[55:35] that time. But I I was receiving the
[55:38] commission from a child. I knew from a
[55:40] very early age that I would someday
[55:42] carry the gospel and preach the gospel.
[55:44] It was all my dream to travel the world.
[55:46] And and and if I had have chose my life,
[55:49] I wouldn't have chose to be a pastor. I
[55:50] would I would like to have been an
[55:52] apostle like brother JD. I wanted to
[55:54] travel the world. And thank God I got to
[55:56] do that for many years and and managed
[55:58] to preach this gospel on almost all the
[56:01] continents of the earth. And so we find
[56:04] that that the point I want to make is is
[56:08] that no one could see neither the world
[56:12] nor even the bride at large or the world
[56:15] at large. None of them in that day could
[56:18] see that the world how that it would be
[56:22] the world that would just fall off a
[56:24] cliff. Amen. Cuz you're you're you're
[56:27] talking about, you know, when he first
[56:30] has the vision and then he's telling it
[56:31] a few times there through the 60s and
[56:33] and the and the world at that time
[56:35] didn't seem like such a horrible place
[56:37] compared to what it is today. But yet,
[56:39] brother Brandham called it filth
[56:40] everywhere. And we look back at it now.
[56:43] I as as pastor Jason the agent, I look
[56:46] back now and go that was nothing.
[56:49] See, but but but but no one could see
[56:53] that. And I can tell you I I grew up
[56:56] around those senior ministers of one of
[56:59] which I am now. But when I was a young
[57:01] man, I grew up around them. I sat in I
[57:04] sat quietly too young to speak up but
[57:06] hearing those veterans that I grew up
[57:08] around and knew most all of them and and
[57:11] they you can hear that the whole
[57:13] expectation there was nothing imagined
[57:16] that first of all that we would still be
[57:18] here
[57:21] almost seven decades after America
[57:24] turned down the gospel for the last
[57:25] time.
[57:27] When 56 rolled around, it seemed like it
[57:30] was just going to go bang bang bang. And
[57:32] then the next thing you know, the
[57:33] prophets's going forward. Next thing you
[57:35] know, a decade later, the seals are
[57:36] being open and let's all go home. And it
[57:39] was just getting started.
[57:42] See, now in God's mind, it was
[57:44] finishing.
[57:47] Remember, it takes a thousand of our
[57:50] earth years to equal one of his days.
[57:52] Amen.
[57:54] And so, Brother Brandon would even
[57:55] correlate that the the last days. He's
[57:57] he'll come in the last days, brother.
[57:59] I'm sort of like the last 2,000 years.
[58:02] So, to God, that's nothing. But they
[58:05] could not tell what the world would
[58:07] become. And neither could they and I and
[58:09] and neither neither could they tell uh
[58:13] that the bride's
[58:15] uh upward flight had begun. Amen. Amen.
[58:20] They couldn't tell that they're they
[58:23] were then and still are now waiting for
[58:27] some great trumpet and an escalator and
[58:29] everybody's going home to heaven, right?
[58:32] And they're completely unaware that the
[58:35] message that would lift the bride off of
[58:38] the earth was had came with the opening
[58:40] of the seals and the bride was just in
[58:43] her infancy. And there was no way uh
[58:45] that they could that they could detect
[58:47] that the bride had her upward fight had
[58:50] already begun. And as I said to you, it
[58:52] was a preview of the bride. It's what
[58:54] brother Brandham would refer a preview
[58:56] of the bride uh going toward spiritual
[58:59] maturity. See, and they were they were
[59:02] marching to the beat of the restored
[59:05] word. And can I just say as one aged
[59:11] that that that took a while. Amen. Even
[59:15] for the bride to comprehend.
[59:18] It took a while. You're talking about
[59:21] someone who was positive. We would never
[59:22] see 1978. Amen. How long ago was that?
[59:27] And I and I and and that was because
[59:30] that's what everyone believed, right?
[59:33] So it was it took a while even for the
[59:36] bride to begin to comprehend some of
[59:38] these deeper things. And brother
[59:40] Brandham had said that in the remember I
[59:42] read you that he said don't try to make
[59:43] yourself odd. Just let the Lord when
[59:45] he's ready. You don't have to worry.
[59:47] It's not going to get past you. Just
[59:49] serve the Lord. Be humble. Press on.
[59:51] You're just an infant there in the 60s.
[59:54] But but don't worry, bride. He's not
[59:56] coming back for an infant or a little
[59:57] girl. You're going to grow up. I know
[1:00:00] you don't want to hear that. You would
[1:00:01] like to be gone by 1966, but you're not
[1:00:04] going to be. Or 76 or 86 or 96 or 06 or
[1:00:10] 16 and now we're it won't be long. We'll
[1:00:13] be at 26.
[1:00:17] So, but but still to God, it's just the
[1:00:19] last days. Amen. And so we realize that,
[1:00:24] you know, as as that that that we're are
[1:00:28] actually I can just say it now that we
[1:00:31] only really may be just realizing it
[1:00:35] more fully in these closing scenes of
[1:00:38] human history. And I say that as one
[1:00:40] aged. I say that as one who's been
[1:00:42] around, who was born into and grew up
[1:00:44] through this message. I I'm of the
[1:00:47] opinion and I I talked to my brethren
[1:00:50] around the world that really we didn't
[1:00:53] expect to be here. No one expected the
[1:00:56] world to be this crazy
[1:00:59] and yet we are and it is
[1:01:02] but yet also the bride is still going up
[1:01:06] and she's been going up. Now, the key to
[1:01:08] that is that once Enoch started going
[1:01:11] up, he just kept stepping higher and
[1:01:13] higher and higher till finally he
[1:01:16] crossed the threshold and God said, "All
[1:01:17] right, now you're closer here than you
[1:01:19] are there and one of these days we're
[1:01:21] going to be closer to the li to the
[1:01:23] saints and they're going to come up out
[1:01:25] of the ground." Amen.
[1:01:29] We see the realities more today of what
[1:01:32] it meant in the vision to see them go
[1:01:34] off the edge and fall.
[1:01:37] We see of course the same for the other
[1:01:40] group of member nations
[1:01:44] of believers from the from around the
[1:01:46] world which may I say all by itself took
[1:01:50] a while
[1:01:51] because it had to be what Jesus said
[1:01:54] when this gospel meaning the original
[1:01:56] one not the not the one that was an ad
[1:01:59] mixture during the ages say oh Wesley
[1:02:03] took it to the seven seas but that was
[1:02:05] an ad mixture when Jesus when Jesus says
[1:02:09] when this gospel what was the gospel was
[1:02:12] the gospel books and tapes and quotes or
[1:02:15] even a Bible the gospel was the word
[1:02:17] made flesh standing right there and he
[1:02:19] said when this right here has been
[1:02:21] preached and demonstrated through all
[1:02:23] the world then the end will come I'm
[1:02:25] here to tell you we're right on the
[1:02:26] threshold my friends amen
[1:02:32] so the image that the prophet was shown
[1:02:34] was of a a unified bride marching in one
[1:02:39] unified rhythm like a it was a beat.
[1:02:42] Brother Brandham said like onward
[1:02:44] Christian soldiers, you know the song
[1:02:47] marching as to war. And and may I say
[1:02:50] that may I just say this tonight uh with
[1:02:53] perfect courage in my heart that that
[1:02:55] this bride alone
[1:02:58] that this bride following this message
[1:03:02] alone has remained going forward as the
[1:03:07] Christian churches of the earth bowed
[1:03:10] out bowed out from the invitation to the
[1:03:14] wedding supper as they have over the
[1:03:16] last 60 or se almost 70 years since
[1:03:20] America turned its back on the Lord for
[1:03:22] the last time and more than five uh more
[1:03:25] than five decades since the opening of
[1:03:27] the seven seals and the world has
[1:03:29] steadily steadily excused themsel every
[1:03:32] generation has done it and the next
[1:03:34] generation has done it the next
[1:03:36] generation has done it and they have
[1:03:38] walked away we don't want the we don't
[1:03:40] want the word feast the bride alone has
[1:03:44] kept going forward Amen. Amen. Only the
[1:03:48] bride
[1:03:50] has kept going forward absorbing the
[1:03:53] mysteries, eating upon the body word of
[1:03:55] the son of man, being transformed into
[1:03:58] his living image.
[1:04:00] As I said, it's a word feast prepared
[1:04:03] for believers to be in the rapture.
[1:04:07] that sainted bunch of virgin believers
[1:04:13] uh you know their their harmony
[1:04:16] uh the as I keep saying to you their
[1:04:20] harmony of a life song. Amen. Their
[1:04:23] harmony their life playing the melody
[1:04:27] back to the composer is lifting them off
[1:04:31] of the earth. Amen. So this is not a
[1:04:35] small matter. This this isn't about a
[1:04:37] list of dos and don'ts and things you
[1:04:39] should and shouldn't do. This is so
[1:04:41] beyond that. This has almost nothing to
[1:04:43] do with that. Those kind that kind of
[1:04:45] obedience follows a life that is hid
[1:04:48] away in Christ. And the word that you
[1:04:51] are feeding on friends is uniting you
[1:04:53] with the headstone that will become so
[1:04:55] united till the dead for hundreds of
[1:04:58] years are raised from the grave. Amen.
[1:05:01] Their faithful march in that vision to
[1:05:03] the beat and to the rhythm of the word
[1:05:05] was literally lifting them from the
[1:05:07] earth. Brother Brandham said
[1:05:09] as instead of going down, they started
[1:05:11] going up.
[1:05:16] Amen.
[1:05:18] Amen.
[1:05:21] It's it can be disheartening to see the
[1:05:26] world collapsing.
[1:05:28] Amen. Satan with his poisonous spray of
[1:05:33] discouragement at at times it's it's
[1:05:36] almost like you you can feel it all
[1:05:38] around everywhere. Yeah. Amen. And you
[1:05:41] know, but I I I thought about that. I
[1:05:43] thought, you know, it's sad and the
[1:05:45] world is getting lower and lower and
[1:05:48] plunging off of that into the abyss more
[1:05:50] and more and more. And every generation
[1:05:52] gets worse. Every generation the rock
[1:05:54] and roll they're dancing to gets worse.
[1:05:57] Every day the vulgarity gets worse. What
[1:06:00] brother Brandham saw was nothing
[1:06:01] compared to what's seen brother Brandham
[1:06:03] just saw in a vision and was embarrassed
[1:06:06] by it. It wasn't even real. It was just
[1:06:08] a vision. And we see it on the streets
[1:06:11] in reality.
[1:06:14] Oh, but I'm here to tell you friends,
[1:06:16] the further the world goes down, the
[1:06:18] higher we go. the further they go off
[1:06:21] the cliff, the more I'm feel like
[1:06:22] leaving the earth, the higher I feel
[1:06:24] like rising up in Christ.
[1:06:28] You know, the I I've said to you that
[1:06:30] that church didn't decide they they're
[1:06:32] not the ones who decided uh to stop
[1:06:35] being the mouthpiece of God. And let me
[1:06:37] say tonight that you didn't decide to be
[1:06:40] the mouthpiece of God. The Lord said
[1:06:43] unto his servant, "Go out into the
[1:06:45] highways and hedges and compel them to
[1:06:47] come in that my house may be full." And
[1:06:50] he found us in the highways and the
[1:06:52] hedges. And he compelled and we're
[1:06:54] sitting at his table.
[1:06:57] You didn't make up that choice on your
[1:06:58] own. You can't make yourself to sin.
[1:07:01] Listen, friends, you'd have quit a long
[1:07:03] time ago. It's the Holy Spirit making
[1:07:06] you go forward. I don't understand.
[1:07:09] Sometimes it's discouraging. Oh, why are
[1:07:11] you Why don't you turn around? I can't.
[1:07:13] Oh, but you It's so bad. It is. It's
[1:07:16] terrible. I feel awful. Well, then why
[1:07:18] don't you sit down? No way. I gotta keep
[1:07:20] going. When you going to get there? I
[1:07:23] don't know. But I'm going to keep going.
[1:07:26] Hallelujah. I'm not stopping. I'm not
[1:07:28] turning around. I'm not sliding
[1:07:29] backwards. I'm marching to Zion.
[1:07:37] The prophet left the scene, but we kept
[1:07:41] going forward.
[1:07:44] A neurotic age plunged into gross
[1:07:46] darkness all around us,
[1:07:49] but we've kept going forward.
[1:07:53] Not unlike Israel's captivity,
[1:07:56] after America turned down the gospel
[1:07:58] from the Isuza revival, we've remained
[1:08:01] in Babylonian and modern Babylonian
[1:08:04] modern Babylonians worsening condition
[1:08:07] for almost the same 70 years.
[1:08:13] But we just keep going.
[1:08:17] So why do you keep going? Cuz I can't
[1:08:19] not. Right? Where are you getting the
[1:08:22] energy? From above. I've heard the call.
[1:08:26] I feel the pull. Something is calling
[1:08:29] from another world that won't let me be
[1:08:31] comfortable here. Friends, we ought to
[1:08:34] thank God Almighty. Oh, say, "I feel the
[1:08:38] pull of the Holy Spirit. I feel the pull
[1:08:41] of the age." He didn't have to open my
[1:08:43] eyes. He could have easily passed me by.
[1:08:45] eyes. Brother Lennial sings for the age
[1:08:47] I was living in was wretched, poor, and
[1:08:50] blind. But then I heard recognizing your
[1:08:54] day, serpent seed, and perfect faith,
[1:08:57] the breach, and the message of grace.
[1:09:00] Lord, I thank thee. Hallelujah.
[1:09:04] Hallelujah. We kept going, friends. Some
[1:09:07] of the mighty among us fell away, but we
[1:09:10] kept going. Amen.
[1:09:13] We who are alive and remain
[1:09:16] have had our own share of failures and
[1:09:19] missteps. Can I say to you, a prophet
[1:09:21] saw that happening. Yeah. He saw a bride
[1:09:26] at the end of the line getting out of
[1:09:28] step.
[1:09:31] So, we've had our failures. We have.
[1:09:35] Amen. But a prophet saw it happening.
[1:09:39] So, you know what the word to us is?
[1:09:41] Stay in line. Amen. And if she ever
[1:09:45] found herself out of step, you ever find
[1:09:47] yourself out of step? Come on, I'll
[1:09:50] raise up mine. Lord, I just find myself
[1:09:53] I Are you a believer? Yeah, but I'm just
[1:09:55] I'm out of step. You're you're you're
[1:09:58] spiritually on fire. Well, I I I want to
[1:10:00] be, but somehow I'm out of step. And And
[1:10:03] so I And so here's a The prophet's got a
[1:10:05] word for that. Get back in line. Get
[1:10:08] back in step. Stay in line. See,
[1:10:12] we have.
[1:10:14] We do. Amen. Amen. We have. We do. And I
[1:10:20] shall. Yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:10:23] I'll never stop going forward.
[1:10:27] We're going to have some missteps. I've
[1:10:29] had me some missteps. Oh boy.
[1:10:33] But regardless,
[1:10:35] here's a great point.
[1:10:37] Regardless of Satan's objections
[1:10:41] that he tried to bring in Zechariah 3,
[1:10:46] I'm still moving higher.
[1:10:50] Because under this covenant, there is
[1:10:52] now therefore no condemnation even
[1:10:55] possible to them which are in Christ.
[1:10:58] Amen. See,
[1:11:02] we know that election
[1:11:06] true Bible election is not a random
[1:11:09] event,
[1:11:11] but it's something by that God designed
[1:11:14] and put into put into play and it's a
[1:11:17] it's a guarantee. It's a powerful
[1:11:19] guarantee of our belonging to God's
[1:11:23] family. And it's quite unbreakable,
[1:11:26] by the way. Amen. It's unbreakable
[1:11:30] because it's rooted in our spiritual
[1:11:33] origin.
[1:11:35] Amen. That we were our origin was in
[1:11:37] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:11:40] world. My spiritual origin was in
[1:11:42] Christ. I looked the other day, brother
[1:11:44] Nathan Bryant and I were looking over
[1:11:46] some uh some some line there sites that
[1:11:49] uh that carry the lineage and it goes on
[1:11:51] back and they and it's all public domain
[1:11:53] and and we were just looking back. The
[1:11:55] question had come, had there ever been a
[1:11:57] name change? And somebody had suggested
[1:11:59] maybe brother Brandon's family's name
[1:12:00] got changed, but we traced it all the
[1:12:02] way back to through through his daddy,
[1:12:05] which was Charlie, and then his
[1:12:07] grandfather, which I think was Thomas
[1:12:09] Jeff or George Washington Brandom or
[1:12:12] something like that, and then on back to
[1:12:13] his daddy. And when we quit looking, we
[1:12:15] were back into the 1700s and it was
[1:12:16] still seven letters Brandham.
[1:12:19] And so, you know, a lot of times the
[1:12:21] claims people are trying to make are
[1:12:22] just not not true. And and so God God
[1:12:26] had ordained it. Yeah. It was Thomas,
[1:12:28] you know, I I I know why I was thinking
[1:12:30] of Thomas Jefferson now because
[1:12:32] when
[1:12:34] when Thomas Jefferson wrote and pinned
[1:12:39] and he had some help, but it's largely
[1:12:40] his work and he pinned the Declaration
[1:12:43] of Independence.
[1:12:46] When Jefferson was describing our
[1:12:50] rights, yeah, he used the term in the in
[1:12:55] the actual document unaliable. Now, in
[1:12:58] modern day, we call it inaliable. It's
[1:13:00] the same thing. Unalable is an archaic
[1:13:02] way of saying inaliable.
[1:13:05] And what that word meant was that these
[1:13:08] rights such as life, liberty, and the
[1:13:13] pursuit of happiness are inherent human
[1:13:17] rights.
[1:13:20] And and and they are considered natural
[1:13:23] rights that every person possesses
[1:13:27] simply by being human. And that's the
[1:13:30] point Jefferson was making to England,
[1:13:32] to its king, to its parliament, that we
[1:13:36] have a God-given because we're made in
[1:13:39] the image of our creator. We have a
[1:13:42] right to life, liberty, and the pursuit
[1:13:45] of happiness. We have a right to not be
[1:13:48] ruled or controlled by a tyrant. Amen.
[1:13:52] See, and and so so it it means that that
[1:13:57] they're inherent human rights. They are
[1:13:59] considered natural rights that every
[1:14:03] person possesses simply by being human.
[1:14:05] And as such,
[1:14:09] they cannot be taken away. Amen. Unless
[1:14:12] you'd stop being a human.
[1:14:15] As such, these unalienable rights
[1:14:19] cannot be taken away,
[1:14:22] transferred or surrendered
[1:14:25] because they are inherent. See, so when
[1:14:30] the Lord dismissed
[1:14:33] Satan's case and the whole thing was the
[1:14:36] reason that you see that it was Joshua
[1:14:38] the high priest, now this is not Joshua
[1:14:40] followed Moses. This is Joshua the high
[1:14:42] priest. And the reason it's Joshua the
[1:14:45] high priest is because God didn't need
[1:14:47] Satan didn't need to bring all of Israel
[1:14:50] who had ever lived into the courtroom.
[1:14:52] All he had to do was bring in the high
[1:14:54] priest because the high priest
[1:14:55] represented the whole nation and in the
[1:14:58] and in the the atonement the high priest
[1:15:00] brought and and did the sacrifice and
[1:15:02] and and on the day of atonement and if
[1:15:05] God accepted it then it was for the all
[1:15:07] Israel. You understand? So you you
[1:15:10] understand the scene. So when the Lord
[1:15:13] dismissed Satan's case, he did it
[1:15:16] actually did it on the strength of this
[1:15:19] alone. His chosen people are his by
[1:15:24] origin. See, now his offspring, here's
[1:15:29] here's the rub. His offspring are born
[1:15:31] in sin. And therefore, Paul says, even
[1:15:36] even before we were converted, we were
[1:15:38] hes of God.
[1:15:41] But now we are joint hes with Christ
[1:15:43] because he said he talks about before
[1:15:45] the tutor and the seal of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:47] comes he said you know here's a young
[1:15:49] man and he's the son of the of the rich
[1:15:51] man and he and now he has an aotment
[1:15:54] because he's the son but Paul says but
[1:15:57] before the holy ghost he differereth
[1:15:59] nothing from a servant though he be lord
[1:16:02] of all he's the son he's actually the
[1:16:06] lord of it all he's going to inherit
[1:16:07] everything he he's going to get a
[1:16:09] signate ring his name on the on the
[1:16:11] contract or the check is as good as his
[1:16:13] dad's. That's what he that's his
[1:16:15] destiny. But before the tutor signs off
[1:16:18] on him, he differs nothing from a
[1:16:20] servant though he is the origin of the
[1:16:23] king.
[1:16:24] And so so now when we come so so he has
[1:16:28] an allotment but nothing has been
[1:16:32] allotted until now we are not only jo
[1:16:35] we're not only heirs of God with no
[1:16:38] allotment but I'm a joint heir with
[1:16:41] Christ which means now I have the
[1:16:43] allotment. Whose allotment? Christ. I
[1:16:46] thought it was his. It is. What's his is
[1:16:49] mine. Hallelujah. He's dipping into
[1:16:51] God's treasure chest and I'm dipping
[1:16:53] into God's treasure chest and he's my
[1:16:55] brother. Yes. See,
[1:16:59] so when we when we when you look at it
[1:17:01] this way, his offspring, though they're
[1:17:04] born in sin and though they're heirs of
[1:17:07] God, though they they have nothing
[1:17:10] allotted, but once they're born again by
[1:17:13] the spirit of God, quickening a gene
[1:17:18] that you were born with, then you're not
[1:17:21] just hes of God, you're joints with
[1:17:23] Christ. And as such, you have rights
[1:17:27] that cannot be taken away. They cannot
[1:17:32] be transferred. They cannot be
[1:17:35] surrendered because they are inherent.
[1:17:39] So my rights, hallelujah, and your
[1:17:41] rights to be in his kingdom can't be
[1:17:44] forfeited even by me.
[1:17:49] I can't forfeit them. I can't sell them.
[1:17:52] I can't get rid of it. The devil can't
[1:17:54] take it. No, there's there I didn't get
[1:17:57] it. God did it. And when he quickens the
[1:17:59] segene of God, I am a joint heir with
[1:18:01] Jesus Christ. I have unalienable rights
[1:18:05] that I don't need anyone's permission to
[1:18:07] be a believer of God's word. I don't
[1:18:10] need the devil's permission. I don't
[1:18:12] need a treaty. I don't need an
[1:18:14] armistice. I'm here to be an enforcer of
[1:18:18] the word of God. Amen.
[1:18:22] They are intrinsic. They are innate.
[1:18:24] They are fundamental. They are built in.
[1:18:28] The dictionary says they are built in
[1:18:32] and cannot be altered. Amen.
[1:18:37] So I could never not be a son of the
[1:18:42] living God.
[1:18:52] God uses
[1:18:55] in your life song.
[1:18:58] He uses life trials
[1:19:01] to train you, to shape you, to mold you.
[1:19:07] Trials do not come
[1:19:11] to weaken your faith.
[1:19:14] Whatever you do, don't let that happen.
[1:19:18] That's not why they came. They came to
[1:19:21] give you the opportunity to get through
[1:19:24] it and build on your faith. Amen. You
[1:19:27] you you want you want you want the the
[1:19:30] fastest way. I've said this for years.
[1:19:32] You want the fastest way to a test, fail
[1:19:34] one.
[1:19:35] And I promise you, you'll take that test
[1:19:38] again and again. And the Holy Spirit
[1:19:40] will see to it that you take it again
[1:19:42] and again until you pass it.
[1:19:46] And it might not be a pleasant test, but
[1:19:48] you're going to pass it. See? And so
[1:19:52] life's trials are part of God's
[1:19:55] training. And what they do at the end of
[1:19:58] the day, and you know this as well as I
[1:20:01] do, they they encourage us to keep going
[1:20:06] forward
[1:20:08] because in the midst of a trial, I can't
[1:20:11] back up. I'm not going back. That's
[1:20:14] worse. All I can do is keep going
[1:20:18] forward. I'm out in the Lord sent me out
[1:20:21] in the middle of a raging river without
[1:20:23] a paddle. Yeah. And there's no way I can
[1:20:27] go back. I'm just going to have to go
[1:20:29] where the water takes me and I'm just
[1:20:31] going to have to trust the Lord. But
[1:20:33] whatever it is, I'm going to face it and
[1:20:36] I'm going to overcome it. And the Lord
[1:20:38] has got this and he's got me and he's
[1:20:40] got you. He's got your life because your
[1:20:43] life is a song. He wants the music to
[1:20:45] play from.
[1:20:46] Amen. So, we go forward even when we and
[1:20:50] let's be honest, we don't always
[1:20:52] understand our circumstances that we get
[1:20:55] ourselves into or that God gets us into.
[1:20:58] Amen.
[1:20:59] But when that happens and here I want to
[1:21:01] come to this last point tonight and I've
[1:21:03] waited to this fourth session to I
[1:21:06] wanted to make this point since I
[1:21:08] preached the very first uh installment.
[1:21:14] We are urged
[1:21:16] when we come into a trial and come into
[1:21:19] a situation we don't understand like
[1:21:21] Abraham
[1:21:23] and he said Lord you came to me in
[1:21:25] Genesis 12
[1:21:27] you came to me in Genesis 13
[1:21:30] and now here you are in Genesis 15 and
[1:21:33] you keep telling me I'm going to be the
[1:21:35] father of nations. You telling me that
[1:21:37] the whole world will be blessed because
[1:21:40] of me. You tell me I'm going to have a
[1:21:42] son. Fact is a son that's nothing. You
[1:21:45] tell me that my offspring and my
[1:21:47] lineage, my heritage will be like the if
[1:21:49] I could if I it'll be like the dust, be
[1:21:51] like the sand. It'll be an innumerable
[1:21:54] amount of people. And I here I am in
[1:21:57] here I am three chapters later, however
[1:21:59] many years transpired. I don't even have
[1:22:02] one son that I can call my own.
[1:22:07] I got a young man in my house. He's a
[1:22:10] fine young man. Most scholars believe
[1:22:13] that you know and and and thankfully
[1:22:15] brother Brandham clarified it to us very
[1:22:17] clearly because the Bible you know
[1:22:19] doesn't make it clear whether this is
[1:22:21] the same Ezer that he later but the
[1:22:24] evidence in the scriptures is is
[1:22:26] convincing and brother Brandon just told
[1:22:28] us very clearly that that it was that
[1:22:30] was Eleazar that went to get Rebecca. So
[1:22:32] he's a fine young man. So I don't want
[1:22:34] to cast shade on Eleazar at any age of
[1:22:38] his life. He's a faithful, loyal servant
[1:22:39] to Abraham. And Abraham calls him that
[1:22:42] and says to the Lord, "This one born in
[1:22:44] my house, he's going to be my heir." And
[1:22:46] God is saying, "That's not. No, you're
[1:22:49] wrong. What did What did my word tell
[1:22:52] you? What did I say when I came? I said
[1:22:56] it would be your seed after your after
[1:23:00] your lineage.
[1:23:02] And it's not going to be this Eleazar. I
[1:23:05] know that. I know he he's a steward of
[1:23:08] your house. You see, friends, can I say
[1:23:11] it this way without casting shade on
[1:23:12] Elizer? I I I've got a promise of God
[1:23:16] that I'm his child, that I've got a
[1:23:18] rapture, and I've got glory and I've got
[1:23:19] heaven. I'm going to be with the king,
[1:23:21] but I got one born in my house.
[1:23:25] And and he's a steward. And he's got an
[1:23:27] awful lot of control over my flesh.
[1:23:31] and and and is this the is I going to
[1:23:33] have to go to heaven with this one born
[1:23:36] in my house? Is this going to be is this
[1:23:39] going to be my inheritance? Is this what
[1:23:41] you talked about? And God said, "No, no,
[1:23:44] no, no, no. This is not going to be your
[1:23:47] inheritance. But the but the seed line
[1:23:50] of Christ, that's going to be your
[1:23:52] inheritance." And I know I have a I know
[1:23:55] I have a man that lives in this flesh
[1:23:56] and he he causes me all kinds of
[1:23:58] problems and he's he's a steward. He's
[1:24:00] got a lot of control over what I do and
[1:24:02] what I think and where I go. And I'm
[1:24:04] constantly having to battle against him.
[1:24:06] But I got another seed that sees another
[1:24:09] reality for me. I got a promise. And so
[1:24:12] God, you know what God does? God takes
[1:24:14] Abraham. Abraham, come outside. Come
[1:24:16] outside, son. Look up.
[1:24:20] Look at them stars. Now, Abraham, and I
[1:24:23] said this to you in the first one,
[1:24:26] if you can tell me the number of those
[1:24:29] stars, I know the number of them.
[1:24:31] I want you to tell me, if you can count
[1:24:34] them, then your argument will have
[1:24:35] validity. But if you can't count them,
[1:24:38] then your your argument doesn't hold
[1:24:40] water. And Abraham is saying, Abra, it
[1:24:44] was obvious Abraham couldn't count them.
[1:24:45] That goes without saying. There's no way
[1:24:47] he could count the stars. But God knew
[1:24:49] the exact number. And I said to you in
[1:24:51] the very first installment that God
[1:24:55] put Abraham,
[1:24:57] God showed Abraham an unreasonable
[1:25:01] question. He presented him with a
[1:25:04] solution that was so unreasonable
[1:25:08] Abraham had no chance to comprehend it.
[1:25:11] He did that. He presented Abraham with
[1:25:13] an unreasonable challenge to stop
[1:25:17] Abraham from reasoning the word.
[1:25:22] I'm going to stop you. All you've been
[1:25:24] doing since Genesis 12 is reasoning the
[1:25:27] word. Let me tell you something,
[1:25:28] friends. God knew long before Genesis
[1:25:32] 12. God knew before Genesis 1:1 that
[1:25:36] there would be a man in the earth named
[1:25:37] Abram. He knew someday he would give him
[1:25:40] a name change. He knew someday he would
[1:25:42] give his wife a name change. He knew
[1:25:43] sometimes long before there was even
[1:25:46] time
[1:25:48] he knew that he would come and use this
[1:25:51] to to to propagate his seed into a great
[1:25:54] glorious kingdom. Amen. And it would be
[1:25:57] a faith seed and there would be no room
[1:26:01] to reason that promise. Abraham, you
[1:26:04] you've got all kinds of mistakes. You've
[1:26:07] made mistakes. You've got flaws. you
[1:26:10] you've been caught lying and cheating
[1:26:12] and conniving and you almost lost your
[1:26:14] wife and and you almost got her killed
[1:26:16] and you almost got killed and you all
[1:26:18] you did it out of fear. You uh troubles
[1:26:20] came in the promised land. A famine come
[1:26:23] and you imagined that I who sent you
[1:26:25] here couldn't take care of you and you
[1:26:27] left and went to Egypt. And brother
[1:26:28] Brandham said, "Anytime a Jew leaves the
[1:26:30] promised land, he is backslid." Amen.
[1:26:33] And not only did he do that once, he did
[1:26:35] it twice. And he's doing the same thing,
[1:26:38] you know, uh because he he's always
[1:26:40] afraid. He's always trying to figure it
[1:26:42] out. He's always trying to reason the
[1:26:43] word of God. Oh, I'm here to tell you
[1:26:45] something, friend. God said, "Look up at
[1:26:47] the stars." Do you know why God had him
[1:26:49] to look at the stars? Because the stars
[1:26:51] was where he wrote his original Bible.
[1:26:55] Hallelujah. And he's reminding Abraham,
[1:26:58] "Look back at the original promise. Stop
[1:27:01] looking right here and this one in your
[1:27:03] house and you're old and Sarah can't do
[1:27:06] this. Start looking at the original
[1:27:08] promise
[1:27:10] cuz it's not going to change. What's
[1:27:12] written there is never going to change.
[1:27:17] See, so he's what is he doing? He's
[1:27:20] referring Abraham back to the original
[1:27:22] word. And that's that's the lesson for
[1:27:23] you and I friends. We don't understand
[1:27:26] the world in its crazy condition. I
[1:27:27] don't understand why it's going. I don't
[1:27:29] understand why we're still here, but I
[1:27:31] know we're still here for a reason. I
[1:27:33] know we're still here for a purpose. And
[1:27:35] I know this word has not changed. I know
[1:27:37] the dead in Christ shall rise. I know I
[1:27:39] shall be changed. I know I shall meet
[1:27:41] him in the air. I know that the kingdoms
[1:27:43] of our Lord shall become the kingdoms of
[1:27:46] of the kingdoms of this world shall
[1:27:47] become the kingdoms of our Lord and his
[1:27:49] Christ. Amen. I know that I that that I
[1:27:55] that there's a number that no man can
[1:27:57] number. And I'm in that number.
[1:28:00] Hallelujah.
[1:28:03] Such an unreasonable situation
[1:28:06] that God placed him in.
[1:28:09] See,
[1:28:11] and Paul said, "He staggered not at the
[1:28:16] promise of God through unbelief, but was
[1:28:20] strong in the faith, giving glory to
[1:28:23] God,
[1:28:25] and being fully persuaded what he had
[1:28:28] promised, he was able also to perform."
[1:28:33] And therefore, and therefore because of
[1:28:36] that failures and all, it was imputed to
[1:28:40] him for righteousness.
[1:28:43] Failures and all, lies, cheat, fear,
[1:28:46] running, conniving, tricking, deceiving,
[1:28:51] failures and all, warts and all.
[1:28:54] He never staggered at the promise and
[1:28:56] therefore it was imputed to him for
[1:28:59] righteousness. Friends,
[1:29:02] you know, we must
[1:29:04] resist
[1:29:06] the natural tendency as fallen mortals,
[1:29:10] fallen humans living in live, this one
[1:29:13] that lives in our house that that causes
[1:29:16] these problems. We must allow, we must
[1:29:20] we must we must resist.
[1:29:23] I I I I I I'm going to coin it like
[1:29:26] this. I hope tonight that and boy, I I
[1:29:30] hope the government doesn't hear this.
[1:29:32] I'd like I'd like for you all to be
[1:29:33] resistance fighters.
[1:29:37] And I'm talking about fighting the
[1:29:39] American government. I'm talking about
[1:29:41] fighting Satan's kingdom
[1:29:44] because we must learn to resist that
[1:29:46] natural tendency to allow the view of
[1:29:50] our circumstances, good or bad, but
[1:29:53] especially the bad. You know th those
[1:29:55] ones that tend to set our faith aside
[1:29:57] and send us down the wonderfully
[1:30:00] fulfilling roll of worry and fear.
[1:30:02] Remember that one? That glorious,
[1:30:05] wonderful, allfulfilling,
[1:30:07] peacegiving fear and worry.
[1:30:11] It sets your faith aside and gets you to
[1:30:13] skip down the, you know, oh, let me just
[1:30:15] go down to worry and fear. Oh, friends,
[1:30:18] resist the lies of the devil. Can we,
[1:30:21] how many want to be resistance fighters
[1:30:23] tonight? Oh, I'm here to tell you, it is
[1:30:26] through your resistance to that. It is
[1:30:29] through your unwavering faith. It is.
[1:30:32] And that's that it's that's how you
[1:30:35] progress. I sometimes you don't feel
[1:30:37] like you're progressing. Just keep
[1:30:39] following your faith. You're
[1:30:41] progressing. Say, "But I got failures."
[1:30:44] But God is imputing righteousness to you
[1:30:46] because you're believing his word.
[1:30:49] Oh my. It's always been about becoming a
[1:30:53] part of something greater than we are.
[1:30:56] That's what it is, friends. That's what
[1:30:59] we're doing here tonight. We're here to
[1:31:02] recognize that we are part of something
[1:31:05] greater than we are. I I I had Sister
[1:31:09] Deb sing that song because I I thought
[1:31:11] to myself, I choose to believe God and
[1:31:15] his many asurances and promises. I
[1:31:18] choose to believe, friends, that that
[1:31:21] the work is finished when he died for me
[1:31:24] at Calvary and rose on the third day and
[1:31:27] ascended back to the right hand and sent
[1:31:30] back his spirit into the church and
[1:31:31] sealed the deal and made a covenant in
[1:31:34] first that God couldn't lie. Oh,
[1:31:35] hallelujah. He can't lie. He can't fail.
[1:31:38] And and he has he has totally sealed the
[1:31:41] deal. Brother Brandham said it a number
[1:31:43] of different ways. I like the way he
[1:31:44] said it uh in the church age series in
[1:31:47] the in the RJC. Uh he said he said God
[1:31:50] God he said he ascended. He laid the
[1:31:53] body on the right hand. God got the
[1:31:55] body. We got the spirit. Hallelujah. And
[1:31:57] then he said and someday it'll join back
[1:32:00] to his spirit in a glorious rapture.
[1:32:03] I'm in that number friends. Oh, stand to
[1:32:06] your feet with me. Hallelujah. How many
[1:32:09] are going to choose with me tonight?
[1:32:10] Say, I'm going to be a resistance
[1:32:12] fighter, Brother Jason. I'm I'm not
[1:32:14] going to keep letting the devil push me
[1:32:16] around. I'm going to be a believer of
[1:32:18] God's word regardless of the
[1:32:20] circumstances.
[1:32:21] Regardless of what Satan tries to pull
[1:32:25] on me, it's just not going to work.
[1:32:27] Amen. That's as far as I dare go this
[1:32:29] evening. Come on and gather around uh
[1:32:32] with me. I think brother Tony uh was
[1:32:34] going to sing some more of that song.
[1:32:35] Brother Andrew, in Jesus name we press
[1:32:37] on. If you just want to begin playing
[1:32:39] that. Amen. Let me get to uh any prayer
[1:32:43] requests. Make sure I don't have any new
[1:32:44] ones. Don't see any.
[1:32:56] Okay. That's not
[1:33:00] okay.

[1:38:21] heard. Lord, you sent it to us from on
[1:38:23] high, and we want to testify tonight. We
[1:38:25] believe it. We don't always understand
[1:38:28] every circumstance and every situation
[1:38:30] we find ourselves in, but Lord, you said
[1:38:32] to Abraham, "Just look up at my original
[1:38:34] word. Yes, it hasn't changed one iota.
[1:38:37] Everything I've said to you, Abraham, is
[1:38:40] already written in the stars.
[1:38:42] Hallelujah. You don't see it, son. But
[1:38:44] just trust that I see it. Lord, may we
[1:38:48] have that confidence tonight. May you
[1:38:50] say to every one of us, son, daughter,
[1:38:52] this situation, you may not see the way
[1:38:55] through it, but don't worry, I see the
[1:38:57] way through. Just follow me. Let your
[1:39:00] life be a a life song of worship and
[1:39:03] praise. Let the whole world hear the
[1:39:06] melody of the gospel played out in your

[1:39:15] your habits, anything that would cause
[1:39:17] the world to hear a off note or a wrong

[1:39:22] world doesn't know the true melody of
[1:39:26] the master unless they see it being
[1:39:29] conducted in the life of your queen.
[1:39:32] So, here we are, Lord. We're it. We are
[1:39:35] to establish the beat and rhythm of the
[1:39:40] melody that you have in your word today.
[1:39:43] If we don't, who will? Who can? We're
[1:39:45] ordained to it, Lord. And I know the
[1:39:49] enemy fights us sore, but Lord, this
[1:39:52] bride alone keeps going forward. And
[1:39:54] tonight, we pledge to you a new, Lord.
[1:39:57] We're going to keep going forward. I
[1:39:59] don't always understand everything. I we
[1:40:02] don't even understand why the world is
[1:40:03] like it is and why we're still here. But
[1:40:05] we know that we're going forward.
[1:40:08] There's no backwards. There's no stop.
[1:40:11] I'm going forward.
[1:40:14] I pray Lord that for those who might be
[1:40:18] two or three of those little girls at

[1:40:36] stumbling and they're out of beat. Lord,
[1:40:38] bring them back into perfect rhythm

[1:40:42] May it be so. We pray for these physical
[1:40:46] needs, Lord. We we ask this need that
[1:40:48] brother Josh turns in. Lord, we need you
[1:40:50] in all things. They need your blessing
[1:40:53] upon these applications. Father, Sister
[1:40:56] Sarah, her family. Lord God, these
[1:40:58] stomach bugs, Lord, the enemy just loves
[1:41:00] to come in, sweep through a family.
[1:41:03] Lord, may it not be so. Tonight, as a
[1:41:06] church, we pray against that devil. I
[1:41:09] pray against you, Satan. I ask, Lord, in
[1:41:12] the name of Jesus Christ, that this
[1:41:14] stomach bug cease and desist and stop
[1:41:16] dead in its tracks, Lord, and leave
[1:41:18] those boys and proceed no further
[1:41:21] through their family. May it be so. Lord
[1:41:23] God, we ask for our sister Deborah who's
[1:41:26] facing, Lord, a medical intervention.
[1:41:29] Lord, that's still you. You're the one
[1:41:31] who gave man the ability to do that.
[1:41:34] These are your choices. We thank you. We
[1:41:36] go to doctors. We praise you for it. We
[1:41:38] thank you for them. Good, honest
[1:41:40] doctors, Lord, who will give you the
[1:41:42] credit that you deserve and give your
[1:41:44] name the honor that it's due. Lord, may
[1:41:47] of all people that give your name honor,
[1:41:49] may it be your bride. Grant it, Lord.
[1:41:51] May our sister's procedure be
[1:41:54] exceptionally blessed above and beyond
