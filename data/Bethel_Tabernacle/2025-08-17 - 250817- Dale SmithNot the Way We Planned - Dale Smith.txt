[Music] [Music] On down that lonesome road to heaven's blessed abode. For many years I was burdened with care. Though often lightning flashed and raging bellows dashed, my sorrow then was so heavy to bear. But since my Jesus came, oh, praise his holy name, he sheds the light of his glorious grace. And every night and day to him I still awake. I found a blessed hiding place. I found a hiding place. A blessed hiding place. I found a hiding place. A blessed hiding place. There's glory in my soul. Hallelu's role. And since my Jesus came, I'm under his control. He keeps me night and day. He answers when I pray and from the raging storm. To him I steal away. I hear no ters knock. I feel no tempest shock. For in the solid rock I found a blessed hiding place. Just like those wondering Jews. I had no place to choose. Each day I had to keep traveling on. But now I found the way that leads to endless day. No more in darkness I wonder alone. When Satan would alarm, I fly to God's strong arm and hide away in his loving embrace. For in the solid rock, the blessed solid rock, I found the blessed hiding place. I found a hiding place. A blessed hiding place. I found a hiding place, a blessed hiding place. There's glory in my soul. Hallelu's role. And since my Jesus came, I'm under his control. He keeps me night and day. He answers when I pray. And from the raging storm, to him I steal away.

So good to see each and every one of you and a lot of familiar faces, a lot of new faces. You brought new ones in and that's all good. New ones born. &gt;&gt; Amen. My the Lord adds to the church daily as such as should be birth. Amen. That's always nice. We want to welcome you and greet you all from the folks out in Flagstaff. We little little church the Lord's given us. And we we've been trying to be very faithful to bring them to the the light of the message as best that we can. And a lot of them are just, you know, just country folks that just they've been in the message a long time and and they've been through a lot. And we can all identify with those things in each other. Amen. And so, uh, but it's kind of, oh, I don't know. We're kind of reared up in the Southwest like that, you know. So, it just it is a real good fit for us. And so, that just the Lord's really blessed us there and given us a a real place. And we just uh appreciate all y'all's prayers and miss you a lot. Amen. We got I got sometimes you you get people that are really familiar, you know, and so you you know, you associate back, you know, the way things were and and I so I call my kids, you know, when you call call your kids, you know, you you call them three or four names, you know, before you get the right one, you know, and and uh my grandkids, it's getting even worse. I I was calling Deborah and and and uh calling Josie. Deborah, Paige, Sarah, what's her name, kid? And I couldn't remember couldn't remember Josie and and I can't remember Paige. And then I can't remember, you know. So, uh Matthew is Matthew, Isaac, Daniel, you know, and so but it's the same thing. I got people out there, you know. I got got a uh some of those geek brothers. I call them Michael and you know they call different ones, you know, that that that you have, you know, so it's always a memory of being back in Bufort, you know, and things like that. And you just you just get to where you miss each other, you know, &gt;&gt; and uh we know that there'll come a time where we there won't be no more goodbyes and and uh we'll all be gathered there at the at the Savior's feet. Amen. What a what a blessed time that that'll be. Amen. We sure do. We always catch the services, you know, when we can. Brother Jason, he'll be I'll be bombing him with Amen Texas and and uh you know, things like that. And and because we're, you know, three hours in the in the summertime, we're three hours uh behind y'all. In the winter time, we're four hours. So, I always get to watch most of the services and things. and and uh I see your faces and I see I I I tell him I said, "Well, I I got to catch the song service so I can uh hear brother Anthony lead the song service, you know, or or uh see my daughter play the piano, you know, I got to try to see him or brother Luther pray for the prayers, you know, pray for the So that's I get a little sneak preview and uh y'all have to stay up late if you want to watch us." And so, but yeah, we just uh bring you greetings from the saints out that way and and uh y'all come see us now here. We appreciate you and and and love you. It was glad to be back in the little country for a day or two and we got to got to do a little fishing in some of my old favorite fishing holes. And so that was nice and uh actually caught a fish or two. So that was real nice. So, we just um want to get get our nerves settled a little bit if it's all right and and we just uh we love you all and and uh you know, we just don't always know what the mind of the Lord is. You know, we we we want to know. We we strive to know the best that we can to find the mind of God to to preach something that's in season and that will be helpful that will help you and to allow you to grow or to give you the the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Amen. Because &gt;&gt; he tells us to earnestly contend. Brother B said if there was ever anything we should contend for is that we should contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints. And so if we can I have a I have a lot of notes. It could go on uh for for a good while. Uh but um uh we we want to just maybe just encourage you in the Lord and just take a little little thought here just for you know few minutes and and then we'll uh turn to the rest of our day. But the most important thing that we can do in life, Amen, is is to hear and act upon the revealed word of the hour. Amen. So we love you and if you would have your uh take your stand to your feet just for a moment and uh we would like to read uh from the book of second kings and we have the um we have the uh the powerpoint there. I'll try not to be too redundant, but uh we want to read from the book of 2 Kings and um there we want to be in the fourth chapter. They get my PowerPoint up and running here. I I had to take to the PowerPoints. I I normally didn't uh never would use those except for if we were doing like Sunday school or something, but um the um when you get with new folks sometimes you you you say something that Brother Bram said and they look at you like, did he say that or you know, we don't know if he said that or not. And so you have to uh so I got to where I was putting everything up and it just became uh just as easy to to Wow, I don't got that good eyes and tell you right now. Uh so we we'll we'll we'll work with it. And so, um, we, uh, we, uh, got where we was real used to reading from the notes and and the folks kind of liked it where they could just follow along, uh, with our thought and, uh, so you're seeing what I'm seeing, so we'll all be on the same page that way. So, you got a title page for me there, Brother Kevin? All right. Well, we're working on it. But if you have your Bibles and would like to go into the book of uh 2 Kings there and chapter 4 and we want to start at verse 10. Amen. Now, just a little background. We have uh this is a story there of Elisha and uh the um the family there that um they built a little little a little room for Elisha to stay in for the man of God. And you remember the story and so uh we pick up there where she's talking to her husband in verse 10 it says let us make a little chamber I pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick and it shall shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thither. And it fell on a day that he came thither that he turned into the chamber and lay there. And he said to Gahazi his servant, "Call the Shounomite." And when he had called her, she stood before him. And he he uh and he said unto him, "Say say now unto her." So he's speaking to Gahazi, "Say now uh unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all um this care. What is to be done for thee? whatst thou be spoken uh for to the king or the captain of the host? And she answered, "I dwell among my own people." And he said, "Well, what then is to be done for her?" And Gahazi answered, "Verily, she hath no child, and her husband is old." Man, we'll just wait there for a moment. Amen. As we call upon the Lord. Father, we just ask you now, Lord, as we have looked into the scripture, Lord. We've we just feel your heart this morning just reaching out to the people Lord as we ask you now to come among us Lord just quieten our spirits Lord and just let us Lord just deliver the burden that's on our heart Lord and and just have your way with us each one for truly Lord we're We're among friends and and Lord, but at the same time, we we the word is not common to us and Lord, but it's it's as it was in the days of Samuel. It's precious. Lord, we just ask you now to minister to our every need as we look to thee in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus. The church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you as you have your seats. continue reading here just for a little bit. It's a bit lengthy. That's why I wanted to just get you seated. And he said, "Call her." And when he had called her, she stood in the in the door. And uh let me see if I can I got to kind of multitask here. Hang on. I get synced up here about this season. Yes. All right. Now, that's we got that going. Now, he said, "And about this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son." And she said, "Nay, my lord, uh, thou man of God, do not lie unto thy handmmaid." And the woman conceived and bare a son at the season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life. When the child was grown, it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the reapers. And so, we kind of have to bring this up to speed a little bit because if we remember many times, brother Brown talks about this uh this child and he calls it a baby. And you know and and uh we realize then that that a lot of times you know that when you're old even though uh the they could be even teenagers they're still little children. And so you never outgrow. So it's relative. You know you get great grandmas and you could be 30 years old and you're still great grandma's baby. &gt;&gt; And uh so you so you have to and they they still spoil you like you were children. And uh so uh but so so we have to when we look at the story we realize that there's been a time lapse from the time that that Elisha gave the promise of the child to come and then about the time of life which is you know about nine months later she has the baby. Well now then the Bible tells us that the child was grown. So now then grown to what level? We don't know but it's still he's able to be called a child &gt;&gt; and he's able to go out with his fathers to the reapers. So then I have to associate with you know about how old was I when I got to go out with my fathers to the reapers or you know to do things with my dad go cut firewood or whatever the case might have been. Uh what how how old was I? So I you know I'm guessing this young fellow was probably you know somewhere between 8 and 12. It's a close guess to me because by the time a child is 12 in those days they were already uh you know at a time where they could start becoming an apprentice. Uh you know if he's still a child then I figure he's you know up old enough to get up and around and I remember being eight or 10 years old and able to you know cut out through the pasture or go gather the bring the cows in or whatever the case might have been. So, I'm guessing around 8 or 10 just so that we can kind of get a visual of about where this uh child was. And it was on a day we went out uh that he went out uh to his father to the reapers. And um it says there that Whoops, went too far. Slow. He says, "And he said unto his father, my head uh my head." And uh he said to the lad to Aad, one of the one of the other workers that was there with him, young fellas that was helping him at the with the reaping of the harvest said, "Carry him to his mother." When he had taken him, he brought him to his mother and he sat on her knees till noon and then he died. He says, "And she went up and laid the laid him in the bed of the man of God and shut the door upon him and went out. And she called unto her husband and said and and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, come again." And he said, "Wherefore wilt thou go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath." And she said, "It shall be well." Amen. &gt;&gt; And that word there in the Hebrew text is shalom. &gt;&gt; And she saddled and asked and said unto her servant, "Drive and go forward. Slack not thy writing for me except I bid thee." So she went and came unto the man of God to the Mount Carmel. And it came to pass when the man of God saw her aar off, he said unto Gahazi his servant, "Behold, yonder is that Shunomite. Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with the child?" And she answered, "It is well." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is shalom. the I we skipped the title page there, but it the title that I that I have is not the way that we planned. Not the way that we planned. And so here we find that there was this this little family. They were they were they were knowledgeable of of Elisha's ministry. They understood that uh this was a man of God. They called him a man of God. And they uh they they wanted to do something that would entertain or that would allow uh this man of God to be comforted and to be uh uh convenienced. there within their home. I thought, wow, what a how would that uh identify how would we be able to identify with these people uh in the day and hour that we live, you know, because it's we understand that it's a book of history, but it's also a a book of application that when we begin to look at the Bible that we realize that those stories, the Bible tells us that they were examples for us. And so then so then if we take upon ourselves the same uh the same mentality the same uh thought that the that this little this the Shunomite woman and how that that she uh that she had it in her heart because it's in you know usually it's in the in the lady's minds of sisters that they're given to hospitality that they the Bible tells us to be given to be hospitable. And so as she understood that this man of God would be passing by from time to time, that she was going to be able to do something in order to entertain this this this man of God so that he would have a place and for his servant and himself to stay and to lodge on their way back and forth uh uh within their uh the the whatever the the daily doings of uh of a prophet of that day, whatever it would be they would they would have a place to lodge. And so this entertaining of this this Elijah and I and I thought my how that that has become the very essence of our uh earthly pilgrimage as far as peoples in the earth today that it's always been in our hearts that there's got to be a way or some way or another that we could uh be entertaining to the message of the hour that there would be something uh about God that we could uh make him feel welcome. Is that right? that the Bible tells us that that we have actually entertained angels unawares and so that there's you know so we always try to treat the man of God the way that we would uh that that we would treat the Lord Jesus if he was to be passing by but not so much in a physical realm or physical person like a uh you know a man of flesh and bone but you know there's a there's a message that that uh that is uh entertained that we actually have an Elijah for this day. And and there's the things that are taught within the framework of the message that we embrace and that we bring into our homes and that we want to that we that we want to lodge there. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. I I want the message of this day to lodge in my home. I want it to be a part of what I do and what I think and and the way that I eat and the way that I sleep and and all these things have got to be something that if it's on if it's in the book, if it's in the if it's on the tape, I want it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want it to be a part of what I do every day of my life. I want if the prophet says it's got to be this way, then I want it to be that way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not interested in uh in, you know, what the neighbors think. I'm not interested in what, you know, they do in the other church or what do they do down the street. I'm only interested in what what does that message say for me? &gt;&gt; How does it apply to me? Because I want to be pleasing in the eyes of God. And so, but there's a there's a there's a benefit to that. There's a benefit when we when we resp have a certain response to the word of God and and Jesus, you know, said, "If you love me, you'll keep my commandments." Is that right? And so then the so the commandment of God is a direct reflection of our love for God. &gt;&gt; I always told the people that if there was ever a time that that there was you wanted to show respects to God. Well uh Abraham showed respects. How did he do that? He paid tithe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He paid tithe. But his tithe wasn't uh uh you know to make some man rich but it was a direct revelation of his understanding of who Melzdc was. that when he saw that this Melzdc was a king of Salem, then he honored the king of Salem. &gt;&gt; Amen. How did he do it? How do you honor a king? By bringing him a gift. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Because you don't you don't get audience with the king without a gift. Oh my. And so it's not a not a gift of our money necessarily, but it's a gift of our yielding to the spirit of God. And so we want to yield ourselves to the program of God. And we want to we want to entertain the message of the hour. So we found that this woman that she in doing this uh uh uh hospitable act to the to the to the uh to the prophet of God that it reciprocated to her that he now says now then what she's been so kind to us. She's done all this for us. She's she's looked after us this way. What is her what can we do for her? Yes. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, he he starts out a little bit superficial there. He said, "Well, I can get you an audience with the king." &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that'd be nice. You know, hey, uh that'd be nice if I could say, "Hey, is there something I can do for you? I'll get you I'll get you a White House visit. You know, you get to go ahead and see Donald Trump." That'd be, you know, I I wouldn't turn it down. &gt;&gt; I' I'd like to talk to the fella. I'd have talked to Joe Biden or any of the rest of them, they wouldn't want to hear what I had to say, but I'd still want to talk to them. And you know, it's like like any of them, Elon Musk or any of the rest of them, I I'd love to tell them about this message. &gt;&gt; You see, because that's that's all I have. That's all I that's all I can do. But then it then so but then Gahazi then and I I want you to see how this thing escalated because now then Gahazi says she's childless and so now then it turns from something that's somewhat superficial and you know doable. All right, you know get to see the king. Well, he could probably have have pulled some strings. He could have got it done. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But now it's going to be a little bit different now because now it's going to be she's childless. Now then there's it's going to it's going to go from the from the plausible and the possible to the impossible to the outrageous. Now then there's it's not going to be something that uh that can be um can be achieved in a natural way. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so then now then it goes on to say uh and so now then she you know so now then he goes and he tells he tells it jahazi tells Elisha she's childless and he says all right so now then he goes and he begins to speak as God &gt;&gt; because he's not speaking as a man because a man can't just say I'm going to give you a child &gt;&gt; here they had already come they were old. They were already stricken in years. They were already at a place beyond childbirth. There was a place now that now then when when when when uh uh Elijah begins to speak or Elisha begins to speak, now he's not speaking as a man, but he's actually speaking like the one that spoke to Abraham. Wow. &gt;&gt; The one that met Abraham, the messenger that met Abraham under the under the tree under the oak in Mamry is actually telling him and his wife who areund and 100 years old and 90 that in a year from now you're going to have a baby. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And so now Elisha is speaking in the same authority with the same authority as the very angel of God. So you think that that that when you see what happened in the day of of Abraham so that they would actually get new bodies that they would actually become back to a time when they could actually uh have children together. &gt;&gt; That there they were. All right. This angel of God, brother Ram tells us that that was Elohim himself veiled in a human body. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? that this is God in a human body speaking to Abraham and they they they conceive and have a baby. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. That same God masked himself in an earthly messenger by the name of Elisha and spoke the same promise. &gt;&gt; The same promise. The same thing happened. But it happened in Oh, can you see what happened in our day? &gt;&gt; Can you see what happened in our day? that God came down and used a human man, amen, to to project to you a message that would literally change your bodies &gt;&gt; that would cause you to conceive and bear Christ the word for your day. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Where are we this morning, friends? We're at a time. Amen. It it it it and we titled our message, it's not the way we planned. &gt;&gt; All right. Because now then this this this spoken word has gone forth. He spoke to her. She said, "Don't you lie to me. This is too serious of a thing. I've gone all my life without a baby. I've wanted one since I was a teenager, but I don't have a baby. I'm an old woman. I can't have children. And now you're telling me, man of God, that I'm going to have a baby." Do not lie to me &gt;&gt; because this is too serious. you're dealing with with emotions that are way too out of out of reach for us to handle. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Don't you worry this time of life. Next year you'll embrace this boy." And it happened. &gt;&gt; And it happened. And no doubt that that that old man was This is amazing. The child of my old age. Here I am. I I've got this I've got a I've got a son. I've always wanted a son. I got a son and and and mother's got the little baby and and you know how it is. You got the baby and all the baby is the centerpiece of the family. It rule rules the house. Huh? A little Miles, he runs the house, you know? I mean, he's he's he's in charge and he doesn't even know it. And and and and so you find that that's the way that it is. And it and and and it it it's it he grows up and then he's 2, three years old and now they get adorable and man you're taking pictures and you know maybe not in those days but you know how it is with little kids and then they and then and then he's getting up. He's getting getting older and now he's he's you're he's learning things. He's getting older. He's five, six years old, you know, he's he's he's really really, you know, starting to get a personality and so forth. And then he's 8, nine, 10 years old. He's a little chip off the old block. He's wants to be with dad all the time. Wants to go with dad. Everywhere dad goes, that's where that boy's right on his heels all the time. And so now it it it it's it's it's the it's the model circumstance. the the the Elijah has gone on about his job. He's comes by, sees the family, loves the little kid, maybe even namesake after him. Who knows? You know, everything is going smooth. Everything, man, they're growing this kid. They're already planning the future for him. They've got, you know, got him in the will. They've got everything's lined out. And then all of a sudden, this boy dies. I mean, we're we we we've looked we're we're we're 10 years in &gt;&gt; and now the boy gets a brother said he probably got a a sunstroke or something like that and he dies. The boy is dead. We didn't plan on this. &gt;&gt; We didn't we we we got here, but how did we get here? We we this is not part of the script. It's not we didn't get no preview on this. We didn't have no we don't know we how did we get here? And so we've all we've all come through something similar to this at some point in our life. We've we've lost loved ones. We've lost we've lost children. We've lost family. We've lost friends. backsliding, left a message, you know, abandoned, whatever you can. The list would go on. It would go on and on because we wouldn't and we don't even we we a lot of the time we can't even explain how we got here. We didn't plan it this way, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; I would have never planned to to to go the the direction that I'm going. you wouldn't have direct you wouldn't you never dreamed that you would get where you are in the condition that you're in. It's ne we it didn't go the way that we planned. And so when when when it when it gets to this place then now then you've got to back up. You've got to call an audible. You've got to you've got to say, "Wait a minute. We've got to we've got to do something different &gt;&gt; because it's not the way we planned. We didn't we didn't plan on going the rest of our life by oursel. We didn't we didn't plan on on on you know uh being rejected by our family. We didn't we didn't we didn't plan on being persecuted by our best friends. We didn't we didn't plan on that. &gt;&gt; And so now how are we going to do it? So now then, do we come to a place now where that we begin to complain, that we begin to question God, that we begin to uh uh uh um doubt the program? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because now we've got to we've got to we've got to make some choices here. &gt;&gt; All right. The Bible tells us in Hebrews, try to catch up with you where I can read some of this. He said in Hebrews chapter 10, the Bible says, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, having a high priest over the house of God. Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, &gt;&gt; having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. This is what he's going to tell us. Now let us hold fast &gt;&gt; the profession of our faith &gt;&gt; without wavering &gt;&gt; for he is faithful that promised. I want to back up and begin reading again from the scripture. It's verse 23. How do we do this? Oh, let me get this up for you here. Yes, right here. So her husband has spoken to her in verse 24. And she saddled ass and said unto the servant, drive and go forward, slack not for writing except I bid thee. And so she came. So she went and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. And it came to pass when the man of God saw her aar off that he said to Gahazi his servant, "Behold, yonder is that Shoemite. Run now, I pray, and meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with the child?" and she answered, "It is well." So, I want to kind of capture the moment that her world has just fallen apart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. her her her life is in shambles right now because brother Bam said that her husband was at home screaming and crying. You know, everything came to a screeching halt. Now she's got to find a reason. There's actually a place where brother Ram said she had to make her way to the man of God to find out why this boy died. Right. Amen. She wasn't necessarily in a place to say come and bring him back to life, but she was she was in a place to go get answers. And that and that was that all that stood out to me that you know sometimes we can't figure out why things are the way that they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we can't change things from what they are. We can't change the circumstances necessarily, but we do have a source to tell us why. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now then, the way that we ask why is what will make the difference as to or not we stay in favor with God. If you'll remember that brother Brown then I think it's in uh uh warning and then judgment. Brother Ram talks about how that there was a a situation that he had prayed for and this girl got well and then it was just a little bit later that she got sick and died. And then brother Brandham goes to God and says, "You owe me an explanation." &gt;&gt; All right? So that's where brother Brandham got in trouble with God because God told him, said he didn't owe him an explanation. God doesn't owe us an explanation. But if we ask God uh the right way, &gt;&gt; then God is happy to give us &gt;&gt; because we approached it in the right way. So we realize in our it's our approach to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He asked the question the the Gahazi asked her, "Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with the child?" And she answered, "It is well." Now if we look then a little further in second Timothy chapter 1, the Bible tells us, "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So that that there's there's a couple parts here that we want to look at. First of all, that that God is the giver. &gt;&gt; All right? He's the he's the father of lights and he's the he's in and every good gift comes from him. Is that right? And so then he tells us here that has not given us the spirit spirit of fear. You notice that's a small s that it's so there is a spirit of fear that comes upon the people &gt;&gt; that didn't come from God. First of all, God does not give that spirit. But he has given us the spirit capital S I and and this is edited. There's the expanded version there. But he ha So the the language there he hasn't given us a spirit of fear but he has given us uh uh the the spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind. And that word sound mind there means a disciplined mind or a temperant mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to look at that just for a little bit. But first of all, I want to back up just a little bit. So, so God hasn't given us fear, but he has given us power. All right. And that word power there is where we get uh dynamite. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. It's it's it's the it's the dunamis power. And of agape. That's literally the word that's used in the Greek text is agape. He has given us power. He has given us dynamite love. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He's given it he so we realize then it's not it's not uh the the so the spirit of power and love and of a sound mind is the spirit of God. All right? It is the spirit of God. It's not a different spirit. It's his spirit. All right? And so this is uh the the the spirit of a disciplined or a temperant mind. I want to look at this word uh sound mind just for a moment. And it's it's uh want you to catch the note here that it is God-given. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Because there's there's you know there's human temperance where you can join aa and not drink. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or do drugs or whatever. That's temperant. That's a form of temperance. But brother Bam tells us that this temperance of the Bible is uh is not that kind of temperance. But this is the from the from the from the Greek text. It refers to the concept of self-discipline or a sound mind. It implies a state of self-control and moderation where one's thoughts and actions are governed by wisdom and prudence. No, then keep this woman, this Sarapheneician woman in your mind. All right? She came to the man of God. She's asked, "How is everything with you? How is everything with the husband? How is everything with the boy?" She didn't go in there and fall apart. &gt;&gt; She didn't go in there and go into an absolute panic and said, "You told us it was going to be this way and that way, and I told you not to lie to me, and you gave me that boy, and now he's dead. What are we going to do about it?" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, he didn't she she didn't panic. Yes, &gt;&gt; but she she how does she approach the situation? How does she now that life has fallen apart? And so that's the that's the message to us this morning. Life has details. Life has calamities. Life has circumstance. But now then, how are we going to deal with it? Because God has given us a source. We have a message. We have a source to draw from that we can say, "Hey, I I don't know. I didn't I didn't plan on getting here. I didn't plan on things being like this, but now that it's like this, how do I deal with this? I'm not going to blame God. I'm not going to question God, but I'm going to come with self-control. I'm going to come with moderation. I'm going to have my thoughts and my actions. They're going to be governed by wisdom and prudence." In the New Testament, it's used to describe the mental and spiritual discipline that enables a believer to live a life &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; that's not appeasing to God, but pleasing to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a difference. We don't just try to satisfy God's program by a list of dos and don'ts, checklists, pluses and minuses, and ABCD. No, but we want to be pleasing to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so this this this this Bible temperance, this Bible uh this this this sound mind that that Timothy was telling Paul was telling Timothy that look, you've got to come to this and it's a life that's pleasing to God characterized by restraint and thoughtful decisionmaking. She had a donkey ride. I don't know how many of you ever rode on a donkey, but it ain't fun. There is not one minute on a donkey's back that you will enjoy. I promise. I've been there, done that, got the sore tail from it. I mean, they got withers that are like this and oh, there's just horrible. It's not like a big old fat quarter horse. I mean, and so ain't nothing good about a donkey ride. And she said, "Don't hold up until I tell you." And so she had rode that bouncy little beast of burden all the way to the man of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And remember, brother M tells us that that thing that Rebecca rode on that old camel, he said that was the vehicle, he said that was a type of the Holy Ghost message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when she rode on that camel all those miles all the way back to Isaac, when the when the woman of the south, she had to ride that camel all the way to the wisdom of Solomon. That was the vehicle that took her there. It was a type of the Holy Ghost. And this Holy Ghost was bringing this woman from her circumstance to the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you stay with that Holy Ghost, no matter how bumpy the road gets, &gt;&gt; Amen. it'll get you there. &gt;&gt; Thoughtfulness. Amen. So, brother Bam tells us that Bible temperance, this is direct from the stature of a perfect man. Brother Bam tells us that Bible temperance is how to answer back in kindness. And I added there because I was thinking of Hadty Wright. I was thinking of the Woods brothers. I was thinking of the different ones that that where the spoken word operated in Brother Bram's life. It was because somebody said the right thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so that's true Bible temperance. So here was this woman. She comes into the presence of of the word of for her day. She comes into the presence of the Elijah for her day and she says the right thing. Shalom. Amen. The word shalom speaks of peace. It is it is actually part of the one of the redemptive names of Jehovah is Jehovah Shalom and that's with Gideon when he built an altar and God tells him that his peace will be with Gideon and so Gideon builds an altar and at that altar he names that altar Jehovah Shalom. So when you so we realize and the Bible tells us that he is our peace &gt;&gt; and he has broken down that middle wall and that middle wall is actually the the wall of uh of aggression that was there between the Jew and the Gentile. It was a it was a it was a wall of adversity. And so that wall has come down. It also speaks of the veil. So that veil wall that has come down that was that was that created a a an adversity between God and man because the Bible tells us that we were immnity with God. &gt;&gt; But then that wall came down at Christ when the veil was rent and the mercy seat was come in plain view. Then that wall of adversity came down. So now then uh so he is our peace. So he is our shalom. And so we realize then that he has given us a spirit, his spirit, which is the spirit of shalom. It's the spirit of rest. It's a spirit of peace. It's a spirit of uh of welcome. It's a spirit of good morning. Hallelujah. It's that spirit that's a welcoming spirit. And so he's given us that spirit. So, if that's the kind of spirit that we have when we're when we're faced with abs adversity, when we're faced with trials, when we're faced with with, you know, uh uh breakups, breakdowns, you know, all these kind of different things, when we're faced with those things, then we have this approach to God and it's shalom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We say, "Father, shalom." &gt;&gt; And he asks us, "How is it with you today?" When God comes to ask you, "Hey, you're sick this morning. you're you're you're afflicted. You've got this problem. You've got that problem. There's things going wrong. The world's not treating you right. You know, the job is failed. The the the the bank account is empty. The bill collectors are coming. The cars broke down. We got all these kind of problems. We're sick. We're in the hospital. We're going to a funeral. We got all these kind of things. And God asked you the question this morning. How you doing? &gt;&gt; What's your answer? &gt;&gt; What's your answer? &gt;&gt; Come on. Shalom Lord. &gt;&gt; You are my peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Now then, shalom is the opposite of this. The the the the the sound mind, the temperant mind, the the shalom spirit that God has given us is the opposite of consternation. Conststerernnation is the feeling of anxiety or dismay, typically at something unexpected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a verb that means to fill someone with anxiety. Comes from the Latin word terrified, prostrated. It's where when when when when life falls apart and you can't do nothing but lay on your face. &gt;&gt; When you can't do anything but go back to bed and cover your head with a pillow and and and and say, "Surely it's going to be better in the morning." And then tomorrow comes and it's not any better. whenever whenever when when when when life just keeps dealing you uh you know uh uh lemons as it were. So this is this is this the spirit of consternation. And if there was ever a woman, ever a family that was faced with the possibilities of constrnation was this little family in our text that here they had they, you know, and the Lord knows we've all faced similar situations and we could just start naming them off, &gt;&gt; but we're just using them as our as our as our uh as our topical in index this morning. that here was this family. They had raised a child to eight or 10 years old. This was a promised child that was given to them by God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through the spoken word, through the message of the hour, this was everything that they had ever dreamed of. And now it had it had come to pieces. And so now then here's this family. And if there was ever anybody that was experienced in the moment of consternation because that's what would been natural. &gt;&gt; The natural feeling was to be able to pull your hair and sit down and cry your eyes out and call on God and question God and wonder and question yourself, question your own experience. How many times have you questioned your own experience? Yeah. &gt;&gt; When things fell apart and you begin to wonder, "Oh, God, I failed you some way. Surely this could not have happened to somebody that was right with God." &gt;&gt; And the devil is sit right there. &gt;&gt; Remember, hey, don't don't think you're exempt, but there was a prophet that came to the same place. Wife was dead, baby was dying. Devil came, sat on the edge of the bed, and told him, he said, he said, "It's not because God isn't real. is that God don't love you. &gt;&gt; And so now then now then you now it's consternation now because of things that weren't expected. Things are going totally the opposite of where they we thought they would have gone and they're not going the right way. And so now then I have to start questioning myself. There's something that was unexpected here. Now I'm filled with anxiety. Now I'm in this terrified wondering if I'm even saved. I'm probably serpent seed. &gt;&gt; Come on. There's no use in going on. I don't need to go back to church. I might as well just lay out, lay down, give up, throw in the towel, surrender, &gt;&gt; and the devil's going right there. Just like the brother said in Sunday school this morning. You're sitting on the fence. The devil don't have to even worry about it no more. &gt;&gt; You're fixing to fall into his lap anyways. But no, right now is when you got to you got to go back and say, "But God gave me &gt;&gt; the spirit of a sound mind." &gt;&gt; And that sound mind says, I'm going to make spiritual decision making in the in the hour of my worst trial. &gt;&gt; When my worst trial comes, I'm going to make right decisions. I'm not going to choose my own way. I'm not going to think my own thoughts. I'm going back and I'm going to let the word make my thought for me. I'm going to let the message of the hour make my decision for me because I know I can't make my own choice. I know that right now in the condition that my mind is in. I will blow this thing. I will I will miserably fail. But I know the word works. &gt;&gt; It works every time, every place, under any circumstance. I'm holding on to the message of this day. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, we're 30 minutes in. We're going We're doing good. Listen to this. A Christian's faith has to have a solid resting place. You know that. And the only say only. only &gt;&gt; only better say it louder only &gt;&gt; resting place that a Christian a true true true not some makebelieve not some halfway halfbaked Christian I'm talking about true Christianity &gt;&gt; a true bornag again &gt;&gt; not halfborn &gt;&gt; not part born but real born &gt;&gt; like Holy Ghost born &gt;&gt; huh Yeah. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghostborn Christian can rest his or her faith is upon the unmovable word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It isn't built upon the shifting sands of men's theology, doctrines, church affiliation, but true believer, his faith rest solidly, unshifting as he approaches the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know the word is right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I know I'm not always right. &gt;&gt; I am most of the time right, &gt;&gt; but then I was just mistaken. If I was anything but right, but &gt;&gt; I know this the word is always right. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know why that's blacked out. Oh, yeah. There we go. So the Christian faith is based solidly solidly upon rest. Tell you a little story. Most of you know brother brother Dwayne Lawson. Wayney called him brother Wayne Lawson. Super good guy. Dear dear friend. We were back back in Shirley Bay. We was on a boat. We was back in there fishing. And this is Arkansas. So, anything that's in the woods back there will bite you or suck blood out of you. All right. So, it's it's rough back in there. Mosquitoes or the state bird, that kind of thing. I mean, they they they're just big nasty mosquitoes and we're back in Shirley Bay and we're getting eat up, but there's the potential of big bass in there. And so, if there's a big bass somewhere, I'm going to be looking for it. And so and and brother Wayne and I were back there and we had the boat and we were and so we we fish a a bait. It's called a buzz bait. It's I'm speaking in tongues most of you. But at any rate this this buzz bait is a top water. It sits up it's up on the top of the water and you throw it in and then when you pull it has a little propeller on it. And we we never have figured out why fish like it because it doesn't have it's doesn't reflect anything that you would ever see in the wild. And so we call it airplane food. You don't know what it is, but you eat it anyway. And so, so we throw that buzz bait back up under them trees and we pull it back out and and then all of a sudden these big bass they come up and they just blow up on it and it's oh it's just it's exciting and it's fun and it's it's it's a lot of fun. But those buzz baits don't come cheap. And you know, they're, you know, four, five, six dollars a piece. And so, you know, if you get one stuck on a limb or something back up underneath them trees, you know, you do everything in your power to go get the thing loose so you can keep your bait. So, he threw back up underneath this tree and he got under there and it hooked up on a on a on a root ball and he couldn't get it loose. And so, he said, "Back me under there and get me. Let me get my bait." And so, I backed him up under there. When he got back there, he got down to his bait to get it loose. Well, about that time, he stirred up a big old river wasp. And in Arkansas boy, they call them waspers. And so this big old wasper come out of there and it hit him on the back of the neck and one on the back of the arm. And he started squealing cuz they're big old giant wasp like that. And he started squealing and said, "Get me out of here. Get me out of here." And so he got his bait and I got him out of there and we got out and he was just just hurting for certain. And uh so you know he just you know stung him twice real bad and and it was just starting to swell already and it was just terrible. And just something came over me and I just went down laid hands on him. I said, "Brother Wayne," I said, "Brother Bam tells us the secret to the supernatural is to relax or rest." And I said, "Just relax. Take a deep breath. We're going to pray." And I prayed for him and we went on fishing. It went away like that, instantaneous. And by the time we got home, he had a little tiny little black dot where he got bit. But you know, anybody that knows about those things, you spend days suffering with those things. And brother B tells us, he says that Christian faith is based solidly upon rest. So now what is it? It's our it's our approach. It's our attitude towards the promise of God. Are we going to come in there screaming and howling and ftting and worrying? &gt;&gt; Or are we going to just say, "Well, that let's just rest. Let's just relax. Let's take a deep breath. Think about this for a moment. What would what would Jesus do?" Huh? A Christian is not tossed about. A Christian doesn't run from place to place. &gt;&gt; People have to think about those things sometimes. You know, I I I learned this a long time that geography doesn't change your trials. &gt;&gt; Will not change. You can think, well, I can come here, I can go there, I can do this, I can do that. It will not change &gt;&gt; who you are. You'll still carry who you are wherever you go. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whatever you meet, you're still the same person. Oh my. So, we don't we don't we don't use geography as an excuse. &gt;&gt; Not to say that we can't move or go do things that we want to do or move to a better place or whatever. That's that or get under a different ministry. That's totally a different thing. The the situation deals with you. What are you going to do about you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. How are we going to are we going to uh we're going to have that spirit of a sound mind? Christian doesn't fuss and fume. That's good language. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, we don't we don't fuss and fume. We don't we don't and and and it's a day and hour where everybody else is at fault. &gt;&gt; You ever notice that? You just find that that nobody is at a place to be responsible for their own actions. That their own actions are the cause of mom or dad or preacher or circumstance or COVID for crying out loud. COVID caused more problems than he caused overweight and everything. A Christian doesn't fuss and fume and find excuses and blame other people. Look inward. What brother Bam tells us the zeal of the hour was is to say I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; Um repent therefore I'm wrong. So the zeal of the hour is to look inward. It's all it's all over. It's all finished for the believer where at Calvary. Years I spent in vanity and pride, caring not that my Lord was crucified. Oh my. Oh my. But it's all finished at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I was supposed to be clicking here and I'm looking down here. See, I had it all here for you. Are you reading fast? Okay, let's move on. That's right. Oh, sickness may come, disappointments, but the Christian is at rest knowing this that God is able. Is God able this morning? &gt;&gt; God's able to fix whatever is wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. And make it right to keep that which he hath performed. The Christian rests in that hope upon the stormy sea. Sure. I like how he says this. Sure, storms rise, all kinds of trouble, but we're anchored in Jesus. The storms of life all brave. That right. But we're anchored. That's all. It It will It'll never sink. It can't sink. Can't sink. It's unsinkable. This is not the Titanic. Hallelujah. The Titanic didn't even make it the first trip and it was at the bottom of the sea. &gt;&gt; Oh no, this has got a much much higher captain. Amen. I I I've told this story here no doubt years ago. Tell it again just on my mind. There was a ship. It was c making transatlantic uh crossing. They got uh out in the middle of the Atlantic was back in the days of sailing ships. And in this in the in the days of sailing ships, they didn't have, you know, weather channel. They didn't have, you know, uh, uh, satellite and all this other kind of things to tell them what the weather was going to be. They just had to go and hope for the best. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they got out across this in the middle of the ocean there. And, uh, there was many times that they would get, uh, uh, these, uh, hurricanes like they have now in the Atlantic. Well, if you run into that thing while you're out there, sometimes it's going same direction you are. And you're going to have to ride this storm for days. Many times it was weeks on the open sea. Horrible, horrible. Many times the ships didn't survive it. Many times most of the crew and most of the passengers and a lot of the merchandise that they were hauling didn't make it. When they would make it back to shore, it was just a just a just a shell of what left. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, in this particular uh uh uh journey, they were crossing over the sea and they knew they were coming up on a on a on a on a terrible storm. And so the captain, he tells all the uh passengers to go below decks. They batten down the hatches. They seal the hatches so that the underneath part of the uh ship doesn't get water in it and the upper decks will be able to shed the water and it'll it'll it'll ride the waves and so forth. They pull down this the mass or the sails and they, you know, they just keep the keel in the right direction and hope for the best. So, the captain tells them to go down in the bottom of the ship. Stay down there and uh uh don't come out until I come and get you, basically. And so, they went down into the bottom of the ship and they're waiting and the storm gets worse and worse and it goes on for days, literally days. And you can't imagine what the bottom of a ship looks like after days of people being sick and and and and it just gets worse and worse and it just it's just a horrible horrible place to be in the ship. It's almost as bad as being down there as it is out facing the storm. But finally, there was one of the one of the men said, "We we don't even know if the captain is still alive. We don't even know if he if we can even we don't even know. We don't know what's what's what are we facing here. So his days in the bottom of the ship. So finally one of the goes against the captain's orders and he goes and he opens the hatch and he crawls out onto the deck and he looks and he sees that the captain has tied himself physically tied himself to the helm of the ship. And he's laying there on the helm of the ship holding the ship on course. and he looks up and the captain catches his eye and sees that the captain's still alive. And so he goes and he shuts the hatch and he goes back down and he says, they ask him, "Well, how is it?" He goes, "It is well." And they said, "What did the captain say?" He said, "He didn't say anything." He said, "But he smiled. It's going to be okay. &gt;&gt; We've looked and we saw the face of the captain. We've seen the face of the captain. &gt;&gt; He smiled. It's going to be okay. We've got a We We've seen the smile in the word. &gt;&gt; He said, "It's finished. &gt;&gt; It's a He said, "It's finished." He said, "My peace I leave with you." Not like the world leaves. I leave you shalom. Amen. &gt;&gt; I leave you rest. I leave you peace. I leave you good morning. It's going to be all right. It's going to be okay. Amen. Praise the Lord. It'll never sink. It can't sink. &gt;&gt; Find a place to close here. He says, "Now you have two different mental faculties." Did you know that? Actually, there's three. At least I know I have three. One's in my mind, one's in my soul, one's in my stomach. I think with my stomach, I can be controlled. Josie made some cinnamon rolls the other day that were out of this world. She could lead me around by the nose with one of those things. Yeah, Paige made some some brownie or muffins the other day. Oh my goodness, these young girls learn how to cook. My be hard to keep them single this rate. He says you have you have one of them that's in your head by your brain. The other one is operated in your heart which is called your soul, your spirit and your soul. Now I just made these in bullet points so that we could just kind of see the process of his thought here. He says they are very much in disagreement many times. So you're many times our mind will think one thing and so we look let's look at our Shunomite just for a moment that there's no doubt she's looking at this corpse of her baby and her mind is telling her that she's been betrayed. She's been lied to. This is too much. I can't bear this. This is this is this is awful. Uh this is irreversible. This is unchangeable. This is final. But there's something else begin to speak. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When that other thing began to speak, he said, "When the head seems to say something and the soul wanders at it if it's not right, but when it comes into the soul, the head seems to step back." &gt;&gt; And what does she say? "Husband, saddle me the ass. I've got to go see the man of God." He said, "But it's not new moon or Sabbath." She said, "It's all right. Peace. It is well." I love this quote. He said, "There's been things that's happened to you that you knew was going to be, yet you couldn't explain it." &gt;&gt; I just sometimes you just know it. &gt;&gt; You can't explain why. And there's no reason you couldn't explain it out, but yet it just you just accepted it. It happened just that way. That's when something happens down here. Sometimes the soul just says, "It's going to be that way. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to argue about it. I'm I just know it's going to be that way. It's going to happen. I'm not I'm not not in a place to explain it. I just know that something is going to happen. Something good is about to happen. &gt;&gt; Something good is on the way. Hallelujah. Oh my. That's how she could just say it is well. &gt;&gt; It is well with my soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When sorrows like sea billows roll, I know it is well. &gt;&gt; He said, what do you have to do? Faith cometh by hearing, hearing by the word. Watch. Here's your here's your here's your pattern. Now follow this. He said, "And believing and applying and resting." &gt;&gt; That that that that's the ticket to getting in the spirit. It's in it's it's it's what brother Ram called believing from the heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; He said you first you believe by hearing the word of God. You apply what he said in the word of God, not your own thought. You don't reason it out. You apply what the word says and then relax. &gt;&gt; Rest. Amen. Shalom. All right. I love this thought. He says, "You cease from being an alien. Now you are a child." Look at this list. from death to life. You're a child of God. You you you don't the Bible the Bible tells us that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you'll never come into condemnation. You never come into the second death but you move from death unto life. He says from darkness into day. &gt;&gt; All right. From mortal into immortal. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Is that what Paul preached? &gt;&gt; So that was a resurrection. That's what the seed does. If the natural seed does that, so does the spiritual seed. We're experiencing spiritual resurrection even this morning. &gt;&gt; We're living in spiritual resurrection. One place, brother, several places. Brother B said, you're already resurrected. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He uses the word glor from uh from you whom he did justify, he did sanctify. I mean did sanctify he did also glorify and so now then we're we're in a glorified story state from corruption to incorruption. All right. Now then these bodies are very corruptible. We see that every time we look in the mirror. &gt;&gt; Is that right? It's getting it's getting closer and closer. But what we realize then but there's something the immortal soul down on the inside is incorruptible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. From weary into joy, from and resting fully upon thus saith the Lord. Now then, we'll try to jump out here. He says to the Samaran church, listen to this. The key to this age is most evidently tribulation. So that was a second church age. &gt;&gt; All right. If there was tribulation in the first age, there is now predicted, listen to this language, an intensified tribulation throughout the second age. Doesn't stop there. There's no doubt but what what uh the following words of Paul which we'll read here in a moment applied to the mass of Christians wherever they were in the world and in every age. So if there is an intensified from if the first church age had persecution and had tribulation, the second one had a prophesied intensified tribulation and then that was also going to be intensified. Remember uh the the scale on hurricanes, you know how that works. Or the scale on earthquakes, you know how that works. You know when they say it's a cat, you know, one, everybody's, oh, just a little tropical storm, you know, it's going to be okay. will shelter in place. You know, chap, you know, two, some of the people leave the some of the people stay, you know, a cat three. Well, now it's jumping up to 140 plus miles an hour. There's going to be power outages. There's going to be this, that, and the other. The only ones that are going to stay are first responders and brave people. Huh? you get to a cap four, cap five, man, get out of here. Only I mean, not even the slightest chance of sticking around for that thing. You It's It's going to be bad news. You're going to have 30 foot tidal surges and all this other kind of stuff. It's time to get out of here. Same thing with an earthquake. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, it's just a you know, it's a two or three on the RTOR seal, but you know that it's up by 10 every time they add one of those numbers to that, &gt;&gt; you know. So, it it's intensified. So, so is it with in the natural. So is it in the supernatural, with the spiritual that as the ages progressed, &gt;&gt; what we're experiencing today with AI, multimedia, and and and internet and all this other kind of stuff, it what they had back in the days of John Wesley, come on friends, that was child's play compared to what we got today when it comes to sin and temptation. And so we're dealing with an intensified tribulation in the age that we're in now. Now then he's actually referring to the scripture here where Paul uh tells to to the Hebrews he said uh but call to remembrance the former's days in which after you were illuminated you endured a great fight of afflictions partly uh whilst you were made a gazing stock both by reproaches and affliction and partly whilst you became companions of them that were so used. So whenever you if if brother Brandham took persecution for the doctrines that he taught in the day that he was here, how much more the church of the living God that is believing the things that he taught? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we've embraced these things. We've made a we've made a a place for the man of God to live in our homes. And we got his picture on the wall. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I got his picture on the wall, friends. I'm I'm I'm supporting this thing. &gt;&gt; All right. He said, "For you had compassion on me and my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance." &gt;&gt; Now then, the Lord God Almighty says, "I know." There he is. I love this. So when Jesus says, "I know," and he's actually referring back to uh uh Revelations chapter 2. He says, "I know your tribulations." All right. Now, he said, "When the Lord God Almighty says, "I know." There he is walking in the midst of the people. There, there he is, the chief shepherd of the flock. But does he hold back the persecution? Question mark. Does he stem the tribulation? No, he does not. He simply just says, "I know." &gt;&gt; That that that should be enough. &gt;&gt; That should be enough to for him to say, "I know." ought to answer every question that we got. But we we still wrestle with it. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; I know your tribulation. I am not at all unmindful of your suffering. What a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel. They wonder if God really loves them. How can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer? &gt;&gt; Remember what brother's answer was to that question? It's the tender hand of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; You see, they could not figure out God's love. They thought that love meant no suffering. They thought that love meant a baby with parental care. But God said that his love was elective love. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The proof of his love is election. That no matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth. He goes on as our musicians come. We're we're going to wrap this up. Uh he says, "Unless we suffer with him, we cannot reign with him." &gt;&gt; You have to suffer to reign. The reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering. Character is a victory, not a gift. A man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic. &gt;&gt; But power with character is fit to rule. And so we've read this over and over, but many times we we we need to keep reading because he says, "And since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcome and has sat down with his father with his father's throne, then we have to overcome to visit to sit with him." And the little Are you reading it? Yep. The little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared with the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes. &gt;&gt; Oh, what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into the kingdom through much tribulation. So then we realize it didn't go the way we planned, but it did go the way he said. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said it would come. He said, "I know. I know you're going to suffer. I know you're going to have tribulation. I know you're going to you're going to experience all kinds of calamity in life. You're going to experience a lot of things that you cannot understand. There's going to be like one old song says that tears are going to run down your cheeks unbidden because of life and the passing of friends and loved ones. And it's it's going to happen. We're mortals and we're that means we have a we have an appointment, &gt;&gt; you know, and and if the Lord carries, we'll see others go by way of the grave. We'll have we'll have, you know, but at the same time, there'll be new ones born. There'll be there'll be friends that will experience salvation. There'll be life given. It'll be there'll be glorious times of baptism and the the wonders of the Holy Ghost dealing with people's lives. You'll see those things &gt;&gt; and it's all part of living. &gt;&gt; But now then what about what about the attitude that we'll take &gt;&gt; in the process? Will we face God with questions and and accusations towards God? Or will we will we be able to go with a sound mind and with a temperate heart and make Bible choices and Bible decisions. Oh, that I might have been back there in the first age when the apostles were first sent out. There's no need to look back. Look up. Behold, whom is now walking in the midst of the churches through all ages. Behold him who is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And who never changes either in essence. Amen. The word essence speaks of perfume, speaks of it speaks of characteristic. You know, you you you smell that that that that sweet rose of Sharon. That's his essence. That's who he is. Amen. So he does it it never changes either in who he is or the way he behaves. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. So therefore, God our father, his character and his works prove who he is. Amen. Can't read that one. Says his works cannot fail. His character cannot fail. And his works declare his character. So he has arisen today and he's here in our midst. The same yesterday, today, and forever. And we're witnesses. Are we witnesses of his character? He doesn't change, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad for it. I know what I can expect. Amen. &gt;&gt; Things don't go the way I planned, but they always go the way he planned. Nothing catches God offguard. &gt;&gt; Nothing surprises my Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, he'll let things surprise me because brother Bram said that's the way you are with your wife. He said that's the way he is with his wife. He likes to surprise you. His character has I love this. Brother Bam says his character has changed me. When it came to me, I was once a sinner. Now I'm saved. I once was lost and now I'm found. I once loved the things of the world. I hate it now. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; My the Bible says if you love the world or the things of the world, the love of the father is not even in you. So where? So do some inventory this morning. Do you love worldly fashion? Do you love the way the world is? Do you love Do you want to look like the world, act like the world, dress like the world? Is that is that in you? &gt;&gt; Oh my. His character is not in you. If you do, Amen. You're you're you got to have his if you have his character, you will hate the way the world looks, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You'll hate its fashion. You'll hate its its behavior, its talk, its ways. You'll hate everything about it. The prophet did. &gt;&gt; I hate it now. I once cared not for God. I love him now. Something happened to me. Something happened to you. What is it? It's God's work declaring his character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Whoops. Got a little too excited. This is a This is quoted to try to get people to come to church. I'll just quote it to get people to come to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you can come to church every day of your life and go straight to hell. &gt;&gt; But if you ever come to God, if you ever gather with the saints, if you ever gather where the saints gather, that's in Christ. Listen what he says. Where two or three are gathered together in his name, there he is in their midst. And not only in their midst as a complacent onlooker &gt;&gt; or as a recording angel, but there he stands expressing exactly what he is, the life and the sustainer and giver of all good gifts to the church. And the woman said, "It is well." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Elisha said, "Let's go." So they went to the house and you know everybody said he was dead until until Elohim came in the house. When Elohim came in the house, death had to flee. He couldn't he couldn't death couldn't stay because she took the right attitude. She she was temperant. She took the right she had the right heart, the right spirit. She didn't accuse God falsely. She She had that same spirit like Job had when when the Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I didn't ask for this. Where were you, Job? When the sons of God shouted and the morning stars sang together, "Where were you, Job? Can you reply against a God that laid the foundations of the world?" Are you are you in a place to to question my majesty? Are you in a place to question my decision concerning you? Because I know my thoughts concerning you. &gt;&gt; They're of good and not of evil to bring you to an expected end. You've got to be childrained if you're going to make it. Every son of God must come by the way, amen, of the switch. &gt;&gt; That's the program of God. It's not the way you planned it. It's not the way that you would have expected it. But I'm here to tell you, it's God's way. And his way is always the best way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll go his way. Even if it's contrary to my way, if it's I'll think his thoughts because they're always better than my thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say, "Oh, God, help us. &gt;&gt; Help us." Amen. That is our our earnest prayer as we stand this morning. Hope I didn't keep you too long. [Music] Maybe we'll just bow our hearts for a moment. Heavenly Father, we're just for just a moment, Lord, just to reflect [Music] We all everyone have individual and several trials that we go through and are facing in life. And Lord, we're not here to question your will, but if we could come and and just ask the reasons why, we know that maybe you would give us a little comfort today. Paul said that he had learned to be content in whatever state that he found himself in. And so, Lord, we're we're here to be content this morning. We're here to be satisfied, Lord, that you are your Jehovah Shalom this morning. And so, Father, we we we ask you to send peace, to send grace, to send love, send power and love and a sound mind, Lord, into the hearts of your children that we could in this onward generation make decisions based upon the message of the day that we've received, Lord. that you'll take us into your care and into your cover of your wings, Lord, this morning, Lord. Shelter us, Lord, in the cliff of the rock. We pray, Lord. Cover us with your mind and with your with your sweet Holy Ghost. Lord, we pray, Lord, that we could that we could be stable, unmovable, unsinkable. For Lord, we have looked at the face of the captain and he smiled and we know all is well. All is well. We love you, Lord. And we ask your grace upon us, Lord, upon this congregation, Lord, that you would help them to grow in grace and and in your love, Lord. Add to them daily such as should be saved, Lord. We pray for our loved ones and our friends, Lord, that you would raise them up, every single one. That you would give us our children and our children's children under the third and fourth generation, Lord. That there would be a great Holy Ghost reunion, Lord, among the redeemed of all the ages, Lord. Lord, may there be a a special place at the table so that we may sit together, Lord, in your kingdom that is to come. We pray. We truly love these folks and ask your richest blessings upon them. That all sufficient name of the Lord Jesus, we pray. [Music] [Music] Faithful forever. You will be faithful. You are. [Music] All your promises are yes and amen. Oh, let's worship him a little faithful. &gt;&gt; Tell him he's faithful. &gt;&gt; Raise up those hands and sing it to Jesus. Faithful, Lord. &gt;&gt; Faithful. &gt;&gt; Faithful. Faithful. &gt;&gt; Forever. You will be faithful. You are all your promises. All your promises are yes and amen. Beautiful Savior, you have brought me near. You pulled me from the ashes. &gt;&gt; Broken every broken every blessed redeemer. Blessed redeemer you have saved. &gt;&gt; Oh my. What a testimony. You set this captive free. How about you today? Free. &gt;&gt; Lord I &gt;&gt; Lord I &gt;&gt; Oh my [Music] faithful. You are faithful Lord. Faithful. Faithful [Music] forever you will. I'm so glad you are. All your promises, Lord, all your promises are yes and amen. Faithful, faithful [Music] you are. Isn't that wonderful? [Music] Forever you are Lord. Faithful you are &gt;&gt; like a testimony now. All your promises &gt;&gt; All your promises are yes and amen. &gt;&gt; All your promises All your promises are yes and amen. All your promises All your promises are yes and amen. Hallelujah. I believe him like that. Don't you? You know, I I was thinking how brother brother Dale just crafted that so beautifully. I felt I felt this whole day I felt so instructed. Started with our Sunday school class and &gt;&gt; I was telling brother Brad how that meant so much to me the way he brought that thought in for the Sunday school from so many different angles. And then brother Dale, we were sitting in the back talking about some of this stuff. I didn't know you were about to bring all of that to the pull pit. Mike, that was wonderful. I have I have feel benefited today, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many feel benefited today by being in the presence of God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and to be instructed. You know, I I think about that Shunomite and you know, she she's looking to Elisha like God, like brother Dale said, you know, not a man could give you that kind of word. This time next year, you'll embrace a child. And so, and the Bible teaches that Moses, remember, he said to Moses, I'll make you a god and I'll make Aaron your prophet. and he gets him before Pharaoh and the Bible says he made he made Moses a god to Pharaoh. Remember that? &gt;&gt; Later on he stood in the gap for Israel. Later on he said the Lord your God will raise up a prophet like me. See so it's not unusual Elisha had given her that word. And I just thought about that, brother Dale, and I thought, you know, today she goes to Elijah, Elisha, to have him intervene on her desperate situation. Sometimes we can get in desperate situations. You know something? You have the same right to go to the same God, to believe the same word, and say, "Lord, intervene on my behalf." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the Lord could have just as easily declined. He could have turned her down. He chose to bring the child back to her. You know, and that's why I I I thought how fitting it was, you know, when Job is brother Dale finished up there with Job and God's answer to Job is so poignant to me. Has been for years. And God is just saying, Job, listen, listen. I I know my thoughts about you. They're for good, not evil. I know this doesn't look good for you. It's not what you planned, but I know what I'm doing. Just trust in me. How many will trust in him? &gt;&gt; And to say, "Lord, you can intervene." You see, it's all about and it to me, it wasn't as much about God deciding, you know, she's going to Elisha to intervene. It's not to me as much as God deciding to grant it or not grant it. It's that she went with shalom. &gt;&gt; Say she went to ex She was going to accept whatever God said. She had already accepted. &gt;&gt; Whatever she already had made up her mind is all well. All is well. &gt;&gt; She didn't know whether God would do it, but all was well regardless. He's faithful, friends. You like serving a God like that? Do you like knowing that you have the same promises and you can go to the same God? Just be sure you go with shalom in your heart. Say, "Lord, you know your thoughts about me. You know what you're doing. It's not what I planned, but I'm all for what you planned." I have prayed that so many times. Lord, don't give me what I want. Give me what I need. &gt;&gt; Faithful. Let's sing it, Brother Tony. Faithful before we go. Amen. &gt;&gt; Faithful &gt;&gt; you are. &gt;&gt; You are &gt;&gt; all my like a testimony now. &gt;&gt; Faithful. &gt;&gt; You should be able to sing with all your heart. If you really trust him, &gt;&gt; faithful you are. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Yes. All your promises are yes and a &gt;&gt; faithful. Faithful. Faithful [Music] you are. Yes. Faithful.
