[0:00] now is when the true worshipers shall
[0:02] worship the father in spirit and in
[0:06] truth for the father seeketh such to
[0:09] worship him in the days of Jesus of
[0:16] Nazareth when he was here owner walking
[0:21] in flesh he found the people in his day
[0:29] seeking a religion that would bring them
[0:33] delivery's they wanted a religion that
[0:38] would deliver them from all their evils
[0:41] and their enemies and Christianity met
[0:49] every challenge that they asked for
[0:54] Christianity met everything that they
[0:58] needed and everything that they asked
[1:00] for it challenged every one of their
[1:04] needs
[1:06] one by one they would not receive it and
[1:11] it's about the same as it is today we
[1:31] let's pray let's stand up and pray
[1:33] actually gracious father we come to you
[1:38] now Lord and we ask that your Holy
[1:39] Spirit would move amongst us today
[1:41] father that you would speak to our
[1:44] hearts and deal with us Lord let the
[1:45] word penetrate deep within us and
[1:48] produce the results Lord that you've
[1:51] sent it for father we thank you for that
[1:53] we ask that your name would be lifted up
[1:56] and glorified amongst us we ask it in
[1:59] Jesus name Amen
[2:00] god bless you you can be seated I'm
[2:03] gonna continue on part three of
[2:05] obedience is better than sacrifice as
[2:09] you can see on the screen kind of this
[2:12] is the item where we're going today
[2:13] faith innately grows works love innately
[2:19] grows obedience a perfect bride innately
[2:24] grows a perfected bride amen
[2:30] God is working mightily in this day to
[2:36] accomplish that in the earth amen
[2:42] there's a poem that my father-in-law
[2:47] brother Don Hoffman from back to my
[2:50] pastor back in when I was back in
[2:52] Minnesota would read often and I feel
[2:55] like it's very fitting for the subject
[2:59] we're talking about and kind of the
[3:01] direction I'm wanting to go today and
[3:03] further down the road it's by it's
[3:06] called the shaping of a disciple by owed
[3:10] it by Dale Martin stone when God wants
[3:14] to drill a man and thrill a man and
[3:18] skill a man when God wants to mold a man
[3:22] to play the noblest part when he yearns
[3:26] with all his heart to build so great and
[3:29] bold a man that all the world shall be
[3:32] amazed
[3:33] then watch God's methods watch his ways
[3:37] how ruthlessly he perfects whom he
[3:41] royally elects how he hammers
[3:45] and hurts him and with mighty blows
[3:48] converts him making shapes and forms
[3:51] which only God Himself can understand
[3:55] even while his man is crying lifting
[3:58] abbacy Ching hand yet God bends but
[4:01] never breaks when man's good he
[4:04] undertakes when he uses whom he chooses
[4:07] and with every purpose fuses man to act
[4:10] an act to man as it was when he began
[4:14] when God tries his splendour out man
[4:17] will know what he's about that's
[4:21] beautiful you know that's that's God's
[4:24] dealings with us he has promised that
[4:28] he's going to have a perfect bride and
[4:30] we have faith in that word and so that
[4:35] process is going to begin by our faith
[4:38] in that word he says you're perfect and
[4:41] then he says but you need to be
[4:44] perfected and say okay well what does
[4:48] that even mean you're perfect in God's
[4:51] eyes the blood renders us perfect and
[4:55] then when that blood is applied you know
[4:58] in a true work of justification bride
[5:02] justification the next result is God B
[5:05] starts working has to that's that's how
[5:08] the new birth works if there's not that
[5:12] working that that ruthlessly perfecting
[5:18] whom he royally elects you know God gets
[5:21] us in his hand and he he hammers us and
[5:27] you say well he hurts us that's what the
[5:29] poem said he's trying he's trying to
[5:33] reflect his image through us and so he
[5:36] has to beat out the dross you it needs
[5:40] to be twenty-four karat gold is he's not
[5:41] looking for 18 karat twelve eight that's
[5:46] that's too impure he wants 24 karat and
[5:50] then next is suffering his trials he
[5:55] hammers us he pounds away at us
[5:58] so that we are perfected in his eyes
[6:01] Hebrews 10 verse 14 this is from the ESV
[6:10] version the one we have up there because
[6:13] I want to bring out something in the
[6:15] lattice Peschel II in the last part but
[6:17] it's a perfect expression of what we're
[6:19] just talking about for by a single
[6:22] offering he has perfected for all time
[6:27] those who are being sanctified so we
[6:32] have both sides there he's perfected us
[6:34] by the blood we're in in God's sight we
[6:39] are perfect in other words the judge has
[6:42] made his judgment
[6:43] we're already judged in Christ you've
[6:46] passed from death to life but that's not
[6:49] it
[6:50] when you've passed from death to life we
[6:53] see there's a result which is being
[6:56] sanctified now that we're not talking
[6:58] about foolish virgin can be justified
[7:01] without being sanctified you can be
[7:02] sanctified without we're not talking
[7:04] about that we're talking about the bride
[7:05] and that's that's something different we
[7:08] can go through the processes but the
[7:10] result of justification is what
[7:13] sanctification and baptism and the Holy
[7:15] Ghost we have the Holy Ghost inside and
[7:18] now all work begins
[7:21] perfectly expressing brother branham's
[7:25] message look at verses 15 16 and 17
[7:33] there as well where of the Holy Ghost
[7:37] also is a witness to us for after that
[7:40] he had said before this is the Covenant
[7:42] that I will make with them after those
[7:44] days saith the Lord I will put my laws
[7:47] into their hearts and in their minds
[7:49] while I write them in their sins and
[7:51] iniquities will I remember no more so we
[7:56] again see both sides God looks at us and
[7:59] says I don't even remember your sins
[8:02] you're perfect you're sinless your
[8:05] spotless your the virtuous Bride of
[8:07] Christ and he also says that he's
[8:11] writing
[8:12] his law his word in our hearts so those
[8:17] who have this judicial decision put upon
[8:22] them by the blood of Christ that they're
[8:24] sinless in God's eyes
[8:26] the result is by the Holy Ghost he
[8:28] writes his word within us what is the
[8:31] message doing in this day it declares us
[8:35] perfect doesn't it but then it says well
[8:38] you've got a process to go through
[8:41] you're not you're not there yet
[8:43] you need your do you have growing to do
[8:46] I need to write this word that's been
[8:48] delivered that you believe in and that
[8:50] through that you're saved but I need to
[8:53] write it needs to be written on your
[8:54] heart so that you reflect me so that no
[8:58] man teaches his neighbor nobody says
[8:59] brother Charlie you got to be obedient
[9:01] and well that's what we're preaching on
[9:03] you got to be obedient but the reality
[9:06] is the Holy Ghost is already writing
[9:07] that on your heart already convicting
[9:10] you and the preaching of the word just
[9:12] increases increases that whole project
[9:15] because it's the washing of water by the
[9:17] word the Holy Ghost in you feeding on
[9:21] the word transforming you to make you
[9:24] the image of Jesus Christ a few quotes
[9:31] here from things that are to be I like
[9:37] to call it rapture part two it's a
[9:41] perfect place calling you to that
[9:44] perfection and you have to be perfect to
[9:47] get there the Bible said so jesus said
[9:49] be therefore perfect even as your father
[9:52] in heaven is perfect it's a perfect
[9:55] Kingdom so it must be a perfect people
[9:57] come because you have to stand and be
[10:00] married to a perfect son of God and you
[10:02] must be a perfect bride so how can you
[10:07] do it any through anything else but the
[10:09] perfect Word of God which is the waters
[10:11] of separation that washes us from our
[10:14] sins amen that's right the blood of
[10:16] Jesus Christ think of it the dripping
[10:18] bloody word amen the blood the Word of
[10:25] God bleed
[10:25] blood to wash the bride in a man yes sir
[10:29] she stands perfect virgin unadulterated
[10:32] she never sinned in the first place
[10:34] amen she was trapped into it see so
[10:39] there's again both sides of the coin
[10:41] right and right in the same one we
[10:44] believe it he's declared as perfect and
[10:46] yet there's a work to do we need to be
[10:49] perfected from the sermon perfect faith
[10:55] not a faith but a perfect faith build it
[11:00] up in here and watch a perfect God with
[11:03] a perfect heart keep a perfect promise
[11:06] by His perfect word which is sharper
[11:09] than a two-edged sword and indiscernible
[11:11] of the heart what we're coming now to
[11:15] the perfection because the people has to
[11:18] come to this in order for the rapture
[11:20] that's what's holding it away right now
[11:23] is waiting for that church to come into
[11:27] that perfect raptured faith hmm
[11:31] looking for it it means a lot of shaving
[11:34] down for me it means a lot for you but
[11:37] together we'll make it by the grace of
[11:39] God amen so part of this process of
[11:42] rapturing faith is shaving down it's a
[11:47] cleansing you know brother Jason has
[11:50] expressed it wonderfully God had a
[11:52] purpose in the first age and that was to
[11:54] have a perfect bride with a rapturing
[11:56] faith but they fell away when the time
[11:59] came they fell away now it has to be
[12:01] restored this was God's intention all
[12:04] along when he brought the new covenant
[12:06] what was his intention to declare us
[12:10] perfect yes through the blood of Jesus
[12:13] Christ and to write the word on our
[12:15] hearts so that all we are is the word
[12:18] all that's made visible is the word and
[12:20] when that comes to place we go up and so
[12:24] why are we here today
[12:26] well what did brother Branham say that's
[12:30] what's holding it away right now holding
[12:32] Waterway the rapture that's what's
[12:35] holding it away right now is waiting for
[12:36] the church to come into that perfect
[12:39] raptured faith so in order to get there
[12:43] what does he say it means a lot of
[12:45] shaving down whoo
[12:49] lord help us that's what we want we want
[12:51] shaving down we want to be in that place
[12:54] where we can have a perfect raptured
[12:58] faith strange way to say it
[13:01] not a rapture ring a finished a perfect
[13:05] raptured faith and so what is it growing
[13:09] to that if you're not growing into that
[13:12] Oh check your birth you got to get the
[13:17] Holy Ghost because when you have the
[13:20] Holy Ghost in this age its leading you
[13:23] in this process
[13:24] to what perfect raptured faith and in
[13:28] the meantime your shape its but you're
[13:30] being shaved down God is correcting you
[13:32] God is rusyn ruthlessly perfecting whom
[13:36] he royally elects Philippians 2 12 and
[13:46] 13 I don't know if any of you have heard
[13:48] of the Wiest translation but it's a
[13:51] Greek New Testament expanded translation
[13:54] and sometimes it's not the greatest but
[13:56] sometimes it really does a tremendous
[13:59] job of illustrating to me the message of
[14:02] the hour so this is Philippians 2 12 and
[14:06] 13 wherefore my beloved ones as you
[14:10] always obeyed not as in my presence only
[14:13] but now much more in my absence isn't
[14:17] that wonderful that the Apostle saying
[14:19] you you're oh but you obeyed when I was
[14:21] there but I know you're obeying even
[14:23] more now that I'm gone why because it's
[14:25] the Holy Ghost working in you perfecting
[14:28] you changing you transforming you but
[14:30] now much more in my absence carry to its
[14:34] ultimate conclusion your own salvation
[14:38] with the wholesome serious caution and
[14:42] trembling now it says in the King James
[14:46] Version it says work out your salvation
[14:49] with fear and trembling that word
[14:52] work out is speaking like of a math
[14:56] problem so when you're working out a
[14:59] math problem there's a conclusion that
[15:01] it's coming to but there's a process of
[15:03] getting there so we we look at and say
[15:06] work out your salvation me oh man I got
[15:08] to work hard and I've got to do this and
[15:09] this and this and this in order to reach
[15:12] salvation it's not what it's saying
[15:13] saying carry your salvation to its
[15:16] ultimate conclusion as a math problem
[15:19] you're saved but there's a process that
[15:23] you go through to get to that end
[15:25] salvation and you won't get there unless
[15:28] you go through the process you can't say
[15:31] well I'm saved and that's the end of it
[15:33] I'm done that's what the whole
[15:35] denominational world is saying and
[15:37] they're missing the whole reality of the
[15:40] simple scripture if you're ultimately
[15:43] saved it means you're going through a
[15:45] process that God is shaving you down
[15:49] he's working he's care you you are a
[15:53] participant in it because Paul says that
[15:56] we must carry it to its ultimate
[15:58] conclusion so does that mean now that
[16:04] we're you know we're the ones that bring
[16:07] our salvation no let's keep looking and
[16:12] it says do it with fear and trembling in
[16:14] the KJV but here he's saying serious
[16:19] caution and trembling so that that's
[16:23] really tremendous when you think about
[16:24] how do we live our lives how do we walk
[16:27] with God there should be some serious
[16:30] caution and trembling along with it we
[16:34] don't just go along say hey everything's
[16:35] fine and no problem and hey I'm a
[16:37] Christian I all is just joy and
[16:39] happiness there's joy and happiness by
[16:43] all means I think that's what God
[16:45] ultimately made it for but within that
[16:48] to have joy in God an ultimate pleasure
[16:52] in God there needs to be some serious
[16:55] caution and trembling why because we
[16:58] know ourselves we know our weaknesses we
[17:02] know the points that we fail yes we
[17:05] still fail
[17:06] yes we still sin and it should cause
[17:10] serious caution and trembling why for or
[17:16] because God is the one who is constantly
[17:21] putting forth his energy in you I love
[17:25] that God is constantly putting not just
[17:28] sometimes not just at church not on
[17:31] Wednesday night God this is for the
[17:33] elect no God is constantly putting forth
[17:37] his energy his power his glory his life
[17:42] in you
[17:45] now what was what are we talking about
[17:48] were carrying our salvation to its
[17:50] ultimate conclusion why do we do it
[17:53] because God is putting his energy in you
[17:56] to do what both in the form of you being
[18:01] desirous of Wow and of your doing his
[18:06] good pleasure
[18:07] so how has God's energy expressed in you
[18:12] your desire your desire to carry your
[18:17] salvation to its ultimate conclusion and
[18:20] doing his good pleasure so that's it
[18:23] we're carrying our salvation to its
[18:26] ultimate conclusion because God is
[18:28] constantly putting his energy into us
[18:33] isn't that beautiful it's not you
[18:37] working yourself into salvation it's you
[18:41] being studious of your life studious of
[18:44] your choices
[18:45] praying feeding on the word being sure
[18:50] that you're in the faith being sure that
[18:52] you're standing right being sure that
[18:56] you're following in obedience to the
[18:59] word step-by-step why do you do that
[19:02] though why do you have that desire in
[19:06] yourself because God's constantly
[19:09] putting his energy in you if God isn't
[19:14] know let's go to the negative if God
[19:16] isn't putting his energy in you then
[19:19] what
[19:21] you won't work out your salvation with
[19:24] fear and you won't carry your salvation
[19:27] to its ultimate conclusion because God
[19:30] is hidden you the Spirit of God is in
[19:32] you you are carrying your salvation out
[19:35] to its ultimate conclusion John 8:31 and
[19:43] 32 then said Jesus to those Jews which
[19:51] believed on him if if that means that
[19:58] there's two sides to this if you do this
[20:03] this results if you don't do this this
[20:06] results so there's an if if you continue
[20:12] in my word then are you my disciples
[20:15] indeed and you shall know the truth and
[20:18] the truth shall make you free so a
[20:21] condition of being a disciple of Jesus
[20:24] is continuing in the word what if you
[20:28] just say I believe and that's the end of
[20:29] it and there's no work in your life
[20:30] there's no fruit there's no conformity
[20:34] to the word you're not continuing in the
[20:37] word and you're not the disciple of
[20:39] Jesus but when you continue in the word
[20:42] it's not just attending church and
[20:45] saying you're a message believer but
[20:48] it's it's abiding in staying and living
[20:53] in the word then you're the disciple of
[20:56] Jesus so we need to continue in the word
[21:01] if we don't jesus has tough words for us
[21:07] you're not my disciple we want to
[21:11] continue in that word Martin Luther says
[21:17] this thus it is just as impossible to
[21:22] separate faith and works as it is to
[21:25] separate heat and light from fire they
[21:32] want the one results from
[21:34] the other always comes forth this is
[21:38] from works as faith expressed trying to
[21:42] get this from multiple angles so you can
[21:45] see the reality of it notice Jesus said
[21:49] only believe for all things are possible
[21:50] to them that believe faith and works are
[21:53] husband and wife they work together the
[21:56] husband works with the wife the wife
[21:58] works with the husband they identify one
[22:02] another like a man says he's married and
[22:07] yet he can't produce and show that he
[22:08] has a wife you doubt his claim see a man
[22:11] said I'm married where's your wife oh I
[22:13] don't know about that
[22:14] see see be kind of hard thing for me to
[22:17] believe in I say well where is your wife
[22:19] well I don't know I'm going to believe
[22:22] it so you see if you have what you say
[22:24] you have I have faith how are you gonna
[22:27] show me you got faith by your work see
[22:31] I'm married how do you know you're
[22:32] married this is my wife see there you
[22:36] are so you know it's it's totally
[22:41] connected to each other faith is what
[22:46] saves us the Holy Ghost baptism within
[22:50] us is what brings the life but it
[22:54] produces something faith being alone
[22:58] without works it's dead it's it's dead
[23:04] faith it's not genuine faith because the
[23:06] devil's believe also and tremble true
[23:09] and genuine faith always results in
[23:12] works now when we hear faith and works
[23:15] you know we go back to some traditional
[23:18] way of thinking and think what works is
[23:20] you know giving to the poor and doing
[23:22] this that's part of it absolutely in
[23:26] other words I all go up to it this way
[23:29] Paul talks about the fruit of the Spirit
[23:32] so you have the spirit in your life you
[23:35] say I've received the Holy Ghost
[23:37] now something results in that there's a
[23:40] fruit there's a result there's something
[23:42] there's a bearing there's a bearing of
[23:46] wheat and see
[23:47] and so forth when you have the Holy
[23:51] Ghost when you have a life inside of you
[23:53] there's something that's produced as a
[23:56] result and so if there's not something
[23:58] that's produced there's something out of
[24:01] order and we got to get it right
[24:07] Romans 6:17 and I'll quickly close with
[24:11] this much more to cover but do that next
[24:14] time but God be thanked that you were
[24:17] the servants of sin but you hope have
[24:20] obeyed from the heart that form of
[24:22] doctrine which was delivered you obeyed
[24:26] is a very interesting word in the Greek
[24:30] it's the word means to hear under as a
[24:37] subordinate that is to listen
[24:38] attentively by implication to heed or
[24:42] conformed to a command or authority
[24:45] remember brother Branham talks about he
[24:48] that Jesus said he that hears my word
[24:50] and believes on him that sent me has
[24:53] eternal life and his past as far as
[24:55] passed from death to life he says any
[24:58] drunkard can hear the word any prostrate
[25:01] prostitute can hear the word it's not
[25:03] just that the word the word hearing in
[25:06] the Greek speaks of hearing in hearing
[25:09] under so what does that mean think about
[25:11] it for a second
[25:12] tissue it's to listen and then to come
[25:16] in submission to the word that's being
[25:18] smoke spoken so they've obeyed from the
[25:22] heart they heard and come under that
[25:25] word from the heart they've the Paul
[25:30] says the form of doctor in the form of
[25:33] teaching which was delivered to you
[25:36] another translation says which you were
[25:39] delivered unto in other words God has
[25:42] delivered you to this message not that
