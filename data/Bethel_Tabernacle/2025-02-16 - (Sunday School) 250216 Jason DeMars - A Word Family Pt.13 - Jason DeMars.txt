TRANSCRIPT
========================================
1 Timothy 3:4 and5 speaking of an uh overseer and that's uh overseeing the local church says one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of God let's Pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your word. I pray that this light and this reality, Lord, would come into our hearts, Lord, and would change us and transform us, Lord. That our minds and our hearts would be not conformed to the ways of this world, but would be transformed, Lord, as our as our minds are renewed, Lord, that we would see things through your eyes and through your heart, and we would be changed into the image of Jesus Christ. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. God bless. You can be seated. So looking at um the ministry um I think many times over the years people look at and see is this person uh gifted to speak? Is he anointed to be able to deal with us? And that's wonderful. But uh scripture never makes how well someone speaks as the qualifications for ministry. And unfortunately, we live, you know, in America where family and everything is divorced from church life, even public life in many ways. And you can you can be a mess and still be a great leader. Uh but really you're not a great leader if if your life is not in order. The scripture makes it clear. If if your life and your family is not in order, how then can you rule or lead the house of God? Amen. And I I think this is a critical point to be made and to be understood. Um, you know, I there's there's we speak a lot about the five-fold ministry, and we look at the gifting that God uses men for, and you could say, well, you know, c some of these ministries, it would be okay if they were not married or if their f family was this or that. But the more I examine it and look at it, I I just can't see any ministry in the body of Christ that would be truly effective if the man is not leading his family well. Now, that doesn't mean there's not problems. We all know we our own selves are full of problems and difficulties and trials, but it's someone that's applying himself and that is getting good results of the Lord moving in his family. It's like saying, "Oh, the man can't lead his children to Christ, so how is he going to lead the people in the church to Christ?" Right? This is this is something that's critical. And I think the way Paul is showing us is that leadership in the in the local church must be done by someone who is leading his own house. Well, you know, we can look at that and see clearly from scripture the the the nature and the attributes. Now in the message basically the only qualification becomes well is your wife uh was your wife a virgin when you were married. This becomes the only qualification when it actually looks more at what is your behavior now? How are you leading your family now? This is the critical portion and the critical part. You know, I look at it. You could say, "Well, what about missionaries and what about this?" It all goes together. If your if your family is in disarray, stop your ministry and go home and that realize that's where your ministry starts because if your ministry isn't getting good results at home, I it's probably not getting the results that it's supposed to get at the church. And I think if if I I believe if we looked at it as believers this way and I would say say it this way, demand more and as ministers demand more of ourselves first. Um this is our first ministry and the pl first place we should be looking for results. Christianity in the world today is full of people that are so focused on their ministry or their life's work, not realizing that your life's work in your legacy is your family. And this is the place where we want to have the first results because we'll eat the fruit of the results that we get. You know, there's there the stories throughout the Christian world are replete in our day and age of men who are great speakers, great orators, and they have no clue how to lead and take care of their families. Well, scripturally, scripturally, you have to say that if they can't lead their families, they should not be in a leadership position in the local church. No matter how gifted a speaker, no matter how anointed or excited people get when he speaks, it's it's more about what are what is the fruit of the ministry. In other words, what kind of lives are his family living? What kind of lives are the people under his care living? Amen. That this scripture connects those two things together and leaves them hand in hand. doesn't mean the man's perfect. It doesn't mean his children are required to be perfect. It does mean though that he is putting all his efforts and and passion into leading his family first and then in turn leading his home. And if if we would if believers would look at that more closely and see that more closely, I think we would have um better, more wellestablished ministers leading us and preaching to us. Might not be a popular s thing to say, but we didn't sign up to be popular. Well, some people might have, but they should get to the altar real quick because if we're preaching to be popular and to get likes and attend, preside over, to be a protector or guardian to give aid to to care for give attention to. So a dis a preacher who's disconnected from his family is disqualified from the ministry. Let's just be blunt about it. Let's just be straight about it. If you're not paying attention to it, if you're not being a protector, not a guardian, you're not superintending, you're not leading them, you're not first teaching them, then you're disqualifying yourself from the ministry. 1 Peter 5:1 and2, "The elders who are among you, I exhort, I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed. Shepherd the flock of God, which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion, but willingly, not for in dishonest gain, but eagerly." So here Peter writing to them is is expounding on what the work of someone who's ordained to be a shepherd or an overseer of the church. And it's the purpose is if we look at another translation it's to feed the flock of God. So the oversight that's taken is feeding them. So as fathers then we understand that it's our duty to spiritually feed our families. Many times we look at it as well we just get them to church. We make sure they're fed and clothed. But actually your duty is to be a teacher of your family. If you for if you forgot the scriptures that we covered about four different times, it's Ephesians 6:4. We're supposed to to admonish to raise our children in the in the in the admonition and the correction of the Lord. And this is this is our duty. Too often we see it our our well, let's just put it this way. Our the culture around us takes us and causes us to put these our our duties onto someone else. And we don't examine that it's actually our own duty. We come and say the church isn't doing this. The church isn't providing this. The pastor should preach more about this. The pastor should do about that. And forget that you are the pastor of your own flock. You are the shepherd of your family. And you can't put all the responsibility onto someone else to do what God has called you to do. And so part of that is spiritually feeding your family. You say, "My family isn't getting enough this. They need this. Why isn't the preacher preaching about this? You the the Holy Spirit has caused you to notice something that's needed." Now get on your knees and get in your Bible and start studying and start seeking after God. And you bring it to your family what they have need of. You say, "I I can't. I you can if you do this daily. Really, it should be daily that you're feeding your family. Not once in every not when it's emergency. We don't wait till an emergency. We don't wait till everybody's starving to feed them dinner. We just do it regularly. And so that same thing goes with spiritually feeding our families as fathers. You know, we mention it in passing. You're the high priest of your home. Well, seems pretty consuming to me. Seems like it's something that should be like a focus for fathers, not a side thing. Well, we go to church and I send them to school and we do homeschooling at home and my wife does this and is that where we're at? We're putting our own responsibility on to other people instead of being men and taking responsibility for what our duty and what our job is. We we have to feed the flock that's in front of us that God has given us the oversight. And if we do a good job of that, you're gifted at doing that, then you qualify to feed and rule over the church of God. But if you don't do that and you neglect that, then you're neglecting your primary duty. The the the the great deception of the modern church is that a man's first and primary calling is outside of his home. Not realizing that it's his own wife and children. Amen. That's the first duty and calling. Yes, there's many things that need to be done outside the home, but that's not first place. That's comes after the fam. God first, family second, everything else after that. Church doesn't come before family. Sorry, you might disagree with me. You might want to slap me upside the head, but family, you have to put feeding your own family ahead of the church. Amen. 1 Thessalonians 2:10, Paul speaking about his attribute as a father to the people that he was uh leading to Christ. He says, "You are witnesses and God also how holy and justly and unblamably unblamably we behaved ourselves among you that believe. as you you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father doth his children. So fathers do you exhort and comfort and charge your children? Paul says this is uh a main attribute that fathers are supposed to have in their life is to exhort your children, comfort them. The word charged speaks of uh being a witness. It's literally the word martyr. So it's being a witness. So testifying to them of what God has done in your life, witnessing to them of the gospel. This is a primary duty of fathers. Amen. The first people that the children should hear the gospel from, it's not in church. It's from mom and dad. Amen. And as we need to hear the gospel every single day, probably 20 times a day personally, we should be doing the same thing for our own family. First Samuel 3. Old Eli, he was a godly man, but poor old Eli didn't discharge fully his duty as a father. Amen. And the Lord said to Samuel, "Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone that heareth it shall tingle. In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house. When I begin, I will also make an end. For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knoweth, because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice, nor offering forever. So what did Eli was a godly man. He was a godly high priest. He loved the people and he performed his ministry well. But he missed something. And that's when his sons did evil. He refused to correct them. He refused to do what he was supposed to do as a father. What should what could he have done? His sons were doing this. Well, number one is kick them out of the ministry. Amen. you guys are disqualified. You're behaving like thieves and perverts. You can no longer do the ministry. But he refused to do that. Even in the situation where he gets this prophecy from Samuel, did he take them out of the ministry? Did he do anything? He said, "Well, that's what the Lord wants to do. It's fine." What a shame. Amen. What a reproach. What a milk toast. He might have been ever so strong in his mental beliefs, but when when it came down to doing what he had to do with his sons, number one is why did they get so far along that they thought that they could behave like this? If their father was involved and raising them the way he was supposed to, they would have been getting a good dose of correction for their misbehavior when they were little. Amen. And this would have brought a change to them. But instead it brought God he refused to restrain them and it brought God's wrath upon his house. And really if you if you understand it is that's what that's what many times happen is you refuse to do your duty as a father and it brings God's judgment and displeasure upon your family and then you reap what you have sown for what it for what has happened and it's heartbreaking and it's difficult and yet we know that God is a redeemer. God is gracious. Even when we fail, even when we make mistakes, you know, don't do as Eli and just say, "Well, so be it. It's too late now." Which is just going to happen. When when God reveals something to you, does it matter when it is? You first correct yourself, then then bring it to your family. You say, "It's too late." No, not with God. So correct yourself and then bring your apology for your failure to your family. I've had to do it myself. Amen. It's necess it's absolutely necessary. Don't don't just say, "Well, it is what it is. Nothing we can do now." It's not true. You have you have prayer and you have words that you can speak. And those words, if they're the word of God, if they're the oracles of God, they're powerful to bring a change and transformation. Proverbs 22 verse 6, train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart depart from it. Obviously, this is verse everybody's heard over and over and over again, but it it it goes again. How do I do that? You take the word of God that God is showing you and you show it to your family. Just as Abraham, as we talked about last time, just like just like Abraham, should I hide from Abraham the thing that I'm about to do to Sodom and Gomorrah, seeing I can't do it, seeing that he will command his family after him to know the Lord and to do justice. And so because Abraham was a man of God that was going to instruct his family, God revealed the secrets to him. So start teaching your family what God has shown you and more is coming. God will reveal more and more and more to you to bring to your family. Don't leave it as my kids just man they just don't know the message very well. Okay. Well, look in the mirror. It's because of you. Sorry to be I apologize for being so blunt this morning, but I'm talking to myself as well. And as I said before, it's not too late. You say, "Oh, it's too late. They're this age." Well, if you feel that way, so be it. But maybe God can use you even now. Maybe God can work through you even now. I believe he can. And so, but the critical thing is if you don't have kids yet, pay attention to this this verse. Or if you have little babies, pay attention to this verse. Start immediately. Fathers, if you're if or husbands or soon to be husbands, um, understand, lead your home right away. Don't even wait till you have children. Lead your wife in worship. Teach your wife. It should be a wellestablished thing that's happening in your home so that when kids enter enter into it, they're infants and it's happening and it's just all they know. What a glorious thing. Start that immediately. And of course, we know that there's exceptions. This is a proverb. It's not an absolute that you train up the child in the way they should go. When they're old, they will not depart from it. Sometimes they do depart from it and sometimes they depart from it permanently. But the general principle is this is if you do train them up in the good and right ways of God with love and with correction and with all the balance of the word of God, then when they're old, it's quite difficult to depart from such a good and lovely and beautiful way. Right? That's the point that it's going to make. with difficulty. Many kids, young people can leave leave the ways that they've been trained in. It's it's a fact. But it's not easy. Amen. It's not easy to do it. Proverbs 13:24. He that spareth his rod hateth his son, but he that loveth him chastineth him be times. You know, you look at it and and many people and of course young people feel that if their father was a little bit more like Eli, they would be happy. He lets me. My dad just lets me do whatever I want to do. Well, you're being ruined. Amen. And just want to look at what John Gil writes about it. I thought it was wonderful. He says, "He who withholds and or withdraws his rod of correction was in which is in his hand which he has power to use and ought to exercise at proper times. He instead of loving his son may be said to hate him. For such fond love is no better than hatred. And if he really hated him, he could scarcely do a more ill thing by him than not to correct him for a fault, which was the sin of good old Eli. And both he and his sons suffered for it. But he that loveth him that has a true love for his son, a hearty concern for his welfare and future good, he will regulate his affections by his judgment, and not give way to a fond passion to the prejudice of his child. But he chasenneth him be times. or in the morning in the morning of his infancy before vicious habits are contracted or he is accustomed to sinning and hardened in it or as soon as a crime is perpetrated before it is forgot or repeated or every morning as Jaryie and Aban Ezra that is continually as often as it is necessary or as faults are committed. Proverbs 23:13, "Withhold not correction from the child, for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat him with the rod and shall deliver his soul from hell." I guess it's very important to understand some some principles behind this. I have a few quotes from brother Brandham, but I think uh for the sake of time, I'll I'll do that another time. um biblical principles that we follow in correcting our children. Number one is uh an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. In other words, the punishment should be commensurate to the crime. In other words, it needs to be just. It's not just flying off the handle and spanking them 40, you know, uh 39 times because they took a piece of candy that you told them not to take. It's let let the punishment be commensurate to what they've done. You know, sit down and logically think out what the what the punishment should be before it's happened. That's what we do in government. It's also what we should do as parents is that they understand the consequences for the actions, you know, before they they reap the consequences. Number two is the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God. So correction should never be done in anger but with love, wisdom and careful thought. Number three, biblical instruction to them should be what the basis is of the correction. In other words, there should be teaching along with the the spanking that's going on. take the time to show them in the scripture about lying or about fighting or about stealing or about fits of anger etc etc. Wouldn't be a great thing if they are throwing a fit of anger for you to then throw a fit of anger and take a rod and correct them in the midst of that. You would be just reinforcing that fits of anger are normal. Take your time, be slow about it and use wisdom. Number four, the correction should result in restoring fellowship. It's not spank them in anger and then throw them throw them off and push them away from you. It's spanking them and then explaining them, comforting them, hugging them and restoring the fellowship whether it's between siblings or whether it's between uh par uh uh par the parent and the child whatever it might be. and then make sure that it is the parent that corrected is also the one that's giving comfort. These are godly uh principles from the scriptures. You know, brother Bham speaks in a couple different instances about the importance of using the rod of correction with your children. And he and he he says in multiple places, I just one of one of the quotes is quite lengthy. I I I wish I could read it now, but um just the general point that he he his his dad would take out the ramrod from his musket and whip him across the rear end with it. But his dad wouldn't do it right away. He said so many times he would say, "Tomorrow you're going to get it." Please, Dad, can it be now? And he would say, "Tomorrow." So, it's a good principle. Wait. Calm down. Don't do it in anger. Amen. Give it give it time. And he says, Brother Brandham says, "I deserved every one of the spankings that that my dad gave to me." And I I thank him. He said, "In fact, I deserved a lot more than than what I actually got." In other places, he he talks about um well, I'll just read that in the sermon. He hear ye him, Brother Brandham says, and you could see this. He mentions this uh in this way a few different times. Says, "And you come out and find Christian women laying out on the beach to get a tan." Well, I got two girls here tonight. I don't know what the future holds, but if I ever catch one of them when she's a young woman, of course, he's speaking about laying out in a bikini in in public on the beach, laying out on a beach to get a tan. She'll get a tanning. All right. It won't be from the sun. It'll be from Charles Brham's son with a barrel slat in his hand, bringing her home, making her jump every time. And so you see there the the need for correction. And of course, you understand that there's a balance just why we went through the biblical principles in all this of of our attitude, how to approach it, and understand that it's part of teaching. It isn't just a way for us to vent anger on our children. Um, it is a teaching tool to help them to understand. And it's a it's a biblical principle. In America, we feel like we are so revelated beyond biblical principles. But we need to slow down and settle down and realize that the God of the universe who spoke everything into existence, who governs everything on the planet, also gave us this word and he spoke it. And it's his principle in his scripture. And if we want our children to to be raised up right, we should follow what the word of God says. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your word, Lord. Amen. Truly, it's it's a light in a dark place. Lord, I pray that you would guide us and lead us and teach us in all this thing all these things. Lord, I realize that uh a man can or a woman can read the Bible and try to apply its principles, but without the Holy Spirit will get the balance of it wrong every time. Lord, give us your heart and your mind as as parents, as grandparents, even as young people in preparation. Lord, mold us and shape us into the image of Jesus Christ. We ask it in his lovely name, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
