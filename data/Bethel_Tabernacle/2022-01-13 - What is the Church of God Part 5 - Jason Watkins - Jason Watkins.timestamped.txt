[24:44] not get heavy
[24:46] and the hill would not be hard to
[24:51] climb oh no
[24:54] and he never offered
[24:56] our victories without fighting

[32:27] yeah i'm just going to kill it and start
[32:29] it again
[32:29] [Music]
[32:31] amen
[32:32] there's nothing a reset won't fix
[32:36] hey man let's see what oh there it is
[32:38] i like that
[32:40] amen
[32:41] just um
[32:43] fussy
[32:44] software so
[32:46] we're not going to worry about it
[32:49] amen praise the lord because um there's
[32:51] always an override button amen
[32:55] praise the lord all right
[32:57] let's uh have you turn in your bibles to
[32:59] hebrews chapter 12 this evening
[33:02] praise the lord
[33:05] hebrews chapter 12.
[33:09] i'm hoping tonight uh to continue
[33:14] in the little series that we've
[33:16] uh been working on here tonight would be
[33:18] part five of what is
[33:21] the true church of god
[33:23] i believe that god has a true church
[33:27] amen
[33:28] i believe that
[33:30] that we're it
[33:32] praise the lord i believe there's
[33:34] evidence to support that that we don't
[33:36] make that claim loosely but i believe
[33:39] there is evidence to support that
[33:41] and one of the
[33:43] the
[33:44] probably i would say the most telling
[33:48] evidence that we're taught
[33:50] is that when the word of god can come
[33:52] forward and you hear it and there's
[33:55] something inside of you a deep
[33:57] responding to a deep that not only can
[34:00] you
[34:01] not only can you identify with the word
[34:03] but you actually
[34:05] hear it and want more amen and it
[34:07] doesn't matter what it says even if it's
[34:10] you know uh
[34:11] sometimes the word of god deals with us
[34:13] real close we were sunday
[34:16] how was it we said that the the rubber
[34:18] wheels of the space shuttle
[34:20] uh come down and land on the road
[34:23] so
[34:24] uh tonight we've got kind of a mix of
[34:27] all of the above and i'm just continuing
[34:29] on in this series i can already see
[34:31] at least a couple more parts and so
[34:34] we're just trusting the lord
[34:36] that to say all to us everything that he
[34:39] wants to say now how many want to hear
[34:41] everything he has to say
[34:43] i sure have found
[34:45] that i have needed to hear a lot of this
[34:48] amen so
[34:50] hebrews chapter 12 we're going to catch
[34:52] verses 24 through
[34:55] 29.
[34:57] all right
[34:59] you have it say amen
[35:02] hebrews 12 24-29
[35:05] and to jesus the mediator of the new
[35:09] covenant
[35:10] and to the blood of sprinkling
[35:13] that speaketh better things than that of
[35:15] abel now paul had went on talking about
[35:17] how you weren't you aren't come to mount
[35:19] sinai you know moses and all the
[35:22] children of israel went to sinai and the
[35:25] mountain was on fire and the ground did
[35:27] shake
[35:28] but you've not come to that mountain
[35:31] but you've come to jesus the mediator of
[35:34] the new covenant
[35:36] and to the blood of sprinkling
[35:38] that speaketh better things than that of
[35:41] abel so so how many are glad to come to
[35:44] jesus
[35:46] he he's the one who mediates
[35:49] this new covenant between god and the
[35:52] people
[35:53] and to the sprinkled blood
[35:56] which as paul is saying here
[35:58] the sprinkled blood here under under
[36:01] under this new covenant is going to
[36:03] speak of forgiveness
[36:05] instead of crying out for vengeance like
[36:08] the blood of abel did
[36:10] make sense all right so it's a new
[36:13] covenant it doesn't cry for vengeance it
[36:16] cries for forgiveness
[36:18] all right
[36:19] see that verse 25
[36:22] see that you refuse not him that
[36:24] speaketh
[36:25] for if they escaped not now this is back
[36:27] there at sinai for if they escaped not
[36:31] who refused him that spake on earth
[36:34] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[36:38] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[36:41] whose voice back there at sinai whose
[36:44] voice then shook the earth but now
[36:47] under this new covenant
[36:49] now
[36:50] he hath promised so it's his future this
[36:52] is a prophecy he has promised saying
[36:55] yet once more i shake not the earth only
[36:59] but also heaven
[37:01] and this word yet once more
[37:04] signify here's what it means the
[37:07] removing of those things that are shaken
[37:11] as of the things that are made that
[37:13] those things which cannot be shaken
[37:17] may remain
[37:19] wherefore for this reason
[37:21] we receive a kingdom all of us under the
[37:23] new covenant all right
[37:25] we receive a kingdom which cannot be
[37:28] moved
[37:29] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[37:32] god acceptably
[37:34] with reverence
[37:36] and godly fear for our lord is a
[37:39] consuming fire so this means that all
[37:42] creation
[37:44] will be shaken
[37:45] and removed so that only unshakeable
[37:49] things remain
[37:50] you get it that's what's going on as the
[37:53] kingdom approaches
[37:55] amen that's what this whole prophecy is
[37:58] putting you on notice for that as the
[38:00] kingdom approaches and it's been
[38:02] approaching now for a little while
[38:04] see this is what brother branham taught
[38:06] us in the seventh seal when he makes a
[38:09] few mentions of things that have been
[38:10] going on all week and wondering if the
[38:12] people were catching it
[38:14] and he says you notice this you notice
[38:16] that he said what is it he's gonna he's
[38:18] gonna answer his own question it's the
[38:20] kingdom coming
[38:21] as it has been
[38:23] see
[38:24] as it has been coming the opening of the
[38:26] word is setting this bride the last
[38:30] gentile bride on the earth the bride
[38:33] that hears the opening of the seals that
[38:36] generation cannot pass away
[38:39] until
[38:40] until we're in the millennial kingdom
[38:43] all right now
[38:44] watch so so
[38:47] since we are so he says here since we
[38:50] are receiving a kingdom that is
[38:52] unshakable let us be thankful and please
[38:56] god
[38:57] how many want to do that
[38:58] by worshiping him with holy fear
[39:02] father we thank you for the reading of
[39:04] your word we give it into your hands and
[39:06] we ask now for the teaching spirit to
[39:08] come upon us lord that we might bring

[39:14] awareness father of what's happening in

[40:19] okay there we go got it okay so here's
[40:22] where we are
[40:23] so apparently jay i had to go ahead and
[40:25] hit that remote and use it in the
[40:26] presenter mode it wouldn't let me use
[40:28] the tiles
[40:29] okay so we should remember that so what
[40:32] is the church of god part 5 and we're
[40:35] continuing on our theme
[40:37] of a kingdom order now we spent a lot of
[40:40] time
[40:41] last week in a little bit of service
[40:43] prior
[40:44] trying to make you aware of that friends
[40:46] and i i would be hard-pressed to
[40:48] overstate
[40:50] how important this is that
[40:52] that you
[40:53] become aware
[40:55] that you become cognizant of the fact
[40:59] that we have entered a certain order
[41:02] just getting ready to lead in the
[41:03] millennium in other words we're not
[41:05] god's not going to come down and just
[41:07] say okay it's time let's all go into the
[41:11] millennium god has already been working
[41:14] on the kingdom of god because remember
[41:18] that
[41:18] your coming
[41:21] this this last bride this last age
[41:24] coming
[41:24] to the word of god in this hour and
[41:27] becoming that word of god in this hour
[41:30] that it is that accomplishment in you
[41:33] that literally brings the saints out of
[41:36] the ground they without us they without
[41:39] you catching that you're in a kingdom
[41:41] and the kingdom is coming and a
[41:43] kingdom's already here that kingdom is
[41:46] blending in to this life
[41:49] and as such then it it it makes a call
[41:53] upon our life it makes a call that we
[41:57] recognize this is what's what's god is
[42:00] doing
[42:01] and that there is an order for us to be
[42:03] living so no more are we able to live
[42:07] and get by under the partial light of
[42:10] the previous ages god is bringing a
[42:13] bride up the pyramid to the capstone
[42:16] which brings this bride into his very
[42:19] image now i want to i want to really i'm
[42:23] sure you get that so what this what this
[42:26] portion tonight is about
[42:29] is what happens when we don't do that
[42:33] what happens when we recognize it we see
[42:36] it you say preacher i hear you i get it
[42:39] i understand it okay i'll try my best
[42:42] but we're not very successful
[42:44] at it
[42:45] then
[42:46] how limiting
[42:48] is that going to be
[42:50] of the power of god in our lives and i'm
[42:53] going to tell you something friends we
[42:54] have entered into a day
[42:57] a time
[42:58] a shaking of the earth where you can ill
[43:02] afford to be low on the power of god
[43:07] you believe it
[43:08] we're
[43:09] the world is in a shaking time and this
[43:12] is part of the prophecy now
[43:15] paul is referencing haggai chapter 2 the
[43:18] prophecy he gave and i'm going to give
[43:20] it to you out of the out of the nlt all
[43:23] right
[43:24] if i can get it to work
[43:27] and if we can't
[43:29] we will not
[43:31] we will not keep fussing over it
[43:34] and it's not going to
[43:37] all right eufine
[43:43] oh there it went thank you
[43:45] oh that was you i said derek thank you
[43:48] okay bradley you just you just carry
[43:50] forward i'm gonna close it down and we
[43:52] ain't gonna worry about it
[43:54] all right
[43:56] let me make one change whoops don't want
[43:57] to do that
[44:02] very good all right
[44:04] all right so i i'm sure you're with me
[44:07] all right now so here is the prophecy in
[44:10] haggai chapter 2 that paul is
[44:12] referencing in hebrews 12.
[44:15] for this is what the lord of heaven's
[44:19] armies says
[44:21] in just a little while
[44:23] i will again shake the heavens and the
[44:26] earth
[44:27] the oceans and the dry land
[44:30] i will shake all the nations
[44:32] and the treasures of all the nations
[44:36] will be brought to this temple
[44:38] i will fit this filled this place with
[44:42] glory
[44:43] says the lord of heaven's armies
[44:46] the silver is mine and the gold is mine
[44:49] says the lord of heaven's armies the
[44:53] future glory of this temple will be
[44:56] greater than in past glory
[44:58] says the lord of heaven's armies and in
[45:02] this place i will bring peace i
[45:06] the lord of heaven's armies have spoken
[45:10] now there's various places in the bible
[45:14] where you can see
[45:15] who
[45:16] this
[45:17] heaven's armies are if you go into
[45:20] zechariah 3 we're not going to go there
[45:21] tonight but if you would go to zechariah
[45:23] 3 you will find that that
[45:27] that zechariah that joshua the high
[45:29] priest is given a promise
[45:31] that if you will keep my word and do all
[45:34] that i command you then i will give you
[45:37] a place to stand among those who are
[45:39] standing here
[45:41] so you have to realize that joshua the
[45:43] high priest was caught up into the
[45:45] courtroom of god and there was a
[45:47] heavenly host standing around there were
[45:49] officers heavenly beings and and and
[45:53] he's told that if you want to get here
[45:56] and stand among these that you see then
[45:59] all you have to do is keep my word and
[46:01] observe my ways
[46:03] we find that in revelation 5 you're
[46:06] going to see these armies again you're
[46:08] going to see
[46:09] the angelic host which is not
[46:11] necessarily the same as the armies
[46:13] because the armies is seen in the four
[46:16] and 20 elders it's seen in a strong
[46:19] angel standing there proclaiming who's
[46:22] worthy it's seen in john who's a
[46:24] representative of the bride if there's a
[46:27] sea before him and we find that these
[46:29] are partial glimpses of heaven's armies
[46:33] it's what's beautiful is that god is
[46:37] speaking as a family
[46:40] that he's saying to the world
[46:42] i'm here to tell you that when i bring
[46:45] about this shaking when i get ready to
[46:48] bring my kingdom the world's going to
[46:50] realize i've had a family all this time
[46:53] and now i'm actually going to be moving
[46:56] through you finally see her really clear
[47:00] in revelation 19
[47:02] when christ comes riding out to get on
[47:05] with the millennium to get on with the
[47:07] with armageddon to finish the matter and
[47:10] to and to and and the
[47:13] marriage supper's already over the
[47:15] tribulation is winding to an end
[47:17] armageddon is now underway and he comes
[47:19] riding out and the people who see it
[47:22] wail because of him they're not happy to
[47:24] see him and these armies of heaven are
[47:27] with him now friends if i can show you
[47:30] that god is speaking as a family in
[47:33] zechariah 3 he's speaking as a family in
[47:37] haggai chapter 2
[47:39] revelation 5 shows him as a family
[47:41] revelation 19 shows him as a family then
[47:45] you ought to be able to say there's a
[47:48] family and i'm in it
[47:50] and if there's a family that's not just
[47:53] a lucky thing to say oh great i get to
[47:55] be a family if you're in that family
[47:58] then you have a responsibility and i'm
[47:59] here to tell you that god is looking to
[48:02] you his family to fulfill his promise
[48:06] here in the last days
[48:09] so i want to say tonight that there
[48:12] aren't there is no option
[48:15] on this
[48:17] you're not going to be allowed and
[48:19] and i and i really
[48:21] i i want to come across in such a way
[48:24] that i'm
[48:26] warning you
[48:27] but i'm also reasoning with you and i'm
[48:30] also pleading with you if i can figure
[48:33] out how to mash all of that up and warn
[48:35] you as a watchman on the wall and reason
[48:37] with you to show you in the scriptures
[48:39] why what i'm saying is true and then
[48:41] plead with you please uh get in line get
[48:45] in step let your life be changed into
[48:48] the image of what god is trying to
[48:50] accomplish in his armies
[48:54] because if you don't
[48:56] if you don't
[48:58] then you're going to find yourself
[49:00] on the
[49:01] on the the unpleasant side of god's
[49:04] determination
[49:06] amen
[49:08] so
[49:09] so when we think about this now
[49:12] such a contrast between the two
[49:14] covenants and and there's a focus now uh
[49:18] paul is focusing on this new con on this
[49:21] new covenant and he contrasts with the
[49:24] covenant of mount sinai and and and and
[49:27] this contrast between a warning given
[49:32] on on earth and one that issues from
[49:35] heaven itself and god is saying i shook
[49:37] the earth back then but at the end time
[49:41] i'm shaking
[49:42] everything well how much are you shaking
[49:45] everything
[49:46] well what's going to be left that's not
[49:49] shaken
[49:50] the only thing that will be left is what
[49:52] remains after the shaking
[49:55] the world if you wonder why the world is
[49:58] crazy it's being shaken down
[50:02] some now
[50:03] here's the rub
[50:05] that if you find your life being shaken
[50:07] to pieces you might need to back up
[50:11] and think am i in the line and order of
[50:15] god's word because i know there's a
[50:17] shaking coming but i'm supposed to
[50:19] survive it
[50:21] and if i'm not surviving the shaking why
[50:24] not
[50:25] i'm a believer
[50:27] i love god
[50:29] why am i breaking under the shaking amen
[50:34] you with me
[50:35] all right
[50:37] so
[50:38] so we realized then this reference to
[50:40] haggai chapter 2 then is understood
[50:43] uh
[50:44] as speaking of the ultimate remaking of
[50:47] the heavens and the earth which of
[50:49] course is going to
[50:50] the millennium is going to advance that
[50:52] after the millennium after the
[50:54] millennial kingdom uh it's going to
[50:56] advance it more and just remember
[50:58] there's another war at the end of the
[51:00] millennium you remember that
[51:02] see so so what haggai is saying that
[51:05] that once i get started once i come to
[51:08] the end time once the world starts
[51:11] falling apart and and actually it's me
[51:14] shaking it and i'm shaking my family i'm
[51:17] shaking all families because i what are
[51:20] you doing god i'm purifying
[51:23] i'm purifying my family and in the
[51:26] process of doing that the whole world
[51:28] who can't take the shaking is collapsing
[51:32] and that's why you see the madness on
[51:34] the streets that you see the the
[51:36] craziness of the world is not an
[51:39] accident it's driven by god it's driven
[51:42] by prophecy it's purpose driven god is
[51:45] known about it all the time jesus warned
[51:48] that there be wars and rumors of wars
[51:50] and earthquakes and divers places don't
[51:52] worry those things have to be the ends
[51:54] not yet but there is coming a time when
[51:57] it is going to signal okay no more ages
[52:00] it's now time to wrap up and i'm gonna
[52:03] do a final shaking on the world and the
[52:06] whole world's gonna go completely insane
[52:11] and the only people
[52:13] who will survive
[52:15] is my family
[52:17] the only people
[52:19] who
[52:20] who will
[52:21] stand true
[52:22] to my word is people my family who i
[52:25] reveal myself to
[52:27] and so so we realized then that that
[52:30] that that whatever remains
[52:33] after all of this cataclysmic shaking
[52:37] whatever remains will be eternal now
[52:40] that's a huge point
[52:41] don't don't lose sight of that god's not
[52:43] shaking for the sake of shaking he's not
[52:46] shaking just to rough you up he's he's
[52:49] transitioning
[52:51] the world is transitioning and i can't
[52:55] stop it you can't stop it nobody can
[52:57] stop it and god has purposed it and it's
[53:00] happening all around you i would say to
[53:02] you today you better get with the
[53:04] program because the world is
[53:06] transitioning
[53:08] and what is it transitioning to
[53:10] it's coming back to its eternal day now
[53:13] that's beautiful because
[53:15] that because that means
[53:17] that whatever was original
[53:21] all right whatever was original that's
[53:25] what is coming back let me pull up
[53:27] something here
[53:29] so whatever was original that's what god
[53:33] is coming to
[53:34] now
[53:35] this means of course
[53:37] since everything that's original is what
[53:39] he's restoring that back to
[53:42] then then then that means that the power
[53:46] of this new covenant
[53:48] is to restore you
[53:50] to original
[53:51] and i just say thank god
[53:54] i just say thank god i thought about
[53:55] that today and i just thought he's
[53:57] bringing the world back to its original
[54:00] and the only way that can go forward is
[54:02] he's bringing you an eye back to the
[54:04] original and that couldn't be possible
[54:07] if he hadn't said a word to this hour
[54:09] that's the original word because the
[54:11] spoken word is the original seed see and
[54:14] it's the only one is the same seed
[54:17] friends listen
[54:19] the same seed word that you are
[54:22] receiving today is the very same seed
[54:26] word that he used in genesis when he
[54:29] created the heavens and the earth and
[54:31] when he put a garden there and made it
[54:33] beautiful when he took an earth that was
[54:35] in chaos and he reversed it all and made
[54:38] a beautiful garden i'm here to tell you
[54:40] don't worry about chaos in your life he
[54:41] can turn anything beautiful
[54:44] he can make it all back to its original
[54:48] so so that means then that none of the
[54:50] things listen now
[54:53] that means that none of the things
[54:56] a sin birth hung on me
[54:59] will survive
[55:01] i'll take that deal
[55:04] amen
[55:05] nothing
[55:06] that the sin birth hung on me
[55:09] nothing that happened to me
[55:11] in my life
[55:13] nothing that happened to you i want you
[55:15] to know something friends sometimes we
[55:17] get really tortured and tormented by our
[55:20] past
[55:21] and i don't just mean merely
[55:24] regretting it
[55:25] i mean the
[55:27] the thing that it does to our spirit and
[55:29] our determination and our mind and we
[55:32] find ourselves with weaknesses
[55:34] because of things that happen to us in
[55:36] our past
[55:37] and we get complexes and we have
[55:40] troubles and these things come upon us
[55:42] and i'm here to tell you that nothing
[55:44] that happened to me in my life that
[55:46] might have created weaknesses for satan
[55:49] to exploit nor
[55:51] the things that even i might have did to
[55:54] myself that caused me harm today i'm
[55:56] here to tell you in this kingdom time
[55:58] none of that's surviving
[56:00] i'll take that deal how many want that
[56:02] deal none of that is surviving this is
[56:05] the age of liberty and freedom and god
[56:07] is restoring your life to kingdom
[56:09] position
[56:12] brother branham comes to the pulpit in
[56:14] the closing months of 1963
[56:16] preaches two sermons right close
[56:18] together in november
[56:20] the world is falling apart and it comes
[56:22] up later the world is again falling
[56:24] apart
[56:26] and we find that that that
[56:29] we now you know
[56:31] brother branham is going to reference
[56:32] hebrews 12 where we read our text
[56:35] that this is the time and he's trying to
[56:37] get the world to understand
[56:39] you're in that shaking time
[56:42] this is
[56:43] paul's this is haggai's prophecy this is
[56:46] what paul was talking about and brother
[56:49] branham is trying to tell the late great
[56:51] planet earth this is where you're at
[56:54] it's 1963 the seven seals have been
[56:58] opened the mighty god has been unveiled
[57:00] there's an infant bride now but she's
[57:02] growing quickly she's becoming mature
[57:05] and and world the more the more she
[57:08] matures the worse you're going to get
[57:10] the more she rises the more you're going
[57:12] to descend the more she achieves the
[57:15] more you're going to lose and we're here
[57:17] today where the world has lost every
[57:19] semblance of all of its morality and its
[57:22] value and its sanity and its reason and
[57:25] common sense they don't even have common
[57:27] sense anymore fear is stalking men fear
[57:31] stalking the politics fear stalking
[57:34] every every aspect and here's a pride
[57:36] with perfect faith looking at a promise
[57:39] and feeling the holy spirit moving our
[57:41] lives changing us from glory to glory
[57:46] none of that's an accident
[57:48] that's all happening
[57:50] it's all part of the plan
[57:53] now believers look at the chaos of the
[57:56] world
[57:58] all right
[58:00] and easily believers look at the chaos
[58:03] and easily accept
[58:06] that the time of shaking heaven and
[58:08] earth is here
[58:10] we look around at the chaos we don't
[58:11] have any problems saying it's here
[58:14] it's arrived
[58:16] now to you it almost feels like
[58:18] yeah of course it is who wouldn't know
[58:20] that you're the only one who does
[58:24] the rest of the world say they don't
[58:26] know it well if they know it why aren't
[58:28] they running to the word why are they
[58:30] still trying to fix it with another
[58:32] super politician or pass another law or
[58:34] give away more money or have another
[58:36] legislation or
[58:38] or change the educational system why
[58:40] don't they do that because they don't
[58:42] realize they can't fix it
[58:46] and they won't take god's provided way
[58:49] to fix it they're blind to it because
[58:52] they sowed to denominational seed and a
[58:55] prophet warned them and warned them and
[58:57] warned them and warned them if you keep
[58:59] sowing to that when the harvest comes
[59:02] and when he starts shaking the world
[59:04] that's going to be your crop you won't
[59:06] be able to have any other crop and it's
[59:08] going to take you to the mark of the
[59:09] beast but to the bride who has been
[59:11] sowing the word it's also going to bring
[59:14] her to a wee harvest in this hour
[59:17] the same
[59:19] listen friends just as sure as the world
[59:21] is crazy
[59:22] you're holy
[59:25] just as sure as the world is being
[59:27] destroyed you're going in a rapture
[59:30] one's not more sure than the other
[59:32] they're both the exact promise that god
[59:34] said this is what he would do
[59:36] he would destroy the world and he would
[59:38] take his bride out of it
[59:40] before it can happen
[59:43] see
[59:44] so believers look at the chaos of the
[59:47] world
[59:48] easily except that the time of shaking
[59:50] heaven and earth is here we certainly
[59:53] can see that we hear brother branham
[59:55] preaching on hebrews 12 we say there's a
[59:57] prophet identifying a prophecy and he's
[1:00:00] identifying it that it's happening right
[1:00:02] now but while believers can easily agree
[1:00:05] to that and they can see the madness of
[1:00:08] the world and they can agree that it's
[1:00:10] the time of shaking but they are too
[1:00:13] often afraid
[1:00:14] to realize the other half of the promise
[1:00:18] believers have a hard time sometimes
[1:00:20] believing the other half
[1:00:22] and the other half is not everything is
[1:00:25] being destroyed
[1:00:27] you understand there is a kingdom people
[1:00:30] who are going to stand tall in this hour
[1:00:33] i happen to believe i'm one of them
[1:00:37] i happen to believe i'm preaching to
[1:00:39] many of them there is a kingdom people
[1:00:43] who will recognize and who have
[1:00:45] recognized their day and its message
[1:00:47] there's a kingdom people who listen who
[1:00:50] leave here as overcomers and i don't
[1:00:52] care what the devil has in plan there is
[1:00:55] a people here a kingdom people who live
[1:00:58] here in victory
[1:01:01] who leave here as an overcomer i'm not
[1:01:03] just here to recognize that the time of

[1:02:01] things go whether i did them to myself
[1:02:04] whether somebody else did them to me

[1:02:10] age or whatever is happening to you i'm

[1:02:49] it tonight but we have a kingdom
[1:02:52] being brought into a position take
[1:02:55] courage because the kingdom is being

[1:03:05] friends what you're being what you're
[1:03:07] being challenged to step into and what

[1:03:39] that will never end he is shaking
[1:03:41] everything loose from our lives
[1:03:45] to prepare you for the millennium amen
[1:03:49] don't lose sight of that i'm going to
[1:03:50] show you an example tonight
[1:03:52] of what god is doing i want to make that
[1:03:55] statement again
[1:03:56] he's shaking everything loose from our
[1:03:58] lives
[1:04:00] to prepare you for the millennium now
[1:04:03] this shaking can really be painful
[1:04:08] this shaking can really
[1:04:10] put your life in a turmoil
[1:04:13] and it'll be god doing it
[1:04:16] you say well i don't i don't want to go
[1:04:18] through a turmoil then surrender and
[1:04:20] live under the power
[1:04:22] see he's bri he's shaking
[1:04:24] he's shaking everything off of you that
[1:04:27] wasn't in the original and it's those
[1:04:30] things that are holding you back from
[1:04:32] walking in the freedom so you know what
[1:04:33] he's doing he's shaking your life he's
[1:04:36] shaking your home he's shaking your
[1:04:38] finances he's shaking your health he's
[1:04:40] shaking your friends
[1:04:43] he's shaking your mind
[1:04:45] he's shaking your spirit he's shaking
[1:04:48] your heart
[1:04:49] he's shaking everything people say my
[1:04:52] goodness i'm under so much anxiety it
[1:04:54] might be god doing it
[1:04:58] all right
[1:05:00] now we're not talking about god bringing
[1:05:01] sickness on his children father ram said
[1:05:03] god don't do that but he does allow the
[1:05:05] devil to do it when it serves his
[1:05:06] purpose and i'm here to say you're going
[1:05:08] to get sick if you don't straighten up
[1:05:09] that's not even what my sermon's about
[1:05:12] all right my sermon is about that there
[1:05:14] is a kingdom anointing here that you
[1:05:16] don't even have to have that
[1:05:17] conversation
[1:05:19] you can go right around and bypass that
[1:05:21] conversation and just say satan doesn't
[1:05:23] matter what happened to me in my life
[1:05:24] today i'm free
[1:05:27] and i will no longer let you govern my
[1:05:30] mind and govern because i'm going to
[1:05:32] tell you something friends deeds begin
[1:05:34] in your mind
[1:05:36] and that's why brother branham would say
[1:05:38] people say oh the devil made me do it
[1:05:40] and brother em said no he never
[1:05:42] said you were sealed in and he was
[1:05:44] sealed out said you went out to him
[1:05:47] he brought a thought over through your
[1:05:48] mind and you entertain that thought and
[1:05:50] that thought became a deed and that's
[1:05:52] why the bible says bring every thought
[1:05:54] captive
[1:05:55] bring it captive bring it subject to the
[1:05:57] holy spirit the holy spirit of the word
[1:05:59] will destroy it immediately it'll start
[1:06:01] cleaning up your lives and it'll remove
[1:06:04] things out of your life and your home
[1:06:06] and your experiences that keep
[1:06:08] contaminating you because we got to go
[1:06:10] home friends we got to get out of here
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:15] so the good news of the gospel
[1:06:18] it's not just that we can be saved by
[1:06:21] christ but that we are literally being
[1:06:24] renewed
[1:06:25] into the image of christ i just say take
[1:06:28] that devil
[1:06:31] i i'm not here to just say oh hallelujah
[1:06:33] he saved me no he saved me and he's
[1:06:36] perfecting me
[1:06:38] and there's nothing that the enemy can
[1:06:40] do to stop it
[1:06:42] my
[1:06:43] my part is to
[1:06:45] be willing to release everything about
[1:06:48] me and just let me be him
[1:06:52] see and when you don't do that
[1:06:55] now i'm coming to the reasoning and the
[1:06:57] pleading and the warning when you don't
[1:06:59] do that
[1:07:00] look for turmoil
[1:07:02] see i'll show it to you in the bible
[1:07:05] so this is god restoring
[1:07:08] the genesis image now the genesis image
[1:07:10] is when you stood uh
[1:07:12] perfect in his view how many want to go
[1:07:14] back to that
[1:07:15] he stood perfect in his view that was
[1:07:17] the first place brother brown said you
[1:07:19] never sin in the first place that was
[1:07:20] the first place in the mind of god
[1:07:23] before you were born in sin or or or or
[1:07:27] let's just make it a little more
[1:07:28] something we can get our mind around you
[1:07:30] know not only before you were born in
[1:07:32] sin but before you came here born in sin
[1:07:35] and accumulated a life of failures
[1:07:39] that now hinder you
[1:07:42] we've accumulated plenty
[1:07:44] haven't we
[1:07:45] come on come on
[1:07:47] we've accumulated i'm saying we i'm in
[1:07:49] this with you we've accumulated plenty
[1:07:51] i'm tired of accumulating
[1:07:53] hallelujah
[1:07:55] i'm telling i'm here to tell you he's
[1:07:57] shaking off their effect and satan is
[1:08:00] losing his grip on me his grip to move
[1:08:03] me his grip to to influence me he's
[1:08:06] losing that because i'm letting all of
[1:08:08] that go
[1:08:10] and i'm allowing god
[1:08:12] to bring me
[1:08:13] to a perfection
[1:08:15] slide number
[1:08:17] nine brother brad
[1:08:21] the gospel of luke now listen to this
[1:08:26] and they came to him
[1:08:28] and awoke him saying
[1:08:30] master master we perish see
[1:08:34] then he arose
[1:08:36] and rebuked the wind and the raging of
[1:08:39] the water so they were they were being
[1:08:41] tossed
[1:08:43] on a stormy sea
[1:08:45] now you're on a sea of life
[1:08:47] and sometimes we find ourselves tossed
[1:08:50] on the stormy sea and you say what is my
[1:08:52] answer and brother branham said wake
[1:08:54] jesus
[1:08:55] wake jesus
[1:08:57] he's in the boat he promised you he
[1:08:59] would never leave you the problem is
[1:09:01] you've let him go to sleep in your life
[1:09:02] you don't pray like you used to pray you
[1:09:04] don't attend church like you used to
[1:09:05] attend church you don't hear the tapes
[1:09:07] like you used to hear tapes you don't
[1:09:08] read your bible like you used to read
[1:09:09] your bible come on friends
[1:09:12] and what's happened he's he's you
[1:09:14] haven't lost your salvation you haven't
[1:09:16] lost your redemption that's impossible
[1:09:18] paul makes that clear it's impossible
[1:09:20] because then the transgressor once he's
[1:09:23] purged to renew him again would be
[1:09:25] totally impossible uh christ would have
[1:09:28] to come and re-die for him again so paul
[1:09:30] said there's there's no way that can
[1:09:32] even happen
[1:09:33] and so so we realized then that a
[1:09:35] prophet said what you need to do is wake
[1:09:38] him up in your life you're wondering why
[1:09:40] you're not surviving the storms of life
[1:09:42] wake up jesus
[1:09:44] amen see
[1:09:46] master master we perished then he arose
[1:09:49] and rebuked the wind and the raging of
[1:09:50] the water
[1:09:52] and they ceased and there was a calm and
[1:09:54] he said unto them where is your faith
[1:09:59] see
[1:10:00] so take courage
[1:10:02] because even apostles themselves
[1:10:05] had to learn this the hard way
[1:10:08] a bunch of times
[1:10:10] so take courage
[1:10:11] if you're feeling like
[1:10:13] brother jason's getting going a little
[1:10:14] bit too much on the warning side and
[1:10:17] could you go back to the pleading side
[1:10:20] could we just reason together a little
[1:10:21] bit more
[1:10:23] okay let me give you a little little
[1:10:24] little piece of candy take courage even
[1:10:27] the apostles had to learn that the hard
[1:10:30] way
[1:10:31] jesus had to look right at the apostles
[1:10:34] right there they are these men who are
[1:10:37] going to where the whole church is going
[1:10:39] to be based on the doctrine of the
[1:10:40] apostles and prophets and they've got to
[1:10:42] have jesus look them in the eye and go
[1:10:44] where was your faith
[1:10:46] you saw what i did you're my family
[1:10:49] uh where's your faith why are you afraid
[1:10:54] see
[1:10:55] and so
[1:10:56] if we go to slide 10 we're going to look
[1:10:58] at james chapter 1 verse 5 to 8
[1:11:02] if any of you lack wisdom
[1:11:05] let him ask of god
[1:11:07] that giveth to all men liberally
[1:11:10] and upbraideth not and it shall be given
[1:11:12] him
[1:11:13] but but
[1:11:15] let him ask in faith
[1:11:17] nothing wavering
[1:11:19] for he that wavereth is like a wave of
[1:11:22] the sea man this sea this storm stormy
[1:11:25] seas there's something there's something
[1:11:26] going on here all right
[1:11:29] for he is like a wave of the sea
[1:11:32] driven with the wind and tossed
[1:11:36] let not that man think that he shall
[1:11:39] receive anything of the lord
[1:11:43] a double-minded man
[1:11:45] is unstable
[1:11:47] in all his ways
[1:11:50] so if i've got an unstable son i'm not
[1:11:53] going to give him the keys to the car
[1:11:56] i'm not going to i'm not going to let
[1:11:58] him go on a vacation
[1:12:00] all expenses paid because he's unstable
[1:12:03] i got up training how to live in the
[1:12:06] world i've got to train him how to take
[1:12:07] responsibility this is what james is
[1:12:10] saying god's a father and he's you're
[1:12:12] never gonna get anything from him if
[1:12:14] you're unstable
[1:12:16] if you're unstable in your mind listen
[1:12:19] friends if you're unstable in your faith
[1:12:22] you're unstable in all your ways and i
[1:12:25] have seen that i have seen that people
[1:12:27] who are double-minded and weak in faith
[1:12:30] they're unstable in their marriages
[1:12:32] they're unstable in their friendships
[1:12:34] they're unstable in their finances
[1:12:36] they're unstable in their reputation
[1:12:38] they're unstable in their testimony
[1:12:39] they're unstable in in in their
[1:12:41] lifestyle they're unstable in their
[1:12:43] prayer life they're unstable in church
[1:12:45] attendance they're unstable in
[1:12:47] fellowship they're unst they're unstable
[1:12:49] in all their ways
[1:12:53] everything around them has instability
[1:12:55] through it
[1:12:57] see
[1:12:58] this is not to be for the kingdom people
[1:13:01] this is not god's purpose for your life
[1:13:04] you're a kingdom nation
[1:13:07] see
[1:13:11] there is
[1:13:12] what you think
[1:13:15] and then there is what god thinks
[1:13:20] you say what does he think whatever he
[1:13:21] says in his word
[1:13:24] you might think of yourself as a failure
[1:13:27] that's not what his word says
[1:13:31] you might think that the devil's got you
[1:13:33] thinking you don't stand a chance
[1:13:34] because you got too many weaknesses but
[1:13:36] that's not what
[1:13:38] god thinks
[1:13:39] but if you you might think you can't get
[1:13:42] healed because you've been prayed for so
[1:13:44] many times you just can't get healed but
[1:13:45] that's not what his word says
[1:13:48] say his word says he'll heal me no
[1:13:50] says you're already healed
[1:13:53] see so as soon as you immediately as
[1:13:56] soon as you think i can't be healed
[1:13:57] you've already broke the word
[1:13:59] you don't got to go and nanosecond after
[1:14:00] that as soon as you determine oh i can i
[1:14:02] must can't get healed god must not he
[1:14:04] must not want to heal me that's not
[1:14:06] according to his word
[1:14:08] see this is why brother branham would
[1:14:09] say and there's quotes for it he said he
[1:14:11] said every person down that line down
[1:14:13] that wall waiting to be prayed for he
[1:14:15] said i'm just as sure as anything that
[1:14:17] god wants to heal every last single
[1:14:19] solitary one of them
[1:14:20] and there were meetings that god did
[1:14:22] heal every last single solitary person
[1:14:25] brother brown talks about it comes to a
[1:14:26] meeting and refers back to a meeting in
[1:14:28] grass valley california and he said the
[1:14:30] power of god was so great and the
[1:14:31] sincerity the people's heart was so
[1:14:33] great and faith was so high he said
[1:14:35] every single person that was sick left
[1:14:37] healed there wasn't one affliction left
[1:14:40] when those meetings were over i want to
[1:14:42] tell you something friends that's the
[1:14:44] power of god
[1:14:45] that's when and all and those people
[1:14:47] weren't better than you but they were
[1:14:49] sincere before god see
[1:14:54] if anything has astounded me over the
[1:14:56] years of ministry
[1:14:58] this people's willingness
[1:15:01] wow i that's not a strong enough word
[1:15:03] probably determination
[1:15:06] people tenacity
[1:15:08] comes to my mind
[1:15:10] the the determination
[1:15:12] the tenacious
[1:15:14] determination
[1:15:16] to believe
[1:15:17] what they want to believe
[1:15:19] when it's not true
[1:15:24] people get things fixed in their mind
[1:15:26] and you can't move them no matter how
[1:15:28] many scriptures you've got no matter how
[1:15:30] many quotes you can't bring them up out
[1:15:33] of the out of the pits of despair you
[1:15:35] can't get them to believe for their
[1:15:37] healing you can't get them to you can't
[1:15:40] get them past their complexes
[1:15:42] it doesn't matter how hard you try they
[1:15:45] with tenacious determination they hold
[1:15:48] on to it
[1:15:50] and they wound themselves
[1:15:53] and they live underprivileged constantly
[1:15:56] see
[1:15:59] people
[1:16:01] live in the chains of their past
[1:16:06] lingering pain
[1:16:09] lingering
[1:16:11] in
[1:16:12] defeat
[1:16:13] lingering holding holding the holding
[1:16:16] the key
[1:16:17] of deliverance in their hand

[1:17:17] a sickness called double-mindedness

[1:18:38] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:18:41] now look at look at these descriptive
[1:18:43] terms
[1:18:45] children
[1:18:47] tossed
[1:18:48] carried
[1:18:50] okay
[1:18:51] here's why the word comes
[1:18:53] here's why the kingdom age is here
[1:18:56] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:18:59] tossed
[1:19:00] to and fro carried about see so so if
[1:19:04] you find yourself constantly tossed
[1:19:06] about in your mind
[1:19:08] if you finally constantly your your
[1:19:10] faith is tossed about your heart is
[1:19:12] tossed about your spirit is your
[1:19:14] spirit's always tossed about your heart
[1:19:16] is always tossed about your faith is
[1:19:17] always tossed about your commitment is
[1:19:19] always your dedication you're overcoming
[1:19:22] it's always it's always tossed
[1:19:25] you're up then you're down
[1:19:28] you're on point making good progress
[1:19:30] then you
[1:19:31] you get derailed again by by the curves
[1:19:34] that life throws you and i'm here to
[1:19:36] tell you life will just keep throwing
[1:19:37] them the devil will make sure it just
[1:19:39] keeps throwing you curve after curve
[1:19:41] after curve because he can see that
[1:19:43] every time you get a little traction and
[1:19:44] you start going down you're on you're in
[1:19:46] that train that glory bound train and
[1:19:49] you're starting to chuck down the tracks
[1:19:50] you know what he'll do he'll derail you
[1:19:53] he'll put a curve in your rail that you
[1:19:55] weren't expecting and run you right off
[1:19:56] out in the field somewhere and pile you
[1:19:58] up
[1:20:00] this is the kingdom hour
[1:20:02] that's not where we are to be living
[1:20:06] you need to grow out of that
[1:20:10] does that hurt your feelings
[1:20:13] listen
[1:20:14] everything i'm saying you had to say to
[1:20:15] me you need to grow you need to grow out
[1:20:17] of that
[1:20:18] you need to grow out of the
[1:20:19] inconsistencies in your walk
[1:20:22] you need to grow out of the complexes of
[1:20:24] your life you need to grow out of the
[1:20:25] fears and anxieties you need to grow out
[1:20:28] of that how many go say amen don't get
[1:20:30] quiet
[1:20:32] you need to grow out of that friends
[1:20:34] say why haven't i grown out of it
[1:20:35] brother jason i've been a believer for
[1:20:37] many years you have resisted god's child
[1:20:39] training
[1:20:41] that's come on that's the bold truth
[1:20:45] why haven't you grown out of it why
[1:20:47] haven't i grown why are things that that
[1:20:49] i should have grown out of years ago me
[1:20:52] brother jason things that i should have
[1:20:54] grown out of years ago you know why i
[1:20:56] haven't because i've resisted god's
[1:20:58] child training
[1:21:01] consequently
[1:21:04] when you do that
[1:21:05] your growth is always a problem it's
[1:21:07] always going to be a problem listen
[1:21:09] friends the role of holy ghost
[1:21:12] it's amazing to me that people
[1:21:14] talk so
[1:21:16] so glowingly about their holy ghost
[1:21:20] but the holy ghost is sent to grow you
[1:21:24] the holy ghost isn't a plaque you put on
[1:21:27] the wall
[1:21:29] the holy ghost is to grow you
[1:21:32] say i've got the holy ghost then let it
[1:21:33] grow you
[1:21:36] why do you keep the holy ghost standing
[1:21:37] in the corner with his arms folded
[1:21:38] because you won't grow
[1:21:42] see
[1:21:44] remember that the bible says that the
[1:21:46] the that the grace of god god's grace
[1:21:49] hath called us under his eternal glory
[1:21:51] you believe that
[1:21:52] i don't have it on the powerpoint but
[1:21:54] first peter 5 declares that
[1:21:57] but the grace of all but the god of all
[1:21:59] grace who hath called us unto his
[1:22:01] eternal glory by christ jesus after that
[1:22:04] we have suffered a while
[1:22:06] make you perfect
[1:22:08] establish
[1:22:09] strengthen
[1:22:10] settle you
[1:22:13] the holy ghost is here to establish you
[1:22:16] to strengthen you to settle you
[1:22:20] to make you a firm in your faith to make
[1:22:23] you a king's child
[1:22:26] operating by kingdom
[1:22:28] standards operating kingdom power in
[1:22:32] your life
[1:22:35] so paul goes on uh
[1:22:38] let's see did i did i include it
[1:22:41] that way okay that we henceforth
[1:22:43] be no more children
[1:22:45] tossed
[1:22:46] to
[1:22:47] and fro
[1:22:49] he goes on about how that
[1:22:51] of doctrine
[1:22:52] tossed to and fro there's doctrine
[1:22:54] that'll do it
[1:22:56] the slight of men will do it sometimes
[1:22:58] people do you wrong can you handle it
[1:23:03] no
[1:23:04] you can't
[1:23:05] how did jesus say to handle it when you
[1:23:06] get done wrong
[1:23:09] see
[1:23:10] how did jesus say to handle it when
[1:23:13] you're actually for real no kidding done
[1:23:15] wrong
[1:23:17] see
[1:23:18] by the doctrine
[1:23:21] by the sleight of men
[1:23:23] by cunning craftiness
[1:23:25] whereby they lie in wait to deceive
[1:23:28] you know i i i wanna i wanna say
[1:23:31] something that
[1:23:33] really is for us all but i i hope that
[1:23:36] all the teenagers are listening and i
[1:23:38] got teenagers that aren't here tonight
[1:23:40] that i so wish they were
[1:23:42] and i hope that parents make sure they
[1:23:45] hear these words because these are these
[1:23:48] are some of the most important words
[1:23:50] i've heard in a long time now say oh
[1:23:54] don't don't the adults need it too yeah
[1:23:55] but for different reasons
[1:23:57] see teenagers the reason
[1:23:59] you both need to hear you and the and
[1:24:01] the older adults but for different
[1:24:03] reasons for you it's because you ain't
[1:24:04] live long enough to mess your life up
[1:24:07] and blow yourself all to pieces with too
[1:24:09] many mistakes so i'm trying to help you
[1:24:11] not to do that
[1:24:12] to the old head adults who have done
[1:24:14] that uh too many times you know you need
[1:24:17] unique deliverance from those things
[1:24:20] so i i
[1:24:21] and and this is one of the most profound
[1:24:23] things i've heard in a while i was
[1:24:24] listening to a sermon by brother paul
[1:24:26] lafontaine one of my favorite preachers
[1:24:28] in the global earth and i got uh brother
[1:24:31] hendricks sent me the link said hey you
[1:24:33] might like this send it to me from south
[1:24:34] africa
[1:24:36] i listened to it man i've sent it to my
[1:24:38] whole ministry team i said you guys need
[1:24:40] to hear this i heard preaching like this
[1:24:42] in so long and and and and i i was
[1:24:45] trying to think of the title but it's
[1:24:47] it's it's it's bringing your thoughts
[1:24:49] subject to the word of god
[1:24:51] bringing your thoughts subject to the
[1:24:53] word of god and brother paul goes into
[1:24:56] this breakdown where where he talks
[1:24:59] about how that the real threat
[1:25:02] you know whatever the manifestation is
[1:25:06] what whatever is is is in front of you
[1:25:08] that's whether it's a doctrine or a
[1:25:10] slight of man or a cunning craftiness
[1:25:12] whereby they lie and wait to deceive or
[1:25:14] or or whether it's just a devil speaking
[1:25:19] to your mind
[1:25:23] that it could just be that you got me i
[1:25:25] got your attention
[1:25:27] where it might just be
[1:25:29] a spirit
[1:25:31] talking to your mind but brother paul
[1:25:34] made this nuclear point that's short and
[1:25:37] sweet but blew me away
[1:25:39] he said remember
[1:25:41] that every thought from satan to your
[1:25:44] mind
[1:25:45] has a plan behind it
[1:25:49] don't just think oh that's a bad thought
[1:25:52] satan didn't just go oh let me see if i
[1:25:55] can get him uh come up with something
[1:25:56] okay how about i put this thought in in
[1:25:58] that young lady's mind he's got a plan
[1:26:00] behind that
[1:26:02] don't don't think it's just him walking
[1:26:03] around whispering to everybody
[1:26:06] no he actually studies you he's got a
[1:26:08] file with your name on it he has watched
[1:26:11] you from the day you were born he knows
[1:26:12] your weaknesses he knows where this is
[1:26:14] this is us all adults too
[1:26:16] amen he knows us all and just remember
[1:26:20] this that when he brings a thought to
[1:26:22] your mind
[1:26:24] there is a plan he has a plan behind
[1:26:28] that and you know what his plan is to
[1:26:31] toss you
[1:26:34] he's looking to
[1:26:36] toss you
[1:26:38] see
[1:26:38] so it's so so it's not as simple as
[1:26:41] identifying a doctrine or identifying a
[1:26:43] man or identifying somebody did this to
[1:26:46] me or some scheme that you need to avoid
[1:26:49] it's it's it's more than that it's the
[1:26:52] supernatural plan of the devil being
[1:26:56] carried out to toss you
[1:27:01] the word tossed tossed to and fro
[1:27:04] it means to surge it means to be tossed
[1:27:07] in billows
[1:27:09] metaphorically to fluctuate see
[1:27:13] let's go to uh looks like slide 12.
[1:27:18] as the heart pantheth after the water
[1:27:21] brooks this is a deer
[1:27:23] as the deer pantheth after the water
[1:27:25] brooks
[1:27:26] so panteth my soul after thee o god
[1:27:30] my soul thirsteth for god
[1:27:33] for the living god
[1:27:35] when shall i come and appear before my
[1:27:38] god my tears have been my meat not david
[1:27:41] had transgressed god's word
[1:27:44] david had not do you know when when when
[1:27:48] david starts talking about i thought on
[1:27:49] my ways
[1:27:51] brother branham goes down i love how
[1:27:52] brother brown describes it take a profit
[1:27:54] to know the heart of david you didn't
[1:27:56] know a 20th century prophet could
[1:27:57] discern the heart of a king thousands of
[1:27:59] years ago did you
[1:28:02] but brother rahm said see when david
[1:28:04] wrote those words
[1:28:06] i thought on my ways
[1:28:08] he said
[1:28:09] david was sitting there thinking about
[1:28:11] all the promises he'd made to god and
[1:28:14] hadn't kept him
[1:28:16] and it bothered him
[1:28:18] it bothered him
[1:28:20] and he was weeping and he was crying he
[1:28:22] thought about i made him this promise i
[1:28:24] never kept it i made him this promise
[1:28:25] and i i'm such a slacker i've never i
[1:28:28] never followed through i got so anointed
[1:28:31] when i was in the temple when i was at
[1:28:33] church in the preaching i felt so
[1:28:34] determined god i promise you i'm going
[1:28:37] to stop this i'm going to get rid of
[1:28:38] that i'm going to make this change in my
[1:28:39] life and david said i thought on my ways
[1:28:41] and what he thought about was all the
[1:28:43] tribes he'd made god a promise and never
[1:28:45] kept those promises
[1:28:47] now here he finds himself sin
[1:28:49] and iniquity
[1:28:51] terrible
[1:28:52] debauchery and now he's pleading with
[1:28:55] god please help me
[1:28:57] please help me
[1:28:58] my tears have been my meat day and night
[1:29:01] while they continually say to me where
[1:29:04] is thy god
[1:29:06] when i remember these things
[1:29:08] i pour out my soul in me for i had gone
[1:29:12] with the multitude i went with them to
[1:29:14] the house of god with the voice of joy
[1:29:17] and praise with a multitude that kept
[1:29:19] holy day slight 13
[1:29:22] why art thou cast down on my soul so he
[1:29:25] even tried to go to church to shake it
[1:29:27] off he tried to go around all the
[1:29:29] believers who were living in victory and
[1:29:31] they were worshiping god and he tried to
[1:29:33] just pump himself up you know church
[1:29:36] isn't just a pep rally friends
[1:29:40] judgment begins at the house of god
[1:29:42] we've got plenty to be excited about but
[1:29:44] i'm going to tell you something judgment
[1:29:46] begins at the house of god
[1:29:50] and it wasn't working i went to church i
[1:29:53] i hung out with the people praising god
[1:29:56] they went on holy day why art thou cast
[1:29:58] down all my soul
[1:30:00] and why art thou disquieted in me hold
[1:30:03] down god
[1:30:05] for he's he's literally trying to pick
[1:30:07] himself up by his own bootstraps
[1:30:10] hope thou in god
[1:30:13] oh when i
[1:30:14] he says so
[1:30:18] hope thou in god for i shall yet praise
[1:30:21] him for the help of his countenance oh
[1:30:23] my god now look at him he goes back
[1:30:25] again oh my god my soul
[1:30:29] is cast down within me
[1:30:31] therefore will i remember thee from the
[1:30:34] land of jordan
[1:30:36] and of the hermenites from the hill
[1:30:38] mazar deep
[1:30:40] calleth unto deep at the noise of thy
[1:30:44] waterspouts all thy waves and thy
[1:30:48] billows
[1:30:49] are gone over me
[1:30:53] slide 14 jonah comes here
[1:30:57] these billows we'll tell you something
[1:30:59] friends we have billows in life
[1:31:03] then jonah prayed until the lord is god
[1:31:06] out of the fish's belly that's a pretty
[1:31:08] amazing place to be
[1:31:11] he prayed unto the lord his god out of
[1:31:14] the fish's belly and said i cried by
[1:31:18] reason of my affliction unto the lord
[1:31:20] and he heard me
[1:31:21] out of the belly of hell cried i
[1:31:25] and thou heardest my voice
[1:31:27] for thou hast cast me into the deep
[1:31:31] in the midst of the seas and the floods
[1:31:34] compass me about all thy billows there
[1:31:38] it is again all thy billows and thy
[1:31:41] waves passed over me
[1:31:44] he's being honest in his confession to
[1:31:46] the people
[1:31:48] job isn't
[1:31:50] pulling punches or sparing himself tough
[1:31:52] language
[1:31:53] he had he had he had found himself
[1:31:57] you know resistant to god's will
[1:32:00] he had found himself when you read it in
[1:32:02] the bible i'm so thankful for election
[1:32:05] you read it in the bible how that god
[1:32:06] told him to do this and he ends up
[1:32:08] looking like to me when i read the bible
[1:32:10] looks like he did the opposite
[1:32:12] so much so that that that he ends up in
[1:32:15] the belly of a whale just so that he can
[1:32:17] go ahead and obey god's will don't have
[1:32:19] to get in the belly of a whale to obey
[1:32:21] god's will
[1:32:22] see brother graham said no he said he
[1:32:24] his footsteps are ordered of god he
[1:32:26] couldn't have been out of god's will god
[1:32:28] wanted to do it this way but the bottom
[1:32:30] line is job is in the belly of a whale
[1:32:32] crying out in repentance i turned his
[1:32:35] face toward the temple and prayed god
[1:32:37] help me
[1:32:38] god help me
[1:32:40] all the floods compassed me about all
[1:32:43] thy billows and thy waves passed over me
[1:32:47] slide 15 brother brad
[1:32:52] that's a lonely place
[1:32:55] i've read the account of people lost at
[1:32:57] sea
[1:32:59] carried about on the billows they might
[1:33:01] be in a raft they might have a life
[1:33:02] jacket they might i read the story of a
[1:33:05] man one time was in the ocean for two i
[1:33:07] think almost two days and he had nothing
[1:33:09] just trying to tread water
[1:33:10] trying not to drown
[1:33:12] when you're trying to save your life
[1:33:14] your endurance can be pretty amazing
[1:33:18] it's a lonely spot to be there
[1:33:20] and that's where a lot of people live
[1:33:23] and the sad that's what the earth is
[1:33:25] right now
[1:33:27] and the sad reality is god has too many
[1:33:29] of his kingdom children
[1:33:31] dog pets treading water in that
[1:33:36] trying to make sense of why is my life
[1:33:39] so tossed
[1:33:41] why is this happening and why is that
[1:33:43] happening his billows are going over me
[1:33:48] i don't know if you've ever heard
[1:33:51] of the of the um it's called the kelvin
[1:33:54] helmholtz instability experiment
[1:33:58] now go ahead and pull up that first
[1:34:01] video and we're going to play that it's
[1:34:03] in its entirety it has no sound so you
[1:34:05] don't have to worry the other one we
[1:34:06] have time markers for
[1:34:08] but just pull it up and stop it just
[1:34:11] because i want to explain
[1:34:12] what this is demonstrating this is an
[1:34:14] instability experiment it's called
[1:34:16] kelvin helmholtz instability experiment
[1:34:20] now
[1:34:22] i'll try to explain it to you as best i
[1:34:24] can as best as i understand it
[1:34:27] so they're going to deal
[1:34:30] with
[1:34:31] the effect of sheer
[1:34:33] over water now there's all kinds of
[1:34:35] sheer that we can talk about wind shear
[1:34:37] we could have brother john uh phelan
[1:34:39] come here and give us a breakdown on
[1:34:41] microburst and wind shear that pilots
[1:34:43] have to worry about and that's because
[1:34:45] you can have you know up and down drafts
[1:34:47] adjacent to one another and you know a
[1:34:49] plane coming in for a landing can fly
[1:34:52] into that down or fly into an up and and
[1:34:55] many of them have crashed with
[1:34:56] microburst that's until doppler radar
[1:34:59] was put in they a lot of planes went
[1:35:02] down over microburst that that happened
[1:35:04] to hit right at a runway
[1:35:06] and i i was landing one time and a plane
[1:35:09] had ju all the ground was still charred
[1:35:11] in black it had just crashed the week
[1:35:13] before and killed a bunch of people in
[1:35:14] charlotte
[1:35:16] and you could even see where it went
[1:35:17] through the fence and burned up all the
[1:35:19] trees and everything and it was a
[1:35:20] microburst right at the end of the
[1:35:21] runway they didn't have doppler
[1:35:23] installed they couldn't see it
[1:35:24] and when it hit when it's a microburst
[1:35:26] is a downward hard wind and it hits and
[1:35:29] goes out like that
[1:35:30] and so when a plane's coming in it
[1:35:32] catches that up when he's coming in for
[1:35:33] a landing and it lifts him up so you
[1:35:35] know what he does oh i got to get landed
[1:35:37] he
[1:35:37] pulls back power i got to cut power well
[1:35:40] he don't realize that he's going to fly
[1:35:42] into the downburst and then his engines
[1:35:44] aren't going to spool up fast enough
[1:35:46] he'll push it all the way the firewall
[1:35:47] it won't matter his wings will stop
[1:35:49] flying and he'll crash
[1:35:51] and so that pilots are trained that when
[1:35:53] you hit when you hit shear like that
[1:35:55] give it the gas do a go around don't
[1:35:58] don't pull the throttle back
[1:36:00] see but that that's a that's a that's
[1:36:02] that it's amazing what windshield can do
[1:36:04] i was looking at some instruction things
[1:36:06] today it was incredible what pilots have
[1:36:08] to face all the things they have to
[1:36:10] learn about the
[1:36:12] properties of wind and change and
[1:36:14] direction and
[1:36:15] but as it relates to sheer over the top
[1:36:18] of water
[1:36:19] that
[1:36:20] what you basically have you say what
[1:36:22] causes all of those billows that i
[1:36:25] showed you what why do you drive across
[1:36:27] the river and you see all these white
[1:36:28] caps on a windy day
[1:36:30] because what what's happening is is the
[1:36:33] wind is moving quickly over the water in
[1:36:37] this direction but the water is going
[1:36:39] this way and it's moving slow and
[1:36:42] and that in the middle is sheer it
[1:36:45] creates shear and creates those billows
[1:36:47] and those white caps you understand and
[1:36:50] so they're they're they're showing in
[1:36:52] this experiment what they're going to do
[1:36:54] is
[1:36:55] they're going to take salt water and
[1:36:57] they're going to put it in a tank a long
[1:36:59] tank about looks like about 12 foot long
[1:37:01] in the first one about six foot long in
[1:37:03] the next one second one
[1:37:04] and in the bottom they actually are
[1:37:06] going to put some coloring in it
[1:37:08] and it's going to be salt water because
[1:37:10] salt water is heavier than fresh water
[1:37:12] and and then and then on top of the salt
[1:37:14] water they're going to put fresh water
[1:37:17] uh i hope i don't have that backwards i
[1:37:19] do have it backwards yeah the
[1:37:20] freshwater's
[1:37:21] sinks to the bottom and the salt water
[1:37:23] stays above and so what ends up
[1:37:26] happening they they color the regular
[1:37:29] water and then they put clear
[1:37:32] uh water in on top of that
[1:37:34] and what ends up happening everything is
[1:37:36] separated and the the the line if you
[1:37:39] imagine when you see this all you got to
[1:37:41] do is see this
[1:37:42] you'll see the line of separation very
[1:37:44] clear it's crystal clear the line
[1:37:47] between the fresh and the salt water
[1:37:49] and everything's fine
[1:37:51] until they tilt it
[1:37:53] like life can do to you sometimes
[1:37:56] and what ends up happening is when you
[1:37:58] tilt it the heavier water wants to go
[1:38:00] one way and the lighter water wants to
[1:38:02] go another way the water above is trying
[1:38:05] to go one direction because it's light
[1:38:07] it's trying to go up and the heavier
[1:38:09] water is trying to go down and and that
[1:38:12] line in the middle is is where shear
[1:38:14] gets created and that's where you
[1:38:18] live
[1:38:20] because above you is a vision of god
[1:38:24] god has a vision for your life now pay
[1:38:26] close attention
[1:38:28] but you also have a vision for your life
[1:38:31] yourself
[1:38:32] and everything can be fine as long as
[1:38:35] they're moving in the same direction
[1:38:38] at the same speed that god wants you
[1:38:41] moving amen
[1:38:43] the problem that happens in people's
[1:38:45] lives is god has one vision above which
[1:38:49] is going in a one direction and you have
[1:38:51] made a decision to take your life here
[1:38:53] below in another direction and that
[1:38:56] creates sheer
[1:38:58] and it brings billows
[1:39:01] you can see it in cloud formations you
[1:39:03] can see it in van gogh painted it in a
[1:39:04] famous painting
[1:39:06] it's called it's called it's what
[1:39:08] creates billows in the atmosphere it's
[1:39:10] what creates billows and cloud
[1:39:11] formations you'll see them sometimes and
[1:39:13] that's that's upper and lower currents
[1:39:15] doing like that instead of instead of
[1:39:17] going like this you got them going like
[1:39:19] that
[1:39:20] and this is god's plan for you to go
[1:39:22] this way and he's got a certain speed
[1:39:24] but you
[1:39:25] even even if you're going his way you
[1:39:27] might be going too slow and he's trying
[1:39:28] to get you to go this way and and but
[1:39:31] what happens a lot of times is god wants
[1:39:32] you to go like this and you want to go
[1:39:34] like that and you wonder why the billows
[1:39:36] strike your life you're about to see
[1:39:38] your life you're about to see what
[1:39:40] happens to your life
[1:39:42] when you do that
[1:39:44] make sure we've got a full screen and go
[1:39:46] ahead and start it
[1:39:49] this is the calvin helmholtz instability
[1:39:52] demonstration
[1:39:54] fresh water versus salt water
[1:39:57] all right now just watch
[1:40:02] there's the heavier water on the bottom
[1:40:05] lighter water on the top now he tilts it
[1:40:07] the lighter water wants to go uphill the
[1:40:09] heavier water wants to go downhill now
[1:40:12] watch what happens to your life
[1:40:19] that's you
[1:40:20] now they're going to zoom in you think
[1:40:22] your life is fine you're going you're
[1:40:24] just working a job that's all you're
[1:40:26] doing you're just living a life you're
[1:40:28] just you you don't realize there's sheer
[1:40:30] between your will and god's will and you
[1:40:33] think everything is fine
[1:40:35] until it's not and your life does that
[1:40:40] and david is saying thy billows have
[1:40:43] gone over me you know why because god's
[1:40:46] life wanted to go like this for david
[1:40:48] david's life wouldn't go like that and
[1:40:50] he ends up with billows
[1:40:52] there there's the demonstration
[1:40:53] continuing
[1:40:55] that's what happened to jonah that's
[1:40:57] what happens to me that's what happens
[1:40:59] to you
[1:41:01] now go ahead and i mean that look at the
[1:41:03] turbulence
[1:41:04] that's your life and people wonder why
[1:41:07] is so much wrong in my life
[1:41:11] here's a perfect demonstration let's go
[1:41:13] to the next one
[1:41:15] this one's a little bit longer about two
[1:41:17] minutes long
[1:41:18] and uh it's got some some sound which
[1:41:20] you can go ahead and play the sound from
[1:41:22] the two minute mark if you wish
[1:41:29] below the fresh water when the layers
[1:41:31] have settled here's our scientists kind
[1:41:33] of creating her experience
[1:41:34] if we don't have sound it's okay it's
[1:41:36] fine it's fine it's fine now watch the
[1:41:37] sun
[1:41:38] that way and the fresh water that way
[1:41:42] and there's our effect in tank one look
[1:41:44] at that that happens to two minutes
[1:41:50] that's what happens watch this
[1:41:52] watch it again
[1:41:54] look at that you can't stop it you say
[1:41:57] does god hate me
[1:41:59] why are so many things this isn't fair
[1:42:01] why so many things happening to me it's
[1:42:03] because god has a direction for you and
[1:42:05] you've got an opposite one
[1:42:08] and your life does that now they're
[1:42:11] gonna go here in a minute and they're
[1:42:12] gonna they're gonna draw it in slowly
[1:42:14] they'll just keep showing you
[1:42:15] demonstrations
[1:42:18] and then they're gonna bring it in
[1:42:19] they're gonna slow it down and they're
[1:42:21] gonna bring it in real close
[1:42:23] and i want you to notice here we go
[1:42:26] oh my life is good what's wrong what why
[1:42:29] is things turning bad oh it'll get
[1:42:31] better tomorrow no it's worse tomorrow

[1:42:35] will help me lord why aren't you helping
[1:42:37] me

[1:42:40] than that my goodness okay everything
[1:42:42] will be all right tomorrow uh oh no it's
[1:42:45] not getting any better what's wrong oh
[1:42:48] god
[1:42:51] must be the preacher's fault must be the
[1:42:53] deacon's fault it must be my spouse's
[1:42:55] fault
[1:42:58] that's got to be what it is it's my
[1:42:59] spouse's fault
[1:43:01] if my spouse would just do things the
[1:43:03] way i want to do them we wouldn't have
[1:43:04] this turmoil in our bills we wouldn't
[1:43:07] have this turmoil in our health we
[1:43:09] wouldn't have this turmoil in our
[1:43:10] children we wouldn't have this turmoil
[1:43:12] in our relationship

[1:43:22] that you've got to go in the kingdom
[1:43:24] direction because if you don't this will

[1:45:02] you are causing the turmoil or if you're
[1:45:06] just languishing failing to make
[1:45:08] progress there's some of you here that
[1:45:10] god has been calling for more from you
[1:45:13] for a long time and you're some of you
[1:45:16] are just moving at such a snail's pace
[1:45:19] you're you're you're living the bare
[1:45:21] minimums of spirituality i'm here to

[1:45:35] in rhythm with the timing

[1:45:47] if you're not making enough progress
[1:45:49] billows are brought on by you
[1:45:55] god is not punishing you
[1:45:57] get that don't don't think brother jason
[1:45:59] is saying
[1:46:00] oh you're such a bad boy god is
[1:46:03] punishing you he's not punishing you at
[1:46:05] all
[1:46:07] this is a fact of the physical universe
[1:46:09] when god's got a one direction plan and
[1:46:11] you're trying to go in the other or he's
[1:46:13] got a speed for your life and you're not
[1:46:14] keeping up
[1:46:15] when wind goes across water and the
[1:46:17] water won't keep up billows
[1:46:20] if wind comes in and water's going the
[1:46:22] other way shear gets created billows
[1:46:26] god's not punishing you in fact his god
[1:46:28] is acting in faithfulness oh friends
[1:46:31] could i give you that love message from
[1:46:33] the lord jesus tonight he's not
[1:46:35] punishing you
[1:46:37] he he's he's he's he's actually acting
[1:46:40] in faithfulness to you
[1:46:42] by causing by allowing these billows
[1:46:45] in your life
[1:46:48] i read that where it said
[1:46:50] for thou this is jonah
[1:46:54] for thou has cast me
[1:46:56] into the deep
[1:46:58] in the midst of the seas and the floods
[1:47:00] compassed me
[1:47:02] all thy billows and thy waves passed
[1:47:05] over me
[1:47:07] jonah realized
[1:47:10] god had thrown him overboard
[1:47:14] not the ship's crew
[1:47:16] it wasn't his shipmates that threw him
[1:47:18] over
[1:47:19] god threw him
[1:47:20] over he allowed men to do it you read
[1:47:23] the narrative they oh we don't want to
[1:47:24] do that jokes jonah said you got to do
[1:47:26] it or you're going down and so they
[1:47:27] finally as a last resort they picked up
[1:47:29] jonah and bound him up and tied him and
[1:47:32] threw him they didn't throw him at all
[1:47:35] they were only instruments
[1:47:37] of god
[1:47:39] god
[1:47:40] that's what jonah caught when jonah got
[1:47:43] humble enough to repent
[1:47:46] he realized
[1:47:47] god threw me over
[1:47:49] it wasn't my shipmates after all god
[1:47:51] threw me over
[1:47:53] it was god
[1:47:55] acting
[1:47:56] in faithfulness
[1:47:58] to his son
[1:48:03] you know where we are now
[1:48:05] now
[1:48:07] now we're back full circle now we're
[1:48:09] back to hebrews 12.
[1:48:12] whose voice then shook the earth
[1:48:15] but now he hath promised saying yet once
[1:48:18] more
[1:48:19] i shake not the earth only
[1:48:21] but i'm also going to shake jason
[1:48:26] i'm going to shake all these families
[1:48:28] i'm going to shake heaven and earth i'm
[1:48:31] going to shake pastors i'm going to
[1:48:32] shake officers i'm going to shake
[1:48:35] leaders i'm going to shake families i'm
[1:48:37] going to shake teenagers
[1:48:39] i'm why am i doing it so that i so so
[1:48:43] that i can remove all the loose things
[1:48:46] in their lives see
[1:48:48] this is why a prophet comes and
[1:48:50] identifies hebrews 12 because now we
[1:48:52] have a prophet calling out to the last
[1:48:54] age that what's happening the removing
[1:48:57] what's happening what's happening pastor
[1:48:59] it's the removing of those things that
[1:49:01] are shaken the removing of the loose
[1:49:04] things in our lives why that those
[1:49:07] things which cannot be shaken may remain
[1:49:12] and i just say lord whatever's left of
[1:49:14] me let it just be your pure word
[1:49:17] let my whole life be shaken to pieces
[1:49:19] and now i i know that you'll shake
[1:49:21] whatever i won't lay down you'll shake
[1:49:23] whatever i won't give up you'll shake it
[1:49:25] out of my life you'll cause billows
[1:49:27] it'll create wind shear but i know when
[1:49:29] i'm done hallelujah i'll be in your
[1:49:32] perfect image
[1:49:33] [Applause]
[1:49:34] oh my precious friends
[1:49:37] so you see
[1:49:39] when the heavenly father sees you still
[1:49:42] so easily unsettled in your mind
[1:49:46] when he sees you still so unsettled in
[1:49:49] your maturity unsettled in your
[1:49:51] spiritual growth just know this you know
[1:49:54] that brother jason told you if you go
[1:49:55] home tonight remember brother jason told
[1:49:57] you
[1:49:59] if god sees that in you
[1:50:01] just know
[1:50:03] he's going to keep shaking
[1:50:06] you're not going to get out of it
[1:50:08] he's going to keep shaking
[1:50:11] the power of god
[1:50:14] behind the coming kingdom is here
[1:50:18] today
[1:50:19] it's moving in real time it's all
[1:50:23] preparation to make us
[1:50:26] unmovable
[1:50:27] in that kingdom
[1:50:30] that's how i
[1:50:31] want to be
[1:50:33] to make you why is he doing it pastor to
[1:50:36] make you unmovable
[1:50:40] say
[1:50:41] well if you only knew what i'd been
[1:50:43] through please
[1:50:45] you haven't yet suffered under blood
[1:50:47] give me a break
[1:50:49] you think you've suffered like paul did
[1:50:51] really you think you've suffered like
[1:50:53] jesus did who endured such contradiction
[1:50:56] of sinners against himself yet never
[1:50:58] opened his mouth went to the slaughter
[1:51:00] like a lamb
[1:51:02] you you think you've endured what the
[1:51:04] martyrs endured
[1:51:05] have your family slaughtered in front of
[1:51:07] you
[1:51:10] and yet they kept keeping on
[1:51:12] they kept loving god they kept going
[1:51:15] forward
[1:51:16] paul says here in acts chapter 20. i'll
[1:51:19] read you this and we'll we'll stop
[1:51:23] serving the lord with all humility of
[1:51:25] mind
[1:51:28] and with many tears and temptations
[1:51:32] which befell me
[1:51:33] by the lying and weight of the jews
[1:51:36] and how i kept back nothing that was
[1:51:39] unprofitable to you but have showed you
[1:51:41] and have taught you publicly and from
[1:51:44] house to house
[1:51:46] testifying both to the jews and also to
[1:51:48] the greeks repentance toward god and
[1:51:50] faith toward our lord jesus christ and
[1:51:52] now
[1:51:53] here comes paul to the end of his life
[1:51:55] friends
[1:51:56] here he's coming now it won't be long
[1:51:58] he's going to write timothy a
[1:52:00] heartbreaking letter and he's going to
[1:52:02] say the time of my disillusion is here
[1:52:05] i've i've run a good race i've fought a
[1:52:07] good fight i finished my course
[1:52:10] and there's laid up a crown for me
[1:52:13] he says here to these ephesians
[1:52:16] and now
[1:52:18] behold i go bound in the spirit unto
[1:52:21] jerusalem not knowing the things that
[1:52:23] shall befall me there
[1:52:25] save that the holy ghost witnesseth in
[1:52:27] every city saying that bonds and
[1:52:29] afflictions abide me
[1:52:34] but none of these things move me
[1:52:39] say lord
[1:52:41] whatever the devil could throw at me
[1:52:43] whatever life could throw at me whatever
[1:52:45] it's my fault somebody else's fault who
[1:52:46] cares whatever lord it's you you threw
[1:52:48] me off a ship i got swallowed by a whale
[1:52:51] whatever it was lord
[1:52:54] i want to get to a point where
[1:52:56] i am so shaken by god that i'm
[1:52:59] unshakeable
[1:53:00] and where i can say no matter what
[1:53:02] happens to me no matter who does this no
[1:53:04] matter what happens in my life no matter
[1:53:06] what my
[1:53:07] spouse says to me no matter what my
[1:53:09] children say to me no matter what a
[1:53:10] church does to me no matter what happens
