[20:18] he serving the lord for a few years
[20:22] and I remember hearing this song so many
[20:26] times finally one day I just said wonder
[20:28] what that means wonder what Bula
[20:31] means and so I looked it up and I think
[20:35] I was more confused after I read what it
[20:37] meant then when I didn't know what it
[20:40] actually meant if you look in Wikipedia
[20:45] in Hebrew it means that you're married
[20:48] to the
[20:49] land and if you apply that to the land
[20:53] that the people of Israel will marry the
[20:56] land of bua is referred to in various
[21:00] hymns for for that I thought okay so
[21:04] we're married to a land and then if you
[21:08] look in Isaiah
[21:10] 62:4 it says Bula means married and is
[21:14] applied to the land of the people of
[21:16] Israel but Thou shalt be called heev
[21:20] zeah and thy land Bula for the Lord
[21:24] delighteth in thee and thy land shall be
[21:27] married
[21:28] aren't you glad that the Lord Delights
[21:30] in you amen doesn't that just kind of

[31:38] 19 16-
[31:45] 26 and behold one came and said unto him
[31:48] good Master what good thing shall I do
[31:52] that I may have eternal
[31:54] life and he said unto him why callest
[31:56] thou me good there is none good but one
[32:00] that is God but if thou Wilt enter into
[32:03] life keep the
[32:05] Commandments he saith unto him which
[32:09] Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou
[32:11] shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not
[32:14] steal Thou shalt not bear false witness
[32:17] honor thy father and thy mother and thou
[32:20] shalt love thy neighbor as
[32:23] thyself the young man said unto him all
[32:26] these things have I kept from my youth
[32:29] up what lack I
[32:31] yet Jesus said unto him if thou wil be
[32:35] perfect go and sell that thou Hast and
[32:38] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[32:41] treasure in heaven and come and follow
[32:45] me but when the young man heard that
[32:48] saying he went away sorrowful for he had
[32:51] great
[32:52] possessions then said Jesus unto his
[32:54] disciples verily I say unto you
[32:57] that a rich man shall hardly enter into
[33:00] the kingdom of heaven and again I say
[33:03] unto you it is easier for a camel to go
[33:06] through the eye of a needle than for a
[33:08] rich man to enter into the kingdom of
[33:11] God when his disciples heard it they
[33:14] were exceedingly amazed saying who can
[33:18] be sa who then can be
[33:20] saved but Jesus beheld them and said
[33:24] unto them with men this is impossible
[33:27] possible but With God all things are
[33:31] possible hallelujah amen you love the
[33:35] Lord this morning let's let's

[34:01] instruction reprove us and even rebuke
[34:04] us where we might need that Above All
[34:07] Things We Come Today a little closer to
[34:10] the image that you saw of us before the
[34:13] foundation of the world may that be the
[34:16] result of this day's service we commit

[34:59] God
[35:00] amen amen praise the Lord the
[35:04] improbable
[35:05] implausible and impossible word of God
[35:10] Jesus really had astonished his
[35:14] disciples with you know with his
[35:17] comments from a real life event this was
[35:20] not just a parable this was actually a
[35:23] historical event there was a young man
[35:27] Who had who was what we might call today
[35:31] uh we might say a fine young man that
[35:34] that was a fine young man uh Mark
[35:37] records the same story in the 10th
[35:39] chapter Luke records the same story in
[35:42] the 18th chapter it's very important
[35:44] story and brother brandham picks up this
[35:47] Rich he calls him the Rich Young Ruler
[35:51] and it's significant because later on we
[35:55] find that
[35:57] Jesus looking forward sees that this
[36:00] young man someday that he will stand on
[36:04] his rooftop and he will Overlook his
[36:07] vast wealth and he will determine that
[36:11] his wealth is so great and his ambition
[36:14] is so great and his future plans are so
[36:17] great that his barns aren't going to be
[36:20] big enough and he's going to need to
[36:23] completely tear down his Barns and silos
[36:26] and all of his warehouses and rebuild
[36:29] them much bigger and you know and that's
[36:32] not an uncommon thing and I don't even
[36:35] necessarily say that you know you you
[36:37] you always want to accomplish all that
[36:39] you can that's not really the issue it's
[36:42] just who do you want to accomplish it
[36:43] for and what's the real motive behind
[36:46] your desire to accomplish there we're
[36:49] going to accomplish things as brother
[36:51] Jason uh dears was teaching us this
[36:54] morning that world that's coming friends
[36:56] is is going to be Beyond description I
[36:58] mean we can stand here and try to
[37:00] describe it and we can use superlatives
[37:03] and descriptive terms and and we can go
[37:06] back and brother brandham can talk about
[37:07] what it's going to be and we can we've
[37:09] actually i' I've preached sermons that
[37:11] chart the acreage alone you know uh of
[37:15] of just the of just the Holy Mountain
[37:19] where the new city that comes down upon
[37:22] it and I mean you're you're talking you
[37:24] know about millions and billions of
[37:27] acres and uh that that spread out across
[37:30] the world and it's going to be more than
[37:32] just sitting on a cloud playing a heart
[37:34] brother Brenham says we're going to live
[37:36] we're going to life it's going to be a
[37:39] fantastic time uh and so there's nothing
[37:43] wrong with you know thinking large and
[37:47] and I think large all the time but I
[37:50] want to say like Jesus you know what's
[37:54] what's my real motive and what's my real
[37:56] objective am I laying up treasure for
[37:58] this side on that's foolish because you
[38:03] can't take it with you and and he saids
[38:06] Jesus reasoned to say human reasoning
[38:10] mind you that don't even don't even you
[38:14] know put a lot of effort into laying up
[38:17] treasure here where thieves and moth and
[38:20] rust can just take it all away from you
[38:23] uh but lay up Treasures on the other
[38:25] side where
[38:27] thieves
[38:30] aren't where moth and rust don't corrupt
[38:33] anything see and so it's it's just it it
[38:37] becomes common sense to do it that way
[38:41] but I I'm going to suggest you today
[38:44] that it's a common sense that's
[38:47] otherworldly it's not a a what we would
[38:50] call human reasoning you know the the
[38:53] the human reasoning looks at the
[38:55] Christian and with all all of his
[38:57] principles like the ones I just laid out
[38:59] about layup Treasures on the other side
[39:02] you know and things like her enemies I
[39:06] mean that was so anathema to Jews who
[39:09] had been taught their whole life an eye
[39:11] for an eye and a tooth for a tooth Jesus
[39:14] was unorthodox as unorthodox could be
[39:17] and so he was uh he was Radical he was
[39:20] an itinerant he was Radical itinerant
[39:24] and and they you know everything that he
[39:27] that he talked about you know was
[39:29] contrary to what the religious
[39:32] hierarchy of Israel wanted at that time
[39:35] and for that reason they were against
[39:37] him and for that same reason religious
[39:40] hierarchy is against the word of God
[39:42] today and will recommend I mean
[39:45] religious hierarchy of human reasoning
[39:48] of the world today Rec recommends that
[39:51] we don't operate this way yeah
[39:55] recommends to me
[39:57] he Don't Preach against those things you
[39:59] could have a larger crowd you know go
[40:02] ahead and let and let's make a let's
[40:05] let's turn it from a from a sacred
[40:08] sanctuary in into a into a you know a an
[40:12] auditorium of of not just sacred worship
[40:16] but an auditorium of
[40:18] entertainment that's what the world you
[40:20] know it's all about numbers and brother
[40:22] brandom said they were doing that you
[40:24] know way back in his day a million more
[40:26] 44 and it was always the goal and but a
[40:30] little casual search of History finds
[40:33] out that as soon as the church back in
[40:35] the early days started letting down the
[40:38] bars sheep got out goats got in and the
[40:42] church got corrupted oh yeah amen that
[40:45] happens in
[40:47] homes that happens in lives you lower
[40:51] the bars and what happens the holy you
[40:54] know the Holy Spirit ends up going away
[40:57] offended because you've let too many
[40:59] things of the world into your life under
[41:02] your roof in your family you your your
[41:04] priorities get
[41:07] S see go ahead destroy yourself and your
[41:11] loved
[41:13] one because that's going to be you say
[41:16] well well you know they might could make
[41:18] it big to what
[41:22] end to what end are you going to make it
[41:25] big to do what once you make it then
[41:29] afraid and live in fear to have to try
[41:31] to keep
[41:33] it what do they have you know I mean I'm
[41:36] not I don't want to go down a rabbit
[41:38] trail of it today but I've preached on
[41:40] it before and and and um I mean listen
[41:44] you know we we've talked about we put a
[41:46] blocks of life and showed you know just
[41:48] it was such a a visual image to just
[41:51] show 80 years in
[41:54] blocks and how far down the list you
[41:56] already are I mean you know if we if we
[42:00] take the promised years I'll give you a
[42:02] shock are you ready I promise you it's
[42:04] going to astonish you I've never said it
[42:06] to anyone that it didn't go
[42:08] wow it did that to me we we talk about
[42:12] the promised
[42:14] years and we talk about you know 70
[42:17] years the promised 70 we call it now
[42:20] some people thank god sister Jean is 13
[42:22] years past that see brother Eddie made
[42:24] it past that many 16-year-old don't get
[42:27] a fourth of that amen who pass away so
[42:31] life is uncertain you don't know that
[42:32] you might be here today but not here
[42:35] tomorrow it could happen in a moment you
[42:37] know there even young athletes in their
[42:40] Prime I mean how how many how many we
[42:43] could go down the list of world famous
[42:46] uh world class athletes in their 20s fit
[42:50] that's an understatement and on a on a
[42:53] on a on a soccer pitch fall over dead on
[42:56] a football field fall down dead in a
[42:58] boxing ring what you know running riding
[43:00] a bicycle just fall over
[43:03] dead here we have no continuing City but
[43:07] I do seek one to come I do want to
[43:10] continue I'd very much like to
[43:13] continue you know as brother Jason was
[43:15] saying this morning Life is Beautiful
[43:17] the world is a beautiful place I I said
[43:20] to you some time ago people could say
[43:22] well if you if you knew what my life was
[43:24] you wouldn't say that but come on that's
[43:27] only because I get that but that's only
[43:29] because you're in that if all of that
[43:32] went away and you had no problems and
[43:34] everything was on peace and joy forever
[43:36] more Life is Beautiful the world is
[43:40] beautiful take all the sin
[43:44] away and so we we're going to a
[43:46] beautiful world we're given here you
[43:49] know 70 promised years and you know you
[43:52] say here today some of you may be in
[43:54] your teens or your 20s your 30s and 70
[43:57] look so far away I promise you it don't
[43:59] stay looking far away very
[44:03] long I remember brother Eddie used to
[44:05] say to me boy you be 30 before you know
[44:07] it he wasn't wrong and then he would
[44:10] start saying boy you be 40 before you
[44:11] know it he wasn't wrong and you know
[44:14] that even if you live I mean if we just
[44:17] use the promise
[44:20] 70 can we do that let's just call it an
[44:23] average and call it the promise 70
[44:26] you've only got 3600 weeks of
[44:28] life and you're done 3600 weeks I mean
[44:33] weeks go by like that it was this last
[44:36] week and then the week before that and
[44:38] we're already now weeks past Christmas
[44:39] and it was just a day or two
[44:42] ago if you live 70 you you've only got
[44:47] 3652 weeks of life and how many weeks
[44:50] have you already blew
[44:54] through sobering isn't it
[44:58] am so if we're going to chase something
[45:02] you know this fine young
[45:05] man this is a story of a of a fine young
[45:09] man who was who actually was interested
[45:12] in
[45:14] God and he was obviously wealthy and
[45:18] educated and upwardly mobile and
[45:20] charismatic whatever he must have had he
[45:22] must have had all the right stuff to be
[45:24] able to accomplish
[45:26] so much from such a young age he was
[45:28] already a ruler see and and we find that
[45:32] Jesus showing in that the end of his
[45:34] life in hell he lifted up his eyes yes
[45:38] amen because he as brother brandham said
[45:41] he knew he he he had he had tells he
[45:44] says to Jesus The Ten Commandments I've
[45:47] I've kept those since my youth I'm a
[45:50] fine young
[45:51] man I've been in church I understand
[45:55] right right from wrong but brother
[45:57] Brandon points out and when he when when
[45:59] the Rich Young Ruler said that Jesus
[46:01] didn't contend with that now Jesus would
[46:04] have when those Pharisees said things
[46:06] Jesus said you're a
[46:07] liar this man he didn't disagree with
[46:10] that at all but he says but if you would
[46:12] be perfect in other words and and you're
[46:14] going to have to be perfect because
[46:16] you've got to stand and marry the
[46:17] perfect Son of God so now there's no way
[46:20] you can do that all you but what you can
[46:22] do is have faith in that which can make
[46:25] you stand before God as
[46:31] perfect and a prophet points out that he
[46:34] was a good fell good guy been raised in
[46:37] church believed it was a really fine
[46:39] young man but yet even he knew that he
[46:44] was still coming up short yes of eternal
[46:48] life amen it's a it's a sobering thing
[46:52] for fine young men here today fine young
[46:55] sisters
[46:56] it doesn't you don't even have to be
[46:58] young you could be older it it's a it's
[47:01] a sobering reminder and and what Jesus
[47:04] was saying to him sounded
[47:07] implausible it sounded I mean it it it
[47:11] sounded to
[47:13] say why would I give up all of my
[47:16] hard-earned
[47:17] work see and it was simply that the
[47:20] young man did not value and so many
[47:23] times I see people come up short because
[47:27] they don't have the right value set to
[47:29] their
[47:33] priorities yeah you know
[47:36] it's leadership is a a paradoxical thing
[47:41] whether it's a a father in a home or a
[47:43] mother I mean she's the first pastor of
[47:46] the children yes amen whether it's a
[47:48] church church is just a collection of
[47:50] families amen if we want to do we want a
[47:54] spiritual church amen
[47:56] well then that's up to you I can preach
[47:58] it all day long he can anoint me and I
[48:01] can bring you the word but if you want a
[48:02] spiritual church you got to have
[48:04] spiritual families cuz a church is just
[48:07] a collection of
[48:08] families and and that and brother
[48:10] Brenham said no matter how much I
[48:13] prepare and pray and am
[48:15] anointed in the back room and you
[48:18] wouldn't even be able to guess the hours
[48:21] of preparation that go into just a
[48:23] single sermon sometimes you're thinking
[48:24] on it for days and weeks amen and and
[48:28] and studied and have it ready and be
[48:32] Anointed with the Dynamics of the Holy
[48:35] Ghost and Prophet said and walk out here
[48:38] anointed studied and prepared and the
[48:41] Holy Spirit feel resistance he just
[48:44] won't
[48:45] move he just won't move and I'm going to
[48:47] tell you something friends you're in a
[48:49] day where you can't afford to come to a
[48:50] Sunday service and not have him move we
[48:54] need him moving
[48:56] Hallelujah we need to have the Dynamics
[48:58] of the Holy Ghost it's far too late of
[49:01] an hour playing church is long ago gone
[49:04] people are perishing that's right
[49:07] crossing the line between judgment and
[49:09] mercy sealing their Doom in a
[49:11] tribulation just like this fine young
[49:13] man yeah
[49:16] amen Jesus said Jesus knew his problem
[49:20] and your problem our yours might be
[49:23] different from mine his was different
[49:24] from zakus yeah zakus was cheating
[49:28] people and uh he comes down and
[49:31] confesses I'll I'll repay he went back
[49:33] to the law I'll repay every man I think
[49:35] it was four-fold or tenfold there was
[49:37] two different laws governing that and I
[49:40] think he he was talking about the one
[49:42] that was
[49:44] four-fold uh and Jesus didn't require
[49:46] zakus to sell all that he had and follow
[49:49] him because that that zakus didn't have
[49:51] that that issue this young man had that
[49:54] issue see what is your issue today that
[49:57] the Lord is knocking on your heart and
[50:00] saying you need to let that go you you
[50:03] come I can say well well the other
[50:05] person no forget the other person this
[50:08] is
[50:09] you Paul pilate said what shall I do
[50:13] with Jesus called the Christ brother
[50:16] brandham used him in leadership there in
[50:18] Cina brother brandham you prove that
[50:22] that leadership is a Timeless principle
[50:24] transcends time came came down out of
[50:26] heaven and and brother brandham said now
[50:31] okay you had a mother you had a a father
[50:34] you a little child you had a Sunday
[50:36] school teacher you had a pastor you've
[50:39] got a school teacher you've got a
[50:42] university professor and he so you know
[50:44] he just covered the whole Gambit of
[50:46] humanity wherever they might be and he
[50:48] comes down to the final question that
[50:50] really was the the only question that
[50:51] even mattered and he said who is leading
[50:54] you now yes amen amen sobering question
[50:59] because we're all being led he said
[51:00] you're either being led from above or
[51:01] beneath there's three Realms above and
[51:04] three Realms below and you're in the
[51:05] middle and you're influenced by those
[51:07] upper or lower Realms that's a fact you
[51:10] can't go anywhere to escape that amen
[51:13] man that's that's how we live and so you
[51:16] have to make these sobering decisions
[51:18] this is my first sermon in the new year
[51:20] and I want to get it right I want you to
[51:23] know that the that this world can't just
[51:26] keep going on forever uh the age can't
[51:29] just keep going on forever he only had
[51:32] seven stars in his right hand and he's
[51:35] already deployed them there was only
[51:38] seven ages and we're already at the end
[51:40] of the last one it can't just keep going
[51:44] on it can't
[51:46] actually so what are your
[51:50] preparations you know it's leadership is
[51:53] such a a vital thing and and we see you
[51:56] know today Satan wants you to be led
[52:00] contrary to God's word Satan wants you
[52:03] to be led you know by
[52:07] leoa now the problem with that is is
[52:12] leoda has a God over it that ain't the
[52:16] God Amen it has a worshiped being an
[52:21] antichrist Spirit that's leading it so
[52:23] you just have to ask yourself this
[52:25] question do I want to be led by human
[52:28] reasoning and understanding and let leoa
[52:32] take me on you know the the Pied Piper
[52:35] take me like a rat down and drown
[52:38] Meen or or am I willing today to say
[52:42] away with the reasoning of the world I
[52:44] will take the way with the Lord's
[52:46] despised few I know it's in implausible
[52:50] I know sometimes it's it's improbable
[52:53] what God is asking me to do there's no
[52:55] way it can come out good until it
[52:59] does until it does Amen I'm here to tell
[53:02] you something friends that those people
[53:05] that live in that world you just
[53:09] remember I I when I'm standing in the
[53:11] crowd and I I can never resist people
[53:13] saying oh well you know the world is
[53:15] ending I always seem to find myself
[53:17] speaking up try to tell myself shut up
[53:19] don't say anything no just be quiet and
[53:22] I can't and I just have to say you know
[53:24] it's not
[53:26] ending they're happy to hear that
[53:29] they're like oh you must be you know
[53:31] some Guru you must be some motivational
[53:34] speaker I
[53:36] am motivate you to the most wonderful
[53:38] world ever thought of the world is not
[53:41] ending amen it's being trans it's just
[53:44] transitioning even the Millennium is not
[53:46] even the ending of time we're still
[53:49] counting times and centuries I'll still
[53:51] be alive in the 27th century amen
[53:55] amen the world just keeps right on going
[53:58] it's just that that that that Sinners
[54:00] are going to perish in self-destruction
[54:03] called Armageddon and the devil's going
[54:05] to be put in a chain of circumstance and
[54:08] the and the and the Earth is going to
[54:09] write itself because it was Atomic power
[54:12] that rocked it off of its axis Atomic
[54:15] power is going to write it back up and
[54:16] then the P the polar caps with tropical
[54:19] vegetation down under them well all
[54:21] you're talking about global warming it's
[54:23] going to be a beautiful place
[54:26] the whole world will come back in nature
[54:28] and the curse will be lifted and nature
[54:30] will function again like it used to be
[54:33] and the Saints will rebuild and that's
[54:35] just the
[54:37] honeymoon then it's a new heavens and a
[54:39] new Earth not a different one but now a
[54:41] holy fire and someday we're going to
[54:44] stand on this world and I'm here to tell
[54:45] you the people that stand on that world
[54:48] and that's not Disney that's not Fantasy
[54:50] Island that's reality that's soon going
[54:53] to be history
[54:56] hallelujah we're going to stand there
[54:58] and the people who stand there then are
[55:00] going to be so glad they decided now to
[55:03] take the way of God's
[55:06] word no matter how improbable no matter
[55:09] how implausible no matter how impossible
[55:11] it sounds
[55:13] am amen because God calls for leadership
[55:18] according to his word leadership Satan's
[55:20] not afraid of leadership as long as it
[55:22] doesn't have application he's not afraid
[55:25] of you understanding leadership
[55:27] leadership was in heaven it Satan wasn't
[55:30] Satan Satan was rebelling against the
[55:33] operation of leadership amen not the
[55:36] thought of it not the teaching of it the
[55:39] operation of it Heaven had a hierarch
[55:43] hierarchical leadership system and Satan
[55:46] was all the way at the top he was right
[55:49] hand to the angel of the Lord on the
[55:52] throne but he wanted the the main chair
[55:57] he wanted first chair he didn't want
[55:58] second chair and his greed and his his
[56:02] jealousy and his you know it got the
[56:04] better of him and he was an angel all of
[56:07] light until sin was discovered in him he
[56:09] had an eye disease I will Ascend I will
[56:13] be like the most high
[56:16] amen and and so you know that it's it's
[56:19] that it's that rejection of the
[56:21] operation of leadership Satan don't care
[56:23] how much you understand as long as you
[56:25] don't apply it listen up fathers Satan
[56:28] don't care he'll he you he'll let you
[56:31] sit in a message church for
[56:33] decades he'll help you get to church you
[56:36] lose your keys he'll tell you where they
[56:38] are he wants you to think you're all
[56:41] right when you're
[56:43] not that's a that's a tactic he uses to
[56:46] get you to think I'm in a right church I
[56:48] got a good pastor I'm hearing the right
[56:50] word and I enjoy the presence of the
[56:52] people and I have a good time at church
[56:54] and and and maybe you've sit in for
[56:56] decades and have never really had a new
[56:58] birth experience he's all he's all too
[57:01] happy to let you go on thinking that
[57:04] amen I was talking to a young man uh
[57:07] yesterday and we we were conversing back
[57:10] and forth and he got it he got it so
[57:12] clearly the whole idea that yeah you can
[57:14] sit here in this church and you can
[57:16] believe it and you can enjoy it you can
[57:18] love what it does and see the product it
[57:20] produces in the families but have you
[57:22] been born
[57:23] again have have you passed from have you
[57:27] passed from Death to life every man has
[57:29] to ask the question what shall I
[57:32] do you already know what I'm doing what
[57:35] are you doing Hallelujah if you got
[57:38] Godly Parents young people you already
[57:40] know the choice they made what's your
[57:46] choice and so you know I don't want to
[57:48] get too bogged down in that but you know
[57:51] it's it it it affects the priorities of
[57:53] families and families are it's it's a
[57:56] paradox really because it has to be it's
[58:00] it's actually proper leadership in a
[58:02] home which then is the same in a
[58:06] church it's actually
[58:08] paradoxically it has to be built from
[58:11] the ground up but it operates from the
[58:13] top
[58:14] down it's like a paradox it has to be
[58:18] built on the found proper foundation and
[58:21] built up according to the word and once
[58:23] you have that from the Capstone which
[58:26] the head of any family is the father or
[58:29] the husband and then above him is the
[58:32] holy spirit am amen and and so everybody
[58:37] has a head nobody's out from under it
[58:41] see and it's a it's a trickle down
[58:43] operation it's a trickle down it's a top
[58:46] down management amen see and it's got to
[58:49] work that way and if anybody along you
[58:52] know that's where we're problem families
[58:54] have problem problems if if if wives
[58:56] don't get their place if teenagers don't
[58:58] understand their place if everybody's
[59:00] you know trying to be at the top of the
[59:02] Heap God you you listen you want a
[59:05] family and you want a church that God
[59:08] can get behind amen amen anything
[59:11] outside of the line and Order of God's
[59:13] word I don't care what you do it will
[59:15] fail it must fail it's not Eternal God
[59:18] can't support
[59:19] it
[59:21] amen it's my first sermon of the year
[59:25] we need to have this thing established
[59:27] brother brandham says this in what shall
[59:29] I do with Jesus called the
[59:33] Christ he said all these things that he
[59:37] prophesied to be in this
[59:39] day something has to bring that to life
[59:42] but when it's brought to
[59:44] life it'll be so much different than
[59:47] people think it is till it'll only be
[59:50] the elected will see it always just the
[59:53] elected is the only one only thing that
[59:55] will see it because it is elected and
[59:57] ordained to see it therefore it cannot
[1:00:00] no other way now that's historically
[1:00:03] biblically
[1:00:04] inarguable that is inarguable in the
[1:00:07] Bible you go back and you look at that
[1:00:10] and and every time it was only the elite
[1:00:14] uh the elected family of God that that
[1:00:18] understood and followed after God in his
[1:00:21] strange movements amen amen and things
[1:00:25] that he did that defied expectation and
[1:00:28] and the ways he did it and that that are
[1:00:31] that he says your ways are not my ways
[1:00:34] my ways are not yours and my ways are
[1:00:36] above
[1:00:37] yours so this is where faith is going to
[1:00:40] come in you cannot look at the word of
[1:00:43] God from a h always a posible plausible
[1:00:48] or possible way because it is often
[1:00:52] improbable the things that God will do
[1:00:54] do or ask of you to do it is at often
[1:00:58] times implausible that the Lord will say
[1:01:01] if you'll do it this way you'll have
[1:01:03] this good result and that and the way
[1:01:06] he's suggesting is so
[1:01:08] implausible Lord are you kidding if it
[1:01:12] seems that if I do it that way I'm never
[1:01:15] going to accomplish this you know I I
[1:01:18] remember one time years
[1:01:20] ago um you know and and I'm not going to
[1:01:24] go into detail but someone was
[1:01:26] contemplating moving here and attending
[1:01:28] this church and said to me you know we
[1:01:32] we we've built up this wonderful
[1:01:34] business and you know we feel the pull
[1:01:37] to come there we have no church we have
[1:01:39] no real uh word where we live and and uh
[1:01:43] you know the far closest church is many
[1:01:45] hours away and and then we're not even
[1:01:47] sure that church would work for us and
[1:01:49] we appreciate your ministry brother
[1:01:51] Jason but you know we've got this mind
[1:01:53] battle because this business that we've
[1:01:55] built up you know what I said to
[1:01:58] them I said well here's my counsel if
[1:02:03] you believe that you built the business
[1:02:06] then you should probably stay here and
[1:02:08] hang on to
[1:02:10] it but if you believe that God built it
[1:02:14] then what's where's the question you
[1:02:16] think he can't rebuild it here if he
[1:02:19] wants you
[1:02:20] here and that and that did the trick and
[1:02:23] they relocated
[1:02:25] and that was many years ago and and so
[1:02:28] so we find that the word of God is often
[1:02:32] completely
[1:02:33] impractical it is largely
[1:02:36] unpredictable and more often than not it
[1:02:39] is indirect opposition to human
[1:02:42] reasoning itself I mean you know when I
[1:02:45] when now when I think about it and I see
[1:02:49] David looking up at the stars and and I
[1:02:53] mean when I do the same thing I'm like
[1:02:56] David I say to myself who could deny a
[1:03:00] Divine
[1:03:01] Creator when I walk outside and look up
[1:03:04] into the heavens and see the stars and
[1:03:06] the and brother bradam said those stars
[1:03:09] are further apart from each other than
[1:03:11] they are to you amen see and so so like
[1:03:18] David I mean that that's that's where
[1:03:20] where I that's what I Come Away with yet
[1:03:23] science makes its claims against a
[1:03:26] Creator I remember Anthony Hitchens who
[1:03:29] I believe has passed on and and you know
[1:03:32] he he made a statement one time that
[1:03:34] that all
[1:03:36] arguments uh fall before all arguments
[1:03:39] of a Divine Creator fall down before
[1:03:42] scientific reasoning and you know I
[1:03:46] would say this that he's not completely
[1:03:48] wrong in that premise it's just that he
[1:03:51] he looks he was looking at it out of
[1:03:53] balance I mean God God does do things
[1:03:56] that seem
[1:03:57] impossible God does do things on purpose
[1:04:00] that are on purpose and he has
[1:04:04] intent now not malice he has in his
[1:04:08] intent is life his intent is to get you
[1:04:11] to have faith because without faith it's
[1:04:14] already impossible to please God a lot
[1:04:17] of times if your faith isn't you're not
[1:04:20] pleasing him because your faith isn't
[1:04:22] high enough he will put you in
[1:04:24] impossible situations again and again
[1:04:27] and again until you trust him and then
[1:04:29] let him get you out of it and then
[1:04:31] you'll
[1:04:32] see Hallelujah listen friends the
[1:04:35] fastest way to get a trial is the
[1:04:37] fastest way to get a test is fail
[1:04:42] one I've been saying that for years the
[1:04:46] fastest way to get a test from God is to
[1:04:49] fail one and I promise you you'll take
[1:04:52] it again and again and again until you
[1:04:56] pass
[1:04:58] it so you know I but but I'm like David
[1:05:02] I look at the heavens and and a truth
[1:05:06] Wells up within me I remember you know
[1:05:08] when we first built our house there in
[1:05:10] Christine we were the only ones in that
[1:05:12] neighborhood was didn't have maybe a
[1:05:13] third of the houses and we were one of
[1:05:15] the F most early families in our
[1:05:18] culdesac we were the only house there
[1:05:20] were no other houses in our
[1:05:22] culdesac me and my boys would go out
[1:05:25] it's one of my fondest memory me and my
[1:05:27] boys they were just you know I forget
[1:05:29] probably at at that time 1999 however
[1:05:32] old they would have been and we would go
[1:05:35] out into the culdesac and and we would
[1:05:37] lay in four ways with our heads all
[1:05:40] together and we would lay there and just
[1:05:42] look up at the stars and I'd talk to
[1:05:44] them about God and about creation and
[1:05:46] they would just look there and their
[1:05:48] wondering eyes just marveling at these
[1:05:51] things and that that's something that P
[1:05:54] dividends to me now see and so so we we
[1:05:59] when I look up at the heavens there's
[1:06:01] something that it within my soul that I
[1:06:05] can't put it under a
[1:06:07] microscope neither can I put love under
[1:06:09] a microscope but I know it's
[1:06:12] real I I'm not I'm not I I might can't
[1:06:16] explain that feeling I have like David I
[1:06:19] might couldn't explain that to Anthony
[1:06:21] Hitchens frankly I wouldn't even care to
[1:06:24] because sometimes the feeling we have in
[1:06:26] our heart defies explanation you can't
[1:06:29] even explain it to yourself you just
[1:06:31] believe it there's just something that
[1:06:33] hangs on inside there that won't let you
[1:06:36] doubt it I'm I'm here to tell you I'm
[1:06:38] sure that if Mr Hitchens did not repent
[1:06:41] before his deathbed he is you talking
[1:06:43] about an Agony of
[1:06:47] regret he's a Believer
[1:06:51] today millions of people are going to be
[1:06:54] become Believers too
[1:07:02] late when we think about historical
[1:07:05] occurrences that
[1:07:07] are based and driven by prophecy I'm I'm
[1:07:11] a student of history and I've for years
[1:07:13] have have correlated prophecy and
[1:07:16] history some of my favorite is to take
[1:07:18] the visions of Daniel and the four
[1:07:21] Gentile kingdoms beginning with the of
[1:07:24] gold and on down through uh
[1:07:26] Nebuchadnezzar and the and the Persian
[1:07:29] Empire and the Grecian Empire and the
[1:07:31] Roman
[1:07:32] Empire and you know and and then when
[1:07:36] you look and and you can see all other
[1:07:38] ancient Eastern cultures you know the
[1:07:41] Assyrians were a great nation that was
[1:07:43] where Jonah was sent to Nineveh was
[1:07:46] their was their Royal Capital uh was our
[1:07:49] federal capital there in in Nineveh and
[1:07:52] but you know when we find that finally
[1:07:55] when sarib comes and my goodness you
[1:07:59] know sarib with two and a half million
[1:08:02] man army he had already defeated Egypt
[1:08:07] he had already they were just sweeping
[1:08:10] through the ancient Eastern World snack
[1:08:13] was Unstoppable he was just he was just
[1:08:16] he he went into Judea and he just one
[1:08:20] city after another took them with ease
[1:08:23] with EAS
[1:08:25] and I I believe he was the king that
[1:08:27] very cruy I may have said this here
[1:08:29] previously that if you if you didn't
[1:08:32] fight and you surrendered he would let
[1:08:33] he would let everybody live but all the
[1:08:35] men had to have the right eye plucked
[1:08:38] out and that was his
[1:08:40] Mercy that was that was his benevolence
[1:08:43] I'll let you live but I'm going to pluck
[1:08:45] your right eye out so that everybody
[1:08:47] will know that you are in tribute to
[1:08:50] sakb and you know when he comes down to
[1:08:54] Jerusalem and Hezekiah is
[1:08:57] there I mean the odds for Hezekiah were
[1:09:01] not only
[1:09:03] insurmountable they were completely
[1:09:05] impossible s sakb actually you know
[1:09:09] offered Hezekiah a reward if he could
[1:09:12] put 2,000 men in on
[1:09:16] Horseback here he he's got an Army of 2
[1:09:18] and a half million and he says you you
[1:09:21] can't even field 2,000 men how are you
[1:09:25] going to resist me you trusted in Egypt
[1:09:27] I sacked Egypt no one can stop me you
[1:09:31] think you're Gods can stop me no one can
[1:09:34] stop me and I mean two and a half
[1:09:36] million man
[1:09:38] army mowed down everybody in his path
[1:09:41] Egypt fell before him you know this was
[1:09:44] a pretty good threat and it worked out
[1:09:47] really good for sakb until the angel of
[1:09:49] the Lord went into his camp in the
[1:09:52] middle of the night and started busting
[1:09:53] heads am amen by the time the angel of
[1:09:57] the Lord got done half his army was dead
[1:09:59] and the rest were in disarray and they
[1:10:01] all fled in Retreat the next day you
[1:10:03] know why because a prophet had said to
[1:10:06] Isaiah don't you fear God was going to
[1:10:08] fight this battle you're talking about
[1:10:12] impossible you're talking about
[1:10:13] implausible you're talking about
[1:10:16] something that something that that is so
[1:10:18] improbable as to be
[1:10:22] impossible but you know why that it
[1:10:25] worked because
[1:10:27] prophetically all history is controlled
[1:10:29] by prophecy and always has
[1:10:32] been it comes forth with the great goat
[1:10:35] with the notable horn that smashed the
[1:10:38] ram the ram had of Persia had smashed
[1:10:43] the
[1:10:44] Babylonians and then there was nothing
[1:10:46] before the Persian Empire I mean you
[1:10:49] know million man standing army and and
[1:10:53] by some ancient historians you know and
[1:10:56] U modern day historians you know there's
[1:10:58] a lot of disparity between what they
[1:11:01] believe but but here here's what they
[1:11:04] all agree on when
[1:11:06] Alexander entered into when the goat ran
[1:11:10] toward the the ram in the Bible it says
[1:11:14] that the ram pushed in every direction
[1:11:16] and nothing could withstand him until a
[1:11:18] goat rose up with a notable horn that
[1:11:20] flew across the ground and smashed into
[1:11:23] the RAM and the ram had no strength
[1:11:25] against him that was Daniel's
[1:11:27] prophecy long you know centuries before
[1:11:30] it came to pass and when Alexander
[1:11:32] here's here's what they all agree with
[1:11:34] some say you know the the the Persian
[1:11:37] Empire could field a million men
[1:11:38] Alexander there's no historian that even
[1:11:41] suggests he ever at any time had even
[1:11:44] had even 50,000 men some as low as in
[1:11:47] the
[1:11:48] 20,000 here's the bottom line that they
[1:11:50] all agree with he had he was basically
[1:11:52] outnumbered five to one amen and he
[1:11:55] wasn't fighting farmers amen he was
[1:11:59] fighting a trained
[1:12:01] Army Warrior Warrior people uh that that
[1:12:06] that that was I mean it it made it so
[1:12:08] impossible that that Alexander couldn't
[1:12:12] even
[1:12:13] win just like sakar couldn't lose until
[1:12:17] he did Alexander couldn't win I mean
[1:12:22] Darius of the
[1:12:24] Persians he had a he had a
[1:12:27] 10,000 man King's Guard they were his
[1:12:32] shock troops his Elite Force they were
[1:12:35] his special forces you know what they
[1:12:37] called them the
[1:12:39] Immortals he had a 10,000 man shock
[1:12:44] troop special forces called The
[1:12:47] Immortals and they they operated in a
[1:12:50] way that if you killed one and he fell a
[1:12:53] next man immediately took his place and
[1:12:55] if you killed him another one
[1:12:56] immediately took his place and it was
[1:12:58] psychologically overwhelming like we
[1:13:00] can't kill these guys every time we
[1:13:02] strike them down they come right back
[1:13:04] because you got 10,000 right behind it
[1:13:06] coming forward and this is his elite
[1:13:09] soldiers and Alexander goes in with a
[1:13:12] with a fifth of that
[1:13:14] Army and he's fighting trained Warriors
[1:13:17] who had smashed the
[1:13:20] Babylonians you're talking about
[1:13:22] improbable you talking about implausible
[1:13:25] n and to Impossible and Alexander
[1:13:28] doesn't just defeat the Persians he just
[1:13:32] he crushes them in three or four major
[1:13:37] conflicts crushes them goes into India
[1:13:40] and fights against those and and and
[1:13:43] defeats them I mean it was it was so
[1:13:45] improbable so implausible so impossible
[1:13:48] but With God all things are possible
[1:13:52] because God had already got Daniel and
[1:13:56] Daniel wrote it in a book and said that
[1:13:58] there's a there's a Ram with two horns
[1:14:00] but there Rises up a goat with one
[1:14:02] notable horn and the ram is Invincible
[1:14:05] until the goat crushes
[1:14:10] himen Hitler had those same that same
[1:14:13] idea he had shock troop a shock troop
[1:14:15] core called the
[1:14:17] SS I mean
[1:14:20] how how shocking is it to you
[1:14:24] for a prophet to
[1:14:25] say the
[1:14:27] Holocaust was the tender
[1:14:30] hand of
[1:14:32] Jehovah wait
[1:14:35] what the
[1:14:37] Holocaust one of the
[1:14:40] most cataclysmic events to for Any
[1:14:43] Nation to suffer for any race of
[1:14:47] people and it the horrors were
[1:14:52] unspeakable
[1:14:54] and the prophet says it was the tender
[1:14:56] hand of
[1:14:59] Jehovah
[1:15:00] friends whatever it
[1:15:03] takes for God to get you
[1:15:07] home is the tender hand of
[1:15:12] Jehovah don't never lose sight of that
[1:15:15] no matter what it requires him to do and
[1:15:19] you ought to have the heart today to say
[1:15:21] Lord by whatever means
[1:15:24] necessary I came from God I want to go
[1:15:28] back to God there's this world is not my
[1:15:31] home I'm just passing through even my
[1:15:35] treasures are laid up somewhere beyond
[1:15:38] the blue
[1:15:39] hallelu amen God's family I could I
[1:15:43] could you know I I could almost you know
[1:15:46] wax dramatic like Paul and say what more
[1:15:50] could I say what could I say more for
[1:15:53] for time would fail me to tell of Moses
[1:15:56] at the Red
[1:15:57] Sea to to tell of of Jeremiah when when
[1:16:02] Jeremiah is pleading in prayer against
[1:16:05] the evil that's going on in Israel and
[1:16:07] God you got to come do something about
[1:16:09] this this is terrible this is contrary
[1:16:11] to the word you you can't just let this
[1:16:13] go and the Lord come to him and said
[1:16:16] Jeremiah if I you if I told you what I
[1:16:20] was going to do you wouldn't even
[1:16:21] believe me
[1:16:24] I'm actually going to bring the King of
[1:16:25] the North in and he's going to sack the
[1:16:28] country and kill them wholesale and take
[1:16:31] them in captivity and then I'm going to
[1:16:34] restore them back and then Jeremiah no I
[1:16:38] was never mind forget my prayer I don't
[1:16:40] don't please don't let that
[1:16:42] happen sometimes if if the Lord lets us
[1:16:44] know I'm glad he
[1:16:46] doesn't I'm just and that's why I just
[1:16:48] say Lord whatever it takes I don't need
[1:16:50] to know I don't want to think about it
[1:16:52] I'm just I'm I'm humbling myself right
[1:16:54] now to whatever it takes to make me look
[1:16:57] like this oh can that be your desire
[1:17:02] today you find young men you find young
[1:17:05] sisters married single elderly can that
[1:17:08] be your desire
[1:17:16] today you know they're talking about
[1:17:19] implausible
[1:17:22] things
[1:17:24] there's no way Eve would choose to
[1:17:26] believe the Serpent's word over Elohim
[1:17:29] would she I mean who would do
[1:17:33] that you you try to imagine the shock
[1:17:36] and all that
[1:17:39] Adam came into contact with when he you
[1:17:42] did you did
[1:17:44] what
[1:17:46] but but God said oh but you know that's
[1:17:50] just because you know he knows that
[1:17:53] you'll be like him I found out I got I
[1:17:55] went to a church service and I found out
[1:17:57] that that that you you don't have to
[1:17:59] keep all of the word of God but actually
[1:18:02] it's just God keeping you down and uh
[1:18:05] really you need to have some Modern
[1:18:06] thinking
[1:18:08] Adam and he knew she was doomed and only
[1:18:11] his love for her saved
[1:18:15] her there's no way she would do that
[1:18:18] until she
[1:18:19] did you know the situation of a man born
[1:18:22] in sin you want to talk about something
[1:18:23] impossible try to get to heaven born in
[1:18:26] sin you have no way you talk about
[1:18:29] something so impossible for him to save
[1:18:31] himself from listen before you're born
[1:18:34] again even your human mind is enmity
[1:18:37] against the word of God even if you know
[1:18:40] it's right you just can't bring yourself
[1:18:43] to do
[1:18:44] it you have no chance except God rich in
[1:18:48] Mercy hallelujah hallelujah God rich in
[1:18:52] Mercy even if I know I'm going to be
[1:18:54] destroyed and even if I know it's right
[1:18:56] and even if I don't want to die and even
[1:18:58] if I want to go to heaven I still can't
[1:19:00] bring myself to it it's God rich in
[1:19:03] Mercy to come down and change my heart
[1:19:06] and change my
[1:19:08] mind
[1:19:10] right you you talk about something
[1:19:13] implausible I mean pilate just knew the
[1:19:16] Jews would choose
[1:19:17] Barabas there's no way they want you
[1:19:20] there's no
[1:19:21] way
[1:19:23] pilate you know he's you can hear him
[1:19:25] his
[1:19:26] exasperation let him be crucified why
[1:19:29] what has he done what sin has he
[1:19:30] committed this man has done nothing
[1:19:32] worthy of death I'm a judge I'm a
[1:19:34] governor I judge the man he's done
[1:19:36] nothing worthy of death you know give
[1:19:37] him a weapon and let him go it's not the
[1:19:40] matter of civilized Nations you know I'm
[1:19:42] Rome we're a Civilized Nation we don't
[1:19:45] kill people for no
[1:19:47] reason you know and and but but the Jews
[1:19:50] were just insane
[1:19:54] with anger and
[1:19:56] resentment and so pilate just goes for
[1:19:59] broke he just says okay I know how I'll
[1:20:00] get out of this I'll make this thing so
[1:20:03] implausible so impossible so so there's
[1:20:06] no way they'll choose barabus who would
[1:20:08] you rather that I release unto you Jesus
[1:20:11] the king you know Jesus of Nazareth or
[1:20:14] barabus barabus or Jesus give us
[1:20:21] barabus the murderer
[1:20:26] yes the man who has
[1:20:28] murdered innocent
[1:20:31] people yes some of them were your
[1:20:33] neighbors we know some of them were your
[1:20:35] family we
[1:20:37] know what is this man done nobody
[1:20:40] defended him that day that's why brother
[1:20:41] brandham said I'm going to give him a
[1:20:43] new trial said he didn't get a fair
[1:20:45] trial on that day I'm going to give him
[1:20:47] a new trial oh where was the people that
[1:20:50] could have stood up and spoke for him
[1:20:52] and he wouldn't speak cuz he opened not
[1:20:54] his mouth they could have said are you
[1:20:56] kidding you're we're going to take a
[1:20:59] murderer who has killed innocent people
[1:21:03] who has no compassion for human life and
[1:21:05] is just a thief and a murderer and will
[1:21:07] kill to get what he wants and this man
[1:21:10] has done nothing but but help the
[1:21:12] thousands and feed the thousands
[1:21:15] multiple times he's healed Our Sick he's
[1:21:18] raised our dead he's given us the ways
[1:21:20] of light and taught us the roach to life
[1:21:24] we're going to choose a
[1:21:28] murderer
[1:21:30] impossible until they did
[1:21:33] it they didn't even
[1:21:36] hesitate they absolutely were in such a
[1:21:39] frenzy they they had such a hatred you
[1:21:42] know I mean I mean wow you know can I
[1:21:47] mean can anyone
[1:21:49] rightly
[1:21:50] disbelieve today
[1:21:53] that we are fighting a a very ancient
[1:21:58] evil in this
[1:22:01] world brother Brenham comes
[1:22:04] to a message and he calls it the
[1:22:08] indictment a lot of
[1:22:11] audacity you you know they thought you
[1:22:13] William brandham you itinerate you
[1:22:16] uneducated idiot who are you to we're
[1:22:19] doctors of
[1:22:21] divinity and and you're going to tell
[1:22:24] us and and a prophet says I'm going to
[1:22:27] do more than just tell you I'm going to
[1:22:29] accuse you of the second crucifixion of
[1:22:31] the word and not only am I going to do
[1:22:34] that but I'm going to do it in the
[1:22:35] presence of the
[1:22:37] judge and he said I indict this
[1:22:40] generation for the second
[1:22:43] crucifixion of the word I mean come on
[1:22:46] friends nobody in the right mind say how
[1:22:49] do you know it's evil because nobody in
[1:22:52] the right mind would choose modern
[1:22:54] organized Christianity over the truth of
[1:22:57] this hour a murderer of the word why
[1:23:02] don't you just be back there and choose
[1:23:03] baratus bar barabus beg your
[1:23:08] pardon why don't you just go back there
[1:23:10] and choose
[1:23:11] Barabas because that's what they're
[1:23:13] doing today a prophet said that's
[1:23:16] brother bram's own words a murderer of
[1:23:18] the word modern Christianity so-called a
[1:23:24] a murderer of the word a complete
[1:23:27] Antichrist agenda that is against the
[1:23:31] new word uh that that that is that is
[1:23:33] against the word of God I'm here to tell
[1:23:35] you something friends what what are you
[1:23:37] looking at with this new
[1:23:40] year what's on your heart what's on your
[1:23:43] mind today amen what are you thinking
[1:23:46] are are you looking for spiritual growth
[1:23:49] in your home are you looking for
[1:23:51] spiritual growth in the people who live
[1:23:53] there oh my listen I I want you to know
[1:23:56] you've got two choices you either raise
[1:23:59] them in the admonition of God in the way
[1:24:01] they ought to go or Satan will do it for
[1:24:04] you leoa will do it for you we see
[1:24:07] plenty of encouragement from the from
[1:24:10] the spirit of of the Antichrist in Leo
[1:24:14] DEA you know and and and and you you see
[1:24:18] that don't
[1:24:19] you surely parents see that I mean h how
[1:24:23] could we how could we not see that the
[1:24:26] spirit that is leading this age is an
[1:24:29] antichrist Spirit listen Satan has
[1:24:32] designed it that
[1:24:35] way he's designed it that way uh to to
[1:24:39] influence you to be all that you can get
[1:24:44] all you can forget the leadership of the
[1:24:47] word of God man forget that do you uh go
[1:24:50] for it be be everything oh I'm here to
[1:24:53] tell you that's the that's the leot toan
[1:24:56] Antichrist Spirit but there is a another
[1:24:59] spirit that when I look into the heavens
[1:25:01] I say I want the one that created the
[1:25:03] Stars I want the one that wrote this
[1:25:05] word I want the one that opened the Red
[1:25:07] Sea I want the one that destroyed enemy
[1:25:10] armies when I had no
[1:25:13] chance I want the one that gave me a
[1:25:16] mind that can agree with the word of
[1:25:21] God
[1:25:23] no regard for what
[1:25:26] then I I remember that old Melia Jackson
[1:25:31] song I used to listen to that as a
[1:25:32] teenager I'd play it over and over again
[1:25:35] even you know it just stirred my heart
[1:25:38] you
[1:25:41] know the and even it's so unique of a
[1:25:44] song lyrics are even hard to
[1:25:47] find uh so I actually had to listen to
[1:25:49] the song
[1:25:50] again and and just jot down a few of the
[1:25:54] real
[1:25:56] burners brother brandham talks about
[1:25:59] this very song in
[1:26:02] 1955 in mzc Prince and
[1:26:07] King and she
[1:26:09] says when the
[1:26:11] choir has sung its last
[1:26:16] Anthem I should have played her singing
[1:26:18] it to you today and the
[1:26:21] preacher has prayed his last
[1:26:25] prayer and the people have heard their
[1:26:30] last
[1:26:31] sermon and the world that's rejected its
[1:26:36] savior will be asked for a
[1:26:40] reason she says what
[1:26:45] then when the choir sung its last
[1:26:48] anthem when you've ever heard the last
[1:26:50] sermon you'll ever hear on this life
[1:26:52] what
[1:26:53] then when the world stands there on that
[1:26:56] day at the Judgment
[1:26:58] bar I I remember brother Ernie told me
[1:27:01] just sometime before he passed away he
[1:27:04] had a dream and he said brother Jason he
[1:27:07] come telling me about it he said brother
[1:27:09] Jason he said in my dream I saw millions
[1:27:11] of people stand Before the Throne of
[1:27:14] God and he said I and and God asked them
[1:27:18] when they stood before his throne and he
[1:27:20] said here he said every person that
[1:27:22] stepped up God asked them the same
[1:27:24] question they bowed their head and W
[1:27:26] went away next person stood up he said
[1:27:27] there were Millions just coming up
[1:27:29] before the throne and he said every time
[1:27:32] somebody stepped up before the
[1:27:35] throne he said God would say to them
[1:27:39] what did you do with the last years of
[1:27:42] your life when you knew I was
[1:27:47] coming
[1:27:49] amen when a world that's rejected its
[1:27:53] savior Jackson
[1:27:55] saying they will be asked for a
[1:27:58] reason what
[1:28:01] then you know I I'm just going to skip
[1:28:04] some parts
[1:28:06] here I finished
[1:28:10] off on the last service that I preached
[1:28:13] to you in 2023 with an encouragement to
[1:28:15] let that year go with all of its
[1:28:17] failures and let's let's have Revival
[1:28:21] and let's start again with a new purpose
[1:28:23] am to move forward we talked about you
[1:28:26] know the sad day that it was for the
[1:28:28] world and yet in a strange twist it's a
[1:28:31] happy and a triumphant day for the bride
[1:28:34] I mean that's both that's not only a
[1:28:36] paradox that's a mind Bender amen I mean
[1:28:39] how is something so tragic for the world
[1:28:43] just what lies just ahead for
[1:28:46] them H H how do you get your mind around
[1:28:49] that as a reality and that's a reality
[1:28:53] versus we who are not on the other side
[1:28:56] yet we're still right here in the midst
[1:28:58] of all of this and for us it's a happy
[1:29:02] day say you love the world not at
[1:29:05] all see you say well then how how can
[1:29:08] you be thrilled because Jesus said to me
[1:29:10] when I see all of these things look
[1:29:12] up your Redemption draweth nigh I can't
[1:29:16] wait to be on the other
[1:29:19] side Hallelujah friends it is so it is
[1:29:23] such a wonderful thought to me I close
[1:29:25] my eyes and I just think about my life
[1:29:27] in glory my life not somewhere beyond
[1:29:30] the blue right back here right on this
[1:29:32] Earth with a millennial world no stress
[1:29:35] no anxiety nothing pressing you no no

[1:29:54] up every day with no anxiety at all
[1:29:57] nothing to worry about amen
[1:30:02] amen it I'm sorry and and it is sad it's
[1:30:06] brother brandom comes to his last sermon
[1:30:08] in 1964 I believe it is and he starts
[1:30:10] talking about that he said it's a very
[1:30:12] sad day for the world he said because it
[1:30:14] must now go off into complete Insanity
[1:30:16] and that was 64 and it certainly has
[1:30:18] happened but he says what a glorious
[1:30:20] time it is for the believer
[1:30:22] so you know that that was my message to
[1:30:25] you last time the year is ending but I'm
[1:30:29] not ending the year is ending one of
[1:30:32] these years is going to be it's going to

[1:31:03] blood perpetually speaks for you there's
[1:31:07] a Perpetual blood sacrifice laying there
[1:31:10] so that no matter what mistakes God's
[1:31:12] family would make God can't see it he he
[1:31:16] doesn't even aware of it because because
[1:31:18] the blood of Christ is speaking
[1:31:20] beautiful things

[1:31:23] constantly oh friends it's a Perpetual

[1:31:54] ends I have eternal life wherever I have
[1:31:57] failed I can
[1:31:59] rebuild that's what it is and that's
[1:32:02] what the blood is and that's what the
[1:32:04] blood does see that's what it is that's
[1:32:09] what it does
[1:32:13] Amen I'm going to close with
[1:32:18] this I've explained to you what the
[1:32:21] blood is
[1:32:23] and what it

[1:32:32] of jail free
[1:32:34] card the blood of Christ is not a get
[1:32:38] out of responsibility
[1:32:41] card as brother brandham said an
[1:32:43] overcomer doesn't get pushed through a
[1:32:45] piper you know and another way of saying
[1:32:48] that is poured into a mold and the mold
[1:32:50] closes and you dry and then he pulls you
[1:32:51] and Pops you out what a glorious
[1:32:53] Overcomer brother Bram says you know
[1:32:55] pushing you through a pipe meaning like
[1:32:56] pushing you through a form and bending
[1:32:58] you you know it's not about that and and
[1:33:03] the O the Overcomer doesn't get pushed
[1:33:05] through a pipe or formed out of a mold

[1:33:10] to face it and you have to face it yes

[1:33:22] in my life and in your life it's really
[1:33:24] just this simple who will accept the
[1:33:27] challenge who will say Lord I'll take

[1:33:47] just in this life you're challenged to
[1:33:50] re to to achieve victory Victory not
[1:33:52] just in the life to come but in the life
[1:33:54] you have
[1:33:56] now right now teenagers you are
[1:33:59] challenged to let the mind which was in
[1:34:02] Christ be in you it ain't all up to Mom
[1:34:04] and Dad to do it or brother Jason to do
[1:34:07] it it it's you you have to say what
[1:34:09] shall I do with Jesus called the Christ
[1:34:15] amen Isaac Watts published a a lot of
[1:34:19] songs some of them very familiar to
[1:34:23] us
[1:34:26] 1721 he wrote a certain song he lived in
[1:34:28] that
[1:34:30] era he wrote AAS and Did My Savior Bleed
[1:34:35] he wrote When I Survey the Wondrous
[1:34:37] Cross he wrote we're marching to Zion he
[1:34:39] wrote Joy to the World Isaac Watts great
[1:34:43] Gallant Christian man 1721 he wrote a
[1:34:46] song that brother brandham quoted
[1:34:48] often quoted a a a a a few
[1:34:53] bars and he wrote a song called am I a
[1:34:57] soldier of the Cross now it's a self-
[1:35:01] anwering question he he's he's actually
[1:35:03] going to pose it as a question am I a
[1:35:06] soldier of the Cross but then he's going
[1:35:08] to prove it to himself that he
[1:35:11] is and that if he is then this must be
[1:35:15] true this reality if if this is true
[1:35:18] then this must be true amen
[1:35:22] and he
[1:35:23] writes am I a soldier of the cross a
[1:35:27] follower of the
[1:35:29] lamb and Shall I Fear to own his cause
[1:35:34] or blush to speak his
[1:35:36] name that's a good question don't you
[1:35:38] think that's a fair question am I a
[1:35:40] soldier of the Cross ask yourself that
[1:35:42] today am I a soldier of the Cross watch
[1:35:45] says am I a soldier of the cross a
[1:35:47] follower of the Lamb Shall I Fear to own
[1:35:50] his cause are blushed to speak his name
[1:35:53] and here's the one brother brandham
[1:35:54] often uh talked about must I be carried
[1:35:58] to the skies on flowery beds of ease
[1:36:02] While others fought to win the prize and
[1:36:04] sailed through bloody
[1:36:06] Seas a gripping question what do you
[1:36:09] want a free ride what you don't want to
[1:36:11] do your
[1:36:13] part is that your
[1:36:15] caliber you might be a fine young man a
[1:36:18] fine young sister but are you are you
[1:36:20] going to let everybody else do do you're
[1:36:21] fighting do your praying do your
[1:36:26] living must I be carried to the skies on
[1:36:30] flowery beds of ease While others fought
[1:36:32] to win the prize and sailed through
[1:36:34] bloody Seas verse three are there no
[1:36:37] foes for me to
[1:36:39] face must I not stem the flood is this
[1:36:44] vile World a friend of Grace to help me
[1:36:46] on to God that's a wonderful conclusion
[1:36:49] I just say yes sir her this world and
[1:36:52] all of its evil is in one way a friend
[1:36:55] of Grace because it's spurring me I want
[1:36:57] out of here I want another world I want
[1:37:00] another
[1:37:02] existence he says sure that's how he
[1:37:04] opens the fourth verse sure and here's
[1:37:07] where brother brandham would pick it up
[1:37:09] sure I must fight if I would Reign
[1:37:13] increase my courage Lord that ought to
[1:37:16] be our desire today to say I must I must
[1:37:18] fight if I Would Rain increase my
[1:37:20] courage
