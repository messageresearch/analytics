[44:26] shall not fall on the ground without
[44:29] your father
[44:31] but the very hairs of your head are all
[44:34] numbered
[44:35] and fear ye not therefore ye
[44:38] are more of more value than many
[44:42] sparrows
[44:44] and may the lord bless the reading of
[44:45] the word this evening as you have your
[44:48] seats
[44:50] amen
[44:55] i want to get a good look at you god
[44:58] bless you brother you kind of come down

[45:09] just
[45:15] wanna see sister debbie
[45:20] amen all of you i would
[45:24] just um
[45:28] get to missing you all pretty bad but i
[45:31] don't want to talk about
[45:32] it or else i won't be able to see
[45:35] my book and so sister gene i
[45:38] i'll leave her for a while all right
[45:44] amen but we just trust the lord too
[45:49] that whatever we do it won't be for very
[45:52] long
[45:53] and i i trust it will that the
[45:57] ransomed host of god be
[46:00] gathered amen with our people
[46:06] and
[46:09] trying to hold it together it's not
[46:12] doing very well
[46:14] but we just just truly truly
[46:18] appreciate you all and
[46:22] your your your prayers
[46:25] for us and the lord has been very
[46:29] very good to us uh there in flagstaff
[46:32] and uh
[46:33] has given us souls for our labor
[46:36] and the first year we've baptized i
[46:39] think four or five
[46:41] uh 4 4 we baptized and
[46:44] we've
[46:47] had a couple of graduations where we
[46:49] send a few off to
[46:51] be with the lord and and that was very
[46:53] painful for us
[46:54] and but as a first year of a pastor i've
[46:57] i've baptized them i've married them i'm
[47:00] buried them so
[47:01] you know we're just doing everything
[47:03] we're supposed to do dedicated them and
[47:06] we've had a few born and a few that went
[47:08] on to be with the lord
[47:10] and so we we've uh
[47:14] just trusting the lord to give us many
[47:17] souls for our labor good to see brother
[47:21] jason and he come out and
[47:23] ministered for us and and people
[47:27] really appreciated him to come out and
[47:29] and
[47:31] hold some services for us and so
[47:35] my wife says don't say that but y'all
[47:38] come see us you know
[47:40] and and she says every time you say that
[47:44] they end up showing up right when we get
[47:45] there
[47:47] so maybe we'll be there for a little
[47:48] while and get the yard mowed before you
[47:51] get there but
[47:52] uh if not why you just have to help us
[47:55] mow grass by the way
[47:57] and uh but we appreciate you and love
[47:59] you dearly
[48:00] and want you to know that we you're
[48:03] you're not
[48:04] you're not forgotten we love you with
[48:07] all of our hearts and think about you
[48:09] pray for you on a regular basis amen
[48:12] it's mutual woes friend we have when
[48:15] things happen the body
[48:16] here when they go through their
[48:18] struggles and
[48:20] things you know brother
[48:23] you know different ones
[48:26] empty seats that won't be filled on this
[48:29] time again
[48:32] and uh that's always hard you know you
[48:36] you know you leave and and someone goes
[48:38] on to be with the lord and you come back
[48:40] and then now they're
[48:41] they're not with us anymore and that's
[48:44] that's hard to
[48:45] to you know to uh
[48:48] to realize sometimes but you know
[48:51] uh you know my seat will be empty if the
[48:55] lord tarries someday you know your seat
[48:57] will be empty but
[48:58] on this side and there'll be others
[49:00] that'll trust that'll
[49:02] carry the gospel out to the next
[49:04] generation but
[49:06] i have to believe with all of my heart
[49:09] that
[49:11] there won't we're not
[49:14] we're not those that are saying you know
[49:17] what the lord he delays us coming and so
[49:19] forth
[49:19] i say even so lord jesus yes come
[49:22] quickly
[49:23] amen i i i really believe with all of my
[49:27] heart that we are
[49:29] those in whom the ends of the earth
[49:32] have come upon and and it doesn't take
[49:34] much
[49:35] research to see that amen you can just
[49:38] look around
[49:39] and sharing with brother jason uh just
[49:41] the other day that
[49:43] you know i've always been kind of a
[49:46] politically savvy you know always
[49:49] try to stay abreast of what's going on
[49:51] in in major politics you know none of
[49:53] this
[49:54] nonsense but the major movements and
[49:57] what's
[49:58] you know what what to expect you know
[50:00] and things like that
[50:01] watching you know real estate in the
[50:04] stock market and all these kind of
[50:05] things you know just keep abreast of
[50:06] those things well
[50:08] you know the other day it just got it
[50:10] became nauseating to me i just said you
[50:12] know
[50:14] not interested in that anymore uh
[50:17] doesn't matter if the stock market
[50:19] crashes it doesn't matter if real estate
[50:21] goes
[50:22] you know to zero or negative interest
[50:25] you know it is absolutely have no
[50:27] meaning to me
[50:28] whatsoever uh i have uh i've signed out
[50:33] amen i've uh i'm looking for
[50:36] uh as brother david gadman said i'm not
[50:38] looking for a hole in the ground
[50:40] i'm looking for for a hole in the sky
[50:42] amen
[50:43] not looking for an airplane ride i'm
[50:45] looking for a plein air ride amen
[50:48] amen just uh just gonna take a little
[50:52] trip on the old
[50:53] gospel ship and wave this world goodbye
[50:57] amen
[51:00] this evening i would like to just maybe
[51:03] just encourage you a little
[51:04] in the lord as we
[51:08] read our text here this was the um
[51:12] inspiration for a little story i i'm
[51:15] sure
[51:15] brother jason has told it here but i i
[51:17] want to
[51:18] just reiterate it because i want to take
[51:20] a whole thought on it
[51:22] but brother stanley had made a statement
[51:24] and i we we
[51:25] haven't definitively
[51:28] decided whether it was actually him that
[51:30] did this or if it was someone that he
[51:32] knew that did this but he told the story
[51:34] originally
[51:36] but that and we'll just i believe it was
[51:38] him that they were driving along and uh
[51:40] the the uh a sparrow hit the car
[51:44] and the brother backed up and went back
[51:47] to where the the sparrow was they asked
[51:48] him well
[51:49] what are you doing he said i'm going
[51:50] back to where that sparrow is and they
[51:52] got out and stood by the by the little
[51:55] bird and
[51:56] and they said well what are you doing
[51:57] that for he said because i know
[52:00] that the bible says that not one of
[52:03] these little fellows can fall to the
[52:05] ground but what out the father knows it
[52:07] he said i want to be standing somewhere
[52:09] god is looking
[52:12] and that's so so became so relevant
[52:16] to me because the bible is
[52:19] uh tells us that this that this little
[52:22] fellow here
[52:23] that this little bird that is that
[52:26] though it could be one place that says
[52:30] that
[52:30] you could well here it says that uh two
[52:32] could be
[52:33] uh sold for a farthing is about a penny
[52:37] and uh i think another one where it says
[52:40] that uh
[52:40] uh five can be sold for two pennies
[52:44] and so you get a bargain if you buy more
[52:48] you know but but even then it's it's at
[52:51] such a
[52:52] insignificant amount of money
[52:55] to buy these little insignificant birds
[52:59] now the the sparrow was uh also was
[53:02] classified based i could
[53:04] see in the old testament were class they
[53:07] didn't have no gaul
[53:08] and so they were like a dove they they
[53:10] were a clean bird they were
[53:12] actually edible and uh that you they
[53:15] could actually be
[53:16] uh the offering for leprosy uh
[53:20] for the poor or or well a leper
[53:23] uh would not have anything to offer
[53:26] anyways and so just for a few
[53:28] cents uh uh in our thinking
[53:31] uh that you could get these birds and uh
[53:34] two birds and one they would
[53:36] uh take its head and ring its head and
[53:39] sprinkle the blood of the one on the
[53:40] other and you know the story about the
[53:42] speckled bird and
[53:43] and this actually could be applied to
[53:45] the sparrow in some translations it
[53:47] actually uses
[53:49] the sparrow as the bird and and some it
[53:52] just
[53:52] leaves it generically and then another
[53:54] translation it says turtle doves so
[53:57] it could be uh either or
[54:00] and so uh this this little
[54:03] bird here that the bible tells us that
[54:07] you are worth more than many
[54:10] of these birds and so when we
[54:14] begin to think of what the prophet of
[54:16] god tells us of what the
[54:18] the value of of a human soul
[54:22] is worth to god then we begin to realize
[54:25] that he says that it's worth ten
[54:27] thousand worlds and so uh
[54:30] your value is very great in the eyes of
[54:34] god and so much
[54:35] that uh the that we realize that god
[54:39] shed his own blood amen the bible says
[54:42] you are not your own but that you've
[54:44] been
[54:44] bought with a price amen the precious
[54:48] blood of the lord jesus christ brother
[54:50] brown tells us
[54:51] that that god thought more of you
[54:54] than he did of his own blood and that
[54:56] you are
[54:57] the purchase of his blood amen
[55:01] and so uh so the where
[55:05] we could spend a lot of time on the
[55:06] value of a soul but
[55:08] i just want to focus more
[55:11] on the uh the attention
[55:14] and i'm going to use that word attention
[55:17] what
[55:18] gets god's attention we're preaching
[55:20] tonight on
[55:21] fallen sparrows and so the bible here in
[55:25] matthew's gospel chapter 18 and verse 10
[55:29] it says take heed that you despise
[55:32] not one of these little ones amen do i
[55:35] got any little ones in the house tonight
[55:37] amen
[55:38] amen i believe we're all one of god's
[55:41] little ones and he says
[55:42] uh be uh take heed that you despise
[55:46] not one of these little ones for i say
[55:49] unto you that in heaven
[55:51] that their angels do always behold the
[55:54] face of my father which is in heaven
[55:57] he goes on to say here and he says and
[55:59] again i say unto you that if
[56:01] two of you shall agree on earth as
[56:04] touching anything that they shall ask
[56:07] it shall be done for them of my father
[56:10] which
[56:11] is in heaven the thought and the
[56:13] narrative of the scripture continues to
[56:15] go down
[56:16] and he said for where two or three are
[56:19] gathered together in my name
[56:21] there i am in the midst of them so now
[56:25] then we have this little sparrow
[56:27] that falls from heaven uh for whatever
[56:30] reason
[56:31] and and uh you know in our day you know
[56:33] maybe an automobile or
[56:35] in that day maybe it was an old stray
[56:37] cat or
[56:38] or or something like that that that
[56:40] little bird is going to
[56:41] uh for whatever reason uh a hailstone or
[56:45] i've seen where birds get uh you know
[56:47] fly into uh you know
[56:48] a bad storm and they get uh they get
[56:51] they get uh
[56:52] they get killed you know because of the
[56:53] bad weather or whatever it might be
[56:56] and so that one of these little birds if
[56:58] it would fall to the ground
[57:00] that the eye of god would that he is so
[57:02] omnipotent he's so omniscient
[57:05] that he would look down into the midst
[57:07] of all the chaos and
[57:09] the things that are going on in the
[57:10] world and the wars and the earthquakes
[57:13] the typhoons and
[57:14] and and people's lives and and and and
[57:18] and all the uh the human trafficking and
[57:21] all the heinous crimes
[57:22] that are being committed in the earth
[57:24] but yet god
[57:26] is able to look down through all the
[57:28] myths of all of that
[57:29] and see a little insignificant bird
[57:32] when it would fall to the ground and i
[57:35] began to think about that if god would
[57:38] would do that and that would get god's
[57:40] attention
[57:41] amen a little bird that would fall to
[57:43] the ground and that would get
[57:44] god's attention to the point that he
[57:47] would focus on that little bird
[57:49] amen and it would so inspire a man
[57:52] that he would he would think i want to
[57:54] be in the presence of god
[57:56] so much i want to i want to be in the
[57:58] focus
[57:59] of god that i would want to horn in on
[58:02] the death of a little bird
[58:04] and i would want to i would want to get
[58:06] myself close to where
[58:07] i know scripturally where god's looking
[58:10] at
[58:11] i would want to get right there and
[58:12] stand by that because i want to be in
[58:14] the attention of god
[58:16] i want to catch god's attention some way
[58:18] somehow
[58:19] i want god to look down and see me and
[58:22] to know
[58:23] that i'm thinking about him and that i'm
[58:25] looking for his attention
[58:27] and for his approval and for his love
[58:29] and for his understanding in my life i
[58:32] want god to look down
[58:33] and see i want to be near one of those
[58:36] fallen sparrows
[58:41] and he said where two or three of these
[58:44] little ones
[58:46] are gathered in my name there i will be
[58:50] in the midst of them
[58:52] friend i got to thinking about that and
[58:54] i said you know
[58:55] how many times have we looked out over a
[58:57] congregation where
[58:59] you know we got half the church not here
[59:01] this evening
[59:03] when the whole church ought to be here
[59:06] they really ought to be here because the
[59:07] bible says where two or three are
[59:09] gathered in his name
[59:10] he said to forsake not the assembling of
[59:13] yourselves together
[59:14] and so when i think about that and the
[59:16] bible says
[59:17] tells us that they're they're they're
[59:19] they're where
[59:20] these two are gathered or three are
[59:22] gathered
[59:24] jesus is going to be there
[59:28] now you know that may be an excuse for a
[59:31] small
[59:32] congregation or just a small gathering
[59:34] but
[59:35] to me it's it's an invitation amen into
[59:39] the presence of god
[59:40] it's an invitation to get his attention
[59:44] because i want to be this i don't know
[59:46] about you but i just want to be spoilt
[59:50] i want to be one of those little spoiled
[59:52] children in the house of god
[59:54] that's always got daddy's attention
[59:58] willing to do anything anytime i want
[1:00:01] the attention of god
[1:00:02] i want him looking at me all the time
[1:00:05] thinking about me
[1:00:06] all the time that whatever hey you know
[1:00:09] that deal boy he's something else
[1:00:12] you know where two or three earth that
[1:00:14] he's always there
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:17] you know where a sparrow's fallen he's
[1:00:19] always there
[1:00:20] where they're sick and someone's hurting
[1:00:22] he's always there
[1:00:23] oh my whether there's a where there's
[1:00:25] pain or suffering uh i hope i'm not the
[1:00:27] cause of it
[1:00:30] but but they're always nearby
[1:00:34] because i want to be in the in i want to
[1:00:36] be where god's doing something
[1:00:38] when god's doing something i want to be
[1:00:40] nearby
[1:00:48] when there's a gathering brother brown
[1:00:49] tells us that if the holy ghost is in
[1:00:51] your soul
[1:00:53] he said you just can't wait
[1:00:57] for the church doors to open
[1:01:01] i believe that we should gather even the
[1:01:04] much more
[1:01:05] as we see that day approaching the much
[1:01:09] more
[1:01:10] if there's ever any place you know they
[1:01:12] can have their rally out here they can
[1:01:14] sit on the courthouse steps they can
[1:01:16] walk up and down the street with their
[1:01:18] picket signs they can go to washington
[1:01:20] dc
[1:01:20] they can break in the capitol building
[1:01:22] they can do whatever they
[1:01:24] want to but at the end of the day
[1:01:26] friends
[1:01:27] i want to be where jesus is i want to be
[1:01:30] gathered right in the middle of where
[1:01:32] the attention of god
[1:01:34] is focused well he said he would be in
[1:01:36] the midst of them where two or
[1:01:38] three are gathered in his name i want to
[1:01:40] be somewhere close by
[1:01:43] the bible says in psalms chapter 33 and
[1:01:46] verse 18 he said behold the eye of the
[1:01:50] lord
[1:01:51] is upon them that fear him
[1:01:55] now then that word their fear is not
[1:01:58] like afraid like
[1:01:59] scared or petrified or terrified or
[1:02:02] or something like that but it literally
[1:02:04] means that it
[1:02:06] it means respect is the bait
[1:02:09] is the basic word for that that word is
[1:02:11] upon them that
[1:02:12] respect him that reverence him that are
[1:02:15] humbled in his presence
[1:02:17] i want to be near somebody like that why
[1:02:19] because the eye of the lord
[1:02:21] is upon those that are respectful to god
[1:02:24] you've got so many today
[1:02:25] that are disrespectful you've got so
[1:02:28] many comedians that are supposed to be
[1:02:30] you know christian comedians i i i guess
[1:02:33] you know some of the things that they
[1:02:34] say are funny and
[1:02:35] funny things happen in church but let me
[1:02:38] tell you a lot of the things they say
[1:02:39] are sacrilege
[1:02:41] a lot of the things that they say just
[1:02:43] are are are not
[1:02:44] worth repeating or are not edifying but
[1:02:47] what but
[1:02:48] and many times we find that there's uh
[1:02:50] you know there's just
[1:02:51] uh uh people that will say derogatory
[1:02:54] things about church and church people
[1:02:56] and god and
[1:02:57] and the holy spirit and and the bible
[1:03:00] and these kind of things
[1:03:01] i don't want to be around people like
[1:03:03] that i don't want to be gathered in that
[1:03:05] kind of an atmosphere i want to be
[1:03:07] gathered around those
[1:03:09] amen that are reverent before god that
[1:03:11] are humbled in his presence
[1:03:13] that'll that'll reverence himself and
[1:03:16] say
[1:03:16] amen to the word of god
[1:03:20] watch what it says here his eye
[1:03:25] is upon them that fear him
[1:03:28] and watch right here comment there upon
[1:03:31] them
[1:03:33] that hope in his mercy
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:38] my as i begin to look at that
[1:03:45] the english word hope there is really
[1:03:50] uh it's not it's not really
[1:03:54] it's not adequate because
[1:03:59] not so much because the bible's wrong
[1:04:00] but because men's mind's wrong
[1:04:03] because they're hoping hope is brother
[1:04:07] said it said hopes on the outside
[1:04:10] looking in he said but faith on the
[1:04:13] inside looking out
[1:04:15] you see faith's already possessor and so
[1:04:17] this word
[1:04:18] the the english word hope there but
[1:04:21] i i thought it was striking when i went
[1:04:23] back and looked into the he
[1:04:24] and the hebrew uh uh
[1:04:28] definition there the word there is
[1:04:31] actually
[1:04:32] weight those that
[1:04:36] wait upon the lord and actually means to
[1:04:39] patiently wait and so the eye of the
[1:04:43] lord is upon them that fear him
[1:04:46] and upon them that patiently wait
[1:04:50] and that word mercy there it literally
[1:04:54] means
[1:04:56] loving kindness so those that
[1:04:59] patiently wait in
[1:05:02] you notice the language there in
[1:05:05] his mercy and so they're patiently
[1:05:08] they're in that loving kindness they're
[1:05:11] they're patiently waiting in it so
[1:05:14] they're now they're already possessers
[1:05:17] and so
[1:05:17] to get when you're in that loving
[1:05:20] kindness his eyes are on you
[1:05:22] yeah because the bible says his eye
[1:05:24] beholds them that fear him
[1:05:26] and upon them that are are in their
[1:05:29] their that are patiently waiting
[1:05:33] within that loving kindness
[1:05:36] that word their mercy
[1:05:39] specifically means in redemption
[1:05:45] from enemies and troubles
[1:05:48] his loving-kindness is his redemption
[1:05:52] from enemies and troubles
[1:05:56] his eye is upon them that are that when
[1:05:59] they're surrounded
[1:06:01] by on every side when the when the enemy
[1:06:05] is coming in like a flood when plagues
[1:06:08] and pestilence
[1:06:09] when when political upheaval when
[1:06:12] there's
[1:06:12] wars and and and violence and everything
[1:06:16] all around us oh let me tell you his
[1:06:19] eyes
[1:06:19] upon them that are patiently waiting
[1:06:22] in his loving kindness that are waiting
[1:06:25] patiently within the realms
[1:06:28] of redemption that they have found
[1:06:32] their kinsmen redeemer they have found
[1:06:35] amen their bow has
[1:06:36] and they're resting patiently amen for
[1:06:39] him to do his work
[1:06:41] he said wait here amen and she and naomi
[1:06:44] said
[1:06:45] wait here because he will not rest
[1:06:48] until he has performed amen what he said
[1:06:51] he would do
[1:06:52] and i'm patiently waiting amen for god
[1:06:55] to do
[1:06:56] what he patiently amen what he said that
[1:06:58] he would do
[1:07:00] i'm waiting patiently lord why when i do
[1:07:03] his eyes are upon me
[1:07:07] oh i thank god amen that i'm waiting
[1:07:11] patiently because i know he will perform
[1:07:14] what he said he will do
[1:07:16] amen redemption
[1:07:20] from my enemies and from my troubles
[1:07:26] it goes on to say here that men
[1:07:29] should trust in it
[1:07:32] trust in his lovingkindness trust in his
[1:07:36] mercy
[1:07:37] amen oh my they have a uh they have a
[1:07:41] thing where
[1:07:42] you uh i i don't know where
[1:07:45] it's uh they do it in like business
[1:07:48] meetings and motivational type things
[1:07:50] and in
[1:07:51] in uh marriage seminars and things like
[1:07:54] this
[1:07:55] and they and they actually have a person
[1:07:58] to stand
[1:07:59] on a box or on a chair and they
[1:08:02] blindfold them
[1:08:04] and then now they they have to say now
[1:08:06] then you have to trust us
[1:08:08] you have to trust your husband you have
[1:08:10] to trust your wife you have to trust
[1:08:11] this person
[1:08:13] and or this group of people and you're
[1:08:15] going to
[1:08:16] blindfold it now you're just going to
[1:08:17] fall backwards
[1:08:20] and these people are going to catch you
[1:08:21] and you have to trust us and so they
[1:08:23] have to get over that
[1:08:25] that fear that that fear of falling that
[1:08:27] fear of injury that fear
[1:08:29] and they're going to fall into the these
[1:08:32] arms that are that are there and they're
[1:08:33] there and they're told that they would
[1:08:34] they would be there to catch them and
[1:08:38] and and so so they have to they have to
[1:08:40] break
[1:08:41] you know that that so they have to put
[1:08:43] their trust in that person that's going
[1:08:45] to catch them
[1:08:52] but there's the possibility
[1:08:55] that that person would not be there
[1:08:58] there because maybe at that moment it
[1:09:00] would be there but maybe the next time
[1:09:02] they wouldn't be or maybe that person
[1:09:05] because of human weakness or because of
[1:09:08] death or because of of uh you know
[1:09:11] backsliding or whatever the case might
[1:09:13] be that there's going to come a day that
[1:09:15] that person
[1:09:17] you would lose confidence in that person
[1:09:19] that they wouldn't be there even though
[1:09:21] it may be
[1:09:22] your dearest friend or your your most
[1:09:24] your soul mate in this world or
[1:09:26] whatever the case may be people are
[1:09:29] going to fail you
[1:09:31] amen and the bible says that it's not
[1:09:34] wise to put your confidence or your
[1:09:36] trust in the arm of the flesh
[1:09:39] even though we want to trust one another
[1:09:41] we want to have confidence that that
[1:09:42] person will be there or they'll pray for
[1:09:44] it when they say they will
[1:09:45] or whatever those things might be but
[1:09:47] the but the scripture here
[1:09:49] it tells us that his eyes upon them that
[1:09:52] that uh
[1:09:52] patiently wait for his loving kindness
[1:09:55] and
[1:09:56] and and that men should trust
[1:09:59] in it
[1:10:02] trust in the lord put your confidence
[1:10:06] there
[1:10:07] he won't fail you he's never
[1:10:10] failed me yet he won't fail you he
[1:10:15] can't fail you why because his eye the
[1:10:17] one that's on the sparrow
[1:10:19] he's on the he's on the needs of his
[1:10:22] children
[1:10:22] he's on the needs of his of these ones
[1:10:25] that
[1:10:26] you're much more valuable than many
[1:10:29] sparrows
[1:10:34] men should rejoice in it
[1:10:42] rejoice in the lord always
[1:10:46] in first peter chapter 3 and verse 12
[1:10:51] the bible says for the eyes of the lord
[1:10:54] are over the righteous amen
[1:10:58] all right think about that that what
[1:11:01] gets god's attention
[1:11:03] is the eyes of the lord
[1:11:06] and his ear is open unto their prayer
[1:11:12] but did you notice here in this
[1:11:13] scripture
[1:11:16] that these other the other side of the
[1:11:18] coin is not
[1:11:22] invisible to god we wonder about
[1:11:26] you know these other things the what the
[1:11:29] you know the the the
[1:11:30] the ungodly the bible says if the
[1:11:33] righteous
[1:11:34] scarcely be saved where will the sinner
[1:11:36] and the ungodly appear they appear right
[1:11:38] here in the face of god
[1:11:40] god sees these you think that god
[1:11:42] doesn't know that they
[1:11:44] they they rigged an election
[1:11:47] it's not the first time
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:51] they did it before in the days when
[1:11:53] brother branham voted
[1:11:54] for richard nixon he said they rigged it
[1:11:58] he said they knew that they voted for
[1:12:00] kennedy four times to the one of richard
[1:12:02] nixon he said the fbi
[1:12:04] investigated and proved it he said but
[1:12:06] they didn't do
[1:12:08] anything about it so do you think this
[1:12:11] day is
[1:12:12] any different it's not any different
[1:12:15] this is not
[1:12:16] our world the kingdoms of this world
[1:12:19] shall sin before him fall amen i'm not
[1:12:23] looking for uh of some sort of
[1:12:26] vindication that
[1:12:28] that this uh administration was good
[1:12:31] bad or otherwise i'm not interested in
[1:12:34] that
[1:12:34] i'm interested in one thing let me be in
[1:12:37] the center
[1:12:38] of god's attention nothing else
[1:12:41] matters but you think that god didn't
[1:12:45] see these things before they happened
[1:12:47] what kind of god do we serve
[1:12:50] if they just caught god off guard you
[1:12:52] think the lord jesus didn't know
[1:12:54] before the foundation of the world that
[1:12:56] we were going to have a bunch of
[1:12:58] criminals
[1:12:58] a bunch of whoremongers a bunch of liars
[1:13:01] and deceivers
[1:13:02] in the politics of this government don't
[1:13:04] you think that god
[1:13:06] already knew before there was ever amen
[1:13:08] specus stardust that he knew
[1:13:11] but he also knew that he was going to
[1:13:13] have a righteous seed
[1:13:15] upon the earth and his eye was going to
[1:13:17] be on him
[1:13:19] hallelujah and he said i'll get you
[1:13:21] through this persecutions will come
[1:13:23] tribulation will come amen amen
[1:13:26] i'll be with you even in you
[1:13:34] glory to god watch this
[1:13:39] but the face of the lord
[1:13:43] is against them that do evil
[1:13:48] they're not getting away with anything
[1:13:51] those those people that they they rigged
[1:13:54] the election that
[1:13:55] did those that cast all those illegal
[1:13:57] votes and that
[1:13:58] that counted all those uh that that
[1:14:01] perversion and all that stuff that went
[1:14:03] on there
[1:14:04] they ain't getting away with anything
[1:14:07] oh but they're gonna put a bad man in
[1:14:09] the office they had a bad man in the
[1:14:11] office to start with
[1:14:15] there's no difference it's pot calling
[1:14:18] kiddo black on this deal
[1:14:21] you know one's gonna you know i just i
[1:14:23] just don't believe in
[1:14:24] this news and politics is a bunch of
[1:14:28] nonsense get your eyes on the thing that
[1:14:31] matters the reveal word of the
[1:14:33] hour that's where god's attention is wow
[1:14:37] he said i will see my word brother jason
[1:14:40] and i will
[1:14:41] bring it to pass i will perform it
[1:14:45] amen hallelujah
[1:14:55] i want to inject something here
[1:14:59] peter was actually quoting from the old
[1:15:01] testament
[1:15:02] if you want to go and read that it's in
[1:15:04] psalms 34.
[1:15:07] and uh he he quotes it verbatim but then
[1:15:11] verse 16 says this i'll i'll finish up
[1:15:14] there he said but the face of the lord
[1:15:15] is against them that do evil watch what
[1:15:17] he says in verse 16.
[1:15:20] the face of the lord is against them
[1:15:21] that do evil to what
[1:15:25] amen amen we're uh
[1:15:29] i'm at uh 3416.
[1:15:33] uh to cut off the remembrance of them
[1:15:38] from the earth i might give you a wrong
[1:15:40] chapter and verse probably maybe i don't
[1:15:41] know
[1:15:44] 32. psalms 34 16.
[1:15:49] i i might i
[1:15:52] sometimes i yes there we go
[1:15:56] look what it says here the face of the
[1:15:57] lord is against them that do evil
[1:16:00] what have we been saying what to cut off
[1:16:03] the
[1:16:04] what the remembrance of
[1:16:08] them from the earth
[1:16:11] i'm here to tell you church that his eye
[1:16:14] is on the righteous
[1:16:16] his eye is on amen those that call upon
[1:16:19] his name
[1:16:19] his eyes upon those that gather in his
[1:16:22] name his eye is on them
[1:16:24] and they shall establish amen blessed
[1:16:27] are they merciful
[1:16:28] amen for they shall obtain mercy oh let
[1:16:31] me tell you friends
[1:16:32] there's going to be a people that will
[1:16:34] inherit the earth but those that do
[1:16:36] wickedly
[1:16:37] the bible says that at one point there
[1:16:41] they won't even be remembered on the
[1:16:43] earth
[1:16:45] amen so it just depends on
[1:16:49] what kind of attention you want to get
[1:16:51] from god
[1:16:53] where do you want to be standing
[1:16:57] i got to thinking about that you know
[1:17:03] the bible says that if you're if you're
[1:17:05] sick
[1:17:08] call for the elders of the church now
[1:17:12] that is one of the great benefits
[1:17:14] of being a preacher
[1:17:18] that's right think about it that every
[1:17:21] time
[1:17:22] we get a little wounded sparrow that the
[1:17:24] preacher gets to stand next to him
[1:17:28] amen every time there's a sick person
[1:17:31] brother jason i can stand by every time
[1:17:34] there's a hurting person
[1:17:36] that needs prayer every time there's a
[1:17:38] mother that's praying for his children
[1:17:40] i get to stand next to him they asked
[1:17:43] for the preacher to come and to lay
[1:17:45] hands on
[1:17:45] i get to sit next to him i get to stand
[1:17:47] next to him i get to pray for him
[1:17:49] amen god's eye is on that person and
[1:17:52] somehow or another
[1:17:53] there we go so then now then we realize
[1:17:56] that uh you know when somebody asks you
[1:17:58] to pray for them how important that is
[1:18:00] for that person to get prayed for
[1:18:02] but let me tell you friends there's a
[1:18:03] benefit to that
[1:18:05] that you get to get next to that little
[1:18:07] fallen sparrow
[1:18:09] it's your opportunity to be next to that
[1:18:11] one that's afflicted
[1:18:13] oh my you get you you know uh uh
[1:18:16] you get you get a a mother that's uh
[1:18:19] that's agonizing for
[1:18:20] lost children oh my get next to that
[1:18:23] sister god's looking down there
[1:18:25] you'll get that brother that's that's
[1:18:27] that's been afflicted with a with this
[1:18:29] coveted or something like
[1:18:30] it's an opportunity that we have to get
[1:18:33] next to them
[1:18:34] and to pray for them and to agonize with
[1:18:37] them and feel their pain with them why
[1:18:39] because god
[1:18:40] knows and god's looking down when
[1:18:42] somebody's hurting
[1:18:46] god knows when you're suffering his eye
[1:18:49] is on the sparrow
[1:18:50] how much more is he on you or me i
[1:18:54] wonder sometimes
[1:18:55] if we don't miss
[1:18:58] an opportunity we miss
[1:19:02] an opportunity to be in the center
[1:19:06] of god's attention
[1:19:11] brother brown tells a little story and
[1:19:12] god keeps his word in 1957 he says
[1:19:15] he was up in the arm of the of the uh of
[1:19:18] the statue of liberty
[1:19:21] and that's back when you could go up in
[1:19:22] the arm and look in the viewing uh there
[1:19:24] at the where the light is
[1:19:27] and as they were brother bam was looking
[1:19:29] there he looked out on there's like a
[1:19:31] gangplank around the outside of that and
[1:19:32] there was a bunch of little birds that
[1:19:34] were laying there dead
[1:19:36] and brother brown asked if they got
[1:19:39] killed during the storm and
[1:19:41] the the guide there says no
[1:19:44] he said there was a storm there last
[1:19:46] night and in the storm these little
[1:19:48] birds
[1:19:50] flew into the light and instead of
[1:19:53] using the light to go to safety they
[1:19:55] tried
[1:19:56] to beat the light out with their little
[1:19:59] wings
[1:20:00] and they beat their brains out
[1:20:04] brother brown goes on he says now don't
[1:20:06] try to beat your brains out
[1:20:08] to make god's word say something that it
[1:20:10] doesn't
[1:20:11] don't try to cope with societies of this
[1:20:14] day
[1:20:15] can we say amen to that we're not here
[1:20:18] to cope with societies and
[1:20:20] and political parties and and movements
[1:20:23] of this
[1:20:24] earth you know and and whatever uh you
[1:20:27] know uh
[1:20:27] someone align themselves with the
[1:20:31] you know the nra and boy if you're not a
[1:20:33] nra member while you're
[1:20:35] you know you're you're not even american
[1:20:37] another one over here is want to be with
[1:20:39] the blm and this and all the lbg
[1:20:42] rst or whatever they are and all these
[1:20:44] different things and you've got to align
[1:20:46] yourself somehow
[1:20:47] with one of these alphabets nice
[1:20:50] brother man said it's he said don't try
[1:20:53] to cope with these societies of this day
[1:20:56] because
[1:20:57] if you love the world or the things of
[1:20:59] the
[1:21:00] world the love of god isn't in you
[1:21:03] he said why not just take the gospel
[1:21:06] light
[1:21:07] and use it to fly to safety
[1:21:10] instead they're trying to beat their
[1:21:12] brains out trying to stop
[1:21:14] the light to close down the church to
[1:21:16] you know to
[1:21:17] to keep us all at home in quarantine or
[1:21:19] whatever the case might be and
[1:21:21] social distance that and whatever more
[1:21:23] and you know no doubt there's certain
[1:21:25] health benefits to some of those things
[1:21:27] i don't argue with that kind of stuff
[1:21:29] but what i do say is we ought to take
[1:21:31] the word of god
[1:21:32] and use it to fly to safety all right
[1:21:35] amen instead of trying to beat the thing
[1:21:38] out
[1:21:38] we'll beat our brains out and the light
[1:21:40] will still be shining
[1:21:43] amen god knows
[1:21:47] so little sparrows tonight use the light
[1:21:51] to fly to safety the bible says
[1:21:55] amen the bible the bible is is is full
[1:21:58] of precious
[1:21:59] promises and he said
[1:22:02] it's a light to your feet
[1:22:06] it's a lamp to your feet it's a light to
[1:22:08] your path
[1:22:10] what is it use it to fly to safety
[1:22:15] brother man says this i just love this
[1:22:18] quote
[1:22:21] he says now maybe the devil has caught
[1:22:24] you out somewhere
[1:22:26] and give you a disease or some sickness
[1:22:30] or you're backslid or
[1:22:34] something like that remember
[1:22:39] he climbed the ramparts of glory
[1:22:42] and sitting on high his eye is on the
[1:22:46] spiral
[1:22:48] and i know he watches me
[1:22:52] he goes on here
[1:22:55] he is from everlasting brother matthew
[1:22:59] to everlasting

[1:23:19] a mind of its own

[1:23:26] way
[1:23:27] that he reads this and i or that he
[1:23:30] quotes this or says this
[1:23:32] i'm quoting the way he said it
[1:23:35] he steps up and he's watching you
[1:23:39] he sees where you're at
[1:23:42] amen well i can see where you're at
[1:23:46] but jason's sitting over here in the
[1:23:47] corner these folks sitting right here on
[1:23:49] the second row

[1:23:52] row and they got i know where these ones
[1:23:54] are and you're and that's
[1:23:55] geographically where you're at
[1:23:58] right that doesn't mean that i'm
[1:24:01] omnipotent
[1:24:02] or omnipresent
[1:24:06] but this one that sets on high
[1:24:09] whose eye is on the sparrow
[1:24:14] and he is from everlasting to
[1:24:15] everlasting his alpha and omega is the
[1:24:17] beginning of the end he's everything in
[1:24:19] between as brother matthew said on
[1:24:20] sunday
[1:24:21] he's all those kind of things but what
[1:24:23] is so amazing to me
[1:24:28] he knows exactly where you're at
[1:24:32] amen
[1:24:35] and he's not talking about your

[1:24:57] everything that there is to know the
[1:24:59] inside the outside he's the word of god
[1:25:01] and he's sharper than any two-edged
[1:25:03] sword
[1:25:04] he's cutting asunder to the bone the
[1:25:06] moral he's getting rid of all the filth
[1:25:08] and all the fluff and he's getting down
[1:25:10] right down and the bible says he
[1:25:11] discerns the thoughts

[1:28:14] in
[1:28:14] tune you're in harmony with the composer
[1:28:17] and the director is directing he said

[1:28:34] knows tonight
[1:28:36] if you're interested in the things of
[1:28:38] god or if you're just here to pass some
[1:28:40] time
[1:28:40] or just to hold a good standing in the
[1:28:42] neighborhood or to keep the deacon from
[1:28:44] calling you or the pastor from

[1:28:49] i'm here to tell you friends
[1:28:50] that god is interested in you and he

[1:29:02] hello amen he knows if you're interested
[1:29:05] in the kingdom of god
[1:29:07] well everybody well i want to go to
[1:29:08] heaven but you know
[1:29:12] all this missionary stuff i don't know
[1:29:16] i don't know if i want to invest in that
[1:29:18] or not
[1:29:19] i got other things i could be doing with
[1:29:21] my money
[1:29:26] we're talking about the kingdom right
[1:29:29] you say well
[1:29:30] well the kingdom having a bigger church
[1:29:32] or a bigger building or
[1:29:33] expanding or a building or whatever and
[1:29:35] and having a bigger organization and
[1:29:37] having a church bus
[1:29:38] and all this other no friends i'm not
[1:29:40] talking about that
[1:29:42] i'm talking about the kingdom of god and
[1:29:44] that that kingdom will be inhabited with
[1:29:46] people
[1:29:46] and those people will get there because
[1:29:48] they heard the gospel
[1:29:50] and they heard the gospel because
[1:29:51] somebody was sent
[1:29:54] and there was people that couldn't go so
[1:29:55] they sent somebody
[1:29:57] yeah right and then and that's the
[1:29:59] kingdom of god amen
[1:30:01] it comes many times without observation
[1:30:05] but the bible
[1:30:06] amen shows us that that we must be
[1:30:09] witnesses in our jerusalem in our
[1:30:12] samaria
[1:30:13] and into the uttermost parts of the
[1:30:14] earth and this church i know
[1:30:16] for years and years has been a
[1:30:18] missionary missionary-minded church
[1:30:20] they've supported
[1:30:21] missions and things around the world and
[1:30:23] many souls
[1:30:24] will be attributed to the direct amen
[1:30:27] work
[1:30:27] and the responsibility that this church
[1:30:30] took to send
[1:30:31] missionaries into the foreign fields and
[1:30:33] that's never been a
[1:30:35] a criticism but only appraised to this
[1:30:38] church
[1:30:38] but individually we must have the bible
[1:30:41] brother
[1:30:42] adam tells us that every soul that is
[1:30:44] without christ
[1:30:46] is a mission field you're all called to
[1:30:48] be missionaries
[1:30:53] there's just not near enough people in
[1:30:55] this church
[1:30:57] and that you're responsible to get them
[1:30:59] brother man said you haven't got any
[1:31:00] right to call yourself a christian
[1:31:03] if you're not winning souls to christ
[1:31:06] and that don't mean you're going out
[1:31:07] here witnessing handing out flyers and
[1:31:08] all those kind of things but the life
[1:31:10] that you live in the face of this
[1:31:12] community
[1:31:13] is preaching a louder sermon that many
[1:31:15] times that we'll ever be able to do from
[1:31:17] this pulpit
[1:31:22] god is concerned
[1:31:26] about the smallest things
[1:31:30] is concerned i love this quote enough to
[1:31:32] make
[1:31:33] god is concerned enough to take pity on
[1:31:36] an ignorant
[1:31:37] possum how much more does he think about
[1:31:41] a son or daughter of god who is in need
[1:31:45] watch this brother brown says this this
[1:31:48] really blessed me today
[1:31:49] felt to share it that's what he said
[1:31:54] i am told that a snake can catch the eye
[1:31:57] of a bird
[1:31:59] and charm that bird with its
[1:32:01] enchantments
[1:32:02] and the stare of its eyes until in such
[1:32:05] a way that if that bird will give the
[1:32:07] snake its attention
[1:32:08] for just a few minutes that bird will
[1:32:12] flutter and
[1:32:13] completely become paralyzed
[1:32:16] and the snake will take that bird
[1:32:20] he says and i can believe that
[1:32:24] why because brother baby's first bible
[1:32:25] was nature is that right
[1:32:27] he said i can believe that because that
[1:32:29] i know another
[1:32:31] serpent the devil
[1:32:35] that if he can ever catch the eye
[1:32:38] with his enchantments with your modern
[1:32:42] rock and roll and all your fandangles
[1:32:45] now
[1:32:45] we could put a definition on fandangle
[1:32:47] but i'll let you
[1:32:48] use your imagination
[1:32:53] the the fandangles of the world what is
[1:32:55] that it's
[1:32:56] it's whatever enticement
[1:32:59] that the devil can use to get your
[1:33:02] attention just for a moment
[1:33:04] amen we have to protect our children
[1:33:08] from the fandangles of the world because
[1:33:09] they're helpless little birds
[1:33:12] and they don't know many times they
[1:33:14] don't even have the holy ghost and so
[1:33:16] when when those fandangles and all these
[1:33:18] uh you know video games and all this
[1:33:21] uh you know hollywood and all these kind
[1:33:23] of things they it catches their little
[1:33:25] eye
[1:33:26] brother baby says that just one time
[1:33:28] that a child can hear
[1:33:30] the beat of that rock and roll music and
[1:33:32] they'll catch them and put a spirit on
[1:33:35] amen that's why we have to be careful
[1:33:39] amen what we listen to
[1:33:44] he said if he can catch your eye
[1:33:48] why do you think that the devil he
[1:33:51] couldn't just have
[1:33:52] simple old-fashioned
[1:33:55] sassafras two-by-four
[1:33:59] you know kind of preaching spitting and
[1:34:02] slobbering and beating on the pulpit
[1:34:04] and calling sinners to repentance that's
[1:34:07] what god does
[1:34:08] the the the the word can only produce
[1:34:11] an acts 2 38 a shouting crying
[1:34:15] tongue-talking bunch of miserable
[1:34:17] creatures that's what the world that's
[1:34:19] the only thing the word can produce
[1:34:22] amen 1965 by the way
[1:34:25] uh uh but but what does the devil do
[1:34:28] the devil takes him down and and put
[1:34:31] some crazy looking haircut on some
[1:34:34] wild child preacher up there puts him in
[1:34:36] a t-shirt and a pair of flip-flops
[1:34:38] and puts him out there with no pulpit
[1:34:40] carrying a little bitty bible around
[1:34:43] and got all kinds of smoke and lights
[1:34:45] and all kind of a rock and roll band
[1:34:47] behind him and backing him up
[1:34:48] and what is it it's catching the eye of
[1:34:51] the people
[1:34:52] it's a bunch of entertainment it's not
[1:34:55] preaching the gospel
[1:34:56] pulling the gloves off and bare fists
[1:34:59] preaching
[1:34:59] the word of god and telling sinners to
[1:35:02] repent
[1:35:04] but they don't want that kind of
[1:35:05] preaching no more they don't want that
[1:35:07] kind of singing
[1:35:09] old-fashioned down-home type uh
[1:35:12] congregationals oh no no no that's way
[1:35:15] too
[1:35:16] what brother brown says too far out of
[1:35:17] the realms
[1:35:19] of their modern worldly society
[1:35:25] but you look what's pulling in the big
[1:35:27] crowds
[1:35:28] the big names and the big numbers it's
[1:35:31] fandangles
[1:35:33] that catches the eye of the people watch
[1:35:35] what brother brown says if he can
[1:35:37] ever catch you young lady or young man
[1:35:41] long enough to get his charm in you
[1:35:46] you'll flutter but you can't get loose
[1:35:51] he'll hold you until he swallows
[1:35:55] you up in sin
[1:36:01] the quote goes on the only way i'm told
[1:36:03] that a little bird
[1:36:05] ever has a chance are you listening
[1:36:08] little birds
[1:36:10] is to get his eyes off of the serpent
[1:36:15] and he cannot look at anything else
[1:36:17] because he stands there staring
[1:36:19] but if he'll take his eyes from the
[1:36:22] serpent
[1:36:22] and look upward and flutter his wings
[1:36:26] he'll fly plum out of the reach of the
[1:36:29] snake
[1:36:30] and if you ever got the charm of the
[1:36:32] world of the things of the world
[1:36:34] and unbelief charming around your heart
[1:36:37] and tells you
[1:36:38] oh live modern shake your head tonight
[1:36:43] and look up to the unseen one the lord
[1:36:46] jesus
[1:36:46] and flutter your wings of prayer
[1:36:51] and until you fly plum out of his reach
[1:36:53] and out of his clutches
[1:36:56] all by the world is all around us just
[1:36:59] look up children
[1:37:00] your your redemption draweth now and
[1:37:03] begin to flutter your little wings
[1:37:05] amen of prayer and begin to fly out of
[1:37:08] his presence
[1:37:11] sing and rejoice o daughter of zion for
[1:37:14] lo
[1:37:14] i am come and i will dwell in the midst
[1:37:18] of these saith the lord zechariah 2 10.
[1:37:22] brother talks about his eye being on the
[1:37:25] sparrow
[1:37:25] and his eye on the hebrew children
[1:37:29] listen to what brother says he said i
[1:37:31] can hear him
[1:37:32] say i can't let you go
[1:37:37] you he's talking about those those
[1:37:38] angels and
[1:37:40] michael came and wormwood came and they
