God do you feel privileged today say I have access to that same faith that raised Jesus from the dead it's yours it's available but you have to Avail yourself of it amen praise the Lord we're going to use some of that Faith here and we're going to pray a couple of several prayer requests here sister Jennifer sent in I would like to put in a prayer request for my cousin Holly she she's lost her job completely now needs God's will his provision for a new one also we want to pray for sister Linda Maxwell sister Meredith has went up and brother John had to get her halfway there there was a it was a quite a trip and and short notice and she went up earlier than she had planned so I want to be praying for that whole journey and as the Lord would touch sister Linda amen she's a dear friend to us here and we sure are looking to the Lord for her there is the need for the continuing prayer for sister Solas there and brother Mike Wallace church and the doctors have pretty well as far as all of those Physicians they've given a Hope on her but as long as the great physician is still on the throne we're never without hope amen praise the lord we were without hope in the world Amen but God rich in Mercy cared he cares about you he cares about his people brother Branham took a whole Sermon Just to preach on just that concept he cares amen said oh my does he care does he care and he goes back in the scriptures and it takes case after case after case brings it into the modern day takes a story of testimonies right happening around his ministry he said God cared God cares said but you need to care first he'll care that you have to care first now if you care enough today to say Lord I came here to church and I need you I need you Jesus I'm here to tell you he'll care for you and we all

looking to you father you're the one sometimes Lord You're The Last Hope but lord it's it's our best one sometimes God eliminates everything around us so we can get down to our our best hope and that's in Christ we commit these needs to your hands and now Lord the word coming forth take your word heal the people cleanse hearts and Minds renew restore father let let your word have its complete Liberty bless your speaker bless the hearers of the word the prophet taught us that no matter how anointed that brother Barry is no matter how you came to him in the back office and in the motel and

the audience today with Open Hearts to receive your word Lord oh let's raise our hands friends and say father my heart and mind is open to you today bring your word to me Lord God help us now we pray admit it to you master in Jesus name amen amen amen let's sing some more change [Music] make it ever true I think so change my heart oh God [Music] may I be like you [Music] change my heart oh God make it ever true change my heart oh God may I be like you [Music] you know a lot of times we ask questions within ourselves and among ourselves about why this sister Solas why she just given birth to a new baby has three other uh small children the brother Michael who's her husband just was laid off his job so they're out of insurance coverage and you kind of think how how did they not know how why her why now brother Branham said don't do that he said what we need to do is only believe that's what he said brother Burley is today he wrote me and told me he said I can't still can't see out of that left eye that nail hit him and he said but you know he said brother Barry he said I'm not worried I have a piece and he said I have a just a consolation that God's still on the throne and he said I'm not worried about it at all and I said we're going to pray for you brother Burley every day we're going to pray out loud trust that God will touch you and that's God's servant and so the best thing we can do and the best thing you can do is take your need and bring it to him this morning so before we do anything else let's speak to him Heavenly Father we've prayed several times already this morning but I would just like to add my voice and ask your blessing Lord upon this service today I feel like we've already been blessed Lord and just being in the house of the Lord and such a sweet atmosphere and lovely singing father we ask now that you would just take complete control and breathe upon your word this is your word these are your people and I pray you bring the two together now and speak as only you can we commit the many needs Lord that are represented Among Us I commit them to you especially the serious ones Lord that we've talked about and we just want to only believe that all things are possible have your way we pray in Jesus lovely name amen and amen praise the Lord you can be seated for a moment I'll have you standing again in just a moment but musicians thank you you can take your seats there and let's pull up my PowerPoint here if you don't mind and uh I just want to say at the outset my wife and I are always honored to be able to come and spend time with brother Jason sister Debbie and the family in the church and we don't get to do it real often these days but uh we are honored to be able to be with you today and this weekend and uh appreciate the hospitality and the good Fellowship that we always enjoy good to see familiar faces and uh many of you haven't seen in a while but uh like I heard brother Downey say the other day he said you look out the congregation see these folks they've gotten old some of them gotten older and hasn't happened to me because I believe that old age is always five years older than what you are so that's the way I that's the way I look at it now um let's let's do this let's uh slide that ahead there if you don't mind we'll come back to the screen again in a moment here and uh this there we go just a note here that Lord willing we're we're planning uh we're in the final process of planning a trip to Israel in November 23 so it'll be a year from this November and there's a lot of interest there and if if you're interested in doing something like that I think every believer would enjoy a trip to Israel it makes your Bible a different book and uh to be able to go and see not only the past the historical part of Israel but to see prophetically where things are going it's an exciting uh adventure for sure so you can let me know and we'd be certainly honored to have you with us as you know we've been uh involved in the nation of Ukraine uh recently I was there in last September and held a meeting there in the region called The Sea of azov which is on the Black Sea and there are still to our estimation about 120 families that are still little trapped inside Ukraine and their situation is difficult and by God's grace we've been able to channel funds directly to them next Sunday night we're going to have a meeting where we have some people who are from Russia and uh in Ukraine uh who are going to be with us in service in the afternoon and we're going to be given a little special report on on the situation there but this is just a kind of a typical scene from over there and in zaparosa and they're kind of right in the thick of things and you should remember despite all the media and the way things are portrayed you should just remember these Believers in Ukraine they're very solid people very wonderful people and we sure love them now I don't know what happened here but let's just wow this is the nation of Zambia and this is kind of a remote section of Zambia and doing the work with vision books these folks are now receiving new materials they've got if you look in their hand they've got different titles there uh single sermons they have the seals book Church age book all of this is in their language of bimba and most of you don't speak bimba and uh but there's about uh they say about uh three to four million people who speak bimba in that part of the world and there's many Believers over there so they have not had materials in their hands like this for years and years and years and years and so they're very excited about receiving this this new material and uh by God's grace that's that's been ongoing and uh moving all over the place now I don't know what happened here we lost some of our our pictures here I just had a couple of more uh but either way we're here and uh so uh let's begin and if you don't mind uh we'll have you stand to your feet and we'll look in two places in the scripture and we're gonna go uh to Joshua chapter four first of all Joshua the fourth chapter thank you and we'd like to begin reading here in the fourth chapter of Joshua and this is the the passage where the the story where uh the children of Israel have all cleaned past over Jordans what it says in verse one and they're on the other side they're on the uh they're on the uh Israel side of of the river in verse 5 Joshua said unto them Passover before the Ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan and taking up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder so it's 12 men standing on on the bank of the river and they go through and grab a stone according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel that this may be a sign a memorial among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones then you shall answer them that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off and these Stones shall be a memorial unto the children of Israel and the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded and took up 12 Stones Out of the midst of Jordan as the Lord spake unto Joshua according to the number of tribes of the children of Israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged and they laid them down there now this was not their destiny right to be on the banks of the river this was not where they were going to stop this was a memorial of what God did to get them there all right and so he wanted them to remember this place by this Memorial and and put these Stones there and and always remember that God did a great thing here and he wanted the children of Israel to remember that but the idea was that in time to come your children are going to ask you questions and when they do he said you fathers that are gathered he said you tell them this is what happened here now over in Romans chapter 3 and verse 23 and you could all probably quote this for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning now if we can get our screen back up there I'd like to I'd like to jump right in here and uh I'm going to ask you to uh just follow me here as we begin to look at this in um in this morning's context here now let me just uh Bridge a little between last night and this morning here and uh I'm sorry to put so much information in there last night I know some of you were looking at me like is this required for the test and uh but you you have you have the PowerPoint now just trying to cover a lot of ground uh in order to leave things with you here but I just felt uh this morning just to take a little bit of a turn a little bit of a Twist here so that uh we'll we'll go at this from another angle and as a Christian family in today's world it's really important for us to establish priorities for our family and we want to develop first of all faith and spiritual uh principles uh issues in our house as for me and my house we serve the Lord well what does that mean well that means we're going to be a tithe-paying household right we're going to put God first in our finances or uh we're going to uh you know we're going to uh read the word daily we're going to have a family devotion or whatever else we're going to establish certain priorities and make things first in other words we might say well we have family visiting from abroad and they might not be Believers but you know what we're going to go to church anyway wow wow should I not have said that um to me I I I I just we don't we never we in our in our household we just never let a whole lot of things interrupt the the the the routine of going to church I mean it was just hey that's first you know and so uh if they want to come great if they want to stay great there's lots of food in the fridge you know but uh hey we're going to church that's that's who we are is what we do uh in in our house we made decisions about like when we were when our kids were really young it was when the uh you know computers were changing and the internet was coming and all of that and we said we're just not going to focus a whole lot on video on computer games now back then there was only two uh one was the Pac-Man the guy who went like this right and ate everything and the other one was Oregon Trail we turned Oregon Trail into a school event so the kids didn't want to play that and then the other this this guy we just kind of let him go by the wayside now as a result of that our guys became great readers and uh you know they're now today they're very proficient readers and uh you know I was just it was a good decision we never knew the full effect of that decision when we made it we just thought it'd be a good thing but we we put priorities in place and and you got to be proactive in doing that uh if you've never done us a good time to do it and then we developed a Biblical order uh as we said that that we're going to make spiritual things priorities we're going to uh learn about how our finances and how to structure things in a good way and if we don't know we're going to find out we're going to draw from the resources I will guarantee you looking around you have somebody here who knows what they're doing in relation to finances and uh we we explored and and learned and grew and did it ourselves and then shared the uh benefit of that with uh with the church members we we established standards and boundaries and those are good to have the Bible talks about Hedges and hedges are not designed to Rob joy and fun out of your life they're meant to protect you because the Bible says that on the other side of a hedge is trouble and you don't want to get out there in trouble and so we we believed in heaven boundaries like and and that meant that we said we're not we're not going to participate in sleepovers we just never did now I'm not saying you should or shouldn't I'm just saying that we we didn't do a lot of that with our guys if we were gonna if they were gonna go stay with somebody generally we went as well if they were going to be on a campout we went and stayed with them all right I I've spent a lot of a lot of nights in in the sleeping bag in a campout because my boys went through in The Scouting years and uh we we wanted to put boundaries in place so that they knew where their where their area of responsibility was and we tried to make that clear and then we allowed them to remove those boundaries out as they grew older and we tried to practice consistent discipline and try to be fair across the board I found that most often I got the best mileage and pardoned the pun but I got the best bang for the buck when I dealt with my boys one-on-one and it never really as profitable as shame your child in a crowd of siblings amen amen it very often doesn't work and so I would pull my boys aside and talk to them and deal with them and we just had a way of of dealing with discipline you you have you may have your ways this these are all sermons in themselves and if we had time we could go through it uh the the the other thing that in order to accomplish shalom in your household is to learn how to resolve differences in a way that uh the family can move on because there will be differences you're not all the same you don't all think the same and why do you think they have two heat and cool settings in a car nowadays right come on who who invented that but a woman because she she said to her husband hey you're freezing me out and he said I'm sweating to death over here and so we get your own controls all right that's a good idea where do you think those things came from amen uh so you're not the same you have you have uh you know men are different than women and you have uh you have differences and and there's differences as your children get older and uh you know they grow up and they have an opinion and they have a uh you know a thought process and so you have to learn to resolve differences in a way that they don't linger for years and years and years and years and we're still burying the hatchet in somebody's back uh 10 years after this event uh you know we we have to learn to resolve that and these are just some things that are uh that are priorities then you want to do whatever you can to maintain the atmosphere so that the holy spirit's always welcome to come by as we talked about it now brother Branham said it this way he said so we got to think of others that are coming on behind us he said these young people and so forth a place for our children and our daughters we don't want them out in the world in these things like that we want them girls raised like our mothers all right and he says and the Holy Spirit will make all the arrangements for that wow uh somebody's and the pastor will make all the arrangements for them it's not what it says you got to make arrangements for this you've got to learn to be proactive and say hey if we're going to create a a nice place for our young people and we're going to have our daughters raised like our mother then you know what we've got to make decisions we got to sit down and make arrangements for them it is not just automatic and I really disdain the attitude that says well we brought him to church you know and uh we I don't know what happened they just didn't turn out so well well it requires a little bit more than just having your carcass inside the this these four walls it's it's a life that's lived at home it's a a thirst that's created by your your uh integrity and your life and your uh way of living at home it has an effect on your children and so therefore brother bran I'm saying you you got to think about this you got to think about because uh today if if you don't uh get involved and and create that atmosphere in your home and work with your kids provide opportunities for them take them places and go to camps go to different uh things it's not all camps and it's not all uh religious events there are it's important for families to get together and have shared experiences that are enjoyable yeah hello that's all right to do yeah and uh you know to take your boys and go fishing by the river take your girls and and uh take them to a mall and give them 500 each and just let them have at it I mean those are fun things right you know some of you girls got your black belt in shopping and I know that so uh you but you there there are shared positive experiences that families need to have and uh if if we if we don't think about that and do it work and the responsibilities of this world will close in on top of you and your kids in a sense are squeezed out of that that picture so don't leave it to somebody else to make arrangements for that you need to think about that and be proactive and do it that's what brother Branham said now I love this passage here and uh I need you to take a look at it Deuteronomy 4 6 and 8 are important for you there are instructions that uh God gave to Moses to bring into the children of Israel uh and and and Prime them if you like before they cross over into the land Deuteronomy is interesting book because if you go back historically it's the book that Jesus most quoted out of when he was on the earth in his ministry it is a book of of instruction looking forward and God was actually teaching them how to live in another place which is exactly to me what the message does today it teaches us to live in eternity we live by the word here we're going to live by the word there so uh In this passage I love this he says Hear o Israel the Lord your God is one Lord that's a Shema and thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thy children's heart that's not what it says this word that I command thee this day shall be in thine heart who's he speaking to he's speaking to fathers here he's speaking to men and first of all the words got to be in your heart before we go on to any other verse here it's got to be in your heart first before you communicate it to anybody else and then verse 7 thou shall teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk to them without citizen thine house and when they'll walk Us by the way and when thou lie us down and when that rises up so in other words all the time now there's two kinds of speaking in the Old Testament and one of them is the pronouncement of prophets and it's like this thus saith the Lord Israel thou shall hearken unto the Lord thy God and thou shalt repent that's the utterance of a prophet it's formal it is meant for uh these serious dictates that prophets came and did like Elijah on top of Mount Carmel but you know what that's not what this says when it says that thou shalt speak unto thy children Thou shalt talk of them when thou sit us at thy table at your table you don't talk like that you don't say the saith the Lord wife Thou shalt make steak for supper lest you die and uh you know you don't have your children come and kneel before you and lay your hands on them and say thou Wicked Child yeah you know we we that's that's not what that means this word talk here it means the everyday ordinary conversation of people who are just living their life amen and that's the other kind of talk and and this is this is what he wanted him to do you you're not you're not formal all the time you just you know what you include God in everything you talk about you make him the center of things you don't try to add them in he's a center and everything else stems from that does that make sense and and then he says I love this little word in verse 7 here he says thou shall teach them diligently in the Hebrew this this uh word diligent it means sharpen now most of you guys know how to sharpen something like if you're going to sharpen a knife or something and what we would do is we'd take that knife and we'd kind of go like this are you going to whittle a stick or something else you're going to rub on it a little bit you're going to look at it you're gonna rub on it a little bit and then you're going to figure out okay this is good it's good to use do a little bit more I'm going to polish it a little bit and then we're going to use it and you know what after a little while by virtue of use it's going to become dull again you know what we do same thing again we go back and we sharpen it again that's the word diligently that's what he's saying right here thou shall teach thy children diligently because you know what they don't learn everything in one sitting amen get brother Barry down here and teach us everything we'll all know everything so we got it oh hell no it doesn't work that way you need him you need to have him back you need to have other folks back that will help your families and help you help strengthen your relationships you know what Because by the next time I come here happy you'll be pretty dull would have to go back and do it again you know how many times brother Brandon preached influence or how many times he preached Investments right yeah a lot of times you've just you know resharpening just going at it again going at it again and that's what he says thou shall teach them diligently unto thy children have patience work with it get it get it looking good get it usable put it in service and you know what you're going to go back expect to go back again and sharpen it again we're going to remind you of some of these principles here but you know what it's got to be in your heart first dad's it's got to be in your hearts first don't try to convert your kids and tell them to get off the internet when you're on a 23 hours a day right you cannot you cannot teach them uh to be financially responsible if you're buying all the toys that that come out well I maybe I shouldn't say that let's let's go on a little bit more now he says and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and thou shall be as frontless between Thine Eyes which is the blinders that horses have and they put them there the black they're black and they prevent the horses from having any peripheral view of things that are going on if they want the horses to go in a certain direction they put those front let's there so the horses are focused on that direction and I will tell you what if if you let it and you don't use the the frontlets uh you're going to be distracted by all kinds of things that are going on in other places here God's got a Destiny for the people of God God's got a destiny he's got an intent for your family he's got a direction for all of us to walk in and you're better off minimizing the distractions that are so readily there to pull us away and thou shall write them upon the post of thy house you need to make sure that everybody coming in and out sees these things there and they're reminded of them continually all right so that's just two or three verses out of Deuteronomy chapter six it's full of things like that and it's really uh really good Sound Advice it's almost like God knew that we'd be able to talk about that even thousands of years later we'd be able to pull that out and talk about it in church today it's amazing what God knows isn't it God is smart all right the unwelcome Christ brother random said people say but we got other things to do we can't go to church too many kids to get ready he said take him anyhow yeah can I say it that way take him anyhow yeah duh well the neighbors might say something well what do you care about the neighbors say use every opportunity say it with me use every opportunity I'm giving you tools to use I'm giving you uh keys to put in place here get to Jesus that's the main thing don't be took up with the Affairs of the world come on don't be taken up with the sports of the world and everything else we spend too much time on those things make your way to him and when you get there pour out your soul to him the brother man said don't let silly excuses keep you away from that use every opportunity use what God's given you I love this statement here mothers and fathers if you have children they must come first our success is a country and your success as a family depends not on what happens in the white house but what happens in your house you know who said that Barbara Bush in 1990. bless her heart now here's a statement that you probably never stopped and looked at but this is perseverance I think in 1964 brother Branham says Little David David the king he says no doubt raised in a lovely believing home his father Jesse was a great man of God dot dot dot I put the dot dot dot in there because I got a question for you is anybody here know anything that Jesse ever did that would cause us to call him great is there anything about Giants going down is there anything about armies being slaughtered with a Jawbone or is there any any kind of Explorer Supernatural event in Jesse's life that you know of I mean do you know anything about Jesse's Jesse at all except that he had a bunch of boys and one of them was tall and he was David's father I mean is there anything else that you know that would cause you to call him a great man of God that stopped me when I saw that all right why is brother Brandon calling him a great man of God it would be an interesting search for you to go and find uh type that in great man of God or man of God and find out who brother Branham identifies as a great man of God it would be of interest to you to do that but Jesse was one of these and he said he's a great man of God can I go ahead and finish the sentence because this is going to tell us what he did all right so that brother random called him a great man of God all right are you ready fathers you ought to tune in now watch this Jesse was a great man of God no doubt gathered all those boys around at night and had family prayer before they went to bed and probably read the Scrolls and talked about great Jehovah that had opened up the Red Sea and all those things and that created faith and Faith come by hearing and hearing the word of God and Little David got to thinking on that here's Jesse now considered by God a great man of God you know why because he gathers the Boys At Night takes the Scrolls out lays the scroll down and says who'd like to have a story before we go to bed yeah Dad we would yeah we would we would what do you want to hear tonight about Moses crossing the Red Sea or do you want to hear about Adam in the garden or what do you want to hear oh yeah tell us about Moses going across the Red Sea so Jesse probably got up there and said you know here's Moses standing here on the point and looking back and seeing the Egyptian Army looking and seeing the sea on this side mountains on this side and you know I don't know I I'd tell you how I did it I acted it out I mean if if there was a giant gonna fall down I got up on the bed and you know and fell down now I don't do that now because my boys are in their 30s so they're they're less entertained by that now but plus it's also takes a lot longer for me to get up and I fall down so uh you know you you change you adjust over time but in the early days I mean I got up there and added I I you know I got a rock and I uh I bought a sling one time and I was in Israel and I got a rock and I slung it around and uh told the stories to the boys and they were they were all kind of young wow wow did that really happen and this is what Jesse did he's he's called by Brother Branham a great man of God because he did that to create faith in the heart of David now watch now here's the next part of the the same quote here uh it says and he was responsible David was responsible for those sheep and one day a lion came in and got one he thought oh what am I going to do am I going to tell father about his sheep missing and he happened to remember that my father read the Scrolls and told me that now he's probably 12 13 14. he's not shaving yet right he's still a young guy are you with me but he's out there on the field and he said he smells this line sees this line and he says my father read from the Scrolls and told me that that God was a great deliverer to his people and he would bless Israel and he was with Israel and all that circumcised in that Covenant and God's blessing is upon them and I'm one of them wow and he said I have a right so I'm going after that sheep and he grabbed his slingshot and brought the Sheep back by killing the line he was perseverant what was God doing God was training him who did God use he used a great man of God called Jesse who just told him Bible stories at night Jesse was not a theologian as far as I know he wasn't a prophet as far as I know he didn't do anything else that we know except tell stories to his kids at night you know what I think it'd be a great thing for you to have a little devotional or do it in the morning or do it at night do in the afternoon whatever but your your children will benefit from like David did because David never knew he was going to be a King David never knew what was going to be the outcome of his life Jesse never knew what was going to be the outcome of his family he never knew any of that at all but but this is what brother Branham it takes time to point out that this is what happened in their household and Jesse just kind of was perseverant in telling these stories and it was a blessing amen you say did it matter did to David yeah are we all right yeah can I go a little farther all right so brother Branham says now again an influence he says no matter what the rest of the world has got to do he says that has not got one thing to do with you or me we are responsible to God for our lives and for our expectation with Christ now so would it be all right if I took a question and expounded on it for you like maybe Jesse would have for David would that be all right and this is something that every young person needs to know if you're if you're young now your fathers need to uh listen to this and you all you young people need to listen to this because this is one question or one issue that you need to have settled if you're going to have confidence in your Christian Life uh and that is about the sin question you got to know that you're forgiven we know that Jesus died on the cross how many would agree that Jesus died on the cross for your sins we you we all know that historically the Bible tells us that and your pastors repeated that but you got to know you got to know personally and the best way for you to know is get it direct from God's word and then we don't have any doubt about it right so I'm not going to turn this into a child service here but I want to just demonstrate to you how clear certain things are in terms of this particular question and there's lots of other questions as well that you can research for your family and talk about and it'll influence your your children as they grow up okay would that be all right this is going to be a little bit different here but you'll you'll see as We Roll Along here so I found this statement by Oswald Chambers and uh I thought it was worth repeating here at the beginning of Life we do not reconcile ourselves to the fact of sin most of us don't even believe that we're born in sin right when we when we first come into the world we take a rational view of life and say to the Man by controlling his instincts and by educating himself can produce a life which will slowly evolve into the life of God that's really true a lot of us feel like we can do this I mean when you're before you're really converted a lot of us feel we can do this Christian bookstore is full of uh how to's right uh you know all kinds of remedies for problems and solutions for things lots of people today who don't really know anything about the New Birth they'll go in there and they'll pick a book that helps answer the question about the problem that they have and they figure over time if I follow these principles you know what it'll slowly evolve into a life of God but you know what that's not how it happens right that's not how it happens right and and it doesn't happen because of this problem of sin that he's talking about and then he says but as we go on we find the presence of something which we have not taken into consideration sin and it upsets our calculations because you know what it's it's a fallen nature right yeah it's a fallen nature it's not the nature of God and so therefore sin has made the basis of things wild and not rational it is not being reconciled to the fact of sin that produces all the disasters of life it'll eventually eventually Take You Down and because we're born in sin every one of us have got to deal with this every one of us have got to face the question like the Rich Young Ruler uh he had done lots of good things lived in a good way all of his life but he was nagged by that one question what happens when I die what happens when I die where will I go will I have eternal life will I live forever and he he could not uh he could not reconcile that he could do lots of good things he could be obedient and he could be successful in business and all the rest of it but he couldn't reconcile that question he knew Jesus had something he needed amen and so it upset his calculations if you like and he you know he was not reconciled to this question of sin and so us I thought Oswald chamber said it very very nicely so we have to deal with this question and you've got to settle it in your hearts and I trust today it will be settled in your hearts forever that we are forgiven and if you're forgiven you know what you have communion with God and when you have communion with God God has access to you and you have access to God Amen you remember in the Old Testament nobody came near the Tabernacle nobody came near the holy of holies unless they had blood there had to be a provision made in order to come near the presence of God isn't that right amen and so God Made A Way God made a way for it to be even uh more perfect than that because now uh Jesus said I'll not only be with you but I'll be in you until the end of the way and and he made that way it wasn't us who did that but you've got to come to the place where uh you know it's all right for brother Barry to say it's so confidently it's all right for my pastor and brother Brandon to saith but you know what you got to come to a realization that this question has settled for me and settled once and for all because without it you'll always be wondering and without it you'll always be doubting and you're wondering well you know is this really true and am I really forgiven and all the rest of it and it'll it'll cause your Christian walk to be questionable even if it's in your own mind now God has never promised to meet any man brother Branham said upon his merits how good he or she is right right yeah I mean it's a good thing that you're good but God never promised to meet you because you are good there's no fellowship with God upon your own Merit there's no seniority with God there's no listen there's no entitlement with God well I've been in the message all my life I cut my teeth in the back of a message Pew and now you know what I've never even said the word Trinity in my life so God you owe me this you know and hey I that's a dangerous little attitude to have because that you know what that does that pushes the boundaries out a little bit farther in your own mind so well let's go on he said the only place that there is fellowship is under the shed blood from Genesis to Revelation it's through the blood an innocent substitute died in order to cover the guilty the penitent sinner only the blood that's that's the only way that God agreed to meet with That's the basis from the Garden of Eden onward God agreed to meet with uh individuals so the scripture says uh in Psalm 103 that he had not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities and all the forgiven said Thank You Jesus hey yeah you ought to be you ought to be reacting a little more than that I'm not I'm not rebuking you I'm just saying I'm awfully glad that God is Not has not dealt with me after my sins you don't know half my sins I'll tell you what I'm excited that God's not he's not dealing with me with me after after my iniquity and after my sin he does not deal with you on the basis of being good he doesn't deal with you on the basis of your iniquity glory to God he says for us Heaven is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy toward them that fear Him and as far as the East is from the West so far hathy removed our transgressions from amen I love it you ought to you ought to write these scriptures down like as a father pityth his children so the Lord pity at them that fear Him for he knows our frame and he remembers we are but dust he became one of us so he knows what it feels like he's been there done that got the scars to prove it let me tell you something we ought to we ought to rest in that verse alone that's a powerful verse and in Isaiah 53 the promise was he had to please the Lord to bruise him and he put him to grief why when thou shall make his soul an offering for sin it was not his sin but it was our sin that God made him an offering for are we clear on that Jesus lived he was sinless and he committed no sin uh he's the only one on earth who ever did that he was the only one that could lay down his life as a sinless offering here and he was made he was made an offering for sin and that sin is your sin you're the reason he had to go to the cross I tell people all the time candidates for baptism I tell them all the time that if Jesus never had to die for anyone he would have had to die for you you were the one that put him on the cross it wasn't just you but he would have had to go for you because you could not pay the penalty yourself and if you have eternal life God had to make a way for you to get into heaven and this is the way he did it he made Jesus Christ an offering for sin he made him a suffering savior on your behalf and it says he shall see his seed and prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand read down and he says and he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities God doesn't deal with you after your iniquity he took your iniquity and laid it upon him and he Bears your iniquity somebody say Amen hey that's good stuff in the Old Testament in the Old Testament the believer maybe committed adultery told a lie uh came with the lamb uh he's brother Ram said the first thing the lamb had to be perfect without a blemish for the sin offering and a lot of people think well if I could be a Christian if we'd just quit the if I just quit this and if I could just be a better person or a better woman I heard my father say that all of his life he was a smoker Drinker he was an alcoholic he was a Catholic and we would always witness to him you know we were young fellows wet behind the ears and we we witnessed everybody I mean we we told everybody about the gospel and we we try to convince a bunch of Jesuits one time and got in all kinds of trouble but we my father said this all the time he said well if I quit smoking he says then maybe I'll come into church and if I can quit drinking then I'll come into church and we always tried to tell him that uh if you could do it you wouldn't need the Holy Spirit right right yeah I I said you know surrender your life to Christ and watch what he does in your life I said because you know what he did in our lives because Dad used to tell people he said I remember uh you know when the message came and Outsiders and they were all Catholics all of our family were Catholics and we lived in the Catholic area and uh you know they'd ask him they say Frank what happened to your sons after all what what went on with them and dad knew dad knew what we were because he would come out Saturday night when we would be so drunk we'd fall on the ground and wouldn't be able to find the door so we couldn't get in the house and we'd be laying out on the on the lawn laying in a snowbank and dad would come out and pick us up and throw us in the bed and dad knew what kind of a life we lived and we were teenagers when when that went on and now dad looked around and saw his boys carrying their Bible who had got a haircut wow sitting Saturday night on the couch when we used to be out in the bar and now we're sitting on the couch having a Bible study or we're listening to brother Brandon on a tape and we'd be sitting there like this and Rewind it again we want to hear it again and he saw that difference in our lives and he knew and we said Dad if you could do it yourself you would need the holy spirit let let the Holy Spirit into your life and watch what he does in the cleansing power of the Holy Spirit and he always felt like he had to do that and brother random says you'd never be better in that estate in that way of thinking you'll never be better you can never get better until something comes in you to make you better and then you're born again you can't do it say it after me I can't do it I can't do it I never could still can't you can't do it something's got to come in and make you better something's got to be quick and inside you that makes you better something that's not to you has got to be at work in you to make you a real son or a daughter of God and let me tell you when you know it's not you doing it but it's some other higher power doing it you've got a piece that passes understanding and it comes with that amen now I'm a graphic person so let me draw it for you graphically no matter how good you are you could only rise as high as God's righteous requirements right sin doesn't enter into the presence of God and no matter how good we were we're still born in sin because of Romans 3 23 right right are you following me so no matter how good we were that's the height we could rise nothing else mattered nothing else would change that picture as it is written there's none righteous no not one say it after me not me not me none of us were none of us had the right to go up to God and say well how did I do I mean how about it amen don't tell me God doesn't have a sense of humor right he must really laugh at people who think that way there's none right just know not one and what brother Branham is telling us is that once the blood of Jesus Christ was shed you know what we could go right through that blood and keep going on and on and on into eternity and Revelation 5 9 is our is our testimony he sung a new song Thou Art Worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us unto God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and Nation the only way you can Ascend higher the only way you can pass through God's righteous requirement is that Jesus stood in your place and said I'll pay the price let them pass let them go and there's no stopping and Satan of God once he gets past that uh that blue line once he gets passed there through the blood of Jesus Christ there's no stopping no stopping them hey there's no stopping us when we die when we die it's not the end of our Lives we keep going we go right on it's not death that holds us it's not sin that holds us it's not the world that holds us nothing holds the Bride of Jesus Christ back we Ascend and we keep going all the way into eternity glory to God that's that's the picture now brother manham says again he says now we're imperfect and everybody I need you all to say Amen here we're imperfect you know he's talking to he's talking to you buddy born in sin shape didn't come to the world speaking lies we're no good to begin with but God don't look at you he looks at the sacrifice he looks at the lamb he don't see you because he sees Christ Jesus died for you and now if you can find some Fault With Jesus then your healing might not be right but if you don't find no fault with him it's perfect don't be afraid I'm an heir to this and I know I don't deserve it but I'm an anyhow you're sitting there saying I don't deserve it I say you're exactly right that's the truest thing you've said all day you don't deserve it you you did nothing in your life to deserve God saying now there's a there's a great guy there's a great girl right there God let me tell you you did not do anything that God would point at you and say I'm going to save that guy you know he's not in the book but I'm going to say anyway because he's such a great guy he just does so many things right forget it forget it here's the way Paul and brother Branham both wrote it this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners of whom I'm chief brother random said it in his way now as far as me myself as a man I am as you and worse than you that's what he said not me that's what he said I'm only saying what the tape say many of you all come with Christian backgrounds I'm the chiefest of Sinners the lowest of life that could be lived as an unbeliever and doubter I was but since a child have always known that there was a God and knew that there's something happened in my life and he said that's beyond any question at all brother Ram knew he had nothing to bring nothing in my hands I bring but simply to thy cross I cling and Paul had the same confession here because just because they're prophets and just because they're used of God and just because they say they'll say the Lord doesn't mean somehow that they have some exemption here they were Sinners just like us they came through the same blood that we came through they came through the same Act of repentance that we did had to received the same holy ghost that we have exactly the same and in every way the requirement of a new birth was the same for them as for us because we're all all there's no none righteous no not one [Music] and God made this possible but they're quick to acknowledge and they're quick to identify their own sinfulness and their own sinful past and Paul says you know the scripture here and I'm just going going quickly because you know the scripture he says but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ and he says I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and to count them a dung that I may win Christ let me paraphrase just a little bit and say that the one word that helps us understand this verse is that Paul is acknowledging that compared to what I have now that he said is not even worth anything I thank God for you know heaven heaven brought me to where I am but compared to what I have now I'd never go back to that that's behind me I'd never go back to that absolutely not because now I know what I have now now he says I can be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through Christ Jesus the righteousness which is of god by faith and that I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead everything the power to take me from the grave is now in me and the power to uh you know to to live for God is now in me it's not not me that lives but Christ that lives in me the power to forgive is now in me the power the power the anointing to love the anointing to teach the anointing to know the anointing to be a Son of God the anointing to face death and still preach that's all in me now and he said compared to what I had this is nothing he said I press on now towards the mark I was this but now I'm this and compared to this I mean nothing compares to this it's behind me wow wow and that's where the dung phrase comes in and he says I I you know he freely is telling his testimony about uh where he's come to I I love this and brother bam says now when I'm praying when I'm praying God don't see me he just hears my voice through the blood of Jesus Christ think about this now next time you get down to pray when you're praying God doesn't see you but when you speak to him he hears your voice through the blood of Jesus Christ he don't see me he hears my voice and that blood there is to represent what I ask then he hears my voice but he sees only the blood he don't see me so I can't be dirty when I'm under the blood the blood cleanses [Music] he don't see me I can't be dirty when I'm under the blood you go through a week in this world on your job dealing with people out there and you know listening to the language and seeing what's going on on the internet and you're just you know you're just plowing through life and going through the week and I mean if you're in a college how many of you people are in college any kind of college or high school I got any high schoolers any college you don't believe in education here anyone at all in the school any anybody know how to spell the word school all right here we go here we go God bless you young man uh I mean you you go through school and you got to listen to what your cohorts tell you and they're trying to pull you to do this and making fun of you because they don't and uh you know they they make fun of girls and all the rest of it and and you know the the stuff that goes on in schools and the stuff that goes on in universities and the stuff that goes on in your job uh you know one of my sons worked at a bank and he said it wasn't like a week before he got there and all of a sudden they're talking about the next rainbow event and they want them to wear a rainbow tie we want you to wear a rainbow tie to work you know I'm just working in a bank here I'm I'm not in public and I but you know if you don't if you don't wear the rainbow tie you know what everyone will be offended they'll be offended you know because you're you're being discriminatory and it doesn't matter about your rights it matters about their rights your rights don't really count don't talk about your rights here because you're a Christian and they don't have rights so don't worry about that and and everywhere you go you rub shoulders with dirt and nonsense and filth and everything else and you can come to church here this morning dress nice but you may feel in your spirit you're dirty because you've mixed with a dirty world all week you I mean you may have not done anything wrong you may not cross any lines but you feel like uh you feel like uh you know you just feel like uh mop water at the end of a week because you've just been around it so much and listen to the language and listen to the old humor and all this all the other stuff that goes on there and and you can feel that way you may not be but you can feel that way and sometimes that can be even defeating in your own mind because you feel like man I probably shouldn't even go to church or I probably shouldn't even take foot washing and communion you know what because I mean I just you know I just feel like man just such a rascal out there in the in the world it may not have done anything but you feel that way right amen and then sometimes you wonder well what's the point and but let me tell you something I'm here to tell you this morning the good news is is that he don't see me when I pray and I can't be dirty when I'm under the blood because when he looks at me he only sees the blood Hallelujah and you need to stop looking at you like you look at you you need to be looking at yourself like God looks at you and I'm telling you this morning exactly how God sees you and that is he doesn't see you he sees the blood and if he sees the blood of his own son you know what I'll go to church I'll go to church I'm going to put my trust in this hello that's what you're supposed to do [Applause] I didn't come all the way down here to tell you stories I try to keep false Doctrine to a minimum when I travel huh I mean it's either true or it's not amen there's nothing in between this right he doesn't have seal there's nothing in between here this is either true or it's not true I believe it's true do you believe it's true if that's true the sin question is settled you know what it's all under the blood [Applause] can I go a little further today God's made a contact contract not because you were good because you joined Church you could be ever so good and live a clean life I'm being repetitive here and give part of your money uh give up all the sins of the world like lent and uh to live just as true and faithful as you can he said you'll miss Heaven just as far as East is from the West if you're if you're trying to approach the Gates of Heaven on the basis of this forget it it isn't by goodness that we are saved but it's by his Mercy say it with me his Mercy now I'll say it all together now his Mercy most congregations are not good at this but it's by my congregation I got to go three times every time I got to go three rounds before they get it right it takes up a lot of time but it's by his Mercy that we're bought it's by his Mercy that we're bought he paid the price you remember back in the Old Testament when I think it was Jeremiah wanted to buy the field and the man said hey inhabit he said no I want to buy it I want to make sure that there's an exchange here yeah yeah I want to make sure there's something given for this and I I'm not going to take it for free I thank you but I'm not going to take it for free because uh you may not understand it but this is a type of what God's going to do later on he's going to pay a price for people here and he just doesn't want it for free and give them to him here because then Satan would always have an advantage so if you don't mind I'm going to pay the price and I'm going to pay the full price I'm going to pay everything so nobody can come back and say you didn't pay Jesus did pay [Applause] and it isn't by goodness I would say but it's by his Mercy that we're bought and God that God wanted to make Sons and Daughters of God Hallelujah like brother Jason said last night that brother Lonnie said that God never wanted to have a family he became a family but that family was still lost in sin so we had to settle a sin question in order for them to come back in fellowship with god with Father God when Jesus was here on Earth he made a sacrifice for healing and salvation Jesus could not come tonight and save you he's already done it right a sin question was settled [Music] same question was settle where Calvary how long was it settled forever would you agree the sin question is settled in the eyes of God the sin question would you agree it's settled in God's mind this is not a question it's not not a doubt and God's not wondering it's settled price for sin has been paid he is the Lamb of God that took away the sins of the world it's past tense when a prophet tells you it's past tense Let it go Let it go I say this if it's good enough for God good enough for me I'm not going to argue that if God accepts that's fine great no matter how much you would scream out it wouldn't do you a bit of good he's a high priest sitting at the right hand of the Majesty of God he said you've got to accept it and profess it amen you've got to accept it and profess it same way for healing same way anything God provides for you you've got to accept it you might sit there and say well you know I believe brother Brandon had it I believe brother Barry's got it he's all red in the face I believe he's got it I believe Jason's got it here he's making notes that really is not going to do you any good until you sit there and say you know what I believe that you young people got to sit there and embrace this as truth and say you know what even if everyone walked out of here and said brother Barry's a false teacher I still believe it it's got to be that clear it's got to be that solid for you and then and only then this is incredible sin question settled for you it's already settled for God it's got to be settled for you oh listen all I'm doing is being a Jesse all right and all I'm doing is just giving you a Bible story before we quit all right I got this question from somebody and this was a sister and uh she she was actually uh well you'll read the the question and figure it out but she's not sure all right the question was two screens long stay with me so when I came to the message she said people told me that the Holy Ghost was not in me before the message that it was just an anointing and that anointing can be even on and bless unbelievers because the rain falls on the just in the unjust so here she is now she comes in on a message and everybody says well it all begins right there and you were not saved or you're not under the blood before the message or that I wasn't even covered by the blood of Jesus Christ during those years and it really makes you wonder how to know when your peace is true peace and how to know when your salvation experience is real and how to know when you're truly following God this is a great question that's the first part here's the second part because from that moment in 1986 I had peace that passes understanding when she came in contact with God she said I had peace that passes understanding I had joy unspeakable and full of Glory I knew I had a relationship with the Creator I knew thank you I knew that I had a relationship with the Creator I it would be like finding out right now that there was yet another prophet and you really weren't under the word for your day and all this time you weren't covered by the blood yet you have had all the right relationships and experience and life that the Bible speaks about so here's the question so were my past experiences true experiences with God good question yes yes you'd have to agree that was a good question amen and I I I I communicated with this person and I I wanted to let brother Branham answer her okay and I I because I found some statements that uh would really help her okay and so follow me now I'm going to answer her question all right so it's not going to take a long time but watch what watch what brother Brandon says in 1957 and I gave her a bunch of scriptures and uh you know gave her some commentary and so forth but what's really what's really valuable for us to be able to give to somebody is not what I think right yeah right right that's that's all right but that's really not as good as When God says because in God's mind this is already a subtle thing right and and so therefore let God tell her let God convince her so I gave her the word and and I prayed with her that the Holy Spirit would convince her of how God views this whole question that she's asked which is a great question and brother Brown says by one Spirit we're all baptized into the body he said that isn't when the new birth begins the new birth begins when you believe on the Lord Jesus foreign that's right now notice what he doesn't say I hope this is all right good but he said the new birth begins when you walk in a message Church he doesn't say that amen amen the new birth doesn't begin when you come in contact with self-righteous message believers who believe it's just us for no more and you have to come to Bethel Tabernacle or you're not really in a message um God forbid we have that attitude God forbid yeah now listen he says what can you do besides believe in other words can I mean would bleeding help would shouting help we've already proved it wouldn't would giving your body to be burned would that help no I mean if I understand it right based on what I've already told you the work's already been done yeah yeah right if Jesus stood here tonight he couldn't forgive you because he's already done it now listen what can you do besides believe what more can you do now let me stop again and say it's not just an intellectual exercise where you just say uh do I believe yes or no check one box and don't check both right it's not an intellectual exercise you know what it is it really is a an encounter with God an encounter with the Living God and that's not a passive thing that's a real thing you should be able to tell your testimony it might not be dramatic it might not be you know lightning and thunder going off but I will tell you something when a person meets God they know they've met God they know they've met God what can you do about it any more than just believe it he said tell me one thing that you could do there's not one thing that you can do outside of believe it God's already settled the the in other words there's nothing in your your power that can make you more saved than what Jesus has already done you can't be more forgiven than what God's already forgiven you you can't be more more righteous than what God's already made you he's already made you accepted in the Beloved you know what and you can't make yourself more acceptable then God can make you acceptable amen does that make sense and that that's what he's saying here so don't try to improve on God just let God's word be true and accept that and believe that that's what he's trying to get her to understand now then brother man tells a story about the car salesman you remember that and and it's a hot day it's back in the 50s or so and uh this car salesman he's got a jacket and a really fancy tie and he go he puts on the jacket because it there's a couple of women that are out there I put on my coat to go out and some ladies were out there and on the road back I hung up my coat when I did I said I wonder if I gave them the keys and I reached in my pocket and I pulled out a little piece of paper and had written on it where will you spend eternity and he didn't know where that came from he's looking for keys and he finds this little piece of paper will you spend eternity and he said I laid it down and I said turn the fans on and I picked it back up again and he said I couldn't get away from it where will you spend eternity he's not in church uh he doesn't know anything about brother Branham he he's he's just all of a sudden he's encountered a question that he doesn't have an answer for I got to reckon with this I got to deal with this this question here and then he tells the story uh pause for a second don't read that uh look he says this is my sermon here so you he said in his story he said I went to the uh Methodist people and they told me oh no problem you got to come to the Altar and you got to pray and be Sanctified and he said I did that and I didn't answer the question and he said then I went to the Pentecostals and they said you got to speak in tongues and I did and he said it still didn't answer the question he said then I got a I went to a Billy Graham meeting he said I went to a meeting with Oral Roberts and Oral Roberts did this and so forth and he said at the end of it he said I was still kind of questioning and wondering well you know where will I spend eternity you didn't have an answer brother Branham talks to him and says and he and and the the this this part is when he's telling brother Branham because he met somebody and somebody said you need to go down and talk to Bill Branham down here down the road and he finds a brother Brandon he talks to him he says you don't need a prophet to straighten you out you just need the word of God yes now remember now I'm answering the question that this girl asked me okay and she's wondering is she really saved when was she saved and so forth and brother Branham says now what the Pentecostals and yet he said what's Pentecostals and the nazarenes and so forth what Mr Graham told you is truth the nazarenes what the Pentecostals and yet it's not the truth he said to shout raise your hand speak with tongues is not receiving Christ receiving Christ is receiving the person of the Lord Jesus Christ it's a meeting with God it's a new birth right he said then these other things take place after that yeah yeah now could you do all those things still didn't have Christ yet and and so he's saying that you know there's a there's a beginning there's a meeting with God and he said there's an encounter that you have and he said all these other things take place they're not wrong they're not wrong but speaking in tongues doesn't save you right right right if if it did my goodness and every Pentecostal would be saved right well brother Branham where can I find him I said I want to ask you something let's go back to your story that day when you came in and picked up that piece of paper and something struck you and said I want to see God up to that time you were going this way or down the road and then you turned this way what did it well that's what repentance is isn't it repentance is you're going this way in life and now you do a 180 and you're going this way in life you know in other words he's already fulfilling scripture and doesn't even realize it he's actually walking in the word and obeying the word and doesn't even realize it because people have diverted him into believing well I got to do this I got to be here I got to speak in tongues all the other things that are there and brother man I'm saying now all of a sudden he said you're going this way now you're going that way and he says what changed your opinion what came into your heart that made you one time not care for God and something came in now to make you go to loving God right and he said well I don't know and I said before there could be a creation there's got to be a Creator he said God came into your heart right there when you looked at that piece of paper I'm only saying what the tape say yeah he said you mean I've had it all along and I said certainly brother and he jumped up he began to scream and cry that was settled for him you know why because he's got the word on it now and he said well do you want to pray for me and I said what's the use of praying for you you don't need any prayer the truth has set you free good answer brother random good answer haha amen God knows exactly what he's doing God knows how to reach the elect God knew how to find you God knew how to attract you God knew how to divert you and and he put the right thing in your pocket he put the right person in front of you he let you hear the right sermon or whatever whether you're raising a message or whether you come from the gutters of sin let me tell you God knew exactly how to knock on your door and get your attention so that you could not leave that until that question was settled and God has a variety of ways of doing it I thank God for the word that tells us this is already settled in the eyes of God let it be settled in our hearts now that he has forgiven us yeah and if we walk in the light as he's in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen glory to God he died Jesus died that he might breed back Hallelujah only the blood can do that only through the chemistry of the blood of Jesus Christ can bring back again a person that won't vary one word from what God Said how do I know I got it I got it because I I there's something in me that just can't vary from the word of God he said but I can't forgive well just give it enough time let God work on you you can't force Somebody to Love and can somebody Force somebody to respect and you can't force somebody to forgive right that's got to come from within right got to come from the heart you can't force your children to obey they might comply but you you can't force them to love and Jesus said this he said if you love me you'd keep my Commandments [Music] so this is not dictated let me tell you the bride of Christ we don't we don't operate by legislation we operate by revelation and I got a revelation that I'm set free I got a revelation that what I what I was I'm not now by the grace of God and that was not that was not possible I mean I in my own testimony and if you've ever heard it the story Bound for Glory and uh I was uh I have I have what they refer to as an addictive personality and just my way and as my father had it and I have it and uh uh it's a funny thing but I when I was in the world and I was uh out there a young fella I started smoking when I was 11. and uh it just it just kind of hooked in there caught me and uh I for a while I'd give it up because it didn't feel good it made me feel bad and I was a lifeguard I was a swimmer and if you're a swimmer and you're trying to hold your breath underwater smoking's not a good thing ain't a good thing at all and uh because it shrinks the elasticity in your lungs and so forth and all the other stuff so I tried to give it up and I give it up and I found out I couldn't give it up I'd steal cigarettes from my father uh my father called me a low down dirty rat one time because I stole these cigarettes and I I would I would take cigarette butts that I'd find on the street and straighten them out and clean them up a little bit and smoke them I I collect them and I I I couldn't give them up it had a power over me I mean I was it was something that was I realized after a while was was stronger than me and uh when I uh when God got a hold of my heart I was still smoking when when God got a hold of my heart first time and I went and got baptized when I had my experience with God and when got baptized and it was middle of winter so I had my big parka on and I I came back from the town where I went to to get baptized and I was now just you know you just have a different walk in have a different song you have a different story you know after your yes surrender your life to Christ and I was walking down to downtown Street you know one of them I'm one of them so we only knew a couple of songs because we were Catholics you know and we we only knew Amazing Grace because we heard Willie Nelson sing it so you know we didn't really know a whole lot but I was thinking one of them going down the street and when I uh when I was going down so cold I put my hands in the pocket of my parka and bang I felt something I knew exactly what that was a box of cigarettes and immediately immediately I was so ashamed that I still carried cigarettes and I I just looked around to see if anybody I knew was around and there was nobody around so I just went like this and I went over found the nearest garbage can just threw them in the garbage can and went on and got rid of them because I was so ashamed that I was actually carrying them in my pocket after I was you know baptized and saved and and I I was just I was just so struck by that and then afterwards this struck me that I didn't take that away from me I didn't I didn't quit he took the desire out of that for me and I didn't have to try at all I didn't have to put any effort into it at all he took that desire from me and now I could be in a room waist high full of cigarettes wouldn't wouldn't affect me because I have no desire for it it's gone it's completely gone and he who in the sun sets free is free indeed and I believe I believe it was one of those little incidents that God allowed me to experience to prove this is not about you but this is me in you and the only way you're over going to come is me and you not you you're I'm not going to give you the tools and you go do it it's going to be me and you expressing The Life of Christ it's going to be me and you overcoming it's going to be me and you loving the unlovable it's me and you forgiving those people that you don't want to forgive it's not going to be you it's not going to be Berry coffee holding out his chest because if it was then you'd have a right to go up to heaven and say well how about now but when we go in there we'll all sing the same song of Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me I I once was lost but now I'm saved only the blood of Christ can breed a person back to a position where they don't vary from the word of God oh my goodness I tell you what I just love it here I we we could we could go on and there's all kinds of things here that we could include uh and and I I just you you have that you're going to have the PowerPoint so you can have it all if you're a fast reader you're good hey brother now watch watch this he said I I'd invite each one of you he said to come here at the altar and kneel down say Lord Jesus be merciful I want you to come into my heart he said God bless you brother and he said this man's name is Davis and he comes from Virginia and he's up here to give up a habit of smoking and a little Grudge that he's held in his heart against a loved one since he was a child and that's what he's at the altar for this morning God cares about the little things he's got a problem with smoking and he's got this little Grudge that he's alone to hear just enough to keep the Holy Spirit at Bay and you know what he's got to let go of that he's just got to let go and say Lord I'm going to forgive that person and I gotta Just Surrender it to you and here's God here's God through a prophet God's busy he's got he's got worlds to run he's got you know everything to to operate in the world here and and yet he's he's dealing with a prophet on this platform and this you know this man from Virginia is just kneeling at the altar and he's taking the time to tell this little Grudge matters and this little problem with smoking that he has it matters and you know what there's something in here for this guy to do he's just got to let that go and and what he can't accomplish in life you watch How I take that over and I'll deal with that but he's come to the right place and he's come to the altar in order to give that to God and sometimes that's just what you got to do yeah you gotta say Lord I can't deal with this anymore I can't overcome this myself I got to give it to somebody and that's all he wants you to say it's all he wants you to do because he had he always has a remedy he always has a solution let me tell you to me I hope if nothing else I've proven to you this morning that the sin question is settled in the eyes of God Amen that's that's a done deal I hope for you as an individual young or old that you realize the sin question also should be settled for you and if you can if you can understand if you can have a revelation of that fact that the sin question is settled and what I did my sinfulness is gone it's buried in the sea of God's forgetfulness and you know what you can have confidence as you leave here and whatever mistake I make I can bring to God and repent true repentance amen amen give it to him and I believe that the blood of Jesus Christ still atones today the same as it ever did I believe it's still as powerful today as it ever was but you know what no one's going to come and and uh impose that upon you you like brother van says you have to believe what God's provided you had to believe what God's given right now all I've been to you this morning is the father I wanted to be like Jesse just to take a subject work it through and and to me to me in raising our boys one of the things that I I felt like they needed to really have down pat was this whole idea of forgiveness and in the Sin question whether it's predestination or whether it's sanctification or whether it's you know do I need to go to church or like this sister asked her when was I saved there's lots and lots of more information that brother Brandon gives to people when they ask that question when am I saved and uh there's there's lots of things there let me tell you I think the on the front lines of the battle that we fight today in terms of families and marriage and relationships and all of that the the people who are on the front line are fathers I said I think the people on the front lines are men men of God and I believe you've got to have an attitude of rejecting passivity and take responsibility and and uh you know just stand stand solid and what you know and remember what we said in Deuteronomy it's got to be in thine heart then teach your children be prepared to teach it diligently but you have to teach it to your children once it's in your heart so the question has to be settled for you and then you can help settle it for somebody else and to me that's what fathers do that's that's the fatherhood of God it's father father God who made a a way for us to to be able to pass through that blue line right it's father God who did that and he knew we needed a savior he knew we needed an offering for sin and he made a way for that God sees ahead God knows what what we have need of and I I believe the same way that you as natural fathers you've got a bit of that in you where you're looking at your kids and saying you know what we gotta we gotta talk about some things we gotta deal with some things we gotta we gotta plan we gotta sit down we gotta look look a little bit up the road here hey this might be over tomorrow right it might all end tomorrow we don't know that but I want to be found in my posted duty until that time comes amen so let me be the best father I can be let me be the best man of God that I can be because it doesn't matter what anybody else in the world does it's between me and God and so fathers you need to step up to that plate if you have not and I I don't mean to make you feel bad I'm just saying that everything in the description everything in the message here says that you know there's there's so many things God has given us to use well let's use them let's do it because your father nobody else can take your place your grandfather nobody else can take your place and God gave you those children God gave you those offspring to minister to they're in your little sphere of influence they're in your little church you know what you're you have a responsibility you have a role to play I wonder what all you fathers just stand to your feet for a moment I'd like to pray with you if you're father grandfather husband I'd just like to have a word of prayer with you but Jason this is all right and and uh you you folks that are there I wonder could we have sister bank would you like to come up and and uh just give us a little music here and what I what I just want to pray for these brothers here for a moment and all you that are still sitting uh in some way or another you probably have a connection to somebody who's standing and or maybe your husband's not here for some reason or another or father but uh I want you just to be praying for them as well and say uh I can't be the father otherwise I'd be standing I can't be the man of the house here so I'm praying that God will help him find his place and give him the courage to lead and give him the vision he needs for our family and give him uh you know the the the willingness to ask forgiveness and give him what he needs Lord to lead our little family you pray all the time probably for your pastor and say Lord give him what we have need of help him delete us as you look at him look kind of like a father I know some of you had bad fathers and the the experience and the memories are not good I know that but you know With God all things are possible God can help refresh that God can help gives give you a an understanding above that [Music] let's pray father we thank you Lord for these men of God that standing here today Lord and I I know in every every Church whatever we do to strengthen families we strengthen the church because the church is really just a group of families and when we come together we're called a family of God and one day we'll all be gathered together from all ages in one place and we'll be called a family of God and it'll all go back to the way it was supposed to be but Lord I realize these men face unique challenges today that probably no other age ever faced and have to deal with not only rampant immorality but technology that doesn't quit governments that don't cooperate [Music] Financial pressures that don't seem to go away and questions that keep coming I pray Lord you put answers in their mouth pray dear God you'd give them the courage to forgive I pray Lord Jesus that you would give him the strength to carry on and may they firmly stand on the front line of the battle for their family and I ask oh God that you would Empower them and anoint them to do what is right in your eyes and Lord may they all be like Jesse at the end of the day May they be remembered like we remembered Jesse now a great man of God maybe didn't bring down walls of Jericho and maybe didn't slay Giants but he did a great thing [Music] I pray Lord you would bless these men guide them in your perfect will stop them prevent them Lord from going astray and some other some other notion or idea that isn't your will but may they esteem your word above their necessary meat and Lord let their children see them pray [Music] we'll commit them to you now in confidence in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord we pray [Music] Lord be glorified let's all stand be glorified in my life Lord be glorified today in my home Lord [Music] be glorified be glorified in my life Lord be glorified today in this church [Music] in this church Lord Lord be glorified be glorified oh Lord be glorified in my life why don't we raise our hands and sing it to Jesus the Lord be glorified responsibility foreign he my life oh Lord be glorified day you know why I was thinking about that statement and you know the brother Branham says here Jesus died that he might breed back that is an astonishing statement I think it it took a profit to put it to that level Jesus died that he might breed back and brother Branham says the same way I feel about that oh Hallelujah only the blood can do that only the blood can do that only through the chemistry of the blood of Jesus Christ can breed back again a person that won't vary one word from what God said that that that's quite a lot you know and I was thinking I was appreciating all of the husbands and fathers and grandfathers who stood but you know I I want to say you know to the sisters married and single you know to the married sisters pray for your husband to stand in that position you sisters who aren't married yet trust me that's the kind of husband you're going to want to have don't have anything to do with a man unless you can see him look just like that unless that has happened in his life don't have nothing to do with it amen that that'd be the best advice I could give single sisters you make sure you find a man that has came through the blood of the who's been bred back to be the kind of person that will vary one word because I can tell you when you start facing life you're going to want somebody that won't vary one word not even one word I have come all over these years to sow trust in the word of God you know I when somebody comes to me and I appreciate it brother berries approach to that here he gets that fantastic question and you know what he he made a decision his mind immediately went to well let me give her what the word says I have found not only have I always found victory in that I've only found Victory all the time in that and somebody comes to me with a question my mind immediately starts thinking okay what word applies this because I know there's a word that applies to whatever you can face and I'm here to tell you something friends when you when you give somebody the word I just did that recently had a young sister come to me for some career advice and I just gave her the word and I said look here's what the word now don't don't forget [Music] and within within a day I'm already getting a testimony back it's exactly I took your advice exactly and here's what happened and it all came out good amen and and that that that is so thrilling to minister of the Gospel who spends his life who has dedicated his life to the service of God's family by ministering the word of God and there is nothing of such prevailing power as a revelation of God's word you can I I literally can say to you young men young sisters old married single there you can you can Bank your soul you can bet your life on the word of God you can absolutely disregard anything and just say I'll put my whole life on every word of God I promise you you'll come out good oh the word of God is the only thing Satan is completely powerless to deal with when you believe the word of God he has no remedy for that not wonderful when you believe the word of God Satan has nothing he can do because he cannot defeat the word of God I appreciate it today and this whole weekend and today especially for the balanced Direct Simplicity of the word of God that literally puts puts to silence all gainsayers all naysayers people who talk about this and talk about that and you know the unfairness of this or you all believe that or it's all about this and you're all just don't call you know forget it forget it God made it so simple and Christ did all the work and offers it to you for free I remember years ago brother Lee blue our great friend and he said you know if somebody could if somebody could bring you uh like a pill or a vitamin and he said and all you had to do was take that and it would give you eternal life it would turn you back to Eternal youth it would give you an eternal world it would give you joy unspeakable you would never have a sorrow again he said what would the value how much would you be willing to pay he said every human in the in the world would empty their bank account to buy that and he said well I got a pill that won't cost you a dime that won't cost you a dime it's totally free it's the gospel amen I so appreciated that today brother Barry I appreciate you humbling to the leadership of the Holy Spirit have you been enriched today friends wash clean by the washing of the water let that just put aside all doubt today if anybody asks you what it takes to stand pleasing in the presence of God now you know you know the answer to the greatest question that mankind faces question mankind has sought for millennia how do I get eternal life well today explorers and kings and Monarch and they sent expeditions and they sent armies and they tried to do everything to find the answer that you got to sit here today and heard for free and there's no question about it it's sure it's signed sealed and delivered to you today are you happy in that amen there's nothing that can breed you back but the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and that will work 100 of the time amen praise the Lord amen let's sing and worship him now ready here I am way come fill my heart you are the only one who can feel me here I am waiting come fill my heart [Music] Lord I am ready here I am waiting come which [Music] you are the only

having for our homeschool vision and cottage School vision we don't expect we can do everything at once or learn everything at once this but this is going to be the inaugural time when we pitch a vision to you so I'm I'm asking personally that that the parents whether you are homeschooling or not if you've even thought about it or even if you haven't come and hear the presentation because I'm I feel personally very burdened to go in this direction I want to see what the Lord can do for us brother Barry and sister Becky have a presentation they're going to give and then there's going to be some time because I I said I know some of these homeschool moms are going to have questions based on the presentation based on the ideas of their own and so we're going to have a part of it that's more of a monologue and then we're going to have a part that is more of a dialogue so it starts at four o'clock and we want to invite anyone raising children to come to it amen it'll be a personal favor to me if you can make that happen now I want to just remind also there was an announcement we sent out on behalf of Brother Brad and Sister Sarah there's an event at their home I think that's going to start up around six so that should probably be if we start that session for somewhere okay amen I'm not trying to put him in a Corral but I mean we're trying to get to events here at once
