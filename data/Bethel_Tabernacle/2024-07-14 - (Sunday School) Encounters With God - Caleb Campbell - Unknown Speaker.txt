help our hearts just come to your altar clean father ready to be Lord filled Lord with your spirit father forgive us and just walk with us today Lord God let you have preeminence in all things we worship you and we praise you we love you and we ask it in Jesus name this morning amen amen let's turn into the Bible we're going to start at St John chapter 14 and then we're going to go to Genesis after that Genesis 32 so St John 14 and we're going to just read two verses St John 14 16 and 17 and it says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen and then let's turn over into the Book of Genesis the 32nd chapter Genesis 32 we're going to read a good portion of this chapter this morning Genesis 32 we'll start at verse one and it says and Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him and when the Angels saw him he called the name of that place mahanahan and Jacob sent Messengers before him to Esau his brother under the land of sear the country of Edom and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto unto my Lord Esau thy servant Jacob saith thus I have sojourned with laben and stayed there until now and I have oxen and ax asses and flocks and Men servants and women servants and I have sent to tell my Lord that I may find Grace in thy sight and The Messengers returned to Jacob saying we came to thy brother Esau and also he cometh to meet thee and 400 men with him then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two bands and said if Esau come to one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape and Jacob said oh god of My Father Abraham and God of my father Isaac the Lord which saith unto me return unto thy country and to thy Kindred and I will deal well with thee I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies and of all thy truth which thou has showed unto thy servant for with my staff I passed over this Jordan and now I am become two bands deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the he from the hand of Esau for I fear Him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children and thou said I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for the multitude and down we're going to skip some verses go down to verse 22 and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two women servants and his 11 sons and passed over the for Jabbok and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent all that he had and Jacob was left alone Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the waking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breth and he said I will not let thee go except thou blessed me and he bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with man and Hast prevailed and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou do ask after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of that place pineal for I have seen God face to face and my life is pre preserved and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh therefore the children of Israel eat not of the senu which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh under this day because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the senu that shrink God bless you as you take your seats this morning sorry that was a lengthy reading but this example in Jacob's life has really been dealing with me lately just these past several days how many times in our life does God have to wrestle with us in things Amen to bend us from and Shake us from our will in certain situations amen you know and when you go read this circumstance in Jacob's life the win that from that wrestling match was it signifying that he somehow overpowered the angel of the Lord cuz when you you know when you wrestle God the only way to win is in complete submission amen so God God wasn't looking for him to prove his strength he wasn't looking for Jacob to prove his physical strength amen and you know when you read at the beginning of that chapter even earlier in his life you know God had encounters or Jacob had encounters with God and with angels amen the title for this morning his encounters with God but none of those encounters that he had was able to shake Jacob enough to rid him of that old nature to change his name to change the way that he walked until one day God let him into a position and he backed Jacob into this corner you know God wasn't just going to hand it over to him on a silver platter amen he he wanted to make sure this time that Jacob was willing to truly surrender you know I believe that God knows all things amen we all believe that this morning and he knew that Jacob was terrified of the future you know he he was meeting his brother Esau and and he had just left one moment of fear if you go read and and he had just left laan and and left I think in the middle of the night and took his flocks and then laan ended up catching up with him and so he find one situation where he was running and right now now he's in another situation so he had one critical juncture to another amen and he ran into this situ ation with his brother who you know 20 something years earlier Jacob had deceived and then he ran from because he was afraid that Esau was was going to kill him you know but God always has the right timing in our life amen and it was at this time in Jacob's life that God could finally appear to him and make known unto him the promise that was always ordained for his life you know Jacob was always ordained to life he was always Isaac's son he was always a son of ab Abraham God always had plans for his life but you watch in his life how some how that old nature kept bleeding through into his decisions and into into the way that he walked into the into the things that he did and how that fear was the thing that that drove him in so many things until he came to pineal and came face to face with God as the scripture says you know God is always trying to show you and I who we are really supposed to be you know he said sends he sends his word you know when when Pastor give delivers the sermon you know he sends some of us parents that that train us the word of God and and show you what it means to be a believer and show you train you in the way that you should go you know and he sends bits of inspiration throughout your life you know if you go back and you read about Jacob you know just a few chapters earlier he had come to that experience at bethl where he saw the angels of he had encounter with God he had encounters with angels and he had that vision and and at that point God had actually told him the truth about his lineage and when he came to this this point in this chapter he had actually reminded him God Jacob was reminding God of that of that of that promise but that experience at Pinel wasn't until four chapters later a place where finally Jacob was ready for a total submission a full submission he wasn't willing to leave that place until God blessed him amen he wasn't willing to let go of the presence of that angel until he knew without a shadow of doubt that he had received something from it amen he had received something f it so it's not until you come to a critical place in your life you know you could you could accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior but have you come into a place in your life where you haven't had just had an encounter with God but you've had this kind of an encounter with God where you can say that I've set face to face and now it's changed the way that I walk it's changed my name it's changed my nature amen even um you know he was always meant to be that patriarch but so many of his decisions reflected that old nature you know and when you go read uh the book of Hosea it even says that from his very birth that he was that he was grabbing the heel of Esau you know it was inherent in his very nature to be that way but once he came face to face with God something really changed amen something changed the way that he walked amen you know and when when that old nature that we're all born with is still in control of your life it bleeds through into your actions it bleeds through in the way that you think it bleeds through in the way that you live amen it it's still in your character you know you know the prophet of God is two specific places if you go and listen to these sermons two specific places but he says it several times says the evidence of the Holy Ghost is saying Amen to every word Feast of trumpets and church the church age book were two places he makes that so clear but with your life amen it's displayed in your actions not just by letter or word I believe you say I believe okay well now put put take the letter from the speech and make it a living reality that's what is the identification amen cuz he changes the way that you live from the inside out not a manufactured thing amen um you know much of the world this has just been really heavy on my heart especially last two days much of the world I believe is deceiving themselves to say that you believe in Jesus amen because to truly believe in something it's evident in the way that you live it's evident in the actions you take it's evident in the speech you use it's evident in every aspect of your life so to say that I believe something but then the actions of your life aren't measuring up with what you believe then you don't truly believe that thing you say I believe the message of the hour well if your life isn't measured up to everything God says in that message then you don't believe it amen I believe a key a key difference is that once you have what John 14 describes as the spirit of truth dwelling within you it's no longer you trying to fit God into some box in your life amen into a category like he's some material possession that you carry around with you like just for an example you you kick your keys with you right or you take your phone with you but then when you go somewhere and you leave that thing in the car then it's really not with you it's more of a it's more of a possession and I believe that that sometimes is what Jesus is to a lot of people because it's just it's just a possession you take him with you sometimes but then sometimes you leave them in the car or sometimes you leave him at home amen it's important to know that it is not a material possession to have a relationship with Jesus it is an actual Fellowship that you have he lives within you he indwells inside of you amen it is something that you take with you everywhere you go in everything you do amen you know sometimes you know when you you go you go somewhere you go to work or you go to school or you're in your Recreation and you know he's probably maybe staying in the car because is he comfortable where you are amen that's that's that's a it's a crucial question to ask because there's there's experiences with God and then there's a pineal experience that each one of us have to have where we take experiences and we make them a living reality within our soul amen we can't we can't put him into an area where he's something rather than being someone amen because there's a clear distinction between the two much of the world I believe is deceiving themselves because to him to them he's something rather than someone amen he becomes the the very driving point of every decision you make not because he has not because it has to but because you want to amen it becomes the very core of your being Amen to to to see what the word says about it and and to match up with what the word says because I am that word amen we are that word I I always have some quotes I want to go through this morning you know um just to refresh uh Refresh on that 1417 that even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth in you and shall be in you and with him the spirit of Christ Living in you and his actions are living through you you know nobody nobody knows nobody knows the heart except for God right you know but the manifestation of your actions in your everyday nature in your church attendance in the way that you act and the way that you dress and the way that you talk even the way you react makes it known which nature is ruling and reigning in your heart and I have this in my notes later on in in here but this isn't for someone to look at your brother or your sister and say well they don't have it they don't have this is all for self introspection you look at something like this and you say not not my brother not my sister but me oh Lord do I have that right now I'm not looking at everybody else it's not about everybody else it's about you individually recognizing amen what it is that you need to be doing um it's it it's is it the nature of Christ or is it the nature of Caleb Campbell amen which one one is really ruling right now he says in going beyond the camp 1964 paragraph 89 he says now brother sister do you know that each one of us each one of you all must sacrifice you must be God's sacrifice you sacrifice the things of the world you sacrifice your own pleasures of this world you sacrifice everything uh you sacrifice the things of the world you know the reason that people won't do it he says you know a sheep a sheep don't have one thing to offer and that's War and now he's not asked to produce or to manufacture some wool for this year he's asked to Bear wool so we're not asked he says to manufacture something we're asked to Bear the fruit of the spirit that is inside of the sheep what he is on the inside makes the wool on the outside and when a man has got Christ on the inside it makes him Christlike on the outside not some artificial put on and it's so important because I you have to recognize that it's from the inside out amen that those things happen because if you try to manufacture and it's from the outside in you're going to be straining he always I can't remember where the quote is but he says you're going to be straining your whole life because it's a it's a legalist style of things you're trying to manufacture something when you just need to get him on the inside and then naturally it comes out amen but making the valley full of ditches 1956 he says show me your company and I'll I'll tell you who you are let me walk into your house let me see what's laying open on your table let me see what what the Bible's marked up let me see where where it's the old stories let me listen to what kind of music you're playing on the radio let me see what kind of pictures you got in your house and I'll Tell You What You're Made Of yes sir that's what your soul is feeding on regardless of what your testimony is and your your fruits prove what you are right oh it's the truth your soul feeds on something and whatever the Char characteristics of your soul is that's what it'll show forth that's the reason Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them amen by your fruit you shall know them and I have just been listening to um the sermon right after going beyond the camp it's the Feast of trumpets you go listen to that sermon because there's so many things in there where he's showing that when the son of man comes to reveal himself how are we going to know that it's the son of man revealing himself unto you it's because you're going to be constantly in the word amen you're going to be constantly in the word to be able to recognize that when he comes oh I know because I'm like him amen you know because you're like him go listen to that sermon because he makes it so clear brother random had this situation in his life um he he he was home one day and and the phone rang and you know he was right in the middle of this situation where there was some attorneys and they were bothering him so bad about some case that that they were in and they wouldn't they wouldn't leave him alone and they were continually calling his house and on this particular day he was actually getting ready to go pray for this sick little child in the hospital so he tells me to to tell them that he wasn't there and in doing that he he says well I'm going to go run around the back of the house and when I do that when I'm outside tell them that I'm not here amen and you know because that's sometimes what people do when even when you have the Holy Ghost and you make mistakes you you can justify certain things that you do in your life amen amen I'm so glad we have these things as examples because we're all guilty of that amen and you know Ma kind of looked at him funny but he but did what he said and when she hung up the phone and he came inside she told him that she didn't feel right about doing that and you know but then he started he started justifying you know the his actions there and who's ever who's ever been guilty of that amen but when he got to the hospital to go pray for that sick little child the Lord began dealing with him how can you pray for this sick little girl after you did what you did see he had to make things right before he could go on you know and he makes this reference in this sermon I'm going to quote a few things here but he makes this reference to 1 John 3:21 if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence in in God and when the prophet was telling that story he quoted that scripture he said that's what's the matter today with the Christian Church they can't get anything done is because our hearts are condemning us for unconfessed sin it's not easy for him he's saying about this story it's not easy for me to tell this it's not easy for us to make those things right but it's the truth and that's the way to be truthful he says you know it's such a simple thing but it's so powerful here God was trying to get Jacob to recognize his position amen and God in this us recognize your position amen that there's nothing that can stand between you and your prayers but you have to come to a place where you're in complete submission where when you have a situation like this brother mat preached that condemnation versus conviction as Christians there's no condemnation but there is conviction amen and so when you have a conviction placed in your heart you need to make that thing right you know because we're going to read this because brother brandom when he did that and he had to go make that thing right it wasn't just oh you know Lord I'm sorry for this that there's no sincerity in that he went to MAA he went down to the attorney's office he knocked on the door then he went and the most important part of this is he went into his cave and he prayed for eight hours about a situation where he was just justifying something that most of us maybe wouldn't even think twice about but it is in important that we recognize that the spirit of truth that lives inside of you knows that these things are so important because if our hearts condemn us not then we can have confidence in God and nothing can stand in between our prayers amen there's there's two classifications here that that I'm that I'm trying to identify in this teaching and like I said earlier not for us to look at everybody else or anybody else really and try to identify but for each of us to do some self-reflection and really look at where you're at cuz one there's the two classifications there's ones that have already had a changed nature amen yet they make mistakes amen like what brother random did I believe he was born again of the spirit of God and he made that mistake but God corrected him amen but then two the ones that have had experiences with God like Jacob did at bethl but hadn't come to their pineal experience yet and truly had their nature changed amen they haven't come face to face with God and wrestled until they've fully submitted to his word amen and allowed him to change their name amen and change the way that they walk amen those things they're for our example amen he changed the way he walked that's a spiritual uh spiritual type of you changing the way that you walk it's it's you're going in One Direction God gets a hold of your life you're going in the other direction from now on Amen everything you do is now revolved around what God is doing for you amen and that's so important because it's important to know what place that you're in amen it's important because it's the difference having un experience with God and having that experience with God where your nature is completely changed is so important it's the difference Saints between making a Rapture and not you know because a lot of people I believe are going to be surprised the ible says surprised on that day when the dead Saints rise the Lord takes his family home to the marriage supper and it's time to go into a resurrection when they didn't make it and they'll find themselves in a tribulation period because they've never met God face to face and fully submitted they've had experiences of God they've had that experience but remember in that experience he came to that angel and that angel tried to leave but Jacob said no I'm not letting you leave until I know for sure that I've been blessed amen you've got to come to a place in your life where you know that you know that I've had that nature change amen wow many people have experiences with God Amen all the time all throughout their life but until they come to a place where they let the word have dominion in their life see Jacob was tired of his old nature taking control so what did he do he stayed all night because he was was ready he would have stayed all week he would have stayed all month because he was ready for God to change his very nature and it I believe the Bible is particular about how they word thing how it words things when he came in Genesis 32:26 he says the Ang and he said the angel he said let me go for the day break and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and many people I was fellowshipping with my dad about this many people get this far in their walk with God God that they get close to that baptism of the Holy Ghost and they may walk the line for a time but then they allow the enemy to come in and settle their mind down to think that this is as far as you need to go but there was further that Jacob needed to go there amen I know that that there they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that at that time but this is an examples they we use the Bible as examples for the for for the New Testament amen and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob it was until the two verses later that he changed his name from Jacob to Israel am two verses later that is the difference you brother brandom makes this he makes a statement my dad sent me this quote a few months ago I was trying to find it last night finally found it St Augustine had an opportunity once so says the history to become a great man and be filled with the Holy Ghost he sit in the back of the yard there in Lion's France at that great school yard and the whole the Holy Ghost came to him but he refused to accept it then what did he become a two-fold more child of Hell than he was to begin with he was right down to hippo Africa where he sat down and it was I can take you to the history he was the one who sanctioned the word to do it that it was all right to put to death any heretic who would disagree with the dogmas of the Roman Church St Augustine of Hippo is there a Bible brother this is brother brandom saying this in Christianity versus idolatry is there a Bible scholar here raise up your hand you um see there they St Augustine of Hippo he was the one who passed the verdict that said it was all right to kill Heretics who disagreed with the Roman Church shaning them Pagan doctrine of getting away from the Bible and establishing a son God worship he came to a place where he had an opportunity to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the prophet said and he turned it away and you know what what brother Brenham did we just talked about this he didn't just say that he was sorry he it it was at the very core of his being that he needed to make this thing right amen and he went and I just want to I just want to go through this quote here just a few more minutes uh thinking on our way 1959 and he says and I prayed all day long I said Lord God I did wrong and I caused my wife to do wrong don't hold it against her Lord please forgive us I want to stay clean before you Lord that's what I'm called to pray for the sick children and there'll be no condemnation in my heart I want to be right and that condemns me I couldn't pray for that little baby will you forgive me and I prayed and wept in there from about 7:00 one morning till about 3:00 or 4 in the afternoon there's a big rock layer that leaves at the M thee and it faces the East way back in the jungles and woods and I came out and got on this rock raised up my hands and just praised the Lord and I was standing there thinking on my ways amen we ought to stand there and think on our ways sometimes said Lord did I why did I ever do such a thing why could a man get so bothered but I'm so glad that you love me that you let me think of it that you revealed it to me that told me I was wrong that means you want me to do right that you loved me you ought to thank God when he condemns you for your sins and the things as you're thinking on your ways amen um we just have a minute here so I'm going to skip the rest of that quote but he said you know there's you know when you have that nature change you can still make mistakes amen but something is different from that time in your heart because that situation you know to the average Joe just was a situation that happened and they Justified it but to a Son of God it meant everything amen it's so important to examine our lives and see which nature is truly controlling you not the Sunday Morning View that people see it's the Monday afternoons the Tuesday nights the Friday nights the friends you choose the job you choose the things you wear yes I know that those are outward manif EST but brother renom said water baptism is also outward manifestation of an inward work amen so the outward manifestation is also important because it reveals what's on the inside amen and it has to be something so personal that takes place with you you know and you know Jacob had brought his family with Him scripture says this specifically but he was left alone when he wrestled with that Angel sometimes it's time to just get alone with God to think on your ways and have a pineal experience to encounter face that means encountering God face to face you know and it was always thought in the Old Testament if you ever came face to face with God you would die but God didn't want that he he couldn't be in your in your presence without that blood atonement that's why the Holy Ghost came so there was always a plan to reconcile you back to fellowship with him to have his spirit indwelling inside of you amen and when you're and when you have have that face-to-face encounter don't leave that place until you walk different until you talk different until you know that your name has been changed you know what Jacob was doing when he wrestled wasn't showing his strength I know I'm a little over time just another minute he was he was showing his weakness through submission amen some people think that Christian experience is is just pure grit hold on to something until you can't hold on anymore but it's the opposite of that amen he's wanting you to let let go
