as you see fit anoint the lips of clay to speak the ear to hear father may you have your way in Jesus precious name we pray if you have your Bibles invite you to the Scriptures in first John chapter 5 appreciate our musicians and we're just following the traditions of Bethel Tabernacle Wednesday night is Amen faith and deliverance night day so we believe that God can move on our behalf and and steer our hearts in the right direction is that right amen and so we want the Lord to have his way we bring you greetings this evening from the Saints in Flagstaff where we've been so journeying there as pastor of the little north country Christian Fellowship and and they are some of the finest people you ever want to meet so anytime you're out that way by we own the Grand Canyon our church owns a Grand Canyon and we are we are the sole possessors of that and so anytime you want to come and see that one of those great wonders of the world why just come on by we we have a lovely little group of people they will treat you so many ways you'll like one of them amen and Saint John are in first John I'm sorry first John chapter five and there we want to read verse eight first John chapter five and verse wait a minute I'm sorry oh that's why they're now they oh now it's looking a lot better let's go to verse three that's why it says verse three right there on that page and I was looking at the wrong thing here yes first John five and verse three and four there we go now things are starting to come together for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and His commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith may the Lord bless the reading of the word this evening as you have your seats levan preach this message called faith is our victory and our faith is the victory and I will make that the title this evening faith is our victory several things that we want to call to your attention here the first thing is the there's a grammatical definition of of a grammar within language and it is called a meta nanami and a meta Nanami what it is is where they use a word in place of another word and so if the dictionary example that they give us is if I was to say that there's a man that works at an office complex down here and I would say yeah he's one of those suits down there we call him a suit well a suit is a meta nanami for a businessman or if we were going to go to the track well track as a meta nanami for we're going to the horse races you understand or NASCAR whatever so you're using that word track the word faith that is used here in the Bible inch inverse form is as even our faith faith here is a meta Nanami and that meta Nanami stands for our belief it stands for the message it stands for the Word of God it stands for victories amen it stands for anything that you want to place in there and it references several things that I wanted to look at here there are faith it represents our belief it represents the gospel it represents the word it represents the message of the hour and so now then so when we look at this Bible verse here that says that that hour that that this is the victory that overcometh the world even our belief even the message of the hour because without this faith it is impossible to please God without this faith amen you are your your absent from the love of God for for because faith amen is what spreads that love of God in our heart by the Holy Ghost faith is a revelation for them tells us and so we find that when God reveals his will to you because faith was designed to know the will of God amen and the will of God is his word and so when God reveals something to him then you can stand on that it's the immovable aim every man said the Rock of Gibraltar was a great stone that was a it was a as a great monument of a great a great rock that was immovable he said by the said the rock of Revelation is even more unmovable than the Rock of Gibraltar hallelujah so where so when we begin to look at this faith and we want to just follow these some quotes that I have here and we're just going to hit these quotes as quickly as possible make a few comments and move on I have a lot of like little one-liners here that the Prophet gave us that are there you know sometimes you just need that one of those little little by little verses would call it but those little verses out of the book of Elisha Amen that you can just call on that and and you know that God will back it up because he backed up his prophet is that right but them says he's our refuge and while you're in this refuge you got right to anything that's in the refuge and so we go back and we find in the Bible tells us that there was six cities of refuge I believe it was and that these cities of refuge was a place for the man to run into when he was running from the manslayer and so if he had accidentally killed somebody or accidentally it'll cause bodily harm he could run to one of these cities if it was an accident and so it was it was graced to him once he entered into the city of refuge but once he got there he would be an alien he would be and not maybe not a resident there but once he got there then once he come through that gate and it shut behind him the manslayer was outside he was inside brother and said he can let off the pressure huh hey man hey what's he got in there he can let off the pressure and he says everything that was in that city of refuge now became his he said Christ is our refuge and everything you have need of is in him amen in sickness don't build up pressure let off pressure well I wonder brother branham you don't wonder you just let the pressure off commit your case to God and go on as if it was all over you say well is that like positive thinking is that is that apple pie in the sky is that a pipe dream is that there's an arrow amen here's it's not pretend friends it's faith in action because phase without works is dead and so you have to commit your way to God and go on as if it was all over don't build up pressure let off pressure I'm so worried brother Bannerman I just don't know let off the pressure in the city of refuge he took your worry so you don't have to have it cast your cares on him for he careth for you don't you worry about your cares all but man I got this problem and I got this business and and you know and and and this komen thing going it's breaking down the litter there the infrastructure and now with all these riots and now we got this this situation in that situation oh I'm so worried I don't even know if there's gonna be an economy I don't even know if there's going to be a tomorrow hey man don't worry about it what will wearing do for you Lee said he said well my faith he said what will faith do before he said what will fear do for me he said if they was going to execute me tomorrow he said what good would fair fear do me he said but faith might give me out don't worry about it watch I'll save this for the last that's the don't worry about it that's his business that's his business oh it's God's business to worry about your worries it's God's business to worry about your cares and he don't worry he don't fear he don't fret he don't slumber he'll sleep hallelujah from authority of God's Word just go like you've never had nothing wrong with you just bless God and be thankful just go active never had to can you imagine I believe our doctor here could tell us that people that accept or that fear the disease that usually overtakes from but the people who commit it to God and go on and keep a positive attitude many times just a positive attitude will get them past the sickness because the body is designed to heal itself or that God will allow the body and then God does the healing but remember said at the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass so if you if you had the mental attitude that you never had nothing wrong with you can you imagine oh well the doctor said this so the doctor said that or or or the you know my symptoms are this well if you if the Bible says that if you observe lying Vanity's you forsake your own mercy oh but if you can go on and take the Book of Elijah and say nothing's wrong with me maybe say well that would be Ryan they asked brother branham the same question he ate beans and onions and his stomach was all tortilla that's hardening of the stomach lining and then with the male they said you have to live with that is nothing we can do about it he went home he gave some beans and onions I like bold be pretty good a green chili in there the Easterners don't know anything about good food I'm telling you but you take you take it ain't that he's walking down the street they said brother how you doing so I'm healed in Jesus name my stripes I'm healed some healed said oh okay walk down there swallow it back there how you doing on the hill except buddy you're sick no I'm healed because his word says I'm quoting the word just like you had nothing wrong with you the prodigal son over in Luke chapter 15 I want to look there if we made by the way sister giant sends her love and greetings and she would have been with me but she had medical procedure today they had to give her a little shot of inflammation or any inflammatory in one knee and then they diagnosed her other knee with a torn meniscus and they scheduled her for a repair on that in August so we're glad to have them talked about having medicine said we appreciate our doctors who said they're a gift from God and so we appreciate our doctor he's he's very conscientious about her pain and so he wants to get that fixed as soon as possible so unfortunately August is as soon as possible I wish it could have been a little sooner but nevertheless so maybe a little towards the end of the year we'll get to come spend a little bit of time but as it is right now we're busy as a one-armed paper hanger in a windstorm that's busy Luke chapter 17 or chapter 15 I'm sorry and yes here we go and so I just want to read here just for a moment and for starting in verse 14 and so and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into the fields to feed swine and he would have filled his he would have would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him now watch this and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare and I perish with hunger now if you remember brother Abraham Myra actually took this thought when he was here and he was dealing with citizenship and the privilege of citizenship and but yet we find that this man was in a and was joined himself for the man of another country and so so now he had as an alien he had lost all of his native rights and so he was with this man now notice here that this is a Hebrew boy and this Hebrew boy has left his land of his Nativity he has now joined himself from a man of another country who is now has the diet of that country which is so contrary to what this young man was accustomed to because this man's diet was from the pigs that he fed they have no no value other than for consumptions you know and so so we can see here that he was of a different religion he was of a different nation and so they were so but we find here that this boy that this this protocol that he wasn't even eating the diet of the country that he was in but he was eating the diet of the pigs that were in that country he was eating pig food he would have liked to have eaten pig food but that the big they don't share I shared a little quote with my my daughters the other day that if you give to a pig every time he grunts and you give to a child every time it cries you will have a good pig and a spoiled child let that be a lesson but we find that this boy this this boy he was he he came to himself I want to pick up right there from them what the prophet of God says and that's what the church needs to do today that's important night is something that's how you know out there in the misty blue somewhere that's what the church needs to do at the next camp meeting or next year or at watch night on the 1st of the year or that communion service or whenever but no brevet said that's what the church needs to do today it's calm to themselves to realize watch what he says here who is your father for sometimes we act as though we have no Heavenly Father I believe that that's that's the the crux of the other of the situation we can say globally today that the world has rejected God they have turned their back on the only one that can help him and they have acted as though there was no recourse they've acted as know that there was no a Heavenly Father there was no accountability there's nothing there's no responsibility and that God doesn't exist and he's not there but let me tell you God cares God cares about their sin God cares about their their rejection God cares and he has indicted the generation well for the second crucifixion for all oh my this this here's a this is nuclear for all the goodness of Heaven belongs to the church what Brunel said you won't need divine healing in the Millennium you have a glorified body you won't need it so if that be the case but there's that goodness that's in the Millennium that peace that passes all understanding is in the Millennium if there's joy over there that's unsearchable and unspeakable then if the Holy Ghost is an earnest on a life that will never sin a lie a body that will never get sick a mind that will never be troubled over in that world and the Bible says that the Holy Ghost is the earnest oh then we're drawing dividends on a world hallelujah let me tell your friends Haven just make her withdrawal tonight just write a check in Jesus name and put what you need on there and cash it in to the to the Clearing House of God's Word and the abstract Haven the earnest the title the abstract has been paid for that debt has been paid in full and Jesus said it is finished or mine for all the goodness of Heaven belongs to the church divine healing salvation freedom from worry or anything all belongs to the church Jesus died and we inherit all that God has through him heirs of the kingdom rich rich my father is rich in houses and lands oh he holds the wealth of the world Romans chapter 4 and verse 3 just want to get a few of these Bible verses sometimes we get a little bit quote heavy not that I'm afraid of quotes by any stretch of the imagination but I just love it when the Bible and the message just dovetail together and create that that great rainbow of faith for God's believe in children rainbow rainbow Romans rainbow a man Romans chapter 4 and we start at verse 3 speaking of Abraham he said for what saith the scripture abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now it to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted as righteousness and so now that what if so his so here's one that believed abraham believed and said of those things and spoke of those things which were not as though they were and is that right and so the angel there the angel the Lord told Abraham you're gonna have a child by Sarah and so he believed it and he asked her said how do you feel sir she said I feel the same said it's all right it's gonna be a greater miracle five years ten years fifteen years later how do you feel Sarah's saying I feel I'm feeling nervous and it's alright you're going to hear we're gonna have a baby today the Lord closed we're gonna have a child and so we find said but just kept getting the pins in the bird I kept saying most people didn't know what bird is you know having knows without saying how many knows what bird is they're all over 60 that's why bird eyes diapers write that down so you don't forget it next time brother man says that he said get the bird I ready what was bird up bird I was a brand name I think of cloth diapers mostly women going 12 back the idea of a cloth diaper oh my goodness well but that's what they used back in the day and you had to wash them out that was a real problem but they were reusable so it saved a lot of money I'm just speaking by hearsay cuz I've never done that my dear wife bless her heart and so brother man picks this up here and I want to this is interesting thought I'm gonna I'm gonna bring right here a little abstract but I'll bring it back brother branham is talking about praying for the letters he says now when you get these letters now place the little handkerchief on your underneath garment so when you've got a prayer cloth from from random evangelistic association if you wrote in to Jeffersonville they would send you an envelope and there there would be a little card or a letter that would give you this little explanation as to what you were to do with the prayer cloth once you got it and and so then they would take it you pin it on your underneath garment he said if there's any sin in your life ask God to forgive you if there's this is not just for prayer cloths this is for when you come up here and stand this anytime you come for prayer anytime you've got a need make sure you take the promise get it on with your faith if there's any sin in your life ask God to forgive you if there's anything that you have done wrong go make it right what does the Bible says and many are sick among you and some sleep why because it did not discern the Lord's body and they didn't go take care of these things and they put the Lord's Supper is that's just the elements that's just representative how much more when you come to get anointed with all and get prayed for in the hands laid on you if you don't haven't done this other things first then you're not going to get past first base friends if you've done anything wrong go make it right if your pastor believes in healing have in there with you but if there is no one no pastor near get some of the Christians in the neighborhood in and pray and believe now what he says and then act as if it's already done I you know you think we should have a correspondence course or we should have some kind of a you know a seminar or some kind of a you know some sort of a you know two-week revival on how to get healed no it's in one paragraph repent believe be saved repent get right fix everything that's in your life nothing between your soul and your Savior come and anoint them with oil pray the prayer faith and they shall recover friends but people won't do the first works and so then pride stands in the way and now there's something between their soul and the Savior and now there's no possible way for faith to work but brother says if you met the requirements we'll get to it here in a minute when I want to follow that with another quote he said we send out handkerchiefs and so forth all over the world we'd be glad to send you one if you want we've got something here tonight to be prayed for and the biggest part and the greatest amount of miracles that I know of is being done by the mail huh why because they got the little paper they read it they did what they were supposed to they pin the pin on brother Branham and pray for it and then got healed and it was miracle after miracle after miracle so is that over is the days of miracles past if we preach such heresies as that then brother Branham said if we say that the days of miracles are past he said then that is a seed of discrepancy but I'm here to tell your friends that if you can believe and obey the scripture and follow them in the guidelines of God's prophet then the same benefit that they got in that day you will get in this day and if we ever needed it we need it today now that's for the sick and afflicted to be pray for now no matter what your troubles are what no matter what no matter what maybe yours is well I got a quote on that - better not better not lead you into that one he says no matter what your troubles are what kind of disease you God how bad off you are as he could pretty well covered all this I think when you accept Christ his word then you call the things which are as though they were not if they're contrary to God's Word the prayer of faith shall save the sick well if God said that that settles it then let's put our minds our hopes and act as though it's already done that's just already finished when we accepted Jesus 2,000 years ago said it's finished your healing was finished paid for in full in stripes in blood brother Graham said if he was standing here tonight Jesus Christ in the flesh he could not heal you he said because he already healed you he says by His stripes ye were past tense healed already hey man just lay claims on the promise that God has already made and and believe the Word of God when he said it's finished friends he meant it but you just get that out of your mind that your case is too hard nothing is too hard for God oh I love this quote may these people come to this meeting tonight may they come with such Stern determination what stern determination you know but I find that a lot of people come with with with Chef Boyardee determination with noodled determination dishrags determination huh wishy washy silly putty huh Plato some people who are silly putty is silly putty determination any old thing yes noodle determination way weakest water determination well you're not going to get anything like that but brilliant said may they come with such Stern determination that nothing is going to bother them no more watch may faith be instilled in their hearts look I just had to sit there and look at that for a good long while I just went and got my dictionary instilled this this this faith instilled well what you know I think we lose something they're just you know oh well it's just instilled it kind of got wife gone you know kind of osmosis kind of a you know who's got smeared on somehow I got no makeup he said with this Stern deterred may it be instilled well I wouldn't looked at the thesaurus I wanted to get a broader understanding of this word instilled it means to implant in green impress imprint introduce to engender to produce to generate to induce inspire or promote to foster or to drill into oh let me tell you I would determinated faith amen so that that faith will be drilled in the mind a man had to be instilled into me to be induced into me to be produced out of me hallelujah Oh glory to God to inspire oh could you what about inspired faith regulated faith revelation belief that the message of the hour because become Revelator into our souls in this such a way to promote to foster to inspire to infuse into to inject to indoctrinate or to teach I believe that many times that that's so perfect the Word of God because he said faith cometh by hearing hearing by faith the word the message hallelujah oh my may faith be in their heart instilled in their hearts till the devil's of Hell can't shake them no way oh my there comes the devil he tries to shake me and these kind of things that let me tell you the heavens will be shaken but that so that those things which cannot be shaken will be will remain the Bible says hallelujah he says we hear the question any turns would he find faith he never questioned whether he did find righteousness or whether he had fine Christians but would he find faith when he returned now watch was we've heard that many times but did you hear this part knowing that that would be one thing the people would let go on the one thing that he was saying that he needed to find when he come was faith and that's the one thing that people would let go on oh but we can have you know we can have choirs and we can have music and we can have singing and we can have organizations and we can have camp meetings that we can have prayer lines that we can have all these kind of things and that's fine and that's good and those things gender and and and propagate people into an atmosphere but faith comes by the word and the word must be a revealed word it must be a known seasoned word it must be a timely message because without them we can't , Moses's message we can't carve a Wesley's message we can't even come on Pentecost message because we're beyond Pentecost hallelu that's right we're beyond Pentecost he says this is no Pentecostal age this is Friday or you say well what about the chronological order of the spectrum and the stars and all line up no let me tell your friends the cedar goes out to the to the end of the consummation but there's a bride people that are being called out by a message and he's establishing their hearts and her words are separated from the rest of the tommyrot of this world I want to bring it to this because brother Branham referred to the emphatic die Glocke many times brother Branham references the die Glocke here he says the diagon says rather shall he find Z face these things not just a faith but the faith what is B faith but it was the faith that Jude tells us about beloved while I was diligent to write unto you concerning the common salvation I found it necessary to write unto you Amen exhorting you to contend this is one place for the man said we should contend earnestly for the faith be faith which was once delivered to the Saints that's the faith that they came out of an upper room on that's the faith then they said this is that we can't say that we can't say this is that Joel's prophecy and is it applied now there's a part of it that applies but it was fulfilled in the day of Pentecost but we could say that God said and then I'll send you Elijah the Prophet before the great and Carol the devil did terrible day of the Lord so what the Bible says and then he would turn or restore or turn the hearts of the children back to the Apostolic Faith we can say this is that and you'll give the same results today that they got on the day of Pinnacle when you see and recognize and act upon the Word of God for your hour if you want to believe tonight be of a good cheer it is I be not afraid what nothing is going to happen but good if you'll just believe him but I was talking about in the East he says that that when the in the in the east when the UM when the when the Shepherd was how to herd of sheep and I've seen this and and and and the Shepherd he just leads out across the street cars stop everywhere whole herds of sheep walk across the road cars have stopped why the Shepherd has the right-of-way that's the law the Shepherd has the right of way and so brother Bram says this and that's the way our Shepherd is amen he gets the right of way brother Brown said you committed to God there is no higher appeal he will lead a sheep and nothing is going to harm or bother them if you know that you have met his requirements and you've done all that you know to do this is important it's repented you know you've pinned a little pin on or or by faith sometimes you know if we don't have a per clock that's not some mandatory thing maybe you don't have a per cloth maybe don't have one but I can still pin faith to my heart and I can still I can still repent and I can still make it right and I can still do everything brother Brown said and then pin that faith to my heart and I know that I've met the requirements and you've done all that you know to do then faith doesn't waver it just sits still and thinks positive faith takes it's everlasting grip around the Rock of Ages and it doesn't move hallelujah Oh think about that amen just takes its grip around the Rock of Ages one thing is sure that's God's word will never fail no matter how critical critics might criticize it how educational might try to explain it away how they might do this that or the other but it won't stop it one bit it'll just happen the same as as John said God's able of these stones to rise of Abraham God's doing it God's going to do it his words are going to be fulfilled in their season and nothing is going to stop it but he's talking about his word now I'm so glad of that how glad I am now watch someone that's got an understanding this is from perseverant that was from uncertain sound I want to show you something here someone that's got an understanding that God has made his promise and something has struck you that you believe it that's understanding that God's promise is to you so first you have to understand I've got a situation I've got a need I've got a sickness I've got a trouble I've got a problem I've got this that or the other I see something in the Word of God I believe it I've read it in the Word of God and I believe or it can accept that to be my own personal promise property and I hold that gear to my heart I hold it there now watch over them says he says that's understanding that God's promises to you then something is going to happen I don't care nobody in the world can talk you out of it watch what he says you're on your road then nothing is going to stop you so what did he say about the word he said God's going to do it his words are going to be fulfilled in their season and nothing's going to stop it nothing's going to stop the word when it's in its season and when you take that word that's in that season and make it your personal property nothing's going to stop you or your faith either so you just move out in faith say it say it so act like nothing ever happened press right into it and watch the supernatural take place in your life but I said that Peter he said see all the father's given me will come see they believe it they act on it knowing nothing is going to hold them no matter how much you come in emotion how much you do it it won't work until that perfect faith has manifested and identified itself in you as a substance and when it's there there's nothing going to shake you from it what does it say and faith is the substance it's substance faith he said it's a sixth sense nothing's going to shake your faith from it now faith listen what he says about faith I've read this here before but I really like it faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it isn't a peacemaker faith is not a peacemaker well it just you know it's part of my my anatomy or as part of my genetics and well I'm supposed to have these because my mother had it and my grandmother had it and so now I'm supposed to have hog walk oh no faith isn't going to make peace with that he's not going to accept this I'm gonna roll over and take that layin down no sir that's gonna stand up gonna put his dukes up hey man go poopoo let's get it all my faith has got muscles my faith has got hair on his chest my faith is not gonna back down it's Bulldog face I was reading uh you know the other day talk about a stubborn man an obstinate man he said he said that obstinate man was was like a bulldog he said he'd bite onto something the only way you'd get him to turn loose is cut his head off that's one stubborn dog right there but I want my face to be that way I wanted to be an unwavering an unmovable it isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is faith it is to conquer conquer and victory is the same to conquer means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prison it means that sin that once ruled you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it you are you have whipped it you are greater than it is oh I feel religious about now hey man I feel religious too why because my faith is what has overcome the world when the world used to put a ring in my nose and drag me around to every perverted thing you can imagine and it had controlled me but then one day a man Jesus came and the Templars powers were broken amen and now my faith overcomes the world the devil tells me this and I whip it I slap it down I beat it down I step on it I conquer it Cuffy I throw it in jail I'm gonna throw it in the cave because he hadn't got no rights remember I told you that one time that some people want to read the devil his Miranda rights ain't got no Miranda rights the devil has no Miranda rights he's not a citizen he's an enemy combatant enemy combatants go to Gitmo they get thrown in some hole somewhere and forgot about it'll get no Miranda rights original Miranda there the devil whoa you have a right to remain silent and if you want to appeal and if you want to you know a jury of your peers and blah blah blah and pet the devil and pattycake and nothing uh the devil forget it man whip it beat it down conquer it because you're greater than it is he said I greater than that whenever says we're no match for the devil greater is He that is in me go back to the word do you believe that yeah you believe it with all your heart then I want us all to stand just III think we've gotten the message I want us to take this opportunity to do what brother Han said if you've if if you've got a need on your horn you know what your needs are you got a sickness or you've got a trouble or you got a a burden or you got a request of some kind everybody should have them we have prayer requests tonight we've got those they're sicknesses and things all around the world but you personally you know that you personally if you're alive and you're vertical and you're breathing right now then you you you've got a need and if you can't really put your finger on exactly what the need is the new consent Lord do you know what my need is I only think I know but he knows he really knows and so you take that need tonight and if there and you say war but I know that I can't really pin that faith arms tonight I can't really pin it on because I've got this problem right I got I got a problem it's like communion you know when it's I keep taking the Lord's Supper and he wouldn't want to go there and take the Lord's Supper unworthily well you surely wouldn't want to go get you wouldn't want to pray the prayer faith and know that there was something standing between your soul and your Savior right because he said don't you got to discern the Lord's body and this is the Lord's body so before we go to prayer we're gonna the Bible says Terry one for another and so we're gonna tear it just for a little while before we bring you up if you got a little something that you need to take care of you got a you need to just give it to the Lord take your burden to the Lord there right so you do that tonight you just take

pest house that we live in so we want to pray wanna make sure there's nothing between our soul the Savior and then we're gonna make sure that's all right and then we're gonna we're gonna pin that little request on to our hearts there are little underneath clothes we're gonna go down below the flesh below the spirit we're gonna go down in that cell that's so real and we're gonna pin that right
