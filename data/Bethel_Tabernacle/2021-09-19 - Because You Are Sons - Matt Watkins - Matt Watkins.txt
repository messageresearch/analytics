the brothers there in the back of the house for powerpoint and then praise the lord good to see y'all here in the house of the lord this morning it might be a few in number but i know there's quite a bit they're sick and out some traveling some away uh they're in cherokees so we're glad that you're here let's all turn to our bible let's turn to psalms i'm going to change and you can go and slay that powerpoint if you could and he bringeth them out of their distresses he maketh the storm a calm so that the waters thereof are still let's just pray i'd like to speak to you this morning just to title this because you are sons we're going to title that this morning because you are sons let's pray lord we thank you father for your abundant grace and mercy lord that we even stand here today is just a testament lord of your keeping power and your grace each one of us lord here today as we come lord have different needs different lord things upon our heart we did pray we just pray at this moment lord would you take complete control father knowing all the needs of the people lord those that are present those that are lord maybe under the weather are sick this morning i pray father you would touch them lord may you go to them great physician touch their bodies lord i pray that you'd bring restoration and healing lord and for your word this morning we pray that it would meet its mark may it hit its target lord we ask as we surrender now to you in jesus christ's name and the church said amen amen you can be seated thank you amen they're saying i'm muted no sound on me here are good now okay praise the lord that was on the internet david describes here and we've spoken actually in the past something very close to this uh along these same exact lines but david is speaking of these sailors and just keep your bible open there to psalms 107 if you keep that up on the screen and we'll get to your powerpoint actually uh here in a moment brother josh if you could i apologize to go back but let's bring the scriptures up we'll get that powerpoint here in a moment he begins describing these sailors and look at it let's pick it up again here in verse 23 they that go down to the sea and ships that do business in great waters so he's speaking of skilled men these are not novices but these are sailors they do business in their boat they know their boat they they're they're acquainted with it they know how to react in a storm they know uh they know what measures have to be taken and david says that but yet the the stormy wind has a rose and now they're they're toiling and they're struggling and they are fighting the water and they're fighting the winds and they're they're doing everything they can to adjust the cells and they're throwing down the anchor and they're they're trying to you know look at their their what you know their gauges and try to understand you know what are we we're not we're in a we're in a crisis we're in a calamity where we're we're going to be capsized and and so no doubt they they go through all of the human measures that they can they maybe have been in a storm before and they've uh you know they they've they've been been saved from that or their experience but david is describing this situation that has came upon them and he says they don't know what to do they've tried everything that they can try and he says here look at it verse 24 uh verse 25 for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth lifteth up the waves thereof if you have that on the screen brother josh psalms 107 107. let's look at it together psalms 107 and let's just look at that again he says in verse 25 for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind now who is commanding and raising the wind that has caused these sailors to lose control he this hello are you here this morning he commandeth the stormy wind sometimes it's god who causes the stormy wind for us to lose control and the bible says they throw up their hands they're at their wit's end they stagger like drunk men that's what the scripture says here in verse 27 let's look at verse 26 they mount up to the heaven they go down into the depths their soul is melted because of trouble so what's he describing their boat is going up and then their boat goes down and then their boat goes back up and then their boat goes down and they're there they're trying everything they can to save it they're exhausting all their human ability their exhaust another human experience am i preaching to anybody this morning amen they've gotten to a place to where they can't control the circumstances and it's not the devil it's not what they've done it's not the any of any thought of their own but he has put them in this scenario the bible says he calls us verse 27 they will to and fro and stagger like drunken men are at their wits in then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses he maketh the storm a calm you know the lord is the only one who can calm the storm that he caused amen only the lord can calm the storm that he caused so if he's the one who commanded the stormy wind he's the one who has the command the calm notice david says here they they're at their wits in that term that phrase simply means to have lost or exhausted any possibility or perceiving or thinking of a way out of despair right amen in short it means the end of human ability the end of all human resources the end of all human intervention it's it's it's the end of all human help there's no escape there's no deliverance there's no figuring it out there's only one you say brother matt then what's the answer god and notice this here in jeremiah chapter 17 if you have that on the screen you can put it thus saith the lord this is jeremiah 17 verse 5 thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord now listen very close to what jeremiah says here cursed so we already know the result we already know the outcome cursed cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departed from the lord for he shall be like the heath in the desert like tumbleweed that's what he's saying and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabited now let's let's let's go from cursed to blessed blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope is in the lord for he shall be as the tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year that means worried or concerned or stressed and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit so jeremiah describes two different types of people or he maybe is describing one person but sometimes we have one reaction and then other times we have another reaction that's really if we'd be honest sometimes we don't sometimes we do good and we react the right way and we look at a situation the right way and other times we fail miserably and we have nothing to do but to look at ourselves and say lord just forgive me that's all i can ask is for forgiveness but he's describing two people and and he says here the first person he talks about jeremiah says is that man cursed be that man this is a man who doesn't wait for the lord he just moves ahead of the lord he has trouble he has he has a problem and so he's going to problem solve it because that's what a man does he problem-solves and he figures it out right brothers he figures it out he puts his hand to work he's gonna he's got this he's gonna he's gonna make it work no matter what he's got to do he'll make it work at the end of the day it's gonna work out jeremiah is describing a man who doesn't wait for the lord to move but he takes matters into his own hands makes his own plans turns uh uh uh taking no matter what he's got to do he schemes he plans he manipulates no matter what he's he's going to solve the problem do you know what jeremiah says that man's life will be like the bible says he'll be spiritually in the desert that's what he says he lived in parched places his life will be notice what he says here cursing to be the man he shall be like the heath in the desert it's like tumbleweed it's just dried up it's rotted it has no life he says he'll be like that he should be like the heath the shrub he looks he's alive he's there he's breathing he's he's got life he's he's present but inwardly he's dry and he's empty amen he'll have no fruit no water which is the wellspring of life there will be no no uh a wellspring of life to his life he shall seed look at this he shall not seedy have your bible there if you do if you don't then please put it on the screen for me as i'm reading this he shall not see when good cometh so he never sees good he never has joy uh everything he looks at turns into misery he's isolated it means he's living in that parched place that isolated place now i want you to look you say brother matt who is he describing the man who trusts in man the man who trusts in man that may be another that made it made be a a job a career an income it may be yourself your ability your intellect no matter what it is he's trusting in himself he'll make it he won't die he'll keep going but he'll be dry he'll be barren he'll be fruitless now listen to what what david said what jeremiah says though his life is is is he won't see when good cometh but notice what he says to the man who trust in god in hard places a man who trusts in god in a tight spot in a hard place when he can't when he doesn't see it clearly when he's in distress or turmoil or in calamity or in crisis notice what dave notice what jeremiah says blessed is the man verse 7 blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope is in the lord jeremiah says this man is planted amen he's rooted does he does he get tossed to and fro just like the man who trusts in the arm of flesh the same exact way he's he's he's in the storm the same exact way he goes through the uncertainty the same exact way he doesn't have the answers the man who's trusting the lord doesn't have the answers no more than man trusted in the flesh the man who's trusted in the lord goes through the same trouble as the man who's trusted in flesh he feels the same pain he suffers the same the difference is his trust is in the lord and jeremiah says he shall be like blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord who's over the lord for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river he has stability he has roots he has a foundation don't you love this he has a reservoir of living water that he can draw from he's spreading out he's fruitful he's green and he shall not be careful that means to be fearful that means to be in anxiety or stress in the year of drought when things get uh get when things don't make sense when things aren't adding up yet there will be an inward peace and an inward security that he has i want to be the man who trusts in the lord in spite of anything that's happening in my life he trusts in the lord he's and and and david begins to david begins to describe this this storm i want you to notice and we're going to pick up some of what we spoke on wednesday he begins to describe this storm that god has caused and god has caused the stormy wind and god has raised the waves god is the one who has brought this storm upon this man and david says they cry out they toil they beg they they try everything in their human resources till finally they get to the point to where they throw up their hands and they're not quitting notice there's a difference in throwing up your hands and surrender and throwing out your hands and giving up we preached on wednesday of never never never surrender there's a difference when you give up and you give in and when you raise your hands and you're at your wit's in and you cry out unto the lord david says then notice this in psalm 73 he says there are in psalms 107 sorry he says then they cry verse 28 then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still verse 30 then are they glad i love this then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven let me just stop here and say the lord is going to get you to your desired haven he's going to get us to the desired haven it may go through storms and we may go through a lot of uncertain times but just know this he's going to get us to the desired haven i'm thankful for that we spoke on wednesday about this man and this i heard this minister speaking about statistics of drowning and how many people drown in shallow water and and and he gave the statistic of accidents that happen uh to people fatal accidents statistically there's a it's a forget what the number was the percentage was but they the the the accidents that happened within three or four miles away from being home isn't that incredible to think about isn't that incredible speaking to brother travis who's uh just under the weather this morning was speaking yesterday about this and he was telling me even as one of his best friends who's a surfer and has surfed all over the world and in different places and he says what's incredible about what you're saying is the greatest most horrible tragic accidents he said this this guy has served you know i don't want to give a number let's talk the surfers say no that was he didn't serve a wave that big it was big waves he surfed really really big big waves and really deep oceans and he said none of the accidents none of the none of the injuries that he's ever had has happened in the deep water it's never happened under the deep big big depths but all of the accidents have taken place in shallow water and just a few feet of water and and not even under not even on the big giant waves but on the little surfable waves where there shouldn't be an accident yet the most you're the most prone let me just say this you're the most prone to accidents when you are closest to shore in other words you're the vulnerable you're at your most vulnerable and satan knows this you're at your most vulnerable point when the storm is just about to let up hello somebody when you're just about to come out of the trial when you're just about to make it when you you've already survived the worst of it you've already made it through the worst you've already made it through the deep isn't it a tragedy that something that you can survive something you shouldn't have survived yet you made it through but now something that you should be able to survive and is survivable and you end up drowning in shallow water when you could make it you're at your most vulnerable because trials are sort of like that you know they they come and as we said on wednesday they come in in various forms some are uh maybe a crisis that happens to somebody and then man suddenly you're just in it just like that and then some others are steady or over time something that's wearing on you and it just wears you down and wears you down and wears you down but you know sometimes we we we get it in our mind and i'm just going to say this here this morning as job struggled to find the lord we spoke last about jeremiah struggling to find where's the lord in in all of this and even got to a place to where he's asking god to take his own life elijah got to the pla same exact place asking god to take his life your brother branham got to the same exact spot just wants to give up give in put a gun to his head after he had survived so much after he went through so much and and and and he speaks about this and i wanted to just go just a little bit further on that even the apostle paul i want you to turn to second corinthians chapter one we're just going to look at this take just a minute here for second corinthians chapter one if you have your bible if you would turn also they'll put it on the screen if you don't second corinthians chapter one i want you to look at the apostle paul here who the bible says he had he had given his entire life and spent from his conversion he's dedicated he's consecrated every breath in his body all of his uh uh all of everything that he did was was for the purpose of the gospel being spread for the purpose of the kingdom of god we could say that he'd given up the whole world and he said it this way that he might win christ think about those words here just for a moment i may get just get a little bit practical and that's okay that i might win christ what does that mean that i might win christ this is what paul says i've given up everything i've counted everything i've learned everything previous as dung what paul equated everything that he knew i'm just giving you his own words yeah i counted as dung that i may win christ so in other words it meant everything to him he was dedicated he was sold out he was committed to the calls i want to be committed to the calls i read paul's words and i say lord i want to be that that consecrated to where i could say i count everything as lost that i might win christ that i can be that sold out the where he gives every part of his being every breath to the master this is a man who had great revelation in so much he says that there was a thorn given me just to keep me humble amen then he said i knew a man of a man called to the third heaven and paul speaking of himself and he heard things that aren't even lawful to be uttered and he says therefore because of the abundance this is his words of revelation amen because of the abundance of revelation so that i wouldn't become exalted the lord gave me a splinter of thorn a prick in my flesh to keep me humble we don't realize sometimes the things god puts in our life and he doesn't tell us but the difficulties and calamities and things that he brings that we're praying and praying and praying god why does this happen to me and we don't realize the lord puts that in her life to keep us grounded and humble and and in our proper place that's why we say no matter what the lord does he's a good good father and whatever he does in our life whether we know it or figure it out he knows best can you say amen paul says he he prayed three times over this and lord said my grace is sufficient for you in other words it's enough it's enough paul it's enough for you to have my grace but i want the answer it's enough to have my grace the man had revelation uh he had seen the lord you know he's not not one of the disciples but he's seen the light that appeared and said saul saul why persecute us i mean who are thou who was speaking to paul this was the lord jesus and this was a man who had the spirit of of god had had so descended upon paul he was given the very mystery of the gospel and the bible says that he would paul would go to asia and and notice when he's now i want you just to pick this up in second corinthians chapter 1 verse this was a man who had great authority we could say great contact a great relationship with the lord one-on-one and yet now read what we find here in second corinthians chapter one verse eight this is when paul goes to asia asia to preach the gospel for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble of our trouble which came to us in asia do you do are you familiar with that word trouble amen anybody know what that word is anybody that can say i've i've i could i could give you my life story and i could tell you about trouble i could tell you a lot about trouble but are you a son of god are you a daughter of god listen this is what paul says for i would not have you ignore in other words i'm not going to i'm not going to hide this i'm not gonna just gonna shun i'm not just gonna give you all the highlights i'm not gonna give you all the greatest things and all the you know paul could have just left all this out he could have never told us about any of this and could have just told us about this life full of ease and life full of comfort and full of the glories and full of the revelations and the abundance of mercies and all of the good things that happened to him i'm so glad that he didn't do that because i would feel so disconnected but when he says brethren i don't want you to be ignorant of all the trouble i had listen for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia that we were pressed notice this the trouble that we were came so god had been using paul in a in a a a powerful way in ephesus all the way through all of asia and the great revival has has fallen and two years later the revival fires are burning him and and the bible says in acts 19 the word of god grew mightily and god the power of god the word of god prevailed no doubt demon spirits were cast out and miracles were taking place and all of the wonderful uh the the lame and the sick were being healed the blind eyes were being opened the deaf ears were hearing and paul his ministry was at the very center of everything that was happening the revival that was happening anointing handkerchiefs and aprons and he lays them upon the people and here comes healing and here comes deliverance and verse 11 of acts 19 and god wrote special miracles notice this actually acts 19 uh verse 11 and god wrote special miracles by the hands of paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases this is verse 11 and verse 12 and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out from them amen there's such miraculous that ephesus falls under repentance and repents and a revival breaks out and and and here's here's a massive here's a massive outpouring of the spirit of god and satan is thwarted and satan is defeated and there's rejoicing and and all of these all of these what you could call miracles like mount carmel for elijah taking place he had he had he was living at the center of this revival fire seeing god move but now look at second corinthians chapter one turn back there if you could and verse seven uh verse eight second corinthians one verse eight for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia notice this second could this is if you could get there quickly second corinthians chapter 1. he says we were pressed out of measure this is verse 8. we were pressed out of measure what does that mean we were above our own human ability we were pressed out above measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life paul your ministry what's happened your the miraculous the healings the power of god and he's going to spread the gospel and now what does he find trouble amen trouble trials tribulation we were pressed out above strength in so much that we despaired even of life he got to a place where he thought it's over it's going to end this is it this is what he's meaning here we despaired even in life this is this is how it's all going to end after all of the work and after all of the labor and after all of the toil and after i've surrendered all of my breath and all of my energy and all of my body to the lord this is what i get in repayment this is isn't this how what the devil told brother branham when he says look at you and look at your ministry and his baby's in the hospital dying his wife has already died and he says look at you and he gets him to start considering his own life and he says you've given everything yeah that's true you've given your whole life to the gospel that's true you've stood there no one likes you all of your friends have forsaken you they all think you're crazy this is where the avenue the devil begins to use with reasoning all of your friends think you're crazy all the pulpits have been closed down to you and you've watched god heal the sick in your own meetings and when it comes to your own baby and brother branham says all of those things that he said were true i thought he was the son of god i thought he was a prophet of god i thought that the tru i thought that the righteous don't have trouble they don't have storms you know we bought into this idea somehow that because of trouble or because of turmoil it must mean god is absent as we said last wednesday don't ever don't ever believe that the presence of the storm or the trouble or the trial equals the absence of god it's quite the contrary because of the presence of the storm you may not see him physically you may not feel him emotionally you may not hear his voice in your spirit but here's his promise i'm there here's his promise whether you feel me or see me i'm right there in the middle of it what does he tell isaiah i think it is behold i'll go with you through the fire and and he says and the flood waters won't drown you for i'll be with you doesn't say that you'll see me doesn't say that you'll hear me doesn't say that you'll spit that i'll speak to you just know this i'm there paul says the sentence of death uh oppressed above we even despaired even of life uh even of life he's he's he says here let's look at it again we were pressed out of measure verse 8 above strength in so much that we despaired even of life thought it was all over overwhelmed would be a good word you could use and we're going to get to here here in just a moment he was brought so low that the apostle paul says his strength was gone we had the sentence of death verse nine we had the sentence of but we had the sentence of death in ourselves we had the sentence look here in other words i couldn't say i couldn't i i had no like these sailors i had no human remedy i had no human hope i had the sentence of death i couldn't see there was no way humanly possible how how could something like this happen to a man like paul the apostle paul notice this even even paul begins to describe this and he says for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote to you with many tears not that you should be grieving you might know the love which i am more abundantly unto you so he says here in verse 5 for when we were coming to macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears this is chapter seven sorry brother josh chapter seven verse five four he says for when we were coming to macedonia where our flesh had no rest we were troubled on every side without where fightings within were fears paul you had fear come on yeah paul you had trouble uh-huh without there was all trouble on every side within was fear within within within my mind was voices of doubt of despair within my heart within my body within my in my emotional realm the devil was attacking on every side but you speak to the lord paul yeah you have a relationship with the lord paul i did but yet trouble was all around on every side you see this is exactly how satan designs it satan's design is that he plants fear inside of us by looking at circumstances he'll speak to our mind he'll whisper in our ear he'll he'll he'll distract us in any way that he possibly can and to wear our confidence we lose our confidence in god we lose our confidence in faith we lose our confidence in people and and paul says without were fightings within we were troubled on every side and within were fears i want you to look at verse chapter one brother josh go back to chapter one and let's look at verse nine again notice what he says here he says but we have the sentence of death in ourselves here's why that we should not trust in ourselves but in god who raiseth the dead do you see where paul's faith was in god removed faith in so much that he moved his faith completely out of himself and not just to have faith in god for deliverance but even that if he died he could raise the dead it was faith paul says that the that that the that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raiseth the dead you know asa gets to a place and the asaf this is a uh uh psalm that you know very well i just want to look at it in psalms chapter 73 we're just gonna go just a little bit further psalms chapter 73 turn there in your bibles and also on the screen if you have it brother josh asaph was a a chief singer a levite this was a a leader of king david's worshipers his because his choir you know i don't i don't know all the details to that or or the you know the ins and out of that i can just tell you what the psalms records not every psalm we know that not every psalm was written by david but this is asaph and and he's he's a chief singer the bible calls him and he's a levite and he's he's he's he's a praiser he's a worshiper uh he was a man who was a close friend you could say that a close friend to david and so much that he david would put him in this kind of position no one could even be a levite serving in god's house you couldn't be in this position without having a relationship with david and and so david loved god and he loved worship and he loved being in god's house he tells us that one thing about his art i'd love to be in the lord's in the temple of god all the days of my life so this this man asaph was playing an important role any and he's cold he's he's a uh a a a a man with a ministry a man who's you could say is in close contact with the lord but notice what david what asaph confessed in psalm 73 and verse 2 but as for me let's just look at verse 1. we'll back up and read verse 1. truly god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean heart verse two but as for me this is asaph my feet were almost gone my steps had well nigh or nearly slipped now this was a man being honest he's called he's a chosen vessel of the lord a worshiper of god writing psalms and he says but as for me he says my feet were almost gone my steps had well nigh slipped now asap was a good man not a sinner not a backslider this was a a pure heart pure mind and he's asap he says this he's he's he's he's saying truly god is good to israel this is how he starts the psalm even as such as our of a clean heart in other words god has been good to me i have a clean heart before the lord and god has been good to me yet the very next verse he says but i there's a confession here's an admitting i almost fell i almost slipped now i don't know don't know and i can't find anywhere in the bible where it records why asaph never really says you know asaph being that close to david watches david fall watches david get entangled in adultery and then murder him has a has that woman's husband uriah murdered maybe i don't know maybe you're that close to to david to king david and you have that much confidence in him and you watch a man who has been so high and mighty in your mind and you watch him fall to such a low fall fallen adultery that would shake my confidence and shake your confidence you put trust in people i don't know i'm just i don't know if that's what he's speaking of when he says i almost fell my feet almost slipped in other words he almost turned back and and asap says my feet almost slipped i almost fell and and maybe it was maybe it was because of that maybe it was because of what he's seen and what he watched and he could just look at it and say you know this just isn't for me you know i can't i can't believe you know the the this is this is more than what i could bear regardless of what it was i don't know but regardless of what it was in aces asap's heart as he says that i almost fell i almost slipped and you know what you know what asaph began to do and we know this from verse i want you just to look here and we're just going to go a little bit further than this he says this is this is this is the psalm of asap keep going past that uh let's go to verse 14. that'd be good notice this what he says for all day all the day long i have been plagued and chastened every morning now he begins to turn just like jeremiah just like job just like elijah and they start to turn the tables and that trial and that misunderstanding then goes to blame and blaming and calling and and blaming and giving or or or uh uh blaming god for neglect amen blaming god for injustice he says for all the dealing i've been trust this this word plague the hebrew word plagued means chastened in other words he's saying i wake up and i have pain i'm touched by sorrow and i feel like i'm being punished and he says in verse 15 just let's just keep going through this if i say i will speak thus behold i should offend against the generation of thy children keep going to verse 16. when i thought to know this it was too painful for me he says for i was this is this is what he starts to look at he says in verse three for i was envious when i saw the poverty the for i was envious of the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked now hold on a minute asap where are you going with this in other words how does someone who doesn't love god who doesn't have anything to do with god who mocks god who mocks me and that man's blessed and he has he's foolish and he's blessed he's proud he has prosperity he prospers how does the hell is when i saw the prosperity of the wicked and now he looks and contrasts his own life and poverty and says yet i give everything to god i'm a worshiper of the lord i i've dedicated my whole life i've given all my i've given my body i've given my breath and yet here i am in poverty and struggle and anguishing trouble yet the wicked and this asap says this is this trips me up it causes me to stumble when i try to rationalize how does it how does it work out this way how is this fair is that a fair question to ask how is this fair how how how does god look at all the foolish look at all the sinners they don't pray they don't read their bible they don't go to church they neglect the lord and neglect his word it means nothing to them and yet they're not plagued as i'm plagued they're not in trouble as he says in psalm 73 verse 5. look at verse 5. uh he's if i was envious and foolish keep going brother josh if you could verse verse 4 keep going please for there are no bands and they're death but their strength is firm keep going verse five they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men you know what he was really saying they're not plagued like i'm plagued they don't have the trouble that i have and you know i give everything to the lord i've given my entire life while i'm denying myself and giving myself they grow rich and prosperous while i'm weak with sorrow their strength only increases verse 11. notice this as he goes further in this keep going and they say how does god know and is there knowledge now he's he's getting close to the line here is there knowledge in the most high in other words does does god not even is he not seeing the seeing this is there no does he not have a problem with this doesn't he see what's happening isn't he aware of this massive disparity between the righteous and the unrighteous when it comes to suffering and pleasure and poverty and prosperity he says is there is is is they say how does god know is there knowledge in the most high fair question how do they prosper yet we're constantly being deprived how does god have you ever wondered that question and asked how are the wicked devil worshipers i mean you can give some of the most heinous examples and yet physically and everything that you see it looks like riches and it looks like wealth and it looks just like pleasure and it looks just like prosperity and there's reward and they're promoted and i'm demoted and yeah i'm serving the lord and i'm paying my tithes amen amen internet audience amen yet they're given to the yet i'm given to the lord yet now now you see he starts to rationalize this from a human perspective and anytime you look at human pers anytime you look with your human perspective you only see through temporal temporary shallowness and veneer what you don't see is underneath that veneer of glitter and glam and happiness what looks like apparent happiness and looks like apparent prosperity there's a life that's full of drugs full of depression full of anxiety full of suicide at a young age it may look like it glitters and it pops on the outside and it looked that way to asaph in so much he says lord i don't understand it but what you miss is god's perspective at the issue because while you may not have much in earthly goods and you may not have much in in like in comparison to their life what you do have that they don't have is an eternal promise and an eternal hope of heaven and an eternal peace and an eternal joy that outlasts all of the worldly joy and in the time of calamity and the time of trouble yeah you're planted and you're rooted and you're grounded and you have faith in your heart hallelujah oh when moses came out of egypt he forsook all the pleasure and he forsook all the riches and he forsook all of the all of the popularity but and he looked like he came with nothing in his hand but you know what moses did have he had a promise from the man who created the whole world and that promise meant more to him than all of the treasures of egypt because they were shallow to the point notice this verily verse 13. let's just turn from that we're at 12 37 now just running out of time i want you to get to my powerpoint if you have that let's look at it quickly if you could just for a moment notice what brother adam says here he says let us examine this is the legacy in church age let us examine the first phrase as many as i love in the greek the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun i he does not say as many he does not say as many would feel he should say as many as love me listen not as many as love me now you know the scripture that brother brandon is referring to as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealoths therefore and repent right amen that's the admonishment in revelations 3 to the ladies in church age as many as i love now brother branham says now the personal pro now notice upon that he says the greek emphasis is upon the personal pronoun i he does not say as many would feel he should say as many as love me no sir we must never try to make jesus the object of human love in this verse no it is the many that are the loved ones of god it is his love in question not ours so once again we find ourselves glorifying in his salvation his purpose and his plan and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty of god even as he said in romans 9 13 jacob have i loved does it now obtain listen to this that since he loved only the many is he therefore in a state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn nigh him by no means is this so listen to what brother bannon says here even as he said jacob ever loved jacob have a love does it now obtain the since he loved only the many is he therefore in the state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn out of him by no means is this so for he declared in romans 9 13 esau have i hated and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil amen follow jacob have i loved esau have i hated and paul says god made that choice god made that statement god looked at it that way prior to either one ever being born amen now if you don't believe that you just don't believe the bible this isn't a brother branham doctrine this is a bible doctrine brother branham's doctrine was what brother brennan didn't come with any thinking of his own or any teaching of his own it's a restoration of bible truth now we're looking at the love of god why the sons of god go through trouble and wicked prosper why the sons of god go through storms and go through trials and go through trouble even paul we looked at jeremiah we looked at elijah we looked at god's prophet and and you say brother matt why don't we look at all those so that you could know that if they went through it with the close-contact relationship we ought to expect the same thing for our lives and remember what paul said don't think it's strange when fiery trials are trying you don't think it's strange he says notice this he he in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil that this is the bible here in romans 9 that the purpose of god according to election might stand every thing that encompasses everything in life history past present and what happens tomorrow has never been about never ever ever ever been about what man the purpose of man or what man could accomplish or what man's going to do do you realize that that's on a that's on a that's on a large scale let's go to a microscopic scale your life not from the day you were born or the day you graduated high school or college or had a family your life has never been about your purpose whether you've ever realized that or you realize it presently it's never the world doesn't revolve around you amen it's always been for this that the purpose of him according to election might stand not of works but if him that calleth this love is say it with me elective love it is his love for his elect and his love for them is a apart from human merit for it says that the purpose of god stands an election did you follow what brother branham says here he says this love this elective love is apart from merit in other words lord i'm so grateful that you love me let me go through my list of everything i must have done for you to love me it doesn't have anything to do with what you've done or what you're gonna do or what you did before it's election it's apart from any human merit for it says the purpose of god sends an election once is exactly opposite to works or anything man has in himself because before the children were born he had already said jacob have i love but esau have i hated and now he says to his own go to the next line and now he says to his own paul's look this way i'm going to raise my hands i'm going to invite you to raise your hands with me i believe i am his own and i believe he's speaking to me and now he says to his own as many as i love i rebuke and chase him to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with the view to correction chasten does not mean to punish you know how many times we've looked at the chastening hand of god i'm just being punished it's just a punishment because we relate that or correlate that to our children or our child uh with with punishment i'm here i am in punishment you know we act like children sometimes with god we act like spoiled rotten children amen okay well i do maybe you don't want to admit it oh i'm just being punished you got to look at it you've got to look at it god's way it's not punishment because the way that we mean that is god's just hurting me because i hurt him and i'm messed up so he's going to mess me up and i made a mistake and i'm just reaping what i sow well yeah you know sometimes you do reap what you sow that is a law but the the corrective as many as i love i rebuke and chasten it's not punishment it's correction let's simplify that what is correction correction is when you correct i know that was real scientific and real uh you know i'm sure that you're you're you're missing it went right over your head it was so simple it just means to correct what does it mean to correct when your back's out of when you're when you when you're crippled and your back's messed up what do you do you go to the chiropractor so that he can correct your spine when you're in a car and you're going off the road you correct the car you correct it so his punishment why do you go through trial why is there tribulation why through tests because god sees the car veering off the road and so he brings correction amen all right chaston does not mean to punish means to discipline because the subject's amendment is in mind what does god have in mind when he starts sending trials your way and he raises the stormy wind this is what god has in his mind amendment this is exactly what we find in hebrews 12 5 through 11. give me about can i have about five six minutes raise your hand if you grant me that sorry for those that don't grant me that and you have forgotten the exhortation listen and you have forgotten the exhortation he's quoting here this is hebrews 12. you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastity of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chastiseth not but if you be without chastisement next line but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are you bastards and not sons illegitimate furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we give them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness why whenever god corrects you it's for your profit but if you be without chastisement where for all the protections let me go past this now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous amen amen no chastisement for the present right now what i mean brother man you don't understand it doesn't feel too good it's not supposed to no chastisement in the present seems joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby listen to what brother adam says here i'm going to close hearing is now set forth the love of god he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons sons like himself there before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor out of the same lump god is god is you ever that's why we say everything that's happening in the world today is because of him some to righteousness some to unrighteousness some to honor some to dishonor herein is now set for the love of god and his art of family he says there out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his next slide the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to his image in their walk he reproves with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens next slide he chastens with nail scarred hands isn't that beautiful sometimes this potter must take the vessel he's working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be he chastens he rebukes asaph you might not understand why you're in the trouble that you're in but just know god ordains the trouble you may not understand the trial you're in but just know god ordains the trial are you with me god ordains the stormy wind to raise god is the one who causes the stormy wind to raise as he says in psalms he says he he commandeth the stormy wind uh he he speaks to the stormy one i want to read you something i wish i could have displayed it brother jason to mars who's there i forgot to even mention vacationing there with his family in tennessee he said this to the ministers chat this morning just our group of ministry here so beautiful from a southern baptist minister paul washer i'm sure you've heard of paul washer sermons and he says something i just want to read it here it fits so well he says how is it that god demonstrated love towards jacob and hatred towards esau you never see one time god disciplining esau never once you never as many as i love i rebuke and chasten right paul says in romans 9 we read it jacob have i loved east all have i hated he made that choice before either was born he says you never see one time god discipline in esau never once but you see god beating jacob every day of his life when jacob came back into the land esau was so prosperous that he had no need of any wealth from jacob but when jacob comes back to the land he was limping and broken and had a new name what a portrait here's esau here's jacob when jacob comes back esau spends his life without correction without discipline from the lord jacob spends his whole life getting beat and spanked and disciplined every single day imagine jacob not looking around going god what in the world what's happening you spank me you discipline me man i can't get away with nothing and all esau gets away with everything you ever had a brother like that man he gets away with with everything man jonathan got away with everything didn't he chris or beat every day he could just get away with bank robbery and somehow he could always go and talk his way out of it i mean he in so much that when we would get in trouble and it didn't have anything to do with jonathan would say john go and be our lawyer plead with dad you can complete our case we just and he jonathan would go in there we wouldn't say nothing we'd just stand there and we'd get out of it true story could you imagine jacob could say this man i don't get away with nothing i just messed up just a little bit and bam esau spends his whole life you never read one time god ever disciplined and they're doing anything but jacob gets beated every day of his life and here jacob returns to the land and here's esau prosperous wealthy standing straight up and here comes jacob limping in the bible said he walked with a limp and he doesn't even have his name anymore god's renamed him i love this he says jacob when jacob came again esau was so prosperous that he had no need of any wealth from jacob but jacob was limping and broken why god disciplines his children why god disciplines his children because you are sons and discipline reproof correction it's never about punishment it's never about harm or damage or he's going to get you back for what you did don't ever look at it that way but god says you're my child and out of the same lump of clay when you start when you when your life begins to get deformed from my image of what i had for my son i'm gonna bring correction and that correction may not always be easy it may be painful but rest in this it's for your good it's for your profit it's it's so that you can prosper maybe not in the same way your neighbor prospers and i think so many times we try so hard to chase after our neighbor's prosperity and god says i'm not calling you to that kind of prosperity i've got a different prosperity for you and and it's and until you settle in with that fact you'll always be it you'll always be at war you'll always be in a struggle you'll always be contending you'll be like the heath in the desert you'll never have life but if you just surrender and rest and give it to god and say lord i lord i plan i want to be planted where you want me planted i want to chase after what you want me to chase after i want the prosperity that you want for my life i want the health that you've intended for my life i want the kind of life and shaped in the kind of way that you the potter my master my father has intended for me i love that so much jacob came back limping esau spent his whole life without discipline why because god disciplines his children that's love that's love asaph you might not understand it but that's love that's the love of god that we sing about when we say oh love of god oh how rich and pure how measureless and strong that may not be how the world has defined love that may not be how the world defines love and and they and they they they may not look at it that way at all and the world doesn't look at it that way and even the church world systems don't look at it that way but that's how god looks at it and that's all that matters we're not here to be pleased they they build churches massive many member thousand member churches and they they they poll pull the neighborhood and send a census through the neighborhood what kind of church do you want what kind of preacher do you want what kind of topics do you like what kind of what kind of music do you like what kind of band do you like and then they build a church based on the consensus i'm not making this up this is real they build a church in that neighborhood when they're doing a church plant based on the consensus of their polling numbers still you realize that they've reversed the love of god and now it's become the object is now the people and what they want and they build a church around their desires why do you think the bible says they would there would come a day when they wouldn't endure sound doctrine but they would heap unto themselves having itching ears teachers and they've built churches and they've built massive thousand many member churches where every day is about a skit and every day is about a play and about a drama and you have coffee in the vestibule and you bring your coffee and your donuts in church and you hear oh it's good preaching good i mean some good really good stuff and you can get little clips and snippets of really good things about health and about wealth and about prosperity and how god loves you and god's for you and god's with you and all of those things are true but do you realize it's what's that's why that's why jeremiah says that man will be like the parched desert he'll live spiritually dry that's why the churches have no life but you know we build when we build a tabernacle or sanctuary or we say we say we want a church it's not about what we want it's not about what we want preached it's not about what we want to hear it's about lord how can we be in subjection as your children to your purpose and to your plan and what you want for our lives i want to be the man who trusts in the lord who's like a tree planted by the rivers of water whose fruit and whose branches are spreading out in fruitfulness you say brother matt does that mean numbers no it doesn't doesn't mean numbers it doesn't mean big new churches or big fine steeples as brother branham says but what is where's the beauty of the church it's in the beauty of the hearts of the people because know you not you are a temple of the holy ghost you are the dwelling place of the lord you are the temple of the holy ghost you're to give your all and surrender your all and everything that paul says first that i might win christ you know i just want to say let that be my motive lord let that be my objection let it be everything that consumes me oh do you feel that way church and say lord i want to lay down my desire and my ambition and that i might win christ i want to count everything else in my life as nothing that i might win christ let's all stand if you can come musicians stand to your feet with me that i might win christ let's all bow our heads here if you could lord jesus lord we come to this close of father what you've what you've said not what men have said lord but we've read your words today how applicable lord how relevant they are to our lives as many as i love i rebuke and chasten because we are sons if there was no rebuke if there was no chastisement do we help us to realize that lord that the absence of trial the absence of trouble the absence of of of calamity the absence of these things coming to our life would mean would spell disaster for us if we were to if you were to take it away lord it would as your word says it would it would the the son who doesn't isn't corrected is illegitimate but the the proof that we're your sons and we're your daughters is that you love us
