[30:33] right into the word of
[30:36] God this morning and I just you know
[30:42] um just
[30:44] been trying to make sure I find the
[30:46] exact mind of the Lord I've had this
[30:48] thought on my heart for quite some time
[30:52] actually and um just trying to figure
[30:57] out exactly what all the Lord wants to
[30:59] cover today I don't think we can get it
[31:01] all but we want to make sure we have
[31:03] exactly what the Lord wants I want to
[31:05] speak to you today on the last
[31:09] sermon of Jesus the Christ amen amen
[31:13] praise the Lord we're on the last day of
[31:15] the year amen so I thought and I didn't
[31:18] plan it that way honestly um I had
[31:21] probably several as you know I was
[31:23] finishing that series and I probably had
[31:25] more than half a dozen I did have well
[31:27] more than a half a dozen sermons
[31:29] simmering on the back burner amen and so
[31:32] when I saw the Lord bring this one to
[31:34] the Forefront I was I thought how ironic
[31:37] on the last day of the year I would
[31:39] preach the last sermon of Jesus the
[31:41] Christ amen praise the Lord Jeremiah
[31:44] chapter
[31:46] 30 amen we're going to uh sorry to leave

[34:13] know there's all kinds of people step up
[34:15] and claim Authority but there's really
[34:17] only one and I'm going to take three
[34:20] passages and I want you to notice who's
[34:22] really in charge all right verse one
[34:25] Jeremiah 30 and the the word that came
[34:28] to Jeremiah from the Lord
[34:31] saying thus speaketh the Lord God of
[34:34] Israel saying write thee all the words
[34:38] that I have spoken unto thee in a
[34:40] book for Lo the days come saith the Lord
[34:45] that I will I will bring again the
[34:48] Captivity of My People Israel in Judah
[34:51] sayeth the Lord and I will cause them to
[34:55] return to the land I will cause them to
[34:59] that I gave to their fathers and they
[35:02] shall possess it and these are the words
[35:07] that the Lord spake concerning Israel
[35:10] and concerning Judah for thus sayith the
[35:14] Lord we have heard a voice of trembling
[35:17] of fear and not of Peace ask you now and
[35:21] see whether a man doth travail with
[35:25] child wherefore do I see every man with
[35:29] his hands on his loins as a woman in
[35:32] travail and all faces are turned into
[35:37] paleness alas for that day is great so
[35:43] that none is like it it is even the time
[35:47] of Jacob's trouble but he shall be saved
[35:50] out of it that's quite an authoritative
[35:53] statement would you agree Jacob's
[35:55] trouble of course is the tribulation
[35:57] period Luke chapter
[36:00] 19 it's uh we call it the tribulation
[36:03] period and the Bible calls it the great
[36:04] day of tribulation but in there in the
[36:06] Old Testament it's referred to as the
[36:08] time of Jacob's
[36:12] trouble Luke chapter 19 just two verses
[36:16] there want to catch verse
[36:19] 26 and
[36:21] 27 now this of course is where a king
[36:26] went into to a far country to receive a
[36:28] kingdom and he left uh his servants in
[36:32] charg amen and when he went away the
[36:37] people the citizens sent a sent a
[36:40] message after him saying we will not
[36:42] have you or your servants to rule over
[36:45] us all right now let's catch it he comes
[36:48] back you know the story one had brought
[36:51] forth this meaning one had brought forth
[36:53] that meaning one had not brought forth
[36:55] any verse 20 six for I say unto you that
[36:59] unto everyone which hath shall be given
[37:04] and from him that hath not even that he
[37:08] hath shall be taken away from him but
[37:11] those mine enemies which would not that
[37:15] I should Reign Over them bring hither
[37:17] and slay them before
[37:20] me amen 1 Timothy chapter 6 and this
[37:25] will be uh the last last place that I I
[37:28] want to read amen praise the Lord first
[37:34] Timothy Paul's first pastoral letter
[37:37] after he writes lengthy letters to the
[37:41] Thessalonian church he writes to
[37:43] Timothy in chapter 6 and we're going to
[37:47] just catch verses 13 to
[37:55] 16 I give thee charge in the sight of
[37:58] God who quickeneth all things and before
[38:02] Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate
[38:06] witnessed a good
[38:08] confession that thou keep this
[38:10] commandment without spot unrebuked
[38:14] until the appearing of our Lord Jesus
[38:17] Christ which in his times he shall show
[38:22] who is the blessed and only potentate
[38:26] amen the king of kings and Lord of lords
[38:31] who only hath immortality dwelling in
[38:35] the light which no man can approach unto
[38:38] whom no man hath seen nor can see to
[38:41] whom be honor and power
[38:45] Everlasting amen let's
[38:48] pray father we commit ourselves into
[38:50] your hands now Lord and I pray that
[38:53] you'll just let My Heart Lord be led by
[38:56] the thee as we've looked much Lord at
[38:59] this thought trying to discern exactly
[39:02] the the the where the spirit is leading
[39:06] so now I I'm committed into your hands
[39:09] in Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[39:12] you can be
[39:25] seated
[39:42] amen praise the
[39:45] Lord don't know how far we'll get but
[39:48] we'll get as far as we can how's
[39:52] that yes I I greeted them in
[40:00] there
[40:01] is coming a day
[40:05] when Jesus
[40:07] will preach his last sermon to the
[40:11] masses amen and we're going to look at
[40:14] that just in a moment we won't we won't
[40:18] um go too far into it but I but I but I
[40:21] do want to just and you won't even have
[40:23] to turn and don't try to follow me Noah
[40:25] because I'm going to move quickly
[40:27] uh but we're going to refer to Matthew
[40:28] 25 just in a moment just as a
[40:31] reference and in fact is uh just just
[40:35] to uh all right no I've changed my mind
[40:38] already Matthew 25 amen praise the Lord
[40:41] I think I I think this would be a good
[40:43] idea for you to catch this and uh now
[40:46] that you're seated amen Matthew 25:31-46
[40:50] when the son of man shall come in his
[40:54] glory and all the angels with him then
[40:58] shall he sit upon the throne of his
[41:00] glory and before him shall be gathered
[41:03] all nations and he shall separate them
[41:06] one from another as a Shepherd divideth
[41:10] his sheep from the goats and he shall
[41:13] set the sheep on his right hand but the
[41:17] goats on the left now catch this 34th
[41:20] verse then shall the king
[41:24] say now I'm reading you you the text of
[41:28] the last sermon to the masses of Jesus
[41:33] Christ and I'm actually already have his
[41:35] sermon
[41:39] notes then shall the king say unto them
[41:41] on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my
[41:45] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[41:49] you from the foundation of the world for
[41:53] I was hungry and you gave me meat I was
[41:55] thirsty and you gave me drink I was a
[41:58] stranger and you took me in naked and
[42:00] you clothed me I was sick and you
[42:02] visited me I was in prison and you came
[42:05] unto me then shall the righteous answer
[42:08] him saying when Saul we thee hungry and
[42:11] fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink
[42:14] when saw we thee a stranger and took
[42:16] thee in or naked and clothed thee or
[42:18] when saw we thee sick or in prison and
[42:20] came unto thee and the King shall answer
[42:23] he's continuing on in his sermon now the
[42:26] king shall answer and say unto them
[42:29] verily I say unto you in as much as ye
[42:32] have done it unto one of the least of
[42:34] these my brethren ye have done it unto
[42:37] me then shall he say unto them on the
[42:40] left hand depart from me you cursed into
[42:44] Everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[42:47] and his angels I think it's a
[42:51] sad
[42:53] final judgment yeah on
[42:56] Humanity that ends up going to a place
[43:00] that was actually prepared for the devil
[43:02] and his
[43:03] angels and people who lament that God
[43:07] sends people to hell I'm glad a prophet
[43:09] cleared the air on that God doesn't send
[43:11] anybody to Hell men send themselves
[43:14] there hell was not created for humans
[43:18] and fact is Hell hath enlarged itself
[43:21] because it became an overcrowded prison
[43:24] it was never designed and built
[43:26] originally for humans it was built for
[43:28] the devil and his angels sadly people
[43:32] down through Millennia have allowed the
[43:35] devil to influence them just like those
[43:37] Fallen Angels did and now they're headed
[43:40] to the same
[43:42] place amen prepared for the devil and
[43:48] his
[43:48] angels for I was hungry and you gave me
[43:51] no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no
[43:53] drink I was a stranger took me not in
[43:55] naked you clothed me me not sick and in
[43:57] prison and you visited me not then shall
[44:00] they also answer him saying Lord when
[44:01] saw we thee hungry or thirst or a
[44:04] stranger or naked or sick or in prison
[44:06] and did not Minister unto thee then
[44:08] shall he answer them saying verily I say
[44:11] unto you in as much as you did it not to
[44:14] one of the least of these you did it not
[44:16] to me proving that those who are the
[44:20] family of God who house the word of God
[44:24] that when the enemy bothers you he's
[44:27] bothering God Amen praise the Lord and
[44:31] these shall go away into Everlasting
[44:34] punishment but the righteous into life
[44:36] eternal now this of course is at the end
[44:39] of the great uh it's at the end of the
[44:42] tribulation it's at the end of the
[44:44] Thousand-Year Millennium this is this is
[44:47] why I called it the last sermon of Jesus
[44:51] the Christ it's the last time he's going
[44:54] to preach to the masses and we we
[44:57] realize that on that day when he begins
[45:00] to announce his judgment and and all of
[45:03] his judgments are are pure all of his
[45:07] words are true all of his ways are
[45:11] just there's nobody you know you you
[45:13] first have uh the the iniquitous people
[45:20] who rise up and say wait a minute hold
[45:23] on did not we preach in thy name and do
[45:26] all kinds of things in thy name and
[45:29] that's when Jesus will say depart from
[45:31] me you worker of iniquity I never knew
[45:34] you now it's interesting that they that
[45:37] they try to claim to say hey we did all
[45:41] of these works in your name we we we we
[45:45] acted like Christians we went to church
[45:48] like Christians we read bibles like
[45:50] Christians yeah but he will say yes but
[45:54] you did it but your heart was always
[45:57] evil you it was never it was never in
[46:00] your heart to do that you say well then
[46:03] how would they have such an audacity to
[46:06] stand in front of the judge of all men's
[46:08] hearts and try to claim such a technical
[46:12] take such a a legal argument uh and I
[46:16] will tell you why they do it then
[46:19] because that's what they do now and
[46:22] they've been used to doing that they've
[46:24] been used to just joining a church and
[46:26] everybody think they're a Christian
[46:28] they've been used to just quoting out of
[46:30] the Bible or singing gospel songs and
[46:33] pretending to be something they weren't
[46:36] and everybody went along with
[46:38] it so now they're coming forward they're
[46:42] all they're doing is what they've always
[46:44] tried to do and they've got by with it
[46:46] but nobody is going to escape this judge
[46:50] nobody is going to get by with a
[46:54] insincere confession of Christ those
[46:57] days here are done that's it there's
[47:00] nobody going to make that claim and in
[47:02] in in perfect contradistinction you have
[47:05] the unwise Virgin and and the different
[47:08] ones who of a pure heart who may be who
[47:11] may be never did the works or the
[47:13] exploits of all of these people who
[47:16] build all of their big worldwide
[47:18] iniquitous Ministries but yet in their
[47:21] heart they observe good and in their
[47:24] heart as best they could they were
[47:26] righteous people and the Bible calls
[47:28] them righteous the righteous shall shall
[47:30] say to the king this isn't the bride the
[47:33] bride are on the
[47:35] throne the bride aren't being judged
[47:37] we're already judged now we're already
[47:39] standing before the Judgment seat of God
[47:42] of Christ and we're being judged now by
[47:44] the word I don't want to go there and be
[47:46] judged then I'll take it right here and
[47:48] right
[47:50] now but we find that the righteous shall
[47:53] say to the king and the King shall say
[47:55] to the righteous and that and then in
[47:57] the Book of Revelation they're actually
[47:59] called
[48:00] saints Saints means Sanctified one amen
[48:04] so it's not going to do you any good uh
[48:07] to to try to be in a church or call
[48:10] yourself a Christian if you're not even
[48:12] going to allow common decency and
[48:15] sanctification to work in your life I'm
[48:18] sorry those people by the billions are
[48:21] going to
[48:22] perish but I'm glad that Jesus you know
[48:26] looks beyond just his elected family
[48:28] just his elected bride and Jesus would
[48:31] say blessed are the merciful for they
[48:33] shall obtain Mercy blessed are the meek
[48:35] and and and they shall inherit the earth
[48:37] so God is Not unaware and I'm glad he's
[48:41] the Arbiter of every man's heart I'm so
[48:43] glad that I don't have to figure all
[48:45] that out all I got to do is work out my
[48:48] salvation with fear and trembling in his
[48:50] presence all I my job is to preach the
[48:53] gospel to tell you to p a token your
[48:56] home I'm here to tell you God will
[48:58] figure it all
[49:02] out I'm so glad that I don't have to
[49:04] determine
[49:06] that we'd get it wrong we surely
[49:10] would so there's coming this day when
[49:13] Jesus will preach his last sermon to the
[49:16] masses and this will certainly be the
[49:19] largest audience of all time it will
[49:23] literally be the audience of all time
[49:26] amen and on that day he's going to prove
[49:30] beyond all doubt that he is first of all
[49:34] very
[49:35] real and all the critics who said he
[49:38] wasn't real are they ever going to get a
[49:41] surprise he's going to prove that he's
[49:44] not only very real but that he alone is
[49:47] the only
[49:49] being that has real
[49:52] unlimited power moreover it's it's going
[49:55] to become clear that that that no matter
[49:58] really what has happened down through
[50:01] history that really that he had all
[50:04] power and was always in control was
[50:06] always
[50:07] true and it's going to become clear that
[50:09] he alone will have the final say I'm
[50:13] glad to know that my future goes on from
[50:16] that sermon I'm glad to know that my
[50:19] life is not ending at that time I'm glad
[50:21] to know that my future is clear and that
[50:24] my future is bright
[50:28] brother brandham was told this he
[50:30] worried about his ministry and worried
[50:32] about his life and worried about his
[50:34] mistakes boy we do that don't we and
[50:37] he's coming to God and he had made a
[50:39] mistake and he had disobeyed the Lord
[50:42] amen do we do that and he's got the
[50:46] question that we have often had for our
[50:48] own selves and because we've also made
[50:51] mistakes and we've also missed
[50:53] opportunities and brother bradam did
[50:54] both missed a great opportunity and as
[50:57] great as his Africa campaign was how
[51:00] much greater it would have been had he
[51:02] obeyed the Lord and how much less how
[51:04] how he would not have had to suffer had
[51:06] he not let preachers take him aside and
[51:10] and we've had that we've come to God in
[51:12] Repentance and say Lord I'm so sorry I
[51:15] did the wrong thing I I knew you were
[51:16] telling me different and I did it anyway
[51:18] please forgive me I'm glad I'm hearing
[51:20] the same message your future is
[51:24] clear
[51:27] my future is clear your future is clear
[51:30] I say it all the time our future is
[51:32] bright friends when that when that when
[51:35] that trial is over when that last sermon
[51:40] of Jesus the Christ is preached to the
[51:42] masses and he separates the sheep from
[51:46] the he separates the good from the bad
[51:48] as a Shepherd would separate sheep from
[51:50] goats and I you know and and and and
[51:53] those who are cast into to uh
[51:56] destruction with the devil and his
[51:58] angels I I'm glad that 10,000 years will
[52:02] just be started
[52:04] am I love that old song I woke up this
[52:07] morning had to play it and I at 10,000
[52:10] Years the song says we have just begun
[52:13] the battle will be over and the Victory
[52:16] will be won 10,000
[52:19] years and we will have just
[52:22] begun I just say today take courage
[52:25] friends let come what may let the
[52:27] Heathen rage the Heathen will always
[52:29] rage 10,000
[52:32] years I'll still be going
[52:37] strong when Jesus preached his second to
[52:41] last sermon to the
[52:43] masses I'm talking about to the masses
[52:46] he preached all through his ministry
[52:47] three and a half
[52:49] years uh on a Roman Calendar three years
[52:53] on a Jewish calendar
[52:55] and he he preached you know on the the
[52:58] Mount of Olives he preached in the
[53:00] temple he preached in the porch area he
[53:03] he preached in homes he preached in
[53:05] synagogues crowd here crowd there
[53:07] sometimes the crowds were so much so
[53:10] that he had to get in a boat and push
[53:12] off a little bit because they filled the
[53:14] bank but but that's that's not like when
[53:19] he descended into the lower parts of the
[53:22] earth
[53:23] amen this was like the great white
[53:26] Throne judgment that we read about in in
[53:29] Matthew
[53:30] 25 we're going to find
[53:33] that that's his last sermon to the
[53:37] masses his second to last sermon to the
[53:40] masses is when he descended into the
[53:42] lower parts of the earth to preach to
[53:45] souls in
[53:47] prison Bible declares that that he that
[53:50] ascended is the same that first he that
[53:53] ascended first descended into the lower
[53:56] parts of the Earth the Bible says he
[53:58] preached to those souls in prison who
[54:00] repented not in the days of Noah I want
[54:04] to tell you something never never was it
[54:07] more
[54:08] true at that moment that he spoke to a
[54:11] captive
[54:13] audience a captive audience and and and
[54:17] and at that moment people who had not
[54:19] repented from the time of of Cain all
[54:23] the way back who who arrogantly decided
[54:26] to go his own way and reject God's mercy
[54:29] in his word God's Mercy is always in his
[54:32] word it's always where you find
[54:35] it and it it went on from Cain and you
[54:38] can see it in his descendants and Cain
[54:40] is you know he put a mark and anybody
[54:43] that destroys him will be destroyed and
[54:46] and then you go on through his lineage
[54:49] and you come to the fourth chapter of
[54:50] Genesis and you find lch now there's you
[54:53] know Cain chose you see those names you
[54:56] see Enoch and limi on on Cain's side and
[54:58] then Enoch and all of these on on uh
[55:01] Seth's side that's just because
[55:03] civilization was just beginning to
[55:05] burgeon through the Earth and you find
[55:08] that this descendant of Cain a direct
[55:10] descendant of Cain in Genesis 423 and 24
[55:13] we're not going to read it today but you
[55:15] know the problem was was his arrogance
[55:18] you know all the because he said you
[55:21] know if if this is what happened to Cain
[55:24] you know then then seven times I uh
[55:26] seven times upon me and the problem was
[55:29] not what he had done he had actually
[55:30] killed a man to his wounding meaning was
[55:33] killed him in self-defense a young man
[55:34] tried to kill him and he defended
[55:36] himself that wasn't the problem God I
[55:39] don't think would have condemned him for
[55:40] defending his life but that he boasted
[55:42] about it that he was arrogant about it
[55:45] that it was still that same Defiance I
[55:47] did it my way I'm going to live my life
[55:50] and nobody's going to tell me what to do
[55:52] with my life what I'd like to know is
[55:54] who told you it was your
[55:56] life did you give it to yourself can you
[55:59] keep it that can you keep the air in
[56:01] your lungs right now if it wasn't for
[56:03] God no wonder the Bible says let
[56:06] everything that has breath praise the
[56:08] Lord old ma Jackson used to always say
[56:11] if you're not going to praise him stop
[56:14] breathing because you're breathing his
[56:16] air that he gives you I'm here to tell
[56:18] you something friends we ought to praise
[56:20] the
[56:21] Lord
[56:23] hallelujah
[56:30] so here Jesus goes down and he descends
[56:33] into the lower parts of the earth he's
[56:36] preaching to all those from Cain to lmch
[56:39] and all the way up through to the days
[56:41] of Noah and even
[56:43] Beyond those who repented not and and
[56:47] the sad part to me about that verse is
[56:50] those who repented not in the
[56:51] longsuffering
[56:53] days God God started pronouncing
[56:56] judgment on the world but he waited and
[57:00] kept Noah preaching for 120
[57:04] years my goodness you're talking about a
[57:06] god rich in
[57:08] Mercy to pre to have him preach for 120
[57:11] years and and and and and here he is now
[57:15] and then not only those but those who
[57:17] were lodged on the sides of the pit that
[57:20] Isaiah and Ezekiel spoke of Isaiah when
[57:24] he discerned the heart of Lucifer how
[57:26] that Lucifer you remember in Isaiah 14
[57:29] Lucifer his desire was to ascend above
[57:32] the
[57:33] Stars which was the sons of God was the
[57:36] family of God don't don't lose sight of
[57:38] it that God that Satan wants to have a
[57:43] position higher than
[57:45] you don't lose sight of that now he now
[57:49] there's he can't climb higher than you
[57:52] so what he does is he tries to pull you
[57:55] lower than him don't let
[57:59] him resist the devil submit yourself to
[58:03] God resist the enemy and he will flee
[58:05] from you
[58:08] Hallelujah see so he says I will Ascend
[58:12] above the heights of the clouds I will
[58:14] be like the most
[58:15] high Isaiah says Isaiah gives him a
[58:19] reality check says yet Thou shalt be
[58:22] brought down to Hell
[58:25] to the sides of the
[58:27] pit Jesus was preaching to those who
[58:31] were lodged on the sides of the pit
[58:34] Ezekiel Saw it in Ezekiel 32 the strong
[58:37] among the mighty shall speak to him out
[58:39] of the midst of hell with them that help
[58:42] him they are gone down no go ahead and
[58:45] give me Ezekiel
[58:47] 3221 to 23 I think I'd like to read that
[58:50] I'd like to have you read it with me
[58:52] Ezekiel
[58:53] 32 21 one the strong among the mighty
[58:58] shall speak to him out of the midst of
[59:01] hell with them that help him they are
[59:04] gone down they lie uncircumcised slain
[59:08] By The Sword Asher is there and all her
[59:12] company his graves are about him all of
[59:15] them slain Fallen By The Sword whose
[59:18] graves are set in the sides of the pit
[59:22] and her company is round about her grave
[59:24] all of them slain Fallen By The Sword
[59:28] which caused Terror in the land of the
[59:32] living amen why brother brandom said
[59:34] don't ever let anyone tell you the
[59:36] devil's not real right don't ever let
[59:39] anyone tell you hell is not a real place
[59:42] it's real and open for business
[59:45] now amen Jesus went there and preached
[59:48] to souls in prison captive audience who
[59:51] had no chance to get out because they
[59:53] repented not when God was
[59:57] longsuffering
[59:58] amen people who wouldn't hear his
[1:00:04] servants though he sent them continually
[1:00:06] they killed his servants
[1:00:09] actually people who wouldn't come to
[1:00:13] church people who would walk out while
[1:00:17] the word was being preached come on
[1:00:20] here's something they didn't like and
[1:00:22] turn around and and and and and and I
[1:00:24] remember a testimony I forget the
[1:00:27] sister's name elderly
[1:00:29] sister was there I believe I believe it
[1:00:31] was in choosing of a bride I'm pretty
[1:00:34] sure if that might stand correction I
[1:00:36] believe it was choosing of a bride and
[1:00:40] um and and at the end you you can hear
[1:00:42] Brother R becomes very emotional you
[1:00:44] know he's warning Hollywood you know
[1:00:47] repent Los Angeles and your honeycomb is
[1:00:50] right under you and he's crying out
[1:00:53] there and uh and and and and we we find
[1:00:57] that he had really been hard on on how
[1:01:00] people dress and and he had really went
[1:01:03] after you know women with high heeled
[1:01:05] shoes and he went to the scripture and
[1:01:08] pointed out that this the Bible talks
[1:01:10] about in the last days that women would
[1:01:12] mince as they
[1:01:14] walk clearly showing that their their
[1:01:17] high heels are so high they're they're
[1:01:19] walking funny and and and the way high
[1:01:21] heels cause a woman's figure to be
[1:01:23] accentuated and it's all done on purpose
[1:01:25] amen and it wasn't just the women it was
[1:01:28] men and different things and and and
[1:01:30] that's why I said you know even the
[1:01:32] foolish virgin were sanctified people
[1:01:35] see so so we find that that they when
[1:01:39] you can hear all the people screaming
[1:01:41] and crying in a pandemonium the
[1:01:43] anointing is there so strong and this
[1:01:46] sister h a minister asked her what were
[1:01:49] the people doing we can hear all of the
[1:01:50] commotion she said half the audience was
[1:01:53] on their face crying out to God in
[1:01:56] Repentance and the other half had got up
[1:01:59] spun around and clicky clacked their
[1:02:01] high heels right out the
[1:02:03] door they didn't want to hear that kind
[1:02:05] of word I I recently preached a funeral
[1:02:08] first time it's ever happened to me in
[1:02:10] my entire in 35 years of preaching
[1:02:12] funerals I'd always said that I one of
[1:02:15] the things I like about preaching
[1:02:16] funerals is you can say whatever you
[1:02:18] want nobody walk out cuz it's a
[1:02:20] funeral that's the
[1:02:22] truth and and and I just preach a
[1:02:24] funeral broke my 35 year record and I'm
[1:02:28] not all I'm doing is talking about
[1:02:30] something so glorious something so
[1:02:33] wonderful that a prophet gave an
[1:02:35] assurance to mothers with wayward
[1:02:37] children and said that wayward child
[1:02:39] said all right here's what you do sister
[1:02:42] you claim them you take the same faith
[1:02:45] that you believe for yourself and you
[1:02:47] claim that child and said and don't you
[1:02:49] and you claim it and said and if you
[1:02:52] never see it and you go to your grave
[1:02:55] and you never see it on the resurrection
[1:02:58] when you come up that faith will still
[1:03:00] be burning in your heart CU you come up
[1:03:02] like you went
[1:03:04] down and he said and at that time God
[1:03:07] will have to answer to that faith and he
[1:03:09] cannot lie and he'll have to bring them
[1:03:11] in what a glorious
[1:03:15] promise can you imagine that that would
[1:03:17] make somebody so angry that they would
[1:03:20] jump off the front row and try to Barrel
[1:03:22] out the side door and make a scene
[1:03:24] unfortunately the Lord locked the door
[1:03:25] and they couldn't get out and embarrass
[1:03:28] themselves kicked at it and Shook at it
[1:03:31] and banged on it and finally sat down
[1:03:34] red in the
[1:03:36] face oh
[1:03:38] my I'm G to tell you something friend
[1:03:40] there going to be a lot of embarrassed
[1:03:42] people on the day of

[1:03:50] read about in Matthew
[1:03:52] 24 I'll promise you
[1:03:55] that nobody's going to walk out on that
[1:03:58] sermon they'll hear that sermon till the
[1:04:00] last word when you get a convicted felon
[1:04:03] who's already convicted you ever notied
[1:04:05] that they stand up very respectfully to
[1:04:07] to hear their sentence you know why they
[1:04:09] do that because they know that the judge
[1:04:12] just might have a little bit of Mercy on
[1:04:15] them they're already convicted they're
[1:04:17] definitely going to prison but but the
[1:04:19] judge hasn't yet sentenced them and so
[1:04:21] they stand up and they're they're
[1:04:23] terrible person but they're very
[1:04:25] respectful because they want to see if
[1:04:27] maybe just maybe he'll have a little bit
[1:04:29] of Mercy I'm here to tell you something
[1:04:31] friends these people are going to stand
[1:04:33] at attention they won't walk out of that
[1:04:36] sermon there ain't nowhere to walk
[1:04:39] to
[1:04:41] Hallelujah they'll stand there till the
[1:04:44] last
[1:04:48] minute the ministry of the
[1:04:51] Lamb that we see in the life Liv of the
[1:04:54] people will go all the way down to the
[1:04:57] last days don't ever lose sight of the
[1:04:59] fact that your life itself is a sermon
[1:05:03] to the world
[1:05:05] Amen Satan had made his boast that he
[1:05:09] would ascended above the family of
[1:05:13] God but I'm I'm going to tell you
[1:05:15] something
[1:05:16] friends I've thought about this and the
[1:05:19] imagery has been in my mind since I was
[1:05:21] a very young man started
[1:05:23] preaching I just see that day when Jesus
[1:05:27] preaches his last sermon to the
[1:05:30] masses and when the and the Bible and I
[1:05:32] could go into all kinds of different
[1:05:34] scriptures that that talks about how
[1:05:36] that his enemies shall be brought before
[1:05:38] the son and they shall be slain in his
[1:05:40] presence there are scriptures that talk
[1:05:42] about Satan being brought forward and
[1:05:45] the people shall narrowly look upon him
[1:05:47] we could have read it in some of the
[1:05:49] things we read and how that they will
[1:05:51] even be astonished is this the man
[1:05:54] that caused Nations to
[1:05:56] tremble are you mean I fell for this guy
[1:06:01] and now I'm doomed cuz I listened to
[1:06:04] him and I rejected the King on his
[1:06:08] throne oh friends it it makes me shiver
[1:06:13] to think but I I can just see I can see
[1:06:16] in my mind's eye I can see Christ I read
[1:06:18] you some of his sermon material already
[1:06:21] oh it's going to be a a sad day for the
[1:06:24] unbeliever but a happy day for those who
[1:06:26] stayed humble before the Lord that's
[1:06:30] when he steps off of his throne before
[1:06:32] Satan is carried away this is my own
[1:06:35] license but I just see Christ one last
[1:06:38] time saying Lucifer you see this bride
[1:06:41] seated with me on this throne and you
[1:06:44] said you would Ascend above her that's
[1:06:47] not going to
[1:06:49] happen you said you would be like me
[1:06:51] that's not going to happen I let you
[1:06:55] have it all satan I let you have the
[1:06:57] government I let you have the education
[1:06:59] I let you have science I let you have
[1:07:01] entertainment I let you have pull pits I
[1:07:04] let you have families and when you were
[1:07:06] at your Zenith I took my word and I
[1:07:10] perfected my bride right under your
[1:07:14] nose I didn't sucker punch you I didn't
[1:07:17] catch you looking away I didn't wait for
[1:07:19] you to be in a weak moment when my bride
[1:07:22] was weak then I was strong and I have
[1:07:25] perfected her
[1:07:27] today I'm so happy to be a part of that
[1:07:30] number friends are you happy to be a
[1:07:32] part of that
[1:07:33] number hallelujah oh
[1:07:37] my Satan had made his
[1:07:39] boast he's always bragging he's always
[1:07:44] boasting oh I can hear him
[1:07:46] declaring you know Christ declaring how
[1:07:50] that he was always in control of his
[1:07:52] bride he allowed Satan to afflict
[1:07:56] them sure he allowed it he allowed Satan
[1:08:01] to afflict them with Oh my he Afflicted
[1:08:04] them with persecutions and and sickness
[1:08:09] and and I I mean Cancers and
[1:08:13] tuberculosis and all kinds of diseases
[1:08:17] and crippling and some of them God
[1:08:21] healed you know why you know why think
[1:08:24] God healed some of
[1:08:26] them to show Satan you don't
[1:08:31] matter and then others as the Bible says
[1:08:34] others he allowed to have cruel cruel
[1:08:37] mockings and he allowed them to go down
[1:08:39] and and they even refused Deliverance of
[1:08:41] of whom the Paul says the world was not
[1:08:44] even worthy think of a life that the
[1:08:47] world isn't even worthy of friends oh my
[1:08:50] he's not talking about Perfect People
[1:08:51] he's talking about people who had
[1:08:53] perfect fath fath in a perfect God
[1:08:56] hallelujah I don't claim to be a a
[1:08:59] perfect person but my faith in his word
[1:09:01] is perfect that's the faith of Abraham
[1:09:04] not that Abraham wasn't a perfect person
[1:09:06] Abraham made mistakes the Bible doesn't
[1:09:09] say Abraham never stumbled the Bible
[1:09:12] says Abraham never stumbled at the
[1:09:15] promise it didn't matter what mistakes
[1:09:17] he made he just kept going forward with
[1:09:20] the
[1:09:22] promise
[1:09:24] oh my goodness some of them he some of
[1:09:28] them he allowed to go through tragedy
[1:09:31] some of them he allowed to go through
[1:09:32] sickness some of them he allowed to go
[1:09:34] through suffering and then you know what
[1:09:36] he did he let Satan torment him and make
[1:09:39] him suffer and have tragedy and then he
[1:09:41] snatched them and brought him home you
[1:09:44] know why he did that you know why he let
[1:09:46] him die under that cancer under that
[1:09:48] tuberculosis or under that Co you know
[1:09:50] why he did that to show Satan again you
[1:09:53] don't matter I can still bring him
[1:09:57] home he doesn't matter friends he
[1:09:59] doesn't matter he he runs nothing in the
[1:10:02] kingdom of God hallelujah I know my
[1:10:05] redeemer
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:11] liveth The Sinner arrived at his at his
[1:10:14] judgment
[1:10:16] bar by a refusal to have the
[1:10:20] word rule over his life amen
[1:10:26] many even after being given opportunity
[1:10:29] to
[1:10:30] serve serve God uh chose as did Judas to
[1:10:37] betray the word and join the I call them
[1:10:40] the going going gone
[1:10:42] crowd they're going to go out of
[1:10:45] existence let them rage all they want
[1:10:47] let them jump up and down turn blue in
[1:10:49] the face I don't care they're part of
[1:10:51] the going going gone crowd
[1:10:55] Hallelujah he warned them we read it in
[1:10:58] Jeremiah 30 we we we you know he talks
[1:11:01] about in 1 Thessalonians 2:4 he said how
[1:11:05] that they they killed the Lord Jesus and
[1:11:07] they killed their own prophets and they
[1:11:09] persecute us and they Paul talks about
[1:11:12] to the Thessalonian Church they even
[1:11:13] forbid us to speak can you imagine I
[1:11:15] mean it's bad enough that you reject the
[1:11:18] word of God and then try to get somebody
[1:11:20] else to stop preaching it amen my
[1:11:23] goodness I mean how what kind of
[1:11:25] insanity is that and I it's fine if it's
[1:11:28] not for you then go on live in peace do
[1:11:32] all you can be all you can this is all
[1:11:34] you'll ever have God bless you carry on
[1:11:37] see brother brandham even talks about
[1:11:38] it's right on tape said people with
[1:11:40] their cigarettes and their alcohol
[1:11:42] brother said don't take that from them
[1:11:44] that's the only happiness they'll ever
[1:11:46] know amen see I'm not trying to reform
[1:11:48] people I'm trying to get them the
[1:11:50] gospel see that that's all they'll ever
[1:11:53] have and and and so you know I'm trying
[1:11:56] to persuade them to give their heart to
[1:11:58] Christ and then they won't have to
[1:11:59] preach about cigarettes and booze the
[1:12:02] Holy Ghost cleans up lives I don't have
[1:12:04] to stand up here and and and take it in
[1:12:07] that direction see of course there's
[1:12:09] nothing wrong with gun barrel preaching
[1:12:11] I get it so so we find then that that
[1:12:16] they they this increasing Madness that
[1:12:19] that is I think we could fairly say is
[1:12:21] infecting the minds of all Humanity
[1:12:24] and it was prophesied that the whole
[1:12:28] world whose names are not in the book of
[1:12:30] life would take the mark of the beast
[1:12:32] whose names are not written in the Book
[1:12:34] of Life of the lamb slain before the
[1:12:36] foundation of the world all of them will
[1:12:39] worship the Beast although it seems
[1:12:40] impossible that that would happen
[1:12:43] because when you when the description of
[1:12:45] the Beast is so clear and what he'll do
[1:12:47] and what he'll be you think ahead and
[1:12:50] you go nobody would fall for that but
[1:12:53] they
[1:12:54] will and the reason they will then is
[1:12:57] because they're already being drawn in
[1:12:59] condition now see by by the by the
[1:13:03] things of the world the Bible doesn't
[1:13:05] call it Jacob's trouble for nothing it's
[1:13:08] it's kind it it's called a tribulation
[1:13:11] period and you know the the Bible
[1:13:14] declares that that it'll be a day like
[1:13:17] has never been and will never be again
[1:13:19] those aren't Idle
[1:13:21] Words those are not idle words
[1:13:25] words in the end you know to be and I
[1:13:29] guess for me this is always the most
[1:13:31] heartbreaking part this is the part
[1:13:33] where I see weeping and wailing and
[1:13:35] nashing of
[1:13:36] teeth in its greatest
[1:13:40] fulfillment is that they
[1:13:43] will for a brief time be able to see
[1:13:48] what they've missed out
[1:13:50] on it's it to me
[1:13:54] when they see the bride on the throne
[1:13:57] and when they see the king and when they
[1:14:00] have their life played back and they can
[1:14:02] see that they had opportunity after
[1:14:04] opportunity after opportunity and God gr
[1:14:08] was willing to even grade them on a
[1:14:10] curve they even if they couldn't see the
[1:14:12] message of the hour if they'd just be a
[1:14:14] Sanctified
[1:14:15] person that's all that he may he'd find
[1:14:18] a way he even he even offered Cain all
[1:14:21] you got to do is act like your brother
[1:14:23] off find a way for you am and when they
[1:14:26] stand there and they they saw the
[1:14:28] example of the true word of God and to
[1:14:31] realize that they they destroyed their
[1:14:33] own self because they wouldn't accept it
[1:14:36] amen and and then not only that but then
[1:14:38] to see what the bride because he in
[1:14:41] their presence he says to the even the
[1:14:44] foolish virgin enter into the joys of
[1:14:46] the Lord prepared for you before the
[1:14:49] foundation of the world and they going
[1:14:50] to have to stand there and see that
[1:14:53] to me that's the most horrible part I
[1:14:56] I've talked about you know the a
[1:14:58] horrible part about you know in a in a
[1:15:01] sermon I preached years ago leaders die
[1:15:03] last and because and that was just taken
[1:15:06] from the principle of the Book of Joshua
[1:15:08] where they they go to army they go to
[1:15:11] war with five Kings and when they're
[1:15:13] fighting the five kings run into a cave
[1:15:15] and hide and then Israel you know routes
[1:15:17] the enemy and and God gives them great
[1:15:20] Victory and they come to Joshua and they
[1:15:22] say we got the Kings trapped in a cave
[1:15:24] they went in there and Joshua says all
[1:15:27] right listen just just block it up put
[1:15:29] stones in front of it so they can't
[1:15:30] escape go ahead and finish the war go
[1:15:33] ahead and finish the battle kill all the
[1:15:35] enemy and uh and even God come down and
[1:15:38] helped them and killed more than they
[1:15:39] killed yeah God stoned them from Heaven
[1:15:43] amen and he said then we'll come back
[1:15:45] and deal with these leaders because
[1:15:46] leaders get killed last see and so so I
[1:15:50] I I was showing just showing how that
[1:15:52] you know brother Bram talks about Elvis
[1:15:54] Presley and all the millions of young
[1:15:56] teenagers that he sent helped send to
[1:15:58] the Lake of Fire leaders in this world
[1:16:01] great leaders who think they have all
[1:16:03] this power and great political power and
[1:16:05] great economic power and the Brain Trust
[1:16:08] of the world and and they're going to be
[1:16:10] the ones responsible for Armageddon
[1:16:14] yes yes that's the madness that they're
[1:16:17] literally going they're so the insanity
[1:16:20] is going to and it's already merging now
[1:16:22] it's already happening now I I'm here to
[1:16:25] tell you something friends there is
[1:16:27] there is change coming there I brother
[1:16:30] Mark and I were we were sharing this
[1:16:32] this thing that we uh together uh on on
[1:16:36] technology and on AI and different
[1:16:37] things like that and I'm not here to
[1:16:38] preach with science lesson but I'm just
[1:16:40] here to tell you that that even the
[1:16:42] experts are they know that they're
[1:16:45] headed for Destruction but they but
[1:16:48] everybody's got to be the first one so
[1:16:50] everybody just got I know we're killing
[1:16:51] ourselves but I can't get beat
[1:16:54] feet and that's the insanity and it's
[1:16:56] and the Bible tells me say oh you're
[1:16:58] Doom and Gloom I'm not I'm just a Bible
[1:17:01] reader and I know that they come and
[1:17:03] destroy themselves God doesn't destroy
[1:17:05] the world God loves The World God loves
[1:17:09] life he doesn't even he doesn't even
[1:17:11] take pleasure in the death of The Sinner
[1:17:12] he would let all men come to repentance
[1:17:15] mankind is going to destroy himself say
[1:17:18] why because he's determined to am I'm so
[1:17:22] glad I got a different kind of a mind
[1:17:24] I'm so glad something came into my heart
[1:17:27] and I said I'm not of this world this
[1:17:28] world is not my
[1:17:30] home Hallelujah I got another one
[1:17:34] coming
[1:17:36] amen Jacob's
[1:17:38] trouble and that they will have to you
[1:17:41] know and and so for for every
[1:17:45] leader for every parent who pushed their
[1:17:49] innocent children into Beauty pageants
[1:17:53] and talent shows and get on there and
[1:17:57] win the big title America's got this and
[1:18:00] Britain's got this and every country's
[1:18:02] got their this now and parents literally
[1:18:06] literally prostituting their children to
[1:18:09] make them famous in the world I'm here
[1:18:11] to tell you when those children are
[1:18:14] being led to the Lake of Fire Mom and
[1:18:16] Dad will have to back up because leaders
[1:18:19] die
[1:18:21] last and you're going to stand there and
[1:18:24] you're going to hear the screams of that
[1:18:26] child this isn't a fairy tale or a
[1:18:29] horror story this is
[1:18:31] real this what the Bible foretells and
[1:18:34] they're going to have to stand there and
[1:18:35] hear the screams of their children as
[1:18:38] they're cast in Elvis will have to stand
[1:18:40] there and hear the screams uh presidents
[1:18:43] will have to stand and hear the screams
[1:18:45] of the
[1:18:48] people leaders die
[1:18:51] last
[1:18:58] and how they have to stand
[1:19:00] there and
[1:19:02] see what they missed out
[1:19:04] on to see the
[1:19:07] eternities to see that bright new world
[1:19:10] to see the king ready to get on with it
[1:19:14] and all that's doing is he's just
[1:19:16] eliminating all just like we read in
[1:19:18] Jeremiah he's eliminating he's
[1:19:20] establishing his family which he was
[1:19:22] always going to do
[1:19:24] matter what anybody did that was always
[1:19:25] going to end that way he gave everybody
[1:19:28] an an opportunity everybody got a fair
[1:19:30] Square chance everybody gets a fair
[1:19:33] trial no that's why I've said in Matthew
[1:19:36] 25 go to Matthew 25 read all through it
[1:19:39] go go to the Book of Revelation go into
[1:19:41] 181 19 20 21 read all through there read
[1:19:44] read what happens in 19 and 20 you don't
[1:19:47] find anybody carrying signs or
[1:19:49] marching you don't find anybody crying
[1:19:52] foul or in Injustice right because
[1:19:55] there's a knowing at that point that
[1:19:56] everybody standing there in the presence
[1:19:58] of that judge knows very well that they
[1:20:01] are
[1:20:02] guilty and everybody goes to their fate
[1:20:04] not kicking and
[1:20:06] screaming but with their head
[1:20:08] bowed and to see what they're going to
[1:20:11] miss out on to me that to me that's the
[1:20:16] that's the gritting of the teeth that's
[1:20:18] the because when when something is so
[1:20:21] bitter when when a disappointment is so
[1:20:24] bitter that it you just grind your teeth
[1:20:27] over it and people just agonize and one
[1:20:31] of the greatest agonies is what it
[1:20:34] didn't what could have been that I I
[1:20:37] lost it all and it need not have been I
[1:20:39] didn't have to lose it all I could have
[1:20:42] gained it all and it's not my fate I I'm
[1:20:44] here to tell you you know you you can
[1:20:46] say what you want and condemn me if you
[1:20:48] want but to me I think the Lake of Fire
[1:20:51] that'll finally take them out of
[1:20:53] existence will be
[1:20:54] Mercy to know that to know that I could
[1:20:57] have had that and I missed out on it
[1:20:59] because I wanted my own way oh friends
[1:21:03] the the gospel comes with Mercy to you
[1:21:05] today don't leave this building without
[1:21:08] the mercy of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:10] Christ he calls to you from a from a
[1:21:13] heart that loves you and wants to give
[1:21:16] you a new life and give you a new world
[1:21:19] and save you from
[1:21:21] destruction he's not evil God he's a
[1:21:23] loving God it's the devil trying to kill
[1:21:26] you it's the devil trying to destroy you
[1:21:29] it's the devil that hates
[1:21:33] you to be gone forever and miss out on
[1:21:36] the grandest purpose of
[1:21:39] life oh my when everything is stripped
[1:21:42] away as I said here
[1:21:44] recently and there's only remaining pure
[1:21:47] life I'm looking forward to that
[1:21:49] friends I'm so looking forward to that
[1:21:59] Amen brother randam says in the message
[1:22:02] Investments and I'm going to turn a
[1:22:05] corner here and make a run for the
[1:22:06] Finish
[1:22:09] Line in Investments it's a good
[1:22:12] sermon
[1:22:14] Investments you want to make sure you're
[1:22:16] investing in the right
[1:22:18] thing he says that's where people have
[1:22:21] got to we
[1:22:23] we've joined Church which is all right
[1:22:25] we do those things but you say are you a
[1:22:27] Christian I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist
[1:22:29] I'm a presbyterian Pentecost or
[1:22:30] something it's just a tradition there's
[1:22:33] no entering in sincerity anymore they
[1:22:36] won't move up cope with the scriptures
[1:22:38] and things they just live any way they
[1:22:40] want to if they got a pastor tries to
[1:22:42] correct them they out him they have
[1:22:44] nothing to do with him if he can't bring
[1:22:46] Hollywood in the church parties bonco
[1:22:48] parties soup suppers and everything else
[1:22:51] now you know we live in a more modern
[1:22:53] day you know so I mean I I I have a hard
[1:22:57] time talking about bonko party soup
[1:22:59] suppers I don't even know what that is
[1:23:01] maybe they still do that but I think
[1:23:04] it's a much more you mind if I modernize
[1:23:06] it just a little bit here you know if we
[1:23:08] can't have modern worship with lights
[1:23:10] and effects and have the men looking
[1:23:13] like beatniks with sissified hairstyles
[1:23:15] and gold chains if we can't have the
[1:23:18] women standing on the stage with their
[1:23:20] ripped up jeans and their Jezebel
[1:23:22] appearance from head to toe if we can't
[1:23:25] have that we don't want it I say I don't
[1:23:27] want that I don't ever want that I want
[1:23:30] nothing to do with
[1:23:32] Hollywood
[1:23:34] see Jezebel Styles head to toe that's
[1:23:38] not a phrase of speech I literally mean
[1:23:41] all the way out to their fingers and
[1:23:44] toes Jezebel
[1:23:47] Styles enough
[1:23:49] said and let brother Bram says and let
[1:23:51] the women act any way they want to dress
[1:23:55] any way they want to immorally anything
[1:23:57] sex appeal becomes a Modern Trend here's
[1:24:00] what a prophet said in 1964 that I agree
[1:24:03] with in
[1:24:03] 2023 it's a
[1:24:07] disgrace he says in God of this evil age
[1:24:10] 1965 this is the West Coast over here
[1:24:12] furthest west you can go now the sin
[1:24:14] barrier has thundered down beneath the
[1:24:16] Earth and she's sinking places in Los
[1:24:18] Angeles and Hollywood sinking so many
[1:24:20] inches per hour no way to stop it yeah
[1:24:22] we're here most any time we'll hear the
[1:24:25] summons see he says in spiritual
[1:24:28] Amnesia I can imagine he says I can
[1:24:31] imagine seeing on one hot day in Samaria
[1:24:34] there the one of the greatest tourist
[1:24:36] cities of the world of that day it's
[1:24:38] it's something on the order of we'd say
[1:24:40] Miami or Hollywood or Los Angeles some
[1:24:43] of them places like that some great
[1:24:45] place for tourists and we can just
[1:24:47] imagine him seeing him th about Amos
[1:24:51] here and he had never been in such a
[1:24:53] city but he had the word of the Lord and
[1:24:56] he was coming to this great City where
[1:24:58] sin was heaped up on every side the
[1:25:01] ministers had all got away from the word
[1:25:04] of God and they hadn't had a profit in
[1:25:06] long years Brothers we must never get
[1:25:09] away from the word of God bethl Ministry
[1:25:12] team we must never get away from the
[1:25:14] word of God if we get away from the word
[1:25:17] of God then God's people will get away
[1:25:18] from the word of God and that's on us
[1:25:21] I'm here to tell you st stand strong my
[1:25:23] brothers Hallelujah the people will love
[1:25:26] you for it on that
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:29] day spiritual Amnesia I thought what a
[1:25:32] title I thought to myself spiritual
[1:25:37] Amnesia you know I thought about this I
[1:25:39] thought spiritual Amnesia really is the
[1:25:43] is the global pandemic not covid oh
[1:25:46] yeah spiritual
[1:25:51] amnesia
[1:25:52] Jesus had said in Matthew
[1:25:55] 10 fear now catch this catch it real
[1:25:59] close fear not them which kill the
[1:26:06] body what everybody was afraid of in
[1:26:09] Co fear not them which kill the
[1:26:13] body fear not
[1:26:15] them fear not them which kill the body
[1:26:19] but are not able to kill the soul
[1:26:23] but
[1:26:24] rather fear him which is able to destroy
[1:26:28] both soul and Body in
[1:26:31] hell I could hardly believe how men and
[1:26:35] women who were supposed to be Believers
[1:26:36] were so afraid of what covid-19 could do
[1:26:39] to their bodies that they stopped coming
[1:26:41] to
[1:26:41] church for months even after it was even
[1:26:46] after it had just reduced itself to just
[1:26:48] a a mild illness globally and they still
[1:26:51] stopped
[1:26:52] coming see even after it had mut mutated
[1:26:56] into into just a a mild flu at
[1:27:00] best now listen I mean and and then of

[1:28:07] know we observed and we took prudent
[1:28:10] steps for safety we had our brothers uh
[1:28:13] install high-tech air purification
[1:28:15] systems in our hva HVAC system so that
[1:28:19] it constantly purified the air we we red
[1:28:22] reduced the Gathering even for several
[1:28:23] weeks to a when it was at its peak and
[1:28:25] we reduced it to a skeleton broadcast
[1:28:28] crew we asked people you know for a
[1:28:30] while to wear mask as they entered or
[1:28:33] exited the building we did that for
[1:28:34] weeks we social distance inside and we
[1:28:37] went to fist bumping and we didn't even
[1:28:39] assemble on Wednesday nights up here
[1:28:42] together so I get it we did that there
[1:28:44] there was nothing wrong with that we
[1:28:46] acted responsibility we acted
[1:28:49] responsibly and we acted prudently there

[1:29:38] to no regard there was for the lack of
[1:29:41] assembling at the house of God and what
[1:29:44] it was doing to their
[1:29:48] soulen and to The Souls of their
[1:29:50] children

[1:30:30] not aware what a rarity you are in
[1:30:33] election have you lost that deeper sense
[1:30:36] of what you are in Christ are you do you
[1:30:39] remember that the Lord has set you free
[1:30:42] from
[1:30:43] sin don't do things that would harm your
[1:30:46] soul at trying to save your body let my
[1:30:49] body go to the grave but let my soul
[1:30:53] be humble before the
[1:30:56] Lord I want to accomplish the mission he
[1:30:59] desires me to
[1:31:03] accomplish you know how is it that
[1:31:06] we find ourselves in this day when we
[1:31:10] see what's happening in the world and
[1:31:13] the it's it's Dreadful in one sense and
[1:31:16] it's exhilarating in another brother the
[1:31:18] mark and I were talking about this this
[1:31:20] morning talking back and forth over over
[1:31:23] a a published um news news
[1:31:27] report and you can see that the world is
[1:31:30] headed towards
[1:31:32] self-destruction and that you should say
[1:31:34] how can you be happy over that well I'm
[1:31:36] not happy that the world is being
[1:31:37] destroyed I'm not happy that people are
[1:31:38] going to suffer that's terrible that's
[1:31:41] Dreadful it's why I preach and try to
[1:31:42] get them to not go through that you
[1:31:44] don't have to go through that there's a
[1:31:45] way
[1:31:46] out you can get a token you can get on
[1:31:49] board you don't have to stay here
[1:31:53] see it's terrible for the people who
[1:31:55] stay here but it's exhilarating for me
[1:31:57] to think because Jesus said when you see
[1:32:00] these things happening look up lift up
[1:32:03] your head your Redemption draweth
[1:32:06] nigh hallelujah how my how is it that we

[1:32:15] look to the future with great
[1:32:20] excitement I think I said to brother
[1:32:23] Mark I think we've already
[1:32:25] subconsciously let go of this world and
[1:32:27] realize we're part of another
[1:32:29] one how many are part of another one
