lord matthew chapter four i want to continue this evening by the help of the lord uh in our series we've been working on the seven vials of revelation so tonight will be part eight as i understand from the archives amen it just seems endless it just keeps going on and on and on i want to take for a subtitle tonight the god of this evil age it's one of the sermons that brother branham included in his series on the vials and so we have maybe only one statement from it tonight but we'll carry more in that direction on sunday the lord willing amen praise the lord i'm any time i get here on a wednesday night and preach i'm always okay if we don't have a sunday service amen because we're in glory and that service will be forever amen so praise the lord amen matthew chapter 4 we'll begin verse 1 and we'll read down through verse 11. praise the lord brother you're you're so familiar to me what's your name eric oh your brother john's buddy right yeah okay man i know this guy from somewhere praise the lord happy to have you here brother amen matthew chapter four verse one then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them so he's looking prophetically into the future and and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me then saith jesus unto him get thee hints satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him amen let's go to first john chapter 2 amen first john chapter 2 and we will read verses 15 through 17. first john chapter 2 15-17 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever amen let's pray master we thank you for your word this evening and we come to this sacred time now lord for the delivery of the word to the people and i i know lord that i have the mind of christ for this evening and that has weighed heavily on me lord it just it just seems to have struck me so deeply today that i that myself just a mortal man with ups and downs and plenty of failures and weaknesses and yet your love and and your word is so sure that you would that that that today i have been in communion with the mind of god and i come tonight with the word of the lord to this people how great is your love lord for us we that just blows my mind lord i can hardly get my mind wrapped around it but yet i know i stand here tonight i stand here with that 100 confidence lord i i'm unworthy of it we're all unworthy to hear anything from you of life but lord you loved us even while we were sinners so now that we're believers and we love you and we want to serve you surely lord god you will meet every need that we have in your word we commit ourselves into your hands in jesus name amen god bless your friends you can be seated it's interesting how that john sums up everything that's of the world in three categories the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and really no matter what you would face in this journey the devil is going to come after you in one or two or all three and you know he's making the point here that that that that we have a real devil and there are elements in this world that satan uses to draw you aside and to try to interrupt your journey to the promised land now you want to look at that 17th verse the world passeth away and the lust thereof so now you realize that everything and i i hope that you will catch this and really concentrate on this on just this one opening point that anything that you find yourself being drawn to that's outside of god's word and it happens to all of us more than three of you i know it happens to all of us the devil is constantly busy trying to draw us to the world away from the word he's not he's not hesitant to try that on you he tried it on the lord jesus he actually had such audacity that he he didn't just try to confound the written word he actually came to the highest form possible in the word flesh that's the highest form of the word of god is your flesh that's why it doesn't matter that's why satan doesn't care how right you are in your doctrine or how religious you are so he he it's not about he's not worried about how straight-laced your life can be what he is aware of is that if you miss the getting the new birth then you won't come up in the resurrection anyway see so when you realize then that god's ultimate goal is and has always been this is not new it is and it has always been to get his thoughts to a prophet and a prophet to put it on a scroll and a scroll to be read to the people and the people to have faith in the word and then the holy spirit would come and anoint that and live inside of his of his family so that now the thoughts of god that started the whole thing are living behind skin amen and this is why it matters how we live and and where we go and what we do that's why it is it is a um it is it is nonsensical and for a christian to that's why that's why jesus would say you know if you love the world or john would say concerning the teaching of christ if you love the world and the things of the world it's because the presence of god is not inside of you now you don't want to get trapped up in your fallen flesh because your fallen flesh loves the world and that's that's the greatest battle ever fault that's what you're here fighting that someday we'll have bodies that won't be subject to the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and the lust of the eye i'll be glad for that hour but right now we're proving that we're one in a million we're proving this last day bride by the way she lives not just the confession of her lips not just the convincing in her mind but her life is a living testimony of the word of god and in and in that testimony she proves that the word is true your life let me say it like this your life validates christ amen now i hope you take that and absorb the weight and the responsibility and let yourself feel the confidence and trust that god has in you by giving you the word of this hour and living inside you say i don't feel like much you're the apple of his eye oh i i don't see how i i'm no good i'm i'm nothing and you he sees no iniquity though israel had all kinds of iniquity jehovah said i don't see iniquity in jacob amen wasn't that it wasn't there but his grace we preach to you on the grace the encampment of the redeemed that that the the shout of the king was among them i'm here to tell you tonight the shout of the king is once again in the camp and so you just remember that all of the things especially teenagers remember that all of the things the devil tempts you with the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye the pride of life they are all passing away that's what we read and the world now what was the world the lust of the fleshless of the iron pride of life that was the world and the world passes the way and the lust thereof so i want to give you a good encouragement tonight hold on little brad it's not going to be much longer oh we're going to a land and we won't ever have to come back and fight this kind of a fight again hallelujah the devil will be put permanently in his place he deserves this is all as we've been studying the seven vials of revelation we found out that to me what is perhaps one of the grandest points of understanding is that all the all the mysteries of the book of revelation happen in a cluster and brother branham uses that word quite a you know quite a bit and and we find out that everything you read that's a mystery to the world and they you know they said to brother branham my john must have eaten a hot pepper that night before he went to bed and you know brother branham says aren't you ashamed you're supposed to be a minister of the gospel aren't you ashamed to say something like that and and how many preachers and with with with eight in 10 and 12 years of theology school with phds avoid that book that we study so freely and love hallelujah i i remember some time ago some years ago uh the the leading mega church pastor of our fair city got got asked the question oh you know what about the seven spirits of god you know what what about the seven spirits of god you know there's a discussion about the trinity and of course as far as he was concerned you're all going to hell and william branham's already in hell based on one thing one thing alone just one that he does not accept the trinity doctrine he said that on the radio i heard it myself and it doesn't matter all the millions that he led to christ it doesn't matter all the millions that were healed it doesn't matter all of the dust said the lord and all the miracles and everything that god did to validate it it all is for not because of that one thing and what he doesn't realize is is that he has fallen victim to us to three unclean spirits like frogs that came out of the beast oh my friends aren't you glad tonight that you have liberty you you see the word of god so clearly it's a ridiculous argument that they make i mean brother jason has so proven that here teaching on the godhead and and the trinity that they so-called it's my goodness it's a derived doctrine you know added to and crafted over hundreds of years it wasn't even an original teaching brother jason proved historically you know incontrovertibly that when they first began to even talk about it and put it on paper the holy ghost wasn't even included in it amen and now they want me and it wasn't taught by the early church but yet i'm supposed to believe that i'm going to go to hell because i don't believe a catholic version of babylonian polytheism oh blessed are your eyes for they see these things friends and it's all flowing in a cluster i think it's perhaps one of the grandest thing grandest of understandings from the book of revelation that has just been so eye-opening to us that it has all been perfectly synchronized that's what a feat what an accomplishment for the holy spirit that that that at all of these events happening in a cluster down through centuries and yet it's it's all been perfectly and harmoniously and flawlessly synchronized by the holy ghost throughout all of history amen like uh as brother branham referred to it like a great work of of music from a master composer and how that god sent a a human messenger into the earth as a conductor uh a conductor of an elected orchestra oh my a people whose very names are recorded in the book of life in the section of the lamb before the foundation of the world how that seven ages uncovered and as seven ages were uncovered we found out that it's been the history of the seven spirits of god living wasn't that we had seven gods any more than we got three there's one see but it's the seven spirits of god living and working through the true church that's what the ages were about the christ living and working through his true church battling the false church in every age and she's still battling it i say fight on i say i will fight to my last dying breath i want my last dying breath to be satan is a liar and god's word is true we find that it was uh it's been a battle of the true church versus the false church and how that according to luke 17 and i'm just covering these rudimentary things that because we're we we skipped a sermon on our series god pulled me off of it i'm trying to get back in track you know we found that according to luke 17 24 how that it all happens and all everything coming down in all of this cluster how that we found out that it was it was referred to as lightning that traveled through the earth from east to west over 2 000 years of church history interestingly enough when you read luke 17 24 let me have that g man luke 17 24 uh sorry to jump you again i didn't i should have sent that to you already luke 17 24 for as the lightning that lightneth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part unto heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day now it's interesting this term go back please it's interesting this term under heaven all right so we see that that that the lightning that the all of this cluster of events that's happening in the ages and happening in the seals and happening under the trumpets and happening under the vials and it's all been synchronous and harmonized by the holy spirit and it's it was it was shown to be traveling through the earth like lightning from east to west and this whole term under heaven now this term under is an interesting greek word that has uh a compound meaning firstly it speaks of a particularly of a place meaning uh meaning a place uh wince you know a place from whence it came from under from which something comes forth and the next thing is that it is a losing here's its effect it's a losing or freeing from under something you're and so so when you when you look in other scriptures and you cross the reference that word you find a host of places two of my favorites that i'll touch on tonight is acts 2 24 whom god has speaking of christ peter says whom god hath raised up having loosed the pains uh uh let me get a lot of place having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should beholden of it so now we realize that here's the losing part of that greek word that word that meant under heaven as the lightning travels from the east to the west under heaven so shall the coming of the son of man be so what is it done the word came to loose god's people it came to set them free from the bondage of sin it came to set you free and set you at liberty from the tyranny of the of the evil one i'm glad that that lightning in every age has liberated god's people and then you find this voice speaking it's the exact same voice in ii peter chapter 1 verse 17 where peter speaking of it here in his testifying second peter 1 17 for he receiveth from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory and here's what it said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased i'm here to tell you something friends that that same voice that has spoke again in our day and it came from the same place because it's the same lightning from the east to the west and as it spoke of jesus it speaks of you and it's the same voice when the mighty angel descended what was it it was the voice of the archangel and what does it do it's setting you free it's giving you liberty it's giving you overcoming power that's what the lightning under heaven does see i'll tell you something friends i've been loose from the pains of death just like jesus was because you know why it wasn't possible that death could hold him oh the same voice that loosed him has loosed you you've been loosed from the pains of death he has loosed her and i want you to know something this world can't hold you the same way it couldn't hold him the grave couldn't hold him it can't hold you one of these days gravity is going to lose its power over me hallelujah we've got a day coming on to god friends and gravity will lose its hold every promise that we've waited for all these years will become material and he who you've looked for will suddenly come to his temple so we found that him working through the ages in a cluster we found the understanding of the seven seals and how it unfolded to us and when it did we discovered the power of god was portrayed as living creatures and you know you you go in the book of revelation and you read about the lion and the ox and the man and the flying eagle because it's got a these these living creatures represent a power a beast in the bible represents power and then you find that the antichrist also had riding beast he's riding a white horse and he's riding a red horse then he's riding a black horse and then we come to the last day and he's trying to ride a pale horse and he could ride he could actually win if it wasn't for always losing he could actually ride if it wasn't for the presence of the bride of christ saying not so fast oh boy oh look we're still here and the grace is still here and you're not going to get on that pony just yet hallelujah friends do you understand the authority that's in your life today as a believer so when he comes into your home with sickness know this he has no authority you have it all amen amen when he strikes your finances when he strikes your marriage when he strikes your children just to understand this he has no authority because you have it all hallelujah he doesn't have the power of the spoken word because you've got the power of the spoken word he has no power of creation because why that voice is in the bride of christ so we discovered the power of god as living creatures christ living through his bride this all in a cluster all happening synchronously down through history christ living through his bride battling the beast powers of the antichrist a war that began in in heaven brother branham said and spilled over into the earth and from genesis to revelation and now we've had 2 000 years of intense warfare amen they've had terrible natural wars they don't compare because you say but millions have died in these wars but jesus said don't fear him who can destroy body fear him who can destroy soul in hell so the spiritual wars have been far more devastating to humanity than the natural wars you know natural you you die but if you die in christ you really can't die you don't die you can't die it's impossible for you to die see and so so we realized that this terrible spiritual warfare has been going on this intense warfare during the the redemption time of the gentile church the seven trumpets we've been studying the seven trumpets how they chronicle the restoration and the regathering of israel to the feast of atonement we found out that there that that you know in every all down through the ages they were unfolding to the jews so that when moses and elijah get to them with this very message and this very holy ghost that you so love and enjoy that's going to be part of their message because they think they've been abandoned and it's going to take moses and elijah to say no no no let's go back to the trumpets i'm going to show you you never were abandoned he was always working even when it looked horrible even when it looked the worst ever it was the tender hand of jehovah see so it chronicles the restoration the seven vials that we've been speaking of particularly striking partially in every age we found that and proved it by the bible and of course in every age as they partially are unfolded they provide an opportunity each time for the beast system to take its next step forward into you know what i would call the political slash uh natural realms of mankind we see them unfolding as temporary judgments and and and each time each time that they as those vials began to unfold temporarily in each age poured out partially remember remember we've taught on it then we find that each time say brother jason what does it mean can you give me one example i'll give you the best one how that's how that the vials allowed satan to to progress each time to progress because the most devastating impact of the viles is that every time a temporary judgment is coming you find satan capturing each time and with each age a little more of the minds of man of the whole entire human race so that at the end time by the time you reach the seventh one and it's poured out in the tribulation period in its fullness you find man's mind totally gone he has slowly encroached upon the sanity of man so that the bible says in the end time he'll even lose the ability to discern between right and wrong and the only salvation is the mind of christ the only way you stay sane the only way you know what to do the only thing only way you know how to act and react is by the mind of christ and so paul says let this mind which was in christ being you assemble yourselves more as you see that evil day approaching because the time will come when man won't endure sound doctrine he'll heap to themselves teachers having itching ears people will get preachers who'll tell them what they want the gospel to be remember i said to you whatever if you're if you're not born again you're now under the insane notion that it comes now it's always been through seven ages but now it's coming to its perfect perfect climax it's reaching its zenith it's now satan's eden it's now the he's now the god of the civil lights brother the breton goes back to galatians back to the book of corinthians and he proves that that day was this day and in no other day could he be caught or would he be called the god of this evil age as god taken six thousand years to build his eden now satan has had six thousand years to build his and the only safety is the mind of christ that mankind would go completely insane and be unable to discern between right and wrong and i said to you how that that this is the we're now at the age say how in the world did we get to when brother branham was alive there was only 900 and some odd different denominations how did we go in a half century what took 2 000 years to get to and in and in and in the last 50 plus years we went from 900 and some to north of 33 000. amen minds of man going going crazy unable to discern between right and wrong and i said if if you're in this day listen friends you listen well if you're trying to get by and you have not allowed the mind of christ if you have not allowed the holy spirit to bring a gene to life in you if you have not surrendered your heart and let christ come in and be the all and all and be first and be the center then you know what you'll do you know what your mind will convince you to do you'll go around hunting the version of the gospel that you want to be true and there's plenty of preachers out there in this end time with itching ears many false prophets the bible doesn't say it doesn't you say people say oh the bible says there's a false prophet the bible says there will be many false prophets and they will deceive many and i'm here to tell you there's only one security and that's the word of god and that's the mind of christ and that's the new birth and that's the holy ghost and that's this message that god has given us in this hour it's the only place of safety and the only place of sanity amen you better have it first and foremost in your homes if you want your children to have even a fighting chance you better have the word of god first and foremost it ought to be the main theme in the center of our homes the center of our of our of our education in the center of our learning in the center of our family affairs in the center of our vacations this is not an hour that you cannot have that you must have the mind of christ on display this is the token time the death angel is in the camp and the death angel is coming to eat everything that's not under the blood oh my so we see them unfolding and satan capturing the minds of men more and more amen and it i heard brother jack this morning on our call in bible study but the jack made it a a point that is so simple but it blew my mind and brother jack just says think of this all of this revelation prophecy everything that we read about all of this stuff happening in a cluster say oh my goodness it's just going to go on and on and on and on no it's not no it can't because it's because everything that we find ends up under the seventh seal and winds itself out and even time itself finally comes to an end after the millennium but we find that everything in those prophet prophetical uh things that we study all have to be finished by the last half of one week of israel's time clock everything has to happen in the last half of daniel's 70th week and so we find that that christ comes and lives out the first half of that first of that 70th week and there's only a half a week left to redeem israel i'm here to tell you something friends god is not just going to keep waiting forever and ever his his desires his bowels are yearning for benjamin oh hallelujah and he cannot have benjamin until you are tucked away in the palace when i see what's happening in israel and i see what's happening in russia i see what's happening in china i'm here to tell you something friends we are on our way to the palace you can just believe it tonight we're on our way to the palace oh my so when he says now in first john 2 back where we took our part of our text 16 and 17 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life first john 2 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the father i could just stop right there and just look you all in the eye and spend the rest of the service mute and just give you that the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye the pride of life look at me it's not of the father it's not it didn't come from him it can't survive stop chasing it because it's going down it's going down in flames see it's not of see it's not of the father do you believe john it's not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god i love that but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever it's observed that satan is seen here in the wilderness temptation of jesus following the exact same strategy that he did in genesis 3. this that shouldn't surprise you because you know we we see that babylonian system you see it that babylonian system in the beginning of the bible in the middle of the bible and at the end of the bible you see it under nimrod in ancient babylon you see it under nebuchadnezzar in the middle of the bible and then you see it at the end of the book of revelation only now it's called mystery babylon and it's unknown to the world that it's the same babylon see and people are falling for it and so we find that satan is now coming to christ in the wilderness and he's using the exact same pattern this is an important point that you you should really pay attention to because when you watch an enemy if you can watch you you were supposed to know our enemy and learn his patterns see brother branham taught us that and so when you see the pattern that he uses it's the exact same pattern that he went after even in genesis 3. amen so you just remember brother jason uh took you into the scripture and showed you that that that what john that that what matthew is talking about in the fourth chapter of matthew is the same pattern repeated in genesis 3. see because we find that first what does he do first he appealed to the lust of the flesh the desire to do something apart from god's will the lust of the eyes the desire to have something apart from god's will amen third he appealed to the pride of life the desire to be something apart from god's will now that's exactly what he did satan tried in the eternities that was his eye disease i will ascend i will be like the most high he didn't want to obey god's word is it any wonder is it does it surprise you that when he comes to anoint you he tries to talk you into doing things contrary to god's will he tries to get you to do things that are out of the will of god the lust of the flesh he tries to get you to have things you know go after the world here satan offered eve something and he's offering jesus something and it's now lust of the eyes and oh he's a master at it he's a master at it friends your only hope is the holy ghost and even then it's still the greatest battle ever fought but you can win it you can win it there is overcoming power in the blood of the lamb hallelujah oh my the lust of the flesh the desire to do something apart from god's will the lust of the eyes the desire to have something apart from god's will the pride of life the desire to be something apart from god's will how many young men and young women have wanted to be something they saw they wanted to be somebody they saw on youtube they wanted to be somebody they saw on a gridiron they wanted to be somebody they saw on a basketball court i want to be somebody that hung on a tree i want to be somebody that walked calvary's road that's who i want to be i want to be like the one who ascended on high and death couldn't hold him that's who i want to be like all three of the tests are simply variations of the one great temptation satan is bringing because his goal you have to look at his goal brother barry talked about this at the men's breakfast we had such a wonderful time how that satan you know here he what is he trying to do he's trying to he he's trying to destroy the commission of christ because here jesus comes he's the savior of the world if satan can derail him and knock him off of god's plan then the world don't get saved because he's the savior he's a redeemer and if satan can knock him off of god's will if satan can offer him something that's a lust of his eye if satan can offer him a lust of his flesh if satan can offer him a pride of life and knock him off path then he can derail the commission the world don't get saved the world don't get redeemed there is no healing there is no new birth there is no holy ghost we're all going to perish anyway if the holy ghost if paul said if the resurrection is false and if it's fake and there's no resurrection then our preaching is vain your worship is vain your faith is in vain we might as well all go eat drink and be merry i'm so glad it's real i'm so glad it's true i'm so glad i've proven it and we got people in this audience tonight who can say i have proven it i have proven that it's real i have proven that it's accessible hallelujah brother branham says in the god of this evil age he says strange now now remember i've already told you this is in brother branham's series on where his burden is on the vials i've proven it to you we're not recapping all of that so and and what i've showed you is that that the vial is pouring out partially and every agent poured out partially and it was released into the air so it's all of the madness of man's mind see and part of that madness is to get you to disregard everything i'm saying to you tonight don't let that happen don't be satan's victim amen the holy spirit compels me to walk among you look you in the eye and say don't be satan's victim don't be satan's victim don't be satan's victim he has only one goal and that is to steal and to kill and to destroy he's not your friend he's he doesn't love you he doesn't even like you he hates your family he hates the prophet he hates the word he hated jesus hallelujah it's why cain killed abel because he hated that don't be satan's victim friends you have a choice tonight to not be how many want to take the choice to not be say i'm not going to be a victim i'm not going down with him i'm i realize the world is passing away in all the lust and so i'm going to get rid of it now i'm not chasing those kinds of things anymore that cluster has already reached its climax satan has already reached his zenith it's already too late for the world [Music] amen the church has already kicked christ out they've already become their own voice so brother branham says here in this vials series 1965 august 1 paragraph 40. strange now strange now and i should just get your attention a prophet like wow this is a this is a dispensational angel this is the guy who spends half of his time in another realm this is a guy who's stood and talked face to face many times with the lord jesus the angel of the lord's presence amen he starts this paragraph with a word two words strange now after some 1900 years of gospel preaching now she that is the world system is more evil than in the days when he was here the world system is more evil the world is heading to a great climax you know that the lord is fulfilling his word on every hand that tells me two things he's in control of that antichrist spirit and he's in control of me he's fulfilling his word he's got a word for the unbelievers he's got a word for the make believers and he's got a word for the believers and he is fulfilling it as we speak you're sitting in this service tonight and you're and god is trying to fulfill the promise of his word in your life and in your heart and the only power on earth that can stop him is you you must let this mind which was in christ be in you this is an age i'm going to close but hear me out to the end will you this is an age of maximum temptation don't be naive there's there's a reason that we organize our lives to avoid these things of the world there's a reason men turn their head quickly there's a reason that you shouldn't watch certain things on your phone or your laptop or your computer there's a reason you shouldn't go certain places there's a reason you should come to church there's a reason you should read your bible there's a reason you should have an active prayer life there's a reason that you don't hang around with the wrong friends there's reasons see this is an age of maximum temptation on the lust of the flesh maximum temptation on the lust of the eyes maximum temptation for the pride of life so when jesus said in matthew 4 10 and 11 then said jesus unto him get thee hint satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve now verse 11 is profound then the devil leaveth him that's the first half of the verse the second half and angels came and ministered unto him so now three things happened in rapid succession jesus gave the command of the word to lucifer amen and immediately lucifer left people have done that people who follow satan satan left him when jesus gave the devil the command of the word satan refused to do it you know what the command was worship the lord thy god he gives him the command of the word and as soon as he gives him the command of the word to worship god satan refused to do it and satan left him and so do those who he has control of they refuse to obey the command oh you might come to a church building i get that you might you might come into this building you might sing louder than anybody else in the building oh but i'm here to tell you there's a people who come into churches and sing louder than anybody else but they refuse to let their lives become a living worship [Applause] they don't mind gathering at a building they don't mind lifting their voice and singing to the top of their lungs they don't mind being in a choir they don't mind memorizing scripture verse but they won't ever allow their life to be a worship that your whole life is a living worship of the almighty god satan won't do it those who he has control of won't do it they will not allow their lives they they will not submit themselves amen they'll sing they'll come in a building but they won't submit themselves to the word of god for their life amen they will not allow their life to become a living worship of god satan did this same thing friends you understand he did this same thing back in eternity he he was acting the same way back then when morning stars sang together he wasn't included in there he wouldn't come in worship when morning stars and sons of god shouted for joy i want to tell you something he wouldn't be a part of that camp and oh praise the name of god he's not a part of this camp he's not a part of this church don't let him be a part of this church don't let him be a part of your family don't let him be a part on your job or on your in your schools or in the hallways don't let him be apart don't let him be in your camp this is the camp of the king this is the camp of the presence of almighty god oh there should be no place for him in our homes no place for him and on jobs no place for him in our classrooms there should be no place for him in our lives i love the second part of that 11th verse angels came from heaven and fulfilled it oh my the same angels who made the decision back in the eternities to worship him for the same one that comes now from the eternities to comfort him oh they were the ones that were there to minister to him and this today friends you realize this is a perfect example for humanity today the word is identifying those who refuse to bow to the word of god those who and it's it's really a difference it's really this simple it's identifying those who refuse to bow to the word and those who can't refuse to bow to the word i want to be a cat refused i want my home to be i can't refuse i want my life to be a camera if you say i can't refuse to worship the lord god hallelujah i'ma cannot refuse count me with them what about you friends what about you bethel tabernacle what about you young people are you willing tonight to say i'll be the one who can't refuse i'll give my whole life to it how many in this building tonight after hearing a word like this say i'm ready to take the way with the lord's despised you i started out with jesus and i'm going through hallelujah oh glory to god friends that's what the word has brought to us in this hour that's what it's about you oh i tell you sometimes people think teaching has to be you know just mundane and and all memory verse i love i love the teaching that we have across this pulpit it's full of zeal and it's full of energy and it's full of fire and it's full of belief and faith and it's changing you from glory to glory to glory to glory oh stand up bethel tabernacle let's give the lord some worship tonight and say allah oh lord god you're worthy you're worthy to direct my life you're worthy to make my decisions you're worthy to cause me to choose your word hallelujah oh friends i i couldn't preach it any harder to you i couldn't i don't think i could make it any plainer you just heard the results of about 15 hours of nearly unbroken study to come out here for 50 minutes and tell you that my message is this jesus loves you he loves you he died for you he sent his word for you hallelujah he ascended on high for you how many say lord i love you too i love you too and i i want i
