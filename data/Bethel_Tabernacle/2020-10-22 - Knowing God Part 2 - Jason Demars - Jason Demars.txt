keeps us lord we just want to commit ourselves commit this time to your lord we ask that your holy spirit would just take control just wanted to give you all and as i'm giving this announcement if musicians want to just sneak out now to your spot we'll get to the scriptures just in a few minutes um i was planning on going on a missions trip moving forward by faith i i had booked my ticket for november 2nd and things on the other end in turkey we just kept getting blocked from from the ministers not being able to get any kind of travel permission inside of the country and translator not being able to go get a travel permission to go even outside of the city i shouldn't say the country they can't even leave their city there and go from city to city so as that as it became apparent that we weren't going to be able to have a translator or have the people come to meet us at a central place just felt like well the lord's in control he knows what he's doing and we're not going to run through a closed door that's painful well i made that statement to my family and my daughter avery said that sounds kind of painful and you're you're right avery in a lot of different ways it's painful spiritually speaking it can be very painful and and when the lord closes the door he has a lot of things in mind the situation in turkey is changing persecution is rising there's a turkish pastor in the city that we're visiting that's in prison multiple minister iranian ministers have been deported back to iran so i i don't know the lord's in control and i'm not afraid i just want to be where he wants me to be and so we'll see what happens over the next few months just keep those believers in prayer in particular brother shaheen and brother omed as they're doing their best to minister to the flock over there also just wanted i already announced to the families but in case anybody's listening online or just didn't didn't get the update this friday uh evening at my house we'll have the junior youth bible study that will start at 6 30 pm and go until 9 and the ages are 8 to 12. so everyone's welcome to to come in that ain't raid age range and parents are welcome to drop their drop the young ends off or uh you can stay as well if you want to all right with that said let's go to the scriptures let's stand up and read jeremiah chapter 9 and we're going to read verse 23 and 24. thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches verse 24 but let him that glorious glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord which exercised lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things i delight saith the lord amen may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated so we're continuing our subject knowing god this is part two and i'm going to be going into uh the attributes of god as i spoke about previously and there's there's a long long list and the list that i have is just a starting list really of the attributes of god and you know it isn't it isn't necessarily about knowing memorizing a list it isn't about we talked about last time knowing facts about god uh it's about knowing god there's a great difference it isn't you know brother branham made this comment multiple times that it wasn't people would say well you just don't know your bible and he would respond well i may not know my bible well but i know the author real well and of course he's not encouraging uh biblical illiteracy and he wasn't himself biblically illiterate he was extremely well versed in the bible and he studied it and studied history and and he studied theology on his own and you know he went through many many many different books and he knew it very well but the point is well taken in that it's not about knowing facts about the bible it's about knowing the author knowing him personally knowing him by experience knowing him by spiritual revelation you know the natural man receives not the things of the spirit of god for their spiritually discerned and it's only as god reveals it to you will you know something that's any that's worth knowing we talked about that before you can know so many facts even the bible says you can know all mysteries and still not be in the place god wants you to be you know without love you're nothing know all mysteries without love you're nothing and that's important as we study the word of god we have to start from that place also what is your motive what is your motive for studying is it to have a lot of knowledge and be able to answer a lot of questions is it to be able to be uh give an answer to every person that comes to you and and be able to well scripture says we should have an answer for the hope that lies within us but that shouldn't be our only purpose to be able to win an argument no our motive and our heart should be knowing him when we open this book our purpose should be not knowing about him knowing him thank you brother our purpose when we pray shouldn't be to get things it's to be to realize the presence of god we have to be seeking him in his word for the right reasons if we don't do it for the right reasons if we do it for the wrong motive in our heart what is it what did we talk about you become hard you become hardened you become proud and you look down on other people because why aren't they seeking knowledge the way i am why don't they why aren't they studying the way i study why aren't they doing see the motives wrong the objective is wrong and it when the motive is wrong it results it results in the wrong fruit i mean we can go down through history of the message movement and we can talk about people that preach thousands of sermons over a long many many years of time and you could go down and say man what a wonderful preacher and realize they walked away from everything and they're turning around and spitting on it so what is is it about knowledge is about knowing about the message facts about the mysteries and we can go on down the line and bring everything in perfect balance no it's not that's not what it's about it's not about knowing facts that that you know the bible says the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life doesn't mean we throw the letter away it means that the spirit comes into us and lets us know about this letter but without that spirit and studying the letter it kills so first it takes the spirit the right motive the right heart as we approach knowing the lord not about knowing about facts about it's knowing him personally all right isaiah chapter 6 and i just wanna as i was studying this and putting down the notes for the for the first time several months ago and i was approaching to preach it for the first time i i woke up so early in the morning on a sunday morning and i just had this this this powerful sense of awe that came over me and the the sense that who am i yeah to stand up and speak about this subject i can't i can't even open my mouth to speak about god the greatness his glory his majesty how can i stand up and try to say something coherent about him amen and it was just this i entered into the spirit that isaiah entered into and what if what what a sense of awesome dread that i felt and as i approached that subject and and i feel it again as i approach the scripture in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne this is significant king uzziah started out as a tremendous king and he was hailed and lauded as a great hero of judah amen and in jerusalem and king uzziah failed miserably because of pride right and he died and his his work what he did ended there so it's significant it's not for for no reason that it's spoken in the year king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon the throne the human ruler dies and goes and lays and rots in the tomb but there's one who's sitting on the throne he's supreme it does this isn't jehovah sitting upon the throne this is the word for the supreme ruler the he's he's the true supreme king of judah and of all the earth he is still sitting upon the throne uzziah's dying in a tomb the year that a king dies is a year of mourning as i understand it they don't even hold the coronation for the next king and the celebration until that year of mourning is completed so here we have this year of mourning isaiah isaiah was a relative of the royal family if you're not aware of that he was a connected person he was part of the aristocracy so to speak it didn't get him that far because he was sawed in half but he still was a connected person so that he could walk into the palace amen he was not prevented or hindered at all because he was a part of that family the royal family and so isaiah saw the lord sitting upon the throne the one that doesn't change the one that doesn't alter and that throne was high and lifted up and the train of his garment just the train of his garment filled the temple let alone his very being just the train of his garment filled up the temple next verse above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with two he covered his face and with two he covered his feet and with two he did fly these two these seraphim never sinned even once they were perfectly sinless and yet in the presence of this great king they had to cover their feet and they had to cover their face think about that for a second sinless creatures made to be in the presence of god because of the holiness of god they had to cover themselves so even perfect sinlessness is nothing nothing in comparison with the almighty amen next verse and one cried to another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory let's go back to that scripture holy holy holy why does he say it three times if you're familiar remember jesus would say verily verily or in aramaic he would have been saying amen amen what is he saying he's putting an emphasis upon this it's a hebrew way of speaking it's like an exclamation point verbally giving an explanation point amen amen i say unto you here they only they don't do it two times they add a third time and no it's not for the trinity holy holy holy what is it saying this god is different than you he's different than you he's different than you what does that mean it's speaking of infinite infinite holiness amen is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory so his train fills the temple and his glory fills the whole earth next verse and the post of the doors moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke so just the cherubim spoke and the posts and the place shook like there was an earthquake incredible and yet they're nothing in comparison with the one who sits on the throne the next verse this is such a startling thing that isaiah says here then said i woe is me for i am undone that word woe is a is it's literally in the hebrew oy if you know in the yiddish language they say oy vey what is he saying it's a passionate cry of despair amen he is literally screaming out in despair whoa is me this isn't just close me he's crying out in this the presence of this vision i'm i'm i'm in i'm in despair for i am undone the word undone is speaking of destroy to be destroyed to perish to cause to cease another way of saying is to everything has crumbled to pieces you hear the statement that a person they've they've got it all together right here in isaiah in as he sees this vision he says i don't have it all together i am i've seen the lord of hosts and i am i am disintegrated the word means just to come to cease to perish i've literally disintegrated i'm destroyed i'm in despair just coming into the presence of almighty god have we met this god have you met this god have you come come to know him this is not a pentecostal baby doctrine this is not a pentecostal baby verse this is a reality that brother branham experienced he said i when the angel of the lord would come to me i felt like a hunted animal talk about being undone talk about being in a place where you feel only despair what does a haunted animal feel like despair what is it for us as godly as we might be to come in the presence of god we should experience that aw and reverence of him it's not just something yes his presence makes us happy and shout but sometimes his make us his presence makes us fearful in awe wanting to just say i'm in despair and then notice what he says next this is the prophet of god this is the holiest man in all of israel this is god's mouthpiece this is the man that god has veiled behind and this is what he said i am a man of unclean lips this is three things that he goes into i'm in despair my existence is literally crumbled to pieces and my lips are not clean my mouth is dirty what i speak what i say in comparison to the presence of this august being oh yes is filth recognize recognize what your problem is what our problems are too many times in american christianity and in many of our worship songs the real problem that people has it have are they feel bad they're a little sad they have a couple life problems and god can solve them for him that's fantastic but that has nothing to do with salvation you are a lost and dead sinner you're dead in your sins there's nothing you can do to please god and you're standing here like god owes you something god does not owe you anything and you cannot give god anything that he wants see the position you're in you're dead and you're without hope according to scripture but god who is rich in mercy provided a sacrifice to stand in your place he did it and he calls you and he his kindness leads you to repentance god is not here to make your life easy god is here to save your soul and change your life to fill you with his spirit to transform you but i i would say that most christians have not had this experience where they've come to the place where said woe is me for i am undone i have unclean lips and i'm amongst the people of unclean lips no they just want to feel good about themselves they're dead and you're dead unless you have experienced this i'm a sinner and i'm i have nothing i can offer god only only by his grace only by the blood of christ only by the transforming power of the baptism of the holy ghost can i experience salvation and we'll experience troubles and god will help us and god will deliver us and god will do many things for us but god is more interested in the problem of sin than he is in the problem of your discomfort god will give discomfort to his children to his seed in order to produce godliness in order to produce a reflection of himself brother branham his first experience of god scared him here isaiah experienced god i would say very frightened he's extremely scared and god didn't say oh here honey it's okay no he said okay you recognize the reality you are undone you do have unclean lips and you're around the people that have unclean lips and you should respond this way when you come into the presence of the king the lord of hosts next verse but that wasn't the end of the story god's grace comes forth now notice isaiah didn't even ask this was just sovereign grace of god then flew one of the seraphims unde unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs off the altar isaiah just recognized the reality and he spoke the reality of what he was experiencing right there and god said you're right and here's a solution he took the tongue from the altar put it upon his lips painful very painful your iniquity is taken away and your sin is purged next verse amen verse 8 also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then said i here am i send me he recognized his problem god brought a solution and god said who will go for us and it didn't it didn't hinder him knowing himself knowing where he came from knowing what he was it didn't hinder isaiah saying here i am send me because why he realized the one who was sending would be with him would be in him and would speak through him would empower him to do it isaiah knew that and what a glorious thing you know god isn't here to make us wallow in our problems our sins our mistakes he offers a solution we receive it by faith and then we can walk forward with confidence we don't have to say oh i can't i can't do it well didn't moses say that to the lord and the lord was what he was angry with moses for saying i i i'm not good at speaking moses misunderstood it's not you doing the work moses god was doing the work god was doing the speaking god was veiled is veiled behind his prophets amen and he's not ashamed to veil himself behind his prophets even knowing their condition so as we look at who this great and holy god i think i think it's just good for all of us not just through hearing preaching but uh very frequently to think and meditate on the majestic glory and the awesome grandeur of the god that we serve you know his his splendor his greatness should provoke us to worship and and too often we think about ourselves and our own needs when we pray i think let's let's flip that around a little bit and let's think about how great how amazing how powerful how glorious god is and don't just think about it and make it up from your own mind i mean there's literally hundreds of scriptures you can go through to feed your soul on the greatness of god and i want to start going through uh i have about 16 different attributes of god it'll take me um multiple sermons to go through that but we'll just get started and get as far as we can the first attribute of god i want to look at is the aloneness or the uniqueness of god genesis 1 1 starts and says in the beginning god in the beginning god so any turn before the beginning was obviously eternity in eternity god dwelt alone in fact that's just the word that we use today to describe him he wasn't even god yet because in english the word god means a an object of worship there was nowhere no one yet there to worship him he was just the eternal one this word here is in the beginning elohim it's an interesting word because if you if you break that word down el means strong one and ohim in hebrew means to swear or bind by an oath so in the beginning elohim he was already the strong one bound by an oath he's the first one to appear in the bible the fact is he was he was already there with the god of his promises the god of his grace the god of his mercy all the plan had already been set forth the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world your name was written on the book before the foundation of the world exodus 15 verse 11. who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like the glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders those are those are some incredible words that are put together glorious in holiness fearful in praises ah provoking praises we should have that in our life we should experience that in our lives shouldn't be just singing a worship song and i feel good there should be some sense of ah that you have about the greatness of god amen sometimes and unfortunately it's our it's our nature is that we begin to think about god and we attribute to god attributes that are after our own human way of thinking and that's why we need scripture scripture corrects us this message corrects us to not not turn god into an idol that's after our own way of looking our own way of thinking there's no one like god who is like unto thee o lord among the gods no one absolutely no one romans 11 34 through 36 for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counselor or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen god is not in need of anything we can give amen amen who who who has first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him in other words you're going to give to god and he's got to pay it back no it's not he doesn't need anything from you he is complete in himself he's absolutely complete in himself now you might scratch your head and say well why did he create why is there this you have to stop there if god is not completing himself we have a problem because we now we have a being that needs something from us god does not need anything from us in god are attributes those attributes need to be expressed need to be manifested one of god's attributes is light god is light god is love these things require manifestation whatsoever doth make manifest is light the apostle paul said so light is manifested so in god it's to manifest himself well if there's no one else there who's going to see it so god is completely satisfied in himself and therefore we can be completely satisfied in him you know if if we're coming to a being that's not satisfied in himself how then can we possibly be completely satisfied in him he is god is love god is the ultimate perfection amen he needs i repeat it the third time he needs nothing from you god is happy god is joyful with or without you with or without you he doesn't somehow get complete when you lift your hands to worship him he doesn't get bigger when you praise him or testify about him he is who he is he never changes he can't be added to he cannot be taken away and again i say there are attributes that he must express that's clear and he wants to be worshipped but again he has to be all satisfying within himself for of him and through him and to him are all things except for he needs to be worshipped he needs to be added to by your faith no not true at all for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen everything belongs to god in the first place there's nothing we can add or take away from him god is self-sufficient he's not sufficient because of you through you or something that you had he's self-sufficient we derive our life and everything from him amen and the fact is if you really look at the the big picture here his family is him you know when we look at first corinthians 15 it says that god will be all in all so when when the the kingdom is finished the son son becomes subject to the father says that god might be all and in all so it's god and his family god and his attributes what is that all it's god it's god fully manifested on display and yet you know this isn't pantheism where everything is god your god and your god and your god that's not that's not what we're talking about it's god's life it's god's expression it's god's manifestation god in himself is a spirit we talked about that god covers all space and time the prophet said god is distinct and different and separate from you and yet you know when he let's put it this way when god gives birth to you is god less of a god no god remains the one who covers all space and time he doesn't lose part of himself when you come out from him when the logos comes out from him doesn't mean god somebody somehow becomes lesser god is now putting himself on display there's no word of blasphemy that could take away from who god is in his character and a central being and there's no amount of faith that we could put in him that would add to his essential being being and character he's the sum of all perfection amen yes god is glorified or dishonored by us but that takes nothing or away from him it doesn't add anything to him he is who he is i am that i am he doesn't change and nothing you do or don't do changes to glorify him is actually just recognizing a reality that exists to blaspheme him is to fall on a impenetrable rock it can only crush you you cannot crush it all the blasphemies and the nonsense that goes forth and on the internet and and on the radio waves and and the disgusting filth that is put forth through this whole earth and it's then the media that goes forward doesn't take anything away from god it doesn't change a thing in god it only brings forth judgment and wrath that is being stored up amen isaiah 40 verse 21 and 20 through 23 have you not known have you not heard hath it not been told you from the beginning have you not understood from the foundations of the earth it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in that bringeth the princes to nothing he makes the judges of the earth as vanity god is so far above us in his eyes your grasshoppers think about that from just a little bug that's what we are in comparison to the greatness of god and even that is a human way of explaining it it's bigger than that he's infinitely greater than you this is just a a anthropomorphism as what they call it a human way of speaking that we would understand god is saying i'm way above you i'm way higher than you you shouldn't think of me the way you you're thinking about me as an idol or as some kind of thing like that i'm i i sit on the earth i'm so big that the earth is just a chair for me amen and another place that says heaven is my throne and the earth is just a footstool it's just a little ottoman that i stick my feet on relax a little bit it's quite a statement the inhabitants of the earth are like bugs little tiny bugs insignificant little things and yet in god's eyes it's all significant it's just that you're you are small we are little we should feel that we shouldn't say oh ouch he's calling us a bunch of bugs no he's not calling us a bunch of bugs he's saying this is how great the god that you serve is the god that's chosen you the god that loves you the god that's called you this is how big he is in comparison to you why are you worried why are you afraid preaching to myself here amen stretches out the heavens like a curtain he's just the the heaven is just like that's how big it is god can take it like a curtain to cover a window and spreads them out like a tent a place to dwell in and he brings presidents senators congressmen to nothing and he makes the supreme court justices as vanity let's put it in our own terminology god puts into office who he wants to put into office he takes them out he hinders them where he wants to hinder them he blocks them where he wants to block them he allows the media to go crazy against some he allows another group of media to go crazy against others and what it what is it it's god outworking his will to accomplish his purpose on the earth it's not something that's out of god's control there are grasshoppers you don't think god can control a grasshopper you can control a grasshopper god can control presidents and judges and people in authority exodus 8 verse 10 and he said tomorrow and he said be it according to thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lord our god there's none like him you can't compare god to anyone or anything second samuel 7 22 wherefore thou art great o lord god for there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears none before him not like him none beside him he is the only living true sovereign supreme god first timothy 6 16 who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man has seen nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting amen god is the only one who's immortal anyone else that is becomes immortal does it as a result to their connection to him and we cannot even approach unto this light you know if this was said in the old testament i could might understand it even better but this is said in the new testament when we're covered by the blood clothed with the righteousness of jesus christ and yet still we have god telling us that i dwell in light which no man can approach unto it doesn't qualify that which no sinner can approach unto no one can approach unto him unbidden amen but thank the lord he bids us to come before the throne of grace and that it is a throne of grace it's not a throne of judgment but yet he has to make the invitation he has to call us he has to bring us near and into his presence who no man has seen nor can see that's an amazing statement when you think of all the places in the bible where they they saw the god of israel you know it talks about that in the old testament and yet that was merely seeing a what we call a theophany you know the logos an appearance of almighty god you god in himself is invisible the bible says no man has seen god john 1 18 no man has seen god at any time you can't see him because he's invisible but yet you can see his manifestation first corinthians 2 verse 10 but god hath revealed it them unto his spirit unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god it's only by revelation from god himself to the individual believer that we can understand and know him and approach unto him at all you know what did what did jesus ask the disciples he said whom do man say i the son of mannam they went through jeremiah this prophet that prophet john the baptist raised from the dead but who do you say that i am peter said you're the christ the son of the living god he said flesh and blood is not revealed it unto you jesus standing there in front of him flesh and blood he says it wasn't me that revealed it unto you but my father which is in heaven the spirit of god revealed that to peter so he would know the reality of who jesus christ was and it has to come the same way for you and me amen let's let's look we spoke about it a bit but let's look at the holiness of god you can skip a little bit but the word holy speaks of being consecrated or set apart in our case it speaks of sanctification the word sanctified is the action of being made holy in our case of course it includes cleansing but in god's case there's no cleansing necessary he is holy god is absolute and infinite purity god is infinite in holiness set apart in other words he's infinite in being different than all of us who is like unto the lord we went through those scriptures no there's no one like him he's utterly completely different from you and from me revelation 15 verse 4 who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy amen only god is holy you and i are not holy yet he makes us holy brother branham tells us you're not we're none of us are holy but it's a holy spirit dwelling within us that's what sets us apart unto god exodus 15 11 who is like unto thee oh lord among the gods who is like the glorious in holiness we read that earlier fearful and praises doing wonders habakkuk 1 13 thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil and can't not look on iniquity it's incredible god sees us through the through through the blood of jesus christ and we're so thankful for that because us on our own we are so filthy in his sight all of our righteousness are as filthy rags all the good things that we can do even those things are corrupted in the eyes of god and yet it is through that blood of jesus christ that sets us apart and through that only nothing that we can do but it's god's work in us uh the next attribute of god is the the councils of god and when i look at acts 15 verse 18. the the council or the decrees of god speaks of god's plan or purpose that he's ordained to accomplish acts 15 verse 18. known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world so god's decrees are known are planned from the very beginning of the world god isn't coming up with new plans new ideas new thoughts ephesians 3 11 according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord so his purpose is what it's eternal it never had a beginning never has an end so god's thoughts are eternal we'll read that quote in a moment you're familiar with i'm sure acts 2 23 him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god you have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain so it was god's determinate counsel he predetermined what would happen not just in that specific instance he predetermines everything that has happened is happening and will happen ephesians 1 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will god works he he cut to accomplish his own will he doesn't just set it as a clockmaker and and let it happen but he's actively working amongst his people amongst his creation to make his will come to pass ephesians 1 verse 9. having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in him self so his good pleasure that he's doing that he's doing his his purpose that he's accomplishing is in himself so before the foundation of the world in his thoughts in his mind he made his plan and his purpose and set it forward to accomplish it god's purpose is eternal that change is not god's decree or counsel is actually predetermined what he is going to do his plan he's determined before the world was ever created what he will do and god works everything according to the council of his own will he purposed it all in himself what would please him that's what he does and that's what he work works out god's will is free and his purposes can't be thwarted or changed isaiah 40 13 and 14 who hath directed the spirit of the lord or being his counselor hath taught him with whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and showed him the way of understanding no one has no one has this is from the smyrnian church age in the church ages book says the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal if you can see this you'll see many things this is such a foundational quote i think we should all memorize it it's so incredible it would help us every single day of our life if we would get this grasp this quote god is unchangeable in both essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already god is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as god must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he's not omniscient the best we could say is that sometime he will be but that's not scriptural he is omniscient he has nev listened to this he has never had a new thought you know we cannot understand such a thing we're having new thoughts all the time we're battling not to have new thoughts and just let's stay the line and be consistent no i'm going to do this no let's go here let's do slow down but god doesn't he doesn't operate that way his mind doesn't think that that that way he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is god thus the thoughts of god are eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with the blue print he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form but they're already real and eternal and listen to this and a part of god this statement this paragraph is astounding look it up read it again and then again and again and again and again i do i mean it's it just it's something that it gives you the reality and awesomeness of god god's counsels are absolute and they're unconditional it's not as though god says if you do this then this will happen now we're talking about god and himself you're probably going to scripture and thinking about about that what about this what about that we're talking about god in himself god never has a new thought he never changes his mind his decrees are absolute and god's purpose is immutable and it is also invincible immutable means it's incapable of change invincible means that they cannot be conquered or overcome too often in our talk in our in our speech and in our fellowship and talking with people we talk as though god changes his mind changes away changes the road we change we get confused i get it we do i do half the time i feel confused you know what is the lord doing what's the next step i'm completely relying on him we have to completely rely on him god's not confused god but he doesn't owe us an explanation that's the thing that we think is we get so frustrated and i get frustrated you start to get angry what is going on here what's happening sometimes we just have to stop and slow down and say you know lord you don't owe me an explanation i surrender myself to you help me just to be content with where i'm at with what's happening around me help if it's not right what's happening around me help me to pray and have the right attitude but understand that god has decreed that what is happening around you would happen and god is doing uh this uh pastor john piper that um he was my pastor actually in before i came to the message and uh was a wonderful wonderful pastor and i can't say any anything bad against him i really appreciated his his counsel his counsel led me to receive the message to just to be straightforward he's a baptist preacher but he was he is a wise man and i appreciate him but he said god is always doing ten thousand things in your life that you have no idea that he's doing and that's true that's true and it's probably more than that that's maybe an understate statement god is working and god is accomplishing something and i think if we can if we can catch the vision of who god is then that can help us in our interaction with each other to be able to with confidence follow the scriptural way and not follow the human way in other words have you ever had anyone in this church frustrate you the whole church raises their hand yes don't point at anybody so that is the reality brother luther is pointing at himself for everybody else the po that's not the point of pointing fingers the point is that that's the reality is that god sends us trials god sends us frustrating people why because he wants us to have perfect love if everything is just nice and sweet and everything is perfect around us we don't grow we get weaker and so if we can take the i really mean that find that quote if you can't find it just text me find that quote and read it and start applying it to your way of thinking it will change you it will change how how you feel about things it will change your emotions it will change your attitude if you really recognize what it's saying you're not going to conquer god you're not going to conquer his purpose we have choices to make it's obvio that's obvious i'm that's on our side we have choices about our attitude we have choices about uh uh where we're gonna go where we're gonna live what car we're gonna drive what what a job we're gonna work at what we're gonna eat for breakfast we have lots and lots and lots of choices to make and i pray we all make the right choices that's on our that's on our end that's on our perspective but god isn't looking at things that way now don't go and say it was predetermined that i was going to have orange juice uh this morning or that light was going to be i mean it was it was but don't get weird like that be balanced um you know i was teasing brother ken because every time i go into urban brew they're night i love nitro cold brew but their nitro cold brew machine is not working or it's run out or something's happened every single time when i go there i just told him his predestined whenever i come next he says come in uh come stop by sometime and i said whenever your nitro cold brew machine is not working i'll be there by this time it's predetermined you know you know you know how people can get so fanatical in their way of thinking about about stuff but the reality is that god is in control absolutely everything he's orchestrating the situation in your life and he's watching and waiting to see how you will respond of course he knows how you're going to respond but the fact is it's it's how we respond that matters it's how we respond that we're going to be judged because we are making choices us making choices is not in contradiction to the god predetermining what is going to happen it's not in contradiction in the human mind it's a contradiction in the divine word and and the divine mind it's not a contradiction that's something that you'd you we there's all kinds of explanations that we can bring regarding that um but the fact is the reality is there isn't an explanation for it we accept it by faith we have a choice and god determines everything that happens and so that's what scripture says that's what the message says and a real true genuine explanation is not there it's there's things that we have to accept by faith without understanding the actual answer philosophers for 2000 years of christianity and theologians have been trying to solve that problem no one's ever solved it the only solution is it's in the word i believe it and that's not a bad thing there's a lot of things that we don't fully and completely understand we walk we walk by faith and not by sight amen musicians if you'd come i really want i really want you to i'm going to remind you for the 15th time really want you to find that quote and i want you to feed on it make it your devotions for a few days you got it i'll read it again the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal if you can see this you will see many things god is unchangeable in both essence and behavior i'm gonna skip down god is infinite in his abilities there so therefore he as god must be omniscient if he's omniscient then he's not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best we could say is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is is omniscient he never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he's always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is god thus the thoughts of god are eternal they are real they're not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real eternal and part of god a beautiful and i was going to ask you to sing that song after service and i didn't and god just asked
