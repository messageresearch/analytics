========================================

[Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] amen genesis [Music] music's a nice effect but i don't need it you love him this morning maybe he could just meet the computer or the bread wonderful amen let's just read here genesis chapter 12. i'd like to speak this morning and i'd like to just teach on this as a little bit of time that we have i'd like to title this the scandal of particularity and we're going to see here just what we're speaking about here when we read our scripture let's read verse 1 now the lord had said unto abram get me out of thy country and from my kindred and from my father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed galatians chapter three one more scripture and then we'll have you be seated in galatians 3 verse 29 just one scripture there one passage we preached on this a couple wednesdays ago galatians 3 verse 29 and if you be christ's then are you abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise you can have your seats this morning the scandal of particularity is a term used by uh scholars and it's a uh we're not at all gonna break down or get into what it is but just uh to touch it just for a moment because i believe it's important you're gonna find that in close to almost 24 be two dozen places in the bible especially the old testament but also the new testament god refers to himself as the god of abraham isaac and jacob i'm sure you've read that before in your bible and you find it in genesis 12 abraham receives this blessing and god gives him this promise and promises him i'm going to bless you and it's it's going to it's going to surpass and transcend you it's going to go all through all the generations of the earth god reaffirms that same promise that he gave to abraham to his son isaac and then god affirms it again to isaac's son jacob and even in the book of acts you'll find this that god that peter after he heals the lame man declares that it was done by the god of abraham isaac and jacob so we know it's a covenant that god makes with abraham and it's important to us just to to briefly say this it's pertinent important to us because we are abraham's seed and we're abraham's children now not naturally speaking we're not natural jews but as we read a couple wednesdays ago brother branham says when you leave the world and you separate yourself from everything and you're called out by god he said you are a spiritual jew right so it was a it was a covenant that god gives to abraham you're going to find two threads uh that and and they they both uh are connected to each other running all the way through the old testament and you one thread is the two threads i'm gonna give you the one thread is that god is that the god of the jews the god of the jews is the god of the whole universe everything the stars the galaxies and that thread you'll find throughout the whole old testament that the jews proclaim this you'll find it in job you'll find it a lot in dave when david speaks about the god of jehovah that he's the god of israel so one thread that you'll find running throughout the whole old testament is that the god of the unit the god of the jews is the god of the whole universe and to understand that in those days every nation had a god you'll find in genesis 1 through chapter 11 all of the nations of the earth and all of the different tribes and all of the different peoples the bible calls them that they had their own god they they they were religious all humanity was religious they were they believed in something whether it was the god of baal and that was the national god or the god of asteroth and that was the national god the god of of isis even uh in the bible that's actually a name of a god uh was a god of the people it was a god of the nations you read about god uh the god of moloch you've read about that before so all wars that happened were religiously motivated they were religious wars about whose god was the most powerful god when you went to war you went by the with your priests you went with your singers you went with whatever kind of religious things that they had to drum up their god or summon their god israel had the ark of the covenant and it was representative of something it was not just a piece of furniture but it was representative of jehovah that when they went to war jehovah went before them and so all wars were religious between one god and another one god one people's god and another so israel was a nation and israel's god was yahweh or jehovah which simply means constant or always jehovah and so the the the the but but differently than any other nation different than the god of the nations of canaan or the nations of the height the hittites or the perizzites israel made a claim to something that no one else did and what israel claimed is that her god was the god of all gods and that's actually in the bible you'll find that phrase in the old testament the god of all gods you go read the isaiah i think it's chapter 40 and isaiah just declares that he's the god of all gods and in fact they go further than the god being uh in fact i think the word is the god above all gods that's the word the king james uses that he's the god above all gods they went further than that and israel said that not only is he the god above all gods but our god is the only god that all of the gods are of human uh imagination that they're not real that our god is the god of all gods but he's also the only god and they went further than that and said that not only did our god create but he also maintains the entire universe and that god who created the entire universe and maintains the entire universe is our god it's a bold claim it's a big claim our god is not just you have your gods our god is not just the god of all gods he's the god what god referred to the one who created the world the one who created the stars the one who created the existence of humanity of all the trees of everything that you see israel says that's our god now you may have yours of wood hay and stubble and you may have moloch and bell and asteroth but this is our god and our god is the god above all gods isaiah chapter 40 is the is the is the chapter there where you'll find isaiah declaring that job declares that david especially as we said in the psalms declares that so that's one thread the thread being that the god of the jews is the god of the whole universe the other side of that thread is that the god of the universe is the god of the jews say what's different from the man because it's one thing for the jews to say our god is the god of the universe it's another thing for the god of the universe to say i'm that people's god amen and so you'll find those two threads running throughout the old testament that the jews are saying our god is the god is the only god above all gods he's the god of the universe the other threat is that the god of the universe is the god of the jews and they were really claiming the jews that the creator of everything the stars the galaxy everything that you see that that god actually made a very personal relationship and intimate relationship with one family amen wow now i hope you follow this that that this was their claim that that one god all nations have their gods that one god had a personal intimate relationship with one little group of people on the whole earth that the god of the stars that the god of the galaxies that the god of orion and the god of the moon and the god of the sun had became the god of the jews and the bible actually identifies him and god identifies himself as one with that family god identifies and god let me say this way god was not embarrassed or ashamed to actually call himself because as we said it was one thing for them to say that but when god reveals himself to moses god reveals himself and says i am the god of abraham isaac and jacob and so god is not embarrassed but actually identifies himself think about this he identifies himself with a grandfather a father and a son three people abraham isaac and jacob and god identifies himself as the whole god of the universe and it doesn't pick the entire spectrum of the whole planet and everybody who's breathing air but he says i'm the god of these three individual men these generations of men the god of the entire universe was now calling himself the god of abraham isaac amen and jacob incredible let me go just a little bit further can you imagine how that was so offensive to other people oh yeah amen imagine how offensive that would be to other nations and other people wow that you were claiming he's our god we're his people and worthy that god identifies himself only with one family with the one people it's an incredible claim and so uh what what you'll find is as we said these two threads run through the entire bible that the god of the jews is the god of the universe and the god of the universe is the god of the jews and so you understand this by the book of genesis because it's in the book of genesis that you ex get the explanation of a god of abraham isaac if you don't have the book of genesis imagine your bible if you started with exodus you would just think it's just a it's just about this god uh you you would just think this claim is just it's just about exodus on through would just be about a god of the jews but genesis says no it's the god of the whole universe who has become the god who created the world and created the stars in this days of creation has become the god of this jewish people you get that from the book of genesis and that god calls himself by just three men who belong to a tiny group of people called the jews now remember this is just a little bit of teaching here the book of genesis let me just pull this up on my phone here the book of genesis covers a massive span of history in fact the book of genesis covers more time than every other book of the bible put together one book that time has been compressed into because it's going to cover centuries and centuries and generations and generations of people and so let me just find my place here so you you find this from exodus to revelation let me just get that from exodus to revelation it covers about give or take 1500 years if you if you if you study uh what scholars believe covers exodus to revelations about 1500 years whereas genesis covers the entire creation of the world covers the entire creation days of creation the existence of mankind from the beginning all the way to joseph so it's massive much longer centuries and centuries of people and so what you realize when you read the book of genesis is that time has been compressed in the book of genesis it covers centuries as compared to the rest of the bible uh it's a much longer period of time genesis chapter one we all know really well through chapter 11 and let me just if i had this on a chart i would i could show you this visually but just i'm just going to say it here genesis chapter 1 through chapter 11 that's a very short section of your bible if you just if you open your bible and you hold to chapter 1 to chapter 11 it's a very small portion especially genesis you have chapter 12 through chapter 50. so chapter 12 through chapter 50 is a much larger portion of the book and what's interesting is that chapter 1 through chapter 11 is a covers a massive amount of time i mean centuries of time in just 11 chapters and it covers many people just mentions them it doesn't give all the history of everything you don't find the history of every nation and everybody and what everybody did and the record of every act we couldn't contain that in the book but it covers many nations many people uh uh and and and many many many uh in a in a massive amount of time that's chapter 1 through chapter 11. but then chapter 12 through chapter 50 actually only covers a very short amount of time amen and it basically only really speaks about four men really that's it chapter 11 through 11 covers many people many nations and a massive amount of time chapter 12 through chapter 50 covers just a little space of time about four men abraham isaac jacob joseph and joseph is completely different than the rest of the three god never calls himself the god of joseph there's a reason for that there's a significance about joseph that was very different we're not going to get into that today but god calls himself by these three men abraham isaac and jacob you say brother matt why is that chapter 1 through 11 massive amount and all the history of the earth and all the history of creation and then you come to chapter 12 and what god does very deliberately i want you to realize it's very deliberate god zooms in amen and he focuses on one family he zooms in from the entire world and all of its people down to just one family you say why is that important because you're seeing history from god's perspective this is how god looks at history this is how god looks at you may not like it may not you may think it's unfair god was going to zoom in on one family but it's what god chose to do and he zooms in very deliberately on the lives of these men and gives you the life of abraham who let god gives a promise to and he leaves the land of er and he promises in you i'll bless you and all the nations of the earth be blessed and then he covers the life of isaac and he gives that same promise to isaac then he goes to the life of jacob and you get all these chapters about all these stories about all these men no one else everybody else is left out mostly and he covers this zoomed in perspective and god begins dealing god has a purpose god has a plan remember the bible is is is the is the answer or the solution to god's problem not man's problem man's man thinks that the bible oh you need jesus you you're feeling desperate i got something for you it's i got the the answer to your problem you're feeling lonely got the answer to that got a man who could help you but it's it's really the god the the bible is about god's solution to his problem how do you get an entire creation of people in humanity who are disobedient to you who don't listen to you i heard a preacher one time say he said it's amazing he says the you know the god says to the god says to the uh to the flowers bloom and they blew and he says then god speaks to the trees grow and they grow he says then god speaks to the wind blow and it blows god speaks to the rain rain and it rains god speaks to man and man says no it's the only part of creation who says no and becomes disobedient to the creator and so what does god try first god you say how do you you get man who's so corrupted and man goes so far off in depravity and after after the fall uh the bible says that men begin to call upon the name of the lord the children of seth begin to call upon the name of god and those people who call upon the name of the lord are important to god because those are the people who god can accomplish his purposes through and god begins to and man corrupts himself and so what does god do god first wipes them out wipes them off destroys the earth by a flood you know what happens no one gets off the ark he gets drunk and exposes himself so does wiping it out starting from scratch fix the real problem no because the real problem is a nature a lull of sin inside of man amen and so wiping it out and start from scratch the problem will still exist so what does god decide after the flood god reveals himself and god has a promise and he starts to accomplish his purpose because god has a purpose and god has a plan and he starts to very deliberately deal with this the entire uh uh uh plan and purpose of god all the way through the constant me all the way through redemption with abraham god begins his promise and says get up get thee out of thy land and out of that country unto a land that i will show thee and he reveals himself when moses as we said at the beginning god reveals himself by that name god chose one family to bring his plan through the scholars as we said the scholars call this the scandal of particularity and you can go and and read all about it i'm not going to teach on this on the you know the uh the intellectual point of view from that but the basis is why did god choose the jews why why would he choose one people and if he was going to choose one people and one nation why abraham why the jews in our rationale we always have to have an answer for everything there had to be something why didn't he choose the chinese that's the scandal of particularity why didn't he just choose the chinese to save the chinese why did he choose the americans that would save their own self then he would choose the you know the the british to save the british why one nation to save the whole world because that is what god that is god's plan i hope you catch that that is god's plan god was going to use one family to save the rest of the world through one seed everybody else would be redeemed they're one family through one promise one promise god made it to men but why did god choose to save the whole world through one jewish people two two poets wrote very short little one's name was william norman ooher i hope i'm pronouncing his ur name last name right and one of them was called cecil brown two poets who wrote very short poems and william norman ooher wrote this poem it's very popular with the scandal of particularity it's a very popular poem it's very short very simple and here's his poem how odd of god to choose the jews that's it how odd of god to choose the jews so along came cecil brown and he was going to add a second verse to that poem and here's what cesar brown said but not so odd as those who choose a jewish god but spurned the jews amazing so you say brother matt why didn't why did god choose to choose let me give you the most profound answer get your pins get your get your ipads get your smartphones get ready to take it down here's why god chose the jews because that was his choice and people don't like it but it's his choice and and and educational systems decry against it social justice cries against it god would choose one people and one nation but here's why it was god's choice that's why he's calling himself the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob and so genesis just as we close genesis chapter 12 through chapter 50 as we said are basically the stories of four men abraham isaac and jacob and joseph and three of them grouped together one is very different three generations of people and and what's amazing is as you look at these three men there's a counterpoint for each of them for each abraham isaac and jacob there's a counterpoint for each of them the counterpoint to abraham is his nephew lot amen right remember how brother branham talked about in the book of revelations he says that the spirit speaks to both the true vine and the false vine remember that and he says so in the book of revelation you're hearing god speak to both lines remember in the beginning was twins brother adam says there's twins out of every revival there's two lines running throughout all of the beginning of history runs through the middle of history runs to the end of the old testament the new testament begins with those same two lines and it ends all the way in the book of revelation with those same two lines they're not physical bloodlines because if it comes down to physical blood man we are all in trouble all of us as we're a mixture of of of all kinds there's no pure bloodline god's not looking for a natural pure bloodline but there was a line of children jesus calls them of obedience and children of disobedience the children of the light the children of the darkness it's amazing when you look at this even in abraham's life there was lot as a counterpoint to abraham abraham lot then there was a counterpoint to isaac isaac and then his stepbrother ishmael and then there was a counterpoint to jacob jacob and his twin you see that yeah it goes from nephew to stepbrother to twin a little bit closer and closer and closer it's like the relationships of those from nephew to step brother to twin get closer and closer you know what it's showing it's showing as we said throughout the entire bible there's two lines running through the human race and they're in stark contrast to each other and you throughout the entire bible it's an invitation to line yourself up with one of two lines are you in abraham or are you a lot are you a jacob or are you an isaac or are you an ishmael are you a jacob or are you an esau let's stand to our feet this morning i want to say lord i want to be a abraham i want to be an isaac i'm going to be a jacob lord we thank you this morning for this teaching it's rich lord there's so much father that there's so much to it lord that something inside of our soul just identifies with lord we pray that you would take this teaching lord this morning may you bless it lord may you father just continue to bless this service and the singing and the music
