man i wanted to preach tonight so i missed sunday and looking forward to tonight and i've got a thought on my heart that i sent out to you all and want to start on it tonight and move into sunday and continue amen god bless you genesis chapter 1 amen sure enjoyed all that singing and all that special singing and it is special indeed special people singing special songs in a special way makes it special amen praise the lord genesis 1 and we're just going to read those first 11 verses you have it say amen in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void darkness was upon the face of the deep the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning or the first day isn't that beautiful and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so and god called the firmament heaven in the evening in the morning or the second day and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear and it was so and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so i love the word of god i'm taking a text tonight from that 11th verse and god said let the earth bring forth i want to speak to you tonight on bring forth the genesis effect amen amen let's pray master we thank you for your word we're taught in your word and we believe it lord that there's a blessing just reading it and hearing it read and father tonight we stand here blessed and i feel blessed to be able to open the pages of this grand old book lord and know that it came directly from you to me father you moved on holy men in old time lord and they spake and they wrote as you gave them unction and these words come to us lord from one of the greatest prophets one of your greatest servants of all time uh a very great type of your of you when you were here it's the prophet moses and he writes this story to us lord and we realize that all the word of god has a purpose behind it it's driven by the very purposes of god everything all creation is brought into being and has been moved at pace according to your desires and your plans the vision that you had and it's all working splendidly beautifully perfectly harmoniously there's nothing of your word out of cater you're not bothered you're not nervous you're not afraid lord the world falling apart but yet you are you are you are the living presence of shalom itself and you invite the bride to live there with you so father tonight help us won't you i know you will come and take your word break the bread of life to us lord let it inspire the people as it has inspired me i've thought on this thought for many days now and i'm just looking to see how you'll go there's more material than i plan to cover tonight more than i can even cover but i'll just let you be the leader on what gets covered so i committed to you now master myself into your hands humbling myself once more may you bless both speaker and hearer lord we stand tonight may every person i so appreciated lord the the special that the worship leader felt led to have sung lord fear's a liar lord we stand tonight let everybody let every believer rejoice that we stand tonight under a blood-stained banner it flies above us lord it it is it is it is stained by the blood of the lamb of god lord and we stand under it proudly tonight realizing that it it identifies our atonement lord and it identifies our total satisfaction and i am happy to be identified standing under this banner let the whole world see it waving let me lift it high and wave it lord i commit myself to you now to this truth and this reality in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated you know it's the first time you will find in the bible that this term these two words get chained together bring forth it fittingly begins in genesis fittingly in the very first chapter of genesis and in fact is in the book of genesis it's used exactly seven times it's used five times here in the garden of eden and and then after the fall and then god says to eve on the fifth time in sorrow you'll bring forth but and then it's used twice again in genesis and when noah is told to gather and bring forth all of the animals into the ark and then he's after the ark he's given a command the same command i believe in its fourth usage in the book of genesis when when god calls for be fruitful and multiply bring forth and so we realize that genesis has these perfect seven sequences perfect seven times of this idea i think that i could say to you tonight if god planted seed he intends for it to bring forth if god went to the trouble to speak and here he speaks to a world that's that that that's without form and it's void and darkness is covering the face of the deep and and the spirit of god moved and god said and you know what he was trying to get to bring forth once he says it in the 11th verse he says it again and again and again and he'll come and he'll say let it bring forth and this this this this let it bring forth i'm going to tell you something friends you know you can have a pretty good assessment of yourself but of course that's kind of given to yourself by yourself about yourself amen and paul warns us not to do that in second corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 paul says for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise i don't want to make that mistake you know i i let me let me take another step here you know not only might you have a fair self-assessment and say you know i'm i'm doing pretty good others could have an assessment of you that's often times what we run into and a lot of times you get you you can become alarmed if someone's assessment of you doesn't match the assessment you thought of you amen so you you can the devil can really come and battle you uh you know and but but i want to say this friends that while you may have a self-assessment you may have all the confidence in the world in that assessment others may have a different opinion of you and what kind of person you are but really the only measuring standard that has any validity at all is actually buried very deep inside you it's a seed that god placed in you just like in genesis and he says in the 11th verse and god said let the earth bring forth grass and herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind not after the other guy's kind after his kind are not after a different version of this but after what god made it to be amen so fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so so i'm here to tell you something friends god built you amen and there is a seed inside you that is the real you and so i want to suggest to you tonight that it it really has very little bearing what you think of you amen and how how happy you are with whatever success you think you have found in life and you might really believe that you are you are you are it and you've got it and you know it and you're on the move and then somebody and and somebody else could have the same opinion and pat you on the back and go yeah you're really something or the other guy could say no you're not what you think you are or you might even have a low self-esteem but i'm here to tell you the only thing that counts is there's a god who put the seed there and that's what he's watching and are you are you not me not your person beside you are you bringing forth the life in the seed that god put in you is your life moving according to god's motive for building you and his objective for you to arrive at i just want you to know something friends there is nothing more important in this life than for you to bring forth everything god is calling from your life i cannot speak to what it might cost you i cannot speak to what you might have to give up separate join two move here go there come what may stand up sit down i don't know i that's it's not my job to know that i'm just giving you a principle of god's word you will never chase the world chase the wind acquire whatever you can but you will never know true peace and true satisfaction until you lay your head on your pillow at night and the last thing you're going to sleep is you're thanking god and you have a confidence that you are resting in his will for your life and that the seed he placed in you he doesn't require you to manifest my seed he requires it of me and we're not to compare ourselves to ourselves or even to other people we have one standard to compare ourselves to and that's god's word and whatever god's word that's his will brother branham said his word is his will it's not up for you know uh debate or argument god's word is his will period and so because of that then we have an upper we have we have an advantage if you'll take it if you'll take a prophet saying his will is his word your life will be a lot smoother because you won't always be second guessing it you'll just look in his word and you'll see well this must be what he wants from me because it lines with his word and a lot of times problems the problem comes and i've seen it happen more times than i'm comfortable with that people running along in a certain path and they come to make a decision and the decision they're about to make is gonna is gonna completely cross thread this it's not it's not gonna be you remember the church is a bunch of nuts screwed onto the bolt and you cross those threads and you'll never get it you'll ruin it and and i just when i was speaking on that here recently i just want to tell you tonight stop trying to take a a bigger wrench to make your to make the bolt fit you stop doing that all you're going to do is ruin the nut and you're going to harm the bolt so that even when you try to do it right it's not going to go on very smoothly don't do that ask the lord say lord what have you planted me here in the earth to be what have you planted me to do what have you planted me to believe and cause my life to go that way and i don't even need to see what's going to happen tomorrow i'm already knowing on this side when i get there i'm going to want your word i don't care what it is this is a genesis effect this is bringing forth according to what god's purpose was for you and me brother branham in the message influence and he preaches it again in influences in various places and talks about this theme in in other messages as well picks up the story of isaiah as a young man and how that you know he he really got his world rocked when when uzziah the king who he's friends with and so admired and he was he was he was isaiah's hero and isaiah had had leaned so heavy on the arm of flesh and felt himself you know isaiah had a pretty good assessment of his own life and pretty good assessment of his ministry and he's born a prophet and you don't get to graduate to be a prophet you're born that way and so he's already a prophet he's not going to graduate he didn't become a prophet because he was the friend of the king he was born a prophet and his life his life found favor in the king so he had a very good assessment of his life and he's just a young man he had a very good assessment of his ministry he had a very good assessment of his relationships man i'm tight with the king i'm i'm well liked i i've got a great ministry i'm a good person you know happy day isn't it beautiful today how are you wasn't it a lovely day oh yes it's a wonderful day and you know what happened every bit of that he didn't realize here that was the critical part all it took was pulling one one peg out and the whole thing came crashing down and uzziah commits a sin and then and then it and then as as if it wasn't that wasn't bad enough then he doubled down on his sin and he got angry and then he got leprosy and then we find that he literally had to leave the palace and that he had to go live in a leper colony and i would love i would love to tell you oh isaiah got anointed and he went in there with them with the with the mantle and uh and he had you know with here he come to say i'm telling you what we're going to do uh your majesty we're going i'm going to call on jehovah and all you got to do is repent and then and then uzziah you know repented and and they came out with their arms around one another and israel had a big jubilee and he went back on the throne that would be wonderful except none of that happened amen amen the king died in that leper house i i was going to title this tonight and and and i i was even going to use it as a subtitle and then i finally pushed it off to sunday but i'm gonna i'm gonna continue this theme on bringing forth the lord willing but i i want to take a a different subtitle and i want to subtitle it consequences because and i'm going to talk about it just a little bit tonight because here you're seeing now it's not the first time in the bible you'd see consequences i mean from the garden of eden you know when adam and eve are walking out with bloody sheepskins and eve is crying and adam with his arm around her and they're going out and they're crying and god is crying and nature's crying i want to tell you that was quite a consequence from from somebody not bringing forth according to the way god told them to bring forth plunge the whole world into sin we're suffering from it to this hour so there's plenty of consequences and and and and i think that i could have just taken a year and just went almost chapter by chapter through the entire old testament how many consequences god's people who he loved suffered consequences because they didn't bring forth according to god's will they chris they crisscrossed their life they got god's purpose in the seed that he put in them they got it mingled too strongly with their own will in their own way and i don't know what it caused it maybe it was raising maybe it was culture maybe it was politics i don't know what it was but i know that over and over and over again israel prophets kings priests israel as a nation suffered tremendous consequences david numbers the people look at how many was the consequence of that thousands die amen and we find that here the king what a lesson to isaiah that it was about consequences that how that he had really been knocked for a loop by the downfall of uzziah and the arm of flesh he had depended on and had somehow went off the rails and piled up in ruin and it was a stark lesson for isaiah brother branham if you go listen to influences my nobody can tell the story i remember my young hearts first or second i don't remember now which one i think maybe the first sermon i ever preached it was either that or from brother brown's message identification i can't remember this was the first or second sermon i ever preached on influence because my young heart was so stirred brother branham was so earnest when he's talking about how that isaiah you know he he sees the lord high and lifted up and and you know it it it it looked like that you know that ah he could be disillusioned about uzziah people get disillusioned about leaders who fall it could be that he was disillusioned angry disappointed when he realized that israel as a nation was a people of unclean lips the king was ruined and the people weren't what he thought but you know it it really goes beyond that isaiah 6 showed that it was way more than that that seeing the lord high and lifting up and lifted up somehow it caused isaiah to come to terms with his own heart facing uh a deep need that he didn't even know he had amen he'd walked all those years with this hollow place and never even knew that it was there thought he was fine until something in life rocked him and now he's in the presence of the lord and he's he he he's laying on his face this this need friends it it went beyond his prophet office it went beyond his visions it it went beyond his service to god it wasn't about that it was it went beyond his friendships and his relationships isaiah was on his face saying i'm undone i'm i'm i have no value i'm worthless i'm completely finished the only thing he could say about himself i am undone i am a man myself of unclean lips and further i live among people of unclean lips like never before he knew his unworthiness in that presence for the first time he could feel his sin as he laid there before god john the revelator had a very similar experience in revelation 4 when he was called up to see the lord high and lifted up saw one seated on the throne and there's a book that's sealed and somebody needs to go get it and they're looking nervously around and calling for anyone can anybody all in all heaven search all of heaven leave no stone unturned like we can't find anyone look under the heaven go through the history books search back to the beginning there's been millions of people born surely somebody can take that book because if they can't we're finished boys we're finished we're done tit it's over i thought i was going good but i found out in his presence that i'm not so sure of things anymore and i need somebody that can that can i see that one on the throne but i there's no way i can stand and john is weeping because he needed somebody who could stand in between him and that one on the throne someone who could be between the two and join them back together and give john hope again isaiah's office as a prophet was molded by that early experience paul says in romans 7 4 and 5 wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the spirit of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead here it is that we should bring forth fruit unto god listen friends it's pretty important that you bring forth fruit unto god somebody got killed for it amen you understand your old husband got slaughtered and there's only one way that could happen and that's the lamb of god got slaughtered and because of that death at the cross now a way is made that you don't have to be in bondage to that old sin anymore that you can now bring forth fruit unto god so i want to tell you something about your christianity it's it's not just so you can be well thought of or you can have happy feelings or warm fuzzy thoughts or are or are you know uh even stimulation by revelation wonderful good but i'm here to tell you coming to this church being a believer being christian having me as your pastor it has no value if you're not bringing forth what god has put you here to bring forth that's the only thing that counts it's the only thing that matters everything else is is layers and layers of god's blessing but i'm here to tell you something friends all the blessing in the world and all the fortune and the world won't do you a bit of good god is looking for you to bring forth fruit unto god he planted the seeds in you they're already in you for when we were in the flesh verse 5 the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to do what to bring forth fruit unto death now it's amazing that you didn't struggle to or not to bring forth fruit unto death every day you got out of the bed it was a natural occurrence you were born in sin you agreed with sin you lo enjoyed life to you a sinful life was normal until one day an eagle flew over until one day you heard a different voice until one day you something happened in your life and you stopped to think maybe this isn't the real me maybe this life isn't the life maybe there's a maybe there's another life i should be living oh my brothers and sisters tonight you understand how supernatural the calling of god on your life is it has nothing to do with with you trying to be a better person or you got lucky or you made a decision or you came to a church not about that you had no chance no hope you were done you were finished you were flat on your face you were undone you were of unclean lips had no chance to please god but god rich in mercy god sent an angel with a pillar of fire god touched your lips you fed upon the bleeding word of god and what has it done it has stood you back on your feet again now you're a champion for the lord now you're ready to go forward and do what your own will no his now your whole life is about his will when you're born again of the spirit of god the first time that we find it in the new testament is in matthew chapter 1. let's go there brother josh matthew chapter 1 19 through 25 matthew chapter 1 verse 19 25 then joseph her husband watch now being a just man not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bitten him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus you know mary had a part we talked a lot about mary having a part to play in that mary couldn't make it happen it was quite humanly impossible but what she could do was agree with the word basically an angel shows up and says listen you're highly favored you've been put in the earth for such a time as this you're here for an exact reason and here's the plan mary says that's impossible i've never known a man and the angel says it's okay god's god thought of that already been accounted for don't worry the holy ghost will overshadow you and that which will be born in you will be the son of the most high he didn't he didn't go down a lawn a laundry list and say now here's what'll happen to your family and joseph's gonna have a problem and your neighbors and all this is gonna and you're gonna get pregnant and you're gonna you're gonna bring forth in in agony and blah blah blah and you know he didn't he didn't warn her all that he just said you know why he didn't because it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what you go through to bring this forth don't let it matter just say lord it doesn't matter does it matter i don't need to know i don't it doesn't matter i don't have to know if i'm suffering i'll suffer i don't have to know what's going to happen to me i don't have to know who's going to do what to me all i know is you chose me you gave me a word i say amen i believe it let's get on with it hallelujah that's the sign of real believer that's somebody who's ready to bring forth at any cost at any cost no holds barred at any cost amen she said that was her part that's all she could do i'm here to tell you stop trying to serve god and serve him stop working at it just let just say amen to every word let god come in and do his work in your life to bring forth his word and so we find but now mary's not the only one joseph's got a part in this joseph also has a part he can't do mary's part neither can she do his part i can't do yours you can't do mine you can't do anyone you gotta do your own part and and joseph had a part in mary's bringing forth for mary to bring forth joseph needs to bring forth the holy ghost needs to bring forth mary has to say amen all of these things have to happen he he he had to he had to bring forth his fruit of a supporting role because the angels instructions to him are clear now here's what i need you to do don't be afraid first if you don't get that you'll miss everything else you won't accomplish if you miss this one first thing is fear not to do what i'm about to tell you fear not to take her because that which is in her is by the word of god and we find out that joseph had to bring forth joseph had to be willing you you have to be willing you've got a part to play i got a part to play your spouse has a part to play your children hey kids mom and dad have a part to play your siblings have a part to play where how many times you hear brother jason say it in 26 years we're all in this thing together we're all in this thing together friends no wonder we need to love one another and pray for one another and pull together hallelujah no wonder we need to be for one another and stop living to ourselves and live for others and if everybody in here will live for everybody else we'll have a really good life see it's not it's not about you and your desires it's this thing's bigger than you oh my let me just let me with such a pleading heart say to teenagers listen to me teenagers listen to me this thing's bigger than you it ain't all about you've got these goals you've got these plans you want what you want this thing's bigger than you you're you're you're to say you're lucky to say you're fortunate is a grotesque understatement you've been privileged to hear the rapture message you've been privileged to believe that which is going to translate us into glory live happily ever after you won't live happily ever after you'll never get it in following a hollywood movie follow this one bring forth what god has called you stop resisting he had to play in in in in verse 20 look look at verse 20 again so look but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not taken to thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost so in verse 20 he had to do something all right now look at verse 25 and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn now he's got to not do something so you understand if as long as he will do and not do then the consequence will be according to god's plan if at any time you if you if you do differently then his word is calling and you f and you fail to not do something that you know you shouldn't and you do it anyway i'm here to tell you friends there's going to be consequences and god's not some evil tyrant you know you disobeyed my word that has nothing to do with it nature itself is is is built on consequential behavior put a seed in the ground plant it water it care for it it'll grow you don't have to beg you don't deplete it plead for it too it'll grow nature will cause it to grow it works on autopilot you're you reap what you sow and everything you do is a seed everything you say is a seed everything you think is a seed and they're not all good and sometimes when those thoughts occur you're supposed now that's a seed but you're not supposed to plant that one you're supposed to bring that thought subject to the holy spirit and say let's look and see what the lord has to say about that thought i remember that's one of the lessons my dad taught me as a young man growing up and as paul said you know you know you young men flee youthful lust and and and the things that and it's not just sexual lust but it's all the lust of a young man just you know that that wonderlust and sexual lust and and wealth lust and popularity lost and and he says to the young men flee that that'll poison you that'll kill you that'll destroy you you'll never bring forth my life following that get rid of it and my dad would always say that if you'll just take that thought the minute you hear that thought spoken in your mind by the devil he said if you'd bring it to the holy ghost he would kill it immediately the holy ghost would annihilate it on the spot and it would never become a deed it becomes a deed because you entertain it you keep it going and you give it life and you give it wings and you grow it and you water it you feed it and then you find yourself piled up at an altar asking god for forgiveness it's a good thing he's a loving father it's a good thing that i can i can just come time and time again and say just once more lord just once more i've never ceased being thankful to the lord that you know that when when when samson brother branham's using the example of samson when samson asked for mercy his words are these just this once but i'm so glad because i've burned that once up so long ago i'm so glad when a prophet in this day goes back and tells the story he changes it and he goes it's not just this once a prophet says just once more lord and so every time i can come back and say just once more lord and i can come back again just once more lord and come back again i know it's me but just once more lord just once more forgive me once more cleanse me once more fill me up with your spirit and people people don't want that kind of a message they called that bondage oh my goodness there's nothing like the message to give you the freedom the freedom what is real freedom to be able to bring forth according to the seed that god has placed inside you you were born in a sinful body that can't does never want to do it and a mind that doesn't want to do it but god rich in mercy comes down and brings that seed to life and now i can control the body instead of the other way around oh i've got a quote i'll read for you in just a minute if i don't blow through the roof brother dale i thought boy is too big oh my nice little inside joke between me and dr smith it's too big what are you going to do i'm just going to blow up i'll walk out oh my so in verse 20 he's got something to do in verse 25 he's got to refrain from something the result the consequence was a perfect fruit that god brought forth and by it saved the whole world amen by a a 16 year old girl and a an a and uh someone i think joseph was maybe 10 years older at the time i believe his history that she's got to say amen and walk in it and he's got some things to do and say amen and agree and do and not do and here's two people two people god just went he didn't need the whole world he just needed two people a husband and a wife to save the whole world he just needed a man willing and a woman willing to say amen to every word hallelujah friend you you mom and dads you think you don't have enough in you to save your children god used two people to save the whole world the whole world you you tell me you can't enact the power of god by being together in unity and in harmony and both of you saying amen to the word and living and setting an example and let your life and your holy ghost and your token speak i'm here to tell you you can and you must hallelujah she had to do and not do he had to do and not do she had to bring forth her life to god's use he had to bring forth his life for god's use it would be the salvation of all israel she became willing to pay any price even the ultimate sacrifice even of her life think about your life and you say peter said i'm willing to die that's a that's a an odd way to say it and jesus just kind of dealt with it in the way he did i don't want to go in that direction but i want to bring this to you you can't don't get to and can't start your life and you didn't get to choose it you don't get to choose when it's over so i could take my own life if god allows brother adam tried it twice failed both times you know why he failed to take his own life because he had a message to preach and god wasn't going to allow it he tries to put his hand on 23 000 votes brother ram said there wouldn't have even been blood left in me and he said i was re i pulled my glove off and i reached toward and he said and i was saying sherry honey i'm sorry i'm a coward lord i'm a coward sherry daddy will see you just in a moment and he said when i came to i was sitting on the ground crying how'd he get out of the pole who knows how did he how is he not dead only god putting a revolver here's a man experience with firearms putting a loaded gun to his head and squeezing i squeeze the trigger and it wouldn't go off until he threw it and then it went off when it wasn't aimed at him oh let me tell you something friends you think you're in control of your life you didn't bring it here you don't get to end it you know the you know what you get to do everything in the middle you can't choose when it come you can't shoot god chose that god will chew god chooses when you come god chooses when you leave what god gives you the choice is everything in between will you live your life according to his plan for putting you here so that when he takes you from here he's got the fruit he intended when he planted it amen and that's yours that's you as a free moral agent you're here tonight deciding you're hearing the word of god you're going to make decisions tomorrow and i want to tell you something friends go from this place tonight with this understanding in your mind i am here to bring forth the seed the life that was in the seed that god planted so that when i'm done i have the fruit of the seed he planted and if i don't have anything else but that i'll be perfect if that's all i ever accomplish god will say well done my good and faithful child he won't care what my bank account looked like the antichrist will take it anyway he won't care what accomplishments or plaques hang on your wall won't matter anything to god he wants to know i planted fruit here's what i here's the kind i planted now let me see what you've brought me i just want to say lord god let me bring forth every bit of fruit that you planted me to be let me bring forth let me make choices to do or not do let me make choices to say amen let me make choices to give my whole life because i didn't start and i can't end it but i can give the medal i can give him the middle part that's what i can do or not see let me take 10 more minutes you good josh mark 4 mark chapter 4 then be ready we'll go to luke 8. here's mark 4 verse 20. and these are they which are sown on good ground you remember the sower the wayside among stone stony ground among the thorns and then good ground remember and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and do what bring forth fruit they're the only one that does the other ones the bird gets it the demons the fowls of the air the other one withers away the other one gets choked out the only one that brings forth is in good ground some 30 some 60 some 100 luke chapter 8 verse 15. same story but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience the only the this is the only group credited with bringing forth so the other ones they're noted in scripture so so so just ask yourself this question tonight do you want your life to to to to be a mere notation of life that you lived here like like like a footnote in history is that what you want your life to accomplish you're just a footnote you're just a story that god used for comparison oh let me tell you something friends or do you want to have the genesis effect do you want to bring forth do you want to be the good ground that says i'm willing to bring forth i'm not going to be the wayside or the stony ground or among thorns not me i am here to bring forth i'm here to have the genesis effect on my life i want to live at the end time like god intended for me at the beginning it's consequences friends it's consequences let me have my powerpoint i promised him i'd read them this quote before we go if i can get through it not blow up all right you know the title by now you know the subtitle by now brother branham comes in this message that day on calvary you don't have to be lost there is a highway and a way and it's called the way of holiness now if you if you remember i've told you before you see these three little dots like right there that's me um not putting the whole quote in because it's not really i'm just trying to keep the flow so i give you that so you can go read the whole thing i'm not trying to tape splice my goodness but i'm i'm just trying to fit what i want within the within the slide all right so i'm i let that be known so he says you don't have to be lost there is a highway underway and it's called the way of holiness he broke the powers of satan he opened the prison doors of hell listen to this that he's reading you what he's telling you what that day on calvary that day one day six thousand years of human history one day is what one day did he broke the powers of satan he opened prison doors of hell to every man that was shut up in this earth in the prisons fearing that when he died what death would be to him on calvary he opened those cell doors let every captive go free you don't have to no longer be torn down by sin amen from friday evening to sunday morning he wrecked satan's hold on you completely demolished satan's hold on you you don't have to no longer oh man good news you don't have to no longer yield your members to sin drinking smoking gambling telling lies you can be honest just and upright and oh boy oh boy and satan can't do anything about it hallelujah because you got a hold of a lifeline that's anchored in the rock of ages what good news friends i couldn't give you better news you can be free you don't have to you don't have to go that way anymore and satan can't do anything about it hallelujah oh my watch a man who longs for a city whose builder and maker is god i get a hand tonight is that you and can step on the highway and set his face towards heaven because he's free hallelujah man i felt like screaming hallelujah that day at calvary paid the price when you see all that no wonder the poet wrote mid-rendering rocks and darkening skies my savior bowed his head and died the opening veil revealed the way to heaven's joys and endless day the sinner don't have to wonder anymore whether he can be saved or not the sick man doesn't have to wonder whether he can be healed or not the opening veil on that day at calvary revealed the way to total victory that happened on that day at calvary there never was a day like it there never will be one like it it's not necessary no more the price is paid and we are redeemed we're set on a highway not to wonder anymore but to believe and just walk on we walk right into god's very presence and the devil can't do anything about it how many want to walk right into his presence why don't you stand up with me tonight and raise up those hands and say lord tonight i'm walking right into your presence i found out from a prophet the devil can't do
