[0:18] we just resist him and come against him
[0:21] we father we know that you have a great
[0:24] plan for us today and you're
[0:26] going to do something marvelous we see
[0:28] all the resistance from the enemy
[0:31] so we know that there's a great purpose
[0:32] going on lord and i know you're going to
[0:34] overcome it
[0:35] we we ask your anointing upon

[0:43] god bless you we're going to continue on
[0:44] the subject of the fruit of the spirit
[0:46] in the last days if you can bring up my
[0:49] powerpoint that'd be great
[0:51] first but we're going to look
[0:53] at uh this is part three so we're going
[0:55] to look at ephesians 4
[0:58] 11-13 we'll read that and then you can
[1:01] be seated
[1:02] and he gave some apostles and some
[1:04] prophets and some evangelists
[1:07] and some pastors and teachers
[1:09] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:11] work of the ministry
[1:13] for the edifying of the body of christ
[1:16] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:17] faith
[1:18] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:20] and to a perfect man
[1:21] under the measure of the stature of the
[1:23] fullness of
[1:25] christ
[1:26] amen may the lord have the blessing to
[1:28] the reading of his word he can be seated
[1:30] brother brad i'm a little hot in the
[1:31] monitors if you turn it down just a
[1:33] little bit or no no control
[1:35] all right
[1:37] all right
[1:38] so untold trials on
[1:42] the booth and
[1:43] with sound and
[1:46] camera and everything else so just keep
[1:48] everybody in prayer
[1:50] and that's why that's why i'm rebuking
[1:52] the enemy
[1:53] he's been fast at work but we're going
[1:55] to overcome him
[1:57] amen
[1:58] so let's go let's go back to the second
[2:00] screen there verse 11.
[2:03] all familiar with this
[2:07] this scripture here
[2:08] it's the fivefold ministry
[2:11] these are or you could call it the
[2:12] ascension gifts ministry christ ascended
[2:15] and then gave gifts unto men
[2:17] and he gave some apostles
[2:20] prophets evangelist pastors and teachers
[2:22] all right for the perfecting of the
[2:24] saints this word perfecting is a
[2:27] different word than you see in verse
[2:29] 13 perfect man
[2:31] the word perfecting there isn't speaking
[2:34] of maturity it's speaking of equipping
[2:36] so in other words it's like it's
[2:38] providing
[2:40] the uh
[2:41] uniform like if you're if you're
[2:43] thinking of the military it's providing
[2:45] a uniform
[2:47] for the military in this case it's
[2:50] dressing the bride with the equipment
[2:52] she needs to overcome
[2:55] which of course the ministry is not
[2:58] doing that of their own strength their
[3:00] own power of their own self it's
[3:02] christ's ascension gifts ministry it's
[3:05] not the person is not a gift it's christ
[3:09] to his church working and operating
[3:12] through a human vessel
[3:13] to equip the saints for what purpose
[3:16] verse let's go back to verse 12.
[3:20] i'm not controlling it up here so if you
[3:21] don't mind going back to verse yeah
[3:24] for the for the equipping of the saints
[3:26] for the work of the ministry
[3:29] so so the the
[3:31] five-fold ministry is equipping
[3:34] the the believers the bride
[3:36] for the work of the ministry so we call
[3:39] the five-fold ministry
[3:40] but their work they're ministering for
[3:43] the church to be able to have their
[3:45] ministry
[3:47] see so there that's that's the balance
[3:49] there we're equipping the people we're
[3:51] not perfecting the people brother
[3:53] branham says
[3:54] the the blood perfects the bride
[3:58] right so and it's the bleeding bloody
[4:00] word those two things are connect
[4:02] connected together
[4:04] and yet we understand it's not the
[4:06] pastor perfecting the people it's not
[4:08] the prophet
[4:09] not the apostle it's christ
[4:12] perfecting the people but this is not
[4:14] speaking of perfecting in that sense in
[4:17] the sense that we're talking about
[4:18] usually when you see the word perfect in
[4:20] the new testament it's speaking about
[4:22] maturity
[4:23] growing to maturity to full age that's
[4:25] not this word it's different it's
[4:28] equipping
[4:29] dressing
[4:30] making ready
[4:32] preparation
[4:33] so that
[4:34] they can have they can fulfill their
[4:36] work of the ministry because we
[4:38] understand the manifestation of the
[4:40] spirit
[4:41] is given to every man every believer to
[4:43] profit with all for the common good
[4:46] so the gifts of the spirit are divided
[4:48] by
[4:49] the spirit
[4:50] to every believer the way he
[4:53] he wills for that to happen
[4:55] and so through that ministry
[4:58] the body of christ is edified edified
[5:01] it's not just for the preacher to edify
[5:03] the body it's all of us
[5:05] all of us it's every joint
[5:08] supplies something every member of the
[5:10] body again
[5:12] it's a mistake to look at these
[5:14] scriptures
[5:15] and approach it the way brother banham
[5:17] rebuked it in the church ages book what
[5:19] did he say in the church ages book the
[5:21] best we can see
[5:22] is a few anointed ministers and the
[5:25] people just sit there
[5:26] and try to take it in
[5:28] that's not what this verse is talking
[5:30] about
[5:31] he says it's a far cry from what the
[5:34] apostle paul said in order
[5:36] which was all participated in spiritual
[5:38] worship
[5:40] so that's what this verse is actually
[5:42] saying directly what what the prophet is
[5:44] telling us
[5:45] in the church ages book
[5:47] so all of us together participate in
[5:49] this ministry
[5:51] five-fold ministry is a part of it
[5:53] the body ministry is a part of it
[5:56] verse 13 says
[5:58] till until so this purpose it's there's
[6:01] a purpose for
[6:03] this equipping of the saints for the
[6:05] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[6:07] the body of christ
[6:08] it's till
[6:10] we all come in the unity of the faith
[6:12] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[6:15] there's that word unto
[6:17] a perfect man a mature a fully grown
[6:21] man under the measure of the stature of
[6:23] the fullness of christ
[6:25] so this is a growing process
[6:27] and it starts he sends the ministry of
[6:29] the word that ministry of word equips
[6:31] the saints for the work of the ministry
[6:33] for the building up of the body of
[6:35] christ and then as we're built up
[6:37] by the restored and revealed word for
[6:39] our day
[6:40] then we can come to the unity of the
[6:42] faith the knowledge of the son of god
[6:44] unto a mature
[6:46] man
[6:47] but the perfecting is not on
[6:50] the preachers the perfecting is on the
[6:52] work of christ and the blood of christ
[6:55] and the work in the body as a whole we
[6:57] can't just put it out on a portion of
[6:59] the body it's the whole body has a part
[7:01] of that
[7:03] the anointed ones at the end time
[7:06] next screen
[7:10] no wonder they couldn't see him no man
[7:13] come to me except my father draws him
[7:15] and all the father has given me
[7:17] in the roots will come to me see you get
[7:19] it oh how we should love him adore and
[7:21] praise him to see the fruit of the
[7:23] spirit in the last days
[7:25] and the bride tree ripening ripening in
[7:27] the top of the time
[7:30] so that's that's the hour we're living
[7:32] in we're
[7:33] we're to be ripening
[7:35] ephesians 4 11-13 that is god's purpose
[7:39] to ripen us what is ripening you come to
[7:42] maturity
[7:43] that's what this is that's what this is
[7:45] about that's what the message is sent
[7:48] if the holy if the holy spirit is
[7:50] working in your life what is it what is
[7:52] the holy spirit doing
[7:53] bringing you to to maturity
[7:56] all at different stages of course
[7:59] but we're all reaching one stage which
[8:01] is being made ready for the rapture
[8:04] ephesians 1 22
[8:07] and hath put all things under his feet
[8:09] and gave him to be head over all things
[8:12] to the church
[8:13] which is his body
[8:14] the fullness of him
[8:16] that filleth all in all so the body
[8:20] is the fullness
[8:21] of him that filleth all in all that's
[8:23] just another
[8:25] that's like a title for god who's the
[8:27] who's the one that feels all in all god
[8:29] so the body
[8:31] is the fullness of god when's the last
[8:34] time you heard that preached in the
[8:36] denominational church they've got no
[8:38] understanding they've got no concept of
[8:39] that
[8:40] brother branham came and he's teaching
[8:42] it of course it was foreign to us it was
[8:44] it seemed crazy but here he is and
[8:46] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[8:48] god's only provided place of worship
[8:50] says the fullness of the godhead
[8:53] bodily is in the bride
[8:55] wow what a statement
[8:57] what a revelation but it's right there
[8:59] in scripture plain as day
[9:02] next screen christ is the mystery of god
[9:05] revealed
[9:06] when i think of it i just see
[9:07] denominations pass off the scene
[9:10] and everything else just going see when
[9:13] i see god's great purpose revealing
[9:15] himself and having first to reveal
[9:17] himself in christ
[9:19] the fullness of the goded bodily and
[9:21] then to bring that fullness of godhead
[9:23] bodily
[9:24] into a people that he could have the
[9:26] preeminence the oversight
[9:28] the leading that's what he's doing
[9:31] that's what he's doing today
[9:33] that's why we're still here that's why
[9:36] he's working in your life
[9:38] he's bringing the preeminence because
[9:40] you you and i together have to be the
[9:43] expression of the fullness of the
[9:45] godhead bodily not us as individuals
[9:48] us as individuals together in a body
[9:51] will do it
[9:53] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[9:55] now the complete fullness of the godhead
[9:57] bodily dwells in his church the
[9:59] preeminences
[10:01] all that god was he poured into christ
[10:03] oh that christ all christ was
[10:06] was poured into the church the believers
[10:09] beautiful
[10:11] all right
[10:13] next screen and then the screen after
[10:14] that
[10:18] yes hebrews 5 11
[10:22] of whom we have many things to say so
[10:24] this is speaking about melchizedek
[10:27] of whom we have many things to say
[10:30] and hard to be uttered
[10:32] seeing you are dull of hearing
[10:35] for when the time you ought to be
[10:37] teachers you have need that one teach
[10:39] you again
[10:40] which be the first principles of the
[10:41] oracles of god and are become such as
[10:44] have need of milk and not of strong
[10:47] meat
[10:48] for everyone that uses milk is
[10:50] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[10:52] free is a babe
[10:54] but strong meat belongs to them that are
[10:56] full of full age that's that same word
[10:59] where it said a perfect man in ephesians
[11:02] same word
[11:04] a full age
[11:06] them that are perfect is another way to
[11:08] say that
[11:09] them at a full age even those who by
[11:11] reason of use
[11:12] have their senses exercised to discern
[11:15] both good and
[11:18] evil
[11:19] i find it astonishing in in this that
[11:22] paul is telling them i have a lot more
[11:24] to tell you about melchizedek
[11:26] but you can't understand it right now
[11:29] right but then he goes on and and he
[11:31] lays the foundation
[11:33] so remember the message is restoring
[11:35] it's not bringing something new
[11:37] and yet there's something laid there
[11:39] that paul puts in you'd say in mystery
[11:42] form
[11:43] about melchizedek that everyone probed
[11:45] at tried to understand but it took the
[11:48] opening of the seven seals for the real
[11:50] truth of who melchizedek was
[11:52] and how that relates to
[11:54] us to be revealed
[11:57] and so it had to come in the hour of
[11:59] full age
[12:01] so don't miss that connection
[12:03] it's the revealing of the word
[12:06] right
[12:08] in full age that's going to produce full
[12:10] age right so we're in the fullness of
[12:13] time in the church ages
[12:15] so you and i we need to come to the
[12:18] fullness of the word the fullness of the
[12:20] understanding
[12:21] of who melchizedek is and how that
[12:23] applies to us and we have it
[12:25] we have it lord just continue to reveal
[12:28] it to us
[12:31] hebrews 6 1 therefore leaving
[12:34] the principles of the
[12:36] doctrine of christ
[12:39] let us go on into perfection that can be
[12:41] a little confusing they're leaving the
[12:43] principles so it's like oh yeah we have
[12:45] those principles but forget them
[12:47] we don't need those anymore or that's
[12:51] you know that we need the foundational
[12:55] principles we never leave off
[12:58] completely repentance from dead works
[13:00] faith towards god baptism etc etc don't
[13:03] leave that off because people have to
[13:05] get saved and come through that process
[13:07] and yet if that's where we're stuck
[13:10] like all the denominations and so forth
[13:13] we're just stuck there
[13:14] we can't go on
[13:16] to perfection
[13:18] we can't go on to maturity if we don't
[13:20] have the foundation we can't go on to
[13:22] maturity either
[13:24] so don't get it out of place we must
[13:26] have the foundation
[13:27] and we have to continue on once that
[13:29] foundation is laid if you're just stuck
[13:32] there forever
[13:33] you can't grow and be made ready for a
[13:35] rapture
[13:37] of the doctrine of baptism oh i never
[13:39] even finished reading that verse let us
[13:41] go on into perfection not laying again
[13:44] the foundation of repentance from dead
[13:47] works and of faith towards god
[13:50] of the doctrine of baptism and of laying
[13:52] out of hands and of resurrection of the
[13:55] dead and of eternal judgment
[13:58] and this will we do if god permit god
[14:00] did not permit them
[14:02] in that age to go on to perfection why
[14:04] the apostles passed away and they began
[14:06] to make their slow descent
[14:09] falling away from the original faith
[14:12] but in this day
[14:15] we're making a slow descent on the other
[14:16] direction
[14:18] we're making a slow a slow not descent
[14:20] ascent
[14:23] using the right word is important
[14:27] a slow ascent to
[14:29] perfection to be ready for the rapture
[14:32] in the stature of a perfect man brother
[14:34] branham says
[14:35] you get it these people who died in here
[14:38] are depending and waiting on us
[14:40] so this church has got to come to
[14:42] perfection in order to bring the
[14:44] resurrection and they're they're under
[14:46] souls under the altar waiting for this
[14:48] church
[14:49] to come to its perfection
[14:51] that when christ does come
[14:54] all right
[14:55] philippians 3 7.
[14:58] looking where i'm at for time
[15:01] i've got 14 slides left i'm pretty sure
[15:03] i won't get through them but
[15:06] we'll do our best
[15:07] but what things were gained to me
[15:10] those
[15:11] i counted
[15:12] but
[15:13] lost for christ
[15:15] yea doubtless and i count all things but
[15:18] loss
[15:19] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[15:21] christ jesus my lord
[15:24] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[15:26] things
[15:26] and do count them but dung
[15:29] that i may win christ so when i'm seeing
[15:31] these verses
[15:33] i'm starting to see paul saying
[15:35] there's a process going on
[15:38] there there's something that i'm
[15:39] reaching forward to that i'm going that
[15:42] i'm growing into it's not a matter of
[15:45] i got filled with the holy ghost it's
[15:46] over with
[15:48] for paul
[15:49] i got filled with the holy ghost my life
[15:50] has changed
[15:52] but there's something that i have to
[15:54] grow into there's something that i have
[15:55] to
[15:57] win
[15:58] there's a race that i have to run
[16:00] verse nine and be beef and being found
[16:03] in him
[16:04] not having mine own righteousness which
[16:06] is of the law but that which is through
[16:09] the faith of christ the righteousnesses
[16:11] which is of god by faith
[16:14] that i may know him
[16:16] and the power of his resurrection
[16:19] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[16:21] being made conformable unto his death
[16:23] well paul you received the holy ghost
[16:24] don't you already know him
[16:27] right
[16:28] yes
[16:30] but he's saying there's more
[16:32] that i may know him and the power
[16:36] of his resurrection
[16:38] so
[16:40] this is something to understand when
[16:43] you're
[16:43] looking at being
[16:45] made ready for the rapture
[16:47] this isn't just about knowledge about
[16:49] things
[16:51] this isn't just
[16:52] about personal growth
[16:55] right
[16:56] this is about knowing him
[17:00] knowing christ
[17:02] in the power of his resurrections and
[17:05] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[17:07] suffering
[17:08] being made conformable to his death so
[17:11] we our our goal is not necessarily
[17:14] our personal growth our goal is actually
[17:17] a person
[17:18] right that's what we're looking at
[17:20] that's who we're looking at
[17:22] that's who we're looking forward to
[17:24] seeing
[17:26] verse 11
[17:27] if by any means i might attain
[17:30] unto the resurrection of the dead
[17:33] why it's a it's a strange
[17:35] statement here paul is a christian
[17:37] he's desiring to attain
[17:40] like achieve as a goal
[17:43] the resurrection of the dead if you look
[17:44] at the weast
[17:46] expanded translation of the greek it
[17:48] says if by any means i might arrive at
[17:51] the goal namely
[17:52] the out resurrection from among those
[17:55] who are dead so clearly he's referring
[17:56] to something different
[17:58] than the general resurrection everyone's
[18:00] going to be in the general resurrection
[18:01] whether you're
[18:02] whether you're saved or lost
[18:05] but there's some people that are going
[18:07] to be in an out resurrection
[18:09] so there there's there's going to be a
[18:11] special and we understand this clearly
[18:13] it's the rapture that's what he's
[18:14] talking about
[18:15] and he's saying i want to arrive at this
[18:18] goal
[18:20] my goodness
[18:21] let that sink in for a second
[18:23] there's a goal that we want to arrive at
[18:26] that we want to move towards that paul
[18:29] says that i want to attain
[18:32] so
[18:33] again don't get it out of order can you
[18:36] can you earn it
[18:38] by your good works
[18:40] of course not
[18:41] you can't earn it by your good works
[18:43] no what is it though it's a outworking
[18:46] when you have
[18:48] faith without works is dead
[18:51] when you have faith true revealed faith
[18:54] i'm not just talking about human faith
[18:56] or faith that denominations have i'm
[18:59] saying true
[19:00] revealed faith that's come to you as a
[19:02] gift of god into your heart to see all
[19:05] that christ is in this day
[19:07] then when what's going to happen it
[19:10] can't not happen is
[19:12] you grow
[19:14] god is changing you god is transforming
[19:16] you and so the goal that we achieve and
[19:20] obtain
[19:21] is him working in us
[19:24] there's there's more scriptures that i
[19:26] want to look at and i will definitely
[19:27] not get to
[19:29] today
[19:30] but it says work out your own salvation
[19:32] with fear and trembling i can't
[19:36] but
[19:37] he says work it out with fear and
[19:39] trembling
[19:40] because it is god working in you both to
[19:42] will and to do of his good pleasure
[19:45] so we put our efforts we put our
[19:47] strength we put our whole being into it
[19:49] because god is working in us
[19:52] what if god isn't working in you then
[19:54] you won't put your whole being you won't
[19:56] put your whole heart
[19:57] you won't put your whole strength into
[19:59] it see
[20:00] when god is in you
[20:01] it produces something in you i mean
[20:04] really in you in the soul not just an
[20:05] anointing on the flesh not just a
[20:07] feeling and emotion but something that's
[20:10] anchored in your soul it produces a life
[20:15] philippians 3 12
[20:17] not as though oh my i had already
[20:20] attained
[20:23] not as though i had already made
[20:24] acquisition
[20:26] either were already perfect
[20:29] fully mature
[20:32] but i follow after if that i may
[20:34] apprehend
[20:35] that for which also i'm apprehended
[20:38] of
[20:39] christ jesus i love the west expanded
[20:42] translation now that not that i'd
[20:43] already made acquisition or that i have
[20:45] now already been brought to that place
[20:47] of absolute spiritual maturity beyond
[20:49] which there is no progress
[20:51] but i am pursuing onward if i may lay
[20:54] hold of that for which i have been laid
[20:56] hold of
[20:58] by christ jesus
[21:00] so why did he lay hold of us
[21:02] why did he reach down
[21:05] and choose us and pull us out of this
[21:07] muck and mire and filth and sin of this
[21:10] world
[21:11] just so you could be saved and live by
[21:12] ever like everybody else no he reached
[21:14] down to pull you so that you would grow
[21:17] to this place of absolute maturity where
[21:20] it's christ in you fully revealed fully
[21:24] manifested
[21:25] in perfection in your life
[21:27] that's why he laid hold upon you that's
[21:30] why he chose you that's why he called
[21:32] you
[21:33] that's why he justified you
[21:35] is so that you can be
[21:38] remade
[21:39] in the perfect image of jesus christ
[21:43] verse 13 brethren
[21:45] i count not myself to apprehended or
[21:48] laid hold of
[21:50] but this one thing i do and this is our
[21:52] challenge right now today
[21:54] this one thing i do forgetting those
[21:56] things which are behind the past
[22:00] past revivals past achievements past
[22:03] wonderful things that have happened
[22:05] forgetting those things now we always
[22:06] remember
[22:07] the blessing i always remember having
[22:09] kovid
[22:11] and i always remember god
[22:13] delivering me from that in a mighty with
[22:15] a mighty outstretched arm
[22:18] i'll always remember that that's not
[22:19] what it's saying what it's saying is
[22:21] don't just rely
[22:22] on past things past revivals past
[22:25] achievements past successes you got to
[22:27] keep going forward you got to keep
[22:29] pressing there's a race that you got to
[22:30] run and it's not over until this body is
[22:33] changed
[22:35] and we have to reach forth reach forth
[22:38] reaching forth is like stretching forth
[22:40] the neck in other words when you're
[22:41] running a race and there's a finish line
[22:43] there you're sprinting and you don't
[22:45] just i'm just gonna jog through it i
[22:47] mean you are sprinting and you lean
[22:49] forward to break that tape so that you
[22:52] win
[22:55] and he says i press
[22:57] toward the mark
[22:58] for the prize
[23:00] of the high calling or it's actually
[23:02] literally means the upward call
[23:04] of god
[23:05] in christ jesus so
[23:08] what is he saying let's break it down
[23:11] he's saying
[23:13] i am
[23:14] running forward stretching forth my neck
[23:17] pressing forward sprinting as fast as i
[23:19] can
[23:20] towards the rapture
[23:23] why why would he say that why just sit
[23:26] in church and come to church and and
[23:28] then millions of people are going to be
[23:30] raptured now paul is saying
[23:33] i'm pressing i'm pushing forward i'm
[23:35] getting more like christ i'm feeding
[23:38] more on the word i'm
[23:39] i have my own revival
[23:41] personal revival whether no one else has
[23:44] it but i have my own personal revival
[23:46] that i'm running towards running forward
[23:48] pressing fighting putting all my
[23:50] exertion all my sweat all my blood all
[23:53] my tears
[23:54] into what
[23:56] achieving the rapture
[23:57] and i know
[23:59] i can never achieve it i know it's the
[24:01] grace of god but it's the grace of god
[24:04] working in me
[24:06] paul said
[24:07] i
[24:08] he he's comparing himself with the other
[24:10] apostles and he said i work harder
[24:13] i did more than all of them
[24:15] yet well it wasn't me
[24:17] it was the grace of god that was in me
[24:19] and let that be our
[24:21] statement we know our works cannot
[24:23] achieve anything
[24:24] our works cannot change anything but his
[24:28] work in us
[24:29] i believe will bring us to this place of
[24:31] what i'm talking about today
[24:33] you don't have to put your effort into
[24:35] it you just have to surrender to the
[24:36] working of the holy spirit and he'll
[24:39] push you forward
[24:40] amen let's stand
[24:42] and pray
[24:46] heavenly father we just come before you
[24:48] now lord and we ask that your holy
[24:50] spirit would have your way in us
[24:53] lord bless the
[24:55] the worship
[24:56] bless the preaching of the word
[24:58] lord may our hearts be ready and under
[25:01] expectation and anticipation of what
[25:02] you're going to do today
[25:05] lord we just now want to stand together
[25:08] and rebuke the enemy
[25:10] in the name of jesus christ
[25:12] lord may everything be
[25:14] set in order lord may our hearts and
[25:16] minds be able to be focused completely
[25:18] on the word and and on you today we ask
[25:20] in jesus name amen
