[30:02] every one of them give you the honor and
[30:04] glory and they're just
[30:06] honored and humbled in your presence to
[30:08] be doing your work so as we
[30:10] share these updates lord we just pray
[30:12] that you get the glory and honor
[30:14] in jesus wonderful name amen
[30:20] all right so a lot has been going on let
[30:23] me make sure this thing is on
[30:26] there we go
[30:29] and uh here recently uh as you all know
[30:32] brother jason demars does a lot of work
[30:33] in turkey and means contacts with people
[30:35] there even though
[30:36] hasn't been able to visit there much but
[30:39] a need came to
[30:40] our attention through brother jason to
[30:43] mars first
[30:44] first let me pause and say you know
[30:45] sometimes when we give
[30:48] donations or support missions we
[30:51] sometimes
[30:51] don't get immediate reports or results
[30:54] we don't
[30:55] see the the impact that those donations
[30:58] or those
[30:59] sacrifices had but i believe that god's
[31:02] saving those for a special time
[31:04] when we'll see them all and he'll reveal
[31:05] those things to us so there's
[31:07] much more coming that we'll understand
[31:10] the half has never yet been told right
[31:12] but here we have an example where we're
[31:14] able to see some instant
[31:16] feedback and a need was brought to our
[31:20] attention
[31:21] through brother jason demars and brother
[31:24] petros while visiting in turkey
[31:26] discover that many of the refugees there
[31:29] use that thank you that'd be better that
[31:32] many of the refugees there were um
[31:35] struggling they they're the the
[31:37] believers are working in businesses that
[31:39] have been shut down or
[31:40] laid off refugees and the government
[31:43] insurance was cancelled and
[31:45] many were without basic food supplies so
[31:47] a lot were struggling
[31:49] and there was a call for help to feed 10
[31:52] families in particular
[31:54] and praise the lord we were we were able
[31:56] to respond to that
[31:58] brother jason brought it to the the
[32:01] mission team's attention and within
[32:05] minutes we we'd agreed and said you know
[32:08] this is a need that we're going to
[32:09] support just instantly and
[32:11] sent the money right away and we did
[32:14] this through brother omed
[32:16] brother moe means pastoring a small
[32:17] group in caesarea
[32:19] and uh and so brother jason sent the
[32:23] funds to him and immediately he went
[32:26] to work i mean within days
[32:29] delivering food supplies to these
[32:32] families in great need now think about
[32:34] this
[32:34] you know you think it's just 10 people
[32:37] but these people were
[32:39] suffering crying out to the lord and
[32:42] god answered and through your donations
[32:44] and continued giving we were in a
[32:46] position to be able to immediately
[32:48] respond to that and we take no credit
[32:50] give all the glory to god
[32:52] and so here's some pictures of the
[32:55] massive amounts of food that were
[32:57] bought and delivered to these people now
[32:59] the believers themselves
[33:02] given their situation didn't want to be
[33:04] photographed themselves so brother umid
[33:07] shared with us what the food supplies
[33:10] and just
[33:11] different families and that we were
[33:14] able to help and this was from brother
[33:16] o'mead
[33:17] one brother who fell from a height at
[33:19] his work and place was injured and
[33:20] couldn't go to work his boss wouldn't
[33:22] help him
[33:23] he had to spend much money to get his
[33:25] leg fixed in the hospital
[33:27] and then brother o'mead said i
[33:28] appreciate your efforts very much may
[33:30] god bless you all today was one of my
[33:32] very best days when i saw the happiness
[33:35] in believer's eyes
[33:37] so you continue with your mission
[33:40] support and giving so
[33:42] when opportunities like this come up we
[33:43] can we can support them
[33:46] now the other bit part of our
[33:50] another part of it not the only other
[33:51] but another part of our
[33:53] mission support is for supporting for
[33:55] print needs
[33:56] we've shared with you before that there
[33:58] is still a great need for printed
[34:00] material
[34:01] and that is the best way to get material
[34:04] into the hands of
[34:06] the far reaches the jungles in africa
[34:08] primarily is where a lot of this is
[34:10] focused in central america as well
[34:13] so here is through brother berry and in
[34:16] a program that he started there for
[34:19] distributing the print material there's
[34:22] a project that's identified a need
[34:25] it's verified that there are brothers on
[34:27] the other end that are willing and able
[34:30] to take those printed materials and get
[34:32] them distributed
[34:34] and then these individual programs are
[34:36] put together
[34:37] and they're funded by churches like us
[34:40] and other donations
[34:41] and it all works together
[34:45] just a you know beautiful harmony the
[34:48] way it
[34:48] every one of these projects this comes
[34:50] together and
[34:52] uh brother barry says you know he
[34:53] doesn't do much it's it's
[34:55] all it's just amazing the way all these
[34:57] things come together and happen
[34:59] and so here's a list of all the printing
[35:01] material
[35:02] that's going out these are the projects
[35:04] that are in play right now
[35:05] and the church age books being printed
[35:08] in french and spanish and
[35:10] chuchua and malawi we'll talk about that
[35:13] a little more
[35:14] in particular and portuguese and
[35:17] you know all these projects are being
[35:19] funded and there's brothers on the other
[35:21] end to help deliver
[35:23] um so this is just a tremendous work
[35:25] that's going on
[35:27] and i wanted to share with you a little
[35:28] bit about
[35:30] some of that one need that in particular
[35:33] was brought forward that
[35:35] you know brother jason and i both
[35:37] immediately said this is something we
[35:39] should support
[35:40] and so we did we've made a commitment to
[35:43] support that and through your
[35:44] generous donations we are this is for
[35:46] malawi this is the one
[35:48] a project that we are we're supporting
[35:51] monthly yes a monthly contribution going
[35:54] to support this need
[35:55] and so you know you can read what's on
[35:58] the screen but the gist of it is that
[35:59] there was
[36:01] um a need for printed material there's
[36:05] a move for the tablets and and you know
[36:08] the agape tablets and they are wonderful
[36:10] for the people that can get them and can
[36:12] use them
[36:12] but it doesn't meet everybody's needs
[36:15] and then there are some
[36:16] there's some pressures i say this lately
[36:19] that there are
[36:20] people that take advantage of the fact
[36:22] that they have these
[36:24] in their possession and they use it to
[36:27] their advantage
[36:29] and to
[36:32] convince churches that if they only
[36:35] they can only play the tapes and not
[36:37] preach the message then they'll support
[36:39] them and so they're
[36:40] that we know that that's not a great
[36:43] spirit of the lord so
[36:44] there was a move i'll move to the i
[36:47] guess it's all there
[36:48] so anyway the malawi people this was
[36:51] happening there
[36:52] and they wanted to come against that and
[36:54] they the brothers
[36:56] moved to get print material in the hands
[36:59] of ministers that could then go
[37:00] out and share that with the people and
[37:04] meet them face to face preach the word
[37:06] hand them
[37:07] the material that they're longing for
[37:09] and so
[37:10] here's um i just drew a circle around
[37:12] malawi but there's other work going on
[37:14] in tanzania
[37:16] zimbabwe and zambia in those areas of of
[37:20] africa
[37:20] eastern africa western africa now
[37:23] eastern africa sorry
[37:25] so that's happening and this is why
[37:28] look at this picture and i don't know
[37:31] right away my eyes went to the condition
[37:33] of that bible
[37:34] but this look at that that's probably
[37:36] the only bible in the village and they
[37:38] shared it and looked at
[37:39] and use it and so this is why
[37:43] you know this is done and then as i
[37:45] mentioned there's a
[37:47] a great effort that goes into delivering
[37:49] these messages in sermons this
[37:52] is a country in south america that we're
[37:54] not allowed to name but these brothers
[37:56] have
[37:56] message books loaded in their saddle
[37:58] bags and they're going out
[38:00] into the countryside to deliver these
[38:04] um so again it's
[38:07] you know the once the material is
[38:09] printed then the real work begins right
[38:12] here is a video of a brother
[38:16] in africa and what he has to go through
[38:18] to get
[38:19] and deliver this material so i just
[38:20] wanted to show this real quick
[38:26] [Music]
[38:28] that wasn't me we are now crossing
[38:45] or messages
[39:01] [Applause]
[39:10] and here's another brother delivering in
[39:12] his vehicle
[39:40] is
[39:54] it goes on you'll get the idea paul
[39:56] don't push play yet but you get the idea
[39:58] they're going through great lengths
[40:00] these brothers to deliver
[40:01] this printed material and the thing
[40:03] about printed material is it stays right
[40:05] it's it gets passed around it gets
[40:07] shared
[40:08] and but imagine if you will you know
[40:12] it's hard for me hard for us as
[40:14] americans to imagine this but imagine
[40:16] that you
[40:17] get introduced to this message you learn
[40:19] that there was a prophet a god
[40:20] a man sent from god to to set all things
[40:23] in order
[40:24] for this day and age and you only get
[40:27] bits and pieces you don't have any of
[40:30] his messages in your language
[40:32] you don't even have a bible to reference
[40:34] it to
[40:35] so imagine the joy and exuberation that
[40:38] these people get
[40:39] there's something that struck their
[40:41] heart and awakened something deep within
[40:43] them like we all have
[40:44] and yet they don't have access to this
[40:46] stuff to the material
[40:48] so think about that when you see some of
[40:51] these reactions here's a brother
[40:53] who's a minister
[40:56] i want to thank god
[41:00] for receiving this bible i am a minister
[41:03] of the message
[41:04] i i've been ministering but using a
[41:08] paper on the phone and my phone broke
[41:10] down
[41:11] i've been missing without without the
[41:13] bible today i am a happy man because i
[41:16] have this bible in hand
[41:19] it will help me to reach some remote
[41:22] areas
[41:23] where i will need to minister to other
[41:26] people
[41:27] thank you for this gift
[41:32] amen
[41:37] don't don't push play yet so here's an
[41:40] entire
[41:41] church a congregation and
[41:44] very striking to me listen to what
[41:46] they're singing
[41:48] it just pricks my heart
[42:06] [Music]
[42:12] because of your contributions
[42:27] [Music]
[42:39] come on
[42:56] or um this is
[43:00] what brother jason talked about the book
[43:01] of acts church
[43:03] you know this is what we we're about
[43:07] listen to that sunday school if you
[43:10] didn't
[43:12] um we'll take a time we'll just skip
[43:15] through some of these some more pictures
[43:17] um pictures of some of the people
[43:20] receiving their printed material and
[43:23] it's just you know you see their church
[43:25] behind them their their grass huts and
[43:27] where the how they live and
[43:29] you can understand why they need print
[43:31] material
[43:32] it here's some pictures of some of the
[43:35] books being delivered being delivered
[43:38] um amazing
[43:42] and it all comes together like a great
[43:44] symphony just it works
[43:47] and i wanted to end with just one other
[43:50] thing today and
[43:51] we'll probably have another follow-up
[43:53] again not too long
[43:55] a part two but it's been on my heart and
[43:59] brother michael and others have
[44:01] confirmed it and
[44:03] you know we want to do more with local
[44:05] outreach and brother jason's
[44:07] sunday school today wow that really hit
[44:10] home
[44:10] um and gone to the hedges and highways
[44:14] and
[44:15] and so it's it's been our heart to do
[44:17] something more with the local youth and
[44:19] and figure out
[44:20] a way to get them involved and and
[44:24] just what that would be i don't know
[44:27] what that is or what it would be i just
[44:29] know it's been on people's hearts
[44:31] so we're asking you to pray for us pray
[44:33] with us
[44:34] and especially for a need that
[44:38] has been on sister jean's heart for many
[44:40] many years
[44:41] and so i'm gonna you know closer to home
[44:43] what can we do as missionaries closer to
[44:46] home
[44:46] and um sister jeans burden has been
[44:50] for the cherokee people and uh sister
[44:52] andrea and i had the privilege
[44:54] to be going that way and i shared that
[44:56] with sister jean and she
[44:58] arranged a meeting with us with this
[45:00] laney
[45:01] who had responded to
[45:04] an article that sister jean had posted
[45:06] and wanting material and sister jean
[45:08] started corresponding with her
[45:11] so we were able to actually meet with
[45:12] her in person
[45:14] and meet her family and
[45:18] just have a a conversation with them and
[45:21] shared with her
[45:22] about you know sister jean's desire
[45:25] and you know we just the door was opened
[45:29] where that's going i don't know but i'm
[45:31] just saying please continue to pray
[45:32] that's been
[45:33] a burden on sister jean's heart for many
[45:35] years so
[45:37] maybe a door will open and let's pray
[45:39] that it does and there'll be a local
[45:41] opportunity for us to do something

[46:35] think premiere just a little bit ago
[46:37] but we have a uh we had an awesome time
[46:41] at the youth meetings that we had how
[46:43] many enjoyed those that was just
[46:45] wonderful
[46:46] i believe we're still reaping the um the
[46:48] benefits from those services
[46:50] and the way that the lord moved upon
[46:51] brother john andy's heart
[46:54] it was just supernatural and so many
[46:57] testimonies that we're still
[46:58] hearing and some of the ones that we've
[47:00] received through email
[47:02] through text and then those that we've
[47:03] witnessed here in our own
[47:05] kids lives has just been awesome so we
[47:08] announced that we wanted to do a little
[47:10] bit more we had initially
[47:12] um had it upon our heart some number of
[47:15] months before that
[47:16] with some ideas about actually having a
[47:18] youth camp and so
[47:20] today that is a reality it's going to be
[47:22] a reality this year

[52:38] wanted to make a general announcement a
[52:39] lot of questions i'm sure a lot of
[52:40] people will have

[1:01:20] and let's begin at verse 9 will catch
[1:01:24] 9-16 let you be seated
[1:01:28] for we are laborers together with god
[1:01:31] isn't that wonderful
[1:01:32] now just saying that for we are laborers
[1:01:34] together with god
[1:01:36] ye are god's husbandry ye are god's
[1:01:40] building we were preaching along that
[1:01:42] wednesday night we want to connect to
[1:01:43] that a little bit
[1:01:45] according to the grace of god which is
[1:01:47] given unto me
[1:01:49] as a wise master builder i have laid the
[1:01:53] foundation
[1:01:53] and another buildeth thereon but let
[1:01:57] every man take heed how he buildeth
[1:01:59] thereupon
[1:02:00] for other foundation can no man lay
[1:02:04] then that is laid which is jesus christ
[1:02:08] now if any man build upon this
[1:02:10] foundation
[1:02:11] gold silver precious stones wood hay and
[1:02:14] stubble
[1:02:15] every man's work shall be made manifest
[1:02:19] for the day shall declare it
[1:02:22] because it shall be revealed by fire
[1:02:25] and the fire shall try every man's work
[1:02:28] of what sort it is now you're right
[1:02:30] there i mean that this is in real time
[1:02:33] the your this scripture is in real time
[1:02:36] right now
[1:02:37] this is to preachers this is the pastors
[1:02:39] this is to fathers
[1:02:41] mothers this is to businessmen this is
[1:02:43] the teenagers
[1:02:44] listen what are you building your life
[1:02:46] out of
[1:02:48] see now watch watch the results if any
[1:02:50] man's work
[1:02:51] abide which he hath built thereon he
[1:02:54] shall have
[1:02:55] he shall receive a reward if any man's
[1:02:57] work shall be burned
[1:02:59] he shall suffer lost but he himself
[1:03:01] shall be saved yet so as
[1:03:03] by fire know you not that ye
[1:03:06] are the temple of god and that the
[1:03:09] spirit of god
[1:03:10] dwelleth in you and he goes on down
[1:03:12] about not defiling your temple
[1:03:14] so you know you have to ask yourself the
[1:03:16] question today
[1:03:18] what kind of builder are you because we
[1:03:21] are
[1:03:21] to follow in the steps of paul god is
[1:03:24] looking for master builders
[1:03:26] see somebody who knows how to he's
[1:03:29] looking for dads who know how to
[1:03:31] father's day he's looking for fathers
[1:03:34] who know how to build a family
[1:03:37] he's looking for husbands who know how
[1:03:39] to build a relationship with their wives
[1:03:41] he's looking for
[1:03:41] pastors who know how to build a
[1:03:44] a church filled with the tabernacles of
[1:03:48] god's living presence
[1:03:50] you're with me you're with me all right
[1:03:51] that's where we're headed today all
[1:03:53] right
[1:03:53] let's pray father we thank you for your
[1:03:56] word
[1:03:57] we commit it to you now fully in jesus
[1:03:59] name
[1:04:00] amen god bless you can be seated
[1:04:12] now how many claim to be christians
[1:04:16] then you're a master builder god has put
[1:04:18] you here
[1:04:19] to build his church to build the image
[1:04:23] listen
[1:04:24] there god has a all of the anointings
[1:04:27] that came down through the ages
[1:04:30] all wrapped up in this eagle anointing
[1:04:33] and this eagle anointing is gathering
[1:04:35] all of god's family to build an image
[1:04:38] the antichrist a man with all of his
[1:04:41] horse riders
[1:04:43] is also combined in this last day and
[1:04:45] he's going to build an image
[1:04:48] amen and we find that that when
[1:04:52] the bride goes up now follow me close
[1:04:54] follow me close don't get lost in the
[1:04:56] shuffle pay attention quickly
[1:04:58] when the when the bride physically goes
[1:05:01] up
[1:05:02] and satan is literally physically cast
[1:05:04] down now he's already been cast down
[1:05:06] from his position to accuse you
[1:05:08] that revelation 5 and revelation 10
[1:05:11] accomplished that
[1:05:12] because he's now been there's there's
[1:05:14] now we have the abstract return now we
[1:05:16] have the token
[1:05:17] so now there's there is now therefore no
[1:05:19] condemnation to them which are in christ
[1:05:21] not even
[1:05:22] possible zechariah 3 covers that satan
[1:05:25] was his charges were dismissed on the
[1:05:27] basis of election
[1:05:29] amen not that you weren't guilty not
[1:05:31] that he didn't have instant replay
[1:05:33] not that he didn't have forensic
[1:05:34] evidence of your guilt but his char his
[1:05:37] evidence was dismissed judicially on the
[1:05:40] basis of election
[1:05:41] because god chose you and he won't allow
[1:05:43] an accusation
[1:05:44] so satan has already uh been
[1:05:47] been fallen from his position to bring
[1:05:50] an accusation against you he tries to he
[1:05:53] tries to accuse you
[1:05:55] but god won't hear it so
[1:05:58] he knows he can get you to hear it you
[1:06:00] shouldn't you shouldn't listen to it you
[1:06:03] just should say god don't hear it why
[1:06:04] should i
[1:06:06] amen but we realize that by the time you
[1:06:08] get down to verse 12
[1:06:10] chapter 12 verse 12 and verse 13 you
[1:06:13] find that he's literally cast into the
[1:06:15] earth
[1:06:16] see not just cast down nice cast down
[1:06:19] into the earth
[1:06:20] and he in he he incarnates
[1:06:24] the false prophet and that false prophet
[1:06:27] the pope becomes the beast
[1:06:28] incarnate personified amen you're
[1:06:31] following me
[1:06:32] this is rudimentary to us and so we find
[1:06:35] then that that
[1:06:36] then that false prophet preacher that
[1:06:39] pope
[1:06:40] will begin to preach to the world that
[1:06:43] they should build an image to the beast
[1:06:45] and you know what will happen he'll
[1:06:47] preach them right into it
[1:06:50] you see the power of preaching so by the
[1:06:53] preaching of a false doctrine
[1:06:56] he literally brings people to become an
[1:06:59] image to the false antichrist system the
[1:07:02] same way the flying eagle in this
[1:07:04] hour preaches a message to you and what
[1:07:07] is it doing
[1:07:07] he's preaching you into a body change
[1:07:11] you're literally under an anointing of
[1:07:13] the flying eel to see the mighty god
[1:07:15] unveiled
[1:07:16] which then reveals you
[1:07:20] so we're master builders we're here to
[1:07:24] build the image
[1:07:25] of god's likeness just like the
[1:07:28] antichrist
[1:07:30] will build the image of the antichrist
[1:07:32] likeness when we're gone he can't do it
[1:07:34] yet because we're still here
[1:07:36] which means the blood is still here
[1:07:38] because you're the blood of god by the
[1:07:39] spirit
[1:07:41] see and so the blood is still here so
[1:07:44] you have a bleeding word
[1:07:45] and therefore uh god can't send judgment
[1:07:49] and cross over blood
[1:07:50] all right because the blood is an
[1:07:52] atonement oh my friends
[1:07:54] you ain't gonna get this at this any old
[1:07:55] church on sunday morning i'm here to
[1:07:57] tell you
[1:07:57] you're getting a high a high calorie
[1:08:00] high protein diet today
[1:08:03] amen praise the lord brother joe good to
[1:08:05] see you here to find the devil
[1:08:07] amen praise the lord a devil nothing but
[1:08:10] a liar brother
[1:08:11] i got people all over the world praying
[1:08:12] for you brother joe amen praise the lord
[1:08:15] i pray for you every morning they won't
[1:08:17] even stop praying and so
[1:08:18] they make me keep giving them updates
[1:08:20] and so we're trusting the lord to
[1:08:22] completely
[1:08:23] stand our brother up in full strength
[1:08:24] again amen so
[1:08:27] so so we find then that you know if you
[1:08:30] claim to be a master builder now
[1:08:33] i want you to think this through a
[1:08:34] minute i that this this little
[1:08:37] part of this thought came to my mind uh
[1:08:40] hearing brother tim calhoun uh recently
[1:08:42] several probably a month ago on our call
[1:08:44] on our daily bible study
[1:08:46] and he mentioned this point i'm about to
[1:08:48] make now and it just blew up in my mind
[1:08:50] and became this sermon but you know if
[1:08:53] you claim to be a master builder
[1:08:56] then you need to know your way around a
[1:08:58] set of blueprints
[1:09:00] all right you're never going to get past
[1:09:02] the licensing if you can't even read
[1:09:04] if you can't even read the prints all
[1:09:06] right you not only need to read the
[1:09:08] blueprints
[1:09:09] you need to be able to understand the
[1:09:10] specifications book because you're
[1:09:12] always going to have a spec book that's
[1:09:13] going to help you understand the prince
[1:09:15] and you're also going to have to know
[1:09:16] the symbols because a blueprint is
[1:09:19] filled with symbols
[1:09:20] and there's usually a legend but
[1:09:22] sometimes i've been on jobs where
[1:09:24] it wasn't clear and you had to be able
[1:09:26] to you had to be able to go to the spec
[1:09:28] book
[1:09:30] and figure out what the symbol meant all
[1:09:33] right
[1:09:33] and so because we find out that if you
[1:09:36] don't know it
[1:09:37] uh then you run the risk of building a
[1:09:40] disaster
[1:09:41] see and it certainly would not pass
[1:09:44] inspection and listen
[1:09:45] ever ever tradesman in here knows you
[1:09:48] can
[1:09:49] cry you can jump up and down throw dirt
[1:09:51] in the air roll on the ground scream and
[1:09:53] holler call for your mama call a
[1:09:55] congressman
[1:09:56] but if that inspector won't pass your
[1:09:58] job it's full stop
[1:10:02] you don't pass go you don't collect 200
[1:10:04] you're done
[1:10:06] you've got to pass inspection or you're
[1:10:08] never going to get a certificate of
[1:10:10] occupancy
[1:10:11] and so when god came down
[1:10:15] you know uh in this final outpouring of
[1:10:19] revival
[1:10:20] that he sent in the earth and why did he
[1:10:22] send the eagle revival
[1:10:24] to perfect a bride for a rapture but
[1:10:27] when the inspector got here he
[1:10:30] found the building in a catastrophe
[1:10:35] he found the church uh you know
[1:10:38] a completely uh uh uh
[1:10:42] in a catastrophe the schools of theology
[1:10:45] and prideful men had had built a church
[1:10:49] that was basically
[1:10:50] when a prophet saw her she was stripped
[1:10:54] naked
[1:10:55] and dancing to worldly music
[1:10:58] see and so there was no way
[1:11:01] there was no way the inspector was going
[1:11:04] to pass that
[1:11:05] there was no way for that church to go
[1:11:09] in a rapture and without christ who they
[1:11:12] had kicked out
[1:11:13] there was no way to improve amen
[1:11:17] but then i heard an eagle scream
[1:11:20] hallelujah you know it's incredible
[1:11:23] because in an
[1:11:24] age with the technology that we have
[1:11:28] that could literally spread the word of
[1:11:30] god to all the world
[1:11:32] you'd think the kingdom of god would be
[1:11:35] in full swing by now my goodness with
[1:11:37] satellites and
[1:11:38] the internet and and and and education
[1:11:42] and and and money and commerce you'd
[1:11:45] think the whole world the kingdom of god
[1:11:47] would be in full
[1:11:48] swing you know can you imagine that we
[1:11:51] have arrived instead
[1:11:54] to the days of noah and
[1:11:57] a return to the days of sodom how did
[1:12:00] this happen
[1:12:02] you know you know you can you imagine
[1:12:05] can you imagine the questions the owner
[1:12:08] would have
[1:12:10] when he showed up to his job site and
[1:12:12] saw this
[1:12:14] crooked leaning leaking falling down
[1:12:18] unsafe no inspection possible they're
[1:12:21] not going to
[1:12:22] pass it can you imagine the questions
[1:12:25] the owner would have that he would ask
[1:12:28] you
[1:12:29] if you were the master builder
[1:12:32] can you imagine the owner's questions to
[1:12:34] say
[1:12:35] you know you you said you were a builder
[1:12:39] you you said you were a because listen
[1:12:42] we're not
[1:12:43] we're not building a building like for
[1:12:45] you know for target to inhabit
[1:12:47] we're building the house of god's
[1:12:49] presence
[1:12:51] that's why the new jerusalem when john
[1:12:53] was going to be shown
[1:12:55] the bride he was shown the city because
[1:12:58] the city
[1:12:59] and the bride are are in in a type
[1:13:02] synonymous
[1:13:03] because the city holds christ
[1:13:06] and his full godhead family in his glory
[1:13:09] under his throne and you are that city
[1:13:13] right now
[1:13:13] whose builder and maker is god amen
[1:13:17] so what am i today i'm a master builder
[1:13:19] i'm claiming to the owner
[1:13:23] that i know how to build i know how to
[1:13:26] i know how to read the prince lord i
[1:13:29] understand the symbols
[1:13:30] and i understand the specifications book
[1:13:33] that saved my dad one time
[1:13:35] because my dad was smart and he and
[1:13:38] and he had gotten smart because he'd
[1:13:40] been working so long
[1:13:41] and the superintendent thought he would
[1:13:44] get a fast one by him and said ed you're
[1:13:45] gonna have to do it this way my dad said
[1:13:47] i'm certainly not
[1:13:48] he said oh yes you are and it was gonna
[1:13:49] cost my dad extra thousands
[1:13:51] my dad said nope not doing that he said
[1:13:53] it's it's not
[1:13:54] it's not that way on the prince he said
[1:13:57] it certainly is on the prince and he
[1:13:58] went and the the and the
[1:14:00] true story and the i was there and the
[1:14:03] uh
[1:14:03] the uh superintendent went to the prince
[1:14:06] and it was ambiguous it was like
[1:14:08] well you could kind of read it that way
[1:14:10] but
[1:14:11] it was vague and my but what he didn't
[1:14:14] know my dad was a reader
[1:14:16] and my dad had read the spec book and my
[1:14:19] dad said no that's not what the spec
[1:14:20] book says the spec book
[1:14:22] gives clarity to that vague detail
[1:14:26] and he and so the owner of the
[1:14:28] construction company his name was ed too
[1:14:30] he called up my dad he said ed
[1:14:32] you know he says you've got to build
[1:14:33] this weight he says that i'm not doing
[1:14:34] it he said it's not in the spec books
[1:14:36] he says he says he says well they're
[1:14:39] claiming that he says i don't care what
[1:14:40] they're claiming
[1:14:41] it's not in the spec book it's not a
[1:14:42] spec book it's not in the spec book
[1:14:44] and and and and ed the the owner of
[1:14:47] construction company says
[1:14:48] okay ed okay ed okay just what page in
[1:14:50] the spec book
[1:14:51] and brother eddie just said page and he
[1:14:54] turned you could hear him
[1:14:57] okay i'll take care of it and they had
[1:15:00] to pass money
[1:15:01] because my dad understood the symbols he
[1:15:04] understood the prints
[1:15:05] he understood the specs and the spec
[1:15:08] book is like the bible
[1:15:10] even if the blueprint has a detail the
[1:15:12] spec book overrides it
[1:15:14] you can build it by that but if the spec
[1:15:16] book had a notation and i put a symbol
[1:15:18] there
[1:15:19] and there's a notation on page 19 that
[1:15:21] you missed in the bid
[1:15:23] you're in trouble i i've been in
[1:15:26] construction my whole life i know what
[1:15:27] i'm talking about
[1:15:28] so so we find that my dad was very
[1:15:30] careful and
[1:15:31] you know paul dealt with these kinds of
[1:15:33] people give me give me romans 2
[1:15:35] brother josh let's go and catch romans
[1:15:38] chapter 2
[1:15:39] and we'll go to verses let's do
[1:15:43] 17-20 romans 2 17-20
[1:15:47] so paul says to these jews behold
[1:15:51] thou art called a jew and rest in the
[1:15:54] law
[1:15:57] excuse me
[1:16:02] excuse me i'm sorry that sickness is
[1:16:04] still trying to hang on to me
[1:16:06] by my own rules i'm not supposed to be
[1:16:07] here today so y'all stay back my
[1:16:08] grandkids don't come for hugs today amen
[1:16:10] you got to stay awake
[1:16:13] and um so so we find paul says here
[1:16:18] and make us thou rest in the law and
[1:16:21] make us thy boast of god
[1:16:23] and know us his will and approve us the
[1:16:25] things that are more excellent being
[1:16:26] instructed out of law
[1:16:28] see what these guys were boasting and so
[1:16:30] paul has taken them to task
[1:16:32] and you're confident that thou thyself
[1:16:34] art a guide of the blind a light of them
[1:16:36] which are in darkness
[1:16:37] an instructor of the foolish a teacher
[1:16:40] of babes
[1:16:41] which has the form of knowledge and of
[1:16:43] the truth and the law
[1:16:46] and you know by the time paul gets done
[1:16:48] with that and they read that last line
[1:16:50] they're going
[1:16:51] yes sir that's right and paul says
[1:16:54] well you who say you shouldn't steal
[1:16:57] don't you steal you who say don't do
[1:17:00] this but don't you actually do that
[1:17:02] don't see they couldn't they couldn't
[1:17:04] blow smoke to paul
[1:17:06] because paul had been in that circle
[1:17:08] paul had their number and they knew
[1:17:10] paul knew what went on behind closed
[1:17:12] doors
[1:17:13] see and so so this is why paul
[1:17:16] identified himself
[1:17:17] as a master builder that built a
[1:17:20] foundation that no
[1:17:22] other could build and so you know
[1:17:25] it's it's it's it's kind of like you
[1:17:28] know where we're we gotta we're gonna
[1:17:31] have the city
[1:17:32] called mount zion oh that city
[1:17:35] on top of mount zion amen though a
[1:17:38] pilgrim yet i love thee still
[1:17:40] i'll not leave thee through the ages
[1:17:43] when i
[1:17:44] reach man when i reach that city on the
[1:17:47] hill
[1:17:48] oh hallelujah friends that's why i think
[1:17:51] about that song and that's why you hear
[1:17:52] me say hey our future is bright
[1:17:55] i don't care what the devil's doing he
[1:17:56] ain't nobody
[1:17:58] he ain't nobody understand your future
[1:18:01] is bright friends
[1:18:02] hallelujah and so could you imagine that
[1:18:07] that that somebody would build that city
[1:18:10] because remember the city
[1:18:11] you're building that city now
[1:18:14] and you're you're using the blueprints
[1:18:16] and the spec books and the symbols
[1:18:18] all right and you had a prophet that
[1:18:21] came and could interpret the symbols
[1:18:23] could put all the pieces together and
[1:18:25] and and because
[1:18:26] we can't we can't god wasn't coming to
[1:18:30] receive a bride strip naked dancing to
[1:18:32] rock and roll
[1:18:34] she fell off into the abyss he was
[1:18:36] looking for that smooth clean girl that
[1:18:39] come by long hair beautiful
[1:18:41] smooth clean marching to the step of the
[1:18:43] gospel
[1:18:44] and it started going down she started
[1:18:46] going up and even though
[1:18:47] even when she started getting out of
[1:18:49] line she still had a profit to scream at
[1:18:51] her get back in line
[1:18:52] and brother bradham said brother branham
[1:18:54] said when i come out of the vision i was
[1:18:56] standing in the room with my arm
[1:18:57] stretched out
[1:18:58] and he said the lat and he said i was
[1:18:59] saying get back in step and he said the
[1:19:01] last thing i saw was the vision was
[1:19:02] fading says she was hurrying
[1:19:04] she was hurrying to get back instead oh
[1:19:07] i say lord we're hurrying today
[1:19:09] we just had a meeting we're having
[1:19:11] another we're hurting what are we doing
[1:19:12] here today we're hurrying to get in step
[1:19:14] hallelujah and so could you imagine god
[1:19:18] as an owner
[1:19:20] when you get a master builder imagine
[1:19:22] the preachers the that claim to be
[1:19:24] master builders
[1:19:28] imagine who who are building the
[1:19:32] supposed to be said they were master
[1:19:34] builders
[1:19:35] building the temple of god's dwelling
[1:19:37] place
[1:19:39] and could you imagine if they if it was
[1:19:41] up to them
[1:19:43] to build the city on mount zion
[1:19:46] could you imagine god could say you know
[1:19:49] it's
[1:19:49] it's it's like as if i as if i hired you
[1:19:52] to build
[1:19:53] zion it's like as if i hired you to
[1:19:56] build
[1:19:56] the city this this naked
[1:19:59] stripped down dancing to rock and roll
[1:20:02] church
[1:20:04] and god could say to all of those
[1:20:06] preachers and all of their revivals and
[1:20:08] all of their
[1:20:09] televangelism and all of their gulf
[1:20:11] streams and their learjets
[1:20:12] and all of their stretch limos and all
[1:20:14] their money and all their
[1:20:16] their program and god could say my
[1:20:18] goodness
[1:20:19] i couldn't even get you to build humans
[1:20:21] how it's it would be as if i asked you
[1:20:24] to build
[1:20:24] zion and and
[1:20:28] and and when you when where where my
[1:20:31] bride is going to dwell
[1:20:32] and where i will dwell and you build a
[1:20:35] cube
[1:20:38] amen and i can't use a cube
[1:20:44] see as a cube with walls straight up
[1:20:47] 1500 miles high it'll hide my glory
[1:20:52] no one be able to see will be behind
[1:20:53] walls and the whole city of mount zion
[1:20:56] my light is to be seen
[1:20:58] around the world it's to light up the
[1:21:00] whole atmosphere from my throne in the
[1:21:02] top
[1:21:04] and here here you have built a cube
[1:21:07] you've built a church you've built a
[1:21:09] people
[1:21:10] and i can't even dwell there i can't
[1:21:13] even it's
[1:21:14] it's of no value to me it's literally a
[1:21:17] waste of resources because my glory
[1:21:20] could not be
[1:21:21] seen in her and the word hear this
[1:21:23] friends the word
[1:21:24] was sent for his glory
[1:21:28] not my increased theology not our big
[1:21:31] programs and satellites and all of that
[1:21:33] it's all about his glory
[1:21:36] that's why the word came in this hour
[1:21:38] that's why an eagle scream that's why
[1:21:40] you've become a believer
[1:21:42] that's why god returned us back to the
[1:21:44] master builder why
[1:21:45] to build something that brings him glory
[1:21:49] you're not built here you don't come to
[1:21:50] this church just to gain theology or be
[1:21:53] a part of a program
[1:21:54] you're here to be constructed into a
[1:21:57] tabernacle of his
[1:21:58] presence hallelujah
[1:22:02] oh my
[1:22:06] titus speaks of this give me titus
[1:22:08] chapter one brother
[1:22:10] josh let's catch verse 15 16. i want you
[1:22:14] to look at a
[1:22:15] a very common thing we see today in fact
[1:22:17] is i'd say today
[1:22:18] it's more pervasive than it's ever been
[1:22:20] at any time in history
[1:22:23] titus 1 verse 15.
[1:22:27] unto the pure all things are pure
[1:22:30] now now don't read hold it stop the only
[1:22:33] way to
[1:22:33] get this purity this is ceremonial
[1:22:35] purity the only way to get that is the
[1:22:37] new birth
[1:22:38] okay so that's what he's talking about
[1:22:40] watch unto the pure
[1:22:42] all things are pure but unto them that
[1:22:45] are defiled and unbelieving
[1:22:47] is nothing pure but even their mind and
[1:22:51] conscience
[1:22:52] is defiled see they profess
[1:22:55] that they know god they claim to be
[1:22:57] master builders
[1:22:59] they profess that they know god but in
[1:23:01] works in works they deny him
[1:23:04] being abominable and disobedient and
[1:23:07] unto every good work replibate
[1:23:11] that's what you're seeing today i mean
[1:23:13] look look at look at
[1:23:14] 15 but but they they but to them that
[1:23:18] are defiled and unbelieving is nothing
[1:23:20] pure
[1:23:21] i mean they they're not even pure
[1:23:25] when they're in church
[1:23:29] they're not even living pure when
[1:23:31] they're standing there crying tears and
[1:23:33] raising their hands and the
[1:23:35] the rock concert in the church is going
[1:23:37] on
[1:23:38] nothing is sacred to them it's just any
[1:23:41] old thing oh i just i just make a
[1:23:42] confession in jesus my life doesn't
[1:23:44] matter at all
[1:23:45] you're undef you're defiled you're
[1:23:48] unconverted
[1:23:50] hallelujah and and to you
[1:23:53] to you even that which is filthy is pure
[1:23:57] and even you with your disobedient
[1:23:59] lifestyle to the word of god say i'm a
[1:24:01] christian
[1:24:02] no you're not you're not you're fooling
[1:24:05] yourself
[1:24:06] you're going to go to hell thinking that
[1:24:09] a christian means to be christ-like it
[1:24:12] has nothing to do with doctrine
[1:24:14] you don't do a doctrine it's to let the
[1:24:16] life of christ live inside you
[1:24:19] doctor's not the issue you might not
[1:24:20] understand doctrine
[1:24:22] even the preachers don't understand all
[1:24:23] the doctrine sometimes we even get it
[1:24:25] twisted up a little bit
[1:24:26] but it's about the life of christ living
[1:24:28] inside of you
[1:24:29] living itself through you see
[1:24:32] so it doesn't matter what you say it's a
[1:24:35] matter it only matters if his voice
[1:24:36] echoes
[1:24:38] if his voice is speaking out of you see
[1:24:41] remember in matthew 7 gonna keep you
[1:24:43] busy josh so stay on your toes
[1:24:46] matthew 7 22 jesus identified
[1:24:50] that many people will have a sad
[1:24:52] awakening on that day
[1:24:54] watch we're talking about master
[1:24:56] builders many
[1:24:58] not a few many
[1:25:02] many will say to me matthew 7 22 in that
[1:25:06] day
[1:25:06] lord lord have we not prophesied in thy
[1:25:10] name and in thy name have cast out
[1:25:13] devils and in thy name done many
[1:25:15] wonderful works now
[1:25:17] nobody's going to have the audacity to
[1:25:20] say to the lord
[1:25:22] i cast out devils and did works if that
[1:25:24] none of that actually is true
[1:25:26] are you going to lie to god and you know
[1:25:28] he knows everything
[1:25:29] so they weren't lying they actually had
[1:25:33] done many miracles
[1:25:34] and had actually cast out devils
[1:25:36] remember devils were even subject to
[1:25:38] judas amen
[1:25:40] these things work on faith in the word
[1:25:42] of god so watch
[1:25:44] so they said they said lord ah
[1:25:47] did did not we have not we prophesied we
[1:25:50] preached
[1:25:51] in pulpits on satellite around the world
[1:25:55] i flew my leader jet to every continent
[1:26:00] amen see and
[1:26:04] and and i prophesied in thy name and in
[1:26:06] thy name and cast out devils and in thy
[1:26:08] name done many wonderful works
[1:26:10] see luke picks this up luke 13 go there
[1:26:12] quickly brother josh luke 13
[1:26:15] verse 25 when once the master of the
[1:26:18] house has risen up
[1:26:19] and hath shut the door and ye begin to
[1:26:22] stand without and to knock at the door
[1:26:24] saying lord lord open unto us and he
[1:26:27] shall answer and say unto you i know you
[1:26:31] not whence ye are now listen to their
[1:26:34] defense
[1:26:35] listen to their defense then shall ye
[1:26:39] begin to say
[1:26:41] what we have eaten and drunk in thy
[1:26:43] presence and
[1:26:44] that was taught in our streets listen to
[1:26:48] the royal response
[1:26:49] you ready here's the royal response but
[1:26:52] he shall
[1:26:52] say i tell you i know not whence ye
[1:26:56] are depart from me all ye workers of
[1:26:59] iniquity there shall be weeping and
[1:27:02] gnashing of teeth when ye shall see
[1:27:04] abraham and isaac and jacob and all the
[1:27:07] prophets in the kingdom of god
[1:27:09] and you yourselves thrust out and they
[1:27:12] shall come from the east and from the
[1:27:14] west
[1:27:14] and from the north and from the south
[1:27:16] and shall sit down in the kingdom of god
[1:27:20] um hallelujah i'm looking forward to
[1:27:23] that day
[1:27:24] friends oh you understand i want to be a
[1:27:27] wise master builder i want to i want you
[1:27:30] fathers to build it correctly i want
[1:27:32] preachers to build it correctly
[1:27:34] i want you to be the right image i'm not
[1:27:36] here today to bash
[1:27:38] denominationalism it's an antichrist
[1:27:40] system it's going to burn
[1:27:41] but i'm here to encourage you by
[1:27:43] contrast to say
[1:27:44] make sure that you're a master builder
[1:27:47] building correctly
[1:27:49] the only way to do that is build your
[1:27:51] family on the basis of the word build
[1:27:53] them on your own desires
[1:27:54] and you're going to build a catastrophe
[1:27:58] i mean your your teenagers are going to
[1:28:00] have a hard enough time if you build it
[1:28:01] right
[1:28:03] they're still going to go through a
[1:28:04] terrible time if you build it right
[1:28:05] we've got teenagers in here today
[1:28:07] who are young men and young women who
[1:28:08] came through rough patches and had some
[1:28:10] of the best parents in the world
[1:28:12] i mean i get it adam and eve had the
[1:28:14] best possible parent god
[1:28:16] they had the best possible environment
[1:28:18] the garden of eden a perfect paradise
[1:28:20] they still fell
[1:28:20] i get it that can happen understand
[1:28:23] don't beat yourself up over that
[1:28:24] but you wanna you're gonna wanna lay
[1:28:26] your head on their pillow at night and
[1:28:27] know
[1:28:28] that you did everything you could
[1:28:29] according to the word and you built this
[1:28:31] thing right
[1:28:32] and then god gave you a promise that it
[1:28:35] won't depart from them
[1:28:38] and then you can hold a token with
[1:28:39] nothing wavering and no doubt in your
[1:28:41] heart see
[1:28:43] so we find then that
[1:28:46] that luke 13 makes it clear
[1:28:50] that those you remember in matthew 25
[1:28:52] who who
[1:28:53] who they're they were rejected they were
[1:28:55] set aside as the goats
[1:28:57] it's because that their works were
[1:28:59] iniquitous
[1:29:01] and so matthew that's why matthew 7 21
[1:29:04] says not everyone not everyone
[1:29:08] matthew 7 21 not everyone that saith
[1:29:11] unto me
[1:29:12] lord lord shall enter into the kingdom
[1:29:15] of heaven
[1:29:17] so that right there is enough to let you
[1:29:20] know
[1:29:21] teenagers i don't care what street
[1:29:24] preacher you find
[1:29:25] that just tells you all you have to say
[1:29:27] is jesus is the son of god died for my
[1:29:29] sins and you're going to heaven
[1:29:30] now you'll realize that might not be
[1:29:32] true
[1:29:34] because not everyone that saith lord
[1:29:36] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:29:38] heaven
[1:29:38] well who will brother jason all right
[1:29:40] i'm a master builder
[1:29:41] i'm going to give you i'm going to read
[1:29:43] you right from the blueprints i'm going
[1:29:44] to read you right out of the spec book
[1:29:46] all right
[1:29:48] right out of the spec book but not
[1:29:50] everyone that saith unto me
[1:29:52] lord lord shall enter into the kingdom
[1:29:53] of heaven but he that
[1:29:55] doeth the will of my father which is
[1:29:58] in heaven i tell you i feel like
[1:30:02] i feel like i want to be like jesus and
[1:30:05] say verily verily
[1:30:07] truly truly verily verily i say unto you
[1:30:09] this master builder
[1:30:11] he's gonna have a perfect bride when
[1:30:12] this thing is finished
[1:30:14] hallelujah he sent us a word in this
[1:30:16] hour and this master builder will not
[1:30:19] fail say i don't understand my life
[1:30:20] don't worry he's building you
[1:30:23] say why did this have to happen don't
[1:30:24] worry you're going to occupy
[1:30:26] a wonderful life hallelujah god's in
[1:30:29] control
[1:30:29] and you want him to be in control so
[1:30:33] what if you don't get your way take his
[1:30:35] way
[1:30:39] now i mean you know the man standing
[1:30:42] here
[1:30:43] i mean i get it he has a logical defense
[1:30:47] you know as a builder your defense would
[1:30:49] actually be a pretty good one be pretty
[1:30:51] sound be pretty logical
[1:30:52] to human reason but lord lord
[1:30:56] but you said in the in the spec
[1:31:00] but you said on the blueprints and in
[1:31:02] the spec book that
[1:31:03] the city would be built 1500 miles
[1:31:06] square
[1:31:07] you said that and and and
[1:31:11] and and the lord's answer would be yes
[1:31:14] that's right but i put a symbol
[1:31:19] on the blueprint and i attached it to a
[1:31:22] special
[1:31:23] notice of special notice you should have
[1:31:26] caught
[1:31:27] what symbol what what what where in the
[1:31:30] blueprints
[1:31:32] turn to the blueprint brother josh
[1:31:34] isaiah chapter 11
[1:31:36] verse 9. isaiah 11
[1:31:40] verse 9 here it was he put a symbol on
[1:31:44] the blueprint you got me
[1:31:46] isaiah 9 11 9
[1:31:49] 11 9 they shall not hurt
[1:31:53] nor destroy and all my holy mountain for
[1:31:58] the earth
[1:31:58] shall be full of the knowledge of the
[1:32:01] lord
[1:32:02] as the waters cover the sea
[1:32:06] so i placed a symbol in the blueprint
[1:32:10] that it was that this zion was to be
[1:32:13] modeled after a mountain
[1:32:16] and the the master builder supposed to
[1:32:19] be could say
[1:32:20] oh i didn't understand the symbol
[1:32:24] and god would say i'm sorry you
[1:32:27] said you were a master builder just like
[1:32:30] in the early church because they said
[1:32:32] we're the ecclesia god said
[1:32:34] you're really not but since you say you
[1:32:35] are then i'm going to hold you
[1:32:36] accountable to it
[1:32:38] you you you fly your gulf streams all
[1:32:40] over the world and you get on tv and you
[1:32:42] tell people
[1:32:42] that it doesn't matter how you live and
[1:32:44] you do this and that and and and this
[1:32:46] is this is what and brother branham said
[1:32:48] you know you want it he said god sent
[1:32:50] you all the power and the gifts and the
[1:32:51] spirit and
[1:32:52] the bible and the word in his ministry
[1:32:53] he said but you wanted denominations
[1:32:55] you were determined to have organization
[1:32:57] and brother branham said that's what you
[1:32:58] want that's what god gave you now what's
[1:33:00] going to do with it
[1:33:02] it's what you wanted it's what god gave
[1:33:03] you now what you're going to do with it
[1:33:06] you're going to find out when it's time
[1:33:07] to go home that ship don't fly
[1:33:10] hallelujah i want to get on eagles wings
[1:33:12] today
[1:33:13] i want to get on eagle's wings i i
[1:33:15] appreciate a prophet who understood the
[1:33:17] symbol
[1:33:18] on the print and he said wait a minute
[1:33:20] hold on this thing ain't a cube
[1:33:22] because a cube hides his glory and his
[1:33:24] the whole city's built for his glory to
[1:33:26] be seen
[1:33:27] so if you were a real master builder you
[1:33:30] should have
[1:33:30] known the symbol you should have read
[1:33:33] the specs
[1:33:34] and should have known that the way you
[1:33:36] build a for
[1:33:37] a city with each four equal squares and
[1:33:40] yet it be like a mountain is you've got
[1:33:42] to build a pyramid
[1:33:43] not a cube
[1:33:46] and they don't understand that just like
[1:33:49] they don't
[1:33:50] understand the enoch's pyramid you know
[1:33:52] why he not
[1:33:53] you know why they can't because enoch
[1:33:54] built it out of revelation
[1:33:57] there's things of enoch's pyramid today
[1:33:59] they've had thousands of years to study
[1:34:01] it with theology
[1:34:03] and they still don't even understand the
[1:34:05] basic meaning
[1:34:06] of the great pyramid they still don't
[1:34:09] even understand that's that
[1:34:10] it didn't get kept because they rejected
[1:34:13] the word of god hallelujah
[1:34:15] but they they missed the fact that god
[1:34:17] is coming down to cap
[1:34:18] his church i'm here to tell you it took
[1:34:20] a profit to build the symbol
[1:34:22] it took a profit to interpret the symbol
[1:34:25] hallelujah and i'm glad today we had an
[1:34:29] eagle anointing that can interpret the
[1:34:31] symbols
[1:34:32] who understands the specifications
[1:34:36] see so you should have known that
[1:34:41] now i've got a city i can't use and my
[1:34:43] bride has no home to live in
[1:34:46] can you imagine the kind of fix you'd be
[1:34:49] in
[1:34:51] as a master builder standing there with
[1:34:53] the owner
[1:34:54] and he's saying i can't even use this
[1:35:01] it reminds me of the man matthew chapter
[1:35:03] 22
[1:35:05] verse 10. it reminds me of the man who
[1:35:08] stood speechless in the presence of the
[1:35:10] king
[1:35:11] and he says matthew 22 verse 10 to 14 so
[1:35:14] those servants went out into the
[1:35:16] highways and gathered together all
[1:35:18] as many as they found both good and bad
[1:35:22] and the wedding was furnished with
[1:35:24] guests and when the king came in to see
[1:35:27] the guest he saw there a man which had
[1:35:29] not on a wedding garment see the prophet
[1:35:32] is what brought us our wedding garment
[1:35:33] he's dressed the bride in the garments
[1:35:35] of the word
[1:35:36] and he saith unto him friend how camest
[1:35:39] thou in hither
[1:35:41] not having a wedding garment and he was
[1:35:44] speechless
[1:35:47] he was speechless just think about that
[1:35:50] the man stood there just
[1:35:59] what will they say when you live the
[1:36:02] life every day
[1:36:03] what will they say when they're they can
[1:36:05] get on the internet and see this message
[1:36:07] spread around the world
[1:36:08] what will they say when they see videos
[1:36:10] like brother george showed today
[1:36:12] and in the in the dark jungles of africa
[1:36:14] you've got african brothers and sisters
[1:36:16] just like you and me raising their hands
[1:36:18] singing oh come and dine the masters
[1:36:21] call have come and dine oh we're part of
[1:36:23] that family friends
[1:36:24] what will they say this message this
[1:36:26] thing wasn't done in a corner
[1:36:28] god sent a master builder at the end
[1:36:30] time who understood the master builder
[1:36:32] at the beginning
[1:36:33] he understood the prince he understood
[1:36:35] the symbols he understood
[1:36:37] the specifications let us be glad and
[1:36:40] rejoice
[1:36:41] for the bride hath made herself ready
[1:36:44] hallelujah the marriage of the lamb has
[1:36:46] come then said the king to the servants
[1:36:48] bind to man and foot
[1:36:50] take him away and cast him into outer
[1:36:52] darkness there shall be weeping and
[1:36:53] gnashing of teeth
[1:36:54] for many are called but few are chosen
[1:36:58] see so we see that
[1:37:02] that god's whole purpose was that
[1:37:06] this symbol in the scripture was was
[1:37:08] showing that those walls would have to
[1:37:10] be angled
[1:37:11] see and because then if they're if their
[1:37:14] brother brown said they lean
[1:37:16] and then if that's if that's the case
[1:37:19] then if you lean them 60 degrees to to
[1:37:21] make it a pyramid
[1:37:22] then you've got about the top 140 miles
[1:37:25] or so
[1:37:26] of the city visible
[1:37:29] above it you understand if you can
[1:37:31] picture that in your mind i did the math
[1:37:33] it's got about 140 because but if you
[1:37:35] were standing inside of the mountain
[1:37:37] and looking straight up like like a
[1:37:38] stove pipe it it's gonna
[1:37:40] you know if you if you lean the wall and
[1:37:42] i in that fact is in my old drawings i
[1:37:44] used to have the walls leaning all the
[1:37:46] way over and closing at the top
[1:37:47] and i realized when i thought i said
[1:37:48] wait a minute you wouldn't see his
[1:37:50] throne you wouldn't see his glory his
[1:37:51] lights to shine all over the world
[1:37:53] and so you realize that the walls do
[1:37:55] lean they go up
[1:37:56] 1500 miles but they lean over which
[1:37:59] which means they
[1:38:00] max out at about 360 miles
[1:38:03] several times higher than the than the
[1:38:05] international space station flies
[1:38:09] and then above that about 140 more miles
[1:38:12] friends
[1:38:13] of the city and the glory of god with
[1:38:15] the throne oh
[1:38:17] my and his glory lighting the atmosphere
[1:38:20] of the entire world
[1:38:22] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:38:23] you're headed something you have not run
[1:38:25] in vain you have not
[1:38:27] believed cunningly devised tales this is
[1:38:29] the most glorious
[1:38:31] we are coming to the end of man's six
[1:38:33] thousand year run in a fallen condition
[1:38:36] and god's going to recycle the whole
[1:38:37] thing and set up a millennial world
[1:38:40] and then and then as as if that's not
[1:38:42] good enough
[1:38:43] get a thousand years of indescribable
[1:38:45] joy and happiness and then he's gonna
[1:38:46] build a whole brand new heavens and
[1:38:48] earth
[1:38:49] hallelujah and that man that mountain
[1:38:51] will push
[1:38:52] up 1500 miles high oh my and you know
[1:38:55] what it's like brother brandon when he
[1:38:56] tore the top of that pyramid
[1:38:58] that mountain off and and i was saying
[1:39:00] to you wednesday
[1:39:01] you can't you can't go to google maps
[1:39:03] and find this mountain
[1:39:04] because this google don't know where
[1:39:06] this mountain is this mountain is in a
[1:39:08] spiritual realm
[1:39:09] and he tore that off and he said no
[1:39:11] sunlight has ever shown on this before
[1:39:13] i'm here to tell you
[1:39:14] when the mount of olives cleaves to the
[1:39:15] left and the right and that mountain
[1:39:17] pushes up
[1:39:17] it's going to be virgin soil to receive
[1:39:20] a virgin pride
[1:39:21] hallelujah nothing has ever no one has
[1:39:24] ever seen the likes of
[1:39:26] what's coming hallelujah
[1:39:30] oh my and the whole thing could have
[1:39:33] been fixed
[1:39:35] every master builder
[1:39:38] could have ended well if he would have
[1:39:41] just been able to conquer his own self
[1:39:44] and humble himself with pride
[1:39:47] and that's what that's really the
[1:39:49] downfall
[1:39:50] people want their way brother branham
[1:39:52] says and humble thyself people want
[1:39:54] power really they don't know what power
[1:39:55] is
[1:39:56] see they don't really know what goes
[1:39:58] with it the way up is down
[1:40:00] always see if you want power
[1:40:03] see how humble you can get now
[1:40:06] we're not just talking about put a sad
[1:40:08] face and put on a potato sack and walk
[1:40:10] around with your head down
[1:40:13] the jews tried that they put dirt on
[1:40:15] their head and ropes on their head and
[1:40:16] show their humility
[1:40:18] jesus rebuked them as hypocrites
[1:40:21] couldn't even they even one of their
[1:40:23] prayers heard my goodness
[1:40:25] and you know and they had the audacity
[1:40:28] to stand in front of publicans and call
[1:40:29] them out and say lord i'm glad i'm not
[1:40:31] like this publican
[1:40:32] i'm glad i'm a righteous man oh my
[1:40:34] goodness no wonder their destruction was
[1:40:37] due them and jesus called the humble
[1:40:42] who were willing to lay down their life
[1:40:44] and who were willing to say
[1:40:45] not my will but thine be done i'm here
[1:40:47] to tell you something friends that's
[1:40:49] what i'm doing as a master builder i'm
[1:40:50] trying to get you
[1:40:52] i can't build you he can i've just my
[1:40:54] preaching is to try to get you to humble
[1:40:56] yourself to the word of god
[1:40:58] and and and and say lord let your word
[1:41:01] guide my life
[1:41:03] let the word teach you how to be a dad
[1:41:05] teach you how to be a mom teach you how
[1:41:07] to be a teenager teach you how to be a
[1:41:09] married
[1:41:09] young older uh to be an overcomer
[1:41:13] you've got to humble yourself to that
[1:41:16] see
[1:41:17] and he says just get away from all your
[1:41:21] worldly thinking
[1:41:22] and humble yourself before god
[1:41:27] then you've got more power than the man
[1:41:30] that runs all over the building and
[1:41:32] makes a big lot of noise see
[1:41:34] because you have been able to conquer
[1:41:38] yourself
[1:41:41] over 26 years of pastoring one of the
[1:41:45] most repeatable lines that i've had to
[1:41:47] use
[1:41:47] in counseling is brother sister you need
[1:41:51] to get over yourself
[1:41:54] i've had to use that line more than
[1:41:56] singly more than any other single line
[1:41:59] brother sister the problem you know and
[1:42:02] and you have to look them in the eye and
[1:42:03] say have you ever considered that the
[1:42:05] problem may be within you
[1:42:08] and you're looking for somebody to blame
[1:42:09] and you got a chip on your shoulder and
[1:42:11] you just need to get over yourself
[1:42:13] humble yourself before god see that's
[1:42:16] what makes us a family
[1:42:18] because none of us are trying to you
[1:42:21] know the bible says
[1:42:22] care about the needs of the other person
[1:42:24] not yourself and then they'll care about
[1:42:26] your needs and then this is what makes
[1:42:28] god happy this is what makes us a family
[1:42:30] see so brother branham talks about
[1:42:34] you know running without a message
[1:42:36] running without a message
[1:42:38] you i i don't have time to to to to turn
[1:42:41] to
[1:42:42] it but uh let me just take my last 15
[1:42:45] minutes and
[1:42:46] give me second samuel 18. i'm gonna just
[1:42:49] take these 15 minutes and wrap it up
[1:42:52] while we're finding second samuel 18.
[1:42:55] brother branham makes these statements
[1:42:57] from go tell
[1:42:58] now listen now let's listen to this you
[1:43:00] got 15 more minutes
[1:43:02] all right so he says
[1:43:06] he says
[1:43:10] a nation or a people that denies jesus
[1:43:12] christ to be the son of god and stands
[1:43:13] in the face of our most challenging
[1:43:15] ministers of today
[1:43:16] and then in our great church league
[1:43:18] finding some 30 communist packing papers
[1:43:20] for 20 or 30 years
[1:43:21] and they're members of the communist
[1:43:22] party this is 1960.
[1:43:24] in our united churches what can we do it
[1:43:27] shows
[1:43:28] now here's what brother branham said
[1:43:29] that's a brother branham wasn't actually
[1:43:31] preaching against that he was
[1:43:32] saying that hey that's like a barometer
[1:43:34] there's something there you need
[1:43:36] it's showing you something when we see
[1:43:39] ministers
[1:43:40] and important people who have actually
[1:43:42] been living a false life
[1:43:44] that's not the focus the focus is what
[1:43:46] that's showing you what's it showing us
[1:43:47] prophet
[1:43:48] it's showing you he said it shows they
[1:43:50] have run without a message
[1:43:53] selling out the very birthrights of the
[1:43:54] nation selling out the regular
[1:43:56] birthrights of the church
[1:43:58] he goes on he says it's come to a
[1:43:59] showdown it's come to a place that the
[1:44:01] little church that's believed the
[1:44:02] message and stood on both feet
[1:44:04] with their eyes centered on the cross in
[1:44:06] their heart and resurrection of jesus
[1:44:08] christ burning
[1:44:08] it's come to a place where the nations
[1:44:11] has got to recognize it's a showdown no
[1:44:12] wonder that the churches when the
[1:44:14] council of churches
[1:44:16] it's so honeycombed no wonder with
[1:44:19] communism and it talks about the sin
[1:44:21] and the different things that are there
[1:44:23] and and this was 1960s when most
[1:44:25] churches still looked pretty decent
[1:44:27] they weren't the they weren't the tables
[1:44:29] quite full of vomit that we see today
[1:44:32] so that's uncouth i'm quoting scripture
[1:44:34] i'm sorry
[1:44:35] i don't clean up my language you know
[1:44:37] just because it's 20 21. i'm still going
[1:44:39] to quote the scripture
[1:44:41] bible says the tables are full of vomit
[1:44:44] see
[1:44:44] and like a dog that returns to it like a
[1:44:46] hog goes back to its
[1:44:48] to its wallows so so we find that
[1:44:51] he says it's honeycomb no wonder they
[1:44:54] can't believe in the supernatural no
[1:44:56] wonder they can't believe in divine
[1:44:57] healing
[1:44:58] they don't have any message in their
[1:45:00] heart no matter how hard they're running
[1:45:03] no matter how hard they're running if
[1:45:06] the holy ghost comes into a man's heart
[1:45:07] he'll believe that jesus christ is
[1:45:09] raised from dead he's alive in him to do
[1:45:11] and to do the will that he come to do
[1:45:14] the will the will of god through the
[1:45:16] man's life
[1:45:18] see that's how you know if you're born
[1:45:20] again because his will can be
[1:45:22] accomplished through your life
[1:45:24] you're out of the way you're out of the
[1:45:27] way
[1:45:28] as long as you're still just making god
[1:45:31] a convenience
[1:45:33] then then god doesn't have sway in your
[1:45:35] life i'm not saying you're not a child
[1:45:37] of god i'm just saying
[1:45:38] you better find a prayer closet
[1:45:40] somewhere and and get over yourself
[1:45:44] and let christ set the priorities
[1:45:47] listen to me teenagers you young men
[1:45:49] especially young men
[1:45:51] start today let christ and the
[1:45:54] principles of his word
[1:45:56] guide your life if if you see me
[1:46:00] being less than i should if you see your
[1:46:02] parents being less than they should
[1:46:04] i promise you this will never be less
[1:46:06] than it should
[1:46:08] this this set of blueprints will guide
[1:46:10] you home
[1:46:11] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:46:15] and he says the trouble is we run
[1:46:18] we go without a message we go with
[1:46:21] theology
[1:46:22] isn't that amazing so they go with
[1:46:24] theology but that's not a message
[1:46:27] see we go with some kind of church
[1:46:29] interpretation of the scriptures
[1:46:32] we've got to go with the resurrection
[1:46:34] see
[1:46:36] so second samuel is an interesting story
[1:46:40] now let me just tell it to you so we
[1:46:42] don't read it all and i'll i'll i'll
[1:46:43] maybe
[1:46:44] read read read parts of it but ii
[1:46:47] samuel is the story when if you'll
[1:46:50] remember in second channel 18
[1:46:52] is when absalom has
[1:46:55] created insurrection and he's coming and
[1:46:59] joab is there and
[1:47:00] and david has got to go and they've got
[1:47:02] to have this battle to see
[1:47:03] who's going to rule so that chapter 18
[1:47:06] is absalom's death now it's interesting
[1:47:07] because
[1:47:08] when the battle gets ready to start
[1:47:11] david takes
[1:47:12] joab and abhishei and joab's brother
[1:47:16] zariah i think maybe and he says now
[1:47:20] for my sake for my sake be kind to the
[1:47:23] young man absalom
[1:47:25] and so you know and so they the battle
[1:47:27] here they go
[1:47:28] and away they go and the battle and
[1:47:30] absalom is on his mount
[1:47:32] and he's charging into battle and he had
[1:47:34] beautiful beautiful hair
[1:47:36] you know beautiful hair has had the most
[1:47:37] beautiful head of hair in
[1:47:39] in the land is noted for it he's a very
[1:47:41] gorgeous man
[1:47:42] and he rides his mount under a
[1:47:46] a tree and the thicket of the tree
[1:47:48] caught and tangled his hair
[1:47:50] so bad that it suspended him and the
[1:47:52] mount rode out from underneath him and
[1:47:54] kept going
[1:47:55] and there he is hanging between heaven
[1:47:57] and earth by his hair
[1:47:59] and he can't free it and he's you know
[1:48:01] for whatever reason he couldn't detangle
[1:48:04] himself he couldn't i don't know why i
[1:48:05] didn't get a knife or a sword apparently
[1:48:07] for some reason i don't know maybe lost
[1:48:08] it in battle
[1:48:09] but anyway so a man comes by riding by
[1:48:12] an israelite under david's command
[1:48:15] i got everybody's attention please make
[1:48:17] sure i got your attention
[1:48:19] and so so we find that that he
[1:48:22] he he he sees absalom and he goes to
[1:48:25] joab and he says hey
[1:48:27] i saw absalom hanging in a tree and job
[1:48:30] says why don't you kill him
[1:48:31] he said i gave you i'd have gave you
[1:48:34] this many shackles of silver
[1:48:35] he said if you'd have gave me a thousand
[1:48:37] shekels of silver i wouldn't have killed
[1:48:38] him he said because the king
[1:48:40] said to not harm him and joab basically
[1:48:43] said well that might work for you but
[1:48:45] that don't work for me
[1:48:46] and he grabbed three darts and went and
[1:48:47] slew him he said where's he at and he
[1:48:49] told him and joy killed him immediately
[1:48:51] and then joab's men they cut him down
[1:48:53] and then beat him and stoned him and
[1:48:55] buried him and piled stones on top of
[1:48:57] him so
[1:48:58] so much was the venom that they had
[1:49:01] toward this man who had
[1:49:02] who had done that to david and tried to
[1:49:04] take his throne
[1:49:06] and so so now there there comes a battle
[1:49:09] and and so now it's over and here comes
[1:49:13] a man and let me pick up where i want to
[1:49:15] read
[1:49:16] um order what i want to read
[1:49:19] and cast him into okay verse 18.
[1:49:22] now absalom in his lifetime had taken
[1:49:24] and reared up for himself a pillar which
[1:49:26] is in the kings dale for he said
[1:49:27] i have no son to keep my name in
[1:49:29] remembrance and he called the pillar
[1:49:31] after his own name
[1:49:32] and it is called to this day absalom's
[1:49:34] place then said ahaimes
[1:49:36] the son of zadok let me now run
[1:49:39] and bear the king tidings how that the
[1:49:42] lord hath avenged him of his enemies and
[1:49:44] joab said unto him
[1:49:45] thou shalt not bear tidings this day but
[1:49:47] thou shalt bear tidings another day but
[1:49:49] this day
[1:49:49] thou shalt bear no tidings because the
[1:49:51] king's son is dead
[1:49:53] then said joab to kushai go tell the
[1:49:56] king
[1:49:56] what thou has seen and kushai bowed
[1:49:59] himself into joab and ran
[1:50:00] then said a jaime's the son of zedek
[1:50:04] yet again to job by howsoever let me i
[1:50:07] pray thee also run after kushai
[1:50:09] and joab said wherefore will thou run my
[1:50:12] son seeing
[1:50:13] that thou has no tidings ready because
[1:50:16] this
[1:50:16] this this runner this kushai hadn't seen
[1:50:20] the end
[1:50:21] he he only he only heard a shout of
[1:50:24] victory and he gets back to the camp and
[1:50:25] that we won oh we won
[1:50:27] hallelujah can i go tell the king we won
[1:50:30] no because you don't really know the
[1:50:31] details so you've got nothing to say
[1:50:34] all right you're not going to bring the
[1:50:36] king any words of comfort because the
[1:50:38] king is looking for a specific
[1:50:39] piece of information which you don't
[1:50:41] even know anything about
[1:50:42] and so he says but let me run and so and
[1:50:46] so
[1:50:46] by whatsoever he said and and so so he
[1:50:49] says
[1:50:49] what wilt thou run my son verse 22
[1:50:52] seeing thou hast no tidings ready
[1:50:54] verse 23 but whosoever said he let me
[1:50:56] run
[1:50:57] and he said in him run then a jaime's
[1:51:00] ran by the way of the plane and overran
[1:51:02] kushai and david sat between the two
[1:51:04] gates and the watchman went up to the
[1:51:06] roof over the gate into the wall and
[1:51:07] lifted up his eyes and looked and behold
[1:51:09] a man running alone
[1:51:11] and the watchman credence told the king
[1:51:13] and the king said
[1:51:14] if he be alone there is tidings in his
[1:51:16] mouth and he came apace and drew near
[1:51:18] and the watchman saw another man running
[1:51:20] and the watchman called into the porter
[1:51:21] and said
[1:51:22] behold another man running alone and the
[1:51:24] king said he also bringeth tidings
[1:51:27] and the watchman said me thinketh he
[1:51:29] runeth of the foremost
[1:51:31] is like the running of a highmaze the
[1:51:33] son of zedek this is the one who didn't
[1:51:35] have a message
[1:51:36] and he's running without a message he's
[1:51:39] got a part of a message
[1:51:40] now this this very same guy
[1:51:44] had been a messenger for david so he
[1:51:47] knew
[1:51:47] david knew him and he had helped david
[1:51:49] when david was hiding
[1:51:50] see he'd actually snuck out and brought
[1:51:53] secret tidings back and forth to david
[1:51:55] and so so the king said he's a good man
[1:51:58] and cometh with good tidings and a
[1:52:00] jaime's called and said unto the king
[1:52:03] all is well and he fell down to the
[1:52:06] earth upon his face before the king and
[1:52:08] said
[1:52:08] blessed be the lord thy god which hath
[1:52:11] delivered up the man that lifted up
[1:52:13] their hand against my lord the king
[1:52:14] and the king said is the young man
[1:52:17] absalom
[1:52:18] safe and the jaime's answered when joab
[1:52:21] sent the king's servant
[1:52:23] and me thy servant i saw a great tumult
[1:52:25] but i knew not what it was
[1:52:27] and the king said unto him turn aside
[1:52:29] and stand here and he turned aside and
[1:52:31] stood still
[1:52:32] and behold khushai came and kushai said
[1:52:34] tidings my lord the king
[1:52:36] for the lord hath avenged thee this day
[1:52:38] of all them that rose up against thee
[1:52:40] and the king said to kushai is the young
[1:52:43] man absalom
[1:52:44] safe and kush i answered the enemies of
[1:52:47] my lord the king
[1:52:48] and all that rise against thee to do the
[1:52:51] hurt be as that young man
[1:52:52] is and the king was much moved and went
[1:52:55] up to the chamber over the gate and wept
[1:52:57] and as he went thus he said oh my son
[1:53:00] absalom my son my son absalom
[1:53:02] would god i had died for the o absalom
[1:53:05] my son my son
[1:53:08] and so you know
[1:53:12] many many men good men
[1:53:16] i'm not i'm not here to disparage
[1:53:18] anybody that's not
[1:53:19] inside the message of the hour there's
[1:53:21] many good men out there
[1:53:23] and they ran but look at the results
[1:53:26] when they got finished running with
[1:53:28] their message
[1:53:30] they still didn't have the whole message
[1:53:33] they they the the result was you know
[1:53:36] they they wanted to run
[1:53:38] but they're not the ones who got the
[1:53:39] assignment it was like god was saying
[1:53:41] listen i've got a
[1:53:43] one star left in my right hand and i'm
[1:53:46] going to give him the assignment
[1:53:48] and many of them said well let me run
[1:53:50] let me run so he said okay
[1:53:51] run but brother branham says when they
[1:53:53] ran good
[1:53:54] men but they ran without a message and
[1:53:56] what did it produce
[1:53:58] a catastrophe a broken church that
[1:54:02] couldn't go in the rapture
[1:54:04] and you had a bride the result is that
[1:54:06] you arrived with only a
[1:54:08] partial message that couldn't bring
[1:54:10] peace
[1:54:11] nor instruction to the hearers who
[1:54:13] received your message
[1:54:16] i'm here to tell you i want to have
[1:54:18] peace when the message i hear
[1:54:20] i want to have instruction when i get a
[1:54:22] message i don't want a half message i
[1:54:24] don't want to know
[1:54:25] oh he's the son of god i already know
[1:54:26] he's the son of god but what is he today
[1:54:30] what's my direction today in satan's
[1:54:32] eden
[1:54:33] give me the peace for my family this
[1:54:36] world has gone crazy
[1:54:37] and i got to know the whole mystery
[1:54:40] hallelujah and god had one man ordained
[1:54:43] to run that way
[1:54:46] once your revelation was delivered the
[1:54:49] people were still
[1:54:50] missing the most important part of the
[1:54:52] mystery
[1:54:58] you see with calvary in play
[1:55:02] with calvary in play all was still
[1:55:05] lost without that thunder that opened
[1:55:08] the seventh seal
[1:55:11] with calvary in play all was still lost
[1:55:14] unless he took the book
[1:55:16] and loosed the seals yeah i mean here's
[1:55:19] jesus
[1:55:20] loving the rich young ruler it didn't
[1:55:22] save him here's david trying to save the
[1:55:25] life of a man who god had already
[1:55:26] determined to destroy
[1:55:28] and god won't even let him be in the
[1:55:29] battlefield because he had got in the
[1:55:30] way
[1:55:31] you see and so jesus went on
[1:55:34] to die for the sins of the whole world
[1:55:37] but but
[1:55:38] hear me jesus died for the sins of the
[1:55:40] whole world and
[1:55:41] calvary means everything but if you
[1:55:44] refuse the word
[1:55:46] of your day calvary won't save you
[1:55:52] amen i'm here to tell you if you refuse
[1:55:55] the word of your day
[1:55:57] calvary won't save you
[1:56:01] no more today than it would have back
[1:56:03] then if someone would have followed
[1:56:05] jesus
[1:56:05] and stood there and said that's my lord
[1:56:07] he's the son of god and watched him die
[1:56:09] and pledged allegiance and then when the
[1:56:11] holy spirit fell
[1:56:12] and peter started preaching and james
[1:56:14] started preaching and john started
[1:56:16] preaching
[1:56:16] and paul started preaching and you tried
[1:56:18] to say well i don't believe them but i
[1:56:20] love
[1:56:20] jesus i'm here to tell you calvary won't
[1:56:23] save you
[1:56:24] if you refused them
[1:56:28] so we're not bringing something new i
[1:56:31] defy
[1:56:31] anyone to say that i'm bringing another
[1:56:33] gospel i'm only bringing back the
[1:56:35] original
[1:56:36] this is how it's always been
[1:56:41] in the early church every church was a
[1:56:43] message church
[1:56:44] there was no such thing as a church that
[1:56:46] wasn't
[1:56:48] men made other churches man-made
[1:56:50] organization
[1:56:51] created the mess we've got now and it's
[1:56:53] a catastrophe but god sent a master
[1:56:56] builder hallelujah hallelujah and he's
[1:56:59] that holy spirit is among us today to
[1:57:02] lead you
[1:57:02] and i promise you he'll get you home
[1:57:05] he'll get your family home
[1:57:07] he'll get all your loved ones home he's
[1:57:09] worthy of our life
[1:57:12] [Music]
[1:57:14] we had a messenger who knows the whole
[1:57:16] thing
[1:57:17] he knows the mystery the other man's a
[1:57:20] good man
[1:57:21] and i saw something that i don't know
[1:57:22] what it was
[1:57:24] i'm glad we had somebody who who knew
[1:57:27] who went beyond another realm
[1:57:29] and come back and said listen church
[1:57:30] here's what the blueprint says don't get
[1:57:32] it messed up

[1:57:44] the we're in the
[1:57:45] rhythm and the harmony of the composer

[1:58:07] messenger

[1:58:11] for what god did in this day hallelujah
[1:58:16] hallelujah if god sent a rapture message
[1:58:19] and you reject it
