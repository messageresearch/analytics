(Sunday School) A Word Family Pt. 6
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and continuing on speaking about a word family and we're looking at 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 14 I will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully let's pray Heavenly Father we just come before you now and we want to commit this time to you in the name of Jesus Christ and we ask that you'd be with us Lord that you'd take your word and and place it correctly in our hearts Lord as we approach this topic we ask for your anointing and your wisdom for each one of us we ask in Jesus name amen you be seated so we're living I believe in an hour that is so twisted and perverted the minds of people that it's almost difficult to rise above it see above it see through it see through the deception but I believe that's what the preaching of the word is and that's what the Holy Ghost will guide us and lead us into each of us as individuals um if you look at 1 Timothy chapter 5 of course we understand he's speaking about the uh uh the widows and who should be taken in to the number of support for Elisha God bless you he's uh he's our friend from Minnesota he's in the uh uh in the Army in Georgia and I I I hope we'll see him here and there so really good to see you amen um so looking at looking at this he's speaking about who should be taken into the the number of widows who that we support so if if the conditions are met then she should be taken into that but Paul is saying not not the younger women don't just take all the widows in if they have family if the F if the man doesn't support his F his extended family says he's denied the faith and worse than an Infidel that's another part in there then he goes forward and says and about the younger women this is what I want them to do because they're widows their husbands passed away they have every right to remarry says marry bear children and guide the home right and so when we look at this we can understand this isn't actually just a command concerning widows it's not like well the the younger widows should remarry but you know the younger sisters no no don't don't do that do something else so when we can re when we can kind of get that context of that and understand go God's purpose for Womanhood we've spent Five series looking at what Womanhood is the purpose of Womanhood the vision of Womanhood and it's so it's so critical I believe in this hour just to say it direct why is the vision for young ladies to go and get a career I I don't know why that has become a permeating thing I'm not saying that's 100% of people but as as I observe and listen to people talk the first vision is I must find college and a career the heart of motherhood somehow becomes missing in such an hour there should be in a nurt a family should nurture and encourage and put in front of their daughters the glory of motherhood the glory of homemaking the glory of being a wife and a mother and that it isn't something to be ashamed of or oh oh you know uh I have to apologize because I don't have a career I just stayed at home with my children like it's something to be ashamed of the other part is to be the part to be ashamed of is that we're that our culture is producing a bunch of girl bosses that want to work on spreadsheets in some man's office instead of understanding the greatness of the calling that God has placed upon women to keep a home to be mothers to take care of children it is the greatest thing that a woman can do and it is her highest calling now I understand there circumstances and situations and we'll read brother brandham speaks about that but again the circumstances aren't and situations aren't well the American culture demands it our society it's difficult to do it any other way well I mean being a Christian is difficult so should you just become a liberal Christian I'm a liberal Christian cuz it's easier for me to be woke slch Christian at the same time how far should we take this descent into apostasy how about we not take the Descent how how about we stand on God's word and say this is what the word says even if I have to drink as the prophet said lay in the street and drink Branch water and eat soda crackers I will follow God's word regardless of what comes not to look every situation and say that's an exception that's an exception here's an exception here's another exception no we we can't look at it at like that and we can't approach it like that if we're restored back to the original faith I believe this is part of the original faith and I'm going to read some things today the way brother brandham speaks and it's going to offend the modern mindset badly but let it be so let it be so because the reality is the modern mindset doesn't work it's not functional our society is broken and it's literally on the scent on on the direction of total disintegration if you even look at you you say well it doesn't matter that much even uh the birth rates in America are crumbling so much that if the Lord terries and there's a few generation 100 120 years from now there's not going to be and America based upon the the the birth rates here there's not going to be a Europe based upon the birth rates right now so understand that this is very important not just to us as individuals but to societies to the Christian faith as a whole God does not want us with the attitude that children are a burden if we have the mindset children are a burden children are difficult I'd rather have a cat oh I'd rather have a dog and as as the prophet said women are have the nature to mother so they're going to they're probably mother their husband and their cat amen instead of mothering what God has ordained for them to mother and it's it's not it's a shameful thing that our society has come to this place that children are burdened they're difficult and uh I saw I saw a little thing on social media the other day and it said in the past uh people looked at it was I'll have as many children as God will God wills and now it's like well I have cats and dogs that's all I need in the past in the past they would say you know we we look at we look at the world and we don't have enough rain and our crops are suffering let's go sacrifice our children to molok is has things haven't changed amen right at all they say we have global warming let's go abort all the children amen it's the same exact Spirit yes the spirit of molok on the world and upon the nation and it's disgusting amen uh the if you look at the number one issue for women in America if you want to find out why brother brandham said women shouldn't have the vote number one issue for women in America is I want to be able to kill my unborn baby amen that's right amen can you imagine that it is it is the world that we live in it's disgusting it's perverted it's men have refused to be men and women have been refused to be women and even Christian women are scared to boldly Proclaim this is God's purpose and will and function for me and men are scared to step out in faith and say I will provide for my home you're not going to work but but but it's going to be hard okay fine let it be so I'd rather it be hard and do it God's way than it to be easy and do it the world's way questions and answers brother brandham has asked brother brandham are women allowed to work in public affairs when they have a healthy husband and children I'm asking this question for someone else okay this person's hoping that brother brandom will preach on these people that are sitting in in the place place he says well I I I don't know about that I can't say but I just have this feeling let me say this I believe if I was a woman and I know that my husband was healthy and had a good job working I believe it would be a great pleasure to me to stay home take care of my children and make the and take care of my children and raise them up and to love the Lord and if I had any time from Washington things that I was going to do I think I would teach my children how to serve the Lord now if you've got a debt or something you're trying to help your husband pay for or something like you have to do well I think that's fine if you'll try to help him and you live a lady and I I think it's hard no man that's got good understanding wants his wife to get it in a bunch where there's a bunch of vulgar dirty men and things like that but if woman has to get in that I think that she ought her husband ought to know that she's a genuine Christian that can that can be trusted a trustworthy woman but now as to say that she shouldn't work I don't know see there's no scripture to back that up I'm just passing that opinion but I think if a woman wants to work and she wants to now I'm certainly against women working in these offices where all these businessmen they carry on tell them dirty jokes and a nice clean woman sitting there and all these smudy dirty things told around like that I'm against that I think you ought to come out from among such stuff as that but now if a woman can hold herself as a real lady and trying to help her husband do something to meet some clothes for the kids to go to school or pay off a bill or something like that and she wants to work till that's over now this is not the Lord cuz I don't have scripture for this I'm just saying that' be my opinion but otherwise I wouldn't think just CU she wants to work just to run around and have or more money to spend run around and run to barrooms or drink smoke and carry on I don't think she should do it I think she should stay home try to be a lady and take care of her house amen and so again looking at this he's bringing forth the exceptions and when he preaches on this directly in the sermons he'll mention from time to time the exceptions difficulties trials hardships and at the same time we can take that as permission to do whatever we want to do and again we have the perfect will of God and the permissive will of God we've gotten out into our life in a situation it doesn't mean go out and run up a bunch of debt and overspend and say my wife's got to work work forever that's right amen this is like and brother bram's put putting it in the sense of let her do that until right until the thing is taken care of it's not let her do that forever right all right so let's continue to read he says now I'm not much of this modernistic taste of women working when I see these women with these Uniforms on riding around in the city on motorcycles as police it's a disgrace to any City that will let a woman do that see see as many men that's without work it shows the modern thinking of our city it shows the degrading we don't have to have them women out there like that they ain't got no business out there like that when God gave a man a wife he gave him the best thing he could give him outside of salvation but one when one goes to trying to take a man's place then she's about the worst thing that he could get a hold of now that's right amen she's got no place in a defense plant a woman's got place is at home with her children and when she now if her husband's sick she has to work that's different but Woman's Place is at home in the kitchen and when she leaves that she's out of her place exactly right continuing on there's there's quite a number of quotes it'll be a lot of reading so just bear with me when I say this with with respect ladies when a woman gets out of the kitchen she's out of her place that's right that's where she belongs outside of that she has no place and now I'm not hard on them but I just tell what's the truth and what the Bible used to be the man was the head of the house but that was in Bible days he isn't no more he's a puppet or or the babysitter or something and now they want to take care of the dogs practice birth control and pack a little old dog around in their arms all the time so you can run around all night I'm not talking about mother God bless them that's what holds the nation together halfway is a real good sacred God God saved mother that's right but the shame of how degraded that our women is I got a piece out of the paper I cut after this world war number two that said where has the morals of the American women gone that after 6 months overseas four out of five soldiers was divorced from their wives and they had married some other man and couldn't even wait for them to come back from overseas soldiers over there dying on the battlefield that person that does that is not worthy to be called mother that sacred name no it isn't so I've always been called woman hater but I'm not I think a woman is a wonderful thing and a mother especially but they should be their places and not take the place of man and not take the place of God amen amen Titus 2 again this is Paul's instructions to a uh to Titus on setting the church in order setting the families in order and so he comes and says the aged women likewise that they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things so not only your lives but your words should be teachers of good things not teaching the men right that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chased keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed it's amazing to me as we look at this and uh there is a place where the older sisters should be giving the vision of Womanhood to the younger generation amen not just by example but by words and by plotting forth the direction of a young of of the do of their daughters lives showing them teaching them training them how to be a god godly woman am and it it I'll just say it there's no sign of University there's no sign of going after a career the career of Womanhood is being a mother is being a wife is being a homemaker this is the biblical Vision it doesn't matter what culture says and cultures all around the world teach perverted things amen but God's word brings not bondage but real Freedom you know is it the it's come to this place where the modern feministic mindset has said how can you be in bondage to be a homemaker you you you mean to tell me you're going to stay at home and serve your husband and take care of your children and take care of the home I mean look at me I work for a corporate operation I'm climbing the corporate ladder and I'm all alone all by myself and I get to do whatever I want to do it sounds like one person that's saying the other person's in bondage is actually in bondage themselves to a system that's destroying them perverting them and turning them into something that they're not even designed by almighty God to be and that's that's at that's at the core of understanding this this is not A Woman's Place is not a result of the fall and of sin it is a result of God's created order a woman being hurt and abused 100% is a result of the fall and of of sin a woman rebelling against headship is a result of the fall and of sin but a woman being the the nurturing ground the betting grounds of life is not a result of the fall this is God's original design or original creation she's under headship because God created her second secondly after after Adam Adam was created what did Adam do God brought the animals in front of them he named them it shows Authority then he brought then he brought forth from him what the woman her she's named woman why is she named woman cuz she's taken out of man who named her woman her husband it shows Authority not only did he name her then he gave her another name later Hava which means the lifegiver so twice he named his wife for her purpose and for her function woman was not woman was made for the man this is what Paul says this is the clear order of creation he was alone it wasn't good that he was alone and he couldn't multiply himself so God took from Adam's side and made him a helper amen for a woman to enter into that position as a helper as a mother and as as as a homemaker she's actually entering into the position she was created for this was God's original creation God's original purpose and when we can really understand that as the prophet said it wasn't so from the beginning right but it will be at the end because the restoration of the word in the bride it's not enough to just talk about it or say Amen to it at some point we have to come in subjection to it and live it amen Amen brother brandom says put the woman back in the kitchen where she belongs then everything will be all right but you put her out in the public work she's gone and I don't I don't say that the American woman Snicker up their nose and say there's nothing to that and you show me certainly you've got to do it because the Bible predicted you would do it you have to do it and here when it used to be a long time ago in a Methodist Church if a woman cut her hair she was put out of the church certainly they did it yes indeed he Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness Pentecostals all of them used to do it what happened you know why you got some sissies behind the pulpit that's exactly right somebody's afraid their meal ticket afraid you'd excommunicate them run them out of the church they didn't have the very audacity to stand stand on God's word whether it Hur or whether it didn't that's exactly right listen here the man is the ruler don't you think you'll rule the house you're the ruler of the house you're absolutely you're not a slave now but you're a helpmate and Adam the man has ruled over his wife and he's responsible solely for his wife God makes the man answer for his knife for his wife now you read and see if it says that now absolutely the truth and we have such a problem in that's proliferated now in our society that all of the church world has feminized church and church services the the worship is touchy feely feminine appealing worship and the men sitting there going what in the world is this song weird song about Jesus is not my boyfriend he's my Lord and Savior he's my king amen and yes we are the bride to the bridegroom but not everything in the scripture is presented in a feminized way and church isn't to to lean only towards it it certainly meets the needs of sisters right but it also meets the need of men meets the need of their heart the need the the those needs are different the approach is different and God meets need but it isn't a cissified gospel it isn't a feminized gospel it's a it's a manly gospel it's one that produces strength that produces not a jellyfish amen but a solid rock standing there upon the rock of Revelation what business has a woman got being a police policeman wrestling with drunks and things out there that ought to be a man's job if they put some of these women back in the kitchen where they belong men would have more jobs and there there'd be more of them yeah amen amen you see when you look at these things you realize Deuteronomy 225 it speaks about this uh we think it's just merely speaking about garment it says men should not put on the cloak of a woman It also says women should not put on the attire of men when it speaks of the attire of men it's actually speaking about military it's of course it's in general putting on man's clothes in general but very specifically they were not to be in the military and any country that would put the female forward in the military is a perverted country what kind of man what kind of man when an intruder is coming or there's danger says honey go ahead you you deal with it not a good man not a godly man he knows he's the first one to take the hit and he's going to hide his family behind him to defend and protect them not to put the woman out there so putting a woman on the police force putting a woman out in active duty in the military is a total perversion it should never been allowed in a America God said let every word be a lie and his be true my wife wears dress she picks in the garden she has no trouble about it and anyhow a woman ain't got no business with a bunch of men out there hurting up cattle anyhow she be ought to be in the kitchen where she belongs that's right they're just trying to find God's word is woman that's born of the spirit of God will and a man that's born of the spirit of God won't let his wife act like that what did he say she that cuts her hair dishonors her head and her husband is her head she is dishonorable amen when a woman gets from behind the table in the kitchen in the house taking care of her own little Ministry God gave her her babies she's out of the will of God I don't know how that it can be said more plainly than that all right let me see where I'm at I should consider if I should stop at this place I think I can get through this in five minutes brother brandham says the fifth Vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centering mostly around women God showed me that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the vote so I'm just going to say right now repeal the 19th Amendment that's what we ought to do do am things things in our country would change drastically if that Amendment were repealed all right God showed me that women okay I got that then they cut off their hair which signified that they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in most cases more than equal rights she adopted men's clothing and went into a state of undress until the last picture I saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron with this Vision I saw the terrible perversion and moral plight of the whole world and if you remember brother bham also spoke about the fact that this would cause the nation to elect the wrong person and so when when you can really put that together and realize that woman getting the vote it's again it's not a a problem with Holy Ghost filled women the problem is is we understand that in a nation the majority of women aren't going to be holy ghost filled women amen nevertheless nevertheless A Woman's Place is not in politics either either being a politician or voting in politics it's a place for the head of a household yeah and the head of the household should look and he realizes his duty is to protect his wife and his sons and his daughters so when he's voting he takes this all into consideration if he's a if he's a good man he's going to he's going to look at that but what what we have today is when the W woman's vote and if you if you read some of the the literature for those arguing against women's suffrage and I'll do that when I start the next time I just don't have time to do it now is that they realized that what if a woman got the vote it would immediately medely take her out of her position and would insert her into the middle of politics and everything would change she would no longer be in the position that she's supposed to be in the home influencing and raising the children of the family then she would now be subject to every politician coming by and seeking to secure her vote as you see today uh I'm I'm getting into illustrations and into politics you forgive me but I think it's it's applicable to what we're talking about here is even today now you have a Republican party that's moving to the left on abortion and saying oh uh yeah you know early abortion shouldn't be allowed but the rest of it should be allowed and if if even the the the nominee from the party is saying if a abortion ban came to my desk and I was President I would veto that so they why are they doing that it's not because men are asking for that it's not that it's not because they're appealing to the vote of men what are they doing they're appealing to the vote of women because why because every poll tells you that the most important thing for women is to be able to murder their babies as I said before so that is why Republicans are pulling that side but put it repeal the 19th Amendment they're not they're not going to be appealing to Women Voters and trying to say you know you can do do this and you can do that and all these horrible things that are now allowed in our society wearing bikinis uh in public wearing yoga pants in public this all should be illegal and people that do it should be taken to the insane asylum and when you dress in a dress because the world has totally lost its mind to this feminism you you you go out in a dress and dress properly they say look at that uh fanatic and we're looking back at them and look at those insane idiots dressing like they're out of their minds no godly man wants his wife to perade her body out before other men no Godly father wants his daughter to parade her body in front of man it's a total perversion and why do we have this perversion the prophet said it because it started with woman getting the vote it's not a radical thing that brother brandom said we might have thought it was a radical
