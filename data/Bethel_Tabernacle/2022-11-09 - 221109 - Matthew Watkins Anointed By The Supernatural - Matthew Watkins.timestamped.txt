[26:45] Galatians 3 o foolish Galatians who hath

[26:57] evidently set forth crucified among you
[27:00] this only what I learn of you received
[27:04] notice the text here received ye the
[27:07] Spirit by The Works of the law or by the
[27:11] hearing of faith

[27:31] the flesh second Kings chapter 2 quickly
[27:34] and will have you be seated I'm not sure
[27:36] I'll get to this text but I just wanted
[27:38] to make sure we read it so I wouldn't
[27:40] have to cover it once we're going if the
[27:42] Lord decides to lead us this way and it
[27:45] came to pass II kings 2 1 and it came to
[27:47] pass when the Lord would take up Elisha
[27:49] Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that
[27:52] Elijah went with Elisha from gilgall and
[27:55] Elisha said unto Elijah Elijah said unto
[27:57] Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the
[28:00] Lord hath sent me to Bethel and Elisha

[28:32] tonight Lord for every person that's

[28:37] tonight Lord maybe couldn't make it Lord
[28:39] I pray that you would just be close to
[28:41] us right now father Lord is the words
[28:43] that we want to speak tonight Lord we
[28:45] believe are given and the inspiration
[28:48] has been given by you so Lord I pray
[28:51] that you would just come and anoint your
[28:52] word father to the faith to the heart of
[28:55] the believer may they receive it by
[28:56] Supernatural Faith Lord I pray that
[28:59] you'd Grant it tonight in Jesus Christ's
[29:01] name amen you can be seated
[29:04] thank you amen for all the music if you
[29:07] have that my slides you could display
[29:09] that that'd be good anointed by the
[29:11] Supernatural and I I've got quite a few
[29:15] of these uh up here so I want to make
[29:17] sure that we get them make sure we have
[29:18] them up on display for everyone to be
[29:20] able to read them and I'm not going to
[29:22] be able to get to everything the lord
[29:25] has laid upon my heart but I just want
[29:27] to be sensitive to what he wants to
[29:30] speak here tonight
[29:32] brother Brandon says this in the message
[29:34] why Christ speak and this is this the
[29:37] Lord has placed us so strong upon my
[29:39] heart uh you just over the past few days
[29:42] since brother Diggs spoke on Sunday and
[29:44] I've just listened to it several times
[29:46] five or six maybe more times now and I
[29:49] just want to draw something from this
[29:51] man Moses as you hear brother Brandon we
[29:54] only just selected a few quotes but the
[29:57] prophet begins to talk about Moses how
[29:59] that he had received this anointing in
[30:01] his life he had received a commission
[30:03] and and he says here in the message why
[30:06] Christ speak he says may the Holy Spirit
[30:08] teach us today the things that we ought
[30:11] to know and may we then do we have that
[30:14] Brothers make sure the audience is
[30:16] selected I want to make sure we get this
[30:17] on the screen I'm just going to keep
[30:20] reading until they get it here May the
[30:22] Holy Spirit teach us today
[30:25] the things we ought to know may we then
[30:27] in return listen closely to every word
[30:32] and and he says he says uh to weigh it
[30:35] deeply and then may we those who are
[30:37] listening by the way of tape may they
[30:39] listen close and may we be able to catch
[30:42] what the holy spirit is trying to reveal
[30:45] to us so he's since be sensitive here be
[30:49] awake be aware be attentive may we not
[30:53] miss it may we catch what the holy
[30:55] spirit is trying to reveal to us for we
[30:58] realize if he should anoint us then the
[31:01] anointing is not in vain it's for a
[31:04] purpose now I'm preaching to you on
[31:06] anointed by the supernatural so we don't
[31:09] want to use this Pentecostal charismatic
[31:11] I would call it word that's a buzzword
[31:14] in charismatic movements of the
[31:16] anointing and you find almost every
[31:17] title of sermons and spin things that
[31:20] they give is the anointing the anointing
[31:22] the anointing and sometimes people don't
[31:24] even know what that means it's just a
[31:25] fuzzy feeling or something that feels
[31:27] good to say I'm anointed but really
[31:30] there's a there's a there's a biblical
[31:31] meaning and the prophet spoke a lot
[31:34] about what an anointing it what an what
[31:37] anointing means it's not just a fancy
[31:40] word or a funny feeling or a fuzzy
[31:42] feeling that you feel come over your
[31:45] body but in the Bible when a man was
[31:47] anointed it was an oil that God poured
[31:50] over and as the Bible speaks of of of of
[31:54] David when David is Anointed by the
[31:57] prophet Samuel and hell it flowed from
[32:00] David's head and it flowed down his
[32:02] beard and dropped down to his garments
[32:04] all the way down to his feet what he was
[32:07] it was a symbol that God was equipping
[32:10] or God was going to take his purpose and
[32:14] pour it into the life of a man and then
[32:17] that man would come under the anointing
[32:19] of God's purpose and do the job so an
[32:23] anointing was always for a specific
[32:26] purpose it wasn't just given uh to
[32:29] everybody not everybody had the
[32:30] anointing to be king and to
[32:33] uh as David did except David because
[32:36] David had received that anointing not
[32:38] everyone had the anointing that the uh
[32:41] that the Hebrew children had there was
[32:43] an anointing that came upon their life
[32:44] and it was to accomplish a specific
[32:48] purpose
[32:49] so brother Brandon would say May the
[32:51] Holy Spirit teach us may we be sensitive
[32:53] may we listen close
[32:54] may we be able to catch what the holy
[32:58] spirit is trying to reveal to us
[33:01] how good I just uh table searched this
[33:03] today and I thought it was just
[33:05] incredible if you table search the exact
[33:08] phrase don't miss it
[33:10] and you hear how many times brother
[33:13] Branham uh throughout whether it was a
[33:15] sermon or through a prayer line he would
[33:17] make this statement don't miss it
[33:20] make sure you don't miss it and and I
[33:23] was just going through all the way just
[33:25] always usually start from 65 and then
[33:28] move on back to see how many times did
[33:30] brother Brandon say this and it was
[33:32] brother random would have some important
[33:34] something to say or the angel of the
[33:36] Lord in a prayer line and he would say
[33:38] Oh Sister don't miss him oh brother
[33:40] don't miss it don't miss the the spirit
[33:42] of the Lord is trying to speak to you
[33:44] and that's a special thing when God
[33:47] tries to speak it's a special thing when
[33:49] the Lord is trying to give you something
[33:51] or trying to say something to you and I
[33:53] just I felt it so quickened upon my
[33:55] heart when I was there this afternoon in
[33:58] prayer and the Lord just was saying to
[34:00] say to the church here tonight don't
[34:02] miss it all right don't miss what the
[34:04] Lord is trying to do don't miss what God
[34:06] is trying to say to say is the brother
[34:09] random said I could just raise my hand
[34:11] and say Lord let me be attentive let me
[34:14] listen closely let me weigh it deeply
[34:17] Lord what you're trying to speak to me
[34:19] in my life because I believe the Lord is
[34:21] trying to say something this is a time a
[34:24] special time not just any other age not
[34:27] just any other day but there's a special
[34:29] time and a special people who has to
[34:31] receive an anointing and that anointing
[34:34] is something God's given them for a
[34:36] purpose listen to what he says here he
[34:38] says it's for a purpose that it might
[34:40] work to the good he says that might work
[34:43] to the good to the Lord and may our
[34:45] hearts and understanding be open Lord
[34:50] it begins to talk about Moses and he
[34:52] talks about the man Moses and how that
[34:55] God had put so much inside of him listen
[34:57] to what he says in the next slide and he
[34:59] knows how to do these things and how to
[35:01] deal with man he knows what's in man let
[35:06] me say this you may think you know
[35:08] what's inside of you but you really
[35:10] don't only God knows what he's really
[35:12] put inside of it because nothing of who
[35:15] you really are is anything that you've
[35:17] ever accomplished or done in life who
[35:19] you really are is who God said you were
[35:21] before you ever took a first action or a
[35:24] first breath or thought your first
[35:26] thought God knows what he put inside of
[35:28] you
[35:29] and so brother Branham says he knows
[35:31] what's in man he knows he knows him we
[35:34] don't we only know from the intellectual
[35:38] side
[35:40] we only know from the intellectual side
[35:42] whether it's academic or maybe you're
[35:44] just a smart person and you think that
[35:46] your brother Madam says there's a side
[35:48] of that Moses knew who he was by reading
[35:52] the word of God and that's what the
[35:53] prophet says he said he's seen how that
[35:55] God's family would have to sojourn and
[35:58] the land of Egypt for 400 years and
[36:00] brother Brandon says now intellectually
[36:02] he could see that he could see that
[36:04] there would there would that God's
[36:06] people would sojourn for 400 years and
[36:09] then there would come a deliverer and
[36:10] they would be freed
[36:12] yeah and brother Brandon says Moses even
[36:15] recognized this about his own Ministry
[36:17] about himself
[36:18] listen he says here and he says Moses
[36:21] was born in this world and a gifted boy
[36:23] the next slide and he was born to be a
[36:27] prophet a deliverer he was born with the
[36:31] equipment borned in him
[36:34] [Music]
[36:36] I want you to catch that he was born
[36:38] with the equipment born in him it was
[36:43] already there so how was Moses going to
[36:47] perform the miracle that God was
[36:49] requiring he didn't need to look
[36:51] somewhere else he didn't need to look
[36:53] down the road what he needed was already
[36:56] inside of him I hope you catch it
[36:59] tonight stop looking for your answer
[37:01] outside it's laying down inside of the
[37:05] seed God put inside of your life
[37:07] what has to happen is that seed that God
[37:10] has placed the equipment that God has
[37:12] placed inside of you has to be anointed
[37:16] he was born with it as every man comes
[37:19] into this world is born with this
[37:21] equipment next slide Moses born than he
[37:25] was afterwards he was brought the place
[37:26] where he was anointed the next slide to
[37:30] the place where he was anointed so there
[37:33] was a transition something took place in
[37:35] his life there was a time where
[37:37] intellectually he knew it yeah and what
[37:40] did it produce
[37:42] a dead Egyptian
[37:45] right right that's what that's what the
[37:47] Bible says what brother Brown tells us
[37:48] all of his intellectual of his mom and
[37:51] daddy teaching him that's why brother
[37:53] Brandon says to have dramatized it to
[37:55] the kids about joke about and he said I
[37:57] was trying to get them to understand
[37:58] they would sit Moses down every night
[38:00] they would read him the Scrolls they
[38:02] would they would they were doing they
[38:03] were doing their job as parents they
[38:06] were sowing the seed of the word into
[38:07] the little heart of Moses yeah you know
[38:10] what that's what that's what parents
[38:12] that's what we are our job is to do and
[38:14] we can't save them we can't fill them
[38:17] with the Holy Ghost
[38:18] so what do we do throw up our hands no
[38:20] we we sow the seed and we put confidence
[38:23] that if we sow the word in them then it
[38:26] doesn't matter what I am or what mom is
[38:28] or what you do or what what happens in
[38:30] life if you sow the seed all it takes is
[38:33] the light to flash across that seed and
[38:35] it'll come to life
[38:37] so he says they they sow the seed down
[38:40] inside Moses's little heart and he said
[38:42] and he knew it from the time he was born
[38:44] you were a special child Moses you were
[38:47] a proper child what did Brother Brandon
[38:48] mean when he says that he says you were
[38:50] different than all the other little
[38:52] kitties you were different than
[38:53] everybody you you didn't think the same
[38:55] as the rest of the teenagers that you
[38:57] were around you were different Moses
[38:59] you've been in you've been called to it
[39:01] to be a deliverer you were you were
[39:03] called and God said in God brother Adam
[39:04] says and God placed the equipment inside
[39:07] of him when he was born
[39:09] yeah it goes further and says he placed
[39:12] the seed of God inside of Moses
[39:16] so he knew it he was not only equipped
[39:19] with the gift but he was told by his
[39:22] parents he was taught by his church he
[39:24] was taught by the people he was
[39:26] ministered to he was preached to and he
[39:29] intellectually had absorbed all of that
[39:35] yet what did it produce
[39:38] a dead Egyptian
[39:40] he had all of the word all of the
[39:42] ingredients of the word he had all of
[39:44] the teaching good parents good raising
[39:46] told him the truth
[39:49] and he says it was an intellectual
[39:51] exception notice this he says Moses he
[39:53] was born afterwards he was brought to
[39:54] the place where he was anointed and
[39:56] notice the seed laying there with an
[40:00] intellectual conception
[40:04] the seed laid there with an intellectual
[40:08] conception with all the faith that he
[40:12] was born to deliver this people
[40:15] and yet it never come to life
[40:19] until that light from the burning bush
[40:23] flashed across them
[40:26] notice until he seen not something he
[40:30] read about but something he's seen with
[40:33] his eyes something that spoke to him and
[40:36] he spoke back to it
[40:38] oh my brother my sister we ought to say
[40:40] Lord give me an experience where I speak
[40:43] and it speaks back
[40:45] or it's not something I just read about
[40:48] but something I have and experience a
[40:50] living reality
[40:53] that burning bush experience he says oh
[40:55] how that did bring things to life
[40:58] I think any man listen to this next
[41:01] slide I think any man or woman boy or
[41:03] girl I think in an intellectual
[41:05] conception of what they think the word
[41:07] is and so forth never can how I want to
[41:11] just stop here and say this for a minute
[41:12] because we use these terms Paul's that
[41:14] if you could mute that for a second uh
[41:17] you just press the I think it's the beat
[41:18] the button B it'll should mute it
[41:21] um that's that if you can if you can
[41:23] that's good just find a way thank you I
[41:26] don't want people reading ahead of me I
[41:28] got to be careful because we use this
[41:29] word intellectual conception and we're
[41:31] not talking about that's there's there's
[41:33] a context in when that's we're saying
[41:35] that in a negative way but this is not
[41:38] in a negative way it wasn't that his
[41:40] parents had done anything negative
[41:42] by intellectually filling his mind with
[41:45] the word
[41:46] and it's there's nothing wrong listen to
[41:48] me young people here tonight here
[41:50] tonight you're taught the word of God
[41:52] and there's a there's a point in all of
[41:54] our life where we received all of us
[41:56] here today no matter where we are in the
[41:58] family of God if we're born of the Holy
[42:00] Ghost or not whatever stage you're at
[42:02] even if God's done a work in your life
[42:05] and he started to work on your in your
[42:07] life listen an intellectual
[42:09] understanding is all Moses had
[42:12] and it was given to him by his parents
[42:14] notice he says I think any man or woman
[42:16] boy or girl an electoral conception put
[42:18] it back up please and what they think
[42:20] the word is and so forth never can have
[42:24] a full Foundation stand until they have
[42:28] met that light that brings the word to a
[42:32] reality
[42:34] mama can't do that
[42:36] daddy can't do that
[42:38] Pastor can't do that sitting in church
[42:41] can't do that
[42:43] yeah go being around God's family it's
[42:46] wonderful being in the Fellowship of the
[42:48] saints of God it's wonderful
[42:50] but you've got to meet the burning bush
[42:53] for yourself
[42:56] you've got to know that you know that
[42:58] you know that you've you've met the
[43:00] burning bush and the burning bush has
[43:02] spoken to you and you've spoken back
[43:07] and he says he says that brings the word
[43:09] to a reality next slide now hundreds and
[43:12] hundreds of years before notice he says
[43:15] hundreds and hundreds of years before
[43:16] God had said that Israel was sojourn I
[43:19] think I missed a a slide I want to make
[43:22] sure that I have it if I don't that I'm
[43:24] gonna I'm gonna just stop because I felt
[43:27] so LED of the Lord too
[43:29] uh to read this yes it is it's further
[43:31] good thank you Lord now hundreds and
[43:33] hundreds of years let me find my place
[43:35] before God had said that Israel would
[43:38] sojourn and be mistreated in a strange
[43:40] country and would stay there 400 years
[43:42] but God with a mighty hand would bring
[43:44] them out so you see with this Burning
[43:47] Bush just as we know now sorry for the
[43:50] small text
[43:51] as a man asked me a few moments ago
[43:53] about the coming and the Rapture notice
[43:55] where he goes to immediately
[43:58] he's saying Moses had read the word
[44:03] he had he had been told the word
[44:06] and he says brother man and then go
[44:07] straight over and he says just as we
[44:09] know now and now a man asked me a few
[44:12] minutes ago but the coming in the
[44:13] rapture we know we've lived we know
[44:16] intellectually
[44:18] we've lived the time out
[44:21] at the time of the Rapture is at hand
[44:24] and we're looking we're looking
[44:27] we're expecting
[44:29] [Music]
[44:30] we're not just sitting down waiting
[44:33] we're looking we're expecting we're
[44:36] moving towards something we're reaching
[44:38] out
[44:39] and he says we're we're looking for a
[44:42] rapturing faith
[44:44] that can pull the church together and
[44:48] give it some super natural strength
[44:52] that can change these bodies that we
[44:54] live in I'm looking for that
[44:56] when we see a god notice when we see a
[44:59] God that can raise the dead off the
[45:01] floor or out of the yard and bring him
[45:03] back to life again and present it before
[45:05] us when we see a God who could take a
[45:08] cancer that's eat a man to a shadow and
[45:10] raise him up we just witnessed that two
[45:13] thirds two weeks ago a man sat right
[45:15] there where Mason's ate up with cancer
[45:17] dine with cancer and God delivered him
[45:20] of that cancer and he stood before the
[45:22] whole church and testified showing a pet
[45:24] scan full of cancer in a pet scan
[45:26] completely cancer-free
[45:28] when we see a man a God can take a
[45:31] cancer that see the man who shot he
[45:32] raise him up to a strong healthy man
[45:33] that ought to give rapturing faith
[45:38] that ought to give rapturing Faith oh
[45:41] come on friends when are we going to
[45:43] believe it when are we gonna stop saying
[45:45] it but actually accept it
[45:48] that should give Rapture and faith
[45:51] Lord give it to me tonight
[45:57] the body of Christ will be quickly
[45:59] gathered together to change the moment
[46:00] taken in the heavens yes there's got to
[46:02] be something like that happen
[46:07] if I could have just another two hours I
[46:10] would preach and stop right here and
[46:12] just preach a different sermon I have
[46:16] he says there's God to something he says
[46:19] he says there's got to be something this
[46:22] is what the prophet looked for not just
[46:25] in the early stages not just pre-seales
[46:28] but after this it was all the way down
[46:29] to two I can show you just the the
[46:31] communion service leadership brother man
[46:34] I'm saying oh I'm longing to see that
[46:37] Supernatural God come and move amongst
[46:39] his people once again I'm longing to see
[46:42] it brother Brandon says that he says I'm
[46:44] longing to see the real living true God
[46:47] move amongst his family in a
[46:49] supernatural way not an intellectual way
[46:53] not just a preaching sermons
[46:54] intellectual sermons but a burning bush
[46:57] experience where we expect a
[47:00] supernatural God to come and make his
[47:02] word live amen
[47:04] this is what brother Brandon was looking
[47:06] before before he passed away yeah to see
[47:10] that Living God come and make his word
[47:13] live
[47:14] not just take everything that he had
[47:16] preached and just go to seed and
[47:18] everybody Camp down around doctrinal and
[47:20] this difference in teaching this and
[47:22] doctrine of it this wasn't what was on
[47:23] brother Brandon's heart he didn't have a
[47:25] heart to go establish schools of
[47:27] prophets and schools of Theology and
[47:30] camps and said this wasn't on his heart
[47:33] what was on his heart before he left the
[47:35] scene was to see that Living God prove
[47:38] himself alive the same today yesterday
[47:41] and forever sir that was the theme of
[47:44] his ministry until he breathed his last
[47:46] breath
[47:48] say brother brother Matt why is that why
[47:50] is that so stir you up here tonight
[47:52] because there's got to be a transfer of
[47:56] that anointing and there's got to be a
[47:58] transfer of that expectation it wasn't
[48:01] just for a prophet it was so why did God
[48:04] give Hattie ride her voice so that you
[48:06] could have faith to ask for your
[48:09] children why did God give brother
[48:11] Branham why does God give uh give Hattie
[48:14] write her sons so that I could have
[48:16] faith for my family and my children and
[48:18] my lost loved ones there had to be a
[48:21] transfer of that promise
[48:23] to the believer
[48:25] [Music]
[48:28] I can't get sidetracked so let's go
[48:31] they've got to find says they they
[48:33] intellectual are right but you've got
[48:35] noticed this it's got to be something
[48:36] like that happen in our schools of
[48:37] theology can never produce that yet they
[48:40] intellectually are right but you've got
[48:42] to meet that light you've got to find
[48:46] that something
[48:49] in her Moses why Christ speak based in
[48:52] his great call upon the word and it was
[48:54] great until one day he met this light
[48:58] and the Very word itself spoke back to
[49:01] him
[49:04] he wasn't just reading
[49:06] but now what he was reading was now
[49:08] speaking
[49:10] and brother Brandon says then he got his
[49:13] anointing
[49:14] that anointed what he had in him
[49:18] that on the inside
[49:19] the intellects that believed it the
[49:22] faith that was based upon his belief in
[49:25] God that separated him from his mother
[49:27] and now when he strikes in the presence
[49:31] of the light it anointed that that he
[49:35] believed
[49:38] so there's a difference in an
[49:39] intellectual belief in the message of
[49:41] the hour
[49:42] and then when God strikes your heart and
[49:44] you meet the burning bush and it's no
[49:46] longer brother Adam's message it's your
[49:48] message
[49:49] it was no longer what happened there had
[49:51] to be a transfer in Revelations to John
[49:53] which was a type of the Bride it could
[49:56] he couldn't just hear the see the book
[49:58] and and the man the the the the the
[50:00] Bible says that John the angel spoke and
[50:02] said John said give me the little book
[50:05] and the angel said come and take it
[50:09] and eat it
[50:11] what is he saying young people it's got
[50:13] to be more than Mom's message and
[50:15] Daddy's tapes that they play during the
[50:16] day it's got to become your message
[50:19] you've got to go and take the little
[50:21] book
[50:22] and eat it and consume it oh can I get
[50:25] an amen from this church
[50:27] it's got to become ours personally he
[50:30] says Moses knowed this intellectually
[50:32] listen and he says he says Moses knowed
[50:36] this intellectually and the seed that
[50:37] was born in him was laying in his heart
[50:40] and he tried through his intellectual
[50:43] experience with the word to try to bring
[50:45] them out to deliver them because he knew
[50:48] knowed he was born for that purpose he
[50:51] knowed that the time the scriptures all
[50:54] said they had already been there 400
[50:55] years
[50:57] he knew it
[50:59] and actually he knew it
[51:01] brother random says I think no church
[51:04] listen to this
[51:05] I think no church this is profound I
[51:08] could just read this and we could close
[51:11] no matter how intellectual and
[51:14] fundamental it might be that church
[51:17] cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is
[51:21] made known among the people
[51:25] I want a thriving Church
[51:27] and I want to say Lord make that we've
[51:28] already seen it we've already witnessed
[51:30] it he says no church no matter
[51:31] intellectual fundamental until the
[51:33] Supernatural is made known among that
[51:36] people and they see it what does it take
[51:38] it takes an expectation it takes a
[51:41] dedication we preached on it last time
[51:43] it takes a desperation
[51:46] why does God bring trials why does he
[51:48] bring pressure to produce Supernatural
[51:51] desperation and you start asking for
[51:53] things that weren't even in your heart
[51:54] you start longing and thirsting for God
[51:56] when you didn't have a thirst for the
[51:58] Lord you start hungering for his word
[52:00] when it wasn't there and what is what
[52:02] happens God puts you through the law God
[52:04] puts you through the tumbler he puts you
[52:06] in the pressure he puts you in the fiery
[52:08] furnace why because it produces a hunger
[52:11] and a thirst and a desperation
[52:14] not desperation what does it produce a
[52:17] dedication to say Lord I want to see the
[52:19] Living God moving among me moving among
[52:22] my children moving among my family
[52:24] moving among my marriage moving among my
[52:26] church moving in our music moving in our
[52:29] church no in the walls of the whole
[52:31] building of the whole church
[52:33] I've got an expectation I've got a
[52:35] desire Lord I want to be anointed by the
[52:38] supernatural
[52:39] [Applause]
[52:41] he says that church can't Thrive until
[52:42] the Supernatural is made known among the
[52:46] people and they see it something I love
[52:49] this
[52:50] something that they can talk to
[52:54] that will talk back to them
[52:58] I want to see that
[53:00] how many could say that by uplifted hand
[53:03] and say I want a family that thrives I
[53:06] want a home that thrives I want
[53:08] teenagers and children that thrive I
[53:10] want a church that thrives so what am I
[53:12] looking for I'm looking for the
[53:14] manifestation of the supernatural in my
[53:16] home the supernatural in my mind the
[53:19] supernatural at work the supernatural
[53:21] every single day of my life I'm
[53:23] expecting it Lord
[53:26] now notice we can preach the word
[53:29] explain the word but you have to receive
[53:31] the word oh Hallelujah that's what sets
[53:34] it a fire brother when you receive it
[53:37] the revelation
[53:39] something notice
[53:41] slips out of the Unseen World
[53:45] I hope that you don't glaze over this
[53:47] we can preach it we can explain it but
[53:49] you have to receive it that's what sets
[53:51] the fire brother
[53:52] when you receive it the Revelation is
[53:55] something slips out of the Unseen World
[54:00] the under comes rolling down through a
[54:03] mystical Channel somewhere into your
[54:06] soul
[54:07] that's a real New Birth
[54:10] that's not an intellectual dry-eyed
[54:12] confession I've just accepted I just
[54:13] believe it I'm just a I just accept the
[54:15] Creed of the church that's a real Holy
[54:18] Ghost branded experience when something
[54:21] Supernatural slips out brother random
[54:24] says it slips out of the Unseen World
[54:25] and it goes comes rolling down through a
[54:27] mystical Channel somewhere into your
[54:29] soul
[54:31] that says now I see it
[54:36] your eyes brighten your lips that hung
[54:38] down straighten up and smile every
[54:39] muscle in your body seems to rejoice
[54:43] that was testifying to a young person
[54:46] that just the other night and I said you
[54:48] know it's wonderful to see the work it's
[54:50] very simple it's a very simple thing
[54:52] make it so complicated it's very simple
[54:55] you know we you use terms I just want to
[54:58] be closer to the Lord and I got I want
[54:59] more of God in my life I want God in my
[55:01] life listen friends it's very simple
[55:03] there's works of God that God does in
[55:05] people's lives that are apart and
[55:07] they've maybe never been born again of
[55:08] the spirit of God a work of God went
[55:10] into a donkey's mouth and it spoke right
[55:14] that was a work of the Holy Ghost
[55:16] doesn't mean the whole the donkey was
[55:18] born again
[55:19] doesn't mean the donkey has eternal life
[55:21] right
[55:23] what is it it's very simple it's when
[55:26] you know that you know that you know
[55:29] that you have repented of your sins that
[55:32] you have died when you can say it
[55:34] doesn't matter if Mom don't go if Dad
[55:36] don't go though none go with me still
[55:38] I'll follow there's a determination in
[55:40] your heart when you can say I'm going to
[55:42] separate myself from all unbelief I'm
[55:45] going to separate myself from everything
[55:47] that's unlike the Lord everything that's
[55:50] displeasing to him
[55:52] and when you really come with that
[55:53] desperation in your heart and you
[55:55] repented of your sins
[55:57] and you've really repented and forsaken
[55:59] real repentance means you've forsaken
[56:03] everything
[56:07] that's why the Bible says he that's in
[56:09] Christ is a
[56:10] new
[56:12] focus on that word not reformed
[56:16] not remodeled
[56:17] [Music]
[56:18] not remodeled it's new
[56:22] it's not like the remodeling house it's
[56:24] a it's a it's a wrecking ball that comes
[56:27] and bulldozes your entire house
[56:29] starts from the ground and builds you
[56:32] new
[56:33] all things are are passed away behold
[56:37] All Things becometh New
[56:40] when you've really that germ is inside
[56:42] of your life has really been quickened
[56:45] that it doesn't matter there's no
[56:46] compromise it doesn't matter what the
[56:48] world does doesn't matter what friends
[56:49] do
[56:50] it doesn't matter what this brother does
[56:52] and this sister does what family does
[56:55] it comes down to a determination I was
[56:57] testifying that to her last night I said
[57:00] when I was 16 years old the Lord put a
[57:02] desire in my heart I wanted to live for
[57:04] the Lord Jesus I wanted to give my
[57:06] entire life to him so you know what I
[57:08] did I did that yeah
[57:11] and then make it complicated I didn't
[57:14] try to work it up I gave my life to the
[57:17] Lord Jesus and I I gave you my heart
[57:20] I've never asked for it back
[57:23] I've never turned back I've never looked
[57:25] back why there's nothing back there
[57:28] I've separated myself I've burned the
[57:31] bridges behind me
[57:33] you say brother Matt you were better
[57:35] than so I wasn't any better than anybody
[57:37] else around me
[57:38] but what was it it wasn't just an
[57:40] emotional I just want to be close to God
[57:42] I just want to have God in my life it
[57:43] was saying I don't want to be me anymore
[57:45] I want to die out to myself I want to
[57:48] leave me behind I want to be born again
[57:51] by a supernatural birth
[57:55] brother random says your eyes brighten
[57:57] your lips the hung down straighten up
[57:58] and smile every muscle and your body
[58:00] seems to Rejoice Angelic notice this
[58:02] here next slide here he says now he says
[58:04] Angelic beans make sure I didn't miss
[58:07] that good Angelic beings associate
[58:10] together
[58:12] oh I hope you get that that just dropped
[58:14] right down free look
[58:16] if you've got the holy spirit in you
[58:18] then you're a candidate for association
[58:22] with the Unseen World
[58:25] and the supernatural
[58:28] did you hear me France
[58:30] when the Holy Spirit comes into you it
[58:32] opens an entire Dimension that you never
[58:34] had access to before and it's not just a
[58:37] dimension of devils and demons and
[58:39] depression and anxiety now there's a
[58:41] doorway open to joy and peace and love
[58:45] and harmony and health and sin and
[58:48] satisfaction a dimension of angelic
[58:51] beings to come and anoint your life
[58:54] do you realize that that Angels come to
[58:57] and send you an anointing we're going to
[59:00] read here in a minute
[59:01] Angels come as ministering spirits to
[59:04] you
[59:06] amen no wonder people can't believe in
[59:08] those things they've never come in
[59:10] contact
[59:11] they've got nothing in here to believe
[59:13] with but when the Holy Spirit comes into
[59:16] the heart quickly he becomes then a
[59:21] two-fold being one of the earth to die
[59:24] and one of Heaven to live amen and his
[59:28] body in his body in your body brother
[59:30] man when you receive the Holy Ghost you
[59:31] were just you were just free of all sin
[59:33] no temptation no that's when the battle
[59:35] really began
[59:37] because I'm a twofold being now and he
[59:40] says his body is still subject to death
[59:42] but in his soul he's passed from Death
[59:45] unto life and his body he has his
[59:48] Earthly contact with his five senses in
[59:51] his Spirit he has a covenant he says and
[59:53] he has a contact with God through the
[59:55] Holy Ghost and the angels of God visits
[59:59] them
[1:00:01] speaks with them
[1:00:03] yeah
[1:00:04] and their Messengers sent from God to
[1:00:07] reveal and to bring messages from God to
[1:00:11] the individual
[1:00:13] oh I say let angels and cap about me
[1:00:16] let Angels let an Angelic hosts around
[1:00:19] me let them minister to me I'm tired of
[1:00:22] the Demons I'm tired of the troubles I'm
[1:00:24] tired of the depression I want to open
[1:00:26] myself up I want to close those channels
[1:00:28] how many can say that and I'm going to
[1:00:30] open up a supernatural expectation to
[1:00:33] say Lord I believe I can be anointed
[1:00:36] even if I don't feel like it here
[1:00:37] tonight I might have came here to this
[1:00:39] church feeling dry as I could ever be
[1:00:41] but I'm going to say Lord I believe I
[1:00:43] can be influenced by angels that can
[1:00:46] minister to me
[1:00:48] could anoint my faith notice he says
[1:00:51] then what have we got to be worried
[1:00:53] about Jesus is here
[1:00:55] his spirit is here
[1:00:58] what happened just now
[1:01:00] brother Brandon message Faith 1956. what
[1:01:04] happened
[1:01:05] just now I went into another world
[1:01:09] it's an Unseen World we become so
[1:01:12] conscious of looking at one another like
[1:01:14] this
[1:01:15] but there's an Unseen World
[1:01:18] it's greater than anything you can see
[1:01:23] and here's Christ
[1:01:25] in this world in this building
[1:01:29] here our evil spirits and War
[1:01:34] you might not have recognized that or
[1:01:36] realized that before stop reading the
[1:01:38] head listen you come to church you come
[1:01:40] to a Battleground
[1:01:43] ever do you know that every time you
[1:01:44] open your mouth and say my father
[1:01:46] whatever you say and address the Lord
[1:01:48] you open a dynamic Supernatural
[1:01:50] Dimension into another world
[1:01:53] when you open your mouth and you begin
[1:01:55] to pray that's what spiritual warfare is
[1:01:58] that's why Paul says we don't wrestle
[1:02:00] with flesh and blood against Prince or
[1:02:01] principalities but spiritual wickedness
[1:02:04] in high places therefore put only a
[1:02:06] whole armor of God
[1:02:08] what is it it's a supernatural War
[1:02:10] brother random says in this building
[1:02:12] right now notice and just in the
[1:02:14] previous quote he says what happened
[1:02:15] just now I stepped into another place I
[1:02:18] stepped out I moved into another
[1:02:20] dimension I left this place my body was
[1:02:22] still here but I moved into another
[1:02:24] dimension in this world in this building
[1:02:26] here are evil spirits and War
[1:02:29] and Christians anointed
[1:02:32] and the angels of God encamped about
[1:02:35] them trying to energize them with
[1:02:40] [Music]
[1:02:41] do you know that when you go out into
[1:02:42] the world there's not anything trying to
[1:02:44] energize us trying to de-energize you
[1:02:47] and you've got whether you can see it or
[1:02:49] not in an unknown unseen Dimension
[1:02:51] you've got every kind of stress and
[1:02:53] worry and trouble and Satan will
[1:02:55] bombards you with it whether it's
[1:02:57] sickness in the body or the Mind what's
[1:02:59] he trying to do he's trying to take a
[1:03:01] Christian and sap them of their energy
[1:03:03] he's trying to de-energize you that's
[1:03:06] why in the during the day you should be
[1:03:08] playing the tape of a prophet of the
[1:03:10] Prophet you should be playing a tape of
[1:03:12] brother Brandon why it's going to
[1:03:13] energize your faith you should be
[1:03:15] opening up the Bible and saying Lord I'm
[1:03:17] speaking speak back to me
[1:03:20] what's it doing it's energizing your
[1:03:22] faith
[1:03:26] and so is God here and the
[1:03:31] right here in this building tonight is
[1:03:35] angels and War but then there's God
[1:03:39] there's demons and War and spiritual
[1:03:41] wickedness and on this side over here if
[1:03:44] you would receive it there's the Lord
[1:03:46] Jesus himself
[1:03:47] and angels that are trying to energize
[1:03:50] your faith
[1:03:52] oh we ought to be an expectation for
[1:03:54] that we ought to be an expectation what
[1:03:57] does the song leader doing when he's up
[1:03:58] here seeing he's not just performing we
[1:03:59] don't have her performance these
[1:04:01] musicians aren't performing they do
[1:04:03] something mechanically and naturally but
[1:04:05] what are they trying to do they're
[1:04:06] trying to create an atmosphere so that
[1:04:10] heaven can just be open just for a
[1:04:12] moment so the joy can flood through the
[1:04:14] building so the peace can come into your
[1:04:17] life so that answers could come to your
[1:04:19] questions so that strength can come to
[1:04:22] your weaknesses
[1:04:24] amen and he says so is God so is angels
[1:04:28] and someday it'll be just as much
[1:04:31] reality as television or anything else
[1:04:34] because the spirit will bring us into
[1:04:36] that Immortal Life
[1:04:39] praise God then we'll understand
[1:04:44] someday
[1:04:45] that spirit of God that you're feeding
[1:04:47] right now
[1:04:49] someday I'll bring you into that
[1:04:51] Immortal Life
[1:04:52] you don't understand that right now you
[1:04:55] just get a glimpse of it and pieces of
[1:04:57] it and you have a connection to it
[1:04:59] but one day brother Bynum says the
[1:05:02] spirit will bring us in there fully into
[1:05:04] Immortal Life
[1:05:06] then we'll understand
[1:05:09] then we'll understand
[1:05:11] brother Adam says this he says Moses had
[1:05:13] to have his faith
[1:05:16] anointed I just forgive me this while I
[1:05:18] determine where what direction we're
[1:05:20] going to go with this here tonight
[1:05:23] notice what brother Branham says in the
[1:05:24] countdown we've read this last time now
[1:05:26] the horse and buggy days was who that
[1:05:28] was the end of the Lutheran age see
[1:05:29] horse and buggy they believed in
[1:05:30] justification God bringing the church
[1:05:32] from romanism Catholicism he brought it
[1:05:34] into his first Supernatural achievement
[1:05:36] that the just shall live by faith that
[1:05:39] was the horse and buggy days
[1:05:40] as they come from the horse and buggy
[1:05:42] days that ended now the next achievement
[1:05:45] man how did the way of transportation
[1:05:46] was the automobile you notice the
[1:05:48] automobile increases all the time in its
[1:05:50] power the end of the Wesley age brought
[1:05:52] in by spiritual achievement
[1:05:54] sanctification which means the church
[1:05:56] raised that's an important word she's
[1:05:59] moved up from a Justified state to a
[1:06:02] Sanctified State now we noticed again
[1:06:04] Along Came the methodists with
[1:06:06] sanctification there's many of those
[1:06:07] methodists was actually sanctified
[1:06:11] there's a lot of them that claim to know
[1:06:13] nothing about it
[1:06:15] listen friends just because you're part
[1:06:17] of something doesn't mean you partake of
[1:06:19] something right
[1:06:21] hello
[1:06:23] those methodists were there and
[1:06:24] sanctification just because they were
[1:06:26] all under his message doesn't mean they
[1:06:28] were all Sanctified you can be part of a
[1:06:31] movement and part of a Revival and part
[1:06:34] of an energy and part of a power and
[1:06:37] never partake of it yourself
[1:06:40] remember how we heard brother John Andy
[1:06:42] speaking about that at Youth Camp Billy
[1:06:43] Paul and his life had seen the angel
[1:06:45] even seen the angel of the Lord been
[1:06:46] there in the prayer lines and yet was so
[1:06:48] close yet so far
[1:06:51] amen some of those methodists he says
[1:06:54] but some of them I love this Methodist
[1:06:56] Church the Methodist Church taught
[1:06:57] sanctification they said they got down
[1:07:00] and cried and got back up glory to God
[1:07:01] I'm Sanctified they went right on living
[1:07:03] like they always did but some of those
[1:07:05] men and women was actually sanctified
[1:07:09] from the things of the world and lived a
[1:07:12] consecrated set-aside life
[1:07:17] some of them didn't miss it
[1:07:20] brother man says don't miss it
[1:07:23] that was the automobiles which took in
[1:07:25] more horsepower automobile the old T
[1:07:26] model was probably 15 or 20 horsepower
[1:07:28] she had 15 20 horses bottled up in a
[1:07:30] little engine like that sanctification
[1:07:32] when science achieved something by the
[1:07:34] natural God is achieving something by
[1:07:35] the spiritual see something's going on
[1:07:37] all the time then after the Sanctified
[1:07:40] notice what brother random says just the
[1:07:42] same as Henry Ford
[1:07:43] and them done with the transportation of
[1:07:45] the old Model T Ford up the side of the
[1:07:48] horse he moved on and above the horse
[1:07:50] State Wesley moved on and above the
[1:07:52] Lutheran day then Along come Pentecost
[1:07:54] next slide and as science of the world
[1:07:56] was able to achieve an automobile motor
[1:07:58] the Wright brothers that created or made
[1:08:01] manufactured rather the airplane the
[1:08:04] Flying Machine was far above the car on
[1:08:06] the Earth because he took to the air
[1:08:11] now the Wright brothers through their
[1:08:13] achievement was able to take science and
[1:08:14] pattern something here on Earth to show
[1:08:15] that there was a great spiritual thing
[1:08:18] fixing to happen
[1:08:21] remember we preached on this every
[1:08:22] achievement of man is only a foreshadow
[1:08:25] of what God's doing what he's doing in
[1:08:27] the natural man God's doing in the
[1:08:28] Supernatural
[1:08:30] and he says he's moving on up he's
[1:08:31] moving on up and he says he says it
[1:08:34] showed some great spiritual something
[1:08:36] fixing to happen and when the Wright
[1:08:37] brothers was able notice this wasn't
[1:08:40] these men they whether they realized it
[1:08:42] or not it was an anointing an intellect
[1:08:45] that God put upon the minds of men
[1:08:47] because he was needing to do something
[1:08:50] in the church
[1:08:52] because he was needing to do something
[1:08:55] to his family
[1:08:57] so what does he do he allows just like
[1:09:00] there's always been a way of a a Canaan
[1:09:03] enable a true and a false and brother
[1:09:05] random says they've always sought
[1:09:07] achievement Cane's seed has always built
[1:09:09] cities uh where where where great uh you
[1:09:12] know Builders of cities brother Brandon
[1:09:13] says what was it they were always moving
[1:09:15] towards education always moving towards
[1:09:18] science but the further you go towards
[1:09:20] education and science the further you
[1:09:23] get away from God
[1:09:25] hello that's what brother Brandon said
[1:09:28] and he says notice here they were they
[1:09:30] they were achieving something in the
[1:09:32] natural
[1:09:33] but for those that didn't miss it God
[1:09:36] was doing something in the Supernatural
[1:09:39] when the Wright brothers went to achieve
[1:09:40] that get a man's feet off the ground
[1:09:42] Pinnacles fell and took to the air
[1:09:46] with a spiritual gift with the baptism
[1:09:49] of the Holy Ghost he took to the air oh
[1:09:53] Hallelujah got his feet off the ground
[1:09:56] he could swim around got up in the air
[1:09:59] how far he was above the horse and buggy
[1:10:02] how far he was above the automobile he
[1:10:07] was up in the air
[1:10:11] President says what did it represent
[1:10:13] it's no longer intellect no longer
[1:10:15] theology no longer Martin Luther John
[1:10:17] Wesley was no longer a man anointing but
[1:10:20] God was trying to get his church that he
[1:10:22] had restored to come off of the Earthly
[1:10:24] and come up into the heavenly
[1:10:27] and brother random says notice this he
[1:10:29] was up in the air he was knocking and
[1:10:30] puffing and banging but he was flying
[1:10:34] what man achieves on Earth for they're
[1:10:36] made of things which do not appear God
[1:10:38] was able to achieve Something by A
[1:10:39] Spirit-filled people who were sitting
[1:10:42] there with their arms crossed and looked
[1:10:44] like bumps on a pickle
[1:10:47] let's read it again God was able to see
[1:10:49] something about spiritual people who
[1:10:50] were sitting there didn't really care
[1:10:52] just another Wednesday night just
[1:10:53] another service
[1:10:55] brother random said You know here we are
[1:10:57] 2022. what's going to happen next no it
[1:11:00] was people who were hungering and
[1:11:03] thirsty
[1:11:04] and those that would stay with the word
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:10] amen if Wesley hadn't stepped out of the
[1:11:12] word and got a bad name behind him it's
[1:11:14] Carter crazy man and everything he would
[1:11:15] have never been able to achieve but
[1:11:16] Wesley was one of God's Great scientists
[1:11:18] Luther is one of God's Great scientists
[1:11:19] they didn't care what the church said
[1:11:20] what the organization said Luther didn't
[1:11:21] care what the Catholic said he believed
[1:11:22] the just shall live by faith Hallelujah
[1:11:24] I love this and he took the Kim of God's
[1:11:26] chemicals of the word and put it
[1:11:28] together and the church moved by faith
[1:11:31] Wesley put it together by the blood and
[1:11:33] proved it by the blood and the church
[1:11:34] got Sanctified the Pentecostals believed
[1:11:37] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost at
[1:11:38] the promise next slide he says that the
[1:11:41] promise is to you and your children and
[1:11:43] them that's far off and they put the
[1:11:45] chemicals together out of the word and
[1:11:48] they moved into the air
[1:11:52] they weren't Earthbound anymore
[1:11:55] everything looked different
[1:11:58] the same Earth that they had lived in
[1:12:00] the same word the same Bible that they
[1:12:02] had read
[1:12:04] now they got a different view of the
[1:12:06] world
[1:12:07] you ever got up in an airplane
[1:12:08] everything looks so different you say
[1:12:10] man I didn't even know that about
[1:12:11] Savannah you know about Charleston never
[1:12:13] even knew when I was flying landing on
[1:12:15] the airport I was actually near the
[1:12:16] Tallmadge Bridge could have hit it at
[1:12:17] any time didn't know I was only like
[1:12:19] three months maybe two miles as the crow
[1:12:21] flies
[1:12:22] but now you get up there
[1:12:25] and it's like oh man everything looks so
[1:12:27] different you see when God brings you
[1:12:30] higher and he gives you a revelation you
[1:12:32] come up higher all of your old previous
[1:12:34] thoughts and previous ideas and
[1:12:37] misconception is what you thought about
[1:12:39] God and what you thought about his word
[1:12:40] you have a whole new view
[1:12:44] [Music]
[1:12:45] that's why when you talk to someone
[1:12:47] who's never been up in the air in a
[1:12:49] plane and you try to tell them and
[1:12:50] describe them your but your view from
[1:12:52] the sky they just go ah
[1:12:55] yeah I don't know about that
[1:12:57] but once you've been up there and once
[1:13:00] you've experienced it
[1:13:01] and once you've tasted of it and once
[1:13:04] you've moved up in the air and you're no
[1:13:06] longer Earthbound brother Brandon says
[1:13:08] oh he says the Pentecostals believe the
[1:13:10] baptism the promises to you and your
[1:13:11] children they put the chemicals they
[1:13:13] moved out Hallelujah they moved out
[1:13:15] because they were able to accomplish
[1:13:16] stuff
[1:13:18] did you notice one of those scientific
[1:13:20] achievement accompanied the other one
[1:13:22] complimented the other one I know we
[1:13:24] read this last time but I just want to
[1:13:26] cover it the automobile was a higher
[1:13:28] form of transportation than the horse
[1:13:30] and the airplane was a higher form of
[1:13:31] charge facing the automobile but they
[1:13:33] accompanied one another you didn't do
[1:13:35] away with one just because we received
[1:13:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:13:39] mean you don't have to be justified and
[1:13:41] sanctified
[1:13:43] and set aside for service right then
[1:13:46] when you receive the Holy Ghost you're
[1:13:48] not set aside you're put into service
[1:13:51] what about the Holy Ghost he says notice
[1:13:53] the automobile was higher they accompany
[1:13:54] one another horsepower if that's
[1:13:56] horsepower what about God power
[1:13:59] what about the Holy Ghost in power
[1:14:01] he says what was it no to skip on down
[1:14:04] to the Bold part they were spiritual
[1:14:06] scientists
[1:14:07] they seen the thing they believed it man
[1:14:09] did it by education the Natural Science
[1:14:11] the spiritual science has done it by
[1:14:13] Revelation one by education the other by
[1:14:16] Revelation oh if we can just open up
[1:14:18] there's all kinds of material laying
[1:14:20] right there
[1:14:21] but now notice this
[1:14:24] next but now
[1:14:27] something else
[1:14:29] has
[1:14:31] happened amen
[1:14:34] amen we got an astronaut now
[1:14:36] John Glenn our first astronaut found out
[1:14:38] so far above the airplane airplane can
[1:14:40] go you know you've had that view of the
[1:14:42] airplane
[1:14:43] but when you get that astronaut view man
[1:14:46] it changes again
[1:14:50] and it's similar to what you had when
[1:14:53] you were in the airplane
[1:14:54] but in some ways it's all together
[1:14:56] different
[1:14:58] you look at everything different the
[1:15:01] Bible becomes a brand new book
[1:15:06] and he says it's a greater power I love
[1:15:07] this that presses him so much higher
[1:15:10] than an airplane even is it that's right
[1:15:12] he's been able to do that all right now
[1:15:14] we gotta and I've got an astronaut a
[1:15:17] natural age notice you couldn't see it
[1:15:20] with your natural eyes next slide and
[1:15:22] the Bold you couldn't see it with your
[1:15:24] natural eyes
[1:15:25] and it can go whether there's any
[1:15:27] pressure there or not he can just go on
[1:15:28] out there because it's in a pressurized
[1:15:30] tank he could go out there and sell
[1:15:32] around and see the worlds around an
[1:15:34] astronaut oh my what an age that is
[1:15:36] coming yes sir go beyond any natural
[1:15:38] things at all and sweet Plum out into
[1:15:40] Yonder what does it represent a
[1:15:42] spiritual age a spiritual time where
[1:15:44] God's going to have spiritual astronauts
[1:15:47] amen they're here right now
[1:15:52] the Eagles are there that could go
[1:15:54] beyond any other birds sell above
[1:15:55] everything spiritual astronauts that can
[1:15:57] take the word of God and prove that he's
[1:15:58] the same yesterday today and forever a
[1:16:02] spiritual ass
[1:16:04] Glory that makes me feel good living in
[1:16:06] this age what a wonderful thing a
[1:16:07] spiritual astronaut notice and vote he
[1:16:11] says you become an astronaut that can go
[1:16:13] so far next slide it's beyond
[1:16:16] denominational thinking
[1:16:19] it's beyond
[1:16:21] anything else
[1:16:23] it's beyond the things of the church
[1:16:26] out yonder with God and him alone you
[1:16:31] stay
[1:16:32] astronauts yeah it's different than
[1:16:35] everything else
[1:16:37] it's different listen to me friends the
[1:16:40] message that came that we received was
[1:16:42] different
[1:16:43] than everything else previous and prior
[1:16:47] this was what was it as a fulfillment I
[1:16:51] don't have time nearly to cover we're
[1:16:53] just closing here but I just want to
[1:16:54] come to one more point
[1:16:56] this was a fulfillment of of a Biblical
[1:16:59] Prophecy of the coming of the Lord do
[1:17:03] you realize that
[1:17:05] you say brother Matt was it the coming
[1:17:06] was it there's still a physical Corporal
[1:17:09] coming of course we believe that
[1:17:11] but the stage of the the Rapture is in
[1:17:14] three phases three stages
[1:17:17] so the astronauts that would be launched
[1:17:19] the people that would be launched out of
[1:17:21] the airplane
[1:17:22] and go and sell Beyond this the
[1:17:25] atmosphere to the stratosphere beyond
[1:17:27] the Milky Way what was it it was a super
[1:17:30] natural power it was a supernatural
[1:17:35] message it was not an intellectual
[1:17:38] message it wasn't even an educated
[1:17:40] message message it wasn't a scientific
[1:17:43] message that might have been all right
[1:17:44] for another age and another anointing
[1:17:47] when those men were under that man age
[1:17:49] I'm sure they were a college educated
[1:17:51] educated refined eloquent polished
[1:17:55] men
[1:17:57] but this anointing wasn't going to be
[1:17:59] about polished and educated and
[1:18:01] sophisticated and scientific
[1:18:04] do you realize that God that's why God
[1:18:07] sent it to a Kentucky hillbilly who
[1:18:09] didn't have us about a seventh grade
[1:18:11] education because why God was not going
[1:18:14] to do it among the masses he wasn't
[1:18:16] going to do it it was going to be
[1:18:18] something altogether different it was
[1:18:20] going to come to the illiterate it was
[1:18:22] going to come to the simple it was going
[1:18:24] to come to the humble
[1:18:26] [Applause]
[1:18:27] thank God that was what it was
[1:18:28] representative that's why brother
[1:18:30] Brandon was so he wasn't just so that we
[1:18:31] canoe and all and so what a humble man
[1:18:33] what a man it was wonderful man of God
[1:18:35] was wonderful it was the reason he was
[1:18:37] poor came from a poor family there was a
[1:18:40] reason he was uneducated
[1:18:44] it was going to be a super when the
[1:18:46] spirit of God poured out upon a group
[1:18:48] and uh in the book of Acts it didn't
[1:18:51] come to the theologians it didn't come
[1:18:53] to the educated it came to simple people
[1:18:58] common people
[1:19:00] it came to illiterate people people that
[1:19:03] didn't understand brother man is there
[1:19:04] anything wrong with being smart no
[1:19:05] there's not anything wrong with it
[1:19:06] nothing whatsoever I'm talking about
[1:19:09] what the word of God did spiritually
[1:19:10] listen friends it wasn't the book of
[1:19:13] Acts was not filled with intellectual
[1:19:15] sophisticated people
[1:19:18] what was it it wasn't going to be
[1:19:19] anything natural
[1:19:22] it was going to be super yeah
[1:19:25] and the educated mind can't understand
[1:19:27] can't believe the supernatural
[1:19:30] but the simple
[1:19:32] and the simple-minded
[1:19:34] even the uneducated and unilliterate you
[1:19:37] read about the Revival that came to the
[1:19:40] Azusa Street Pentecost read about the
[1:19:43] men that were that this was a real move
[1:19:45] of God the pouring out of the spirit it
[1:19:48] didn't come to find Refined it wasn't
[1:19:50] Azusa Street Church was not a refined
[1:19:53] church with a massive steeple a brick
[1:19:55] building with white uh you know shutters
[1:19:58] and beautiful and educated and people
[1:20:01] wearing suits and driving fancy cars
[1:20:03] that's not where God poured out a spirit
[1:20:06] it was on a dingy little dark place
[1:20:09] where there was illiterate people it was
[1:20:11] on it was on a place that everybody
[1:20:13] looked at in the town and thought Oh
[1:20:14] what is that that little hole in the
[1:20:16] wall church that little nothing that
[1:20:18] little what is that little weirdo Church
[1:20:19] on Mossy Oaks Road little something
[1:20:21] that's listen it wasn't about the big
[1:20:23] Steeples and the big churches and the
[1:20:26] big intellect and the big fancy
[1:20:27] scientific things it was going to be a
[1:20:30] supernatural people a supernatural word
[1:20:33] where a simple people could believe it
[1:20:36] and have Supernatural faith
[1:20:38] [Applause]
[1:20:40] it was to the humble
[1:20:42] [Applause]
[1:20:44] those men were in Azusa Street weren't
[1:20:46] even educated
[1:20:50] so you know what it does
[1:20:52] and you take educated men
[1:20:55] and they want some of that
[1:20:57] and they start getting brother Brandon
[1:20:58] talks about this in the deceived Church
[1:21:00] by the world
[1:21:01] and he's noticed I'm just going to read
[1:21:02] it here Lord you told me to I'm going to
[1:21:06] notice what notice what brother Brandon
[1:21:08] says here
[1:21:09] just give me just one minute to find to
[1:21:11] find it here
[1:21:13] brother random says notice here
[1:21:21] and he says and I may not I may read a
[1:21:24] few more than I than I than I need to
[1:21:25] but that's all right this is the second
[1:21:27] Sue he says but notice
[1:21:29] uh I just won't let them just forgive me
[1:21:31] just for one moment let me make sure
[1:21:34] yes and he says here he says notice this
[1:21:37] white horse rider now just background in
[1:21:39] a little bit in this seal notice the
[1:21:40] white horse rider remember he wasn't
[1:21:42] Christ that's what brother Brandon had
[1:21:44] previously thought
[1:21:45] right wasn't Christ he says when he went
[1:21:47] out he serves in three stages notice the
[1:21:50] devil as I proved to you the other night
[1:21:52] is in a trinity just like God but it's
[1:21:55] the same devil all the time in three
[1:21:57] stages notice his stages in the first
[1:22:01] stage he comes in the Holy Ghost fell
[1:22:04] and people had everything in common
[1:22:09] that's what the Bible the book of Acts
[1:22:10] says hello Bible readers
[1:22:14] and they had all things in common
[1:22:16] there were no big eyes there were no
[1:22:18] little use the brother Brandon talks
[1:22:21] about oh brother Jones sister Jones no
[1:22:23] there was none of that
[1:22:24] everybody had all things in common
[1:22:27] socialism really
[1:22:30] everybody just gave gave up they gave of
[1:22:33] their own gave it their own uh uh uh
[1:22:36] increase gave to the church the spirit
[1:22:38] of God notices fell upon them and the
[1:22:40] apostles I love this I wish I had it
[1:22:42] here for you to read and he says in the
[1:22:44] spirit of God fell among them and the
[1:22:45] apostles went from house to house
[1:22:47] breaking bread with people
[1:22:49] and there was great science notice he
[1:22:51] doesn't say they went to house to house
[1:22:53] pulling out the Greek and the and the
[1:22:55] and the books of Theology and notice
[1:22:57] over here in the school notice he went
[1:22:59] to them breaking bread to people
[1:23:03] what was it about it was about
[1:23:05] supernatural a supernatural expectation
[1:23:09] a supernatural work
[1:23:11] he says he went and broke bread and
[1:23:14] there was a great signs and wonders and
[1:23:16] the first thing you know Satan began to
[1:23:18] cause a murmur to come up Ah that's his
[1:23:19] first stage
[1:23:21] the first stage in the falling of a way
[1:23:23] of the original message started with
[1:23:25] complaining
[1:23:28] and if that isn't exactly what started
[1:23:30] the fall in a way in our message
[1:23:32] and we really got to dress like that now
[1:23:34] we really got we really got to look like
[1:23:36] that we really got to listen to that
[1:23:38] kind of preaching we really got to teach
[1:23:40] that to our children I mean I was fine
[1:23:41] when my children were two and three and
[1:23:42] four but now brother Matt you know
[1:23:44] they're teenager I really got to force
[1:23:45] those kind of I gotta I gotta live like
[1:23:47] that I mean really what did it start
[1:23:48] with
[1:23:50] remember brother Brandon said it was
[1:23:51] came to those who stayed with the word
[1:23:56] and he says notice this here and he says
[1:23:59] he says it started with murmur then
[1:24:01] after a while these slaves and the poor
[1:24:04] of the land what received the Holy Ghost
[1:24:06] they went out into different places
[1:24:08] testifying poor people people that were
[1:24:11] slaves they testified to their masters
[1:24:14] and after a while they're beginning to
[1:24:16] become all kinds of army captains and
[1:24:18] different things and celebrity begin to
[1:24:20] see the gallantry and the Miracles and
[1:24:23] the signs that these men had done so
[1:24:25] they accepted Christianity don't let me
[1:24:28] lose you please
[1:24:29] and he says notice the work of God went
[1:24:31] out then all the dignity seated they
[1:24:33] went back and told their slave masters
[1:24:35] and I said let me hear about this oh
[1:24:36] it's Miracles Supernatural
[1:24:39] so they received it we accepted
[1:24:41] Christianity
[1:24:42] when he embraced Christianity notice
[1:24:45] this he says here well then you see when
[1:24:48] he embraced embraced Christianity and go
[1:24:51] down there to a place where they're
[1:24:53] meeting and a little old dark dingy Hall
[1:24:57] and clapped their hands and shout and
[1:25:00] speak in tongues and getting messages
[1:25:02] why he could never take that to his
[1:25:05] competitor notice immediately
[1:25:06] intellectually
[1:25:08] I see the miracle I see the fire I see
[1:25:10] the signs and wonders I see the power of
[1:25:12] God
[1:25:13] but when he go down there to that little
[1:25:15] dingy dark place where they're clapping
[1:25:17] and and Shout people shouting and
[1:25:19] speaking in tongues
[1:25:21] and he says notice he'd never believe it
[1:25:24] like that
[1:25:26] not that he wouldn't believe it
[1:25:28] he just wouldn't want to believe it like
[1:25:30] that notice they didn't go oh you know
[1:25:32] what I accepted it but now I see what
[1:25:34] it's producing not for me no no what
[1:25:36] does the devil do he hybrids it
[1:25:40] he says I'll take all of this and I'll
[1:25:42] leave out the that and I want all of
[1:25:44] this but I don't want any of that and
[1:25:46] I'll take some of this but I don't want
[1:25:48] any of that
[1:25:49] I want a cultured polished nice
[1:25:52] feel-good Vibes in my church nice
[1:25:54] feel-good sermons
[1:25:56] you know what because people with
[1:25:59] itching ears want that
[1:26:03] but there's a humble little group of
[1:26:05] people
[1:26:06] who've been anointed by the supernatural
[1:26:08] that says I'm not looking for the fancy
[1:26:10] I'm not looking for the big Steeples I
[1:26:13] want the supernatural anointing of God I
[1:26:15] want the power of God I want the reality
[1:26:18] of Jesus oh how many could raise a hand
[1:26:21] and say that's what I'm expecting that's
[1:26:23] what I'm looking for Lord doesn't matter
[1:26:25] if it's got to be in a dingy little
[1:26:27] place where people are shouting and
[1:26:29] speaking in tongues and dancing I'm not
[1:26:31] going to be ashamed of it it's who I am
[1:26:33] I've got my identity here this is all
[1:26:36] that I am I can't fit in in the world
[1:26:38] this is the only place among the only
[1:26:41] people that I fit in it's the only group
[1:26:44] that I'm comfortable around why because
[1:26:47] I've been translated I've got a
[1:26:49] supernatural anointing
[1:26:51] Hallelujah
[1:26:54] thank you they begin to get together and
[1:26:56] to think now we'll form something a
[1:26:58] little different Jesus right at me left
[1:26:59] to the first church age you told them
[1:27:01] the second chapter of Revelations I have
[1:27:02] somewhat against you because these Deeds
[1:27:04] of the Nicolaitans Nico conquer the
[1:27:06] laity in other words they want me to
[1:27:08] make instead of everybody be one they
[1:27:10] want me to make some holy fella they
[1:27:12] wanted to make some kind they put in the
[1:27:13] pattern after paganism for what they had
[1:27:15] come from they finally done it now watch
[1:27:16] first nicolaitan the nicolaitan was
[1:27:19] called in the Bible Antichrist because
[1:27:21] it was against the original doctrine of
[1:27:23] Christ and the apostles what sinful man
[1:27:27] could there be today that could look in
[1:27:30] the face of the Bible and see if the
[1:27:32] Holy Spirit isn't The Interpreter of the
[1:27:34] word today making himself known by
[1:27:37] manifestations of promises of the gifts
[1:27:41] and the things he promised to do in this
[1:27:43] day Malachi 4 being fulfilled all the
[1:27:47] rest of the scriptures being fulfilled
[1:27:49] and see we're right act the end time you
[1:27:54] don't need any man to interpret it no
[1:27:56] sir it interprets itself it proves it's
[1:28:00] the message of the hour
[1:28:03] what was it to bring a supernatural why
[1:28:06] did we read Galatians chapter 3 back to
[1:28:09] our text and we'll close all you foolish
[1:28:12] Galatians
[1:28:13] are you so foolish listen to me
[1:28:17] are you so foolish
[1:28:19] having begun
[1:28:21] in the spirit
[1:28:24] this is how the church started
[1:28:27] this is how God began this is your your
[1:28:29] origin this is your Genesis and it
[1:28:32] starts in the spirit and you think that
[1:28:35] now you can become perfected by the
[1:28:37] flesh
[1:28:38] it's the same exact reason why churches
[1:28:41] today are ashamed of Jehovah of the Old
[1:28:43] Testament they love Jesus of the new the
[1:28:45] Jesus that loves and sits and forgives
[1:28:49] I love that Jesus too
[1:28:51] but I want all of the Gospel I don't
[1:28:54] just want his care what if some of some
[1:28:56] what some story somebody told me I
[1:28:58] wanted Paul said to know him and the
[1:29:00] power of his resurrection
[1:29:02] they they're ashamed it's an
[1:29:04] embarrassment it's it's an embarrassment
[1:29:08] I'm preaching to you on anointed by the
[1:29:10] supernatural the Supernatural is an
[1:29:12] embarrassment to them
[1:29:16] it's an embarrassment
[1:29:18] so they turn their churches into feel
[1:29:20] good Comfort zones where sin is never
[1:29:22] mentioned in people's dress and how they
[1:29:24] live
[1:29:25] and people's consciences are dulled
[1:29:28] listen to me friends it's the same exact
[1:29:30] way the intellectual mind without a
[1:29:32] burning bush experience will always view
[1:29:35] the messages rules regulations and codes
[1:29:39] and bondage you've got to have a burning
[1:29:42] bush experience
[1:29:43] [Applause]
[1:29:47] it's the same way the intellectually
[1:29:49] minded man will always always always
[1:29:52] take the way of Cain
[1:29:55] always accept the way of worship that's
[1:29:57] beautiful and pretty
[1:29:59] and reject the blood
[1:30:02] and the bloody mess
[1:30:05] because it's an embarrassment I'm
[1:30:06] closing
[1:30:10] how are you so foolish
[1:30:14] having begun in the spirit and are now
[1:30:17] made perfect by the flesh let me say
[1:30:19] this as I wrote it down as the Lord just
[1:30:20] inspired me are we so foolish in the
[1:30:23] message of the hour
[1:30:24] having begun in the Supernatural are we
[1:30:28] now made perfect by the natural
[1:30:31] is it about a perform a pressure to
[1:30:34] perform is it about our performance of
[1:30:36] how we check off everything that we did
[1:30:38] this week and and we do this week listen
[1:30:40] friends you say brother Matt I would I
[1:30:41] you know I I I'm not I'm with you here
[1:30:44] you know brother Matt I don't believe
[1:30:46] it's by natural you know I don't believe
[1:30:47] it's by intellect I'm not talking about
[1:30:49] that right do we believe that it's up to
[1:30:52] us to perfect us
[1:30:54] do we believe that it's some behavior
[1:30:56] that we learn or that we live every day
[1:30:58] and if we we're a good boy long enough
[1:31:00] and certainly we'll have a body change
[1:31:02] listen if you started in the
[1:31:04] Supernatural then the body change will
[1:31:06] have to be the same way it'll have to be
[1:31:10] nothing that you've done apart from
[1:31:12] yourself it'll have to be grace that
[1:31:15] saved you and Grace that changes your
[1:31:17] body
[1:31:18] are we so foolish having begun in the
[1:31:21] Supernatural and now we're made perfect
[1:31:23] by the natural having begun I wrote this
[1:31:26] having begun
[1:31:28] the message of the hour to a simple
[1:31:31] uneducated
[1:31:34] illiterate
[1:31:36] seventh grade education
[1:31:38] having begun in the old-time religion
[1:31:41] with snotting and crying and screaming
[1:31:44] and pouring out our hearts to God in an
[1:31:46] altar now we're going to finish with a
[1:31:48] cultured refined dry-eyed people
[1:31:54] if it started that way it's got to
[1:31:57] finish that way it's a deceived Church
[1:32:00] by the world and I don't want to be
[1:32:01] deceived I want to say Lord you've
[1:32:03] started Us in the spirit let our church
[1:32:05] finish in the spirit have started with
[1:32:08] the supernatural how many can raise a
[1:32:09] hand stand to your feet and say Lord I
[1:32:12] want to finish with a supernatural
[1:32:14] expectation I want to believe from
[1:32:16] Miracles I want to believe for wonders I
[1:32:18] want to believe for signs that follow
[1:32:20] the believer I want to believe in the
[1:32:22] real baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:25] that gives an experience that changes
[1:32:27] that person
[1:32:30] musicians it's a definite real
[1:32:33] experience I'm not told that young
[1:32:34] person the other night I said it may not
[1:32:36] be shouting you may you may not you may
[1:32:39] not jump you may you may not dance you
[1:32:41] may
[1:32:43] but here's what will happen you know
[1:32:45] something
[1:32:47] got a hold of you
[1:32:49] and it's changed you
[1:32:53] it's changed you from this creature from
[1:32:55] that creature brother Brandon says here
[1:32:57] come uh I'll I'll save that let me not
[1:33:00] read that
[1:33:02] bow your heads with me if you could just
[1:33:04] play something if you guys to Ruth
[1:33:07] oh
[1:33:12] are you so foolish having begun in the
[1:33:15] spirit are now made perfect by the law
[1:33:18] or by the hearing of faith
[1:33:21] are you so foolish having begun in the
[1:33:23] spirit
[1:33:24] now made perfect by the flesh
[1:33:30] he therefore that ministereth to you the
[1:33:34] spirit
[1:33:35] and worketh miracles among you
[1:33:39] doth he do it by The Works of the law or
[1:33:41] by the hearing of faith
[1:33:43] no you therefore that they which are
[1:33:45] Faith the same are the children of
[1:33:49] Abraham
[1:33:50] we are the children of faith I want to
[1:33:53] say Lord let me be a child of Faith how
[1:33:57] many could raise a hand say Lord let me
[1:34:00] be a child born of the supernatural let
[1:34:05] me be Lord not just how I was born but
[1:34:07] let me live my life under an anointing
[1:34:11] for a purpose an anointing listen those
[1:34:14] things got to be transferred as we
[1:34:15] preached on the expectation that was
[1:34:18] upon brother branham's heart
[1:34:20] right before he passes away has to be
[1:34:22] the same expectation that's transferred
[1:34:25] to the bride
[1:34:26] that same expectation not to see an
[1:34:29] intellectual not to see just a dry-eyed
[1:34:31] confession but to see a real living
[1:34:34] moving spirit that has free reign and
[1:34:38] freedom in his people and in this church
[1:34:40] how many could say I want that for me
[1:34:43] I want that for my family I want that
[1:34:46] for my life
[1:34:48] listen to what brother Brandon says here
[1:34:50] and I don't want you to just keep your
[1:34:52] head bowed every eye closed this is the
[1:34:55] message and what house will you build me
[1:34:57] into November 21st just a few days
[1:35:00] now it's November 9th 1965. I know that
[1:35:04] each of you if you feel like I do
[1:35:07] I am so hungry
[1:35:10] to see the spirit of God moving
[1:35:13] I wonder if that just resonate with
[1:35:16] someone's heart here tonight
[1:35:18] brother Brandon's prayer he says I know
[1:35:20] that each one of you if you feel like I
[1:35:22] do I am so hungry to see the spirit of
[1:35:26] God moving I just can't hardly stand it
[1:35:30] I'm raising my hand saying that's what
[1:35:32] I'm hungry for Lord I'm so hungry to see
[1:35:35] the spirit of God moving that I just
[1:35:38] can't hardly stand it
[1:35:41] Sometimes some experiences I've had just
[1:35:44] up in the mountain just to feel that
[1:35:45] once again
[1:35:46] that's something that when I first was
[1:35:49] saved was So Glorious in my heart
[1:35:51] and we can come into a place we can sit
[1:35:54] and we can see it among us that we're
[1:35:57] drying
[1:35:58] as we sit here in the desert I get among
[1:36:00] my brother and they talk with me and I
[1:36:02] talk with them always in a little way of
[1:36:03] watching filling out there with the
[1:36:05] spirit as it was to see the condition of
[1:36:07] the brother to see what's wrong I begin
[1:36:10] to fill us all reclining
[1:36:12] getting away from the spirit oh God let
[1:36:15] it not be us he says I begin to fill us
[1:36:19] reclining
[1:36:20] it's become too natural a thing to us
[1:36:25] my goodness
[1:36:27] every head doubt ever I closed when I
[1:36:30] read those words
[1:36:33] I thought Lord don't let me be guilty
[1:36:36] don't let me I'm raising my hand say
[1:36:37] Lord don't let me be guilty
[1:36:40] of reclining back getting away from the
[1:36:43] spirit don't let it become such a
[1:36:45] natural thing to us brother Brandon says
[1:36:48] we must Worship in the spirit where the
[1:36:50] spirit of God is Not only our message
[1:36:52] should be the flame of the hour it
[1:36:55] should be the flame of our hearts
[1:36:58] oh did you hear that it's not just the
[1:37:00] message of the hours the message of my
[1:37:02] heart it's the message of my cry it's
