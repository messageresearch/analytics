[26:22] like to earlier in the week but i don't
[26:25] know i was just kind of mostly going on
[26:27] faith and uh
[26:28] there's something turning inside me and
[26:32] i couldn't
[26:32] put my finger on it until today and
[26:36] uh went and met with the brother had a
[26:38] lengthy conversation not the first one
[26:40] we've had mind you
[26:42] concerning it so what you're about to

[28:12] for a little while bowed my head
[28:14] later you know earlier today in the

[30:49] man friends it's it's an honor to be up
[30:51] here standing in front of you guys
[30:52] tonight
[30:53] uh as pastor was saying you know i felt
[30:56] the call on the lord
[30:58] in the past few months it just has been
[31:01] every single day it's all that i can
[31:03] think about
[31:04] and so last week i asked for a meeting
[31:08] with our pastor and i just said you know
[31:10] i just would like to talk to you and get
[31:12] your spiritual guidance on it
[31:13] and we were in the meeting and i had
[31:16] absolutely
[31:17] no idea that he would ask me to preach
[31:19] tonight
[31:20] and um he was like you know i was just
[31:24] feeling
[31:24] the spirit of the lord and he said he
[31:27] just the events were lining up and
[31:29] and he said he said what do you want to
[31:32] do i said i want to go home and i want
[31:34] to study
[31:35] so i went home and first thing i did is
[31:38] i got in my car
[31:39] and i just wept like a little baby and
[31:43] the lord just moved upon me so i just
[31:45] want to share this thought that i have
[31:46] with you guys tonight
[31:48] and if you just want to open up your
[31:51] bibles
[31:52] to first kings chapter 20.
[32:02] the thought tonight we're gonna take is
[32:04] uh about king ahab
[32:06] um in the syrian army
[32:12] say amen when you're there man awesome
[32:17] verse 1 and it says we're going to read
[32:18] down to verse 12 and it says and benedad
[32:20] the king of syria
[32:22] gathered all his hosts together and
[32:25] there were 30 and two kings with him
[32:27] and horses and chariots and he went up
[32:30] and besieged samaria
[32:31] and ward against it and he sent
[32:33] messengers to ahab king of israel into
[32:36] the city
[32:36] and he said unto him thus saith benidad
[32:39] thy silver and thy gold is mine
[32:42] thy wives also and thy children even the
[32:45] goodliest are mine
[32:46] and the king of israel answered and said
[32:48] my king
[32:50] or my lord o king according to thy
[32:52] saying i am thine
[32:53] and all that i have and the messengers
[32:55] came again and said
[32:57] thus speaketh been a dad saying although
[32:59] i have sent unto thee saying thou shalt
[33:01] deliver me thy silver and thy gold and
[33:03] thy wives and thy children
[33:04] yet i will send my servants unto thee
[33:06] tomorrow about this time
[33:08] and they shall search thine house and
[33:10] the house of thy servants and it shall
[33:11] be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine
[33:13] eyes they shall put it at their hand
[33:15] and take it away then the king of israel
[33:18] called all the elders of
[33:19] the land and said mark i pray you and
[33:22] see how this man seeketh mischief
[33:24] for he sent unto me my wives and for my
[33:26] children and for my silver and my gold
[33:28] and i denied him not and all the elders
[33:31] and all the people said unto him hearken
[33:33] not unto him
[33:34] nor consent wherefore he sent unto the
[33:37] messengers of benedad
[33:38] tell my lord the king all that thou did
[33:40] send for me to thy servant at the first
[33:42] and i will do
[33:43] but this but this thing i may not do and
[33:46] the messengers departed
[33:47] and brought him word again and bennet
[33:50] had said unto him the gods do so unto me
[33:53] and more also
[33:54] if the dust of samaria shall suffice for
[33:56] handfuls of all the people that follow
[33:58] me
[33:58] and the king of israel answered and said
[34:00] tell him let him not that girdeth on his
[34:02] harness boasts himself as that putteth
[34:04] it off
[34:05] and it came to pass when
[34:09] benedict heard this message as he was
[34:11] drinking he and the kings and the
[34:12] pavilion
[34:13] said unto his servant set yourselves in
[34:15] a ray and they set themselves in a ray
[34:17] against the city
[34:18] amen let's let's bow our heads dear
[34:21] precious heavenly father lord god
[34:23] we're gathered here tonight father god

[34:34] god lord you see the desire that you put
[34:36] upon my heart father
[34:38] lord it's just it's a privilege to be up
[34:41] here to be able to
[34:42] lord pour my heart out to these people
[34:44] tonight lord i pray that you can bless

[34:48] can just

[34:51] that you can help me get out of the way

[34:54] lord i leave me and all my spirit at
[34:56] home lord and i just pray that the
[34:58] spirit of jesus christ can come

[35:01] tonight father god lord i love you and i
[35:04] appreciate you and i ask all these
[35:05] things in the mighty precious name of
[35:07] jesus christ
[35:08] amen you can have your seats
[35:12] so tonight we're talking about king ahab
[35:14] in the syrian army so at that
[35:16] at this time um the the king of israel
[35:20] was king ahab and the king of syria
[35:23] was king binadad um
[35:26] now king ahab so i want to just lay some
[35:28] background now to what happened in
[35:30] previous chapters
[35:32] in in previous chapters in chapter 18
[35:35] um elijah goes to ahab
[35:39] and i'm just going to start in verse 1.
[35:41] it says it came to pass after many days
[35:43] the word of the lord came
[35:44] unto elijah the third year saying go and
[35:46] show thyself unto hahab and i will send
[35:48] rain upon the earth
[35:49] and elijah showed himself unto ahab and
[35:51] there was famine in samaria
[35:53] and ahab called obadiah which was the
[35:55] governor of his house
[35:56] now obadiah feared the lord greatly so
[35:59] ahab was in his house
[36:01] um and you'll see here in the next few
[36:03] verses we're going to talk about
[36:04] uh in verse three and verse four well
[36:07] let's go ahead and read it and ahab
[36:08] called obadiah which was the governor of
[36:09] his house
[36:10] and obadiah feared the lord greatly and
[36:12] for it was so when jezebel cut off the
[36:14] prophets of the lord
[36:15] that obadiah took a hundred prophets and
[36:17] hid them by 50 in a cave
[36:18] and fed them with bread and water so
[36:20] what happened was
[36:21] is jezebel cut off the the prophets they
[36:24] they were sinning against the lord
[36:26] and um and ahab took the prophets of
[36:30] jesus christ and he
[36:31] they they sent him out and oh but since
[36:34] obadiah even though he was the governor
[36:35] of ahab's house
[36:37] he he feared the lord greatly thank you
[36:40] he feared the lord greatly and so he he
[36:42] hid them in their house
[36:43] and it goes on to say that
[36:47] it goes on to say that as obadiah was in
[36:49] the way in verse 7
[36:52] elijah met him and he knew and he fell
[36:54] on his face and said art thou my lord
[36:56] elijah
[36:56] so uh since since
[36:59] the prophets were sent out from
[37:03] the the kingdom of ahab obadiah
[37:06] saw elijah and saw what was going on and
[37:09] he was
[37:09] he was so afraid and he said why are you
[37:11] here what's going on
[37:13] and and at this time jezebel
[37:17] actually had the servants or the the
[37:19] prophets of baal in her house around her
[37:21] table so she was sinning greatly against
[37:23] the lord
[37:25] and so elijah uses a crafty technique
[37:27] here and he says
[37:29] in verse in verse 8 and he said i i am
[37:32] tell thy lord behold elijah is here
[37:34] and he said what have i sinned that thou
[37:36] would just deliver thy servant into the
[37:37] hand of ahab to slay me so what's going
[37:39] on here
[37:40] is ahab or is elijah wants
[37:43] obadiah to go into ahab and say
[37:46] hey you're not doing good with the lord
[37:49] basically he wants to set up a meeting
[37:50] with him
[37:51] okay he wants to he wants to set up a
[37:52] meeting but he knows that if he goes
[37:54] into that house
[37:55] that he's not going to be able to have
[37:57] that meeting because jezebel kicked them
[37:59] out
[37:59] and they were and they were hated in
[38:01] that house so he
[38:02] was crafty in his ways and like the lord
[38:05] is always crafty in his ways and he sent
[38:07] obadiah which
[38:08] in in earlier verses says i fee that he
[38:10] feared the lord greatly
[38:12] and obadiah was he was still afraid he
[38:14] said he said as the lord lie liveth
[38:16] um he said in verse sign i am to go in
[38:19] verse eight behold elijah is here and he
[38:21] said what have i sinned that thou
[38:22] wouldest deliver thy servant into ahab
[38:24] to slay me so he was afraid
[38:26] and verse 11 and now says go and tell
[38:28] the lord behold elijah is here and it
[38:30] came to pass as soon as i am gone from
[38:32] thee
[38:32] that the spirit of the lord carry thee
[38:34] whether i know and so when i come to
[38:36] tell ahab that he cannot find thee he
[38:37] shall slay me
[38:39] and that thy servant but i thy servant
[38:42] fear the lord from thy youth
[38:43] and was it not told the lord that when
[38:45] jezebel slew the prophet to the lord
[38:47] how i hid a hundred men of the lord's
[38:48] prophets by 50 in a cave
[38:50] and fed them with bread and with water
[38:54] and so he's explaining you know like i i
[38:56] know that
[38:57] i know that the jezebel sinned and i
[38:59] know that jezebel
[39:01] hates the prophets uh so why would you
[39:04] why would you go into
[39:05] to have me killed and elijah said
[39:07] basically saying you're not going to be
[39:08] killed you're you're the governor of his
[39:09] house
[39:10] so and and he promises him here he said
[39:12] elijah's here and he shall slay me and
[39:14] elijah said as the lord of the host
[39:15] liveth
[39:16] whom before whom i stand i will surely
[39:18] show myself unto him today
[39:20] so obadiah went to meet ahab and told
[39:22] him and ahab went to meet elijah so
[39:24] he successfully set up the meeting with
[39:26] between between
[39:28] elijah and ahab which which which was a
[39:31] difficult task okay so we move on
[39:33] and in the next verses uh elijah in
[39:36] verse 17 and it came to pass when ahab
[39:38] saw elijah
[39:38] abs said unto him art thou that he that
[39:40] troubles israel and he answered i have
[39:42] not troubled israel but thou and thy
[39:44] father's house
[39:45] in the ea have forsaken the commandments
[39:47] of the lord and and thou has followed
[39:48] balaam so he's saying
[39:50] that was forsaken the lord that was
[39:52] forsaken what the lord has said to do
[39:54] and and your wife jezebel kicked out all
[39:57] of
[39:57] all of the servants of the lord and and
[40:00] you're
[40:00] and you're you're sitting against the
[40:02] lord and he and now followed balaam a
[40:04] false prophet
[40:05] now therefore sinned in verse 19 sinned
[40:07] and gathered to me all israel unto mount
[40:08] carmel and all the prophets
[40:10] of baal 450 and the prophets of the
[40:12] grove 400. so
[40:13] th this next this next little excerpt
[40:17] we're really familiar with it's it's
[40:18] uh it's a sunday school sunday school
[40:21] story that we're all really
[40:23] familiar with when ahab said on the
[40:25] children of israel and gathered up all
[40:26] the prophets into mount carmel
[40:28] and elijah challenged the prophets of
[40:29] baal and he came unto all the people
[40:32] verse 21 how long hath thou shalt be in
[40:35] two opinions
[40:36] if if if the lord be god follow him
[40:39] but of baal then follow him amen and the
[40:42] people answered him not a word and then
[40:44] elijah said unto the people
[40:45] i even i remain a prophet of the lord
[40:48] but baal's prophets are 450 men
[40:51] against one man and it was and it was
[40:54] elijah and let them therefore give us
[40:56] two bullets
[40:57] and let them choose one bullock for
[40:58] themselves and cut into pieces and lay
[41:00] it on the wood and put no fire under
[41:01] so so he has them and he hasn't we're
[41:04] gonna
[41:05] we're gonna paraphrase here he has him
[41:06] go down in and he has them
[41:09] do whatever they need to do to call on
[41:11] their name on their lord on their god on
[41:13] their prophet bail
[41:14] to to come and bring fire upon upon and
[41:17] they started danting and they started
[41:18] doing all kinds of things and they
[41:19] started
[41:20] sacrificing and cutting themselves and
[41:22] and the prophets of baal they couldn't
[41:23] do it they they could not call on the
[41:25] name of baal
[41:25] to send fire upon us so afterwards he
[41:28] said
[41:29] elijah said he has such faith in his god
[41:32] he said well take the wood that was
[41:33] supposed
[41:34] to be burned and soak it three times i
[41:35] mean we're all familiar with the story
[41:37] amen right
[41:37] so he said soak it three times so that
[41:41] so that there's no misunderstanding that
[41:43] the lord
[41:44] my god that will come and will consume
[41:46] this
[41:47] is it is fire they will the lord will
[41:49] consume and it is there is no shadow of
[41:51] a doubt
[41:52] in anybody's mind that it was the lord
[41:54] so they did this thing
[41:55] and it came to pass let's uh let's go on
[41:58] down
[41:59] um they they cried so in verse 28 and 29
[42:03] they were crying unto their lord till
[42:04] the blood gushed out upon them and it
[42:06] came to pass when the
[42:07] midday was passed all day and all night
[42:10] there was no voice
[42:11] nothing to answer none that regarded
[42:14] amen
[42:15] and elijah said unto all the people come
[42:17] near unto me and all the people came
[42:18] near unto him
[42:19] and he repaired the altar that was
[42:20] broken so they had broken the altar
[42:22] and elijah took the 12 stones and he
[42:24] built it and upon two measures of seed
[42:27] and we're just going to keep moving on
[42:29] hear me oh lord so in verse 36 and it
[42:31] came to pass
[42:32] at the time of the offering of the
[42:33] evening sacrifice that elijah the
[42:35] prophet came near
[42:36] and said to the lord god of abraham
[42:38] isaac and of israel let it be known this
[42:40] day that thou
[42:41] art the god in israel and that i am thy
[42:44] servant and that i have done
[42:46] all of these things at thy word amen
[42:48] that's such an awesome
[42:50] hear me o lord that this people may know
[42:52] that thou art the lord god that thou has
[42:54] turned their heart back again
[42:55] then the fire fell and consumed the
[42:58] burnt sacrifice
[42:59] imagine what it felt like to be elijah
[43:01] and to to see
[43:02] he knew he knows we know he that the
[43:05] lord is the most high god
[43:07] but to have him to have him come down
[43:09] and consume a sacrifice it's
[43:11] it takes faith they they he saw that
[43:13] baal wouldn't do it
[43:14] and it bales a false god and that they
[43:16] saw that
[43:17] and but it takes such faith for elijah
[43:19] to do it he does it and the lord
[43:20] consumes it with fire when all the
[43:22] people saw
[43:23] amen in verse 38 and the fire fell the
[43:26] the lord fell and consumed the burnt
[43:28] sacrifice and the wood and the stones
[43:29] and the dust and licked up the water
[43:31] that was in the trench
[43:32] and when all the people saw it they fell
[43:34] on their face and said
[43:35] that the lord he is god amen the lord he
[43:39] is god
[43:40] and elijah said unto them take unto the
[43:41] prophets of baal and not one of them
[43:43] escaped so he ended up killing all of
[43:44] the prophets of baal
[43:45] and he went on he goes on to mount
[43:47] carmel and let's um
[43:49] let's go on into into chapter 19. we're
[43:52] just trying to lay a foundation here
[43:53] friends so just just
[43:54] stick with me in chapter 19 um jehovah's
[43:57] tender hand
[43:58] um ahab so in the very first verse ahab
[44:01] goes and tells jezebel what had happened
[44:03] he goes and says to what elijah had done
[44:06] and with all and how he had slain all
[44:07] the prophets of the sword well can you
[44:08] imagine how enraged
[44:10] that that made jezebel because jezebel
[44:12] was the one who kicked out the prophets
[44:13] of the lord
[44:14] and he's the one who or and she's the
[44:16] one who
[44:17] wanted the prophets of baal to be around
[44:19] their house and around their kingdom
[44:21] in their kingdom and then jezebel sent a
[44:23] messenger unto elijah saying and i just
[44:26] can imagine the rage that she's saying
[44:27] this with senate messenger
[44:28] so let the gods do to me and moreover if
[44:31] i make not thy life as the life of one
[44:33] of them by tomorrow at this time so she
[44:35] said
[44:36] if you stay in this kingdom if you be
[44:38] anywhere where i know you can be
[44:40] then i'm going to take and i'm going to
[44:42] do what you did to those prophets and
[44:43] i'm going to do it to you
[44:44] i'm going to kill you and this is when
[44:46] elijah
[44:48] this is when elijah has uh you know he
[44:50] goes into the wilderness and he's scared
[44:52] for his life
[44:52] because you know he did this for the
[44:54] lord and then
[44:56] let's just put ourselves in elijah's
[44:57] shoes for just a second and and just see
[44:59] the lord called him to do this thing and
[45:01] he did this thing and the lord he came
[45:03] down
[45:03] and he consumed it with fire and just
[45:05] imagine just the glory that he was
[45:07] feeling that night
[45:08] oh man it was such an exciting thing for
[45:10] it to be right and then he comes in the
[45:12] very next
[45:12] day or week or however long it was and
[45:15] jezebel said
[45:16] how he had sent this message unto him
[45:18] saying well it's
[45:19] what exactly what you did to those
[45:20] prophets well i'm going to do exactly
[45:22] that thing to you so i'm going to kill
[45:23] you so he was scared he was afraid
[45:25] and we all get in that place i mean
[45:26] everybody gets afraid amen
[45:28] and so we so we're going to move on down
[45:30] so he goes in the wilderness and elijah
[45:32] at horror but he rose and he did eat and
[45:33] he'd drink
[45:34] so he he was this is this is a a
[45:37] whole nother topic in and of itself but
[45:40] they'll but the angel of the lord
[45:41] when he was in his weakness he said that
[45:44] that you need to that you need to rise
[45:45] up
[45:46] and you need to go back and you need to
[45:48] do this thing and i eat and because the
[45:51] journey is great for him
[45:52] for you and in verse eight he goes and
[45:55] he eats and he drinks
[45:56] and he goes and spends 40 days and
[45:58] nights into whoreb the mount of god and
[45:59] he comes hither into a cave
[46:01] and he lodged there and he says what
[46:02] dust out here and we're going to move on
[46:04] down
[46:05] and
[46:09] and i'm not skipping these verses
[46:10] because they're not important because
[46:13] this these are awesome verses in verse
[46:15] 11 it's because god wasn't in
[46:17] god wasn't in an earthquake god wasn't
[46:19] in he wasn't in
[46:20] um he wasn't in a fire he wasn't in the
[46:22] wind
[46:23] um but he was in the still small voice
[46:26] amen that's such an awesome scripture
[46:27] that is
[46:28] but we're but we're moving on and when
[46:30] it was when elijah heard he wrapped his
[46:31] face on his mantle and he stood out and
[46:33] entered the cave
[46:34] um in verse 14 and said i have been very
[46:36] jealous for the lord god of hosts
[46:37] because of the children has forsaken thy
[46:39] covenant
[46:39] and thrown down thy altars and slain thy
[46:41] prophets with the sword
[46:42] so so elijah was was enraged for the
[46:44] lord because of all these things that
[46:46] that
[46:47] what that had happened in the kingdom so
[46:49] he was he was afraid he was
[46:50] he was jealous for the lord as it says
[46:52] he was enraged for the lord he was
[46:54] he was upset that the the the kingdom of
[46:56] israel the lord's people
[46:57] had done this thing so he goes on and
[47:00] the lord said unto him go and return
[47:01] under the wilderness of damascus
[47:03] and in verse 15 16 17 and 18 um
[47:07] um he calls he calls on
[47:10] uh calls on a lie elisha which is going
[47:13] to be his successor
[47:14] right so in chapter 20 which which was
[47:17] the text that we started with
[47:19] we now have so now we kind of see a
[47:21] little backstory to what was going on so
[47:23] we
[47:23] so now we're at verse 20 and benedict
[47:25] the king of syria gathered all of his
[47:26] hosts together so we have the syrian
[47:28] army
[47:28] so let's paint a picture of this friends
[47:30] the the syrian army was huge in number
[47:32] it doesn't have a number exactly but it
[47:34] was huge in number later on in the
[47:36] scriptures it says it
[47:37] it it was as if it was as if the
[47:39] israelite army in comparison
[47:41] to the syrian army was like two children
[47:43] it was just it was so small
[47:45] and so so the syrian army so so ahab
[47:48] king ahab was he was afraid for this
[47:50] so what happened was is he there was
[47:53] basically like a treaty between the king
[47:55] of syria and the king of ahab
[47:56] and he said and but the treaty was it
[47:58] was an unfair treaty and it was
[47:59] disrespectful to the lord god
[48:00] and it and the treaty was basically
[48:02] saying that thy silver and thy gold is
[48:04] mine
[48:05] thy wives and also thy children are mine
[48:07] and even the goodliest are mine so that
[48:09] was the treaty
[48:10] so the the treaty is i'm gonna take
[48:12] anything that you
[48:13] anything that you have that is good and
[48:15] you know that's it because i'm greater
[48:17] than you
[48:17] so that's disrespectful to the lord he
[48:20] wasn't going to have that so we move on
[48:21] let's move on
[48:22] down into the verses and all the so and
[48:25] he moves down and
[48:26] finally in verse 5 and the messengers
[48:28] came again and said
[48:30] and speak thus speaketh benedict saying
[48:32] although i have sent unto thee saying
[48:33] that thou shalt deliver me the silver
[48:34] and thy gold and thy wives and thy
[48:36] children
[48:37] yet i will send my servants unto thee
[48:38] tomorrow about this time
[48:40] and they shall search thine house and
[48:42] the houses of thy servants and it shall
[48:43] be that whatsoever is pleasant in mine
[48:45] eyes they shall put in their hand and
[48:48] take away
[48:48] so here let me go ahead and change the
[48:50] treaty a little bit more and
[48:51] now not only am i going to take your
[48:53] wives and your children and your silver
[48:55] and your gold and whatever i want
[48:56] i'm going to go into any of your houses
[48:58] and i'm going to take whatever i want
[49:00] whatever i see fit so that's now that
[49:02] treaty has completely changed and
[49:04] finally ahab which
[49:05] ahab is already a sinful king he already
[49:07] has allowed a um he already
[49:09] has allowed jezebel to to uh
[49:12] let the prophets of baal into the house
[49:13] and kick the prophets of
[49:15] jehovah out okay so there's already that
[49:18] mark on him
[49:19] and now he's he's kind of being a
[49:20] pushover king
[49:22] israel doesn't need a pushover king
[49:24] that's that's they need a king that'll
[49:26] stand up for
[49:27] for what what's right and finally he
[49:29] says he finally had enough
[49:30] finally he was says then the king of
[49:32] israel called all the elders of the land
[49:33] and said mark i pray you
[49:35] and see how this man seeketh mischief
[49:37] for he sent unto me
[49:38] for he sent unto me for my wives and my
[49:41] children and for my silver and for my
[49:42] gold and i denied him not
[49:44] he denied him not not one time he denied
[49:46] him he said okay yeah i'll take this
[49:48] treaty because he knew the syrian army
[49:49] was great so he was
[49:50] slightly afraid okay sometimes we get
[49:53] afraid friends like i'm
[49:55] sometimes we you know there's something
[49:56] at trial in our life or something
[49:58] happening and we get afraid because you
[49:59] know the enemy seems so big
[50:01] well the lord is greater he is he is
[50:04] greater he
[50:05] we don't we don't need big armies and
[50:07] and flashy
[50:08] armies but all the elders and all the
[50:10] people said unto him hearken not unto
[50:12] him nor consent so i want to just paint
[50:14] this picture for a second okay so i was
[50:15] thinking about this and i don't know how
[50:17] you guys are when you read the
[50:18] scriptures but
[50:18] i like to just kind of just take my time
[50:21] and just look at it and elders and all
[50:22] the people so all
[50:23] imagine these are these are the elders
[50:25] where you know those wives and those
[50:27] children
[50:28] they're probably their wives and their
[50:30] children can you imagine people coming
[50:31] into your home and taking your wives and
[50:33] your children everything that you've
[50:34] worked for
[50:35] and and and then the israel and the king
[50:37] of israel just says yeah they can take
[50:38] it
[50:39] and then they finally go to him and they
[50:41] say well
[50:43] they finally come to him and say listen
[50:45] this has got to stop they have
[50:47] i have recognizes it and the and the
[50:49] elders were i
[50:50] i would imagine it would be enraged i
[50:52] would be enraged amen would you be
[50:54] amen i would be and all the elders said
[50:56] i am hearken not unto him nor
[50:57] consent amen so he said wherefore he
[51:00] sent unto the messengers of benadab and
[51:01] tell the lord my king all that thou
[51:03] didst to thy servant
[51:04] at the first will i do but this thing
[51:06] may not do and the messengers departed
[51:08] and brought him word again
[51:10] amen and the we're going to skip this
[51:12] verse and um and
[51:14] verse 11 and the king of israel answered
[51:15] and tell him let him not gird
[51:17] thy harness and boast itself and it came
[51:19] to pass when benad heard this message

[54:17] could be and they did a biopsy and
[54:19] and they you know they he put me on
[54:20] medication and and
[54:22] i went through all the steps and i just
[54:24] i accepted that and for the past two
[54:25] years
[54:26] i've just been kind of living in in this
[54:28] in this this state of pain all the time
[54:30] and um it's something that the lord has
[54:33] really i just i wasn't i wasn't sure i
[54:35] came up for prayer and i
[54:37] you know i was really just believing in
[54:38] the lord but at the same time that i was
[54:40] doing all that at that same time that i
[54:42] was praying and believing
[54:43] i was i was accepting it i was you know
[54:45] oh i ha
[54:46] you know i have this ailment and i'm

[55:01] and i just i just wasn't having it

[55:45] confession and i've confessed him as my
[55:47] healer amen
[55:48] i've confessed him as my healer
[55:53] said can you eat i said sure every time
[55:55] i've seen i take a drink of water it
[55:56] spurt through my nose she settled back
[55:58] there looking at me and know what what
[55:59] the truth she said what do you want i
[56:01] said send over the store so
[56:03] so it's gotten to a point in my life
[56:05] where you know i've i've
[56:07] tried to change my diet and to i i've
[56:09] just you know i just wanted
[56:11] you know i'm just going to eat oatmeal
[56:12] that's that doesn't seem to hurt my
[56:13] stomach let me just eat oatmeal
[56:15] and when just a little precursor the
[56:19] the devil tried to lie to me when he
[56:20] when he cooked that bioxy the biopsy the
[56:22] devil told me he said
[56:23] and the doctor said you know this this
[56:25] is technically a pre-cancerous
[56:27] condition and that word when it when it
[56:28] comes up it's so precancerous oh that
[56:30] kind of stirs a little something inside
[56:32] you're like
[56:33] oh i don't want to kind of say i don't i
[56:34] don't like that you know but that's what
[56:36] what's that
[56:37] what is that that's the devil's tactic
[56:39] he said he sends a greater ray in verse
[56:41] in verses 12.
[56:42] he sends a great array that's a great
[56:43] array amen
[56:45] he said he sent it that he sent that
[56:46] unto me and i was like you know what

[56:50] believe that the lord jesus christ is
[56:51] going to heal me
[56:52] and you know but i'm still going to i'm
[56:54] still going to just keep on eating
[56:56] just the oatmeal and i'm still going to

[1:04:28] was he absolutely not he was not worthy
[1:04:31] are we worthy no amen but guess what
[1:04:34] god's still going to do it because guess
[1:04:36] what
[1:04:37] who who who was he delivering he was
[1:04:39] delivering israel who is israel
[1:04:41] god's people amen who are we god's
[1:04:43] people
[1:04:44] right amen and he said ahead by whom and
[1:04:47] he said by thus saith the lord even by
[1:04:48] the young men
[1:04:49] of the princes of the provinces and he
[1:04:51] said who shall order the battle
[1:04:53] and he said thou can you imagine just
[1:04:56] thou thou shall order the battle you
[1:04:58] know you kicked me out
[1:05:00] you kicked me out of your kingdom you
[1:05:03] you've done terrible things you don't
[1:05:05] believe me you've you've allowed jezebel
[1:05:07] to kill my
[1:05:08] to kill my prophets but thou shalt order
[1:05:10] the battle because
[1:05:12] i love my people enough to deliver them
[1:05:15] amen
[1:05:16] amen he loves us enough to deliver us
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:20] so let's talk about some victories
[1:05:21] because i love talking about victories
[1:05:22] amen
[1:05:23] so this victory this first victory we
[1:05:25] have so
[1:05:26] actually let's take a step back so when
[1:05:29] i was when i was
[1:05:30] studying on on verse 14 the lord really
[1:05:33] he put it upon my heart to
[1:05:34] to um to to kind of do a little google
[1:05:38] search on it and and do some research on
[1:05:40] it
[1:05:40] and he brought me to this verse actually
[1:05:42] it was by accident
[1:05:44] because because of something that i'll
[1:05:46] go on in in
[1:05:47] into detail about later but he brought
[1:05:49] me to by accident
[1:05:50] and in jeremiah 1 you can turn that turn
[1:05:53] there if you want um
[1:05:54] jeremiah 1 we're going to read jeremiah
[1:05:56] verse 1. i'm actually
[1:05:58] i'm actually going to read it out of the
[1:05:59] rsv which is
[1:06:02] some other translation just that i
[1:06:03] thought and then i'll read it out of the
[1:06:05] king james version
[1:06:06] um and it says the words so
[1:06:09] back on the thought of how is the lord
[1:06:12] gonna use me as a young man
[1:06:14] how is he gonna use me and i know that i
[1:06:15] know the young people you know
[1:06:17] i have i'm sure you guys have that
[1:06:19] thought all the time like how how is the
[1:06:20] lord going to use me like
[1:06:21] you know am i supposed to what am i
[1:06:23] supposed to do how am i supposed to be a
[1:06:25] blessing to the lord
[1:06:26] and jeremiah had that same he had that
[1:06:28] same inkling he had that same
[1:06:30] desire how am i going to be used so
[1:06:31] let's read it and he said
[1:06:33] in the words we're just going to read
[1:06:34] one through nine it says the words of
[1:06:36] jeremiah the son of hilkiah of the
[1:06:37] priests who were in enough
[1:06:39] in the land of benjamin to whom the lord
[1:06:41] of the lord so this is the rsv so it
[1:06:42] might be a little different as
[1:06:44] as it's up there and it came to pass in
[1:06:46] the seventh day of
[1:06:47] uh jehoiakim the son of josiah the king
[1:06:49] of judah and until the end of the
[1:06:51] eleventh year of zedekiah the son of
[1:06:53] josiah king of judah
[1:06:54] until the captivity of jerusalem in the
[1:06:56] fifth month and now the word of the lord
[1:06:58] came unto me saying
[1:07:00] before so so i'm having these mind
[1:07:02] battles
[1:07:03] you shouldn't get up there you you know
[1:07:05] you don't need to be
[1:07:06] getting up there well you know lord i i
[1:07:08] i really i feel like this is what you're
[1:07:10] calling me to do
[1:07:12] you know and i just i i want to make
[1:07:14] sure that i'm in the perfect world of
[1:07:16] the lord
[1:07:16] and you know so read listen to this
[1:07:20] friends
[1:07:21] before i formed you in the womb i knew
[1:07:24] you
[1:07:25] before he formed us in the womb before
[1:07:27] we were alive before we had breath
[1:07:29] he knew us he knew each and every one of
[1:07:31] us amen and before you were born
[1:07:33] i consecrated you and i appointed you as
[1:07:36] a prophet to the nations
[1:07:38] and i said oh lord god behold i do not
[1:07:42] know how to speak
[1:07:43] for i am only a youth amen i got up
[1:07:45] there i was like
[1:07:46] oh i am only a youth amen
[1:07:50] amen i am only a youth i don't know how
[1:07:52] to speak i don't know how to get up and
[1:07:53] and preach to your people i don't i mean
[1:07:56] this is this is a sacred this is
[1:07:57] this is sacred you're the people that
[1:08:00] god chose to be the bride of christ
[1:08:02] you're gonna you're kings and rulers
[1:08:05] sitting among you guys
[1:08:07] how am i gonna get up here and and speak
[1:08:09] to you
[1:08:10] well the lord said before i formed you
[1:08:12] in the womb i knew you
[1:08:13] and before you were born i consecrated
[1:08:15] you and before
[1:08:17] you were a a messenger sent to the
[1:08:19] nations he was a prophet but
[1:08:21] were messengers sent to the nations amen
[1:08:23] and then i said oh lord god behold i do
[1:08:25] not know how to speak
[1:08:26] for i am only a youth but the lord said
[1:08:28] to me do not say that i am only a youth
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:31] for to all to whom i send you shall go
[1:08:35] amen and but whatever i command you
[1:08:37] shall speak
[1:08:38] be not afraid of them for i will i am
[1:08:41] with you to deliver you says the lord
[1:08:43] now i would just i was just holding that
[1:08:45] scripture close to my heart today
[1:08:46] because i was
[1:08:47] afraid that i was going to come out here
[1:08:49] and my wife was
[1:08:50] you know just giving me encouragement
[1:08:52] but i was afraid i was going to come out
[1:08:53] here
[1:08:54] and just not have anything to say and
[1:08:55] just i didn't know what you know but
[1:08:57] all day i've just been and i've been put
[1:09:00] pondering these words
[1:09:01] that i i that that i will
[1:09:05] where was i then the lord put forth his
[1:09:07] hand and said unto me i will put the
[1:09:08] words in your mouth amen
[1:09:10] i will put the words in your mouth
[1:09:11] praise the name of the lord he puts the
[1:09:13] words in our mouth
[1:09:14] so young people just just a side note
[1:09:16] for the young people the lord
[1:09:18] whatever it is that you're supposed to
[1:09:19] do the lord will the lord will lead you
[1:09:21] he consecrated you he appointed you to
[1:09:23] be a messenger to the nations each one
[1:09:24] of you you're a messenger to the nations
[1:09:26] so behold don't have to worry about it
[1:09:29] amen all right so let's move on
[1:09:31] um then he numbered the young men the
[1:09:33] princes of the provinces and they were
[1:09:35] 32 and he numbered all the people
[1:09:37] even all the children of israel being
[1:09:39] seven thousand amen so this is this is
[1:09:41] the this is going to be the very first
[1:09:43] victory that ahab wins over the syrian
[1:09:45] army
[1:09:45] so you have this great army of the
[1:09:48] syrians
[1:09:48] and you have um
[1:09:53] you have the the israelite army
[1:09:57] which is small in number and they were
[1:09:59] working out at noon but
[1:10:00] benadab was drinking himself drunk in
[1:10:02] the pavilions he and the kings the
[1:10:04] thirty and two kings that helped him
[1:10:05] and the young men of the princes the
[1:10:07] provinces went out first and binidad
[1:10:09] sent out and they told him saying
[1:10:11] these are the men of samaria and he said
[1:10:13] whether they be come out for peace
[1:10:14] take them alive amen what do they come
[1:10:18] out for peace take them alive
[1:10:19] or whether they come out for war take
[1:10:21] them alive for these young men of the
[1:10:23] princes are come out of the city
[1:10:24] and the army which followed them and
[1:10:26] they slew
[1:10:28] every one of his men and the syrians
[1:10:31] fled
[1:10:31] amen amen they were they were standing
[1:10:35] around him in greater ray
[1:10:36] but guess what they slew
[1:10:39] every one of them amen and the syrians
[1:10:42] fled
[1:10:43] and israel pursued them and benedict the
[1:10:45] king of syria escaped on a horse that's
[1:10:46] what happens you know sometimes the
[1:10:47] devil will come and
[1:10:48] he'll have these you know these great
[1:10:50] big you know muscular things
[1:10:52] that just just seem so scary in our
[1:10:55] lives
[1:10:55] pre-cancerous condition no it's
[1:10:58] absolutely not i don't accept that
[1:11:00] you're gonna flee devil you're under my
[1:11:02] feet amen he's under our feet right
[1:11:04] so when the king went out and and then
[1:11:06] he then he runs then he runs away
[1:11:08] that's what the devil does he's because
[1:11:09] he's scared and he's a chicken and he
[1:11:10] runs
[1:11:11] and he says israel pursued them and
[1:11:13] benedict the king of syria escaped on a
[1:11:15] horse with horsemen
[1:11:16] and the king of israel went out and
[1:11:17] smote the horses and chariots and slew
[1:11:19] the syrians with a great slaughter amen
[1:11:23] they were victorious that day praise the
[1:11:25] name of the lord and the prophet came to
[1:11:26] the king of israel and they said unto
[1:11:28] him go strengthen thyselves
[1:11:29] and mark for the return of the year of
[1:11:32] syria will come up against thee
[1:11:34] so i don't exactly know the time frame
[1:11:36] friends how long it take it took for
[1:11:38] this to happen
[1:11:39] um so just bear with me on that but amen
[1:11:42] they he it says that
[1:11:43] that they were going to come back and
[1:11:45] and do the same thing over again
[1:11:46] and then next the next verse and the
[1:11:48] servants of the king of syria said unto
[1:11:49] him
[1:11:50] their gods are the gods of the hills
[1:11:52] therefore they were stronger than we
[1:11:54] but let us fight against them in the
[1:11:55] plane and surely we shall go
[1:11:57] uh oh oh they they just they did
[1:12:00] something
[1:12:01] the servant said their gods are gods of
[1:12:03] the hills
[1:12:05] you don't you don't disrespect god like
[1:12:07] that
[1:12:08] they're gods of the hills they're not
[1:12:10] they're not they're not going to be gods
[1:12:11] in the valleys
[1:12:13] god my god is the god of the hills and
[1:12:15] the valleys amen
[1:12:16] he's the god of everything amen praise
[1:12:19] the name of the lord and they were
[1:12:20] stronger than we but we let
[1:12:22] we let us fight against them in the
[1:12:24] plane and they sure and that's exactly
[1:12:25] what the devil does in our lives amen
[1:12:27] he comes and and you know he he the
[1:12:30] lord's victorious
[1:12:31] amen he was victorious right before and
[1:12:33] then then
[1:12:34] he circles back around sometimes it'll
[1:12:36] take him a month it'll take him it'll
[1:12:38] take him a year praise the name of the
[1:12:39] lord i know that
[1:12:40] the symptoms will probably come back
[1:12:42] again but praise the name of the lord
[1:12:43] i'm healed so it doesn't matter if those
[1:12:45] symptoms come back
[1:12:46] amen for each one of you it doesn't
[1:12:48] matter if something comes back if an
[1:12:49] ailment or if
[1:12:50] or if something happens in your life it
[1:12:52] doesn't matter if those things circle
[1:12:53] around
[1:12:54] because then then he tries to talk
[1:12:56] himself up the devil will say oh you
[1:12:57] know
[1:12:58] you know oh he's he's just the god of
[1:12:59] the he got the hills if we if we put him
[1:13:01] in our territory
[1:13:03] if you know if he brings it down to the
[1:13:04] valleys then oh we're going to be able
[1:13:05] to defeat the army
[1:13:06] and he said oh no and do this thing in
[1:13:09] verse 24 take the kings
[1:13:10] away every man out of his place and put
[1:13:12] the captains in their room
[1:13:15] and we shall fight against them we're
[1:13:16] going to move on
[1:13:18] um in verse 26.
[1:13:21] let's see fight against them in the
[1:13:23] plane in verse 26 it came to pass at the
[1:13:25] return of the year
[1:13:26] that benedict numbered the syrians and
[1:13:27] went out to effect to fight against
[1:13:29] israel
[1:13:29] and the israel were numbered so this is
[1:13:31] what i was talking about earlier how the
[1:13:32] israel israelites were numbered
[1:13:34] and they were all present and they went
[1:13:35] against them and the children of israel
[1:13:37] pitched them like two little flocks of
[1:13:38] kids
[1:13:39] but the syrians filled the filled the
[1:13:41] country so you know the king james
[1:13:43] version
[1:13:43] i haven't i wasn't able to ponder on any
[1:13:45] other versions but the king james
[1:13:47] version says that they
[1:13:48] in in comparison to the syrian army
[1:13:52] which
[1:13:52] filled the country okay you have the
[1:13:54] israelite army
[1:13:55] that looked like two little flocks of
[1:13:57] kids okay amen
[1:13:59] so and the children of israel were
[1:14:01] numbered and there came a man of god
[1:14:03] that spake unto israel and said
[1:14:04] thus saith the lord because the syrians
[1:14:08] have said
[1:14:09] the lord is god of the hills but he is
[1:14:11] not god of the valleys
[1:14:12] therefore i will deliver out all this
[1:14:14] great multitude into thine hand and ye
[1:14:16] shall know that i in the lord blessed be
[1:14:18] the name of the lord ye shall know that
[1:14:20] i am the lord amen
[1:14:21] that's what it says in verse 13 it says
[1:14:24] it twice now he says i will deliver thee
[1:14:26] into thine hand and thou
[1:14:27] shalt know that i am the lord the lord
[1:14:28] will have his glory it says every knee
[1:14:30] will bow and every tongue will come
[1:14:32] flesh
[1:14:32] well i was i know that i've confessed
[1:14:34] with my tongue and i've bowed my knee
[1:14:36] already amen
[1:14:37] but some will some will some will need
[1:14:39] to bow amen and it said they pitched
[1:14:41] over and there was
[1:14:42] he says that there ye shall know that i
[1:14:44] am the lord and they pitched over
[1:14:45] against
[1:14:45] verse 29 and they pitched over against
[1:14:48] the other seven days
[1:14:49] and it was so in the seventh day of
[1:14:51] battle was joined and the children
[1:14:54] the children of israel slew of the
[1:14:56] syrians a hundred thousand foot men in
[1:14:59] one
[1:15:00] day amen i feel like i
[1:15:03] i feel like i was going around today as
[1:15:05] just
[1:15:06] slaying syrians i'm not i'm serious amen
[1:15:09] i was so excited i got
[1:15:11] i got i got that scripture and it just
[1:15:13] was in my heart and i was so excited
[1:15:15] about it i was jumping for joy
[1:15:16] and i was saying lord lord if if it's
[1:15:18] what you're supposed to do in my life
[1:15:19] then
[1:15:20] then then have your way and if this
[1:15:22] ailment is supposed to go away then
[1:15:24] it is supposed to go away because 2000
[1:15:26] years ago he died on a cross
[1:15:27] so that we could be saved and we could
[1:15:29] be healed amen so that's what he did
[1:15:31] and they slew 100 000 footmen we're
[1:15:34] slaying sometimes
[1:15:35] friends it feels like you know a pastor
[1:15:38] or
[1:15:38] or the or you know a minister or even
[1:15:41] even you know a man of god is
[1:15:42] is standing in one corner just like an
[1:15:44] mma fight he's standing in one corner
[1:15:45] just fighting
[1:15:46] and then you have you know the devil
[1:15:47] standing in the other corner and i'm
[1:15:49] just i'm like i'm like in the corner man
[1:15:50] and i'm like
[1:15:51] go lord go lord amen does anybody else
[1:15:53] ever feel like that you just want to oh
[1:15:55] you just want to be oh lord you just
[1:15:56] want to jump for joy because you know
[1:15:58] that he's going to he's going to
[1:16:01] revelation it says
[1:16:02] that we will overcome
[1:16:05] amen we will overcome by the blood of
[1:16:08] the lamb
[1:16:09] and by what by the word of our testimony
[1:16:11] so guess what it was today it was a
[1:16:13] testimony
[1:16:14] that i was healed it's a testimony that
[1:16:16] they
[1:16:17] oh amen all right let's let's move on
[1:16:18] amen um
[1:16:20] children of israel flew uh of a slew of
[1:16:22] the syrians a hundred thousand footmen
[1:16:24] in one day
[1:16:25] but the rest fled to effect into the
[1:16:28] city and there a wall fell upon twenty
[1:16:30] and seven
[1:16:31] thousand men so uh so i was just
[1:16:32] picturing and i was going back earlier
[1:16:34] but i was picturing this
[1:16:35] so like what happened again is these
[1:16:37] syrians
[1:16:38] you know they fled a whole hundred
[1:16:40] thousand of their buddies just died so
[1:16:41] 27 000 of them fled and i would imagine
[1:16:44] that they're in some kind of trench it
[1:16:45] says that the wall fell on him
[1:16:46] so they were hiding i'm guessing they
[1:16:48] were hiding like like what the devil
[1:16:49] does he was hiding sometimes he cowers
[1:16:51] away
[1:16:52] and he hides right amen so they were
[1:16:54] hiding but guess what the lord still
[1:16:56] slew him
[1:16:57] amen they didn't get away the lord was
[1:17:00] victorious and they shall know that i am
[1:17:02] the lord and his servant said unto him
[1:17:04] for
[1:17:04] behold now we have heard that the king
[1:17:06] of the house of israel are merciful
[1:17:07] kings
[1:17:08] and i pray that he put sackcloth on our
[1:17:10] up on our loins and god and the kings of
[1:17:12] israel so amen
[1:17:13] so we we have these we have these two
[1:17:15] victories amen
[1:17:16] in our that happen in this in this
[1:17:18] chapter and i wanted
[1:17:20] and i wanted to just take you know you
[1:17:22] know the huge the big army versus the
[1:17:24] little army and i wanted to attribute it
[1:17:25] to our lives
[1:17:26] and and show that you know that the lord
[1:17:30] he has a way of overcoming amen and
[1:17:35] whether or not whether or not you know
[1:17:38] it takes a month or a year
[1:17:42] and it may not be a physical ailment
[1:17:43] amen it may be you know a spiritual
[1:17:46] something that you're struggling with
[1:17:47] spiritually amen or it may be something
[1:17:49] that you're struggling with
[1:17:50] you know that that nobody else knows
[1:17:51] about only the lord knows about

[1:17:58] fighting with it for a week a month a
[1:18:00] year
[1:18:00] two years two more than two years in my
[1:18:02] case you could be fighting with it for
[1:18:04] however long
[1:18:05] but the lord i had to put those
[1:18:07] scriptures together
[1:18:08] and what i had what i had to realize is
[1:18:11] that the name of the lord
[1:18:13] will be heard and the name of the lord
[1:18:17] you shall know that i am the lord amen
[1:18:20] amen
[1:18:24] amen praise the name of the lord i'm so
[1:18:28] excited to be up here friends
[1:18:29] i'm so excited that the lord put this
[1:18:31] upon my heart
[1:18:33] i'm so excited to be lord i'm so excited
[1:18:35] to be a christian
[1:18:37] it's so it's such an exciting time that
[1:18:39] we live in to be christians friends
[1:18:41] we are in the last days i was just
[1:18:43] sitting i was just sitting in my office
[1:18:45] and you know
[1:18:46] i have you know a picture of brother
[1:18:47] branham up here and then i have a
[1:18:48] picture of the lord jesus christ over
[1:18:49] here
[1:18:50] and i was just i was just i was just
[1:18:52] bowing down and i just was saying lord
[1:18:54] lord help me break through that barrier
[1:18:56] sometimes we get we get in a funk and i
[1:18:58] was
[1:18:58] you know we were talking about it in in
[1:19:00] that chatter we sometimes we get in
[1:19:02] these
[1:19:02] in this funk where you know we accept
[1:19:05] the things
[1:19:06] that the devil is putting our way or
[1:19:07] sometimes the the lord has allowed
[1:19:10] in our lives we i've accepted i was
[1:19:12] accepting for so long i was accepting
[1:19:14] that ailment i was so long i was just
[1:19:16] oh i was just trying i was trying by my
[1:19:17] own fruition by my own
[1:19:19] my own strength i was trying to do what
[1:19:21] i could do to to to to try to be healed
[1:19:24] or try to
[1:19:25] try to have some relief i was just what
[1:19:27] was i doing wrong
[1:19:28] i wasn't following the leadership of the
[1:19:29] lord i wasn't putting it completely in
[1:19:31] his hands
[1:19:32] he shall know that i am the lord i found
[1:19:34] out ye shall know that i am the lord
[1:19:37] i found out that that and i knew this
[1:19:39] all along but the lord had to really
[1:19:40] reveal it to me and sometimes friends it
[1:19:42] takes that time
[1:19:43] so that he can he can deal with your
[1:19:45] heart and he can reveal it to you
[1:19:47] in a special way that whatever it is
[1:19:49] that you're that you're struggling with

[1:20:02] what you can do
[1:20:04] it's not what what we do is as humans
[1:20:06] it's what the lord will do
[1:20:08] in our lives to to to heal us or or to
[1:20:11] deliver us

[1:20:13] israelite army because guess what

[1:23:31] lord if this is what you have for in
[1:23:32] store for me amen that i accepted and i
[1:23:34] believe it and i just

[1:23:40] that they're struggling with right that
[1:23:42] may be a physical ailment amen or
[1:23:44] or or maybe a maybe a spiritual ailment
[1:23:47] or you just want to draw closer to the
[1:23:48] lord amen
[1:23:49] amen just let's just stand up amen
[1:24:11] brother jason talked about this a little
[1:24:13] bit and
[1:24:14] this is something i'm just super
[1:24:16] familiar with because it's it's
[1:24:17] now it's what i do uh for work you know
[1:24:20] i'm a fireman
[1:24:21] and you know there's there's something
[1:24:23] that starts
[1:24:24] a fire there's three things that have
[1:24:26] that you have a fire you know there's
[1:24:27] there's fuel
[1:24:28] then there's oxygen and there's heat and
[1:24:29] if you take one thing away from that
[1:24:31] then the fire stops burning hey man it
[1:24:34] just completely stops you you take the
[1:24:36] oxygen away
[1:24:36] it'll burn out if you have oxygen and
[1:24:39] fuel and there's no heat
[1:24:40] it won't burn hey man if there's no fuel
[1:24:42] i'm in
[1:24:44] it won't burn sometimes i feel like
[1:24:48] the lord allows things in our lives
[1:24:51] these ailments or these spiritual
[1:24:53] struggles to happen in our lives in my
[1:24:54] life
[1:24:55] especially whatever you're going through
[1:24:57] he allows these things
[1:24:59] so that we can maybe take away
[1:25:02] maybe one thing is missing in our
[1:25:04] triangle of fire amen
[1:25:06] maybe maybe maybe some heat is missing
[1:25:08] maybe maybe
[1:25:09] some fuel is missing maybe we're not
[1:25:11] feeling ourselves with the word
[1:25:12] or feeling ourselves with a message we
[1:25:15] have breath in our lungs
[1:25:16] and you know we have we have this word
[1:25:19] we have this message and sometimes
[1:25:22] the lord will allow those things and i
[1:25:24] think i believe it with all my heart
[1:25:25] that he allowed me to go through that
[1:25:26] ailment for so long
[1:25:28] so that i could i could understand his
[1:25:30] word and understand it
[1:25:32] that it doesn't matter what i do it
[1:25:34] doesn't matter what i say it doesn't
[1:25:35] matter
[1:25:36] anything nothing matters except the lord
[1:25:39] and his glory amen
[1:25:40] not it doesn't matter and and it's like
[1:25:42] it's like the heat was missing
[1:25:44] in my fire and he just started again and
[1:25:48] i just want to praise the name of the
[1:25:49] lord

[1:28:42] the name of the lord bless it be the
[1:28:47] name of the lord
[1:29:00] bless it be the name of the lord
[1:29:10] bless it be the name of the lord
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:22] hallelujah
[1:29:26] they shall know that i am the lord
[1:29:31] don't you want him to do that in your
[1:29:32] life i want the
[1:29:34] enemy to know who my lord is
[1:29:38] they shall know i tell you you know i've
[1:29:40] always loved
[1:29:42] part of that story where they tried to
[1:29:45] say well you know he's just a god of the
[1:29:47] mountains and
[1:29:48] you know we'll whoop him down in the
[1:29:50] plains we'll put a we'll whoop him
[1:29:52] because he's not a god of the plains and
[1:29:54] and the lord decided to just wipe them
[1:29:57] out just because they said that
[1:30:00] so you need to be careful what you say
[1:30:02] because somebody's listening
[1:30:03] amen praise the lord i was thinking to
[1:30:06] myself that if god was going to do that
[1:30:08] if he was going to make sure if he was
[1:30:11] going to make sure
[1:30:13] that the enemy knew he was the lord
[1:30:17] if he was going to do that then i'd
[1:30:18] imagine
[1:30:20] that bringing an army up against you
[1:30:24] that made your army look like two little
[1:30:26] flocks of kids
[1:30:27] and their army filled the whole the
[1:30:30] whole landscape
[1:30:32] i think that'd be a pretty good way to
[1:30:33] do it i think the lord would say you
[1:30:35] know i'm gonna really make this
[1:30:37] stick and i'm just gonna give you an
[1:30:40] army
[1:30:40] just look like two little flocks of kids
[1:30:43] and
[1:30:44] and i'm gonna fill i'm gonna fill the
[1:30:46] whole countryside
[1:30:47] with their army i think that would be a
[1:30:50] great way to do it
[1:30:52] brother caleb was telling me today all
[1:30:54] right he was in the back office and he
[1:30:55] said
[1:30:56] man he said after after i left today and
[1:30:59] he said i got in my car and he said i
[1:31:00] started crying
[1:31:02] he said then i started preaching he said
[1:31:04] i cried for half an hour i preached for
[1:31:05] an hour
[1:31:06] and he said then i got to walmart he
[1:31:08] said i got out in the parking lot he
[1:31:09] said i walked around the parking lot
[1:31:10] preaching for another half an hour
[1:31:13] i think i think the enemy has figured
[1:31:15] out who
[1:31:16] the lord is amen i i had this quote sent
[1:31:21] to me
[1:31:22] by my daughter-in-law it was so good i
[1:31:24] thought i wanted to read it brother
[1:31:25] caleb this will be good
[1:31:26] listen to this this is from possessing
[1:31:29] all
[1:31:30] things one of the most powerful ways
[1:31:32] that i've ever heard brother branham
[1:31:34] talk about spiritual warfare
[1:31:35] how many got spiritual warfares and you
[1:31:37] need the devil beat down by the lord
[1:31:39] i mean it doesn't matter what your need
[1:31:41] is the lord is here to do that brother
[1:31:44] branham says the promise
[1:31:46] is yours already
[1:31:49] the promise is yours now watch but
[1:31:52] if you ever get it you ain't gonna get
[1:31:55] it easy
[1:31:58] i'm going to tell you that you're going
[1:32:00] to have to take it away from
[1:32:02] satan satan captures your health
[1:32:05] you got a right to go to satan say
[1:32:09] give it back hand it over
[1:32:12] amen oh my goodness i
[1:32:15] come in the name of the lord the
[1:32:17] possessor of heaven and earth
[1:32:20] and i'm his heir i thought about
[1:32:23] you know brother caleb kept pointing out
[1:32:26] i mean listen
[1:32:27] when you think about ahab and you think
[1:32:29] about israel
[1:32:30] there was plenty of unworthiness to go
[1:32:32] around
[1:32:34] more than enough unworthiness to go
[1:32:36] around a lot of times it's that way in
[1:32:38] our lives hitting friends
[1:32:39] more than enough worthiness to go around
[1:32:41] but the bottom line was this was god's
[1:32:43] chosen people
[1:32:45] and he wasn't going to lose them brother
[1:32:47] branham says
[1:32:49] i'm his heir give it back you took my
[1:32:53] child you got her mixed up with the
[1:32:55] wrong boy you took my boy got him mixed
[1:32:57] up with the wrong girl
[1:32:59] i claim them that's right
[1:33:02] i claim my children i claim my brother i
[1:33:06] claim my sister yes
[1:33:08] satan you've took them from god's house
[1:33:11] coaxed him out there
[1:33:12] but i'm coming after them i claim them
[1:33:15] amen and that powerful
[1:33:18] i am an heir of all things do you have
[1:33:21] enough
[1:33:22] courage i tell you if you arrived here
[1:33:24] with not enough courage say that you
[1:33:25] should have enough courage now
[1:33:26] after hearing that sermon you say i am
[1:33:30] an heir of all things
[1:33:33] it's given to me i'm an heir i can claim
[1:33:37] everything that god promised me
[1:33:41] amen there you are it's mine how do you
[1:33:43] get it
[1:33:44] something you've done no sir it's the
[1:33:47] unmerited gift that god gave us
[1:33:50] and it's ours it belongs to us

[1:36:35] this would be the name of the lord
[1:36:39] i so thoroughly enjoyed that
[1:36:43] tonight i i i don't want to embarrass
[1:36:47] him but
[1:36:48] you know we we started a kind of a bible
[1:36:52] reading club and a whole bunch of you
[1:36:53] have joined up and were
[1:36:55] you actually some people say what
[1:36:58] brothers and what's up with all that
[1:36:59] because i was telling the young people
[1:37:02] in our last meeting
[1:37:04] that did you know and i don't bet you
[1:37:07] didn't know this
[1:37:08] because even i didn't know it at all i
[1:37:10] was shocked i heard billy graham say it
[1:37:12] and he was talking to larry king about
[1:37:14] reading the whole bible and larry was
[1:37:16] like well wow you know
[1:37:17] he said read the new testament well
[1:37:19] that's still a lot he said
[1:37:20] listen he said there are fewer
[1:37:24] words in the entire new testament
[1:37:28] than in the average edition
[1:37:31] the average sunday edition of the new
[1:37:34] york times
[1:37:36] there are fewer words in the entire new
[1:37:40] testament
[1:37:41] from matthew to revelation there are
[1:37:43] fewer words in the entire new testament
[1:37:46] than that appear in the average sunday
[1:37:48] edition of the new york times
[1:37:50] and there are some people who as a
[1:37:52] matter of course go on sunday
[1:37:54] buy the sunday edition and they'll take
[1:37:56] all week and read in it every day
[1:37:58] and by that week they'll have read the
[1:37:59] whole thing and they get the next sunday
[1:38:00] edition and
[1:38:02] do you realize we started doing young
[1:38:04] people now we start doing some counting
[1:38:05] up
[1:38:06] and do you do you realize you can you
[1:38:08] can actually
[1:38:10] read uh the entire new testament
[1:38:15] even uh even an average reader could
[1:38:18] read the entire new testament in
[1:38:19] under 16 hours and if you just read
[1:38:23] an hour in the morning and an hour in
[1:38:25] the evening
[1:38:26] and you just did that you'd you'd
[1:38:28] literally read your entire testament
[1:38:30] in in about seven or eight days and
[1:38:33] people say i'm going to read the i'm
[1:38:34] going to read it in a year
[1:38:35] you could read it 50 times you could
[1:38:38] read that literally read the new
[1:38:39] testament and when i said that the young
[1:38:41] people
[1:38:41] and and it caught in some of them and
[1:38:44] and we got an app and everybody got the
[1:38:45] same app and we're reading it along as
[1:38:47] we go
[1:38:48] and and i was reading the other day
[1:38:51] um i think in mark's gospel yeah
[1:38:55] and it was so beautiful because it might
[1:38:57] have been matthew mark
[1:38:58] and when the when mary and martha came
[1:39:02] into the tomb
[1:39:04] i'm not saying this to embarrass you
[1:39:05] brother when martha and mary came into
[1:39:08] the tomb
[1:39:09] and they walked in and the bible says
[1:39:13] there was an angel in there and it and
[1:39:16] they saw
[1:39:16] a young man and he was a young man
[1:39:21] sitting on the right side and he said
[1:39:23] you're looking for jesus
[1:39:25] he's not here go tell his disciples he's
[1:39:27] gone into galilee
[1:39:28] and i thought this wasn't some big
[1:39:31] gleaming
[1:39:32] winged creature this was just a young
[1:39:34] man and they saw a young man
[1:39:36] and he no doubt just smiled at him and i
[1:39:39] thought to myself
[1:39:40] man whenever i think of that with that
[1:39:42] angel as a young man i don't know why i
[1:39:44] think of caleb
[1:39:47] something about that smile just like
[1:39:49] that had to be i think what they saw was
[1:39:51] like caleb if i
[1:39:52] walked into the tomb and just saw caleb
[1:39:53] sitting there and said you're looking
[1:39:55] for jesus
[1:39:56] yeah he's not here
[1:39:59] amen i had a nice kick out of that but
[1:40:02] it was the truth i was telling you how
[1:40:03] it struck me
[1:40:04] but i tell you what i tell you what i
[1:40:06] think we saw tonight
[1:40:07] friends i think like in the days of
[1:40:11] daniel the spirit of god on daniel
[1:40:15] the characteristic of that spirit of god
[1:40:17] is that he's a dissolver
[1:40:19] of all doubts and i believe
[1:40:22] i think we saw tonight and we're all
[1:40:24] witnesses the holy spirit is a dissolver
[1:40:27] of all doubts
[1:40:28] how many believe you heard from god
[1:40:30] tonight how many feel
[1:40:31] fed on the word of god i feel thrilled
[1:40:34] with what i heard
[1:40:36] amen i don't have uh i got
[1:40:39] a couple of prayer requests that came in
[1:40:41] sister deborah
[1:40:42] is having a difficulty in her hand she's
[1:40:45] got a pain in her hand
[1:40:46] not sure if it's inflammation or
[1:40:48] something and um
[1:40:50] she's talking to me about it today and i
[1:40:52] said uh
[1:40:53] hey maybe maybe see if with andrew can
[1:40:55] maybe show up some extra services and he
[1:40:57] wasn't supposed to be here tonight and
[1:40:58] then lo and behold he walks in the door
[1:41:00] and so she said oh i get to take have
