[46:15] for us in jesus name amen if you have
[46:18] your bibles tonight we're going to look
[46:19] here in luke 1
[46:21] verse 26.
[46:26] luke 1 and verse 26 four weeks ago to
[46:30] this day i preached a message back home
[46:31] on god does
[46:32] impossible math and when we think about
[46:35] math we think about
[46:36] problems we think about equations we
[46:38] think about you know for some of us
[46:40] very difficult computations to try to
[46:42] get to the answer
[46:44] but god does impossible math he loves to
[46:47] deal with
[46:48] impossible situations impossible
[46:51] problems
[46:51] because there's never been a problem
[46:53] that god didn't have but the answer
[46:55] and i believe tonight he's still god and
[46:57] what i want to speak to you tonight just
[46:59] for a little bit
[47:00] i'm not sure how long you have service
[47:02] but we're here so let's just have church
[47:03] tonight
[47:04] but i want to speak to you god wants you
[47:07] to believe
[47:08] for the impossible god wants you to
[47:11] believe for the impossible
[47:12] whatever you're facing whatever
[47:14] situation you're going through
[47:16] god wants you to believe that he has the
[47:18] answer and not only does he have the
[47:20] answer
[47:20] but you can have the answer tonight
[47:23] because he is god
[47:24] and the prophet of god said god is god
[47:27] and that's all we need tonight
[47:29] just as you mentioned the other sunday
[47:31] he's still christ everything we are is
[47:33] christ
[47:34] whether we go to walmart it's christ i'm
[47:36] going to tell you he's god of the bible
[47:37] or he ain't got it all
[47:39] he's got tonight or he ain't got it all
[47:41] but i'm here to tell you and proclaim to
[47:43] you
[47:43] he's still god god is god and god is
[47:46] ready to have church and i trust you are
[47:49] luke 1 verse 26 and in the sixth month
[47:52] if you can get just a little bit of the
[47:53] treble out of this that'll be great
[47:55] or add me some bass because it's
[47:57] piercing my ear in the sixth month
[47:59] the angel graber was sent from god into
[48:02] a city of galilee named nazareth
[48:04] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[48:06] was joseph
[48:08] of the house of david and the virgin's
[48:10] name was mary
[48:12] and the angel came into her and he said
[48:15] hell thou art highly favored the lord is
[48:18] with thee blessed art thou among women
[48:20] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[48:22] his saying
[48:24] and she cast in her mind what manner of
[48:26] salutation
[48:28] this should be and the angel said unto
[48:30] her fear not mary
[48:31] for thou hast found favor with god
[48:35] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[48:38] womb and bring forth a son
[48:39] and thou shall call his name jesus and
[48:41] he shall be great and he shall be called
[48:43] the son of the highest
[48:45] and the lord god shall give unto him the
[48:47] throne of his father david
[48:48] and he shall reign over the house of
[48:50] jacob forever
[48:52] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[48:55] then said mary unto the angel
[48:56] how shall this be seeing i know not a
[48:59] man
[49:00] and the angel answered and said unto her
[49:02] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[49:05] and the power of the high shall
[49:06] overshadow thee therefore also that the
[49:09] holy thing
[49:10] we shall be born of thee shall be called
[49:12] the son of god
[49:13] and verse 37 for with god nothing
[49:16] shall be impossible and notice mary's
[49:20] reply
[49:22] behold the handmaid of the lord be it
[49:24] unto me according to thy word
[49:27] and the angel departed from her you can
[49:29] have your seats tonight
[49:44] so we find here tonight the word
[49:48] impossible means not possible now isn't
[49:51] that profound
[49:53] that's very profound webster put that in
[49:55] there impossible means not
[49:58] possible unable to be or to exist
[50:01] unable to be done unable to be performed
[50:04] unable to be true utterly impractical
[50:09] hopelessly unsuitable so we find here
[50:12] that it's impossible no possibility
[50:16] 100 not able to be done
[50:19] and many times that's the situations
[50:21] that we face
[50:23] in our life it may be with health it may
[50:25] be with some situation some torment in
[50:27] spirit
[50:28] or it may be with finance or whatever it
[50:29] may be many if at some point through our
[50:32] christian journey
[50:33] has faced or is facing or will face
[50:36] an impossible situation but i want you
[50:39] to know
[50:39] like god wants you to believe for the
[50:42] impossible
[50:44] god doesn't want that to hinder your
[50:45] faith god doesn't want that
[50:47] to stop you from moving forward and we
[50:49] find how many you've ever laid up at
[50:51] night
[50:53] sweating tossing and turning wringing
[50:56] your hands
[50:57] because you got a situation and you
[50:59] don't have the answer
[51:01] you don't have the clue how you're going
[51:03] to get through this how is god going to
[51:05] make a way for you
[51:06] but look many times that's when you got
[51:08] to take your eyes off of your problem
[51:10] take your eyes off of the situation and
[51:12] put your eyes
[51:13] back on god back on the word of god
[51:17] and when you take your eyes off of you
[51:19] take your eyes and put them back on god
[51:21] then all
[51:22] things are possible now in louisiana all
[51:26] means everything
[51:28] not sure what it means here in south
[51:29] carolina but i'm assuming it means the
[51:31] same
[51:32] and for a believer it means no matter
[51:34] what i face it matters no matter
[51:36] what devil i face what situation i face
[51:38] one problem i face
[51:40] all things are possible for them that
[51:42] believe tonight
[51:46] so we're going to take this story of
[51:47] mary
[51:49] we're going to drop in here we're going
[51:50] to dramatize i love how the prophet of
[51:51] god will
[51:52] just kind of drop in and tell a story as
[51:55] if he just
[51:56] was back there and he watched it play
[51:57] out and he said in the spring sun was
[52:00] rising high and
[52:01] the judean seas are in the skies and it
[52:03] started up the street
[52:05] mary started up the street going to get
[52:06] her water that morning
[52:08] her little youthful mind was thinking
[52:10] about the day before when she was in
[52:11] church and
[52:12] hearing the rabbi speak and oh how he
[52:15] was telling them how god had done great
[52:16] things and
[52:17] miraculous things hey talked about how
[52:20] they brought them through the red sea we
[52:21] know when they were trapped there and
[52:23] you know it seemed to be an impossible
[52:25] situation brother jason but
[52:26] that didn't stop god god put a highway
[52:29] right through the red sea
[52:30] and he began to tell him about how david
[52:32] when david faced goliath there he was a
[52:35] little bitty young man
[52:36] but he didn't let the goliath's boats
[52:38] put any fear inside of
[52:40] it looked to be an impossible situation
[52:42] but david had been anointed to be
[52:44] king in the impossible situation was
[52:46] made a reality
[52:47] because david took god and his word
[52:50] oh he you know he would tell him about
[52:52] daniel and the lion's den
[52:54] in the hebrew children how they faced a
[52:56] fiery furnace
[52:58] all impossible situations
[53:01] he was lifting their faith up for the
[53:04] prophet god was saved but by the end of
[53:05] the message he ruined what he had been
[53:07] talking about
[53:08] when he said those great days of jehovah
[53:10] dealing with the people like that
[53:12] it wasn't necessary no more
[53:16] those great days of jehovah moving
[53:18] through the red sea and the prophet of
[53:20] god would say
[53:20] god look down through angry eyes any
[53:23] part of the red sea i say god come
[53:25] tonight
[53:25] and look through angry eyes and look at
[53:27] the situation it may be nervousness
[53:29] it may be high blood pressure it may be
[53:31] depressing god look down tonight and
[53:34] apart the red sea for us and we can walk
[53:36] on through to dry ground
[53:40] but he said he ruined it because he said
[53:42] that to jehovah of the old
[53:45] he doesn't deal with the people like
[53:47] that anymore
[53:49] god doesn't do those things anymore
[53:53] it's not necessary we don't need god to
[53:55] do that
[53:57] see they become brother brother men will
[53:58] say they have to come settle down
[54:00] in their homeland and they didn't
[54:02] exactly need miracles no more
[54:06] oh i don't know if you've heard some of
[54:08] the trends sweeping through the message
[54:09] ranks
[54:11] well the days of miracles are passed
[54:14] that was only for the 50s and 60s
[54:17] that was only for a prophet ministry oh
[54:20] don't you put the god don't put god in
[54:22] the past church
[54:24] if he's not god today he wasn't god then
[54:26] but i'm going to tell you as much as god
[54:28] as he was in the 50s
[54:29] and 60s in the supernatural he's still
[54:32] god for you tonight
[54:34] whatever your situation whatever the
[54:35] circumstance you're going through
[54:37] he's still god don't you let somebody
[54:39] proclaim we don't need the god of
[54:41] wonders
[54:42] we don't need the god of miraculous we
[54:44] don't need the god of supernatural
[54:45] yes we need him tonight i need him
[54:47] tonight you need him tonight
[54:49] he needs to show up in this service
[54:50] tonight
[54:53] do you welcome that god tonight
[54:56] do you welcome into your pew it's one
[54:57] thing to welcome into the church
[54:59] but do you welcome into your pew do you
[55:01] welcome into your situation
[55:03] do you welcome into your private life
[55:05] god i'm dealing with this i need you to
[55:07] move tonight
[55:08] i need to see the god of the
[55:09] supernatural
[55:14] brother god would go on to say they had
[55:16] good doctors for their sickness
[55:18] which is certainly all right they had
[55:21] better they were better off they had
[55:23] they had their homes but they didn't
[55:24] need god in the god of miracles anymore
[55:27] and somehow that didn't settle that
[55:29] didn't satisf
[55:31] excuse me satisfy the thirst and hunger
[55:33] of joseph and mary
[55:34] and i trust it doesn't satisfy the
[55:36] thirst of bethel tabernacle tonight
[55:40] oh i can't listen to that i can't hear
[55:41] that something that just doesn't sit
[55:43] well with me
[55:44] when they say we don't need that kind of
[55:45] god anymore
[55:47] because they don't want to be associated
[55:49] with holy roller worship
[55:52] you know you can look at me and you may
[55:54] think well he come out of a pentecostal
[55:56] church
[55:58] no not so i came off the streets 22
[56:02] years ago come off the streets came in
[56:04] and began to serve god god began to deal
[56:06] with me in a baptist church
[56:07] then i went to this church and i went to
[56:09] that church and finally i came into the
[56:11] truth
[56:12] let me tell you i ain't never been the
[56:13] same since you can label me what you
[56:16] want but he's already called me a son of
[56:18] god
[56:18] and what the spirit of the lord is there
[56:20] is liberty there is freedom to worship
[56:22] that's the sing the great songs of
[56:25] jehovah god
[56:26] moving in the red seas moving upon the
[56:28] people and i believe he's just as much
[56:30] god tonight
[56:34] so mary's walking down the road now and
[56:37] she's thinking about yesterday's service
[56:40] man this just didn't settle well with me
[56:42] how can it be that he done all these
[56:44] things
[56:46] and we hear about the god of our
[56:47] grandfather
[56:49] the god of our fathers and the god of
[56:51] our grandfather why isn't he god today
[56:55] we've heard about the god of brother
[56:57] branham and that generation and how
[56:59] that generation passed on and you can go
[57:01] to some churches
[57:02] and they still there's some of them
[57:04] there that that remember those days in
[57:06] the 60s
[57:07] late 60s and they were part of the the
[57:09] the services of brother branham that he
[57:11] had they've witnessed the supernatural
[57:16] why can't we see that same kind of
[57:18] movement today
[57:21] why can't we expect god to do the same
[57:23] today is it because the man's off the
[57:25] scene
[57:26] so does our entire experience rest on a
[57:29] man
[57:30] or does it rest on god oh does it rest
[57:33] because if it rests on a man then what
[57:35] happened in the first age
[57:36] when paul left the scene and iranians
[57:39] left the scene
[57:40] and luther left the scene and colombo
[57:42] left the scene
[57:43] what happens church god doesn't cease to
[57:45] be god he's still
[57:46] god tonight and he's still wanting his
[57:49] people to believe in the impossibilities
[57:54] oh hallelujah so she's walking down the
[57:57] street thinking on these things and she
[57:58] sees
[57:59] a little glimmer of light you know look
[58:02] kind of like us we could just kind of
[58:03] rub our eyes you know early morning
[58:05] maybe a little bit to do or something in
[58:07] our eyes
[58:08] and she begins to think now she remember
[58:10] reading in isaiah 9
[58:12] and verse 6 unto us a child is born unto
[58:15] us a son
[58:17] is given wonder what that means brother
[58:19] matthew
[58:20] a child is born a son is given has this
[58:23] come to pass yet
[58:26] so she's thinking on these things and i
[58:28] love how the way the prophet of god was
[58:30] saying it
[58:32] now she's stinging on these things she
[58:33] raises her head again
[58:35] and there stands a great light and one
[58:37] walks out of that light the angel
[58:38] gabriel
[58:39] walks out of that light says hell mary
[58:42] thou are
[58:42] highly favored paul church it wasn't a
[58:46] mistake that
[58:47] he walked out of that light let me tell
[58:49] you it wasn't a mistake that you and i
[58:51] have seen that same pillar of fire move
[58:53] in this generation
[58:54] and he's saying hell brad you're highly
[58:57] favored among women
[58:58] oh you're chosen among millions you've
[59:01] been elected among millions you're know
[59:03] predestinated
[59:04] among millions i could have went to this
[59:06] one and that one 712 years
[59:08] he laid in the word but finally that
[59:11] preached all hallelujah
[59:12] that predestinated seed came on the
[59:14] scene and god anointed that seed with
[59:17] life
[59:17] and he's here tonight to anoint that
[59:19] seed that same predestinated sea
[59:22] with the eternal life of the word of god
[59:27] he's here notice now
[59:32] so it came to a virgin 15
[59:35] 16 years old never known a man inspired
[59:38] or a spouse to joseph to be married
[59:42] and the brother branham would say it
[59:43] like this
[59:45] he would say in the in the message
[59:46] mary's belief
[59:48] he said he gave her something to believe
[59:52] that was more outstanding outstanding
[59:55] and hard to believe than anything he
[59:58] ever give anyone
[1:00:01] if you think about daniel facing the
[1:00:02] lines harder than that
[1:00:05] three hebrew boys facing the fiery
[1:00:07] furnace harder than that
[1:00:09] the hebrew children mountains on every
[1:00:11] side the red sea in front of them
[1:00:13] and pharaoh's army coming up from behind
[1:00:15] them with vengeance declaring that
[1:00:17] they're going to destroy them
[1:00:18] and yet he gave her something to believe
[1:00:21] that was much harder than that
[1:00:25] and what was her reply church what was
[1:00:29] her reply church
[1:00:30] be it unto me tonight oh god it may seem
[1:00:34] impossible
[1:00:35] i don't know how you're going to do it
[1:00:36] god but i know it land over there in
[1:00:38] isaiah 9
[1:00:39] there's going to be a child born there's
[1:00:41] going to be a son given lord if it's to
[1:00:43] me tonight
[1:00:44] god be it unto me tonight unto thy word
[1:00:46] let it be stunned
[1:00:51] six months prior to that the same angel
[1:00:54] went to zacharias
[1:00:55] and he was a minister in the tear in the
[1:00:57] temple again
[1:00:58] he was told that he and his wife were
[1:00:59] going to bear a child in their old age
[1:01:01] and he said how can this be i'm old and
[1:01:04] my wife is old now you shouldn't be
[1:01:05] picking on your wife zacharias
[1:01:07] one thing you never do is talk about how
[1:01:09] old your wife is
[1:01:11] i got a young beautiful wife she's not
[1:01:14] in here to hear it right now but
[1:01:16] young and beautiful but we find here
[1:01:19] that he doubted the word how could this
[1:01:23] be i'm old i got problems
[1:01:26] god's a master of problems
[1:01:29] and here this little woman had to
[1:01:30] believe something that had never
[1:01:33] happened before having a baby
[1:01:36] without knowing a man how can these
[1:01:39] things be
[1:01:41] because the holy ghost is going to
[1:01:42] overshadow you
[1:01:44] oh if that same holy ghost that
[1:01:46] overshadowed her then
[1:01:47] can come by here tonight and overshadow
[1:01:50] some of you
[1:01:51] oh you don't have to walk out the same
[1:01:52] that you walked in you don't have to go
[1:01:54] out packing that same anxiety and that
[1:01:56] same fear
[1:01:57] and that same depression and that same
[1:01:59] nervous spirit you can walk out of here
[1:02:01] with your held
[1:02:02] high because why because you met the god
[1:02:04] of impossibility
[1:02:06] and he moved on your situation tonight
[1:02:12] notice now the prophet of god will say
[1:02:14] like this she didn't question that
[1:02:16] but hold the handmaid of the lord be it
[1:02:18] unto me according to thy word
[1:02:21] and he said if we could just do that
[1:02:26] if we could just do that that's the only
[1:02:30] thing
[1:02:30] that's what god loves that's the only
[1:02:33] way to get right with god
[1:02:34] is to take him at your his word excuse
[1:02:37] me
[1:02:38] that's the only way that there is to
[1:02:39] please god is to take him
[1:02:41] at his word don't trust in your
[1:02:43] knowledge your reason
[1:02:45] how can it be done it cannot be done he
[1:02:47] goes when you reason then you lose the
[1:02:49] victory
[1:02:51] when you reason then you lose the
[1:02:54] victory
[1:02:56] so we're to cast down reasonings
[1:02:58] imaginations
[1:02:59] conscience affections all those things
[1:03:02] and see what mary did in the message
[1:03:04] mary's belief
[1:03:04] the prophet of god would say mary took
[1:03:06] him at his word
[1:03:08] and he changed her whole course of
[1:03:10] natural life for her

[1:06:32] it takes the word of the holy spirit and
[1:06:34] he's the one who made the promise
[1:06:36] and he's the one who confirms that
[1:06:38] promise he's obligated to keep
[1:06:40] that promise
[1:06:43] so it's not on who you went to to get
[1:06:46] prayer

[1:06:53] tonight god wants you to believe in the
[1:06:56] impossible
[1:06:58] notice now brother ben would go on to
[1:06:59] say mary didn't wait till she felt
[1:07:02] positive you know i know how some of us
[1:07:05] act because i sit where you sit
[1:07:08] sometimes
[1:07:09] and i don't know i don't sit back in the
[1:07:11] back excuse me i lied
[1:07:13] that's where you laugh a little bit it's
[1:07:15] okay
[1:07:18] but we find many times we don't want to
[1:07:21] give a testimony because
[1:07:23] you know it hasn't happened yet we don't
[1:07:26] have the 400
[1:07:27] results yet so i don't want to be a liar
[1:07:30] no you're not lying you're giving god
[1:07:32] praise
[1:07:34] because something's an anchor down in
[1:07:35] your heart you're not looking at the
[1:07:37] problem you're not looking at the
[1:07:39] situation
[1:07:40] you're looking at the word by his strife
[1:07:42] i'm already healed
[1:07:44] i'm going to declare and mary went
[1:07:45] around declaring before she felt
[1:07:47] anything
[1:07:48] she didn't look in the mirror and do
[1:07:50] that number and see the little baby bump
[1:07:51] no sir she went praising god i'm going
[1:07:54] to have a baby
[1:07:55] i'm going to have a baby i ain't never
[1:07:57] known a man before but god is going to
[1:07:59] fulfill
[1:07:59] isaiah 9 6 and it's coming through my
[1:08:02] woo and god is here tonight
[1:08:04] or to bring it through your womb if you
[1:08:06] can believe the word of god
[1:08:09] she didn't wait till she felt positive
[1:08:10] she didn't wait till she felt life
[1:08:12] or some physical sign that she was going
[1:08:14] to have a baby
[1:08:16] no sir she started rejoicing right then
[1:08:23] she started rejoicing right then mary
[1:08:26] said behold
[1:08:27] the handmaid of the lord oh she had a
[1:08:30] belief for something that had never
[1:08:32] happened before no woman had ever
[1:08:35] brought a child like that into the world
[1:08:37] by not knowing a man but see when you
[1:08:40] take god at his word
[1:08:42] you believe it anyhow no matter how
[1:08:44] impossible it looks to be
[1:08:46] believe god and he will bring it to pass

[1:19:14] for over three years
[1:19:16] yes the doctors proclaimed that there is
[1:19:18] no cure for this disease
[1:19:21] see that's what the doctors claim but
[1:19:24] i'm not listening to the doctor's report
[1:19:27] he said look how simple it came when i
[1:19:30] viewed the complex math problem
[1:19:32] on the wall behind you i knew it
[1:19:34] couldn't i couldn't touch it
[1:19:35] yet i knew i believed there was an
[1:19:37] answer to the problem
[1:19:39] it was then that i realized in my finite
[1:19:41] puny mind
[1:19:42] that and go and just because i didn't
[1:19:44] have or understand the answer
[1:19:46] to the problem did not mean that there
[1:19:48] wasn't one that one didn't exist
[1:19:50] how great is our god that he loves to
[1:19:52] take the most difficult problems
[1:19:54] and solve them he goes oh how that ought
[1:19:56] to increase our faith
[1:19:57] he's gonna share this with your
[1:19:59] congregation cause i'm ready to do a
[1:20:01] dance
[1:20:01] the revival it's revival time i say what
[1:20:04] about a bethel tabernacle
[1:20:06] if he's the same guy that can deliver
[1:20:08] from parkinson's four weeks ago
[1:20:09] he can deliver your situation tonight
[1:20:11] because he's still god
[1:20:13] he's still a god of the miraculous he's
[1:20:15] still a god of the supernatural
[1:20:18] and brother branham would say i believe
[1:20:20] if every patient in this building right
[1:20:21] now
[1:20:22] would accept it upon the grounds of
[1:20:23] god's word and believe it and start
[1:20:25] testifying and praising god for your
[1:20:27] healing
[1:20:27] this meeting wouldn't close with one
[1:20:29] crippled person in here
[1:20:31] i believe the same god's here tonight if
[1:20:33] you can just start confessing
[1:20:34] and start believing and start praising
[1:20:36] god and start thanking god for your
[1:20:38] your healing your deliverance whatever
[1:20:40] it may be you'll see
[1:20:41] the same god move
[1:20:50] it's okay to praise god
[1:20:54] our time sometimes we need a praise
[1:20:56] break in the house of god
[1:21:00] get too starchy oh we get two we get too
[1:21:02] aristocratic
[1:21:03] i don't want to move like that
[1:21:08] i understand look i'm not a fool i
[1:21:11] understand my gift don't bless some of
[1:21:12] you
[1:21:13] because i'm not a teacher and you like
[1:21:15] that that's fine because it's going to
[1:21:16] impact somebody
[1:21:18] and that teaching gift don't really
[1:21:20] bless me a whole lot because i like it
[1:21:21] fiery i like it hot i like it's coming
[1:21:24] i want the word but i like to teach in
[1:21:26] two but i don't get moved by it like i
[1:21:27] do
[1:21:28] with that evangelistic but see there's
[1:21:29] all sorts that's why god said i'll give
[1:21:31] you a five-fold ministry
[1:21:33] for the perfecting of the body now let
[1:21:35] me tell you if we could just have a
[1:21:36] praise breaking tonight and begin to
[1:21:38] praise god
[1:21:39] that he knows what i have need of
[1:21:40] whether it be hitting you tonight
[1:21:42] it may be your neighbor it may be your
[1:21:44] child it may be somebody that you know
[1:21:46] that's on the live stream stream tonight
[1:21:48] and yet god is dealing with them and you
[1:21:50] can pray the prayer of faith and say god
[1:21:52] send your anointing
[1:21:53] send your blessing send your holy ghost
[1:21:55] after night and touch that need
[1:21:57] deliver that situation
[1:22:03] god loves he loves
[1:22:07] to deal with the impossible case
[1:22:11] because when the doctor said they can't
[1:22:12] do no more
[1:22:14] the prophet of god say that's when
[1:22:15] you're trying to climb off the tree of
[1:22:17] knowledge
[1:22:18] you jump on over to the tree of life and
[1:22:21] keep on moving
[1:22:22] when they said i can't do it anymore all
[1:22:24] right i'm stepping off
[1:22:26] what are you doing you're stepping into
[1:22:28] faith tonight you're stepping into the
[1:22:30] supernatural where all things are
[1:22:32] possible
[1:22:32] there's not one thing on that tree a lot
[1:22:34] you can't attain to
[1:22:36] you can be healed you can be delivered
[1:22:38] you can be set free because while the
[1:22:40] tree of life has no wind
[1:22:47] i said the tree of life has no end
[1:22:50] we're not eating tonight off the tree of
[1:22:52] knowledge
[1:22:53] i did not go to sermons.com and get this
[1:22:56] message
[1:22:58] i went before the creator i said god you
[1:23:01] know the need
[1:23:03] god you know the need you can feed five
[1:23:06] thousand
[1:23:07] with two fish and five loaves surely you
[1:23:10] can come by tonight
[1:23:11] and feed bethel tabernacle notice now
[1:23:15] this virgin birch was a paradox how in
[1:23:18] the world
[1:23:20] excuse me could it be scientifically
[1:23:23] proven
[1:23:25] come on really think about this we're
[1:23:28] smart and educated
[1:23:29] as we heard we had a civilization years
[1:23:31] ago that created this
[1:23:33] the pyramids way further advanced than
[1:23:35] what we are
[1:23:38] and yet they still could not explain the
[1:23:39] virgin birth
[1:23:41] how could this happen because this
[1:23:44] ain't the results of man's ingenuity
[1:23:47] it's the work of
[1:23:48] god because god laid it in the
[1:23:50] scriptures
[1:23:52] a virgin is going to conceive a child is
[1:23:54] going to be given
[1:23:55] a son is going to be born and in the end
[1:23:58] time he says i'm going to have a church
[1:24:01] oh you look at yourself when you got
[1:24:03] mistakes how many you got mistakes
[1:24:05] i'm glad i got some honest people here
[1:24:07] tonight some of you got some flaws but
[1:24:09] he said i'm gonna have a church
[1:24:11] without spot without wrinkle
[1:24:14] without blemish she's gonna be a
[1:24:16] glorious church
[1:24:20] i'm talking to you tonight church of god
[1:24:22] that's who you are
[1:24:23] quit listen to the lies of the devil
[1:24:25] telling you you're not this
[1:24:27] you're never gonna be and you're not
[1:24:28] good enough oh it's just a lie the enemy
[1:24:30] god says you can you will you will
[1:24:33] because why because i've already seen
[1:24:35] you
[1:24:35] in a vision
[1:24:38] going up not down
[1:24:42] notice now he healed the lepers
[1:24:46] when there was no cure for leprosy
[1:24:49] he fed the 5 000 with just merely
[1:24:52] two fish and five loaves he delivered
[1:24:56] from the lions then he delivered from
[1:24:57] the fiery furnace
[1:24:58] he created a highway through a raging
[1:25:00] sea
[1:25:02] and you think your problem's too big for
[1:25:04] our god
[1:25:05] oh no he loves the impossible
[1:25:10] because when man can't figure it out
[1:25:12] god's sitting back
[1:25:14] i got this
[1:25:17] i got this only thing he's waiting on is
[1:25:20] for you
[1:25:21] and say take it lord i believe
[1:25:25] be it unto me notice we find here
[1:25:28] in mark 11 verse 23 is this okay tonight
[1:25:31] can i keep going
[1:25:34] well i'm gonna keep going and ain't
[1:25:36] telling me nothing
[1:25:38] he says verily i say unto you
[1:25:42] that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:25:44] mountain be thou removed
[1:25:46] and be thou cast into the sea and shall
[1:25:48] not doubt
[1:25:50] in his heart but shall believe that
[1:25:52] those things which he saith shall come
[1:25:54] to pass
[1:25:55] he shall have whatsoever he said
[1:25:59] therefore i say unto you what things so
[1:26:02] ever you desire when you pray believe
[1:26:04] that you receive
[1:26:05] and you shall have them now this phrase
[1:26:08] here this scripture
[1:26:10] these mountains are proverbial and
[1:26:12] they're supposed to
[1:26:13] to to look at difficult or impossible
[1:26:16] situations
[1:26:17] that's in a christian's path and god is
[1:26:19] here to tell you
[1:26:20] no obstacle should be able to stand
[1:26:23] before
[1:26:24] a confiding faith in god there's no
[1:26:27] obstacle
[1:26:28] that's greater than our god
[1:26:31] your god is greater than your mountains
[1:26:33] and your valleys
[1:26:36] he's greater and god is saying
[1:26:39] whosoever shall speak to this mountain
[1:26:41] your mountain may be different excuse me
[1:26:49] your mountain may be different than my
[1:26:52] mountain
[1:26:54] but it's still impossible
[1:26:57] with us brother timothy and i were
[1:27:00] texting
[1:27:01] a while back and i'm going to go into a
[1:27:02] little bit more of this but he was he
[1:27:04] and i were texting and he texted me this
[1:27:05] text
[1:27:06] he said we are assigned mountains to
[1:27:08] show others
[1:27:09] that it can be moved
[1:27:14] he said david showed others that goliath
[1:27:16] could be killed
[1:27:20] shamgar showed others that 600
[1:27:24] wasn't enough
[1:27:28] samson showed others that a thousand
[1:27:31] wasn't enough
[1:27:34] daniel showed others that the lines then
[1:27:37] can be
[1:27:38] shut the three hebrew children showed
[1:27:41] others
[1:27:42] that the fiery furnace can be put out
[1:27:46] and jesus showed others that death
[1:27:49] itself can be defeated
[1:27:54] and i replied to brother timothy and i
[1:27:57] said
[1:27:59] god is using your family in our church
[1:28:02] to prove that he will keep his word
[1:28:06] and that we can trust him or if we trust
[1:28:09] him
[1:28:10] mountains will move goliaths will fall
[1:28:14] philistines will be defeated fires will
[1:28:16] be quenched
[1:28:17] and the lions will be tamed if
[1:28:20] we believe see god has proven time and
[1:28:24] time again
[1:28:26] that he can do the impossible but who is
[1:28:29] god's agent
[1:28:33] you are god's agent god performs his
[1:28:37] impossibilities
[1:28:38] through your weakness of your humanity
[1:28:41] see god has proven he's opened a red sea
[1:28:45] and they walk right on through the
[1:28:47] hebrew children never before has anybody
[1:28:50] survived
[1:28:51] to heat of the flames and yet they
[1:28:54] walked out without the smell of smoke
[1:28:56] on their clothes never before has
[1:28:59] anybody
[1:29:00] survived a dent of hungry lines
[1:29:05] oh but daniel said o king i'll see you
[1:29:08] in the morning when this trial is over
[1:29:11] i'll see you tomorrow oh come on sons
[1:29:15] and daughters of god
[1:29:17] he's still god tonight never before has
[1:29:21] a man been dead for four days
[1:29:23] came back to life again stinking
[1:29:26] decaying body parts already rottening in
[1:29:29] and yet he walked out alive and not only
[1:29:32] did he walk
[1:29:33] out a new man he walked out and god said
[1:29:36] or jesus said
[1:29:37] loose him and let him go what was he
[1:29:39] doing he's saying your past can't hold
[1:29:41] you
[1:29:41] oh your past your mistakes can't hold
[1:29:44] you you come up
[1:29:45] dead from the grave but i'm not going to
[1:29:47] let the past hang on you

[1:29:51] them serve god
[1:29:52] let them worship god let them praise god
[1:29:54] tonight
[1:29:55] let the past come off of them and let
[1:29:57] them be free to serve me again

[1:35:47] and uh i prayed with her and and i
[1:35:50] stayed there until they transferred it
[1:35:51] to a bigger facility
[1:35:53] that had a neurologist and as i was
[1:35:55] there waiting i went to the doctor i
[1:35:57] said doc

[1:36:07] slide
[1:36:08] because it's a slice so he's going
[1:36:09] through there and he showed me he says
[1:36:11] you see this middle line here

[1:36:29] brain from the front
[1:36:30] to the back was full of blood and the
[1:36:32] blood was pushing the brain matter over
[1:36:35] to the right side

[1:36:38] midline
[1:36:39] shift i said okay doc i said how bad is

[1:37:02] gonna do the impossible
[1:37:06] i just preached on the god of
[1:37:08] impossibilities a god does impossible
[1:37:10] math
[1:37:11] so i was a little bit stoked i said yeah
[1:37:14] we got this you know i'm not a clinician
[1:37:18] i knew it was bad because they told
[1:37:20] brother tim you tell us you want her on
[1:37:21] life support or not
[1:37:22] get ready because she may not make it
[1:37:24] through surgery so she made it the very
[1:37:26] next morning
[1:37:27] they shipped her to ochsner which is a
[1:37:29] hospital big hospital teaching facility
[1:37:31] in shreveport
[1:37:32] they done emergency brain surgery in the
[1:37:34] morning to relieve the blood off the
[1:37:35] brain
[1:37:37] and every day from then she began to
[1:37:39] improve and improve
[1:37:40] and brother tim would begin to talk to
[1:37:42] her and she would squeeze his hand
[1:37:44] now she was supposed to be a vegetable
[1:37:46] she was supposed to not have a quality
[1:37:48] of life
[1:37:49] she was supposed to not be able to walk
[1:37:51] again she was supposed to not be able to
[1:37:53] think again
[1:37:54] to walk again i'm going to testify she
[1:37:56] went home yesterday
[1:37:58] a healed woman why because he's the god
[1:38:01] of the impossibilities
[1:38:03] there's nothing to impossible with god
[1:38:06] and there's nothing to impossible with
[1:38:07] you
[1:38:08] if you can believe god she went home and
[1:38:11] she's rejoicing
[1:38:12] in her right mind got full control of
[1:38:15] our motor skills why
[1:38:17] because we serve a mighty god we serve a
[1:38:20] miracle-working god we serve a
[1:38:23] supernatural god
[1:38:24] and there's nothing let me hear me
[1:38:26] there's nothing impossible with god
[1:38:30] and there's nothing impossible with you
[1:38:32] if you can believe god
[1:38:36] oh yeah we facetimed her from the beach
[1:38:38] the other night
[1:38:40] and she's talking and she's doing
[1:38:43] everything great
[1:38:44] and she wasn't supposed to be alive
[1:38:50] i said she wasn't supposed to be alive
[1:38:53] she could live five minutes maybe five
[1:38:56] years
[1:38:57] but she will not have a quality of life
[1:38:59] notice every one of these that i read to
[1:39:01] you
[1:39:02] had a death sentence on them but they
[1:39:04] believed
[1:39:07] they believed and we believe tonight
[1:39:13] they believed in the impossible
[1:39:16] and new life came
[1:39:20] and if you can believe tonight for the
[1:39:22] impossible
[1:39:24] new life it's on its way
[1:39:28] if you can believe for the impossible
[1:39:31] i said new life it's on its way i don't
