========================================

Dear gracious Lord, I come before you this morning, Father, we're coming together for this little Sunday school service, Lord, that I have this thought upon my heart. That Lord, that I I know is from you. And Father, we're coming together now to ask that you would come down and anoint my lips, anoint the hearts of the people. Let us open our hearts to your word, Father, we could take hold of it, that it could be revealed to us and that we could manifest it again in this day. And Father, as we would turn to your word this morning, that first we would turn to the author that you would be in it and that you would reveal yourself to us a little bit this morning. We ask it we invite you into this service in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Um let's all turn to um I'm going to start with Revelations chapter 10 and verse one and we'll read a text and then y'all can be seated. Um, so re, this is Revelations 10 and verse one. And it says, "And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire." You all can be seated. Um, so, uh, I'm going to read that and then, um, just for the sake of time, um, I'm going to just, I just have it noted down here. Um, this is Revelation 4 and verse one. It says, "And after this, I looked, and behold, a door was open in heaven. Um, and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said, um, is that King James? Can you pull up Revelation 4:1?" There we go. Um, uh, uh, trumpet talking with me, which said, "Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be hereafter." Um, in verse two, um, and immediately I was in the spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven. One sat on the throne, and he that sat uh was to look upon like a jasper and sardine stone, and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. And round about the throne were four and 20 seats. And upon the seats I saw four and 20 elders sitting clothed in white raignment. And they had on their heads crowns of gold. Now, um I'm reading this and I'll I'll give you a little bit of a backstory where this thought came to be. Um I was we were going to Walmart, me and my lovely wife, and she is now in the stage of pregnancy where we're rearranging furniture and making baby clothes. Um which I think is called nesting. And um the uh so she's she was wanting to make baby clo this dress and it had you know was kind of colorful and it was kind of rainbowy and she was like it kind of looked like a rainbow and she's like well I'm worried that you know her birthday's in June and people are going to get a weird imp impression that you know she's got a rainbow dress on and I was like no this is ridiculous. I'm not going to let the world take that because God clothe himself in rainbows. that this is so integral to who God is that he clothes him he wraps himself in a rainbow that even Joseph who is a type of Christ had to wear a rainbow in order to be that perfect type. It's very integral and it's not an accident and it's not a um it's not just a throwaway thing. It's not just a a bizarre happen stance that in the modern age the rainbow has become associated with something not of God. Right? That's not an accident. that's not, you know, and I'm not even necessarily saying that it's people who are part of that movement, but some intelligence somewhere associated that rainbow with something perverted. Okay? And it's the more I looked into this, the more I looked into what a rainbow is, what it represents, I was so floored by just how deep this is. And so that's what we're going to talk about um is uh rainbows and what it represents and why God associates himself with that. Um so one thing I would like to note about Revelations chapter 10 where he said he was clothed in a cloud and his face shine like a sun and there was a rainbow about his head. Amen. Notice the two things that make a rainbow is water and clouds and sunlight. So here's Christ clothed in a cloud. His face is shining like the sun, which makes a rainbow. Okay. Um so if the if this rainbow is made up of two components, water and sunlight, I got to think, all right, well, what is water represent scripturally, right? What's the what's the type there? Um and the water there's two different ways that you can interpret the um what water represents where it types out. The first is that water represents the word. Amen. Okay, we know the washing of the water by the word that this is um that when the the you know that that would be water and then light um and there's you know I could read some a lot of quotes on this but I I'm just for the sake of time. Light is associated with revelation. Amen. Okay. Right. Obviously there's the obvious I mean just go from foundations, right? Darkness conceals, light reveals. Amen. Okay. Um when Christ's face is revealed, it shines. Um revelation is almost always associated with light. When Christ is revealed to uh to Saul before he became comes Paul, it was through what? A light. Um uh even even when uh we start having a restoration of the of Revelation in the church ages under Luther, this is what we commonly refer to as the enlightenment period, right? Okay. Um uh even when the Holy Ghost is revealed on the day of Pentecost, it is revealed in a multitude of lights, right? Licks of fire. These are individual lights. Revelation is always associated with light. And so a rainbow is the word revealed, right? It is revelation passing through the word which then separates out into a a greater fullness. Right? It's you can see the white light of the sun, but when it passes through the word, it separates out into a fullness that you can now see. All those colors are in the white light of the sun, but unless it passes through the word, you don't fully realize what's there, right? It becomes a fullness. And so this is exactly where you know as the church when you feed on the word when revelation strikes you and you see the fullness there's seven colors right all these seven colors or the seven redemptive names of Jehovah can be the Jehovah can be in his fullness to you be through revelation of the word. This is why read your Bible and pray every day. Feed on the word and then pray for revelation right? feed on the word, water the word, you know, get water and revelation, and then whatever situation you're in. Now, we say that there's seven colors in a rainbow, and that's true. I'm not disputing that. However, something to bear in mind. Interesting thing about rainbows is they are actually technically an infinite number of colors, right? Within each hue, each of those seven hues, if you break it down scientifically, those are just created from the infinite spectrum of light wavelengths. Amen. That can be then sorted out. And so within whatever situation that you're in, no matter how unique or specific or wowy wowsy woo, no one has ever suffered like I have, right? I'm special and out of the billions of people. Well, within each hue of light, there's an infinite number of shades of that color. Okay? The within each redemptive name, there's an infinite number of ways that God can interact with you to meet you exactly where you are at. Okay? You may be one of 30 billion people to have existed, but 30 billion is nothing in comparison to infinity. Okay? There's an infinity ways that God can deal with you and your problems. All right? No matter where you're at, no matter what situation you're in, the the when you find revelation of the word of God, it will meet you where you're at. Okay? Amen. Now the other aspect of this where water also uh can be typed out is that water represents the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost um in the people. Okay, we can see this with the smitten rock. Moses striking the smitten rock. Christ is the smitten rock. Out from him flows the spirit. Okay, that we now have access to that Holy Spirit in the church. And so which might sound like some sort of a contradiction but bear in mind the Holy Spirit is the word. The word was in the beginning was the word. Right? See John chapter 1 that that what the Holy Spirit is is simply the word in a form that is capable of indwelling within a person. Amen. That's what the Holy Spirit is. That it is it is the word with the ability to indwell within a person. When huh when that happens, okay, when when the when the spirit of God dwells within a person, they are now the word, right? Amen. Made into flesh, compacted and condensed into a flesh package. Amen. Right. I I don't have the time to read a lot of quotes, but there's a lot of quotes on that. Um the the everything you know all that Christ was he poured in or all that God was poured into was Christ and all that Christ was was poured into the bride. Okay. The bride of Christ full of the Holy Ghost full of the Holy Spirit is nothing short of the word made flesh in this day. That's what that is. And when when Christ is revealed through his bride, right? All those redemptive names are now manifested through her. Right? When you uh act, you become Christ on on earth, right? you. That's what Christian means, doesn't it? Believers never named themselves Christians. The world did that, right? Christians just behaved the way the Holy Spirit led them. And the result was everyone around them could see that that was that they had seen this before, right? This was a reflection of Christ. Christians, if you're a real Christian, people can tell, right? If and if and by the way if people can't tell then I have some questions about whether or not you're really a Christian, right? I mean that's that seems a little harsh, but you know bear that in mind. Your lifestyle being a Christian does not mean you go to church and you read out of a Bible and you you know have some sort of understanding of of scriptures. No, being a Christian means you have a lifestyle that reflects a Christ lifestyle. Amen. Okay. Amen. So when Christ is revealed through you, right, you become the the revealed word for your day, right? You you are that's why we say um you know uh when when you you know preach preach the word with all of your heart and when all else fails, use words, right? Your lifestyle preaches a sermon. Your lifestyle reveals Christ to the world. Amen. Okay. Huh. Now, um how much time do I got? It is going quick. Um, now brother Brandham talks about the rainbow. A lot of times if you just look up, you know, search the word rainbow, you're going to get a lot of quotes where brother Brandham over and over and over and over and over again shows the rainbow as he said the two ends of the rainbow are alpha and omega and then the seven colors represent the seven church ages. Okay, which again Christ being revealed through his people in those church ages. Amen. There each age required a different aspect of Christ to be revealed, a different color, right? It's all of the same God. It's all the same word, but it's being revealed with a different aspect depending on what was needed at that time. Okay? But it's still Christ revealed through his church, right? Creates the seven colors and and it begins and ends with Christ. Okay? Amen. Um he's the alpha and the omega. It references that the um the s the um oh the jasper and sardine stone. These represented Ruben and Benjamin which were the first and lastborn uh patriarchs. Okay, the beginning and the ending. Um but it's both Christ right now. This is where uh you know when we look at the rainbow and the other aspect of this obviously if you're any even Sunday school children should understand the rainbow represents the covenant right it's the covenant that God gave to Noah which was a foretelling of the covenant that God would give the world through the br the blood of Jesus Christ right that that around the the the world is this um this covering of blood that prevents the holy God from seeing the sinful earth and destroying it. Right now, if you notice in when brother Ram tells the vision of when he, you know, he he goes up and he sees the earth and it's surrounded by the blood and then the sins come up and and and pass through that that uh that barrier. The way he tells that, he says when he saw the earth, it was surrounded by a rainbow and then a voice told him that rainbow is the blood. Okay? So it's the earth surrounded by a rainbow or a covenant that that prevent that is preventing the earth from you protecting the earth from destruction. Um notice uh when you look out and see a rainbow, right? You see the beginning and you see the ending and you see the rainbow in the middle. If you I was doing some research on this and and the the the science it was a.gov gov like science website um was the way they worded this I thought was beautiful. They said if you were to start lifting off of the ground and start floating higher you will start to see that the rainbow is actually a circle and it looks like a a arch because that's all you can see because the terrain gets in the way. But the higher you go once you get above it you see that the rainbow is a circle. Right? We see the church ages and the and the the finite arc of time and God sees an infinite circle. God sees an infinity. What we see as an alpha and omega, right? A beginning and an ending. It's all the same thing. The start line and a finish line on the racetrack are the same line, right? The alpha and the omega are the same thing, right? And the time, you know, all the the it's all it's all a a circle, right? It's infinite. the the the covenant is infinite, right? It's not just, you know, from here to there. It's all the way around. And as you lift up, this is man, I about I woke my poor wife up cuz I almost launched out of bed this morning when I read this. Do you know when I'm reading about this, there's a term that pilots have from a rainbow from above. Do you know, does anybody know what pilots call a rainbow that you can? It's called a glory. Amen. It's called a glory. That when you're looking from above and you see a circular rainbow, that is called a glory. Now, I want to read something. Uh, pull up Ezekiel 1 and verse 26, please. Um, and I can start reading it here. Um, do we got nothing? What was it? Ezekiel 126. And I'll I'll let them catch up. I'm just going to start reading. Um, this is verse 26. And above the firmament that was over their head was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone. and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man upon it. Verse 27. And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about it. Verse 28. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness roundout. And uh this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake. Okay, so here's Ezekiel saying that the glory of the Lord that goes all the way around his throne is is a rainbow, right? that huh from above the rainbow is a circle that God's glory and and notice in Revelations chapter 10 when he has a rainbow above his head it's not a bow it's a halo right it's you know the the rainbow goes all the way around and it's his glory right notice tying it back to where we started the rainbow is made of the word revealed through his people. That's what the rainbow is made out of, right? That God's glory is made of the word revealed through his people. That's the halo over his head. That's what he he surrounds his throne in is the word revealed through his people. His people living the word. Okay. Could you please pull up 1 Corinthians 11 and uh let me see where it's uh what the exact verse is. 11:7 1 Corinthians 11:7. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man. Amen. Okay. The bride of Christ again here even even in the way we live and dress you are reflecting that the bride of Christ is the glory of God. Right? That he would wrap himself in a rainbow that he would clothe himself in a rainbow is the word made revealed through you. That's what his glory is. Amen. And because why the his bride is his glory, right? The glory of the man and his is his bride. The um this is this is uh so key I think because even even it goes so far as notice when we said that the that the earth is surrounded by this rainbow right surrounded by the glory right the people God's people even so much in in uh in Revelations where it says he that letth will let until he be taken out of the way. Right? That the covenant, the covenant of the blood covers the earth so long as the bride is on the earth. And when the bride goes up, so does that blood covenant. It is taken out of the way because she's the covenant on the earth. She's the manifestation of that covenant. And when she goes, so does the covenant, right? God's glory goes with her, right? the um the And so now with all of this in mind, now do we see why it is so insidious to associate this covenant, this glory, this rainbow with something called pride, right? That here's Lucifer, right? I said it like this one time. If God is love, then Lucifer is pride, right? If God can be defined as love, then that's the defining feature of Lucifer is pride. Okay? And so, and he's going to raise himself up and take God's throne. He's going to take the place of God. So, what is he going to do? He's going to clothe himself in glory just like God clothed himself in glory. He's going to use a rainbow. Interesting thing about that, just as a side note, notice on the on the rainbow flag, they're all straight lines. It's not an arch. It has a beginning. It has an ending. They will never loop back around. Amen. That is a temporary, finite, doomed pride, doomed glory, right? It will terminate. Amen. God's rainbow does not. Okay. Second of all, notice I said that the that the glory of God is his church, right? It's his bride. It's the it's his word, the word made flesh and real in her. And then revelation through that. So what is Lucifer doing in this day? He's building a church, right? The entire church world will become sat. It's that's Satan's bride, right? That he will incarnate himself in a man of sin and surround himself in a church. Yeah. That's what he's there to do, right? And that's his glory. That's and and you can and it reflects him and everything that he is I mean the the glittering cathedrals and man it's it's crazy. You see um in this day like you you know there when I was my whole life it was never you never associated the politics with religion. It was just never in America especially you know we have separation of church and state and it was but anymore like you can't hardly listen to a political commentator you know half the political commentators in the country and they're all talking about religion. It's all integally linked with religion. And how many people It is stunning to me how this there's a massive shift of people going back to the Catholic Church. Yeah. And you know what the number one thing or at least one of the top reasons that I hear of people turning to the Catholic Church and saying that's the real church and and turning away from Protestantism. It's because well the Catholics and all these churches, God is beautiful. God is all the most beautiful things is in nature and God is in nature and that's beautiful. And so people building beautiful churches just shows that God is in those churches. Wow. Because it's beautiful. It's glittering massive cathedral stained glass, right? Beautiful artwork that you know you know and they'll criticize the the Protestants and say, "Oh, well, you know, we have all these beautiful paintings of people pouring out their their worship and devotion to the Lord in all this beautiful artwork and you guys say it's paganism." which I mean some regards it is but the point is there's a whole movement in this day and age to bring beauty to religion to bring beauty you know these massive cathedrals and and big spectacular things they want to beautify it because it's it's it's Satan glorifying himself it's building glory unto something false right but in this day and age where where the bride is called to is not some man-made glory, right? It's not some man-made architecture. It's not paintings and and murals and stained glass. That's not where God finds glory because that's the handiwork of man, right? Where God finds glory is in people who have yielded themselves to the word. Who've com kicked out everything of themselves and taken only the word and said, "Lord, you fill me all the way and let my life come 100% in line with the word that I can be nothing short of the word made flesh again." And that will create a beauty that no man can replicate, right? That will create I mean, look, you know, the great cathedral Notre Dame can burn down, right? But yeah, you can burn this temple to the ground all you want. It will still give God glory no matter what happens. It will rise again and there will be an eternal glory that comes from it. Okay? The the the the the glory of God is his bride. It is in his church and the yielding of her vessel to the full word of God. Amen. And that's where we quit. Amen. Let's let's stand and have a dismissal prayer. Father, Lord, we thank you for this word that you've given us this morning. Trust that it might bless somebody, might encourage somebody, might give them uh an encouragement of whatever they may face, that they would be able to hold to a promise. Lord, I ask that you would be with us throughout the remainder of the service into the song service as we would worship you. that we would
