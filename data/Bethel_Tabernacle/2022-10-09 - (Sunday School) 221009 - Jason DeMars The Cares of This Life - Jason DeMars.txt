TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] father we come before you now Lord and we ask that your Holy Spirit would just guide and lead us Lord through the day Lord through the topic this morning through the the worship Lord and through the preaching of the word may you be glorified and lifted up in all things Lord help help us to get our human side out of the way to Lord let your divine presence flow through to the hearts of the people Lord anoint your word make it alive we ask in Jesus name amen I'm gonna start speaking on the cares of this life and uh looking at it in the in in the realm of distraction or stewardship or both I guess you could say so you've probably all read that scripture but we'll read it together and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares amen you can be seated so how many know the definition of the word surfing well I do now but when I read it when I read this I definitely was like like what is surfing it's not surfing so don't worry brother Travis if you're listening in it's it's something completely different it speaks with it speaks of carousing it would be one of the words that we have it's means to have a noisy loud time while drinking alcohol so basically it means going to a British pub is pretty much what what that is right there and so uh the word overcharged means to be burdened or weighed down or if it even can speak of being dulled so Jesus is warning them you know if we look at the larger context of this he's speaking about the coming of the Messiah the end times and he's saying you know it's really a warning for believers of every age because no matter what age you're living in whether it was a first second third fourth fifth sixth you're supposed to be living in in a way that he could come at any moment and under expectation that he's going to come at any moment that the Rapture is going to take place and so but it really uh even further and more deeply applies to the seventh Church age and even more even more so the end of that seventh Church age we these are the things Jesus is speaking of that can prevent us from living our lives with anticipation and expectation for the Lord to appear in the rapture and so he's saying don't let your hearts be dulled burdened way down with what we're supposed to carry a burden in our heart the burden of the word of the Lord burden for God's people a burden for prayer but not a burden because we've been going to to the bar and drinking and partying hard that's not the kind of burdens that we're supposed to carry those types of burdens honestly it's a very ostentatious obvious and for most Christians a very much avoidable burden that is not likely to weigh down the heart of a a believer of the message now it could but when we're talking about sins that trouble us as message Believers followers of the word of this day it's that doesn't make the top of the list drunkenness and partying for many of us there's no appeal there's no desire there but then Jesus goes to something else that can easily impact all of us and he says the cares of this life and I think in this in this time that we're living in this is the biggest thing that can weigh us down again overcharged burdened weighed down dulled dold is probably my favorite way to define that because that's just what this a the laodicea and age does to us it dulls us that's Satan's purpose he knows he's not going to deceive the elect though he tries but he's certainly going to do everything he can to bring us to that lukewarm dull condition and so don't be overcharged with burdens and cares of this life so what does that mean what are the cares of this life so are you not supposed to care at all no it's not in that sense this word care is speaking of anxiety or worry so anxiety or worry over the things of this life can lead us to a place where our hearts are dull so what are what is the cares what are the worries of this life let's let's think about that for a minute Matthew chapter 6 verse 25. therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than Raymond and the body more than meat behold the fowls of the year for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not much better than they which of You by taking thought can add one qubit onto a stature and why take you thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if God so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o you of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knows you have need of them so this is speaking of the cares of this life brother Branham says in the trumpet gives an uncertain sound Grant Lord that those who have never come will find that precious freedom of being free turned out of the cage no more Bound by the things of the world and the cares of this life but has been made free in Christ granted father we can become captives in bondage to the things of the world yes we get that but also we can become captives and in bondage to the cares of this life and we need to get C free from that the cares it's again it speaks of anxieties and worries when Jesus says take no thought what do you think he's telling you don't even think about it no it's again this is an Old English word when they when they said I'm taking thought about this they meant I'm worried about it that was their expression that was their statement don't uh don't worry don't have an anxious thought about it trust trust the Lord trust he'll take care of you at the same time we can become captives to those things of this life how do we become captives when we put our Focus completely on them when we seek those things first and and when we let that turn into anxiety and fear the devil Works through anxiety and fear God works through faith so again this these this series of verses misinterpreted creates monasteries and creates super spiritual people that are in such a condition where they don't even think about food and they're just they're mooching off everybody else and you you see what I'm saying is you you can take those things and say take no thought for that and the next thing you know you don't work you've refused to work you're just you're just in prayer all the time um you're just so spiritual and the reality is you're not being spiritual at all because you're not doing the will of God so Jesus speaks of food he speaks of clothes and he speaks of water these are basic necessities of life he doesn't add a roof over our heads but I'll just go ahead and say for a hard day and age that's one of the things that we seek after we need these things these are not light things they're not unimportant you can't survive without these things um you know some people can survive better than others without a roof over their heads but if you're like me you need a roof over your head and so the Bible actually commands us to think about and plan for food clothes shelter water and work you realize it's not telling you don't think about it oh I'm thinking about my job stop that I was thinking about what I'm gonna where I'm gonna get my water don't think that's not what it's telling us don't worry don't be in fear over it that's what's forbidden is anxiety we're commanded to trust God for his provision and then take the steps that He commands us to take to be sure that they're taken care of Proverbs 6 verse 1. and if you can pull up the um NLT on that version there Josh be great my child if you have put up security for a friend's debt or agreed to guarantee the debt of a stranger if you've trapped Yourself by your Arrangement agreement and are caught by what you said follow my advice and save yourself for you have placed yourself at your friend's Mercy now swallow your pride go and beg to have your name erased don't put it off do it now don't rest until you do it save yourself like a gazelle escaping from a hunter like a bird fleeing from a net take a lesson from the ants you lazy bones in the KJV it says you sluggered learn from their ways and become wise though they have no Prince or Governor or ruler to make them work they labor hard all summer Gathering food for the winter but you lazy bones how long will you sleep when will you wake up a little extra sleep a little more Slumber a little folding of the hands to rest then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit scarcely scarcity will attack you like an armed robber so it's clear this the this is speaking of hard work careful forethought planning preparation saving looking towards the future understanding when you in those days when winter came for them for them in in the lands of the Bible it was rainy season so that wasn't a time for Harvest and for for growing crops very well so they were to work hard during that dry season the summer so that when it came to that time they had food in store yeah and and they were supposed to give they're supposed to give their first fruits they were supposed to tithe these were things that God expected of them he didn't say just sit and wait for things to work out he told them to work make preparation and put things in store and he can think the Bible condemns laziness and it commends hard-working forethought and saving Proverbs 21 verse 5. good planning and hard work lead to prosperity but Hasty short shortcuts lead to poverty the the desire to get rich quick is condemned by the Bible what what is encouraged plan plan ahead and hard work that's what's encouraged by the Bible Proverbs 24 27. do your planning and prepare your Fields before building your house in other words get your job figured out get a job work hard get everything right make things ready then buy a house don't worry about well I got to get a house I got to get this taken care of and then I'll find a job that's not scriptural plan prepare buy a house no or rent a house whatever you whatever you need to do the point being is the Bible is teaching us to take thought not to worry to plan proverbs 10 verse 4. lazy people are soon poor hard workers get rich a wise youth harvests in the summer but one who sleeps during Harvest is a disgrace again you could see what the Bible is encouraging and speaking of Proverbs 13 11. and I'm going to read it from the ESV wealth gained hastily will dwindle but whoever gathers little by little will increase it little by little save up every month save for emergencies save for the future be careful be wise Proverbs 21 18. if you want to switch back to the uh KJV there I said 21 18 28 18. whoever walks in Integrity will be delivered but he who is crooked in his ways will suddenly fall whoever works his land will have plenty of bread but heals follows worthless Pursuits will have plenty of poverty a faithful man will abound with blessings but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished you see again it's it's hard work it's planning it's forethought it's Integrity honesty truthfulness these are the things that will put give you success in your life now Proverbs 21 verse 20. there is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise but a foolish man spends it up there again there's treasure there's save another way we could say there's a savings there's storage of oil in the dwelling of the wise why because he's carefully planned and thought ahead and put things aside for the future but a foolish man he just spends everything that he has it's essentially what that's saying so the Bible is telling us it's not wise to live paycheck to paycheck some of us have to some of us do we do our best but we'll do our best to work towards the place where okay we can save a little bit every month we can put put aside for emergencies the Bible is giving us very practical and wise steps to take it's not giving us super spiritual just pray and wait in your room until gold a bag of gold hits you in the head that's not what God that's not how it works that's not what God wants he wants diligence whether you're a preacher or a laborer or a business owner a farmer an I.T person a manager whatever work you do it's telling you to work hard you should be the best worker you should be the most favored person oh you should all be Joseph at your job you might not be the the CEO you might be on the you might be on the lowest level but your boss should look and say this person I can trust them they have integrity they're honest they work hard and God will God can bless that but if you're lazy and just go there and just expect everyone to take care of you how can God bless that he can't he never will so when we're talking about take no thought it's not a super spiritual statement it's literally telling don't worry about it but I what if I have this I don't know if I can do this do the things that God told you to do and let him take care of the rest if you don't have a job that your full-time job is to look for a job it's these these simple simple things they're not it's not complicated it's not complex understand that there's other situations and circumstances there's sicknesses there's all these different things that happen in people's lives nevertheless the principle stands whatever position or place you find you're in yourself in you work hard you do your best to prepare for the future as best you can but you don't you don't go in that preparation for the future you don't store up Barns and say like the man say oh Soul take your rest see that's getting that's out of balance there's a balance in this you can come to this place where you think so much about it what's the next step and that's that's your God you cannot serve God and money so the Bible is very clear we're to work hard be diligent we're to avoid laziness we're to get a job and make a plan before buying a home or renting a home or plan where to plan ahead for expenses we're to save for the future we're to save for emergencies we're to save little by little every month and we're to avoid trying to get rich quickly the wise do these things that's what the that's what the Bible shows us the foolish don't do these things second Thessalonians chapter 3. for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but our busy bodies now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread in other words keep your mouth shut do your job and make provision for yourself and for your family if you another scripture says if you don't provide for your own you're worse than an infidel let's go to Matthew chapter 6 again verse 33 and 34. let's go let's go now to the back how do we balance this out we have responsibilities we have stewardship we have things we have to do in this life but they're not supposed to become our God they're not supposed to be our primary focus right we're not we're not supposed to seek those things first what are we supposed to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you all these things are what what did he say food water raiment and I'll just add as a result of that you'll also have a place to live see ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you so that's that should be our first approach our first Vision our first priority verse 34. take therefore no anxious thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof many times I looked at this verse and I approached it in the sense of just don't even think about tomorrow just think about today well how do you do that when the Bible's telling you to save put aside for when winter comes you know it's take no anxious thought for tomorrow you're borrowing trouble you're worth what what is worrying it's Faith misapplied your it's imagination misapplied you're imagining negative things could happen well did God provide for today then you can trust the provide for tomorrow but that doesn't erase the rest of the Commandments of the Bible don't get so spiritual that you erase important commands of obedience to the word if you trust God and obey God then you'll seek his will in every decision that you make you'll work hard you'll give to others you'll plan ahead you'll save for the future you'll take care of your family those things are actually being obedient to God when you don't work hard when you don't save for the future when you don't plan ahead um when you don't give that's you're being disobedient it's very it's very plain through scripture however again you can easily get out of balance and say well I'm just being obedient to God putting my whole focus on work and all this stuff no that's not scriptural that's not balance you put God first in everything the job that you do the work that you do you don't put that before God you put God first so in other words if it comes between your work and worshiping God on Sunday you say I choose worshiping the Lord in church on Sunday amen right you know you don't it's one cop I promise you one compromise in that will lead to many many more compromises in that until you have no boundaries and no balance in your life start out right in your job there's no I remember one time I I started the job had a boss said you don't have to work Sunday then we got a new manager and said everyone has to work uh every day of the week and we're open on Sunday so you have to work I said no I I don't she said absolutely you do everyone else does I'm a Christian I don't work on Sundays we're all Christians I said okay that's fine but you understand it's not that I don't want to work on Sunday I don't work on Sunday so if you put me on the schedule for Sunday and I don't show up and you fire me you'll be firing me because I'm a Christian and he she backpedaled and immediately said I'm sorry I'm not trying to persecute you you don't have to work on Sunday it's fine but if I would have said oh man she's putting oh man no no pressure from a human being overrides the pressure that God is putting on me it never should if you put God first he'll take care of you even if you were to get fired from that job the Lord will give you something equal or better laughs Mark 4 verse 18. and 19. and these are they which are sown among Thorns such as hear the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in choke the word and it becomes unfruitful so there we are you have you have a choice you can seek first the kingdom of God in his righteousness and then God will take care of your needs or you can take it into your own hands and say you know what I'm not going to seek the kingdom of God first I'm going to take into them in my own hands but what are you doing you're choking the word when the management of our Affairs the property finances Etc comes to the state that we can no longer be good stewards of them and and also be seeking the kingdom of God first it's time to start selling property it's time to start giving away finances it's start it's time to start doing whatever is necessary cut your pluck your eye out cut your hand off in order to put the kingdom of God first whatever it is a job that's making you put the job before God quit the job sell the company it's that serious it should be that serious those things cannot come before God those things what is the Bible what does the Bible say they dull your heart becomes dulled by the cares of this world what does a dull heart do it doesn't have connection with God what else is it becomes lukewarm becomes weak in faith and what is it leading towards it's leading towards shipwreck where is your where is our prayer life let's act that let's let's ask that question where is our walk with God compared to seeking after the needs physical needs that we have in our family has it shouldn't the other things shouldn't come before that before God we put him first many times we go we go go go go for time and we add on add-on add-on and get to the place where like I'm not I'm not putting time I'm not putting God first in my morning I'm not putting God first in my day I've got so much responsibility okay fine you got there have I gotten there many times so you stop you take some time to stop if you have to get away if you have to throw your phone in the river whatever you need to do it so you can reassess where you're at and say okay this is subtracted this is subtracted this is gone this is gone because I can't seek God first when I have all of this or maybe it's not as many things as I mentioned maybe it's just one thing but reassess it and no matter what it is you you put God first I don't think it's going to be your family I don't think it's going to be quitting a job altogether although you may need to quit a job in order to do it if it's making you work on Wednesdays and Sundays but usually it's reassessing your priorities and saying okay this is how it needs to happen moving forward God wants us to be good stewards but he doesn't want that to become our God he wants to be our god so let's let's stand and pray brother Branham says this in enticing Spirits he says give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that will God put God first in everything I'll show you a man will be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him Heavenly Father we just come before you Lord and our our desire I'm lifting my hand to you and saying Lord I want to put you first in everything Lord cleanse our hearts and cleanse our minds help us to reassess things Lord and and order our lives so that you're first in all things we ask Lord that you be with us today bless the musicians song leader preaching Booth every believer here Lord may your holy spirit guide and direct each one
