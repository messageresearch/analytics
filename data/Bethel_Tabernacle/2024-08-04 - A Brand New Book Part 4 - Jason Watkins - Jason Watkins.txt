that by your stripes we are healed this is are not going to be not might be but are healed amen and then uh it was pretty pretty awesome how today brother Matthew in his um Sunday school he was

Healer You're My Healer you and you alone [Applause] and the building project and um some fundraising ideas um so just a quick little update on you know um the prices and the costs and all that stuff and the brothers are working on putting together a spreadsheet with the you know line items listed of a cost of every phase of the project how it's broke down so that everyone can see where every dollar is allocated for this project um basically um we've already finished phase one and we've began phase two so phase one um was giving a facelift to the existing church here putting new siding new windows a paint new door um different things that we've done in here in this in the church already and on the outside um it also included phase one also Al included um the design we didn't pay for the design because brother Steve gifted that to the Lord and to the church but um the uh the blueprints the cost of the architect the permitting etc etc those costs all equal roughly about $60,000 um that has been paid for um phase two started with the the the land prep behind and on the sides um and then the pouring of the slab and um that was the kickoff of phase two the pouring of the slab and all the work we've done so far on phase two um is roughly $40,000 that we've spent so up to date we've spent roughly about $100,000 on the project um now the next part of phase two is the dryin the build and the dry in of the structure um that estimate is R roughly around $80,000 um those that's a very rough estimate so uh brother Matt and brother Tony are going to work on pricing the remainder of that out that doesn't include like the furniture inside the decor any of that stuff that's just getting the structure up and getting it like watertight um uh so as brother Tony and brother Matt are working hopefully in the next few weeks we'll we'll have that line item pricing um and so what we'll see um will be you know if our estimates were close or not you'll get a full view of that and um so the total price the total cost for um the phase one and phase two should roughly be around $180,000 mind you we've already paid a 100,000 okay so we have some work to do to get to the next phase brother Jason doesn't want to kick it off kick off like the build until we have the 880,000 or their abouts ready so that we can pay for it to be fully enclosed and dried in which makes sense because we don't want to put up you know start building with stick and and then we can't close it in because then the weather will you know the weather will damage the materials that we've paid for so um that being said when the liite when when we get a spreadsheet with all the line items we'll put it up here on the board and we'll give you some we'll go through some of the line items and you know for example we may have like the window package um line item line item 10 is the window package total cost $5,000 so when you see that amount you could say hey I want to sponsor that or me and you know brother Matthew we we're going to SP sponsor that $5,000 or whoever um it could be you know line item 25 I'm going to I'm going to buy all the plastic to wrap the inside of the building that's $3,000 I'm going to pledge I'm going to sponsor that that portion whatever that is the drywall the wood package um whatever those costs are you'll be able to see them you'll get a good view of what they are and then you'll be able to like take ownership for one of those line items if you so choose if you feel led um there'll be a lot of line items so Plumbing electric paint roof all of it um and again uh I just want to thank everyone for their giving so far and all the work that's been done um there has been a lot of work going on in the background that a lot of us don't see um with planning and so forth and digging and you know corresponding with contractors and so forth a lot of stuff um has been pledged there has been some not a lot but some some stuff have been pledged as far as materials um and for free that are going to be gifts to the Lord and to the church um time and material um both a lot of those things are being gifted to the church so I thank God for that but we have a lot of work to do Saints if we're serious about making room and we see what God's doing and bringing more families in and so forth we we going to need this room you know I think that the time is short and um we don't know what what other people the Lord is going to bring into our Lighthouse here but we want to make sure that there's room for them when they come can you say amen amen all right so um we want to bring up brother Brad Campbell come on up brother Brad we have he's he had a great um fundraising idea so we want to let him bring it before the church and explain how it all works and maybe even like how the Lord showed him um about this amen let's give Brother Brad a [Applause] hand God bless you Saints is this on cool whoever's on the camera can you do me a favor so I want this to be three things impactful I want it to be Unforgettable and I want it to be inspiring and I'd like to get everyone's attention even you CH children the kids all of you so in order to do that I'm going to get your attention good morning brother God bless you how you doing this morning you want to be a part of the building fund and of everything even the young people right okay well I have an idea I'm going to confess something to y'all because what happened with me was when when I found out we were doing this I'm like Lord and this is just the human side when when I found out we're were going to do this I remember going way back and looking at a building that we were going to purchase it was going to be several hundred, I thought oh my soul we're all just simple working people none of us have millions of dollars that I'm aware of we all work hard for our money right we all work hard to pay our bills every one of us do am I right we all struggle every one of us struggles so I prayed and prayed and prayed about this building fund and I'm not kidding you before I even donated I prayed for six months because it struck me in such a way that was so impactful and Unforgettable to me personally I thought Lord how am I ever going to be able to help with a building out back how am I going to do that I have no idea how I'm going to do that I already pay my ties or I try to try my best at the age I'm at with a Christian I try to pay my ties first hases anybody ever struggle with that you got bills that need paid you don't have enough but you're contemplating as a human do I pay my bills do I pay my ties and figure out how to pay my bills I remember that but I'm at the stage in my life where I can pay my ties first and then I pay my bills and and and then you know there's alms there's giving I don't know how you guys are as Christians but I know what I do as a Christian is I do simple things when I have an extra $5 in my pocket there's a guy in town you've all probably seen him he rides around on a bike like this right with his hands he can't move I always stop and give him money and I try to help people a lot of times I I've stopped at the bridges and you know homeless people are sleeping you you take your best expensive winter coat and you go lay it on them and you leave while they're sleeping I don't know if you guys are doing those things if you're not please start doing those things that's the kind of stuff we're supposed to doing as a Christian if you're not doing those things then I'm just telling you I want to encourage you to do them so I would like you all to just stand up with me real quick just stand up everybody please stand up now turn around everybody just turn all the way around don't turn all the way around and sit back down okay now I got your attention 100% okay so I've only got like three minutes so I don't have a lot of time left but what I wanted to do was share just a couple quick notes so after this six months I finally went to Brother kin and I said where'd he go Kenny okay I I said I got this great idea the lord gave me some inspiration and I shared it with him and then nothing ever happened I never took action and then about three weeks later a month later however much time passed I went out and shared my idea with um with brother Matt Watkins and uh while we were talking I don't want to take credit because it was actually as much his idea as at mine anybody see that model when you first came into church that's a finished product of what this building is supposed to look like when we're done so my point is when I prayed and prayed and prayed the the term that came to mind was compound interest and the Lord kept saying that to me compound interest well I understand the concept that's how investment bankers work they take all your money right they put it in escro account and they make money off of that and and that's how they make their money and then they give you some of the percentage or whatnot but that was the term compound interest so here's the thing let me just ask a question brother Mike Vel when you're out working on the job and you're sweating to death man you get in the car and you go to a gas station and you buy a couple cold drinks and a snack right we all do that when you're working on the job you that are Gideon when you go out HVAC and you're doing stuff you stop and you buy a soda how much is that soda $2 at least $2.50 we all do it every one of us does that frivolously with ourselves with our own money well here's the thing I'm about ready to do something I'm going to give this to Pastor in just a minute I'm going to do something that has never ever been done in a church before ever I promise you what you're about to see has never been done in a church and I wanted I just prayed Lord please my the inspiration that you gave me help me to convey this to the congregation so they all can be a part don't let me ask you a question don't you all in five years want to sit in that new building and look around and think to yourself I was a part of this I gave to this I sacrificed this little thing a week I sacrifice this I maybe I bought this chair I just even the children so the idea that came are these two things compound interest and here's how this works very simple I started doing this I don't know Pastor can tell you when I don't even remember it's been a few weeks but I put cash in an envelope every single time I walk in that door every time whether it's a dime a quarter $2 $10 I always try my best to have a little bit of cash in my my pocket because when I'm in a gas station I don't think twice about buying myself a drink not even twice I just buy it and so if you sacrifice that one just one time just sacrifice going and getting a drink oh I'm going to keep this two bucks every time you come in that door to church on Wednesday and Sunday if you would just put whatever you have in your pocket a dollar even if it's a dollar doesn't matter do the math a dollar from everyone in here every time compound interest we will have enough money to pay not only for the building for all of its contents we'll even be able to pay for phase three and and do the inside of this roof and everything it'll happen so fast it'll make your head spin God can do that if we are all apart so that was part one of what I prayed about for six months and I thought wow Lord that actually can work so I started doing it myself and I told pastor about it I told Brother Matt and then the second part was I knew somebody that did these models one of my clients Architects they put these models together and you know Matt and I talked about it and I think it was even Matt Watkins idea to actually make that into a bank I don't remember our discussion very well but so that's a bank that building has a slot in the top of it okay that's to do something real simple when you come in here I don't care if it's a quarter even if you only bring a quarter a simple single little quarter try to bring something I don't care if it's pennies you little kids you young people if you find a dime or a quarter laying around pick it up put it in your pocket with the intentions next time you come to church put it in that building we will have this building fund paid for in no time if that simple concept those two things will pay for everything I promise you it's that simple so I don't have much time left so I'm going to read a scripture and we're going to do one thing and then I know y'all want to hear the word are y'all hungry this morning for the word amen I don't know about y'all but the most important thing to me in my life is what is actually on my Epitaph bation is always talking about this life is not about your life but it's about the life to come and once you get that you're like you realize wow okay so it's about the life to come so you're supposed to be building up riches up there not here right and so I'm going to read a scripture that's not going to make any sense to you why I'm reading this particular scripture about this subject but I'm going to read it in Proverbs 22 it says a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver or gold I read that scripture for this reason names were on my brain this morning for various reasons doesn't matter but I told my wife I'm like you know what I've always thought that scripture was mostly about what you name someone and what your actual name is right that's why I've always thought that and then I was like the Lord actually gave me a little tiny nugget and he's like no it's not just about the name that you have and that you are it's about the end of your life what's on your gravestone what's on your Epitaph the end of your life what kind of a testimony did you have your name for you with this flesh that the Associated what testimony will you have at the end of your life will you have a good name will people remember you for all the good things that you have done have you tried to live a Christian Life have you given and I'm talking about giv I don't talk about your family we all want to help each other I'm talking about people you don't know will you have a good name so we're going to do this thing you've never seen this done in a church I promise you it's never one time ever occurred in any church anywhere brother Luther come on up here this is a basket he has one in hand I'm going to put money in a basket I'm going to put a whole bunch of change in a basket but Luther is going to pass this money out and you're all are going to take some every one of you are going to take some all right never been done in church ever one time offering here I'll dump this in your basket there you go now you can sort those mix all those up there you go I'm not going to say how much it is it doesn't matter brother please just pass it around make sure everyone grabs something grab a quarter grab and until it's all gone just pass it around everybody grab some money because what I want you to do with that money and some of you may even forget at the end of the service you don't have to get up now but at the end of the service I want you to take that money if it's on your heart you can keep it if you want doesn't matter to me I freely gave it but it it should go in that building fund building in the back back there now I want the kids to take it too okay because this can even be part of the kids the little ones even the young people brother you can sit in that new building and vision yourself in our new building finished saying I was a part of this I actually gave some of my own own funds to help this building fund two words y'all compound interest if you don't understand the concept go look up exponential growth it grows like this real fast in a year if we all do this this simple thing this is only $3 that's how much extra cash I had in my pocket that's my giving today it says building fund on it and it says my name well do the math somebody get out of calculator if they want Count how many people times $3 how much money goes into that towards our building fund if we do that eight times a month right there's usually four Wednesdays and four Sundays in a month we're going to have this building fund and none of us are going to be so burdened that when we get our tax returns and you know sometimes you can't discern between the Holy Spirit talking to you and your own human Spirit talking to you and you're like man do I fund or do I give this this much you don't have to do that you can if you want to I'm just showing you the Lord inspired me to get over my own self of how I personally am going to still be able to pay my ties pay all my bills live give alms still do the other giving that I try to do and now a building fund on top of that how can I be a part of the building fund simple everybody very simple amen thank you [Music] [Applause] amen let's give the Lord a hand amen it would be nice to have a little bit bigger m music room amen let's give the Lord another hand amen I will do my part Amen Let Us stand amen he's my Lord there is no other one who can come the storms of life like my Lord [Music] he gives rest to the we brings new light to the whole bless there's no doubt about it is my Lord [Music] oh he my [Laughter] Lord there is no other [Music] one who can calm the storms of life like my Lord oh [Music] he we bring new life to the whole there no doubt that's right about oh that's beautiful my Lord let's it up one more time amen let's fight the Lord's presence now he's my Lord there is no other one who can calm the storms of light like my Lord he gives rest to the we bring new life to the Hess there's no doubt about it he my Lord [Music] praise the Lord we're going to let you be seated just a moment amen we'll get transitioned here amen praise God fire in ho all right praise the Lord you can be seated God bless you should said it in Spanish amen praise the Lord Brother Ben amen greet you in the name of the Lord today happy to have you all here in the house of God Amen I enjoyed all of the worship and the singing and the uh missions report and all the specials really really wonderful greet all the visitors today we got a couple of prayer requests we're going to take up here in just a moment but I just wanted to uh say concerning all of the worship and the singing and the special singing and those missionary reports amen so I would like to say my name is Jason Watkins and I Endor endorse those everything you heard amen praise the Lord so we're glad to be um at this next stage you can see I'm sure you saw the model that was also um something Brother Brad pitched to me I thought it was Capital idea one of the best I'd ever heard and I didn't know you could build them um so cheaply and it's it was 3D uh print printed and then decorated so uh the only thing is that um we do have execution orders if Little Fingers happen to get get up there so moms if you don't want to lose your children brother Luther's under strict orders amen praise the Lord now everybody knows he won't do it CU all these little kids somehow love brother Luther I don't get it but they do they're not afraid of him they're just like you know the the ex Mafia Hitman thing doesn't affect them at all so we're happy amen for that but please try to be extra vigilant to keep little fingers who will just have a hard time resisting all those little trees things and little flowers amen so but I I when I looked at that I was I was stunned at what it could look like and so you know I think we have a good program going now just because we have a piggy bank that don't mean you can't still give abundantly beyond what you can your change I appreciate brother Brad's idea and I I will say that because of um because of who I'm married to Brother Brad I'm actually not even allowed to think once about getting a soda when I go into a store amen and by the way it's it's dbby y that's coming we all know Sister Debbie is a hurricane of sorts but she's not that tropical storm amen praise the Lord amen so we we we're I don't know we'll we'll see how that the lord always watches out for us keeps us safe so we're not going to worry about that too much amen looks like we'll have mostly some rain that'll be coming in so I'm looking forward to as brother Ken mentioned we've got the idea of line item sponsorship and um that's just kind of a something that hit the table when the brothers and I met the other day I didn't remember who suggested it first but I thought it was a great idea and uh you can you can pick a line item brother Anthony and brother Matt are putting together a detailed line item spreadsheet and you'd be able to do that you could pick several of them you can team up with somebody those who are streaming let me say you also uh can be a part and many have and we look forward uh to much more support I'm sure I don't need to preach on tithes and offerings every Christian pays their ties amen amen praise the Lord we've never had to preach too much on that here because your giving has always been very faithful I appreciate it even among uh the majority of our senior youth now those of you young people who are working jobs and been working jobs and haven't paid any TI shame on you and be a Christian and pay your ties that brother R says a Christian Pays His ties and offerings so it's absolutely part of of your worship to the Lord uh now we're not I told I said I'm we're not if you if you line item sponsor the sheetrock we're not going to let you put your family crest on the wall it's not going to be named after you we're not going to have you know a stepen Emily stove or anything like that we're we're not going to do that so but we will deeply deeply appreciate all your giving and I think that I I think we can be ready to go go uh brother Matt sent me just a quick note to just to just to clarify that the dry end stage is where we're trying to get to and uh let me not misquote him um but he says it doesn't mean everything except Furniture dried in means framed all plywood and tyvec exterior windows and doors and shingles it does not include rough trades drywall paint etc etc so um amen so I know brother Kenny knows that we just want to make sure that the way it got said that everything is clear it was U so we just want to double check that amen God bless you turn around and say God bless you to somebody sitting near you amen it's the nicest thing brother Bram said the nicest thing you can say to someone is God bless you amen praise the Lord so we're happy to have you all here today let's stand back to our feet and uh we're going to look at Luke Chapter 2 this morning greetings to our visitors here we're happy to have them uh with us today amen praise the Lord Luke Chapter 2 I believe I sent uh we'll start at verse 25 oh and let me get these prayer requests because we'll pray over them as we pray for scriptures um we want to continue to pray for little Addie and also Sister Amy they've both been quite sick and I told Sister Amy this morning that the devil has a good track record seemed like every time I go a abroad he comes in behind me tries to bring sickness into my home you know my wife and and even when my children were at home he would always try to do that and I said you know even if our heavenly father allows it Satan still ain't nobody amen he ain't nobody he does not make decisions about my life or your life he has no jurisdiction over me how about you um also Brother JD is ministering overseas brother Matt is ministering in Canada I think and I don't know if any of the other team members are deployed anywhere butth we want to just be praying for the ministry amen praise the Lord Brother Bruce sent in a request brother Jason good morning brother Jason would you please remember our daughter-in-law Rebecca in your personal prayers she was diagnosed with covid God bless you we're looking forward to the service this morning knowing our Lord will bring forth what we need to continue living a Christian Life that he might reveal himself through US Amen to that brother Bruce amen God bless you Brother Bruce and Parris Luke Chapter 2 this morning verse 25 we'll go down through verse 38 Luke 20 uh Luke chapter 2 verse 25 you got it say Amen we're continuing today uh part four of a brand new book we might be able to conclude it today the Lord willing that's the plan and behold there there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit to the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let thou let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou Hast prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy People Israel and Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him and Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and Rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yay a sword shall pierce through thine own soul that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed and there was one Anna a propheus the daughter of penu of the tribe of Asher she was of a great age and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity and she was a widow for about 4 score and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Israel let's pray father you heard our requests Lord that came in for prayer we're remembering Lord our team members who are ministering abroad carrying Lord the light of the Gospel pray that your great blessing be upon them Lord and give them strength and understanding father their families at home I pray for extra strength and Care over them Lord we're remembering particularly Sister Amy and Sister Addie under the attack of the enemy but Lord we pray against the work of the devil today and we condemn his works in the name of Jesus Lord we ask that the Holy Spirit The Enforcer of God's word will evict Him Father and move him into dry places that they may be well enjoying the service this morning father I pray for the request that Brother Bruce sent in father we realize that Lord people handle covid differently sometimes it can be very a great sickness sometimes not so much but Lord uh father in an abundance of caution we're asking father for your love and care to be on the scene right away Lord may you bless and heal and father we give you thanks and we praise you for all these things bless your word now that we've read bless both speaker and hearer we commit ourselves into your hands for service completely in jesus' name amen God bless you you can be seated I'll have my title slide brother Mark praise the Lord so we are continuing today with this a brand new book this will be part four fourth installment and uh I decid decited uh to keep the subtitle today because it uh it particularly works for me not a a simula a simulation but a shadow we talked about it a little bit last week I have one scripture verse that I want to go back and reemphasize our text and then I have uh a number of quotes from a single message that I've got for here and then that'll be it for the slide and then I have a couple other quotes I want to just read to you want to change it up a little bit today and again I'd like to take my time and be methodical because uh the burden on my heart uh is is somewhat Technical and so I just covet your prayer and I ask for your undivided and Keen attention I'm getting a late start so um but nonetheless you're you'll be okay I'm not a a marathon preacher everybody knows that so God bless you as we get underway so when we're looking at had a brand new book part four not a simulation but a shadow we look at our verse that we read and he came this was Simeon and this is what I want to look at particularly he came by the spirit into the temple when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up and his arms and he blessed God now it's amazing how the Lord is is is is wording this because when we read from our opening text the Bible says this that the Holy Ghost uh was upon him now that's very unique because the Holy Ghost came on Moses it came on Great Men of God down Through the Ages we know that there was a a distinct difference when the Holy Spirit came Upon Jesus and remained upon him and that we've taught on that before that was where John was told it wasn't it wouldn't be unique for John to see the spirit of God descend upon upon a person it had descended upon him from his mother's womb see so that part wouldn't be unique uh but there was a unique application in that said when you see it descend upon him and remain then you'll know that this is Messiah because that's never never been possible before that is to Simply say that God by the Holy Ghost had always been able to anoint his servants and his Messengers be they men be they women be they a prophet be they a prophetess you know those kinds of things operated down through the Old Testament so what I want to emphas I don't want you to get stuck on that today it's not the same thing as what fell in the upper room which is what you have access to and that's the beauty of it because because brother brandham talks about David and how that the thing that wearied David and this was David's weary that David he he said that I I I have kept the Lord his always before me I meditate on his word night and day I've tied it to my bedst I put it between my eyes I think on it constantly and so brother brandham says the thing that wearied David is even after doing all of that he still knew that he couldn't quite get it to live through him like he thought it ought to that he knew this is the spirit of God and it it somehow ought to have more control over my spirit and so that that was David's weary he said that's the thing that wearied David and I'm I'm glad today friends to say to you you don't have to suffer David's weary you have the ability now to let the Holy Spirit come inside you and give a change of your nature so that now you have an inside Force as well as a Heavenly influence and the word preaching now you've got it above you with you in you through you Hallelujah therefore greater is he that is in you good news greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you now have the actual ability it doesn't say you'll do it but now now you actually have the the true freedom to choose people walk away from the word of God because they say I want my freedom they don't realize only the word of God gives you your freedom otherwise you're not born again and you're subject you're still a slave to an old Fallen nature and the best you can do is grit your teeth because you don't want to go to hell and you would like to make a Rapture so you grit your teeth and try to live it I'm here to tell you that doesn't end well and after a while you wear out and after a while you collapse on that let me say to you today thank God it's not about gritting your teeth or performing a list of dos and don'ts Just Surrender and let the Holy Spirit come inside he will change your want to he will make you want to serve God he will make it a joy to surrender the things of the world now you'll still be tempted in the flesh but now you actually have the ability to deny it amen that's I call that freedom when I have the ability it doesn't mean I'll always do it J James said that there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man so quit crying stand up and act like a son or daughter of God get get away from brother like Brother Jules Says wowy wowy Wooo poor old me you know get over yourself there's no temptation taking you but such as is common to man I'll promise you you haven't suffered under blood so come on let let's let's be Sons and Daughters of god let's be rugged and so so we find out that that James says there's no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but within that that moment God will make a way that you may doesn't say you will but you could Escape it see so you have to really friends it's going to come down to this and hear me good I think this will help you it helped me this is these are realizations that have helped me all all my Christian Life to be an overcomer and to realize how to overcome better when I Stumble come on all you holy people yeah let's own it but but I but I but I I started thinking about it like this do I is my love for him greater than the lustful desire in My Flesh and I conclude every time yep it is I love him more than I than the desire of whatever happens to be trying to anoint My Flesh be it whatever it is the whole Gambit you know of of of of the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life and the lust of the those three deadly things that Jesus talked about and all the subcategories that go underneath them let your love for him that's why your your Christianity is not about working on it's not about working on trying to to overcome as in Works your your your work to do is to increase your relationship with Christ see and then the love of God will grow in your heart and you will find more strength than you would find mind when you don't do that good in order to have good things you know a a good relationship requires that you you you do good things within that relationship to keep it good all right so when you don't do that when you find yourself away from your Bible away from your prayer time your disciplines have fail your church attendance has fell your fellowship has fallen down on Hard Times you know I would just say to you today don't stay there kid back up pick up the sword press the battle you're only a half a step out of cadence it only takes a half a step to get back in military Precision see so we've demonstrated that to you before so now so when I when we talk about the spirit coming upon Simeon now I want to key on that I'm going to segue to my next point so when the when the spirit ComEd upon Came Upon Simeon it actually moved him so now if I could just say it to you in plain language that that we can really get so a human being got moved by an alien force amen so so there's more things alive than just what we can see in contact Brother Matt read us that quote not too long ago about how that you know great I forget how it goes great meetings and with great anointing and and he said you turn around and it feels like you bumped into somebody he said you might have just bumped into an angel these things are real this is what moved Simeon Simeon didn't just decide oh there's a there's a cute baby I'm GNA go see a cute baby Simeon wasn't just trying to you know believe you know and make himself believe Simeon got moved upon there was a for there was a spirit there was a positive not just a shadow see so we're not in a simulation as I said last time but we are in a shadow as a negative and brother brandham just said it's that great circle and that was all eternity but Adam and Eve fell from eternity and he said it put a little Loop down which Loops down in time for Redemption and then it brings comes back up into eternity we're almost ready to go back into eternity that's where we are friends that's where we are that's what's up that's what's happening right now I'm here to tell you it's not just going to go on and on and on it can't mankind is facing an Extinction event that he can't avoid knowing that he's doing it he can't help but do it am you're talking about being a prisoner that they know that they know nuclear war is Annihilation but they're going to do it they know Armageddon will bring an end to humanity but they're going to do it anyway say how do you know they're going to do it the Bible says they're going to do it the Bible prophesies about it see so so we realize that that I I want to get that in your mind today that in this Shadow existence that we live in there's a positive that's more real than this one and that's what was moving on Simeon and that's what you need to have moving on you watch now so brandham says in Harvest Time 1964 say I want to bring you conscious of that before we approach farther that God is in this room amen the author of this word is here God looks at your heart thank God and he looks in my heart and we're judged from our heart thank God not even our words our heart judges us from the heart speaketh the mouth if it if it isn't it's hypocrisy so in other words that either your heart is speaking and agreeing with God's word or your life is a life of hypocrisy see because you're living in a shadow realm that God never intended for you to stay in doesn't matter how long you're in this world you may live out your whole life and expire and your expiration date may come up and we may take you out to the cemetery but but I I want my life to count while I'm here I want it to be a reflection of a positive somewhere now it's that somewhere that's what I want you to be cognizant of today there's a somewhere that ain't here there's a something that's not this there's a higher than this lower there's a positive to this Shadow all right so he says he goes on now in this room now is coming human beings now he's going to talk about in the Realms of science this is going to be incontrovertible you're about to hear what he's going to say forms of human beings passing through here from all around the world voices singing in this room right now but you see you are only limited in your senses to a certain percent of sight but but now you can take the crystal or the tube or whatever that's in the television and turn it on and with with the set that could uh um let me catch up to myself here you can take the crystal or the tube or whatever that's in the television and turn it on and with that set that could deviate that on those ether waves and deviate that to condense it into a channel to pick up those people some in Australia South Africa or where India or wherever ever it may be now we know that's true there you you you know the television is not seeing Australia but Australia is broadcasting a signal of real people that is in this room in Shadow in negative your eyes don't see it but it's here and the proof is turn on the TV and the TV proves it's passing right here colors people see so now I'm starting to push your mind I'm doing this on purpose I'm trying to push your mind see now it took a profet to to to to bring all of this to our attention say well science knew that well they're not they're they don't know about what he's about to say watch this so he says just flip on the television see if um wherever it may be you can stand here on a screen and even see the color of clothes that they got the hair of the color of the trees and every move they make just flip on the television see if that isn't so all right now watch watch him take it to a deeper level then it's got to be somewhere hid from our eyes see that's the point he's making he's not his point is not about you know a television or a broadcast from Australia his point is that you don't see everything see but it's real see but you got to have a special set to see it and to hear it but it is real see it's a form of real all right so so he says then it's got to be somewhere hid from our eyes that same thing is passing through here now see remember he said God is in this room and then he uses that to kind of push your brain push your mind to go wow no no God actually really is in this room okay so he says that same thing is passing through here now it P now here watch this it passed through here when Abraham heard God say look up toward the stars now he's not talking about television he's talking about that same ether but only now it's not a a camera a a satellite broadcasting it's a higher power see it passed through here when Abraham heard God say look up towards the Stars it was here when Elijah sat on Mount Carmel you ever heard Einstein say that I promise you haven't it was here when Elijah sat on Mount Carmel it was here when Adam was here but they just now discovered it so who's the real scientist man or God see I remember as a child and my mom teaching me the Bible with her wonderful stories of the Bible that our our um youth are enjoying and that was one of the unique things she used to always point out to me in the Book of Revelation that the whole world would see Moses and Elijah laying in the street and Mom just looked at me and said how do you suppose that's going to happen without satellite television now I just think wow wow my mom is smart see and so is God here and the angels and someday you believe a prophet someday it'll be just as much reality as television or anything else is because the spirit will bring up into that Immortal Life then will'll understand so then we are speaking from his word see so now he goes on he jumps down quite a bit into into the message and he says here then after Adam had fell Tried by the word and fell God continued in his creation to find a man who would live every word amen now we all know he never did until Jesus all the Great Men fell somewhere where see beginning with Adam and they all fell but only finally Jesus didn't all the way from Adam to John the Baptist who acknowledged him and then doubted him see all the way to you know Moses who who lost his temper got kept out of the promised land Abraham who got caught conniving and lying twice see so and we won't even talk about Jacob brother BR said you got to really believe in the grace of God to count Jacob amen see and and Neah time would fail me to speak of David or or Samson see so but but the grace of God kept going the Christ seed kept going say how do you know kept going I'm here ain't I how do you know you're it cuz I believe this don't I Hallelujah you realize how impossible that is if you're not in the Christ line you can't believe this that's what this says it's only Those whom the Lord will reveal it to so as far as Redemption is concerned we know God Saves many millions from destruction granting them eternal life for various reasons he's very fair and everybody will get a fair trial don't worry you don't have to ask pondering questions what about the Heathen what about God's got a plan for that what about my neighbor who's got God's got a plan for that but but only the only the predestinated are considered in Redemption I'm here today preaching on Redemption I'm here preaching to people who are Redeemed by the blood of the the lamb God's got it all don't worry he knows way more about it than you do just trust him so so he says all right so he says um then after Adam had fell Tried by the word and God continued in his creation to try to find a man who would live every word now look he tried to find man that is live the word for his age now you see God scattered his word out because he could that's a good reason he is he is infinite and he is omnipresent omniscient therefore he knows all things he can't be present Everywhere by being omniscient knowing all things then he can be present everywhere see God is Not Like the Wind he is a being he lives in a house but his omniscience makes him everywhere at once cuz he knows all things so it's a form of being everywhere you got to you got to go I'm pushing your minds today friends you got to get you got to go beyond these little these little shadowy Realms that you live in I'm that's why we have a prophet who could come these secrets were always in the word of God but Menage men couldn't break into it because the secrets to Redemption are hidden the secrets to Redemption the parts of the Bible that refer to Redemption that it's election based on origin and it's it's it's in God before the foundation of the world all denominations deny that that they say brother Brandon went too far to say it like that it doesn't matter how many scriptures you read to them I've had them I've read them those scriptures and they try to tell me Well it don't mean that but I'm I'm telling you what it said I'm not trying to tell you what it means I'm telling you what it said Jesus said all the father has given me will come and I won't lose one and he said that thousands of years before the the church was even all had all come into the Earth you're here and you're a believer I'm here to tell you he saw you as a Believer and he knew you would be a believer see and this is why God will have mercy on many people who aren't in Redemption they'll still gain eternal life because you can't disbelieve what you don't know it's not given Jesus said that why do you speak in Parables because to you it's given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom to them it's not given lest they should see with their eyes and understand with their hearts and then I have to heal them I have to save them I have to redeem them and that's not my plan see and that's that's that's out there that pushes the Mind see but it's the truth so when he comes to this now so now then we come to where I was trying to get us to look at last time when we ran out of time because of the the Insight of a prophet we realize that we have positive and negative worlds now I'm not talking about a Multiverse that's science fiction that's their best idea they know there's something to it and there is something to it there is positive and negative worlds see you're brother brandham when if you want to interpret that correctly you look at brother bram's quote where you're in a great service and you're in a negative world but there's positive beings around you you might bump into one of them but when you turn you don't see anyone see so I mean what do you think it was that came into a negative Shadow and took a a vessel specially built as prophets are and brother brandham would say now the woman Fades out and he says the pillar of fire moves between me and the woman and she Fades out he says oh I see you're in a doctor's office now he's in he's in her past and your doctor is a little short fat man with big thick glasses and he's trying to say to you that you have and brother brandham couldn't even pronounce it and he said he said you have do and she says do aema he goes yeah do do aema I heard him say that to you and he says now you don't have it anymore Jesus Christ makes you whole now he's in the future so brother brandham said you see and this is his language he said see you go somewhere and he said but there's still he said that's why you'll hear brother brandham say if the audience can still hear me he didn't even know he said you go somewhere but yet there's a part of you that's back here just enough of you still back here that you can kind of you're in a dimensional Channel I'm here to tell you something friend that's not Star Trek or Star Wars that's Heavenly we have a positive world and a negative world and I'm here to tell you that two world are colliding and they're starting to slow down and we're starting to speed up and one of these days it's going to lift you up from here into another dimension you're not going to go past Mars in the Milky Way you're just going to step through a doorway and you're going to be suddenly in another body in another realm Hallelujah and another reality a greater reality we have a fading out of this one and a going into the other one and it's underway it's underway where we are today in the word and in Prophecy we didn't get here by accident and we're not going to continue here you can't stay here you don't want to stay here because here is going to Ash and cender and I don't want to do that I want to keep going we were showing you how in film photography you have negatives and positives and the reason that we use film photography is because that's what brother bandam was talking about you can even go and he talks about focusing the camera lens and you remember I think last time we read about people who who they don't they don't have their camera lens focused enough they're looking at the word but they don't have it focused and he said they see three and four Gods he said you're you're you're too far back there in the Reformation come on up here Focus keep focusing I promise you it'll bring them all into one It Go and you'll see it you say wow he really is just one see you say well what well then well then doesn't the Holy Spirit and and Jesus the human make him three well I if you think that's a twister how about this you're part of his godhead now does that make him four and every one of us and you're making him five and you're making him six and you're making him seven it's all one it's just God by expression this is another way that he's everywhere at once because he fills all time space and Eternity his word created everything that is out of nothing so all nature that's why the Earth can't be annihilated oh thank God for a Kentucky hillbilly that's why the world can't be annihilated because it's an eternal attribute of God so when we look at why are negatives negative the thing that makes a a when you're talking about a on paper now we're not talking about the digital world uh there's quite a Renaissance of going back to film by professional photographers I said that last time and it it literally means that negatives are negatives because they have inverted colors and tones and the negative film and you and I had to this is sourced from Kodak their website and Britannica also just in case you're wondering where the source is and so we find that that in the negative film the colors and tones are inverted to the actual scene see and in fact is this means that light areas in the original scene appear dark on the negative and dark areas appear light so so basically what it's saying is is that is that every thing is inverted and and I and now now apply that to you like brother Brandon was doing and I can see myself because my whole life's inverted and and the the light areas that were supposed to be that are light in the vision of God might look dark in me but I'm only a negative he's changing me into a positive and then I'm going to look exactly like the vision that he had in his mind they put them under light you have to put it under light they put it that's what causes light to strike that that film and that creates a negative then then a chemical process it's a process it keeps going he's still working on me I'm in a process what's happening to you why aren't you like the world because I'm in a I'm in a I'm in a dark room but I'm being processed into a new image and when I come out I'll look like I'm supposed to that's why when he said I'll meet you in there and brother R says why is because it'll it won't be a public show and people were going inside and and they had maimed and problems and this and they came out perfectly whole and normal and they said what happened to you in there and they said I don't know I can't explain it but I got a whole new body hallelu Hallelujah friends so the term negative comes from the fact that the image is the opposite of what the final photograph will look like thanks be to God so if you are disappointed in me could I please say to you that I'm the opposite of what I will be someday amen one of these days I'm going to be positive and you know who you know who'll be the happiest person in the world not sister Debbie the happiest person in the world would be me when I look in that mirror and go yeah you finally got here hallelujah oh I want to I I I want to you know brother Brandon talks about how that I'm glad a prophet could know the first thought that'll go through my mind well hey if a prophet could know what Satan thought in his heart and he said Isaiah busted him totally outed him to the whole world you've said in your heart I will Ascend be like God don't say that I'm going to write it in a book I'm GNA send it to the whole world you said in your heart I will Ascend above the Stars thanks for that I happen to be one of those stars and I got news for you that's not going to work Hallelujah I got news for the devil plan all you want but that's not going to happen I'm going to be back there one of these days when morning Stars sang together and sons of God shouted for Joy it's affecting my life even now causes me to love him causes me to want to serve him it causes me to think outside the box it causes me to know that this life is not about this life it's about the next one Hallelujah so to create a positive image the negative is projected on the photographic paper in a dark room this paper is then exposed to light the paper's then developed in another chemical bath which results in a positive image so I'm getting a word bath so of the finished photographs are called positives because they accurately depict the colors and tones of the original scene blessed be the name of the Lord unlike negatives which is an inverted representation I understand me so much better I I and you know who you know what else I understand I understand better than ever the devil's a liar and that guy is just a straight liar in fact is the diaglot the Greek diaglot says that when Satan speaketh a lie he speaks his native language speaking his native language lying is Jesus identified people that were of their father the devil he said he was a liar from the beginning he was a murder from the beginning you're doing the same thing see but we be of Abraham we can prove it we've got the family tree we've got the we've got the family record Jesus didn't even deny that he didn't deny their their genes their family record that they could go all the way back to Abraham but he said I that's just a negative that it someday you'll understand he said one day I looked up and realized I'm actually not the son of Charles and Ella Bram see that's why we were saying last time David could have looked up and said I'm actually not the son of Jesse and the and the sevs I I'm I'm actually I I I'm glad for Ruth and Boaz but they're actually not my great grandparents I came from God see so so we we we find that it's it's it's beautiful I don't just want to keep staying on the scientific site of that I think you get my point so but but but to conclude negatives are called such because they represent an inverted version of the final image with reverse colors and tones finished photographs are called positives because they display the true to life colors and tones of the original scene so so when brother Brandon would talk about Shadow see then he' he immediately would switch and say you know like a negative see all right so when we look at it this way way we realize that this in that that your life as a Believer now I know you were born I I know the hospital I was born at I know the city I've got a birth certificate I've got the testimony of sister Jean I was actually born on a Sunday on August the 4th at about 700 am so I said wow the Lord had me born on the day because he knew this would be my job amen I told my family today I said for my birthday I get to go to work and take all my family it's actually sister Debbie said you ought to tell him that so I put it in there but understand friends that your life is more than that young people your life is more than that it actually involves moving from a state of being obscure and negative to one that is clear and positive and and that happens because you've been exposed to God's light you've been explo exposed to transformative power the power of transformation that's not a that's not a figment of imagination that's not a slick title William brandom came up with Paul said be not conformed to this world cuz you can be but be transformed by the renewing of your mind he's basically saying stop living for here you do live here but stop living for here and start living before you're there for there amen while you're living here stop living for here before before you get there start living for there see so there's a direct analogy between even film processing and spiritual transformation in the New Birth so you know it's a it's a a meaningful regeneration of your life that's what Jesus asked them can you go with me we want to sit on your left and right can you go with me through the Regeneration can you suffer the things I'll suffer hey Lord we can do it well you will more than you know but what you're asking is not even mine to give see so it it gives us a meaningful regeneration of our life and and and that means that the Holy Ghost par parallels in many ways all not just photography but all kinds of Science and in fact as I I was I was looking at some of the things you know I I was doing a search the other day on an llm and and I just I just popped in there this is what William brandham believed and it sound it sounds to the most modern theologians like this guy has just lost his marbles this is some of the stuff that they say he went off the deep end on and I said does this does this kind of a thing appear in scientific theory and it was like absolutely absolutely yes it appears in string steer appears in this relativity appears in this appears in appears in in in membrane Theory appears and all of these things and actually the things that brother Brandon was saying in the 1960s science is just now understanding they only understood chaos in the 70s they're just now coming along with string theory they're just now understanding some of these things and we've preached on them before God is the greatest scientist scien is just they just broke into his laboratory he turned his back and left the door unlocked and yo y'all hurry up you know and let them get a little bit just enough power without his character to become satanic and Destroy themselves I'm here to tell you there's a master mind running this thing you can relax Shalom today friend Shalom there's a master mind controlling it all he's controlling them he's controlling this he's controlling you he's controlling here He's Got The Whole World in His Hands it's the love of God that brings Clarity and life where where we lived once in darkness and and obscurity brother brandham says in the handwriting on the wall now I'm going to turn a corner I've only been going about 40 minutes so give me give me my last 15 to 20 minutes so brother Ram says in the handwriting on the wall these are the ones I didn't put on the screen he says I want you to notice the beginning of the Gentiles when God dealt with them they got hoty in their heart and forced every man to worship the image of a holy man this is from 1956 one year before the nation would turn its back on God for the last time and a leodan messenger prior to Malachi 4 being being being in play is now is now trying to straighten them out he certainly what's in play is revelation 3:22 he's a messenger see he's a messenger to the to the age and so he was born a prophet he was always a Prophet so it doesn't matter what year the quote comes from so when what year did he say it in the year he was a prophet Enough Said So he says I want you to notice they got huy now watch this is the beginning of the Gentiles that's important when God dealt with them they got hoty in their heart and forced every man to worship the image of a holy man and the Gentile age was issued in with that now see he's back there under Nimrod coming out of the flood on the other side of the flood remember in Shiner they build a tower all right so he says that's how it came in that was the burgeoning of Gentiles around the world came from the sons of hamf sham and japheth so he says it came in that way it will go out the same it will go out in the same way the same way a boycott the mark of the beast that's what Nimrod did if you haven't read hislop's Two Babylons it is a fascinating read tremendous book really makes it connects all the dots and and and explains everything and so so he goes on to say they will force people now he's talking he said this is started it's going to end the same way came in under a force it's going to go out the Gentiles out under a force it's uh they will force people to worship and to do things that they've been taught that was contrary to the word of God and brother it'll be so slick and Sly it will deceive the very elect if possible so you better purpose in your heart tonight to be and be filled with Theo with God's holy spirit that you'll be able to discern the right and wrong thing when the proclamation is issued he comes later at the end of 1956 in December says in the message titled Abraham now Abraham was just an ordinary man that come down with his father perhaps his father might have been an idolator because they came from Babylon and that first Babylon was called the gate to heaven and next was called confusion because of nimrod and this might hurt just a little bit he says he says I'm going to say it did you notice Nimrod was the first man to begin organization that's right and the first ones this side of Calvary was the Catholic Church still Babylon carrying on Babylon appears in the first of the Bible the middle of the Bible and the last of the Bible and every cult and everything that we have today if you watch the nature of it and go back in history of HPS to Babylons and many things back there and watch each one of those seeds was planted in Genesis Genesis is the beginning it's the seed book of the Bible watch these Cults today how many how they move and how they act and go right back in Genesis and find out if it didn't start right off that same way and now now we're in Harvest Time Of Everything 1958 the Oneness of unity now in the Tower of Babylon if you'll notice that Tower it was the beginning Babylon which I will speak on a little later this week the Lord willing the Lord will Babylon the very city was patterned out of heaven and in there they had the river Euphrates flowing right by the throne in the garden swinging uh swinging garden and that's patterned off of Heaven for the for the River of Life flows by The Throne of God and you see the achievement that man was doing was making a pattern perver verted see and so God comes down and he confounds them confounds their language confound their speech they were not only just of the same dialect but they were actually in one mind and one Accord that's why the Old Testament uses two separate Hebrew words they were of the same speech and of the same language which one was the same dialect and the other one was the same purpose they had one goal one heart they were in one mind and one Accord in a fallen condition and and now God is going to come down and use a tactic that appears to be out of Satan's Playbook he's going to be put confusion on them and break that power of their faith which God said they've begun to do this and now nothing can be restrained they've broken into a secret I got a sin confusion now the devil saw that and said okay I'll use that in in the future but when it came into an open into an upper room God returned that back to his people they were in one mind and one Accord and now the Holy Spirit came down and now they became a direct extension of almighty God back in the earth and and God was now in flesh again walking the Earth see so if so if then that was lost in the Dark Ages and God has restored it back in this hour when did he do it right when the cycle is about to finish and the same way the Gentiles came in that's the same way they're going out and it's forcing the whole world to worship it and it's it's it's it's ostracizing you if you don't agree with its nonsensical thinking on both sides of the aisle I'm neither one of those I'm a Christian I'm a Son of God and I realize I'm coming to a climax and the word is coming down upon me to do what lift you up into another world hallelu brother brandham says now watch God confounded them there in Genesis and brother brandham talks about that in at the in the bride he says in the leot and church age yes sir now watch I'm GNA label this for you the church is no longer now that's past history they're no longer so now he's in the past the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God meaning they used to be he winked at their ignorance and let them be even though they had false teachings they were still God's people just like Paul said you Jews that was fine you had the law and the the the animal sacrifice that was fine God winked at your ignorance he didn't you didn't know any better he didn't tell you he Christ hadn't come the lamb hadn't come you couldn't get the Holy Ghost God understood but now he requires all you Jews to come into repentance you've got to repent you've got to come to the word of your day and receive it go ahead and keep offering animal sacrifices it won't help you but we've been doing this for 1600 years same thing they say today we've got the traditions of the father going all the way back to the Reformation fine great that worked great up until a certain point but once the word came flesh again in this hour that no longer you can't find Redemption under those kinds of pro programs anymore you might find Salvation from destruction the foolish virgin are saved but they still go in the tribulation period but I'm not looking for a tribulation period why would I when Jesus already went there for me why would I go in the tribulation and be judged when I'm already judged in Christ see so they're no longer the mouthpiece of God that's pasted it it the church it is its own mouth pieace that's present and this is 1965 the end of his ministry the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God that's one it is its own mouthpiece that's two so God is turning on her turning he didn't say he's done this is 1965 said he's turning on her so now you've got a cycle unfolding he will will this is forward confound her just like God did in Genesis he will confound her through the prophet and the bride now the prophet has already did his work what's left where's the Book of Life the bride ate that book The Book of Life is in her see for the voice of God will be in her see there it is in the future so so he he says yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come so so a real time parallel will be in effect God is changing and transitioning he's getting a we say well are are we not completely perfected we are in Christ but if we had finished all of our assignments we'd already be gone and since you're not gone the world can't be destroyed so God must still be finding other people even outside of the message of the hour so that even if they go through the tribulation they won't take the mark of the beast he's got this so figured out oh my goodness he's got this is so figured out he's brilliant he's brilliant God is a genius of all Geniuses a rest little bride rest all is well and he's changing me he's transitioning me the bride is has been becoming his final voice for all of these decades and he says once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated in in the as in the first age so I'm here to tell you friends the repudiation is right when the voice of God is the clearest and we've never had a time when the message and the bride are being so repudiated like they were in the early church and I just say blessed be the name of the Lord fill up the cup of iniquity please go ahead do it as fast as you can I'd very much like to be in a final transition I'd very much like to go from negative to positive and I don't ever have to come back to this negative again Hallelujah see when brother Brandon was saying this at the end of 1965 we were still decades away well really we were even more than half a century away but no one knew that see I'm here to tell you friends can I say it to you this way I hope you'll believe me I me I'm here to tell you we're not still decades away I'm here to tell you we're not decades away anymore I don't even know how to explain the level of blindness for anyone who can't see that we have arrived at the climax of human history the world's insanity and I and and I've been continuing to finish my audio book uh by the I played you an excerpt of it here and never has it been more clear to me when she's interviewing all of these Admirals and secretaries of defense and these men who are now in their old age and there and she's got direct quotes from them from the 70s 80s 90s 2000s the teens all the way up to now and she's still she's the only one Annie Jacobs Jacobson she's the only one they'll talk to and tell her all of these secrets because they know they can trust her they know she won't out them till it's safe to do so and she and and I'm at a point now where all she's basically doing is reading direct quotes from these people and I said to my wife I was listening going down the road the other day and I turned off I said sweetheart I said I see more clearly than I ever have before why brother brandham said it'll only take one madman you don't realize how the world is hanging by a hair's thread to nuclear Annihilation and you don't see it cuz life just goes on and wall Street's still working and they're still running an election and they still got this going on and there's Wars over here and this is happening but let me tell you something friends bring your head up out of the sand look around you the world is falling apart it's only going to take one mad man and they've got plenty of Mad Men they're all over the world and it only takes one and the world's covered with them and you've got mad men saying they're going to annihilate Israel and Israel Israel is a nuclear power and these people are how's that going to work for you you're going to annihilate them really you think they're going to you're going to annihilate them and then you're not going to get annihilated then when that happens friends I don't even know how it's going to all unfold I know that I'll be at a table thousands of miles long Hallelujah but we have arrived the climax of human history all things are ready now the Earth is poised for self Annihilation like never ever before and the bride is being repudiated and we're not decades we're not decades away I want you to know it's happening right now it's happening in real time it's happening we're not decades away we're not I don't even believe we're years away I believe that right now we could see a news headline by tomorrow of these things moving into motion and we already know that can't go to Annihilation so long as we're here going to read you this final quote before I close so brother brandham says in the future home this is where we've been studying the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride and he says see you become a new person not just an old one patched up by joining church or trying to turn a new page but you are a complete brand new unit if I call up Chris and say Chris I need a new AC I need I need a M's put I need a brand new unit he's not going to come out and rebuild mine and say Dad I gave you a brand new unit he's going to remove the old one and set a brand new one in its place and so brother R says you are a brand new unit you're not an old one patched up God takes the old man and burns him completely out with the Holy Ghost and Fire and comes himself sends down your representation I almost had a Runway just thinking about that he sent down my representation he sent down something that was kin to me he sent down the Holy Spirit and I so happened that the real me that lives on the inside is part of that Hallelujah he says he sends down your representation no man can come to me he's quoting Jesus in Luke 4 no or I mean Luke nine I think no man can come to me except my father has draw him and all the father has given me will come to me you see it same plan same way Satan was watch this now friends you want to you want a jubilee watch Satan will be taken from the Earth just exactly like Satan was taken from you Satan cannot bother he can tempt but he cannot get a born- again Christian for God from the foundation of the world forsaw him and sent Jesus to redeem him and the blood speaks for him how can he sin when it can't be seen even by God the only thing he hears is your voice he sees your representation amen that is true by the same means for the world is watch this now I'm on I'm on the last little paragraph I'm going to make these closing statements for the world is one of his attributes just the same as you are one of his attributes this is why you're considered in Redemption this is why you are more than just saved from destruction this is why you believe the word this is why why you have the Holy Ghost you're entitled to it see so he says for the world is one of his attributes just the same as you are one of his attributes the world becomes one of his attributes because it was God's thinking in the beginning to have a world to be on a throne to be a king to be a redeemer to be a healer j s s that's his attributes so why do I believe in a redeemer and a Healer and a king and a kingdom because those are part of his attributes and I'm part of his attributes Hallelujah to believe that he's a Healer and a king is native to me I say Amen to the word I'm speaking my native language Hallelujah friends it's not a simulation I'm not living in a dream I'm being blended into another world Hallelujah and it's happening right now it's happening right now Hallelujah like Simeon I found the Christ
