[music] Is that your heart's desire? Amen. To be a sanctuary. You know the uh the the the brother Brandham said that man was created to be the dwelling place. God said what house will you build me? Where is the place of my rest? And God didn't choose temples made with hands. We [music] love churches. We love a warm building we can gather in. But actually the temple of God is in your heart. How many just want to say Lord feel welcome right here. Amen. Let me make you amen. A place make room for you. Well, we're so glad to be here tonight in the house of the Lord. So honored uh to have brother Alex Mgalis with us. Amen. Brother Alex attends Brother [music] Wayne Lawson's church there in uh cold Ohio. This ain't cold, y'all. I'm just going to go and tell you right now. Um they got there's there's uh they got quite a bit colder weather there. So we won't [music] complain about uh what we call cold around here. But I just want to feel the warmth of the Holy Spirit. Tell you what, we live in a bitter cold world. Amen. The world is cold and it's [music] getting colder. Lord, I'm glad we got a place we can go to. Amen. To feel the warmth of the Holy Spirit. We want Brother [music] Alex to just have his complete liberty. Let the Holy Spirit have his liberty tonight. How many want that? Amen. You know that the prophet taught us we control, we [music] operate the gift that God places in a person's life. How many knows Brother Brandon said that? &gt;&gt; And so we we really control the outcome of what we get or we don't get [music] out of church, out of this sermon. Amen. I I I'm positive our brother has prepared [music] himself and laid before the Lord and asked God to give him something that would be specific, would be in season, [music] amen, would be in time, amen, for your need. So, we just want to Amen. make our [music] brother feel welcome, but more than that, make the Holy Spirit feel welcome. Let's sing it one more time as we invite our brother Alex [music] to come. Lord, prepare. Could you raise your hands as you sing it now? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; to be a sanctuary, pure and [music and singing] holy, tried [singing] and true, [music] with with thanksgiving, with [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; sanctuary [music] for I wonder could we [music] just do that one more time tonight? Let's sing it once more. Oh Lord, [music] prepare [singing] me to be a sanctuary. [music] Pure and holy, [music] tried and true, and with [music] thanksgiving I'll be [singing] unliving [music] sanctuary. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; for you. [music] Amen. I believe that's the key tonight. Amen. We uh we we always look forward to having a visitation from the Lord, but I want to be a habitation. Amen. I don't just want him to come and go in my life and come and do a few things and leave, but I want him to have a residence. Amen. Is that is that your desire tonight? Well, I believe that's that's the Christian life. Amen. So we just thank God for his unfailing presence. We don't have to fear to go anywhere or do anything because that unfailing presence of the Lord Jesus Christ is always with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh I trust you brought your lick of fire tonight. We just want to greet you on behalf of the church in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's good to see so many different familiar faces. If I start taking time to talk to individuals, uh well I don't know how much time I have but probably not that much time. So but you all know who you are. God bless different ones. It is really terribly good to see the Crossman family tonight especially. Haven't seen them in a while. So, we just appreciate so many different uh familiar faces as I said. So, um we'll try not to prolong the time too much tonight. I just invite you to turn with me this evening into the book of St. Matthew and we're going to look in the second chapter tonight. And um I pray that uh you know, you're talking about Ohio being cold. That's that's true. Um, you know, I used to feel like a real big shot because where I'm going back a single digit. And now I just the older I get to realize I feel kind of foolish about the whole thing. Why? Why didn't I just move? You know, you know, when you're young, you I'm tough. I can handle anything. Man, that's that's that's for young foolish people. I don't got nothing to prove anymore. I like being warm. So So God bless you. You're you're blessed to be here where it's not below freezing tonight. So I hope I take that fire back with me because I'm going to need it. All right. Well, Matthew chapter 2, we're just going to read the first 18 verses here, and we'll have a word of prayer after that. The scripture says this. Now, when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him?" When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. So, this got around pretty quick. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet," it's in the book of Micah, by the way, "and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah. For out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel." Then Herod, when he had privy called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child. And when ye have found him, bring me word again that I may come and worship him also." Spoilers, he wasn't going to go worship him. That wasn't actually what he was about. [laughter] [gasps] And when he had heard when they had heard the king, they departed. I like this part here. And lo, the star which they saw on the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down and worshiped him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts, gold, and frankincense and myrr. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appearth to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word. For Herod will seek the young child to destroy him." When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt have I called my son." Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet. I want you to notice how many times the scriptur is telling you, thus it was fulfilled. I'm going to come back this, but scripture after scripture is being fulfilled in what we would look at as a tragedy. &gt;&gt; But yet, God has ordained this for a purpose. Notice in Rama, there was a voice heard, lamentation and weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not. I just invite you to bow your heads with me for a word of prayer here as we look unto the author now. Our heavenly father, we have read this word which has been preserved for us. Lord, it's more than just a a historical document to us tonight, but we're aware that the author of these words is in this place tonight. We've come into a divine audience. And Lord, as we bow our heads, we just ask now that you'd come and take these words and speak to the needs and the hearts of these your children. Lord, come and do and speak that which only you can do. May it be a blessing. May it be a help to your children as they're here, as our brother said, in this dark, cold world. We're so grateful to have a fire, not a painted fire, but a fire that gives warmth and light and revelation and strength to the hearts of your children tonight. Lord, help me as a man to move completely out of the way now. And may all these things that are done for the help of these your children, may you receive unto yourself great glory and honor and praise for all these things. for we commit it to you now in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And the bride says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. You may be seated this evening. I'd like to take this thought uh why it had to be Magi. Of course, Brother Be takes many different types of uh sermons throughout the the Christmas season. I guess I'll just call it what it is, but I don't know where we're at with that. So, I'm just going to go ahead and go here. But [laughter] but during this time of the year that happens once a year as it's apt to happen, he takes several different thoughts on it. And uh he preaches, you know, brother Bam talks about why little Bethlehem and and brother Bam goes into great lengths to talk about why God chose Bethlehem as the birthplace of Christ as the scripture fortell. He he does it for several different reasons. Brother Bam talks about you know the name Bethlehem talking about the house of bread or the house of God's bread. It speaks of its purpose and of God's purpose because Christ of course he's the true bread that descends out of heaven. Amen. Of course, him being the son of David also by ancestry. David hails back to Bethlehem. And and God I I I love this. You know, God is showing his humility to have Jesus come in such a lowly and a humble manner. Amen. Uh men would have thought perhaps that Messiah should come in a more dignified manner. Amen. He need to have him in a nice bright place. I'm going to take this off now. You know, like I'm in Ohio, I guess, but it's not quite that hot either. Praise Man, that was really thoughtful. Thank you, man. It's harder to get out of the older I get for some reason. Anyway, you're not here to hear about that tonight. But, uh, it's talking about the humility of it. Amen. Men would have thought perhaps Messiah should have come from a more dignified manner or a greater pomp. But, it what's interesting, God has no such need. Amen. God doesn't need the the biggest palace or what we think is impressive. Amen. because the glory of God is not found in those kind of circumstances or those settings. So, uh for for God, what is a manger and he different from a palace? Amen. So God, he he shows us and we you know the scripture testifies that we know that the foolishness of God is greater than the wisdom of men. Amen. But I believe it's evident when we look at this, if you really consider it in choosing such a setting, we see the very wisdom of God. We know God's revealed in simplicity, but he's also hidden in simplicity. Is that right? You say, "What do you mean by that?" Well, the Bible tells us it was the wisdom of God to to do it the way that he did it. Amen. In other words, he brings Christ into this world in a manger. And it's a setting that the ambitious and the powerful are absent. The Bible tells if the princes of this world had known, they would have crucified him. And they would they would have not crucified him, rather. Amen. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO FULFILL this purpose. AND SO GOD HIDES things from the wise and the prudent. But there's a an elected group of people that he reveals him to. Amen. And so GOD CHOOSES TO TO PLACE CHRIST NOT IN A PLACE OF POLITICS or of men's ambition or seats of authority, but in a manger. Amen. He He He's keeping him FROM A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN the word. Amen. Can I say it this way? They would have taken the message, taken what God was doing and used it for their own agenda. they would have made a puppet out of it or or orchestrated some sort of man-made attachment to it. SO SO GOD HIDES HIM IN THIS PLACE. AND GOD DOESN'T just hide things to be cute or to be difficult, BUT HE'S GOT A PURPOSE in it. Like we said, he's doing it to HIDE IT FROM THE EYES of the wise and the prudent. AMEN. I I REMEMBER FOR MYSELF WHEN I WHEN I first heard about the message, God led me to this place and I heard about the message. And I don't know for each of you what your experience was, but I heard ABOUT THE MESSAGE AND I'M THINKING, WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS? THIS OUGHT TO BE ALL AROUND THE WORLD. EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW WHAT THIS MESSAGE IS ABOUT. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO SOUTH AFRICA. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO INDIA. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO INDIANA. AND THEY SHOULD EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW WHO WILLIAM BRANDON IS. WHY DON'T THEY KNOW? EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW. AMEN. And it struck me AS A YOUNG [screaming] MAN, WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE KNOW? BUT WE HAVE OUR ANSWER. AMEN. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO GOOGLE WILLIAM Brandom &gt;&gt; and you'll have YOUR ANSWER FOR WHY NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT. GOD HID IT FROM A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE. AMEN. We look at our media today. We look at our politics today and the propaganda machines THAT WE HAVE. THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED in taking this MESSAGE AND PROMOTING IT AS THE VINDICATED WORD OF GOD. THEY'RE INTERESTED IN WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THEM MONEY. They're interested in what's going to MAKE A STORY SELL. AND THEY'VE GOT AN AGENDA attached to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're not interested in presenting it that you WOULD HAVE LIFE, BUT THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN IDEAS AND THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN PRESENTATION AND THEY'LL TAKE WHATEVER YOU GIVE THEM AND THEY'LL MANHANDLE IT. AMEN. IMAGINE THE LEVEL OF PERSECUTION IF IF IT WAS AS WIDESPREAD AND AS WIDE KNOWN AS I WAS TALKING ABOUT. IMAGINE WHAT WE WOULD BE THE scrutiny we would be under tonight. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT AND WE SAY WELL WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE THIS AND WHY NOT? WHY ISN'T IT MORE VISIBLE? BUT WE UNDERSTAND YOU know it's it's like the old adage the tallest tree in the forest is the first to fall. I MEAN GOD HIDES THINGS FOR A REASON. HE HIDES IT FOR OUR GOOD. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED BECAUSE YOU'RE A LITTLE FLOCK TONIGHT. AMEN. BECAUSE IT'S THE FATHER'S GOOD PLEASURE TO GIVE YOU THE KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE DISCOURAGED THAT YOUR NAME'S NOT SOMEWHERE IN SOME MAGAZINE OR IN SOME SPOTLIGHT OR SOME MARQUEE. YOUR NAMES ARE WRITTEN DOWN IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. AND WHEN ALL THESE OTHER THINGS HAVE PASSED AWAY AND THEY'RE ALL GONE, YOU SHALL REMAIN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE the Lord. So, I'M NOT I'M NOT UPSET ABOUT IT. I I accept that it's the wisdom of God in my life. Amen. I'm not looking to promote something. I'm looking to BE A CARRIER. NOT JUST A CARRIER, BUT I AM THE LIGHT MANIFESTED. YOU'RE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD TONIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WHOEVER SEES IT, I want to represent Jesus Christ to that one. Amen. So, we look at this THAT THAT GOD IS PLACING IT SOMEWHERE AWAY FROM THE INFLUENCE and the control of money AND POLITICS. AND BROTHER TALKS ABOUT WHY IT HAD TO BE SHEPHERDS. THE SAME VERY THE THE very same kind of thing. THESE SHEPHERDS, THEY'RE THEY'RE SIMPLE MEN. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT SCHOLARS. THEY'RE NOT THEOLOGIANS. THEY'RE NOT IN SOME SORT OF ECCLESIASTICAL SYSTEM. AMEN. They're not looking to take what they found and UTILIZE IT FOR THEIR OWN ENDS TO TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN. THEY'RE SHEPHERDS. AMEN. THEY'VE GOT NO PRECONCEIVED IDEAS. They've got no agenda. They're just in a BLANK SLATE FOR GOD TO USE. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR. SOMEONE THAT'LL LAY ASIDE their own thinking, THEIR OWN IDEAS, AND ACCEPT THE WORD AS GOD REVEALS IT. AND GOD REVEALS IT TO THESE MEN. AMEN. THESE THESE SHEPHERDS, AND THEY'VE GOT THE RIGHT KIND OF A NATURE. AMEN. AS THE PROPHET SAID, LAMBS AREN'T BORN IN HOUSES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. CHRIST, THE LAMB OF GOD. IT WOULD BE SHEPHERDS TO VISIT HIM. AND THEY'RE RIGHT AT HOME IN THAT SETTING WHERE NO ONE ELSE THINKS IT'S POPULAR WHEN THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR HIM THERE, but they're right at home in THIS PLACE. AMEN. BROTHER SAID THAT THEY were the ONLY KIND THAT WOULD ACCEPT HIM. A SHEPHERD WAS THE ONLY THING WOULD ACCEPT a lamb. They know how to TAKE CARE OF IT. And so it is today when we get the lamb's message. Amen. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. WE OUGHT TO BE SO GRATEFUL TONIGHT FOR SOME REAL SHEPHERDS. THEY TAKE CARE OF THE LAMB'S MESSAGE. AMEN. LISTEN, I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME HERODS in the pulpit. I know we've had different things and and and things have come up AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE TRIED TO TAKE THIS MESSAGE AND USE IT FOR THEIR OWN. BUT DON'T LET THAT DISCOURAGE YOU FROM THE FACT THAT GOD ORDAINED A TRUE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY. AMEN. AND GOD'S GOT SOME REAL SHEPHERDS. THEY WON'T SCATTER THE FLOCK, BUT THEY'LL FEED THE PEOPLE of God. THE SAME GOD THAT TOLD JEREMIAH, "WOE BE TO THE PASTURES THAT DESTROY. THEY SCATTER THE SHEEP OF MY PASTURE WAS THE SAME GOD THAT ALSO SAID, I WILL SET UP SHEPHERDS OVER THEM WHICH SHALL FEED THEM AND they sh I love this. And they shall fear NO MORE NOR BE DISMAYED, NEITHER SHALL THEY BE LACKING." AMEN. You're blessed tonight TO HAVE A PASTOR. YOU'RE BLESSED TONIGHT TO HAVE MINISTRIES. And listen, I KNOW YOU don't ever have trouble here. &gt;&gt; I know there's never any DISAGREEMENTS HERE. LISTEN, YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE EVERY DECISIONS THAT'S EVER MADE AND YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THE COLOR OR SOMETHING AND YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE EVERYTHING THAT SOMEBODY SAYS, BUT THANK GOD TONIGHT FOR GOD ORAINED SHEPHERDS, A GOD ORAINED PASTOR THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEAR. AMEN. YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE EVERYTHING, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEAR THAT HE'S FEEDING YOU SOME POISON TONIGHT OR GIVING YOU SOME DENOMINATIONAL THEORY. HE'S FED YOU WITH THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE COMING TO GIVE YOU THE WORD OF GOD. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE DISMAYED AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEAR. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE YOUR MEAL COME FROM. &gt;&gt; WELL, I NEED TO LOOK UP ON THIS PACKAGING WHERE THIS IS MANUFACTURED AND WHERE IT WAS PACKAGED. YOU KNOW WHERE IT COME OUT OF. IT COMES STRAIGHT OUT OF HEAVEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT COME FROM A VINDICATED THUS SAYETH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord for that tonight. Well, glory to God. Listen, there's a blessing in that. Amen. If you have respect for that, there's a blessing in that. You believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; God's got an ordained way of doing things. If you if you'll honor God's way of doing things, there's a blessing for you there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we're looking at this tonight, but what about these wise men? Why them? And I I like this. You know, Brother Bram had the same question. He talks about in great shining light. These these wise men, these magi, THESE ARE THESE ARE PERSIAN MEN. &gt;&gt; They're not Israelites. THEY'RE NOT ANYBODY THAT WE WOULD THINK IS SPECIAL. AND SO, WHY IS THIS THAT THAT GOD WOULD USE THESE MEN? And you know, now I'll just say this, if I could qualify this for a moment. I'm perfectly content to accept what brother Bam says about it and just take that at face value about these wise men. That's all right. But I I thought, you know, for myself, I thought it might be appropriate to look in the histories a little bit and go through this and what what does the history say about these wise men and see if it lines up and with what brother Bam says and things like that. And when you look at what Brother Bam says about it, it leads me to believe that he was acquainted with some of these writings. Now, I'm saying this for this reason. Contrary to some people's thinking, Brother Ben did in fact read books. And that doesn't bother me. And maybe it bothers you. I don't know why it would. BUT BROTHER BEN READ BOOKS. AMEN. Is that okay? If you read books, that doesn't make you a nerd. It makes you literate. [laughter] Well, I I mean, SERIOUSLY, WE'VE GOT THE SCRIPTURES. We got the message. AND LISTEN, I I don't think you need anything BESIDES THAT. I BELIEVE EVERYTHING we need, it's been given to us. Amen. But you know, SOME PEOPLE THEY ALMOST BECOME DOGMATIC ABOUT IT. Like if you pick up a brochure at a gas station and you read it, you're a backsliding heathen double pagan LIKE DON'T BE READING THAT NOW. WHAT YOU READING FOR? And I'm thinking cuz that's what that's how you find stuff out. Amen. Well, praise the Lord. LISTEN, BROTHER BAM TALKED ABOUT ONE TIME HE WAS IN NEW YORK and he listened TO A LECTURE FROM ALBERT EINSTEIN. NOW, I'M NOT GOING TO ASK FOR A SHOW OF HANDS TONIGHT. AMEN. But if you sit there and say, "Well, listen, you don't need to BE DOING THAT." WELL, YOU'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND CORRECT THE PROPHET. [snorts] Praise the Lord. Somebody say, "Well, Brother Bam said, "Educations of the devil." And people, THEY WENT OUT on a limb with that where if you go to school, if you know how to SIGN YOUR NAME, LISTEN, BROTHER BREN, LISTEN, BROTHER BEN, WHEN HE STARTED OUT PREACHING, HE COULDN'T even read the Bible. He had to HAVE HOPE READ IT. THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM LEARNING. &gt;&gt; And people WILL ALMOST GO, "WELL, I don't know. Here we are. PEOPLE WILL ALMOST GO THE OTHER WAY LIKE, "WELL, YOU TOOK IT UPON yourself to learn some valuable skill. THEREFORE, IT'S THE DEVIL." &gt;&gt; NOW, we're laughing, but it's true. PEOPLE, THEY THEY'RE SO SPIRITUAL. THEY'RE SO MUCH SMARTER THAN YOU TILL THEY'RE NOT any smarter than you. BROTHER SAID, "I'M NOT SUPPORTING IGNORANCE." AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE'LL ALMOST MAKE IT THAT WAY. Bless God. You better not look that up or READ THAT. AMEN. LISTEN, THE WORLD HAS ENOUGH IGNORANCE IN IT TODAY. IT DOES NOT NEED US TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T NEED TO ADD OUR IGNORANCE. AMEN. PAUL SAID, "I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE IGNORANT." AMEN. WE'RE WE'RE THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW. &gt;&gt; WE'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW SOMETHING. AMEN. THAT'S NOT TO MAKE YOU ARROGANT. LISTEN, if it's just KNOWLEDGE AND IT PUFFS YOU UP, YOU'LL WALK AROUND WITH YOUR FAVORITE QUOTES AND YOU'LL CONDEMN EVERYBODY ELSE FOR NOT BEING AS SPIRITUAL AS YOU. BUT IF IT'S REAL GODLY LOVE, IT'LL EDIFY THAT PERSON AND YOU'LL TAKE THAT. LISTEN, YOUR YOUR INTELLIGENCE, IF YOU'VE GOT SOME, not claiming any for MYSELF TONIGHT. YOUR INTELLIGENCE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A HINDRANCE TO GOD. IT'S ONLY IF YOU LET IT. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE YOUR EMOTION. IT'S LIKE anything else. Are you going to SUBMIT IT TO GOD OR ARE YOU GOING TO LET it rule over you? &gt;&gt; Well, now that's that's my rant for tonight, I guess. &gt;&gt; Listen, BROTHER SAID THESE MAGI, HE SAID THEY WERE SCIENTIFIC MEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. SCIENTIFIC MEN THAT WERE STUDYING this thing. Brother says this, I was thinking this comes to mind about these magi and the star. AND WHAT STRUCK ME WAS WHAT DOES A MAGI HAVE TO DO WITH CHRIST? THEREFORE, BY READING many of the ancient scholars last night late and he had a late night, too. &gt;&gt; So, here he's reading the ancient scholars. Sounds kind of dignified actually. Brother Brandon was pouring over the [laughter and gasps] the the books of the ancients, BUT HE'S READING THESE ANCIENT SCHOLARS late last night till I went to sleep AT THE DESK TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD BRING A LITTLE light on the subject for today. So, and brother mentions Hampton is one of these these these different ones. So, I look through I if anybody cares, I'm not going to give you all the quotes because that's a whole another I'll put you all to sleep a little too early. But Josephus talks about not in antiquities but in his uh book of the history of the Jewish war and Tacitus and Satonius different ones they they all talk about this and what's remarkable now this is this is what's interesting to me what's remarkable is they all talk about this expectation there was an expectation on the earth AND THESE ARE PAGAN NATIONS &gt;&gt; THESE are Romans and Persians THERE'S THIS EXPECTATION OF THEM THAT SOME great ruler is going to appear upon the earth. Amen. in the culture that day was Roman, but before it was Roman, it was the Greeks. Before it was the Greeks, it was the Mes and Persians. They had influence in the area in in that whole area and it had it had carried over. Amen. And and UNDER THE PERSIANS, IT WAS THIS IDEA that had taken hold. AND WE KNOW WHY. A PROPHET TELLS US WHY. BECAUSE there was a man by the name OF DANIEL THAT WAS IN Babylon one day and then later the Mes and the Persians. AND HE'D RECEIVED A WORD FROM THE LORD THAT GOD'S PEOPLE, THEY'VE BEEN IN CAPTIVITY 70 YEARS, BUT NOW 70 WEEKS have been determined upon the people. And and Daniel, he he goes into this. And of course, we know the scripture of it. I'm not going to preach it all to you tonight, but you're you're familiar with it. AMEN. AND SO THESE MEN, THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS, and people knew about this. IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T LOOKING FOR IT WAS THE JEWS. THE VERY PEOPLE IT WAS ORDAINED TO GO to [screaming] was the VERY PEOPLE THAT SEEMED IGNORANT OF IT. THEY LISTEN THEY HAD SCRIPTURES ABOUT WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO and where he would come from AND WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW TIMES GOD TALKS ABOUT WHEN THAT IN THE MIDST of the 70th week he's GOING TO BE CUT OFF THAT the beginning this prince is GOING TO APPEAR AND EVERYBODY there's this uh the the historians talk about this this star THEY CALL A A CELESTIAL ORACLE. THIS LIGHT IN the sky appears and they see this and they document and they TALK ABOUT IT. NOW, HERE'S WHAT'S FUNNY. THEY'VE ALL GOT different interpretations. They think it's going to be this Roman emperor. They think it's going to BE THIS. THEY THEY ALL SAW SOMETHING, but they all interpreted it differently. BUT PRAISE GOD, WE HAVE THE DIVINE COMMENTARY TONIGHT. I DON'T NEED WHAT JOSEPHUS SAYS ABOUT IT. I KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT. AMEN. WE KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT. MATTHEW WROTE IT DOWN. WE WE UNDERSTAND a ruler did arise. Amen. [laughter] A scepter WAS TO RISE OUT OF SHILOH. AND THESE MAGI, THEY'RE AWARE OF THE DIVINE PURPOSE BECAUSE THEY HAD THE WORDS of Daniel. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S NOTEWORTHY. THEY'VE GOT ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT SAYS WHEN HE'S GOING TO COME. &gt;&gt; NOW, you see where I'm going? Probably not a little bit. AMEN. THEY WEREN'T JUST LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE DAY and the time and they recognized their hour. &gt;&gt; They recognized the day they were living in. AND THAT'S WHY BROTHER BAM SAYS THAT'S WHY THEY SAW IT BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR it in the first place. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. NOW YOU THINK ABOUT THESE GUYS. IMAGINE THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT. IMAGINE. CAN I DRAMATIZE THIS? I'M NOT USING an anacronism. I'm just GOING TO DRAMA. IMAGINE THESE GUYS. THEY COME IN THERE. THEY MEET UP. THEY HIGH-FIVE EACH OTHER. AND THEY WALK INTO JERUSALEM AND THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOWN. THEY GET TO THE PALACE. THEY GO UP TO HEROD AND THEY'VE GOT THEIR STREAMERS OUT AND THEIR PARTY HATS ON AND THEY'RE THEY'RE WAVING FLAGS. WE FINALLY MADE IT. IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS. WHEN WE MADE IT AND THEY KNOCK ON THE DOORS, HEY GUYS, WE'RE HERE. WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS HE THAT'S BORN KING OF THE JEWS? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND. &gt;&gt; And they're like, did did I stutter or is this Maybe I need to practice my Hebrew a little bit. Where is he THAT IS BORN IS YOUR KING. WE DON'T HAVE what I don't know what you're talking about. [laughter] And these these guys like we don't know what you're talking about. And they're like, well, I don't know why you don't know what I'm talking about. IT'S YOUR KING. IT'S YOUR PROPHECY. IT'S YOUR MESSIAH. AND THE BIBLE SAYS THESE GUYS ARE TROUBLED. AND PROBABLY THE MAGIC WERE TROUBLED THAT THEY WERE TROUBLED. LIKE, HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? YOU WERE HERE WHEN IT HAPPENED AND YOU MISSED IT. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, just think ABOUT THIS. OUT SOMEWHERE IN A MANGER TWO YEARS PRIOR, A HEAVENLY HOST SPOKE TO A BUNCH OF SHEPHERDS THAT MESSIAH HAD BEEN BORN. BEHOLD, I BRING YOU TIDINGS OF GREAT JOY. AND ALL THIS IS GOING ON. AND THESE GUYS HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS [screaming] OF MILES AWAY, THEY SEE A STAR AND THEY TAKE OFF. AND ALL THE TIME THE CHURCH HAD NO IDEA. [cheering] &gt;&gt; They're looking around. I don't know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; Well, let's go OPEN A BIBLE AND find out. Well, maybe you should have opened it beforehand. &gt;&gt; Well, glory. It's like my wife says, you know, you get people and they get critical, they get hurt, and they they they get hurt. They get whatever. They get confused. They hear certain things and they they begin to study the message and they're looking for faults. If they' have studied it when they were aiming towards believing it, they might not disbelieve it. Amen. THEY WAIT TILL THEY GET ALL HURT AND DISCOURAGED AND CONFUSED. WELL, NOW MAYBE WE BETTER LOOK THIS UP. &gt;&gt; THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONES LOOKING. THEY SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED IT. AND YET GOD DIDN'T EVEN DEAL WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; THEY GET TO JERUSALEM is lights out. &gt;&gt; THEY'D FOLLOWED THAT FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES. BUT THE DARKNESS OF ECCLESIASTICAL DENOMINATIONALISM OVER JERUSALEM WAS SO GREAT THAT GOD SAID, "WE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO NEXT." COULD you tell us WHERE TO GO? WELL, WE'VE got some HISTORICAL IDEAS. WE'VE GOT SOME DOCTRINE. WE KNOW WHERE HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TWO YEARS AGO. WE CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU WHERE HE IS TODAY. HEY, MAYBE YOU CAN FIND HIM FOR US. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. MAYBE YOU COULD TELL ME WHERE HE'S AT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S AT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE CHURCH WORLD SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE MESSAGE, SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED ELIJAH. BEHOLD, I SEND YOU ELIJAH. THEY SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED IT. YET, THEY WERE [screaming] THE VERY ONES THAT MISSED IT. THEY REJECTED IT. THEY SLAYED IT. THEY MURDERED IT. THEY SAID EVERY KIND OF DIRTY THING ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, the party hats come off. &gt;&gt; PUT PUT YOUR STUFF BACK AWAY. IT'S NOT TIME YET. &gt;&gt; WELL, they said go over to Bethlehem, but I love it. They get out there a little bit and the light comes again. [laughter] All they had to do was get out from that little bit of that that confusion, that Babylon, that nonsense, the historical idea. As soon as they come out, they see the star again. &gt;&gt; Oh my, praise the Lord. They get out there and you know, and brother Bam talks about this. It's it's not like our our modern nativity scene. They don't get there. He's a little baby. It was two years they traveled. Herod inquires about this. This is why later he orders the children two years in to be slayed. Amen. So they probably traveled about the space of two years. So I want this where I'm coming to with this. When they get there, Jesus is not a baby at this point. Now I don't know how far they traveled. Brother Bam said they were still in Bethlehem. So I don't have any reason to say otherwise, but there's nothing that supports the idea that he sat in a manger for two years. &gt;&gt; He's 2 years old kicking blocks AROUND IN THE EXACT SAME manger that probably would had to pay whatever for that. Like, "Hey guys, you've been here a year and a half. Could you could you help us out a little bit? We got THE END'S NOT FULL ANYMORE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT HE WASN'T WHERE HE WAS AT TWO YEARS AGO. &gt;&gt; HE WAS WHERE THE WORD said he would be. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the light led them right to wherever he was. The light led them NOT WHERE THEY TOLD THEM TO GO. BUT THE LIGHT LED him right where HE WAS AT. THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF IT. AND WHEN THEY SAW THE STAR, THEY DIDN'T SIT THERE AND MOPE AND GET SAD AND SAY, "WELL, BLESS GOD. I guess we'll find him. Oh, we've got the greatest message there's ever been. Well, praise God. Let's just fold our hands and thank God and WE'LL COME BACK. MAN, THEY REJOICE. &gt;&gt; THEY FOUND SOMETHING. AMEN. LISTEN, I GLORY TO GOD. THEY FOUND SOMETHING TO REJOICE ABOUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. They get there and they come right to where the holy child is. AND BROTHER BRANDON, like I said, he talks ABOUT THIS THING. THESE MEN IN JERUSALEM, THEY ALL MISSED IT. BROTHER SAYS THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN SEE A SIGN OF IT. &gt;&gt; AND I'M THINKING HISTORIANS WROTE ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; BUT THE JEWS, THEIR OWN OBSERVATORIES DIDN'T SEE A THING. THESE HEBREW PEOPLE. WHY? Because they weren't expecting it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See why timing is so important. It wasn't just for these these these wise men. It wasn't just that they knew it would happen. They recognized the day they were living. They recognized this was the time for it. Amen. They could know by the stars. They could discern by prophecy, by the signs of the heaven. This was the hour. Amen. [snorts] Brother says this, they know the scriptures because Daniel was their chief. You know that second chapter of Daniel tells he was made chief over them. SO HE TAUGHT THEM. NO doubt at one night they was sitting there reading the scriptures about and Daniel said that he beheld all these kingdoms till finally they become into what they was each the me of Persians and on down till they come into Rome. AND THEN FINALLY HE SAW a stone cut out of the mountain without hands. And they said it must be about that time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [panting] &gt;&gt; They remembered the rehearsal way back before that time. Way back in the days of the journey of Israel when they come up and heard Balam say when he seen Israel SAID THERE WILL ARISE A STAR OUT OF JACOB. AMEN. IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT time when they was thinking about those things that the new visitor appeared. &gt;&gt; See, there was an expectation. Amen. Now, this is this is a whole another thought. I don't want to get into it too much, but I was just talking about this here the other day. You know, it's like Moses. Moses had been out there in the wilderness for 40 years. He'd been in exile from Egypt. And one day he's out there and God, YOU KNOW, GOD, HE HAS A WAY OF GETTING your attention. &gt;&gt; Amen. God, he puts THIS BURNING BUSH UP HERE IN THIS BUSH. IT'S NOT CONSUMED. AND AND HE DOESN'T START SAYING, "HEY, MOSES, LOOK UP HERE. THERE'S A BURNING BUSH UP HERE. LOOK UP HERE, MOSES." But he just he lights it UP. AND MOSES, HE SAYS, "WHAT IS THIS SIGHT ABOUT THIS BUSH? IT'S BEING BURNED. I SEE." HE SAYS, "I WILL NOW TURN ASIDE TO SEE THIS." THE BIBLE SAYS, "AND WHEN he turned, GOD SPOKE TO HIM AND SAID, "MOSES, MOSES." SEE, GOD GOD HIDES SOME THINGS TO HIDE IT FROM SOME PEOPLE, but he also hides some things so you'll find it cuz he's looking for someone who's interested. AMEN. IT'S THE IT'S THE GLORY OF GOD TO CONCEAL A MATTER. BUT IT'S THE HONOR OF KINGS TO SEARCH IT OUT. SO GOD LEAVES A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOU. HE LEAVES A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY'LL THEY'LL SHOW AN INTEREST. AMEN. NOT JUST A CURIOSITY, BUT AN INTEREST. THESE MEN ARE NOT JUST, "HEY, LOOK, THERE'S A STAR. I BET IT'S TIME. I BET IT'S TIME. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT WHEN WE HEAR THE STORIES ABOUT, BUT THEY WERE INTERESTED IN MEETING THIS ONE." AND THEY GOT THEIR GIFTS AND THEY LISTEN, THEY TRAVELED NOT JUST A HOP, SKIPPING A JUMP. NOT LIKE ME DRIVING DOWN HERE TO SOUTH CAROLINA. THEY TRAVELED AT GREAT DISTANCE AND RISK AND PERIL TO THEIR OWN WELL-BEING, AND THEY DIDN'T COME EMPTY-HANDED. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE LUGGING THEIR GIFTS. THEY'RE BRINGING THEIR CAMELS. THEY BROUGHT THIS STUFF WITH HIM AND BROTHER BAM TALKS ABOUT THIS THING. THESE MAGI THEY [screaming] WERE INSPIRED. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, IT'S NOT JUST like me going down getting you a card saying we'll marry Dewali or whatever it is you all you know people believe. AMEN. THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING in them. THESE THESE GENTILE &gt;&gt; MAGI &gt;&gt; YET GOD INSPIRED THEM BECAUSE GOD IN SUNARY TIMES DIVERSE MANNERS HE SPAKE. AMEN. AND HE INSPIRES THESE men when they bring these gifts. Brother Bam says this. God guided those gifts because they were gifts to identify him. &gt;&gt; Brother M says in God gifts always find their places. 1963 he says now he says now what how beautiful those gifts fit into Jesus Christ. See gold speaking of his deed. He says now they wasn't heathens. That's kind of an interesting statement because uh colloquially speaking they were. But he says they wasn't heathens. THEY WERE INSPIRED BY GOD. They weren't wasn't imagining something that proves right there even the magi that they did see the supernatural because their own GIFT THAT THEY OFFERED IDENTIFIED AND SPOKE WELL OF their testimony that they did see THE SUPERNATURAL LIGHT. WHY? IT SPEAKS PERFECTLY. They brought gold deity. They brought frankincense service. They brought myrr for his death when he was a baby. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You imagine giving the baby, hey, this is for your funeral one day. &gt;&gt; But that was the purpose of his coming. And they recognized that because they were inspired. &gt;&gt; Amen. Showing that deity would be put to death in the flesh that it might redeem fallen man. Praise the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; So notice, as brother Ram would say, their gifts showed what they thought of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was it was their identification of him. But where did they come from? That thought they were inspired. It showed what they thought of him. Amen. Brother says this. I say that to us today. The thing that we bring to him &gt;&gt; identifies what our thoughts is about him. He says you understand what I mean. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says if you believe with all your heart every word of that, you'll identify it by giving all that you have to it. But if you believe it's just a good place to associate &gt;&gt; with better people &gt;&gt; around the church and things like that, that's just about what you'll give. &gt;&gt; Just a few social hours with some of the congregation or something. But if you believe it with all your heart, &gt;&gt; if you believe with all your heart, you'll give everything that's in you to it. See, it identifies you and you believe the message that you believe it to be the truth. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Now I want to come back to the question here at hand. Why does it have to be magi? Why does God take a bunch of people from outside the holy land, outside of Abraham's lineage and and all this to do this? Why? Well, we talked about at the beginning to fulfill the scripture. See, God can't fulfill these scriptures with just the Hebrew people. Amen. We read here twice in the book of Matthew. These things were done to fulfill the words of the PROPHETS BECAUSE OF THE VISITATION of these WISE MEN. THAT'S WHY Herod brings about a slaughter. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're vi it seem it seems kind of uh seems kind of morbid if you think about it. &gt;&gt; If these men had NOT VISITED IT MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED BUT BECAUSE they visit it triggers a slaughter. It triggers the the killing of these children. Amen. But why? That the words of Jeremiah might be fulfilled. Amen. Because they do this and he's seeking the Lord Jesus. HE'S SEEKING MESSIAH. IT'S because of this. The angel of the Lord comes to Joseph by night &gt;&gt; because there's a persecution coming. The angel comes to Joseph and tells him to flee into Egypt. Why? That it might be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; That was spoken to the prophets. Amen. Now, we look at it tonight. Pray for my voice here. Then we look at it tonight and these people, they don't look like what we would call likely candidates to be used of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're they're not religious. They're not theological. Amen. But yet we watch and God has used them. They're the ones looking. &gt;&gt; Where is he that's born king of the Jews? Brother Ram says this. Someone might think that those magi would not have been a privileged people to have seen this. But if you'll read the book of Acts, Peter said that he perceived that God was of no respect of person and that he would visit those or accept those receive those of any nation that feared him and worked righteousness. God is no respector of persons. He says they then someone must have wanted to see that heavenly visitor and wonder what did this mean? THEY COULD UNDERSTAND why these magi he says people today don't understand. Did you know that those magi saw the star and it passed over observatories? We don't have any history of anybody else ever seeing it. Why? They wasn't looking. &gt;&gt; I believe they saw the star. The Bible said they do. That's the reason today that people don't see the things they should see. The mysteries of God being unfolded because they're not looking for it. God only reveals himself to those who will let him and expecting him. &gt;&gt; Now, WE CAN TALK ABOUT this in the broader sense, but even in our lives, how many times do we miss what God's trying to do in our lives because we're not paying attention. YOU KNOW, THE BIBLE says that they that are the sons of God, they're led by the spirit of God. THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE JUST ARBITRARILY leads you when he feels like it. There's there's always leadership present. God is speaking TO US ALL THE TIME. THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE NOT ALWAYS LISTENING. JOB TALKS ABOUT IT. GOD WILL SPEAK TO MAN ONCE, YAY, TWICE, AND HE DOESN'T RECEIVE IT. SO GOD HAS TO COME TO HIM IN A DREAM. WE THINK, "MAN, I GOT A DREAM." WELL, PRAISE GOD FOR THE DREAM. WELL, THE DREAM'S ALL RIGHT, BUT MAYBE IT'S because you weren't LISTENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOW MANY TIMES DO WE MISS GOD SPEAKING TO US &gt;&gt; and God's trying to show US STUFF AND WE'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING FOR IT. AMEN. WE'RE NOT PRAYING LIKE WE OUGHT TO BE. WE'RE NOT EXPECTING LIKE WE OUGHT TO BE. AND WE SAY, "WHY ISN'T GOD DOING SOMETHING IN MY LIFE?" WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR HIM TO DO? &gt;&gt; SEE, we've got TO MAKE A PLACE TO ALLOW HIM TO DO IN OUR LIVES. AMEN. WE'LL SIT THERE AND WE'LL HAVE OUR GROCERY LIST. We pray, "Well, God, I want this and God, I want that and God, I want this." And we go to bed snore like mules. AND WE NEVER LET GOD SPEAK TO US. LISTEN, I'M NOT PRAYING TO A STONE &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; IDOL TONIGHT. MY GOD SPEAKS BACK. THAT'S WHAT THE MESSAGE PROVED. &gt;&gt; You think ABOUT THE APOSTLE PAUL, A MAN BORN OUT OF SEASON. AMEN. AND THOUGH HE'S A BLASPHER AND A PERSECUTOR OF THE CHURCH, BUT HE DOES IT IMMINENTLY, BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THIS MAN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING IN THIS MAN THAT DESIRES TO SEE GOD AND HE GETS STRUCK DOWN ONE DAY. HE'S OUT PERSECUTING CHRISTIANS. HE'S OUT LOOKING TO CAUSE TROUBLE. BUT THAT LIGHT COMES AND BROTHER SAID THE SAME LIGHT THAT STRUCK PAUL DOWN ON THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS IS THE SAME LIGHT THOSE MAGI SAW. THAT SAME LIGHT COME AND IT HUMBLED HIM AND IT BLINDED HIM BUT IT RAISED UP A DIFFERENT KIND OF MAN THAT NIGHT. &gt;&gt; So you and I ARE REPRESENTED IN THESE MAGI. AMEN. LISTEN, I WASN'T THERE. Like Jesus when he was born physically, THEY WEREN'T THERE. I WASN'T THERE. WE WEREN'T SEPARATED BY JUST 2,000 MILES, but 2,000 YEARS OF HISTORY SEPARATED US FROM THE BIRTH OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. I WASN'T THERE TO WITNESS IT. I'M NOT AN ETHNIC HEBREW. NEITHER ARE YOU. AMEN. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN US THAT COULD RECOGNIZE OUR [screaming] DAY AND ITS MESSAGE AND IT RECOGNIZED WHEN IT STRUCK THAT SEED. THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THERE TO BE QUICKENED THAT WOULD RECOGNIZE THIS IS THE WORD FOR MY DAY. YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CAN I GIVE A testimony with a little bit of voice I got LEFT HERE? AMEN. LISTEN, I REMEMBER WHEN I WHEN I WHEN THE WHEN GOD first got a hold of me and I heard this message. Amen. And listen, I I was looking. I was reading stuff TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF WACKOS IS THIS. WHAT kind of what KIND OF WEIRD STUFF DID I FIND? BUT THE MORE I LOOKED AT IT, THE MORE I RECOGNIZED IT WAS THE WORD OF GOD. IT WAS EXACTLY THE SCRIPTURE ACCORDING TO THUS, SAYETH THE LORD. BUT I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO GO VISIT SOME OTHER CHURCHES, look at different things, and listen, IT'S JUST LIKE A JERUSALEM. THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. I go DOWN HERE, THEY'RE SAYING THIS. I GO DOWN THERE, THERE WAS NO LIFE OR LIGHT IN THOSE THINGS. AMEN. BUT WHEN I COME BACK OUT AND SAID, "OKAY, I'M GOING TO TAKE MY LIFE. I'M GOING TO ORIENT MY LIFE TOWARDS THIS MESSAGE." AMEN. THERE'S NO OTHER PLACE WHERE I CAN GO TO FIND THE WORDS OF LIFE. AMEN. THAT'S WHEN I SAW THE LIGHT COME AGAIN. AND I SAID, "I'M NOT GOING TO GET AWAY FROM IT. I'M NOT GOING TO LET IT GO AGAIN. THIS IS IT. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I went to a lot of churches that should have been able to tell me, "Well, where is he?" &gt;&gt; LIKE THESE JEWS, WHERE IS HE? WELL, YOU KNOW, WE think this and we had this idea, you know, 200 years ago this or 500. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE IS HE &gt;&gt; that's born. Not where was he? I I can look that up. I need to know where HE'S AT RIGHT NOW. AND LET ME TESTIFY. NOT ONLY DID I FIND OUT WHERE HE'S AT RIGHT NOW, I AM WHERE HE'S AT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE WHERE HE'S AT RIGHT NOW. AND THAT MEANS MORE TO ME THAN ANYTHING else you could give me. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WORTH ALL MY GIFT AND ALL MY LIFE AND ALL MY EVERYTHING THAT I AM. &gt;&gt; IT'S WORTH EVERYTHING YOU GOT TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [sighs] Once I saw what this message was, it wasn't just good sermons. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just better theology or more holiness, but I [snorts] saw a light. Amen. It brought a God out of history. Amen. The same God that did those things there, HE'S DOING IT TODAY. He's doing it right here tonight in Bufort, South Carolina. AMEN. WHY? I HAVE SEEN A STAR. YOU'VE SEEN A STAR. AND YOU'VE COME TO WORSHIP HIM TONIGHT. IT'S CAUSED YOU TO REJOICE WITH EXCEEDING GREAT JOY. AMEN. THIS STAR TOLD ME THIS IS THE TIME OF HIS COMING. YEAH, &gt;&gt; IT' been one thing to read Malachi 4 AND BE LIKE, "WELL, THAT'S GREAT. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. I KNOW PEOPLE LIKE THAT. I'VE BEEN IN CHURCH." WELL, we're waiting for Malachi 4. I didn't know the people were waiting for it. &gt;&gt; Listen, Jesus own disciples DID THAT. WHEN'S ELIAS GOING TO COME? I TELL YOU, HE CAME already and you didn't recognize it. It was too humble for them. IT DIDN'T COME THE WAY THEY WANTED. THEY WANTED IN THE PALACES AND THEY WANTED IT IN THEOLOGY, BUT IT WAS RIGHT THERE WHERE HE'S ALWAYS BEEN IN HUMILITY. The time the light lets us know the time. Amen. When the ecclesiastical world walks on tonight even in ignorance and six church AGES IS ALREADY PASSED. NOT KNOW LISTEN THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEIR own hour. Oh, praise the Lord. AMEN. THINK ABOUT IT NOW. THEY DIDN'T KNOW THEIR OWN HOUR. YOU BROTHER talks about a watchman. Watchman is not JUST A PASTOR OR PREACHER. It's a prophet. Amen. He can look at the stars. He can look at the TIME WHEN THERE'S NO SUN DIAL WORKING, WHEN YOU YOU DON'T have an atomic clock. But he can look at those STARS AND HE CAN TELL YOU THE HOUR OF THE NIGHT. WE'VE HAD ONE. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT ALL WATCHMEN. WE'VE HEARD A WATCHMAN. AMEN. HE COULD LOOK AT LUTHER'S STAR AND LUTHER DIDN'T KNOW HIS DAY, BUT HE COULD LOOK AT LUTHER'S day and he COULD LOOK AT WESLEY'S DAY AND TELL THEM WHEN THEIR DAY WAS AND WHEN HIS OWN DAY WAS. HE [screaming] KNOWS WHAT TIME IT IS. [snorts] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; What's the time of it? THIS IS THE HOUR WHEN HE'S IDENTIFIED. THE SON OF MAN IS AMONGST US ONCE AGAIN. WHERE IS HE AT IN HUMAN BEINGS? HE'S STILL HERE TONIGHT. LISTEN, THE SON OF MAN DIDN'T DISAPPEAR IN 1965 AND WE'RE WANDERING AROUND IN DARKNESS. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? I DON'T KNOW. HE'S STILL HERE TONIGHT. THE MESSAGE LIVES. CHRIST LIVES TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, brother Brandon was baptized in the Ohio River one day. Amen. He was baptizing that 17th person out there in the river. Amen. And that great light descended upon him. AND WHAT DID THE VOICE DO? IT TOLD HIM THE HOUR THAT IT WAS COMING INTO AS JOHN THE [screaming] BAPTIST FORERUN THE FIRST COMING OF CHRIST. SO YOUR MESSAGE WILL FORERUN THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST. THE STAR IDENTIFIES THE HOUR THAT HE'S LIVING IN. I LOVE BROTHER TALKS about the newspaper. The newspaper ran this headline. Mystic star. MYSTIC STAR APPEARS OVER MINISTER BAPTIZED IN THE RIVER. IF THAT'S NOT THE SAME LIGHT TONIGHT, AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE SAME LIGHT, THE SAME THING THE MAGI SAW, THE SAME THING THAT PAUL SAW, WE HAVE BEEN A WITNESS TO IN THIS GENERATION. [panting] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And we've come tonight. Listen, it's not just the mystic star that appeared, but there are seven stars in the right hand of this one like the son of man. And all these stars were important and I appreciate God. I thank God for all these stars. But there was a notable one among them. There was one that could identify our age. Amen. And what did the star come to do? The light the star didn't come to lead you to itself. [panting] &gt;&gt; Listen, brother didn't come to say, "Hey, look at me." &gt;&gt; As some people do. you know, they're they're looking for him to do this and they think he he rose on the third day. The light come to lead them to the Lord Jesus. THE THE THE CANDLESTICKS and the inner court was to lead them into the presence OF GOD. AND THIS STAR THAT HAS COME IN OUR AGE, THIS PROPHETIC MINISTRY HAS COME TO REVEAL THE FULLNESS OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [sighs] These guys come like we've come and they didn't just come with a a greeting card and a congratulations. Hey, congratulations, Mary. You did a good job. Way to fulfill the scripture. HEY, [screaming] JOSEPH, GOOD JOB. DON'T YOU DROP HIM NOW. They come to worship him. [gasps] We've seen a star. We've come to worship him that's born king of the Jews. we had come to rejoice. And like I said, these guys didn't make a hop, skip, and a jump. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; They didn't just run downtown to pick up some milk. They're about as far away as a pre a people could be in the civilized world at that time. Amen. Brother Brandon says this, they straddled their camels and started on hundreds times hundreds of miles of journey. It wasn't an overnight. It taken two years for them to get there. And some of us won't walk two city blocks to get to him or from the MIDDLE OF THE TABERNACLE to the altar to get to him. &gt;&gt; Well, praise God, man. I thought you'all be running after that one. It's quite a statement. &gt;&gt; And listen, I'm not downing anybody. You couldn't make it tonight or what. I'm not That's not what I'm getting at. Amen. When these guys wanted to see Jesus, they found a way. That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, we don't really have a way to do it. They'll find a way. &gt;&gt; I I don't know. You I'll say it this way. Listen, when when I was a sinner and I wanted to do something, I found a way to do it. &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't got no money. I ain't got no right. Well, guess what? I'll beg, borrow, and steal to do something you want to do. Listen, if you love rock and roll music and you love concerts and you ain't got a DIME AND NOBODY, YOU'LL FIND A WAY IF YOU LIKE IT BAD ENOUGH. YOU LOOK AT ADDICTS. HEY, MAN. THEY AIN'T GOT NOTHING. BUT THEY FIND A WAY TO GET THEIR FIG. YOU WANT SOMETHING BAD ENOUGH, YOU'LL FIND A WAY TO GET IT. &gt;&gt; But these men SAID, "WE WANT TO SEE JESUS. WE WANT TO SEE THIS ONE THAT DANIEL TALKED ABOUT." AND THEY FOUND A WAY. LISTEN, WHEN YOU REALLY mean business, AND YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE JESUS, YOU'LL FIND A WAY. &gt;&gt; WELL, I BELIEVE GOD USED TO DO THAT, BUT NOT TODAY. NOT MY SITUATION. OH YES. IF YOU BELIEVE HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER, YOU'LL FIND A WAY. YOU'LL FIND A WAY. LISTEN, GOD CAN MAKE YOU A WAY WHEN THERE IS NO WAY. GOD BROUGHT THE GIFTS TO HIMSELF TO IDENTIFY. LET ME SAY TONIGHT, HE'S STILL A HEALER. &gt;&gt; HE'S STILL A SAVIOR. &gt;&gt; HE STILL GIVES THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO TESTIFY THAT MORE THAN YOU WANT IT. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU. YOU SAY, "I'M A YOUNG PERSON. I NEED THE HOLY GHOST. I'M AN OLD PERSON. I NEED THE HOLY GHOST." LISTEN, HE WANTS YOU TO HAVE IT MORE THAN YOU WANT IT. &gt;&gt; WE GET THIS WISHY-WASHY ATTITUDE. WELL, YEAH, BLESS GOD. I WANT THIS, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF GOD WANTS THIS FOR ME. LISTEN, IT'S NOT GOD HOLDING BACK FROM YOU. IT'S US HOLDING BACK ON GOD. &gt;&gt; TALKS ABOUT IN THE THIRD EXODUS, THE THESE JEWS, THEY'RE OUT THERE IN THE WILDERNESS. THEY'RE WAITING ON GOD. THEY'RE WAITING ON GOD. BROTHER SAID, BROTHER SAID GOD WAS WAITING ON THEM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Let's not keep God waiting. Yeah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET'S NOT MAKE SOME OF US HAVE MADE HIM WAIT A REALLY LONG time [panting] because we don't pay attention. We don't want to this. It would inconvenience us. Let's not make God wait. He's a gentleman. He's waited long enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. [sighs] &gt;&gt; It's not God holding back tonight. [gasps] God wants you to have the blessing more than you want the blessing. And as soon as you recognize that, you'll go to any length. You'll pack whatever camels. Listen, when that woman with a blood issue realized my, you think about this woman, think about what she went through. And we read that like a newspaper. Well, bless God, she went with 12 years and she had a blood issue. [gasps and sighs] Listen, this woman, SHE IS CEREMONIALLY UNCLEAN. THIS IS NOT JUST, WELL, I'VE HAD THIS THIS PROBLEM FOR 12 YEARS. THIS HAS RADICALLY RUINED HER LIFE FOR 12 YEARS. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE HAD A FAMILY AND KIDS OR WHATEVER before that, but listen, IF SHE DID, SHE CAN'T SEE HIM. SHE CAN'T LIVE IN HER HOME. She can't this. SHE THIS THIS HAS UPENDED HER WHOLE LIFE. AND DOCTORS BACK THEN, THEY'RE LIKE DOCTORS TODAY. YOU CAN GIVE THEM ALL YOUR MONEY AND THEY DON'T DO NOTHING, BUT THEY KEEP YOUR MONEY. &gt;&gt; No offense to the medical professionals. I know you got to get paid. LISTEN, SHE'D SPENT ALL HER LIVING ON THIS and was none the better, BUT SHE WAS WORSE. BUT WHEN SHE SAW HER CHANCE, SHE didn't sit there and him holler on, "Well, I HOPE SOMEBODY PASS ME OVER TO HIM. I HOPE THERE'S A WAY. I I I DON'T WANT TO BE UNDIGNIFIED." &gt;&gt; SHE GOT IN THE MUD AND SHE CRAWLED, SAID, "I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT MY BLESSING. I'M [screaming] NOT GOING OUT THE WAY I CAME IN EVER AGAIN." AND WHEN YOU GET THAT ATTITUDE, THAT'S WHEN SOMETHING CAN HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; Can you IMAGINE THESE MEN GO FOR A 18 MONTHS AND SAY, "WELL, bless God, it's been a hard journey. [snorts] Let's just GO BACK. WE'LL GET A HEAD [screaming] START NOW. IT WON'T TAKE WE'LL GET BACK ABOUT A YEAR EARLIER." NO, we come too far. [panting] &gt;&gt; GOD INSPIRED US. God ordained us. But they're a BUNCH OF NOBODYIES. THEY'RE UNIMPORTANT. THERE'S SOMEBODY TO GOD. DON'T EVER LET THE DEVIL TELL YOU YOU'RE A NOBODY. IF YOU'VE SEEN THIS, YOU'RE A SOMEBODY. THESE PEOPLE ARE AS NOBODY AS NOBODY COULD BE. BUT GOD HAD TO FULFILL HIS WORD CUZ HE TOLD ABRAHAM 2,000 YEARS PRIOR, IN YOU SHALL ALL NATIONS BE BLESSED. &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE A GENTILE GROUP TO RECEIVE THAT WORD AND BE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. Oh my. [panting and sighs] They were desperate. We've got to get to them. Our mission's too important. &gt;&gt; Our mission is too important to give up now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for somebody TO COME UP AND FILL UP THE CHARGE. I'm not calling AAA or Uber. Hey, can you can you deliver this FOR ME? IT'S ALL OR NOTHING. Jesus or bust. Amen. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING ALL THE WAY OR WE'RE GOING TO DIE TRYING. [sighs and gasps] [panting] &gt;&gt; SEE, what you press for shows where your faith at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got a real need, you'll get down in your prayer closet. You'll get down in your altar and you'll When was the last time some of us prayed through? We used to talk about praying through. &gt;&gt; Last time we really GOT DOWN AND PRAYED THROUGH ON SOMETHING. SEE, I'M GOING TO GET DOWN here and I'm going to pray and if I DON'T HEAR FROM GOD, THERE'S GOING TO BE A PILE OF BONES here when he comes back. &gt;&gt; We got real serious about it. We love to have fun. We love TO FRAUD. WHEN WAS THE LAST time we got real serious, real reverent about it, real life and death? &gt;&gt; See, it's okay if it works out or doesn't, whatever. See, that's why so many times, not I'm not trying to take everything that's ever, but I'm I'm telling you this. We We don't take it seriously enough. These men took it seriously and you've got a lot more tonight than they had to work with. God help me. Okay, raise my hand. God help me. Amen. We get in trouble. We'll get on the phone. We'll ask a bunch of people. We'll Google our symptoms and before you know it, we've got six different things. [panting] Well, I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S THIS. We'll go to the doctor and he'll say this. I think it's this. Why are you going to the doctor? You know better than him. Sometimes you do, but that's one of them. We got it all figured out except we don't have the answer because he's the answer. We're raising our hands. What are we going to do? AMEN. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO ABOUT MY PROBLEM? WHAT AM I GOING TO DO ABOUT MY SITUATION? WHAT WE SHOULD BE ASKING IS WHERE WHERE IS HE THAT'S BORN king of THE JEWS? WHERE IS GOD? WHAT DOES GOD WANT TO DO WITH LISTEN, GOD DON'T JUST PUT YOU IN SITUATIONS TO PUT YOU IN SITUATIONS. GOD'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. HE'S TRYING TO DRAW THINGS OUT OF YOUR LIFE. AMEN. He's trying to He's TRYING TO TAKE YOUR LIFE AND MAKE IT A TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; We're just praying for answers. What we need to do is pray for God, show me the bigger picture. &gt;&gt; What are you trying to reveal &gt;&gt; to me? Well, you know, I was sick and nobody came to see me. Well, the Bible says you call for the elders. Amen. Nobody cares about me. Well, maybe they didn't know you were sick. You never talked to anybody anyway. All right. &gt;&gt; Listen, I I hope this I I'm kind of a closet introvert. I don't know if that's a thing. Why do people talk to me? Well, you'd have to talk to them every now and then, I guess. You know how it is. We We get a complex. Nobody loves me. God don't care about me. Well, that wasn't God that told you that. &gt;&gt; That was your imagination. That was your idea. We did what I'm all over the place here. We do what Jacob did when he found out about Joseph. We begin to invent things in our minds. Well, he must be dead. It must be this. IT MUST BE THAT. WE DON'T KNOW THAT. &gt;&gt; BUT WE'LL INVENT something in our mind and we'll live off of that imagination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We all want the KINGDOM OF GOD AND all the blessings just to fall in our lap. But listen, we're called to be overcomers. &gt;&gt; That means you and I tonight, we've got something to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every man that wants in this kingdom, he's got to press into it. &gt;&gt; There's got to be something in us that it's not that we're driven, it's that we're led. &gt;&gt; Something is drawing us. Something is leading us. Brother talks about that little chicken in the egg. Let me say it this way. Can I say eaglets tonight? That chicken, whatever. That little chicken in the egg. Amen. If you try to bust it through it shell for it, YOU'LL KILL IT. THE STRUGGLE IS WHAT GIVES US THE STRENGTH NOT ONLY TO COME THROUGH THE SHELL TO HAVE ITS BREAKTHROUGH BUT TO LIVE AFTERWARDS. AMEN. And God will put YOU IN SITU. HE'S NOT TRYING TO DESTROY YOU. HE'S TRYING TO MAKE YOU STRONGER. HE'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THINGS ABOUT YOU THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT YOU. I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD SURVIVE THIS. I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD GO THROUGH THAT. BUT GOD MADE A WAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU BEEN THROUGH THE WORST THINGS IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU SIT THERE SAYING, "WHY [screaming] DID I GO THROUGH THAT?" CUZ GOD'S TRYING TO HELP YOU BREAK THROUGH THE SHELL TO THE NEXT LEVEL. &gt;&gt; HE DON'T WANT YOU JUST STAY IN THERE. HE'S GOT SOMETHING &gt;&gt; FOR US TONIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SAY, "How do I break through the same way you do anything as a Christian?" By faith. &gt;&gt; Your whole armor is supernatural. It's all by faith. Listen, with faith and patience, you can inherit any promise. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." [snorts] It's time for us to break out of our shell to to have our breakthrough. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says this, "What does that star mean to us today, friend?" Daniel gives us the answer. Daniel said, Daniel 12:3, it said, "They, those that are wise and know their God shall shine as the firmaments of the heaven, and those that turn many to righteousness. God help us tonight. Those that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever. He says, "What are we today then? We are stars." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not a rock star or a movie star, but I'm that kind of a star. I'm the kind that Abraham saw. &gt;&gt; You're the kind Abraham saw when God said, "Look up." &gt;&gt; You're representing that tonight. Amen. We are stars. Every born again Christian is a testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ. A star to reflect the power and holiness of the Lord Jesus. To reflect him in his life, to perfect him in his speech, to perfect him in his healing power, to perfect him in his resurrection, to reflect HIM IN EVERY WAY THAT HE WAS REFLECTED TO US BY GOD THE FATHER. WE are stars. &gt;&gt; Got a whole constellation here tonight. Listen, I know there's lots of darkness and chaos in the world today. Amen. But listen, that's how it was. It wasn't a picnic for these magi either. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way it was in that day, too. But they saw the light &gt;&gt; and they overcame obstacles. They overcame coldness. They overcame heat. They overcame distance and HUNGER AND PROBLEMS. THEY OVERCOME THE RELIGIOUS rejection of the day they lived IN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY FOLLOWED THE light of that star. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when THEY SAW IT, THEY FOUND, LISTEN, THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES GAVE THEM NO REASON TO REJOICE. THEIR TRIALS GAVE THEM NO REASON TO REJOICE. BUT WHEN THEY COME TO THE CONCLUSION OF THAT STAR, THEY FOUND A REASON TO REJOICE. NOT BECAUSE OF THE HEAT, NOT BECAUSE OF THE COLD, BUT BECAUSE THEY FOUND THE ONE IT WAS POINTING THEM TO. AMEN. AND WHEN THEY SAW THE STAR, THEY REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING GREAT JOY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We ought to be the happiest people on the earth tonight. You know, brother M said the human heart wasn't made to be upset. It wasn't made to be sad. &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, that's not always seems to be the case with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you were made to be happy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. [sighs] Praise the Lord. Listen, tonight, each one of us, we all have gifts tonight like these men did. But it's not just that we have gifts. We are gifts. man. Well, you should feel pretty good about yourself there. Listen, YOU YOU ARE GIFTS. YOU'RE NOT JUST carrying light. You are the light of the world. Now, Jesus said, you're the ones that are showing or reflecting or revealing IT TONIGHT. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE REVEALED down the street. IT'S NOT REVEALED in the HALLS OF POLITICS. IT'S NOT REVEALED ANYWHERE BUT IN THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU DON'T JUST HAVE A GIFT. YOU HAVE GIFTS, BUT YOU ARE GIFTS. AND LET ME JUST SAY THIS, YOU'RE NOT JUST GIFTS TO A DYING WORLD. YOUR GIFTS TO ONE ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; NOW, you might not always feel that way about it. Some of you might be looking at the clock now. I don't know how I feel about that right now about this guy, &gt;&gt; whether you like it or not. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this. Don't throw away the wrap the gift because you don't like the wrapping paper. And then don't throw away because you DON'T LIKE THE LOOK AT WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE. I'VE NEVER GOT A GIFT AND SAID, "WELL, I don't want this because of the wrapping with Listen, I can't wrap it to save. That's why I pay somebody else to wrap my gifts. I can't do that. My wife like you do it. You're better than me." I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about. YOU COULDN'T DO ANY WORSE THAN ME. But nobody ever looks at your gift and says, "Well, I don't like how it's wrapped. I don't want that." Whatever. They just rip it off. And you got some of you weirdos that save the paper. And that's why you do gift bags. &gt;&gt; It's what's the inside. &gt;&gt; It's what you got on the inside. Amen. You are gifts tonight to one another. And if you treat each other that way, it'll bless you that way. &gt;&gt; We look at the lengths they went to to bring their gift to Jesus. And I ask us tonight for each one of us, what are we doing tonight with our gift? &gt;&gt; How far are we willing to go for the cause of Christ? Amen. Listen, Jesus, he was sitting in the the corner of the house one day in Simon the Pharisees house. And there was a little ill-famed woman, a nobody kind of like these mag, she was so ill-famed. These men said, "If this man was a prophet, he would know what kind of woman this is. He would know what she's like." But this woman, she went and she decided, "I'm going to anoint the feet of Jesus. I'm not going to let him sit there with unwashing feet." And she goes, and I love how Brother Bam says it. She goes to buy this anointing oil. And she never said, "Give me a good one." She said, "Give me the best one [snorts] cuz he's worthy of the best." Brother Bam says, "What do we give him?" The leftover. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll preach to me for just a minute so you all don't feel guilty. We're guilty. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just give him the leftover. Brother says, "We'll run around all day. We're busy." And we'll give him three minutes at the end of the day. Now, I know, now listen, I know some of you get busy. I understand that. If we're not careful, that becomes our whole life. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll give him what I got left over. I'll give him what I GOT LEFT. WE'LL GIVE him the leftovers and he'll take what you give him. &gt;&gt; But he deserves the best. &gt;&gt; Listen, Samson gave GOD HIS STRENGTH, but not his heart. And God TOOK HIS STRENGTH AND HE USED HIS STRENGTH, but God deserved his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you decide to give God tonight, I want you to rest assured God will take it. &gt;&gt; He's a gentleman. He'll take what you give him. But I want to remind you tonight in this season of gift giving, he deserves the very best. &gt;&gt; He doesn't deserve We'll We'll put some of us I hope this is okay. Some of us will put some time this season to picking out the perfect gift for everybody. &gt;&gt; And we'll and and that's fine. Hey, whatever. You know, I'm not I'll let the pastor deal with that. But we we we will dedicate time and energy and effort and thoughtfulness towards these gifts. &gt;&gt; What are we doing with our gifts for Jesus? Does that reflect our attitude towards Listen, it's his birthday. Well, not really, but [laughter] what are we doing for him? &gt;&gt; Amen. He deserves the very best. I know we're getting ready to have a prayer meeting here in just a moment. Maybe tonight when you come up for prayer, maybe you make your dedic maybe if you've never made your dedication to him tonight. If you have, maybe make a rededication tonight as we go into this season. He deserves the very best. that we can give him because he gave us &gt;&gt; the very best that he could give. If there's anything greater he could have given, he to give it. We're guilty. I'm guilty. I raise my hand. We're guilty so many times of giving them our leftovers. I say, "God, forgive me. &gt;&gt; I want to be like these men. I I want to I want to endure. I don't want to get to the end of my life and say, well, you know, I did this little thing here and this and that." I want to be able to say, "Listen, like that man that got up on that chariot, listen, I'm bearing scars in my body. [panting] It was worth it. Whatever I went through, whatever I suffered, it was worth it to bring my gift to Jesus to come to where he was taking me." You believe that tonight? You stand to your feet. Let's just pray together tonight. God bless you. So happy to be with you tonight. You know, I I appreciate the welcoming spirit and I trust, Lord, we just continue to bless each one of you as we pray tonight. Heavenly Father, we every one of us, Lord, is is guilty at times. &gt;&gt; Lord, we think of these priests in the book of Malachi. They would bring these inferior offerings. God, you charged them. You wouldn't give this to your governor. You wouldn't give this to a father. Lord, we are guilty sometimes of giving to you less than we would give a natural boss or a father, a pastor. Lord, how we ought to to be ashamed tonight. Lord, I'm ashamed of them many [music] times. But Lord, tonight I'm thankful that there's a place for your grace. And Lord, that you don't cast us off. Lord, we just want to take a few moments to examine ourselves and and re rededicate ourselves to this purpose. Say, Lord, what you'd have of my life, I want you to have it all, Lord. I want you to have my heart. I want my desires. I want to orient my my entire being around this great light. I don't want to give you second or third or fourth place, but I want to always be my priority. I want to I want to make time to listen for the voice of the Lord. I want to make time to ask, "What do you want from me today, oh God? WHAT WOULD PLEASE YOU, my Lord?" Brother Brandham, he said, "Always there's a tension in our lives. Am I pleasing my Lord? If I could hear from him, may that be the very resonance of every believer's heart tonight, I pray, am I pleasing my Lord? If I could hear from him, take these dear ones, these children that you've purchased by the precious blood of Jesus Christ and may you just use them for your glory. Strengthen, establish, and settle every heart we pray. And we thank you for this time in Jesus [music] Christ's name. Amen. Let's go ahead and sing that song. myself away.

I don't know about you, but I just felt there as brother Alex was just closing. Amen. So appreciated [music] the word but just felt the Holy Spirit just speaking maybe directly amen to my heart [music] maybe you'd want to identify the same thing to say Lord I want to make [music] sure that you're first place &gt;&gt; oh yes &gt;&gt; in every part of my life as our brother quoted brother Brandham [music] so well he'll take whatever you can give him whatever you're willing to he'll take it but he deserves to be first place and I just want to say in this season of giving and and Christmas.

There's nothing more than I want to. No matter what you can give me, no matter what I can gain, there's [music] nothing greater than I give Jesus. number one, first place. Lord, that's our prayer tonight. I raise my hands, Lord, in identification, Lord. The word just pricricked our heart. We're thankful for that, Lord Jesus. Thankful, [music] Lord, that we can still be moved by your word. &gt;&gt; We live in such a world, Lord, where services and they've been preached to so much and heard sermon after sermon and gets to a place, Lord, where it doesn't even affect them. I'm just so thankful, Lord, that I can still be moved in my spirit by your word, Lord, where the word is [music] can stab me in the heart as they did on that day of Pentecost. Lord, when the Bible says they were pricricked in their heart, [music] Lord, thank you, Father, that you can still stir us, still speak to us, Lord. Thank you for using our brother Alex, Lord God, to deliver your word. Now, God, I just raise my hand and say, Lord, [music] I I I want to give you first place, first priority, God. May you be the first thought that I think of Lord when I wake up in the morning. May you [music] your word be the first thing upon my lips. Not my problems, not my Lord, even the goals that I'm trying to [music] attain or the Lord the tasks that I need to complete, Lord. But may I look to you first, Lord God. First above all things, [music] Jesus, I pray. Grant it now, Lord Jesus. I pray you'd, Lord, just minister to our brother Alex, Lord, as he's poured his heart out, Father, to be used, Lord. May you pour back into him. We ask it in Jesus name. Whatever it takes to draw [music and singing] closer to you, Lord. That's what [music] That's what I'll be willing to do.

[music] Sister Sarah Smith and then those that are sick. Amen. Brother Alex, come now if you could pray here. [music] Let's believe together. Heavenly Father, Lord, there was many different needs represented here tonight. And besides that, many unspoken ones here just gathered around this altar this evening. Lord, the scripture says that many are the afflictions of the righteous, but that you would [music] deliver us out of them all. And we're thankful tonight. You never promised us a flowery bed of ease. We're not a bunch of hot bed plants tonight, [music] but we are ordained to endure and to overcome. And Father, we see the different things before us. But before any of these needs were known to us or voiced tonight, [music] you knew the need before we asked. And we believe that a divine provision has been made before [music] the foundation of the world. For you're still Jehovah Gyra tonight. You're the God that sees. You see it and you see to it. And you've undertaken for every situation tonight. Lord, just now we commit them into your hands. May you take these [music] trials and turn them into testimonies and trophies of your grace. Bless these different ones. We're so thankful you answer prayer, Lord. not just for our sakes tonight, but you said you would do it that the Father would be glorified. And we thank you. We rejoice now [music] and in time to come. That you are faithful to answer prayer and that you've seen these Lord. May you do exceeding abundantly above the things that we could ask or even think tonight and bless these children once more. We ask we thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll take [music] a minute if there's a testimony something pressing. We didn't I think do it last time. Anybody got anything [music] quick before we go? Testimony somebody wants to share. Amen. If not, we'll sing and let you. How many appreciate our brother Alex? Want to let our brother Alex know [music] how much you appreciated him. [applause] Amen. Thank you, God. Appreciate him and his family. They're here visiting. Amen. Brother Aaron and uh Sister Ruth. Amen. [music] Good friends. And so we really appreciate he was willing to serve and minister to us tonight. Greetings to shake somebody's hand before you go before you're dismissed. Tell him, "God bless you. Good to see you all [music] in the house of the Lord." Lord willing, we'll see you Sunday and then this weekend [music] share and show me how to [music] grow in [singing] beauty in God. [music] There is [music] something made me a reflection [music and singing] of your love. &gt;&gt; [music]
