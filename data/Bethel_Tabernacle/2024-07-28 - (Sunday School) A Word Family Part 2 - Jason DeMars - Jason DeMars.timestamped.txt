[5:13] morning everyone God bless you let's go
[5:17] ahead and pull up the PowerPoint and
[5:19] we'll stand and read the
[5:23] word continuing from the subject from
[5:28] last week oh word
[5:30] family and we're going to look at
[5:33] Ephesians chapter
[5:36] 5 and verse
[5:38] 23 for the husband is the head of the
[5:41] wife even as Christ is the head of the
[5:43] church and he is the savior of the body
[5:47] Heavenly Father we just come to you and
[5:49] we want to commit this time to you Lord
[5:50] we ask that your Holy Spirit would come
[5:53] take your word break it open to our
[5:54] hearts Lord may may you you anoint both
[5:57] the speaker and the the hearer Lord For
[6:01] Your Glory we commit ourselves to you in
[6:03] Jesus name amen be
[6:08] seated so in looking
[6:11] at uh this subject looking
[6:15] at a word family is in in every
[6:21] age there's there's a reason there's a
[6:24] cause for
[6:25] alarm and there's also a cause for
[6:28] Brokenness
[6:30] and um we're all born into families that
[6:36] have people who have a sinful nature in
[6:39] them that they're battling against and
[6:42] you know in some ages you could go back
[6:44] and say we're we're looking at needing
[6:47] to rebuke the men so hard because
[6:50] they're mistreating their wives uh and
[6:54] that though that is certainly the case
[6:56] in uh wow we're empty I want to look
[6:59] this way there's nobody
[7:02] there but God is
[7:05] good so you have you have a situation
[7:09] now where
[7:10] feminism has come to its final
[7:14] fruition and any expression of manhood
[7:17] is many times is the world wants to
[7:21] suppress it and Men respond by either
[7:25] checking out or they respond by
[7:28] feminizing in themselves so that they
[7:31] can be acceptable to what the proper
[7:34] expression of human life is however I
[7:37] believe a real man of God would stand up
[7:40] and
[7:41] fight in every age and in every
[7:44] generation uh there's a reason there's a
[7:47] cause that we need to battle for there's
[7:50] a message that's going forth and you
[7:52] know when there is when there is
[7:55] Brokenness what happens is that
[7:58] Brokenness to often gets passed on then
[8:01] to the Next
[8:03] Generation and when that Brokenness is
[8:06] then passed on to the next
[8:08] Generation what you have is another
[8:11] response in that Sons will respond One
[8:13] Way daughters will respond another way
[8:16] and at some point in time all of us have
[8:18] to say this stops here I'm a
[8:23] Christian I believe the word I'm filled
[8:26] with the Holy Ghost that means I'm
[8:29] Healed
[8:30] am I don't need to uh I don't need to
[8:33] stand here and submit myself to
[8:37] perverted uh perverted examples that
[8:40] I've had from the past or acting out of
[8:42] the Brokenness that I have from the
[8:45] past instead of living in that place why
[8:48] don't we invite the Lord Jesus Christ
[8:51] into those situations that that caused
[8:54] the
[8:56] Brokenness let him come and stand
[9:00] stand with
[9:02] you in those situations of of abuse and
[9:06] and pain and even just the wrong example
[9:10] that the Lord Jesus was there with you
[9:12] if you're predestinated seed he didn't
[9:14] just suddenly come upon you when you got
[9:16] born again he had his hand on you before
[9:20] you were ever born and he was molding
[9:23] and shaping you into the person that
[9:26] you're supposed to be only let him
[9:29] redeem you from that Brokenness and then
[9:33] as there is Brokenness and there's
[9:36] always good or B good or bad you know
[9:39] you can be you could be raised in a
[9:41] situation where it's all bad you could
[9:43] be raised in a situation where it's a
[9:45] combination there's some good good stuff
[9:47] and there's some bad stuff or it could
[9:49] just be all good I'm pretty sure that's
[9:51] probably not all good because you're
[9:53] you're all we're all dealing with
[9:55] parents that uh didn't set a perfect
[9:58] example right and so neither neither do
[10:02] we and our children I I
[10:05] trust the Lord will enter into their
[10:08] hurts and their pains and will give them
[10:11] strength and deliver them as we talked
[10:13] about in overcoming depression we're all
[10:15] responsible for our own response to
[10:19] whatever situation we've went through we
[10:22] can't BL well my dad was this way my mom
[10:24] was this way certainly that has an
[10:26] impact but when you're a Christian old
[10:29] things are passed away all things are
[10:31] become new so don't don't walk under the
[10:35] Yoke of bondage see when you're not when
[10:38] you're not a Believer you have no choice
[10:39] you're walking under the Yoke of bondage
[10:41] but when you become a Believer you can
[10:43] choose to go back and walk under this
[10:47] yoke or you can choose to walk in
[10:50] Freedom that's what the Holy Ghost gives
[10:53] us and so I had that on my heart to
[10:56] start and say say that but looking at
[11:00] the hour that we're living in it's time
[11:02] for Christian men to throw off modern
[11:06] culture and the F feminization of
[11:08] everything and become real men again
[11:13] unafraid
[11:15] unafraid and and I I'll just say it this
[11:18] way our
[11:20] culture has trained us to be
[11:23] afraid of
[11:26] women it's trained us we should be
[11:28] afraid and not we should bow down before
[11:31] the idol of women that's what it's
[11:34] become the prophet said that it becomes
[11:36] an idol and it's it's dangerous the only
[11:39] one we're worshiping should be the Lord
[11:41] Jesus Christ amen and everyone else we
[11:44] are serving them and loving them and
[11:46] giving unto them and forgiving them but
[11:49] we don't have to be enter ourselves
[11:52] under this yoke of idolatrous burden and
[11:57] fear we have to become real Real Men
[12:00] Real leaders a real leader does not hurt
[12:03] and
[12:04] abuse those who he's leading that's not
[12:08] leadership that's
[12:10] dictatorship and it's evil a real leader
[12:14] understands that his duty is to do good
[12:17] to those that he's
[12:19] leading to serve and care for them and
[12:23] provide the necessary means for them to
[12:26] grow spiritually if we can understand
[12:30] what love is what is what what what is
[12:33] ultimately love in a Christian
[12:36] environment it is empowering and
[12:39] strengthening spiritual
[12:41] growth outside of that that's what God
[12:43] is doing so if we're standing in the way
[12:46] of people's spiritual growth what is
[12:48] that that's
[12:50] evil so if we're damaging hurting and
[12:54] and in minimizing and taking away
[12:56] people's spiritual growth
[12:59] then that's that's that's evil that's
[13:02] wickedness but if if we're living in
[13:05] such a way that we're helping others
[13:06] around us to grow in the Lord that is
[13:10] real genuine love it's projecting
[13:13] something out of yourself to help them
[13:15] grow up in Christ and so when you
[13:19] understand that as a man as a real
[13:20] leader you have that Vision you have
[13:23] that direction you're looking at life
[13:25] through that lens I am here to do good
[13:29] good to my wife to do good to my
[13:32] children not to control and manipulate
[13:34] them but to help them to grow up into
[13:37] Christ Real
[13:40] Men Are Men of Honor men of strength men
[13:44] of Bravery men of virtue they speak the
[13:47] truth in love they're courageous they're
[13:51] willing to die for the truth and they're
[13:54] willing to die to protect their wives
[13:57] and children that is is a real
[14:01] man and so we understand also that men
[14:05] are the stronger vessel that's never not
[14:07] been the case that's always been true so
[14:10] when the feminization of culture took
[14:12] place when women as brother Bram show
[14:15] showed us in America women got the
[14:17] vote this started taking the nation in
[14:20] the wrong direction and results in the
[14:22] the wickedness and immorality that we
[14:25] have for today so when when a woman
[14:29] usurp the authority of a man who has to
[14:32] let do
[14:35] it a man he has to let her do it so in
[14:39] our society the men let the women do
[14:42] what they're doing today and we've
[14:44] reached this place where we have a a
[14:48] wicked communist woman who's at the head
[14:50] of the Democrat Party
[14:53] now and so what what is what what is
[14:57] this that's happened it's men who are
[14:59] are
[14:59] weak men who don't want to speak the
[15:02] truth men who are unwilling to be brave
[15:05] to be
[15:06] courageous they simply have laid down
[15:09] their s the swords of their strength and
[15:12] allowed the woman to trample over them
[15:16] it can't be so you have to know who you
[15:18] are in Christ you have to take a stand
[15:21] and be a real man of Truth virtue
[15:26] strength and bravery so once the man
[15:29] allowed the woman to get out of her
[15:31] place then motherhood gets out of its
[15:35] place in the very next breath as we
[15:38] spoke about before brother brandham said
[15:40] the backbone of the nation is the mother
[15:45] right well
[15:48] then if if the mother is the backbone of
[15:51] the nation what is father he's the
[15:53] foundation of the nation that's what
[15:56] everyone else is going to walk upon
[15:59] what what you live how you live is going
[16:02] to be the foundation of what your
[16:04] children walk upon in their life and so
[16:08] when motherhood gets out of its place
[16:10] manhoods descent into sissified
[16:13] conditions ensues
[16:17] ensues this modern
[16:19] world of effeminate men what do they
[16:22] what is it now we've got skinny jeans
[16:25] and bangs over the forehead floppy
[16:28] floppy hair in your eyes I mean brother
[16:30] Bram condemned that so clearly the 1960s
[16:34] version what about today it's cissified
[16:37] it's not young men trying to be real men
[16:40] it's young young men being a bunch of
[16:45] boys not expressing real manhood why
[16:48] because they're not allowed to express
[16:50] real real manhood because it's not
[16:52] accepted their mothers won't accept it
[16:54] so what are they going to do they're
[16:55] going to go play video games because
[16:57] this is the way now I can express my
[17:00] manhood correctly is by doing killing
[17:04] video games you're not expressing your
[17:06] manhood that's further sissifying you
[17:09] and turning you into what the prophet
[17:11] called a
[17:14] jellyfish and that's the that's the age
[17:17] and that's the condition
[17:20] weak cissified men and entertainment of
[17:24] course portrays man as a bumbling fool
[17:28] of course he's protect and saved over
[17:29] and over again by the wisdom and
[17:32] strength of his
[17:33] wife he's just sort of along for the
[17:36] ride right I you see that the the men
[17:41] you know wife plans everything handles
[17:44] the finances does everything he's just
[17:45] sort of
[17:47] like he's another one of the kids what
[17:50] are we doing next
[17:52] I this is not an expression of real
[17:57] manhood not only that but we we have as
[17:59] brother brandham told us in the in the
[18:01] food supply it's been
[18:05] perverted by hybrids by
[18:07] GMOs and then also by inserting soy
[18:11] products in almost
[18:13] everything it's a estrogen turns men
[18:16] literally turns men into
[18:21] jellyfish and again God has a means and
[18:24] a and a way for young men to learn how
[18:28] to express their
[18:32] manhood we talked about before
[18:35] manliness starts with leadership and it
[18:38] starts with having a vision and a
[18:40] mission and a purpose in your life and
[18:44] working with the audacity to fulfill
[18:47] that and a real godly woman that's
[18:50] exactly what she's looking for she's not
[18:52] looking for someone that's searching for
[18:55] her she's praying for a Godly Man that
[18:59] has a vision that's looking forward that
[19:02] knows what he wants to accomplish in his
[19:04] life and that she can come and be his
[19:06] helper in that mission remember what we
[19:10] said before did God create Adam and say
[19:12] your mission is
[19:14] Eve no Adam came with a pre-existing
[19:19] Mission take dominion and
[19:22] multiply could Adam multiply on his own
[19:26] he could not he could take Dominion on
[19:28] his own certainly but it would be quite
[19:30] a limited
[19:32] Dominion a woman she can't take Dominion
[19:35] on her own she's a weaker vessel she
[19:37] struggles with that but a man can take
[19:41] Dominion a a woman being a weaker vessel
[19:45] can't do that but she can she can God
[19:48] uses her to
[19:51] multiply see so you see with the very
[19:54] design of creation and the Order of
[19:57] creation we we see God completing his
[20:01] picture right the the woman is designed
[20:04] to be weaker she's designed to as Paul
[20:08] said have a Meek and quiet Spirit not a
[20:11] loud boisterous overpowering personality
[20:15] but a Meek and quiet Spirit that's by
[20:17] Design it's a
[20:18] nurturing spirit that's what he's
[20:20] designed her to be not a leading Spirit
[20:23] but a nurturing spirit and the man is
[20:26] designed to lead to direct direct to be
[20:30] the
[20:31] head I just love how uncomfortable the
[20:34] devil gets when I preach
[20:38] this so we looked at this the husband is
[20:41] the head of the wife even as Christ is
[20:43] the head of the church this is by Design
[20:46] This is God's Eternal purpose God's
[20:48] Eternal purpose was that Christ would
[20:50] have a bride so when he designed Adam
[20:53] and Eve he designed Adam and Eve to be
[20:55] an expression of that we take the mind
[20:58] of Christ
[20:59] Adam had pre-existing Vision given to
[21:02] him by God that needs to be us we don't
[21:05] as men we don't come with our own Vision
[21:08] that's not
[21:09] manliness manliness is doing what Christ
[21:11] did and saying not my will father your
[21:15] will be done and then having the
[21:16] audacity to go and do
[21:19] it you know we we see depictions of
[21:23] Jesus and they sort of depict him as a
[21:26] little bit of a sissified person person
[21:28] he wasn't a sissified person he was a
[21:30] real strong man and he had the audacity
[21:36] to do what God I mean he walked into the
[21:38] temple with all the leaders and he
[21:40] braided whips and he whipped them and he
[21:43] shouted them down to not do what they
[21:45] were doing and if you go through what
[21:48] Jesus said how much of it is nice and
[21:51] sweet and how much of it is Harsh rebuke
[21:54] majority of it is Harsh speaking the
[21:57] truth into difficult circumstances and
[22:00] situations a real man a real man knows
[22:03] how to take the word in love and stand
[22:07] no matter what without fear of
[22:13] anything this is the pre-existing
[22:16] mission that God gave to Adam Genesis
[22:19] 1:26 that God said let us make man in
[22:21] our image after our likeness and let
[22:23] them have dominion over the fish of the
[22:25] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[22:26] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[22:28] and over over every creeping thing that
[22:29] creeps upon the Earth so God created man
[22:32] in his own image in the image of God
[22:33] created he him male and female created
[22:36] he them and God blessed them and God
[22:38] said unto them be fruitful and multiply
[22:40] and replenish the Earth and subdue it
[22:41] and have dominion over the fish of the
[22:43] sea over the follow of the air and over
[22:45] every living thing that moves upon the
[22:47] Earth all
[22:49] right so
[22:52] when God gave this
[22:54] commission this commission doesn't end
[22:59] it doesn't it doesn't
[23:01] change the gospel actually in itself is
[23:04] a connection to this missions go into
[23:07] all the world and preach the gospel we
[23:09] what are we doing we're preaching the
[23:11] gospel to bring them under the Dominion
[23:13] of Christ the lord and
[23:16] King and so that's directly connected
[23:19] but part of that is is your garden your
[23:23] home your family you're to take de a man
[23:26] is to take Dominion over
[23:29] everything over his family
[23:32] too right and he's to multiply he's to
[23:36] multiply the kingdom through his wife
[23:40] right so your your home is to be a
[23:43] kingdom multiplier it's not just where
[23:46] we have kids and raise them to do
[23:49] whatever we're multiplying the kingdom
[23:53] in our home and in our family and we're
[23:56] our that's the purp that's the driving
[23:58] purpose that's the driving vision of the
[24:01] family is to do what God said to do and
[24:06] to teach them to do what you're doing
[24:09] right to teach Sons to to have dominion
[24:13] to teach daughters to to know how to
[24:16] keep a home to know how to raise a
[24:19] family to know how to submit to her
[24:22] husband these are the things these are
[24:25] this is the vision that we have it's not
[24:27] just go to church
[24:29] uh enjoy the
[24:31] fellowship um listen to the preaching of
[24:33] the word I think sometimes we get so
[24:36] Rapture minded that we forget we're
[24:38] supposed to plant
[24:41] potatoes even the day before plant
[24:44] potatoes get married have
[24:47] children raise them to fear God with all
[24:50] your
[24:53] heart and the Lord God took the man and
[24:57] put him into the garden of Eden to dress
[24:59] it and to keep it you know that this is
[25:02] also your commission
[25:06] men no not the literal Garden of Eden
[25:10] but you have your own Garden of Eden to
[25:12] dress and keep and this is what we
[25:14] talked about before there's a general
[25:16] mission for every man amen every man
[25:21] there's no exceptions and as I said it's
[25:24] directly connected to the Great
[25:26] Commission that Jesus left with his
[25:29] Apostles that wasn't just for the
[25:31] apostles that wasn't just for the
[25:33] five-fold ministry that is for every
[25:36] single
[25:37] believer and it starts
[25:40] first not on the missions
[25:42] field in your house in your home with
[25:46] your children that's why being the
[25:49] qualifications of being a minister of
[25:51] the word is actually directly connected
[25:54] to your leadership of your home how
[25:57] should how you you can't take Dominion
[26:00] in a greater sense if you can't take
[26:02] dominion over your own home leader
[26:04] spiritual leadership over your own home
[26:07] so the word
[26:08] dress in Hebrew is Abad it means to work
[26:13] to serve to work for another to serve by
[26:15] labor to serve as subjects in other
[26:18] words your God has given you stewardship
[26:21] over the
[26:23] Earth he's given you the charge to take
[26:26] dominion over it as as the prophet
[26:29] called it you're to be small gods upon
[26:32] the Earth you're to be Lords upon the
[26:35] Earth to take Dominion not on your not
[26:37] your own will not your own purpose but
[26:40] as stewards as managers put in place
[26:43] there by God to do it the way he has
[26:45] designed and purposed to do it so that's
[26:48] to
[26:49] dress and to keep is Shamar A Primitive
[26:54] route properly to hedge about that is to
[26:56] guard G generally to protect to attend
[27:01] to so there you're you're to be a
[27:05] guardian that is directly connected to
[27:08] the work of a husband to be a guardian
[27:12] you are the guardian of your wife you
[27:15] are the guardian of your
[27:17] children they're under your headship and
[27:21] you are supposed to be their guard not
[27:23] just
[27:24] physically any person can guard them
[27:26] physically but there's not just one
[27:28] realm out here there's not just a
[27:30] Physical Realm there's a spiritual realm
[27:33] and here to be a guard both spiritually
[27:36] because there's a there's a demon power
[27:38] that entered into the serpent right
[27:42] there's a spiritual power that entered
[27:44] into the serpent to come and
[27:46] destroy man's
[27:49] Garden right and he perverted the garden
[27:52] and man let him do
[27:55] it he knew he wasn't deceived he knew
[27:57] what was happen happening but he he went
[27:59] and redeemed his wife but yet it was his
[28:02] responsibility to be sure that that
[28:04] didn't happen because it
[28:07] did every atom every Quark every proton
[28:11] every Neutron is under the
[28:13] curse that's our connected Duty when
[28:17] Adam failed in his duty everything that
[28:19] belonged to him what did it do it
[28:21] entered into the curse the curse would
[28:25] be the ground for your sake it wasn't
[28:26] just the ground it was everything
[28:28] everything everything was then subject
[28:30] to
[28:32] death and men if you if you fail to be
[28:36] the guardian of your family everything
[28:39] is subject to death just the same
[28:42] spiritual death if you surrender the
[28:44] guardianship of your family to your wife
[28:47] it's a mistake you can't do that you
[28:50] must do
[28:53] it all
[28:55] right Proverbs 22
[29:00] six train up a child in the way he
[29:02] should go and when he is old he will not
[29:04] depart from it this is not just a little
[29:08] means of I don't know what happened
[29:11] there let's
[29:14] see this isn't just a nice little thing
[29:17] that's sort of like a yeah we should do
[29:19] that this is integral to your family
[29:23] life this is actually your stated
[29:26] purpose
[29:28] it's not a secondary thing it's not
[29:29] something we could say well we got
[29:31] Public School here in America well go
[29:34] ahead and send them off to the devil
[29:36] send them off to the Communists and be
[29:38] surprised that they come back like
[29:40] little Communists that's not our job
[29:43] that's not our duty it's our personal
[29:46] Duty as parents in the sight of God to
[29:49] train up our children it's not our duty
[29:51] to send them off somewhere now you might
[29:54] do that people have gotten tutors people
[29:56] have done different things through
[29:57] history ultimately it is your job to
[30:01] train them up in the way they should go
[30:02] not only a spiritual way that they
[30:04] should go but a vision for what they
[30:06] should do for work how they should live
[30:08] their life you're supposed to show Sons
[30:11] how to take responsibility for their for
[30:14] their homes for families you're supposed
[30:16] to show direct them and help them
[30:18] understand what they should do for work
[30:21] in their life not only that and then for
[30:24] daughters you're supposed to point them
[30:25] to what the scripture says of how they
[30:27] should prepare themselves for life not
[30:30] the way America or Europe does it or the
[30:33] Middle East or Africa but the way the
[30:36] word says to do it what the apostles
[30:38] teach to do it that's how that's the
[30:42] direction we are to
[30:44] give let's look at Abraham and the Lord
[30:47] said this is the great time when the
[30:49] Lord and two angels came down in human
[30:52] flesh to meet with Abraham just before
[30:54] the destruction of Sodom and the Lord
[30:57] said shall I hide from Abraham that
[30:59] thing which
[31:00] I
[31:02] do seeing that Abraham shall surely
[31:05] become a great and mighty nation and all
[31:08] the nations of the Earth shall be
[31:09] blessed in him for I know him listen
[31:13] this is his reason because for because I
[31:17] know him he will command his children
[31:20] and his household after him and they
[31:22] shall keep the way of the Lord to do
[31:24] justice and judgment that the Lord may
[31:26] bring upon Abraham that which he has
[31:29] spoken of him so the L the Lord says I'm
[31:33] going to reveal my secret Mysteries to
[31:36] this man because he's not going to just
[31:39] keep it to himself he's going to teach
[31:41] and command his family after him amen
[31:46] and and we we we could see that in our
[31:48] own lives as we as we teach and speak of
[31:51] the word to others the word becomes
[31:53] revealed more and more to us and it's
[31:56] not it's a I I spoke about this last
[31:59] time it's not for us to merely rely on
[32:03] the ministry of the church to teach our
[32:06] children's spiritual
[32:08] things
[32:10] because we're the ones that are charged
[32:13] with the that
[32:14] responsibility we're not charged to drop
[32:17] them off at Sunday school I'm I'm all in
[32:20] favor of Sunday school but there's no
[32:21] verse in the Bible that even speaks
[32:23] about Sunday
[32:24] school it speaks about fathers
[32:28] speaks about
[32:29] dads teaching and training their family
[32:32] say I'm not a teacher
[32:35] well you are charged to teach and
[32:38] command your children it doesn't matter
[32:41] if you if you're not a teacher start
[32:42] doing it you'll get better at it you
[32:46] don't have to be a gifted Supernatural
[32:48] teacher to speak in the Pulpit but you
[32:51] can search and find the answers for
[32:54] yourself and you could pass that on to
[32:57] others that should be the duty of every
[33:00] father Yes get your children to church
[33:03] yes get them to Sunday school yes get
[33:05] them to youth
[33:07] camps no don't rely on that as the final
[33:10] story because I feel like you'll be
[33:12] sorely disappointed in the end that it
[33:15] won't achieve what you think it's going
[33:17] to achieve any of those other things
[33:20] being effective are are are effective
[33:23] because there's a dad in the home
[33:25] teaching the word that he's SP spending
[33:28] time with his children opening the
[33:30] scriptures going through the scriptures
[33:33] showing them the truth of the
[33:35] message it wouldn't be such a horrible
[33:37] problem of people walking away from the
[33:40] truth if we had more fathers in the home
[33:43] digging deeper in the word themselves
[33:46] and then passing that on to their
[33:48] children amen it's wonderful it's
[33:50] wonderful to have special devotions I
[33:53] think we should have that every day but
[33:55] it should go beyond that it should just
[33:57] be what we're talking about in the way
[33:59] when we're waking up when we're going to
[34:01] sleep when we're at the table these
[34:03] things it should be a passion in our
[34:05] heart as dads and I guess maybe as I
[34:08] leave uh the pulpit now I would say that
[34:13] it should be a passion in the hearts of
[34:15] dads to pass that on to their children
[34:18] and it should be such a passion that
[34:19] becomes infectious to them that you have
[34:22] a desire to bring the word to your to
[34:25] your children not just Doctrine but the
[34:28] life of the word that goes along with
[34:30] the true Doctrine bring that to your
[34:33] children so they have an understanding
[34:35] of the order of the home of the order of
[34:37] the word in our lives and how we're
[34:39] supposed to live digging deeper that's
[34:42] what all of our jobs are if you want if
[34:45] you want more Revelation I can tell you
[34:48] the reason why more Revelation came to
[34:50] Abraham was because God knew he would
[34:52] command his children after them so we
[34:54] can pray for more Revelation but we can
[34:57] also do what the word says and expect
[34:59] that more Revelation is going to come
[35:01] let's stand and
[35:05] pray Heavenly Father we just Look to You
[35:08] Lord we're so thankful for your goodness
[35:10] and mercy and Grace we ask that your
[35:12] Holy Spirit would be with us teaching us
[35:14] guiding us correcting us Lord today Lord
[35:17] may we enter into worship with all our
[35:18] hearts May each one of us get ourselves
[35:20] out of the way so that you can flow
[35:22] through us we ask in the name of Jesus
[35:24] Christ amen
[35:38] [Music]
