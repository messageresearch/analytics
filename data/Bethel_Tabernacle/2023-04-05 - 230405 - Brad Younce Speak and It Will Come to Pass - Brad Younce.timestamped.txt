[18:07] Love
[18:11] lifted me.
[18:15] I was blind,
[18:19] but now I see.
[18:24] You gave your life
[18:29] as a gift
[18:32] and you're the reason
[18:37] why I live.

[19:17] I will praise you all day through.
[19:24] And when the enemy should rise
[19:29] and the storms surround my life,
[19:33] I will praise you then too.
[19:41] Sometimes the storm is long
[19:44] and it feels like you're gone.
[19:49] And I wonder if I'll make it home.
[19:54] [Music]
[19:57] And I remember Lord, you never left me

[25:12] Felt like the

[25:17] here tonight. It's been a rough three
[25:20] days.
[25:22] But
[25:24] despite that, we're here to
[25:26] stomp on him.
[25:29] He may get us down,
[25:31] but we're not defeated.
[25:34] We might be down, but we're never out.

[26:19] Sometimes a preacher gets preached and
[26:20] they step on our toes and we can't quite
[26:22] say amen. But y'all blurt it out and
[26:25] make us feel bad.
[26:29] If you have your Bibles, let's turn to
[26:30] Mark chapter 11.
[26:32] [Music]
[26:35] verse 22- 24.
[26:46] And Jesus answered and saith unto them,
[26:49] "Have faith in God."
[26:50] Amen. For verily I say unto you, that
[26:53] who whosoever shall say unto this
[26:55] mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou
[26:58] cast into the sea, and shall not doubt
[27:01] in his heart, but shall believe that
[27:02] those things which he saith shall come
[27:04] to pass, he shall have whatsoever he
[27:07] saith.
[27:09] Therefore I say unto you, what things
[27:12] soever you desire when you pray, believe
[27:15] that you receive them, and ye shall have
[27:18] them.
[27:18] Amen. Let's let's go to him in prayer.
[27:23] Father, we always want to first thank
[27:25] you for the opportunity we have to come
[27:26] in this house, Lord. Father, I just
[27:29] pray, Lord, may your spirit would just
[27:31] come and may you just anoint
[27:34] the servant here, Lord. Father, I'm
[27:36] nobody, but God, you're somebody.
[27:40] Hallelujah.
[27:40] We depend upon you to come and speak to
[27:42] us, Lord. Father, I need special needs
[27:45] tonight, God. And Lord, I I come here
[27:48] even though I might be the one speaking,
[27:50] I'll be preaching to myself as well.
[27:51] Father, anoint their ears, Lord, to
[27:53] receive what's being placed before them.
[27:57] Father, we come hungry tonight. Lord, we
[27:59] come to the table and it's spread and
[28:00] it's ready for us to pull ourselves up
[28:02] and start eating. Lord, we place this
[28:06] service into your hands. Jesus name.
[28:08] Amen.
[28:09] You may be seated. for a uh title this
[28:13] evening. I want to speak on
[28:16] speak and it'll come to pass.
[28:20] You know, this story right here take
[28:21] place and some of the young people found
[28:23] out last week as we was going through
[28:26] the uh
[28:28] the final week of Jesus leading up to
[28:30] the crucifixion that this scripture
[28:32] right here took place on a Monday and a
[28:34] Tuesday.
[28:36] We know on Monday Jesus was hungry. So
[28:38] he's headed into the city and he's seen
[28:40] this fig tree and there was no fruit on
[28:42] it. So all he does he just he just
[28:46] cursed it. He's he seemed to be kind of
[28:48] aggravated that there was nothing there
[28:50] to eat.
[28:51] Jesus as a man. We find out this he went
[28:54] into the temple that same day and
[28:58] he started throwing making him a whip
[29:00] and started whooping the people.
[29:02] Whipping them people out of the church
[29:04] for your selling. Don't worry, I ain't
[29:06] got a whip tonight. And I'm not going to
[29:07] whip none of these out of here. But they
[29:11] somebody I think one of the young people
[29:12] I can't remember it might have been I
[29:14] don't know if it was brother Joe or
[29:15] somebody made a comment saying can you
[29:17] imagine all these people sitting over
[29:20] watching Jesus braid that whip
[29:23] and just sitting there looking at him
[29:26] like you're fixing to get it. Was that
[29:28] you sister Sharon?
[29:31] Can you imagine him looking at Jesus and
[29:33] says what is he going to do with that
[29:34] thing? And Jesus sitting there just
[29:35] looking at him like I'm coming after
[29:38] you. That's not the title. I just
[29:40] thought that when I read that.
[29:43] But the next day, you know, Peter
[29:45] noticed that the tree was dead.
[29:48] So, what happened to that tree? So Jesus
[29:50] just turns around and he just says,
[29:53] "Have faith in God."
[29:57] You know, Hebrews 11:1 that faith is the
[29:59] substance of things hoped for, the
[30:01] evidence of things not seen. So what are
[30:03] you hoping for?
[30:07] You will see your faith will bring down
[30:09] a promise.
[30:11] Jesus just turns and says, "Have faith
[30:13] in God. For verily I say unto you that
[30:15] whosoever thou say unto this mountain,
[30:18] which is the Mount of Olives, and be
[30:20] thou removed, be thou cast into the sea,
[30:23] which is the Sea of Galilee,"
[30:25] it was many miles away.
[30:29] They were sitting there like Mount of
[30:30] the Mount of Olives is just right here
[30:32] over Jerusalem. But Jesus said, "If you
[30:33] have the faith, you can speak to that
[30:35] mountain and that mountain can just be
[30:37] picked up right out of the ground and
[30:39] dropped into the sea."
[30:40] Amen.
[30:42] And you shall not doubt in his heart,
[30:44] but shall believe that these those
[30:47] things which he saith
[30:49] shall come to pass. And he shall have
[30:53] whatsoever
[30:55] he saith.
[30:56] The passive power of the spoken word.
[30:59] You We're living in the age of the
[31:01] spoken word. Brother said in life
[31:04] Jesus said have faith in God for if you
[31:08] would say to this mountain be moved
[31:11] don't doubt but believe that what ye say
[31:14] shall come to pass you shall have what
[31:16] you say when you pray believe
[31:20] amen
[31:21] that you receive what you ask for and
[31:24] you shall have it
[31:26] he says I he says see we after receiving
[31:30] the spirit of God. And I like the way he
[31:32] he places this. You receive the spirit
[31:35] of God. God made the world out of
[31:38] nothing. It's just his word. He just
[31:42] created it.
[31:44] His word is creation. So he just spoke
[31:47] it. And the word world was created
[31:50] because it was an object in God's mind
[31:52] in his heart. He just spoke it.
[31:56] Hallelujah. And it come into existence.
[31:59] He was a creator.
[32:02] Then
[32:04] if we have Zoey,
[32:06] God's life in us,
[32:10] we become sons of God, amateur creators.
[32:15] Cuz he said, "Whatsoever you say,
[32:20] believe that what you say shall you
[32:22] shall have."
[32:25] Amen.
[32:27] We can leave right now.
[32:29] and take that quote right there and just
[32:32] be victorious.
[32:36] And brother says, I've noticed that a
[32:38] lot of times I'd say things that I
[32:40] couldn't hardly think myself, but I
[32:43] would say it anyhow.
[32:46] And I come to find out it did happen
[32:49] just that way. I'd say things I didn't
[32:52] hardly mean for it to happen that way,
[32:54] but it did anyhow because I had said it.
[32:58] He says, "I saw, wait a minute,
[33:02] you see when we speak something,
[33:05] if something is anchored to us,
[33:09] we shouldn't." He says, "You should
[33:11] never speak it till you believe it."
[33:14] Then when we believe it, we speak it.
[33:17] And that creative word goes out. It's a
[33:21] part of God and it creates.
[33:24] Hallelujah. That same voice that stood
[33:27] back there in the eternities and said,
[33:29] "Let there be light
[33:31] is that same one is down on the inside
[33:34] of you tonight."
[33:37] When it speaks, something is going to
[33:40] happen.
[33:41] Hallelujah.
[33:43] Just say
[33:49] here,
[33:52] the anointing
[33:55] It finally got here.
[33:58] I was back in the back office said,
[33:59] "Lord, where you at?"
[34:01] Because a lot of times he'll just he'll
[34:02] still show up back here.
[34:05] I'm going. You said you'd be there.
[34:07] So whatever you're say, you have a
[34:10] sickness, say, "I'm healed."
[34:13] Amen.
[34:16] You need deliverance of something, just
[34:18] say it.
[34:21] You have a financial need, just say it.
[34:23] That's right.
[34:26] Amen.
[34:27] Do we ever believe that?
[34:29] Do you believe if you have a bill you're
[34:31] supposed to pay tomorrow and there's no
[34:34] money,
[34:35] can you have the faith to say, "I'm
[34:37] going to write a check on that."
[34:41] I tried that one time.
[34:49] I didn't have enough faith.
[34:54] That check bounced everywhere.
[34:59] But if you have that kind of faith that
[35:02] whatever you say will come to pass, it
[35:05] don't matter if it is electric bill you
[35:07] got due tomorrow.
[35:10] We got to have that. I'm preaching to
[35:11] myself.
[35:12] We got to have that. I don't have
[35:14] electric bill due tomorrow, but but
[35:17] whatever it is, what do you have need
[35:19] of?
[35:20] Just say it. Speak. And it was going to
[35:23] come to pass. We sitting around. Why
[35:26] cry?
[35:27] That's what God told Moses. What are you
[35:29] doing crying up here for?
[35:31] Speak.
[35:33] That's what Moses did. He spoke and the
[35:35] Red Sea opened up.
[35:38] Joshua was in a battle.
[35:41] He He knew it was getting close to dark.
[35:43] He knew if if it got dark, the the enemy
[35:45] will they'll regroup
[35:47] and be stronger in the morning. So all
[35:50] all he did was say, "Son, stand still.
[35:53] Moon stand still
[35:56] and it did it." That was a man without
[35:58] the Holy Ghost.
[36:00] What would it be if each one of us with
[36:02] the Holy Ghost? What could we say?
[36:05] Amen.
[36:06] What can we say will happen? Jesus is
[36:09] saying, "Ask me for big things."
[36:11] Amen.
[36:13] A mountain's a pretty big thing.
[36:16] So if you got a mountain standing in
[36:17] your way,
[36:18] go ahead and speak it.
[36:24] Have the faith of God.
[36:28] Our faith won't move nothing.
[36:30] That's right.
[36:31] Our own faith can't even heal a
[36:32] toothache.
[36:35] I've tried.
[36:37] It didn't work.
[36:39] Tylenol and ibuprofen did until you
[36:42] started believing. You started speaking
[36:43] and healing came forth.
[36:47] Brother says, "Don't never be afraid to
[36:48] ask for big things."
[36:50] God just wants you to. He wants you to
[36:52] ask big things. He don't want you to be
[36:54] a little petty and juvenile. He wants
[36:56] you to ask big things that your joys may
[36:58] be full.
[37:00] Are you down a little low on joy
[37:02] tonight?
[37:03] God, I need it.
[37:05] I'm speaking it.
[37:07] Restore them joy of my salvation.
[37:11] Oh, but we live so far beneath our
[37:13] privileges.
[37:15] We
[37:18] The Bible's so full of promises.
[37:22] Promises of healing, promise of
[37:24] deliverance, promises of salvation.
[37:29] But we're not going to receive anything.
[37:30] We just come to church.
[37:32] Come on,
[37:34] have our arms folded. folded sit down
[37:36] says, "I've had a rough day, God.
[37:40] Preacher, bless me."
[37:46] That's what we've done.
[37:49] That's what we've done. Each one of us
[37:51] has come in here like that. We're so
[37:52] tired. We expect the preacher to do all
[37:54] the work.
[37:57] Guilty.
[38:00] Hallelujah.
[38:02] But it's all we do. Just sit around and
[38:03] cry.
[38:06] God don't love me.
[38:09] Oh, pitiful. That's pitiful.
[38:12] How you say God don't love you for what
[38:14] he had done for you. Step down out of
[38:16] throne of glory to come upon earth for
[38:18] you.
[38:19] God don't love me. That should even be
[38:22] in our vocabulary.
[38:25] Hallelujah. We just can't sit here
[38:27] expect God to just drop it into your
[38:29] laps.
[38:31] God, you know what I have need of. Yes,
[38:32] he does. Amen. Amen.
[38:34] But he might just be waiting for you to
[38:36] ask.
[38:41] Whatever you have need of, ask it. God
[38:44] wants to give you the desire of your
[38:45] heart.
[38:46] All you got to do is just open up to
[38:48] him.
[38:48] Amen.
[38:51] It's hard to do.
[38:54] You're a special people.
[38:55] That's right.
[38:57] For ordained. God chose you over the
[39:00] Baptist. Hallelujah.
[39:02] God chose you over the Catholics.
[39:04] God even chose you over some so-called
[39:06] message people.
[39:08] You're a special breed.
[39:11] So what's God going to give you just
[39:12] because you are special? He wants you to
[39:14] open up to him. Psalms 81:10 says, "I am
[39:17] the Lord thy God, which brought thee out
[39:19] of the land of Egypt. Open thy mouth
[39:23] wide and I will fill it."
[39:26] Amen. Amen.
[39:27] God's telling the church, "I brought you
[39:29] out of Egypt.
[39:31] I'm the one that did it. It wasn't
[39:33] Moses.
[39:35] Moses by itself couldn't do nothing.
[39:38] [Music]
[39:39] It ain't your pastor.
[39:41] It's not me or the rest of these little
[39:42] brothers. We can't fill it up. It only
[39:46] takes God to do that for you. So just
[39:47] open up your mouth. What do you have
[39:50] need of?" It's like a little bird in a
[39:51] nest. Yeah.
[39:53] Mother bird goes there and picks up a
[39:54] worm, flies over the nest. All them
[39:57] little mouths. You know,
[40:02] whoever's got their mouth open is going
[40:04] to get the worm.
[40:07] Whoever's got your mouth open tonight,
[40:08] God's going to come and feel it.
[40:11] That's right.
[40:14] Lord have mercy. We can preach on that
[40:16] for a while.
[40:18] That's what we need to do today. you
[40:21] come to church, just open up your mouth.
[40:24] God says, "I'll give you what you have
[40:26] need of." You know, when you feed your
[40:28] babies,
[40:30] the only way you get them to open their
[40:31] mouth to act like it's an airplane
[40:35] all their mouth just open up.
[40:38] That's what God's doing when he sends a
[40:39] preacher up here.
[40:42] We got We got a spoonful of stuff.
[40:46] We're going through the building. Open
[40:48] up.
[40:50] Hallelujah. God sweeping through the
[40:52] building says, "Open your mouth. I want
[40:54] to give you what you have need of. Open
[40:56] your mouth. Say, Lord, I need healing.
[41:00] Lord, I need deliverance."
[41:03] Glory to God. John 14:12,
[41:07] verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[41:10] believeth on me, the works that I do
[41:13] shall he do also,
[41:16] and greater works
[41:18] than these shall he do.
[41:22] Whatsoever ye ask in my name,
[41:25] Amen.
[41:26] Amen.
[41:27] I might do it.
[41:31] No, don't say that. Whatsoever ye shall
[41:35] ask in my name, that will I do.
[41:43] Amen.
[41:44] You got a lost family member.
[41:49] Come on.
[41:50] If you shall ask anything in my name, I
[41:54] will do it.
[41:56] It don't matter what it is. It don't
[41:59] matter how big and how small you think
[42:02] it is. Nothing's too great for my God.
[42:06] Hallelujah. If ye abide, John 15:7, if
[42:10] ye abide in me, secret,
[42:13] and my words abide in you,
[42:17] not everybody's like this.
[42:20] People come to church, a lot There's a
[42:22] lot of people not like that. Right.
[42:25] If ye abide in me and I abide in you,
[42:31] ye shall ask what ye will,
[42:35] and it shall be done unto you.
[42:37] Hallelujah.
[42:39] John 16:23, in that day you shall ask me
[42:43] nothing, for verily, verily, I say unto
[42:46] you, whatsoever you shall ask the Father
[42:49] in my name, he will give it to you.
[42:52] Amen.
[42:54] Amen.
[42:55] Hither too have you asked nothing in my
[42:57] name.
[42:59] Just ask and you shall receive that your
[43:02] joys may be full
[43:04] in the na in his name. Anything can
[43:06] happen.
[43:08] We know. We know what happens when his
[43:10] name spoke.
[43:12] What happened to John the Baptist?
[43:15] I love that. I I'll miss every time I
[43:17] preach.
[43:19] Dead in a womb.
[43:22] But when Mary came and spoke the name
[43:24] Jesus, the first time his name was
[43:27] mentioned,
[43:29] a dead baby who I should say a baby who
[43:32] had been dead came to life.
[43:36] That was like we were.
[43:38] Amen.
[43:40] We might have been on some barroom
[43:42] somewhere.
[43:43] We might have been surfing some ocean
[43:45] somewhere.
[43:49] I don't have to say no names.
[43:53] You might even be sitting in a church
[43:54] pew.
[43:56] Dead.
[43:58] Dead man walking.
[44:01] They make these movies about dead men
[44:04] walking.
[44:06] I'm looking at some original dead men
[44:08] walking.
[44:09] You were walking dead men.
[44:12] But one day you heard the name Jesus
[44:14] Christ.
[44:16] What happened next?
[44:18] Life was spoken to you.
[44:21] Hallelujah.
[44:22] Lord,
[44:23] what's the brother? Say, "What's the
[44:24] matter with Christian? We're just
[44:25] wishy-washy, half jellyfish."
[44:28] Get a backbone in you and stand up for
[44:30] God
[44:31] and watch right.
[44:33] Stand for what the Bible says and
[44:35] believe it with all your heart
[44:36] in that name of Jesus Christ. It brought
[44:39] life to a dead baby
[44:41] the first time it was ever spoken. It
[44:43] ought to heal every sick person. Every
[44:46] person is bound by the devil.
[44:50] That's right.
[44:52] Just speak in his name. So what do you
[44:54] have need of in the name of Jesus?
[44:59] He gives us the scripture. Ask anything
[45:01] in my name and he's going to do it.
[45:03] Speak his name over your family.
[45:06] Speak his name over that depression
[45:08] demon.
[45:10] Speak his name over that homosexual
[45:11] demon.
[45:13] Speak his name over that suicidal demon.
[45:18] Speak the name Jesus Christ and watch
[45:20] what happens.
[45:24] Every demon of hell is defeated.
[45:30] How many hates him?
[45:34] Just two of you.
[45:38] Hallelujah.
[45:40] God just wants you to ask. He's just
[45:43] waiting on it.
[45:44] Ephesians 3:16
[45:47] that he would grant you according to the
[45:50] riches which is abundance of his glory
[45:54] to be strengthened with might by his
[45:56] spirit holy ghost in the inner man that
[46:01] Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith
[46:05] that ye being rooted and grounded
[46:09] that's our foundation and it's stable
[46:12] grounded in love may be able to
[46:15] comprehend with all saints what is the
[46:18] breadth, the length, the depth, and the
[46:21] height.
[46:23] We're talking about the love of God.
[46:29] Together with all of God's people may
[46:31] have the power to understand how broad
[46:34] and how long and how high and how deep
[46:38] is the love of God.
[46:42] and to know that the love of Christ
[46:44] which passes knowledge that ye might be
[46:48] filled with all fullness
[46:53] of God. Fill up. It's abundance.
[46:57] Remember that word abundance.
[47:01] That's what the fullness is. He wants us
[47:03] to have to know that he has an abundance
[47:06] of joy, abundance of peace, abundance of
[47:09] grace, abundance of life,
[47:12] on and on and on.
[47:15] But just to know that God's love goes
[47:18] past just knowing him.
[47:21] Just to be filled with the fullness of
[47:24] God, cuz greater is he that is in you.
[47:29] Want to quote? Okay.
[47:33] So he that's in you is greater than he
[47:36] that's in the world. God in you like he
[47:38] was Jesus Christ.
[47:39] Amen.
[47:40] Oh, we've heard this. We've heard this
[47:42] over and over.
[47:43] All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[47:46] And all that Christ was, he's poured it
[47:48] into the church.
[47:51] What's that make you not co-equal with
[47:53] God?
[47:55] That gives us right to say whatever we
[47:57] want,
[47:58] speak whatever we want. It's going to
[48:00] come to pass.
[48:03] And when he spoke, it was God speaking
[48:06] through human lips.
[48:08] No one obeyed him.
[48:14] Hallelujah. Cuz he said that to Lazarus
[48:16] after being dead and stink in four days.
[48:18] His face and nose that fell in. Lazarus,
[48:21] come forth.
[48:24] I always love it. Brother said, "If he
[48:26] hadn't spoke the name Lazarus, every
[48:28] person that died from beginning of
[48:30] creation till then would have got up out
[48:32] of the grave."
[48:36] When he comes forth the resurrection,
[48:37] rapture morning, he's only going to say
[48:40] one name.
[48:41] It's not going to be Chris or Steve or
[48:44] it's going to be bride.
[48:48] And everybody's bride. It don't matter
[48:49] if you were dead, you're raising up.
[48:54] We alive and remain. We shall call our
[48:57] own bodies from the dust of the earth.
[49:00] That's a spoken word.
[49:04] Ephesians 3:20. Now unto him that is
[49:06] able to do exceedingly abundant
[49:11] beyond measure. That's abundantly beyond
[49:14] measure you have an advantage.
[49:17] Glory to God. exceeding abundant above,
[49:21] exceeding some number
[49:24] or measure.
[49:26] Over and above.
[49:29] While you're looking at scripture, just
[49:30] think of this.
[49:33] Over and above,
[49:35] superior, extraordinary, surpassing,
[49:38] uncommon,
[49:42] super abundant.
[49:44] He's just not simply able to do whatever
[49:46] we need for him to do.
[49:51] But he is more than able to a very great
[49:55] degree overflowing excessively.
[49:58] Amen.
[50:00] He is able to go profoundly above even
[50:04] our highest expectations.
[50:08] Amen.
[50:10] If we pray in faith,
[50:14] in his will, yielded to his power.
[50:18] So it's never too big to ask of him.
[50:21] Amen.
[50:22] Now unto him that is able to do
[50:24] exceedingly abundant above all that we
[50:26] ask.
[50:27] That's right. Amen.
[50:28] To ask simple to think.
[50:32] Glory to perceive with the mind. to
[50:36] understand,
[50:40] to have understanding, to think upon,
[50:43] ponder, or consider.
[50:48] Isaiah 65:24 said, "It shall come to
[50:51] pass that before they call, I will
[50:53] answer."
[50:54] And while they are yet speaking, I will
[50:57] hear. That's right.
[50:59] Now unto him that is able to do
[51:01] exceedingly abundant above all that we
[51:03] ask or think according to the power.
[51:07] Amen.
[51:08] Strength.
[51:10] Ability.
[51:12] You got ability.
[51:15] I love this one. Power for performing
[51:19] miracles.
[51:22] Amen. Above all that we ask or think
[51:27] according to the power that workketh in
[51:31] us.
[51:34] Amen.
[51:35] I'm going to say it again. In us we have
[51:38] powers to perform miracles.
[51:44] They shall lay hands on the sick and
[51:45] they shall recover. Right.
[51:51] When God has given us abundant,
[51:53] exceedingly abundant blessings, still we
[51:56] ask for more, and he's able to give it
[52:01] or do for us for whatever we ask, but we
[52:04] may think of more even than we have
[52:06] asked.
[52:09] We may think of more even than what we
[52:13] have asked. And he is able to do this
[52:15] also.
[52:19] Whatever you ask or think,
[52:22] he will do it.
[52:24] Hallelujah.
[52:25] Amen.
[52:27] He is able to do much more than we all
[52:30] ask or even imagine.
[52:34] Amen.
[52:35] Is this okay?
[52:38] I'm easy on the video, people.
[52:41] I'm not moving.
[52:45] It's him in us.
[52:49] His power working in us
[52:53] able to do much more than what we asked
[52:56] for. Are we getting it
[52:58] or think of?
[53:00] So what is that power in you?
[53:04] It's the power of the Holy Ghost.
[53:07] God living in your hearts.
[53:10] So whatever you say it's going to come
[53:12] to pass
[53:15] according to the power that workketh in
[53:18] us. Meaning that the spirit of God who
[53:21] is the finger and power of God who
[53:25] begins and carry on will finish the work
[53:28] in you.
[53:31] 1 Corinthians 2:9 says, "But it is
[53:33] written, eyes have not seen, nor ears
[53:35] have heard,
[53:36] neither have entered the heart of man
[53:38] the things which God has prepared for
[53:40] them that love him."
[53:44] We can be like Elisha,
[53:47] you know, he wanted the double portion
[53:49] when it come time across the Jordan
[53:51] River. He said, "I Elijah said, "You
[53:54] stay here." Nope. I'm going with you.
[53:57] What would have happened if Elisha just
[53:58] stayed over there?
[54:02] He just been a normal prophet,
[54:06] but he had enough to know I've got to go
[54:08] over with you. So, I'm going with you.
[54:14] What do you want, Elisha? I want a
[54:16] double portion of your spirit.
[54:20] What do you want, Brother Luther? You
[54:22] want I want a You want a double portion
[54:24] of his spirit.
[54:25] I do.
[54:28] Amen. Okay. If you see me when I go up,
[54:32] it'll be so.
[54:34] Here goes Elijah. I see you. Down comes
[54:36] the mantel. G.
[54:38] Elisha goes over and picks it up, puts
[54:40] it on.
[54:42] Don't feel no different.
[54:44] I'm just wearing Elijah's coat. But he
[54:47] knew the difference when he got back
[54:48] down to the Jordan River.
[54:49] How am I going to cross that thing?
[54:53] He just takes it back off and says,
[54:54] "Where is the God of Elijah?" and smoke
[54:57] it and the Jordan opened up.
[55:02] You got a Jordan in front of you.
[55:08] Hallelujah. Don't be afraid.
[55:12] James 4:2 says, "Ye lust and have not.
[55:16] You kill, desire to have, and can
[55:17] obtain. You fight in war, yet you have
[55:19] not because you ask not."
[55:24] That's just simple. Yeah,
[55:25] you ask and receive not because you ask
[55:28] a miss. He just tells him you don't get
[55:31] it because you don't ask. But when you
[55:32] do ask, you ask a miss.
[55:34] Lord, give me a million dollars.
[55:40] I think that's asking a miss.
[55:44] Glory.
[55:45] First John 5:14. And this is a
[55:47] confidence that we have in him that if
[55:50] we ask anything according to his will.
[55:53] Yes. Amen. Right?
[55:56] He will hear us.
[55:57] Amen.
[55:58] Hallelujah. And if we know that he hears
[56:00] us and whatsoever we ask, we know that
[56:04] we have the petitions that we desired of
[56:06] him.
[56:10] That's how important you are.
[56:13] That's why you could ask for big things.
[56:17] I love this. I think I've probably read
[56:20] it before. Lamb's book of life.
[56:22] This is why you're special. Jesus was
[56:25] slain before the world even had the
[56:27] first speck of dirt laid on it. Jesus
[56:30] was already slain. Why? Because God, he
[56:33] said, "Here it is."
[56:35] God by fornowledge when he was in he was
[56:38] the word in the beginning, he perceived
[56:40] a thought
[56:42] and when he has spoke it and said it
[56:44] shall be, Jesus was slain.
[56:48] The very minute God spoke the word.
[56:52] Jesus not was slain on Friday. Good
[56:54] Friday.
[56:56] Amen.
[56:58] He was slain before the foundation of
[57:00] the world.
[57:02] 4,000 years later, he came and paid that
[57:05] price.
[57:07] Hallelujah. That God already back there
[57:10] by his word. He had to come. All devils
[57:14] in hell couldn't keep him from coming.
[57:19] God had already spoke it. Right.
[57:23] So when God spoke your name before the
[57:25] foundation of the world, he wrote your
[57:27] name right beside
[57:30] Jesus's name.
[57:36] Oh, we're doing good.
[57:39] From before the foundation of the world,
[57:41] God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book
[57:43] of Life, and all the devils out of hell
[57:46] can't erase it.
[57:49] God's word had done spoke it. That's
[57:51] right.
[57:55] Why do we walk around with our heads
[57:56] down
[57:59] when a God could speak
[58:01] and create all that out there?
[58:03] Yeah.
[58:05] Light years and how many far how many
[58:08] millions and trillions and zillions or
[58:09] whatever does it go out there stars that
[58:12] God with the spoken word created it.
[58:16] Amen.
[58:17] And we walk around with our head down.
[58:23] my knee. God, there's no way.
[58:27] Lord have mercy on us all.
[58:32] You were here before there was a devil.
[58:38] We believe it.
[58:42] I know. We'll be here when he's gone.
[58:44] Amen.
[58:47] Hallelujah.
[58:48] You have firstborn privileges.
[58:51] Hebrews 12:22.
[58:54] But ye can come into Mount Zion to the
[58:56] city of the living God, the heavenly
[58:58] Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of
[59:00] angels, to the general assembly and
[59:04] church of the firstborn, which are
[59:06] written in heaven, to God the judge of
[59:09] all, and to the spirits of just men made
[59:12] perfect.
[59:14] You sit here tonight with the same
[59:16] rights as Jesus Christ.
[59:20] Do we have the faith? Firstborn rights.
[59:24] We're not stepchildren.
[59:28] Amen.
[59:28] We're not little redheaded stepchildren.
[59:31] You know, I'm going to beat you like a
[59:32] little redheaded stepchild.
[59:34] We're not that.
[59:40] We are the children of God.
[59:42] Whatever we say is gonna happen.
[59:49] Hallelujah.
[59:51] Are you getting it?
[59:55] Cuz you know when you got saved and got
[59:56] the Holy Ghost, God gave you a
[59:57] checkbook,
[1:00:00] right?
[1:00:03] I like checkbooks.
[1:00:09] When God saves a man, he gives him a
[1:00:11] whole big checkbook. At the bottom, it's
[1:00:13] got everything. The name of Jesus.
[1:00:18] Hallelujah. It's got At the bottom, it's
[1:00:22] got everything. The name of Jesus.
[1:00:25] Hallelujah.
[1:00:28] Why didn't I see that before?
[1:00:31] Glory to God. So, that's when you say,
[1:00:33] "Whatever you ask in my name, I'm going
[1:00:35] to do it."
[1:00:37] Abraham's seed believes that.
[1:00:38] Yes. Amen.
[1:00:40] Are we Abraham's seed?
[1:00:42] Do you believe that?
[1:00:44] Yes, sir.
[1:00:45] Hallelujah.
[1:00:47] The deposit's already made. It's in the
[1:00:49] bank.
[1:00:50] Hallelujah.
[1:00:51] Christ was the one that put the deposit
[1:00:53] there.
[1:00:55] The deposit's in the bank.
[1:00:58] Then don't be afraid to write out a
[1:01:00] check.
[1:01:01] Amen.
[1:01:02] The bank will pay it off. The bank of
[1:01:04] heaven will pay off every check.
[1:01:07] Yeah.
[1:01:09] Yes, sir. He says,
[1:01:12] "Hallelujah."
[1:01:16] Mark 11:24 says, "Therefore, I say unto
[1:01:18] you, what things soever ye desire when
[1:01:22] you pray,
[1:01:24] believe
[1:01:26] that you receive them, and ye shall have
[1:01:30] them."
[1:01:32] What do you have need of?
[1:01:36] You can say a bunch of I can stand here
[1:01:37] and say all kinds, but only you know
[1:01:39] what you have need of.
[1:01:42] How can we get it across?
[1:01:44] I'm speaking to myself. How can I ever
[1:01:48] trust a God when I don't want to put his
[1:01:49] actions into work? Say, God, I need
[1:01:53] this.
[1:01:54] Boom. There it is.
[1:01:58] We should have the faith to go speak a
[1:02:00] world into existence and go live on it.
[1:02:04] If God gave us that power, this church
[1:02:06] would be empty tonight.
[1:02:12] Be honest.
[1:02:16] Brother Joe's the only honest one here.
[1:02:20] Don't you like nobody here, Brother Joe?
[1:02:28] Brother Brandon was warned that a trap
[1:02:29] was going to be set for him.
[1:02:34] We know the story
[1:02:36] where God warned him there's a trap set
[1:02:38] for you. You need to be careful.
[1:02:40] So, Brother Ram just tells everybody,
[1:02:42] "There's a trap set for me."
[1:02:45] He didn't realize there's going to be
[1:02:46] two young people sitting on the front
[1:02:47] row,
[1:02:49] kissing and doing whatever the hell they
[1:02:51] doing. And brother Ram kept saying to
[1:02:52] him, "You need to stop that. You need to
[1:02:55] be reverent. You're in the house of
[1:02:56] God."
[1:02:59] They just kept on doing it.
[1:03:03] And God just spoke to brother Bra says,
[1:03:04] "Whatever you say
[1:03:08] will come to pass.
[1:03:11] Blindness,
[1:03:12] they could die, be crippled,
[1:03:15] or whatever. Whatever you say, Brother
[1:03:17] Brandham, is what's going to happen."
[1:03:22] Abraham said,
[1:03:26] he says, "Something said to me, say what
[1:03:27] you will and it'll be done." I stood
[1:03:28] there. Something said, "Say blindness,
[1:03:30] it'll be blind. Say death and they'll
[1:03:32] pack them out. Say what you will."
[1:03:36] He says, "I couldn't speak. I couldn't
[1:03:39] move. It just left. I thought, God, what
[1:03:41] must I do?" And I turned and he stood
[1:03:45] there, his face white, talking to the
[1:03:48] boy, looking at me.
[1:03:51] Then I turned and looked at him before I
[1:03:54] knowed what I said. I said, 'I forgive
[1:03:56] you of your act.
[1:03:59] And it must have been just the right
[1:04:01] thing to say. It was God trying a
[1:04:05] reaction on an action
[1:04:08] that night. He said it was revealed to
[1:04:10] me that I had said the right thing
[1:04:13] and I know it was all leading up to
[1:04:15] something. But what was it?
[1:04:19] Then he says, "After this, I began to
[1:04:21] notice
[1:04:22] the different things that I would speak
[1:04:26] out unconsciously,
[1:04:28] not knowing what I said." And it would
[1:04:31] happen that way.
[1:04:33] And I begin to speak about it.
[1:04:39] We've done that.
[1:04:40] Sure.
[1:04:42] I'll be getting feeling like I'm getting
[1:04:44] sick
[1:04:45] and I'll sit there say, "Devil, I don't
[1:04:47] have time for that."
[1:04:50] You go back to bed and you realize, "Oh,
[1:04:52] I feel pretty good."
[1:04:55] Simple as that.
[1:04:57] Just speak it.
[1:05:00] Hallelujah. Glory to God. You just say
[1:05:02] it. Whatever you have, whatever you say,
[1:05:05] I'm going to repeat it. You have a
[1:05:07] sickness, say, "I'm healed."
[1:05:10] You're waiting on a report from a
[1:05:12] doctor.
[1:05:13] Go ahead and say it tonight. I'm healed.
[1:05:16] Don't matter what the doctor says.
[1:05:19] Amen.
[1:05:20] Hallelujah.
[1:05:21] You want your family restored? Just say
[1:05:24] it.
[1:05:25] Amen.
[1:05:26] We all have lost loved ones.
[1:05:28] Amen.
[1:05:29] Just say it.
[1:05:31] Glory to God.
[1:05:32] Cuz Jesus said, "All power of heaven and
[1:05:35] earth is given to me."
[1:05:38] So where did it go?
[1:05:44] All that God was important to Christ.
[1:05:45] All the Christ was important to the
[1:05:46] church. So where did that power go?
[1:05:52] That's right.
[1:05:54] Brother Ram said
[1:05:56] in the church age book, don't fear John
[1:05:59] Little Flock. I I all that I am, you are
[1:06:03] heir to. All my power is yours. My
[1:06:07] omnipotence is yours as I stand in your
[1:06:11] midst.
[1:06:12] Amen.
[1:06:14] He said, I have not come to bring fear
[1:06:15] or failure, but love and courage and
[1:06:18] ability.
[1:06:20] All power is given unto me
[1:06:23] and is yours to use.
[1:06:31] Amen.
[1:06:33] Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:06:36] He said, "You speak the word and I will
[1:06:41] perform it."
[1:06:46] Have faith of God.
[1:06:49] Wow.
[1:06:51] You speak the word and I will perform
[1:06:53] it. That is my covenant.
[1:06:56] It can never fail.
[1:07:00] Amen. It might look like it.
[1:07:03] It might look like someday it will fail.
[1:07:08] Whatever you say.
[1:07:10] I'm not going to go into this because
[1:07:12] brother Jason has done a great job at
[1:07:13] it. Where brother Brown was faced with
[1:07:15] these opportunities in his life when he
[1:07:17] spoke squirrels into existence.
[1:07:20] Where there was nothing, there was a
[1:07:22] squirrel.
[1:07:23] Amen.
[1:07:24] Let there be.
[1:07:26] Let there be. And there was. It's going
[1:07:29] to come this way. It was. It's coming
[1:07:31] this way. And it was him speaking it.
[1:07:36] I've tried that before.
[1:07:38] Oh yeah. Amen.
[1:07:47] It didn't work.
[1:07:50] But it should if we had that much faith.
[1:07:53] That's right.
[1:07:55] We're not supposed to speak squirrels
[1:07:56] into existence.
[1:07:57] But I can speak healing to your body.
[1:08:01] Glory.
[1:08:03] Woo. Hallelujah. You know, remember the
[1:08:05] story he was telling us about had he
[1:08:07] write.
[1:08:09] Remember I said, "Speak to the
[1:08:10] mountain." And if you had heard speak to
[1:08:13] this mountain lately, go listen to it.
[1:08:18] The only thing I could think it would be
[1:08:20] this. When God was trying to tell
[1:08:21] Abraham how he was going to bless him,
[1:08:26] I said, "It is to be my new ministry. is
[1:08:28] coming in something greater that he will
[1:08:29] finally confirm in that little building.
[1:08:32] If it be that like Abraham vice
[1:08:36] instead of his son
[1:08:38] in Genesis it said then when God held
[1:08:41] his hand from sacrificing his son there
[1:08:44] was a ram there.
[1:08:50] Abraham needed something.
[1:08:51] Yes he did.
[1:08:52] Abraham spoke of faith. You all stay
[1:08:55] here. Me and the lad's going up and me
[1:08:58] and the lad are going to return.
[1:09:02] He spoke it, didn't he?
[1:09:04] I'm going to go to church tonight. I
[1:09:07] have a need and God's going to going to
[1:09:09] do it and I'm going to walk back out of
[1:09:11] there with that need gone with God
[1:09:14] fulfilling whatever he said he's going
[1:09:16] to do.
[1:09:20] Wow.
[1:09:22] You said, "Well, how'd that ram get up
[1:09:24] there?
[1:09:26] A wild beast would have killed it.
[1:09:29] Where'd it come from? He said that's the
[1:09:32] reason Abraham called the name of the
[1:09:33] place Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will
[1:09:35] provide himself a sacrifice. He is able
[1:09:38] to speak it into existence.
[1:09:44] Then that same Jehovah Gyra, I was in
[1:09:46] need of a squirrel one time. The same as
[1:09:49] he was in need of a ram. And I believe
[1:09:51] Jehovah Gyra placed it right there by
[1:09:54] the same spoken word.
[1:09:57] It wasn't me anyhow because I didn't I
[1:10:00] didn't even know what I was saying. He
[1:10:03] said it
[1:10:04] himself.
[1:10:07] And little Hattie said the right word.
[1:10:10] She said there's no that's nothing but
[1:10:12] the truth.
[1:10:15] The atmosphere changed.
[1:10:18] That room felt like it was coming apart.
[1:10:21] And the Holy Spirit, the same voice that
[1:10:24] spoke about the squirrels and said,
[1:10:25] "Give her what she asked for."
[1:10:29] Sister Haddie as a witness before God,
[1:10:31] this is it.
[1:10:33] If there if there is a any doubt in your
[1:10:35] mind, you ask what you want to.
[1:10:40] And if and see if it ain't laid in your
[1:10:41] lap,
[1:10:43] he says, "I'd be a false prophet if it
[1:10:45] don't happen."
[1:10:46] Amen.
[1:10:48] Ask for anything. You're poor. Your
[1:10:51] sister's crippled. Your father mother's
[1:10:53] old. Ask what you want.
[1:10:58] Whatever you ask for, Sister Hadtie. See
[1:11:00] now if it happens or not right now cuz
[1:11:03] he has just told me the same voice. Give
[1:11:07] her what she asked for.
[1:11:10] And she looked around and said, "What
[1:11:11] shall I ask for, brother Brandham?
[1:11:14] What?" Say what your desire is.
[1:11:17] Think of your greatest desire and say
[1:11:20] it.
[1:11:22] He said her boys were snickering in a
[1:11:24] corner
[1:11:25] and laughing. She said, "The greatest
[1:11:28] desire that I have
[1:11:31] is the salvation of my two boys
[1:11:35] and he says, I give them to you in the
[1:11:37] name of Jesus Christ."
[1:11:41] Hallelujah.
[1:11:44] Another place he said that she said
[1:11:46] that's nothing but the truth. She had
[1:11:47] said the right thing. Here's my Bible.
[1:11:50] As a servant of God, I say this. I can
[1:11:52] hardly hear it.
[1:11:54] Her mother was trying to say something,
[1:11:55] but I didn't get it. Just as she had
[1:11:57] said, she had said the right thing, the
[1:12:00] spirit of the Lord said to me, "Tell her
[1:12:02] to ask what she will, and you'll give it
[1:12:05] to her."
[1:12:08] He said that room everything everybody
[1:12:10] felt strange.
[1:12:12] I said sister
[1:12:15] thus sayaith the Lord speak anything
[1:12:18] that you desire. I don't care what it
[1:12:21] is. If you want to know that God's give
[1:12:24] this ministry and speak anything that
[1:12:26] you desire.
[1:12:28] Thus sayith the Lord. If you'll speak it
[1:12:31] I will speak it behind you
[1:12:33] and you'll have it right here.
[1:12:37] Amen.
[1:12:38] She said, "Brother Brandon, what shall I
[1:12:39] say?" He says, "It's up to you."
[1:12:41] As we tell her again, you got a crippled
[1:12:43] sister, aged father, you're poor. You
[1:12:45] could ask for money.
[1:12:48] She could ask for a million dollars. It
[1:12:50] been right there, right then.
[1:12:55] And she just said, "I want the salvation
[1:12:57] of my two boys." And I said, "You have
[1:12:59] it in the name of the Lord." And these
[1:13:02] two little modern teenage sticker fist
[1:13:04] boys, they had hated the very cause of
[1:13:07] Christ, grabbed one another and began to
[1:13:10] scream the blessings of God. The power
[1:13:13] of God struck that place. He said gramps
[1:13:16] fell into his plate. I don't know what
[1:13:18] happened for about 10 minutes.
[1:13:23] Maybe we need to get beside of oursel.
[1:13:27] We So we won't know what happens goes
[1:13:29] going on for the next 10 minutes.
[1:13:31] whatever we're going to say will happen.
[1:13:36] He says, "Friend, do you realize what
[1:13:38] that was?
[1:13:39] I have never in my life felt such an
[1:13:43] anointing."
[1:13:46] And he says, "The first time it ever
[1:13:48] performed on a human being, it bypassed
[1:13:51] aristocrats. It bypassed everything else
[1:13:54] and went to a poor little old
[1:13:56] widow woman living up on a hill cuz God
[1:14:00] knowed what she'd asked for.
[1:14:02] Amen.
[1:14:04] God bypass presidents, congressmen,
[1:14:08] leaders of the of the area
[1:14:10] to come to you.
[1:14:12] Amen.
[1:14:14] whatsoever
[1:14:16] ye ask for
[1:14:19] her two boys were was Gloria saved the
[1:14:22] very minute it was spoken.
[1:14:28] I like what people says them boys ain't
[1:14:30] living right. It don't matter.
[1:14:34] It don't matter cuz the word had done
[1:14:36] gone out.
[1:14:38] Amen.
[1:14:39] A word had been spoken.
[1:14:41] Anything she would ask for, it would
[1:14:43] have been given to her.
[1:14:46] Ask anything that you will and it shall
[1:14:49] be given unto you. Anything you desire.
[1:14:53] Don't you see the words of Jesus Christ
[1:14:56] being fulfilled?
[1:14:58] It's going to come to pass pretty soon.
[1:15:00] And I'm looking for it to happen in this
[1:15:01] meeting.
[1:15:05] I'm wanting it to happen now.
[1:15:09] How many wants it to happen now? Amen.
[1:15:13] That that anointing will strike this
[1:15:15] church of the living God. And she'll
[1:15:18] rise to her feet like a mighty marching
[1:15:20] army.
[1:15:24] The sick will be healed by the word. The
[1:15:26] blind will see. The deaf will hear. The
[1:15:29] dead will be raised up.
[1:15:31] And the power of God will shake the
[1:15:34] world with the church of the living God.
[1:15:40] God's going to shake this world with
[1:15:42] you.
[1:15:48] Now, you can see the saying about the
[1:15:49] apostles. They turn the world upside
[1:15:52] down.
[1:15:52] Amen.
[1:15:54] I'm ready to turn the world upside down.
[1:15:57] I'm ready to shake this world.
[1:16:01] We're in the process of it now. He says,
[1:16:04] "I believe it's soon coming to pass, and
[1:16:07] I believe it will be just exactly that
[1:16:10] way.
[1:16:13] I believe it's going to strike the
[1:16:14] church."
[1:16:16] There's your dynamics,
[1:16:18] striking the mechanics.
[1:16:21] I believe it's going to strike the
[1:16:22] church of God soon. It's going to start
[1:16:25] a revival that's going to shake the
[1:16:27] world. He says, "I believe it."
[1:16:29] So, this is the age that you're living
[1:16:30] in.
[1:16:31] Yeah. We're living in the age of the
[1:16:33] spoken word.
[1:16:36] Hallelujah.
[1:16:39] Let's stand.
[1:16:45] It all goes with your attitude.
[1:16:48] Brett said, "Look, musicians come the
[1:16:51] right mental attitude towards any divine
[1:16:55] promise of God will bring it to pass."
[1:16:58] Can you understand what I mean?
[1:17:02] The right mental attitude towards any
[1:17:04] divine promise of God will bring it to
[1:17:06] pass.
[1:17:08] If you'll take the right mental attitude
[1:17:10] towards every anything that God has
[1:17:13] promised,
[1:17:15] God's under obligation to see that you
[1:17:17] get it
[1:17:20] all because he promised it.
[1:17:24] Hallelujah.
[1:17:25] We're living in that age.
[1:17:29] We're in the age of the spoken word.
[1:17:34] Speak
[1:17:35] and it's going to come to pass.
[1:17:39] So, what's your need tonight?
[1:17:41] Amen.
[1:17:44] Every one of us has a need.
[1:17:48] Speak to the mountain.
[1:17:52] You might speak to a mountain. It's in
[1:17:54] front of you and you don't see nothing
[1:17:55] happening.
[1:17:57] But we know right on the other side a
[1:17:58] pebble started moving.
[1:18:02] You might realize tomorrow that
[1:18:04] mountain's gone.
[1:18:07] Speak to the mountain
[1:18:10] and cast into the sea.
[1:18:13] Whatever mountain stand in front of you,
[1:18:15] cast it into the sea.
[1:18:21] You need it. You need healing.
[1:18:25] We all do.

[1:23:41] to figure out what they want to do,
[1:23:42] Lord. Father, may you just go to her

[1:24:23] up our hands to you, Father, cuz you
[1:24:25] just said, "Ask anything in your name,
[1:24:28] and you're going to do it." Father,
[1:24:30] we're asking you to meet these needs
[1:24:31] right now, Father, in the name of Jesus
[1:24:34] Christ. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:24:38] Anybody got anything to say,
[1:24:40] testimonies?
[1:24:43] want to testify that um last Thursday at
[1:24:45] the men's prayer meeting
[1:24:48] I'd really just been suffering a lot
[1:24:50] with the shingles on my head and from
[1:24:53] that moment when those brothers prayed
[1:24:54] for me it's just like every day I was
[1:24:57] getting better and better and better
[1:24:58] from that I could tell the very next day
[1:25:01] that I was I was moving up and even the
[1:25:03] weekend um kind of you know had its
[1:25:07] effect but right away it began going up
[1:25:09] again and today this is the first day in
[1:25:12] probably three weeks I don't remember
[1:25:14] having one single spasm strike my head.
[1:25:17] I'm thinking
[1:25:19] [Applause]
[1:25:26] um uh as I've testified testified before
[1:25:29] um a while back I tore my knee up uh
[1:25:32] going through an attic access and a few
[1:25:33] months ago brother Matt prayed for me
[1:25:35] and it totally healed my knee um and
[1:25:38] then a couple days ago it started
[1:25:40] hurting again and I've been aching you
[1:25:42] know trying to hop along to my job and
[1:25:45] while I was just sitting there about 20
[1:25:47] minutes ago he said accept your healing.
[1:25:50] I said amen and I felt the Lord touch my
[1:25:52] knee and it's perfectly fine. So
[1:25:54] [Applause]
[1:26:02] um just we couldn't find the marriage
[1:26:04] license me and Esther and we got in the
[1:26:07] car. I'm like, "Well, let's go look in
[1:26:08] the shed cuz it's just full of wedding
[1:26:10] presents and the house has just been
[1:26:13] piles of stuff that needs to go to
[1:26:15] Wanda's and Andrea's and all over the
[1:26:17] place." And I'm like, "I have no idea
[1:26:18] where it is." And we got in the car and
[1:26:20] she I said, "Let's" or I she might have
[1:26:22] suggested, "Let's pray." And she prayed
[1:26:25] and then we got out on the road and I
[1:26:27] thought, "I know right where it is." And
[1:26:29] we went right into the it was in the
[1:26:30] gift bag from I had taken that special
[1:26:33] gift out cuz I was worried about it and
[1:26:35] people kept I'm like that goes to
[1:26:37] Micah's house. We're shoving stuff in
[1:26:39] that gift bag and so it just in my head
[1:26:42] like that and it was right there. So
[1:26:44] thank God for that. Amen.
[1:26:47] [Applause]
[1:26:52] Can I give one for sister Debbie? So
[1:26:55] week Sunday before last, um she had had
[1:26:58] a real problem in the upper part of her
[1:27:01] right leg so bad that at night it was
[1:27:04] waking her up. Every time she would move
[1:27:06] it just be excruciating and wake her up
[1:27:08] all through the night. And uh she came
[1:27:11] in, we came to the service and after the
[1:27:13] service I was sitting in my back office
[1:27:15] and I I heard some ladies come in the
[1:27:19] door and they were talking and I heard
[1:27:21] somebody start talking loud. It sound
[1:27:23] like somebody was praying and I thought,
[1:27:24] goodness, that sound like brother Joe.
[1:27:26] And sure enough, brother Joe had walked
[1:27:28] in the door and sister Debbie was
[1:27:30] standing there talking to another sister
[1:27:32] and she had a grimace look on her face
[1:27:33] and brother Joe just stopped, you know,
[1:27:35] as a minister would. Sister, are you all
[1:27:37] right? And she began to tell him, he
[1:27:39] just said, "Well, let's pray right now."
[1:27:40] He prayed for her and by the time she
[1:27:43] got home, it was just gone the next day
[1:27:46] completely. Not another trace of it. So,
[1:27:48] we're just thanking the Lord.
[1:28:00] So, uh, Friday,
[1:28:04] my wife and I have been talking about
[1:28:05] upgrading our Expedition because it's
[1:28:08] old and has like 265,000 miles on it.
[1:28:12] And so, I um
[1:28:16] talked to the Lord and I said, "If if
[1:28:17] you want me to get a new expedition,
[1:28:18] you're going to have to sell this one
[1:28:19] today." Okay. So, I took a couple
[1:28:20] pictures of it, posted on Facebook, and
[1:28:23] two hours it was gone. I'm still waiting
[1:28:25] on the new one. So, that's going to be a
[1:28:27] miracle in itself because I don't have a
[1:28:29] whole lot of money to buy another one,
[1:28:30] but the Lord's uh Lord's working
[1:28:32] something out. I don't know what it is
[1:28:34] yet. So, we're just waiting on the other
[1:28:36] half now.
[1:28:39] [Applause]
[1:28:44] So, a couple guys I've already kind of
[1:28:46] told this to, but um talking about kind
[1:28:50] of the third pole
[1:28:52] working in action, you know, speaking
[1:28:54] things into existence, and I know talked
[1:28:56] really Jason about it. Um,
[1:29:00] a few weeks ago, I guess a month ago or
[1:29:02] something, I
[1:29:05] ripped up the transmission in my truck
[1:29:06] and it was sent it off, went and got
[1:29:09] rebuilt and everything. But when I got
[1:29:10] it back, there's some places that you
[1:29:13] have to thread some very specific bolts
[1:29:17] into that are very fragile and you that
[1:29:20] you need them to drive at all. So when I
[1:29:24] got the transmission back, the threads
[1:29:26] on the inside of the transmission were
[1:29:28] totally totally stripped. So it was just
[1:29:31] smooth. You couldn't thread anything in
[1:29:33] there. It's impossible to use it. So I
[1:29:36] was kind of laying under the truck a
[1:29:39] little bit, just torn up. And Gideon was
[1:29:42] inside the house. I was in the garage,
[1:29:43] but Gideon's in there and I'm all alone.
[1:29:46] And I said, "Lord, I just
[1:29:49] I can't do this. I have nowhere else to
[1:29:52] do. I can't redo my threads. I can't fix
[1:29:55] them few different ways. You know, I
[1:29:58] there's no other way to do it. So, I
[1:30:00] need you to rebuild my threads. So, it's
[1:30:05] silly to some people, but to me it was
[1:30:07] just awesome that
[1:30:12] I was laying under there and I said it
[1:30:13] and it wasn't like a big rushing feeling
[1:30:17] like, oh, it did it. But
[1:30:20] I get out and it's like it's not based
[1:30:22] off of uh it's not based off feeling,
[1:30:24] it's based off your faith. So I held the
[1:30:27] faith on it and walked inside and told
[1:30:30] Gideon kind of what I was feeling and
[1:30:33] just was really bummed out. But standing
[1:30:36] at the sink, he was Gideon was to my
[1:30:39] back and I turned around to him and I
[1:30:40] said, "Hey, God just rebuilt my threads
[1:30:44] just now." And I didn't touch those
[1:30:46] bolts. They weren't tight, nothing. I
[1:30:49] haven't touched them since and they work
[1:30:51] 100%.
[1:30:53] So, it was the transmission lines. So,
[1:30:56] without those being threaded in,
[1:30:59] it wouldn't work whatsoever. So, they're
[1:31:03] totally rebuilt. And that bolt is tight.
[1:31:06] So, and it's Yeah, it's pushing 100 and
[1:31:09] something PSI through a tiny little
[1:31:11] line. So, it's really tight. So,
[1:31:15] praise the Lord.
[1:31:23] This is this is for my wife. Um because
[1:31:28] I know that this church we pray about
[1:31:30] things getting lost all the time. Okay.
[1:31:33] Um for Christmas, I got my wife a pair
[1:31:36] of earpods that have built-in tile so we
[1:31:40] can track them. Okay. So,
[1:31:44] we didn't know when we activated them
[1:31:46] that you have to activate each one
[1:31:48] individually.
[1:31:51] So, we were getting ready for the
[1:31:53] wedding and my wife was out blowing
[1:31:56] leaves and she texts me. She goes,
[1:31:59] "Michael, I've lost one of my earpods."
[1:32:02] I'm like, "Well, it's got tile. Just
[1:32:04] search for it. It'll take you right
[1:32:06] there to it." She says, "Michael,
[1:32:09] it's the right one.
[1:32:11] It says the right one's not activated.
[1:32:16] And she says, "I've been out here for an
[1:32:17] hour blowing leaves. I have no idea
[1:32:19] where this is at." So, I'm like, "I'll
[1:32:21] be right out." So, I go out and we're
[1:32:23] looking around the yard and I, you know,
[1:32:25] my yard is okay in size and and all, but
[1:32:31] to try to find a little quartersiz
[1:32:34] object in my front yard, it would be a
[1:32:36] little difficult.
[1:32:38] So I um I'm like
[1:32:44] this church prays about missing things
[1:32:46] all the time. So let's just pray about
[1:32:49] it. And my wife and I stopped right
[1:32:52] there in the driveway and I said, this
[1:32:54] is one of two prayers that the Lord
[1:32:55] answered for me for this wedding. One of
[1:32:58] three, actually. Um and I said, Lord, I
[1:33:01] said, we can look all day, but that's
[1:33:04] just us. We have no idea where we're
[1:33:07] looking or what to look for.
[1:33:09] So, what I need, Lord, is you would come
[1:33:12] down and allow your angel to just point
[1:33:15] us to where we need to go and do it in
[1:33:19] less than 30 minutes.
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:23] And and just a simple prayer like that,
[1:33:26] we said, "Amen." I went inside. 18
[1:33:30] minutes later, my wife sends me a
[1:33:31] picture of her ear pod.
[1:33:36] Right. 30 minutes is all I asked for and
[1:33:39] he did it in 18.
[1:33:40] So he answers prayer.
[1:33:49] So I'm going to do a trifecta tonight.
[1:33:50] So
[1:33:52] I had um
[1:33:55] lost the garage door opener, the the
[1:33:57] little device you hold, and I was
[1:33:59] needing to program um my new truck, and
[1:34:01] I couldn't find it anywhere. and is like
[1:34:03] having a nervous breakdown because I
[1:34:05] don't lose things. It's like how is this
[1:34:07] impossible? And and and I had looked in
[1:34:11] this big box of stuff where I thought
[1:34:13] autopilot would put it and and I
[1:34:16] thought, "Okay, it's got to be right
[1:34:18] there." And I looked and I looked and it
[1:34:20] wasn't there. And I couldn't see it. I
[1:34:21] couldn't find it all. Of course, that
[1:34:22] doesn't mean a lot when I look for it.
[1:34:24] So, I got Sister Debbie to come out and
[1:34:26] look for it. And she looked and when she
[1:34:29] looks, if it ain't there, it's the
[1:34:30] gospel. It's not there.
[1:34:32] And it's and it was not there. And um
[1:34:36] and I think maybe she did you look once
[1:34:38] or twice and twice and then I looked
[1:34:40] like three times. And so it was just
[1:34:43] nowhere. And I was discouraged and I
[1:34:45] thought I'm going to have to figure out
[1:34:46] I'm have to get a number off the
[1:34:48] machine, order it. How am I going to
[1:34:49] this? Oh my goodness. And so I just
[1:34:52] thought to myself, I walked over to the
[1:34:54] blocks one more time and it's not there.
[1:34:56] I'm looking right there and I'm just
[1:34:58] leaping through. There's nothing. It's
[1:34:59] just not here. This is the fifth or
[1:35:00] sixth time. And I just said, "Lord, I
[1:35:02] just need it to be here." And I looked
[1:35:04] and there it was.
[1:35:06] Just as soon as I said that, within
[1:35:08] about one and a half seconds, I said,
[1:35:10] "Lord, I just needed to be here." And
[1:35:12] there it was. And I I don't even know
[1:35:14] what else to say. It was just right
[1:35:15] there. It was. So, praise the Lord.
[1:35:23] Anybody else?
[1:35:28] since it seems to be the night for lost
[1:35:30] items. I'm giving this for Jessica and
[1:35:33] by God's grace, she'll be here soon to
[1:35:35] give her own testimonies. But she has um
[1:35:38] she lost her car key. She has only one
[1:35:40] car key that'll crank her car. And
[1:35:42] actually, that's not true. She has two,
[1:35:44] but she lost the main one that's
[1:35:45] programmed and stuff. And she got it
[1:35:48] back. Well, then she lost um
[1:35:52] another thing. And right now, I can't
[1:35:54] even think of what it was. Oh, it was
[1:35:55] her wallet. and uh she needed her
[1:35:57] wallet, you know, obviously she you need
[1:35:59] your wallet, but she needed it
[1:36:00] specifically right away. And um she
[1:36:03] called me and she's like, "Mom, will you
[1:36:04] pray?" And I reminded her of all the
[1:36:06] things that she prayed about that God
[1:36:08] has been so good to give her back. And
[1:36:10] she's like, "I know, but" and she kind
[1:36:13] of knew where she lost it. She, you
[1:36:15] know, remembered where she had it last
[1:36:17] and she remembered putting it on the top
[1:36:19] of the car. Um, and so, you know,
[1:36:22] usually it's pretty unreoverable.
[1:36:26] And, um, so we were praying about it and
[1:36:29] and a few days later, someone knocked on
[1:36:31] the door and gave her her wallet back.
[1:36:34] So, she got it back.
[1:36:37] [Applause]
[1:36:45] I was just wanting to talk uh uh kind of
[1:36:50] solidify the testimony that brother
[1:36:52] Micah gave. Um in case anybody doesn't
[1:36:55] believe that God can do mechanic work.
[1:36:58] Um you should listen to the testimony
[1:37:00] brother Gerald Cleveland. He told he
[1:37:03] told me personally that in 1963 or 64 he
[1:37:06] had a busted wheel cylinder and the the
[1:37:09] brake fluid was just pouring out
[1:37:10] everywhere and he had to drive across
[1:37:12] the mountains back down all the way to
[1:37:14] South Carolina from Indiana. Brother Bam
[1:37:16] just said a simple prayer and I saw he
[1:37:19] still had the brake fluid that he bought
[1:37:21] to try to get him home in around 2002.
[1:37:25] That was from 63 to 2002. He still had
[1:37:27] it. He never had to put any in his car.
[1:37:30] So Amen.
[1:37:32] [Applause]
[1:37:38] Been enough testimonies here tonight to
[1:37:40] give us all faith.
[1:37:43] No matter what it is you have need of,
[1:37:46] we should leave this place victorious.
[1:37:52] Anybody else?
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:09] Is that it?
[1:38:11] Let's all bow our heads for a word of
[1:38:13] prayer.
[1:38:20] She had to get her bladder removed.
[1:38:22] Bladder cancer. So they removed her
[1:38:24] bladder.
[1:38:26] They got put a bag in her train. But
[1:38:31] she's having complications. She's not
[1:38:33] coming out well. She's been two weeks
[1:38:35] now.
[1:38:37] Supposed to operation and she's still in
[1:38:41] there. Suffer pretty good.
[1:38:46] Pray for that request along with sister
[1:38:47] Kathy.
[1:38:51] Father, you heard the request for our
[1:38:52] brother, Lord, this this lady, Lord,
[1:38:56] needing you.
[1:38:58] But God, we just pray, Father, may your
[1:39:00] healing just go to her, Lord. Lord,
[1:39:03] you're you're the creator of this thing,
[1:39:05] Lord, and you can fix it and make it
[1:39:06] like new again. Lord, may you just go to
[1:39:09] her and touch her. Sister Kathy, Lord,
[1:39:10] still need a touch from you, Lord. I
[1:39:13] just pray, God, that you would just move
[1:39:14] for her, Lord. And may we just be like
[1:39:17] brother Michael said, "May we'll just
[1:39:18] see her here Sunday, Father. She's
[1:39:20] getting so well, Lord. Father, we place
[1:39:23] this service into your hands,
[1:39:26] Lord. This thing will go down in the
[1:39:27] history books, Lord. And Father, we be
[1:39:30] held responsible for what we heard,
[1:39:32] Lord. May you move for each person. May
[1:39:34] you keep them safe as they travel. Bring
[1:39:37] us back here Sunday morning, Lord,
[1:39:38] expecting to hear great things from you.
[1:39:41] Father, we thank you and love you in
[1:39:43] Jesus name." Amen.
[1:39:45] Amen.
[1:39:46] said, "Don't forget the men's prayer
[1:39:48] meeting tomorrow night at 6:30." That's
