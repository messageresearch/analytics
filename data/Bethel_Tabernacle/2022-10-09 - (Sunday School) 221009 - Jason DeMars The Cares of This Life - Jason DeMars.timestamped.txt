[2:20] father we come before you now Lord and
[2:22] we ask that your Holy Spirit would just
[2:24] guide and lead us Lord through the day
[2:27] Lord through the topic this morning
[2:29] through the the worship Lord and through
[2:31] the preaching of the word may you be
[2:33] glorified and lifted up in all things
[2:34] Lord help
[2:36] help us to get our human side out of the
[2:39] way to Lord let your divine presence
[2:41] flow through
[2:42] to the hearts of the people Lord
[2:45] anoint your word make it alive we ask in
[2:47] Jesus name amen I'm gonna
[2:51] start speaking on the cares of this life
[2:55] and uh
[2:57] looking at it in the in in the realm of
[2:59] distraction or stewardship
[3:02] or both I guess you could say so
[3:05] you've probably all read that scripture
[3:07] but we'll read it together
[3:09] and take heed to yourselves lest at any
[3:11] time your hearts be overcharged with
[3:14] surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of
[3:16] this life
[3:17] and so that day come upon you unawares
[3:20] amen you can be seated
[3:25] so how many know the definition of the
[3:28] word surfing
[3:30] well I do now but when I read it
[3:34] when I read this I definitely was like
[3:37] like what is
[3:39] surfing
[3:41] it's not surfing
[3:44] so don't worry brother Travis if you're
[3:46] listening in
[3:48] it's it's something completely different
[3:50] it speaks with it speaks of
[3:52] carousing
[3:53] it would be one of the words that we
[3:55] have it's means to have a noisy
[3:58] loud time while drinking alcohol so
[4:01] basically it means going to a British
[4:03] pub
[4:04] is pretty much what
[4:06] what that is right there
[4:09] and so uh
[4:11] the word overcharged
[4:14] means to be burdened or weighed down or
[4:18] if it even can speak of being dulled
[4:22] so Jesus is warning them
[4:24] you know if we look at the larger
[4:26] context of this he's
[4:27] speaking about the coming of the Messiah
[4:30] the end times
[4:32] and he's saying you know it's really a
[4:34] warning for believers of every age
[4:36] because no matter what age you're living
[4:38] in whether it was a first second third
[4:40] fourth fifth sixth you're supposed to be
[4:42] living in in a way that he could come at
[4:45] any moment
[4:46] and under expectation that he's going to
[4:48] come at any moment that the Rapture is
[4:50] going to take place and so but it really
[4:53] uh even further and more deeply applies
[4:56] to the seventh
[4:58] Church age and even more even more so
[5:02] the end of that seventh Church age
[5:06] we these are the things Jesus is
[5:09] speaking of that can prevent us from
[5:12] living our lives with anticipation and
[5:15] expectation for the Lord to appear
[5:18] in the rapture
[5:21] and so he's saying don't let your hearts
[5:24] be dulled
[5:27] burdened way down with what we're
[5:31] supposed to carry a burden in our heart
[5:33] the burden of the word of the Lord
[5:35] burden for God's people a burden for
[5:38] prayer but not a burden because we've
[5:42] been going to to the bar and drinking
[5:45] and partying hard
[5:47] that's not the kind of burdens that
[5:49] we're supposed to carry those types of
[5:51] burdens
[5:52] honestly it's a very ostentatious
[5:55] obvious
[5:58] and for most Christians a very much
[6:00] avoidable
[6:02] burden that
[6:04] is not likely to weigh down the heart
[6:07] of a
[6:09] a believer of the message now it could
[6:13] but when we're talking about sins that
[6:16] trouble us as message Believers
[6:17] followers of the word of this day
[6:20] it's that doesn't make the top of the
[6:23] list drunkenness and partying
[6:27] for many of us there's no appeal there's
[6:30] no desire there but then Jesus goes to
[6:33] something else that can easily impact
[6:36] all of us and he says the cares of this
[6:38] life
[6:39] and I think in this in this time that
[6:43] we're living in this is the biggest
[6:45] thing that can weigh us down
[6:49] again overcharged burdened weighed down
[6:54] dulled dold is probably my favorite way
[6:57] to define that because that's just what
[7:00] this a the laodicea and age does to us
[7:03] it dulls us that's Satan's purpose he
[7:07] knows he's not going to deceive the
[7:09] elect though he tries but he's certainly
[7:12] going to do everything he can to bring
[7:14] us to that lukewarm dull condition
[7:20] and so don't be overcharged
[7:23] with burdens and cares of this life
[7:27] so what does that mean what are the
[7:29] cares of this life
[7:32] so are you not supposed to care at all
[7:34] no it's not in that sense this word care
[7:37] is speaking of anxiety or worry
[7:42] so anxiety or worry over the things of
[7:46] this life
[7:47] can lead us to a place where our hearts
[7:50] are dull
[7:53] so what are what is the cares what are
[7:55] the worries of this life
[7:59] let's let's think about that for a
[8:01] minute Matthew chapter 6 verse 25.
[8:08] therefore I say unto you
[8:12] take no thought for your life
[8:14] what you shall eat or what you shall
[8:17] drink nor yet for your body what you
[8:20] shall put on
[8:21] is not the life more than Raymond and
[8:23] the body more than meat
[8:26] behold the fowls of the year for they
[8:28] sow not neither do they reap nor gather
[8:31] into barns yet your heavenly father
[8:32] feeds them are you not much better than
[8:35] they
[8:36] which of You by taking thought can add
[8:39] one qubit onto a stature and why take
[8:42] you thought for raiment consider the
[8:45] lilies of the field how they grow they
[8:46] toil not neither do they spin and yet I
[8:49] say unto you that even Solomon in all
[8:52] his glory was not arrayed like one of
[8:54] these
[8:54] wherefore if God so clothed the grass of
[8:57] the field which today is and tomorrow is
[8:59] cast into the oven shall he not much
[9:01] more clothe you o you of little faith
[9:04] therefore take no thought saying what
[9:06] shall we eat or what shall we drink or
[9:08] wherewithal shall we be clothed for
[9:10] after all these things do the Gentiles
[9:13] seek for your heavenly father knows you
[9:15] have
[9:16] need of them
[9:19] so this is speaking of the cares of this
[9:22] life
[9:24] brother Branham says in the trumpet
[9:26] gives an uncertain sound Grant Lord that
[9:28] those who have never come will find that
[9:30] precious freedom of being free turned
[9:33] out of the cage no more Bound by the
[9:35] things of the world and the cares of
[9:38] this life but has been made free in
[9:40] Christ granted father we can become
[9:42] captives in bondage
[9:46] to the things of the world yes we get
[9:48] that but also we can become captives and
[9:51] in bondage to the cares of this life
[9:56] and we need to get C free from that
[9:59] the cares it's again it speaks of
[10:01] anxieties and worries when Jesus says
[10:04] take no thought what do you think he's
[10:06] telling you don't even think about it
[10:09] no it's again this is an Old English
[10:12] word when they when they said
[10:15] I'm taking thought about this they meant
[10:18] I'm worried about it that was their
[10:21] expression that was their statement
[10:23] don't uh don't worry don't have an
[10:27] anxious thought about it
[10:30] trust trust the Lord trust he'll take
[10:33] care of you
[10:36] at the same time
[10:38] we can become captives
[10:41] to those things
[10:43] of this life
[10:45] how do we become captives when we put
[10:47] our Focus
[10:49] completely on them when we seek those
[10:52] things first and and when we let that
[10:56] turn into anxiety and fear
[10:59] the devil Works through anxiety and fear
[11:02] God works through faith
[11:05] so again this these this series of
[11:08] verses
[11:10] misinterpreted creates monasteries
[11:13] and creates super spiritual people that
[11:17] are in such a condition where they don't
[11:18] even think about food and they're just
[11:20] they're mooching off everybody else and
[11:23] you you see what I'm saying is you you
[11:25] can take those things and say take no
[11:27] thought for that
[11:28] and the next thing you know you don't
[11:31] work you've refused to work
[11:33] you're just you're just in prayer all
[11:35] the time
[11:36] um
[11:37] you're just so spiritual
[11:39] and the reality is you're not being
[11:41] spiritual at all because you're not
[11:42] doing the will of God
[11:49] so Jesus speaks of food
[11:52] he speaks of clothes and he speaks of
[11:55] water these are basic necessities of
[11:59] life he doesn't
[12:00] add a roof over our heads but I'll just
[12:02] go ahead and say for a hard day and age
[12:05] that's one of the things that we seek
[12:07] after we need these things these are not
[12:10] light things they're not unimportant you
[12:13] can't survive
[12:15] without these things
[12:18] um you know some people can survive
[12:19] better than others without a roof over
[12:21] their heads but
[12:23] if you're like me you need a roof over
[12:24] your head
[12:27] and so
[12:31] the Bible actually commands us to think
[12:34] about
[12:36] and plan for food
[12:39] clothes shelter water and work
[12:46] you realize it's not telling you don't
[12:48] think about it
[12:49] oh I'm thinking about my job stop that
[12:52] I was thinking about what I'm gonna
[12:54] where I'm gonna get my water don't think
[12:57] that's not what it's telling us don't
[12:58] worry
[13:00] don't be in fear over it
[13:03] that's what's forbidden is anxiety we're
[13:05] commanded to trust God
[13:07] for his provision
[13:08] and then take the steps that He commands
[13:11] us to take to be sure that they're taken
[13:13] care of
[13:15] Proverbs 6 verse 1.
[13:19] and
[13:20] if you can pull up the
[13:22] um
[13:23] NLT on that version there Josh be great
[13:29] my child
[13:31] if you have put up security for a
[13:33] friend's debt or agreed to guarantee the
[13:35] debt of a stranger
[13:37] if you've trapped Yourself by your
[13:39] Arrangement agreement and are caught by
[13:41] what you said follow my advice and save
[13:43] yourself for you have placed yourself at
[13:45] your friend's Mercy
[13:47] now swallow your pride go and beg to
[13:50] have your name erased don't put it off
[13:52] do it now don't rest until you do it
[13:55] save yourself like a gazelle escaping
[13:58] from a hunter like a bird fleeing from a
[14:00] net
[14:01] take a lesson from the ants you lazy
[14:03] bones
[14:05] in the KJV it says you sluggered
[14:08] learn from their ways and become wise
[14:11] though they have no Prince or Governor
[14:13] or ruler to make them work they labor
[14:16] hard all summer
[14:17] Gathering food for the winter but you
[14:20] lazy bones how long will you sleep when
[14:23] will you wake up a little extra sleep a
[14:25] little more Slumber a little folding of
[14:27] the hands to rest then poverty will
[14:30] pounce on you like a bandit scarcely
[14:32] scarcity will attack you like an armed
[14:35] robber
[14:38] so it's clear this the this is speaking
[14:40] of
[14:41] hard work
[14:43] careful forethought planning preparation
[14:47] saving looking towards the future
[14:50] understanding when you in those days
[14:53] when winter came for them for them in in
[14:57] the lands of the Bible it was rainy
[14:59] season
[15:00] so
[15:02] that wasn't a time for Harvest and for
[15:04] for growing crops very well so they were
[15:07] to work hard during that dry season the
[15:10] summer so that when it came to that time
[15:13] they had food in store yeah
[15:16] and and they were supposed to give
[15:18] they're supposed to give their first
[15:19] fruits they were supposed to tithe these
[15:22] were things that God expected of them he
[15:24] didn't say just sit and wait for things
[15:27] to work out
[15:28] he told them to work make preparation
[15:30] and put things in store
[15:33] and he can think the Bible condemns
[15:36] laziness and it commends hard-working
[15:39] forethought and saving
[15:43] Proverbs 21 verse 5.
[15:47] good planning and hard work lead to
[15:50] prosperity
[15:52] but Hasty short shortcuts lead to
[15:56] poverty
[15:57] the the desire to get rich quick
[16:01] is condemned by the Bible
[16:05] what what is encouraged
[16:08] plan plan ahead
[16:11] and hard work
[16:13] that's what's encouraged by the Bible
[16:15] Proverbs 24 27.
[16:18] do your planning and prepare your Fields
[16:21] before building your house
[16:24] in other words get your job figured out
[16:26] get a job
[16:28] work hard
[16:29] get everything right make things ready
[16:31] then buy a house
[16:34] don't worry about well I got to get a
[16:37] house I got to get this taken care of
[16:38] and then I'll find a job that's not
[16:41] scriptural plan prepare buy a house
[16:45] no
[16:46] or rent a house whatever you whatever
[16:48] you need to do
[16:49] the point being is the Bible is teaching
[16:51] us to take thought
[16:54] not to worry
[16:56] to plan
[16:57] proverbs 10 verse 4.
[17:02] lazy people are soon poor
[17:05] hard workers get rich
[17:10] a wise youth harvests in the summer but
[17:13] one who sleeps during Harvest is a
[17:15] disgrace
[17:20] again you could see what the Bible is
[17:21] encouraging and speaking of
[17:23] Proverbs 13 11.
[17:27] and I'm going to read it from the ESV
[17:29] wealth gained hastily will dwindle but
[17:31] whoever gathers little by little will
[17:35] increase it
[17:37] little by little
[17:39] save up every month
[17:42] save for emergencies save for the future
[17:45] be careful be wise
[17:49] Proverbs 21 18.
[17:55] if you want to switch back to the
[17:57] uh KJV there
[18:06] I said 21 18 28 18.
[18:12] whoever walks in Integrity will be
[18:14] delivered but he who is crooked in his
[18:16] ways will suddenly fall
[18:19] whoever works his land will have plenty
[18:22] of bread but heals follows worthless
[18:24] Pursuits will have plenty of poverty
[18:28] a faithful man will abound with
[18:30] blessings
[18:31] but whoever hastens to be rich will not
[18:33] go unpunished you see again
[18:37] it's it's hard work it's planning it's
[18:40] forethought it's Integrity honesty
[18:43] truthfulness these are the things that
[18:46] will put give you success in your life
[18:50] now Proverbs 21 verse 20.
[18:55] there is treasure to be desired and oil
[18:58] in the dwelling of the wise
[19:01] but a foolish man spends it up
[19:06] there again
[19:08] there's treasure there's save another
[19:10] way we could say there's a savings
[19:12] there's storage of oil
[19:16] in the dwelling of the wise why because
[19:18] he's carefully planned and thought ahead
[19:21] and put things aside for the future but
[19:25] a foolish man he just spends everything
[19:26] that he has it's essentially what that's
[19:28] saying
[19:30] so the Bible is telling us it's not wise
[19:33] to live paycheck to paycheck
[19:35] some of us have to some of us do
[19:38] we do our best but we'll do our best to
[19:40] work towards the place where okay we can
[19:44] save a little bit every month we can put
[19:45] put aside for emergencies
[19:49] the Bible is giving us very practical
[19:53] and wise steps to take
[19:56] it's not giving us super spiritual just
[19:59] pray and wait in your room until gold a
[20:03] bag of gold hits you in the head
[20:06] that's not what God that's not how it
[20:08] works that's not what God wants he wants
[20:10] diligence
[20:11] whether you're a preacher
[20:13] or a laborer or a business owner a
[20:17] farmer
[20:18] an I.T person a manager whatever work
[20:21] you do it's telling you to work hard
[20:25] you should be the best worker you should
[20:26] be the most favored person oh you should
[20:29] all be Joseph at your job you might not
[20:31] be the the CEO
[20:34] you might be on the you might be on the
[20:36] lowest level
[20:38] but your boss should look and say this
[20:40] person I can trust them they have
[20:42] integrity they're honest they work hard
[20:46] and God will God can bless that but if
[20:48] you're lazy and just go there and just
[20:50] expect everyone to take care of you how
[20:52] can God bless that he can't he never
[20:54] will
[20:55] so when we're talking about take no
[20:57] thought it's not a super spiritual
[20:59] statement
[21:00] it's literally telling don't worry about
[21:03] it but I what if I have this I don't
[21:05] know if I can do this do the things that
[21:07] God told you to do
[21:09] and let him take care of the rest
[21:12] if you don't have a job
[21:14] that your full-time job is to look for a
[21:17] job it's these these simple simple
[21:20] things they're not it's not complicated
[21:22] it's not complex
[21:24] understand that there's other situations
[21:26] and circumstances there's sicknesses
[21:28] there's all these different things that
[21:29] happen in people's lives nevertheless
[21:32] the principle stands whatever position
[21:34] or place you find you're in yourself in
[21:36] you work hard you do your best to
[21:39] prepare for the future as best you can
[21:41] but you don't you don't go in that
[21:45] preparation for the future you don't
[21:47] store up Barns and say like the man say
[21:49] oh Soul take your rest see that's
[21:52] getting that's out of balance there's a
[21:54] balance in this
[21:56] you can come to this place where you
[21:58] think so much about it what's the next
[22:00] step
[22:02] and that's that's your God
[22:04] you cannot serve God and money
[22:10] so the Bible is very clear we're to work
[22:12] hard be diligent we're to avoid laziness
[22:15] we're to get a job and make a plan
[22:17] before buying a home or renting a home
[22:19] or plan where to plan ahead for expenses
[22:22] we're to save for the future we're to
[22:23] save for emergencies we're to save
[22:25] little by little every month and we're
[22:28] to avoid trying to get rich quickly
[22:32] the wise do these things
[22:35] that's what the that's what the Bible
[22:37] shows us the foolish don't do these
[22:40] things
[22:44] second Thessalonians chapter 3.
[22:50] for even when we were with you this we
[22:53] commanded you
[22:54] that if any would not work neither
[22:57] should he eat
[22:59] for we hear that there are some which
[23:01] walk among you disorderly working not at
[23:05] all but our busy bodies
[23:07] now them that are such we command and
[23:10] exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that
[23:12] with quietness
[23:14] they work and eat their own bread
[23:18] in other words keep your mouth shut
[23:22] do your job
[23:24] and make provision for yourself and for
[23:26] your family
[23:30] if you another scripture says if you
[23:33] don't provide for your own you're worse
[23:35] than an infidel
[23:39] let's go to Matthew chapter 6 again
[23:42] verse 33 and 34.
[23:47] let's go let's go now to the back how do
[23:50] we balance this out we have
[23:52] responsibilities we have stewardship we
[23:55] have things we have to do in this life
[23:57] but they're not supposed to become our
[23:59] God
[24:00] they're not supposed to be our primary
[24:01] focus
[24:03] right we're not we're not supposed to
[24:06] seek those things first what are we
[24:07] supposed to seek first the kingdom of
[24:09] God and his righteousness and all these
[24:13] things shall be added unto you all these
[24:15] things are what what did he say food
[24:17] water raiment
[24:21] and I'll just add as a result of that
[24:23] you'll also have a place to live
[24:28] see ye first the kingdom of God and his
[24:30] righteousness and all these things will
[24:31] be added unto you so that's that should
[24:33] be our first
[24:34] approach our first Vision our first
[24:37] priority
[24:39] verse 34.
[24:41] take therefore no
[24:43] anxious thought
[24:46] for the morrow
[24:47] for the morrow shall take thought for
[24:49] the things of itself sufficient unto the
[24:52] day is the evil thereof many times I
[24:55] looked at this verse and I approached it
[24:57] in the sense of just don't even think
[24:59] about tomorrow just think about today
[25:02] well how do you do that when the Bible's
[25:04] telling you to save put aside for when
[25:07] winter comes you know it's take no
[25:10] anxious thought for tomorrow
[25:12] you're borrowing trouble you're worth
[25:14] what what is worrying it's Faith
[25:17] misapplied your it's imagination
[25:20] misapplied you're imagining
[25:23] negative things could happen
[25:25] well did God provide for today
[25:28] then you can trust the provide for
[25:30] tomorrow
[25:31] but that doesn't erase the rest of the
[25:34] Commandments of the Bible
[25:37] don't get so spiritual that you erase
[25:39] important commands of obedience to the
[25:42] word
[25:45] if you trust God and obey God
[25:48] then you'll seek his will in every
[25:51] decision that you make
[25:52] you'll work hard
[25:54] you'll give to others you'll plan ahead
[25:56] you'll save for the future you'll take
[25:58] care of your family
[26:00] those things are actually being obedient
[26:02] to God
[26:05] when you don't work hard when you don't
[26:07] save for the future when you don't plan
[26:09] ahead
[26:11] um when you don't give
[26:13] that's you're being disobedient
[26:15] it's very it's very plain through
[26:18] scripture
[26:20] however again you can easily get out of
[26:23] balance and say well I'm just being
[26:25] obedient to God
[26:26] putting my whole focus on work and all
[26:29] this stuff no that's not scriptural
[26:31] that's not balance
[26:33] you put God first in everything
[26:36] the job that you do the work that you do
[26:38] you don't put that before God you put
[26:41] God first so in other words if it comes
[26:44] between your work
[26:46] and worshiping God on Sunday
[26:50] you say I choose worshiping the Lord in
[26:53] church on Sunday
[26:54] amen right
[26:56] you know you don't it's one cop I
[27:00] promise you one compromise
[27:02] in that will lead to many many more
[27:05] compromises in that until you have no
[27:08] boundaries and no balance in your life
[27:12] start out right in your job
[27:15] there's no I remember one time I I
[27:17] started the job had a boss said you
[27:20] don't have to work Sunday
[27:21] then we got a new manager and said
[27:23] everyone has to work uh every day of the
[27:25] week
[27:26] and we're open on Sunday so you have to
[27:28] work I said no I I don't
[27:31] she said absolutely you do everyone else
[27:33] does I'm a Christian I don't work on
[27:35] Sundays we're all Christians I said okay
[27:40] that's fine but you understand
[27:42] it's not that I don't want to work on
[27:44] Sunday
[27:45] I don't work on Sunday so if you put me
[27:49] on the schedule for Sunday and I don't
[27:51] show up and you fire me you'll be firing
[27:54] me because I'm a Christian
[27:55] and he she backpedaled and immediately
[27:58] said I'm sorry I'm not trying to
[27:59] persecute you you don't have to work on
[28:02] Sunday it's fine
[28:06] but if I would have said oh
[28:08] man she's putting oh man no no pressure
[28:11] from a human being overrides the
[28:14] pressure that God is putting on me it
[28:16] never should
[28:19] if you put God first he'll take care of
[28:21] you even if you were to get fired from
[28:23] that job the Lord will give you
[28:25] something equal or better
[28:30] laughs
[28:32] Mark 4 verse 18.
[28:36] and 19.
[28:38] and these are they which are sown among
[28:40] Thorns such as hear the word
[28:42] and the cares of this world and the
[28:45] deceitfulness of riches and the lust of
[28:47] other things entering in choke the word
[28:50] and it becomes unfruitful
[28:53] so there we are you have you have a
[28:55] choice
[28:56] you can seek first the kingdom of God in
[28:58] his righteousness and then God will take
[29:00] care of your needs or you can take it
[29:02] into your own hands and say you know
[29:05] what I'm not going to seek the kingdom
[29:06] of God first I'm going to take into them
[29:08] in my own hands but what are you doing
[29:10] you're choking the word
[29:13] when the management of our Affairs the
[29:16] property finances Etc comes to the state
[29:18] that we can no longer be good stewards
[29:21] of them and and also be seeking the
[29:24] kingdom of God first it's time to start
[29:27] selling property it's time to start
[29:28] giving away finances it's start it's
[29:31] time to start doing whatever is
[29:33] necessary
[29:35] cut your pluck your eye out cut your
[29:37] hand off
[29:38] in order to put the kingdom of God first
[29:43] whatever it is a job
[29:46] that's making you put the job before God
[29:48] quit the job
[29:50] sell the company
[29:52] it's that serious it should be that
[29:54] serious those things cannot come before
[29:56] God
[29:59] those things what is the Bible what does
[30:01] the Bible say they dull
[30:03] your heart becomes dulled by the cares
[30:06] of this world what does a dull heart do
[30:08] it doesn't have connection with God
[30:12] what else is it becomes lukewarm
[30:14] becomes weak in faith and what is it
[30:17] leading towards it's leading towards
[30:19] shipwreck
[30:22] where is your where is our prayer life
[30:25] let's act that let's let's ask that
[30:26] question where is our walk with God
[30:29] compared to seeking after the needs
[30:32] physical needs that we have in our
[30:35] family has
[30:36] it shouldn't the other things shouldn't
[30:39] come before that
[30:41] before God we put him first
[30:44] many times we go we go go go go for time
[30:47] and we add on add-on add-on and get to
[30:49] the place where like
[30:52] I'm not I'm not putting time I'm not
[30:55] putting God first in my morning I'm not
[30:56] putting God first in my day I've got so
[30:58] much responsibility okay
[31:01] fine you got there have I gotten there
[31:03] many times
[31:05] so you stop you take some time to stop
[31:08] if you have to get away if you have to
[31:10] throw your phone in the river whatever
[31:12] you need to do
[31:15] it so you can reassess where you're at
[31:17] and say okay this is subtracted this is
[31:20] subtracted this is gone this is gone
[31:22] because I can't seek God first when I
[31:25] have all of this or maybe it's not as
[31:27] many things as I mentioned maybe it's
[31:28] just one thing but reassess it and no
[31:31] matter what it is you you put God first
[31:33] I don't think it's going to be your
[31:35] family
[31:36] I don't think it's going to be quitting
[31:38] a job altogether although you may need
[31:40] to quit a job
[31:42] in order to do it if it's making you
[31:44] work on Wednesdays and Sundays
[31:46] but usually it's reassessing your
[31:49] priorities and saying okay this is how
[31:52] it needs to happen moving forward
[31:54] God wants us to be good stewards but he
[31:57] doesn't want that to become our God
[32:00] he wants to be our god so let's let's
[32:02] stand and pray
[32:07] brother Branham says this in enticing
[32:09] Spirits he says give me a preacher give
[32:11] me a Christian
[32:12] give me a housewife that's a Christian
[32:14] give me a farmer or a factory worker
[32:16] that will God put God first in
[32:19] everything I'll show you a man will be
[32:21] successful in spite of all the devil can
[32:24] put on him
[32:27] Heavenly Father we just come before you
[32:28] Lord and our our desire I'm lifting my
[32:31] hand to you and saying Lord I want to
[32:33] put you first in everything
[32:36] Lord cleanse our hearts and cleanse our
[32:39] minds help us to reassess things Lord
[32:41] and
[32:42] and order our lives so that you're first
[32:45] in all things
[32:46] we ask Lord that you be with us today
[32:48] bless the musicians song leader
[32:51] preaching
[32:53] Booth every believer here Lord
[32:56] may your holy spirit guide and direct
[32:58] each one
