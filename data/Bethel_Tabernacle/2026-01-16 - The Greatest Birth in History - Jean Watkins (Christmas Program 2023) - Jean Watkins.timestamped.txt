[0:03] babies.
[0:05] There is uh Judith,
[0:08] Anna,
[0:09] Samuel,
[0:12] uh Hazel, Lana, and little Zoe.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Babies are precious.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:20] &gt;&gt; All babies are precious.
[0:22] But let me tell you the story about the
[0:24] most precious baby
[0:26] &gt;&gt; that's ever been born.
[0:28] In the city of Nazareth in Galilee,
[0:31] there lived a young godly girl, a
[0:34] virgin. Her name was Mary. She was
[0:37] engaged to a godly man named Joseph.
[0:41] And one day as she was going about her
[0:43] house duties, maybe praying, an angel
[0:46] came into her. Hell, thou are highly
[0:50] favored among women. The Lord is with
[0:53] thee. Blessed art thou among women.
[0:56] It scared her. Wouldn't it scare you?
[1:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, if an angel come in, wouldn't it
[1:02] scare you? It scared him.
[1:06] What is going on? Fear not, Mary.
[1:09] I've come to tell you, you're favored of
[1:11] God. You shall conceive in your womb and
[1:14] bear a child, a son, and you shall call
[1:17] his name Jesus.
[1:20] How can this be? I I I'm not married.
[1:25] I've never known a man.
[1:28] The Holy Ghost will come upon you and
[1:31] the power of the highest shall shine
[1:33] upon you
[1:34] &gt;&gt; and that holy thing that's born of you
[1:37] shall be called the son of God.
[1:40] And Mary, your cousin Elizabeth, she's
[1:44] old.
[1:46] She's barren. She's going to have a
[1:48] child, too. Cuz with God, nothing is
[1:51] impossible.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; And Mary said,
[1:56] "Get unto me according unto thy word."
[2:01] And the angel left. And Mary quickly
[2:04] went to see her cousin Elizabeth.
[2:07] While she was gone, I can see Joseph.
[2:10] He's engaged to the most wonderful girl
[2:13] in the world. He thinks, you know, and
[2:16] he thinks I'm a carpenter. I'm going to
[2:20] fix our house up just like I know she
[2:22] will love it. I can't wait for her to
[2:25] get back. I'm so excited to marry this
[2:28] wonderful girl. I can't believe God has
[2:30] so blessed me to find a girl like Mary.
[2:34] And it's time for her to come back.
[2:35] She's been gone three months and here
[2:38] she's coming. He's running out to greet
[2:40] her and he
[2:45] Something's wrong.
[2:48] Something's
[2:50] wrong. Mary, you're expecting a baby and
[2:54] it's not my baby.
[2:57] I I something's wrong. here. Besides,
[3:00] Joseph, an angel come to me and told me
[3:04] that I was the virgin that was going to
[3:06] fulfill this the prophecy that a virgin
[3:09] shall conceive and bring Emanuel, the
[3:10] Christ child, and I'm that virgin.
[3:14] Mary,
[3:16] that prophecy is hundreds of years old.
[3:19] No one thinks about that prophecy
[3:21] anymore. But it's true, Joseph. It's
[3:24] true. The angel Gabriel come and told me
[3:26] that. And I'm expecting a baby.
[3:29] Mary, I I I can't get my I can't get my
[3:33] mind around this. I got to think.
[3:38] There went a way to think.
[3:41] Brokenhearted. When y'all be
[3:43] brokenhearted?
[3:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; The wife, the beautiful virgin girl you
[3:47] going to marry, she's expecting a baby.
[3:50] It's not your baby.
[3:54] I'll put her away. I have to put her
[3:56] away, but I'll do it in secret
[3:59] because we live in Nazareth and it
[4:01] doesn't have the best reputation of
[4:03] being good to people. They'll make her
[4:05] life. They'll probably stone her to
[4:07] death. I can't let that happen. I I will
[4:10] put her away. I'm going to do it in
[4:13] secret.
[4:14] He fell asleep.
[4:17] Very troubled in his mind.
[4:20] Heartbroken. Yeah.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; I mean, all his dreams gone. And an
[4:26] angel come to him. Joseph, thou son of
[4:29] David, don't fear to take unto thee Mary
[4:31] thy wife. That she told you the truth.
[4:34] That which is conceived in her is of the
[4:37] Holy Ghost, and she shall bear a son,
[4:40] and you shall call his name Jesus, for
[4:43] he shall save his people from their
[4:45] sins.
[4:47] And so, Joseph, rise right now and go
[4:51] marry your wife. And he did. But they
[4:54] didn't live together as husband and wife
[4:56] till after Jesus is born. Mary had to be
[4:59] a virgin.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[5:01] &gt;&gt; I can see him. He's fixed up this
[5:04] beautiful little house. And it's their
[5:05] little honeymoon house. And day after
[5:08] day, she's getting larger and larger
[5:10] with child.
[5:12] And and I can see maybe in the afternoon
[5:14] when all the day is done,
[5:17] we're sitting down enjoying each other's
[5:19] company. And I can see Mary one day
[5:22] said, "Joseph, I I'm puzzled about
[5:27] something. I I'm I can't get it off my
[5:30] mind, Joseph. I I wonder how this can
[5:34] be."
[5:36] The prophet said the Messiah, the
[5:38] Emanuel, would be born in Bethlehem of
[5:40] Judea. Joseph, we don't live in
[5:43] Bethlehem. We live in Nazareth.
[5:45] How's that going to happen?
[5:49] I don't know. I wondered it myself. All
[5:53] I know is that the prophets said it that
[5:56] he'd be born in Bethlehem of Judea. We
[5:59] believe the prophets.
[6:01] Nothing is impossible with God. I don't
[6:03] see how it's going to happen.
[6:06] That's what the prophets prophesied. I
[6:09] know, Joseph. I believe it, too. And as
[6:11] time went on, they're learning to live
[6:13] with one another, newlywed, you know,
[6:16] and she's getting larger and larger with
[6:18] child.
[6:20] And all of one day, here come a notice,
[6:24] a decree from the government.
[6:26] Everybody's got to go to the home of
[6:29] their birth,
[6:30] register, and pay taxes. Nobody's
[6:34] excluded. Don't matter your condition.
[6:36] You can be laying dying. You still got
[6:39] to go.
[6:40] How in the world, Joseph, are we going
[6:42] to go? I'm almost ready to be delivered.
[6:46] How we I don't know, Mary, but we got to
[6:50] go because you and I both were born in
[6:52] Bethlehem and I'm in the lineage of the
[6:56] house of David, Bethlehem. We got to go.
[6:59] So, they set out. A lot of other people
[7:02] had to go, too. Very hard trip. 90 miles
[7:06] by foot. took most people four or five
[7:09] days if they walked eight or nine hours
[7:11] a day uh to get there. Well, you can
[7:14] imagine it probably took them twice as
[7:16] long to get there. Now they're going
[7:18] through mountains and valleys and
[7:20] deserts and robbers and wild animals,
[7:23] bad weather. And so I can just see them
[7:26] taking their little donkey and packing
[7:28] up some water and some food and some
[7:31] essentials they have to have on on the
[7:34] way. and they set out for Bethlehem. A
[7:37] lot of other people did too. And of
[7:40] course, Mary and Joseph was left behind
[7:42] cuz there's no way I mean, how far can a
[7:45] 8, nine month expecting a baby girl, how
[7:49] far can she walk in a day?
[7:52] So, they finally come to Little
[7:54] Bethlehem.
[7:56] The place was packed.
[7:59] I mean, packed. People were camping out
[8:02] in the fields. There was it was just
[8:04] people everywhere. See, they they had to
[8:06] come pay taxes, but also the Passover
[8:10] was coming up and 2 million people
[8:12] according to historians say, would come
[8:15] there during Passover. 2 million people.
[8:18] That's a lot. And so when they got to
[8:21] Bethlehem,
[8:24] well then now there's a little in down
[8:26] here.
[8:27] And if they see your situation, Mary,
[8:30] I'm sure they'll find a place. There's
[8:32] no way you can camp out in the field in
[8:34] your situation. And so they went to the
[8:37] end and let's say he was a kind
[8:40] inkeeper.
[8:43] There's nowhere. There's people all over
[8:46] the place. It was impossible for him to
[8:49] fit one more person in.
[8:52] But he could see her situation.
[8:56] Listen.
[8:58] Down over the hill here,
[9:01] there's a stable in a cave. Nobody's in
[9:04] it, just a few animals.
[9:07] And if you'll hurry,
[9:10] go on down there and find that stable
[9:14] in the cave.
[9:37] Obviously
[10:02] they found the cave, the stable in the
[10:05] cave And so I I can see as as Joseph and
[10:09] Mary are going down to find the stable
[10:11] in the cave, they found it. And when
[10:14] they when they went in, it gave them
[10:16] shelter. They didn't have to camp out in
[10:18] the fields. And so when they got in
[10:21] there, I can Mary's beyond walking.
[10:25] She's walk. There's no way she can walk.
[10:27] She's riding the little donkey. And I
[10:29] can see Joseph tenderly taking her off
[10:31] the donkey,
[10:35] setting her down, giving her a drink of
[10:38] water, maybe a little something to eat.
[10:41] I can see him taking the little donkey
[10:42] and taking care of it's tired, too.
[10:45] They're exhausted.
[10:48] And then I can see him taking the straw
[10:50] in the stable
[10:52] in the cave and spreading it out ever so
[10:56] gently, no lumps in it, best he could to
[11:00] lay Mary's poor tired body down.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; And before the night is over,
[11:08] &gt;&gt; baby Jesus is born.
[11:12] And Joseph found swaddling cloth.
[11:17] It's strips of cloth tied together
[11:20] and he wrapped baby Jesus
[11:23] in the swaddling cloth
[11:26] laid him in the manger was a feeding
[11:29] trough. In other word is a manger.
[11:33] About that time on the hill about a mile
[11:36] outside of Bethlehem were shepherds
[11:38] watching over their sheep by night and
[11:41] day.
[11:42] These weren't just ordinary shepherds.
[11:46] These were special shepherds.
[11:49] Some say Levitical shepherds.
[11:52] And they were there because in Bethlehem
[11:55] was the only place in Israel
[11:59] that raised the pascal lambs,
[12:02] the Passover lambs, the sacrificial
[12:06] lambs.
[12:07] Josephus says in Passover they
[12:10] sacrificed 250,000
[12:14] little baby Pascal lambs, special lambs,
[12:18] special shepherds. When the shepherds
[12:20] saw the mother U was fixing to have a
[12:23] baby, the first thing they done was took
[12:25] her to a stable in a cave. And when the
[12:29] baby was born, the first, if it was a
[12:32] little boy, had to be a little boy,
[12:34] they wrapped him in swaddling cloth
[12:38] and laid him in the manger
[12:41] because they had to inspect him. Is he
[12:44] got any broken bones?
[12:46] Is he got any blemishes?
[12:49] Is he got any imperfections? He can't be
[12:51] a pascal lamb if he does.
[12:54] And if he qualified
[12:57] a royal birth, then he was put out with
[13:00] the other Pascal lambs.
[13:04] And all of a sudden that night, an angel
[13:07] appeared and the glory of God shone all
[13:10] around them. And what terrified him? It
[13:12] scared them to death. I mean, that's our
[13:15] terminology. Scared them to death, but
[13:17] it terrified him. And he said, "Fear
[13:20] not. I bring you good tidings of great
[13:23] joy. For unto you this day in the city
[13:26] of David is born Christ the Lord. And
[13:30] you shall find the babe. This will be a
[13:32] shine sign to you. You shall find the
[13:34] babe
[13:35] wrapped in swaddling cloth
[13:39] laying in a manger.
[13:41] The lamb of God.
[13:44] And all of a sudden, the whole sky was
[13:47] heavenly host singing and peace on
[13:49] earth, goodwill towards men. These
[13:52] shepherds were so excited they couldn't.
[13:54] They were beside theelves. They were
[13:56] speechless. We We must go see this. We
[13:59] must go see what the angel said. And And
[14:01] they took off to the stable in the cave.
[14:03] And there he was wrapped in swaddling
[14:07] cloth,
[14:09] laying in a manger. baby Jesus.
[14:14] They went everywhere. Now, this place is
[14:17] packed out with people. They went
[14:20] everywhere telling an angel, "You can't
[14:22] believe it. An angel said this and we
[14:24] went down there and sure enough, he was
[14:25] there." And the people wondered,
[14:29] "What is going on?" They wondered,
[14:31] "Well, of course, they're special
[14:33] shepherds. They got to get back to their
[14:35] special sheep. The Passover's coming up
[14:39] and they got to have these little sheep
[14:41] ready without a blemish, without a
[14:42] broken bone or anything. They're special
[14:45] little sheep, little boy loun.
[14:50] And anyway, at the same time,
[14:54] about the same time that night, there
[14:57] were three wise men
[15:00] way away in the east.
[15:03] And they were there for one purpose, to
[15:05] study the stars, the heavens.
[15:09] We all know that the stars
[15:11] was God's first Bible. And anything that
[15:14] happens in the heavens happens on earth.
[15:17] They knew that. And they were there for
[15:20] the purpose. Like you go to college,
[15:21] like Uriah's going to college, Gideon.
[15:24] It was that was to study the stars, see
[15:28] what's going to happen on Earth. And
[15:30] while they're studying,
[15:34] strange things are begin to happen in
[15:36] the sky.
[15:38] And they notice,
[15:41] did you see that?
[15:43] There's something fixing to happen on
[15:45] earth. Something great, a king is going
[15:48] to be born.
[15:51] And about that time, a new star appeared
[15:54] like they had never saw before. There it
[15:56] is. It's a king. It's the king of the
[15:59] Jews. It's the King of Kings. We're
[16:01] Jews. He's our king. We must go find
[16:06] We must follow this star
[16:08] and we must find this great king.
[16:25] So they packed up whatever they had to
[16:27] pack and
[16:29] and they set out following the star
[16:32] night after night,
[16:35] week after week,
[16:37] month after month
[16:40] through rivers,
[16:42] creeks, deserts, mountains,
[16:47] wild animals, robbers,
[16:50] bad weather, but they kept following
[16:53] that star. They're going to follow till
[16:56] they find that king. And they followed
[16:59] and followed. And finally, they come to
[17:02] Jerusalem. And when they got to
[17:04] Jerusalem, the star left. This is it.
[17:07] This is where he's at. They run around
[17:10] everywhere. Where is he? Where is where
[17:12] is who?
[17:14] The king of the Jews. We saw his star in
[17:17] the east. and we've come to worship him.
[17:21] Where is he? Troubled all Jerusalem.
[17:24] Word got back to King Herod and he was a
[17:27] wicked evil king.
[17:30] Troubled him. He called in all the
[17:32] scribes, all the priests and demanded of
[17:35] them, I want to know where this
[17:37] so-called king,
[17:39] your prophets say he's to be born.
[17:42] Bethlehem of Judea.
[17:46] So then he calls secretly calls him the
[17:48] three wise men and diligently asks them
[17:53] uh when did you say the star first come
[17:56] out? Uh when did you start following
[17:58] this star?
[18:01] Two years two years ago. Took you two
[18:05] years to get here. Well the prophets say
[18:10] he's to be born in Bethlehem of Judea.
[18:13] That's only about six miles down the
[18:15] road here. Just go on down there and
[18:17] when you find him, bring word to me.
[18:21] He's a king. I'm a king. I want to go
[18:24] and worship him, too. So, bring word
[18:26] back to me when you find the young
[18:28] child.
[18:30] They left there just so excited. They
[18:32] were might have been some Pentecostal
[18:35] people shouting and never know, but they
[18:37] were thrilled. And they took off all in
[18:39] that star to Bethlehem
[18:42] and it stopped
[18:44] over a house.
[18:47] Their journey was over.
[18:50] They rejoiced. We finally hear after two
[18:53] hard years.
[18:55] He's here. And when they went into the
[18:58] house, there was the young child Jesus
[19:03] and his mother Mary. And they fell down
[19:06] and they worshiped him.
[19:09] And they gave him their gifts. Gold,
[19:12] frankincense, marrow.
[19:18] That is the most precious baby that's
[19:21] ever been born on this earth. Our savior
[19:25] Emmanuel, God with us, the Lord Jesus
[19:29] Christ. Thank y'all. A bless.
