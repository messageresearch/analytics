[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good to be here this morning to be with you for those of you who don't know me i'm brother tim calhoun from manchester tennessee a pastoral church there called the assembly of bible christians and want to greet you from the assembly of bible christians this morning if you want to stand with just a moment we'll have a word of prayer our gracious kind and loving father we're so thankful to be here this morning lord jesus we thank you that you woke us up and gave us life and breath and joy and peace father god most of all that you the holy spirit lord dwelling within us leading and guiding and directing our thoughts our words and our deeds and so lord this morning as we come to bring a teaching for your children father you have your way we submit ourself body spirit and soul unto thee for lord god only you can help us and lord we come before your throne of mercy and grace asking you heavenly father that you will come and speak now in the name of jesus christ we ask it amen if you want to look at scripture with us out of the book of revelation we'll look at revelation chapter 20. just read the first few verses there for our scriptural background what we want to talk about this morning revelation 20 beginning with verse 1 we'll read down oh let's see okay oh i forgot turn it on okay sorry about that all right so we'll read down from verse 1 down to verse 7. it says and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit in a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads are in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priest of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison so the lord god bless you may be seated this morning um and we will also uh take a look at chapter 21 there in the book of revelation starting with verse 1. give the brothers just a minute to catch up we didn't have time to get everything together 21 verse 1 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of say heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god so this morning let's go on to verse 4 there brothers and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away okay and then let's jump over to uh 22. and let's see we will start at verse 1 and we will go through verse 5. and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb and in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bear twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever so this morning in our reading we're reading about the great and precious promises that have been given to the children the family of god so you know that first promise is the millennium the millennium reign a thousand years on this earth you and i living and ruling and reigning with almighty god no sickness no sorrow no pain no death nothing hurts nothing destroys everything in perfection back like it was there in the garden of eden then the next stop is the new jerusalem and in that new jerusalem that's the eternal kingdom after satan has been completely and totally annihilated nothing left no more sin no more no more coming of anybody to rise up against god and his family and to live eternally and dwell eternally with our heavenly father ruling and reigning over all the universe with our lord and savior us together with him ruling and reigning so now today in our teaching this day i have a question for you and that is who wants to take the flight to the wedding supper the millennium then the new jerusalem so would you say does everybody in here want to take that flight this morning does that matter okay so we're 100 beautiful beautiful um okay well that's just awesome because the flight leaves here in three hours okay so the flight's leaving in three hours and boarding begins in 20 minutes okay so boarding boarding for the flight begins in 20 minutes and final boarding call is in two hours and 30 minutes so you've got the next two and a half hours to be in perfect shape to get out of here you must get on this flight if you want to go to these destinations this is the only flight going and there will not be any alternative flights um on this flight there's no luggage compartment so only what you're wearing and you got one single carry-on bag that's all that's all you're allowed that's it and there are only certain items that you're allowed on this flight so you can't just take anything there's only certain things that are allowed so on this flight all right so now remember this is a flight okay so there's some requirements okay there's some requirements if you want to take this fight now everybody here said they wanted to take this flight if you want to take this flight you'll have to go through the x-ray machine the mri machine the cat scan machine and the sonogram machine so you're going to be fully scoped from top to bottom inside outside everything also you have to submit to a temperature check an oral exam and a scan for fleas ticks bed bugs and any other parasites okay and there's a required blood test it is done at the boarding desk and one final thing you must have your inoculation certificate and note that only this certificate that is verified by the holy ghost is acceptable all others they're they're not accepted so it doesn't matter where you got it uh you know you can go online and and download or but it's only the one that the holy ghost verifies is that's the only one accepted also only certain clothing is allowed you won't be allowed any socks or hoes or shoes oh it's because all the clothing is provided if you pass all the exams if you pass the exams you don't have to worry about your clothing it's all provided all right here's a list of the exams of the of the items that are allowed in your carry-on bag uh galatians chapter 5 verses 22 and 23 these are allowed in your bag okay so galatians 5 verses 22 and 23. everybody got it all right it says but the fruit of the spirit so you can carry some fruit on this flight the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law so there's no law that can prevent you from taking these on the trip second peter chapter one verses three through eight all right so this this trip if you want to take this trip these are the only things that that can be carried now we're giving you the list of things that you can put in your bag and take with you ii peter 1 3-8 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto the life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue so see this flight this is the flight that's taking us to glory okay so he's called us to that but now here is the things that's required okay so if it's given unto us then if he's got a requirement then then he has to provide don't he all right so next verse brothers and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith oh so first you've got to have faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful so again we're talking about fruits right unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ so now this is not the knowledge that you go down to the local schoolhouse or the local college or the online college to to get you you don't that that's not the getting place the apostle peter here has told us that this is in the divine nature and the and you have to go to where that's at it's not down here at the schoolhouse it's not at the theological seminary and you know what it's not right here in this church you say oh but it's not it's not here in the church building but it better be in the church next verse there brother for if these things be in you and abound they make you shall neither be barren unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ we're going to go one other place we're going to go matthew chapter 6 verses 9 through 15. matthew 6 9 through 15. so again if you want to take that flight now this is the flight that's bound for the wedding supper for the millennium and for the new jerusalem so it's the only fly going there's not another one that you can can get on there's no alternative flight this is the only flight going and like we said in two hours and a half final boarding so you know you got to be ready it's not not something you can wait and make tomorrow it's it's today so you got to be ready to get on this flight now understand that there are two other flights okay i will tell you that there are two other flights all right so there is another flight that we'll be leaving later we don't know exactly when that one's going to be okay but that flight its destination is first stop and it's required you have to de-plane is the tribulation okay and so you you have to take you have to de-plane you have to get off and then once the tribulation is finished you get back on that flight and now it's going to fly for a thousand years and then it'll finally reach its destination and you know what that destination is it's called the white throne judgment now this particular flight okay this particular flight the final destination is has two separate places okay it has a place called the sea of glass where there's part of them going to go and then it has a destination called outside the city where the rest of them are going to go so it's in heaven it has a final destination of heaven but you have to go through the tribulation and you have to stay with the dead for a thousand years and then you're brought up and then there is the final flight it's the final flight so everybody that misses flight one and flight number two they go in flight number three and flight number three's destination is also the tribulation and then the final stop is white throne judgment and there their destination is actually the lake of fire so you're the one who makes the choice now you're the one who makes a choice not even god makes that choice did you know that you make that choice because he said whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely and so if you will to do it then he has to provide it don't he but if you don't will to do it then he has provided and you chose not to so all of those that want to get on that first flight you've got two and a half hours boarding starts here in about 10 minutes and you got two hours beyond that all right so you can't take on board any food or drink as the food and drink is all provided on the flight at no charge oh by the way this plane there's no ticket that you can purchase you have to go through the exams and once you go through the exams and pass the exams then you have the right to board the flight otherwise you you do not have right to board the flight okay all right so everybody has has witnessed that they want to take flight on that first plane that takes them to the wedding supper and the millennium and to dwell eternally in the new jerusalem okay all right so boarding is ready to begin and the line begins at the altar okay all of the exams are done here okay there's no no no there's no you don't have you can't go any other place and get you can't get an mri done somewhere else you can't get an x-ray from someone it's all done here okay and there's four guards that handles those exams okay there's a line of ox a man an eagle and they handle all examinations and so once you're cleared by those examinations then you have the movement that you can go forward but remember here's here's some quick requirements so you can start taking the test john 3 verses 1 through 21 don't have time to go through them but if anybody in here doesn't know what saint john 3 the first 21 verses is shame on you okay matthew 5 verses 1 through 16 and verse 48 okay acts 2 verses 36 through 42. so those are your requirements you have to have those okay so anybody that's got those requirements now i'm not going to read them out anybody's got those requirements it's ready to board without these requirements you cannot get on board the flight now this boarding pass the line the ox the man and the eagle that you have to pass through that's your that's your exams okay those that mri that x-ray that cat scan that sonogram you know you just can't take anything with you you know i don't know what to say friends except you know if you got anything that's not allowed with you you can't get through the machine it rejects you okay uh it and it's not the lion's fault it's not the ox's fault or the man's fault or the eagle's fault it's yours because it's whatever you're holding on to okay it's not they don't have nothing to do with it all they're doing is putting the test and then then it's up to you to pass the test you you've got the requirements right right you you've got you've got the bible right you've you've got that you've been provided that okay just wanted to be sure you'd be been provided those things i thought brother jason told me he you know y'all were well provided for down here and and and i knew you were all right and again this flight is free of charge don't cost you nothing you can get on there all you got to do is let go of anything that would hinder you from getting on the fly and the boarding agent okay the boarding agent is the only one that can give you access to get on the fly that's the final judge it's not the line it's not the ox it's not the man it's not the eagle they're just the testing people they provide the test and and once you get through their test they just give you the certificate and you pass on but it's the boarding agent that's standing there at the door where that blood test is going to be done that's the person that gives you full access to the flight okay so everybody that wants to get on this flight it's available to you today and like i said boarding begins you know the altar you you go you pass through the altar you can't remember how it was i'm sure that uh brother jason's had plenty of examples of the ark of the covenant and the new the tabernacle in the wilderness and all those kind of things that y'all have seen and been taught in and if you remember you come in the eastern gate right and when you come in the eastern gate what's the first thing the altar so that's the axis you got to go through the altar and and then once you pass the altar then you enter into the next phase to get to the the holy place and that's where those line ox man and eagle that's where that's where they do those final tests and then standing at that door to the holy of holies is where that boarding agent is at okay and so if you make it through all of those and there's really no reason for you not to unless you want to take some of these things here you got matthew chapter 5 verses 17 through 47. you got second corinthians 12 verses 19 through 21. revelations third i mean romans 13 verses 7 through 14. first timothy chapter 6 james chapter 3 and galatians chapter 5. now i know that's a lot of of of reading there but uh i'll i'll be here after service if anybody wants to talk to me about what those were but those are disqualifying items okay um i've tried to give you the qualified items the ones that'll qualify you so that you know that's the ones that matter these that disqualify they really don't matter if you just let go because that's all you got to do you just drop it in the garbage as you go by it's no big deal but now if you won't let go then you just can't get through the examination you know that x-ray screen it it it shows everything whatever you got in your pockets and in in in your shoes and what you got in your hair and you know if you got a belt on it it'll even show up that stuff you swallow and boy that mri you better not have nothing magnetic on you because boy when that thing goes it goes squirreling around you it's it'll it'll it'll snatch that magnetic stuff problems now that cat scan's pretty slick because it even goes inside your skull and checks all that you know that funny stuff out inside your head and that sonogram it checks out all these innards in here you know figures out whether or not you got good digestion or not so in other words what have you been eating you know you've been eating good stuff or not so you get through those tests and then the last thing is that blood test and you know that one's simple it's just a little prick of your finger you know it ain't no big deal they just wipe it you know see be sure you got the right kind of blood that's all so this morning who wants to take the flight amen see it's really not that complicated to go to heaven is it it's really not a big deal is it it's just like getting on an airplane at the airport you just got to be prepared but now the challenge about this flight is just like i said at the beginning it takes off today and you say brother tim are you saying the rapture is today absolutely it's today today's the day there's no other day you ain't got any other choice and you say but i thought nobody's supposed to know the day they're in the hour according to my bible today is the day of salvation right what does your say so there's no other day if we want to get on the flight today's the day to make your choice today's the day to set aside yourself as the one that's going to go don't worry about that person sitting beside you worry about you now once you get you ready to go then you think about your loved ones and stuff but until the boarding agent says you are ready to go i wouldn't worry about anybody else i wouldn't worry about what the pastor's wife's doing or what the pastor's doing or what the deacon's wife's doing or what the deacon's doing or what their kids are doing or what the prophet's family is doing or anybody else be concerned about you and you alone because you know that prophet that we that we talk about he said you got to be to such a place that if anybody in this church is going it's you so i'm here to tell you this morning if he comes and there's only one going out of this church today i'm sorry y'all but it's me because i'm here today y'all understand that's the way i believe it wherever i'm at i'm listening and when he calls i will answer because that boarding agent i got him on board we're walking together so this morning it's just sort of a word of encouragement but a checkup what if it was right now are you ready to go because if you're not that's a problem now that don't mean that you might not have made a mistake 10 minutes ago but when you made the mistake did you repent amen be zealous therefore and repent that's what the message is to the bride of this day when you make a mistake repent don't keep going in it repent why because nobody knows the day nor the hour so what would you do if the bell rang for you to get on board right now god bless you
