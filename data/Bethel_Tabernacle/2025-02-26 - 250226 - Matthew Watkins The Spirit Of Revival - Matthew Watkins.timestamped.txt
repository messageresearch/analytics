[5:21] [Music]
[5:30] changing to Heat. Heat. Heat.
[5:34] [Applause]
[5:49] Oh, God's
[5:55] unchanging. Amen. Let me turn up them
[5:58] speakers a little bit. I'm just kidding.
[6:01] I was too busy back there. I didn't hear
[6:03] him. Praise the Lord. I like to sing.
[6:06] Like to get in the
[6:08] spirit. Get this thing out of the way.
[6:12] My wife told me the other day when I was
[6:14] u talking about that nun's testimony,
[6:16] she said, "You left us hanging. What was
[6:19] going on?" The the name of the testimony
[6:23] was, "You got to stop the Catholic
[6:25] Church." And she was a nun for many,
[6:28] many years. Started at
[6:31] 18. And I told you before, she had all
[6:33] these rituals and stuff that they went
[6:35] through. their whole day was planned
[6:37] out, fasting, prayer for this long and
[6:40] all this. So, one time she went down to
[6:42] pray at the
[6:43] altar and things started to get dark on
[6:46] her and
[6:47] um she actually stopped breathing. She
[6:51] could hear the other nuns saying that,
[6:53] you know, trying to help her, call the
[6:55] ambulance and stuff, but she couldn't
[6:57] see
[6:58] anything. And that's when she started to
[7:00] see the presence of God. She went and
[7:04] um she said, you know, and she never
[7:07] spoke, but it was like I did this and he
[7:09] and he it would come back with the word
[7:11] of God. She came out of that. I mean it
[7:15] and in the hospital room she saw the
[7:17] ceiling of the hospital room and they
[7:20] had said she'd been clinically dead for
[7:21] like 2 and 1/2 minutes. And when she's
[7:24] testifying, you'd think that the stuff
[7:25] she was testifying would take a long
[7:27] time. Of course, she never went back to
[7:29] the Catholic church and she all she
[7:31] could do was go and testify about Jesus
[7:35] because that's what she was pointed to
[7:37] when she went through that. You know, we
[7:39] don't know where all of his children
[7:42] are, and she may never become bride, but
[7:47] in that situation, God reached down and
[7:51] put her in the hospital, showed her
[7:53] these things that the Catholic Church
[7:55] was just a bunch of idolatry worship and
[7:58] stuff, and delivered her from
[8:01] it. So, I hope nobody's hanging anymore.
[8:04] That was the end of the story. Amen.
[8:07] Let's pray.
[8:09] Father, we love you this evening. Lord,
[8:11] we are so thankful that you are the same
[8:13] yesterday, today and forever without any
[8:16] shadow of turning, Lord. And Father, we
[8:20] come with confidence knowing that you
[8:22] are here in our midst. And Lord, if we
[8:25] just open our hearts and let the
[8:28] floodgates of heaven, you want to fill
[8:30] us more than we want to be filled. So we
[8:32] come to you believing that, asking you
[8:34] to help us, Father, to step into your
[8:37] presence. allow you to have your way.
[8:39] Bless the tithes and offerings. And
[8:41] Lord, we pray for those that are sick
[8:43] this
[8:44] evening.
[8:46] Father, when you're sick, you can
[8:48] realize how other people feel. And I
[8:51] pray for each and every one of them.
[8:52] Father, I pray that you help
[8:54] him, Lord. And as I pray for brother
[8:57] Charles, Father, and with his knee, his
[9:01] ankle, things going on, Father, I lift
[9:03] him up before you, Father. In the name
[9:05] of Jesus Christ, I pray that you would
[9:07] touch his body, Lord, cuz we believe
[9:10] that you are a healer, Lord. By your
[9:12] stripes, we are
[9:14] healing. Praise and worship you this
[9:16] evening. Bless the breaking of the bread
[9:18] to our hearts, we pray. And bless those
[9:20] that are streaming, Lord. Reach out and
[9:22] touch our hearts, Father. In Jesus' name
[9:24] we pray. Amen.
[9:29] Amen. This time, we'll ask Sister Emily.
[9:32] She has a special and uh we can y'all be
[9:36] be seated.
[9:47] [Music]

[10:31] riches
[10:35] untold. I'd
[10:37] rather have

[10:46] land. I'd
[10:48] rather be
[10:51] led by his name. will pierce

[11:13] held in
[11:17] sous way.
[11:23] I'd
[11:25] rather have
[11:28] Jesus than
[11:34] anything. This
[11:36] world
[11:39] affords today.
[11:42] [Music]
[11:45] I'd
[11:47] rather have
[11:50] Jesus than
[11:56] Vince. I'd
[11:58] rather be
[12:01] faithful to
[12:04] his dear cause.
[12:10] I'd
[12:12] rather have
[12:15] Jesus than

[12:22] I'd

[13:10] world
[13:13] affords
[13:18] today. This
[13:21] world
[13:24] a today.
[13:28] [Music]
[13:36] And it's one of my favorite songs. I
[13:38] really appreciate that. Um, uh, do we
[13:42] have the lyrics, Sister Zoe, for a song
[13:44] called I Need You More More Than
[13:47] Yesterday? My sister sent me this song
[13:50] today while I was at work. She's like,
[13:52] "Can we I want to sing this. Will you
[13:54] sing it with me? And here's the link to
[13:55] it." I said, "Yeah, you know, if I get a
[13:57] chance." So, I practiced it and then she
[14:00] texted the group chat right before
[14:02] service that um she wasn't going to sing
[14:05] it after all. Uh but I left my phone at
[14:07] the house and I didn't see it. So, I
[14:10] don't know
[14:11] that. Um but, uh we all the musicians
[14:16] decided that we were going to sing it
[14:17] together. So, if you could make sure
[14:19] they have mics. Um it's a pretty simple
[14:23] chorus. Um hopefully we have the words
[14:24] all can sing along. It's pretty simple.
[14:27] Um, it's a congregational. We got it.
[14:28] Um, we'll start with the chorus and uh
[14:32] y'all can sing along and uh if you if
[14:36] you want to
[14:40] um I need you
[14:44] [Music]
[14:47] more, more than
[14:50] yesterday. I need you more.
[14:55] [Music]
[14:58] More than words can say, I need you
[15:07] more than
[15:10] ever before. I need you,
[15:17] Lord. I need you, Lord.
[15:22] [Music]
[15:24] I need you
[15:28] [Music]
[15:30] more more than
[15:33] yesterday. I need you
[15:36] [Music]
[15:41] more than words can say. I need you
[15:49] [Music]
[15:50] more than
[15:52] ever before. I need you,
[15:59] Lord. I need you,
[16:05] Lord. More than the air I breathe.
[16:11] More than the song I
[16:16] sing, more than the next
[16:20] [Music]
[16:22] heartbeat. More than
[16:27] anything, more than as time goes
[16:32] by, be by your side.
[16:40] Because I never want to go back to my
[16:46] old
[16:48] life. I need you
[16:56] more than
[16:59] yesterday. I need you.
[17:04] [Music]
[17:07] more than words can say. I need you
[17:16] more than
[17:18] ever
[17:20] before. I need you,
[17:25] Lord. I need you,
[17:31] Lord. I need you, Lord.
[17:36] [Music]
[17:39] more than
[17:41] yesterday. I need
[17:48] you more than words can say. I need you
[17:59] [Music]
[18:00] more before. I need you,
[18:07] Lord. I need you,
[18:11] Lord. Let's
[18:14] stand as we change the words of
[18:17] service. I want to sing
[18:19] um Spirit of the Living God, Fall Fresh
[18:22] on Me. This book says F. I don't know if
[18:25] that's accurate.
[18:27] um as we invite the minister and um
[18:30] y'all be praying. Um uh several of our
[18:33] people are out sick. Uh brother Jason
[18:35] out. Um last I heard he was going to
[18:38] have to forgo ministering tonight cuz he
[18:40] was feeling so under the weather and um
[18:42] brother Tony is out. Um which is why I'm
[18:44] up here. Um but uh keep everybody in
[18:48] prayer and I know it's going through and
[18:50] just that you know would stop here and
[18:52] not go any further and you know keep
[18:54] anybody else from getting sick.
[18:56] Um and so as we invite the minister out
[18:59] uh to bring the word um let's sing this
[19:05] song key of
[19:07] F. Spirit
[19:10] of the living
[19:15] God
[19:17] fall fresh on me.

[20:43] Let's change that up.
[20:45] [Music]
[20:48] Uh do um give me a B flat if you don't
[20:51] mind
[20:54] me. On a
[20:56] hill far
[20:59] away stood an
[21:02] old rugged
[21:06] cross.
[21:12] Yeah.
[21:22] Heat. Heat.
[21:32] Heat.
[21:35] Yeah.
[21:45] Heat.
[21:52] Heat. Heat.
[22:07] Heat. Heat.
[22:26] [Music]
[22:35] Oh, by the
[22:45] world for
[22:51] me.
[22:53] Yeah.
[23:03] Heat.
[23:05] Yeah.
[23:15] Heat. Yeah. Heat.
[23:40] to
[23:46] the
[23:48] exchange and
[23:50] exchange
[23:52] it for. Can we sing it one more time to
[23:57] the Lord? Now let's raise our hands. So
[23:59] I'll cherish
[24:05] So
[24:22] you Heat. Heat.
[24:35] and
[24:37] exchange
[24:39] something
[24:41] for a
[24:47] [Music]
[24:49] Do you feel that way? Amen. One day
[24:51] we'll exchange it. You believe that?
[24:53] Amen. How does how many does that cross
[24:55] How many would say, "Lord, that that
[24:57] cross doesn't just mean something in the
[24:59] past, something that happened a long
[25:01] time ago, but it stands for a meaning, a
[25:03] value today." Amen. The reason why I'm
[25:06] why I'm here is because of that old
[25:09] rugged cross. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[25:12] We just want to say uh welcome to the
[25:13] house of the Lord tonight. We got many
[25:15] that are sick and away and uh just not
[25:18] able to be here. Just different ones
[25:20] struggling with physical sickness. And
[25:21] so I know my dad is suffering and also
[25:24] talked to brother Tony and I think
[25:26] Annelise also and different ones. I'm
[25:28] sure many that aren't here tonight. So
[25:30] we just want to remember them in prayer.
[25:32] Amen. Also good to have brother Steve.
[25:35] Amen. Sister Emily back. It's all so
[25:37] awesome hearing that special back there.
[25:39] Amen. So glad uh to have them back with
[25:41] us. You love the Lord Jesus.
[25:44] Amen. Why don't we turn to the book of
[25:46] Revelations chapter 3. If we have our
[25:48] Bible, we'll turn there. Revelations
[25:52] [Music]
[25:55] 3.
[25:59] Amen. We just want to begin reading
[26:01] here. We'll just begin Revelations
[26:03] chapter 3. Really familiar, but I just
[26:05] want to pick up a couple verses.
[26:09] Amen. We'll just begin reading here at
[26:12] verse 14. I want to preach to you
[26:14] tonight, and I'm going to title this the
[26:16] spirit of revival. the spirit of
[26:22] revival and under the angel of the
[26:25] church of the lady of right these things
[26:28] saith the amen the faithful and true
[26:30] witness the beginning of the creation of
[26:33] God I know thy works that thou art
[26:36] neither cold nor hot I would thou work
[26:40] cold or hot so then because thou art
[26:43] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[26:46] spew thee out of my mouth mouth because
[26:49] thou sayest, I am rich and increase with
[26:53] goods and have need of nothing. Could
[26:55] you imagine what a condition? That's why
[26:57] brother Brandham said it was one of the
[26:59] most pitiful scriptures in the Bible.
[27:02] Because he said they looked at their own
[27:05] self in the mirror and this is what they
[27:08] seen. Because thou sayest, verse 17, I
[27:11] am rich, and increase with goods, and
[27:14] have need of nothing, and knowest not
[27:18] that thou art wretched, and miserable,
[27:21] and poor, and blind, and naked. Verse
[27:25] 18, I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[27:29] tried in the fire, that thou mayest be
[27:31] rich, and white ramnant, that thou
[27:33] mayest be clothed, and that the shame of
[27:36] thy nakedness do not appear. and anoint
[27:39] thine eyes with Isav that thou mayest
[27:42] see. As many as I love, I say, "It's
[27:47] okay. It's all right. I'll wink at it.
[27:51] It'll be okay." No. God says that the
[27:54] Bible says that the son that doesn't re
[27:56] receive correction is a bastard. Meaning
[27:58] that only real true sons God corrects
[28:03] because only true sons can be corrected.
[28:05] Aren't you glad that you got something
[28:07] in you that when your father comes down
[28:09] and chasens you, you don't resist, you
[28:12] don't recoil, but you just say, "Yes,
[28:14] Lord. Yes, Father. You know what I
[28:16] need?" Amen. That means that you're a
[28:18] son and a daughter of God. He says, "As
[28:20] many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. Be
[28:24] zealous,
[28:26] therefore, and repent." Verse 20,
[28:29] "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[28:33] If any man hear my voice and open the
[28:36] door, I will come into him and will suck
[28:39] with him and he with me. Now remember,
[28:41] brother Brandham shows us that he was
[28:43] never in the church until this lady age.
[28:48] He was always outside of the church. But
[28:50] he says when he restored himself through
[28:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, not the
[28:54] true new birth, but the baptism on the
[28:57] flesh, the gifts of the spirit. Brother
[28:59] Brandham said under that lady church he
[29:02] said now Christ was in the church and
[29:05] they received his spirit but now somehow
[29:08] he's outside of that church his own
[29:10] church and he's knocking on the door and
[29:12] brother Brandham said it was because
[29:14] they accepted the signs but they kicked
[29:16] him out by kicking his word out and
[29:18] saying it's a false prophet we don't
[29:20] needed anything to do with it and
[29:21] brother Brandham says now you find him
[29:24] outside of his own church and he's
[29:26] knocking on the door. Now listen what he
[29:28] says here. And he says him, he says
[29:30] here, "Behold, I stand at the door and
[29:32] knock. If any man hear my voice and open
[29:35] the door, I will come into him and will
[29:39] suck with him and he with me." To him,
[29:42] aren't you glad there's somebody that
[29:44] overcometh? How many want to say, "Lord,
[29:46] I believe it's going to be me." Amen. To
[29:48] him that overcomemeth will I grant to
[29:50] sit with me in my throne, even as I also
[29:54] overcame, and am set down with my father
[29:58] in his throne. He that hath an ear, let
[30:00] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[30:03] churches. Lord, we're glad that we have
[30:05] a receiving heart, an ear to hear, Lord.
[30:08] But more than all of that, I just want
[30:10] to say thank you, Lord, that you still
[30:12] speak. Father, I pray that you would
[30:15] come and make yourself real to your
[30:17] children. Lord God, for every person
[30:19] that's not able to be here tonight under
[30:22] sickness, Lord, of various kinds. Some
[30:24] with the flu, others with different kind
[30:26] of infections. Lord, I'm remembering
[30:28] also our sister Sarah Y, Lord, in the
[30:31] hospital at this very moment. God, we
[30:33] believe that you are still Jehovah Rafa.
[30:36] You're still the healer of our body. I
[30:38] pray, God, that you would come in a
[30:39] special way, Lord. uh just reach out in
[30:42] faith and I pray God that you would
[30:44] touch brother sister Sarah Lord and
[30:46] brother Brad Father there with her. I
[30:48] pray God that you would renew her
[30:49] strength Lord. May there just be a
[30:52] complete healing Father of whatever this
[30:54] situation is Lord God. I pray that you'd
[30:56] move on the scene. We ask it now Lord
[30:59] take us Lord one and all Father as we
[31:01] just pull up a chair to your table. Lord
[31:03] we come Father to be fed of you now God.
[31:06] I pray that you would just look at our
[31:08] look at our own humanity, our own
[31:09] weakness. Lord, there's nothing good,
[31:12] Father, inside of us except what you put
[31:14] inside of us. I pray, God, that you'd
[31:16] bless us now, one and all. We pray in
[31:18] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can be
[31:23] seated. We know that this is what the
[31:26] prophet of God teaches us here, and I've
[31:27] read it here in Revelations chapter 3,
[31:30] that that it was that God was going to
[31:33] send something very special uh when he
[31:35] sent the Holy Ghost. Let me just pull up
[31:37] my uh my notes here just for a moment.
[31:40] And I didn't send that. You can just um
[31:43] you can keep that. We we won't have any
[31:45] kind of slides here tonight. But I want
[31:46] to I just want to read you something
[31:48] that brother Adam said that just stirred
[31:50] me. It grabbed my attention as I know
[31:53] you've heard it before, but I just want
[31:55] to read it before you and uh and just
[31:58] let it sort of set the tone for what the
[32:00] Lord has for us tonight. Did you come
[32:02] expecting? Amen. Listen what brother
[32:04] Adam says here in the message in 1963 in
[32:07] August. How can I overcome? He says now
[32:11] I chose this because that I think that
[32:14] it's a time that we should never let the
[32:17] spirit of revival die. Amen. We've got
[32:21] to keep in revival constantly revived
[32:25] every day. Paul said he had to die daily
[32:29] that Christ could live. And we must
[32:33] never let that revival die within us. I
[32:39] think that's so profound. It's never a
[32:41] time, Brother Brandham says it's a time
[32:43] that we should never let the spirit of
[32:47] revival die. I'm preaching to you
[32:50] tonight by the Lord's help on the spirit
[32:52] of revival. We know that brother
[32:55] Brandham teaches us that this word
[32:56] revive is not something that God gives
[32:59] us new uh necessarily or adds to us. But
[33:02] a revival speaks of something that is
[33:05] dead that needs to be revived. In fact,
[33:08] if you go and look up the word revival,
[33:11] it means to bring back to life that
[33:14] which is in risk of becoming a corpse. I
[33:18] thought that was amazing when I read it.
[33:20] that revival means to bring back to life
[33:24] something that is in risk of becoming a
[33:28] corpse. Now we know that brother Benham
[33:31] says that the last me the last um spirit
[33:35] that comes the last plague that comes to
[33:38] the church is spiritual death. How many
[33:40] knows that it's it's a it's a spiritual
[33:43] death. Not a death naturally that we're
[33:45] speaking of, but a spiritual death by a
[33:48] death messenger would be the last plague
[33:51] that would fall. We find that in type in
[33:53] Egypt when the very last uh plague that
[33:56] falls in Egypt is the death angel. How
[33:59] many remember that? And and the only the
[34:02] the that all of those that were were not
[34:04] under the blood under the token were not
[34:07] spared. Listen, let me just say this
[34:09] that that that death that spiritual
[34:12] death won't discriminate based on how
[34:15] good you are of a person, how nice you
[34:17] are of a person, how good your church
[34:19] attendance is, how much you pay in
[34:21] tithes, what your last name is, how
[34:24] popular you how popular that you are. Uh
[34:26] he only he won't discriminate on any of
[34:29] that. The only thing that he looks for
[34:32] is the blood.
[34:34] And I'm glad that we've got the token.
[34:35] Aren't you glad tonight we've got the
[34:37] token. Brother Vam says here, he says,
[34:39] let me just read it again. And we must
[34:41] never let that revival die within us.
[34:46] So, we could look at this word revival
[34:48] and we could think of the past revivals
[34:50] and we could preach on those past
[34:52] revivals. You've had many of them come
[34:55] throughout even just our modern era. You
[34:57] could look at the Isuza revival. You can
[34:59] look even uh prior to that was a great
[35:02] healing revival that takes place. But
[35:04] but let me just say that I believe that
[35:06] God has a revival for us here today in
[35:10] this generation. That revival isn't not
[35:12] a thing that God did uh 50 years ago or
[35:15] even 60 years ago. But revival is
[35:18] something that must happen on an
[35:20] individual basis to every person that
[35:23] claims to be a Christian. We've got to
[35:25] have as brother Brandham says, we must
[35:27] let the never let the spirit of revival
[35:31] die. We must never let as as brother
[35:33] Adam says it that way. He says we should
[35:35] never let the revival die the revival
[35:38] within us. I was hearing brother Adam
[35:40] say this in how can I overcome and I
[35:42] just thought it was so good and he
[35:44] talked about a log that he seen a great
[35:46] big log and he was going to jump on into
[35:48] the water and he seen that log laying
[35:51] there and he said I'm I'm you know I can
[35:53] thought it looked good from the outside.
[35:55] So he jumps off the bank and he lands on
[35:57] the log. But he says, "I realized when I
[36:00] landed on the log that he said that it
[36:02] that he said it was all eaten and rotten
[36:04] from the inside, just had an outer
[36:06] core." How many ever seen that before in
[36:08] the woods, you know, the tree that looks
[36:10] strong, but as you get close to it, he
[36:12] says that the tree is actually rotten
[36:14] and that that the entire inside of it
[36:16] completely gone. And brother Adam says,
[36:18] "I think it," he says, "I thought it was
[36:20] so amazing." And he said, "Because here
[36:22] it was lo a log right by the river which
[36:26] is the source of life yet it was dead."
[36:29] And brother Brandon brings out something
[36:31] so amazing about that. He says,
[36:32] "Notice." And he says, "That's what
[36:34] happens to a Christian when he loses the
[36:38] revival, when he loses the joy of the
[36:40] Lord, when he loses the spirit of
[36:43] gladness." Now, I'm talking about a
[36:45] believer here. This isn't not talking
[36:46] about an unbeliever or a a sinner. I'm
[36:49] talking about a real believer, a real
[36:51] person who's been born again by the
[36:53] spirit of God. Brother Brandon says,
[36:54] "But you get away from the life source.
[36:57] You get away from the joy of the Lord,
[37:00] the gladness of his spirit." And he
[37:02] says, "You lose that power of the
[37:04] spirit." And he says, "What happens? You
[37:06] begin to rot from the inside. And all
[37:09] the outside looks good. And all the
[37:11] outside continues with the form, but on
[37:13] the inside, it's null and void of true
[37:16] life." And brother Bam says, 'I think
[37:18] that's the way it is just about like a
[37:21] Christian who gets away from God. He
[37:23] begins to rot. But he says, notice, a
[37:26] Christian by the river will rot twice as
[37:30] fast as a tree that was never planted by
[37:34] the rivers of the water in the first
[37:35] place. All right. And brother Brandham
[37:37] says that's why he says you would have
[37:39] been better to be a Lutheran and stay a
[37:42] Lutheran than to move on past that into
[37:45] the present light. Because when you come
[37:47] into the present light, Brother Brandham
[37:49] says, "But you don't have the life of
[37:51] revival, you die twice as fast." Amen.
[37:57] Uh, Brother Brandham says this here in
[37:58] Why Christ speak? I thought it was just
[38:00] such a good quote. I just wanted to read
[38:02] it. And he says, "What ought that to do
[38:04] to us?" Now listen to what brother
[38:06] Brandham says here. We need a
[38:08] repentance. We need a revival. And
[38:12] brother Brandham says, "I'm saying
[38:14] myself. I need a shaking. I need
[38:18] something. I said I was speaking to
[38:20] myself." Think about it. Here's brother
[38:22] Brandham in 1963 after the seals. And
[38:25] he's saying, "I'm looking at myself
[38:28] saying I need something myself this
[38:32] morning."
[38:33] I think if brother Brandham could be
[38:35] that honest, if a prophet could be that
[38:37] honest, how much more ought we to be
[38:39] able to be honest with oursel and say,
[38:41] 'Lord, I need a revival.
[38:44] Amen. I need a shaking. How many would
[38:46] say that? I need something. I said I was
[38:49] speaking to myself this morning, I need
[38:53] awakening up. Yes. Amen. It's incredible
[38:56] to me because when you think about the
[38:59] spirit of God that baptizes you into the
[39:01] body and you're sealed, but the Bible
[39:04] says, "Grieve not the spirit whereby you
[39:08] are sealed unto the day of your
[39:10] redemption." Brother Brandham says, "Or
[39:12] that means you are sealed until you are
[39:15] fully redeemed."
[39:17] So we know that all of us here as
[39:19] believers talking about Christians that
[39:22] if you've passed from death unto life,
[39:24] not just a state of justification or a
[39:28] state of
[39:30] sanctification or even a state of the
[39:33] work of the Holy Spirit in your life. Do
[39:36] you know that you could come to one of
[39:38] those stages in your life and fail to
[39:41] progress past that stage? Yes. Amen.
[39:45] Just obeying the Lord here. Just forgive
[39:46] me just for a moment as I as I just uh
[39:50] find this. It it's amazing because each
[39:54] stage let me say this is important
[39:58] but you must progress past each stage.
[40:02] Now I don't want to teach on this today
[40:05] because tonight because it's not really
[40:06] Wednesday would be not good for that.
[40:08] Don't have the robbed of the don't have
[40:10] the time to really lay a proper
[40:11] foundation. So I'm not speaking
[40:13] necessarily or teaching necessarily on
[40:16] justification or sanctification. Uh but
[40:19] we do know that brother Brandham all
[40:21] throughout his ministry never veered
[40:24] from that truth that a true birth is con
[40:28] what constitutes a true birth is water,
[40:32] blood, and spirit. Amen. Amen. And so
[40:36] notice this here that and and we we
[40:38] don't we don't mean when we say stage
[40:40] that that you've got to come through
[40:42] some three-step process to where okay
[40:44] now you're justified and and now wait a
[40:47] little week or two then you'll be
[40:48] sanctified and then wait a week or two
[40:50] and then you'll be filled with the
[40:51] spirit. Now that may be the case for
[40:54] some people and brother Brandham would
[40:56] say some people never get past
[40:59] justification. Some people never get
[41:02] past sanctification.
[41:04] And then some people receive a work or a
[41:08] gift of the Holy Ghost in their life and
[41:11] they never move beyond that outer
[41:15] element of that triune being. And
[41:18] because of that, that person constantly
[41:21] lives needing another emotional
[41:24] experience or another feeling that they
[41:26] have on their flesh. I'm not against
[41:28] feeling. I've said it before and I'll
[41:30] say it again. If you don't if you don't
[41:31] want to feel God and you say, "I don't
[41:33] like to feel God." That just proves to
[41:35] me you've never felt him. Because if
[41:37] you've ever felt him, you would never
[41:39] say that. You'd say, "I I want to feel
[41:40] him more." So, I'm not preaching against
[41:43] feelings, but I am preaching to say you
[41:45] must move beyond feelings. Because let
[41:48] me just say, as a son of God, there are
[41:50] many times I feel God and I rejoice. But
[41:53] there are many times I don't feel him.
[41:56] In fact, I feel like he's a million
[41:58] miles away from me. But I'm so glad to
[42:00] know that my position in Christ is not
[42:04] based on how I feel or how I don't feel
[42:07] or what I feel on my flesh. It's based
[42:09] on one thing. The blood of Christ has
[42:12] atoned for my sin, has baptized me into
[42:14] the body, and I am sealed until the day
[42:17] of my redemption. Satan can't take me
[42:20] out of there. Go. I can't even remove
[42:22] myself from that promise.
[42:25] Nothing, Paul said, shall separate me
[42:27] from the love that's in Christ Jesus.
[42:30] But you've got to move past what you
[42:33] feel right. Amen. As Elijah, I think of
[42:37] my mind as Elijah. and Elisha and he's
[42:39] going through the different stages of
[42:40] the journey and he brings him here's
[42:43] Elijah's leaving the scene and Elisha is
[42:45] going to take the mantle and Elijah
[42:47] brings him to Jericho he brings him to
[42:49] Bethl he brings him to Jordan did you
[42:51] know brother Brandham type those three
[42:53] cities with the baptism of the Holy
[42:56] Ghost justification sanctification and
[42:59] then the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:01] crossing Jordan and then a double
[43:04] portion of Elijah's spirit which is the
[43:07] token
[43:08] which is the Holy Ghost, which is the
[43:11] power of God that fell on the day of
[43:13] Pentecost. I'm not talking about 1906
[43:16] and Isuza Street revival. I'm talking
[43:18] about the one revival, the one gospel
[43:21] that changes a man. One time forever,
[43:25] once and for all. Not a need to ever be
[43:28] filled uh to ever be sealed again, but
[43:31] one time you're sealed until the day of
[43:33] your redemption. Say, "Brother Matt, uh,
[43:35] is that what we believe that we have
[43:37] today?" My brother, my sister, I want to
[43:39] tell you today, the same life that Peter
[43:42] preached about in the book of Acts is
[43:44] the same life that's available to every
[43:47] believer, every Christian, all that it
[43:50] takes is a repentant heart. And God can
[43:53] fill that vessel.
[43:56] Do you realize this is what we have in
[43:58] this age? Because when the blood was
[44:00] shed at Calvary, Brother Brandham says
[44:03] it this way. He says in one moment, in
[44:06] one
[44:07] moment, hundreds of years of sacrificing
[44:11] lambs, hundreds of years of looking unto
[44:14] the lamb, hundreds of years of
[44:16] prefiguring the lamb, hundreds of years
[44:18] of shadowing the lamb. In one moment,
[44:22] all of those offerings ceased. Amen. And
[44:25] they were null and void because now the
[44:28] lamb was hanging on a cross, atoning
[44:31] once and for all. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[44:35] now the atonement was no longer the
[44:37] blood of bulls and goats, but the
[44:40] atonement that atonement, I know you've
[44:43] heard this before, that atonement when
[44:44] you break up the word means at onement.
[44:48] It means to bring man and Christ back in
[44:51] harmony, back in fellowship again. Not
[44:55] through a blood, not through a an animal
[44:57] sacrifice, not even through a high
[44:59] priest, not even not through a preacher,
[45:01] not through a prophet, not through a
[45:03] king. God served under those
[45:06] dispensations. But now there was coming
[45:08] the prophet, priest and king who was
[45:10] going to make one sacrifice, making the
[45:13] way available. I just heard brother man
[45:15] say it today. He says, "Notice when the
[45:17] veil of the temple was torn, it wasn't
[45:19] torn from the bottom to the top. It was
[45:21] torn from the top to the bottom showing
[45:24] brother Ben says because why? That that
[45:26] temple veil was 14 ft high." In other
[45:29] words, when that veil of that temple was
[45:31] rent, it was proving no man has done
[45:34] this. There's no man that can do this.
[45:37] It was the one man, the man Christ
[45:39] Jesus. Yes. Amen. And he says, "Now the
[45:43] way is gaping wide open." Amen. And now
[45:48] what was death to not enter is now
[45:50] death. Now what was death to enter is
[45:52] now death if you don't enter. Yes. Amen.
[45:56] This is so powerful because now that
[45:59] token life was no longer the chemistry
[46:02] of an animal,
[46:04] but out of that blood that was shed,
[46:09] there came a life. Not a law, but a life
[46:13] back on the worshipper. Amen.
[46:16] And now that life in the upper room
[46:19] comes in the form of the Holy Ghost and
[46:22] it enters on the day of Pentecost and it
[46:25] comes in the form the Bible says they
[46:27] were all in one place. They were all in
[46:30] one mind in one accord and tongues of
[46:33] cloven
[46:34] fire. that. Listen friends, this this
[46:38] what you were seeing was prophecy being
[46:41] fulfilled that David and Isaiah and
[46:44] Ezekiel and every sage and prophet had
[46:48] waited for the fulfillment of this one
[46:51] day when that law that was written on on
[46:54] tables of stone would now be written on
[46:56] the heart of men. And it would not be
[47:00] just some kind of dress code or some
[47:02] kind of willpower or determination, but
[47:05] it would be God changing your nature and
[47:08] taking the nature of your lamb and
[47:11] replacing your nature and giving you the
[47:13] nature of Christ. Amen. And that would
[47:17] be an atonement of sin. Yes. This is why
[47:22] the life that was in the word was
[47:24] bringing them. I I want you to catch
[47:26] this is so powerful here. The life that
[47:29] was in Christ now leaves Christ and goes
[47:32] into his church. Brother Random said,
[47:34] "All that was in God, he poured into
[47:36] Christ." But all that was in Christ, he
[47:38] poured into his church. You say, "How
[47:41] did they come under the atonement in the
[47:43] days of Moses? They had to have a
[47:45] literal lamb, a literal blood, and take
[47:48] a literal brush and apply it to the
[47:51] lentil and the doorpost of their home."
[47:54] But God was going to change that system.
[47:56] And now the life of the lamb, as brother
[47:59] Adam, the scripture says, the life the
[48:02] worshipper once purged has no
[48:04] consciousness of sin. For if the blood
[48:07] of bulls and goats would have perfected
[48:09] the worshipper, Paul says they would
[48:11] have continually been being offered.
[48:15] Amen. But what the law could not do,
[48:19] Christ could do. What the law was short
[48:22] in what the law, what couldn't the law
[48:24] do, brother Matt? A man could come to
[48:26] God, desire for God, want God's nature,
[48:29] but the life of that lamb could never
[48:31] come back on him. Oh, but I'm so glad
[48:33] tonight that I don't serve a God of
[48:35] yesterday, but that the true lamb of God
[48:38] and all of his benefits and all of his
[48:40] blessing and all of his nature can come
[48:43] back on my life.
[48:46] It could take a rotten, vile sinner
[48:48] worth nothing that can make him a son of
[48:51] God. Amen. And so now notice the life
[48:54] that was in that word was now bringing
[48:58] them under an atonement of
[49:02] sin. That's why when Peter goes to the
[49:06] house of Cornelius and the Bible says
[49:09] that while he yet come on somebody help
[49:13] me finish it spoke. Right.
[49:17] So, you mean it wasn't it wasn't the
[49:20] blood of a lamb, a literal lamb? It
[49:23] wasn't even the blood of Christ on a
[49:27] cross because, brother said, if I had a
[49:30] a charger, he says, or a vial of the
[49:33] blood of Christ, he said, it wouldn't do
[49:35] you any good, the literal chemistry of
[49:38] the blood. But now, the word.
[49:41] Hallelujah. Because Christ is his word.
[49:45] Come on, somebody help me preach here
[49:47] tonight. He's not a dead letter. He's
[49:49] not a doctrine. He's not a theory. He's
[49:51] not a teaching. He You can teach on him.
[49:54] You can have theories about him. You can
[49:56] make doctrines about him and still not
[49:59] have him. Amen.
[50:02] But he is his word. That's why brother
[50:04] man says to reject his word is to reject
[50:07] him. Amen. And so now the life that was
[50:11] in Christ is in his word. And the Bible
[50:14] says while Peter yet spoke the word.
[50:18] And he says while he yet spoke the word,
[50:20] the Holy Ghost fell upon them.
[50:24] And so what was changing? It was the
[50:26] dispensation no longer of the blood of a
[50:29] lamb, but by the passing of the word of
[50:32] God, by the preaching of the word of
[50:34] God, by the power of the cross, coming
[50:37] off of the Bible, out of history, coming
[50:40] through the mouth of a preacher, and
[50:42] they were filled with the Holy Ghost.
[50:45] Amen. Why do you think Satan hates
[50:48] preaching? Oh, yeah. Amen.
[50:51] I'm talking about true preaching.
[50:53] because he knows that by the preaching
[50:55] of the word, it brings atonement to
[50:57] people's lives. And it fills with the
[50:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Your faith
[51:02] mixed with the word brings forth the
[51:05] atonement. Amen.
[51:08] Listen to what brother Brandham says
[51:09] here in Fellowship by redemption. Before
[51:11] you can enter into this
[51:13] place, there's a blood veil hanging
[51:16] there for a cleansing.
[51:19] And you must recognize that blood as an
[51:22] innocent substitute through the
[51:25] preaching of the word brought down the
[51:29] veil of blood. Amen. So when Peter went
[51:33] to the house of Cornelius, the Bible
[51:35] says while he yet spoke those words, so
[51:38] the life of God that was in Christ was
[51:41] now coming to the church through the
[51:44] power of a spoken word. Yes. Amen.
[51:47] That's why the spoken word is the
[51:49] original seed. Can you say amen? And so
[51:53] that word not a dry dead intellectual
[51:56] word. Not even as you study it at home
[51:58] and you study it and that's wonderful.
[52:01] But listen friends, until this becomes
[52:03] real and a revelation inside of your
[52:05] heart. It's no different than algebra.
[52:07] It's no different some people. It is
[52:09] algebra to some people as as they read
[52:11] it. It's no different than just good.
[52:13] Listen friends, it's no good than just
[52:15] the the the Hindus or the Buddhas or or
[52:18] or a Muslim. Yeah. Amen. Do you realize
[52:23] that if the person if you don't receive
[52:26] him, not just his teaching, but you've
[52:30] got to receive him. Yes. Amen. The Bible
[52:34] says the letter kleth, but the spirit
[52:36] giveth life. Amen. And so the preaching
[52:40] of the true word is what Paul said, "I'm
[52:43] not ashamed
[52:44] of because it's the power of God unto
[52:49] salvation." Amen. Hello. Amen. And so
[52:54] that that that word that was delivered
[52:56] on the day of Pentecost was was more
[52:58] than just a uh Peter was was more than
[53:01] just a man speaking, you know, uh coming
[53:03] under some kind of emotional anointing,
[53:06] but it was literally the fulfillment of
[53:08] prophecy. It was the fulfillment of
[53:10] promise.
[53:12] And now that you say, "Brother Matt,
[53:14] you're preaching on revival." That's
[53:15] right. I'm preaching on what started
[53:17] this revival. And I'm here to preach to
[53:19] you tonight that that's what we need to
[53:21] be revived back to. You say, "Brother
[53:24] Matt, what is a revival? Something new?"
[53:26] No, brother. It's taking what we've
[53:28] already got and God charging it with his
[53:31] life and it becoming so real to us that
[53:34] the same power that filled them in the
[53:36] upper room can fill us here at Bethl
[53:38] Tabernacle tonight. It could fill every
[53:40] young person. It could fill every old
[53:42] person. It could take the dry and the
[53:45] lukewarm and and set a fire underneath
[53:48] him. Amen. So your faith in that word,
[53:52] what what do you mean when you say
[53:53] faith? I mean revelation. Your faith in
[53:56] that word, believing that word brings
[54:00] the promise to you. Amen. Out of the
[54:03] Bible and to your life. Hallelujah.
[54:05] Well, that's good, brother Matt. Well,
[54:07] let me just make you a little bit. If
[54:08] that don't make you happy, let me make
[54:09] you happy. Come on. Healing of your body
[54:12] is in that promise. Amen. Salvation to
[54:16] your family is in that promise.
[54:19] Lost loved ones coming back and prodals
[54:22] coming back is in that promise. And so
[54:26] now, what does that promise mean to you?
[54:28] Now, what does faith in that promised
[54:30] word mean to us as a church? Amen.
[54:35] All of the all of the promises of God is
[54:38] in the word and could be are are not
[54:41] just a word but there are living reality
[54:44] waiting to make themselves manifest to
[54:46] us. Salvation is there. You need
[54:48] restoration it's there. Amen. Amen.
[54:56] So, Brother Bam says this here, and I
[54:58] just want to make sure I don't get too
[55:01] far ahead of myself on on something and
[55:03] and not be able to get to my real heart
[55:05] here tonight. You love him? Amen.
[55:09] And so, notice this here. There
[55:13] there's as we're preaching on revival.
[55:16] Thank you. Listen to what Brother
[55:18] Brandham says here. I thought this was
[55:19] so good. And I don't have this here
[55:21] before you, so just listen as best that
[55:23] that you can. Brother Bam says in the
[55:26] angel of the Lord and he says, "And as
[55:29] atheism is on the march and so forth and
[55:33] the churches are falling away and
[55:36] getting formal," let me say this to you,
[55:39] my dear brother and sister, if you'll
[55:41] receive me as your brother, we need a
[55:44] revival.
[55:46] I'm not discrediting anything.
[55:49] I'm talking from my heart. Amen. We're
[55:52] having a lot of protractive meetings,
[55:56] but not true revival.
[55:58] We have great men. For instance, Billy
[56:00] Graham, a wonderful man, Charles Fuller,
[56:03] Dr. Dhan, and many of the others that I
[56:06] couldn't call, Hyman Appleman, and many
[56:08] great men. We're having great there's
[56:11] also brother Roberts, brother Adams
[56:12] laying all these brothers. We're having
[56:14] these great brothers. Brother Freeman,
[56:16] uh, at my own meetings, he puts himself
[56:19] right
[56:19] there and he says, "We're having great
[56:23] protractive meetings, great
[56:26] stimulations." And brother Brandham
[56:28] says, "Listen, we're having great
[56:31] crowds." You say, "What is what else are
[56:34] you looking for, Brother Brandham? We're
[56:37] having great
[56:38] crowds, but no revival.
[56:43] We're getting people to come up. maybe
[56:45] and stagger
[56:47] along and confess and go back. But what
[56:52] we need is an
[56:54] oldfashioned breaking up. I love that. A
[56:58] tearing down. How many think of revival?
[57:01] When you think of revival, you don't
[57:02] think of breaking up and tearing down.
[57:05] You think of shouting and happy and
[57:07] joyful and dancing and gleeful. And I
[57:11] believe it's all of that's part of a
[57:12] true revival. But do we know that true
[57:15] revival, the true spirit of revival that
[57:18] started on the day of Pentecost, the
[57:21] Bible says that Peter started it by
[57:23] saying these words, repent. Yeah. Amen.
[57:28] Amen.
[57:31] Repent. And no true revival can ever
[57:35] come until we start with repent. Amen.
[57:41] And no man can do that for you. No, no,
[57:47] no preacher can do that for you. You
[57:50] can't do it for me. I can't do it for
[57:52] you. What it takes is the Holy Ghost to
[57:56] come and and and so expose ourself to
[58:01] ourself.
[58:03] Amen. Listen friends, you can beat
[58:06] somebody on the back. And brother Adam
[58:08] was against that. You know, he said,
[58:09] "I'm not I'm not talking about, you
[58:11] know, we we talk about repentance." He
[58:13] said, you know, so many times we get
[58:14] people and beat them on the back and
[58:16] say, "Come on, Johnny. You know, you
[58:18] ain't living right and you got a mother
[58:20] and crying and that's all wonderful and
[58:22] a grandmother crying. You better get
[58:24] right, brother says, but real repentance
[58:27] that might reform the man, but you don't
[58:30] need something to reform. You need
[58:31] something to transform." Yes.
[58:35] And a true repentance doesn't start from
[58:38] somebody making you feel bad, even a
[58:40] preacher making you feel bad or even
[58:42] preaching hellfire and brimstone to
[58:45] where you're so scared for your life.
[58:48] Listen friends, that's not true
[58:49] repentance.
[58:51] But true repentance is when we ourself
[58:54] take inventory of our own life. Not even
[58:58] oursel. But the Bible says that he that
[59:00] knoweth the heart, knoweth the mind,
[59:03] searcheth the heart, tryth the reigns of
[59:07] the spirit. Oh, I'm talking about a true
[59:10] uh uh Holy Ghost magnifying glass to
[59:13] come so close to our hearts to to to
[59:16] come with the light of his word. Oh, how
[59:18] many want they hear tonight to say, God,
[59:21] let your word so shine in every cavern
[59:24] and every part of my being, oh God. And
[59:27] if I need to be convicted, convict me,
[59:29] Holy Ghost.
[59:32] But don't leave me like I am.
[59:35] Brother Bam says, "Oh," he says, "What
[59:37] we need," I love
[59:39] this. And he says, "What we need is a
[59:43] great breaking up, a tearing down, a
[59:47] rooting out
[59:49] revival that starts in every home."
[59:54] Amen.
[59:56] and sweeps through the city and they
[59:58] close all the bootleg joints and
[1:00:00] everything and straighten the thing up.
[1:00:02] That's a revival.
[1:00:06] See, not just walking up and making a
[1:00:09] confession and going back and it's no
[1:00:12] revival. That's just form. It's a
[1:00:14] lukewarm condition. We need a revival.
[1:00:19] Preaching to you on the spirit of
[1:00:20] revival. And God help us. I'd say yes
[1:00:24] Lord to have it. Amen. He says in
[1:00:28] another place in Israel in the church he
[1:00:30] says here they go moving down. One of
[1:00:32] the writers said that God was in that
[1:00:33] pillar of fire and he looked down
[1:00:35] through with angry eyes and said what?
[1:00:38] And he said when he did the Red Sea got
[1:00:40] scared and be to move back and Israel
[1:00:43] passed on through dry land. Never even
[1:00:46] got their feet muddy. Well these guys
[1:00:49] come along said we're just as much
[1:00:51] human. Brother Brandham says, "Oh, we're
[1:00:53] just as much human as they are, and we
[1:00:55] worship the same as they do, so we'll do
[1:00:57] it." And when they got out there, they
[1:00:59] found out they couldn't make it. Amen.
[1:01:02] I want you to listen. Brother's talking
[1:01:05] about the Cheddar of Israel as they go
[1:01:07] over. Brother Brandham says, "Notice
[1:01:09] they crossed." He said, "Other said,
[1:01:10] "Oh, we're no different. We'll just go
[1:01:12] on over." And brother says, "They found
[1:01:13] out they couldn't." And that's what's
[1:01:16] going to happen one of these days,
[1:01:18] brother, when the separating time comes.
[1:01:21] And do you lukewarm church member that's
[1:01:24] trying you're trying to impersonate
[1:01:27] Christianity? One of these days you're
[1:01:29] going to try to follow that Holy Ghost
[1:01:32] band and you'll find out your wheels
[1:01:34] will come off yonder in the muddy
[1:01:36] somewhere.
[1:01:39] There was 10 virgins went to meet the
[1:01:42] Lord. Five of them were wise and five
[1:01:45] were
[1:01:46] foolish. Put oil in your lamp, trimmer
[1:01:49] bright. One of these days they're going
[1:01:52] up. Amen. The Bible says there was
[1:01:54] weeping and welling and
[1:01:57] nashing. Nashing of teeth. I believe
[1:01:59] it's a reality, friends. One day there
[1:02:03] will be weeping and welling and nashing.
[1:02:06] But I got good news. That's not today.
[1:02:09] Amen. Because today there's mercy.
[1:02:13] Today there's hope.
[1:02:16] Is there hope for me to have a revival?
[1:02:18] Brother Matt, today there's mercy. Today
[1:02:20] there's hope. Today God can stir your
[1:02:24] heart.
[1:02:25] Brother Adam says we must not let the
[1:02:27] spirit of revival die. Listen what he
[1:02:30] says here. He says the Bible predicts
[1:02:32] that the last church age, the Ladyan
[1:02:35] church age, which is a lukewarm. That's
[1:02:38] just as far as the church has got today.
[1:02:42] They got down to where maybe they can
[1:02:44] clap their hand a little bit and maybe
[1:02:47] make a little noise and jump and kick
[1:02:49] the furniture.
[1:02:51] Boy, we ain't even got that.
[1:02:57] I ain't seen none of y'all kick the
[1:02:59] furniture
[1:03:01] yet. We've got to where we can kick the
[1:03:04] furniture a little while. Listen to
[1:03:05] this. But when it comes to living a
[1:03:10] pure,
[1:03:11] holy,
[1:03:13] unadulterated, sanctified life, Amen.
[1:03:17] They're as far as the night is from the
[1:03:20] day.
[1:03:24] It's amazing because we know that the
[1:03:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I'm
[1:03:29] talking about the true baptism of the
[1:03:31] Holy Ghost, changes everything about
[1:03:34] you. The Bible says, "Whoever is in
[1:03:36] Christ is a new creature, a new
[1:03:40] creation." Somebody help me. All things
[1:03:43] are passed away. Behold, all things
[1:03:48] become new. Is that right? Amen.
[1:03:51] And so, notice this
[1:03:54] here. It's It's amazing. Let let me just
[1:03:56] find my place
[1:03:59] here because it's it's incredible to me
[1:04:02] because we ask the question, I know that
[1:04:05] I'm born of the spirit of God. I know
[1:04:07] I've passed from death unto life. I know
[1:04:10] that I have the adoption robe. I have
[1:04:13] the ring of power, the signate of his
[1:04:17] union of the marriage of the lamb. I
[1:04:19] know that I've been I know that I've I'm
[1:04:22] I'm married unto Christ. I know that
[1:04:24] I've passed from death unto life. I know
[1:04:26] this. Like the woman said, I ain't what
[1:04:29] I used to be and I ain't what I and he
[1:04:33] says, I ain't what I should be, but
[1:04:35] thank God I ain't what I used to be.
[1:04:39] And so we know that something has taken
[1:04:42] place in our life. We know that
[1:04:44] something real has happened in our
[1:04:47] beyond our emotions, beyond our human
[1:04:50] intellect, beyond our own even
[1:04:52] understanding. We know that something
[1:04:55] truly has taken place. But can I just
[1:04:57] ask you here tonight, does that mean
[1:05:00] that we're finished? Come on. Does that
[1:05:04] mean God's done? No. You know, it's so
[1:05:07] amazing because so many people put the
[1:05:08] baptism I'm talking about the true seal
[1:05:10] of the Holy Ghost as the finish line.
[1:05:12] When actually it's not the finish line
[1:05:14] at all.
[1:05:16] Say, "Oh, you better cl you better back
[1:05:18] that up." Well, I ain't got a new body.
[1:05:19] I don't know about you, but I don't have
[1:05:21] a new body. This better not be the
[1:05:23] finish line. I'm glad I got the the I'm
[1:05:25] glad I got the Holy Ghost. But can I
[1:05:27] tell you what my Bible says? That the
[1:05:29] Bible calls that the earnest. That means
[1:05:31] it's just the down payment. That's
[1:05:33] right. But one day I'll get the full
[1:05:36] adoption, the full inheritance. Oh, yes.
[1:05:39] It's proof that I'll get it one day. But
[1:05:41] I'm here to tell you that that that
[1:05:42] that's not the finish line, brother.
[1:05:45] That's just you getting started in
[1:05:47] Christ.
[1:05:49] Amen. So, what is the process? I've been
[1:05:51] pondering these things lately just in my
[1:05:53] own notes, my own personal walk with the
[1:05:58] Lord. What is what is the work? Can I
[1:06:01] say it this way as I wrote it? What is
[1:06:04] the process or the work that God is
[1:06:08] doing in the lives of the born again?
[1:06:12] Amen. Baptized with the Holy Ghost,
[1:06:14] sealed into the day of your redemption.
[1:06:16] And let me just say this, when you are
[1:06:19] truly born of his spirit, not as we said
[1:06:22] as Elijah stops at at at at at at at at
[1:06:26] Jordan, stops at Bethl, stops at
[1:06:28] Jericho. You remember that in your
[1:06:30] Bible? And brother Brandham says he
[1:06:31] couldn't stop there. He had to move on
[1:06:33] past Jordan. I'm sorry, past Beth pasta
[1:06:36] Bethl. He had to move past Jericho. He
[1:06:39] had to move past the school of the
[1:06:40] prophets. Yeah. Because Jordan was
[1:06:43] waiting. Notice throughout all of that,
[1:06:45] he still had not passed from death unto
[1:06:47] life yet. Amen.
[1:06:49] And it but every stage was important,
[1:06:52] but he couldn't stop at any stage. Amen.
[1:06:56] But knowing that we pass from death unto
[1:06:58] life. Knowing that as a born again
[1:07:02] believer, you have the full authority of
[1:07:07] heaven backing up your words.
[1:07:12] I'm not talking about something that's
[1:07:13] waiting off in the misty blue. Sometimes
[1:07:16] we give the devil too much credit and
[1:07:18] allow him in when he has no right in our
[1:07:21] homes, in our body, in our children, in
[1:07:24] our minds. The devil is a squatter if he
[1:07:27] has any place. The Bible says give no
[1:07:30] place to the devil cuz he don't deserve
[1:07:32] one. He should be a homeless, the
[1:07:34] homeless bum that he is, he shouldn't
[1:07:37] have no home in the place of a believer.
[1:07:39] He shouldn't have no home in the place
[1:07:42] of a of any church of the living God.
[1:07:44] Can you say amen? He shouldn't have have
[1:07:46] no place in our mind, in our memory, in
[1:07:49] our
[1:07:51] imaginations. We shouldn't give him any
[1:07:53] thought, any thought that he tries to
[1:07:55] put in your mind. Say, "Satan, I'm not
[1:07:57] allowing you to take place. I'm going to
[1:07:59] take that thought under the the Bible
[1:08:02] says, take every thought captive uh to
[1:08:05] the power of the Holy Ghost. Cast down
[1:08:07] vain imaginations." Amen. Amen.
[1:08:13] But I'm afraid so many times we give him
[1:08:15] place. Just invite him in.
[1:08:19] That's all right. Come in. Come on. Come
[1:08:21] on. You know, you say, "Well, I he
[1:08:22] doesn't have full control." Yeah, but
[1:08:24] you're allowed him to live there in some
[1:08:26] complex.
[1:08:28] Some grudge, right? Amen. Well, all
[1:08:32] right. It's true anyway.
[1:08:34] Amen. Listen friends, the devil should
[1:08:37] have no place in our life. The devil
[1:08:40] should have no place. He should get none
[1:08:43] of our time.
[1:08:46] Not any in our recreation, not any in
[1:08:48] our entertainment, not any in our
[1:08:50] fellowship. Amen. Not any when we gossip
[1:08:54] about other people. That's given the
[1:08:55] devil place. Amen. I'm going to keep
[1:08:59] preaching whether you say amen or not.
[1:09:02] You gossip about the pastor, gossip
[1:09:04] about the preacher, gossip about your
[1:09:05] brother, gossip about your sister. That
[1:09:08] is giving the devil a place. Brother
[1:09:10] Brandham says he only he says what how
[1:09:13] much power does Satan have? As much as
[1:09:15] you give him. That's right. He has to
[1:09:18] have Brother Brandham says a spirit is
[1:09:21] powerless unless it has somebody to work
[1:09:24] or something to work through. Yes. Amen.
[1:09:29] Amen.
[1:09:31] And so we give him place when he has no
[1:09:34] place. We we we we don't exercise our
[1:09:38] God-given authority over him.
[1:09:40] Hallelujah. Amen. But can I just say if
[1:09:43] you're born of the spirit of God, a
[1:09:45] spirit, brother Brandham says, he says
[1:09:47] when a spirit born, spiritfilled man in
[1:09:51] faith takes the word in his heart and
[1:09:55] places it on his lips, it's the same as
[1:09:58] deity speaking.
[1:10:01] And every mountain, does somebody
[1:10:03] believe this here tonight? Every
[1:10:05] mountain has to go and Satan cannot
[1:10:09] stand before that man. Amen.
[1:10:13] Amen. So I believe the full power of the
[1:10:16] token life is made available to the
[1:10:19] believer. But I also know I would have
[1:10:23] to deny scripture and I would have to
[1:10:26] deny what brother Brandham taught. I
[1:10:28] would even have to deny my own personal
[1:10:30] experience to say that when I'm born
[1:10:33] again by the spirit of God, the work is
[1:10:35] completely completed and there's nothing
[1:10:38] else that the Holy Ghost needs to do to
[1:10:39] me. Come on. That would be to deny my
[1:10:44] own experience with the Lord. Amen. You
[1:10:48] say, "Brother Matt, what are you
[1:10:49] saying?" I'm saying it, well, let me
[1:10:50] make it simple. He's still working on me
[1:10:54] to make me what I ought to be.
[1:10:57] Took him just a week. I don't know the
[1:10:58] rest of the words. It's been a little
[1:11:00] kid since I sang that, but he's still
[1:11:02] working on me.
[1:11:04] There's got to be
[1:11:07] a growth, a maturity
[1:11:10] that happens. No, it doesn't mean you
[1:11:12] get more power when you're mature
[1:11:13] enough. It doesn't mean that God goes,
[1:11:15] "All right, now I'm going to give you my
[1:11:17] No, friends, when you have the Holy
[1:11:19] Ghost, you have all heaven backing you
[1:11:21] up." That's right. What more do you need
[1:11:23] other than the man, Brother Adam, I'm
[1:11:25] saying, the word on your lips is the
[1:11:26] same as deity.
[1:11:28] Amen.
[1:11:30] But there's got to be that that
[1:11:32] collectively, let me say this,
[1:11:35] collectively this is happening right now
[1:11:40] through trials, tribulations, tests,
[1:11:45] storms. And we pray, God, I want to be
[1:11:47] more like you, Lord. I want that token
[1:11:49] life. I want to be more like Jesus. And
[1:11:52] brother Brandham says, we ask for more
[1:11:54] of God. And I'm going to give you his
[1:11:56] words. And he says, "So God gives us the
[1:11:58] best he could give us, trials and
[1:12:02] tribulations."
[1:12:04] That's right.
[1:12:07] And you say, "Brother Matt, what do you
[1:12:08] believe they're sent for? For what I'm
[1:12:10] preaching on here tonight?" Yes. To take
[1:12:12] you not through just one revival, but to
[1:12:15] keep the spirit of revival alive.
[1:12:19] Amen. This isn't a oneoff. This isn't
[1:12:22] one time God did something for you,
[1:12:24] friend. It's got to be a daily revival,
[1:12:27] a daily dying. Let me give you the words
[1:12:30] of Brother Brandham. It's got to be the
[1:12:32] revival in me, the revival in you, not
[1:12:36] the revival in a church, not the revival
[1:12:38] of a of the bride. That's wonderful, but
[1:12:40] what about me? Amen. Amen. We must, as
[1:12:45] brother says, we must not let the spirit
[1:12:48] of revival die.
[1:12:51] Amen.
[1:12:54] And so collectively, this is what's
[1:12:57] happening right now to the true church.
[1:13:01] The prophet would use these words. Oh,
[1:13:03] and I don't have them here, but you
[1:13:04] could just you you could search this and
[1:13:06] it's over and over and over and over and
[1:13:08] over in the message. And he would say
[1:13:10] it, I'll just give you the most direct
[1:13:12] language he uses. He says, "And as the
[1:13:16] headstone, remember brother Brandham's
[1:13:18] word to the church." Is that the
[1:13:20] Pergamian church age? I may be getting
[1:13:23] that wrong. Ser, not the Simian. Maybe
[1:13:25] it's the Thai tyrant. And brother Adam
[1:13:27] says, I want to, he says, I he says, the
[1:13:29] Lord gave me a message. I took up my
[1:13:31] pen, told me to take up my pen. You
[1:13:32] remember that? Pick up your pen and
[1:13:34] write. And he says, and brother Adam
[1:13:36] picks up a piece of paper and he starts
[1:13:38] to read it. Here's what I'm trying to
[1:13:40] say to you. The law of reproduction.
[1:13:42] Every seed shall be shall bring forth
[1:13:45] after its own kind. And brother Brandham
[1:13:46] then goes on and he says, "And Christ
[1:13:48] will get so real in that last day true
[1:13:51] church that they will be a super church,
[1:13:54] a super race, a super people."
[1:13:58] She will be the final voice to, he says
[1:14:00] in another place, the final voice to the
[1:14:02] final age. And let me give you his
[1:14:04] language. As the headstone nears the
[1:14:07] body,
[1:14:09] those in the bride will be so much like
[1:14:13] Christ. Amen.
[1:14:16] till they are in his very
[1:14:22] power miracles. Yeah, I believe that.
[1:14:26] Amen.
[1:14:27] Brother Brandham even says in another
[1:14:29] place that you as the bride body of
[1:14:31] Christ are to perform the same works
[1:14:34] that Jesus did. Amen.
[1:14:37] Hello.
[1:14:41] You are to perform the same works that
[1:14:44] Jesus did. What is brother Bam says?
[1:14:46] What is God waiting on? The the only
[1:14:48] thing the rapture is waiting on is the
[1:14:51] readiness of his church. Amen.
[1:14:55] To have his power, to have his miracles.
[1:14:59] Yes, I believe that. But also his divine
[1:15:02] nature. As Peter says, add unto add
[1:15:06] these precious promises that are given
[1:15:08] to us. uh add to your faith, add to your
[1:15:12] knowledge, knowledge, virtue,
[1:15:13] temperance, meekness, brotherly
[1:15:15] kindness, godliness. Amen.
[1:15:18] So those in the true church will be so
[1:15:21] much like Christ till they are in his
[1:15:24] very image. Amen. That means that Amen,
[1:15:29] sister. That's right. That means that
[1:15:31] they have his power. They have his life.
[1:15:33] They have his nature. They have his
[1:15:34] love. They have his gifts. They have his
[1:15:36] fruits. They have his word because he is
[1:15:40] his word. They have even his
[1:15:45] faith. Not faith in the son of God, but
[1:15:48] the faith of the son of God. Amen. Can
[1:15:52] you say amen?
[1:15:55] And so what's happening right now
[1:15:57] collectively that true church born again
[1:16:02] filled with the spirit of God.
[1:16:04] But all the while there's a need to be
[1:16:08] honed down. Amen. And shaved down. Yes.
[1:16:13] Amen. As brother Adam says, that's
[1:16:14] what's happening. And he talks about
[1:16:16] that pyramid. He said you couldn't even
[1:16:17] get a a piece of paper. And he said it
[1:16:20] was just just to in that in that
[1:16:22] pyramid, he said to take a piece of
[1:16:24] paper to slide it through. He says
[1:16:26] because it was just cut to a razor's
[1:16:29] edge. Amen.
[1:16:32] And he says as the
[1:16:34] headstone nears the body, I can give you
[1:16:37] this quote and brother Adam says the
[1:16:40] dynamics uh you you believe we've got
[1:16:43] the mechanics. How many believe we got
[1:16:44] the mechanics? How many believe we've
[1:16:47] got the mechanics? Listen friends, we
[1:16:49] don't need another messenger to come. We
[1:16:51] don't need another message. We've got
[1:16:53] the message of the hour. Amen.
[1:16:56] What we need is the dynamics of
[1:16:59] Pentecost to come upon what we've
[1:17:01] already got. Not something new, but a
[1:17:04] revival of what God already sent. Can I
[1:17:07] just say this, brother? You might be
[1:17:09] looking for something down the road, but
[1:17:11] if what God has already sent doesn't
[1:17:14] move you, nothing coming will. There is
[1:17:17] no preacher coming. There is no prophet
[1:17:20] coming. There is no miracle going to
[1:17:22] take place. If the message that God sent
[1:17:25] doesn't stir you, then don't think
[1:17:27] anything coming will. But I'm so glad my
[1:17:30] heart can be stirred. I'm so glad I can
[1:17:33] be energized by the word of God. I
[1:17:36] believe it with all of my heart. And I
[1:17:38] say, God, I may not line up to it. I may
[1:17:40] not match it all the time, but I want
[1:17:43] to, Lord. I want to come into your
[1:17:45] image. Hone me down, Lord. Shave me down
[1:17:50] till there's nothing, not nothing, all
[1:17:52] the way down to a razor's edge.
[1:17:55] Brother Brandham says this shaving. And
[1:17:58] he says right now, and he says the
[1:18:00] dynamics of this church will be a
[1:18:03] refilling.
[1:18:06] Amen. Sounds like a revival to me.
[1:18:10] The dynamics of this church. How many
[1:18:13] believe you're part of that true church?
[1:18:15] Amen.
[1:18:18] Will be a refilling
[1:18:20] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yes.
[1:18:23] Amen. Which we have worked, he says, in
[1:18:26] a small measure.
[1:18:29] Amen.
[1:18:30] Hold up. Yeah. Blind eyes see. Yeah.
[1:18:35] Deaf ears heard. Yeah.
[1:18:39] Perry Green says as he's watching that
[1:18:41] little boy and he says is is his his is
[1:18:44] I think it was yeah it was blindness and
[1:18:46] he said he he watched him or or maybe it
[1:18:48] was his feet. Yes. He brother Brandham
[1:18:50] says brother Perry says I watched two
[1:18:52] feet come down and grow on that little
[1:18:54] boy. He jumped out of brother Brandham's
[1:18:55] arms and ran. Brother Perry said I was a
[1:18:58] critic until that moment and I watched
[1:19:00] that little boy jump into his dad's
[1:19:02] arms. Amen.
[1:19:05] Blind eyes seen, deaf ears were opened,
[1:19:08] even brother way different ones raised
[1:19:11] from the dead. Amen.
[1:19:15] And here's what brother Brandham
[1:19:17] says. That we have worked in a small
[1:19:24] measure. Let me go and read the rest of
[1:19:26] the quote. But as the
[1:19:30] headstone, what is the headstone,
[1:19:32] brother Matt? I'm going to tell you what
[1:19:33] it was. It's Christ in the person of his
[1:19:36] word.
[1:19:38] That's why people only seen a prophet.
[1:19:40] And some people worship a prophet. But I
[1:19:42] seen more than a prophet. Jesus said,
[1:19:45] "What came yacht to see a prophet? Yay,
[1:19:47] I say to you, more than a prophet." He
[1:19:49] was the fulfillment of word of
[1:19:51] scripture, even the book he's written in
[1:19:53] the book of Malachi. Did you know
[1:19:55] Malachi, the Jewish scholars believe
[1:19:58] that wasn't even his name? Malachi,
[1:20:00] there was no prophet named Malachi. That
[1:20:02] actually is a Hebrew word which means I
[1:20:04] looked it up today. Messenger.
[1:20:08] The book of Malachi is the book of the
[1:20:11] message. The messenger and his message.
[1:20:15] And let me say what a prophet said. As
[1:20:17] the headstone nears the body. That means
[1:20:20] that when brother Brandham left the
[1:20:22] seals were open, the trumpets were
[1:20:24] explained all the mysteries were
[1:20:26] revealed. But the headstone was still
[1:20:29] coming down to the body. That's why you
[1:20:32] feel the pressure of this age. That's
[1:20:34] why the devil fights you the way that he
[1:20:36] does. That's why God is here to
[1:20:39] encourage you and charge your faith
[1:20:41] because the headstone is nearing the
[1:20:44] body. Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham says,
[1:20:48] "And as that headstone nears the body,
[1:20:50] the full power of the Holy Ghost will be
[1:20:54] given unto her. Amen. And even the dead,
[1:20:57] brother Brandham says, that had been
[1:20:58] dead for hundreds of years will come
[1:21:01] back out of the grave. Amen. You believe
[1:21:04] that?
[1:21:08] So that headstone as it nears the body,
[1:21:12] I love that. You know why I love that so
[1:21:14] much? Because it shows me I haven't
[1:21:17] missed it. Right. Amen. Sometimes I look
[1:21:20] and I say, "Man, I don't measure up and
[1:21:23] I I I'm a million miles away and come
[1:21:25] on, get with the program. Look at you.
[1:21:28] What what you you're so lagging so far
[1:21:30] behind, but I got good news here today.
[1:21:32] The race ain't over. I still got a
[1:21:34] chance. I still got hope. I still can
[1:21:37] have a revival as the headstone nears
[1:21:40] the body." Meaning that there's a
[1:21:43] process That's right. Amen. taking
[1:21:46] place. Amen.
[1:21:51] As the headstone nears the body, he
[1:21:54] says, "It's going to take a lot of
[1:21:56] shaving down." Amen. Shaving down of me.
[1:22:02] He even includes himself. And if a
[1:22:04] prophet could, I'll include myself. Say,
[1:22:06] "Lord, there's going to take a lot of
[1:22:08] shaving
[1:22:09] down. It's going to take a lot of honing
[1:22:12] down.
[1:22:14] She's now adopted sons of daughters of
[1:22:16] God, seated together in heavenly places
[1:22:19] with Christ Jesus already. She's already
[1:22:22] seated with
[1:22:24] him. But at the same time, our
[1:22:28] bodies are not changed. Right. And can I
[1:22:33] dare say that there's even things in our
[1:22:36] own humanity
[1:22:38] that don't always match
[1:22:41] what the Bible says the true church
[1:22:43] should look like. Amen. Does that mean
[1:22:45] that you're just out? Well, if you are,
[1:22:48] I am, too. And if I am, Brother Brandham
[1:22:52] was out, too. Come on.
[1:22:56] But it takes a shaving. It takes a
[1:22:59] honing. It takes things out of our
[1:23:02] fallen nature that we are subduing and
[1:23:06] bringing under full control. I'm not
[1:23:08] talking about habits. Listen friends, if
[1:23:10] you've got habits in your life, you're
[1:23:12] still listening to the worldly music. I
[1:23:14] doubt you've even been sanctified, let
[1:23:16] alone born again of the spirit of God.
[1:23:19] The nature of Christ in you would not
[1:23:21] long for those things in your heart. I
[1:23:24] don't say that to condemn you. I say it
[1:23:26] to warn you and challenge you. If you
[1:23:28] still see the world and the thirst and
[1:23:30] appetite for the things of the world,
[1:23:33] the the spirit of God is not in you. I'm
[1:23:36] giving you the I'm giving you the words
[1:23:38] of Jesus. He that loveth this world, the
[1:23:42] love of God is not in him. Amen. I'm not
[1:23:45] talking about you trip up and you mess
[1:23:47] up and you make mistakes. I'm talking
[1:23:49] about habits in your life. If we've
[1:23:51] still got things in our life that are
[1:23:54] sinful habits, habitual lifestyles of
[1:23:57] sin. Amen.
[1:24:00] I'm not talking about those
[1:24:02] things. I'm talking about things that
[1:24:04] are in our carnal sticky nature that
[1:24:06] Brother Adam says that we will deal
[1:24:09] with as long as we're alive. That's
[1:24:12] right. Amen.
[1:24:18] I know. I know that we could name them,
[1:24:20] but but I I I I'll just I'll just make
[1:24:22] them as simple for you as I can. I I'm
[1:24:25] talking about things like our patience,
[1:24:30] cuz that's a trait of godliness.
[1:24:33] Amen. I'm talking about our temper.
[1:24:36] You can name whatever you want to put
[1:24:38] there. That's right. Amen.
[1:24:40] Talking about our confession. Amen.
[1:24:44] Negativity. Yeah.
[1:24:47] controlling our tongue. James says,
[1:24:48] "Don't you know that he that hath
[1:24:50] control over the tongue the same as a
[1:24:52] perfect man." Amen. Tieios meaning full
[1:24:55] age.
[1:24:57] And some of us sometimes struggle to
[1:24:59] even control our own tongue. Yeah. Amen.
[1:25:03] And yet the saints of God, know you not,
[1:25:07] will judge the earth. Amen. Even judge
[1:25:11] angels.
[1:25:15] You see, when you start preaching like
[1:25:17] this, you bring it down to a razor's
[1:25:19] edge. But I want to tell you, friends,
[1:25:21] that's what God's trying to get us to.
[1:25:24] Amen.
[1:25:27] Full control, our thought
[1:25:30] life. You say, "Brother Matt, what are
[1:25:32] you preaching on?" I'm preaching on my
[1:25:34] character, matching his character. Yes.
[1:25:37] Amen. This is what it means to overcome.
[1:25:42] This is what I take from brother
[1:25:43] Random's many statements. He would say
[1:25:45] until the Holy Spirit blends into the
[1:25:48] church and the church blends into
[1:25:51] Christ. And he says in another place,
[1:25:53] these last days, the true bride church
[1:25:56] comes to the headstone will be the super
[1:25:59] church, a super race. As she nears the
[1:26:02] great headstone, they will be so much
[1:26:05] like him. They will be in his very
[1:26:08] image. This is in order to be united
[1:26:13] with him. They will. This is the words
[1:26:17] of a prophet. They, who's they? You.
[1:26:20] Somebody say me. Me and Christ. Say
[1:26:23] Christ will be one. John 17. The prayer
[1:26:27] of Jesus will be answered in the body of
[1:26:31] the living bride of Christ. When he
[1:26:33] says, "Father, that that that they may
[1:26:35] be one even as I." That was the prayer
[1:26:38] of Jesus that the same unity he had with
[1:26:41] his father, you would have that same you
[1:26:44] would have that unity. You would have
[1:26:45] that unity. I say God shave me down.
[1:26:49] Hone me down Lord until I have the same
[1:26:51] mind. The mind that was in Christ Jesus
[1:26:55] living through me Lord.
[1:27:00] And he says they will be the very
[1:27:02] manifestation of the word of the living
[1:27:04] God. We either believe that or we don't.
[1:27:06] And I just say, "Lord, I believe it with
[1:27:08] all of my
[1:27:10] heart." This is what it means to be
[1:27:14] adopted. This is what the bo body change
[1:27:16] is even
[1:27:17] about. To take this body with its carnal
[1:27:23] carnality in so much to change it. I'm
[1:27:27] so looking forward to a change of this
[1:27:28] body. Amen.
[1:27:33] That's why I've said it and I'll say it
[1:27:34] again. To me, the body change is this
[1:27:37] flesh getting what my soul got
[1:27:42] when I was born of the spirit of God.
[1:27:44] Amen.
[1:27:46] This is what it means. And I'm not just
[1:27:48] sitting around waiting for a change,
[1:27:50] waiting for some misty day, some, you
[1:27:53] know, glorious day. Listen, friends, I'm
[1:27:54] waiting. I'm looking for it. But I
[1:27:56] believe that there's an activity of the
[1:27:58] Holy Ghost that wants to take place in
[1:28:01] my life right now. The Holy Ghost wants
[1:28:04] to be active. And I say, Lord, be
[1:28:07] active. Be active in not just in my
[1:28:09] soul, but in my spirit. Lord, be active,
[1:28:12] God. Uh, bring my body under full
[1:28:15] subjection to this word. Amen. How many
[1:28:18] want that here tonight? I'm out of time.
[1:28:20] Stand to your feet with me if you could.
[1:28:23] What ought it to do to us?
[1:28:27] What we need is a repentance. Amen. What
[1:28:30] we
[1:28:31] need is a revival.
[1:28:34] Could you bow your heads with me all
[1:28:37] over the
[1:28:53] building? Yes, Lord.
[1:29:05] God created me a
[1:29:09] revival. Oh, my hands go up,
[1:29:12] Lord. Let me
[1:29:14] be the revival.
[1:29:24] Sometimes
[1:29:26] Lord, we spend our whole
[1:29:29] life waiting for others to
[1:29:32] change, waiting for people to
[1:29:35] change, waiting for circumstances to
[1:29:39] change. And we
[1:29:42] miss that the change you want to do is
[1:29:45] not in others, not in people, but it's
[1:29:48] in us.
[1:29:52] So I just say Lord change
[1:29:56] me start with me
[1:29:59] Lord make me
[1:30:02] Lord that
[1:30:04] revival the revival in
[1:30:07] me make me if I don't Lord make me to
[1:30:13] hunger make me to
[1:30:16] thirst if I don't thirst for you Lord
[1:30:19] then create a thirst for you and you
[1:30:24] alone. If I don't hunger for your word,
[1:30:28] then Lord, I just ask quite simply in
[1:30:30] simple faith, put a hunger there for
[1:30:33] your word, Lord. Let it be my daily
[1:30:36] bread. Oh, let me go h let me have an
[1:30:39] appetite, Lord, to consume it, to
[1:30:42] consume Christ, the word. Not a one-time
[1:30:46] experience. Not something that happened
[1:30:48] years
[1:30:50] ago. Let me hunger for that fresh fresh
[1:30:55] kill of the word, that fresh carcass,
[1:30:58] that fresh
[1:31:00] mana. I'm so sick of the things of this
[1:31:02] world, feeding off the things of this
[1:31:05] life, sick and tired of the filth of
[1:31:08] this lady I see and
[1:31:10] age. Lord, I have no appetite for those
[1:31:13] kind of things.
[1:31:15] Forgive me if I fed on them too much,
[1:31:17] Lord. Forgive me if I've looked at them
[1:31:19] too much. Forgive me, Lord, if I became
[1:31:24] distracted. I just want to feed on you,
[1:31:27] Lord.
[1:31:30] God, would you create in me? I got hands
[1:31:32] raised to say this. Would you create in
[1:31:35] me that which is needed in me?
[1:31:41] Let me from this hour be thine more,
[1:31:44] more more dedicated servant, more
[1:31:47] consecrated, more blessed, more able,
[1:31:50] more humble. Yes, Lord. More
[1:31:52] humble, more kind. Yes, Lord. More
[1:31:57] kind, more willing to forgive
[1:32:00] and forget
[1:32:02] than to hold on and to pay back.
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:07] more looking to those things which are
[1:32:10] positive and not the negativity that
[1:32:13] this world so wants to feed me. Let me
[1:32:17] be the revival.
[1:32:20] Lord, help me to forget those things.
[1:32:23] How many want that? that are in the past
[1:32:26] and are negative and let me
[1:32:29] press every day of my life. Let me press
[1:32:33] towards the mark of the high calling of
[1:32:35] Christ. Oh, that's our desire, isn't it,
[1:32:37] friends? God, let me just say, don't let
[1:32:40] the spirit of revival die. God, if I if
[1:32:43] I if I'm in need of it, let me be honest
[1:32:45] enough to admit it. I need a revival,
[1:32:48] Lord. I need a fresh outpouring of the
[1:32:51] surge of the Holy Ghost to flow through
[1:32:54] and charge my very
[1:32:57] being. Not just more church and more
[1:32:59] church and more church. As your prophet
[1:33:02] taught us, revival isn't passed down
[1:33:04] from generation to generation. Even your
[1:33:07] word, even your your your Old Testament
[1:33:09] prophets taught us that you visit good
[1:33:12] things upon two and three
[1:33:15] generations. And if there's bad things
[1:33:17] and cursing, you'll visit it upon two
[1:33:19] and three
[1:33:21] generations. Lord, it makes us realize
[1:33:23] that we can live off two
[1:33:26] generations and live off the life of a
[1:33:28] revival. Three generations. That'd be 60
[1:33:31] years
[1:33:33] ago. But if we don't light the fire
[1:33:36] again, if we try to live off the past of
[1:33:39] what happened yesterday 60 years
[1:33:42] ago, Lord, we'll be just like that lady
[1:33:46] you see in church with matter in her
[1:33:48] eyes, unable to see
[1:33:52] ourself. So God, I just ask with my
[1:33:54] hands raised, Lord, come and bring a
[1:33:57] fresh revival to me, Lord. Yes, Jesus.
[1:34:00] Lord, you dealt with my heart even
[1:34:02] today, God. And it wouldn't leave my my
[1:34:05] mind, my spirit. Never let the spirit of
[1:34:09] revival die. And I just raised my hands,
[1:34:12] Lord, and said, "I need it, God. I need
[1:34:14] a revival. Lord, I'll be honest. I'll be
[1:34:16] the first one on this Wednesday night
[1:34:18] prayer meeting. I'll be the first one.
[1:34:20] If nobody else is willing, I'll be the
[1:34:22] first to say, "Brother Matt needs a
[1:34:24] revival." He needs it to start at the
[1:34:27] very soul, the very altar of his own
[1:34:30] heart. I need it, God. I need a fresh
[1:34:33] outpouring. I need a fresh light. I need
[1:34:35] a fresh vision. I pray you'd give it to
[1:34:38] me, Lord. I repent of myself. I repent
[1:34:41] of my sins. I repent of yesterday. I'm
[1:34:44] asking, God, for a fresh
[1:34:47] outpouring, not a one-time, not a
[1:34:50] one-off, but a daily striving. Your
[1:34:53] prophet said it was so easy in those
[1:34:54] days. He caught it easy just to be
[1:34:58] called a Christian. You could be your
[1:35:00] would would cost your life. And your
[1:35:02] prophet said it was so easy for them to
[1:35:04] get off the hook so easy. They could
[1:35:06] just confess Christ and be martyed and
[1:35:09] they're gone sealed. Testimonies over.
[1:35:12] It's what he called easy. He says, "Oh,
[1:35:14] but it's so much more harder for us
[1:35:17] because now we don't
[1:35:20] give. It's not those that have given,
[1:35:23] but a crown to those who have
[1:35:25] striven. Now, it's not about giving our
[1:35:28] life and sealing our blood with our
[1:35:30] testimony, but it's a daily striving, a
[1:35:33] daily dying, a daily grinding, a daily
[1:35:36] pressing, a daily pushing out, a daily
[1:35:40] emptying out and letting you come and
[1:35:42] fill me once again. So Lord, here I am
[1:35:44] saying, I'm empty, Lord. I'm emptying
[1:35:46] all of myself. And I'm asking you, God,
[1:35:49] to refill me once again.
[1:35:52] Lord, grant it Jesus, I
[1:35:55] pray my
[1:35:57] heart. Could we sing it, friends,
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:04] today, oh
[1:36:07] [Music]
[1:36:11] may Yes. Yes, Lord.
[1:36:15] [Music]
[1:36:18] Search me.
[1:36:21] [Music]
[1:36:23] Oh, let's sing this like a prayer now
[1:36:25] before we gather and take our
[1:36:29] knees.
[1:36:32] See, there be there
[1:36:37] be some wicked way in me.

[1:37:28] today. And
[1:37:30] know my
[1:37:33] heart today.
[1:37:38] Try to be your savior.
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:50] Try
[1:37:54] my friends.
[1:38:02] Heat. Heat.
[1:38:19] Somewhere in
[1:38:24] me. Is this your desire?
[1:38:27] [Applause]
[1:38:38] and
[1:38:41] set me that last verse
[1:38:46] free. Yes, I love
[1:38:49] this.
[1:38:54] Oh, we
[1:38:59] go. Yes, Lord.
[1:39:04] who
[1:39:06] comes through
[1:39:10] the prayer. So send a revival
[1:39:13] [Applause]
[1:39:17] sing
[1:39:22] revival. Start the work.
[1:39:26] Start the work. Oh, we should all raise
[1:39:30] our hands. We should all tell him that
[1:39:32] today. Start with me.
[1:39:43] Jesus. Here's what it
[1:39:46] says. Thou

[1:40:04] Sing
[1:40:07] now.
[1:40:09] Lord,

[1:40:33] verse.

[1:40:48] [Applause]
[1:40:55] and make
[1:41:08] me
[1:41:11] feel. Yes, Lord. With fire.
[1:41:17] Oh, do you feel that way?
[1:41:18] church. Where was where
[1:41:22] was
[1:41:28] I? Yes.
[1:41:40] [Applause]
[1:41:44] die to
[1:41:46] magnify
[1:41:48] my thy
[1:41:50] [Music]
[1:41:52] name. Amen. That's our prayer. Amen. How
[1:41:55] many want that? To search me, Lord.
[1:41:58] Amen. Search me. See if there be any
[1:42:00] way. Amen. And me. I love those words to
[1:42:03] that old song. I tell you what, we don't
[1:42:06] sing those old ones enough. I don't sing
[1:42:08] those enough. I should say those words
[1:42:11] are so rich. Revival fire comes from
[1:42:15] thee, Lord. Amen. We believe that we
[1:42:18] have prayer requests here. I just want
[1:42:19] to make sure we get them all. My dad

[1:43:58] minor cough. the Lord in my body. The
[1:44:00] Lord and my body are fighting it off but
[1:44:02] feeling worn down going into it. Need
[1:44:05] the strength of the Lord. Brother Ken
[1:44:07] Booze writes in, "I have a special
[1:44:08] unspoken prayer request tonight. I know
[1:44:10] Brother Tony also not able to be here
[1:44:13] lead worship tonight. His family gone. I
[1:44:15] know he's uh not feeling well and if
[1:44:17] there's any that I'm missing, I think I
[1:44:18] got one text." Um, also, yes, my uh son
[1:44:23] Gideon's uh former when he played high
[1:44:26] school basketball had a coach. Coach
[1:44:28] Paul is a Christian man, wonderful man
[1:44:30] from Ridgeland. And uh our family
[1:44:33] certainly liked him a lot. He was just a
[1:44:35] real good uh real real good person. So,
[1:44:38] he's been diagnosed with a very late
[1:44:40] stage, I don't know what it was, but
[1:44:42] late stage cancer. And so, they wanted
[1:44:44] us to to remember uh Coach Paul tonight.
[1:44:47] I don't see any other requests. Um, make
[1:44:50] sure I'm not missing
[1:44:54] any. Amen. Amen. Maybe you have
[1:44:58] something upon your heart. You didn't
[1:44:59] get time to turn in. You just want to
[1:45:01] raise a hand and believe. Why don't we
[1:45:03] just bind our faith together? Put your
[1:45:05] arm over on that person beside you.
[1:45:07] Let's just bind our hearts together in
[1:45:09] faith. Lord, we have serious needs, God,
[1:45:12] that been read, Lord. And if it were up
[1:45:14] to us, we'd be at a loss, Lord, for any
[1:45:17] of them. Wouldn't know what to do, Lord
[1:45:20] Jesus. For that's the strength of men.
[1:45:22] That's the strength of good doctors,
[1:45:24] Lord. Even, Father, have good tools and
[1:45:26] good medicine. But sometimes, Lord,
[1:45:28] they're the they they the answer, the
[1:45:31] only answer can be found in you, Lord.
[1:45:34] And we look to you. We look to your
[1:45:35] promises tonight, Father, Lord. But we
[1:45:38] look to a cross, something that has
[1:45:41] already been completed. Your prophet
[1:45:43] taught us if Jesus were standing here in
[1:45:45] flesh, he couldn't do any more for us
[1:45:48] than he already did, Lord. So we claim
[1:45:51] that blood right now as a church behalf
[1:45:54] of my dad, Lord, who's suffering at
[1:45:56] home. God, I pray that you'd be a healer
[1:45:59] to him right now. God, may you restore
[1:46:01] him to full strength. Satan, we rebuke
[1:46:04] you and and rebuke this attack of the
[1:46:07] enemy of sickness coming through
[1:46:09] affecting our church. Pray for all of
[1:46:11] those, Lord. the request that we've
[1:46:13] turned in with various sicknesses.
[1:46:15] Sister Sarah, Lord, in the hospital now,
[1:46:17] Brother Josh with the stomach bug.
[1:46:20] Brotherh brother Brother JD not feeling
[1:46:22] well. Troy, Lord, even with this need in
[1:46:25] the ER, God, but I just have one thing
[1:46:28] to say. You are greater than all of
[1:46:30] these requests, Lord. Your word is still
[1:46:33] the same today as it was when it was
[1:46:35] written. And we're believers of it, God.
[1:46:37] your prophet taught us, as long as
[1:46:39] there's a person who will believe the
[1:46:41] word, it proves there's still a God who
[1:46:43] will back up that word. So God, we
[1:46:45] believe it, we claim it, we confess it
[1:46:47] tonight in Jesus' name for all of these
[1:46:50] requests, Lord. And Father, if I missed
[1:46:52] any, Lord Jesus, may you forgive me,
[1:46:54] brother Ken. Lord, this special unspoken
[1:46:57] need, Lord. for all these hands that
[1:46:59] have an unspoken prayer request upon
[1:47:01] their heart. Lord, may we see
[1:47:02] testimonies come from these requests on
[1:47:05] this Wednesday night prayer meeting.
[1:47:07] Lord, for Coach Paul, Lord, also for
[1:47:09] Anelise, Lord, I'm reminded who's home
[1:47:11] sick. I pray, God, that you'd bring
[1:47:13] healing. May a wave of healing, Lord,
[1:47:15] the son of righteousness arise with a
[1:47:17] healing in his wings upon our whole
[1:47:20] church. Lord, may we come back here
[1:47:21] Sunday full strength, Lord Jesus. God,
[1:47:24] may you deliver Sister Sarah, God,
[1:47:26] suffering there in the hospital right
[1:47:28] now. God, you are that you're the need
[1:47:30] meter. We believe, Lord God, that you're
[1:47:33] that nothing, Lord God, is too hard for
[1:47:36] you. As you told Abraham, Lord,
[1:47:38] nothing's impossible as you said to
[1:47:40] those that believe. And we are believers
[1:47:42] of your promises tonight. Meet every
[1:47:45] single one, Lord, in their request. We
[1:47:47] pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[1:47:51] You got something else we could sing?
[1:47:59] Oh, could we raise our hands and sing
[1:48:01] that like a prayer to the Lord? Create
[1:48:04] in me a clean
[1:48:06] heart. Create
[1:48:09] me a clean
[1:48:13] heart. Oh God, that's our prayer.
[1:48:20] and renew arise
[1:48:22] spirit within
[1:48:25] me. Oh, cast me not away. Oh, and cast
[1:48:31] me not
[1:48:34] away from my
[1:48:41] presence and
[1:48:44] take my holy spirit.
[1:48:53] Yes.

[1:49:49] joy, my

[1:50:03] before we go. I want to make sure we
[1:50:04] have an opportunity. Got that microphone
[1:50:07] wireless somewhere. Amen. Give brother
[1:50:10] Enoch different ones a chance. You can
[1:50:12] keep playing something soft, but Amen. I

[1:50:16] on? There we go, Enoch. Amen. All right.
[1:50:19] So, a couple weeks ago, I fell off my
[1:50:22] bike and I busted my lip um really bad.
[1:50:26] I think my tooth almost went through it
[1:50:28] and it was really bad. But luckily, God
[1:50:33] started healing it right away. And now I
[1:50:35] am 100% recovered. Not even a scratch.

[1:51:08] they were basically saying like you're
[1:51:10] going to have a C-section and she really
[1:51:11] didn't want a C-section cuz a lot of
[1:51:13] health complications come up with that.
[1:51:14] So they were praying and everybody was
