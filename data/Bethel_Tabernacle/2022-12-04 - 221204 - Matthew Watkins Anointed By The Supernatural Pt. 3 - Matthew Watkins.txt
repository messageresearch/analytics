into the U-Haul and I remembered my rings when they did that we looked everywhere couldn't find them Rings nowhere looked in the grass we finally found one and I was just sick and so we got here we

glory praise the Lord are you glad that he lives this morning amen praise the Lord certainly amen so thankful for that and that we have him and his presence and that's all that matters amen God bless you amen let's turn in their Bible to Joshua chapter 4. we'll just go straight to the word this morning Joshua chapter 4 just going to read a few verses here amen Joshua chapter 4. amen well we didn't expect to be here this morning standing here when we preached Wednesday and uh and so we we're just uh glad that the Lord had something in his mind and wanted to go a little bit further with this so I trust that you came hungry Amen in an expectation how many just appreciated the word and the spirit that we heard Wednesday not just what was said but the spirit of God that moved in this church I believe that Spirit brother random said that lingers so that same spirit's still here today all you got to do is tap into it amen get get out of this Earthly amen and I'm gonna go right with you amen and go into that other dimension amen Joshua chapter four we're just going to remember all those that are sick also and now we've prayed we're going to ask again here for special prayer all those that are out of church this morning at home streaming because of a flu bug going around a different one sick and um brother Keith Brown I don't know if this got announced or not was supposed to be speaking today and Mr charity uh came down with flu symptoms so they went home and then Mom and Dad got it uh still filling some flu symptoms this morning so they're at home streaming and I'm sure there's many others so we just but we we believe in healing amen we believe in an atonement that didn't just save us but also heals us and heals our body and so we want to ask the Lord to remember those that are out this morning and so we're going to pray for those needs here in just a moment I would like to discontinue on from where we were Wednesday on anointed by the supernatural and it came to pass when all of the people were clean past over Jordan that the Lord spoke unto Joshua saying take you 12 men out of the people out of every tribe of man and command you them saying take you hints out of the midst of Jordan out of the place where the priest feet stood firm so this was specific to the Lord out of a certain spot you're going to take these Stones go into the river don't just grab any don't just pick up any stone because there was going to be a significance that was going to take place years after this event of the crossing of Jordan you're going to see that here in just a moment but he says here go out of let's read it again commanding them saying take you hints out of the midst of Jordan out of the place where the priest's feet stood firm 12 Stones and you shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you shall Lodge this night then Joshua called the 12 men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel out of every tribe of man and Joshua said unto them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what menu by these stones or Daddy what do these Stones mean what's this all about what's all these things we talk about what's all this about and he says when your children ask what menu by these Stones then you shall answer them that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan that's as important we spoke Wednesday on this same river that Elijah and Elisha cross it's the same river that Joshua crosses and he says let's read it again he says and you shall answer them verse 7 the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off and these Stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever Lord Jesus we just bow our heads now in your presence Lord and Lord how much we have a need from you this morning Lord all of us would be various Lord those that are sick in body not feeling well different sicknesses Lord going around we just ask God and pray a special prayer Lord this church we lift up our voices right now asking you great physician to go and touch our pastor Lord father and my mom Lord I pray for sister charity Brown Lord the different ones maybe I won't even mention this morning but you're mindful of them Lord You're mindful of even the sparrow Lord and I pray God that you would be mindful of them this morning Lord of us here today God how there's not one of us Lord that is gathered in this building this morning Lord without some need inside of our heart some reason Lord God that maybe that we're here today and maybe praying about what would be various Lord and God I just pray Lord as even I stand here in great need of you Lord in your help I pray God that you would help send an unction lord of the Holy Spirit father that you you would allow me to speak these things that you've burned and put inside of My Heart Lord I pray God not just for me as I would speak Lord but father help these Lord that are here today Lord to create the right atmosphere for we know Lord that atmosphere is so important Lord to create the right atmosphere I pray God that you would help us to do that this morning as we discontinue Lord in the Sunday morning worship service to Worship You Lord now God may you take your word Lord and may you speak we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated this morning we picked up left off in what house will you build me and I want you to go and display that PowerPoint if you could and I'm just going to read this to cap some of these things that we spoke on Wednesday and brother Brandon begins to give Express his desire for the Tucson Tabernacle in Tucson Arizona and it's 1965 what house will you build me he's coming as we said on Wednesday to some of the last things he would speak some of his last thoughts as we spoke on Wednesday on the transfer of that burden or the transfer of that inheritance just as Elisha asks for a double portion of Elijah's spirit because he needed that mantle and he understood that when he was in Jordan and he wouldn't stay and Elijah says Terry here and I said Lord is my soul liveth I'll not leave thee but I'll go with you I'll stick with you I'll stay beside you and so Elisha was not going to stop in Bethel until he had the mantle that Elijah was wearing and that mantle was representative of a promise or a purpose that the Lord had had it was representative of a burden that God had placed upon this man Elijah and with that burden there was promises that was given unto Elijah and Elisha knew that in order to to pass over Jordan again I'm going to need that same power I'm going to need that same burden I'm going to need that same anointing I'm going to need that same God but not just the same or else he would have said give me what you have but Elijah realized he needed more than what he Elisha realized he needed more than what Elijah had somebody following me this morning so he says give me a double portion of what you had let that Spirit be a double Let It Be magnified in two times what you have and I believe it's so representative of the age that we live in today that we need a double portion of the anointing that was on the messenger has to come on to the bride there's got to be a transfer of that same expectation of that same Faith the prophet would say it this way there's got to come a rapturing faith upon the people and before we can ever have a Rapture in faith there's got to be an expectation there's got to be a burden there's got to be something that that burns inside of them an expectation and it so he begins to list some of his last things that he's going to say in this church here he speaks um and I don't remember the title I was just hearing it just the other day and the prophet of God is saying this to a church in Arizona and he starts saying you Brothers here he said I he said I didn't want to I didn't want to have a church here I don't want to cause a controversy amongst you Assemblies of God and some of you that are in the Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness and some of you in the Baptist Church and even points to some of the brothers who were there in that meeting that were uh in a Catholic church and brother Bynum says him he says but I sat here for three years and you never invited me to preach in your pulpits you never had me speak I was here in the desert for three years and now brother green has opened up a church you know brother green it was so incredible do you know why brother green said he brother Perry green opened a church in Tucson Arizona why he started a church and left Beaumont Texas he was the superintendent of a denomination there and he leaves Beaumont Texas thank you brother Tony he leaves Beaumont Texas and he and he and he leaves everything my Grandpa and Grandma were there with brother Green in Beaumont before he went to Arizona and had my grandpa went with brother green I'd probably be living in Arizona right now but he didn't the Lord had other plans and brother green goes to Arizona and he starts a church and I thought it was so incredible that brother green says the reason I I started the Tucson Tabernacle at church is that I wanted a place of worship that I can come into and say the name William Branham and it not offend anybody that was his reason he started a church was that so he could preach the message and not have to explain it or be offend anybody by it and you hear Brother Brian I'm saying I'm so glad I've got churches that have opened the door uh to my Ministry and have caught the inspiration listen to some of these things he says here it's uh just I thought was so profound to that church here this this one doesn't work guys I don't know what happened to the good one if you got another one of these Logitech ones back there please bring it if not just go ahead and Advance the slide press the next Arrow notice this the next one uh there he says but we this is what house will you build me but we as this group of people unless we read Wednesday we'll get we'll we'll cover that again we have a message for this day we believe that God has given us a message and brother green has I don't know what to call him my associate because we are well it is also my associate we're together in this message brother green preaches the same thing and message that I believe in he has left his home he has left his people he has left his church he was I believe he was a district superintendent or something of one of them one of the organizations and give the whole thing up when he heard this he left everything that was dear to him also to come to the desert just to support what God is giving to us now let me stop and emphasize it cannot be overemphasized enough that there was a generation of people who left everything to come to this now what about the generation of people I included who didn't have to leave anything but were raised up in the message you didn't have to sacrifice and leave a home or leave a church or leave a family and leave everything to come to this let me just say until you leave everything until you leave every thought every previous idea all opinions listen we're not a church full of opinions we've got the Vindicated the saith the Lord from God's prophet and it's not a matter of opinion or what I think or your perspective or my perspective but we leave everything say why brother Matt because we want that same anointing that was on Elijah to come to Elisha and you'll never receive in it questioning Elijah well amen he says we he's left everything he left everything was dear to him and also to come to the dead just to support what he's given us now go to the next slide I say I believe it's not only should be in our hearts it should be our duty to back him up everything that we can to attend the services to come here to worship to make this a place where God can reveal to us the things that he has for us to reveal I say we ought to support the church we ought to support the pastor we ought to attend the services hello this was his desire for his church in Tucson and as his word said this is Brother Branham quoting what brother green had said on the tape before brother Branham takes the pulpit and as his word said the message doesn't come to me this is Brother green through the giving of the inspiration as it did does maybe to some of us but he said I am here to back up what God has given let me just say brother Matt is here to back up what God has given how many would join me and say I am here to back up and to support what God has given Glory and he says I'm here to back up what a statement brother Burnham says and I believe if we will cooperate together we'll put our hearts to it next next I know that each of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it this is what was burning in brother random's heart he's about to lose in November in December he'll he'll be he'll be in a car accident just in just a few months a few weeks later and here's what's on his heart after the seals after the Mysteries are unfolded after the revelation of the word after the Mighty God unveiled and brother Branham saying I'm so hungry I just can't hardly stand it some experiences I've had just up in the mountain just to feel that once again that's something that when I was first Saved he goes back to all the all the way back to the first initial experience he had when he got saved and here he is at the end of his life and he's Longing For What the Lord did him did for him years before this and he says and we can Wicked place we can sit we could see it among us that we're drying as we sit here in the desert I get among my brother and they talk with me and I talk with him always in a little way of watching filling out there with the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong keep keep going follow with me I begin to fill us all reclining I begin to feel us I'm so hungry to see the power of God I'm so hungry I could just hardly stand it but I begin to fill us all reclining getting away from the spirit it's became too natural a thing to us and he says we must Worship in the spirit where the spirit of God is Not only our message should be the flame of the hour I love this it should be the flame in our hearts it's got to be in our hearts or we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself they may never hear what you say but they'll feel the spirit that you carry and that'll make the way for what you want to say go on go on and now that brother green God has sent him in here and opened us up a church of like Precious faith that we believe in we ought to be very grateful to God and attend every service take every place that we can take every place I'd miss stopping here because I feel the Holy Spirit take every place we ought to be very grateful to God that we've got a church that we could come to we ought to be very grateful to God that there's a local body of Believers that we can worship with we ought to be because there's some people who don't have that privilege aren't in a place of life where they can go to a body Believers and Worship the Lord in Freedom and in truth we ought to be very grateful to God and attend every service take every place take every place take every place what's he saying here don't just come and give us your person your presence your personal well I've graced you I'm here aren't I I'm at the church on our brother Brandon says take every place if you see a spot that needs food fill that spot take that place and if we're asked to call on to pray to seek to do let's be soldiers just anxious to do it keep the message honorable live the right kind of life we're living too late now this is the last words Elijah's saying to Elisha this is the last burden upon his heart this is what he wanted to instill this is the Mandate he wanted to pass on this is the commission he was commissioning Elisha with keep the message honorable how many want that here today live the right kind of Life come on I need your help preaching this morning live the right kind of life don't let no smut come upon it Lord help me to not let any smut come upon it help me Lord to keep it honorable to live the right kind of life we're living too late now we're too late in an hour let's live it clean I wonder if that would resonate with somebody here this morning well my life your life all of our Lives need to be picked up before God our young people just ride around from place to place from show to show drifting further and further away from God right now that's the truth I see it in my children and I see myself getting to a place where not listen you you've got to assemble ourselves together to worship God the Bible said so when we see this day approaching that much more come together if there's only two people here you be one of them [Applause] if we come together and worship together then we just something another about it Jesus said we're two or three are gathered in my name there I am in their midst go back thank you there I am this was the passion this was the desire this is what he was placing this was is what he was instilling this is what was upon his heart this is what he wanted to say this is what he wanted to pass down this is what he wanted to pass on if he had a few burdens he could leave with the church if his voice could say up something if he could pass something on to them if his voice could speak today this morning this is the this is the burden he'd want to pass on this is the the the the the the this is the uh uh uh prayer that he would pray and I think I think it's significant to understand this because lest we go beyond the message unless time goes on and then we forget the initial burden we forget the original purpose you know as brother Brandon says they always the the he says there's always been a spirit that will always try to come in and change this or change that or paint this up or dress this up over here or modernize this and reculture it over here there's always that Spirit we're always having to fight against that spirit and so he says this is the original purpose this is the original burden I want you to move on down Noah to slide uh 21. we're just gonna Skip and then we'll come back the way the lord gave me this y'all forgive me I'm on short notice this morning and it's always so get in the spirit listen to what in the message in the in the Patmos Vision he says he's quoting the scripture here I was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful my I love that you could just call those words the whole of the Christian Life I was in the spirit if we're going to live as Christians we have to be in his Spirit John was not talking about being in his own spirit that would not have brought these Visions it had to be the spirit of God it has to be the spirit of God With Us to all of our efforts or all of our efforts are in vain Paul said I will pray in the spirit I will sing in the spirit I will live in the spirit if there is anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it bears as surely as John needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given to us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit so this this was some of the original things because that's what we're going to be talking about here today some of the some of the initial purpose or the original blessing or the original burden that was upon Elijah has to be passed to Elisha and here was one of the foundational principles this is what's happening in Joshua in our scripture here it was the foundational Stones when they're passing over Jordan there's going to be a miracle take place something that is uh happens in Joshua it also happens in Elisha and Elijah but here it is with Joshua and the the Jordan waters are going to part they're going to separate for them to pass over Jordan and so what's going to happen it's a fresh generation of people this is not the generation that comes out of Egypt are you hearing me this is not them that came out of Egypt they died in the wilderness as God spoke to Moses and said their carcasses will fall in the wilderness but there's an entire new generation of people who weren't raised in the message who never seen Egypt who never came out of Egypt and God tells Joshua re-circumcise the new generation circumcised the new generation in other words let them have the same experience as the first experience because if you don't have an experience of leaving something and forsaking something you'll never appreciate that something but when you leave it and you forsake something then you hold dear what the Lord has given you and so he says have the 12 priests out of every tribe of man they're going to pass over Jordan so they go through Jordan they cross the river and then God says now I want you to take he says I want you to take a stone out of every place where the priest feet stood firm 12 Stones notice this isn't just random it's not just any stone in the Jordan River but he specifies in our scripture out of the place where the priest's feet stood firm in other words wherever they were standing when they were standing and crossing the Jordan Joshua tells them I want you to take a man and he says and I want you come here brother he says I want you to take a man and he says I want you to take a stone and he says and out of the Jordan River pick up a stone right so it picks up that stone wherever the priest feet here's a priest right here come here stand here brother stand right here come here brother you stand right here we got enough Johnsons we can make all the first all 12 tribes come here come here come here Chris come here brother Steve Chris I want you to face I want you to face here brother Stephen wants you to face this brother come here Josh come here Rome and come here Caleb is that Caleb come here Chris come here oh we got enough we got enough okay I want to have it just like this okay turn you ready now this is what God says the the priests are going to go into the water here's all of the priests they're going to go into the water and when the priest feet the priesthood when they touched the Jordan not before but they have to have enough faith when they're putting their foot in the water that Jordan's gonna Park you know sometimes you don't see the evidence of what God's doing until you take a step of faith and put your foot in the water it wasn't going to be when they waited God was going to do it like Moses when he takes a staff and here's God's Prophet this is not the Prophet this is the priest this is not the Moses Ministry of Moses this is the ministry of Joshua the Holy Ghost and so Moses takes the staff and all the people are are are there and he takes a staff plants it in the joy in the Red Sea and the waters come up like Billows but here now the dispensation of priests and so he he puts his feet in the water and Jordan Parts Waters begin to separate then you notice the next priest you could you could see the water pardon he goes to stand and then the water Parts a little bit more and he stands here then the water Parts a little bit more and before you know it there's a pathway going to over to Canaan through Jordan but you first got to come through who the anointed priest that God has placed in the Jordan River and by their lives or their Ministry backing up what Moses had said backing up what God had said through Moses listen they weren't going to come and try to change something or give their opinions they were eunuchs they didn't have a seat of their own they didn't have a thought coming of their own they were just going to say what he said they were going to preach what he preached they weren't going to change it if they did it wouldn't have worked but those priests job were to be faithful to the law that God had given and so when they stood in the water and that priest what was Jordan to represent what was the river representative of death sin that's what the prophet teaches it represents sin and it represents death so when a priest who's anointed by God and commissioned by a prophet stands in death he is commissioned to hold death back from his family let me say that again when a man of God I'm not just talking about preachers I'm talking about any Son of God that is that is Anointed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost when he puts his foot into sin or to death that is trying to creep into his home he is commissioned by God to hold sin out of his family's life he's commissioned by God to hold the devil out of his gateways to his home are you with me Church do you realize that the people are passing through the waters because there's an anointed priesthood who is preaching what Moses preached and now death stays out of their life and sin stays out of their homes now let me ask you something what happens if the priest decides you know that was just brother branham's opinion and I really don't know about that and then that priest steps out of the water and then this priest overhears steps and goes you know I just don't know guys this is a new modern generation we gotta we gotta change it it doesn't exactly work here I'm just gonna I'm just gonna sit down I I you know I'm just gonna take a seat I'll just push play we really don't need that anymore do you know what happens when priests don't stand in their post of Duty and preach what Moses is for what Moses preached sin comes into the church compromise comes into the families lukewarmness creeps into the home when a priest doesn't stand in his position oh let me just preacher today and say I'm not gonna you might want to give up on the Promises of God you might want to change the message and what Elijah said I'm going to stand with my foot on the promise God gave me and I'm going to preach it the way he preached it and I'm not coming out of Jordan I'm not taking my foot out of the water I'm going to preach at Gun Barrel Street you say why brother Matt because it's because if I don't and we compromise then sin is like a tidal wave waiting at any moment for someone to step out of their position so it can flood our churches and flood our young people and flood our marriages and flood our music and flood our pastor and flood our our ministry and flood our churches listen friends I don't want Jordan in any part of my life how many would stand with me would raise a hand and say I don't want Jordan and any part of my home and in part of my mind any part of my spirit I want to say thank God for a Ministry that will preach the message of the hour without compromise do I have a church that's thankful and we'll say thank you our brothers and Pastor who will preach the unadulterated word hallelujah and not change it and not compromise on it and not regenerate it or modernize it but will preach it the way God said it amen thank you Brothers now God says Joshua I want you to go over and I want you to take the stone where his foot was so here's here's that man who got ordained to come out of to represent Reuben to represent Simeon to represent Manasseh these are the these are the names this is the generation this is the family of God and God says I want you Joshua to take a stone so where his right foot was stay there take that stone his right foot was right there I want you to lift that stone and place it here now come over here take this Stone here was his left foot his left foot was on this Stone right it wasn't on that stone it wasn't on that over that wasn't on what this brother said or with that bro what they said over here about three gods or or you know baptism in a church no no his foot stood on one God to baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to place it right here oh over here oh oh so over here it wasn't his his foot was right here his foot was on this Stone now this priest over here his foot was on this Stone what were these Stones representative of the original faith that was delivered to the Saints it was what he stood upon it's what he preached it's what Luther preached through justification and Wesley preached their sanctification and Pentecost preached through the restoration of the gifts back to the body and so he says take these specific stones don't change it because this is where they stood firm this is where God's Prophet stood firm though doors were shut to him though he was his ministry was rejected those said I said unto some for three years you never invited me so did that mean he would change his ministry so that he'd get invitations to other churches no he stood firm it cost him his family it cost him his friends it cost him his health but his foot stood firm and so God the Lord tells Joshua take those stones because those stones are going to represent something to the Next Generation because there's coming a generation of that that generation will go through the Wilderness though through Canaan that generation may pass off the scene but there's come in a Revival when children young people begin to look into the message for themself and say hey what does this mean what does this mean Dad and God Joshua said the Lord tells Joshua so that you can point back not to the opinion not to that not to what you think but you could point back to the Vindicated word and say when God sent a Revival and God sent a prophet he separated us from the world he separated us from denominational ideas he separated us from compromise he separated us from a life of sin he separated us to not look like the world not dressed like the world not act like the world not go to the places that the world goes Jordan was clean we cleaned passed over it and the Waters of Jordan were separated and so that that next Generation could receive a Revival not by asking mom and dad hello it was good for Mom and Dad to tell the stories it was good for Mom and Dad to to to teach the children but those children who would receive the Revival had to go all the way back to the first foundations of when the church was laid on the day of Pentecost and they would have to receive that same experience original experience that original flame that original fire listen to what brother random says here this is some foundational things here's some Stones where the priests feet stood firm Paul said I pray in the spirit I'll sing in the spirit if there's anything good uh he says let's go to the next slide brother Noah the next one after that he says now he was in the spirit he got in the spirit then things begin to take place notice here maybe he was dancing jumping running all around the island he was having a good time he was in the spirit so that may sound sacrilegious but I don't mean it that way he says he could well he might have been doing that I believe he was having a good time in the spirit just praising God because that's exactly what happened when the spirit fell on them at the first place when the Holy Ghost fell on them they staggered like drunk men and women and acted like they were drunk and jabbering and carried on like that until the people said these people are full of new wine that's the way they acted the first time so the Spirit come again he probably acted the same way I love this statement there's nothing new about this this thing this is an old-time religion what is the message of the hour there's nothing new about the message over the hour it's an old time it's the old-time religion Hallelujah he says pray to God for Revelation for a revelation by spirit that is the first step get in the spirit I'm just going to preach that here for a moment I could have titled my sermon that get in the spirit I mean it's you use another illustration suppose you need healing what is God's words what does the word say well we've read it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it I never knew brother Branham said this still I read this in patna's vision he says we've read it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it did we ask God for his Spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we would call the Elders confess our sins be anointed and prayed for and that would be that it might not come immediately but in his spirit it's all over there's no other court of appeal God will fulfill his word oh we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch God watch what God will do so what is the two keys to a promise of God being transferred off of the Bible into my life first get in the spirit and then go through the acts hello it's twofold you don't just get in the spirit and not go through the ax you don't just go in the ACT through the acts a lot of people go through the acts of emotions but they never got in the spirit but a lot of people get in the spirit but they never are willing to go through the acts you say what are some of the acts saying Amen to the word of God as part of the acts with your vocal cords and your voice amening the word if you need if you need prayer you get up out of your seat you come to an altar that's going through the acts when I anoint you with oil and we begin to pray that's going through the acts how can you ever expect God to fulfill his word if you're not willing to go through the acts brother Bradham said that he said a lot of people he said a lot of people are are expecting God to give them something they never asked for you gotta ask well I thought the Lord knows my heart brother Adam says you gotta ask a lot of people are waiting for God I just know God's going to do it you got to ask first you've got to go through the acts I'm going to keep reading this have you ever noticed how the world gets in the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ball games they're sporting events and their dances they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like Wallflowers come on Church they don't sit there like Wallflowers I've been with you watching some of your games you don't sit there like Wallflowers you get excited you're you're for your team what are you doing you're getting in the spirit of it oh how much more do we have something so much greater than a ball game or a football game we have the power of the Living God moving amongst us how much more should we get in the spirit of our church services you get in the spirit of it they in a ride into the he says they don't they don't sit there like Wallflowers old dried up sticks they enter right into the fill of things and become a part of things but oh how they hate us Christians forgetting in the spirit of God's word they call us Fanatics and holy rollers there's nothing that they won't do to show their hatred or disapproval but I love this but ignore that you can expect it knowing where it's coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship don't worry about what the critic says don't worry about what the traditionalist says just go ahead and get in the spirit of it Hallelujah the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it Savers and delights in its pleasures both Christians and the world are human both have emotions the difference is the Christians hearts and emotions are purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh I don't know about you but I can identify and say Lord my heart is purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love he said brother Matt is that important it's important that we get in the flesh you know that's been so so talked about you're getting in the flesh as if it was a bad thing David in Psalms 139 I think it says I will praise the Lord he says I will give glory to the Lord in my flesh I read you the quote just Wednesday night brother Brandon says God will be so real in their bodies which is their flesh you say it's not all speak with tongues absolutely not all I didn't speak in tongues when I was first born of the spirit of God I did years later have many times since that doesn't mean that you'll speak in tongues but did you know just while we're here while we're here did you know that speaking in tongues in the gifts of prophets the gift of Prophecy and interpretation is the only thing in the entire New Testament Bible that you are allowed to covet thou shall not covet anything except speaking in tongues well you don't believe me then you don't believe the Bible because that's what the Apostle Paul said he says Brethren covet ask that you may prophesy that you may speak in dunks but more that you may prophesy in other words give an interpretation to it not all speak in tongues most of the time people listen a lot of the times you get you get an individual who doesn't shout or doesn't dance that's because they don't shout or dance at ball games or any other kind of event they express themselves in a different way that's okay so long as you're expressing yourself hello so long as you're letting the freedom of the Holy Spirit have its way it doesn't matter who you are we don't have a bunch of lookalikes we don't all act the same way the point is we get out of ourself and out of our shell and out of our being to do something to get God's attention there's not I'm just going to stop here there's not one single emotion that you should look for but let me say this you something has to happen I say that on the basis of God's Prophet something will happen that something may be different but something will happen something that's exact quote from questions and answers when he's asked about those that believe the message with all their heart yet they've never had a Pentecostal experience they've never had these signs should they he says brother Brandon do they have the Holy Ghost or do they still need it brother Brandon gives one simple story the story of a candle and he says you have the candle you have the wick you have the Tallow you have all the wax you have the vessel and he says that you've got all the ingredients and brother random points to those ingredients as the fruits of the spirit you have all of the degree all you're made up of all of the word of God you have everything in order brother random says but until that candle received the lighting of the flame it's not born again it's exactly what he answers and questions and answers and it takes the lighting of the flame something happens and it's not just a knowledge or an Enlightenment or rationalizing a mental greeting agreeing that's not Revelation Revelation is when something strikes your heart and it brings stimulation by revelation listen to me friends he that though all those things is the Holy Ghost the Bible says the Holy Ghost is the spirit of wisdom if you need Wisdom ask for God he'll Grant it I just read you a verse out of the Bible needeth thou Wisdom ask the Lord and He Shall give it to thee Solomon asked and the lord gave it to him you need wisdom knowledge understanding but listen true conversion moves beyond the human mind it moves Beyond human emotion it moves and it happens in the soul yet both Realms recognize it it did in every case in the Bible every single one of them in the book of Acts so let me just move on through some of this but let me just stop and say you say brother Matt does that mean something we have to do there there has to be something take place do you know that that brother branham's with banks woods and he throws up a rock in the air what was that rocket was a physical doing so he didn't just think think something in his mind and then brother random says Ah caught your thought there brother Woods no no no he picks up a rock and he throws it up in the air and brother random says when that rock he said it spun around three times and it created just a little disturbance in the atmosphere just the disturbance in the atmosphere and he says and then it began to spin and he says when that Whirlwind landed it landed on Alaska and nearly sunk it what was that that was a person physically doing something and then God in the Supernatural reacting and responding what does the Bible say call upon the name of the Lord and you shall be saved it doesn't say think upon the name of the Lord it says call upon the name of the Lord I'm just going to keep preaching this to you believe it because it's the truth when Jesus prays for a man he takes mud he spits into the dirt and makes UPS why did Jesus do that what was he doing because there was a representation with something physically that had a supernatural consequence when brother when he threw throws up the Rock brother random says it Disturbed the atmosphere you know sometimes when you're going through hell and some of us are going through hell on Earth in our lives you know sometimes the devil is gets you to Stew and it'll get you to think about it and you get so down in your mind and you're struggling with that thing and that pressure sometimes what you ought to do is use your vocal cords and your voice and curse that Spirit out loud and it might just disturb that atmosphere enough to break that Spirit out of your life why do we verbally say Amen to the word of God when the preacher's preaching to disturb the atmosphere to move out of this Earthly to get the Heavenly to come down that's why people stand to their feet and Shout not to be emotional though it's all right to be emotional it's to disturb you're doing something physically when Hattie Wright speaks I know we used this last time but when Hattie Wright spoke and said that's nothing but the truth brother Brandon and brother Brandon says that moved heaven I I thought about that what would have happened had had he not spoke hello what if she would have just thought about it and in her mind that's the truth I mean friends I'm just going to hear that I'm just gonna tell you what a prophet said when she spoke those words and she spoke them and when you speak something enters the atmosphere that's troubling you and it breaks something that's why the Bible says let the redeemed of the Lord say so I could go on and on and on and on and on and on about it there was something physical that was attached to the supernatural this is why emotion matters to God responding to the preaching of the word matters to God you say why brother Matt because this was the original flame listen to what brother Brandon says here and go back up to the very first quotes Palmer worm uh Locust canker worm it's slight 10 brother Noah listen what brother Adam says here now we know that we can only build a church first upon the material that God gave us to build it with that's all we have and I think I know this is strong in its own tape hundreds of people around the world will hear it but before we can ever have a building the Church of God will have to restore back all those things that these insects has ate out of it will have to go back before you can go forward you got to go back and find out what the insects hate before this Vine of the Lord the Grapevine he's the vine we're the branches before we can ever find out or the church can stand in its formal and a farmer and original Power will have to go back and find out what the insects ate and the church will have to be restored back to that what are we preaching on some of the original Stones where the priest feet stood firm the church before it will ever stand in its glory and its first standing now the first thing the church was established on the day of Pentecost Peter preached the inauguration sermon at thee and I'm not going to pronounce that word when the church was born my son had one and I couldn't even pronounce it then some of you uh educated people can give me that word church was born it's the inauguration that's what brother Brandon's point is and he says the church was born the Christian church was born on the day of Pentecost and if God is infinite infinite cannot change his church must remain the same as it was at the beginning do you admit that the church must remain the same as it was listen here listen close to what I want to tell you the ever knowledge anybody reading with me come on call off that false Doctrine the ever understanding the ever education the ever Behavior no it's not what he said the ever presence that's him his person his presence of the Living God is the lifeline of any church not the personality not the Charisma of the man not his gift that he has not how good the music is though we love good music and we got some of the best can I get it amen we got good song leading some of the best we got good church we got good gifts but listen that is not the lifeline of Bethel Tabernacle what is the lifeline of this church the presence of the Living God is the lifeline of the church you could cut everything else out but have that and you'd have all you need or any bunch of people the ever presence of the Living God to perform and to do and to act and to live with the people as he did at the beginning if the presence of the Living God brought a Pentecost with power with signs with wonders brought a people so full of the glory of God till they shouted and spoke with other languages and went and martyrs for the faith brother random says let's earnestly contend for that faith until death shall set us free earnestly fight earnestly struggle earnestly contend don't compromise let us earnestly contend for it if God brought forth his first Branch out of that vine was a Pentecostal Branch with power Visions Revelations healing sanctification Holy Spirit the next Branch will be the same thing it will be the same thing certainly will every time that vine puts forth a branch it'll be exactly like the first one was at the first place the martyrs stood there without a bat of his eye he knewed where he was standing he know who he had believed he was able knowing this that God could raise him up in the last day because he promised before he'd bowed down to any man-made old dirty rack sap line he'd die on that stump Hallelujah let me die the same place if my God doesn't come in my generation here's what Elijah said to Elijah I'll die on the stump where the canker worms ate to it believing that Jesus Christ and his church and his word is the same yesterday today and forever I'll die on this stump let my voice be this I might not be able to produce it out of all these branches because old sap lines here of denomination and Creed cut me off and drop me out like a hot potato that might be true but I'll Stand loyal on the stump and cry that that hour will come God will restore his church to its former condition Hallelujah you say brother Matt what are you preaching listen I'm going to read you one more the messenger Malachi 4 Revelations 10 7 is going to do two things according to the Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders and Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally physically turn the hearts of the children to the Baptist fathers oh I read that wrong it'll literally turn the hearts of the children back to the pilgrim Holiness back to the Assemblies of God back to the Methodist back to the Catholic no back to 1906 Azusa no back to the Pentecostal fathers [Applause] [Music] exactly so he turns the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal father so it would be back to the original message we know when it gets here it'll be a restoration to send that lukewarm latency in church back to that original Faith back Yonder again and this time he's to take the same Faith because they got away from the original Faith he's going to turn the faith of the fathers of the children back to the fathers the Pentecostal fathers another acts 2. that's right another one he promised Malachi 4 he would do this and manifest his word this is the token 1964. for those of you that dates matter what date did he say this in the day he date he was a prophet that's when as brother Aaron says he but Malachi before he would do and manifest his word to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers again back to the original Pentecostal word the real Bible word the Pentecostal they claim Pentecostal organization there's no such a thing as a Pentecostal organization Pentecost is an experience not an organization they tried to organize it but you can't see it doesn't organize Pentecost is an experience it's the Seal of God the holy spirit that come on the day of Pentecost want to stop here just a moment and share a thought with you just something I was just pondering on over just last night actually before I knew I'd be preaching today pondering this just a few days ago brother Branham says and he preaches this in cankerworm Palmer worm Locus caterpillar preaches it and I will restore saith the Lord he picks it back up in the token in The Invisible union he picks it back up all of these later messages brother Brandon preaches he's preaching the same thing all the way from the beginning to the end so anyone that wants to come and say oh that was back when him brother Brandon was Pentecost to him this is the word and the word only and though you can't this is not a Pentecostal message that was back when brother before the seals were open listen he tells those same stories says those same exact things all the way to what house will you build me 1965 leadership 1965. I was pondering this the other day brother Adam preaches this and I will restore and he says and this is Elementary so just stay right with me it's not complicated he shows how that the church Jesus said unless a corn of wheat goes dies and goes into the ground it abides The Loner brother random picks that scripture up in Matthew and says that was Jesus prophesying of the Gentile dispensation that would start in Ephesus through Paul and brother Branham says he Jesus knew that God would pour out an original experience on Pentecost and then that church in just a few short years would denominate and organize and fall away from that original word what is it that corn of wheat that seed goes into the ground and it dies and brother random says it was dead throughout the Dark Ages and then he comes to the end of the Ephesian churches and he says he says all that's left is a squalid village with just a few Believers signed Pentecost there's nowhere to be some of the some of the you read some of the things he said in Ephesian Church age then he says then God promised I will restore I'll restore it back through Luther what was Luther brother and it says he was a life messenger and he would restore some of the life that seed that went in the ground and died it would pop up in a stalk and brother Brandon says that stalk was Luther's message and he preached the just shall live by faith but it wasn't listen the seed was the original Church Luther was the stalk he wasn't the original church but it was the beginning or the framework brother Brandon would call it to restore that Original Seed and so brother random says Luther was the stalk and he says brother Adam says that that church that died at Pentecost would be restored through three life Messengers and so he calls Luther a life messenger he restores justification and he types him as the stop then he talks about Wesley and he says John Wesley's message of sanctification why did he have to preach sanctification because the church when John Wesley comes on the scene they've lived under Luther but brother random says what God what would happen he says God would send the message there would be a Revival that struck the heart of people then that messenger would die and the people would denominate and organize around his teaching and they would die the life was was gone so Wesley comes along and brother Brandon calls him the tassel and he uses the wheat plant another place he calls him just a blade and so here's more restoration and so Luther come joestly comes on the scene and while everyone's claiming justification and they're living Justified they're also living like the world and so Wesley preaches sanctification remember the man says what was that it was another life messenger death messenger had took it out of the church God sends a life Messenger to restore a little bit back and then he says then the third life messenger was 1906 Azusa Street to a bunch of unlearned people God shows up in a little corner somewhere on a street that no one had even paid any attention to as we preached not some great big steeple with brick buildings and big oh you know white steeple on the top and people in the nicest cars and people best dressed the celebrities know brother random says he passed all of those people by and he shows up in a little dingy building with hardly any lights in the building but he says those people were crying out and Desperation for the Holy Ghost and for the power of the book of Acts and brother Branham says and God pours out his Spirit on that little humble group of people and he says that was the third life messenger that's restored back 1906 he calls that Pentecost that then denominates that same Azusa Street Experience just as every other age they denominated they rose up organizations they they became Church of God they became UPC Pentecostal they became they gave them all kinds of names became denominational shut the doors to brother Branham kicked him out of their churches I said oh brother man if you'll just change this and change that take your tapes back and you know you need to call those tapes back in and you need to you need to you need to you need to bring them back and change this brother and it says I'm not calling my tapes back in he says if you think that was something I'm going to preach you harder on the next tape I'm going to preach it more straight on the next tape what was it he wasn't going to compromise by celebrities or popularity or what the mass installed huh and so so brother Brandon preaches and he preaches this life messenger was Pentecost the shock was the shock in that shuck brother Brandon says if you if you look at it and you look at the berries that are on that he says they look so close to the grain the grain The Original Seed and he says they looked so close to the real I've been with Farmers out in the field he says and he says any of you weep no any of you farmers who ever plant wheat know that that looks so much like the real Luther didn't look like the real he preached part of it but he smoked a pipe believed in three gods Wesley looked like it no Wesley didn't look like it Wesley was a life messenger but brother Brandon says but Penny calls 1906 with signs and wonders and miracles and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost looked so much like the real I thought this is what I was studying on last night he says it looks so much like the real and then he quotes Matthew 24. that it will be so close it would be like your left hand and right hand he says in another place that it would deceive the elected of God if it were possible amen he calls the Pentecostal Church the final stage which was the shock and then he preaches the seed shall not be heir with the shock and so he says that but that grain though it looked just like it yet inside of there when it opened up there was the real grain and the shock pulls away and shuts the door and brother Brandon says now what do you have at the top of the head you have exactly what went in the ground the original God of Pentecost back in a church again but let me just stop here and get you to think about something with me the shuck pulls away at the point the life leaves the shuck that's when Pentecost denominates and it moves into the wheat the bride elected the literal Life of Christ the reflecting brother random says she would reflect that seed that went in the ground but almost every time brother Branham almost every time he uses this example even in 1965 in leadership he references Matthew 24 24 that it would be that the true would be so close to the false are you with me that it could deceive the very elected if it was possible he quotes Matthew 24 24 being so close my point is is that if the True Church the true church the bride Church the elected Church of God of the last day yeah looks identical to the Pentecostal shock hello I'm not preaching something new this is exactly what brother random taught that that Pentecostal Church would look so much like the real that went in the ground yet it wasn't so the true church will also look like the real but it will be the real that's why he says Pentecost Pentecost is the standard he says there's no other standard that's why he says Pentecost is the pattern there is no other pattern that's why he says the original church at Pentecost with Mark 16 in action come on message believers is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false all else is false do you realize that the true church and the false Church which is not the Baptist Church it's not the intellectual dry dead church I'm talking about the Pentecostal charismatic church that had signs and wonders and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost do you know that brother Branham says that the true church and the false church will look so similar I know I got you thinking and that's a good thing listen to what brother Brandon says here in this next line if you're choking it's made by May uh may help you out sardesian Church age brother Noah he will all be the same and act the same church we'll have the same same word and have the same power and if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at Pentacles by experience it will be a penny costal Church my only point is this I'm going to make it quite simple the look-alike the twin doesn't look like the Baptist Church it doesn't look like dry dead theology solo scriptura it doesn't look like it doesn't look like dry intellectual theological seminars that's not who you're that's not who the twin is that's what brother random said the one that looked so close that would deceive the very elected is a church that you turn on the television you watch their shows they're shouting they're dancing they're there's Miracles there's miraculous they believe in the power of God they believe in the spirit of God then I just ask one question if that's who our look-alike is then shouldn't we at least look like that I know it's very simple and should be mind-blowing to us if this is our look-alike and yet we don't even look like the falls God help us you say brother Matt what are you preaching here this morning this is what I'm preaching to you no you're about to go on an exercise of scripture and so just be ready new guy so if someone wants to go back there and help him I want to read some of these listen to what it says in Acts 3 brother Noah Acts 3 verse one pull up the the scriptures getting if you could fast listen to what the book of Acts if we know that the true church will be like the first church can I get an amen on that the true church will look like the first church but we just read it brother Brandon says she'll be exactly like she was maybe I didn't get to finish that quote and he says he says if the church is the true church it will have the very same word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost by experience it will be a Pentecostal Church there will be tongues and interpretation and prophecy and healing God will be in the midst of her and God would declare himself in the midst of her as he always has Hallelujah and she will be unorganized don't forget that I'm reading you what brother Brandon says don't forget that she will have listen she'll be so much like the first church brother random even says Paul the first messenger the last messenger would be just like Paul and so the first Messengers Church would look like the last Messengers Church you say What's the difference between Pentecostal charismatics false and the true the only difference is that one rejects the word for their hour and one accepts it one of them compromise on the word of God and one of them won't compromise on the word of God we're not compromisers that's not Who We Are listen to what it says in Acts 3. I want to give you some of these this is Matthew 10 you don't have to give me that let me read you Matthew 10 1. and he called us to him he called to him his 12 disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal every disease and every Affliction this is the power or the commission that Jesus commissions the first church with this is the authority it was a transfer of the power of Jesus to the believer not on Jesus but now I'm the believer not on just a prophet but not on your lips on your faith on your flesh in your home in your family the same power transferred to the family of God listen to what Acts 3 say what are some Dimensions if we're to be like the first church the book of Acts Church let's read about them Acts 3 verse 1. now Peter and John went up together in the temple at The Hour of Prayer be I'm going to read fast so read with me because I got a lot at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid who laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms of them to enter the temple who's seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple astronomes and Peter fasting in his eyes upon him with John said look on us and he gave heed unto them in other words he paid attention to what they said expecting expecting do you realize you get what you expect you're sitting there with your arms crossed looking like a sour pickle you're gonna get a sour pickle that's what you're gonna get but those that have hands up that are saying Amen to the word of God your in expectation you're saying let that God of Pentecost come down on me let him inhabit the Praises of his people let him live in my lips and in my body and through my mind and through my heart and through my through my flesh and every part of me he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones receive strength acts 5 verse 1 but a certain man named ananias with Sapphira his wife sword of possession kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it brought a certain part and later the apostles feet but Peter said an ananias why is Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost do you know Satan can fill your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost I'll say that again Satan can fill your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost this is what Peter says and to keep back part of the pressure land while it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not in thine own power why is thou conceiving this thing in thy heart that was not light unto men hold on Peter she just told a lie to you so you mean that now Peter and John were representing the Holy Ghost and when they lied to their Pastor they were lying to the Holy Ghost it's a sobering thought that was not light unto men but unto God verse 5. well he says in an iris hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost died and great fear Came Upon all of them that heard these things verse 12 and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were Solomon's porch and of the rest Durst no man join himself to them but the people magnified them so the rest of the people the rest of the people all of those on the outside didn't want anything to do with that little church on Mossy Oaks Road they didn't want anything to do with it stay away from that cult stay away from those people but the people magnified them and God did Miracles and signs and that he says go to the next verse and he says and Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women do you know who we want added to this Church Believers not doubters not questioners not compromisers not people that want to change it I want a church full of Believers because I need a faith an atmosphere of faith and it can only come when the church is in one heart and one Accord and everyone believes the word and he says and Believers were added unto them and so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them there came also a multitude out of the city's roundabout Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every one if you needed a latte you went down to the big mega church but if you need delivered of a disease and an evil spirit you went to the book of Acts church if you needed a feel-good Vibe for that Sunday morning you went down to the mega church but if you needed the power oh do I have somebody here they could say I don't need a feel-good I don't need a good vibe I need the power of God preached an adulterated word of God to come and be spoken to my life oh how many would say that's what I want that's what I'm going looking for that's what I'm Desiring in my life I want the spirit of God Hallelujah ax listen to this this is we're in Acts 5. notice this in Acts chapter 8. verse 14. now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria received the word of God they're sending them Peter and John who they were to come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was falling upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost acts 9 verse 33 and there he found a certain man named manias which had kept the bed which it which had kept his bed eight years and was sick of the palsy and Peter said unto them anes Jesus Christ maketh thee whole arise and make thy bed and he arose immediately verse 36 now there was a japa a certain disciple named Tabitha which by interpretation is called Dorcas this woman was full of good works and all armed Deeds which she did and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber for as much as Lydia was night to Joplin the disciples had heard that Peter was there they said unto him two men Desiring him that he would not delay to come to them then Peter arose and went with him when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the window all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which dork has made while she was with them they were weeping memorizing this is this woman we love so much but Peter put them all forth and kneel down and prayed and turning him to the body said Tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat up and gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the Saints and widows presented her alive this is what we believe this is what we preach Resurrection to the dead life to the dead freedom to the addicted freedom to the depressed I say God pour it out in this church pour out that resurrection power in my life pour out a Revival where the Deads are there that have been given up on yet God pours the spirit and you might have gave up on them but God raises them up to life Hallelujah acts 12 and behold the angel Lord came over and a light shine in this prison and he smoked Peter on the side this is acts 12 verse 7 and raised him up saying to rise up quickly and his change fell off of his hands the angel said unto him gird thyselfs and bind on my sandals and so he did and he said unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me and he went out and followed him and knew not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision in other words it was real when they were past the first and the second ward they came unto the Iron Gate that leadeth unto the city which opened of which opened to them of his own accord hold on a minute did we just read that right you mean bars and doors that man had shut God can open I said doors and bars and Gates that the devil has shut and they haven't opened God says I'll open them in your life you might have given up on them and said it'll never open but God said I'm going to open those doors that have been shut in your life Hallelujah and they went out and passed on through one Street and forth with the angel departed from him notice this and when Peter was come to himself he said now I know of a shorty that the Lord had sent his Angel and that delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark or many were gathered together praying and as Peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to hearken named Rhoda acts 13 Verse 6 but elements the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation withstood them seeking to turn them away and he said seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith then Saul who is also called Paul filled with the Holy Ghost that's an important thing what made Saul Paul he was filled with the Holy Ghost set his eyes on him and said oh for all full of septility and all Mischief thou shout of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord and now behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the Sun for a season and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness and he went about seeing sin and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand you see there's blessings that come with this church and there's cursing that comes to this church that's why we say the most dangerous spot you can be in it's a church that is preaching the full unadulterated word of God it's the most dangerous place you can be in because when we speak it and you hear it you are now held accountable for what you have heard and it's not my words if I had my words it wouldn't mean nothing not a hill of beans but when I speak the word of God that's been Vindicated then it's on your laps what you do with it I say God help us to have a ten of hearts acts 16 let's keep going and it came to pass verse 16 acts 16 16. no I'm sorry I missed one acts 14 14 verse 8 acts 14 verse 8. there's had a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a from its mother's womb who had never walked the same heard Paul speak who steadfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had Faith to be healed said with a loud voice why do we use a loud voice because they did in the Bible so I'm using a loud voice you know sometimes you got to speak loud enough for the devil to hear you sometimes you got to say Amen I'm not loud enough for your doubt to hear you for that fear to hear you speak over those voices of fear speak over that doubt one time it'll shut the devil up in your life and he cried out with a loud voice stand up right on my feet and he leaped and walked and he leave him being a the same hurt Paul speak he said save with the loud voice stand upright upon the feet notice acts 16 verse 16 now and it came to pass as he went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with the spirit of divination met us which brought her Masters much gained by sooth saying the same followed Paul and us and cried saying these men are the Servants of the most high God which show unto us the way of Salvation and this did she many days but Paul be in grieved turned aside and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out that same hour expert and had the same chapter verse 25. and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them you know what when you sing the prisoners ought to hear you sing I said when you sing the prisoners ought to hear you sing because when the prisoners hear you sing those prisoners might get to go free the Bible says he praised God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone not just Paul not just Silas but everyone that was bound everyone that was diseased everyone that had spirits of evil everyone that was afflicted everyone that was in Chains you see when the people of God can get free Enough To Worship in the spirit of God and not care about what everybody thinks prisoners can go free addicted can drop can throw off their chains I say God let me get free enough so that all the prisoners can go free in our church oh let me get so free let me get so full of praise and worship that not a devil can stay in this building but we run him out of the windows and run him out of the door and freedom can go to Every Chain and every disease and every burden and every heart and every every disease of sickness every demon of depression every disease and a demon of Affliction and anxiety won't stand a chance in the presence of God if the church can get free how many would say I want that kind of a church Acts 19 verse 1 then said Paul John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands on them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied verse 11 Acts 19 and God wrote special miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought into the sick handkerchiefs and aprons and the diseases departed from from them and the evil spirit went out of them it should be our expectation I said it should be our expectation do you know that that Marcus Humphrey the man who was healed of stage four Hodgkin's lymphoma I mean I won't have time he'll have to give the testimony do you know that that's the second time cancer has been healed supernaturally in the life of brother Travis also prayed for a little boy that was diseased with cancer went to his grandpa's house the boy was in a bed giving up on was gonna die and brother Travis took a prayer cloth of brother Branham or one that we had prayed over yeah a prayer cloth of God's Prophet laid it on that boy went to that job sometime later that boy was supernaturally healed of cancer you say brother Matt what does that mean it should be our expectation this should be the Church of Pentecost this should be the church with signs and wonders this should be our expectation not a dead drive just teaching just some kind of some kind of lifestyle that we have of long hair and dresses oh thank God for it but there ought to be a life there ought to be a spirit that backs up that lifestyle there ought to be a power that backs up your preaching there ought to be a power that backs up your family and your prayers ought to be heard by God I say God give us a power like they had in the book of Acts to where we speak and God listens to where we petition and God sets us free this is the Church of Pentecost Acts chapter 20. verse 9 I'm going to close don't get scared and they're sat in the way a window a certain young man and uticus being fallen into a deep sleep and as Paul was long my goodness brother Matt it's 112. Paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third Loft and was taken up dead and Paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said trouble not yourself for his life is in him when he therefore has come up again and he had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while when God raises you from the dead long while and long sermons and long preaching don't bother you a bit yeah even till the break of day and they brought the young men alive and we're not a little comforted listen to what it says that that simply means it wasn't just a little Comfort they were greatly comforted acts 28 just two more I think two more acts 28 verse 3 and when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the Heat and fastened on his hand and when The Barbarians saw the venomous Beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he had escaped the sea yet Vengeance suffereth not to live this is what they actually thought of him yeah the guy escaped that shipwreck but now the Viper's biting him he must be a devil and he shook off the Beast I love how simple it was and he shook it off you know when people criticize you shake it off don't buy don't don't don't get weighted down with that and try to argue just shake it off into the fire when that Devil comes by then you just shake him off you ain't nothing devil I'm just gonna shake you off a little bit of Doubt comes in my heart I'm just gonna shake you off I'm not going to pay no attention to you and he says he shook him off into the fire and felt no horror how be it they looked when he should have swollen or Fallen dead down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said he was a god they weren't wrong he wasn't God but he was a messiah with God's power flowing through his veins acts 28 verse said look look at verse 7 same chapter in the same last one in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island whose name was publish I think that's how I'm saying that correctly who received us and lodged us three days courteously and it came to pass that the father lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux to whom Paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him oh hold on a minute you mean Paul didn't just walk up to him and say you ought you should just accept it and believe it brother God said just believe it just accept it even Paul didn't just walk in and go uh-huh yeah amen amen you mean Paul did something physically he used his physical hands to lay hands upon him you mean it might have to start in the flesh before God will do anything for you sometimes your brother and said you've got to go through the ax if you're not willing to go through the acts you'll never get to the spirit and he laid his hands upon him Paul and her prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him so when this was done others also which had diseases in the island came and were healed when the spirit of God came this is what it looked like in the book of Acts Church and brother Branham says that false church that Pentecostal church and 1906 the Azusa Street that had had organized and denominated because they rejected the word and brother Brandon says those doors you've closed to me you won't even have me preach oh brother random change this and change that and then he comes to that comes to that same exact message and says oh but I'm so glad they might have turned me down but I'm so glad for these churches these these little few churches that have opened their doors to me and for your young Pastor here who's caught the inspiration what was it it was more than just a teaching or a Doctrine or an understanding or theology he had caught the inspiration of Elijah he had caught the inspiration of the message that this as they said in the book of Acts Peter said this is that Peter said this is that that job prophesied about that I will restore saith the Lord and your young men shall dream dreams and your your young men shall see vision and your old men shall dream dreams I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh what was that Spirit he was pouring out it wasn't the denominational Spirit it wasn't a spirit of Education it wasn't a spirit of intellect it wasn't just Doctrine it was a supernatural anointing it was a supernatural spirit that dwelt on Elijah and I say God let me be a recipient of a double portion of the same spirit that fell at the book of Acts well how many would stand to their feet and raise their hand and say Lord let me be a recipient of that double portion let it live in me let it breathe through me let it think through me let my thoughts be its thoughts Let My Words Be its words oh God I raised my hands this morning and I say God give me a church as your Prophet said give me a church that's every move it's thus saith the Lord and I say and I Echo those words and there's a group of people here that'll raise hands and Echo those words give me a church that every move is thus saith the Lord and I'll show you a messiah upon the Earth give me a church that's so full of the power of God and so full of the spirit of God there wouldn't be a sick person in this building there wouldn't be a disease in this building that couldn't stand to be here give me the power of God so strong Lord that would care that would every demon Spirit would flee every lion devil would every every every every lying voice would be silenced every lion tongue would be silenced oh God I wonder if you would raise your hand and say that today hands up all over the building give me that Lord Jesus give me that Lord give me that give our church that all friends that your head bowed every eye closed I'm just going to say what the inspiration of the Holy Spirit has upon my heart you can just play something Softly every voice and every spirit is trying to shut this up and every every demon spirit and evil spirit is doing everything he can to silence our voices to shut our mouths to cause us to sit down every kind of evil spirit trying to get us to backslide and trying to get us to compromise do you know why do you know why people don't want this kind of preaching because it was prophesied they would come into the spirit of the last days and in the spirit of the last days it said they would Heap unto themselves this is the scripture they would Heap unto themselves teachers having itching ears there would be a generation of people that Paul would speak of and say for the time will come when they won't endure sound Doctrine they don't want that preaching they won't want them they won't they won't want that kind no they won't want that kind that's what brother random speaks of an invisible Union they don't he says they don't want any of them tongue talking that's not the kind of children they want they don't want them miserable wretches that they call them their Church would put them out if they had them they don't want anything to do with that Pentecostal message they want to modernize it and paint it up and dress it up and re-culture it and redefine it because it was prophesied for the time will come when they won't endure sound Doctrine but having itching ears they'll Heap unto themselves teachers [Music] teachers that they'll Heap after their own lusts this is going to be the heart of the the people prophesy unto us smooth things this is what Isaiah said in Isaiah chapter 30. they say which say to the seers and the prophets don't see prophesy not Prophet prophesying to us right things speaking to us smooth things prophesying to us deceits do you know this was a prophecy of this age 2022 there's a spirit that is moving on religious people it's in denominational churches and sadly to say it's in message churches it's upon make-believers and unbelievers a spirit that will doesn't like this kind of preaching wants to shut it up prophesy tell us good things tell us smooth things don't talk about those kind of things but let me give you your commission this is what the lord gave me let me give you your commission Paul said I charge thee before God in other words I command thee and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing in his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and Doctrine preach the word this is our commission don't don't turn aside don't compromise preach it preach it brothers and let me tell you there's a group of people who are saying preach it preach it to me give me that word of God give me that truth that's the only thing that will set me free oh do we have a church that would raise a hand and say God I want the unadulterated word of God I don't want to compromise I don't want it watered down if it hurts my feelings if it tears me to pieces if it breaks me down if it rebukes me chastises me then I'm going to
