[49:13] um
[49:14] i i want to by the help of the lord
[49:17] today
[49:18] continue
[49:19] uh in my
[49:21] study and in my series that i've been
[49:24] covering
[49:25] on the seven vials of revelation it's
[49:29] been exceptionally rewarding to me i
[49:31] trust it has
[49:32] for you as well i've just
[49:35] enjoyed it immensely it's hard to um
[49:38] hard to even you know decide how much i
[49:40] enjoyed it has just meant a massive
[49:43] amount to me
[49:44] and i trust it has to you
[49:47] um brother
[49:49] josh go ahead and put my you have my
[49:51] scripture go ahead and put that up
[49:53] and we we will start to look today and
[49:55] we're gonna we're gonna take another
[49:57] step
[49:58] um
[49:59] we've been through four now i just want
[50:01] to say before i get going
[50:03] that
[50:04] you know there's even going to be some
[50:06] things today that that you might hear me
[50:08] repeat and i'm doing it for emphasis
[50:10] because this is the critical
[50:13] material that i think we need to look at
[50:15] and we need to realize and be aware
[50:18] of the day and hour that we live in do
[50:20] you believe that
[50:22] and so you know god gives us his word
[50:24] for a reason it's not it's not an
[50:26] accident and so he gives us his word for
[50:30] reason all right so from 2nd
[50:32] thessalonians we're going to read
[50:35] a couple of a number of verses there let
[50:37] me turn to it myself
[50:38] so second thessalonians you have it say
[50:41] man it's on the screen if you don't have
[50:42] it
[50:43] but
[50:44] now we beseech you brethren by the
[50:46] coming of our lord jesus now i want you
[50:48] to pay close attention
[50:50] we beseech you brethren by the coming of
[50:53] our lord jesus christ and by our
[50:55] gathering together unto him
[50:58] that you be not soon shaken in mind or
[51:01] be troubled neither by spirit nor by
[51:05] word nor by letter as from us
[51:08] as that the day of christ is at hand
[51:12] verse 3
[51:14] let no man deceive you by any means for
[51:17] that day shall not come except there
[51:19] come a falling away first and that man
[51:22] of sin be revealed the son of perdition
[51:28] who opposeth and exalteth himself above
[51:31] all that is called god
[51:33] or that is worshipped so that he as god
[51:36] sitteth in the temple of god
[51:38] showing himself that he is god that's an
[51:42] amazing accomplishment
[51:45] we're talking about the devil
[51:46] this is what he has managed to pull off
[51:49] remember you not that when i was yet
[51:52] with you i told you these things
[51:55] and and now you know what withholdeth
[51:58] that he might be revealed in his time so
[52:02] now we're coming down to the end time
[52:03] verse seven for the mystery of iniquity
[52:06] doth already works it was already moving
[52:08] in the early church
[52:10] only he who now letteth
[52:12] will let
[52:13] uh and brother branham talks about now
[52:16] this is christ in the bride only he who
[52:20] now letteth will let until he
[52:23] christ and the bride be taken out of the
[52:26] way she goes in a rapture all right
[52:28] verse 8
[52:29] and then
[52:30] shall that wicked be revealed whom the
[52:33] lord shall consume with the spirit of
[52:36] his mouth and shall destroy with the
[52:38] brightness of his coming
[52:41] even him whose coming is after the
[52:43] working of satan with all power and
[52:46] signs and lying wonders we've talked
[52:49] about the working of devils and with all
[52:51] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[52:54] them that perish because they receive
[52:57] not the love of the truth that they
[53:00] might be saved
[53:01] um i think i'm gonna did i say through
[53:03] verse 12 josh do you remember okay verse
[53:05] 11 and for this cause god shall send
[53:08] them strong delusion that they should
[53:11] believe a lie
[53:12] and and that they all might be damned
[53:16] who believed not the truth but had
[53:18] pleasure in unrighteousness
[53:21] amen let's
[53:23] let's pray
[53:25] father we love you today
[53:28] we thank you for your great grace lord
[53:31] in our lives and we are
[53:33] trusting you now lord for all things
[53:37] master come to your word now and break
[53:39] the bread of life to us i have lord so
[53:42] much on my heart that i want to say
[53:45] but i more than that i want to say only
[53:47] what you want to say
[53:49] so now may you grant it to me lord and
[53:51] give us that portion of the word that we
[53:54] have need of so desperately today bless
[53:56] all of our visitors in the gate lord may
[53:59] they enjoy your presence with us we
[54:02] commit it to you in jesus name amen god
[54:04] bless you friends you can be seated
[54:13] so i you know i
[54:16] there's some things that
[54:18] we we have said and
[54:20] we'll say again and because as i as i've
[54:23] indicated
[54:24] they are so vital to the day and hour
[54:27] that we live in i believe friends that
[54:29] we must
[54:30] see christ in all of his movements
[54:32] you must stay up on it you must
[54:35] understand what he's doing because what
[54:38] he's every time he takes a step he's
[54:41] moving toward a conclusion and he's
[54:44] moving toward perfection and so we we
[54:47] realize that everything that he's doing
[54:49] is vital and and you know when you were
[54:53] following moses in the wilderness
[54:56] you were the instructions if you were
[54:58] part of the tribes of israel was that
[55:00] you stay close
[55:02] that you stay within earshot of the
[55:04] trumpet because when it came time to
[55:08] move no one knew when it was time no one
[55:11] until the pillar of fire started moving
[55:13] or the cloud started moving and then it
[55:15] was blow a trumpet quickly assemble
[55:18] everybody pack up we're moving he's on
[55:20] the move we got to go now that
[55:22] that was that was already um
[55:25] you know um
[55:27] that was already urgent enough
[55:30] but then if you were outside of earshot
[55:34] if you didn't hear the trumpet
[55:36] and you you didn't you weren't concerned
[55:38] enough
[55:39] to stay close to the ministry and close
[55:43] to where the word was going forth and
[55:45] and it became um you know not so
[55:48] important to you and you allowed your
[55:50] life to move in a haphazard way where
[55:54] excuse me where you would where you
[55:56] would
[55:58] not recognize what you say i recognize
[56:01] my day and its message but but we have
[56:03] to always watch where the i am is and
[56:07] he's always going forward and so he he's
[56:11] come in many forms as we said moses saw
[56:13] him as a as a burning bush he's they saw
[56:16] him as a cloud by day they saw him as a
[56:19] fire by night we find that sometimes he
[56:21] appeared as an angel talking to gideon
[56:24] or talking to the parents of samson he
[56:26] appeared to joshua as a soldier he
[56:29] appeared to abraham as a king
[56:31] see from uh from a city whose builder
[56:33] and maker was god he was the king of
[56:35] salem and so he appeared uh to to israel
[56:40] as a man see he appeared in the upper
[56:42] room as licks of fire and when those
[56:45] licks of fire came into the people now
[56:48] the i am was in them
[56:50] see and so we're always watching he
[56:53] would he would send a messenger in each
[56:55] age and now that's where the i am was
[56:58] because it's never i was or i will be
[57:00] it's always i am
[57:02] right now
[57:04] and so wherever the i am is
[57:07] there is where grace and mercy exist
[57:11] there is no grace and mercy in the i was
[57:15] see and and and you you don't sit back
[57:18] and wait on i will be because you'll as
[57:20] brother jack duff says you're never
[57:23] going to hear the words come up if you
[57:26] don't first hear the words come out amen
[57:30] come out of her my people
[57:33] so you can hear come up higher amen amen
[57:38] so we we were looking and i i want to
[57:41] i want to make just a quick correction i
[57:44] was i was trying to see where i finished
[57:47] up last sunday uh and and i had to do
[57:50] that it's hard as it is on me i can't
[57:52] stand to watch myself ministering on
[57:53] video but i i had to do that because i'm
[57:56] i'm also covering this material on the
[57:58] daily uh internet radio show kind of a
[58:01] thing that we do brother tim and i are
[58:03] on that together teaching and uh and so
[58:06] sometimes i can't remember did i say
[58:07] that on the on the broadcast or did i
[58:10] say that in my pulpit and it's all
[58:12] running together at this point and so
[58:14] i'm trying not to have too much
[58:16] duplicity but one thing i i wanted to
[58:19] clear up is i i heard myself talking
[58:21] about we were talking about zechariah 14
[58:24] and we showed you the destruction of
[58:27] things that were going on that are going
[58:29] to happen in the tribulation period and
[58:31] remember the earth is split open again
[58:33] jerusalem is divided into three parts
[58:36] the mount of olives comes up uh uh is
[58:39] split right there
[58:42] and so so we find that that then
[58:45] afterwards it talks about when is that
[58:47] going to happen it says in the day
[58:50] when it won't be day or night it'd be
[58:52] like a dismal day you can't call it day
[58:54] or night but at the evening time it
[58:56] shall be light now i was using that to
[58:59] indicate to you that that that's another
[59:02] sign among the many that we've shown you
[59:05] and why on the authority of prophecy and
[59:07] the authority of brother branham and his
[59:09] message over and over again we can
[59:11] effectively say that all of the trumpets
[59:14] and vials and seals and they've all been
[59:17] playing in history and but when we come
[59:20] to the end time we find after the bride
[59:23] goes home then those seven vials pour
[59:26] out in their fullness
[59:27] but you you don't want to
[59:30] lose sight of the fact that they're
[59:32] having a partial influence on the earth
[59:34] now
[59:37] but i but i but and i've taught it that
[59:39] way very clearly
[59:40] but at the same time i found myself
[59:43] saying to you
[59:45] to the effect of we see that these these
[59:48] plagues are falling before the rapture
[59:51] and what i meant was that partially
[59:55] we're feeling the effects of it it's not
[59:57] in the fullness until the bride is gone
[1:00:02] amen
[1:00:05] amen and then i
[1:00:07] i think i heard myself
[1:00:09] excuse me my voice will get good in a
[1:00:11] minute here i'll blow through
[1:00:12] it i think i ended up referring to a
[1:00:15] sorority and calling it a fraternity i
[1:00:17] didn't mean to do that it's one's what
[1:00:19] guy's doing one's what we were talking
[1:00:21] about the bride of christ remember that
[1:00:23] we talked about the the the things that
[1:00:25] she went through and you know sometimes
[1:00:27] as an infant bride she barely could walk
[1:00:30] even when a prophet went home you know
[1:00:32] she she was still she was still barely a
[1:00:34] toddler she's an infant when when the
[1:00:36] seals are are being opened and and then
[1:00:39] we talked about going into the 70s and
[1:00:42] all the different camps you know because
[1:00:43] now she's grown a little more but then
[1:00:45] we go into the 70s and got all the
[1:00:47] different splits all different camps and
[1:00:49] all different nonsense and i said well
[1:00:50] that's what junior high school girls do
[1:00:53] they divide and split and have clicks
[1:00:55] and and and you know and and then you
[1:00:57] then when they even when they grow up
[1:00:58] and go to college then you know they're
[1:01:00] in this sorority or that sorority and
[1:01:02] this one against that one and your
[1:01:04] mascot against my mascot but the point
[1:01:06] we were making is
[1:01:08] the bride is done with that and she's
[1:01:10] not interested in kingdom building of
[1:01:12] men
[1:01:13] she's not interested in super
[1:01:15] sensationalism of of men's ideas now we
[1:01:19] are very much for the power of the
[1:01:20] living god
[1:01:22] and i believe it ought to it ought to be
[1:01:24] a it ought to be a fire breathing
[1:01:26] experience in our lives that produces a
[1:01:28] fire-breathing life
[1:01:31] amen
[1:01:32] and so but we but we don't chase
[1:01:35] sensations as a as a prime target
[1:01:38] we realize that signs follow the bride
[1:01:41] she doesn't chase after them
[1:01:43] so we were talking about that we don't
[1:01:45] chase after super things like that
[1:01:47] brother branham taught us better than
[1:01:49] that
[1:01:49] and so we find now when we when we start
[1:01:52] breaking into our into our quotes and
[1:01:56] today
[1:01:57] uh we're moving from in the seven vials
[1:02:00] of revelation and uh i wonder how that
[1:02:03] got up there already
[1:02:05] let's see are we okay there's why it was
[1:02:07] starting right there the seven vials of
[1:02:10] revelation and then
[1:02:12] based on my text that i read
[1:02:14] here is where we're covering today the
[1:02:17] restraining powers and it's and i've
[1:02:20] said a little bit about it and i
[1:02:21] remember saying things about it here and
[1:02:23] on the air and uh but i wanna i wanna
[1:02:26] really zero in on it a little bit today
[1:02:28] and i'm hoping i can get through all
[1:02:29] this and not uh run myself out of time
[1:02:32] so i'm gonna try to go studiously and
[1:02:33] you just stay with me don't drift or
[1:02:36] you'll get lost in the shuffle and i
[1:02:37] don't have time to recover you so
[1:02:40] so we come here now and now remember
[1:02:43] remember this is brother brennan's
[1:02:45] series where he's came home from
[1:02:47] jeffersonville
[1:02:48] and he's gonna his burden on his heart
[1:02:50] is the is to teach on the vials he wants
[1:02:53] a school he wants a building where he
[1:02:54] can break it down like the seals uh he
[1:02:57] wanted to do that with the trumpets as
[1:02:59] well it wasn't it wasn't given to him
[1:03:00] the lord wouldn't allow it that way so
[1:03:03] but he what he does do is take eight or
[1:03:05] nine services and he preaches on things
[1:03:08] that are relevant to you and me in our
[1:03:10] daily lives that the that the influence
[1:03:14] of the seventh vial is trying to hinder
[1:03:18] and so you remember it was released into
[1:03:20] the air and that's exactly what brother
[1:03:21] branham we read it to you last week
[1:03:23] where he said you know he threw a rock
[1:03:25] up in the air and and he says the
[1:03:28] judgments now have begun they're here
[1:03:30] they're now they're already started and
[1:03:31] they'll lead all the way to the end all
[1:03:33] right so so so this is why when we're
[1:03:37] looking at these quotes
[1:03:39] we've already well established this is
[1:03:42] part five if you've missed any of the
[1:03:43] others go back and get them we've
[1:03:45] already established the symbolism we've
[1:03:48] already we've already correlated it with
[1:03:50] history we've already showed you the
[1:03:52] connection between seals trumpets and
[1:03:54] vials and woes so so what i want to
[1:03:58] really make this more about from here on
[1:04:01] is what is the impact on our lives if
[1:04:04] this seventh vial is now influencing the
[1:04:06] world then what do i need to be on my
[1:04:09] guard for
[1:04:11] right
[1:04:13] so brother branham says here this is the
[1:04:14] second sermon uh or the first if you
[1:04:17] count it as i count it as ashamed being
[1:04:20] the first you you could you could say
[1:04:22] ashamed was where he announces it that's
[1:04:23] fine but we had a lot of good quotes and
[1:04:26] ashamed also
[1:04:27] so he says here
[1:04:30] he says now don't this is where we ended
[1:04:32] last time don't take something new
[1:04:35] they're flying everywhere and there'll
[1:04:37] be more than that come but don't take
[1:04:41] new things
[1:04:44] the lord your god
[1:04:46] has declared to you what is truth now
[1:04:50] here's a point we've made
[1:04:52] i'm pretty sure i made it to you and i
[1:04:54] want to emphasize it a little stronger
[1:04:56] today
[1:04:57] that we're at a time now that jesus
[1:05:00] prophesied the day is coming and he says
[1:05:03] it there at the well the day is coming
[1:05:04] and now is but it's also coming when
[1:05:08] they that worship him must worship it
[1:05:10] won't matter jerusalem or samaria uh but
[1:05:13] you're gonna have to worship him in
[1:05:15] spirit and truth
[1:05:16] and your your location isn't gonna mean
[1:05:19] a lot to you if you if you if you don't
[1:05:22] accept the word in its in its fullness
[1:05:26] in the immediacy of the time you live in
[1:05:28] and that was his message to that woman
[1:05:30] she said we know messiah is coming
[1:05:33] he first had to get her to understand
[1:05:35] he's not coming
[1:05:37] he's here
[1:05:39] i am he
[1:05:42] we know when messiah cometh he'll tell
[1:05:44] us these things jesus said i'm i'm the
[1:05:46] one i'm the messiah
[1:05:49] and so it's it's a changing of
[1:05:51] dispensation where
[1:05:55] excuse me i am so sorry
[1:05:57] where sixteen hundred years
[1:05:59] of new of old testament law and
[1:06:02] sacrifice was about to be
[1:06:04] was about to be swept aside
[1:06:07] so swept aside
[1:06:09] that it not only wouldn't do you any
[1:06:11] good
[1:06:13] but it would actually hold you back
[1:06:16] from going forward see
[1:06:18] and this is what paul was constantly
[1:06:21] over the jews because they were always
[1:06:23] trying to go back and hold on to
[1:06:24] circumcision and hold on to this and
[1:06:26] hold on to that and paul said if you
[1:06:28] hold on to those things you're
[1:06:29] you're you're making the cross of no
[1:06:31] effect
[1:06:32] see
[1:06:33] it does you no good because
[1:06:36] the dispensation is moving that god that
[1:06:39] dwelt over israel is now trying to dwell
[1:06:43] inside of a people
[1:06:47] and that is coming again
[1:06:50] at the end time that's a prophecy
[1:06:53] all right so he says so now there's a
[1:06:56] lot to be said about spirit and truth
[1:07:00] and that's where we are today and that's
[1:07:02] why we call it
[1:07:03] that's exactly why
[1:07:05] we call it a message of the hour amen
[1:07:11] you see it's people say what is the
[1:07:13] message of the hour my answer is just
[1:07:16] god keeping his word
[1:07:18] it's not a new it's not something
[1:07:20] different it's not another gospel
[1:07:23] it's just that prophecy told us
[1:07:25] that the true gospel once the apostles
[1:07:28] died would be lost
[1:07:30] that's in the bible it's all through the
[1:07:32] bible and then it actually describes the
[1:07:34] ages and you can go back and overlay
[1:07:36] history and see it hit right on the
[1:07:37] money
[1:07:38] they fell away and went into the dark
[1:07:40] dark ages but he said i will restore it
[1:07:43] in stages and he did amen
[1:07:46] and i'll i'll i'll raise up and and
[1:07:48] there's and that's why in the book of
[1:07:50] revelation there's such an emphasis on
[1:07:52] those last three angels to the church
[1:07:54] ages because there through lutheran
[1:07:56] wesley and elijah
[1:07:58] that we believe to be william branham
[1:08:00] he's going to bring back the full
[1:08:02] restoration of the bride tree
[1:08:04] with fruit
[1:08:05] in the top of the tree and the sun
[1:08:07] shining on it ripening it see
[1:08:10] so so we got no time to be school
[1:08:13] children anymore
[1:08:15] we got no time for kingdom building
[1:08:17] anymore we got no time for this camp or
[1:08:19] that camp and we got no time for
[1:08:21] carnality and being indulging in the
[1:08:23] world it's going home time
[1:08:26] amen
[1:08:29] so
[1:08:30] we have arrived at the hour
[1:08:33] of the return of spirit and truth so
[1:08:36] that we could worship god
[1:08:38] in spirit and truth and it is only the
[1:08:41] gospel that brings that and that's what
[1:08:44] the message of this hour is is a
[1:08:46] restoration of that gospel
[1:08:51] it's not something different
[1:08:53] so he says the lord your god has
[1:08:55] declared to you what truth is
[1:08:58] the lord your god has vindicated boy and
[1:09:00] how what truth is
[1:09:02] by his word and by his spirit and i'm
[1:09:04] not just talking about the
[1:09:07] inexplicable miracles in the tens of
[1:09:10] thousands that went on around the world
[1:09:13] over 33 years of ministry
[1:09:15] so much so that you you would if you
[1:09:18] combined all of the supernatural of all
[1:09:20] of the faith healers of brother
[1:09:21] branham's era all of his peers
[1:09:24] if you combined all the supernatural of
[1:09:26] their ministry it would hardly fill a
[1:09:28] thimble compared
[1:09:29] to the supernatural that occurred on a
[1:09:31] daily basis in the ministry of william
[1:09:33] brother but all that aside
[1:09:35] all that aside our our faith in this
[1:09:38] word
[1:09:39] is not about that our faith in this word
[1:09:41] that we know it's the time of spirit and
[1:09:43] truth is is that it has called us out of
[1:09:46] the world and separated us and filled us
[1:09:48] with a burning desire
[1:09:51] to be like christ to be like the word
[1:09:53] and we look at the world systems and we
[1:09:56] don't want that
[1:09:58] amen
[1:09:59] see
[1:10:01] because the prophecies tell us that
[1:10:04] people at the end time
[1:10:06] well heap to themselves teachers with
[1:10:08] itching ears
[1:10:09] you're going i can tell you friends this
[1:10:12] is why the new birth is so important
[1:10:13] because you're going to believe the
[1:10:15] gospel that you're going to believe the
[1:10:17] version that there's a lot of versions
[1:10:19] of the gospel
[1:10:20] there's only one true gospel
[1:10:23] you're going to believe and follow the
[1:10:26] version that you want to be true
[1:10:32] and if you want a gospel
[1:10:34] that allows you to live carnal in the
[1:10:36] world and still claim to be a christian
[1:10:38] i promise you there's a gospel for you
[1:10:41] it's not the original one
[1:10:43] it's another jesus not the one paul
[1:10:45] priest paul said i'm afraid you're going
[1:10:47] to have another jesus and it won't be
[1:10:49] the one i preached to you to be a
[1:10:50] different one see
[1:10:52] and so this is why you have to have a
[1:10:54] nature change or all you'll do is
[1:10:57] because people are going to believe what
[1:10:59] they want to hear that's how con men
[1:11:01] work they tell people what they want to
[1:11:03] hear and people who believe it and
[1:11:04] people who want who want the gospel they
[1:11:07] want it to be true that i can just live
[1:11:09] any old way and it doesn't matter and
[1:11:12] satan will make sure that you get a
[1:11:14] gospel
[1:11:15] called that
[1:11:18] but this is the hour of spirit and truth
[1:11:20] that's turning men and women
[1:11:23] into the image of jesus christ in the
[1:11:25] last days
[1:11:29] so believe a watered-down version to
[1:11:31] your own demise believe it at your own
[1:11:33] peril
[1:11:34] see
[1:11:37] you know i i'll just say it plain if you
[1:11:40] follow a watered-down version of this
[1:11:42] message you're going to go to hell
[1:11:45] you hear it hear it on the internet
[1:11:47] whoever might be listening you're
[1:11:48] absolutely going to miss a rapture and
[1:11:50] you're very likely going to end up in a
[1:11:52] lake of fire
[1:11:54] because what it what how how you gonna
[1:11:56] miss it if you spurn the grace and the
[1:11:58] mercy that's in the word for this hour
[1:12:02] see
[1:12:03] i promise you your good works won't save
[1:12:05] you
[1:12:08] they're done in iniquity
[1:12:10] see
[1:12:13] i get that there's good people who don't
[1:12:15] know it but if you look at those people
[1:12:17] those are sanctified they call them the
[1:12:18] bible calls them saints
[1:12:20] it means sanctified
[1:12:21] means they're righteous they have a
[1:12:23] righteousness uh in their works and the
[1:12:25] king recognizes that and calls them
[1:12:26] righteous and calls them saints see but
[1:12:29] don't don't that's that's the remnant of
[1:12:31] the woman's seat don't try to attach
[1:12:33] that to the tommy rod out here that we
[1:12:35] see in excuses for christianity that
[1:12:38] that's that's the kind of stuff that's
[1:12:40] going to put you in the line of atomic
[1:12:42] fodder for a nuclear age
[1:12:44] all right so
[1:12:46] we have no apology for that all right
[1:12:49] and it's time to say it plain
[1:12:52] say why do you say it to a church full
[1:12:53] of believers because i know what
[1:12:55] especially i know what our young people
[1:12:57] are hearing out there
[1:12:58] and there's a group whispering in their
[1:13:00] ear telling them it's okay you don't
[1:13:02] have to be all that intense you know we
[1:13:04] we have a different version of the
[1:13:05] message there ain't no different version
[1:13:08] there's only an eternal version and it's
[1:13:10] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:13] see
[1:13:15] so thank god for the mercy and the grace
[1:13:18] of god amen
[1:13:19] and and so he goes on to say
[1:13:22] boy just use a quarter of my time and
[1:13:24] have harley got going
[1:13:27] so he says here let's go on so the lord
[1:13:30] your god has declared to you what truth
[1:13:32] is the lord your god has vindicated what
[1:13:34] truth is by his word and by his spirit
[1:13:36] not by power not by might but by my
[1:13:39] spirit and the spirit god seeks those
[1:13:41] who worship him in spirit
[1:13:44] uh and and uh let me catch it here see
[1:13:47] in spirit and truth thy word is truth
[1:13:50] and he has thoroughly vindicated that
[1:13:52] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:13:54] and forever he has shown the evening
[1:13:57] seats to you he has revealed it to you
[1:13:59] in the word he has proven it to you by
[1:14:02] his spirit so he has shown it to you in
[1:14:04] the word
[1:14:05] and you have become privy to the most
[1:14:08] wonderful truths
[1:14:10] that the world you're guaranteed to hear
[1:14:12] things that you'll never hear in the
[1:14:14] average sunday morning pulpit anywhere
[1:14:16] in the world
[1:14:17] but he's not only given it to you in the
[1:14:19] word he's actually vindicated it in your
[1:14:21] life by his spirit anointing that word
[1:14:25] in your life
[1:14:28] see
[1:14:29] so so he he has proven it to you
[1:14:32] by his spirit
[1:14:35] now brother branham goes on here now
[1:14:36] watch all right let me let me let me
[1:14:38] before i go to that i want to make a an
[1:14:40] entry a an entry statement an
[1:14:43] introduction to this next quote
[1:14:46] i've said it
[1:14:47] i said it minutes ago
[1:14:49] and i want to really make sure your
[1:14:51] attention is focused
[1:14:54] because i've said to you
[1:14:56] that
[1:14:57] the reason for brother branham preaching
[1:14:59] these
[1:15:01] vile series though he doesn't call him
[1:15:03] that
[1:15:04] is to show us
[1:15:06] what the devil is trying to do
[1:15:10] so now whatever we read on here
[1:15:13] is to counter
[1:15:14] what he's trying to do
[1:15:17] so you then be will be able to deduce
[1:15:20] by what you read
[1:15:22] what he's up to
[1:15:24] and you've got a prophet about to warn
[1:15:26] you don't fall for it
[1:15:29] all right
[1:15:30] now here's one of the
[1:15:32] here's a here's a
[1:15:34] here is a remedy here is a medicine here
[1:15:37] is an antidote here is a vaccine against
[1:15:40] the the this airborne
[1:15:43] uh infection that the seventh seal
[1:15:45] released into the air it's causing
[1:15:48] people
[1:15:48] to do a certain thing and it's bringing
[1:15:51] disruptions in homes disruptions in
[1:15:54] churches disruptions in marriages
[1:15:57] churches split marriages split homes
[1:15:59] split teenagers split i mean
[1:16:02] it's terrible and satan is always trying
[1:16:04] to divide
[1:16:05] you know you don't don't forget this
[1:16:07] young people listen young people god
[1:16:09] bless you you know you who are single
[1:16:12] just remember brother jason said this
[1:16:15] that
[1:16:16] that sometimes if you're found in a
[1:16:18] situation and as your young men and
[1:16:21] young women your mom and dad can't
[1:16:22] always be watching and they they
[1:16:24] shouldn't need to see and so
[1:16:27] you've got to be able to stand on your
[1:16:29] own two feet after a certain age but
[1:16:31] just remember you can get caught in a
[1:16:33] certain situation
[1:16:34] and satan will try to tempt you into
[1:16:37] doing things that are contrary to god's
[1:16:38] word boy with a girl girl with a boy you
[1:16:41] follow what i'm saying
[1:16:42] i just want you to remember
[1:16:45] that the very same devil the very same
[1:16:48] one
[1:16:49] the very same demon that is trying to
[1:16:52] drive you together before marriage in a
[1:16:54] way that shouldn't happen
[1:16:56] will be the exact same demon who tries
[1:16:59] to drive you apart after you're married
[1:17:03] don't you forget it it's exact same
[1:17:06] demon all right
[1:17:07] so he says here now watch he says here
[1:17:09] we go here's a you ready for an antidote
[1:17:12] to the madness of the world
[1:17:15] brother branham says live humble
[1:17:20] that is so important say that's pretty
[1:17:22] simple he put it in his seven vial
[1:17:24] series
[1:17:26] that's how important it is he put that
[1:17:28] in his seven vial series the burden of
[1:17:30] his heart is the seven vials and he says
[1:17:33] this is the second message live humble
[1:17:36] live loving
[1:17:38] love one another
[1:17:40] don't never get nothing among you if you
[1:17:43] see something coming up in your heart
[1:17:45] against somebody get it out of there
[1:17:47] right then
[1:17:48] don't let and satan will do his best to
[1:17:52] get among you see
[1:17:53] don't let that happen
[1:17:57] we don't want no malice we don't want no
[1:17:59] strife we want god and he is the word
[1:18:04] see
[1:18:06] this this assembly and other different
[1:18:08] assemblies are growing this needs to be
[1:18:10] remembered constantly
[1:18:12] satan won't just try he'll try his best
[1:18:17] i mean he's coming with the with the
[1:18:18] with the full package see now so brother
[1:18:21] branham goes on watch
[1:18:23] and now he's in a prayer here's what we
[1:18:25] desire all right
[1:18:27] i think you'll agree with this heal the
[1:18:29] sick and the afflicted lord we pray
[1:18:33] may there not be a feeble person in our
[1:18:35] midst because of your presence lord now
[1:18:38] how many want his presence
[1:18:40] may our hearts continually be set on
[1:18:43] thee
[1:18:44] and we know lord that money property
[1:18:47] things of the world i read this last
[1:18:49] time have no meanings
[1:18:51] just so temporal all of them must go
[1:18:56] see
[1:18:57] this is this is seven vial medicine
[1:19:01] this is your antidote to the to the
[1:19:04] plague that's released into the air and
[1:19:07] is affecting the whole world and all of
[1:19:09] your surroundings yes see
[1:19:12] every every
[1:19:14] everything you do your job is being
[1:19:16] affected by the vials
[1:19:19] your places of recreation don't forget
[1:19:22] your fashions
[1:19:24] your entertainments please don't forget
[1:19:27] there's a there's an infection in the
[1:19:29] air
[1:19:31] and it's poisoning everything you
[1:19:33] contact in this world say i can't go out
[1:19:36] of the world no you can't go out of the
[1:19:37] world but you've got to be an overcomer
[1:19:40] of these things
[1:19:41] see
[1:19:42] and you'll never overcome it having
[1:19:44] doubt in the word
[1:19:48] see
[1:19:49] they all must go
[1:19:52] brother branham goes on our jobs
[1:19:55] our places
[1:19:56] our friends
[1:19:58] everything must go no matter how rich
[1:20:00] how poor
[1:20:01] how popular isn't this amazing this is
[1:20:04] seventh vile
[1:20:06] antidote
[1:20:07] see it's to counter what's happening no
[1:20:10] matter how popular or unpopular we are
[1:20:12] it all must go
[1:20:13] but there is only one thing that our
[1:20:16] being here is centered around and that's
[1:20:19] jesus christ
[1:20:21] so god
[1:20:22] let us lay aside you noticing how many
[1:20:26] times like paul is using the word let
[1:20:29] like paul said lay aside brother branham
[1:20:31] says let us lay aside brother branham
[1:20:33] says the devil will try his best don't
[1:20:35] you let that happen
[1:20:37] let the mind which was in christ be in
[1:20:40] you see
[1:20:42] so he says there's only one thing
[1:20:45] that our being here is centered around
[1:20:46] and that's jesus christ so god let us
[1:20:49] lay aside everything as secondarily and
[1:20:53] hold to him and he is the word do you
[1:20:57] believe
[1:20:58] that see so we have
[1:21:02] we have come
[1:21:03] to the woes i think this one darkens you
[1:21:07] so we have come then to the woes and the
[1:21:09] seals and the trumpets and the vials and
[1:21:12] we found out from our quotes that
[1:21:14] they're all happening in a cluster and
[1:21:16] that's what people are missing
[1:21:18] and and and they all have their partial
[1:21:21] work on this side of the tribulation
[1:21:23] we've demonstrated that in history
[1:21:25] brother branham tied it very directly on
[1:21:27] tape to to historical events
[1:21:30] and and and but they we realize then
[1:21:32] that they continue on until we reach
[1:21:35] fullness in the tribulation when the
[1:21:36] bride is gone and so you've got a cup of
[1:21:39] iniquity that we talked about being full
[1:21:41] as it relates at least i'm i'm sure the
[1:21:44] world can get much more evil before we
[1:21:46] get out of here but as far as
[1:21:47] denominations are concerned organized
[1:21:49] religion that cup of iniquity is done
[1:21:51] god's already it doesn't matter build as
[1:21:54] many denominations as you want he don't
[1:21:56] regard them you don't have anything to
[1:21:57] do with them he's not in them
[1:21:59] see people go in there and read they
[1:22:02] carry your their same bible in there
[1:22:04] sing the same songs but god is finished
[1:22:06] completely done with organized religion
[1:22:10] see that cup of iniquity that ship has
[1:22:12] sailed all right so we find then that
[1:22:15] that that that it's time now for the
[1:22:18] word and the word alone so the sin
[1:22:22] and the perversion this is because of
[1:22:24] this plague released in the air
[1:22:27] this is what's causing the sin and the
[1:22:29] perversion in the minds of humanity and
[1:22:31] there's some natural things causing it
[1:22:33] too going to connect quite a bit to
[1:22:35] matthew sunday school here in just a few
[1:22:36] minutes something brother branham said
[1:22:39] he says now so so we're finding that
[1:22:41] that wants these things and and this is
[1:22:43] this is an important point now let me
[1:22:45] just
[1:22:46] let me just
[1:22:47] crystallize all right
[1:22:49] once these things began
[1:22:52] to unfold and they did they have already
[1:22:56] then then then humanity as i said last
[1:22:59] time would would need to reevaluate its
[1:23:02] future
[1:23:03] the woes
[1:23:04] when the woes began the first whoa of
[1:23:07] world war one
[1:23:09] you you find that the woes were actually
[1:23:12] uh uh they were uh
[1:23:14] they were actually a harbinger of doom
[1:23:17] unrecognized by the world
[1:23:19] see now i'm not of course i'm not
[1:23:21] talking about you know the awfulness of
[1:23:23] world war but i'm talking about a
[1:23:25] sequence of events
[1:23:27] that had begun
[1:23:29] uh
[1:23:30] you know as we start to look at prophecy
[1:23:32] you have this sequence of events uh you
[1:23:35] know
[1:23:36] that had begun to to herald what what we
[1:23:39] would call you know uh an end of time
[1:23:42] sequence
[1:23:44] uh there's a sequence an end of time
[1:23:46] sequence
[1:23:47] and you find that that got started it
[1:23:49] started approaching under the fourth
[1:23:50] trumpet historically
[1:23:52] and then by the time you get to the
[1:23:54] fifth trumpet and we've talked about
[1:23:55] this
[1:23:56] there's where satan was cast down and a
[1:23:58] bottomless pit was opened
[1:24:01] and brother branham points back to that
[1:24:02] now and says the lid is torn from hell
[1:24:05] and demon powers are streaming into the
[1:24:07] earth that's been going on for a long
[1:24:09] time
[1:24:10] see and we've we found out that that
[1:24:13] that's why he ra
[1:24:14] started the azusa revival and all and
[1:24:17] both of those that fifth trumpet and
[1:24:19] that is who's a revival to because when
[1:24:20] uh when the enemy raises comes in like a
[1:24:23] flood god raises a standard
[1:24:25] but we find that that that when when all
[1:24:28] of that is happening you know and the
[1:24:30] and that's right before world war one
[1:24:33] that's right before world war one see
[1:24:36] and you you have to you have to know how
[1:24:37] to connect all the dots between
[1:24:39] revelation 9 and revelation 7 and
[1:24:41] different things like that and you've
[1:24:42] got these angels standing on the four
[1:24:44] winds and uh and though and the walls
[1:24:46] are now coming and we realize that that
[1:24:49] that that in plain language you know the
[1:24:52] wall the first wall was the beginning
[1:24:55] of an extinction event that we
[1:24:58] call armageddon
[1:25:02] and it would have just carried on the
[1:25:03] first wall would have went to the second
[1:25:04] would have went to the third and would
[1:25:06] have annihilated all living things from
[1:25:08] the surface of the earth
[1:25:10] but but god has an angel rising out of
[1:25:13] the east with the seal of god of course
[1:25:15] it's christ he's the only one who can
[1:25:17] give you the seal he rises out of the
[1:25:18] east having the seal of the living god
[1:25:20] and he puts a a pause because he's got
[1:25:23] children down in there but but
[1:25:26] eventually the second woe is going to
[1:25:28] come and eventually the bride's going to
[1:25:29] leave and moses and elijah are going to
[1:25:31] go forward and they're going to kill
[1:25:34] them and they're going to lay in the
[1:25:36] streets of jerusalem dead and we find
[1:25:39] that the bible says now that marks the
[1:25:41] end of the second woe and behold the
[1:25:44] third woe cometh quickly
[1:25:50] so so so this global event that would
[1:25:53] sweep mankind and all living things
[1:25:56] from the face of the earth you know
[1:25:58] where what what remained
[1:26:01] of humanity's future was now very very
[1:26:05] short because now we've had the day star
[1:26:07] we've had the light of another day
[1:26:09] there's another day coming
[1:26:11] that's why it's so dark there's another
[1:26:13] day pressing on the darkness
[1:26:16] see that's why the earth is
[1:26:18] transitioning they want to they want to
[1:26:20] blame whatever fossil fuel
[1:26:23] you know for global warming i don't know
[1:26:24] what's causing global warming i just
[1:26:26] know the earth is transitioning
[1:26:29] all nature's groaning because it knows
[1:26:31] its day of release is coming
[1:26:34] hallelujah nature's already
[1:26:37] transitioning it's going to melt off
[1:26:39] those places that's melting the polar
[1:26:40] caps it ain't going to need them
[1:26:43] it ain't going to need on the polar caps
[1:26:45] keep our temperatures from getting too
[1:26:47] hot we're not going to need that in the
[1:26:48] millennium the world's going to write
[1:26:50] itself and nature's going to be back in
[1:26:52] harmony again
[1:26:54] hallelujah and those ice fields will be
[1:26:57] tropical beautiful lush forest
[1:27:00] like they were before the ice fields
[1:27:02] were there
[1:27:04] not afraid of global warming let it come
[1:27:07] it's the earth changing i'm changing too
[1:27:10] hallelujah the earth's headed for a a
[1:27:12] rest day oh i've already got my rest day
[1:27:14] now i'm looking for that new body
[1:27:17] hallelujah
[1:27:19] so god wraps up
[1:27:22] you know a rapture cycle which is of
[1:27:24] course already underway
[1:27:26] and then the bride is taking a secret
[1:27:28] catching away and from that point
[1:27:30] humanity has 42 months and counting it's
[1:27:33] like a clock like a stopwatch and every
[1:27:35] day they get a little closer and there's
[1:27:37] not they they they can't they can't call
[1:27:39] time out
[1:27:41] once that happens
[1:27:42] see because because once god started
[1:27:45] dealing with israel in the end time
[1:27:47] sequence of events the clock started
[1:27:49] again because that's always been his
[1:27:50] timepiece see
[1:27:52] and so so we find then that that you
[1:27:55] know the earth has gone into this effect
[1:27:58] of the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:28:00] evil on society and we learned by
[1:28:02] prophecy that that evil would accelerate
[1:28:05] very quickly and you can look at at all
[1:28:07] kinds of data we could put it up here
[1:28:09] for you today
[1:28:11] showing you the the precipitous fall of
[1:28:13] of morals uh that happened right right
[1:28:16] at right right after right is that
[1:28:18] fourth and fifth trumpet are sounding
[1:28:21] and the sun is going dark and the moon
[1:28:23] won't shine and stars are falling and
[1:28:25] brother branham is identifying that as
[1:28:27] christ being rejected and the church
[1:28:29] going dark and sons of god are falling
[1:28:31] for it
[1:28:33] and since that time of the turn of the
[1:28:35] century and brother branham said we've
[1:28:37] spent millions and millions and millions
[1:28:39] and millions and millions of dollars and
[1:28:40] we've had programs all over the world
[1:28:42] but it's not getting better it's getting
[1:28:44] worse and now it's gotten much worse
[1:28:47] these things are not an accident friend
[1:28:49] you are the generation that are going to
[1:28:51] see the coming of the lord
[1:28:53] you're the generation upon the bible
[1:28:55] says upon whom the ends of the world
[1:28:57] have come
[1:28:59] hallelujah i'm so glad to be a part of
[1:29:01] that generation
[1:29:04] oh my
[1:29:07] and so the whole world as we said last
[1:29:10] time being led down the primrose path a
[1:29:12] primrose path
[1:29:13] is a is a phrase coined and it just
[1:29:16] means a path of ease but it really goes
[1:29:19] into a path of ease or a path of
[1:29:22] pleasure especially sensual pleasure
[1:29:25] and that's where the world has
[1:29:26] completely went off the deep end
[1:29:29] and it couldn't stop with just you know
[1:29:31] sensual pleasures it it finally got to
[1:29:34] the point where it was so twisted and
[1:29:36] now it is so twisted it defies
[1:29:39] it defies our imagination that it is
[1:29:41] what it is
[1:29:43] i mean you say people can't be that
[1:29:45] insane yet they are
[1:29:48] you know as we we talked about it last
[1:29:51] time an eight-year-old boy gets out of
[1:29:52] bed one day and says i think i'm a girl
[1:29:54] today
[1:29:57] and and you've got parents who support
[1:29:59] him
[1:30:00] in that
[1:30:01] you've got a social media who applaud
[1:30:03] him
[1:30:04] you've got a government who passed laws
[1:30:05] to protect him
[1:30:06] you've got courts who enforce things
[1:30:09] upon good people who take a stand
[1:30:11] against that stuff you think that's an
[1:30:13] accident that wasn't globally like that
[1:30:15] until this last day until this end time
[1:30:18] sequence of events begin to transpire
[1:30:21] let me tell you let me ask you a
[1:30:23] question once the the the end time
[1:30:25] events are bracketed in time they have a
[1:30:27] starting time and an ending time
[1:30:29] how much time do you think is in there
[1:30:31] between when they start and when it's
[1:30:33] over
[1:30:34] i'm here to tell you we've already came
[1:30:37] more than a hundred years since it got
[1:30:39] rolling before the first world war then
[1:30:41] brother branham talks about i know it
[1:30:43] could be another hundred years it's
[1:30:44] already been a hundred years since that
[1:30:46] time
[1:30:47] say we've already more than a half a
[1:30:48] century past the seals being open oh
[1:30:51] look up your redemption draweth nigh
[1:30:54] [Applause]
[1:30:56] there's a time for young people to be
[1:30:59] serious about their experience with god
[1:31:01] you're going to have to have that token
[1:31:03] you're going to have to have a personal
[1:31:04] experience with christ say i don't think
[1:31:06] i have that then ask him for it
[1:31:08] ask him for it i say jesus give me a
[1:31:11] personal experience with you
[1:31:15] because i i'm convinced by the preaching
[1:31:17] of the word that there's not much time
[1:31:19] left and i don't want to miss it lord i
[1:31:21] don't want to miss it
[1:31:22] hallelujah this is a time for parents to
[1:31:25] be on fire
[1:31:27] for parents to be zealous
[1:31:29] for parents to set the right kind of
[1:31:31] standards in the home amen
[1:31:37] oh my
[1:31:40] so now we've arrived at the breaking of
[1:31:42] these things
[1:31:44] and we've been emphasizing to you how
[1:31:45] that acceptance by god and any victory
[1:31:47] you hope to have in the holy spirit do
[1:31:49] you hope to have some
[1:31:51] amen
[1:31:53] it's all now
[1:31:55] being housed
[1:31:56] in true worship in spirit and truth
[1:32:01] and outside of that you're
[1:32:03] i mean you know this has broad
[1:32:04] applications
[1:32:06] even for grace and mercy which we're
[1:32:07] going to talk about just a little bit
[1:32:09] you know
[1:32:10] where is the mercy seat i'll tell you
[1:32:12] this much it's not a piece of furniture
[1:32:15] all right
[1:32:16] and uh there's the grace of god but who
[1:32:19] who has access to grace
[1:32:22] oh we were so blessed yesterday brother
[1:32:24] stan was here and and giving me a little
[1:32:27] bit of uh giving our little group we had
[1:32:30] a breakfast and then we were here in the
[1:32:32] in the main service uh time and then in
[1:32:34] the evening there brother brad's house
[1:32:36] and he was talking about this whole idea
[1:32:38] of grace and i i dove into that last
[1:32:41] night by the tim i found all of that
[1:32:42] material and it all checks out 100 and i
[1:32:46] i'm gonna get to it just in a minute but
[1:32:49] but we find out that you know the the
[1:32:51] bible talks about the grace of god hath
[1:32:54] appeared to all men
[1:32:56] because really friends
[1:32:59] it
[1:33:00] when it comes to the grace of god now
[1:33:02] we're not talking about it's the mercy
[1:33:03] of god say are they different well they
[1:33:05] are because brother branham said you can
[1:33:07] exhaust the mercy of god but you can't
[1:33:09] exhaust the grace of god
[1:33:10] as a child of god
[1:33:12] you can keep transgressing and keep
[1:33:14] transgressing and god will keep warning
[1:33:16] you and sending preachers to preach to
[1:33:18] you and convicting you and waking you up
[1:33:20] and telling you want to do that and
[1:33:22] finally you'll exhaust his mercy and
[1:33:24] he'll wear you out for it
[1:33:26] but but if you're a child of god if
[1:33:28] you've got a gene of god you can never
[1:33:29] exhaust his grace
[1:33:31] i can never make myself not a child of
[1:33:33] god because i came from god i go back to
[1:33:36] god
[1:33:37] so my my my pre my debt my predestined
[1:33:41] place is where i started
[1:33:43] it's not where am i going it's where did
[1:33:45] i begin see and there's where grace
[1:33:48] because when it comes to the grace of
[1:33:50] god you're going to find out that it's
[1:33:52] exclusive god has mercy on the whole
[1:33:54] world and offers and through his grace
[1:33:56] and mercy saves the sinner and and and
[1:33:59] brings people to salvation from
[1:34:01] destruction but the grace that is is is
[1:34:04] for redemption
[1:34:06] is only brother branham said only the
[1:34:08] predestinated are considered in
[1:34:10] redemption amen see
[1:34:13] and so you say but grace appears to all
[1:34:15] men of course it does now
[1:34:17] you know be careful because you'll trap
[1:34:19] yourself because it appears to all men
[1:34:21] and what is grace what does that grace
[1:34:22] do it teaches you to deny ungodliness
[1:34:26] that's the whole reason disgrace is a
[1:34:28] thing
[1:34:29] see because
[1:34:31] the whole reason there's grace and
[1:34:32] disgrace is that disgrace means you
[1:34:36] never have come under grace
[1:34:38] you've never been born again of the
[1:34:39] spirit of god and so when you live that
[1:34:42] way you say oh you're turning grace into
[1:34:44] disgrace no you're not you're a sinner
[1:34:46] you need you need the holy ghost you
[1:34:47] need to be born again
[1:34:49] see
[1:34:50] and so so when we look at these things
[1:34:52] we find our lives then
[1:34:54] through true worship
[1:34:56] you know in spirit and in truth in our
[1:34:58] lives that are transformed into the
[1:35:00] living word
[1:35:01] and so so that's why we have you know a
[1:35:04] major part of the mystery of the of the
[1:35:06] rapture is the word living behind skin
[1:35:08] the word living inside your flesh
[1:35:11] all right and we i remember saying to
[1:35:13] you one time previous that that this
[1:35:15] this being true then no wonder it calls
[1:35:19] for a total separation from unbelief
[1:35:23] that's the age and the hour that we live
[1:35:25] in see and and and and while grace
[1:35:29] is god you know grace appeared to all
[1:35:32] men
[1:35:33] but the bible teaches us in ephesians 4
[1:35:35] that grace is apportioned
[1:35:38] it's apportioned
[1:35:40] yeah it goes to all men but it's
[1:35:41] apportioned
[1:35:42] it's if you know god god has a has a
[1:35:45] family
[1:35:46] and that he's that he's here to find
[1:35:49] those names on the lamb's book of life
[1:35:51] and that's what that grace is for
[1:35:54] see
[1:35:55] and only when you're born again of the
[1:35:57] spirit of god by a gene of god
[1:35:59] then you're under that grace
[1:36:01] see all right i'm getting ahead of
[1:36:03] myself and i'm not going to give you a
[1:36:04] clear picture we'll get to in a minute i
[1:36:05] hope
[1:36:08] so
[1:36:09] so we let me come back to our quotes now
[1:36:11] so brother branham let me see where did
[1:36:13] i finish up here
[1:36:16] so we already looked at live at other
[1:36:18] times about how that um
[1:36:20] you know it's it's it's an advantage to
[1:36:22] you
[1:36:23] to be in a in a close relationship with
[1:36:26] god we talked about brother i'm told the
[1:36:28] story
[1:36:29] of the man who and his boy was dying
[1:36:31] and and the brothers they all gathered
[1:36:33] around to pray and god spared the little
[1:36:34] boy's life and brother bran talks about
[1:36:36] now look at what look what would have
[1:36:38] happened that boy was dying and doctors
[1:36:40] couldn't save him how big of an
[1:36:42] advantage was it that he had that kind
[1:36:44] of relationship with the lord
[1:36:46] and see this is why brother branham said
[1:36:47] there's things coming on the earth
[1:36:48] friends and this was a half century ago
[1:36:50] there's things coming on the earth why
[1:36:52] do you why do you preach perfect faith
[1:36:54] because you're going to need it
[1:36:57] see and perfect faith comes with
[1:36:59] fellowship and relation with christ
[1:37:02] it's all it's it's in it's embedded in
[1:37:04] relationships see and so that and to
[1:37:07] prove that i mean just think about the
[1:37:09] spouse that you love where does your
[1:37:10] confidence where's your faith in that
[1:37:12] spouse come from because of the level of
[1:37:14] relationship
[1:37:15] that's what did it see and so i i know
[1:37:18] that that if i can't trust a human in
[1:37:20] the world i can trust my wife
[1:37:23] if i couldn't trust anyone because i i
[1:37:25] have that kind of level of relationship
[1:37:27] i know she'll never leave me or forsake
[1:37:29] me that's how it is with christ when he
[1:37:31] says i'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:37:33] you and people sometimes can get in such
[1:37:36] a dark place because they say but he
[1:37:38] said he would never leave me nor forsake
[1:37:40] me but that's tied up in relationship
[1:37:43] see and and that that that's that's
[1:37:45] directly proportioned to that and you
[1:37:47] don't have much release of a
[1:37:49] relationship then you're not you're you
[1:37:51] don't you don't need to look for the
[1:37:53] peace that passes understanding it ain't
[1:37:54] it ain't coming your way
[1:37:56] you don't need to uh you know think well
[1:37:59] i you know i got something that's gonna
[1:38:00] drive fear out of me i got something
[1:38:02] listen friends it's all tied up in the
[1:38:04] relationship you have with the word
[1:38:11] and so so brother branham talks about
[1:38:14] there and i don't i didn't put it on the
[1:38:15] overhead
[1:38:16] you know god had his loyal servants
[1:38:18] there for brother blair and them to pray
[1:38:19] for the little boy when he was in that
[1:38:20] condition when anything happens remember
[1:38:23] remember when anything happens and you
[1:38:25] got that kind of relationship just
[1:38:26] remember you're a child of god
[1:38:29] you don't have to take that from the
[1:38:30] devil you're a child of god
[1:38:32] amen
[1:38:34] amen when when the devil attacked sister
[1:38:36] kathy she had really a little chance to
[1:38:38] live
[1:38:39] i mean the the things that was happening
[1:38:41] to our sister in rapid succession but
[1:38:43] brother jack wouldn't take it
[1:38:45] he refused to take it he would not
[1:38:47] accept it and he he he took jurisdiction
[1:38:50] over the enemy
[1:38:52] and took jurisdiction over those things
[1:38:54] and every every doctor kept saying it's
[1:38:56] bad it's bad until the last doctor said
[1:38:58] mister uh guess we can't find anything
[1:39:01] wrong with your wife come get her
[1:39:05] hallelujah
[1:39:06] [Applause]
[1:39:08] see
[1:39:10] and so when anything happens remember
[1:39:12] you're the children of god now this
[1:39:13] comes into
[1:39:15] uh restraint
[1:39:18] and i'm
[1:39:18] if i don't just do it the way i'm about
[1:39:20] to do it and i promise the lord i would
[1:39:23] i'd follow his lead i want to take you
[1:39:25] through and do it methodically but i
[1:39:28] i'm i'm feeling not urged to not do it
[1:39:30] that way i'm just going to give you the
[1:39:31] burden on my heart about it
[1:39:34] it's the theme of this sermon today
[1:39:37] that it's about contrast
[1:39:39] okay now
[1:39:40] let me just help you with contrast okay
[1:39:43] couple examples we could think of
[1:39:45] when
[1:39:47] when the children of israel
[1:39:50] were
[1:39:50] leaving in the exodus
[1:39:52] there was darkness throughout egypt but
[1:39:55] there was light in goshen
[1:39:58] when they went into the wilderness and
[1:39:59] they're fleeing
[1:40:01] and and and they got trapped in in the
[1:40:03] in the in the in the geography
[1:40:06] and that moses ran them into a boxed in
[1:40:08] area where they were they were trapped
[1:40:10] by the red sea and mountains on all
[1:40:12] sides in israel i mean and egypt thought
[1:40:14] we got them well good grief every
[1:40:16] military strategist would say that we
[1:40:18] got them now
[1:40:19] we're going to annihilate them we but
[1:40:21] but god came down in that pillar of fire
[1:40:24] and stood in the in the way
[1:40:26] and it was just the same god but on this
[1:40:29] side to the egyptians he looked like
[1:40:31] thick darkness and they were afraid
[1:40:34] on this side of it it was bright light
[1:40:36] shining light and the children of israel
[1:40:38] were comforted by that
[1:40:39] see and so so you're always going to
[1:40:41] have that contrast we've talked about
[1:40:43] the contrast of the tower of babel how
[1:40:45] that god comes in there and they're
[1:40:47] they're in one mind and one accord and
[1:40:49] god's going to actually use a trick that
[1:40:51] satan
[1:40:52] has used and that is to cause confusion
[1:40:54] and god takes away their common language
[1:40:57] and their common uh you know mind they
[1:41:00] had one mind they were in one mind they
[1:41:01] had one language and one speech meant
[1:41:03] one mind and one accord spoke the same
[1:41:05] language and god confused them and what
[1:41:07] did it do it scattered them see
[1:41:10] and so
[1:41:11] so then you see god bringing that exact
[1:41:14] thing in the upper room one mind and one
[1:41:16] accord and then satan seeing that and
[1:41:18] remembering that said okay i know how to
[1:41:20] handle that i'll just start bringing
[1:41:22] confusion among the people and so he
[1:41:25] brings confusion in your life he hits
[1:41:27] you with sickness he troubles your
[1:41:29] children he troubles your finances he
[1:41:31] does all he has problems in churches and
[1:41:33] problems in ministry and problems in
[1:41:35] marriages and what's what's he doing
[1:41:37] he's trying to counter god's effort to
[1:41:40] make you of one mind and one accord
[1:41:42] because in there all things are possible
[1:41:46] hallelujah so naturally he's going to
[1:41:48] try to hinder marriages naturally he's
[1:41:50] going to try to get at you through your
[1:41:52] kids naturally he's going to try to use
[1:41:54] preachers and use churches and and he's
[1:41:56] going to do everything he can because
[1:41:58] his is the contrast he's they're doing
[1:42:00] the same thing in opposite directions
[1:42:02] and it's all about the greatest battle
[1:42:05] ever fought in your mind it's control of
[1:42:08] the mind of man
[1:42:11] see
[1:42:13] and that's why you're going to need
[1:42:14] supreme thought control at the end time
[1:42:16] i don't mean psychology i mean you're
[1:42:18] going to have to have faith in the word
[1:42:20] of god
[1:42:21] and no matter what you see no matter
[1:42:23] what's happening you're going to control
[1:42:25] your mind you're going to say whatsoever
[1:42:27] things are good and what sort of things
[1:42:29] are lovely and whatsoever things are
[1:42:31] pure and whatsoever things are of a good
[1:42:33] report i'm going to think on these
[1:42:35] things what are you going to do with the
[1:42:37] bad i'm going to cast down vain
[1:42:38] imaginations i'm going to throw out
[1:42:40] anything that exalts itself against the
[1:42:42] word of god
[1:42:46] see
[1:42:49] so so we find it rolling in this way and
[1:42:52] and so brother branham says i think i
[1:42:54] have it right here
[1:42:56] where did i pick up
[1:43:00] all right i see that
[1:43:02] let me come to where i need to be i'm
[1:43:03] gonna
[1:43:04] i'm gonna lose my place and i'm not
[1:43:06] gonna get to this point the lord's
[1:43:07] drilling holes in me
[1:43:10] i want you to understand
[1:43:13] that
[1:43:14] he that letteth
[1:43:16] christ
[1:43:18] will let
[1:43:20] will hold
[1:43:21] will restrain
[1:43:23] the antichrist
[1:43:24] until he the holy ghost and the bride
[1:43:28] that's son of man ministry
[1:43:30] son of man ministry see
[1:43:32] some don't confuse son of
[1:43:34] man office that's a prophet
[1:43:38] but the the whole purpose of the holy
[1:43:39] ghost was to create a son of man
[1:43:41] ministry that's the word made flesh
[1:43:44] so god bookends it he sends a prophet in
[1:43:46] the alpha and that prophet gives them a
[1:43:49] word in spirit and truth and they become
[1:43:51] by the baptism of the holy ghost the
[1:43:52] word made flesh
[1:43:54] god does the same thing when he's
[1:43:55] restoring it he sends a prophet in the
[1:43:57] office of son of man
[1:43:58] and when that prophet gives us a message
[1:44:01] of the hour this is why you should never
[1:44:02] water it down
[1:44:04] he's bringing you the very thing to make
[1:44:06] you the living word
[1:44:09] the whole thing is not to make you a
[1:44:10] theologian and to fill up your computer
[1:44:13] you know with all kinds of uh memory
[1:44:15] verses and memory quotes and satan don't
[1:44:18] care how religious you are
[1:44:20] and he don't even care how right and
[1:44:22] correct and accurate you are in your
[1:44:24] teaching
[1:44:25] what he knows is is that if you miss the
[1:44:27] life you won't come up anyway
[1:44:30] don't get played by the devil come on
[1:44:33] young people don't get played by the
[1:44:35] devil don't fall for that nonsense
[1:44:37] god has sent the word of deliverance in
[1:44:40] this hour he sent a word that will bring
[1:44:42] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:44:45] i've had it happen friends i've had it
[1:44:46] happen on more than a few occasions just
[1:44:49] like in the book of acts uh while peter
[1:44:51] yet spake these words i've been
[1:44:53] preaching and not calling a prayer line
[1:44:55] not praying for anybody just while i was
[1:44:57] preaching young people jumping up filled
[1:45:00] with the holy ghost sinners coming in
[1:45:02] off the street hear a few words and fall
[1:45:04] down and repent people sicknesses
[1:45:06] deliverance depression oppression
[1:45:08] delivered in a moment
[1:45:10] wow he yet speak these words you can
[1:45:13] believe today that while the word is
[1:45:15] going forth it is able more than able
[1:45:19] it's anointed of the holy ghost and it's
[1:45:21] accurate by a prophet hallelujah we have
[1:45:24] the world the devil's answer
[1:45:27] hallelujah put your confidence in it put
[1:45:30] your whole heart in it give your whole
[1:45:32] life to it
[1:45:35] it'll get you home
[1:45:39] it'll put you on my front porch
[1:45:42] hey man
[1:45:44] you want to sit on my front porch and
[1:45:45] talk about
[1:45:46] they used to be
[1:45:48] chris
[1:45:49] uh we'll we'll sit someday on the other
[1:45:51] side and
[1:45:52] we'll we'll laugh and shake our heads at
[1:45:55] all the meanness that went on in there
[1:45:57] used to be
[1:45:59] oh hallelujah
[1:46:02] so
[1:46:03] so you have to understand god is using
[1:46:06] that
[1:46:08] to restrain the antichrist
[1:46:11] his life
[1:46:12] living through you
[1:46:15] puts the word in flesh and restrains the
[1:46:17] beast
[1:46:19] amen see
[1:46:21] but now we found out
[1:46:23] now that's what we read today but we
[1:46:25] found out also when we read the book of
[1:46:26] romans
[1:46:27] 1 18 i think
[1:46:29] that
[1:46:31] that we find that there are men in the
[1:46:33] world
[1:46:34] who
[1:46:35] hold the truth in unrighteousness
[1:46:37] which not the same word they resist they
[1:46:40] restrain
[1:46:42] they restrain the truth
[1:46:44] from being made manifest
[1:46:47] and you know how they do it
[1:46:48] by unrighteousness
[1:46:52] so now look at this contrast
[1:46:54] look at the restraint that's why i took
[1:46:56] a subtitle the restraining powers
[1:47:00] now you've got a power
[1:47:02] that is trying to live in you
[1:47:04] from god that restrains the devil and
[1:47:08] the devil
[1:47:09] trying to tease you and entice you into
[1:47:12] unrighteousness
[1:47:13] now is trying to use you to restrain god
[1:47:19] you're talking about a contrast and
[1:47:22] you're caught in the middle this is the
[1:47:24] greatest battle ever fought
[1:47:27] god trying to work through the bride to
[1:47:30] hold back satan and satan trying to work
[1:47:33] through that same bride to hold back the
[1:47:35] plan of god
[1:47:36] he can't defeat jesus he's already took
[1:47:38] a weapon every time he tries it he
[1:47:41] brother ram said he can't stop the word
[1:47:43] so what does he do he attacks the
[1:47:45] vessels who carry the word if he can
[1:47:47] fill up your life with carnality if he
[1:47:49] can fill up your life with nonsense of
[1:47:51] the world and laodicea and flu if he can
[1:47:54] infect you hallelujah friends then he
[1:47:56] can hold back the power of god from
[1:47:59] moving in your home and this ain't no
[1:48:00] time to have the power of god held back
[1:48:03] in your home there's a time to have a
[1:48:05] freedom of the holy spirit there's a
[1:48:07] time to have worship in the home and in
[1:48:09] the church and in your car and in the
[1:48:11] schools and everywhere we go this is a
[1:48:14] time of worship
[1:48:17] that's a time to operate in spirit and
[1:48:19] in truth
[1:48:21] for the hour has arrived for
[1:48:23] the day is coming and now is i'm here to
[1:48:26] tell you you're you're in a day that now
[1:48:29] is
[1:48:32] that's what satan doesn't want you to
[1:48:34] realize
[1:48:37] so he fills up your life
[1:48:39] and persuades you into unrighteousness
[1:48:42] and you're playing
[1:48:44] you're getting played
[1:48:47] young people you're getting played
[1:48:50] if you go along with him you're getting
[1:48:51] played
[1:48:52] he's trying to use
[1:48:54] you
[1:48:56] the bride of christ
[1:48:58] to hold back
[1:49:00] the power of god
[1:49:02] he can't take on god directly
[1:49:05] see
[1:49:06] the serpent couldn't come to adam
[1:49:08] directly
[1:49:09] adam would have put him in his place
[1:49:10] immediately
[1:49:12] so he come to his helpmate
[1:49:15] so he can't come to christ he's already
[1:49:17] lost he can't go to the word he's
[1:49:19] already defeated
[1:49:21] so what does he do
[1:49:22] he comes to the vessels that carry it
[1:49:26] satan knows that you are destined
[1:49:29] to inherit the throne amen
[1:49:34] says that important it is for this
[1:49:36] reason
[1:49:38] that's the very place he wants to be
[1:49:41] he said i will ascend i will be like the
[1:49:45] most high god i will sit
[1:49:48] like god
[1:49:50] i will be worshipped
[1:49:51] like god
[1:49:53] don't give him your life friends
[1:49:55] young people don't give him your life
[1:49:57] don't give in to that married couples
[1:49:59] don't don't give way to those things
[1:50:02] bethel tabernacle every church that's
[1:50:04] out there stay humble
[1:50:06] stay in love
[1:50:08] don't let satan's to try his best to
[1:50:09] come in don't let that happen
[1:50:12] hallelujah how many say today i'm going
[1:50:14] to take a stand for the word of god i'll
[1:50:17] stand for it and let the world go by
[1:50:19] i'll stand for jesus

[1:50:23] i'll take the way with the lord's

[1:50:42] than a hundred years
