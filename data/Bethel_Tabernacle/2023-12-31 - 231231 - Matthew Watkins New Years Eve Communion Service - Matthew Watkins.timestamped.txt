[13:40] Andrew softly if you
[13:50] [Music]
[13:53] could
[13:55] tonight hear this wonderful message from
[13:58] from the lips of our brother we believe
[14:00] to be anointed of the Holy Spirit to
[14:03] bring us these great Tidings of as the
[14:06] set of exhortation how we should live in
[14:09] this present day and Holiness before God
[14:12] and before one another we we want this
[14:15] Holiness Among Us that no filthy
[14:18] Communications be heard Among Us at all
[14:20] as we profess this great calling of God
[14:24] we must walk worthy of this thing that
[14:26] God has brought us to and we're waiting
[14:28] down towards the end of the journey now
[14:30] where we're expecting exceeding
[14:32] abundantly above all that we do and
[14:35] remember we want to constantly be in
[14:37] prayer Above All Things watch your life
[14:40] if your life don't tally up with God's
[14:43] holiness then go back and start praying
[14:45] again there's something wrong see we
[14:47] must live in that kind of a state that
[14:50] the fruits of the spirit will make
[14:51] itself known through it that's what we
[14:53] want to live you know sometime we you're
[14:56] great preachers who can preach mighty
[14:59] but we'd rather see a sermon live than
[15:01] we would heard one
[15:02] preach that's the evidence that God is
[15:04] on the inside now we are having coming
[15:08] to the communion table and now uh
[15:11] there's some that doesn't take communion
[15:13] and maybe they just take it in their own
[15:15] churches but we'd be happy tonight if
[15:18] you could want to fellowship with us
[15:21] around these things we never draw any
[15:23] lines of who as long as you're walking
[15:27] worthy uh of the gospel that you're
[15:30] you're listening to and confessing to be
[15:32] part of you know you're part of this
[15:35] gospel amen you are you are written
[15:38] Epistles of what we're talking about and
[15:40] as long as we do something that's
[15:42] reproachful then we are an indent to
[15:44] what we're listening to we must live
[15:47] what we believe and live it in such a
[15:50] way that it will never reproach but
[15:52] reflect Jesus Christ in all things that
[15:54] we do and say that's the way it is we
[15:57] just love him for this and now tonight
[15:59] we're going to read the order of the
[16:01] Lord's table that's found over in 2
[16:04] Corinthians about the 11th chapter and
[16:07] we read this and just like each
[16:09] individual how we do this if there's
[16:11] newcomers among us we call the people
[16:13] around the altar in in succession as
[16:16] they come in take the communion and
[16:18] every Christian is
[16:21] worthy now if you live a life that
[16:23] proves what you are you want to search
[16:26] your heart or let me be sure to
[16:28] mentioned it that the scripture reads
[16:30] here if we take it
[16:33] unworthily now we know that we are not
[16:36] worthy in ourselves none of God Amen but
[16:39] that we are not trusting in our own
[16:41] worthiness we're trusting in Him who has
[16:44] we're trusting in his worthy amen that
[16:47] we have died to our own thinking and
[16:49] just think his thoughts and live that
[16:52] everything that we believe he commands
[16:54] us to and look back and see what we're
[16:56] living look our life over and if we're
[16:58] doing things that's not worthy of the
[17:00] Gospel then we shouldn't take the
[17:02] communion but if we're doing things that
[17:04] we think that it that our lives could be
[17:07] read of all man that if anybody could
[17:09] not point a finger and say I seen this
[17:11] man in a barroom the other day I I heard
[17:14] this man standing telling filthy jokes
[17:17] this woman doing wrong then if you know
[17:20] that that's the Holy Spirit pointing to
[17:22] you that then don't take the communion
[17:25] but if you if you feel that that you're
[17:27] living at look back and see all your
[17:30] sins are confessed in another Blood then
[17:33] you you're supposed to take it you're
[17:35] part of it now let us read the scripture
[17:37] just as St Paul exorts us here in the
[17:41] book of St John the I figure Parton in
[17:44] book of 1 Corinthians the U the 11th
[17:48] chapter beginning with the 23rd verse
[17:51] for I have received of the Lord which
[17:55] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[17:58] Jesus the same night which is betrayed
[18:01] took
[18:02] bread wish I had time to to speak that a
[18:06] little bit the same night that he was
[18:08] betrayed you see he took
[18:11] bread and when he had give thanks he
[18:14] break it said Take and Eat This is my
[18:16] body which is broken for you this do in
[18:19] remembrance of me after the same manner
[18:23] also he took the cup and when he took
[18:25] saying this cup is of the new test
[18:29] in my blood this do ye as off as you
[18:33] drink it in remembrance of me for as off
[18:36] as you as you eat this bread and drink
[18:39] this cup you do show forth the Lord's
[18:42] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[18:47] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[18:49] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[18:53] of the body and the blood of the
[18:56] Lord but let a man EXA Exon himself and
[19:00] so let him eat of the bread and drink of
[19:03] the cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[19:06] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[19:09] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[19:11] body for this cause many are weak and
[19:14] sickly among it many sleep for if we
[19:18] should judge ourselves we should not be
[19:20] judged but when we are judged we are
[19:22] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[19:25] be condemned with the world
[19:29] yeah I bring that a point when we are
[19:32] judged by the word which is Christ we're
[19:35] chasen if we're doing wrong we're not
[19:38] living up to this word we're chastened
[19:40] of the Lord and when the Lord chastens
[19:43] us that means corrects us that we should
[19:46] not be condemned with the world we are
[19:50] not of the world Amen we are different
[19:53] from the world live a different life a
[19:55] separated life hallelujah we're never to
[19:57] live the life of the world and be a
[20:00] Christian we're to live a an outstanding
[20:04] life a different life not I don't mean
[20:06] in such social ranks but I mean we're to
[20:08] live a life of genuine Holiness amen
[20:12] that the fruits of the spirit might be
[20:14] seen in us the meekness and gentleness
[20:16] and patience longsuffering Faith the
[20:20] fruit of the spirit for for when we are
[20:23] hear these
[20:24] things then we know we're chasen of the
[20:27] Lord that we don't do
[20:29] then we are condemned and if we have no
[20:32] condemnation within us that we're living
[20:34] Above That Thing by the grace of God
[20:37] then we're not condemned of the world
[20:39] but we're living above the things of the
[20:40] world you see amen wherefor my brethren
[20:43] when you come together to eat carry one
[20:45] for the other and if any man hungry let
[20:47] him eat at home that you be not come
[20:50] together unto condation and the rest I
[20:53] will set in order when I
[20:56] come we've always made great
[20:59] exhortations on this that when we come
[21:02] together even though that we can see
[21:05] nothing there might be something in
[21:07] somebody else that we noticed that
[21:09] wasn't right when you come together to
[21:12] eat this communion I'll wait on one
[21:14] another pray for one another pray that
[21:18] we always make it this I pray for you
[21:21] that if you if there's some sin in you
[21:23] that some unrighteous deed or something
[21:26] you've done as a believer I I pray that
[21:29] God will take it out of you that he'll
[21:31] forgive you for it and you pray for me
[21:33] that if there's some something that I've
[21:35] done that I don't know just about if
[21:37] I've done it and know that's wrong I
[21:39] I'll confess it right now I'm fixing
[21:42] because he that eateth and drth unworthy
[21:44] eat and drinks damnation to himself not
[21:46] Discerning the Lord's body the discern
[21:48] of knowing that you are the Lord's body
[21:51] you can't discern
[21:53] it in wickedness and sin we've got to be
[21:56] above that that we we discern that the
[21:58] Lord is righteous and we discern that
[22:01] he's our propitiation that all of our
[22:03] sins we confess and we believe in him
[22:06] and waiting upon his atonement to
[22:08] cleanse us from all of our iniquity then
[22:10] we're Discerning the Lord's body of what
[22:12] it discernment of what is far then
[22:15] Discerning again that in among us as the
[22:17] Lord's bride body let's discern if
[22:20] there's anything wrong with us in here
[22:22] that would hinder the gospel from
[22:24] growing or the Lord from presenting us
[22:27] to before God as a Chase version let's
[22:31] discern that out right now and find if
[22:32] it's wrong let's confess it let's say
[22:35] Lord I'm sorry about that so therefore
[22:38] there might be something that we've done
[22:40] you've done something I've done it might
[22:42] not be consciously right now let's ask
[22:44] God to forgive us for we used to sing a
[22:47] song Here forgive the the sins I have
[22:50] confessed to
[22:54] thee they don't
[22:56] even unknown things
[22:58] we we we pray God forgive him now I said
[23:01] when you come together carry one for the
[23:03] other and that really would be like this
[23:06] carry one with the other carry means to
[23:08] wait wait on each other let's do that
[23:11] now I pray for you if you know anything
[23:14] that you've done wrong that God forgive
[23:16] me I didn't mean that and if you help me
[23:19] from this night on I will do it again I
[23:22] I mean it Lord I won't do it again if
[23:24] you just forgive me and up all my
[23:26] confession I believe you have for
[23:27] forgive me I go to take the body of
[23:29] Christ feeling in my heart that you
[23:32] forgive me for all my sins I pray then
[23:35] for your secret sin you pray for mine
[23:38] that maybe something we don't know about
[23:40] that we won't come together condemn with
[23:42] the world we don't want the world in
[23:44] here this little spot of people that God
[23:47] has given us to worship with here we
[23:48] want to keep ourselves clean from
