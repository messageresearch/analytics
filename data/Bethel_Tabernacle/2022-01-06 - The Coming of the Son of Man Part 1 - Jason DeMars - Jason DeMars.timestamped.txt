[24:26] jesus christ
[24:28] amen god bless you
[24:30] you can stay standing for a few minutes
[24:33] glad to be in the house of god tonight
[24:36] so thankful for his grace
[24:38] i'm going to be speaking on the coming
[24:40] of the son of man
[24:42] tonight
[24:44] taking a teaching on this topic and
[24:47] first scripture is luke
[24:48] 17
[24:51] and
[24:52] verse 22 just read one verse
[24:58] and he said unto the disciples the days
[25:00] will come when you shall desire to see
[25:02] one of the days of the son of man
[25:05] and you shall not
[25:07] see it amen may the lord add the
[25:09] blessing to the reading of his word he
[25:11] can be seated
[25:17] so
[25:19] i think it was last month and the part
[25:21] of the month before brother jason spoke
[25:23] on the
[25:24] coming of the lord and this is kind of
[25:26] what inspired me
[25:28] to go in that direction i i really
[25:31] enjoyed and appreciated his
[25:33] his ministry on that topic and there's a
[25:36] i was remembering while he was preaching
[25:38] on it some of the points he was making i
[25:40] i think i had heard him speak a special
[25:42] meeting
[25:43] years ago maybe when brother tim pruitt
[25:45] was dedicating the new building i think
[25:47] is when it was
[25:49] and
[25:50] that sermon that i listened to him
[25:52] preach inspired me
[25:53] uh a message that i brought to the
[25:56] saints in uh in turkey
[26:00] and so then just recalling that and then
[26:02] and then
[26:04] brought me back to study a little bit
[26:06] more
[26:07] i have spoken on this topic elsewhere
[26:10] previously but
[26:12] just kind of tweaking things and adding
[26:14] things as as we all grow right we all
[26:16] grow in the lord
[26:18] we all get more revelation from the word
[26:20] i hope we do
[26:22] we should be that's what we're here for
[26:24] amen
[26:26] but
[26:27] looking at it
[26:29] both
[26:30] um
[26:32] looking at it both past tense
[26:34] and then bringing it forward to
[26:37] present tense
[26:38] and so you know we can we can just look
[26:41] back and be
[26:42] so enamored and
[26:44] and impressed
[26:46] and excited about what god has done in
[26:50] the past through brother branham's
[26:51] ministry
[26:52] and we just kind of sit and twiddle our
[26:54] thumbs and and don't enter into what god
[26:56] is doing today
[26:57] and you know some might think that what
[27:00] do you how can you say that what are you
[27:02] talking about that's the message for
[27:03] today it is the message for today it
[27:06] doesn't change but we actually have to
[27:08] grow into that
[27:10] word it's not enough to just say god
[27:13] sent a prophet
[27:15] that's great that's knowing a fact about
[27:17] history god sent a lot of prophets but
[27:20] that doesn't mean that the word of that
[27:22] prophet is living inside of you
[27:24] that just means you're educated enough
[27:26] to read and come to a logical conclusion
[27:29] that's not a supernatural revelation a
[27:31] supernatural revelation it changes you
[27:33] and makes the word live present tense
[27:37] without the word living present tense
[27:40] not in a place that you know about
[27:42] in you
[27:44] not the word living present tense in the
[27:46] pastor in the deacon in your body the
[27:49] word has to live present tense
[27:51] and be manifested in you
[27:54] the bride
[27:56] body of christ is not a bunch of
[27:57] preachers
[27:59] amen it's everybody it's everyone who's
[28:02] been filled with the holy ghost it's not
[28:04] for just the preachers to manifest
[28:06] the presence of christ in this day it's
[28:08] for each of us
[28:10] all right
[28:11] so
[28:12] i want to look at this the token brother
[28:14] branham says we we think the token they
[28:16] say it's just the baptism of the holy
[28:17] ghost it's more than that
[28:20] it's more than just the baptism of the
[28:22] holy ghost
[28:23] the
[28:24] the token himself is here
[28:26] amongst us
[28:29] amen so this is from uh november 28th
[28:32] the token 1963.
[28:35] but the true token of the blood speaking
[28:37] out speaks speaks of a living
[28:40] resurrected presence
[28:43] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[28:45] and forever right
[28:47] living right now among us amen it speaks
[28:50] better
[28:51] from not dead forms and creeds but a
[28:53] living token of a living resurrected
[28:56] christ
[28:57] that lives in us no they deny there is
[28:59] such a thing but we know it's true
[29:01] but we who believe the word know that
[29:03] god promised it and he keeps his promise
[29:06] no it is his living
[29:08] presence for he does as he did that's
[29:12] something more than just your and i
[29:14] baptism of the holy ghost
[29:16] there is a presence of jesus christ
[29:19] dwelling in his people that's different
[29:21] than any other age
[29:23] the fullness of god is here
[29:28] what did brother branham talk about he
[29:29] explained about the logos and he went
[29:31] into the teaching of the logos and the
[29:33] history and how how that logos came
[29:35] forth and he said it's a light begin to
[29:38] form
[29:40] why do you think he was telling that
[29:41] story
[29:42] and he said it that way a light began to
[29:45] form what was it that was appearing in
[29:47] his meetings over and over and over
[29:48] again
[29:49] a supernatural light
[29:51] a pillar of fire what is he trying to
[29:53] say the presence of the very god that
[29:56] created heaven and earth
[29:57] is here amongst the people
[30:00] veiled behind human flesh
[30:07] in 1962 to take on the whole armor of
[30:09] god
[30:10] brother branham says in his army
[30:13] he presents his army in the form of five
[30:15] offices
[30:17] first apostles prophets teachers pastors
[30:19] evangelists
[30:21] that's his army that's his soldiers
[30:23] that's his commanding officers all with
[30:24] the baptism of the holy ghost waiting
[30:26] out there
[30:27] to
[30:28] to meet the enemy on any grounds he
[30:30] comes upon to meet the enemy with the
[30:32] word of god amen each one backing one
[30:34] another up with him the chief captain
[30:37] not out there in front up here above
[30:40] back back behind but in them
[30:43] that's the army vindicating vindicating
[30:45] what his resurrection by the proof of
[30:48] his works
[30:49] john 14 12
[30:51] jesus said he that believeth in me the
[30:53] works that i do shall he do also what is
[30:56] it it's god in the church in these five
[30:59] predestinated offices
[31:01] backing up every word that he said with
[31:03] the holy spirit himself in there which
[31:06] is the word made manifest proving his
[31:08] resurrection proving that he lives
[31:10] all other religions are dead their forms
[31:12] are dead there's only one that's right
[31:14] and that's christianity because christ
[31:16] is a living
[31:17] in the church of christ amen making his
[31:20] words manifest free is the same it's the
[31:23] same work it'll do the same thing and
[31:25] show the same works and the same signs
[31:28] amen
[31:29] amen that isn't to say that it's limited
[31:33] he that believe he that believes in me
[31:35] the works that i do shall he do also do
[31:37] you think that brother branham's saying
[31:38] that's only the five-fold ministry
[31:40] it's not
[31:42] look up that look up that terminology or
[31:44] look up john 14 12 and see every single
[31:47] time
[31:48] brother branham talks about it he says
[31:49] any anyone
[31:52] that would believe that word the works
[31:54] that i do
[31:55] shall he do also
[31:56] it's not just one person it's not just
[31:58] the five-fold ministry
[32:00] it's every one of us
[32:02] and what did what did what did he say
[32:04] over and over again such a simple truth
[32:06] but extremely profound and one that
[32:09] should put us on our knees
[32:12] he said if i if if
[32:15] if i have the spirit of jesus christ and
[32:18] living inside of me
[32:19] just like if i had the spirit of john
[32:21] dilliger inside of me i would do the
[32:23] works of john john dillinger i'd be a
[32:26] crook and a murderer but if i have the
[32:28] spirit of jesus christ inside of me i'll
[32:30] do the same works that he did
[32:34] that's part of what he does in us the
[32:36] same works that he did it's not that's
[32:38] not limited to the fivefold ministry
[32:40] only but it sure better be the five-fold
[32:42] ministry having that works in in their
[32:44] lives
[32:45] seeing the spirit of god move this in
[32:47] their lives the same way that that he
[32:49] did in the lord jesus life
[32:51] amen
[32:53] all right so
[32:55] i'm trying to i want you to see it
[32:58] it's it's it's it is past tense
[33:01] through the life of william branham
[33:03] but that word is working present tense
[33:07] in the bride
[33:08] it's a pro it's a process all right i'll
[33:10] leave that there
[33:12] now we're going to go look at look at
[33:13] history
[33:15] so
[33:16] speaking about the coming of the son of
[33:18] man the coming of the lord
[33:23] you look through history
[33:25] the jewish people were waiting for a
[33:27] messiah right
[33:29] they were looking for the messiah to
[33:32] come they believed he would be a man
[33:34] and they believed they had many beliefs
[33:36] based on scriptures about about him
[33:40] and they actually if
[33:42] if you believe it or not they had it all
[33:43] laid out
[33:45] with precision
[33:46] what would happen when messiah would
[33:49] come
[33:50] so if if you've ever read zechariah
[33:53] chapter one
[33:54] at the end of zechariah chapter one it
[33:56] speaks about four horns
[34:00] that scattered israel in other words
[34:02] scattered them throughout the earth
[34:04] away from jerusalem and from the
[34:07] the the territory of israel scattered
[34:09] them throughout the earth
[34:11] right and then it's then it stops about
[34:13] four
[34:14] craftsmen
[34:16] after that
[34:17] and it says the four craftsmen
[34:19] will cast out the power of the four
[34:22] horns
[34:23] which scattered israel
[34:25] so the jewish people say they they in in
[34:29] history and even today
[34:32] they're still waiting for this they
[34:34] believe that there's going to be four
[34:36] messianic figures that appear
[34:38] they believe that elijah will first come
[34:43] then
[34:44] will come messiah the son of joseph
[34:47] who is the suffering servant he will die
[34:50] in a military battle
[34:52] and then you know there's a messiah ben
[34:54] david which is
[34:56] who will ultimately be the king
[34:59] and then the fourth
[35:01] member of that
[35:03] four
[35:03] four um craftsmen is the godly high
[35:06] priest
[35:07] and so they had it all set out exactly
[35:09] you can go study that
[35:11] and it had they had with precision
[35:14] set up how that was going to happen the
[35:16] military battles that would take place
[35:18] they have the all these thank you all
[35:20] these things laid out from
[35:22] scripture
[35:24] and it was
[35:25] scripturally based
[35:27] and it was the orthodox viewpoint
[35:31] this is how it must happen
[35:34] and
[35:35] there was different factions but the
[35:36] majority faction this is how they
[35:39] believed it would happen
[35:41] well
[35:43] when it did happen
[35:45] is that how it happened
[35:46] it was completely contrary
[35:49] to the first coming of christ
[35:53] and so what is my point why am i
[35:55] bringing that up
[35:58] it's because the very same
[36:00] people
[36:01] today have books upon books upon books
[36:05] of how it's going to happen
[36:08] exactly how it's laid out
[36:10] there's movies about it
[36:12] and you know of course you have the
[36:13] dispensationalist view and then you have
[36:15] other views outside of that but the
[36:17] majority view is dispensationalist
[36:20] and so movies and books upon books upon
[36:24] books
[36:25] about it and everybody's looking for it
[36:27] to come
[36:28] in that specific way
[36:31] and it's already taking place and they
[36:34] have no
[36:35] absolutely
[36:36] zero clue of what's happening
[36:39] it was the same in those days
[36:41] they might have known about it
[36:43] roughly but they certainly didn't
[36:45] believe
[36:46] that it could possibly be
[36:48] this man from nazareth could possibly be
[36:51] the messiah
[36:53] we have it all set out
[36:55] how dare these people try to make some
[36:57] interpretation that messiah
[36:59] will come differently
[37:01] god interprets his word by how
[37:05] sending a theologian
[37:07] someone super smart and he knows the
[37:09] parsing of scripture and he knows how to
[37:12] put together the verb tenses of greek
[37:14] hebrew
[37:16] aramaic
[37:17] he knows five languages and boom then we
[37:20] then we have our understanding
[37:22] there's
[37:23] thousands tens of thousands of doctors
[37:26] of theology
[37:27] in the world today
[37:29] and they all bitterly disagree with each
[37:31] other
[37:32] so god has to have a way that he's going
[37:34] to do it how does he do it he brings his
[37:36] word to pass
[37:38] god interprets his own word by bringing
[37:40] it to pass
[37:45] here are some of the prophetic
[37:46] scriptures
[37:48] you try to put it all together in your
[37:50] own mind of course you'll easily do that
[37:52] because it's already fulfilled
[37:54] messiah comes
[37:56] riding on the donkey
[37:57] zechariah 9. messiah comes in the clouds
[38:00] of heaven
[38:02] daniel
[38:02] 7.
[38:04] messiah has wounds in his hands from the
[38:07] house of his friends
[38:09] zechariah 13
[38:10] isaiah 53 he was wounded for our
[38:13] transgressions
[38:15] messiah's soul will not be left in hell
[38:17] psalm 16
[38:19] psalm 110 messiah is to sit at the right
[38:21] hand of god
[38:23] and we can go on and on and on this the
[38:25] prophetic scriptures speak of the coming
[38:28] of christ
[38:30] who put that to who put all that
[38:31] together
[38:33] john
[38:34] james
[38:35] matthew
[38:37] luke
[38:38] no god put it together by bringing it to
[38:40] pass all they had to do was know this
[38:43] old testament scripture which they did
[38:45] they studied it they knew it
[38:48] and they just watched what happened in
[38:50] jesus life and they could write down
[38:51] what happened there it is that's
[38:53] fulfilled that's fulfilled that's
[38:55] fulfilled that's fulfilled
[38:57] we know there's a second coming
[39:00] how is god going to fulfill his word
[39:02] the same way he did it before
[39:04] did god did god let the people know did
[39:07] he give them clues about it in the old
[39:09] testament absolutely he did
[39:11] what did they do made their own
[39:13] interpretations
[39:15] and said this is how it must come
[39:18] if it doesn't come this way it's not
[39:20] right
[39:20] it's unscriptural
[39:26] all right so we read the scripture
[39:28] you'll desire to see
[39:30] jesus speaking to his
[39:31] disciples you'll desire to see one of
[39:33] the days of the son of man
[39:36] and you'll not see it
[39:38] and when he speaks of his coming his his
[39:41] revealing of himself
[39:43] he refers to the title son of man
[39:46] the coming of this as it was in the days
[39:48] of noah so shall it be
[39:50] at the coming of the son of man as it
[39:52] was in the days of lot so shall it be in
[39:54] the day that the son of man is revealed
[39:57] all right so those are the scriptures
[39:59] he's using we're seeing he's saying the
[40:01] son of man
[40:03] what is
[40:04] son of man
[40:06] number one
[40:07] we think of son of man as well that's
[40:09] just a human being he's the son of a man
[40:12] okay that's that's basically what
[40:16] well-paid theologians think
[40:19] about this verse
[40:24] psalm 8 verse 4
[40:29] what is man that thou art mindful of him
[40:33] and the son of man that thou vist him
[40:37] what is so god is mindful of man
[40:40] but the son of man he put something
[40:42] different
[40:43] what does he say
[40:44] he visits
[40:46] him
[40:48] isn't that interesting
[40:49] when we when we look at the scripture
[40:52] how many times over and over and over
[40:54] and over again it and the word of the
[40:55] lord came to the prophet and the word of
[40:57] the lord came to the prophet
[40:59] so what is the son of man the word of
[41:02] the lord comes to him
[41:04] god visits
[41:06] god visits the son of man in other words
[41:10] son of man is accompanied this this
[41:13] title
[41:14] is accompanied by the very presence of
[41:16] almighty god
[41:18] he is there he is with them ezekiel
[41:22] is referred to as the son of man
[41:25] by god
[41:26] 90 times
[41:31] ezekiel 2 1 says and he said unto me son
[41:33] of man
[41:34] stand upon thy feet and i will speak
[41:36] unto thee
[41:39] so son of man what is ezekiel ezekiel is
[41:43] a prophet
[41:44] so what title does god give ezekiel
[41:48] son of man
[41:50] we understand that there is a son of man
[41:53] which is a prophet which is any prophet
[41:56] is a son of man but then there is the
[42:00] son of man and we can only refer to that
[42:02] as being jesus christ
[42:08] so they're
[42:09] looking at son of man you it's a
[42:11] prophetic ministry accompanied by the
[42:13] anointing
[42:14] of the presence of god himself the very
[42:18] logos of god
[42:20] comes to that prophet
[42:22] he visits
[42:23] them
[42:25] ultimately
[42:26] it's a messianic title
[42:28] what does messiah mean anointed one what
[42:31] is a prophet
[42:32] he's an anointed one
[42:37] so again not every language has
[42:40] that terminology the anointed one
[42:43] a anointed one so if you
[42:45] any of you want to preach on this topic
[42:47] in
[42:48] the middle east it's not going to work
[42:50] saying v and a they won't make any sense
[42:52] at all they'll stand and stare at you
[42:54] like
[42:56] i have no idea how to translate that
[43:02] but for us it makes sense and that's
[43:04] what the prophet told us right a son of
[43:06] man revealing the son of man
[43:11] so again
[43:13] we read that verse
[43:15] the days will come you'll desire to see
[43:17] one of the days of the son of man
[43:20] and you shall not see it
[43:22] in other words it's not free it's not
[43:24] for your time of life
[43:26] it's for the future but what is one of
[43:28] the days of days of the son of man
[43:32] interesting terminology isn't it
[43:34] the days of the son of man and it
[43:36] continues on
[43:38] as you read through that
[43:40] the days of lot and the days of noah are
[43:42] both likened unto
[43:44] what
[43:46] in luke
[43:47] the days of the son of man
[43:51] interesting to wait to speak of it
[43:53] so
[43:54] what did they want to see if jesus is
[43:56] speaking
[43:59] and he says you'll want to see one of
[44:00] the days of the son of man what do they
[44:02] want to see
[44:03] his ministry in action
[44:05] right
[44:06] his prophetic ministry that's that's
[44:09] what they've known him right
[44:11] as a healer
[44:13] as someone who tells the thoughts of
[44:14] people's hearts as someone who foretells
[44:16] things that are about to happen
[44:19] so what were they going to want to see
[44:21] we're going to want to see that
[44:25] telling someone's name and their
[44:27] father's name telling someone
[44:28] what happened to them without even being
[44:30] in the same vicinity
[44:32] turning the water in into wine
[44:34] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[44:36] the heart
[44:37] knowing about people's lives in history
[44:39] of their lives
[44:41] discerning diseases and healing they're
[44:43] wanting to see
[44:45] that
[44:46] all right
[44:48] so let's back up
[44:49] even further
[44:52] let's look at deuteronomy 18 verse 15.
[44:56] i'll do a little study of this
[45:00] and a few other verses
[45:02] the lord thy god
[45:04] will raise up unto thee a prophet from
[45:06] the midst of thee
[45:08] of thy brethren like unto me
[45:11] unto him you shall hearken
[45:14] according to all that thou desirous of
[45:16] the lord thy god and horeb in the day of
[45:18] the assembly saying let me not hear
[45:19] again the voice of the lord my god
[45:21] neither let me see this great fire any
[45:23] more that i die not
[45:24] and the lord said unto me they have well
[45:26] spoken
[45:28] that which they have spoken
[45:30] i will raise them up a prophet from
[45:31] among their brethren like unto thee and
[45:34] will put my words in his mouth and he
[45:35] shall speak unto them
[45:37] all that i shall command him and it
[45:39] shall come to pass
[45:40] that whoever will not hearken unto my
[45:42] words which he shall speak in my name i
[45:45] will require it of him
[45:48] so this
[45:50] this series of verses is
[45:54] particularly a pro a prophecy of the
[45:56] messiah
[45:57] the prophet that's going to be like unto
[45:59] moses
[46:00] is
[46:01] speaking of jesus christ
[46:04] but in general it's a principle because
[46:06] what was the principle
[46:08] they said don't speak to us from this
[46:10] great fire anymore
[46:12] we don't want to die we're going to die
[46:14] if you do this so stop that
[46:16] speak through moses and we'll hear him
[46:19] so god says you you said right
[46:22] i will speak through a prophet so
[46:24] there's a there's a principle
[46:26] that this is how god speaks god will
[46:28] speak to us through a prophet
[46:32] and there's this prophecy which is
[46:34] there's going to be a prophet comes that
[46:36] i will raise up
[46:38] and
[46:39] he'll be like moses
[46:42] moses was
[46:44] faithful in all his house
[46:46] he was he was like a steward
[46:49] of the house of god
[46:51] but jesus is a son
[46:53] over that house
[46:54] right if you think if think of hebrews
[46:57] so moses being a steward but jesus being
[46:59] a son over that house he's the he's the
[47:01] lord of that house amen
[47:03] and so
[47:06] continuing on
[47:10] think about think about this more
[47:13] in more detail
[47:16] god
[47:17] appeared to them
[47:20] on that mountain right
[47:23] the the the there was a visible
[47:25] manifestation
[47:27] and a void there was a fire and a voice
[47:30] of words
[47:31] and so the people say cancel
[47:36] cancel that
[47:37] that's going to kill us we're going to
[47:39] die
[47:40] so
[47:41] can you speak to us through moses
[47:44] so now god is actually changing his veil
[47:46] from the pillar of fire
[47:48] to
[47:49] what
[47:50] a man
[47:52] so the prophetic ministry in office is
[47:55] now to become
[47:57] the visible representative and spokesman
[48:00] for
[48:01] god instead of god appearing directly
[48:03] among the people
[48:05] god veils himself
[48:07] behind a man
[48:10] to speak his words through that man
[48:13] to us
[48:14] again
[48:17] the emphasis this is god doing this
[48:19] right
[48:20] we can emphasize on the veil
[48:23] the man
[48:25] and go a million miles wrong
[48:27] we don't want to emphasize on the veil
[48:29] god will do this and this is god
[48:31] speaking
[48:32] the man is there praise the lord for the
[48:34] man we love the man
[48:36] but we don't worship the man we don't
[48:38] obey the man we realize that it's god
[48:41] speaking through the veil amen
[48:46] so this prophet is to speak god's words
[48:50] in his name in other words as you see
[48:52] throughout the old testament thus saith
[48:54] the lord
[48:56] and god will then require it of us to
[48:58] obey the words of the prophet
[49:01] as though it's the very words of god
[49:02] himself
[49:05] the qualifier again the qualifier in the
[49:08] scripture is
[49:09] the prophet speaks in the name of the
[49:12] lord
[49:13] a prophet
[49:14] is a man
[49:15] he speaks many things he does many
[49:17] things
[49:18] we we see that about elijah we see that
[49:20] about in moses but when that prophet
[49:22] said thus saith the lord it was not the
[49:24] prophet speaking it was not his thoughts
[49:27] it wasn't his ideas it wasn't his
[49:28] interpretation it was god speaking and
[49:32] god will require that of us
[49:37] deuteronomy 18 20
[49:41] but the prophet which shall presume to
[49:44] speak a word in my name which i have not
[49:46] commanded him to speak or that shall
[49:48] speak
[49:49] in the name of other gods even that
[49:51] prophet shall die
[49:56] and if thou say in thy heart how shall
[49:58] we know the word
[50:00] which the lord has not spoken
[50:02] oh this is good
[50:04] because you have two people come and say
[50:05] thus saith the lord
[50:08] how shall we know when a prophet speaks
[50:11] speaks in the name of the lord if the
[50:13] thing
[50:14] the word where it says thing there
[50:17] uh in the english that's that word is
[50:19] debar in hebrew which means word
[50:22] if the word
[50:24] follow
[50:26] so
[50:27] follow not nor come to pass
[50:31] so if the word follow not
[50:34] um or come to pass that sounds
[50:36] repetitive right if it doesn't follow or
[50:39] come to pass
[50:40] that's kind of
[50:42] in a way repeating itself
[50:44] in other words
[50:46] it's fulfilled what the prophet spoken
[50:47] is fulfilled that's what it seems like
[50:49] it's saying
[50:51] but in in the hebrew it says if the word
[50:54] is
[50:55] or exists
[50:58] not
[51:00] nor comes to pass
[51:02] in other words it's referring to
[51:05] something that's now
[51:07] something that's future
[51:10] all right so that seems like okay what's
[51:12] the big deal you'll see what the big
[51:13] deal is in a minute
[51:15] that is the thing which the lord has not
[51:17] spoken but the prophet has spoken it
[51:20] presumptually thou shalt not be afraid
[51:23] of him
[51:24] that word where it says afraid it means
[51:26] you shall not assemble yourself
[51:29] together with him
[51:34] so
[51:34] again god speaks a word and that word
[51:38] exists
[51:40] or comes to pass
[51:42] all right
[51:43] present tense in other words you'll see
[51:45] what it you'll see what it is i'm not
[51:46] going to skip ahead
[52:06] bear with me a second get my
[52:09] note straightened out here
[52:14] so so think of it this think of it in
[52:17] this verse this way
[52:20] the prophet
[52:22] will speak of those things that exist
[52:24] what are those things that exist it's
[52:25] the secrets of the heart
[52:28] it's the things that are in people's
[52:30] minds
[52:31] and in their hearts it's knowledge
[52:34] about
[52:35] some something that's in a person's
[52:38] heart or an event that has taken place
[52:40] in their life that the prophet couldn't
[52:42] get
[52:44] in a human through human means it would
[52:46] have to be a supernatural means in the
[52:48] bible you can think of some examples one
[52:50] of that would be
[52:52] i believe it's um elisha
[52:55] correct me if i'm wrong who knows what
[52:58] the king of um syria
[53:02] speaks in his bed chamber
[53:05] right
[53:06] that's the things that are the prophet
[53:08] knowing the thing there's no possibility
[53:10] that's hundreds thousands of miles away
[53:13] from where the prophet is only by the
[53:15] spirit of god could he know that
[53:18] um
[53:19] of course in the ministry of
[53:22] jesus christ it's you know when you meet
[53:24] someone and tells them their name and
[53:26] something about their life
[53:29] so the prophet
[53:31] can speak a prophecy
[53:34] and how would we know if he's speaking
[53:36] the truth to us
[53:37] if you think think about it that way
[53:39] it's a prophecy it's of the future nine
[53:42] times out of ten if you look at
[53:44] prophecies in the scripture you can't
[53:45] tell if it's pr past present or future
[53:49] you
[53:50] sometimes it's very clear and it's easy
[53:51] to understand other times you say
[53:54] i don't even know what he's talking
[53:55] about let alone whether it's come to
[53:57] pass or not
[53:58] it's very mysterious
[54:00] and this can be the case with past
[54:03] prophets or present prophets
[54:06] a thing that a prophet says about the
[54:08] future
[54:09] could be very different than what the
[54:11] literal interpretation
[54:13] of the words that he speaks really is
[54:16] in other words we can't be sure because
[54:18] what is it god interprets his own word
[54:21] so if a prophet foretells sometimes it's
[54:23] very simple
[54:24] other times it can be very mysterious
[54:26] when you're telling about a vision you
[54:27] had and it's all in symbols what does it
[54:29] mean well we all can come up and know of
[54:32] hundreds of interpretations of brother
[54:34] branham's symbolic visions
[54:38] what symbol does it mean well i have my
[54:40] interpretation no my interpretation's
[54:42] right
[54:42] god will bring his interpretation to
[54:44] pass in the season that he wants to
[54:46] bring it to pass
[54:48] and you know what i'm talking about i'll
[54:49] ride this trail one once more the tent
[54:53] vision so on and so forth
[54:55] wonderful
[54:57] things have been spoken about this
[55:01] it's not up to us to bring it to pass
[55:03] it's not up to me to interpret it i need
[55:06] to have a spirit of discernment to know
[55:08] if it's come to pass right
[55:10] but
[55:12] god will let us know god has a way to
[55:14] let us know and it hasn't changed
[55:18] so if god has something more for us
[55:20] then he'd have to
[55:21] just this is god's prayer i'm not saying
[55:23] this is what going to happen but god's
[55:25] principle
[55:27] we should pray and ask god to speak to
[55:29] us and how will he speak to us through a
[55:32] prophet
[55:33] so if god wants to further interpret
[55:35] brother branham's message i think he'll
[55:37] send us another prophet
[55:40] and then god will vindicate that the
[55:42] prophet
[55:43] it's
[55:44] bible principles right
[55:46] but then if we if that were to happen
[55:48] now we have an eighth messenger
[55:51] and we have another prophet and that
[55:53] doesn't work that way does it
[55:56] god has sent his word
[55:58] the prophet is off the scene the message
[56:00] is finished now it's got to get off of
[56:02] the books and the tapes and get into our
[56:05] lives
[56:06] so that we are the living manifestation
[56:08] of that message
[56:10] you are the message that's what the
[56:12] message is the me why are you the
[56:14] message because that word is living
[56:16] itself through you
[56:19] okay
[56:20] so we don't need to interpret brother
[56:21] branham's future
[56:23] prophecies because the same principle
[56:26] that he applied
[56:27] to the biblical prophecies applies to
[56:30] his
[56:31] okay
[56:32] well we don't have to kick each other
[56:33] upside the head
[56:36] with our interpretations
[56:38] of
[56:39] prophecies of brother branham
[56:41] we could just leave them alone and stick
[56:44] with the things that are clear
[56:46] and live a godly life i think that's
[56:49] something brother branham said don't try
[56:51] to interpret it but live a godly life
[56:54] amen
[56:56] so how do we know okay the prophet gives
[56:59] a thousand future prophecies writes them
[57:02] all down how do we know if he's a true
[57:03] prophet
[57:04] should we wait 800 years like isaiah
[57:08] you can't wait 800 years you have to
[57:10] make a decision right now
[57:13] is this a true prophet or not how do we
[57:15] know
[57:17] the things that he speaks now
[57:20] what he says the things that exist if
[57:23] the thing exists not
[57:25] then he's not sent by god
[57:28] amen because the the purpose of this is
[57:31] the prop in the old testament this was
[57:33] about whether the prophet should be put
[57:35] to death or not
[57:37] so
[57:38] if he's going to be put to death we have
[57:40] to know we have to have some knowledge
[57:42] of this we have to have some
[57:43] understanding we don't just do it based
[57:45] on our emotions or feelings if you
[57:47] forward it to the new testament
[57:49] we decide whether we decide that we
[57:52] believe that brother branham's a true
[57:53] prophet or not we have to have some
[57:55] standard
[57:56] it can't be our own emotions it can't be
[57:58] our own feelings it has to be the word
[58:00] of god
[58:01] and brother branham told us to search
[58:03] what he said by the bible over and over
[58:05] and over again
[58:08] but if we examine
[58:12] examine this examine brother branham's
[58:14] ministry the things that he spoke about
[58:17] that exist
[58:18] we see that there's an infallible gift
[58:21] not only do you see that through through
[58:23] reading his messages listening to his
[58:25] messages but you hear that in the
[58:27] testimonies of those who are
[58:28] there with him that saw him
[58:30] discerning the hearts
[58:32] of the people thousands and thousands of
[58:35] times
[58:40] and i want to just for the sake of time
[58:43] look at numbers 12 but i'm not going to
[58:45] read
[58:46] the whole part
[58:50] i want to
[58:51] get to verse six
[58:56] so
[58:58] miriam and aaron spoke against
[59:00] moses because of
[59:01] the ethiopian woman whom he married
[59:05] and
[59:08] because of that they said god didn't
[59:09] only speak through moses he spoke
[59:11] through us too
[59:14] and then the lord came down in the
[59:15] pillar of of cloud and stood in the door
[59:18] of the tabernacle and called
[59:21] aaron and miriam
[59:23] forth
[59:25] numbers 12 6 and he said not here now my
[59:27] words
[59:28] if there be a prophet among you i the
[59:30] lord will make myself known unto him in
[59:33] a vision
[59:34] and will speak unto him in a dream
[59:37] my servant moses is not so who is
[59:40] faithful in all my house
[59:42] with him will i speak mouth to mouth
[59:44] even apparently and not in dark speeches
[59:47] and the similitude of the lord shall he
[59:48] behold wherefore then were you not
[59:51] afraid to speak against my servant
[59:54] moses so here he puts a difference
[59:57] differentiates between
[59:59] a regular prophet
[1:00:00] and moses
[1:00:04] he says the regular prophet i will
[1:00:08] give visions i'll speak to in dreams
[1:00:11] but with moses i'm not going to do it
[1:00:12] that way
[1:00:14] so even even there you see a division
[1:00:16] between types of prophets remember is
[1:00:19] saul counted among the prophet prophets
[1:00:21] well saul wasn't what we would call a
[1:00:23] major prophet
[1:00:25] even though that division between major
[1:00:27] and minor prophets is not
[1:00:29] actually real
[1:00:31] all the prophets that we have
[1:00:33] listed
[1:00:34] in the old testament and we have their
[1:00:36] books were major prophets god was
[1:00:38] working through them in their lives in
[1:00:40] that age to bring a message to the
[1:00:42] people
[1:00:43] for that age and for future times
[1:00:48] so so someone that has an anointing they
[1:00:51] can have a vision
[1:00:52] they can have a dream
[1:00:54] but moses is different
[1:00:56] my
[1:00:57] my he'll look he'll look and see
[1:01:01] the similitude of the lord in other
[1:01:02] words the image
[1:01:04] of the lord the very manifestation of
[1:01:06] god he'll look and see see it he'll see
[1:01:09] that and i'll speak to moses face to
[1:01:11] face
[1:01:13] so that's something completely different
[1:01:16] than what god was dealing with moses and
[1:01:18] aaron yeah
[1:01:19] you guys i spoke to you in dreams and
[1:01:21] visions
[1:01:23] very nice but you should be a little bit
[1:01:25] more afraid because i don't just speak
[1:01:27] to moses in dreams and visions
[1:01:29] i speak to them like
[1:01:31] we're buddies
[1:01:33] that's complete something completely
[1:01:34] different and remember
[1:01:37] that
[1:01:39] jesus is a prophet like unto moses
[1:01:42] so
[1:01:43] think of it think of it even further as
[1:01:45] jesus was not only speaking to god face
[1:01:48] to face he was the face of god
[1:01:50] he was the visible manifestation of god
[1:01:53] to us
[1:01:56] amen the unveiling of god brother
[1:01:58] branham says moses was the veil
[1:02:01] the living word of god veiled behind
[1:02:03] human flesh the pillar of fire was in
[1:02:05] moses of course speaking what was to be
[1:02:08] veiled later behind skins you see
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:22] so again this prophetic ministry
[1:02:26] is to be repeated
[1:02:27] this that type of prophetic ministry
[1:02:29] that moses had is to be then repeated
[1:02:33] how was it repeated it was repeated in
[1:02:35] jesus christ but then what did jesus say
[1:02:38] you'll desire to see
[1:02:40] one of the days of the son of man
[1:02:42] but you'll not see it
[1:02:44] so
[1:02:46] think forward push it forward what the
[1:02:49] things that i've said and spoken about
[1:02:51] seeing the image of god manifesting the
[1:02:54] presence of god veiling god
[1:02:56] that was done in moses
[1:02:59] now it was to be repeated there's going
[1:03:00] to be a prophet like moses jesus christ
[1:03:03] fulfilled that
[1:03:04] and now jesus says there's going to be
[1:03:07] a time on earth called the days of the
[1:03:09] son of man
[1:03:10] and during that time what's going to
[1:03:12] happen you're going to see the coming of
[1:03:14] the son of man
[1:03:16] the revealing of the son of man
[1:03:30] again we
[1:03:32] we spoke about the identification
[1:03:35] of the ministry of jesus christ he told
[1:03:37] them the thoughts and intents of their
[1:03:39] hearts he told them the secrets of their
[1:03:41] lives all right that's what the people
[1:03:45] were looking for he was
[1:03:46] he was not merely declaring future
[1:03:49] things
[1:03:50] right he was declaring the things
[1:03:52] that were hidden
[1:03:53] in hearts
[1:03:55] things that god could only know
[1:04:01] and soon
[1:04:03] soon they would desire to see one of
[1:04:05] those days
[1:04:06] but it wasn't for them
[1:04:09] let's look and let's turn there to luke
[1:04:11] 17
[1:04:13] and we're going to look at
[1:04:16] verse starting at verse
[1:04:19] 24.
[1:04:28] now we'll back up we'll start at
[1:04:31] verse 23
[1:04:34] and they shall say to you
[1:04:36] see here
[1:04:37] or see there go not after them nor
[1:04:40] follow them
[1:04:43] for as the lightning that lighteneth out
[1:04:45] of the one part
[1:04:47] under heaven shineth unto the other part
[1:04:49] under heaven
[1:04:50] so shall also
[1:04:52] the son of man be in his day in other
[1:04:54] words it's not going to be something
[1:04:56] that's hidden in some
[1:04:58] out in some desert place where you have
[1:04:59] to go to one particular place in order
[1:05:02] to witness
[1:05:04] the coming of the son of man it's going
[1:05:06] to be a worldwide phenomenon
[1:05:13] but but but first and i want to look at
[1:05:16] that lightning a little bit closer as we
[1:05:18] go on
[1:05:20] but first must he suffer many things and
[1:05:22] be rejected of this generation
[1:05:27] and as it was in the days of noah
[1:05:30] so shall it be also
[1:05:33] in the days of the son of man so the
[1:05:35] days of noah
[1:05:37] are likened unto the days
[1:05:39] of the son of man
[1:05:42] so how long were the days of noah
[1:05:45] there doesn't have to be an exact
[1:05:47] parallel
[1:05:48] but the days of noah was what a period
[1:05:50] of time
[1:05:51] 120 years
[1:05:53] from the time he started building the
[1:05:55] ark until the until
[1:05:57] all that process was finished
[1:06:00] so
[1:06:01] it's a period of time so why do why does
[1:06:04] jesus then
[1:06:06] refer to his well in other places he
[1:06:09] calls the coming
[1:06:10] here he refers to it as days
[1:06:13] the days of the son of man
[1:06:17] well i thought it was gonna be like
[1:06:18] lightning and it's gonna just come
[1:06:19] instantly like that in two seconds
[1:06:22] how can you have lightning in one verse
[1:06:24] and the other verse say the days of the
[1:06:26] son of man
[1:06:28] maybe lightning is not referring to
[1:06:30] something that's just instant
[1:06:32] maybe it's referring to what lightning
[1:06:34] does
[1:06:38] but first he must suffer many things as
[1:06:40] the days of noah so shall it be also in
[1:06:42] the days of the son of man they did
[1:06:44] eat they drank they married wives they
[1:06:47] were given in marriage until the day
[1:06:49] that noah entered into the ark and the
[1:06:50] flood came and destroyed them all
[1:06:53] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:06:55] lot
[1:06:56] they did eat they drank they bought they
[1:06:59] sold they planted they builded
[1:07:01] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:07:03] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:07:06] heaven and destroyed them all even thus
[1:07:08] shall it be in the day
[1:07:10] when the son of man is revealed
[1:07:15] again the days of lot it's a period of
[1:07:17] time
[1:07:19] before leading up to the destruction of
[1:07:22] the world
[1:07:24] it's not an immediate and instantaneous
[1:07:27] event
[1:07:28] like the denominational systems have to
[1:07:30] have you to believe
[1:07:32] they believe that the coming of the lord
[1:07:34] is just that instant the rapture
[1:07:37] that's it and we meet the lord in the
[1:07:38] air we go to the marriage supper
[1:07:41] tribulation period hits and then he
[1:07:43] comes down to earth at the end of that
[1:07:45] tribulation period
[1:07:48] here we see it referred to as a period
[1:07:50] of time
[1:07:53] how long
[1:07:54] we don't know it's been going on a while
[1:07:57] now hasn't it
[1:07:59] but how long will it be that these days
[1:08:01] of the son of man or as it's referred to
[1:08:03] in matthew the coming of the son of man
[1:08:06] how long will it be
[1:08:10] wouldn't you like to know
[1:08:14] i'd like to know but it'd probably make
[1:08:16] me live pretty lazy right now
[1:08:21] and not be going through the things that
[1:08:22] i need to be going through to get get
[1:08:24] myself in position for the rapture
[1:08:35] so
[1:08:36] it says the the son of man will be
[1:08:39] revealed that's the word apocalypto
[1:08:41] which literally means to uncover or
[1:08:44] unveil
[1:08:45] the son of man so in other words he's
[1:08:48] he's hidden
[1:08:49] from the people and he's going to be
[1:08:52] unsealed
[1:08:54] and revealed to the people
[1:08:57] there will be a time coming when the son
[1:08:59] of man will be manifested to the world
[1:09:02] as we saw that verse the lightning it
[1:09:04] lightens
[1:09:06] out of one part under heaven and shines
[1:09:09] to the other part
[1:09:11] under heaven so shall also the son of
[1:09:14] man be in his day what do you hear
[1:09:15] brother branham say so many times
[1:09:17] regarding that verse the same
[1:09:19] sun that's shown in the east
[1:09:22] to the jewish people is the same sun
[1:09:24] that will shine
[1:09:26] the same lightning that will shine in
[1:09:28] the west to be revealed to the gentiles
[1:09:32] but what does lightning do
[1:09:34] it brings illumination
[1:09:36] when you're driving down the road and
[1:09:38] you kind of have open spot which there's
[1:09:40] not many here in south carolina but if
[1:09:42] you ever run across that somewhere else
[1:09:45] and you're driving and there's an open
[1:09:46] spot and the lightning comes immediately
[1:09:49] everything is illuminated and you see
[1:09:51] all the things that are around you
[1:09:54] that's what the son of man is to do
[1:09:56] in his day
[1:09:57] during a period of time
[1:10:00] when he's being revealed
[1:10:02] he will bring illumination
[1:10:04] amen
[1:10:06] that unveiling
[1:10:08] itself
[1:10:09] brings the illumination
[1:10:12] in a dark age it's the son of man
[1:10:14] ministry discerning names past events
[1:10:16] sicknesses
[1:10:18] healings but beyond that
[1:10:20] it's the unveiling of the word
[1:10:22] taking the things that were hidden
[1:10:24] through the church age opening them up
[1:10:26] to us so that they're revealed
[1:10:28] to us
[1:10:30] in the unveiling of god brother branham
[1:10:32] says look don't you see
[1:10:34] it's been veiled through these ages
[1:10:36] according to what god said and it will
[1:10:37] be opened in the last days
[1:10:39] those seven seals would be broken the
[1:10:41] full thing would come into the interview
[1:10:43] of the people what's took place all
[1:10:45] along
[1:10:47] the hour of the seventh angels message
[1:10:48] all the mysteries of god should be made
[1:10:50] known
[1:10:51] in that elijah this last hour how that
[1:10:54] christ is put out of the church
[1:10:56] son of god how he's his revealed as the
[1:10:58] son of man again how that church is to
[1:11:01] be put in order and everything for the
[1:11:02] last day no creed no denomination just
[1:11:05] absolutely the word living in the
[1:11:08] individual
[1:11:09] amen isn't that beautiful
[1:11:11] the things that were veiled
[1:11:13] through the ages
[1:11:15] what did he do he opened those seven
[1:11:18] seals
[1:11:19] he broke them open so that the full
[1:11:20] thing
[1:11:22] could come into view that was the
[1:11:24] purpose of that of the message the
[1:11:26] message that we're feeding on
[1:11:28] is to make make known all the mysteries
[1:11:31] of god for us in our day amen
[1:11:37] first thessalonians 4
[1:11:42] 16 for the lord himself
[1:11:45] shall descend from heaven with the shout
[1:11:47] with the voice of the archangel and with
[1:11:49] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[1:11:52] shall rise
[1:11:54] first
[1:11:58] brother branham says this in the rapture
[1:11:59] message a shout
[1:12:01] what is the shout
[1:12:03] now
[1:12:04] y'all that didn't grow up in the message
[1:12:07] when you read this or heard it for the
[1:12:09] first time
[1:12:10] you were flabbergasted you about fell
[1:12:13] out of your car
[1:12:14] or your chair or your couch or whatever
[1:12:17] you were sitting on when you heard this
[1:12:18] the first time i know i did
[1:12:21] i started sweating almost what is he
[1:12:23] saying
[1:12:24] this is incredible
[1:12:26] never heard anything like it in my life
[1:12:29] those of you that grew up in the message
[1:12:30] yeah okay
[1:12:33] let it shock you
[1:12:35] the shout
[1:12:37] what is the shout out
[1:12:41] well it's just a loud noise you know
[1:12:44] the brother preacher over in germany
[1:12:45] just says it's a loud noise that happens
[1:12:48] at the rapture don't pay attention what
[1:12:50] brother branham said
[1:12:53] what is the shout it's the message
[1:12:56] going forth first
[1:12:59] the living bread of life bringing forth
[1:13:02] the bride
[1:13:06] now next what does brother branham say
[1:13:09] if you've listened to the rapture
[1:13:10] message you'll remember but
[1:13:12] he says now god has a way of doing
[1:13:15] things
[1:13:16] and he never changes his policy
[1:13:19] he never changes his policy he's the
[1:13:20] unchanging god in amos 3 7 he said he
[1:13:23] would do nothing on the earth until
[1:13:25] first he revealed it to his servants the
[1:13:27] prophets
[1:13:28] but were promised in the last days
[1:13:30] according to malachi 4 that there would
[1:13:32] be a return again a prophet in the land
[1:13:35] that's right
[1:13:36] a shout
[1:13:38] that shout is the message going forth
[1:13:41] first
[1:13:42] then that message has to get into a many
[1:13:45] membered bride
[1:13:46] and i believe it becomes the voice of
[1:13:48] the archangel in that bride
[1:13:53] but it's the same message it's not a new
[1:13:54] message
[1:13:56] that message in his people
[1:14:02] so back up a second what did the verse
[1:14:04] say
[1:14:05] the lord himself shall descend from
[1:14:07] heaven with uh
[1:14:10] so that means the shout tells us what
[1:14:13] what happened before that the lord has
[1:14:15] what
[1:14:16] descended from heaven
[1:14:19] uh-oh
[1:14:21] brother branham you mean that yeah in
[1:14:23] fact he says
[1:14:25] in in this sermon when you see god
[1:14:27] come
[1:14:28] from heaven
[1:14:29] and stand before groups of men
[1:14:31] and stand there and declare himself just
[1:14:33] as he ever did
[1:14:35] that's the truth with this bible open
[1:14:37] well what did you
[1:14:39] no one saw god come down from heaven
[1:14:43] right
[1:14:44] there's one person that saw god come
[1:14:45] down from heaven
[1:14:47] the prophet saw saw god come down from
[1:14:49] heaven but what does the prophet do he
[1:14:50] explains it to you
[1:14:52] he's the mouthpiece to say god has
[1:14:54] failed behind human flesh this is the
[1:14:57] coming of the lord
[1:14:58] but it doesn't just stop with that one
[1:15:00] man isn't that amazing
[1:15:02] it goes on to a many membered bride
[1:15:06] but his purpose was to veil god so that
[1:15:10] we would hear what what the prophet has
[1:15:12] to say so that we know we're in the
[1:15:14] phases of the coming of the lord
[1:15:24] matthew 24
[1:15:32] verse 36-39
[1:15:40] but of that day an hour knoweth no man
[1:15:43] no
[1:15:44] not the angels of heaven but my father
[1:15:46] only if you're if you remember this was
[1:15:48] part of the seventh seal
[1:15:50] brother branham says the the
[1:15:55] the silence in
[1:15:57] heaven for the space of half hour is
[1:15:59] equated to the angels not knowing
[1:16:03] anything on the the father only
[1:16:07] but as the days of noah were
[1:16:10] so shall also the coming of the son of
[1:16:12] man be did we just read that
[1:16:15] the days of noah and the day
[1:16:17] and the days of the son of man here a
[1:16:19] new term is introduced and it says the
[1:16:21] coming of the son of man
[1:16:24] for as in the days that were before the
[1:16:25] flood they were eating and drinking
[1:16:27] marrying and given in marriage until the
[1:16:28] day that noah
[1:16:30] entered into the ark and knew it and
[1:16:32] knew not until the flood came
[1:16:34] and took them all the way so took them
[1:16:36] all away so shall also
[1:16:38] the coming of the son of man be
[1:16:41] so again a period of time
[1:16:43] leading up to destruction
[1:16:48] that's what the days of the son of man
[1:16:49] is that's what the coming
[1:16:51] of the son of man is
[1:16:59] i'm just wanting to grab
[1:17:01] yeah
[1:17:03] in
[1:17:04] 1958 in the sermon that called out
[1:17:08] brother branham
[1:17:09] speaking on
[1:17:13] these verses he says
[1:17:15] jesus said
[1:17:17] when the son of man is revealed from
[1:17:19] heaven
[1:17:20] let me close by saying this that the son
[1:17:23] of man
[1:17:24] is now being revealed from heaven
[1:17:27] will it come after a while brother
[1:17:29] branham
[1:17:30] it is now
[1:17:32] and i won't i i hope i won't have to
[1:17:34] make this so personal of this own
[1:17:35] meeting but that your spirit within you
[1:17:38] that's given you by god can read what
[1:17:39] i'm talking about
[1:17:42] take a deep breath because this should
[1:17:46] this should make you
[1:17:47] real for a little bit
[1:17:50] it's amazing the son of man
[1:17:53] has already come from glory
[1:17:56] and is revealing himself for the past
[1:17:58] few years to his church in mercy
[1:18:01] showing them his great presence
[1:18:04] doing the same things that he did when
[1:18:06] he was here on earth
[1:18:07] revealing himself like he did to abraham
[1:18:10] before the destruction
[1:18:12] he has come now in mercy revealing
[1:18:15] himself to the church it's being laughed
[1:18:17] at and scoffed at it still is
[1:18:19] the next time he reveals itself it'll be
[1:18:22] in judgment on the world and the nation
[1:18:23] that's forgot god
[1:18:25] in sin their way of grace their day of
[1:18:27] grace rather away because they have
[1:18:29] forgotten god and they're doing the same
[1:18:31] thing that they did to the angel of the
[1:18:33] lord back there mocking and making fun
[1:18:36] fun of it
[1:18:37] but he's here now
[1:18:38] in mercy
[1:18:40] isn't that beautiful
[1:18:42] i'm just going to repeat that sentence
[1:18:44] again because it's so awesome
[1:18:46] the son of man has already come from
[1:18:48] glory again
[1:18:50] step back for a second
[1:18:52] here's a man who has a ministry
[1:18:55] and it's unique
[1:18:57] and it's incredible what god is doing an
[1:19:00] angel met him just as a observer all
[1:19:03] right and you're sitting in the audience
[1:19:05] and you've been there and you've seen
[1:19:07] him and he's telling the people that
[1:19:08] come on the platform and then he's
[1:19:10] telling people in the audience
[1:19:12] what's going on in their lives telling
[1:19:13] what they've been praying about
[1:19:16] that's an incredible thing to think
[1:19:18] about right there
[1:19:21] you praying in in secret
[1:19:23] things that happen
[1:19:25] i was just listening to a sermon today
[1:19:27] told a lady what was happening in her
[1:19:29] bathroom just so you know
[1:19:32] that it was the lord this happened in
[1:19:34] your bathroom
[1:19:36] yes yes yes she says on you can hear it
[1:19:39] on the tape
[1:19:41] so that's that's what
[1:19:44] is happening
[1:19:45] in front of the people
[1:19:47] and here he is who should explain what's
[1:19:49] happening
[1:19:52] who should be the one that should
[1:19:53] explain
[1:19:54] maybe i should come along and give my
[1:19:56] interpretation of what what god was
[1:19:58] doing through this ministry no
[1:20:00] the man
[1:20:01] that god was working through probably
[1:20:04] could explain what was happening
[1:20:07] and i'm telling you this what he's
[1:20:10] saying here is radical
[1:20:13] it's a radical departure
[1:20:15] from anything that anyone
[1:20:19] has taught will teach
[1:20:22] it is incredible the son of man has
[1:20:25] already come from glory and is revealing
[1:20:27] himself for the past few years to his
[1:20:29] church in mercy
[1:20:31] showing them his great presence doing
[1:20:32] the same things that he did when he was
[1:20:34] here on earth revealing himself like he
[1:20:37] did to abraham
[1:20:38] before the destruction he's come now in
[1:20:40] mercy revealing himself
[1:20:43] to
[1:20:44] the church amen
[1:20:47] musicians if you'd come would
[1:20:49] try to close here
[1:20:51] shortly
[1:20:57] so when you're listening to the tapes
[1:21:01] and you're hearing
[1:21:02] the discernment and
[1:21:04] what's happening
[1:21:07] it's not just a discernment it's not
[1:21:09] just a gift of the spirit
[1:21:12] it is
[1:21:13] god himself
[1:21:15] revealing himself
[1:21:17] through a prophet
[1:21:19] it's the coming of the son of man
[1:21:22] it's the son of man
[1:21:23] come in mercy revealing himself to his
[1:21:26] church
[1:21:28] and so what did god do all those
[1:21:29] miracles for
[1:21:31] well let's let the man explain it and
[1:21:33] the sermon be not afraid 1960 he says we
[1:21:36] are strangers to one another now that
[1:21:38] ought to settle it for the whole group
[1:21:39] of you
[1:21:40] does that confirm that i'm preaching the
[1:21:42] truth
[1:21:43] how would god let me tell something
[1:21:45] wrong and stand up with my very message
[1:21:48] these things
[1:21:49] these things so these things he's saying
[1:21:51] is he's been discerning people's hearts
[1:21:54] and lives and praying for them
[1:21:56] to be delivered
[1:21:58] says these things
[1:21:59] are only to indicate
[1:22:02] a divine vindication that my theology
[1:22:05] is right
[1:22:07] that's exactly right the word of the
[1:22:08] lord come to the prophets
[1:22:13] so the son of man ministry manifests the
[1:22:16] presence of god
[1:22:18] it unveils god and brings that
[1:22:21] illumination to the elect
[1:22:23] but then what happens what happens then
[1:22:25] we have that illumination right
[1:22:28] we have that illumination from the
[1:22:30] message so we're just supposed to get
[1:22:32] really revelated
[1:22:33] and full of knowledge no that revelation
[1:22:36] comes
[1:22:37] why
[1:22:38] to prepare us for the rapture to make us
[1:22:40] ready for the rapture
[1:22:42] the
[1:22:43] the message that god brought through
[1:22:46] that man
[1:22:47] is to make us ready
[1:22:49] so
[1:22:50] what should we do we should be preaching
[1:22:51] it on this pulpit and we should be
[1:22:53] feeding that on that word on a daily
[1:22:55] basis
[1:22:56] don't make it a side dish
[1:22:58] make it your main
[1:23:01] course on a daily basis
[1:23:03] let's stand up
[1:23:09] heavenly father we're so thankful
[1:23:14] for the revelation of these things lord
[1:23:18] you've indicated this message to to let
[1:23:20] us know
[1:23:21] that you are here
[1:23:24] as the prophet said my ministry is
[1:23:26] different
[1:23:28] my ministry is to declare him that he's
[1:23:30] here
[1:23:32] and now we know lord that your your
[1:23:34] coming is in phases just like your first
[1:23:37] coming it took place over
[1:23:39] a period of time
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:42] and now it's taking a place again over a
[1:23:44] period of time lord and you're
[1:23:45] continuing
[1:23:47] to call your elect and reveal yourself
[1:23:49] to them lord and
[1:23:50] and so thankful that we can be a part
[1:23:52] lord not only just be revealed to but we
[1:23:55] can be

[1:24:02] very manifestation of the son of man in
[1:24:04] this day lord

[1:24:11] living christ manifesting himself
