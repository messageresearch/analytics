always wanted to live near the ocean so I'm glad they chose Buford and came to sojourn among us we're going to go to Genesis chapter one today it's a great place to start and I want to as you're finding your spot there give you a little update a wonderful little update I got from Sister Linda concerning her daughter charity who's really been through a battle been in the hospital for a while we've been praying her up back up onto her feet again and uh sister Linda writes to say she is resting and receiving I'm sorry resting and recovering presently spending the weekend with us oh that's so nice God is such a comfort and drops such blessings upon us having her with me is a great blessing I had not foreseen praise the Lord thank the church thank you all for their prayers and Thanksgiving of a complete work we were actually supposed to uh probably two weeks ago send a prayer cloth up I got the address sister uh Linda Faithfully sent me the contact information for charity and and uh called to see if she'd like to have it she would so uh but in the shuffle of things um we didn't get it sent but we've been praying and the Lord answers prayer amen I probably should go ahead and fulfill that promise because you never know the devil's always busy amen so maybe at the end brother Luther if you wave at me throw something at me make sure you get my attention we'll have the ministry team come up and we'll pray over prayer cloth and get it sent to her so she's there with uh Brother Bruce and sister Linda amen sister charity if you're there and Watching God bless you we're happy that you are recovering praise the name of the Lord all right Genesis chapter 1 today we're going to take our 12th installment on uh the voice in the East Wind and I really had to go over a lot of U material to figure out what I had covered I've preached two other places since we preached part 11 and a lot of times I don't I preach a lot I preach on the radio on the internet a lot of different things seem like every day uh four or five days a week I'm doing a Bible study with somebody or ministering amen we just recently started ministering Amen on Tuesday Mornings Amen brother Chris asked me to come and amen give his his whole team a morning Bible study so if I'm preaching here Sunday and then there Tuesday and then preaching here Wednesday and then I'm on a Callin Thursday and then and then sometime and then I think this week I got to be on Thursday and Friday and so uh so I said all that to say this that that gets my mind really going it just stays in the word all the time so I I have so much to say amen and I was really struggling this morning trying to figure out what have I said what have I not said and uh thankfully brother Mark coffee sends me updates transcriptions uh of my sermons and uh so I was able to go back and realize where I left off with you with here I preached some of this out but we're going to carry it on today I don't know if we will end the series today I keep I started saying that around part six or seven so I've just quit saying it amen we're just going to keep going as long as I feel the burden in that frame of thought the voice in the East Wind amen we want to um give you an update um so sister Deborah and brother Travis are in the hospital now for the delivery of uh baby miles oh I didn't know we had a name praise the Lord be praying all goes well amen be praying the baby comes soon amen praise the lord we sure will do that more than one way to build a church amen so we're happy in the Lord for them trusting that the Lord will just bless that as he always has amen Genesis chapter 1 let's read verses 1 through five in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon on the face of the waters and God said so God is really busy here and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night it's interesting to me that after he called it good he still had quite a bit of work to do man he created it it came right it was a it was a completely a product 100% of his spoken word as Paul taught us he created it out of nothing he just spoke it and his creative word went to work and created it but yet even when he created it he created it it came from him and he said it was good and then he still had work to to do amen right and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning or the first day and verse goes down through Day 2 3 4 5 and six verse 31 and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day chapter 2 verse1 thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made let's pray father we thank you for your word today and Lord I'm so grateful to you Lord that you came on the scene when I needed you father to try to settle my mind so much to say but uh we have a a finite amount of time to say it in so Lord we just want to be very proficient and very studious and we want to say everything that you once said and I want to have it in the order and Lord in my own mind it seemed just everywhere and large and more than I could say and but Lord you just came on the scene I'm so grateful you just settled me down you began to speak to me you begin to line it out for me so today Lord I just stand here with such a peace in my heart such a confidence in you so now Lord I'm just here as your assistant you know that's all I am just your assistant they sang a song I followed you out here Lord that's all I know so here we go Lord I give it into your hands completely in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can have your seats when we left off last time in the 11th installment we found a lamb coming forward from eternity from the eternities as brother brandham said to claim The Book of Life to open it to loose the Seven Seals thereof the same seals that that Christ had sealed the word the word of God and the Mystery of God the mystery of Christ had been sealed once the church began to fall away from her first love she began to backslide she began to Trend downward and the apostles are going off the scene the gnostics are already invading the pull pits and the churches and uh the the apostles that are Left Alive are writing urgent letters we need to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints you know where they they start talking about this one and this judaizer and this one that doesn't receive John anymore and John's going to have to go try to deal with this and they've got Paul and they execute him they put John on patmas and and we find that you know by the time John comes back uh is that we find that you the word now is is is showing that it's got a seal on it and and from there by the time you get past irenius brother brandham said he's actually the last one that even had a clear understanding of the godhead and that's a Paramount Doctrine because if you can't really understand clearly by the word of God the relationship that Jesus as a man had to the father which was a spirit and if you can't understand that relationship then you'll never fully understand your relationship and your part in the godhead because brother brandham shows how that the bride is actually part of by expression by expression uh she's not a worshiped being but by an unfolding expression every son and daughter of God are a part of God's continuing godhead so the godhead then becomes more than just I he one is he two is he three you actually are seeing that the plan of God using the Plan of Redemption is going to have an entire Kingdom of saints of Kings and Priests and that and that and the increase of that Kingdom throughout all the ceaseless ages through the eternities unfolding by the uh by the hidden Mana the future hidden Mana that Kingdom of Christ will never cease increasing hallelujah amen so we're headed for something friends I'm here to tell you you haven't believed cunningly devised tales and these are not fables there are fables in the in the world and thank God because he knew we could he could never get us home on man-made fables so he comes in this day and he steps out of the eternities and he takes the book and he looses the Seven Seals to restore back the faith of the fathers by restoring back the original word there's only that's the only way you can have the original faith of the fathers was to have the original word because faith comes by hearing the word so we thank the Lord for this whereas he he could not come and instead of being able to come and receive a bride which he was entitled to do by the time he brother B says by the time he he's ready she's already polluted she's already uh you know married she's already in adultery and the the the Nan Council has already happened and so instead of being able to take a bride home in a Rapture Christ must sit back down in the eternities intercede over over 2,000 years intercede for ignorance see and we we showed you last time that and I and I asked it to you like this where else would he be interceding from John had not noticed him cuz he had been back there interceding he's looking for a lamb and a and he sees a lamb and so we find that he didn't see him brother brandham said he hadn't noticed him because he had been back there interceding in the eternities and I I just POS the question to you where do you imagine that he would be interceding for you in the eternities because it is in the eternities that he beholds you it is in the eternities where you began with him so in that regard you didn't actually you might have had a a birth date here on this world but before there was ever a this world you existed in the mind of God we were we were in the elected son as I've said to you many times it's it's not a doctrine of elitism that's a false charge that they charge the the redeemed of the Lord with to say oh you you talk about predestination and you talk about election and it's just elitism you think you're a you think you're a super race well I know he's a super race and I know that according to Isaiah 42 there's only one elected son and that's Christ well then how did you and I get elected because we were in him I was in Christ before the foundation of the world so when he Steps From the eternities in this day in this end time he's coming to claim the book he's coming to to bring to pass his vision of you and I he's always had a vision of you yes amen and we were showing you last time that your life has really been uh an unfolding drama of God allowing you to come in under a sin birth but watching you your whole life with a plan and a vision that couldn't be interrupted couldn't be redacted couldn't be changed couldn't be altered not enough Devil's in hell to change the vision even you can't change it and then he just kept following you and kept following you until the time appointed of the father and then it I don't know whether he brought you in a church or whether he drugg you out of a bar or whether he knocked you on your back or whatever he had to do but he made you look up and when you look up you heard an eagle scream Hallelujah and something echoed like a deep you couldn't you couldn't explain it fully nobody else quite heard it but but you heard it Hallelujah I'm here to tell you that's the same Jehovah that dwelt in the eternities so it was a voice that was inexplicably familiar to you he's coming here why did he come as we've said it's not just to increase your theology it's to have a relationship it's to know you in Redemption yes amen but it's to bring you to the Vision he had of you before the foundation of the world and so this is this should be always great news amen but unfortunately sometimes I've had to sit across in counseling with somebody whose life is absolutely devastated smashed and laying in pieces and and the whole reason is is because God had a vision of them and he won't let them go I just say Lord smash whatever you have to smash in my life rip tear burn pluck I don't care what it takes if I won't give it up take it from me so we find then that that power that comes to redeem you and I want to really make this connection today the power that redeems you and does all of that that we're talking about is the same power in Genesis amen that's Genesis power that chased you Genesis power that did whatever it had to do to get you it's Genesis power that's holding you it's Genesis power that's going to deliver you you say why do you call it Genesis power because the whole plan is to bring you back to this perfect time where God can look over the whole world with you in it and say it's good it's very good so that power is found in the same way in the same place and in the same way it's God's spoken word of command I don't have time to go into it today brother brandham dealt with it quite a bit and there is a man here who can turn on the light it's a great sermon you should go hear it where brother brandham describes the new birth using nature how that the Earth was there and the sun was there and the seed was in it but there was a Darkness between the light of the sun and the seed buried underwater so what does God do first thing he does is he starts causing the land to appear he's got a plan see and he he's got a light and and and and now he he's actually C he's going to cause light to strike seed and that's why that's why when we look at verse one in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period that's it that's all he says so I I realize that when you read the days it looks like well on this day he did this to the light and on this day but in the very first sentence in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth the Sun is already there amen the Earth is already there every seed that it'll ever have is already there but now he's got some work to do you see you came into this world with a gene of God but in between the light of God's word and your Gene there was a dark shadow called a fallen nature and so the same word that spoke here and said let there be light I command it and what did that do that separated the Darkness and Light come through and he he brought the dry land so it could strike seed God was working I'm here to tell you you became a believer because God was working it's all Grace it's all on him as I said at the beginning you owe him everything how would we not give him our whole heart and mind how would we not worship Him how would we not lift his name in Praises how would we not have a prayer life that seeks to commune with this being who's done so much and seeks to do so much more so you can see then why Satan's t itic is to always you know always to interfere with that connection always filling up your life with with a really super complicated scientific word hard to pronounce um it's it's ancient and I and and I use it on purpose Satan fills up your life with stuff I just say what is that it's yeah it's everything it just covers it all you say well can be more specific I can anything that hinders you talking to him anything that hinders you being here anything that hinders you letting your light shine or the token be on display that stuff the devil has allow has talked you into having that interferes with the Lord's Vision in your life and you will never know the joy and peace that you know exists you know it's there you know it exists it's always like a carrot just out ahead of you you know it's there but I'm here to tell you as long as you value that stuff more than you value what's on the other side of that it'll just stay there see this is the part of overcoming that's your part yes amen see he did the part you couldn't do you couldn't save yourself you couldn't bring light to the seed you couldn't annihilate your old nature you were born with it stuck with it you were as brother Donnie says chained to a dead man amen amen but God rich in Mercy see loved us and and and did that for you now it's up to you to unpack you don't say I need to pack up not to go to heaven to go in the Rapture Prophet said it's time to unpack need to unpack things that are hindering you unpack things that are limiting your spirituality unpack them so we find then that it's that same word of command that annihilated that thick darkness and allowed the sun to strike the seed whatever day that it looks like it was created that's just God working on what he's already done he's developing it he's developing you I I don't know what day you know there's no one in here except maybe some of my family that I know their birthday see but but but the real brother brandham talks about three birthdays that you've got a Earthly birthday you've got a new birth birthday and you've got a Rapture Day where you get a glorified body I I I had number one now I've got I'm enjoying the second stage and I'm looking for the third Hallelujah I'm looking to blast off I'm I'm thoroughly done with this one so so we find then that it's the same spoken word of God's spoken word of command brother brandham deals with that as I said and there is a man here that can turn on the light he really lays out the new birth properly so this new birth then brings with it its new nature it's your original nature which had been dormant it was in seed form it was there but it was dormant it had no efficacy it had no influence on you but but as I said at a time appointed of the Father the voice of God spoke to you and commanded the darkness in you see and so now that annihilated the old nature and allowed the the life that was in the seed to come forth and you're a Christian amen see you're real one you're not just one where the spirit of God has anointed your flesh or your spirit which are no matter what he would do I mean he could come down and literally put his hands on your flesh it would still keep it would still be sinful you understand you can come up under his anointing and on a platform and it'll drive Demons of disease out of you until you get outside and they'll come right back you see because this body is is dying it's of the earth it still has sin in it the only way that you'll ever get a body that doesn't have any sin is you got to have a a glorified body like under his glorious body so the nature of sin remains in the flesh and the spirit but now your spirit is Under New Management can I say it like that there's a new owner with a different Vision a different nature that comes from above this new nature now has a direct access to your still Fallen flesh see your still Fallen Spirit I'm here to tell you I I I love every one of you you're all my sweetie pies but you're you're you're without the Holy Spirit there's nothing good about you there's only one good and that's God see and so without the Holy Ghost a man is just a brute beast that's all he is he he's just a he's a fallen he was built in the image of God built to be an amateur God but he's just a brute animal see and so so we find that that this new nature of course it has a direct access to this Fallen flesh and Fallen Spirit where your memory and your reason and your conscience and your affections and your imaginations are still under a sin under the law of sin and death see so this the but fortunately by the new birth you're under a new management you've got a new nature and now Begins the greatest battle ever fought see now you're where Paul talks about in Romans 7 to will is present with me where where did you get the will to do God's Will from your soul be because the I've had a new nature change and so so Paul says to will is present with me but the problem is I still got problems going on in my flesh and so there's a battle there constantly and that's the greatest battle ever fought all right so I can't get bogged down into that in that today I want to keep moving now don't worry I'll revisit it in further Parts because we're going to continue to to to look at it so this is this is precisely why only the we say the message of the hour well it's really broader than that the message of any hour only the message of any hour you say well what is the message of any hour it's the message that Christ anoints for that day and there's only one of them and it's not varied and it's not multiple choice and it's not up for debate he sends an angel he sends a star a a a seal partially opens a mystery drops a messenger catch it and runs with it it gathers a bride around him abc123 amen it's not rocket science see and so only the message of any hour has the ability to fully accomplish redemption in the individual that that's that that that's the very reason that that's true is because the only Power of creation is the spoken word Satan cannot create amen understand so that if you want if you want Zoe life you've got to have you've got to have the very essence of Zoe himself see that comes down and and brings forth a part that he placed in you as a as a child sister Deborah is about to bring a child into the world and there's a little angel and and and and that's that's there right when it's ready to take that body but down but brother Brenham teaches us how that God takes a little deposit of himself slips it inside and so when that baby becomes a living Soul it has a dormant seed of God's life in it see and the the only way that can ever come to life is the message of any hour of whatever hour you're in that message comes across you and you hear you recognize and you begin to act on the word of God and that is what brings the new birth and I'm here to tell you that is what has always brought the new birth since the days of the Holy Ghost that's always what brought the new birth I could just I could stop right here and just go to scripture after scripture after scripture after scripture the apostles taught it unequivocally that you're Born Again by the revelation of the word to you personally Hallelujah so so that it's it's why it has to be the message of any hour and and because the spoken word of God is the original seed of life and all creation I read it for you in our opening text so so I mean think about it friends how else do you imagine God would have a kingdom where everybody are Saints amen amen we're a whole Kingdom and everybody's got the nature that Jesus had how you suppose that's going to happen if it's not for the creative power of God's word because people will decide to do [Music] better you know humanity is just going to collectively determine to become better people they they've thought that forever John Lennon thought all we need is love he's wrong now if he hadd been talking about the right love he'd have been right but he had no Revelation because he thought love was a a thing or an emotion but he didn't know love was a person and so you've got to have a change to your nature this is where we were talking about you know last time uh uh cycles and and patterns that are in our life and things that come down to us through the grab bag of life and and their you know heredity and different things and how you came and characteristics and you know your temperament and your zodiac and your raising and your what the ministry you sit under all of these things you you become the sum collection of everything you've experienced by the time God finds you you are a messed up individual that's why the best thing for you to do is stop drop and roll you're on fire and he's trying to help you quit trying to tell him how to do it just do what he says and I promise you'll get to a new birth and so you know so we have these things you know these Cycles in life and and they repeat their their they don't respect persons I mean I I remember hearing years ago when brother gidon retif was preaching on Breaking the cycle and he said it like this and you could hear thetion in his voice he said it slow he was careful and he was there in at at bible way and he said I'm just going to say this he said I hope it doesn't offend you he said but if brother Bram had not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost then he would have been a brandom see and what how did Brother Bram describe the Brams they were Fighters they were drunkards they would knife you in a second many of them died with their boots on see they were Mountain folk who were no nonsense and and and and defended their own to the death and and you and you know and if you if they would fight out in the backyard but if you caught one of them in the front yard and tried to get in a fight with him brother brandham said Brams would come from everywhere you had to fight the whole family so they they were they were a rough cob people and you know you remember when brother brandham is dealing with his own nephew and his own brother's got a son and he's married to a German lady and that German lady her whole family are snobs they won't repent they're not friendly they'll never apologize even when they're wrong he's a brandom so he come from Drinkers and bootleggers and Fighters and gamblers and adulterers remember brother brandom that's why he hated women he said because he had to pack water to the steel and he saw what those women were doing in his house you know at 3:00 and 4: in the morning and so he said I hated women he said now God took that out of me and he said gave me uh the Holy Ghost and he said now I appreciate Godly women there's nothing better that a man can have outside of his salvation than a Godly wife so so we find that that he you know he he would have been that way but he and so now he's got a son and the son has had an altar experience right like like many of us before we got a new birth we came to the altar again and again and again right we got prayed we cried we prayed prayed for we went to youth camps we did everything we could you know when I was a teenager in the church and there was such a an immature understanding of the new birth I mean the altar was just a merry go around all the young people went to it all the time it was just like this is what you do you know and the preacher gets to the end of his sermon and he starts counting 10 N8 you're terrified the rapture's coming and you're running to the Altar and you're screaming and crying and then you leave there and those were real tears I cried plenty of them but then we went right outside and I hung around and I could see what I was doing what they were doing and we weren't getting converted we we we're getting people brother R said we're getting them to church but are we getting them to Christ are we really bringing them in and showing them that this is not just Doctrine you're trying to believe or understand you might never understand all the doctrine but we're here to tell you God has done something tremendous in this day and you are invited to be a part of but it requires the giving of your whole heart mind body and soul and if you don't do that then I'm not saying God doesn't love you I'm not even saying somewhere in eternity he might find a way to save you but you're never going to be part of the first resurrection you're never going up in the Rapture you're certainly not going to be in the Millennium that's not my teaching I didn't decide that that's his teaching and we could go scripture after scripture after scripture on that as well so you know this nephew had never been born again and because of that he's arrogant he gets that from his mom you know he's he's he's he's angry he's aggressive gets that from his dad came down through the genes of of of man and woman and brother brandham says you know he needs the new birth yeah and he says Billy I know my son has has has been saved he went to the Altar and brother brandham didn't deny that he said I'm not saying that he hasn't had an experience like that but I'm saying that he's never been born again you can see that his old Fallen nature is still dominant see amen and he said and my recommen he said my recommendation would be that he never marry anybody or he'll make some good girl's life hell on Earth I'm here to tell you something sister don't chase a boy who's not born of the spirit of God because the potential for him to make your life a hell on Earth is large that's right so so he he says to his brother you know you're a Brandon but why aren't you like all of our family because of the Holy Ghost he says to the wife sister your family is arrogant won't apologize they're mean and hateful why aren't you like that you're sweet and loving and kind and humble he said because the Holy Ghost changed you see so you know he brother Bram even had to break out of that cycle of of being a br him and and he you know and God I'm glad to know God gave him his daddy at his death you know just before he died he gave his heart to the Lord and brother brandom said I held him in my arms and I I watched his curly black hair he said as his head went over his just barely in his 50s and he said he went went to be with the Lord but brother brandham got comforted later on because he saw him on the other side and the lord gave him his daddy at death and I'll I mean hey I'll take that for my loved ones if I can pray hard enough and apply a token and he'll give them to me somehow some way you know that that's fine but but but I just don't want to come in at death I Want to Be Alive Now I want to serve him now I want to account for something I want to I've been called by a great God with a great calling who has a great vision and I want to be a part of that how did you get there brother Jason one day I met a great person am and he SATs on a throne way up high and he called to me did he call to you friends oh he drew Us near didn't he my he's known us all along and think about that he he he he knew you all along and still chose you amen it's hard to believe brother the Lord would call a x Mafia Hitman but he did amen that quite a work on brother Luther amen the Holy Ghost sister Melissa or something all the above well here's the good news brother Luther he's choosing you still he he knew the mistakes I'd make last week he's still choosing me he knows I might stumble next week but I'm here to tell you he's still choosing me he doesn't regret his choice hallelujah oh my uh we had all kinds of hooks in US didn't we everything that Satan could hook onto our life we talked about that last time that's still burning in my heart my but I'm glad that I'm glad that the one who found me could do something about it oh my it's one thing I get lost in the wilderness and search and rescue comes and sends me a chopper I'm as glad as I can be to get back home to my family but but they're they can't keep me from getting lost again if I do the same stupid things I'll get lost in the same stupid way I'm glad that somebody who rescued me who could change me Hallelujah so that I don't just keep going down that path I don't even want to go down that path anymore amen he took my old Heart of Stone out and gave me a new one amen and that's and that then becomes your your your new birth nature see so I want to say it like that a lot of times we run it together too quickly and you don't you're missing the point it's a new birth nature amen you understand so so my new birth Nature has desires like God has and it and and it doesn't think like the rest of the world why am I weird because I don't I have a new birth nature why can't I just go along and go with the flow because I I don't my new birth nature won't doesn't like that see it doesn't think like the world it doesn't share the same desires as the world I don't have the same motives the same objectives I used to but I have new dreams now New Visions new motives new objectives I have new plan I have a different world view and I have a different view of the world I see the world for the poison that it is see and so I I you know I I just conclude different things I I go in a different direction I don't know I I March to the beat of a Different Drum we could go on all day describing it you know but there's all you say well what's it really about it's really about a presence dwelling deep within me that groans with all creation for the manifestation of the sons of God there's some alien life down inside of me and it it Longs for something more than this world has to offer me Longs for a clean place a presence of God you know and and and and I I wasn't I I'm not happy just to be in a Sunday to Sunday Cycle don't be satisfied get out of that cycle as brother Matt preached about the the the the the circle you know the the what do they call it the the traffic circle those things are not made for you you're going somewhere so you don't just go in a traffic circle and go around and around and around drive out of that thing you're never going to get where you're going if you're just in a circle and in a cycle don't come here in some Sunday to Sunday Cycle last Sunday I felt great this week we was no good but now I'm feeling great again break that cycle get rid of that hook let the Christ take that chain and snap it out of your life see drive out of it brother brandham is dealing with the Pentecostals there and here in 1959 he's coming with a very important sermon what is the holy ghost I mean that's a question that everybody every Christian had an opinion on now the Earth has reached a time where it's not just of some great tremendous brother or sister from a man age who could write a devotional book and try to describe and it would be a a it would be a mixed bag of accuracy and error but now finally the Earth the Lord had deployed his seventh star his seventh and last star from his right hand he had been deployed to the Earth he he was catching understanding that the world even before the seals he's still a prophet I used to love brother Homer Brown when they would ask him he'd read a quote and that somebody would say Well when did he say that you know what year was it brother brandham said that and brother Homer always was that answer the same way he would say in the year he was a prophet that's pretty okay end of argument and so he he he and I get the background versus the message coming under Malachi 4 I get that we're not trying to teach on that today but brother brandham is saying here and he's trying to get the church to understand and he says here I believe that we are so close to the coming of the Lord Jesus that it behooves us to do all that we possibly can to bring every soul to the kingdom and to bring the kingdom to the people that we might be healed of our Spirits amen so he's he's he's pointing to a problem there's a problem going on in the last day church now it's not she hasn't flatlined yet Christ is only 1959 she hasn't kicked him out yet she will see but she hasn't flatlined yet she hasn't put him out so so there's there's no need yet for Malachi 4 to take the re to to take the message of Revelation 184 say come out of her my people because that's the message after she kicks him out and then that's when Malachi 4 the spirit of Elijah is really running full force on a man who was born a prophet and now he's got a message because the the the mighty Angel has came down to the strong Angel to give him the open book and the message is now you need to come out of her before he would say get you a good church find you a good church go somewhere these men will be happy to have you in their churches uh because right now but he's but he's identifying that the church is sick 1959 Christ is only going to be welcome in the church the modern Christian Church he's only only going to be welcome for about another four years amen and so so literally the church has about 4 years to live and then it'll be completely dead see and Redemption within it is is no longer even possible salvation from destruction but Redemption no way you've got to come out and hear the message you've got to receive the word that brings the new birth see before he could bring a new birth and that because he was in The Eternity winking at ignorance well he stepped forward and he Blu the seals and now he calls all men and says you got to now come to the word Paul did the same thing that's what the Jews were trying to say hey we've got Moses and you got 1,600 years of tradition Paul who do you think you are and Paul says listen you're you're missing the point the lamb has now come the one those those offerings of animals could never make the worshipper perfect you know that as well as me you know that you came with the same desire and left with the same desire every year continually we're trying to tell you that that he was he's coming to live inside you and that during that time where you brought animal sacrifices God winked at your ignorance that's Paul's language God winked at your ignorance but now he requireth all men to do what obey Peter they asked Peter what shall we do and he says repent and Paul says you got to go back what do you do God winked at your ignorance but now he requireth all men to repent amen and accept the name of Jesus Christ and take his name in baptism and receive the Holy Ghost see so a prophet is doing the same thing at the in the omeg GA age to say yes in those ages that was he winked at ignorance Redemption was possible I know that because I know Martin Luther is in the first resurrection I know John Wesley is in the first resurrection though Martin Luther smoke and drank and Wesley preached Trinity Doctrine I know that Christ was in The Eternity winking at their ignorance you can't disbelieve what you don't know so so you know with without and Paul talks about that in the fifth chapter of Romans man I'm going to get sidetracked if I don't move on here but but but Paul talks about that when there when there is no law then then you you can't be condemned like that because you can't be found guilty of disbelieving something you don't know see so it's all about you say well then what about people who can't who can't see the message but they're good Christian people they they'll be saved they already are saved see but that doesn't mean they're redeemed they're still headed for a tribulation for their sin of unbelief and rejecting the pure word that would have given them a new birth amen see and so they will be granted eternal life it's obvious that they don't have it they're standing at the Judgment in Matthew 25 Jesus had promised if youve passed from Death To Life you'll never stand at that judgment you'll be seated with Christ on the throne so so these aren't things we're making up this is just a prophet putting scripture after scripture together and making the the case incontrovertible and so so we find here that he's showing that the church four years out of her death spiral four years shy of it is already sick and a prophet is saying in the message what is the holy ghost He we need to be healed of our Spirits the body the spiritual body of Christ on Earth is very sick he comes also in 1959 this is actually in a sermon six months prior he says this is a sick world isn't it and but we know in 1959 that was Cub Scouts that was t-ball right but you know what's the sickest body on Earth I say this with reverence not to be sacrilegious God forgive me if I say wrong the body of Jesus Christ it needs healing and it can only be healed he's talk talking about brotherly love he actually thought that was the evidence of the Holy Ghost till he got corrected by the angel it's unident it is an Evidence Divine love it's part of the package but but the real evidence is to be able from your very soul to say Amen to every word see so so we find he says that that's the sickest body I know of all broke to pieces and tore up now you good I'm at the bottom of the hour so you know me I'll take about another 20 25 minutes and we'll stop so just stay with me all right all right so he says it's the it's the body of Christ it needs healing all right and he says and you're the members of the body so God heal you physically and spiritually amen catch this make you what you should be so he's not just talking about a healing of you spiritually he's talking about a healing that will be sufficient to make you what you should be hlj and he's preaching all the Days of Our Lives so this is about your life what what is your life supposed to be there's no way you're going to get there without the baptism of the holy spirit so so you see that it's the it's the it's literally the the the bride's privilege all right now watch brother brandham comes here in the spoken word is Original Seed because you're going to see that it's the bride's privilege to point The Lost World to Christ at his coming he says as the end time prophecies will repeat I believe as the first runner came from the Wilderness and cried Behold the Lamb of God the second Forerunner will do the same and I if you're really a a good student of the message you know that when brother brandham said it here in 62 he said he will probably I took that out you know why on the authority of what he said later because when he takes this and puts it in the church age book it's not probably it's for sure see so the second Forerunner will do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride the bride of Christ will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of Jesus screaming Behold the Lamb of God so a prophet you say how did he go home and the Rapture didn't come we were all going to go together he his mission was to come and identify you to identify who the bride would be what she would look like and how she would act and how she would conduct herself he he gave the specifications so that we could know when we're part of the Bride when we're willing to say Amen to every word we can know we're part of the Bride when I'm willing to have my token on display I know I'm part of the Bride I don't need brother B to come back and tell me that or Gabriel to show up and tell me I'm highly favored he already told Mary who I'm a type who's a type of the bride and I already know I'm highly favored and so because because first of all what is Grace it's the unmar favor amen and so the the the Capstone comes crying Grace Grace unto it so I already know I'm highly favored because Grace is the favor of God see so he he says here it's the bride of Christ that will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of Jesus screaming Behold the Lamb of God so you got a mission yes you got a job to do if you're a Believer you're supposed to your life is supposed to be pointing to a Heavenly home and A Life That's Coming your life is supposed to be the final voice to the final age he says in kinsman redeemer just in case you're wondering whether you've got the tools to do that with if you do if you're if you're born again Watch what he says in the Kinsman Redeemer now Sons and Daughters who has the most power before God he's talking about a a a son and daughter of God versus an angel right he says what is an angel an angel is a servant that right they're his servants what are you his son and daughter who has the most power in heaven then a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side amen here's the answer you ready I should leave you on a cliffhanger here's the answer The Sinner that's been saved by grace has more Authority in heaven than the Archangel that stood by his side without sin why why brother because he's a son a son has more Authority than a servant yeah but you were born in sin he wasn't that just means I know God as a redeemer in a way the angel could never know him understand so so I have an opportunity to be a more complete son so an angel you know I mean if you if you look at how God operates in in the earth now look when they came to the the tomb they they there was a large Stone there that the women couldn't roll away so they needed somebody to do something that they couldn't do that they even though they were Daughters of God they couldn't roll the stone away so an angel came and rolled the stone away and Peter was in prison and he had chains on and Peter couldn't get the chains off and he couldn't open the prison doors am so what happened an angel showed up and took the chains off and opened the doors and walk and let him out see but but when it came to the house of Cornel I and the Holy Ghost was going to come and baptize people into the Holy Ghost it couldn't be an angel showing up to preach it had to be a man it had to be Peter who summoned the Holy Ghost and while he yet spake these words hallelujah it's one thing to open a prison door loose a chain you might get in another prison you might get another chain but once you've passed from Death to life there's no coming back from that Hallelujah and it took a Son of God filled with the spirit of God see it took the power of creation that operated in Peter's Ministry to to make New Creations in Christ that took a son in the image of God free of all Hooks and cycles and all everything broken and God in complete control of his life that's the that's the that's the comfort that I take that I know as long as I can I know I'm called I already know I wasn't called by my parents or by a bible school I was called by the same one that called St Paul the same one met me in the woods and I had a supernatural experience and I know I'm called to preach the gospel and I and I'm coming out here today and my life my whole life is under the blood I would never uh pick up this sacred book called handling the fires of God with with secret sin in my life and there is none and I stand Here anointed of the Holy Spirit I have power over demons I have power to break chains I have power to drive back evil spirits as I'm preaching the Holy Ghost can fall on you it can heal your body heal your mind heal your spirit give you the new birth say have you ever experienced it I it happens all the time all the timeall see so it it it it God is determined to use people amen see it it it it took it let me say it this the right way it took Hatty Wright willing to say the truth and believe what she said it there there there's nothing about some Gabriel showing up in her little cabin and saying to you two boys I'm G to force you to be born again that that who has more Authority the son or daughter of God or the angel there was no angel that came in there and did that Haddie a woman a human being born of the spirit of God and brother brandham said sister Hattie say anything I'll say it behind you and you'll have it and she said the salvation of my two sons and those boys hit their knees right then because that's what God was looking for a bride who can point to the skies at the appearing of Jesus Christ and say Behold the Lamb of God am speak the word that was Genesis power that was operating in her there was not enough devils in hell to stop it see so this is this is how God deals in your life and I know good and well you're like me we deal with the the weaknesses and the ups and downs that we we only we talk to the Lord about you know that list you know that little list that little list that only the Lord hears that we talk to him about the desires of our of our heart see we're still trapped in this awful Fallen flesh amen and you know I I was so appreciating brother Caleb's Sunday school from a couple of Sundays ago when he started talking about you know the Rahab and and she had had had a name and it was an ill-famed woman and you know if you she she kept the name but the but the word began to refer to her in a certain way that hadn't applied I mean I mean you and the other example he used there um who was it Caleb used Rahab and uh and Ruth there it was and and and Ruth was the moabitas but but then she becomes the Bride of uh here here here is Ruth Ruth and Boaz now she becomes uh the progenitor she's now in the lineage of Christ and she's going to bring that lineage forth and that's eventually going to get to Jesse and Jesse's and and we're going to find that it's going to go all the way down to to the seed line of Christ see and the same thing with Rahab who married General salmone and then you get Boaz and so brother Caleb tracked it all all back and and that reminded me because I had this point in my notes and I said wow isn't that amazing because psalms 14:7 now watch Psalms 14:7 oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion when the Lord bringeth back the Captivity of his people Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad see it's a Messianic prophecy that one day he's coming and Israel is going to be redeemed as a nation in one day see and but but if you'll notice here that it's representing a coming Nation and and and he was called Israel but he was still Jacob am see and this isn't the only place you would think that once the angel said your name will no longer be Jacob but it's Israel because Jacob meant a Shyer and Israel meant a prince you'd think they'd have never referred to him as Jacob again you'd think that that would have been erased from the annals of heaven and his name Jacob would have never been mentioned again ever and here it is hundreds and hundreds of years years later and David under inspiration is still calling him Jacob but also admitting he's Israel and also admitting this is the seed line you see friends oh my his Spirit had been healed from being a Shyer and now he was given the name to be fit a nature of a prince God had done a work in him but he was still Jacob and and and yet he would be a part of the coming Kingdom and being God's family because look I I I know I'm still me and I know I know I've still got faults but I am part of a kingdom I know I get it I know I'm a Son of God I know I get a new name but I'm still me I've still got this old flesh and and and and and I'm going to be me until I get out of here but I am getting out of here hallelujah because why I've surrendered to a new nature oh my my I'm part of that same Kingdom I got to find a place to close we talked about how that the you know the Passover was a cycle that never dealt with the sin of the believer uh whereas you know the baptism of the Holy Ghost was literally the advantage of the true Sabbath see not a day on a calendar but the advantage of the true Sabbath would be the holy spirit and that that would literally pass me from Death unto life and I would never come back to having that sinful nature again ever forever I would never have it again and so I I just I thought about that this morning and I thought well Lord I I might still have ups and downs and I'm I'm still trapped in a body that makes mistakes but at least I'm that far sir at least I've passed from death into life you ought to be thankful for that today and just say at least I'm that far I know I'm still battling but but I but I I don't yet have a body that's free of Temptations but I am that far hallelujah how far are you I have no more desire of sin all the desire of the world has gone from me I am that far Hallelujah so a messenger was sent in our day see wow there for get all of this so a messenger is sending our day no I'm done stand up amen no it's just too important to preach to you when you're starting to get tired and I can feel it amen praise the Lord I probably geared you that way it's probably my fault but amen but amen I love the Lord don't don't you amen that's a tough spot to be in but I I I I think and trust and hope that I've used the better part of wisdom amen praise the Lord I want you to Bow your heads with me over the building this morning yeah amen let's talk to the Lord Lord I sure am grateful to you this morning you know the the the way my mind was this morning trying to figure and trying to encapsulate how do I say all of this how do I make it clear and Lord you've just built me as you've built me I am what I am and I I have to feel like I'm being clear if I feel like I'm confusing the people Lord it'll just give me a nervous breakdown I can't preach like that I I'm sorry that I go so slow and so methodical but you've built me as you've built me and so there it is so today Lord I I I feel in my heart that we can just stop right there I think enough has been [Music] said Lord enough has been said that every man and woman ought to have a ought to feel afraid fresh desire for more of you there ought to be Lord there's been enough said today and explained in a way that people realize that that there's hope for them that you are possible that that an experience with you is doable that you could be a possibility in their life Lord and maybe we've said it in such a way today that people who felt overwhelmed and felt like I just I don't think I can be that I don't think I could ever get there maybe to today it's been shown in a way that they could leave here with New Hope a new feeling in their heart Lord to say I believe I can make it after all Lord I commit this audience into your hands today Lord with what has been said May each and every person and Lord and may it start with me may I have a fresh feeling in my own heart today Lord along with these people when we look into the word of God and we see these things my goodness it is so magnificent it is so clear it is so beautiful it is so alluring oh we just want more and more of it Lord more and more of it so I'm I'm committing that to you today Lord you look down into our lives right now Lord God oh I just raise up both my hands and surrender let whoever wants to join me raise up their hands and surrender say Lord if there's anything whatever not if whatever is in me that's not like you oh God take take it take it from us today give us that pure heart that pure mind that pure love that pure desire Lord let that desire
