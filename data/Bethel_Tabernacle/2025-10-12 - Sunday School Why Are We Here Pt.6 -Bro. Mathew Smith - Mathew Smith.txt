Sunday School: Why Are We Here? Pt.6 -Bro. Mathew Smith
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Father, that will give us a light on the inside when there's darkness all around. Father, we ask you would be with us this morning. Anoint the words that we're going to read. anoint the the scripture that we're going to partake of that Father that Lord that we could read the text, we could read the letters, we could feed on the text, but Lord, without your spirit providing the context, Father, we would be truly lost. So Lord, we ask that you would come down and anoint our hearts, anoint our minds, anoint my lips, and allow me to step out of the way and allow you to speak through me. We ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. want to turn um as a scripture um to Matthew's gospel um and we're going to look at chapter 18 and verse 15. This is um I'm going to continue my thought um the series that I've been kind of taking called Why Are We Here? And um this is Matthew 18 and verse1 15 says, "Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone. If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother." But if he will not hear hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church. But if he neglects to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. You all can be seated. So I want to um so one of the things that I'm you know last last week I talked about love and love being you know we're called to be love uh to love one another that you if you do not love the brethren then you basically haven't passed from death into unto life. That's the scripture from I believe um uh uh first John. And um we want to talk a little bit about what that means specifically because a lot of pe a lot of times people have this notion that love is something that um there is no uh love is kind of soft and passive and doesn't have any confrontation or backbone to it. &gt;&gt; Right? That love is just oh we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. We don't want to rock the boat and and we don't want to you know if you love somebody that you can't say anything that might contradict the way they feel. And unfortunately or rather fortunately that's wrong. Love is very confrontational if it is if the truth is on the line. Right? You cannot if if somebody when truth is on the line love has to speak for the truth because you can't love somebody and not allow them to live in a lie. &gt;&gt; Okay? and everybody, you know, there's I I saw a a meme of it's just the scripture, you know, so this is how people read the scripture a lot of times and it's the scripture that says judge not lest you be judged and then the rest of the scripture is crossed out, right? It's like no, that's not how that works. You read the rest of the scripture too, right? There's a, you know, the, you know, it doesn't mean that um, you know, if you read that Jesus is saying, you know, don't be a hypocrite. Don't go trying to help your brother when you have massive, massive problems of your own. You need to, you know, get the beam out of your own eye. But that doesn't mean that you just let your brethren stumble into bear traps willy-nilly. When you see, you know, it's a kind of a a famous military proverb that when you see your enemy making a mistake, don't interrupt them. Right? Well, if you see your friends making a mistake and you don't interrupt them, &gt;&gt; you've treated them like an enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? You know, that doesn't mean that you just go blasting people for the for their, you know, places where you see them making a mistake. But that means you go to them privately and you pull them aside and say, "Hey, you know, out of love here, I love you. I don't want to see you make this mistake." You know, if me and Brother Luther are walking through the woods &gt;&gt; and he sees me just walking along my path and he sees a bear trap out in front of me that I'm going to step in &gt;&gt; and he just goes, "Oh, well, you know, I just I don't want to rock the boat. I don't want to, you know, do I don't want to judge. You know, he's choosing his own path in life and I just don't want to I don't want to judge him. I don't want to Yeah. Well, I'm not going to feel very loved when I step in that bear trap. &gt;&gt; Amen. when I when my legs broken and I'm looking at him going, "You knew this was going to happen and you said nothing. &gt;&gt; You didn't. That's not love, &gt;&gt; right? That is a that is a very complicated complex form of hatred that gives the hateful plausible deniability, right? It's, you know, love when when there's conflict, you know, you know, like people want to reread that scripture and they'll read it like this. You know, moreover, if that brother shall trespass against thee, say nothing, do nothing about it. Let it fester in your heart. Let it slowly build up bitterness. Let it constantly plague your mind that that brother did you wrong and that you never dealt with it and he he never apologized for it. And it's just going to sit there and rot. And every time he does something that could even possibly be interpreted as contrary, you're going to attribute that to his rotten nature that you know he has because he did you wrong and you never dealt with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? And that's what happens. Go to your brother. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. Right? Don't put things just don't just bury stuff. You know it talks about you know love covers matter. Right? You know, you know, love doesn't, you know, you know, in Proverbs it says that, you know, love, love hides things. Well, that's why you go to him in private. &gt;&gt; Go to him oneon-one. Don't make it a big public show. Don't go, you know, blast him in public over something. Go to him in in private and say, "Hey, you know, we're we're we're brothers and I need to talk to you." You know, and more often than not, and everybody knows this, but more often than not, you know, he didn't mean it. It was an accident. Nobody meant anything by it, you know. No, it was if you if you just talk about it, you'll see it'll expose the devil's just trying to drive a wedge in the unity of the church, &gt;&gt; right? He's trying to break up the the fellowship that the people have by co by by causing misunderstandings and hurt feelings. So, it's important that we do these things because if you don't, you're going to get disease. You're going to get spiritual disease running through the church. You're going to get spiritual rot. And the exact same thing and obviously we know this also um on on the flip side of this I I want to say this before I move on from this. Um uh on the other side of this if your brother comes to you and says hey you you did something that hurt my you know that I I took offense to you know you there's there's some conflict there. you're not also going to be the person who's going to, you know, stand your ground and well, brother, I think you're just being ridiculous and I'm going to, you know, blast you with all my scriptures that I have to justify my actions. Like, no, take what they said into account, have a discussion about it. Operate with some love and kindness. You know, having a a a proud spirit and being stiff necked and refusing to even consider taking correction from your brother is the sin of Cain, &gt;&gt; right? That's the path of Cain. Brother Brandham said that the reason why Cain hated Abel is because Cain Abel had a revelation of serpent seed which in that context really is saying something, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Right? When Cain goes to Abel and says, "Abel, why are you making a blood sacrifice?" And Abel says, "Well, Cain, uh, here's why. &gt;&gt; There's some stuff you don't know about mom and dad." You know, Cain didn't like that too much. And he sure wasn't going to let, you know, somebody say that about his mama, right? So that I mean that's where this goes. So, you know, you don't when when your brother comes to you, you don't. Now, that doesn't mean that you just, you know, people can just make railing accusations against you, have to roll over and die. You know, you still have to stand with the word, but that doesn't mean that you just get your hackles up anytime somebody said, you know, says that there was an offense there. You know, you you operate with love. And this whole this whole thing this whole my whole point is that this is causing people cause having disagreements and misunderstandings and and having conflict. All human beings if people who love each other especially the people who love each other the most are going to have conflicts. You're going to have you're going to butt heads. Human nature is just that way. You're not going to be eye to eye on every single point and but it requires you to be able to to have that conversation, have that discussion with actual genuine love in your heart and and putting the truth in the word of God as the ultimate priority in that conversation. You know, especially in marriages, we, you know, it's it's kind of it's the cliche that husbands and wives fight, right? Husbands and wives never understand each other. And it's mostly biological, right? human men will never understand women and the magic that is the female mind. &gt;&gt; And women are going to be absolutely befuddled by how men come to the conclusions that they come to. &gt;&gt; And that's that's fine. It's because God separated the feminine out of Adam, right? There's there's he doesn't have the same hardware and software that you have, sister. And sister, you know, brother, she's doesn't think like you. She's never going to and if she did start thinking with exactly like you, there would be a problem, &gt;&gt; right? That's probably something she should see the doctor about the I mean this is I don't want to get too bogged down in there, but you you look at the science of why women think the way that they do and there is a whole host of reasons why they do it and I promise you you wouldn't like it if they didn't think that way. &gt;&gt; Right? So, &gt;&gt; but it requires it requires men to treat their wives like Christ treats the church. &gt;&gt; And when they when the wife comes to them and has something wants to talk to them, they don't just dismiss them as, you know, don't just handwave their problems away. Oh, you're being you're making a mountain out of a molehill. You're you know, I I this is this is a a great example of this. I want to turn just I'll just read because it's just to save the save some time. This is Esther the book of Esther chapter 5 and verse one. Now it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house. And the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house. And it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight. And the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter. Then said the king to her, what wilt thou Queen Esther, and what is thy request? It shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom. And Esther answered, if it seem good unto the king, let the king and Hmon come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him. So everybody knows the story. Esther gets notified by Mori. Hey, there's been a plot against you and your entire people. They're going to kill us all. you need to go talk to the king and get this resolved. You're the only person who's gonna have his ear on this matter. And she tells Morai, "More, you don't understand. I don't think this guy even loves me anymore. He hasn't talked to me in a month, right? He's so caught up in his business and his whatever it is that he's doing. He He literally hasn't even talked to me in a month. I don't like if I walk in there, he's just going to kill me, right? To go to the king uninvited is to death sentence." And Mori is like, "Listen, God put you in the situation. You need to go talk to him." Like if God put you like God put you in the situation for a reason. God put made you wife of the king for a reason. And so she plucks up her courage and she puts on her royal robes and she goes to the king and she faces death, right? She walked walking through those doors uninvited. There was a large Persian man standing there with a big axe and if she did not get recognition from the king, she was going to die where she stood. And she walked in there and she faced down all of that. And when she had the ear of the king and he's like, Esther, my darling, my queen, I'm so sorry I haven't made time for you. I've been very caught up in my business. What can I do for you? Whatever you want up to the half of my kingdom. Whatever you want. Whatever I can do for you, I'll do it right now. And she's like, um, can we go to dinner? The thing that she wanted, she didn't even have the courage to say. She faced death and then when it came time to reveal herself emotionally to her husband, she chickenened out. and went, "Uh, I can't do it. I need to build some rapport with you again because I haven't talked to you in a month. We've they've just life has gotten crazy and we haven't had some time to build the emotional connection. So, I have to invite you to dinner a couple of times and sit down and have a conversation so that when I talk to you, I'm confident that you're not going to treat my problems like they're a joke." This is what husbands and wives do. Husbands get caught up in their in their in in what the things that they're doing. You've got a lot of things to do. You've got businesses to run. You've got how, you know, bills to pay and mouths to feed and all the stuff you and mowing the lawn and and and you know, my car is broken and I've got all this stuff to do. And you get caught up in all of your business that you don't take time to set some time aside for your wife and remind her that you guys are married, right? Make her remember that you still love her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Make her realize that because she has a biology that you don't have. &gt;&gt; Her her system like her her brain recycles on a regular basis. And if you don't take that into account, men have this thing of like, "Oh, well, I told you once, you know, that I love you once when we got married, and if it changes, I'll tell you." No, man. You have to. That's a constant thing. Could you imagine if God gave you a a spiritual experience once and then never again? &gt;&gt; No. We come to church all the time looking for a fresh outpouring of the spirit. What do you think that is? It's the natural typing the spiritual. God made women this way because it's the pattern of how the church is to God. Right? It's the natural typing the spiritual. Husbands, that's what you signed up for when you got married. If you didn't like that, if that's too much for you, you shouldn't have got married. Right? I mean, that's just the reality. And so, you know, it's it's our job as men to recognize that your wife needs to have the emotional connection because what's going on? Here's what could have happened. If Hazardous is sitting there dealing with all of his big lofty ambitions and then Esther comes in there and is like, "Can we go to dinner?" And he's like, "Really? You bothered me over that?" Well, okay, fine. I'll put it on the schedule for next week. Whatever. We'll figure it out. And then you forget. And then, yeah, then she's going to die. You She's got something in her heart. Most of the time the wives have are carrying burdens in their heart that is going that is it's the fate of your marriage is at stake. They're carrying something that they need to feel secure to tell you the same way that we do with God all the time. We carry burdens that for whatever reason we we don't give to God, right? We carry burdens of, you know, whatever it is. And half the time we either we either think it's not important to God or we think that it's our own fault. So God's not responsible. So we're not going to bother God to tell God about it. We have all these different reasons why we won't go to God with our burdens. And so it never gets brought up. So I mean Esther's just doing the exact same thing, right? Esther's doing the same thing. She's going to a hazardous and she's trying to build a connection so she can feel safe that this massive thing that she's dealing with that if he doesn't deal with it, she's going to die, right? And but it takes her some time to build a connection with him again just to tell her what's tell him what's on her heart. So it you know it but it's on us as men to be Christ in this situation. When your wife comes to you with a problem, even if it seems insignificant, don't dismiss it. Hey, what's your what's your what's your problem? Because probably that's not the problem. probably there's something else going on that she's not telling you that you need to woo her, remind her that you're married so that she can deal with the actual problem. You know, if if Anyways, I feel like I'm repeating myself a lot here. Maybe someone needed to hear this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Likewise, wives, if you've got a problem, don't sit there and let it fester. &gt;&gt; Go to your husband. Even though the devil will sit there and tell you he's not going to take it seriously and he's going to dismiss you and he's not going to treat your problems like they're meaningful, go to him. Let him do his job. &gt;&gt; Go let do your part. Be Esther. Be Esther. Right. &gt;&gt; I I was just reading this is completely We're going off road here. This ain't in my notes. Um, there is a a story when David is running from Saul and he's got his men and he's looking he goes to a man named uh Nabal and he asks him for supplies and Nabal's like, "Ah, get out of here. You're a renegade. I don't want nothing to do with you." And then his wife recognized knowing who David is like, "My husband's going to get us all killed." And so she um packs up a bunch of dinner and goes to David. It's like, "I'm sorry. Don't listen to him. He's crazy. Take the food." And he smooths everything over. Well, when she gets back, Nabal hears what she did and he has a heart attack and dies over it. And then eventually Abigail, the the wife, ends up married to David. I tell you this story because to illustrate a point, sisters, inside of every man is a Nabal and a David, right? One of them is a scoundrel and one of them is very noble and loves you very much. If you appeal to the David in him, it will kill the Nabal. Okay? Appeal to the noble side of it. Treat him like he's David. If you treat him like he's Nabal all the time, then that's what he'll be, &gt;&gt; right? That's what he'll be. Appeal to the David even when because David really didn't have a right to do what he did. He just showed up and demanded food, &gt;&gt; right? I mean, that's kind of a kind of an arrogant way to approach things. But if you respond like Abigail, you'll get a noble side of him. You'll get a a caring cuz David I mean what David said about her at the end of it when she came came to him and he was David was blown away. He's like this woman is like nothing I've ever seen before. This woman is incredible. He I mean he he treated like he was just absolutely floored because of what she was willing to do. she was willing to be submissive in even when she didn't really necessarily have an obligation to. But that's that's kind of the calling here that sisters go to your husband even when it's when you're afraid that he's going to be dismissive. Even when you're afraid that he's going to be, you know, he's going to be nabal and and dismiss you and be like, I I'm gonna deal with your problems. You can deal with this yourself or, you know, just and he's just gonna treat your problems like they're nothing. No, go to appeal to his David side, right? Go treat him. Do it anyways. Don't just sit there and let it fester because it's going to hurt you. It's This is how gang green starts, right? I said earlier that the the saying sunlight's the best disinfectant. That's an old old military um uh first aid proverb that when you get shot and there's not access to good antibiotics and good back in the day, you know, back before antibiotics, you go leave the wound unbandaged out in the sun and let the sunlight blasted with the ultraviolet rays because it kills bacteria, right? the sun, you know, that's why they put UV lights in hospital uh ventilation systems because ultraviolet light, sunlight is lethal to infection and it's a, you know, go when don't just let things lay in your heart, don't let things when there's a problem in your marriage that one party seems to be oblivious of or if they aren't oblivious of it, um, aren't dealing with, you've got to go to your brother. Don't it don't like I said the things that are a part of the the the way the church operates and the unity of the church are just an extrapolation an expansion of the way the home operates right if you see problems in your home you see conflict in your home you somebody's got some hurt feelings do not lay let that lay there unressed &gt;&gt; don't do it this is how you get long-term problems &gt;&gt; you let go put some sunshine on it go be proactive and expose the devil trying to make an infection there. If you don't, you're going to have a problem in the long run that you can't just fix, &gt;&gt; right? So, man, I spent a lot more on that than I had intended. Um, I'll end with this. I got a couple more minutes here. You know, this extends wonder if I can bite this off in a few minutes. All right. So, when as a dad, as I'm this is a frequent experience of mine that my baby oftentimes wakes up exactly like her father, which is screaming and angry that they're awake. Not really. I don't wake up screaming, but I do wake I don't like waking up. I like to sleep anyways. But she wakes up angry and she's screaming and she's crying and I go in there. I pick her up and I'm trying to console her and do all the things that I know that I can do that usually makes her happy, but it doesn't work. And she's angry and she's screaming. She will not be pacified in any way, shape, or form. And it's because that baby needs something that I, as a dad, cannot give her. Mom can but dad cannot. Right? And it's because mom has some biology that dad does not have. &gt;&gt; Right? She's built for it. I'm not. But this is why this is the natural typing the spiritual in the book of revelations when Christ is walking amongst the golden candlesticks and it talks about being girded about the paps with a gird golden girdle. Brother Brandham clearly taught that that is the that is an indication that it is God manifested in his bride at the end time that it shows a feminine form. There's a feminine aspect to Christ in the golden candlesticks. That's God operating through his bride. And because what happens is so many times it's not just husbands and wives that have problems. Sometimes it's kids. Children have hard hard questions. Children have difficult issues that they're dealing with. Even if they're small issues, small problems are big problems to small people. Okay? It might be something simple to you, but it's a big thing to them. Or maybe they're a little bit older. They're 10, 12, 13. And it's not a small question. It's something like, "Dad, I don't understand how there can be a God if children and innocent people can be tormented. If there's so much evil in the world, how can a loving God allow that to happen?" And kids as young as 10, 12, and 13 have those kinds of questions. And if you're not somebody that they are comfortable going to and being knowing that you're going to be Christ, God with skin on it, right? that you're going to have some flesh that the pillar of fire just doesn't have. To be the God with skin on it who can who can deal with their problems and be there for them when they have big questions like that of dad, I don't understand the message. I don't I I don't I don't believe this. I don't feel it in my heart. Dad, I don't have the desire to be a Christian. If you're not there, if you're not God with skin on it in that moment, you're failing to provide for your family. That's why God put you there. So that when those children have those kinds of problems, you're going to be there to deal with it. You're gonna have the biology that the pillar of fire doesn't have. There's some things that the pillar of fire can't do. Not without skin. Not without some badger skins around it. &gt;&gt; You know, exactly. There ain't no hands but your hands. There's no hands to hold that that hurting child except for your hands. That's why God put you there. And if we as parents can't be there for our kids when they get to that level, when they get hurt, when there is some emotional damage, listen, there is so many times kids get hurt badly, really badly, things that that you know, I don't even want to get into right now and are dealing with issues. Listen, I have seen with my own eyes kids as young as 12 being suicidal. And if you can't be God with skin on, if you can't be so loving that those kids that are hurting can come to you and know that mom and dad are going to love them and not just dismiss them, and they're probably not going to come to you with, "Hey, dad, I'm having suicidal ideiation. Can you fix that?" No. They're going to come at you sideways because they're trying to figure out if you're going to love them still. you know, they're going to approach their parents in a way that isn't going to be direct. So, it's on you to treat their small problems like their big problems because that's the only way you're going to open the door to their big problems. You've got to be God with skin on it. You've got to be the the you're the first version of God they're ever going to see. You're the first. If they can't come to you with any problem that they would go to God with, then what are you? Amen. &gt;&gt; They any problem that they can go to God with, they should be able to go to you with first. And then if you don't have the answer, cuz we're humans, too. Parents are humans, too. We're not going to have all the answers. When your kid comes to you with something that you ain't never even heard of before, but it is some What are you supposed to do? You show them how you would do it. You put your arm around them and you go on your knees and you pray together. &gt;&gt; You show them the way that they should go when you're when they're old enough to not have you around anymore. That's that's that's in morphe. That's God putting on a mask, &gt;&gt; you know. That's that's what it means to let God wear have the biology of the Holy Ghost, you know. And I know we feel inadequate. I know we feel like we're not cut out for this. And it's way more than what we can handle. But you know, God chose to build his tabernacle out of badger skins. &gt;&gt; They're not the little black and white badgers of England. That's not what was in the Middle East when they were making badger getting badger skins for the tabernacle. Talking about honey badgers. These things are it's like the African version of a wolverine. They're ferocious and they smell bad. They're brutal and they're nasty. They run lions off of carcasses. But that's what God chose to wrap his Holy Spirit in. That's what God chose to wrap around the holiest of holies. And we feel inadequate. We don't feel like what we're that we're supposed to we can do that. We look at our badger skin and say that's not God. You're right. But God's inside of it. And if you just don't get so caught up in that, you can be God for somebody. And it might not be your kids. Maybe it's somebody else's kids. Maybe it's, you know, maybe it's just some sinner that you met. I don't know. But that's what it means. That's what we're called to. Anyways, I got to I'm way over time. Let's stand and and have a word of prayer. Father, I come before you with dismissing these people. Lord, something that could have be said, these stammering lips and the foolishness of this preaching, Lord, that something could have been said that would encourage somebody, would give someone a a light to to guide them through the darkness. Father, that we could hold to your promise that you would be living through us when the time came. That when we would face our greatest trials, that you would be the everpresent help inside of us, living through us. We ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you would be with us throughout this service and into the worship service that our hearts would be open. Be with us father in Jesus precious name. Amen.
