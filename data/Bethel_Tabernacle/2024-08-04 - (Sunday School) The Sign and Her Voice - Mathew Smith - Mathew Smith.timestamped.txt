[7:12] that people would hear what they the
[7:14] word that you would have for them this
[7:17] morning
[7:21] Father you come when you're
[7:24] invited we ask these things in the name
[7:26] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:28] amen um if you would turn to Genesis
[7:32] Chapter
[7:37] 18 and uh start at verse
[7:53] one it
[7:57] says um we'll just read the first three
[7:59] verses says and and then all y'all can
[8:01] sit down and says and the Lord appeared
[8:02] unto him in the plains of mamry and he
[8:05] sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the
[8:09] day and he lifted up his eyes and looked
[8:13] and lo three men stood by him and when
[8:16] he saw them he ran to meet them from the
[8:18] tent door and bowed himself toward the
[8:21] ground and said my Lord if now I found
[8:25] favor in thy sight pass not away I pray
[8:27] thee from thy servant y'all be
[8:31] seated
[8:33] um I'm going to kind of skip down and
[8:36] keep reading some verses um and just
[8:39] kind of do a quick overview of the
[8:41] chapter and it says I'm going to skip
[8:42] down to verse n and it says uh and they
[8:46] said unto him where is Sarah thy wife
[8:48] and he said behold in the tent and he
[8:52] said I will certainly return unto thee
[8:56] according to the time of life and lo
[8:58] Sarah thy wife Sha's son and Sarah heard
[9:01] it in the tent door which was behind him
[9:04] now Abraham and Sarah were old and well
[9:06] stricken in age and it ceased to be with
[9:08] Sarah after the manner of women
[9:10] therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[9:12] saying after I am waxed old shall I have
[9:15] pleasure with my Lord being old also and
[9:18] the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did
[9:20] Sarah laugh saying shall I of aury bear
[9:23] a child which I'm
[9:25] old is anything too hard for the Lord
[9:30] at the time appointed I will return unto
[9:32] thee according to the time of life and
[9:33] Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied
[9:37] saying I laugh not for she was afraid
[9:40] and he said nay but thou did
[9:43] laugh skipping down to 23 says and
[9:46] Abraham Drew near and said wilt thou
[9:49] also destroy the righteous with the
[9:51] wicked per Adventure there be 50
[9:53] righteous within the city wilt thou also
[9:56] destroy and spare not the place for the
[10:00] 50 righteous that are
[10:03] therein um that there be far uh that be
[10:07] far from thee to do this to do after
[10:09] this manner to slay the righteous with
[10:11] the wicked and that the righteous should
[10:13] be as the wicked that be that be far
[10:16] from thee shall not the judge of all the
[10:18] Earth do
[10:20] right um and then finally verse uh
[10:25] 32 um and he said oh let not the Lord be
[10:28] angry and I will speak yet but this once
[10:31] per Adventure 10 shall be found there
[10:35] and he said I will not destroy it for
[10:37] 10's
[10:39] sake and the Lord went his way as soon
[10:42] as he had left communion with Abraham
[10:44] and Abraham returned unto his
[10:47] place
[10:50] um
[10:52] I kind of what inspired this thought was
[10:56] um was actually
[11:00] um I was doing some reading and there
[11:03] was actually historically um there
[11:06] was um well let me let me just start it
[11:10] like this so a lot of times people have
[11:11] questions about the American legal
[11:14] system in regards to a lot of times you
[11:15] see some news story or something where
[11:17] some guy does something you know heinous
[11:21] and everybody knows he's guilty he knows
[11:23] he's guilty everyone knows he's guilty
[11:25] the judge knows the prosecutor knows the
[11:27] defense attorney knows
[11:29] he he's wrong and he's guilty and he
[11:31] needs you know to suffer the penalty of
[11:33] of the crime and yet there's some sort
[11:35] of technicality someone didn't dot an
[11:37] eye or cross a tea on some legal
[11:39] document somewhere and the guy walks
[11:41] right and he's and he's gets scot-free
[11:44] goes off scot-free because of a
[11:47] technicality even though everybody knows
[11:49] he did it and a lot of people kind of
[11:51] like well this is kind of seems like
[11:52] it's a it's a corrupt thing right like
[11:54] it doesn't seem that doesn't seem just
[11:55] it doesn't seem fair that doesn't seem
[11:58] like a good thing at all
[12:00] all and you know the the instinct is to
[12:03] say well we should really you know
[12:05] tighten down on on the protections that
[12:08] we give the accused because it seems
[12:09] like it's too easy to get away with
[12:12] things but if you look at the the
[12:14] history of the American legal system it
[12:16] was designed specifically to protect the
[12:19] accused right it was built and it's
[12:21] based off of this thing this uh I
[12:23] believe it was in the 1500s it was
[12:24] actually based off of a what they call
[12:26] blackstone's Theory which is a a old
[12:29] legal scholar from back in the 1500s
[12:31] named William Blackstone who he famously
[12:35] said his theory was that if you're going
[12:37] to that the legal system should um be
[12:41] set up um to protect the accused because
[12:44] it's better that a hundred guilty people
[12:46] walk free than one innocent person is
[12:49] punished right it is always it and he
[12:52] said he said his reason for that he says
[12:53] because there's always going to be
[12:54] another crime someone else is going to
[12:56] do something wrong there's always going
[12:58] to be another guilty person to
[12:59] punish but you got to protect the
[13:01] innocent because that's rare right
[13:04] that's that's something worthy of
[13:07] protecting and the reason his basis for
[13:09] this right this is and this is you know
[13:11] really kind of makes
[13:13] you kind of look back and think you know
[13:15] people in history were were a different
[13:17] different breed you know different
[13:20] higher kind of person because his basis
[13:22] for this his entire basis for this legal
[13:24] theory was Genesis Chapter
[13:27] 18 because he said the nature of God was
[13:31] one who would not punish the innocent
[13:33] with the guilty that he could look at
[13:35] Sodom and know that that City needed to
[13:38] be absolutely wiped off the face of the
[13:40] Earth and here's Abraham bargaining with
[13:43] God just begging plee you know working
[13:45] him if there's just 10 left there's just
[13:47] 10 and you would think well you know who
[13:50] would
[13:51] have you know when God you know if you
[13:54] were met face to face with God in person
[13:55] he says hey I'm going to destroy the
[13:57] city you know who would think okay this
[13:59] is Jehovah in the flesh am I going to
[14:01] sit here and try to talk him out of
[14:03] it right I'm going to talk him out of it
[14:06] and
[14:08] yet Abraham could do it and God would go
[14:12] along with everything Abraham said
[14:14] because God already had a plan for this
[14:16] situation right God's you know it's kind
[14:18] of like I don't know if you ever have
[14:20] you know you're going to you are you get
[14:21] in your mind you're going to do
[14:22] something nice for somebody like your
[14:23] wife or your kids or something or your
[14:24] friend and you're going to do something
[14:26] nice for them and they ask you hey will
[14:28] you do this thing for me and You'
[14:30] already planned you were going to do it
[14:32] you
[14:33] know God had already had a plan God
[14:36] wasn't going to punish anybody because
[14:38] if if all right so look if if it would
[14:39] have been left up to Abraham then God
[14:41] would have had total justification to
[14:43] wipe out 10 innocent people with the
[14:45] rest of the city
[14:47] right and lot and his family would have
[14:50] been toast because only three made it
[14:53] out right lot and his family made it way
[14:55] under the
[14:56] threshold so but God's plan plan was
[14:59] that zero innocent people were going to
[15:00] be punished right there were going to be
[15:02] none he was going to make sure they were
[15:04] out before the city burned
[15:07] right because God won't allow the
[15:09] innocent to be punished with the guilty
[15:11] because he's a God of Justice he's he's
[15:14] he can't I mean it would be so contrary
[15:18] to God's nature to to destroy an
[15:20] innocent person with the
[15:25] guilty but all humanity is guilty on on
[15:29] some level right all humanity is guilty
[15:32] on some level and so God knowing
[15:37] this had to perform a great
[15:40] Injustice because he would he would
[15:42] punish an innocent person for the sake
[15:45] of all of humanity right that there
[15:47] would have to be one
[15:49] person who would have to completely
[15:52] innocent would ultimately be punished
[15:54] for the for sins of all Humanity right
[15:57] and that Christ
[15:59] stepping into that role right that God
[16:02] looking down at Humanity in love
[16:05] saying this is not a place for justice
[16:09] this is a place for love this is a place
[16:11] for for Grace this is a place for that
[16:14] that no angel could do this you know
[16:18] it's like you know brother Bram tells
[16:20] the story of of of the the um the three
[16:24] three Hebrews in the fiery furnace that
[16:26] how God looking over the bandits or
[16:27] seeing these the his children about to
[16:29] be burnt you know and all the Angels
[16:31] coming up with their oh we can flood
[16:32] them out you know worm would all destroy
[16:34] them with a flood and you know the other
[16:36] you know I'll rain fire from the heavens
[16:38] and and God says no this is a man-sized
[16:41] job right this is a job that only a man
[16:44] could
[16:45] do and the ultimate goal of
[16:48] this the ultimate
[16:51] goal of this Grace was not simply just
[16:54] to make
[16:56] the the guilty innocent for a Time
[16:59] you know
[17:01] because if the if if God just you know
[17:04] if if you just got a a one-off
[17:06] pardon well tomorrow you will fail again
[17:10] amen right it's gonna it's the the
[17:12] purpose of of Christ dying was not
[17:15] simply to wipe your sins away
[17:18] because eventually you will fail again
[17:21] it the the purpose was to allow you to
[17:24] have a new
[17:25] life which we man I I I
[17:29] I I just so wish that I could say this
[17:32] the way it came to me the in if we read
[17:35] you know Genesis Chapter 18 all this is
[17:38] built right there in the story right um
[17:43] maybe I should just I'm just going to
[17:44] read this quote and kind
[17:47] of so this is from
[17:51] um the voice of the
[17:54] sign 1964 and it
[17:57] says um and Jesus said uh that would
[18:01] return again now remember Abraham called
[18:02] that man Elohim
[18:05] god
[18:07] um God he would he would have to be why
[18:11] he could discern the thoughts and he was
[18:13] exactly on time and Elohim the god or
[18:16] the Holy Ghost not another person the
[18:18] same person returning into the church
[18:20] would do the same thing that would be
[18:22] the sign and the voice would be call
[18:25] them back to the word restore the faith
[18:28] of the children to the fathers there is
[18:31] the sign and the
[18:33] voice signs are usually accepted but the
[18:37] voice is not they don't like the voice
[18:40] but they'll take the sign usually
[18:42] they'll take it they like the sign
[18:44] because they like to look at it
[18:45] entertains them but the voice they don't
[18:48] want to do it remember now the voice and
[18:51] then I'm going to skip down um a
[18:54] paragraph and it says um turn back to
[18:56] the word again Jesus's sign of the
[18:58] Messiah according to Isaiah 35 the lame
[19:01] show leap like a heart and all this that
[19:04] was wonderful oh they accepted that that
[19:06] was good they believed that they
[19:08] believed the sign come on Rabbi to my
[19:11] church we'll give you full cooperation
[19:13] sure we believe you you're um you're the
[19:16] wonderful you're the rabbi uh you're the
[19:18] young Prophet come in all kinds of
[19:20] cooperation the sign is wonderful but
[19:23] when the voice speaks and said I and my
[19:26] father are one amen oh my they couldn't
[19:29] believe that you make yourself God they
[19:31] don't want the voice they like the
[19:34] sign they know that they admitted it
[19:38] admitted it was the sign of the Messiah
[19:40] but the voice they didn't like
[19:45] that the works that I do shall you do
[19:48] also and they said he is
[19:51] Beelzebub so here comes here comes uh
[19:56] you know brother brandom is calling that
[19:59] the
[20:00] sign that they had was God made flesh
[20:05] right that was the sign that Sodom had
[20:06] was there was God made flesh amongst
[20:09] them that was their sign right and and
[20:13] you know in another place I don't have
[20:15] it here but he talks about how those
[20:16] angels went down to Sodom and that they
[20:17] had a great
[20:19] Revival right they had a great
[20:21] Revival there were there you know so
[20:24] many times people like the sign they
[20:27] like go God made flesh they like to be
[20:30] around it there's lots of fishes and
[20:31] Loaves there's lots of lame people
[20:33] walking there's lots of blind people
[20:35] seeing when there's god-made flesh
[20:37] around right there's there's they like
[20:41] the the good works they like the the the
[20:43] benefits you know people really really
[20:46] like the the the results that God
[20:49] produces when he indwells within
[20:52] people but the minute that that word
[20:54] made flesh looks at them and says okay
[20:56] but now you can do the same
[20:59] works right now it's your turn oh
[21:03] suddenly you're be elub right suddenly
[21:06] when the voice of the sign right you
[21:10] know people liked the the the the the
[21:14] ministry of William brandham right oh
[21:16] people liked the the healings they liked
[21:18] the healing campaigns they liked it when
[21:20] he raised the dead they liked it when
[21:22] you know he emptied out
[21:24] hospitals but when the voice went forth
[21:27] and said come out of her my
[21:29] people oh suddenly people got their
[21:31] hackles up right suddenly oh we don't
[21:33] like that we don't like it when you know
[21:37] he's he's telling us how to live we
[21:39] don't like it when he's telling us how
[21:41] you know you know uh uh the the things
[21:44] that we like so much are of the devil
[21:47] right he doesn't you know people don't
[21:49] like it when you know they're they're uh
[21:54] huh when they have to confront the fact
[21:58] that
[21:59] denominational system that they're a
[22:01] part of is called a name of blasphemy by
[22:05] the by the scripture amen right people
[22:08] don't like that you know and in this day
[22:12] you know there's there's people who are
[22:14] the word made flesh right you you are
[22:16] the word made flesh that is Christ
[22:18] Living in you am the hope of glory and
[22:21] and you are living a life that only
[22:23] Christ could live through you and people
[22:25] you know you go out into the world and
[22:27] people like that people people like to
[22:28] be around you people like you know huh
[22:31] people like to hire message people right
[22:35] people like the fact that you know
[22:36] message people don't aren't a a security
[22:40] risk right they like to have message
[22:42] people on their payroll because they
[22:43] don't have to worry about them stealing
[22:45] from the company and that they're going
[22:46] to show it up or work on time and
[22:48] they're not just going to run the clock
[22:49] and they're actually going to do work on
[22:50] the on the you know when they're on pay
[22:52] on the clock they like the hardworking
[22:54] message people they like to you know
[22:56] they're friendly they're kind they
[22:58] they'll you know give you the shirt off
[23:00] their back they like message people
[23:04] right but the moment they go and ask a
[23:07] message person what makes you the way
[23:09] you
[23:10] are and now it's now they're presented
[23:13] okay we're not just a product of of a
[23:16] denomination this isn't just this isn't
[23:18] just doctrinal like this isn't just you
[23:21] didn't get this because we got some new
[23:23] updated
[23:24] version of no no this is this something
[23:26] to this there's life in this and the
[23:28] only way you're going to get it is
[23:29] through a message of the hour and that
[23:31] message of the hour is going to is going
[23:33] to call out a lot of the nonsense of the
[23:35] world oh people will suddenly I mean
[23:37] they'll love you and then the minute
[23:39] that they see what makes you who you are
[23:41] Oh They'll turn on you right oh then the
[23:44] knives come
[23:46] out because they love the
[23:50] sign right they love that sign of the
[23:55] word made flesh but boy they don't like
[23:58] the voice
[24:03] and so here's here's Abraham speaking to
[24:07] the to Jehovah made flesh right there's
[24:09] a man in front of him speaking to him
[24:11] and he and he does the and he he
[24:13] performs
[24:14] the the uh the Messianic sign right he
[24:18] discerns the hearts right this was
[24:20] always the sign of the Messiah well and
[24:21] the reason was the sign of the Messiah
[24:23] is because the Jews knew that that's how
[24:26] that's what Jehovah did when Jehovah met
[24:29] Abraham right that they knew that the
[24:31] Messiah would do the same thing because
[24:32] that's what Jehovah did and so anyone
[24:34] who does that it's an indication that
[24:37] there's Jehovah there right that only
[24:39] Jehovah can discern the discern the
[24:42] hearts that's why the woman at the well
[24:44] knew that Christ was the Messiah when he
[24:46] met her there because she told her
[24:48] everything that she had
[24:51] done so here's the
[24:54] question when William brandham turned
[24:56] his back on an audience and starts
[24:59] Discerning people in the crowd who did
[25:02] that now I'm not saying you know you
[25:04] know William Brandon was a man I'm not
[25:05] trying to make William brand the Messiah
[25:07] by any stretch but there was certainly a
[25:09] messiah there right there was something
[25:12] more like you know the man William
[25:15] brandham yeah he'll he'll you know he
[25:17] flew off into a temper and was going to
[25:19] go shoot a bunch of people over a dog
[25:21] you know or you know when he steep you
[25:23] know even after he got the Holy Ghost
[25:24] he's ministered for years steps out the
[25:25] back door and tells a lie because he
[25:26] didn't want to talk to a lawyer you that
[25:29] that's a man man you know people fail
[25:31] that's not that's not Christ but but
[25:34] when he's telling people what they had
[25:35] done and and the thoughts and intents of
[25:38] their heart that's more than William
[25:39] brandham that did that right so there
[25:41] was there was word made flesh there was
[25:43] word in flesh in our
[25:46] day and and here's here's
[25:49] uh
[25:51] Sarah and Abraham confronted with the
[25:54] word made flesh in their day and he's
[25:56] here he is deserting their hearts and so
[25:57] when he
[25:59] speaks Sarah
[26:02] laughs right Sarah
[26:05] says you know well that's ridiculous I I
[26:08] mean come on the circumstances of My
[26:11] Flesh do not allow for what you just
[26:14] said to to happen amen right I am too
[26:18] old I am too ancient it is biologically
[26:22] impossible for what for what the word
[26:24] made flesh just said to
[26:26] happen right and she laughed and we
[26:29] think oh that's ridiculous that's
[26:31] Jehovah he can do anything why would you
[26:33] laugh at that well I don't know Church
[26:34] why do we laugh at it right why is it
[26:37] that when when a prophet says you know
[26:40] when Christ says the works that I do
[26:41] shall you do also right not just Healing
[26:44] The Sick and raising the dead though
[26:46] that's part of it but living the life
[26:48] that he lived having the having the the
[26:52] the the love and the kindness and the
[26:55] and the the the the the willingness to
[26:57] sacrifice
[26:59] you know when those Works shall you do
[27:02] also and why do we say well that's
[27:05] impossible we could never bring forth
[27:07] the promised son in our lives our the
[27:10] circumstances of our flesh are far too
[27:13] great for the for the word to
[27:16] overcome
[27:17] that we do it all the
[27:19] time but but at the end of the day it
[27:22] doesn't really
[27:24] matter what Sarah did it didn't really
[27:27] matter whe
[27:30] the circumstances of your flesh are IR
[27:33] irrelevant right because at the end of
[27:36] the day that spoken word created a body
[27:39] change in Sarah right you know it
[27:43] created a complete Rejuvenation of the
[27:45] Flesh and that's that's the promise
[27:48] right that's the sign that you know
[27:51] people will
[27:53] reject but the bride won't right that's
[27:57] the sign because you know when when when
[28:01] uh you know as I said previously you
[28:03] know when the word came to Mary and she
[28:06] said be it unto me well again the the
[28:08] the circumstances of her flesh were such
[28:10] that the word was biologically
[28:12] impossible that was not a possibility
[28:15] and yet all it takes is Faith in that
[28:18] spoken word for it to bring it to pass
[28:20] regardless of the
[28:22] circumstances right just because you
[28:24] have all kinds of faults and failures
[28:26] and well my I just just can't get over
[28:29] myself you're right you can't but God
[28:31] can and God will God will obey the
[28:35] Overcomer it's you know it's the spirit
[28:37] of God within you that
[28:39] overcomes not you not you know some grit
[28:43] and determination but say Lord I I want
[28:46] to live right I want to do better I I I
[28:49] don't want to be subject to these things
[28:52] that that hold me down that hold me back
[28:54] these places where my faith is weak well
[28:56] and when you're weak he's strong and
[28:59] wherever you need you
[29:01] need uh Deliverance well the Lord is
[29:04] there to deliver you and and overcome
[29:06] your flesh because that's what he
[29:08] promised to do and the word it has to do
[29:10] it it can't not you know when when
[29:17] uh it's like when uh brother Jason was
[29:20] talking about this um we talked about
[29:22] the third
[29:24] poll here's Abraham taking his son Isaac
[29:29] to the mountain to sacrifice him and he
[29:31] says and Isaac says well here's the
[29:33] here's the the fire and the wood but
[29:35] where's the lamb and Abraham says God
[29:37] will provide himself a lamb what's that
[29:41] what was he doing Abraham spoke that
[29:42] lamb into existence right he spoke that
[29:45] lamb into
[29:47] existence when that spoken word Goes
[29:49] Forth it can not happen right it it has
[29:52] to happen and so when you have the
[29:55] prophet of the age standing behind a
[29:58] Pulpit calling forth a bride and saying
[30:01] and and calling forth people message
[30:02] Believers and saying you will be go in a
[30:05] Rapture you're going in a Rapture it has
[30:07] to be and speaking a word of
[30:09] Prophecy it's going to happen it has to
[30:12] happen regardless of your faults and
[30:13] failures regardless of of any weakness
[30:16] that you have regardless of
[30:19] anything it will
[30:22] happen and I'm out of
[30:26] time we'll we'll stand and stand and
[30:28] have a word of
[30:34] prayer father Lord we thank you for
[30:37] this time that you've spent with us Lord
[30:40] ask that you would be with us through
[30:41] the remainder of the service Lord as the
[30:45] singing and the worship come forward
[30:48] Lord that it would just be an extension
[30:50] of the worship of Our Lives Lord that
[30:52] that our lives would be a worship and
[30:54] that as we would sing it would just be
[30:56] the the the the recognition of what
[30:59] you've done for us already and father
[31:02] that throughout the service that our
[31:03] hearts would be open that we'd set aside
[31:05] the cares of the world and not be
[31:07] burdened down
[31:09] by by uh the things that the you know uh
[31:16] our minds that our our minds would be
[31:18] stayed upon your word Lord that our
[31:21] hearts we'd have the right mental
[31:23] attitude toward the word that we would
[31:24] hear today that we would be man we would
[31:27] manifest in our lives we ask these
[31:30] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:31] Christ amen amen
