[0:00] and
[0:03] gracious heavenly father we come before
[0:04] you lord and we want to dedicate this
[0:06] time
[0:07] to you and ask that your presence would
[0:09] come and speak to our hearts lord that
[0:11] you'd help me to step out of the way and
[0:13] let your spirit just flow through to
[0:16] your people to their hearts father we
[0:17] ask these things in jesus name
[0:19] amen
[0:21] we're going to continue on speaking on
[0:23] the subject keeping keep thy heart
[0:26] and scripture we're going to read to
[0:28] start is proverbs 4 23
[0:31] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[0:34] out of it are the issues of life amen
[0:37] you can be seated
[0:40] the word
[0:42] keep there
[0:44] means to protect
[0:47] or to maintain
[0:50] and the word diligence there means to
[0:52] guard or to keep the post
[0:55] so to keep thy heart
[0:58] it's speaking of maintenance
[1:01] right so
[1:03] when you have a vehicle
[1:06] what happens if you don't change the oil
[1:08] ever
[1:11] right it it's going to explode
[1:14] here you're going to destroy your engine
[1:16] and nothing's going to function right
[1:18] and you have put in the junkyard
[1:20] so what happens to a christian
[1:23] that doesn't do regular maintenance on
[1:26] their heart
[1:28] well it doesn't mean you stop being a
[1:30] christian
[1:31] because once you have the holy ghost
[1:32] you're sealed until the day of your
[1:34] redemption
[1:35] but you can become
[1:37] an extremely ineffective weak christian
[1:41] that is unable to really function the
[1:44] way that god has designed for you to
[1:45] function
[1:46] so there has to be
[1:49] regular maintenance
[1:51] not just of the outward things why go to
[1:53] church and i look the part no on the
[1:55] inside
[1:56] your heart because you can look the part
[1:58] i mean look at the pharisees
[2:00] professionals
[2:02] professionals at
[2:04] being fakers
[2:07] they they follow up paul paul speaks
[2:10] you know in a sense quite glowingly
[2:13] of his devotion to the law and in
[2:15] regards to the law he said he was
[2:16] blameless
[2:19] and you know he said i was a pharisee of
[2:21] the pharisees
[2:23] and
[2:25] yet his heart
[2:26] caused him to persecute jesus christ
[2:30] and so it's not about outward obedience
[2:32] it's about the condition
[2:34] of your heart
[2:35] that's what jesus emphasis was
[2:37] that's what the emphasis of the gospel
[2:39] altogether is and in fact even the old
[2:41] testament speaks clearly up there's
[2:44] something that we need to watch over
[2:47] our heart we need to do regular
[2:49] maintenance and we need to do it with
[2:51] diligence
[2:52] so
[2:54] maintain thy heart
[2:57] as keeping the post anybody knows what
[2:59] keeping the post beans is your
[3:02] your job in the military is a guard and
[3:05] you're guarding a station and you're
[3:07] saying this one it has to be protected
[3:10] we can't let any enemies
[3:12] come in this direction only authorized
[3:14] personnel
[3:16] and so
[3:17] this is the same thing that the the lord
[3:19] is speaking to us through this proverb
[3:22] is that we need to
[3:24] be guarding our hearts like it's
[3:27] like our life depends on it because it
[3:30] actually
[3:30] does and then that next part for out of
[3:33] it
[3:34] are the issues of life
[3:38] in other words
[3:39] it determines the course of your life
[3:42] think about that for a minute
[3:46] it can be religious
[3:48] you can be a quote unquote message
[3:50] believer
[3:52] but unless you're guarding your heart
[3:54] unless your heart is in the right
[3:56] condition you'll be doing it for the
[3:58] wrong reasons your religious pride
[4:00] and it's a stink in god's nostrils
[4:03] god doesn't
[4:05] it's not pleasing to the lord just to
[4:07] follow
[4:08] the outward motions
[4:10] if your motive is wrong if your motive
[4:12] is to be seen by people
[4:14] and
[4:15] to be
[4:17] politically correct
[4:18] in the message i'm not saying
[4:20] politically correct
[4:21] for the world none of us want to be that
[4:24] but politically correct for the message
[4:26] and fit in and follow
[4:28] a certain order and we've got to be this
[4:30] your heart is probably a million miles
[4:32] from god
[4:34] it's not about looking the part
[4:36] and fitting in with everybody else it's
[4:38] about being who god made you to be
[4:41] otherwise we're all useless
[4:44] if we're just here to fit the part to
[4:46] sit in a pew and say amen to the
[4:48] preacher and make the preacher feel good
[4:49] and
[4:50] and sound good and look good no that's
[4:52] not
[4:53] what god's after he's after a body
[4:56] that works and functions all together in
[5:00] unity
[5:01] and isn't isn't it amazing the only way
[5:03] it'll work together in unity is each of
[5:05] us get our eyes off of each other
[5:07] and get our eyes on christ and say i
[5:10] want to be pleasing to him no matter
[5:11] what even if the whole world abandons me
[5:13] even if i'm the all alone even if i have
[5:16] to make a stand and it causes people to
[5:18] hate me and continually speak out
[5:20] against me
[5:22] i'm going to take a stand because i want
[5:24] my heart to be right before anything
[5:26] else
[5:27] it's not about politics
[5:29] message politics
[5:31] it's not about being pleasing to the
[5:34] great pastors
[5:35] and the quote-unquote senior pastors of
[5:37] the message
[5:38] that's not what we exist for we exist to
[5:41] please god that's what the message
[5:43] teaches us time and time again
[5:46] our heart
[5:48] has to be right
[5:49] and when our heart is right that will
[5:52] that will determine
[5:53] the correct course of your life but if
[5:56] your heart isn't right i don't care how
[5:57] many times you go to church
[5:59] how many times you do outwardly the
[6:02] things that you're supposed to do you're
[6:04] not even saved yet
[6:07] salvation is something where your heart
[6:10] is changed now we can all go through
[6:12] times and seasons as born-again
[6:14] believers where we're
[6:16] not thinking right
[6:18] we're not acting right we've done the
[6:20] wrong thing god will correct that god
[6:22] will deal with that but the thing is
[6:24] you've got to get your eyes off of
[6:26] outward appearances and
[6:28] onto the heart
[6:30] because that what that's what god is
[6:32] dealing with and when your heart is
[6:34] right then the rest of it will be right
[6:36] but if your heart is not right and
[6:38] you're just following it on the outside
[6:39] that's fine that's the best the best way
[6:41] to live is the christian life but that's
[6:43] not spiritual
[6:45] that's not salvation
[6:46] that's just mimicking other people
[6:49] our brother branham says that's just
[6:50] being able to read
[6:52] and come to a logical conclusion no you
[6:54] have to have the token
[6:56] dwelling in your heart not on your flesh
[6:59] not on your spirit brother branham says
[7:01] that over and over again you can be
[7:02] anointed on the flesh you can be
[7:04] anointed in your spirit
[7:06] i don't mean you're that saved
[7:09] that just means there's an anointing no
[7:11] it's something that comes in your soul
[7:14] changes you and directs your life and
[7:16] corrects you and convicts you of sin
[7:19] and leads you
[7:20] in the issues of life
[7:23] in the direction of your life
[7:28] this is from a puritan writer
[7:31] john flavel
[7:33] a book that he wrote on
[7:36] proverbs 4 23 actually he says god
[7:39] rejects all duties how glorious so ever
[7:42] in other respects which are offered him
[7:44] without the heart
[7:46] he that performs duty without the heart
[7:49] that is heedlessly
[7:50] is no more accepted with with god than
[7:53] he that performs it with a double heart
[7:55] that is
[7:56] hypocritically in other words just
[7:59] what i was saying outward obedience for
[8:01] the sake of being seen
[8:03] by others is not pleasing to the lord
[8:06] it's not what god wants from us he wants
[8:09] our heart
[8:11] to be on fire
[8:12] he wants our heart to be in the midst of
[8:15] it so that
[8:16] what we're doing
[8:17] is
[8:19] coming from that transformed nature
[8:21] god is not pleased with just mere duty
[8:25] he wants your heart
[8:32] jesus teaching i'm just going to go
[8:33] quickly over these
[8:35] in the sermon on the mount i mentioned
[8:37] it last week
[8:39] motivation matters
[8:41] in god's sight
[8:42] if the motive of your heart is wrong you
[8:45] can you no matter what you do
[8:48] it's not pleasing to the lord
[8:51] take heed that you do not your alms
[8:53] before men to be seen of them
[8:55] otherwise you have no reward of your
[8:57] father which is in heaven your reward
[8:59] when your motivation is to be seen by
[9:01] people and you're seen by people you
[9:03] have your reward but if your motive is
[9:06] to be obedient to the lord to glorify
[9:09] him and to help others and you do it
[9:11] discreetly
[9:13] you have a reward in heaven amen
[9:19] and when you pray don't be
[9:21] don't be like the hypocrites they love
[9:23] to pray standing in the synagogues and
[9:24] in the corners of the streets nothing
[9:26] wrong with that you should do that
[9:29] why not
[9:30] you should pray in church
[9:33] you should pray on the street paul says
[9:35] lift up hands
[9:37] everywhere
[9:38] right
[9:39] without wrath or doubting so it isn't
[9:42] condemning praying in church and
[9:45] praying in public no
[9:47] but it's the motive of the heart doing
[9:50] it to be seen by people doing it to
[9:52] sound
[9:53] intelligent and spiritual that's
[9:56] you're going to receive your reward
[9:58] right there which is everyone's going to
[9:59] think he's intelligent and spiritual
[10:02] that's we want answered prayer
[10:04] we don't want to just big heads we want
[10:06] answered prayer we want god to move
[10:09] through our prayers and if our heart
[10:10] isn't right he's not going to do it
[10:15] when you fast be not as the hypocrites
[10:17] of a sad countenance for they disfigure
[10:19] their faces that they may appear unto
[10:21] men to fast verily i say unto you they
[10:23] have their reward
[10:26] but thou will now fastest anoint thine
[10:27] head and wash thy face
[10:29] that thou appear not unto men to fast
[10:31] but unto thy father which is in secret
[10:33] and thy father which sees
[10:35] in secret shall reward you
[10:38] openly
[10:39] again the motive of the heart
[10:42] jesus is looking at this he's not saying
[10:44] what they're do what they're doing is
[10:46] wrong in fact in in this scripture about
[10:48] fasting it says repent in sackcloth and
[10:51] ashes in the old testament
[10:53] it it commands them to do that on the
[10:55] day of atonement they are supposed if
[10:57] they're going to be obedient they're
[10:59] supposed to do that what is jesus saying
[11:01] he's not saying don't ever do that what
[11:04] he's saying let your mot what is your
[11:06] motive
[11:07] what is your objective okay on the day
[11:09] of atonement do that but you're doing
[11:10] that all twice a week
[11:12] just so people see that you're a good
[11:15] good in good standing as a member of the
[11:17] pharisees
[11:18] that's not that's not why we do it
[11:21] that's not why
[11:23] we come to church
[11:24] that's not why
[11:26] we we we pray that's not why we seek the
[11:29] lord we don't do it because we want to
[11:31] want to look good we want to have our
[11:33] position and place
[11:35] in church
[11:38] we do it whether anybody sees it or not
[11:41] amen
[11:42] amen
[11:45] this is from the amplified version
[11:47] psalm 4
[11:49] verse 3 and 4 we're going to read
[11:51] but know that the lord has set apart for
[11:53] himself and dealt wondrously with the
[11:56] godly man the one of honorable character
[11:58] and moral moral courage
[12:00] the one who does right the lord hears
[12:03] and responds when i call to him
[12:06] tremble
[12:07] with the anger of fear and do not sin
[12:10] meditate in your heart upon your bed and
[12:13] be still
[12:14] and they add there reflect upon
[12:16] reflect on your sin
[12:18] and repent of your
[12:20] rebellion
[12:22] so this this verse is is telling us we
[12:24] need to cons we need to consider
[12:27] watch over our lives
[12:29] and check our hearts check our motives
[12:32] check the reason why we're doing things
[12:34] and and just look at our lives did i
[12:36] speak something on a place that would
[12:37] have hurt somebody that would have heard
[12:38] somebody did i do something and we we
[12:41] need to we need to examine
[12:43] our hearts
[12:45] we can't just live and go on and say oh
[12:47] well
[12:48] we need we need to have hearts that are
[12:51] repentant sorrowful for the the things
[12:55] that we've done wrong and then we we
[12:57] confess our sin to the lord and then we
[12:59] get up and we move forward
[13:02] but but
[13:03] we can't live in such a heedless life
[13:06] just hurdling ourselves forward and not
[13:09] considering our ways
[13:10] and our in our doings
[13:17] this is andrew murray
[13:20] in one of his books on prayer he says
[13:22] shut the world out
[13:24] withdraw from all worldly thoughts and
[13:26] occupation and shut yourself in alone
[13:28] with god
[13:29] to pray to him in secret
[13:32] let this be your chief object in prayer
[13:35] i love this to realize
[13:37] the presence of your heavenly father
[13:40] let that be our heart and our motivation
[13:42] when we go
[13:43] in prayer
[13:44] you know we want to keep our heart you
[13:46] can't do that without being a person of
[13:48] prayer
[13:51] if you just whisper a five-minute prayer
[13:53] on the way to work that's good
[13:55] but you need you need to take time
[13:58] alone with god you need to dedicate
[13:59] yourself
[14:01] to this
[14:02] art of praying
[14:07] from the blind bartimaeus 1957 brother
[14:09] branham says and it's there that when
[14:11] the greatest revelation and inspiration
[14:13] comes is
[14:27] say he he didn't say the greatest time
[14:30] where revelation and inspiration comes
[14:32] is at the church service
[14:34] sorry guys
[14:37] the greatest place where there is
[14:38] inspiration and revelation is you
[14:41] alone with god god works through the
[14:44] ministry god works for the preaching of
[14:46] the word i'm not not saying that he
[14:48] doesn't i'm saying that
[14:50] in order for that word to get in you
[14:52] you need to get alone with god
[14:55] and meditate on those things so that the
[14:57] spirit of god comes and permeates your
[14:59] very being
[15:01] not just i come to church i go to church
[15:03] i hear it and then it's just out of your
[15:04] head
[15:05] from then on
[15:06] it should be something that we're
[15:08] meditating on praying over seeking the
[15:10] lord over
[15:13] this is
