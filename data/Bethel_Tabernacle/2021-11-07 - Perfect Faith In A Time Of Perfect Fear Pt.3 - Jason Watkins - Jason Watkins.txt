the lord um brother travis you might have to adjust my mic because i'm on the lapel today my headset came apart on me back there i think something broke on it so hey man we'll just go go with this older way amen i'm sure they can get it adjusted god bless you happy to be in the house of god today hey man it's a little bit of a rainy weather and but i think it'll be cleared off by at least stop raining by noon and clear it off by the time we get out and we're going to plan to have our little fellowship get together out here this this afternoon for our lunch and uh i think brother matt's working on it now getting ready we'll have a little bonfire and some fellowship amen i'm looking forward to that amen praise the lord i love getting together with god's people amen praise the lord brothers the monitor on the back wall is not on it's not working uh so if you can get that on that'd be amazing all right we've got a couple of prayer requests that were sent in to me i don't know if you prayed over them already brother brother anthony wrote to say his dad is home with oxygen and continue to pray for his energy and lung strength amen so we want to pray for brother george sister chastity writes i'd like to be put on the prayer request list today i have a colonoscopy on tuesday so i want to be praying for our sister in that my sister lisa in washington state has a terrible infection over her um left eye i believe it would be and uh don't know if she got staph or spider bite they can't figure it out but it's swelled up uh gruesome looking really and so it's a lot of pain she said so they've got her own very high doses of antibiotics trying to beat it back so would you be praying for her as well amen praise the lord we want to invite you to genesis chapter 1 and we'll pray over these needs just as we go to prayer over the scripture i just have a single verse in genesis chapter 1. we want to read the very first verse it's good to feel like we're getting back in the groove of normalcy here amen happy to be here on a sunday morning have you all out with us amen praise the lord we apologize we couldn't get a sunday school class put together but uh that was just impossible uh-huh there's see told you my mic broke there's a piece in it i thought i had a bug he's about to see a dance hey man praise the lord all right so we put that right there but um i'm glad that thing broke under preaching praise the lord it got wore out by the gospel amen so we'll get another one that's a good way to break something um amen so uh we're we couldn't put that together this morning we just had so much going on trying to get everything back grooving and brother jd is still needing his strength to be replenished so would you keep praying for him as well amen i know also uh brother mark is still his body's still trying to adjust to the new blood flow and medications i i understand that it took me probably six eight weeks before it didn't bother me anymore and uh it would especially bother me trying to preach and i've gotten used to it now we had a baby dedication plan we were going to dedicate our little newest little sister hazel grace but amen the devil in his last parting shot from you know the last thing he could do kind of a lot like reached from the grave was he uh hit me with a head cold on my way coming home from camp and so i'm still a little bit stopped up coughing a little bit but so we decided the better part of wisdom would just be weight and uh devastate me to give that little sister a head cold amen so early he's only six weeks out in the world and i mean she's still under warranty i get it but but we don't want to we don't want to make her sick and so we we appreciate brother john says meredith being back with us today and we're getting to see her anyway amen praise the lord genesis chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth i wonder if you'd read it with me in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth father we thank you for your word this morning we've read it now it's a divinely revealed truth that you've given to mankind lord to help him father to find his way through an impossible situation really lord a dark world and a fallen condition and there's just no way lord that he can manage his way jeremiah told us that very clearly he said it's not in a man to discover his own way he can't figure it out there's no way he'll get it wrong he'll go over a cliff every time he's got to have a guide he's got to have a leader what better leader could there be than the creator of all things lord so i pray today that you will bless your word to the hearer bless both speaker and hearer it's burning on my heart and i just want to be able to give it in the flow that you gave it to me and boy did you ever give it to me lord i went to prayer and here it comes so i'm asking you now today lord to finish up now your intent for the people to be strengthened by it lord we're thanking you today for brother george smith's return home our dear brother brother tony's dad lord but he's he's he's elderly way up in years and this this is a a a terrible thing he still has to have oxygen and lord we're just praying for strength praying that you will give his strength back and clear his lungs completely lord that he might stand again in the house of god as i know his desire is to do bless brother tony and the members of the family who are there lord keep them all safe and for our sister chastity lord we're remembering her in advance now this coming tuesday you see the procedure she's facing and lord that's not a small thing and so we're giving that to you and asking you for your great mercy upon all the medical team and staff and be with our sister now for perfect results we commit it to you in jesus name and all these things the church said amen god bless you friends you can be seated oh excellent okay [Music] i wish by the help of the lord today to carry on in the little series that i've been working on faith versus fear and we've been taking a subtitle perfect faith in a time of perfect fear there are um nearly um well it wouldn't i suppose be completely innumerable you could actually make the list but it would be lengthy and long of the things that i could that i could name to you from the scriptures and show you the various prophecies that relate to uniquely the hour uh getting some echoey kind of thing brother mark so maybe a little less hot monitor maybe and and that the things that were prophesied to come to pass uniquely in the day and hour that we live and it it's not in every case uh to say that us that it wasn't under partial fulfillment uh or at least certainly true in the world in times past for instance we've used this one very often is that the apostle paul writing to timothy says that in the last days perilous times shall come now it was not to suggest that perilous times weren't there as he was writing it i think brother paul could talk a lot about perilous times and so he he talks about being a night in the day in the deep being robbed being betrayed of his own countrymen being beaten 39 stripes twice being imprisoned and all kinds of things sometimes if i get to feeling too sorry for myself i go back and read about paul's life i'm here to tell you something that brother went through it all of them did and so uh they they did not have an easy way to go so they certainly had perilous times but paul is referencing a particular level of peril that would come in the last days he goes on to break it down and detail it and in fact is it's in the detail that we can see so clearly that it is a reference to our day where men shall be truths breakers and false accusers and incontinent fears and despisers of those that are good heady high-minded and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god and so that's always been true just like jesus said you'll have wars and rumors of wars the end is not yet these things must come uh summer is nigh and then when you see all of these things lift up your head your redemption draws nice so we see the process of prophecy down through the ages where god has promised certain things that would come now it's it's comforting to me very comforting to me that he also that you know writes in the same way you know among the other apostles the holy spirit moves on the scene to say listen that you know don't don't forget that you god gives you a way to be an overcomer and there's actually practical steps that you can take and and one apostle pins to say listen make sure you're on the lookout you people at the end time make sure you're on the lookout for the for the grace that'll be given at the revelation of jesus christ i'm here to say got it paul thank you amen i was looking out for that and i found it i'm under a particular unique grace in this hour amen and so we find that god would come back in this day you know when the so there's there's so much about this bride of christ today that is unique she will be taking a body change the early church couldn't do that they they slipped back they fell away they turned cold and they the church backslid and instead of christ being able to come and uh take a bride for himself he had to sit back down in the eternities intercede on behalf of the ignorance of the people seal up the word in seven seals but he promised at the last day in a unique hour he would come and he would break those seals open and he would unveil himself and when he unveiled himself the when the mighty god was unveiled we saw once again for the first time in 2000 years we saw the mighty god unveiled again perfectly in his family so now the alpha that was what they had they they were not lacking in the token they were not lacking in the understanding you're certainly not going to get more understanding than saint paul had every doctrine we teach is based on his teaching and so we find that that it would that god promised that it would come back in a restoration so that a bride could once again feed on the full word to come into the fullness to take a body change at last amen aren't you glad to be part of that finally after 2 000 years and seven contiguous ages we find that a bride is now ready to enter into that unique position of taking uh uh for a global bride to go all together in a moment amen in the twinkling of an eye and be changed and caught up to meet the lord amen we find that because of this god would need and of necessity he would he would have to there would be a great need and he would thus promise that in the last day because that it would be so uniquely perilous because it would be so uniquely dark not only on the whole earth but gross darkly darkness on the people's minds and so in order to do this in order to get a bride to be able to to have perfect faith he would have to come in such a way that the bride could receive it and and allow that reception of that word to change her i'm here to tell you something friends you are what you eat what you feed on you're you're transformed into the things you gaze at the bible teaches us and so we find that god would send this word to do what faith comes by hearing what the word and so if we're going to take if we're going to have a perfect faith aren't we going to need a perfect word if we're going to come to perfection aren't we going to need a perfect god to keep a perfect promise amen this is just logic common sense there's no way the church in her condition at the end of laodicea as it's described to us in revelation 3 there's no way when you read that description no wonder brother branham could say the situation for the church at the last day was that they couldn't go in the rapture like they were that's bad enough but as if that's not bad enough he would go on to say and it can't get any better why because they've already put christ out crucified him the second time but there is a bride who is loving that word and loving his appearing as paul said he would do he would appear and all those who love that appearing have a crown of righteousness awaiting them now you surely believe by now that you could never get yourself in a rapture surely you believe by now we dealt with this last time i remember in the scripture where we showed how that jehoshaphat the difference between i mean hezekiah the difference between him and cinecrab when he come into from egypt and surrounded jerusalem and threatened to sack it and and he he made all these boasts there's no god that can protect you and and hezekiah began to encourage the people to say listen he's got the he's got he's trusting in the arm of flesh but we are trusting in almighty god and almighty god cannot be defeated by almighty flesh it's impossible and so they they took courage in that and that's the message for you today because we're preaching on faith versus fear we're taking a perfect faith in a time of perfect fear and i'm here to tell you you don't have to fall victim to that perfect fear you can you have an opportunity to live in perfect faith now the difference between perfect faith and human faith is in human faith it's you operating it in perfect faith it's god operating it in you by a revelation that you have opened your heart to and you have received it and i'm here to tell you it is doing more in you than you are even aware of [Applause] thank god for that because that i i i constantly walk through the house and every time i pass in front of a mirror and i just i look at that guy looking back at me and i say man there's no chance for you you're never going to get in a rapture but i know that i'm looking at the wrong thing when i look at that i need to look at a promise and i need to look and say but in my heart i believe the promise see so it's it's it's not that it's not that believing the word is like a uh it's a reward uh it's not like it's not like eternal life is a reward for believing the word you didn't you know you didn't hit a lotto it's not what this is right it is so so i'm going to say it again eternal life is not a reward for believing the word believing the word is an evidence of eternal life you see the difference don't look at it people say oh well i i i believe the word so i'm going to get to go to heaven it's not a reward your your faith in the word is an evidence that something has happened inside your heart and that's what the devil don't want you to understand because if he can get you to think it's a reward you'll never think you've earned it and it has nothing to do with you earning it it's the grace of almighty god that was to come at the revelation of jesus christ so be glad and rejoice for the bride whether you think it or not hath made herself ready amen and it's not you it's the word preparing your heart and your mind amen we're oftentimes believers in spite of ourselves yeah that's right thank god i'm glad i have an alien amen inside me that's different from me separate from me it's another being and he lives inside me and even when this outer man would stumble and fail the the inner man says amen hallelujah brother donnie has a wonderful drama that he does with that where he he says you know he says that inner man goes to church he said that outer man will say i'm too tired it's too wet and cold i don't want to go to church and the inner man says listen here buddy we're going to church now get dressed amen it's comical watching him do it he he he goes into a lot of depth on it but but it's true friends if you're only relying on your flesh or my flesh or anybody's flesh we've preached to you on this series already don't trust in the arm of flesh amen and the way that you get you say well i'm i'm in flesh how do i when i run away from myself and you can't do that but what peter did say is that you could add to your faith virtue and add to your virtue knowledge and add your knowledge timberson and if then build it up build it up build it up paul said it like this put on the whole armor of god see and put on the helmet of salvation those are those are metaphorical terms but we get it as human beings as christians we understand that our strength is in the word and there's strength and fellowship with the holy spirit amen and so so we find that the best way to overcome your flesh and to be the kind of man or woman that god foresaw you as before the foundation of the world is to take those practical steps this is not some mystical ethereal you know the the uh the greeks were like that they all just they loved hearing something new and they wanted paul to come back and preach to him again because they loved hearing those new things when paul finally turned the screws and went to the word then they were ready to murder him and so it's always going to be that way the enemy hates god and listen he's not just god's enemy he's your enemy and that's you know young people need to hear that constantly the devil's your enemy he's not your friend my goodness no he wants to kill you your parents your pastor everybody he he hates he hates your stand for the word he has the whole world but he hates that he don't have you he's got all the denominational systems and all the politics and all the education centers and he's got all the all the society and the fabric and the social integration and he's got control of all that it's satan's eden and it just burns him that he don't have this little bitty bride around the world i say we burn him i say we go out of here next week and just burn his hide living according to the word of god amen he's going to come after you whether you do or not why don't you go ahead and get your shots in see amen so we've been dealing with that that we have access to perfect faith in a time of perfect fear you won't survive if you don't press to live in perfect faith we know that for every effect there must be a cause physical science teaches us that but but there does not have to be on effect for every cause because god is uncaused amen amen god is uncaused he's the original cause and effect all in one aristotle deals with this effect when he tries to explain the origin of everything it's a futile attempt but i appreciated his attempt he goes he he he postulates that if there is anything that now exists and this is somewhat put in modern layman's terms you can actually find his original writings if there's anything that now exists then there had to be a cause greater than the things that were created and the indescribable infinite nature of the universe had a cause much greater than itself and that cause was god amen see he goes on what is greater the house that the builder built or the builder himself well of course it's the builder because without him there wouldn't be a house i don't care so no matter how great you build it the builder is still greater see so he's the original cause the building is only the effect all right so so therefore he teaches that the builder will always be greater than anything that he can build just as a creator has to be by necessity greater than anything he could create so aristotle saw the expanse of space as a living universe he called it that it's like it's a living universe a living universe he could see the movements he knew there was something driving it he knew it couldn't be an accident it was too perfect [Music] the stars and the bodies and the planets and the galaxies and everything that they could see and all he had was just you know crude instruments to see that but he but he could see the seasons and he could he could see how the tide is affected by the moon he could see what happens to crops in the sunlight he understood the the stars above his head and to to at least to a certain degree and he he considered it it would have to be a living universe and so so when he sees it like that and of course now this is exactly he's right that's exactly why the bible refers to the sun and the moon as christ in the church yeah amen see that's why brother branham would say the stars was his first bible this was his third one the second one was the one enoch built and the one in the stars and the one enoch built and this one all agree harmoniously all he's doing is he keeps getting within the stars you can see the virgin you can see leo the lion you can see the cross fishes they all fit to the gospel perfectly brother branham said it starts in the virgin and goes through the cross fishes comes to leo the lion and you can see that enoch built a little clear understanding of that in his pyramid seven steps to the king's chamber and and and this four sided uh you know with with a base and it goes up and there was no capstone put on it because he knocked went in a rapture and the the cornerstone which is a capstone on a pyramid was rejected and that and you see that happening in history those aren't accidents it's synchronous it's harmonious and that's why that's why when we read this word this word is synchronized to god just like the stars just like the pyramid and that's why when you feed on this you become synchronized to god your life becomes harmonious with god and nature amen amen the native american knew this he worshiped he didn't know exactly what but he worshipped something he worshipped the sun the moon he knew there was a higher power than himself that's why brother branham would call them some of them that we would call savages brother and said i call him a gentleman because he understood the laws of nature he didn't rape the land he didn't he didn't he didn't waste anything so so we find that god has been dealing with mankind through through the ages and and so anybody that has been willing to operate according to that intrinsic knowing then god has has a place for them he's always had that you know long before jesus ever struck the earth people were being given access to heaven now of course they were in paradise until christ ascended and then he emptied paradise out we're not here to teach on that today but i'm trying to make this point that that that we see that all heavenly bodies and planets and stars all move in precision and in the very nature of their movements now this is this is a great thought this is what aristotle was pointing at that in the very nature of their movement you can see that some force is driving them some force driving them to and not not just to move purposeless it's not just movement for the sake of movement i you i i could i could take this clicker and hurl it out into the aisle but what purpose would that serve if i wanted to use you'd have to bring it back to me so so god is not just moving things they're not just moving they were set in motion to accomplish something your life here is not just random movement in the earth at least it's not supposed to be your life was set here to be in a certain motion and when you look at the planets and the stars and the heavenly bodies you find that their movement is always a movement that tries to express the very nature and the very character of the mover amen and that's your life here your life here is set to be a movement to be a reflection to be a another image and and to to manifest the nature of the being who put you here amen so all nature it's it's amazing because because even even in even in fallen nature you know the very nature that we see that's fallen around us and and and even that fallen nature fallen with mankind into sin after the garden of eden even that nature struggles to do this even even nature it you you plant a crop and weeds will come up now but that crop will still try to grow right through that you you put seed under concrete and let the sun shine on it that that grass seed will grow sideways until it can come out and reach up to the sun so even in sin you understand the tides the the heavens the moon the sun the orbiting everything even under sin even under a fall that's why brother branham said if god had chosen the wind to preach the gospel we'd have been gone a long time ago he said if he'd chose the trees to preach the gospel we'd have been gone a long time ago because the wind would have just obeyed him the trees would have just debated him but he said it's man that gives him the problem but if you can ever surrender that man and let god be in control then your life even in a fallen flesh even in fallen sin the inner man will still try every day to bring forth the image of his maker that's what christianity is all about that's what our life in the holy ghost is all about that's what the holy ghost was given for i know i got weaknesses i know you got them we all know we got them but every day i rise up and say lord today bring me closer to the image help me conquer a little more of this sinful nature that is trapped in my flesh i'm trapped by it trapped in my flesh uh brother bradley give me hebrews 6. i want to read that on the overheads hebrews 6 verses 17 and 18. so yes we have a fallen nature in our flesh paul talks about that we seem like i got a note for it down here somewhere to read a part of a scripture he quotes look at this hebrews uh 6 verse 17 and 18. wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his councils the the uh the unchangeableness of it the irreversibleness of it see the unstoppableness of it so wherein god willing he didn't have to do it willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immediate immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath now stay right there hold on he confirmed it by an oath now god didn't have to do that because he's empirically truthful yeah and he has no capacity for falsehood but he's dealing with human beings who just like to hear somebody say i promise even though jesus said let your words be yea and nay nay god knew that in our weak state we'd just love it if god would come down lord i know you're true and i know your word is right but could you just could you just promise it to me and then i know if you promise it then you that's a double then you'll you'll be doubling it to me and so paul says god willing he was willing to more abundantly assure you and therefore he confirmed it by an oath verse 18 having confirmed it by an oath he says that by two immutable things first he couldn't lie see in which it was impossible for god to lie then the second thing is so that we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay up hold upon the hope set before us now i want you to look at this at this line who have fled for refuge to lay uh we i'm sorry god uh let me start again that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie watch it we might have a strong consolation i want you to know i am part of that we yes you are part of that we you are the one he did this for and i i i have fled this world and because i realized that there was no safety here that's what happened to me at the new birth i knew there was no safety here i realized the world was falling apart and beyond that i knew as soon as i was born again there was no satisfaction here and it became impossible to be satisfied so you know what i did i fled it as paul said we might have a strong constellation who have fled for refuge how many have fled for refuge today i ran away from my own reasoning i ran away from the philosophies of the world i knew there was only one place of safety i knew there was only one place i could find the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth god looks at everything and he sees thank you brother brad he sees that nothing is impossible nothing now with with humans with human beings poor souls there's only a very few limited things that are even possible for us as humans a man can walk on the earth if he wants to go a little faster he can run yeah if he wants uh you know he can he can learn to tread and swim across the top of water though it won't naturally support his mass or weight he he can climb and ascend high mountains if he wants to get higher out he can jump he can do what he can leap see but beyond that see now beyond that after that he's going to need to build something because mankind with just 10 fingers and 10 toes is very limited on what he can do with god all things are possible with a fallen man almost everything is impossible by comparison to what's available see and so he'll he'll have to if he wants to get across water he'll have to do it by raising an earth causeway or he might build a bridge or finally he'll build a boat or a submarine so he can go on top of it or go under it what is he trying to do he's trying to gain greater mastery of the elements that he used to be in control of yeah amen jesus still was jesus just walked on water he didn't cause away a bridge or a boat he got into the boat because they were all screaming but you know and he rebuked the wind and the waves he didn't really need to do that they needed him to do that he wasn't worried about it see because with god all things are possible and he sent his word so that to him that believe all things are possible now he's turning it to you and me what are you going to do with it you're going to say well okay well okay lord anyway no he's trying to get your attention to you that'll believe his word all things are possible not just any because that you know then you got to define it but how about i give you a definition you don't need to define oh oh what's outside of all nothing amen amen so we find that the first neither the first adam nor the second adam needed any of those things if he wants to go faster than walking or running or go higher then he can jump or climb he'll need to build a bike he'll need to build a faster motorbike he'll need to build a car he'll need to build a plane he'll finally need to build a spaceship with driven by rocket motors see his great power is that he can think and he can reason and it is conversely also his greatest downfall yes amen that he can think and that he can reason and so it's his greatest strength while at the same time remaining his greatest vulnerability and so we find that that he can calculate to achieve his goals but in view listen friends in view of controlling all the universe and all the far outer reaches of space and i mean man even with his ingenuity is still very very limited he can't control even the weather he can't stop earthquakes he can't stop tsunamis all he can do is blare a siren and tell everybody to run for the hills that's his best defense run but with god all things are possible he has no limits and israel was warned strictly in the bible not to put limits on the god of israel that is an offense to god when you harbor doubt that god will keep a promise of his word for you when you are when you let symptoms when you let circumstances cause you to be afraid i'm here to tell you something friends you want a god repellent that's one yeah fear and doubt anxiousness nervousness giving in to they say well i'm built i'm made that's fine but god's got a remedy brother brandon was a was a was half irish and he had a hot temper but the holy ghost controlled that don't just back up and say well it's in my genes well my mom my dad was like this that's no excuse for failing to take everything in the word of god into your life god gives us a choice remember that being where all things are possible he's trying to say listen you for you all things can be possible this is the age of perfect faith the devil has had very little trouble getting mankind into the age of perfect fear because the slightest thing will scare him the fear of the unknown is his most dreaded fear dark room he won't go in without a flashlight you know you don't know what's there he won't walk in a dark area because he don't know is there a cliff there i'm going to fall off and somebody got a light and so so with with all of the uncertainty in the world satan has been fantastically successful in getting the age of perfect fear and guess what here's the rub you live in it you're right here just like israel in captivity they couldn't do anything about the fact that they were in captivity with everybody and the the babylonians said hey man you're down here by the river break out your flute and your harps and your liar and all these things and sing us some happy worship songs like you did back there in jerusalem and the children of israel said how can we sing to our god and worship when we're in bondage and we're slaves our hearts are broken we're sitting here by the river moping he won't let us go home we want to go home i'm here to tell you something friends sometimes as the family of god you ever just find yourself sitting with your toes in the river of life saying lord i just love to go home i just love to plunge in i'd love for this to be over i'd love to get on with it lord can we get on with it how long you going to wait well i'm here to tell you he's got a plan he's not late he's not behind you're still here he's still here he's still got a perfection that his bride is needing to come to and so he has no limits now there are some self-imposed self-imposed uh exceptions that are sealed by an oath with no power able to bind him to anything his own righteousness binds him to the truth amen that's a self-imposed nobody could bind him to that but he he binds himself by his own righteousness he is bound to always be truthful the thing completely impossible for him to do is to lie he cannot lie you believe that say it with me he cannot lie say it again he cannot lie it's impossible for him to lie god's very nature is that he is always good and he is always just and he cannot do evil so even if calamity or judgments that seem uh that seem evil from god just know this they are always just they are always deserved god doesn't even allow you to to decide who needs to get revenge who you need to get revenge on he even reserves vengeance to himself and tells you don't do that don't take vengeance because you don't know you might be taking vengeance on somebody and they don't really deserve it you think they do but they really don't i'm god is saying i'm the only one who really knows who really deserves it so just leave that to me see and so we find then that he knows who really deserves it he is impossibly powerful impossibly powerful and not merely uh possessing unlimited abilities that's not what i'm aiming at when i say he's impossibly powerful i'm not just talking about possessing unlimited abilities for for we know that with nobody helping him i cover this in another in another part of this series with nobody helping him and just the spoken word as his only tool he literally created everything amen so so we realize we're not necessarily just talking about him being impossibly powerful not just by merely possessing unlimited abilities but but what's even more impossible is the fact that with all of that unlimited power he remains perfectly good amen and that that's quite impossible for human beings because we know that power apart from character will always lead to evil deeds and tragic outcomes humans have never been able to do that they've never been able to have unlimited power apart from character and have it turn out any good amen come on you humans look at your neighbor and say you know i'm a stinker now look back the other way and say oh honey i know you are amen break you up a little bit make you laugh you're listening pretty strong we are born with a sinful nature that makes perfect goodness unreachable while we are in this fallen flesh even with the new birth even with the new birth paul tells us in romans 7 18 to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing see so paul desired to do good he said but even when i desire it i still got to fight this flesh see showed paul had been converted there in that scripture because you can't the the the fallen mind is enmity against god it can never want god's righteousness in a fallen condition it'll always it'll always it'll always go with the way of the of the fallen nature and the fallen flesh it'll go right along with the world it'll know it's a little out of place you're like a fish out of water you know but still yet you'll go right in and just carry right along sometimes for years until god gets a hold of your life and even when he changes the inside man you're still going to battle that outside flesh that stinker part of you see and so i can't be impossibly good it's impossible but good news he can be amen he can be the one that you're serving today is impossibly good he is impossibly powerful he is all this and he's even more than this and you know you want you want even you want even better news than that he offers you to live inside you and be a guide and take over your life and guide you into the path of righteousness that's his offer today he offers here is this impossibly powerful impossibly good perfect being and he's literally offering to manage your whole life [Music] did i bring you the gospel today is that good news i'm here to tell you according to his word this impossibly good and possibly powerful god is willing to come in and manage your whole life if you'll let him amen if you'll let him amen second peter you don't need don't need to turn to it's going to read it quickly second peter 1 8 and 10 for if these things we read this in our last series if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren or unfruitful and therefore he says in verse 10 give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall what a promise so you know i would say and i know this is true for me and i'm sure i'm not unique in this i'm sure it's true for you we hate disappointing those we love and care about yes amen that's right we should have 100 amen on that unless you are the most self-centered person in the world we hate disappointing those we love and care about we hate it about ourselves you know if you've any kind of character about you at all you care about those you love see you and and you loathe failing them you loathe failing them there's nothing that can make you more miserable than to fail those you love and especially if they suffer a calamity or suffer a tragedy at your hands and you know it was me i was asleep at the switch see and so imagine imagine being a person as peter said imagine if you will being a person who would never fall amen overcoming the greatest rub in your whole life that you can live in such a way that you can always meet the expectations of righteousness you can always be and allow god you can allow god to that in that empirical truth that intrinsic truth that exists in him it can exist in you and you can be a pure real authentic full of love full of grace full of holiness full of righteousness full of power full of authority you know when when somebody comes to me calls me meets me text me whatever brother jason pray you know why they do that because they have confidence and my authority to get a prayer answered amen they've seen over the years that god answers my prayers and i'm here to tell you he answers yours too he answers yours too and just just realized that god has this purpose for all of our lives that we reach a place where we stop failure in our lives in our homes wouldn't that be wonderful friends if in your life and your family i don't care what kind of chaos it's in now what if today you could put a complete arrest and stop on all failure and all consequences and all miseries and you your family your loved ones everyone this whole church could rise up in perfect faith and take possession of the authority of god i'm not preaching a pipe dream i'm preaching what's possible in god's word see impossible you say well for you yes but for him nothing is impossible all right i'm gonna turn the corner and run for home you got 15 minutes it's also impossible for god to be mocked for whatever we sow we reap galatians 6 7 you cannot you say what what is whole what if you sow your eep that's rather archaic language what do you mean what do you mean if i sow it's a farmer's language yeah see it you cannot plant seed in the garden of life and fail to grow a crop because you put seed in the ground it'll grow you understand it's it's the imperishable seed the gospel is the is the imperishable seed and that's why he says listen stop stop letting the devil put seeds of doubt and seeds of discrepancy and you stop allowing it in your life in your home you have the power to cut off seeds of discrepancy and start sowing the imperishable seed in your home and you know what you'll see you'll see a crop start growing in your children and in your marriage and in your finances and in your in your social activities your friendships and you'll find the glory of god coming down beaming through out of you to those you love and you'll be a benefit [Applause] of a hindrance you cannot sow and fail to reap and you cannot sow a crop of sin hear me young people particularly you just came out of camp you know i hope you know here's something i hope that all you teenagers saw i'm sure you saw many things at camp i hope this didn't escape you you're not in this alone you set among hundreds of other like-minded young men and young women from all over and and i can tell you what if we had the capacity we could have probably filled that camp up with a thousand of you and the message that you should get is i am not alone and i'm not gonna let the devil keep lying to me that i'm all alone you're not alone god has young men and young women around the world who lift up holy hands see amen that's why we're going to do more of it we're going to do that again we're going to do more than that again see because we care about you and so hear me when i say that you cannot sow a crop of sin and fail to take in the awful consequences that is impossible that is completely impossible you will most certainly reap what you sow later than you sow right but more than you sow you get that whatever you sow you'll reap now you'll reap it later but when you reap it it'll be more than you sowed you'll go my goodness what i did wasn't even that bad how is it like 10 times worse because that's the law of nature you sow one grain and you grow a whole ear of corn with all kinds of grains hundreds of grains from that one see and so you saw a few apple seeds look how many apples you grow when you grow that tree how many limbs it has how many branches it has look how much fruit it produces and all came from just a couple of seed you put in the earth and it followed god's laws see luke 17 6 brother brad give me that one we'll read this one together and then we'll hit jeremiah 32 and read that one together luke 17 6 i've got 10 minutes help me lord all right and the lord said saint luke chapter 17 verse 6 and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed you might say unto the sycamore tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you amen and another place he talks about doing that to a mountain a mountain see you'd say to that mountain that's in your way from serving god and many of us have big old mountains and they've been there a long time but jesus said if you have perfect faith just as a no bigger than a grain of mustard seed you could actually speak to that mountain and god would move it amen jeremiah 32 17 ah lord god i behold that thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm and there is nothing too hard for thee this is jeremiah's understanding look at it again lord behold thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm and there is nothing too hard for thee so when you you know when you go and read we won't turn to it but when you go and read the faith chapter we call it the faith chapter hebrews 11 by faith by faith by faith this one did this one did this one you can be left astonished reading that at just how powerful god is you go home today and take a fresh read of the 11th chapter of hebrews it is it is one of the most supernatural testimonies of the supernatural you're ever going to read no you you stack up a thousand comic books you'd never find a superhero with that kind of power of what some of these people pulled off it is it is incredible when you read that 11th chapter of hebrews but it's not your power it wasn't their power doing it it was god's power that is revealed or manifested or uncorked in you it's god's faith it's his revealed faith working in his family he's got a he's got an entire six 000 years of superheroes he can tell you about see now give me my powerpoint brothers if we can have the powerpoint that'd be awesome and i just got a couple quotes i want you to read from his expectancy 1953 in the message expectancy remember we're starting at slide 8. all right we're going to read this together they'll catch up to me faith knows no defeat how many say amen faith knows no defeat faith is perfect faith brings things when there is no things to be brought amen is that pretty powerful oh i i i i i know you're hearing me read it do we got it guys get in you're going to get that up for me okay where is it it was in the one drive lobby i sent several messages indicating it this morning yeah and never mind i don't have enough time i've already promised everybody i'd be done in six minutes so you're gonna get me stoned all right no no worries i can read it's all good guys faith knows i'm gonna start again faith knows no defeat faith is perfect faith brings things when there is no things to be brought faith creates you believe a prophet faith takes doubt away takes negative and makes positive how beautiful the old man he says had a basis for faith he's talking about the the man that that had seen god he said so faith is not mythical something mentally worked up it's an absolutely fundamental result that happens in a person's heart when faith is appropriated then it is something in the person's heart but it can't be based on say well oh go touch a tree and you'll get well or pray to a post it's got to have a foundation amen it's got to have a foundation if you can if you can get down to to to like the 10th 10th one maybe 10th frame yeah yeah tenth frame when faith is appropriated do i have it controlled here let me see if i can go backwards okay no worries you can do it for me let's read this again when faith is appropriated then it is something in the person's heart but it can be based on say well go out and touch a tree and get well pray to post it's got to have a foundation now watch next next slide now here it is i want you to get it how much more foundation could you place your faith on any level than the word of god what more could you put faith in when he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away this is the being who created everything remember and the only tool he had was his word all right watch then it is a fact then it is a fact that god's word is eternal and the very world that we're sitting on top of tonight is nothing more than the word of god materialized he spoke the word and said let there be and the world came into existence all things that you see was made by faith in the spoken word of god god said let there be and he believed his own word well after redemption and a taste of god in our souls and heart how much more ought we to base our faith on what god gave us the promise for and sent jesus to die to redeem us to that promise that's what calvary was done for to redeem you to the promise any time that god is taken say any time louder any time any time that god is taken at his word on those bases it's going to bring the result that god said it would bring hallelujah amen see so you said you know you jesus said that you could actually say to a tree or say to a mountain be removed and cast into the sea jesus said that you can operate a faith that would literally move that mountain out of your way you say oh brother jason you you you my mountain is big and i've had it for a very long time but but but remember your faith is only as strong as the object of your faith and i got a question for you when the object of your faith is god then what's a mountain to god come on friends what's a mountain to god this ain't about your ability this is a promise that he redeemed you to you've been called under a perfect god keeping a perfect promise to open a perfect word to bring a perfect grace to ignite a perfect faith to take a perfect rapture to be perfectly overcomers in an impossible age this isn't a pep rally this is god's promise this is something you can sink your teeth into this is you can bet your soul on [Applause] see the problem oftentimes is you've been trying to move it and that is always a big problem yeah but i want to tell you something today i'm going to stop if you're willing musicians get ready to come back if you're willing hear me if you're willing to align your path with god's word for your life then you can speak and god will move that mountain on the authority of god's promised word i tell you that friends under the inspiration of the holy ghost who had me put it in my notes and is on me now if if if you are willing to align your life's path with god's word for your life then you can speak i don't care what your mountain is i don't care what tree you need moved i don't trees oftentimes represent men in the bible i don't care who's persecuting you i don't care what your circumstance is i don't care how long that mountain has been there and how afflicted you have been guess what get in line we've all been afflicted we've all been afflicted we've all been offended come on we've all had tragedy oh my goodness i i remember one time a young man came to see me in my office and boy if brother jewel ever described somebody well zee wells he woo that brother sit there with his head between his knees wells he wells he woo my my parents and my childhood and you just don't know and i had this and then i got done and then a church and then a preacher and then then a girlfriend and then i sit there getting more nauseated by the minute and i said brother wait right here and i ran out the door brother ready brother eddie brother ready brother dad come here come here come here what you need i said i got one of them in the office he goes one of them i go it's kind of a wink wink win he knew what i was talking about i said i need you to come back put it on him brother eddie come walking in the office and sit right down and here this brother was all despair and brother eddie just starts relaying his childhood that's all he did he didn't quote a scripture he didn't talk about the power of god he started talking about a no-good dad and an alcoholic and ran around on his mom and beat her and all these kinds of things and his mom he's drug from pillar post about 10 years old he he's he's working in cotton fields to help his mom feed the kids and the more brother eddie started talking about his life and he said one day he said one day he said i was sitting on my front porch and i was thinking about all my tragedy and he said i thought to myself ain't nobody gonna help me get out of this and if i'm gonna get out and make something out of myself i'm gonna have to pick my own self up by my bootstraps and go forward and from that day he stood up like a man he went in the navy at 17 in north africa sitting in north africa at 17 years old come back found a girl married her had children i'm the result of the steel that that put in his backbone i'm here to tell you brother eddie was a he was had no tolerance for wowzy wowzy woo come on friends if you're feeling faint over your trials consider jesus who endured such contradiction of sinners against himself come on we're sons and daughters of god let's march to zion all you got to do is give god control of your life [Applause] and then you can say to that immovable mountain that one that's been bothering you a long time why don't you get up on your feet today right now and say move mountain in the name of jesus christ i command you to move out of my way this is what the word has revealed this is what the open book the open book the opening of the seals brought back a unique time it didn't just fill you full of nonsense doctrine it filled you full of life how many want this life all you got to do is agree with it and let it be your leader let it be your guide feed on it day and night have fellowship with the being who by himself with no one to help him and his only tool was the word and he created everything let that one come and live let that being bow your heads with me whatever you choose brother kenny with your heads bowed lord i i didn't get to the end but i wanted to keep my promise and stop oh let that perfect faith lord let every man woman boy and girl think think inwardly right now could we have some real real holy ghost introspection right now let us look deep within our hearts and say lord yeah you got me today i heard things you touched things that represented pain you touched things that represented fear he touched things also that represented hope i've i've often looked at that longingly wishing oh if that could just be me if i could just have that kind of life lord i trust today that the holy ghost preaching has driven back spirits of unbelief and allowed the holy ghost to say to that child yes you can you can be that child you can oh it's not hard i'll do it all you've got to do is let me all you've got to do is surrender you and let me take over i'll fix everything i'll put you on the right path i'll forgive all your sins i'll erase all your failures they will seem as nothing when you get to the end of the way one of these days you'll cross over on the other side you'll sit down under a tree as the prophet said and the and and the and you'll you'll think about the things you went through here and the prophet said you just laugh said when you cross over the first thought that will go through your mind is why was i ever worried lord i pray that you will now anoint hearts today to reach up and believe reach reach those people lord they might not have a mountain in front of them lord they might have a mountain setting on top of them they might feel under the weight of a mountain they might feel it's impossible to go forward it's too far it's too much damage that's what moses thought that's exactly what he thought brother branham said he's 80 years old he's standing there in the wilderness one day attending another man's sheep that weren't even his he's just been reduced from a prince to a shepherd with a staff guiding another man's sheep he started thinking about his life brother branham said he said he thought about all of his failures and thought about all the years that he had wasted and he said well it's too late now i'm old and i've missed my opportunity and brother branham said the great crystal tears flowed down his face and across his beard and he said it's right then that he heard the sound of a cracking flame and he looked and he saw a mysterious thing oh god help us today lord i don't care where we are young or old may we hear the sound of the cracking flame today lord may we turn aside and say i must go and see this amazing sight it was god calling him even after all those years of what he thought was wasted years it wasn't god needed every one of them moses would need everything he learned in the first 40 years and everything he learned in the second 40 years to accomplish his third 40 years he needed to be twice as prepared as the duty in front of him i pray you will help us today lord god to be prepared this is a wicked day it's a wicked age it's over spreading the world there's fear and anxiety everywhere lord god people running crazy the god of this evil age the lid torn off of hell demon power streaming in the earth what a unique hour but your message to the bride was arise shine thy light has come you had a prophet stand in a pulpit and he preached one of the most beautiful words in language shalom good morning peace
