[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning god bless you let's stand to our feet we're going to turn to revelation chapter 2 this morning continuing on in our revelation series through the entire book of revelation not exhaustively in this class but we want to cover enough to lay in some good some good teaching give you some understanding amen teaching is what establishes us it shows us what we believe and why we believe it and the book of revelation both qualifies and quantifies and gives us con context for why we're here how we got to here what's it all about and what's ahead so it's uh certainly the bride's book at the end time we keep repeating that because it is such a paramount statement revelation chapter 2 verse 1 unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou cast not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god let's pray father we're committing ourselves into your hands for service now lord i pray that you will allow this lesson to come forth concisely lord that it might bring a benefit to our understanding we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated good to have you all here in the house of the lord for sunday school i sure appreciate it i don't really have the words to tell you how just how much i appreciate it it means a great deal to me hopefully others are coming along quickly and or at least catching the stream because we spend a lot of time laboring over this and we want to make sure that if i cook it i want to make sure you eat it amen so it's not me of course cooking it i'm just preparing the ingredients it's the lord that has to have to get it finished amen so we found in our in our previous studies when we were covering the first chapter of revelation how that it was a net it was necessary that the book begin with the revelation of jesus christ and the entire chapter in fact is laid out to that end so that we can have a clear understanding of the seven characteristics of christ which are listed in the first chapter and we then last time we did an introduction to chapter 2 and we called it a breach between chapters 1 and chapter 2 and the reason we called it a breach not necessarily to connect it in your mind to the sermon brother branham preached on the breach though he said that was to connect the ages to the seals but and i and there's a part of it of that that is relevant and i and i did mean a part of it in that way however i i also wanted to emphasize and did emphasize and restate today that you want to we needed to have that connection because it's not it wasn't going to stay in jesus christ the whole point of the book of revelation is to show the continuation of jesus christ you have the gospels for his ministry on earth you have the book of acts for the history the way the ways and the understanding of how christ poured out his spirit on the church and how he moved and the things that he taught the things that were established and the book of acts sets up the epistles that come later from the apostles people who do not like to include the book of acts might as well throw the bible away certainly the new testament because the book of acts is what connects the gospels to the epistles because the the book of acts is the epistles being lived amen so with without the book of acts then paul came to you in word only but he said i didn't come in word only and he has the book of acts to prove it amen so he came in power and demonstration as did peter and stephen and james and the different ones that it deals with in the early part of the book of acts but then of course the book of revelation was not written uh during paul's day and in fact is it was after that the apostle paul had gone home that's why paul doesn't quote from it now paul will we'll quote out of the old testament which re which is then repeated in the in the book of revelation fact is you i think um every chapter except for two chapters in the book of revelation refer back to daniel's prophecy and so everything that's in daniel's prophecy is in the book of revelation and in other various places of the old testament but we find then that that paul leaves the scene and then john with polycarp uh with polycarp was his student and then the student of polycarp was ireneus who was the messenger of the second age so this is spanning decades now but john as an elder statesman uh is after the apostle is gone he's the last one to die uh many of them have already been have been their lives have been taken and john is still alive and he he teams up with his student polycarp to gather all of the letters all of the epistles of you know that that had ever been written you know his own epistles the epistles of peter of james of jude of the of saint paul and he's actually compiling them and translating them in to make a bible and the romans catch him doing that and since christianity was considered contraband at that time they arrested him for it and they put him on the prison island of patmos and that's why john says i was on the prison i was on patmos for the word of god because he was actually translating it and uh he was working you know under the undercover and uh they caught him now isn't this amazing and you're gonna see this repeat if you if you miss this what i'm about to say a lot of the things that you see prophesied concerning the church in the new testament you're going to look at it and say wow it looks like the devil snuck up on god and put one in there and maybe god didn't account for everything that that's what the devil tries to tell you in the day and hour that you live in that well you're facing things god didn't account for in his bible that's not true that's patently untrue you're facing things that brother branham didn't didn't account for in the message that is patently false that everything that you would ever encounter from the cradle to the grave is the answer for it is in god's word a prophet even tells us how that you know if you find yourself in a very difficult situation and you don't know what to do he said go like paul said they're for our examples right paul said that right bible readers bible readers paul said the the old testament is for our examples how many know that wow i thought i was gonna have to back up and start a genesis 1-1 so brother branham now echoing that echoing that principle gives you a piece of advice he says when you get into sitch and i'm paraphrasing it don't have it in front of me but when you get in a situation and you're not sure what to do you're in a jam go back into the bible and find you a bible character who had a situation like that or similar to it and look how what he did and how god got him out of it and he said you just do the same thing and then god who can't respect persons will get you out of it as well so you can actually if you're if you're taking if you do that you can actually tell people it'll look like you're a prophet you can say god will get me out of it and here's exactly how i'll get out of it and when you do people would go wow how did you know that and i'll go well i had a prophet who told me go back into the word and saint paul had said they were for our examples and so we find out that the statement i want to make to you is this that when you look at what happened to john as a human being you could fairly say and it would not seem you know um out of the ordinary to say wow that just seems upside down that seems lord i'm just saying that seems counterintuitive to hear john was getting all the bible together and getting all the letters together he's the only one who could do it he's in translating it they're the only people in the world who can do it and you let him get arrested for real you know i didn't get arrested and put on an island they tried to kill him first and then they poked his eyes out how in the world is it but but what but what no one knew at that time was god wanted the book of revelation included and it hadn't been written by anybody so god stops john in his work his noble endeavor allows him to go to jail allows him to almost get killed boiled in oil put eyes put out put on a prison island and so then when he comes back now he can finish his work gather all the letters add the book of revelation to it and we find that while the book of revelation speaks to every age it speaks chiefly to our day because why what have i taught you john was caught up in the spirit to the lord's day amen so you understand so the book of revelation is primarily to you and i because we have arrived at the lord's day this is the time of the end of the gentiles and so when you look at the at the stories through the book of revelation and you begin to see things of the martyrdom and the noble saints of god and the things that seem to happen to the church and and then you even bring it into your day friends and you look at your life and it seems sometimes counterintuitive lord why are you letting this happen to me it doesn't make sense well it might not to you but it makes perfect sense to him because there's no accidents with god's family amen our whole objective of life is to stay out of the way be a conduit that god can flow his plan of his word through your vessel and stay out of the way don't plug up the flues don't plug up the pipe don't plug up the conduit don't put kinks in it don't feed on the things of the world and poisons and toxins and as brother branham used the old archaic term gom up the whole system you know it it it makes everything sticky it makes everything constricted it you know it's it's like you know in your in your body if you just think of the natural typing the spiritual as the bible does it refers to your body and makes a spiritual connection well what do they say happens to your body if you eat the wrong food it clogs up your arteries and then and then blood cells pile on top of blood cells and you have a suddenly you have a real serious problem and so so you don't want that to happen to you spiritually either it's not up to you to figure out your life it's not up to you to figure out you know what what should be your plans or be your dreams just relax stay humble pray let god open the doors in front of you and as he opens them then walk through them say well i i got this plan i got this plan i i want to have a certain education i want to have a certain career i want to have a certain marital life i want to have a certain status i want to have it fine nothing wrong with wanting to be and maximize every every gift that god has given you but remember you're not put here to live your life you're put here to live his life and if he blesses you in that way and opens those doors ahead if you find walk through them i've seen people become very you know fabulously successful and yet remained spiritual and so one of the things that you don't ever want to do is substitute spirituality for religiosity because i've seen many many people become very religious extremely but they don't get any more spiritual at all and you find that the fruit of their life doesn't bear spirituality and so we find then that that chapter 2 now is is solidifying that you're actually going to begin to see god operating in his body now we dealt with that last time as we showed you and i'm not going to go over them all again today but we went to revelation 2 1 and we found identifications that he had spoke about in chapter 1 verse 13. we we went to 2 3 we went to chapter 2 verses 4 to 6. we went down to chapter 2 verse 7 and you find these seven characteristics of god are now to be lived in his church and they're listed in the church age though they were previously established in chapter one why is that why did we tell you that last time so that you can identify that you're living a life of christ because your life in chapter two matches his life in chapter one amen amen and i don't care how noble you feel or how educated you might get or how profound might be your thinking if your life in chapter in the church ages doesn't match his life in the revelation chapter one you're off course friends you're off you're off the trail so so he has declared his revelation to john in chapter one to show what she the church is to be and she's to be an active manifestation catch it she's to be an active manifestation in chapters two and 3 of what he revealed himself as in chapter 1. amen jesus doesn't come and live a life in the earth in revelation 1. he's already did that in the gospels but revelation 1 opens with an understanding of his personage and all of his characteristics and chapters 2 and 3 are now designed for the church the body the bride to live out those characteristics that's the whole purpose of the holy ghost that's why the holy ghost came that's how you know you have it that's how you can that's how you are in a position that you have passed from death to life so the bride is demonstrating that he is actively operating through her she in this last day in the lord's day in the lord's day she is the voice of god to the age and her teachings and her lifestyles is god living through her so when she's the final voice to the final age she's not her own voice the church that's the mistake the church makes that's why brother branham said at the end time the church which he had been speaking through one of the unique characteristics of our day is finally he stopped speaking through the church he don't do that anymore in the after the last age because the church kicked him out and brother branham said the church is no longer his mouthpiece they have become their own mouthpiece and brother branham said going back to the book of genesis when adam sowed fig leaves brother branham said they they tr and their words even brother branham even noted that they almost rhyme he said they tr they traded leaves for creeds and he said when i read leaves he said it sounds a whole lot like creeds and he says they sow their creeds together and try to cover their shame but it no the leaf couldn't do that neither can the creeds do that it takes blood to reverse your shame amen so we find then that that the the the bride is not making the same fundamental mistake in the ages that the church makes here at the end time where they become their own voice she is the voice of god to this last age let's repeat my own note again and her teachings and her lifestyles are him speaking through her to the world amen he's trying to lead them to life and he's using you he's trying to lead the lost to life and he's using you he he he gave his you know i could say it like this that in the last day he gave his only begotten bride to lead them because he only had like the father had one begotten son christ only has one begotten bride who has become a creation of his spoken word it has brought her to life and she's the living epistle see that proves we've been restored back to paul's teaching that proves we've been restored the omega has now become the alpha because that's what the apostles taught that you are the temple of the holy ghost you are a written epistle that is to be read of all men amen all right i got five minutes let me let me let me try to get into the church age as best we can so brother branham talks about how that you know here in the statue of a perfect man so he said we started back here where was the church first founded where was the pentecostal church first founded by saint paul at ephesus the star see that's why today the azusa revivalist took the term pentecostal but it's a misnomer because they it and and i get but brother branham even uses that you know that wording he he because he's preaching to them and so he's trying to identify with them i get it but in his teaching brother brennan made it clear that that the azusa revival was not the pentecostal restoration and he said it what proved it is that they denominated and as soon as they denominated it proved that it was not all azusa was was another continuation of the restoration luther had justification wesley had sanctification the gifts of the spirit returned back to the church but the restoration could not come until elijah is on the earth and the mighty angel descends with the open book amen and so when the seals are open now elijah steps fully into his office and he's feeding the word comes from christ to the bride and you're eating the book because you must prophesy the prophet's going to go home and we don't need him to come back the voice is now in her see and so brother branham says he says all right where was the pentecostal church first founded saint paul at ephesus the star of the ephesian church age the second church age was smyrna virtue irenaeus you might hear greek scholars pronounce it irenaeus i just like brother branham's kentucky english better arrhenius the first he says the great man who held up the gospel of paul next church age in fact his arrhenius brother branham shows us was the last messenger who had a yeah it was irenaeus who had the full understanding of the godhead by the time it gets to martin it's already a little bit sideways by the time it gets to columbus it's more sideways by the time it gets to luther it's just it's gone and luther absolutely it preached a trinitarian personage of god so but irenaeus now is still holding on to it and that's why if you go to the second age you'll get you'll see it when we get to it i got to close but when we get to it you'll you'll you'll see that through the first and second age that they hadn't denied his name they'd stood for his name but then that name in ame is not mentioned anymore in any of the other ages until wesley's day when an open door is set there to restore the name of the lord jesus christ all right and so that that open door is a door that opens up at the end of the age and is never going to be shut till it till the millennium so it's the revelation of jesus christ and so that's why you had jesus name preachers coming and and water baptism in acts 2 38 that's why because that got set at the end of the sixth age and if you go back in history it wasn't like 1906 that suddenly here's old daddy seymour and he's just preaching a sermon and suddenly the building catches on fire what they think called the fire department out because people are saying this building's engulfed in flames and it building wasn't on fire at all it was the glow of the holy spirit people actually called the fire department but that did that suddenly it wasn't just in 1906 that god comes down bang here's the gift of the spirit that's historically not even how it happened years before that even the latter part of the 1800s you had men like partner and grant and men like that who preceded seymour who were actually already starting to preach the baptism of the spirit and and because why an open door had been set at the backside of the sixth age that's why brother branham said laodicea is almost could almost be thought of as just an extension of philadelphia because it's an open door that's going to go all the way into the and arrive at the day of the lord and then a prophet is going to come born out of season open the seals that last movement will reject that kick christ out a prophet will follow him out turn around and indict the church pronounce judgment upon her he'd already pronounced judgment on the nation right and now he pronounces judgment upon church systems and now he says come out of her my people and so so you realize now that the authority the the authority to indict the authority to judge by determining what is the right word and that's it god's done they're dead completely dead and that's it god's done they're dead completely dead and he's going to have to bring and it's going to go from columba it's going to go into the dark ages interestingly enough the catholic church what we call the dark ages they see that's where she established her false doctrine and and began began the beginnings of the balaamism and nicolaitanism but brother branham shows us it's not until 606 that and that's even after columba has already gone when the age of thyatira opens columbus already off the scene so they put a triple crown
