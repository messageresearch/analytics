preaching little people will start preaching now they might not get up here and read a text and say words but they're they're going to preach in a demonstrative way amen and it's the it's the gospel Jesus said go into all the world and demonstrate the gospel to every creature so we're looking forward to that today we have a lot of Fellowship planned afterwards amen and I I'm looking forward to everything I sure appreciate those wonderful songs amen all of the wonderful singing and the specials y'all owe me for all of that amen amen I'm the one who um hooked up brother Micah and sister Esther and um and then I strong armed my my granddaughter into singing Noel amen and I think she said last night she uh was part of a choir or something so she might not be able to do it but I think in the night she felt sorry for me and decided to do it amen praise the Lord amen it's nice to be loved amen praise God we're going to invite you while you're standing to Luke's gospel as you might imagine chapter 2 amen and when I um finish here um I suppose we've got a team ready to uh move move this out of the way and uh we've got a wonderful program for you amen I sure like to say how much I appreciate sister Deborah amen for her constant willingness and Readiness that can do will do and want to do spirit that she always has I told her I said Deb you come from a a long line of a long family line of people with servants Hearts so keep it going amen and we sure appreciate her for that and all of the different ones that have made it possible all of the rehearsals and the practice uh I deeply deeply appreciate that amen you love him you know what you got to do now right turn around shake hands say God bless you amen welcome to the house of the Lord amen you know you you you might not realize it but it's little things like that that keep us a family it keeps us all for one and one for all amen it keeps us all in this thing together amen are you happy to be all in it together amen amen you excuse me for not bringing my Bible up here today I have my scripture laid out here I wanted to be as light as possible so in case I transition I'm not sure how I'll transition at the end I may finish out here and if not I've got this little one in case I have to step down while they're moving and I might continue so we'll see I don't know I might just be able to finish it straight right here Luke Chapter 2 verses 1 to 20 amen I came out to hear all of the singing and forgot to put my microphone on so I'm using this one again amen but it sounded pretty good I listened back at the archive to see if it was a going to be a federal case that I used this one and it wasn't it sounded good amen praise the Lord and it came to pass Luke Luke 2 1 we're going to go 1- 20 sorry we can't display it today amen we uh have the screen covered and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when serenius was governor of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace good will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them amen I want to speak to you today on taking a title the day that changed it all amen let's pray father we thank you for your word today there's a blessing in reading your word there's a blessing in just hearing it R so we already have a double blessing Lord and now we're asking you to take the bread of life Lord and break it to us individually bring us a greater understanding of that great day that momentous day that changed it all Lord it it returned hope back it you finally were making a move Lord to redeem the whole world father I ask that you help us today to look upon this season Lord exactly for what it is and it only matters what what you say it is Lord it only matters what the the the whole Heavenly purpose behind this holiday season we know what the world has made it into Lord and we're we're not oblivious to that and we don't put our head in the sand but we struggle Lord against modern society to to keep it in remembrance as a sacred Time Lord so I pray you'll be our helper today teach us one and all in jesus' name amen God bless you friend you can be seated it was indeed a day that would change it all it would change everything it would it was the beginning of a of a new world order it was the beginning of a new Heavenly order it was the beginning it wasn't the you know the babe didn't come from a manger and go to Calvary they didn't sacrifice an infant there would be years of growth and the Bible talks about how that Jesus submitted himself unto the authority of his Earthly parents he the Bible tells us how that the child grew in wisdom and understanding the Bible tells us later on uh it became apparent to the disciples and they wrote it in the scriptures that he learned obedience by the things that he suffered and suffer he did but it changed everything it meant now that there could be a a way for God to to Jesus was the Keystone as brother Brandon would call him between the Old Testament and the New Testament these two eras of of humanity these two epochs of humanity how that God dwelt above his family but you know the reason that that was never going to be sustained was because he was he didn't start that way in the Garden of Eden he walked with them and fellowshipped with them and they lived in his realm and he lived in their realm they were even Adam was even an amateure god brother Brenham tells us how that God you know rules the universe and he did not create the Earth for himself to rule he rules it uh by proxy he rules it uh through his children he made it for man to rule and so we realize that the fall separated God and and brother brandham has very amazing language how that it it separated God from his purpose and and and but but he was always going to bring it back that was always going to be Redemption there was always going to be this child born long before Isaiah ever said it he was always going to be born I all the way back to Abel all the way back to the Tree of Life in the midst of the Garden of Eden uh it was all the way back to to Genesis 1 where there in verses 27 and 28 he starts talking about be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and brother brandham shows us and teaches us how that there in the spoken word is Original Seed series how that there was there would the only way for something to multiply would mean that something had to die so even in Genesis before the fall he's already embedding in a in in a in an encrypted way he's already embedding the the truth that there's going to be a death a burial a resurrection there's going to be a Redemption there's going to be a redeemer and that means there's going to have to be a loss amen so we find that the Garden of Eden and what happened there was not Satan catching God unaware it wasn't a sucker punch it wasn't God knew the whole thing was coming his birth was not an accident his life was not an accident his death was not an accident his resurrection was certainly not an accident it wasn't just God fixing a problem it was always part of the plan it wasn't God saying well now they've they've killed Christ so I'm going to raise him back from the dead I'll fix it I'll show them but it was always a part of the plan for him to die to be buried to be resurrected if for no other reason then someday you would go to the water and be buried beneath the water in his name and rise up identifying with his resurrection his life would come back into the church so he wouldn't just be God above and not only just God with which made it all possible but he would be God in the the the family of God would be redeemed and now here we have been spending 2,000 years in a new testament era 2,000 years where God has been filling the role of those names that were recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world they're all known of God they're all they all must be born again but they all will be born again they must be part of the first resurrection and they will be part of the first resurrection and there's nothing that you can do to separate your self from that love that was in Christ Jesus that knew you before the Earth even existed there's a colloquial term called EB and flow it's an expression that's been used for many many hundreds of years and it refers to the Natural rise and fall or the fluctuation of something over time it originated from the movement of the ocean tide Zeb meaning the the tide going out receding and flow meaning the tide coming in or Rising its literal origin in its literal origin it describes the rhythmic movement of Tides symbolizing consistent catch this consistent yet opposing forces so it's it it it moves out it comes back in it moves out it comes back in and there's a power and the Moon is involved in that call and brother bam shows us how that if the if God didn't bring the moon back around to to look at the ocean then he said the the incoming tide would just cover the Earth again but God set laws in the heavens and nature flows es and flows according to the laws that God set in motion even broken it still tries to worship him even broken nature still rejoices at God the son Rises and declares his glory to the whole world every day the leaves clap their hands and the birds sing Oh friends even even in a broken World nature knows who made it in a figurative meaning e and flow is often used to describe Cycles or patterns and changes that are not not always consistent but they occur regularly or they occur naturally there is as we would be familiar with the EB and flow of Rel in relationships the EB and flow of a friendship would then refer to how closeness and then distance might naturally alternate over time in business the market experiences an EB and flow it describes times of decline it Des it describes times of growth uh life events the EB and flow we have an EB and flow of emotions and this refers to a lot of times how feelings can intensify and then diminish and it's natural that's not unnatural for that to happen this is exactly why that you when you you know and this is not in my notes this one's free today this is why young men and young women should find thus sayith the Lord for their Eternal mate because and flow will rise and diminish that affection you feel but true Oneness true eternal love is never ending because that's not from this broken realm that's from that realm living out down here so it highlights a rhythm it highlights um a a balance between opposing States and and suggesting that if I'd say say it like this and and some people really don't like like this reality but it's true we face it every day change is inevitable amen but here's what you want to realize in change that it's part of a larger pattern there really are especially I can say this now because a prophet said concerning God's family there are no accidents amen the footsteps of the righteous are ordered over the Lord and I cannot explain to you why your life before Christ went the direction is sometimes we look for answers that are on the other side and we won't get them till we get there I don't know why things turned out maybe you made choices maybe we'll find out we'll understand it better by and by but I know this God always knew where you were he knew when he was going to find you he knew how to how to pull it off and you had no chance to get away thank god brother brandham called eban Flo as we're describing it brother brandham called it the law of contrast that we live by there cannot be the level of enjoyment that we have of a of a bright sunny day without a rainy day we we get that we get that right now see and so you know you cannot fully enjoy good health without experiencing the contrast of illness you say well I just like to be well all the time someday you will you know and I don't know how this is going to work I'll admit to you today I've thought a lot about this over the years will this law of contrast because in heaven I'm not going to need that law of contrast I'm not going to need to be sick to appreciate being well I'm not going to need a rainy day to appreciate a sunny day I'm not going to need the devil to appreciate Christ I'm going to live in a world where the devil doesn't exist where rainy days and Gloom do not exist I'm going to live in a world where all is peace forever more on that happy Golden Shore there is no character apart from suffering ing amen we know and we talk often about the suffering of the Cross but today you're going to see a depiction that there was suffering before the cross brother Brandon would say teach us that there's no character apart from suffering in the seven Church ages book he says it this way his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would would be made perfect you in amen you want to be made perfect how many's in say I'm all in if it means I can be perfect Count Me In sign me up am amen that after a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled Grant it Lord Jesus as job said he puts strength in us there in job 23 you see he him himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered now Jesus didn't need to be born again but Jesus needed to live under the law of contrast so that he could be a faithful high priest when you have to live under it and he was tempted and suffered in all wise as we could ever tempted and suffered I want you to know you have a faithful high priest it was made perfect by the things that he suffered Hebrews 5:8-9 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering all right now you ready for some you ready for a change you ready for some EB and flow amen and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection how many's all in I'm not praying for trials I'm not recommending you pray for trials but I know this I want to have faith in him while I'm suffering but and let me know that it's going to be for my perfection we we often sing the song Silent Night and it's a very beautiful song it's very old song was written many years ago and it's a very beautiful song and and I don't have any clue it might be in the in the program for today I hav't a clue I don't know but I do know that one of the songs that's going to be sung and the children are going to act this portion Out Sister Deborah has some other things with this I'm not going to get into all of that uh I'll let you be um surprised and amazed as it happens but I want you to think about the lyrics that brother Steve and sister Emily are going to sing as part of the program and they her song interconnects with the program and you'll understand all of that as it goes the song is titled it was not a silent night it was not a silent night there was blood on the ground you could hear a woman cry in the alleyway that night on the streets of David's town down and the stable was not clean and the cobblestones were cold little Mary full of Faith with tears upon her face had no Mother's hand to hold it was a labor of pain it was a cold sky above but for the girl on the ground in the dark Every Beat of her beautiful heart was a labor of love Noble Joseph by her side calloused hands and weary eyes there were no midwives to be found in the streets of David's town in the middle of the night so he held her and he prayed shafts of Moonlight on his face but the baby in the womb he was the maker of the Moon he was the author of faith that could make the mountains move oh it was a labor of pain it was a cold sky above but for the but for the girl on the ground in the dark Every Beat of her beautiful heart it was a labor of love little Mary full of Faith with tears upon her face was a labor of love it was not a Silent Night on the streets of David's Town brother brandham says in God's gifts always find their places December the 22nd 1963 today's actual date all those years ago he says we realize over here in St John 12 you remember this is where she came with the alabaster to anoint him for his burial St John 12 we find out that this woman brought this myrr that anointed costly something to make the smell of death away and she broke this Alabaster Box and poured it upon the head of Jesus and Judas said why this ought to have been given to the poor said not that he had respect for the poor but he was a thief to begin with he carried the money and said this ought to have been sold instead have put it and Jesus said let her alone for she did this she anointed him unto his burial you know this woman whether it was this woman whether it was Mary whether it was the bride like Mary who says be it unto me according to Thy word he has left us a measure of suffering he's Desiring he suffered and we suffer but together we have a new world coming friends and that more that that night when Angels sang changed everything for the world Jesus said let her alone for she did this she anointed him un his burial this woman so grateful so grateful that her s sins were forgiven oh my when I when I pasted that quote into my notes the AI writing tool didn't know what to do with it it had all kinds of suggestion but when it got to the to the term were forgiven her sins were forgiven and it had it underlined and so I said what would it want to change and I clicked on it and said no suggestions oh my my sins were forgiven and nobody can understand it even I can't understand it but there's one who understands why he did it Allelujah he said she was so grateful that her sins were forgiven until she spent all of her money she had and took an alabaster box broke it and poured the oil and just odored the room with fine smell of this myrr that she had anointed him for his death now see she did the service not knowing what she was doing how many can relate to that sometimes you just feel compelled by the Holy Spirit she didn't know what she was doing but she was so grateful to God and if you're so grateful for Christmas see we're grateful we're here today we're excited this is a wonderful day Christmas is coming it's a joyous time if you're so grateful for Christmas it's not to say I give Jones's a gift and they give me one back I'll see what I got in the morning why don't you open up your heart and see what's in there amen find out what's you got in here and except if you if we find it empty with just negative Creeds and cares of the world why not ask Christ to fill it tonight amen tonight see I'd say to you today tonight today so that you can ask Christ to fill it so that you can get the real meaning of Christmas amen here it is it's Christ in you God dwelling in the human heart that's what the real Christmas Means brother brandom goes on but you see today we become so negative now when I when I read that I my human sense thought you know this seems inside out that we make it so negative I mean because we make Christmas a festive time of joy and a prophet is it seems inside out what he's saying like it's upside down we make it so negative why would he call it negative we make it a festive time of family and friends and food and gifts and joy and and people greet you and everybody's in a friendly Mo uh mood and why would he call it negative you know can I just say it like this and and and I just speak to you from my heart today brother brandham was not an unfeeling manen amen he was a Man Who Loved people and dedicated his entire life to the service of humanity he had a soft spot for little children he had been a child once and you know as he grew up he tells about how that nobody wanted to have anything to do with him his his family uh had a bad name in the hills and Backwoods of Kentucky so we don't judge him as a man when would say Christmas is for children yeah it's for the kitties sister Rebecca wrote in her only believe magazine she said the the last time he made that statement before his death he came in to the house and he had went out and had a little tree and some little decorations and he said we've got to have this for the kitties and she said the kitties Joseph 10 Sarah 14 and me 18 amen amen for the kitty so we don't judge him as a man when he said Christmas is for children can I say to you today that he didn't stop being a prophet when he handed out presents to his family from under a decorated tree amen that's right that's a Bonafide fact and he didn't stop being a prophet when he did it amen sister Jean has personally seen the family films of that it's for children only that we tell them the truth about Santa otherwise brother brandham said if you don't tell them the truth about Santa they may grow up and when they discover Santa to be false they may say well what about this Jesus that's right is he false too amen we struggle as I've already said we struggle against modern society to remember that it is a sacred day we freely join in the Glorious news I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born a savior we rejoice in that a multitude of heavenly host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men the world celebrates the birth of the Savior to a degree I suppose it's getting less and less but there are still some mangor scenes on The Lawns of scattered churches here and there and occasionally you'll see a mangor scene on on the somebody's front yard I remember brother Donnie years ago he said you know he said uh he would he read a quote where brother brandham talks about how that that at the end time Christ is making himself fully I'm not quoting it exactly but Christ is revealing himself fully in a bride and and brother Donnie said they're all out there looking looking at a Manger at a baby he said I think he said I told Carol I'm going to go out to that manger and lay down in it but even with that even with the occasional manger scene that we see the real meaning the real meaning of Christmas has been covered over and hidden and it would take a prophit I suggest you today it would take a prophet with enough courage to brush aside all the man-made debris and uncover the original plan of God for the birth of Christ but you see today we we become so negative he says the devil getting us through there there's there's painted candy sticks and a reindeer and a whiskered man that flies through the air like an airplane and visits the whole world and every home with a little bundle of toys on his back and visits every child and it's just a lie it's just right out a lie amen but why fair question but why the devil did that so he could twist the minds of people can you imagine that Jesus who died for the sins of the whole world to give the gift of eternal life and it gets reduced to Santa Claus traveling the whole world handing out toys tonight and I say it again today get the real meaning of Christmas Christ in you God dwelling in the human heart that's what the real Christmas Means amen let's stand to our feet I'm I'm going to uh ask the team to come and start the transition I don't know if maybe we need a a song where's Deb or yet sister Deb so uh okay so I'm guessing they're going to get geared up maybe brother Tony uh maybe you'll come back up and and sing a song as we transition over do you get it today friends amen do you get the real meaning of Christmas see now what you're about to see from here is what I just preached demonstrated and you're going to hear that song you hear those lyrics again and let it be today let it be today that we follow a prophet and brush aside all of the debris brush aside I get that we are going to have a good time and we're going to have family and we're going to have food and we're going to have gifts but don't don't lose sight of the fact that Christmas didn't Christmas the way you notice that they've had it for all these years and it doesn't change anything about the world but the real Christmas changed everything it changed it all friends when God does it that's far different than man doing it amen praise the Lord God bless you for for [Music]

our Guiding Light to welcome the Savior our Guiding Light [Music] [Applause] [Music] So This Time of the Season as we focus our thinking towards Christmas it's too bad that we have to lot it to a myth called Santa Claus and the stead of the real Christmas as it's supposed to be many little children in the land today know nothing more than Christmas Means A Sligh full of toys and some Mystic reindeers pouncing on the house to only learn later of this myth to even hurt their faith when it comes to know the true Christmas story that it had nothing to do with reindeers or a man smoking a pipe with fur around his coat it was the birth of our blessed Lord Jesus and it's most unusual to see how God worked in this manner because no other time would have ever worked in all the history of the world it had to be just exactly at this time and now for a few moments let's just look right at the seasons it was a time that when Herod the murder was King it had to be this heartless man had to be king at the time for we're acquainted with the scriptures that said he slew all the children from 2y old down trying to find the Christ and then there had to be at the time that there had to raise a taxation to cause Mary and Joseph to go back to their hometown of Bethlehem where they were registered and their births was on the record of the courts and in the temple to be taxed and Christ was to be born in Bethlehem and they were many miles away when this took place and we been notice at The Perils they had to go through in order to get there now they didn't have a great fine plush ambulance to take Mary up there no comfort for the little expecting mother and no way of travel only by foot or on the back of a little donkey and if anyone ever rode a donkey knows what a rough ride that is the little fella along a narrow trail that wind up over the mountains coming to Bethlehem from lower Judea very rough and rugged Road what if the little donkey would not not have been surefooted and would have fell with this little expecting mother or in the days when there was so much travel coming into their homelands the whole country was working alive with pilgrims and travelers back to the Homeland a very good setup for robbers in those days when they seen the little Caravans of small peoples the Riders are robbers could have rode right in and slew them and tucked their goods and went off also what if some of the wild beasts which there was lions and many destroying wild animals that roamed in the deserts that they had to cross what if a wild beast would have tucked towards the little party what could Joseph have done with a stick in his hand and a wife that could hardly move what a thing it was to this young married couple that they had to face and how it would have been but it gives us consolation to know this that we do not hold our destiny god holds our destiny and he has ordained it to be so oh and there's nothing will ever interrupt the program of God Amen we are bound to rise and there were to be no fear and yet maybe Mary and Joseph themselves just common people not educated and they didn't have the way of knowing these things that were taking place right at that time was fulfilling the scriptures and it's the same today that things are taking place right in this day that we live in and many of us know nothing about it how God is moving that's [Music] it was not a silent night there was blood on the ground you could hear a woman cry in the Alleyways that night on the streets of David's [Music] town and the stable was not clean and the cobblestones were cold little Mary full of Faith with the tears upon her face and no Mother's hand [Music] hold it was a labor of pain it was a cold sky above for the girl on the ground in the dark Every Beat of her beautiful heart he was a labor of love Noble Joseph by her side callous hands and wey eyes [Music] there were no midwives to be found on the streets of David's town in the middle of the night so he held her and he prayed shafts of Moonlight on his face but the baby in her womb he was the maker of the Moon he was the author of The F that could make the mountains [Music] move oh [Music] it was a labor of pain was a cold sky above before the girl on the ground in the dark Every Beat of her beautiful heart was a labor of love little Mary full of Faith with the tears
