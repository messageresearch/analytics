of other prayer requests that you were praying about but i got a request from sister becky coffey mr debbie got it actually this morning can you please have your church pray especially for brother tim arrowood from johnson city i assume he goes to brother donnie's church our dear friends and he lived with us for a while after he was baptized in our church in ohio so this is way back in the day when brother berry is pastoring in ohio he is an icu on high oxygen flow with double covered pneumonia listed in critical condition and not doing good at all well prayer changes things doesn't it prayer changes everything so i'm glad for that i think that we should believe god for all i believe we should believe him to keep his promises he is more than able and and already willing there's no question in the bible when you read the life of jesus in the gospels there's no time he was not willing to heal somebody that wanted him to heal them he's always willing don't ever let the devil say it might not be his will to heal you brother branham makes one quote he said i mean he had people lined up and they went all the way down the wall and out the door and brother branham said i'm just as convinced that he's willing to heal every single person in this prayer line as i've ever been of anything so we find that whenever he was asked lord if thou will thou can make me whole and he said i will be thou whole so we want to ask the lord on behalf of this poor brother and of course they've had uh uh some problems i the last report i got is that it was starting to improve uh i guess somebody came in and they had it and it kind of spread through really quick and uh they had to cancel a couple of services i think they've got it under control and it's already uh beginning to improve was the last word i got i want to keep praying for sister meredith's parents up there and um but uh all is well they're doing good and so we're just thanking the lord for that amen matthew 24 i just want to read the first two verses and we will let you be seated we're going to read a lot of scriptures today so i'm just going to read this and let you be seated straight away matthew 24 verse 1 and 2. jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the building buildings of the temple and jesus said unto them see you not all these things verily or truly i say unto you there shall not be here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down amen let's pray father we're thanking you for the reading of your word today i thank you for your reliable way lord and your faithfulness to grant to me the direction for this morning and lord it's been a curious week for me thinking upon this thought i've had the thought all week all the way from nearly as soon as i got home sunday evening or maybe early monday morning i can't even remember but you just exploded it to me and lord i've thought on it throughout the entire week and it seems the enemies fought it but that's okay he ain't nobody and we're here as your servants this morning grateful that i believe i have your perfect mind for the lesson this morning now lord we commit it to you and i ask for this special prayer request you've already heard other prayer requests that were offered we pray for your mercy in these cases we pray for assemblies who are suffering under this lord this virus and we pray for uh our different ones that we're continuing to pray for sister karen pruitt we're continuing to pray for our own brother joe we want to see complete regeneration of lung tissue we want to see complete regeneration of brain cells for our sister karen we want to see a complete total deliverance lord for your people i'm praying for brother tim arrow wood lord i don't think i know him but you know him lord and so we've been asked to pray and as a church we offer this prayer up to you calling his name asking you to be kind to him now lord and help him lord it's a very dire situation and we're looking to the mercies of christ granted lord may you may you continue to improve the situation there in happy valley we thank you for it lord and we're asking now that you be with us in the word today in jesus name amen god bless you can be seated amen we spoke to you about the waters of separation some time ago and i i want to take a um a rather odd little trek uh this morning if i could call it odd i guess you know the lord being mysterious being god being god he does things that are his ways are above our ways and past finding out so i just want you to give me your undivided attention for a little while um because this thought has been difficult coming it seemed to explode to me right off the bat in the early part of the week and then it just seemed like that uh the lord wanted me to ruminate on what he gave me on that first initial uh unveiling and quite an unveiling it was it didn't it wasn't a short thing it went on for a little while and i was you know typing as fast as i could to keep up with the holy spirit and then it just seemed like the lord wanted me to take the whole week and ponder its ramifications and it was only really two o'clock this morning i was awakened out of complete sleep went to sleep around 9 9 30 walked straight up at 2 am and the lord speaking to my heart and i immediately went into the living room and got the got what i've been waiting all week for so we're thanking the lord for it and it's meant quite a bit to me to study it these are exceptional times friends and we're in a day and now i suppose that if a preacher at least me you know i i think that that's one of the paramount if i could use that word that for you to be able to recognize your day and its message for you now that's that's not a cliche i'm meaning for you to see where we are in the word right now on august 1 2021 all right and your place in that because i can tell you you have a place in it and god it has a very specific way he wants you to be operating and if you're not operating in that way in that channel in that line then you're you're gonna you're gonna suffer for it not i don't mean god's reaching out and slapping you around i mean you're gonna miss out on blessings you're gonna miss out on power you're gonna miss out on accomplishment and it and the sad part for any preacher i suppose especially a preacher with as a shepherd with a shepherd's heart is when i see people miss out and i say to myself it need not have been that is that is that is impossibly difficult for me to describe to you what uh angst that gives me to see you suffer and not or to see you miss an opportunity or to see the devil be able to have some victory when it need not beat or see you suffer uh maybe it's not has anything to do might not have anything to do with the trial it might just simply be god needs to teach you a lesson you should have took two steps forward and took a right and then left and then went straight instead you went two steps backwards went left left left left up right and you're just all over the map and god is saying okay stop hold it time wait okay i'm gonna have to rough you up a little bit and get you to learn to do things my way and it you know it's not it's it's love it's love that does that it's not the curse of god it's love and so you know i've often made the comment i've learned it by experience that sometimes though the exact perfect will of god can be difficult to discern but boy you'll know it if you miss it i mean like that as soon as you miss it you realize oh wow i missed that one and i've had that experience more times than i'm comfortable admitting and so you know you want to know what's up what lord what's up where do i need to be what do i need to be doing what do i need to know uh the the the first thing when the seal each seal was open those first four seals as soon as john says when one of the creatures opened the seal the first words of instruction were come and see so we need to see the lord in his movements because remember that when the seventh seal unveiled the mighty god when it unsealed god the mystery of god it also unsealed a bride who was part of that mystery amen so jesus doesn't feel the need nor does he plan to move through this earth and a nail scarred body he shouldn't have to he already accomplished his work in that body he likes to move in your body amen now that's wonderful because since he already lived calvary in his body you don't have to worry about doing that that's already accomplished for you but now he wants you to live out his word think about it friends he's the he's a high priest of our of our confession right doesn't the bible describe him that because that he went through because he was tempted like you and i then he can be a faithful high priest who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities because he went through things all right well guess what he didn't he didn't live here in 2021 he didn't live in satan's eden he didn't he lived 2000 years ago so how would he know what it's like living here unless he knows it living through you amen so you're actually helping him be a faithful high priest you're part of that godhead the bride is part of god's godhead that's a direct quote amen so when you realize that then take on to yourself the responsibility of being the word made flesh when jesus was the word made flesh he comes to this point and he goes back to pick up a prophecy sacrifices and offerings those had no pleasure that was never your plan that was just you in kindness giving man a substitute till you could get to the real thing you passed over judgment knowing that you would finally bring it on to christ and he would suffer all the judgment and so the bible teaches that that he wouldn't he just kept passing over judgment and generation kept living and his family kept going and he just passed over judgment they were all born in sin and there was no way they could do enough good to stand in his presence but rather than than judgment to destroy them for their sin the bible teaches us that he passed over it it just kept passing over it passing over it he delayed his judgment delayed his judgment because he knew what job caught i know someday my redeemer will stand on the earth and god knew that and so god knew that someday i can i can put my family in paradise i can't bring them to heaven i'll put them down in the in in into the lower parts of the earth in a paradise and i won't judge them for being born in sin because someday i'm going to come as the lamb and i'm going to atone for it all and then i can go get them and i can bring them home hallelujah i'm here to tell you in that second exodus egypt coming out of uh israel coming out of egypt being the first that second exodus on that day of the resurrection today there's a third exodus and he has done the exact same thing he has sent a prophet with a pillar of fire and a bleeding word and that word is life and liberty to you so that he can he can take you with all your bumps and knots and wrinkles and warts and ups and downs and ins and outs and weaknesses and transgressions and sins and stupidity and just say i've perfected you in christ it doesn't matter come on home hallelujah because why you have believed the word you have accepted the atoning bleeding word there are multiple categories today of humanity at the end time of which concerning them all the lord is fully aware all of which god is dealing with and speaking to speaking to even if even if only warning and instructing them how to escape the judgments that are coming you remember i put that up twice two services in a row to show you that god was speaking to the false church to warn it how to escape judgments remember god's still in the mercy business and he's still trying to save everybody that will accept it this thing ain't over friends so let's continue to preach the gospel of grace and mercy let's continue to reach out to the world with the truth of this hour and so we realize that he is dealing and speaking to them even if it's just to warn them instruct them on how to escape judgments that are coming but only in the bride but only the bride is he speaking through there's a big difference in speaking too and speaking through amen so we see in our various categories and i'm not going to get into the law all today we see the jews you know down through the ages were given white robes and are under the altar of god they all are they're in different places the brother branham when he went beyond the curtain of time he said i want to see jesus said no he's up higher so he's in an under an altar brother branham when he went there didn't see luther or wesley he saw his own converts see and he says i saw you there i love that one and so and so we we realized that they're all segmented and and in their place under the altar and you know even i mean that's that's why the under the fifth seal when when the the seventh you know when when the trumpets and seals are all running together and you find that under the fifth seal you have those jews who have suffered down through the ages since since the days of jesus warning right here in matthew 24 he starts warning then we're going to cover in a minute and then all the way down through the ages it wasn't just hitler nikon that persecuted them they've been scattered and persecuted for 2000 years you see and so here suddenly god sends a seventh messenger to the gentiles with a message of the open book and then and then a bride is ready for a body change but god can't change her bodies until he sends those six dimension saints back because the dead in christ shall rise first and when they start leaving and heading down to pick up their body and here's these jews saying what about us and and they're told no no you this gentiles you've got to stay a little while longer because your brethren have to suffer the tribulation there's 144 000 of them who haven't bowed to political nonsense and haven't taken the mark of the beast like god told elijah i have 7 000 still who have not bowed the knee to baal and so they're told you must wait a little while uh until your brethren uh have been uh finished till that cycle to get them has been finished and so we see that they're given white robes for the gospel for the for the truth that they held uh not not christ they didn't have a testimony of christ it said for the testimony that they held that they they held the testimony of jehovah that they had gotten from moses and they were true they weren't just political jews they were actual hebrews sons of abraham all right and then of course you have the unwise virgin who are are granted to wash their robes in the blood of the lamb by enduring the tribulation period and you find when you look back in genesis that god helps them during that time we see just as he saw god helping lot you know to save him from from destruction in this case he the the hunter the foolish virgin are going to have to give their lives but they're safe from eternal destruction they're they're saved from eternal destruction you see and you can see the types of that you see god helping lot and and and because when you go into genesis and you look at the conversation between lot and and that one being it's not the two angels anymore they're they're actually gone and now there's a single being who's identifying himself as the one that met abraham he's the same god and and lot is saying sir please let me go into the city and he says all right go because i can't destroy until you're safe so we find these types and shadows and these allegories where god god does even in the tribulation when the when the beast you know gushes of a torrent of water and the bible says the earth opens up and swallows the water so we don't know how it's all going to pan out i'm not here to teach on that today but we do know that god has a place they gain entrance into eternal life in heaven at the end of the bride's 1000 year honeymoon amen the gentile elected bride have no need like like these unwise virgins who have washed their robes in the blood of the lamb the gentile elected bride have no need to do that to wash her robes in the blood of the lamb because she is the blood of god by the spirit yes amen which is a direct quote she is the blood of god by the spirit by the indwelling revealed faith in the living bleeding washing word amen amen amen and that's why when people leave the living bleeding washing word they backslide amen and so far it's never not happened because why they left the life source and they stopped coming in two and three times a week to get washed up you see and so they just get worse and worse and worse so there is a there is a value in the living word it's a bleeding word it's a washing word it's a faith-giving word it's the only word god can bring revelation through all right so we find that that that this bride is part of the word in redemption so in effect she is the blood of god by the spirit she carries his life and the new testament baptism of the holy ghost in a new birth isn't that beautiful and so she's already judged in christ all unbelief has been annihilated from her soul and her mind is regularly washed clean by the washing of the water of the word for her day which is a water of separation amen right now i read this to you uh some time ago i decided not to put it up today because i don't want to read it in its entirety and skip over it but brother branham takes this thought in thinking man's filter in exodus 19 he refers to about the waters of separation he talks about how the the they have the red heifer and it had to be red and the color of red is an atonement and he says science knows that if you take red and look through red to red it's white so so listen friends i i know that you're sinners saved by grace and i know you still have your ups and downs and so do i and i know that sometimes we're like elijah men of like passions come on all you holy people but thanks be to god he looks at your red mistakes through his red blood and he sees white just rejoice in that just rest in that don't let your mistakes and weaknesses hold you back from accomplishing what god wants you to accomplish because it can and it will if you let it don't let it just say lord i am your son and here's what i know i don't know why i did that but i do know i'm your son i i don't know why i make so many mistakes but i know i believe your word hallelujah and i know it's the desire of my heart to live perfectly and god knows that and i've often been so glad he knows my heart like peter said lord you know i love you aren't you glad for that if i offended you i'd have to explain it to you and get you to love me again and then if i did it twice i'd have to really explain it to you and then if i did it seven times and then if i did it 70 times seven by that time you don't want to hear me i've seen situations so bad where somebody says i didn't want to hear you say sorry i don't even want to hear you say those words amen but you know i i love the fact that when i can come to him and i can say to him i i you know and i'm trying if i've stumbled i i don't have to sit down and think up some flowery speech some crafted you know penmanship and word art to to convince him lord i actually do love you i really am sorry oh after a while he wouldn't want to see your little drawings of hearts and he wouldn't want to hear apologies and he wouldn't want to hear anything and you know that's what the jews kept trying to do and you know what happened he said i don't want your sacrifices anymore they stink it makes me nauseated stop bringing them because all you do is go back and do it again you see why paul kept trying to tell the jews that's a that's not a perfect system it can never bring the worshiper there unto perfect if it could why do you keep going back every year to redo it but god promised that the atonement that was coming would be once for all amen that would settle it before god and you would forever stand in the presence of god perfect in christ so so this is how to stand clean and acceptable before god to receive his bleeding word that washes you clean brother branham said he looks through red blood of the lord jesus and and our red sins become white as snow red through red and the heifer was killed in the evening time that's so relevant to us let me skip down all right and so he said a clean man clean hands had to keep it in a clean place so clean clean clean all right not a place where jezebels and ricky's and everything partaking the communion and things and they're running around with wives and husbands and all kinds of filth going on and dances and parties and wearing bob hair and shorts and everything else and call themselves christians so these people go to church yeah who who goes to church these ones that run around with other wives and other husbands and all kinds of filth they go to church oh yeah they go to dances and parties i thought you said they go to church they do they also go to dances and parties and they wear bobbed hair and they wear shorts and everything and call themselves christians see but brother branham said that the atonement can't be there because in exodus 19 it had to be held and cleaned by clean hands and put in a clean place see so i don't care how bad the the nominal christian world don't like to hear me preaching against sinful lifestyle i'm sorry but if you're not living a righteous lifestyle you have no access to the atoning power of christ i know you make mistakes but it can't be in your heart to do that in your heart you've got to he that's born of god does not commit sin the desire's gone see so he has no more conscience of sin his that means his desire for sin is gone and if and if you're still struggling against and i'm not talking about your fallen flesh that gets tempted i'm talking about if in your heart this is just a social gathering for you and you gather here because you like to have some place to go and you like the people and you love the people and we probably love you too and you think we're great and we probably think you're great but if that's your only purpose in being here and you never let the word take over your life you're going to go into a tribulation having me as your pastor won't save you believing brother branham was a prophet won't save you that won't save you at all you'll go right into a tribulation period see and so so he says so before they could fellowship in worship the the the people had to pass through these waters of separation see it talks about the seven stripes of blood because that's uh to all seven ages and now we want to look at ephesians 5 26 and it's the washing of the water by the word of waters of separation what does it do then the filter of god is the word waters of separation washing of the waters of separation by the word god's filter then you can't come into christ through a church filter you cannot come by a denominational filter or a creed filter there is only one filter that you can enter into that holy place that's through the washing of the water by the word the word of god is a thinking man's filter so when we talk about coming to the waters of separation then then that compels progress or it compels forward movement because you've got to constantly come to god you've got to constantly move in his channels you you know that paul will use language like press toward you know i i mean i can't press on that door from here i've tried to operate the force i can't get it to work some sometimes my grandkids will see me drop something they'll go to pick it up and say wait a minute try the force still can't make it work someday i will amen i i read i read actually a testimony of the guy who wrote all of that whole futuristic series and he actually admitted he took it right out of the bible yeah confessed it he said oh yeah good and evil light and darkness luke vader all those guys that's that's god the devil his prophets his apostles versus evil men good versus darkness the the the light sword he said that's the bible that was his testimony the man who invented it and he didn't he wasn't even shy to to say it i read it i read his interview and so so we we realized that that that when we when we think about pressing toward the mark i mean i want to go in a rapture so that means i have to go forward i don't want to miss the rapture so that means i shouldn't stay back and idle i've got to constantly be moving forward it compels progress it compels forward movement and a willingness to go high in the spirit and a willingness to go higher and when you get higher you have to have a willingness to go higher amen and when you get higher and higher you have to contain a willingness that wants to go higher higher and higher than higher yeah all right and so we realized then that there has to be always this forging ahead and the only way you go higher is it's to go forge into a forge a deeper relationship with christ in his word because physically high is not what we're talking about you you could you could get in elon musk rocket ship and escape earth's gravitational pull that wouldn't put you in heaven amen it wouldn't put you in heavenly places in christ jesus so we're we're talking about a spiritual thing so to go higher spiritually you have to go deeper into the spirit all right my burden first so this forward motion this constant moving deeper into christ which then elevates you higher it elevates you higher in wisdom who don't want it anybody don't want that anybody don't want wisdom it elevates you in power who don't want that right amen it elevates you in the treasures of heaven who don't want that raise your hand please we're gonna pray for you so going deeper and and i use the word forging because you have to forget you have to press paul said it means to strain it means to you know if there's something beyond your natural limit and you have to stretch for it amen amen if you're not good at if you're not if you don't stretch a lot you'll catch a cramp doing that and i've seen people catch spiritual cramps and lock up trying to stretch forward into spiritual things you see because this is a lifestyle friends this is a this is an everyday relationship that you have to work on every day of your life you should always be making progress you should always be going forward you should always be improving amen this is what god has for you don't never settle for mediocrity and bear in mind that excellence becomes mediocrity later on if you don't keep pressing you see what i mean you say well i i tell you i got all these testimonies where i used to pray this many times a day and read my bible when i've read it this many times okay fine what are you doing today see because now if you're not if you haven't continued that on then then and why why do we do that why do we get these times where we we we we languish in lethargy and suddenly we come to church and somebody starts singing a song and we just start tapping our finger that's pretty good next thing you know you don't even know your toes tapping next thing you know you're clapping your hands you're starting to feel what's happening the holy spirit worship in song and starting to drive away spirits and then a preacher comes out and you're ripe and ready and the word comes and it starts washing you and you're like wow world what have i been doing oh my goodness praise the lord i want to go forward and you run out of here like like a mighty man of valor and and and the next day you're still a mighty man of valor and the next day you're still a mighty man of valor the next day what was i doing uh what mighty whatever what was i and then and then the next thing you know here goes two weeks three weeks where'd that mighty man of valor go and then you come back to another service and the lord starts you all over again that's that's crazy to live like that amen no wonder you don't have the wisdom you need and the power you need in the word of god because it's filled with wisdom and power see and so satan of course busy i get it he's always distracting us and filling us up with stuff of the world and and getting us off of the path and you know it requires forward motion it requires change you have to be willing to change i one of my one of my uh at the very top of my doctor's bag i have a medicine in it when when i get married couples coming to see me i haven't had one a long time so don't think i'm talking about you but who who said and i can see that they're just at odds with each other and i'm trying to get to the bottom of it and you know here she's sitting with her arms crossed and he's looking out the window and and i'm trying to say okay you know well what's what's wrong here and you know and right away you know one of them sure enough sure shoot and one of them will say the magic word i'm just waiting to hear it he's changed she's changed too he's not the man i'm married yeah that's right i'll tell you when i married her is this this and this and she's changed brother jason i'm i'm sitting there like praise the lord like what i said change is the most fundamental progress is the most fundamental part of a marriage relationship it means you're evolving well okay sister so you married him he was 21 and probably still kind of had some boy ways in him and now he's 28 you still want him to act like he's 21 no well then you'd appreciate his changing right yeah i guess i would excuse me sir when you married her she could barely scorch water but now she's become a a chef do you want her to go back no so you glad she changed oh yeah i'm glad she changed so change is necessary change and nobody likes that people don't like change people like comfort okay i've got my life i've got my comfort zone i'm this i'm that don't change nothing i like it just the way it is i give you my word god will wreck it and change you because you say why will he do it because you're not raptured yet and he's not trying to make you comfortable here he's trying to make you comfortable there you understand so we'll rest in the millennium but right here it requires that we press it requires that we be willing to change it requires that we be willing to advance fact is if you're not you become stagnant and and you know the the the the river of life is not a stagnant pond amen now i i fully get that still water uh is a bible he leadeth me beside the still water but that's deep water that's an artesian well doing that that and i've been to artisan wells i've been to the artesian spring brother branham talked about bubbling and don't always bubble sometimes it rolls sometimes it's very still it just depends on the rain and what's pushing from under underground but no matter when the time i went and it was quite still but i could still see it was moving and it was feeding out through the farmer's field and going down to who knows where and you couldn't plug it up you tried it blow up somewhere else because so so and i mean i i granted nature finds a way there's life form in a stagnant pond but that's not for you you're a seven colored rainbow trout the stagnant pond's not you there might be life in there nature people find a way to exist and live how they go by and face day to day i don't know but that's not the bride your breath your life is to be vibrant and moving and and and warm and lush and healthy and vigorous you're to be producing you're to be accomplishing you're to be moving and progressing see and that requires change people don't like that heraclitus said i believe that all things pass and nothing stays and comparing existing things to the flow of a river he says you should not step twice into the same river that plato said that you should never be able to step twice in the in a river in the same place in the river because why it's moving it's always moving no matter where you set your foot you're going to step in water but pull it out and step it back in you got new water because that water you previously stepped in has already gone downstream you said i mean so so one constant since the beginning of time might be change and a lot of times that's not as bad as the fear of change and people oftentimes are very much afraid of of change you know the fear of change is also a constant i just want to say that to you it's also a constant you know since since since the beginning of time since genesis we find that humans tend to like routine because it makes us feel comfortable in our lives you know i remember brother don had to get up here uh many years ago and had to make an announcement as a deacon from this pulpit to say listen y'all this ain't yankee stadium you don't have reserve seating you know if somebody sits in your seat it's not your seat if you want it get here earlier beat him out of the parking lot if you see him pull in run amen the only seat everybody knows not to get a sister debbie's seat and sister jean i sister jean she's she her problem is she's so short and she can't see her anybody so she kept moving around different places she said i finally found me the place to sit and she said and then guess who sat in front of me come in and sit right down in front of me i said who she said gideon i said i promise you you'll never see around that boy you better stand up if you want to see over him you can't even see around him and and so so she's she's moving and i finally said i said mom do you want to sit on the platform it'll be okay the church will allow it come on mom i'll you can sit up here beside with beside me and uh and we'll give you a special place but you know um we like routine and when the fear of change becomes they they actually have a and i don't know that i can pronounce this meta uh metathesiophobia it's actually um the persistent abnormal and unwarranted fear of change it becomes doesn't start out all the time but it can become a phobia see and literally you know people uh they they tend to live in the past and are unwilling to progress which often leads to depression often ruins careers whole careers have been lost by people unwilling you know uh it can seriously impact your lives both personally and professionally you know if a society or a or or a country rejects change then there's no growth if a church rejects change now i'm not talking about changing the word of god but what i am saying to you is that if we believe the word of god we're moving forward amen always upward and onward that's my point to you so don't let your life become stagnant just because you it's more comfortable to sit back it's more comfortable to sit back it's hey it's more comfortable to sit at home and stream a service and it's very easy to hide behind the to hide behind a pandemic i i people that do that don't have any problem going to grocery stores restaurants you know whatever yeah but yeah and and i sister debbie and i were talking about this the other day and she was watching one of her cooking shows and the ladies a good baptist lady and she was talking about i think her husband's a pastor and and he got oh he got on there talking about how same thing i mean you think these things where i can get prayed for somewhere where demons are a little afraid to come into you know because the power of god might expose them they don't like being exposed and so so we we have to we can't allow our lives to become stagnant i mean if you think about if you think about job's life job went to church every day i'm sorry uh enoch enoch went to church every day that pyramid was his church the great pyramid now listen friends that's not a virtual pyramid amen he didn't build that thing at home watching it online he had to go build it you follow me so that's not a virtual pyramid that thing's real you can go up brother michael's seen it you you can actually go there and so so so so we realized that that we've got to be you know up and moving up and at it jesus said pray you're the lord of the harvest that he'll send forth laborers and people don't want to be sent forth and they don't want to labor and god wants you to do both see so we've got to always be willing to go forward when you're finished changing said benjamin franklin once when you are finished changing you are finished so brother branham makes this statement into whom would we go he said you tell me somewhere or someplace that you could go or something you could do or something you could achieve that would be everlasting outside of jesus christ tell me if you could build a house that would be everlasting tell me if you could build a popularity be eternal tell me you could get enough riches that be eternal riches you cannot do it nothing outside of jesus christ he is the eternal achievement what a term jesus is the eternal achievement and if you have achieved ever so much in your life you have never achieved the eternal thing yet until you have found christ jesus and have got him in your heart he is the eternal achievement amen amen i i caught a headline just yesterday the day before and there was some father in a courtroom and they've got the man and he's he's being arraigned and he's he went into a movie theater just recently just this week and hear his 18 year old daughter on her first date and she's dating some one of these tick tock stars guys like uber famous and you know you you can see him on tik tok youtube and all those kind of places and he's he travels i don't really know i've never seen his thing i only saw his picture and read a little bit about him and i didn't forget what his name was but you know him and her met she became a fan of his show and they met and he come did everything proper met the family took the girl she's going on our first date at 18 years old and uh and they they're just gonna go out here and they're gonna take in a movie and they don't know that they're never coming home and some crazy guy just walks up and guns them both down somebody they don't know somebody without a grudge and and the father's screaming at this man in the courtroom look at me look at me when i'm talking to you this was my baby this was my only girl my first child why'd you kill her so here we have you don't know friends you think your life is ever so secure but i'm here to tell you there's only one eternal achievement you think that young man i make no i have no know nothing of him but do you think that all of his popularity is of any value to him now do you think that young girl has any value in her popularity she looked like a very popular it's quite worldly you know uh makeup and all that kind of stuff i'm not speaking against her i don't know her don't know her heart but my point is that no matter what you could ever do tell me you could build popularity that would be eternal tell me you could get enough riches that be eternal riches you cannot do it nothing outside of jesus christ he is the eternal achievement that's what i want in my life friends i want the eternal achievement i'm not interested in something temporary why would you chase that tell me you could build a bank account that would last you forever tell me you could build a house buy a car buy a boat tell me you could have friends tell me you could have health or youth that could last you eternally you can't it's beyond your reach i'm here to tell you stop reaching for that and start reaching for something higher start being ready to move forward in christ we're almost out of here we're almost home time this is no time to be languishing back in laodicea yeah get up in adelaide to see it press hard press high we're challenged this hour i i understand humans since them and more time immemorial don't like progress they don't like change humans like comfort of familiarity don't change anything please but you become stagnant doing that you become stagnant i don't have time to get to the rest of my sermon but i just want to i just want to put that in your heart today so firmly before i close that god is on the move amen he's on the move friends young people he's on the move we realized friend you talking about change and i wanted to go in today to deal with some of the things around the sixth seal and i wanted to go down and read some parallel verses i'll get to it next time for sure i'll definitely get to it because it's exciting amen but change is coming the world you're in is changing every day amen you think god's not i don't mean changing in his nature he doesn't change in his characteristics that's the beauty that that ought to overcome all your fears to progress because he's the same yesterday and forever and so really when you think about it that way i can say to you you're not at risk to give up your comfortable mediocrity you're only at risk trying to stay in your level of mediocrity because if you stay there that's not an eagle you understand and since you are an eagle but you're not acting like an eagle then yeah god will bring the loving his tender hand of correction on your life it won't have nothing to do with curses or plagues or anything like that or judgment it's just god child training so so so you know sometimes in our lives we just we just have to embrace it because you can't stop change amen the world is changing they would love they they they talk fondly uh brother josh turned me on to a wonderful historical podcast wow brother josh wherever you are i'm loving that and and and and this man is just going back you know through history and one of the things that he's dealt with looking back into world war ii and the the players during that epic uh saga of human history is they're they're always you know always longing to get back to the good old days he said which generally didn't really exist amen that we we gloss it over we have a fondness all the good old days there's never been any good old days a man i don't care what year it say no but i remember man you know in the 50s and and there was such pro but listen i don't care what age you put it in man born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble that's always going to be true stop chasing this life because man that's born of a woman and i'm sure you didn't get here if you weren't man that's born of a woman is just a few days and full of trouble and the world really is falling apart it's not just in your mind it's not it's not fake news the world is falling apart and the players who are in control over the world are trying to break it they're trying to destroy it because it's a power grab that's not conspiracy that's prophecy that's right off the tape brother branham said that he said the money we're giving away to all these other nations brother madam said giving away money we don't have and can't collect taxes on it for multiple generations he said they the establishment presumably they are trying to break it why because the false prophet rules through commerce and craft and business and money see i mean that's coming friends let me and you think you think they've passed laws now and it doesn't even matter you can win court cases here's a man and woman i forget what it was they do i think wedding cakes and they didn't want to make a wedding cake for a gay couple because it violated their protestant beliefs and they the city shut them down the lower courts ruled against them the medium courts ruled against them the federal courts ruled against them the the appellate courts ruled against them and only when it finally got to a mostly conservative supreme court they finally won you think that you think that stop the devil not at all then the next time here's another man and woman take a stand on their religious beliefs and they won't have anything to do with the homosexual union and right away here goes the city shutting them down here goes the same courts same lower courts medium courts higher court state courts federal courts appellate courts and it goes all the way to supreme court again took years these people spent millions of dollars all to hear the supreme court go no you're okay you say okay now surely they'll never try that again it's already in the news already in the news here's a man and woman with a farm and they they do weddings at their farm because it's beautiful and they're they're catholic and and that might save them because they're catholic because it's hard for them to fight against them being being catholic and they the city shutting them down you can't sell your stuff at farmers markets anymore because you won't do a gay wedding they said well it's against god's word it's against our truly held religious beliefs no your business we're a farm we're private farm yeah but you're not going to come in here and lansing and do business with us we the mayor gets on there and said if you want to be a bigot we don't want you so i believe this makes me a bigot i want to say to the world to you to the internet believing this doesn't make you a bigot it makes you a believer it makes you a godly christian person and i don't care what the world in their nasty ways wants to call normal if this doesn't call it normal i'm going to say it's not normal and i don't care what they think and we don't i don't need their support because i you say well how will you live i know that wherever the carcass is eagles are gathered hallelujah they'll come from the east and west they'll come from the lands of far to eat at his feast to dine as his guest how blessed these pilgrims are oh you're blessed today friends don't so so be be prepared because i'm here to tell you if you're afraid of change let me warn you that catastrophic change is rushing to meet us and the only path for the believer is up amen and sometimes we need to find ourselves a little more inclined to up stand sometimes maybe you're here today and maybe my sermon has touched your heart and you realize that these that evil forces and antichrist spirits and judgments the bible called there's never been a day like it before and there will never be a day like it again and i'm here to tell you friends those judgments are rushing to meet us you think they've they've they that the world is in a sickened condition sickness is rushing to meet us i told you back last year in the first part of the year when everybody was starting to fear them the emergence of covet 19 and i said listen friends there will be five more behind that and there'll be ten more behind those five it's not going to stop the world is transitioning it's not ending world's not ending the world is transitioning and christ it's going to have a king come down and set up a millennial government and the bride of jesus christ will be the administrators of god's righteousness and there will be peace in this earth for a thousand years oh i want to go forward i want to go upward be prepared because the only path for the believer is up and that's my last line and the last line i wrote in my notes sometimes we need to find ourselves more inclined to up and i sit and stare at that line and i and i said you too boy i need to be more inclined to up how many want to be more inclined to up satan will never let you have that kind of trajectory he'll just want you to be like this because he knows that because time is moving and because prophecy is moving then you're on a moving treadmill and nothing's standing still not prophecy it's not standing still you ever stood still on a moving treadmill it doesn't end well you so if you stop if you get comfortable and you stop in your spiritual uh moisture your spiritual relationship your spiritual strength your daily spiritual diet your spiritual prayer life and you you fill all that up with stuff jobs education entertainments recreation and all you have is stuff you're going to find yourself backsliding you're going to find yourself cold and powerless i didn't say you're not going to be a son or daughter of god i said you're going to be an underachieving low expectation believer and you're never going to and that's hey that's one thing if you're a young teenager and you got people taking care of you but if you're a father or a husband if you're a wife or a mom and you got people responsible let me tell you something brothers sisters we need to be inclined to up you want to make that commitment to god to say today lord i want to i want to re i want to recalibrate i need to respawn i need to restart i want to i want to have my mind to go away wait a minute there is catastrophic change rushing to meet me i my only path is up i want to go up lord i want to go up in all aspects of my life let me pray for you before we close and we have brother matt sing bow your heads with me oh i can hear it brother matt's going to sing that song again i'd keep your heads bowed i i i couldn't sing it because i probably can't do it again because i can't get through it i fall pieces over this song and i had to stand there as he was singing thinking oh man how am i going to walk to that pulpit i'm going to fall apart so lord thank you as paul said first i thank my god i stand here today lord and you know the struggle that i had through all this week lord what is it you've given me this explosion of thought and then you seem to have fallen silent and i've set before you and i've played tapes and i've read my bible and i've thought lord from here and i i see now your great wisdom in it you were just waiting i don't think you wanted me to overthink it so you bring me out today and you inspired me lord from from the word go from the moment i opened my mouth i felt your inspiration and i can see the effect it's had on the people listening and i am completely positive there are those listening online today father who who have who have realized that progress is necessary that catastrophic change is rushing to meet us and the only path for the bride is up so help us to go up help me to be inclined to up granted lord let my daily goals and plans and everything i plan in the midst of my business in the midst of education in the midst of the marketplace in the midst of vacation and recreation in the midst of all of that may i be more inclined to up granite lord and that that only is achieved by going deeper by deepening forging a deeper relationship with you i pray you grant it i commit this audience into your hands today everyone who's heard my voice lord hands went up everywhere and i'm i know you saw the need under that hand i know you saw the honest hearts that's that's wonderful about church when people can come into your presence it makes them real honest the gospel the preaching the singing the worship it starts loosening the grip of the enemy and the preaching finishes the job and drives back spirits of unbelief now work on what you have sown in their hearts where would i be singing [Music] glad you see [Music] if not if not for grace where would i be you only know [Music] i'm glad you see through i am so glad for that [Music] amazing amazing grace

hand of jesus touched me [Music] and now i am no longer the same [Music] he touched me [Music] something really happened and now i know he touched me that he made [Music] and since i met [Music] this
