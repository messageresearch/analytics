[25:37] Bible, we'll go straight to the word
[25:39] tonight. Happy, so happy to be here in
[25:41] the house.
[25:43] Thank you for all that
[25:46] worship. We had a little struggle there
[25:48] uh in the back that was unseen with the
[25:50] sound. He wasn't getting anything
[25:51] online. So, I had to spend a little bit
[25:53] of time. I'm sorry, brother Ken, if you
[25:55] called me. I'm not sure if you did or
[25:56] not. I was uh just rushing to get out
[25:59] here, but uh I know that the devil
[26:01] didn't win, and he's not a winner. He's
[26:02] a loser. He loses every time. Amen. He
[26:05] tries to attack the family of God. So,
[26:07] we got the victory. Amen. We can hear
[26:09] and hear, and they can hear online. So,
[26:11] praise the Lord to
[26:13] Daniel chapter 3. We just want to begin
[26:15] reading here. And I'm just going to take
[26:16] a sermon title tonight. Just a um
[26:19] direction that we'll go tonight. We'll
[26:21] pick up from where we were Sunday. Lord
[26:23] willing, unless the Lord changes our
[26:24] direction, we'll go that way again on
[26:26] Sunday morning.
[26:28] You love the Lord.
[26:30] Amen.
[26:31] Daniel chapter 3. I'm just going to
[26:34] title this taking a stand.
[26:37] Daniel chapter 3. Let's just begin
[26:39] reading verse.
[26:54] to the wireless brother.
[27:03] Praise the Lord. What does our pastor
[27:06] say? The devil ain't nothing. He ain't
[27:08] nobody. That's what he says. He ain't
[27:10] nobody. He ain't nobody. Boo devil.
[27:13] Amen. Praise the Lord. You love the
[27:15] Lord.
[27:16] Amen. We're in worship tonight. enter
[27:18] right in spirit and in truth. Say,
[27:19] "Lord, give me my portion what you have
[27:21] for me." Amen. How many can say that?
[27:24] Just just cut all distractions out and
[27:26] say, "Lord, just for this moment, in
[27:28] this just little bit of time that we
[27:29] have, let's hear from heaven." That's
[27:32] our desire. I believe the Lord has
[27:34] something to speak to us. Daniel chapter
[27:35] 3, let's begin again. Hope that's
[27:37] better. Brother Travis in the back.
[27:39] Thou, oh king, verse 10, hast made a
[27:42] decree that every man that shall hear
[27:45] the sound of the cornet, flute, the
[27:48] hearty harp, he names all these
[27:49] instruments. And at the end, he says,
[27:50] shall fall down and worship the golden
[27:53] image. And who so fallth not down and
[27:57] worshipeth that he should be cast in the
[28:01] midst of a burning fiery furnace? There
[28:04] are certain Jews whom thou has set over
[28:06] the affairs of the province of Babylon,
[28:09] Shadrach, Mach, and Abedneo. These men,
[28:12] O king, have not regarded thee. They
[28:16] serve not thy gods, nor worship the
[28:19] golden image which thou hast set up."
[28:22] Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[28:25] commanded to bring Shadrach, Mach, and
[28:28] Abedneo. Then they brought these men
[28:31] before the king. Nebuchadnezzar spoke
[28:34] and said unto them, "Is it true, oh
[28:37] Shadrach, Mach, and Abedneo?" In other
[28:40] words, really, guys, really? Like, is
[28:43] this real? Are you really going to do
[28:45] this after everybody in the entire world
[28:47] and the whole culture and the whole
[28:49] system and everybody's fallen in line?
[28:52] You mean you're going to be an oddball
[28:53] and step out of line? Oh, yeah. That's
[28:55] what God's children always do. They
[28:57] never go with the flow. They go against
[28:59] the flow. And any true believer who's
[29:01] really has a conviction of the from the
[29:03] Lord in his heart will ne will always
[29:06] take a stand. No matter what pressure is
[29:08] around him, he'll take a stand for the
[29:11] word of God. Can you say amen tonight?
[29:14] Notice he says, "Is it true?" Verse 14,
[29:17] "Is it true, oh Shadrach, Meshach, and
[29:20] Abedneo, do you not serve my gods, nor
[29:23] worship the golden image which I have
[29:25] set up? Now if you be ready that at what
[29:29] time you hear the sound of the cornet,
[29:31] the flute, the heart, sackbud, the
[29:33] sultry, the doulamer, and all kinds of
[29:35] music, you fall down and worship the
[29:38] image which I have made. Well, but if
[29:41] you worship not, you shall be cast the
[29:44] same hour into the midst of a burning
[29:46] fiery furnace. And who is that God that
[29:50] shall deliver you out of my hands?"
[29:53] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo answered
[29:55] and said to the king, "Oh
[29:57] Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to
[29:59] answer thee in this matter." In other
[30:02] words, talk to the hand, devil, cuz you
[30:06] ain't getting my attention. In fact, I'm
[30:08] not even going to take anything your
[30:10] threats and your your your all of your
[30:13] big boisterous words. I'm not even going
[30:15] to consider them. I serve a God and I
[30:18] answer to God and God alone. Hallelujah.
[30:21] He says verse 16, Shadrach, Meshach, and
[30:24] Abednego said to the king, "Oh
[30:25] Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to
[30:27] answer thee in this matter." If it be
[30:30] so, our God whom we serve is able to
[30:34] deliver us from the burning fiery
[30:36] furnace. How many have that kind of
[30:37] faith tonight to say, "No matter what I
[30:40] face in my life, my God is able."
[30:45] Lord Jesus, we just bow our heads
[30:47] tonight. So thankful Lord for your grace
[30:50] Lord that's even brought us here and set
[30:52] us set us in this building Lord. How
[30:55] many other places Lord we could be
[30:57] Father tonight. How many Lord other if
[31:01] the devil would have had his way in many
[31:03] of our lives here tonight Lord we
[31:04] wouldn't even be in a church God but
[31:07] because of grace grace. grace, marvelous
[31:11] grace, Lord. We not only find oursel
[31:14] here in a building gathered with people,
[31:16] Lord, and hearing your word. That's a
[31:18] wonderful benefit, Lord. But we sit here
[31:21] with a hunger and a thirst for more of
[31:24] you tonight. I pray, God, that you would
[31:27] come by your spirit. Let me just move
[31:29] myself out of the way. I know that Satan
[31:32] has tried to hinder this service, and
[31:33] he's always trying to hinder the word of
[31:36] God. He's not He doesn't hate me, Lord.
[31:38] hates the word that's inside of me,
[31:40] Lord. And I pray, God, that right now
[31:42] you would bind him, bind every spirit,
[31:44] Lord God, of hindrance that would try to
[31:46] prevent, Lord, the word from falling
[31:49] upon the hearts of your believers. I
[31:51] pray God that you would curse the enemy
[31:53] right now, Lord. And may father we just
[31:55] join our faith together, our licks of
[31:57] fire as we raise our hands Lord as a
[32:00] body of believers and we say God we
[32:02] surrender ourself, we surrender our
[32:04] mind. We surrender our thoughts. We
[32:07] focus now on your word for Lord it's
[32:10] your word that we want to receive. May
[32:12] you do it now Lord I pray father to each
[32:14] one in Jesus Christ's name. And the
[32:16] church said
[32:18] amen. You can be seated.
[32:21] Let's pick it up here and uh in verse uh
[32:25] 15 again. We'll just begin. We'll just
[32:27] read it just uh as you as you take your
[32:29] seats. Keep your Bible open there if you
[32:31] could. Now, if you be ready, at what
[32:33] time you hear the sound of the cornet,
[32:36] the flute. Now, this was amazing because
[32:39] all of these men were not named the name
[32:42] that Nebuchadnezzar had named them. In
[32:44] fact, that wasn't their identity. But
[32:46] one of the first things the devil will
[32:48] always try to do to sons and daughters
[32:51] of God is change their identity so that
[32:54] they're known by a different name. Now,
[32:57] your name is important and who God, as
[33:00] the song says, I've got a new name. You
[33:02] don't have a new name. When you came to
[33:04] an altar and gave your heart to the
[33:05] Lord, you've got a name that was already
[33:07] written before the foundation of the
[33:09] world. And your life's journey is
[33:11] recognizing that name and bringing your
[33:14] body subject to what the word of God
[33:17] calls you.
[33:20] Well, we're going to take our jacket off
[33:22] tonight cuz I could tell we're fighting
[33:24] the devil. And we're going to keep
[33:25] fighting and I'm going to roll my
[33:26] sleeves up and I'm going to keep
[33:27] preaching. You know why? Because the
[33:29] truth sets people free. And I want to
[33:31] preach the truth tonight. Satan will
[33:33] always try to rename you as he does to
[33:35] Shadrach, Meshack, and Abedneo. This
[33:38] wasn't their original Hebrew names. This
[33:40] was their Babylonian names. In fact,
[33:42] their Hebrew names were Mishiel,
[33:45] Hananiah, and Azeriah. But yet, you find
[33:48] here in the scripture, Satan has now
[33:50] changed their name or tried to change
[33:53] their identity. Remember, we preached
[33:55] this on Sunday that if we're not
[33:57] careful, we lose our identity of what
[33:59] the word says and we start confessing
[34:02] what the world says. And the world has a
[34:04] system and the world has a flow that
[34:06] it's trying to go. culture and politics,
[34:09] education. If you haven't recognized
[34:11] that, just look at the education system
[34:13] today. Everyone is falling under the
[34:16] music or the symphony or the rhythm of
[34:19] what the devil is preaching. The entire
[34:22] world economy, governments, politics,
[34:25] music, entertainment, Hollywood,
[34:27] education, every world system today is
[34:31] following a world order that is the
[34:34] maestro is not the Lord Jesus. It's
[34:36] Satan himself. Even brother Barryham
[34:39] said even the churches today, remember
[34:41] we read it on Sunday and he said, "This
[34:43] will get me shot one day that the
[34:45] churches are being bewitched. They're
[34:47] falling under the sound of a music to
[34:50] where it harmonizes and synchronizes
[34:53] everybody's mind in one spirit and one
[34:56] accord." And they finally fall under one
[34:58] spirit and one one accord and they
[35:00] worship the beast. But let me just
[35:01] preach here tonight. There's another
[35:03] music that I'm hearing in my heart.
[35:05] There's another rhythm that I want my
[35:07] life to line up to. And it's not the
[35:09] devil's music or his rhythm or his time,
[35:12] but I believe the bride is hearing the
[35:14] music from heaven and she's saying,
[35:16] "Lord, line my life and synchronize my
[35:19] life with the rhythm coming from
[35:21] heaven."
[35:23] He always tries to get us to change our
[35:25] identity. Brother Brandham says, "God,"
[35:27] he says, "This has always been the
[35:29] battle. This has always been the
[35:31] struggle. is is man being able to
[35:34] recognize what the word said about them.
[35:36] Not about somebody else, not about your
[35:38] brother, your sister, but when the word
[35:40] of God tells you, you're an overcomer,
[35:42] you're not a loser, you're a winner,
[35:44] you're not a loser, you you're going to
[35:46] make it, you're not going to lose,
[35:49] we've got to confess what the word of
[35:50] God said about us. And don't confess
[35:53] anything else. You say, "Well, my body
[35:55] tells me something different. My mind
[35:57] tells me something different." Well,
[35:59] make your body obey your confession. And
[36:01] your confession is confessing what the
[36:03] word says.
[36:04] And brother Brandon says, "The Holy
[36:06] Ghost in you makes your body come
[36:08] subject to the word of God." So I ask
[36:10] you, what are we confessing? What are we
[36:12] preaching to ourselves?
[36:14] Amen.
[36:15] What are we confessing when with our
[36:16] lives?
[36:17] Praise God. So he says here, notice this
[36:20] here if you keep reading there in verse
[36:21] 16, Shadrach, Meshach answered and said
[36:24] to the old said to the king, oh
[36:26] Nebuchadnezzar. So this battle even
[36:28] starts long before this moment that you
[36:30] read this in Daniel chapter 3. The
[36:32] battle had already started with Daniel
[36:34] when he's uh renamed uh uh when he's
[36:37] when he's name given this name Beltazar.
[36:40] You notice one of the very first things
[36:41] and I think this is in chapter 1. Uh it
[36:44] it speaks about how that all of Israel
[36:46] was deported into Babylon and and their
[36:49] their their their selection that they
[36:51] bring is men like Daniel. And so Daniel
[36:54] as well as all three of these men,
[36:56] Azeriah, Mishiel, and and Haniah and and
[36:59] their their their names are are are are
[37:02] Daniel and Azeriah, Mishel, Haniah. But
[37:05] Nebuchadnezzar renames them. Why?
[37:07] Because their name gave them their
[37:09] identity. It's who they were. It was
[37:11] their roots. It's where they came from.
[37:13] It's what lineage they came from. And
[37:16] and so he renames them. He renames them
[37:19] Shadrach and Mach and Abedneo. Now, if
[37:22] you look up these Babylonian names, it's
[37:24] actually names. Mishiel's name means the
[37:27] moon god or god of the moon, son of the
[37:29] moon. That's not who Michel was. That's
[37:32] not who his identity was. That's not
[37:35] what the word called him, but that's
[37:37] what the devil tried to rename him to.
[37:40] This was Haniah. His name meant Jehovah.
[37:42] uh Jehovah I I think it was Jehovah
[37:44] conquers or Jehovah saves him. I could
[37:46] get that sand correction there. But his
[37:48] original name that God gave him was
[37:51] going to be important to him because it
[37:53] spoke of his history. It spoke of who he
[37:56] was. And so what's the first thing the
[37:58] devil tries to do is he renames all of
[38:00] these men and gives them Babylonian
[38:03] names. And so now we find ourselves in
[38:06] chapter 1 and they're they're being told
[38:08] that they've got to eat the king's meat
[38:10] and they've got to drink the king's
[38:12] wine. In other words, if you're going to
[38:14] live here, you got to be like us. This
[38:15] is the pressure we're going to put you
[38:17] under. If you're going to live in the
[38:18] world, you got to be like the world.
[38:20] Well, that's a lie of the devil. Just
[38:22] because you live in the world don't mean
[38:24] you have to be of the world. I'll go
[38:26] further and say, just cuz you go to a
[38:27] worldly school don't mean you got to
[38:29] look like the worldly kids. Just because
[38:31] you're the only one believing in your
[38:33] family doesn't mean you got to bow down
[38:35] under pressure and tolerate a demon
[38:38] spirit. I say today, as my title says,
[38:40] take a stand for the word of God. Take a
[38:43] stand for the power of God. Take a stand
[38:45] for what you believe. We live in an age
[38:48] of complete tolerance. Very much like
[38:51] Nebuchadnezzar's Babylon was, an age of
[38:54] pressure, a society to just fall in
[38:57] line. Just fall in order. Just get
[39:00] behind. Don't be an oddball. Don't try
[39:02] to stick out. No, you don't need to be
[39:04] so different. You know, everybody,
[39:06] everybody's just the same. Come on. You
[39:08] don't have to be You don't have to be so
[39:10] odd. You don't have to be so different.
[39:12] And friends, if we're not careful, this
[39:14] is exactly where our world is heading.
[39:17] To where everything is so offensive to
[39:19] everybody and feelings are are so put on
[39:22] a pedestal to where you got to be
[39:23] careful what you say. You got to be
[39:25] careful how you say it. You got to be
[39:27] careful the kind of words that you use.
[39:29] It's It's infiltrating No, it's
[39:31] infiltrating our schools. It's
[39:33] infiltrating our workplace. Trust me,
[39:35] I'm speaking by experience here. I know.
[39:37] To where you got to be told you got to
[39:39] use the right pronouns. You got to say
[39:40] the right names. You You can't call
[39:42] somebody something that might hurt their
[39:44] feelings or offend them. This is the
[39:46] pressure in the society that Satan's
[39:49] Eden would come to a climax or a
[39:51] crescendo in this age. Amen.
[39:55] And this is the exact age, an age of
[39:57] toleration where we're told we've got to
[39:59] tolerate things. John Wesley says
[40:01] something very popular, very familiar
[40:03] quote. I know that you know very well in
[40:04] the first slide there. Uh if you just
[40:07] want to put that up, you can keep my
[40:08] PowerPoint up. This is powerful
[40:10] statement. And John Wesley says, "What
[40:12] one generation tolerates, the next
[40:15] generation will embrace.
[40:18] What one generation tolerates
[40:21] the next generation will embrace. This
[40:25] is this is precisely what this pressure
[40:29] was coming from from Daniel. And it was
[40:32] this redefining or renaming and they
[40:35] they would try to move the ancient
[40:37] landmarks and try to move the historical
[40:40] boundaries. This is the the very assault
[40:42] of Hollywood. It's it's its modus
[40:44] operandi. That's exactly what it's
[40:46] boldly taken a stand to say. We don't
[40:50] care about your values. We don't care
[40:52] about your traditions. We don't care
[40:54] about what you think. We're going to
[40:56] have a bold agenda and you better line
[40:58] up or we'll cancel you.
[41:03] And so there's this pressure even in
[41:05] this age we live in. Uh e even even in
[41:09] in masculinity. This is something I'm
[41:11] just going to take a little just a side
[41:14] a detour here just for a moment. But
[41:16] even even in in in the in the word of
[41:19] masculinity, it's a pretty powerful
[41:21] thing when you study the Bible and and
[41:23] there's so many. I'm just pulling up my
[41:25] references here that I that I had
[41:27] written down. Notice some of these some
[41:30] of these uh uh scriptures here in 1
[41:34] Corinthians 16. Notice the language of
[41:36] the Bible about masculinity. Notice this
[41:39] here. He says in 1 Corinthians 16:13,
[41:43] and this is from the NAS, you can put it
[41:44] on the King James and we could follow
[41:46] along. That's just fine. He says, "Be on
[41:48] alert and stand firm in the faith.
[41:54] Act like men,
[41:56] be strong."
[41:58] Now, that's first Corinthians 16:13. And
[42:01] your King James would word it like this.
[42:02] Quit you like men, be strong. So, what
[42:07] was Paul's uh uh what was Paul's
[42:11] interpretation of a man? That a man is
[42:13] strong. He's not weak. He's not a wimp.
[42:16] He's not a weakling. Christ Jesus wasn't
[42:18] a weakling.
[42:20] There's a very different thing in your
[42:22] nature when you're gentle and and Jesus
[42:25] was gentle. He he had a spirit of a
[42:27] character of a man that was meek and
[42:29] lowly. But I promise you, he wasn't a
[42:31] weakling. He wasn't a wimp. And he
[42:33] wasn't a pushover. especially to demons
[42:35] and devils and denominational spirits
[42:37] and phariseical spirits. Jesus never
[42:40] backed down to a phariseical demon.
[42:43] But he always spoke what the He always
[42:45] spoke the word and gave it the word. But
[42:48] this is the words of the Bible. Be
[42:49] strong. Quit yourself like a man. This
[42:53] is Ephesians 6. Very familiar. Verse 10.
[42:56] Brethren, be strong, brethren. This was
[43:00] addressed to the men, not the women.
[43:02] There's very good scriptures pertaining
[43:04] to a woman. There's also scriptures that
[43:06] are pertaining to men. And God's
[43:09] identity of a man is found in his word.
[43:12] Not in culture, not in systems of man,
[43:14] not in education. But the word has
[43:17] defined the boundaries of gender of what
[43:19] a man is, of the character of the man,
[43:22] of the nature of the man, of the
[43:24] position of the man, the place of the
[43:26] man, the role of the man in the family.
[43:29] Amen.
[43:30] We have very clear outlined principles
[43:34] of what a man is. And I'm afraid we're
[43:36] living in an age where we've lost the
[43:38] men. We've lost we're we're losing not
[43:41] talking about this church. I'm talking
[43:42] about the world that we live in. We've
[43:44] if we're not careful with the
[43:46] masculinity begins to erode in the place
[43:50] of political correctness.
[43:54] I'll go further and say it affects pull
[43:55] pits.
[43:57] And I got the word of God to back me up
[43:59] on that. Where brother Brenn, I'm going
[44:00] to say, "What's the problem today with
[44:02] children delinquency?" It's not
[44:04] children, it's parent delinquency. And
[44:06] where does parent delinquency come from?
[44:08] Weak pullpits who aren't who are afraid
[44:12] of what the celebrity might think or
[44:14] afraid of what the people might think or
[44:16] afraid of losing congregants or hurting
[44:18] somebody's feeling. I'll just say it
[44:20] again. As as my good friend says,
[44:22] feelings are overrated. Right.
[44:26] Feelings are overrated. We can become so
[44:28] careful
[44:30] to try to say the right thing that we
[44:33] diminish the truth.
[44:36] And the truth is the only thing that'll
[44:38] set people free.
[44:40] Can I get a good hearty amen out of 100%
[44:43] of the church here? The truth is the
[44:46] only thing that will set people free.
[44:48] dancing around feelings and patty caking
[44:51] the word of God and preaching it diluted
[44:53] and filtered because of how you might
[44:55] want to what others might think will
[44:57] never bring freedom to God's family.
[44:59] It's only when the word is preached in
[45:02] the straight unadulterated purest form.
[45:06] And if we're not careful we we we we we
[45:09] we dance around words as we said. But
[45:12] let let me just say this. It's not it's
[45:14] it's it's it's Satan's desire. It's not
[45:17] God's blueprint. It's Satan's method to
[45:20] try to put pressure as from a Jezebel
[45:22] spirit to try to change what the word of
[45:24] God says. Men have always the carnal
[45:27] mind has always tried to reculturize
[45:32] to make things more palpable to uh to to
[45:34] the to the to the world to the carnal
[45:37] mind. They've always tried to dress it
[45:39] up,
[45:40] try to but you know just paint it up and
[45:42] sort of jazz it up
[45:44] that raw form. They don't like it
[45:45] because it doesn't set well with the
[45:47] carnal mind.
[45:48] Notice this here. God is, this is
[45:50] Ephesians, brethren, be strong.
[45:52] Ephesians 6:10, be strong. Be strong in
[45:56] the Lord and in the power of his might.
[45:59] Be strong in the grace. 2 Timothy 2:1,
[46:04] be strong in the grace that is in Christ
[46:07] Jesus. I find these words over and over.
[46:10] My brethren, stand up. Quit yourself
[46:12] like a man. Be strong in the Lord.
[46:16] Don't be a weakling. Don't be a wimp.
[46:19] Don't bow down to the pressure. Take a
[46:21] stand. Be strong in your conviction. I
[46:24] believe more than ever before, we need
[46:25] men of God, young people alike, who will
[46:28] take a stand for what they believe. No
[46:31] matter what it costs them, no matter
[46:33] what it makes them look like, no matter
[46:35] who it what friends leave them or family
[46:37] leaves them, it's time the body of
[46:39] Christ takes a stand for the word of
[46:41] God. Yes.
[46:43] Be strong in the in the grace. This is 1
[46:46] John 2:14. Young men, you are strong and
[46:50] the word of God abideth in you and you
[46:53] have overcome the wicked one.
[46:58] This is the message of the Bible. This
[47:00] is what the Bible speaks about. It's not
[47:02] You don't find wimpy, weak, weakling
[47:05] characters in the Bible. You don't find
[47:07] them in the Old Testament. You don't
[47:08] find them in the New Testament. You find
[47:11] men who are courageous.
[47:14] You know, cou courage is an attribute of
[47:17] God.
[47:19] Courage is an attribute. Men and women
[47:21] both have courage. And I could read you
[47:23] many things in the Bible. Women like
[47:25] Rahab who stood out for courage. And I
[47:27] don't want to give you the wrong ideas
[47:30] or to make you think uh I don't want I
[47:32] don't want to say something wrong and
[47:34] and and lose the effect of what I'm
[47:36] trying to say here. I'm not trying to
[47:37] diminish women. But let me just say this
[47:39] to the men. It's your place if no one
[47:42] else has courage to have courage.
[47:46] It's your place, men, men of God. If if
[47:49] everybody else turns away, it's our
[47:52] place to take a stand.
[47:54] If everybody lose bold and loses
[47:55] boldness, it's the men who's got to
[47:58] remain bold and faithful to the word of
[48:00] God.
[48:03] He says, "Brethren, be strong." This is
[48:06] what the Bible says in Hebrews 11. Even
[48:08] the even the Hebrews of the faith in
[48:10] verse 33, this is what the Bible says
[48:13] about men. They subdued kingdoms.
[48:16] They wrought right who through faith
[48:18] subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
[48:22] obtained promises, stopped the mouths of
[48:25] lions.
[48:28] I don't read weaklings. I don't read
[48:30] wimps. I don't read cowards.
[48:33] I read men. Amen.
[48:36] I read men who were strong in the Lord.
[48:40] They stopped the mouths of lions. Notice
[48:43] this next verse. Verse 34. Quench the
[48:46] violence of fire. Escape the edge of the
[48:49] sword. Out of weakness were made strong.
[48:54] Wax val.
[48:56] Turn to flight the armies of the aliens.
[48:59] This is what men of God did for the
[49:03] kingdom of God. They didn't back down to
[49:06] pressure. Can I get an amen?
[49:08] They didn't back down to pressure. They
[49:10] didn't They didn't back down. No matter
[49:12] how much the world changed, they stuck
[49:14] with the unchanging word.
[49:16] No matter how much pressure was put upon
[49:18] them, they stood in the fiery furnace.
[49:21] They stood in the lion's den. Oh,
[49:23] somebody help me preach here tonight.
[49:25] I'm preaching about a true faith. Faith
[49:27] that takes a stand for the word of God.
[49:29] Faith that is courageous in spite of all
[49:32] kinds of pressure and fear. Amen.
[49:34] Faith that'll that'll take a stand for
[49:36] the word of God. You see this this loss
[49:40] even uh men like this. Even the Apostle
[49:42] Paul speaks of it. We read it in first
[49:44] Corinthians 16. Be watchful. Stand firm
[49:47] in the faith. Act like men. Be strong.
[49:52] Let all that you do be done in love. So
[49:54] you can have love. Do things in love and
[49:57] still be strong as a man. Amen.
[50:00] You notice this this uh what you can
[50:02] read about of as we said we have women
[50:05] in the Bible who were strong. Deborah
[50:07] and Rahab and Esther and who who you can
[50:09] see examples of of great courage. But
[50:13] let me just say there were great there
[50:14] were much a much larger number that you
[50:17] find in the Bible that I think it's on
[50:19] purpose. I think it's God's word meets
[50:22] the challenge of the hour. God's word is
[50:25] not it meets the challenge. No matter
[50:27] how dark the world gets, let me just say
[50:28] this, friends. No matter how dark this
[50:31] world gets and how much they shut out
[50:33] the light, they'll never shut the light
[50:35] of this gospel up. It's the unchanging,
[50:38] infallible, vindicated word. And if you
[50:40] preach the word the way it was written,
[50:42] it'll meet any challenge in your life.
[50:44] Amen.
[50:47] I believe it was written this way on
[50:49] purpose that we have examples of men
[50:51] like Gideon who could be out of weakness
[50:53] could be made strong. We have men like
[50:56] Joshua. We have men like like David,
[50:59] like Jonathan, Nehemiah, even the
[51:01] prophets. These were the even the
[51:03] apostles that Jesus cho chose the 12. Uh
[51:07] we have Jesus himself who who were men
[51:10] of courage who stood
[51:14] no matter what came against them.
[51:16] They weren't cowards. They didn't
[51:18] retreat to the devil. I'm not talking
[51:20] about a I'm not talking about an
[51:22] arrogance or a boisterous or mel
[51:24] chauvinism. I'm talking about real true
[51:26] sons of God made in the image of God. If
[51:29] you're made in the image of God, you've
[51:30] got a conqueror and a warrior down
[51:33] inside of you. You don't have a
[51:35] jellyfish spine. You've got a backbone
[51:37] who will take a stand when the enemy
[51:39] comes against your family. You don't run
[51:41] to the left or to the right. You stand
[51:43] and say, "Devil, I'm not leaving. I'm
[51:45] not a coward. I'm not backing up. I'm
[51:47] going to keep standing for my family,
[51:49] standing for my children, standing for
[51:52] the word of God."
[51:56] And notice these, you can read all the
[51:58] acts throughout the Bible of moments of
[52:01] great extraordinary courage. Men of
[52:04] valor is as Gideon's called man of
[52:07] mighty man of valor. And you you'll
[52:09] notice this is this is what the Bible
[52:11] speaks of when it when even even men
[52:14] throughout history, you know, men
[52:16] throughout history, strong, courageous
[52:18] men, they would make a stand. They would
[52:21] I'm reminded of Martin Luther when he
[52:23] nails his thesis to the to the church
[52:25] door and he says, "Here I stand. I can
[52:29] do no other."
[52:31] I'm gonna tell you what he was. He
[52:32] wasn't a coward. He wasn't going to back
[52:34] down though no matter what it was going
[52:36] to cost him. I've preached here before
[52:40] of the words of Winston Churchill when
[52:42] when all when they when all seems lost
[52:46] and and and and the entire nation is
[52:48] gripped in fear because it was it looked
[52:51] like all hope was gone. And at the
[52:53] moment when the entire nation was in
[52:56] despair, was hiding, the entire nation
[52:59] and leaders were hiding, Winston
[53:01] Churchill grabs a microphone. You know,
[53:04] words are a powerful thing because your
[53:06] confession is a powerful thing
[53:09] and words have the power to change the
[53:12] circumstances.
[53:14] Don't ever underestimate the power of a
[53:18] confession of the word of God.
[53:21] Amen. Don't ever underestimate the power
[53:25] of what you say
[53:28] because the devil can't read your mind,
[53:30] but he can hear your words.
[53:33] I say this to the mothers and the
[53:35] fathers of this church, what we say
[53:37] about our children. Be careful what
[53:39] words you use. I say it to the brothers
[53:42] and sisters, what we say to each other,
[53:44] what we confess when the devil comes.
[53:46] I'm talking about serious things,
[53:48] doctor's reports and and and real issues
[53:50] and real life problems. Don't ever
[53:53] underestimate and be careful what you
[53:56] confess and what you say.
[53:58] Amen.
[53:59] Can I get an amen? Amen.
[54:01] I think of a man like Church Hill who
[54:03] could say and take a microphone in the
[54:06] midst of a shaking, quaking nation where
[54:09] other men are retreating and other
[54:11] nations are retreating. And Winston
[54:13] Churchill grabs a microphone and says,
[54:15] "We shall fight on the beaches. We shall
[54:18] fight in the streets. We shall fight in
[54:21] the landing grounds. We shall fight in
[54:23] the hills, but we shall never
[54:25] surrender." And that was his that was
[54:28] what a voice could speak out. and it
[54:30] energized an entire nation who in spite
[54:33] of their circumstance could reach out in
[54:35] faith because of the words of a brave
[54:37] man who spoke the word. I say today, if
[54:40] you're in fear and you're surrounded by
[54:42] pressure, start confessing the word of
[54:44] God and say, "I'm never going to
[54:46] surrender. I'm never going to be a
[54:48] coward. I'm never going to turn around.
[54:49] I'm going to keep pressing on no matter
[54:52] what comes my way, devil." Amen.
[54:56] Words have the power to change an entire
[55:00] family.
[55:02] Listen friends, we could preach all
[55:04] night on this and we don't have all
[55:05] night. So I'm not going to preach till
[55:06] Sunday.
[55:08] But we we can read about this that that
[55:10] there there was a there was a certain in
[55:12] a man there comes a certain point in the
[55:16] spider in the in the face of difficulty
[55:18] where he's resolved to a certain
[55:21] principle.
[55:23] This is what Churchill came to. It
[55:25] didn't matter what he lost. He was
[55:27] resolved to say I'm going to fight.
[55:31] Amen.
[55:32] And let my last dying breath, if I go
[55:35] down and smoke, let my last dying breath
[55:39] say, "I will never surrender to the
[55:43] devil.
[55:44] I will never surrender, Satan. I'll
[55:47] fight you in the church. I'll fight you
[55:49] on my knees. I'll fight you in the pull
[55:51] pit. I'll fight you in the schools. I'll
[55:54] fight you, Satan. I'll fight you when
[55:56] you come against my family. I'll fight
[55:58] you if you try to take my body. If you
[56:00] try to come and attack my loved ones,
[56:02] I'm going to stand here. I'm not
[56:03] surrendering, devil.
[56:06] I'm going to take the word. I'm going to
[56:08] take God at his word and watch God prove
[56:11] his word.
[56:12] That's what God needs to somebody to
[56:14] take a stand for his word.
[56:18] moments of great courage, inspirational,
[56:22] powerful acts of men who made bold
[56:27] statements in the face of great
[56:30] difficulties.
[56:32] I'm going to tell you the most boldest,
[56:34] most courageous words ever spoken was
[56:38] actually spoken by Jesus
[56:41] when he's faced with death
[56:44] and he knows his end. This is so
[56:46] powerful. Read this just here a few
[56:48] moments before coming out. In Matthew 20
[56:52] verse 17, notice this. Matthew 20, if
[56:55] you could pull it up if you could. I'm
[56:57] going to show you a real masculine
[56:59] statement, a real man who could really
[57:01] take a stand. Jesus says in Matthew 20
[57:05] verse verse 17, you got that Ethan? And
[57:07] Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the 12
[57:10] disciples apart in the way and he's
[57:12] going to say something to them.
[57:14] Amen. He took them to the woods. He took
[57:16] them to the side. And Jesus says in
[57:19] verse 18, "Behold, here they are. We go
[57:22] up to Jerusalem."
[57:24] Amen.
[57:26] Now, this if you read the next words,
[57:28] "And the son of man shall be betrayed by
[57:29] the unto the chief priest and unto the
[57:31] scribes." This is what I'm facing. But
[57:34] Jesus speaks words and says, "Behold, we
[57:37] go up to Jerusalem." He wasn't a coward.
[57:41] He wasn't going to back down. He was
[57:43] going to face what laid in front of him.
[57:48] Behold,
[57:50] we go up to Jerusalem. May seem like
[57:54] something so simple to you, but I think
[57:55] it's so powerful.
[57:57] In the face of knowing what he was going
[58:00] to face, yet his confession, he wasn't
[58:04] just going to say it, he was going to
[58:05] follow it and be a doer of he was going
[58:07] to follow. He was going to put footsteps
[58:09] to what he was confessing.
[58:11] Amen.
[58:13] It's amazing because this is this is
[58:15] what happens even even in the modern
[58:18] world that we live in. We have a as Paul
[58:20] said, I fear lest by any means as the
[58:22] serpent begiled uh the mind of Eve from
[58:26] the simplicity that's in your in Christ.
[58:29] So also shall your minds also be
[58:32] deceived to to to to serve it to accept
[58:35] a Jesus
[58:37] who we have not preached.
[58:40] Oh, I'm just going to say it today.
[58:41] There is a Jesus being preached that
[58:45] Paul never preached.
[58:48] There is a there is a Jesus of the Bible
[58:51] who is preached and the weakening of
[58:53] pullpits and men who are afraid to speak
[58:56] the word of God and afraid of what it'll
[58:58] cost them has reformed and recreated a
[59:01] false image of Jesus. Even the
[59:04] feministic the the the the feminization
[59:07] of Jesus e even even as in in you find
[59:11] it in in worship modern worship music.
[59:13] You find it in modern pullpits and
[59:15] modern sermons of feel-good vibes and
[59:17] feel-good atmospheres
[59:19] and they feminize
[59:21] Jesus.
[59:23] Why you say because they they are bowing
[59:25] to the music of Nebuchadnezzar under the
[59:28] pressure to change and just get in line.
[59:32] remember we preached it here just a few
[59:34] maybe a maybe three weeks ago about a
[59:36] man who I was hearing and he got up to
[59:38] make a stand about the transgender and
[59:39] homosexuals. We accept you. We love you
[59:41] and we just want to make a bold
[59:43] statement. We love you here. And and
[59:44] again, I'll say it again. I'm not
[59:46] criticizing. I don't know the man's
[59:47] motive, but I'm just here to say you'll
[59:48] never help a man who has a demon spirit
[59:52] by patty caking and playing with it.
[59:54] You've got to speak the word.
[59:57] It's the only thing that'll set them
[59:59] free. Amen.
[1:00:04] And they they they they have they have
[1:00:06] recultured this modern Jesus, this
[1:00:10] modern uh uh uh feminine Jesus. H we we
[1:00:15] we we can see this even even uh let me
[1:00:18] just find my place here where we can
[1:00:21] even see this. Let me just say this to
[1:00:22] you friends. I'll just go ahead and say
[1:00:23] this. He was a sacrificial lamb lamb,
[1:00:26] but he was also the lion of the tribe of
[1:00:29] Judah. He was a lamb, but he was also a
[1:00:31] lion. He was also a warrior. Brother
[1:00:33] Brandham said when the when he went down
[1:00:35] and descended to the lower parts of
[1:00:37] hell, it wasn't that meek and lowly. He
[1:00:40] Jesus, he said, but it was the mighty
[1:00:42] conqueror going to conquer the devil's
[1:00:45] kingdom.
[1:00:47] And so even today, we we if we're not
[1:00:49] careful, we can misrepresent
[1:00:52] what the Bible gives of Jesus. It's why
[1:00:55] it's so important to read the word of
[1:00:57] God for yourself. Can you say amen?
[1:01:00] And if and the world today has produced
[1:01:03] an image of a a false image as as Jesus
[1:01:07] as Paul says that you would you would
[1:01:10] follow another Jesus whom we have not
[1:01:13] preached and another Jesus whom we have
[1:01:16] not taught.
[1:01:18] Amen.
[1:01:18] And they preach a an anemic an anemic
[1:01:22] Jesus with no power. Come on, somebody
[1:01:25] help me here tonight.
[1:01:28] an anemic Jesus with no power and he's
[1:01:31] just, you know, almost even the
[1:01:33] paintings that you can see of even from
[1:01:35] Catholicism. And listen, friends, you I
[1:01:38] mean this, you got to be careful what
[1:01:40] some of the images you you take in that
[1:01:43] replace the definition of Jesus in the
[1:01:46] Bible.
[1:01:47] Cuz sometimes Catholicism has a great
[1:01:50] influence on on on images. you do an
[1:01:53] image search of some of the apostles and
[1:01:55] and and you wonder, man, is that really
[1:01:57] what I'm not sure that's what they look
[1:01:58] like. You got to be careful with that.
[1:02:01] But but c Catholicism even even some of
[1:02:03] the images you can see of Jesus,
[1:02:06] it almost presents a very soft very soft
[1:02:10] smile and very feministic and very weak.
[1:02:17] Hello. Amen.
[1:02:20] And so you you have this you have this
[1:02:22] gentle, you know, loving, you know,
[1:02:25] Jesus standing even as we preach on
[1:02:27] Sunday standing at the door and and
[1:02:29] knocking. And I believe that. I I
[1:02:31] absolutely believe that he's a kind,
[1:02:33] loving, compassionate heavenly father.
[1:02:35] But brother Brandham says, "Don't just
[1:02:36] tell me that he's just a God of mercy.
[1:02:38] He's also a God of judgment.
[1:02:40] And as we said on Sunday, you'll never
[1:02:42] know his grace until you know his wrath.
[1:02:45] You'll never know his goodness until you
[1:02:47] weigh his severity and the severity of
[1:02:50] the word of God. And so the entire world
[1:02:52] hates Why do you think this is? Because
[1:02:54] the world hates masculinity.
[1:02:56] The the world, the common cultural world
[1:02:59] calls biblical word-based ma manhood
[1:03:03] toxic.
[1:03:05] It's male chauvinism. It's toxic. You
[1:03:07] try to tell that to people and some of
[1:03:09] your co-workers about, you know, your
[1:03:10] about your home and how your home is
[1:03:12] construct of your home. how the wife is
[1:03:14] the homemaker and she stays at home and
[1:03:17] you know that they they would I've had
[1:03:19] they look at you like you're bonkers.
[1:03:20] What are you doing? You're just
[1:03:22] suppressing your wife and and you're
[1:03:23] just you they listen they they don't
[1:03:25] know what it's like to have a home and
[1:03:27] not a house.
[1:03:30] Because a true woman in a true place has
[1:03:32] an atmosphere of that home and that man
[1:03:34] comes to that house and it's not a
[1:03:36] house. It's a home. It's an atmosphere.
[1:03:38] It's a family created in the image of
[1:03:41] God. But they would they would never
[1:03:43] understand that. They would never listen
[1:03:45] friends. They the modern world today
[1:03:47] would call what we call life and family
[1:03:51] life toxic and suppressive.
[1:03:56] And there's a pressure that goes with
[1:03:58] that. They they they they despise any
[1:04:02] Let me say it. The more and more time
[1:04:04] goes, the more and more they will
[1:04:06] despise biblical values.
[1:04:10] Amen. And so you say, "What are they
[1:04:12] going to do then? They're going to shut
[1:04:13] us up." No, they won't. The rather than
[1:04:16] Satan would much rather not shut the the
[1:04:19] church up. He'd rather just change what
[1:04:21] the word says and change what the
[1:04:24] pullpit is preaching.
[1:04:26] So he modernizes it and rec. And you
[1:04:28] know what? The carnal mind will always
[1:04:29] with itching ears, they'll always go
[1:04:31] towards that direction.
[1:04:33] Yes. Amen.
[1:04:35] Hello, somebody.
[1:04:37] Same reason why some people leave the
[1:04:38] message and they say it was just rules.
[1:04:40] It was just prison to them. That's the
[1:04:42] carnal mind speaking.
[1:04:44] It's just rules and regulations and
[1:04:46] prison. Oh, I don't know about you. It's
[1:04:48] not prison to me. It's the joy of my
[1:04:50] life. It's the passion of my life. I see
[1:04:54] a hand of Some see a hand of judgment. I
[1:04:56] see a hand of mercy. Some see a hand of
[1:04:59] of of condemnation. I see the loving
[1:05:01] hand of my father who cares enough about
[1:05:04] my soul to tell me the truth.
[1:05:07] I see protection, not prison walls.
[1:05:09] Amen.
[1:05:11] So they they deem it uh uh uh uh toxic.
[1:05:16] This is why even the one of the greatest
[1:05:19] read this just this afternoon. The the
[1:05:21] one of the top Billboard charts was a a
[1:05:25] a female artist who wrote a song called
[1:05:27] God is a Woman and it top the number one
[1:05:31] uh on the Billboard top 100 list for
[1:05:34] weeks. Why? Because they're they they
[1:05:37] there there is an agenda to redefine
[1:05:41] God,
[1:05:42] to redefine Jesus. cuz they won't just
[1:05:45] reject Jesus. No, you have to understand
[1:05:48] Satan is just as religious. Cain was
[1:05:51] just as religious as Abel was.
[1:05:54] He's much more interested in keeping the
[1:05:56] church open with a false gospel than
[1:05:59] closing the doors of the church.
[1:06:03] He's much more interested in appealing
[1:06:05] to the spiritual religious mind. And
[1:06:08] someone has a little bit of light in
[1:06:09] their heart and they have just a little
[1:06:11] bit of light. So Satan will come and
[1:06:13] pervert that and put all the light that
[1:06:15] they have out and they'll call light
[1:06:17] darkness and darkness they'll call
[1:06:19] light.
[1:06:20] Amen.
[1:06:20] It's the world that we live in.
[1:06:23] And so you notice this? This is even you
[1:06:25] say, "Brother Matt, how do we get to
[1:06:27] this place? Weak pull pits."
[1:06:29] Amen.
[1:06:31] And let me just let me just throw this
[1:06:33] in here. I'm not just talking about this
[1:06:37] box right here we call a pull pit.
[1:06:40] I'm not just talking about this church
[1:06:42] and this pull pit, but the entire body
[1:06:45] of Christ. You've got a pullpit. You've
[1:06:47] got a word that you're living in, that
[1:06:49] you're confessing, and that you believe.
[1:06:51] And weak Christianity.
[1:06:55] And weak lives.
[1:06:57] Amen.
[1:06:57] Somebody help me here tonight.
[1:07:00] It's been weak pull pits. The church has
[1:07:03] been so so so so uh uh uh uh craving of
[1:07:08] of a modern message with modern jokes
[1:07:12] and and comedians and and and a pastor
[1:07:14] gets up and 30 minutes of his sermon is
[1:07:17] just a comedic strip of of of words and
[1:07:20] things that he's lined out to make sure
[1:07:22] he gets a good laugh. Right.
[1:07:29] You say, "Brother Matt,
[1:07:31] what does that produce?" It produces a
[1:07:34] Jesus that they want,
[1:07:37] but not a Jesus who was sent.
[1:07:41] It produces a Jesus who they crave for,
[1:07:44] but not the Jesus of the Bible. Amen.
[1:07:49] And consequently, we're left with a
[1:07:52] Jesus who's just a weakling and a wimp.
[1:07:55] He's just there in your back pocket to
[1:07:57] give you everything that you want and
[1:07:59] and and and then some. He's there to
[1:08:02] fulfill your dreams. He's there to give
[1:08:04] your business more customers and and and
[1:08:07] and bigger bank accounts and bigger
[1:08:09] pockets. That's all Jesus has been
[1:08:11] reduced to. just a just a weakling, just
[1:08:15] a passive, you know, passive tolerant,
[1:08:19] tolerant of everything, tolerant of your
[1:08:21] of our sins, tolerant of our attitudes,
[1:08:24] tolerant of our feelings.
[1:08:27] But let me present to you what the Bible
[1:08:29] tells me about Jesus. My Jesus is
[1:08:32] supreme.
[1:08:34] My Jesus is king.
[1:08:36] Oh, come on. Do I have some of his
[1:08:38] people here tonight? I said, my Jesus is
[1:08:41] king. He's King Jesus. He's reigning on
[1:08:44] his throne. He's supreme authority.
[1:08:48] And he's not only my savior, he's also
[1:08:51] my judge. He's also my lord. He's also
[1:08:54] the ruler of my life.
[1:08:57] As brother random says, and then the
[1:08:58] door endorses. And he says when he comes
[1:09:01] into your house, he doesn't just want to
[1:09:02] stay at the front door. He's coming in
[1:09:04] to take over. He's coming in to take
[1:09:06] over your home. He's coming over to take
[1:09:09] the reigns. And I say, "Oh God, take
[1:09:11] over my house, Lord. Take over my home.
[1:09:14] I give it up to you, Lord Jesus."
[1:09:18] This is exactly how the devil tries to
[1:09:21] get in as we're just going to look a
[1:09:22] little bit further here in Daniel
[1:09:24] chapter 3. Notice what they what they
[1:09:26] say. Eat the king's drink. Eat the
[1:09:29] king's meat and drink his wine. You
[1:09:31] know, Daniel proves something very very
[1:09:33] small. He he proves something very
[1:09:35] amazing as the Bible records. And Daniel
[1:09:38] says, "Okay." And you know what Daniel
[1:09:40] does? He refuses.
[1:09:42] Yeah.
[1:09:43] You say, "That's such a small thing,
[1:09:45] Daniel. I mean, really, you're going to
[1:09:48] make a big stink over what you drink,
[1:09:51] and it's just different kind of food."
[1:09:53] Come on, really? I mean, is it really
[1:09:56] that big of a deal?
[1:09:59] Oh, but Daniel understood when you take
[1:10:01] a stand for the small things in your
[1:10:04] life.
[1:10:06] Then you'll have the faith to take a
[1:10:08] stand for the big things that come.
[1:10:11] And most of the time, the reason people
[1:10:13] fall under the big pressure is because
[1:10:15] they never took a stand when it was just
[1:10:16] a small thing.
[1:10:20] He takes a stand for just a little bit
[1:10:24] of ground. He could have given just a
[1:10:27] little bit of ground. Come on, don't be
[1:10:29] so firm. We got to be just give a
[1:10:32] little. You know, that's the tactic of
[1:10:34] the enemy.
[1:10:36] Don't be so firm. And so now we find our
[1:10:39] place in Daniel. Turn there. Daniel
[1:10:41] chapter 3. Notice this here.
[1:10:43] Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[1:10:45] commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach,
[1:10:47] and Abedneo. Then they brought these men
[1:10:49] before the king. Nebuchadnezzar spoke
[1:10:51] and said unto them, "Is it true? Is it
[1:10:54] real? Like this is real? like re like
[1:10:57] really really Shadrach, Meshach, you've
[1:10:59] been in my courts. You've been I've made
[1:11:01] you rulers. I've put you in high places
[1:11:03] in my economy and here I'm having a
[1:11:06] little celebration and a little party
[1:11:08] and you can't just go with the flow and
[1:11:10] you know just do like everybody else
[1:11:12] does. No, a real two true believer won't
[1:11:15] give the devil one inch.
[1:11:17] I said a real true believer won't give
[1:11:19] the devil one inch. They won't
[1:11:21] compromise. If it's just persuasion,
[1:11:24] you'll compromise. If it's just
[1:11:26] persuasion, when you get around the
[1:11:27] right people and the right crowd, you do
[1:11:29] the right thing, you live the right kind
[1:11:31] of life, you dress the right way. But
[1:11:33] let me just say this. If you get around
[1:11:34] your worldly people and worldly
[1:11:36] associates, if it's just a persuasion
[1:11:38] and not a conviction, you'll dress
[1:11:39] different. You'll talk different. You'll
[1:11:41] walk different. Come on, somebody help
[1:11:43] me preach. If it's really just a
[1:11:45] persuasion when friends and pressure and
[1:11:47] co-workers and associates, even other
[1:11:50] family members,
[1:11:53] you'll change the way that you look. He
[1:11:55] won't be so so so bold.
[1:11:58] Oh friends, don't you realize the
[1:12:00] world's they need a bold message.
[1:12:04] They need a bold believer who's on fire
[1:12:08] for the with passion to live the word of
[1:12:11] God, not a weakling. They see, don't you
[1:12:13] realize the world sees enough of
[1:12:15] socialized and culturized Christians who
[1:12:18] will take a little social drink here,
[1:12:20] little social drink there, watch a
[1:12:23] little movie here. It doesn't matter if
[1:12:24] you go to the moon. Doesn't matter
[1:12:26] really what you watch. Come on. Has a
[1:12:27] little bit of profanity. But you know,
[1:12:29] we hear that every day. It's not really
[1:12:30] that big of a deal. Don't Don't you
[1:12:32] realize that if you don't have a real
[1:12:34] revelation in your heart, you'll bow
[1:12:36] under pressure. But let me just say, if
[1:12:38] you've got a real true conviction from
[1:12:40] the Holy Ghost, it don't matter if it
[1:12:42] cost you everything in your life. You
[1:12:45] will not compromise. You will take a
[1:12:47] stand for the word of God. You'll say,
[1:12:49] "I'm going to I'm going to take a stand
[1:12:51] for what's true. Amen.
[1:12:54] Amen.
[1:12:55] Nebuchadnezzar says, "Is it true
[1:13:01] is the I love this." And he says in his
[1:13:04] rage and fury, you can imagine how mad
[1:13:06] he was.
[1:13:08] You see some people as they get that
[1:13:09] same demon spirit on them when you don't
[1:13:11] say the right pronoun or say the right
[1:13:13] word or you say the wrong thing about
[1:13:15] gender,
[1:13:17] they don't just get offended, they get
[1:13:19] enraged.
[1:13:22] It's a spirit. Call it what it is.
[1:13:25] That's not that person.
[1:13:27] That's not that individual. That's a
[1:13:29] demon spirit
[1:13:31] resisting the word of God. Shadrach,
[1:13:33] Meshach, and Abedneo, verse 16, said to
[1:13:35] the king, "Oh, Nebuchadnezzar, we're not
[1:13:37] careful to answer thee in this matter.
[1:13:40] If it be so, our God whom we serve is
[1:13:43] able to deliver us from the burning
[1:13:46] fiery furnace, and he will deliver us
[1:13:48] out of thy hand, oh king.
[1:13:52] This is what faith says. Faith says,
[1:13:54] "I'll confess what the word of God says,
[1:13:56] no matter what it cost me."
[1:14:00] I said, "Let me that that that maybe you
[1:14:02] didn't hear me. The word of go This is
[1:14:03] what faith says. I'll I will confess the
[1:14:07] word of God no matter what it cost me.
[1:14:11] No matter what the king says, no matter
[1:14:13] what my dad says, no matter what my mom
[1:14:16] says, no matter what my school friends
[1:14:18] say, no matter what the church people
[1:14:20] say, no matter what you label me, no
[1:14:23] matter what you call me, I'm going to
[1:14:25] take a stand for the word of God. I'm
[1:14:28] going to take a stand for what is true
[1:14:31] and I'm going to confess what the word
[1:14:32] says. But notice verse 18. This is so
[1:14:34] much more powerful than verse 17. But if
[1:14:37] not,
[1:14:39] verse 18, but if not, do you realize
[1:14:45] what you're saying?
[1:14:47] Well, you're saying that even if you go
[1:14:50] into the fire and you burn,
[1:14:54] do you realize before you make a bold
[1:14:56] statement like this, Shadrach, Meshach,
[1:14:59] and Abedneo,
[1:15:01] but if not, this is what their answer
[1:15:04] says.
[1:15:06] Be it known unto thee, O king,
[1:15:11] that we will not bow,
[1:15:14] we will not bend.
[1:15:17] We will not compromise.
[1:15:20] It doesn't matter the outcome of my
[1:15:23] confession of faith. Oh, come on. Do I
[1:15:26] have some real believers here tonight?
[1:15:28] This answer is straight, firm, direct,
[1:15:32] and resolute.
[1:15:34] Be it known. If not, oh king, even if he
[1:15:40] doesn't.
[1:15:42] Amen.
[1:15:42] Can you say that tonight? Can we have a
[1:15:44] bold faith to say it doesn't matter the
[1:15:48] results of what my confession is
[1:15:51] confession of confessing does not change
[1:15:55] my attitude towards the word of God.
[1:15:58] Even if I burn this was their confession
[1:16:02] even if not be it known we will not
[1:16:06] serve thy gods nor worship the golden
[1:16:09] image which thou has set up. This was a
[1:16:12] principle that would no matter what
[1:16:14] comes, this was a m This was a mind that
[1:16:17] was made up. This was a mind of courage.
[1:16:20] This was a mind of determination that
[1:16:22] says, "I'm a soldier in the army of the
[1:16:24] Lord and I'm not going to retreat.
[1:16:26] There's no retreat in my vocabulary. It
[1:16:29] doesn't matter if I burn. It doesn't
[1:16:31] matter what the outcome is. I'm not
[1:16:33] going to compromise. I'm not going to
[1:16:35] bend." Oh, help me preach here tonight,
[1:16:37] church. It doesn't matter what happens
[1:16:39] in my life.
[1:16:41] Even if God doesn't heal me, it doesn't
[1:16:44] mean he's not a healer. Even if God does
[1:16:46] not deliver, it doesn't mean he's not.
[1:16:48] You say, "That's what real faith is."
[1:16:50] That's what real true faith. When you
[1:16:53] take a stand for the word of God, it's
[1:16:56] saying it doesn't matter the outcome.
[1:17:00] Amen.
[1:17:01] God is still a healer.
[1:17:04] God is still a savior.
[1:17:06] God is still a deliverer.
[1:17:09] God is still a provider. It doesn't
[1:17:11] matter the outcome. I'm not going to bow
[1:17:14] down to your image
[1:17:17] because true faith has muscles.
[1:17:22] I said true faith has great big muscles.
[1:17:28] In fact, it's got hair on its chest.
[1:17:34] True faith does.
[1:17:35] It's burly. It's masculine.
[1:17:39] It takes a stand for the word of God. It
[1:17:42] doesn't matter. You know, that's the
[1:17:44] kind of faith God's looking for.
[1:17:46] He's not looking for the hyped up and
[1:17:48] you can get hyped up. He's not looking
[1:17:50] for the hyped up, ppped up. He's looking
[1:17:52] for the true resolve and a real believer
[1:17:54] that says, "It doesn't matter the
[1:17:56] outcome, Lord. I'm going to serve you
[1:17:57] anyhow. Doesn't matter what my tomorrow
[1:18:00] says. I'm going to go on with Jesus
[1:18:02] anyhow. Doesn't matter what comes my
[1:18:05] way. I'm going to keep confessing a
[1:18:08] perfect promise and a perfect word and a
[1:18:10] perfect God who's more than able and
[1:18:13] more than enough. It doesn't matter what
[1:18:15] happens. I'm going to take my stand and
[1:18:18] watch God back up his word. Well, that's
[1:18:21] the way to get to you want to get to
[1:18:22] God. That's how you got to get to God.
[1:18:24] You say, "I got a need in my body. I got
[1:18:26] a need in my family." That's how you get
[1:18:28] to God. Brother Brandham says, "How do
[1:18:30] you get to God?" Be on his hands.
[1:18:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:35] Be on his hands. Go to put my PowerPoint
[1:18:37] there. Slide three. Brother Brandham
[1:18:38] says that's the way you want to get God.
[1:18:41] Be on his hands every morning, every
[1:18:43] night, every day, all the time,
[1:18:46] constantly.
[1:18:48] Just keep seeking. He's talking about
[1:18:50] that little woman who won't stop
[1:18:51] knocking on that unjust judge and he's
[1:18:54] knocking on his door and knocking on his
[1:18:55] door. Brother Random says, "That's how
[1:18:57] you get your answer to God. You be on
[1:18:59] his hand. Say, I got something I need,
[1:19:01] Lord. What are you doing? I'm
[1:19:02] approaching your throne again." But you
[1:19:04] didn't get your answer yesterday, but
[1:19:06] I'm back here today. But you didn't get
[1:19:07] your answer last week, but I'm back here
[1:19:09] today. God, I'm going to be on your
[1:19:11] hands.
[1:19:13] Just keep seeking. Just keep asking.
[1:19:16] Just keep knocking. Don't knock a little
[1:19:18] while and get tired and go away. Just
[1:19:21] keep standing there.
[1:19:24] Say, "Lord, I'm here and I'm not going
[1:19:26] to leave. I'm on your hands now.
[1:19:31] I'm going to stay right here." here.
[1:19:33] This is perseverance 1963. You getting
[1:19:36] tired listening?
[1:19:39] Brother Brandham says that. He says,
[1:19:40] "I'm going to stay." This is what your
[1:19:41] prayer is to the Lord. I'm going to stay
[1:19:43] right here. Lord, you tired of me. You
[1:19:44] tired of listening? I'm having a great
[1:19:46] time knocking.
[1:19:50] I'm going to keep knocking.
[1:19:53] I'm going to keep knocking. You ever
[1:19:54] have somebody do that? Your little
[1:19:55] brother, your little sister, and they
[1:19:56] just keep knocking and knocking. It gets
[1:19:59] annoying.
[1:20:00] It gets irritating.
[1:20:03] You know, this is what brother Brandham
[1:20:04] says you do to God. You keep knocking.
[1:20:06] You stay on his hands. Come on,
[1:20:08] somebody. You catching it here tonight?
[1:20:10] Brother Brandham says, "You tired of
[1:20:12] listening?" I'm having a great time
[1:20:13] knocking cuz I know you're coming. Amen.
[1:20:16] That's when something happens.
[1:20:19] He has to get you off his hand. He comes
[1:20:22] out to answer you. Now, faith finds
[1:20:25] this. There's only one thing you can you
[1:20:27] can He says, "There's only one thing can
[1:20:29] hold this sword. That's the hand of
[1:20:31] faith. The hand of faith is the only
[1:20:34] thing that can yield the sword of faith.
[1:20:36] Uh the the sword of the word. Now, you
[1:20:38] might have a weak arm, just enough to
[1:20:40] pick it up for justification. You're so
[1:20:42] weak, maybe that's all you can cut
[1:20:44] through. But this sword of the word will
[1:20:46] cut free every promise that God made in
[1:20:49] it. If they got a good, strong arm of
[1:20:51] faith, holding it there, saying, "I
[1:20:54] believe God for my healing. I believe
[1:20:56] God for How many believers do we have
[1:20:58] here tonight? I believe God for my
[1:21:01] healing. I believe God for my baptism.
[1:21:03] God made the promise. And faith lays
[1:21:06] hold. He holds this sword and it'll cut
[1:21:09] her out. Brother Adam says God made the
[1:21:11] promise. Faith holds this sword. It'll
[1:21:14] cut her out the rock yonder. Every
[1:21:16] promise of God can be cut free
[1:21:20] by the word of God.
[1:21:22] For it's a sword.
[1:21:24] How, brother Matt? By standing your
[1:21:27] ground. standing your ground with the
[1:21:29] devil. Brother Brandham talks about this
[1:21:31] little woman and he says she had many
[1:21:34] hindrances.
[1:21:36] She had many hindrances, but her faith
[1:21:40] didn't have any.
[1:21:44] I said she had many hindrances, but her
[1:21:47] faith didn't have any. And you might
[1:21:50] have a lot of hindrances. Every person
[1:21:52] that starts out to meet Christ will find
[1:21:54] you got a lot of hindrances, but your
[1:21:56] faith don't have any. Faith don't have
[1:21:58] no hindrance. Faith has hairs on his
[1:22:01] chest. Great big muscles. Reason rises
[1:22:04] up and said, you know, it's reasonable.
[1:22:07] Faith pulls his muscles back and sticks
[1:22:10] out his big chest. Listen to what
[1:22:12] brother Brandham says here. Faith pulls
[1:22:14] uh the voice rises up and says, "Oh,
[1:22:16] that don't sound too reasonable. You're
[1:22:17] getting a little bit crazy. You're
[1:22:19] getting a little bit bold there.
[1:22:20] Everyone's going to think you're an
[1:22:21] oddball. Faith pulls back his muscles,
[1:22:24] sticks out his big chest and says, "Shut
[1:22:26] up and sit down." And reason jumps over
[1:22:29] in his corner and takes his stool. I say
[1:22:32] you ought to speak to the devil tonight
[1:22:34] and say, "Devil, go back where you
[1:22:35] belong." Reasoning, go back where you
[1:22:38] belong. You don't belong in my body
[1:22:40] doubt. You don't belong in my body fear.
[1:22:42] I've got the word of God. It's my
[1:22:44] answer. Every time, anytime the devil
[1:22:47] comes,
[1:22:49] I've got the answer in the word of God.
[1:22:51] Faith has got muscles.
[1:22:54] He means what he says.
[1:22:59] Come on. Do we have some believers here
[1:23:01] tonight?
[1:23:02] Just press right on through. Your faith
[1:23:05] takes you right on. See, have faith has
[1:23:07] no hindrance. It goes on anyhow.
[1:23:10] Nothing's going to stop it. Amen.
[1:23:12] As I said, it's brony big muscles. It's
[1:23:16] got the floor. I love how Brother
[1:23:18] Brandham dramatizes this. Rest of them
[1:23:20] is scared of it. Yes, sir. They'll run
[1:23:22] from it like smallpox.
[1:23:24] They just get plum away. Haven't got
[1:23:26] nothing to do with that. When faith, big
[1:23:28] faith rises up. Say, "I know who I
[1:23:32] believe. I'm persuaded."
[1:23:35] That's it. That's how you get faith to
[1:23:37] believe. You don't confess what your
[1:23:38] symptoms say. You don't confess what the
[1:23:41] doctor says. You confess the word of God
[1:23:43] and faith begins to build and and faith
[1:23:46] begins to lay hold on the promise of
[1:23:49] God. Start confessing the word of God.
[1:23:51] You say, "I need faith, brother Matt."
[1:23:53] Start confessing the word of God. Watch
[1:23:55] faith begin to rise up. Oh, my brother,
[1:23:57] my sister, it's inside of you.
[1:24:01] Say, don't feel it. It's inside of the
[1:24:03] seed God put inside there. God put
[1:24:05] something inside of a believer to accept
[1:24:07] the word of God. God, I said, God, put
[1:24:10] something inside of his family to
[1:24:13] believe the word of God in spite of any
[1:24:15] circumstance. There's something inside
[1:24:17] of you that's a part of you. If you'll
[1:24:19] just start confessing the word of God,
[1:24:22] you'll lay hold on the promise of God.
[1:24:26] Brother Brandham says, notice this.
[1:24:28] Faith has no hindrance. They'll run from
[1:24:30] it. Brother Brandham says, I know in
[1:24:31] whom I have believed. That's it. There's
[1:24:33] no fear in faith. Faith knows about it.
[1:24:36] Faith, as I've always said, this is why
[1:24:38] Christ speak. It's got great big
[1:24:40] muscles.
[1:24:41] Yeah.
[1:24:42] And hairs on the chest.
[1:24:45] Faith said, "Shut up."
[1:24:49] I'm not allowed to say that word. You
[1:24:50] are to the devil.
[1:24:55] Say, "Don't say that. Don't say it to
[1:24:56] your brother, to your sister. Don't say
[1:24:58] definitely don't say it to your mom and
[1:24:59] your daddy." But when the devil comes
[1:25:01] knocking on your door, big faith rises
[1:25:04] up with big muscles and says, "Shut up,
[1:25:06] devil." That's all. I know where I'm at.
[1:25:10] Hallelujah. The rest of them say, "Well,
[1:25:12] maybe he does." But you've got to stand
[1:25:15] up and show your muscles. I said, "I
[1:25:17] know this is simple, church, but I want
[1:25:19] to get it through us here tonight to
[1:25:20] give us faith." He says, "That's all
[1:25:23] you've got to stand up and show your
[1:25:25] muscles." Amen.
[1:25:29] You think you're showing your muscles
[1:25:31] when you're doubting the word and the
[1:25:32] promise of God.
[1:25:34] You think we're show we're you think
[1:25:35] we're showing our muscles when things
[1:25:36] aren't going our way and we come to
[1:25:38] Wednesday night church and the song
[1:25:39] leaders worshiping and we just sort of
[1:25:41] stand there and just sort of barely open
[1:25:43] our mouth and everybody knows
[1:25:46] something's happening that's not good.
[1:25:50] Hello.
[1:25:52] You think you're showing your muscles
[1:25:54] then? You know, you know what you're
[1:25:55] doing? You're showing the devil that
[1:25:56] he's got you whipped.
[1:25:58] And brother Brandon says when he sees
[1:26:00] you down like that, he really pours it
[1:26:02] on.
[1:26:03] You're not showing the de You're not
[1:26:04] showing the Lord that you believe.
[1:26:05] You're showing the devil what you're
[1:26:06] doing's working. Devil, keep doing it. I
[1:26:09] say tonight, no matter how you feel, no
[1:26:11] matter what you came in here feeling
[1:26:12] like, it's time your faith stands up and
[1:26:15] says, "Shut up, devil. Shut up, devil.
[1:26:18] You're not going to have my children.
[1:26:19] You're not going to have my body. You're
[1:26:21] not going to have my health. I'm
[1:26:23] purchased by the lamb of God. I have
[1:26:25] been purchased and bought with the
[1:26:27] precious blood. I'm going to confess his
[1:26:29] word.
[1:26:31] He says, "Shut up." Russ says, "Well,
[1:26:33] maybe he does, but you've got to stand
[1:26:35] up and show your faith."
[1:26:37] You know, the faith that Moses had
[1:26:39] didn't believe in a so far. This is what
[1:26:41] Pharaoh begins to say to say to him.
[1:26:44] Brother Brandon begins to pick this up
[1:26:45] and why why Christ speak. And he says,
[1:26:48] he says here, now notice Pharaoh, just
[1:26:51] going to change just here just for a
[1:26:52] moment. Make sure I didn't have make
[1:26:54] sure I didn't miss anything. I might
[1:26:55] have skipped something there. Uh, what
[1:26:58] do we got for the next slide, Ethan?
[1:26:59] Now, yes, Pharaoh used his wisdom on
[1:27:01] Moses. The watch, he said, I'll tell you
[1:27:04] what. Ah, I'll make an agreement with
[1:27:06] you after the plagues don't eat him up.
[1:27:09] Said, I'll make an agreement with you.
[1:27:11] You just go for a little worship. Three
[1:27:14] days, just go so far and don't go no
[1:27:17] further. But, you know, that was
[1:27:20] Pharaoh's senses told him that. See, you
[1:27:22] just go so far. In other words, the
[1:27:25] devil doesn't mind if you have a little
[1:27:26] rejoicing in church on Wednesday night,
[1:27:29] but on Thursday, you better be back to
[1:27:30] the same old deep, dark dungeon that you
[1:27:33] were in on Tuesday.
[1:27:35] He don't get scared when we shout and
[1:27:37] rejoice in church. He don't get scared
[1:27:38] when you shout and praise in church and
[1:27:40] you jump and dance. He gets scared when
[1:27:42] on Thursday and on Monday when all hell
[1:27:44] is breaking loose against you, your
[1:27:45] confession still confesses the word of
[1:27:47] God. Your body still rejoicing. You're
[1:27:50] still shouting and you're still praising
[1:27:52] because you know the same God who you
[1:27:54] felt on Wednesday is faithful to his own
[1:27:56] word and his own promise.
[1:27:59] Brother Brandon says he says you know
[1:28:01] just go just a little bit further you
[1:28:03] know just just just a little bit.
[1:28:05] Pharaoh says you know don't go don't go
[1:28:07] so far. He says don't go so far. You
[1:28:10] just go so far and don't go no further.
[1:28:13] Go to the next slide. I've lost my
[1:28:14] place. But you know the faith that Moses
[1:28:17] had didn't believe in a so far religion.
[1:28:19] Let me just say the bride of Christ
[1:28:21] don't believe in a sofa religion.
[1:28:23] He said we're going all the way.
[1:28:26] That's right. We're going to the
[1:28:28] promised land. We just don't go out here
[1:28:30] and make a denomination and stop. We go
[1:28:32] on through. Amen. I'm going to the
[1:28:34] promised land. God promised us it. Go to
[1:28:37] the next slide. He says, "How many
[1:28:39] Pharaohs have we got today standing in
[1:28:41] the pullpit, heads of organizations."
[1:28:43] Now, if you just do this and just do
[1:28:45] that, that's all. Well, see, just so
[1:28:47] far. But Moses said, "Oh, no, no, no,
[1:28:50] no, no."
[1:28:51] Moses said, "Oh, no, no, no." Pharaoh
[1:28:53] said, "Well, why not? If you're going to
[1:28:55] have that kind of religion, I tell you
[1:28:57] what you do." This is what the devil,
[1:28:59] you know what? You know what, brother
[1:29:00] showing us here? The devil will always,
[1:29:01] if he doesn't sell you on one lie, he'll
[1:29:05] always reinterpret. Make it a little bit
[1:29:06] more ple, a little bit more reasonable.
[1:29:08] Tor, you'll finally go, you know what?
[1:29:10] Okay, devil. I can believe that. And if
[1:29:13] you're not careful, you let the devil
[1:29:14] reinterpret what God told you and change
[1:29:16] it and renarrate it.
[1:29:19] And God gave you a promise and said,
[1:29:21] "I'm going to do this." And the devil
[1:29:22] comes, you know, maybe the Lord didn't
[1:29:24] really mean that the way that he said
[1:29:25] it. Maybe it was spiritual. It wasn't
[1:29:27] really just a revelation you were going
[1:29:29] to get. It wasn't actually something
[1:29:30] that was going to happen. And he'll try
[1:29:33] to reinterpret it and water it down,
[1:29:35] wash it down, water it down. Favor said,
[1:29:38] "Well, why not?" You know, okay, if
[1:29:39] you're going to do that, if you're going
[1:29:41] to have that kind of religion, I'll tell
[1:29:42] you what you do. Just you and the elders
[1:29:44] go worship. See, just, in other words,
[1:29:46] just you and the deacons and all the
[1:29:47] preachers and all all the ministry, but
[1:29:50] don't let that get started in the whole
[1:29:51] church. I don't want the whole church
[1:29:53] becoming fanatical.
[1:29:56] You can have all that kind of religion.
[1:29:59] He says, you can have all that kind of
[1:30:00] religion, but don't let it don't let it
[1:30:03] get to don't let it He says, don't let
[1:30:05] it get among the people. Next slide. He
[1:30:07] says, "You know what Moses said? There
[1:30:10] won't even be a hoof left behind.
[1:30:16] In case you didn't hear me, Pharaoh,
[1:30:20] I'm not buying your lies.
[1:30:22] I'm not buying your reinterpretation to
[1:30:25] what my God said. My God's word will
[1:30:27] stand. It'll never change. It's true.
[1:30:30] It's yay and amen. I'll keep confessing
[1:30:32] it. And I want you to know it doesn't
[1:30:34] matter what it looks like. It doesn't
[1:30:36] matter what it don't look like. It don't
[1:30:37] even matter how I feel. It don't matter
[1:30:39] if it doesn't make sense. God said he'll
[1:30:41] give you your children. God said he'll
[1:30:43] give you your lost loved ones. God said
[1:30:44] prodals will come back to you. God said
[1:30:46] he's going to heal your body. God said
[1:30:48] he's going to deliver you of that thing
[1:30:49] that you can't give victory over. And
[1:30:51] you say, Satan says, you know, I don't
[1:30:53] know. You've been waiting on that so
[1:30:54] long. You know what faith says? Faith
[1:30:56] says it doesn't matter if I understand
[1:30:58] it. Doesn't matter if it doesn't make
[1:30:59] sense. Doesn't matter if all the
[1:31:01] evidence I have is against me. I'm going
[1:31:03] to let you know I'm not letting go of my
[1:31:06] promise. I'm taking a stand for the word
[1:31:08] of God. I'm a believer. And that's what
[1:31:11] believers do. They confess the promises
[1:31:13] of God.
[1:31:15] Hallelujah.
[1:31:17] There won't even be a hoof left behind.
[1:31:20] We're all going.
[1:31:23] Get it through your head, devil. We're
[1:31:25] all going in the rapture. None of our
[1:31:28] young people are going to get left
[1:31:29] behind. None of our family members, I
[1:31:32] don't care if they've left the message.
[1:31:33] I don't care if they've left your house.
[1:31:35] I don't care if they're not even here
[1:31:37] tonight. You claim them and say, "God,
[1:31:39] you put a promise in your word. And it
[1:31:41] doesn't matter what my circumstances
[1:31:43] look like. I'm going to confess the word
[1:31:45] of God. I'm going to believe the word of
[1:31:47] God. I'm going to keep knocking on your
[1:31:49] door until the doors answer and the
[1:31:52] doors open. I'm going to stay right here
[1:31:54] and take a stand for the word of God.
[1:31:59] I'm on your hands. I'm not going. Can
[1:32:02] you have this confession? Unless they
[1:32:05] can go, too.
[1:32:08] I believe a real mother will say amen to
[1:32:10] that.
[1:32:12] I'm not going unless they go too. That's
[1:32:15] what faith says. Oh, what a gallant
[1:32:17] servant. I want to take them with me
[1:32:19] just because I've got and I sit down and
[1:32:21] say, "Well, now this is all right." No,
[1:32:23] sir. We want the people, too. Every one
[1:32:26] of us is going. He said we ain't going
[1:32:29] to leave even we have not even He says
[1:32:31] he says we ain't going to even leave
[1:32:33] every sheep or anything behind. There's
[1:32:36] not going to be a hoof left back. We're
[1:32:39] all going in the promised land.
[1:32:43] He says every one of us, whether you're
[1:32:45] a housewife, whether you're a little
[1:32:47] maid, whether you're an old woman or a
[1:32:49] young man, an old man, whatever you are,
[1:32:52] we're going anyhow. There's not going to
[1:32:54] be one of us left. Amen. Every one of us
[1:32:56] is going and we ain't going to stop it.
[1:32:58] Nothing else. You know, finally Pharaoh
[1:33:01] said, "Get out. Just get out." Moses,
[1:33:04] this is what the This is what the
[1:33:06] confession of the word of God finally
[1:33:07] does to the devil. He finally just says,
[1:33:09] "Fine. You can have it. Just get out of
[1:33:12] here. I don't want to hear your praising
[1:33:13] anymore. I don't want to hear your
[1:33:15] preaching anymore. I don't want to hear
[1:33:16] your confession anymore. Just get out."
[1:33:22] God just plagued him with the voice of
[1:33:23] Moses. And I tell you what you can do.
[1:33:25] You can play a mother can plague the
[1:33:28] devil's mind by confessing the word of
[1:33:30] God. Your voice can become a torment to
[1:33:33] the demon spirit that afflicts you. I
[1:33:35] said your voice, not the preacher's
[1:33:37] voice, not God's prophet's voice, but
[1:33:40] your confession can torment the devil in
[1:33:42] your own life. I say tonight you ought
[1:33:44] to start confessing what the word of God
[1:33:46] says and cast everything else aside.
[1:33:54] He struck everything. He done everything
[1:33:55] there was to be done. He stopped. He put
[1:33:57] the sun down in the middle of the day.
[1:33:59] God just poured it all out. He done
[1:34:01] everything. He blackened the days. He
[1:34:02] brought frogs, fleas, lice, everything.
[1:34:04] Fire, smoke, death to his families and
[1:34:06] everything else. He done everything till
[1:34:08] finally Pharaoh had to say, "Get out.
[1:34:12] Take all you got and go. I believe one
[1:34:15] day the devil's gonna turn loose and
[1:34:18] he's just gonna say get out.
[1:34:23] Oh, brother Brandham says, "Oh my,
[1:34:24] praise be to God." I say, "Oh my, praise
[1:34:28] be to God. I'm so glad that a man can
[1:34:31] come so completely serve God. I'm so
[1:34:34] glad." Notice the next slide. I'm so
[1:34:37] glad that a man can so completely serve
[1:34:40] God till the devil don't know what to do
[1:34:43] with him.
[1:34:45] Just obeyed so completely till the devil
[1:34:48] said, "Oh my, get away. I don't want to
[1:34:52] hear it no more."
[1:34:54] That's right. You can do it so
[1:34:56] completely.
[1:34:58] So completely
[1:35:00] till the devil says just leave.
[1:35:06] Amen, somebody.
[1:35:09] You can live I love how brother Random
[1:35:11] says that you can live so close to God
[1:35:14] the devil don't even can't even find
[1:35:16] you. You can live so deep in the Holy
[1:35:20] Spirit the devil can't even find you. I
[1:35:23] say God give me that kind of faith
[1:35:26] to where I live so close to God the
[1:35:29] devil can't even find me. But Lord let
[1:35:32] me say this also. Let my confession be
[1:35:35] so powerful to deny all of what's around
[1:35:39] me and every lying vanity Satan has put
[1:35:41] through me. Let my voice confess the
[1:35:44] word of God in so much that it haunts
[1:35:46] hell and torments the demon spirits in
[1:35:49] my life.
[1:35:50] Let me start confessing the word of God.
[1:35:53] As brother Brandham says, you can live
[1:35:54] so much that the devil don't even know
[1:35:56] what can and don't even know how to find
[1:35:58] you. As brother Brandham says, he speaks
[1:36:00] of the man the the other day and he says
[1:36:02] where the he says where a man, he said
[1:36:05] the devil got before him. I know you
[1:36:07] know this story, but I just love telling
[1:36:08] it. He said the devil got before him and
[1:36:11] he says and you know he said that little
[1:36:12] devil there was speaking to him and
[1:36:14] lying to him, whispering in his ear and
[1:36:16] he says I watched him. He says he was
[1:36:18] just so small and he says and every time
[1:36:22] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:36:23] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:36:23] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:36:23] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:36:23] brother brother Brandham just tells the
[1:36:24] story. He said, he said he was just a
[1:36:26] little bitty little bitty uh uh devil
[1:36:28] and he said, "Boo."
[1:36:33] And the man said, "I sort of got scared,
[1:36:36] you know."
[1:36:38] He sort of like, "You get close to
[1:36:39] something and you you just jump back."
[1:36:42] Brother Brandon says, "That's what the
[1:36:43] man did." He said, "I just" He says,
[1:36:44] "You know, the man would go before him
[1:36:46] and he said he said, "Boo." And he said,
[1:36:47] "I jump back." And he said, "Boo." And I
[1:36:50] jump back again. And he said, "Boo." And
[1:36:52] he said, "And I jump back again." And
[1:36:54] the man said, "You know what I
[1:36:55] realized?" He said, "I realized every
[1:36:57] time I he would say boo and I would jump
[1:36:59] back," he says he'd get bigger and
[1:37:02] bigger and bigger and bigger. Now, this
[1:37:04] is real. This isn't fictitious. This
[1:37:06] isn't Disney World.
[1:37:08] This is a real demon spirit.
[1:37:10] And every time you back up and run from
[1:37:12] him, that same doubt and fear just gets
[1:37:15] bigger and bigger and bigger to where it
[1:37:18] seems completely overwhelming to you.
[1:37:20] Brother Brandon says he said every time
[1:37:21] I jump back he'd holler boo and I jump
[1:37:23] back he'd get bigger and I'd get
[1:37:25] littleer
[1:37:27] and I'd get smaller.
[1:37:30] Boo. And I jump back. And he said every
[1:37:33] time the devil would get bigger. And he
[1:37:35] says and he says and I'd get littleer.
[1:37:37] And he said he kept saying boo. Said I
[1:37:39] get smaller each time when I jump back
[1:37:41] and he'd get bigger. He said you know
[1:37:43] what I know I had to fight him. After a
[1:37:46] while, I said I looked around, thought,
[1:37:48] "What? I found the word of God." Said,
[1:37:51] "I I I rolled it in my hand and the
[1:37:53] devil said boo." And I said, "Boo back
[1:37:59] and said, when I said boo back, every
[1:38:02] time I said boo," he got smaller and I
[1:38:04] got bigger. That's it. You've got to
[1:38:06] fight him sooner or later. You know, the
[1:38:08] people don't believe there's a devil. I
[1:38:10] run into him all the time. Uh-huh. Head
[1:38:12] to him every single day. And any of the
[1:38:13] believers, any other believer runs into
[1:38:15] the devil, whether you realize it or
[1:38:17] not, that cloud of doubt that tries to
[1:38:19] settle in over you is not you. It's a
[1:38:22] demon spirit trying to influence you.
[1:38:24] You've got to recognize that's not the
[1:38:27] Lord talking. That's the devil talking
[1:38:29] to you. And brother Brandham says, you
[1:38:31] what do you got to do? You've got to
[1:38:32] fight him.
[1:38:34] And he says, I I realize, he says,
[1:38:35] sooner or later. And he says, as a
[1:38:37] believer, you've got to fight him sooner
[1:38:39] or later. So, you might as well start
[1:38:41] right now. There's only one thing he's
[1:38:43] afraid of and it's that blood and that
[1:38:46] word and faith lay lays hold and it's
[1:38:49] strong and it marches on. I say today
[1:38:52] it's the blood that protects. It's the
[1:38:55] blood that defends. When the devil comes
[1:38:57] knocking on your door, plead the blood
[1:38:59] of Jesus and say, "My God was crucified
[1:39:02] for me. He was He He rose not just
[1:39:05] didn't he didn't just die for me. He
[1:39:07] rose for my freedom and I'm free tonight
[1:39:10] in Jesus. And I'm not going to confess
[1:39:13] the lies of the devil. How many here
[1:39:15] tonight would stand to your feet and
[1:39:16] say, "I'm standing for the word of God."
[1:39:19] I'm going to raise my hand up and say,
[1:39:20] "Boo devil." You come to me, "Boo devil.
[1:39:24] Got a problem here tonight. Attacking
[1:39:26] your family, attacking your home." Say,
[1:39:28] "Here's what faith says. Boo devil. I'm
[1:39:31] not going to back up. I'm not going to
[1:39:33] bow down. I'm not going to be a coward
[1:39:35] because I'm a soldier in the army of
[1:39:37] God.
[1:39:38] I'm a warrior
[1:39:41] and I've got battles to face and I'm not
[1:39:43] going to spend my time running from the
[1:39:46] enemy that's coming after me. You know
[1:39:49] what I'm going to do tonight? How many
[1:39:51] can raise a hand and say, "I'm choosing
[1:39:53] to fight."
[1:39:55] Hallelujah. Hands up everywhere. Say,
[1:39:57] "I'm choosing to fight the devil. I'm
[1:40:00] not going to accept his lies. I'm not
[1:40:03] going to let him rearrange. I'm not
[1:40:06] going to let him redefine what he's told
[1:40:08] me. If God's given you a promise, I say
[1:40:10] tonight, hold on to the promise of the
[1:40:11] word of God.
[1:40:13] I say tonight, lay hold on eternal life.
[1:40:16] That's why the Bible says the kingdom of
[1:40:18] heaven suffer violence and the violent
[1:40:20] take it.
[1:40:22] They take it
[1:40:24] by force.
[1:40:26] How am I going to get that promise of
[1:40:28] God to come to pass in my life, brother
[1:40:29] Matt? I promise you, we're never going
[1:40:31] to do it by confessing what the what the
[1:40:34] devil says.
[1:40:35] We're never going to do it by confessing
[1:40:37] our symptoms. We're going to do it one
[1:40:39] way by saying, "I choose to let my
[1:40:43] confession be what the word of God says
[1:40:47] until my body obeys my confession."
[1:40:52] Oh, raise your hands up with me
[1:40:53] together. Say, "Lord, I'm going to
[1:40:55] choose to confess your word. Amen.
[1:40:58] I'm going to choose to stop confessing
[1:41:00] what the what the devil says and I'm
[1:41:03] going to confess what the word of God
[1:41:04] has already said. I'm free in Jesus. I'm
[1:41:07] healed in Jesus' name. I'm delivered in
[1:41:10] Jesus' name. I'm not going to allow that
[1:41:13] thought to come in my mind. Oh, bow your
[1:41:15] heads with me and raise those hands and
[1:41:17] say, "Lord, I'm not going to allow it
[1:41:19] anymore. From this night forward,
[1:41:22] I'm not going to claim my anxiety. I'm
[1:41:24] not going to claim my depression. I'm
[1:41:26] not going to claim my diabetes. I'm not
[1:41:28] going to claim all my problems and all
[1:41:30] the hindrances and obstacles.
[1:41:32] I'm going to take the sword of the word
[1:41:34] of God with a strong and you say,
[1:41:36] "Brother Ma, Lord, I don't have a strong
[1:41:38] hand." Then say, "God, give me that
[1:41:40] strong hand of faith to take the sword
[1:41:43] of the word of God and cut the devil's
[1:41:45] head off."
[1:41:48] It's inside of you. It's inside of that
[1:41:51] seed. It's inside of the potential that
[1:41:53] was in the life of Christ. And all that
[1:41:56] Christ was, he poured it into his
[1:41:58] church.
[1:41:59] And it's inside of the seed of God here
[1:42:01] tonight. All you got to do is believe
[1:42:03] it. Oh, I raise my hand up with these
[1:42:05] people tonight, Lord, and I say, "I
[1:42:07] believe your word, oh God. I confess
[1:42:09] your word, Lord. I say what the word
[1:42:12] says." And if the word says I'm free,
[1:42:15] then I am free in Jesus. If the word
[1:42:18] says I'm healed by his stripes, then I
[1:42:21] say I'm healed in Jesus name.
[1:42:24] It doesn't matter what my symptoms say,
[1:42:26] I'm not going to use my tongue to allow
[1:42:28] the devil to get bigger in my life.
[1:42:31] When he says boo, I'm going to say boo
[1:42:33] back, devil. I'm going to say Jesus
[1:42:36] defeated you already at Calvary and
[1:42:38] you're just a defeated enemy. The only
[1:42:40] weapon you've got is trying to get me to
[1:42:42] doubt my weapon. But I'm going to
[1:42:45] confess my weapon, which is a sword of
[1:42:46] the word. You come against my family,
[1:42:49] Satan, I'm going to be standing here
[1:42:50] with the word of God to confront you.
[1:42:52] You come to my children. You can't have
[1:42:54] my son. I don't care how dark it looks.
[1:42:58] You can't have my daughter. I don't care
[1:42:59] what the circumstances look like. You
[1:43:02] can't have my uncle. You can't have my
[1:43:03] mother. You can't have my father.
[1:43:07] I don't care what it looks like. You
[1:43:09] can't have my baby. You can't have my
[1:43:11] health. You can't have my body. You
[1:43:13] can't have my home.
[1:43:15] That's right.
[1:43:16] Well, God,
[1:43:18] what God says, that's what's true.
[1:43:21] What you say is a lie. And I say, like
[1:43:24] Moses, I'm not leaving without my
[1:43:26] children. I'm not leaving without all of
[1:43:29] my promises. I'm not leaving with
[1:43:31] everything God has promised to me. I'm
[1:43:33] not going to be a coward if Satan's
[1:43:34] tried to make me a coward and and and
[1:43:36] and and try to water down my confession.
[1:43:39] And tonight, I'm going to take a bold
[1:43:41] stand for the word of God. I'm going to
[1:43:43] confess what the word says. Oh, how many
[1:43:46] can do it? How many can do it here
[1:43:48] tonight, Lord Jesus?
[1:43:51] We thank you, Lord.
[1:43:54] Thank you, God, that we have your word.
[1:43:57] And as your prophet said, that word will
[1:43:59] defeat the devil anytime, any place,
[1:44:01] anywhere, under any condition, under any
[1:44:04] circumstance, in any atmosphere, in any
[1:44:07] report. It doesn't matter. The word of
[1:44:09] God will defeat the devil anywhere, any
[1:44:11] t any place, anytime. Oh, you've been
[1:44:14] given the word, little bride. You've
[1:44:16] been given the sword of the word to cut
[1:44:17] the devil's head off. You've been given
[1:44:19] authority and power over any spirit that
[1:44:22] tries to rise up against you. I say
[1:44:24] today, don't don't settle. Don't settle.
[1:44:28] Don't let the devil sell you a lie and
[1:44:30] settle down where you're at. There's
[1:44:31] more ground to gain. There's more land
[1:44:34] to conquer. There's more promises for
[1:44:36] you yet. It's not over for you. It's
[1:44:40] just the beginning.
[1:44:43] I take a hold of that tonight. How many
[1:44:44] can take a hold of that and say, "It's
[1:44:47] not over. It's just the beginning.
[1:44:50] Little as much when God is in it.
[1:44:52] Doesn't matter what the circumstances
[1:44:54] look like. I'm going to confess the word
[1:44:56] of God tonight." What are you playing?
[1:44:59] Go ahead, brother Ken.
[1:45:04] overcome.
[1:45:08] Oh, can we raise our hands?
[1:45:11] Sing it one time through. We've been
[1:45:13] made.
[1:45:14] We've been made.
[1:45:15] Oh, victori.
[1:45:20] Hallelujah.
[1:45:21] Here's how. Through the blood of Jesus
[1:45:25] Christ.
[1:45:27] Could you gather now? We're going to
[1:45:29] take a prayer. We've been made
[1:45:33] more than coner
[1:45:36] [Music]
[1:45:39] over
[1:45:41] in this life.
[1:45:44] Oh,
[1:45:47] we've been made
[1:45:50] victorious
[1:45:51] [Music]
[1:45:53] through the blood through the blood of
[1:45:57] Jesus Christ.
[1:45:59] [Music]
[1:46:01] for my grandmother. Just keep playing
[1:46:03] that who's not here tonight. She called
[1:46:05] me before service to let me know she
[1:46:06] wouldn't be here. And uh she just wanted
[1:46:09] to say she's been having really bad back
[1:46:12] problems uh for a week now. And
[1:46:14] yesterday uh Katie took her to the to
[1:46:16] the doctor because it's been getting a
[1:46:18] lot worse. And he's given her a shot,
[1:46:20] but the shot hasn't really taken full
[1:46:22] effect yet. So we want to just be
[1:46:24] remembering my grandmother, Sister Jean.
[1:46:26] Amen. Who's streaming here tonight.
[1:46:28] We're going to pray for her. You believe
[1:46:30] the prayer of faith can heal the sick.
[1:46:32] Amen. It can touch the body. Uh prayer
[1:46:35] also for her sister Juel. Uh she's sick
[1:46:37] and having some med a medical test ran.
[1:46:39] We want to remember Amen. My great aunt
[1:46:42] Juel. Sister Sharon Short uh writes in,
[1:46:46] "Please pray for my cat for healing and
[1:46:48] his body from organ failure." God loves
[1:46:51] the beast. That's what David said. God
[1:46:53] loves the animals. We've watched God
[1:46:55] heal animals over and over. We can
[1:46:57] believe for sister Sharon's cat. Also,
[1:47:00] sister Elizabeth Johnson. Prayer request
[1:47:02] for our Christina. She had a seizure
[1:47:04] early this morning in her sleep. Brother
[1:47:06] Winston and I are standing on God's
[1:47:09] word. Amen. No weapon formed against her
[1:47:11] shall prosper. That's confessing what
[1:47:14] the word says. By his stripes she is
[1:47:17] healed. We ask that the st saints stand.
[1:47:20] How many saints we got here? They're
[1:47:22] watching. They're online. say, "I'm I'm
[1:47:24] going to stand with you, Sister
[1:47:25] Elizabeth, tonight." How many saints We
[1:47:27] were asking that the saints stand with
[1:47:29] us. She has a headache and she's
[1:47:30] nauseous now. We're going to pray for
[1:47:32] her. Lord Jesus, we believe your word.
[1:47:35] We're believers in it. We raise our
[1:47:36] hands, God, in a sign of surrender of
[1:47:39] everything, Lord, that we think,
[1:47:41] everything the devil tries to lie to us.
[1:47:43] And we say tonight, Lord God, your word
[1:47:45] is true. And the devil's word's a lie.
[1:47:48] God, we confess your word for my
[1:47:50] grandmother's healing in her back. God,
[1:47:52] I pray even now, Father, may you touch
[1:47:54] her, Lord Jesus. We pray and we bind our
[1:47:57] faith together for her body. Lord God,
[1:47:59] she's elderly and Lord, these kind of
[1:48:01] things Satan would try to bring upon her
[1:48:03] to bring torment in her life. But
[1:48:05] tonight, healing is for my grandmother
[1:48:07] and I confess it. I speak it in Jesus'
[1:48:10] name. Oh Lord, for for Jewel, my a great
[1:48:13] aunt Juel who's sick having some tests.
[1:48:16] Lord, you're the great physician. Lord,
[1:48:18] you have the answer before the doctor
[1:48:20] has the answer. God, I pray Lord, even
[1:48:22] right now, may you go to my great aunt
[1:48:24] Jewel, Lord Jesus, and bring healing in
[1:48:26] your wings for her. Bring answers, Lord
[1:48:28] God, to these symptoms that she's
[1:48:30] having. We ask it, Lord, as a church for
[1:48:32] this little cat, Lord, for from Sister
[1:48:35] Sharon. I pray, oh God, you can do the
[1:48:37] impossible. Lord, your prophet has
[1:48:39] watched had a little fish that was dead,
[1:48:42] completely dead, and and gave it back
[1:48:44] its life. And Lord, you told him the
[1:48:46] reason why is to show that you care
[1:48:48] about the little things. You care about
[1:48:50] the small things, Lord. And this isn't
[1:48:52] no small thing to my sister. I pray,
[1:48:54] God, you'd heal this little cat. Father,
[1:48:56] for Christina, Sister Elizabeth Johnson,
[1:48:58] Brother Winston's daughter. God, we
[1:49:01] believe in Jesus. We believe that you're
[1:49:03] still the same Jesus, the same
[1:49:05] yesterday, today, and forever. And
[1:49:08] Satan, you've came against and brought
[1:49:09] an attack on this little sister. But
[1:49:12] tonight, we confess the blood. We plead
[1:49:14] the blood of Jesus. By his stripes,
[1:49:18] Christina is healed. In Jesus' name, we
[1:49:21] ask for a miracle, Lord. A miraculous
[1:49:24] touch as we bind together by faith.
[1:49:27] Whatsoever you ask in faith, it shall be
[1:49:29] done. Whatsoever you bind on earth shall
[1:49:32] be bound in heaven. And we, Lord,
[1:49:34] tonight we bind this evil spirit, Lord,
[1:49:37] for all the hands that are up tonight,
[1:49:39] Lord, for an unspoken request. Maybe
[1:49:42] someone who didn't get a time to write
[1:49:43] it down. Lord, may you come and be
[1:49:45] Jehovah Gyra, our provider. Be Jehovah
[1:49:48] Rafa, our healer. Lord, bring healing in
[1:49:51] your wings, Lord, to every situation. We
[1:49:53] ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:49:56] Christ, we we pray. Hallelujah. You love
[1:50:00] the Lord tonight. We've been a little
[1:50:02] bit long. Um, so we'll be a little
[1:50:05] shorter on Sunday, maybe. See
[1:50:09] any testimonies? Will there be any
[1:50:11] tonight? We can just take one or two. uh
[1:50:13] give you just a chance. Any testimony?
[1:50:16] Somebody want to share something the
[1:50:17] Lord did for you? Amen. This week,
[1:50:20] nobody. That's all right. We've been
[1:50:22] made. Let's raise our hands. Sing it.
[1:50:26] Sing it like a real believer now.
[1:50:28] Overcomers.

[1:50:49] Jesus Christ.
