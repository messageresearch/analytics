[46:35] this story preached overseas years ago
[46:38] and uh the brother was preaching French
[46:40] and the guy was like 6 fo n the preacher
[46:42] 300 lb just a tower of a man and his
[46:46] interpreter his English interpreter was
[46:47] this little old guy about 5'4 and he had
[46:50] him like a ragile everywhere he went I
[46:53] thought man that looks like a wild ride
[46:55] man I'm I'm glad I'm not interpreted for
[46:57] that guy tonight so you don't have to
[46:59] worry about that I'm only 5'9 eight and
[47:01] a half but I got shoes on so who's
[47:03] counting uh Acts chapter 13 the Apostle
[47:06] Paul he comes here back to Antioch here
[47:09] um uh I believe he's with Silas and uh
[47:11] he gathers into a synagogue here in Acts
[47:13] chapter 13 and uh let's
[47:17] start the scripture says this after
[47:20] reading of the law and the prophets the
[47:23] rulers of the synagogue sent unto him
[47:25] saying ye men and brethren if you have
[47:27] any word of exhortation for the people
[47:29] say on then Paul stood up and beckoning
[47:32] with his hand said men of Israel and ye
[47:34] that fear God give audience the God of
[47:37] this people of Israel chose our fathers
[47:40] and exalted the people when they dwelt
[47:42] as strangers in the land of Egypt and
[47:44] with an high arm brought he them out of
[47:47] it and about the time of 40 years
[47:50] suffered he Their Manners in the
[47:52] wilderness that's a nice way say he put
[47:53] up with them being rude all the time he
[47:55] suffered their man suffered he Their
[47:57] Manners in the wilderness and when he
[47:59] had destroyed Seven Nations in the land
[48:01] of Canaan he divided their land to them
[48:04] by lot and after that he gave unto them
[48:07] judges about the space of 450 years
[48:11] until Samuel the prophet and afterward
[48:14] they desired a king and God gave unto
[48:16] them Saul the son of Kish a man of the
[48:19] tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40
[48:23] years and when he had removed him he
[48:25] raised up unto them David to be their
[48:28] King to whom also he gave testimony and
[48:31] said I have found David the son of Jesse
[48:35] a man after mine own heart which shall
[48:39] fulfill all my will that's quite a
[48:41] testimony
[48:43] amen notice verse 23 of this man's seed
[48:46] ha God according to his promise raised
[48:49] unto Israel a savior Jesus now just for
[48:53] the sake of time tonight he rehearses
[48:55] the ministry of Jesus to these men and
[48:57] stuff we'll go down here to verse
[48:59] 33 and the Apostle Paul makes this point
[49:01] God hath fulfilled the same these
[49:04] promises he fulfilled the same unto us
[49:06] their children in that he hath raised up
[49:08] Jesus again as it is also written in the
[49:11] second Psalm Thou Art my son this day
[49:15] have I begotten thee and as concerning
[49:19] that he raised him up from the dead now
[49:21] no more to return to corruption he said
[49:24] on this wise I will give you the sure
[49:26] for mercies of David may the Lord bless
[49:30] the reading of his word you may be
[49:31] seated tonight amen that's fine I'm used
[49:35] to this one anyway do I need to shut
[49:37] this one off are we good okay good
[49:39] praise the lord well anyway well yeah
[49:43] now I got the sound of thunder glory to
[49:45] God I sound like a preacher um I'd like
[49:48] to take for my thought tonight for a few
[49:49] moments here a covenant of sure mercies
[49:53] amen a covenant of sure mercies of
[49:55] course the apost sorry the prophet
[49:57] Isaiah this last scripture he's quoting
[49:59] the prophet Isaiah in the 55th chapter
[50:01] we'll come back to it here in just a
[50:02] little bit but uh we to to begin tonight
[50:05] we're looking at David of course he's a
[50:07] man after God's Own Heart and and God
[50:09] testifies to this and uh just want us to
[50:11] think for a few moments tonight on the
[50:12] life of David because David from the
[50:14] time he's a young man he's been anointed
[50:16] by the prophet Samuel to be the king of
[50:18] Israel and he's just a teenager a young
[50:20] man at the time and I think it's
[50:22] noteworthy to remember that David he
[50:24] does not inherit the throne immediately
[50:26] amen he's got this anointing over his
[50:29] life and by this anointing he's slayed a
[50:31] lion he slays a bear he slays a giant
[50:33] and yet he doesn't become king right
[50:35] away he doesn't become king in a year it
[50:36] actually some time passes from the time
[50:39] that he's anointed for this purpose to
[50:40] the time he comes into this position so
[50:43] we see him as a young man he gets a
[50:45] group of Gentile Warriors he gets this
[50:46] group of Warriors and he goes out and he
[50:48] fights Philistines amen and so he's got
[50:50] these men and they're going out and
[50:52] they're singing songs about David how
[50:53] Saul has killed his thousands and David
[50:56] has killed killed his 10 thousands and
[50:58] and we see that at the end of all this
[51:00] you know David has shown great kindness
[51:02] for Saul amen he's fought Saul's battles
[51:05] for him he's he's played music for Saul
[51:07] he's done all these things and he's been
[51:09] a friend to to Jonathan which is Saul's
[51:12] son so David's done all the every right
[51:14] thing and every kind thing he could for
[51:16] King Saul David's done every good thing
[51:18] amen and yet we find that Saul he repays
[51:21] his kindness by trying to take the life
[51:23] of David amen maybe you've worked with
[51:25] somebody like that before you know know
[51:26] somebody like that amen it seems like
[51:28] the nicer you are to some people the
[51:30] meaner they are to you can I get a
[51:31] witness tonight amen and what we find is
[51:34] that when Saul he's unable to kill David
[51:36] he throws javelins at him and everything
[51:38] else when he's unable to kill David on
[51:40] his own he gets a whole Army he gets a
[51:42] whole church he gets a whole group
[51:43] whatever it is and they're after David
[51:45] and David here's a young man he's been
[51:48] told he's going to be king he believes
[51:50] the promise and yet he finds himself
[51:53] farther away from the throne than he's
[51:54] ever been amen he's a fugitive he's
[51:56] living in the cave he's living on the
[51:58] Run amen and we we understand of course
[52:01] the Bible tells us that on more than one
[52:03] occasion David has an opportunity to
[52:05] even take the life of Saul amen but yet
[52:08] he he he looks at this and he refuses to
[52:11] do it he says who can touch the Lord's
[52:13] anointed and be blameless amen who can
[52:17] touch the Lord's anointed and be
[52:18] blameless now this is a I think a real
[52:20] good principle in David's life amen we
[52:22] see four different times the Bible tells
[52:24] us that he behaved himself why ly
[52:26] towards Saul amen and I think it's I
[52:29] think it's significant because we we
[52:31] recognize that you know David like I
[52:33] said for many nights for years he is uh
[52:36] laying under the stars he's a fugitive
[52:38] he's camping out and I wonder to myself
[52:40] sometimes how many how many nights did
[52:42] David lay there maybe the men are all
[52:43] asleep and he's just thinking to himself
[52:45] God has made a promise to me God has
[52:48] made a promise to you and I amen he's
[52:50] made promises over our lives and
[52:52] sometimes we don't see the Fulfillment
[52:54] immediately sometimes we wait a time and
[52:57] maybe we get discouraged amen sometimes
[52:59] you've got to encourage yourself like
[53:01] David did because you're looking at the
[53:03] promise you know God is true and yet
[53:06] your situation looks as far away from
[53:08] the materialization of what God said it
[53:10] could be amen you believe that God's A
[53:13] Healer and let you look at your body and
[53:14] you might be sicker tonight than you've
[53:16] ever been but God is still a Healer
[53:18] tonight amen amen you might be
[53:20] discouraged you might be going through
[53:22] something but let me testify God is
[53:24] still the same today amen
[53:27] he's he's looking at the situation he's
[53:28] done everything right amen it's one
[53:31] thing when you messed it up and there's
[53:33] plenty of people in that situation but
[53:35] David's done everything he's supposed to
[53:37] do he's honored this man he's submitted
[53:40] himself to God and he's even spared this
[53:43] man's life and yet he finds himself in
[53:46] this situation maybe wondering did I do
[53:48] the right thing should I have handle it
[53:50] differently amen but we understand when
[53:52] you when a man's ways please the Lord he
[53:55] makes even his enemy to be at peace with
[53:57] him the Bible says I was telling this
[54:00] story here just a little while ago but
[54:01] you know I had a I had a boss years ago
[54:03] maybe you've had a boss like this my my
[54:05] testimony is I I've had lots of bosses
[54:08] and most of them weren't that good at
[54:09] different jobs I worked in maybe maybe
[54:11] that's your story hope not but you know
[54:13] I've had I've had I had a guy one time
[54:15] he was the uh the shift supervisor in
[54:18] the shift I was working at and and he
[54:19] had a bone to pick with me he was he was
[54:21] trying to get me fired because his
[54:23] Department wasn't going the way that he
[54:24] wanted to go and he needed a scapegoat
[54:27] so I guess he picked me for whatever
[54:29] reason I must look like a must look like
[54:31] a troublemaker I don't know but he he he
[54:34] he tried to take me to the HR tried to
[54:36] get me fired tried to do all these
[54:37] things and and I thought about it and I
[54:39] prayed about it I said I could sit here
[54:41] and fuss with this guy and I could play
[54:43] the he said she said game with this but
[54:45] I looked at the guy that was in charge
[54:47] of hiring and firing I said listen my
[54:49] numbers I've got the best numbers on
[54:51] this ship that anybody's ever had now
[54:52] that's not just me bragging that's just
[54:53] me telling the truth amen I said I'll
[54:56] let my work speak for itself I man I'm
[54:58] not going to defend myself against this
[55:00] you put me in this position you let me
[55:02] stay here for a few weeks and if you
[55:04] don't like how my work looks you can
[55:05] fire me if you want amen and let me
[55:08] testify not only did I keep my job but
[55:10] that guy he ended up he he got into
[55:12] drugs he got in all kinds of problems he
[55:14] got moved he got demoted he eventually
[55:15] got fired amen and I'm saying this for a
[55:18] reason it's one thing if you and I fight
[55:20] our own battles amen we're going to get
[55:23] we're going to get a return on that
[55:24] equal to our own ability amen
[55:26] but the Bible tells us our God is a man
[55:28] of war and if you let God fight your
[55:31] battles if you let God handle the
[55:33] situation he can do a lot more than you
[55:35] and I can do tonight amen the Bible
[55:38] tells us David testifies of this in the
[55:40] 105th Psalm he's talking about uh he's
[55:43] talking about Abraham and Sarah when
[55:45] they wandered in the land of Canaan in
[55:47] the 14th verse of Psalm 105 the Bible
[55:49] says he speaking of God he suffered no
[55:52] man to do them wrong yay he reproved
[55:55] Kings for their sakes
[55:57] saying touch not my anointed and do my
[56:00] prophets no
[56:02] harm well we're just going to do this
[56:04] now hope that's all right amen praise
[56:06] the Lord do my what what what's
[56:08] interesting to me about that that story
[56:10] is talking about ailec he takes
[56:12] Abraham's wife we're familiar with the
[56:14] story and God speaks to that king and
[56:16] the night of dream says if you touch her
[56:18] you're nothing but a dead man so when
[56:21] he's talking about not touching my
[56:22] anointed he's not just talking about the
[56:25] prophet Abraham he's talking about the
[56:28] wife that's his Covenant partner that's
[56:30] his spouse you touch her you're coming
[56:33] against the anointed of
[56:35] God you touch her and you and your
[56:38] nation you're dead and this man says
[56:40] listen I I did in the Integrity of my
[56:42] heart I didn't know God says I know you
[56:44] didn't know that's why I haven't killed
[56:46] you yet but you go to that lion Prophet
[56:49] you go to that man and tell him to pray
[56:51] for you and I will spare your
[56:54] house now you think about this Abraham
[56:57] we would look at and say Abraham is in
[56:59] the wrong but God made a covenant with
[57:02] Abraham and when he made that Covenant
[57:04] with Abraham he didn't say If Abraham
[57:05] was good if Abraham did what I always
[57:08] like if he never disobeys me but God
[57:10] made an unconditional Covenant with
[57:12] Abraham if you get out of the promise
[57:15] you might lose your blessing but you'll
[57:16] never lose the promise you'll never lose
[57:18] your position in your seed I will bless
[57:22] all
[57:24] nations God said it God spoke it God's
[57:27] going to bring it to pass this is not
[57:29] like the Covenant that God makes with
[57:31] them at Mount Si 400 years later well if
[57:34] you do this I'll bless you and if you do
[57:36] this I'll curse you surely blessing all
[57:39] right all right what that means surely
[57:41] blessing I'll bless Abraham in other
[57:42] words if I'm going to bless one person
[57:45] on the face of the Earth surely it's
[57:47] going to be Abraham if I bless no one
[57:49] else tonight surely it's going to be the
[57:52] Seed of Abraham if there's one person
[57:54] tonight walking out of here with the in
[57:56] it's the Seed of Abraham if nobody else
[57:58] gets anything from God Abraham's seed
[58:01] will be blessed he blessed your coming
[58:03] in I believe he's going to bless your
[58:05] going out he blessed your Uprising he's
[58:08] going to bless your Downs
[58:09] setting
[58:11] amen so we look at this with David David
[58:14] understands because he's been anointed
[58:16] and this anointing is what has allowed
[58:18] him to conquer Giants to conquer lions
[58:22] and bears to overcome adversity and
[58:25] David recognizes is the same anointing
[58:27] in the life of Saul Now listen Saul was
[58:30] was not a good king that's about the
[58:33] easiest way to say it I guess amen amen
[58:36] I didn't have elections like we do now
[58:37] so I'm not you know we not getting into
[58:39] politics but he didn't do a very good
[58:40] job amen and this man when he fails
[58:43] listen it's it's in the power of David
[58:46] to take his life but he recognizes the
[58:48] same anointing that put me in this
[58:51] position that is declared I'm going to
[58:53] be a king is the same anointing over his
[58:55] life if God put him in there God will
[58:58] take him out I mean it's not your job or
[59:00] my job tonight to take people out or to
[59:03] put people in if you're anointed you
[59:05] respect the anointing of God you
[59:07] understand you don't touch God's
[59:09] anointed amen praise the Lord somebody
[59:12] so David never has to listen David
[59:15] doesn't have to lay a finger on Saul
[59:17] amen he doesn't have to destroy Saul
[59:19] because Saul destroys himself through
[59:23] his Disobedience that this is why he hat
[59:26] hat David amen David's not out for his
[59:28] throne Saul has already lost the kingdom
[59:32] he just won't recognize it the prophet
[59:35] Samuel had already told him it's rent
[59:36] from your hands even this day so Saul's
[59:40] just trying to cling to something that
[59:42] he forfeited but God had made a promise
[59:45] to David that he would take this Lent he
[59:47] would be the king he'd be a commander
[59:49] and a captain over God's inheritance
[59:51] amen now I'm saying all to make this
[59:53] point you know David he's uh he's he's
[59:56] he's grown accustom for most of his
[59:58] youth his adult life he's lived outside
[1:00:01] I we got any people like camping in here
[1:00:03] I'm
[1:00:07] sorry I tell people this my idea of
[1:00:09] camping is like a motel like that's
[1:00:11] that's as rough as I get amen yall want
[1:00:13] to sleep on the hard ground and have
[1:00:15] bugs or man what is wrong with you
[1:00:17] people now you say no you shouldn't be
[1:00:19] saying that I but I got scripture for it
[1:00:22] amen because David has lived much of his
[1:00:23] life wandering as a fugitive wandering
[1:00:26] in the wilderness doing all these things
[1:00:28] and the Bible tells us in 2 Samuel the
[1:00:30] 7th chapter after he becomes king he has
[1:00:34] rest from all of his enemies and the
[1:00:35] Bible tells it came to pass when the
[1:00:37] king sat in his house and the Lord had
[1:00:39] given him rest roundabout from all of
[1:00:42] his enemies that the king said unto
[1:00:44] Nathan the prophet see now I dwell in a
[1:00:47] house of
[1:00:47] Cedar and but the Ark of God dwell
[1:00:50] within curtains and Nathan said to the
[1:00:52] king go and do that is all that is in
[1:00:55] thine heart for the Lord is with thee
[1:00:57] and it came to pass that night that the
[1:00:58] word of the Lord came to Nathan saying
[1:01:00] go and tell my servant David thus say
[1:01:04] the Lord shalt thou build me an house
[1:01:07] for me to dwell in whereas I have not
[1:01:09] dwelt in any house since the time that I
[1:01:12] brought up the children of Israel out of
[1:01:13] Egypt even to this day but have walked
[1:01:16] in a tent and in a tabernacle notice
[1:01:19] verse 7 in all the places where I walked
[1:01:22] with all the children of Israel spake i
[1:01:25] a word with any of the tribes of Israel
[1:01:28] whom I command to Feed My People Israel
[1:01:30] saying why build ye me not in House of
[1:01:32] Cedar now therefore so shalt thou say
[1:01:36] unto my servant David thus sayi the Lord
[1:01:38] of hosts I took thee from the Sheep coat
[1:01:40] from following the Sheep to be ruler
[1:01:42] over my people over Israel and I was
[1:01:45] with thee withs soever thou wentest can
[1:01:47] I get a witness tonight amen I have cut
[1:01:50] off all thine enemies out of thy sight I
[1:01:52] have made thee a great name like unto
[1:01:54] the name of the great men that are in
[1:01:55] the Earth
[1:01:56] moreover I will appoint a place for My
[1:01:59] People Israel and will plant them that
[1:02:01] they may dwell in a place of their own
[1:02:03] and move no more in other words they've
[1:02:06] wandered but they're not going to wander
[1:02:08] anymore because it's better to have a
[1:02:09] home than to live in a tent amen listen
[1:02:13] we are sojourning now in Tabernacles but
[1:02:15] this is not as good as the one we're
[1:02:17] going to in other words I've had a tent
[1:02:20] but a house is better than a tent and
[1:02:22] all the KN cappers said
[1:02:24] amen unless you got an RV that's
[1:02:26] basically
[1:02:27] glorified house tent something anyway
[1:02:29] amen amen notice this and is since the
[1:02:33] time that I commanded judges to be over
[1:02:34] My People Israel and have caused thee to
[1:02:37] rest from all thine enemies also the
[1:02:39] Lord tell thee that he will make thee in
[1:02:41] house when thy days be fulfilled Thou
[1:02:43] shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set
[1:02:45] up thy seat after thee which shall
[1:02:47] proceed out of thy bows and I will
[1:02:50] establish his kingdom he shall build a
[1:02:52] house for my name and I will establish
[1:02:56] the Throne of his kingdom forever I will
[1:02:59] be his father and he shall be my son
[1:03:01] notice if you commit iniquity I will
[1:03:03] chasen him with the rod of men and with
[1:03:06] the stripes of the children of men but
[1:03:08] oh I like that amen but you know if if
[1:03:12] brother Aaron comes to me and says he
[1:03:13] wants to borrow my new van I said you
[1:03:15] know brother Aaron I've known you for a
[1:03:16] long time and I sure love you I respect
[1:03:18] you
[1:03:20] but right then you know he's not getting
[1:03:23] the
[1:03:24] keys right there but my Mercy shall not
[1:03:28] depart away from him as I took it from
[1:03:30] Saul which I put away before them and
[1:03:33] thy house and thy kingdom shall be
[1:03:35] established forever before thee let me
[1:03:37] unpack this for you for just a minute
[1:03:38] Amen in other words David says I've got
[1:03:40] a nice house I've I've wandered in tents
[1:03:43] for a long time and now I finally got a
[1:03:45] house and David testified the house was
[1:03:48] better than the tent why is did I get a
[1:03:50] house but God has to live in a tent God
[1:03:53] should have a house and God says listen
[1:03:55] I never asked for for a house I didn't
[1:03:56] say I wanted a house but guess what I
[1:03:59] want a house it was well that you want
[1:04:02] listen David I didn't tell you that
[1:04:03] Flesh and Blood did not reveal that to
[1:04:06] you nobody said God wants a house but
[1:04:09] you realize because listen God allowed
[1:04:11] him to wander and to be a vagabond so
[1:04:14] that there would be something in his
[1:04:16] heart God allows us many times to go
[1:04:19] through experiences we go through things
[1:04:22] we wonder lots of times like David why
[1:04:24] am I going through this but God is
[1:04:26] trying to Foster something in our heart
[1:04:29] that we would see the bigger
[1:04:31] picture David Gets a house he doesn't
[1:04:34] just say praise God I got a house but he
[1:04:37] looks at his own life and he looks at
[1:04:38] God and says if I like the house better
[1:04:41] than the tent then God must want a house
[1:04:44] and God said it's well that it's with
[1:04:46] you I want a house you won't build but
[1:04:48] your son will build it and listen I took
[1:04:50] my Mercy from Saul amen I took my Mercy
[1:04:53] from Saul but you're different
[1:04:55] am see God is doing something here he
[1:04:59] has not done since the time of Abraham
[1:05:03] amen we say what makes this man David
[1:05:05] what makes him a man after God's Own
[1:05:07] Heart we could talk about his worship we
[1:05:09] could talk about his obedience we could
[1:05:11] talk about his courage but there's one
[1:05:13] thing that puts him apart from everyone
[1:05:15] else in the Bible amen we read it in
[1:05:17] Acts chapter 13 this is a man after my
[1:05:20] own heart he will do all my will other
[1:05:25] there's something I want done and I'm
[1:05:28] going to allow a desire in David's heart
[1:05:31] I'm not going to have to ask him I'm not
[1:05:33] going to have to beg him will help me
[1:05:34] out somebody sometimes we got to wait
[1:05:37] God will have to push us through a pipe
[1:05:38] he'll tell us and he'll tell us and
[1:05:40] he'll tell us listen I've sat there and
[1:05:43] counseled people before don't think any
[1:05:45] of them here tonight and they say what
[1:05:47] do we do in this situation well the
[1:05:48] Bible says this well the message says
[1:05:50] this well yeah I know it says that but I
[1:05:52] need to pray about
[1:05:53] it help me out somebody
[1:05:56] well I don't know I know it says that
[1:05:57] but oh no you're missing the point amen
[1:05:59] if God said it we believe it that
[1:06:02] settles
[1:06:04] it God shouldn't have to beg and brow be
[1:06:07] us into it and here's a man God doesn't
[1:06:10] even ask him but his least desire it's a
[1:06:14] commandment from almighty God what was
[1:06:17] David's desire what separates him he
[1:06:20] said there's one
[1:06:22] thing what was his desire amen there's
[1:06:24] one thing I've Des ired that will I seek
[1:06:27] after that I may dwell in the house of
[1:06:30] the Lord all the days of my life to
[1:06:33] behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire
[1:06:36] in his Temple his desire was a house for
[1:06:40] God and that desire is so great that God
[1:06:44] says I'm going to make a covenant with
[1:06:45] you amen and listen if your children
[1:06:49] disobey if they fail me I'll chasen them
[1:06:52] I'll correct them but unlike Saul my
[1:06:55] Mercy shall never depart from your
[1:06:58] family it shall never depart from your
[1:07:00] house your kingdom and your throne will
[1:07:04] be established forever amen so listen
[1:07:06] it's not every day God just makes a
[1:07:08] covenant it's not every day that God
[1:07:10] makes an unconditional Covenant but this
[1:07:12] desire was so great that God speaks to
[1:07:15] this this
[1:07:16] King and says your your kingdom your
[1:07:20] throne shall be established forever amen
[1:07:24] the prophet Isaiah calls it in Isaiah 55
[1:07:27] it's a covenant amen it's not just the
[1:07:29] sure mercies of David amen but he says
[1:07:31] this let me find it here he says incline
[1:07:33] your ear and come unto me hear and your
[1:07:36] soul shall live I'm so glad tonight that
[1:07:40] we've heard amen we've heard from our
[1:07:43] theophany amen we're not feeding tonight
[1:07:45] on the words of a man we're feeding
[1:07:48] tonight on the unfailing body word of
[1:07:50] the son of man if you've heard and
[1:07:52] you've recognized you hear and your soul
[1:07:55] shall live he says he says I will make
[1:07:58] an Everlasting Covenant with
[1:08:00] you even the sure mercies of
[1:08:06] David
[1:08:08] amen I want you to think about Solomon
[1:08:11] for just a moment here because Solomon
[1:08:13] you know we look at the Antiquities look
[1:08:14] at Josephus and these different ones and
[1:08:16] Solomon has the greatest most prosperous
[1:08:20] wealthy Kingdom that's ever been on the
[1:08:21] face of the Earth probably ever in
[1:08:22] history amen God blessed him with gold
[1:08:25] he blessed him with wealth he gave him a
[1:08:26] Discerning heart he gave him wisdom why
[1:08:29] does God bless Solomon this way to build
[1:08:31] the house that David want to build Amen
[1:08:35] in other words God blessed Solomon for
[1:08:37] David's
[1:08:39] sake amen because David had a desire and
[1:08:42] God made a promise he blessed Solomon
[1:08:44] amen you say maybe tonight well I've got
[1:08:46] a son I've got a daughter I've got a
[1:08:48] loved I've got a loved one somewhere
[1:08:49] amen I'm praying for him listen the same
[1:08:51] faith that saved Noah's house is the
[1:08:54] same faith that it not just saved him it
[1:08:56] saved his house amen
[1:09:00] that's in the tonight amen you're not
[1:09:03] powerless you don't have to ring your
[1:09:05] hands amen we know God is in the
[1:09:07] business of saving children he's in the
[1:09:10] the business of saving grandchildren
[1:09:11] amen when the day of Pentecost comes and
[1:09:14] the promise of the Holy Ghost is given
[1:09:16] who is it given to it's unto you it's to
[1:09:19] your children to those that are far off
[1:09:22] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:09:25] call
[1:09:27] amen God tonight his his hand is not
[1:09:30] waxed short that it cannot save you say
[1:09:32] well there in this situation they're in
[1:09:34] that situation look what the kings of
[1:09:36] Judah got themselves into they had some
[1:09:38] good Kings they had a bunch of wicked
[1:09:41] Kings what's amazing to me about this
[1:09:44] you know the prophet Isaiah he talks
[1:09:45] about these sure mercies we see this in
[1:09:47] 2 Kings the 18th chapter amen when uh
[1:09:50] sen uh Senate cherub the king of Assyria
[1:09:53] he comes up against the cities of Judah
[1:09:55] he eventually comes to Jerusalem and the
[1:09:58] prophet Isaiah he goes to Hezekiah and
[1:10:00] he's told to prophesy to him now
[1:10:02] Hezekiah of course this is I think 400
[1:10:04] years almost after the time of David
[1:10:06] amen Isaiah says this when when the city
[1:10:09] of Jerusalem is under siege he
[1:10:11] prophesies and he says for out of
[1:10:12] Jerusalem shall go forth a Remnant and
[1:10:15] they that escape out of Mount Zion the
[1:10:18] Zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this
[1:10:22] therefore thus sayith the Lord
[1:10:24] concerning the king of Assyria
[1:10:25] he shall not come into this
[1:10:27] city nor shoot an arrow there nor come
[1:10:31] before it with shields nor cast a bank
[1:10:33] against it by the way he came by the
[1:10:36] same shall he return He shall not come
[1:10:39] into this city sayith the
[1:10:41] Lord you say the devil's come against me
[1:10:44] I'm under a greater attack than I've
[1:10:45] ever been listen if I were you I'd
[1:10:48] declare war I'd let the devil know not
[1:10:50] only you're not coming to my house
[1:10:52] you're not coming on my property you're
[1:10:54] not coming near my children you'll not
[1:10:56] put one bankman up you'll not raise one
[1:10:58] spear you're not coming anywhere near me
[1:11:00] amen listen the Bible says he's going
[1:11:02] about ton not like a roaring lion
[1:11:04] seeking whom he can devour you know what
[1:11:07] that means he can't devour everybody if
[1:11:09] he's got to pick somebody that he can
[1:11:10] amen so if I were you tonight I'd make
[1:11:12] yourself a hard target make yourself the
[1:11:15] one with your token over your house with
[1:11:17] your sword drawn he can go by everybody
[1:11:19] else's house but when he gets to you
[1:11:20] says you know what I ain't going there
[1:11:22] tonight I mean it's too much work it's
[1:11:24] too much of a headache every time I go
[1:11:26] by that believer's house I get whipped
[1:11:28] amen I would let them know listen you
[1:11:30] can bother anybody you want but you're
[1:11:32] not coming anywhere near me I've got a
[1:11:35] word from the Lord I've got a token amen
[1:11:37] I've been told by a prophet of God that
[1:11:39] you can walk so close to God till the
[1:11:42] devil don't know what to do with you and
[1:11:45] we sit here and ring our hands well the
[1:11:47] devil this and the devil that and what
[1:11:48] are we going to do and life so hard
[1:11:50] listen if I were you I'd get into Christ
[1:11:53] I'd walk so close to God till the the
[1:11:55] devil don't know what to do with
[1:11:59] you the Bible said Jesus said you'll
[1:12:01] tread on I give you power to tread on
[1:12:03] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[1:12:06] power of the enemy and
[1:12:08] nothing nothing shall by any means hurt
[1:12:11] you and we act like everything's going
[1:12:14] to hurt us the government's going to
[1:12:15] hurt us and disease is going to hurt us
[1:12:17] and the econom is going to hurt us and
[1:12:19] church people are going to hurt us
[1:12:20] listen nothing shall by any means hurt
[1:12:23] you and I tonight if fold our position
[1:12:26] in Christ Jesus that doesn't mean you're
[1:12:29] not going to have trouble what it means
[1:12:30] is a thousand might fall your side
[1:12:33] 10,000 might fall at your right hand but
[1:12:35] it's not going to come n
[1:12:38] me notice Isaiah says God is speaking he
[1:12:42] says for I will defend this city to save
[1:12:45] it for my own sake and for my servant
[1:12:48] David's
[1:12:52] sake I love this because again in Second
[1:12:54] Kings the same story 20th chapter
[1:12:56] Hezekiah Falls sick amen in those days
[1:12:59] he was sick under death and the prophet
[1:13:01] Isaiah he goes up there and he tells him
[1:13:03] listen set your house in order you're
[1:13:05] fixing to die and Isaiah walks out and
[1:13:09] Hezekiah turns towards the wall and he
[1:13:11] begins to pray said God I've been
[1:13:13] faithful I've tried to follow you in
[1:13:15] truth I've walked notice how he's
[1:13:17] pleading his own righteousness and I've
[1:13:18] walked before you a perfect heart I've
[1:13:20] done the right thing Lord would you
[1:13:22] spare me and the Bible says he begin to
[1:13:25] to weep sore and the prophet Isaiah he's
[1:13:27] delivered his prophecy he had nice
[1:13:29] midweek service he's already walking out
[1:13:31] well things are good and God says go
[1:13:33] back are you kidding me I just got out
[1:13:37] of there I'm going to look like I don't
[1:13:39] know what I'm talking about go right
[1:13:40] back in there and tell them thus sayi
[1:13:42] the Lord I've seen your tears I've heard
[1:13:45] your prayers so thus sayi the Lord I'm
[1:13:47] going to spare your life I'm going to
[1:13:49] add 15 years to your life and I will
[1:13:52] deliver this city out of the hand of the
[1:13:54] king of assy
[1:13:55] I will defend this city I'm going to
[1:13:58] spare your life for my sake and for my
[1:14:02] servant David's sake
[1:14:04] Hallelujah God I did all this I did this
[1:14:07] I prayed I did all that's fine I'll do
[1:14:08] it for David that's a little humbling is
[1:14:11] it you're sitting there pleading with
[1:14:13] God look at me Lord I've done all the
[1:14:15] right things God don't you see me yeah
[1:14:18] I'll do it for David's
[1:14:22] sake well glory to God
[1:14:25] and what's interesting now this is why
[1:14:27] this is interesting to me I I I looked
[1:14:28] at this here a while back we notice that
[1:14:30] 15 years later when Hezekiah dies his
[1:14:34] eight-year-old son Manassa inhs the
[1:14:37] throne what that means is seven years
[1:14:41] before manasse was born amen David or
[1:14:44] Hezekiah was supposed to die but God
[1:14:47] looked at Hezekiah and said no I've made
[1:14:48] a promise to David and because I made a
[1:14:51] promise to David I will not allow this
[1:14:53] man to die without an air and manasse we
[1:14:56] look at his life listen he spends much
[1:14:58] of his life in Disobedience he does
[1:15:00] wrong things but God allows him to go
[1:15:03] into captivity well praise the Lord
[1:15:05] maybe you got somebody there tonight in
[1:15:06] your own family God allows him to go
[1:15:08] into captivity and when he's in
[1:15:10] captivity the Bible said he called out
[1:15:12] to the Lord and He greatly humbled
[1:15:15] himself and God delivers him brings him
[1:15:18] back to Jerusalem and when he ends his
[1:15:20] life he's humble before the Lord for
[1:15:23] David's sake
[1:15:25] he spares Jerusalem for David's
[1:15:28] sake he spares Hezekiah for David's sake
[1:15:31] you say what's this got to do with me
[1:15:32] I'm not a child of David like that what
[1:15:34] I want you to see tonight is David had a
[1:15:36] desire and one man's desire for God one
[1:15:41] man's desire for a house for the Lord
[1:15:44] changed the fate of his family it sh
[1:15:47] shaped the direction of an entire
[1:15:49] Kingdom it saved Offspring hundreds of
[1:15:53] years later Offspring David knew never
[1:15:56] even knew he was going to
[1:15:59] have one man's
[1:16:04] desire
[1:16:05] amen we go back to this Temple that
[1:16:08] we're talking about a few moments ago I
[1:16:09] want to visit this because I want to I
[1:16:11] want to show you the extent of this
[1:16:13] Mercy because when Solomon dedicates
[1:16:16] this Temple amen he begins to speak
[1:16:18] about how God had seen this desire in
[1:16:21] David's heart he says and it was well
[1:16:23] God said it was well with David that it
[1:16:25] was in his heart that was the right
[1:16:26] thing David I didn't tell you you you
[1:16:29] your parents in here you ever see your
[1:16:30] kids do you know how it is when they're
[1:16:32] little and they do something wrong and
[1:16:33] you're like tell them you're sorry okay
[1:16:35] I'm sorry well listen if you're 18 years
[1:16:38] old and I have to tell you to say sorry
[1:16:40] it doesn't mean anything amen but when
[1:16:43] there's something in you that just wants
[1:16:44] to do it because it's the thing to do
[1:16:47] that's different and it was well in
[1:16:49] David's heart that he wanted to build
[1:16:51] this Temple amen and Solomon begins to
[1:16:54] pray he prays the glory of God comes
[1:16:57] down the temple so much that the
[1:16:59] ministers can't even stand and what I
[1:17:01] like about this is Solomon praed this
[1:17:04] dedication for this Temple now listen
[1:17:06] this Temple is just bricks and gold and
[1:17:09] all these things but Solon begins to
[1:17:12] pray and he says if your people are
[1:17:14] smitten before the enemy and they'll
[1:17:16] look toward this Temple and they will
[1:17:19] pray towards this Temple God will drive
[1:17:21] away the enemy if they find themselves
[1:17:24] under a pestilence if sickness comes and
[1:17:27] they'll turn towards this Temple now
[1:17:29] listen what makes this Temple special
[1:17:31] David wanted to build it David had mercy
[1:17:34] now the mercy is going to be in this
[1:17:36] Temple amen it's no longer just in David
[1:17:40] it's no longer just in his family but
[1:17:42] this Temple is going to embody these
[1:17:44] mercies if you're sick and you turn
[1:17:46] towards this Temple and you pray God
[1:17:49] will turn away the pestilence if they
[1:17:51] find themselves captive in another land
[1:17:54] and they turn toward this Temple and
[1:17:56] they pray God will set the captive
[1:18:00] free amen so salon's praying if people
[1:18:04] will look towards this Temple that David
[1:18:06] want to built for God they'll look there
[1:18:09] and pray the god of that Temple cuz
[1:18:11] that's where God's going to put his name
[1:18:13] if they'll look towards that place God
[1:18:15] will give them Mercy as
[1:18:17] well we see this in the time of Daniel
[1:18:20] when Daniel's in captivity and the
[1:18:22] decree goes out not for them not to pray
[1:18:25] to anybody you can only pray to the king
[1:18:27] what does Daniel do he goes up into his
[1:18:29] house he opens his shutters he looks
[1:18:32] toward Jerusalem the Bible says because
[1:18:34] he's a captive in a foreign land he
[1:18:37] looks toward Jerusalem and he begins to
[1:18:40] pray as he's always done and what's
[1:18:42] amazing to me about that there isn't
[1:18:44] actually a temple even there at this
[1:18:46] point it's literally just rocks on the
[1:18:48] ground it hasn't been rebelled but there
[1:18:50] was so much Mercy in the rubble of the
[1:18:53] ruins of that Temple that God would take
[1:18:56] a prophet and deliver him out of the
[1:18:58] mouth of
[1:19:00] lions wow amen oh
[1:19:04] my God's rich in Mercy tonight see he
[1:19:07] doesn't just have mercy he's rich in
[1:19:09] Mercy amen if God's rich in a thing it
[1:19:12] must be a pretty big deal listen the
[1:19:15] prophet Jonah one day when he he was
[1:19:17] supposed to go to Nineveh he's going the
[1:19:19] wrong way he gets tossed over you know
[1:19:21] the story he's in the great fish the
[1:19:22] great fish that God had prepared when
[1:19:24] he's in there amen the Bible says he
[1:19:27] said I cried by reason of my Affliction
[1:19:30] unto the
[1:19:32] Lord well I'm preaching to somebody
[1:19:34] tonight and he heard me out of the belly
[1:19:38] of
[1:19:40] hell out of the belly of Hell cried I I
[1:19:44] love how brother Ram dramatized this
[1:19:46] because if anybody had bad symptoms amen
[1:19:49] everywhere this Prophet looks everywhere
[1:19:52] listen Jonah doesn't have one
[1:19:53] encouragement to look at in this place
[1:19:56] amen he's in the belly of hell but he
[1:19:58] says Thou heardest my voice thou had
[1:20:01] cast me into the deep in the midst of
[1:20:03] the Seas the floods compassed me above
[1:20:06] all thy Billows and thy waves passed
[1:20:09] over
[1:20:10] me he said I am cast out of thy sight
[1:20:15] yet I will look again toward thy Holy
[1:20:20] Temple listen he doesn't have a GPS he
[1:20:23] doesn't have a Google C I don't know how
[1:20:25] he knew where to pray but by faith he
[1:20:28] knew if I look towards this Temple that
[1:20:30] same promise that God had made to
[1:20:32] Solomon that same promise to David God
[1:20:35] will deliver me out of the very belly of
[1:20:40] hell so these
[1:20:42] men want you to think about this they
[1:20:45] didn't just pray but they knew the right
[1:20:47] place to look when they prayed see lots
[1:20:50] of people pray to a god of
[1:20:53] history or denominational idea or some
[1:20:57] false god I've been listen I I've gotten
[1:20:59] off at airports in foreign countries and
[1:21:02] you know them Arabs they're they're just
[1:21:03] as they're just as punctual as can be
[1:21:05] praying right at this certain time of
[1:21:06] the day and I'm thinking man I hope they
[1:21:07] don't see me get on the plane that was
[1:21:08] the time to get on the plane because
[1:21:10] they weren't
[1:21:11] looking lots of people pray to lots of
[1:21:14] things but these men prayed and when
[1:21:16] they prayed they knew where to
[1:21:18] look there's a God that made a promise
[1:21:22] to a man by the name of David
[1:21:25] and God kept his promise to his
[1:21:26] offspring God always keeps his promise
[1:21:30] amen you see what's that going to do
[1:21:32] with me amen because we know where to
[1:21:36] pray because remember we read at the
[1:21:38] beginning Christ has received the sure
[1:21:41] mercies of David amen so tonight I'm not
[1:21:44] telling you we need to go pray to
[1:21:45] Jerusalem at the end of service what I'm
[1:21:47] saying is what they had as a type we
[1:21:50] have the real fulfillment of Amen you've
[1:21:53] got something better than a natural
[1:21:55] house which can be destroyed by
[1:21:57] Babylonians which can be destroyed by
[1:21:59] other governments amen you have received
[1:22:01] the house that God built sacrifice and
[1:22:04] offering or not but a body has been
[1:22:07] prepared
[1:22:09] for not just Temple we are the Temple of
[1:22:13] the Holy Ghost we are the place the
[1:22:15] Bride of Jesus Christ is the place that
[1:22:18] God has put his
[1:22:21] name so we're not looking
[1:22:23] tonight towards a natural Temple you're
[1:22:26] praying to the god that's in
[1:22:29] you you believe that listen the word of
[1:22:33] faith says he's he's not up in heaven
[1:22:34] where you have to pull him down he's not
[1:22:36] underneath What's the Word of Faith say
[1:22:38] it's nigh thee it's in your mouth it's
[1:22:41] in your heart the word of faith Paul
[1:22:43] said that we
[1:22:46] preach God is as close tonight as you'll
[1:22:49] let him
[1:22:50] be you say God just seems so far away
[1:22:53] he's as close tonight you'll let him
[1:22:55] be amen cuz we're not looking towards
[1:22:58] the god of History we're not looking
[1:22:59] towards things we're looking to the
[1:23:01] place that he put his name we're looking
[1:23:03] to the door within the door amen you say
[1:23:08] well brother you
[1:23:09] don't people do this amen we we look at
[1:23:12] this idea of Mercy well I've made
[1:23:14] mistakes I've done this I've done that
[1:23:16] you know it's it's
[1:23:18] so for some people you know let me say
[1:23:20] it this way Christians have this unique
[1:23:23] ability that most of the world doesn't
[1:23:24] have it's called the ability to
[1:23:28] repent amen and what that means is you
[1:23:30] have the ability that most people don't
[1:23:32] have to consider that the reason you
[1:23:34] have problems is you started it amen for
[1:23:38] most people 90% or more of their trouble
[1:23:41] they caused
[1:23:43] it and what happens many times amen now
[1:23:46] maybe maybe this is not where you're at
[1:23:48] tonight but for me for lots of people
[1:23:50] we're our own biggest critic amen we can
[1:23:53] show Mercy to our neighbor we can show
[1:23:55] Mercy to the person at church but we
[1:23:56] can't even show it to ourselves amen you
[1:23:59] say it's for everybody else but me you
[1:24:00] know I talk I talk to a uh I talked to a
[1:24:02] Believer here a while back and they were
[1:24:03] going through things in their life going
[1:24:05] through certain situations I said do you
[1:24:07] believe that God loves this person do
[1:24:08] you believe that God loves so love the
[1:24:10] world yeah I believe all that but do you
[1:24:11] believe that God loves you that way well
[1:24:13] I don't
[1:24:14] know amen when it comes to us we're not
[1:24:17] quite sold out on the idea we're not so
[1:24:20] sure but these men were so sure in a
[1:24:23] natural Temple they turned towards it
[1:24:25] and they prayed amen we how I made
[1:24:28] mistakes amen well David made mistakes
[1:24:30] you know it's funny we like David makes
[1:24:32] like I don't know how many mistakes like
[1:24:34] he makes two or three big ones and
[1:24:35] that's what we always remember
[1:24:37] amen amen you know you you get among a
[1:24:39] congregation you know I've preached
[1:24:41] different places in over the years and
[1:24:43] it's funny you know you look at brother
[1:24:44] Brandon he's going up to preach uh to
[1:24:47] the Chicago Ministerial Association and
[1:24:50] they want to comment a question on the
[1:24:51] serpent seed and water baptism and on
[1:24:53] the message of Grace and I'm thinking I
[1:24:55] thought that's what we believe was Grace
[1:24:57] amen they're going to what's just funny
[1:24:59] to me because people take this message
[1:25:01] and it's just a bunch of rules and a
[1:25:03] bunch of legalism and those guys thought
[1:25:05] he was preaching too much
[1:25:06] grace well I don't know I mean you know
[1:25:09] I mean I'm just like well they you know
[1:25:11] they they you this message They Don't
[1:25:12] Preach Jesus enough well you not listen
[1:25:14] to the message that brother Brandon
[1:25:15] preached because he had a woman come to
[1:25:16] him one day and said listen I love your
[1:25:18] ministry I love what you're saying but
[1:25:20] there's one fault with your ministry
[1:25:21] well if you just got one that's fine I
[1:25:23] guess I'd love to hear well you preach
[1:25:25] Jesus too much you brag about him too
[1:25:28] much oh you couldn't do that brother
[1:25:29] Brandon said oh man I wish I could brag
[1:25:32] on him more amen why cuz he's the place
[1:25:34] of Mercy tonight amen people say ah I
[1:25:38] never heard nothing about it well you're
[1:25:39] not listening to what this Prophet
[1:25:41] preached because he preached Jesus he
[1:25:43] preached the message of Grace amen amen
[1:25:46] and you look at David we look about his
[1:25:48] life amen and you begin to preach Grace
[1:25:50] you begin to preach mercy and usually
[1:25:52] there's some legalist somewhere he pops
[1:25:53] his head up says well now listen you get
[1:25:55] to preach in Mercy and Grace like that
[1:25:57] and and people are just going to start
[1:25:58] sinning all the time and what's funny to
[1:26:01] me about that is David has received a
[1:26:04] covenant of sure
[1:26:06] mercies amen now he intellectually
[1:26:10] understands he's got sure mercies but
[1:26:12] one day he goes and he takes them H A
[1:26:15] Woman by the name of Bas Sheba 's wife
[1:26:17] and he commits adultery with her he has
[1:26:19] UAH killed he takes this woman to be his
[1:26:22] wife and after all this he tries to hide
[1:26:24] it and the prophet Nathan comes to him
[1:26:26] one day and he lets him he begins to
[1:26:27] tell the parable we familiar with the
[1:26:29] parable I can sit here go over it 20
[1:26:30] minutes if you want but but he goes over
[1:26:33] this parable about the man that took the
[1:26:35] one sheep the man that with many sheep
[1:26:36] he takes it and what does David say that
[1:26:39] man deserves to die not because he
[1:26:42] killed another human being but because
[1:26:44] he killed somebody else's animal he
[1:26:46] deserves to die and Nathan says listen
[1:26:49] you're the man you messed up you're the
[1:26:52] one that sinned against God Amen amen oh
[1:26:55] my probably the worst maybe the worst
[1:26:57] thing David ever did and here he's
[1:26:59] exposed and God said you did this
[1:27:01] secretly but I'm going to expose this
[1:27:03] openly because you've caused the enemies
[1:27:06] of God occasion to blasphemy against God
[1:27:10] and what does David do he says I have
[1:27:12] sinned against the Lord and the prophet
[1:27:15] Nathan he said something remarkable to
[1:27:17] me he says the Lord has also put away
[1:27:20] thy sin Thou shalt not die
[1:27:24] in other words before David even
[1:27:27] acknowledges his own sin his own failure
[1:27:30] the prophet said God already caused it
[1:27:33] to pass from you that's why David could
[1:27:36] turn around and now he can say by his
[1:27:39] experience blessed is the man to whom
[1:27:42] the Lord will not impute
[1:27:46] sin it's one thing to know you've got
[1:27:48] Mercy but at the lowest point of his
[1:27:51] life he recognized his sin was never
[1:27:53] even imputed to him and could rise up
[1:27:56] and testify blessed is the man to whom
[1:27:59] the Lord will not impute sin and what I
[1:28:01] love about that that doesn't cause David
[1:28:03] to sit there and go well listen I can do
[1:28:05] what I want I've done proved it I'll go
[1:28:07] send all I want he never does that
[1:28:12] again because when your desire is toward
[1:28:14] God and you receive Mercy I don't have
[1:28:17] to worry about you wanting to run around
[1:28:19] in sin amen you'll sin just as
[1:28:22] much I love I think brother Donnie said
[1:28:24] years ago you know I smoke as much as I
[1:28:25] want drink as much as I want cuz I don't
[1:28:29] want to and when David recognized the
[1:28:32] mercy of God it didn't cause him to go
[1:28:34] sin again it caused him to
[1:28:39] repent so this idea will you preach
[1:28:41] Mercy You Preach Grace people are going
[1:28:43] to go on sining not if they've got a
[1:28:45] heart like David's not if their desire
[1:28:47] is to do the will of God it will cause
[1:28:49] them to draw closer to God than they've
[1:28:52] ever been before
[1:28:57] I believe that's what this message is
[1:28:59] about I believe that's what the Capstone
[1:29:01] Ministry is about it's crying of Grace
[1:29:05] Grace when I recognize when you
[1:29:09] recognize it's no longer even imputed
[1:29:11] unto you that doesn't make you sit there
[1:29:13] and go I'll do whatever I want yeah what
[1:29:15] I want to
[1:29:16] do is dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:29:18] forever to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:29:23] to inquire in his
[1:29:26] Temple I just want to be where you
[1:29:29] are dwelling daily in your
[1:29:32] presence the mercy of God didn't cause
[1:29:35] David to drift away from God that Drew
[1:29:37] him
[1:29:41] closer Drew him closer than he'd ever
[1:29:43] been
[1:29:44] before blessed is the man amen God was
[1:29:48] not looking at David's inability his
[1:29:52] sin he was looking
[1:29:54] at his desire amen listen lots of
[1:29:58] Christians come to church all over
[1:30:00] America they're looking every Sunday for
[1:30:02] a visitation we're going to have a move
[1:30:04] of God we're going to have a visitation
[1:30:05] amen what we need tonight is not just a
[1:30:08] visitation what we need to is be a
[1:30:11] habitation amen he said he that believes
[1:30:14] in me if I if he hears me if I knock on
[1:30:16] the door if he'll hear and open I will
[1:30:19] come in and Su with him amen I'm not
[1:30:22] looking to visit him on weekends this is
[1:30:25] not this is not some partial custody
[1:30:27] amen I want him to dwell with me amen he
[1:30:31] say I don't have gold pillars I don't
[1:30:33] have a basin I don't have an arc but you
[1:30:35] know what you've got tonight you've got
[1:30:36] a little room about this size about the
[1:30:38] size of a button in your heart brother B
[1:30:40] said and there's a soul that goes in
[1:30:41] there and if you'll invite God into that
[1:30:43] soul and you'll give him that heart and
[1:30:45] you'll give him your strength and you'll
[1:30:47] give him your might and you'll give him
[1:30:48] your life he will inhabit every fiber of
[1:30:51] your being
[1:30:55] that's the house I want to give tonight
[1:30:56] take this house cuz I know what this
[1:30:59] house has been through I know what it
[1:31:00] used to look like and I'm not what I
[1:31:02] want to be tonight I'm not where I ought
[1:31:04] to be but I can stand here tonight by
[1:31:07] the mercy of God and thank God I'm not
[1:31:09] what I used to
[1:31:11] be who made the difference you didn't
[1:31:13] make the difference God made the
[1:31:15] difference and the same God that changed
[1:31:18] your life the same God that brought you
[1:31:20] out of sin he did not bring you this far
[1:31:23] to leave you
[1:31:27] Hallelujah I've been like I said I've
[1:31:28] been preaching for a few years now and I
[1:31:30] I mentioned this to somebody the other
[1:31:31] day I said I've got two
[1:31:33] followers I don't know how many bethl
[1:31:35] Tabernacles
[1:31:37] got I've got two
[1:31:39] followers goodness and
[1:31:42] mercy David said they followed me all
[1:31:45] the days of my life when I wasn't
[1:31:48] looking for God when I wasn't serving
[1:31:50] him when I wanted nothing to do with God
[1:31:53] yet his good
[1:31:54] and his Mercy they still followed me and
[1:31:58] if they followed me back there they'll
[1:32:00] follow you tonight he's not failed you
[1:32:03] he's not left you he will not forsake
[1:32:06] you you're the
[1:32:10] habitation amen Moses was faithful as a
[1:32:15] servant over the house of God but Christ
[1:32:18] is a son over his house whose house you
[1:32:22] are
[1:32:24] see you're not just servants
[1:32:27] tonight David was a servant you're Sons
[1:32:31] and Daughters Jesus said the servant
[1:32:33] doesn't abide in the house forever but
[1:32:36] Sons
[1:32:37] do we got some Sons here tonight Sons
[1:32:40] abide in the house forever therefore
[1:32:43] because they abide in the house forever
[1:32:45] therefore if the son makes you free you
[1:32:48] are free
[1:32:50] indeed God oh my
[1:32:54] that's why brother Bam could preach
[1:32:55] eternal security amen not the way the
[1:32:57] Baptists preach it not well I said a
[1:32:59] sinner's prayer or I put my name on the
[1:33:02] church Ledger I shook hands let me say
[1:33:04] it this way not even well I believe God
[1:33:06] sent a prophet I believe the message
[1:33:08] that's just being able to
[1:33:10] read you can sympathize with the message
[1:33:13] and do that amen but eternal security
[1:33:16] comes because you're sealed with the
[1:33:18] Holy Ghost amen that's why I believe in
[1:33:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:33:23] there's where your sure mercies are it's
[1:33:25] sure mercies you're sealed to the day of
[1:33:28] redemption and you are the Tabernacle of
[1:33:30] deity tonight you're the PowerHouse of
[1:33:33] God that's sure
[1:33:37] mercies oh
[1:33:40] my a desire want to be a
[1:33:44] habitation
[1:33:47] amen you know go back to David here for
[1:33:50] a
[1:33:51] second David
[1:33:54] he finds himself in this place he's
[1:33:57] sinned and he's he's he's displeased the
[1:34:01] Lord he's he's despised the Commandment
[1:34:03] of the Lord the scripture says and when
[1:34:05] Nathan confronts him about this and what
[1:34:07] he did he finds him in this place and he
[1:34:08] testifies of it in the Psalms where he
[1:34:11] lost the
[1:34:13] joy of his
[1:34:16] salvation I love brother BR over and
[1:34:18] over again he emphasizes this amen David
[1:34:21] never lost his salvation he just lost
[1:34:24] the joy of it
[1:34:26] amen you know I was talking to a brother
[1:34:28] years ago we were talking about say the
[1:34:30] joy of the Lord is your strength amen
[1:34:33] the joy of the Lord's your strength and
[1:34:34] this brother's like well listen
[1:34:38] the what is the kingdom says it's
[1:34:41] righteous peace and joy in the Holy
[1:34:43] Ghost the Bible doesn't contradict
[1:34:44] itself am mean the joy of the Lord is
[1:34:47] your strength amen that's why people get
[1:34:50] weak that's why why I can't pray like I
[1:34:52] used to I can't break through like I
[1:34:54] used to I just don't seem to enjoy the
[1:34:56] presence of the Lord like I used to it's
[1:34:58] not that I'm here tonight to condemn you
[1:34:59] it's not that you've lost your salvation
[1:35:01] you lose the joy of it amen listen when
[1:35:04] something gives you Joy like it did
[1:35:06] David that becomes your strength amen
[1:35:09] when you were in the world and you
[1:35:11] enjoyed going to concerts and you
[1:35:12] enjoyed smoking and you enjoyed drugs if
[1:35:15] you didn't have a dime in the
[1:35:17] bank amen you didn't have a dime in the
[1:35:20] bank you hadn't slept for 20 hours guess
[1:35:22] what you want to go bad enough you'll
[1:35:24] find a way to go you want to do
[1:35:27] something bad enough you'll find a way
[1:35:28] to do it amen and when you want to be in
[1:35:31] the presence of God when you want to
[1:35:33] Worship in the beauty of Holiness when
[1:35:34] you want to serve the Lord and that's
[1:35:36] your joy ain't nothing I can do ain't
[1:35:39] nothing the pastor nobody can stop
[1:35:42] you that's your joy that's your
[1:35:47] strength David loses the joy of
[1:35:51] it brother B makes this statement I
[1:35:54] think this is
[1:35:55] remarkable he makes this statement
[1:35:58] 1961 he says the holy spirit's here he
[1:36:01] said if You' Fallen weak lukewarm in
[1:36:04] your experience you'd like to be renewed
[1:36:05] Again David said restore to me the joy
[1:36:08] of my salvation he had not lost his
[1:36:11] salvation but he lost all the joy he
[1:36:14] says I think that goes to about 95% of
[1:36:17] the church
[1:36:19] today now I don't know if things have
[1:36:23] improved since
[1:36:26] 1961 my guess is from you Old-Timers the
[1:36:29] answer would probably be
[1:36:31] no
[1:36:33] amen The Joy they've lost the joy
[1:36:39] 95% probably talking at least one
[1:36:42] tonight that's 95% of the church today
[1:36:45] he said losing the joy of their
[1:36:47] salvation restore to me the joy of my
[1:36:51] salvation he said while the these people
[1:36:53] here are praying they begin praying
[1:36:55] would you like to come up get your joy
[1:36:57] restored the joy of your salvation that
[1:36:59] God might renew the blessings and your
[1:37:01] heart be full of his spirit and goodness
[1:37:03] come stand around the altar let's just
[1:37:05] come up renew our vows to God that's
[1:37:07] good he said sinner friend come with
[1:37:09] them backslider doesn't know God come
[1:37:11] with them sick or Afflicted come with
[1:37:13] them in other words whatever your
[1:37:15] situation is there's mercy here tonight
[1:37:20] it's not so much this altar it's the
[1:37:23] presence of God because he promised if
[1:37:25] two or three of us would gather together
[1:37:28] name he would be in our midst so there's
[1:37:30] mercy here
[1:37:34] tonight you look at Matthew 25 and we
[1:37:37] could go over this at Great length but
[1:37:39] there's people there's Nations that
[1:37:40] separated sheep and goats and there's a
[1:37:42] group of people they they gave drink to
[1:37:44] Jesus when he was thirsty they fed him
[1:37:46] when he was hungry they visited him when
[1:37:47] he was sick they came to him in prison
[1:37:48] when do we do these things as much as
[1:37:51] you did to the least of these
[1:37:54] am that's you and I
[1:37:56] tonight you did it unto
[1:37:59] me think about God he's he's
[1:38:03] so looking to show
[1:38:08] Mercy that one cup of cold water he will
[1:38:13] bless for his sake and for your
[1:38:17] sake if you give my disciple a cup of
[1:38:19] cold water in the name of a disciple so
[1:38:22] it's not just his sake it's like David
[1:38:24] it's your
[1:38:25] sake God so wants to show Mercy tonight
[1:38:30] and that's the
[1:38:32] unbeliever what about you and I
[1:38:36] tonight let us come boldly the scripture
[1:38:38] says unto the throne of grace that we

[1:47:26] going through those Bible characters
[1:47:28] talking about David talking about
[1:47:30] Abraham I thought to
[1:47:31] myself my goodness all through the Bible
[1:47:36] every time God's family would get in
[1:47:38] trouble even if they were
[1:47:41] culpable cuz that's generally what it is
[1:47:43] isn't it all right even if they had put
[1:47:46] their themselves in it God's mercy just
[1:47:48] kept coming again and again and again
[1:47:52] and again again and again are are you a
[1:47:54] witness of that can you say like David
[1:47:57] yes blessed is the man whom God will not
[1:48:00] impute unrighteous I thought about that
[1:48:03] I thought about God is always always
[1:48:06] from Genesis to
[1:48:08] Revelation many many times his family
[1:48:12] were sometimes put in necessary trials
[1:48:15] by the Lord but he always he's always
[1:48:17] merciful amen even times you know you
[1:48:20] say well wow some people you know not
[1:48:23] everybody fared fared so well well Hey
[1:48:26] listen even Moses refused to be called
[1:48:29] the son of Pharaoh's daughter and chose
[1:48:31] to suffer with the people and Paul said
[1:48:34] that there were some who received their
[1:48:36] dead to life but then others actually
[1:48:39] refused Deliverance because they were
[1:48:41] looking to something much better I just
[1:48:44] know this that wherever God is and
[1:48:46] wherever his family are and whatever the
[1:48:48] need is there's Mercy Hallelujah
[1:48:51] whatever has come between you and the
[1:48:52] Lord there's Mercy for you tonight amen
[1:48:55] you believe that tonight friends there's
[1:48:58] great Mercy I've always loved that
[1:49:00] brother Alex because where he says he
[1:49:02] did this for David's sake and then he
[1:49:05] did this for David's sake and I I just
[1:49:07] thought used to think to myself I
[1:49:09] remember being a as a teenager and I'd
[1:49:10] read that and I'd think my goodness
[1:49:13] David did way worse than I've ever done
[1:49:17] and I would sometimes I think there's no
[1:49:18] way he can have mercy on me than I think
[1:49:20] but wait a minute for David for David of
[1:49:23] all people for David's sake he would do
[1:49:25] this for David's sake he would do that I
[1:49:27] said oh he must love me too Hallelujah
