thoughts lord anything that would hinder the move of god lord we ask for forgiveness and we put we we confess it under that blood lord and lord we pray in this moment all you will see is your redeeming power and lord lift us up into the place where you are in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray the church say amen amen praise the lord if you have your bible let's go to um revelations the fourth chapter amen and i i covered your prayers familiar uh verse of scriptures you know revelation shouldn't be something that we are afraid to touch but revelation even the book of revelation you know it identifies who this bride is you know and satan the prophet of god said there's two books that the devil hates it's genesis and it's revelation one tells it's beginning one tells it's end so we um just want to dive into this let's just start reading that verse one revelation five verse 1 the bible says and i saw in the right hand of him that set on the throne a book written within on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open the to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david have prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof now you notice this work it was a complete work it wasn't just six seals it was seven and and the scripture says that this lamb he loosed all seven seals amen verse uh eight six and be hell and i beheld and low in the midst of the throne of the four beasts and in the midst of the eldest stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou art slain and has redeemed us to god by the by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation real quick let's go to ephesians chapter 4 ephesians ephesians chapter 4 um let's read verse verse 30. the bible says and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption amen may the lord bless reading of his word you can have your seats can you give me a bottle of water thank you amen praise the lord you know um uh by the grace of god i i i don't kind of i don't kind of want this to be a uh a service of doctrine or service of of of of i know this and you know that but what we want to deal with my my title tonight is a simultaneous work now when we when we look in the bible you know especially the book of revelations it clearly says that no one was worthy you know and john he wept and he wept over the condition of what what what the state of mind and everything was at this time that there was a book and the book was closed and it was sealed and there was no one to open the seals but then if we think about the seal and and and sometimes i think we make these things so complicated but when we look at a seal a seal it's something that's closed up so god when he came to loose the seals he was revealing something amen he was loosening something that had been closed for generations unto generation but what i want to say church in this in this revealing that god was doing there was two things that was happening hallelujah it was a simultaneous work hallelujah simultaneous that means it it's existing occurring or operating at the same time amen think about that word simultaneous so what i want you to catch tonight as we're talking about the seals uh let's look at what god did now the bible says he loosed the seal but you know one thing i want you to understand when he loosed the seal he was sealing a seal at the same time hallelujah and you know when he loosed us and he set us free he also sealed us in him hallelujah so it was a simultaneous work being taken place in that very moment when we recognize what christ has done for us but let's look at it church listen what the bible what the prophet god says he says he says now this messenger of malachi 4 in revelations chapter 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation chapter 10 which are the revelations containing in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mysteries truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers so the ministry of malachi 4 is doing two things simultaneously it's turning our hearts back hallelujah turning our hearts back to the apostolic fathers hallelujah and it's revealing the mystery mystery truth that this message has brought forth to us amen so church when we look at the seal of jesus christ the seal of his life the seal over us what did god do for us amen let's look at it he says now after we get through the seventh seal then at the time of the sounding of the seven seal or the loosening see there was a loosening now when we say that god came and he loosed the seal what did he lose hallelujah what did he lose church he lose the work of redemption for us to be free to serve him hallelujah so we are loose to serve him but still that we could never be lost hallelujah so simultaneously we're loosed but we're sealed amen if you're catching what i'm saying i hope you catch it you know he said he said we're losing costs we know what a seal is is to lose the ministry to lose the seventh seal so as we're listening to the message of malachi 4 what is it doing it's loosening us from all of our bondage it's loosening us from every sickness it's loosening us from every depression everything that this world had us bonded up to this word came and it loosed us it broke the seal hallelujah that had us in bondage and at the same time while the seal was broke we were refilled in jesus christ hallelujah come on somebody he says then we'll see the right on the child he say is loosening a message something that sealed up hallelujah so when the message of the hour came it was a loosening of revelation but a ceiling of a bride glory oh my church we got something hallelujah that that that the world knows nothing about you know what the enemy does he tries to get us to major over minors and we argue about simple points but when god came he set us free from bondage hallelujah he loosed he lose you from your own self only to seal you again in him oh my it was a simultaneous work at the same time while you're receiving jesus christ through his blood in faith you're being sealed in jesus christ hallelujah through faith amen so you're being loosed hallelujah and you're being chilled at the same time glory to god you say brother jake you're being confusing hallelujah well let me say it like this church amen we all know what we were before we accepted jesus christ amen we were hallelujah bound to our own thoughts we were bound to the ways of the enemy so god had to come and take the book hallelujah no one was worthy to take the book if we go back hallelujah we go back in the old testament why do we have to be loosed amen because hallelujah under those old testaments amen our nature could never be loosed heard from sin they will offer sacrifice after sacrifice but we still go back to that same nature that same bondage hunger then jesus came gave his life what did he do he took the book and he loosed us the lamb giving his life when he gave his life he set us free hallelujah oh my and by setting us free he sealed us again hallelujah listen he said what was that separation to do what did the separation separate them from as soon as they received the separation they were free amen as soon as you receive jesus christ hallelujah in your life you're loosed holy and then you're sealed oh god i hope somebody catch it church hallelujah it's a simultaneous act holy at the same time you're denying satan you're receiving christ hallelujah all right think about it i heard they say one time in a picture or play the same person that that they drew to be jesus was the same person they drew to be jewless what a characteristic hallelujah so church it's amazing that people don't even realize that they've been loosed hallelujah and they're still living in bondage when god has sealed them to be free hallelujah so we have to understand what the lord has done for us in this day listen let's go back listen he says and what christ and what was christ separating from what did he separate us from he said the bible said he was wounded for our transgressions hallelujah when he loosed us hungry he loosed us from our transgressions oh my he said he was bruised for our iniquity he loosed us from knowing to do right and still do wrong hallelujah hurray see iniquities know to do right and still do wrong he said the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were separated from our diseases we were loosed from every disease through the acceptance of jesus christ so as we were loose we were sealed in him hallelujah that's why church it's it's it's it's a complete act hollywood you repent you're baptized and then you're sealed with the holy ghost oh my think about it as soon as you can repent hallelujah in that very same moment you can be sealed we are the ones who's holding things up holy it's simultaneously oh my he said separated from our sins separated from our weary separated from our iniquity and separated from our sins by the word which was christ was made flesh and dwelt among us the word became flesh and the flesh was broke that the blood cell was broken loose that the believer could be brought through the spray hallelujah of the blood from calvary hallelujah we will lose hallelujah through the death burial of jesus christ and at the same time we're sealed to the death burial of jesus christ oh my that excites me church listen he says seal what is a seal hallelujah what is a seal i may have showed y'all this before but this bottle of water is a seal got a seal on it you know when something is sealed it don't matter how hard you shake it ain't nothing gonna come out and you understand what the seal is look at it real good holy what god did when god came he loosed you and he seals you and no matter how hard you get shook whatever he put inside of you it's not going to come out holly because it's there until the day of your redemption no matter what the devil does no matter what the devil says when you are sealed you're sealed until you rap into eternal life hallelujah you can be thrown around hallelujah but then when god comes to get you the seal will remain hallelujah you may be a look hallelujah you may be a little beat up you may be a little beat up on the outside but that doesn't break the seal hallelujah hallelujah and what we do we get caught up hallelujah and how beat up we are house how the struggle is what we're going to do and everything none of that changes the sale who cares what it looks like as long as the seal is intact hallelujah and you know sometimes right now this bottle is cold even when you're cold the seal will remain holy and if i leave it outside in 90 90 degrees weather in the summertime even when it's hot earlier it looks like the bottle is changing forms that doesn't break the seal oh my it's at simultaneous work hallelujah but look he says what is a seal what is a seal a seal first figures shows is a work that has been completed oh my now let's go into revelations when this lamb came and he broke the seals what were he saying when he took the book when he took the book we know that book represents redemption hallelujah so when he took the book he was telling the whole world the work over your life is finished hallelujah whatever you are supposed to be according to god it is finished hallelujah he don't have to add nothing to you you have to take nothing from you everything you are is wrapped up in that shield hallelujah he said it shows a work that has been completed a completed work he says the next thing it shows is ownership hallelujah i wish one of y'all would come try to break my cell this belongs to me hallelujah and because it's mine i'm the only one who got the right to lose the seat wow i'm the only one that got the right to loose the seal christ is the only one that has the right over your life to lose hallelujah the dynamics of jesus christ in your life holy do you think about this church i'm gonna make a statement right now and it's gonna shake your boots don't you realize once you realize who you are satan knows he can't do anything with you hallelujah he said it shows ownership and the next thing it shows and this is the one i love he said the next thing it shows it shows security y'all see me just drop that bottle as long as i know the seal hasn't been broken i ain't worried about it and some of us drop the ball some of us fall short daily but if there's a seal over your life god is not worrying about it hallelujah just as fast as you fall down there's something simultaneously working in your life to pick you up hallelujah think about it like this hallelujah god will allow you to fall just so he can pick you up he works simultaneously like that holly at the same time while he was giving judgment in noah's day he was given grace in noah's day hallelujah a simultaneous work hallelujah why somehow you were receiving judgment others were receiving grace in the very same moment think about it so don't just get one track in your mind to only say god can do this in my life don't you realize every step joseph made that looked like a trial was a step of victory now i'm going to shake your boots again you know when joseph was sold into slavery that was a victory oh he said brothers how can you say that holy because his life was a type of christ earlier being sold for 30 pieces of silver here just like christ was sold for 30 pieces of silver or whatever the account was he was in his trial here he was a type of christ what are you typing in your trial [Music] look at how many people go through things daily and we can't even see that it's christ in the midst of it first thing we say is oh the devil no it's a simultaneous work holy if i could make it even more clearer the prophet of god said amen for us hallelujah to receive healing hallelujah something must be sick holly so sickness is there so that healing can work simon sickness is there just so healing can work at the same time praise god oh my why do we have sad days just so god can show us happy days why do we have bondage just so god can simultaneously bring us deliverance church the negative and positive are always coexisting together right now in this room we have light in here because we have a negative and a positive working together glory adios so church i look at things a little different now when i realize what god has done when he came nobody was worthy to lose the seals thereof and when he came and he took the book he loosed the seals what did he do he set us free hallelujah he put us back in his hand what did he do he released his nature over our lives because remember here the one who took the book when you read it he said and it was it was a lamb as though it had been slain hallelujah so what was it taking that life what took your life back it was blood wow it was the blood of jesus that loosed you and set you free it was the blood of jesus that seals you to the day of your redemption because the life is where in the blood hallelujah glory and i know we've heard these things hallelujah before but i want you to catch something amen he says and the next thing it shows is security holy keeping it hallelujah see if god ever does anything in your life he can never take it back at least i was gonna get two amens out of that we serve a god who can't backtrack holy we serve a god hallelujah that can't even rethink what he's already thought but that's heavy ain't it he can't even rethink what he's already thought his first thought about you is perfect oh my the first act hallelujah of introducing himself to you is perfect hallelujah he can't come back and reintroduce himself highly the first way he does it hallelujah is the right way it's a place of security knowing god is a place of security think about the church we should wake up every day and enter into his rest because it ain't us doing it hallelujah it ain't us making it happen what is it hallelujah it's that lamb that loosed the seals over your life he loosed the seal and then he put a seal let's make it even more plain remember don't get nervous i'm about to close remember in in in in exodus when pharaoh and moses was going at it like two alpha males holy the only difference was one was a spiritual alpha male and one was a natural alpha male holly and moses moses said god said apply the blood over your doorpost and pharaoh's like i never heard of a god i'm god he's carrying on terrible did moses fret no he knew that that blood was a silly and he didn't have to stand there and wait he didn't have to guard the door close what guarded it from death it was the seal of the blood wow holly amen as long as they stayed behind the blood everybody was protected everybody look at the church everybody in that house so when you apply the blood to your house everybody is sealed everybody is protected honey everybody is comforted by their blood that you have applied oh my god what i want you to catch church it wasn't it wasn't just just just the the older the oldest one the oldest male that was being protected it was that whole house because you think about it you may have had two oldest children in that house but the blood protected each one that was in that house hallelujah and you know church as the deaf angel and i like to type it out like this as the deaf angel begin to go and go around everything hallelujah in the spiritual realm hallelujah it would either it would either it would either blend with death or it would meet an angel of life according to what was on the door and if blood was on the door hallelujah the deaf angel made an angel of life hallelujah and you know what the and the deaf angels will say give me passage let me come through hallelujah and the angel of life will say don't you see what's on the door holly i'm here to protect this house hallelujah it ain't you protecting yourself it's the blood of jesus hallelujah it's the revelation of jesus christ hallelujah it's that blood simultaneously hallelujah doing the work in your life in church in that moment holy that angel of life early standing there as the deaf angel is coming and he's saying let me through he said no this house belongs to god wow in church we have that same seal and no matter what you have done no matter how much satan accuses you amen the prophet of god saying god sees none of that all he sees is the seal of his own life [Music] that made me want to shout cause you know we spend so much time thinking about lord if i could do this lord if i could do that lord make me more like this lord maybe more like that and that's all right but just realize if you get there it ain't going to be your own efforts hallelujah it's going to be loosening hallelujah the loosening of that bondage the loosening of all that trouble hallelujah because remember earlier for god to even get to you he had to loose you first loose you from your worldly nature because as long as you had that seal over your life that seal of sin god couldn't even get close to you holly so that's why he died poured out his life and sealed you through the blood of the lamb and his blood changed our nature changed our thoughts change our desires huh see are you catching what a seal is see as long as it's sealed nothing can get in and nothing can get out oh god i'm falling short nothing can get in nothing can get out oh god my prayer life is not what it should be nothing can get in nothing can get out oh god i just went to the doctor and they said i got diabetes let me ask you a question are you sealed if you're sealed nothing can get in and nothing can get out you might even trip up sometime oh but when god finds you what does he find he finds that seal let's keep going i'm coming down listen we know the story of a box car now you got all kind of stuff in a box car traveling from state to state right they may say that's the safest way to to send some things cross-country but before it even before it even goes on this journey it's inspected and what you have to realize a lot of times when things are put in a box car it's not spacious it's very tight and jammed up in there it can even be a little uncomfortable for the thing that's traveling holiday sometimes it gets a little smashed sometimes it gets a little cut sometimes it gets a little damaged hallelujah but all that happens on the journey hallelujah before it can even go take off it has to be sealed and the inspector has to approve it hallelujah and what he does he goes and he inspects the boss car and he makes sure everything is in position where it's supposed to be and he's not he doesn't care holly his job is not to stop it every quarter of a mile and see if everything is in place that's not his job his job this is to be good now hallelujah before i close his job is to make sure you're fit for the journey hallelujah so when he seals you what is he saying hallelujah he's not worrying about the in-between hallelujah he has papers to meet you at the destination he's not worried about everything in the middle hallelujah he knows you here and he knows you over here hallelujah at this finish line holly and when he opens that box car hallelujah he expects to see hallelujah what he started with not something different hallelujah it doesn't take on another form hallelujah but he's expecting the same product he started off with think about that church god is expecting the same product he started off with he said brothers i was born in sin but let me say it like just before i was born and sinned holly i was birthed in the mind of god wow and every thought god had about me hallelujah was pure amen every thought god had about me was innocent hallelujah every god every thought god had about me was holy hallelujah every thought god had about me hallelujah was a supernatural thought every thought god had about me was victory and not defeat remember the bible says holy for he knows the thoughts he has concerning you thoughts of peace and not of evil so if you're receiving more evil harder than peace you're not tapping into god's mind holiday listen he says say for instance i used to work for a pennsylvania railroad i used to work with my father on the railroad we were we were load cars and we were put down here in this packing company we put in 10 cans now you know how thin a tin can is very thin but they packed them up hardly and sent them on a journey hallelujah he said and we set some up here and some down here and sum up this way hallelujah he says the holy ghost is the inspector hallelujah he shake you a little bit hallelujah and rattle you hallelujah because you think about those tin cans hallelujah they're making a sound while they're traveling hallelujah and they're just shaking and tingling and doing all these things hallelujah but the inspector's not worried about that what he's worried about is the position he placed him in wow hallelujah church and if we make it to heaven we'll make it there by our adoption by our spiritual position hallelujah you won't make it by your worldly material you won't make it by the knowledge of your mind holy you'll make it by accepting the position god originally ordained you for hallelujah oh my he says but says but now the seals listen to us are open the spirit of truth directs us to the word that explains why we all the mistakes has been down through the ages because the seals was not open hallelujah this was not revealed it's true holy so god had to come helluya and loose every seal why so we could walk in truth because luther he had a form of truth but not all truth wesley had a form of truth but not all truth pentecost had a form of truth but not all truth so in our day he came with a message hallelujah loosing the seals of your life why so we could walk in complete truth and it's only truth that will get us back to god hallelujah why because he says i am the truth i am the way i am the door i am the light hallelujah see church will loose to be sealed all over again oh my listen he says but oh brother when it was sprinkled that day when the blood of jesus christ a spirit of god written the seal from the top to the bottom and brought man back not only kept him away from the presence of god but he brought him back into the shekinah glory into the presence of god that he his his dead life when he offered his life the power of sin was broken because now man could be forgiven forever with a clear conscience oh yeah think about it church god had to lose us from the evil thoughts that we were born with so he had to come church he had to give his life holier pouring his nature into us sealing us to walk in divine truth hallelujah to walk by his divine nature so now we can do what the scripture says hallelujah seek on these things whatsoever is honest is pure whatsoever is of a good report the only way we can do that hallelujah is receiving the seal of the holy ghost oh my church one thing i want us to catch if you ever get the holy ghost you can never lose it are you gonna make mistakes yeah are you going to feel guilty yeah but you can never lose that seal because even jesus had thoughts that wasn't of god there you go amen yet without saying right honey he was tempted at all points all matters just like we was yet without sin church he was right in his position to loose us over all for decades to decades and in that moment of transition hallelujah a spirit came to him and say ask god to take this cup from you but a simultaneous work was occurring at the same time while the devil was trying to get him to deny it god was dealing with him saying accept it hallelujah accept this work that i've given to you hallelujah so in that very moment hallelujah god accepts her what he's supposed to do and he dies to death and he changes our lives forever never have to go back to being in bondage again why because we've been loosed and we've been set free but at the same time we've been sealed hallelujah and a seal a security a seal hallelujah a seal is is a complete work and a seal shows ownership so when i'm thinking when we're talking about the holy ghost and you're wondering if you're sealed holy you know the prophet god said hallelujah that this message of the hour holy has the power to change you holy transforming power hallelujah this word this message has the power to change you into what what god originally ordained you to be it's just as simple as that that's what the message of god is doing hallelujah it's bringing you back to your rightful predict position hardly simultaneously in safety oh my the only power satan has is what you give to him and some of y'all making him very powerful when god has already set you free when god deserves already we sing that song break every chain holy he's already broken every chain he's already loose you'll set you free harley then he comes back hallelujah he comes back and look what he did in in in a servant seal there's no particular angel or anybody talking in that seventh seal it considers to be a mystery hallelujah and you know and because it's not so direct it's a revelation people would look at it and they say the seventh seal laid open but he said he came to loose the seals thereof the seven seals thereof so he didn't just stop at six but you have to see where you are hallelujah listen now and i like to make it plain like this because we hear so much about this the first four seals what was it it was identifying the antichrist talk to me church you supposed to notice this stuff has been preached for 50 years hallelujah go ahead when we talk and and the preaching of the seals and the thunders and all these things is like the foundation of who we are so when we hear these revelations we are to say amen hallelujah and without god showing the prophet exactly where it was he would have said the wrong thing but because it wasn't a man loosening the seals hallelujah it was christ loosening his heels so he had to come and give brother branham his thoughts because brother branham couldn't lose it hallelujah he would have been saying the wrong thing he was looking at hallelujah the first horse rider and was about to say it was christ the church would have still been in bondage and throughout the years that's what men have preached earlier but then he said a message will come that will loose the people hallelujah church if we look at it right and i hope some of you message believers that maybe have left the message are watching because i want you to catch this the message didn't come to put us in bondage but it came to set us free hallelujah and when you get the seal which is the nature of christ hallelujah you don't mind dressing right right you don't mind acting right you don't mind doing the things you're supposed to do why because it's not you it's the nature of that seal hallelujah and the reason why some people could not live this message is because they don't have the nature of the seal hallelujah and they look at the message as bondage hallelujah when the message came to bring us out of bondage holy because the scripture clearly says hollywood that when this messenger comes revelations uh 18 and 4 i believe he says come out of her my people so what is what is this message doing when it's first being proclaimed is bringing forth a loosening and at the same time it's doing a loosening hallelujah it's doing a ceiling glory and for those of us that catch it we rejoice because we say i'm not the person i used to be i don't do the things i used to do what happens hallelujah you're loosed and then you're simultaneously sealed hardly glory that's what it does that's why the holy ghost is living the word for your day hallelujah that's the ceiling amen you living the message for your day the message for my day is not it's gonna rain although that's true that did happen in noah's day hallelujah that was a move of god holly you know the the the message for my day holy is not hardly a moses saying heart let my people go no the message for my day is taking on the character of christ and let it have full reign in your being amen church if i can say it in simpler terms what is it it is submission lord here i am do with me as you will that's how you know if you really got to seal holly because the only thing that controls the something's inside is me the only way i can come out is the one who got ownership lets it out the only way something can come in is the one who has ownership let's sit here as long as i have it it's secure harley everything hallelujah that belongs to me in this bottle is mine and all mine and nobody can do nothing about it if you try to take it out my hand will have to fight don't you know that's how god feel about you if satan tries to take you out of his hand he's up for a fight and you know what god has never been defeated church is not worried about the journey no as long as you leave with a seal god is okay [Music] there's nothing like taking a journey without a seal because it's just like a car being flipped and you don't have on a seat belt you don't have any kind of security you have any kind of hope of surviving but with the seat belt at least it will keep you in place you might break a home but at least you'll keep you in place you might hit your knee on the steering wheel but at least it'll keep you in place holly you have a lot of injuries but at least hallelujah you could not be moved wow all right i don't know my child but i got a lot of scars but my scars show victory hallelujah amen i got scars of cancer in my brain victory hallelujah i got testimonies of of struggles and trials that god brought me through victory all these things that happened on the journey but it couldn't stop me from getting to my destination amen the worst thing you can do is go on a journey with no seal cause you can imagine sometimes things get stuck on the track and it's hard for a train to stop and not just out of 10 it's going to collide with it hardly and if the product is not sealed it's going to be thrown all over the place hardly are you catching me see how important the holy ghost is the holy ghost will keep you in time of struggle holy the holy ghost will keep you place no matter how you might look after the journey might have some some so some tin cans that you know uh come out of it come out of there lightly but it still was in place when it got there some of us going to come out with scars and wounds hallelujah but we're going to come out as overcomers hallelujah listen to the church he would never put that in the scripture hello how he grant you and i he that overcome he never put that there he never used the word overcome if we didn't have something to overcome hell yeah so god puts things there he puts the word overcome there simultaneously while we're overcoming whoa oh my church remember remember why i'm closing simultaneously existing occurring or operating at the same time and remember when job and the sons of god all of them came to present themselves before god who else was there amen the devil was there simultaneously at the same time while god is receiving worship satan is there trying to stop the worship and the only way you could not get anything out of this service is if you allow the enemy to have your mind you got to walk out of here saying i'm sealed you can't you know when something's sealed you can't touch it yeah i know it's water in here i wanna touch it is water in here how do you know i want to touch it though what's stopping me from touching it seal satan can look at you he want to get to you but he can't touch you you know why because of the seal of god oh my church oh i call you this is not closing think about it hallelujah he wants to take all of us through battles but he can't get past the seal and the problem of god said hallelujah if satan can get past the seal then he'd be your brother oh my so check yourself if you find yourself doing things that's not worthy of the nature of god you better check whether you're sealed or not because satan can't get past the seal so if you're doing things that doesn't reflect the nature of god that might mean you're not sealed hallelujah in my closing last thing i'm gonna read he said this should be light in the evening time i don't care how many seals you try to put over it god will break every seal he broke the seal hollya of the tomb he broke the seal of hell he broke the seal of death he broke the seal of the grave and rose forevermore and triumphed over the grave death hail tombs every man made things there was to show that he was god and cannot be sealed cannot be sealed away wow think about that church if you belong to god there's nothing you can do that will keep god away from you i feel my helper coming on oh my we might look at ourselves and say i'm so unworthy but god is saying how can i get to you let me tell you holy there's nothing hurt that you could ever do that'll keep god from coming to your rescue hallelujah i'm gonna read that again he says in triumphs over the grave death hail tombs and every man-made thing that was to show that he was god and cannot be sealed away from the people anymore so i'll say tonight whatever's whatever's troubling you is not strong enough to keep god away from you right now in this moment why because he's already broken every seal he's already loosed every bondage and now all he's wanting to do is to seal you up in him all over again to show you what a real seal is wow to show you what real protection is to show you what real ownership is all right to show you what a real complete work is oh my listen he says god forevermore nothing can hold him the grave could oh the grave couldn't hold him and remember you know what they would do when they have uh deaths and and crucifixions they gonna put it in a grave they put a rock and they seal it did it whole god couldn't hold him grey the grave hell of death couldn't hold out god away from doing hallelujah his redemptive claims holy he said the grave couldn't hold him he said the grave couldn't be dug deep enough there's not a sin you can go through that's deep enough where god can't reach you he said hell wouldn't be hot enough oh my oh nothing could hold him he broke every seal with a great hollywood christmas seal or not christmas seal but easter seal that he was sealed with and he said the same seal that i wear you shall wear also for that and that seal that i wear it shall do the same things when you are sealed hallelujah because remember he says hallelujah is that spirit that raised up christ from the dead it shall do what it shall also quicken your what your mortal body not your theophany honey now when you get on the other side so there's a ceiling that we ought to experience over on this side because he said you're a mortal body there's a life that we should live hallelujah above reproach on this side he says it shall do the same things when you are sealed for he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he do also even greater than thus shall he do for i go unto the father so church there is a simultaneously work going forth church at the same time where there's like covert 19 moving throughout the nation moving throughout the world hey man simultaneously there's a bomb in gilead hallelujah hey man look at it church we say oh my brother dicks it's real it's it's it's it's so real because i have christian loved ones who have died yeah and simultaneously they're there with the lord all right so it looks like they're going to death but yet they're living in christ so let's look at things in the right perspective don't let this fear and all this stuff overcome us amen there's nothing the enemy can do that will ever outdo god so you think about that while you're taking your vaccines i'ma just throw this one out there for free i'm gonna give you something to chew on for free somebody um i'll be at the gym working out and one of my friends say hey reb you gonna take the vaccine i say i treat it the same like i treated cancer when they said i had cancer they say take chemo take radiation i say for what buy stripes i'm healed so why i'ma take something proclaiming i'm sick when he already said i'm healed and then they look kind of puzzled so i said it real simple as have you ever heard old saying if it ain't broke then why try to fix it now you do whatever you want to do it's up to you he said it's according to your faith holy but my faith says i believe god that's how i say he said it says it kind of arrogant too i believe god i believe god i believe god i believe god i believe he's a healer hallelujah i believe he broke the seal of death hell in the grave i believe he possesses all healing power hallelujah i believe hallelujah when he died on the cross that every sickness every bondage everything that could ever overcome us was dealt with right in that moment and by his stripes i am not i will be not one day i am hallelujah glory to god amen let's all stand oh my simultaneously what i want you to do i want you to remember this word simultaneously whenever you feel like you're going through something holy if the devil is you feel like the devil is doing anything if he's doing anything god has to be doing everything because remember god created the devil so the only thing he could do is bring out more of god hallelujah because god won't be outdone so when things happen you have to just take a step back and say why is this happening what is god trying to show me i guarantee you if there's a move of evil there's also a move of good let's pray lord jesus father we thank you for your word lord i pray that you just bring a certain sound of what we're saying lord lord only you can give us understanding on you can give us revelation lord just show us the loosening just to bring us into a ceiling lord how you came and you took every power of the enemy you defeated it lord just to bring back your redemptive claims in our life to put us back in our rightful positions lord we love you and we praise your holy name lord we pray father you just uplift even if each and every spirit each and every individual that's hearing this word lord god that they'll be encouraged to know lord that everything you do you do with a purpose everything you allow you allow for a purpose lord and we

[Music] he walks beside me [Music] [Applause] [Applause] is is that your confession tonight we're gonna make it friends we're gonna make it i i i i just felt so elated just to hear that connection there brothers brother diggs made so many great statements i got many i'd like to repeat but when you realize that the inspector he's not thinking about you know stopping every couple of years in your journey and having to go in and make sure everything's okay when he seals you he sealed you for the whole journey he's already sealed you in other words you're already prepared for the whole journey brother branham would say it like this everything that you have need of for a rapture is in you now hallelujah everything that i have need of do you have a greater need than the rapture everything that i have need of for the rapture is in me now by the baptism of the holy spirit so many simultaneous things i thought about here we are in the darkest day of human history brother dawn but at the same time simultaneously it's the brightest day the bride has ever seen the complete mighty god unveiled and a bride walking in in in a in a as far as god is concerned and a complete perfection you're not maybe going to make the rapture you're going to make the rapture and there's nothing you can do about it amen praise the lord what an hour friends to see that god come in our day with cadre and he he while he while he commenced you know while he initiated a silence simultaneously he ended up silence yes sir oh hallelujah my hallelujah friends he ended a silence down through the ages and and br and open up a word that the world it's a complete mystery to them and here you are and you're not you say oh i see it you more than see it you are it you are it that's what the message came to do was to turn you fully into the revealed word of this hour and that word is leaving the earth that's why you're going in a rapture not because you're smart enough or nice enough but because you have accepted the word and then accepting the word when a prophet came here he had strict instructions for the the strong angel was given very express instructions by the mighty angel make them eat the book hallelujah you had to eat the book amen because the bride would have to become that very word as well my what a sermon i um we only have one request that came in that i have presently from brother mark says please continue to pray for joe all his lung tests came back and according to the heart team at musc he has developed um emphysema as well as the damage from covid they are putting him on two different medicines to try to get his lungs in better shape for surgery and we are we are in a dilemma he has to have the surgery no choice but his lungs are not strong enough they fear that his percentages of not making it through the surgery are too risky he goes to see his local cardiologist tomorrow to discuss what they're going to do imagine being in the fix that the doctor is saying you you can't live without the surgery but you might not survive the surgery now i want you to put yourself in our brother's position tonight and let's call on the lord who like brother diggs said he's already said he's healed already he's already healed it's just accepting it and the and i'm gonna tell you something friends brother branham made it so clear you take him at his words that
