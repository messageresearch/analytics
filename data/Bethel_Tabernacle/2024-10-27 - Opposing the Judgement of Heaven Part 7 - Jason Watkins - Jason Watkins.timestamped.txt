[50:07] wants to come come on we can
[50:09] always go buy more food it's right up
[50:12] the street amen might be a fried chicken
[50:16] but it'll go with the pizza it'll work
[50:17] amen so any anybody that wants to come
[50:20] we can always get more food amen we want
[50:22] to be praying for brother Bradley to
[50:24] have a speedy recovery and trusting the
[50:27] Lord that all of that amen falls into
[50:30] place for him may I say this morning
[50:32] that and I don't I I almost never know
[50:36] how many people are out here for the
[50:37] adult Sunday school class I know it's
[50:39] not attended like the group I see now
[50:42] and uh you know I don't want to go down
[50:45] a road of that I I just want to say that
[50:48] boy if you're not making it to the adult
[50:50] Sunday class you are missing out brother
[50:53] Jason has been on a series correcting
[50:56] all of the woke eras of the age and
[50:59] that's what it's been about our young
[51:00] people are inundated flooded deled with
[51:05] woke ideology and the complete
[51:08] fracturing and destruction of the
[51:09] nuclear family A Woman's Place a man's
[51:12] place and uh I I have been hearing very
[51:16] very balanced teaching on that and I
[51:19] would encourage you especially if you
[51:22] have uh a raising teenagers Sons or
[51:25] daughters or both that you get those and
[51:28] for you husbands and and and wives and
[51:31] Dads Moms you make sure that you go back
[51:34] if you've missed those because I'm here
[51:35] to tell you the word corrects the
[51:38] error and we are not here to let Satan's
[51:42] Eden uh poison the minds of our young
[51:45] people and so uh I I I told Brother JD I
[51:49] said I'm going to come out and say my
[51:51] name is Jason Watkins and I endorse this
[51:53] message that you have been hearing it
[51:56] has been phenomenal amen I think it's
[51:58] worth a round of
[52:02] applause amen and brother and brother JD
[52:05] and only the way that he can do he just
[52:07] so methodically just drops bomb after
[52:10] bomb right from the scriptures right
[52:12] from the message you can't impune the
[52:13] brother because he's backing everything
[52:15] up he's saying with what a prophet
[52:17] taught us but it has to be as Peter said
[52:20] stirring you up by way of remembrance
[52:22] I'm going to tell you something friends
[52:23] we're never this ministry team is never
[52:25] going to back down and let the world
[52:27] steamroll us that's not the program of
[52:30] this pull pit we're here to take a stand
[52:33] for the word of God is that how you want
[52:35] it praise the Lord then you have come to
[52:38] the right place amen Hebrews chapter
[52:42] 11 amen figure out where I want to start
[52:46] Hebrews chapter 11 let's just look at
[52:48] verse
[52:49] one now Faith is the substance of things
[52:53] hoped for the evidence of things not
[52:57] seen for by it the elders obtained a
[53:00] good
[53:01] report now that's two two big points
[53:05] already that it was the substance of
[53:08] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[53:10] Not Seen number two the elders obtained
[53:13] a good report by the operation of it and
[53:15] look at number three through faith we
[53:18] understand that the worlds were framed
[53:21] think about that the worlds were framed
[53:24] by the word of God so that and here's a
[53:27] mindblower This Will Blow fuses so that
[53:30] things which are seen were not made of
[53:34] things which do appear so there's
[53:37] nothing in nature that constructed
[53:40] itself this was
[53:42] all initialized designed well thought
[53:46] out by the Creator and he has an
[53:49] absolute purpose in all of it amen let's
[53:53] bow our
[53:55] heads father we thank you now for your
[53:58] word and we want to look into it now
[54:01] master and we pray that your that that
[54:04] mind of Christ will flow freely Lord
[54:07] we're dedicating our hearts and Minds to
[54:10] you now Lord we have set ourselves aside
[54:14] we've studied this thought we've
[54:16] prepared ourselves and we're a vessel
[54:18] standing here today uh Lord with Clean
[54:21] Hands of course that's only because of
[54:23] the blood of the Lamb has been applied
[54:25] to us none of us are worthy Lord but you
[54:27] have made us worthy and we have followed
[54:29] you now I pray that with nothing
[54:32] hindering that the enemy be be put aside
[54:35] and let the word go forth Lord let the
[54:37] preaching of the Gospel drive back as a
[54:40] prophet described it it cast out Devils
[54:43] by driving them back and allowing the
[54:45] Holy Spirit to sew the word in the
[54:47] hearts of the people uh so Lord let it
[54:50] be so now we commit it to you in Jesus
[54:53] name amen God bless you friends you can
[54:55] be seated
[55:13] we finished last time speaking about how
[55:16] that our lives are infused with eternal
[55:20] life and this gives us it ought to give
[55:23] us an eternal perspective now I know I'm
[55:25] starting late to today um that's on me I
[55:28] asked brother Tony for some extra time
[55:30] and that's why he went so long and then
[55:33] I had a few announcements to make I
[55:34] won't I won't preach keep you here all
[55:36] day so just give me out just a little
[55:38] bit of time and we're going to move
[55:40] through this today I'm not trying to get
[55:42] through it all unless I do unless I can
[55:45] um but we'll just look at that we'll
[55:47] watch that time closely we won't no
[55:49] death worse than being drugged to death
[55:50] right amen praise the Lord so we found
[55:55] that that perfect faith has is where
[55:59] we're speaking on and this of course and
[56:03] I I be honest with you I didn't expect
[56:06] when I started the series opposing the
[56:09] Judgment of Heaven I really didn't
[56:11] expect to come to perfect faith I was
[56:13] thinking about it I thought it'd be part
[56:15] of a different thing I realized that the
[56:17] Lord wanted to incorporate it in this
[56:19] thought now you remember that the excuse
[56:23] my voice this morning
[56:26] it'll get straightened out amen I'll
[56:29] preach it and blow it out once I get
[56:30] preaching but um we we the the whole
[56:34] premise uh of the of our series opposing
[56:38] the Judgment of Heaven is that the world
[56:41] is so opposite of what God has decreed
[56:43] in his word and that we started out by
[56:46] saying as just as a reminder that you
[56:48] would think that that creation would
[56:50] look at its creator and when the Creator
[56:53] weighed in on a topic and gave his judg
[56:56] on the matter you'd think that a
[56:58] knowledgeable creation full of wisdom
[57:01] would go yes sir thank you sir we'll get
[57:03] on that right away but but it's actually
[57:06] the opposite not only do they not in
[57:08] Mass receive his judgments they and
[57:12] there's many of them don't even believe
[57:13] in him at all and they if they do
[57:15] believe in him they believe he's
[57:17] impersonal and not connected and we're
[57:18] just on our own anyway uh and I'd rather
[57:22] believe he don't exist than to believe
[57:23] that but we find that that there is and
[57:27] there was prophesied in the word and
[57:29] Jesus made it clear that those who do
[57:32] hear his word hear it because of the
[57:37] origin of where they came from he taught
[57:39] that in John's gospel so many different
[57:41] places St John 6 St John 8 St John uh 12
[57:46] so many places where he shows that those
[57:49] who hear his word have been taught of
[57:51] God not only are you being taught of God
[57:53] now but there was a time that's somewhat
[57:57] murky to us we we have enough to know
[57:59] that there was a time when morning Stars
[58:01] sang together and we know that there was
[58:03] a time when sons of God shouted for joy
[58:06] and we know a prophet talked about how
[58:08] that that was the plan of redemption and
[58:10] they were being shown the plan no wonder
[58:12] they're rejoicing I'm still rejoicing
[58:15] over that plan because we see ourselves
[58:19] as a part of it and that's the real
[58:21] strength I can tell you friends that's
[58:23] the real strength of being a Christian
[58:26] is when you can see yourselves as part
[58:28] of it that it's not just Doctrine it's
[58:31] not just teaching it's not just a
[58:33] learned lifestyle amen that it actually
[58:36] is intrinsic it actually is is
[58:39] self-evident when the eagle screams you
[58:42] something happened and sometimes it even
[58:45] defies your own ability to explain it to
[58:47] your loved ones who knew you before and
[58:49] say what's happened to you well I I I I
[58:52] heard a I went to church well everybody
[58:54] goes to church yeah but I heard a sermon
[58:56] everybody he that yeah but I I looked at
[58:57] something and I there was an identity
[58:59] there was something you you're you sound
[59:01] crazy I might be but I'm happy this way
[59:05] all I know is that there's some kind of
[59:07] a alien life living inside me that says
[59:09] Amen to every word of God and it causes
[59:13] me to want to go toward the word and it
[59:16] makes me want to live like
[59:18] this that's a nature change that's the
[59:21] new birth a human can't do that to
[59:23] themselves fact is when they're born in
[59:25] sin they're the opp opposite of that
[59:27] amen so it's not just about a learned
[59:30] behavior and that's why it's not a a a
[59:32] book of rules it's a book of life yeah
[59:35] amen you understand it's not about a
[59:37] book of conduct it's about a book of
[59:39] origin it's about a book that shows you
[59:42] that you had a you came from God you
[59:45] believ God you you're you're you're part
[59:47] of the word that came from God
[59:50] am so we find then that that that that's
[59:55] the that's the part where perfect faith
[59:58] can begin to operate if
[1:00:02] you if you
[1:00:04] don't are not in that position in your
[1:00:07] life full of the holy spirit of
[1:00:10] God to operate perfect faith is going to
[1:00:12] be very difficult for you amen amen very
[1:00:16] difficult for you because you're you're
[1:00:18] too as brother brandom used the old
[1:00:20] timey word galed up you're you got too
[1:00:22] much gum you got too much sludge you got
[1:00:24] too much of the world there's too much
[1:00:27] obstacle the word can't flow through you
[1:00:29] you're a conduit that's what you're here
[1:00:30] for you're a conduit you're supposed to
[1:00:33] be the word made flesh living on the
[1:00:35] earth again while Jesus is in heaven
[1:00:37] amen amen that's the mission that's why
[1:00:39] the gospel came so so naturally our job
[1:00:43] then we found out to be able to operate
[1:00:45] perfect faith is that we we we have
[1:00:49] found that it's all about our dedication
[1:00:52] to God our belief in his word our
[1:00:55] trusting uh in his life and I'm I you
[1:00:58] know I I I I'm just trying to figure out
[1:01:01] how I want to bring this today so so we
[1:01:05] we found out that then because Satan
[1:01:07] knows Satan already knows he can't stop
[1:01:11] the word amen that's been tried he
[1:01:14] failed miserably every time he's ever
[1:01:17] tried that he fails so what he does is a
[1:01:21] prophet said he attacks the vessel that
[1:01:23] carries it now as preachers we know know
[1:01:26] that he does that by putting sickness
[1:01:28] and attack us and we try to come to
[1:01:29] preach and our throat is uh you know
[1:01:31] grally and we're trying to we don't have
[1:01:33] enough strength or whatever and it takes
[1:01:35] the anointing to help us he's always
[1:01:37] trying to hinder The Vessel but that's
[1:01:39] also that's you and me in our daily
[1:01:42] lives his his goal is to try to fill you
[1:01:46] up with the stuff of the world turn your
[1:01:50] eyes away from Jesus put your eyes on
[1:01:52] Hollywood put your eyes on the nonsense
[1:01:55] put your eyes own career and education
[1:01:58] nothing wrong with those things but
[1:01:59] Satan Jesus said seek ye
[1:02:03] first in other words it's it's that's
[1:02:05] the order of things your life should be
[1:02:08] word driven Christ first that brother
[1:02:12] brandham said he needs to be first in
[1:02:14] your life he doesn't want to be second
[1:02:17] he doesn't deserve to be second I think
[1:02:19] that's such a true statement he doesn't
[1:02:21] deserve to be
[1:02:23] second see and and everything you do and
[1:02:26] it's not just I'll put him first and
[1:02:27] then okay he's at the head of the line
[1:02:29] now I can pay attention to everything
[1:02:30] else it's not it's more than that it's
[1:02:32] the order of everything all of the other
[1:02:34] things down your list of career and
[1:02:36] education choice for a spouse how you
[1:02:39] live Recreation entertainment vacations
[1:02:41] whatever you do Christ ought to be the
[1:02:44] first consideration in every one of
[1:02:46] those every one of those areas and and
[1:02:50] that's how perfect faith can operate and
[1:02:52] we found out that perfect faith is not
[1:02:54] just something under the opening of the
[1:02:56] seals we found out it's a very ancient
[1:02:58] power that Joshua operated job operated
[1:03:02] it Abel operated it see and so it's a
[1:03:05] revelation that you receive of God's
[1:03:07] word and you you live your life in such
[1:03:10] a way that God can flow through you so
[1:03:14] this is you know we we finished off last
[1:03:17] time when we were talking about I said
[1:03:19] you know there there Hollywood has their
[1:03:23] ideas and science has their ideas what
[1:03:26] they call a Multiverse and that's uh
[1:03:28] almost become uh you know ubiquitous
[1:03:30] today when they're describing realities
[1:03:32] and ples of reality and they they talk
[1:03:34] about a Multiverse there is a
[1:03:37] Multiverse just not like they
[1:03:40] think we can see in Daniel where we read
[1:03:42] last time 8:13 then I heard one Saint
[1:03:45] speaking and another Saint said unto
[1:03:47] that Saint uh unto that certain Saint
[1:03:49] which spoke how long shall be the vision
[1:03:52] we know that that that that Ezekiel
[1:03:55] talked about Joshua the high priest
[1:03:57] standing there before the king and he
[1:04:00] says if you'll keep my word and obey my
[1:04:02] statutes I'll give you place among these
[1:04:05] you see so I know there is a Multiverse
[1:04:07] I know there's more than this I know
[1:04:10] there's another world I know it's coming
[1:04:12] I know that's our destiny I'm telling
[1:04:13] you I say it all the time our future is
[1:04:16] bright friends don't let this world drag
[1:04:19] you down don't let it depress you and
[1:04:21] fill you full of anxiety your future is
[1:04:24] bright don't let it cause you to think
[1:04:26] suicidal thoughts and think oh it's no
[1:04:28] use in trying listen friends try as hard
[1:04:31] as you want you'll never get there
[1:04:33] somebody's already paid the way for
[1:04:37] you all in 10 so the the whole trick is
[1:04:41] is is when I when I think about as I
[1:04:43] said closing last time in part six that
[1:04:46] when I think about you know putting my
[1:04:49] my affections on things above that that
[1:04:52] that that's you know more than just
[1:04:54] setting my mind
[1:04:56] on teaching that my mind continually
[1:05:00] perpetually thinks about my loved ones
[1:05:03] who are on the other side who are still
[1:05:05] alive More Alive than me and I'll see
[1:05:07] them
[1:05:08] soon I think about that morning when the
[1:05:11] trumpet sounds and I'll walk in my
[1:05:13] living room and the prophet said you
[1:05:14] have a funny little feeling I'm looking
[1:05:16] forward to that funny little feeling he
[1:05:18] talks one time it'll be like a little
[1:05:20] twinge of pain but it'll be the last
[1:05:22] pain you ever feel in your life oh
[1:05:26] Hallelujah friends we have not a lot to
[1:05:28] live for we have everything to live
[1:05:32] for there is nothing to equal what the
[1:05:36] reward for dedicating your life to God
[1:05:38] and there is not such great a loss and
[1:05:41] needless loss as refusing to do that and
[1:05:44] missing
[1:05:45] out God don't let it don't let it be any
[1:05:48] of
[1:05:50] us so we find that that the key
[1:05:56] to operating perfect Faith the main key
[1:06:01] is that and we we we showed you last
[1:06:05] time I think I did I preached some of
[1:06:07] this in Phoenix I don't remember what
[1:06:08] all I said here but but to really
[1:06:13] understand the key to perfect faith is
[1:06:17] that's the Sunday evening service go to
[1:06:19] brother brandham Sunday morning service
[1:06:21] that set up that service and he preaches
[1:06:24] How can I overcome and from there he
[1:06:27] comes back a few hours later and Carries
[1:06:29] On and starts talking about a perfect
[1:06:31] faith and he says he he starts talking
[1:06:34] about he says I was hunting and I was in
[1:06:36] the woods and he said there was an old
[1:06:38] dead log laid across the creek and he
[1:06:41] said I it was too far to jump so I was
[1:06:42] going to go across this dead log and he
[1:06:45] said and just as I jumped up on it the
[1:06:47] whole thing gave way he said it was
[1:06:48] rotten on the inside you couldn't tell
[1:06:51] on the outside it looked fine he said on
[1:06:52] the outside it looked just like a
[1:06:54] Christian
[1:06:56] strong said you know ready to Bear me up
[1:06:59] but said inside it was all rotted out
[1:07:01] and he said the reason that it was so
[1:07:03] rotted out is because it was laying over
[1:07:05] the top of water he said dead wood in
[1:07:07] the presence of water rots twice as fast
[1:07:10] so you come to church and you you know
[1:07:12] we're not just let me just take it on
[1:07:14] out not just about coming to church on
[1:07:16] some some service you're here today for
[1:07:19] a service but what is your life I mean
[1:07:22] you you certainly ought to be coming
[1:07:24] into contact with the Lord more than
[1:07:26] just a coming to service that's the
[1:07:28] whole that's the whole thing we're
[1:07:31] discovering about applying the token yes
[1:07:35] amen listen friends Brother Brad and I
[1:07:37] were talking about this last night and
[1:07:38] brother brother Tony we were talking and
[1:07:40] I was saying listen I said every year
[1:07:42] when I come to Youth Camp we're finding
[1:07:45] greater and greater and it it does match
[1:07:47] the scripture greater and greater
[1:07:52] instances of young people struggling
[1:07:54] with anxiety teenagers yeah having
[1:07:57] nervous breakdowns and panic attacks
[1:07:59] you're young what in the world get my
[1:08:02] age and you'll have a panic attack my
[1:08:05] goodness full of Youth and vigor and
[1:08:08] vitality you're beautiful you're strong
[1:08:10] you're healthy what do you got to be
[1:08:12] anxious about see so so so you got your
[1:08:15] whole life ahead of you but Satan is
[1:08:17] attacking the minds that's part of the
[1:08:21] insanity brother brandom called it a
[1:08:23] plague
[1:08:25] that's on the age the God of this evil
[1:08:27] age and that's the madness you see on
[1:08:29] the streets that's why you see the
[1:08:32] burgeoning of woke ideology it would
[1:08:34] have never got past first base 20 years
[1:08:37] ago but people are going crazy and
[1:08:39] they're accepting
[1:08:42] craziness to denying basic science of
[1:08:45] gender identity for crying out loud it'd
[1:08:49] almost got cut to that chase because you
[1:08:51] know they can't deny that okay let me
[1:08:53] just cut to the chase I'll just give you
[1:08:54] one you can't deny how about what's
[1:08:56] what's a man and what's a woman well
[1:08:57] they won't even tell you yeah amen amen
[1:09:02] I mean you you don't even know what to
[1:09:03] say sometimes and I don't want to go
[1:09:05] down that road because I get it's too
[1:09:07] [Laughter]
[1:09:08] fun sometimes I want to ask them if they
[1:09:10] have rabies or do they have what how are
[1:09:13] they possibly thinking
[1:09:15] that but it is the anxiousness of the
[1:09:19] hour brother brandham listen brother
[1:09:21] brandham was already calling
[1:09:23] it a neurotic age Amen in the
[1:09:28] 60s come
[1:09:29] on in the 60s we more than half a
[1:09:33] century deeper than that he was already
[1:09:36] saying back then it was a neurotic age
[1:09:39] filled with
[1:09:40] neurotics see so this so this this
[1:09:43] anxiety and this this perplexity of mind
[1:09:47] and the Bible says in the last days
[1:09:48] men's Hearts would fail for fear and
[1:09:51] that's anxiety fear is the fear and the
[1:09:53] greatest fear is the fear of the unknown
[1:09:55] everybody knows something's wrong nobody
[1:09:57] knows what it is and worse yet they
[1:09:59] don't know how to fix it and they just
[1:10:00] hope against hope they just close their
[1:10:02] eyes and hope it's not the end well it
[1:10:04] is and it isn't hallelujah it's going to
[1:10:07] be the end of this world order but it's
[1:10:09] not going to be the end of me it's not
[1:10:10] going to be the end of you it's not
[1:10:12] going to be the end of the Earth
[1:10:14] Hallelujah so so so so then when I when
[1:10:17] I look back at that now now I begin to
[1:10:22] see cuz as I was saying in our youth
[1:10:24] camp and every year this is our fourth
[1:10:26] year and every year it's increasing
[1:10:28] young people coming up with fear and
[1:10:30] anxiety and last year it was like a
[1:10:32] third like a third of young people this
[1:10:36] camp we had almost brother Matt gave us
[1:10:38] the count it was almost just nearly 70
[1:10:42] different churches represented at our
[1:10:43] youth camp amen and and time after time
[1:10:47] they were coming up fear anxiety fear
[1:10:49] anxiety fear anxiety fear anxiety and
[1:10:53] and we find out that I began to think
[1:10:56] about that and I realized as I was
[1:10:58] pondering that I said Lord I think that
[1:11:01] we weren't
[1:11:03] catching the
[1:11:05] real full depth of meaning that the Holy
[1:11:08] Ghost was trying to get across to the
[1:11:10] people in the 60s when he had a prophet
[1:11:14] preach the token amen and he said apply
[1:11:19] the token to your home to your family to
[1:11:23] your children and we've sold you many
[1:11:25] times that when you apply something you
[1:11:28] if you're going to put a veneer or
[1:11:29] laminate what do you do you apply it you
[1:11:32] bring it into
[1:11:34] contact applying the token is not a
[1:11:37] message cliche amen it's an instruction
[1:11:41] to bring your home into contact with the
[1:11:44] Holy Spirit bring your children into
[1:11:47] contact with the Holy Spirit I'm
[1:11:49] bringing them into contact twice a week
[1:11:52] but I don't live with you they need to
[1:11:54] be brought into into contact by the
[1:11:56] parents and I and I think that we
[1:12:00] underestimated how neurotic and crazy
[1:12:03] the age would come and I think we might
[1:12:05] need to go back and reassess and say oh
[1:12:08] I need to apply the token to my children
[1:12:12] to my home to my family because that's
[1:12:16] the only thing to combat the Neurosis
[1:12:18] that's on the
[1:12:20] streets
[1:12:21] amen and if you're not doing it no
[1:12:23] wonder your children are full of fear
[1:12:25] anxiety and it it was even increased
[1:12:27] again this year I think it was more than
[1:12:30] a third brother Donnie I heard went home
[1:12:32] I haven't heard it yet he went home his
[1:12:33] own assembly last Wednesday and preached
[1:12:35] the whole sermon on it it's shocking
[1:12:37] it's alarming to us as ministers I'm
[1:12:39] here to tell you something friends the
[1:12:41] Holy Ghost brings a peace that passes
[1:12:44] understanding it that's the scripture is
[1:12:47] that the scripture that's the promise of
[1:12:50] the Holy Ghost I understand genes and
[1:12:52] heredity and I understand menopause and
[1:12:54] I understand hormones I get it but I'm
[1:12:57] here to tell you there's an answer in
[1:12:58] God's word there is a solution there is
[1:13:01] a peace that you can have and you
[1:13:03] deserve it and your children deserve it
[1:13:05] and your family deserves it this church
[1:13:08] deserves it why because we are
[1:13:10] believers we are we are entitled to
[1:13:13] these things the whole world is Marching
[1:13:16] for their rights what about
[1:13:19] you they were the the devil listen the
[1:13:22] devil and I'm way away from I'm in my
[1:13:24] notes but I'm all up and down the devil
[1:13:28] was strictly
[1:13:30] instructed and warned by the holy spirit
[1:13:33] in in the Book of Revelation see thou
[1:13:36] hurt not the oil and the
[1:13:39] wine you're going to do everything to
[1:13:41] them you're going to have a white horse
[1:13:43] of deception you're going to have a red
[1:13:44] horse you're going to have a sword
[1:13:46] you're going to have a black horse
[1:13:47] you're going to take their Bibles but
[1:13:48] don't you touch that oil and wine I
[1:13:51] strictly forbid that so the devil cannot
[1:13:55] take that those things away from you
[1:13:56] they are your inalienable rights that
[1:14:00] means you don't need anybody's
[1:14:01] permission to believe God you don't need
[1:14:03] anybody's permission to have faith you
[1:14:06] don't need anybody's permission to get
[1:14:07] the Holy Ghost it's already promised to
[1:14:10] you Hallelujah see and the devil can't
[1:14:13] deny it unless you give him that
[1:14:18] permission unless you you know walk in
[1:14:23] your life and run your home home to the
[1:14:25] tune and and let and let the siren song
[1:14:28] of leoa Let the P Piper of leoa uh take
[1:14:32] you and your children right over a cliff
[1:14:34] I say not so we shall not stand for that
[1:14:38] we're going to keep preaching the word
[1:14:39] of God and if it gets uncomfortable
[1:14:41] buckle up it'll get more uncomfortable
[1:14:44] we want to see the power and
[1:14:45] demonstration of the Holy Spirit and
[1:14:48] parents if you won't preach it to your
[1:14:50] children you're going to have a problem
[1:14:51] cuz I'm going to do it and they're going
[1:14:54] to say why does brother Jason preached
[1:14:56] this at church but you and Mom and you
[1:14:57] and Dad do this why do I have this at
[1:14:59] church but I don't have this at home and
[1:15:01] you're going to be embarrassed and put
[1:15:03] on the spot don't look to me for pity
[1:15:06] I'm going to take a stand on the word of
[1:15:09] God I'm their Pastor just like I'm your
[1:15:11] pastor and we're going to give him the
[1:15:13] unadulterated bare fisted word of
[1:15:17] God hallelujah if you don't like that
[1:15:19] you're at the wrong church because we
[1:15:21] stand on the word of God again and again
[1:15:24] and again and again and I'll keep saying
[1:15:26] it
[1:15:27] again the the the the token must be
[1:15:30] applied to your home no
[1:15:36] excuses the whole world marches and
[1:15:38] demonstrates for their rights and we
[1:15:40] give ours away to the devil
[1:15:44] constantly so so perfect Faith then we
[1:15:48] have
[1:15:49] found and see this is why it's so
[1:15:52] fitting for the series opposing the
[1:15:54] Judgment of heav
[1:15:55] CU as I said to you in one of the parts
[1:16:00] one of the
[1:16:01] installments
[1:16:03] everything the world you see on the news
[1:16:07] and all their marches and all their
[1:16:11] demonstrations and all the signs they're
[1:16:13] holding up and all the liberal media
[1:16:16] they
[1:16:17] have oh o opposes everything God is for
[1:16:25] and they are for everything that God
[1:16:28] opposes that's right tell me I'm wrong
[1:16:33] tell me I'm wrong look on the news look
[1:16:35] at the headlines look at the marches
[1:16:36] look what they're
[1:16:37] saying I I mean look look at the
[1:16:40] resistance against Israel look at the
[1:16:42] resistance against the nuclear family
[1:16:44] look at the resistance again against
[1:16:46] common sense in biology amen right and
[1:16:50] they're and they're getting more and
[1:16:52] more the power and the force of law
[1:16:53] behind them and people are being
[1:16:56] harassed and I'm not here to preach get
[1:16:57] on a political bandwagon the whole
[1:16:59] thing's going Dash and Cinder anyhow
[1:17:02] Hallelujah I don't I don't care to sin
[1:17:04] about that who who do you want to be
[1:17:05] president exactly who the Lord has in
[1:17:10] mind I'm not Prejudice I hate both of
[1:17:13] [Applause]
[1:17:15] them I don't really I pray I I pray the
[1:17:18] Lord will break through on them either
[1:17:20] one of them could be children of God
[1:17:21] unbeknown even to them you know uh but
[1:17:24] but at the same time you know my
[1:17:27] goodness after a while you go where
[1:17:29] where's all this hoopla I mean does
[1:17:30] anybody care about the word of
[1:17:33] God see so so perfect Faith then we have
[1:17:37] found out is the mind of Christ flowing
[1:17:40] through you unfettered that's what it is
[1:17:42] it's not something under the seven
[1:17:44] Thunders the seven Thunders came to tell
[1:17:46] you who you are because that confidence
[1:17:49] in who you are is a necessary element to
[1:17:51] operating perfect faith brother BR
[1:17:53] teaches that in perfect faith and so so
[1:17:56] we find that we have so many you know
[1:17:59] where Daniel was there we were there
[1:18:00] last time and Daniel had been shown the
[1:18:03] sequence of end time events and how
[1:18:06] they've shaped the world and they've
[1:18:07] come to pass perfectly events in
[1:18:09] Prophecy unfolding into history and and
[1:18:12] not merely from Daniel's day but all the
[1:18:14] way back to Genesis and you know Daniel
[1:18:18] was able you know to have faith like job
[1:18:21] job caught that Revelation I know my
[1:18:23] redeemer liveth Daniel went away with a
[1:18:26] confidence that it's G to be all right
[1:18:28] God's got it in complete control Daniel
[1:18:30] wouldn't see it he told him you won't
[1:18:32] see it Daniel it be for the end time but
[1:18:33] don't worry seal it up this is what's
[1:18:35] going to happen and that's exactly and
[1:18:37] Daniel went to sleep with his fathers
[1:18:40] with the confidence that God's word
[1:18:42] would Prevail if I go if I sleep with my
[1:18:45] fathers by tomorrow you just know that I
[1:18:47] went down in faith and I'll rise up in
[1:18:49] that same Faith Hallelujah
[1:18:55] it allows us to look at the world and
[1:18:57] observe the world and yet find comfort
[1:18:59] and find direction and find satisfaction
[1:19:02] in a life well- lived and and may I say
[1:19:05] that's more rare than you might think it
[1:19:07] is a life well-lived because I'm not
[1:19:10] talking about adding zeros to your bank
[1:19:12] account or a third and fourth vehicle to
[1:19:14] your garage that's not what I'm talking
[1:19:17] about I'm not talking about adding you
[1:19:18] know linear feet to your yacht because
[1:19:21] people who have all that linear footage
[1:19:23] of Yachts jump out of 30 stor
[1:19:26] Windows people who have all of those
[1:19:28] garage full of cars end up on drugs and
[1:19:31] kill themselves on overdoses so don't
[1:19:34] tell me that's where peace is that's not
[1:19:36] where peace is peace is right
[1:19:40] here see the real satisfaction that
[1:19:43] comes in knowing that your life has
[1:19:46] realized its perfect course and I and I
[1:19:49] don't remember if I said this here in
[1:19:50] Phoenix but my life is circular it's not
[1:19:53] linear because if it's linear than I
[1:19:55] started here and I'm obviously finishing
[1:19:56] here my life is circular from home to
[1:19:59] home I came from home I'm going back
[1:20:01] home
[1:20:02] Hallelujah and that knowledge helps me
[1:20:05] to operate perfect Faith see so because
[1:20:10] listen friends I
[1:20:11] mean goodness what's the what's the
[1:20:14] alternative living a reactionary life
[1:20:16] that's just animal that's how animals
[1:20:19] operate off of stimuli this happens in
[1:20:22] they don't reason things I'm hungry
[1:20:24] there's an animal I kill it and eat you
[1:20:26] know uh I I I'm walking here comes a
[1:20:29] predator I run and animals everything is
[1:20:32] about stimuli and and and but but that's
[1:20:35] not we are the Human animals uh and
[1:20:38] without the Holy Ghost that's all we are
[1:20:41] just Peter called us brute Beast so
[1:20:43] don't stay that let the Holy Spirit come
[1:20:47] in and make you what you were supposed
[1:20:48] to be here for
[1:20:51] see so um
[1:20:54] you know there's all kinds of advantages
[1:20:56] we have as human beings but my it's a
[1:20:59] it's a pitiful life that that does not
[1:21:02] come to the enlightenment of the word
[1:21:04] and allow the Lord to live through their
[1:21:05] lives I'm trying to figure out what all
[1:21:07] I want to cover today and so so you You'
[1:21:10] realized then that there is a much
[1:21:13] higher purpose and that you have a much
[1:21:16] higher calling you've been called from a
[1:21:19] higher place to a higher place and
[1:21:22] that's what that's what John was called
[1:21:24] at the end of the ages yes the end of
[1:21:27] chapter 3 the beginning of chapter 4
[1:21:30] certainly there's where the Rapture
[1:21:32] takes place in one sense because we're
[1:21:35] not looking for an eighth age and we
[1:21:36] don't need an eighth messenger the
[1:21:38] messenger we have is Christ in the word
[1:21:41] and uh but we and we are in a bride's
[1:21:43] Revival a bride's time a bride's age a
[1:21:45] Harvest Time amen there's an Endtime
[1:21:48] sequence to events uh and and and John
[1:21:52] was certainly called up and the whole is
[1:21:55] that you're called up into the revealed
[1:21:56] word because that's what an Open Door
[1:21:58] represents he had a door opened in
[1:22:00] heaven and the door is always Christ so
[1:22:02] it's a revelation of Christ that calls
[1:22:05] you up spiritually so you can go up
[1:22:07] naturally when you get called up
[1:22:09] spiritually the message comes to you and
[1:22:11] the message is come out of her my people
[1:22:15] be not a partaker of her sins so that
[1:22:17] you don't are a partaker of her plagues
[1:22:20] why and I'm not just talking about the
[1:22:22] tribulation why would you volunteer to
[1:22:26] be under her plagues that are affecting
[1:22:28] her right now and the madness on the
[1:22:31] streets you don't you say how do I get
[1:22:33] free of it don't be a part of her Works
[1:22:36] come out of that come into Christ come
[1:22:38] up into the revealed word let the light
[1:22:40] shine on your life change whatever you
[1:22:42] have to do to change change whatever you
[1:22:45] have to change to keep Satan from always
[1:22:48] filling you up and plugging up the
[1:22:52] conduit it's really that
[1:22:57] simple Daniel
[1:22:59] was taken aside to be taught
[1:23:03] this John was taken aside to be taught
[1:23:07] this and if you look at what Daniel and
[1:23:09] John went through when you get taken
[1:23:11] aside to understand God it's not always
[1:23:13] a pleasant experience humanly
[1:23:16] speaking and Jesus never said it would
[1:23:19] be he never said it would be easy he
[1:23:22] said it would be worth it see
[1:23:25] but but ultimately he said take my yoke
[1:23:28] upon you for my yoke is easy and my
[1:23:30] burden is light and and and if you
[1:23:34] feel that it is a burden on you to live
[1:23:37] like a Christian it's because you're not
[1:23:40] born
[1:23:43] again enough
[1:23:45] said because that you're you're you're
[1:23:48] contradicting the word it it that there
[1:23:50] should be a natural innate desire within
[1:23:53] you to be like God I'm not saying your
[1:23:56] flesh won't struggle against it and kick
[1:23:58] and buck and do every kind of other
[1:24:00] thing and that's why you come to church
[1:24:02] and that's why you read your Bible
[1:24:04] remember something as mechanical as
[1:24:07] instead of reading your Bible one two or
[1:24:09] three days a week you read it four days
[1:24:10] and on that fourth day something magic
[1:24:12] happens remember I gave you that that
[1:24:15] resource you know I'm GNA tell you
[1:24:16] something friends I have proven that
[1:24:18] that's true over the years brother
[1:24:20] brandham said a real Christian reads
[1:24:23] their Bible every every day chapter
[1:24:26] after chapter after chapter now I'm
[1:24:28] going to tell you something you didn't
[1:24:29] know I knew you don't do that
[1:24:32] right amen say how do you know because
[1:24:36] even I don't do that say Are you ashamed
[1:24:39] to admit that I am yeah and I know there
[1:24:42] are some Christians who do open their
[1:24:44] Bibles every day but I'm I'm trying to
[1:24:46] make the point friends that sometimes I
[1:24:49] have found myself allowing business or
[1:24:52] task or stuff
[1:24:55] righten and I go my goodness it's 5:30
[1:24:58] in the evening I haven't even opened my
[1:24:59] Bible today and I listen we're
[1:25:02] humans but let me say it again say it
[1:25:05] again and say it again this is the
[1:25:08] greatest resource of strength you
[1:25:10] have open its Pages go through it
[1:25:13] chapter after chapter do it in a quiet
[1:25:16] place do it when nobody's uh busying you
[1:25:20] right it's work it's effective it works
[1:25:23] see
[1:25:26] so to those of you who do read your
[1:25:28] Bible more than four days a week 5 days
[1:25:30] a week six days a week and those of you
[1:25:33] who read it seven days a week God bless
[1:25:35] you I'm in that club as well I'm only
[1:25:37] making the point that sometimes I have
[1:25:39] found myself too
[1:25:41] careless with that and I I can tell
[1:25:44] immediately almost immediately within a
[1:25:46] day I can say my goodness where's my
[1:25:48] nerves at let me get my Bible let me
[1:25:49] turn on the tape let me go in my office
[1:25:51] and get on my knees and pray give your
[1:25:53] burdens to Jesus Friend oh he's a friend
[1:25:56] oh my goodness there is nothing so so
[1:26:00] effective as the presence of God
[1:26:02] sometimes you can be isn't it true come
[1:26:04] on humans isn't it true that sometimes
[1:26:07] we can be so Twisted torn up upset angry
[1:26:10] whatever is happening the this is
[1:26:13] happening in the home this is happening
[1:26:14] on the job this is happening and man
[1:26:16] you're just about to come apart and then
[1:26:18] suddenly you'll you you'll read a verse
[1:26:21] of scripture or you'll hear a song of
[1:26:23] worship and you'll start to think about
[1:26:25] the Lord and and it won't even take very
[1:26:27] long it's just
[1:26:30] like and then you're gone and your
[1:26:33] troubles you've hit altitude you've
[1:26:34] soared above them all friends there's
[1:26:36] nothing like it oh I invite you live in
[1:26:39] that upper atmosphere live in those High
[1:26:43] atmospheres don't let the world and its
[1:26:46] busyness rob you of that you're entitled
[1:26:50] to that but Satan though he's forbidden
[1:26:52] to take it from you will do it if you
[1:26:54] give him
[1:26:56] permission
[1:26:59] see oh

[1:27:06] to tell
[1:27:08] you your life afterward your presence

[1:27:16] 25 when you're seated there with Christ
[1:27:19] there in the Book of Revelation when the
[1:27:21] sea gives up its dead and the heavens
[1:27:23] depart like a scroll and the dead both
[1:27:25] small and great stand before him and the
[1:27:27] bride is seated with him on the throne
[1:27:30] you know we've got a little over 8 8 and
[1:27:32] a half billion people on the Earth today
[1:27:34] they estimate that there have been
[1:27:36] roughly about somewhere between 108 to
[1:27:38] 110 to7 billion people in the earth
[1:27:42] since as far back as they can date
[1:27:45] history uh works for me I don't know but
[1:27:48] that if that's the number they give but
[1:27:50] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:27:52] when you're Seated on that Throne that's
[1:27:53] going to demon state to all 110 billion
[1:27:56] of them uh that you were you were not
[1:27:59] merely part of the vast numbers of
[1:28:02] humanity of the
[1:28:04] World when they see me and you seated
[1:28:08] there with Christ they're going to
[1:28:09] realize that we were not just part of
[1:28:12] the masses and I don't want to be just
[1:28:15] that I want to be seated on that throne
[1:28:17] and I want to convince as many people as

[1:28:42] king of saints right now it's a
[1:28:44] spiritual Kingdom it is not of this
[1:28:46] world system even as we are not of this
[1:28:49] world that's the reason we act different
[1:28:51] from the world here it is here's the
[1:28:53] reason
[1:28:54] our citizenship is in heaven amen listen
[1:28:58] to this poetry we reflect the spirit of
[1:29:01] the world of our
[1:29:04] rebirth that is
[1:29:07] beautiful our citizenship is in heaven
[1:29:10] we reflect the spirit of the world of
[1:29:13] our rebirth it causes you to think
[1:29:16] different it causes you to act different
[1:29:18] your world view becomes different your
[1:29:21] motives are different your objectives
[1:29:23] are different and you know
[1:29:26] um I I don't want to I don't want
[1:29:29] to take a a dark side to this but let me
[1:29:33] just say that if if these kinds of
[1:29:35] things I can stand up here all day and
[1:29:36] talk about this but if these things
[1:29:38] don't appeal to
[1:29:40] you
[1:29:43] um then it may not be for
[1:29:46] you and God won't Force
[1:29:51] you I I heard some advice given one time
[1:29:55] to my sister I don't think she'd mind me
[1:29:57] sharing it she's told it before uh a
[1:30:00] minister who we both loved had a lot of
[1:30:02] confidence in and Lisa was struggling
[1:30:04] she was in college and different things
[1:30:06] and struggling pulling on her mind
[1:30:08] raised right and knew knew better than
[1:30:10] than some of the stuff she was involved
[1:30:12] in I was there we were all
[1:30:14] there and and and this Minister had
[1:30:17] counseled her a number of times but you
[1:30:19] know how sometimes teenagers are always
[1:30:21] putting things off they's always putting
[1:30:22] them off I'll get there some day well
[1:30:24] you might you're not even guaranteed the
[1:30:26] rest of this day to say nothing of
[1:30:29] cashing checks on tomorrow's day you're
[1:30:31] not even you don't even know if you'll
[1:30:32] get through this day see your life is
[1:30:35] just a vapor it just appears for a
[1:30:37] little while vanishes
[1:30:40] away see and he just finally one day I
[1:30:44] thought it was brutal it was brutal it
[1:30:47] was tough but it did the job it caused
[1:30:50] her to think correctly that's her
[1:30:52] testimony and I've seen the evidence of
[1:30:54] of it and he just said to her sister
[1:30:56] Lisa look how many times are we going to
[1:30:58] sit down here and talk about this said
[1:31:01] listen if you're not going to serve the
[1:31:06] Lord then eat drink and be
[1:31:10] merry go for it have the best life you
[1:31:14] can get all you can do all you can do
[1:31:17] this will be it for you so live it up if
[1:31:20] you're not going to serve God and you're
[1:31:22] not going to make Heaven your home then
[1:31:24] just go at it as hard as you can and
[1:31:26] when it's over it's
[1:31:29] over and that was a
[1:31:32] brutal you know almost like a slap but
[1:31:35] it shook her and she thought about that
[1:31:38] and I thought about my goodness no Lord
[1:31:42] and that was my conclusion that was her
[1:31:44] conclusion I hope that's your conclusion
[1:31:46] no goodness no that's not what I want
[1:31:48] out of life no sir I want him I want
[1:31:51] eternal life I want heaven I don't want

[1:32:09] agent and God is only offering you an
[1:32:11] opportunity to live fully as a free
[1:32:14] moral agent amen the devil's never going
[1:32:17] to let you live as a free moral agent he
[1:32:19] won't let you choose that nature of sin

[1:32:24] to leave the I need to leave the message
[1:32:26] so I can go live free you're not that's
[1:32:27] the opposite of of free that's under the
[1:32:30] bondage of the God of this evil age you

[1:32:34] he'll drive you to every kind of
[1:32:35] ungodliness and you won't be able to
[1:32:37] stop
[1:32:38] you I'm here to tell you there's only
[1:32:40] one way you've got to pass from Death to
[1:32:42] life you got to be
[1:32:44] reborn rejuvenated Hallelujah let the
[1:32:47] Holy Ghost come into your life and then

[1:32:54] living in in
[1:32:57] skin you're lifted up from the death you
[1:32:59] were born into and called up into a
[1:33:02] higher life and a higher understanding
[1:33:04] this is Harvest Time friends that means
[1:33:06] brother brandham talks about the sound
[1:33:08] Berry he said once you go past that then
[1:33:10] it's unlimited this is Harvest time
[1:33:12] we're in the time of unlimited there is
[1:33:14] nothing limited that God can't do for
[1:33:17] you amen if you can believe it and
[1:33:20] accept it you don't have to be bound as
[1:33:22] we taught in part two or I think part
[1:33:25] three about the you're not under the
[1:33:27] you're under a law of Liberty the law of
[1:33:29] love you're not under the the Old Law
[1:33:32] see and so you're under a new law and we
[1:33:35] found
[1:33:36] ourselves many of us were were willing
[1:33:38] to go beyond the camp of our human
[1:33:41] weakness I just say Lord It's you know
[1:33:43] they used to uh when when the dust bowl
[1:33:46] came there they over overworking the
[1:33:48] land and destroyed all the top soil and
[1:33:51] then you know they're in the 30s and
[1:33:53] they the great dust bowl that came
[1:33:55] across those planes and people were
[1:33:57] headed to California and they had all
[1:33:58] their you know the back of their modeles
[1:34:00] and they had a sign California bust
[1:34:02] you've seen old pictures like that I'm
[1:34:05] I'm going to tell you something it's um
[1:34:07] I I I I just say it's it's it's heaven
[1:34:10] or bust it's Christ or nothing
[1:34:14] Hallelujah I'm ready to go beyond my
[1:34:16] human weaknesses um the ones that I was
[1:34:19] born with and that's what the devil's
[1:34:21] afraid of the devil's afraid you'll do
[1:34:25] that he knows he can't stop you if you
[1:34:28] do that see so so you have those rights
[1:34:32] in the holy spirit
[1:34:35] amen so I I I so when we talk about
[1:34:39] resisting the devil you know the the
[1:34:42] devil is always trying to keep you from
[1:34:44] it to deny those rights to you and but
[1:34:47] you have the right to rebuke that just
[1:34:50] like Jesus did just like Michael did
[1:34:52] disputing over the body of Moses the
[1:34:54] Lord rebuke thee see and so because you
[1:34:57] have that right I mean that's where I
[1:35:00] think we we when we came down to Daniel
[1:35:02] listen let me just say this as I as I'll
[1:35:04] go off the air with this and I'll just
[1:35:06] I'll just pause right here got a lot
[1:35:08] more to say we'll stop right
[1:35:11] here Daniel was in a position very much
[1:35:15] like we
[1:35:16] are he was captive in a heathen
[1:35:21] Nation he he was actually worse off than
[1:35:25] you because not only was he captive in a
[1:35:28] heathen na in a heathen nation which
[1:35:30] meant that everything that Nation went
[1:35:32] through he
[1:35:34] suffered all the madness of Babylon of
[1:35:38] Babylon Daniel had to live under that
[1:35:41] all the craziness of this age of leoa
[1:35:44] you say Lord you've left us here too
[1:35:46] long well that's certainly a legitimate
[1:35:49] feeling but in the plan of God that's
[1:35:51] impossible there's nothing out of cater
[1:35:54] nothing out off kilter God knows exactly
[1:35:57] what he's doing he has us here for a
[1:35:59] reason we' all like to be home but he's
[1:36:03] got me here so I just say Lord then I'll
[1:36:05] keep fighting until I'm not here cuz
[1:36:09] I'll be here till I'm not so while I'm
[1:36:11] here I'm going to keep fighting and I
[1:36:14] but I know that we're at the end of all
[1:36:15] the ages and Daniel was coming you know
[1:36:18] near the end Israel wasn't going to be
[1:36:20] there forever there was coming a day
[1:36:21] when they would go back and rebuild the
[1:36:23] Temple amen and Daniel when he saw when
[1:36:27] Daniel saw the things that you and I
[1:36:31] would face now he didn't see everything
[1:36:34] on our streets but what he did see is
[1:36:37] Beast
[1:36:38] representations of the political am
[1:36:41] religious and Demon power that triun of
[1:36:45] power at the end time he saw religious
[1:36:47] symbols political symbols and demonic
[1:36:50] symbols amen and it was very bad and
[1:36:53] Daniel was very concerned my Lord When
[1:36:56] shall these things be and it was so it
[1:36:58] was so amazing because every time the
[1:37:00] Lord would come to to give him something
[1:37:03] Daniel would faint and I mean we get
[1:37:06] like that sometimes sometimes this world
[1:37:09] you just are almost overwhelmed and then
[1:37:12] the presence of God comes in Daniel get
[1:37:14] up on your feet and first he set him up
[1:37:16] on his knees and he said I I was laying
[1:37:19] there like my face to the ground I
[1:37:20] thought Lord how many times have I fell
[1:37:23] like I'm just steamr I'm just laying
[1:37:25] there unconscious with my face on the
[1:37:28] ground but a hand came down upon him and
[1:37:30] said Daniel sit up you've got to know
[1:37:33] these things and and he lifted him up to
[1:37:36] his knees and he's all wobbly and then
[1:37:38] another place it happens to him again
[1:37:40] and he said I went down again and there
[1:37:41] I was and my face to the ground and even
[1:37:44] the men around me this world around you
[1:37:46] they don't even hear the voice you're
[1:37:48] hearing they don't even know what you're
[1:37:50] experiencing you're crying you love the
[1:37:53] Lord what's wrong with you they the men
[1:37:55] that were with me did not didn't hear
[1:37:57] the voice they didn't see the light but
[1:37:58] it knocked me to my face and Daniel get
[1:38:02] up and he said and he finally the angel
[1:38:04] calls out to the Holy Ghost over the
[1:38:06] water come said you you've got to you've
[1:38:08] got to help and he comes and he puts his
[1:38:11] hand on him Daniel get up and he he said
[1:38:14] he stood me up on my feet oh I'm going
[1:38:17] tell you something friends that's what
[1:38:18] the Lord will come for you that Holy
[1:38:20] Spirit will stand you back up on your
[1:38:22] feet I know a crazy world and I know
[1:38:25] that it's so forboding and the things
[1:38:27] that we see in Prophecy in the world but
[1:38:29] just like the Holy Ghost came to Daniel
[1:38:31] he'll come to you he'll come to your
[1:38:33] home he'll come to your family he'll
[1:38:35] stand you up on your feet because with
[1:38:38] Daniel listen with Daniel he was only

[1:38:48] fathers when will this happen that's

[1:38:54] know it and and and you're going to
[1:38:56] sleep with your fathers but I'm here to

[1:41:28] you do a whole preliminary sister Debbie
[1:41:30] and I jam out over Sunday morning on
[1:41:32] bethl music amen we love it praise the
[1:41:36] Lord bow your heads with
[1:41:43] me
[1:41:45] Father we thank you this morning for
[1:41:49] your
[1:41:50] word we thank you master that you have a
[1:41:54] Divine Purpose and a divine plan that
[1:41:56] you are working out and we're aware of
[1:41:58] it Lord I'm aware of it today just as
[1:42:01] just as going through this sermon and I
[1:42:05] I un kind of unlike Lord unlike my
[1:42:08] normal way I'm you know my way where I'm
[1:42:11] most comfortable I can go methodically
[1:42:13] linearly step by step today you've just
[1:42:16] had me even studying trying to prepare
[1:42:18] today it just seemed like I was above
[1:42:21] and then below and then pulling the
[1:42:22] lower part to the middle and then the
[1:42:24] upper part back down and moving stuff
[1:42:26] around and even standing here preaching
[1:42:28] it I've just tried to follow the mind of
[1:42:30] the Holy Spirit but yet in all of it I
[1:42:34] can see it's you I can see sometimes
[1:42:37] Lord that the chaos of our lives and
[1:42:40] we're not even aware Lord we sell
[1:42:42] ourselves short we miss out on
[1:42:45] opportunities we come here to the house
[1:42:47] of God we hear a a sermon like this and
[1:42:50] it challenges us Lord I trust it does
[1:42:52] father
[1:42:53] I trust that it challenges the people at
[1:42:56] a deep level you've done so much for
[1:43:01] us Lord don't let us live ungrateful
[1:43:05] lives like spoiled children with all
[1:43:08] that you've done and then our lives are
[1:43:11] not given to you wholly and completely
[1:43:13] Lord I want to raise up my both hands
[1:43:15] today say master I'm sorry for every
[1:43:18] time I ever didn't meet the mark and
[1:43:20] take the challenge and make the grade
[1:43:22] that I needed Lord I I'm asking you to
[1:43:24] help us Lord God help us as an assembly
[1:43:27] we do we see the insanity of the age
[1:43:30] that we live in we know these perils and
[1:43:33] perilous times are all around us Lord
[1:43:36] and yet we know we have a commission
[1:43:37] thou must prophesy again to people's
[1:43:41] tongues and Nations Lord the enemy
[1:43:43] battles us because we don't always seem
[1:43:47] coming sometimes he slips in something
[1:43:50] we thought was harmless Lord there's
[1:43:52] people standing here right now as soon
[1:43:54] as I say that they've got something in
[1:43:55] their mind they know yeah mm yeah that
[1:43:58] one slipped in on me I didn't know and
[1:43:59] now it's got a hold Lord I pray you
[1:44:01] break it I pray that no one should leave
[1:44:04] here today bound up with any feeds of
[1:44:06] Life whatever you did for these young
[1:44:08] people at Camp Lord God multiply it I
[1:44:12] pray the Holy Spirit would grow it don't
[1:44:14] let it slack off a prophet said we can't
[1:44:16] bring a Revival only God can do that all
[1:44:19] we can do is pray that he will but once
[1:44:21] he does we have to keep it going Lord so
