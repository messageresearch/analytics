recovering this this morning she's still in the hospital last night last night okay so um I'd had an update from sister Brenda she was still having some wheezing but it's improving amen praise the Lord glad to see her home amen I was going to go by and see her today and encourage her and pray for her but I'm glad the Lord is bringing her home amen amen and sister Brenda says thank you for your prayers she is receiving her healing amen you love the Lorden turn around Shake somebody's hand say God bless you today happy to be in the house of God doesn't matter how many times you might have done that once I come out you have to do it again I like nothing like the family of God Amen we're going to turn to Luke's gospel this morning and we're going to go to chapter 12 Luke 12 catch 49- 53 amen I want to take a title this morning to start a fire to start a fire and uh I want you to just you know open up your hearts to the word today uh because you know I'm I'm gonna take the first part of it in a certain way and then we're going to flip the script and take it in another way going on from there amen and I'm so glad you'll understand why I'm glad the Lord uh is going to finish it the way that he will amen praise the Lord you believe we've come to the end of all things friends that's true I do a lot of thinking about the Beyond andj thinking about what's next and you know it's a it's a it's an encouragement to me because I know that my future is clear I know that my future is very bright I know that we have much to look forward to in the world coming and I'm I'm glad I want to take as many people with me as I can y'all want to come along amen praise the Lord everybody want to make it amen praise the Lord I want to I want to see you make it I want to see your children I want to see my family I want to see my neighbors I want to see everybody I come in contact with uh make it to the other side now I don't know who all will make it but I'm going to make it amen praise the Lord I am going to make it and so uh I'm glad because the world we live in is has reached a point you know where it's uh it's it life is is you know with under Satan's control for the believer uh this world is just a maddening place and uh but yet we have the answer amen and I want to deal with that just a little bit about you know what sin has done to the world and and and the place of the Gospel in the world but I also also would like to say to you today that regardless of what Satan has been able to accomplish and regardless of you know where you might think of yourself and your own self assessment might not be too high but I hope by the end of this sermon you're going to be in the stratosphere amen amen because it was really encouraging to me praise the Lord Luke chap 12 and I I'm saying all of that because this is a rather ominous text to open with Luke 12: 49-53 I am come to send fire on the earth and what will I if it be already kindled amen but I have a baptism to be baptized with and how am I straightened till it be accomplished amen suppose ye that I am come to give peace on Earth I tell you nay but rather division for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided three against two two against three the father shall be divided against the Son and the son against the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother and the Mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law mine amen wow what are you about to preach brother Jason to preach on starting a fire amen um let's let's continue reading I I I told the booth we'd stop at 53 but I want to keep going and he said also to the people when you see a cloud rise out of the West straight way you say there cometh a shower and so it is and when you see the south wind blow you say there will be heat and it cometh to pass you Hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky and of the Earth but how is it that you did not discern this time yay and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right see so this is a situation where you know the Prince of Peace is bringing a message that don't sound too peaceful now that doesn't make him not the prince of peace all right so what we're going to find out is that the condition of the world it ain't on him yeah it's on us the condition of the world ain't on God when God built it he built it perfect it's mankind that broke it and is still breaking it and in Mass refuses to to let it be fixed now I'm glad that the Lord has a chosen people who are not only only willing willing to let him fix the world but let him fix us amen praise the Lord let's let's bow our heads father we thank you for your word just now as we read it and Lord you you you've been with me throughout the early morning hours Lord as I've said and just waited for you to put all this together and it seemed a struggle for me Lord but I see my way clear now and I'm grateful for that I pray that your great anointing it be upon the people and I don't even know fully what all you want to say but I'm just here to say it so Lord we give ourselves into your hands completely in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated I remember brother Jason making h a comment that caught my attention some months ago in one of his Sunday School classes or it might have been a Wednesday night I can't remember truly but brother Jason references Romans chapter one and I'm not going to take the time to go there today but you know his point was that all of the elements that Paul listed there in Romans one in Romans 1 which which are dire and disheartening and uh and you know it's it's God rendering a verdict of the earth and it ain't pretty and we find that it it was all prophetic because the world wasn't even had not even reached a point uh to what Paul was describing now everything he said was in play but not everything just like the the scripture where Paul says to Timothy at the in the last days perilous times shall come you remember that and we realize that it wasn't Paul wasn't suggesting that they didn't have perilous times in his day it was just simply pointing out prophetically that at the end time if you think it's perilous now amen way till you get there amen and you know know the Lord did not allow brother brandham tells us how that the Lord did not allow the early church to know all about how that he wouldn't actually come in their lifetime they all believed his coming was imminent that he wouldn't even T but he he and according and in God's mind he has not carried I mean in God's time it's only been a couple of days see so that's why the Apostle will say he'll come and he won't T he hasn't carried in his time frame but just remember his ways are not like yours don't go judging God by your standards because you're just a little pepper Speck on sitting on a little dot hanging in space that can barely be seen from you know from our our our Voyager spacecraft looking back sees the Earth as barely a little blue faint little blue dot against a a vast expanse where brother brandham and I'm aware that brother brandham talks about how they're looking to a curve but we don't understand what that means I do know that brother brandham did uh he did verify that uh that when science looks when we look up at stars and science says that those Stars which look close together are further apart from each other than we are from them yeah amen and and brother Brandon verifies that they I mean listen friends it's worlds of Worlds amen and they have certainly believe and they certainly believe that that that the universe is even ever expanding and I've always just said well that's a good thing because an ever expanding Kingdom of the increase of his kingdom there shall be no end an ever increasing kingdom is going to need an ever increasing universe so oh my what's ahead of us amen but we have to while we look forward to that we have to deal with the here and now we have to be real we have to understand that this isn't just some dream that we're living this is real life happening in real time and it's all purpose-driven God has a reason for you being here God has a reason for you being here right now not back there in Paul's day when Paul was looking ahead saying perilous times are coming and they're going to be uniquely worse and in Romans chapter one all of the various things that he uses to describe what's coming uh you're here yes this is you're it tag you're it and and they and as I said brother Bram said God didn't let them know that it was going to be 2,000 years of history and seven contiguous Church ages but but but because he said two for two reasons number one it would have it would have discouraged them but it would have also taken away their Zeal because why why press if you don't feel like it's imminent oh it's not coming in my lifetime anyway hey can I say to you today there ain't no more ages there ain't no more Messengers there's no more time remaining you're this is it we're not at the end time we're at the end of the end time and so it would be most foolish to bet against the scripture and think that life is just going to go on and on and on I'm I'm not here to suggest to you that that won't happen I'm here to tell you emphatically it can't happen right amen he is finished with the age of mankind living in a fallen condition brother brandham calls it that the age of man and I I don't I don't speculate on what that might mean I I've often wondered you know how did how did humans you know coexist with dinosaurs and maybe were they when were they destroyed were they tame was that before the fall was that I mean how did they run from them when when did all this happen was that in Noah's day I don't know the answers to that I know we'll understand it better by and by but I know that the prophet talks about an age of man maybe there was a time that they were here before man I don't know brother brandham talks about a a a ruined civilization some pre-existing civilization we don't know it doesn't matter I'm here right now and I got to I got to deal with life headon as it comes to me there's no getting out of it getting around it or getting by getting by it Jesus started a fire and you're going to have to go through it the Hebrew children Shadrach meach and Abednego could not avoid it amen they had to go through that fire to seal their testimony and so do you so since you have to go through it and you can't get out of it may I suggest the Fourth Man may I suggest that you have the Fourth Man In The Fire say I want the Lord Jesus well they did too he was in the fire so don't run from it don't cry over it don't collapse over it face it he's there he's with you wherever you go he said I will never leave you nor forsake you amen and it was incredible how that brother Jason was showed that list in Romans 1 that nearly every last single one of the elements Paul describes if not all of them are either either mostly almost entirely history they were prophecy when Paul wrote them they're history today and and even even even the last ones maybe we're at the very last one and it's being fulfilled as we speak Amen in Luke 12 and 50 where we read in the w expanded translation it says it like this moreover I have an immersion by which I will be overwhelmed and let let me Let me refresh you from the King James but but I have a baptism to be baptized with and how am I straightened till it be accomplished from the W expanded translation moreover I have an immersion by which I will be overwhelmed now you would think that Jesus would have been his next line would have been so I'm running for the hills that's what humans would normally do if you found out that they're suffering ahead of you you're going to run the other way that's right if you find out that somebody is plotting evil against you you're not just going to keep going forward as if you hope it happens right but then again you're not the Lord he says I have an immersion by which I will be overwhelmed how am I hard pressed from every side until it be consummated amen he he he just wanted to get it over with they they said they wanted to make him a king Lord don't do it and he said the cup my father has given me to drink what are you suggesting Simon that I not drink it I I remember um was it brother uh step coffee was ministering here and talking about how he was going back there referring to brother brandham in the quotes and brother talking about how Jesus you know he didn't want to die he didn't have a death wish he had his Brethren he loved life he loved his Brethren he didn't want to die he had a will but he he he found a way to surrender and say not my will will thy will be done friends that's got to be our heart it do to say not my will ultimately Lord not my will thine be done as long as you have confidence that that he's not going to lose you and that he can he can hold on and even if you go to the Grave he can raise you up and that he will never you're in your F in his father's hand and you can never be lost from it what a confidence it ought to give us and how that Jesus was brother Steven was saying how that here he's sitting around the fire cuz he was just a man who sat around the fire with his disciples and he loved them and they laughed and they had fellowship and just like we would sit around and laugh and have fellowship and talk about the good things of God brother brandham on testimony on the sea he's got all the disciples out there in a boat and everybody's vying let me tell it let me tell my testimony oh wait oh no hold on I want to tell mine first they all want to tell of the great things oh I remember when he came down that day and took those and and he took those fish and those Loaves and I watched it multiply right in front of my eyes oh my what a story well what about that time we were thought we were doing doomed boys we thought we were finished and here he comes walking on the water and and at first we thought it was a ghost and started screaming bloody murder and he ran up to the boat on the water and said said calm down it's me and he said and then suddenly we're at the shore it has teleported us from the middle of a Raging Sea he can do that today he can teleport you he can transport you from a raging Inferno just like the three Hebrew boys and just take you right through it and there won't even be the smell of smoke on your garments he can take you you're in the middle of a raging Storm he can put you on the shore right now amen see so from Eugene Peterson's translation called the message he in in in verses 49 to 53 where we've read Peterson translates it like this I've come to start a fire on this Earth how I wish it were blazing right now I have come to change everything turn now this is this is some different language from the lowly Nazarene yeah suddenly now the lowly Nazarene walking the shores of Galilee going about doing good with gentle words and a gentle touch and embrac children and blessed them and raised the dead and and and and was and had compassion upon people and now here he's saying hey I've come to start a fire on this Earth and in fact is I wish it were blazing right now I've come to change everything Lord what do you mean turn everything right side up how I long for it to be finished God he's not he's not you know it's not a death wish he's not he's not a a a a purveyor of Doom and Gloom he's just simply you you're here today saying oh I just wish it was over he was saying that 2,000 years ago Amen Let Me let me tell you something the one who chose you and called you and saved you he has a kingdom and he desires you to be there more than you desire to be there but but he knows best how to get you there and that's where trust comes in amen where we have to have confidence he goes on in Peterson's translation here those 49 to 53 do you think this is Jesus do you think I came to SM smoth things over and make everything nice oh not so not so I've come to disrupt and confront from now on when you find five in a house it will be a father against a son a son against a father a mother against a daughter A Daughter against her mother and and and and and I just say to you today friends that while is this is shocking to hear the Gentle Savior say but sometimes this kind of shock is necessary to awaken people from some kind of a dreamlike stuper or blindness that we walk around in and we have to go oh my goodness and God uses these kinds of things amen there is in case you didn't know it say what is wrong with the world and everybody's asking that everybody's saying what is wrong with the world and and you you can't hardly find the man on the street who sees you know we we we my wife and I were talking about just this morning and and I they're talking about you know the the covid and how many strains of covid and and and it's only and there's so many more and I said well you know it's I stood in a p in this pull pit several years ago and I said well not going to fear it because there'll only be five more behind it and 10 more behind those five and then 10 more behind those 10 it's not going to get better brother BR there's no peace till Jesus comes brother brandham fell under under prophecy and fell into a vision and came out of that vision and said thus sayeth the Lord if you ever see musini head to Ethiopia then from that point there will be no peace in the earth until Jesus comes and he said they wanted to they P they were threatening to arrest me for saying something like that that I was you know they they they wanted they wanted to kind of you know accuse him of stirring up a riot an Insurrection and he all he was doing was saying what God had showed him but what the what the blind World couldn't see is his prophecy was connecting to the trumpets and the vs not here to preach on that today but it was perfect and and it and it the if the first W produced a a world a first world war and a second woe produced a second world war and the second woe doesn't even in until you're already in the tribulation then you tell me where's the Breather we're going to get a breather no we're not the world has constantly been at War since that hour and it won't be peaceful until Christ comes and sets up a millennium and the second woe doesn't even end until Revelation 11 we're already gone Moses and Elijah have now been martyred the 144,000 are martyred the foolish virgin are martyred and the Bible says the end of the second woe now cometh the Third Woe quickly oh I'm here to tell you something friends hide me in the Cliff of the rock you think the world is troubled now you can't spell trouble compared to what's happening amen and you say I just want it to be over so does the Lord and people say what is wrong with the world and you know and I and I and I just read an article you know and they they saying there's so many variations of Co now and it's only not a new pandemic cuz it's not killing people it's it's just mild flu but there's so many variations and I just read a headline just just yesterday or the day before and it said and the headline was why are all my friends sick and everybody's sick and we're constantly hearing it we got sick people out today and we had them last week and the week before Oh I'm here to tell you and and then you've got the insanity of that's going on in the world and was talking about wars and rumors of wars you always Jesus said you have that but the end is not yet wars and rumors of wars just simply are the judgments pouring out but there are certain things that he said when you see this now then look up your Redemption draweth nigh he would say another place when you see this this and the other then know that summer is nice so we we get these Clues to to show that we're at the end time and the whole world you know is uh you know I I I've testified to you some kind some couple years ago go uh and I I I caught the the openings the opening volley of the you know the Nightly News anchor watching it on a an archive on my laptop and he opens up with this is his opening line friends the world is falling apart amen that's the opening wter kronite except it wasn't kronite it was one of our guys right here in the modern day it just a couple years ago the world is falling apart and the average man on the street shakes his head you can get a conversation started just like that and people are just at at a loss for what is wrong with the world and as a preacher I I I I have the answer it's not one that everybody wants to hear because they're hoping it can be fixed politically or economically or something like that or or somehow love just love and then there's music and music can fix it and government can fix it which can't fix anything and and you I don't mean to say that like that but but but we're all laughing because we know that's the truth it's kind of like the oxymoron of military intelligence so but anyway uh I I've I've said to people and you would be amazed how many people are like huh what where where's that what do you mean I wonder do people even read the Bible in this country anymore right I don't think they do I think they just go to these churches they hear these flower feel-good speeches you know where they don't deal with sin and they don't they don't they don't identify modern events and prophecy and I'm I'm like well you do know there's a strong delusion that was to be released on the earth at the end time a a what a what a strong delusion what what does that mean what does that even mean preacher and then you're you're trying to break it down to say listen there's a there's an atmosphere of insanity yeah really yeah it's under of the seventh vial it was a it was a plague that broke out in the air and you can't get a vaccine or wear a mask or social distance from it it's in the atmospheres it's part of the plagues now it doesn't thank God none of those vials come in their fullness until the tribulation period but all of them just like the seals were partially broken open down through history yes amen and plagues drop brother brandham said he says that right on tape brother brandham throws up a rock in the air and says judgment striking the West Coast now from here it'll just get worse and worse and worse and the world is going to get worse with no let up I'm here to tell you for the bride it'll get worse and worse but we go up thank God thank God thank godl but there is a a an inbred corruption that has been brought on the earth from the cruelty of sin and the fact that this is Satan's Eden and Mankind has been eating from the Tree of knowledge and and that has perverted I mean listen friends even biologically that has perverted the gene pool of humanity amen amen absolutely you know they they they you know I I had somebody say to me one time said that uh homosexuality it it can be proven by scientific that that it's in the genes and and and so you know I said well look I'm I wouldn't deny at all that we're all born with various propensities brother brandham called it weak spots you have to keep your guard over it's just the problem is we just need regene come on that's the real problem the world has you were you were born in sin but not only that agees ahead of you were and by now brother brandham said even went to Food and hybrid food and said it's killing our brain cells and we've got Insanity on the streets that a prophet is identifying from hybrid food I hope you pray over your fooden I hope you're like Thomas Jackson who didn't even take a drink of water without thanking God for it Stonewall Jackson let tell you something friends this is no time to be away from the F Pillar of Fire this is no time let me warn you this is not the hour to be distant from the pillar of fire he told the Jews he said stay close because you're going through a section you've never been here before and you're going to need to stay close and whenever the trumpet would sound they had to pack up camp two and a half million people and because the pillar of fire is moving and as soon as they see it moving they run to the mountain top and blow a trumpet and everybody starts pulling up stakes and packing quickly he's on the Move well if you were somewhere way off in the wilderness and you didn't hear the the trumpet sound I'm here to tell you some friends the trumpet sounds from here don't find your life way off away from hearing the trumpet don't let your life get so full of stuff amen amen you don't have time to come to church and hear the word of God it's a low priority in your life and and everything else is stacked above it when a when a prophet is pleading saying Jesus wants to be first don't make him second he wants to be first in your life he said don't make him second let me tell you something about Jesus can I say how do you know because I had a prophet say it can I tell you something about Jesus he don't want to be second he don't deserve to be second he wants to be first he paid a heavy price to be first but he wants you to let him be first what wife wants to say to her husband I order you to tell me you love me okay I love you what does that mean it doesn't mean anything it's almost offensive if I got to tell you and you know and and and and those are those are things that husbands stand and pledge to Sure guys what do you think what do you what do you think cherish means that's the number one vow I find broken in marriages number one vow the vow to cherish and and not very long after matrimony is is signed sealed and delivered CH cherishing goes kind of by the wayside happens from wives to husbands as well love one another tell them you love them show them you love them you love the Lord tell him show him he loves you he tells you he shows you does he not am I wrong he shows you he loves you thank you Lord it has literally polluted the very gene pool of humanity in this last age it's uh Luke Luke 12 is just an amazing piece of Intel from the heart and mind of the Creator and and all about his plan and we find that that ultimately the plan of the Prince of Peace that that ultimately his ministry would not bring peace but division yeah and the reason it brings division is that because some would accept what he has to say yes amen While others would not accept what he has to say so the chaos so the conflict so the trouble that is in this world is not on God as I said to you already it's on mankind amen the Creator in his grace and his Mercy he doesn't even have to do it he makes his plan known but mankind my goodness in his seemingly a a determined uh Bend there there's like a determined Rebellion that works mankind just determined to work with all his might and people go to extraordinary Le Feats and levels to resist the word of God Amen it's it's shocking because they're resisting mercy and life and God doesn't even have to give it to them amen I mean that's messed up here is God not even he's not even have to do it and he warns you what his life is like and tells you make sure you do this and it and it actually gets down into the nitty-gritty of your life and saying if you want a good life then then then operate from the operator's manual because I I I wrote this for a reason and this will tell you how to live and this will tell you how to be successful and this will tell you and the world is going to have a bunch of other voices that might look like it'll give you a better Advantage than this but ultimately that's death and only this is life I'm I'm sorry I don't have a third alternative that's death and this is life that's it make your choice choose you this day whom you will serve do you want to live or do you want to die that's the bottom line there's not another all there's not a third answer but man in his determined Rebellion say what makes it he so determined it's the it's the uh it's the spirit of delusion a strong delusion that he sends upon the world and and the strong delusion is for one purpose now it's not cruel in the sense of in in the sense of you know God is just some un feeling being who just here's life take it or leave it follow me or die that's not his attitude amen he he so loved the world he gave his only begotten son he so loved the world that he laid aside his Splendor came down and fashioned himself in the form of sinful man and lived a life just like we do so that he could feel everything you would feel you think he had to do they didn't have to do that at all he could have absolutely destroyed the world Jesus said that you think my my father wouldn't presently send Legions of angels destroy this world Set Me Free start over with me just start over with me and then the whole world be populated by me multiplied God is actually going to do that but he's he wasn't going to do it by killing off the world he was going to do it by sending the gospel to his family Hallelujah and this is where the disharmony in the world comes from we have to walk in this fire as I said when I started just like the three Hebrews the only way to survive so let so let me say it again we have to walk in this fire you have to no options there's no out amen okay there's no get out of jail free card there's no exit ramp we all have to walk through this world that is on fire the only way help me say the only way the only way the only way to survive is to have the fourth man walking with youl amen amen but but you have to take a stand for him like they did Eugene Peterson goes on from verses 54 and 56 then he turned to the crowd when you see clouds coming in from the West you say storm's coming and you're right and when the wind comes out of the South you say this will be a hot one and you're right frauds frauds you know how to tell a change in weather so don't tell me you can't tell a change in the season right the god season we're in right now amen you know I it I I I I have no sympathy for people who oppose the word of God right and I have I have pity but but at the same time you know while I have human pity you know God does it like this he says I'll send us if you choose if you make the choice I won't Force you but if you he says if you choose to throw me out of your thinking you don't want my word you're determined to Go Your Own Way fine then I will send on you a strong illusion so that you'll believe a lie and be damned by it and why would you do that so basically I don't have to mess with you anymore I'm I'm now Justified that I gave you a chance you won't be able to accuse me on that day I gave you a chance you didn't want it I'm gonna I got better things to do with my time I need to save my family and if you don't want me fine then then then have a nice life this is it this is all you have right right that's that's why brother the brandom said that we give up our rights say oh yeah well a sheep gives up not not just for that reason not just because the spirit of Christ but you give up your rights brother Ram said if somebody cuts in front of you in line let them you're not from here right amen they're they're actually native to here you're not you're a citizen from above You're an Alien amen you don't have any rights here these people this is the only life they'll ever have you're going to live forever brother Brandon even talks about somebody getting pleasure out of his cigarettes and his alcohol brother I'm said don't take that from him that may be the only pleasure he he ever has tell him about you don't have to settle for that but don't just crush him on it don't don't just make him miserable I'm not interested in bringing somebody off the street and brow beating them into misery where they get just enough Christianity to make themselves miserable we're not that this isn't a prison this is a hospital and I'm trying to bring healing and but maybe you you don't want the medicine okay there's nothing more I can do I love you God bless you but I'm here to tell you there is a bomb in Gilead and you don't have to be a prisoner you don't have to be sick you can be healed but choose these verses from our Lord are exposing the hypocrisy among the religious leaders of his day and they expose the hypocrisy of the religious leaders today the leaders and the people who had you know who had especially in this day it exposes the people who had intentionally sought out teachers having itching ears to tell them what they wanted to hear and give them a convenient version of The Gospel that they wish was true see the gospel the version you want to be that you wish that you want to be true itching ears tell them what they want to hear and so then they'll believe it you tell somebody AE if it's what they want to hear they'll believe it it's very much like Jeremiah in chapter 8 and I'm just going to read you from the Amplified version this is by this point now Israel's in captivity very sad Israel has been depopulated of the Jews and they're now in captivity and God warned them and pleaded with them and sent them prophets and they killed them and send them more prophets and they had eily mistreat them and kill them too and and he he'd rise up righteous Kings and then finally worse Kings and worse Kings and worse till finally they just were taken Israel was taken the 10 tribes were taken uh by the Assyrians and then later Judah is taken and Jerusalem is sacked by Nebuchadnezzar and and we find that that Jeremiah comes with this very sad and this is a this is a three-way call okay this is it's like a a Biblical Zoom call okay there a three-way conversation I just want to bring you in on that this is between Jeremiah and the people and God and Jeremiah says in verse 18 oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow for my grief is beyond healing my heart is sick and faint Within Me Be hold says Jeremiah the prophet listen to the voice now he's speaking to God he he he's crying out to the Lord Lord listen to the voice of the Cry of the daughter of my people for help because of those who dwell in a far country is not the Lord in Zion is not her King in her but the Lord answers why have they provoked me to anger with their carved images and with their foreign Idols the people speak up the people speak up but the Harvest has passed the summer has ended and the Gathering of the fruit is over yet we're not saved Jeremiah jumps back in for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I Jeremiah hurt I go around more morning dismay has taken hold on me is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physici there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people restored and God replies because Zion is no longer Zion no longer enjoyed the presence of the great physician why is she sick why is she not healed why why why are 33,000 in denominational churches filled with sickness why are they not healed because they have the Bible why are they not healed because the presence of the great physician is gone and he he resides only in one place in his word and the only access you have to him is through his word you can't join a church you can't have a society you it's not about a mental Ascent to doctrinal agreement it's not about that it's about your whole heart has been given over to God Amen it is understandable to feel overwhelmed and discouraged at times amen but you know something friends as I I I I I'd like to turn a corner it is understandable I just want to say to you it is the world is a broken sad place and amen nature is still beautiful but mankind has nearly ruined it now and you know it's we can feel overwhelmed and we can all feel discouraged but I just want to say this to you and I say it to you because the world largely sadly doesn't really care all that much they're happy to agree with this statement but really to have any effect of it in their lives only God family is willing to have any effect in their lives and here's my statement it is it it is a a fact that sometimes we get overwhelmed it is a fact that sometimes we get discouraged but we should never lose sight of the fact that God still reigns from his throne he's still in control Satan cannot and has never defeated him this benevolent Creator who a prophet in our day described such almost poetry to me it's not even a sermon it's it's it's more like poetry he describes this Creator as a great fountain in the eternities you're familiar with it you've read the Times where brother Brenham wax is poetic talks about that great Fountain setting in the eternities and now that he designed this world with such great care and such great affection and and and in fact is his love can be seen in The Wonder of nature his love can be seen in all creation Amen brother brandham says in he in his Hebrew series 1957 now mzc this is where we were Wednesday night now MDC was a priest but was he he he is he is what he was I'm sorry here is what he was let me start again now mzc was a priest was he here is what he was we find out that God in the beginning was a great Fountain of spirit amen Bo that is just a a simple Kentucky way of just I I can just get that he's not using all the Greek and Hebrew and this you know and it's just all a bunch of nonsense I I I read one time and I did it here in church and my dad he it was one of his favorite memories of me Ever In a Pulpit he said I he was often would say I love that time when you you know gave the the uh lexical a definition to the word in morphe and and you know I got all the great Scholars together and it was this big wordy long this word and that word and this root word connects to that word and this means that and then in in in the ancient world and then coming through the enlightenment it took on this meaning and you just tring the whole word and by the time you get done I was I filled up the whole screen I said okay everybody got it and everybody's like H you're like yeah and I said okay never mind let me just give you what a prophet said God changed himself that's it what does it morphe mean God changed his mask same God just different mask Hallelujah I'm glad I can know him like that he says we find out that God in the beginning was a great Fountain of spirit is that right he had no birthplace he had he had no dying place he had no beginning of days now he's talking about MDC he had no D he had no birth place he had no dying place he had no beginning of days he had no ending of years he was just as Eternal as eternity is eternal he never was born he never did die and this is why I was showing you Wednesday night that the order of mzc because in the new birth that's what the order you're called into yeah that's what the the the the atonement of Christ does for you it brings you into the same or it makes you like madc see and this was so important what we were saying from Wednesday night's service because the fact that he had no beginning or he had no ending so then your life from its maybe it might have been a horrible beginning and it might have a terrible ending but but none of that matters it's all covered in the sacrifice of Christ because you're in the order of MDC so however you start it however you finish you say yeah but but what about you know what about everything in in the middle part the beauty of that is he abideth a priest continually there is a Perpetual atonement a Perpetual satisfaction before I can even have a transgression he's already confessing Hallelujah that ought to make us rejoice in this sick broken Dying World we have a right to Rejoice I'm in the order of MDC he had no beginning he had no ending so nothing in my beginning or my ending or anywhere in the middle count against me Hallelujah you know there was a sister Dalton who was concerned about her illegitimate birth she had been very concerned about it and she wrote to a friend who you know who who took it you know to brother brandom and he and he wrote back and sister Rebecca Smith published it in her only believe magazine I had sister Debbie go through our collection I found exactly the very one sister Debbie actually found it I thought it was pretty hopeless she found it in about a minute and that's just the advantage of a smarter wife and so so I I I tell my my sons and grandsons don't ever marry a woman smarter than you but I did it myself so I can't hardly enforce that so so I I find that that that that he he he takes this sister you know oh her her case and he's he's sitting there and let me see if I can uh if I can get it right here and and he says he says he says he says it like this he says sister Dalton he wrote her back a letter and I I started to put it on the screen you can actually see that's a picture of it that's that's handwriting right there and this brother Brandon's handwriting and signature down at the bottom and so he writes back to to his friend sister Dalton sitting here alone with brother brandham Ed and Jean and I heard him explain about a bastard child child that's an illegitimate child it was in the Old Testament a type of us under grace brother brandham said that we are all bastard children and are brought to God by Christ so get off your high horse come on Amen you know but for God we just we have no chance see we are all bastard children and are brought to God by Christ we must be rebred by the truth and being born again our Being Born Again In Christ changes everything it changes us from illegitimate to legitimate Sons and Daughters of God Amen in Adam we were of hybrid birth in Christ we are of the true birth and brother brandham writes down at the bottom in his own hand do not fear sister do your new birth or anyone's New Birth corrects it all Hallelujah it corrects it all in the order of mzc I stand perfect before God and I and I just say to I I say to friends and family and acquaintances who could not want that your new birth or anybody's New Birth corrects it all I mean here brother Bram is literally explaining that that th that this illegitimate birth literally that no matter no matter what has befallen you as children of God once you're sealed into the kingdom of God and the blood speaks for you Amen brother BR said God can't even see my sin he said Jesus died for me the blood speaks for me see and he and and so he said it literally reverses all of our sin condition from birth to death you know Ruth was found gleaning in the field Ruth is a perfect type for us here at the end time because that's why brother brandham in the breach at when he's preaching in the seals he preaches God in Simplicity and then he preaches on the breach and there's where he picks up Ruth and Boaz Boaz is the goel the the the goet the Redeemer see he go he he Ste between uh Ruth and this this nearer King Kinsman cuz Satan is a nearer Kinsman to you when you're born in sin he's a near he's nearer to you because you're born with a fallen nature yes see but but so Boaz goes like Christ and says do you want to redeem him Satan can't Satan couldn't redeem God's family see and so first of all he didn't have the money and he didn't even have the will he hates you don't feel bad he hates his own family yeah amen right so he hates everybody he's pure hate yeah and so but Boaz steps in and says then I'll redeem her and he you know he takes his shoe off as a as a sign and that was and he went to the gate that was the courtroom in the East and he he steps out in the middle that it's it's you see that all through the Bible you see you see Moses standing there and here's cor and daythan and Moses said whoever's on the Lord's Side come to me so Moses now is a is a is an intercede he's interceding and keeping everybody live alive when judgments about to fall amen when Moses goes into the pillar of fire walks right into it without a blood sacrifice he doesn't die because he's a prophet and Aaron who would have died if he went in that presence without blood except he's with Moses and since Moses being a prophet the ministry of the son of man is a Ministry of atonement so so now Aaron can walk right in and out of the pillar of fire not die because he's with he's got a prophet oh friends do you see how valuable a prophet a Propet was in our day because what does a prophet do he doesn't just get you the anointing Benny hen can get the anointing he doesn't just get you a blessing pay your ti you get a blessing but he can actually bring you into the presence if you come into the presence without a bleeding word you die it's worse for you to to do that see so David did the same thing David you know he here's Israel and here's the Philistines and here's the devil here's Goliath and David steps he's he steps in between now he's the man in the middle he's in between Israel he's there it's just Christ all through the scripture so so we find that Ruth is gleaning in the field she's a perfect type of the Gentile bride you and I Naomi is the type of the old church the Old Testament Church Boaz is a type of Christ and he finds her gleaning in the field and another word for gleaning in Websters is the word calling now calling is typically used to describe the process of selecting and removing inferior animals or inferior plants from a population to do what to improve the overall quality so you go into a you go into a garden and you call out the weeds and you call out anything that's in remember Jesus said he tells the parable of the landowner and said here's a tree and it all it does is encumber the ground it uses nutrients and it never brings any fruit and all the other trees could use it because they're bringing forth fruit and the man pleads and says let me you know dig about and dung it and I'll fertilize it and if if no fruit you know next season then fine we'll cut it down why should we let it encumber the ground so this is just nature you understand so so so calling you know allows the the you you leave the best so that it can be better and you you take out that which is which is poor and bad so so we find that when Ruth Ruth comes that's what she's doing she's she's a Gleaner she's she's gleaning in the field she's not down picking up uh chaff she's down picking up the choice leftovers because they were they were not allowed the rich men weren't allowed to harvest the corners of their fields because that that would give the poor the poor had the rights of The Gleaners they didn't even need permission they could come into the field and go into the corners and glean and and so so we find that that you know Jesus talks about about that in Matthew's gospel I'll send my angels and they'll separate the good from the bad remember that see and and we talk about how that he will he will you know the the wheat shall go to the barn and the chaff shall be blown away and be burned with in unquenchable fire so this is the process of nature so this is what this is what God is doing God is going down through the Earth and he's gleaning he's calling he's he's taking your life and he's getting rid of all the broken stuff oh Hallelujah and he's only leaving you with what's good he took away all my doubt and all my fear and all my sin took away all my evil desires I now have no more conscience of sin I don't want sin I hate sin I don't desire it I want righteousness amen that's what he did for Ruth and and he comes to Ruth in Chapter 2 and watch this now then she because Boaz comes to her in the the second chapter and says my daughter stay right here in my Fields where right where I found you stay right here don't go into another field I'll feed you I'll protect you I I've told the young men don't lay a hand on you and and and I've got all this Authority and power and I I will'll see that you get rede Redemption and Ruth falls on her face much like we did when Christ began to tell us how much he loved us it didn't matter how we were born it didn't matter what we went through it didn't matter that we had broken lives as children you think Ruth didn't she's a heathen moabit Heathen loses her husband as a young Widow and and when he he's beginning to express all of this love to her she's a foreigner she's not even a Jew of all he's Rich of all the people of all the maidens he could have went after he goes after this one broken widowed moabit yeah amen and she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground I can see myself there yes and said unto him why have I found Grace in thine eyes that thou should us take knowledge of me of me seeing I'm a stranger do you understand I'm I'm a I came I was a heathen you do know that right you don't know no I got almost nothing I can offer you I'm a broken Widow and Boaz answered and said unto her it hath fully been showed me amen all that thou has done oh he said that to me friends I said Lord I'm no good he said I know everything you've ever done it doesn't matter I know about your life I know what you went through I still want you me you want me yes I want you stay right here in my field don't go anywhere oh friends that's the love of God I know the world is broken but God loves you and and then he goes down a list here's now watch this here's some beauty because when he starts naming why he's being kind to her just like Abraham who we know that Abraham committed all kinds of transgressions yeah got caught lying and cheating yeah twice backslid yeah left the promised land brother Ram said anytime a Jew leaves promis on his backslid gets down there lying conniving he loses his he you know he he he he's worried about his own hide but but remember that when when Paul tells the story none of that's none of that's mentioned anymore am it's like it doesn't even exist like it was like it was never part of the record right see because what Paul gets credit for is the one good thing and that is he never staggered at the promise he had all kinds of fleshly failures but none of that counted after Calvary the only thing that counted was his faith in the word of the hour and when he names it to Ruth he says here's here's where you here's where you've done good you you were good to your mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou Hast left thy father and has left thy mother and left the land of thy Nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest not here to before the only thing he names is her good stuff you think she didn't have problems you think think Ru you think Ruth hadn't had a slip or two you think Ruth you think Ruth was like some you know some perfect Virgin Mary type of girl she was a heathen but none of that counted and when he enumerated she said why do you care about me he said because you're this and you're that and you're this and you're that and it was all good I'm here to tell you he only sees the good all the old is gone you're a brand new creation in Christ amen it's a powerful image that conveys the transformative power of Jesus's sacrifice and the hope it offers to those who seek his forgiveness I hope you'll seek it today if you don't know it he's only regarding I'm here to tell you today he's ready to forget every mistake you've ever made and when he's done with you only the good of you will remain see and and we're not talking about necessarily I'm not limiting it to and in fact as by comparison it pales we're not talking about good in this life all your good deeds because your best Good Deeds are still filthiness to him you understand so we're not talking about necessarily you know the things you might say well I've done this good and I've done that good there's none good no not one I'm talking about your existence when you were in him and it's not just good if it's perfect and that's what he's willing to look at you as as perfect the Rapture you understand friends that the Rapture is the final gleaning It's the final gleaning of 2,000 years so that in the resurrection you know he gives you a a final calling on Resurrection morning you looking forward to it on Resurrection morning he gives you a final calling that leaves only the remaining parts of you that was in him from the beginning even this old body is changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye the real you the real you on that morning friends you're going to be so happy with the real you and can I say to you today that that's really been the real you all along and I know you haven't felt that way but that that's how God has looked at you you're going to be on Resurrection morning the real you that he always saw you as Hallelujah it connects us to our origin and it connects us to our destination back into eternity before I ever made a mistake before I ever came into this life and I stand glorified in his presence it positions me now I'm going to close with this amen it positions me now now therefore there there is no condemnation possible to them which are in Christ Jesus it positions me now in Heavenly places with Christ right while I'm struggling along here yes amen I'm already now there is no condemnation therefore to them which are in Christ amen you love the Lord I got too much to get to we're going to let you stand God bless you stand with
