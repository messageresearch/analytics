[4:40] um
[4:40] wanna
[4:43] turn to
[4:45] um
[4:46] Proverbs 22 in verse 3
[4:49] start off with
[4:51] um
[4:52] wait for there we go
[4:54] um I'm gonna try to go kind of quick
[4:56] because I'm afraid I'm gonna run out of
[4:58] time
[4:59] um it says a prudent man for seeth the
[5:02] evil
[5:03] and hideth himself put the simple pass
[5:06] on and are punished
[5:08] and you all can be seated
[5:10] um
[5:11] so I want to
[5:14] I want to talk a little bit about
[5:16] um
[5:17] maybe as a as a parable
[5:20] um as a type
[5:21] um investment and and
[5:24] sort of money and and things like that
[5:28] um we know brother Brands many times
[5:29] talked about you know God has an economy
[5:31] and and um thing and and whatnot and
[5:34] that how that we would invest in that
[5:36] economy and that there would be there
[5:38] would be Returns on that investment
[5:40] um
[5:41] but I wanted to I wanted to take a story
[5:44] and and maybe tell a little bit of a
[5:46] story and I'm sure it's one that many if
[5:48] not all of you are familiar with because
[5:50] I'm sure many if not all of you have
[5:51] lived through it in some way or another
[5:52] and um that's the story of 2008.
[5:57] um
[6:00] that that story uh the farther you look
[6:04] into it the more I mean use as a human
[6:05] not necessarily looking at it
[6:07] spiritually but just as a person and to
[6:09] and to look at that it really is a head
[6:11] scratcher on how
[6:13] there wasn't a civil war over that
[6:16] um because of the amount of just
[6:18] corruption that happened there was you
[6:20] know you had people who
[6:21] for any of you who aren't really aware
[6:24] of how that whole financial disaster
[6:27] happened effectively you had Banks
[6:29] issuing people mortgages that they knew
[6:31] couldn't be paid back those the people
[6:33] who got the mortgages they were Bad
[6:36] Mortgages that they knew there was no
[6:37] chance those people were ever going to
[6:39] be able to pay that mortgage a lot of
[6:40] times it's because they had effectively
[6:42] lied to the people about what that
[6:44] mortgage entailed
[6:46] um you know they didn't read the fine
[6:48] print or didn't disclose the fine print
[6:50] that you know in three years the
[6:52] mortgage payment was going to go from
[6:53] 900 a month to 7 000 a month
[6:55] um and because and they made that that
[6:58] they sold the people those mortgage
[7:00] because they knew they were going to
[7:01] turn around and sell that mortgage to an
[7:03] investment Bank
[7:04] who isn't going to take that
[7:06] bad mortgage and package it up into a
[7:08] bigger product called the
[7:09] mortgage-backed security where they take
[7:11] thousands of mortgages put them in a big
[7:13] box and sell them to a pension fund
[7:15] because the pension fund says well who
[7:17] doesn't pay their mortgage everybody
[7:18] pays their mortgage this box of several
[7:21] thousand mortgages isn't going to fail
[7:22] and it's going to pay certain percent of
[7:24] interest every year and and people's
[7:26] pensions were backed by this
[7:28] um you had stock people in the stock
[7:31] market who were using these Securities
[7:33] mortgage-backed Securities which were
[7:35] the ratings agencies said were as secure
[7:37] as the federal government AAA couldn't
[7:40] fail
[7:41] and they use those as collateral and
[7:44] invested in the stock market with loans
[7:46] that were backed by as collateral these
[7:49] uh securities
[7:51] well
[7:53] the problem is the Securities were junk
[7:57] nobody knew it
[7:59] but they were junk they were going to
[8:01] fail it was guaranteed it was
[8:02] mathematically guaranteed to fail
[8:04] and yet
[8:06] everybody was resting on this there's
[8:08] huge sex I mean people had had paid 30
[8:12] 40 years into Pension funds and and IRAs
[8:14] and 401ks that were backed by garbage
[8:17] and they had no idea
[8:19] there was no way to know for the average
[8:21] person right
[8:24] and you know for us simple-minded people
[8:26] who you know we're just doing the Dave
[8:27] Ramsey thing and paying into our IRA and
[8:29] and you know doing what we think is
[8:32] prudent we're simple people and yet we
[8:34] get punished for it
[8:36] right because the reality is in a
[8:39] society that is completely eaten up with
[8:41] corruption and when you're paying into
[8:43] an economy and you're investing into
[8:45] economy that has corrupt all the way to
[8:47] its core
[8:48] it's gonna collapse there isn't there
[8:51] isn't a way that's not going to collapse
[8:55] right
[8:57] um
[9:02] and so I wanna
[9:04] you know and we like I said we at the
[9:05] end of all this where you had people who
[9:08] who
[9:09] were in fact we're committing fraud they
[9:11] were outright committing fraud because
[9:12] they were taking these bad Securities
[9:14] you know these Bad Bad Mortgages that
[9:16] they knew were going to fail and they're
[9:17] putting them in Securities they knew
[9:18] were going to fail and then you think
[9:20] well how do they rating agencies
[9:22] put their name on that and say well
[9:23] these are AAA they're as good as As Good
[9:25] As It Gets
[9:26] well it's because they committed fraud
[9:29] outright like that's not a that's not a
[9:31] not conspiracy theory that's just go
[9:33] read the New York Times They openly talk
[9:35] about it they straight up committed
[9:36] fraud and they allowed to they lied to
[9:38] everybody
[9:39] um and at the end of it nobody went to
[9:41] jail
[9:42] nobody nobody there was one guy out of
[9:45] thousands of Bankers they took one guy
[9:47] and threw him under the bus and he got a
[9:49] couple years in the clink
[9:50] and he was doing exactly what everybody
[9:52] else was doing
[9:53] and and not only that not only did
[9:56] nobody go to jail
[9:57] they went to Congress and Congress paid
[10:01] off all their debts all their bad debts
[10:03] on the checkbook of the American people
[10:05] and they still got their bonuses
[10:08] out of American tax dollars
[10:10] and you think wow this is horrifying how
[10:14] did this happen in a previous era
[10:18] if people would have committed that
[10:19] level of theft and that level of fraud
[10:21] they would have been executed like
[10:23] straight up I mean they used to hang
[10:25] horse thieves you think they wouldn't
[10:26] hang people for for defrauding people
[10:29] but we're living in a in an era like and
[10:31] so to the human mind you think well how
[10:33] does this happen how does how does this
[10:35] level of corruption happen
[10:38] and nothing nothing no one is punished
[10:40] there's no recompense there's no justice
[10:42] well
[10:44] this is this is this is Satan's economy
[10:48] what did you expect did you think there
[10:49] would be Justice in Satan's economy
[10:52] right did you think there would be
[10:54] Justice for for those people who who
[10:57] defraud people in Satan's economy there
[11:00] isn't any justice these people nobody's
[11:01] nobody's going to
[11:03] to um to make right exactly
[11:08] and so that's why that's why we take
[11:11] scriptures like Matthew 19-21 where
[11:15] Jesus says lay not up for yourselves
[11:17] treasure upon Earth where moth and rust
[11:19] doth corrupt and where thieves break
[11:21] through and steal
[11:23] but lay up for yourselves Treasures in
[11:25] heaven heaven or neither moth nor rust
[11:29] death corrupt and where thieves do not
[11:31] break through nor steal nor corrupt Wall
[11:34] Street Executives to fraud you
[11:36] um
[11:37] for where your treasure is there will
[11:39] your heart be also
[11:41] because the problem I mean if you think
[11:43] about it I'm not saying that you
[11:44] shouldn't put money into your retirement
[11:46] fund you should right it's just prudent
[11:49] to do that but if you're putting your
[11:52] spiritual investment into that if that's
[11:54] where your security is and that's where
[11:56] well I'll be all right I'm doing all the
[11:58] right things and I'm I'm and I'm pretty
[12:00] smart guy and I'll I'll depend on my arm
[12:02] of the flesh to make all the right
[12:04] investment moves
[12:05] well you can do that but it's only a
[12:08] matter of time before that thing blows
[12:09] up and you're out on the street right
[12:11] it's only a matter of time before you're
[12:12] gonna need something a little bit more
[12:13] than the arm of the Flesh and so you
[12:14] should be investing in something a
[12:16] little bit more than what you can do
[12:19] um
[12:22] and
[12:23] the other side of that story and this is
[12:25] the kind of the side of the story that
[12:26] maybe less people are familiar with
[12:28] about the 2008 story is there was a very
[12:31] small number of people
[12:32] very small number of people
[12:35] um who were smart enough
[12:37] they were maybe it was just good
[12:41] circumstances but they actually realized
[12:42] what was going on
[12:44] um one guy very famously I'm sure you
[12:46] could all Google them if you've never
[12:47] heard of him by the name of Michael
[12:48] burry
[12:50] um who ran a small really small uh
[12:52] investment firm and he realized that the
[12:54] mortgage-backed security thing was a
[12:55] racket he realized they were all it was
[12:57] a lot of bad debt because he did what
[12:59] somehow nobody else did and just read
[13:02] all the mortgages went I mean most
[13:04] people can't even be bothered to read
[13:06] their own mortgage payment when they
[13:07] sign it when you got a stack of
[13:08] documents as I he read thousands of them
[13:10] and realized that they were all bad and
[13:13] he could predict to within like a couple
[13:16] of months when the entire economy was
[13:18] going to collapse because he knew when
[13:19] all their their terms were going to come
[13:21] due
[13:23] and so he did the unthinkable
[13:25] and he did what he in in sort of Wall
[13:29] Street terms he did what's called
[13:30] shorting the housing market right he
[13:33] went to a bunch of Banks and basically
[13:35] made made up contracts with them
[13:38] um
[13:39] where they would pay him if the
[13:42] Securities failed
[13:45] and they would pay him out to the tune
[13:46] of like
[13:47] 25 times his initial investment
[13:50] right and they were willing to do this
[13:52] because they're like well it's not going
[13:53] to fail they're Triple A rated if these
[13:55] things failed then everything fails
[13:57] they're not going to fail and on top of
[13:59] that he's going to pay us like 75 000 a
[14:02] month for as long as this contract is is
[14:04] good as far as they're concerned I mean
[14:06] he's just offered to pay them 75 000 a
[14:08] month just to donate it to their Bank
[14:09] sure why not
[14:11] right absolutely you know we'll take
[14:14] your money
[14:15] and so he does it he goes to all these
[14:17] different banks and gets all these
[14:18] contracts
[14:19] and he go and by the way of course he he
[14:21] decides to collect coffee cups with
[14:23] their logo on it they have you know
[14:24] sitting on the counter because he wanted
[14:26] a record that these Banks would still
[14:27] exist in 10 years
[14:29] because they weren't going to exist in
[14:31] 10 years and he knew that
[14:34] and
[14:36] the entire time and so he started this
[14:38] in like 2004.
[14:40] and for the next three years he's
[14:42] shelling out thousands and thousands and
[14:45] thousands of dollars every month to keep
[14:47] these
[14:48] to keep into the in into his investment
[14:51] because he knew at some point in 2007
[14:54] late 2007 it mathematically has to fail
[14:59] and the entire time his investment his
[15:01] investors were freaking out and calling
[15:03] him and saying everybody was calling him
[15:05] insane the banks were calling him crazy
[15:07] and and he had Wall Street guys trying
[15:11] to put pressure on him to sell because
[15:12] they knew what what was going on and
[15:14] they knew he was going to take their
[15:15] shirt
[15:16] but
[15:18] you know so they're trying to put
[15:19] pressure on him to collapse
[15:21] and but he knew his position and he he
[15:23] refused he had to liquidate basically
[15:25] his entire company just to hang on to
[15:27] those contracts
[15:28] but he knew he sold off of everything
[15:30] everything else got sold off right he
[15:33] sold all that he had because he knew
[15:34] there was this one particular pearl of
[15:35] great price that was going to pay out
[15:36] phenomenally at some point
[15:40] but there was a lot of fear uncertainty
[15:41] and doubt that was crushing him
[15:43] and every day he's got to go to work
[15:45] with a knot in his stomach for years
[15:48] for three or four years he has to have
[15:50] faith that he knows that this that the
[15:53] society around him is going to collapse
[15:55] but he's got a way out
[15:58] and Christians can't hold on for like
[16:01] three days
[16:02] right
[16:04] we'll like pray for something
[16:06] and we we know we've invested in God's
[16:09] economy we know we've we've gone Against
[16:11] the Grain we've gone against what
[16:12] society says and like three days of
[16:14] pressure and we're like ah okay fine and
[16:17] we'll just we'll just walk away from our
[16:18] faith
[16:20] this dude is hanging on for like three
[16:21] or four years with people calling him
[16:24] screaming at him saying we're gonna sue
[16:25] you we're gonna throw you in jail
[16:28] and he's like no I'm not gonna sell I'm
[16:31] not gonna I'm not gonna give up
[16:33] and and we're sitting here looking at
[16:35] you know
[16:38] brother bran says you know when what you
[16:40] see in the in the you know the natural
[16:41] types of spiritual
[16:43] this is a lot of different ways we kind
[16:45] of as a shorthand say the natural types
[16:46] of spiritual and like I said previously
[16:48] a lot of times we think oh natural types
[16:50] of spiritual that means the natural is
[16:51] like a metaphor for the spiritual it's
[16:54] not exactly what that means what it
[16:55] means is the natural is
[16:59] a shadow of the spiritual as in what
[17:02] you're seeing in the natural is
[17:03] literally in some way a direct
[17:05] representation of what's happening in
[17:07] the spiritual so when you see in this in
[17:09] in the natural world
[17:11] you see a massive economic collapse on
[17:14] some level this is an indication of on
[17:16] the spiritual world there's a spiritual
[17:18] collapse that's happening
[17:20] and what happened in that same time
[17:22] frame
[17:23] you know
[17:25] you have people
[17:28] because the you know the 2008 collapse
[17:29] happened over the course of like 30 or
[17:30] 40 years it happened very slowly and
[17:32] then very suddenly
[17:34] right it took 30 40 Years of fraud to
[17:37] get to that point
[17:39] and over that same time frame you have
[17:41] this the the social moral collapse of
[17:44] America right and the and the the eight
[17:48] the people that were supposed to be in
[17:49] place who are supposed to call out the
[17:51] fraud you know the rating agencies were
[17:54] in on it and they said you know because
[17:56] afterwards they went to the the people
[17:58] who were supposed to say well why did
[17:59] you rate these AAA they were garbage why
[18:01] did you rate them AAA well they said
[18:02] well because we were getting paid to do
[18:03] it and if we didn't if we didn't
[18:06] rate these what they asked for they
[18:08] would have gone to our competitors well
[18:10] how many churches are going well we
[18:11] can't call out the the nonsense of
[18:12] society because if we do our
[18:14] congregation will go to our competitor
[18:15] and we'll lose our meal ticket
[18:18] you know how and so we've have this
[18:20] massive
[18:21] this massive so like
[18:25] spiritual economy implosion
[18:28] absolute collapse
[18:31] and everybody's wondering
[18:34] well
[18:36] why right why does this why does this
[18:39] collapse
[18:40] you know most people don't understand
[18:44] I I
[18:46] read
[18:48] um
[18:50] I I think that on some level
[18:53] in in the same way you know you have all
[18:55] these these mortgages that people bought
[18:57] that were bad bad debt
[18:59] and it was it's the secret underlying
[19:01] thing that nobody's paying attention to
[19:02] but it's actually the thing that's going
[19:03] to fail right
[19:07] I've on there's a lot of different ways
[19:09] you could kind of approach this but I
[19:10] think I think I like the way Solomon
[19:12] writes this in Ecclesiastes
[19:14] this is Ecclesiastes chapter six one
[19:16] through seven this is a different
[19:18] translation than King James because
[19:19] Ecclesiastes is kind of hard it's kind
[19:22] of clear as mud sometimes because of the
[19:23] translation but
[19:25] um I like this the way that it says this
[19:27] um says
[19:30] there's another evil I have seen under
[19:33] the sun
[19:35] and it weighs heavily upon mankind
[19:38] God gives a man riches wealth and honor
[19:40] so that he lacks nothing his heart
[19:43] desires
[19:44] but God does not allow him to enjoy them
[19:47] instead a stranger will enjoy them this
[19:51] is futile and a grievous affliction
[19:55] a man May father a hundred children and
[19:57] live for many years yet no matter how
[19:59] long he lives if he is unsatisfied with
[20:01] his prosperity and does not even receive
[20:03] a proper burial I say that a stillborn
[20:05] child is better off than he
[20:08] for stillborn child enters in futility
[20:10] into Parts in darkness and his name is
[20:13] shrouded in obscurity
[20:16] the child though neither seeing the son
[20:18] nor knowing anything
[20:21] has more rest
[20:23] than that man
[20:25] even if he lives a thousand years twice
[20:27] over but fails to enjoy his Prosperity
[20:29] do not all go to the same place
[20:33] all a man's labor is for his mouth yet
[20:35] his appetite is never satisfied
[20:39] and this is the underlying failure of
[20:41] modern society this is the underlying
[20:44] thing that no modern society is not
[20:48] taking into consideration that they can
[20:50] chase they can chase the world they can
[20:52] chase riches they can chase Fame they
[20:55] can chase whatever it is
[20:57] but if there's no there's no security on
[21:00] the spiritual side there's no they've
[21:02] not invested in anything
[21:04] concrete right they're not invested in
[21:06] anything spiritual they're not invested
[21:08] in their soul
[21:09] they might as well have been stillborn
[21:12] for all the good it's going to do them
[21:13] right if anything the stillborn would
[21:15] have been better because at least they
[21:16] don't got to live 75 years of misery
[21:18] right
[21:20] you know I mean you're gonna you think
[21:23] well this is Satan's Eden
[21:25] well what kind of Eden is Satan going to
[21:27] make nothing that anyone's gonna have a
[21:29] whole lot of fun in not not permanently
[21:31] right you know you think you think uh
[21:33] you know all these people who chase
[21:36] if you're out there chasing chasing um
[21:40] you know a party and a chasing a good
[21:42] time and chasing all this stuff and
[21:44] that's what you live for then what does
[21:46] that say about your life when you're not
[21:47] chasing that but when you don't have
[21:49] that yeah right it means your life is
[21:51] nothing outside of that high
[21:54] right
[21:56] but so I guess what I'm trying to
[21:59] you know in so many words trying to
[22:02] try to present to you
[22:04] is the spiritual investment opportunity
[22:06] of Christ right
[22:09] when when you're gonna when you're gonna
[22:11] short this evil spiritual Society of
[22:15] Satan's Eden that means you have to sell
[22:16] off of everything right if you have any
[22:19] anything that you have that's not
[22:21] invested in in
[22:23] the Kingdom of Heaven is going to burn
[22:26] down so don't have anything invested in
[22:28] that
[22:29] pull out of that cut off all of that
[22:32] invest in the Kingdom of Heaven because
[22:34] that's what's going to pay out at the
[22:36] end of the day and this is the reason
[22:38] why this is such a good investment
[22:40] opportunity
[22:41] folks it pays dividends right when
[22:44] you're invested in a stock that pays
[22:45] dividends that means you get a check
[22:46] every month right it pays you it pays
[22:49] you back
[22:50] well when you invest in the Kingdom of
[22:52] Heaven there's dividends that get paid
[22:53] out right there's healing that gets paid
[22:56] out right brother said that healing
[22:58] Divine Healing is the earnest on your
[23:00] body change right what does that mean it
[23:02] means there's a body change somewhere
[23:03] over there and to prove to you that
[23:05] there is body change
[23:06] he'll change a little bit of your body
[23:07] right now
[23:09] right the same Divine creative power
[23:11] that created a perfect perfect body for
[23:13] you to live in will perfect your body
[23:15] here on some level you know and that and
[23:19] like we said you know the last time I I
[23:21] ministered your spiritual body and your
[23:23] flesh body aren't so different right you
[23:26] have mind battles you have spiritual
[23:27] battles in your mind of depression of
[23:29] anxiety of addiction of of whatever that
[23:31] thing is that you're trying to to free
[23:33] yourself from that thing that's got you
[23:35] got a chain around your neck
[23:37] there's healing for that right there is
[23:41] healing for that but you have to be
[23:42] invested in that economy you can't you
[23:44] know to be invested
[23:46] I had a um a uh
[23:49] where I work as a a maintenance guy
[23:52] property manager um at an apartment
[23:54] complex
[23:55] there were during it was uh I was there
[23:58] while they changed ownership
[24:00] and um
[24:02] the vice president came down to kind of
[24:04] Overlook at the Overlook the property
[24:06] and and one of the things that he told
[24:07] me he's like you know
[24:08] when you if you're gonna actually
[24:11] basically have to Soul guy this property
[24:12] I'm the only person keeping the whole
[24:14] thing floating he's like look if you're
[24:15] going to do this you have to be invested
[24:17] in this it's like I need you to invest
[24:19] like I what they call as emotional
[24:21] buy-in
[24:22] right you have to put a little bit of
[24:25] your
[24:26] emotions on the line for this property
[24:28] because otherwise you're not going to
[24:30] have the motivation to do the hard work
[24:31] that's going to take to do this it's
[24:34] really hard right and if
[24:38] so many times where we don't buy in all
[24:42] the way right well you know we we we're
[24:45] we're afraid that it's gonna it's not
[24:47] gonna work out or something like that or
[24:49] we're looking for a plan B
[24:52] you know it's like well I'll pray about
[24:54] it and if it don't get better I'll just
[24:55] go to the doctor
[24:57] it's like well okay well you should have
[24:58] gone to the doctor first he might have
[25:00] been able to help you because if that's
[25:01] the level of your faith I don't know
[25:02] that your prayer is going to do a whole
[25:03] lot
[25:04] right because you have a plan B your
[25:07] faith is obviously in the doctor
[25:08] otherwise it wouldn't have come up
[25:10] right now you can pray for the the Lord
[25:12] will be with a doctor that's fine right
[25:15] absolutely because that's where your
[25:16] faith is your faith is in the doctor
[25:18] and and we know that the Lord heals
[25:20] through doctors that's I mean the Lord
[25:22] anoints doctors
[25:25] but that I mean so if that's what your
[25:28] faith is that's fine
[25:30] but if you're looking for a miracle then
[25:32] you can't have a plan B
[25:33] right miracles happen for people who
[25:35] don't have options
[25:37] right miracles happen for people who
[25:39] that's what makes it a miracle
[25:41] right if it's if it's
[25:43] and so that's I mean if I could
[25:47] kind of run out of time here
[25:50] um
[25:51] and so I I guess I would would just kind
[25:54] of like to
[25:55] um
[26:00] uh
[26:02] I'll wrap up with with this
[26:04] um
[26:06] you know like I said so many times you
[26:09] have
[26:09] when you have somebody who who sees the
[26:11] sees what's going on like that the man
[26:14] who who held even though everybody was
[26:15] trying to trying to get him to to shake
[26:17] there was a moment where
[26:20] the time frame that he knew everything
[26:21] was going to blow up actually came
[26:24] and all of his investors are like okay
[26:26] man we we we stuck with you until now
[26:29] because you said it was everything was
[26:31] going to fail right here
[26:33] and all the headlines come out and he
[26:35] was right all the headlines that right
[26:36] within those couple months all the
[26:37] headlines come out that all the
[26:40] mortgages are failing
[26:41] but somehow
[26:43] the Securities that
[26:45] those mortgages were packed into
[26:47] didn't fail in fact they went up in
[26:49] price
[26:51] and you're thinking well how does that
[26:53] happen right how did how did they make
[26:55] that work well like I said the secret
[26:57] ingredient was fraud
[26:59] um that's what that's what that's what
[27:01] why that happened it's because the
[27:03] ratings agencies just refused to devalue
[27:05] the the Securities even though they knew
[27:07] beyond any shot of a doubt that they
[27:09] those mortgages were defaulting
[27:12] and so here he is in a time frame where
[27:13] he made a prediction that at this time
[27:16] his his investment was going to pay off
[27:19] but it's not paying off because there
[27:21] was fraud right
[27:24] but he still had to hold on through that
[27:26] and he did he did manage to hold on
[27:27] through it
[27:28] it took a couple months but so many
[27:30] times there's there's with us whatever
[27:32] it is that you're praying for whatever
[27:33] is that you're needing Deliverance for
[27:35] whatever it is that you've invested in
[27:37] you've invested your faith in you've
[27:39] hung on and you said you know no matter
[27:40] how much doubt the devil throws that
[27:43] you've hung on and then you think
[27:44] there's gonna be a moment okay well I'm
[27:45] gonna break through and this is going to
[27:46] be it and then it doesn't happen
[27:48] that's the sticking point that's where
[27:51] you really gotta hold that's where you
[27:53] gotta that's the moment where you gotta
[27:54] go okay
[27:56] the secret ingredient here is fraud
[27:58] right the devil has defrauded me
[28:01] right my faith says that this is going
[28:03] to happen and because it's not happening
[28:05] it's because somebody lied and it's the
[28:07] devil
[28:08] right and so that's when you got to hold
[28:09] through
[28:11] because there's a promise and I want to
[28:12] I and I'll and I'll I'll wrap up with
[28:15] this
[28:16] As Romans 6 15.
[28:21] um
[28:22] and verse 22
[28:24] and it says but now being made free from
[28:28] sin
[28:29] and become servants to God
[28:32] ye have found your fruit unto holiness
[28:35] and the end everlasting life
[28:39] for the wages of sin is death but the
[28:41] gift of God is eternal life through
[28:43] Jesus Christ Our Lord
[28:45] and don't forget that even though the
[28:48] entire world has been racking up a
[28:50] massive bill of death right they've been
[28:53] playing with sin
[28:55] and you got to pay the piper eventually
[28:59] because you've you've you've sold off of
[29:01] that off of that market you're not
[29:04] subject to that you there's a there's a
[29:07] gift of eternal life that's waiting for
[29:08] you that has interest now
[29:12] that you have access to
[29:15] and so that's I think we're out of time
[29:17] now
[29:18] we'll stand and have a word of Prayer
[29:23] Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank
[29:25] you for this opportunity that maybe that
[29:27] my
[29:28] jumbled and mixed up words father that
[29:31] would be able to
[29:33] help somebody Lord and it's all I would
[29:35] ask for that if somebody could be helped
[29:37] that they would their faith would maybe
[29:38] hold on a little bit longer whatever it
[29:41] is that they're they're praying for
[29:42] father that whatever they've
[29:45] whatever they've invested their faith in
[29:47] Lord that no matter what kind of lies
[29:49] that the devil would tell them Lord that
[29:50] you would
[29:52] you would carry them through Lord that
[29:54] it would be an encouragement that they
[29:56] would be able to hold on just a little
[29:57] bit longer
[29:59] that that that big payoff Lord is coming
[30:01] that we know that your kingdom is going
[30:03] to be made manifest father
[30:05] so we ask these things in your holy and
[30:07] precious name Jesus Christ amen
[30:23] [Music]
