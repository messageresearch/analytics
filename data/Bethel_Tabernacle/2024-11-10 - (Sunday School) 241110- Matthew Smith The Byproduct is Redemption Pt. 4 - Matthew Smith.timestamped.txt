[0:02] oh gracious father Lord we come before
[0:04] you this morning yet again humbly
[0:06] requesting your presence Lord that we
[0:09] would come before you not
[0:12] with a hotti attitude or with an
[0:14] attitude of of personal uh Enlightenment
[0:19] but Lord we would come with an attitude
[0:20] of a thirst of a hunger of a recognition
[0:23] that we are nothing without you lord
[0:25] know a recognition that we would have
[0:27] nothing to say or nothing to hear if it
[0:29] weren't for you you for your anointing
[0:32] father and so we ask you would come down
[0:33] and anoint this Sunday school that it
[0:35] would be your presence speaking through
[0:38] through me father that the people would
[0:40] uh be in the anointing to open their
[0:42] hearts to hear that you what you would
[0:44] have to say that Lord that you would
[0:45] help me to step out of the way and that
[0:47] there would be no uh personal feeling or
[0:49] attitude in in what I would have to say
[0:52] but but Lord that it'd be you speaking
[0:54] through me and that it'd be your
[0:55] attitude and and your feeling and your
[0:57] emotion convey to the people that we
[1:00] would all be able to be uplifted by the
[1:03] revelation of your word and we ask these
[1:05] things in the name of the precious Lord
[1:07] and Savior the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11] amen um we want to continue the thought
[1:14] that we've been um going through there's
[1:18] no shouldn't have need of a PowerPoint
[1:19] this morning
[1:22] um um uh but I do want to
[1:27] read um
[1:32] uh come up here all right let's go ahead
[1:34] and as a just as a as a scripture we'll
[1:36] read Genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[1:40] again um continuing to emphasize the
[1:44] point sort of the foundation of this
[1:46] whole
[1:49] topic
[1:52] um Genesis chapter 1 and
[1:56] verse
[1:58] 26 um and God said let us make man in
[2:01] our image after our likeness and let
[2:03] them have dominion over the fish of the
[2:05] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[2:06] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[2:09] and over every creeping thing that
[2:10] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[2:12] man in his own
[2:14] image in the image of God created he him
[2:17] male and female created he them and God
[2:19] blessed them and said unto them be
[2:21] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[2:23] Earth and subdue it and have dominion
[2:25] over the fish of the sea and over the
[2:26] fowl of the air and over every living
[2:28] thing that moveth upon the Earth Earth
[2:30] y'all can be
[2:32] seated um so I I I want to
[2:37] um
[2:40] uh so I want to just as a maybe a recap
[2:44] or or a reiteration of um something we
[2:47] discussed last Sunday um and I and I
[2:51] want to just again um sort of emphasize
[2:54] a point um that I had made concerning um
[2:58] how um um that it would be a a failure
[3:02] of the duty of a minister to
[3:04] not
[3:06] um preach the word in its entirety for
[3:10] the for fear of uh conflict or fear of
[3:13] of maybe hurting feelings or something
[3:15] like that um you know it it just sort of
[3:20] kind of emphasized that I once heard a
[3:23] long time ago um that Napoleon when
[3:26] speaking of War said that if you see
[3:27] your enemy making a mistake do not
[3:29] interrupt them
[3:31] okay um this is and it's kind of obvious
[3:36] and intuitive but likewise when you see
[3:39] your friends making
[3:41] mistakes and and walking into something
[3:43] dangerous or walking into a trap to
[3:45] stand by and and sit idly by and say
[3:48] nothing is a betrayal it is to treat
[3:51] them as an enemy okay and it it behooves
[3:56] all of us and and and hopefully you know
[3:59] we we may move into some of this but it
[4:01] it behooves everybody that when we
[4:06] know the way that God intended Humanity
[4:09] to live we know how God intended people
[4:11] to to um behave and and there was
[4:15] there's a standard that the word expects
[4:17] Christians to live up to to not tell
[4:21] people that for fear of conflict is a
[4:24] betrayal okay it is a it is a you do
[4:28] them wrong you treat them as an enemy
[4:30] um and I would I the the note that I
[4:34] wrote down goes I would rather be seen
[4:38] as maybe um uh harsh or or um or or or
[4:45] uh legalistic perhaps I'd rather be seen
[4:47] as as
[4:49] legalistic than to betray my friends and
[4:52] my loved ones with polite
[4:54] non-confrontational
[4:55] silence okay to to for fear because we
[5:00] know what the word of of God is to to be
[5:03] uh shy about saying it for fear of
[5:05] hurting someone's feelings um it it it
[5:08] is it is wrong and it is complicit okay
[5:11] it is complicit in the Trap that they
[5:13] are walking into so um just I also
[5:18] wanted to kind of refresh or or to to
[5:22] recognize to to reiterate the point
[5:24] about how um men and women are different
[5:28] we have different therefore there are
[5:30] different the the word is the the only
[5:31] standard but it applies to men and women
[5:33] differently because men and women are
[5:35] different okay male and female created
[5:37] he
[5:38] them okay um not you know gender binary
[5:43] or anything like that it is there's male
[5:46] and female and God expects males and
[5:48] females to behave accordingly and
[5:49] they're going to be treated accordingly
[5:51] they're being held to their standard
[5:53] accordingly
[5:55] um and we talked about how with the uh
[6:00] you know we talk about how in in in the
[6:02] scripture in Paul the Apostle Paul
[6:04] taught explicitly that a for a woman to
[6:06] cut her hair is dishonor to her headship
[6:09] and if she dishonors her headship she
[6:11] has no authority to even pray okay that
[6:13] God cannot hear her prayer and likewise
[6:15] if a man acts dishonorably and dishonors
[6:18] himself as headship and does not uphold
[6:20] his uh uh mandate then he was also cut
[6:25] off because because this is the standard
[6:28] of Holiness that they are to be upheld
[6:30] hold themselves to right that that uh
[6:33] men and women are there's a single
[6:35] standard of Holiness but it applies to
[6:36] men and women differently depending on
[6:38] their role and because God is Holiness
[6:42] God has a holy God he has a holy
[6:44] presence to enter into that presence to
[6:46] commune with God to pray requires that
[6:49] you be holy right there you can't be
[6:52] Unholy and expect have an audience with
[6:54] god with any kind of authority so
[6:55] therefore you have to live up to a
[6:57] Holiness standard okay okay to have that
[7:01] Authority with God in his presence and
[7:04] so
[7:06] um uh and we tied this back to um The
[7:11] Book of Exodus when it speaks of the
[7:15] token I want to go ahead and um turn
[7:17] there if we would to Exodus 12 and verse
[7:21] 1
[7:43] and we're going to read to verse 13
[7:45] we'll start at verse one it says the
[7:46] Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the
[7:49] land of Egypt saying this month shall be
[7:51] unto you the beginning of months it
[7:53] shall be the first month of the year to
[7:55] you speak ye unto all the congregation
[7:58] of Israel saying in the 10th day of this
[8:00] month they shall take to them every man
[8:02] a lamb according to the house of their
[8:04] fathers a lamb for a house and if the
[8:07] household be too little for the lamb let
[8:08] him and his neighbor next unto his house
[8:11] take it according to the number of the
[8:12] souls every man according to his eating
[8:15] shall make your count for the lamb the
[8:18] lamb shall be without blemish a male of
[8:20] the first year you shall take it out
[8:22] from the Sheep um or from the goats and
[8:25] you shall keep it until the uh 14th day
[8:27] of the same month and the whole assembly
[8:29] believe the congregation of Israel shall
[8:30] kill it in the evening and they shall
[8:32] take of the blood and strike it on the
[8:35] two sides of the post and on the upper
[8:36] doorstep doorpost of the houses wherein
[8:39] they shall eat it and they shall eat the
[8:41] Flesh in that in that night roast with
[8:44] fire and unleavened bread and with
[8:47] bitter herbs they shall eat it um eat
[8:50] not of it raw nor sodden um at all with
[8:53] water but roast with fire its head with
[8:55] its legs and with the pertinence thereof
[8:57] and he shall not and you shall let
[9:00] nothing of it remain until the morning
[9:03] and that which remaineth of it until the
[9:04] morning shall be burnt with fire and
[9:06] thus shall ye eat it with your loins
[9:09] girded and your shoes on your feet and
[9:11] your staff in your hand and you shall
[9:12] eat it in haste it is the Lord's
[9:15] Passover for I will pass through the
[9:17] land of Egypt this night and will Smite
[9:19] all the firstborn in the land of Egypt
[9:20] both men and beasts and the and against
[9:23] all the gods of Egypt I will execute
[9:25] judgment I am the Lord and the blood
[9:27] shall be to be to you for a token upon
[9:31] the houses wherein you are and when I
[9:32] see the blood I will pass over you and
[9:34] the plague shall not be upon you to
[9:36] destroy you when I smite the land of
[9:39] Egypt amen
[9:41] okay so like I said last time there was
[9:46] a process to this okay it was not as
[9:49] simple as well we're going to kill a
[9:51] lamb and and put its Blood on the door
[9:53] and then that's the end of it okay there
[9:56] was you had to bring the lamb into the
[9:59] home right and and I want to I am tying
[10:02] this back to remember back to fathers
[10:05] and husbands being leaders in their home
[10:09] okay this is where we're going with this
[10:11] that husbands and fathers is that in
[10:12] order we talk about so often we talk
[10:15] about you know the me the token message
[10:16] that brother Brandon preached about how
[10:18] when you have things come against your
[10:19] family that you can apply the token and
[10:21] and stand against it right you can hold
[10:22] the death angel at Bay because you've
[10:24] applied the token well what does that
[10:26] mean exactly okay it is not as simple as
[10:29] was saying well I believe Jesus was the
[10:31] Savior and there's blood over my door
[10:33] there more than that okay that you had
[10:35] to bring the lamb into the home it had
[10:37] to be roast with fire which I would like
[10:39] to point out so you have huh you have
[10:41] the body of the lamb in direct contact
[10:44] with or prepared for consumption by the
[10:47] fire of the Holy Spirit okay it's there
[10:50] there was there was a a a a process to
[10:53] that it had to be prepared a certain
[10:54] kind of way you couldn't just pan fry it
[10:55] in some denominational frying pan right
[10:58] you couldn't boil it in some man-made
[11:00] Soup pot right it had to be roast direct
[11:04] fire to flesh contact right that would
[11:07] prepare it in the appropriate way for
[11:09] consumption you had to take the life it
[11:11] because it wasn't just a the blood of a
[11:14] lamb that was the chemicals on the door
[11:17] post isn't wasn't the trick right that
[11:21] that didn't wasn't going to do it for
[11:22] any for anybody what it was was the life
[11:25] that was in that lamb is now been
[11:28] consumed through the Flesh of that lamb
[11:29] into the person in the house right the
[11:32] people have taken the life of that lamb
[11:34] into themselves right it is now Chang to
[11:37] them their body will then manifest the
[11:39] life that was in that lamb
[11:42] okay not only that but you know there
[11:46] was there so there's a but it mentions
[11:48] the unleavened bread right this speaks
[11:51] that they had to clean their home you
[11:54] know it goes into into later detail and
[11:56] I'm I'm just going to for the sake of
[11:58] having 25 minutes not going to get into
[12:00] um but you know there's there's a
[12:02] cleaning of the home that's required you
[12:04] can't have Levan in the home you can't
[12:06] have frivolous sin in the home you can't
[12:08] have things that are uh you know blatant
[12:11] disregard for the standard of Holiness
[12:13] in your home and expect to have a
[12:15] token it doesn't work that way okay and
[12:19] so so many times you have heads of
[12:21] households you have fathers and husbands
[12:24] who will as a father and a husband be
[12:27] leading their household they'll kill
[12:29] lamb and put the do you know put the
[12:30] blood on the on the door they'll uh you
[12:33] know even you know feed on the message
[12:34] of the hour and read their Bible and
[12:36] pray and and pray for Revelation and all
[12:38] these things but they won't be studious
[12:40] about cleaning the leaven out of their
[12:41] homes and as a result what they've done
[12:45] is they've presented a phony token right
[12:48] they did not F go in accordance with the
[12:50] word of God they didn't go in accordance
[12:52] with what they were instructed to do and
[12:55] as a
[12:56] result there's no token there's no
[12:58] protection there's nothing right and so
[13:01] you know so many times people will say
[13:03] well I don't want to uh you know it's
[13:06] difficult it's for fear of conflict for
[13:09] fear of causing offense for fear of
[13:12] having an argument with the family
[13:14] because let's be real no one wants to do
[13:16] that nobody wants to have a hard
[13:18] conversation with the people they love
[13:20] the most that's hard right these are I
[13:23] mean again we talk about this so many
[13:26] times husbands and dads will die for
[13:28] their family right they will it is it is
[13:31] within our nature to do that and so to
[13:33] have conflict with those people that you
[13:34] love so much is so hard it's difficult
[13:38] and so we don't want to do it right we
[13:40] we we we we we kind of shrink back from
[13:44] it but don't
[13:46] forget that your job is to make is to
[13:49] protect the house right the the your
[13:52] your position God has has stood you up
[13:55] to be the leader who's going to say
[13:57] things that aren't necessarily popular
[13:59] sometimes and so often people like well
[14:02] I don't want to say this you know I
[14:03] don't want to enforce a standard of
[14:06] Holiness in my home I don't want to
[14:08] confront my wife or my children on this
[14:11] point because um you know it's going to
[14:13] create an argument well imagine imagine
[14:15] a dad in in Egypt going like well you
[14:18] know we're going to we're going to kill
[14:19] the lamb we're going to put the blood
[14:20] we're going to roast it with fire but we
[14:21] have some yeast rolles with our with our
[14:23] lamb well CU my family loves him so much
[14:26] and it was going to cause a big argument
[14:27] and we're going to fight all night and
[14:28] then everyone's going to go bed angry
[14:29] and then in the morning we're going to
[14:31] be all in out of sorts and we're going
[14:32] to be arguing with each other in the
[14:33] next morning yeah but you'll all be
[14:36] alive right everyone will be
[14:39] alive right I mean what's who's who
[14:43] which dad loves his his and and husband
[14:46] loves his family more the one who went
[14:48] along to go you know go went along to to
[14:50] get along and ended up with a Calamity
[14:53] at the end of it
[14:55] or the one who was a little bit
[14:57] unpopular
[14:59] and and ended up you know saving
[15:02] everybody at the end of the
[15:04] day uh we have a mandate as as men as
[15:08] Leaders to be unpopular sometimes right
[15:13] it's if you're looking for guess what
[15:15] you're supposed to be the type of Christ
[15:17] and Christ isn't always popular in case
[15:20] you hadn't heard matter of fact he was
[15:22] so unpopular they killed him right A lot
[15:25] of times now you do everything in love
[15:28] there's a balance you be belligerent you
[15:30] can be 100% correct in your Doctrine and
[15:33] wrong in your spirit and be a
[15:35] Pharisee okay that's also possible but
[15:39] it it requires the Life of Christ to be
[15:40] operating through that headship in order
[15:44] to to uh present a token that's going to
[15:48] save those children and to say and and
[15:51] and to to uh protect the home against
[15:54] any kind of con like attack of the
[15:57] devil you know
[16:00] um and I can say this you know and I
[16:03] know maybe this if anyone would have a a
[16:06] a
[16:07] a something in their heart to say well
[16:09] who's this guy doesn't have kids talking
[16:11] about being a father well let me tell
[16:12] you this I was the other side of that
[16:16] story okay when people have fear
[16:20] especially when you're dealing with
[16:21] teenagers have fear about I don't want
[16:23] to enforce a standard because I'm afraid
[16:24] it's going to drive my teenagers into
[16:26] the world okay well number one we are
[16:30] taught by the message of the hour that
[16:32] when you apply the token to your home a
[16:33] wayward loved one the token be can be
[16:35] applied and it will go after them no
[16:37] matter where they are okay you apply the
[16:39] token to your home even if it causes
[16:41] enough conflict to create a a temporary
[16:43] separation and the reason for that is no
[16:45] matter even if they leave your home they
[16:46] will not leave your token okay whereas
[16:49] if you compromise your standard and and
[16:51] and and just say well anything goes I
[16:54] don't want to hurt feelings I don't want
[16:55] to create separation then what you'll
[16:56] end up doing is they'll sit there
[16:58] thinking they're okay with no token at
[17:01] all and you've just delivered them to
[17:02] the angel of death on a silver platter
[17:05] okay you you have you have you have they
[17:08] would be better off to separate and and
[17:11] leave the home and still be under your
[17:12] token under your prayers than to remain
[17:15] in the home under a a a uh a a deceptive
[17:19] devil of religion telling them they're
[17:21] okay when they're
[17:23] not okay and I know that from
[17:27] experience I've been there and I've done
[17:29] that okay I've been the one who blew out
[17:34] into the world and it was because of my
[17:36] parents standard that brought me back
[17:39] okay this is you're not going to
[17:40] convince me that doesn't work it was
[17:42] only when I left and realized that I was
[17:45] wrong and needed salvation that I could
[17:46] even repent if I would have sat in a
[17:48] home that told me ah whatever you're
[17:50] you're okay you're living okay it'll be
[17:52] okay Mom and Dad will accept anything by
[17:54] the way Mom and Dad is the first version
[17:55] of God you'll ever see so the way Mom
[17:57] and Dad Act is going to color the way
[17:59] those children see God and and if Mom
[18:02] and Dad are okay with it then
[18:03] subconsciously well then God must be
[18:05] okay with it too no God's not okay with
[18:07] it okay and and the the end result I can
[18:12] tell you okay it was because of a token
[18:15] applied to my mom and dad's home that
[18:17] did not compromise it it you know I'm
[18:20] sure there were plenty of people who
[18:21] would have said well they're just a
[18:22] little bit legalistic well when the
[18:23] chips were down okay when it really
[18:26] mattered when it was down to the wire
[18:29] okay and it was on on on some night
[18:33] close to midnight when I was on my way
[18:35] to grab the pistol out of my nightstand
[18:37] yeah okay my my mom and dad's Holiness
[18:41] standard saved my life wow okay it
[18:45] wasn't and I don't mean like well I
[18:46] would have been out in the world no
[18:48] they'd have found my carcass in the
[18:50] river all right it was when I got to my
[18:53] front door to where my parents applied
[18:55] the token and said beyond this point is
[18:57] Holy Ground the spirit that was on me
[19:00] could not walk through that
[19:02] door and I turned and it drove me back
[19:05] into the arms of God so do not try to
[19:08] tell me that a Holiness standard that
[19:10] creates conflict with your children will
[19:12] not save them I've done it I've I was
[19:15] saved by it okay be courageous take God
[19:19] at his word when he says that he will
[19:21] save your children when you apply the
[19:23] token he means it and this this business
[19:27] of of well I'm a afraid I'm going to
[19:29] create conflict be conflicted at the end
[19:33] of the day you're not fighting with your
[19:34] kids you're fighting with the devil and
[19:37] the the devil may have been convinced
[19:39] that him and them are on the right on on
[19:41] the same team but they're not and the
[19:42] only way you're going to convince them
[19:43] otherwise is by upholding the standard
[19:45] and allowing God to work through you
[19:47] it's the only way God's not going
[19:50] there's going to be no power there's
[19:52] going to be no power whatsoever in a uh
[19:57] in a week um edited for non-conflict
[20:02] standard of the word there's no power in
[20:05] that at the end of the day the Tree of
[20:08] Life required 100% compliance for Adam
[20:11] and Eve to remain under its
[20:14] influence 100% compliance and when we
[20:17] edit things and when we say well we'll
[20:19] tolerate this sure kids sure wife you
[20:23] can eat of the tree and not surely
[20:27] die I mean
[20:29] come on like it requires that we be be
[20:32] be uncompromising in in what leaders
[20:36] allow in their homes it requires
[20:39] uncompromising uh uh upholding of
[20:42] Standards when we compromise then we
[20:45] strip the power of the word of the Lamb
[20:48] to protect us right when we when we say
[20:51] okay we'll kill the lamb we'll feed on
[20:53] the word we'll do all this stuff we'll
[20:55] be we'll be waiting for the Rapture with
[20:56] our staff in our hand but we'll allow
[20:58] leaven in in the home then the lamb died
[21:01] for
[21:02] nothing you all you did was murder a
[21:04] lamb that's all you did his his blood
[21:07] did you no
[21:11] benefit and I boy that's
[21:14] harsh I I know it you know it it believe
[21:19] me it scalds me before it'll ever reach
[21:21] you right I had to hear it
[21:24] first but it's the truth and if we want
[21:27] to have if we want to have the power of
[21:29] God moving in our lives you know people
[21:31] say oh we want to have the spirit of God
[21:33] moving in the church we want to have the
[21:34] spirit of God moving you know flowing
[21:36] want the gifts and the call you know
[21:37] moving in the church well guess what a
[21:39] church is made up of families amen all
[21:42] right and the church the spirit's not
[21:44] going to move in the church until it's
[21:45] moving in the families and the and and a
[21:48] family is made up of individuals and it
[21:50] starts with dads it starts with men
[21:54] recognizing that they have to live up to
[21:56] a standard of Christ
[21:59] recognizing that that we cannot
[22:00] compromise and and be and by the way
[22:03] before you point any finger at any
[22:04] member of your family recognize that
[22:07] you're pointing a whole lot of fingers
[22:08] back at yourself okay it's don't go
[22:12] don't go chastising your children for or
[22:14] your wife or how they're living before
[22:16] you get down on your knees and verify
[22:18] that you are up to Snuff
[22:20] yourself okay verify that you are not uh
[22:24] you are not the problem okay you know uh
[22:30] every every
[22:32] um no no family no church no
[22:36] organization will ever rise above the
[22:38] level of its leader amen okay no part of
[22:43] the body Rises higher than the head
[22:45] right amen okay as headship you are the
[22:49] the the level that your family will rise
[22:51] to and if you are living like a skunk
[22:55] then don't be surprised when your family
[22:57] does too amen okay that that's just the
[23:01] long and short of it if so if you want
[23:03] to see your family rise then you rise
[23:06] yourself and then because here's the
[23:08] thing if Dad is a
[23:10] hypocrite everybody in the family knows
[23:12] it right you can you can say all you
[23:16] want all you want right you can say
[23:19] whatever you want to say for as long as
[23:21] you want to say it but at the end of the
[23:22] day even if your your your kids can't
[23:26] even articulate it itively like they
[23:29] couldn't you know tell you what the
[23:30] matter is people know subconsciously
[23:33] right even if you couldn't tell you like
[23:35] you don't necessarily know your brain
[23:37] does right there's something in the back
[23:39] of your mind that goes okay there's
[23:40] something wrong here and you know we
[23:42] talk about because don't forget the
[23:44] token is to is to act as a barrier
[23:46] against the angel of death not you know
[23:49] the angel of mild inconvenience right it
[23:51] is it is the angel of of death right
[23:55] therefore when we talk about applying a
[23:57] token we talk about cleaning out the Lev
[23:59] we talk about um uh uh uh being in
[24:02] compliance with the Holiness standard
[24:04] okay and raising that standard over our
[24:08] lives we're talking about life and death
[24:11] issues there is death on the line and so
[24:14] when people say one thing but they don't
[24:18] act like death is on the line then it
[24:20] shows that they don't really believe it
[24:24] okay I can you know I work a lot with
[24:27] electricity right a lot of high voltage
[24:29] electricity and when I think a wire is
[24:31] hot I'm not going to let someone touch
[24:34] it right I'll knock you upside the head
[24:37] before I let you touch it right why
[24:40] because I'm not going to let you blow
[24:42] yourself up and me have to watch you get
[24:45] exploded if I have to hurt you feelings
[24:48] a little bit I'mma do it right because
[24:51] death is on the line amen right it's
[24:54] more important to me if you got a little
[24:55] cauliflower on the ear cuz I smacked you
[24:57] upside the head it's more important that
[24:59] you have that than your arm is exploded
[25:01] because you just grabbed you know 480
[25:03] volts right this is important when dads
[25:08] do not act like death is on the line
[25:11] then your kids know that they don't
[25:13] really believe what they say they
[25:14] believe and they don't have to
[25:16] articulate that you never have to say
[25:18] that it just comes naturally amen
[25:22] right
[25:24] wow that was quick
[25:28] y'all still love me I still love you
[25:32] guys Amen brother but you know it's and
[25:36] we'll just stand and I'll I'll close
[25:38] with this the Bible says that those he
[25:41] loves he also
[25:42] chasteneth okay if if if we didn't
[25:46] preach the word and say what people
[25:48] didn't want to hear and say things that
[25:49] we know are probably going to make us
[25:51] unpopular then it shows we don't love
[25:53] you we could get a lot of adoration a
[25:55] lot of lip service by just tickling
[25:57] people's ears
[25:58] and just saying things that you know get
[26:00] you all whooped up and woohoo this is
[26:02] great you know it feels all all warm and
[26:04] fuzzy um
[26:06] but you know understand that when when
[26:09] any and and I don't want to make this
[26:10] about me or any anything else understand
[26:13] that you know the word of God speaks
[26:16] through many ministers and all ministers
[26:17] have to come to the same point where
[26:19] they're willing to to say no this is the
[26:21] stand that I'm going to make and I'm
[26:22] going to say things that are probably
[26:23] going to be unpopular to hear um because
[26:26] it's the word of God God would never do
[26:28] something God loves you right the God
[26:31] loves you he loves you so much he died
[26:32] for you and so when somebody who loves
[26:35] you that much is willing to say
[26:36] something that's going to make you upset
[26:38] understand they're saying it because
[26:39] it's
[26:40] necessary
[26:44] so we all love the Lord you all love the
[26:46] Lord everybody are you
[26:48] sure all right let's
[26:51] pray father Lord
[26:54] we we love you this morning and we know
[26:57] it is you you know every the the ins and
[27:00] outs of our hearts Lord you know every
[27:02] crack and and and crevice within our
[27:05] hearts Lord that where we would have
[27:07] things that we'd be holding on to or
[27:09] thing deep down on our inside where you
[27:11] know that we love you that you can
[27:13] recognize that seed that was inside of
[27:16] us father that like Boaz could see in
[27:18] Ruth you could see that same character
[27:20] that was in you is in is in US father
[27:24] that you could you could see it on our
[27:26] inside but Lord that no matter how much
[27:31] the devil would have us surrounded and
[27:32] would would battle us and embattle us
[27:34] and and cause doubts and fears and
[27:37] deceptions that Lord you would cut
[27:39] through all of it and that we could
[27:41] cling to the love that you have we could
[27:43] cling to your promise that no matter how
[27:46] tightly the devil may have us bound that
[27:48] we could break through all of it and
[27:51] rise to the level of your word that we
[27:53] could be made perfect made complete by
[27:56] Your Word acting and operating in our
[27:58] lives that father we wouldn't just
[28:00] simply try to lay claim to some some
[28:03] sacrifice Lord and say that that's the
[28:05] blood but reject the life thereof but
[28:07] Lord that we would say that that is the
[28:09] that is our Salvation that is our that
[28:11] is the the the the Messiah that we have
[28:13] accepted into our hearts the the the
[28:15] promised one that would Deliver Us from
[28:17] these things that have us bound that
[28:19] father we would find our Redemption and
[28:22] our submission to your word we ask these
[28:25] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:26] Christ amen
