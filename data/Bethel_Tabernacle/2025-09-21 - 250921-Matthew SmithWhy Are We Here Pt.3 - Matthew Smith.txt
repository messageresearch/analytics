========================================

atosphere in a in a have a a unity of mind being be in a unity of purpose and father we could hear from you and hear a word from you through the Sunday school the foolishness of my small teaching here and that the into the worship service and then the main service Lord that we could grow and edify be edified by your holy spirit through the word and through the ministry we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Um, I want to read, if my device will cooperate, um, want to go to Genesis chapter 2. We're going to continue the thought that I've been um, kind of pursuing um, title, why are we here? And I want to do a a quick uh, recap of um, couple take a couple points from last time and kind of advance a little bit with that. Um, so I want to look at Genesis chapter 2 and um, let's start at uh, we'll do we'll just start at verse 18. Genesis 2 and verse 18 if we could. Um, and um, we'll just begin here. It says uh, and the Lord God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone. I will make him a help for him. And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every foul of the air, and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them. And whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names to all the cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found an help meat for him. And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept, and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh, instead thereof. And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, "This is now born of my bone and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh." Y'all can be seated. Um, so I want to I want to um couple points that I and I I want I made last last time and I kind of want to advance that a little bit. Um so the the the first point and this is sort of the uh kind of the overall main theme of everything that I'm doing here which is that um that that quote um uh if I can find it here um from uh no it's down here um this is from uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Um, he says, "Now, God had a purpose in a hidden mystery." Uh, no, wait, no, that's the wrong one. Um, yeah, here we go. Notice God has had a three-fold purpose in this great mystery secret. God and his great mystery secret that he had before the world began, he's got a three-fold purpose in it. And now, what we want to go upon this morning, what is that three-fold purpose? Now, I believe by the help of God who's present, he'll show it to us. Now, if he had this three-fold purpose, we want to find out what that three-fold purpose is. Um, and then in another place, um, uh, yeah, right here, he says, uh, and same same message, he says, uh, he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible. Therefore, the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ. The entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had, one purpose. He wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been in type an expressing what God's great goal is. So God through the entire Bible the you know the big question of why is humanity even on the earth why God bothered made making humans in the first place is to fulfill this three-fold purpose that he has. And if and and again for sake of time, I don't want to turn my recap into a rehash. Um so but but the the point was that the three-fold purpose of God is that God wanted to be a heavenly father. He wanted to be um and and to have uh children and and to express himself as a father. He wanted to have a a a bride and and express himself as a husband. And he wanted to bring his children through redemption back into a united family in a garden of Eden condition. That's what three-fold purpose was. Um, and so, you know, that's kind of the overarching theme of why we are here. Um, but there's and obviously there's a lot to that. Um, and effectively what that means is that the family and the family structure is a central part of everything that's in the message. Everything is in the message of the hour revolves around family and family order. Okay? It's the it's the it's how we all got here, right? Everyone's got a mom and a dad somewhere. you know, even if you don't know them, you got a mom and a dad somewhere. The fact that and the and and there's becomes a lot of hurt and trauma and and and suffering that comes from from having broken family structure and broke broken family order. Um, but that's not the original intent. That's not the that's not the plan that God had. The other thing that I want to that I mentioned last time that I want to that is more local to what I want to talk to today is that uh we talked about the type right that there was there was a type that God communicates through types. It type God communicates through types and shadows. It's how he conveys his word to people in a way that we can understand. And so when God lays out a type in the Bible, if you get on the in the wrong type, then you end up with consequences that you were never supposed intended to have um how we talked about how Moses how Moses struck the rock the second time when he was supposed to speak to the rock. And when he did that, it got him into the wrong type, which meant he couldn't go to the promised land. God couldn't allow him to go to the promised land. He had to he he died looking over the border, you know, never fulfilling this great purpose that he had in his life, right? I mean, Moses, you know, gifts and callings are without repentance. Moses was trying to fulfill the calling in his life, which was to lead his the God's children into the promised land long before he had a burning bush experience. &gt;&gt; That's why he killed the Egyptian in the first place and and had to flee Egypt. &gt;&gt; Because he was trying to deliver his people, but without the help of God. So, he was trying to fulfill the g the calling in his life without the a burning bush experience. That doesn't mean that, you know, ultimately God would have him do that. I guess my my point is this is something that Moses was longing for and desiring for and it was what he was put on the earth to do. And so his whole goal was to deliver God's children to the promised land. And when it all came down to it, his life did not receive the level of fulfillment that it could have had because he got into the wrong type. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? He never got to see the actual culmination, the fulfillment of God's people making it there because he died before they got there because he got into the wrong type. That did mean that God did It didn't mean that God Moses wasn't a wonderful great man that God used wonderfully. I mean, the things that that the Bible has to say about Moses, man, if any one of us could achieve 1% of that, you know, we'd we'd be really something. Likewise, Christians, people with the Holy Ghost, you can be a child of God. You can be a real deal child of God. Really truly love the Lord with all your heart. But if you get into the wrong type, then you're going to end up with earthly walk issues, right? Moses' earthly walk did not ultimately have all that it was not all that it could have been because he got into the wrong type. He he he got into the wrong um he got on the wrong side of the of the word there. Same thing happens with us. We can be a holy have the Holy Ghost, but if you're not in the, you know, you're you're you're not following the type of the word in your family order, in your family structure, you can end up with all kinds of calamity. Doesn't mean that you don't go to heaven. It doesn't mean that you, you know, you're some heathen that God's going to cast out. It just means that now you have a bunch of train wreck on your hands that you have to deal with. It now means that there's a lot of fulfillment. the the the fulfillment that we have in our hearts to have family to have the desire that we have to have family and children and wife and husband and all these things may go unfulfilled because we got out of the order of God's word &gt;&gt; right those you know the the Lord promises you the Holy Ghost he does not necessarily promise you a a marriage right he doesn't necessarily promise you these things um because that some of that's on you some of that's on are you willing to follow the pattern of the word now if you follow the word, then he's faithful to he he wants it for you, right? God wanted Moses to go to the go to the promised land. That that was part of he had that desire for Moses. That's why he told him what to do to to speak to the rock in the first place. But because Moses had a had a failure, it it created um it really inhibited the the how how fulfilled Moses could be. Now, I say all that to say to say this, and this is kind of I I apologize in advance, and normally I have a lot more I'm a lot more put together. This is one of those situations where I had a thought and then the Lord kind of shifted gears on me as I was walking out the door. So, um if if I if this is a little this next bit is a little bit less organized than I usually am, then I apologize. Um uh I wanted to kind of address something. Um and it's a it's an issue that I think is it's pervasive I think in the message a lot and and I know why it's not I'm not if anybody thinks I'm being critical. I'm not. I I know why this is and I and I I don't begrudge anybody. Um and I'm not trying to be critical and I'm not trying to be controversial. Please, please don't think I'm trying to be some some controversial person. Um, but I think that in the message we do run into a we have a tendency to lean very heavily on the idea that um if we just get the Holy Ghost, that's it. &gt;&gt; Just get the Holy Ghost and everything's right there, right? And we it's we have camp meetings and it's just get the Holy Ghost and we have youth camps and we're driving people, you know, young people towards the Holy Ghost. And I don't disagree with that. Please do not think that I am in any way, shape, or form trying to lessen the impact and the importance of getting the Holy Ghost. Um, where I I think that we need to be careful is thinking that that is the beall end all end of the story that you get the Holy Ghost and there's nothing else that happens. &gt;&gt; That will lead you to train wreck. &gt;&gt; Um, because what happens so just and I'll and I'll give you the the type here. Um, you know, if you look at at Christ, right, Christ is the wave sheath. We are Christians. We are named after Christ. We pattern our lives after Christ. Christ, you know, Christ's life was that he he he at the beginning of his ministry, he went to the river Jordan, right? He went to he met John at the river Jordan. And what did he do? Jordan represented death, death to self. He went was baptized under John's ministry was a baptism of repentance. So there's justification, &gt;&gt; you know, justification, san uh justification, repentance, and death to self. Then he's baptized in water baptism. There's sanctification and water baptism. And then the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove. There's the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Okay? There's your pattern. That's Acts chapter 2 fulfilled in Christ's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. And then he has a three and a half year ministry in which he, as Hebrew, I believe is 5:3 says, he learned obedience to the things that he suffered. though he was a son. He was a son but he still had to learn obedience to the things that he suffered. And then at the end of that he goes to Mount Transfiguration in which there's a which is where brother Brandham goes to to teach adoption. Okay. So there was there was a maturing process that had to come between the point at which Christ the Holy Ghost descended upon Christ and the point at which he goes to Mount Transfiguration. Something happened in there. Otherwise why didn't he why did he go to the wilderness? Why did he have to suffer all these things? Why did why was Christ not ready to go to the cross as soon as he left the River Jordan? Why didn't why didn't that happen? Right? Well, no. It's because there's there had because he's laying out the pattern and the type for of us, right? Because that's this because this is how we're going to be. Because when you get to the mount transfiguration, it's called transfiguration because he was what? Transfigured, right? There was a changing of his body on that mountain. there was and and it's important if you go look at the type it's because in the in the adoption ceremony what does the the father do he raises he puts his his son before the elders right Moses and Elijah and then he puts the the father puts his robe on the son right that's Christ's glorified body on the mountain right and and to say this is this person this my son he was always my blood son but now he speaks with my authority he he is the all that I am now poured into this child or you know I guess at that point they're grown men you know by the time they're reaching adoption. My point is there's education and there's training that happens between the Holy Ghost and the body change &gt;&gt; right this does you don't just go overnight you you know you don't get the Holy Ghost and they get beamed on top of the head with everything that you'll ever need to know. &gt;&gt; Um you know and and now there's a there's a there's an aspect and a component of that. Um, brother Brandham talks and I don't just say brother Brandham, there's many examples that I know of personally where this happened. Um, where but the example that we we'll all be familiar with is um when brother Brandham's in Africa and you have the the the women the native women there who are in the in the service and they're naked. They don't have any education on on holiness dress and um he just preaches an Acts two Acts 2 sermon. They get the Holy Ghost and immediately the Holy Ghost convicts them to recovering themselves. they start fighting start finding blankets to to wrap up and and and covering themselves to to to become uh uh modest. Um and there was no training on that. They were just they the the the revelation of of holiness dress was revealed to them as soon as they got the Holy Ghost. And that's true. That's wonderful. That happens. And I and I know of other examples in the states where that happened. um uh where girls um come right off the street and you know completely immodest, completely um you know you know just completely immodest go to an altar, get the Holy Ghost and and are immediately trying to you know find a blanket or something to cover up and and they have no training. They complete heathens, no educa, you know, nobody taught them that this this happens. So no one's no one's going to argue that that that can't happen. What? But where we we we run a foul of this is don't forget that brother Brandham preached marriage and divorce to Holy Ghost fil people, right? He preached church order to holy ghostfilled people. You know, you don't Yes, it is true that the Holy Ghost is the tutor. It will teach you these things. It will lead you to into all these this truth, but it's going to do it through the foolishness of a preacher. But it's the Holy Ghost operating through a five-fold ministry. If you if you could just have all the revelation as soon as you got the Holy Ghost, well then why why am I here? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. What am I doing? I I don't I mean I got better stuff to do, you know, than but but but I don't you know I I'm I'm not I'm not you know the Lord has something for me to do. The Lord will operate through me because he y'all have need of stuff and I have need of stuff which is why I sit under under ministry and hear ministers preach. &gt;&gt; Everybody we the Lord operates through ministry to teach you. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we have this idea that um I heard it. It's forgive me if if people think I'm trying to tell a joke. I'm not. It's it's a parable but it's kind of funny. Um it's the and I'm sure we've all heard it too but it's the it's that's why it's not that funny. Um, but it's the it's the story of the guy he he gets stranded on the desert island, right? And and he's a Christian. He believes, oh, you know, I'm going to pray and the Lord's going to deliver me from this island. And he prays and he, you know, prays and he sings and has a jubilee right there and know the Lord holds the scripture and and really gets a revelation that the Lord's going to deliver him from that island. He just knows it. And the next day, a a ship sails by and they see him there and they send out a boat for him and the captain comes to meet him on the shore and go, "Oh, captain, thank you for coming to meet me, but I, you know, I appreciate the help, but I don't need it. The Lord's going to deliver me." And the captain sails away. And then the next day, a helicopter flies over and lands. Hey, buddy, get on the No, I don't need it. I don't need no, you know, tree of knowledge, deliverance. I've got a a word from the Lord. The Lord's going to deliver me. Power spoken word. And then the helicopter flies away. And then the man dies on the island. And you know, he he gets to heaven and he asked the Lord, "Lord, I I I thought I had a a revelation you were going to deliver." He goes, "Well, son, I I sent you a boat and a helicopter. What else did you want?" &gt;&gt; You know what? What more could I have done for you? And so, a lot of times people think, "I need deliverance. I need I need the you know, my my family's in shambles. I've got marriage problems. I've got finance problems. I've got children problems. I've got all these problems. Everything's a mess and and broken. And I need the Lord to just power spoken word reveal." Well, the Lord's going to do that over a pullpit, right? The Lord's going to do that if if you will just so go sit under the under the you know, you have it doesn't mean you don't have the Holy Ghost. Doesn't mean that the Lord can't do that in a lot of ways. A lot of times the Lord can miraculously do stuff. But in a lot of times, the Lord's going to need you to reconform your lifestyle to the word so that he can operate. &gt;&gt; Think of it like this. And I I have five minutes left, so and and I'm going to get to my text. Um, in the text we read, just briefly, just for the sake of time, I'm not going to reread it. It's Adam and he's alone in the garden and God's going to give him a wife. And then at the end of that, it says, and and for this, it goes tells a story and it's Adam and he's naming the things. And then at the bottom, it says the last verse we read was, and it the Bible says, if I can find it again, where'd it go? Uh well anyways it says um and for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife. That Adam didn't say that line. God didn't say that line to Adam. That's the narrator of the Bible breaking the fourth wall and talking to the audience. &gt;&gt; All right &gt;&gt; and saying hey this story that I just told you here's why I told that to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's the narrator talking to you and saying, "Hey, for this cause, young men are to leave their father and mother so they can build their own headship. So they can be like Adam, a individual relationship with God and young man, so that he can build the garden that he will bring his Eve into." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. This is a foundation. the the the the foundation of the marriage does not a marriage does not start at an altar with a preacher. A marriage starts when a young man gets the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's where it starts. If you try to start it anywhere else, you're out of the order of God's word. you might or or or you you know you have you have all the right components but you've got them mix matched and now you're going to have a bunch of marriage problems because young man didn't get a a tight strong relationship with God first. &gt;&gt; It was an individual relationship with God and man first and then he can seek a wife and then and he but he has to leave his father and mother. You try to have a young man who never leaves the headship of his dad, who's always a mama's boy, who's who he he can never go out on his own and lead his own household, just him. How is he supposed to lead lead a family? How is he supposed to lead a wife? He can't lead himself, right? He has no revelation. He can't keep himself in church on his own. And how many times and and and I know like and it's a it's a it's a common thing but but and I I I have I man I could preach on that for a long time but I got three minutes so I'm not gonna um the the the issue is that's the actual pattern of the word and it's the foundation of the of of a marriage. It's the foundation of a household is the man's relationship with God and is he in line with the word? Is he following the pattern and the type that God laid out? because if he's not, then you're going to end up with something else. You're going to be like Moses. You're going to be somewhere else. And what happens is we have this thing of, well, just get the Holy Ghost. And it's like, well, okay, we're going to build a house. And your job is to build a house. Your job is to build a household, but just, hey, just get the spirit of the builder. You don't need to learn how to read blueprints. You don't need to learn how any of the tools work. You don't need to know how to, you know, order lumber. You don't need any of that. Just get the spirit of the builder. Okay. Well, you got the spirit of the builder and you can try and you'll build a structure. you'll build something. It's going to be crooked. The the foundation's going to be offkilter because you didn't you don't know how to read the blueprints, &gt;&gt; right? No one instructed you on how to read the blueprints. And so, you built something, but you didn't build but none of the doors open and close correctly. None of the windows close because the house is all tilted over and they don't slide. And it's cuz the foundation's completely off level. And the the issue was that the relationship the foundation was the man's relationship with God. And it wasn't right to begin with. And so now the whole house is shifted over. And so what we want, what we want is we have a a a dysfunctional home and the dad is coming in there going to family camp. He gets fired up. Lord, you can deliver my family's spoken word. And what he's not recognizing is that his relationship, which is the foundation on which everything else is built, is out of kilter. And what he wants is for the the the, you know, divine power to come in there and square the children back up so all the doors open and close, &gt;&gt; right? wants to square the wife up because you can take a you take a crooked house and and if the foundation is crooked and then all the walls are crooked and obviously the doors don't open and close. But you can take them and if you get a big enough shim and a big enough lag bolt and a comealong, you can crank that door jam over to the point where it will open and close because you've rescared it to the foundation. But the problem is the foundation is wrong, &gt;&gt; right? M &gt;&gt; so God can't come in and resquare your home because to you because you're not squared to the word. And for God to square the home to you and you're not square to the word which means now he's squaring the family to something that's not his word and he can't do that. &gt;&gt; That's why it can't you know it's not going to doesn't always happen overnight and instantaneously. Sometimes it takes years of blood, sweat, and tears and a lot of praying and agonizing and difficult conversations and really hard trials to resquare the family because it's going to take dad getting himself put back together and himself put back under the subject of the word and then the family can can come into subject that God can't square a family to a a crooked foundation &gt;&gt; because it will the the ultimately the the whole house will still be crooked. It's just you won't notice it as much. It'll be more functionally wrong. &gt;&gt; It'll be wrong, but just a little more functional. You know, you can take a transmission and pack sawdust in the transmission and it won't rattle so bad, &gt;&gt; right? The transmission's shot. Don't get me wrong. It's going to blow up on the highway, but you don't hear the rattling. You didn't fix anything, right? And so, God's not going to do that. God's not going to make a family more he's not gonna he's not going to just just paper over all the all the holes in the walls be you know until until the the found we have to go back to the basics and and say look the the foundation is dad get the dad right make sure dad's in line with the word because he's the head of the household everyone's going to follow the head and when dad is right then he can go to mom and you can build you can fix the marriage marriage and God's not going to fix the children till you fix the marriage because the pattern is de husband then wife then children &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; not in any other order than that right &gt;&gt; and if if you want to fix the marriage then you have to start in that order &gt;&gt; right you start with dad then you fix the marriage between uh mom and dad and then you fix the relationship between parents and children if you try to fix the relationship between parents and children while the marriage is effectively broken and dysfunctional And there's a there's no no unity between mom and dad and you're trying to fix the the relationship with the kids, then you're trying to you're you're trying to raise kids in a broken home. &gt;&gt; You're trying to raise ch it is a it is it is a divorced. It is a it is a out of wedlock in name only or you're only married in name only, right? You're effectively trying to raise children out of wedlock because the marriage the love and the unity and the cherishing that bound the marriage to begin with is gone. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so now you you're married sort of. There's no actual marriage there. There's no love in it. And you fix that first before you try to fix the relationship with your kids. &gt;&gt; So anyways, I'm going to quit before I get myself into the preachers time. So let's uh let's pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, we come before you this morning praying that something that this foolish foolish man might have said that would have been anointed by you that Lord that someone could have taken something that was said and held on to it and and applied it and maybe be encouraged to draw closer to you and to your word. there could be there could be a a rising higher, Lord, that the things of this world that would cling to us, that they would all fall away as we would rise higher and draw closer to you. We ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you guys. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
