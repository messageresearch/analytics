Amen God bless you all greet you in the name of the Lord this evening going to invite you to the gospel of St Luke chapter 1 and um no I'm not preaching my Easter message tonight but it might seem like it amen amen so I wanted to uh get back to um I thought I took some Services ago the true God this will be part two tonight hopefully the Lord will allow me to get to it all amen I've had it on my heart to carry on with that thought uh since I preached it I knew I only got about halfway down amen so uh I figured I owed the Lord another shot at it amen praise the Lord and so I actually um pushed brother Mattis out he owes us part two to last Wednesday so uh we'll be looking forward to that amen amen but the father should go ahead of the son Amen brother Jason good to see you back amen happy to have him back with us all in one piece amen and there's a lot to report we've been getting little Snippets of it and so the Lord is doing some tremendous tremendous things um right right away it's it's happening in real time so I just think we're close to home friends I just believe that with all my heart it's very exciting uh to be a believer uh at this hour Sarah good to see you here God bless you amen Luke chapter 1 and we're going to read verses 26 through through 38 a little bit lengthy it's very familiar to us you've been reading this since the days when you were in Sunday school Luke 1: 26-38 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee Nam uh named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women when she saw him she was troubled at this saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God so this is this is a point that the angel really wants her to absorb you are highly favored you have found favor now she's going to need to believe that for what's coming coming cuz she's about to hear something quite impossible but when you're highly favored and when you're doubly highly favored that's then all things are possible amen verse 31 and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her Mary as you know is a perfect uh type of the Bride of today you have all kinds of examples you can go back you can pick up Sarah you can pick up Rahab you can pick up Esther you can pick up Ruth but Mary is really where brother brandham brought it to for the Bride of the last day those other ones also type the bride in in various ways but this one here is the most poignant for us so we're going to look at it from this angle tonight let's pray father we thank you for your divinely revealed truths Lord we thank you for the hearing the reading and the hearing of your word read we thank you for your anointing throughout the the afternoon Lord as I co pondered Lord and thought about this thought and it's been on My Heart Lord to bring this second portion this second installment Lord it still Burns in my heart and I pray tonight that you'll give us hearing Hearts tonight to see and hear and understand all that you you are doing and accomplishing in this hour we commit ourselves into your hands for service in Jesus name amen God bless you as you're seated we found out last time and I just want to take a few minutes and just bring back to your memory some of the points that we made last time we found a great advant AG uh of loving a true God and and the and a and even a as if it were icing on the cake or the cherry on top having that true God love you back and in fact is we found out that he in fact first loved us and he loved us in a in a rather um a rather amazing way when we were pretty much unlovable and when we were lost and we were undone and we had no chance and we were on our way to hell and there was nothing we could do about it God loved us during that time and we found out that in our opening text last time we read from Proverbs 3 and we found out that that if we will but acknowledge God in all of our ways then he would direct our paths now you know there there's you know there's there's friends and then there's real friends there's friends that are friends in the good times and in the bad AB times they're friends not just fair weather friends but they are friends forever and they have your best interest and a real friend will always tell you the truth that's a real friend a real friend won't just um try to butter you up for Advantage but a real friend is somebody that'll that you can count on to walk with you down the paths of life and tonight you know we're talking about not just any friend but I want to give you this phrase tonight that if we have a friend in Jesus and that being the case is he your friend then good news you have a Divine friend now it's one thing to have a human friend it'd be one thing to have a rich human friend it'd be one thing to have a powerful human friend but if you have a Divine friend you have somebody with more riches and more power than can be measured he is a Divine friend and a friend indeed he's willing to direct our paths these are some of the advantages that we looked at last time there's we found that there's Great Value the Bible talks about where we read in James 2 how that Abraham believed God and he was called the friend of God we found the Great Value in knowing Christ as a close friend we found out that that he had commissioned IED you know his family he commissioned Abram he commissioned Joshua he's he's he's good about commissioning his family and he said to Abraham now just look in every direction and I want you to walk through the land Abraham because everywhere you walk I'm going to give it to you he said to Joshua you know uh your footsteps everywhere you put your footstep he' said it to Moses he said it to Joshua he has said to you a night and night a prophet picked it up in this day and said footsteps mean possession you know it'd be one thing to have a really uh powerful human friend you might have a politically connected friend you might have a financially connected friend but I will assure you that none of those friends can give you eternal life there's only one friend that can do that and in order to get eternal life your friend has to be a Divine friend because there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life and that's Divine Life and so it's one thing for somebody to say to me hey here's some acreage and everywhere you walk I'm going to give it to you well and fine okay thank you but it's going to Ash and Cinder in the tribulation period it ain't going to do me a lot of good then I'd like to have a land that's given to me that can never perish that no one can ever take it away away from me and that here's the beautiful part all I had to do was give him control of my life and he promise to lead me and guide me to that reward amen everywhere that I would walk would be my possession we found out last time that he you know the the the requirement would be that we would keep our lives free from the things of the world we found out that it's to keep ourselves free from anything and this is good advice for you tonight it's good advice for you tomorrow it' be good advice for your family be good advice for their family who aren't even arrived in the earth yet go ahead and put this in your tool bag that if you want to give your loved ones advice that that is that has that has some value is tell them to keep their lives free from anything that is not the tree of life amen we live in the world we make use of the world but we we showed you last time how that while it is that we use the world we don't use it as abusing it as Paul taught the Corinthian Church in 1 Corinthians 7 he said in one as those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it now that that's an amazing way to say it he said in the in the KJV and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passes passees away there's no better advice that you can give your loved ones than to say don't chase this world because it's passing away set your affections on things above there's no better counsel you can give your children but I'm here to tell you parents if they don't see those words in your life those words will ring hollowed so we we find then that the the whis translation had said those who are making use of this world as not making excessive use of it for the temporary fashion of the world is passing away colossian Church set their affections on things above and not on things of the earth and we found out things like you know we here here's something that that really meant a lot to me last time and we find that God's guidance and wisdom is offered to us that we are told by Solomon to trust in the Lord with all your heart don't lean to your own understanding and all your ways submit to him say what will I get here's the beauty you're going to get something you ready he will make your path straight now that's good since straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leadth to life I need somebody to make my path straight Hallelujah we found out that he's unlike these arrogant monarchs of History he doesn't need he's not on some Power Trip he actually is he's he's he loves a contrite heart he loves love he loves Faith he loves his family and we found out that Jesus has a very generous Spirit but here was something that we cautioned you of last time and and I used you know my own self as a as a as a kind of in contary distinction to God he's not a doie grandpa so you know the the thing you know ad doie grandpa will sometimes give grandchildren things that aren't necessarily good for them things that are give them cavities and things that'll spoil them and things that'll make it hard on Mom and Dad but things that don't that'll you know give them the wrong idea about life being a free ride it's not a free ride I'm glad that Christ is very generous in spirit but we found out he still has a royal heart and he's not used to being dictated to he is a king your friend is a king see and so so we realize then that he he he he understands emotions this is what we discovered last time we reminded you not only does he understand your feelings sometimes we can get in a place where we think nobody understands us I'll promise you he does he understands feelings he understands emotions we said to you last time he invented them I'd say the inventor of emotions and feelings understands them he has supreme power we found out that it's in perfect control and this is what he has called you to if you want to be his friend then he he's calling you to give him control of your life so that he can make make your path straight so that he can leave you lead you from Darkness into light and so that so that you can actually be a partaker you're join AES uh with Christ you're Heirs of God but join AES with Christ see so we're partakers with him we found out that he is our refuge and our strength David said he knows listen this this was to me this was so beautiful last time when we read that Psalms 46 one of my favorite Psalms God is Not will be not may be God is our refuge and strength he's a very present very present help in time of trouble I want you to understand that he knows what Satan has done to you he knows that you were born in sin he knows that the devil has taken advantage of that he knows that God God is a loving God and he knows that Satan as Paul taught us in the Book of Romans that Satan used the law that was meant for our good and he manipulated it against us because we couldn't keep it and therefore he bound us and Paul said that which was supposed to be for my life was actually for my death I want you to know Jesus understands that I want you to know this Divine friend knows that Satan trapped you in in your birth he knows that Satan got you to do all kinds of things that tonight you'd say I regret those things I wish i' had never done them I'm here to tell you something friend God understands these things he understands how Satan has manipulated the world he Satan has seen to it has seen to it that the bride in the last day she has to live uh daily in a world that is so polluted and so filthy and so Godless and so vile but I want you to know you've got a friend in Jesus you've got a friend who cares and a friend who understands a friend you say but what about the devil and what about what I did and what about my weaknesses and what about my problems I'm here to tell you that because you got a Divine friend he takes every charge that the enemy brings against you and throws it out of his courtroom before Satan can even bring the charge my friend the judge toss it is the case my friend the judge won't hear it and it's already dismissed before the devil can even bring the charge this Divine friend is ready to save to the utmost that's where we finished last time that he's ready to save to the utmost he's ready to forgive and he's not only ready to forgive I want you to know this friend is ready to forget it he's not just here to forgive your sins he's here to forget your sins he's here to absolve it he's here to bring you back to a virgin condition because he only recognizes the image he saw of you before the foundation of the world what a friend we have in Jesus this Divine friend he offers many blessings and gifts for his family his family who who allow him to save them from sin he's always willing I want you to know that this Divine friend that you walk around with daily the one that you speak to I hope as you're going to sleep at night the one who you greet with the morning's light in the morning when I Rise Give Me Jesus this divine friend is always willing to use his miraculous power on your behalf he's willing to heal you mind body and soul and he's willing actually he's willing to even do it on the spot by a miracle amen if it's in your best interest he's always going to bring you through he doesn't always do it by a miracle because that's not always in your your best interest you see friends you got a real friend you got a real friend you ain't got a friend who just tries to stay on your good side by giving you everything H right on your hand brother Brandon found out when he was raising kids he said you know he said I found out that when I just give my kids everything right on their hand they don't appreciate it and and a Heavenly Father understands that but just know this that he's always willing to help he's always willing to save don't ever let the devil tell you he's not willing just because the way he might be helping you isn't exactly how you would like it to come I'm here to tell you you have a real friend he's always willing to supply your needs that's what fathers do he's always willing to listen don't ever let the devil Dr drive you off into a shadow somewhere and think nobody understands I can't talk to nobody oh you can talk to this one you can give your heart to this one this one won't this one won't betray you this friend won't stab you in the back this friend won't ridicule you this friend won't ever use it against you this friend won't ever gossip about you you have a real friend in the Lord Jesus he'll guide you he'll always give you the best decisions he'll be a friend that's closer than anybody else ever could be he's all wise he knows the future I mean you got a friend all wise knows the future and here's a point that I like about that he knows the future he's all wise and because he's also all powerful he actually is a friend who can do something about it if he sees you got a problem and you got a problem and you see it and you go to him I want you to know you got a Divine friend who can actually do something about it than lord it's one thing we can be sorry for you we can pray for you I can I can pity you I can I can have empathy I can have sympathy I can do you know I can and and and the Bible T you know and I can I can do this and I can give you that and I can help you along but I'm here to tell you something friends as much of a friend as I am to you I'm limited in what I can do for you but I here's what I can do for you I can introduce you to somebody who can do anything he can fix it if it's wrong thank God if you got a problem if there's something wrong I'm here to tell you this friend can fix it or because he's such a friend because he's a true friend because he's a Divine friend who knows all sees all he may actually decide to allow it he may help you by allowing it you you still like him you still want this friend do you trust him do you really trust him make up your mind tonight and say this friend this Divine friend I will trust him with my life forever don't take it back tomorrow say the same thing next week say the same thing it doesn't matter what happens or doesn't happen it doesn't matter how it comes out it doesn't matter whether it comes out the way you wanted or the way you prayed you got a Divine friend he's exactly why you can rejoice in suffering he's why you understand that even in Trials even if this great friend knows that this trial is going to be for your good uh you know don't ever lose sight of the fact don't ever let the devil tell you I am the Lord's messenger tonight to call the devil a liar and I'm here to tell you the truth of God's word that I don't care what happens in your situation this Divine friend who I'm here to represent has always been and shall always be in perfect control nothing can escape him nothing can overpower him nothing he he can't be cancelled Hallelujah he can't be stopped this is a friend that I'm offering you tonight friends he's he has perfect power supreme power under perfect control and I promise you this he'll cause it to work for your good if you let him he alone can answer all your questions about life he alone can make sense of your past thank God he alone can give you the peace in your heart that we so need in this hour of Darkness he cares he can explain everything and and and often he does explain everything but not always he doesn't always explain it you know why because he's a really good parent I'd like to see the crazy parent that explains every single thing to their children you need your head examined let me just tell you I I I've raised kids and grandkids and helped raise grandkids and and hope to raise great grandkids if the Lord help help help raise them but I'm here to tell you you can't explain everything to Children you would even harm them trying see so he cares he can explain it if it's for your good he often does but he doesn't always do it it's just like any good parent but more important by far more important by far if you let him he will always point you to what's important he might not explain everything but understand he will always point you to what's important he can teach you the proper lessons you need to learn that are always always everybody say always they're always for your benefit always and for your strength listen friends I've said this for years it's not in my notes I just want to say it right now trials do not come to weaken you they they don't come to weaken your faith that's not why they come they come to strengthen you so I say to you tonight don't let them weaken you cuz that's the devil the devil likes to use trials to weaken you that's not why God sends them if you want a test fail one you want to you want to get a test from the Lord fail one I promise you you'll take that test again and again and again until you pass it you got a faithful friend he doesn't want you to live in weakness although at times and for certain seasons and for his own reason he may allow you to be weak at times it's so that he can be made strong generally his eternal plan just understand no matter what the devil tries to whisper to you his eternal plan is that you be in health and prosper brother Brandon there there direct quotes you know I I remember as a young Minister and this maybe this will help the young Ministry team you know when I first started preaching I was I had a concern a needless concern I didn't need to worry about it and the Lord straightened me out and I never worried about it again and I always worried about you know the whole whole thing about you know I'd heard brother brandham say you know you got to be careful he's talking about his office as a prophet and that Authority that the angel said if you if you get them to believe nothing will stand before your prayers and and brother brandham got in trouble with that because he said he said I he would actually stop the prayer line and if he had a devil that was resistant and he wouldn't let that person pass until he healed him he said I KN I knew the strength of the promise the angel had made me and the angel correct Ed him on that and brother Bram admits it on tape don't throw something at me he admits it on tape and he said he pointed out to me he said you're doing something in your services in your meetings that the Lord Jesus didn't do in his Earthly Ministry said he walked into a to a to the to the pool and healed one man and left everybody else said the son does nothing but what he sees the father doing first and brother brandham said I made up my mind right then and there he said I would pray for everybody but I would let Jesus decide who he was going to heal and so you know he say you know you got to be careful with that kind of a an anointing and that kind of power and he said somebody come along and God's got a curse on them and you take it off said you get in trouble with God and you cause the pro the the the problem to be worse and so I you know I had all of this all these Shadows oh my goodness what do I do you know and I'm just just you know Mis understanding how brother Brandon was explaining it all about his own Ministry and the things that he had to learn and I realized one day you know the Lord just spoke to me in my heart and I said Lord I you know is it what what if I'm praying for somebody it's not your will to heal them but yet I would find quoes where brother Bron would say he would say now you see all those people lined up on that wall they're they they had them lined up down the wall sometimes they'd be lined out the door and down blocks and he said they're coming through the line to be prayed for and brother Brandon would say on tape he said I'm just as sure that it's God's will to heal every last one of them as anything see because it's always his will but but all but a lot of times his will works through folds of his purpose and he has to bring a certain purpose in your life and he h he knows the future he's all powerful he's all wise I promise you you can just put your life in his hands I promise you you can just put your life you can just close your eyes and just walk forward and say Lord take my hand lead me on Hallelujah You' got a friend in Jesus and I realized you know the Lord said you know and and suddenly that begun began to be so clear to me and I thought lord it's not up to me to decide who's your who what how you're going to do what when and how and it's my my I have a commission to pray for the sick so I'm just going to pray for the sick I'll pray for everybody you decide who you heal it ain't I don't got to worry about it see so he he has these Eternal plans and he has has a plan for you to be in health and prosper and he wants you to be able listen he he he he would you know the the the love of God promises you peace that passes understanding and he wants you to be able to work in his kingdom he actually wants you to be able to and so he has every Pro provision for you to make that possible but at the end of the day it's still up to you to receive it under his terms amen you've got to receive it under his terms his terms are are are what allow him you know to be the Lord of your life and and in fact is his his greatest goal is to make you in every way a new creation in Christ Jesus say what is the Lord doing to my life now you know no brother Jason it seems like it's nothing but chaos well maybe you need to back up and say Lord have I resisted your will is there something in my life am I holding out because if you do you understand he won't he won't he won't overcome why why would he give you a a a will and a free moral agency if he's just going to overrule it you understand so so he beckons to you he calls to you that's what he did to Israel when Israel ended up out in the wilderness and he found her sitting in her own blood and she was half dead and and he said he said I will coup to her I will call to her I will draw her unto me I'm here to tell you something friends this loving friend you have is full of love and full of compassion and he wants to help you his terms are that you must allow him to be Lord of your life and then when you allow him to be complete Lord of your life that's when he can make you a new creation in Christ Jesus there's no question that he loves you with a deep love there's no question there's no question that he loves you with a deep love and he desires to share his eternal life with you he desires to share his entire Kingdom with you he you know that's what he said to Esther to the half of my kingdom the half of my kingdom is an Eastern way of monarchs saying I'll share it all with you it's not that's not their way of saying I'll have half and you have half they're saying to the to the half of my kingdom in other words everything I am you'll be all of my position you'll have we'll we'll we're going to share this thing together a king and a queen Hallelujah he desires to share his entire Kingdom Universe wide with you he desires to place you in a position of usefulness he desires to place you in a position of authority he wants to be able to trust you so he tests you and he tries you to strengthen you as I said that's why Trials come don't let them weaken you amen don't let them weaken you that's not why they come he's training you and you must be willing to come through his training and sometimes friends there are things that God is training you for that I would just say it like this it it'll be a lifetime of training because you remember as I've said to you so many times over the years this life ain't about this one it's about the one coming and so your whole lifetime there are things in my life that I'm still being trained on and every time I think I've got it figured out I get a whole new textbook and as soon as I memorize all that one I get a whole another textbook and I realize this is training for life because he's training me for an eternal life the choice is yours it always is it's always up to you put as simply as I can the only decision to be made is yours because you already know his I've proven it to you in the Bible amen last time we covered a lot of scriptures I don't want to go back over all of those again I'm just going to mention a few briefly God's love and compassion are seen in the Book of Romans Paul uh that's one of the greatest books The Book of Romans is the book Martin Luther said every Christian should memorize I guess in Luther's eyes I'm not quite a Christian because I ain't memorized it but it but they but it said that if you were deserted on a on a on a deserted island and you could only have one book out of the entire Bible you'd want the book of Romans uh and it is it is a profound book but we find that Romans 5'8 says God demonstrates his love for us he doesn't just say it's not just Whispering sweet nothings he just doesn't say I love you he actually demonstrates his love in this that while we were still sinners Christ died for us what more proof do you need verses 9 to 11 go on to show how that we were justified by the blood of Christ and that we were saved from God's Wrath and we have been reconciled back to God through Jesus Christ through repentance and faith and we're now Justified and reconciled we become New Creations no longer think about being a new creation you're no longer an enemy of God you're no longer lost in sin you're no longer a tool of the devil thank God thank God I don't want to be a tool of the devil I don't want to be that I want to be in the hand of almighty God we found out that in Paul taught the Corinthian Church in the 15th chapter of First Corinthians that in Adam all die but in Christ all are Made Alive your your natural birth you were doomed face it I'm sorry don't let that hurt your feelings don't let that put you in a bad mood I know you got great parents and you might be a great person but because of the way you were born you're a dead person you're dying and you're dying and when you're done dying you're dying more but I'm here to tell you that you can be made alive in the Lord Jesus Christ we found out in first John chap 1 that salvation and forgiveness comes through him if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness we found out that when you're a new creation as Paul talks about to the Corinthian Church in 2 Corinthians 5 how that you have a new life of righteousness and that that that in fact is you are now in Union with God in Union with God you talk about new a new creation th this is a this is the renewal of a person's entire identity and not only your entire identity but a whole renewal of your entire purpose do you Embrace that here tonight friends you say oh I I I thank you for saving me Lord see you in heaven nothing you're a new creation in Christ your whole identity's changed your whole purpose is new this isn't a social gospel you didn't come here just to believe some Doctrine you come here to receive eternal life you come to have a friend in Jesus you come to have he's going to share his kingdom with you why would he let you why would he give you to share his kingdom and you keep your own purpose what who would do that you want to keep your own purpose and your own identity and and who you were you don't want to you don't want to change or be changed see so when you're going to become a new creation in Christ This is a renewal of your entire identity we find out that God has reconciled all things to himself that's beautiful in Colossians 1 because it explains that when God reconciled all things to himself then our past sins no longer Define us what what a friend we have in Jesus think about that friends that that when you're reconciled because God God reconciled you to himself now all your past sins I don't care what they were they no longer Define you amen you don't owe the devil nothing you don't have to explain nothing you from here on you don't have to account for nothing you don't need to please him you don't need a treaty with him you're a new creation in Christ old things have passed away you don't need anybody's permission to be happy you don't need anybody's permission to have faith you don't need anybody's permission to have peace that passes understanding you can have all things of from the kingdom of God he's a help in time of trouble as we found out in Psalms 46 he's a refuge and a strength very present help he's full of love and compassion Psalms 103 the Lord is compassionate and gracious slow to anger abounding in love we found out that that that that when a wicked person he tells Ezekiel in the 18th chapter where it said that if a wicked person turns from their sins is all you got to do turn from your sins turn your eyes Eyes Upon Jesus look full in his wonderful face you know what happen the things of this world will grow strangely dim they just begin to lose their appeal you don't you don't like them anymore you don't want that kind of stuff anymore you a you actually get to a point where you turn and he said whoever will do that whoever is W whoever is a wicked person if they'll just but turn from their sins they will live and not die I'm giving you the word of the Creator turn from your Wicked Ways say I've been pretty wicked just turn say but if you only knew what I've done well if God gets a hold of your life nobody's ever going to know because it's going to go out completely off the records and annals of human history and on the other side I'm going to tell you something friend you'll never have to get an account for any of that stuff amen friendship with God my what a friend we have in Jesus we're partakers of his kingdom he's a help in time of trouble he's Lo loving and compassionate he forgives sins he has every provision you know thing everything that you'd expect from a friend who cared about you and had the power to do something about it you know in our text when I think about Mary you know Mary knew like no other could really Mary knew what couldn't be fully explained now Mary could tell what was said she could relate the story she tried to tell everybody she told Joseph told her family told the community but nobody believed her Mary actually could could you know could go over it verbatim she could actually write a record of it and say I was in my room it was this certain time on this certain day and and you know the the Bible only gives us a little bit of the idea of the time of it but Mary could have actually detailed out it was about 70 degrees in Palestine and it was coming on to evening and I had just had my supper and I was in my room suddenly I heard a noise and and suddenly a dimensional window opened in my room and a man stepped through it Mary could explain it she could tell what was said to her she could she could make plain the teaching she could dot every eye she could cross every tea but that's not the same as as having the experience I want you to understand that Mary which is a type of us the perfect type of the bride at the end time had to go through it Mary had to experience it it it wasn't I mean isn't that where we are sometimes we we try to teach somebody Doctrine we try to answer their questions what is it you believe where do you go to church what do you teach there what and you you try to tell them well this that and the other well what about this well you know the Bible says well well what's this about a prophet well the Bible says and we can tell all about it we can even tell our testimony we can say you know the Lord revealed it to me and I was in a bar and the Lord came and met me and brought me out and brought me to this glorious truth and and you you can actually dot the eyes and cross the tees but but that's still somebody hearing your words they're still not experiencing they hear your words you can teach them the words but there you got to go through this you got to be here it's not going to be enough friends on the other side it's not going to be that I'm I'm going to they're going to say remember brother B talks about how that that last group that Leota group how that there will be such a hush go over the people that let the Bride of leot SE arise and when the Bride of leot arises what an a struck scene then the people will say how how did you make it we looked in that age and we thought it's so dark no one could survive it and here you are how did you do it and you're not going to try to teach them the seventh seal you're not going to talk to them about water baptism you're going to say I don't really know all all I know is I went through it and I kept going and I kept pressing and something wouldn't let me go I experienced it I'm here because of an experience that I had she knew like no other Mary knew that she you know the she knew she hadn't been touched Mary knew that nobody believed her but she knew like no other that she didn't do that she hadn't started it Mary Knew by experience she hadn't started it and she knew by experience she couldn't stop it she told everybody about it she endured all that came by from people who didn't believe it and couldn't understand it all the questions all the slander you know something we deal with that today all the questions all the false accusations all the slander you know but Mary's my type Mary couldn't worry about that I can't worry about that Mary knew she needed you know what Mary knew Mary knew she needed to take steps to make sure that this was a healthy pregnancy and a healthy delivery I I I'm bringing forth the Son of God I'm bringing forth the Christ child I'm bringing forth the word I ain't got time to listen to slander I ain't got time to worry about criticism I'm not going to answer every question I'm saying this I'm bringing forth the word of God get out of my way let every devil be silent she she to you know to all she could do was all she could do that's all she could do he would have to do the rest you ever feel like that I'm going to tell you something friends he called me he called you I'm doing the best I can you're doing the best you you can I'm here to tell you he'll just have to do the rest that's all I know that's what Ruth knew that's what Esther knew Ruth knew that Ruth trusted Boaz and Naomi said now daughter rest because the man will not rest until he has finished I got somebody who's working on my behalf and I'm here to trust him oh my while the supernatural pregnancy was you know it would not be easy it was Supernatural it was the power of God but it wasn't going to be easy what what do we want sometimes yeah brother brother Brandon would often you know quote that poem and it's actually a lengthy poem it's very beautiful and he would often just quote that brother brandham loved poetry and he would quote that one part over and over and over you know must I uh be on a flowery bed of eeds While others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody Seas is that what we want life don't go our way so we we get all upset we get all you know destroyed in our faith and and are we Grumble oh you got a friend you got a friend friends and let me tell you something he's such a friend that even when you're sitting over in a corner pouting he's still working on you he's still working working on you and sometimes I'm so glad sometimes I get up out of my pouty corner and I'm bleeding and I'm bruised up and I go what in the world he's been working on me he don't care I can pout all I want to but he's still perfecting me this thing is Supernatural it ain't going to be easy but it is going to work it is going to happen I am going in a Rapture you are going in a Rapture there's not enough devils in hell that can yeah the physical things Mary would have to go through the social things she would have to endure the psychological trials would be epic she was she was making a claim that was was unfounded in history this is ridiculous Mary no human has ever done what you're saying but Abraham knew in Genesis 22 when he called the place Jehovah Gyra he knew the Lord would provide amen God's provision and blessing are established in the New Testament Philippians 4 my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus hey you believe that I mean either you do or you don't my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus Philippians 4:19 Malachi 3:10 God promises to open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing Mary was going to need a a door to open in heaven Mary was going to need that dimensional Doorway to open this age needed that he said I I I he set an open door at the end of the Philadelphian age right in that lap over time going into the leoan age because that open door anytime God opens the a door in heaven anytime you see the heavens open that's always God bringing a revelation that's what Mary was going to need see that's what happened that's what Ezekiel Saw Ezekiel standing by the river chebar and he said the heavens were opened and what was happening started bringing down a revelation next thing you know Ezekiel starts talking about those that Amber color starts talking about those living creatures those cherubs around the throne starts describing the throne what does it do an Open Door starts bringing a revelation what what what happened with what happened with John the Baptist John the Baptist is standing there and the heavens opened and the spirit of God descended and gave him a revelation this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell what what did Stephen see he said I see see Heavens open and the Christ sitting on the right hand it was a revelation the last thing that God did what did Peter see he saw the heavens open and a net let down with every kind of unclean beast and he said Lord I'll not touch that it's unclean the Lord said don't you call unclean what I have cleansed see so so John John comes to the End of the Age we at the End of the Age and and and and brother B shows it how that at the end of chapter three he the church goes up and and and and you see John a door is open in heaven and so the church goes up brother R said the church goes up at the end of chapter 3 because that's the end of leoa meaning there's not going to be another church age and she's not seen again until Revelation 19 when what happens the heavens are opened and out she comes see you see and that that was a that was and what would that be to the world a revelation of the Bride of Jesus Christ you you understand that so so brother brandham explains that in chapter four and five God C the Lord is showing how he pulled it off how he got that church perfected how he was moving all the time in the church now he had already showed that in Revelation 2 and Revelation three but we were coming to a day that was unique a day that unlike any other day just like Mary to an impossible time to a Time unprecedented in human history where where Lucifer listen here's where you live you want to you better have a friend in Jesus you're living living in an age that's Satan's Eden no other age faced that Satan's now had 6,000 years to build his Eden just like God had 6,000 to build his Lucifer has been elected by the people to be the god of the age that's never happened th this is a time of the great apostasy this is the time of the man of sin being revealed th this is the time when the dead in Christ come forth and the bride is perfected and taken and arest oh friends what an hour that we live in and this is exactly what would happen to H this is what would have to happen for Mary it would it would literally take the opening of Heaven to her and an angel stepping through a door and coming from that world into her world with a message of Grace that's exactly what's happened to you she was told she was told we read it in our text you read it with me you are highly favored friends when when she's told she's highly favored remember that Grace you're you're highly favored we know that Grace is the unmar favor of God so what was he saying to Mary Mary you're highly graced that's why the prophet said in this day that's why Mary's such a type because the headstone comes crying Grace Grace unto it you are highly graced say I got a weakness you're highly graced I don't know how I can pull it off you can't he can you're highly favored this is his doing no wonder she was a type for our day all she could do was keep going all she could do was just keep holding on I I asked brother Matt he's gonna sing it here right as I'm get ready to close I I said Matt I want you to sing that song you know uh I just held on I love some of these words you ask me how it is that I'm still standing you wonder how I made it through this storm I can't boast of any special powers there's no secret I just held on Amen and I held on till the storm was over I don't claim to be a hero and I don't have all the answers but I held on till the storm was over not because I'm good not because I'm great not because I'm strong I just held on oh Mary held on Friends it wasn't easy what else could she do what else can you do she she you know she when I think about that bride there in Revelation 19 and she literally rode out with Jesus it's almost like a western turn term like yeah I wrote out with you know I wrote out with text you know we went after the bad guy you know they they they they they they rode out with him say where where' the bride go oh they rote out with the Lord is that what you want to do oh they it reminds me of that of that little cousin that elect lady remember and and the boy was building her house in Chicago and she just waited and the cousins they laughed at her and it didn't matter but I'm here to tell you when that bug board rolled up and she jumped in she just held on and those cousin said how'd you do it I just held on I held on oh Hallelujah friends I I remember I remember uh sister Dorothy told me one time she said she said you know what Mason did Mason was this a little bitty guy and and and he was a little Alca ter terrorist when he was at that age and and he sister Dorthy said you won't believe what Mason did I said sister Dorothy if it's Mason I'll probably believe it what'd he do she said we pulled up pulled up over over here in the parking lot and she said and we got out of the car and he he he took off running and so when when Mason was telling the story he was telling the story I think to his parents and he said Grandma started yelling to me and they said what did what did Grandma yell and just a little guy he said Grandma said Mason come back oh this bride's going to ride off into the sunset friends how' we doing it I just held on I I wasn't great I wasn't strong I just held on that's what they did they came out of the they came out of the heavens what happened the world was about to get a revelation of the true Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ oh we got a friend in Jesus that's who I'm holding on to tonight tonight that's who I'm inviting you to hold on to tonight you got to be like Mary say it's not going to be easy I I can't explain it all I don't have all the answers but he said it and I believe it and that settles it and be it unto me according to his word I can't do it he'll have to do it is that the kind of friend you want tonight friend are you happy to have a Divine friend oh let's stand to our feet and thank this Divine friend have our musicians come back and sing song brother Matt I want you to get ready to sing that song for me my my my my all she could do was hold on our lives are right there today friends we are in no less way bringing forth the Christ child just like Mary the same way in many way and and in fact is I would say that in many ways even more impossibly so even more impossibly so there's there's so much more to stop us that then there was to stop Mary I'm glad to report to you today it can't be stopped thank god let's raise up our hands and say thank God it can't be stopped I can't be stopped the word can't be stopped Psalms 118:23 this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in my eyes in our eyes I just say it like this this is my friends doing and it's marvelous in my eyes I have that friend I hope you know him I hope you know the one that I've spent two two Services getting you to understand this friend who can do anything who is all powerful who is full of love full of compassion forgives all your sins makes you a new creation regenerates your life changes your identity changes your whole purpose is finishing the task listen you you're never going to be able don't worry about it you're never going to be able to explain everything you're going to have to experience it you're going to have to go through it but but the beauty of it is that there's eternal life waiting at the end of it this can't be stopped and I would say to you tonight don't hinder it don't hinder it let him have his way how many are willing to do that tonight say Lord I want to let you have your way you're my faithful friend you're the closest friend I'll ever have you're the all powerful all knowing all wise all caring friend let's bow our heads just before brother Matt sings Lord God I love having you as my friend I I I I confess Lord there's been many times just like Mary I've said how can this be I've had to look at my own failures in bitter anguish and say how in the world can this be how will I ever bring forth the Perfection of the word and and bring this body and mind so subject to God that it'll one day be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye Lord I have resolved so many times that the answer is I can't do it I just can't I'd like to be able to say I could but I'm just like Mary all I can say is be it unto me according to your word she said behold the hands made of the Lord in other words here I stand I can do nothing more you've said it you're the one showed up you're the one who stepped through that dimensional doorway you opened Heavens to me he opened heaven to us friend he gave us a revelation of his word if he loves us that much will he not finish this job oh Master Lord this world so impossible and I I say again Lord our our task is even more difficult even more impossible than Mary's all she was doing was bringing forth a natural child that's god brother brandham said even the even the human natural birth was more amazing than what Mary did that I I have never thought to say that that's what a prophet said a human birth is more amazing than what happened to Mary cuz brother bam said because that's just God God can do anything but how does a man and a woman come together seed is exchanged an egg is fertilized and a child grows from it and becomes a human being with a living Soul how this Mystery of Life Lord how much more incredible will it be that a bride can go down in in the into the history books this Bride of the last day that she came on the scene in a time of impossibility of complete darkness total apostasy even Christ even put out of his own church Satan elected by the people to be the god of the age impossible total Satan's Eden with control over every facet and every aspect of our human lives and we walk around in this impossible Darkness yet your word Can't Fail thank you all I can do is believe your word all I can do is hold on today and hold on on tomorrow and hold on the next day and hold on the next Lord I'll be holding on on that morning oh that morning breaks Eternal bright and fair I'll be holding on Lord hallelujah when they came out of Heaven they were riding white horses they were

special time for me and I never want to fail to give him praise and to never forget the wonderful thing that he did in my life and not only did he Heal Me from cancer but he gave me such a wonderful experience of his goodness and to go through something so it wasn't the cancer that actually was so bad it was the treatment even though I didn't he he healed me on that first treatment he still didn't give me permission to go off of the treatments for a while and through that I was like there's been there were so many days I can go back and I can just say Lord your promise that came to me in the middle of a service that said you're going to go through something but you're going to be okay I got to experience a faith that Rose above anything that Satan could put on me there was no fear I can say that 100% I went through that with no fear and it was in the dark times when I was hurting and suffering that he comforted me um with that promise and I don't know it just means so much to me amen and then there's a there's somebody in my life that means everything it's gone through a very dark hard time it's been so painful to watch that person suffer and I know that God was going to bring this person through this and he was going to use it for this person's good I have had such comfort with that but it doesn't take away having to watch somebody suffer but in the middle of it I just God has given me a little glimpse of some life light yeah praise God that's come into this situation and now that light is just give me such excitement to think that I mean there's a day and an hour for this person absolutely yeah complete deliverance I know it God's already this is promised and it's coming and I know these little glimpses of light right now mean so much to me and I just want to say thank you Lord Lord and I know that you started the work and you'll finish it that's right so I just give him praise amen praise the Lord anybody else before we go amen praise the Lord
