[29:07] we had him yesterday morning at the

[29:11] what a time we had in the word i i
[29:13] rarely
[29:14] see all the brothers everybody wanting
[29:16] to chime in and say something i never
[29:17] saw so many angles
[29:19] on a on a book out of the bible only 25
[29:22] verses long the book of philemon
[29:24] but brother ernie had it rolling
[29:26] yesterday it was fantastic
[29:28] amen so let's sing some more that as we
[29:30] invite him to come
[29:31] amen and bring us the word today amen
[29:41] [Music]
[29:49] revealing the son of man
[29:59] [Music]
[30:06] soon
[30:20] sing with me however
[30:38] [Applause]
[30:41] amen god bless your saints
[30:45] you know his brother jason was saying
[30:47] we've got to enter
[30:48] into that supernatural realm and
[30:52] a believer is a super intelligent being
[30:56] with a divine purpose in their life
[31:00] and brother branham loved to use the
[31:01] word the mystical
[31:04] and the definition of a mystic and i
[31:06] trust that we're all mystics here today
[31:09] a mystic is one who seeks after and
[31:13] attains direct intercourse
[31:16] with god and
[31:19] there is only one truth there is only
[31:23] one sanity in this entire world
[31:26] and unfortunately 99.99
[31:30] of the people in the world do not know
[31:32] what you know
[31:34] and that's god's doing if it was me when
[31:37] i first come to the message i was fresh
[31:39] out of pentecost and i was
[31:41] you know i was wanting everybody to see
[31:43] this message
[31:44] and then one time i was i was reading a
[31:47] message
[31:48] and brother branham said sometimes you
[31:50] have to say
[31:51] things in such a way as to cause people
[31:53] to go
[31:54] away and i'm saying whoa
[31:57] he said you have to get rid of the
[31:59] creepers
[32:01] and there sure were a whole bunch of
[32:03] creepers
[32:04] that were running around brother
[32:05] branham's ministry
[32:07] hundreds of thousands of them in america
[32:09] and take millions of them around the
[32:11] world
[32:12] that started off with the message but
[32:14] they never
[32:15] finished the course so i'd like to
[32:18] invite you to turn in the book of
[32:20] leviticus
[32:22] we're going to look at chapter 2 and
[32:24] start reading
[32:25] at verse 1 and and you know i i don't
[32:29] like to plead
[32:30] with people but i'm pleading with you
[32:34] that you pinch yourself or
[32:37] or do whatever you have to do but really
[32:40] concentrate on the beginning
[32:42] of the message because if you miss the
[32:45] beginning
[32:46] at the end you're going to wonder where
[32:48] in the world
[32:49] did all this come from or where did it
[32:51] end up to
[32:52] and it's personal to you personal to me
[32:56] personal to every son and daughter of
[32:58] god that's
[32:59] living on this earth this is a personal
[33:03] supernatural mystical message
[33:06] okay so in leviticus chapter two in
[33:09] verse 1.
[33:11] the sweet savant savor offerings these
[33:15] are
[33:15] the meat offerings or the sweet
[33:17] offerings
[33:19] leviticus chapter 2. i'm just saying
[33:21] that these are the sweet offerings
[33:26] and when one will offer a meat offering
[33:29] unto the lord
[33:30] his offering shall be a fine flower
[33:33] and he shall pour oil upon it and put
[33:36] frankincense
[33:37] thereon
[33:40] and he shall bring it to aaron's son the
[33:42] priest and he shall take it thereout
[33:45] and the handful of the flower thereof
[33:47] and of the oil
[33:48] thereof with all the frankincense
[33:51] thereof and the priest shall burn the
[33:53] memorial of it upon the altar
[33:55] to be an offering made by fire of
[33:58] a sweet savor unto the lord and the
[34:01] remnant
[34:02] of the meat offering shall be aarons and
[34:04] his sons it is a thing most holy of the
[34:07] offerings of the lord made by fire
[34:09] and if thou bring an oblation of a meat
[34:11] offering bacon in the oven
[34:13] it shall be of unleavened cakes a fine
[34:17] flower mingle with oil
[34:18] of unleavened wafers anointed with oil
[34:22] and if the oblation be a meat offering
[34:24] bacon in a pan
[34:25] it shall be a fine flour unleavened
[34:27] mingle with oil
[34:29] thou shall part it in pieces and pour
[34:31] oil thereon
[34:32] it is a meat offering and if thou
[34:34] oblation be a meat offering bacon in the
[34:36] frying pan
[34:37] it shall be made a fine flour with oil
[34:40] and thou shall bring the meat offering
[34:42] that is made
[34:44] by these things unto the lord and when
[34:46] it is presented
[34:48] unto the priest he shall bring it unto
[34:50] the altar now drop down to verse 11
[34:54] no meat offering which we shall bring
[34:56] unto the lord
[34:57] shall be made with leaven very important
[35:01] no leaven
[35:03] for ye shall burn no leaven nor any
[35:06] honey
[35:07] so no leaven and no honey
[35:11] in any offering of the lord made by fire
[35:14] and that the oblation of
[35:18] in thy oblation of the firstfruits
[35:22] ye shall offer them unto the lord
[35:25] but they shall not be burnt on the altar
[35:28] for a sweet savor
[35:30] and every oblation of thy meat offering
[35:33] shalt of season with salt
[35:35] neither shalt thou suffer the salt of
[35:38] the covenant
[35:39] of thy god to be lacking from thy meat
[35:42] offering
[35:44] with all thine offerings thou shalt
[35:46] offer
[35:47] salt god bless you let's pray
[35:56] father we know that this book that we
[35:59] hold in our hands
[36:01] it is a supernatural book
[36:05] it's a book that you inspired
[36:08] 40 different authors to pen 66
[36:12] books over many many decades
[36:16] of history and now we see that each one
[36:20] of these books it comes together this is
[36:23] your
[36:24] divine supernatural love story that you
[36:27] had
[36:27] in your mind before the foundation of
[36:29] the world
[36:30] and now we're coming down to the climax
[36:33] of this great tremendous
[36:35] drama and we're so thankful that you
[36:38] have allowed us
[36:40] and you have trusted us to live in this
[36:43] age
[36:44] knowing that we would overcome by the
[36:46] great message that you have sent to us
[36:48] in this day
[36:50] so i pray today that you would bless
[36:52] both speaker
[36:53] and hearer and that that no man would be
[36:56] glorified but only you
[36:58] and your word and your power and your
[37:00] august presence would be
[37:02] manifest amongst us and we ask these
[37:04] blessings
[37:05] with a great confidence for we ask them
[37:08] in your precious name
[37:09] of our lord jesus christ amen amen
[37:13] god bless you you can have your seats
[37:18] now in the beginning i i encourage you
[37:21] to pay
[37:22] attention to all the ingredients that
[37:24] were going to go
[37:26] into the offering you had fine flour
[37:30] and brother branham talked about that
[37:32] flour he talked about a device they had
[37:34] it was called the burr
[37:36] a b-u-r-r and he refers to it 28 times
[37:40] and somehow that brewer when they took
[37:42] the grain they would take that grain and
[37:44] grind it
[37:45] and every single piece came out the same
[37:48] size and we'll first refer to that a
[37:50] little bit later
[37:51] so it had to be fine flour and then
[37:54] there had to be oil
[37:55] and the oil had to be mixed with it and
[37:58] it had to be mixed up real good
[38:00] so there was no lumps in it and then
[38:03] there had to be
[38:04] added frankincense because frankincense
[38:06] it was the most
[38:07] precious and one of the most costly
[38:10] fragrances
[38:11] that there was and the secret of
[38:13] frankincense was
[38:15] it only was released when heat was
[38:18] applied to it
[38:19] and then we're told don't put any leaven
[38:22] in there we know that leaven is sin
[38:25] don't put any honey
[38:26] in there because when you heat honey it
[38:29] it it sours it it begins to ferment
[38:32] so don't put any honey in this offering
[38:35] and with this offering
[38:37] you shall offer salt because salt
[38:40] is a preservative so this is the meal
[38:43] offering
[38:44] and it's way back in leviticus and now
[38:47] god
[38:47] begins to point us now if we can turn in
[38:50] our bibles
[38:51] to the book of first kings
[38:56] we'll start reading at chapter 16
[39:00] and uh just a a little bit of a lengthy
[39:03] reading but i want to just lay a
[39:04] foundation
[39:06] in the 30 and first year of ask the king
[39:10] of judah began
[39:11] christ to reign over israel 12 years
[39:14] he reigned a 12 year six year
[39:18] he reigned in terza and he brought the
[39:21] hill samaria of shima
[39:23] for two talents of silver and built on
[39:25] the hill
[39:26] and called the name of the city which he
[39:28] built
[39:29] after the name of shima owner of the
[39:32] hill samaria
[39:33] but now here's here's where we need to
[39:35] pay real
[39:36] strict attention because sometimes one
[39:39] paragraph sometimes one sentence or one
[39:42] word
[39:43] it just opens up a whole paradigm of
[39:46] what god is trying to show to us
[39:48] so he says but omri wrought evil
[39:51] in the sight of the lord and did worse
[39:55] than all a-l-l
[39:58] this king did worse than all
[40:02] that were before him so this was a bad
[40:05] man
[40:09] for he walked in all the ways of
[40:11] jeroboam the sons of nabat
[40:13] and in sin wherewith he made israel
[40:17] to sin to provoke the lord god of israel
[40:20] to anger with vanities
[40:22] now the rest of the acts of omri
[40:25] which he did and his might that he
[40:28] showed
[40:29] are they not written in the book of
[40:30] chronicles of the king
[40:32] of israel
[40:36] so omri slept with his fathers and was
[40:38] buried in samaria
[40:40] and ahab his son reigned in his stead
[40:44] and in the thirty and eighth year of
[40:46] assa king of judah
[40:50] began ahab the son of omri to reign over
[40:54] israel and ahab the son of omri reigned
[40:58] over israel and
[40:59] samaria twenty and two years
[41:02] and ahab the son of omri did
[41:06] evil in the sight of the lord
[41:09] above all that were before him
[41:14] so the wickedness is getting greater and
[41:17] greater
[41:18] and greater and it came to pass
[41:22] as if it had been a light thing for him
[41:23] to walk in the sins of jeroboam the sins
[41:26] of nabat
[41:26] that he took to wife jezebel
[41:32] a heathen a pagan
[41:38] took to wife jezebel this daughter of
[41:40] ethbell king of the zidonians
[41:43] and went and served baal
[41:46] and worshiped him this is the king of
[41:48] israel
[41:49] marries a pagan wife and right away
[41:52] we find out who's wearing the pants in
[41:54] that family
[41:55] and right away he's over there
[41:57] worshiping her god
[42:00] baal
[42:03] and he reared up an altar for bale in
[42:05] the house of baal
[42:07] which he had built in samaria and ahab
[42:10] made a grove and ahab did more
[42:13] to provoke the lord god of israel to
[42:15] anger
[42:16] than all the kings of israel
[42:19] that were before him
[42:23] so now this is israel this is god's
[42:26] chosen people
[42:27] but bad leaders rose up amongst them
[42:31] israel you know god had given israel
[42:34] that land
[42:35] he had driven he had driven the
[42:37] inhabitants
[42:38] off of the land to give it to the
[42:40] children of israel
[42:42] and america was the same way god gave
[42:46] america
[42:47] to the pilgrims religious freedom
[42:50] and america rose up and they had great
[42:52] leaders like george washington and
[42:54] abraham lincoln
[42:56] and and we see that as time progressed
[42:59] things got worse and worse and worse and
[43:02] worse
[43:02] as far as people who were dedicated to
[43:05] christ
[43:06] america was founded on christian
[43:08] principles
[43:09] now if you try to say that you'll have
[43:12] rioters and protesters outside your door
[43:15] if you try to say that america is a
[43:17] christian nation
[43:18] and jesus christ is the head of this
[43:21] nation
[43:23] so now because sin has entered into the
[43:26] land
[43:26] we look at chapter 17 of
[43:29] first kings very familiar scripture
[43:32] and elijah the tishbite who was of the
[43:35] inhabitants of gilead
[43:36] said unto ahab as the lord god of israel
[43:39] liveth
[43:40] before whom i stand there shall not be
[43:43] dew nor rain
[43:44] these years but according to my word
[43:47] now try to imagine ahab and jezebel
[43:51] sitting there and and this that this guy
[43:53] comes out of nowhere we don't know where
[43:55] he's from we don't know
[43:56] we don't even know how we get in who let
[43:58] this guy in here
[43:59] why was this man even allowed into my
[44:01] presence and look at the fool
[44:04] the fool saying that there's going to be
[44:06] no rain
[44:07] until this idiot calls for the rain
[44:10] imagine something so preposterous
[44:14] and the rain stopped
[44:19] and the word of the lord came unto him
[44:20] saying get thee hence
[44:22] and turn thou eastward and hide thy self
[44:25] by the brook chariot that is before
[44:26] jordan
[44:27] and it shall be that thou shalt drink of
[44:31] the brook
[44:31] and i have commanded the ravens to feed
[44:34] thee and he went and did according unto
[44:35] the word of the lord
[44:36] for he went and dwelt by the brook
[44:39] chariot that is before jordan
[44:40] and the ravens brought him bread and
[44:43] flesh in the morning
[44:45] and bread and flesh in the evening and
[44:47] he drank of the brook
[44:48] now you have to be a mystic
[44:52] you have to be one who believes in the
[44:54] supernatural to believe
[44:55] that god sent his prophet up to the
[44:58] brook cherith
[44:59] and every day room service came in
[45:03] bread and flesh in the morning bread and
[45:05] flesh in the evening
[45:06] and it was brought in by birds
[45:10] now brother branham said you might ask
[45:12] where did those birds
[45:14] get the bread and the flesh to feed
[45:17] elijah
[45:18] and brother branham said the same place
[45:20] that jesus got the bread
[45:21] to feed all those thousands that he had
[45:24] to feed
[45:25] so that's not that's not a difficult
[45:27] thing for god
[45:28] to do that you know when some people
[45:31] think about god they think about jesus
[45:33] and
[45:34] and the man who suffered on the cross
[45:36] and it's good to think about that
[45:38] but when you go back before the
[45:40] foundation of the world
[45:41] when god decided that he wanted to make
[45:43] a world he just said
[45:45] let there be and all the trillions of
[45:48] stars and planets and galaxies
[45:50] he just said let there be that's the god
[45:54] that i
[45:54] serve that's the god that i fall down
[45:57] before
[45:57] that's the god that i want to interact
[46:00] with that's the god that i want to live
[46:02] inside of me
[46:03] that's the god that tells me all things
[46:05] are possible
[46:09] so now the brook dries up
[46:15] and the word of the lord came unto him
[46:17] saying arise get thee to zero path
[46:20] which belongeth to zidon and
[46:23] dwell there behold i have commanded a
[46:25] widow woman to sustain thee
[46:28] now this widow woman she did not have a
[46:30] clue
[46:31] that she had been commanded to serve
[46:34] this guy that was coming
[46:36] brother branham was in a time machine
[46:38] you know the
[46:39] if you're in a submarine and the
[46:41] submarine wants to know what's going on
[46:43] above the water
[46:44] they have a periscope and that periscope
[46:46] goes up there and they can look all
[46:48] around
[46:48] well in this day god has given to us a
[46:51] prophet scope
[46:53] and god's prophets they were prophet
[46:55] scopes and god could take them and he
[46:57] could point them backward
[46:58] and tell them what has happened he could
[47:01] point him and tell him what is happening
[47:02] or he could point them forward and tell
[47:04] them what is going to happen
[47:06] and god told elijah i have commanded a
[47:09] widow woman
[47:10] and she's going to sustain thee so
[47:13] elijah
[47:14] he goes he goes walking down there and
[47:16] he went to zeropath
[47:18] maybe he came across a little picket
[47:20] fence there that he'd seen
[47:21] in the dream and when he came
[47:25] to the gate of the city behold the
[47:28] woman was there gathering
[47:31] sticks and he called to her
[47:35] and said fetch me i pray thee a little
[47:37] water and a vessel that i may drink
[47:41] and as she was going to fetch it now
[47:44] brother jason
[47:46] there is a famine and a drought and the
[47:49] most precious commodity
[47:51] right there in that land was water
[47:55] and here's this perfect stranger he
[47:57] comes up to a widow woman
[47:59] and he says hey get me a drink of water
[48:05] and she turned and she started going
[48:08] to get the water
[48:13] but then he adds to it
[48:18] he said fetch me i pray thee a little
[48:20] water in a vessel
[48:22] that i may drink and as she was going to
[48:24] fetch it he called to her
[48:26] and said bring me i pray the amorsal of
[48:30] bread
[48:31] in thine hand now that stopped her
[48:34] right there she turned around
[48:38] and she said to him as the lord thy god
[48:40] liveth i have not a cake
[48:42] but a handful of meal in a barrel and a
[48:45] little
[48:46] oil and a cruise and behold i am
[48:48] gathering
[48:50] two sticks not three sticks not four
[48:53] sticks
[48:54] she was gathering two sticks she had a
[48:56] little bit of meal
[48:57] and she had a little bit of oil and she
[49:00] was gathering
[49:01] two sticks and her testimony is
[49:08] i am gathering the two sticks that i may
[49:11] go in
[49:12] and dress it for me and my son
[49:15] that we may go and die
[49:20] that's desperation friends
[49:23] now i studied i've studied this message
[49:27] brother branham loves to tell the story
[49:29] and and i've searched all through the
[49:31] message and the things i'm going to
[49:32] share with you
[49:33] are not in all one paragraph where
[49:36] you'll be able to find them in the
[49:37] message but as you search through them
[49:39] you will find brother branham talking
[49:41] about the little widow woman
[49:43] and again this is not a guess this
[49:46] is a prophet looking in time
[49:49] looking and seeing exactly what was
[49:52] going through
[49:53] he says the little widow woman was the
[49:55] poorest
[49:56] of the pores she was weary unable to
[50:00] sleep all night she was tossed about
[50:02] because
[50:02] of this great tragedy big tears dripping
[50:05] from her eyes
[50:06] for many weeks listen listen to this
[50:10] for many weeks
[50:13] she'd had only one meal every
[50:17] three or four days
[50:22] and remember she's got a little baby
[50:24] also
[50:26] her husband had been lost in the battle
[50:27] for the lord he trusted god and gave
[50:30] his life for the cause of israel he was
[50:33] a gentile
[50:33] and this woman she's a gentile also
[50:38] her ragged nightgown was just about gone
[50:41] her sleeves were all ragged and her arms
[50:43] sticking out of them
[50:45] she lived decent and honorable and met
[50:47] all of god's requirements
[50:48] but still the lord remained silent
[50:52] her shoulders were stooped as she sat in
[50:54] her rocking chair
[50:56] shedding big tears and looking at her
[50:59] starving baby
[51:01] her cheekbones sticking out her arms
[51:04] frail
[51:04] as she sat ringing her bony hands the
[51:07] bones were dwindling away
[51:10] as the flesh goes from them
[51:14] she knew that only a handful of meals
[51:17] stood between her
[51:18] and death and then brother branham drops
[51:21] us in
[51:22] she wasn't going to eat of the cake she
[51:24] was going to bake
[51:26] she was going to feed her little baby
[51:28] and put him
[51:29] in her arms and die
[51:33] that's desperation this woman and this
[51:36] little boy
[51:37] they were spiritual skeletons
[51:40] there had been no rain for three and a
[51:43] half
[51:43] years and where there's no rain there's
[51:46] a famine
[51:47] there's drought and where there's a
[51:50] famine and drought people go
[51:51] hungry and if it continues they starve
[51:54] and starvation is one of the most
[51:56] horrible deaths
[51:57] you can ever witness some of you may
[52:00] have seen pictures of africa when they
[52:02] had those famines
[52:04] and those little boys and girls running
[52:05] around and looked like
[52:07] skeletons with skin stretched over them
[52:10] with no hope and by the thousands they
[52:12] died day
[52:13] by day by day because there was no
[52:16] nourishment coming in
[52:18] he talks about the little boy he said
[52:20] the boy was three or four years old
[52:22] he was unable to sleep over 20 minutes
[52:25] at a time
[52:26] because of his hunger he had on a ragged
[52:28] night shirt
[52:30] he had sinking cheeks his eyes were
[52:33] turning yellow
[52:34] and he was holding his stomach as he
[52:37] asked his mother
[52:38] if she was ready to bake the little cake
[52:43] then the conditions in the land the
[52:46] whole nation was starving and in a
[52:48] terrible condition
[52:50] the people in the city of zarepath were
[52:52] starving to death
[52:53] screaming for water it was a reflection
[52:56] of sin and
[52:57] immorality as the woman looked down the
[53:00] street
[53:00] she heard the people cursing and
[53:03] carrying on
[53:04] a world in insanity
[53:08] and so now we see that when the woman
[53:12] says i've only got
[53:13] just a little bit of a meal in a barrel
[53:16] and a little bit of oil
[53:18] and i'm gathering these two sticks that
[53:20] i might cook it
[53:21] and me and my son can go and die
[53:24] and elijah said unto him fear not go and
[53:28] do as thou has said
[53:30] but make me there of a little cake first
[53:32] and bring it unto me
[53:33] and after make for thee and for thy son
[53:36] for
[53:37] thus saith the lord god of israel
[53:40] you know those are the sweetest words
[53:42] that that woman ever heard
[53:44] in her life she knew the story she knew
[53:47] why there was a drought and a famine
[53:49] she knew that elijah had gone and elijah
[53:52] had spoken to the king
[53:53] and he's the one that called for the
[53:55] famine and now she perceived that this
[53:57] was a holy man
[53:59] and when he said thus saith the lord god
[54:01] of israel
[54:02] she knew that god had come to rescue her
[54:05] in her skeletal condition and her little
[54:08] boy
[54:10] amen
[54:16] the barrel of meal shall not waste
[54:19] neither shall the cruse of oil fail
[54:21] until the day that the lord sendeth rain
[54:23] upon the earth
[54:24] and she went and did according to the
[54:26] saying of elijah and she
[54:28] and he and her home did eat many days
[54:30] and the barrel of meal wasted not
[54:33] neither did the crews of oil fail
[54:35] according to the word of the lord
[54:38] which he spoke by elijah now think about
[54:41] that she made that first cake
[54:43] and she went and she gave it to elijah
[54:46] the prophet
[54:47] she was willing to sacrifice everything
[54:51] she had that's all she had and she was
[54:54] willing to give it
[54:55] upon his word that all was going to be
[54:58] well
[54:59] and her meal and her oil was never going
[55:02] to run out
[55:03] do you know from that time forth every
[55:06] single cake that she baked
[55:08] it was a miracle cake miracle cake after
[55:12] miracle cake after miracle cake after
[55:14] miracle cake
[55:15] she is baking miracle cakes out of what
[55:19] was
[55:19] empty in the barrel the cruise of oil
[55:22] everything was empty but she just kept
[55:24] baking
[55:24] and she kept baking and she kept baking
[55:27] and you know what
[55:28] every message book that you pick up
[55:31] friends
[55:32] this is a miracle cake and i wonder how
[55:35] many miracle cakes have we been eating
[55:38] recently what's your spiritual stamina
[55:41] like what's your strength what's your
[55:43] revelation like what's your
[55:45] insight like
[55:49] so now let's turn over to luke
[55:52] we're gonna look at chapter four
[56:05] now the beginning of chapter 4 jesus is
[56:08] going
[56:08] into the desert to be tempted of the
[56:11] devil
[56:12] 40 days and 40 nights without
[56:16] food without water
[56:19] and the devil doing his best to trick
[56:23] him up
[56:24] in his time of weakness in his time of
[56:28] of hunger and and the pains
[56:31] of no water
[56:34] so now in verse 12 we read
[56:39] and jesus answering said unto him it is
[56:42] said thou
[56:43] shalt not tempt the lord thy god and
[56:45] when the devil had
[56:47] ended all the temptation he departed
[56:50] from him
[56:51] for a season for a season he didn't
[56:54] leave permanently
[56:57] the devil was probably worn out
[57:01] forty days of this man with no food and
[57:04] no water and
[57:05] still i've done my best i've been
[57:08] deceiving man for four thousand years
[57:10] and i cannot get this guy not even a
[57:13] little bit
[57:15] so he left them for a season
[57:19] verse 14 and when jesus returned
[57:22] in the power of the spirit into galilee
[57:26] and they went out of fame of him through
[57:29] all the region
[57:30] round about and he taught in their
[57:32] synagogues being glorified
[57:34] of there's that word again being
[57:36] glorified of
[57:38] all if the bible said it was all
[57:41] it was all so the whole the whole
[57:44] area of galilee they had heard about the
[57:47] signs and the wonders and the miracles
[57:50] and he went into the synagogue and he
[57:52] taught being glorified of
[57:54] all and no doubt the group of people
[57:58] that were following him was getting
[57:59] greater and greater
[58:01] and the excitement level that the
[58:03] supernatural had come
[58:05] this is the first time that a prophet of
[58:08] god had visited
[58:09] israel in over 400 years and the people
[58:13] were excited
[58:20] but now jesus comes home
[58:25] homeboy makes good have you ever been in
[58:29] the area i lived in an
[58:30] area and and some celebrity came out of
[58:33] your area
[58:34] whether it was a politician or an actor
[58:36] or a singer
[58:38] or a sport oh yeah yeah he's from our
[58:39] area yeah yeah he
[58:41] he was right down the road maybe 50
[58:43] miles he was right in our area here
[58:45] everybody wants to be associated kind of
[58:48] like with a celebrity
[58:50] so here comes jesus homeboy makes good
[58:54] and he came to nazareth where he had
[58:57] been brought up
[58:58] and as his custom was he went into the
[59:00] synagogue on the sabbath day
[59:02] and stood up for the reed and there was
[59:05] delivered unto him the book of the
[59:07] prophet isaiah
[59:08] now remember jesus didn't go looking for
[59:10] a book
[59:11] they came and delivered him the book
[59:13] said okay here
[59:14] read out of isaiah
[59:22] and when he had opened the book he found
[59:25] the place where it is written
[59:27] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[59:30] because he hath
[59:31] anointed me to preach the gospel
[59:34] to the poor he has sent me to heal the
[59:37] brokenhearted
[59:38] to preach deliverance to the captives
[59:40] and recovering of sight to the blind
[59:42] to set at liberty those that are bruised
[59:45] to preach
[59:46] the acceptable year of the lord amen
[59:49] and he took the book and he handed it
[59:53] back to the minister
[59:55] now just try to put yourself in this
[59:57] picture
[59:58] you're sitting in a synagogue
[1:00:00] everything's going okay
[1:00:02] the minister comes we've heard about
[1:00:05] jesus and so the minister comes and
[1:00:07] hands him the books and we'd like for
[1:00:09] you to read
[1:00:10] today and and the bible said all the
[1:00:14] eyes were fastened upon him
[1:00:18] and he closed the book and he gave it
[1:00:19] again into the minister and sat down
[1:00:22] and the eyes of what's that word again
[1:00:26] all the eyes of all
[1:00:30] them that were in the synagogue were
[1:00:32] fastened on him
[1:00:34] and he began to say unto them this
[1:00:37] day this scripture that i just read
[1:00:44] is fulfilled in your ears
[1:00:48] and all bear him witness and wondered at
[1:00:51] the gracious words which proceeded out
[1:00:53] of his mouth
[1:00:54] and they said is not this joseph's son
[1:00:58] you know what the answer is no
[1:01:03] it was not joseph's son
[1:01:06] it was god's son it was joseph's
[1:01:09] step-son
[1:01:13] and he said unto them you will surely
[1:01:16] say
[1:01:17] unto me this proverb physician heal
[1:01:20] thyself
[1:01:21] whatsoever we have heard done in
[1:01:23] capernaum do also
[1:01:24] here in our country in other words show
[1:01:27] us a miracle
[1:01:28] show us a sign we we've heard all about
[1:01:32] what you've done
[1:01:33] do it here and he said verily
[1:01:39] i say unto you no prophet is accepted
[1:01:43] in his own country now maybe some of you
[1:01:45] that are new
[1:01:46] you wonder well this message is so true
[1:01:49] and it's come from god
[1:01:50] how come so few people i mean how come
[1:01:54] you know there's there's millions of
[1:01:56] people in the baptists and millions of
[1:01:58] peop
[1:01:58] billions in the catholic church and and
[1:02:01] you've got hindus and buddhists and
[1:02:03] sikhs and jains and every kind of
[1:02:05] denomination
[1:02:06] but how come only .001
[1:02:11] of the people in the world have received
[1:02:13] god's message
[1:02:15] for this day and jesus said
[1:02:19] no prophet is accepted
[1:02:22] in his own country you know that's the
[1:02:25] greatest indictment against
[1:02:27] our country that is going to bring
[1:02:29] divine judgment
[1:02:31] is number one we have rejected god's
[1:02:34] prophet
[1:02:35] number one number two the tens of
[1:02:38] millions of unborn children
[1:02:41] that have been killed and number three
[1:02:44] we have allowed america to become a
[1:02:46] modern sodom and gomorrah
[1:02:49] those three elements and i believe the
[1:02:52] last four years because america was good
[1:02:54] to
[1:02:55] israel i believe bought us just a few
[1:02:58] years of grace
[1:02:59] but but i believe you need to buckle
[1:03:02] your seat belt friends
[1:03:04] because things are coming fast and heavy
[1:03:07] and persecution is going to come fast
[1:03:09] and heavy
[1:03:10] and if you are not on the side of the
[1:03:12] ones that are in power
[1:03:14] you are going to become the enemy and
[1:03:17] they're going to search you out they're
[1:03:19] going to want to find out
[1:03:20] who what when where and why they'll get
[1:03:23] one of these big tech companies
[1:03:25] and they'll track you all the way back
[1:03:26] from kindergarten
[1:03:28] all the way up through grade school high
[1:03:30] school they'll track every email you've
[1:03:32] ever written
[1:03:33] they'll track every post that you've
[1:03:35] ever made they'll track your work record
[1:03:38] they'll track your credit score they
[1:03:40] will track everything about you and
[1:03:42] believe me
[1:03:42] if they want to do you harm they will do
[1:03:45] you harm
[1:03:46] now remember the devil brother jason i
[1:03:49] were talking about it last night
[1:03:51] the devil is so angry because
[1:03:54] he's got the whole world the whole world
[1:03:57] is deceived the whole world
[1:03:59] is on automatic pilot cruise control
[1:04:03] and they're just over there worshiping
[1:04:05] the god that they think is god
[1:04:07] and they're ignorantly worshipping satan
[1:04:10] he is the god of this evil
[1:04:12] age this is satan's eden this is jezebel
[1:04:15] religion
[1:04:16] and many people are doing god a service
[1:04:18] without it being his will
[1:04:20] because god's will is his word
[1:04:26] in verse 25 but i tell you the truth
[1:04:29] many widows
[1:04:30] were in israel in the days of elias
[1:04:34] when the heaven was shut up three years
[1:04:37] and six months
[1:04:38] and great famine was throughout the land
[1:04:41] but unto none of them was
[1:04:45] elias sent save unto serepta
[1:04:48] a city of sodom unto a woman
[1:04:52] that was a widow so think about that
[1:04:55] all the suffering that was going on
[1:04:58] all the starvation and god
[1:05:01] sent elijah to a widow
[1:05:05] woman and her little boy
[1:05:09] so now let's turn over to matthew 27.
[1:05:13] so jesus you know his ministry continues
[1:05:16] and
[1:05:17] and and the bible tells us if all the
[1:05:19] things that jesus said and done
[1:05:22] if they were all written all the books
[1:05:24] of the world would not be able to hold
[1:05:26] them now
[1:05:27] back in those days they didn't have
[1:05:28] libraries like we had but
[1:05:30] you know jesus was busy all day every
[1:05:33] day except when he was resting
[1:05:35] and and everywhere he went the bible
[1:05:37] said he healed them all
[1:05:38] he healed them all he healed them all he
[1:05:40] healed them all
[1:05:44] so the bible you know people say well
[1:05:46] brother branham you know he
[1:05:47] he may he he did this he did that you
[1:05:50] know
[1:05:50] when we read isaiah or jeremiah or ezra
[1:05:53] or nehemiah
[1:05:55] we read a little tiny cliff note a
[1:05:58] mind new cliff notes of their life
[1:06:01] we don't read their day-to-day life and
[1:06:03] their activities
[1:06:05] and the mistakes they made and the
[1:06:06] problems they had with their children
[1:06:08] and we don't read about all those things
[1:06:11] but in this day god
[1:06:12] chose to have the most transparent
[1:06:15] prophet
[1:06:16] in the world humanity and yet
[1:06:19] god overlaid that humanity
[1:06:22] you know the day the day that i really
[1:06:25] the day that god
[1:06:26] locked me into this message i'll never
[1:06:29] forget it i know the very hour of the
[1:06:31] very day
[1:06:32] and and brother arne brother jason knows
[1:06:35] brother arnie's
[1:06:36] sister uh uh debbie knows brother arnie
[1:06:39] and uh when i met brother arne he'd only
[1:06:41] been uh familiar with the message for
[1:06:43] about a year
[1:06:44] there was no churches and he was
[1:06:46] unsanctified to say the least
[1:06:48] but he put books in my hand and and i'm
[1:06:51] reading these books
[1:06:52] i'm reading these books i'll never
[1:06:54] forget brother jason arne you know i'm
[1:06:56] reading the church age book and i mean
[1:06:57] i'm in my glory i'm just a church age
[1:07:00] this is it this is the mother lode right
[1:07:02] here
[1:07:03] and brother arnie's saying he's saying
[1:07:05] get no seals yet
[1:07:07] i said what did you get no seals yet
[1:07:10] what he was saying was
[1:07:11] did you get in those seals yet and he
[1:07:14] would say it
[1:07:14] over and over i i don't know what a seal
[1:07:17] is
[1:07:18] a seal is a car you know something in
[1:07:20] the motor and he kept saying
[1:07:22] get in those seals get in those seals i
[1:07:24] didn't even have a sealed book
[1:07:26] i didn't even know where to go i didn't
[1:07:28] know there was one
[1:07:29] so one day as i'm struggling i'm
[1:07:32] struggling because you know i had
[1:07:33] catholic background baptist
[1:07:35] uh i i'd been to the full gospel
[1:07:38] businessmen heavily involved
[1:07:40] went to bible school and then to the upc
[1:07:43] and so i thought i knew a little bit
[1:07:44] about the bible so now i'm standing
[1:07:46] i'm struggling i'm struggling and things
[1:07:49] are coming
[1:07:49] clear and clear but that serpent seed
[1:07:52] that was the thing
[1:07:53] that all of us at one time probably
[1:07:56] if if i know if i know mostly you
[1:07:59] struggle with that
[1:08:00] and so here i am i'm struggling i'm
[1:08:02] struggling with the serpent seed
[1:08:03] and i'm struggling of whether i said if
[1:08:06] this man is a prophet and he said that's
[1:08:08] what happened
[1:08:08] that's what happened and i'm reading
[1:08:12] and i come to a part brother branham
[1:08:15] he's having a discernment line he said
[1:08:16] now sister
[1:08:18] i don't know you and you don't know me
[1:08:22] but there is one here who does know you
[1:08:24] and he does know me
[1:08:26] he said now when he and his spirit
[1:08:30] comes in me
[1:08:33] and my spirit goes away and
[1:08:38] he gives me a temporarily
[1:08:42] resurrection by my spirit
[1:08:47] and he wants to use my body
[1:08:51] and i'm so happy to loan it to him
[1:08:54] anything he can get out of it and when i
[1:08:58] heard that i understood brother jason
[1:09:01] a son of man revealing the
[1:09:04] son of man and after that you know i was
[1:09:07] bazooka proof
[1:09:08] you could you you couldn't shake me from
[1:09:11] this message
[1:09:12] you could have put a gun to my head you
[1:09:14] could have you could have put me on the
[1:09:15] rack
[1:09:16] but i knew this was true i knew god had
[1:09:19] sent the prophet
[1:09:22] now in chapter 27 of matthew verse 1
[1:09:27] when the morning was come
[1:09:31] all al is that word all again
[1:09:34] whole bunch of them all the chief
[1:09:37] priests
[1:09:38] and elders of the people took
[1:09:41] counsel with jesus
[1:09:44] against jesus to put him to death
[1:09:48] so this is the sanhedrin council the
[1:09:51] supreme court
[1:09:52] the chief priests the elders anybody who
[1:09:55] was anybody was in this meeting
[1:09:57] and they said we got a problem look at
[1:10:00] these people that are following this guy
[1:10:03] we don't know where this guy come from
[1:10:05] and and you know
[1:10:06] it's like it's like we've had a we've
[1:10:08] had an infestation
[1:10:10] it's like it's like we've had an
[1:10:11] infestation of termites
[1:10:13] and and and they're standing against
[1:10:16] everything that we know
[1:10:17] is true and holy we stand for what moses
[1:10:21] and
[1:10:21] abraham and we stand for that and
[1:10:24] somehow we have got to get rid
[1:10:28] of this man and his followers
[1:10:38] so now we see judas betrays him then he
[1:10:41] comes back
[1:10:42] throws the money down they won't take it
[1:10:44] back he goes and hangs himself
[1:10:47] then uh pilate tries to you know well
[1:10:50] i've got barabbas here and i got jesus
[1:10:52] here
[1:10:53] i'm gonna release one which one do you
[1:10:55] want they said give us barabbas
[1:10:58] well what shall we do with jesus crucify
[1:11:01] him
[1:11:03] and pilate goes over and he gets a bowl
[1:11:06] of water
[1:11:07] he said i'm washing my hands of the
[1:11:09] blood
[1:11:10] of this innocent man and they cried out
[1:11:14] let his blood be on us
[1:11:17] and our children what a prophecy
[1:11:21] brother jason when they said that
[1:11:24] let his blood be on
[1:11:27] us and our children
[1:11:31] so now in verse
[1:11:34] 26 then release he barabbas
[1:11:38] unto them and when he had scourged
[1:11:41] jesus so the first thing jesus got was
[1:11:44] the whipping
[1:11:45] he got 39 lashes
[1:11:48] from these monster torturous roman
[1:11:51] soldiers
[1:11:52] who loved you on what they were doing
[1:11:55] they were saddest
[1:11:56] say this saddest however you say it and
[1:11:59] they had these roman
[1:12:00] lictors these roman whips and they would
[1:12:03] take those things
[1:12:04] and they had these these leather straps
[1:12:07] and lead balls sewn into them
[1:12:09] and sharp like glass or metal pieces
[1:12:12] coming out
[1:12:13] and when they would take that whip and
[1:12:15] they'd
[1:12:17] and that whip would hit the flesh and
[1:12:19] the flesh would be
[1:12:21] ripped and the flesh would come out
[1:12:24] i couldn't even imagine getting one not
[1:12:27] one
[1:12:28] but jesus got 39 lashes
[1:12:32] before before they started the torture
[1:12:36] that was just the amateur torture that
[1:12:39] they were going to do
[1:12:46] then the soldiers of the governor took
[1:12:50] jesus into the common hall and
[1:12:53] gathered unto him the whole
[1:12:57] band of soldiers so
[1:13:00] it wasn't just a couple of soldiers that
[1:13:02] are in there
[1:13:04] that were abusing jesus it was the whole
[1:13:08] ban i don't know what the whole ban was
[1:13:10] but i'm sure
[1:13:11] it was a lot and their mission was
[1:13:15] to make an example out of this man
[1:13:18] to make an example that nobody ever be
[1:13:21] able to rise up
[1:13:22] against the authority of caesar and the
[1:13:25] jews
[1:13:26] they wanted them done away because he
[1:13:28] was ruining
[1:13:29] he was ruining the the art the hierarchy
[1:13:32] of their kingdom and so these soldiers
[1:13:35] were
[1:13:35] bent on a mission already demon
[1:13:38] possessed
[1:13:39] and now they have got one and they've
[1:13:41] been given permission
[1:13:43] do it do it as hard as you can
[1:13:47] make of him the the greatest example
[1:13:50] the world has ever seen
[1:13:56] and they stripped him and put on him a
[1:14:00] scarlet robe
[1:14:02] and when they had planted a crown of
[1:14:05] thorns they put it upon his head
[1:14:09] and a reed in his right hand and now
[1:14:11] they began to mock him
[1:14:14] sarcasm they bowed the knee before him
[1:14:18] and they mocked him saying
[1:14:19] hail king of the jews
[1:14:24] and they spit upon him and took the reed
[1:14:27] and they smote him on the head so they
[1:14:30] began to beat him
[1:14:32] they already whipped them stripped them
[1:14:35] punched them now they spit upon them
[1:14:40] smote him on the head and after
[1:14:44] they had mocked him they took the robe
[1:14:47] off from him and put on his own raiment
[1:14:49] on him
[1:14:49] and led him away to crucify
[1:14:54] now these roman soldiers they were
[1:14:57] masters of torture
[1:14:59] crucifixion it was the most horrible
[1:15:02] death in the roman empire it was
[1:15:06] the the epitome of capital punishment
[1:15:11] and when those roman soldiers they did
[1:15:13] it all the time
[1:15:14] and no doubt they had thieves and
[1:15:16] robbers and murderers
[1:15:18] and when it was time for them to be
[1:15:19] crucified they had to be dragged up the
[1:15:22] hill
[1:15:22] sometimes took multiple soldiers to drag
[1:15:25] that guy up the hill
[1:15:26] and no doubt the demons in them are
[1:15:28] screaming and the guys crying out
[1:15:30] and screaming and cursing and asking for
[1:15:33] mercy
[1:15:33] and maybe they had to have a couple of
[1:15:35] soldiers hold his hand down to nail it
[1:15:37] and a couple of soul i'm talking about
[1:15:39] the regular
[1:15:40] people not jesus and maybe they had to
[1:15:42] hold another hand down
[1:15:44] as they're screaming and cursing and
[1:15:45] moving and doing everything they can
[1:15:48] because they know they're gonna die and
[1:15:50] finally they they get them fastened and
[1:15:52] they get them nailed
[1:15:54] and up they go and have you ever seen
[1:15:56] pictures of rome
[1:15:57] sometime there were time where there
[1:15:59] were hundreds
[1:16:01] of crucified people hanging on the cross
[1:16:06] but this one was different this one was
[1:16:10] jesus this is the one that claimed to be
[1:16:14] the son of god
[1:16:15] this is the one who claimed that he
[1:16:18] could take this temple
[1:16:19] and and and build it in three days
[1:16:23] he had done the miracles he had done the
[1:16:25] sign many of the people
[1:16:26] had been in the media maybe they ate the
[1:16:28] bread maybe they ate the fishes
[1:16:30] maybe they saw the blind man maybe they
[1:16:32] saw the deaf men
[1:16:34] maybe they saw the lepers because at
[1:16:36] that time you know
[1:16:37] the area where jesus circulated it was a
[1:16:40] small
[1:16:40] area and and that network that that
[1:16:43] gossip network it was going
[1:16:45] everywhere and now everybody knew
[1:16:48] that the romans and the jews had
[1:16:51] conspired
[1:16:52] and jesus was going to be crucified and
[1:16:55] the crowds
[1:16:56] came and they lined the route where they
[1:16:59] knew he was going to come
[1:17:00] and he had the drag that after all that
[1:17:03] beating and whipping he had to drag the
[1:17:05] cross
[1:17:06] then they got simon of cyrene to carry
[1:17:08] it
[1:17:09] then when jesus when they got him to the
[1:17:12] top
[1:17:12] of the hill jesus looked down at the
[1:17:15] cross
[1:17:17] and they remember all the screaming and
[1:17:19] the kicking and the cursing
[1:17:21] that went on when somebody's going to be
[1:17:23] crucified and maybe those roman soldiers
[1:17:26] laughed at it and the more they screamed
[1:17:28] probably the better they liked it
[1:17:30] because they knew
[1:17:31] they had they were going to win in the
[1:17:33] end that guy was going to get crucified
[1:17:35] no matter how hard he kicked or punched
[1:17:38] or pulled or swore he was going down
[1:17:41] and here comes jesus and jesus comes
[1:17:45] and he sees the cross
[1:17:49] and he lays down and he stretches out
[1:17:52] his hands
[1:17:54] and he waits for the nails
[1:17:58] they had never seen one
[1:18:01] like jesus come they had never seen
[1:18:04] a lamb go to the slaughter
[1:18:08] without a sound that was shocking
[1:18:11] to them now if we go back to leviticus
[1:18:15] we go back to the fine flower
[1:18:19] had to be ground every piece was the
[1:18:21] same
[1:18:22] and then the oil the frankincense
[1:18:26] no leaven no honey and salt
[1:18:30] so now you know leviticus is pointing
[1:18:33] forward
[1:18:34] and the widow woman she fulfilled part
[1:18:37] of that
[1:18:38] because she had the meal and she had the
[1:18:41] oil
[1:18:41] and she had the two sticks
[1:18:45] now jesus comes he is the bread of life
[1:18:48] that comes down from heaven and he's
[1:18:51] anointed with the oil of the holy ghost
[1:18:55] and in this sacrifice there was no
[1:18:59] leaven
[1:19:00] amen and jesus was not a honey christian
[1:19:04] he was not one of these well praise the
[1:19:06] lord brother hallelujah how's everything
[1:19:08] going you know i'm doing fine you know
[1:19:10] things are going good you know and
[1:19:12] no he was a real son of god he's a real
[1:19:16] man
[1:19:18] went he knew he was born for this
[1:19:21] purpose
[1:19:22] you know what i read first one the first
[1:19:23] time i read
[1:19:25] and uh you know the depth of
[1:19:27] predestination
[1:19:28] brother jason gave me uh the advice to
[1:19:31] read that book the sovereignty of god by
[1:19:34] arthur pink
[1:19:35] and and then i'm reading in brother
[1:19:37] branham he says
[1:19:38] now god being a savior
[1:19:43] it was necessary that he
[1:19:46] predestinate a race of people
[1:19:49] who would fall in order to give
[1:19:53] himself a reason and a purpose
[1:19:56] for being well what was god's purpose
[1:19:59] what was his reason for being
[1:20:01] it was to become a savior and so
[1:20:04] here at the cross there was the bread of
[1:20:07] life
[1:20:08] anointed with the holy ghost no
[1:20:11] leaven no honey and there was salt there
[1:20:15] and the salt was to preserve jesus
[1:20:18] christ
[1:20:19] in the end he said father you know why
[1:20:22] has thou forsaken
[1:20:24] me but he stayed and he bore the
[1:20:27] the cross he knew why he was there
[1:20:30] he knew what it was going to purchase he
[1:20:33] knew it was going to cover
[1:20:34] every sin that had been committed by all
[1:20:37] the old testament saints
[1:20:39] he knew it was going to cover every sin
[1:20:42] that would be committed by all the
[1:20:44] people that would come
[1:20:46] after his death and so he went there
[1:20:49] as a lamb now remember in the beginning
[1:20:51] in leviticus we talked about
[1:20:53] you know that the the it could be cooked
[1:20:56] in the oven and it could be cooked in
[1:20:59] the pan
[1:21:01] or it could be cooked in the frying pan
[1:21:04] well during jesus life
[1:21:05] you know a pan and a frying pan is
[1:21:08] totally different than an oven
[1:21:10] in an oven you know heat is applied
[1:21:13] maybe you're baking a cake or baking
[1:21:14] some bread
[1:21:15] and gradually you know the heat begins
[1:21:18] to expand
[1:21:19] well when jesus was on the earth he was
[1:21:22] carrying all these burdens with inside
[1:21:24] of him
[1:21:25] nobody really knew and so all these
[1:21:28] burdens
[1:21:29] they were in the oven but then when they
[1:21:32] came
[1:21:32] after him and they grabbed them in
[1:21:34] gethsemane and they began to push him
[1:21:36] around
[1:21:37] and they began to beat him and they and
[1:21:39] and they whipped them
[1:21:40] now it's like he's in the pan now
[1:21:43] everybody's can see the effects
[1:21:45] of what's happening to this meal
[1:21:47] offering he's being whipped
[1:21:49] and the blood is coming everywhere but
[1:21:52] then when he got on the cross
[1:21:54] when he got on that cross now he was
[1:21:57] naked they say he had a cloth around him
[1:21:59] no
[1:22:00] he was naked they were making a mockery
[1:22:03] of him an example of him
[1:22:05] the bible said his visage was marred
[1:22:08] more than
[1:22:08] any you could not even recognize who he
[1:22:11] was by the time
[1:22:13] he got to the cross he looked like a
[1:22:15] piece of meat
[1:22:16] a piece of red meat that was on that
[1:22:19] cross
[1:22:23] and then we read down
[1:22:26] a little bit further
[1:22:33] in verse 34 and they crucified him
[1:22:37] and parted his garments casting lots
[1:22:41] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:22:42] spoken by the prophet
[1:22:44] they parted my garments among them and
[1:22:47] upon my vesture
[1:22:48] they shall cast lots and sitting down
[1:22:51] and watched him there
[1:22:53] i don't know how many was there brother
[1:22:55] jason i imagine
[1:22:57] hundreds maybe thousands
[1:23:00] were surrounding the area there looking
[1:23:02] at what was going to happen
[1:23:04] the miracle the miracle worker and now
[1:23:07] the one well
[1:23:08] is he going to do one more miracle is he
[1:23:10] going to escape
[1:23:11] from the jews is he going to escape from
[1:23:14] rome
[1:23:14] if he does we want to be an eyewitness
[1:23:16] because we've seen the other miracles
[1:23:18] before
[1:23:18] and they were real and we we can hardly
[1:23:21] believe
[1:23:22] that this is going to be the end of this
[1:23:25] great miracle worker
[1:23:26] think of his followers think of the
[1:23:28] apostles
[1:23:29] think of his mother think of mary
[1:23:32] magdalene
[1:23:33] martha and mary all the ones that loved
[1:23:36] him and
[1:23:37] followed him and they're saying this
[1:23:40] this can't be happening
[1:23:42] how is this how is this even possible
[1:23:49] and now we see that there's two thieves
[1:23:52] on the cross now i've talked to some
[1:23:55] people and they say well there was a
[1:23:56] good thief
[1:23:57] and a bad thief no
[1:24:01] they were both thieves and by the law
[1:24:04] they were getting what the law
[1:24:06] required to be crucified and there they
[1:24:09] are they're being crucified one on the
[1:24:11] right and one on the left
[1:24:13] and all the people down below the chief
[1:24:15] priests and the elders
[1:24:16] they're mocking and cursing and swearing
[1:24:19] and the ones that are on the cross
[1:24:21] they're doing the same thing
[1:24:23] the bible said they were casting it in
[1:24:26] jesus teeth
[1:24:27] [Music]
[1:24:29] but then something happened
[1:24:33] the thief on the right i believe
[1:24:36] that he was the first one to ever
[1:24:39] experience the third pull
[1:24:43] because he never heard a message he
[1:24:45] never saw a miracle
[1:24:47] but something happened to him and he
[1:24:50] went from cursing
[1:24:51] he went from swearing and casting in his
[1:24:54] teeth to saying
[1:24:55] saying lord remember me
[1:25:00] he's just a few minutes from death
[1:25:02] friends remember me
[1:25:04] when you come into your kingdom and
[1:25:06] jesus in his agony
[1:25:08] he said this day you will be
[1:25:12] with me in paradise
[1:25:15] and we wonder we wonder who we wonder
[1:25:18] who can be saved
[1:25:20] we wonder how far down the road they've
[1:25:22] gone and yet they're the
[1:25:23] they're beyond redemption
[1:25:32] so now in the in the same chapter
[1:25:35] coming down to the end now in verse 45
[1:25:39] now from the sixth hour there was
[1:25:41] darkness over
[1:25:42] all the land unto the ninth hour so for
[1:25:45] three hours
[1:25:47] jesus was on the cross and it got real
[1:25:51] real dark
[1:25:54] in about the ninth hour jesus cried with
[1:25:58] a loud voice saying eli eli
[1:26:01] lama sabachthani that is to say my god
[1:26:04] my god
[1:26:05] why hast thou forsaken me
[1:26:08] and some of them that stood there when
[1:26:09] they heard this said this man calleth
[1:26:11] for elias
[1:26:12] and straight away one of them ran and
[1:26:14] took the sponge and filled it
[1:26:16] with vinegar and put it on a reed and
[1:26:18] gave him the drink the rest said let's
[1:26:20] see
[1:26:20] let us see whether elias will come to
[1:26:23] save him
[1:26:23] and jesus when he cried again with a
[1:26:26] loud voice
[1:26:27] yielded up the ghost
[1:26:30] jesus gave his life
[1:26:34] you can't kill god if jesus wanted to he
[1:26:37] could have stayed on that cross
[1:26:39] all day or for a week or for a month
[1:26:42] or for a year they couldn't kill god you
[1:26:44] can't kill god
[1:26:46] but jesus yielded up the
[1:26:49] he yielded up his spirit
[1:26:53] he cried father it is finished
[1:26:56] and here's what happened and behold the
[1:26:59] veil of the temple was
[1:27:00] rent and twain from the top to the
[1:27:02] bottom and the earth
[1:27:04] did quake big earthquake
[1:27:08] right at the time of the crucifixion of
[1:27:11] the meal offering
[1:27:17] and the rocks rent
[1:27:22] and the graves were opened you're not
[1:27:25] going to hear this preached in any
[1:27:26] denominational church friends
[1:27:30] and the graves were open and many bodies
[1:27:33] of the saints
[1:27:34] which slept arose and came out of the
[1:27:37] graves
[1:27:38] after his resurrection and went into
[1:27:41] this
[1:27:42] the holy city and appeared unto
[1:27:45] many now i've asked theologians i said
[1:27:49] what happened here after the
[1:27:51] resurrection who are these ones that
[1:27:53] came up
[1:27:54] and how did they go into the holy city
[1:27:57] how did they travel around how did they
[1:27:59] appear to many people
[1:28:01] you won't hear that outside of the
[1:28:03] message
[1:28:04] but brother branham said because he saw
[1:28:06] it in a vision he said well abraham and
[1:28:08] sarah
[1:28:09] walked up to jesus and said would it be
[1:28:11] okay
[1:28:12] if we kind of took a whistle-stop tour
[1:28:14] around jerusalem
[1:28:16] and see how things have changed since
[1:28:18] we've been here
[1:28:19] and sure you just go ahead and they
[1:28:22] could appear
[1:28:23] and they could disappear just like jesus
[1:28:26] could
[1:28:29] so now leviticus meal
[1:28:32] oil no leaven no honey
[1:28:36] salt as a preservative either in the
[1:28:38] oven
[1:28:39] or the pan or the frying pan but there's
[1:28:42] one
[1:28:43] ingredient that we just left out and
[1:28:46] that was the ingredients of frankincense
[1:28:49] and remember the secret of frankincense
[1:28:52] is it's
[1:28:52] only released when heat is applied
[1:28:56] to it and there on the cross jesus
[1:28:59] is in the frying pan there in the
[1:29:02] hottest most
[1:29:03] torturous moments of his life this
[1:29:05] frankincense is
[1:29:07] released he said father forgive them
[1:29:10] they don't know what they're doing
[1:29:14] you imagine the lamb of god
[1:29:18] and remember it started with leviticus
[1:29:21] picked up with the little widow woman
[1:29:23] this is a supernatural book it's a
[1:29:25] mystical book
[1:29:26] revelation is a supernatural
[1:29:28] multiplication of inspiration
[1:29:30] and revelation for communication with
[1:29:33] god the bible said those who diligently
[1:29:35] search after me they will find me and
[1:29:38] you'll find him in every book of the
[1:29:40] bible
[1:29:41] you find him in type you find him in
[1:29:43] shadow you find him in
[1:29:45] in punishment you find him in grace you
[1:29:47] find him in love
[1:29:48] you find him all different way you find
[1:29:51] him in david and all david's false and
[1:29:53] how we come back you'll find him in
[1:29:54] solomon and all his glory
[1:29:56] and then how he fell and come back you
[1:29:59] find him in samson
[1:30:00] you find him in all the great men of god
[1:30:03] you find him in
[1:30:04] in saul who became paul you find him in
[1:30:07] peter who denied the lord three times
[1:30:09] and cursed while he did
[1:30:11] so you find him in all the bible it's
[1:30:14] grace redemption love
[1:30:24] so now let's talk about you and me
[1:30:29] in romans 12 paul says i beseech thee by
[1:30:32] the mercies of god
[1:30:34] that you present your body
[1:30:38] a living sacrifice holy
[1:30:41] acceptable unto god which is your
[1:30:45] reasonable service now reasonable
[1:30:49] service that means
[1:30:50] that's the minimum that's the minimum
[1:30:52] you should do
[1:30:53] is to present your body in other words
[1:30:57] lord here i am here's my body
[1:31:00] in other words right here this here this
[1:31:02] this flesh here
[1:31:03] this is our meal this is that fine
[1:31:07] flour that leviticus is talking about
[1:31:10] and then
[1:31:11] this meal it's got to be ground down
[1:31:14] the burr has got to take it until it's
[1:31:16] jesus christ the same
[1:31:18] yesterday today and forever
[1:31:22] and the oil of the holy ghost has got to
[1:31:24] come
[1:31:25] and it's got to overlay this flesh
[1:31:28] so now you've got the meal and the
[1:31:32] oil then you got to get rid of the
[1:31:36] leaven
[1:31:36] get rid of the world get rid of anything
[1:31:40] that god if god was standing next to you
[1:31:43] anything that you would do that god
[1:31:46] would not accept
[1:31:47] get rid of it don't if it's gray area
[1:31:50] get rid of it you want everything to be
[1:31:53] right
[1:31:54] and holy and true you know first thing
[1:31:56] in the morning when i wake up there's
[1:31:58] got to be two deaths
[1:31:59] i gotta die and the devil's gonna die
[1:32:02] first thing in the morning
[1:32:04] bind that yapping dog don't even let
[1:32:06] them get started
[1:32:08] don't even let them put you on the
[1:32:09] stress express and get up late and hit
[1:32:12] the snooze button over and over and over
[1:32:14] and you're running around putting your
[1:32:15] clothes on
[1:32:16] getting in the car and speeding down the
[1:32:18] road and one of these nice
[1:32:20] beaufort police officers wants to visit
[1:32:23] with you
[1:32:23] and he wants to give you a little note
[1:32:26] i know i'm in beaufort when i see those
[1:32:29] lights brother jason
[1:32:31] and i slow down when i come to beaufort
[1:32:33] i slow down
[1:32:36] see and so your meal your flesh
[1:32:40] presented as a living sacrifice
[1:32:43] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[1:32:46] reasonable service
[1:32:47] now the holy ghost has got to come down
[1:32:49] and the holy ghost has got to fill up
[1:32:52] every particle of your life every
[1:32:55] fabric fabric that that you are made of
[1:32:58] needs to be anointed
[1:33:00] and fulfilled with the word of god and
[1:33:03] the presence of god and the love of god
[1:33:06] in your heart no leaven
[1:33:09] what's the other one get rid of that
[1:33:12] silly christianity
[1:33:13] oh praise the lord brother you know
[1:33:15] glory to god hallelujah
[1:33:16] yeah everything's good you know yeah
[1:33:18] yeah yeah yeah
[1:33:20] you know you know how brother breath
[1:33:21] brother branham said now you know
[1:33:23] he said no everybody's a blessing
[1:33:28] someone they come and someone they go
[1:33:33] he said it right out he said now
[1:33:35] everybody creates atmosphere
[1:33:37] he said now some people they create an
[1:33:40] atmosphere
[1:33:41] and you just love to be in that
[1:33:43] atmosphere
[1:33:44] i look forward to coming and being with
[1:33:46] brother jason and his family
[1:33:48] i love i used to love coming in in the
[1:33:51] presence of brother eddie watkins and
[1:33:53] gene
[1:33:53] and their family it was such a welcoming
[1:33:56] warm it was like a warm
[1:33:58] blanket just just dropped on you and you
[1:34:00] just felt
[1:34:01] just exactly right but i've been around
[1:34:04] other people boy when they come around
[1:34:06] you
[1:34:07] it's gossip complaining cynicism
[1:34:10] skepticism sarcasm
[1:34:12] anger fear all those things and they're
[1:34:15] manifesting it right in front of you
[1:34:17] because
[1:34:17] every one of us we are a supernatural
[1:34:20] being
[1:34:21] and when i come in contact with somebody
[1:34:23] if they're not a believer
[1:34:24] they're still a spiritual being they
[1:34:27] might be anointed with the unholy spirit
[1:34:29] but they're a spiritual being
[1:34:30] i'm a supernatural being and if my
[1:34:33] spirit and their spirit
[1:34:34] if it clashes then i see you
[1:34:38] wouldn't want to be you and and down the
[1:34:41] road you go
[1:34:45] and then there has to be salt
[1:34:48] because the salt is the preservative
[1:34:51] spoken about
[1:34:53] in leviticus now in this day
[1:34:57] do we have ahab and jezebel on the scene
[1:35:01] in this day like no other day
[1:35:04] i think everybody can agree with that
[1:35:08] because of who they are and what they're
[1:35:10] doing
[1:35:11] is there a famine in the land
[1:35:15] for the hearing of the true word of god
[1:35:18] yes and elijah called that famine
[1:35:22] in 1957 he said if america doesn't
[1:35:25] accept it this year
[1:35:26] she's finished finished
[1:35:31] one coming here one coming there you
[1:35:33] know a little speck here a little speck
[1:35:35] a little
[1:35:36] we're looking for them all the time but
[1:35:38] they become fewer
[1:35:39] and fewer in between
[1:35:43] so elijah's come he's called for a
[1:35:46] famine
[1:35:49] and then there's a little widow woman
[1:35:52] in the land a little widow woman
[1:35:57] like me like you with all my religious
[1:36:01] training and all the religious leaven i
[1:36:04] had inside of me
[1:36:05] still i was like a spiritual skeleton
[1:36:09] walking down the road i had no idea
[1:36:12] about
[1:36:12] church ages and seals and predestination
[1:36:15] and adoption
[1:36:16] and election and beyond the curtain of
[1:36:18] time and i could name a hundred other
[1:36:20] things that i didn't know
[1:36:21] so here i am a skeleton walking down the
[1:36:24] road
[1:36:25] and i come across elijah and elijah he
[1:36:28] begins to pack those pounds
[1:36:29] pack those pounds on me the more that i
[1:36:32] read the more that i listened the more
[1:36:33] that i talked you know and the muscle
[1:36:35] started getting greater
[1:36:36] and the mind started getting sharper and
[1:36:39] that super sense that sixth sense
[1:36:42] it began to be focused and now i i would
[1:36:45] say
[1:36:45] it is every once in a while i'll miss
[1:36:48] some or i meet somebody
[1:36:49] and i'll say uh i don't know about that
[1:36:52] guy but usually it's
[1:36:54] right on point you know that that super
[1:36:56] sense that discernment
[1:37:04] now what's the next thing that has to
[1:37:06] happen
[1:37:09] you're going to go through trials maybe
[1:37:12] maybe even right now maybe you're going
[1:37:14] through some trials
[1:37:15] like jesus but they're in the oven
[1:37:19] nobody but you knows about it and you're
[1:37:22] carrying around that burden and and it's
[1:37:25] just like an
[1:37:26] oven experience it's a burden it's a of
[1:37:28] an experience
[1:37:30] or maybe maybe a little later you know
[1:37:32] it comes out in the open and maybe a few
[1:37:34] more people know about it
[1:37:36] and you talk to your pastor and talk to
[1:37:37] a few of your friends and people know
[1:37:39] oh you know what brother so-and-so is
[1:37:41] going through sister so and so
[1:37:43] and it becomes like a pan experience
[1:37:47] everybody's looking in the pan and when
[1:37:49] you when you come on the scene
[1:37:50] everybody's looking yeah oh poor brother
[1:37:53] so and so hell we need to pray for that
[1:37:54] brother
[1:37:55] you become an object people's eyes are
[1:37:58] fastened to you their mind is fastened
[1:38:00] to you
[1:38:01] they know a little bit about your trial
[1:38:04] but oh boy when that trial
[1:38:08] gets out of it gets off the rails so to
[1:38:11] speak
[1:38:11] maybe one of your children backslides or
[1:38:14] maybe you backslide
[1:38:15] or maybe one of your children plays a
[1:38:17] fool winds up in jail or wines
[1:38:20] all kinds of crazy things happen now
[1:38:23] that's a frying pan experience and now
[1:38:26] you're there in that pan
[1:38:27] and everybody knows about it it's bad
[1:38:34] and then
[1:38:37] like jesus on the frying pan experience
[1:38:43] you take your cross
[1:38:46] and you lay down and you become
[1:38:50] that living sacrifice holy
[1:38:53] acceptable unto god which is your
[1:38:57] reasonable
[1:38:58] service and remember
[1:39:02] on the cross in jesus
[1:39:05] hottest trial the frankincense kicked in
[1:39:11] the sweetest aroma was released
[1:39:15] from his greatest trial
[1:39:18] and how many of us have gone through
[1:39:20] things and say
[1:39:21] i would never want to go through that
[1:39:23] again but i'm so
[1:39:25] thankful i did go through it because i
[1:39:28] learned and i grew
[1:39:29] and i got closer to god and i realized
[1:39:32] that i
[1:39:32] am not in control that god is in control
[1:39:38] last scripture
[1:39:42] we're going to go to thessalonians
[1:39:50] 1st thessalonians 4.
[1:39:55] now remember all those
[1:39:59] ingredients the meal the oil
[1:40:03] no leaven no honey salt frankincense
[1:40:07] the women picks it up then jesus comes
[1:40:09] and he becomes
[1:40:11] the epitome of the living sacrifice
[1:40:14] and then here we are ahab jezebel
[1:40:18] is on the scene like never before
[1:40:21] brother jason i were talking about it
[1:40:23] you know to me it's like a neon
[1:40:25] strobe light what's going on it's time
[1:40:28] to buckle our seat belts like never
[1:40:30] before
[1:40:31] it's time to watch and wait and listen
[1:40:34] and be aware it's good you know when
[1:40:37] when the children of israel when they
[1:40:39] were getting ready for the passover
[1:40:41] they were ready they were ready to move
[1:40:44] at the call of moses
[1:40:51] last verse first thessalonians 4
[1:40:54] 13 but i would not have you to be
[1:40:57] ignorant brethren concerning them
[1:41:00] which are asleep that ye
[1:41:03] sorrow not even as others which have
[1:41:06] no hope you know friends
[1:41:09] i i've i've lost family and friends when
[1:41:12] i was a catholic i went to a lot of
[1:41:14] funerals when i was a catholic
[1:41:17] and i mean it's like i mean it's like
[1:41:19] mourning and sobbing and weeping and
[1:41:21] people falling all over the casket and
[1:41:24] wanting to climb in the casket
[1:41:26] i mean it's it's wild because all those
[1:41:28] people can think of
[1:41:29] my poor husband my poor wife my poor son
[1:41:32] my
[1:41:33] they're in purgatory now and they're
[1:41:35] suffering
[1:41:36] and they're burning no no catholic goes
[1:41:40] right
[1:41:40] the bible says to us to be absent from
[1:41:42] the body is to be present with the lord
[1:41:45] it's not them it's not they are we they
[1:41:48] are
[1:41:48] wailing weeping and wailing
[1:41:52] but paul says we don't sorrow
[1:41:55] as others which have no hope for
[1:41:59] if ye believe that jesus rose
[1:42:03] again even so them
[1:42:07] which sleep in jesus will god bring with
[1:42:10] him
[1:42:11] for this say we unto you by the word of
[1:42:13] the lord
[1:42:14] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:42:17] the coming of the lord
[1:42:18] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:42:21] for the lord himself
[1:42:22] shall descend
[1:42:26] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[1:42:28] of the archangel with the trump of god
[1:42:30] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:42:32] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:42:34] be caught up together with them in the
[1:42:36] clouds to meet the lord in the air
[1:42:38] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[1:42:40] wherefore
[1:42:41] comfort ye one another with these
[1:42:44] thoughts
[1:42:46] now my last thought my bible's closed my
[1:42:49] last thought
[1:42:50] is this rapture that we're all
[1:42:53] looking forward to expecting i've been
[1:42:57] expecting it for a long long time
[1:43:00] and perhaps if time goes on i won't i
[1:43:03] won't experience it but you young people
[1:43:06] you have got a lot better chance of
[1:43:08] receiving that rapture
[1:43:10] than i do or those of us who have some
[1:43:13] years upon them
[1:43:14] i'm hoping he comes soon but i know one
[1:43:16] thing
[1:43:17] that rapture is not going to come until
[1:43:20] the last seed comes in
[1:43:24] and comes to perfection
[1:43:28] think about that friends now they might
[1:43:30] not have all the messages read
[1:43:32] but their faith their faith will come to
[1:43:35] perfection
[1:43:36] and so what god is waiting for now is
[1:43:39] for the meal offering
[1:43:43] you me the bride around the world
[1:43:47] he's waiting for us to pick up our cross
[1:43:52] to become that living sacrifice
[1:43:56] holy acceptable unto god
[1:43:59] which is our reasonable service
[1:44:03] let's stand
[1:44:17] father we thank you for this day that
[1:44:20] you have given to us
[1:44:23] we thank you for this road map
[1:44:27] of your scripture that you have outlined
[1:44:31] you are the divine architect you do
[1:44:34] everything perfectly
[1:44:36] and a prophet of god says i have laid it
[1:44:39] out
[1:44:39] you brothers go in and dig it out by the
[1:44:42] grace of god once in a while
[1:44:44] we really hit the honeypot and for me
[1:44:47] this message
[1:44:49] has hit the honeypot like very few that
[1:44:52] i've ever seen
[1:44:53] to see it all the way from leviticus
[1:44:56] all the way to the day that you and i
[1:44:59] are living in
[1:45:00] and the manifestation of
[1:45:03] the events that are taking place all
[1:45:06] around the world
[1:45:07] and today like in the days of ahab and
[1:45:11] jezebel
[1:45:12] there is a super famine
[1:45:15] in the land for the hearing of the true
[1:45:19] word of god
[1:45:21] prophet of god said in 1954
[1:45:24] 64. if time goes on for 50 years the
[1:45:27] whole
[1:45:28] world will be in
[1:45:31] total insanity
[1:45:41] i didn't know if i was going to do this
[1:45:42] but i'm gonna take two minutes
[1:45:44] if you don't mind i always get a kick
[1:45:47] out of pastors when they say can i have
[1:45:49] five more minutes can i have ten more
[1:45:50] minutes
[1:45:51] i'm waiting for somebody to jump up and
[1:45:53] say no
[1:45:54] you've had enough but i'm just asking
[1:45:57] for
[1:45:58] a few more minutes not to break the
[1:46:00] sacredness of the atmosphere but
[1:46:02] as a result of everything that i've read
[1:46:06] and know one time i was flying on a
[1:46:08] plane
[1:46:09] and sometime these planes to india or
[1:46:12] africa or all over asia
[1:46:16] they're long flights and i had
[1:46:18] remembered brother branham
[1:46:20] had a track it was pick up your pen and
[1:46:23] write
[1:46:24] and so i said i'm just going to i'm
[1:46:25] going to think about all the things that
[1:46:27] i would not know
[1:46:29] if i was not in the message and so i
[1:46:31] began to write them down and i just want
[1:46:33] to share them with you
[1:46:34] i timed it it's going to take two
[1:46:36] minutes okay
[1:46:42] if it had not been for this message we
[1:46:44] would not know that it had never rained
[1:46:46] before noah
[1:46:47] we would not know that abraham and sarah
[1:46:49] would change back to a young man and a
[1:46:50] young woman
[1:46:51] we'd not know that king saul was saved
[1:46:53] or the rich young ruler's
[1:46:55] ultimate end was in hell we would not
[1:46:57] know that hell is not
[1:46:59] eternal we would not understand baptism
[1:47:01] godhead
[1:47:02] we would not understand the rapture the
[1:47:04] changing who the two witnesses
[1:47:06] were who the 144 000 are
[1:47:09] who the souls under the altar were we'd
[1:47:12] not understand church ages seals serpent
[1:47:15] seed
[1:47:15] we'd not be able to measure the future
[1:47:17] home of the heavenly bride
[1:47:21] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:47:24] bride excuse me
[1:47:25] we not understand the antichrist the
[1:47:27] false prophet the beast the
[1:47:29] the number the name the mark the image
[1:47:31] the harlot
[1:47:32] we not understand the seven dimensions
[1:47:36] that's a lot that's a lot that nobody
[1:47:38] would know
[1:47:39] you know this message is spoken in a
[1:47:41] language that it takes the token to
[1:47:43] understand it
[1:47:44] i call it supernatural linguistics
[1:47:49] we would not understand adoption
[1:47:51] predestination statue of a perfect man
[1:47:53] marriage and divorce anointed ones at
[1:47:56] the end time
[1:47:56] satan's eden the god of this evil age
[1:47:59] jezebel religion doing god a service
[1:48:01] without it being his will we wouldn't
[1:48:03] understand the third pull
[1:48:05] and so as a result of that who are we
[1:48:08] well
[1:48:08] we're new creatures in christ we're to
[1:48:10] be the happiest people on earth
[1:48:12] we're attributes of god thoughts of god

[1:51:09] one page
[1:51:11] it's what we have in christ
[1:51:15] we have the seed of perfect love and
[1:51:18] perfect faith in us
[1:51:21] the seed of supernatural strength and
[1:51:24] stamina
[1:51:26] you've received a divine blood
[1:51:28] transfusion
[1:51:29] a heart transplant a mind transplant
[1:51:33] literally a life transplant
[1:51:37] you have the ability to prosper and
[1:51:38] thrive in the realms of the supernatural
[1:51:41] you have supernatural marching orders
[1:51:45] you have a passion to know and serve god
[1:51:47] you have a magnificent
[1:51:49] obsession to know christ and finally
[1:51:54] you have a supernatural passport
[1:51:57] into the next realm let's bow our heads
[1:51:59] once more
[1:52:01] father i know this has been a little
[1:52:03] long and i pray that
[1:52:05] those that are here have identified
[1:52:08] who they are and and what their mission
[1:52:11] in life is and that is to have their
[1:52:13] hearts turned back
[1:52:14] to the faith of our fathers and like
[1:52:17] paul
[1:52:18] paul everything he went through lord and
[1:52:20] at the end he said
[1:52:22] this light affliction worketh for me a
[1:52:26] far
[1:52:27] greater reward in glory father you put
[1:52:30] saul
[1:52:31] uh paul through so many things but he
[1:52:34] knew
[1:52:35] who he was serving he knew he was tapped
[1:52:37] into the next realm
[1:52:39] and nothing they could do in this realm
[1:52:41] could separate him from
[1:52:43] from knowing who he was in you and i
[1:52:45] trust that will be the same revelation
[1:52:48] that some of my brothers and sisters
[1:52:50] will have today and finally
[1:52:51] before jason comes if you're here today
[1:52:55] and you would say my prayer from this
[1:52:58] day forward
[1:52:59] is i want to renew my commitment or make
[1:53:03] a commitment
[1:53:04] that i from this day onward am going to
[1:53:06] be
[1:53:07] that living sacrifice i'm going to take
[1:53:10] this meal
[1:53:11] i'm gonna let the holy ghost lead me i'm
[1:53:14] getting rid of all the leaven getting
[1:53:15] rid of all the honey
[1:53:17] and the salt that's gonna preserve me
[1:53:19] and i'm getting on my cross
[1:53:21] and i'm going to have the sweetest life
[1:53:24] the sweetest presents the sweetest words
[1:53:26] the sweetest motives the sweetest goals
[1:53:29] and ambitions come out of me
[1:53:31] than has ever been in my entire life if
[1:53:34] that's your prayer would you lift your
[1:53:35] hand and say lord
[1:53:37] help me and we can't do that alone
[1:53:39] friends
[1:53:40] we have to lay at the cross and he can
[1:53:43] do it for us
[1:53:44] he can do that transformation let's sing
[1:53:47] that song
[1:53:48] created me a clean heart i'll sing one
[1:53:50] verse and ask brother jason to come
[1:53:54] [Music]
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:10] [Music]
[1:54:19] create lord o create
[1:54:22] in me a clean heart
[1:54:27] we're going to lower that we're going to
[1:54:28] lower that down we're going to lower
[1:54:30] that it's going to be too hot
[1:54:38] amen hey matt matt let me make my
[1:54:41] comments first
[1:54:42] amen do you enjoy that today
[1:54:46] you know i i love a journey through the
[1:54:49] scriptures like that
[1:54:51] it it takes my breath away because when
[1:54:54] you see
[1:54:55] somebody can start in leviticus to me
[1:54:57] the book of leviticus
[1:54:59] is the gospels of the old testament
[1:55:02] matthew mark luke and john
[1:55:03] because leviticus i mean all the old
[1:55:05] testament is but leviticus particularly
[1:55:07] because it lays out the priesthood of
[1:55:09] christ and how
[1:55:11] how he's going to live and what he's
[1:55:12] going to be in the sacrifice that he's
[1:55:14] going to be
[1:55:15] and when you can see how it was supposed
[1:55:17] to be
[1:55:18] in the pattern in leviticus and then you
[1:55:20] go to first kings and you see elijah
[1:55:22] following that pattern
[1:55:24] and then you jump you know now you're
[1:55:26] jumping from leviticus
[1:55:28] probably 15 centuries and you see
[1:55:32] here comes jesus and he's walking
[1:55:34] exactly like elijah
[1:55:35] exactly like the book of leviticus and
[1:55:37] then you take another 2 000 year leap
[1:55:39] from there and you come to our day
[1:55:41] and you go wow i get it bang bang bang
[1:55:44] bang here oh it's me right
[1:55:47] that was for this amen that's what paul
[1:55:50] said that's what that was for so that
[1:55:51] you
[1:55:52] right now you are the ones upon whom the
[1:55:55] ends of the world
[1:55:56] have come amen and i i thought about how
[1:55:59] that
[1:56:01] you know that frankincense doesn't begin
[1:56:03] to be activated until the heat
[1:56:06] and i tell you this world brings some
[1:56:08] heat doesn't it friends
[1:56:09] the trials and afflictions that we face
[1:56:12] and
[1:56:13] you know if we're to be that living
[1:56:15] sacrifice
[1:56:16] it has to come and i thought that was an
[1:56:19] amazing statement
[1:56:21] brother and i never thought about that
[1:56:22] i've thought about it but never heard it
[1:56:24] never thought of the way you said it
[1:56:26] that israel had never seen a lamb
[1:56:31] sacrificed quietly they had never seen a
[1:56:35] lamb come to the sacrifice and
[1:56:36] not make a sound what a
[1:56:40] what a fulfillment how much greater the
[1:56:43] lamb of god was than all the millions of
[1:56:45] lambs that had
[1:56:46] ever been slain and you know
[1:56:49] the heat and the trials and the things
[1:56:51] that we're going through right now
[1:56:54] you know if i look back on the
[1:56:58] astonishment as brother ernie drew the
[1:57:00] picture for us
[1:57:02] and all those perhaps hundreds wouldn't
[1:57:05] surprise him at all to see it as
[1:57:06] hundreds because he was
[1:57:07] famous throughout judea and is he gonna
[1:57:11] we've seen all these miracles this is
[1:57:12] the guy who created
[1:57:14] fish and bread and loaves and this guy
[1:57:16] who walked on the water this guy who
[1:57:17] raised the dead
[1:57:18] we're gonna see surely he's gonna get
[1:57:21] out of this
[1:57:22] and it looked like the greatest defeat
[1:57:24] in the world and it's so astonished
[1:57:26] everybody
[1:57:27] it even astonished his disciples
[1:57:30] to where peter just didn't even know
[1:57:31] what to do and he just looks at the
[1:57:33] crowd and says
[1:57:34] i don't know i just go i'm going back to
[1:57:36] work
[1:57:37] i can't even make sense of what we just
[1:57:39] saw cleopas
[1:57:40] on the road to emmaus and they're
[1:57:43] downcast
[1:57:44] they're exactly the opposite of what
[1:57:46] they ought to have been
[1:57:48] and it took jesus coming out and
[1:57:50] revealing himself to say i
[1:57:52] want this to have happened i'm here to
[1:57:53] say something friends i know that
[1:57:55] the heat and the trials are hot but i
[1:57:57] would say to you today ought not it to
[1:57:59] be this way
[1:57:59] [Music]
[1:58:01] should we have our heads hung down or
[1:58:02] should we be looking up
[1:58:04] if we can see it in leviticus and we can
[1:58:06] see it in in elijah
[1:58:08] and we can see it in christ and now it's
[1:58:10] upon us come on friends
[1:58:12] we're almost home yes my those patterns
[1:58:15] can't fail we're
[1:58:16] almost home and i just say wow
[1:58:20] that was that was a bit of all right as
[1:58:22] the brits would say
[1:58:24] this morning let's sing something the
[1:58:26] day
[1:58:28] before yesterday
[1:58:33] crucified my lord
[1:58:36] beat him unmercifully they beat him
[1:58:40] on mercifully and
[1:58:44] then nailed him to a tree
[1:58:49] the sky grew dark and the earth
[1:58:53] began to fall
[1:58:59] think about that scene the people
[1:59:03] cried surely
[1:59:07] we've crucified
[1:59:10] the son of god
[1:59:15] think about our day now why didn't we
[1:59:18] recognize the mighty god was here today
[1:59:40] [Music]
[1:59:43] is that a fair question shouldn't we
[1:59:46] have no shouldn't we
[1:59:47] have no
[1:59:52] wish we had known
[1:59:55] before the lord had come
[1:59:58] and gone amen let me read this here it's
[2:00:02] a prayer
[2:00:02] prayer request comes in pray for my
[2:00:04] cousin christopher
[2:00:06] khali i suppose clay
[2:00:08] [Music]
[2:00:21] okay all right
[2:00:26] goodness gracious i want you to bow your
[2:00:29] heads we'll take this
[2:00:30] prayer request to the lord before we go
[2:00:35] you know as brother matt is singing
[2:00:39] shouldn't we have recognized him it's
[2:00:42] easy friends
[2:00:43] all heads bowed now it's real easy to
[2:00:46] stand back as a believer
[2:00:49] and look at the world that didn't
[2:00:51] recognize him
[2:00:53] and and and almost ask incredibly
[2:00:56] incredulously shouldn't you have
[2:00:58] recognized him well what about
[2:00:59] you and i shouldn't we also
[2:01:02] recognize his authority in our lives in
[2:01:05] his word
[2:01:06] to be the lord of our lives would we
[2:01:09] stand back in judgment of the world when
[2:01:11] we ourselves have not allowed him to
[2:01:13] become lord and master of our own lives
[2:01:15] shouldn't we have known shouldn't we
[2:01:18] recognize shouldn't you see yourself in
[2:01:21] the pattern
[2:01:22] of the scripture today it's one thing to
[2:01:24] talk about as brother ernie demonstrated
[2:01:26] it's one thing to talk about jesus
[2:01:27] laying back on that cross
[2:01:29] but our but the real message today was
[2:01:31] are you able to do that
[2:01:34] i mean leviticus is great
[2:01:37] first kings is great the gospel story is
[2:01:39] great but now what about you
[2:01:41] what shall i do with jesus called the
[2:01:44] christ
[2:01:44] this is your hour to shine this is your
[2:01:47] hour
[2:01:48] to believe this is your hour to say this
[2:01:51] is the son of god and i intend to follow
[2:01:54] him
[2:01:56] you want to raise up a hand to the lord
[2:01:57] today and say father i want to
[2:01:59] please help me to become aware of my
[2:02:02] moment
[2:02:03] in this story amen lord hands up
[2:02:06] everywhere across the building
[2:02:09] i have no doubt hands up across the
[2:02:13] those connected by stream and lord
[2:02:17] we want to just raise up not only our
[2:02:18] hands but our whole hearts to you today
[2:02:20] lord let this message today let it
[2:02:23] become a reality in my life let it
[2:02:25] live in me lord it's not just
[2:02:27] information we didn't come here today
[2:02:29] just to gather information we came here
[2:02:32] to compare
[2:02:33] your word to our lives father there's
[2:02:38] there's only one thing that needs
[2:02:39] changing when that happens and it sure
[2:02:41] ain't the word
[2:02:44] our lives are always the ones that need
[2:02:46] adjusted
[2:02:48] so i pray you help us today lord
[2:02:50] shouldn't we have known
[2:02:52] shouldn't the world have known well
[2:02:54] shouldn't we have known also
[2:02:56] yes that god should have the lordship of
[2:02:59] our life right here at the finish line
[2:03:01] right here at the crossing over
[2:03:03] right here in the closing scenes of
[2:03:04] earth's history
[2:03:06] the last scenes of fallen man in the
[2:03:08] earth getting ready to change to a new
[2:03:10] millennial world
[2:03:11] this one's going to fade away god's
[2:03:13] gonna take away his hand of protection
[2:03:15] gonna pull the bride up out of the earth
[2:03:17] amen and the earth will spin off
[2:03:19] and lord destroy itself you'll start it
[2:03:22] again father
[2:03:24] help us today to be aware of that may we
[2:03:26] pinch ourselves and realize the
[2:03:28] immediacy
[2:03:29] of the moment an hour that we live in i
