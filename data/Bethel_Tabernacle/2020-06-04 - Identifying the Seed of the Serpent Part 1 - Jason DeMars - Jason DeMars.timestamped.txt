[0:08] good morning everyone
[0:10] may the lord richly bless you we are
[0:14] for those who are watching on facebook
[0:17] right now
[0:18] we had some technical issues so i'm
[0:20] going live right on my phone
[0:21] apologize it's not the same quality and
[0:24] sound quality but
[0:26] we're doing our best here so let's all
[0:28] stand and pray
[0:34] gracious heavenly father we just come to
[0:35] you lord and we're so thankful and so
[0:37] grateful for your goodness to us
[0:41] lord that regardless of the things that
[0:43] we go through in our lives and the
[0:45] difficulties and struggles and trials
[0:48] you're you're with us you promise to
[0:51] never leave us
[0:52] and never forsake us and lord this is
[0:55] where we get our confidence from this is
[0:58] where we get our joy from
[1:00] lord we just want to ask that your
[1:02] spirit would come
[1:04] and speak to our hearts and deal with us
[1:07] lord
[1:09] help me to get out of the way and may
[1:11] your word come forth to
[1:13] every heart we ask these things in jesus
[1:15] name
[1:16] amen god bless you can be seated we're
[1:19] going to start a new
[1:23] a new series may just be
[1:26] a few uh
[1:30] probably just two two sessions but it's
[1:33] gonna be on
[1:34] serpent seed identifying the seed of the
[1:37] serpent
[1:39] so we have this i kind of want to
[1:43] present it and look at it with
[1:44] fresh eyes not necessarily looking at it
[1:47] like
[1:48] well we believe this you know for 30
[1:50] years 40 years
[1:52] but look at it with fresh eyes from the
[1:55] scriptures
[1:56] in a way that somebody knew could hear
[1:59] and receive it
[2:02] so we have this strange story in the
[2:05] book of genesis about trees
[2:07] that can give eternal life or death a
[2:10] talking snake
[2:12] and so it it's so different from the
[2:15] character
[2:16] of the rest of the bible it should cause
[2:19] us to pause for a second
[2:21] and say the rest of the bible is dealing
[2:23] with such
[2:24] real solid things now we have
[2:27] something that doesn't seem to fit
[2:32] you know magical trees and
[2:36] and and um talking snakes
[2:39] so uh that there's
[2:42] it should speak to us and say there's a
[2:45] mystery
[2:46] here that god wants to unfold to us
[2:49] but we need to look at the rest of the
[2:51] bible to see
[2:53] what's happening here genesis 1
[2:58] 26 through 27
[3:01] and god said let us make man in our
[3:03] image after our likeness and let them
[3:04] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[3:06] and over the fowl of the air
[3:08] and over the cattle and over all the
[3:09] earth and over every creeping thing that
[3:11] creepeth upon the earth
[3:13] so god created man in his own image in
[3:15] the image of god created he him
[3:18] male and female created he
[3:21] them so this is god's
[3:25] initial charge to mankind
[3:29] this is where it starts and we have
[3:31] verse 28 and god bless them
[3:33] god said unto them be fruitful and
[3:34] multiply and replenish the earth and
[3:36] subdue it
[3:37] and have dominion over the fish of the
[3:39] over the fowl of the air and over every
[3:41] living thing that moves upon the earth
[3:42] so god's
[3:44] commandment to adam and eve was to
[3:48] multiply themselves god so so first of
[3:51] all
[3:52] god made them in his image and likeness
[3:55] we understand
[3:56] the two parts of creation one in spirit
[3:58] form then one into flesh
[4:00] but what they were they what god wanted
[4:02] them to reproduce
[4:04] was his own life so god
[4:08] put his life into adam and eve first he
[4:11] made them in spirit form then he put him
[4:12] in the flesh
[4:13] he said i want you to reproduce my life
[4:17] in human flesh so in a multiplied
[4:20] fashion
[4:21] and so this is what god charged them to
[4:24] do
[4:25] so then we look at the rest of the
[4:27] context of the scriptures
[4:29] we shouldn't lose track of god's first
[4:31] commandment
[4:32] because because what does god always do
[4:35] when he gives a command
[4:36] to us a test follows
[4:39] when god says i'm i want you to do this
[4:42] immediately
[4:43] who meets you there satan meets you
[4:46] there
[4:47] that's allowed and purposed by god
[4:50] because he doesn't he wants our faith
[4:52] to be solid right and un an untested
[4:57] person will never reach maturity an
[5:00] untested person never really has
[5:02] faith genesis 1 11 and 12
[5:07] a principle that god sets forth in
[5:09] scriptures and god said
[5:11] let the earth bring forth grass the herb
[5:13] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[5:14] yielding fruit after his kind
[5:16] whose seed is in itself upon the earth
[5:18] and it was so and the earth brought
[5:19] forth grass
[5:20] and herb yielding seed after his kind
[5:23] and the tree
[5:24] tree yielding fruit whose seed was
[5:26] itself
[5:27] after his kind and god saw that it was
[5:30] good two principles here one
[5:31] is all life is in
[5:35] the original all that life that comes
[5:37] after
[5:38] is in that original seed that god had
[5:40] made
[5:42] and that doesn't just mean for plant
[5:44] life that also means for animal life
[5:47] and that also means for human life
[5:50] so god to produce
[5:53] after it's kind he doesn't want it to
[5:55] produce
[5:57] a hybrid he wants the original life
[6:00] propagated genesis 2 9.
[6:04] okay so right right here we have god
[6:08] creating god saying reproduce
[6:11] and the next thing we say here in
[6:13] genesis 2 9 and out of the ground made
[6:15] the lord god to grow every tree
[6:18] that is pleasant to the sight and good
[6:20] for food
[6:21] the tree of life also in the midst of
[6:23] the garden and the tree of the knowledge
[6:25] of good and evil
[6:27] if you are looking at this verse
[6:30] right away it should stop you and say
[6:32] okay what is going on
[6:34] here yeah amen trees
[6:37] that are good for food i get it trees
[6:39] that are beautiful to look at
[6:40] i understand that but now you're telling
[6:43] me
[6:44] a tree of life and a tree of knowledge
[6:46] of good and evil
[6:49] it should again it should cause us to
[6:51] pause and say
[6:53] what's being said here is are these
[6:56] literal trees
[6:57] is there a hidden mystery here that the
[6:59] rest of scripture would reveal to us
[7:01] what is this all about
[7:04] genesis 2 16-17 and the lord god
[7:07] commanded the man saying
[7:08] of every tree of the garden thou mayest
[7:11] freely eat but of the tree of the
[7:12] knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
[7:14] not eat of it
[7:16] for in the day that thou eat us thereof
[7:18] thou shalt surely
[7:19] die so
[7:23] again is it seem in
[7:27] incongruity with the rest of the
[7:30] scripture so we
[7:31] here we have god say multiply and
[7:33] replenish the earth
[7:35] his his commandment is to do that and to
[7:37] take dominion
[7:39] next we see mystical trees put forward
[7:44] one that brings eternal life one that
[7:46] brings death
[7:48] and and then then we're here look at
[7:51] this
[7:51] is how does this
[7:55] fit in to the big picture of what god is
[7:58] painting
[7:59] in the first three chapters of genesis
[8:02] can they be literal trees revelation 2
[8:06] 7 he that hath an ear let him hear what
[8:09] the spirit saith unto the churches
[8:11] to him that overcometh while i give to
[8:13] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[8:15] midst
[8:16] of the paradise of god so
[8:19] where is the tree of life
[8:23] so god god never said he destroyed the
[8:26] tree of life
[8:28] in the book of genesis and here we find
[8:31] the tree of life is still
[8:33] in existence amen
[8:36] right all right so here are we talking
[8:40] about a literal tree
[8:43] eating of a literal tree of life
[8:46] that's in the midst of god's paradise so
[8:48] it's still in the same spot
[8:51] so if we're talking about literal tree
[8:53] literal geogra
[8:54] you know in a literal place of geography
[8:57] no doubt garden of eden was a literal
[8:59] place adam and eve were literal people
[9:02] not not disputing that whatsoever but
[9:04] what i'm saying is if the tree of life
[9:06] is a
[9:07] literal actual tree and it still exists
[9:10] in the paradise of god we should be able
[9:12] to find it
[9:13] we should be able to go to the middle
[9:14] east and search
[9:16] and locate the tree of life and we can
[9:19] take it and and no doubt it's multiplied
[9:22] since then
[9:24] there's more of them that and we can eat
[9:26] this fruit
[9:27] and have eternal life so
[9:32] you see it's these things are not
[9:33] incongruity with god's plan
[9:36] and god's program
[9:39] they're figurative trees this is
[9:41] obviously
[9:42] a figure of speech how do we how do we
[9:45] have eternal life well first of all if
[9:46] you're predestinated seed
[9:48] you always had eternal life you're
[9:50] simply recognizing
[9:52] when you when you recognize the savior
[9:54] and him
[9:56] who he is and accept that sacrifice
[9:59] god enters to you as you're saved
[10:03] but we always we always were saved we
[10:05] always had a part of that life
[10:07] but that life is a gift it's given to us
[10:11] by almighty god and it's not from
[10:14] eating a literal fruit
[10:20] genesis 3 14-15
[10:23] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[10:25] because thou hast done this thou art
[10:27] cursed above all cattle and above
[10:28] every beast of the field upon thy belly
[10:31] shalt thou go
[10:32] and dust shalt thou eat all the days of
[10:34] thy life
[10:35] and i will put enmity between thee and
[10:37] the woman
[10:39] and between thy seed and her seed it
[10:41] shall bruise thy head
[10:43] and thou shalt bruise his heel
[10:47] so again
[10:50] god said multiply and replenish the
[10:52] earth god said don't eat of these trees
[10:56] then the serpent comes causes the woman
[10:59] to eat
[11:00] from that tree and the next thing you
[11:02] know is there's two offspring
[11:07] okay so the eight of the tree now we're
[11:09] talking about two offspring
[11:11] so what does it mean to each of the tree
[11:16] genesis 3 1-2 now the serpent was more
[11:19] subtle than any beast of the field which
[11:21] the lord god had made
[11:22] and he said unto the woman yea hath god
[11:24] said you shall not eat of every tree of
[11:26] the garden
[11:27] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[11:29] may eat
[11:31] of the fruit of the trees of the garden
[11:35] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[11:37] the midst of the garden god has said you
[11:38] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[11:40] touch it lest ye die
[11:42] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[11:44] shall not surely die for god doth know
[11:46] that in the day
[11:47] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[11:49] opened and you shall be as gods
[11:51] knowing good and evil i wanna
[11:55] just back up there a second we were
[11:58] talking about
[12:00] that progression and i want to emphasize
[12:02] that before i
[12:03] continue on and talk about what this
[12:05] serpent was
[12:07] so again we have god's commandment in
[12:11] the beginning
[12:12] multiply replenish the earth then he
[12:14] says don't eat of the tree
[12:17] of the knowledge of good and evil
[12:20] they do that and then what's the results
[12:24] when god comes to curse the serpent he's
[12:27] talking about
[12:28] offspring then he goes and
[12:32] we'll read it shortly then he goes to
[12:34] the woman and he says i will
[12:36] multiply your pain in childbirth
[12:41] so there's there's there's multiple
[12:44] things that fit together
[12:45] in perfection and there's one thing
[12:48] that's a mystery which is
[12:50] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[12:51] evil the rest of it's
[12:53] actually really clear that there was
[12:57] two two offspring involved god's
[13:00] commandment was to multiply and
[13:01] replenish the earth
[13:02] god's cursing her uh uh
[13:06] birth process with pain and
[13:10] so then we have this part that doesn't
[13:12] seem to fit
[13:13] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[13:15] evil
[13:17] the whole picture points to this one
[13:19] thing and that that
[13:20] those trees are not literal trees
[13:23] god wasn't saying don't eat a literal
[13:26] fruit
[13:26] but that it was a figure of speech very
[13:29] clear
[13:30] so then we go to the serpent and you see
[13:32] you'll see all the pictures
[13:34] and children's story story bibles and
[13:36] all this and
[13:37] it's either some kind of red lizard or a
[13:41] snake with a couple of feet on it and
[13:44] it's all
[13:44] complete nonsense
[13:47] no basis no basis in reality
[13:52] i want to read to you what adam clark
[13:55] a tremendous bible commentator from the
[13:57] late 1800s
[13:58] wrote about this account in as he was
[14:02] unpacking what
[14:03] actually this serpent was
[14:06] he says that whatever the nakhosh was
[14:10] he stood at the head of all inferior
[14:12] animals for wisdom and understanding so
[14:14] what he's what he's saying there is that
[14:17] this word that we translate to
[14:19] english as serpent which to
[14:23] any casual reader a serpent means a
[14:24] snake
[14:26] but what he's saying is that this so
[14:29] this term
[14:30] nakash if you look at it it's translated
[14:33] in many different ways
[14:35] throughout the old testament it's not
[14:37] just translated snake
[14:39] sometimes its meaning is crocodile
[14:41] sometimes its meeting is
[14:44] is brass sometimes its meaning is
[14:47] uh like a medium
[14:51] in in other words like a like a witch or
[14:53] a wizard
[14:54] right sometimes its meaning is uh
[14:57] adultery sometimes its meaning is
[15:01] uh like handcuffs basically
[15:05] this is what they would say and so the
[15:07] word
[15:08] changes based on the context that it's
[15:11] used
[15:12] in and so you have to see what is
[15:15] what is being spoken of based on the
[15:18] context
[15:19] so we'll pick up from there that
[15:21] whatever this nakhas was
[15:23] he stood at the head of all inferior
[15:25] animals for wisdom and understanding
[15:28] that he walked erect for this is
[15:30] necessarily implied in his punishment
[15:32] on thy belly i.e on all fours shalt thou
[15:35] go
[15:36] that he was endued with the gift of
[15:38] speech for a conversation
[15:40] is here related between him and the
[15:41] woman
[15:43] that he was also endued with the gift of
[15:45] reason for we find him reasoning and
[15:47] disputing with eve
[15:49] that these things were common to this
[15:51] creature the woman no doubt
[15:54] having often seen him walk erect talk
[15:57] and reason
[15:58] and therefore she testifies no kind of
[16:00] surprise when he accosts her in the
[16:01] language
[16:02] related in the text and indeed from the
[16:05] manner in which this is introduced it
[16:06] appears to be only a part of a
[16:08] conversation
[16:09] that had passed between them on the
[16:12] occasion
[16:12] yeah god said etc
[16:16] so we see here a bible commentary he
[16:19] didn't he didn't believe in
[16:20] the serpent seed doctrine but here he's
[16:24] looking
[16:24] at this serpent and he's saying
[16:28] we're not talking about a snake we're
[16:30] talking about something that
[16:31] walked on two feet that had was the most
[16:35] intelligent of all the animals
[16:37] that was able to speak and not only was
[16:39] he able to speak he was able to reason
[16:43] and these were normal things for this
[16:47] serpent to do if it wasn't if it wasn't
[16:49] something that the serpent did and all
[16:51] of a sudden satan
[16:52] magically gave him the ability to speak
[16:54] which god can
[16:55] god has done that and satan could do
[16:58] that
[16:58] we're not saying that that's not
[16:59] possible what we're saying is that
[17:02] if that was the case eve would have been
[17:04] like
[17:06] what's happening i'm running
[17:10] this is not right yeah but it wasn't it
[17:12] was the norm
[17:14] they had conversations they spoke
[17:15] together and
[17:17] and this was an ongoing thing
[17:27] brother branham says in questions and
[17:28] answers number one in 1954
[17:31] and the serpent was not a reptile the
[17:33] curse made him a reptile he was just
[17:35] like a man he walked upright
[17:37] he was with this woman out there and she
[17:39] committed this adultery and brought
[17:40] forth her first
[17:41] son which was cain the nature of his
[17:44] daddy
[17:47] we spoke about it before but i'll read
[17:49] it here in john 3
[17:50] john 3 16 genesis 3 16
[17:54] unto the woman he said i will greatly
[17:56] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[17:59] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[18:01] children and thy desire
[18:03] shall be to thy husband and he shall
[18:06] rule
[18:06] over thee the bible says an
[18:10] eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
[18:12] in other words the punishment
[18:14] is to be commensurate to the crime
[18:17] so she committed a sin
[18:22] with that part of the body and therefore
[18:24] god
[18:25] places a curse upon that part of the
[18:27] body
[18:28] how ridiculous could it be she eats a
[18:31] fruit
[18:33] then then god goes to the serpent and
[18:35] says
[18:37] i'm gonna put a curse between your
[18:38] offspring and the woman's offspring and
[18:40] they're going
[18:41] what's he done what does he mean
[18:46] and then he says to the woman i'm going
[18:47] to increase your sorrow in childbearing
[18:50] hey i just ate an apple
[18:54] you're going gonna make me have pain
[18:56] when i give birth
[18:57] that's not fair god is just
[19:02] god is righteous god is holy he doesn't
[19:05] just change subjects
[19:06] all of a sudden from eating fruit
[19:09] he could have said they're in pain you
[19:12] will
[19:12] eat fruit and you'll have a toothache
[19:16] and you're you'll have stomach pains
[19:18] right
[19:19] when you eat this fruit he did he didn't
[19:22] say that
[19:23] he punished exactly this with the sin
[19:26] that they committed amen
[19:30] so god's command is to multiply and
[19:32] replenish the earth
[19:33] i know i'm repeating but that's part
[19:35] teaching you repeat repeat repeat
[19:38] god's command is to multiply and
[19:39] replenish the earth
[19:41] then god commands them not to eat from
[19:43] the tree of knowledge
[19:45] then god's putting in betw enmity
[19:48] between
[19:49] two genetic lines then god curses the
[19:52] birth process
[19:53] and puts eve's desire towards
[19:56] her husband so
[20:00] what does that have to do with eating
[20:02] fruit
[20:05] your desire will be to your husband well
[20:06] you desired that apple so now i'm going
[20:08] to have you desire
[20:09] your husband instead your desire went
[20:11] away from your husband
[20:13] now i'm putting your desire towards your
[20:15] husband
[20:17] it's simple
[20:20] second corinthians 11 2
[20:23] and 3 for i am jealous over you with
[20:26] godly jealousy
[20:28] for i have espoused you to one husband
[20:31] that i may present you as a chaste
[20:33] virgin to christ
[20:35] but i fear lest by any means as the
[20:37] serpent beguiled eve through his
[20:39] subtility
[20:40] so your mind should be corrupted from
[20:42] the simplicity
[20:44] that is in christ
[20:48] for if he that cometh preaches another
[20:49] jesus whom we have not preached or if
[20:51] you receive another spirit
[20:52] which ye have not received or another
[20:54] gospel which you have not accepted he
[20:56] you might well bear with him
[21:00] so let's go through this first the
[21:03] church is engaged as a verge don't read
[21:06] ahead
[21:07] church is engaged as a virgin to christ
[21:11] and he likens this to eve being engaged
[21:14] to as a virgin
[21:16] to adam but paul fears lest the church
[21:20] by adultery commits adultery by
[21:24] accepting a false word
[21:28] so he compares then he compares that to
[21:30] the original sin
[21:32] so if paul fears the church committing
[21:34] adultery
[21:35] and commit commits compares
[21:52] here it's assumed right there that
[21:55] people
[21:55] the people would understand that the
[21:57] original sin
[21:59] was adultery and not eating
[22:02] an apple
[22:06] proverbs 30 verse 20 such as the way of
[22:08] an adulterous woman
[22:09] she eateth and wipeth her mouth and
[22:11] saith i have done
[22:12] no wickedness straight strange thing to
[22:16] say
[22:17] if you don't understand the original sin
[22:20] if you see what happened in the garden
[22:22] he likens that act
[22:25] of adultery unto eating
[22:30] song of solomon 4 12 a garden enclosed

[22:42] garden that the spices thereof may flow
[22:44] out let my beloved come to his garden
[22:47] and eat his pleasant fruits
[22:50] i am come into my garden my sister my
[22:52] spouse i've gathered my myrrh with my
[22:54] spice i've eaten my honeycomb with my
[22:56] honey

[23:04] commentary on that

[23:08] saying
[23:09] and it's likening those things unto
