TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Good morning. Let's all stand. Have a word of prayer. Dear gracious father, Lord, we come before you this morning, Lord, on this rainy Sunday morning. Father, we thank you for the rain, Lord. For without it, that Lord, we couldn't live. Father, we take it as a type of your Holy Spirit pouring down upon us, Lord. That Father, we would take it and grow from it. Lord, that we would ask that your spirit would rain down in the building this morning. That Lord, that your spirit would move. That we would open our hearts. That you would anoint our hearts for revelation and for understanding. that Father that you would change what need to be changed and encourage where we would be weak. Father, uplift us and bring us closer to you. Father, we would invite you into our into our midst this morning in Jesus precious name. Amen. Um we want to um continue our thought that we've been uh we've been teaching on um titled Why are we here? And um uh I want to um if I can pull my notes up. This would be part five, I believe. Um and I want to uh we'll turn as a text. We'll go to St. John chapter 13. This is St. John chapter 13. And we'll start at um the 31st verse. St. John 13 and 31. Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, "Now is the son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him." Little children, yet a little while, I am with you. Ye, ye shall seek me. And as I said unto the Jews, wheither I go, ye cannot come. So now I say to you, a new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another. Bless the reading of the word. Y'all can be seated. So, I want to take as a subtitle this morning. Um, so my title is why are we here? And as a subtitle, love is a verb, right? We we all know remember from school what a verb is, &gt;&gt; right? A verb is an action. It's the it's the kind of words that denote an action, right? It's something that you're doing, &gt;&gt; right? You know, running is a verb. It denotes movement. You know, fighting is a is a verb. It denotes movement. Love, loving is a verb. It denotes actions. It denotes lifestyle. It denotes doing things. It's not just simply a a feeling. You know, if it's really a feeling that's that's true, then it'll it'll do something in your life. It will do something through your life. I want to uh this is a a quote that I've read several times now, but I want to read it again. Um this is from the message oneness in February the 11th, 1962. Um he says that's God's purpose and his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family earthly family Adam and Eve and the only way that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them. So that made them with God's nature in them. Then with each other and God they became all one. Isn't that a beautiful picture? God in in his family, father over all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so this is the purpose of God. This is we could sum it all up in one paragraph. The purpose of God is to have oneness between himself and his family and his family one with another. That's the purpose of God. And so, um, I want to, uh, we'll pick up. This is first John verse 11. For this is the message that you heard from the beginning that we should love one another, not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore he slew him? Because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous. Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. We know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren. &gt;&gt; Right? That's that's how we know we pass from death to life is because we love one another. &gt;&gt; He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. Whereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But who so hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him. &gt;&gt; My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things. &gt;&gt; Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. So again here in first John what he's denoting here is that you know we're kind of reiterating you know it doesn't really matter um what you say with your mouth matters what you do right to some extent there's love is not just simply you know shaking somebody's hand and saying I love you it's not just you know telling people that you love them. It's doing, it's acting, it's behaving in a way that is self-sacrificial on their behalf. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? You know, elsewhere the Bible says, "What you know, greater love hath any man that he would give his life for his friends." Right? You know, laying down your life is, you know, it says here that uh whereby we perceive the love of God because he he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. &gt;&gt; Right? You lay your life down. You you sacrifice your own desires. You sacrifice your own uh lifestyle in in many ways because it's that's you know your your life isn't just living, right? Laying your life down doesn't just mean dying for someone. Sometimes it just it mean it also means laying down your your um you know your own wishes, right? you sacrificing what your own pleasures in life to do something something for somebody else and we we do this you know not because you know it's it's like a you know with a man and a woman you know with me and my wife I don't I don't do things for my wife because I'm obligated to right there's not some government agency somewhere that's going to throw me in jail if I don't buy my wife flowers, &gt;&gt; right? I'm sure plenty of sisters wish there was but but you know it doesn't exist. You know, at the end of the day, the the your marriage is between the two of you. And &gt;&gt; I don't I don't do things for my wife because I, you know, am obligated to or it's some, you know, I have some some penalty over hanging over my head if I don't. It's because I love my wife, right? I I want I you know it's it turns out you can like 12 bucks at Publix can buy you a lot more flowers than you might think and it's like the best 12 bucks I'll ever spend, right? Like it's it you know it's like it lights my whole day up. And so you know it it it's it's you know how much more does God want to do that to for one another? And how much more, you know, just going seeing somebody at church or or seeing knowing somebody's having a hard time or knowing that brother, that sister might not have anybody right now or or whatever whatever the situation is. when you know somebody's in a, you know, kind of in a in a in a in a dark place or is having a hard time that that you being the God with skin on it and saying, "I'm going to, you know, even if even if you don't really know them that well, even if you're not really close to that person, making the effort to go above and beyond and shake their hand and and and include them, invite them out to, you know, over to dinner or whatever, you know, invite them over to have some fellowship. go reach out to them because that's the Christ in you, right? The Christ will leave the 99 and go for the one, &gt;&gt; you know, and it's not just it's not just those that are lost, it's those that are hurting, &gt;&gt; you know, it's those that listen, God's people are sheep, &gt;&gt; right? God's people are sheep. And when lions hunt sheep, they don't attack the herd, right? They attack the one. They run the herd and isolate the one. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's this is a a anecdote I heard once. Um, so when lions hunt zebras, the you know, zebras all have stripes. Stripes are camouflage. But what in the world are zebra stripes blending into? It's not grass. It's not bushes. They live out on the on the plains. There's nothing to hide behind. What do the stripes camouflage them against? They camouflage them against the herd. You can't They're all all the zebras look exactly the same. You can't tell which one's which. And you can't just hunt, you know, the conceptual zebra. You have to hunt a particular zebra. And so what happens is when you have a whole herd of zebras, the lions can't figure out which one they're looking at to to hunt them. So, and we figured this out that the the purpose of zebra camouflage is to camouflage them against the herd because when biologists were trying to study zebras, they couldn't figure out which zebra was which either. So, they said, "I know when we have a particular zebra we want to track, we'll go take a red paintbrush and stick it with a red paintbrush so that's the one we're looking for." And they were able to tell which one the zebra which zebra they were looking at. And so could the lions. And every zebra that they tagged with a red paintbrush got devoured within 24 hours. Right? The if you I the devil's goal is to isolate people &gt;&gt; to drive wedges because when those when there's a wedge and he can split somebody off from the group and get not even necessarily physically. They still come to church. They still even might, you know, come to fellowship. They might come to, you know, to uh to partake, you know, fellowship and and have friends and they're they're still close, but in their heart they feel alone in a crowd, &gt;&gt; right? In their heart, they don't feel the connection to the people. In their heart, they don't feel the kinship that they once did. And that's the devil driving that wedge in there. That's why God's purpose is oneness. There's strength. It it's again it's not for nothing that they were on the day of Pentecost in one minded one accord gathered together, right? You have to hold tight to your brothers and sisters in Christ because they're going to give you strength. They're going to give you encouragement. And if the devil can make you feel isolated, can make anyone feel isolated, then then they're then now they're an easy target, right? You know, now they're now that's when the devil can come in and say, "Oh, that group's just a bunch of hypocrites anyways. because they're supposed to have the love of God in their heart and nobody cares about you, &gt;&gt; right? Well, don't let the devil have that place. Don't be proactive. Be, you know, when you see the one getting split from the herd, move the whole herd, &gt;&gt; right? Don't like just don't let that happen. Be proactive. And if and if you feel the devil isolating you, recognize that it's the devil. Recognize that it's the devil trying to separate you and that you need to fight against that wholesale. Reach out to somebody. find somebody. Be proactive. &gt;&gt; You know, don't lay down and die, &gt;&gt; right? Be proactive. You know, it's so hard when the devil when the devil's coming against you and trying to make you feel alone and make you feel like you're, you know, you know, you're sitting under your juniper tree going, "Lord, just let me die. I'm all alone out here." &gt;&gt; No, there's there's 4,000 who haven't bowed the knee to bail. Right? There's thousands of there's people all around you, but it's it's the devil trying to trying to uh trying to break up the the oneness and the unity of God's family. So, it's important that we we do things. We don't just um we don't just say it's not just lip service, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um you I have some bullet points here. It says, "Having love one for another is the key to demonstrating the power of the Holy Ghost in this or any day. It doesn't matter how big your bank account, how big your house, how noble your profession, or how global your ministry is. Without the expression of the pure love of God to all those God has placed in your life, you prove by your nature that you have not passed from death unto life." Okay, this is from perseverance. Uh, brother um, McGary read this last Sunday and it just I want to read it again. U, this is from Perseverance. And the whole armor of God is faith, love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, meekness, gentleness, patience. The whole armor of the believer is faith. We believe God by faith because God said so. Then what is it? Abraham was justified by Paul by faith, but by James by works. Abraham was talk uh what Abraham was talking what God saw and James was talking what man saw. Show me your faith by your works without your works and so forth. Then if you don't have works with your faith, it shows you haven't got faith. You're just talking from your mouth. But if you really got faith, you believe it and act like it. That's right. Put it in action. And this is the scripture he's referencing in James chapter 2 verse 14. What do it profit my brethren? Though a man say he hath faith and have not works, can faith save him? If a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled. Notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body, what does it profit? Right? So it, you know, we want to, it's kind of like the story I told about the man who got lost on the death on the on the island, right? And he prayed, "Oh, the Lord's going to deliver me from this island and the boat comes and he says, "Oh no, the Lord, I don't need a boat. The Lord's going to deliver me." And then the helicopter comes. I don't need a helicopter. The Lord's going to deliver me. And then he dies. &gt;&gt; And then when he, you know, goes to heaven, the Lord's like, "I gave you a boat and a helicopter. What else were you looking for?" &gt;&gt; Right? This is what happens. You know, we have those in need amongst us. you know all everybody has people in need if not of and I and I'll get to this I would like to expand on this more in a minute but not just of necessarily of money don't don't make it so um you know monetary though there are people who who have need of financial things and we should help that when we can as well you know people are in a tight spot look even if you can't don't have the money you know times are tough for everybody it's not like you know everybody has money to give away but listen when when you know uh someone's you know a man gets hurt in the in the church and gets laid up and can't work and times are tough. You know, it used to be pretty normal that the church would bind together and all the sisters bake that family dinner. You know, they all make them dinner. That's not it's not a crazy notion, right? In fact, it was long before we had welfare programs, federal welfare programs, we had the church, right? The church was your social safety net. The church was the the people who were supposed to take care of you when things went really bad, right? whenever when people were sick, when people were hurt, you know, and and even beyond that, you know, it's the when people have need of emotional support, &gt;&gt; you know, when people are going have a loss in the family, it, you know, it's you're the people that they they need to be able to turn to for that emotional support to get them through that. You know, when people are having a hard time dealing with in this day and age when mental illness and depression and anxiety are so rampant, we need to have be able to turn one to the other and say, "Hey, I'm struggling right now. I you know, I'm having a hard time." And if they can't do that, then we don't have unity and and we're getting um you know, we're getting isolated, but we should be able to provide that to one to the other. And it's one thing to say, you know, when people, oh, brother, I'm I'm struggling right now for what with whatever thing. Oh, yeah. Well, you know, the Lord bless you. I'll be praying for you, brother. Okay, that's good. You should do that. You should pray for them. You know, have faith, brother. Yes, but you may have the ability to actually help them. You may be the answer to their prayer, right? Why? Don't don't you do we understand what I'm saying here? Like this isn't it's one thing you can't just be like, "Oh, brother, I know you're in need right now, but um have faith." Well, do you have what they have need of? Can you provide that? Do don't don't just wish them God's speed and send them on their way still cold, destitute, naked, and hungry, right? No, you do it. Do what you can, you know? Don't What was the point of that? Why did God put them in front of you if it wasn't to bless them? So what? You could, you know, tell them they're on their own. No, it's the the faith that you have. If you want to, if you say that you have faith in the word, if you say that you have the faith of in God, and notice in here when when James is talking about faith, he's not talking about faith as sort of like though this is part of it, not but not just simply faith like faith for healing, but the faith of like the Christian faith, &gt;&gt; right? It's are you a Christian? If you are a Christian and you are Christlike and you do what Christ would do, then you will be a provider because Jehovah is Jehovah provider, &gt;&gt; right? Jehovah Gyra should be in you. And so when people when his people have needs, you should be trying to be proactive to supply that need when and where you can. &gt;&gt; Um even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone. Yay, a man may say, "Thou hast faith, thou hast faith, and I have works. Show me thy faith without works, and I will show thee my faith by my works. Thou believest that there is one God, thou doest well. The devil also believes and tremble." But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead. Okay, you, we can say we're Christians. We can say that we love one another. We can say all these things, but if we have absolutely no interest in fellowshipping one another, really, are you sure about that? Right? How confident are you that you really love your brothers if you don't want anything to do with them? Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, how much how much love do you have one towards the other if there's no desire in your heart to be Jehovah with skin on it for them to be the the provider of the needs of the of the church body? Everybody has their part to play. Not everybody can do everything, right? Not everybody can do everything. But what part you can't? Even if it's as simple as simple, like I said, even if it's as simple as someone, you know, they're having a hard time, everybody's sick, and you decide to just bake them a casserole. &gt;&gt; If that's all you can do, then that's all it is. I know, um, Sister Emily Curtis sings this song. I I particularly love this song. Um, but there's a line in there that says, "If if uh if just a cup of water I place within your hands, then just a cup of water is all that I demand." Right? If all God gave you was a gift to be there for someone, then be there for them. &gt;&gt; That's all that's all that's required of you. Do what God use the ox code that God put in your hand. Right? If okay, you might not be the great ministry who's going to circumn the globe of preaching to all the lost souls, but you may be the one who for whatever reason is able to build a close connection with a young person and help them through a difficult time and be the God with skin on it to that lost soul in particular. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? You don't know what you can do. You know, whatever it is that you can do, do it as unto the Lord. Do it with all of your might. Be as let God work through that little thing. Little is a whole lot when God is doing it. Right? You know that those two loaves and, you know, five loaves and two fishes will end up feeding 5,000 people before it's all said and done because all you did was offer your little gift to the Lord, right? It doesn't have don't make this a um don't [clears throat] despi despise not the day of small things. &gt;&gt; Right? And I'll and I'll finish with this because I'm out of time here. It says, "The working of love starts at home." This is from 1 Timothy 5:8. But if any provide not for his own, especially for those in his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel. Matthew 6 verse 19. [clears throat] Uh, lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Listen, you're you might not be called to go spread the gospel to the seven continents, even to the Antarctica with the penguins. There's still there's still people down there, too. You might not be called to all of that, but you might be just a mom. And there's no such thing as just a mom. Just doesn't come into being a mom, right? Moms are the I mean, they're the future of the human race. I mean, it's it's only it's only the future of humanity. So, it's just, you know, no no no pressure. Um, you know, you're you're only bearing 10,000 worlds in your hand. You know, that that baby is only the most precious thing that God ever put on the earth. So, there's no just about it. It's the most important thing that you'll ever do. It's the most important thing pretty much any any human being will ever do, right? I can only I can only do so much. ministry gets, you know, maybe an hour at best, two hours a couple times a week with people in a in a group. Moms get every single day, every hour of every day with that baby. And your mission field is the baby God put in your hands, right? You have such an opportunity. you it'll so many people at the end of the day brother brother Brandham said that if if there was a fifth gospel written it would be the love of a mother &gt;&gt; right what is the gospel it's the life of Christ presented to people to say there's good news that your life could be better mom you're the first version of God that baby's ever going to see you let God operate through you and you will be Christ to that baby you will be the good news to that baby that when that little kid grows up and becomes a rebellious teenager, they will see mama loving them through all of that and say, "There's a better way of being, right? I don't have to live this way because mom loves me." And that isn't nothing. It's not small. That's not Listen, I really got to quit, but I'll I'll finish by with this statement. When Jesus fed 5,000 people with five loaves and two fishes, it was a little boy who brought that food to him. The little boy didn't make his own lunch. &gt;&gt; Right? The he the the unsung hero of that story was the mom who took time to make her little boy lunch. Right? She was doing her job. She was doing her calling. And it was through her handiwork that it made it into the hands of Jesus. So do make your kids lunch, right? Do what you need to do because that's God. You're shining your light for your kids. Anyways, that's it. That's all I got. God bless you guys. Let's stand and have a quick word of prayer. Father, we come before you this morning. We thank you for this time that we've had. Lord, we ask that you would take the words that I've spoken, Lord, and that you would just take it and it would it would not something that I would have said of my own thinking, Lord, but something that you could anoint little piece of your word, Father, that would fall into somebody's heart that they could hold on to. Lord, give them strength by it. Encourage the people, Father. We ask these things in your holy and precious name, Lord Jesus.
