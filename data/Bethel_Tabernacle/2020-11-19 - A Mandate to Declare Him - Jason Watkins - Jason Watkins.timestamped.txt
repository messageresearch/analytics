[35:27] wednesday night

[35:50] so we

[35:53] way through december
[35:54] so amen praise the lord hebrews
[35:58] chapter 2 i want to take tonight and
[36:00] just begin a thought we're going to go
[36:03] um we're going to put start at verse 8
[36:07] in
[36:07] hebrews chapter 2. i want to start a ser
[36:10] not a series but at least a two-part
[36:13] that i will get to part one of it
[36:16] tonight
[36:17] i want to take a mandate to declare him
[36:22] a mandate to declare him and
[36:25] as a subtitle tonight that we want to
[36:28] concentrate on because i'm going to
[36:30] enlarge on this whole thought on sunday
[36:32] lord willing
[36:33] but as a subtitle tonight i'd like to
[36:36] aim
[36:37] at certainty in a time of uncertainty
[36:40] i'm glad that there's a certainty even
[36:43] in a time of uncertainty
[36:45] amen and these are very uncertain times
[36:49] for the world
[36:49] quite a fearful time but my what a peace
[36:52] that the bride has
[36:54] in the word of god in this hour
[36:58] let's catch from chapter 2 verse 8.
[37:03] speaking of christ of course thou has
[37:06] put all things
[37:07] in subjection under his feet
[37:10] for in that he put all in subjection
[37:13] under him
[37:15] he left nothing that is not put under
[37:17] him
[37:18] but now we see not
[37:22] yet all things put under him but we see
[37:24] jesus
[37:26] who was made a little lower than the
[37:27] angels for the suffering of death
[37:30] crowned with glory and honor that he
[37:34] by the grace of god should taste death
[37:37] for every man
[37:39] for it became him for whom are all
[37:41] things
[37:42] and by whom are all things in bringing
[37:45] many
[37:46] sons unto glory to make the captain of
[37:49] their salvation
[37:50] perfect through sufferings for both he
[37:53] that sanctifieth and they who are
[37:56] sanctified
[37:58] are all of one do you believe that amen
[38:02] i mean he's literally put you on the
[38:04] same boat with jesus
[38:05] all right all right for which cause
[38:09] he christ is not ashamed to call them
[38:12] that's us brethren saying quite
[38:16] catch it verse saying i will
[38:19] declare thy name unto my brethren
[38:22] in the midst of the church i will sing
[38:25] praise
[38:26] unto thee let's bow our heads now master
[38:31] we thank you for this word now lord i'm
[38:33] just going as you've led me throughout
[38:36] the day lord i've had this thought
[38:37] simmering lord for some number of days
[38:40] and i felt the time was right lord to
[38:43] move into this material this evening
[38:45] so i pray now master you know who would
[38:47] be here you know he'd be listening
[38:48] you know what needs to be said i don't
[38:50] but you do
[38:51] so i i know that i have your inspiration
[38:54] upon me
[38:55] so i commit myself into your hands on
[38:57] this wednesday night lord
[38:59] we're going to go to prayer just in a
[39:00] little bit father and so we want to
[39:03] look into the word of god something to
[39:05] encourage our faith lord something to
[39:07] challenge us
[39:07] something to challenge us to believe
[39:10] every word of god
[39:11] master there must be a people there must
[39:14] be
[39:15] in this day and hour that we live in
[39:17] there must be a people who are not
[39:19] ashamed
[39:19] to declare the whole council of god to
[39:22] the world
[39:23] grant it to us master we desire it of
[39:25] thee in jesus name
[39:27] amen god bless you friends you can be
[39:29] seated
[39:41] certainty in a time of uncertainty
[39:46] as my subtitle tonight on this um
[39:50] two-part at least a mandate to declare
[39:53] him
[39:54] so you know paul is making it clear
[39:57] that that jesus was going to make a
[40:00] declaration his whole life was a
[40:02] declaration
[40:03] and he declared a lot of things he
[40:05] declared you know his identity to the
[40:07] world
[40:08] some believed most did not he declared
[40:11] why he was here some believed a few but
[40:14] most didn't believe that they didn't
[40:16] accept the message
[40:18] uh his his declaration of who he was
[40:22] and why he had came now you know the
[40:25] world today
[40:26] is in a very great state of confusion
[40:29] and uncertainty
[40:30] fear perilous times the bible calls it
[40:33] and we know that men's hearts are even
[40:35] failing for the fear that they're in and
[40:38] you hear it today you hear it all over
[40:40] the news unsettling times and
[40:42] you know strange and uncertain times but
[40:44] you know it's it's interesting to me
[40:47] how that i was thinking about this you
[40:49] know you know this evening was just
[40:51] pondering this and i thought lord
[40:53] you know what it for me in my heart if i
[40:55] would really preach my heart tonight
[40:57] that's why i took
[40:58] the subtitle that right here in an age
[41:01] uh where everything is uncertain i want
[41:04] you to know there is a certainty
[41:06] there is a certainty that is among us
[41:09] you can enjoy it
[41:12] or not you can partake of it
[41:15] or not it's up to you if you wanna
[41:19] now here's what you can't escape
[41:21] perilous times
[41:24] you can't escape that you're the
[41:27] judgments
[41:27] are falling upon the world hey guess
[41:30] what you live here
[41:31] now we'd all like to already be gone in
[41:33] the rapture before covet 19 hit but we
[41:36] didn't
[41:36] we're here and it's here and here we are
[41:39] amen
[41:40] there's turmoil in the land social
[41:42] turmoil social unrest
[41:44] political unrest political turmoil
[41:47] they're they're you know
[41:48] they're in great fear today i was
[41:50] sitting in you know
[41:51] in the barbershop and well if you want
[41:53] to hear every kind of conversation sit
[41:55] in a barber shop
[41:56] and and and and so they were they were
[41:59] just you know
[41:59] going on about the political landscape
[42:02] and what we're looking at and
[42:03] and i tell you you know i i i even found
[42:06] myself sitting there saying
[42:07] my goodness what what might be about to
[42:10] happen because
[42:11] you know there are there are statements
[42:13] being made and on both sides all of them
[42:15] are making their statements and
[42:17] some of them are saying oh you know
[42:19] there's no evidence of this and the
[42:20] others are saying we got tons of
[42:22] evidence and
[42:22] you know i said well you'll have your
[42:24] day in court yeah we will have our day
[42:26] in court we'll find out you know
[42:27] and i sit there going my goodness wow am
[42:30] i ever glad i'm not
[42:32] living my life based on what this world
[42:35] is gonna you know they they figure that
[42:37] they can elect somebody and that's gonna
[42:38] solve all their problems and i'm already
[42:40] knowing it can't
[42:42] i'm already knowing that that that
[42:44] that's why i said to you on election day
[42:46] you know the day after i said i said my
[42:49] candidate won
[42:49] i voted for jesus and he voted for me
[42:53] and we both were elected to sit at a
[42:55] table thousands of miles long so i'm
[42:58] glad
[42:59] for that today i'm glad for the
[43:01] certainty of the word
[43:03] and you know it is a perplexing time i
[43:06] get it we're not
[43:08] you know making light you know men's
[43:09] hearts are indeed failing for fear
[43:12] we don't make light of that you know
[43:14] mankind is in a dark day and gross
[43:16] darkness is upon the people
[43:18] and so you know to me i'm not here to
[43:22] ridicule or make light or judge you know
[43:25] mankind humanity is in a sad state of
[43:27] affairs
[43:28] i you know i just say lord how can i
[43:31] help
[43:33] how can i help what good does it do me
[43:35] to tell them
[43:36] you know you got a problem if i don't
[43:38] have an answer
[43:40] and so you know i'd like to be able to
[43:42] walk up to a conversation
[43:44] and have an answer to say yeah you're
[43:46] right that's true that's going on this
[43:48] is real
[43:48] yeah that's not your imagination
[43:50] troubling times are everywhere but hey
[43:52] there is an answer to it and i happen to
[43:54] know what it is sit down and i'll tell
[43:56] you about it
[43:58] i'm glad for that friends i'm glad that
[44:00] we have not
[44:01] believed cunningly devised
[44:04] tales because you
[44:08] can be you can actually
[44:11] be in the truth and somewhere down the
[44:14] road
[44:15] the truth you started out with you end
[44:17] up in and it's just fables
[44:19] because it went off the rail you know
[44:21] and and very very often it's
[44:23] it's almost imperceptible in fact is in
[44:25] the scripture where it talks about
[44:27] people
[44:28] who were led you know led away from the
[44:30] truth and that's the sad part to me
[44:32] is that one time they were feasting on
[44:35] the truth and
[44:36] then you know it's turned into fables
[44:38] but actually if you look at the greek
[44:39] word
[44:41] between you know the greek word for
[44:43] fable is muthas
[44:44] and actually muthas and logos
[44:47] in the beginning mean the same thing
[44:49] they both mean word or thought expressed
[44:52] but then and when they're together
[44:54] they're in
[44:55] they're you know indistinguishable
[44:57] they're saying the same thing
[44:59] but a little ways downrange and and one
[45:03] starts to veer
[45:04] and you almost don't notice it and then
[45:06] a little further downrange it's a little
[45:08] more
[45:09] remember how brother bam talked about in
[45:10] target shooting and you're you're way up
[45:12] here
[45:13] you know with your rifle and your target
[45:15] is downrange 100
[45:16] you know meters or 200 meters and you
[45:19] know if you're
[45:20] if you're just a half an inch up here
[45:23] by the time that thing gets downrange
[45:25] you might not even hit the target at all
[45:26] you might hit a tree
[45:28] and so you know it that that's how it
[45:30] ends up you you start
[45:32] on the truth and then you allow a little
[45:34] bit of variation and a little bit
[45:36] and it doesn't seem like a lot at first
[45:39] people get trapped in that and they they
[45:42] start to
[45:43] dabble into a little bit of carnality
[45:45] it's not harmful it's
[45:46] so kind of okay it's not out and right
[45:49] sinful i know it's not exactly spiritual
[45:51] well i'm here to tell you something
[45:52] friends keep going and downrange
[45:55] it'll be into something very very
[45:58] unspiritual
[46:00] because the devil you know one of the
[46:02] things that
[46:03] that that that i suppose we could say
[46:06] at least one thing that god and the
[46:08] devil share
[46:09] as an objective is to not leave you
[46:13] how they find you amen
[46:16] and one moves you upward and one moves
[46:18] you downward but both of them
[46:20] have an aim to move you both of them
[46:23] you know one of them loves you too much
[46:26] to leave you like you are
[46:27] and one of them despises you too much to
[46:29] leave you like you are
[46:31] and i'm here to tell you something
[46:32] friends there's only those two powers
[46:34] you're either influenced from above
[46:36] or from beneath and the world is overran
[46:39] with influence from below and that's why
[46:42] there's chaos it's not a
[46:43] secret why there's chaos it's not a
[46:45] mystery
[46:46] why there's madness on the streets and
[46:48] turmoil in this
[46:50] you know in the very framework of the
[46:53] nation
[46:53] and not just this nation the whole world
[46:56] amen
[46:56] it's not a mystery because they for so
[47:00] long
[47:00] have rejected god's word and god's way
[47:03] of doing it
[47:04] it was inevitable
[47:07] that we arrive where we've arrived
[47:10] both the world and the bride because we
[47:15] literally the world has literally fed
[47:18] and eaten their way to where they are
[47:20] because you are what you eat you
[47:22] assimilate it what you feed on
[47:24] and the world you know has fed on the
[47:27] anti-word for so long
[47:29] that they literally have assimilated
[47:30] anti-word for so long they've become
[47:33] manifested anti-word and that's why
[47:36] you're different you're not different
[47:38] because you got a book of laws or codes
[47:40] or rules
[47:41] has zero to do with that you you cannot
[47:45] uh stick peacock feathers in the tail of
[47:48] a black bird and call him a peacock
[47:50] he's still a black blackbird you've got
[47:51] to have a complete nature change
[47:53] and then it has nothing to do with rules
[47:55] it has everything to do with
[47:57] love has everything to do with your
[48:00] heart's desire
[48:01] being changed brother branham says in
[48:03] the adoption series a lengthy series
[48:05] that he preached in 1960
[48:07] broke it into four lengthy parts but he
[48:10] makes this statement here
[48:12] and i'm going to come to this again on
[48:15] sunday perhaps not these exact quotes
[48:17] but
[48:17] moving from this direction he says now
[48:20] in genesis 2 when he made man
[48:23] so jehovah he says
[48:26] and now he starts talking about yahweh
[48:28] the the hebrew word i am
[48:30] uh yahoo of yahweh jehovah
[48:34] and he spells it out he says what did it
[48:36] mean here's what it means
[48:38] i am the all-existent one
[48:42] who created something off of myself see
[48:48] so so you you find you know that god
[48:52] how that he operated when he you know
[48:55] when he wanted to create
[48:57] fish he spoke to the sea
[49:00] amen when he wanted to create trees
[49:03] he spoke to the earth when he wanted to
[49:06] create man
[49:07] he turned to himself hallelujah
[49:11] you understand now he's going to bring
[49:13] something that is
[49:15] that is actually an expression of him
[49:18] he's going to he's going to extend
[49:22] or further himself into his creation
[49:25] it's all with a grand
[49:27] plan because he sees in his mind a whole
[49:30] economy
[49:31] a whole kingdom of saints a whole family
[49:35] governing a universe that defies
[49:41] even comprehending amen
[49:44] i sent a um a science article to brother
[49:47] mark here the other day
[49:49] and i said i said are you buckled up i
[49:52] said you're going to need to be because
[49:53] when i
[49:53] i read this it blew my mind i thought i
[49:56] was reading something wrong
[49:58] and uh when they literally now you know
[50:02] we talk about our milky way galaxy
[50:04] and you know how many some kid tell me
[50:06] how many planets we got
[50:08] well pluto got it taken out then it got
[50:10] put back in so
[50:11] it was a has been now it's a now it's a
[50:13] planet again and so you know you've got
[50:15] your
[50:16] mars and venus and earth and mercury and
[50:17] saturn and jupiter and pluto
[50:20] and uh maybe i'm forgetting one and yeah
[50:23] did that say mercury
[50:24] yeah okay now catch this you say
[50:27] wow you know we got a bunch of planets
[50:29] in the milky way and we know the milky
[50:31] way is one of the smallest galaxies
[50:33] well guess catch this now they have now
[50:35] discovered
[50:36] that just in our milky way i think the
[50:39] number was maybe
[50:40] 300 million earth-like planets
[50:45] in the milky way alone
[50:49] now we already know by science that
[50:51] there are more
[50:52] galaxies not planets galaxies
[50:56] there are more galaxies and here's one
[50:59] little one with 300 million planets
[51:02] there are more galaxies than all the
[51:05] grains of sand
[51:07] on all the beaches of the earth
[51:11] there's more galaxies that they can see
[51:15] than every grain of sand on all the
[51:18] beaches
[51:19] and this god back at the dawn before
[51:21] time even began
[51:23] created it spoke it and then
[51:27] conceived of a kingdom of saints
[51:30] that would that would be a an economy of
[51:33] god
[51:34] to say what are we going to do i don't
[51:36] know but i want to be there
[51:38] hallelujah you realize when you start
[51:41] thinking like that you start realizing
[51:43] how how insignificant you are and how
[51:46] little this
[51:46] little short vapor of a life really
[51:49] means
[51:50] i'm here to tell you something friends
[51:51] what are you living for and
[51:53] and i see people today and they're
[51:55] consumed
[51:56] they are consumed with the political
[51:59] landscape
[52:00] it's everything it's every waking moment
[52:02] and they're mad one minute and
[52:04] upset the next and mad again and upset
[52:06] the next and talk to one guy and they're
[52:08] ready to fight and talk to another guy
[52:09] and they're ready to have coffee
[52:10] and you know i mean my goodness i what a
[52:14] what a small life
[52:18] what a small life i my
[52:21] i i realized that that i i'm i'm
[52:24] did not just start here i'm not
[52:26] finishing here as i've said it so many
[52:28] times
[52:29] you know something friends uh god has a
[52:32] great plan
[52:33] and he has a family who he has given a
[52:37] mandate
[52:38] to declare that to the world
[52:42] that hey what you think about this life
[52:44] it ain't all that
[52:46] amen we have a mandate and we're the
[52:48] only ones who do only his family does
[52:51] every other voice trying to declare god
[52:54] is an illegitimate voice
[52:56] it is unauthorized it is illegitimate
[52:59] and it has no
[53:00] it has no because it doesn't speak by
[53:02] revelation
[53:03] the only one that can speak by
[53:05] revelation is somebody with a
[53:07] gene of almighty god and you're speaking
[53:10] from your gene pool you're speaking from
[53:12] experience
[53:12] you're speaking from nature
[53:16] and so we find here he says watch now
[53:18] watch this it's going to really
[53:20] bend your mind so here's the all
[53:24] existence one who has created something
[53:26] off of myself
[53:28] to be a son of mine or a temporary or
[53:31] amateur little one of mine glory why he
[53:34] gave
[53:34] man jehovah means he gave man
[53:39] to be an amateur god amen amen
[53:42] [Music]
[53:43] amen what because he is father god and
[53:46] he made a man an amateur god
[53:48] so he so he isn't self-existing
[53:52] anymore he exists with his family
[53:56] see and so jehovah meaning the one who
[53:59] exists
[54:00] with his family god made to be
[54:04] the predominant over all the earth he
[54:06] had dominion
[54:08] the earth was man's dominion is that
[54:10] scripture
[54:11] then if that's his dominion he was god
[54:13] over the earth he could speak it be
[54:15] so he could um uh
[54:18] whatever he would he would speak this
[54:20] and it would be so old there is god
[54:22] jehovah the one who once existed in
[54:24] self-existence
[54:25] but now exists with his family and his
[54:28] little ones with him
[54:29] he so he says there you are so so how
[54:32] did i get here
[54:33] that's the question how did i get you
[54:34] say well you know i was the son of
[54:37] of this man and this woman who were the
[54:39] sons of this man and this woman who were
[54:41] the sons
[54:42] you know and i would just simply say to
[54:43] you that is such a
[54:45] shallow understanding of how you got
[54:47] here and why you're here and what you do
[54:49] no wonder people don't catch what
[54:52] they're to be doing
[54:54] because they don't have a concept of
[54:55] even how they got here and they think i
[54:57] came here by natural procreation
[54:59] you're here because you were one of his
[55:01] little ones
[55:04] you were one of his little ones and i
[55:05] get that there's a whole creation of
[55:07] humanity
[55:08] and there are background players and god
[55:10] gives them all a chance for salvation
[55:11] but he has an elect family that is spun
[55:15] off of himself
[55:16] an expression of himself and he's making
[55:18] a declaration
[55:20] jesus made a declaration now you're
[55:22] making a declaration
[55:24] amen
[55:29] every day in your life when the world is
[55:31] in fear
[55:33] and you're not you're declaring
[55:36] amen every day when they are
[55:40] in despair but you've got faith you're
[55:43] declaring
[55:44] amen every day when they're angry and
[55:47] nasty
[55:48] and you're kind and pleasant you're
[55:50] declaring
[55:51] amen every day when they're having
[55:55] panic over wall street or
[55:58] panic over the congress or panic over
[56:01] some foreign nation
[56:02] and you know what while the world i
[56:05] don't i don't tell you some friends
[56:07] if if suddenly if suddenly we had a
[56:10] interruption you know what is that
[56:12] emergency broadcasting
[56:14] and all of a sudden you're listing or
[56:15] radio or watching
[56:18] this is an emergency broadcast and you
[56:21] know we have
[56:22] satellite confirmation that icbm
[56:24] missiles are headed toward america right
[56:26] now
[56:27] and they will be here in 12 minutes i
[56:28] would go wow 11 minutes to the rapture
[56:31] nice amen and the world be running
[56:34] around screaming we have 12 minutes to
[56:35] live i go no i got 11 minutes and i'm
[56:37] out of here
[56:38] hallelujah because i already know by a
[56:40] prophet before the first bomb ever falls
[56:42] i'm gone
[56:44] hallelujah friends say if they told me
[56:46] tomorrow this is what we can know by the
[56:48] word
[56:48] if they told me we have passed a law
[56:50] tomorrow and now
[56:52] the world council of churches is going
[56:54] to take over at noon
[56:55] tomorrow and you won't be able to buy or
[56:57] sell except you belong to the world
[56:59] council i'd say
[57:00] hey church we're going home tomorrow
[57:02] because i
[57:03] already know the bride don't see that
[57:05] fulfillment she's already gone in the
[57:07] rapture
[57:10] and and for this kind of thinking the
[57:12] world thinks you're crazy
[57:16] and and we think they're crazy
[57:21] and we kind of giggle and go yeah who's
[57:23] crazy now
[57:26] so we find out that there's such a
[57:28] contrast
[57:30] you know i i so appreciated
[57:33] some statements brother diggs made last
[57:36] time he was hearing we was talking about
[57:37] how that moses
[57:39] followed the teaching of his mother you
[57:41] know he chose that you remember that
[57:43] over egypt's teaching he had the wisdom
[57:46] of
[57:46] egypt in one ear and his mother and
[57:49] another ear but
[57:50] you're a special child you're chosen
[57:52] you're a deliverer
[57:53] and brother diggs brought out how that
[57:55] he followed
[57:57] he followed the teaching it's one thing
[58:00] to say this is what i believe well let
[58:01] me see what you do
[58:04] moses actually took footsteps and he put
[58:08] action so now when moses said you know
[58:10] when the bible says that he
[58:12] looked out upon him and you know he he
[58:14] counted the sufferings of christ of
[58:15] greater value than all the riches of
[58:17] egypt
[58:18] that wasn't just fancy words moses
[58:21] didn't just write that in some
[58:22] declaration
[58:23] moses life declared that
[58:27] he actually put took footsteps and
[58:29] actually moved out
[58:31] and actually intervened and tried to
[58:33] bring their freedom of course
[58:34] in a human way he couldn't do it and had
[58:36] to run
[58:37] for his life but but he was god's man
[58:39] and god got a hold of him and they got
[58:41] delivered
[58:43] see and so so we find out that that he
[58:46] followed the teaching of his mother over
[58:49] egypt over egypt's teaching because
[58:52] that's who he really was and that's what
[58:55] brother diggs was bringing out and so he
[58:57] says
[58:57] you know we couldn't abide you know uh
[59:00] you know the denominations of the world
[59:02] i
[59:02] i couldn't i couldn't abide a baptist
[59:04] lodge or a methodist lodge or a catholic
[59:06] lodge or upc lodge because that's not
[59:08] who i was
[59:09] why do you have to have the message
[59:10] because that's who i am is that because
[59:12] it's eagle food and i
[59:14] am an eagle and i'm sorry but i can't
[59:17] eat the
[59:18] carrion of the world and so you know he
[59:21] he he forsook all the comforts of egypt
[59:24] to suffer with christ
[59:25] and i here today i'm here to tell you
[59:28] that nobody
[59:29] makes me nobody denies me the comforts
[59:33] of laodicea i could have all of them
[59:35] that i want i have means and resources
[59:38] that i could i could tap into all the
[59:40] comforts but i don't want those comforts
[59:42] i choose nobody makes it makes me do it
[59:46] i choose to renounce the comforts of
[59:48] this life
[59:49] because i count the sufferings of christ
[59:51] to be of greater value
[59:54] say why do you do that are you crazy i'm
[59:57] crazy by the world standards
[59:59] because i don't think like them i don't
[1:00:02] act like them i don't want to act like
[1:00:04] them
[1:00:05] i don't react like them
[1:00:08] because it's almost always our reactions
[1:00:11] that get us in trouble more than our
[1:00:12] actions
[1:00:13] no one sets out no real christian
[1:00:17] gets up in the morning and go wow i
[1:00:20] think i'm going to go tie one on and sin
[1:00:22] and really have a you know really go off
[1:00:24] the rails today
[1:00:27] you know we don't determine that action
[1:00:29] but a lot of times the devil comes in
[1:00:31] sets something there's a certain contact
[1:00:33] a certain thing you hear it you see it
[1:00:36] you're right there and now what is your
[1:00:38] reaction to it
[1:00:40] amen see and so brother branham says
[1:00:43] here
[1:00:44] in the uh in the in the fourth seal and
[1:00:47] i
[1:00:48] i uh where he talks about how that he
[1:00:51] says you know in the third seal we had
[1:00:53] him
[1:00:53] we had him coming last night let me
[1:00:55] catch it he says now we had him coming
[1:00:58] last night that was in the third seal
[1:00:59] this is now in the fourth seal
[1:01:01] he said we had him coming last night
[1:01:03] with his great sword to kill
[1:01:05] we find out that he gets killed with the
[1:01:07] sword too the sword
[1:01:09] of the word i'm going to large on that
[1:01:11] sunday i don't want to go too deep into
[1:01:12] it tonight
[1:01:13] but god's word sharp two-edged sword
[1:01:17] remember that it's a two-edged sword all
[1:01:19] right
[1:01:20] slays him that's the devil puts him
[1:01:23] right down
[1:01:24] and he says wait to them seven thunders
[1:01:27] utter their voices to that group
[1:01:30] who really can take the word of god and
[1:01:33] hand it there now
[1:01:34] this goes a little bit into the ministry
[1:01:36] of moses and elijah because he says
[1:01:38] it'll slice and cut and they can close
[1:01:40] the heavens and they can do this
[1:01:41] whatever they want
[1:01:42] and when he gets to the sixth seal he
[1:01:44] makes it clear that that's the ministry
[1:01:46] of moses and elijah which we're not here
[1:01:47] for
[1:01:48] so so don't don't mix up our ministry
[1:01:51] with their ministry
[1:01:52] okay i'm just just making that point but
[1:01:54] but there is a group
[1:01:56] who are here now when the seventh under
[1:01:59] mystery out of the seals is being made
[1:02:01] known
[1:02:02] it is being declared say oh is it is it
[1:02:05] some
[1:02:05] some lesson some sermon some great bible
[1:02:08] teachers teaching it
[1:02:09] no it's being declared behind skin the
[1:02:12] seven thunder mystery is being declared
[1:02:14] in people
[1:02:16] and that's what makes it undeniable
[1:02:18] because you can argue it and debate
[1:02:20] theology but you cannot debate you
[1:02:23] cannot argue against the literal life of
[1:02:26] almighty god
[1:02:27] you might not want it but you can't
[1:02:29] defeat it
[1:02:31] because the life proves what it is even
[1:02:34] the devil that's
[1:02:36] that's it i've said this before it must
[1:02:39] be terribly
[1:02:41] perplexing to the devil that the more
[1:02:44] trials he puts on you the stronger you
[1:02:47] get
[1:02:50] and the more sorrow and sadness he hits
[1:02:52] you with
[1:02:53] the greater your faith i mean can you
[1:02:56] imagine trying to plan for that
[1:03:00] can you imagine that you're the you're
[1:03:02] the devil and you've got to go
[1:03:04] how can i get this person you know to
[1:03:08] to renounce god i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:03:10] torture him
[1:03:11] and the more he pours it on the higher
[1:03:14] the more they praise god
[1:03:16] and then he backs off and god blesses
[1:03:18] them he says well let's do the opposite
[1:03:20] let's let them get a blessing
[1:03:22] and then they get a blessing and then
[1:03:23] they realize that's god and then they
[1:03:25] rejoice in that as well i'm here to tell
[1:03:27] you some friends
[1:03:28] the devil could actually win if it
[1:03:30] wasn't for losing
[1:03:32] and that's the old statement you can't
[1:03:34] win for losing and i say you could
[1:03:36] actually win oh boy if you weren't
[1:03:37] losing
[1:03:38] but guess what he's losing on me he's
[1:03:40] losing on you because god's already won
[1:03:42] i've already made my decision
[1:03:44] god's already made his decision my life
[1:03:47] is here to be a declaration of this word
[1:03:50] and i'm not interested in declaring
[1:03:54] for hollywood i'm not interested in
[1:03:56] being a billboard for them
[1:03:58] i'm not interested in being a billboard
[1:04:00] for for
[1:04:01] uh spoiled rich ballplayers i'm not
[1:04:04] interested in being a billboard for them
[1:04:05] i'd like to be a billboard for the word
[1:04:07] of god
[1:04:08] i'd like for people to see that
[1:04:10] something is real and it's not just
[1:04:12] a it's not just a testimony from the
[1:04:14] mouth all right go to this church i
[1:04:15] belong to that church i've done this
[1:04:17] i've done that
[1:04:17] i'd you shouldn't even have to open your
[1:04:19] mouth your whole life
[1:04:21] should be a declaration of god
[1:04:26] i was thinking you know and brother
[1:04:27] branham says here he says now this group
[1:04:30] that can handle it i love the fact that
[1:04:32] he said it that way
[1:04:34] who can really take the word of god and
[1:04:36] hand it there not handle it
[1:04:40] in other words you know let me give it
[1:04:41] to you like this the other day brother
[1:04:42] mark came to my house and he was
[1:04:44] installing something for
[1:04:45] sister debbie and she broke her lazy
[1:04:48] susan and
[1:04:50] i said honey you can't pow you know 9
[1:04:53] 000 cans on the back of it
[1:04:55] you got to distribute out she said but
[1:04:56] then we figured out it was 20 years old
[1:04:58] and so
[1:04:58] she deserved to break it and get a new
[1:04:59] one so brother mark is there
[1:05:02] and he come quickly and he brought a
[1:05:04] drill but it was the wrong one a little
[1:05:05] impact drill and he
[1:05:06] he needed a big house of a nice drill we
[1:05:08] were gonna drill and we're gonna put
[1:05:09] some piece of trims up and i said hey
[1:05:10] you want to drill it he goes
[1:05:11] yeah all i got is i said oh i got a
[1:05:13] drill and so i go out to my
[1:05:15] i have so many things that i probably
[1:05:16] never use except when somebody comes
[1:05:18] that knows how to use them
[1:05:20] and so i go out there and i get my drill
[1:05:22] and i bring it in and i open up and
[1:05:23] brother mark takes it in his hand
[1:05:25] now here's a real craftsman here's a man
[1:05:27] who knows this tool
[1:05:28] to me it's yellow it goes around and
[1:05:30] around you can you can tighten it's a
[1:05:33] screw or a screwdriver or drill into it
[1:05:35] and drill something if your fingers out
[1:05:37] of the way
[1:05:38] and brother mark holds that up and he
[1:05:39] goes whoa dewalt
[1:05:41] and i'm like yeah
[1:05:44] that's right is that good oh yeah oh
[1:05:48] yeah that's right yeah i know it's good
[1:05:51] and i just thought you know what it what
[1:05:53] it means to be the right kind of tool
[1:05:56] in the hand of a man who knows how to
[1:05:58] use it i felt glad that i wasn't
[1:06:00] bringing some chintzy little
[1:06:02] chinese-made
[1:06:03] toy you know i was bringing him a drill
[1:06:06] he recognized the name he recognized it
[1:06:08] took he fit his hand
[1:06:09] he it did the job and i just thought
[1:06:12] here's
[1:06:12] here's people who are going to be here
[1:06:14] in the earth imagine how much
[1:06:16] pleasure god takes in the fact that i
[1:06:19] know i got some tools
[1:06:21] down there and they'll get in my hand
[1:06:23] and they'll do the job
[1:06:24] it's not it's not something cheap it's
[1:06:26] not somebody flim-flam up and down in
[1:06:28] and out wishy-washy
[1:06:30] i got a family and they're and they're
[1:06:32] quality
[1:06:33] family and they're a tool how many want
[1:06:35] to be a tool
[1:06:36] in the hand of the lord
[1:06:40] to be something of value to him
[1:06:44] brother branham says here in the message
[1:06:46] lean not to thy own understanding
[1:06:52] now watch this i'm going to come down to
[1:06:54] where we live
[1:06:56] can we go there you're not afraid of the
[1:06:59] word are you
[1:07:02] watch this brother branham says
[1:07:06] he says i think it would be a good
[1:07:09] exhortation today
[1:07:12] if we said to our sons and to
[1:07:15] to the sons of god that it's all right
[1:07:19] to have an education
[1:07:22] there is nothing against that amen
[1:07:27] but when now watch but when that
[1:07:30] education is contrary to the word
[1:07:33] here's a prophet's advice then
[1:07:36] lean to the word and let your education
[1:07:40] go
[1:07:42] that's simple see
[1:07:46] because the word see and education will
[1:07:49] stand
[1:07:50] now watch this now watch this here's a
[1:07:52] here is a reasonable man
[1:07:54] who's a human being lives in the world
[1:07:56] understands what it means to live
[1:07:59] he says education will stand
[1:08:04] and will give you a good job probably a
[1:08:07] good standing
[1:08:08] amongst intellectual people and that's
[1:08:11] all right
[1:08:11] see which will probably be a great
[1:08:14] help to you in your financial
[1:08:18] and your livelihood make a living maybe
[1:08:21] a little better for you
[1:08:24] but remember one thing
[1:08:31] ready you ready
[1:08:35] education is fine it can help you
[1:08:39] make a good living for you no problem
[1:08:42] but remember one thing my son
[1:08:47] you've got to die amen no matter how
[1:08:50] much
[1:08:51] education you've got how much culture
[1:08:54] you're able to accumulate you've yet
[1:08:58] got to face death because it's written
[1:09:01] that men must die and
[1:09:02] after that the judgment and watch what
[1:09:06] he says here
[1:09:07] now death is not so bad but coming to
[1:09:10] the judgment
[1:09:11] that's the bad part see now
[1:09:15] you can die but after that the judgment
[1:09:17] now watch this
[1:09:20] god is not going to inquire of you
[1:09:23] how much schooling you got when you were
[1:09:26] here on earth
[1:09:30] watch how much knowledge you accumulated
[1:09:36] whether you got your bachelor of art or
[1:09:39] whatever degree you might have been
[1:09:41] even as a minister it's not going to be
[1:09:44] required of you
[1:09:45] at the judgment all right but it's going
[1:09:48] to be required of you
[1:09:50] hear it hear it ready it's going to be
[1:09:54] required of you
[1:09:55] what you did about the understanding of
[1:09:59] god's word
[1:10:00] amen now you're talking about a prophet
[1:10:04] now who's
[1:10:04] zeroing down on what really matters
[1:10:09] get a bachelor of art have an education
[1:10:11] that's great it could help you make a
[1:10:12] better livelihood
[1:10:13] living for you puts you in elite company
[1:10:16] can help you in life
[1:10:18] but remember one thing we remember
[1:10:21] you still got to die and after the death
[1:10:23] the judgment
[1:10:25] see so he says
[1:10:28] none of that's going to be required of
[1:10:30] you what's going to be required of you
[1:10:31] is what did you
[1:10:32] what you did about the understanding of
[1:10:34] god's word that's
[1:10:36] where here's a prophet that's where the
[1:10:39] requirement
[1:10:40] comes because of that your education is
[1:10:44] fine amen now watch this ready
[1:10:47] your education is fine
[1:10:50] but the word of god is life
[1:10:55] that's a big jump that's a big
[1:10:59] jump education is fine
[1:11:02] so no no problem say what about
[1:11:05] education it's fine
[1:11:08] but the word of god is eternal life
[1:11:11] that's like grand canyon style
[1:11:15] difference yes amen see
[1:11:18] and so he says
[1:11:22] my word is life and to know it is life
[1:11:25] and he said
[1:11:26] to know him because he is the word now
[1:11:28] we
[1:11:29] find the results of this watch now watch
[1:11:31] the pursuit of education in the world
[1:11:34] it plunged the whole human race to death
[1:11:37] because
[1:11:37] the first mother on the earth leaned
[1:11:40] to her own understanding contrary to the
[1:11:44] word of god
[1:11:45] and it plunged the whole human race to
[1:11:48] death
[1:11:50] now do you believe that
[1:11:58] that's the word see so
[1:12:01] a church today can accept a bunch of
[1:12:04] dogmas and creeds
[1:12:05] and plunge the whole congregation in a
[1:12:08] separation from god
[1:12:10] those people who adopt those things in
[1:12:12] the stead of the word of god
[1:12:14] are just like eve it's
[1:12:18] here's a statement he makes it's been
[1:12:19] done over and over
[1:12:21] till it's got this whole generation
[1:12:24] plunged away from the word of god
[1:12:26] so now we're back now we've come full
[1:12:28] circle why do we see the madness
[1:12:32] why is there such social turmoil
[1:12:34] political turmoil
[1:12:36] national turmoil global turmoil
[1:12:39] there and and and here's the simple
[1:12:42] answer
[1:12:42] has it been here's a here's a fair
[1:12:45] question maybe they haven't heard
[1:12:47] and the prophet says oh no no no their
[1:12:50] sound went into all the earth
[1:12:52] god has circled the globe and is
[1:12:56] circling the globe
[1:12:57] right now on every
[1:13:00] medium and every in every format into
[1:13:02] all the jungles
[1:13:03] all the most remote parts of the earth
[1:13:05] and that's where jesus
[1:13:07] said it would be that way that that that
[1:13:08] the gospel that he was standing there
[1:13:10] declaring
[1:13:11] that there would be a declaration in all
[1:13:13] the world and then the end would come
[1:13:15] amen so have they not heard yea
[1:13:18] the prophet said oh they've heard their
[1:13:20] sound went into all the earth
[1:13:22] see but what we find is is that
[1:13:26] when they were presented with the word
[1:13:27] of god they made a choice that eve made
[1:13:30] they leaned
[1:13:31] to their own understanding amen
[1:13:35] and it literally here's what he said now
[1:13:37] and this is amazing because this is 1965
[1:13:40] cub scout days
[1:13:42] see it it it
[1:13:45] until it's got the whole generation
[1:13:48] plunged away from the word of god there
[1:13:51] was one man watch this there was one man
[1:13:52] who did lead to his own understanding
[1:13:54] his name was judas iscariot
[1:13:56] brother brown says i don't see how he
[1:13:58] could have done it
[1:14:00] amen he walked face to face with christ
[1:14:03] just like eve did in the beginning
[1:14:04] he seen the vindication he looked at god
[1:14:06] in the face like eve did in the cool of
[1:14:08] the evening
[1:14:09] he even he eve looked at christ in the
[1:14:12] cool of the evening in the garden
[1:14:13] and judas had sat in the cool of the
[1:14:15] evening in the garden of gethsemane in
[1:14:17] many places he looked at the same christ
[1:14:19] and heard him teach proved himself by
[1:14:22] the word
[1:14:22] vindicated to be a prophet that moses
[1:14:24] had spoke would raise up
[1:14:26] and told them in the scripture who he
[1:14:27] was and all about it
[1:14:29] they had seen it proved by god that he
[1:14:31] was
[1:14:32] and then he leaned to his own
[1:14:33] understanding now here we are friends
[1:14:35] eve
[1:14:36] lee uh saw it and made a decision when
[1:14:39] christ was visible in the evening time
[1:14:42] judas
[1:14:43] saw christ in the evening time and it
[1:14:45] became very visible and there's we made
[1:14:47] his choice and you're here today
[1:14:49] and you're back to the evening time of
[1:14:51] the history of mankind
[1:14:52] and i'm here to tell you christ is
[1:14:54] visible among us
[1:14:56] his word is plain it's pure it's in your
[1:14:58] face
[1:14:59] where you've got a whole family of god
[1:15:01] declaring it to be so
[1:15:04] amen so what are you what's your
[1:15:07] decision
[1:15:09] because depending on the decision you
[1:15:13] make
[1:15:14] it'll plunge you into chaos or take you
[1:15:16] into glory
[1:15:18] amen and you don't get a greater
[1:15:21] contradistinction
[1:15:23] than between heaven and hell amen
[1:15:28] how could he do it see
[1:15:31] watch how could he do it
[1:15:34] brother brown lays out the case when he
[1:15:36] was there and he saw him and he fell
[1:15:38] to believe and saw him in the face and
[1:15:39] saw him saw the miracles and he knew the
[1:15:41] word and all of this thing
[1:15:42] here's here's the answer he's going to
[1:15:44] answer his own question see
[1:15:46] how could he do it he didn't know
[1:15:49] in the scripture that he had raised up
[1:15:54] to take that same place
[1:15:57] that the scripture had foretold about
[1:15:59] him
[1:16:00] see and neither does the people today
[1:16:03] realize what condition they are in
[1:16:06] it's ordained for this laodicea church
[1:16:09] to be
[1:16:10] in this condition putting christ on the
[1:16:13] outside
[1:16:14] and him knocking trying to get back in
[1:16:17] no cooperation
[1:16:18] nowhere though see so it was prophesied
[1:16:22] you know two millennia what we would see
[1:16:26] today said what did it say about today
[1:16:29] that christ would be put out of the
[1:16:30] church
[1:16:31] amen that that that he would become
[1:16:34] obviously declared to the people the
[1:16:36] seven seals would be open
[1:16:38] a prophet would be standing on the earth
[1:16:40] they couldn't deny it
[1:16:41] brother branham challenged him you're
[1:16:43] afraid of that light that light
[1:16:45] showed before the world the cameras took
[1:16:47] pictures of it
[1:16:48] a prophet had it all in tens and tens of
[1:16:50] thousands of times
[1:16:53] they're not the world's not innocent you
[1:16:55] could we can feel sorry for them we do
[1:16:57] feel it's a great tragedy
[1:16:59] i feel sorry for mankind and and and
[1:17:02] it doesn't make me go it makes me go
[1:17:05] lord
[1:17:06] give me feeling of responsibility
[1:17:09] increase it upon me that i can be a
[1:17:11] brighter light somehow
[1:17:13] that i can declare him more brightly
[1:17:15] more vividly
[1:17:16] maybe they haven't seen enough example
[1:17:21] of the true word of god
[1:17:25] but they put him out you know
[1:17:29] i was thinking about the social upheaval
[1:17:32] we see in the streets today
[1:17:35] national turmoil and strife and they're
[1:17:38] saying that within just the next couple
[1:17:40] of weeks
[1:17:40] things could go sideways real bad
[1:17:45] real bad i mean you know
[1:17:48] you you've got you've got one side
[1:17:50] saying
[1:17:51] and you know i always during this time
[1:17:53] and and it's unavoidable the topic's
[1:17:55] unavoidable because
[1:17:56] we're at the end time and that's part of
[1:17:58] it so i'm constantly feeling like i have
[1:18:01] to
[1:18:01] have a disclaimer to go i'm neither one
[1:18:04] can i talk about it without you
[1:18:06] thinking i'm taking either side because
[1:18:09] i'm not either one i'm a christian
[1:18:13] but what you see happening is not an
[1:18:15] accident
[1:18:16] say who's going to get inaugurated in
[1:18:18] january i don't know
[1:18:20] i don't know you got one side saying
[1:18:23] oh we've already got it we've got the
[1:18:25] votes we're going to do it and you've
[1:18:26] got another side saying
[1:18:27] we're going to get that negated and it's
[1:18:29] going to be overturned
[1:18:30] and they're going to well you've got no
[1:18:31] evidence they're going to we got lots of
[1:18:32] evidence and y'all are going to all be
[1:18:34] in jail
[1:18:34] and it's it's such a such a din
[1:18:38] you hardly know what to believe and and
[1:18:40] you know what i just simply
[1:18:41] sometimes i just close my eyes and go
[1:18:43] thank god you're in control lord
[1:18:45] oh i'm so glad you're in control oh
[1:18:48] because the madness is maddening
[1:18:50] and and the voices and they're all back
[1:18:52] and forth and all a bunch of talking
[1:18:54] heads
[1:18:54] and you know if we're not careful now
[1:18:56] this is something that i thought it was
[1:18:57] kind of amusing to me as i thought about
[1:18:59] it
[1:19:00] and i thought you know i get it
[1:19:03] i mean i get the whole thing of that
[1:19:05] sure
[1:19:06] i'm i would never even if i wasn't a
[1:19:09] christian
[1:19:10] i could never vote for partial birth
[1:19:12] abortion
[1:19:13] i could never vote for anyone who stands
[1:19:15] for that i could not i mean they're
[1:19:16] talking about babies that come to term
[1:19:18] and are born and they kill them
[1:19:20] and i and and and no wonder brother
[1:19:23] branham talks about
[1:19:24] that that party uh sold their birthright
[1:19:28] when they elected the first catholic
[1:19:30] president back in the 60s
[1:19:33] and you know that brother branham in in
[1:19:35] 33 years of ministry
[1:19:37] so every four years he would have got to
[1:19:39] vote what about seven or six or seven
[1:19:42] eight about eight different times in his
[1:19:44] life
[1:19:45] and out of 33 years of opportunity he
[1:19:48] voted once
[1:19:50] to me that is so amazing
[1:19:53] because which one did the lord have him
[1:19:56] go vote for
[1:19:57] he comes down to a president where
[1:19:59] they're going to elect a catholic
[1:20:02] and god sends elijah to the
[1:20:05] po to the voting booth and elijah votes
[1:20:09] against that the only time he ever voted
[1:20:12] but it's as if god was saying i'm going
[1:20:15] to
[1:20:16] i'm going to show the world a sign i'm
[1:20:18] going to take my prophet
[1:20:19] and i'm going to have him now the whole
[1:20:21] world should follow him
[1:20:23] and whoever he votes for should win the
[1:20:25] election by a hundred percent
[1:20:28] and he shouldn't he should win 100 to
[1:20:29] zero because that's my prophet
[1:20:32] how many believe he was and
[1:20:36] here he sends his prophet to vote for
[1:20:38] the one
[1:20:39] that the whole world should have

[1:22:57] and he thought he heard something he
[1:22:58] said what was that must have just been
[1:23:00] me and he started mowing his grass again
