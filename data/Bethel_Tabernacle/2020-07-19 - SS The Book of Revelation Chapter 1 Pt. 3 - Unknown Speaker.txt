TRANSCRIPT
========================================
word creation but he's more than Adam because now and the second item is a further because now he's he's the begotten the only begotten in other words a spoken word man born of a woman and the the only next and most obvious step that he would take as you can imagine and it's what he did is to then take the next obvious step and come down and live inside of people who are also born of a woman but born by sin and convert that child by a new birth and bring them back to the image of the word that they were originally intended to come by hallelujah and the last element of that as Paul would say is the change of our mortal bodies and then we will have a body likened unto his glorious or glorified body amen all right line one of my notes for today so it's it's I I will I will of necessity not move beyond revelation 1:1 for a while because it is the key to unlocking it will give you context to understand as you read the symbolism you'll need to understand everything I'm saying now in order for it to make sense or you'll end up as as brother Jose pastors fond of saying you'll end up with your cow your painting will be a cow standing in the top of the tree drinking coca-cola and so I laugh at uncle to him every time he says that so it's his it's his Louisiana spin on that a man but it certainly is accurate so so the life now so there now you can imagine alright wait I'm going to take my last some minutes here I'm not that clock there's a little slow so it's gonna need bumped up about two minutes brother Luther said it just at about 11 minutes till sorry my OCD won't let me see that be a minute and a half off like that amen sorry sorry buddy thank you I feel much better now so so we find that that that the life of Christ as it's unfolding to us it one of the first things that one of the first benefits that you can enjoy that the last age true church is going to need is that the life of Christ was was not to cause us to go on saying you know look at brother Branham look at brother Branham one of the one of the liberating things is is that we realized that that's not the concept that the message he brought was the final message and there's no other message coming it is our absolute on the scriptures because everything's got to tie back to the scriptures with understanding because the problem that the last day faced was that the traditions of man had taken us completely away from Christ not the historical figure but who he was and they turned him into a second of a three-person Godhead they butchered up the baptism found that the church was baptizing contrary to the original Church and so this revelation had to come to bring us back and place us back in the scripture so that we begin to understand what we're supposed to be or as Malachi 4 says it would take us back to the faith of the fathers or take us back to the gospel that Paul preached now if that's not true if that's not true then why do we have thousands of Christian denominations today and an additional tens of thousands of variable subsets of those denominations how would God manage to take a bride from that kind of a quagmire of man-made religion and do it fairly how would he take out of that kind of a meir 10,000 or more recorded denominations that the government recognizes and probably another 10 to 20,000 subsets beyond that how would God take a bride from that quagmire of man-made religion and do it fairly the obvious answer is then found in his own promise that when this gospel is preached in all the earth then the end would come when this gospel brother Jesus was saying this current gospel we we find that it would take that current gospel not 10000 denominational opinions on it and another 20,000 sub denominational opinions and all of these various movements and God would judge Jesus prophesied that as the Lightning comes out of the east and shines to the west so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man so he his he answers the question for us today how would God take a bride out of this quagmire he would restore the original truth and that was his promise it's the obvious answer it's the only answer that he could that hid that would that there is where God could do it fairly he could raise a standard of the Word of God in this last day and a standard in battle when a standard is raised it's raised so the people can gather so that they in a battle in in the fog of war a standard is so that all the troops know where they're supposed to be and everybody can get in their position and if you're trying to fight in his army and you've got a misunderstanding of baptism or misunderstanding of who Christ was and his relationship to the Father which if you don't understand who he was as a human and his relationship to the Father then you can never understand as a human your relationship to the Father so then there is so so the first necessary element is that he restore back that first original gospel with its original teaching and accuracy and then you know then there is the choosing of that perfect time in an age when there are sufficient resources to propagate it around the world the nation you live in is not an accident it was not blessed to have the the the the highest rate of ability to propagate when when that gospel was restored God would need this western country to propagate it around the world so it's not about that that we were better people than anyone else it was that we fit into the vision of God's plan god bless you that's all the time we have for today god bless you service will begin after a five to ten minute intermission god bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
