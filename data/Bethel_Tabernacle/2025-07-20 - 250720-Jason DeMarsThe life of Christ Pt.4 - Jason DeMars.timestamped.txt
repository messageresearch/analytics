[0:00] As we read the scripture,
[0:04] Ephesians chapter 4 and
[0:09] verse 30.
[0:12] And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[0:14] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[0:18] redemption.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; Let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[0:24] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[0:27] from you with all malice. Heavenly
[0:29] Father, we just want to commit this time
[0:31] to you, Lord. We ask that your Holy
[0:33] Spirit would come and take your word and
[0:35] write it upon your people's hearts.
[0:37] Lord, we we know our own weaknesses,
[0:40] Lord, our own faults, our own failures,
[0:43] the way we the ways we come up short.
[0:45] And we understand, Lord, that it is a
[0:48] treasure that is in earthn vessels,
[0:50] Lord. And so, we're looking to you, the
[0:52] spirit of God dwelling within us to to
[0:54] do all the good things, Lord, in our
[0:57] hearts. And so we pray that you'd write
[0:59] this word there and that because you
[1:01] wrote it there that it would change us
[1:03] and make us more like Jesus Christ. We
[1:04] commit ourselves to you in Jesus name.
[1:07] Amen. Be seated. God bless you.
[1:11] So we were speaking about uh bitterness
[1:14] before.
[1:16] And of course we understand we look at
[1:18] the scripture it says grieve not the
[1:21] Holy Spirit of God whereby we ye are
[1:24] sealed unto the day of redemption.
[1:27] And of course, we don't want to grieve
[1:28] the Holy Spirit. But how do we grieve
[1:30] the Holy Spirit? It's shows us in the
[1:33] following verse. Bitterness, wrath,
[1:36] anger, clamor, evil speaking. These are
[1:39] ways that we actually grieve the spirit
[1:42] of God.
[1:44] In we say away from us, but we
[1:46] understand we're sealed until the day of
[1:48] redemption. So it's not that we the Holy
[1:51] Spirit leaves leaves us but more like
[1:55] the influence of the Holy Spirit will
[1:58] fall into the background not even that
[2:00] the Holy Spirit will not be there to
[2:03] influence influence us subtly but when
[2:06] we engage in these things what ends up
[2:09] happening is the Holy Spirit just takes
[2:11] the back seat instead of instead of
[2:14] having preeminence through bitterness
[2:16] through wrath through anger clamor
[2:18] people speaking, the Holy Spirit
[2:20] actually takes second place.
[2:23] Not because he is second place, but
[2:25] because we have put him in second place
[2:28] &gt;&gt; or last place or however you want to put
[2:30] it. So, we look at these verses. I like
[2:33] to look at the NLT to get a different uh
[2:36] take on the interpretation of these
[2:39] different um descriptive words.
[2:41] Bitterness,
[2:43] it says wrath, right? So rage. So
[2:46] something more than anger
[2:49] uh a rage, anger, harsh words and
[2:55] slander.
[2:56] So we we look at this and we spoke
[2:58] before about bitterness taking a root
[3:00] and then it growing and producing fruit,
[3:03] being in the right conditions and it
[3:05] grows and produces fruit. And so as I
[3:08] look at this, you see that many times
[3:10] bitterness, the fruit of bitterness is
[3:15] varying levels of this. And I think as
[3:18] you'll see when we read in the next
[3:20] verse, another another thing is
[3:22] strongholds.
[3:24] Uh those those are things that actually
[3:27] also that's like the other side of it.
[3:29] On the one hand, you have someone that
[3:31] just blows up. They have bitterness and
[3:32] they just let it all out and they blow
[3:35] up. That's not good.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; But in some ways, it's better than the
[3:39] alternative. The alternative is just to
[3:41] shut down. You build a stronghold.
[3:44] &gt;&gt; For the weapons of our warfare are not
[3:46] carnal, but mighty through God to the
[3:49] pulling down of strongholds,
[3:51] casting down imaginations and every high
[3:53] thing that exalts itself against the
[3:55] knowledge of God and bringing into
[3:57] captivity every thought to the obedience
[4:00] of Christ. And so in our in our thought
[4:02] life, we can get stuck there.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. and through our imag. It's not
[4:07] wrong to have imaginations.
[4:09] God God even works through our
[4:12] imaginations when the word of God has
[4:14] preeminence. But when we are stuck in
[4:17] our own thinking, our own way of
[4:20] approaching things, our own imaginations
[4:23] about situations, about the word of God,
[4:26] about things in life, we're stuck there.
[4:29] And what that's usually the source of
[4:32] bitterness is we faced a problem with a
[4:35] person or a group of people and instead
[4:39] of instead of facing it, we come to we
[4:42] use our imagination to to come to many
[4:45] different conclusions about the motive
[4:47] behind it, the idea behind it, why it
[4:50] was done. And what ends up happening is
[4:53] you create a stronghold around that
[4:57] thought, around that attitude, around
[5:01] that bitterness. And so in order to
[5:03] protect yourself from the ramifications
[5:05] of your bitterness, which would be
[5:07] normally be anger and rage and so forth,
[5:11] I'm very spiritual. So, I'm going to get
[5:14] bricks and mortar and start building
[5:17] &gt;&gt; a wall around my heart to keep between
[5:21] myself and other people. And these are
[5:25] the things that will end up exalting
[5:27] itself against the knowledge of God. And
[5:29] it doesn't just have ramifications in
[5:32] relationships to other people. That's
[5:34] bad enough. What it ends up happening is
[5:36] it it turns into a ramification
[5:39] of how you respond actually to the word
[5:42] of God preached before you. You build
[5:45] that stronghold so that God and our
[5:47] people can get near your heart. And that
[5:50] that that is
[5:52] both are dangerous because on the one
[5:54] hand you blow up and you can assault
[5:56] someone or you can insult someone or you
[5:59] can even end up killing people.
[6:02] It's it's that side of is a lack of
[6:05] self-control and the other side is when
[6:07] you want to engage in excessive
[6:10] self-control that you try to bury how
[6:13] you feel about something and what ends
[6:14] up happening is you build build a wall
[6:17] around your heart and it's really not
[6:20] disguising
[6:22] everything disguising it because people
[6:24] don't know but they're going to look at
[6:26] it and say what's going on with them.
[6:28] They've withdrawn themselves. They don't
[6:30] want to talk. they don't want to
[6:31] interact and
[6:34] that's probably the
[6:36] uh you know the first thing I spoke
[6:39] about happens from time to time but the
[6:41] big thing with people who are Christians
[6:43] they build strongholds
[6:45] they remove themselves they check out
[6:47] they don't want anything to do with
[6:49] people and they can stay really
[6:51] religious at the same time and it's a
[6:54] danger because what it does is you will
[6:57] never bring every thought to obedience
[6:59] to Christ because you have a little box
[7:02] that you've portioned off and sealed off
[7:04] from the outside world and God nor man
[7:06] can go go near it. And the only antidote
[7:10] to that is just facing it
[7:13] first. You have to let go yourself and
[7:15] deal with it yourself and go before God
[7:17] and get rid of the you might be right to
[7:20] be angry. You might be right
[7:23] &gt;&gt; to be upset about it, but at the same
[7:25] time to hold it inside and not confront
[7:29] it and forgive, you're cutting yourself
[7:32] off
[7:33] &gt;&gt; from God.
[7:37] So then the antidote scripture speaks
[7:40] about is Ephesians 4:32, which is right
[7:43] after the verses we just read about
[7:45] grieving the Holy Spirit and let
[7:47] bitterness depart from us. Be kind one
[7:51] to another,
[7:53] tender-hearted, forgiving one another,
[7:55] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[7:57] forgiven you.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; And of course, we understand that if we
[8:01] if we won't forgive, there's one
[8:03] condition as Christians,
[8:06] it's if we forgive. If we don't forgive
[8:09] people who have wronged us, your
[8:11] heavenly father will not forgive you.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we will cut ourselves off
[8:17] ultimately from the grace of God by
[8:19] holding unforgiveness in our hearts. And
[8:22] and again we this is this is like a side
[8:26] topic but many times forgiveness
[8:29] you may not feel it initially. You may
[8:31] not feel it for a long time but if you
[8:34] keep confessing that forgiveness the
[8:36] Holy Spirit will help you release the
[8:39] feeling feelings that you have. But if
[8:42] you refuse to confess forgiveness
[8:46] or do the action of forgiveness, that's
[8:48] where the stronghold gets built up and
[8:51] bitterness comes forth. And really what
[8:54] it is is is putting on an outward mask
[8:56] of obedience,
[8:58] assuring ourselves of our own safety
[9:01] without actually having the fruit of the
[9:02] spirit and the work of love on display
[9:06] in our lives. It's in fact it ends up
[9:09] having the quite quite the opposite.
[9:11] It's a great hindrance to the spirit of
[9:13] God working and flowing through us. And
[9:15] if we don't see our own weakness in this
[9:18] area, uh
[9:21] we have a problem
[9:24] &gt;&gt; because this is this is an area that any
[9:27] one of us can get going down the road
[9:30] the wrong one of the two wrong roads.
[9:32] The right road is forgiveness and
[9:35] releasing.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[9:39] The wrong road is uh bitterness that
[9:43] results in rage or bitterness that
[9:45] results in a stronghold. Both of those
[9:48] things have to be we have to surrender
[9:50] that to the Lord. We have to do the the
[9:52] hard hard work of love and forgiveness.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; That's the hardest thing.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; The easy thing that our flesh wants to
[9:59] do is to do those two things.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; And
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; But the results aren't easy.
[10:09] forgiveness and love, the results, it
[10:12] the work is hard, the results are easy.
[10:16] But those other two things, the work is
[10:17] easy because it just comes natural to
[10:19] our fallen nature to do those two
[10:21] things. But the results are horrible.
[10:30] 2 Corinthians 10:12,
[10:33] "For we dare not make ourselves of the
[10:35] number, or compare ourselves with some
[10:38] that commend themselves, but they
[10:40] measuring themselves by themselves and
[10:43] comparing themselves among themselves
[10:46] are not wise."
[10:49] So Paul is saying this in context of his
[10:52] ministry and the vindication of his
[10:56] ministry. And he's saying there's
[10:58] apostles out there that have gone forth
[10:59] and they're comparing themselves with
[11:02] each other and they're using each other
[11:04] as their personal recommendation. So I'm
[11:08] in fellowship with this brother. I know
[11:10] this brother. I know this preacher. I
[11:12] know that one. My ministry is like his.
[11:14] My ministry is like that one. And Paul
[11:17] is saying, "Anyone that boasts, let him
[11:19] boast in the Lord and let the Lord
[11:22] commend you." And I think this goes into
[11:26] the life of Christ and letting letting
[11:29] go of things. Let especially letting go
[11:31] of our our own inflated egos.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Is to is to say look
[11:39] whether I commend myself or defend
[11:41] myself
[11:43] or make excus excuses for myself and
[11:46] then compare myself to other people
[11:49] that's not the standard.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. The standard isn't
[11:53] what brother so and so is doing,
[11:56] &gt;&gt; minister so and so is doing. This
[11:59] brother who's upstanding in the church
[12:01] or in the fellowship of people, that's
[12:03] not the standard.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; And if other people approve us, that
[12:07] also is not the standard. Those things
[12:10] can have a diluting quality. Diluting
[12:14] and deliluding quality. It dilutes the
[12:17] grace of God and the power of God in our
[12:19] lives. And it deludes us. deceives us
[12:22] into thinking when that we're just fine
[12:24] and we're okay when we're not.
[12:28] Paul says, "If we make people around us
[12:30] the standard of godliness, you're not
[12:32] wise. You're not walking in wisdom." As
[12:36] you read on further in this chapter 10,
[12:40] he says, "We're supposed to make the
[12:41] Lord our boast and let the Lord prove
[12:43] our works."
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; Self vindication
[12:47] is an indicator of pride. I have to
[12:50] vindicate myself. I have to prove
[12:52] myself. I have to make excuses.
[12:55] When you look at that that way, you see
[12:57] you see that making excuses and you
[13:00] know, you're pointing at someone else as
[13:02] being the scapegoat for the problems
[13:06] that you're facing.
[13:08] And and again, this is one uh blindness
[13:12] that bitterness has is many times when
[13:15] you when you see something that's
[13:17] happened and it hurts you and you point
[13:19] your finger at other people, you're
[13:22] missing the fact that there's actually a
[13:25] problem within you
[13:27] &gt;&gt; that you need to put bring before the
[13:29] Lord to allow him to to to to heal and
[13:33] to pour oil on and to to to deliver you.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; From that very thing that you're looking
[13:40] at and trying to prove I've done this, I
[13:42] did I did I did everything. Well,
[13:46] &gt;&gt; maybe, maybe not.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; But that isn't the point. That's not who
[13:49] we're supposed to look to. We're
[13:50] supposed to look to the Lord.
[13:53] The Lord is our boast. The Lord is our
[13:55] strength. And we want to defend
[13:57] ourselves, defend our position, defend
[14:01] our purpose and vision. When the Lord
[14:03] just says, "Would you lay that all
[14:04] aside?"
[14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:06] lay that all down and die to yourself
[14:08] and let me be your portion. Let me be
[14:11] your purpose. Let me be your vision. Let
[14:14] me prove your works before before the
[14:17] people. We if we have to demand respect,
[14:21] demand that people appreciate us because
[14:24] of our connection here, connection
[14:26] there.
[14:27] Then we're then we're actually in a
[14:29] position where we're walking in pride,
[14:33] &gt;&gt; desire for self vindication.
[14:36] And this is the very way that the Lord
[14:38] turns and begins to resist us.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; Because God resists the proud and gives
[14:43] grace unto the humble. So God actually
[14:45] puts on his war uh outfit and puts his
[14:49] sword on his side and comes and fights
[14:52] against us when we operate in pride. And
[14:56] so he gives grace to the humble. It's
[14:58] the way up is down. As brother Brandham
[15:00] says so simply and humbly, the way up is
[15:02] down. The way down is up. And so
[15:06] pride focuses on self.
[15:09] And humility is not needing to focus on
[15:13] self, but to focus on the blessing and
[15:16] building up of others. Self-p protection
[15:19] and self vindication are outward
[15:22] indicators of pride. Amen.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Our boast is in the Lord and our
[15:28] vindication of our works is of the Lord.
[15:31] Don't don't let your voice prove
[15:33] yourself. Let your life prove itself.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Let and then when the life proves
[15:39] itself, then there's a voice that
[15:40] follows.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; All right.
[15:45] Romans 12:9. Let love going to kind of
[15:48] turn the corner the last 10 to 15
[15:50] minutes and speak about love. So let
[15:54] love be without dissimulation. Abhore
[15:57] that which is evil and cleave to that
[15:59] which is good. This is this love is
[16:03] agape.
[16:04] And it says let love let agape
[16:08] be without dissimulation. Dissimulation
[16:10] speaks of ins insincerity.
[16:14] So and then when we look at sincerity is
[16:17] sincerity speaks of the ability to have
[16:21] the light shined upon it and it to
[16:24] reveal its own goodness in itself. So
[16:28] let love be with in other words he says
[16:31] it without but let it be with sincerity
[16:35] sincere love another place he says
[16:37] unfeigned love of the brethren it's the
[16:40] same idea what is a feain it's mean was
[16:44] when you fake a punch
[16:46] &gt;&gt; when you fake something so don't let
[16:48] your love be with a something that's
[16:51] fake but let it be sincere let it be
[16:54] real let it be genuine and Then right
[16:58] connected to that in order for love to
[17:00] be love you have to hate what that which
[17:02] is evil. Otherwise it's not love.
[17:06] Anything that doesn't any love that
[17:09] doesn't hate evil actually isn't love at
[17:12] all
[17:14] and cleave to that which is good which
[17:16] we understand the only thing that is
[17:19] good is what Jesus says God.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; And so all goodness is of God. So all
[17:24] you know real genuine love has God
[17:28] himself as the source. So again we have
[17:31] in this verse agape. Next verse it has
[17:34] the other two loves that the New
[17:36] Testament speaks of be kindly
[17:39] affectioned one to another with
[17:43] brotherly love in honor preferring one
[17:46] another. So kindly affection means is
[17:48] the word felo stoos. So that's two of
[17:51] the loves right in one word. Filelio is
[17:54] friendship. Stoay is affection or family
[17:56] love. And then then it says brotherly
[17:59] love which is Philadelphia.
[18:02] So there there's there's actually four
[18:05] different kinds of love in the Greek
[18:06] language. In the New Testament, it
[18:08] doesn't speak of aeros love, but there's
[18:12] four different kinds of love in Greek.
[18:16] And I think that's that's a huge point
[18:18] that we have to make in this day is that
[18:21] people use the word love in English. Uh
[18:24] let's just say unbelievers use the word
[18:26] love in English and they say this place
[18:30] has love. People are loving. People are
[18:33] the and it's you have to ask what do you
[18:36] mean by love? What is actually love?
[18:39] Because everybody means something a
[18:41] little bit different today. uh I don't
[18:44] want to get ahead of myself in talking
[18:46] about this but just briefly saying that
[18:49] actually
[18:51] uh what what love people speak about is
[18:54] love is actually a form of hatred
[18:58] when we define love biblically.
[19:01] So let me slow myself down and not get
[19:04] ahead of myself. So the four loves is
[19:07] agape which is divine love, filelio
[19:10] which is friendship, sto which is
[19:12] affection and aeros which is sexual
[19:15] love.
[19:18] So each of these are translated as love
[19:21] into English but they have all have
[19:24] different connotations and different
[19:26] meanings within that. So the human loves
[19:31] are Felio sto and aeros.
[19:38] If you think about aeros it it's
[19:40] actually in our modern sense it's
[19:44] falling in love
[19:46] &gt;&gt; that that process that takes place
[19:48] within the in humans. And I won't spend
[19:51] a lot of time talking about that, but um
[19:55] it it it's one of the human loves.
[19:59] And if you look at all the human loves,
[20:02] each of them contain a kernel of divine
[20:06] love, but each of them are not divine
[20:10] love in and of themselves.
[20:14] But human loves without divine love
[20:19] becomes corrupted.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; So unless unless our human loves felio
[20:27] sto aeros are balanced with agape love
[20:34] they will become distorted and perverted
[20:37] and they'll become complex forms of
[20:41] hatred.
[20:44] So think about this
[20:47] for a moment.
[20:49] Let's consider some situations where
[20:51] people use the word love. But it's not
[20:53] love that is meant. So consider a mother
[20:58] who loves her son so much that she
[21:00] smothers him to the point that he cannot
[21:03] function as a separate human from his
[21:05] mother.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; He doesn't know how to take care of
[21:07] himself. He isn't allowed to find a wife
[21:09] because it would break his mother's
[21:10] heart.
[21:12] Every everyone would say, "Wow, that
[21:13] mother sure loves her son from the
[21:15] outside." But is it love if it stifles
[21:18] and damages growth and the independence
[21:20] of her son?
[21:21] &gt;&gt; No, it isn't love. She's attached to him
[21:24] out of the lack that she has in her own
[21:26] life, but it isn't love. Right?
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Consider a father that dotes on, spends
[21:32] all his time, spends all his money, and
[21:34] he's protecting and guarding his
[21:36] daughters without allowing them to grow,
[21:39] and focuses all his energy on loving his
[21:41] daughter without spending time and
[21:44] energy on his wife.
[21:47] If he had his if he had love in his
[21:48] heart, he would know that he needed to
[21:50] order his love properly. Without
[21:54] ordering your love properly, it's
[21:55] corrupted. And in trying to protect and
[21:58] guard and build up his daughter, he's
[22:01] actually in the long run damaging her
[22:03] because the best he can give to his
[22:05] daughter is to love his mother well.
[22:08] Love the daughter's mother well.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; That's that would be the best love.
[22:13] Consider a mother who in a tragic turn
[22:17] of events, you know, at a young age lost
[22:20] her son and she spends the rest of her
[22:23] life mourning and complaining about the
[22:26] fact that she lost her son. She's
[22:28] drowning in sorrow and every step that
[22:31] she makes, she makes her husband and her
[22:33] other children miserable through her
[22:35] bitterness.
[22:38] What is it? She made an idol. Her love
[22:40] has become an idol out of her deceased
[22:42] son,
[22:44] and she makes everyone bow down to that
[22:46] idol of of sorrow and pain.
[22:51] She'll constantly tell you how much she
[22:53] loved her son. But if she had actual
[22:55] love in her heart, she would learn to
[22:57] move on and let go of bitterness and
[23:00] love her family well.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:13] love begins to be a demon the moment he
[23:17] begins to be a god.
[23:20] I'm going to let that sink in and and
[23:22] break that down a little bit. So when
[23:26] you when love
[23:32] let let me let me back up and put it
[23:33] this way. In other words, when when
[23:35] human love reaches its highest point,
[23:41] humanly speaking, it often claims for
[23:43] itself divine authority.
[23:47] And then that love actually begins to
[23:50] override
[23:51] all other obligations, right?
[23:55] &gt;&gt; It demands unconditional allegiance.
[24:00] When it does that, it actually turns in
[24:02] and becomes a demon and destroys both
[24:05] both us and itself. It corrupts its own
[24:09] self and corrupts those who have it in
[24:12] themselves also.
[24:14] I know that's that's a little bit of a
[24:16] heavy thought because we always see love
[24:19] as always being positive, but it isn't
[24:23] always positive. what we call love
[24:25] because without divine love inserted
[24:28] into the human loves it always reaches a
[24:31] zenith and becomes a god. Consider
[24:33] people consider the story of Romeo and
[24:36] Juliet. They fall in love and whoo what
[24:40] a story of love. They're literally
[24:42] insane.
[24:43] They've literally lost his mind. They
[24:45] won't listen to reason. They won't
[24:46] listen to anyone else. They see no fault
[24:50] in one another and they're willing to
[24:51] die for the sake of their love. Their
[24:53] love became a demon.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; And we can go on. A mother's love can
[24:59] become a demon. A father's love can
[25:02] become a demon. If things love is not
[25:05] ordered properly, it becomes evil.
[25:09] It becomes it becomes something that's
[25:11] awful. It comes becomes something that's
[25:13] distorted and ugly. Think about our
[25:16] modern day where you have all these
[25:18] signs that people put in their uh yard.
[25:20] Love is love.
[25:23] We don't see it as much here, but go to
[25:24] Minnesota and drive down the road for
[25:26] two seconds, you'll see 10 Lutheran
[25:28] churches that have signs like that. Love
[25:30] is love. And how could it be wrong if
[25:32] they love each other?
[25:34] It because it's it's evil because it's
[25:38] distorted. It's perverted. And that's
[25:40] where it is. It's literally demanding
[25:44] obedience and worship. If you don't obey
[25:47] me and worship me, you're evil.
[25:51] If the love is not according to God's
[25:54] program, it's evil. And it's not and
[25:56] it's not even love at all.
[26:05] As we talked about the word aeros,
[26:08] aeros,
[26:10] that's a it's a form of love. Absolutely
[26:12] is. God has planted it within us, I
[26:16] believe, to be able to continue to
[26:17] propagate the human race. Otherwise, if
[26:19] everyone went into uh uh marriage with a
[26:22] clear mind, they'd be terrified of the
[26:25] commitment that they were going into.
[26:27] But because there's such a thing called
[26:29] eros that overrides many many many of
[26:32] those things otherwise we wouldn't have
[26:35] any human race left. And so falling in
[26:38] love, it's fine. But if you don't
[26:40] understand it's the limitations of
[26:42] falling in love or that even many times
[26:45] you can hardly control it. It it simply
[26:48] happens. Just because it happens doesn't
[26:50] mean you have to obey it. There's a
[26:52] thing called self-control.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Uh aeros misdirected is a demon.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; But a aeros between husband and wife
[27:03] sub surrendered to agape love is
[27:05] perfectly
[27:07] &gt;&gt; good and normal and positive.
[27:09] Understanding that it comes and it goes.
[27:13] It's not something you can't live your
[27:15] entire life like that otherwise you'd
[27:16] never make any money.
[27:19] You'd never be able to live. You'd never
[27:21] be able to function.
[27:24] But God uses it. But as long as we
[27:26] understand its limitations and
[27:28] understand that self-control
[27:31] is required
[27:33] and again
[27:36] love is love. No, it's not. There's none
[27:39] good save one and that is God. So unless
[27:42] it's the love which comes from God,
[27:46] it's not good at all. Human love without
[27:49] God
[27:51] is disordered and perverted. It's love.
[27:54] It's a form of love, but it will always
[27:56] grow into something that's distorted and
[28:00] causes pain and evil.
[28:05] So, we have two minutes left. I doubt I
[28:09] can finish this, but
[28:12] we'll get it started. So, what is divine
[28:15] love?
[28:18] It's election.
[28:21] The the proof of his love is election.
[28:24] We'll we'll just skim over this quickly
[28:26] and we'll have to pick up next time.
[28:28] That no matter what happened, his love
[28:30] was proven truly by the fact that they
[28:32] were chosen unto salvation.
[28:36] He may commit you to death as he did
[28:38] Paul. He may commit you to suffering as
[28:39] he did Job. That's his prerogative. He's
[28:41] sovereign. But it's all with a purpose.
[28:44] So love
[28:46] that he the love that is elective love
[28:49] has a purpose to it. So what is the
[28:52] purpose of it?
[28:54] It's it's that you after you after
[28:56] you've suffered a while, you'd be made
[28:59] perfect, be established, strengthened,
[29:02] and settled.
[29:05] We'll go over it again in plain
[29:07] language. The very character of Jesus
[29:09] was perfected by suffering. And
[29:10] according to Paul, he has left his
[29:12] church a measure of suffering that they
[29:13] too by their faith in God while
[29:15] suffering for him would come to a place
[29:17] of perfection. So as we look at this, as
[29:20] we come to a close, what is agape love?
[29:23] What is divine love? Divine love is a
[29:26] power or force that extends itself for
[29:28] the purpose of spiritual growth.
[29:31] God has chosen you in Christ before the
[29:33] foundation of the world for what
[29:35] purpose? To grow up into Christ. That is
[29:38] divine love. That is the love that God
[29:41] has for us. That is the love that God
[29:43] wants us to have for one another.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Let's stand and pray.
[29:53] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[29:54] word. Lord, we pray that you'd write it
[29:56] on our hearts. Help us to walk in this
[29:59] agape love. You are love, Lord, and
[30:02] we're so thankful for that.
[30:05] We pray that the that the very agape
[30:08] love of God would be shed abroad in our
[30:10] hearts by the Holy Ghost. Lord, help us
[30:13] to be molded and shaped into that. We
[30:16] commit ourselves.
