[6:30] the name of Jesus Christ this morning,
[6:33] presenting ourselves before you, Father,
[6:36] Lord, that you could look to the cross
[6:39] and see white, pure and righteousness
[6:44] because of what you have done.
[6:46] We pray that your presence would just
[6:48] sweep through the building [music] this

[6:51] Strengthen everyone. Encourage everyone,
[6:53] Father, to draw closer to you. For you
[6:56] are a good, good father. Lord, we love
[7:00] you this morning. We [music] pray that

[7:26] house that we [music] dwell in. And

[7:31] all these things, Lord.
[7:33] Lord, as your [music] church marches
[7:35] forward to Zion, Father, we rejoice in

[37:37] I went to hear the word
[37:42] and with each line and praise
[37:51] he was drawing
[37:54] me to give a higher
[38:00] praise.
[38:05] There's a deep [music]
[38:08] call to the deep
[38:11] like a great magnet
[38:15] pulling
[38:16] me. [music] I know for sure
[38:22] that I've reached my goal cuz I feel the
[38:27] boom.
[38:29] [singing]
[38:30] [music]
[38:31] I feel the voice.
[38:36] [music]
[38:38] I hear the call.
[38:46] And I know his spirit
[38:49] [music] moving me to give my all. Amen.
[38:57] Oh, he speaks [music]
[39:00] to me
[39:05] and I [singing]
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, please come [singing]
[39:16] and take control.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; I feel the
[39:19] &gt;&gt; I feel the
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I wonder if we could just go
[39:24] to the Lord in prayer. Master, how we
[39:27] thank you for that great pull of the
[39:29] word that we feel the pull in this hour.
[39:32] Lord, what would we do? The Bible said,
[39:34] "Had you not left us a seed, we also
[39:37] would be like unto Sodom and Gomorrah."
[39:39] I thank you, Lord, for the gospel that
[39:41] you sent to us, for the presence of the
[39:44] Holy Spirit, for the gene of the living
[39:46] God that lies within our soul. Master,
[39:48] if it weren't for you, we wouldn't stand
[39:50] a chance. We commit ourselves to you
[39:53] today for service. Now, we stand here
[39:56] before your people. Uh the vessel is
[39:59] quite unworthy, but you are worthy,
[40:01] Lord. And we're not here. I'm not here
[40:02] to give them my words, [music] only your
[40:04] words, Lord.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; I pray you'll bless the speaker and the
[40:07] hearer today. Give us hearing hearts.
[40:10] May we now just shut out the world and
[40:12] lay everything aside. The day will take
[40:14] care of itself. Sufficient is the day.
[40:16] It'll take care of itself. Lord, let us
[40:18] now arrest our mind from wondering
[40:21] thoughts and other activities. Now,
[40:24] we're coming down to be focused on your
[40:26] [music] word. So, I commit it to you
[40:28] now. Commit myself into your hands,
[40:30] Lord, for service to your kingdom. It to
[40:33] me, it's the greatest privilege, Lord, I
[40:36] could ever have. You gave me the
[40:38] greatest desire of my heart, Lord, since
[40:40] a young boy. This is all I ever wanted
[40:42] to be was your servant, Father. So, I
[40:45] commit it now. Commit myself into your
[40:47] hands and all the people for the word
[40:49] today. the hearing and receiving, the
[40:51] preaching, the hearing, the recognize,
[40:54] the recognizing, and the acting upon
[40:57] your [music] word. We commit it to you
[40:58] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[41:01] you, friends. Praise the Lord. Want to
[41:05] um invite you to Isaiah chapter 14. And
[41:08] while you're turning there to Isaiah 14,
[41:12] we're going to just make a couple of
[41:13] quick announcements while I have you
[41:16] here before um the musicians are um
[41:19] dismissed to transition back around.
[41:22] Um you may notice um a new sign
[41:25] regarding the Sunday school class that
[41:27] takes place in the fellowship hall. You
[41:30] need to understand that this sign was
[41:32] approved by me. In case you see it and
[41:34] you wonder who had the audacity, it was
[41:36] approved by me. All right. Sunday school
[41:40] is 10:30 to to 11:15.
[41:44] Please refrain from using the fellowship
[41:47] hall during this time. If you need to
[41:50] place food in the fridge, please do so
[41:52] quickly and quietly. Whatever you do,
[41:56] don't be lingering out there when Sunday
[41:58] school is scheduled to start at 10:30.
[42:00] whether it has started or not. Clear the
[42:02] sun, clear the fellowship hall, please,
[42:04] and try to stay out of there until
[42:05] 11:15, unless you need to put food in
[42:07] there or you've got some other um
[42:10] official purpose. Amen. But we want to
[42:12] have our children be able to have an
[42:14] undisturbed lesson. Will that be all
[42:16] right?
[42:17] &gt;&gt; All right. Praise the Lord. Um we have a
[42:20] couple of prayer requests today and then
[42:21] I want to make one quick camp
[42:23] announcement. I want to ask you all uh
[42:25] for extra prayers uh for Sister Debbie.
[42:28] She made it here today. Amen. It didn't
[42:31] look promising, but the Lord was
[42:32] gracious. And she's suffering a lot from
[42:35] her hip, which has then which threw her
[42:38] gate off, which then threw her back out,
[42:39] which then causes the sciatica. So, you
[42:42] know, Brother Brandham said, when when
[42:44] the enemy thinks he's got you down,
[42:45] that's when he pours it on. So, um,
[42:48] she's been twice to an orthopedic. She's
[42:50] got one more appointment to go. And so,
[42:52] we just want to find the Lord's perfect
[42:54] mind. Will you do that? Amen. Praise the
[42:56] Lord. Sister Melissa would like a prayer
[42:58] cloth for a fellow teacher battling
[43:00] breast cancer diagnosis. So, um, to the
[43:04] brothers, the deacons, don't let me
[43:05] forget that. Wave at me. I've got it at
[43:07] the end of my notes, so hopefully I
[43:09] won't forget it. I want to make a quick
[43:11] camp announcement regarding camp. Um, so
[43:15] [clears throat]
[43:17] you're already aware that camp on the
[43:20] Sunday service on on October the 19th,
[43:24] we'll be at camp. So there won't be any
[43:26] Sunday service here. There'll be a
[43:28] Sunday service at camp which will be
[43:30] livereamed.
[43:32] But one of the things that I'm doing
[43:34] this year is I'm suspending the
[43:37] Wednesday prior and the Wednesday
[43:39] following camp. We always suspend the
[43:42] prior Wednesday because we basically
[43:44] have to take the church apart and all
[43:46] the brothers pull out all the equipment
[43:47] and all the instruments and everything
[43:49] and there's a big load up and so and
[43:51] then we've tried to do it on the
[43:53] Wednesday following camp but it's a mad
[43:55] dash to try to get everything back, get
[43:57] the church rebuilt and everybody feels
[43:59] like zombies already. The camp is taxing
[44:03] very very
[44:06] taxing. Amen. And we have loyal teams
[44:09] who have already been working for months
[44:12] just for those four days in the
[44:14] mountains with our young people. Um it's
[44:17] a it's it's it's a massive undertaking.
[44:20] It's we definitely are punching above
[44:21] our weight class. We're not a large
[44:23] church and when I walk around and look
[44:25] at what we pull off over there, I get
[44:26] scared to death looking at it. But every
[44:28] year the Lord comes on the scene and we
[44:31] have just a wonderful time. So, so to
[44:35] circle [snorts] back, Sunday the 12th
[44:39] will be the last service here until it
[44:42] resumes here on the 26th. There will be
[44:46] plenty of services.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; During those times, they just won't be
[44:51] held at 2608 Mossios Road. Amen. Is that
[44:54] pretty clear?
[44:55] &gt;&gt; And then, um, also a special
[44:57] announcement from the teams. Please, um,
[45:01] let's see which, let me get to it. Um
[45:05] yes. So this is concerning next Sunday.
[45:07] So not today, but this is for next
[45:09] Sunday when we do the load up. Following
[45:12] next Sunday's service, we have to take
[45:15] everything apart, load up the U-Haul,
[45:17] and please uh one brother sent it to me
[45:21] and he said, "Employ the people." I
[45:22] mean, implore the people, but it may be
[45:24] better to say employ the people, but
[45:26] nobody's getting paid.
[45:29] Implore the people. Amen. that we need
[45:31] all the help. Men, women, and children.
[45:35] Amen. So, um, so we want to everyone,
[45:38] everyone is needed. Make sure to specify
[45:41] brothers and sisters and children. We
[45:43] need all the hands we can possibly get.
[45:46] Amen. So, that'll be next Sunday. So, I
[45:49] hope that's clear. And, uh, we'll be
[45:51] pushing out um, messages on the church
[45:54] WhatsApp at any rate. So, you be in
[45:55] prayer for those things. Will you do it?
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're happy today to have brother
[46:00] Jimmy here. Praise the Lord. And David
[46:02] and Michael are here. Now, they were
[46:04] just little guys since last time I saw
[46:05] him, so I'm not sure who's which. So,
[46:07] who?
[46:08] &gt;&gt; David.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Which?
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Michael. David. Okay. So, David here.
[46:13] All right, everybody turn around.
[46:15] Michael's right here in the black shirt.
[46:17] Then Jimmy in the in the suit. And then
[46:19] David. I mean, yeah, David in a suit
[46:21] also. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's not
[46:23] hard to tell. Amen. Uh, whose boys they
[46:25] are. Praise the Lord. So, Sister
[46:27] Jennifer's family. Amen. [clears throat]
[46:29] Praise the Lord, Brother Jimmy. We've
[46:30] been trying to keep you, I mean, get you
[46:32] here for a long time. Amen. So,
[46:34] [laughter]
[46:35] Amen. Also happy to have the brother in
[46:37] the back and different ones. God bless
[46:38] you. We're happy to have visitors here.
[46:40] Amen. If I'm overlooking you, you
[46:41] forgive me. I'm bad for that. But, Amen.
[46:43] Let's look at our text in Isaiah chapter
[46:47] 14. Let's see. [clears throat]
[46:50] in Isaiah 14
[46:53] and we'll just read a single verse and
[46:55] we'll let you be seated and we'll
[46:56] continue reading. Um, so brother Mark, I
[47:00] meant to start at Revelation 21. I'm
[47:02] sorry. Let's go to Revelation 21 1-7. In
[47:05] fact, I think that's what I sent the
[47:07] booth. Almost sure of that.
[47:12] [clears throat]
[47:13] I did. Yeah, my apologies. Revelation 21
[47:16] 1-7. Nothing like having a team ready
[47:19] and then you change change on a
[47:21] midstream.
[47:23] Amen. I appreciate uh our booth
[47:25] personnel, all the [clears throat] all
[47:26] of our wonderful teams and personnel.
[47:28] It's a camaraderie that's out of this
[47:30] world. Amen. Praise the Lord. Revelation
[47:34] 21
[47:36] 1-7. And we'll just catch this verse
[47:39] first verse. Want to preach to you today
[47:41] on Lucifer's competing claim. Lucifer's
[47:45] competing claim.
[47:48] Revelation 21 1-7.
[47:51] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[47:55] For the first heaven and the first earth
[47:58] were passed away, and there was no more
[48:01] sea.
[48:02] Father, we thank you for the beginning
[48:04] of reading in your word. And now, may
[48:07] your anointing be upon us as we look to
[48:09] go forward now. We go in your name in
[48:11] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless
[48:14] you, friends. You can be seated. And uh
[48:16] we will continue uh reading our passage.
[48:32] Set all this out here to make sure that
[48:33] I don't forget anything.
[48:37] Amen. [clears throat]
[48:40] Verse two.
[48:43] Revelation 21 verse two.
[48:46] And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem,
[48:50] coming down from God out of heaven,
[48:53] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[48:56] husband. Verse three.
[49:00] And I heard a great voice out of heaven,
[49:02] saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is
[49:06] with men, and he will dwell with them,
[49:10] and they shall be his people, and God
[49:13] himself shall be with them, and be their
[49:16] God. And God shall wipe away all tears
[49:20] from their eyes. And there shall be no
[49:22] more death, neither sorrow, nor crying,
[49:26] neither shall there be any more pain,
[49:29] for the former things are passed away.
[49:31] Isn't that beautiful?
[49:33] &gt;&gt; And he that sat upon the throne said,
[49:36] "Behold, I make all things new." And he
[49:39] said unto me, "Write, for these words
[49:41] are true and faithful. He that
[49:44] overcomemeth shall inherit all things,
[49:48] and I will be his God, and he shall be
[49:51] my son.
[49:54] Wonderful, wonderful promises. And this
[49:57] is a tremendous claim that God is
[50:00] making. I mean, he he didn't he didn't
[50:04] his language wasn't vague. He He's He's
[50:08] going to wipe away all tears. He's going
[50:10] to tabernacle himself with men. All the
[50:14] former things are going to be done away
[50:16] with. And whoever overcomes um will
[50:20] inherit all things and he'll be to them
[50:22] a god and they'll be to him a son.
[50:24] That's quite a claim.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; But now I want to take you today back to
[50:29] Isaiah chapter 14 because Lucifer has a
[50:33] competing claim against against God.
[50:36] Amen. [clears throat]
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 14 and we'll begin at verse 12.
[50:44] How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[50:47] Lucifer, son of the morning. How art
[50:50] thou cut down to the ground which d
[50:54] weakened the nations. For thou has set
[50:57] in thine heart, now here's his claim, I
[51:00] will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[51:04] throne above the stars of God. I will
[51:08] sit also upon the mount of the
[51:10] congregation and the sides of the north.
[51:13] This a quite a counter claim
[51:15] &gt;&gt; to what we read in Revelation 21.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; I mean the the you know these are these
[51:22] are not mutually exclusive claims. They
[51:25] cannot both be true at the same time.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody's going to win and meet
[51:31] their claim, and somebody's going to
[51:33] lose and fail to meet their claim.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; But they're both claiming.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Verse 14 again. I will ascend above the
[51:42] heights of the clouds. I will be like
[51:45] the most high. Yet thou shalt be brought
[51:49] down to hell, to the sides of the pit,
[51:53] that they that see thee shall narrowly
[51:56] look upon thee, and consider thee,
[51:59] saying, Is this the man that made the
[52:03] earth to tremble, that did shake
[52:06] kingdoms, that made the world as a
[52:09] wilderness, and destroyed the cities
[52:11] thereof, that opened not the house of
[52:14] his prisoners? All the kings of the
[52:18] nations, even all of them lie in glory,
[52:21] everyone in his own house. But thou art
[52:24] cast out of thy grave like an abominable
[52:27] branch, and as the raignment of those
[52:30] that are slain, thrust through with the
[52:32] sword that go down to the stones of the
[52:35] pit, as a carcass trotten under feet.
[52:39] Thou shalt not be joined with them in
[52:41] burial because thou hast destroyed thy
[52:45] land and slain thy people. The seed of
[52:48] evildoers shall never be renowned.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; It's interesting that the Bible
[52:58] would refer to Lucifer here being
[53:02] brought forth for slaughter and the
[53:04] world would see him as a man. Now, you
[53:07] know, there's nothing in the Bible
[53:08] that's accidental, but when I read that,
[53:11] it's not lost on me that remember that
[53:15] Lucifer is was an angel. He was an
[53:17] archangel was not a a human man. And so,
[53:21] the very fact that the Bible is showing
[53:23] that Lucifer in a perfect counterfeit
[53:26] operates through man just like the Holy
[53:29] Spirit operates through man. Amen. So
[53:31] God is a spirit and God lives in his
[53:35] family and and and we find that ONCE THE
[53:38] HOLY GHOST CAME on the on the earth.
[53:41] Then once again the word was made flesh
[53:45] in a many member bride JUST LIKE IT WAS
[53:48] MADE FLESH in Jesus of Nazareth and he
[53:51] went about doing good. But we know that
[53:53] HE WAS NEVER INTENDING. GOD WAS NEVER
[53:55] INTENDING TO stay bottled up in one man
[53:59] walking THE SHORES OF GALILEE GOING
[54:01] ABOUT DOING GOOD. NOW THE PEOPLE WANTED
[54:03] HIM TO STAY. THEY WANTED TO MAKE HIM A
[54:05] KING. AND HE KEPT SAYING TO THEM, "IT'S
[54:08] BETTER FOR YOU IF I GO AWAY." WE HAD
[54:10] THAT here recently. I think it was uh
[54:12] BROTHER BENNY PERHAPS WAS TALKING ABOUT
[54:14] HOW THAT IT'S UH IT'S TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
[54:17] THAT HE SUFFER AND DIE. IT'S TO YOUR
[54:20] ADVANTAGE BECAUSE IF HE IF HE DIES THEN
[54:22] HE CAN RESURRECT AND IF HE RESURRECTS
[54:24] THEN HE CAN EMPTY PARADISE AND THEN IF
[54:26] HE ASCENDS AND COMES BACK THEN HE CAN
[54:28] GET THE WHOLE FAMILY.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; SO I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TODAY THAT THE
[54:33] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IS A REALLY
[54:35] GOOD THING AND YOU SHOULD SEEK IT WITH
[54:38] ALL THAT IS WITHIN YOU. IT IS WHAT
[54:41] ADOPTS YOU INTO THE FAMILY AND MAKES YOU
[54:44] A SON OF GOD THAT GOD PROMISED WHOEVER
[54:46] WOULD OVERCOME WOULD I WILL BE HIS GOD
[54:49] AND HE WILL BE MY SON. I KNOW LUCIFER
[54:52] MADE A COUNTER CLAIM BACK THERE
[54:54] THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. MY PROPHET OUTED
[54:57] HIM TOLD YOU THE SECRET IN HIS HEART.
[54:59] THAT WAS HIS CLAIM. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL
[55:01] YOU, I'M MAKING ANOTHER CLAIM THAT I'M
[55:03] MAKING ALL THINGS NEW AND I'M GOING TO
[55:06] HAVE A people
[55:08] &gt;&gt; who ARE GOING TO BE MY FAMILY. THESE ARE
[55:11] THESE ARE SOME SERIOUS COUNTER CLAIMS. I
[55:13] DON'T THINK YOU COULD GET MORE POLAR
[55:15] OPPOSITES.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Than the claim that Lucifer made versus
[55:21] the claim that God made. Amen.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; When you read
[55:29] Isaiah 14,
[55:31] it is it it it literally is a UM
[55:35] ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET DOWN AROUND
[55:37] VERSE FOUR AND ON. WE'RE NOT GOING TO
[55:38] DROP BACK AND read it, BUT WHEN YOU GO
[55:40] FOR GO from there, VERSE FOUR SAYS THAT
[55:43] THOU SHALT TAKE UP THIS proverb against
[55:46] the king of Babylon. So, right away, the
[55:51] prophet is going to
[55:53] speaking under inspiration
[55:55] IS GOING TO symbolize Lucifer because a
[55:59] LITTLE BIT LATER, 10 VERSES LATER, HE
[56:01] IDENTIFIES WHO HE'S TALKING ABOUT. HOW
[56:02] ART THOU fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer?
[56:04] Oh, wait. I thought he's TALKING ABOUT
[56:05] THE KING OF BABYLON. HE WAS THE KING OF
[56:08] BABYLON IS JUST A PLACEHOLDER. REMEMBER,
[56:11] IT'S SATAN OPERATING THROUGH PEOPLE.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; IS THIS THE MAN THAT DESTROYED THE
[56:17] WORLD? and and you know THE THE THE YOU
[56:20] DON'T FIND ANYBODY SAYING, "HEY, GOD, IT
[56:23] WAS ALL HIM. WE'RE JUST INNOCENT
[56:26] BYSTANDERS." BUT THE BUT BUT THE FACT IS
[56:28] THAT THEY ALLOWED SATAN TO HAVE A
[56:31] DOMINION IN THEIR MIND AND THEY CHOSE
[56:33] WHEN THEY KNEW GOD AS GOD. THE BIBLE
[56:36] SAYS THEY MADE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE NOT TO
[56:38] WORSHIP HIM AS GOD.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; BIBLE'S CLEAR on that.
[56:44] YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES, UH, ATHEISTS
[56:46] WHO AND PEOPLE WHO HATE THE BIBLE, THEY
[56:49] THEY GO BACK AND THEY TALK ABOUT
[56:50] PREDESTINATION OR ELECTION. THEY DON'T
[56:52] UNDERSTAND election by origin. It's why
[56:54] they it's why it's in Congress to them.
[56:56] But, YOU KNOW, THEY SAY, "HEY, YOU KNOW,
[56:59] UH, WHY WOULD YOU BLAME PHARAOH? WHY
[57:01] DOES PHARAOH HAVE TO end up in hell?"
[57:03] Because the Bible says Pharaoh descends
[57:05] down into the pit.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Why? That's not fair. Because God
[57:08] hardened HIS HEART. BUT SIX TIMES AT
[57:11] LEAST FIVE AND MAYBE SIX BEFORE GOD EVER
[57:14] HARDENED PHARAOH'S HEART THE FIRST TIME.
[57:16] FIVE OR SIX TIMES PRIOR TO THAT PHARAOH
[57:18] HARDENED HIS OWN HEART.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; See that's the scripture.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO READ IT, READ all
[57:24] of it. See, SO WHEN JESUS COMES AND
[57:27] SAYS, YOU KNOW, UH, THUS IS FULFILLED IN
[57:30] YOU PHARISEES THE SAYING OF THE PROPHET,
[57:33] IN SEEING THEY SEE NOT, AND IN HEARING
[57:35] THEY HEAR NOT, LEST THEY SEE WITH THEIR
[57:36] EYES AND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS AND AND
[57:39] BELIEVE AND BE CONVERTED AND I WOULD
[57:40] HAVE TO HEAL THEM.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; BUT BUT HE GOES BACK AND JESUS ADDS AN
[57:44] ADDENDUM TO THE VERSE THAT THE PROPHET
[57:47] DIDN'T SAY. WHEN JESUS QUOTES IT, HE
[57:49] SAYS, "THEIR EYES THEY HAVE CLOSED."
[57:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; LEST THEY SHOULD SEE
[57:56] &gt;&gt; AND HEAR.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO SO THIS IS WHERE PAUL GOES BACK
[58:00] TO THESE ANCIENT PEOPLE BECAUSE WHEN
[58:02] THEY KNEW GOD, THEY CHOSE NOT TO WORSHIP
[58:04] HIM AS GOD. THEY DIDN'T WANT GOD IN
[58:05] THEIR THINKING. AND THEREFORE, GOD SAYS,
[58:07] "OKAY, FINE. I GAVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY,
[58:10] BUT NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT MY WORD, YOU
[58:12] CROSS THAT LINE FOR THE LAST TIME, THEN
[58:15] I WILL BLIND YOU AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE MY
[58:17] WORD. I'LL HARDEN YOUR HEART AND YOU'LL
[58:19] NEVER BELIEVE MY WORD. BUT YOU WILL
[58:20] BELIEVE SOMETHING ONLY IT'LL BE A LIE.
[58:23] YOU'LL BE BELIEVE A COUNTER CLAIM.
[58:25] YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH A COUNTERPERSON.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT. AS PAUL
[58:30] SAID, MY FEAR OF THE CHURCH IS THAT
[58:33] YOU'LL FOLLOW ANOTHER JESUS
[58:37] WHO IS NOT ONE I PREACHED to you,
[58:40] &gt;&gt; a different one. A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE
[58:42] SAY, "I JUST WANT JESUS." AND I SAY,
[58:44] "WELL, WHICH ONE?"
[58:45] &gt;&gt; WELL, I THOUGHT THERE WAS ONLY ONE. NOT
[58:46] ACCORDING TO ST. PAUL, THERE WAS ANOTHER
[58:48] JESUS, A MAN-MADE CREATION OF ORGANIZED
[58:52] RELIGION. THIS VERY [screaming] KING OF
[58:54] BABYLON, WHICH WAS REALLY LUCIFER, IS
[58:56] BEHIND IT ALL.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE HERE, FRIENDS, IN A IN AN EPIC
[59:01] BATTLE OF EPIC PROPORTION. AND THIS
[59:04] THING IS ANCIENT AND IT'S BEEN GOING ON
[59:06] FOR MULTIPLE MILLENNIA, BUT IT'S COMING
[59:08] TO A CLIMAX.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; AND SOMEBODY'S CLAIM IS GOING TO HAVE TO
[59:13] GO FORWARD. IT'LL EITHER BE LUCIFER'S OR
[59:15] IT'LL BE GOD'S.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; WHOSE CLAIM YOU WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED
[59:20] WITH?
[59:22] &gt;&gt; ME, TOO.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; WELL, IF YOU WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH
[59:25] GOD, YOU HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH HIS
[59:28] WORD.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; SO, WHEN HE GOES TALKING ABOUT BABYLON
[59:34] AND THEN YOU READ DOWN where
[59:37] where we read in our description, my
[59:39] goodness, you're not even going to GET A
[59:40] DECENT BURIAL. YOU'RE GOING TO DESCEND
[59:42] DOWN. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK NARROWLY
[59:44] UPON YOU. WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO LET
[59:46] YOU BE BURIED.
[59:48] YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE A
[59:49] COMPLETE AND WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO
[59:51] HONOR YOU WITH A GRAVE.
[59:53] SEE, NOW
[59:56] TH THIS IS A LOT. THIS IS QUITE A LOT TO
[1:00:00] DO TO ONE NATION and its ruler WHEN YOU
[1:00:05] THINK OF BABYLON. UH AND IF IT WERE NOT
[1:00:08] THAT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THIS TO BE A
[1:00:10] VERY ANCIENT BEAST SYSTEM OF ANTICHRIST,
[1:00:14] IT WOULD SEEM LIKE UNEQUAL JUSTICE.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; The description of WHERE WE READ IN
[1:00:19] ISAIAH 14 SEEMS LIKE ALMOST CRUEL and
[1:00:22] unusual punishment
[1:00:24] uh disproportionate to the crimes that
[1:00:27] Babylon committed. REMEMBER THAT ANCIENT
[1:00:30] BABYLON WAS NOT THE ONLY oppressor
[1:00:33] recorded in history and IN FACT IN SCALE
[1:00:36] IT WAS NOT EVEN THE WORST TIME OF
[1:00:39] SUFFERING HUMANITY. UH SO WE ARE
[1:00:42] WITNESSING HERE IN ISAIAH 14 WHAT SURELY
[1:00:47] MUST NOT BE REFERRING TO AN ANCIENT
[1:00:50] NATION BUT WE'RE READING THE DEMISE OR
[1:00:54] LET ME SAY IT LIKE THIS YOU'RE READING
[1:00:56] THE FINAL END OF LUCIFER'S REIGN. AMEN.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD IS DONE WITH him
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; and I'm can't wait
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; KNOW FROM GOD'S WORD OF COURSE that
[1:01:11] there are three ACTUALLY DESTRUCTIONS OF
[1:01:14] BABYLON. YOU HAVE DURING THE 6TH CENTURY
[1:01:17] BC 539 to be exact. Uh you have the
[1:01:20] ancient Babylonian Empire which we know
[1:01:24] was overthrown by the Meo Persian
[1:01:26] Empire. Now this is not to be confused
[1:01:28] with the the what they call the old
[1:01:30] Babylon which was pretty much 1100 more
[1:01:33] than a millennium uh previous.
[1:01:36] [clears throat]
[1:01:36] This was the time of Nebuchadnezzar and
[1:01:39] and and Beltazar and and and THIS WAS A
[1:01:43] RESURGENT BABYLON JUST LIKE NOW THAT'S
[1:01:46] NOT THAT SHOULDN'T YOU SAY YOU MEAN
[1:01:48] BABYLON existed 1100 years PRIOR TO THE
[1:01:52] ONE THAT THE MEO PERSIANS SACKED? YEAH.
[1:01:54] THAT WHAT YOU'RE READING THE ONE THE ME
[1:01:56] PER THAT THAT ONE ONLY LASTED LESS THAN
[1:01:58] A CENTURY
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S IN THE BIBLE THE OTHER ONE IS
[1:02:02] IS JUST A FOOTNOTE IN HISTORY YOU SEE
[1:02:04] WHAT YOU REALIZE IS FRIENDS UM IS
[1:02:07] [clears throat] IF I SAY IT LIKE THIS
[1:02:09] THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT
[1:02:12] REALLY ON GOD'S CALENDAR UNTIL YOU ARE
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; UNTIL TIME MEETS PROPHECY
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; AND GOD STARTS COUNTING AND HE PUTS
[1:02:20] MARKERS OUT SO THAT SO THAT HE CAN SO
[1:02:22] THAT HE KEEPS TRACK OF HISTORY AND AND
[1:02:24] OUR AND THE FAMILY CAN LOOK BACK AND
[1:02:26] LEARN, OH, THIS MEANT THIS AND THIS
[1:02:28] MEANT THIS AND THIS MUST BE WHERE WE ARE
[1:02:30] NOW.
[1:02:31] [clears throat]
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; SAY, you don't HAVE A RIGHT TO DO THAT.
[1:02:33] DANIEL DID IT.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; DANIEL, BY THE STUDY OF BOOKS, HE
[1:02:36] LEARNED THAT, HEY, WE'RE ALMOST AT THE
[1:02:38] END. 70 YEARS IS COMING UP AND WE SHOULD
[1:02:41] BE GETTING OUT OF HERE IF THE PROPHECY
[1:02:43] IS TRUE.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; SO, [clears throat] IT'S A RESURGENT
[1:02:48] BABYLON. SEE, IT'S JUST LIKE IT'S JUST
[1:02:51] LIKE REVELATION 13 BECAUSE YOU REMEMBER
[1:02:54] THAT THAT AN BABYLON WHICH WAS SPIRITUAL
[1:02:59] BABYLON SPOKEN OF IN THE BOOK OF
[1:03:00] REVELATION, WE'LL GET to it in a minute.
[1:03:02] That that IS A RELIGIOUS SYSTEM.
[1:03:05] REMEMBER, IT WAS in Imperial Rome. IT
[1:03:08] WAS A A REPUBLIC. THEN BY THE TIME YOU
[1:03:10] GET TO A TO AUGUSTUS, NOW IT'S AN
[1:03:12] EMPIRE. AND IT AND IT'S IMPERIAL AND AND
[1:03:15] POLITICAL ROME ENDS. AND THEN PAP ROME
[1:03:18] COMES ON THE SCENE. AND THAT'S ALL
[1:03:19] HAPPENING OVER IN EUROPE BECAUSE THE
[1:03:21] BIBLE TALKS ABOUT THAT BEAST SYSTEM ROSE
[1:03:24] UP OUT OF THE SEA WHICH WAS MANY
[1:03:26] PEOPLES, MULTITUDES, AND NATIONS. BUT
[1:03:28] WHEN YOU GET TO REVELATION 13, YOU GO ON
[1:03:31] DOWN INTO REVELATION 13, YOU FIND OUT
[1:03:33] THAT ANOTHER BEAST CAME UP THAT LOOKED
[1:03:34] LIKE A lamb
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; and IT ROSE UP OUT OF THE LAND, NOT THE
[1:03:38] SEA WHERE THERE WERE NO ESTABLISHED
[1:03:40] CIVILIZED NATIONS. HE HAD AN INDIGENOUS
[1:03:42] PEOPLE. SO, IT'S JUST SATAN, YOU KNOW,
[1:03:46] BECAUSE HE HE GOT A WOUNDED HEAD
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; AND BUT AND BECAUSE WHEN ROME FALLS AND
[1:03:51] THEN AND THEN AND THEN I DON'T WANT TO
[1:03:52] DEAL WITH THE SUCCESSIVE UH YEARS OF OF
[1:03:55] THE PAPACY, BUT IT COMES ACROSS THE POND
[1:03:58] AND IT RESURGES HERE IN AMERICA. LISTEN
[1:04:02] FRIENDS, THAT'S THE WAY SATAN DOES.
[1:04:03] WHETHER HE'S OLD BABYLON OR WHETHER HE
[1:04:05] COMES BACK TO BE ANCIENT BABYLON OR
[1:04:07] WHETHER HE'S FINISHED IN EUROPE, BUT
[1:04:09] THEN HE COMES BACK HERE. LISTEN, WHETHER
[1:04:11] OR NOT THE HOLY GHOST CAME DOWN AND
[1:04:14] CLEANED UP YOUR LIFE AND BROUGHT YOU
[1:04:15] INTO THE PHONE, DON'T THINK SATAN WON'T
[1:04:18] TRY A RESURGENCE.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; DON'T THINK HE'LL JUST GO AWAY QUIETLY
[1:04:22] AND SAY, "OH, I LOST ANOTHER ONE." HE'LL
[1:04:24] CHASE YOU AND HOUND YOU AND TEMPT YOU.
[1:04:26] WHAT'S HE TRYING TO DO? HE'S TRYING TO
[1:04:28] BRING YOU BACK UNDER HIS CONTROL.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "I GOT THE HOLY GHOST." BUT
[1:04:34] YOU'VE GOT TO EMPLOY THE Holy Ghost
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; first of all. YOU GOT TO FEED THE HOLY
[1:04:37] GHOST. MAKE HIM STRONG. AMEN.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; He feeds on the word. [clears throat]
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; So you needn't THINK THAT HE JUST
[1:04:45] BECAUSE THE HOLY SPIRIT CLEANS YOU UP
[1:04:46] THAT SATAN WILL SOMEHOW GO AWAY IN QUIET
[1:04:49] DEFEAT.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO THIS IS A RESURGENT BABYLON, NOT
[1:04:54] THE OLD BABYLON. UH AND AND SO BY BY THE
[1:04:59] TIME THE THE BABYLON COMES ON THE SCENE
[1:05:01] THAT WE'RE REFERRING TO HERE,
[1:05:04] UM YOU KNOW, GOD HAS GOT IT ON THE
[1:05:06] CALENDAR.
[1:05:08] SO, IT'S IMPORTANT that your life follow
[1:05:14] prophecy.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU BE the living
[1:05:18] WORD
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; CUZ THAT'S THE ONLY LIFE THAT COUNTS.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; As far as God is concerned, it's the
[1:05:25] only LIFE THAT THAT THAT he he IS HE'S
[1:05:29] MOVING ACCORDING TO PROPHECY. SO, I I'VE
[1:05:33] GOT SOME EXAMPLES I'LL GET TO HERE. BUT
[1:05:35] BUT BUT YOU REALIZE THEN THAT THAT AND
[1:05:38] AND NOW, OF COURSE, I WANT TO MAKE THIS
[1:05:39] I WANT TO SAY THIS. I'M NOT SAYING THAT
[1:05:42] all those lives of old Babylon weren't
[1:05:46] precious TO GOD BECAUSE THE BIBLE TELLS
[1:05:48] US THAT ALL LIFE is precious to God. SO,
[1:05:51] I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY DON'T COUNT,
[1:05:53] BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO
[1:05:54] UNDERSTAND IS THAT GOD MOVES DIRECTLY ON
[1:05:58] THE SCENE WHEN TIME MEETS PROPHECY FROM
[1:06:01] HIS WORD. I MEAN, HE CAME TO ABRAHAM
[1:06:06] FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN WHEN
[1:06:09] THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH AND DISCERN THE
[1:06:11] SECRETS OF SARAH'S HEART. HE DIDN'T DO
[1:06:12] THAT IN CHAPTER 12 OR CHAPTER 13 OR 14
[1:06:15] OR 15 BECAUSE THAT WASN'T ON THE
[1:06:17] CALENDAR OF PROPHECY. BUT WHEN THE WHEN
[1:06:20] TIME MET PROPHECY, HE CAME WALKING TO
[1:06:22] ABRAHAM IN THE COOL OF THE DAY.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T COME TO MOSES. MOSES TRIED TO
[1:06:28] OPERATE BECAUSE WHAT HIS MOTHER TOLD
[1:06:29] HIM, YOU'RE A SPECIAL CHILD. YOU'RE
[1:06:31] GOING TO BE A DELIVERER. HE TRIED TO
[1:06:32] MAKE THAT WORK, IT DIDN'T WORK. HE HAD
[1:06:34] TO RUN INTO THE WILDERNESS. BUT WHEN
[1:06:36] TIME MET PROPHECY AND HE'S WALKING DOWN
[1:06:39] A PATH AND SUDDENLY HE HEARS THE SOUND
[1:06:41] OF A CRACKLING FLAME. NOW [screaming]
[1:06:43] GOD IS ON THE SCENE. YES. Praise God.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; HE CAME TO JOHN IN THE EXACT SAME WAY
[1:06:49] WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR THE ONE TO COME
[1:06:50] FROM THE WILDERNESS. HE CAME TO AN UPPER
[1:06:53] ROOM
[1:06:54] ON EXACTLY THE 50TH DAY
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; OF SHABBAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE FEAST OF
[1:07:00] PENTECOST. 50 DAYS EXACTLY AFTER THE
[1:07:02] PASSOVER AND AND FROM THE TIME HE'S MADE
[1:07:05] A SACRIFICE AND RISES FROM THE TOMB 50
[1:07:08] DAYS LATER ON PENTECOST GOD COMES DOWN
[1:07:11] ON THE SCENE TO DO WHAT? TO DO WHAT?
[1:07:14] MAKE [screaming] HIS WORD LIVE.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; I'M GLAD HE CAME TO THE SEVEN CHURCH AGE
[1:07:24] MESSENGERS.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU GLAD FOR THAT?
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T COME EARLY. HE DIDN'T COME
[1:07:28] LATE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, HE HAS COME
[1:07:30] TO THE BRIDE HERE AT THE END OF THE LAST
[1:07:33] AGE TO DO WHAT? TO CREATE IN HER? A
[1:07:36] VOICE FOR THE LAST AGE.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; A VOICE FOR THE FINAL AGE. YOU DIDN'T DO
[1:07:41] IT YOURSELF. YOU CAN'T BECOME THAT. GOD
[1:07:43] [screaming] HAS COME ON THE SCENE
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; TO TO CREATE IN YOU A VOICE OF THE FINAL
[1:07:51] AGE.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; I think I've made my point. I want to
[1:07:56] move on.
[1:07:59] SATAN
[1:08:00] WATCHES FOR THESE TIMES.
[1:08:05] That's why he
[1:08:08] THAT HE THAT'S WHY HE ALREADY HAS THE
[1:08:12] ENTIRE world under his control.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; But he won't leave you alone.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; That's why BECAUSE HE ALSO WATCHES FOR
[1:08:23] THESE TIMES. HE ALSO HE WASN'T SURE THAT
[1:08:26] JESUS WAS THE ONE. IF YOU ARE, IF YOU
[1:08:29] ARE, IF YOU ARE. AND HE GOES ALL THE WAY
[1:08:31] TO CALVARY AND HE FINALLY SIGNS OFF ON
[1:08:34] DEATH TO TAKE HIM. ALL RIGHT. HERE.
[1:08:36] YEAH. LET ME SIGN LET ME SIGN THE
[1:08:37] EXECUTION ORDER. HE'S NOT the one. Don't
[1:08:38] worry about it. Take him. Big mistake.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; OH, HOW HE'D like to undo THAT BECAUSE
[1:08:44] BECAUSE OF THE HOW HE'D LIKE TO UNDO
[1:08:46] THOSE STRIPES THAT HEAL YOUR BODY.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE CAN'T UNDO IT. AND IF
[1:08:51] YOU'RE SICK, YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY BY
[1:08:53] HIS STRIPES, I AM HEALED.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; HOW HE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE BACK DEATH.
[1:08:57] BECAUSE IF HE COULD TAKE BACK DEATH, HE
[1:08:59] TAKES BACK A RESURRECTION. HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:01] BUT I'M GLAD JESUS [screaming] DIED AND
[1:09:03] HE ROSE AND HE ASCENDED AND HE CAME DOWN
[1:09:06] INTO HIS CHURCH.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; AND HERE WE ARE AT THE END TIME AND
[1:09:10] SATAN HAS BEEN WATCHING ALL ALONG LIKE
[1:09:12] YOU HAVE.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; He's very KEEN TO THE SCRIPTURES. HE'S A
[1:09:17] HE'S A THEOLOGIAN OF THEOLOGIANS. HE
[1:09:19] WATCHES IT.
[1:09:22] You see, HE HE HAS THE WHOLE WORLD. HE'S
[1:09:24] THE GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE.
[1:09:26] THIS IS FULLY SATAN'S EDEN. NOW, HE'S
[1:09:28] HAD 6,000 YEARS. JUST LIKE GOD TOOK
[1:09:31] 6,000 years
[1:09:34] to BUILD HIS EDEN. SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:09:38] SHOWS THAT NOW GOD HAS GIVEN Satan
[1:09:43] 6,000 years.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; These are things that make our day
[1:09:48] unique.
[1:09:50] You see, we don't have a different
[1:09:52] message than Paul. WE CERTAINLY DON'T
[1:09:54] HAVE A GREATER REVELATION THAN PAUL,
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; BUT IN PAUL'S DAY, THAT CHURCH HAD TO GO
[1:09:59] INTO THE GROUND
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; FOR ONE REASON, BECAUSE THE SEED HAD TO
[1:10:03] GO INTO THE GROUND AND DIE TO BRING
[1:10:04] FORTH.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; BUT IT ALSO ACCOMPLISHED GOD'S
[1:10:08] PROPERNESS AND THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T
[1:10:10] TRY TO TAKE SATAN OUT WHEN HE'S ONLY HAD
[1:10:12] 4,000 YEARS.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; He's going to GIVE HIM THE FULL 6,000
[1:10:16] YEARS. HE'S GOING TO ALLOW HIM. HE'S
[1:10:18] GOING TO ALLOW SATAN TO GO BACK INTO THE
[1:10:20] DUST BIN OF HISTORY AND PULL OUT HIS
[1:10:23] ANTIDOLUVIAN PLAYBOOK AND GO INTO
[1:10:25] ANOTHER DUST BIN OF HISTORY AND PULL OUT
[1:10:27] HIS SODOM AND GOMORRAH PLAYBOOK AND HE'S
[1:10:30] GOING TO MASH HIM UP AND HAVE AI WRITE
[1:10:32] HIM ONE BIG MANUAL AND HE'S GOING TO
[1:10:33] COME AFTER THE BRIDE. I'M HERE TO TELL
[1:10:35] YOU THE WORD OF GOD IS MORE THAN A MATCH
[1:10:38] FOR HIM AND THE BRIDE OF CHRIST IS MORE
[1:10:40] THAN A MATCH FOR HIM. AND THE REASON HE
[1:10:42] HAS THE WHOLE WORLD AND WON'T LEAVE YOU
[1:10:44] ALONE IS BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONLY THING
[1:10:46] HE FEARS.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THAT YOU ARE THE ONLY OBSTACLE
[1:10:51] TO HIM BEING ABLE TO ASCEND THE THRONE.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S HOW GOD HAS
[1:10:56] [screaming] ORDAINED THE PLAN OF
[1:10:58] REDEMPTION.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; TO BE PLAYED OUT IN MY LIFE, YOUR LIFE.
[1:11:02] THAT'S HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE GOD HAS IN
[1:11:04] YOU.
[1:11:05] AMEN.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus is not coming back to suffer the
[1:11:13] penalty of sin again.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; AND THAT HE DIED, HE DIETH NO MORE.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; SEE, HIS CONFIDENCE IS SO GREAT THAT HE
[1:11:23] ALREADY KNOWS ALL HE HAS TO DO IS COME
[1:11:26] ON THE SCENE AND HIS FAMILY WILL hear
[1:11:29] the certain sound.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; THEY WON'T LISTEN TO AN UNCERTAIN SOUND.
[1:11:33] MY SHEEP KNOW MY VOICE. NO, NO, NO.
[1:11:36] THAT'S MAN-MADE. I DON'T WANT NOTHING TO
[1:11:38] DO WITH THAT. OH, BUT WHEN YOU HEAR WHEN
[1:11:41] YOU HEAR RECOGNIZING YOUR DAY AND ITS
[1:11:43] MESSAGE, SUDDENLY, OH, THAT'S MUSIC TO
[1:11:46] MY EARS.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE HIS ONLY OBSTACLE.
[1:11:54] YOU'RE THE ONLY THING THAT THREATENS
[1:11:55] HIM. YEAH.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; OH, I wish
[1:11:59] I wish that we could IN MOMENTS WHEN THE
[1:12:02] ENEMY COMES IN LIKE A FLOOD MAKES US
[1:12:06] TRIES TO MAKE US FEARFUL.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; SYMPTOMS OF THIS AND PROBLEMS WITH THAT
[1:12:10] AND EPISODES OF THIS AND UH THIS KIND OF
[1:12:13] A A THING GOING ON AND THAT GOING ON
[1:12:16] UNTIL IT JUST SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:12:18] BE SWALLOWED UP AND BURIED OVER BY THE
[1:12:21] WAVES AND AND REMEMBER THEY TRIED THAT
[1:12:23] ON JESUS. OH, BUT IF YOU COULD REALIZE
[1:12:26] THAT SATAN IS DOING THAT BECAUSE YOU
[1:12:28] THREATENED HIM. AND IF YOU COULD STAND
[1:12:30] UP LIKE JESUS DID IN THE BOAT AND SAY,
[1:12:33] "PEACE, BE STILL. I AM IN CHARGE HERE.
[1:12:37] I'M THE SON OF GOD. I'M THE ONE WITH THE
[1:12:39] WORD ON MY LIPS. IF I SPEAK, THAT'S LIKE
[1:12:42] GOD SPEAKING."
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT SATAN IS AFRAID. HE'S
[1:12:47] AFRAID YOU WILL RECOGNIZE
[1:12:50] WHO YOU ARE AND THAT YOU CAN DO THE
[1:12:52] MIGHTY WORKS BECAUSE HE KNOWS IF YOU
[1:12:54] RECOGNIZE THAT YOU [screaming]
[1:12:56] BECOME AN INVINCIBLE ARMY AND HE WILL
[1:12:59] NEVER GET HIS THRONE.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; HE'S AFRAID OF YOU, NOT THE OTHER WAY
[1:13:06] AROUND.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; SO THE ANCIENT BABYLON
[1:13:16] CEASES TO EXIST. THE MEO PERSIANS TAKE
[1:13:18] IT, [sighs]
[1:13:21] but you can't
[1:13:23] you you can't end or kill the Antichrist
[1:13:28] spirit.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; They ended that nation as a world power,
[1:13:34] BUT YOU CAN'T KILL THE ANTICHRIST
[1:13:36] SPIRIT.
[1:13:37] And so it IT IT SURVIVES. IT CONTINUES
[1:13:42] TO DOMINATE THE WORLD THROUGH SUCCESSIVE
[1:13:45] EMPIRES, THROUGH THE MEO PERSIAN EMPIRE,
[1:13:48] THROUGH THE GRECIAN EMPIRE. DANIEL LAID
[1:13:50] IT ALL OUT IN PROPHECY VERY CLEARLY. It
[1:13:52] all fits perfectly. BUT FINALLY, DANIEL
[1:13:56] AFTER HE IS ABLE TO DISCERN THREE
[1:14:00] DISTINCT ANIMALS THAT ARE VERY CLEAR.
[1:14:04] THEY'RE THEY'RE QUITE NATURAL. HE CAN
[1:14:06] SEE, YOU KNOW, HE KNOWS WHAT A LION IS.
[1:14:08] HE KNOWS WHAT AN EAGLE IS. HE KNOWS WHAT
[1:14:10] A BEAR IS. HE KNOWS WHAT A LEOPARD IS.
[1:14:11] HE'S GOT HE HE UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THESE
[1:14:14] THINGS, YOU UNDERSTAND? HE KNOWS WHAT A
[1:14:15] RAM IS. HE KNOWS WHAT A GOAT IS. DANIEL
[1:14:17] HAD NO TROUBLE IDENTIFYING THOSE THINGS.
[1:14:21] AND THEN suddenly
[1:14:23] he comes to a creature and it's like
[1:14:27] I don't know.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; I never seen anything like that.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; What does he look like, Daniel? WELL,
[1:14:31] HE'S HE'S TERRIBLE. HE'S GOT IRON TEETH
[1:14:35] AND HE'S BIG AND HE'S VERY FIERCE AND
[1:14:38] SCARY. OH, SURELY HE WON'T BE ABLE TO
[1:14:41] WITHSTAND UH THE OTHER BEAST. HE
[1:14:44] ANNIHILATES THEM.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; HE TAKES OVER THE WHOLE WORLD AND RUNS
[1:14:49] ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE END TIME.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:53] SO IT'S OBVIOUS THEN THAT IT REEMERGES
[1:14:56] LATER IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE AND AND AND
[1:14:59] THEN THAT FROM POLITICAL TO PAPEL AND
[1:15:02] THEN AT THE END TIME THE BOOK OF
[1:15:04] REVELATION WOULD IDENTIFY IT AS A
[1:15:07] WORLDWIDE CHURCH.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. known as Revelation 17:5,
[1:15:14] known as mystery Babylon, the great, the
[1:15:18] mother of harlots AND ABOMINATIONS
[1:15:23] OF the earth.
[1:15:25] SO IT'S CLEAR THAT HE HAS NOW COME ALONG
[1:15:31] AND THAT SPIRIT OF ANTICHRIST IS NOW
[1:15:33] WORKING IN A CHURCH THAT HAS GLOBAL
[1:15:35] INFLUENCE ALONG WITH ALL OF HER UH YOU
[1:15:40] KNOW NOT NOT NOT ONLY NOT YOU KNOW IT'S
[1:15:42] IT'S ALONG WITH ALL OF HER HIS HER
[1:15:44] OFFSPRING
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS IT'S NOT JUST HER
[1:15:48] BUT SHE'S THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS. SO SHE
[1:15:51] HAS DAUGHTERS.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THOSE ARE ALSO CHURCHES. AND
[1:15:56] THAT AND THAT'S WHY GOD HATES ORGANIZED
[1:15:58] RELIGION. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY LUCIFER
[1:16:00] LOVES ORGANIZED RELIGION.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; HE LOVES ORGANIZED RELIGION BECAUSE
[1:16:06] ORGANIZED RELIGION IS CONTROLLED BY MEN.
[1:16:08] AND ALL HE'S GOT TO DO IS GET IN THE MEN
[1:16:11] AND THEN HE CAN RUIN THE WORLD. I'M GLAD
[1:16:14] THAT GOD SENDS THE HOLY GHOST TO LEAD
[1:16:16] HIS CHURCH. AND IF A MAN WON'T FOLLOW
[1:16:18] THE HOLY GHOST, GOD WILL RAISE UP
[1:16:20] ANOTHER ONE WHO WILL FOLLOW THE HOLY
[1:16:22] GHOST.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, THE HOLY GHOST
[1:16:25] WILL NOT BE DEFEATED. HE HAS NEVER BEEN
[1:16:28] DEFEATED. HE WILL NOT BE DEFEATED. HE
[1:16:30] HAS MADE A CLAIM [screaming]
[1:16:32] AND HE'S GOING TO SEE IT THROUGH.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; HE GOES FORTH IN ORGANIZED RELIGION. WE
[1:16:40] CAN SEE THAT IN DANIEL AND REVELATION
[1:16:42] VERY CLEARLY. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO teach
[1:16:43] on it today. BY EXTENSION, HE RULES ALL
[1:16:47] NATIONS AND PEOPLES OF THE EARTH WHO
[1:16:49] ACCORDING TO THE BOOK OF REVELATION ARE
[1:16:51] KNOWN BECAUSE THEY WORSHIP HER IMAGE.
[1:16:54] THEY TAKE HIS MARK AND THEY GO DOWN WITH
[1:16:57] HIM IN THE TRIBULATION.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; THE TRIBULATION PERIOD, THE BIBLE SPEAKS
[1:17:05] OF IT AS A TIME LIKE THE WORLD HAS NEVER
[1:17:07] SEEN.
[1:17:09] IN A MERE THREE AND A HALF YEARS,
[1:17:12] IT ENDS ALL LIFE ON THE EARTH.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; That's quite a three and a half years.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; There's [snorts] been some very
[1:17:23] impactful
[1:17:25] GENOCIDAL
[1:17:26] ARMIES that have swept the world,
[1:17:29] conquered, POURED PEOPLE BY THE MILLIONS
[1:17:32] INTO GRAVES, AND THE ONES THAT LIVE WENT
[1:17:35] INTO SLAVERY. IN AND AND THIS HAS BEEN
[1:17:38] GOING ON UH TIME IMMEMORIAL SINCE SINCE
[1:17:41] TIME BEGAN
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; SINCE SINCE NIMROD WAS THE FIRST ONE TO
[1:17:47] CARRY WAR TO HIS neighbors
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; because that spirit of antichrist see
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; and so SO WE FIND NIMROD CARRIES WAR TO
[1:17:56] HIS NEIGHBORS COMING OUT OF THE flood
[1:17:59] so it SO THREE AND A HALF YEARS BRINGS
[1:18:01] TO A GRUESOME END 6,000 YEARS OF mire
[1:18:06] and filth, of sin,
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; WITH ALL NATURE GROANING TO BE FREE. ALL
[1:18:13] THE TRIBULATION ENDED A STATE OF
[1:18:15] SINFULNESS AND PERVERSION THAT HAS BEEN
[1:18:18] UNPARALLELED IN HISTORY, EVEN MORE THAN
[1:18:21] THE DAYS OF NOAH, EVEN MORE THAN THE
[1:18:24] DAYS OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH. AND IN FACT
[1:18:26] IS WHEN WE READ IT FROM THE BIBLE, WE
[1:18:28] FIND THAT IT ALL CONCLUDED
[1:18:31] AS A DARKNESS THAT covered the whole
[1:18:35] world.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; A blindness
[1:18:43] AND AN INSANITY.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; GO READ ISAIAH 60. A DARKNESS THAT
[1:18:50] COVERS THE WHOLE WORLD AND A GROSS
[1:18:52] DARKNESS, A BLINDNESS AND INSANITY SO
[1:18:56] DEEP THAT THAT THAT BEGINS TO CONTROL
[1:19:00] THE MINDS AND AND AND IT INFECTS THE
[1:19:02] MINDS OF PEOPLE AND IT LITERALLY
[1:19:05] ACCORDING TO PROPHECY
[1:19:07] REACHES ALL CORNERS OF CIVILIZATION.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be here.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; I want an exodus.
[1:19:17] I'm looking for a third exodus.
[1:19:22] All nature groaning.
[1:19:27] A blindness AND INSANITY
[1:19:30] THAT IN FACT IS IS RUNS SO deep that
[1:19:34] literally this beast system.
[1:19:38] YOU'LL FIND THAT WHEN THE BRIDE IS GONE,
[1:19:40] WHATEVER RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE ARE LEFT ON
[1:19:43] THE earth are ACTUALLY A BLINDNESS
[1:19:46] OVERTAKES SOCIETY TO THE DEGREE THAT
[1:19:49] THEY HUNT THEM DOWN LIKE DOGS
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; AND PUT THEM TO DEATH TO THE LAST MAN.
[1:19:55] AMEN.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; ALL WHO WOULD NOT BOW the knee after the
[1:20:02] bride has been taken in the rapture IN
[1:20:05] THE SHORT SPACE OF 42 months the world
[1:20:09] WOULD WITNESS. THINK ABOUT THIS. I
[1:20:12] CHANGED THIS SENTENCE SEVERAL TIMES FOR
[1:20:14] THE IMPACT I WANT IT TO HAVE ON YOU. IN
[1:20:17] JUST A SHORT SPACE OF 42 MONTHS, THIS IS
[1:20:20] HOW DEEP THE BLINDNESS GOES. THIS IS HOW
[1:20:24] PERVASIVE THE BLINDNESS IS. THAT IN JUST
[1:20:27] THE SPACE, THE SHORT SPACE OF 42 MONTHS,
[1:20:31] THE WORLD WILL WITNESS A COMPLETE
[1:20:35] EXTERMINATION
[1:20:37] OF ALL remaining righteous peoples,
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; INCLUDING
[1:20:45] AND NOT LIMITED TO THE ENTIRETY OF THE
[1:20:49] UNWISE VIRGIN WHO WILL NOT WORSHIP HIM.
[1:20:52] AMEN.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; THE TRUE THE TWO GREAT PROPHETS OF GOD,
[1:20:56] MOSES AND ELIJAH, AND THE ENTIRE
[1:21:01] 144,000 ELECTED JEWS
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; IN 42 MONTHS.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; THE COMPLETE EXTERMINATION. YOU'RE
[1:21:09] TALKING ABOUT A GENOCIDE. THEY THREW
[1:21:11] THAT WORD AROUND TODAY. IT'S JUST A
[1:21:12] POLITICAL TERM. THIS IS GENOCIDE FOR
[1:21:14] REAL.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; WHERE IMAGINE LIVING IN A WORLD, NO
[1:21:18] WONDER GOD'S GOING TO DESTROY IT. IT
[1:21:20] WON'T HAVE ONE SINGLE SOLITARY RIGHTEOUS
[1:21:23] PERSON LEFT ALIVE.
[1:21:29] If you think the world can't get more
[1:21:31] crazy, you'd be wrong.
[1:21:34] Lastly,
[1:21:36] AND FINALLY,
[1:21:38] AT THE END OF THE MILLENNIUM, NOW WE'RE
[1:21:40] IN THE THIRD. WE HAD, you know, Babylon
[1:21:44] the ANCIENT DESTROYED AND THEN HE GOES
[1:21:47] THROUGH THE OTHER KINGDOMS AND HE ENDS
[1:21:49] UP IN Rome and HE BUILDS HIS IMAGE HERE
[1:21:53] IN REVELATION 13 UNITED STATES HERE.
[1:21:56] THEY HAVE AN IMAGE AND THEY CONTROL THE
[1:21:57] WORLD THROUGH COMMERCE. THEY DESTROY ALL
[1:22:00] OF THE RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE. AND LASTLY,
[1:22:03] THIRDLY, FINALLY AT THE THEN WE THEN OF
[1:22:06] COURSE AFTER THE TRIBULATION, WE GO INTO
[1:22:08] THE MILLENNIUM. AND THEN AT THE END OF
[1:22:09] THE millennium
[1:22:11] uh AND YOU HAVE THE GREAT WHITE THRONE
[1:22:13] JUDGMENT WHERE THE FINAL SENTENCE OF
[1:22:17] EVERYTHING IS CARRIED out and the BEAST
[1:22:21] AND THE FALSE PROPHET ARE CONSUMED IN
[1:22:24] THE LAKE OF FIRE
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; AND THEY ARE CAST IN WITH DEATH AND
[1:22:28] HELL. HALLELUJAH. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
[1:22:31] DEATH AND HELL WHEN ONCE THAT'S CAST IN
[1:22:33] AND ALL THINGS THAT WERE NOT PART OF THE
[1:22:36] ORIGINAL WORD ARE CONSUMED FOREVER. AND
[1:22:39] THEN JOHN SAYS, I SAW A NEW HEAVEN
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; AND A NEW EARTH. HALLELUJAH. AND GOD
[1:22:46] HIMSELF DWELLING WITH MAN.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; THE GREAT GOD OF CREATION. THINK ABOUT
[1:22:53] THAT FRIENDS. THE GREAT GOD OF CREATION,
[1:22:56] THE WHO SPOKE INTO EXISTENCE EVERYTHING
[1:22:59] BY HIS WORD AND NOW HE'S IN HIS
[1:23:02] COMPLETENESS THROUGHOUT ALL CREATION
[1:23:05] FROM THERE going forward.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER EVEN JUST A FEW
[1:23:11] WEEKS AGO and I was AND I I WAS
[1:23:14] CONFESSING TO YOU, YOU KNOW, WHEN I GET
[1:23:16] TO REVELATION 21 AND GOD HIMSELF SHALL
[1:23:20] DWELL AND I AND AND BE ON THE EARTH AND
[1:23:22] HE SHALL DWELL WITH MAN. AND I SAID TO
[1:23:24] YOU, IT'S THE ONLY PLACE IN THE BIBLE.
[1:23:26] IT DOESN'T SAY THAT ANYWHERE. IT'S AND
[1:23:28] and and I was, YOU KNOW, TRYING AND I
[1:23:30] THOUGHT, IT'S JUST CLOUDY. IT SEEMS
[1:23:31] MYSTERIOUS TO ME. I CAN'T SEEM TO PUT IT
[1:23:33] ALL TOGETHER. WHY IS IT THAT SOMETHING
[1:23:35] IS HAPPENING THERE UNDER A NEW HEAVENS
[1:23:37] AND A NEW EARTH THAT HASN'T EXACTLY BEEN
[1:23:39] TO THAT LEVEL? AND SO, SO WE REALIZE
[1:23:42] THAT AND AND AS I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT
[1:23:44] THAT, THEN I REMEMBERED AND I WAS
[1:23:46] STUDYING AND I THOUGHT, MY GOODNESS, how
[1:23:49] how childish. I REALIZED BROTHER
[1:23:51] BRANDHAM GAVE ME THE PERFECT CLUE AND
[1:23:53] LITERALLY SPELLED THE WHOLE THING OUT SO
[1:23:55] THAT IT JUST SUDDENLY MAKES SENSE TO ME.
[1:23:58] All right, you you with me?
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; YOU GIVE ME ANOTHER 15 MINUTES.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; HEY, I used UP SOME OF MY TIMES FOR
[1:24:04] ANNOUNCEMENTS. THAT DON'T COUNT.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Y'all haven't this. Y'all have like four
[1:24:10] services without me, so I should be able
[1:24:12] to preach double.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:24:17] SO, SO WE FIND THEN NOW THAT THIS GOD OF
[1:24:21] CREATION,
[1:24:23] THE SAME ONE WHO SPOKE IT ALL INTO
[1:24:25] EXISTENCE BY HIS WORD. SO IT SO WHEN
[1:24:28] WHEN WE I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT WHEN
[1:24:32] WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE REASON I
[1:24:35] SEEM MYSTERIOUS I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE
[1:24:36] OUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK like because
[1:24:40] OKAY [clears throat] HE'S A SPIRIT BUT
[1:24:41] THEN THERE'S JESUS AND THEN IF HE'S I
[1:24:44] MEAN HOW THEN THE PILLAR OF FIRE AND
[1:24:45] BROTHER BRANDHAM MAKES SOME SOME
[1:24:47] STATEMENTS AND IF YOU DON'T TIE THEM ALL
[1:24:48] TOGETHER THEN THEY CAN BE SOMEWHAT
[1:24:50] CONFUSING. IT DIDN'T IT DOESN'T STOP MY
[1:24:52] SALVATION. DOESN'T GOING TO STOP ME FROM
[1:24:53] GOING TO THE RAPTURE. BUT I JUST I JUST
[1:24:55] THOUGHT TO MYSELF THERE THERE'S
[1:24:56] SOMETHING LAYING THERE. I'M SURE. AND AS
[1:24:59] I BEGIN TO PONDER THAT, I REALIZE IT'S
[1:25:01] NOT ABOUT FIGURING OUT WHAT THAT FULLY
[1:25:04] LOOKS LIKE. YOU KNOW, HIS FORM or or
[1:25:06] WHAT FORM THAT IS OR HOW IT RELATES TO
[1:25:08] JESUS. BUT BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO NOTICE
[1:25:11] IS FIRST THING, LET ME GIVE YOU THIS
[1:25:13] CLUE IS THAT IT'S HIS PLAN OF REDEMPTION
[1:25:17] IS NOW FULFILLED.
[1:25:19] SO HIS PEOPLE, ALL THE NAMES IN THE
[1:25:23] LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE ARE REDEEMED.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; The earth is redeemed.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; EVERY PROMISE IS NOW MADE GOOD.
[1:25:33] SATAN HAS BEEN DESTROYED. DEATH AND HELL
[1:25:36] HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. A NEW HEAVENS AND A
[1:25:39] NEW EARTH ARE NOW UNDERWAY.
[1:25:42] AND GOD HIMSELF, ALL OF HIS CHARACTER,
[1:25:46] ALL OF HIS, AS BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID,
[1:25:48] ALL OF HIS CHARACTERISTICS, HIS
[1:25:51] REDEMPTIVE NAMES, ALL OF THOSE
[1:25:54] REDEMPTIVE NAMES, JEHOVAH GYRA, JEHOVAH
[1:25:56] RAFA, JEHOVAH SHALOM. AMEN.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; SO JEHOVAH NISSI, JEHOVAH SID CANOE, ALL
[1:26:03] OF THESE THINGS ARE ARE ARE ARE NAMES
[1:26:07] THAT GOD THEY IDENTIFIED A
[1:26:09] CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM. JEHOVAH GYRA, THE
[1:26:11] LORD PROVIDES. JEHOVAH RAFA, THE LORD
[1:26:13] HEALS. AMEN. SO JEHOVAH SHALOM, HE IS
[1:26:16] OUR PEACE. JEHOVAH NISSI, HE'S OUR
[1:26:18] CAPTAIN. ALL RIGHT. SO, SO WE FIND THEN
[1:26:21] THAT NOW WHEN WE COME INTO THE NEW
[1:26:23] HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH, ALL THE NAMES
[1:26:25] ARE CALLED. ALL REDEMPTION IS FINISHED.
[1:26:28] ALL OF HIS REDEMPTIVE NAMES ARE NOW ON
[1:26:32] FULL DISPLAY. SEE, NOW BROTHER BRANDON
[1:26:35] PICKS THIS UP. WATCH THIS. HE DISTILLS
[1:26:37] IT PERFECTLY IN describing
[1:26:41] the progressive expression of Christ.
[1:26:45] CHRIST IS THE MYSTERY OF GOD REVEALED.
[1:26:48] HE SAYS, "BUT NOW YOU GET IT." HE WANTED
[1:26:52] TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. THAT WAS HIS ONE OF
[1:26:55] HIS GREATEST THREE-FOLD purposes
[1:26:59] was to EXPRESS HIMSELF, IDENTIFY HIMSELF
[1:27:03] WITH HUMAN BEINGS.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:06] to reveal himself in Christ. FIRST, TO
[1:27:10] EXPRESS HIMSELF COMPLETELY, GOD IN
[1:27:13] CHRIST. SECOND, TO HAVE THE PREEMINENCE
[1:27:16] BY THIS in his church. See, now we're in
[1:27:19] the era of the Holy Ghost. He's got
[1:27:21] preeminence in his church. He had
[1:27:22] preeminence in Christ.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; HE PORTRAYED HIM IN ALL THE OLD
[1:27:26] TESTAMENT. AND THEN Jesus was a
[1:27:28] fulfillment OF ALL THAT. THAT'S WHY WHEN
[1:27:29] HE ROSE, THEY all rose. SEE? AND SO NOW
[1:27:32] HE COMES INTO HIS CHURCH BECAUSE HE'S
[1:27:34] GOT ANOTHER EXODUS COMING. THAT WAS THE
[1:27:36] SECOND EXODUS. MOSES WAS THE FIRST ONE.
[1:27:38] HIS RESURRECTION WAS THE SECOND ONE. BUT
[1:27:40] THERE'S A THIRD EXODUS THAT COMES 2,000
[1:27:42] YEARS LATER.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND SO SO WE FIND THEN HE
[1:27:46] SAYS, "SO SECONDLY,
[1:27:48] FIRST TO EXPRESS HIMSELF COMPLETELY, GOD
[1:27:50] IN CHRIST. SECOND TO HAVE THE
[1:27:52] PREEMINENCE BY THIS IN HIS CHURCH WHICH
[1:27:55] IS HIS BODY THE BRIDE TILL HE COULD HAVE
[1:27:58] THE PREEMINENCE TO EXPRESS HIMSELF
[1:28:00] THROUGH THEM.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; All right. AND THIRDLY TO RESTORE THE
[1:28:05] KINGDOM TO ITS RIGHTLY POSITION THAT
[1:28:08] FELL BY SIN BY THE FIRST ADAM BACK TO
[1:28:11] WHERE HE WALKED IN THE COOL OF THE
[1:28:12] EVENING WITH HIS PEOPLE TALKED WITH THEM
[1:28:15] FELLOWSHIPPED WITH THEM. I'M HERE TO
[1:28:17] TELL YOU SOMETHING FRIENDS. HE'S TRYING
[1:28:18] TO GET BACK TO THAT PLACE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:21] GOD HIMSELF CAN COME DOWN. NOW THE HOLY
[1:28:24] GHOST CAN LIVE IN YOU, BUT JESUS FEET
[1:28:28] CAN'T CAN'T TOUCH CAN'T DON'T TOUCH THE
[1:28:30] GROUND. WE MEET HIM IN THE AIR.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AND AND SO THAT'S WHY
[1:28:35] JESUS CAN JESUS CAN WALK AROUND WITH US
[1:28:38] IN THE MILLENNIUM. BUT BUT THERE'S STILL
[1:28:40] ANOTHER EXPRESSION COMING. IT'S THE SAME
[1:28:43] GOD AT A GREATER EXPRESSION BECAUSE NOW
[1:28:46] THE EARTH HAS BEEN REDEEMED. NOW GOD CAN
[1:28:49] COME DOWN AND PUT HIS FULL FEET, HIS
[1:28:52] FULL EXPRESSION BACK ON THE EARTH AGAIN.
[1:28:55] HE'S GOT A REDEEMED PEOPLE. HE'S GOT A
[1:28:57] REDEEMED [screaming] EARTH. HE'S GOT A
[1:28:58] REDEEMED HEAVENS. HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; SO HE SAYS, "SO HE FOR TO THE GARDEN IN
[1:29:07] THE COOL OF THE EVENING WITH HIS PEOPLE
[1:29:09] TALKED WITH HIM, FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM.
[1:29:10] AND NOW NOW FOR RIGHT NOW SIN AND DEATH
[1:29:12] HAD SEPARATED THEM FROM HIS PRESENCE AND
[1:29:15] HIS ENTIRE EXPRESSION."
[1:29:17] HE SAYS THEN WHAT IS IT? It's now listen
[1:29:20] to this. This is real definitive. WHAT
[1:29:23] IS IT? WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? God in
[1:29:26] expression.
[1:29:27] It's Christ being revealed.
[1:29:30] AND HE IS THE WORD. And when THE WORD IS
[1:29:34] REVEALED, IT EXPRESSES ITSELF.
[1:29:38] THAT'S GOD'S PURPOSE FOR JESUS CHRIST
[1:29:41] WAS TO EXPRESS HIMSELF TO TAKE HIS OWN
[1:29:44] laws and live by his own laws, FULFILL
[1:29:46] HIS LAW BY DEATH. AND CHRIST, GOD DIED
[1:29:49] IN FLESH IN ORDER TO CONDEMN SIN IN THE
[1:29:52] FLESH THAT HE MIGHT BRING TO HIMSELF A
[1:29:56] GLORIOUS BRIDE REDEEMED BACK that will
[1:29:59] believe only in the word of God.
[1:30:03] SEE, SO THE WHOLE PURPOSE IS SO THAT AS
[1:30:06] HE SAID HERE, SO THAT HE COULD HAVE THE
[1:30:08] PREEMINENCE TO EXPRESS HIMSELF THROUGH
[1:30:11] THEM. [snorts]
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; SO HE'S EXPRESSING HIMSELF IN THE BRIDE
[1:30:16] OF THE LAST AGE TO DO WHAT? TO BRING
[1:30:20] FORTH A WIFE UNTO HIMSELF. AMEN.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; SEE, NOW YOU KNOW AND THERE AND THERE'S
[1:30:27] A NUANCE TO BE OBSERVED because
[1:30:31] when you WHEN YOU READ ABOUT THE bride
[1:30:34] you LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN IT LIKE THIS
[1:30:36] AND I GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE I
[1:30:37] DON'T WANT to confuse you. SO WHEN YOU
[1:30:40] READ ABOUT THE BRIDE BRIDE DEALS MORE
[1:30:43] WITH ESPOUSAL. PAUL SAID for I have
[1:30:45] espoused you remember to the Corinthians
[1:30:48] for I have espoused you to one husband.
[1:30:51] See, but I fear lest what happened to
[1:30:53] Eve happen to you. SEE? AND SO, SO,
[1:30:57] BROTHER BRANDHAM BREAKS IT DOWN. HE
[1:30:58] SAYS, SEE, when Adam, he was given a
[1:31:02] bride, BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO KNOW HER
[1:31:05] AS A WIFE, HE FOUND SHE HAD ALREADY
[1:31:08] FALLEN.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, THEN JEHOVAH, THE SAME
[1:31:11] THING. ISRAEL WAS A BRIDE FOR JEHOVAH.
[1:31:14] BUT WHEN HE CAME TO HAVE HER THE TO THE
[1:31:17] TO HAVE HIS BETROTHED AS A WIFE, HE
[1:31:20] FOUND THAT SHE HAD ALREADY CHOSEN A KING
[1:31:22] AND REJECTED HIM
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS POLLUTED.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, AND SO THEN WHEN JESUS, YOU
[1:31:28] CATCH IT, BROTHER BRANDHAM DEALS WITH
[1:31:29] THIS. HE SAID, "SO WHEN JESUS CAME, YOU
[1:31:31] KNOW, IN THOSE EARLY YEARS AND HE CAME
[1:31:33] TO RECEIVE A BRIDE AT NIKA TO MAKE HER A
[1:31:37] WIFE
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; TO TO BRING FORTH A MARRIAGE, THEN HE
[1:31:41] FOUND THAT SHE WAS ALREADY POLLUTED.
[1:31:43] AMEN.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; SHE HAD ALREADY FALLEN.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND?
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; SO NOW WHAT MUST HE DO? HE MUST SIT BACK
[1:31:50] DOWN IN THE ETERNITIES, SEAL THE WORD UP
[1:31:52] UNDER SEVEN SEALS, MAKE A PROMISE HE
[1:31:55] WOULD UNVEIL IT AT THE END TIME AND
[1:31:56] START INTERCEDING TO GOD ON BEHALF OF
[1:31:59] THE IGNORANCE OF WHO? HIS FAMILY, HIS
[1:32:01] REDEEMED FAMILY, HIS BRIDE ALL THROUGH
[1:32:04] SEVEN AGES. BUT WE REALIZE IT WAS COMING
[1:32:06] DOWN TO THE END TIME FRIENDS. AND IT
[1:32:09] WASN'T IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T JUST BE
[1:32:10] HIS BRIDE. REVELATION 19:7, "LET US BE
[1:32:13] GLAD AND REJOICE AND GIVE HONOR TO HIM,
[1:32:16] FOR THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB IS COME,
[1:32:18] AND HIS WIFE HATH MADE HERSELF READY."
[1:32:21] HALLELUJAH. REVELATION 21:9, "AND THERE
[1:32:24] CAME UNTO ME ONE OF THE SEVEN ANGELS,
[1:32:25] WHICH HAD THE SEVEN VIALS FULL OF THE
[1:32:27] SEVEN LAST PLAGUES." SO, WE KNOW THIS IS
[1:32:29] OUR DAY
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S THE SEVENTH ANGEL THAT
[1:32:32] CAME WITH WITH MERCY AND WITH JUDGMENT.
[1:32:35] OH, HALLELUJAH. AND IT SAYS HE HE COMES
[1:32:38] AND AND HE SAYS HERE VERSE 9 WHICH HATH
[1:32:41] THE SEVEN VIALS FULL OF THE SEVEN LAST
[1:32:43] PLAGUES AND TALKED WITH ME SAYING COME
[1:32:45] HITHER I WILL SHOW THEE THE BRIDE THE
[1:32:48] LAMB'S WIFE I IS SHE STILL THE BRIDE OF
[1:32:52] COURSE SHE'S HIS BRIDE THE SPIRIT AND
[1:32:55] THE BRIDE SAY COME BUT YOU REALIZE YOU
[1:32:58] HAVE COME TO THE LAST [screaming] TIME
[1:33:00] OF THE LAST AGE AND NOW A BRIDE FOR SICK
[1:33:03] FOR 2,000 YEARS [screaming] THAT HE'S
[1:33:06] AND CALLING THOSE NAMES ON THE ROLL AND
[1:33:08] COMES TO THE END TIME AND BROTHER
[1:33:10] BRANDHAM SAYS [screaming] WE DON'T GO TO
[1:33:12] THE WEDDING SUPPER TO GET MARRIED. WE'RE
[1:33:14] MARRIED RIGHT HERE. IT IS AN INVISIBLE
[1:33:17] UNION [screaming] OF CHRIST AND HIS
[1:33:19] BRIDE AND SHE'S NOW HIS WIFE AND HE
[1:33:22] CALLS HIS QUEEN
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; TO COME AND STAND BY HIS SIDE.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; OH, [screaming] GLORY. HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:30] FRIENDS, THIS IS THE HOUR. THIS IS WHAT
[1:33:32] GOD PROMISED [screaming]
[1:33:34] HIMSELF. AMEN.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; SATAN HAS MADE A COUNTER CLAIM
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; AGAINST GOD'S CLAIM. I'M NOT ASKING YOU
[1:33:43] TODAY. I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS. WHOSE
[1:33:45] CLAIM do you want to be identified
[1:33:47] under?
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Do you WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED UNDER
[1:33:50] MAN-MADE RELIGION? DO YOU WANT TO BE
[1:33:52] IDENTIFIED UNDER SATAN'S ORGANIZED
[1:33:54] RELIGIOSITY THAT HAS A FORM OF GODLINESS
[1:33:56] AND DENIES THE LIVING POWER? I SAY, "NOT
[1:34:00] ME. AS FOR ME IN MY HOUSE, I WANT THE
[1:34:02] WORD, THE WHOLE WORD, AND NOTHING BUT
[1:34:04] THE WORD BECAUSE I'M INVISIBLY. IT IS
[1:34:07] THAT VISIBLE UNION, THAT INVISIBLE UNION
[1:34:10] THAT LITERALLY BRINGS THE SLEEPING
[1:34:12] SAINTS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS [screaming]
[1:34:14] OUT OF THE GRAVE.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE INVISIBLE UNION IS EXACTLY
[1:34:20] THAT. IT UNITES HEAD TO BODY.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT THING
[1:34:25] WHICH WE'VE OPERATED IN A SMALL MEASURE
[1:34:27] AT THAT TIME, IT'LL BE OF FULL POWER.
[1:34:30] AND EVEN EVEN HOW MUCH FULL POWER EVEN
[1:34:32] TO THE DEAD THAT'S BEEN DEAD FOR
[1:34:34] HUNDREDS OF YEARS WILL COME UP OUT OF
[1:34:36] THE GRAVE
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO PART OF THE BRIDE
[1:34:39] WHO ARE NOW HIS WIFE.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH, FRIENDS. GLORY TO
[1:34:44] [screaming] GOD IN THE HIGHEST.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; THIS IS A CLAIM AND A COUNTER CLAIM.
[1:34:53] AMEN.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; You have to decide today
[1:34:59] who has your allegiance.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Do you want your own way or do you want
[1:35:07] his way?
[1:35:09] [snorts]
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; I recognize
[1:35:12] that he has come in this hour because
[1:35:15] time has met prophecy
[1:35:18] and I am here to be a fulfillment. See,
[1:35:21] that's why it then it made so much sense
[1:35:23] to me. I went, "Oh my goodness, I get it
[1:35:26] now. It's here." I was trying to figure
[1:35:28] out what's that going to look like. It
[1:35:29] that's that's missing the whole point. H
[1:35:32] HOWEVER THAT TURNS OUT, THAT'S HOW IT'S
[1:35:34] GOING TO TURN OUT. BUT THAT MISSES THE
[1:35:36] POINT THE PROPHET'S TRYING TO MAKE.
[1:35:37] [laughter]
[1:35:38] HE'S TRYING TO MAKE THE POINT THAT HE
[1:35:40] CAN COME AND DWELL BECAUSE HIS PEOPLE
[1:35:42] ARE FULLY REDEEMED. IN OTHER WORDS, THE
[1:35:45] ENTIRE GOD IS ON DISPLAY.
[1:35:48] THE ENTIRE FAMILY OF [screaming] GOD IS
[1:35:51] ON DISPLAY. AND THE EARTH, A REDEEMED
[1:35:53] EARTH, IS GOD ON DISPLAY BECAUSE HE
[1:35:56] ALWAYS FILLED ALL TIME, SPACE, AND
[1:35:58] ETERNITY. AND THEN, BUT WAIT, THERE'S
[1:36:01] MORE. [laughter]
[1:36:04] I STARTED TO PUT IN MY NOTES, I HAVE
[1:36:06] JUST ONE MORE THING, but I would
[1:36:07] offended the android guys. So, LET ME
[1:36:10] JUST SAY, BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.
[1:36:13] Because once you get there, then the the
[1:36:17] hidden mana and brother Brandham says,
[1:36:19] "What will that be?" That'll be the
[1:36:21] eternal unfolding of the mystery of God
[1:36:25] as he continues through the ceaseless
[1:36:27] ages.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Friends, what a day,
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; what an hour WE HAVE COME TO. WHAT A
[1:36:33] BLESSED TIME TO BE A BELIEVER. YEAH. YOU
[1:36:36] YOU THE CALENDAR DIDN'T COME TO YOU. YOU
[1:36:39] CAME TO THE CALENDAR. HALLELUJAH. JUST
[1:36:41] LIKE WHEN IT WAS EXACTLY 50 DAYS, THE
[1:36:44] THAT NUMBER ON THE CALENDAR WHEN CHRIST
[1:36:46] COMES AND ONE OF THESE MORNINGS THERE'S
[1:36:48] GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE FE SEEING A
[1:36:51] LOT OF THEIR OLD LOVED ONES IN KITCHENS
[1:36:53] AND LIVING ROOMS AROUND THE WORLD. AND
[1:36:55] IT'S GOING TO BE ON FROM THERE.
[1:36:57] HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; And we'll lift up off THIS EARTH. AND
[1:37:02] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, UH, SHE'S WAVING,
[1:37:04] HE SAID, WE'LL RISE UP AND WAVE GOODBYE.
[1:37:07] [screaming]
[1:37:08] [laughter]
[1:37:09] AH, HOW MANY WANT TO WAVE BEFORE THE
[1:37:11] LORD TODAY AND BE A WAVE OFFERING? SAY,
[1:37:13] "GOODBYE, OLD WORLD. GOODBYE."
