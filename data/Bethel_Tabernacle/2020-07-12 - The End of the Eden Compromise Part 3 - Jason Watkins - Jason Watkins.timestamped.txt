[32:01] happy to have you all here in God's
[32:04] house amen we were having him a good
[32:09] time in the Sunday School class this
[32:11] morning I know it's difficult to get the
[32:13] whole class for those of you who are
[32:15] going to be in the regular service
[32:17] because you're you'd be late but but
[32:20] hopefully you whatever part you couldn't
[32:23] quite get maybe you stream it on the way
[32:25] but you want to make sure you go back
[32:27] and get that because we're taking an
[32:30] in-depth study on the entire book of
[32:33] Revelation gonna take a while and we're
[32:36] gonna go through it slowly because I
[32:39] believe it's the brides book I believe
[32:42] it's it's really has its moment in these
[32:46] last days Amen it was sealed up but it
[32:50] was promised that it would be opened up
[32:52] at the end time and we believe it amen
[32:56] we can see it live and that's how we
[32:58] know that it's the word and man lives in
[33:02] you and I praise the Lord Amen want to
[33:05] just thank you all for your prayers and
[33:08] the food and the flowers and the
[33:10] different things that's been brought to
[33:13] the house so much food I'm gonna
[33:14] probably gain 900 pounds trying to eat
[33:16] it all and so we we've got plenty and
[33:19] sister Brenda kept coming with more and
[33:22] more and then when she got done more and
[33:25] more and it's wonderful and especially
[33:30] the sweets oh I'm supposed to say that
[33:34] amen praise the Lord so Amen those those
[33:38] cookies sister Brenda Wow
[33:40] and give Haley a run for her money on
[33:42] her peanut butter cookies they were

[33:45] she made they're like walnut and
[33:47] chocolate chip but boy they were good no
[33:49] you can't have any amens
[33:51] I'm gonna hoard them for sure amen but I
[33:55] just want to appreciate you all for the
[33:57] prayers and the cards and the flowers
[33:59] and the visits and phone calls and it's
[34:02] been wonderful and sister Debbie's
[34:04] making good progress and every test she
[34:07] takes comes back with good results
[34:10] and no serious issues whatsoever just
[34:13] some stress borne upper GI complications
[34:18] and a lot of inflammation stress stress
[34:20] induced because the situation that
[34:23] suddenly came upon us our family with
[34:26] declining health of her mom and dad that
[34:28] came out of nowhere they were fine one
[34:31] day and the next day you know her dad's
[34:33] on dialysis her mom seems to be fading
[34:36] out and and so but we've got a lot of
[34:39] that under control the Lord has really
[34:40] been gracious so that's kind of lowered
[34:42] the stress level down and appreciate all
[34:46] the care of the medical staff here at
[34:48] the church have had all of them working
[34:50] on her amen so they've been working
[34:52] together and getting her better a man I
[34:55] can't do without her so I keep telling
[34:58] reminding the Lord of that amen
[35:01] oh no you're right brother shouldn't
[35:05] have confessed that I knew you'd be
[35:06] streaming oh my okay
[35:08] I'll go back on that diet for sure no
[35:10] problem amen I just got busted but I am
[35:19] enjoying my my um my all my food amen
[35:23] so praise the Lord we're happy to have
[35:25] you here today and I just wanted to pass
[35:27] along those comments thank you for your
[35:30] prayers and let's look in the book of
[35:32] Revelation this morning want to continue
[35:36] and hopefully the Lord willing we plan
[35:40] to finish up this three-part series
[35:42] looks like it's going to be in three I
[35:44] should be able to get it today and we
[35:46] want to conclude this series titled the
[35:50] end of the eden compromise how many know
[35:55] that was a fateful compromise that was
[35:58] made there in Eden to choose the tree of
[36:02] knowledge of good and evil over the Tree
[36:04] of Life and it has had a devastating
[36:07] consequence on the earth ever since when
[36:12] the Lord you know descended in this hour
[36:16] according to revelation 10 he found the
[36:19] world in a catastrophe and so we're you
[36:23] know but thankful
[36:24] he brought an open word it's not
[36:26] designed to save the world it's designed
[36:29] to say cuz he's gonna save the word he's
[36:31] gonna change it but he's going to save
[36:33] his family out of it before it goes off
[36:36] the cliff and God's not going to destroy
[36:40] it God loves life he doesn't he's not a
[36:42] destroyer of life he often just simply
[36:46] pulls out all the stops and and man
[36:48] destroys himself and so it's too bad
[36:51] it's sad that but no one will be able to
[36:54] impugn that's why when you read the
[36:56] either Matthew 25 at the judgment bar or
[37:00] you go over in the book of Revelation to
[37:02] the judgment bar you don't find anybody
[37:05] crying foul nobody's jumping up all is
[37:08] unfair you know you know you're you're
[37:11] you're you're not giving me justice and
[37:13] that nobody every man knows at that
[37:17] moment that they have earned their way
[37:19] to destruction and the Lord tried every
[37:23] way even more ways than men could
[37:26] imagine to save man he doesn't take
[37:28] pleasure even in the death of the sinner
[37:31] God would that all men come to
[37:33] repentance don't ever forget that
[37:35] friends don't ever let your your
[37:36] attitude become so jaded with the things
[37:40] that you see going on in the world that
[37:41] you lose sight of the love of God and no
[37:44] matter what you might be seeing a person
[37:47] act out in a certain way remember Jesus
[37:49] died for them and and and maybe all they
[37:52] need is a little bit of love see and and
[37:55] somebody to tell them about the love of
[37:57] God somebody's brother Fred Mullins says
[37:59] I want I'm trying to tell everybody
[38:01] about somebody who can help anybody Amen
[38:06] I love that praise the Lord in
[38:09] Revelation chapter 21
[38:11] let me get started here we shouldn't be
[38:13] too long today I should be able to
[38:14] finish it up pretty easily and get right
[38:19] to it just want to finish out the
[38:21] burdens upon my heart for the word I
[38:23] don't believe I had any other
[38:26] announcements or prayer requests that
[38:28] came to me if you have some and you're
[38:32] streaming and you want to send it if you
[38:34] send it to me by text it'll probably
[38:37] hit my device here and I'll see it
[38:39] revelation 21 we'll get to catch verses
[38:45] one to five I think that's what I gave
[38:49] you hey Josh you know one to five yeah
[38:51] to Revelation 21:1 to five amen and I
[38:55] saw a new heaven and a new earth for the
[38:58] first heaven and the first Earth were
[39:01] passed away and there was no more sea
[39:03] and I John saw the holy city the New
[39:07] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[39:09] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[39:12] her husband and I heard a great voice
[39:15] out of heaven saying behold the
[39:18] tabernacle of God is with men and he
[39:21] will dwell with them and they shall be
[39:24] his people and God himself shall be with
[39:27] them and be their God and shall wipe
[39:30] away all tears from their eyes and there
[39:34] shall be no more death in that wonderful
[39:36] neither sorrow nor crying neither
[39:40] neither shall there be any more pain for
[39:43] the former things are passed away and he
[39:48] that sat listen at this concluding
[39:50] promise and he that sat upon the throne
[39:53] said behold I make all things new and he
[39:58] said unto me write for these words are
[40:01] true and faithful so we want to just bow
[40:06] our heads now and ask the Lord to bless
[40:08] the reading of his word father we thank
[40:10] you for your word we commit we are
[40:13] committing ourselves our whole hearts to
[40:15] your word today be with us now as we try
[40:17] to deliver this thought that is upon my
[40:20] heart now Lord let it be for the
[40:23] strength for the direction Lord for the
[40:27] people to be able to face and be
[40:29] overcomers
[40:30] of the of the challenges that we see
[40:33] today Lord the earth is in a condition
[40:36] that I don't think any of us quite
[40:38] foresaw it turning out like it has been
[40:41] and Lord we know that it's only going to
[40:44] get worse it can never go back to normal
[40:47] it's only it's a new
[40:49] normal and then this one will get worse
[40:51] and then this one won't be returned to
[40:53] and then that one will get worse and
[40:55] that one won't be returned to its
[40:57] according to your prophecy Lord it's
[41:00] going toward its conclusion it's
[41:03] irreversible it's unstoppable
[41:05] and Lord it's all part of your plan
[41:07] you're going to renew it you're not
[41:09] going to destroy the world you're going
[41:11] to renew it and father we thank you that
[41:14] you've given us your word that we might
[41:16] be a part of your divine renewal we
[41:20] commit it and ourselves into your hands
[41:23] in Jesus name Amen god bless you as
[41:26] you're seated Josh I didn't send it to
[41:29] you but let's uh let's go to second
[41:31] Corinthians five and I just want to read
[41:33] a single verse second Corinthians 5:17
[41:38] one verse here thank you brother
[41:40] Luther second Corinthians 5:7 which is
[41:43] that right let's see yep thank are the
[41:45] ends 5:17 therefore if any man be in
[41:50] Christ he is a new creature old things
[41:55] are passed away and here's that term
[41:58] again behold all things are become new I
[42:04] I love that verse because God is showing
[42:08] that he's going to the same way he
[42:11] redeems you
[42:13] he's redeeming the earth same way
[42:15] redeemed the earth
[42:16] he's redeeming you we came from the
[42:19] earth we are part of his his expression
[42:21] he expressed the earth for you to live
[42:24] in and it's an eternal attribute of God
[42:26] it can never be annihilated it's going
[42:29] to be renovated and by his spoken word
[42:32] which is amazing and and and wonderful
[42:37] because it was his original word that
[42:40] built it so he's going to go back and
[42:42] fire up his machinery of creation again
[42:45] and whereas in the first time he used
[42:48] the logos that went across and created
[42:51] the heavens and the earth and brooded
[42:52] over the earth this time he's going to
[42:54] use the extension of the logos which is
[42:57] he was the beginning of the creation of
[42:59] God you're the continuation of that
[43:02] and now you're gonna take the machinery
[43:04] of creation into you and you're gonna
[43:07] rebuild the Millennial world Oh
[43:10] hallelujah no wonder this word was able
[43:15] to save you from your sin and make you a
[43:18] new creation in Christ Jesus he said I
[43:22] make he's going to can do it you can't
[43:26] do it to yourself he says I make all
[43:28] things new that's a very broad statement
[43:32] Paul saying saying here behold all
[43:35] things are become new
[43:36] old things I love it let me read it in
[43:39] its entirety again therefore if any man
[43:40] be in Christ are you in Christ he is a
[43:44] how'd you get into Christ by accepting
[43:47] his word for the hour that's how
[43:49] everybody that ever got in him got in
[43:51] him they accepted his word for the hour
[43:53] that was Peters message to the Jews you
[43:56] you didn't believe it and so I'm telling
[43:59] you now you better repent of that and
[44:01] believe it and if you believe it you can
[44:04] be saved hallelujah but you're gonna
[44:07] have to save yourselves how do I save
[44:09] myself by believing it and then and by
[44:13] accepting its lordship in the into your
[44:16] heart therefore if any man be in Christ
[44:19] he is a new creature old things are
[44:22] passed away behold all things are become
[44:25] new
[44:25] I've never heard a commentary on that
[44:29] verse that surpasses the one that our
[44:34] own brother Jason DeMars made here and
[44:36] he says he's talks about how that when
[44:39] you're a new creature and old things are
[44:41] passed away and all things are become
[44:43] new and he said freedom this freedom
[44:47] that this gives freedom in the new birth
[44:50] is is having your will transformed by
[44:55] the power of God so that you desire to
[44:58] live the way God designed human beings
[45:01] to live Wow he said that probably months
[45:07] ago I wrote it down put it in mine in my
[45:09] Bible I love that statement that's real
[45:13] freedom
[45:15] people oftentimes you find them
[45:18] abandoning the word and running from the
[45:20] word that God has sent to this hour well
[45:23] you run away from freedom when you do
[45:25] and what's ironic is the devil gives
[45:29] them and sells them the lie and they
[45:31] purchase it that they're getting away
[45:34] from the truth so they can get to
[45:36] freedom and it's the exact opposite of
[45:39] that you run away from God's Word you
[45:41] run into bondage the only form of
[45:44] freedom is having your will transformed
[45:48] by the power of God so that you desire
[45:51] to live the way God designed human
[45:55] beings to live amen brother JD Wow that
[46:00] was epic brother and God did it that's a
[46:04] big point it's two word it's three words
[46:07] God did it but that's some of the three
[46:11] most profound words you'll hear in this
[46:13] entire sermon I'm here to tell you God
[46:16] did it I couldn't do it for you you
[46:18] couldn't do it for you God did it and
[46:21] then God put me into this God revealed
[46:25] himself to me how am I gonna knock
[46:27] myself out I couldn't get myself in oh
[46:30] my hallelujah I'm signed and I'm sealed
[46:35] signed in the blood of Christ sealed in
[46:37] the Holy Ghost
[46:39] I love how that when God does things I
[46:43] said made this statement briefly in the
[46:46] Sunday School class he didn't need
[46:48] anyone's permission to save me
[46:52] he didn't need anyone's permission to
[46:55] save you he didn't need anyone's
[46:58] permission to send a prophet he didn't
[47:01] need anyone's approval on that he didn't
[47:03] even need anyone's agreement he doesn't
[47:06] need the devil to agree with him that I
[47:08] got to be saved the devil would never
[47:11] agree to let me be saved and because I
[47:14] had a mind as Paul said that I was born
[47:17] with when I was born in sin that was
[47:19] enmity against God and could never but
[47:21] never agree with God even I couldn't
[47:24] agree to be saved and the proof is I
[47:26] went for years not say
[47:27] but oh my somebody who loved me more
[47:31] than I loved me chase me down knocked me
[47:33] down rolled me over and pick me up and I
[47:36] became a new creation in Christ so when
[47:42] you when you abandon that mercy of God
[47:45] the word revealed in any age is his
[47:48] mercy when you run away from that you
[47:51] run away from freedom if you're a if
[47:54] you're a minister and some have been and
[47:57] they abandoned the word of the hour you
[48:01] ain't you invalidate your calling as
[48:03] soon as you do that you know that's my
[48:05] message to them you invalidate your
[48:07] calling you would literally void your
[48:09] commission because the Commission was
[48:12] going to all the world and preach the
[48:13] gospel
[48:15] that's the Commission you have no other
[48:18] authority if you're not doing that God
[48:20] does not backup men who run after their
[48:23] own desires
[48:24] he only backs up his word he has one
[48:26] provided way and you either come the way
[48:28] of His Word or you don't come see so
[48:32] it's it's nothing to fool around with
[48:34] because there's no coming back from that
[48:36] when you do that and that's that's sad
[48:39] to me that's very sad you know to
[48:42] abandon his word to become a disbeliever
[48:45] of something that God and you you you
[48:48] you trample it underfoot the blood of
[48:51] the Covenant Paul said and as is as if
[48:54] you're calling it an unholy thing and
[48:58] there's no coming back from from
[49:01] abandoning God's Word I'm you know what
[49:04] I'm gonna take some friends I'm very
[49:06] glad that personal failures don't do
[49:09] that to me I'm glad of that I'm glad
[49:13] that my personal failures won't keep me
[49:15] out and I got a bunch of them so I
[49:19] thought you were made new I am that's
[49:21] why I hate them I used to love them now
[49:23] I don't love them and when I used to do
[49:25] them I never repented now when I make a
[49:27] mistake I repent quickly because why
[49:29] I've had my desires changed that is how
[49:35] powerful faith in the revealed
[49:39] is in the eyes of God when you believe
[49:44] his word ah his word of your hour when
[49:49] you accept as I said earlier when you
[49:52] accept his lordship
[49:54] you can't just believe it the devil
[49:55] believes it's true but you've got to
[49:57] accept the words lordship in your heart
[50:01] when you do that friends then all
[50:04] external areas of your life are covered
[50:07] in the blood of Christ think about that
[50:10] so powerful such a thing that it is with
[50:14] God that when you open your heart and
[50:17] surrender all of your heart to Christ
[50:20] and he comes in and you allow him to be
[50:22] the lord of your heart and take up his
[50:24] rightful position and your throne the
[50:27] blood of Jesus covers all your external
[50:29] life going forward forever and there
[50:33] because you have passed from death to
[50:35] life Paul could say now there is no
[50:38] therefore no condemnation to who - them
[50:42] who are in Christ Jesus this is why he
[50:48] could faithfully promise all things
[50:52] would be new because he he was aware he
[50:58] believed he understood his own ability
[51:01] to redeem his family that there was no
[51:05] power that could keep his family from
[51:09] him and therefore he could say to his
[51:12] family even though you're going to
[51:15] continue in a fallen body even though
[51:17] you're still gonna be tempted even
[51:19] though you're still gonna stumble and
[51:21] you're gonna make mistakes I'm gonna I'm
[51:24] gonna change your heart and I know it
[51:26] won't be your desire and when you make
[51:28] those mistakes I'm gonna cover you in
[51:30] the blood I know you'll repent you know
[51:32] I'll forgive you and you're still gonna
[51:34] be my child and I'm never going to lose
[51:37] you I'm gonna taste something friends
[51:40] that's a beautiful promise that's a
[51:42] wonderful thing that is what his
[51:45] Millennium if you think about the
[51:47] millennial reign of Christ for the earth
[51:50] and we just talk naturally for a minute
[51:51] now that's the spirit
[51:52] side of your new birth but you know what
[51:56] one will his millennial reign be able to
[51:59] accomplish if you think about the plight
[52:03] of mankind from the book of Genesis not
[52:08] having accepted mankind having accepted
[52:12] knowledge from the tree of knowledge
[52:16] over God's wisdom in his word
[52:21] mankind has ruined himself and he not
[52:26] only has ruined himself as brother
[52:29] Branham would say it put every graveyard
[52:32] that's ever been in the earth that
[52:35] fateful decision that fateful decision
[52:40] that they made to choose knowledge from
[52:42] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[52:44] over the Tree of Life which was full of
[52:47] God's wisdom that faithful decision that
[52:50] they made it was fatal to humanity and
[52:53] it was fatal to the world it put every
[52:57] tombstone it caused every siren that you
[53:00] hear every gunshot every war every time
[53:04] a soldier screamed in agony as he bled
[53:07] out on a battlefield that's what caused
[53:09] it mankind has ruined himself and he's
[53:13] also ruined in the world we live in we
[53:20] live in a world that is immersed in a we
[53:25] and we are immersed in it friends this
[53:28] is why church and fellowship and reading
[53:31] your Bible and praying and hearing the
[53:33] hearing the word in hearing live
[53:34] ministry and hearing archived and every
[53:37] piece of word hearing the tapes every
[53:39] piece of word that you can get your
[53:41] hands on feed on at night and day let it
[53:44] you say I have such a hard time for the
[53:47] Jason because I am my flesh has this
[53:49] appetite and I feed on too many things
[53:51] in the world push it out by increasing
[53:54] your reading of this just push it out
[53:56] push it out of your schedule by doing
[53:59] things that are spiritual push it out of
[54:01] your schedule see because I can tell you
[54:05] your flesh will
[54:06] always be tempted by those kinds of
[54:08] things and you'll always make allowances
[54:11] for yourself to say oh it's not too bad
[54:13] you know my goodness it's not gonna hurt
[54:15] me that bad but it does it has a
[54:18] corrosive effect and so I have found in
[54:21] my own personal experiences can you
[54:23] imagine I have weaknesses would you ever
[54:26] think it so you know what I what I do I
[54:30] realize this old flesh stealin converted
[54:32] so when I when I see too many things
[54:35] over the world occupying too much of my
[54:37] time and I'm not even talking about
[54:39] sinful things I'm just talking about
[54:41] things that have no benefit to my
[54:42] spirituality and maybe even have a tinge
[54:45] of corrosiveness too much virtuality
[54:47] come on let's be honest today come on
[54:49] friends 21st century we live in this
[54:51] stuff it's a soup we swim around in and
[54:54] what I have found successfully say
[54:57] brother Jason
[54:57] give me a tool that can help me be an
[54:59] overcomer increase your time in your
[55:02] Bible
[55:02] increase your time in the tapes increase
[55:05] your time in church
[55:06] increase your time in prayer increase
[55:08] your time in fellowship push out those
[55:12] things give the Bible says give no place
[55:15] for it I know let's give no time for it
[55:18] see because we are today immersed in a
[55:24] culture that is contrary to biblical
[55:28] values do you believe that contrary to
[55:32] biblical absolutes
[55:36] they're all gone they're all gone I
[55:41] heard Ravi Zacharias preaching on that
[55:43] recently said they're all gone it was it
[55:46] struck me to hear an evangelical that
[55:50] aware and as believers we're we're there
[55:54] we're to that we find that that that all
[55:59] definitions and absolutes have gone
[56:02] relativism has won the day relativism
[56:06] all absolutes are gone you know
[56:09] relativism is is somebody you say well I
[56:12] believe this is right and the relativism
[56:16] says well that's right for you
[56:18] that doesn't make it
[56:20] right for me and just because I don't do
[56:24] that doesn't mean I'm wrong
[56:27] relativism says whatever I think is
[56:30] right is right and you can and it
[56:33] doesn't matter you can read it out of
[56:35] God's Word but even the Bible absolutes
[56:38] even Bible morals Bible scruples there
[56:41] even the Bible itself it's now relative
[56:45] well that's your interpretation of it
[56:47] and I say I I don't want your
[56:49] interpretation or my interpretation God
[56:51] interprets his own word by bringing it
[56:53] to pass I'm not telling you that I
[56:56] learned a doctrine I'm telling you that
[56:58] I found a being who lives and he's alive
[57:01] and he lives in people who I know who I
[57:04] mingle with and fellowship with and I
[57:06] know what a power of God in my life has
[57:08] brought life into my life so it's right
[57:14] for you but it but you know it's it's
[57:16] not incumbent upon others Zacharias said
[57:20] this Ravi Zacharias he said all we hear
[57:23] today and I thought how poignant I
[57:25] wonder if he really knows why that is I
[57:26] don't think he was kept connecting the
[57:29] dot that Laodicea means people's rights
[57:33] and that's why you see that today and he
[57:36] made this statement all we hear today is
[57:39] rights rights rights very seldom do we
[57:44] hear of what is right cause a powerful
[57:50] statement all we hear is rights rights
[57:53] rights very seldom do we hear of what is
[57:56] right I'm here to take some friends in
[57:59] the Millenium he's going to take
[58:01] everything that knowledge / wisdom
[58:04] destroyed and he's going to return it
[58:06] back to its original condition and the
[58:08] beautiful part is is that he's restoring
[58:12] the original
[58:13] and that includes you that includes me
[58:17] we're all here today every one of us you
[58:21] don't even have to be very old to have
[58:23] regrets in the back of your mind
[58:26] and then the older you are depending on
[58:27] how you're raised in the life you lived
[58:29] and maybe when it went sideways early
[58:31] maybe had poor raising maybe had false
[58:34] teaching I don't know but we've all got
[58:35] I didn't have any of that stuff and yet
[58:38] I got a ton of things I regret I had
[58:41] good raising raised on the word from the
[58:43] day I was born but yet even I stand here
[58:46] today and I think if I could just go
[58:48] back to that if I could just go back to
[58:49] that I'd change that I'd redo that I
[58:51] would have done it like that I'm here to
[58:53] tell you God is restoring the original
[58:56] say what was my original state how I was
[58:59] in his mind so how were you in his mind
[59:03] as the same as him I was as perfect as
[59:06] God was and today he's bringing an end
[59:12] to this Eden compromise he's restoring
[59:17] the original in the in the analogy of
[59:24] the hidden manna that you can read about
[59:27] in the book of Revelation and I'll give
[59:30] you a hit man and a white stone and in
[59:33] the stone a new name written that no man
[59:34] knoweth save he that it's - and this
[59:39] hidden man of course had an application
[59:41] in that in that middle age where it's
[59:43] recorded in the book of Revelation but
[59:45] but we have found in the opening of the
[59:48] word of this hour that it has a future
[59:50] revelation where God is he said someday
[59:53] he and that word will become what you
[59:56] never dreamed possible so we find in the
[59:59] Millennium when he talks about restoring
[1:00:01] thanks to its original condition he's
[1:00:03] going to take you he's going to take his
[1:00:06] word and he's going to take the world to
[1:00:09] Heights that have never before been
[1:00:13] imagined it's still his world you know
[1:00:18] don't let don't let the world get to get
[1:00:22] you believing that they own it or that
[1:00:25] they're in control of it they are
[1:00:26] neither neither one of those things are
[1:00:29] true this is still his world he built it
[1:00:32] he owns
[1:00:34] he baptized it in Noah's day it didn't
[1:00:37] matter all the unbelief and they have
[1:00:38] the antediluvian world it still got its
[1:00:41] baptism Enoch still within a rapture
[1:00:44] hallelujah Noah still got saved by going
[1:00:47] into an ark he he he poured his blood
[1:00:50] down the cross and his blood went down
[1:00:53] and saturated the ground and he cleaned
[1:00:55] the earth I'm here to tell you he's
[1:00:58] going to give it a fiery baptism and
[1:01:00] he's going to make all things new again
[1:01:02] hallelujah that's how I got you water
[1:01:05] blood and spirit that's how a baby comes
[1:01:07] in water breaks blood breaks life comes
[1:01:09] hallelujah justification sanctification
[1:01:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost glory to God
[1:01:14] hallelujah that's what we're a part of
[1:01:17] today you're part of the grand
[1:01:19] restoration and I'm here to tell you you
[1:01:23] can't stop it the world can't stop it
[1:01:25] nobody can stop it hallelujah he's gonna
[1:01:28] do it he's gonna take this world he's
[1:01:30] gonna take his word and he's gonna take
[1:01:32] you and lift you to Heights you've never
[1:01:35] imagined you could be add he's restoring
[1:01:38] the original in the original I won't
[1:01:43] have any regrets hallelujah and the
[1:01:47] original I won't have anything to be
[1:01:49] sorry for
[1:01:50] in the original oh my brothers sister
[1:01:54] who could not want a word in this hour
[1:01:57] that gives us back our original
[1:01:59] condition we told you last Sunday that
[1:02:05] Christ has started a he's a counter
[1:02:07] revolutionary counter revolutionaries
[1:02:11] that world thinks they're counter
[1:02:12] revolutionaries they don't clue counter
[1:02:15] revolutionary is engaged in or promoting
[1:02:18] a revolution that opposes a previous one
[1:02:21] or reverses its results we are
[1:02:25] emissaries of an approaching revolution
[1:02:29] it has nothing to do with the political

[1:11:17] part in the song almost brings me to
[1:11:19] tears every time I hear it and I'd say

[1:14:12] Oh hallelujah oh my do you know do you
[1:14:17] know there there's even there the world
[1:14:20] has gone into such craziness and that's
[1:14:25] how you can tell it's being driven by an
[1:14:26] evil spirit because it does things that
[1:14:28] don't even make sense doesn't even make
[1:14:30] sense
[1:14:31] and you know there's even a movement and
[1:14:34] I I didn't know this I go I I think I
[1:14:38] made this statement in several Sundays
[1:14:42] ago about that song that John Lennon
[1:14:47] wrote and he talks about you know it
[1:14:51] called imagine and any talk any and I
[1:14:55] don't know that I've ever heard the song
[1:14:56] all the way through but I was looking at
[1:14:58] the lyrics because I've heard pieces of
[1:15:00] it over the years but I know it's
[1:15:02] message and and its message was to was
[1:15:05] to say imagine there's no heaven it's
[1:15:08] easy if you try no hell below us above
[1:15:11] us only sky imagine all the people
[1:15:15] living for today just living for today
[1:15:19] with no thought of tomorrow now in
[1:15:23] concept that's what heaven will be you
[1:15:27] won't have to worry about it tomorrow
[1:15:28] because there won't be a tomorrow do you
[1:15:30] understand that mankind being made in
[1:15:33] the image of God is longs for this kind
[1:15:35] of existence do you know that's why they
[1:15:37] MIT built the Tower of Babel because
[1:15:40] they knew that they had fallen from
[1:15:41] something they knew they were dying it
[1:15:43] wasn't right something something's not
[1:15:45] right we didn't the world didn't start
[1:15:47] this way what's the answer listen I say
[1:15:49] we build a tower and break into heaven
[1:15:51] and get get something back that was
[1:15:54] taken from us and it would have worked
[1:15:56] because they caught a revelation of
[1:15:59] unity and they were of one mind and they
[1:16:01] were of one Accord
[1:16:02] and they had the same diet the same
[1:16:04] speech in the same language it meant
[1:16:07] that they spoke the same dialect and it
[1:16:09] also meant that they were one in mind
[1:16:11] and heart see now that's that's how God
[1:16:13] operates his family they were all in the
[1:16:16] upper room and they were in one mind and
[1:16:18] one Accord and suddenly there came a man
[1:16:21] and and brother Ram talks about if the
[1:16:23] family of God can ever to Saul get
[1:16:25] together
[1:16:25] he said the rapture will go so that's
[1:16:27] that's God's secret to God's power is
[1:16:30] oneness unity faith universal faith in
[1:16:35] God's Word by the whole family and here
[1:16:38] God comes down and begins to examine it
[1:16:40] and he begins to catch and see what's
[1:16:42] going on and he says now this was God
[1:16:44] saying not a man is God now this they've
[1:16:47] begun to do and now nothing can be
[1:16:49] restrained from them even whatsoever
[1:16:51] they would imagine and so God kind of
[1:16:55] used the devil's trick on him and he
[1:16:56] confounded him with confusion the devil
[1:16:58] does that so the devil is trying to use
[1:17:00] God's tools - God has used his and
[1:17:01] wrecked it again wrecked the whole thing
[1:17:03] and they left off building they couldn't
[1:17:05] even communicate anymore in this and it
[1:17:06] spread him out across the whole world
[1:17:08] because that's what they were supposed
[1:17:09] to do see building that tower was
[1:17:11] contrary to the Word of God when they
[1:17:13] came out of the flood God's command was
[1:17:15] now spread spread through the earth and
[1:17:18] and the Genesis principles back into
[1:17:19] play multiply and cover the earth
[1:17:21] repopulate everything and that's what
[1:17:24] the Commission was given to Noah and his
[1:17:26] sons to do and now here these people are
[1:17:28] saying no no no we're all stronger
[1:17:31] together there's safety in numbers we're
[1:17:32] going to all assemble in the valley of
[1:17:34] Shinar and we're gonna build a church in
[1:17:36] the tower we're gonna have a worship
[1:17:37] we're gonna you were gonna do what Cain
[1:17:38] did see it's always contrary to God's
[1:17:42] Word and and so so so you know there's
[1:17:46] and and I was I was saying to myself you
[1:17:48] know what a what an erroneous position
[1:17:51] for a superstar rock star you know to be
[1:17:57] one of the what do they call that the
[1:17:58] four lads that shook the world and to
[1:18:02] say imagine there's no heaven it's easy
[1:18:04] if do you know that they're that couple
[1:18:06] of weeks later all right there is it
[1:18:08] there's actually a movement - they're
[1:18:12] trying to change everything so much they
[1:18:13] actually want to change our national
[1:18:15] anthem and they
[1:18:16] said let's change it from the
[1:18:18] star-spangled banner' to imagine by John
[1:18:21] Lennon it's not a joke that's for real
[1:18:24] there's actually a movement trying to
[1:18:26] get that done and I thought to myself it
[1:18:30] doesn't surprise me because the world
[1:18:34] chose the Beatles over Jesus and the
[1:18:38] Beatles bragged about it we're more
[1:18:40] popular than Jesus Christ and it wasn't
[1:18:42] a false statement they were brother bond
[1:18:45] talked about that in the 50s he said
[1:18:47] nearly every kid can tell you who Davy
[1:18:49] Crocket was in the 1950s he said
[1:18:51] probably not a tenth of them could tell
[1:18:53] you who Jesus Christ is we saw that you
[1:18:55] remember the testimony that brother
[1:18:56] William Smith brother Dale's brother
[1:18:58] right up here at our own Hospital
[1:19:01] y'all ever hear that brother William was
[1:19:03] there when he's lived here and he's in
[1:19:04] the hospital and I forget now why he was
[1:19:08] in the ER and he's sitting there waiting
[1:19:10] to be seen and here's a man and a woman
[1:19:11] with a little girls about she's about
[1:19:13] probably eight maybe nine years old said
[1:19:15] cute little girl and he said Williams
[1:19:17] said he said I could tell she was very
[1:19:18] sick she just looked flushed and didn't
[1:19:20] like she didn't feel good and the mom
[1:19:22] and dad were sitting there I said I
[1:19:23] could tell they they weren't Christians
[1:19:24] and he said I thought well you know I'm
[1:19:26] a minister let me see if I can encourage
[1:19:27] them at least and so he he just said do
[1:19:30] you mind if I I'm a minister do you mind
[1:19:32] if I talk to her sure yeah go ahead and
[1:19:34] he said you know honey
[1:19:36] you okay and she said I don't feel good
[1:19:38] and I said well you know and he began to
[1:19:41] witness to her said you know Jesus can
[1:19:43] heal you you know and in the Word of God
[1:19:44] by His stripes you can be healed and and
[1:19:47] you could believe it right now and I've
[1:19:49] seen many little girls just like you
[1:19:50] that jesus healed and he said would you
[1:19:53] like for Jesus to heal you and that
[1:19:55] little girl in perfect innocence looked
[1:19:59] at him and said who's Jesus and he said
[1:20:04] it's so shocked him and the mom and dad
[1:20:06] just dropped their head and stared at
[1:20:07] the floor and here she says who's Jesus
[1:20:10] she had never even heard the name he's
[1:20:17] in a hospital with a strange the illness
[1:20:18] and she still doesn't even know his name
[1:20:20] I'm gonna take some friends the world
[1:20:23] long ago chose they chose the Beatles
[1:20:25] over Jesus they chose they chose
[1:20:30] doctrine of John Lennon because songs
[1:20:34] are sermon set to music
[1:20:38] they chose the doctrine of John Lennon
[1:20:42] they chose the doctrine of Paul
[1:20:44] McCartney over the doctrine of Jesus
[1:20:47] Christ you know I got one thing to say
[1:20:52] and I don't mean to speak evil over the
[1:20:54] dead but I just feel like saying out
[1:20:56] loud you were wrong John Lennon there is
[1:20:59] a heaven above and I'm sure you're a
[1:21:02] believer of that now there is a hell
[1:21:04] bleeped below and I'm quite positive you
[1:21:06] don't still believe what you wrote that
[1:21:09] what you were imagining was nonsense
[1:21:11] there is a heaven to live for and there
[1:21:14] is a hell to be avoided and it does
[1:21:16] matter what you do and think and say you
[1:21:19] can't just live for today I'm here to
[1:21:21] tell you I don't live for this day at
[1:21:22] all my whole day is this how can I serve
[1:21:25] God like Paul for me to live is Christ
[1:21:27] and to die is gain and I have said to
[1:21:30] you years and years and years I've said
[1:21:32] it and I'll say it again you've heard it
[1:21:33] for the umpteenth time this life is not
[1:21:36] about this life this life is about the
[1:21:38] next one coming this is only a proving

[1:22:44] we desire world like that I desire my
[1:22:47] life to look like that too I want my
[1:22:49] life to look like the millennium so that
[1:22:52] when I go there I fit right in
[1:22:55] but you know friends there's always
[1:22:59] something to distract us you ever
[1:23:03] noticed that we you have to understand
[1:23:06] that this is Satan's tactic especially
[1:23:09] he's making vital use of our 21st
[1:23:12] century there's always there's never
[1:23:15] been an age where there's so many so
[1:23:19] much I sit like this there's so much
[1:23:21] stuff to distract you sometimes you know

[1:23:27] stuff say like what I don't know stuff
[1:23:30] figure it out whatever is distracting
[1:23:34] you there's always something to laugh at
[1:23:36] always something to research always some
[1:23:38] news to catch up on always something to
[1:23:40] respond to but when do we visit that
[1:23:43] little room that that pillar fire said
[1:23:48] to a prophet I'll meet you in there it's
[1:23:53] always something to distract us there's
[1:23:56] always something funny to look at some
[1:23:58] news to catch up something you know
[1:24:00] somebody said something I need to
[1:24:01] respond to that I'm take friends that's
[1:24:04] gonna go until we get out of here
[1:24:06] but there's also a little room there's a
[1:24:08] little room to visit you say yeah

[1:24:15] but you better find it I'm here I'll
[1:24:17] tell you I found mine and I'm trying to
[1:24:19] spend a lot more time there say because
[1:24:22] you know what I found its Christ that
[1:24:24] little room was your heart it was your
[1:24:27] heart and I hope you know the weight of
[1:24:28] your heart today I hope Satan hasn't put
[1:24:31] so much debris over the trail that leads
[1:24:34] to your heart that you can't get there
[1:24:35] anymore friends let go of Laodicea and
[1:24:39] clear your mind of its poisons and get
[1:24:42] down into your heart and find the way
[1:24:45] where the Shekinah Lou
[1:24:47] that's what we need in this hour
[1:24:50] let the sacred love I've been preaching
[1:24:55] about the final voice at the end time
[1:24:57] before I came to this series on the end
[1:24:59] of the Eden compromise we talked about
[1:25:02] how that our lives that the world would
[1:25:05] need to hear from God once more brother
[1:25:07] Branham said once more the world will
[1:25:09] hear direct from God as they did at
[1:25:10] Pentecost so let this sacred love
[1:25:16] prevail the love of God and the love of
[1:25:20] his word let that prevail in all your
[1:25:22] chaste conversation that's your
[1:25:24] lifestyle live I'm saying like this live
[1:25:29] the love of God live your life as a
[1:25:35] manifestation of the love of God embrace
[1:25:42] a sacred recognition of who you are why
[1:25:49] you're here that should that that should
[1:25:54] inform your decisions if you can realize
[1:25:57] what God why he put you here and what
[1:25:59] he's done for you and the purpose of
[1:26:02] putting you here and doing that for you
[1:26:04] I'm gonna tell you something friends
[1:26:06] that you go out in your life and you you
[1:26:08] you you you live the correct way not
[1:26:10] because it's not because it's
[1:26:12] politically correct but because it's
[1:26:16] something sacred I'm going to tell you I
[1:26:18] want to say to a world who's lost all
[1:26:21] absolutes
[1:26:21] I still have an absolute I still know an
[1:26:27] absolute he lives inside me and I'm not
[1:26:30] I don't believe in relativism it's a
[1:26:32] everything's relative it's not
[1:26:33] everything is not really everything is
[1:26:35] absolute God's Word is absolute and I
[1:26:38] want to live a life that's correct not
[1:26:40] because it's because of political
[1:26:41] pressure social pressure racial pressure
[1:26:44] it's it's not moral works in view here
[1:26:47] it's the love of God it's not about do's
[1:26:49] and don'ts it's not
[1:26:51] laundry list it's not checkboxes it's my
[1:26:53] whole life
[1:26:54] is a conversation of the love of God and
[1:26:57] everywhere I go I emanate the love of
[1:27:00] God and all my conversation all my
[1:27:03] chaste conversation I live my life
[1:27:06] becomes a portrait of the love of God
[1:27:12] let's stand I want my whole life to bear
[1:27:21] a sacred recognition not because of
[1:27:26] social pressure but because it's sacred
[1:27:28] has nothing to do with popularity it's
[1:27:31] sacred this is a sacred trust you're
[1:27:35] gonna swim upstream the world's never
[1:27:37] going to go along with it but it's
[1:27:38] sacred see don't don't acquiesce to this
[1:27:42] world don't don't get into the stream of
[1:27:45] this is right and this is right there's
[1:27:48] nothing right but this say well this is
[1:27:51] a good person there's nobody good but
[1:27:53] him none not one I'm here to tell you
[1:27:57] you can't put your confidence in any man
[1:27:59] there's only one man and that's Christ
[1:28:01] Jesus hallelujah and there was a time
[1:28:05] when Paul said there was a time when we
[1:28:08] knew him after the flesh but after the
[1:28:09] flesh we don't know him that way anymore
[1:28:12] in other words were not just we're not
[1:28:14] just worshiping history that man who
[1:28:17] lived in the flesh now lives in me this
[1:28:20] is how I know him now I'm not caught
[1:28:22] back there in a history lesson the whole
[1:28:25] world is caught back there in a history
[1:28:27] lesson of his humanity I'm here to tell
[1:28:29] you he's still in humanity and you're
[1:28:31] looking at it turn around and look at
[1:28:34] your neighbor you're looking at the
[1:28:35] humanity of Christ because he put his
[1:28:39] humanity in you by his word come
[1:28:42] musicians a man I don't think I think
[1:28:45] but the map probably had to get out for
[1:28:48] his service to Arizona so we'll sing
[1:28:52] Amen if I've got any singing voice left
[1:28:56] there you go sister praise the Lord
[1:28:59] didn't got good eye I love him and I I

[1:29:12] love of God the love of God in your life

[1:29:37] 6,000 year trial you know they have

[1:29:48] limited people okay well that's a better
[1:29:51] one that's that's a trial that Mayo did

[1:30:02] end of a trial that's been going on for
[1:30:03] six thousand years and involved all of
[1:30:05] humanity that's ever lived no age has
[1:30:10] ever been able to say qualitatively like
[1:30:13] you can say the eden compromise was a
[1:30:17] terrible idea it was a horrible idea
[1:30:23] whoever thought that up we need to never
[1:30:26] do that again let's turn back to the
