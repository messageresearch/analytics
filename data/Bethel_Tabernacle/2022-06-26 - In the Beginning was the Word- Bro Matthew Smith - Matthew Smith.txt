TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] please [Music] all right uh all right we're on um good morning everybody we'll stand and have a quick word of prayer father we come before you this morning asked that you would come into our presence father and then you would anoint my heart and my mind and my lips that i would speak what you would have me to say these people father that they would be able to see the see see what i see in it father because i see you and what i what a little material that i have your father and um i asked that you would allow me to say something that would allow them to walk closer to you in the weeks and days coming um in jesus name amen y'all can be seated um so last week we had a little biology lesson um and we went through a lot of like little microscopic structures and you know we'll see over here so you all remember that um and we really the whole purpose of that was we were showing how and originally kind of started with a a group of scientists who were able to use this these microscopic structures as a way of proving that all life on earth was made by some sort of intelligence right it wasn't intelligently designed um and that it wasn't just due to some random chance right and the the core of that whole argument really at the bottom of it was that inside of every living organism because you have a genetic package dna and that is written instructions on how to build that entire creature and to look at that and say that that's a random chance it doesn't really make any sense any more than if you know you were out in the desert and you saw a bunch of rocks in a row that also happened to be a pattern that corresponded with every you know the pattern of every amino acid in the human body we wouldn't say that that was just you know the wind blew rocks in that pattern right you know obviously someone put it there um and um and that it's it's an intelligently organized structure um and so we were because of this we can really prove that inside of every human being there's a there's a genetic you know in the dna that's intelligently designed there's no way that that just happened randomly and so um you have these scientists and they they all got together and agreed okay we can prove beyond any shroud of a doubt this is all life on earth comes from some intelligence and that's as far as they got um and we look at this and it's beautiful i love it i think it's awesome to see god but you know these scientists can prove intelligent design and they never not once mentioned god they didn't mention a creator they didn't mention the bible they didn't mention the name jehovah didn't do anything like that because they were able to improve intelligent design through science they didn't prove god the way we recognize god through you know as god um and that's partly why i mean you know again notice last week we we were able to prove intel's design and never cracked open a bible right because it's because science doesn't require a bible to function because science is running on something very very different now the the the the kind of thing that struck me so much about that whole that the scientists were able to prove intelligent design without ever even acknowledging god is that because they did it scientifically they were able to prove that god exists that some sort of god exists but they can't tell you anything about god right they can't tell you what he's like they can't tell you whether or not he likes you right the two greatest questions i feel the two greatest questions that any human being can ask are is god real and does god care about you because you know one without the other not as having answered either one of those questions creates huge problems so for instance i mean these scientists are a lot of times are approaching atheists who don't believe in any kind of god to prove god to them but the problem is if you prove that god exists to an atheist you haven't really given him any hope because now he doesn't know anything about that god you they didn't they didn't prove christianity they only proved that there is some creator that may or may not hate you right that's it they proved they proved islam as much as they proved christianity right they didn't you know there's in fact there's a whole genre of horror books and fiction about that the guy by the name of hp lovecraft wrote back in the 1900s early 1900s that dealt explicitly with what does the world look like if there's a deity an actual god that happens to hate humanity right or maybe he's just indifferent maybe just doesn't care maybe maybe god just made the universe and just went and took a nap you know and now it's all just running off the rails and falling apart because who cares right you know no no the creator of the thing doesn't care anymore you know um what happens if if there's a deity you know all of creation is built by an indifferent god or more specifically what if it's a vindictive god who just gets his kicks by torturing things right you know i mean have you ever seen a little kid get a magnifying glass and start burning ants right little kids do that stuff what's to say that there isn't what's to say that we're not living in some you know cosmic scale little kids ant farm who's having fun burning ants right sure would explain a lot of things wouldn't it right you know there's by by proving that there's a god but you haven't made any proof as to whether or not that god cares about you you just prove that god did the holocaust on purpose right and he did it just to hurt people i mean what else explanation is there if you don't have any evidence as to whether or not god cares about you and so the reason the reason why we we have this problem is ultimately because science these scientists were able to prove the existence of god but nothing about the nature of god because they're they're running off of the tree of knowledge of good and evil right i want to i want to read a quote here um i got a couple of them but um this is from separation from unbelief 1955. it says um uh i said well i appreciate that and that's good but i said here's what it is science doesn't know god i said you climb up this tree so far and the tree of knowledge only goes so far and then it's all the higher you can go i said climb up the tree of knowledge just as far as you can and step off on the tree of faith and go on believing on up like that um here's another one and i like this one particularly um this is where i think pentecost this is the message where i think pentecost failed that i said now here's what it is i said now you've got an x-ray machine there you can look through a human body and so forth well that's wonderful that's the tree of knowledge that was in the garden of eden and man's been eating from that tree since eden but i said it's got a limitation the tree of faith uh faith of god is unlimited i said you believe science as far as science can go and then when you can't you can't scientifically search it out anymore then step off and start believing from then on that's the way you have to do it okay so the reason why these scientists have a limitation is because they're operating on the tree of knowledge in the garden of eden you have two trees we're all aware one of those is the tree of life and man was never forbidden of eating from that tree of life um until man fell and then god put a flaming sword in the way right the reason why is because eating of the tree of life brings eternal life and when you but we also know that christ is that god is that is that tree of life when when adam and eve were eating of the tree of life it was in the cool of the day when god came down to commune with them right they had a relationship with the tree of life and so when when but they chose this path of of knowledge right this tree of knowledge and all your science is coming from that tree of knowledge and no matter how high you climb the tree of knowledge you're not going to find god in it because god's the tree of life you're in the wrong tree right and you're not going to know anything about god you're not gonna know anything about how what he's like what his personality is like does he care about you is there is there any kind of affection there right you can prove he exists but you can't prove whether or not he cares about you and there's only one way to do that right you have to step off that tree of knowledge you have to you know take advantage of the fact that one day on calvary there was an atonement paid and when that there's a there's a little there's a little thing there that a lot of people everybody knows about but everybody kind of doesn't overlooks and that is that curtain that separated man from the holiest hope of holies got rid torn in half from the top to bottom that's a significant event right because we know that you know when those priests would step behind that curtain if they're if they had any sin in their life they'd be they'd be struck dead instantly well why it's because that flaming sword that prevented adam and eve from going back to the tree of life was right there behind that curtain you know that tree of life lived on the other side of that curtain and if you stepped across the path of that flaming sword and you had any sin in your life you're done right you can't live in that presence but when that curtain is torn it means there's an atonement paid and that sword is no longer there right there's there's an open path back to the tree of life and you know um i i find that a major problem that people run into even a lot of a lot of we would say nominal christians is they have a tree of knowledge relationship with god right it's what they can verify their their relationship with god goes as far as well i believe in a god and that's good enough right well no um i want to read i have it written down in my in my little book here um so you don't have to initially turn to it if i can find it yeah here so this is james chapter 2 verse 19. it says thou believeth that there is one god thou doest dust well the devils also believe and tremble right so science which is this construction of the tree of knowledge is great we can even see we can see an aspect of god from it but you're not gonna know anything about god and the maximum level of revelation that you're gonna get by climbing the tree of knowledge is equivalent with satan right you're gonna tr you're gonna reach lucifer's level of of relationship with god from that tree of knowledge and as a result if you if all you had was that tree of knowledge you're going to end up believing things like well god did the holocaust on purpose right you're going to believe a lot of horrible things about god because you don't actually have a relationship there you never met god you only just sort of got some sort of second hand opinion of him right you got some view but you never actually never actually met him right and um i think i said this at the youth meeting i think this is i will say this forever i think is one of the absolute favorite things i've ever heard in my life and that is that until you've met god for yourself and had a conversation with god everything you think you know about god is a secondhand opinion right it you you have no right to have any opinion on god or what he's like or whether or not he cares about you whether or not he cares about anybody else until you've had a conversation with him right until you've had that moment where [Music] you know like ruth had to go alone and have that that very personal private conversation with boaz right alone personal to her exclusively until you've had that you don't really know you might think you know you might have you know some sort of inclination like well the bible says that jesus loves me and and that's good and you should believe that because the bible said it but until you've actually met the author you know you you really don't understand what that means you really don't you don't really know anything about the tree of life until you've actually had a conversation with the tree of life right and i think this i i really you know um when i when i saw this um it it so struck me that we are so privileged to understand that um and um one of the i would i also kind of have another little way of looking at this and that is another aspect on this right and that's because i remember i said that you know you could have a tree of knowledge understanding of god that you can think scientifically and and get some sort of aspect of of what god is like but you're not really going to know anything about it or you can prove god's existence but you can't really have a relationship with him through science well we're all aware of the scientific method and you know we've heard that term um where the scientific method comes from is this uh it's actually a philosophy um called empiricism like brother matt mentioned this a while back but when he was preaching um but empiricism is simply the idea that the only way to know what's true is by what can be measured physically or sensed you know you can observe with your senses right you know you might have somebody who thinks something's really logical and makes a lot of sense but until you put it to the test you don't really know if it's true um so you know i think the example that i gave was um i think it was aristotle the greek argued that men had more teeth than women because they were bigger had to eat more food therefore it made since they had more teeth right um and all the greeks around him was like yeah that makes total sense um good job aristotle figuring out about the teeth and then somebody and somehow nobody thought to raise their hand and just say well why don't we just count um well it turns out it took a like a thousand years but eventually somebody did count um and it turns out that no that's complete bogus um men and women have the same number of teeth uh there's some variation there some women have more some men have more but about it's on average about the same um and so that's that's what empiricism did right it went from okay this makes uh you can make a logical argument there but until you actually start counting teeth you don't really know right and so likewise scientists the scientific method is like okay we can theorize that somewhere on the inside of your cell there is some set of instructions for your whole body but until we you know pull out the x-ray you know crystallography machine we don't actually know right because that's uh anyways the point is we have a lot of tools and instruments now that can enhance our senses to see things that we can't necessarily see with our senses but the point is we have some way of detecting things and and putting a measure on them and we say okay this is you know we can prove the existence of of dna and how it works and all this stuff and you don't it doesn't require any faith the whole purpose of the scientific method is that you can know truth without requiring faith to do it right this is why like in the medical field when they're when they're developing medication um they do things like double blind trials where not even the doctor who's giving the medication knows what's the placebo and what's the legitimate medicine because they know the placebo effect is a real thing right if you are giving someone an experimental drug to reduce blood pressure you don't actually know if it works or not but you tell them that they're getting a drug that reduces blood pressure you could be given a sugar pill and it'll still reduce their blood pressure slightly right because they believe it does and so there's this there's this we know the policible effect is a real thing but in order for it to the drug to be accepted you have to show that the actual drug reduced the heart or the blood pressure more than the placebo effect okay in other words you have to prove that the medication works whether or not they have faith in it or not okay i and you know brother branham said that this is you know the medication came from god i believe that's true it's for people who don't have the faith for their own divine healing so they can you have people who don't have the faith for it can still get healing right um so um anyway so the idea is that you the whole purpose of science is you have a faithless you have faithless knowledge right which for people who don't have any faith is really good because they might then they get to know things um but you're not going to know god that way because you have to have some amount of faith no god right you're not going to know god in a faithless manner if you do the only again you're going to have a tree of knowledge understanding of of god which is going to be completely you won't require you to have any faith but it's also not going to be a clear picture of god either it's going to be you're going to be aware of him but you're not going to know him exactly it's a it's a it's a painted fire and so again you have a lot of you have a lot of um you know nominal christians who have some knowledge of god don't actually know god and they have a painted fire now where and a lot of it comes down to what i can prove right what i can prove you know a lot of people will you know watch a documentary about some scientists who prove the existence of god and go well i'm a christian now because i can prove that god exists well he didn't have any faith to do that right you didn't actually get a relationship with god and that's why you're christian you're just doing that because you saw some scientists put their stamp on it right you have no more you have no more faith in that than you would if they if a scientist came along and said that god didn't exist right same amount of faith required for both of those positions the as long as you're basing it on what science can prove the the and so one of the things that i that i noticed was you know a lot of times people in the message will do the same thing they just don't realize this is what they're doing so there's a lot of people in the message will go i believe in the message of the hour because they were miracles right there was it's really you don't have to argue doctrine you don't have to understanding have an understanding of the word of god you don't have to have a any relationship with god to believe in the message of the hour if you just go well it must be true god took a picture with this guy right it's there's not a whole there's not a lot of counter-argument to yeah god took a picture with him though right you don't have to have any sort of understanding of any doctrine that he brought if that if that if you're like well clearly this is this is an empirical thing that i can see i don't have to have any faith in in brother branham's ministry or that there was a divine aspect to it if i see a picture of it right and so people will go you know be like well the message of the hour you know you know the this is the message it's the real word of god and i didn't have to have a relationship with god to know that right they can they can you can have complete recite every doctrine front to back letter for letter word you know word for word 100 perfect and never have had to actually had a single scrap of faith for it right never had to have an actual relationship with god to do it right it's a complete head knowledge it is they have no more um actual relationship with god than the scientist who knows no more about god than what he can see under a microscope right because it was a complete tree of knowledge relationship with god right it is i know this to be the case because i have a piece of evidence to prove it right i saw a picture on the cover of time magazine therefore it must be true it's like okay but do you know that it's true because you had a relationship with god right a lot of people saw the cover of time magazine a lot of people saw the cover of time magazine and believed that god put the cloud there a lot of people believed that until they didn't right a lot of people believed that and they don't believe it anymore because i think his brother jason said this or that's where i heard the first time and it so struck me if you can get talked into it you can get talked right back out of it right if you have some logical empirical relationship with god you can be logically and empirically talked right back out of it right as i know this because i spent enough time in a college lecture hall taking biology courses to know that if you can prove god is real you know through looking at some dna i guarantee you there's some guys out there who can make a pretty solid argument the other way and if you're only if your only uh belief in god is because some scientists told you so and i guarantee you there's some scientists out there who can convince you the other way and if you're if you're only um if your only belief in the message of the hour is because you saw some you you are aware of some sort of supernatural events that are associated with a particular ministry you better be better watch out because all through the message i don't know if any of you guys have um been listening to the uh like ashamed brother brother jason's uh um going through all those uh sermons that uh brother brown preached on the vials um i believe he's actually continuing that today um but if that first really talked about and ashamed this is one particular instance of this brother branham explicitly states at the end time there will be people false anointed ones who will have supernatural signs associated with him and they will be completely anointed of the devil so you'll have a whole lot of people who believe the message only because there's some supernatural associated with it and then as soon as they come in contact with someone who's completely anointed with the devil who can also have supernatural signs associated with them where are they then i mean at the end of the day brother brandon was very clear um if you also want to hear the uh see some more about this um i don't have time to pull the quotes uh right now because i'm only got a couple minutes left but um uh read or listen to spoken words original seed it is six hours long but it is very good um there's actually he's got one of my absolute favorite quotes in there if you have anybody in the ministry where he says um i'm gonna preach for another 20 more minutes and then we'll close and then he preached another four hours um he um so uh he did the absolute ultimate i'm about to close no one will ever beat it um and uh but in there he says over and over and over again repeatedly there will be people at the end who are so close to the very elect it will deceive the very elect if it were possible and he says there we expect there to be supernatural associated with it expect it and because it will be so close to the very elect the he said the only the only actual way to know the difference is to put them to the word test because every seed brings forth of its own kind right what is god saying there in the book of genesis when he says every seed will bring forth of its own kind what are you saying every dna will replicate what it's supposed to replicate right every we we can show that dna that's a type of the word of god in biology right it's what it is every every every letter has to be identical every letter has to be the same you get one letter off you get a disaster right you put them to the word test if they're one letter off from that original seed that god put down you know in the word you're gonna have a problem right it's gonna be off somewhere it's gonna it's gonna you might not see it right now but it'll show up somewhere a lot of times people have um genetic disorders right they had something damaged their genetics a lot of times actually inherited from their parents or grandparents um i believe it's things like um um uh parkinson's genetic disorder you don't know about it till you're 40 unless you took the genetic test but you'll be a perfectly normal life until you're 40 and then everything falls apart well it's what a lot of times people have spiritual parkinson's they got something right when they first came in contact with match of the hour they'll get the whole word except for a few small deviations and because they didn't get the they didn't rectify that soon enough it's somewhere in their foundation of their experience with god is a deviation and it'll be 40 years later and then bang it all falls apart why because the foundation there was some deviation somewhere in that word that they didn't rectify they didn't deal with and it's going to show up later um and so i am now officially a minute over so we'll end it there um and we'll stand and have a word of prayer father we thank you for this time that we would see you in our in the word and in the in the the natural things as well father we know that while climbing that tree of knowledge we may never be able to really know you by climbing the tree of knowledge we do know that we will be able to we can see you all over the tree of knowledge if we're starting with the tree of life and and we thank you father for all these the the beauty that you put into the world and within us we are fearfully and wonderfully made and even every single cell all the billions and billions that make each of our body inside of each and every one of them is a testament to you and to your word and we see that and we thank you for it father and we ask that you would be with us in the coming service father we would create an atmosphere of worship and that we would magnify your name that you would be pleased to dwell among us we ask these things in jesus name amen [Music] do [Music] do [Music] you
