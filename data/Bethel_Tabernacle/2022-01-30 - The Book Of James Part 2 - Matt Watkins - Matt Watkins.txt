TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] do [Music] the book of james and i got quite a bit of feedback from it and i just trust it was a blessing so we just want to go just one step further james chapter 1 and we're just going to begin reading here at verse 1 and you could put that on the screen if you want there we go good james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greeting my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and and abradeth not and it shall be given in him it shall be given him verse 6 but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let no man think that he shall receive anything of the lord a double mind a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways verse 9 let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted but the rich and he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but it withereth the grass and the flower thereof filleth falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways blessed is the man that endure temptation for when he's tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him you can be seated i wanted just to read some passage out of the book of james lest we just teach so much on it we don't cover any of its content and we took last i don't want to recap and spend time recapping too much about the book of james you'll you can get that in the archive if you missed the first part but i thought it was incredible to take uh a human look at this man james and we studied and looked at who he was being that there was multiple james in the bible five different men are called james and we looked at which one of these wrote the book of james and i think it's pretty incredible and profound when you study the bible not just for the divine and for the ethereal and the revelated things but also the bible is a very human book it's a very natural book it has has such a uh there is there isn't a there is absolutely an appeal to doctrine and uh to revelation and to teaching but i believe what makes it to me what makes the bible so special and so true is how human it is how real it is how much it answers your question every day of your life the book of james is really what we could call the most practical book i would say in the entire bible it's just christian living on a practical way but we looked at who this man was and we determined that the writer in my opinion and could be wrong was the brother of jesus and it was amazing looking at the life of jesus and how that his own family his brothers and his sisters didn't recognize him as the messiah through his throughout his entire earthly ministry it wasn't until after the resurrection even the bible speaks about his brothers picking on him and and saying you know this is the time of the feast why don't you go up and make yourself known and they were almost mocking him and it's incredible because the writer of this book of james was one of those brothers who were mocking one of the brothers of jesus his younger brother most likely uh the next yeah then i should say the next youngest yet jesus and then james and james is one of the men who's mocking him and it's amazing because the bible tells us and even his even uh you can go and look in josephus and some of the historical writings he writes about after the after the crucifixion how that the brothers and the siblings and the family are mourning they're they're they can't believe they can't believe what they've done they can't believe how that they've um you know the james i'm sure was pretty ashamed of himself and we talked about last last time how that james says i'm never going to eat again because of how ashamed and the shame that he bore i'm never going to eat another meal i'm just going to he was going to fast but it wasn't going to be a fast that was temporary he was going to fast until he died and just never eat again and and really james if if he would have followed through with what he said he was going to do he would have died and we wouldn't have the book of james it was pretty special when three days later jesus himself appeared to james and and the and james never again calls himself after after that appearing after the resurrection we find james chapter one let's look at it verse one james a servant of god now he's given himself this title and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes so now james views himself as a servant we're gonna pause that just here for a moment just take a little detour here because it's just the way the lord inspired me and just led me to look uh through some of this and we're gonna look at some examples uh in the bible and we're not we're just gonna pause just from the history just for a moment and we're gonna talk about the content of the book it's incredible because everything that you find and i read the entire book of james again before i uh taught last week and it was amazing just notating making notes in my own uh document on james and i would encourage you to do the same go home and read the book of james from the beginning to the end and it's amazing how this testing or trying you could you could really you could call this book of james the acid test it was the test of true christianity because really what is when we say what is true christianity the truest and most purest form remember they were called christians first to antioch so there was something about their life they weren't as it wasn't jewish as acts 15 it's amazing james finds himself in the book of acts and you find the jerusalem council when certain pharisees are saying that you've got to be circumcised like moses and in order to be saved and the bible says they were jews who believed they were jews who believed so they were jews who believed in jesus messianic jews but these the bible says these were of a certain sect and they started teaching the brethren that you must be circumcised to be saved and so paul and paul and peter and barnabas the bible says that they hear of this and and they they hear of this teaching and then you have acts 15 which comes up to this entire meeting it was a minister's meeting and they called a they called a great meeting with paul and barnabas and peter and they're they're really it's it's amazing when you look at just the beginning origin of the christian church how it could have went either way christianity could have just remained a jewish sect or it could be a religion for the entire world and it could have went either way it could have went just as another jewish section if these men would have had their way in the entire jewish council if you read acts 15 is discussing this topic and then you have peter and he speaks and he says brothers the lord has given it to me has given it to me has chosen me that i would take the gospel of christ to the gentiles first and then peter begins to testify and he says and he says and i'm a witness that when they heard the word in the houndies referencing the house of cleopas and he says he says when they when they heard the word they they received it and peter says or the house of cornelius and he says and when they received it peter says the holy ghost fell upon them the same way it did us and peter says and god made no distinction between jew and gentile there was there wasn't some special way that the gentile remember gentile that's a word we use in like a catch phrase word i'm a gentile and you take the you take the woman who says even the dogs you know get the bread from the master's table and so she's referenced as jin as a gentile if you go and look up the word you have jew and gentile i want to just clear this so it's forever clear in your mind what a gentile is you know what a jew is a gentile if you look up the n the meaning for the name in webster's this is what it means not a jew it's all it is we could have had a drum roll but we don't have the drummer out here it just means not a jew that's all it means it's any nation and that's important when you understand the distinction that the the the word of god came to the jews first and it will end with going back to the jews and so you could only come in the old testament you could only get to jehovah by coming through his emissary or his uh his his his representative which was the jewish nation so a gentile just means not a jew that's all it means nothing special not a jew and so they're they're saying this is what the entire jerusalem council was about how are we jews who receive this now how are the gentiles now in order for the gentiles you've got to be circumcised and peter says oh hold on a minute if that were true then why when i preached the word in the house of uh of cornelius they received the word and peter says and the word and he says and the holy ghost fell upon them and they were filled with the holy ghost and it was exactly the same as how me and you how we received it this is what this entire meeting was about and it's amazing because then james speaks up the same writer of this book and now remember he's the half-brother of jesus and he speaks up and and he finds himself and peter paul in galatians references james and calls him the pillar he was the pastor of the first church amazing jesus is brother and and he and james speaks up in any any and he begins to speak we don't have we're going to lose time here we already have i just wanted to take that just for a moment to show you how important of a role this man james served that even in the jerusalem council it was james who really brought them all bro all of the groups together and james begins to tell them to he says what we should do is teach them to abstain from this and so what he's what james is going to do is he's going to teach gentiles how to live amongst jews that's really what it was about but the entire book is about a testing or a trine of what true christianity is because christianity in its purest form is not a church it's not a preacher it's not a belief it's not a prayer it's a life that has lived like christ that is christianity is when you are christ like james covers all of this from the beginning to the end of what it means to have genuine faith genuine christianity and i think it's amazing because when you look at the the value of anything if you're going to measure the intrinsic value of a diamond or the or or of gold or whatever whatever whatever commodity you want to name that would be valuable you would put it through examination you wouldn't just take a jeweler wouldn't just take a uh rubik zirconium is that how you say it cubic thank you shows i i bought a real diamond i didn't buy a fake one i'm just kidding i don't even know what they are i'm just kidding cubic zirconium but a jeweler's not just gonna take a cubic zirconium and say you know here's this you know three or four massive diamond and you give it to him and he just goes oh you know here's here's 10 grand for your for for what you brought no he's gonna he's going to take it back there and he's going to look at it halle jeweler would because he's looking for a quality he's looking for something a quality inside of that diamond because it's the quality of the diamond what's inside of it that could only be seen with the magnifying glass that gives the diamond its value did you catch that it's not what you see on the outside it's what god sees on the inside that gives you your value and you may look and see nothing but god looks through a magnifying glass and says i see me and so to measure you take any diamonds money what are they going to do when you give them a you know a hundred dollar bill or like brother diggs says of ben franklin they're gonna they're gonna take it and they're gonna mark it they're gonna make sure that it's that it's genuine they're going to make sure that it's real they're going to test the value they're going to test the authenticity of that whatever it is it's going to be a metal or gold a silver a diamond money they're going to test it to make sure it's what it says or what it portrays that it is and salvation true christian christ-like uh uh uh a life that's really been transformed by the spirit of god is a life that possesses eternal life eternal life is the greatest commodity in the whole world greater than any diamond or any gold or any silver or any money it's it's it doesn't have a value because it's priceless and so james says in order to determine that you've got that genuine article there's got to be a test there's it's got to be put through a process to determine if you have and let me just say this to have the right relationship and not a church relationship and not a denominational relationship but to have a true relationship a relationships that's that is right a true relationship with the lord that is right is one of the most priceless valuable things you could possess when a church not when a church approves you but when the lord approves what you've got [Music] and so james says we're gonna test it we're going to try it we're going to we're going to see if it's we're going to examine it to make sure it's not wrong to make sure it's genuine psalms 173 getting if you can just follow me closely so we don't have to take the time to turn time is burning right now 10 49. listen to this i just want to read some of these this listen to psalms 173 i'm sorry psalm 17 verse 3 psalm 17 verse 3. this is david speaking here psalm 17 verse 3 thou has notice thou has proved my heart thou has visited me in the night notice what he says thou is prove my heart you visit me in the night thou has tried me and shall find nothing i am purpose that my mouth shall not transgress what is david saying this is that this is that examining that testing you've proved me you've you've tried me you've used me and tried me uh notice in psalms 26 verse 1 and verse 2 psalms 26 you're going to get the same exact thing here with david sand proving he says judge me oh lord man isn't that so opposite of what the world in 2022 don't judge but david says judge me lord i want to be judged i want to be examined i want to be i want you to look at it with your magnifying glass make sure what i've got is real judge me he says for i have walked in in mine integrity i've trusted also therefore i shall not slide judge me examine me prove me test me this is what david is saying try me this is this is what the real this is really what the book of james is about and i believe a christian really has this cry to say lord i want to make sure i have a checkup an examination every day psalms 139 let's look at it just go through a few more of these psalms 139 very very popular one that's familiar psalms 139 examine me search me o god this is psalms 139 he says search me o god and know my heart this is i think verse 23 gideon i have it just in my in my uh yeah search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts says in verse 4 just keep 24. sorry and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting this is what it means to really be a christian when you can say try me search me prove me test me examine me and he says and lead me in the way everlasting this is this is the test and limit lamentations lamentations chapter 3 verse 40 lamentations chapter 3 verse 40. let us search and try our ways and turn again to the lord so what's he saying he's he's admonishing you put yourself to the test put yourself to the test don't we spend so much time testing other people and judging other people and measuring other people but god is saying this is what a true christian wants try me lord start right here examine me try me let us search and try our ways i love that let us search and try our ways chapter 18 of ezekiel ezekiel chapter one more just we'll look at this ezekiel chapter 18 and verse 28. ezekiel chapter 18 verse 28. ezekiel that's ezra sorry notice this ezekiel here ezekiel 28. i want to make sure we are 18 chapter 18 don't want to get it wrong to you ezekiel 18 verse 28. he says because he considered because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgression transgression that he hath committed he shall surely live he shall not die why why is he going to live now and not die because he considereth because he tested because he tried because he thought as david says i thought on my ways i thought on my ways so this is a consideration he says and you don't have to turn you can get it haggai verse chapter 1 verse 5. now therefore saith the the lord of her the lord of hosts consider your ways consider your ways verse 7 and he says consider your ways thus saith the lord of hosts he says it again and repeats it consider your ways think of your life this is really what he's meaning here and you can go through all i'm just going to take a pause just for a moment you can go through all the gospels and you're looking at the life of jesus you could go through all of acts and look at all of the life of the church and we're natured more than geared more this way to consider and ponder the world around us and not the inside of us introspectively when we come to the book of james james is saying you say you're a christian you say you're christ-like you say you're real believer let's really put it to the test and you know what i believe a true christian one who's really been born of the spirit of god you know what they say yes lord that's right yes lord even if i'm wrong like david said if there be some wicked way in me even if i'm wrong when we hear the when we it doesn't matter what form it comes through you open your bible you're hearing what the lord would say to you as we heard our pastor say last sunday you're looking at the mirror this is the mirror of god's word and you don't like what you see whether you hear a tape you turn on a tape and you're listening to god's prophet you hear a sermon through the ministry of the word our attitude should always be lord clean me search me try me root it out like brother branham says i feel s after he gets done gets done preaching he says don't you feel all scoured out and i say lord let it be that when i hear your word and no matter what forms it no matter what form it comes let me say like like like like david said search me try me test me let me make sure i'm in the faith let me make sure i have what i say i have amen let's all stand to her feet this morning amen lord we thank you for this morning sunday school we pray father that you would just take these words root them in our heart lord we believe that your word is true it's for us today specifically lord it it speaks to our problems it speaks to our trials it speaks to
