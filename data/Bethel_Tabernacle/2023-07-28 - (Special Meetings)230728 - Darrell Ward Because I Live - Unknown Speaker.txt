Jesus and count it such an honor to be be with you it's been many years since we've been here but we just appreciate the opportunity that brother Jason gave us and brother Bradley and Sister Sarah letting us stay with them in the beautiful house and all that the Lord's done for us we're just grateful appreciate you coming we trust that when you leave this weekend you'll be closer to God for truly that's why we come I I have no Creed I have no Doctrine I have no message of my own but just Christ and him crucified I met him when I was a young boy and I got away from him got out into the world got into the army and was up at Fort Brag with the 18th Arbor Corp and did things that'd be ashamed for you to know but one [Music] nightl in an Old Barn down in Jonesburg Tennessee is actually on a Sunday afternoon I felt the presence of the Lord come into the room and I I knew it was him because I felt him when I was a boy and he spoke to me he said you go out that door I'll never call you again right there in that old building by myself not in the young people's meeting just there by myself I knelled at that door gave my heart to the Lord Jesus and I told him I said I'll follow you wherever you lead me I'll go Hallelujah so that's why I'm here this weekend and may the Lord richly bless you if you have your Bibles turn with us tonight to the book of First John want to read from 1 John chapter 4 verse 9 and also we'd like to read from Hebrews chap 12:2 but we'll start at 1 John 4:9 do you love him tonight amen so happy to have my wife sister Sheryl with us this weekend it's always good when she gets to travel with me Hallelujah trying to get used to these lights my 1 John 4:9 and the Bible says this in this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him that we might live through himl Hebrews 12:2 the Bible says this looking unto Jesus Jus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God let us bow our heads I want to speak to you tonight for just a few minutes on this little thought of because I live because I live Heavenly Father we love you Lord yes we thank you for all that you've done for us and father I pray tonight that may you speak to every heart may you touch every life Lord May the weak be made strong and may the sick be made well and father those tonight that maybe don't know you may they have Lord that personal relationship with you so father we commit this congregation myself and thy word into your hands For Your Glory bless you children tonight Lord we be careful to give you the honor and the praise and the glory for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says God bless you you may be seated look unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God now referring to the scripture the prophet of God said now God is saying here look unto me look unto me for I am God and there is none other and he said I wonder in a time that we're living in now what could we look to that would be more solid than God all right and God is the word so look to the word of God today for your answer the Bible has the answer for this day and let me say friends we're living in a time that Fox News says that CNN is fake and CNN says Fox is fake and they both say Newsmax is fake and the Democrats say the Republicans are fake and the Republicans say the Dem rats are fake and nobody knows what the truth is anymore but I want you to know tonight there is a truth and the word of God is the truth and the prophet of God said they don't have the answer the Democrats don't have the answer the Republicans don't have the answer come on somebody they do not have the answer but the Bible has the answer for this day it had it for other days and it's got it forever because it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever ever you see we're living in a time that there's no stability in the society as we know it today they have ripped up the foundations of marriage they're destroying the foundations of gender is that not true friends they're blurring the lines between right and wrong and we're living in an unstable Society we're living in a time that the world has absolutely gone insane amen fact the world has gone insane when they don't even know what bathroom to use anymore but I'm so glad tonight that there's another people that's lost their mind Hallelujah we've got the mind of Christ amen because we know what he wants done with his word an unstable Society they've blurred the lines between right and wrong to the point that they don't even know what truth is it reminds me of the days of Jesus we see repeating again in when he stood before Pilate right and pilate looked at him and said what is truth and truth was standing right before him amen and let me say young people the only foundation that is sure the only foundation that is true is the word of God on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand but the word of God is an everpresent help in the time of trouble in a time of trouble a troubl society a troubled nation that we are living in Christ has the answer amen you see when the children of Israel was being bitten by snakes and Moses could not pray for all of them so God told him go and erect the brass Serpent and put it on a pole and they were to look upon that Serpent and live amen and Prophet said let's take the symbol of that the first thing the brass serpent represented was Jesus himself because the serpent represented sin already judged from the Garden of Eden and Jesus was made sin for us knowing no sin knowing no sin but he was made sin for us oh my amen the brass that the serpent was made out of represented Divine judgment brass is divine judgment and the pole of course was the cross and the brass serpent couldn't pray for anyone they was just to look at the brass Serpent and live look and live and that was a type of Christ and if they could look at that type and live how much more can you and I tonight look at the antitype which is Jesus Christ himself we can look to him and live amen amen the only way to live is through Jesus Christ let me say that again the only way to live is through Jesus Christ he is the way the truth and life the life amen you know there's some women in the hotel room up in Canada and the prophet of God was up there in some meetings and he was staying at that hotel and these women come down the hall and they' been drinking and they said they didn't have no shoes on if I remember it right and they had a bottle of liquor in their hand and they were staggering down the hall singing one of them kicked up their leg and said whoopee this is life brother Ben said I couldn't stand it anymore and I stepped out and said that's not life it's death amen hallelujah she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she yet liveth that's not life people strive so much to be popular to be rich there's nothing wrong with having money there's nothing wrong with having a good job in a house but if that's your God that's wrong and people will strive so hard to be famous to be popular to have so many followers on talk Tick Tick Tock or whatever I don't know but to be famous but look where does popularity lead many people they end up hanging theel in a hotel room because that does not give life Hallelujah The Thirst that's in them that was put there by God hallelujah that thirst cannot be answered by Hollywood by popularity by money amen there's only one thing that'll satisfy that thirst that's put in every one of us and that's Jesus Christ she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she yet liveth for the Bible said for as Adam as in Adam all died even so in Christ shall all be made alive you see from the time we were conceived we were dying amen I don't care if you're 188 or 80 we're dying from the time we were conceived in our mother's boom We Were Dying think about that you look at me I'm 63 year old soon be 64 most of my life has done been lived you can look but we was talking back there back in 1997 58 whatever it was brother Jason preached Easter up there at home and had her picture made out in the parking lot standing beside each other just young men but look at us today well he looks better than me but you get the point look at me today because we're dying we're dying and the prophet said you were born defeated wow and that birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated you're in a defeated World amongst defeated people amongst defeated Creeds defeated denominations but you've got to come to Victory some way but let me tell you there has to be a Victor before there can be a Victory amen and I say look unto him and live amen what did he do then the prophet said he embraced the cross and on the cross he died for me and for you amen and for the world that he might restore us back again to God as what Sons and Daughters of God Christ came to bring us back to a rightful position to what God had of us in his mind Hallelujah before there was a world before there was a star he knew your name he knew the color of your eyes and the color of your hair how don't make somebody say hallelujah hallelujah to do what to bring us back again the Sons and Daughters of God the prophet said oh if people could only see that if I could only pound that into the people that Jesus died that he might take the people away from this hybrid Church stuff he didn't die to make us a bunch of church members he didn't die to make us a denomination to make us an organization but to bring us back to our rightful position as Sons and Daughters of God Amen that he might bring your minds and Faith away from this what man has said back to what God said let me tell you Visions will fail you prophecies will fail you man will fail you family will fail you Nations will fail you but the word of God will never fail you God keeps his word not 99 times out of a 100 but 100 times out of a 100 God keeps his word yes sir bring it back to not what man said but back to what God Said not a hybrid Faith well maybe the days of Miracles has passed well maybe it won't happen it'll never happen with that kind of attitude that's not Faith come on somebody well maybe it won't happen maybe you know it's not for me maybe healing not for me it'll never happen like that Jesus never died that we would have a weak faith that we would have a hybrid Faith well I don't know if it'll work or not but he died to bring our faith back to what God Said Hallelujah where is the resting place of our faith tonight not on what man said on what God Said Amen Jesus never died that we'd have a weak Faith or a hybrid faith I don't know if it'll work or not but he died to bring our faith back to what God said because remember the Bible says heavens and earth shall pass away but the word of God shall fail you amen amen amen then where does our faith rest tonight on the word of God go with me tonight let's just take a little trip H you know maybe you know I'm not used to I just have to be myself okay but go with me tonight let's let's take a little trip you want to go with me we find our self in a garden and we see over here they are three men and they're laying under a tree sleeping and we go about a stone throw away and we hear the voice it is the voice of a man his voice voice is trembling he's in great Agony and we can hear by the tone of his voice he's afraid this is the voice of Jesus brother darl you say Jesus was afraid the Bible said he was Hebrews 5:7 who in the the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared we see that he's sweating and his sweat is turning to Great drops of blood you see there's a medical condition that's known as hematosis and hematosis is where the capillaries that feed the sweat glands they actually rupture and the blood seeps into the sweat glands and a man will actually sweat blood hematosis happens it happens under extreme physical and mental stress amen Luke being a position he catches this understanding and he writes about it so that we may know and Luke writes in 22:24 he said that he that being in agony and the word agony you know what that means it means a struggle for [Music] victory before there could be a victory there must be a Victor and we find him here in anguish struggling for Victory amen Luke said he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground we notice he's praying said father if there be any other way please let this cup pass from me Mark 14:36 he said Abba Father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what I will but what thy will all things you're God you can do anything surely there could be another way don't make me drink this cup you see from the time he was a little little boy he had seen crucifixions and Rome knew how to inflict punishment on the prisoners and they would crucify him out on the roadway so that we we walk by you could see them on the cross and you would say if you mess with Rome this is what you get and from the time he was a little boy he saw men hanging on crosses and not only that he was the word and being the word he knows all things and he says father you're God you can do anything don't make me drink this cup and he gets up and he goes to his disciples and where does he find them asleep and he wakes up Peter and he says Peter wait wake up Peter Just Master what's the matter you're Satan I've never seen you like this I've seen you walk on the water I've seen you raise the dead I've seen you feed 5,000 but I've never seen is that blood is are you bleeding Peter Peter watch with me Peter watch with me pray Peter would you pray with me the Bible says he goes again and he falls upon the ground and he begins to pray and Peter's saying what shall I pray what do you want me to pray the Bible said he went again a second time and he prayed saying oh father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it th will be done and the prophet said a conference was called and the father he said Gabriel come down sat on the Rock wormwood came down all the other Angels came down and began to sit around in the garden then he said that Pillar of Fire came down a conference was called and the father said are you willing is your love for your brethren great enough is your love for that sinful stinking world that you were born in do you love him enough to forfeit your life do you love them enough to take their place to Bear their sin the hardest cruelest death they will cut you to pieces they will drain every drop of blood from your body the prophet said there could be nothing that could die that kind of death but him and in that conference such a decision was made until the blood dropped from his brow that he was under such a strain and the sins of the world was upon him my sins was upon him your sins upon Him amen whether we're eight or whether we're 80 tonight our sins was upon Him brother said oh can we have that decision in our hearts tonight can you forfeit that little filthy life of yours are you willing to look in his face and say not my will I'm a drunker but I'll drink no more I'm a gambler but I'll gamble no more I'm immoral but I'll be immoral no more I'm a liar but I'll stop it today I'm a foul person but in this conference tonight I'll look into your face and I will do like my master I will take like my master who died for me to make my way clear and I will say to him not my will but your will be done in my life and the prophet said after the father had spoke to him then Here Comes Satan you see Satan spoke to him just like he tries to speak to us after you have a good service and you feel God in then when you get out in the parking lot or when you get home then Satan will tell you oh that was just emotion you never got nothing God don't care for you but you know what you need to tell the devil you know people come all the time up for prayer and they say brother Daryl the devil told me this and the devil told me that and the devil said this and the first thing that comes to my mind is why do you listen to him you know he's a liar he can't tell the truth they can't quote two good quotes they can't quote one good Bible scripture but they can tell you everything the devil said to them you know sometimes I think we need to tell the devil why don't you s down and shut up well brother darl we don't say shut up around here we teach our children not to say those kind of things well then tell him to hush tell him something I said tell him something let your voice be heard when he tries to remind you of your past you need to remind him of his future Hallelujah you need to tell him I can't wait for the day I see you thrown into the Lake of Fire you have lied to me you have tormented me you have Afflicted me but one day oh sord I will see you no more Hallelujah so after the father got done talking here comes Satan the hiss of the serpent Satan begin to talk it's too much oh it's too much he's asking too much of you is it really fair that you should die for something they done you never lied you never stole you never looked at something on the Internet you shouldn't look at am is it really fair that you should die for their sins he's asking too much it's far far too heavy the burden that you must carry is too heavy save yourself but you see if he saved himself he could not save you save yourself do you think that in 2023 in Buford South Carolina that there'll be any young people there that will even care what you're fixing to do in that world when everything is instant this and instant that and there's so much information being pounded into their head do you think they'll ever take the time to even care well I'd like to tell the devil tonight I don't know about you but as for me in my house we still care come on somebody can I get a witness can I get an amen from somebody I want the devil to know I still care it still mean something to me what he was willing to do that I could live come on somebody can you say Amen Satan we still care [Applause] Hallelujah the prophet said there was a time after a perfect life of 33 and a half years he had lived a man who wanted to live as much as you and I want to live a man who had something to live for Brethren that he loved people that he loved they sat around the campfire with the disciples they say Peter tell me a good fishing story who don't like a good fishing story and they would sit around and laugh and maybe talk about the time Peter fell out of the boat or whatever it would be and just laugh and slap one another on just as we get around and have a good time in a fellowship hall they were just sitting around the campfire enjoying each other's company enjoying life he loved their Fellowship he loved sunsets he liked to watch the sun set up on the water and satting there watch watching the disciples laugh slap each other on the shoulder he realized sitting there watching them enjoying life he realized the only way they could live was for him to die he remembered the words he spoke yet a little while the world will see me no more but ye shall see me ye shall see me because I live ye shall live also you see he realized he was the only one who could fulfill that scripture Peter couldn't do it Moses couldn't do it Daniel couldn't do it Isaiah couldn't do it brother brandom couldn't do it brother brother Jason couldn't do it brother Brad couldn't do it only him it all came down to him the only way that these could live the only way that he could ever enjoy the fellowship he would have to die oh God the only way that he could ever gather together again as brothers was for him to die and to resurrect so that they could follow in his steps and there in the Garden of Eden has he sweating it out it's the only place you ever see his will ever come into focus it was always I come to do the will of my father I come to do the will of he who sent me I do nothing except my father show me first this is the only place you find him ever wrestling out his own will that's right if there be any other way Lord if there be any of your God you can do anything don't make me drink this cup but there in that conference he realized he was the only one who could do it amen and there he surrendered his will and he said not my will let thy will be done and he steps into the will of the father and they arrested him and all night long without sleep without water without food amen they tried him he said I hid not my back from the smiters nor my cheeks from those who pluck the hair from my face I hid not my face from the spit and from their shame friends you know as as well as I do if I walked up to you and went you would oh yeah amen but he said I hid not my face from their spit all night long they smacked him and tried him without sleep without rest without water without food and they took him from Pilot's Hall and they tied him to a whipping post and they took these rods and they begin to strike him on his back and those rods would break the capillaries into the skin it would cause deep bruising and then after they broke it all up in his back till it was just one great bruise they took the canine Tails a whip with pieces of bone and pieces of glass and they would strike him into the back and they would rip it like that and it would rip open great wounds and the blood because the capillaries had broke into the skin the blood would gush out of his body Paul said I got 39 I got 40 Stripes minus one five different times but there was nobody here counting the stripes there was nobody saying that was enough they struck him and struck him until they had to take over and somebody else had to swing the whip stripe after to stripe until they caused deep wounds in his back that you could actually see his kidneys through the gaping wounds of his back oh God but the Bible says for the joy set before him he endured the cross what was on his mind what was he thinking as they whipped him at the whipping post oh God he starts up Calvary the prophet God said I can see him His Garment a spot of red here and a spot of there until it becomes just one bloody garment slapping against his legs and they take him up Calvary and they throw him down and they take this arm he bend it way back like this and drive it into the board and then they take this arm way back like this and drive it into the board and then they had a platform where they put their feet and they crossed his legs and drove a nail into both of his feet on this platform and then they raised him up into the air like this and he dropped him into a hoe in the ground and the Bible said all my bones are out of joint you see his arm stretched out like this and out like this and the way they had that when he went into the ground it dislocated his shoulders anybody have a dislocated bone it's one of the most painful things ask Brother Brad he was in surgery people come in with a dislocated shoulder or a dislocated hip you have to put them asleep to put it back in place because they cannot stand the pain and let me tell you it wasn't just his help but the Bible said all my bones amen are out of joint they came up me with their mouths they waged their heads they shoot out their lips oh God he was cut to Pieces the Bible said his face was disfigured more than any man's face had ever been disfigured before when you looked at him you couldn't even tell who he was amen where they had smacked him and beat on him and no one was there to stop him no one was there Peter James John no when he stretched him out like this it would stretch the diaphrag and it caused where you couldn't get a deep breath so you would actually smother while you hung on the cross but Rome put a platform there so that you could push yourself up and when you pushed yourself up it would relax the diaphragm enough for you to get some breath so hanging there between the heavens and the Earth bleeding with the spit he would push up when he couldn't hold it up no longer he would go back down like this and he would SMUD smother smother did and he' go down and he'd smother and his mother said he was a man when he died at Calvary for sacrifice bleeding the blood running out of him like a mortal spit hanging all over his beard he was a man disgraced hanging in shame taking our place he was a man and when the pain got so great when the pain got so great he couldn't bear it anymore he pushed up on the cross my God my God what now for forsaken me be not far from me oh Lord help me I'm dying I'm dying a man bleeding on a cross why are those so far from helping me from the words of my roaring help me a man forsaken by God the prophet said a curse hanging on a tree everything forsook him even the very creation he created was forsaken him the moon the stars the sun everything blotted off man God nature everything forsook him nothing standing there he died alone let me tell you young people there might have been days that you felt like you was so all alone that you couldn't take another moment there may have been times that you felt like nobody cared for you and nobody loved you and nobody understand you I guess all of us has felt that way from one time or another but let me tell you the worst day of our life the worst day of my entire life has never been like this day has the stars ever forsook us has the moon one time ever failed to shine its light for us oh Hallelujah has the son ever hid its face from us but it did him the prophet said what was on his mind what was he thinking about how how was he bearing the pain he labored so we could rest he suffered so we could be healed he died so we could live he was forsaken that you and I could say tonight you promised me you'd never leave me nor would you forsake me he pressed up on the cross a thirst of thirst you see there's a condition known as hypo Valic shock hypovolemic shock is when the body loses so much fluid that it'll take the fluid that's left and pull it into the vital organs like your liver and your kidneys and your in your heart to keep you alive and he hanging there on the cross he said my tongue it cleaveth into my jaw what was he experiencing hypovolemic shock he was going into shock that's why he was so thirsty his body was craving fluid because all his blood was spilled out on the ground you can look all around the cross it was just one bloody Hillside he said my tongue because the moisture of his mouth had all dried up he said my tongue it cleaveth to my jaw I thirst a thirst his body was dying and they ran and got vinegar on a sponge and they tried to give him a drink but he refused it he refused to drink the vinegar because it was like an anesthetic you see he wanted to fill it all he wanted to fill every bit of it for you his body was dying and the Bible says for the joy for the joy set before him Joy brother Dan does that sound like Joy what I've just described to any of you does that sound like joy joy is apple pie with vanilla ice cream that's Joy fellowship with your friends and laugh that's Joy how could this be joy for the joy what Joy why was he willing to pay such a price for the joy what was the joy what what's the joy would you have done that would you have done that would you if a motorcycle gang pulled out here in front so we're going to kill everybody in the building or send one man out and we'll kill him and the rest of you can go home which one of you would go would you go hey buddy how you doing would you go how about you would you go y'all sit still sister Brenda sit still I'll I'll go out there you just sit right there I'll go you see what I'm saying friend do you see what I'm

you praising him and loving him he saw you changed he saw you healed he saw you free he saw you delivered he saw you restored he saw you redeemed do you realize what he saw he saw you hallah and he said you're worth it for the joy Hallelujah for the joy of healing he endured the whipping post for the joy of seeing you saved he endured the shame and the rejection and the humiliation and the pain and the suffering for the joy of hearing the shout in the camp [Music] Hallelujah we pull up here while ago out on a what what is that 26 out there 20 21 out there at the Marine Corps that sign out there was the entrance yall you've seen that sign before a you said part of the noise but it's the sound of Freedom oh friends I don't care if you see you may laugh at me because I shout you may laugh

the shame the rejection the humiliation the pain the suffering from the joy of hearing the shout of victory in the camp he endured the cross the joy set before him is us our Salvation that's the prize and made it all worthwh that's why he was willing to suffer the shame so that we could make it into his kingdom he endured the cross so that you and I could be given eternal life this is the joy that was set before Jesus that he could share this life he possessed amen with us so that he could say where I am there will you be also amen you see The Thirst in his heart would not be filled with water from a spring amen it would not be filled with vinegar from a sponge but the only thing that would satisfy that hunger the only thing that would satisfy that longing that was in his heart was for your fellowship amen think about it as I as I close he had one suit of clothes my God I don't know how many suits I've got in my closet and he had one but he never asked the father for one new suit never he never asked the father for a new garment he walked everywhere he went but not one time did he ever ask the father for a chariot to make his journey a little easier he said the birds have nest and the foxes have burls but I the son of man have no place to lay my head he never had a house he never had a house but he never asked a father for a place to live he never asked for a new suit he never asked for a chariot he never asked for a house the only thing he ever asked for was our fellowship the joy that was set before him was to see you sitting here and receiving that day at Calvary because on that Resurrection morning he realized what he had done fulfilled the prophecy of his scripture amen when he said because I live because I live ye shall live also now now because I've done this we can be together we can sit around the father's table again we can laugh and slap each other on the shoulder we can not just have life we can have eternal life it'll never end the joy will never endall and because I live because I live Hallelujah you shall live also every person in this building tonight on that cross that day when he pushed up he go it is finished when he said that every prison door in hell every prison door that Satan tried to lock up God's people every door come open and I tell you tonight no matter what Satan's got you Bound in pornography or this or that or whatever that he's trying to hold hold you back in let me tell you tonight that prison door has been opened and Jesus is saying because I live you can live also let me tell you if you're sick if you're blind or Hallelujah if you're lost if you're bound you can go free tonight you can step out of Satan's prison house you can break that chain no you can't break it it's already broke the chain is already [Applause] broke he said he said that I could go amen free free Hallelujah and this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him you thought I was worth sa so you came and changed my life you thought I was worth keeping so you clean me up inside you thought I was to die for so you sacrificed your life so I could be free so I could be whole so I could tell everyone I know you thought I was worth [Music] saving do you believe that tonight Joy what was the joy it was you it was you you see if he was the only one in the history of humanity that was ever lost he would went to Calvary and died for you if you was the only person in the history of humanity that was ever sick he would have took every stripe on his back for your healing you see he just didn't die for the world no no no don't just group it into all that he did but just bring it on down bring it on down he died for you he thought I was worth saving do you love him tonight let us about it well brother Daryl I thought we'd be shouting tonight well let's all get right and then we can shout we have something to shout about oh

the way we came in that's you can go free you can go free you're not long ago I've told it many places but it's touched my heart I was in chac Alaska chac Eskimo Village about 150 M below the Arctic Circle you can stand you ever been up there to chac you can stand at CHC you can see the curvature of the Earth it's just a unique place there's a young girl come up there Eskimo girl 21 year old she said brother Daryl I'm an alcoholic she said I have tried everything to quit drinking she said I've been through the nstep program three different times and I go clean for a while then I find myself drunk again since I got a little boy that I don't even know who the daddy is because it was conceived while I was drunk she said I've tried everything to quit drinking but I cannot quit drinking tears running down her face and I said sis have you tried Jesus amen I said you just give Jesus that alcohol and you take his freedom and you go out free and I begin to pray pray for her friends I'll never forget it she began to scream she wasn't pretending she meant it she began screaming from the top of her lungs I'm free I'm free I'm free Hallelujah I was up out here not long ago she came up to me she said brother darl it's been two years and I'm still sober because you see who the son hath made free is free indeed how many's free tonight may the Lord bless you richly you thought I was worth [Music] saving so you came and changed my life you thought I was worth keeping so you clean me up inside you thought I was to die for so you sacrificed your life so I could be free so I could be whole so I could tell everyone I know you thought I was [Music] [Applause] a so you came and changed my life you thought I was worth keeping so you clean me up inside you thought I was to die for so you sacrificed your life so I could be free so I could be whole so I could tell everyone I know you thought I was worth saving oh are you glad for that you came and changed my life thought I was worth keep he's worthy of thanks and pra so you clean me up inside you thought I was to die for so you sacrificed so you sacrificed your life so I could be free so I could be Hallelujah so I can tell everyone I know every everyone everyone I can tell everyone about Freedom you know what you heard tonight friends you heard the oldest originalist is that a word the very first form of the Gospel that ever went out to the world Jesus died to save Sinners Hallelujah that God so loved the world sent his son my brother R said God lived and his son came and took took death upon himself he who knew no sin became sined you know why he had never committed a sin but he had you had and he took it all and brother brandham says God judged him a sinner and sent him to hell that's right he went into the straight into the lower parts he that ascended is the same that first descended into the lower parts of the earth said God judged him a sinner and sent him to hell you know why friends you know why so you and me would never have to go I just say blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord he's worthy of Praise I'm glad we have a victory I'm glad that we have a Victor so we can have Victory I I like having Victory my I remember hearing a a man testified one time I was young myself it so moved my heart and he was so sincere with it he was just telling just a simple gospel and he's looked out in that audience and I was sitting out of that audience and he said he said one day he said I I realized that I was dying and on my way to hell and there was nothing I could do about it but God loved me and Christ saved me and he said I had no way to turn it around but the Lord loved me that much and and turn my life around that's why friends that's why you know I I I I believe that this gospel it should be told constantly and you know something it's not a cheap gospel I think you heard tonight I think you'd agree with me hearing brother Daryl describe all of that detail I just say brothers sisters we can never let this gospel become a cheap gospel this gospel is dripping with the blood of Martyrs it's dripping with the blood of Christ Hal huah it's worth serving it's worth living for I believe that friends and I I thought to myself as brother Daryl was preaching I thought you know I I'd always said to myself you know he saw me the Bible says that he he'll see his seed and be satisfied he saw me but as brother Daryl took it a step I had never quite taken in my mind he didn't just see me he saw me free he saw me finished he didn't see me b bound he didn't he didn't die so as Brother D said so you could have weak Faith he didn't die so you could be bound he died so you could be free am he didn't die so you could be a slave to the devil he died so you could be Sons and Daughters of God oh my I'm here to tell you that's worth something to me he died so that I could be healed so that I could be free and so that I can be strong my I love any anytime I hear the story of that day on Calvary I want to tell you something friends that has tugged at my heart since a boy I I never tired of hearing about that day on Calvary it changed my whole life I see Jesus surrendering in that Garden you know friends I want to tell you something I really believe that Jesus was able to surrender in Gethsemane I've thought this for years he was able to surrender there because he had spent his whole life surrendering he surrendered his way all the way to a surrender how could he go to Calvary he had been going to Calvary since a child he had always did that which pleased the father I thought to myself tonight I thought you know I'm I've been my whole I'm in an order of ascending and I've been ascending for a long time and one of these days soon I'm going to ascend right off the surface of the Earth Hallelujah you know why cuz I'm I'm already ascending I'm making sure that my life is going up how many want to go with me oh you would have no chance to go had it not been for what you heard tonight that day changed everything for the world amen amen so I can tell everyone I know let's sing that again brother K one more time you thought I was worth worth
