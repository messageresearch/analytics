go straight to the word amen this evening god bless you amen i just trust that you came hungry tonight wanting to receive something from the lord believe he has something amen good for us genesis chapter 1 and we'll just read one verse verse 27. we'd like to just continue on where we were a few wednesdays ago on bride character genesis chapter 1 verse 27 so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them heavenly father we thank you lord for the reading of your word tonight knowing god that your word is a seed lord and that when it's planted in good ground lord that it brings forth your purpose it brings forth lord your life so we just ask god right now lord as we have worshipped you lord and lord the church is saying and we've played our music lord we used our voices to lift praises to your name lord we pray father now you would come lord and take over father lord may you just minister your word to your children lord may that seed lord that's the word fall upon good ground tonight god i pray that you'd give us ears to receive lord father i pray that you'd be with us in all things in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated tonight we'd like to just pick up right where we were where we left off on bride character and i i would subtitle this a few different titles but i just didn't have one that was real clear and so we're just going to go with part two of this i want you to notice and without recapping so much of what we covered uh the first time we spoke on this we're going to just touch and highlight some of it that we spoke on and then just move to something else if the lord would be our help tonight genesis 1 chapter chapter 1 verse 27 have that up if you could and hold it in your bible i want to just uh to look there again hold your place there in genesis chapter one we're going to read it just one more time so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them so what's amazing when you look at the creation and the creation account that you find here when god is creating man you notice that god didn't create any of the animals in the likeness of himself but he created each animal with their own nature he created each animal with their own image and we identify today an animal and in every specie uh you could identify by the way that it by the way that it's built its anatomy but the bible says that about man he was different and and and he wasn't like an animal the world today uh secularism wants you just to believe that we're we're just animals that that's what a a a a human being is you know even i was reading today uh an answer on the internet just from someone who posted decora you know what is the what is the isla i think the question was is life a blessing or is life a curse and this uh this really uh sophisticated person got on there to give this long diatribe about how that life is neither it's neither a blessing nor a curse it's just the uh the natural uh evolution that we're just made up of gases and materials from the earth and life doesn't have a purpose it doesn't have a meaning we're just an animal you know where we have the same all nature that you see in the world there's a predator there's a prey and he was using that to say that you know a world is that's what life is really about we're just another animal and we all have a predator instinct and and then there's there's those that are the predator and then those that are the prey and uh and he went on to say how that you know that that if you're lucky and you're blessed and you're you know in life and you're skilled and talented maybe greater than some of the other animals then you become the predator but if you're less fortunate and you know you're not you're small and and you know and you don't have a lot of strength and you don't have a lot of ability or a lot of talent well then you're just the prey and and i just read that answer and it was much longer i'm just condensing much longer and you know and and very uh very articulate the way he put it all out there and i i thought just like the apostle paul i thought you know if if if if i didn't have god i would be of all men most miserable if i didn't have an understanding of what the purpose of the meaning of life is and and god creates man with the knowledge even the bible speaks of that and says that there's a knowledge of the creator inside all humanity but the bible says that god was that god created man and he creates him in his own image or in his own likeness genesis 2 verse 7 we want to read in genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul so the first here was the first original human being here was adam as he was formed and the bible says he takes of this lump of clay any any any and he takes this lump of clay he begins to uh as a great architect as a great designer as a great uh engineer a great artist you could think of all the ways you want to describe this creator but he was he was creating this creation to be in his own image and in his own likeness and the bible says and then he breathes into man uh into his nostrils the breath of life and then it becomes a living soul and so man is is formed and created uh and i could imagine this this man adam was very different than what we are today in a sense very different uh because we know that we're we're we are while we're homo sapien we're a human being but as adam adam was not under a curse adam was not under a disease he was not he there was no sin uh he was he was perfect he was he was you could you could describe him as beautiful uh he was he was just a because you say how because god created him and so god creates him perfect he creates him in beauty he doesn't create him with any flaw he doesn't create him with any defect there's no there's no uh there's nothing lacking in this perfect man uh he was he was he wasn't he couldn't perish life today we're perishing today we're corrupting today all of us every single one of us even the little babies that are here today uh they they're young and they're full of life and they're growing but at the same time there's a law there's a curse that they're under in this human body there's a curse of sin and we're living under the cycle of corruption and if the lord tarries all of our bodies we'll corrupt to the point of death and will go into the ground into a grave and that's the that's that's you say what is that from sin that that that that is that is what we that's what we call pair we're perishable today but adam was not perishable there wasn't there he he had he lived his what he breathed was eternal life because his life came from his father and you say what what was adam was he uh when god created him was he 30 was he 40 was he he wasn't a baby we know that he didn't god didn't form him and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he was a little baby no he was but he wasn't an old man either amen he was a perfect man this is why we have we struggle we try to describe this but we struggle because we don't live that's not us we come into this world as a baby and as we go through life we age and we get sick and our body begins to break down but adam was in the prime of life we could say that he was perfect in his in his in in and and brother branham when he goes beyond the curtain of time and he doesn't really give a an exact you know age he just says somewhere you know about 18 to 20 in the prime of life maybe 20 years old you know and just the perfect prime of life he said that's how they all were living he was trying to describe something that for us we really can only imagine that's right so he wasn't a baby he wasn't an old man but we know he was he was in he had he had perfect youth and and you that's why we say you know you're the what is heaven it's just a big youth meeting it's a big young people's gathering and and and when you have youth you have strength you have energy you have vitality you're you're healthy there's no it's it's prior to your back hurting it's prior to any uh you know any diseases that you get you you're you're young today you're young only only once and so in that youth there's health and there's strength and then you know at some point you start to have to fight to to maintain that health and and and that strength and that strength begins to to fail but adam adam could walk you say what was adam he was he was a miniature god he was he was the god of earth god was jehovah was the god of heaven adam was the god of earth adam could walk on water adam could cr adam could con nothing that god could do adam couldn't do adam could do anything god could do he was a god man he was perfect he could he could he could he had his he was in the likeness of his father notice he was in the likeness of his father his father wasn't in his likeness we don't say you know man your son looks just like you you know where we don't say you look just like your son we say your son looks just like you because the the the the genes are passed down they're not passed up and so it was in the likeness of god he looked like god he spoke like god he could he could say to a tree to be picked up and planted over here and let me say this it was it was part of his nature to have faith it was part of his nature to believe that's who he was you know and and so opposite of us here today because it's not natural for you to have faith and believe this it's very natural for you to have doubt and disbelief that comes as part of your nature you say brother matt well i've been born again well i trust that you have so now that now that we can classify you as born again now let me tell you what's natural to you doubt let me tell you what's natural to you fear it's normal you say for a believer yeah for a believer that's what comes as your first instinct your first instinct is doubt you have the word of god the promises of god it takes faith to believe the word of god but for adam he didn't have to quench or he didn't have to strain he didn't have to read enough for the word of god he didn't have to say i'm just going to believe it i'm going to i'm going to step out on faith it was natural for adam to believe it was part of who he was it was part of his makeup it was it was part of his first nature whereas for us our first nature even as as christians even as believers it is in our first nature to react and doubt and disbelief hello all you angels here maybe i'll just preach to those on the internet all of y'all humans out there it's natural for us to doubt that's part of our nature it's natural for us to get upset that's part of our nature thank you brother it's it's you know say brother matt how can you say that because here's what else is natural it's very natural for you to get sick but i'm born again will you still get sick anybody still get sick still get a headache and say well i'm healthy will you still get a headache still get backaches why you say brother matt why is that because that's part of even as a christian even as a believer it's part of your nature because you're under a bodily curse right but for for adam there was no curse faith was natural to adam he could speak the word of god and he didn't have to think about it it just came to him because it was it was part of his makeup it was part of who he was it was part of what he believed for us our nature is the opposite of that our first reaction is to get angry our first reaction is to doubt our first reaction is to have fear but but god so so the same way that adam was a human but in every way in the likeness of god we are the direct reverse of what adam was and so for us we we come and we believe the word we we we give our life to to jesus christ and god indwells us with the spirit and we now we have the spirit of god but yet we still have this carnal nature yet we still have this second part of us that's always there it's always there and so brother branham said it this way he said he said you he said jesus came into the world very different than how you and i came into the world and he said he came straight from thought from theophany he says but you you came into this world as a seed of god that's eternal that's down on the inside of you but you came into a into it in a body of time and and he begins to describe this body of time and this is you know what this is very easy for us to comprehend we think he turned we think uh you know you know you know what's hard for us to comprehend is eternity we preach about eternity we believe in eternity but there's only one part of us that believes in eternity the inner man the inner man believes that the the inner man doesn't struggle with it but the outer man struggles with it but but for for for us time is very natural and time is so different uh than eternity when you look at this even and i don't need you to turn i'm just gonna brush i'm just gonna look at this just really quick and just brush over some of these scriptures ecclesiastes solomon says that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and god that's that's just amazing when you just think about what he just now said there that which hath been is now and that which is to be in other words tomorrow next year next month the election coming up in in a few days has already been amen now he's speaking from a perspective of eternity here this is the perspective that adam and eve lived in it was a perspective of eternity not time it wasn't until a curse comes and that mankind falls and now eternity is broken and now time begins under a curse amen are you following here and so now man lives by time he measures his days he measures his life his life is but uh is literally measured and you look at we we measure everything by time everything is what we'll do tomorrow and what's going to ha what happened last week and what's going to happen next week but adam didn't think about what's going to happen next year or the next moon because there wasn't none it was all just life and heaven there is no there is no time uh what will happen next week or next year or next month it's just eternity it's life listen what what he says here and and notice what he what what solomon says because he's he's he's he's he begins to to speak about this and he says something that's so amazing at this when he begins to talk about this concept of eternity he says here and and this is just a different translation of the same verse whatever is has already been and what will be has been before and god will call the past to account he another translation says what now is has already been what is to be already is god retrieves what has gone by he brings the past back at judgment what's he doing he's bringing the past back we can't go in the past god can and so he says whatever was whatever will be is that's how it's always with god because uh for us we have a hard time understanding the idea or the concept of eternity because we're bound by a law called time we live in that law of time we go we measure everything by by years and then by months and then by days and then by hours and then by seconds and then we've broken it even further down into milliseconds and everything's measured by time and how much something how long something takes we go through life by time second by second minute by minute and you can't stop it you can't stop time i would if i could many times we'd stop time and freeze everything but we can't do that but and and we can't stop it we can't we can't make time go faster can't speed it up can't speed up the process you you can't allow you can't make it go forward you can't make it go backwards because we're trapped under this curse we're trapped under this curse of sin and beyond all that and everything for us has a beginning and everything has an end but according to what the bible says time is just a temporary thing that god allowed but one day god will say time shall be no more and so god at one time will say time is no more the time time is all of the all of history as we've taught before here history is just his story break it up so all of history from yesterday today and tomorrow is just his story but his story had a beginning and a story is going to have an end but i'm part of the story that had no beginning and i'm part of this i'm part of the story that has a beginning and end but i also am part of the story from eternity i'm part of the part of the story that has no beginning or end that's right [Music] you try to grasp that your mind blows up where did i come from who who am i really where did where is my origin where am i really from amen you know when did my life really begin when is it really going to end so it's all by time we measure it let me just find my place here we we measure it by time but god god comes god the the the god is from eternity the bible says that he's from age to age everlasting that's why god could say i am the i am in other words not just the i was or i'm going to be but who are you i'm moses said are you i'm the i am right now you can't no you can't describe that i am the i am i am and i always was and i always will be i'm the uh i'm the i i i the i'm the past i'm your past i'm your present i'm your future i'm yesterday i'm today and i'm forever is that what the bible says about jesus christ he's the same yesterday he's the same today he's the same forever he's called the i am he can move forward he can move backwards in time and he sees all of it not literally like we do here today but he sees the end from the beginning amen and he sees it as if it's happened already and he sees it as if it's happening now and he sees it as if it's about to happen all three because he the concept of time is only natural to us but to god it's all already happened why does the bible says the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world revelations 13 the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world wasn't that the lamb was slain it was that all of it was already done it's already finished in the mind of god even when jesus says that it is finished what's he speaking of a block a spot something has taken place in time and now that part of that ministry is is finished there's a completion of redemption but what was god saying when he said the the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world god was saying it's it was already a completed work before man ever sinned and needed redemption redemption was already provided before man was ever lost there was already a savior to save him amen he says here in isaiah 46 verse 10 and i don't want to take too much time on this he says in isaiah 46 verse 10 i make known the end from the beginning listen to this very closely i know you've heard this before but listen now let's word it here i make known this is this is the king that's the king james this is the new international version i make known the end from the beginning from ancient times what is still to come i say my purpose will stand and i will do all that i please amen so we have this concept of time but god looks at it from eternity he sees all of time as if it's happened already it's happening now and it's going to happen he sees it already done and already accomplished why do you think you fear where did fear come from because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow you don't know what what waits for you you don't know what's going to happen to your children you don't know how this problem is going to work itself out and so you're fearful how am i going to take care of this you don't know who's going to pay the bill on friday but for god there is no fear because he already sees the answer it's already finished it's already completed it's already signed sealed delivered it's completed your salvation your redemption the the your inheritance with god is already completed and now all god has to do is get you in line and align you in and sync you up with his eternal vision so he says he has made everything this is ecclesiastes 3 11. ecclesiastes 3 11. he has made everything notice this here so god sees everything as if it's happened already already accomplished all the events the election is already over in the mind of god you know what he knows who wins who you think's going to win oh i don't know i think i think biden's got it i don't know i think trump you know i think 2000 you see what's going on god doesn't have those conversations it's already decided it's already set up he's already commanded it it's already taken place so if he's not worried why would we be worried if he's not fearful why would we be fearful we either put our life into his hands with his eternal perspective or we don't but when you put your life in the in the hands of a god who knows the end from the beginning then you can let go of all fear you can let go of all worry you can let go of all stress because it's already played out in the mind of god one of the most cringing moments one of the most nail-biting moments you can have is your what yours for your favorite you know take a carnal example your favorite uh uh golfer your favorite uh race car driver your favorite football player favorite team and and you and and you you emotionally invest yourself in something that you can't control at all but we we get so invested in this and you know it's that those moments you those moments when you're so nervous you don't know who's going to win you're going to watch the you know the the the world series you don't know who's going to win so you're in anticipation what's going to happen i don't know it and you know what starts to happen anxiety i've watched certain people they can't even be in the same room they walk out of the room i'll find out what happens after it happens they don't want to experience it because what if they lose and so they get fearful and they get worried and they get there's excitement there's an anxiousness and and for some it just becomes a miserable experience because you just it's almost like ah i'm gonna i'll enjoy this after it's over and i find out they win then i'll celebrate but you know what's amazing if you ever if you ever go back and watch a rerun of your team that already won you don't sit there and worry you watched the third down you know third and and long and they fumbled the ball and the other team scores and man you don't sit there and throw anything you don't get mad you don't get upset you know why because you know fourth quarter's coming and in the fourth quarter he threw a touchdown and they kicked an old side's kick and you already know the entire you you follow me when you watch the recording there's no worry there's no fear because it's already happened and guess what your team already won and my brother my sister we shouldn't get so trapped up in time where we look at life with such anxiety and such worry we don't want to look at anything look at the back of the book you already won you can live this life with no pressure no fear no anxiety it's already been pre-recorded in the mind of god and you're a winner and you win and your children win and your family wins hallelujah it's already settled in the mind of god there's no reason to fear because it's already taken place in god's perspective from eternity it's already taken place he has made listen to this in ecclesiastes 3 11. he has made everything beautiful in his time he has made everything beautiful in his time he has also set eternity in the human heart yet no one can fathom no i want to read this from the king james he has made everything beautiful in his time he has also set the world in their heart in other words he's already given the the the cosmos he's given all humanity this concept of eternity so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end so man it's a it's a it was from this eternal perspective that the the that god comes from and so we say who are we really we we look at this you know this place that adam dwell where there was no fear there was no worry he he he lived in in perfection no anxiety no stress but the reason is is that there is a there's there's a but but for us as i was coming back to my train of thought there but for us brother branham says but you bypassed your theophany and he says you came into the world to be tested and tried you follow me you came into this world to be tested and tried and then you go back to your theophany that's why he says you you heard the word of god you recognized it as eagle's food you left the other thing you heard from your theophany you've already been translated and trans you've already been transfigured into the image of his dear son but but but your life is all about a struggle it's all about the struggle paul speaks of it in the book of romans because we don't come from eternity we're going to eternity we don't start like adam started we start with the curse we start with the fall and it's and even trying to understand this it's amazing to me because you you if you think of this as a as a human as a believer as a son or daughter of god you live with two opposing minds the bible teaches this the mind of the spirit and the carnal mind and the bible says the carnal mind what is the carnal mind that's your mind that you have right now as a believer right now you have a carnal mind and it wars against the mind of the spirit that's what paul said in colossians it wars against the mind of the spirit so the bible says the carnal mind is enmity with god it says and it can't even know the things of god but paul paul begins to describe this we know the scripture very well in romans uh he says this in romans 7 brother travis can you pull that up romans 7 verse 14. very familiar uh scripture paul says for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin slave he's speaking of slavery that's you today right now you're a slave to this and he says i'm carnal a a a sold under sin verse 15 keep just keep going for that which i do i allow not for what i would notice this for what i would amen that do i not but what i hate that do i verse 16. he says if then i do that which i don't want to do i would not i consent unto the law that it is good verse 17. now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh now he's going to why do you think paul makes a distinction there follow why does paul have to make a distinction and say now be careful because i'm speaking of something for i know that in me that is in my flesh in other words there's two me's and i'm gonna distinct i'm gonna i'm gonna identify to make sure you understand what i'm speaking of here that is this other me the one that that that doesn't do what the spirit wants me to do amen for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is he says for if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the here's the other me here's the go back here's the other me you've got a me in the flesh and he says for i delight in the law of god after the inward man are you following this but i see another law in my members there's the other man warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death and he has a real simple answer jesus christ amen real simple answer jesus christ but you know what it's not that simple it's a revelation amen who's going to deliver me from this war jesus christ i want to read you this from a from a phillips translation he says my own behavior baffles me for i find myself doing what i really loathe but not doing what i really want to do i often find that i have the will to do good but not the power when i want to do good only evil is within my reach it makes me a prisoner to the law of sin which is inherent in my mortal body amen for left to myself i serve the law of god with my mind but in my unspiritual nature i serve the law of sin it is an agonizing situation who can set me free from the prison of this mortal body only christ only christ so what is he describing here he's describing the way that you're made is very different than how you read about adam it's very different now you're by your you have two opposing there's two distinct what you find here romans there's two distinct separate lifes are forces two separate instincts two separate influences that is at work all the time in you all the time the quicker you understand this and you recognize this and you admit this the faster you'll get victory amen but people who don't see the side of themselves have a blind side to it that's right are you are you following me so there's two life forces and both of those forces both of those instincts both of those influences that that good and that evil that spiritual that carnal are constantly this warring of the that paul speaks of this war in the flesh that i have a part of me that wants to do the will of god then i have a part of me that doesn't and doesn't i find that i don't do it i found a law within me there's no good thing inside of me that is in my flesh so there's two distinct forces always trying to control you trying to control your thoughts trying to control your mind trying to control your spirit trying to control as who brother matt the world know i'm speaking to believers here tonight trying to control us or influence us i read this is amazing about the the just this little snippet from a book that i found and have been going through and he begins to to talk about this this force that he found and inside of him as a christian he says there are things about myself that scare me things like a great inner need that can't be explained like the constant need for love and fulfillment he goes on in this book begins to say that he had this as just a even as a young man as a teenage boy and he felt that always needs and and and always there's always a need for love and fulfillment remember brother branham said that that was natural and he preaches the message thirst and he says but he says god god gave you a holy thirst to thirst after him but satan will give you a substitute amen amen and he says he'll try to satisfy that holy thirst and he'll give you a perversion he says like a constant need for love and fulfillment also those subtle desires that surface on occasion making me lust for experiences that are contrary to my christian nature i can't explain why i am such a dual person when it comes to right and wrong the evil that i hate is always present in me the good and moral desires are there too keeping my mind in constant turmoil it is and he goes on to say he says just when i think i've got my act together things fall apart and once again i am doing things i really don't want to do now we're not talking about habitual habits here but as a as a christian as sons and daughters of god how we can relate to this can you relate a constant turmoil and he says right when i think i have my act together then i find myself things fall apart and i find i'm doing things that i really don't want to do the real me this war between good and evil is raging in all mankind a minister who was exposed for adultery this was a minister who was very very well known renowned man uh tv vandalist he was exposed for adultery and this was his confession it's a it's a direct quote from this man he says my evil nature held a strange charm over me it made me chase false dreams that i knew would fade away it kept me chained to a lust that finally destroyed me it forced me into compromises that weakened me its promise of true love ended up as only a mirage and even though i knew i would keep on getting hurt i followed the dictates of my evil mind like an obedient slave this was a preacher who was exposed and he begins to confess to that he gave himself over to he gave he allowed what did brother adam teach on when he taught about the white dog and the black dog in the natures and he says you know chief which one wins he said whichever one i feed the most which one i feed the most that's the one that wins paul paul says here he says who shall deliver me out of the body of this death but i thank god through jesus christ so what is it it's a it's a constant battle it's a constant war it's a struggle even though even the groanings that the bible speaks of in romans chapter 8 notice romans 8 verse 22 and he says for we know that the whole creation groaneth and traveleth in pain together until now is speaking of the earth because the earth is a part of god it's a part of it's an eternal attribute of god and he says what is the earth doing it's groaning it's travailing you know what that word groaning is the greek word stinzaio if i'm pronouncing that right it means to groan when you read this word here for we know that the whole creation groaneth and traveleth in pain together until now in other words it's still groaning you say brother matt when did it start groaning when adam was there in the garden in perfection no it wasn't groaning then it had a man to keep it it had a man to tend to it the earth wasn't under a curse it didn't bring forth thorns and thistles but after the fall a curse is put upon it and now there's pain another suffering now there's a struggle now there's torment now there's by the sweat of your brow now there's thorns and thistles that's what the curse was upon the earth it will bring forth it will yield unto you thorns and thistles you've got to labor you've got to teal you've got to you've got to you've got a toil and then paul says all creation all the earth is groaning and travailing in pain together brother brandon preached when he preached birth pains and he says what do you then he preaches the oncoming storm and he's talking about a hurricane that comes up from the south of florida and that hurricane it was just about to level florida and brother brandon begins to preach about that hurricane he says what is it he says it's a sign of judgment it's the language that the world the only language the world understands it's a language of judgment because god's trying to get its attention because the only thing left after you've spurned mercy is judgment and he says he says but what was it it was birth pains it's the world shaking and groaning and travail within itself wondering what perfection wanting what no more toil no more struggle no more sweat no more thorns and thistles what are you groaning for here tonight no more toil no more no i'm not talking about natural labor i'm talking about that struggle that warfare that the apostle paul described amen for we know that the whole creation grown and thrilleth in pain together until now verse 23 and not only they but ourselves also can you identify tonight which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body amen you know why because the redemption of this body means no more cancer no more covet no more no more no more depression no more anxiety no more fear no more doubt no more worry no more struggle no more giving into the devil's lies no more hatred no more malice no more envy no more strife when the body's rid you say where does all that come from i'm a believer i'm a christian i love the lord but yet i still struggle and i can get mad i can get angry what are you doing you're groaning and travelling saying i'm ready to be rid of this carnal man i'm ready for the real me to come through i'm ready for my character to match the character of this and he says for we groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body that word groaning stenzio means to groan because of pressure being exerted forward like the pressure of childbirth to feel pressure from what is coming on to groan decide deeply to to to make to be in straits to sigh and and so he says we murmur we groan within ourselves because you say why because we have the holy ghost that's why amen because we have an earnest because we have a deposit of eternal life because we've tasted of eden because we've tasted of perfection because we've tasted of holiness we desire holiness because we've tasted of god we want more of god because we've tasted of where we came from of who we really are of who we really are can you say amen i want to i want to just read this here brother brandon begins to talk about this make sure i'm i'm in my right place here before i just begin reading yes the sumerian church age he says now comes our triumphal capstone on the baptism of the holy ghost galatians 4 4-7 but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son than an heir of god through christ that's galatians 4 of verse 7 brother travis he says you're you're an heir then an heir through wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son than an heir of god through christ notice what brother branham says here he says there it is jesus christ came forth died upon the cross and accomplished redemption which means to restore to the original owner by means of purchase or paying the price so what was he doing at calvary he was purchasing he was restoring back to the owner by purchasing can you say amen and he says he says and he says there it is jesus christ comes forth dies upon the cross and thereby by what by that by that perfect work by that finished work placed us as sons now listen close he did not make us sons amen he did not make us sons for we were already his sons but he placed us as his sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as his son why because you were like an orphan an orphan is is is a son already by someone but he's been orphaned so brother branham says you were a son i want you to notice i wanna i want you just to notice what brother branham says here he says we were held captive by the devil but we were sons nonetheless we were held captive you say when in sin amen so what does the baptism of the holy ghost do for you does it make you a son or daughter of god no you always were it only adopts you into the family and recognizes you as a son but you always were a son amen he says we were held captive by the devil but we were sons nonetheless and hear this because you are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts whereby you cry abba father father upon whom he asked this question upon whom did the spirit fall at pentecost sons amen amen upon sons who at corinth sons when they heard the word of god the holy ghost baptized them and he says sons while they heard the word of god what is the baptism with the holy ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of christ it is the new birth it is the spirit of god coming in and filling you after you have repented and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience towards god what we have just set forth would be much easier for all to understand if all believe the doctrine of the oneness of the godhead for there are not three persons in that godhead but one thus we are not born again by the spirit of life of jesus coming in and then subsequent to that the holy spirit coming in to give us power he goes on to say this he says thus it is the the father son and holy ghost all coming in at one time for it is one person comprising that godhead i wish i had this on the screen that advent took place at pentecost what was it sons already sons not made sons so the real you notice what brother branham says here i'm going to close on this if you have that powerpoint that i i sent just display that i want i want to read you this was so good i just read this afternoon along the lines of what we just read brother branham saying in sumerian church age here brother bannon begins to describe this and i think i have good he says the first book of life coming up was he says the first book of life coming up was when you were born that was your natural birth see but then one time way back down and there there was a little grain of life as i was explaining to some of the young sisters at the house this afternoon see there's a little grain of life laying there that you wonder where did it come from what these strange things i was saying this talk taking for myself like you was going to say william branham well 40 years ago the william branham and he says it isn't the same one tonight 40 years ago william branham is not the same one tonight see he says if someone back there would say william branham was a rank rascal see because i was born of charles and elle branham in their nature i was a sinner i came to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me amen what were you are you any different than him no was i any different than him no your children today if they're not born and filled with the holy ghost they're no different than he was they have the nature of their father and mother a sinful the curse of sin is passed down generation a generation and he says all the sins notice he says he says in the nature i was a sinner i came to the word a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature present see predestinated was in there by god in this same body two natures in there listen well i only catered to one as it growed i gued as a baby dada first thing you know i became a liar you don't want to believe that about your children but there's brother branham saying hey they're gooning gaga and as a baby but then they become a liar that's just your children that's who they are the bible says foolishness is locked up inside of them bound they're bound with it he says then i i became a liar and he says first thing you know become a liar become everything else that's a sinner because i was raised up that way but down in there he keeps going back to this but down in there he says it was a little speck of life all the time i used to remember as a little boy hoping not holding too long he said sitting out there on the creek bank and i'd sit there and look around at night time pop and mom they're going on now to the rest them days they were sinners there was no christianity in our home at all and oh my drinking and parties and carrying on it made me sick i'd take my lantern and my dog and go to the woods to stay all night in the winter time i'd hunt till the party was over maybe daylight in the morning come home wouldn't be over i've laid on the top of a shed and slept waiting for daylight to break then i think of how that time he says then i'd i think of how the times then being out there in the summertime get my sticks and put them down for a little wind break where if it had rained lay there and have the poles sticking in the water fishing my old dog laying there i'd say look at here you know last winter i he says looky here you know last winter i camped right here one night i built a fire right here when i was waiting for my old dog here to tree and i had a fire here it was froze five inches deep in the ground but little flower where'd you come from see well i love brother brandon the way he illustrates this he starts pointing to his life and he says he says there was my first book of life he said i was just a sinner he says just came from my parents the center that was part of my nature i was going and gagging as a baby then i became a liar and i just be you know all the sins of us that a sinner would do and he says and you know i remember his land as a little boy and he said mom and dad would drink and party all night and come home and he says i remember you know one winter i had laid there and made my little campfire and he says and i laid there all night and he says and right there i was waiting for my dog to tree and out of fire it was froze five inches deep in the ground but little flower where'd you come from see well where'd you come from who come out here and planted you and what hot house did they bring you out of or what about it where'd you come from see that little flower i'd say why it was froze and everything and i built a fire on top of here besides the freezing element there was a heat element laying in here on a big old log where i burned you and yet here you are wow yeah there you go and you're alive notice what brother madam uses in nature he says it was impossible i came from a mom and dad drinking and there was no christianity in my home and laying out there in the woods he said and he said there was the it was the the ground was frozen five inches thick and then i'd build a fire and he says then i looked and a little flower where'd you come from how did you make it who brought you out here i burned you and yet here you are and you're alive where'd you come from what was it there was another william branham a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of god the word of god that was placed in there not by his mother not by his father not by his good house or a bad house or good raising or bad raising but by god before the foundation of the world and it came through the fire it came through the winter and it survived amen the word of god is placed in there each one of you can think of similar things see i love this it was working then look up to the trees and think leaf i seen you fall off last year why are you back there again where did you come from what brought you here see it was that eternal life working in the body now then one day as i walked on that voice talking don't ever smoke drink so forth and the young fellas and all got older see there was something moving but yet all at once i looked up and i said i'm not the son of charles and ella branham there's something calling like my little eagle i'm not a chicken there's something up yonder somewhere oh great jehovah whoever you are open up i want to come home there's something in me calling then i was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow now that old life was forgiven put in the sea of god's forgiveness never to be remembered against me no more see now we stand justified as though we never had sin in the presence of god what is it it's that seed gene of god down on the inside of the inside brother sister who are you really who are you really you're that see gene zoe life down inside of you and it didn't matter how much fire it didn't matter how much water didn't matter his raisin a good home a bad home good conduct bad conduct the life of god was placed down inside of there and when he began to cry out to god god responded and he was born again by the spirit of god who are you really uh you say i'm a sinner saved by grace that's right but i'm a son from my father in the back part of god's mind [Music] and uh and you say brother matt how who are we who are we today we're nothing outside of the grace that god has shed upon our shed abroad in our lives or nothing but that you say little flower where'd you come from how did i make it you know you could say that about your life here today how did how did i make it here where did this co you look at your life and here you are in church you love the lord you're here saying amen to the word of god where'd you come from say that to yourself little life where'd that come from i didn't put it there i didn't put that desire there i it wasn't anything that i did but god who was rich in mercy all i did was reach out and say help me god i want to come up i want to go home lord and then god heard my voice let's all stand to our feet here tonight musicians could you come hey man i love that so much that's all bearer heads here together amen you could play something softly lord we're so grateful lord as we read this father we so identify with it lord as sons and daughters of god as your prophet even lord looking back over his life and seeing the chaos that he came out of lord yet he looks and he says 30 40 years ago that william branham oh he was a rascal and he says but that's not the same william branham today it's a different person oh he was a rascal he was a sinner and he and he came from a wrecked home came from a family of alcoholics and came from chaos lord it didn't matter it began to see that little flower and it didn't matter lord it didn't matter that there was he had built a fire on the ground didn't matter that the earth was frozen five inches thick lord it didn't matter yet there it was couldn't explain it lord and we can't explain it in our own life just something softly if you could we couldn't explain it in our own life can't explain lord that that sieging of god that's down on the inside of us lord he couldn't
