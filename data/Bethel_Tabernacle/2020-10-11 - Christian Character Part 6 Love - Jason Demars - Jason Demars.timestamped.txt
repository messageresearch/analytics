[1:31] we bless you thank you for tuning in on
[1:34] on the stream and going to continue on
[1:37] our sunday school topic of christian
[1:40] character
[1:41] part six and we'll continue looking at
[1:45] love and what we're gonna do is we're
[1:47] gonna finish from last time what we were
[1:49] talking about
[1:50] agape love and then we're gonna go into
[1:53] filio love
[1:55] so with that said we're going to start
[1:57] with first corinthians chapter 13
[2:00] verse 4. i'll just read the first verse
[2:03] and then
[2:04] then we'll pray love is patient i'm
[2:07] reading from the
[2:08] english standard version of course the
[2:10] king james is a
[2:11] is the best version preferred version
[2:13] but sometimes it's a little
[2:15] uh wordy and difficult to understand and
[2:18] so in some instances i'll use the esv
[2:21] just
[2:22] to help us get a bigger picture of of
[2:24] what's being said love is patient
[2:26] and kind love does not envy or boast
[2:30] it is not arrogant amen let's pray
[2:33] heavenly father
[2:35] you're the god of all grace and you see
[2:39] us in this word and you see us and you
[2:42] see
[2:44] on one hand you see it as perfect
[2:47] as sinless not because of ourselves but
[2:49] because of the blood of jesus christ
[2:52] on the other hand you see that we need
[2:54] to grow and
[2:56] that i need to grow and there's there's
[2:58] ways that we
[3:00] still fall short of your perfect word
[3:02] lord but you're
[3:04] molding us and you're shaping us into
[3:06] the image of jesus christ and we ask
[3:08] that you would just continue to do that
[3:10] help us to be humble and help us to
[3:14] abound
[3:15] more and more in your love and in your
[3:17] grace
[3:18] we ask this in the name of jesus christ
[3:20] amen
[3:22] amen so like i said i was reading from
[3:25] the esv
[3:27] and we started out love is patient
[3:31] and kind
[3:34] love is patient you know that's
[3:36] sometimes that's our
[3:38] our biggest problem is we we do love
[3:41] and yet we get angry we get
[3:45] upset quickly and patience
[3:49] endures or love i should say
[3:53] endures all things it says in another
[3:56] place so it endures all sorts of
[3:57] hardships
[3:59] sufferings persecutions when people are
[4:02] purposely
[4:03] seeking to make you angry love
[4:06] is patient when the devil is attacking
[4:09] you
[4:11] from the left from the right it
[4:13] patiently endures
[4:15] that which god has god's providence has
[4:18] plotted out for your life
[4:22] love is kind that speaks of
[4:27] being tender and compassionate again
[4:29] this is agape love
[4:31] that's why in the king james version you
[4:34] see it's using the word charity it's
[4:35] trying to distinct
[4:36] distinguish itself from
[4:40] brotherly love so
[4:43] this love is kind it's compassionate
[4:47] it's tender it's kind even when others
[4:50] are rude
[4:52] it's kind when people don't deserve
[4:56] kindness you know if you look at the
[5:00] word
[5:00] um agape in the there's a kind of an
[5:04] expanded
[5:05] strong's concordance that goes into more
[5:07] detail about the different um
[5:10] greek words this it says agape is wider
[5:14] embracing especially the judgment and
[5:17] the deliberate
[5:18] ascent of the will as a matter of
[5:20] principle
[5:21] duty and propriety agape goes beyond
[5:26] feelings it goes beyond how we feel
[5:29] towards a person
[5:30] and says the word of god commands me to
[5:33] be kind
[5:34] to be patient to not be arrogant to not
[5:37] be rude
[5:40] and so i'm going to rise above my
[5:42] feelings at whatever moment this is
[5:44] and i'm going to do what is right in
[5:47] this circumstance
[5:50] let feelings follow that but it's an act
[5:53] of the will and it's looking at what is
[5:55] scripturally and morally in line
[5:58] with the character of god that's what
[6:01] agape love is looking at
[6:02] it's not looking at whether they deserve
[6:04] it you know when we didn't deserve it
[6:06] christ died for us when
[6:10] people oh all of us
[6:14] the bible says that the day you eat
[6:17] thereof that day you die
[6:20] sin sin is worthy of death so the
[6:23] the very moment that we sin we're worthy
[6:26] of death we live we even take our next
[6:30] breath
[6:31] that we breathe by god's grace
[6:35] and so we understand that he gives us
[6:38] good gifts
[6:39] even when we don't deserve it he
[6:41] supplies the needs of
[6:43] of people that hate and despise him
[6:46] god does it and he commands us to do the
[6:48] same
[6:49] thing love does not envy
[6:53] it it doesn't envy people when they're
[6:56] blessed
[6:57] with something materially or spiritually
[7:01] or the lord puts them in a different
[7:03] position
[7:05] maybe one that you think you deserve it
[7:07] doesn't go into a place of envy
[7:11] it rejoices with that person for the
[7:14] blessing that they receive
[7:17] it doesn't boast
[7:21] love understands love that's in our
[7:23] heart understands
[7:25] everything that we have is given
[7:28] from our heavenly father
[7:31] in whom is no variance it comes down
[7:33] from the father of lights to us as a
[7:35] blessing
[7:36] from him and when those blessings are
[7:40] removed and we face
[7:41] difficulty upon difficulty we understand
[7:44] that god has
[7:45] by his sovereign will plotted that out
[7:49] for us
[7:50] and says okay i can accept this
[7:54] i can i can deal with this it it
[7:58] it understands there's no reason to
[8:01] boast
[8:03] it's not arrogant love doesn't
[8:06] get in love of god in our heart doesn't
[8:09] get inflated
[8:10] with our own importance
[8:14] it stays humble it doesn't think less of
[8:17] we don't being humble isn't thinking
[8:20] less of ourselves
[8:21] it's thinking less about ourselves and
[8:23] more about others
[8:26] and so you know we we've whatever we've
[8:29] received it's been by
[8:31] the grace and purpose of god and
[8:35] as job said the lord gives and the lord
[8:38] takes away blessed be the name of the
[8:39] lord
[8:40] and so it's in his sovereign hand to do
[8:42] with us as we will
[8:44] so if we start boasting god can take it
[8:47] right away from us
[8:49] so we just have to know that we're
[8:50] relying on him and everything
[8:52] it's not arrogant or verse 5
[8:56] says rude in the esv
[9:00] so where it says doth not behave itself
[9:02] unseemly it's speaking of being
[9:06] rude so
[9:09] love is not rude my
[9:14] let's not point our fingers out at other
[9:16] people you know this is
[9:17] this is a good word i'm going to shovel
[9:19] that towards this one and i'm going to
[9:20] shovel that towards charles and i'm
[9:22] going to shovel that towards luther
[9:24] look inside look i'm looking inside of
[9:25] myself
[9:27] we all have a desperate need for god's
[9:31] mercy when we look at this
[9:33] verse and we all frankly fall short
[9:37] of loving in this way but
[9:40] by god's grace he's working with us and
[9:43] teaching us brother branham says
[9:45] in the bride there'll be perfect love
[9:48] we'll have
[9:49] here what they have over there
[9:52] when we get as we get closer and closer
[9:54] to the rapture
[9:56] so god's grace is sufficient in those
[9:59] things it's not rude
[10:01] in other words it it behaves with
[10:03] respect
[10:04] towards others it values others above
[10:07] itself
[10:08] the bible says in honor prefer
[10:12] one another it puts other people above
[10:15] say that person is more important than
[10:16] me
[10:17] not less important more important so so
[10:20] obviously you're not going to treat them
[10:21] with rudeness
[10:22] when you you view people that way
[10:26] seeketh not her own it says in the esv
[10:29] it does not
[10:29] insist on its own
[10:33] way wow love wants to ensure the
[10:37] salvation and the blessing of
[10:38] others paul says multiple times and in
[10:41] multiple different ways
[10:43] i was willing to give my own
[10:46] soul for you i was really to sacrifice
[10:50] my own self so that they could be saved
[10:52] now that is love
[10:55] that is love
[10:58] love is not uh easily provoked or
[11:01] love is not irritable
[11:05] it's not easily angered it's not looking
[11:08] for a fight
[11:10] in every circumstance it's not looking
[11:12] to establish
[11:14] itself it's looking for the
[11:16] establishment and the betterment
[11:19] of the other person love is not
[11:21] resentful
[11:23] or where it says thinks no
[11:26] evil that means that love does not
[11:30] assume
[11:30] the worst about a person it encounters
[11:35] we find that in some people we meet and
[11:37] sometimes in our own selves
[11:39] we see actions we see behaviors and we
[11:43] assume
[11:43] ab the absolute worst about them
[11:47] that's not what love does love hears
[11:50] something the person did oh they didn't
[11:52] mean it that way
[11:53] didn't brother branham say that that's
[11:55] absolutely scriptural
[11:58] thinks no evil it doesn't think evil
[12:00] about another person it says
[12:02] oh they didn't mean to do that that was
[12:04] just that was the devil
[12:06] trying to cause a stir i forgive him i
[12:08] lay it aside forget about it brother
[12:10] branham
[12:11] time and time again when the minister
[12:14] ministers that invited him or didn't
[12:15] invite him
[12:16] treated him so bad and people said
[12:19] people tried to even provoke brother
[12:21] branham
[12:22] against those people and he said no i
[12:25] i wouldn't want to do that to them
[12:26] because i wouldn't want anybody to do
[12:28] that to me
[12:30] and so that's love verse
[12:33] six it love it it
[12:36] does not rejoice at wrongdoing but
[12:39] rejoices
[12:41] with the truth love does not rejoice
[12:43] when something bad
[12:45] happens to another person or when a
[12:47] person sins or falls
[12:49] yep see i knew that they i knew that
[12:51] they were going to find i didn't have a
[12:52] good feeling about that person who's
[12:55] we've we've all thought it if we haven't
[12:58] if we haven't even said it out loud i
[12:59] knew that i knew that person was going
[13:01] to do
[13:01] no it's it grieves it should grieve our
[13:04] hearts
[13:04] if we have the love of god it should
[13:06] grieve us
[13:07] it should cause cause us to pray
[13:11] you know the bible says let everyone
[13:12] that stands take heed lest he fall
[13:15] so you see someone else fall it
[13:16] shouldn't be like i knew that was going
[13:17] to happen
[13:19] no it should be oh god by your grace
[13:23] don't let me don't let me fall
[13:26] let me stand on the truth i have nothing
[13:29] but you
[13:30] and lord my may my heart go out to that
[13:32] person
[13:33] in mercy and in love reaching out
[13:37] brother branham says
[13:38] you know there's that i believe
[13:42] the quote goes something like this he's
[13:44] talking to a young man
[13:45] and talking about a person that went
[13:48] astray
[13:49] and um let that rascal go
[13:53] the young man minister said to brother
[13:54] branham so brother abraham says oh my
[13:58] if my heart doesn't go out after that
[14:01] person
[14:02] then i'm the one that belongs here at
[14:04] the altar
[14:06] he said and i did and i went out after
[14:08] them and i brought them back
[14:10] by god's grace that's
[14:14] the heart of love but rejoices with
[14:17] the truth we don't rejuv we don't
[14:19] rejoice when a person sins
[14:23] it doesn't make us happy we rejoice
[14:26] when they l walk in the truth didn't
[14:28] john say that
[14:29] little chill little children
[14:33] i have i my my my joy is that you walk
[14:37] in the truth so that's our that's our
[14:40] joy
[14:41] if we have the love of god in our heart
[14:43] it's rejoicing when they walk in the
[14:45] truth
[14:45] if they walk in sin it grieves us
[14:49] it shouldn't anger us or drive us to
[14:51] hatred
[14:52] it should drive us to our knees to pray
[14:54] for them pray for them
[14:57] verse 7 love bears all things
[15:02] believes all things hopes all things
[15:05] endures all things the word
[15:09] bears there in the greek
[15:13] means to conceal or contain
[15:17] this reminds me of first peter 4
[15:21] verse 8. he says above all keeping keep
[15:24] loving one another earnestly
[15:26] since love covers a multitude
[15:30] of sins so what does that mean
[15:35] to cover a multitude
[15:38] of sins aren't we supposed to expose sin
[15:41] aren't we supposed to preach against sin
[15:43] absolutely
[15:45] in general but when it comes to
[15:47] individuals
[15:49] we we're supposed to cover that what is
[15:52] what does that mean to cover it
[15:54] love doesn't gossip and expose all the
[15:56] wrongdoings of others
[15:58] love goes directly to the person
[16:00] involved
[16:01] and speaks directly to that person
[16:05] that isn't that what the bible says to
[16:06] do and i think it's matthew 17
[16:09] jesus speaks about that he doesn't say
[16:11] if your brother sins go tell your pastor
[16:13] about it
[16:15] if your brother sins against you you
[16:18] go to your brother and be reconciled to
[16:21] him
[16:22] if he doesn't receive it take another
[16:24] person a witness
[16:26] another person that you trust bring them
[16:28] to them if they don't receive it
[16:29] tell it before the church and then cast
[16:32] them out
[16:32] it should solve it for the first time if
[16:35] you go to them
[16:36] with love with compassion with
[16:40] tenderness
[16:41] with a desire for reconciliation love
[16:44] bears
[16:45] all things love believes all things
[16:49] it's a strange thing to say believes all
[16:52] things what does that mean
[16:54] it doesn't believe lies
[16:58] because it doesn't rejoice in wrong
[17:00] doing it rejoices in the truth
[17:03] believes all things it believes the best
[17:05] about a person
[17:08] it doesn't believe the worst it it
[17:11] believe it believes for
[17:13] the best for every person involved
[17:17] that doesn't mean we experience the best
[17:20] from them but it still believes
[17:22] god can do the best in them and
[17:26] for that person and not not only that
[17:29] but it believes
[17:30] all the promises of god it stands with
[17:32] all the promises of god
[17:34] and it also hopes
[17:37] all things when the person has done
[17:41] the worst thing in their life
[17:44] when it looks to us they've sinned away
[17:47] their day of grace
[17:49] love says i still have hope in your
[17:52] restoration
[17:53] i still have hope in your transformation
[17:56] if god can save the apostle paul
[18:00] he can save anyone
[18:04] because the fact is he was literally
[18:06] trying to
[18:07] kill and destroy the move of god
[18:11] through the christians he was he and he
[18:14] did kill
[18:14] kill them and he did arrest them and he
[18:16] was on his way to do
[18:18] even more and to increase increase and
[18:20] more and more in
[18:21] in this in this thing and god met him
[18:26] when he had no desire for him paul
[18:29] wasn't seeking
[18:30] after god he was seeking after the god
[18:32] of his
[18:33] imagi sinful heart and imagination
[18:36] according to the law
[18:38] not the true and living god he wasn't
[18:40] looking for jesus but
[18:42] jesus came looking for that rank
[18:45] filthy blasphemous sinner
[18:49] so love hopes all things if we can if
[18:52] if the apostle paul was saved we can
[18:55] hold
[18:56] hope and belief and faith
[18:59] for people who are seemingly sinning
[19:02] away
[19:03] their day of grace love endures all
[19:06] things
[19:07] every trial every tribulation everything
[19:09] in this life
[19:11] every nasty thing a person says to you
[19:13] love
[19:14] endures it now that is
[19:18] god in you because
[19:21] we've all experienced resistance we've
[19:25] all spir
[19:25] experienced people frustrating us and
[19:28] hurting us we've all experienced
[19:30] being in churches where we feel like we
[19:33] were damaged
[19:34] we feel like we were hurt we feel like
[19:38] our faith was almost destroyed
[19:42] love endures all things and so
[19:46] if we have the love of god in our hearts
[19:49] we will go through those things and say
[19:51] i'll take this hit
[19:53] in order to serve god and serve other
[19:56] people
[19:57] you know if you start to serve god and
[20:00] i'm not saying
[20:01] talking about preaching i'm talking
[20:03] about love
[20:04] if you start to serve god in this way
[20:07] people are going to misunderstand people
[20:09] are going to get upset
[20:11] people are going to get frustrated with
[20:13] you think people are going to think
[20:14] evil of you and speak evil of you and
[20:17] guess what
[20:19] love endures all things don't don't
[20:22] it it will discourage you of course
[20:24] because you're human but don't let that
[20:26] prevail
[20:27] don't let that stop you from serving god
[20:31] he wants to use you so endure all things
[20:35] we when you love people you expose
[20:38] yourself to being hurt
[20:40] right you expose yourself to being hurt
[20:45] and the bible has all the answers for
[20:48] all of these things
[20:48] love endures all that love believes all
[20:53] the best about people love hopes for the
[20:56] best
[20:56] in people and for people love
[21:00] bears all things it it it goes through
[21:03] all things and it covers
[21:04] all things second corinthians 12
[21:10] 15
[21:13] the apostle paul writes to the
[21:14] corinthians and i love this
[21:16] and i will very gladly spend
[21:19] and be spent for you
[21:25] that's a beautiful thing he says i'm
[21:27] going to i'm going to
[21:30] give my whole strength my whole ability
[21:33] all my possessions he's willing to do
[21:36] anything
[21:38] that he could for their spiritual growth
[21:41] and their blessing he's willing to do
[21:44] that
[21:46] and but notice what he says next
[21:49] though the more abundantly ii
[21:53] corinthians
[21:54] 12 15 though the more abundantly i love
[21:58] you the less
[21:58] i be loved aren't you
[22:02] if somebody's willing to give their
[22:03] whole self for your spiritual blessing
[22:06] and upliftment wouldn't you think that
[22:08] people would love
[22:09] that person more well it isn't always
[22:12] the case
[22:13] it isn't always what happens many times
[22:17] that's interpreted
[22:18] differently by people and paul says
[22:24] it doesn't matter what you do to me does
[22:26] not
[22:27] affect my love for you
[22:31] and though i love you more and more and
[22:33] more and you love me less and less
[22:36] i still am very glad to spend and be
[22:39] spent
[22:40] for you that's love
[22:45] galatians chapter 5
[22:48] verse 13 through 15.
[22:58] for brethren you have been called unto
[23:00] liberty
[23:02] only use not liberty for an occasion to
[23:05] the flesh
[23:06] look at this but by love
[23:10] serve one another
[23:14] so you've been called to liberty what
[23:17] are we gonna use your liberty for
[23:22] you've been called to be you're free
[23:24] from the law of sin
[23:26] and death by the the death
[23:30] of jesus christ through his blood you're

[24:41] it's not i.t it's not working for the
[24:45] for the county
[24:49] it's not preaching my occupation in life
[24:53] is by love to serve one another
[24:57] that's the main goal that you and i
[25:00] should have young people do you want to
[25:02] have an aspiration in life do you want

[25:19] i'm going to live by love serve one
[25:21] another i want to manifest jesus christ

[25:25] the measure of the stature
[25:27] of the fullness of christ what does that
[25:29] look like
[25:30] by love serve one another amen
[25:34] get yourself out of the way get your
[25:36] needs your desires out of the way and
[25:38] say
[25:38] how can i reach out how can i be a
[25:40] blessing
[25:41] open your eyes to what's going on around
[25:43] you
[25:45] god will use you but if you're if you
[25:47] just have your blinders on
[25:49] i see my life see what's going on in
[25:52] front of me
[25:53] i don't see anybody else there's no one
[25:55] here you know i make it really narrow
[25:57] i can't see luther i can't see charles i
[26:00] can't see
[26:01] brother here i can't see anybody but i
[26:04] love
[26:05] i love people take the blinders off
[26:08] see what's going on around you sometimes
[26:10] that's our biggest problem as christians
[26:12] is we're so
[26:13] focused and as young people we're so
[26:16] focused on ourself
[26:18] we're so focused on what can i do and
[26:20] you wanna be loving and you wanna do
[26:23] do right and you want to do good but
[26:25] you're narrow
[26:26] when your focus is so narrow on yourself
[26:30] and those people immediately around you
[26:33] and phones are not good for that either
[26:36] we have our eyes so much down in
[26:38] internet social media news
[26:40] of the world that it just puts us in
[26:43] shackles
[26:44] we weren't called to be in shackles
[26:46] we're called to be free
[26:48] and being free god sees everything right
[26:52] and if you're in touch and in fellowship
[26:55] with god
[26:56] god can speak to you about anything
[27:00] any need that's why we need gifts in the
[27:02] body of christ and gifts is not
[27:05] just merely standing on the platform and
[27:06] discerning something about
[27:08] sometimes god will let you know
[27:10] something private so you can pray about
[27:11] it or go to that person privately
[27:13] sometimes god will speak to you about
[27:15] doing such and such a thing for a person
[27:18] in a circumstance that they have in
[27:20] their life
[27:22] open your eyes get your vision of the
[27:25] uh up up to heaven and to those around
[27:28] you
[27:29] because there's lots of needs there's
[27:31] lots of people hurting
[27:32] there's lots of people that need a
[27:34] friend
[27:35] stop thinking about this
[27:39] this vision i have love i have love i
[27:42] have the love of christ
[27:43] yeah you do so use it
[27:47] you do i believe you do you're filled
[27:48] with the holy ghost
[27:50] so the holy ghost is in reaching out and
[27:53] that's something that we have to
[27:55] grow into verse 14 for all the law is
[27:58] fulfilled in one word
[28:00] even this thou shalt love thy neighbor
[28:03] as thyself so the law is
[28:07] fulfilled in that
[28:11] so we're under the new covenant we're
[28:13] still under the new covenant
[28:15] and that new covenant is not the ten
[28:18] commandments but it's
[28:19] the commandments written in our heart so
[28:23] if the law is to be written in our heart
[28:24] what's being written in our heart
[28:27] love if we're gonna reach the perfection
[28:30] of the new covenant
[28:32] okay what is the perfection of the new
[28:35] covenant today we're going to go on
[28:37] to perfection we're not going to lay the
[28:39] foundation what's the perfection of that
[28:42] brother branham it's perfect love
[28:45] perfect love so we need to have that
[28:48] perfect
[28:48] love towards our neighbor who's your
[28:50] neighbor everyone
[28:52] everywhere the whole planet so
[28:56] let's stand and and pray
[29:01] heavenly father we're thankful for your
[29:03] love for your mercy for your grace lord
[29:05] i pray that you would
[29:06] help us to increase more and more in
[29:08] this love
[29:09] may your agape love be in us lord
[29:15] reaching out and serving one another
[29:18] not because of something they they did
[29:20] or they deserved lord but
[29:22] because you called us to do it may
[29:26] the gifts of the spirit operate in our
[29:28] in our midst lord
[29:32] i'm not just speaking of supernatural
[29:34] gifts but
[29:35] those things which are just common
[29:39] sometimes ours becomes supernatural
[29:41] because there's
[29:42] they're infused with love give us all a
[29:45] vision of
[29:46] of of hearts and needs and help us to
[29:50] reach out to one another
[29:54] to by love serve one another lord we
[29:56] commit ourselves to you for your glory
[29:58] we ask that your spirit would be with us
[30:00] today
[30:01] that you would be in the midst of us as
[30:04] we worship and as the preaching of the
[30:06] word goes forth may you be glorified and
[30:08] lifted up
[30:09] we ask these things in jesus name amen
[30:12] amen god bless you
