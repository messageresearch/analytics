[0:00] our
[0:05] eyes we want to see
[0:14] Jesus to reach out and
[0:20] touch
[0:22] him to say that we
[0:28] love
[0:31] [Music]
[0:33] open
[0:35] [Music]
[0:40] our and help us
[0:48] to
[0:50] open our
[0:56] eyes we want to see
[1:04] you can be seated
[1:10] morning God bless you this morning good
[1:13] to be in God's house my kind of church
[1:16] we have food and and uh and service all
[1:19] rolled up into the same event that's all
[1:22] right well God bless you uh it is uh
[1:26] really neat to see all of you and I
[1:27] don't know all of your names so I
[1:29] thought if you don't mind we'd start
[1:31] this morning by everybody saying their
[1:32] name yes that'll be all right okay but
[1:35] we're kind of crimped on time so I
[1:37] thought why don't we just go ahead and
[1:39] do it together so on the count of three
[1:41] tell me your name 1 2
[1:44] 3 God bless
[1:46] you my name is Pastor Bob shumu and I'm
[1:49] glad to be here today and uh we're going
[1:52] to have to go fast all right if you have
[1:53] your Bible take it we're going to go to
[1:55] the Book of Joshua chapter 2 if you
[1:57] don't have your Bible everything is on
[1:58] the screen I'll leave this PowerPoint
[2:00] with you so uh you can go back and look
[2:03] at it again but we're going to kind of
[2:04] go fast I normally talk 150 words a
[2:06] minute but I'll probably Guss to 220
[2:08] today so stay with me and they're
[2:10] cleaning and so forth so uh just kind of
[2:13] bear with me uh I've talked at a lot of
[2:15] Youth Camps over my years I counted last
[2:17] night I was out as Andrew was preaching
[2:19] and it's been about a hundred years
[2:20] since I've been preaching Youth Camp so
[2:22] I probably spoke to most of your parents
[2:24] at some point in life and there's a
[2:27] couple of basic things that I think are
[2:29] good to talk about when it comes to
[2:31] meetings like this and uh they deserve
[2:33] more than what we're going to give it
[2:35] today but I'll give you some uh things
[2:37] maybe to think about all right so as we
[2:40] look in the Scripture it says uh in
[2:43] Joshua 2 10 therefore I pray you swear
[2:46] unto me this is Rahab and she's speaking
[2:48] to the two spies that have come she
[2:51] knows the city is going down she knows
[2:54] this this is not going to last and she's
[2:56] standing there in her house and she says
[2:59] I pray you swear unto me by the Lord
[3:01] since I have showed you kindness that
[3:04] you will also show kindness unto my
[3:05] father's house and give me a true token
[3:09] in other words she's saying I heard the
[3:11] exploits of your God and I know your
[3:13] God's going to roll through here and
[3:15] we're in the way and that's not a good
[3:17] place to be God is fulfilling his word
[3:19] he's bringing it to pass and Jericho
[3:21] stands right in the middle and they have
[3:22] an attitude and that's never a good
[3:24] place to be with God so I know this city
[3:27] is is the days of this city are numbered
[3:29] so you're saying that you have a token
[3:32] or uh a place where I can be that I'll
[3:35] I'll be exempt from the Judgment that's
[3:38] that's inevitable and she said give me
[3:40] that token but I want the real thing I
[3:43] don't want to make believe thing I want
[3:46] the real thing I want I want whatever it
[3:48] is that's going to help me to get
[3:50] through the Judgment here because I know
[3:53] it's an evitable we also believe that
[3:55] judgment is inevitable isn't that right
[3:57] and for me I don't know about you but
[3:59] but for me I want to have the real thing
[4:02] I don't want to come to the end of the
[4:03] road and I don't want to see judgment
[4:05] strike America in a fuller way and not
[4:08] have the real thing how many of you want
[4:09] to have the real thing I know all your
[4:12] names now so I saw those that didn't
[4:14] raise your hand but I I want to have the
[4:16] real thing I don't want to be climbing
[4:18] the ladder that's leaning against the
[4:20] wrong wall I want to be in the right
[4:22] place at the right time focused on the
[4:23] right things I want to have the right
[4:25] kind of faith and faith comes by hearing
[4:27] and hearing by the word and in order for
[4:29] your faith to be right you got to be
[4:30] hearing right and God sent us the right
[4:32] thing in order to believe right to get
[4:34] out of here before judgment strikes are
[4:36] we okay yes so brother bam said and uh
[4:41] in 1950 he said now uh by the way I'm
[4:44] probably not going to read all of these
[4:45] quotes what you'll have the PowerPoint
[4:46] if you want it brother Bam's talking
[4:48] about the day of Pentecost and Peter
[4:50] said it's for you and your children as
[4:51] many as the Lord Our God shall call and
[4:53] every person that enters into the
[4:55] baptism of the spirit can have the same
[4:58] kind said say that again every person
[5:00] that enters into the baptism of the Holy
[5:02] Spirit everybody believe in the baptism
[5:04] of the Holy Spirit you don't believe as
[5:06] much as I do I believe it's absolutely
[5:08] essential it is
[5:10] initial it is it is absolutely
[5:13] imperative that you have an encounter
[5:15] with God we're a people who like to
[5:17] Google everything and we like
[5:18] information in God's view an encounter
[5:22] is better than
[5:23] information is that all right an
[5:25] experience is better than
[5:27] knowledge so therefore brother random
[5:30] says every person that enters into the
[5:31] baptism of the Holy Spirit can have the
[5:33] same kind of holy ghost that they got on
[5:36] the day of
[5:38] Pentecost same kind brother brand didn't
[5:41] bring another Holy Ghost Paul didn't
[5:43] have a different version than brother BR
[5:45] as matter of fact brother Graham said
[5:46] the way Paul preached it that's the way
[5:48] I preach it not something that look like
[5:51] it but the real thing say it with me the
[5:54] real thing that's what Paul preached and
[5:58] the real Holy Ghost brings for for the
[5:59] same kind of an Evidence and proof at
[6:02] they head back there it comes with the
[6:03] same Holy Ghost Hallelujah and everybody
[6:07] said okay now so therefore we we want to
[6:11] take a look at this because this is
[6:12] interesting uh in the Old Testament the
[6:15] only way that people had to learn about
[6:17] God was if somebody told them because
[6:19] they didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[6:21] Spirit right so there are a lots of
[6:23] scriptures that are like this
[6:24] Deuteronomy chapter 4 take heed to
[6:26] thyself this is Moses speaking to the uh
[6:29] of the fathers and keep thy Soul
[6:30] diligently lest thou forget the things
[6:32] which thine eyes have seen and lest they
[6:34] depart from thy heart with all the days
[6:36] of thy life so fathers had to have it
[6:38] but look what he said but teach them to
[6:40] thy sons and thy Sons Sons so our
[6:44] responsibility as fathers and
[6:45] grandfathers was to pass on the
[6:47] knowledge the exploits the Miracles the
[6:49] testimonies the Commandments of God pass
[6:51] them on to our children because you know
[6:53] what they didn't have an altar call like
[6:55] we have they didn't have uh you know
[6:58] what the baptism of the Holy Spirit this
[6:59] is prior to the day of Pentecost and so
[7:01] therefore the way that young people knew
[7:03] about God is that somebody told them
[7:06] over later in the New Testament we find
[7:09] that in the Book of Ezekiel and you'll
[7:11] also find this in Jeremiah CH 31 God
[7:13] begins to elude to this new thing and if
[7:16] you find in jeremi Jeremiah 31
[7:19] 3435 uh Jeremiah starts talking about
[7:22] behold I'll do a new thing in the earth
[7:24] and God keeps saying about this new
[7:26] thing and he says in Ezekiel CH 36 he's
[7:29] prepping Israel for what's coming he
[7:31] said then I will sprinkle when I do this
[7:34] new thing I'll sprinkle water upon you
[7:36] and you shall be clean from all your
[7:38] filthiness from all your Idols will I
[7:39] cleanse you and a new heart will I also
[7:42] give you hey nobody knew what that meant
[7:45] right nobody knew what that meant a new
[7:47] heart wow
[7:49] dude and they're listening to him talk
[7:51] about it and he says and a new spirit
[7:54] will I put within you and I'll take away
[7:56] the Stony heart out of your flesh and
[7:57] I'll give you a give you and heart of
[8:00] Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[8:02] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[8:05] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[8:06] them you're not going to need somebody
[8:08] to tell you or teach you who God is
[8:10] you'll know because you will have met
[8:12] God and God will actually put a portion
[8:14] of his spirit and his life in you that's
[8:17] right and that will cause you to walk in
[8:19] his statutes and in his ways does that
[8:22] make sense the Old Testament they never
[8:24] had this experience but God was telling
[8:26] him it was it was coming in Acts 13 uh
[8:29] uh the the uh the promise was taken from
[8:32] the Jews and given to the Gentiles and
[8:34] when that happened you know what we were
[8:36] privy to the new birth and so today
[8:38] you're the benefactor of this right here
[8:40] this is what God Said I believe it'll go
[8:42] back to the Jews but today you're the
[8:44] people who uh dwell in the land last
[8:47] verse dwell in the land that I gave your
[8:49] fathers and ye shall be my people and
[8:51] I'll be your God in other words this is
[8:53] not just uh you know the awareness of
[8:55] The Commandments and knowledge of God
[8:57] but he's talking about a relationship
[8:59] here this is a new relationship with me
[9:01] and God said I don't want to be just
[9:03] giving you stones with Commandments on
[9:04] it I want to actually walk with you I
[9:06] want to be with you I want to live in
[9:08] you I want to fellowship with you in a
[9:10] way that nobody's ever had it before
[9:12] except maybe Adam in the Garden of Eden
[9:14] when God walked and talked with him
[9:15] right everybody following I'm at 220
[9:18] gusting to 220 so stay with me so
[9:21] therefore uh this is this is what God
[9:24] promised Israel and I believe that the
[9:26] new birth therefore is an essential
[9:28] thing so let's put it this way I'm a
[9:31] graphic guy so let's put it this way we
[9:33] know that our sin separated us from God
[9:36] didn't it and there was nothing really
[9:38] we could do about that people try to
[9:39] deal with that in different ways they
[9:42] try to do good deeds they try to live a
[9:43] moral life uh they will try to uh go to
[9:46] church enough they'll try to uh you know
[9:48] give out give money or whatever else and
[9:51] all of it falls short because there is
[9:53] no way to close that gap between us and
[9:56] God but the good news is that Jesus
[9:59] Christ stood in the Gap paid the price
[10:01] and made it possible to have this
[10:03] relationship with God isn't that right
[10:06] how many are thankful for that brother B
[10:09] said in desperation Methodist say well
[10:10] when you get happy enough to shout
[10:12] that's it Pentecostal say speak in
[10:14] tongues and you got it and we find out
[10:16] that all of it was wrong are they bad
[10:18] things no they're not bad things but the
[10:20] initial evidence is not a gift the
[10:22] initial evidence is not a feeling the
[10:25] evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing
[10:26] the word for your day isn't that right
[10:28] the token is the token it's you and
[10:30] Christ as persons together it's the Holy
[10:33] Spirit his life in you working his own
[10:35] life through you my question to you this
[10:37] morning is what does that look like what
[10:40] does that look like when you come down
[10:41] the aisle from the altar we hear a lot
[10:44] about uh you know coming into the altar
[10:45] surrendering uh receiving the baptism of
[10:47] the holy spirit it's all true it's all
[10:49] biblical it's all right it's all
[10:51] appropriate but what does it look like
[10:53] when you walk back down the aisle and go
[10:55] to your seat what does it look like when
[10:57] you drive home and now you're living in
[10:59] your house and you find that uh even
[11:01] though you've had a new experience you
[11:02] go back to a house where everything is
[11:04] the same as it was before you left what
[11:07] does it look like when you go to your
[11:08] job or your school or your uh your
[11:10] church and everything is just the same
[11:12] as what it was before you left for camp
[11:15] and so I'm asking you this morning what
[11:17] does it look like over these two
[11:18] sessions we're going to talk about what
[11:20] that looks like okay so uh that's that's
[11:23] a theme and we want to make sure that
[11:26] first of all we have the real thing and
[11:28] Rahab said I don't want to have a faith
[11:30] and I don't want to have a counterfeit
[11:31] and I just don't want to have a good
[11:32] feeling and a fuzzy uh fuzzy feeling
[11:34] here I want to have the real thing I
[11:36] want to have the real Goods cuz I know I
[11:38] know Jericho's going down brother B said
[11:41] in the message
[11:42] sorry brother B said in the message like
[11:45] he said that's the way it is with some
[11:47] of the shaan's religion I believe in
[11:50] being born again and everybody said go
[11:53] back to the beginning die out and be
[11:55] remolded and if you don't there's going
[11:56] to be a blow up down the road uh along
[11:59] the road it'll blow up on you when the
[12:01] pressure comes right you're going to
[12:03] need to have something let me tell you
[12:05] uh with with the things that are
[12:07] happening in the world uh today and
[12:09] things that are happening in Israel and
[12:10] that's our time clock isn't it Israel's
[12:12] our time clock the Gentiles are not the
[12:14] time piece Israel is a Time piece and
[12:17] there are significant things that are
[12:19] changing in Israel that will never be
[12:21] the same 9/11 prove to us that the world
[12:24] can change in a very short period of
[12:26] time they're calling this their 911
[12:29] therefore it'll never be the same in
[12:30] Israel or in the Middle East ever again
[12:33] and so therefore you need to be ready
[12:35] because God's going to roll on he's
[12:37] going to roll on and he's not going to
[12:38] be very sympathetic to your excuses for
[12:41] not rolling on with God and he wants you
[12:43] to he wants you to grow up and like
[12:45] brother Andrew said uh you know we're
[12:46] not children anymore you're old enough
[12:48] to come to Camp you're old enough to uh
[12:50] you know be here without your parents
[12:51] most of you and uh I think it's an
[12:54] important thing for us to recognize the
[12:55] hour that we've come to but you know
[12:57] that right you know that here's two
[12:59] things that we also need to remind
[13:00] ourselves of number one John 10 they
[13:04] said to Jesus if thou be the Christ tell
[13:07] us plainly tell us in a way that we
[13:09] don't have to have Revelation to know on
[13:11] cuz they didn't have any Revelation
[13:13] right so just tell us plainly and Jesus
[13:15] answered them and said I told you and
[13:18] you believe not the works that I do in
[13:20] my father's name they bear witness of me
[13:24] that's right but ye believe not because
[13:26] you are not of my sheep and I said unto
[13:28] you my sheep hear my voice and I know
[13:31] them and they follow me we don't know
[13:33] how this works but we know it works
[13:36] right and I give unto them eternal life
[13:39] and they shall never Perish Say that
[13:41] with me never perish neither shall any
[13:44] man pluck them out of my hand glory to
[13:46] God in other words you can't be taken
[13:49] away if you're if you're a possession of
[13:51] God if you're a gene of God you can't be
[13:53] plucked out of his hand all of you
[13:56] should say a quiet and deep amen thank
[13:58] you Jesus because you don't always feel
[14:00] close to God right you don't always feel
[14:02] like you got it right you don't always
[14:04] feel like you got it all together but I
[14:06] will tell you this if Jesus said no one
[14:08] can pluck them out of my hand you ought
[14:10] to go out of here a little bit more
[14:11] confident than when you came in the
[14:13] second thing that we need to know as we
[14:15] go into this is found in Luke chapter 8
[14:18] and this is a story of gadera and when
[14:21] Jesus sailed across the uh the sea and
[14:24] went to the other side of gadera where
[14:26] the land of gadera that's where the man
[14:28] was who was possessed with the Legion of
[14:29] devils remember the story everybody
[14:31] remember the story put your hand up some
[14:33] of you do all right so this guy was
[14:35] possessed by a legion of devils and
[14:37] nobody went near him and nobody went
[14:39] near the area that he lived okay and uh
[14:43] Jesus rolls up there in a boat and uh
[14:46] you know he he walks up and this demon
[14:48] recognizes Jesus Jesus recognizes the
[14:50] demon and this is just after he calmed
[14:53] the storm remember on the sea and all of
[14:55] this and the disciples were thinking wow
[14:57] you know man it can't get any better
[14:58] better than this but just watch so Jesus
[15:03] has this confrontation with this man
[15:05] listen now he has a confrontation with
[15:07] this man and those demons are cast out
[15:10] they go into the swine the swine run
[15:12] down the hill the people in the village
[15:13] are upset uh because that's our
[15:15] livelihood after all you know my
[15:16] goodness you could have got a flock of
[15:18] birds but uh you send all our livelihood
[15:21] down into the sea and now they're all
[15:23] dead now what's interesting is this
[15:27] okay the Bible says in Luke
[15:30] 8 then they went out to see what was
[15:33] done the people in the village went out
[15:36] to see what was done because news travel
[15:39] fast they didn't need to have texting in
[15:41] that day to know what took place when
[15:43] Jesus came through something always
[15:44] happened and word spray quickly and they
[15:47] and they went out to see what was done
[15:49] and they came to Jesus and found the man
[15:53] out of whom the Devils were departed
[15:56] sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed and
[15:59] then he's right in
[16:00] mine and they were
[16:02] afraid all right there's two things that
[16:05] are significant here number one is that
[16:08] that man needed to experience God in a
[16:11] real way right he needed to have that
[16:14] encounter with God and the miraculous
[16:16] and the supernatural happen I believe
[16:19] that many times that's necessary when
[16:21] somebody uh is bound by uh demons or
[16:24] Darkness they need to come and they need
[16:26] to be delivered by the Lord Jesus
[16:28] himself and I believe he's still able to
[16:30] do that I hope you do too yes sir and
[16:33] when they found this man the result of
[16:35] that Supernatural experience was now he
[16:38] dresses right now he's acting right and
[16:41] now he's probably got long sleeves cuz
[16:42] he's covered up his tattoos and he's
[16:44] just sitting there and listening to
[16:46] Jesus he's just sitting there and he
[16:49] wants to be wherever Jesus
[16:51] is matter of fact Jesus tells him to go
[16:54] home and tell his family what's been
[16:56] done he said hey no I want to stick
[16:57] around here I want to hear what you have
[16:59] to say because if I can have that kind
[17:01] of an experience I want to hang around
[17:03] where you are I want to be where you are
[17:05] my point is this I believe we need to
[17:07] have both kinds of experiences the
[17:10] supernatural experience where we meet
[17:12] God but also the experience of sitting
[17:14] at the feet of Jesus and learning what
[17:16] he has to say I believe he need both
[17:19] it's not just one it's not just a
[17:21] supernatural over and over again because
[17:23] after those demons were cast out he
[17:25] didn't say to Jesus do it again he
[17:28] didn't say that right he got he got
[17:31] dressed sat down at the feet of Jesus
[17:32] and he said I want to hear what he has
[17:34] to say but it is not just an
[17:36] intellectual process where he sits down
[17:38] and listens to teaching he's experienced
[17:40] the Supernatural and now he's learning
[17:42] the word of God he's subjecting himself
[17:45] to the word of God I believe that you
[17:46] need both and I believe this if you have
[17:49] a real encounter with God it'll bring
[17:52] you to the feet of Jesus Amen did you
[17:54] hear me I believe if you have a real
[17:56] encounter with God not just an emotional
[17:58] work up but if you have an encounter
[18:00] with God it'll drive you to the word of
[18:02] God it'll drive you to a place where you
[18:04] can have your soul fed now because
[18:05] you're feeding on the right thing did
[18:07] everybody agree amen so let's look now
[18:10] at what those are two things that we
[18:11] know a token is a representation of
[18:15] something that's required it is
[18:17] something that uh is an exchange a
[18:19] voucher can be exchanged for something
[18:22] uh for goods or services like a plane
[18:24] ticket and the plane ticket in itself
[18:27] means oh its value is zero uh because
[18:30] it's just a little piece of paper but it
[18:32] represents something right it represents
[18:35] the fact that you paid a price and this
[18:37] is what uh this is what uh Rahab wanted
[18:41] so you might ask the question and it
[18:42] would be a very legitimate question at
[18:44] this point how do I get it how do I get
[18:46] the token that's a good question thank
[18:49] you for asking the good question here's
[18:51] what brother man said the token is a
[18:53] sign that the purchase has been paid
[18:56] that's right right and been accepted and
[19:00] you can't get the token from the
[19:02] railroad until you pay the price now
[19:04] somebody has to pay the price in our
[19:06] case we didn't have to pay the price
[19:08] Jesus did everybody say thank you Jesus
[19:11] thank you Jesus and believe it and
[19:12] accept it and full
[19:15] obedience I'm a repeater so say full
[19:18] obedience full obedience now right I say
[19:21] it with passion all right full obedience
[19:24] full
[19:25] obedience entitles you to the tokal yes
[19:28] full obedience to the whole word of God
[19:31] will entitle you to the Token full
[19:33] obedience is anybody
[19:36] unclear not the part of it as your
[19:39] denomination goes right but all of it
[19:43] full obedience to the word which is
[19:46] Christ everybody
[19:48] agree all right let's give it a shot
[19:50] let's try out try it out and see whether
[19:53] you believe it or not brother random
[19:55] says in the odd ball when a man kisses
[19:58] you he has potentially committed
[20:00] adultery with you he's talking to girl
[20:03] everybody say
[20:05] girl you should never let him kiss you
[20:07] until you're married when male and Fe
[20:10] and he explains this when male and
[20:11] female glands come together he said Let
[20:13] It Be Where it may be you have
[20:15] potentially committed adultery if you're
[20:16] not married right right for us for us
[20:21] intimacy intimacy follows commitment
[20:24] Yeah in our world today it's reversed
[20:26] right intimacy precedes
[20:28] commitment but in our world commitment
[20:31] comes first intimacy comes later so he
[20:34] says you shouldn't let a boy kiss you
[20:35] until that fail is raised on your face
[20:37] and you're his wife don't do that it's
[20:40] committing adultery it's mixing male and
[20:43] female glands that's right how many of
[20:45] you believe that full obedience to the
[20:46] Token will uh will entitle you to the
[20:49] Token yeah you know what that's that's
[20:52] something that we had to be fully
[20:53] obedient to everybody all right yeah
[20:56] okay like Andrew said last last night
[20:58] I'm here I might as well preach it
[21:01] that's the way you said it
[21:03] too can I give you another one brother
[21:07] Ram said and be certain of God he said
[21:08] but then in ahab's wedding I mean that
[21:10] must have been quite a wedding right as
[21:12] you got this this mix and instead of
[21:15] marrying among his own people he married
[21:17] a sinner an idolator and he married
[21:20] Jezebel and she was not a Believer yeah
[21:24] and no believer should ever marry an
[21:29] believer under no
[21:32] circumstances unless you met her online
[21:35] no it doesn't say that under no
[21:39] circumstances should always marry
[21:43] Believers that's right I'm a repeater
[21:46] say this after me always marry
[21:49] Believers all right now you say it all
[21:52] right always Mary believer all right now
[21:55] this is one you got to say with passion
[21:56] all right always marry
[22:00] Believers but they have't done this evil
[22:03] thing in the eyes of a prophet here he's
[22:05] calling out an evil thing and no doubt
[22:06] Jezebel was a beautiful woman
[22:10] watch and he fell for what she'd looked
[22:13] like instead of what she was
[22:17] wow she fell he fell for what she looked
[22:21] like instead of what she was and so many
[22:25] people make that same mistake today yeah
[22:29] you believe that full obedience entitles
[22:30] you to the Token here's a that's a real
[22:33] good thing for you to be obedient too
[22:34] that's for sure all right so let's stand
[22:36] back now again and we look at the ages
[22:38] and we've come to the end of the ages as
[22:40] you all know and God's very fixated on
[22:42] on Israel and Jerusalem and uh watch for
[22:44] that that's only going to increase and
[22:46] we know we know by virtue of just
[22:49] biblical understanding that the church
[22:51] goes into apostasy leacy and darkness in
[22:53] this season and a judgment cycle begins
[22:56] but a bride arises up out of that and
[22:58] she's identified and she's aware of the
[23:01] fact that she's living in a bright age
[23:02] and a Rapture cycle actually begins
[23:05] number three the cycle of restoration of
[23:07] Israel begins and I say to you today
[23:09] it's already begun and number four the
[23:11] Antichrist begins to rise in innocence
[23:14] not in power not in dominance but he
[23:16] rises in innocence everybody okay and
[23:19] Paul also says about that time that uh
[23:21] parous times will be the characteristic
[23:24] of our day and perilous times in the
[23:26] Greek language is means Fierce there
[23:29] will come times there will come days
[23:31] that are I mean it's pretty it's pretty
[23:33] fierce in other words you have Fierce
[23:35] opposition to the way uh God wants you
[23:37] to live the Holy Spirit wants you to
[23:39] live a certain way Satan is fiercely
[23:41] opposed to that right not just opposed
[23:43] to that but fiercely opposed to that
[23:45] right and he's going to do whatever he
[23:47] can and the majority of stuff that he
[23:48] does is right here we're not being
[23:51] chased around by armies and we're not
[23:52] being uh you know imprisoned by police
[23:54] we are being trouble right here and a
[23:56] lot of you are sitting there even after
[23:58] last night thinking well I don't have it
[23:59] and I'm not good enough and maybe I made
[24:01] a mistake and maybe God doesn't love me
[24:02] and you're still thinking that and
[24:04] that's because you have Fierce
[24:05] opposition uh to what God wants you to
[24:07] say we are at a point where we are at a
[24:10] point where it's not profitable for you
[24:12] to believe what anybody else says about
[24:13] you but God Amen I said we're at a point
[24:16] where uh you need to be sure you're
[24:17] believing what God says about you and
[24:19] not somebody
[24:20] else we find that in those hours of real
[24:23] stress that's usually when the spirit of
[24:25] God moves in and he let the Hebrew
[24:27] children walk right into the fiery
[24:28] furnace before he ever moved a hand but
[24:31] when he moves he moves yeah all right
[24:33] let's say it this way God brought those
[24:35] children of Israel at three to the edge
[24:37] of impossible didn't he I mean now the
[24:41] fire is hot and it gets seven times
[24:42] hotter right and now it's impossible for
[24:45] anybody to survive in the atmosphere of
[24:47] that fire and it's impossible to take
[24:49] another step and God says go ahead and
[24:51] make another step he brought him to the
[24:54] edge of impossible and he said he said
[24:56] go ahead now we don't find anywhere
[24:57] where God talks to them and says lo I'll
[25:00] be with you even in the Flames he
[25:01] doesn't say that but those guys know
[25:03] simply one thing that no matter what
[25:06] happens here no matter if God shows up
[25:08] now or if he doesn't we know we're not
[25:10] going to bow to that Idol that's right
[25:12] so whatever takes place now is in the
[25:14] hands of God and we're not going to bow
[25:16] to that that's for sure that's what we
[25:18] do know we don't know what the future
[25:19] holds I mean the sure don't look good
[25:21] but we're we're not going to bow to
[25:23] Idols everybody with me and they're at
[25:25] the edge of impossible and and and and
[25:27] they take another step and when they
[25:29] took another step God met them right
[25:31] there in that place of the above
[25:34] impossible and I'm telling you today I
[25:36] believe we're coming to an hour when
[25:38] we're going to be at the edge of
[25:39] impossible and we need to make another
[25:41] step because there's no going back and I
[25:43] believe when we do God will receive us
[25:45] and meet us at that moment and Deliver
[25:47] us just like he did then if that means
[25:50] what it says right there because when
[25:51] the real stress comes that's when the
[25:53] holy spirit moves in yes sir and
[25:55] remember this if there ain't no pressure
[25:57] there ain't no Diamond that's right
[25:59] everybody okay all right I'm going to
[26:01] move on because I got to move on all
[26:04] right now whenever I do this at home and
[26:07] I have a PowerPoint I always put an
[26:09] aster that a really important quote so
[26:12] that people who are asleep don't wake up
[26:14] or somebody is uh going to wake them up
[26:16] when the uh Quotes come that have an
[26:18] asterics on it now and you can't see the
[26:21] asteris here but I not only have one but
[26:24] I got two I got two
[26:28] I got two quotes here two aspects
[26:30] because this is really important this is
[26:32] really important okay brother the last
[26:36] sermon in this life he says now there's
[26:38] um he says in leadership we're supposed
[26:41] to
[26:42] represent God and eternal life then we
[26:46] should conduct ourselves women and men
[26:49] like the Bible said for us to do you
[26:51] know why because we're representing God
[26:54] and eternal life we are actually his
[26:56] Representatives we're ambassadors for
[26:57] him yes Christian gentlemen Sons and
[27:00] Daughters of
[27:01] God born of the spirit of God
[27:04] manifesting the light in our day and
[27:08] scattering that's worth reading again
[27:10] because it's got two Asters on it we're
[27:12] supposed to represent God in eternal
[27:13] life and then we should conduct
[27:15] ourselves women and men like the Bible
[27:16] said for us to do Christian gentlemen
[27:18] Sons and Daughters of God born of the
[27:19] spirit of God what a sent this is all
[27:21] one sentence you know that and
[27:23] manifesting the light in our day and
[27:24] scattering so it's not good enough for
[27:26] you just to know it you got to scatter
[27:28] it you got to be active in representing
[27:30] the kingdom to the world you're in and
[27:32] God put you in this age on purpose and
[27:34] God put you in your school on purpose
[27:36] and God put you in your church on
[27:37] purpose and God put you in your job on
[27:39] purpose cuz God knows what he's doing
[27:41] who knew God knew what he was doing but
[27:43] he does right so you're supposed to
[27:46] represent God and the kingdom and
[27:48] eternal life so when people see you in
[27:50] other words the Bible says that I should
[27:53] be able to take any one of you and put
[27:55] you in a crowd and say this is what the
[27:56] message
[27:58] produces this is what the message
[28:00] represents but the Bible says that I
[28:02] should be able to do
[28:04] that and I should be able to go to any
[28:06] one of you without reservation and say
[28:08] hey you're all professors you all
[28:10] profess to believe in the message I
[28:11] should be able to take you and stand you
[28:13] right here and say that's what the
[28:14] message
[28:15] produces the message does not produce
[28:18] cut hair and you know split skirts and
[28:20] all the rest of it I believe that no
[28:22] matter where we are breakfast whether
[28:24] we're in school or whatever else
[28:25] remember you're representing the kingdom
[28:27] of of God you're his representative on
[28:29] this Earth you're not responsible for
[28:31] getting there you're not responsible for
[28:33] changing your body you're representative
[28:35] you're you're sorry you're responsible
[28:36] for representing the kingdom of God
[28:38] right here and expressing what the mind
[28:41] of Christ acts like right and what the
[28:44] spirit of God can do in a human being
[28:45] and rescue them out of the out of the
[28:47] gutter of immorality and have them stand
[28:49] like a Son of God believing that one day
[28:51] my body is going to be changed because
[28:52] God said so right everybody okay so
[28:56] let's give you an example of somebody
[28:57] who I believe had the real thing and his
[29:00] name is David Livingston David
[29:02] Livingston was born in Blantyre Scotland
[29:03] in 1913 great man and he had a passion
[29:07] as a young boy he memorized Psalm 119
[29:10] and uh he he just had this passion and
[29:12] he had a diary and in that diary he said
[29:15] that the smoke of the burning of a
[29:17] thousand fires in Africa ignites my soul
[29:20] had never been there but he knew somehow
[29:22] he would wind up in Africa he was a
[29:24] cartographer in other words he was a mat
[29:26] maker and a lot of Africa was never
[29:28] mapped and so therefore he was sent by
[29:31] the London Bible society and the London
[29:33] uh geographical Society over to Africa
[29:36] and they paid his way and he wound up
[29:37] going uh to up the zambesi river on the
[29:40] on the east coast of Tanzania uh which
[29:42] was tanganica back then and uh he went
[29:45] and when he went uh he was just newly
[29:47] married and his wife Mary came with him
[29:49] but she caught malaria and had to go
[29:51] home as a matter of fact in in
[29:52] Livingston's life he only spent 5 years
[29:54] total with his wife and had a bunch of
[29:56] kids but he only only spend 5 years with
[29:58] his wife because she got sick some of
[29:59] the kids got sick and they wound up
[30:01] going back to London and living there
[30:04] but Livingston went and when he went he
[30:06] said to God he said God send me anywhere
[30:10] only go with me and lay any burden on me
[30:12] only sustain me and sever any tie in my
[30:15] heart except the tie that binds my heart
[30:18] to yours amen that's what he prayed to
[30:20] God when he left and he said Lord send
[30:22] me anywhere only go with me and that was
[30:24] his calling card he believed that
[30:26] wherever he went God was with him and
[30:28] God would sustain him but in that
[30:30] experience of being in Africa he caught
[30:32] malaria and he was actually quite sick
[30:34] and he and he he uh he died with malaria
[30:37] because there was no there is no cure uh
[30:39] for malaria and he he took a medicine
[30:41] that allowed him to have a little relief
[30:43] from the pain and the suffering of
[30:45] malaria and so uh Livingston uh was a
[30:49] you know a Relentless uh missionary and
[30:51] went from Village to Village and uh he
[30:54] had to deal with all the problems uh
[30:56] that were there as a as a matter of fact
[30:58] uh one day Livingston was walking under
[30:59] a tree and he didn't realize it but
[31:01] there was a line uh perched in the tree
[31:03] and the line fell out of the tree on him
[31:05] and clumped onto his shoulder and he
[31:07] could never use his left arm after that
[31:10] he had a bad fall and he limped all the
[31:12] rest of his life he was walking through
[31:13] the jungle one day and there was a
[31:15] broken branch that had pierced him right
[31:17] in the eye and he only had one eye that
[31:19] he could see out of in the end of his
[31:21] life Livingston was a Relentless man of
[31:24] God and over time he ran R out of his
[31:27] medicine and he suffered greatly and he
[31:30] prayed and he said Lord you said that if
[31:33] you sent me you'd be with me and you'd
[31:35] take care of me according to this prayer
[31:36] right here and he prayed often and asked
[31:39] God to help him one day there was a man
[31:41] who showed up on behalf of the newspaper
[31:43] and his name was Stanley you heard the
[31:45] phrase Stanley Livingston right and
[31:47] Stanley boed himself as being the
[31:49] biggest loudest atheist in the world and
[31:53] he showed up and he said Dr Livingston I
[31:55] presume that's where that phrase came
[31:58] from he W walked through the jungle and
[32:00] finally found caught up with Livingston
[32:01] and he said hey he said Dr Livingston I
[32:04] presume and so he warned he warned
[32:07] Livingston Stanley did he says well I'm
[32:10] here to they sent me to try to find out
[32:12] if you're still alive cuz nobody's heard
[32:13] from you uh they didn't have good email
[32:15] back in that day and so he said I'm here
[32:17] to find out if you're still alive and I
[32:19] found you he said I'm going to stay with
[32:21] you a little while but he said whatever
[32:22] you do don't try to convert me oh and by
[32:24] the way here's some medicine that
[32:26] somebody gave me for you wow and handed
[32:28] him the medicine that he used for the
[32:30] rest of his life 4 months later Stanley
[32:33] was Stanley was converted walking with
[32:35] Livingston through the woods at the end
[32:38] of his life at the end of his life
[32:40] Livingston was almost crippled with
[32:42] malaria he was only in his early 60s but
[32:45] he was almost crippled with arthritis
[32:46] and malaria and in his last day he
[32:49] walked back to his Hut and he had a
[32:51] servant who went with him everywhere
[32:53] great big guy and he walked with him
[32:55] everywhere his name was Chum
[32:57] and when he walked inside of his cabin
[32:59] uh a little bunk that he had there and
[33:01] he had a chair and a desk and so forth
[33:03] and he said to chuma he said I can't
[33:05] make it to my bed and and chuma picked
[33:07] him up and brought him to the edge of
[33:09] his bed and and he said Livingston said
[33:11] hey don't put me in the bed put me next
[33:13] to the bed and he knelt down on his
[33:15] crippled knees and prayed there the next
[33:17] morning chuma came in the room and
[33:18] Livingstone was still there but he was
[33:21] dead that's where he died in prayer wow
[33:24] and when he died it was 150 mi from his
[33:27] Hut to the coast and it was a boat that
[33:29] was leaving for London and so they were
[33:31] going to put his body onto the boat and
[33:33] sail it back to London and today you can
[33:35] visit his grave in London but a very
[33:37] interesting thing happened when chuma
[33:39] laid him down on the coastline at the
[33:41] warf where the boat was he took a knife
[33:44] and he cut the heart out of Livingston
[33:46] and he took it in his hand and buried it
[33:48] under a tree he said you can take his
[33:50] body back to London but he said his
[33:51] heart belongs in after wow let me ask
[33:55] you a question do you do you think
[33:57] Livingston had the real thing yes sir do
[33:59] you believe he had the real thing yes my
[34:02] goodness I believe this saints of God I
[34:05] believe this like Livingston said if you
[34:08] have men who will only come if they know
[34:10] there's a good road I don't want to
[34:12] that's right I want men who will come if
[34:14] there's no Road at
[34:15] all I don't want believers who will come
[34:18] if there's only a good road I don't want
[34:20] them I don't tell you what in the same
[34:22] way I don't believe that God wants
[34:23] Believers today that are only here if
[34:25] they have a good camp and they have lots
[34:27] of good food and they have uh foosball
[34:29] or whatever it is swoosh ball or
[34:31] something kind of ball uh in the
[34:33] afternoon nothing against it here but
[34:35] that's not the reason we ought to be
[34:36] here you know what those are secondary
[34:38] things the most important thing that you
[34:40] need to experience here is not a game a
[34:43] pool I believe it's the Lord Jesus
[34:45] Christ himself and that's our
[34:48] living Don't Clap hold on Don't Clap I
[34:51] don't have time people people speak to
[34:54] me Livingston said sorry people speak to
[34:58] me of the sacrifice that I
[35:02] made and they talk about I have made in
[35:05] the sacrifice I've made in spending my
[35:07] my life in Africa he said can that be
[35:10] called a sacrifice which is simply paid
[35:11] back as a small part of a great debt
[35:13] owing to God which we can never
[35:16] repap is that a sacrifice which brings
[35:18] its own blessed reward uh in in doing
[35:21] good and peace of mind and a bright hope
[35:23] of a glorious Destiny afterwards away
[35:26] with the world and such a view and with
[35:27] such a thought it is emphatically No
[35:31] sacrifice for me at all glory to God
[35:34] Amen everybody all right only got a
[35:36] couple of minutes left so Paul writes
[35:38] this word and he says I'm crucified with
[35:41] Christ nevertheless I I live not yet not
[35:43] I he says but the life which I now live
[35:47] in the flesh I live by the faith of the
[35:49] Son of God who loved me and gave himself
[35:51] for me that's right that's real life
[35:53] that's what the word actually means
[35:54] there it means to be blessed and endless
[35:57] in the kingdom of God you not only have
[35:59] uh life in this life but you have life
[36:01] in the world to come you believe that so
[36:05] let me tell you something there are
[36:06] characteristics of that life and I you
[36:09] know I I'm a I've studied the Bible for
[36:11] 40 years and I've been preaching it for
[36:13] almost the same and I I there's some
[36:15] passages I think I'm familiar with and
[36:17] there's some I ain't and one of them is
[36:19] the Book of Job and I'll be honest to
[36:21] tell you that but I found something in
[36:22] the first chapter of the book of jel and
[36:23] I studied a Hebrew and what God actually
[36:25] said in in in his uh dealings with the
[36:28] prophets but I I found this passage here
[36:31] and it intrigued me because the Bible
[36:33] said that job offered sacrifices for
[36:35] your children and they never sinned now
[36:37] that always struck me because I thought
[36:39] as a father do I need to be offering
[36:41] sacrifices for my son they're all
[36:43] Rascals I no I mean they're all good
[36:45] boys but do I do I need to offer
[36:49] sacrifices for my sons even though
[36:50] they're all in the message and they're
[36:51] all uh they're all uh you know in Christ
[36:55] and I I I wondered about that pondered
[36:57] about this for years and and job had
[37:00] seven sons and three daughters and this
[37:01] was kind of a regular occurrence for
[37:03] them to get together and have feasts and
[37:04] so forth and he they uh they they did
[37:08] this uh you know with with regularity
[37:10] and it was so in the days of feasting
[37:11] were gone about that job sent and
[37:13] Sanctified them rose up early in the
[37:14] morning and offered burnt offering for
[37:17] he said it may be that it may be I don't
[37:20] know that they have but it may be that
[37:22] my sons and daughters have sinned in
[37:24] their heart thus did God continue
[37:27] now that's interesting and why do you
[37:28] bring it up good question because job
[37:31] was offering sacrifices to counter the
[37:34] spirit of
[37:36] entitlement in the language this is what
[37:38] it says let me Define what entitlement
[37:40] is you remember when non went to elishah
[37:43] to get healed remember that and he sends
[37:46] word in hey non's here the enemy of
[37:49] God's people but I'm here anyway and uh
[37:51] you know I got leprosy I'm not going to
[37:53] live unless this great prophet does
[37:54] something and the prophet sends out his
[37:56] servant and nonon says hey yeah right a
[38:01] servant no way who does he think I am
[38:04] I'm entitled at least to a visit by the
[38:07] prophet himself I'm out of here and he
[38:10] turns and walks away some sensible
[38:12] servant came to him and said hey you
[38:14] know what why do you got to lose I mean
[38:16] why do you got to lose you're going to
[38:17] die
[38:19] right and nonon says well I guess so but
[38:22] I thought I was entitled more than that
[38:24] that's the spirit of entitlement
[38:27] so now watch job is offering sacrifices
[38:29] for his kids you know why because
[38:31] they're job's kids and they feel like
[38:34] huh you know our our dad our dad's a
[38:36] prophet and you know we've been in a
[38:39] camp I'm friends with Andrew GL bless
[38:43] go and I I you know I I I I got all the
[38:47] I got all the t-shirts from all the
[38:50] camps and I uh you know my dad's a
[38:53] deacon in the
[38:55] church and as a result of that you can
[38:58] begin I'm not saying you now I'm not
[39:00] saying you at all but you may know
[39:01] somebody who needs to hear this all
[39:03] right there comes a feeling that oh well
[39:07] you know maybe I can bend the rules just
[39:09] a little bit after all after all I'm
[39:17] Josh and I you know everybody knows my
[39:20] name when I say when I say I'm a benett
[39:23] they say oh wow you're Josh
[39:25] Bennett and you know what job did job
[39:28] knew that that kind of an attitude of
[39:30] entitlement can cause his children to go
[39:34] astray while they're right in the
[39:37] message and he's offering sacrifices
[39:41] just in case just in case I'm saying to
[39:44] you this morning if you have the real
[39:46] thing this is one thing you need to be
[39:48] guarded about that you don't get an
[39:50] attitude of entitlement and say well hey
[39:52] you know what I've got um I've got
[39:55] seniority around here I've I've been to
[39:57] three camps I'm 16 years old you know I
[39:59] got seniority
[40:00] around because when you get to feel
[40:03] entitled you get to feel well you know
[40:06] uh I can I can do something and fire
[40:08] lightning hasn't fallen out of the sky
[40:09] so I'm
[40:11] okay brother man gives a really
[40:13] interesting example he's in a
[40:15] psychiatric hospital and he's talking to
[40:17] a young lady who's there and the
[40:18] psychiatrist came in and set down and
[40:20] talked to this girl and he said to her
[40:23] you mean youve never been kissed by a
[40:26] boy and she said not one time you mean
[40:29] you've never had a little drink and been
[40:30] to a party this is the doctor talking to
[40:32] her now he's trying to figure out what's
[40:34] wrong with her he's looking at it from a
[40:35] natural point of view and she said never
[40:38] said girl you don't know what you're
[40:39] missing you're missing out you're not
[40:41] you're not living life you're missing
[40:42] out on everything now him being the
[40:44] psychiatrist he swung the girl's mind
[40:48] until she has become so evil and so bad
[40:50] till she didn't even want to hear the
[40:52] name of Jesus spoke in her presence good
[40:55] you know what he did purposely
[40:56] influenced her mind and it's because
[40:59] that she turned her thoughts from Christ
[41:02] onto where that psychiatrist was moving
[41:04] her
[41:05] mind now watch what he says and that's
[41:08] what we're here for this morning is to
[41:10] move your mind and your thinking from
[41:12] the things of the world unto the things
[41:15] of God which are Eternal hey wake up
[41:18] there's somebody moving your mind one
[41:20] way or the other one way or the other
[41:24] you want to make sure the right side is
[41:25] moving your mind you want to make sure
[41:27] you're hearing the right thing you want
[41:29] to make sure that you've not been to
[41:30] enough camps that you become numb to the
[41:33] things that are said but if it's the
[41:34] word of God you ought to say Amen to it
[41:36] because you can begin to feel like oh
[41:38] well you know what I've been around and
[41:40] I've heard it all before and I'm good
[41:42] I'm the curve I'm good God doesn't grade
[41:44] by the curve God grades you grades you
[41:46] as an individual God looks at you as an
[41:48] individual and he does not he does not
[41:52] grade you on the curve again here's Ruth
[41:54] and Naomi brother said a type again in
[41:57] the Gentile bride how many people here
[41:58] are members of the Gentile bride half of
[42:01] you are all right this is for you and
[42:04] and they said well I'll I'll forsake
[42:06] everything and I'm going with you let
[42:08] your people be my people and so forth he
[42:09] said that's it that's what God wants
[42:12] it's not a halfway but an absolute full
[42:14] surrender to the kingdom of God that's
[42:16] exactly what God wants that's right can
[42:19] I go a little further yeah all right
[42:21] brother brandom says I love this he said
[42:23] Abraham threw Isaac's head back and took
[42:26] his hair aside and he said he took the
[42:28] knife and raised it in his heart choking
[42:30] back tears as if to say forever farewell
[42:33] Isaac my boy you got a hand it to Isaac
[42:36] right I mean you got a hand it to him
[42:38] raise his hand in full obedience and
[42:41] even
[42:43] watch even if you're doing something
[42:46] wrong and walking in
[42:48] obedience the Holy Ghost is there to
[42:51] stop you if you got the real thing the
[42:53] Holy Ghost is there to stop you don't
[42:56] worry he said if it's the Holy Ghost he
[42:58] will know when to stop you and when to
[43:00] start you that's right he's got the
[43:02] button in his
[43:04] hand Hallelujah somebody's got a button
[43:07] that helps me to refrain from doing the
[43:10] stupid somebody's got a button that that
[43:12] helps me to to be checked when I'm doing
[43:15] something wrong thank God for the button
[43:17] and thank God it's not in my hand but
[43:19] it's in his hand thank God for that kind
[43:22] of an experience that makes God so
[43:24] personally interested in you and he's
[43:26] going to actually turn you around when
[43:29] you need to be turned around yes sir
[43:31] glory to God everybody all right all
[43:33] right so therefore we need we need to
[43:36] make sure that we watch and we be sober
[43:39] that word sober is a great thing that
[43:42] word sober is a tremendous
[43:44] thing and we need to make sure that we
[43:46] are sober because there's going to be
[43:48] times when you're called upon to act in
[43:50] a certain way and you're not going to
[43:51] have a whole lot of prayer time to
[43:53] consider it there's going to be things
[43:55] that you're confronting with that you're
[43:56] going to have to act fast and you don't
[43:59] want to have to go somewhere to get
[44:00] prayed up you ought to live in the
[44:02] spirit and walk in the spirit tomorrow
[44:05] we'll take a little bit of time to put
[44:06] some flesh on that as to what it
[44:08] actually looks like in dayto day but
[44:10] you're not going to have time in certain
[44:11] instances uh to make a whole lot of
[44:13] decision or to uh you know to change a
[44:16] lot that's around you so let me close
[44:18] with this story Matt you be
[44:20] ready let me close with this story some
[44:23] of you I know have heard it before back
[44:25] in World War II Hitler began to have air
[44:28] superiority he began to win this
[44:30] struggle in World War II by bombing the
[44:32] guts out of London everybody was afraid
[44:35] Churchill knew the only way I'm going to
[44:37] win this struggle is to develop my own
[44:39] Air Force right that was the story in
[44:41] World War I they knew that whoever had
[44:43] air superiority they were the ones that
[44:45] were going to win this battle and
[44:48] Churchill knew that so they developed
[44:49] planes one of the planes that developed
[44:51] quickly was called a Spitfire Spitfire
[44:53] was fast light but it could carry a
[44:55] fairly good payload so they can get in
[44:57] quick drop a bomb on a factory in
[44:59] Germany fly back and make it so they
[45:01] developed the Spitfire it was a powerful
[45:03] weapon in the hands of the British uh
[45:06] VF and one day a test pilot was up test
[45:11] flying the
[45:12] Spitfire and back in those days when
[45:14] they built the Prototype there was
[45:16] nothing in it except wires and cables
[45:18] and levers and a seat that's all there
[45:21] was there was no uh nothing finished
[45:23] inside it was all open and the p
[45:25] testified were're crazy and they still
[45:27] are they testified brought it up brought
[45:30] it down landed okay they said adjust
[45:32] this and that bring it up again bring it
[45:33] down bring it up bring it down bring it
[45:35] up bring it down and they test flew
[45:37] these uh prototype planes many times in
[45:40] order to uh see how it was acting and
[45:43] what adjustments they needed to make all
[45:45] right so one day this test pilot is up
[45:48] there he's up pretty high and he's
[45:50] looking around and everything's going
[45:51] okay and he's just kind of doing this
[45:53] number he's
[45:54] cruising and he looks around and he
[45:58] sees a
[46:00] rat you thought I was going to say an
[46:02] eagle right cuz we the message no but he
[46:04] didn't he saw a
[46:06] wrap he looked back and he saw this
[46:09] rrap back there chewing on a hydraulic
[46:12] cable the hydraulic cable control the
[46:15] pitch and yaw the plane so therefore the
[46:17] pilot could go this way and this way but
[46:18] he couldn't go this way and this way
[46:21] that's bad news for a pile and he knew
[46:24] that he knew that if that rra was
[46:26] successful and chewed through the rubber
[46:28] all that hydraulic fluid would leak out
[46:30] and he would have to crash slam the
[46:32] plane now he's only he's only by himself
[46:35] he doesn't have anybody to uh you know
[46:37] say hey go down and get that rat and he
[46:39] doesn't have time to go down and get the
[46:41] rat himself because he doesn't have
[46:42] autopilot and number two if if he goes
[46:45] and gets the rat what if the rat runs
[46:46] away now he's chasing this rat around I
[46:49] mean you can imagine how silly that
[46:50] would look right so he's looking at this
[46:52] rap and he realizes whoa that's when you
[46:55] say wo everybody say wo I mean that's wo
[47:01] what in the world I do now and he's got
[47:03] this graap back there and he's just
[47:05] gnawing away in the Rubber and uh going
[47:07] to town and so he makes a decision
[47:09] really fast you know what he does he
[47:12] reaches over and takes his oxygen mask
[47:14] and puts it on and he takes the plane
[47:16] and he points it almost vertically and
[47:19] he goes straight up and as he goes
[47:22] straight up the oxygen thins in the
[47:24] plane and that rat back there he's watch
[47:27] he's got his eye on the rat he's
[47:28] watching that rat and that rat just kind
[47:30] of
[47:32] goes Falls over I do that for you but it
[47:35] take too long to get
[47:38] out and the rat Falls over dead because
[47:41] he's deprived of
[47:42] oxygen and the pilot takes the plane
[47:46] after he flies at that altitude for a
[47:48] while he takes that plane and he comes
[47:49] down and the levels off and the raft
[47:51] doesn't move and he knows he's defeated
[47:52] his enemy let me leave you with this
[47:54] simple thought and that is this when you
[47:56] get into a place where the pressure is
[47:57] on when you get into a place where all
[48:00] of a sudden Satan's hand is heavy or you
[48:02] got doubts go higher don't go lower go
[48:05] higher go into his presence go closer to
[48:08] his presence don't go low every one of
[48:10] you will have rats that show up
[48:11] unexpectedly and I'm telling you this
[48:13] don't go lower go higher when you get
[48:15] into a spot like that go higher because
[48:18] that's the safest place you can go
[48:21] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[48:22] the real thing you would not have sent
[48:24] us some faith
[48:26] impersonation in this last day but Lord
[48:29] you've given us the real thing father
[48:31] may we have a heart like David
[48:32] Livingston that said I'll go anywhere as
[48:34] long as you go with me Lord may we all
[48:37] sever the ties that keep us Lord from
[48:40] representing the kingdom of God lord May
[48:43] everyone here leave with a real thing I
[48:46] commit the people and this day in your
[48:49] hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[48:52] amen
