this morning amen want to go into the word and something the lord has laid on my heart i was able to finish up my lengthy series last sunday and so i was able to kind of break a little new ground this morning i want to speak about god's goal god's goal that is purposed in christ amen so um isaiah chapter four i don't have any other announcements to make but let's just catch our text and then we'll re pray and let you be seated amen greetings to our visitors here with us this morning god bless you happy to have you amen isaiah 4 and verse 1 through 5 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night and upon all the glory shall be a defense isn't that beautiful amen praise the lord let's read that sixth verse and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat and for a place of refuge and from a covert from storm and from rain let's pray father we commit ourselves now lord to the reading of the word and i just step aside lord as i'm just here to assist you that's all i am they sang i was invited forward now i've only followed you up here and i'm just your assistant father so i commit myself into your hands master believing that you will feed your people i have such a confidence because you have proven so reliable to do that so we commit it now to you in jesus name lord we remember our families who are out traveling not with us today and we remember our sick lord who are afflicted and we're remembering particularly this morning our dear brother joe lord and and uh brother mark there with him lord streaming the service may the anointing fall upon them today lord may our brother just complete lord this is a time father for rest and restoration so may you restore him completely now lord and may he just lean back on you and rest as brother abraham myra teaches us we rest in the hands of jehovah we can rest lord because you are in control of it all so we commit it to you now and commit the reading the hearing of the word the ministering of the gospel into your hands in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated i guess this must have gotten red acquire practice directly after surface okay very good so i i desired today to take this thought and and if possible then i would also like to give it a subtitle of a great love story and i believe that the plan of redemption is no doubt the greatest love story ever written and it's not just written it's it's not a novel it's a happening and it's been happening for millennia so we look to the lord now and we want you to just consider these passages that we've read i just want to make sure i'm all in order here so brother branham would first address this prophecy that we found in verse 1 and in that day so we needed a prophet to identify to us what day that would be now that's not this is not to dismiss that it had an application in the days of israel in the old testament uh but but even even almost all scholars agree that this is really forecasting uh the tribulation period when when we're at the end and god is going to finally not only purge israel he's going to he's going to purge the whole world and those that survive and who are left in zion and in jerusalem they will be the uh the holy of the lord they will be redeemed i i'm glad that i count myself in that number that i'm i i battle here and i battle constantly that my life can be holy i'm glad that on that day the battle will be over hallelujah it's a fight that i'm all too happy to fight and i intend to keep fighting it i don't intend to back up backslide go backwards i intend to go forwards and every day and if i stumble i'll get up i'll repent i'll dust myself off and i'll pick up my sword and i'll go forward again i'll never stop never stop satan needs to get that i will never stop fighting and so brother branham addresses this the first time that i could find in 1954 this prophecy he's asked the question brother branham can you interpret this is in 1954 questions and answers can you interpret this passage in isaiah 4. and so this of course is nearly two full years to the day almost almost to the day before america would cross the separating line between mercy and judgment and brother branham would would indicate that this was a prophecy concerning the day and hour that was right now and he was saying this prophecy is already coming to pass and it's going to continue to come to pass and he cites the immorality of women particularly um and and he puts that forward as evidence since the time of the first woe in the book of revelation which we know to be world war one and brother branham simply goes back to statistically and says notice that uh that that their that the stats show that gis who came home from that beginning at that war and also happened again in the second woe of world war ii that they they got all these dear john letters and they they came home to find out they were divorced and their wives were with other men who had not gone to war and so brother branham talks about how that you know ever since that time the fall the the thing that broke the back of the nation was the fall of motherhood because you know we had you know rosie the riveter you know during these world wars and let's lead all the women into the workforce and you know and and i mean it's just it in one way humanly speaking it made some sense somebody needed to man the factories and most of the men were at war but you understand that that it was it was the devil using the curse of sin to take advantage and bring and bring down the ruination of this nation and he certainly was successful and we find that from that from that hour divorce rates spiked and have continued to rise to their highest levels in history and until finally you know during the uh you know the the social upheaval and the sexual revolution of the 1960s people just stopped getting married and they just started shacking up and living together and and the citizens of this nation you can see it happening from the time of the first woe particularly you can see that the the citizens of this nation you know have been constantly since that day reaching forever increasing levels of filth and the general degradation of humanity the world over friends i mean that i'm not making this up history shows this to be true you know it was already very pervasive in 1954. i was my wife and i we were fueling up the truck yesterday not just having it fueled for the weekend and and i i'm pulling in you know to what i have the right to do i've got a right to pull my truck into a gas pump and get out and not be assaulted and and i'm not talking about physically i can't even get to the gas pump and there is a young woman so vulgar dressed so vulgar i i have to keep my head down where's my door handle let me not look where's my where's my gas lever and and she's just parading around like she owns the place i'm here to tell you that's that's the curse of sin see it's already pervasive in the world and and and and it's and it's everywhere and you know here we have to fight this fight constantly and it's it's it's been an ever increasing thing since that time in 1954 since the first woes of 1918 and and even before and after that you find that that that's why you when you look at the book of revelation and you see compound meanings where you remember out of the bottomless pit rolled locusts with with hair like women with stings in their tail and they tormented the and brother branham said they tormented they were sent to torment the women who had cut their hair off and so you have a you have actually and i don't not teaching on this today that is certainly got a future fulfillment of a full magnet a full manifestation and tribulation but parts of that were coming under the first woe because that was the torment that's when bobbed hair started bobbed hair that even that term the bob started right there just before the outbreak of the first woe and so now what it what what are the women doing now they're paying a price they're being tormented because now under the judgments of the first woe their sons and their husbands and their dads are being slaughtered on the battlefield so you you can see all of these various multiple applications and various layers that are being fulfilled already have been in fulfillment and are continuing to unfold don't don't put everything off to the tribulation period friends the judgments of god are already falling brother branham that's thus saith the lord since 1964 in the alaska earthquake the judgments begin pre-tribulation and won't let up and only are getting worse into the tribulation and then worse is an understatement you don't want to be here trust me i don't plan to be how about you so since that time and every day forward man has come up with new and inventive ways of sinning i heard brother matt speaking about it this morning those things from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and and and and how that brother branham then speaks to it again as i can find the next time in 1963 shortly after the opening of the seals he takes this this prophecy again in the flashing red light of the sign of his coming and in this passage brother branham doubles down on his interpretation and describes the gentile world now fully returned again to the days of noah and the days of lot and he's doubling down on that prophecy in 4-1 and he mentions that and he starts talking about the evidence of it is that we see the same things happening in the days of noah and that happened in the days of sodom and now we have a convergence and you're fighting it on two fronts see and then and then lastly as i can find um he mentions it again in 1964 the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride wherein he confirms that his worst fears have come to pass that the nation and the world are indeed doomed they cannot be saved that uh they're they're they're they're on a certain irreversible irrevocable path to destruction and no one's coming to save them or stop it and and and it's it's man is largely doing it to himself it's it was all to happen just before so brother branham now has this scripture seven women shall take a hold of one man and he's showing consistently prior to the seals prior to the nation crossing the line after the seals and he's showing that it was all happening just before the greatest moment in human history when god would finish this thing i'm glad he would take an elected bride elected gentile bride and and an elected jewish remnant and start a whole new oh millennium of peace and righteousness oh my what an hour that's going to be but of course now so this prophecy is also descriptive of israel just before her renewal the millennium which of course in the millennium will be a permanent renewal so the prophecy deals with that four thousand years for israel four thousand years of on again off again blessing and punishing will be over four thousand years of on again off again trials and tribulations it'll all be ended in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious look up friends your future is bright amen in the gospel transformation study notes the author picks this up and he says this one whose name is the branch will build the temple of the lord you know you can read that in zechariah 6 and that's very very clear he said he will build the temple of the lord and as such he will bring renewal and shalom to the land and i just thought about that term shalom to the land and i just thought with thousands of recent hamas rockets i think they said above 4 000 recent hamas rockets raining down on it and seemingly all the world turning against it even america even american jews then i i doubt this little track of promised land has ever appeared so the opposite of shalom to the land he goes on to say the result will be a changed people they will be holy for god shall have washed away their filth when god comes now listen as i found such affinity i so agreed with this statement when god comes and rescues how many have been rescued by him amen see if you haven't been rescued by him then you're doomed because you can't save yourself only he can save you and so he says when god comes and rescues now catch it i hope you agree i hope i'll get an amen he does not leave us as we are but purifies us and changes our lives don't call yourself a christian unless you have the life of christ living inside you see this grace of god finds full expression the author says in the work of christ and his spirit makes us new creatures his life living in and through us accomplishing our sanctification so god has rescued this bride today he has called you out of a doomed system called you out of doomed politics doomed ecumenical systems doomed social circles he's called you out of doomed uh of doomed entertainments and doomed recreation he's called you to life and to liberty and so i would say have liberty and the life that he gives see it literally produced a bride who in this hour is we understand that she's invisibly united with with the crucified and the risen lord jesus brother branham describes this prominently in the message all through the message he talks about that in that union that that oneness with christ and until he he can't even he can't hold it back anymore and finally he's got to preach a whole sermon called the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the invisible union of the heavenly brigand and bride of christ the invisible union friends it was a message that god placed on his heart he wished it you know brother branham said i wish it was someone else's message to give people think that that the prophet took pleasure in in messages like the indictment and and god of the civil age or satan's eden and and uh you know i remember i remember one time i was working on a job and we were painting house dad and i and we used to always have to get there early quickly we had to beat the carpenters because they would always get there with their radios and they'd be playing hank williams or they'd be playing you know ac dc or whoever depends on what crew was there and so i would always get there really quick and get our big tape recorder out and put on brother branham so it'd be blasting everywhere and made them listen to preaching all day it was funny hey man i was just big enough they didn't try to defy me and so uh i remember one day i was in a working in the garage and the homeowner showed up she wanted to show she had her her friends with her to show the new remodel in the house and oh man i had brother branham i think i was playing something like satan's eden and he was just giving them the what for these women you women you know you bob of your hair you wear these tight clothes and hey you don't call yourself a christian you're not even a lady and you know he goes all back and forth and he's just letting them have it and and those women are kind of walking around looking in the garage and he's right there blasting them and i'm on the outside painting and i'm thinking brother brandon made me run off this job you may be run over this job and uh finally you know they they won't even they won't even look it's right there just cooking them and they're kind of going well maybe we should just move on and they kind of walked on in what are y'all staring at it's right there oh my what a day that was i remember that so clear but we didn't get fired we got to finish the job and we got paid amen and so uh and i wasn't uh though the worst brother eddie would take uh the van speaker and set it out on the window and just point it right at the house so you know i it was those were wonderful days but um but brother branham you know he he would say that he would say you know god he said i don't mean to offend people i'm not trying to be different this is a man who loved people and wanted unity and he said you know but god has given me a message and i must be honest and he said i wish it wasn't mine to give i wish somebody else had this burden see paul describes it see in in galatians 2 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me this is the invisible union you get me galatians 2 20 is the invisible union i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live not not in not in the faith but by the faith not in the son of god but the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me i don't just have faith in him i have his faith i'm invisibly united and that's why when a message came in this day i'm sorry but it couldn't hold back it couldn't fail to declare and it could not shun to declare the whole council of god because this invisible union had to be restored i'm glad for a faithful messenger because i got restored and i'm invisibly united back with it again that's why i'm an oddball to the world that's why i don't fit if the opposite of that is true that's maybe why you do fit amen amen but if that's true that's why you don't fit all right so isaiah then is making it clear that god would bring what he determined for his chosen people to completion in the future god shall redeem israel friends i'm here to tell you we look for the rapture of the bride of christ but understand that you're an event on the way to an event that he's coming back for benjamin but he can't get the benjamin with you in the way so just like i've showed you about the the golf pro and i forget wherever who it was fuzzy zeller or palmer one of those guys okay somebody who could drive might have been jack who could drive it really long one of the old guys and they asked him said how do you drive the ball so far it's almost unheard of how do you do that he said because i'm not trying to drive the ball far he said i'm only trying to get a perfect swing the ball's just in the way he said so the ball's in my path of my perfect swing i'm telling you he's swinging for benjamin you're in the way you're in the path i just say swing away lord knock me right on out of here hallelujah i'm ready i'm ready to get on with the millennium friends i i you know my wife and i were talking about it yesterday i don't i'm not still not looking for a shortcut i don't want to leave with my job half done i that's that's not that i was taught better as a work ethic by my dad than that it doesn't matter it might be quitting time normally but we're so close to being done we're gonna stay and finish this thing i'm not coming back tomorrow for a little bitty 20 30 minute finish up we're gonna stay mom sorry we're gonna be late for supper i i i want to be there but i i don't want to leave here till i'm done till i'm finished hallelujah and i believe we got more to do friends and we need to be up and at it we need to be about the father's business amen he's going to redeem israel and i believe that's going to be soon the will we find that the winds of war and winds of judgment have already begun a century ago under the first world wars and so we find here that you know among the gentile i mean just look at what has transpired in in history it's already history parts you know there's not a there's not i can't even find a bible teacher old or current that that that teaches anything other than the four horsemen of the of the book of revelation in chapter 6 are future for the tribulation and they're completely oblivious to that the first three have already happened and they're already history amen and they're oblivious to the fact that it's all the same writer and that the last pale one is the conglomeration of all the previous three and they don't realize that it's already brought them to their knees right in the churches until they have completely crucified for the second time christ the word and they've already been indicted amen there's already been a second crucifixion there's already been an indictment and the judgments have already begun to fall starting with a good friday earthquake paralleling matthew 27 flawlessly and the world must get worse and worse i'm not i'm not here today preaching a message of doom i'm preaching about god's goal that he purposed in christ i'm here preaching a love story amen so we find that the world must get worse and worse till jesus comes and takes it all back and i'll just ask you a question if the world is doomed and headed for a certain destruction and it's only getting worse and can't get better and must get worse and then jesus comes down and rescues you out of it that's not the greatest love story that you've ever heard i mean it's it's one thing if i got a fire in the fireplace and a fireman breaks in to drag me out of the house what are you doing but if my whole house is engulfed and i'm unconscious and he's dragging me out this man is important to me from going forward you see so we find that we're living in it now it's all happening around us in real time humanity has certainly lived out the words that brother branham said we're living right now in the fulfillment of things that he said like never before how the whole world would go insane we're there how it wouldn't even be safe i mean if you don't have the holy ghost friends it's not even you're not safe to walk down the street without a firearm see and and and and and then it's it the whole world has upside down and it's changed all of its laws and that and that's what the beast system was supposed to do see and so we find that the promise of christ is among us again with the full word which is such a comfort to me it's such a comfort to me to hear a prophet say we're only ripening we're only scouring for that last seed i'm not looking for another revival i'm looking for the coming of the lord that is so comforting to me i can face today and i can face however many more tomorrows there might be if there needs to be but but i can tell you friend that my sense of scale and my sense of comparison to prophecy tell me that it won't be long now i'm here to tell you it can't be long now what does your spiritual senses tell you see i'm not talking about your knowledge you better look deeper than that you better look deeper into your spiritual senses you know look look at the current level of your spiritual life let that be your barometer amen come on take some honest introspection today paul said let a man examine himself see when you come to the house of the lord and that'll tell you who you know and where more importantly where you really are and you know i i regret to have to say that some need their whole life awakened from a spiritual slumber you know you should pray that god grant it to you amen you should pray that god granted i spend time i spend time praying that he will grant it to you i spend time praying that he'll grant it to your families and to your children will you help me pray for you will you help me pray for you how i'd love to have somebody walk up to me after today maybe days to come and say brother jason i went home and i opened up my old prayer closet again and i'm helping you pray for me and i'm helping you pray for my children hallelujah oh i need your help friends i can't get us there all by myself i'm i'm fighting hard to this is an age where we need a full court press this is an age where we need all hands on deck everybody manning their battle stations everybody man your weapons today come on preachers deacons officers laity parents grandparents teenagers man your battle stations the war is on and we're right near the finish line friends hallelujah we're almost home isaiah's words assure that israel's destiny would be glorious the author finishes here in spite of intervening judgment you see joseph loved benjamin i mean he loved all of his brother they were his half brothers but benjamin was his full-blooded brother and his bowels his bowels mean his yearnings his his deepest feelings see and so he loved benjamin and you know god loved his gentile bride christ loved his gentile bride joseph loved his gentile bride that had been given to him by the king of egypt the pharaoh see and you know and so the bible tells us that those who were not his people became his people and were made his bride and i just thought about that i just thought wow was there ever was there ever a greater love story than this i mean ever ever a greater love story told among men can you think of a greater love story ever told among men than when god laid aside his crown laid aside the creator of the world and the universe laid aside everything and took upon him the form of a man and he absorbed every sin you've ever committed he absorbed every sin you would ever commit oh my a life that no one could take from him he freely did that they couldn't force him to do it you understand he freely did that was there ever a greater love story was there ever a greater love was there ever a greater lover than jesus christ was there ever a greater hero in any story any story you've read have you ever read a greater hero than this you should think about it friends he came at the price of blood he saved you at the cost of his own life think about that next time the devil tells you he's your buddy satan can't die for you wouldn't do him any good he wouldn't do it anyhow remember he wouldn't even redeem uh uh ruth wouldn't redeem her it would imperil his own heritage i'm glad that she got redeemed i'm glad boaz was there but he saved you at the cost of his own life his own creation would sell him out this is part of the love story this is part of the greatest story ever told his own creation his masterpiece would betray him the very work of his hands that turned on him david speaks about it i don't have time to get going down that line today you know his even even in the days of his human incarnation and the 70 left him well you know the 12 stayed with him and one of them was the devil and then that devil finally betrayed him in the garden of gethsemane you know and and the the 11 had stayed with him promised that they would stay with him forever but when it came to skin they all fled some of them jumped out of their clothes getting away ran off in the night half naked see peter followed him hurt his trial could see and hear that he was being falsely accused that witnesses were lying these witnesses were lying peter knew them you're lying he knew this was a religious kangaroo court he he he he i mean he he should have done he could have made some kind of move to defend him you know it it it i i i i'm so glad that that's why brother branham comes in this day and preaches a message called the trial and he says tonight i'm gonna give my lord a fair trial he didn't get a fair trial when he was here 2000 years ago tonight i'm going to give him a fair trial hallelujah that's the very series of meetings my dad was in a prayer line got my of my divine healing of an incurable disease during that series there in birmingham says i'm going to give my lord tonight a fair trial because he didn't get a fair trial you know what i found out at the end of that trial you know what i found well you know what you found out at the end of that trial he was innocent you know what we found out we were guilty he was innocent and he gave his life god traded the innocent for the guilty tell me that's not the greatest love story you ever heard tell me this one isn't worth serving and worth your life peter could have made a move my goodness he didn't defend him at all i mean gee he he could have it he could have at least organized a protest and organized marches and carried signs i mean he didn't even whisper around start a rumor mill he should have done anything but stand there and let it happen he he cursed and swore he didn't even know him you see every servant of god has failed him from the least to the greatest they've all failed him somewhere but oh my i'm here to tell you in jesus god had a servant that wouldn't fail him i'm so glad for election i'm so glad for election today oh he gave his life so that he could send it back upon his church and live inside of his people and seal them into safety until the day of your redemption imagine that lucky you you're sealed into safety until the day of your redemption and you won't you won't you won't give god make him the center of your life and you won't get him make him first you want to make him second and third and brother branham let me tell you william branham who knew him very well talked to him a lot he said he don't want to be second he don't want to be second he don't want to be jesus don't want to be second he paid too high a price for you to do him that way he wants to be first in your life what did the world do with the holy ghost that god sent them in the new testament isaiah says it right here seven women see here's all down through seven church ages a woman represents the church all down through seven women shall take a hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach you okay still with me only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach seven women you know who seven church ages of humanity seven church ages of people who merely wanted his name but not a relationship amen i'd like to be called a christian in some circles it's vogue i'd like to be called i'm born again see they wanted to take his name but not really a relationship seven church ages that only wanted his blessing but never never willing to bring forth his seed that's that's why you have this this wasn't made this to stay this this will be finished someday and brother branham said when it's closed the last time why because this will be flesh this came like this to become this you understand this didn't he didn't give you this for memorization it's not a memory drill this came to live this is a seed this is impregnated with life if you feed on it and believe it and surrender to it you'll start being like this hallelujah that's why the message of the arcane that's why we have an invisible union that's why you're a believer that's why you're a christian and believe the message of the hour see don't be one who just wants his name only amen you're not supposed to take the name of the lord in vain you're not supposed to do that don't want his name only matt give me exodus 20 verse uh 7 down through 11 i think probably somewhere around in there thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain now we're not just talking about sailor talk you get me not talking about you know cussing i'm talking about saying seven women taking a hold of one man and saying just give me your name i don't want a relationship i just want to be i just want to be named i don't want to bring forth your seed i don't want my life to be like your life i just want your name there's a there's social advantage i want to go to the mega church i want to i want to have my kids in their program i want to be part of that they got a nice food pantry they got a nice choir they got a nice televangelism they got it all over the world no no no no i'm not interested please give me somebody with itching ears i'll heap to myself teachers who just tell me what i want to hear don't really tell me what this says but thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that take his name in vain you remember in the in the ephesian age that the false church said they were the church they were the ecclesia god said okay fine if you're going to say that you're the church then i'm going to hold you responsible to be the church remember when jesus was there in the temple and they and he's telling about dead men's bones and men walk over you and they don't realize they're walking over graves and and these i don't remember if it's lawyers or pharisees or who it was and they said are are we dead also and jesus says well said that you know i'll just give it to you in in in in easy language you know if you actually were you know if you if you actually were just in ignorance then you you'd have some kind of excuse to give god at least you could at least plead ignorance but since you say we see your guilt remains because you may you take the name of the lord and you take it in vain you're not supposed to do that seven women shall take a hold of one man at the end time at the end of seven ages that's been happening for two thousand years and it was it's come to full fruition in this hour listen friends don't don't lose that that's why we've had 266 popes that's why there's 1.2 billion roman catholics that's why there's 2 billion protestants that's why there's a staggering global 45 000 denominations why because through seven ages they only took his name and never wanted to bring forth his life but you're not supposed to take the name of the lord thy god in vain verse 8 son remember the sabbath day what is the sabbath day the holy ghost remember don't take the name of the lord in vain because the holy ghost is a sabbath it's a rest it's a holy day it's a holy thing you don't just take my name you become you allow me to it to to impregnate you with my seed so that you can bring forth a child like mary did you bring forth his life living through your life don't take the name of the lord thy god in vain i give it to you in kentucky language if you're not going to live like a christian said a kentucky prophet stop calling yourself a christian because you only bring a reproach i tell you something friends that is against every fiber of my being to try to claim i'm something that i'm not i'd rather just go out and eat drink and be merry for tomorrow i die i'm not here to be a fake christian or a fake believer i'm not here to be an underachiever that grinds on me more than any other weakness in my life is to underachieve and i say lord god forgive me i pray it daily help me to let let this day be a more success than the day before let me charge for it let me be more i want to be more not just do more remember i want to be more verse 9 six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work see so so so i leave it right there so i i hope you're hearing the voice of god today i don't talk about my voice i'm not talking about it on a screen i'm talking about in your soul today i hope you're hearing the voice of god you know hear the lord calling to you from his word today and he's saying to you you have a life see in in in view of verse 9 6 days thou shalt labor the lord gives you a life he gives you a life you understand you have a life and you are to live in this world but you aren't given this life to abuse it in this world as paul taught us you don't abuse it you're here you can't get out of here you can't escape it paul had wrote to them in his first letter you know you need to be separate from the world and they wrote him back paul gee how do we i mean we have jobs and careers we're in school we have families we're in the market what do you mean well you want us to build a community paul says no no he writes back in the second letter and clears it no i didn't mean that because in order to in order to be completely separate you just have to go out of the world because no matter where you go you go out and live with the indians there's bad indians live in the wilderness there's still demons out there you understand so he's saying i didn't mean you know you'd have to leave the world but what i'm saying to you is you do live here but understand you're not from here you're in the world you're not of the world see you you have life in the world six days thou shalt labor i give it to you and do all thy work so in other words have your life but but don't forget that you're you're called to a rest also you're not just here for your life do you hear his voice calling to you today see son daughter don't you know that you're the temple of my dwelling place i'm in here too so don't live your whole life just with your six days of life there's a sabbath there's another day there's a there's a holy ghost that you should live by see i hope you hear his voice calling today i gave you six days you can't give me one amen i give you six days you can't give me one one i mean some people can't even give him one out of six days to come to church they don't give him one out of six and he gives them everything all good things and gifts come down from the father above in whom is no variableness no shadow of turning all good gifts come down from him any good gift you've got in your life he gave you and he says i give you life and i give you blessing and i give you six days to live i give you you know almost you know but hey i i live in there too see don't you know that that i'm in you because i you're my temple so that i can have an expression through you that's why i'm in you don't take my name in vain i'm here for a reason there's a sabbath there's a rest there's a holy ghost see verse 10. but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work so don't make your life about only your life don't take the name of the lord in vain don't make your life only about your life the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work see thou nor thy son nor thy daughter so don't don't run your family in a way that does that don't teach that to your children by your way of living like that because you're training them that life's about this life and life's not about this life life's about the next one coming hallelujah amen oh come on don't get quiet on me friends just because we turned a little bit inward you know see thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle so even your business and all your blessings that come down to you from above they should openly this is what god is saying your life and your business and your family and everything that has to do with living it should bring me glory and his people should recognize my presence inside you amen and when you live in a way that doesn't bring me glory and people don't know my presence is there and i'm just sitting in there twiddling my thumbs because you won't give me expression amen say amen oh my old me something god is saying that to you today friends i hope you're catching it i'm the god who gives you these things i'm the god who makes you successful amen i'm the god who saved you from doom i'm the god who rescued you i'm the god who's going to make you beautiful in the world to come see so he says thy thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle i mean friends even the saints of god's family who are who are so journeying here with you struggling struggling along with you are we all in this together and we're all struggling this together even they should be able to find in you are refreshing amen amen oh lord i'm about to switch gears everybody locking up on me they should be able to find a refreshing this is this is part of why we assembled this part of why we open the doors see you're hearing a trumpet sound when those doors open it's not about a church schedule you're hearing a trumpet sound you're being called to the master's table you're being called to a feast this is a feast day a feast day see i give you six days but i have a seventh and that's a sabbath hallelujah oh my it's a spiritual feast it's a holy convocation this is why paul says in first corinthians 5. beginning verse 7 christ our passover is sacrificed for us verse 8 therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth see so thy manservant a maid servant i cattle nor nor the last part of verse 10 back in exodus 20 last part of verse 10 nor thy stranger that is within thy gates see so so your public testimony should reflect his presence in your life listen this is to the old and young married or single teenagers parents grandparents officers preachers your your your your everything should be done so that it brings him glory so that people see your public testimony that your public testimony declares his presence in your life not not merely teaching not merely doctrine that don't win no body but his presence should is what should be recognized in your life verse 11 for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all and all that in them is everybody say all and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it see so we don't we don't take his name vainly that's not why he saved you this is the greatest love story ever told we're living in a world that betrayed him and even every servant betrayed him yet he you know he he made a promise through david and david fell horribly it jesus still came the promise still happened see i'm that's why paul said nothing can separate me from the love of god not heighten or death nor apparel famine sword anything not even me can separate me see so how many are willing today to help me pray for you help me pray for your children help me pray for your business help me pray we're trying to get us all home friends and this you're living in the hour of the culmination the complete zenith the complete apex of that prophecy at the end of seven ages you've got a pale horse rider ready to ride you've got a flying eagle anointing anointing a bride anointing a bride to do what shalom anointing a bride to be invisibly united with christ anointing a bride so that her life so that his life in her life can live out through her life is that the desire of your heart see that's that was his desire when he you remember brother branham tells one of the i'm going to close with this you and it's familiar to you i won't even bother reading the quotes on it but brother branham tells the story of the rancher member the armor packing and the son who went out west and he left the east because he he couldn't find anything but fake women and he wanted to go out to the prairies and find him a uh a wilderness girl who was and brother branham said he wanted to find a real a real woman see he wanted brother brandon talks about how that you know he he comes out there i love reading that story man because it's so romantic and it's so adventuresome and it's so you know and how that you remember how that he he noticed her and she didn't know he was watching and she was like cinderella you know all she all the evil stepsisters had made her the slave remember she was a cousin and uh and all those other ones remember all the other cousins and they were brother graham said they were all trying to vamp him and they were all trying to you know impress him through you know tight-fitting clothes and and too much cleavage and a lot a ton of makeup and but he had already seen that he didn't want that that's why he was there he wanted he wanted a holy girl he wanted somebody pure who would be a real mother a real mother to his children a real wife who would who would wipe away his sorrows when he'd come in from work a mother a wife who could sit him down and and take every and here he comes and he's got a as brother beckett would say you know man he goes into the world and he's working and he's contacting spirits and he this devil and this devil and this devil he said how wonderful is it to be able to come home and have a wife in her position to be able to take every spirit under her control for the glory of god and just clean his mind and clean his spirit and fix him and love him and be tender to him oh there's nothing that'll that'll help a man be a christian more than that don't lose sight of that ladies in this 21st century i i know it puts you out there i get it oh my pray for you constantly i understand bills and children have to be fed i get that i understand that totally i'm not preaching against that today but just understand your place and your position you're the bride you're the wife of christ amen and he brother bram said he he was watching and he kept he was what he was doing was he was scouting he was he was you know like like a terrorist who watch a building and he's watching every way she goes every day at this time she goes right here he said so the next night he's there waiting on me standing in the darkness and here she comes with the water and all of a sudden he just steps out into the light good evening oh my brother brown said she quickly she's barefooted she's in rags she looks down she won't look up and he says i've been noticing you and he says listen i'm just going to cut it to you straight he said i back east he said i come out here looking for a wife he said i've seen all the kind of women of this world he said i'm not interested in that he said uh he said you fit exactly what i'm looking for you're exactly what i'm looking for and brother brown says she's he says will you marry me and she says well of course i will but i'm not worthy and he said you're exactly i know you think you're not worthy but you're exactly what i'm looking for you're right you're exactly what i'm looking for don't think you're unworthy you're the very thing i've dreamed that i could come out here and find and here you are oh my friends oh i'm going to get beside myself and preach another hour if i'm not if i'm not careful but brother branham says i'll just give you this one she met all the requirements that he had ever been looking for see ya so what's it all about friends let me come back full circle let me let me come back full circle to where i started verse 2 isaiah 4 verse 2 and 3. here is god's goal that was purposed in christ in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem this is the eternal aim of god in all of it so i'm finishing where i started today i'm coming back full circle this is god's goal to bring you to something where brother brown said someday you you're here you hear the preaching you're hearing the service you feel the anointing god blesses your life something good happens you get a little taste he said you think it's so good he said someday he and that word will become what you never dreamed possible that's what we're headed for friends that's why i serve it because it's a living gospel let's stand brother matt bring your t i'm sorry brother bradley bring your team back amen this morning praise the lord amen wow that's thank god i feel completed praise the lord i actually had another sermon i wanted to preach i was driving this morning telling my wife i said i'm really looking forward to my material today but boy do i wish i could preach something different she's like wait what what what and i said well i'm gonna enjoy this i've been working on it i said but wow i've got another thought burning on my heart but i pledged the lord many years ago when i just uh just started not ministering i'd never do that i'd never pick and choose what to preach i would always go with what he told me and never position it to where i thought that you know i want to is what i want to preach no and i've never broke that never knowingly but jack my whole life never knowingly since the day i started very early i was preaching a year or two and uh and i had one of those situations where you hear me talk about how well i was coming to remember church i i'll say i was coming to church i had a sermon i got hijacked on the way and so we're going to preach something different today this is one of those the first time that ever happened to me and thank goodness it don't happen often because it's unnerving and i was i wasn't even at my home church yeah i was at i was at uh i was in colombia and i was at benny perry's church first time i'd ever preached i've been preaching maybe a year and i was in the back and they were getting ready to call me out and i had my had my sunday morning notes my sunday night notes ready to go and i'm just ready to walk out the door and the lord says you're going to flip that and i said flip what you're going to preach sunday nights this morning and this morning's tonight and i almost didn't do it and i just said lord ah you know for me it's all about preparation and but then i remembered i could hear it playing in my head i'm gonna hear it tell you something friends let me give a piece of advice this has served me there are several statements that i i've been listening to tapes since uh like my earliest memory as a little child my mom wore out multiple reel-to-reel recorders the whole neighborhood got to hear brother brandon she played them around as soon as one would stop she'd thread through another and wind it up and the way we would go and and and so you remember certain statements that brother branham would make and they become almost like a hallmark almost like an ancient landmark in your mind and i could hear bro and this one has served me well many times i can hear brother branham saying he's telling a story and and he was a little bit questioned about it he said and he said like this he said but i knew better than to disobey that voice brother jack that served me at that moment i was just a young preacher and i was really not wanting to do that but i heard that it come back see jesus said what i do now you don't know but you'll know her after the holy spirit will bring it back and i can hear brother random saying but i knew better than to disobey that voice and i said okay we'll flip it oh my and sin i said lord help me never and to this day 30 years later in ministry i've never that i know of never knowingly broke that promise to the lord i've been tempted to several times but never never have i let that go it's been good to be in the house of god today i'm gonna say something i said in a long time if you want to turn around shake hands with somebody say god bless you amen amen no i'm not forcing you to if you don't want to don't don't worry about it give them a give them a mid-air shake amen sing for us brother bradley [Music] oh yes what a good song jehovah mama um [Music] i love this [Music] of the king [Music] let's raise our hands and sing it again now let's worship him a little bit oh in your presence lord of jehovah [Music] come on give him the praise his name is doom god oh my yes you're worthy of it lord oh prince of peace [Music] [Music] my that's beautiful oh i think

that softly let's bow our heads all over the audience father i know i followed your will today i know i did so i know that your word has went to the hearts of the people and i'm praying lord jesus that as they go from this building as we dismiss lord and the people leave at their own choosing father in whatever scenario they find themselves in with the balance of this day or the balance of this week today being the first day of the week whatever the balance of this week holds for us lord let us remember long the words that we heard in here today beginning from the sunday school to now lord and all the songs and the praises and the commitments that people made in their hearts speaking to you lord there are people in here today lord the word touched their heart and they they they spoke to you about it and you heard what they had to say i pray you'll help them now lord to keep that lord give them strength give them purpose and courage may they open up those prayer chambers those prayer closets again break them back open help me pray for them help me pray their kids through help me pray the church through help me pray lord god it's not only can't all be done by the by the pastor even

preaching all the church services all the youth meetings all the gatherings all the fellowship everything lord god it's going to take it all this is an end time age that's quite impossible but lord you know you've made your bride foolproof she can't be deceived the her virgin womb is already sealed it can't receive the life of another she's predestinated not to fall lord but we want to be victorious in our daily lives i don't just want to be one of those lord who took your name but never really wanted a relationship took your name but never really wanted to bring forth your life i
