[3:29] good deal good good from the indication
[3:32] from the booth
[3:33] so we want to continue our study today
[3:35] in the book of revelation
[3:37] we're going to be i've i've put out
[3:39] three verses i'd like to cover today
[3:41] verse eight nine and ten
[3:43] we'll read it from verse one
[3:46] revelation chapter 1. the revelation of
[3:49] jesus christ
[3:52] excuse me which god gave to him to show
[3:54] unto his servants things which must
[3:56] shortly come to pass
[3:58] and he sent and signified it by his
[4:00] angel
[4:01] unto his servant john who bear record of
[4:04] the word of god
[4:05] and of the testimony of jesus christ and
[4:09] of all things that he saw
[4:11] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[4:13] hear the words of this prophecy
[4:15] and keep those things which are written
[4:17] therein for the time
[4:19] is at hand john to the seven churches
[4:22] which are in asia grace be unto you and
[4:24] peace
[4:25] from him which is and which was and
[4:27] which is to come
[4:29] and from the seven spirits which are
[4:31] before his throne
[4:33] and from jesus christ who is the
[4:36] faithful witness
[4:37] and the first begotten of the dead and
[4:40] the prince of the
[4:42] kings of the earth unto him that loved
[4:44] us and washed us from our sins
[4:47] in his own blood and hath made us kings
[4:50] and priests unto god and his father to
[4:53] him be glory and dominion forever and
[4:55] ever
[4:56] amen behold he cometh with clouds
[4:59] and every eye shall see him and they
[5:02] also which pierced him
[5:04] and all kindreds of the earth shall wail
[5:08] because of him even so amen
[5:12] now if you remember in our last time i
[5:15] believe which would have
[5:17] i think today did i say today was part
[5:19] eight i believe i sent yes thanks sir
[5:22] in part 7 we announced that we were
[5:26] kind of changing up a little bit doing
[5:29] more of an overview study
[5:31] we're going to do a much more thorough
[5:33] exhaustive study
[5:35] in the podcast which we do not have
[5:38] available
[5:38] yet uh that's still um coming but we're
[5:42] we have all things pretty much ready
[5:43] we're just waiting on one or two final
[5:46] pieces to move forward with that
[5:48] so i we want to look today
[5:52] as you'll remember when we finished up
[5:53] with verse 7
[5:55] we found him coming with clouds and
[5:58] every eye
[5:59] shall see him now it's it's
[6:02] interesting that you have in
[6:06] this verse every eye seeing him
[6:09] so i think that we can certainly
[6:11] correlate
[6:12] as we were saying last time that this is
[6:15] at the end of the tribulation because
[6:19] we find in first thessalonians chapter 5
[6:22] verse 2 that he comes as a thief in the
[6:26] night
[6:26] jesus also makes reference to this in
[6:29] the gospels i don't want to
[6:31] backtrack too far into last portion
[6:34] but we find that that for the rapture of
[6:38] the bride
[6:40] he appears in the air now here's an
[6:42] interesting contrast that i didn't cover
[6:44] last time
[6:45] if you think about it it's a very fair
[6:48] question to say
[6:50] so why do we see him
[6:53] in the air but in revelation
[6:57] but the world doesn't but in revelation
[7:00] 19 all the world does
[7:02] see him and the answer of course is
[7:04] actually pretty self-evident
[7:06] that when he comes in the air he's
[7:09] coming
[7:10] as the bridegroom as the groom of the
[7:13] bride therefore only the bride
[7:15] sees him but in revelation 19
[7:18] he's coming as the judge and we realize
[7:21] that all humanity will see him and wail
[7:24] because of him because
[7:26] that they realize they've missed his
[7:29] first
[7:30] uh rapture coming they didn't see him
[7:33] because
[7:33] as we said he the dead in christ
[7:37] rise first and then we which are alive
[7:39] and remain
[7:40] are caught up together with them to meet
[7:43] the lord in the air now of course we are
[7:45] we know that if the pattern and we
[7:47] believe it will
[7:48] if the pattern follows the way it did in
[7:51] the gospels
[7:53] that there was a resurrection and then
[7:56] um
[7:56] there were they were seen of many and uh
[7:59] not all the graves were opened
[8:01] in the in the gospel days in the in the
[8:03] days when jesus rose from the grave
[8:06] but brother branham said it was those
[8:07] who died in the faith of abraham the
[8:09] true
[8:10] israelites because not all israel is
[8:13] israel just like
[8:14] all people who claim to be christians
[8:16] are not christians
[8:17] and so we realize that you have to come
[8:21] god's provided way and there's many that
[8:24] try to come
[8:25] some other way and they are rejected and
[8:28] cast in
[8:29] to the tribulation jesus you'll remember
[8:32] gives this parable
[8:33] of finding someone trying to come into
[8:35] the wedding supper
[8:37] but he did not have the garments and we
[8:39] realize that we are dressed in the
[8:41] garments of the word this was brother
[8:43] branham's
[8:44] great feeling in his heart that he was
[8:46] going to be privileged to dress the
[8:48] bride
[8:49] and the garments of the word so we
[8:52] see him in the air because we're the
[8:55] bride
[8:56] the world doesn't see him but in
[8:58] revelation 19 when he comes back as the
[9:00] judge
[9:01] every eye shall see him now we move
[9:03] quickly into verse 8
[9:05] i am alpha and omega the beginning
[9:09] and the ending saith the lord which is
[9:12] which was which is to come so
[9:16] here again another reference again
[9:17] you're going to see that reference
[9:19] often because it's just prophet priest
[9:22] and king
[9:23] and so he comes in various forms that
[9:25] which was
[9:26] that which is that which was and that
[9:29] which is to come that which is
[9:31] is in the form of priest that which was
[9:35] was in the form of son of man prophet
[9:37] and that which is to come
[9:39] he's the king the son of david so that
[9:42] which
[9:42] is which was and which is to come it's
[9:45] jesus christ
[9:46] the same yesterday today and forever
[9:48] this is how
[9:50] the true bride always identifies him now
[9:53] it's interesting because he emphasizes
[9:56] to john
[9:56] john who is a representative of the
[9:59] bride of christ brother branham taught
[10:01] us that
[10:01] and the revelation of jesus christ
[10:03] series i i have that in a note further
[10:05] on down we won't get to it today
[10:07] but he said that john represented the uh
[10:10] the blood he represented the
[10:12] blood-washed
[10:13] saints of god all right so he taught
[10:15] that very clearly now
[10:17] i am alpha and omega and we realize that
[10:20] brother branham points out in numerous
[10:22] places i'll give you two references in
[10:25] 1958
[10:27] um in the baptism of the holy spirit
[10:30] he makes the reference also in 1964
[10:33] in the masterpiece brother branham
[10:35] comments on this
[10:37] again that he's alpha and omega
[10:40] because he's he's the beginning and he's
[10:43] the end
[10:44] but he's not the in between now you have
[10:47] to watch that because
[10:49] there's also places where brother
[10:50] branham says and we say it commonly
[10:53] he's the a to z the alpha the omega and
[10:55] everything in the middle
[10:56] and brother branham makes that analogy
[10:58] also
[10:59] based on the fact that jesus is walking
[11:03] in the midst of seven lamp stands
[11:05] he is in the midst of his church he said
[11:07] i will never leave you nor forsake you
[11:10] but the emphasis so it's not a denial
[11:13] that christ is walking in his church
[11:15] down through the ages christ was with
[11:17] them all the way
[11:18] but what we find is what the scripture
[11:20] is saying that brother branham is
[11:22] illustrating
[11:23] is that in the alpha he was purely him
[11:26] and the omega it returns to purely him
[11:30] the word and completely the pure word
[11:33] but in the middle
[11:34] while he was in the in between not
[11:37] everything in the in between was him
[11:40] and that's how you look at i'll say it
[11:42] again he was in the in between
[11:44] but not everything in the in between
[11:48] was him because we find that mankind had
[11:52] injected all kinds of doctrines and
[11:54] dogmas i think i've got enough time to
[11:56] read these two quotes for you
[11:58] because that might be a struggle in some
[12:00] people's mind remember this is 1958
[12:03] the baptism of the holy spirit remember
[12:06] as
[12:06] jesus was seen in the cross standing in
[12:09] the seven golden
[12:10] candlesticks the darkest was what
[12:13] was the furthest away from him his right
[12:16] hand
[12:17] and his left hand so now the
[12:19] illustration brother branham is giving
[12:21] is christ is standing if you if you've
[12:23] ever seen the hebrew menorah
[12:25] he's standing with his arm stretched and
[12:27] he's the alpha
[12:28] and he's the omega but but you'll notice
[12:31] that
[12:32] it's he's the closest with his hand to
[12:34] the alpha
[12:35] and the closest with his hand to the
[12:37] omega all the ages in between
[12:39] are further away from his purity you get
[12:42] that illustration
[12:44] so he says the darkest was what the
[12:47] furthest away from him
[12:49] his right hand and his left hand and he
[12:51] was to look upon
[12:53] as alpha and omega not
[12:56] the in between the alpha he repeats it
[13:00] the alpha and omega
[13:02] as he had his hand stretched he was
[13:05] jasper
[13:06] and sardone stone and we find that
[13:08] that's the perfect alpha and omega
[13:09] birthstones
[13:11] from ephraim to benjamin which was
[13:14] benjamin and i mean benjamin and reuben
[13:16] the first
[13:16] and the last there he had his hands
[13:19] stretched
[13:20] there he stood he says it again in the
[13:22] masterpiece 1964
[13:24] the alpha and omega is the same he said
[13:28] i
[13:28] am alpha and omega he never said
[13:31] anything in between i am alpha and omega
[13:36] the first and the last so in our sunday
[13:39] school lesson here this morning when we
[13:40] look at verse 8
[13:42] he's saying i am alpha and omega to not
[13:45] add to the scripture but under
[13:46] a prophetic authority we can show you
[13:49] that what he's indicating
[13:51] is that in the alpha he's fully perfect
[13:54] in the omega
[13:55] he's fully perfect and while he is
[13:58] in the midst of the seven lamp stands he
[14:00] is in the in between
[14:02] but everything in the in between is not
[14:05] fully him
[14:06] because men have added their own
[14:08] understanding to it all right
[14:10] i am alpha and omega the beginning
[14:13] and the ending the first and the last
[14:16] there's a lot that i could begin to
[14:18] break down here
[14:19] but we're going to try to keep moving
[14:21] all right
[14:23] so we come now to the verse
[14:26] 9. as we said we're only doing an
[14:28] overview during our sunday school class
[14:30] we'll make a much deeper
[14:32] i'm skipping tons and tons and tons of
[14:34] notes that we will cover on the podcast
[14:36] um verse 9 i john
[14:39] who also am your brother and companion
[14:44] in tribulation and in the kingdom and
[14:46] patience of jesus christ
[14:48] i was in the aisle that is called patmos
[14:50] for the word of god
[14:52] and for the testimony of jesus christ
[14:54] now we know
[14:55] that the book of revelation teaches us
[14:58] that the testimony of jesus christ
[15:00] is the spirit of prophecy so we realize
[15:04] that that that going forward into the
[15:06] ages
[15:08] he's saying i'm going to be with you and
[15:11] and john is saying i am your companion
[15:15] in tribulation and in the kingdom and
[15:18] patience of jesus christ so john under
[15:21] the anointing of the spirit
[15:23] is letting us understand that if you're
[15:26] going to be
[15:27] in the kingdom of christ down no matter
[15:30] what age
[15:31] that you are going to go through you're
[15:34] going to
[15:35] you're going to have to expect
[15:38] tribulation
[15:39] and you're going to have to have the
[15:41] patience of jesus christ
[15:43] and so we realize that john who was
[15:46] caught up
[15:47] in the spirit we'll catch that in our
[15:48] next verse and was translated all the
[15:51] way to the lord's day
[15:53] was able under the anointing of that
[15:56] revelation given to john
[15:58] by jesus christ that john was able now
[16:01] to give a message
[16:03] to all the ages you're going to be
[16:06] the kingdom the kingdom is within you
[16:09] you're going to be the temple of the
[16:11] holy ghost you're going to be the living
[16:13] representatives
[16:15] of god in the earth and therefore i'm
[16:18] going to be your companion
[16:19] and you're going to be my companion just
[16:22] as we have been under tribulation
[16:24] you are going to be under tribulation
[16:26] you're going to be hated and despised
[16:28] and rejected
[16:29] and you're going to need to exercise
[16:32] patience
[16:33] that can only come to you under the
[16:36] revelation of jesus christ
[16:38] because the testimony of jesus christ is
[16:41] the spirit of prophecy
[16:43] and you're going to need to have that
[16:45] kind of prophetic
[16:46] anointing on you down through the ages
[16:51] we realize that that he that we realize
[16:54] if we look at how that paul
[16:56] you know god had a purpose it's
[16:58] interesting because we see
[17:00] john on a prison island of patmos it's
[17:03] basically a roman version of alcatraz
[17:06] and you'd you in the human mind you'd
[17:08] say well wow
[17:10] you know john could be so much more
[17:12] effective
[17:13] if he wasn't on a prison island and just
[17:15] the opposite was true
[17:17] you'd think that paul could you imagine
[17:19] and and i
[17:20] i i don't think that we should fool
[17:23] ourselves
[17:24] into imagining that this didn't occur to
[17:26] the apostle paul
[17:27] sitting in dungeons chained to walls
[17:29] kicking rats away
[17:31] writing what we hold today to be the
[17:34] pure word of god you say
[17:35] man paul if he could if god would have
[17:37] kept him out of prison
[17:39] how much more effective he could have
[17:41] been sometimes friends
[17:43] god puts his church into positions where
[17:46] you
[17:46] think that this is a disadvantage but
[17:48] hold on
[17:49] you're under the spirit of prophecy just
[17:52] have
[17:52] patience have the patience of jesus
[17:55] christ because
[17:56] god is working out a purpose it doesn't
[18:00] matter what you go through
[18:02] god has a purpose in it brother branham
[18:05] makes a reference not only will we talk
[18:07] about john and talk about paul
[18:09] in prison but i think it's fair to bring
[18:11] up you know brother branham's life it's
[18:13] certainly a journey less traveled by
[18:16] people
[18:16] and no one really wants to go through
[18:18] tribulation let's just be honest
[18:20] but it is a necessary element brother
[18:23] branham makes a reference to how
[18:25] his his great suffering and i'm not
[18:27] going to get down into the details of
[18:28] all that today because we're just
[18:30] overviewing on our on our revelation
[18:32] series
[18:33] but brother branham i will just make a
[18:35] few comments how that
[18:37] he talks about the the suffering the
[18:39] loss of his wife and the child and and
[18:42] the rejection you know
[18:43] he says that you don't realize that a
[18:46] rose has to be
[18:47] crushed to get the fragrance out of it
[18:49] it's why jesus had to be crushed
[18:51] because he was the rose of sharon you
[18:54] can see
[18:55] uh in the life of brother branham how
[18:58] that he began to suffer
[18:59] isolation you know uh from the very
[19:02] beginning
[19:03] of his life and in childhood the very
[19:06] first thing
[19:07] that we find brother branham coming into
[19:10] the world he's born
[19:11] in abject poverty and then we find in
[19:14] his life story
[19:15] that his father you know commits a
[19:17] violent crime and then
[19:18] they're going to have to send the law up
[19:20] there on horseback to arrest him and so
[19:22] you know they have to flee in the middle
[19:24] of the night and he's got a
[19:26] he he he's he's basically a vagabond
[19:28] branham's were vagabonds he's being
[19:30] drugged from pillar to post
[19:32] we find that when his daddy sets up
[19:34] later on
[19:35] that he's a bootlegger and this is
[19:37] during the time of prohibition so
[19:39] now william branham as a child is even
[19:42] further
[19:42] isolated remember how he says he never
[19:44] got to play with all the kids because he
[19:46] had to pack water to a still
[19:48] and but but it was during that
[19:51] oppressive time
[19:52] that a angel spoke to him out of a tree
[19:55] and said don't ever
[19:56] drink smoke or defile your body in any
[19:59] way so god
[20:00] had a great purpose in it we find that
[20:04] you know when brother branham began to
[20:06] begin to grow as
[20:07] into a young man he talks about how that
[20:10] he'd be walking in town and nobody
[20:12] you know about nobody in town uh would
[20:14] be seen talking to him in public
[20:17] because he why he was a branham and and
[20:19] they had a
[20:20] they had a bad name you know his daddy
[20:23] had rejected him so
[20:24] you've got to understand here's a young
[20:26] man that god is
[20:28] is preparing for the greatest event
[20:31] since the days of the early church and
[20:33] he's got to have this prophet
[20:36] especially prepared he's born in poverty
[20:39] his
[20:39] daddy's a crook and criminal and breaks
[20:42] the law he's got to move
[20:43] then he's a bootlegger then he's packing
[20:45] water he doesn't get to play he's in
[20:47] he's a young man
[20:48] in the streets they'll talk to him in
[20:50] private
[20:51] but as soon as they see other people
[20:52] coming right away they act like they
[20:54] don't know him
[20:54] he said i'd see people coming down the
[20:56] street and they would see me and they'd
[20:58] cross the street
[20:59] to keep from talking to me in public
[21:02] because he had a bad name even though he
[21:04] said i never did those things
[21:06] but i was a branham and it was guilt by
[21:08] association
[21:10] his daddy had rejected him as a boy
[21:12] calling him he said he's the one
[21:14] that i raised which crushed
[21:17] brother branham you can imagine a young
[21:18] boy
[21:19] who idolizes his father being called a
[21:22] by the man who
[21:24] he you who was his hero so you know he's
[21:27] he's he's got all of this to contend
[21:30] with and
[21:31] and nobody you know nobody in public
[21:34] wants to have anything to do with him
[21:35] though
[21:36] he had been a model citizen and a very
[21:39] decent young man who didn't drink didn't
[21:41] smoke didn't run with women
[21:43] brother madam says if i if i was out
[21:45] with a girl and she tried anything
[21:47] you know he said i'd just take her home
[21:49] and so
[21:50] we we realized that he flees to the west
[21:53] he goes west because he had longed to be
[21:55] a cowboy
[21:56] really he longed to be out on his own
[21:58] and you know
[22:00] trying to run no doubt from all of that
[22:02] rejection
[22:04] i love the story that he tells here
[22:07] show us the father and it will satisfy
[22:09] us he says i remember
[22:11] this is before his conversion the first
[22:13] herd of cattle i ever tried to drive out
[22:16] of the mountains
[22:17] and my feet felt like two big hunks of
[22:19] lead i rolled off
[22:21] that horse and got my blanket and i i
[22:23] thought i was a real cowan
[22:25] i put my head in the saddle and there's
[22:28] an old guy there with us called slim and
[22:30] another fella from texas had a guitar
[22:32] they were playing songs and the fella
[22:35] slim had a comb with a piece of paper in
[22:37] it
[22:37] he keeping up with him in tune and and
[22:40] and the herd was all bedded down and
[22:42] after a bit
[22:44] they began to play down at the cross
[22:46] where my savior died
[22:48] it was down there for cleansing from sin
[22:51] i cried
[22:52] and brother branham says my my heart
[22:54] began to jump
[22:55] i took the blanket pulled it up over my
[22:57] head to keep from hearing it because i
[22:59] was a sinner
[23:00] and after the cattle got quiet and i was
[23:03] laying there acting like i was snoring
[23:05] but when i pulled the blanket down i
[23:08] thought
[23:08] now it'll all be over because they've
[23:09] gone to bed and
[23:11] and and to watch it out there with the
[23:14] cattle
[23:15] but then i looked up and then big stars
[23:17] was hanging just above me
[23:19] something said who put them up there
[23:22] seemed like there was a voice that said
[23:24] there's a land beyond the river they
[23:26] call the sweet forever
[23:28] we only reach that shore by faith to
[23:30] greet the degr decree
[23:32] i got my blanket and pulled it up around
[23:34] my ears again
[23:36] and brother branham says god is so great
[23:38] he'll find you i don't care where you
[23:39] are don't try to hide from him
[23:41] you're fighting a losing battle i'm glad
[23:43] to know that we're fighting a losing
[23:45] battle trying to run from him i've never
[23:47] been so happy
[23:48] to lose a battle in my life said he can
[23:50] see you everywhere
[23:52] he goes on and they identified with
[23:53] christ and he said i tried to pull the
[23:55] blanket up
[23:56] and stop my ears up i'd looked up in the
[23:59] stars hanging low
[24:00] and then whispering pines in the
[24:02] mountains seemed to cry
[24:04] adam where art thou oh cattle raising
[24:07] was a second
[24:08] thing i wanted to find god way back out
[24:11] there
[24:11] kicked up on a pair of those spurs i
[24:13] said sir
[24:14] i don't know who you are but don't
[24:17] punish me
[24:18] until i can find the real thing this was
[24:21] a prophet
[24:22] coming through severe rejection and this
[24:24] was john's warning
[24:26] if you're going to be in the kingdom
[24:28] you're going to be a companion in
[24:29] tribulation and you're going to need
[24:32] the patience of jesus christ he finally
[24:35] gets converted
[24:36] he later falls in love with a young girl
[24:38] named hope brumbach
[24:39] he marries her and starts a family
[24:42] finally now
[24:43] the prophet begins to experience some
[24:44] real happiness gets ordained to the
[24:47] missionary baptist church
[24:48] you know he's he's able to participate
[24:50] in something that he was proud of
[24:52] it was such an accomplishment for him
[24:54] because now now for the one of the first
[24:57] times
[24:57] he's got public acceptance and you know
[25:00] he even put a
[25:01] a tag on in front of his old ford that
[25:03] said clergy and brother branham was very
[25:04] proud of that
[25:06] and everything was going good until it
[25:08] wasn't
[25:09] and finally he had to give up that
[25:11] fellowship card in the baptist
[25:12] organization
[25:13] because he wouldn't endorse women
[25:15] preachers because it was contrary
[25:18] to bible teaching so again he's rejected
[25:21] again because and and again because of
[25:24] taking a stand for what was right so he
[25:28] loses a this coveted public recognition
[25:31] he stumbles into the pentecostals you
[25:34] know and
[25:35] and and gets thrilled with that tries to
[25:37] take his young wife and family in that
[25:39] direction
[25:40] and then his own family comes against
[25:42] him his mother-in-law
[25:43] rejects him he'll not take my daughter
[25:45] to such a thing like that
[25:47] and while hope would have went along
[25:48] with him he doesn't go through with it
[25:51] and now the whole world comes crashing
[25:53] down on him 1937 flood
[25:56] and everything that he loved in the
[25:58] world he loved the most
[26:00] he would lose looked as even as if god
[26:03] himself had rejected him when he's
[26:05] trying to pray for his baby
[26:07] he finally pieces his sad life back
[26:09] together again
[26:11] and god gives him a new family he has a
[26:13] visitation from an angel gets a
[26:15] commission to go forward
[26:17] he begins right away and right away he
[26:19] begins to gain acceptance
[26:21] very quickly among the
[26:24] pentecostal movement almost at an
[26:26] unprecedented scale
[26:28] it's all going good until it wasn't and
[26:31] we find out that once again
[26:33] rejection isolation churches start
[26:36] rejecting him
[26:37] all the doors eventually close he comes
[26:39] to 1962
[26:40] and he says the present stage of my
[26:42] ministry all doors are closed demas has
[26:45] forsaken me
[26:46] and we find out that once again the
[26:49] words of
[26:50] john are coming to pass i john
[26:53] who also am your brother and companion
[26:56] in tribulation but from all of this
[27:00] god brings forth the greatest collective
[27:03] event since the days of the early church
[27:06] we're going to get the opening of the
[27:08] seven seals giving birth to a movement
[27:10] and a message that has literally
[27:13] gathered a bride from
[27:14] around the world it's more relevant
[27:16] today than at any previous time
[27:19] i i even today enjoy the privilege
[27:22] that brother branham never enjoyed to
[27:25] preach to a mature
[27:26] church and brother branham's day they
[27:28] just had an infancy to them
[27:30] but we realized that at this greatest
[27:32] epoch of
[27:33] human history that had ever been known
[27:36] because it's now the
[27:37] consummation of the ages and the day
[27:41] of the lord when all the wrong is dealt
[27:44] with
[27:44] and all creation is set back in its
[27:47] correct order
[27:48] then an eternal day dawns on from there
[27:51] i'm here to tell you something friends
[27:53] brother branham says in the revelation
[27:54] chapter 4 part 1 i got to close
[27:57] he said can anything happen to a
[27:59] christian without it's for the best no
[28:01] no no
[28:02] so what did god set him out there alone
[28:04] on the island for
[28:06] to give us this book of revelation god
[28:08] just pulls the wool
[28:10] over the devil's eyes anytime he wants
[28:13] to
[28:14] he simply can he says i just love him
[28:17] so this makes romans 8 28 come to pass
[28:21] all things work together for the good of
[28:23] them that love
[28:24] god all right now i realize that
[28:27] there might be things i'm saying that
[28:29] i've said before in various other
[28:30] sermons
[28:31] i'm trying to get this book of
[28:32] revelation on recording
[28:34] so that we have it on the archive so so
[28:37] he comes to verse 10 i was in the spirit
[28:41] on the lord's day and so we
[28:44] we realized friends that you're going to
[28:47] need i'll just say this
[28:48] as i close out my take my last two
[28:50] minutes uh to close out that
[28:53] that this verse 10 so in my mind
[28:56] so perfectly follows verse nine that
[28:59] says you're going to have tribulation
[29:00] and you're going to need patience
[29:02] and then john says i was in the spirit
[29:05] on the lord's day
[29:06] because the lord's day now is where we
[29:08] have come to
[29:09] uh and it's the time of judgment it's
[29:11] the time of the total rejection of god's
[29:13] word
[29:14] and i'm here to tell you you're going to
[29:16] need to be in the spirit to endure it
[29:20] there's going to be no way the pattern
[29:22] you know is being established at the
[29:24] onset of the church
[29:26] that the way of the lord is a despised
[29:29] way
[29:30] as jesus said it would be you know if
[29:33] you look at even from eden
[29:35] starting with the serpent you know
[29:37] nobody liked god's way
[29:39] not the serpent not eve the serpent
[29:41] didn't like god's way because
[29:43] his daddy didn't like god's way satan
[29:46] had not
[29:46] liked god's way and so we find that
[29:50] that you know we we we have to come into
[29:53] the spirit first corinthians 12 13
[29:55] for by one spirit we're all baptized
[29:57] into one body
[29:58] so no wonder it takes a supernatural
[30:02] change in the soul or i'm here to tell
[30:05] you
[30:06] nobody would endure this level of
[30:09] rejection
[30:10] nobody could endure the judgments that
[30:13] even we as the bride
[30:15] the judgments beginning to rain down
[30:17] upon the earth you won't survive i'm
[30:19] here to tell you
[30:20] now that you've arrived in verse and
[30:22] verse 10
[30:23] you better take heed and be in the
[30:26] spirit because
[30:27] being in the spirit is the only way
[30:30] that you're going to endure the day of
[30:32] the lord
[30:33] amen we're going to stop right there i'm
[30:35] completely out of time even used up my
[30:37] five minutes overtime
[30:38] and so god bless you and uh the regular
[30:41] service uh will commence shortly god
[30:43] bless you
[30:50] you
