we're happy uh in the Lord for that let me pause you there brother Andrew thank you kindly um praise the Lord wonderful time in the Lord we're looking for today and um I've U trying to bring this ninth installment of uh abiding in Christ and I really think I might finish it today now that's that's my purpose that's my plan and I'm GNA try to be real studious and real methodical and if I do that and don't get preaching really hard which I'm not too good at not doing then we'll we'll get through it amen I uh because I can see more material but I also can see that it's kind of going in a different direction so maybe today will be the day praise the Lord amen I was enjoying uh all the brother Tony uh he walked by my office and and stuck his head in just to check on me as he always does I said man you went old church today hey I said wow I was in the back office and they were in there practicing my toe was tapping I was like wow that that is wonderful I love those old church songs and then uh and then he also uh brings in all of the modern stuff so it's wonderful wonderful I love it amen props to Brother JD for that uh tremendous Sunday school class amen this morning I was telling brother Jason a little bit of feedback CU preachers like to hear a little bit of feedback and um you know and believe it or not they want to hear constructive criticism if you got the right attitude but I was telling him that I was speaking to a brother personally the other day and he was telling me that we he was just testifying about you know having your home having everything in order you remember the Bible says that a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways so if he if he's double-minded which means he's just not really operating by faith in God's word if he really believed it brother brandham said you know these things that we do sometimes which are not sin he said you do those things because you're an unbeliever if you were a real believer in God's word and you believed it and it was a revelation in your heart you wouldn't do those things your life would be different amen and so when you when you when you get double-minded like that where you know it's true and but you're not surrendering and you don't want to go to hell and you want to go in the Rapture but you're not willing to make that full commitment then you know what you find is that there's is that when you're double-minded like that there's instability in all your circle in your home and your marriage and your family and your parenting and your job and your business and your reputation it will affect your whole circle see so have faith in God Amen and believe and accept his word and this brother was just testifying that you know he he um he said I was sitting there a couple of session ago and brother Jason was on this series and he just made a statement and he said and it just went through me like like thunder like he just he said it just hit me and Dove deep and and he said I realized in that moment just that Moment of clarity he said that I realized that in in areas of my home and my family and my leadership my marriage child rearing my business everything he said I realized that I could allow the Lord far more more freedom to move and operate through me than I had been and he said he made up his mind right then he was going to make some of those changes so I tell you something friends when when you live in a way that God can get behind that that's oh that's gold that's premium amen you don't want to be uh the obstacle to the Lord being able to that's why brother BR was brother brandom's whole theme in door and doors you know that uh God wants to use you as I read here in a a quote here a session or two ago I think it was the last session that you are transmitters remember that one and he wants to transmit his word through you so we're going to look at a number of things brother brandham said to try to finish out our thought today and uh we're going to just ask you to be in prayer uh when we uh read our scripture and we pray amen I don't see sister Brenda I don't think she's here today either uh her both her and sister Debbie have been quite sick and um sister Brenda thinks maybe it's even bronchitis sister Debbie just um just fever cough deep deep wet cough and um uh full head and and so I said well babe you know the rules you can't come unless you want to wear um one of those suits you know where people suit up I said you you can't you can't do that so first person soon as you open your mouth people run from you so so she's uh there streaming today and uh we we want to oh yeah yeah I got it in big bold uh big letters so I don't forget I even bolded them amen and so I we're going to we're going to have a baby dedication today at last we're going to get to dedicate brother Elliot and I told uh jonath said don't let me forget that cuz sometimes I'll come out there and forget the names of my children and and and he said he said well we'll just I said wave do something he said we'll just come walking up with him and I said so amen praise the Lord all right brother Andrew give us a cord of bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin amen praise the Lord as brother John sister Meredith and U little red come this way amen oh bring them in bring them in bring them in from the field of sin bring them in bring them bring the little ones to Jes amen hi bud been a long time waiting on this look at that wow hey check out all them people no they're staring at you bro look yeah see that amen what's his full name Elliot Elliot James praise the Lord wow what a treasure the Bible says that children are the heritage of the Lord you can see why soon as you get your hands on them you realize this had to come from God Amen let's pray father I hold in my hands a lovely little brother our little Elliot James and Lord we're bringing him back to you who gave him to us you gave him to this family you gave him to this whole assembly Lord and and the parents now are coming Lord as they did with with hazel Lord to say Lord we have no ability to to fulfill this task it'll have to take you Lord you'll be the one operating through these Earthly parents Lord he's own loan to them and we realize today and even we're going to prove by the word of God that you are his father Lord above these parents and so Master we give him into your care make him strong healthy grow may be raised in the admonition of the Lord raised up in the way that he should go Grant it father when he's old it won't depart from him we thank you for his life Lord now preserve and protect him we commit him to you and dedicate him to you to be raised in your admition in Jesus name amen amen you think I should keep him Hazel up here with me maybe yeah yeah yeah so what you think amen praise Lord [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Lord Oh my bring the little ones to Jesus let's stand back to our feet this morning amen we're going to invite you to Isaiah chapter 65 amen so brother Mark after the the opening text you can just go ahead and pull up the title title screen amen I'm using a PowerPoint today I don't always do it but um I I've got a number of quotes I want to read and so to keep me on track it's more for me than it is for you so that we won't um go too long and we'll get our point across um the way that I have it envisioned Isaiah 65 and verse 17- 23 you have it say [Music] amen for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying there shall be no more then an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die and 100 years old but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be a cursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their Offspring with them let's pray father now I just having read your word Lord and I just relax myself now to be led of you with every phrase that we will make today Lord there's plenty that I have written down here to say but it's only if you want it said Lord I feel in my heart it's from you and if you have anything further to say you're always welcome Lord to drop that in and father we're just here to learn of you and learn of your ways I commit it all to you now we ask for your mercy on our sick Lord and we're thanking of sister Brenda and sister Debbie Lord right now and father we miss seeing them here and uh we're we're missing them right away father and we ask for your mercy on them master and that you would make them well and rebuke the enemy master and may they be made completely whole even this very day we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated want to be uh also remembering um there's a there's some of the church down went down to be with uh brother Joe in those meetings there I know Matt was there ministering last night tonight and I think he was going to stay through this morning thank you brother Tony and uh so he'll be driving in I know brother Brad and Sister Sarah also I believe uh went down fact is I know they do they that they did now that I think about it um so brother Brad was talking about what a wonderful service it was last night brother Matt ministered there and so just want to be praying for them uh on their drive back will you do it amen and any others who perhaps are awayed today I see brother Steve sister Emily's still away so we're missing them as well and every different person also all right so when last we left off in our study we were comparing the Generation of Vipers in Matthew chapter 3 the ones that came out to see John's baptism you remember that and the Bible says when the Sadducees and Pharisees came and John saw them coming to be baptized he said to them who has warned you to flee from the wrath of God it seems apparent to me that what was clear to John was that they were not coming because they were LED of the holy spirit that they were coming of their own accord for reasons that that aren't made clear but whatever the reasons were I'm not here to say I know what was in their heart but apparently the prophet Elijah standing there knew that it wasn't a good reason amen that they were there for some nefarious reason some nefarious purpose and he asked them you know who has warned you to flee from the wrath of God it's obvious pretty obvious that it wasn't God because the Sadducees and the Pharisees did not believe John and fact is when Jesus uh challenged them in the public whether his ministry were of God or no uh they would not answer that question because they they said within themselves and they reasoned they huddled up and said well if we say no cuz we really don't believe that he was that prophet and we sent people to even ask him and he denied that he was which a prophet would always do and so you know we don't believe he was because you know we didn't we didn't agree with his message he he rebuked the king for his marriage and divorce situation and and we had him killed and so no we don't believe in him but we can't say that because the people believe he was a great prophet and they might kill us if we say that but then we also can't say that we do believe him because first that would be a lie but then second Jesus would immediately say then if he was of God why do you not believe what he said about me he said I'm the Lamb of God that I've come to take away the sin of the world he said he saw the spirit of God descend like a dove and rest upon me amen so if he was of God why do you not believe me see so so it was a it was a conundrum for them unsolvable gordian not they weren't they're going to try to to unravel and because there was no good answer they could give I would I just I just would hate to be that guy I just would hate to where I I I I I couldn't acknowledge the truth if I could to say it that simply I'm glad today I can acknowledge the truth I'm glad to and and and and the truth doesn't always agree with the way I act and therefore I repent and I come back and I say Lord I'm sorry I didn't follow your truth cuz I want to follow your truth there I go preaching already so we find then that John identifies this Generation of Vipers and we were comparing that Generation of Vipers in Matthew 3 with the generation of Jesus Christ from Matthew 1 and we were pointing out that one of the things we're pointing out is that that they were both identified in the singular now that's an important point they were both identified you Generation of Vipers single generation of plural people or are you part of the gener generation of Jesus Christ and he tracks it back you know from Abraham 14 generations to David from David 14 generations to the to the to the uh captivity and then from the cap the restoration then 14 Generations uh coming to to uh Joseph now we know that none of them were biologically connected to Jesus amen but yet they were that seed line of Christ that treed its way through the Scripture it it it was a marker all the way traveling through the word that there would be a seed of God in the earth and there would be people to receive it and people would display what was really inside of them and it had always been there before the foundation of the world Amen now we're not talking about since the foundation of the world the remnant of the woman's seed in every age There Was An Old Testament Remnant there was a new testament Remnant sometimes you'd call them the unwise Virgin there was a Remnant in every age and they're always listed as having been known of God since the foundation of the world since the book of life and their names remained in that book of life only concerning Jesus Christ and his elect bride the Bible doesn't say since the foundation of the world in every case there only three times and in all three three out of three times it says that Jesus and his bride were with God before the foundation of the world and that's the only one it applies to all the others are since the foundation of the world Amen so so we realize then that this generation is a single generation they were both identified in the singular and not the plural proving firstly that they both have a single source of life amen governing I should say governing their life cuz Satan can't create life but the Generation of Vipers are governed by a single Source of Life the generation of Jesus Christ are governed by a single source of life amen you're following me see now make no mistake today you your life is either being guided from above or beneath that's right full stop amen I'm not now I'm not even talking about whether you're a c Gene of God whether you're even born again I'm talking about what is controlling what is influencing your life what are what are your priorities in life and how much position as we were saying with the brother testifying how much ability does God have to flow through you unhindered and that's what's been the theme of our our whole series we're not talking about coming into the new birth where come to me you weary or heavy laden and I'll give you rest but then we've proven you by the Bible that he goes on to the next level and he says now now learn of me take my yoke upon you and I will give you rest for your souls that's next level that's where you are resting in Christ completely your life is hid in Christ Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit has free reign over every aspect of your life oh my God Amen if any aspect of your life is not God honoring then it's been controlled from beneath period amen because that you are born the wrong way you are born in sin and you come into the world under the control of the beneath righten that power let me say to you today that power has one goal just like God has one goal brother randam said in all the Bible and all the people and all the stories was all in expression of that one goal and that was that God wanted to have a kingdom that he could express himself into so we realize that God it's not it's not it's it's not wrong to say God created a family cuz in the beginning God created and said let us make I get it but but it doesn't entail God's full expression in the godhead here's a better way to say it God became a family see and this is why Jesus is the express image of the father as a human amen we'll talk about that a little more as we go so they both got a goal so let me say this again because you were born born the wrong way not by the original spoken word way you are born in sin because you were born under a sex birth and that was not the original way that's what that's what that was the sin in the Garden of Eden and so we realize then that because that you are born that way you come into the world under the control of that which is beneath and that power has one goal and that goal is to take you from the Cradle to the Grave to hell yeah amen full stop yeah amen from the Cradle to the Grave to hell and unless there is a power from above that reaches down and saves you right amen that will be your end Destiny that's right that is the final stop of your train amen from the Cradle to the Grave be a good person be ever so whatever you do all kinds of heroic Deeds there there's been many PE and I'm not saying God doesn't take account for that I'm not saying that at all but I'm just simply saying when it comes to being redeemed God has one provided way to redeem you God's goal is to save everybody I want that clear God's goal is to save everybody amen even those who are not part of his elected family he still makes a way for salvation for any one who God's never going to send anyone to Hell the man sends himself there see and and that's why brother Brandon pointed out said God will never condemn a man for being a sinner because the man was born a sinner God knows that that's not even his fault he didn't volunteer to come that way so brother Ram said God will never condemn him for being a sinner what will condemn the man is he remained a sinner when he didn't have to that the sacrifice of Christ is sufficient to give you salvation see so so I'm just going slow you good these are things that we know well but I want to go over them so God's goal is to save everybody we know that he takes no pleasure even in the death of The Sinner he would that all men come to Salvation Jesus died for the sins of the whole world there's loads and loads of scripture to prove that but you have to choose you say him hold on you better Define him him first cuz he's his word amen when you choose him we're not merely talking about the man 2,000 years ago that walked the shores of Galilee before he was the man on the cross he was this and just because he became the man on the cross didn't stop him from being this he said I come from this I go back to this see he lived as a human to pay the price of redemption a price you couldn't pay even if you followed in his footsteps and died on the cross it wouldn't have mattered because you were born in sin he wasn't it was God's beautiful Masterpiece so you have to choose to accept his provided way and as brother JD was showing us Wednesday night the it it is the way of faith in his revealed word that is God's provided way that's not new that's always been you have to come God's provided way and that and his provided way has always been through faith in his revealed word it started with the First Acceptance of it after the fall after the fall the First Acceptance of it proving that anyone that that wants to follow it can and that was in Abel Abel accepted God's provided Way by faith which is a revelation Cain would not do it even when he had it explained to him you see Abel caught it by Revelation Cain didn't catch the Revelation and when he heard about it he got angry and even God come down and explained it to him like talking to a nine-year-old yeah if you just do as your brother amen so you're not going to impune God not not by any means he's fair and Equitable in all of his ways so we realize then that you know and it's a fair question I I agree that it's a fair question why did he condition it like that faith in his revealed word why is it conditioned that eternal life you come born in sin you you don't want to go to from the Cradle to the Grave to hell you want to go from the cradle find Christ and Christ find you and and you live in glory amen is that your desire if it's not on white you're here today see so so but so you have to come his provided way of faith in his revealed word why did God condition it like that by faith in the word that he reveals as Jesus taught us in Matthew 11 and he to whom the son will reveal him that's the scripture that's what you say why'd he do it like that someday you can ask Jesus but I'm going to give you the answer that he gave me when I asked this morning Lord give me good answer for why you did it like that I'd like to be able to tell the people something that will make sense to them and that anybody could hardly disagree with why did he condition it upon faith in his word that he reveals why not if you want to share your eternal life with everybody why not just make it like a bowl of candy you pass out because salvation first of all is not trick-or treat right amen this ain't a a a grab bag for kitties you understand the gospel's not trick-or treat the gospel's not candy in a bag so why do you have to come God's way so that it eternal life can't be stolen amen it's free yes but you can't steal it amen it has to be offered has to be revealed then you have a choice to make you either surrender or you don't because we're not talking about your choice being intellectual agreement somebody's pretty crazy to to intellectually disagree with God's word so it's not just about intellectual agreement it's about surrender amen it's about I have nothing to offer he's I'm nothing he's everything I take him completely I Surrender my whole life everything about me I don't want to be me anymore now that I've met him I don't want to be me I want to be like him and that is the pathway to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and if you're not willing to come to that surrender you can you can intellectually have human faith in the man of Calvary all day long till the cows come home as as brother Gerald Hugh says till the cows come home and the calves cry for buttermilk but it's you've got to come God's provided way of accepting the Revelation and by faith in his revealed word he does that so that you can't steal it so that you can't let me say it like this and this is going to trigger your your your your brain so that you can't put your hand on the tree of life and live forever in a fallen condition he had already chased Adam and Eve out of the garden for that very reason go read Genesis 3 right amen he had already came into the valley of Shar and stopped the Tower of Babel Midstream and just scattered all over the world because they were breaking in they were getting too close to something and they and they were determined to go back uh break their way they said that that's their testimony that they were trying to break back into heaven and so we realize that he chased Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden he said in Genesis 3 I think 31 maybe three somewhere in three might be in 20-some and he says now lest he put forth his hand and take the tree of life and live forever and so God used cherubims with flaming swords at the entrance and drove man from the garden amen and those Angels standing there with flaming swords and I'm here to tell you something friends don't think about a path we're not talking about a path we're talking about the way of the tree of life that and from then on it's going to become only by Revelation and whom the son will reveal him to am amen and so the the the word of God actually is the sword that blinds the people Jesus was still swinging that same sword that those angels were swinging at and guarding the way of the tree of life he was still swinging that sword when he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man drink his blood you have no life in you and he didn't explain that and he knew it would take 85% of his church and he let it happen they misunderstood where he was even born and he didn't even correct that he could have easily corrected that oh no the messiah's got to have to be born in Bethlehem and this guy you know was out of Nazareth does any good thing come out of Nazareth no we We Know by the word of God he's not Messiah and he could have so easily he said well actually guys um you see what happened was yeah I was born in Bethlehem but my my father you know uh got got a visitation from an angel and we had to flee to Egypt and because the King was trying to kill all the newborns and I actually was born in Bethlehem but then we fled to Egypt for two years and then I got brought back and we we ended up in Nazareth so it's just a misunderstanding don't worry I was born in Bethlehem amen he never even corrected it just went right on see now he's not worried I want to say to you today he's not worried about operating that way because he knoweth them that are his he knows he will not lose one of them he knows according to acts 13 he knows that all those who are ordained will believe amen amen acts 13:48 so let me say to you today that that merely joining a church will not save you right amen could I take it another step even being a part of a a true church right that preaches the revealed word but your attendance is just casual or social and there's no real experience there if that's you today I'm glad you're here but I would love to see you let him come in and make a new creation out of you I'm never going to pull the horse away from the water even if he's not drinking it because at least if he's close might drink it right so so a lot of times we I have a tremendous level of Toleration for people to come in and set for years as long as they'll be decent and moral not cause trouble and they won't they won't bring you know extreme disgrace to the name of Christ in this message we'll let them sit right here because look this is a hospital for the sick and dying that's what it is we hate imagery we're not about that we've never been about that brother Jason has never been about that I I I I'm I'm not worried about your wins and losses column I don't look at the WL columns every day uh in the newspaper about how you're living I don't follow you around I don't have drones flying over your house I even sold my drone just so you wouldn't worry about that and don't worry brother Michael doesn't do that for me he's not a secret agent flying the Drone around watching how y'all live I can't get most started because we we'll be on a row here so what's what's the criteria is that you might come into the house of God and come near The Well of Water of Life That's where elaser sat when the fair Rebecca came and he said Lord here I sit by The Well of Water by The Well of Water of Life and she came and she did exactly like he prophesied she would do in his prayer amen so even casually or socially attending even a true church with a true vision and a true version of the original gospel that won't save you amen that won't take you from the Generation of Vipers which you were born as and put you in the generation of Jesus Christ it won't even give you basic salvation amen you understand even basic salvation you there's a certain minimal requirement for faith in whatever God reveals to you either way you have to come God's provided way even the foolish virgin have to believe the amount of word god reveals to them or they get there at the Judgment Day and they find that their names had been in the book of life but it had been deleted billions will be in that category you know it's funny because sometimes people they have this very uh you know Grandeur you know some great lofty idea that oh you know I want to I want to I'm going to leave a Heritage and and I'm going to live on in my Offspring and then I'll live on and my you know this will be this will be my uh you know my family tree and it'll go on and long after I'm gone I I'll still be living because they they they had the opportunity to actually still be living but they passed it up in life and they chose some esoteric philosophical you know some way of of Eastern religion or or some type of gnosticism and that you know I I realize now that scientists are starting to actually acknowledge that there was an uncaused cause I just heard this recently but they still don't call it God like we would call it they just simply call it some unknown unexplainable energy I wish they'd let that unexplainable energy go through them one time and they'd realize that's tied to a Life Source but people imagine that they will you know oh I have this this wonderful dream that I will live on in my generations and generations and generations now I don't want to burst your bubble but I'm going to give you a reality check going to cover a little bit of biology today you good amen I'm not a geneticist I'm not a biologist I study numerous disciplines of science because as a hobby but I'm I had to really do a lot of research to come up with these answers after 20 Generations there is only 0.004% of you genetically in them amen after 20 Generations there's almost nothing of you left right now I'm not saying DNA DNA is way more than just genes and chromosomes and I don't want to get into an explanation of that but but they contract DNA way back and they find fossilized records I'm not I'm not saying that there's not some portion of DNA there's there's different DNA is not just one thing but as far as like genetically your genes in them yeah after 20 Generations it's almost non-existent amen it's like it's less than one it's it's it's um it's four what would that be 10 10 hundred a th000 10,000 yeah it's four 100s of a thousand of a thousandth four 100 four 100,000 of one amen after 20 Generations amen say why is that relevant because from Abraham to Jesus was more than double that 42 Generations right 42 generations and yet Abraham is is the is part of the firstborn family of Jesus and so was David and so was Isaiah and now you through Christ through the baptism of the Holy Ghost through the blood of Christ are en joined back to God now Abraham is your brother amen and it was 42 Generations from him to Jesus and now we've got 2,000 years worth of generations to now but I'm here to tell you that the gene that was inside of me is does not diminish and it only even took one gene from God and it didn't matter all my failures all my mistakes all my troubles how I was born whatever I did I stand here today non diminish I'm still a first child son of almighty God I'm still a part of that original generation amen it's interesting how people have that you know that star-eyed Vision you know and and and this geneticist that was talking about it he was giving a talk I was listening to and he made this point he said he said if you struggle with that he said does anyone know the first names of all four of their great great grandparents does anyone know all four names of their great great grandparents and of course Fil A stadium with 20,000 people and nobody will will hardly know that and then his next question is and does anyone care no one cares I don't know the for names of my great great grandparents and I don't care they were that was then this is now I I I I'm not worried about trying to be part of some biology I'm not worried about because sometimes you you live you say oh I want to live on and I'll be famous well you might be INF famous you might live on in infamy and I don't want to live on in infamy I want to live on in I want to be famous I want to know that God is my father and Abraham is my brother and David is my brother and Jesus is my brother H he's the first born among many Brethren and it literally trumps every possible way the devil even though I was born in sin I got recovered and even though I make mistakes I'm still a part of it even though I have failures I'm still a part of it even though I I I I have to repent every day but I'm still a part of it and I'm not any less a part of it no matter the accumul the accumulative effect of all my wrong birth and all the things I went through and all the mistakes I've made or will ever make it does not change my genealogy at all not at all so you know I I thought about that and I thought you know it's sad because you know they have and they have a lot of information about this now because they have What's called the Human Genome Project but I I was talking to brother the Mark about I said you know I said the problem is firstly is that they don't realize that they've mapped a failed system and secondly they've mapped a temporary system that's passing away I don't plan to go to heaven like this I plan to be a new creation and have a new body a body like unto his glorious body oh I'll have a body like his how about you friends a life that that a life that come on a life that doesn't carry scars and wounds and complexes a life that doesn't have grief and and failures oh I'm going to have a body like under his glorious body amen I'll be happy to see this version of me Fade Out and replaced with an everlasting one oh my I won't need anyone to come and live after me or live in my stead I I my my people people will long enjoy the works of their hands I don't need anyone to come live for me my people will long enjoy the works of their hands they won't build and another inhabit but they shall be the children of the most high God hallelujah brother brandham comes with a we we're all we're all very familiar with this statement all at once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella branam there's something calling we're all familiar with that they're in communion his last one of his last sermons his last text sermon was leadership but here he is in communion it's the last time he'll be in a pull pit and and he opens his scripture and takes and he's having a communion service and he's he's given this and and here's the context of it he says what was it he said there was another William brandham SE a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things see it was working then look up to the trees and I think Leaf I seen you fall off last year and why are you back here back there again where where'd you come from what brought you here see it was that eternal life working in the body I I now then one day as I walked on that voice talking don't never smoke drink so forth and the young fellas and all got older see there was something moving but yet all at once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles and L branam there's something calling like my little Eagle story I'm not a chicken there's something up yonder somewhere oh great Jehovah whoever you are open up I want to come home something in me calling do you have something in you calling when you say oh great Jehovah you might have been born in sin you might have winning sin to this very hour but something Burns in your heart and you want to say oh great Jehovah open to me I want to come home my something calling then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured on it then it began to grow now that old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgetfulness to Never Be Remembered against me no more now we stand Justified as though we had never sinned in the presence of God in the presence of God that's how you stand am I I saw and I I hate to keep going down sidetracks and I might not get through with this and we might have a tenth installment but is it okay yeah amen I I I've got I can't pass things when the Lord quickens it to me and I didn't put this in my notes but I thought if I remember it if the Lord brings it to me I'm going to tell it I you know he says here you know in the presence of God we stand Justified as though we never sinned in the presence of God and I I saw recently uh a reel that some church put out and it was wonderful it be make a great skit where there was a whole group of people in a line coming up and they were coming up to the Pearly Gates and there's one supposed you know I guess an angel whatever and he's standing there looking through the record and they come up with all of this it reminds me of Matthew 25 and they're going to say well we did this and we did that and we did this in your name we preach the gospel we did all these Mighty works and he's going to say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you and one after one they're coming up and say and they'll say well I I I went to church um well the next one comes up but I it was my mother's Church well I I did all kinds of good deeds in the in the earth step on the scale and they step on the scale and one right after another everybody has to step on the scale they get weighed Paul warned the world that would happen yes amen we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ and give an account of our Deeds whether good or bad the only way you escape that judgment is to be seated on the throne with Christ see and that's why the Bible says that that that what you want to be is the man whose sins go before for you and that way when you get there they're already taken care of you've already been adjudicated and you're you're good take your place on the throne what you don't want to be is the man who got there and your sins followed some men sins follow them and then you got to answer you got to give an account for what you did or didn't do and every person was coming up well you know I I I never lied and I never cheated and I step on the scale sir step on the scale and step on the scale go sorry and then Here Comes Here Comes some person and says well I I uh sir I don't even know I I really can't think of anything good that I did I uh but and then suddenly Jesus steps up and the angel when when the person portraying Jesus got Jesus written here and the person steps up and and the angel goes sir you're going to have to oh oh I'm sorry I didn't know I didn't know you were with him uh step on the scale please and the young man goes to get on scale no not you him and Jesus stepped on the scale ding ding ding ding ding ding D ding ding enter into the joys of the Lord and they go walking off oh friends that's what I want to be I want to know that he took my place I want to know I'm not going to have to stand on the scale I'm going to hear but if if if I show up with him and he has stepped on the scale for me now brother brandham backs up and I'm quickly running out of time so I want to go through these quotes because I I I want to come to a final quote where it is so uh complete that it is everything I've been trying to preach for nine sessions nine installments of this series and if I'd never have to preach another sermon in my life and you never see brother Jason on this side again this last quote I'm going to read it's two two screens it's one quote last two screens from leadership it should give you everything you need to get home and see me again so brother brandham comes now he's going to drop back and he's going to start breaking some of this down and I'm G to have to I can't I know I can't stop and preach on it but watch he comes from 1951 look deity I'm a part of Charles Brandon because I was born from Charlie brandham my Daddy I'm a part of him I got a forehead like him my hair was like him I'm a small man like him I'm in the ner n nature like him because he's my dad and if we become in spirit sons of God deity dwells in the man don't you love a hillbilly explanation amen my I love this there's no Greek words in that no Hebrew no apologetics you don't need to uh it's just straight forward that's sassr good stuff there's Honey in the Rock my brother then you talk about blind eyes being open see now this is Christ being able to work through you you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing impossible to God God said nothing impossible with you if you believe not with you if you'll believe not with God but you deity is is in man the very God that I love this statement the very God that stood back there on the mystical platform of the eternities and rolled worlds off his hands and created these things give you the privilege to be his son and you're a part of him isn't that beautiful and God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity Hallelujah there you are might choke you but study over that a little while God dwells in man and man becomes a Son of God not in himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God the Creator lives in the creation you see the difference between this and Mormonism Mormonism takes you to actually become God and brother Bram starts saying the man is Divine but then he he's going to he's going to focus the lens further and he's going to show you this is not Mormon teaching because now he goes on to say the man becomes a Son of God not in himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God the Creator lives in the creation you with me he goes on finally in this sermon oh my how I love that then stand with then stand with an unwavering faith and ask what you will and it'll be done unto you there he is God there he is it's God dwelling in you and you surrendered to him and then you ask what you will CU it won't be you asking or even thinking what to ask or speaking it'll be God because you are abiding with Christ and Christ with you and then you will ask what you will that's what Jesus said right after he said abide amen good see so this is the very thing we've been trying to get across you now he's going to come forward that's 1951 here's 1956 so now he's going to go to the Jordan where John is baptizing watch and John said I suddenly don't hear myself anymore brother to switch me to the pull pit mic if you need to and John said I bear record seeing the spirit of God like a dove this is going to help you to understand how Jesus was completely a man but completely God I bear record seeing the spirit of God like a dove coming down and abiding on him Hallelujah there you are the Dove and the lamb United together that's when God and man became one that's when Heaven and Earth embraced each other Hallelujah that's when God was made flesh brought it that's when let me move this screen that um that's when God was made flesh brought it that's when God came down from the spirit form and was made a man and dwelt Among Us that's when all eternities embraced each other that's when the human Fallen race of Adam's people and Jehovah God and every Angel come together when God and man was made one on that great Memorial Day when John baptized Jesus see so so prior to his baptism he lived as a as a man and now he didn't need the Holy Ghost to give him a new birth he didn't come Fallen but it came to empower his ministry so they could go forward and it and it was the embracing of Heaven and Earth in a single man and now God brother random said it's so simple God dwelt in a man called Jesus Christ see all right the perfect now he comes to the Masterpiece oh this gets good the Masterpiece let me see if I'm uh still in line I am good The Perfect Image the God man God in morphe had changed from Supernatural to the vision and the vision was projected into the image and the image was smitten so that the Supernatural could taste the feeling of death God's perfect Masterpiece is that easy Jesus was the image of God see the express image the Bible calls him so he says he could not do it in Moses he could not do it in the prophets Isaiah who was sawed with saws till he sawed to Pieces he could not do it in the prophets that were stoned he could not do it because he couldn't feel it there was just a portion of him speaking of those great prophets there's just a portion of him but in this perfect Masterpiece he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he could not only project Moses he could project his entire being into this person and taste death for the whole human race God's perfect Masterpiece this blows trinitarianism out of the water God's perfect Masterpiece God so inspired by seeing it he become a redeemer of all ages to speak for those in the back grounds who had been before and now all promises was met in him he was the Perfection of the Perfection all types was fulfilled in him our kinsman redeemer in Ruth and Boaz our lawgiver from Mount SII our Prophet from the Wilderness as he come from the mountain as he come from the Wilderness as he come from eternity and became man The Perfect Image hallelujah amen the Perfect Image see so so you know oh no I can't I can't I can't I want to finish these quotes we'll have to maybe make that a next a next installment let me keep going 1965 God's only provided place of worship I stood Yonder in Los Angeles at Forest Lawn one day there is a statue of Moses by Michelangelo that great something in that sculpture that Vision that he had of what Moses ought to be with was only portraying and type of the great father God and he had in his heart before the foundation of the world a son because he's a father so he's he's saying like like Michelangelo had something inside him that had to get out by expression and so he crafted with tools he built he built a body and he was so inspired because of the vision I'm just taking a sidebar he got so inspired from the vision that he took his hammer and smote it and said the most illogical thing that him a man of science should know better speak which was ridiculous it's Stone but that's how inspired he got because he saw an inward Vision imagine how inspired God get God was when he saw Christ willing to say not my will thine be done imagine how inspired he is for you brothers and sisters teenagers married single when you would say not my will Lord I don't want this world I want you I want your image I want my whole life to be an image of you something you can be proud of something you can walk through and live through and talk through and the and and and so brother Brenham says when he struck it on the knee a piece flew off and he said you can even put your hand in the indention where he hid it and they they portrayed it like a tragedy oh man this was a a perfect Masterpiece but he's he HIIT it and it and now it's marred but brother brandham because this is the way prophets would think brother brandham said well to me the the marring is what made it a masterpiece and I because that's what made Jesus a masterpiece that he was marred and see and it showed there was a sacrifice it showed that someone paid a price for me paid a price for you and I thought I remember way back in the day I was just a young preacher and that stirred up my heart and I thought that's exactly right because if if if he's the Masterpiece it means and a piece flew off and that's me I came from him and I'm a peace and he's the master peace Hallelujah he's the master to all the pieces and I'm part of him and I was in him and I came from him and I'm going back to him and there's going to be a whole Kingdom of him oh my oh you're guaranteed friends when you when you follow this message you're guaranteed to hear things you don't hear in the average Sunday morning pull pit Oh Glory to God Amen so he goes on he says so I I just had to I just had to blow that out he had in his heart before the foundation of the world a son because he's a father but it was still in the genes of his word and he created a man and he had to put him on free moral agency but that man fell but the great sculptor God who made man from the dust of the earth he didn't settle for that he started making man again I don't have it here today on this quote on these quotes but brother brandom oh it's so grips it tears the heart out of me it fills me with inspiration and brother brandham says when when he saw oh my when he saw his great creation Adam and his bride and a garden and God had made it perfect and it was beautiful and it was Flawless and he said when he saw his Masterpiece laying face down in ruin he said he did not throw it away he started over he said because he's God and he won't be defeated I'm so glad today I can't defeat him you can't defeat him Hallelujah I'm part of his Heritage and there's not enough devils in hell to stop me from being rebuilt Into His Image Hallelujah yes sir and he says he oh I got to get past this quote my goodness he had to put it on free moral agency but that man fell but the great sculptor God who made man from the dust of the earth he didn't settle for that he started making man again and he made a Noah he died drunk he made a Moses imagine this he made a Moses that failed to keep his word he made prophets that run in the time of trouble and he kept building and molding until after a while he wanted a masterpiece to reflect him his nature that was in his heart what a son should be on one day down on Jordan after that Masterpiece had been formed and made here he come descending down on the wings of a dove and said this is him he was so enthused with this masterpiece until he struck him on Calvary that he would die for the rest of us that's imperfect that through the shedding of his blood he might bring many masterpieces being his bride to his son we who were imperfect come on we who were imperfect he traded the a perfect for the imperfect oh Hallelujah Masterpiece is scarred because of the enthusiasm of God to see such a masterpiece he struck him for us all see there he died to perfect we who are say it with me imperfect read it again he died to perfect we who are imperfect there's no denominational mixture in it anywhere my house my children born of my genes amen glory to God my genes are in them I will put my word in them I'll write them upon the tables of their heart that's my family the family of the body of Jesus Christ the family are you the family of the body of Jesus Christ then if we are brother brandham said if you found he said he talked about the old back in slavery days and the one that they didn't have to drive him at all he worked because he realized way across the ocean he was a son of a king and though he was captive against his will he conducted himself like a King's son do you realize that you're part of the body of Jesus Christ you're the family of almighty God we should conduct ourselves so amen do you believe that will you accept that will you accept that that's what abiding in Christ is all about amen it's not just it's not just it's not just you who came to him weary and heavy laden it's you who have been willing since that day to learn of him it's you who have been willing to take his yoke upon you or not but if you have been then you have gone to a next level of rest where you can say to this mountain because it's actually him speaking through you because you're the body of Jesus Christ you're part of the family by a gene of God I'll give you this one finally and we're going to go home here it is I told you if these last two screens it's one quote I just had to put it on two screens so you could see it I I could this could be the last words out of my mouth in a pull pit and I could face God and sayl I gave it my best and I I sh not to declare unto them the whole Council of God leadership 1965 what a rebuke to Christianity we're supposed to represent God and eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God he alone has eternal life and we are products of his because we're genes of his spirit it then we should conduct ourselves women and men like the Bible said for us to do not Jezebels of the street and Ricky of the organization but Christian gentlemen Sons and Daughters of God born of the spirit of God manifesting the light in our days and scattering it that's exactly right I'm glad he put those last three words there so it can never be challenged that's exactly right he thought about what he said and he said yep that's exactly righten that we should conduct ourself women and men like the Bible said for us to do not Jezebels of the street and Ricky of the organization but Christian gentlemen Sons and Daughters of God born of the spirit of God manifesting the light in our days and scattering it that's exactly right stand come brother Tony bring your team because he lives brother Andrew is on my heart Because He Lives I Can Face tomorrow so we will we'll carry on uh I told you not to get your hopes up or I said something like that amen at least I got through all of my quotes and I got through all of them but I sure had a bunch of rabbit Trails I would have liked to have went down it's all good you love the Lord you know by now friends nine installments later you should really have a clear understanding of that next level of rest that the Lord is calling us to I have proven to you that that's going to be the Avenue through which the third pole operates and you're you're going to want to make sure that that third pole is operating in you because that's the spoken word see that's and and and that and that that it it's even at a level in the day and hour that you and I live in we were talking about this a couple installments ago where brother randam said it won't be used in a big way you remember that and we were kind of like wait what you you created animals out of thin air by speaking and that's not a big way you resurrected an animal by speaking you disappeared a tumor by speaking you rebuked a blizzard and Storm by speaking you gave a mother her children in Salvation by speaking and that's not a big way and we said then I don't know how it'll all work out but I I I don't know what it'll all look like I don't know what even tomorrow holds I just know the word is true and I believe it and whatever it comes I want to be ready in whatever way it happens I want to be abiding in him I don't want to have to hurry up and get to an abiding level so that so that everything starts going you know Helter Skelter around me and I've got no effective energy or power to do anything about it tragedy strikes my home my family my loved ones my business whatever and I've got no effective energy and I got to go quickly and figure out brother Jason what how how was it I abide how was I give me give me a bullet list brother I I give you nine sermons on it think about how necessary it is for you to have the spoken word I mean if for no other reason we're the age that's going to cross into a millennium and we're going to have to rebuild the entire world by the spoken word that's going to be third pull that's going to be the spoken word and God has sent it and the prophet said talks about a squeeze and talks about these things say oh it's squeezing it's it doesn't need to get more does it need to get worse and I said to you last time however bad you think the squeeze is it could become 10 times worse by tomorrow by tomorrow you don't know things are happening so rapidly you can hardly stay a breast of it and things lining up in such a way that we never thought we would see and yet we're seeing it and it's astonishing I just want to be ready I want to say that because he lives whatever tomorrow is I can face it now that doesn't just mean get through it means I can be victorious amen is that your desire sing it with me now before we go because he lives Because He Lives oh lift it up oh tomorrow and every day afterward he Liv all fear all is God because I know oh yes oh he holds my fut now is worth the Liv oh come on lift it up let me oh he Liv I can face Tom whatever tomorrow brings we can face it be because he lives said
