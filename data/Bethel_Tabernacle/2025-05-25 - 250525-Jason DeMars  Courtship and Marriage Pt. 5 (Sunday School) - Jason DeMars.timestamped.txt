[7:07] Christians
[7:10] into that direction in that way. And
[7:13] again, I'll repeat it. Fathers are the
[7:16] gatekeeper.
[7:18] Fathers are the ones that either they
[7:21] remove themselves and they do nothing.
[7:24] Doing nothing is doing something. It's
[7:27] ruining your family.
[7:29] It's damaging your family. It's a It's
[7:31] allowing the If you were a farmer and
[7:34] you had a field and you just said,
[7:36] "Well, it's up to God to take care of
[7:38] the field." They would probably say,
[7:42] "There's something wrong with his head.
[7:45] Let's get him an examination." It takes
[7:47] work. It takes effort. It takes That's
[7:50] what redemption is. It takes work. It
[7:52] takes effort. We want to see redemption
[7:55] in our family. We want to re see
[7:57] redemption in our home. It takes effort.
[8:01] It takes fighting. It takes battling.
[8:04] And so, fathers are the the ones that
[8:06] are to establish this in their home. You
[8:09] don't just sit back and hope. A farmer
[8:11] doesn't just sit back and hope. A
[8:14] shepherd doesn't just sit back and hope.
[8:19] He uses all his strength,
[8:21] all his efforts
[8:24] to stand in the gap.
[8:27] That's that's our job as fathers and
[8:30] mother is to be a helper in that. You
[8:33] didn't think that I'd be speaking to the
[8:34] fathers and mothers so much when I was
[8:36] talking about courtship, but that's
[8:38] because maybe we're we're not looking at
[8:40] it right.
[8:42] The young people are not the drivers of
[8:45] this process, and they shouldn't be.
[8:48] They're a part of it. They participate
[8:50] in it. They're they're actively seeking
[8:53] the will and the mind of the Lord. But
[8:56] it's not without parents being involved.
[9:00] It's never designed to be that way. And
[9:04] if there's resistance, fathers, maybe
[9:07] you didn't start it young enough so that
[9:09] it isn't normal in your children's heads
[9:12] and now there's resistance. Maybe
[9:13] there's resistance from mom and the
[9:15] children.
[9:17] Well, do you have any muscles?
[9:20] Do you have any spiritual muscles?
[9:23] You'll have to take a stand. It won't be
[9:24] easy. You'll have to pray about it.
[9:27] You'll have to use wisdom. You don't use
[9:29] you don't use force,
[9:31] but you use the strength that God has
[9:33] given you to make sure that these
[9:34] standards are taught with love, with
[9:38] patience, and that that they're
[9:40] followed.
[9:42] I can't do it. There's already this.
[9:44] There's already that. With God all
[9:47] things are possible.
[9:49] That's not that's not just a statement
[9:51] for things that are outside of your
[9:53] control. Actually, it's more in a
[9:55] statement if because Paul went when Paul
[9:57] says, "I can do all things through
[9:58] Christ who gives me strength." Is he
[10:01] doing all he was able to do all things?
[10:03] In other words, he was able to if you
[10:05] look at it, it has nothing to do with
[10:07] football or soccer
[10:09] uh that people quote this verse. What
[10:13] does it say? I know how to both abound
[10:16] and to be abased. I know how to live
[10:18] with riches. I know how to live in
[10:20] poverty and be content either way. So
[10:24] when when we're looking at this as men
[10:27] with God's help and with God's strength,
[10:31] we can establish this at any time and
[10:34] any place in our home because God calls
[10:36] us to redeem that which is lost. We are
[10:41] to be his hands and feet towards
[10:43] redemption.
[10:45] All right, with that said, let's go to
[10:47] the scripture.
[10:50] So, as we looked at before, headship
[10:52] means the decision maker, husband and
[10:54] father can invalidate any decision his
[10:57] wife or daughter makes. Uh, and there's
[10:59] no also talked about this, there's no
[11:02] intermediate state between head the
[11:04] headship of a father and the headship of
[11:06] a husband. In America, we have this
[11:09] state. you you you turn 18, you don't
[11:11] got to listen to anybody anymore. Not if
[11:14] you're a Christian.
[11:16] Not if you're a Christian young lady,
[11:17] you're you're in that position of being
[11:20] under headship. A woman is always under
[11:22] headship unless she's a widow.
[11:25] Yeah.
[11:27] Deuteronomy 22:13, if any man take a
[11:31] wife. And so we're looking at this verse
[11:33] and it's strange and shocking. And we'll
[11:37] be looking at several passages that are
[11:40] strange and shocking to our Western
[11:43] um mind mind frame and our our Puritan
[11:48] heritage. So let's let's just bear with
[11:52] the Bible for a little bit. You're going
[11:54] to I was going to say bear with JD a
[11:56] little bit, but let's just I'll put it
[11:57] off on the Bible because wasn't my idea.
[12:03] Deuteronomy 22:13. If any man take a
[12:05] wife and go in unto her and hate her,
[12:08] and give occasions of speech against
[12:10] her, and bring up an evil name upon her,
[12:12] and say, I took this woman, and when I
[12:15] came to her, I found her not a maid or a
[12:17] virgin.
[12:19] Then shall the father of the damsel and
[12:21] her mother take and bring forth the
[12:22] token tokens of the damsel's virginity
[12:26] unto the elders of the city and the
[12:28] gate. And the damsel's father shall say
[12:31] unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto
[12:33] this man to wife, and he hateth her.
[12:40] And lo, he has given occasions of speech
[12:42] against her, saying, I found not thy
[12:44] daughter a maid. And yet these are the
[12:46] tokens of my daughter's virginity, and
[12:48] they shall spread the cloth before the
[12:50] elders of the city, and the elders that
[12:53] of that city shall take the man and
[12:55] chastise him. So you see what a serious
[12:58] accusation is. So in Israel, we're
[13:02] looking at this verse. We're going to
[13:03] look at another verse. In Israel, what
[13:05] was God trying to do and establish? He
[13:08] was trying to establish that being pure,
[13:12] being a virgin
[13:14] was of a high value.
[13:16] Amen.
[13:18] And an accusation. This woman's not a
[13:21] virgin. This was an accusation against
[13:24] the parents, right? Because it's their
[13:28] duty to bring that girl up in purity and
[13:32] to deliver her as a virgin to her
[13:34] husband, right? That's the duty. that
[13:38] that's the duty that's put upon the
[13:41] parents
[13:42] and so it's an important duty and God is
[13:44] looking at this whole picture and wants
[13:46] to emphasize how critical and important
[13:50] this uh purity and virginity is.
[13:57] So the elders of that city if if it's if
[13:59] the accusation
[14:02] basically if you want to look at it in a
[14:03] big picture they're they're the man is
[14:06] accusing the do the the girl and her
[14:09] parents of virginity fraud.
[14:13] You've committed fraud against me. You
[14:16] you said that this was a virgin daughter
[14:18] of Israel. She's not. You've lied to me.
[14:22] And here she makes the accusation. If
[14:27] there's proof, they put forth the proof.
[14:30] And what what happens is even the the
[14:33] the head men of the city, the city
[14:35] council of elders gets involved and they
[14:40] chastise him. You know what that means?
[14:41] They don't go,
[14:44] "You jerk." They beat him.
[14:47] He gets beaten in public in front of
[14:51] everyone. Amen.
[14:52] For making this accusation because it's
[14:54] such a serious one
[14:57] in in in our world, in our society. It
[15:00] hardly
[15:01] people hardly bat an eye at it. It's not
[15:03] that important. It's not significant. As
[15:06] Christians, this is the word.
[15:08] We look at this as a very critically
[15:11] important thing that we as fathers and
[15:14] as mothers have a duty to teach. And
[15:17] it's not just teaching and hoping, but
[15:20] it's verifying. It's watching the
[15:23] atmosphere. It's watching the type of
[15:25] friends
[15:26] and people that they're around. Right?
[15:30] Uh bad company corrupts good morals.
[15:32] We're watching for we're being watchful.
[15:35] We're being mindful. We're making sure
[15:36] that the atmosphere that our children
[15:39] are in is the right atmosphere.
[15:41] Right? Because the wrong atmosphere will
[15:43] produce the wrong results. the right
[15:46] atmosphere
[15:47] will produce the right right results.
[15:50] Amen.
[15:51] So, we're being watchful and mindful all
[15:53] of the all of this because we have a
[15:55] duty to produce children
[16:00] that are born again
[16:03] but that are pure.
[16:06] All right.
[16:10] And the elders of that city shall take
[16:11] that man and chastise him, and they
[16:13] shall immerse him in a hund shekels of
[16:15] silver, and give them unto the father of
[16:17] the damsel, because he's brought up an
[16:19] evil name upon a virgin of Israel, and
[16:21] she shall be his wife. He may not put
[16:23] her away all his days. I'm not really
[16:25] sure. I didn't I didn't do the research
[16:28] on
[16:29] what what amount a hundred shekels of
[16:32] silver would actually be. But if you
[16:34] begin to look at what some of these
[16:36] fines are in the Bible, they're very
[16:38] significant. They're not $5. They're not
[16:41] even a thousand dollars. They're tens of
[16:43] thousands of dollars in in in in modern
[16:47] money. And so these this is a very
[16:50] significant thing that
[16:54] she not only because he has brought an
[16:55] evil name upon a virgin of Israel and
[16:57] she shall be his wife, he may not put
[16:59] her away all his days. If you look at
[17:01] the Old Testament, there's other
[17:03] situations and circumstances where he
[17:06] could put her away, right? For the
[17:08] hardness of their hearts, Jesus said,
[17:11] "Moses gave you that authority." But
[17:14] from the beginning, it wasn't so.
[17:16] So in this case, because of that false
[17:18] accusation, every other reason is put
[17:20] away. He cannot divorce her. Not only
[17:24] that, but he has to pay a very
[17:26] significant fine to her father. Again,
[17:30] what is God pointing out? The
[17:31] responsibility of a father. The
[17:34] responsibility of a father. And if this
[17:36] evil accusation, the evil accusation is
[17:39] not just against the girl. It's against
[17:41] her father because you're accusing him
[17:44] of committing fraud.
[17:47] All right.
[17:53] So, the daughter is held
[17:55] uh I think I'm missing some verses here.
[17:59] Are they next? No.
[18:03] All right. So, let me just take that
[18:05] back. Um,
[18:10] okay. I have them here. Verse 20 says in
[18:13] Deuteronomy 22:20, "But if this thing be
[18:16] true, and the tokens of virginity be not
[18:18] found for the damsel, then they shall
[18:22] bring out the damsel to the door of her
[18:24] father's house, and the men of her city
[18:27] shall stone her with stones that she
[18:28] died because she has wrought folly in
[18:30] Israel to play the in her father's
[18:33] house. So shalt thou put evil away from
[18:37] among you."
[18:38] So you see there, the Lord holds the
[18:42] daughter guilty. She committed virginity
[18:45] fraud and she's guilty. She's literally
[18:49] put to death. But where is she put to
[18:51] death? At the door of her father's
[18:54] house. Why at the door of her father's
[18:56] house? Because her father didn't ensure
[19:01] the purity of his daughter. It's it's
[19:04] awful. It's horrible. But this is the
[19:06] horror. and wickedness of sin when a man
[19:10] would just imagine yourself in that
[19:13] position that you didn't deliver your
[19:16] daughter as a virgin. You failed to
[19:20] protect her. You failed to keep her in
[19:22] the right atmosphere. You failed to
[19:25] teach her. And here you you deliver her
[19:28] and she's guilty. What do you do? Your
[19:31] your precious daughter is brought to
[19:33] your door and they stone her with
[19:35] stones. And whose fault is that?
[19:39] Amen.
[19:40] It's it's your fault. It's her it's her
[19:42] guilt, but it's your fault for cause
[19:45] being the cause of it.
[19:48] So, how many knows what the three sacred
[19:52] virtues are?
[19:56] So, if you're
[19:58] if you're parents,
[20:01] you need to you need to get this written
[20:03] down. You need to get a good
[20:05] understanding of this because it's
[20:06] brother Brandham says it's what we need
[20:08] to be be teaching our families. Every
[20:12] every woman is given three sacred
[20:15] virtues.
[20:18] And it's again it's the duty of us as
[20:21] fathers and as mothers to deliver this
[20:25] teaching to our children so that they
[20:26] know do our daughters know what the s
[20:29] three sacred virtues are. Do they
[20:32] understand what their responsibility is
[20:34] before God?
[20:37] And this is from uh invisible union I
[20:40] believe. No, not invisible union.
[20:42] Choosing of a bride that brother
[20:43] Brandham talks about it. Three sacred
[20:46] virtues.
[20:47] One is your body. It's to keep your body
[20:50] pure. Two, it's your virtue.
[20:53] Speaks of strength. In other words, your
[20:55] ability to say yes or no. Three is your
[20:58] womanhood. your character and contact to
[21:01] your children and to your husband. These
[21:05] are the three sacred virtues that these
[21:06] are the things that God will hold.
[21:08] Brother Brandham says God will hold our
[21:11] sisters accountable, women accountable
[21:14] for how uh they handled these three
[21:17] things, these three sacred virtues.
[21:20] Let's keep going. Exodus 22:16.
[21:24] And if a man entice a maid that is not
[21:26] betrothed and lie with her, he shall
[21:28] surely endow her to be his wife. If her
[21:33] father utterly refused to give her unto
[21:35] him, he shall pay money according to the
[21:37] dowy of virgins.
[21:41] And so we see the Bible shows us fathers
[21:44] actually have genuine authority to make
[21:47] decisions
[21:49] for their daughter's marriage.
[21:52] Right? It it's not just a mock
[21:54] authority. It's not just a uh uh
[21:58] formality as we basically have it in our
[22:02] modern society. But in the Bible, the
[22:04] father can utterly refuse. So here we
[22:08] have a situation where a man entices a
[22:12] maid and he lies with her. He's under
[22:14] obligation. Now again the purpose of
[22:18] these laws is not necessarily the sense
[22:22] that um
[22:26] God wants to enact them right he wants
[22:29] to make these things difficult the
[22:32] purpose is there is a protection that
[22:34] he's putting there he's saying okay you
[22:37] want to become one flesh with some girl
[22:40] you're under obligation now
[22:44] you're obligated
[22:45] to provide for her. Now you're obligated
[22:48] to provide a home. Now you're obligated
[22:50] to provide for children if any children
[22:53] should come. You're under obligation
[22:55] before God to be a man of honor to take
[22:59] care of what you're you're doing. But
[23:01] the father still even in that situation
[23:06] he still has the right to say no I won't
[23:09] I won't give her to you. Of course, this
[23:12] would be a very very difficult thing for
[23:14] her in in the nation of Israel because
[23:17] of the value that they would place upon
[23:20] a virgin daughter. And so this is a very
[23:23] difficult thing. But I guess if the man
[23:25] is a son son of Bell, you probably
[23:29] wouldn't want to give him. And the
[23:31] evidence is probably pretty good that he
[23:33] is a son of bleial because he's
[23:36] defrauded physically defrauded your
[23:38] daughter without any commitment without
[23:42] taking asking authority to be joined in
[23:45] marriage from the father.
[23:49] And so what is what is his punishment?
[23:51] And you notice here is it's not
[23:53] execution. It's not a death sentence in
[23:57] this situation. But what it what is it?
[24:00] He shall pay the money according to the
[24:02] dowy of virgins. I was looking at this
[24:04] and the the amount could vary, but you
[24:07] could see it as anywhere between 30 and
[24:09] $50,000.
[24:11] So, it's a very significant amount of
[24:13] money that is placed upon this thing.
[24:16] This is this is a very very heavy fine.
[24:21] And and so whether he gets the girl or
[24:24] not to marry her, he has to pay it.
[24:27] Yeah.
[24:28] one way or the other. All right. And so
[24:32] as we looked, Time is short.
[24:36] I'm going to try to
[24:39] try to get through this. It's a good
[24:41] good place to finish if I can do it in
[24:44] five minutes. So once again, the Bible
[24:48] gives genuine authority to fathers to
[24:51] make decisions about the love life of
[24:54] their daughters. Right now, a wise
[24:58] father, of course, is going to have his
[25:01] daughter involved. It's not simply going
[25:02] to be an arranged marriage, though.
[25:04] There are places in the world where
[25:06] message believers certainly do it that
[25:08] way, and that's a normal thing. That's
[25:11] okay. In our culture, it's not done that
[25:12] way. And the Bible doesn't force us into
[25:15] that place. But the Bible does bring the
[25:18] principle of headship and decision
[25:21] making across the board. Yeah.
[25:23] And so, you know, if there's no if
[25:26] there's no leading of the Lord from your
[25:29] daughter, you're not going to force her
[25:31] into getting married to someone she
[25:32] doesn't like at all. Right? And so, as
[25:37] for as a young man, you're you're also
[25:39] not just out of nowhere now. It's like,
[25:41] hey, the pressure is off me. I can just
[25:43] go start asking all kinds of dads about
[25:45] this. I don't even have to talk to the
[25:47] girl anymore. As tempting as that as
[25:50] that is for some young men, probably
[25:52] would have been tempted uh for me that
[25:55] way. But as tempting is because as
[25:57] brother Brandham said, I don't like
[25:58] talking to a girl. I never did like
[26:00] talking to a girl when I was growing up.
[26:02] I was always afraid of them. Now I I got
[26:05] a house full of them.
[26:09] Guess the Lord was intent on delivering
[26:11] me
[26:13] of fear. So,
[26:17] but you know, you're you're you're
[26:19] making a con as a young man. Number one
[26:22] is you're ready to be a provider,
[26:25] right?
[26:25] Or you're in the process of preparation
[26:28] to be a provider. You're not 13 years
[26:30] old living at your mom and dad's house
[26:32] and playing video games in the dark,
[26:34] right? You're not ready to be a husband.
[26:38] You don't you don't have a job. You're
[26:40] not ready to provide. You can't get a
[26:41] home. You're you're not in that
[26:43] position. So, someone that is ready, you
[26:46] you you you you're meet a young lady,
[26:48] you're speaking to her, and you you
[26:50] think, "Maybe I have the leading of the
[26:52] Lord here. I'm going to pray." You seek
[26:54] the mind of the Lord
[26:56] in through this process. As a young
[26:58] lady, you're not out there throwing
[27:01] yourself in the message version of doing
[27:03] that before young men trying to get
[27:07] response from all of them. You're
[27:09] waiting on the Lord. You're trusting God
[27:11] for send to send you the right one in
[27:13] the right time. But as a young man, you
[27:16] look, you're discerning the the mind of
[27:18] the Lord. And none of these decisions
[27:20] should be made in a vacuum. You
[27:22] shouldn't make the decision on your own.
[27:25] You as a as a young man, you have
[27:27] parents, you have a pastor. Seek wisdom.
[27:31] In the multitude of counselors, there's
[27:33] safety. Seek wisdom. Am I ready? That's
[27:36] a question you should ask your your mom
[27:38] and dad. Not I like this girl. I want to
[27:42] talk to her. You need to be ready to
[27:45] because the purpose of courtship is
[27:48] what? Fun.
[27:52] That's a that's a a side thing. The
[27:55] purpose of courtship is discerning the
[27:57] will of the Lord for marriage, right?
[28:00] And so as a as a young lady, you're you
[28:02] you you get the question asked of you
[28:05] from your dad because a young man has
[28:06] approached your dad and you your dad
[28:09] should come to you come to you and you
[28:11] speak together about it and you pray and
[28:14] seek the mind of the Lord together about
[28:16] it. Do you want to take the next step?
[28:18] Do you want to go towards courtship? Do
[28:20] you want to discern the will of the
[28:21] Lord? She might say no way. Well, she's
[28:24] protected. She doesn't have to say no
[28:26] way. dad gets the wonderful opportunity
[28:32] to tell a young man, "No, no, I don't
[28:35] believe that's the will of the Lord."
[28:38] And so, you know, this this whole
[28:40] process is not to be made uh without
[28:44] advice, without wisdom from your pastor,
[28:48] your parents, and those that you trust.
[28:52] It's not a it's not a matter that we run
[28:54] into with our hormones ablaze,
[28:59] right? Of course, that's part of it. God
[29:01] designed us that way for a purpose. And
[29:04] yet, we do it the biblical way. We seek
[29:08] as young men, you seek counsel. You seek
[29:10] wisdom. You understand? Well, you go and
[29:13] talk to your dad. You're not ready. But
[29:14] dude, what are you talking about?
[29:17] Okay. So, what do I need to do, Dad?
[29:19] What steps do I need to take to make
[29:21] myself ready? Same thing, young lady.
[29:23] Maybe a boy approaches and dad has to
[29:26] right away say she she's not ready for
[29:28] that. You know, you you you need to
[29:31] understand first, do you have the Holy
[29:33] Ghost? Never should go into marriage in
[29:37] a position where you're not born born of
[29:39] the spirit of God. That's a disaster
[29:42] waiting to happen. And so, I'm going to
[29:44] have to close there. Let's stand and
[29:46] pray.
