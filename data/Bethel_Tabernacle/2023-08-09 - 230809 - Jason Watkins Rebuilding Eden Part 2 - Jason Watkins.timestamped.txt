[29:27] amen I hope you enjoyed Sunday my
[29:30] goodness I enjoyed it wow I enjoyed
[29:32] delivering that and so I was able to
[29:35] figure out what I think I can get to
[29:38] tonight we'll the Lord willing unless
[29:40] the Rapture comes we will be trying to
[29:43] go into part three on Sunday but I I
[29:46] have this very one wonderful part here
[29:49] that's really close to my heart it
[29:50] really dealt with me as I was
[29:52] ministering it amen so I should be able
[29:54] to get through it
[29:56] got all my crying out today so I
[29:58] shouldn't be able just to preach amen
[30:00] praise the Lord Saint John chapter one
[30:03] just like we did last time on last
[30:05] Sunday we just won a single verse last
[30:08] Sunday remember we read Genesis one and
[30:11] two and we're going to take today John 1
[30:15] and 1.
[30:17] in the beginning was the word
[30:21] and the Word was with God and the Word
[30:24] was God that is a beautiful passage in
[30:29] the Bible amen let's pray
[30:32] father we thank you for this Gathering
[30:34] of saints tonight Lord we thank you for
[30:36] all of the singing and the specials Lord
[30:39] and just shortly Lord just a little
[30:42] thought on my heart tonight to bridge uh
[30:45] the two Sunday Services Lord and I I
[30:49] pray for your blessing now upon speaker
[30:52] and upon hearer Lord we continue to
[30:55] remember our numerous families that are
[30:57] traveling away may you be with them
[31:00] Father keep them safe join them back to
[31:02] us at your appointed hour amen we commit
[31:06] ourselves into your hands for this word
[31:07] tonight now Lord we committed all to you
[31:10] in Jesus name amen God bless friends you
[31:13] can be seated
[31:20] I was um
[31:22] today
[31:24] went actually went in two days early my
[31:27] follow-up appointment
[31:29] to have my eye looked at it again was
[31:33] actually Friday but when I got up this
[31:35] morning it seemed rather worse and so I
[31:38] went and the report was mixed certain
[31:41] parts of it have improved other parts of
[31:43] it have worsened and she said it's just
[31:46] like that that shingles in the eye is
[31:48] extremely hard to treat hard to get rid
[31:51] of completely and it's hard to treat
[31:53] because that
[31:56] that in one way the thing they used to
[31:58] go after the virus is a totally
[32:01] different thing than what they do to go
[32:03] after what the virus does to your eye
[32:05] the pressure and the swelling and the
[32:07] irritation and so in treating one it
[32:11] helps the other and if they don't do
[32:12] that then the other one has a problem
[32:14] and so she said it's a real balancing
[32:16] act so
[32:18] um amen she dilated my eye I was in
[32:21] quite a bit of discomfort so while that
[32:24] discomfort has gone these lights here
[32:25] are really tough tough so amen praise
[32:29] the Lord if I'm looking away constantly
[32:31] you'll know what it is I'm not worried
[32:33] about it the devil's still a liar
[32:35] straight up that's it he's a liar
[32:37] nothing more to say he's a liar
[32:40] man amen so he he don't run nothing but
[32:43] his mouth anyway
[32:44] so amen he certainly don't run God's
[32:48] kingdom he don't run God's family he
[32:49] don't run me amen praise the Lord and so
[32:55] I want then to carry on tonight if
[32:57] you'll remember just to recap the very
[32:59] last point we were making Sunday so that
[33:03] I can try to make the bridge here for
[33:05] this coming Sunday but we finished up
[33:08] where we were showing you how that it
[33:11] was the devil's Unholy spirit that had
[33:15] caused the church to go into error but
[33:18] brother Branham was showing us that now
[33:21] he starts coming back now to seed time
[33:24] uh from Eden and here it is again so
[33:28] brother Branham was showing us that that
[33:30] God is restoring Eden condition now
[33:34] that's a beautiful thought friends
[33:35] because it's not just that he's
[33:38] rebuilding the Earth he's rebuilding
[33:41] this Earth Amen brother Branham showed
[33:44] us in oh my and who is this Melchizedek
[33:46] and future home in Harvest Time numerous
[33:51] messages how that he redeems his family
[33:55] the exact same way he redeems the Earth
[33:57] brother M teaches that constantly
[33:59] especially late in his ministry uses
[34:02] those three same justification
[34:04] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[34:06] Spirit and so he talks about you know it
[34:08] was the the god the Earth God it's water
[34:10] baptism in the time of Noah and it got
[34:13] the blood put on it in the days of Jesus
[34:15] at Calvary and then it's going to get a
[34:17] Holy Ghost Fire I'm glad for that and he
[34:20] said that's the same way you come
[34:21] through the water through the blood and
[34:23] then the fire and you've got to have a
[34:25] holy ghost baptism because here here's
[34:29] his situation you know you're you're
[34:31] going to want to be native to that new
[34:33] world you're not going to want to feel
[34:35] like a foreigner I'm tired of feeling
[34:37] like a foreigner I want to feel home
[34:40] Hallelujah I want to feel like this is
[34:43] the what the world is supposed to be
[34:45] brother Branham said this is a neurotic
[34:48] age and he makes an interesting
[34:49] statement how he says that seemingly we
[34:53] are we live in a world and brother
[34:54] Branham says it in the church age book
[34:56] that we seem unfitted for
[35:00] I think every believer relates to that
[35:03] and say man what a way to say it I
[35:06] that's exactly that hits the nail on the
[35:08] head I I'm living here but I I feel
[35:11] unfitted the world wasn't supposed to be
[35:14] a neurotic the world wasn't supposed to
[35:16] be full of sin my what it was supposed
[35:18] to be full of disease and full of devils
[35:21] and and the lid is torn from hell and we
[35:23] realize brother Brandon said demon
[35:25] powers are streaming they're in the
[35:27] atmospheres
[35:28] said they're they're constantly in the
[35:30] atmospheres to accuse the Brethren see
[35:33] so we realize that that the opening of
[35:36] the seventh seal finds that Satan has
[35:39] lost his position in heaven to accuse
[35:41] the brothers you can put that title
[35:42] slide up brother that'll be just fine
[35:44] that that he lost his his ability to
[35:47] accuse us Before the Throne of God you
[35:49] don't see him in Revelation 5. you see
[35:52] everybody else you see John representing
[35:54] the bride you see the strong Angel
[35:56] representing the messenger of the age
[35:58] you see the one seated on the throne you
[36:00] see the Four and Twenty Elders you get
[36:02] the sea of glass the Angels the four
[36:04] living creatures the seven spirits of
[36:06] God
[36:07] but one thing that's missing is the
[36:09] accuser Hallelujah because well that day
[36:13] on Calvary put his ability to accuse you
[36:16] to God at it's done it's finished God
[36:19] will not hear it brother Brandon said
[36:21] God can't see your mistakes he only sees
[36:24] your representation he sees Christ
[36:28] but we realize that brother Branham said
[36:30] that since the lid was torn from hell
[36:32] you know coming right around the turn of
[36:34] the 20th century just preceding the woes
[36:37] uh star fell from heaven given the keys
[36:40] to the bottomless pit unlisted and that
[36:43] was so that sin could come to the
[36:44] surface hell could come to the service
[36:46] and brother Branham because the woes
[36:49] would have to start in right there to
[36:51] sweep man from the earth I'm not trying
[36:52] to get on that tonight I'm just trying
[36:54] to give you the background but we
[36:55] realized that now demon powers you know
[36:58] they're they're streaming and brother
[36:59] Benham said they're through the heavens
[37:01] and atmospheres uh to accuse the
[37:03] Brethren see they can't get in the I
[37:05] thought I thought about this they can't
[37:07] get in the courtroom but they can stand
[37:09] outside and demonstrate and then carry
[37:12] signs and shout and scream and run them
[37:14] down but the judges are hearing the case
[37:17] Hallelujah
[37:20] so so we realized then that you know
[37:24] finally the bride goes up Satan comes
[37:26] down that's it and then woe into the
[37:28] Earth woe unto you for Satan has come
[37:30] down and he has but a little time he's
[37:32] very angry and the world is going to
[37:34] plunge into a tribulation period now
[37:36] this so brother Brandon is saying that
[37:39] God has what is he doing he had a
[37:42] threefold plan first to make himself
[37:45] fully revealed in Christ and then to in
[37:48] the New Testament era through the
[37:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost that he would
[37:52] gain preeminence he would regain
[37:56] preeminence what he lost when Adam fell
[38:00] and he would regain preeminence over the
[38:03] church his bride and then the last thing
[38:06] would be is that he would restore the
[38:08] kingdom now that's me and you back to
[38:11] its rightly position he's rebuilding
[38:13] Eden
[38:14] he's rebuilding in Eden in Eden before
[38:17] the fall Adam had no sin I'm headed back
[38:20] to no sin Adam had no weakness I'm
[38:22] headed back to no weakness the Earth had
[38:25] no diseases the Earth is headed back to
[38:27] no diseases
[38:29] Hallelujah there weren't political
[38:31] Powers there wasn't civilization there
[38:33] was not a satanic Eden it was a Christ
[38:36] Eden
[38:38] and we're headed back to that
[38:40] and so the prophet says he sent us this
[38:43] message to do what
[38:45] to bring that Eden back to take us out
[38:48] of this chaos and that's where we we're
[38:50] we're wrapping up on on Sunday
[38:53] and so we we found out that you remember
[38:56] the promise that it doesn't matter what
[38:59] Satan does to me I know as job knew that
[39:03] in my flesh I self shall see him and and
[39:07] I and I was I ended on that point to say
[39:09] because you're like me there's times
[39:12] where we say man I maybe I don't know
[39:16] how I guess I he can get brother so and
[39:18] so restored and get sister so and so
[39:20] restored but boy how's he going to get
[39:22] this old boy restored but how's he gonna
[39:24] do it God moved upon the face of the
[39:27] waters what has happened the message has
[39:30] moved across you
[39:32] and it's speaking to the chaos you just
[39:35] believe that friends I don't don't give
[39:37] the devil any Credence I don't care how
[39:40] many successes or failures you might
[39:42] have had this week don't give the devil
[39:44] any Credence God has got everything in
[39:47] perfect control and perfect timing in
[39:50] Perfect Harmony and as I've said to you
[39:52] so many times he's doing more in you
[39:55] than you're aware of
[39:59] he's moving in the earth more than the
[40:01] world thinks he is
[40:02] [Music]
[40:04] they see him as an impersonal being
[40:07] uninterested in the Affairs of of life
[40:10] that's simply not true
[40:12] in fact is nothing really could be
[40:15] further from the truth than that
[40:19] he's intimately involved
[40:22] he's controlling all the situation so
[40:26] brother Branham comes now so here we
[40:28] come
[40:29] to the word becoming flesh in the
[40:32] beginning what's the word and the Word
[40:35] was with God and the Word was God now
[40:38] tonight I hope to on my bridge change
[40:41] the subtitle as you're going to see here
[40:44] this is where we were Sunday hope and
[40:46] Assurance in perilous times now for my
[40:50] bridge sermon to connect last Sunday to
[40:52] this coming Sunday I want to change it
[40:55] to a tree to be desired all right so now
[40:59] we find that brother Branham speaks of
[41:02] this great Fountain I'm gonna I've got a
[41:04] number of quotes that I put up here on
[41:06] purpose and then I've got some quotes
[41:08] that I didn't put up here on purpose
[41:09] because I just want to change into a
[41:12] different uh gear as it were and try to
[41:15] pull you in as we as I get to the Finish
[41:18] Line tonight so so we'll read it first
[41:20] we'll catch the ones that I've posted
[41:23] but brother Branham talks about that
[41:25] that great fountain in eternity from
[41:28] which flowed all good things and how
[41:31] that God that great Fountain of seven
[41:34] colored Fountain and it was love and it
[41:37] was peace and it was Harmony and and he
[41:40] and he talks about I don't want to I
[41:42] don't want to get ahead of the quote
[41:43] you'll read it for you you read it with
[41:45] me as we go but how that all good things
[41:49] flowed down from that and that God this
[41:52] great spirit that filled all time space
[41:55] and Eternity now we're going back
[41:58] further than Genesis 1. last weekend we
[42:01] were at Genesis one two so now that I'm
[42:04] going further into my thought we got to
[42:06] go further back
[42:08] all right so in the beginning was the
[42:11] word and the Word was with God and the
[42:13] Word was God back in that eternity where
[42:16] he said that great God he desired he
[42:20] desired to share his existence with
[42:23] other people he desired to share his
[42:27] eternal life with Humanity oh my friends
[42:30] and the world takes such a such a
[42:34] Cavalier
[42:35] nonchalant attitude toward God they it's
[42:38] almost like God show me what you can
[42:40] offer and I'll think about it and get
[42:42] back to you my goodness here's the God
[42:45] of all universe who who spawned
[42:48] everything that there is and this great
[42:51] being when you're nothing but a little
[42:53] pepper Speck on a little dot of a planet
[42:55] amidst amidst billions of galaxies and
[42:59] God is coming that God is coming offer
[43:02] himself to you
[43:04] what's there to think about
[43:07] see
[43:09] he desired to share his existence
[43:11] brother Brandon picks it up here in life
[43:13] 1957.
[43:16] he says and how that in the world we
[43:18] know that there is a I love this
[43:20] contrast now watch this there is a real
[43:23] true Spirit of Love there is a real true
[43:26] Spirit of loyalty there is a real true
[43:29] Spirit of honesty how many knows that we
[43:31] know it we see it well that is God the
[43:35] very Fountain so I know that the world
[43:38] is dishonest but there's a real honesty
[43:40] I know the world is not loyal but there
[43:43] is a loyal I know the world is full of
[43:46] of what they call love but there is a
[43:48] real true Spirit of love
[43:53] let's get let's let's Close Our Eyes now
[43:56] don't you do that he won't be able to
[43:57] read
[43:59] let's close our eyes to our imaginations
[44:02] Okay do that
[44:04] in other words he's saying he wants you
[44:05] to use your imagination
[44:07] for just a few moments and go way back
[44:11] into the for there was anything I love
[44:15] that I love that Kentucky way of saying
[44:18] it let's go back too far there was
[44:21] anything
[44:23] that the great Fountain of all eternity
[44:26] was that Spirit of love joy that Spirit
[44:30] of honesty that spirit of trueness in
[44:32] this Perfection and then out of the
[44:34] existence of the father with the logos
[44:37] he's talking about the pillar of fire
[44:38] which was the son which was a theophany
[44:42] which was the body of the great Jehovah
[44:44] God went forth in a Celestial body now
[44:47] see so brother Brennan explains it two
[44:50] ways before he did that before he did
[44:53] that
[44:54] then he was brother Bradham says he's he
[44:56] was he's like the wind he was just that
[44:59] great spirit now he's not exactly like
[45:01] the wind but that's the closest analogy
[45:03] of human language brother Branham could
[45:05] put it in human terms see and he said
[45:08] he's like the wind but now once that
[45:09] once this happens then brother Brandon
[45:12] would later say now he's not like the
[45:14] wind he's a being he lives in a house
[45:16] because why he doesn't go backwards he
[45:19] went forwards in expression now he's a
[45:22] Son of God not a an alternate separate
[45:25] God he's that great spirit condensed
[45:28] into that Pillar of Fire that now moves
[45:31] and in that form that's what he created
[45:33] everything in
[45:34] that's the form that spoke the world
[45:36] into existence that's why our text says
[45:39] in the beginning was the word and the
[45:42] Word was with God and the word and it
[45:44] was God and then later on it shows how
[45:46] that the word became flesh and dwelt
[45:49] among us all right
[45:50] so he says
[45:52] and then out of the existence of the
[45:54] father when the logos which was the son
[45:56] which was theophany which was the body
[45:58] of the great Jehovah God went forth in a
[46:00] Celestial body that's the logos the word
[46:03] spoke out of them great Fountains of
[46:06] life and went forth and there was the
[46:08] theophany which was God made into word
[46:12] then that theophany was made flesh and
[46:14] the person of Christ Jesus and then all
[46:17] the fullness of the trinity dwelt in him
[46:20] both Father Son and Holy Spirit all in
[46:24] that isn't that a beautiful way I love
[46:26] how a prophet can just make that so
[46:28] clear watch
[46:31] resurrection of Lazarus now let's just
[46:34] picture that as a as a being a white
[46:38] Halo coming out of that out of that
[46:41] space that was the Son of God the logos
[46:44] and there it was in space moving around
[46:48] like a little child playing before the
[46:50] door of its parent and he drawed in his
[46:52] mind what should be so now you know it's
[46:56] almost like a language that it's like a
[46:58] little child so it is separate from God
[47:00] brother Branham is only using human
[47:03] language so that you can understand
[47:04] there was a before this
[47:07] then there was a this then there was an
[47:09] after this see so the the the analogy
[47:13] what happened to my screen
[47:20] okay uh come come on down
[47:24] okay let me let me see if I can take it
[47:26] from there
[47:27] okay yeah we're back out all right
[47:30] so he says that was the son of God all
[47:33] right
[47:35] um white Halo that the Son of God the
[47:38] logo I said there it was in space moving
[47:41] around like a little child playing
[47:43] before the door of its parent
[47:45] and he and he drawed in his mind you
[47:49] ever seen a kid do that a kid will sit
[47:51] down and draw
[47:53] and a lot of times there it might not be
[47:55] what they'll be able to do later but it
[47:58] they're just getting started and so so
[48:00] now Prophet is using this human analogy
[48:03] so that you can understand he he was
[48:06] drawing his ideas he was drawing you he
[48:10] was drawing me he was drunk he was all
[48:12] alone in this great expense but he
[48:14] didn't want to be alone brother Ben
[48:15] called him and it took a prophet to say
[48:17] it the lonely God
[48:19] see so he says and I can hear I can hear
[48:23] him look around and say there was
[48:27] nothing nowhere no just vastness of
[48:30] space the father covered all the space
[48:32] and then this God become vitalized
[48:35] that's a neat word
[48:37] by the lies down to the logos that made
[48:40] those doctors of divinity lose their
[48:42] false teeth down to the logos he became
[48:45] bottleized down to the logos
[48:49] I can hear him say let there be light
[48:52] and an atom bursted
[48:55] see so we find then that that when we
[48:58] talk about the Big Bang there's a big
[49:00] bang just like there's a Evolution it's
[49:04] just science muddles muddies the water
[49:06] and gets it wrong
[49:08] but there was an evolution and there was
[49:11] a big bang an Adam God spoke and an atom
[49:14] bursted see Yonder and the son come into
[49:17] existence did he she began to whirl
[49:21] millions of years rolled by you with me
[49:25] we lost it again
[49:27] amen never had that happen
[49:31] all right millions of years rolled by
[49:36] and after a while
[49:37] a piece flew off of it
[49:40] a star
[49:42] and he stood out there and watched it
[49:44] and it went all down he stopped it over
[49:48] here after it fell a few million years
[49:50] phew off when another one he let it fall
[49:54] near a certain place and he stopped it
[49:56] what's he doing brother Adam says in one
[49:59] place he's building he's writing his
[50:00] first Bible
[50:01] remember he started drawing and now he's
[50:04] writing his first Bible here he says
[50:06] he's got in his mind now that someday
[50:09] there will be an earth there will be
[50:11] mankind on Earth this is when there was
[50:13] nothing
[50:14] oh my see
[50:17] all right so then he comes now now he's
[50:20] going to come we're gonna we're gonna
[50:21] make a a giant leap to where you've got
[50:24] the Earth and as we were saying last
[50:27] Sunday it was Darkness covered the face
[50:29] of the deep and chaos and God spoke and
[50:32] said let there be light let the water
[50:34] separate from the land let the dry land
[50:36] appear and brother Branham and and God
[50:38] goes through the days of creation uh
[50:41] bringing until he gets all the way up to
[50:43] he starts evoluting with the lower with
[50:46] the lower uh you know mineral Kingdom
[50:49] and then he evolutes up to a Botanical
[50:51] Kingdom and then he evolutes up to a a
[50:54] an animal kingdom and then he evolutes
[50:56] the animal kingdom all the way up till
[50:58] he finally brother Branham said he
[51:00] finally got a masterpiece
[51:03] a being in his own image
[51:07] a man
[51:09] in his own image and this was God's
[51:13] perfect Masterpiece now
[51:15] brother Brandon would show because you
[51:17] he that even has to be qualified because
[51:20] he was a masterpiece in the sense that
[51:22] he reached the highest evolution see
[51:24] that's where brother Branham said
[51:25] Evolution there is an evolution it
[51:28] doesn't change species but God kept
[51:30] evoluting all the way up you know a
[51:33] tadpole didn't turn into a horse which
[51:35] turned into a gorilla which turned into
[51:36] me
[51:44] insulting to think that that's insulting
[51:47] to God insulting to me as a human being
[51:49] made in the image of God and so so we
[51:52] realized that that that no animals
[51:55] there's nowhere in the animal kingdom
[51:57] that animals worship or prey only humans
[52:00] do that see because they were building
[52:03] the image of God and so we come but then
[52:06] we but then when you realize that while
[52:07] Adam and his creation form was God's
[52:11] perfect Masterpiece but yet
[52:15] was actually
[52:17] more
[52:19] complete
[52:20] after the fall than before
[52:23] because you say my he was at a lower
[52:26] stated truth that's all true in his in
[52:28] his in his uh physical form he was in a
[52:32] lower state but now he understands what
[52:35] a redeemer is now he understands what a
[52:38] Healer is he never had that
[52:40] understanding before he never had a
[52:41] concept of being sick or being separated
[52:44] always peace forever every day
[52:47] and now he can he can see a bloody skin
[52:51] that those bloody skins for a message
[52:54] see Abel caught the revelation of that
[52:57] message
[52:58] all right now so brother Branham comes
[53:00] to Adam now watch we're going to pick up
[53:02] the seam with Adam and Eve he's already
[53:04] put him to sleep he's already brought
[53:06] Eve out and brother Branham comes in the
[53:09] Masterpiece and he says it like this now
[53:12] first he had a masterpiece of himself
[53:15] but now he's seen that the Masterpiece
[53:19] was lonesome like he was so he divided
[53:21] he's going to bring Eve forward he
[53:23] divided the Masterpiece by striking it
[53:25] on the side and brought forth the help
[53:27] made and now
[53:28] to make the two one he put them like any
[53:31] great sculptor in a place that's
[53:34] beautiful a sculptor he says a sculptor
[53:36] wouldn't make a masterpiece and then
[53:39] take it and set it in an alley that
[53:42] makes sense doesn't it
[53:43] he wouldn't take it and set it in an
[53:45] alley somewhere or hide it behind
[53:47] buildings as our Lord told us a man
[53:50] doesn't light a candle and put it under
[53:51] a bushel he placed it up here on the
[53:54] earth and put it in the most beautiful
[53:56] place there was in the Garden of Eden
[53:59] see all right
[54:01] see he placed his Masterpiece the two
[54:05] being one in the Garden of Eden how it
[54:09] must have pleased him that he saw his
[54:12] Masterpiece was well he after that we
[54:15] find out that he rested he was so well
[54:18] pleased with his work and now we see
[54:21] them as a masterpiece family in the
[54:25] Garden of Eden how beautiful it was
[54:28] that's what he's bringing us back to a
[54:32] masterpiece family in a beautiful garden
[54:36] my and it so pleased him till he took
[54:40] rest
[54:41] but why oh watch but while he was
[54:44] resting and trusting in his Masterpiece
[54:48] he made him a amateur God made him a God
[54:51] over the Earth God didn't Brothers God
[54:53] didn't create the Earth for himself to
[54:54] rule he rules the heavens he created the
[54:57] Earth for man to rule
[54:59] he placed his masterpiece the two being
[55:02] one in the Garden of Eden um let's see
[55:04] we're at 53 yeah but while he was
[55:07] resting and trusting to his masterpiece
[55:10] his enemy come in and found this Great
[55:14] Masterpiece see now you're going back to
[55:16] that ancient war
[55:18] where Lucifer tried to uh you know have
[55:21] a coup and take over uh the kingdom of
[55:24] Michael and tried to establish himself
[55:26] in a hostile takeover and he was quickly
[55:29] just dispensed and thrown out of heaven
[55:32] so he says his enemy
[55:34] uh come in and found this great
[55:37] masterpiece
[55:39] and he by deceit he crawls under the
[55:43] garden walls and then he marred this
[55:46] beautiful Masterpiece he marred so that
[55:49] it fell the Masterpiece was broke
[55:54] now I love this
[55:57] but the great Sculptor
[55:59] when he seen the fall of his family the
[56:03] masterpiece
[56:04] he wasn't willing
[56:06] just to leave it lay their face down and
[56:09] ruin he went to work immediately to
[56:13] build it up again
[56:15] he wasn't willing that it should perish
[56:18] lay there like that all the time because
[56:21] he's God and he will not be defeated so
[56:24] he went to work immediately and began to
[56:26] build again unto his own image a man he
[56:28] ended up with Christ but I'm glad in
[56:31] your life and in my life when he sees us
[56:33] laying face down and the enemy knocks us
[56:36] off our feet he's not willing to see you
[56:39] just lay there in ruin it doesn't matter
[56:42] how ruined
[56:44] he's not willing to leave you in that
[56:46] condition he's always going to
[56:49] immediately begin to build you back
[56:54] Thank God now that's the end of my
[56:57] presentation
[57:00] so
[57:01] we come then to this this this lie this
[57:05] false concept
[57:07] how did it get broken
[57:10] You Know The Enemy come in
[57:13] and he slipped under the Garden Wall
[57:16] and he deceived Eve and I I Really Wanna
[57:21] bring an angle tonight that perhaps you
[57:25] haven't heard or in a while maybe and
[57:28] even if you have it's it'll be it'll do
[57:30] you good as a refresher you know Eve
[57:33] gets a lot of bad press and she you know
[57:37] she gets really uh hammered on a lot
[57:40] because of what she did and thanks to
[57:43] Eve you know and and the and and we hear
[57:46] a lot of of you know uh I don't even
[57:49] want to DARE go down that path but you
[57:52] know I'm here to tell you something that
[57:54] that God loved Eve just as much as he
[57:57] loved Adam
[57:59] and when she fell he didn't love her any
[58:02] less
[58:03] now his law would have required
[58:05] something just like you his law would
[58:07] require him to to take you out
[58:11] but that's why Christ came Hallelujah
[58:14] when Esther came before a hazarus
[58:17] without it without a legal standing that
[58:21] the law was she had to die but a
[58:24] hazardous loved her and extended the
[58:26] Royal scepter
[58:28] and that scepter was Christ and it stood
[58:30] between her in judgment
[58:32] Hallelujah
[58:34] see so now watch you're going to watch a
[58:36] beautiful love story
[58:39] he says in 1955 in the message job
[58:42] he says I see I love that word
[58:45] he says Yonder I see and I think you
[58:48] know we were talking about it here
[58:49] recently what is it a prophet sees
[58:51] I'm so glad to be a follower of a
[58:53] prophet
[58:56] Yonder I see Adam and Eve now I want you
[58:58] to listen to the how a prophet words
[59:00] this
[59:01] Yonder I see Adam and Eve that first
[59:05] little sweethearts
[59:08] isn't that adorable
[59:10] that first little sweethearts there in
[59:13] the Garden of Eden I see Adam back there
[59:16] and
[59:16] when he put his arms around his little
[59:19] sweetheart to walk out with her for God
[59:22] had condemned them
[59:24] and he started out with his arms around
[59:26] his darling and Adam was not deceived he
[59:30] didn't have to walk out
[59:33] he didn't have to walk out I hope you
[59:36] see Christ at his bride he didn't have
[59:38] to go to Calvary he didn't have to but
[59:40] he wanted to
[59:44] he walked out because he loved his wife
[59:49] he walked out with both eyes wide open
[59:52] no matter
[59:53] no matter I love this line
[59:56] no matter if she had to go to torment
[59:58] he'd go with her
[1:00:01] oh my goodness
[1:00:03] oh I want I thought I'm gonna have to
[1:00:05] resist going down getting on one knee
[1:00:07] and singing to my wife
[1:00:09] oh my
[1:00:11] God when God now watch this when God saw
[1:00:14] that
[1:00:16] when God saw
[1:00:18] what Adam was willing to do he didn't
[1:00:22] have to do it he could have just said
[1:00:24] you broke the word of God and God would
[1:00:27] have his law would have destroyed her
[1:00:29] and he would have gave adam another wife
[1:00:32] and and she would have been burnt with
[1:00:35] the serpent
[1:00:36] see because that's God's Wrath God's law
[1:00:39] was broken but Adam portraying Christ
[1:00:42] you had no chance you would have went to
[1:00:45] hell with the Devil you were just as
[1:00:47] guilty in this life as the devil was
[1:00:50] when he tried to take over Heaven you
[1:00:52] were also in defiance of God but God
[1:00:54] rich in Mercy Christ loving you
[1:00:59] he didn't have to go to Calvary but he
[1:01:01] did
[1:01:04] then he says if she had to go to torment
[1:01:07] he'd go with her
[1:01:09] and when God looked down and seen that
[1:01:13] love of a human being
[1:01:16] it was so great that he couldn't stand
[1:01:20] at himself that's right he said I'll
[1:01:24] come and go too oh Hallelujah God said
[1:01:28] this is a portrait
[1:01:29] rolling on my heartstrings this is my
[1:01:32] plan in Redemption and Someday I'm gonna
[1:01:34] do the same thing
[1:01:36] Hallelujah there was a Divine message in
[1:01:39] those bloody sheepskins those bloody
[1:01:41] lands lambskins there was a message that
[1:01:44] God was giving to them someday I'll join
[1:01:47] you in the earth someday I'll be born of
[1:01:50] a woman just like you I'll grow and I'll
[1:01:52] become a man and I don't worry my dear
[1:01:55] I'll please God in everything and you
[1:01:58] get credit for my life
[1:02:01] I'll please God for the both of us
[1:02:04] I won't just go with you to judgment in
[1:02:07] fact he doesn't just go with us to
[1:02:10] judgment
[1:02:11] he goes instead of us
[1:02:13] to judgment
[1:02:18] Satan deceived Eve
[1:02:21] and to think
[1:02:22] to think something good
[1:02:25] and a tree to be desired
[1:02:28] to make one wise is the tree of
[1:02:30] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:02:33] she was told not to eat it
[1:02:36] it's told not to touch it
[1:02:38] she even testified that God said don't
[1:02:40] even don't look at it don't touch it
[1:02:42] don't have nothing to do with it stand
[1:02:43] away from it
[1:02:45] Satan deceived her into thinking that it
[1:02:48] was something good
[1:02:50] and that it was a tree to be desired to
[1:02:53] make one wise
[1:02:54] and here's here's something that brother
[1:02:57] Branham points out over and over and
[1:03:00] over I could have just read all the
[1:03:03] quotes tonight till closing time how
[1:03:05] many times he said what I just put one
[1:03:07] of them I just brought one quote but he
[1:03:09] starts saying it in the 50s and runs all
[1:03:11] the way into the 60s and he's saying it
[1:03:13] over and over and over again we're going
[1:03:15] to realize here that that when Satan
[1:03:17] deceived her into into thinking it was
[1:03:19] something good she didn't believe she
[1:03:22] was doing something wrong
[1:03:25] you understand it wasn't like us like
[1:03:28] James said when a man is in is enticed
[1:03:31] of his own sin and led away when lust
[1:03:34] you know he lust and he's enticed and of
[1:03:36] his own sin and then he gets LED away
[1:03:38] and then when that ends its death with
[1:03:40] Eve that's not what was happening
[1:03:42] this isn't even some lustful passion
[1:03:46] Eve actually believed that you know she
[1:03:51] she was doing something good
[1:03:54] that that that that she didn't believe
[1:03:57] she was doing something wrong she
[1:03:59] thought she was right
[1:04:02] she was deceived
[1:04:04] but she thought she was right
[1:04:07] brother Brandon starts saying it here
[1:04:08] God making his promise remember
[1:04:11] how he took Adam and Eve before the
[1:04:14] world was
[1:04:15] before sin came into the world look at
[1:04:18] Adam what a beautiful type Adam and Eve
[1:04:20] was a type of Christ in his church now
[1:04:22] remember now watch this is real tricky
[1:04:25] you're going to have to really pay
[1:04:26] attention because I have to explain it
[1:04:27] to you now remember
[1:04:30] Eve did not sin
[1:04:33] now we're about to read
[1:04:36] you know uh First Timothy 2 and Adam was
[1:04:39] not deceived but the woman being
[1:04:41] deceived was in the transgression
[1:04:43] brother Brown's not denying that I'm
[1:04:45] gonna just hold on
[1:04:47] eat remember Eve did not sin
[1:04:50] Adam sinned that's right not Eve Adam's
[1:04:55] sin see not Eve she was the one who did
[1:04:59] the ACT
[1:05:01] but Adam done the sinning the woman was
[1:05:05] deceived
[1:05:06] see so now when you read first Timothy 2
[1:05:10] 14 and Adam was not deceived but the
[1:05:13] woman being deceived was in the
[1:05:15] transgression that's true but remember
[1:05:17] Paul had even previous to that had
[1:05:20] already taught the Romans in 5 12 and 14
[1:05:24] wherefore as by one man sin entered into
[1:05:28] the world all right and death by sin and
[1:05:33] so death passed upon all men for that
[1:05:36] all have sinned verse 14 nevertheless
[1:05:38] death reigned from Adam to Moses even
[1:05:42] over them that had not sinned after the
[1:05:45] similitude of Adam's transgression
[1:05:48] see
[1:05:49] so so we realized that Eve certainly
[1:05:52] committed a transgression of God's word
[1:05:55] but it wasn't Eve that broke the world
[1:05:59] that's what a prophet is saying it
[1:06:01] wasn't Eve that broke the world Eve got
[1:06:04] tricked into she thought it was
[1:06:07] something good
[1:06:08] she didn't think it was something bad
[1:06:11] it was Adam's sin that collapsed nature
[1:06:15] and plunged all us all into sin and
[1:06:19] death when Adam felt brother Branham
[1:06:21] said when Adam fell everything under him
[1:06:25] fell
[1:06:26] all nature all creation all animals Eve
[1:06:30] also found everybody everything and when
[1:06:32] Adam did that see because Adam wasn't
[1:06:35] merely a Son of God the Bible says he
[1:06:38] was the son of God
[1:06:39] he was the first Adam that's why Christ
[1:06:41] come as the second Adam because it's
[1:06:44] going to have to be somebody who's the
[1:06:46] son of God but now born of a woman
[1:06:49] come into the world born of a woman he's
[1:06:51] the only begotten of the father see but
[1:06:54] he had no sin there was no sex act to
[1:06:56] get him here it was God returning the
[1:06:59] order back to the spoken word and using
[1:07:01] Christ he was going to redeem me and you
[1:07:03] the same way and redeem his whole earth
[1:07:05] the same way
[1:07:07] why because he's God and he will not be
[1:07:10] defeated it doesn't matter how Wicked
[1:07:13] This World gets it doesn't matter how
[1:07:14] weak I might feel God is not going to be
[1:07:18] defeated
[1:07:20] see
[1:07:22] so it wasn't he she did transgress the
[1:07:24] word of God but she's not the one who
[1:07:26] broke the world brother Adam goes on the
[1:07:27] Bible says
[1:07:29] she was deceived
[1:07:31] she thought she was right
[1:07:35] and brother Brandon makes that statement
[1:07:37] again and again and again and again year
[1:07:39] after year after year after year
[1:07:42] she thought she was right
[1:07:45] but Adam note it was wrong see and now
[1:07:48] look when Adam saw Eve had sinned and
[1:07:52] had done wrong
[1:07:53] Adam walked right out not deceived but
[1:07:57] with both eyes open but he loved Eve see
[1:08:01] he so loved Eve that he took her place
[1:08:06] in death with her and walked out with
[1:08:09] her see brother Adam said that's Christ
[1:08:11] in the church the church was guilty but
[1:08:13] Christ took our place
[1:08:15] he comes now to show us the father
[1:08:20] he says now now he's he's telling you a
[1:08:24] story
[1:08:25] you still got your imagination station
[1:08:26] working
[1:08:28] show us the father and it's sad as it'll
[1:08:31] satisfy us
[1:08:33] but then when I see and here's a prophet
[1:08:35] back with his prophetic eyes he's seeing
[1:08:38] something again
[1:08:39] but then when I see
[1:08:42] when poor little Eve
[1:08:45] see they they make all kinds of claims
[1:08:47] that brother Branham hated women and he
[1:08:49] was terrible and he was misogynistic and
[1:08:51] he was all this kind of stuff I wish
[1:08:53] they would publish this kind of stuff on
[1:08:55] the website
[1:08:56] he says but when I see when poor little
[1:09:00] Eve
[1:09:01] looked over in the face of Adam
[1:09:04] and knowed that she was the cause of the
[1:09:06] fall of the human race she threw her
[1:09:08] arms around him
[1:09:09] and Adam was not deceived the Bible said
[1:09:12] he walked out with both eyes open Eve
[1:09:15] was deceived he said so he walked out he
[1:09:19] seen that he wasn't deceived
[1:09:22] so he wasn't deceived and knew he wasn't
[1:09:24] deceived so his wife was turned and he
[1:09:30] put his arms around her oh friends
[1:09:33] that's what happened to me one day
[1:09:35] that's what happened to me when I knew
[1:09:37] that I was guilty I threw my arms around
[1:09:40] him at Calvary and he threw his arms
[1:09:42] right back around me again
[1:09:44] Hallelujah Eve never thought she was
[1:09:46] wrong she and brother Ben said she
[1:09:48] didn't want to do something wrong it
[1:09:51] wasn't like that it wasn't like that she
[1:09:53] wasn't caught in some passion emotion
[1:09:56] and committed adultery against her
[1:09:58] husband she loved Adam
[1:10:02] she loved Adam they were sweethearts
[1:10:08] she was so convinced
[1:10:10] that it was a good thing
[1:10:13] she was so convinced even after the fact
[1:10:18] she was so convinced that it was a good
[1:10:20] thing she revealed it to Adam right away
[1:10:23] without any feeling of Shame up to that
[1:10:26] point
[1:10:27] she immediately went and showed it to
[1:10:29] Adam and said look look what I look what
[1:10:31] I've discovered she had no shame she
[1:10:33] wasn't embarrassed she didn't come
[1:10:34] weeping and crying you understand are
[1:10:37] you in Eve's mind now for a minute
[1:10:38] you're you're in her heart with me this
[1:10:41] is where a prophet has taken us to
[1:10:43] because it this is exposing me I I don't
[1:10:46] want to be a sinner I want to be holy
[1:10:49] I
[1:10:51] I tried to do my best and I know I
[1:10:52] failed and I know I have but I don't
[1:10:54] want to I want to be holy and I want to
[1:10:56] put my arms around the only one who can
[1:10:58] save me
[1:11:00] thank God he put his arms around you he
[1:11:02] put his arms around me
[1:11:05] she's so convinced she comes immediately
[1:11:08] to tell him about it no shame not not at
[1:11:11] that not at that point
[1:11:13] see Satan brother says and uses
[1:11:16] different terms one time he says 95
[1:11:18] other times he talks about one percent
[1:11:20] you know one word Satan gave her 99 pure
[1:11:24] gospel and deceived her
[1:11:26] 99 pure gospel
[1:11:29] say wow if it's that tight how in the
[1:11:32] world
[1:11:33] am I ever going to know I mean if it's
[1:11:35] if it's 99 pure gospel here's the only
[1:11:37] thing you got to look for here's the
[1:11:39] only thing you got to look for
[1:11:40] does it change the word
[1:11:43] what the devil's trying to get you to
[1:11:45] believe
[1:11:46] you see with Eve all it was was one
[1:11:48] three letter word but it changed what
[1:11:52] God told her not to do to doing
[1:11:55] so it wasn't it wasn't though it was
[1:11:57] only one little three-letter word though
[1:11:59] it was only one percent wrong
[1:12:02] but that one percent is all it took and
[1:12:05] all she would have had to have done was
[1:12:06] said wait a minute wait a minute he told
[1:12:08] me not to you're telling me to
[1:12:12] you see it's just like the Trinity the
[1:12:15] Trinity's only the the the Trinity
[1:12:17] Doctrine is just a one percent wording
[1:12:19] error that's really all it is
[1:12:21] it's one Greek word different that lists
[1:12:25] three that lists Father Son and Holy
[1:12:28] Ghost as three persons
[1:12:31] see rather than three offices
[1:12:34] he and brother Brown said he didn't he
[1:12:36] is a trinity he does operate in a
[1:12:38] trinity brother Branham taught the
[1:12:40] Trinity he absolutely taught the Trinity
[1:12:41] he just didn't teach the Catholic
[1:12:44] version of the trinity
[1:12:46] but he taught the Bible version of the
[1:12:48] Trinity that he was God above god with
[1:12:52] God in the same God
[1:12:54] see and so Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:12:57] Darwin in evolution is only one percent
[1:12:59] wording error
[1:13:01] oh he's absolutely correct except for
[1:13:03] one thing he thinks the species crossed
[1:13:06] over and they don't the Bible said every
[1:13:07] seed brings forth of its own kind
[1:13:09] so as soon as I don't care if it's one
[1:13:11] percent or a half a percent if it
[1:13:14] changes what God tells you to do in his
[1:13:16] word and it tells you to do something
[1:13:18] different leave it alone
[1:13:22] he says in Fellowship all right he keeps
[1:13:25] saying this and I can see them going
[1:13:29] I can see Eve all right here you go turn
[1:13:31] your own turn on your imagination again
[1:13:34] I can see Eve
[1:13:36] see her lay her little head over on
[1:13:39] Adam's shoulder saying Adam
[1:13:42] it's all my fault
[1:13:44] I was the one who did it
[1:13:46] but Adam so loved his wife you see
[1:13:49] friends once Adam partook of it then all
[1:13:53] nature under him fell
[1:13:56] you see that see then then they not not
[1:14:00] just
[1:14:03] she was naked
[1:14:05] that didn't strike her after the ACT she
[1:14:08] comes back with a good idea she thought
[1:14:10] she'd done the right thing she's happy
[1:14:12] to to tell him but once Adam partookaba
[1:14:15] partook of it then nature collapsed and
[1:14:18] immediately Adam and Eve both knew they
[1:14:20] were naked and they hid themselves
[1:14:22] you see the difference see
[1:14:26] so Satan you see the the the thing of it
[1:14:28] is Satan can only pervert God's way
[1:14:33] now I want to come to one more point
[1:14:37] and I'll feel successful that I've
[1:14:39] bridged last Sunday to this coming
[1:14:42] Sunday
[1:14:45] brother random says
[1:14:47] in the Ephesian Church age in the church
[1:14:49] age book
[1:14:51] if he's in church age
[1:14:53] he starts talking about the tree of
[1:14:55] knowledge
[1:14:56] and the tree of of you know of Good and
[1:15:00] Evil tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:15:02] versus the Tree of Life
[1:15:05] and he says a man
[1:15:08] could not directly come
[1:15:10] and partake of that tree of life in the
[1:15:14] midst of the garden
[1:15:16] that Eternal term that eternal life of
[1:15:20] the tree had to become flesh first
[1:15:26] see
[1:15:27] now remember Moses is just using the
[1:15:30] term trees
[1:15:32] in one sense Eve partook of a tree and
[1:15:35] she had an illicit affair with us with
[1:15:37] an animal
[1:15:38] with a serpent but Moses calls it eating
[1:15:41] the fruit of a tree
[1:15:42] and so now you've got Christ see this is
[1:15:45] why they are put out of the Garden of
[1:15:47] Eden because the he says lest they put
[1:15:50] forth their hand and take of the tree of
[1:15:52] life and live forever in other words
[1:15:54] that catch catch a revelation
[1:15:57] of Christ because a revelation of Christ
[1:16:01] is your new birth
[1:16:03] and if they would catch a revelation of
[1:16:05] Christ before Calvary then they're going
[1:16:09] to receive eternal life in a fallen
[1:16:10] condition and the whole plan is blown to
[1:16:13] pieces you see you understand this is
[1:16:16] God's grand scheme this is his great
[1:16:19] drama this is his plan all along Satan
[1:16:22] didn't come in one day and Sucker Punch
[1:16:24] God this was all on the drawing board
[1:16:27] ages before Satan was even created God
[1:16:30] had already slew the land before the
[1:16:33] foundation of the world
[1:16:34] he already knew what was going to go
[1:16:36] forward he already knows about you you
[1:16:38] think I won't be there when he already
[1:16:40] knows you will be Hallelujah said I
[1:16:43] can't make it but he already knows
[1:16:45] you're gonna make it
[1:16:46] Hallelujah
[1:16:49] see you've got to remember that Jesus
[1:16:51] was the son brother but I'm taught that
[1:16:53] so clear our brothers on our Thursday
[1:16:55] night men's prayer meeting we're going
[1:16:57] through the spoken words original seat
[1:16:58] and brother Branham is making that point
[1:17:00] how that evil that Christ was the son
[1:17:03] that she would have had
[1:17:06] see but she couldn't wait she ran ahead
[1:17:09] of God's plan but it served God's
[1:17:10] purpose because Redemption had to play
[1:17:13] out
[1:17:14] see so there had to be a false to the so
[1:17:18] the Tree of Life
[1:17:19] so then today you realize
[1:17:23] that Satan now this is a big Point
[1:17:26] there's a big point
[1:17:29] Satan can't create
[1:17:33] he can only pervert
[1:17:35] he can only take what God is doing
[1:17:38] and make a copy of it to deceive people
[1:17:41] by he can't get it perfect
[1:17:44] he can impersonate all kinds of gifts he
[1:17:47] can he can appear in all kinds of forms
[1:17:50] but brother Branham said that when it
[1:17:52] comes to that life he can't he doesn't
[1:17:54] have the power to produce the life
[1:17:56] he can't he can't create he can't give
[1:17:59] life and so what does he do now catch it
[1:18:03] I hope I I hope I'm able to to put this
[1:18:05] in your in your heart tonight
[1:18:07] he comes to Eve
[1:18:10] and he offers her
[1:18:13] this
[1:18:14] way of gaining knowledge that God had
[1:18:17] forbid her to go forward in
[1:18:19] she would have come to that brother
[1:18:21] Branham says that she would have come to
[1:18:23] that
[1:18:24] see but he's he's saying now oh here's a
[1:18:27] great revelation
[1:18:28] and she wasn't supposed to touch it
[1:18:31] right then but he says no you can have
[1:18:32] it now remember he came to Jesus and put
[1:18:35] him up and said all you got to do is
[1:18:36] Fall Down and Worship me you can have it
[1:18:37] now
[1:18:38] but Jesus knew he knew not to run ahead
[1:18:40] of the program he knew he had to go to
[1:18:42] Calvary it's like brother uh brother
[1:18:44] Daryl was saying he's in the garden and
[1:18:46] he's saying God you can father you can
[1:18:48] do anything
[1:18:50] but yet there there had to be a
[1:18:53] sacrifice in order in order to save man
[1:18:56] that's what brother Daryl that point was
[1:18:57] so heavy he said it remember he read
[1:18:59] that where brother Brandon is saying
[1:19:01] he's sitting around the campfire with
[1:19:02] his disciples he's out on the boat
[1:19:04] fishing with the disciples they're
[1:19:06] they're humans they're men they're
[1:19:07] friends they're buddies they're they're
[1:19:09] they're laughing they're talking about
[1:19:11] the scripture you know one minute
[1:19:13] they're feeding animals one next minute
[1:19:14] they're feeding themselves I mean he was
[1:19:16] a man
[1:19:18] he got dust on his feet and sweat on his
[1:19:20] brow he hadn't he you know he had to
[1:19:23] bathe and change clothes and and he had
[1:19:26] real life
[1:19:27] and as he's sitting in brother around
[1:19:29] says as he's sitting around the campfire
[1:19:31] looking at these Brethren who he loved
[1:19:33] he loved them and he knew
[1:19:36] if I don't do this
[1:19:38] they can't make it
[1:19:41] they can't make it if I'm not willing to
[1:19:44] do this
[1:19:45] then this has to come to an end
[1:19:48] but God loving his family and here comes
[1:19:53] the serpent now remember he's only going
[1:19:55] to pervert something real
[1:19:57] and the Bible says when Eve saw
[1:20:02] that the tree was good and and to be
[1:20:05] desired
[1:20:07] to make one wise she took of it so Satan
[1:20:12] managed to make the false tree the
[1:20:17] desired tree
[1:20:19] that's our subtitle tonight a tree to be
[1:20:22] desired
[1:20:23] but we find that the tree of life is
[1:20:27] actually the tree to be desired and
[1:20:30] Satan got her to think of his knowledge
[1:20:32] as what needs to be desired that's
[1:20:34] that's not desirable
[1:20:36] the tree of life is what is to be
[1:20:39] desired today the tree of knowledge
[1:20:40] broke the world and plunged all of God's
[1:20:43] family into sin but the tree of life
[1:20:45] brings me back
[1:20:47] Hallelujah the tree of life brings the
[1:20:49] world back with it
[1:20:52] it's a tree to be desired
[1:20:56] finally brother Branham says in the
[1:20:58] future home
[1:20:59] I made this point as I got started see
[1:21:01] you were made listen to this now
[1:21:03] this right here will put vitamins in
[1:21:05] your soul
[1:21:07] this will give you the devil's answer
[1:21:09] before he has the question
[1:21:12] see you were made
[1:21:14] for an eternal purpose
[1:21:19] because there's a reason for it now
[1:21:21] you're made for an eternal reason
[1:21:23] there's a there's a method to it that's
[1:21:25] not just a floating statement that's not
[1:21:28] just poetic license
[1:21:30] you were made for an eternal purpose
[1:21:32] because you was the manifestation of an
[1:21:36] attribute that was in God that thought
[1:21:40] of you and expressed you
[1:21:45] that's back to John 1 1.
[1:21:50] that great eternal spirit
[1:21:52] thought about himself as a family and
[1:21:56] expressed himself in the logos
[1:21:58] and you were in that spirit and you got
[1:22:01] expressed into the logos and you're here
[1:22:04] today an expression of an expression
[1:22:06] you're the continuation of that same
[1:22:10] Creation in John 1 and 1.
[1:22:13] you're literally the continuation of the
[1:22:17] expression of God so you have an eternal
[1:22:20] purpose
[1:22:21] because you was the manifestation of an
[1:22:23] attribute that was in God that thought
[1:22:25] of you and expressed you watch it and he
[1:22:27] made a earth to take you out of and to
[1:22:30] make you a human being now here we go
[1:22:33] sin come along
[1:22:36] and perverted his way
[1:22:40] you come in here
[1:22:43] you come anyhow but you was lost with
[1:22:46] the world
[1:22:47] so he come and redeemed you the express
[1:22:52] attribute and also redeems this Earth by
[1:22:56] the same way then his purpose rolls on
[1:23:00] see oh Hallelujah Prophet says oh that
[1:23:04] does me so much good think of just what
[1:23:07] lays ahead
[1:23:09] his purpose rolls On and On You Came
[1:23:13] From God as an expression
[1:23:15] but you can't be born lost but then
[1:23:17] Jesus came and died for you then you
[1:23:20] accept his life and you become a new
[1:23:22] creation and then he redeems you all
[1:23:24] back at the end when it's all over and
[1:23:27] redeems us back to glory and then the
[1:23:29] purpose rolls on and rolls on and rolls
[1:23:31] on and we realize this life was just an
[1:23:33] interruption to a life I already had oh
[1:23:36] my God and this is the Beauty and the
[1:23:39] love of God this is why Calvary is so
[1:23:41] important this is why that book being
[1:23:43] claimed was so important that book had
[1:23:45] my name and your name in it
[1:23:47] Hallelujah this is why the devil can't
[1:23:50] stop us
[1:23:51] because he cannot stop the word of God
[1:23:56] I have partaken of it listen friends I'm
[1:23:58] here to tell you I'm a witness I have
[1:24:00] partaken of the tree of life and I
[1:24:03] didn't fall no I did the opposite I've
[1:24:06] been redeemed back to God
[1:24:08] it didn't bring me death it brought me
[1:24:10] life he's rebuilding Eden
[1:24:16] Satan
[1:24:18] in the serpent
[1:24:22] preached to Eve
[1:24:25] about the tree of knowledge
[1:24:30] it took everything from her
[1:24:35] it took everything she cared about
[1:24:39] everything she loved
[1:24:41] Satan
[1:24:43] preached
[1:24:44] through a serpent and she fell for it
[1:24:48] and it took everything from her
[1:24:52] that she loved
[1:24:56] tonight
[1:24:59] spirit of God
[1:25:01] not Satan
[1:25:03] it's not Satan preaching through a
[1:25:06] serpent to persuade you to death
[1:25:09] it's a minister of the Gospel with the
[1:25:13] spirit of God preaching to you about a
[1:25:16] tree of life
[1:25:18] it's me trying to persuade you there's
[1:25:20] no death there's no death here friends
[1:25:22] this is the beauty of it I I want to
[1:25:25] tell you something today this is the
[1:25:27] beauty of what we're believing
[1:25:29] you're not coming into this building and
[1:25:32] hearing Satan through a serpent deceive
[1:25:34] you you're hearing you're hearing the
[1:25:37] spirit of God not Satan hearing the
[1:25:39] spirit of God not through a serpent
[1:25:41] through a preacher through a gospel
[1:25:42] preacher
[1:25:43] and what am I doing I'm not taking it a
[1:25:46] death I'm taking it a life
[1:25:48] Hallelujah
[1:25:50] God has already sacrificed his life on
[1:25:53] your behalf
[1:25:54] this is exactly why when the death angel
[1:25:57] comes in this age he has to pass your
[1:25:59] homes why because the token is applied
[1:26:00] the Holy Ghost is there that's what
[1:26:02] happened in the first Exodus
[1:26:04] he said you'll have a land you've got to
[1:26:06] put the blood over the over the post in
[1:26:08] the door
[1:26:09] and you understand that the blood had a
[1:26:12] voice that spoke and when the death
[1:26:15] angel came to the door of an Israelite
[1:26:18] and he saw that blood
[1:26:21] a voice spoke to him and said there's
[1:26:25] already been a death here move on
[1:26:28] and he moves on I'm here to tell you the
[1:26:30] death angel is going through the land
[1:26:32] tonight but when he comes to my house
[1:26:34] when it comes to your house he sees the
[1:26:36] blood and he has to just keep on walking
[1:26:39] he's not going to get God's family we're
[1:26:42] leaving Egypt Hallelujah
[1:26:46] this is the bridge friend this is what
[1:26:48] I'm trying to get you to understand God
[1:26:49] is rebuilding Eden and you're part of it
[1:26:54] and the devil finds that he is
[1:26:59] powerless
[1:27:00] powerless
[1:27:02] you know what he could do and what he
[1:27:04] couldn't do
[1:27:05] he could and did deceive Eve he couldn't
[1:27:10] and didn't deceive Adam
[1:27:14] he
[1:27:15] he once he became convinced he pulled
[1:27:20] her right in
[1:27:21] but what he couldn't do was he couldn't
[1:27:23] stop Adam from walking out with her
[1:27:26] oh my and when God saw that love that
[1:27:30] human love between a man and a woman and
[1:27:33] those first little sweethearts God said
[1:27:36] oh that touches my heart someday I'm
[1:27:38] going to do the same thing Someday I'm
[1:27:40] gonna walk out with you I'm going to
[1:27:43] take the sting of death I'm going to
[1:27:45] take it into my body I'm going to go
[1:27:47] down to Hell and rip the keys out of
[1:27:49] Satan's hand and I'm gonna come back out
[1:27:51] of the grave
[1:27:53] and I'm going to have freedom for all my
[1:27:56] family oh my goodness friends that's
[1:27:59] where we are tonight Hallelujah to
[1:28:01] believe that
[1:28:02] stand with me amen God bless you
[1:28:05] my

[1:28:17] Hallelujah and glory to God the blood's
[1:28:21] been applied God's spirit abides let the
[1:28:25] death angel pass you believe that

[1:28:52] I thank you for helping me Lord it was
[1:28:55] all day back and forth back and forth
[1:28:57] trying to figure out how to explain this
[1:29:00] concept
[1:29:01] how to make it so the people could catch
[1:29:03] it and
[1:29:04] I'm so glad I had the assistance of an
[1:29:07] eagle Prophet to help me put it into
[1:29:08] wording that Eagles can understand
[1:29:11] Lord we're Believers tonight we're
[1:29:13] Believers my goodness we're believers

[1:29:18] been more happy of anything in my life
[1:29:21] I am a believer of your word
[1:29:24] and when I hear tonight how it all
[1:29:26] started and how it went and how you
[1:29:29] recovered it and how you saved us and
[1:29:31] your plans for redeeming and it's
[1:29:34] already underway and I've already
[1:29:36] experienced it
[1:29:38] I'm not here tonight just preaching an
[1:29:40] imaginary Tale
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:44] this isn't some epic fiction
[1:29:47] some epic drama fiction man-made
[1:29:50] creation
[1:29:52] this is real
[1:29:55] there was a a great being
[1:29:57] who filled all time space and Eternity
[1:30:01] he thought of me he thought of us he
[1:30:03] thought of a world he thought of himself
[1:30:05] as a father
[1:30:07] he thought of himself as a king of a
[1:30:10] great Kingdom
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:12] he moves into a form almost like a
[1:30:15] little boy moving around drawing
[1:30:16] pictures
[1:30:18] he's starting he's coming forward
[1:30:20] millions of years he's creating
[1:30:23] universes the universe with galaxies
[1:30:26] after Galaxy after Galaxy after Galaxy
[1:30:29] star after star billions and billions
[1:30:33] and billions of them
[1:30:36] with all of their great scientific
[1:30:39] achievement there and they're just about
[1:30:41] maxed out now Lord they're at the end
[1:30:44] technology and science can't go too much
[1:30:46] further Lord we already have the last
[1:30:49] technological feat that a prophet saw
[1:30:52] before the world was destroyed he saw
[1:30:54] driverless cars
[1:30:55] that's being implemented every day Lord
[1:30:58] it grows a little more and a little more
[1:30:59] and a little more
[1:31:01] he didn't see colonies on Mars and
[1:31:04] colonies on the moon he didn't see any
[1:31:06] of that he said I saw driverless cars
[1:31:09] and then after that I saw the world
[1:31:10] blown to pieces
[1:31:13] we know Lord that
[1:31:15] the Earth with its maxed out science
[1:31:18] [Music]
[1:31:20] it can't even chart it can't it's it
[1:31:22] they they know
[1:31:24] that there's more galaxies and stars
[1:31:27] that they can see
[1:31:30] that they can't even count or get their
[1:31:32] mind around
[1:31:34] to say nothing of the what they can't
[1:31:36] see beyond the beyond the Beyond of the
[1:31:40] Beyond
[1:31:41] and every time they get a a new lens a
[1:31:44] new advancement they shine it on a dark
[1:31:47] spot in space and after no time they see
[1:31:50] whole new galaxies again going further
[1:31:52] and further and further and further and
[1:31:54] further
[1:31:56] it's endless
[1:31:58] and this is the great God that great
[1:32:00] Fountain who built it all
[1:32:03] and wants to share he wants to share
[1:32:06] this being wants to share his eternal
[1:32:10] life
[1:32:12] with people
[1:32:14] I pray tonight Lord God
[1:32:16] that you'll let us see the value in that
[1:32:19] tree of life
[1:32:21] let us move away from that one percent
[1:32:24] of error

[1:45:00] amen praise the Lord
[1:45:03] I want to give you this testimony
[1:45:06] uh from brother Joe Carter
[1:45:10] he um he has
[1:45:12] grandkids tonight he couldn't get here
[1:45:14] is to watch and uh but brother Joe even
[1:45:17] if he can't make it on Wednesday he
[1:45:19] always shows up on Thursday it's a good
[1:45:21] thing too because we have him on our
[1:45:22] list and we always pray for him the
[1:45:24] whole brother's lock on our permanent
[1:45:26] list and as you all know brother Joe had
[1:45:29] a had a shocking thing where
[1:45:32] he went and had some tests run and they
[1:45:35] he had massive blockages everywhere they
[1:45:38] actually gave him almost like emergency
[1:45:40] medication said you could have a stroke
[1:45:42] any minute and he had uh blockages in
[1:45:46] two different areas of his body I think
[1:45:47] one around his heart one and More in his
[1:45:50] neck and they were worried about heart
[1:45:51] attacks they're worried about strokes
[1:45:53] and they just pumped the Brother full of
[1:45:55] all kinds of meds but we've been praying
[1:45:57] for him and brother Joe went to MUSC
[1:46:00] today said at my appointment with the
[1:46:03] neurologist at MUSC because they had to
[1:46:05] look at all those veins leading to his
[1:46:07] brain
[1:46:08] they did a split screen with my chart
[1:46:10] and showed me the layers of my vertebral
[1:46:13] arteries and told me that she can see
[1:46:18] absolutely no blockage whatsoever
[1:46:20] and then to the arteries going up my
[1:46:23] neck I am completely clear she does not
[1:46:27] understand it she can't explain it to me
[1:46:29] she read the dictation of the doctor
[1:46:32] that was on that night along with the
[1:46:34] CAT scan done and found the blockages
[1:46:37] she does she said he said she sees tiny
[1:46:40] spots and other low in other different
[1:46:43] places areas but she said that she would
[1:46:46] uh she would not be at all concerned
[1:46:49] about it because if she looked she said
[1:46:51] if I looked I could find that in just
[1:46:54] about every person my age man or woman
[1:46:56] so he just has the natural things that
[1:46:58] they would see for a man's age
[1:47:00] see and he says but as to any blockages
[1:47:04] in the vertebral arteries she sees
[1:47:06] nothing at all
[1:47:08] told me to feel free and follow up with
[1:47:11] the vascular doctor if I did not feel
[1:47:13] comfortable with her decision this woman
[1:47:16] is the top expert
[1:47:18] she's done 160 of these procedures and
[1:47:22] and and and these other doctors send
[1:47:24] these terrible cases to her and she told
[1:47:27] Joe she said this is the first time in
[1:47:29] 160 surgeries they've sent me a patient
[1:47:32] and I'm deciding you don't need surgery
[1:47:34] foreign
[1:47:36] you can go see him if you want to uh she
[1:47:40] said that decision be totally up to me I
[1:47:42] told her no I trust you 100 I have no
[1:47:45] reason not to trust uh you uh that I
[1:47:48] simply believe I was healed so I was I
[1:47:51] told I was told not to worry about a
[1:47:54] stroke or even refilling any medicines
[1:47:56] they were given to me the night of the
[1:47:58] incident the case is closed today thank
[1:48:01] the Lord
[1:48:02] oh God
[1:48:08] so they've got Specialists that can see
[1:48:10] them in CAT scans that can see them and
[1:48:12] now the chief specialist looks again and
[1:48:14] says there's nothing there
[1:48:16] oh God still moves friends God moves
[1:48:19] Prayer Changes Things
[1:48:21] don't lose sight of that prayer changes
[1:48:24] everything
[1:48:25] you have access to God through prayer in
[1:48:29] the name of Jesus Christ amen any test
[1:48:32] any other testimonies brother John use

[1:48:40] I just want to thank the Lord for
[1:48:42] perfect eyesight amen when brother Daryl
[1:48:44] was here you know for years been
[1:48:47] struggling well struggling it's not
[1:48:48] debilitating but
[1:48:51] um I've had a stigmatism in my eyes you
[1:48:54] know it's hard to see street signs and
[1:48:55] things
[1:48:56] and a while a couple years ago I went
[1:48:59] and got contacts and was using those and
[1:49:02] you know it's kind of a little
[1:49:03] irritating we'll come to find out they
[1:49:05] were irritating my eyes
[1:49:07] and so I had to try to get them changed
[1:49:09] they tried several different ones they
[1:49:11] either
[1:49:12] wouldn't work mice wouldn't rotate one
[1:49:14] of them or they would irritate my eyes
[1:49:17] even worse
[1:49:18] and I can't wear glasses it's just
[1:49:20] impossible dirty and sweaty and so when
[1:49:23] brother Daryl was preaching it had been
[1:49:25] on my heart since I realized that I
[1:49:27] couldn't wear contacts was like you know
[1:49:29] I know the Lord can heal me this that's
[1:49:31] nothing to him
[1:49:32] and um when brother Daryl was preaching
[1:49:35] I just in my heart I just like Lord
[1:49:38] I feel like this is
[1:49:41] you've healed me I know this is your
[1:49:43] word and I'm I'm taking you at your work
