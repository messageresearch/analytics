[31:50] them, but I appreciated the ones that we
[31:52] had, but of course, I loved all the
[31:53] singing quite naturally. Amen. Praise
[31:56] God. Whoops, wrong thing.
[31:59] Amen. Going to invite you to Matthew
[32:02] chapter 2 and we're going to look at
[32:04] those first 12 verses. Amen. I saw
[32:07] brother Tony make you turn around and
[32:09] shake hands so I won't do it again. But
[32:10] [laughter]
[32:11] Amen. While you're finding your place in
[32:13] Matthew chapter 2, I might just make a
[32:16] few quick announcements. Um just one
[32:19] quick announcement. There will be no
[32:21] midweek service
[32:23] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[32:23] &gt;&gt; uh this week with the holidays upon us.
[32:26] And um I'd like to say today that I've
[32:29] been looking forward to seeing the
[32:32] children's Sunday school class give us
[32:35] our annual Christmas play ever since Joy
[32:38] sent me the script. Amen. For my
[32:40] approval and um that's been underway.
[32:43] And so much thanks go to Sister Joy and
[32:45] to all the other sisters. I know there
[32:47] was a whole team of them uh helping um
[32:51] be or at least involved in all of that.
[32:53] Amen. From the very start. I love little
[32:55] children.
[32:57] I'm just crazy about them. And um it's
[33:01] Sundays and Wednesdays to see their
[33:03] little smiling faces. My goodness. It's
[33:05] a it's a highlight of my life. Sister
[33:07] Debbie, same way. Some of them stare at
[33:10] me to distraction.
[33:14] [laughter]
[33:15] Amen. Make it difficult for me to keep
[33:17] my concentration. But um and then and
[33:21] then others of them uh help me preach
[33:24] loud [laughter]
[33:27] and uh I'm constantly finding that
[33:29] sometimes I have to try to outshout
[33:31] them. [laughter] Amen. Um want to say
[33:34] that the fellowship hall is reopened for
[33:36] the present at least until uh renovation
[33:40] picks back up which is um which I do
[33:42] plan to turn my full attention um to it
[33:46] back to it in the coming new year.
[33:48] [sighs]
[33:49] Wow. My sudden, our sudden, Sister
[33:51] Debbie and I are sudden and u rather
[33:54] arduous move is just about wrapped up
[33:57] [clears throat] with mostly just some
[33:59] things to do on the outside. And uh
[34:01] Sister Debbie is still alive.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; I haven't set her to the curb.
[34:07] [laughter]
[34:08] Amen. But like the Apostle Paul, there
[34:10] were a few times I despared of life.
[34:12] [laughter]
[34:16] But we made it. [laughter]
[34:18] Hallelujah. It's been a lot and I'm very
[34:20] grateful to uh to all who have helped
[34:24] Sister Debbie and I make that
[34:25] transition. We had far more help than we
[34:28] could take advantage of, help offered to
[34:30] us than we could take advantage of, but
[34:33] it certainly warms our heart for all of
[34:36] the offers of help that came in. Amen. I
[34:39] just have a little bit of u stuff on the
[34:41] front porch and u some extra landscaping
[34:44] and Sister Debbie's never ending list.
[34:46] Amen. And it's the call it the
[34:48] everlasting list. It's been going for 43
[34:50] years. Man, it didn't start on this
[34:52] house. Amen. Every husband should say,
[34:54] "Amen."
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And every woman should say, "Don't
[34:58] forget it." [laughter]
[35:01] Amen. But once I have um those few
[35:04] outside items, the brothers and I will
[35:06] move our focus uh very quickly back to
[35:08] the fellowship hall. actually never left
[35:11] our discussions and we're continuing to
[35:13] set things in motion
[35:16] today. Um, with the fellow having said
[35:18] the fellowship hall is open, sister
[35:19] Debbie and I will be having some time
[35:21] with our family over here uh in our new
[35:24] home. So, we actually won't be in the
[35:26] fellowship hall today, but it is open
[35:28] for use and we [clears throat] do plan
[35:30] to pick right back up where we left off
[35:33] with Sunday afternoon fellowship. That's
[35:35] been a hallmark for this church for 30
[35:37] plus years. And it keeps us close to one
[35:40] another. And I love it. And it's
[35:42] remarkable. We get the most remarks out
[35:44] of that. I get more remarks out of
[35:46] people visiting and seeing the spirit
[35:49] you have in the fellowship hall more
[35:51] than they say about my sermon. And I'm
[35:53] okay with that because I realize that's
[35:55] a product of the preaching. Amen. Praise
[35:58] the Lord. Amen. All hearts clear. Let's
[36:00] look at our at our scripture this
[36:02] morning. Matthew chapter 2.
[36:06] And I want to uh speak to you this
[36:09] morning taking a title, [clears throat]
[36:11] The Wise Men's Journey,
[36:13] Chapter 2. We'll catch these first 12
[36:15] verses and let you be seated. Once I'm
[36:17] done, Brother Matt will come up for a
[36:18] little intermission of singing while
[36:20] Sister Joy and and other sisters get
[36:22] them into their costumes and then it's
[36:26] Amen. So, I'm looking forward to that.
[36:28] Uh chapter 2, verse one. [clears throat]
[36:32] Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[36:34] Judea in the days of Herod the king,
[36:37] behold, there came wise men from the
[36:39] east to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he
[36:42] that is born king of the Jews? For we
[36:45] have seen his star in the east, and are
[36:48] come to worship him."
[36:51] When Herod the king had heard these
[36:52] things, he was troubled, and all
[36:54] Jerusalem with him." That's a pretty
[36:55] shocking statement. And when he had
[36:58] gathered all the chief priests and
[37:00] scribes of the people together, he
[37:02] demanded of them where Christ should be
[37:04] born. And they said unto him, "In
[37:05] Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is
[37:09] written by the prophet, and thou
[37:10] Bethlehem, in the land of Judea, art not
[37:14] the least among the princes of Judah.
[37:16] For out of thee shall come a governor
[37:19] that shall rule my people Israel."
[37:22] Then Herod, when he had privately called
[37:24] the wise men, inquired of them
[37:26] diligently what time the star appeared.
[37:29] And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said,
[37:32] "Go and search diligently for the young
[37:34] child. And when you have found him,
[37:36] bring me word again that I may come and
[37:38] worship him also." When they had heard
[37:41] the king, they departed. And lo, the
[37:43] star which they saw in the east went
[37:46] before them till it came and stood over
[37:48] where the young child was. When they saw
[37:52] the star, they rejoiced with exceeding
[37:54] great joy. And when they were come into
[37:57] the house, they saw the young child with
[38:00] Mary, his mother. You remember this
[38:02] wasn't the manger scene. This is after
[38:05] Jesus has been evacuated to Egypt and
[38:07] back and he's about two years old. So
[38:11] they were coming to the house. They saw
[38:12] the young child with Mary his mother and
[38:15] fell down and worshiped him. And when
[38:18] they had opened their treasures, they
[38:20] presented unto him gold and frankincense
[38:22] and myrr. And being warned of God in a
[38:24] dream that they should not return to
[38:26] Herod, they departed into their own
[38:28] country another way. [clears throat]
[38:32] Let's pray. Father, we thank you for
[38:35] your word today. These are this is a
[38:37] story that we've read, Lord, everyone in
[38:40] here, Lord, since the days when we were
[38:42] children in Sunday school and at home.
[38:44] And master, we're looking today for
[38:47] fresh insight to this story, this
[38:50] journey of the wise men. Lord, may we
[38:53] find the applications to our life. For
[38:55] every word of God is given for
[38:58] instruction. every word, all the
[39:00] stories, all the allegorories,
[39:02] everything is given for our
[39:03] instructions. It's profitable, Lord, for
[39:05] doctrine and teaching. And so we pray
[39:08] today that you will help us now to
[39:11] follow the leadership of the Holy
[39:13] Spirit. Commit it to you in Jesus name.
[39:16] Amen. God bless you friends. You can be
[39:18] seated.
[39:34] I have a a small um I guess you'd call
[39:39] it like a news feed that I subscribe to
[39:42] and it saves me in the morning sometimes
[39:46] if I want to just make sure the world
[39:48] isn't ending and I check the quick
[39:50] headlines. It gives me just a quick
[39:51] rundown of the of the important stuff.
[39:54] Saves me chasing all over the internet,
[39:55] which I don't want to be doing in the
[39:58] morning uh when that's my time for my
[40:00] devotional. So, uh they had an
[40:03] interesting letter today published I
[40:06] thought was interesting and it said the
[40:08] meaning of Christmas
[40:11] and it says this. Christmas is a
[40:13] Christian holiday celebrating the belief
[40:15] in God's birth as a first century Judean
[40:19] man, Jesus Christ, celebrated each year
[40:22] on December 25. Faithful observers
[40:26] believe the all powerful uncreated God
[40:29] became incarnate to redeem humanity from
[40:32] a fallen state by dying and rising again
[40:35] at Easter. I'd say amen to that. In
[40:38] recent centuries, the religious feast
[40:41] expanded into a major holiday season of
[40:44] giftgiving celebrated by an estimated
[40:47] 2.6 billion people worldwide. Its timing
[40:51] and many of its customs trace back to an
[40:54] ancient seasonal festival such as uh
[40:58] Satnelia and Ule. You'll hear Ule tide.
[41:00] That's where that comes from. When
[41:02] communities in Europe celebrated the
[41:05] winter solstice, as Christianity spread
[41:08] through the continent in the 4th
[41:09] century, church leaders placed Christmas
[41:12] on December 25 and adopted some of these
[41:15] longstanding traditions. Amid the
[41:18] holidays gradual secularization, the
[41:21] legend of St. Nicholas's giftgiving and
[41:24] the Dutch tradition of Santa Claus
[41:27] helped shape the modern con conception
[41:29] of Santa Claus. what we've uh customs,
[41:33] it goes on, customs solidified in
[41:36] Victorian England, transformed Christmas
[41:39] into the family centered celebration
[41:41] recognized today, popularizing Christmas
[41:45] trees, cards, and carols. The holiday
[41:48] season brings in, you ready for this?
[41:51] Nearly $1 trillion in revenue for US
[41:56] retailers alone.
[41:59] US retailers alone.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[42:02] &gt;&gt; you know, when we when we look at this
[42:06] subject, uh, I I I I did a little bit of
[42:10] a deep dive on the position of the
[42:12] messengers and how they spoke to these
[42:15] things. And you can see why Brother
[42:19] Brandham was so against the
[42:21] commercialization
[42:22] of Christmas and that stuck in his crawl
[42:25] his entire ministry and he never
[42:28] relinquished that. uh he he talks about
[42:31] you know taking away the sacredness of
[42:33] it and he was perfectly aware. I just
[42:36] think it's interesting in 2025 they
[42:38] print an article that is exactly what a
[42:40] prophet was trying to tell the Christian
[42:42] world 40 50 years ago that it's not in
[42:45] no way the birth of Christ. It was it
[42:47] was festivals and feast days and and
[42:50] seasons and winter solstice and they
[42:52] adopted that into the Christian and then
[42:54] they hit the whole Chris Kringle Santa
[42:56] Claus thing. And he says, "Don't tell
[42:58] your children that there's a Santa Claus
[43:01] because someday you'll have to tell them
[43:02] there's not or they'll find out there's
[43:04] not." And then their next question will
[43:07] naturally be and you won't be able to
[43:09] fault them for it. Well, what about this
[43:11] Jesus you tell me about? Maybe he's not
[43:13] real uh either. Can I get some water,
[43:16] Brother Tony? Thank you. Amen. So, so
[43:20] looking back, uh you know, you don't you
[43:22] don't have the Apostle Paul um speaking
[43:26] a whole lot uh about a Christmas holiday
[43:29] as you as you would well imagine because
[43:31] it wasn't really adopted into the
[43:33] Christian church until around the 4th
[43:34] century. But Paul did have some things
[43:37] to say about it
[43:39] or about it in general. In Colossians
[43:42] 2:es 13-17,
[43:45] Paul says, "And you being dead in your
[43:47] sins and the uncircumcision of your
[43:49] flesh, hath he quickened together with
[43:52] him,
[43:54] having [clears throat] forgiven you all
[43:55] trespasses." Aren't you glad for that?
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. blotting out the handwriting of
[44:00] ordinances that was against us, which
[44:03] was contrary to us, and took it out of
[44:06] the way, nailing it to his cross. And
[44:09] having spoiled principalities and
[44:11] powers, he spoiled the devil's plans for
[44:14] you.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; I think that's a good thing as a
[44:17] Christmas present. He spoiled the
[44:19] devil's plans for me.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. and having spoiled principalities
[44:23] and powers, he made a show of them
[44:26] openly, triumphing over them in it. Let
[44:29] no man, Paul says, therefore judge you
[44:31] in meat or in drink or in respect of a
[44:34] holy day or of a new moon or of the
[44:36] Sabbath days, which are a shadow of
[44:38] things to come, but the body is of
[44:41] Christ. So Paul is speaking about the
[44:44] liberty that we have as mature
[44:45] Christians that we live in the world.
[44:48] We're not of the world, but we do live
[44:50] here. And we are supposed to conduct our
[44:52] lives as though not like we live off the
[44:55] world or in a commune. Uh when Paul
[44:58] writes to one of the churches, I believe
[45:00] in the Galatian church, if I'm not
[45:01] mistaken, that might stand correction
[45:04] about, you know, having nothing to do
[45:06] with the world. And they write back to
[45:08] him, which was the which was the
[45:10] foundation of his second letter. And
[45:12] their their question, one of their
[45:13] questions was, "You said we should have
[45:15] nothing to do with the world, but how do
[45:17] we pull this off? We have jobs, we have
[45:20] careers, our kids are in school, we work
[45:22] in the markets." And Paul writes back to
[45:25] clarify saying that, you know, when I
[45:27] said to you before that you should, you
[45:29] know, have nothing to do with the world,
[45:32] you know, it's it's evident that to have
[45:36] absolutely nothing to do with the world,
[45:38] you would have to go out of the world.
[45:41] And many have done that. They've went
[45:43] into communes. But that's not what the
[45:45] gospel came to do. The gospel came to
[45:48] for to send you out as sheep among
[45:50] wolves with the Holy Ghost as your
[45:53] guide. And that's how the world um
[45:55] because it's not shepherds that bring
[45:57] forth sheep. Sheep bring forth sheep.
[46:00] And so I I stand up here and preach to
[46:03] you and dress you in the garments of the
[46:05] word, but it is your job along with me
[46:08] to be out there preaching the gospel in
[46:10] your lived lives.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; SO PAUL IS SIMPLY saying we're free from
[46:16] these things. Uh we're we're not going
[46:18] to allow people to judge us because we
[46:20] didn't go live in a commune and and we
[46:22] we have to have jobs and careers and
[46:25] things like that and we have to know
[46:26] people and associate with the works of
[46:28] darkness. sometimes it can't be avoided.
[46:31] Uh you're going to be sometimes our law
[46:33] enforcement brothers, I've had it even
[46:35] even in law enforcement as chaplain
[46:37] where you sometimes you're you're
[46:39] literally hands-on with people and you
[46:41] can't avoid it. And so you know the
[46:43] these are the things that we live by.
[46:45] PAUL COMES BACK TO Galatians in in
[46:48] chapter 4:es 9 to1 11 and you say,
[46:51] "Brother Jason, what does all this have
[46:53] to do with the season we're in?" You'll
[46:54] just hang on. So Galatians 4 9-11. But
[46:58] now, after that ye have known God, or
[47:01] rather are known of God, how turn ye
[47:05] again to the weak and beggarly elements,
[47:08] where to you desire again to be in
[47:10] bondage. You got out of the world. Why
[47:11] you trying to get back in it?
[47:14] &gt;&gt; You know, God, one of the problems with
[47:16] that, God took exception to Hezekiah.
[47:19] King Hezekiah got him in a lot of
[47:20] trouble. God asked him a question. Why
[47:23] is it that you're always making my
[47:25] enemies your friends?
[47:27] So God watches that sea and we we're in
[47:30] the world but we're not of the world.
[47:32] We're supposed to be different from the
[47:34] world. IF YOU'RE NOT, THEN HOW ARE YOU A
[47:36] LIGHTHOUSE TO OFFER THEM ANYTHING
[47:38] DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY SEE?
[47:41] &gt;&gt; SO SO PAUL GOES ON. HE SAYS, "How how do
[47:45] you turn again the weak and beggarly
[47:46] elements where you desire again to be in
[47:48] bondage?" Verse 10, you observe days and
[47:51] months and times and years, AND I'M
[47:54] AFRAID OF YOU, LEST I HAVE BESTOWED UPON
[47:56] YOU labor in vain. Now, I'm enough of a
[48:00] Bible student to realize those two texts
[48:02] don't don't um perfectly compare, but
[48:06] but really, THAT'S NOT MY POINT. UM I'M
[48:08] NOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE A POINT TO
[48:10] COMPARE THEM SO MUCH is is that my point
[48:12] is is that when I read Paul, I read a
[48:16] constant emphasis on balance. Yeah.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; You know, I WANT TO SAY THAT ONE DITCH
[48:22] IS JUST AS BAD AS THE OTHER DITCH.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; And we have too much of that going on.
[48:27] AND COULD I ADVOCATE for brother Paul
[48:30] today uh by saying THAT YOU KNOW BY
[48:34] SAYING YOU SHOULDN'T LIVE IN ANY DITCH.
[48:36] AMEN.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; SEE, balance in the word of God is where
[48:41] you will be most effective in witnessing
[48:44] to your loved ones, to your neighbors,
[48:47] to people on the job who you work with.
[48:49] BALANCE IS WHERE YOU'LL FIND peace that
[48:52] passes understanding. Balance is where
[48:55] you will achieve the fullness of joy
[48:57] that your joy may be full.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:02] He says in Galatians 3:2, "This only
[49:06] what I learn of you." SO, YOU KNOW,
[49:08] WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO SAY, you
[49:11] know, YOU GOT THIS GROUP JUDGING THIS
[49:13] GROUP AND THIS GROUP CONDESCENDING TO
[49:15] THIS GROUP, AND PAUL IS SO AGAINST THAT,
[49:17] and and we're FREE FROM THE WORLD. WE'RE
[49:19] NOT TRYING TO BE ATTACHED BACK TO THE
[49:21] WORLD, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I'M FREE,
[49:23] AND I I DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN A COMMUNE
[49:25] OR FOLLOW UH UH YOUR LIST OF RULES.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. PAUL SAYS, "THIS ONLY WOULD I
[49:32] LEARN OF YOU." COULD I SAY TODAY, "THIS
[49:34] ONLY IN WHATEVER OPINION that you HAVE
[49:36] ABOUT THIS HOLIDAY SEASON OR ANY HOLIDAY
[49:39] SEASON OR LIFE TOMORROW OR LIFE NEXT
[49:41] NEXT YEAR, THIS ONLY WHAT I LEARN OF
[49:44] YOU. RECEIVED ye the spirit by the works
[49:47] OF THE LAW OR BY HEARING OF FAITH."
[49:51] &gt;&gt; SEE, you've entrusted this ministry and
[49:54] this ministry team for many years with
[49:58] the souls of your family. And so if this
[50:00] ministry, you know, team, uh, this Bethl
[50:04] ministry team, I think if we're known
[50:07] for anything at all, uh, we're known for
[50:10] A AN ESTABLISHMENT AND A balance in
[50:14] God's word. And I I TAKE A LOT of a lot
[50:17] of joy in that that I've that NOT ONLY
[50:20] IS IT MY VISION, BUT IT'S THE VISION OF
[50:22] MY MINISTRY TEAM WHO HAVE ADOPTED THAT
[50:24] BALANCE IN THE WORD OF GOD. SEE,
[50:29] mentions or references to church history
[50:31] today will be very brief because I'm
[50:34] actually not preaching this morning on
[50:36] the celebration of church holidays such
[50:38] as Christmas or Easter or even the
[50:41] Sabbath, which are subjects in and of
[50:43] themselves. Uh I'm actually preparing a
[50:46] a rather deep dive essay on those
[50:48] elements in church history from the
[50:50] earliest times, tracking it to the
[50:51] present day day. But for today, I have a
[50:54] different burden on my heart for a
[50:57] Christmas message this year. Um,
[51:01] you know, just to speak briefly of the
[51:04] history and it was very enlightening. uh
[51:07] as I BEGIN TO DIVE DEEP ON IT, you you
[51:10] almost have to jump forward beyond
[51:13] Ireanius uh all the way to Martin and
[51:16] and heading into Columbus because it
[51:18] wasn't until the 4th century that these
[51:21] kinds of holidays. NOW, I'M NOT SAYING
[51:22] THAT THEY WEREN'T, YOU KNOW, ALL KINDS
[51:24] OF PAGAN HOLIDAYS going on there. THAT'S
[51:27] THAT WAS ROME
[51:28] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. And so, THE
[51:30] CHURCH ALREADY HAD THE SPIRIT OF
[51:31] ANTICHRIST WORKING IN IT. SO, IT'S
[51:33] ALWAYS BEEN it's not an end time WHERE
[51:36] THE IT'S NOT JUST THE LAST AGE FACES THE
[51:38] ANTICHRIST. Every age has faced it. See?
[51:41] AND SO, THEY'VE ALWAYS HAD TO NAVIGATE
[51:44] WHERE THEY COME DOWN ON HOW DO WE
[51:47] CONDUCT OURSELVES TO LIVE IN THE WORLD
[51:49] BUT NOT BE OF THE WORLD.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; It's always BEEN A CHALLENGE AND IT'S A
[51:53] IT'S SOMEWHAT OF A MOVING TARGET. NOT
[51:55] BECAUSE THE WORD MOVES, BUT BECAUSE THE
[51:57] AGE MOVES AND NEW things appear. AND AND
[52:01] SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET HELP FROM FROM
[52:02] FROM YESTER YEAR. THEN SOMETIMES YOU'VE
[52:05] GOT TO HAVE A RIGHT NOW WORD. SOMETIMES
[52:07] YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A THUS SAYETH THE
[52:08] LORD TO MOVE ASIDE ALL THE MAN-MADE
[52:10] DEBRIS. AND I'M GLAD TO HAVE THAT.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [sighs]
[52:15] &gt;&gt; There's no record where Irenius
[52:17] explicitly opposed the CELEBRATION OF
[52:20] ANY KIND OF A CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY. um
[52:23] rather the absence of his commentary
[52:26] would suggest THAT IT WAS SIMPLY NOT A
[52:28] CONCERN because it wasn't a practice at
[52:30] that time. If you go ON PAST COLUMBBO,
[52:32] YOU FIND THE SAME THING even when you
[52:34] come to Martin Luther. NOW, BY THE TIME
[52:36] YOU GET TO LUTHER, IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED
[52:38] in the Christian church. And actually,
[52:40] Luther publicly supported it to a large
[52:43] degree uh not only Christmas but Easter
[52:46] uh during the early years of his
[52:48] reformation. In fact, he actually
[52:51] enriched uh uh he actually enriched
[52:54] Christmas traditions and even wrote
[52:57] carols. SEE OUR CHURCH AGE messenger and
[53:01] and and HE BUT BUT BUT ALWAYS ONE THEME
[53:04] HERE'S ONE THEME THAT I FOUND ACROSS ALL
[53:06] OF THEM AND I'M NOT GETTING INTO the
[53:08] trenches of it today. They all none OF
[53:11] THEM NONE OF OUR MESSENGERS FROM PAUL TO
[53:14] BROTHER BRANDHAM UM PREACHED A
[53:17] PROHIBITION AGAINST CERTAIN ARTICLES OF
[53:19] THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY. BUT WHAT THEY ALL
[53:22] HAD IN COMMON WAS THAT IT THAT THAT'S
[53:25] JUST A A SIDE THING. WHAT YOU REALLY
[53:27] OUGHT TO DO IS LOOK AT IT AS A SPIRITUAL
[53:29] TIME TO GROW CLOSE TO GOD AND USE THAT
[53:31] TIME WISELY TO WITNESS TO PEOPLE WHO
[53:34] OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BE OPEN TO IT.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; SEE, JUST LIKE JUST LIKE I IT WOULD BE I
[53:40] WOULD NEVER I WOULD never with the
[53:42] spirit of Christ say to uh a mother or a
[53:46] father, YOU BETTER SERVE THE LORD OR THE
[53:48] LORD MIGHT TAKE YOUR CHILD. HOW CRUEL
[53:50] WOULD THAT BE? ESPECIALLY IF IT CAME TO
[53:52] PASS. SEE, AND AND THERE have been men
[53:55] who sadly have used fear tactics LIKE
[53:58] THAT. BUT I ALSO WOULDN'T MISS AN
[54:00] OPPORTUNITY IF THE LORD SAW FIT TO TAKE
[54:02] A CHILD AND THAT PARENT'S HEART WAS
[54:04] TENDER AND BROKEN AT THAT MOMENT, I'D
[54:06] MOVE IN WITH THE GOSPEL. THAT'S WHY
[54:08] SISTER GINA IS SITTING HERE TODAY. THE
[54:10] LORD BROKE HER HEART AND AND AND SHE
[54:12] LOST A BABY. AND WHILE HER HEART WAS
[54:14] TENDER AND BROKEN LIKE THAT, THE HOLY
[54:16] SPIRIT GOT A HOLD OF HER AND MY DAD.
[54:18] AMEN.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO SO THIS THIS WAS Luther's uh
[54:22] thinking. The Wesley carried ON WITH THE
[54:26] EXACT SAME THING. HE DIDN'T OPPOSE IT AT
[54:28] ALL. IN FACT, IS HIS BROTHER uh Charles
[54:31] uh Wesley also wrote Christmas carols.
[54:34] Uh they WERE ALL IT WASN'T, YOU KNOW,
[54:35] jingle bells and all that kind of
[54:37] nonsense of the world, but the sacred uh
[54:40] the sacred hymns. AND SO YOU YOU HAD A
[54:43] LOT OF UH MEN BACK IN THAT day uh
[54:46] writing tremendous music that almost
[54:48] takes your breath away. Handles
[54:50] Messiah's a beautiful piece of music and
[54:53] and THAT WAS HIS THAT WAS HIS WORSHIP to
[54:55] God as best he understood the Isuza
[54:58] revival fathers. Neither did they. I
[55:00] THOUGHT TO MYSELF, HOW DID IT GET IN
[55:03] INTO INTO some elements of America where
[55:07] there IS SUCH AN OPPOSITION THAT IT'S
[55:09] JUST IT'S JUST IT'S JUST ANATHEMA AND
[55:12] BECAUSE BECAUSE NONE OF THE MESSENGERS
[55:15] PRIOR TO LUTHER TALKED ABOUT IT DEROG IN
[55:18] A DEROGATORY WAY EVEN THE FESTIVALS THEY
[55:20] DID have and YOU KNOW JUST TO JUST TO
[55:23] KEEP YOUR BALANCE THAT WAS THEIR
[55:24] CONSTANT MESSAGE AND THEN WHEN YOU COME
[55:26] TO LUTHER AND YOU SAY WELL I BUT LUTHER
[55:28] ALSO DRANK BEER AND SMOKED THE PIPE BUT
[55:30] WESLEY DIDN'T.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; WESLEY WAS ARMENIAN AND VERY STRICT UH
[55:34] SANCTIFI SANCTIFIED LIVES AND HE DIDN'T
[55:36] PREACH AGAINST IT AT ALL. WESLEY ALSO
[55:39] HAD THE SAME THINKING. USE IT AS A TIME
[55:42] FOR SPIRITUAL RENEWAL. USE IT AS A TIME
[55:45] TO TO TO SHOW THE HUMILITY OF CHRIST AND
[55:48] THE LOVE OF GOD TO THE WORLD.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; The Isuz I thought, well, MAYBE THE THE
[55:53] EARLY PENTECOSTAL IS REVIVAL FATHERS DID
[55:56] THAT. They didn't. They didn't do it
[55:57] either. There's none OF THEIR WRITINGS
[55:59] IN DADDY SEYMOUR OR ANY OF THOSE GUYS UH
[56:03] AGAINST THOSE THINGS PER SE. THEY ALL
[56:05] HAD THE SAME uh idea THAT YOU KNOW JUST
[56:09] SEE IT FOR WHAT IT IS AND MAKE SURE YOU
[56:12] DON'T LOSE THE SACREDNESS OF IT. IT
[56:14] ACTUALLY WHEN I FOUND OUT HOW IT GOT TO
[56:16] THE UNITED STATES THROUGH THE THROUGH
[56:18] THE NEW ENGLAND COLONIES, IT CAME FROM
[56:19] THE PURITANS, A PURITAN MOVEMENT WHO
[56:22] ROSE UP BETWEEN LUTHER AND WESLEY IN
[56:24] ENGLAND DURING THE TIME OF CROMWELL AND
[56:26] THEY ACTUALLY OUTLAWED CHRISTMAS.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; THEY ACTUALLY WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO
[56:30] DO. THAT WAS A PURITAN MOVEMENT THAT
[56:31] CAME ACROSS AND GOT INTO THE NEW ENGLAND
[56:33] STATES AND WENT THROUGH AMERICA. AND
[56:35] THERE WERE CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES
[56:37] IN THE 1600S THAT OUTLAWED IT. SEE, BUT
[56:40] I MY POINT IS TO YOU THAT IT WASN'T IT
[56:43] WASN'T FROM YOUR MESSENGERS. IT WASN'T
[56:44] FROM PAUL THROUGH COLUMBA. IT WASN'T IN
[56:47] LUTHER. IT WASN'T IN WESLEY. IT WASN'T
[56:49] IN THE ISUZA FATHERS. BROTHER BRANDHAM
[56:51] WAS EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. BROTHER
[56:53] BRANDHAM UH CONTINUED WITH THESE SAME
[56:55] APPROACHES NOT ONLY TO CHRISTMAS BUT TO
[56:58] EASTER. BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD SAY IT
[57:00] LIKE THIS. HE WOULD SAY, "WHAT GOOD DOES
[57:02] IT DO YOU WHETHER YOU HAD LENT OR NOT
[57:04] LENT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE LIFE?" SATAN
[57:06] DOESN'T CARE HOW RELIGIOUS YOU ARE.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; SO YOU'VE GOT THIS, YOU'VE GOT THAT,
[57:11] YOU'VE GOT THIS SEASON, YOU'VE GOT THAT
[57:13] SEASON, BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE OF
[57:15] THE WORLD. YOU'RE LET'S BROTHER BRANDON
[57:17] WOULD SAY WE NEED TO PUT BACK CHRIST
[57:19] INTO THE PICTURE.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; SEE, AND SO SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S JUST
[57:24] AN OVERVIEW. BROTHER BRANDHAM REPEATEDLY
[57:27] TAUGHT UH THAT CHRISTMAS AS COMMONLY
[57:30] CELEBRATED IS IS HEAVILY COMMERCIALIZED
[57:33] AND IT'S ROOTED IN NON-BIBLICAL
[57:35] TRADITIONS. AND HE WASN'T WRONG.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH. HE
[57:39] CRITICIZED, BROTHER BRENNHAM CRITICIZED
[57:41] HEAVILY THE PAGAN COMMERCIAL ASPECTS OF
[57:44] SANTA CLAUS AND ALL OF THESE THINGS, but
[57:47] he DID NOT AT ALL PROHIBIT CHRISTIANS
[57:49] FROM HONORING CHRIST'S BIRTH. INSTEAD,
[57:51] EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW IT WASN'T CHRIST'S
[57:52] BIRTH, BUT INSTEAD HE ENCOURAGED
[57:55] BELIEVERS TO treat Christmas with UH AS
[57:58] A SOLEMN DAY OF WORSHIP AND REFLECTION,
[58:01] KEEPING CHRIST AT THE CENTER. HE NEVER
[58:04] INTRODUCED, brother Brandham never
[58:06] introduced any new prohibitions or
[58:09] emphasis UH EMPHASIS RATHER INSTEAD HE
[58:12] MAINTAINED the tradition of treating the
[58:15] holidays as spiritually SIGNIFICANT BUT
[58:18] NOT NOT CENTRAL TO ANY KIND OF OUTWARD
[58:21] CELEBRATION. THE EMPHASIS FOR BROTHER
[58:23] BRANDHAM WAS ON SPIRITUAL MEANING, ON
[58:26] WORSHIP, ON PERSONAL DEVOTION AND ON
[58:29] OUTWARD UH YOU KNOW ON OUTWARD UH UM NOT
[58:33] NOT ON AN OUTWARD or or ritual
[58:36] prohibition.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT THE QUOTES DON'T SUPPORT
[58:39] THAT. I WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO VOICE OF
[58:42] GOD RECORDINGS WHO HAS A POST ON THEIR
[58:44] ON THE VOICE OF GOD SITE UH YOU KNOW
[58:47] WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT QUOTES WHERE
[58:49] BROTHER BRANDHAM LAYS THAT OUT WHAT I'M
[58:51] SAYING. HE LAYS IT OUT IN VERY CLEAR
[58:53] TERMS and and he you SAY WELL HE RAGED
[58:55] AGAINST THE PENCIL. HE DID. HE RAGED
[58:58] AGAINST THE THE THE PAGAN CELEBRATION OF
[59:00] IT LEAVING CHRIST OUT OF THE PICTURE. HE
[59:02] RAGED AGAINST, YOU KNOW, TURNING THIS
[59:04] INTO WHISKEY PARTIES AND AND DRUNKEN
[59:06] PARTIES AND HE SHOULD AND YOU SHOULD
[59:08] RAIL AGAINST IT AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE
[59:11] IN OUR MINDS. WE SHOULD NOT BE TEACHING
[59:12] OUR CHILDREN ABOUT THOSE THINGS. SEE, SO
[59:16] THE IDEA YOU KNOW UH UH BROTHER BRANDHAM
[59:20] IN THESE IN THESE ITEMS UH IS IS VERY
[59:23] CLEAR. AMEN. NOW I want to I WANT TO AS
[59:26] I'VE SAID TO YOU TODAY, I'm not trying
[59:28] TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO HISTORY. UM AS
[59:32] ME AS MENTIONED EARLIER, I HAVE A VERY
[59:34] DIFFERENT BURDEN ON MY heart for a
[59:36] Christmas message. Uh one that actually
[59:40] um you KNOW CAME UPON me concerning uh
[59:44] THE ACTUAL JOURNEY OF THE THREE WISE MEN
[59:48] WHO CAME FOLLOWING a star to Jesus in
[59:51] the manger. THE IDEA IS THAT THEY
[59:54] DOUBTLESS HAD QUITE A BIT OF PREPARATION
[59:57] FOR SUCH A LENGTHY and difficult journey
[1:00:00] as it was from the east which was likely
[1:00:03] history shows likely a capital city in
[1:00:05] Persia or Babylon. And it was um it uh
[1:00:09] it was a uh it was not a journey of
[1:00:11] days. It was a a journey of many months.
[1:00:14] AND YET BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT YOU
[1:00:16] KNOW FOR YEARS THEY WERE TRAVELING. BUT
[1:00:18] DON'T FORGET THAT THESE WERE WISE MEN.
[1:00:20] THEY DIDN'T JUST GO, "HEY, THERE'S
[1:00:22] THERE'S A SIGN IN THE HEAVENS. LET'S GO
[1:00:23] GET ON OUR CAMELS AND GO." There's
[1:00:25] planning, THERE'S LOGISTICS, THERE'S
[1:00:27] FINANCES, THERE'S RESOURCES, THERE'S
[1:00:29] SUPPLIES, THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S
[1:00:31] LEARNING. WE GOT TO WE GOT TO FIGURE
[1:00:32] THIS OUT. AND SO, AS THEY JOURNEYED, YOU
[1:00:35] KNOW, AS THEY JOURNEYED, uh they surely
[1:00:38] had made UH AND CERTAINLY HAD
[1:00:41] ANTICIPATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT
[1:00:44] THEY WOULD WHAT THEY WOULD HOPE TO
[1:00:46] ACCOMPLISH. THAT'S LIFE.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE DO. WE'RE ON A JOURNEY.
[1:00:50] WE HAVE EXPECTATIONS ALONG THE LIFE
[1:00:52] ALONG THE JOURNEY OF LIFE. AND I'M I'M
[1:00:54] NOT SAYING THEY HAD IT ALL FIGURED OUT.
[1:00:56] AND AND AND I WOULD SAY VERY LIKELY THEY
[1:00:59] HAD TO MAKE SOME, YOU KNOW, MAKE SOME OF
[1:01:01] IT UP AS THEY WENT ALONG TO SAY NOTHING
[1:01:03] OF the seemingly bewilderment of the
[1:01:06] local population when they arrived in
[1:01:09] Jerusalem. AND UH EVEN THE GOVERNMENT UH
[1:01:12] WAS PUZZLED when they when they arrived.
[1:01:14] SO THERE'S A A TON OF HUMAN TEXTURE in
[1:01:16] all of that. and and and and and and
[1:01:19] NEITHER I NOR IS BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:01:21] BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT
[1:01:23] THIS JOURNEY AND THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF
[1:01:24] THE HEART OF MY SERMON TODAY. I'm going
[1:01:26] to read you some snippets from THINGS HE
[1:01:28] SAID. AND I WANT YOU TO REALIZE THAT I'M
[1:01:31] NOT AND NEITHER WAS BROTHER BRANDHAM,
[1:01:33] YOU KNOW, FORCING THE TEXT TO SAY
[1:01:35] SOMETHING THAT'S NOT WRITTEN THERE. BUT
[1:01:37] YOU ALWAYS WANT TO REALIZE THAT THERE'S
[1:01:39] QUITE A BIT OF UH OF WHAT THE TEXT CAN
[1:01:42] QUIETLY ASSUME SOMETIMES BY WHAT IT
[1:01:44] DOESN'T SAY.
[1:01:47] FIRSTLY, I THINK THE FIRST POINT THAT
[1:01:49] STRIKES MY HEART IS THAT THIS WAS NOT A
[1:01:53] SPONTANEOUS JOURNEY.
[1:01:55] They didn't JUST WAKE UP ONE DAY AND
[1:01:57] DECIDE, I NEED TO GO CHECK AND SEE IF I
[1:01:59] CAN FIND A NEW KING. NOBODY WOULD
[1:02:02] UNDERTAKE THAT KIND OF A JOURNEY WITHOUT
[1:02:04] PREPARATION, WITHOUT COMMITMENT, WITHOUT
[1:02:07] CONVICTION. BUT IT'S JUST LIKE IN MY
[1:02:09] MIND WHEN I GO BACK TO ELISHA being uh
[1:02:12] having his THE MANTLE OF ELIJAH LAID
[1:02:14] UPON HIM AND ELISHA IS PLOWING WITH 12
[1:02:18] YOLK OF OXEN SHOWING THAT HIS family was
[1:02:20] a family of means. Uh you DIDN'T
[1:02:22] NORMALLY HAVE 12 TEAM OF OXEN unless
[1:02:24] your family was wealthy. SO I WOULD say
[1:02:27] that the world was Elisha's oyster for
[1:02:29] the taking. He probably had
[1:02:30] opportunities at the finest schools and
[1:02:33] THE FINEST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. HE
[1:02:35] HAD A LOT TO WALK AWAY FROM. AND WHEN
[1:02:38] ELIJAH PUT HIS HAND UPON HIM AND AND PUT
[1:02:40] HIS MANTLE UPON HIM, YOU KNOW, ELIJAH
[1:02:43] ELISHA SAID, "LET ME GO. THIS IS A GREAT
[1:02:45] HONOR. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. AND I KNOW
[1:02:48] WHAT THIS MEANS. WHEN YOU'VE CAST YOUR
[1:02:49] MANTLE UPON ME, LET ME GO AND SAY
[1:02:51] SOMETHING TO MY PARENTS." AND ELIJAH
[1:02:54] TURNS AROUND AND SAYS, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:02:56] WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH THEE? I'M NOT
[1:02:58] INVOLVED IN THIS DECISION. I'VE ONLY
[1:03:00] DONE WHAT THE LORD TOLD ME TO DO. NOW
[1:03:02] YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDE. BUT THINK WELL,
[1:03:05] ELISHA. THINK WELL BECAUSE I'M HATED BY
[1:03:08] THE PUBLIC. I'M HATED BY THE GOVERNMENT.
[1:03:11] THE QUEEN WANTS TO KILL ME. I'M NOT
[1:03:13] POPULAR. THE CHURCHES HAVE THROWN ME ALL
[1:03:16] OUT. YOU BETTER THINK WELL, ELIJAH, CUZ
[1:03:18] YOU'VE GOT YOUR HAND TO A PLOW RIGHT
[1:03:20] NOW. AND YOU'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF
[1:03:22] OPPORTUNITY OUT IN FRONT OF YOU. BUT
[1:03:24] DOWN THE ROAD, THERE'S GOING TO BE A
[1:03:25] HOLY MAN STAND ON THE EARTH AND SAY,
[1:03:28] "WHOEVER PUTS HIS HAND TO THIS PLOW AND
[1:03:30] TAKES IT AWAY, HE HE OH MY, WHAT A
[1:03:34] TRAGEDY. YOU'RE YOU'RE NEVER SUPPOSED TO
[1:03:36] TAKE YOUR HAND AWAY FROM THIS PLOW."
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO IT WAS IT WAS NOT SOMETHING
[1:03:42] WITHOUT CONVICTION OR COMMITMENT. YOU
[1:03:45] KNOW, WHATEVER ELSE WE SAY, THESE MEN
[1:03:47] HAD ALREADY COUNTED THE LOSS BEFORE THEY
[1:03:49] EVER SAW THE CHILD.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And I think that's a lesson for
[1:03:54] us. AND SO THE BURDEN THAT THE LORD HAS
[1:03:56] SPOKE INTO MY HEART OVER LAST WEEKEND
[1:03:59] WAS THAT we too are on a journey to the
[1:04:02] Christ.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; WE BEGAN A SPIRITUAL JOURNEY JUST LIKE
[1:04:07] THEY DID USING THAT USING THAT AS A TYPE
[1:04:10] AND SHADOW. WE BEGAN A JOURNEY. I I
[1:04:12] WASN'T IN IN IN IN PERSIA OR BABYLON AND
[1:04:16] I DIDN'T TRAVEL TO JERUSALEM OR
[1:04:18] BETHLEHEM, BUT I DID BEGIN A JOURNEY
[1:04:20] FROM THE WORLD TO THE WORD. AND I'M
[1:04:23] STILL ON THAT JOURNEY TODAY. AND I WOULD
[1:04:26] SAY TO YOU TODAY, JUST LIKE YOU COULD
[1:04:27] HAVE ASKED THEM, I I'M ASKING YOU TODAY,
[1:04:30] WHAT HAS BEEN OUR EXPERIENCES ALONG THE
[1:04:33] way on this journey from the world TO
[1:04:37] THE WORD? HOW ARE WE HOLDING UP? JUST AS
[1:04:41] THESE THREE WISE MEN, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
[1:04:44] TO FIND WHEN YOU GET THERE?
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; How are you handling your journey at
[1:04:55] this Christmas season? HOW ARE YOU
[1:04:58] HANDLING YOUR JOURNEY with its weariness
[1:05:02] at times? THE OBSTACLES THAT WE
[1:05:05] CONSTANTLY HAVE TO OVERCOME OR LET'S
[1:05:09] JUST BE HONEST THE THE PLAIN SASSIFRASS
[1:05:12] DISAPPOINTMENTS
[1:05:14] THAT POP UP ALONG THIS JOURNEY.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Are you put off?
[1:05:22] ARE YOU DISCOURAGED? ARE YOU PUT OFF OR
[1:05:25] ARE YOU DISCOURAGED WITH THE POLITICAL
[1:05:27] UPHEAVAL THAT YOU SEE? THE DISHONESTY IN
[1:05:31] OUR GOVERNMENT AND IN GOVERNMENTS OF THE
[1:05:32] WORLD AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS. AND AND AND
[1:05:35] WHAT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT ABOUT THE THE
[1:05:38] CONFUSION, THE THEOLOGICAL CONFUSION
[1:05:41] THAT THE WISE MEN ENCOUNTERED AMONG THE
[1:05:43] CLERGY WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND AND
[1:05:46] DISAGREEMENTS AND AND AND AND HOW DO YOU
[1:05:49] FEEL ABOUT THE DISAGREEMENTS AND THE
[1:05:50] PUSH BACK from the world against the
[1:05:52] word that we hold dear? HOW DO YOU HOW
[1:05:55] ARE YOU HANDLING THE CRITICISMS THAT
[1:05:57] COME TO US FROM THE RANKS OF THE MODERN
[1:06:00] CHRISTIAN CHURCH? I WOULD SAY TO YOU
[1:06:01] TODAY LIKE BROTHER BRANDHAM, WHAT THINKY
[1:06:04] OF CHRIST?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU SAY? YOU'RE ON A JOURNEY
[1:06:09] LIKE THEY WERE ON A JOURNEY.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; IS THIS OPEN BOOK THAT HAS COME TO US IN
[1:06:16] THIS DAY? I WANT TO SAY THIS SLOWLY. IS
[1:06:18] THIS OPEN BOOK OF THE WORD THAT HAS BEEN
[1:06:21] RESTORED TO US IN THIS DAY? IS IT A
[1:06:24] LIVING EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST TO YOU? IS
[1:06:28] IT LIVING IN YOUR HEART DAILY? IF NOT,
[1:06:31] THEN YOU HAVEN'T MADE THE JOURNEY YET.
[1:06:33] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, IT'S GOING TO LEAD
[1:06:35] YOU TO A LIVING EXPERIENCE. THIS JOURNEY
[1:06:37] ISN'T ABOUT PASSING TIME OR KEEPING A
[1:06:40] LIST OF DOS AND DON'TS OR BEING JUDGED
[1:06:42] IN HOLY DAYS AND HOLIDAYS AND AND MEATS
[1:06:45] AND DRINK OFFERINGS. NOT ABOUT THAT. I
[1:06:47] WOULD ONLY KNOW THIS THIS OF YOU. DO YOU
[1:06:49] KNOW HIM IN THE LIVING REALITY OF THE
[1:06:51] WORD
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; THAT HE'S brought to us?
[1:06:56] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS IT THIS WAY AND HE
[1:06:58] HE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO TIE Paul's
[1:07:02] um Hebrews 12 12th chapter of Hebrews,
[1:07:05] Paul's lesson THERE ABOUT LAYING ASIDE
[1:07:08] EVERY WEIGHT OF UNBELIEF.
[1:07:10] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS IN COMMUNION 1962,
[1:07:13] "ALMIGHTY GOD, THE FATHER, OUR LORD
[1:07:15] JESUS CHRIST, who raised him up from the
[1:07:16] dead and set him at the right hand of
[1:07:19] the majesty ever living to make
[1:07:21] intercessions
[1:07:24] upon the things that we believe that he
[1:07:26] did for us and confess it to be so."
[1:07:30] I love this. I love the humility of this
[1:07:31] prophet. It It gives me hope. WE PRAY,
[1:07:34] LORD GOD, THAT TONIGHT THAT YOU'LL
[1:07:37] FORGIVE OUR SINS.
[1:07:39] AMEN.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A PROPHET STANDING IN A PULL PIT
[1:07:44] praying this.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; I PRAY LORD THAT YOU'LL FORGIVE OUR
[1:07:47] SINS. HOW MANY WOULD SAY TODAY, I'M ON
[1:07:49] MY JOURNEY. I PRAY YOU FORGIVE MY SINS,
[1:07:51] LORD.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:07:54] OH, WE WANT TO KEEP UNDER THE BLOOD AT
[1:07:57] ALL TIMES FOR WE DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT
[1:08:00] MIGHT HAPPEN. ALL THINGS ARE ABOUT WOUND
[1:08:02] UP. WE FEEL, LORD, THAT THE COMING OF
[1:08:04] THE LORD IS AT HAND. Watch this. and
[1:08:07] we're fixing to take a journey. AND AS
[1:08:10] WE THINK OF A JOURNEY, WE MIGHT THINK OF
[1:08:12] SUITCASES AND EXTRA CLOTHING AND EXTRA
[1:08:15] SHOES. BUT HOW different from this
[1:08:18] journey? IT'S NOT PACKING UP. IT'S
[1:08:20] UNPACKING. LAYING ASIDE, AS YOUR GREAT
[1:08:23] SERVANT PAUL SAID IN THE BOOK OF
[1:08:25] HEBREWS, THE 12TH CHAPTER, WE LAY ASIDE
[1:08:27] EVERY WEIGHT AND THE UNBELIEF THAT DOTH
[1:08:29] SO EASILY BESET US. IT DOES THAT SO
[1:08:33] EASILY. IT DOES THAT SO EASILY.
[1:08:36] YOU DABBLE IN THE WORLD AND LOSE YOUR
[1:08:38] PRAYER LIFE, YOU LOSE YOUR CHURCH
[1:08:40] ATTENDANCE, THE DEVIL WILL SO EASILY
[1:08:43] TAKE YOU DOWN A WORLDLY PATH.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; IT'S A PRIMROSE PATH THAT HAS NOTHING AT
[1:08:50] THE END OF IT BUT DISAPPOINTMENT. IT'S
[1:08:51] ALL BASED ON A LIE.
[1:08:54] [clears throat]
[1:08:55] So he SAYS WE LAY ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT AND
[1:08:58] THAT WE MIGHT RUN WITH PATIENCE THE RACE
[1:09:00] THAT IS SET before us.
[1:09:03] YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T ASSOCIATE THE JOURNEY
[1:09:05] OF THE THE WISE MEN or the suffering
[1:09:10] labor of Mary. And I and I and I I HOPE
[1:09:14] THIS DOESN'T OFFEND YOU. I'm going to
[1:09:16] say it anyway, BUT THERE'S NO WAY. AND
[1:09:18] PLEASE DON'T TRY TO TO SPEAK TO EVER
[1:09:22] SPEAK TO ME IN A WAY THAT SOUNDS LIKE
[1:09:25] YOU'RE ASSOCIATING THE SUFFERING AND THE
[1:09:28] JOURNEY AND THE TRIAL THAT THESE WISE
[1:09:30] MEN WENT THROUGH OR THE LABOR THAT MARY
[1:09:33] WENT THROUGH AND SOMEHOW ASSOCIATE THAT
[1:09:35] TO A MAN IN A FUZZY RED SUIT.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; ALL THE BRIGHT COLORED LIGHTS. WE SHOULD
[1:09:43] NEVER DO THAT. DON'T EVER BE GUILTY OF
[1:09:46] SUCH A THING AS AS HAVING THAT ABOVE
[1:09:49] WHAT THIS SHOULD MEAN IN YOUR LIFE. THIS
[1:09:51] I THIS IS GOD'S GIFT. HE GAVE US CHRIST.
[1:09:53] HE GAVE US THE WORD. HE GAVE US SIGNS
[1:09:55] AND WONDERS. GAVE US PREACHERS.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; SEE?
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; GOD'S NOT SHORT ON GIFT GIVING. BUT HE
[1:10:01] GIVES YOU THE BEST KIND.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; See the THE THE WAY THE WORLD GOES AFTER
[1:10:07] ALL THE FUZZY RED SUITS AND THE BRIGHT
[1:10:09] LIGHTS.
[1:10:10] THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE CHRISTMAS TINSEL
[1:10:12] THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SO CONDEMNED. AND
[1:10:14] I JUST WANT TO SAY TO YOU TODAY,
[1:10:16] FRIENDS, THAT ONCE YOU GO THERE, IT'S
[1:10:18] JUST A SHORT STEP TO REMOVING ALL THE
[1:10:21] SACREDNESS OF the Christmas season.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; AND ONCE YOU GO THERE, IT'S EVEN A
[1:10:26] SHORTER STEP TO REPLACING IT WITH
[1:10:28] DRUNKEN REALRY AND SIN. YOU SAY, "OH,
[1:10:30] I'd never do that." You can't imagine
[1:10:32] how easy that slippery slope, how
[1:10:33] slippery it is
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; once you take away the sacredness of it
[1:10:39] UNTIL YOU FINALLY TURN WHAT SHOULD BE
[1:10:42] PERHAPS THE SECOND MOST SACRED TIME UH
[1:10:44] BEHIND EASTER PERHAPS AND YOU TURN THAT
[1:10:47] INTO A CAULDRON of perversion.
[1:10:50] And that's what the WORLD DOES. THAT'S
[1:10:52] THAT'S NOT IMAGINED. THAT'S NOT
[1:10:54] CONSPIRACY. YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:58] It's not me raining ON A PARADE. I'M I'M
[1:11:01] NOT DOING THAT. I LOVE THE FESTIVE
[1:11:03] HOLIDAY season that it brings. I love
[1:11:05] the children's play that we'll see here
[1:11:07] very shortly. I love the uh brother
[1:11:09] Brandham also. I I I LOVE THE WARM
[1:11:11] FEELINGS OF THAT YOU CAN SEE IT OF
[1:11:13] PUBLIC brotherhood and what's left of
[1:11:16] it. Anyway, and and you know THE WARM
[1:11:18] THINGS THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM HAD TO SAY
[1:11:20] ABOUT a true Christmas. I'm going to
[1:11:22] give you A CHRONOLOGICAL SNIPPET, JUST A
[1:11:24] just a touching of some of the things he
[1:11:26] said. I'd invite you to THE VOICE OF
[1:11:28] GOD'S SITE AND READ ALL OF THOSE QUOTES
[1:11:30] um in depth. BROTHER BRANDHAM MENTIONS

[1:11:35] 1954, WE'RE GOING TO GO CHRONOLOGICALLY.
[1:11:37] 1954 and divine healing. Everybody seems
[1:11:40] to be so friendly around CHRISTMAS TIME,
[1:11:42] WANTING TO help one another. IT'D BE
[1:11:44] GOOD IF IT STAYED CHRISTMAS, WOULDN'T
[1:11:46] IT? JUST CHRISTMAS ALL THE TIME. 1959
[1:11:49] questions and answers. WE WERE RIDING
[1:11:51] LAST NIGHT SHOWING THE KIDDIES ALL THE
[1:11:53] HOUSES DECORATED AND EVERYTHING WHICH IS
[1:11:55] awful nice and he he show HE HE TALKS
[1:11:58] ABOUT SEEING A NEON SIGN THAT SAID
[1:12:00] TRUSTING CHRIST WILL BE IN YOUR
[1:12:03] CHRISTMAS 1960 GOD'S WRAPPED GIFT SEEMS
[1:12:06] LIKE IT HAS A SPECIAL little blessing
[1:12:08] left for us. IT'S TOO BAD WE CAN'T HAVE
[1:12:11] THIS CHRISTMAS FEELING ALL THE TIME.
[1:12:13] People waving at you and saying the Lord
[1:12:15] bless you. THAT'S GOOD. I LIKE THAT
[1:12:16] THING ABOUT CHRISTMAS. We wish you UH
[1:12:19] THE BEST IN THIS uh these ULE TIDINGS IN
[1:12:22] THIS TIME OF FELLOWSHIP AROUND THESE
[1:12:24] holy days. I'm just reading a prophet. I
[1:12:27] I express to each and every one OF YOU
[1:12:29] HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO YOU for your
[1:12:32] Christmas cards and your gifts. HOW
[1:12:34] THANKFUL WE ARE FOR THIS INNER CHRISTIAN
[1:12:37] experience Christmas in our hearts. 1962
[1:12:41] PRESUMING NOT EXACTLY A MERRY CHRISTMAS
[1:12:44] BUT GOD'S BLESSING OF CHRISTMAS be upon
[1:12:47] you 1963 GOD'S GIFTS ALWAYS FIND THEIR
[1:12:51] PLACE WISH EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU A
[1:12:53] VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS MAY THE GREAT
[1:12:55] CHRISTMAS PRESENT Jesus Christ be aresh
[1:12:58] in your heart
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN HOW MANY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT
[1:13:02] HAVE JESUS CHRIST ARESH IN OUR HEART
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; SO YOU KNOW SO I I GET ALL OF THAT I GET
[1:13:09] BROTHER BRANDON
[1:13:11] UH AND AND AND AS I SAID TO YOU IN IN A
[1:13:13] JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORY,
[1:13:15] THAT KIND OF AN ATTITUDE GOES BACK TO
[1:13:17] THE TO THE ISUZA FATHERS. THAT SAME
[1:13:20] ATTITUDE IS IN WESLEY'S WRITINGS. IT'S
[1:13:22] IN LUTHER'S WRITINGS. Uh and and and and
[1:13:25] THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING FROM THE TIME OF
[1:13:27] THE REFORMATION. BEFORE THE REFORMATION,
[1:13:29] CHRISTMAS WASN'T SUCH A THING. Uh but
[1:13:31] even COLUMBUS AND EVEN ST. MARTIN HAD
[1:13:33] NOTHING DEROGATORY TO SAY ABOUT IT. UH
[1:13:36] IN FACT IS YOU KNOW THERE THERE WAS ONE
[1:13:39] UM THEOLOGIAN BACK IN THAT DAY he was a
[1:13:41] contemporary of Martin and uh he he has
[1:13:44] a great uh what he calls a homaly they
[1:13:47] call it a homaly it's just a sermon what
[1:13:48] we call a sermon TODAY ABOUT THESE WISE
[1:13:51] MEN AND AND HOW THEY WHAT THEY WERE
[1:13:53] FOLLOWING IN THE supernatural and and I
[1:13:55] FORGET WHAT HIS NAME WAS I'VE GOT IT
[1:13:57] HERE IN MY NOTES I DON'T WANT TO CHASE
[1:13:58] IT DOWN BUT you know he WAS A
[1:14:00] CONTEMPORARY OF of St. Martin, our third
[1:14:03] messenger. AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAD NO
[1:14:05] INTERACTION, Martin was in tours of
[1:14:06] France and and uh uh um this GUY WAS IN
[1:14:10] WAS IN UH HE WAS THE bishop of of of OF
[1:14:13] CONSTANTINOPLE. AND SO WE FIND THAT THEY
[1:14:16] NEVER REALLY EXCHANGED CORRESPONDENCE.
[1:14:18] AND I THOUGHT IT IRONIC THAT THE HISTORY
[1:14:20] RECORDED THAT THIS MAN UH HE WAS
[1:14:24] CONSIDERED A A VERY ELOQUENT SPEAKER.
[1:14:28] EVERYBODY JUST LOVED THE WAY HE TALKED.
[1:14:29] HE WOULD HOLD PUBLIC SERMONS AND
[1:14:31] THOUSANDS WOULD GATHER AROUND BECAUSE HE
[1:14:33] SPOKE SO ELOQUENTLY. AND THEY SAID THAT
[1:14:36] WHEN THEY WENT AND COMPARED HIM TO M TO
[1:14:39] ST. MARTIN THAT MARTIN MARTIN DIDN'T
[1:14:41] SEEM TO HAVE THAT. BUT WHAT HE DID HAVE
[1:14:43] WAS A LOT OF HUMILITY, A LOT OF
[1:14:45] SPIRITUALITY, AND A LOT OF THE POWER OF
[1:14:47] GOD IN HIS MINISTRY. I'LL TAKE THAT ANY
[1:14:49] DAY
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; OVER ELOQUENT SPEECH. I WANT TO SEE THE
[1:14:53] POWER OF GOD. AS BROTHER MATT WAS SPEAK
[1:14:54] PREACHING THIS MORNING IN OUR SUNDAY
[1:14:56] SCHOOL, I WANT TO SEE THE POWER OF GOD
[1:14:57] IN OUR LIVES, FRIENDS. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; SO I I I UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, THAT UM
[1:15:06] THAT THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM, YOU KNOW,
[1:15:09] HAD THOSE PLEASANT THINGS TO SAY. UM AND
[1:15:12] I GET IT. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT WHAT I'M
[1:15:14] POINTING TO UH AS IT IS IS IS A TRUTH
[1:15:18] THAT ALSO PLAYS OUT IN SOCIETY EVERY NEW
[1:15:22] YEAR. And we see it. WE SEE THE DRUNKEN
[1:15:24] REVALRY PARTIES. UH YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
[1:15:27] HOW MANY FAMOUS PEOPLE DIE AFTER DRUNKEN
[1:15:30] CHRISTMAS PARTIES AND NEVER MAKE IT TO
[1:15:32] THE new year.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; IT'S A SAD CASE. I YOU KNOW THEY WERE I
[1:15:37] I WAS JUST READING SOME COMMENTARY ON
[1:15:40] and and and THE OBITUARY OF SOME OF THEM
[1:15:42] AND THEY TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE OF THE
[1:15:44] comedians and and AND THERE'S A VERY
[1:15:46] FAMOUS COMEDIAN uh by the name of Chris
[1:15:48] Farley and his he he died like THAT FROM
[1:15:50] A DRUG OVERDOSE JUST LIKE BALUSHI ahead
[1:15:52] of him and just like CANDY AHEAD OF HIM
[1:15:54] AND AND and and HIS BROTHER IS TELLING
[1:15:57] THE STORY IN STARK TERMS AND HE HE TALKS
[1:16:00] ABOUT HIS RELAPSE INTO DRUGS AND AND AND
[1:16:03] DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY AND HE WAS
[1:16:04] PARTYING IT UP AND HE SAID HE DIED ON A
[1:16:07] COLD LENOLUM floor alone.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; They found him. HERE WAS A MAN FAMOUS,
[1:16:13] WORLD FAMOUS, MORE MONEY IN THE BANK
[1:16:15] THAN HE COULD SPEND. AND HIS BROTHER
[1:16:17] WRITES OF HIM, "HE DIED ALONE ON A COLD
[1:16:20] lenolium floor in an apartment in
[1:16:22] Chicago. They I found his body days
[1:16:25] later."
[1:16:28] SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE DISPARAGING
[1:16:31] THINGS of the world and HOW THEY
[1:16:32] CELEBRATE IT. BUT BUT IT'S NOT REALLY
[1:16:35] THE EVENT THAT I'M MINISTERING ON TODAY.
[1:16:37] THAT'S REALLY NOT THE BURDEN UH FROM THE
[1:16:40] LORD. I WANT TO FOCUS AS I'VE SAID TO
[1:16:42] YOU, I WANT TO FOCUS ON OUR JOURNEY. OUR
[1:16:45] JOURNEY BECAUSE WE ARE ALSO ON A
[1:16:48] JOURNEY. AND AND THERE ARE THERE ARE
[1:16:50] NONE OF THE STORIES. IN FACT IS I ONLY
[1:16:53] READ ABOUT THE THREE WISE MEN. WHETHER
[1:16:54] YOU READ ABOUT THE SHEPHERDS, THE THREE
[1:16:56] WISE MEN, MARY AND JOSEPH, WHOEVER YOU
[1:16:58] READ ABOUT, IT ALL INVOLVED A JOURNEY.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; You see, AND SO THERE THERE WAS NONE OF
[1:17:03] THESE STORIES THAT ACTUALLY DIDN'T
[1:17:05] INVOLVE A JOURNEY. JOSEPH AND MARY,
[1:17:07] WHICH WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF A FORCED
[1:17:08] JOURNEY BECAUSE OF TAX UH COLLECTION.
[1:17:11] You've got the shepherds, YOU GOT THE
[1:17:12] WISE MEN, AND THEY AND THEY ALL
[1:17:15] [screaming] HAD TO BE willing to
[1:17:18] journey. Yeah,
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; THE JOURNEY OF THE WISE MEN ALONE
[1:17:22] CERTAINLY THE longest of the three- es
[1:17:25] especially if they came from Persia or
[1:17:26] Babylon, you know, a long distance and
[1:17:29] AND YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT LOGISTICAL
[1:17:31] PLANNING. YOU'VE GOT ANIMALS. YOU'VE GOT
[1:17:33] SUPPLIES. YOU'VE GOT MONEY. YOU'VE GOT
[1:17:35] PROTECTION. YOU'VE GOT POLITICAL
[1:17:36] AWARENESS. THEY'VE GOT TO CROSS BORDERS.
[1:17:38] They've got to move through a Roman
[1:17:39] controlled territory. SO, SO IT WASN'T
[1:17:42] JUST ONE DAY THE WISE MEN WOKE UP AND
[1:17:45] SAID, "LET'S JUST GO ON A NICE little
[1:17:47] walk. AMEN.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; THE CHRISTIAN WALK IS NOT JUST A NICE
[1:17:50] LITTLE WALK. WE'RE JOURNEYING TO
[1:17:53] SOMETHING.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE A
[1:17:55] BELIEVER. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN.
[1:17:57] YOU'RE NOT HERE JUST TO COME TO A CHURCH
[1:17:58] AND PAY TITHES AND SING SONGS. AND IT'S
[1:18:01] MORE THAN THAT, FRIENDS. WE'RE WE'RE ON
[1:18:03] A GREAT JOURNEY. AND AS BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:18:05] SAID, IT'S NOT TIME TO PACK ON THE
[1:18:07] THINGS OF THE WORLD. IT'S TIME TO unpack
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; the things of the world.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; NOBODY UNDERTAKES THIS KIND OF A JOURNEY
[1:18:15] WITHOUT some preparation.
[1:18:17] and whatever else we could say. Uh these
[1:18:21] men had certainly counted that cost.
[1:18:23] Brother Brandham
[1:18:25] uh says to US IN A SERMON, EVERLASTING
[1:18:28] LIFE AND HOW TO Receive It, 1954,
[1:18:31] I love this uh uh this this quote. Uh,
[1:18:35] I'm going to read you a quote, but
[1:18:36] throughout the throughout the sermon, he
[1:18:39] starts trying to he he's telling the
[1:18:41] story, and brother Brandham was such a
[1:18:43] great storyteller, and he tells the
[1:18:44] story of these three wise men packing up
[1:18:46] their camels.
[1:18:49] AND HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT,
[1:18:51] YOU KNOW, COME TIME TO GO AND THE the
[1:18:54] wise man NUMBER ONE, YOU KNOW, with his
[1:18:57] frankincense gets on, HE'S READY TO GO.
[1:18:59] The one with HIS GOLD GETS ON, HE'S
[1:19:01] READY TO GO. AND THEN THERE'S THIS THIRD
[1:19:03] GUY AND BROTHER BRANDHAM IS TELLING THIS
[1:19:05] WHOLE SERMON IS ABOUT THIS NARRATIVE.
[1:19:06] IT'S A WONDERFUL SERMON IF you want to
[1:19:08] go listen to it. AND HE HE'S TALKING
[1:19:10] ABOUT HOW THAT WHEN HE GOT ON HIS HIS
[1:19:12] POOR HIS POOR BEAST OF BURDEN. HIS his
[1:19:14] bow legs were bowing. He had TOO MUCH
[1:19:16] JUNK, TOO MUCH STUFF. AND AND AND AND
[1:19:19] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID HE WAS GETTING
[1:19:20] LEFT BEHIND. HIS POOR OLD CAMEL COULDN'T
[1:19:23] COULDN'T KEEP UP AND HE WAS GOING TO GET
[1:19:25] LEFT BEHIND. AND SO BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:19:28] GOES ON A LITTLE BIT. YOU'LL HEAR THE
[1:19:29] NARRATIVE OF IT IN A MINUTE. AND AND AND
[1:19:31] SUDDENLY, YOU KNOW, HIS WIFE'S GOING TO
[1:19:32] HEAR ALL THIS CLAMOR AND SHE LOOKS
[1:19:33] AROUND. WHAT IN THE WORLD, JOHN, are you
[1:19:35] doing? AND I DIDN'T KNOW HIS NAME WAS
[1:19:37] JOHN, BUT WHAT IN THE WORLD, JOHN, ARE
[1:19:38] YOU DOING? AND HE HE WAS AND AND HE SAYS
[1:19:41] SHE HE SAYS THINGS WERE SLINGING LEFT
[1:19:44] AND RIGHT, AND HE WAS UNPACKING.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T PACKING UP TO GO ON A JOURNEY.
[1:19:49] HE WAS UNPACKING TO GO ON a journey.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; See? AND SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID,
[1:19:54] "THEY'RE TRYING TO PACK UP TO BE A
[1:19:56] CHRISTIAN. IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU need
[1:19:58] is to unpack to be a Christian. I COULD
[1:20:01] GO, HE SAYS IN ANOTHER STATEMENT, I
[1:20:03] COULD GO ALONG UNLESS I, YOU KNOW, I
[1:20:05] COULD GO ALONG ON THIS JOURNEY UNLESS I
[1:20:07] UNLESS I TOOK MY CARD TABLE, SEE, AND
[1:20:09] TRY TO HANG MY CARD TABLE on the camel,
[1:20:12] HANG A LITTLE TATTLING on the camel,
[1:20:14] HANG A LITTLE BACKBITING ON THE CAMEL,
[1:20:16] HANG IT ON THE CAMEL. THE OLD CAMEL
[1:20:18] CAN'T HARDLY MOVE, BOW-LEGGED ALMOST. HE
[1:20:20] BEGAN TO THROW TABLES ONE WAY AND
[1:20:22] PACKAGES THE OTHER WAY. AND I'M LAYING
[1:20:24] ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT AND SIN THAT DOES SO
[1:20:26] EASILY BESET me from THIS PARTICULAR
[1:20:29] QUOTE PARAGRAPH 178 EVERLASTING LIFE AND
[1:20:32] HOW TO RECEIVE IT. YOU WANT TO KNOW THE
[1:20:33] ANSWER TO THAT ONE? He says, "I CAN SEE
[1:20:36] THE OTHERS GOING MOVING ON AND THE FIRST
[1:20:38] THING YOU KNOW HE GOT DOWN AND LOOKED AT
[1:20:40] THAT STAR AGAIN." That's what some of us
[1:20:42] need to do, friends.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Take a fresh look at that star.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; FIRST THING YOU KNOW, HE GOT DOWN AND
[1:20:49] LOOKED AT THAT STAR AGAIN. AND SO THE
[1:20:50] FIRST THING HE BEGAN TO THROW TABLES ONE
[1:20:52] WAY AND PACKAGES THE OTHER WAY. THE WIFE
[1:20:55] SAID, "WHERE YOU GOING?" JOHN SAID, "I'M
[1:20:57] LAYING ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT THAT DOTH SO
[1:20:59] EASILY BESET ME, THAT I'VE GOT TO RUN
[1:21:01] THIS RACE WITH PATIENCE, FOR STRAIGHT IS
[1:21:04] THE GATE AND NARROW IS THE WAY AND FEW
[1:21:05] THERE WILL BE THAT FIND IT." THAT'S
[1:21:07] SAYING THAT THERE WILL BE FEW WHO ARE
[1:21:09] WILLING TO UNPACK,
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; FEW WHO ARE WILLING TO GO ON THIS
[1:21:13] [screaming] JOURNEY AND STAY ON THE
[1:21:14] JOURNEY. SEE,
[1:21:17] AND SHE SAID AND AND [screaming] SHE
[1:21:19] SAID, "I CAN HEAR HER SAY OR HE SAYS,
[1:21:21] THERE'LL BE FEW THAT FIND IT. THERE'S
[1:21:23] ONLY ROOM FOR YOU AND JESUS. NOBODY ELSE
[1:21:25] CAN GO THROUGH. JEWISH, JUST YOU AND
[1:21:27] JESUS." AMEN. She said, I COULD HEAR HER
[1:21:30] SAY, "WELL, LOOK, YOU'RE FORGETTING YOUR
[1:21:32] COMPASS. I DON'T NEED ANY COMPASS."
[1:21:34] WELL, YOU'RE FORGETTING YOUR SEMINARY
[1:21:35] DEGREE. YOU'RE FORGETTING YOUR
[1:21:36] BACHELORETTE SERVICES AND ALL THESE
[1:21:38] OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU HANG
[1:21:40] ON. SAID, "LISTEN, I DON'T NEED ANY
[1:21:42] COMPASS. HOW YOU GOING TO GO THEN?" HE
[1:21:44] POINTED UP TO A STAR. HALLELUJAH. HE
[1:21:47] POINTED UP TO A STAR. I'M GOING GOD'S
[1:21:49] PROVIDED WAY. GOD PROVIDED ME A STAR TO
[1:21:53] FOLLOW THAT'LL TAKE ME TO CHRIST.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; SO, THEY WERE FOLLOWING A SIGN THAT IN
[1:22:02] THEIR WORLD ACTUALLY MEANT ROYALTY. THAT
[1:22:04] WAS THE STAR SIGN THAT THEY SAW. I DID A
[1:22:06] BIG DEEP DIVE ON THAT. THEY WERE
[1:22:08] ACTUALLY SEEING A sign that indicated
[1:22:10] royalty was being born in THE EAST. AND
[1:22:13] SO THAT'S GOING TO BEGIN TO SHAPE THEIR
[1:22:15] EXPECTATIONS WHETHER THEY WANTED it to
[1:22:17] or not. I mean, if you're going to see a
[1:22:19] king, you're going to have certain
[1:22:20] expectations.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; They're going to be unavoidable.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; See, if you're IF YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY TO
[1:22:26] HEAVEN, THERE THERE'S SOME THINGS,
[1:22:28] FRIENDS, THAT YOU SHOULD JUST EXPECT.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD EXPECT TRIALS. BUT PETER
[1:22:33] WOULD SAY, EVEN FIERY TRIALS, DON'T
[1:22:35] THINK OF THEM AS A STRANGE THING.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO EXERCISE SOME
[1:22:39] PATIENCE. AND THE APOSTLE WOULD SAY, "SO
[1:22:41] LET PATIENCE HAVE HER WORK."
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; SO WHY WOULD HE SAY YOU SHOULD LET
[1:22:46] PATIENCE HAVE HER WORK IF HE WOULDN'T
[1:22:48] NEED to say that to you? See,
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; SO SO THERE IT WAS GOING TO SHAPE THEIR
[1:22:53] EXPECTATIONS, WHICH WAS CERTAINLY
[1:22:55] UNAVOIDABLE. SO IT'S not a stretch to
[1:22:57] imagine uh that THEY MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED
[1:23:00] A PALACE OR a royal household. WE KNOW
[1:23:03] WHEN THEY GOT BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM,
[1:23:05] HERE'S WHAT HERE'S WHAT I DIDN'T FIND
[1:23:06] AMONG COMMENTATORS that Brother Brandham
[1:23:08] talks about. These were actually Hebrew
[1:23:10] scholars
[1:23:12] and they were in the east studying for
[1:23:14] their degrees. AND SO WHEN THEY SEE A
[1:23:17] SIGN OF ROYALTY TO THEM, IT MEANS ONE
[1:23:19] THING, MESSIAH. IT'S NOT JUST A KING. SO
[1:23:22] NOW THEY'RE COMING BACK TO A NATION
[1:23:25] WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE EXPECTING A
[1:23:27] MESSIAH.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE COMING BACK TO A NATION WHO
[1:23:31] OUGHT TO KNOW PROPHECY. AND SO WHY
[1:23:33] WOULDN'T THEY THEN EXPECT THE ROYAL
[1:23:35] FAMILY IN THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD TO
[1:23:38] RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THAT THAT WHAT
[1:23:40] THEY'RE DOING IS THIS IS AN THAT THEY
[1:23:42] WERE SHOWING UP WAS AN ACT OF PROPHECY
[1:23:45] BEING FULFILLED.
[1:23:47] AND SOMETIMES I WONDER DO WE REALLY SEE
[1:23:50] THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE
[1:23:52] WORLD? DO YOU REALIZE THAT THE MADNESS
[1:23:54] YOU SEE IN THE WORLD IS PROPHECY BEING
[1:23:56] FULFILLED? DO YOU REALIZE THAT A MESSAGE
[1:23:57] HAD TO COME TO PERFECT THE BRIDE IS
[1:23:59] PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED? DO YOU REALIZE
[1:24:01] THAT THERE HAD TO BE EAGLES HERE AND
[1:24:02] EAGLES SCREAM? THAT'S PROPHECY. YOU ARE
[1:24:05] PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; RELIGIOUS LEADERS, YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD
[1:24:12] THINK THAT THAT THAT THAT THE ROYAL
[1:24:14] FAMILY WOULD HAVE SAW THAT. YOU WOULD
[1:24:15] HAVE THINK THAT RELIGIOUS LEADERS WOULD
[1:24:17] HAVE COME TOGETHER AND AND MARSHALED
[1:24:19] AROUND THE WORD TO TO SUPPORT THE
[1:24:21] PROPHECY. INSTEAD, THEY ARRIVE TO
[1:24:25] JERUSALEM AND JERUSALEM IS PUT INTO A
[1:24:28] STATE OF CONFUSION.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; AND BEWILDERMENT. INSTEAD, THE RELIGIOUS
[1:24:33] LEADERS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ALL STARTLED
[1:24:35] AND THEY'RE ASTONISHED AT THEIR
[1:24:36] DOCTRINE. THE ONLY THING HEROD FEELS IS
[1:24:39] THREATENED. THE WHOLE CITY IS TROUBLED.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; SEE, that's important.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE THEIR
[1:24:50] THEIR THEIR obedience unsettled man-made
[1:24:54] systems.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; That's what you're reading. That's I'm
[1:24:59] not I'M NOT STRETCHING THE TEXT. THAT'S
[1:25:01] WHAT YOU'RE READING IN THE SILENCE
[1:25:03] BETWEEN THE lines that YOU'RE READING
[1:25:05] THAT OBEDIENCE TO GOD'S WORD UNSETTLES
[1:25:08] man-made systems. TRUTH ARRIVING SHOULD
[1:25:13] ALWAYS do that.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; TRUTH LIVED THROUGH YOUR LIFE SHOULD
[1:25:20] UNSETTLE MAN-MADE SYSTEMS AROUND YOU.
[1:25:22] AMEN.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THEY'RE CHRISTIANS
[1:25:25] IN A MAN-MADE SYSTEM, YOUR TRUTH, THAT
[1:25:29] YOU'RE LIVING SHOULD UNSETTLE THEM.
[1:25:32] THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A SITUATION WHERE
[1:25:34] WHERE THEY'RE JUST THEY DON'T FEEL
[1:25:36] ANYTHING. THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST CAN GO
[1:25:38] RIGHT ALONG BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE NOT
[1:25:40] EVEN SURE IF IF MAYBE YOU BELIEVE
[1:25:41] EXACTLY WHAT THEY BELIEVE BECAUSE OF
[1:25:43] SOME OF THE WAYS WE we conduct
[1:25:45] ourselves.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; IS THIS OKAY FOR CHRISTMAS?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ON A JOURNEY, FRIENDS. YES. AMEN.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:25:54] EVENTUALLY THEY GOT TO BETHLEHEM.
[1:25:56] THERE'S NO THRONE. THERE'S NO CROWN.
[1:25:57] THERE'S NO POLITICAL welcome committee.
[1:25:58] There's just a child.
[1:26:01] Sometimes on this journey,
[1:26:05] on this journey to the word,
[1:26:08] I want to say to you that sometimes our
[1:26:10] expectations have to be adjusted.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; And when that happens, we don't go to
[1:26:17] the wisdom of this world. We go to God.
[1:26:21] Sometimes our expectations, it don't
[1:26:23] come out like we thought it would. We're
[1:26:25] on a journey. We're trying to do the
[1:26:26] best and we have an expectation when we
[1:26:28] get there. What are you expecting for
[1:26:30] your diligence to the Lord? What are you
[1:26:32] expecting to get out of coming to church
[1:26:34] multiple times a week? What are you
[1:26:36] expecting when you give to the kingdom
[1:26:37] of God? What are you looking for?
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; What's the purpose of YOUR JOURNEY? I
[1:26:42] WANT I WANT YOU TO THINK INTROSPECTIVELY
[1:26:43] TODAY, FRIENDS. That's the real BURDEN
[1:26:45] OF MY HEART. THAT'S WHAT THE LORD ASKED
[1:26:47] ME. THE LORD SAID, "YOU'RE ON A JOURNEY,
[1:26:48] TOO. WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING WHEN YOU GET
[1:26:51] THERE?
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; When I read THE BOOK OF ACTS, I EXPECT
[1:26:55] GOD TO OPERATE IN MY life in power and
[1:26:58] demonstration.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; WHEN I READ ABOUT WHAT THE EARLY CHURCH
[1:27:01] WAS, I EXPECT IT TO BE ON FIRE FOR THE
[1:27:03] HOLY GHOST.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; WHEN I READ ABOUT GOD SENDING A
[1:27:06] MESSENGER IN ANY AGE, I'M LOOKING FOR
[1:27:08] THE UNADULTERATED WORD OF GOD. I'M HERE
[1:27:11] TO TELL YOU, I M I FOUND MY EXPECTATION.
[1:27:14] AMEN.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; LIFE HASN'T ALWAYS TURNED OUT LIKE I
[1:27:18] THOUGHT IT WOULD. BUT REAL REVEALED
[1:27:20] FAITH DOESN'T mean you have every answer
[1:27:23] all the time.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; It means it only means that you
[1:27:29] [clears throat] you keep moving even
[1:27:31] when you don't have the answer.
[1:27:37] One commentator said, "They came, the
[1:27:40] wise men, they came seeking. They left
[1:27:43] worshiping."
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe I could hope that that's
[1:27:50] your journey to this service today. You
[1:27:53] came seeking, you leave worshiping.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:27:59] they weren't the only ones traveling.
[1:28:03] Mary traveled from Nazareth to Judea.
[1:28:05] I'm going to close just in a moment
[1:28:08] to see Elizabeth
[1:28:11] emotionally.
[1:28:13] If you if you read anything at all in
[1:28:16] that story of Mary going to see
[1:28:17] Elizabeth, emotionally,
[1:28:21] spiritually,
[1:28:23] socially, you there was nothing for Mary
[1:28:26] but uncertainty.
[1:28:29] She carried she carried within her a
[1:28:32] promise that at that time she couldn't
[1:28:35] and hadn't and couldn't even fully
[1:28:38] grasp.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Her journey isn't explained to her.
[1:28:43] She's not getting applause
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; on her journey to see Elizabeth.
[1:28:49] IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE LORD SAID
[1:28:52] I'M GOING TO GO SEE ELIZABETH. I'm going
[1:28:53] to make this journey easy for you. THE
[1:28:56] LORD DIDN'T PROMISE HER ANY OF THAT
[1:28:57] THING. JUST SAID GO BECAUSE ELIZABETH
[1:29:00] ALSO WAS WITH CHILD NOW GO SEE HER AND
[1:29:02] MARY UH [screaming] AGAINST ALL
[1:29:03] UNCERTAINTY YOU KNOW WHAT SHE DID YOU
[1:29:05] SAY OH SHE JUMPED THROUGH THE CEILING
[1:29:07] AND HAD ALL KINDS OF POWER AND SPOKE IN
[1:29:08] TONGUES NO SHE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT SHE
[1:29:10] JUST ACCEPTED SHE JUST ACCEPTED WHAT THE
[1:29:13] ANGEL SAID AND STARTED WALKING TO SEE
[1:29:15] ELIZABETH SHE DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE
[1:29:16] ANSWERS FRIENDS SHE SHE DIDN'T SHE
[1:29:18] DIDN'T GET IT AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN GET
[1:29:20] ANY RELIEF UNTIL SHE'S TALKING TO
[1:29:23] ELIZABETH AND WHEN SHE SAYS THE NAME
[1:29:26] JESUS ELIZABETH STARTS REJOICING SAID,
[1:29:28] "WHEN YOU SAID THAT NAME, THE DEAD BABY
[1:29:31] IN MY WOMB JUMPED TO LIFE." I'M HERE TO
[1:29:34] TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. I STILL
[1:29:35] JUMP TO LIFE WHEN I HEAR THE NAME JESUS.
[1:29:38] THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. IT SOUNDED
[1:29:39] LIKE AN EAGLE SCREAM, BUT IT WAS A NAME
[1:29:41] OF CHRIST.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; And it LEAPT IN YOUR HEART AND YOU'VE
[1:29:45] BEEN A LIVING VESSEL EVER SINCE.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD I HEARD THAT NAME ECHO in my
[1:29:51] soul. The real Jesus of the real Bible.
[1:29:56] Joseph and Mary had a journey from
[1:29:57] Nazareth to Bethlehem. That was
[1:29:59] certainly not a convenient reason and
[1:30:01] certainly not a convenient time. We're
[1:30:03] in that season that we think it was. We
[1:30:05] know it wasn't this time of the year,
[1:30:07] but we celebrate the I imagine I don't
[1:30:10] uh I don't remember precisely what all
[1:30:12] the script entails, but uh you know I I
[1:30:14] think it certainly entails the nativity
[1:30:16] and that journey of Joseph and Mary. Uh
[1:30:20] my goodness, you know uh that wasn't an
[1:30:24] easy one either. And I I found it
[1:30:26] interesting in the Bible that Joseph
[1:30:27] never speaks.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; In the whole text. He never utters a
[1:30:33] word. We hear him. We hear a narrative
[1:30:36] of him doing this or that. [snorts]
[1:30:39] But what you find is that he just walks
[1:30:41] along. He leads. He protects. He obeys.
[1:30:46] Another commentator said of Joseph,
[1:30:49] "Sometimes the holiest journeys are
[1:30:52] silent ones." Amen.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; So, it's not about jumping all over the
[1:30:57] building or running all over the
[1:30:58] platform making a lot of noise. It's
[1:31:01] it's sometimes it's just silent
[1:31:04] obedience. One day after another day,
[1:31:07] this Christmas, the previous Christmas,
[1:31:09] from there to here, from here to the
[1:31:11] next one, if there's a next one, I just
[1:31:13] want to be walking steadily in the
[1:31:15] promise of God's word. The shepherds
[1:31:18] didn't plan a journey. [laughter]
[1:31:20] They didn't get up that day planning a
[1:31:22] journey. They got interrupted into one.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; How many How many can RELATE TO THAT? I
[1:31:26] WASN'T PLANNING TO DO THIS. I DIDN'T
[1:31:27] THINK ABOUT THAT AND SUDDENLY I GOT
[1:31:29] interrupted and NOW I'M ON A JOURNEY.
[1:31:31] HOW'D YOU GET ON? HOW'D YOU GET HERE? I
[1:31:32] GOT I'VE BEEN ON A JOURNEY. HOW'D YOU
[1:31:33] GET ON JOURNEY? I DON'T KNOW. ONE DAY I
[1:31:35] WAS GOING THIS WAY IN LIFE AND THE NEXT
[1:31:37] DAY I WOKE UP AND I WAS GOING THIS WAY.
[1:31:39] DO YOU HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS? NO. WHAT
[1:31:41] ARE YOU DOING? I'M JUST WALKING BY
[1:31:42] FAITH.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT NEXT WEEK
[1:31:45] WILL HOLD OR NEXT YEAR OR IF THERE'LL BE
[1:31:46] A NEXT YEAR. I JUST KNOW I'M ON A
[1:31:48] JOURNEY FROM THE WORLD TO THE WORD AND I
[1:31:50] AIN'T STOPPING TILL I GET THERE. AND IT
[1:31:53] DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY EXPECTATIONS GET
[1:31:55] DOWN, HOW MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS, HOW MANY
[1:31:57] OBSTACLES, I'LL JUST KEEP STEPPING OVER
[1:31:58] THEM. I'LL JUST KEEP GOING. I'LL JUST
[1:32:00] KEEP PUTTING ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF
[1:32:01] ANOTHER. I DON'T NEED ALL THE ANSWERS.
[1:32:04] MY FAITH DOESN'T NEED ALL THE ANSWERS.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:32:10] HAD NO SUPPLIES. THINK OF THOSE POOR
[1:32:12] SHEPHERDS.
[1:32:14] NO PREPARATION, NO WARNING AT ALL. BUT I
[1:32:16] I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS FRIENDS. Revelation
[1:32:19] demands movement.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Even if it even if it does interrupt
[1:32:27] your routine,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; even if it interrupts your whole life,
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; revelation demands movement. So where
[1:32:36] are you headed today, friends?
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; As I come to a close,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; where are you headed today? Stand with
[1:32:45] me, brother Mack. Come on and get
[1:32:47] prepared. And [clears throat] musicians,
[1:32:50] uh, make your way.
[1:32:56] Is that a fair question? Where are you
[1:33:00] headed today?
[1:33:03] What does this Christmas mean to you?
[1:33:11] We're at a Christmas
[1:33:13] where we had people with us at the last
[1:33:16] Christmas that aren't at this Christmas.
[1:33:19] And next Christmas,
[1:33:22] some of us may be gone and maybe all of
[1:33:24] us gone.
[1:33:26] Wouldn't that be amazing?
[1:33:29] So, if revelation demands movement and
[1:33:32] no matter what it interrupts in your
[1:33:34] life,
[1:33:35] then where are you headed? And what does
[1:33:37] this Christmas season mean to you?
[1:33:40] I'll have a wonderful time with my
[1:33:43] family
[1:33:45] just like I do every year. One of my
[1:33:48] favorite family times.
[1:33:51] But the thing I can't get off of my mind
[1:33:56] is when I look at a calendar
[1:33:59] and it says December
[1:34:01] 2025.
[1:34:03] What?
[1:34:06] And I see another calendar already that
[1:34:08] says January
[1:34:10] 2026.
[1:34:13] I feel a feeling
[1:34:15] that the time of our great journey to
[1:34:18] the skies is almost here.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; So whatever
[1:34:25] your Christmas plans are this year, God
[1:34:28] bless you. Don't be a part of the world.
[1:34:31] Keep the sacredness in intact.
[1:34:34] Use this time like the messengers
[1:34:36] advised. Use this time to be a witness.
[1:34:40] You'll never get a better opportunity.
[1:34:43] You might not have all the answers,
[1:34:45] friends, but your journey to the sky is
[1:34:47] coming soon. I want to be ready. How
[1:34:52] about you? You want to be ready for
[1:34:55] that? Say, Lord, I'm on a journey today
[1:34:57] and I want to make it to the end. Oh
[1:34:59] God, let's bow our heads. Father, I
[1:35:02] thank you for the delivery of this
[1:35:04] sermon. It unbburdened me, Lord. I feel
[1:35:07] quite finished.
[1:35:09] I feel like you said everything that you
[1:35:11] wanted to say, and I'm grateful to you
[1:35:14] for the things I was able to uncover.
[1:35:18] Lord, I'm thankful for
[1:35:21] these people who have sat here today,
[1:35:23] Lord, gathered on this Christmas
[1:35:25] holiday.
[1:35:26] I hope they're here for more than just
[1:35:29] [music] a children's play.
[1:35:31] They're going to get a big benefit out
[1:35:32] of that. But I hope they're here for
[1:35:35] more than that. I hope you mean more
[1:35:37] than that to them. Lord, if we want to
[1:35:40] see our children raised in the
[1:35:42] admonition of God, if we want to see
[1:35:43] them keeping Christ in this season,
[1:35:47] maybe they need to see the adults
[1:35:48] keeping [music] Christ in the season. I
[1:35:51] pray you'll grant it to us today. Lord,
[1:35:53] we we love you and we thank you for this
[1:35:56] people. Commit the balance of this
[1:35:58] service. Bless our little people as they
[1:36:01] come, Lord, with their little hearts
[1:36:02] shining. They'll children I've I've
[1:36:05] talked to so many adults who were in
[1:36:06] children's plays as little children who
[1:36:08] did nativity plays and things of Easter.
[1:36:11] They never forgot it. It it it it echoed
[1:36:16] through their life all the days, Lord.
[1:36:18] Even as in their elder years, they never
[1:36:20] forgot those times. So, I pray today
[1:36:23] that you will live in their little
[1:36:25] hearts, Lord. and may it be a a lesson
[1:36:28] of humility to us. We commit it to you
[1:36:31] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you.
[1:36:35] Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; I'm nothing.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Sister Joy is transitioning. Go ahead
[1:36:43] and transition, [music] sister.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Unlikely
[1:36:48] [music]
[1:36:49] a place
[1:36:52] for his word to [music] unfold.
[1:36:58] But if [singing] I'll just yield this
[1:37:01] vessel [music]
[1:37:04] and let him have his [singing] way
[1:37:09] from [music] glory unto glory.
[1:37:15] He'll [music] change me day by day.
[1:37:20] Let [singing]
[1:37:21] your
[1:37:23] word
[1:37:25] be born [singing]
[1:37:27] [music]
[1:37:28] in the manger of my heart. [singing]
[1:37:35] Let [music] it live in me. [singing]
[1:37:40] Let it star
[1:37:45] live [singing and music] inside this
[1:37:47] house of clay.
[1:37:52] and mold [singing] it every day.
[1:37:57] Oh, let [music and singing] your word be
[1:38:00] born
[1:38:02] in [music] the manger
[1:38:06] of
[1:38:07] my heart. [singing]
[1:38:12] Let your [music]
[1:38:14] word
[1:38:17] be born [singing]
[1:38:19] in the [music] manger of my heart.
[1:38:26] And [music and singing] let it live in
[1:38:28] me.
[1:38:30] [music] Let it star [singing]
[1:38:35] live [music]
[1:38:37] inside this house of clay.
[1:38:42] Lord, hold it every day.
[1:38:48] Oh, let [music] your word [singing] be
[1:38:51] born
[1:38:53] in the manger.
[1:38:56] As the children prepare, let's just sing
[1:38:58] this together now. Was a tiny simple
[1:39:02] stable. [music]
[1:39:04] It was a [singing] tiny simple stable.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; I'll beaten
[1:39:13] and worn hardly the place. [music] It
[1:39:16] was hardly
[1:39:18] the place for a king [music] for a king
[1:39:23] to be. He didn't choose some place
[1:39:26] special. He didn't choose
[1:39:29] some place special [music]
[1:39:31] to reveal his majesty. To reveal his
[1:39:34] majesty. [singing]
[1:39:37] [music]
[1:39:38] So I know if I give him control,
[1:39:44] he'll [singing] be born in me. [music]
[1:39:50] Let your [singing] word
[1:39:55] be [music] born
[1:39:58] in the [singing] manger of my [music]
[1:40:01] heart. Let it live. Let it live in me.
[1:40:07] [music]
[1:40:08] Let it start.
[1:40:13] [music]
[1:40:14] Live inside this house of clay
[1:40:20] [music]
[1:40:20] and mold it every day.
[1:40:26] Let your [music] word be born
[1:40:31] in the manger
[1:40:33] [singing]
[1:40:34] of
[1:40:36] [music] my heart.
[1:40:40] Outwardly I'm nothing.
[1:40:42] Now outwardly [music]
[1:40:45] I'm nothing.
[1:40:48] Not much [singing]
[1:40:50] to behold.
[1:40:53] [music]
[1:40:54] unlikely
[1:40:56] the place [singing]
[1:40:59] for his word to [music]
[1:41:02] unfold.
[1:41:05] But if I'll just yield my vessel
[1:41:08] [singing]
[1:41:10] and let him have his way
[1:41:15] [music]
[1:41:16] from glory unto glory. [music]
[1:41:21] He'll change me day by day.
[1:41:25] [music and singing]
[1:41:27] Let your word
[1:41:32] be born [music and singing]
[1:41:35] in the manger of my heart.
[1:41:40] [music]
[1:41:41] Let it live in me.
[1:41:46] Let it [music] storm.
[1:41:51] Live [music] inside this house of clay
[1:41:57] and mold [music and singing] it every
[1:42:00] day.
[1:42:03] Let your word be born [music]
[1:42:08] in the manger

[1:42:33] together. Amen. Pull up the words on
[1:42:36] your phone if you want to. Away in a

[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Joy [music] to the [singing] world, the
[1:49:27] Lord is come. Let [music and singing]
[1:49:31] earth receive

[1:51:10] Let's give these kids a kids a great big
[1:51:12] hand clap of welcome.
[1:51:15] [applause] You can be seated.
[1:51:39] Yeah, we can go ahead and dismiss our
[1:51:40] musicians.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Thank y'all for rolling with us.
[1:51:54] Do we have our second to the last row
[1:51:56] cleared? Okay. going to go ahead and um
[1:51:59] can someone tell Sister Joy to bring
[1:52:00] them? I had to run ahead and make sure
[1:52:02] that we were all ready.
[1:52:05] It's a herculean effort,
[1:52:07] but we're happy to do it.
[1:52:57] I will say while we're getting situated
[1:52:59] If anybody can't see fully that's
[1:53:02] sitting on this side, if you'd like to
[1:53:04] move over into the middle or if you if
[1:53:06] you need to move so you can see better,
[1:53:08] now is your chance.
[1:53:11] [snorts]
[1:53:20] Okay.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Actually, can if we can kill this row, I
[1:53:49] can do it. Actually,
[1:53:53] sorry AV team. You're going to hate us.
[1:53:55] The lights's got to go.
[1:54:23] In the city of Bethlehem, there lived a
[1:54:26] potter named Jude.
[1:54:29] He was loved and honored by all who knew
[1:54:32] him. One night, Jude sat alone in his
[1:54:37] humble little shop reading the scrolls
[1:54:40] of the prophet Isaiah. He said to
[1:54:42] himself,
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; "Lord, I have waited for your coming for
[1:54:46] so long. If only I could see you."
[1:54:50] [sighs]
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; I am a foolish man, me, a simple potter
[1:54:54] in this small town making such a request
[1:54:56] for the Lord.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; He blew out his candle and got ready to
[1:55:00] lay down to rest. When he heard a voice,
[1:55:03] call his name.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Jude, my friend, you have asked to see
[1:55:07] me. Tomorrow I shall pass by. If you see
[1:55:10] me and bid me enter, I shall be your
[1:55:12] guest at your table.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Jude did not sleep well that night, and
[1:55:18] before it was dawn, he rose and made
[1:55:20] ready to meet the Lord.
[1:55:23] Eagerly, he looked out, waiting for the
[1:55:26] Lord to arrive. There he saw an old,
[1:55:29] feeble man passing by, looking half
[1:55:32] frozen from the cold. He was blowing on
[1:55:35] his hands to warm them. Jude called out
[1:55:37] to the man.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Come in, my friend, and warm yourself.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; The old man entered his humble shop and
[1:55:43] warmed up by the fire. They had
[1:55:46] something to eat and drink.
[1:55:50] Then the old man was on his way. An hour
[1:55:54] passed and Jude saw a
[1:55:58] His feet were wrapped in rags, limping
[1:56:00] slowly down the street. The potter
[1:56:03] called and invited him in.
[1:56:07] He wrapped his feet in a clean cloth and
[1:56:10] gave the man a sturdy walking stick.
[1:56:30] When the man left, there was new
[1:56:32] strength in his step.
[1:56:36] As evening approached, the potter became
[1:56:39] discouraged.
[1:56:41] Just then, a young woman walked by
[1:56:44] carrying a baby.
[1:57:04] Jude brought her in to share his dinner
[1:57:06] with her. He took a few blankets and
[1:57:09] gave them to the woman to keep her baby
[1:57:11] warm.
[1:57:16] Then he put her on his donkey
[1:57:19] and he took her and the baby to the next
[1:57:22] town.
[1:57:30] It was now late into the evening when he
[1:57:33] returned. Jude was sure that he had
[1:57:36] missed the Lord. He cried out,
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; "Why, Lord, why did you not come? Was I
[1:57:42] so unworthy?"
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Suddenly, out of the silence, Jude again
[1:57:47] heard the gentle voice, sweeter than any
[1:57:49] other.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; "My child, I kept my word. Three times I
[1:57:54] visited you and three times you showed
[1:57:56] your love for me. I was the old man. I
[1:58:00] was the poor I was the cold and
[1:58:03] hungry woman and her baby. You warned me
[1:58:05] at your fire. You bandaged my feet. You
[1:58:08] fed me and clothed me. For it shall be
[1:58:11] said, "Whatsoever you do to the least of
[1:58:13] my brethren, you do it unto me."
[1:58:18] Jude humbly bowed his head, thanking the
[1:58:21] Lord for every person that had passed by
[1:58:23] that day.
[1:58:25] And from that day on, Jude did his best
[1:58:29] to show love to anyone he could. The
[1:58:32] years went by and God blessed his little
[1:58:35] shop. Jude grew his business to include
[1:58:38] a bakery, a woodworking storefront, and
[1:58:42] an inn for weary travelers.
[1:58:51] [applause]
[1:58:56] It was at that time the Roman Emperor
[1:58:58] Augustus decreed that a census should be
[1:59:01] taken throughout the Roman Empire. So
[1:59:03] everyone went to be registered at the
[1:59:06] city of their birth.
[1:59:09] For a quiet little town like Bethlehem,
[1:59:12] this was quite a busy time for Jude.
[1:59:16] As the days went on, he found himself
[1:59:18] exhausted trying to meet the demands of
[1:59:21] the weary travelers.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Hey guys, check out the oatmeal pies.
[1:59:49] The in was full and evening was coming
[1:59:52] to an end. Jude was relieved as he
[1:59:55] approached the quiet of the night.
[2:00:18] It was peaceful.
[2:00:24] He saw a couple of weary travelers
[2:00:27] headed his way.
[2:00:47] My wife and I need a place to stay for
[2:00:51] the evening.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but my in is completely full.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Please, sir, we won't take anything.
[2:01:02] Can't you see my wife is getting ready
[2:01:04] to have a baby?
[2:01:07] I'm very sorry. If I had a room to put
[2:01:09] you in, I would
[2:01:13] wait. I do have something, but it's a
[2:01:17] stable for the animals. Definitely not a
[2:01:19] fitting place for the baby to be born.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; We will take it. And may the Lord bless
[2:01:24] you, for this thing that you're doing it
[2:01:27] is as unto him.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; That was an odd thing to say, thought
[2:01:32] Jude. And he led Joseph and Mary to the
[2:01:34] stable, making them as comfortable as he
[2:01:38] could.
[2:01:47] Nearby there was a hillside where
[2:01:50] shepherds were keeping watch over their
[2:01:52] flocks.
[2:02:00] A bright light shone,
[2:02:03] and the angel of the Lord stood before
[2:02:05] them and said,
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; "Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring
[2:02:11] you good tidings of great joy, which
[2:02:14] will be to you, for there is born to you
[2:02:18] this day in the city of David, a Savior,
[2:02:22] who is Christ the Lord. You will find a
[2:02:25] babe wrapped in swaddling clothes,
[2:02:28] laying in a manger. Glory to God in the
[2:02:31] highest, and on earth peace to good men
[2:02:36] will.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; As the angels were gone away from them
[2:02:40] into heaven, the shepherds went to
[2:02:42] Bethlehem to see that thing which was
[2:02:45] come to pass.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Excuse me, inkeeper. We have been
[2:02:52] searching for the new king. We were told
[2:02:54] Bethlehem is where able to find him.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; A newborn king in this small town. I am
[2:02:59] not sure you will find a newborn king.
[2:03:02] Plus, I am much too busy tending to my
[2:03:04] guests. I even have a poor couple in my
[2:03:06] stable that is getting ready to have a
[2:03:07] baby.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Wait, you said a baby's about to be
[2:03:10] born?
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, in my tiny simple stable.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; That's going to be where we will find
[2:03:15] him. Hurry.
[2:03:18] Jude watched the shepherds rush off
[2:03:20] towards the stable, thinking how unusual
[2:03:23] they were acting. A newborn king in
[2:03:26] Bethlehem. Jude then remembered years
[2:03:28] ago when he was longing for the coming
[2:03:31] of the Messiah and had asked the Lord if
[2:03:33] he could just see him. In the distance,
[2:03:36] Jude heard the sound of a baby's cry.
[2:03:41] [crying]
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Could it really be him?
[2:03:51] Thank you, Lord, for letting me see you
[2:03:52] once again.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Little town [singing] of Bethlehem,
[2:04:32] how still we see these lights.
[2:04:39] Yet in the midst of such serenity,
[2:04:45] I hear a tiny great baby cry.
[2:04:52] in Jews [music and singing] to come
[2:04:55] where the canada sang with prophecies
[2:05:00] about his [music] birth
[2:05:07] of those stained [singing] glass walls.
[2:05:11] Our savior came to earth
[2:05:17] cuz great things of come from silent
[2:05:23] night.
[2:05:28] He chose a [music and singing] quiet
[2:05:31] simple stable
[2:05:34] instead of glitter
[2:05:37] noise [music and singing] and light.
[2:05:41] Lord, help us just to [singing] pull
[2:05:45] away from all the [music] bus
[2:05:50] of life.
[2:05:53] Cuz great things often [singing]
[2:05:56] come from silent night.
[2:06:03] Still waters run deep.
[2:06:09] So I've [music and singing]
[2:06:10] heard it told.
[2:06:16] But in this noise [singing] of
[2:06:19] hurry,
[2:06:21] I see a shallowess
[2:06:24] unfold.
[2:06:27] We need to take the [music] time to
[2:06:30] spend some quiet
[2:06:33] time alone with Christ.
[2:06:38] cuz that's [music] the only [singing]
[2:06:40] way his work can bring forth great
[2:06:44] [music] things of our lives.
[2:06:49] Cuz great things [music]
[2:06:51] of come from silent night.
[2:06:59] [music] He chose a quiet [singing]
[2:07:02] simple stable
[2:07:05] instead of letter.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; noise [singing] and lies.
[2:07:11] Just help us just to [singing] pull away
[2:07:16] [music] from all the bus
[2:07:19] of life.
[2:07:22] Cuz great [music] things [singing] often
[2:07:25] come from silent night.
[2:07:31] Oh, silent
[2:07:34] night.
[2:07:37] Oh holy [singing] night,
[2:07:43] wonderous star
[2:07:47] now led by life.
[2:07:53] They that wait upon the law
