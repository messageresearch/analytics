[37:39] I've always asked you Lord show it to me
[37:41] in your word and I'll believe it forever
[37:44] oh God I I I've not chased great
[37:48] Supernatural signs and wonders I've not
[37:50] chased the excitable things Lord you
[37:53] have done plenty of that in my life and
[37:55] Ministry but it's always been your
[37:56] Sovereign hand
[37:58] but Lord if if even an angel appeared I
[38:00] could doubt the angel if a sign happened
[38:03] I could doubt the sign but your word is
[38:05] sure to me oh God and I love your word
[38:08] and when you show it to me in your word
[38:10] I'm fearless with it Lord I will stand

[38:15] long as I know that I'm standing on your
[38:17] word Lord help us today help us as a
[38:20] people Lord commit ourselves into your
[38:23] hands aresh this trying age this
[38:26] perilous Time Lord the shaking of the
[38:29] world the heavens and you said once more
[38:31] I shake heavens and earth Lord and we
[38:33] are in that time oh God we are in that
[38:36] Harvest Time that Rapture time that
[38:38] latter rain age oh God we have arrived
[38:42] we're here it's now this is now this is
[38:44] happening in real time oh God and I pray
[38:47] that you will sharpen our understanding
[38:50] Quicken our hearts to believe you purge
[38:52] us Lord give us fresh cleansing this
[38:55] morning let nothing hinder the going
[38:58] forth of your word and nothing hinder
[39:01] the receiving of your word granted Lord
[39:03] we commit ourselves into your hands to
[39:05] this end in Jesus name amen God bless
[39:09] you friends as you are
[39:20] seated the voice in the East
[39:25] Wind I want you to uh and brother
[39:30] Mark I by the way not to uh go with the
[39:34] PowerPoint
[39:36] today and uh so we're but we're going to
[39:38] refer to quite a number of scriptures
[39:40] because that's where our faith is is in
[39:43] the word of God
[39:45] so I want you to realize that as we read
[39:51] from our text he hath made the Earth by
[39:55] his power and he hath established the
[39:59] World by his wisdom and he hath
[40:03] stretched out the Heaven by his
[40:05] understanding now this informs my
[40:08] thinking and I trust that it does yours
[40:11] as well that really there is nothing
[40:14] that can come my way that's not under
[40:16] his jurisdiction amen there's nothing
[40:19] you say well well what about judgments
[40:22] he's the one who brings the East Wind of
[40:25] judgment and you're going to find find
[40:27] out here in the Bible that the East Wind
[40:30] is almost always associated with the
[40:34] Judgment hand of God or ominous things
[40:37] that the Lord is doing and so so this so
[40:41] hence my title I almost titled it
[40:43] feeling the East Wind but I decided that
[40:46] it was more poignant to say the voice
[40:49] because I'm referring to the voice of
[40:51] God in the East Wind and I I can't help
[40:55] but look around me in the world today
[40:57] and though I read in the Bible of the
[41:01] very condition that the Earth would be
[41:03] in and it is and the judgments that God
[41:07] promised would accompany it and they do
[41:11] and yet it seems like no one is hearing
[41:13] his voice it seems like the world is
[41:16] just determined to go headlong into the
[41:20] very way and into the very thing and
[41:22] into the very direction that God warned
[41:25] against through millennia through His
[41:27] prophets through his Apostles through
[41:29] his servants through the voice of many
[41:31] Waters I hope today that you have a
[41:35] heart that is ready to hear the word of
[41:37] God and Lord what are your directions
[41:41] for my life what are your instructions
[41:45] to me in every
[41:49] situation I will assure you today that
[41:52] God values his word and fact is the
[41:55] Bible talks about how that he values his
[41:58] word above his
[41:59] name and so and you know sometimes
[42:03] people are a little confused by that
[42:05] statement it's the scripture he values
[42:07] his word he he holds his word in higher
[42:10] esteem than his own name and that
[42:12] doesn't that's not necessarily to say
[42:15] that he holds his name in a lower
[42:17] estimation than his word what it simply
[42:20] means is is that over time God has has
[42:26] um
[42:28] changed or not so much changed but has
[42:31] allowed his name to evolve so he was
[42:36] Elohim but then he comes and and and and
[42:39] even Abraham talks about how that he was
[42:42] Jehovah Gyra and we know that there are
[42:45] seven compound Redemptive names of
[42:48] Jehovah he is Jehovah RFA he the the
[42:52] Lord that Health all thy diseases he is
[42:55] Jehovah Gyra the Lord provid all your
[42:57] needs he is Jehovah savior Jehovah
[43:00] Banner Jehovah buckler he's all of these
[43:03] things to meet every challenge that you
[43:06] could ever face in life from the Cradle
[43:08] to the Grave the Lord has
[43:10] control over
[43:13] everything so his his the understanding
[43:16] of his name has evolved he comes to
[43:18] Moses in the in the book of Exodus and
[43:21] and he says to Moses now you you're
[43:24] going to understand my name Jehovah more
[43:28] clearly Because by the name by my name
[43:32] Jehovah I really wasn't known formerly
[43:35] although Abraham knew and identified him
[43:38] as Jehovah Gyra God is simply meaning
[43:41] that the very essence and the Very
[43:43] meaning behind the name Jehovah whereas
[43:47] Elohim is just the self-existing spirit
[43:50] the all powerful all knowing all seeing
[43:52] God but Jehovah now takes on a further
[43:56] understanding
[43:57] that God is now dwelling with his
[44:00] people so you understand the his name
[44:04] evolves his name ends up in Jesus and
[44:07] God put his name in Christ amen Christ
[44:11] put his name in the church see so the
[44:15] name of God evolves but the one thing
[44:18] that never changes is his word his word
[44:23] is always the same he's a Healer now cuz
[44:26] he was a Healer then he's a savior now
[44:30] he say he became a savior at Calvary he
[44:32] was a savior in Genesis when he slew a
[44:35] lamb and gave Adam and Eve
[44:37] [Music]
[44:40] skins so he he does not change in his
[44:43] word
[44:45] ever so he so th thus he would say he
[44:49] values his word above his name uh it's
[44:52] not that one is more valuable than the
[44:54] other it's just the way that he attribut
[44:57] Utes in the way he goes about revealing
[44:59] it so the B the bottom line comes down
[45:02] to this is that whether it's his name
[45:07] he's uttering or whether it's his word
[45:11] that he's uttering you have to
[45:13] understand that when he utters his voice
[45:16] things
[45:18] move things
[45:20] happen God said let there be light and
[45:24] there
[45:25] was there was no way for it to not be
[45:29] because and no one could block that
[45:31] because God believed his own word God
[45:33] has said at the end time and that the
[45:35] world would go completely insane and it
[45:37] has and he said I'll perfect a bride
[45:40] right under Satan's nose and he is and
[45:43] I'll take a chased virgin home in a
[45:44] Rapture and he
[45:47] shall he said there will be people who
[45:49] disbelieve my word there are he said
[45:51] there will be people who believe my word
[45:53] and there are and I'm them are you them
[45:56] amen
[45:59] if you're believing his word then you're
[46:02] on the right
[46:04] path so we find that when he utters his
[46:08] voice there's effect on the waters
[46:11] there's effect on even the
[46:14] vapors he where we read in our text and
[46:17] and don't don't republish it Mark we're
[46:19] going to hit Psalms 29 and a
[46:21] moment but we find that his voice moves
[46:25] the waters not just Waters but a
[46:27] multitude of waters and even he causeth
[46:30] the vapors to ascend from the ends of
[46:34] the Earth and and and to to ascend from
[46:38] the ends of the Earth so nature obeys
[46:40] him to and
[46:42] from coming and
[46:45] going he maketh lightning say lightning
[46:49] is scary he maketh
[46:51] it he maketh lightning and
[46:54] rain and rain can be to your good or to
[46:59] your harm if it's too
[47:01] much he brings forth the wind and the
[47:04] wind we know the wind can be destructive
[47:07] we we live with hurricanes along the
[47:09] Eastern Seaboard We There are areas of
[47:12] the Midwest who live with sudden
[47:13] tornadoes they're you know they have
[47:16] this thing in nature and this thing in
[47:17] nature and and and this kind of bomb
[47:21] development that they call it but but he
[47:24] refers to the wind as coming out of his
[47:30] treasures so you wouldn't normally
[47:32] associate something out of God's
[47:34] treasure with something
[47:36] bad but but you have to understand that
[47:40] when God is bringing forth his wind and
[47:44] very typically in the Bible more often
[47:46] than not nine out of 10 times at least
[47:48] on average the East Wind pends
[47:53] judgment
[47:54] Calamity penalty
[47:59] he has a North Wind a south wind and a
[48:01] West Wind and they have totally
[48:02] different meanings in fact is completely
[48:04] different meanings we're going to look
[48:06] at that
[48:08] briefly Psalms 29
[48:13] 1-1 give unto the Lord oh ye Mighty give
[48:18] unto the Lord
[48:20] glory and
[48:25] strength give unto the Lord thy Glory
[48:29] due unto his
[48:32] name Worship the Lord in the beauty of
[48:36] Holiness that's quite there's no
[48:39] ambiguity there I mean this is just
[48:41] straight
[48:42] language you know give unto the Lord the
[48:45] glory do his name now that's not just
[48:49] coming into a building and raising our
[48:51] hands which anybody can do that but when
[48:55] it Satan can imp inate people raising
[48:58] their hands and crying real tears and
[49:00] actually move people by emotions but
[49:03] when but what he cannot impersonate is
[49:05] that life that life that comes into your
[49:08] Fallen life and turns you into a new
[49:10] creation in Christ
[49:12] Jesus and so the the order is that we
[49:17] give unto him the worship that we
[49:21] worship him we give him the glory that
[49:24] his name deserves you you I'm here to
[49:28] tell you that your life lived in glory
[49:33] to him is is your re is your
[49:38] requirement it's a it's do you right and
[49:43] you you should never want to live your
[49:45] life in a way that does the opposite of
[49:48] that you ought to let your life glorify
[49:52] him all the
[49:54] time not only in our actions proactively
[49:59] but in our reactions which are more
[50:01] often than not what gets us into trouble
[50:04] amen but but our but and that's why the
[50:07] Bible says that when you can't when you
[50:09] when it deals with your reactions and it
[50:12] talks about a man who can't control his
[50:15] Spirit that's a very bad thing because
[50:18] Solomon attributed that to an unwalled
[50:20] undefended City that the enemy can just
[50:23] come in and plunder because you have no
[50:25] defenses you're you're out of control
[50:29] and I'm here to tell you that the word
[50:30] of God puts you under control it
[50:33] controls your mind it controls your
[50:35] where you go it controls what you do
[50:38] what you say what you think how you
[50:40] react how you
[50:42] respond the testimony that your
[50:45] life the voice of your testimony that
[50:48] people hear not talking about what comes
[50:51] out of your lips talking about what
[50:52] comes out of your life your your life is
[50:54] a
[50:55] voice
[50:57] so he says in verse three of Psalms 29
[50:59] the voice of the Lord is upon the
[51:02] waters so so we found out again that
[51:05] he's controlling the waters we found out
[51:08] he controls Vapors and lightning and
[51:10] rain and wind now also verse three the
[51:13] glory of the god of Glory thundethunder1
[51:27] the voice of the lord breth The Cedars
[51:29] yay the Lord Break The Cedars of Lebanon
[51:31] he maketh them also to skip like a calf
[51:34] I mean he can do either
[51:36] one Lebanon and serion like a young
[51:39] unicorn verse seven the voice of the
[51:41] Lord catch it now here's some more of
[51:43] his control the voice of the Lord
[51:45] divideth the flames of
[51:47] fire I like see you try
[51:50] that the voice of the Lord divideth the
[51:54] flames of
[51:55] fire the voice of the Lord shaketh the
[51:59] Wilderness the Lord shaketh the
[52:01] Wilderness of cadesh so it's not just
[52:04] your local life it's your distant life
[52:07] it's your everything it's your coming
[52:09] and going it's whatever is part of your
[52:12] life the Lord has power to control it to
[52:15] shake it or to get he can send an East
[52:18] Wind or he can send an North Wind or a
[52:21] West Wind or a south
[52:24] wind verse n
[52:28] the voice of the Lord maketh the Hinds
[52:30] to calf and discover the forest and in
[52:33] his Temple doth everyone speak of his
[52:36] glory the lord look at this 10th verse
[52:39] the Lord sth upon the flood yay the Lord
[52:43] sth king forever so I want you to notice
[52:47] he's not
[52:49] standing he's he he sth so he's
[52:53] undisturbed in his authority he's un
[52:56] challenged in his authority sitting is
[52:59] not a defensive
[53:01] position but he's not in a defensive
[53:04] position because he's not threatened by
[53:09] anything I'm so
[53:11] glad that he sth
[53:14] undisturbed ruling over my life he's
[53:18] unthreatened by
[53:22] anything thank you indeed verse 11 the
[53:26] Lord Lord will give strength unto his
[53:28] people can you say Amen the Lord will
[53:31] bless his people with peace can you say
[53:36] Amen we find thank you brother Mark we
[53:39] find uh and and I I I may have you put
[53:42] some others up but wait till I ask you
[53:44] so that we don't it I don't get slowed
[53:48] down we find in the book of Exodus when
[53:52] Israel was being released from their 430
[53:56] years of bondage now the Lord had said
[53:59] they would be in bondage it didn't take
[54:01] God off catch him off guard at all the
[54:04] people were bewildered by their life but
[54:06] God had told Abraham your people shall
[54:08] sojourn in a land 400 years and they'll
[54:11] be evily mistreated but the Lord out by
[54:14] a mighty hand so everything that when
[54:17] Moses came when a prophet came to the
[54:19] people and pointed to the word the true
[54:22] Israelites said amen here's our Prophet
[54:25] reveal the word let's follow him here to
[54:28] tell you today God done the same thing
[54:30] he's doing the same thing today I'm
[54:32] ready to follow our deliverer out of
[54:34] Egypt and a Third
[54:38] Exodus we find that Moses let's put this
[54:43] one up brother Mark Exodus
[54:45] 10:13 I might get a few of these and
[54:48] before we start not putting them up
[54:50] Exodus
[54:52] 10:13 and Moses stretched forth his rod
[54:56] over the land of
[54:58] Egypt
[55:00] now just leave that there for a moment
[55:04] remember that this Rod had just started
[55:09] out naturally it's a rod Moses found and
[55:11] had been a tool in his hand he'd used it
[55:13] for years it was the rod of Moses Moses
[55:16] found it Moses crafted it Moses got it
[55:19] however he got it it's it's a it's not
[55:21] even relevant the the the bottom line is
[55:23] it was just his rod and so it was let me
[55:26] say it like this it was just in his life
[55:29] naturally but when God called him God
[55:32] took ownership of that rod and the Bible
[55:36] says then it became then it was called
[55:38] the rod of
[55:40] God because God took ownership God you
[55:43] were just going through life you were
[55:45] you were born with what you were born
[55:46] with you had this tendency and that
[55:48] tendency you were just living your life
[55:50] but a voice called you aside and God
[55:53] looked down into your life and said now
[55:55] I'm taking that part of your life and
[55:56] it's going to be
[55:57] mine and I'm going to use that part in
[56:00] you to deliver my
[56:05] people so he and Moses stretched forth
[56:08] his Rod over the land of Egypt and the
[56:10] Lord brought an East Wind here it
[56:13] is the Lord brought an East Wind upon
[56:16] the land all that day and all that night
[56:19] and when it was
[56:22] morning the East Wind brought the
[56:25] Locust
[56:31] now we had we read in our text so don't
[56:35] go back to it brother Mark we've read it
[56:37] already we read in our opening text of
[56:39] Jeremiah that when he utth his voice
[56:43] there's a multitude of waters in Heavens
[56:44] and he causeth the vapors to ascend to
[56:46] the ends of the Earth he maketh
[56:47] Lightnings with rain and bringeth forth
[56:49] the wind out of his treasure so so we
[56:51] found out in from our text that when he
[56:55] speaks even even lightning obeys him
[56:57] even rain obeys him and he and they
[57:01] bring for and he and wind we found out
[57:03] that wind obeys him and they bring forth
[57:07] his glory now let's take this one
[57:09] brother Mark Matthew chapter 8 verse 23
[57:14] and we'll catch 23 through
[57:19] 27 Matthew
[57:23] 8:23 and when he this is Jesus Jesus was
[57:27] entered into a ship his disciples
[57:30] followed him that was a good
[57:33] start that's a good start wherever the
[57:36] Lord goes just follow
[57:38] him and behold there arose a great
[57:42] Tempest in the sea now that's surprising
[57:44] you wouldn't imagine that the Lord would
[57:46] lead you into a great Tempest but he
[57:50] did and then he conked out and left them
[57:53] on their
[57:55] own
[57:56] Lord if this is a joke it ain't
[57:59] funny and behold there arose a great
[58:02] Tempest in the sea in so much that the
[58:05] ship was covered with the waves but he
[58:07] was
[58:08] asleep and his disciples now watch his
[58:11] disciples came to him and awoke him
[58:13] saying Lord save us we perish you ever
[58:16] felt like that you ever just said Lord
[58:19] save me I'm
[58:23] perishing and he saith unto them why are
[58:26] you
[58:27] fearful oh ye of little faith oh what
[58:31] you you don't read ahead of me you think
[58:33] I can't save you you think just because
[58:36] the winds and the waves are swamping
[58:38] your boat and you're going to drown for
[58:39] sure what's the odds of us drowning
[58:41] about
[58:44] 100% so the Lord is saying you're pretty
[58:47] much facing 100% Calamity why are you
[58:53] afraid
[58:55] wow and he said unto them why are you
[58:57] fearful oh ye have little faith then he
[59:00] arose and rebuked the winds and the Sea
[59:04] and there was a great calm but the men
[59:06] marveled saying what manner of man is
[59:10] this that even the winds and the Sea
[59:13] obey
[59:14] him from the Bible in basic English
[59:17] translation that 27th verse reads like
[59:20] this and the men were were full of
[59:22] wonder saying what sort of man is this
[59:26] that even the winds in the sea do his
[59:29] orders my goodness we've been following
[59:33] this person around and sure we believed
[59:35] he was Messiah but I never imagined that
[59:39] as a man that the winds and the Sea
[59:41] actually obey his orders whatever he
[59:44] says all nature does that all nature
[59:48] moves I'm so glad because it moves my
[59:50] nature it moves your nature why are you
[59:53] afraid where's your faith call on the
[59:56] Lord all you need is his voice to rebuke
[59:59] the winds and rebuke the waves and I
[1:00:01] promise you peace will come it might not
[1:00:05] be peace like you'd design it but I can
[1:00:08] tell you this whatever is remaining in
[1:00:10] your life when you call on the Lord and
[1:00:12] believe him with all your heart whatever
[1:00:14] is remaining there in your life he is
[1:00:18] under complete control it obeys his
[1:00:22] orders I want you to take comfort in
[1:00:25] that today friends that no matter what
[1:00:28] we might be facing in this
[1:00:31] life when the voice when you call on the
[1:00:34] Lord out of a true heart out of a pure
[1:00:37] heart and you call upon the Lord he'll
[1:00:40] respond he will respond I I don't know
[1:00:43] what you might have to go through you
[1:00:45] know it just seems like a hop and a skip
[1:00:47] for them the storm is here they call on
[1:00:48] the Lord he wakes up rebukes it we're
[1:00:50] done but I'm quite sure that it took
[1:00:53] longer than the three or 4 seconds it
[1:00:55] took me to say
[1:00:56] it I'm quite sure that there was a lot
[1:00:58] of Tempest and tossing and fear and
[1:01:01] threaten and Calamity and and people's
[1:01:03] minds were Imagining the worst cuz
[1:01:05] they're people and that's what we do but
[1:01:08] I'm here to tell you and the Lord just
[1:01:09] seemed like he was asleep and he was but
[1:01:12] that's why brother bam said he's in your
[1:01:14] boat today he's in your boat just wake
[1:01:17] him up why why are you troubled why do
[1:01:19] you let the devil drive you to Madness
[1:01:22] just wake him up wake him up in your
[1:01:25] boat today say Lord Lord save me help
[1:01:29] me you'll be just as astonished as they
[1:01:35] were he had said to we won't bother
[1:01:38] turning to this one
[1:01:42] but God had said to Moses because Moses
[1:01:46] had his human fears and apprehensions
[1:01:50] Lord you know what if the people won't
[1:01:52] believe me and they're going to ask me
[1:01:54] who what is his name who what are you
[1:01:56] talking about somebody sent you who sent
[1:01:58] you God sent me okay what's his name say
[1:02:01] unto them I am that I am and and and
[1:02:05] that's a different I don't want to go
[1:02:06] down that Rabbit Trail but uh but but he
[1:02:10] but he but now comes the question the
[1:02:12] king of Egypt he won't hear me this
[1:02:14] Pharaoh he won't hear me and the Lord
[1:02:16] says to him and you can make a note of
[1:02:19] it and read it at home Exodus 4:8 and it
[1:02:21] shall come to pass the Lord saying that
[1:02:24] if they will not believe thee neither
[1:02:25] hearken to the voice of the first sign
[1:02:28] they will believe the voice of the
[1:02:30] latter
[1:02:31] sign so I I read that so that you
[1:02:34] understand you get my title The Voice in
[1:02:36] the East Wind there's a voice in the
[1:02:38] sign a prophet took that very to topic
[1:02:42] the voice that's in the sign you know
[1:02:45] the voice of God in these last days and
[1:02:47] and and and and a sign overlooked and
[1:02:50] all kinds of different titles that a
[1:02:52] prophet took but but we realize you
[1:02:54] remember that even and this is unrelated
[1:02:56] direct not directly related but just as
[1:02:58] an example when God came to Cain and he
[1:03:02] says what have you done where's thy
[1:03:04] brother he said you know well what why
[1:03:06] are you asking me my My Brother's Keeper
[1:03:08] I don't keep up with him you know and
[1:03:10] the Lord said well then then why they
[1:03:12] explain this and and see if you can get
[1:03:14] out of this one why do I hear the voice
[1:03:17] of his blood crying to me from the
[1:03:19] ground see now Cain knew he's busted now
[1:03:22] there's no way to get out of it because
[1:03:24] now God knows what's happened
[1:03:26] the the voice of thy brother's blood
[1:03:29] crith out to
[1:03:30] me so so he's saying here that if they
[1:03:34] won't believe the voice of the first
[1:03:36] sign so they'll believe the voice of a
[1:03:39] second sign so God sends signs into your
[1:03:43] life please hear the
[1:03:46] voice please hear the
[1:03:49] voice for you could say for God's sake
[1:03:52] for your sake hear the voice because he
[1:03:56] doesn't speak willy-nilly he doesn't
[1:03:58] just issue out his words for no reason
[1:04:01] God values his word above his name it's
[1:04:04] valuable to him he Treasures it he
[1:04:06] guards it he watches it and if he's
[1:04:08] speaking to your life today for goodness
[1:04:11] sake hear the
[1:04:13] voice don't just think oh it's just I
[1:04:16] can just keep going and God keeps
[1:04:17] warning me and I can just keep going and
[1:04:20] God keeps warning me he won't just keep
[1:04:22] warning you there's a voice in the sign
[1:04:26] that he's trying to get your
[1:04:31] attention it's interesting that Pharaoh
[1:04:34] did not hear the voice in these
[1:04:37] signs and Moses is now going to bring
[1:04:41] forth this plague it was actually the
[1:04:42] eighth of
[1:04:44] 10 and and there was going to be an East
[1:04:47] Wind that blew all night a hot East Wind
[1:04:50] and on the hot East
[1:04:53] Wind we find that locusts were being
[1:04:59] carried as judgment to Egypt now just
[1:05:02] for contrast then when it was time to
[1:05:04] get rid of them God used a West Wind
[1:05:07] because a west wind is associated with
[1:05:09] deliverance and God used a West Wind to
[1:05:12] throw them out into the Red Sea and
[1:05:14] Destroy them see so so just have that in
[1:05:18] your
[1:05:19] mind seven
[1:05:21] plagues had hit
[1:05:24] perfectly already
[1:05:26] ready it's incredible when you read the
[1:05:29] book of Exodus and you have the first
[1:05:31] plague and the second plague and I mean
[1:05:34] it just the Lord just starts bombing
[1:05:36] them just bombing them he's turning all
[1:05:39] of their rivers and all their streams
[1:05:41] into blood and the fish are dying and
[1:05:43] the land is stinking he brings frogs up
[1:05:46] he brings lice up he brings flies and
[1:05:49] we're talking about pandemic level lice
[1:05:52] frogs and
[1:05:53] flies we're talking about this is not
[1:05:56] just something and his magicians had no
[1:05:58] answer for this he he brings you know he
[1:06:01] he brings this disease and that disease
[1:06:03] and and he one two 3 4 five six seven
[1:06:07] you would think that when Moses comes to
[1:06:10] him again and says now you've had
[1:06:13] seven king of Egypt seven is God's
[1:06:16] number of completion now let his people
[1:06:22] go and the King
[1:06:24] says I ain't doing
[1:06:26] it seven plagues had hit perfectly
[1:06:30] already and each sign that came bore a
[1:06:36] voice within that sign within that
[1:06:40] warning within that judgment there was a
[1:06:44] voice of God Pharaoh could not escape
[1:06:48] the Judgment of God because he was now
[1:06:52] under a mandate of authority by God and
[1:06:56] there was no way to get out of it and no
[1:06:59] one could get him out of it there was no
[1:07:02] higher court that could he could appeal
[1:07:04] to there was no United Nations there was
[1:07:06] no standing army there was nothing he
[1:07:09] could do even Moses couldn't help him
[1:07:12] because he was under a mandate by the
[1:07:15] word of God from a prophet and you and
[1:07:18] I'll promise you no real servant of God
[1:07:21] likes seeing Humanity suffer no servant
[1:07:24] of the Lord does my goodness they
[1:07:26] dedicate their whole life to the service
[1:07:28] of humanity no servant wants to see
[1:07:31] God's family suffer no servant wants to
[1:07:33] see anybody suffer even God doesn't take
[1:07:36] pleasure in the death of Sinners the
[1:07:39] ones who abuse him and betray him and
[1:07:41] curse him and and reject him and mock
[1:07:44] him and he doesn't even take pleasure
[1:07:46] when they destroy themselves Pharaoh was
[1:07:49] under a mandate of the word and until he
[1:07:52] obeyed it until he heard the voice and
[1:07:55] obeyed The Voice there was no escaping
[1:07:58] the judgments that were going to fall
[1:08:00] upon him and were actively falling upon
[1:08:03] him and seven had already hit perfectly
[1:08:06] and all seven each sign bore a voice
[1:08:09] within it how is it that Pharaoh how is
[1:08:13] it when the East Wind began to
[1:08:17] blow and you'd notice it because it was
[1:08:21] hot how is it that when the East Wind
[1:08:24] begin to blow Pharaoh didn't hear the
[1:08:26] voice in the East
[1:08:33] Wind how is it that you
[1:08:37] don't when you know the Lord In fairness
[1:08:42] and
[1:08:44] injustice
[1:08:46] Injustice and fairness and equity and
[1:08:50] mercy he's warning
[1:08:53] you the East Wind was a warning warning
[1:08:56] Moses had already declared you better
[1:08:59] let them go you better repent Pharaoh
[1:09:04] that doesn't mean get down at an altar
[1:09:05] like we would commonly think that means
[1:09:07] the real meaning of repentance stop turn
[1:09:09] around go the other
[1:09:11] way I'm here to tell you something
[1:09:13] friends sometimes as Believers we need
[1:09:15] to stop turn around go the other way
[1:09:18] Hallelujah because a there's a voice in
[1:09:20] the East Wind and it's clear in God's
[1:09:23] word do this and this is what happen
[1:09:27] amen so how is it that Pharaoh after
[1:09:30] after seeing God so prove his word seven
[1:09:34] times how is it that he in seeing that
[1:09:37] didn't hear the voice in the East Wind
[1:09:39] how is it that that we don't that that
[1:09:42] we don't hear the voice of the Lord when
[1:09:45] he's trying to warn us there's things in
[1:09:47] our in our lives and and God warns us to
[1:09:51] you need to get rid of that you need to
[1:09:53] deal with that you need to lay that side
[1:09:55] you need to walk away you need to
[1:09:57] separate that acquaintance you need to
[1:10:00] move from that friendship you need to
[1:10:02] change this or change that I'm here to
[1:10:04] tell you there's a voice in that warning
[1:10:07] the minister behind the pull pit begins
[1:10:09] to warn he begins to discern your life
[1:10:11] he don't know a thing about you he knows
[1:10:13] nothing of your secrets in your heart
[1:10:15] but you've sit there and we're a witness
[1:10:17] to it I've sit there and I've heard
[1:10:19] Ministry across this pulpit and the Lord
[1:10:21] warning me you better deal with this and
[1:10:23] I say yes Lord I'm going to deal with it
[1:10:26] not tomorrow
[1:10:28] today
[1:10:30] hallelujah how is it that we don't hear
[1:10:36] it how is it that the world doesn't hear
[1:10:38] the voice and the judgments that are
[1:10:41] falling and the madness that we see on
[1:10:43] the streets today it's not that as it's
[1:10:45] not as if it wasn't
[1:10:47] foretold and
[1:10:49] prophesied and a prophet told them you
[1:10:52] know 60 years ago the world will go
[1:10:54] completely ins
[1:10:59] say for one
[1:11:03] thing an East
[1:11:05] Wind seemed normal to
[1:11:09] Pharaoh it would have seemed perfectly
[1:11:11] normal in fact I did a little bit of
[1:11:14] climate research on the East winds that
[1:11:16] blow in from the Arabian Desert acrossed
[1:11:21] Egypt an East Wind and here's the
[1:11:24] results of my research an East wind
[1:11:27] blowing into Egypt from the Red Sea
[1:11:30] would tend to raise the temperature in
[1:11:33] Egypt in fact is they have an I can't
[1:11:35] pronounce it's an Egyptian word it's
[1:11:38] something like kamasan or something like
[1:11:40] that Hamas winds like the hosan that
[1:11:42] come from the East can cause
[1:11:44] temperatures to soar to Dangerously high
[1:11:47] levels often over 113 Fahrenheit with
[1:11:51] relative humidity dropping below 5% so
[1:11:54] you're in an oven
[1:11:56] you're in a hot dry Blast
[1:12:00] Furnace these winds can lead to sudden
[1:12:03] heat waves and are responsible for some
[1:12:05] of the highest temperature records in
[1:12:07] Egypt in fact now this is what
[1:12:10] astonished me the the hot East Wind in
[1:12:14] Egypt these kamasan winds or whatever
[1:12:17] that name is actually occur between late
[1:12:21] March through the end of May or
[1:12:24] sometimes there are little delay and
[1:12:25] they don't start till April and they run
[1:12:27] through June now when Moses is dealing
[1:12:31] with the
[1:12:33] Exodus they're sacrificing a pascal lamb
[1:12:37] in abib or Nissen on the Hebrew calendar
[1:12:41] you know when that is it's Easter it's
[1:12:45] Easter time it's it's like late March
[1:12:47] early April sometimes well into April so
[1:12:52] it it didn't occur to pharaoh to be
[1:12:54] afraid of the East Wind he didn't when
[1:12:57] Pharaoh felt the East Wind he was like
[1:12:59] yeah it's right on time oh Moses nah you
[1:13:02] you dumb Prophet this ain't got nothing
[1:13:04] to do with you this is
[1:13:06] normal what we see in society nah come
[1:13:09] on don't give me all that Jesus stuff
[1:13:12] this is
[1:13:13] normal oh it has nothing to do with the
[1:13:16] comic books and the TV shows in
[1:13:18] Hollywood what a bunch of hoie that's
[1:13:20] nonsense you you cultist weirdo people
[1:13:24] this is just normal this is just
[1:13:25] Evolution this is just mankind we're
[1:13:28] going to be here for thousands of years
[1:13:30] the earth will be I will be you will be
[1:13:34] they won't be because heavens and earth
[1:13:37] are going to pass
[1:13:38] away Hallelujah friends and and what
[1:13:41] might seem normal to the world they know
[1:13:43] it's crazy and kooky that but they just
[1:13:46] say well all we need to do is elect the
[1:13:48] right president all we need to do is
[1:13:50] have the FED change the rate all we need
[1:13:52] to do is to get this career all it need
[1:13:55] to do is complete my education you're
[1:13:57] you're living for a world that's dying
[1:14:00] underneath you hallelujah it's a house
[1:14:03] on fire burning to the ground and the
[1:14:05] judgments are real and they're happening
[1:14:08] in real time and they're happening to
[1:14:10] you right now what is your position do
[1:14:13] you hear the voice of the East Wind and
[1:14:16] you run to God for safety and say Lord I
[1:14:19] want to obey your word because there's
[1:14:21] no
[1:14:23] Escape except by your
[1:14:25] word thank you
[1:14:28] Lord he said that to them in
[1:14:31] Deuteronomy observe the month of abib
[1:14:34] and keep the Passover unto the Lord thy
[1:14:36] God for in the month of abib the Lord
[1:14:38] thy
[1:14:40] God brought thee forth out of Egypt by
[1:14:44] night so the hot wind coming
[1:14:48] in would not seem unusual to
[1:14:52] Pharaoh but little did he know
[1:14:55] that this year's hot wind would be
[1:14:59] unlike any
[1:15:01] other kamasan
[1:15:04] wind it packed a punch relative to the
[1:15:08] word of God coming forth relative to the
[1:15:11] command of the Lord that Pharaoh was
[1:15:14] under he could have avoided
[1:15:17] it he could have avoided it but it fell
[1:15:21] upon
[1:15:22] him as did the As did the ninth and the
[1:15:26] 10th plague this was number eight he'd
[1:15:28] already dealt with seven and he didn't
[1:15:31] hear the voice in the eighth and he
[1:15:32] didn't hear the voice in the n9th and he
[1:15:33] didn't hear the voice in the 10th until
[1:15:35] it was too late until finally God's will
[1:15:39] was obeyed what about you and I I hope
[1:15:44] today that you don't even need to to
[1:15:47] face an eighth or a ninth or a tenth I
[1:15:50] hope you don't need to experience one
[1:15:52] through seven you might be here today
[1:15:54] and you're sitting in the valley of
[1:15:56] decision and you're trying to make a
[1:15:57] decision about your life I'm here to
[1:15:59] tell you there's one road that leads to
[1:16:01] life there's many roads that seem like
[1:16:03] they lead to life but they lead to death
[1:16:06] and I want to say to you today choose
[1:16:08] God's word whatever you do uh don't pass
[1:16:12] go don't collect $200 go directly to
[1:16:15] God's word and say Lord let your will be
[1:16:19] manifested in my life cause me to
[1:16:23] surrender how many would say that today
[1:16:26] cause me to surrender to your
[1:16:29] word has not the word called for us to
[1:16:33] not come to the Wilderness like it
[1:16:35] called to Israel but it's called for a a
[1:16:38] a total separation from unbelief has the
[1:16:41] word called that that's the call of this
[1:16:43] day it's called us to complete
[1:16:45] dedication to the
[1:16:48] Lord so climate science does indeed
[1:16:52] provide some insights into the pH phenon
[1:16:55] described in Exodus 10 and so you know
[1:16:59] in the context of of The Exodus the East
[1:17:02] Wind would have seemed like today it
[1:17:05] would have seemed like a a natural
[1:17:08] means by which the locust
[1:17:11] swarm had been brought into Egypt they
[1:17:14] would have just dismissed it with
[1:17:18] science
[1:17:19] education politics like they're doing
[1:17:21] today they're dismissing all the
[1:17:24] calamities yeah they just dismiss it
[1:17:26] with
[1:17:27] social you know the social trends the
[1:17:31] political Trends the economic
[1:17:34] Trends oh
[1:17:37] friends second Peter let's read this one
[1:17:40] brother Mark second Peter chapter
[1:17:43] 3 Let's see if the word calls for us to
[1:17:47] ignore the voice of the impending
[1:17:51] judgments or should we be doing
[1:17:54] something about about
[1:17:56] it I want to read this and it's I'm
[1:17:58] going to read verses 2-4 it's lengthy
[1:18:01] because I want you to obsorb Simon's
[1:18:04] words now I'm not gonna quote you Jason
[1:18:08] Watkins I'm quoting you the Apostle
[1:18:12] himself St Peter amen not a saint
[1:18:16] because he died he was a saint while he
[1:18:18] was alive you have to be living to be a
[1:18:21] saint how you die that you come up the
[1:18:24] same way you go down there's no becoming
[1:18:26] a saint after you
[1:18:30] die verse two second Peter chapter
[1:18:34] 3:2 that ye may be mindful of The Words
[1:18:37] which were spoken before by the holy
[1:18:41] prophets and of the Commandment of us
[1:18:44] the Apostles of the Lord and Savior
[1:18:47] knowing this
[1:18:49] first that there shall come in the your
[1:18:53] days am I correct there shall come in
[1:18:57] the your
[1:18:58] days all right
[1:19:01] scoffers walking after their own lust
[1:19:04] and saying everything's
[1:19:07] normal where's the promise of his coming
[1:19:10] since the fathers fell asleep all things
[1:19:12] continue as they were from the beginning
[1:19:15] of the creation there's nothing new
[1:19:17] here there's been Wars there's been
[1:19:20] crazy people there's been bad
[1:19:22] politicians yeah there had been wind
[1:19:25] Pharaoh had felt that East Wind it
[1:19:27] wasn't the first time they had seen
[1:19:29] Locust but I'm here to tell you it had a
[1:19:31] whole Next Level effect on Egypt because
[1:19:35] it would literally spoil them to a
[1:19:36] degree they would never recover
[1:19:40] from there as a
[1:19:42] superpower their reign as a superpower
[1:19:45] would
[1:19:49] end verse four saying where's the
[1:19:51] promise of his coming for since the
[1:19:53] fathers fell asleep all things continue
[1:19:56] as they were from the beginning of
[1:19:57] creation are we reading about the end
[1:20:00] time don't lose sight of that verse
[1:20:04] five for this at the last day at the end
[1:20:08] time the people who are alive on the
[1:20:10] earth near the coming of the Lord
[1:20:11] willingly are ignorant
[1:20:14] of that by the word of God the heavens
[1:20:16] were of old and the Earth standing out
[1:20:18] of the water and in the water this he's
[1:20:19] going all the way back to Noah's
[1:20:21] destruction now they didn't believe Noah
[1:20:23] either
[1:20:25] see verse verse six whereby the world
[1:20:29] that then was being overflowed with
[1:20:31] water
[1:20:32] perished no
[1:20:34] kidding of course it did why cuz God
[1:20:38] said it would but nobody believed it
[1:20:40] didn't matter Noah believed it his
[1:20:43] family believed it they built an ark and
[1:20:46] they got on
[1:20:48] it verse seven but the heavens and the
[1:20:51] Earth which are now by the same word are
[1:20:55] kept in store reserved under Fire won't
[1:20:58] be water next time it'll be fire against
[1:21:00] the day of judgment and predition of
[1:21:02] ungodly men but beloved are you glad to
[1:21:05] be
[1:21:07] beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:21:12] thing that one day is with the Lord as a
[1:21:15] thousand years and a thousand years is
[1:21:17] one day the Lord is not slack concerning
[1:21:20] his promise don't think that just cuz
[1:21:23] it's getting crazy and crazier
[1:21:27] don't like oh sorry I I was my my
[1:21:31] attention was divided sorry it got so
[1:21:32] crazy okay I better get you guys out of
[1:21:34] here nothing
[1:21:35] doing God if God and listen do you
[1:21:38] believe God has you here on purpose does
[1:21:41] he do anything without a
[1:21:43] purpose then you've got a purpose in
[1:21:47] being here do you believe that then what
[1:21:50] is your purpose say I don't know ask God
[1:21:53] lord what is my purpose and I promise
[1:21:55] you he'll give you the answer the the
[1:21:58] that he will give you the answer is not
[1:22:00] in question what's in question is will
[1:22:03] you do
[1:22:05] it I'll do it well what if it interrupts
[1:22:07] your
[1:22:09] program well like what what if it
[1:22:12] completely changes all your plans now
[1:22:14] hold
[1:22:15] on what does that even mean what if it
[1:22:18] causes you to lose all your friends all
[1:22:21] your career all your Prestige you lose
[1:22:25] all your
[1:22:29] likes you have to you have to completely
[1:22:32] disassociate yourself from a a life that
[1:22:35] you formerly had and walk in a new way
[1:22:38] called the newness of Christ and there
[1:22:41] are people who say my life is so bad and
[1:22:45] I am so disgusted with what I am I will
[1:22:49] take it and there are some other people
[1:22:51] who just say this is normal and I don't
[1:22:54] want to change anything please leave me
[1:22:57] alone and when you talk to God that way
[1:23:00] that's exactly what he'll do he'll give
[1:23:02] you the desire of your heart and if you
[1:23:04] desire the world and the tribulation and
[1:23:06] going to hell he'll let you do
[1:23:08] it he doesn't want you to do it he
[1:23:10] doesn't want that for you he didn't put
[1:23:12] you here and give you life for that
[1:23:13] reason hell wasn't even made for humans
[1:23:17] hell was made for the devil and his
[1:23:18] angels the hell hath enlarged itself
[1:23:21] like an overcrowded prison they had to
[1:23:22] build on new Wings to receive Humanity
[1:23:24] who wouldn't receive God starting with
[1:23:25] the days of Noah and Jesus went down and
[1:23:28] preached to them souls in prison they'd
[1:23:31] already been there for a couple thousand
[1:23:33] years almost and he said to them you
[1:23:35] ought to have listened to
[1:23:38] Noah oh save us you're the Savior not
[1:23:41] for you I was a savior my Ark that was
[1:23:44] me the ark Noah was building that was
[1:23:46] going to be me if you have believed you
[1:23:48] i' have built one big enough for
[1:23:50] you there is a family here who kept my
[1:23:53] word and I'm taking them with me when I
[1:23:56] leave Hallelujah friends I'm glad that
[1:23:59] the that the mighty Angel who has come
[1:24:01] down in our day when he leaves the Earth
[1:24:04] he's taking me with him he's taking you
[1:24:07] and I he won't leave our soul in Hell
[1:24:09] neither will he suffer our holy his holy
[1:24:11] one to see
[1:24:17] corruption verse 10 again but the day of
[1:24:20] the Lord will come it will it will
[1:24:25] it
[1:24:27] will it'll come as a thief in the
[1:24:30] night in the which the heavens shall
[1:24:32] pass away shall shall with a great noise
[1:24:35] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:24:37] heat the Earth also and the works that
[1:24:40] are therein shall be burnt up seeing
[1:24:43] then do you see
[1:24:45] it seeing then that all these things
[1:24:48] shall be dissolved what manner of person
[1:24:53] ought ye to be
[1:24:55] in all godl in all holy conversation and
[1:25:01] godliness see so it ain't just it ain't
[1:25:03] just Pastor Jason in your business today
[1:25:05] this is Simon
[1:25:07] Peter
[1:25:09] amen come on young people this is Peter
[1:25:12] chatting you up
[1:25:14] today seeing that all these things you
[1:25:16] see them happening why would you believe
[1:25:19] the it's the end of the story like it
[1:25:20] tells it's not going to happen so if you
[1:25:22] believe it's going to happen what are
[1:25:23] you doing
[1:25:25] what what are you doing what's your
[1:25:26] Pursuits where where's your life going
[1:25:28] what are your determinations what are
[1:25:30] you valuing we've been preaching on what
[1:25:32] do you
[1:25:35] value verse 12 looking for and hastening
[1:25:38] unto the coming of the day of God
[1:25:40] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[1:25:42] be dissolved the elements shall melt
[1:25:45] with fervent heat that's the question
[1:25:47] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:25:49] look for new heavens and a new Earth
[1:25:52] wherein dwelleth righteousness
[1:25:54] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[1:25:57] for such things be diligent that you may
[1:26:01] be found of him in peace without spot
[1:26:03] and
[1:26:05] blameless so this isn't just me you know
[1:26:09] trying to put you in a bad frame of mind
[1:26:11] today I'm here as an as an as an angel
[1:26:14] of Mercy I'm here to bring a warning
[1:26:17] that the Lord has brought to my heart a
[1:26:19] burden of the word for us as his people
[1:26:22] what are you doing with the word God has
[1:26:24] revealed to you you think you
[1:26:26] accidentally came into it you think you
[1:26:27] accidentally got born into this kind of
[1:26:29] a into the family you're in you think
[1:26:31] you accidentally met that
[1:26:33] believer what are the odds come on that
[1:26:37] you met a child of God some young woman
[1:26:39] met a Son of God what are the odds what
[1:26:42] some young man met a daughter of God
[1:26:44] what are the
[1:26:45] odds oh the the the the odds you know
[1:26:49] it's it's crazy what the atheist thinks
[1:26:52] and and and he even sign science
[1:26:55] proves that that I mean the the the
[1:26:58] whole universe is just hanging by almost
[1:27:01] like a thread that if even too much of
[1:27:05] this or not enough of that and the whole
[1:27:07] universe could collapse right and how is
[1:27:11] it that it just so happens to be
[1:27:13] precisely what it needs to
[1:27:15] be how how could you think there's not a
[1:27:18] a Divine mind behind that my goodness do
[1:27:23] do you think that you accidentally came
[1:27:25] into this building today do you think
[1:27:28] that was an accident there are no
[1:27:30] accidents with God's word he's here
[1:27:33] today to try to help you will you hear
[1:27:36] the voice of the East Wind that's coming
[1:27:39] upon the world it's irrevocable there's
[1:27:43] no turning back it's
[1:27:48] coming the presence of the
[1:27:53] judgments literally were aligning with
[1:27:56] historical understanding of locust
[1:27:58] migrations and the role of the wind and
[1:28:01] their dispersal so it just didn't seem
[1:28:03] odd to
[1:28:05] Pharaoh he had a way to legitimately
[1:28:09] explain it
[1:28:11] away Moses you're hysterical it doesn't
[1:28:14] mean
[1:28:15] that what you think these locusts
[1:28:17] plaguing your land yeah we get these
[1:28:20] guys saying our first rodeo get out of
[1:28:23] here you holy R
[1:28:25] ER see and so so we find that that that
[1:28:33] literally science was was
[1:28:35] acknowledging that that the wind
[1:28:37] patterns were what were playing the
[1:28:39] critical role in the movement of these
[1:28:41] Locust swarms the critical element the
[1:28:44] critical
[1:28:46] element that they were
[1:28:50] overlooking climate science told them
[1:28:53] these winds come
[1:28:54] climate science told them it's not even
[1:28:57] unusual this time of year climate
[1:29:00] science told them this is what's
[1:29:02] responsible for the Locust we can
[1:29:03] explain it and there's a whole and I'm
[1:29:06] not even going to deal with it today
[1:29:07] there's a whole I did in my research
[1:29:09] there's a whole thing I've left off of
[1:29:11] my notes about how Locust swarms and the
[1:29:14] whole dichotomy and and and the whole
[1:29:16] way it breaks down and and I didn't even
[1:29:17] want to go into the science of it today
[1:29:19] my my point is that that to them it the
[1:29:23] winds were normal the locusts were
[1:29:25] always a possibility on these East Winds
[1:29:28] what they were failing to remember the
[1:29:31] critical element that they were
[1:29:34] overlooking was that God was in control
[1:29:37] of the
[1:29:38] Winds God was in control of the Locust
[1:29:42] God was in control of the judgments his
[1:29:46] word that was declared on the ungodly
[1:29:49] nation and and and and here is the one
[1:29:53] that's Worthy of Glory the one that is
[1:29:56] Seated on the throne that all nature
[1:29:59] obeys him as the disciples said even the
[1:30:02] winds and the waves follow his orders
[1:30:06] and here his word had declared it and
[1:30:08] all nature observed it and all nature
[1:30:11] had always observed it and all nature is
[1:30:13] observing it
[1:30:16] today the East Wind in the bible let me
[1:30:19] just turn a corner and and run for the
[1:30:21] finish line here you good I want to give
[1:30:24] some more just some I'm not going to
[1:30:25] read them I'm just going to refer to
[1:30:27] them you can make a note of it we've
[1:30:29] already read about Exodus 10 how that
[1:30:31] the in verse 13 how that the East Wind
[1:30:34] the East Wind brought the plague of
[1:30:37] locust Jeremiah 18 and 17 God declares
[1:30:41] that he will scatter his own people
[1:30:43] before the enemy like an East Wind as a
[1:30:45] form of
[1:30:47] judgment his own
[1:30:49] people God loves you so much that you
[1:30:53] say he'll help me defeat the enemy not
[1:30:56] if you're not standing on his word he'll
[1:30:58] actually allow you to be scattered by
[1:31:00] the East Wind you his people he declares
[1:31:03] it this was Jeremiah's warning to Israel
[1:31:07] you think CA you've got an ark you think
[1:31:09] because you carry a Bible you think
[1:31:12] because you can pull up a prophet's
[1:31:13] quotes somehow the devil's afraid of
[1:31:18] that it's not it's not the Moses Rod was
[1:31:23] the name of Jesus for us
[1:31:25] today but Satan is not afraid of
[1:31:28] Jesus it's the life behind the name that
[1:31:32] demons fear and tremble see Ezekiel
[1:31:36] 17:10 an East Winds uh an East Wind
[1:31:40] Withers the vine and it symbolizes
[1:31:43] Israel's impending judgment Psalms 48:7
[1:31:46] the East Wind breaks the ships of tares
[1:31:49] tares which can often be interpreted as
[1:31:52] God's Divine judgment Hosea 1315 an East
[1:31:55] Wind representing the wind of the Lord
[1:31:57] coming from the Wilderness will dry up
[1:32:00] all the springs and it will plunder all
[1:32:02] the treasures so I don't care how secure
[1:32:05] you feel today and your Springs are full
[1:32:07] and your Treasures are overflowing and
[1:32:10] you got so much water and treasure trust
[1:32:12] me the East Wind can come and dry it up
[1:32:16] and plunder all your
[1:32:20] Treasures it was even an East Wind that
[1:32:23] God appointed and Jonah 4 that that
[1:32:26] scorching East Wind that caused Jonah
[1:32:28] all of his discomfort there and we can
[1:32:31] see that as a form of a of a personal
[1:32:33] trial or a personal judgment Exodus 14
[1:32:36] the Lord used an East Wind to part the
[1:32:38] Red Sea allowing the Israelites to
[1:32:41] escape Egypt which led to then led to
[1:32:43] the judgments of the pursuing Egyptians
[1:32:46] brother brandom said it like this that
[1:32:48] God looked at the Sea and the Sea got
[1:32:52] scared and rolled back it's whoa oh he's
[1:32:56] looking at us back up back up back up
[1:32:59] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:33:00] let God look down in my life today let
[1:33:03] every demon fear at the view of God
[1:33:06] looking at me and looking at you I want
[1:33:08] to I I I'm happy that God is bringing
[1:33:11] judgment uh that's going to bring my
[1:33:15] Deliverance why do you want to be
[1:33:17] delivered I don't want to go to hell I
[1:33:19] don't want to be in the tribulation I
[1:33:20] don't want to do despite to the grace of
[1:33:23] Christ I don't want to serve the devil I
[1:33:25] don't want to be influenced by demons I
[1:33:27] don't there's no love I have for
[1:33:29] Hollywood there's no love I have for
[1:33:31] this for this world this broken world of
[1:33:34] Injustice and inequity where all you
[1:33:36] have to do is have enough influence and
[1:33:38] enough money you can get away with
[1:33:40] murder I don't want a society like that
[1:33:43] I want a king who's righteous who is
[1:33:46] Equitable and fair a king who will rule
[1:33:50] the Earth in Holiness I want Holiness I
[1:33:53] want Holiness I want it all around me I
[1:33:55] want it in my home I want it in my life
[1:33:57] I want it wherever I go I want the
[1:34:00] beauty of
[1:34:02] Holiness how do you want that be you
[1:34:04] were born in sin yes but I'm not in sin
[1:34:07] anymore somebody found me and made me a
[1:34:11] new creation in Christ
[1:34:15] Jesus so they show how that the East
[1:34:18] Wind is a powerful symbol of God's
[1:34:20] control over nature powerful symbol of
[1:34:22] his ability to bring judgments through
[1:34:25] it it's it's the East wind's role is is
[1:34:29] is many times in some scriptures is
[1:34:31] really a metaphor in in a Biblical
[1:34:33] narrative because it's
[1:34:35] representing it's representing God's
[1:34:39] intervention it's representing God's
[1:34:41] judgment and we find that it it also
[1:34:45] speaks of stopping or blocking or
[1:34:50] upending the futility of of human effort
[1:34:53] and human Endeavors and human
[1:34:57] plans and you know friends as much as I
[1:35:01] love
[1:35:01] you and I love you with a great
[1:35:04] love and I would never be able to endure
[1:35:07] saying some of the things that have to
[1:35:09] be said to you whom I
[1:35:12] love if it were not for a greater love
[1:35:15] that I want to see you make
[1:35:17] it and there's sometimes I just have to
[1:35:20] look out across this audience and look
[1:35:22] into your loving eyes and say you're on
[1:35:24] the wrong path your endeavors are going
[1:35:27] to bring chaos you need to change course
[1:35:31] right now you need to flip the script
[1:35:34] and don't keep going because I hear the
[1:35:37] voice of an East Wind
[1:35:40] coming the East Winds role is
[1:35:43] powerful and so whenever God is speaking
[1:35:47] in his word the East Wind in the Bible
[1:35:48] is almost always a negative thing almost
[1:35:51] always I'm not even reading them all I'm
[1:35:53] skipping just to to save time I want to
[1:35:55] close in 10 minutes but I mean there's
[1:35:58] scriptures where he talks about your
[1:35:59] crops there's drought they're scorching
[1:36:03] it just goes on and on and on job 27
[1:36:07] let's catch this one brother Mark before
[1:36:09] we go off the air job
[1:36:11] 27 and I'll give you a couple of verses
[1:36:14] here three 19 through
[1:36:18] 21 this is such
[1:36:21] a this is sad the rich man shall lie
[1:36:25] down but he shall not be
[1:36:28] gathered he openeth his eyes and he is
[1:36:31] not Terrors take hold on him as Waters a
[1:36:35] tempest stealth him away in the night
[1:36:38] the East Wind carrieth him away and he
[1:36:42] departeth and as the storm hurth him out
[1:36:45] of his
[1:36:48] place many uh not just rich men many
[1:36:54] men many
[1:36:57] women they just went to
[1:37:00] bed like any other
[1:37:02] night the East wind was blowing they
[1:37:05] didn't hear the voice of the Lord in it
[1:37:08] they closed their
[1:37:09] eyes like they have done all their
[1:37:13] life sometimes they were in their 90s
[1:37:16] sometimes in their 40s sometimes in
[1:37:18] their teens and they closed their eyes
[1:37:22] but when they woke up and and they
[1:37:23] opened their eyes again they weren't in
[1:37:25] the world
[1:37:27] anymore something had came in the night
[1:37:30] and stolen them
[1:37:32] away an East Wind that no one heard and
[1:37:35] no one felt rolled in and just whisked
[1:37:38] their soul into
[1:37:41] eternity and they open their eyes and
[1:37:44] they found out that they are were not I
[1:37:48] was now I'm
[1:37:50] not what happened well I was no I'm
[1:37:55] not where are you uh Terrors have taken
[1:37:59] hold as Waters in Tempest and something
[1:38:02] stole me in the night the East Wind
[1:38:04] carried me away the it the the storm
[1:38:07] hurled me I I got hurled I was in my bed
[1:38:10] asleep and something came in the night
[1:38:12] that no one heard the storm and it
[1:38:14] literally lifted my soul out of my body
[1:38:16] and hurled me into
[1:38:22] Oblivion what about about the West Wind
[1:38:25] The North Wind and the south
[1:38:30] wind very quickly there's only one
[1:38:33] mention in the Bible of a West Wind and
[1:38:35] that's found there in Exodus 10 when the
[1:38:39] Lord shifted the East Wind that had
[1:38:41] brought the Locust in and the West Wind
[1:38:44] became a a wind of Deliverance and blew
[1:38:47] the Locust Locust out into the Red Sea
[1:38:50] and drowned them so so a West Wind is a
[1:38:56] deliverer of
[1:38:58] plagues The North Wind there are two
[1:39:01] references to the north wind and they're
[1:39:02] both found in Proverbs 25 where it says
[1:39:06] that the north wind brings forth terrain
[1:39:09] and and and in the and in the Song of
[1:39:12] Solomon where the north wind is said to
[1:39:14] awaken and is used poetically as the
[1:39:18] means by which the fragrance of the
[1:39:20] garden is spread so in other words we we
[1:39:25] find that this that that the west wind
[1:39:28] is a wind of Deliverance the West Wind
[1:39:30] delivers the plagues The North Wind
[1:39:34] increases your land and the north wind
[1:39:37] doesn't just give you more stuff The
[1:39:40] North Wind stir up the fragrance like a
[1:39:42] garden and your whole life becomes a
[1:39:45] fragrance of those around you oh I want
[1:39:48] a I want a North Wind hallelujah
[1:39:52] hallelujah the South Wind there are five
[1:39:55] instances of the phrase south
[1:39:57] wind and I love this they speak of the
[1:40:01] land oh my I just paused for the longest
[1:40:05] time on this five instances of the
[1:40:09] phrase south wind and they speak of the
[1:40:13] land being
[1:40:15] still job talks about it that God
[1:40:19] directed the south wind in that in
[1:40:22] Psalms 7 78 and in reference to
[1:40:25] Discerning of times if we go we don't
[1:40:27] have time today we could go to Luke 12
[1:40:29] but literally that it's the driving of a
[1:40:32] ship by the wind you can read that in
[1:40:33] the book of Acts and so you know so you
[1:40:37] have a West Wind that is a Deliverance
[1:40:42] you have H A North Wind that literally
[1:40:46] increases your territory and and
[1:40:50] Blossoms your life out into a fruitful
[1:40:54] bow a fragrant Garden you have a North
[1:40:57] Wind which which helps to guide your
[1:40:59] life a North Wind a North Wind which uh
[1:41:03] I'm sorry a south wind which which
[1:41:05] causes the land to be still or it drives
[1:41:09] you forward so it's whatever God as long
[1:41:12] as God's in
[1:41:14] control sometimes God is moving your
[1:41:16] ship across the water and sometimes God
[1:41:19] just gives you peace sometimes you're
[1:41:20] not moving at all but sometimes it's a
[1:41:23] peace that passes all understanding you
[1:41:25] might even be in the middle of a trial
[1:41:26] you might be in the middle of Affliction
[1:41:28] but there's
[1:41:29] peace oh Hallelujah there there there's
[1:41:32] also this I want to get you this one
[1:41:34] before we go there is that we found out
[1:41:37] in job 15 there is the filling oneself
[1:41:41] with the East Wind now we're back to the
[1:41:42] East Wind because that's what they
[1:41:44] accused jobab he had all this flowery
[1:41:46] speech trying to explain you know trying
[1:41:48] to defend himself is what he was doing
[1:41:51] and he he wasn't giving God the glory
[1:41:53] that God deserved and job was lifting up
[1:41:56] his own self and and this beautiful
[1:42:00] oratory and and and one of the accusers
[1:42:03] basically accused him of filling himself
[1:42:05] with the East with the East Wind job uh
[1:42:08] 15:22 should a wise man utter vain
[1:42:11] knowledge and fill his belly with the
[1:42:13] East Wind th in this term it simply
[1:42:16] meant that job's words blew hard but
[1:42:19] they were
[1:42:21] useless they were boisterous and bold
[1:42:24] and they made a lot of noise bless God
[1:42:27] bless God I have blessed god well I'll
[1:42:31] tell you right now and it all is useless
[1:42:34] the reality was that job was in trouble
[1:42:38] and until job could understand God's
[1:42:40] position in the trial and humble himself
[1:42:44] all it is he's just full of hot
[1:42:46] air sometimes Believers get like that
[1:42:49] and they they Thunder around and stomp
[1:42:51] around and they they make
[1:42:53] uh proclamations and I'll tell you I got
[1:42:56] faith for this and I got faith for that
[1:42:58] and bless God I've been a Believer all
[1:42:59] this and and a lot of times what you
[1:43:01] need instead of standing up beating the
[1:43:03] air you need to fall on your face and
[1:43:05] say God Take Me Away From Here re come
[1:43:10] and come into my life and change me
[1:43:13] completely that's what job
[1:43:15] needed it meant words that are they blow
[1:43:18] hard but they're useless words that
[1:43:20] sound great but have no purpose in other
[1:43:23] the words vain knowledge windy knowledge
[1:43:25] the world is full of it the world is
[1:43:28] filled with windy knowledge vain
[1:43:31] knowledge vain worship but there is a
[1:43:34] true worship there is a true Living God
[1:43:37] there is a true knowledge and it might
[1:43:40] contradict everything the world is
[1:43:41] telling you and my advice to you today
[1:43:44] is forsake the world and follow the word
[1:43:47] that's the only source of life that
[1:43:49] there
[1:43:52] is people sometimes don't realize the
[1:43:56] futility now I'm just I'm done with our
[1:43:59] scriptures can I just give you my heart
[1:44:00] for five or 10 minutes
[1:44:05] am I've preached this whole sermon to
[1:44:08] come to this part and I'm at the bottom
[1:44:10] of my
[1:44:13] notes
[1:44:16] people sometimes God's own
[1:44:18] family sometimes I've been guilty of it
[1:44:22] myself
[1:44:24] sometimes we don't realize the futility
[1:44:27] of filling ourselves with the East
[1:44:30] Wind making all these bold
[1:44:34] declarations and you know brother Brown
[1:44:36] comes to the end of his sermon and and
[1:44:38] he says now how many enjoyed the word
[1:44:40] tonight you can hear on the tape you can
[1:44:42] hear all the audience oh hallelujah amen
[1:44:44] he says all right now I'm glad you
[1:44:46] enjoyed it he said but now my real
[1:44:48] question see it was a trick question he
[1:44:51] he let them in did you enjoy it yes all
[1:44:53] right now my real question will you do
[1:44:56] it will you go out of here today and do
[1:45:00] it otherwise you're not hearing the
[1:45:02] voice in the East Wind because I promise
[1:45:03] you the East Wind is coming it's not
[1:45:05] even coming it's here it's blowing on
[1:45:07] the Earth right now and it's not going
[1:45:09] to go away that that East Wind was just
[1:45:12] another precursor to Egypt's complete
[1:45:15] undoing God is going to to take his
[1:45:19] family out of the earth and because
[1:45:21] she's the B in word because the she has
[1:45:24] the life and the word is in her she has
[1:45:27] the token life as brother Matt was
[1:45:28] preaching for us Wednesday when the
[1:45:30] bride leaves the Earth the blood leaves
[1:45:32] the Earth and then God sees the Earth
[1:45:34] with all of its sin and we're not here
[1:45:36] he that lth will let till he be taken
[1:45:39] out of the way when the bride goes Mercy
[1:45:41] goes with it the blood goes with it and
[1:45:44] you don't want to be here friends I
[1:45:45] promise you you don't want to be
[1:45:48] here and sometimes people don't realize
[1:45:50] the futility of filling themselves with
[1:45:53] the East Wind and the reason for this
[1:45:55] happening a lot of time is very logical
[1:45:57] a lot of it it really comes down to life
[1:45:59] is just too short it's just too
[1:46:01] short and so by the time the judgment is
[1:46:04] realized it's already upon you because
[1:46:07] your life is just a
[1:46:09] vapor you you know trust me I know what
[1:46:11] I'm talking about one day you're 20 and
[1:46:13] the next day you're 60 and it just takes
[1:46:15] a few
[1:46:16] days and you can you can hardly believe
[1:46:19] it in your mind you don't feel like that
[1:46:22] but but you look in the mirror and tell
[1:46:24] my goodness what
[1:46:26] happened how did I get
[1:46:30] here and so because life is so short and
[1:46:34] then people don't they they don't
[1:46:36] realize a lot of times the
[1:46:38] futility of all of their bold dreams
[1:46:41] their bold plans which are contrary to
[1:46:48] this they they're
[1:46:50] certainly agree in agreement with the
[1:46:52] world but they're very much in in in in
[1:46:55] in contrary to
[1:46:57] this but because their life is so short
[1:47:00] by the time the judgment is realized
[1:47:02] it's already on them they're not they're
[1:47:04] not able to comprehend let me let me
[1:47:06] just say it to you how I how I said it
[1:47:07] to myself they're not able to comprehend
[1:47:11] the High Altitude view that God looks
[1:47:14] from to set their priorities correctly
[1:47:17] see he's trying to set your priorities
[1:47:20] correctly because he's way up here yeah
[1:47:23] and your life is down here at Ground
[1:47:24] Zero and it's very short it's a blip on
[1:47:26] the
[1:47:27] radar and before you know it you're done
[1:47:29] before you know it you're already in the
[1:47:31] midst of East Wind and you don't even
[1:47:32] know how you got
[1:47:34] there and and and but but but a lot of
[1:47:38] times people can't comprehend that high
[1:47:40] altitude view that God looks from and it
[1:47:43] can't occur to
[1:47:46] them that
[1:47:48] consequences not often not seeable for
[1:47:52] DEC
[1:47:55] decades formed within the decade they're
[1:48:01] in you get
[1:48:05] me
[1:48:07] seeds of
[1:48:10] discrepancy if you forget everything
[1:48:12] I've said today remember this one seeds
[1:48:15] of discrepancy which is anything
[1:48:17] contrary to these seeds Jesus called
[1:48:20] this a seed it's good seed you put it in
[1:48:23] the ground it'll
[1:48:24] grow seeds of discrepancy are when you
[1:48:27] when you change
[1:48:29] this seeds of discrepancy are the most
[1:48:32] reliable crop you can
[1:48:36] plant they don't even require Faith to
[1:48:39] make them come
[1:48:41] up the sinful Fallen World you live in
[1:48:46] will bring them to
[1:48:47] harvest with or without your
[1:48:51] cooperation
[1:48:53] this is exactly
[1:48:55] why that a high altitude view of God's
[1:48:59] prophets are so
[1:49:03] valuable this is why God warns his
[1:49:07] people through prophets because like
[1:49:10] eagles prophets are called Eagles
[1:49:13] they're the ones who are built by the
[1:49:15] Lord to fly high enough to see the
[1:49:18] regrets you'll
[1:49:20] have when you fill your life
[1:49:23] with the East
[1:49:34] Wind I hope
[1:49:37] today that just
[1:49:40] maybe you could be so impacted by this
[1:49:44] service and this
[1:49:45] sermon that you will say Lord I don't
[1:49:49] want East Wind in my life I I want West
[1:49:52] Wind
[1:49:53] I want
[1:49:54] Deliverance I I I want North Wind I want
[1:49:58] the fragrance of your life I want a
[1:50:00] south wind I want peace in my life I
[1:50:03] don't want an East Wind I want a North
[1:50:05] Wind I want a West Wind I want a south
[1:50:07] wind how many today would say that to
[1:50:09] the Lord say Lord grab me West Wind if
[1:50:12] I'm if I'm in a fix and I've got myself
[1:50:14] in a fix send me the West Wind deliver
[1:50:17] me take this plague out of my life bring
[1:50:20] me a south wind that brings peace in my
[1:50:22] life bring me a south wind that'll drive
[1:50:24] my ship across the life sea bring me a
[1:50:27] North Wind that'll cause my territory to
[1:50:30] expand and and not just expand but my
[1:50:33] life will become a fragrance a fragrance
[1:50:36] of righteousness a fragrance of Holiness
[1:50:39] you want the joy of the Lord that's your
[1:50:42] strength let the Lord pour upon you the
[1:50:45] oil of gladness today let the Lord come
[1:50:48] in and change your whole life and say
[1:50:50] I'll take the East Wind away hear the
[1:50:53] voice in it respond and I'll bring West
[1:50:56] Wind I'll bring North Wind I'll bring
[1:50:58] south wind and you'll never have to have
[1:51:00] the East Wind again oh Grant it to me
[1:51:03] Lord stand on your feet with me how many
[1:51:06] would want that today say Lord God may I
[1:51:09] never never be a victim of the East Wind
[1:51:13] again oh Hallelujah Lord Jesus today
[1:51:17] Lord we've spent time in this word and
[1:51:19] we've proven to the people back and
[1:51:21] forth back and forth through the
[1:51:23] scriptures Lord all through the Old
[1:51:25] Testament I didn't even hardly get into
[1:51:27] the New Testament passages we could have
[1:51:28] went to but Lord we realize this world
[1:51:32] is falling apart it's going to Ash and
[1:51:35] Cinder Lord oh I wish the people could
[1:51:37] see that it's going to Ash and Cinder I
[1:51:40] don't care what you're chasing it's
[1:51:41] going to Ash and
[1:51:44] Cinder Lord I want North Wind in my life
[1:51:49] I want West Wind in my life I want South
[1:51:53] Wind in my life I don't want East
[1:51:57] Wind all heads bowed
[1:51:59] now all hearts and heads bowed before
[1:52:02] the
[1:52:07] Lord Lamb of
[1:52:11] God Father of
[1:52:14] Lights creator of heavens and earth and
[1:52:17] all that
[1:52:18] is all good things come down from above
[1:52:21] from you
[1:52:23] the Father of Lights in you Lord there's
[1:52:25] no
[1:52:26] Shadow there's no variableness you're
[1:52:29] you're always the same you're so
[1:52:30] reliably the same you always respond to
[1:52:35] repentance you always respond to a
[1:52:37] contrite heart you love a contrite
[1:52:40] heart that's what job needed and he was
[1:52:43] your child that's what Pharaoh needed he
[1:52:46] never got
[1:52:47] it he
[1:52:51] refused
[1:52:53] I know the Bible says the Lord hardened
[1:52:55] his heart but that's only be that was
[1:52:57] only a consequence of the seeds of
[1:52:59] discrepancy of 400 years of evily
[1:53:01] mistreating God's people that se that
[1:53:03] crop had to grow Pharaoh did that to
[1:53:06] himself only thing God did in hardening
[1:53:08] his heart was caused this nature to take
[1:53:10] its course and and that seed came
[1:53:12] forward and Pharaoh became a victim of
[1:53:15] his own
[1:53:17] tyranny did that to himself just like
[1:53:19] the world
[1:53:20] will the world will do it to them M
[1:53:22] themselves Lord you won't destroy the
[1:53:24] Earth you love the Earth you won't
[1:53:25] destroy people you you'll move out of
[1:53:27] the way
[1:53:29] finally and let them have at
[1:53:32] it and they'll annihilate their own self
[1:53:34] from the face of the Earth
[1:53:37] Lord but high up in the
[1:53:40] atmospheres somewhere beyond the blue
[1:53:43] there will be a people standing with you
[1:53:46] rejoicing to say I chose the way with
[1:53:49] the Lord's despised few I made a change
[1:53:53] in my life I came to my senses I heard
[1:53:56] the voice in the East Wind the world
[1:54:01] didn't hear it my other friends didn't
[1:54:03] hear it but I heard it it called to me
[1:54:08] the child you don't have to suffer
[1:54:10] that this this judgment you can avoid it
[1:54:13] you don't have to suffer it this plague
[1:54:16] you can move you can come to me that's
[1:54:18] what Moses said all who are on the
[1:54:20] Lord's Side come to me
[1:54:23] I thank you Lord God for a high altitude
[1:54:25] prophet in this day who could see these
[1:54:28] things who could give me understanding
[1:54:31] of what I'm
[1:54:33] seeing the Holy Spirit could reveal it
[1:54:36] to my heart and all these things were
[1:54:39] the love of God but yet at the end of
[1:54:41] the
[1:54:42] day I still had to
[1:54:45] choose I still had to accept your
[1:54:48] unconditional
[1:54:51] pardon
[1:54:54] Lord you'll
[1:54:55] never condemn a man for being a sinner
[1:54:58] you'll never do that the man was born a
[1:55:03] sinner you you're you're not unjust the
[1:55:06] man was born a sinner he didn't even
[1:55:08] volunteer to come that way according to
[1:55:09] St Paul he was subjugated to
[1:55:13] that you'll never condemn a man for
[1:55:16] being a sinner he was born a sinner what
[1:55:18] will condemn the man or the woman the
[1:55:20] boy or the girl is is that they remained
[1:55:23] a sinner when they didn't have
[1:55:26] to God so loved the world that he gave
[1:55:29] his only begotten son that whoever would
[1:55:31] believe in him would not
