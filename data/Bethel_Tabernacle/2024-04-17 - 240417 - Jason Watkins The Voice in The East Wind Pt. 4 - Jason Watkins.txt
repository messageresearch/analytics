Lord amen amen praise the Lord God bless you young man who who's this Nehemiah have I met you before okay okay that doesn't mean a lot if I met fortunately amen but we're happy to make your acquaintance again God bless you Sister in the back there God bless you all greet you in the name of the Lord we're going to turn right to Revelation Chapter 2 God bless you in the back praise the Lord happy to have you here this evening praise God we're continuing tonight per my announcement our fourth installment on the little series we're working on The Voice in the East Wind tonight will be part four and um we won't get to everything but uh especially it's a Wednesday I'll be very careful on my time amen and then we're um gon to pick it back up the Lord willing next time Amen Brother JD will be covering base for me this Sunday uh I'll be away amen for a certain reason amen praise the Lord so amen amen oh yeah yeah there he is there he is okay praise God so um amen when we when we when you see us again uh there will be a change amen praise God praise God so we're looking for forward to that amen I've never had to travel three states to marry somebody so uh it's had to be yeah amen praise the Lord all right Revelation chap 2 and we're going to catch verses 12- 17 the pergami and age now before I read this I want to make just a point before as we go into it you you're going to want to understand that all the messages to all the angels of all the ages a message to each angel of each age does not become true in that age it's just simply a revelation of an eternal truth that had always been true amen so in fact is when you when you read this you're going to find a number of things that look like it would just be applying to this AG but actually brother brandham is going to push it all the way out and particularly the hidden Mana which we've been talking about quite a bit we dealt with it a little bit Sunday and so we want to look at it uh some more this evening but I just want that in your mind lest you think that well whatever was applying here doesn't apply to us you better hope it does you better hope that everything of the lion and of the ox and the man is in the eagle because I'll promise you everything in the White Horse and the red horse and the black horse is in the Pale Horse amen so you're going to need it you know brother Matt and I were in the back and we were talking about I had to ask him have you ever heard of this word and I'm I'm pretty Adept at at at at archaic words because of a lot of the commentary I read are you know Brilliant Minds from yester year but I'd never heard this word uh heterodox I said' Matt you ever heard of heterodox what is heterodox and so I looked at and so I had to look it up and the reason it came came up is because this uh Spurgeon is the editor he's the one who did this Bible and he has his own handwritten note here uh and he's saying right in the middle of the pergami and age he says let none of us imagine that an orthodox Creed can be of any use used to us if we lead a heterodox life so let me just modernize that a little bit there there there's no Doctrine however true and you believe it to be true but if your life doesn't match the word then that Doctrine to you is really a of almost none very limited use gives you some understanding and so if for no other reason reason that you can see that Charles Spurgeon was having to deal with people in churches claiming to be Christians but not living a real Christian lifestyle so that's not a 20th or 21st century problem Spurgeon was dealing with it all the way back here when he was teaching and so so so now that gives you another piece of evidence to see that you know he's the same Christ is the same yesterday today and forever ever and so everything that we're going to read here now has direct not an indirect it has direct application to our lives right now in 2024 all right enough teaching on the scripture before we read the scripture verse 12 and to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my name and H has not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught Balo to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacri riced unto idols and to commit fornication brother Brandon went right back to the Old Testament in the book of numbers and picked up that story and brought it in one of the most powerful sermons we have in the message verse 15 so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear is an important verse it's at the end of every age he that hath and there's a reason it is we're going to deal with that in a minute he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh you want to overcome will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it now I'm not teaching per se tonight on the pergamano speed on the things that we're dealing with the spirit of balum we're dealing with the nickan thing see we're dealing with Satan seat had a historical meaning back here and brother brandom explains it uh how that adelus III fled Babylon into pergamus but then it moved into Rome and it's never listed in pergamus again never shown to be back there again it's now in Rome s SE is so that part of it is historically referencing an exact frame but the greater principles of it chiefly that one at the end he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches amen all right let's uh let's pray father we thank you and we're asking now for your Divine unction Lord upon the word we commit ourselves into your hands Lord my mind now father may you just take over everything let our hearts be pure before you we commit it to you now it's important Lord It's Your word there's nothing more important you value it above your name Lord and so I pray that you will come right now Lord and bring and break the bread of life in these important times we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated I'm continuing in this series and I debated whether to continue with the title The Voice in the East Wind and I decided to carry on this in this service and again and maybe even a sixth or seventh part we're not sure got a lot of material in front of me that I'm not going to get to tonight but I'm going to tell you something friends we're in a we're in an amazing hour and it's a very trying time that tries The Souls of men we're in a we're in the in the the last of the last age I I've stopped saying you know that we're just at the end time because we're actually at the end of the end time and there are no more ages all seven stars in his right hand have been deployed the bride has her final message amen the next Revival goes to Israel and so we realize that what the bride is waiting for uh is is is a a daily greater and greater and greater manifestation say how long all the way to the body change this is a unique hour as I said to you last Sunday you are living in a very unique hour and I I started to put it up on a PowerPoint and show probably a half a dozen or more things thank you brother Tony that make the hour that we live in unique from all other ages prior to this age and so one of the things that stands out the most is that this is the age where the Saints brother brandham said he says that the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we've worked in a small way he goes on down and goes on he starts talking about he says where that that the the body of Christ that she'll come into such an a a matching image of Christ that he said Saints for hundreds of years and even thousands of years will rise from the graves around the world and we would which are alive and remain shall be changed that's never happened before on a global scale so we realize that we have gone back under under Redemption we've gone back under restoration of the word to where that first age after the death of the Apostles it apexed and began to decline and we have gone back with this message to that point where they began to tip over and decline down and we have now been brought back to that that point and we take it on into a body change amen Lord all right so we read this quote to you so so I think it's necessary then that I carry on with the voice in the East Wind because the East Wind is Judgment we've been teaching on that and so the world is facing its judgment time it's facing Total Insanity it's facing Satan's Eden it's facing where Lucifer himself has been elected by the people to to be the worshiped being of the age he is the God of this evil age all of these things are unprecedented in in the history of the church going all the way back even into the Old Testament so it's a unique hour but you're a unique people and you're you're you're having a unique experience you're having the experience that the disciples wanted to have you're having the experience that they wrote about that Paul wrote about and longed for and John wrote about and different ones and Peter wrote about you're it you're living it you're literally going to be the people the unique people who your Perfection literally will perfect all the saints for 2,000 years prior and bring them out of their graves that's not a small thing sir that's not something little that's large and it looms large Upon Us brother Brandon makes this statement that we read last Sunday where he said this leayer to see in church age is the grandest of of all the church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity sister Don I just realized that was you God bless you happy to have you tonight this must be your family God bless you so he says this layer to see and age is the grandest of all the ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity he said and then in contradistinction he says and then it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than there's ever been yeah amen and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any age and that this was in' 63 think of what it is now think of what your children are facing I'm going to tell you something parents you can ill afford to not have a home where prayers are prayed where the word of God is shared where the token is on display it's the only thing Satan will fear he doesn't care how right you are in your Doctrine on now he does not care he's not afraid of that he does not care how religious you are he does not care how right you are in your Doctrine he because he has a secret he knows that if you miss that life you won't come up anyway and he'll win in the end see so so we find that it's the greatest sinful age many manytimes more he says uh than in any age uh harder to fight against than it was in any age it's so deceiving this is the great age of deception when Christ said so the two Spirits would be so close in the last days till it would deceive the very elected if it was possible see remember Christ spoke of an elected people for the last day Christ did I'm not here telling you there's an elected people for the last last day Jesus said that see so he says but now watch that he's he's dealing with the spirit that Jesus warned that there would be an elected people and we know that because of his statement that the two Spirits the and and they're vastly different right versus wrong Christ versus Satan you can't get more Polar Opposites than that but now think of the Paradox that they are they are Polar Opposites but yet at the end time very uniquely they come so close that Satan's soul is able to impersonate the true church so close that Jesus said it'll get so close that it would even deceive the elected that's how we know there's elected if it were possible so now we know it's not possible POS but we but we do know it's here and it's now and it's happening in real time and you're it friends and and when the enemy comes in like a flood God raises a standard and that standard has always been his church his body raised up under the power of the inspiration with faith in the word of God and a token on display and that's what causes Devils to howl and faint but Now watch how close this can be and then we're going to look at it in the scriptures because it's an astonishing statement of what he's about to say and if you don't know your Bible it sounds impossible he says here that speaking of what Jesus prophesied there in Matthew's gospel that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible see so remember Christ spoke of an elected people for the last day that it would deceive the very elected if it were POS possible say all right give it to us in brass tax what is this deception give it to us in plain terms thank you for asking it's what a prophet does here it is people and you're going to find out it's actually good people people so live people can live a clean oh yeah holy life not be sinful adulterers drinkers Liars gamblers they can live above that see and he's actually saying they're not sinful they're not adulterers they're not drinkers they're not Liars they're not gamblers they live above that they live a clean holy life and still not with it meaning they don't have the Holy Ghost they're not actually born again now we already know know in case that blows your fuses we already know that the unwise virgin of Matthew 25 who has no oil in her lamp but they but but they have all of those all of that list the Bible shows us that that when in Matthew 25 they're standing before the Judgment the great judgment now we know they're not born again because even though the king calls them righteous and if you go into into the Book of Revelation he actually calls them saints and Saint means Sanctified one so they live these unwise virgin remember don't ever cor try to correlate the unwise Virgin to the Harlot daughters they're not harlots they're virgins under Christ but they're lacking the oil the oil is the Holy Ghost they don't they're not actually bornn again and the pro we know that because that they're standing in Matthew 25 before the great judgment but in St John 5:24 Jesus had already promised uh brother um I'm sorry sister Esther sister Esther uh give me St John 5:24 I thought brother Mark I about to say brother Mark it's definitely not brother Mark amen sister eser St John 52 24 so we we're going to find that St John 5:24 don't read ahead of me we'll read it together but you're going to see that it promises that no person who has passed from Death to life will ever be standing at that great judgment he says here he says verily verily truly truly I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death To Life condemnation another Greek word for that is the Judgment you'll never stand the the the the and I don't have time to teach on it tonight but the Bible is replete with evidence that the the bride or as the Apostle like calling her the elect lady she is seated with Christ on the throne judging the Nations the Angels the the the the populations of the world she's not being judged because her sins went ahead of her to judgment in Christ so that by the time she arrives she's already been judged in Christ found innocent and she has a reserved seat on the throne it what you don't want to be guilty of is letting your sins follow you there see so it becomes very clear that these righteous Saints who are being judged have lived a holy life lived above sin were not adulterers drinkers or gamblers or Liars but yet they were not born again if they had been St John 5:24 guarantees they would not have stood in the Judgment see so it's clear that there that there's more to the New Birth than even a Holiness lifestyle imagine if you're a nominal Christian who doesn't even have that amen I mean Peter taught us in in one of his letters that if the righteous is scarcely saved where will the ungodly stand the foolish virgin are called righteous people if the righteous are scarcely saved where will the ungodly and The Sinner stand see so we already know and we can prove by the Bible that the unwise Virgin with no oil has all of these characteristics of Holiness we already know and we proved by the Bible that the real New Birth is a revelation of Faith given by God to an individual you certainly can't birth yourself again Nicodemus knew that he knew enough to know he couldn't do that and and and so we realize and I want to say it again we know we're going to prove it by the Bible that the real New Birth why is it how is it possible that those unwise virgins who believed on Christ and lived holy lifestyle and lived above sin and didn't drink or smoke or cuss or crous or run around and and have all kinds of vulgarity how is it that they they were trusting in Christ but they weren't born again be you're going to find out that to be born again requires more than just a mental acceptance of Jesus Christ it's got to have something happen in your heart and that's the mercy and grace of God that can do that for you if you'll let him he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches so so we we find then that that we can prove it here that the real New Birth is a revelation of Faith that's given by God to an individual it's God's unmerited favor it's not a Whimsical decision made by a person someone decided to they wanted to go to heaven so they turned over a new Leaf joined a church and became a better person I'm all for you joining a church and becoming a better person The unwise Virgins are better persons but I I'm looking for more than that I'm looking for a body change I'm looking for a token to be on display remember friends it's God's unmar favor say I thought it's free correct which means you can't steal it it has to be given to you John 146 we're going to find out sister Esther John 146 we'll read it together uh I just have one the latter portion of it that I want to concentrate on but we'll give you the whole thing here uh Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth the life watch this no man cometh unto the father but by me that's it you're never going to have peace with God except through Christ be a better person do whatever you want to do but you've got to be born again by the life the indwelling life of Christ no man cometh unto the father but by me so this is the first uh of many pieces of evidence that we're going to look at to show that you can't just decide to be born again right you say well I'll just get to God you can't get to God except through Christ that's it job wanted to get to him job said if I just knew where he lived I'd crawl up on his porch and beat on his door but job there was no way for job to do that so God had to come down and talk to job see so in Luke chapter 10 now watch this I'm going to show you another piece of evidence Luke chapter 10 and we're looking at 21 and I believe um 22 uh 21 to 22 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast what did he do you've hid these things see all right so just just let me stop right there so just hold that uh sister Esther but take it down for for right now so so we're now we're beginning to create a picture to show you that it I'm gonna be born again and go to church and go to heaven first of all you you got to have peace with God and you have no way to do it unless Christ rich in Mercy offers it to you see you say well I I'll just get it on my own you can't because it's been hidden see so so now when we think about Christ in Revelation 2 calling it The Hidden Mana see that's what he called it hidden Mana see Jesus said oh you think Moses gave you that bread he said he didn't he gave you bread but it wasn't the bread you think it was he said because you don't recognize me and I'm actually that bread see and so what what were they refusing they believed Moses law but they're refusing the one Moses wrote about Moses said the Lord will raise up a prophet like me and whoever won't hear him will be destroyed and so and but they came in their traditions and Jesus tried to warn them but you you're sticking with your Traditions you're not seeing the advancement of the light I'm now the light of the world for, 1600 years as Paul would later tell them in the book of Acts 1600 years God winked at that ignorance he allowed the blood of bulls and goats and lambs and turtle does but Paul said but now not anymore Christ has come the Lamb of God has been slain the sacrifice has been made and now he requireth it's not he's not trying to talk you into it he now requireth all men to repent and come to the light of the truth for this hour that's what Paul was saying 1600 years of tradition have been now wiped pushed aside and he will no longer honor that see so we so it should not surprise us when Jesus thanks the Father the Lord of Heaven and Earth that he had hid the things so when he so when this same Jesus is talking to John in Revelation Chapter 2 and he says to the Overcomer I will I will give because the only one who can I'll give the hidden Mana what what hidden Mana that that was hid by my father that nobody can get to unless I give it to him see so so that's why he said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches we're going to come back to our to our scripture there in Luke in a moment but let me just let me just sew this up so so that's why in our text he that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden Mana he that hath an ear so so who is it who is he that hath an ear the answer to that is very easily in verse 12 and to the angel of the church right see write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges so whoever is willing to hear the angel sent to the church that's the ones who have an ear to hear and that's the ones who get the hidden mana and that's the ones who are Overcomers and that's the ones who are born again and that's the ones who go in a body change that's the ones who are seated with him on the throne he said that in other ages there's all kinds of benefits when you're willing to have an ear to hear what the spirit said to the say say what it's what he said to the church it's what he said to the angel for the angel to say to the church you say well I'll just get a revelation myself I'll just believe on Jesus how's that going to work for you when the when the mystery of Christ is hidden and it's only given to the angel how do you how's that going to work how do you plan to get there when you're not accepting the message of the messenger that's sent to the age he's the only one given the hidden Mana amen to the angel singular to the angel singular write these things so he's the only one given the hidden Mana to give to the people so now we come back to Luke 10 all right let's go back with it sister Esther I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him so the very Revelation that you need for the new birth is is the hidden Mana Paul called it a hidden Mystery that's what Paul called it we'll look at that in a second get ready to Let's go to Colossians chapter one sister rester so let's look at what Paul had to say here Paul speaking in Colossians chapter 1 verse 26 very first thing he calls it this is in his very first chapter this is opening volley to the Colossians even the mystery which hath been hid hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints so it's made manifest so it's not just knowledge they had an experience it's not just knowledge it's it was manifest to the Saints this was a living breathing experience of the new birth it wasn't just the adoption of do even true Doctrine it's not just mental Ascent or agreement with correct teaching the devil don't care how right you are in your Doctrine he's not afraid of that at all what he's afraid he's not afraid of Jesus it's the life behind the name Jesus that's what he's afraid of that's what will move him when you say in the name of Jesus the seven sons of ska tried to move him by the name we adure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches and the devil figured okay if they're going to engage me intellectually I'm I'm that's just my game and he comes right back okay Paul I know yeah Jesus I know but I don't know who I don't know who you are who are you and the Bible says those spirit and that man jumped on those seven brothers and beat the tar out of them stripped them naked and sent them running into the night he's not afraid sir of the of Jesus what he's afraid of is that you'll have F AI H Hallelujah that's what he's afraid of and faith is not mental Faith it's a revealed Faith it's a hidden Mana it's a mystery of Christ Christ is the mystery of God revealed revealed see so it's an experience they had verse 27 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory see so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the hope of glory you understand so you've because you've passed from Death to life I I wasn't going to go here tonight but sister Esther let's go to Romans 8:20 and 21 I believe this is just from memory but I believe that's that's where it's at let's take a look at Romans 8:20 and 21 all right we're going to talk about we're talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost being your hope hope of glory you've passed from Death to life all right for the creature yeah here it is for the creature or the creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same and there's that word in hope all right verse 21 because the creature itself creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God so that's why the whole the whole earth is groaning waiting for the adoption of the sons of God because nature knows it's coming back also Hallelujah and so so what what is Paul trying to say to the Roman Church that look that this was the god had this plan and and and and it wasn't that Satan sucker punched God In the Garden of Eden snuck up on on on Elohim and socked him it wasn't that Satan you know got away with one Satan was the king of all puppets and he's still the king of all puppets see he's just a a tool in God's hands and God allowed that fall to take place because how's he ever going to be a redeemer if there's nothing lost and and how's he ever going to be a Healer if there's nothing sick how's he ever going to be a savior if there's nothing to save how's he going to be a champion and Captain and a Buckler and a provider and a presence Hallelujah if if we weren't coming here to to be in war he wouldn't need to be in of those things but I'm glad he is cuz I'm here in war Hallelujah so it's so it was subjected to it you were subjected to it this is why this is why brother Brandon would say and I I never fail at a funeral I just preached a funeral in my chaplaincy service recently to a man for a man I didn't know and I and I always make this statement I said I I always tell them I say I heard an oldtime preacher from way back in the day referring to God's prophet and I say he made an astonishing statement that was going to shock you to hear a preacher make and here's what he said God will never condemn a man for being a sinner sure wait what are you a preacher of the Gospel yeah so God will never condemn a man for being a sinner no God's too just to do that as as brother brandham said God will never condemn a man for being a sinner because the man was born a sinner it's not like he volunteered to do that Paul that's Paul's whole point in Romans 8 he didn't Vol we were subjected to it nature was subjected to it's all the plan of God but verse 21 let me have verse 21 again sister Esther because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption and the Glorious Liberty of the children of God he was always going to bring it back I know I'm born in sin I don't really like that but I am but I'm on my way back he was all he was never going to leave me like this he was always going to take me back to Perfection Hallelujah Christ you the hope of glory so I was always coming back to Perfection Colossians 4:3 let's catch that one real fast you good man this we're hustling through some Bible verses is that all right you love your Bible sir you need to be able to prove it I've said to these young people to tonight brother Jason's proving to you what I've said that you don't need to back up on anything this message is provable in the scriptures there's no other single message more provable even anywhere even close to being pro so we can go scripture to scripture to scripture Colossians 4:3 with all praying also for us that God would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ for which I am also in bonds so Christ is the mystery of God revealed it's a revelation what is the revelation of Christ it's a revelation of the word for your day and I see it do you see it are you glad that you can see it there was nothing you could do to see it it's God rich in Mercy Hallelujah I'm on my way back to Perfection because I have believed on him whom God hath sent that's the works of God how can we do the works of God they asked Jesus believe on him whom God hath sent see he sent Christ into the world and Christ is the word I love that that hillbilly logic my it just stops theologians dead in their tracks there's nothing they can do it they can't get around that he just says he put his name in Christ he put his name in Jesus Jesus said I come in my father's name so he put his name in Christ that's what he was always going to do the Bible prophesied that his name would be called Emmanuel he would his name would be called the Everlasting father amen so he put his name in Christ and according to John he Christ is his word so so there's no way it's it's it's in congruous to imagine that you can have a historical agreement and belief in a man that lived 2,000 years ago walked the shores of Galilee went about doing good that's the Son of God died to save Sinners died to save me that's true that's true that's true it's all true it really happened he was the son of God he did die he God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever would believe in him would not perish that's all true but you cannot separate that man from this book and you can't say I believe in that man but I don't believe everything in this book that's in Congress that doesn't work you'll never find Acceptance in the presence of God by denying even one of his words Romans 9 uh 15 and 16 see so I I've made the statement that it's a revelation of the word that's how the new birth comes I think I've been proving it to you I want to keep going can I it's a revelation of the word it's he that hath an ear let him hear receive the hidden manner receive the mystery of Christ what is it it's Christ in you it's the new birth it's the Holy Ghost it's on display causes you to say Amen to every word see Romans 9:15 to16 let's look at some more for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion you say oh well that's in the Old Testament excuse me we're in the New Testament so then Paul says so then it is not of him that will willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy it is God who reveals the hidden Mana to you or you don't get it it's God who reveals himself as a manifestation in your life or you can't have it see First Peter chapter one amen giving our uh viewer person back there work out 1 Peter chap 1 verse 23 how are we born again glad you ask being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the what by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever is that easy see oh how did I get born again oh I decided to get born again no you didn't you got born again by the word of God see James 118 let's hit James 1118 um of his own will James 1118 wait I'll wait on it might wait on it there we go of his own will begot he us of whose will his not yours his of his own will begot he us with what the word of truth how are you begotten by the word of Truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creature so you're The Offspring of something Eternal you understand you're the off why do you say Amen to the word cuz you're a part of the word why do you love the Lord because you're you're part of the family of God you always were part of the family of God you're you're literally he's literally saying of his own will begot he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creature I Am The Offspring of a of of something that's Eternal the ET there's only one thing Eternal and that's God and there's only that's and that's the word there's only one form of eternal life and that's the Eternal Word you understand you understand see that's the hidden Mana that's the mystery of Christ 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and we will catch verses um sister Esther let's go verses 13 through 15 2 Thessalonians 213 to15 but we yes but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation how how' it come through the sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth I mean how this isn't this isn't rocket science so look at it again but we are bound to give thanks all give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth so so belief of the truth entitles you to the Holy Ghost when it when it's really a revelation and it's a manifestation in your life then you're entitled to every Redemptive blessing that Christ purchased at Calvary wherein to he called you by Our Gospel so he Paul is saying here we until he called you by Our Gospel so why why because from the beginning you were chosen to Salvation by believing the truth and so Paul is simply knowing here that his gospel was the truth that his gospel was as Eternal as God was eternal that's how Paul can so boldly make this statement see wherein to he says but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through the sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth wherein to he called you by Our Gospel see to to to what end to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ therefore he says verse 15 therefore Brethren Stand Fast and hold the Traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or by our epistle so it's Eternal truth so you don't get to change it I'm sorry you you can't 21st centuri eyes the word there's no there's no biblical concept called Truth light than Jesus there's no yeah there's no message light there's no Gospel Light there's no 21st century watered down you can't move the ancient landmarks that because it's an eternal word you're not even going to try to do that if you're born again by the Eternal Word see so you don't get to change it because it's an eternal truth it's an eternal Mana it's a hidden Mana it's a revealed Mana the bread from Heaven all right now last time let's uh let's uh let's have Luke 12:55 we'll just read it right quick we've read this in the previous sessions all I'm that clock is my enemy I'm racing right so I want to stop in six minutes I won't make it but I want to but but I'm going to get close amen so Luke 12 and uh 54-56 so Jesus here is reasoning with these religious leaders of his day and verse 54 and he said also to the people when you see a cloud rise out of the West straightway you say there cometh a shower so it is and when you see the south wind blow you say there will be heat and it cometh to pass see and Jesus now they just passed the test and Jesus is about to call them Hypocrites because he's about to make a very obvious point he says you Hypocrites you can discern we're going to look at that word you can discern the face of the sky and of the Earth but how is it that you do not discern this time you're so good at watching the weather and reading the almanac you're so good at understanding nature but how is it that you got so much wisdom that you can read the face of the sky and the face of the Earth no small feet and yet here is the word made flesh standing in front of you and you don't even know your hour you don't even know that I'm the one Moses spoke of and that to reject me is a death sentence see and so this word discern so they're they're not able to discern the time I'm not going to give you the Greek words nor a lengthy breakdown we're not here for that especially on a Wednesday but it it this word discern that Jesus is using it and there's a several derivatives some synonyms and an antonym that we'll catch so it's it literally comes from a a h it's it's a compound word made up and comes from another Greek word that means tested it means approved it means to try to try something to prove something to discern something to distinguish so you can see that not everything laying here is the same because that's the prevailing amalgamation under Christianity Today under the 21st century we're all Christians we're all the same and you what you do have is you do have them all grouped together Under The Binding of the tears yes they are the same they're all getting Bound for the burning but they're not the same as the wheat that are going to the Garner but the prophecy is that first you bind the tears and that's what's happening now and that's what's going to happen in the tribulation but that's not the gar that's not the wheat headed to the Garner they're not the same I am not among the tears I don't want to be I love righteousness and Holiness I love Faith I love the revealed word around I drink it I eat it I think it I live it Hallelujah see so I'm able to to try it to distinguish it to approve yeah Jesus is saying you can discern the nature but you you approve of that but you you don't approve of what's Happening you you're not able to prove anything it has it has the notion of proving a thing whether it is worthy or not metaphorically to it means to make a trial of or to put to the proof or to examine by implication to examine and judge and this is this is where they were failing because they were in their assessment and in their judgment of him who was the word who was the Prince of Life their final Judgment of him was he is Beelzebub he's the prince of devils and that's how he does these Miracles H you know when when they stood before Pilate and and they said he must be crucified what why I find no fault in he's a blasphemer now they couldn't substantiate that in in the Bible just like critics today they try to substantiate criticism of the message of the hour there's no way to do it in the scriptures right I've challenged them around the world they're a bunch of scared chickens have no interest at all I've tried to even Bait them to my shame I've tried to do I shouldn't do that but but but they they have no answers at all and they won't face me and I've tried to get them to face me and then they write letters some open letter to me went around the world somebody said you know there's an open letter to you I said yes I heard you read it no don't care you know they under they understand I we brother Burley preached uh at our youth camp about three years ago first one was that three years ago and uh he told the eagle story and and showed what we all know about eagles and how you know and how eagles nurture their young and carry them on their wings and and different things like that and brother Brandon was an eye witness of it in the wilderness said I saw that mother she laid her wings out and those little guys got hooked their bill in and she lifted them up with all them went right into that back into the cliff so we know it does it and so you know I had uh some deception team notice and and you know we we want you to uh to correct Burley Williams and I said okay who are you we're the deception team notice okay well who's that well we're not going to tell you well how do I know you're not a 40-year-old living in your grandmother's basement what are your credentials what are your qualifications who are you tell me who you are send me your credentials so that I know that are you a zoologist are you know I'm I'm and I was trying to I was trying to actually I said I'll be happy to look at any evidence you have send me your evidence and send me your citations and your credentials I understand what a what a a proper credential paper and how it's received or not received and I said I'm happy to take a look at it just tell me who you are I'd like to know who I'm talking to I'd like to know that you're not just a stupid teenager and the you know playing video games criticizing me and I said I'd like to know who you are well we're not going to tell you well then I as soon as you give me your credentials and tell me who you are then I'll give you my evidence that B that brly Williams was correct and they they keep writing me letters for three years and I just keep sending the same one send me who you are send me your credentials so that I can know who you are and you're not an idiot and and this has been going on they just wrote me recently again and they just get the short answer silence that's the most one debie said just give them silence people hate that they do man they do wow women are good I mean they're not never mind so sorry sweetheart so so we we find that that and and I went on and they don't know it but I and I'm a researcher it's what I do and I went on I went to the Smithsonian I went to zoology websites I have I have long lengthy quote quotes from the Smithsonian I have men who have been world renowned uh the people who who do that kind of thing who watch birds and uh it's not just a birer but they're actually like a scientist of it and and they've been in the Amazon and they've been in the rainforest and they've they've observed the Western and the the Southern Hemisphere and they've went all over the world observing Eagles and they absolutely do what brother Burley said and absolutely do what William brandham said but I'm not going to I'm not going to s it to them I've got a whole a whole PDF Pages thick with with citations ready to go all they got to do is tell me who they are and they won't so I won't I have no plans to and they they can they can send me emails till the cows come home and the as how's brother Gerald H say till the cows come home and the calvs cry for buttermilk they won't get an answer from me although I've got a big big answer for them so so it it comes down now to proving something to examine it by implication to examine and to judge something and it refers to the Book of Malachi in chapter 3 now that's very interesting to me because there's almost no other book in the Bible if you go back and you read through Malachi chapter 1 uh chapter 2 chapter 3 I mean place after place after place after place the people have have a have a difficult time judging God and you'll you'll find this language more there than anywhere else in the Bible and God will say you know where wherein you have said such and such and such and such about me and it's not even true right well and they'll say well you've did this and God was God's in a discourse with these people well you have said this and this and that but I'm here to say this this and the other and the whole book is about people who cannot deserve turn the mind of God and God is saying and and and I should probably turn and and read one of my favorite passages there but I'll just I'll paraphrase it for you they they you know that's the one where you know God says how will you why will you rob God on tithes and offerings you know that that's we're familiar with that and they say huh how have we robbed God what are you talking about I ain't robbed God and he said you don't pay your tithes and offerings you're robbing God you see the disconnect you see that disc connect between the people and and he says you you say you're a holy righteous people yeah we are what what's the problem well why is it that you tell all the Sinners it's okay God loves you anyway and you can just act like that and you'll still get to go to heaven and God took exception to that he didn't like them telling people that he told he was going to destroy him for it you can read it in the Book of Malachi go home and read it it's just four four short chapters and so constantly constantly they're they're they're misjudging God it means it it's a synonym of a Greek word to discern as Jesus was saying means to investigate and it usually means judicially as a as an antonym it uses a Greek word which means to reject as the result of examination and disapproval to do away with what has been laid down to make void to nullify to disan to deny to renounce to reject and we've got plenty of that that they misjudge the word of God and misjudge what God has done in this day and disallow it and reject it and feel fine doing it good luck with that I'm here to tell you I my faith is stronger today than it's ever been so in Luke 12 Jesus foretells of a fatal flaw in their comprehension that would ultimately Doom them that that's the sad part of it ultimately this isn't some small thing if you don't hear what the spirit is saying to the churches it's going to Doom you and so you know they they would they would literally falsely judge Christ from envy and they would crucify him and then you know what happens then you see the same devil because then in the book of Acts they turn their murderous Envy onto his disciples and they and they say oh you know this this this Holy Ghost and this rushing Mighty Wind they don't even realize that God sent that wind to help them he sent that wind to give them another chance to give them the Holy Ghost and and some of them believed it Peter preached to them and said you crucified him oh what must we do it's okay breathe calm down because the Bible says in David he won't leave his soul in hell so it's all good he rose from the dead don't worry you killed him but he rose the Lord rose him and now all you got to do is repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you can receive the same Holy Ghost I have I'm here to tell you tonight I don't care what your life has been in the past you can repent you can be baptized you can receive the Holy Ghost and you have the same experience I have the same experience Paul had so they failed to realize that they could they could discern the times and the seasons that they were in but spiritually they're blind see they they were not they were not able to access anything of Eternal value to say nothing of responding correctly to it and Jesus warned them Jesus actually warned them I'm coming to a close five minutes Jesus warned them there won't be one stone left upon another that doesn't get thrown down and by the time they caught the Revelation it was too late Titus was already storming the Gates of Jerusalem you know where they ran you know what history tells us they ran into the temple the very Place Jesus said would be flattened they ran into the very thing thinking that if they went into church God would save them what they did not know that the Old Testament Prophet had told them Ezekiel is the shakina left that Temple a long time ago and he's not coming back until the Millennium he's gone he's not in there and they ran in there and that's the very thing that Armageddon is going to produce people running to what they believe is salvation and they even say peace and safety and then cometh sudden destruction they thought God would save them he left that Temple a long time ago I I said this to a brother in the back office and I was going to save it for part five we'll get to part five but just the Holy Spirit anointing me just to say it tonight the greatest problem in the ranks of the message is not misunderstood Doctrine the great that's a problem that's not the greatest problem that's a problem but that's not the greatest one the greatest problem in the ranks of the message is not misunderstood Doctrine the greatest problem in the ranks of the message and always has been in every age is people living among the ranks of the Born Again In varying degrees of sanctification but not having the literal token life itself that is has always been the greatest problem in every age like but it's people who who sit in the ranks of the born again and they themselves are not born again and they just live in varying degrees of sanctification and they're they do not have the literal Life of Christ itself are you or or are you not willing to come with the unleavened bread of sincerity preach this Sunday the reason that it's so important as the unleavened bread means it's not mixed Christ was the unleavened bread the Passover he was the unleavened bread he was the first fruits understand those first three Feast from Leviticus 23 refer to Christ Earthly Ministry the fourth feast Feast is the Jubilee the Feast of Pentecost and that runs all the way through the Gentile age all the way to the Rapture and then the fifth Feast sixth Feast seventh Feast is all to Israel the seventh Feast we find in the is in the millenum and so the question becomes tonight are you or are you not willing do you hear the voice in the East Wind the East Wind of judgement that is coming to this world young people think seriously now because it's not coming it's here we're almost home bow your heads with me let me just hold the musicians at their seats for just a moment give them an opportunity with all heads bowed are you or are you not willing to come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth are you or are you not willing to cast down from your mind from your mind and from your life the old leaven of malice and wickedness that's what Paul wrote to the Corinthian Church that when you come to the Lord don't come with the old leaven of malice and wickedness but come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth are you willing or are you not you want to cast down from your mind and from your life the old leaven of malice and wickedness are you willing or are you not are you willing to come God's provided way of hidden manner you're willing to come God's provided way why don't you raise a hand to him right now some already have to say Lord I want to come the way of the word I and and and if you're willing tonight to say preacher I've too long held on to a life that that's the old leev of malice and wickedness and I don't want that life anymore raise up your hand so God can see it I don't want that anymore in my life God bless you friends hands up all over the building I hope that you're willing tonight having had it proved to you out of the Bible what we're preaching I went I took my time and I I feel burdened in my heart because that we are facing the East Wind it's upon us friends the world is falling apart young people you've been hearing it and hearing it and hearing it you must have the token you must have the Holy Spirit it must be on display in your life you must come say well I shout he said you might and you might not will I dance you might and you might not but will I speak in tongues you might and you might not but one thing you will do you will come subject to every word of God how many want those dynamics that refill of the Holy Spirit oh lord god let's stand to our feet brother Anthony bring your team let's stand to our feet friends and let's let's sing a song uh brother Tony on Sunday um you were singing that song You Deserve The Glory I'd like to sing some more of that tonight amen praise the Lord do you love the Lord let's bow our heads father we thank you for this word tonight Lord I Thank you for honest hearts and honest hands that sat here Lord and took a journey Lord that's what we did tonight we went on a journey through the pages of your word it it it if if a preacher's going to make some of these statements if a prophet's going to make that astonishing statement it's got to be provable in the Bible Lord and so we wanted tonight to come unabashedly without any second guessing or hesitation we wanted to be able B to demonstrate from the Bible that what we believe is the truth Lord it it when you can believe it like that it'll produce the Life of Christ every time when you can say Amen to every word of God in your life then you're that entitles you to the Token in this hour what the token is in this hour Lord we know is much more than it was in the ages because that was a dip and this is the fullness the token always it's always corresponds to the level of of the word of the revelation of the word for the age and we have come back to the full token it's not something new it's we've returned back to the original that's what that early church had they had the token they had the abstract title deed they had the full Jubilee Lord they had it they had the ministry of the son of man they had the office in operation of the son of man they were the word made flesh they were Mrs Jesus of that day and now father you have come full circle at the end of the seventh age you've brought it all back around and you've restored it back to its original Lord I stand tonight such a failure so often Lord in my life I can't even explain it to me the failures I have much less try to explain it to you you but Lord I stand here before these people tonight and I confess that I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ it is the power of God unto salvation and I'm a Believer Lord and I pray that you will help us tonight Lord to bring our lives subject to every word of God bring our homes
