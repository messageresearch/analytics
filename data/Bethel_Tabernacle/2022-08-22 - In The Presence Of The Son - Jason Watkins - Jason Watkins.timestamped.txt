[37:06] read the 11 verses that are there
[37:09] it's extremely familiar to us
[37:12] but i have a purpose in doing it
[37:15] and um i believe a purpose the lord is
[37:18] behind
[37:19] and i want to take today a title
[37:22] in the presence of the sun s-o-n in the
[37:26] presence of the sun
[37:28] and as a subtitle i'm taking
[37:30] a rational look
[37:32] at revelation chapter 10. now that's not
[37:36] the
[37:37] whole of my sermon and
[37:40] it was going to be the main body of my
[37:42] sermon but i don't always get to choose
[37:44] that
[37:45] so we're going to have to go over it
[37:47] quickly and get to the real burden on my
[37:50] heart today say well why why not just
[37:52] jump to that well because i i feel led
[37:55] to do it this way amen there's a number
[37:57] of things that we want to say
[38:00] uh that are really the the burden of our
[38:02] heart hence the title in the presence of
[38:05] the son you'll see why
[38:07] just in a few minutes in fact as i'll
[38:09] tip you off now
[38:10] where brother branham talks about that
[38:12] that's where we are is laying in the
[38:15] presence of the son amen and so from
[38:18] that i want to take in the presence of
[38:20] the son and that's my real burden
[38:23] but to really
[38:24] have it be effective
[38:26] i we we want to look and establish some
[38:30] things that we know uh probably would
[38:33] take the first 15-20 minutes and just go
[38:35] over things that we know but i want to
[38:37] go over it slowly and i'll go over it
[38:39] rationally and uh and i just want to get
[38:42] you thinking would that be all right
[38:44] amen i want to put your minds in gear in
[38:47] the scriptures today revelation chapter
[38:50] 10
[38:53] we'll begin verse 1.
[38:56] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[38:58] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[39:00] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[39:04] was as it were the sun
[39:06] and his fetus pillars of fire
[39:09] being a bible student and teaching
[39:11] on these kinds of things i always want
[39:13] to go down rabbit trails but i'm not
[39:15] going to do that we've got to just get
[39:17] right through this
[39:18] and verse 2 and he's and he had in his
[39:21] hand a little book open
[39:23] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[39:25] and his left foot on the earth and cried
[39:28] with a loud voice as when a lion roareth
[39:31] and when he had cried seven thunders
[39:33] uttered their voices
[39:35] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[39:38] their voices
[39:39] i was about to write and i heard a voice
[39:42] from heaven saying unto me seal up those
[39:44] things which the seven thunders uttered
[39:47] and write them not
[39:48] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[39:51] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[39:53] hand to heaven and square by him that
[39:55] liveth forever and ever who created
[39:57] heaven and the things that therein are
[40:00] and the earth and the things that
[40:02] therein are and the sea
[40:05] and the things which are therein
[40:07] that there should be
[40:08] time no longer
[40:10] but in the days of the voice of the
[40:12] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[40:15] sound the mystery of god should be
[40:17] finished as he hath declared
[40:20] to his servants the prophets
[40:22] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[40:25] spake unto me again and said
[40:28] go and take the little book which is
[40:30] open in the hand of the angel which
[40:34] standeth upon the sea and upon the earth
[40:37] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[40:40] him give me the little book and he said
[40:43] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[40:46] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[40:48] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i
[40:51] took the little book out of the angel's
[40:53] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[40:55] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i
[40:57] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[41:00] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[41:02] before many peoples and nations and
[41:05] tongues and kings
[41:07] let's pray father we commit ourselves
[41:09] into your hands having read your word
[41:12] now lord
[41:13] master
[41:15] laying underneath my bible on purpose
[41:17] are pillowcases father that were sent to
[41:20] me
[41:21] by a sister who
[41:22] has a friend lord with cancer in in her
[41:26] brain and she asks specifically would
[41:29] you have my pillowcases prayed over so
[41:32] lord
[41:34] while we are ministering the word
[41:37] oh master anoint them father according
[41:40] to the book of acts in may when she lays
[41:43] her head upon these pillowcases may the
[41:45] enemy get scared and run for it lord may
[41:48] she be well for your glory in the name
[41:51] of jesus christ we commit it to you
[41:54] in jesus name amen
[41:56] god bless you friends you can be seated
[42:09] so if you will please this morning give
[42:12] me your undivided attention and i will
[42:14] try to go as quickly as i can
[42:17] i have a mountain of material to cover
[42:20] and uh i i'm a lot of different quotes i
[42:23] want to put up on a powerpoint and i'd
[42:26] very much like to get to all of it today
[42:28] and so you just be a little patient you
[42:31] know i'm not a long-winded preacher so
[42:34] i'll go quick uh so if you don't pay
[42:36] attention you'll get lost in the shuffle
[42:38] amen and so um
[42:40] we want to go studiously uh forward so
[42:43] we found out
[42:44] um last time and i'm not continuing my
[42:48] series i i feel like we found the
[42:51] stopping point to take that
[42:53] series on the seven vowels of revelation
[42:56] but one of the last points that we were
[42:58] making that is in turn relevant to what
[43:01] i want to say today
[43:03] is we found out that god sends forth his
[43:05] word
[43:06] to those who were in the mind of god
[43:09] before the foundation of the world and
[43:11] those people run towards it
[43:15] you remember that
[43:17] now you were shouting at the end of the
[43:18] last service when we said that so you
[43:20] run towards the light amen as a believer
[43:23] you run towards it and and that has been
[43:27] in every age it doesn't matter when the
[43:29] word uh for the age comes uh to them we
[43:33] found out that like mary when they hear
[43:36] the prophecy and they hear that they are
[43:39] a part of it they just say amen
[43:42] and as we've said to you before
[43:44] that's really all a believer
[43:46] is capable of saying when they're
[43:49] confronted with the word of god i i i
[43:52] challenge any believer to try to say
[43:54] otherwise than amen even if you have to
[43:57] say amen oh me amen oh my amen help me
[44:00] lord but there's something inside of a
[44:03] believer that will not let you deny
[44:07] the word of god
[44:10] and as we've said then also
[44:14] we find that as soon as
[44:16] a believer believes god's word
[44:19] then god is incapable of doing anything
[44:22] other than bringing it to pass
[44:25] it you're a man
[44:27] your belief in the word since he made
[44:30] the promise and you believe it then you
[44:33] took him at his word now he takes you at
[44:36] your word and then what does he do he
[44:38] brings it to pass
[44:39] and so we find that it's quite
[44:41] unstoppable and that's a real big point
[44:44] that you want to absorb today because it
[44:47] doesn't matter you know we said last
[44:49] time as we were closing out there are
[44:52] 200 million
[44:54] demons as brother matt was preaching on
[44:57] wednesday they're not headed to to the
[45:00] jews anymore the hitler's gone
[45:01] eichmann's gone stalin's gone where they
[45:04] have now turned their attention to is
[45:07] the elect lady to the bride of jesus
[45:09] christ but it doesn't matter if there's
[45:11] 200 million 400 million 900 million
[45:16] a hundred hundred million a billion
[45:18] nothing can stop you believing god's
[45:21] word and god bringing it to pass in your
[45:24] life
[45:26] it is quite unstoppable
[45:28] the word made flesh
[45:31] is happening and there are not enough
[45:34] power not enough demons in all of hell
[45:37] to prevent it i take comfort in that i
[45:39] don't know about you but that just fills
[45:41] me with courage today because i realize
[45:44] that even i can't stop it say why are
[45:46] you worried about you because i'm my
[45:48] greatest enemy
[45:50] but but when i know that my greatest
[45:51] enemy can't even stop it that it will
[45:54] bring even my greatest enemy subject to
[45:56] the word of god
[45:58] then you can imagine why i'm quick to
[46:01] say amen amen
[46:06] we find that in the marriage of the lamb
[46:08] and i don't have this one if you just
[46:10] leave that screen right there
[46:12] we find that in the marriage of the lamb
[46:15] uh brother joe carter sent me this weeks
[46:18] ago and i held on to it because it's
[46:20] meant a lot to me
[46:22] brother branham says israel was promised
[46:24] a promised land
[46:25] but they had to fight for every inch of
[46:28] it now i hope you're ready to be a
[46:30] fighter today if you want your
[46:32] inheritance you're going to have to
[46:34] fight for it because the devil's not
[46:35] going to surrender it just willingly see
[46:38] and so so if he's on your property today
[46:41] he will have to be thrown off
[46:44] all right
[46:46] and so this is the age where god is
[46:48] calling for champions who are ready to
[46:51] take the promise of god storm the gates
[46:54] of the enemy overthrow his works and
[46:56] take the land
[46:58] say why should we do that because we own
[47:00] it it's ours by inheritance
[47:05] brother branham said they were promised
[47:06] the lamb had to fight for every inch of
[47:08] it what wherever the souls of your foot
[47:10] treads upon that have i given you
[47:14] god said to joshua
[47:18] it was all there
[47:21] which means
[47:22] everything is in the place you got to
[47:25] fight
[47:26] there's nothing on this side of the not
[47:28] fighting
[47:29] everything is in the fighting side all
[47:32] right so it's all there the land was
[47:34] there and god gave it to them but they
[47:37] must fight for it the same way
[47:40] it is about divine healing and you're
[47:41] going to see here in a minute it doesn't
[47:43] matter what i mean the word of god has
[47:45] helped all your flesh so whether it's
[47:47] your mind or your body
[47:49] or your
[47:50] soul amen
[47:52] see
[47:53] uh it the the the say it's all you're
[47:56] going to have to fight brother branham
[47:57] says it's the same way about divine
[48:00] healing god watch this now god has got
[48:03] the power to heal you if you've got the
[48:07] courage to accept it
[48:10] now how many champions we got in here
[48:12] today say i have the courage oh my oh i
[48:16] want to say to that sister have courage
[48:18] today because god has the power to heal
[48:22] you to fix you and i i often need fixed
[48:26] i don't know about you but i'm all the
[48:28] time meeting fixed and repaired and i
[48:31] know he has the power but you've got to
[48:33] have the courage to accept it and but
[48:35] you'll fight every inch of the way
[48:38] that's a pretty devastating statement
[48:40] every inch
[48:42] every inch
[48:44] see
[48:46] god all right god has got amazing grace
[48:50] to save you
[48:51] and
[48:52] two things he will do it he will do it
[48:55] because you can't do it and
[48:57] not only he will do it but he will do it
[49:02] god has amazing grace to save you and he
[49:05] will do it but you'll have to fight
[49:08] every inch of your way
[49:11] hallelujah how many are saved by the
[49:13] blood of the lord jesus christ you're
[49:15] born again of the spirit of god you're
[49:17] looking to make heaven your home
[49:20] amen you're looking for a rapture
[49:22] you're looking for a body change you're
[49:24] ready to get out of this old pest house
[49:27] ready to say trouble's over well i'm
[49:29] here to tell you you better be a
[49:30] champion today because you're going to
[49:32] have to fight
[49:35] and if you don't have the courage to
[49:37] fight
[49:37] you're going to be a real big
[49:39] underachiever
[49:40] brother branham says i've been behind
[49:42] the pulpit going on 31 years
[49:45] this was in uh 1962.
[49:49] i've been behind the pool but going on
[49:50] 31 years and every inch of it has been a
[49:52] fight constantly it certainly has
[49:55] but we must fight if we must reign
[49:58] so we find out that the bride
[50:01] has to make herself ready all right now
[50:03] i'm going to get get ready to tell you
[50:05] how to fight because i'm not here to
[50:08] just you know amp you up in a fighting
[50:11] spirit
[50:13] all right i'm here to tell you that the
[50:15] only way you're going to be successful
[50:17] as a fighter is you're going to have to
[50:18] surrender
[50:22] what kind of army is this
[50:26] so we find out that the bride now he's
[50:29] just been finished saying you're gonna
[50:31] have to fight for every inch
[50:34] so we find out that the bride has to
[50:36] make herself ready
[50:39] is that the bible the bride hath made
[50:42] herself ready
[50:43] see so but i thought jesus saved me he's
[50:45] got power to save you he's got power to
[50:47] heal you but you've got to have the
[50:48] courage to accept it see
[50:50] and then when you're going to accept it
[50:52] then you're going to have to be ready to
[50:54] fight and your be your first your first
[50:57] your first training in fight school is
[50:59] to surrender
[51:02] be willing
[51:03] to lay aside every weight
[51:06] that does so easily beset us that we
[51:09] might run with patience the race that is
[51:11] set before us
[51:13] we must lay them aside ourself
[51:18] we must lay our self aside ourself
[51:23] all right
[51:24] we can't say god
[51:26] you come and lay them aside for us
[51:30] we got to do that everybody say ourself
[51:35] we got to do that ourselves see
[51:39] so we find then that this is the age
[51:42] that we have come to
[51:44] so whether in whatever way you're
[51:47] defending the gospel whatever way that
[51:50] that you are uh living a testimony
[51:52] whatever way that whatever victory that
[51:55] you hope to have in your life in your
[51:57] marriage in your family in your children
[52:00] it's going to have to take courage a
[52:03] willingness to fight and fighting your
[52:06] first fighting technique is to get you
[52:09] out of the way so the first enemy you
[52:11] gotta wipe out is
[52:17] that's the first guy's got to go
[52:21] no need to claim great promises of god
[52:24] and i'm here to tell you something
[52:25] friends now
[52:26] i i believe me as many quotes as i've
[52:29] got i want to look at i
[52:31] left off a ton and so i left off so many
[52:34] our this this is slide 43 i'm starting
[52:38] from so
[52:39] 42 of them i spared you
[52:42] okay
[52:43] so we spared you 40 the first 42. and i
[52:47] and i i'm not sure how many are behind
[52:48] this not that many but not 42 but but
[52:52] but no matter what we're when we start
[52:54] to look at these things and we we're
[52:57] moving into this territory a lot of the
[52:59] ones that i spared you
[53:01] are brother branham and i'll just give
[53:02] you the theme of all 42 of them that
[53:05] there's promises
[53:07] that the church ought to be experiencing
[53:10] in the last day
[53:12] and brother branham's concern
[53:14] when he's preaching
[53:16] to the to the pentecostal
[53:19] movement
[53:20] to the remnants of what was left of the
[53:22] azusa revival it all denominated and
[53:25] fractured and split apart and all this
[53:26] kind of stuff and they had allowed sin
[53:29] and the bars were lowered and now all
[53:31] kinds of things were going on that were
[53:32] not allowed in the early days and
[53:34] brother branham is trying to show them
[53:37] that you started out with all kinds of
[53:39] power you were healing the sick and you
[53:42] were raising the dead and people were
[53:44] getting the holy ghost and i don't just
[53:46] mean they joined a church they actually
[53:48] got born again
[53:50] teenagers were born again old people
[53:52] were born again didn't matter how old
[53:54] they were they could be born again and
[53:56] brother branham says now look at you now
[53:59] you're all split up and powerless
[54:02] say yeah but that was to them but
[54:03] brother branham is those principles
[54:06] still apply to us
[54:08] and those same principles brother
[54:09] branham said we ought to be way further
[54:12] up the road and he goes all the way into
[54:15] 1965 saying that
[54:17] that we ought to be seeing the dead
[54:19] raised among us we ought to be seeing
[54:20] the days of ananias and sapphira we
[54:23] ought to see devils put to flight we
[54:25] ought to see the holy ghost and the
[54:26] token on display what's wrong
[54:31] why don't we
[54:33] what hinders it you say well we do see
[54:35] some miracles you're right we do
[54:37] but why would i why would i be
[54:40] if
[54:41] you know i i realized that
[54:44] that it that jesus said you know some
[54:46] will be 30 some 60 some 100
[54:49] okay so fine
[54:51] so i'm not i'm not ever gonna maybe i'm
[54:53] not okay i'm not a prophet of the age
[54:57] okay i'm not a dispensational messenger
[55:00] okay so maybe i'm not a hundred and and
[55:03] maybe i'm not even a sixty say maybe
[55:05] you're only a 30. okay then let me be a
[55:08] hundred percent of a 30.
[55:10] what i don't want to do is come up in 18
[55:13] or 22 if i'm supposed to be at 30 if i'm
[55:16] supposed to be a 50 i don't want to be a
[55:18] 41.
[55:19] hallelujah i want to i want to have
[55:21] everything that god has for me
[55:24] so i if i want to maximize everything in
[55:27] our that that is promised of god then
[55:30] there's a way it takes a champion to do
[55:32] it you've got to have a champion's heart
[55:34] you've got to be willing to fight you've
[55:36] got to be willing to eliminate you from
[55:38] the equation as long as you're in the
[55:40] equation you'll never reach your 30 or
[55:43] you're 40 or you're 50 or 60 or 80 or 90
[55:45] or whatever you whatever god has
[55:47] ordained for you to be
[55:50] that's one way of looking at that
[55:51] parable that's not the only way you
[55:53] could extrapolate it in a different way
[55:54] i'm perfectly aware of that just for
[55:56] purposes of example today
[56:00] so we realize that we've got to do that
[56:04] ourselves
[56:06] these promises are ours
[56:09] the the i'm going to tell you something
[56:11] friends the the gifts of the spirit
[56:13] belong to you
[56:15] divine healing belongs to you
[56:18] amen hallelujah the the the the not only
[56:22] you know the the gifts but the virtues
[56:25] of christ
[56:26] of faith and virtue and meekness and
[56:28] temperance these things belong to you
[56:30] because you've been born again of the
[56:32] spirit of god now your old flesh can't
[56:34] hold you back anymore unless you let him
[56:38] see and so it's about putting him under
[56:41] under the under your feet first and
[56:43] foremost and then that way god can move
[56:46] in your life and you can be an overcomer
[56:48] and a victor and that's what god is
[56:49] looking for in this day
[56:51] he says unto the angel of the church we
[56:53] didn't read it today but under the angel
[56:55] of the church of the laodiceans write
[56:57] these things saith the amen the faithful
[56:59] and true witness and it's a fair
[57:01] question
[57:02] you know this book of revelation because
[57:05] and we have to connect chapter 3 to our
[57:07] text of chapter 10
[57:09] because chapter 3 holds the seventh
[57:11] angel and you see him again in chapter
[57:13] ten
[57:14] same same exact angel earthly messenger
[57:18] so if it's if it's given unto this last
[57:21] day messenger
[57:23] uh that he's he's written to this
[57:26] particular angel
[57:28] and his message is what i'm about to say
[57:31] to you uh you know what these things
[57:33] sayeth the amen the faithful and true
[57:36] witness now that's christ
[57:39] so then it begs the question why was
[57:41] this addressed
[57:43] to a single messenger i mean
[57:46] what he's going to hear
[57:48] is of monumental importance
[57:52] i mean it has it has titanic
[57:54] implications to the world
[57:57] what what what is promised and what god
[58:00] is because i mean this is the seventh
[58:02] age where they're putting christ out of
[58:05] the church
[58:06] now they're basically eliminating
[58:08] themselves from going in a rapture i'd
[58:10] say that's pretty huge
[58:13] i'd say that's headline
[58:15] the church worldwide by putting christ
[58:18] out because they put the word out
[58:21] they have eliminated themselves from
[58:23] going in the rapture
[58:25] and so you're not going to get a bigger
[58:27] story than that and so so what what is
[58:30] the message from the messenger i counsel
[58:33] of thee
[58:34] by of me i sav that your eyes may see in
[58:38] gold tried in the fire
[58:40] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[58:42] appear these are promises that god has
[58:46] given the earth that if you'll just
[58:47] follow the word then you'll find
[58:50] redemption
[58:52] and so why was this addressed to a
[58:54] single messenger i think the obvious
[58:56] answer is because he was the only one
[58:57] capable of receiving it
[59:00] if you read the bible
[59:02] because it's it's it had to be
[59:05] an earthly messenger at the end time
[59:07] because he's going to book in the ages
[59:09] with the prophet so it has to be
[59:11] naturally then it follows bible teaching
[59:13] that the
[59:15] that the angel the seventh messenger of
[59:17] revelation 10 7
[59:19] is also going to have to be a prophet
[59:22] because that's how god brings his word
[59:24] to the earth he's always done that down
[59:26] through the bible and can can i just say
[59:29] to you here today
[59:31] that that that is not
[59:33] a new
[59:34] truth
[59:36] that is a restored truth
[59:39] that's not a new truth people say oh you
[59:42] believe in the prophet you had that said
[59:43] lord come with a message that's not a
[59:45] new truth that's simply a restored truth
[59:47] he's always done it that way
[59:51] see
[59:52] so he'd say well we got good preachers
[59:54] aaron was the great priesthood but god
[59:56] couldn't allow aaron to call joshua to
[59:59] the tabernacle of the congregation in
[1:00:00] the book of deuteronomy moses had to do
[1:00:02] that why because moses was a prophet a
[1:00:04] prophet had to call joshua on the scene
[1:00:07] that matters
[1:00:09] that matters
[1:00:12] see it's very obvious then in the bible
[1:00:16] of course that the angel of revelation 3
[1:00:18] 14 is the same angel seen in revelation
[1:00:20] 10 7. i don't really see how someone
[1:00:23] could miss that
[1:00:24] you know
[1:00:25] could miss that the that the mighty
[1:00:27] angel of revelation 10 1 you know he's
[1:00:30] going to give these mysteries of the
[1:00:32] kingdom to this strong angel uh who then
[1:00:35] who who then is going to bring it to the
[1:00:38] to the family of god because
[1:00:40] and and then if you if you'll notice
[1:00:42] that he hears a voice from heaven now
[1:00:44] that's the same thing in revelation 18 4
[1:00:47] that he heard a voice from heaven saying
[1:00:49] come out of her my people
[1:00:51] that's the messenger of the earthly
[1:00:52] angel
[1:00:53] come out of her my people and and and
[1:00:56] then when he's standing there receiving
[1:00:57] these mysteries
[1:00:59] john hears a voice saying now go ask the
[1:01:01] angel with his foot on the land on the
[1:01:03] sea and that's christ say well he
[1:01:04] doesn't go ask the seventh angel for the
[1:01:07] book that that's that's how the world
[1:01:10] misses it because they isolate a
[1:01:12] scripture right there and say see it
[1:01:14] couldn't have been that way but if you
[1:01:15] go back through the bible from genesis
[1:01:18] to revelation god always uses a
[1:01:21] messenger a prophet
[1:01:24] he doesn't come and and direct lip to
[1:01:26] ear with his family he uses a prophet
[1:01:29] and and the voice that's in that
[1:01:30] prophet's message is the voice of christ
[1:01:33] it's not they're not the man
[1:01:35] you understand it's not the man william
[1:01:37] branham was a man like me born in sin
[1:01:40] had to be born again of the spirit of
[1:01:42] god had his ups and downs like i got
[1:01:44] like you got like elijah had but it's
[1:01:46] the position that he holds in the
[1:01:48] scripture
[1:01:49] otherwise if he doesn't it has no life
[1:01:52] but i but as i eat it i get life so i
[1:01:54] know it must be true
[1:02:03] so
[1:02:04] the narrative makes it pretty clear that
[1:02:09] that john you know he
[1:02:11] he's got to have some
[1:02:13] some intermediary that
[1:02:15] that he can
[1:02:16] commune with it's got to be a a person
[1:02:19] it's got to be that's why an earthly
[1:02:20] angel is a man
[1:02:22] see and so
[1:02:23] so we find out that it's got to be
[1:02:25] someone god had to send the kind of a
[1:02:27] messenger
[1:02:28] that was that was kin to us
[1:02:31] as humans that someone who could
[1:02:32] instruct us how to uh partake of the
[1:02:36] open book of life and i'll tell you
[1:02:38] something friends you know
[1:02:40] as a student of the of the scripture
[1:02:41] just since a young boy
[1:02:43] i you know i feel the bible makes such
[1:02:45] an overwhelming case that this is none
[1:02:48] other than
[1:02:50] the elijah of malachi 4.
[1:02:53] i as a student i can't possibly miss
[1:02:56] that
[1:02:57] it's too plain and you know i mean as a
[1:03:00] lover and as a student of history
[1:03:02] especially correlating world history to
[1:03:04] bible prophecy you know a history of the
[1:03:07] 20th century
[1:03:09] really leaves no doubt in my mind that
[1:03:11] this prophecy lived itself out in the
[1:03:14] ministry life and ministry of william
[1:03:15] branham
[1:03:17] i'm just saying that as a historian as i
[1:03:19] look at history and i look at modern
[1:03:22] events and they're made clear to me in
[1:03:23] prophecy and i look at that ministry
[1:03:26] it has to be because there's not even
[1:03:28] another one even mildly remotely even
[1:03:31] close
[1:03:33] see
[1:03:34] so people can people can say what they
[1:03:36] want but i think that logic uh is
[1:03:39] certainly on my side
[1:03:41] see
[1:03:42] i mean my goodness
[1:03:43] how how blind would someone have to be
[1:03:47] so once the understanding then of
[1:03:49] revelation 10 uh the 10th chapter
[1:03:51] becomes clear to you
[1:03:54] and as such
[1:03:55] you must conclude that this ministry
[1:03:58] would then
[1:04:00] be the only authoritative voice
[1:04:03] in the earth for a rapture
[1:04:05] now i'm only using logic
[1:04:07] i'm only connecting dots i'm not making
[1:04:10] some big sweeping claims that i'm not
[1:04:12] laying the groundwork for i mean all
[1:04:14] we're doing is looking at the bible and
[1:04:16] we're putting it all together and it
[1:04:17] draws a picture
[1:04:18] see so hence this is a rational look at
[1:04:22] revelation chapter 10.
[1:04:24] and i'm only bring brief overview i
[1:04:26] promise you i could spend days just just
[1:04:28] teaching out of that one chapter
[1:04:30] and so so we find that
[1:04:33] that sense it would be the ministry of
[1:04:35] christ again
[1:04:37] in the ministry of the son of man now
[1:04:39] remember
[1:04:41] the son of man means working through
[1:04:43] flesh prophetically all right and so
[1:04:45] therefore it would it would facilitate
[1:04:48] the voice of the resurrection that's
[1:04:49] that's how it's going to come to us
[1:04:51] which is going to be the voice of christ
[1:04:53] that's why we say
[1:04:54] the elijah of this day brother branham
[1:04:56] said it the elijah of this day is the
[1:04:58] lord jesus christ
[1:05:00] see but god but christ comes working
[1:05:02] through his prophets do you you know i
[1:05:05] love the balance of that i love the fact
[1:05:07] that i can say he was a an ordinary man
[1:05:10] like me but he held a special office
[1:05:12] that god could step in and speak to us
[1:05:15] and yet it's the voice of a man he
[1:05:17] didn't save me i don't get baptized in
[1:05:19] his name i don't pray to him he's my
[1:05:22] brother
[1:05:23] but yet i can put my soul in the soul of
[1:05:26] everybody i love based on that voice and
[1:05:28] say that voice will get you home
[1:05:34] i don't know why people get out of
[1:05:36] balance on that to me it's the simplest
[1:05:37] thing in the world it's beautiful
[1:05:41] so
[1:05:42] so you know that the end time voice
[1:05:44] would end up being the voice that god
[1:05:46] would use then
[1:05:48] to also indict the generation for the
[1:05:50] this generation for the second
[1:05:52] crucifixion
[1:05:53] and as we've said the ominous words
[1:05:56] to you before according brother branham
[1:05:59] i do this
[1:06:00] in the presence of the judge
[1:06:02] so this ain't no joke
[1:06:05] the indictment was serious business
[1:06:08] i'm here to tell you the supreme court
[1:06:10] of heaven
[1:06:11] it was on their docket that day it was
[1:06:13] on god's docket that day
[1:06:15] and he had a prophet and god comes down
[1:06:17] to
[1:06:18] oversee the trial and he has a prophet
[1:06:21] standing there and says i
[1:06:23] indict this generation for the second
[1:06:25] crucifixion of the lord jesus christ as
[1:06:28] calling him your husband
[1:06:30] and you have been an adulterous woman
[1:06:32] adulterating the word of god and not
[1:06:34] believing it and and he wasn't he wasn't
[1:06:36] saying the people because you haven't
[1:06:38] believed i'm a prophet believed i'm the
[1:06:39] messenger he was saying because you have
[1:06:41] denied the very scriptures that you
[1:06:43] claim to be following
[1:06:46] hallelujah you see discernment you call
[1:06:48] it telepathy you you you you sis the
[1:06:51] sick healed and you said oh it's
[1:06:52] witchcraft oh it's all kinds of things
[1:06:54] the days of miracles is past and false
[1:06:56] baptisms and false godheads and you have
[1:06:59] denied and god has came down and proved
[1:07:01] it
[1:07:03] no wonder the indictment was legit
[1:07:07] now
[1:07:08] so logically
[1:07:11] then then then it then it should stand
[1:07:14] that all dissenting voices
[1:07:17] would have to be deemed illegitimate
[1:07:20] would have to be
[1:07:22] because this prophet has the authority
[1:07:24] of the scripture
[1:07:26] and he had he holds a position granted
[1:07:28] to him by god and so any dissenting
[1:07:30] voice then has to be deemed illegitimate
[1:07:32] it has to be see because this earthly
[1:07:35] angel having received the open book
[1:07:38] given into his hand by the mighty angel
[1:07:40] of revelation 10 1 which again is christ
[1:07:42] see
[1:07:43] because christ is the only one worthy to
[1:07:45] claim the book of life amen christ is
[1:07:47] the only he's the only one the book of
[1:07:49] light he's the only one who can open it
[1:07:50] who can take it who can claim it who can
[1:07:52] reveal it
[1:07:53] he's the only one who can give you life
[1:07:55] he's the only one who can redeem you
[1:07:58] see
[1:08:00] so this is god's provided way to
[1:08:02] redemption by the blood
[1:08:04] i mean that should make sense to you
[1:08:06] i mean you have no access to the
[1:08:09] physical blood
[1:08:10] so how's the blood going to save you
[1:08:12] you can't even get it
[1:08:14] you don't even know where in the world
[1:08:15] you can go to get it
[1:08:17] i don't have it don't come to my house
[1:08:19] the vatican don't have it
[1:08:21] it's not in israel
[1:08:23] the chemistry went down the cross and
[1:08:24] hit the earth and claimed the earth
[1:08:26] you understand but brother branham said
[1:08:28] but it's the life that's why jesus said
[1:08:30] this is my blood in the new testament
[1:08:33] it's the life coming it and it's your
[1:08:35] and how does the life come by a revealed
[1:08:37] word
[1:08:38] how do you get the life by believing the
[1:08:40] revealed word
[1:08:41] it's a revelation god gives it to you
[1:08:43] you accept it you believe it you're a
[1:08:45] seed gene of god comes to life and
[1:08:47] you're a new creation in christ
[1:08:50] and now the blood has been applied to
[1:08:52] you because you
[1:08:54] found it through the bleeding word oh my
[1:08:59] how how beautiful i mean it took a god
[1:09:02] to put that together
[1:09:07] i mean i mean the veins of jesus
[1:09:10] would have only held enough blood
[1:09:12] for a number of people yeah
[1:09:15] well you couldn't have painted every
[1:09:16] human being that would ever live with if
[1:09:18] you had all of his blood drained out of
[1:09:20] him in a paintbrush i couldn't cover i
[1:09:22] couldn't cover the current world in in
[1:09:25] that
[1:09:26] see so how are you going to do it so you
[1:09:28] have no physical access to the blood of
[1:09:30] christ so it's the life in the word is
[1:09:32] acquired by faith in the revealed word
[1:09:35] of your hour entitling you to a token
[1:09:38] and a new birth experience
[1:09:40] that this is a rational look
[1:09:43] at revelation 10.
[1:09:48] it's not a new truth
[1:09:50] it's a restored truth
[1:09:53] but brother m says in the literacy in
[1:09:54] church age god will confound them all
[1:09:56] this is the last quote i'll read that's
[1:09:58] not on my slides
[1:10:00] god will confound them all meaning the
[1:10:03] church world yes sir
[1:10:05] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[1:10:08] of god
[1:10:09] pardon my voice
[1:10:10] it is its own mouthpiece so god is
[1:10:13] turning on her
[1:10:14] he will confound her through the prophet
[1:10:17] and the bride for the voice of god will
[1:10:19] be in her see yes it is for it says in
[1:10:22] the last chapter of revelation verse 17
[1:10:25] the spirit and the bride say come
[1:10:28] once more the world will hear direct
[1:10:30] from god as at pentecost the original
[1:10:32] one
[1:10:33] but of course of course of course
[1:10:37] of course
[1:10:38] that word bride will be repudiated
[1:10:42] as she was in the first age
[1:10:44] they didn't believe
[1:10:46] that she was the bride they didn't
[1:10:48] believe jesus was the son of god
[1:10:50] see so it stands to reason oh friends
[1:10:54] the value of knowing how to find favor
[1:10:56] with god in these kinds of times
[1:10:58] in this day there don't undervalue
[1:11:01] god revealing himself to you in his word
[1:11:05] oh don't take it for granted whatever
[1:11:08] you do i'm tell you something friends a
[1:11:10] lot of times as ministers
[1:11:12] we we be we and there's a quote i may
[1:11:14] get to it i'm not sure my time is
[1:11:17] burning up quickly
[1:11:19] but
[1:11:20] we find that
[1:11:22] you know this word
[1:11:24] has the ability to
[1:11:25] inspire faith and and healing
[1:11:28] and deliverance
[1:11:30] but you know sometimes a point needs to
[1:11:32] be made because a lot of times when
[1:11:33] we're when we're speaking on those kinds
[1:11:36] of things
[1:11:38] then everyone wants you know the fishes
[1:11:41] and the loaves
[1:11:43] but then when the word starts telling
[1:11:44] men how they should act and think and
[1:11:46] look and move and do
[1:11:48] and it starts telling women how they
[1:11:50] should act and look and think and move
[1:11:51] and do how where how they should dress
[1:11:53] how they should conduct themselves men
[1:11:55] the same way
[1:11:57] i mean it's so personal it's so personal
[1:12:00] that brother branham says to a man you
[1:12:02] talking about invading somebody's space
[1:12:05] he says get them bangs out of your
[1:12:08] face
[1:12:09] that's pretty flat
[1:12:11] that's that's a lot of audacity who's
[1:12:13] this kentuckian think he is i mean
[1:12:15] he's going to tell me how to comb my
[1:12:17] hair yep
[1:12:19] he's going to tell women he's going to
[1:12:21] talk about you know shorts and
[1:12:24] shorts on a woman say
[1:12:26] understand this and please hear me out
[1:12:28] don't throw something at me shorts on a
[1:12:30] woman are not ungodly
[1:12:32] under her skirt
[1:12:34] shorts are her underneath garment
[1:12:38] that's historically accurate
[1:12:40] not only i don't say that because
[1:12:41] william branham said that i study
[1:12:42] history that's historically accurate
[1:12:45] shorts were her underneath brother ram
[1:12:47] says at all times shorts are a woman's
[1:12:48] underneath garment no wonder a man is a
[1:12:50] city when he puts him on
[1:12:52] your pants don't come all the way down
[1:12:54] what's wrong with you
[1:12:58] what happened to you you want it you
[1:12:59] want to know the history just in the
[1:13:01] turn of the first turn of the 20th
[1:13:03] century just no longer ago than that it
[1:13:05] would have been unthinkable for a grown
[1:13:06] man to wear shorts in public you know
[1:13:07] who did that boys
[1:13:10] boys hysteria historically boys did that
[1:13:13] you know how you know who the first one
[1:13:14] to bust that the head of the boy scouts
[1:13:17] of america
[1:13:19] he come out and said oh you know it's
[1:13:21] part of a uniform and
[1:13:23] but but
[1:13:24] historically speaking no further back
[1:13:26] than just 1910 1911 1912 no further back
[1:13:30] than that
[1:13:31] that
[1:13:32] boys wore shorts because they were
[1:13:34] immature men
[1:13:36] they were boys
[1:13:37] and a and a and a and they they waited
[1:13:40] you're talking about waiting on a
[1:13:42] birthday
[1:13:43] boys watch the calendar and measure
[1:13:45] their height on a wall waiting for the
[1:13:48] day when they get to go out in public in
[1:13:51] pants
[1:13:53] it was a huge thing
[1:13:55] it was like his it was like his his
[1:13:58] crossing over i'm no longer a boy i got
[1:14:00] pants on
[1:14:01] [Music]
[1:14:03] mama said i could wear pants today
[1:14:07] see
[1:14:07] so you can imagine why brother branham
[1:14:09] would say and you know women would come
[1:14:11] to brother branham and say oh brother
[1:14:14] branham i don't wear shorts i wear
[1:14:16] slacks brother branham said that's worse
[1:14:22] because britches are a man's garment and
[1:14:25] that's an abomination to god it means
[1:14:28] it's nasty it stinks it's filthy it's
[1:14:30] vile
[1:14:32] shorts are not indecent under her
[1:14:34] garments that's her underneath garment
[1:14:36] so worn outside then she's indecent
[1:14:39] she's got an adultery spirit on her
[1:14:41] because men look at her and lust to have
[1:14:43] her because she's walking around outside
[1:14:46] with her in underneath clothes on the
[1:14:47] outside
[1:14:49] and she's exposing her nakedness so it's
[1:14:50] just okay i'll go put on pants no that's
[1:14:52] worse
[1:14:54] that's you'd be better to be indecent
[1:14:57] because wearing pants is an abomination
[1:15:00] to god
[1:15:01] and and and and listen
[1:15:05] women come to william branham they come
[1:15:07] to me they come to william branham it's
[1:15:08] i'm no different
[1:15:10] they called paul a woman hater because
[1:15:12] he said they shouldn't do this and
[1:15:13] shouldn't do that and they come to
[1:15:15] brother brandon they come to me they'll
[1:15:16] come to you these preachers in here have
[1:15:18] to brother jd sat in
[1:15:20] in turkey one time or egypt somewhere
[1:15:22] and just trying to go over these
[1:15:23] fundamentals of the scripture and women
[1:15:25] in the back you know are laughing
[1:15:29] and brother jason where was it jay's
[1:15:31] turkey or egypt in egypt
[1:15:34] and brother jason
[1:15:35] he didn't get mad he didn't blow us he
[1:15:37] didn't blow a stack he just he just
[1:15:39] cautioned him he said you know he said
[1:15:41] all i'm doing is reading the bible to
[1:15:43] you
[1:15:44] i'm telling you what the scripture says
[1:15:45] he said i wouldn't want to be the person
[1:15:48] on the day of judgment who has found and
[1:15:50] have a replay that you said and heard
[1:15:53] the bible read and you laughed at it
[1:15:56] you know what those women quit laughing
[1:15:57] immediately
[1:16:00] and you can you can you can get mad as
[1:16:03] you want to but this is what a prophet
[1:16:05] taught
[1:16:06] and and and women came to him and said
[1:16:09] oh well my preacher
[1:16:11] said it doesn't matter
[1:16:14] and william branham said one of the most
[1:16:15] terrifying statements i've ever heard in
[1:16:17] my life it sends chills every time i
[1:16:19] hear it he just said quickly he'll
[1:16:21] suffer for it in the regions beyond
[1:16:24] my preacher said it doesn't matter he'll
[1:16:26] suffer for it in the regions beyond
[1:16:28] now if the man who told you that is
[1:16:30] going to suffer where's it going to put
[1:16:31] you lady
[1:16:32] where are you going to be sister when
[1:16:34] you when you when you wear and dress
[1:16:36] indecently and put on garments
[1:16:38] pertaining to a man and call yourself a
[1:16:40] christian brother branham said you're
[1:16:42] not even a lady
[1:16:45] not even a lady would do that right
[1:16:48] see so now you can see why friends this
[1:16:52] age calls for champions
[1:16:54] it's not calling for wimpy people men
[1:16:57] men or women this is calling for people
[1:16:59] who are brave
[1:17:00] people who got courage people who say i
[1:17:03] will take the way with the lord's
[1:17:04] despised few
[1:17:06] i will change my life and change my
[1:17:08] wardrobe and change my i'll change a
[1:17:11] career i'll change a career path i'll do
[1:17:13] whatever i got to do i'll give away
[1:17:16] everything i just gotta have christ
[1:17:18] [Applause]
[1:17:20] because that's the secret to bringing
[1:17:22] the power of all these promises back
[1:17:25] into the church when we wanna see the
[1:17:27] dead raised and we wanna see the power
[1:17:29] of god move and we want to see the days
[1:17:31] of ananias and sapphira
[1:17:34] amen
[1:17:35] amen
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:44] i may not get to that
[1:17:46] but i'm
[1:17:47] i'm in
[1:17:48] it's okay
[1:17:50] it's okay don't worry
[1:17:53] i don't close without permission ever
[1:17:55] ever ever ever i never step away from
[1:17:57] this pulpit without permission
[1:17:58] so you just don't worry about that you
[1:18:00] let me deal with that amen
[1:18:05] so there's a value
[1:18:08] in knowing how to find favor with god
[1:18:11] in this maddening age
[1:18:13] of insanity
[1:18:17] the problem comes in our hearts
[1:18:20] the sin in the hearts of people
[1:18:23] you know
[1:18:24] let me tell you something friends the
[1:18:26] only thing
[1:18:27] you say brother jason you you overvalue
[1:18:30] this message
[1:18:32] well
[1:18:34] can i just take you back to a story in
[1:18:36] the bible
[1:18:37] that should be familiar to you since
[1:18:38] your days of sunday school
[1:18:40] the only thing that kept tamar alive
[1:18:44] was the things that judah provided her
[1:18:46] with
[1:18:47] his ring and his staff
[1:18:50] and it was a it was a a mischievous
[1:18:52] underhanded thing that she did and judah
[1:18:54] was somewhere he shouldn't have been i
[1:18:56] get that's that should give us all
[1:18:58] courage that if something out of
[1:18:59] something like that
[1:19:00] an adulterous affair you know
[1:19:03] addressing and acting like a hooker and
[1:19:05] playing the part of it and judah taking
[1:19:07] that i mean and yet that and yet and yet
[1:19:11] it became the line of christ
[1:19:14] now you say would jesus be associated
[1:19:16] with that thank god yes
[1:19:19] thank god there's hope for us all no
[1:19:21] matter how vile we've ever been
[1:19:23] no matter where you are today he he can
[1:19:25] put you in his favor today
[1:19:28] he can erase all your sins and all your
[1:19:31] past and all your mistakes and
[1:19:33] completely throw him in his forgiveness
[1:19:35] and even god can't remember it
[1:19:38] oh i just say hallelujah
[1:19:41] glory to god that's the kind of god i
[1:19:43] want to serve and if believing this word
[1:19:45] gets me to that god then let me believe
[1:19:47] every line every verse every word about
[1:19:50] it don't let me deny or argue with any
[1:19:53] of it
[1:19:56] it was the only thing that kept tamar
[1:19:58] alive
[1:19:59] otherwise she would have been burnt
[1:20:02] but she pulled out a ring and a staff
[1:20:05] she said the man who gave me these
[1:20:08] and when they looked as judas
[1:20:11] and judas judah said
[1:20:12] she's been more righteous than i have
[1:20:17] the only thing keeping you from the
[1:20:18] tribulation
[1:20:21] was bound up under seven seals amen
[1:20:24] the only because the tribulation wasn't
[1:20:26] going to come in the first second third
[1:20:28] fourth fifth sixth age
[1:20:30] it was going to come in the seventh age
[1:20:32] and when you read we we read it in the
[1:20:34] book of revelation
[1:20:36] that that that the book was sealed in
[1:20:39] the time of john's writing
[1:20:41] he sealed it up why because the church
[1:20:43] had backslid it was going off paul had
[1:20:45] died paul had went home now john's the
[1:20:47] last one he's on an island of patmos as
[1:20:48] a prisoner
[1:20:50] and he gets this great revelation
[1:20:52] and it comes that's why you don't find
[1:20:54] qual paul or any of them quoting from
[1:20:55] the book of revelation they're already
[1:20:56] gone the church is already
[1:20:59] trending to
[1:21:01] to uh failure
[1:21:03] and it gets sealed up and it stays
[1:21:05] sealed and instead of christ being able
[1:21:06] to come and
[1:21:07] take a bride home he must now sit back
[1:21:10] down in the eternities and intercede for
[1:21:11] her ignorance because he can't lose her
[1:21:14] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:21:16] seventh angel i'm gonna unseal it all
[1:21:18] back again i'm gonna bring back the
[1:21:20] original word because i've got to have
[1:21:22] that original alpha bride back i'm
[1:21:25] talking about before she started
[1:21:26] descending in into idolatry he's got
[1:21:29] because she was supposed to go on to a
[1:21:30] rapture she couldn't she fell so now we
[1:21:33] have been restored back and now we're
[1:21:35] carrying on to a rapture and our
[1:21:37] obedience to the word that they failed
[1:21:40] to keep is what will bring them out of
[1:21:42] the depth out of the grave it'll bring
[1:21:44] every age imperfection from the grave
[1:21:48] that's a big deal
[1:21:51] that ain't no light thing
[1:21:54] a message come and a bride's believing
[1:21:56] it she's not just believing it mentally
[1:21:58] she's becoming it
[1:22:01] that's the evidence she believes that's
[1:22:02] the evidence it's a revelation is that
[1:22:04] it's actually becoming her life
[1:22:07] and the word is not just written here
[1:22:10] but it's written behind skin
[1:22:13] because brother man said once the books
[1:22:14] are closed for the last time then the
[1:22:16] word will be flesh
[1:22:18] see so
[1:22:21] so we find that it's the only thing
[1:22:25] people don't want it
[1:22:27] people
[1:22:28] deride it and reject it
[1:22:31] they attack it
[1:22:33] talking about disingenuous attacking
[1:22:36] something that you know makes good
[1:22:37] people and good lives and good families
[1:22:39] i mean if you don't believe it why in
[1:22:40] the world you attack that
[1:22:42] that's just crazy
[1:22:45] it calls for decency and holiness and
[1:22:47] honesty and integrity and responsibility
[1:22:49] and
[1:22:50] reliability and and and and
[1:22:53] righteousness and
[1:22:54] i mean good grief what's there to attack
[1:22:58] see
[1:22:59] and so
[1:23:01] so we find that it is the the thing
[1:23:03] that's keeping us out of the tribulation
[1:23:05] period
[1:23:06] it's the only thing that keeps us from
[1:23:08] idolatry
[1:23:10] and crucifying jesus the second time
[1:23:14] if it wasn't for this message and god
[1:23:15] revealing it to you
[1:23:17] you would be right there with the other
[1:23:19] crucifiers
[1:23:20] you'd be right there with them
[1:23:23] see don't those weren't all bad people
[1:23:25] they they were devout jews when they
[1:23:27] came in there peter was preaching to
[1:23:28] devout men
[1:23:30] devout jews they weren't hooligans and
[1:23:32] whoremongers they were devout jews and
[1:23:34] peter said you with wicked hands and
[1:23:36] determined counsel crucified the lord of
[1:23:38] glory
[1:23:41] so so we're not we're not saying they're
[1:23:42] horrible people we're not i'm not i'm
[1:23:44] not judging people today i'm just saying
[1:23:46] god has sent a word that is mercy to the
[1:23:49] world
[1:23:50] and and we find out that it is the very
[1:23:52] thing keeping us from crucifying christ
[1:23:54] the second time
[1:23:56] because you know why because you know
[1:23:57] why because the idolatry is in their
[1:24:01] hearts
[1:24:03] that's the real key
[1:24:05] that's the real purpose
[1:24:08] of a spiritual new birth
[1:24:11] amen
[1:24:12] you understand that god has to change
[1:24:14] the nature because the idolatry is in
[1:24:18] people's hearts so he sent i will send
[1:24:20] unto you elijah the prophet before the
[1:24:23] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[1:24:25] the lord and he shall turn the hearts
[1:24:28] see
[1:24:29] what is keeping where's what's the
[1:24:31] idolatry it's i mean it's not i'm we're
[1:24:34] we're not suggesting that that these
[1:24:36] denominations and countless thousands of
[1:24:38] independents are going home and praying
[1:24:40] to idols catholics do that
[1:24:42] i'm not saying protestants do that they
[1:24:44] came out of that under luther's
[1:24:45] reformation that that's not the kind of
[1:24:47] idolatry it is it's it's it's the only
[1:24:50] reason that catholics
[1:24:52] pray and have idolatry with statues
[1:24:56] is because their heart is unconverted
[1:24:58] the only and and you say well the
[1:25:00] protestants don't do that the
[1:25:01] protestants have different kinds of gods
[1:25:03] they they
[1:25:04] bow to
[1:25:05] and
[1:25:06] ungodliness and and cares of the world
[1:25:09] and riches
[1:25:10] and that becomes their god
[1:25:13] and they forsake brother branham goes
[1:25:15] into i think satan's eden
[1:25:17] or god of this evil age i don't remember
[1:25:19] one of those barn burners
[1:25:23] and he says
[1:25:25] oh they say that they love the lord
[1:25:27] jesus says but they they don't they love
[1:25:31] satan
[1:25:33] and he says their life proves they love
[1:25:36] satan they hate christ because they say
[1:25:39] they love him but they hate him because
[1:25:40] they hate his word
[1:25:42] and and satan has somehow got them to
[1:25:44] divorce
[1:25:45] christ from his word
[1:25:47] and he's made them two different things
[1:25:49] so and there's an advantage in doing
[1:25:51] that satan's not a dummy if he can get
[1:25:54] people to separate that
[1:25:56] then they can they can deny this while
[1:25:58] still believing the historical man
[1:26:02] i believe that historical man 2000 years
[1:26:04] ago well but here's what his word oh no
[1:26:06] no no but i believe him
[1:26:09] and then satan was successful and that's
[1:26:11] why william branham one of the simplest
[1:26:13] things he kept telling them is he said
[1:26:14] christ is his word and you can't
[1:26:17] separate him you can't separate the
[1:26:19] message from the messenger
[1:26:21] and the messenger in the latter reign is
[1:26:23] the lord jesus christ see
[1:26:26] and so we find that the idolatry is in
[1:26:28] people's hearts hear me today hear me
[1:26:30] today friends because and and and then
[1:26:33] you you look at what they do they heap
[1:26:34] to themselves teachers
[1:26:37] who will tell them those things are okay
[1:26:41] teachers having itching ears as i've
[1:26:42] said to you twice already i'll say a
[1:26:44] third time today if you somehow were
[1:26:46] asleep at the switch when i said it the
[1:26:48] first two times that if you are
[1:26:50] unconverted then the bible says your
[1:26:53] natural mind is enmity against god it
[1:26:55] can never believe god it won't it can
[1:26:57] never agree with him it has to die
[1:27:00] that old nature has to die
[1:27:02] that if you don't get a new birth then
[1:27:05] you will hunt around you'll leave the
[1:27:07] message and you'll hunt all over the
[1:27:09] world until you find the version of the
[1:27:12] gospel that you want to be true
[1:27:14] and you'll stick with that when there's
[1:27:16] a teacher who'll tell you this is the
[1:27:17] one
[1:27:20] but when you're born again that stuff's
[1:27:22] barnyard nonsense you can't even touch
[1:27:23] it you gotta have eagle food after that
[1:27:26] see
[1:27:28] so you know the
[1:27:30] the the big building and
[1:27:32] money grabbing
[1:27:34] uh ministry that's not the idolatry
[1:27:39] that's just a consequence like brother m
[1:27:41] said lying cheating gambling adultery he
[1:27:44] said that's not sin that's just a
[1:27:46] consequence it's an attribute
[1:27:48] it's a byproduct of unbelief you're not
[1:27:50] born again you're not converted so
[1:27:52] that's why you do those things see
[1:27:54] and so so we find that the that in the
[1:27:57] same way the big building schemes and
[1:27:59] money grabbing ministry that's not the
[1:28:01] idolatry the idolatry is in their heart
[1:28:04] just like lot's wife
[1:28:07] just like lot's wife she she fled i mean
[1:28:10] she packed up and fled her cosmopolitan
[1:28:12] city
[1:28:14] she believed the message
[1:28:17] she believed those messengers it's gonna
[1:28:19] the world's coming to an end and she ran
[1:28:21] for it with her husband she left that
[1:28:24] city we left all of her social standing
[1:28:27] and and her fashionable lifestyle and
[1:28:30] yet she perished uh still for looking
[1:28:33] with a longing to go back
[1:28:35] see
[1:28:36] so she came out with lot
[1:28:39] but the problem was
[1:28:41] she had all she left sodom but sodom
[1:28:45] wasn't really the problem she had
[1:28:46] already allowed satan to build a
[1:28:48] metropolis in her heart
[1:28:52] in her heart
[1:28:54] so so what did she left a city but it
[1:28:57] was in her heart
[1:28:59] this this this metropolis was in her
[1:29:01] heart and it was everything to her
[1:29:04] so much so that she turned with longing
[1:29:07] eyes knowing it was doomed
[1:29:09] knowing the sentence of god was upon it
[1:29:11] and she longed to go back there you're
[1:29:12] talking about madness
[1:29:15] and people when you when you stay
[1:29:16] unconverted when you have not allowed
[1:29:20] when you have not allowed the lord god
[1:29:22] to come in and change your heart and
[1:29:24] make you into a new creation in christ
[1:29:25] jesus you might walk away from the bar
[1:29:28] rooms but you'll still long for them you
[1:29:30] might walk you might walk away ladies
[1:29:32] you might walk away from your britches
[1:29:34] you'll long for them still you you men
[1:29:36] you might you might you might walk away
[1:29:38] from beer and walk away from fast living
[1:29:40] and walk away from lusting but i'll tell
[1:29:42] you something if that metropolis is
[1:29:44] still in your heart you'll look right
[1:29:46] back longing to go there you might be
[1:29:47] too afraid to go there but eventually
[1:29:50] it's going to be your undoing
[1:29:53] satan knows how to get you he plays the
[1:29:55] long game he's not worried that you come
[1:29:57] into church and get all excited and get
[1:29:59] all enthused he's not worried that you
[1:30:01] he doesn't care how religious you are he
[1:30:03] doesn't care
[1:30:04] he's not afraid of the fact that some of
[1:30:06] you have been born and raised in this
[1:30:08] message you think he's afraid of that he
[1:30:09] wasn't even afraid of jesus
[1:30:13] he doesn't care how religious you are he
[1:30:14] doesn't care even how right you are in
[1:30:17] your doctrine what he's trying to
[1:30:20] prevent is your heart to be changed he
[1:30:22] knows it that if you can if you miss
[1:30:24] that life you won't come up anyway and
[1:30:26] that's what he's trying to keep you from
[1:30:28] i just say today this age calls for
[1:30:30] champions how many champions are in the
[1:30:33] building today
[1:30:35] to say i will not go down with this
[1:30:37] burning ship i'm going to take the way
[1:30:39] with christ i'm going to run to calvary
[1:30:41] i'm going to put my arms around the
[1:30:43] cross
[1:30:44] hallelujah
[1:30:46] oh my how about we all acknowledge we're
[1:30:49] in a fight today
[1:30:51] how about we all acknowledge how about
[1:30:52] we all acknowledge that we're all in
[1:30:54] this thing together
[1:30:55] oh what a contrast to this age you gotta
[1:30:58] you gotta a dying world headed to death
[1:31:01] and you and and and you got a living
[1:31:03] bride headed to life i'd say that's a
[1:31:05] pretty big contrast
[1:31:07] oh my humanity
[1:31:10] humanity going all in on laodicea
[1:31:14] and a bride coming all out
[1:31:17] i'm all out
[1:31:20] how many with me
[1:31:21] i'm all out
[1:31:23] i'm all out i don't i don't care for
[1:31:26] this world's vain riches
[1:31:28] because i know it's a siren song it
[1:31:30] leads to a it's a death trap
[1:31:32] it's a death trap you can't change
[1:31:34] yourself
[1:31:35] it's so pointless to even all you're
[1:31:37] doing is fighting an uphill battle
[1:31:38] you'll finally tire out and tumble back
[1:31:40] down the hill again anyway
[1:31:42] why don't you just surrender your life
[1:31:44] and to say lord jesus today
[1:31:47] i've heard
[1:31:48] all i got to hear i came to church and i
[1:31:50] heard a rational look at the revelation
[1:31:53] chapter 10 and maybe today i see it in a
[1:31:55] different light maybe today i see my
[1:31:57] error maybe today i understand a little
[1:31:59] more why i have never had the kind of
[1:32:02] overcoming power that i see in the bible
[1:32:04] and i i hear of the promises of god and
[1:32:06] i i see what they did in the book of
[1:32:08] acts and i want that kind of life and
[1:32:10] today i've heard about how i can get it
[1:32:12] today are you here today as that person
[1:32:15] in this building today
[1:32:17] to say that's the life that i want
[1:32:19] that's the life that i crave
[1:32:21] that's the life that i'm willing to
[1:32:23] stake everything upon today
[1:32:28] see we know
[1:32:30] that we're not looking
[1:32:33] i'm gonna i'm gonna close here in just a
[1:32:35] few minutes
[1:32:37] we
[1:32:38] know that we're not looking
[1:32:42] for
[1:32:42] another revival
[1:32:45] as as i mean we always want revival but
[1:32:48] i'm talking about a revival to the age
[1:32:51] the last revival has happened the
[1:32:53] opening of the seals for the gentiles
[1:32:55] but there is another revival but it's to
[1:32:57] israel
[1:32:58] not to you and me
[1:33:00] there is another one coming but that's
[1:33:02] to israel under moses and elijah we'll
[1:33:03] be gone
[1:33:05] and we we showed you that that because
[1:33:08] grace is
[1:33:10] grace is the encampment of the redeemed
[1:33:12] once the gentile bride once the queen
[1:33:14] leaves
[1:33:15] to heaven then grace is taken from the
[1:33:17] earth it left with her
[1:33:19] see
[1:33:20] and so for the gentiles there's no more
[1:33:22] grace and there's no more mercy and yet
[1:33:24] brother branham said
[1:33:25] they'll they'll keep coming to church
[1:33:29] they'll they'll keep coming to the altar
[1:33:32] they'll keep repenting
[1:33:34] thinking they're getting saved
[1:33:37] say well who in the world that's a ton
[1:33:39] of audacity who does william branham all
[1:33:41] he's doing is teaching the scriptures
[1:33:44] that's why he that's filthy will be
[1:33:45] filthy still
[1:33:47] and we find that that that's why friends
[1:33:50] that that god comes down into our lives
[1:33:53] and
[1:33:54] and sometimes we
[1:33:56] we we have to find ourselves in a spot
[1:33:59] where god is just
[1:34:01] not going to accept any more excuses
[1:34:04] amen
[1:34:05] he's not going to accept any more
[1:34:07] excuses
[1:34:08] he's going to call you and say now
[1:34:11] i i've waited long enough and you're
[1:34:13] going to surrender
[1:34:14] or else
[1:34:16] and that's the love of god amen
[1:34:19] see you say the judgments of god
[1:34:21] remember remember remember the bible
[1:34:25] judgments of god on his children are not
[1:34:28] penalty
[1:34:30] it's impossible because brother brown
[1:34:32] says and i have it on on the slide we'll
[1:34:34] get to it next time brother brown says
[1:34:36] at calvary god made me
[1:34:40] pay
[1:34:41] for all my sins
[1:34:44] in him
[1:34:46] he suffered the penalty
[1:34:48] so judgments that come upon our lives as
[1:34:51] children of god are not a penalty
[1:34:54] they're sent to invoke repentance
[1:34:57] the only time you don't find that
[1:34:58] changed until revelation 17 and
[1:35:00] tribulation when judgments are coming
[1:35:03] and now it's not to invoke repentance
[1:35:05] because nobody can repent
[1:35:07] mercy's over
[1:35:08] you understand it's not coming for
[1:35:09] repentance then it's coming for penalty
[1:35:11] it's coming for judgment
[1:35:13] right now
[1:35:14] god comes down into our lives and and
[1:35:16] and sometimes we we go under the
[1:35:19] severity of the loving hand of god
[1:35:22] and i'm here to tell you friends just
[1:35:24] remember
[1:35:25] it's there for repentance
[1:35:29] and you might be here today
[1:35:32] and you might be just
[1:35:34] smelling pretty and right as rain and
[1:35:35] all the world is good
[1:35:37] and everything's coming up roses and so
[1:35:40] i don't really feel the need uh to make
[1:35:42] all these changes you're talking about
[1:35:44] i'm pretty happy with my life
[1:35:46] in sin i'm pretty happy with my
[1:35:48] carnality
[1:35:49] no you won't be
[1:35:52] you won't be
[1:35:54] if you're a child of god you mark it
[1:35:56] down now that brother jason told you
[1:35:59] on this date in history
[1:36:01] you won't be
[1:36:03] because he's not going to lose even one
[1:36:07] and he will do whatever he's got to do
[1:36:09] by any means necessary you say you
[1:36:13] shouldn't threaten that is not a threat
[1:36:15] when i say that to myself i say
[1:36:18] thank god
[1:36:19] he'll do whatever is necessary what if i
[1:36:22] get out of line he'll use any means he
[1:36:24] doesn't matter and i just say yes lord
[1:36:27] yes lord pour it on lord don't let me
[1:36:29] stray
[1:36:30] don't let me stray if i can't if i don't
[1:36:32] got the strength to overcome it then you
[1:36:34] knock me down do what you got to do
[1:36:36] but i want to be pleasing that's that
[1:36:39] sounds crazy but that's my love for
[1:36:42] almighty god that's my love for his life
[1:36:44] that's my love i don't want to be wrong
[1:36:48] and and and sometimes i'm weak but i
[1:36:50] know that when i'm weak he's strong
[1:36:54] there's ever there's many people in here
[1:36:56] today i'd say the better part of this
[1:36:58] congregation

[1:37:13] teenagers in here who ain't hardly old
