just last minute so take your time getting that amen amen we've read this many times i'm sure but i'd just like to read it here tonight for our opening text let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there may you be also whether i go you know not and the way you know thomas saith in him lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way jesus said unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me first thessalonians 4 one more scripture before you have you take your seats first thessalonians 4 13. but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are sleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an ark of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be called up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words heavenly father we thank you lord for your word tonight lord we just pray that you would be our helper be our strength lord i pray may father you receive glory in the service here tonight lord i've got many things upon my heart that you've just stirred me with i pray that you would anoint them lord anoint the speaker anoint the hearer lord i pray god that your word would find a place lord in the in the heart of faith of a believer here tonight lord as we reach out and by faith lord and accept it accept whatever you have to say lord that it will come directly from you now god may you just take control we ask granted lord in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated i have that uh powerpoint i don't see the clicker here it is let me just pull it out here i did yeah to the bethel sound booth uh shows i sent it to um bethel tabernacle soundbooth gmail.com got it okay praise the lord amen we have some quotes we'd like to display and then we'll have those just here in a moment i want to i've got a probably way too much uh here tonight to read i don't want to just read all night but i just uh the way the lord just dealt with me this afternoon was just in a very practical way a very uh much of a of a teaching way but that's all right that's just what the way the lord led me i believe that the rapture that we speak of this word uh that we used to speak of the coming of the lord and brother branham used those same exact words in in uh when he's speaking about the coming of the lord there was there's a lot the prophet had to say preaches an entire message called the rapture and uh i believe it's an important uh it's a it's an important topic that we could have as we look at the world and the condition of the world and where we are in time we know it must not be too much longer before some of these things that we read about that jesus just said come to pass i love that john 14 that we read where jesus says let not your hearts be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you and then he says i go to prepare a place for you it's amazing because god prepares the earth in the beginning we find in genesis and it was a perfect world it didn't have any defect now we don't know that world we've never actually experienced that world at all the only the only way we relate to earth is under a curse that's that's all we've ever known in our entire in our life has been a world that's under a curse even our own body we know is subject to that same curse and disease and it's amazing because if you think about it even the earth that is under a curse that we've experienced yet it's a breathtaking beautiful glorious place to live you you go to some of the travel some of the parts of the world even here in the in our own city in beaufort and go over uh you know the bridge when the sun's going down or coming up it's beautiful and you think it just takes your breath away you have postcards and imagine that this is the earth under a curse imagine what it must be without a curse in other words if it's this good under a curse if it's this beautiful under a curse how good is it really the place that jesus said i'm going to prepare a place for you and so we know that he is go he's he's this is this is the type even the scripture here in 1st thessalonians 4 we don't we're not going to teach on that here tonight but we know even the type of the jewish wedding where the there's the betrothal and then there's the purchase price and that and then there's the uh the there's the the engagement and then there's the shout to announce uh the the the the marriage and then the the bride uh goes through the bridegroom leaves and there's a waiting period before he comes back and we know all of these things are taking place right now that jesus said i'm gonna go but i'm going to prepare a place for you and if i go prepare a place for you then i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also first the first thessalonians the scripture that we read is is powerful and i'm going to get into just some of this here for a moment and i'm going to read some quotes here with good brothers if you just let me just mute that here for a second um there we go good i'm going to read something to you here because it's so amazing uh that there are cert certain people uh who are under the belief or and under the teaching that you know that uh that the rapture is uh the coming of the lord has already taken place there's actually people who believe that there's people who believe that the coming of the lord has always already taken place and that uh this is the tribulation right now the tribulation period has set in and that we're going through uh the tribulational signs right now and the the resurrection of the dead has already taken place and some people actually spiritualize that and say it was just a spiritual event but we know that first corinthians 15 the apostle paul says without first corinthians 15 if he be not raised then we're dead in our sins we have no hope thank you brother brad and and it's a it's it's amazing because let me just find my the place here the quote that i would like to read um it's amazing because brother branham covers this and you know there's even there's even the belief that that the rapture takes place after the tribulation post post rapture some people believe in a in a post rapture talking about christians in the world today who believe that the rapture takes place it's amazing because that is the same as to say that the the the groom has married the bride he's espoused her to himself and and so now that we're married now i'm gonna beat you uh to death i'm gonna i'm gonna physically abuse you and then afterwards we're gonna go have dinner and everything's gonna be fine really i mean really that's what you would have to believe if god was to send the church then his bride through the tribulation period i want to cover some of these i think it's really good here brother what brother brandon is speaking of and i'm just going to display these on the screen i want you to notice because it's going to be important as we read some of these that brother branham has a in his understanding that this is going to get a little teachy i got a lot so just follow real close here he has an understanding even amongst the pentecostal group that he's part of and it's it's it's vital to understand that brother branham even when you when you read the quote uh in the church age book and i'm going to read it i didn't have time to display it i'm just going to read it he says what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the spirit now he's referring to the pentecostal revival in this quote here in the church age he's referring to the pentecostal revival and the and the the latter rain movement uh pentecostal movement and then he refers to the 1906 azusa street outpouring of the spirit of god the restoration of gifts and brother branham says what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the spirit it was then believed that this was the indeed long-awaited restoration now when he says it was it was then believed brother branham was one of those in that group who actually believed that so when you read things like brother branham is saying we're going to read some of these quotations here in a minute from 55 he comes under that same exact thinking that that the the pentecostal movement that he was part of was the long-awaited restoration and so when he says it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited resurrection the restoration he says it was not so the lord corrects him on that but he says it was not for the latter rain can only come until after the teaching rain after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain the latter rain then is the harvest rain he says how can this be the real when the teaching reign had not come the prophet messenger is to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the rapture had not come and so he says what was thought to believe so what was what was thought to be it's important because brother branham thought to be even himself up until a certain point before the seals you have to understand that some of the things that the prophet says prior to the seals do we call chuck them out no but you've got to understand it in the light of pre-seals so god hasn't came and revealed this this the the word is not even an open book to him he's there's a lot of baptist theology now listen before we just get too much in that let's just read he says what we need today i believe first is some good old-fashioned persecution to run us together we find out that when the church is really persecuted i believe that god is permitting communism to hit the land so he says what we need is persecution now you're going to see a lot of these things grouped up here some of these comments that brother brandon makes are almost sound exactly the same watch in the great commission but i believe my brethren that there's come in an hour that when a real rank persecution will run us together then we will be one the church will come together i believe it's all in the making of god after painting this picture now remember when you're reading these brother branham has a denominational view of the bible he has a denomination a baptist view of the white horse writer now y'all are quiet but just i'm gonna i'm giving you something these are gonna pop here it's getting light bulbs gonna come on in a minute brother branham has a denominational view of the rapture he has a denominational view of the church ages now when you say denominational uh uh church view baptist view it wasn't that any of those views were the wrong answer and then he got the right answer brother adam says that the the message of the hour was the restoration of the word all of the loose ends to be tied back together so the message isn't new it's not something that happened in 1947 it's not something that ended in 1965 but it was a restoration of the truth that the truth is not a book it's not a doctrine the truth is not a teaching the truth is we've preached many times is jesus christ who said i am the truth and so the truth that we received through the message was not a new idea new theory new revelation it was a restoration that was the message and there's another point i want to make to you here tonight the the the the the messenger this is the message is not william branham's message amos's message when amos came and amos one and he begins to cry out in amos four and he begins to cry against israel amos was just the mailman it wasn't amos's message when jeremiah begins to cry out against jerusalem and he says go into the street see if there be any who seek god see if anybody who looked to the ancient ways that's not jeremiah's message that's the message from god to his servant the prophet who becomes the mouthpiece jeremiah was just the mailman so the message of the hour brother adams the the message that we read you open the table you turn on the book you turn on the tape this is not the message of william branham this is the message of jesus christ who he used the vessel to speak through but let me just say this when it wasn't jeremiah's message though it wasn't amos's message though it wasn't nehemiah or haggai's message though it wasn't isaiah's message it was the message from god but to reject isaiah was to reject god to reject jeremiah was not to reject jeremiah you weren't rejecting amos you were rejecting jehovah amen amen and so the message of the hours just just like the sermon of the minister you that's why it's to get mad at the preacher you're just getting mad at the mailman he's just delivering the mail he's just giving you the message that god gave him so how could we get upset with him and so brother branham as we said he has a he he believes at this time that the white horse rider is christ that's what he believes now god goes and changes him right hello and so he believes this prior then god corrects him now watch now when you're reading some of these things just remember that because he's going to start referring to persecution coming there's a persecution coming there's when they hunt us down like dogs oh when the squeeze really comes on watch the third pool then now watch all of these things and take them in their right context watch he says i believe my brother there's come in an hour the real rank persecution we read that one let's go forward and oh i would have abs uh okay that's that's a little too far let me let me make sure i might have got that one out of order yeah okay in a paradox he says how are we going to lose this great race it's because we're divided how are we going to do it we got to stay together we're all believers in god the holy ghost takes us all in it'll be a paradox if god ever gets us together but he will just trust him the virgin both birth he knows how to send the persecution that will run us together he knows how to send the persecution that will run us together now watch the year 64 april right amen now i want you to notice what happens prior to the seals listen to this in the first seal because remember as we said this is not this is battery might be going dead here guys remember what we said that brother branham it's not when he preaches the seals is not his message he has a he has a a a a church view of the bible but watch what he says here in the first seal backing up here oh i would have absolutely today and i hope that people are spiritual i would have made a horrible mistake on that i would have made a horrible mistake on that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today when the holy spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that i was writing down to say amen so what you find is is that even brother branham let me make sure my notes are in conte in sync with this so that i don't miss something here so so brother madam even before the seals he says i was going to make a terrible mistake but the lord corrected him so watch go a little bit further he says he knows how to run we're to have a persecution that'll run us together he says in a court trial and there is where i knew all the pentecostal groups come together then it'll take a persecution to run you people together you'll never believe it but when that time comes and so what you've had is is you've had groups of people large groups of people who have taken some of the things that brother branham said and said oh what what's coming is persecution what's going to happen next is they've got to shut the doors to the church and they've got to lock them up and we've got to be persecuted we've got to throw we've got to be thrown into jail we've got to be martyred we there's got to be a persecution brother madam said there's got to be persecution to run us together and so what the reason say why is that dangerous because it gives a person the wrong expectation of what to look for next amen because the believer we are commanded not just by the message but by the bible to not live in expectation for persecution but to live in the expectation of the coming of the lord jesus do you know that this is actually commanded in the bible in in philippians i and i don't i don't have them on the screen so i'm going to mute this and you don't try to follow me it's two i'll go through them too quick and in philippians 3 20 i'm going to read these just fast he says but we are citizens of heaven where the lord jesus christ lives and we are earnestly eagerly waiting for him to return as our savior that was philippians here's titus 2 13. looking looking looking for expecting that blessed hope now what is that blessed hope he's referring to what we just read in first thessalonians what we read in john that if i go and prepare a place i will come back to receive you that is the blessed hope that titus is referring to here looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ so what is it as a believer you are taught by the bible to live in an expectation of the imminent return of the lord jesus first thessalonians one or hebrews 9 28 so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation who's the lord jesus going to repair appeared to in the rapture the bible just told us not to the whole world amen amen as people think he's just going to come down and the big great you know uh red carpet is going to roll from the sky and then the clouds and everybody there will be when when all the world does see you but the bible speaks of in first thessalonians 4. i'm just going to quote it here for a minute it says in first thessalonians 4 it says i would not have you uh be ignorant brother uh let me just find my place here and he says for the lord himself shall to sin with from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be called up together amen now that word cult is the greek word harpazo and that greek word harpazo is a physical snatching that's what it means so read it again here he says then we which are alive and remain this is at the coming of the lord this is at the rapture of the church this is at the body change then we which are alive and remain shall be snatched we shall be pulled away we shall be called up together with them now this is not spiritual if you go look up harpazo it's physical it's very it's very tangible it's more of the word it's something a substantive event that actually takes place we shall be caught up together with them so when he says the lord himself shouted sin so what is the rapture in first thessalonians 4 the lord himself shouted sin with a shout what is a shout it's a shout to a message to get the people ready and he says then with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god or the dead in christ shall rise then we which are alive so someone's going to be here that's what the bible says there will be somebody alive there has to be there has to be because people have been dying and dying and dying and dying and dying but there will be a group of people at the coming of the lord first thessalonians 4 we which are alive and remain so there's a real physical people who really will not die they won't taste death it's not the only that's that's actually you know just a few and we're just we we could take time to read a lot of these but we're just going to save it here for tonight but i want you to look here even even did you know that even in the bible uh that that's that this this there's been seven different times that the right that the rapture is mentioned seven different times that we could name a few just in the rapture of of elisha who the bible says who walked with god and and he was or enoch who walked with god and he was not he was not he was raptured he was taken for he had this testimony that he pleased the lord you think of elijah you can think of even it's amazing because even in acts chapter 8 verse 39 it says when they came up out of the water the spirit of the lord suddenly took snatched called up philip away and the eunuch did not see him again but went on his way rejoicing and then philip appears in another city philip just magically disappears so you think you think it there there's a way it's not just so what's going to happen when god raptures his church we shall be we which are alive and remain shall be harponzo snatched up called up taken away there'll be a group of people who have a sudden change suddenly everything changes he says suddenly took philip away and the eunuch did not see him again but went on his way rejoicing you think of second corinthians 12 when the apostle paul says he says i've ca i've had revelations and visions he said i knew a man even once and paul's speaking in the third person and he's speaking about himself he says who was called up that same same exact thing that philip happened to philip paul says whether in the body or not i don't know was he in the in the in the i don't know he said i don't know so he we don't know he said i don't know whether the body you're out of the body i don't know he says but he was called up to the to to paradise and he says and i heard things that are not lawful to speak about and so even the apostle paul is raptured is pulled out of this dimension now where where what it was a vision he says or not i don't know and so we we we know here even the book of revelation it says here in revelations 12 5 7 she brought forth a man child who was the rule of nations with the right of the earth and her child was called up unto god that that word that same exact word there is is used in thessalonians when it says for the lord himself shall descend then we which are alive shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord amen wherefore comfort one another with these words now the only people who need comfort are not those that are comfortable here that's why these words don't mean anything to those people who are comfortable here if you're comfortable here and you see a utopian world and everything in this life is just here and i get all i can get here then really you don't need these words that's why so many people aren't expecting they're they're not living under the expectation of the coming of the lord listen he says here further in first thessalonians 4 1 verse 10 and to wait for his son from heaven who he who he raised from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come first thessalonians 5 6 therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober let us watch that means to eagerly wait to live in expectation to live in constant expectation what is the bible saying it's saying that a believer will conduct your life in a moment by moment expectancy of the return of the lord jesus it's actually commanded of us watch be sober we're citizens of heaven we are eagerly waiting for our savior titus looking for that looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing hebrews 9 he shall appear unto them that look for him shall he appear unto them for the second time without sin unto salvation first thessalonians let us not sleep as do others let us watch and be sober let us live in expectation let us conduct ourself by in a moment by moment expectancy yes amen for the return of the lord it should these these kind of things should stir us up in our own heart to ask our all of us a question are we living are we conducting our daily life in a moment by moment expectation for the lord's return amen are we er it's amazing to me that that that this is the hour when we see the entire world falling apart more than we ever have in our lifetime coming apart at the seams more uncertainty and fear gripping the world and and this is the hour where we open our bible and we read and it says assemble yourselves more so as you see the day approaching and somehow we're assembled less somehow our numbers are just talking physically here our numbers on wednesday nights and on sunday mornings are less than they were prior to 20. think about this just for a moment our not just speaking of our own church and not not here to to to to impugn or label anybody or criticize anybody but just just this should sober us here for a moment churches across the nation when when a world is unraveling and the world is coming apart and the bible says when you say when jesus says when you shall see these things look up for your redemption dwelleth not look up in other words what's he saying look to the promises of god amen look up don't look down don't look around that's what we have a really hard time not doing is we have a hard time not looking around and we can get so entrenched and so right just wound up with the news with the media with social media with what's happening in the white house with what's happening in the election what's happening over here what's that and and we're looking around yeah and then if you're not looking around you're looking down and you're thinking oh my what's gonna happen oh what's what's next but jesus says don't look around don't look down look up look up for your redemption draw nigh and in the hour when when the bible says when you see these things approaching a symbol you're a symbol you know i think it was it was i i i believed i'm just gonna make the statement prior to 2020 prior to 2020 i thought i knew why that scripture was in the bible now i definitely know why that scripture was in the bible when a time when where before we didn't as you see the day approaching assemble yourselves more we're already assembled so now more than ever before at a time of separation and dislocation of people and believers we should take the challenge of the word of god to say assemble yourself in the house of god more so more than you ever have before more than you ever have before john first john 3 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now right now are we the sons of god and he says and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now notice what he says in the next verse and every man that hath this hope this is the same hope and titus when he says looking for that blessed hope this is the same thing that that in the thessalonians paul said let us not sleep as to others but let us watch and be sober let us have an expectation he says every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as the lord is pure what do you do when you live under an expectation of the lord jesus you purify yourself this is real simple when you're living when we are living a life expecting the coming of the lord it draws us to sanctification it draws us to purify our thoughts and our mind and our words and our spirit and our attitudes when we lose that expectation and we're not expecting we're not living like he's coming tomorrow then there's a lack of purification amen amen two plus two equals four it's real simple if you live like the lord's coming tomorrow you're living close to the lord you're purifying every man that hath this whole purified himself so when we get to a state to where we're not living constantly under the fountain or to where we're not living constantly under the presence of god where we're not daily communion with the lord it's because we've lost sight of this hope are you here tonight amen let's pick this back up here brother adam says here he says and he says this is where i knew all the pentecostal groups come together they'll take a persecution it'll take a persecution to run you people together you never believe it but when that time comes so when you give a person a false expectation when you're expecting the wrong thing what do we just read about in the bible what is the next event what is the expectation the coming of the lord listen to what brother branham says here in questions and answers brother branham this now notice this is april this is april paradox april court trial now we come to august brother branham will the bride go through the persecution as the early apostolic church did i want to mute the screen for a moment because i don't think we could make this any more clear of a question and we definitely could not have a clearer answer to a clear question this should end all argument brother man will the bride go through the persecution as the early apostolic church did amen no if there was any moment that he needed to inject something there to say well they've got a there's a persecution coming to run us together to now you remember you'll see here in a moment brother branham comes from that pentecostal group who's thinking that the latter former the the latter rain movement is the indeed long-awaited restoration and then he says but it was thought to be but he realized it was not and so he makes he makes statements about the persecution coming about a tribulation about the bride suffering and and and listen listen to what he says here he says no i just explained that a few minutes ago no next thing is a rapture now next thing is rapture there's going to be many things that follow the rapture but the next thing is the rapture many things are subsequent to the rapture but the next thing for you and for me is the rapture you know why that you know why that gives me such joy because that takes away all fear of anything that's going to happen to this world because what happens to me next does it what happens to them doesn't happen to me how do you know brother matt because i've already read what happens to me next the rapture hallelujah he says remember we're at the promised land where the border you understand the march of israel listen to this now notice but i was just thinking this is now this is the fifth seal listen what brother brandon says i love this quote right here let me pull it up here on my screen he says he says notice but i was just thinking is this precious godly brother john i just thought it would be a good place to inject that just before closing see if john looked over there and them was of his brethren see his brethren that had to suffer a little then see the lord god permitted the lord god permitted me to see my brethren and the saints that were waiting for the coming of the lord now did you ever catch this brother branham says i seen my brethren remember over there he says the who are these people is these branhams he said no these are not brandons these are your converts those that you led to the lord now watch him watch this he says i seen my people i see them and he says i seen my brethren and say well i'm not brother adam's brother i guess he didn't see me and them that were waiting for the coming of the lord i'm in that number he says notice they were not under the altar of sacrifice mine wasn't but these was they were martyrs see mine wasn't under the martyr's altar wow now i want you to listen real close and i'll close honest just about in 10 minutes 10 o'clock and i'll just cut it off and finish it tomorrow look they were not my the ones that the lord showed me the bride she was not under the martyr's block no the sacrifice altar of the martyrs but had received white robes by accepting the pardoning grace of the living word christ had given them a white robe now he comes to you you notice we read in sixth in in august in questions and answers but there was a very important message that precedes questions and answers and it's the message the feast of the trumpets wonderful message i would recommend it if you have want something to listen to this week he comes to this mat this message here and i'm trying to make sure i have it here on mine i do right here he says oh don't you see where we're at don't you see why them trumpets means nothing to us they all sounded under our sick seal you see now why the holy spirit wouldn't let me speak it and the heavenly father knows with the bible before me that's the truth so brother branham just pause for that for a moment before the seals what did we read he said i would have made a horrible mistake and he said i had it all written out i was just about to write it down and the angel of the lord came and corrected me and then he comes out each night before the seals each night the angel of the lord comes and corrects brother branham and gives him the revelation of that seal and then he preaches it so it's not his message it's the message from the throne of god and he says i would have made a horrible mistake but god corrected me now and he says that was important now we would all agree of that we would all hear as believers we would say this the seals to brother branham was the opening of the remember he says the bible becomes a brand new book it becomes a brand new book you can see jesus in every verse from the beginning to the end so everything in previous church light everything he had looked at under church revelation and church light anything that was wrong brother branham starts as the angel lord begins to correct him he comes and changes the white horse rider says it wasn't christ [Music] now watch what he does right before preaching in the uh he he he he believes brother and believes you know the he preaches the seven seals now he thinks okay now i've got to preach the seven trumpets buys a plane ticket you remember this and the holy spirit stops him and says it's not your it's not the time it's not your place now he's thinking this entire time i've got it and you can see what's under the trumpets you could see how brother branham says what the seven seals are to the gentiles the seven trumpets are to the jews now watch what he says here and he says oh don't you see don't you see why them trumpets mean nothing to us they all sounded under the sixth seal you see now why the holy spirit wouldn't let me speak it as the heavenly father knows with this bible before me that's the truth didn't know it till yesterday so this is 7 19 in the morning on sunday i believe this is a sunday morning so on saturday till yesterday day before yesterday in my room there was been friday where he revealed it come to me spoke to me i come back said wife i got it now he just met me in there and told me here it is honey see there it is see perfectly just in harmony and he says he says o people without him getting quick it might be the last opportunity you'll ever be able to have you don't know what time he might come so prior to this friday the holy spirit had not revealed this to brother branham and then he preaches the feast of the trumpets brother manum says you people say what about the early saints this is questions and answers what was that he says that was the now people people say the people say what about the early saints the martyrs he says that was the changing of the dispensations that was under persecution which if you was here to hear this church ages and to see how they went into outer darkness and how to do that then that shows where they had to take that persecution because each one of the church ages that everything begins to show that they were darker and darker until they finally went to a complete place that they denied his name picked up another name that they lived and were dead sardis and then it come on out thyatira sardis then coming out he says then come out then it began to come out to philadelphia so forth then come to the time of the calling out of the bride which was to escape which was to escape all damnation now you see this change in the what brother brandon begins to say listen he says i don't have it on my screen i'm just going to keep reading it here so he he changes this from the friday night brother brandon preaches the feast of the holy spirit comes the angel of the lord comes and speaks to brother branham and the holy spirit begins to completely change and correct everything that he had previously thought so much so that he says you see why the lord wouldn't even allow me to preach it why it did not apply to him it did not apply to us and he says notice this here let me just find my find my place here and feast of the trumpets let me give me just one moment because i didn't realize now i didn't get it here uh on the screen so i want to make sure we get it here yes this is this is this is it here brother branham says this he says now how would a how would a before we come to that let me just read this to you uh quickly in isaiah 24 we're going to pause that just for a moment you can you can take that down brother matthew and then you could follow me on the scriptures so isaiah chapter 24 just come with me there uh quickly we're almost out of time and isaiah 24 verse 1 pro prophecy here this is we're going to read through 24 and then sum of 25. isaiah begins to warn of this and this is just one of the this is just one of one of many scriptures we could have chosen many you can display that isaiah 24 1 this is one of many that we could have chose that refers to the end time or the coming or the the jacob's trouble or the end of the world as we would call it but he begins to warn of this and says behold the lord maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste and turneth it upside down and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof listen to that listen to this prophecy now this is do this is doom and gloom but this is this is a time when i'm not here and you're not here we just read that we just read that he says behold the lord maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste and turneth it upside down boy they think the world is turned upside down now they think the world is turned upside down now they have no idea when the lord turns the world upside down the bible says there will be weeping and welling and gnashing of teeth crying out for the rocks to fall upon them seeking death but they won't find it scattereth abroad the inhabitants of the world so what is this this is a this is a prophecy of judgment as we as we've said brother madam says so many times before there's nothing left for this nation but judgment because why they rejected mercy just as israel rejected mercy when they rejected amos when they rejected jeremiah when they rejected the voices of god that god sent to them to repent and they refuse to repent and what did god do before israel all right let me just catch this here for a moment but before when amos finally comes and amos is the second to last prophet that israel is going to get he's the second last second to last chance of mercy that god sends then he sends hosea and then they vanish but he sends prophet after major after minor minor minor prophet uh coming to israel crying out to them as we said it was god's message to them and after they refused to repent and refuse to turn around israel wasn't just the northern tribes it was also benjamin and judah as well and they had completely turned to idolatry and amos comes with a hard message and he's trying to get their attention and they rejected amos they rejected his word as if he never even spoke amen so god gives one more chance and he gives he sends a tender hearted man a kind man named hosea wasn't to say that amos wasn't kind but his word his words were harsh and so he sins you know the bible says the word of god is is like a two-edged sword and he says that divideth asunder both bone and marrow and spirit and so the word of god when god comes and he and he speaks he can come and he can come like amos who who speaks and tells you this is what god's thinking this is what god's word says this is god's judgment then he sends a man named hosea who's a tenderhearted man a kind man who spoke softly who spoke appealing not accusing is it a different message no amos's message could be summed up in these words return to me you read that over and over and over in amos i sent the mildew and i sent the the corruption and i and i took away your your crops and i caused diseases and he says yet you didn't return to me and so god said what does god do god sends them god sends pestilence and he and he says in amos 4 you go and read it and he and he talks about uh he says i i caused your water to dry up and you know no doubt the israelites thought for sure that was an attack from the enemy from the devil literally they know it was god it was jehovah and he says so he says i took your water and he says i took away all your fresh water and he says yet you did not return to me saith the lord and he said so i sent the mildew and i sent the uh the frost and i forget the other word he uses there and he says and he said he says i sent the tornado i sent the cyclone i said the lightning i burn up your cattle i caused your crops to fail three months before harvest i stopped the rain that's what he says in amos for i cut the rain off and god says yet you did not return to me so i sent disease and he says to your crops and they died and your your entire harvest was was finished yet you did not return to me they just went on and on and on and on so he says so then i sent diseases amongst your people and people died yet you did not return to me and then he says and then i sent raiders enemies who they had not before i sent raiders and they came in and plundered you yeah you did not return to me saith the lord and so then he sends an earthquake remember amos 1 amos 1 1 go read the the very end of amos 1 1 it says the word of the lord which came from god to amos this is written after the fact amos is written in retrospect it's not as it happens it's retrospect in other words the writing is happening after all everything's already taken place it's a record of what happened and when you read amos 1 1 it says the words of the lord that god sent to amos two years before the earthquake two years before the earthquake two years in other words in retrospect you're going to read them i'm writing all this down now what i'm about to write that amos said to them this was 24 months before destruction now they didn't know that when amos opened his mouth on sunday for the first sermon he preached to them god started the timer 24 months and counting and then an earthquake will come and wipe out this place did you know that zachariah 205 years later talks about that earthquake it was so devastating but it's interesting because he writes that it says two years before the earthquake in other words they didn't know anyone living at that time had no idea had no idea when he was just preaching all i'm sure they went to church with all here he goes again talking about how we dress talking about our sisters talking about where we how we live in our entertainments and here he goes preaching again can't we just hear about the love of god and my goodness we already got coronavirus brother i mean my goodness can't you give us something joyful it's christmas i'm sure they would have said any anything against because isaiah amos's only message was just doom and gloom god's coming and it says this is the words the lord spoke through through hosea two years before the earthquake and then 24 months later earthquake comes he sends cat what does god say he says i sent the mildew i sent the frost to i killed your plants so you didn't return then i sent disease then i said reader still you didn't return then i said an earthquake i thought about that and thought my goodness we don't know that we can look back on the other side in retrospect and say little did we know in march of 2020 uh when the covet first broke out that was only 24 months before the rapture took place in retrospect we can say that was only two years before california the earthquake sunk california and it went to the bottom of the ocean just 24 months brothers before that just 24 months could you imagine two years before the earthquake and god says yet you didn't return to me what is this nation done what is it what did just look at the world today what do you think a hurricane is brother madam in the oncoming storm says it's the judgments of god trying to trying to what was it it was judgment but it was mercy because god sends destruction to get our attention to have us turn our hearts back to him no punishment ever got that god ever gives to a believer is to hurt them or damage them it's always to correct them always to turn them around and so god says but you didn't return to me you didn't return to me i spoke you didn't return to me and he says then i said an earthquake but you say oh that was horrible it was terrible but that wasn't the worst of it you know what the worst part was is that god took them out of their promised land and sentiment to babylon and he took what was theirs what would always had always been theirs and god removed them from the promised land but you say brother matt was there something worse than that yeah there was something worse what was worse than the earthquake what was worse than the crop failure what was worse than the disease you know what was worse is that in spite of all of amos's and hosea's preaching nobody cared nobody didn't care didn't care just completely apathetic to everything just oh well no care no concern at all thought about this when you read when you we are at isaiah 24 the lord maketh the earth empty make it that ways turn us upside down in other words this is prophetic what god's going to do and so what's what is god sin he sent judgment what is what what do you think hurricane katrina was what do you think the tsunami that hit japan was what do you think all of the pandemics that we've had besides the coronavirus and now the coronavirus is it's a sign of judgment to a nation that's turned their back on god i sent the mildew i sent the as i killed your cops i sent just i sent judgment yet you didn't return unto me and so he says god would suddenly wipe it out john says that in revelations 18 revelations 18 verse 8 pull that up quickly we're just going to read that and then we'll we'll we'll uh we're going to close not too much longer here john says here and he says in one day john revelation 18 8 one day death and morning in famine and she shall be utterly burned therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning imagine that in one day i think you know it's been things are being over the past few years but god says therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong as the lord god who judgeth her 17 for in one hour one hour now we went from one day to one hour now we know who this is referring to but i want you to notice this prophecy he says for in one hour so great riches has come to naught and every shipmaster and all the company and ships and sailors and as many as trade by the sea stood afar off verse 18 keep going stood afar off and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like unto this great city keep going just keep going verse 19. and they cast dust on their heads and cried we've been well in santa last alas that great city where and we're made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness for in one hour she is made desolate just like that in one hour she has made desolate back to isaiah 24 in verse 10 notice what he begins to speak here and he says the city of no in isaiah 24 verse 10 brother matthew i want to make sure we catch this i want to read it together the city of confusion so there's confusion it's it's it's it's you imagine i can imagine it's going to be grey confusion the day of the lord is like no other day the bible says that it's like no other day that has ever been no nor never will be great confusion is broken down every house is shut up know that no man may come in verse 12 in the city is left desolation and the gate is smitten with destruction verse back go back to verse 6. brother matthew i missed it verse 6 therefore hath the curse devour the earth and they that dwell there and are desolate therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned and few men left it's amazing because when you look at this isaiah speaks of this here and i want to i don't i want to condense some of this so that we don't hold you too long here but it's amazing because he speaks and he says all everything is going to change we titled this message here tonight a sudden change and i thought about we we've we've thought coveted 19 was such a change but they have no idea what a sudden change is coming to the world the bible says for when they say peace and safety then cometh sudden destruction you ever notice that it says that not gradual not drawn out over two or three years but he says when they say peace and safety then sudden sudden amen sudden destruction just just like that rapid overnight and one day in fact in one hour suddenly the whole world isaiah says in verse 6 that we're reading here says therefore uh isaiah 2 26 brother matthew i'm sorry isaiah chapter 26 verse 5 next chapter verse 5 for he bringeth down them that dwell on high the lofty city he layeth it low he layeth it low even to the ground he bringeth it even to the dust we read in 24 the inhabitants of the earth are burned up he layeth it low he layeth it low it bringeth down them that dwell on high them that thought they were so great them that that had had thought that fame was everything god said he makes them low you imagine the chaos in the planet in the world the chaotic moment all everything that they know is life will suddenly cease to exist they think this is i keep referring to this because i think as we've said before the brother who wrote the little poem about coven this is just a dress rehearsal yeah and i've just been thinking of that this is just a preparation of what's coming they have no idea just a precursor they think they think that what life is they've known it oh what's when are we going back to normal when can we get back to normal well what what's normal that's what i want to ask what was normal i know to us what it means to you could be you could you could give reasons and say that was my normal that'd be perfectly appropriate but you know to some people what was normal was a life just laden with sins can we get back to normal normal potter party and partying normal clubbing normal running around normal just normal life they just want to go back to the back to the good old days back to when things were normal oh they have no idea the disorder and the disarray and the dislocation and just the utter sudden change that'll come upon the world no army can save them no government no president no biden no trumps no republicans no democrats no world system no money no amount of money all the money in the world won't save them no experts no experts they put together a team here for covet it's the covid task force good team a lot of doctors a lot of scientists a lot of good educated people and they you see them assembled before press conferences and there's five or six of them they got the expert in disease and then the expert in medicine then the the the expert over here and and they got all of these experts in this team well guess what they they won't have a task force they won't have a team that they can put together to bring a solution to this problem there won't be no experts are you guys here tonight no state troopers no police no sheriff no national guard no supermans that's right no army it'll devastate everything you imagine by you imagine all of the depression that they think is happening now because they haven't been able to work or they've lost you know the hedge fund people have lost you know .02 percent of their income and they then everybody's just going panicking and and and they it's going to be devastating you imagine as the bible says that's why it says there will be weeping and welling and gnashing gnashing of teeth uh look at revelations chapter 18. no we already we already read it you don't have to turn there that's fine i'm going to read it merchants of the of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for fear of her torment weeping and welling saying alas the great city for in one hour so great riches has come to naught overnight overnight restaurants will close and they won't reopen there won't be no eating outdoors they think this is bad oh we got to take take out there won't be no takeout yeah and i'm getting really practical but i just just stay with me here for a moment there won't be there won't be nothing there won't be no the all joy the bible actually says that that all joy omer birth which the bible speaks of a joy will be gone there won't be no happy no happy none they're only be sad there won't be any and no man no matter what you try to do there won't be a fix there won't be no happiness there won't be no more christmas there won't be no more new years there won't be no more mardi gras there won't be no more parties in one moment there's a sudden change everything will change in one hour just in one moment isaiah 24 matthew if you pull that back up in verse 13 he says he says there shall be the shaking of as an olive tree let me just skip some of this here just to save time yes in in verse 2 of 24 that's where it was verse 2 of that chapter i want you to look at this imagine how the everything in life will be changed paul's that just for a moment all activities we we get into such a routine we get into such a routine of of daily living life raising planting building normal that's good but i just want you to catch now now shepherd matt why are you preaching remember i've already i've already we've already established clearly we won't be here so stop looking so sad everybody we won't be here but all the routines all daily activity all plans will be canceled all activity will be canceled there won't be a there won't be no more no more what's coming next no more when will this be over there will be no obsession towards activities or jobs or careers or all dreams all ambitions in one hour the bible says in verse 2 of isaiah chapter 24 it shall be as with people as with the people so with the priest that's with the servant so with his master as with the maid so with her mistress as with the buyer so with the seller as with the lender so with the borrower as with the taker of usury sow with the giver of usury to him amen everybody will be suddenly in the same boat there won't be no class social class of people that's what that's what he's saying here he says suddenly there won't be a the master will be the same as the servant the maid same the buyer the same as the seller the lender will be the same as the borrower everybody will be suddenly in the same boat suddenly this after this suddenly everybody will suddenly have everything in common everybody will have everything in common there won't be any more sports and in fact sports will be the last thing on anybody's mind amen there won't be a super bowl that'd be the furthest thing that you would ever think of anybody would ever think of there will be no more 250 million dollar contracts for athletes they'll be gone the whole world will be in chaos not just america nationwide the whole world will be in calamity the whole world will be suffering every man-made idol will come crashing down there will be no superstar you can look to there won't be no bill gates you can look to there won't be any millionaires that you can look to because everybody will be in the same boat everything will come as the bible says to dust the rich will become the poor alike everybody will be in the same condition suffering the same exact thing no one will have an advantage first thessalonians 5 3 it will happen when they say first thessalonians 5 verse 3. when they shall say peace and safety first thessalonians 5 3 then then sudden destruction upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape i take no joy in thinking or reading that to think of all of the seeds of humanity and all of the well-meaning and people who were dreaming and people who were who were living we take no joy in thinking of the destruction of the wicked that's why that's why we preach mercy now that's why we preach grace now that's why we speak to our to to our to uh to to the people that we have in our life say unsaved whether it's family or friends or work associates that's why we tell the world about jesus that's why we have a heart for for for the lost because we see what's coming and what they could be saved out of that is that is why a preacher gets up and preaches a message about your life and about how you live and how you better get the holy ghost and how you better get more sincere and be more dedicated because there's love bubbling out of our heart that we don't want anybody in this church to miss it we don't want anybody in this church to be here during this moment we want everybody to go [Applause] that's why we preach the things that we preach then sudden destruction then suddenly just suddenly everything changes suddenly everything stops suddenly the whole world is shaking suddenly all government systems all presidents all leaders all powers all ideas but the bible says in first corinthians chapter 52 i want you to turn there if you could first corinthians chapter 15 verse 52 the bible says suddenly the world will change they say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them but here's what the bible says in first corinthians chapter 15 to actually start with verse 50 brother matthew just a couple verses before that now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does corruption inherit incorruption behold i show you a mystery in other words what is that word there for mystery something previously hidden now revealed he says behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep in other words not all of us are going to die not all of us are going to go to death but we shall all be changed notice this next verse for in a moment imagine just like that in a moment you've been serving the lord for how many years you can all say here today i got saved on this day and this year and i've been serving the lord this many years been coming to church this many years but you know what the bible says in a moment just like that in a moment in the twinkling of an eye i don't know what that means i've looked it up and and bible commentators believe it's like how fast the light takes to go and hit the iris in other words when you flip your light switch on how long does it take for your eyes to recognize that the light's on the bible says in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound the dead in christ shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed my brother and my sister the world has fallen under sudden change but there's a sudden change coming to the believer how quick is it all of all of your toilet and all of your sorrow and all of your servant and all of your trouble and all of your worry that you went through in this life

nothing will be the same there won't be no more normal because normal for us every single day sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad sometimes we're up sometimes we're down sometimes we feel good sometimes we don't feel good but after that change there won't be no more of that it'll all just be one glorious experience it'll be one a moment of praise and worship and adoration and thanksgiving
