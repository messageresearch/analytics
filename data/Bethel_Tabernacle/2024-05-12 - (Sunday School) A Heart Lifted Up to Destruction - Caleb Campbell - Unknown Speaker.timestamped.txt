[5:23] good morning God bless you all this
[5:25] morning good to be in the house of the
[5:28] Lord let's just all stand and we're
[5:30] going to open up our Bibles this morning
[5:33] and turn to the book of 2
[5:37] chonicles chapter
[5:40] 26 2 Chronicles chapter
[5:46] 26 and we're going to read 1 through
[5:48] five and then catch two verses later on
[5:51] there and it says then all the people of
[5:54] Judah took Uzziah who was 16 years old
[5:57] and made him King in the room of his
[5:59] father
[6:00] amziah he built eloth and restored it to
[6:03] Judah after that the King slept with his
[6:07] fathers 16 years old was Uzziah when he
[6:10] began to Reign and he reigned 5 and2
[6:14] years in Jerusalem his mother's name
[6:17] also was jaia of Jerusalem and he did
[6:21] that which was right in the sight of the
[6:22] Lord according to all that his father
[6:25] amziah did and he sought God in the days
[6:29] of zachar
[6:30] who had understanding in the visions of
[6:32] God and as long as he sought the Lord
[6:35] God made him to prosper and then we're
[6:38] going to pick up two more verses 15 and
[6:42] 16 and it says and he made in Jerusalem
[6:45] engines invented by cunning men to be on
[6:48] the towers upon the bull rocks to shoot
[6:52] arrows and great stones with all and his
[6:54] name spread far abroad for he was
[6:58] marvelously helped till he was strong
[7:01] and I want us to notice in verse 5 it
[7:03] said God made him prosper in everything
[7:06] that he did and then now going into
[7:08] verse 16 it says but when he was strong
[7:12] his heart was lifted up to his
[7:14] Destruction for he transgressed against
[7:17] the Lord his God and went into the
[7:19] Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon
[7:21] the altar of incense and my title this
[7:23] morning is going to be a heart lifted up
[7:25] to destruction so let's just go before
[7:27] the Lord Heavenly Father we just thank
[7:29] you for for this day we thank you for
[7:30] the reading of your word Lord we just
[7:32] pray that you would father have
[7:33] preeminence in the service today Lord we
[7:36] just come today to hear from you Lord
[7:38] God in Sunday school Lord Jesus just
[7:40] teach us a lesson father we love you and
[7:42] we ask these things in Jesus name amen
[7:45] God bless you as you take your seats
[7:46] this
[7:47] morning some of this story uh may sound
[7:50] familiar if you've listened to the
[7:52] sermon influence lately uh brother
[7:54] random preaches it several times um just
[7:56] for a brief history this morning the
[7:59] king we're talking about is King Uzziah
[8:02] and we read that uzziah's father's name
[8:05] was amziah and amiah had turned from the
[8:08] Lord towards the end of his leadership
[8:10] in Judah and the the Bible said that he
[8:12] had actually conspired against the Lord
[8:14] and he was slain because of it and his
[8:17] son Uzziah was 16 at the time and he
[8:20] became king Amen in his in instead and
[8:24] the Bible says that he sought God in the
[8:25] days of Zachariah and as long as he
[8:27] sought the Lord and stayed with the word
[8:31] that was given to him as long as he
[8:33] stayed with that word god prospered him
[8:36] and that's something that that's always
[8:37] needed in prosperity is constant
[8:40] humility amen constant uh reflection on
[8:43] on what's important and what's what's
[8:44] what we're supposed to keep our eyes
[8:46] focused on uh we're going to get a
[8:48] little into uh uzziah's life and also
[8:51] the prophet Isaiah's life God was with
[8:54] King Uzziah most of his life much of his
[8:58] life and he greatly Pro prospered
[9:00] everything that he did the Bible says
[9:02] that he went to war with the Philistines
[9:05] and just to dive into some history this
[9:06] morning of just how much the Lord was
[9:08] with him the Bible says that he broke
[9:10] the walls of gath and the walls of jab
[9:14] and the walls of ashod and these were
[9:17] all these great kingdoms around them at
[9:19] the time and then on top of that the
[9:22] Bible says that he built cities about
[9:25] ashdod and among the Philistines So Not
[9:27] only was he successful to defeat those
[9:30] enemies but God gave him so much grace
[9:33] and strength that he built cities among
[9:36] the enemies which showed how greatly
[9:38] feared and revered his kingdom was at
[9:40] the time amongst the ranks of all of
[9:43] these great Kingdoms in the land and it
[9:45] goes on to say that God helped him
[9:47] against the Arabians and the Mims um and
[9:50] we're reading this out of 2 Chronicles
[9:52] 26 all of these victories that God
[9:54] helped King Uzziah achieve during his
[9:57] Reign what happened is his name began
[10:01] spreading abroad even entering all the
[10:04] way into Egypt he began to develop a
[10:07] name for himself you know and I was
[10:10] reading um uh in Deuteronomy lately and
[10:14] something that struck me about Moses is
[10:17] how humble Moses remained during his
[10:20] time you know the Bible says that he
[10:22] became like a god to the people he was
[10:23] so involved in some of the greatest
[10:26] histories in the Bible and the most
[10:28] incredible victories you know with a
[10:29] crooked staff he he went in into the
[10:32] strongest nation in the world and yet
[10:33] throughout all these Miracles and all
[10:35] these victories he was always pointing
[10:37] back to God and that's something with
[10:39] leadership uh like these Kings had or
[10:41] these prophets or these Great Men it
[10:43] wasn't anything that these men did it
[10:46] was simply God doing something in their
[10:48] life that God using them to fulfill his
[10:53] purpose and that's the trouble that King
[10:55] Uzziah began to face he had all of these
[10:59] victories amen and and if you're if
[11:01] you're not careful and catch this if
[11:03] you're not careful blessings are an
[11:05] amazing thing that the Lord does in our
[11:07] lives amen but if we let those blessings
[11:10] turn us from the things of God it begins
[11:13] to influence you away from humility and
[11:17] dependence on God and you as Solomon
[11:20] would put it would start leaning on your
[11:23] own understanding of things and we'll
[11:25] catch that very thing cuz it caused this
[11:27] righteous King to catch leprosy and
[11:30] eventually die um moving further in
[11:33] chapter 26 it says that he built Towers
[11:36] in the desert and he built many great
[11:38] Wells and he had cattle he had great
[11:41] fields and incredible Vineyards in the
[11:43] mountain and his army had grown Mighty
[11:47] in number it had grown to be well over
[11:50] 300,000 men at the time and it said that
[11:53] even these specially they crafted these
[11:57] specially built engines to be high upon
[12:00] Towers so his military was not only on
[12:03] land but it was in the sky these engines
[12:05] they shot large stones and arrows at
[12:08] Great distances among the enemies what
[12:10] was going on was is it was a
[12:12] revolutionary thing in that time to have
[12:15] those engines in war and it was
[12:17] something that God was doing to prosper
[12:19] his kingdom and prosper his land but
[12:22] catch this in second chronicles 26:15 it
[12:24] says and he made in Jerusalem engines in
[12:29] vented by cunning men to be on the
[12:31] towers and upon the bull rocks to shoot
[12:34] arrows and great stones and his name was
[12:36] Spread spread far above and he was
[12:38] marvelously helped he was marvelously
[12:41] helped until he became strong look what
[12:46] happens when he didn't give humility he
[12:50] didn't bring himself to subjection into
[12:52] the humility of God through what was God
[12:54] was prospering in his life watch what he
[12:56] did he began to forget the import things
[13:00] and how it was God that was the one that
[13:02] was doing these Mighty things you know
[13:04] what happened his prayer life started
[13:07] decrease his study of scripture started
[13:09] to slack and then the most incredible
[13:12] thing is the when Pride stepped in this
[13:15] next verse catches us because when
[13:18] you're not if you're not careful you can
[13:20] be like King Uzziah in verse 16 when God
[13:24] chooses to prosper us we have to ensure
[13:28] that our eyes never get off what what he
[13:31] has in store for us we have to make sure
[13:34] that we're constantly in reflection this
[13:36] is God reflecting off me into whatever
[13:39] he's causing me to do it's not me I'm
[13:41] not doing anything it's God Amen it's
[13:43] God in your life doing the things that
[13:46] he needs to do amen but watch what
[13:48] happens in verse 16 if you want to put
[13:50] that up
[13:52] but when he was strong catch that but
[13:56] when he was strong his heart was lifted
[13:59] up to his Destruction for he
[14:01] transgressed against the Lord as God and
[14:04] he went into the Temple of the Lord to
[14:06] burn incense upon the altar of incense
[14:10] when he was strong his heart was lifted
[14:12] up Proverbs 16 you know that quotation
[14:14] of that famous saying Pride goeth Before
[14:17] Destruction and a hotty spirit before it
[14:20] fall he let himself think that it was
[14:22] his name and his power and his Prestige
[14:26] that was what caused all of these great
[14:29] victories and watch we want to catch
[14:32] these next few verses what happened is
[14:34] is that he got himself into this place
[14:35] where he had this position and he
[14:37] thought because he had this position now
[14:39] he can take the place of a priest and he
[14:41] can go in and burn incense when that was
[14:43] not what he was called to do and watch
[14:45] where his pride comes in verse 16 we'll
[14:48] go into verse 17 and Azariah the priest
[14:51] went in after him and with him four
[14:53] score Priests of the Lord that were
[14:55] Valiant men and they with stod Uzziah
[14:58] the king and said unto him it
[15:00] appertaineth not unto thee Uzziah to
[15:02] burn incense unto the Lord but to the
[15:05] priests the son of Aaron that are
[15:07] consecrated to burn incense to go out of
[15:09] the sanctuary for thou Hast trespassed
[15:13] neither shall it be for thine honor from
[15:15] the Lord God then Uzziah was wroth
[15:18] correction came to the king but Uzziah
[15:21] was wroth and had a sensor in his hand
[15:22] to Burnt incense and while he was wroth
[15:25] with the priests the leprosy even rose
[15:28] up in his forehead before the priests in
[15:31] the house of the Lord from beside the
[15:33] incense altar instantly God gave him
[15:36] leprosy there and Azariah the chief
[15:38] priest and all the priests looked upon
[15:40] him and behold he was leprous in his
[15:42] forehead and they thrust him out from
[15:44] then yay himself also had to go out
[15:47] because the Lord had smitten him and
[15:49] catch this verse and Uzziah the King was
[15:52] a leper until the day of his death and
[15:55] dwelt in a several house being a leper
[15:57] for he was cut off from the house of the
[16:00] Lord and jotham his son was over the
[16:02] King's house judging the people of the
[16:05] land so you catch this look how he went
[16:09] from this man of great Prestige and a
[16:12] mighty man of the land and he he won
[16:15] these wars and he had all these
[16:17] victories and it was just he it was just
[16:19] incredible and he let his pride get the
[16:21] better of him and God struck him with
[16:23] Leprosy right there and he stayed a
[16:26] leper until the day of his death says he
[16:29] was cut off from the house of the Lord
[16:31] he couldn't even attend to his Affairs
[16:33] as a king any longer it says that his
[16:35] son jotham was over the King's house and
[16:37] was in charge of all the affairs from
[16:39] that time and you know your your first
[16:41] look at this you think well you know he
[16:44] was trying to do a service to the Lord
[16:46] but you look at his attitude toward it
[16:48] and not only his attitude but his
[16:50] position his heart was lifted up towards
[16:54] destruction and then he went into the
[16:57] temple so watch what happens what is the
[17:00] intention of your heart you I just
[17:02] listened to brother brandom and he said
[17:04] catch the intention of what what it is
[17:07] that you're doing and that's what you're
[17:08] going to gauge on what you need to make
[17:10] that decision what's your intention of
[17:12] it his heart was lifted up towards
[17:15] destruction then he went into the temple
[17:18] you know that was that was the job of
[17:20] the priest and he had gotten to such a
[17:21] point in his life that he lifted himself
[17:24] and really there's just a great lesson
[17:26] in this you know God uses men and he
[17:28] uses women to accomplish tasks and and
[17:31] I've made I've made that point several
[17:33] times over the last couple of months um
[17:35] but this is this is a major butt
[17:38] remember it's not you that it's the one
[17:41] accomplishing those tasks it's God Amen
[17:44] it's God in you amen it's God through
[17:47] you Moses didn't have it in him to go
[17:50] and to deliver Egypt but God did and he
[17:53] used Moses and through Moses he
[17:55] accomplished so many things incredible
[17:57] Feats in history you just you go read I
[17:59] mean we we all know the scriptures go
[18:01] read the book of Exodus just it's
[18:04] incredible God was using that man and
[18:06] God God found a man by the name of King
[18:09] Uzziah and he did that was was right in
[18:12] the sight of the Lord he conquered many
[18:14] enemies you know he crafted these armies
[18:17] and this groundbreaking Machinery you
[18:21] know groundbreaking military strategy
[18:24] but somewhere along the way some some
[18:28] thought that he started to get in his
[18:30] mind started to focus away from God and
[18:33] away from well you know in verse 5 God
[18:37] said that he prospered me in everything
[18:38] that I did but somewhere along the lines
[18:40] in verse 16 my my heart became lifted up
[18:44] against my own thoughts amen against
[18:46] myself um or towards myself I'm sorry
[18:49] and you know that's that's uh that's
[18:52] exactly how how King Nebuchadnezzar was
[18:54] humbled he he exalted himself and then
[18:56] God humbled him so low to become like an
[18:58] animal for seven years um so we're going
[19:01] to read in Isaiah chapter 6 and we're
[19:04] going to pick this story up where Isaiah
[19:07] picks things up in his book so if you
[19:09] want to turn in your Bible to Isaiah the
[19:12] 6th
[19:16] chapter I chose not to read it for an
[19:19] opening verse so we could read it
[19:21] now and if you read the top it says
[19:24] Isaiah's transforming vision
[19:29] in the year and this is important to
[19:32] catch this in the year that King Uzziah
[19:35] died I saw also the Lord sitting upon
[19:39] the throne high and lifted up and his
[19:41] train filled the temple and above it
[19:44] stood the seraphim each one had six
[19:46] wings with Twain he covered his faith
[19:49] face and with Twain he covered his feet
[19:51] and with Twain he did fly and one Cried
[19:54] unto another said holy holy holy is the
[19:57] Lord of hosts and the whole Earth is
[19:58] full of his glory and the post of the
[20:01] door moved at the voice of him that
[20:02] cried and the house was filled with
[20:05] smoke then I said woe is me for I am
[20:08] undone because I am a man of unclean
[20:12] lips and I dwell in the midst of a
[20:14] people of unclean lips for mine eyes
[20:17] have seen the king the Lord of hosts
[20:20] then flew one of the seraphim unto me
[20:23] having a live coal in his hand which he
[20:24] had taken with the tongs from off the
[20:27] Altar and laid it upon my mouth and said
[20:30] Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine
[20:34] iniquity is taken away and thy sin is
[20:37] purged that's one thing I want to catch
[20:39] here in a few minutes my thine iniquity
[20:42] is taken away iniquity and thy sin is
[20:45] purged also I heard the voice of the
[20:47] Lord saying whom shall I send and who
[20:49] will go for us then I said here am I
[20:52] send me brother brandom says in the
[20:54] sermon influence in 1963 paragraph 165
[20:57] he says then notice then after the
[21:01] confession after the cleansing then came
[21:05] comes the commission then was the
[21:07] commission after confessed and cleansed
[21:10] it was then that clean Isaiah answered
[21:13] God and said here am
[21:16] I send me after he was cleansed
[21:19] confessed cleansed by the fire then the
[21:22] clean Isaiah was ready for work he was
[21:24] ready to be an example he was ready to
[21:26] have to put his life out so that others
[21:29] could be influenced by him but he says
[21:32] in paragraph 166 but until he had
[21:35] confessed it until he was cleansed then
[21:39] he was a very poor influence and look
[21:41] what brother random says just a puppet
[21:44] for the king just a puppet and in Ser we
[21:47] would see Jesus 1963 brother Bram says
[21:49] you can live with someone so long and
[21:51] around them until you take up their ways
[21:55] and it's good for us not to run off and
[21:57] live with the world
[21:59] but stay with Jesus until we can reflect
[22:02] his life catch this his life be
[22:05] reflected in our life and that's the way
[22:08] those disciples were then they knew that
[22:10] they had been around Jesus because they
[22:12] talked like him he's referring to acts
[22:14] when they had they said that he was like
[22:16] they were around Jesus they acted like
[22:18] them he healed like them and every
[22:19] answer was like them they were inspired
[22:21] like them and they know that he was
[22:23] living in them that's what we should be
[22:26] all the time as Believers at they acting
[22:29] like him cuz if you associate with
[22:31] someone so long amen now I want I look
[22:34] at this point that the prophet makes you
[22:36] can live with someone so long you can
[22:39] hang around somebody so long you can
[22:41] have friends or acquaintances for such a
[22:43] time and you'll begin to mimic their
[22:46] behavior whether you like it or not that
[22:49] is in our nature this is one of the
[22:52] great importances of who you surround
[22:55] yourself with is why it's so important
[22:58] because whether or not you think you
[23:00] will you will become like them amen
[23:02] that's why it's so important and so
[23:04] vital to spend as much time with the
[23:06] Lord Jesus cu the more time you spend
[23:08] with him the more that you can become
[23:10] like him
[23:12] amen it it matters not Prophet or no
[23:15] prophet he was a he was a prophet and it
[23:17] said that he was a puppet for the king
[23:20] God had to Humble himself in that amen
[23:23] and the prophet our Prophet brother
[23:25] Brandon picks this up in several places
[23:27] saying that the Isaiah that Isaiah had
[23:29] been influenced by that King Uzziah he
[23:32] had been so blessed King Uzziah had been
[23:34] so blessed of the Lord in everything
[23:37] that he did and they had become friends
[23:40] and then Isaiah watched as he fell to
[23:42] his destruction and died as a leopard
[23:45] because it was in the year that King
[23:46] Uzziah died and then it was in that same
[23:49] year that the scripture refers to as
[23:51] Isaiah's transforming Vision he stood
[23:54] there in the presence of the Lord in
[23:56] verse 5 uh you know the that's what the
[23:58] header is is the effect of the vision it
[24:00] says woe is me for I am undone Isaiah
[24:03] says mine eyes have seen the king the
[24:05] Lord of hosts amen and his eyes had and
[24:09] his influence was was so focused on King
[24:14] Uzziah and everything that God was
[24:16] prospering in his life that somewhere
[24:18] along the lines his eyes was off of God
[24:20] and it was now on King Uzziah even
[24:21] though it was God doing those things
[24:23] through King Uzziah the prophet Isaiah's
[24:25] eyes now lost focus of God and were
[24:27] focused on King Uzziah his eyes had just
[24:30] been so so
[24:33] lost that it was then that Isaiah could
[24:36] say that my eyes Now Behold The King
[24:40] this King had died now my eyes behold
[24:43] the
[24:46] king in brother Brenham influence
[24:48] another one 1964 he says now the effects
[24:51] of such a vision and we're closing start
[24:53] praying for the sick in a few minutes
[24:54] now the effects of such a vision what
[24:57] did the effects do to this Prophet I
[24:59] wonder about a preacher I wonder about
[25:01] an evangelist or a pastor look at what
[25:04] this Vision look what a vision of this
[25:06] done what he had seen what happened to
[25:08] the self-styled Uzziah and then though a
[25:11] great man that God had honored the great
[25:13] thing they seen it dead what effects did
[25:15] it have on this Prophet iniquity and he
[25:18] says what is Iniquity iniquity is
[25:20] something that you know it's wrong and
[25:22] still holding to it when you know your
[25:25] Creeds are wrong and you still hold to
[25:27] it that's iniquity
[25:28] but when he confessed that he was wrong
[25:31] there was a cleansing power that took
[25:34] that took place he took a coal and did
[25:35] you notice um what happened was when
[25:38] Isaiah got caught away from the
[25:40] influences because it was it was a year
[25:43] that that he had the vision he finally
[25:46] had gotten into the presence of God and
[25:49] it was at this time that Isaiah was
[25:51] given this Great Commission to go amen
[25:54] here am I send me go into and fulfill
[25:58] what I have in place for your life you
[26:00] know and I think sometimes bringing it
[26:02] down to us is we get so wrapped up in
[26:04] our lives and the influences because it
[26:06] doesn't have to be a person it can be a
[26:08] place that you go to it can be a thing
[26:10] that you listen to it can be something
[26:11] that you watch influences get caught up
[26:13] in our life and they're holding on to us
[26:15] when God is trying to send us into
[26:18] action amen he's trying to send us he's
[26:20] saying go who will go for me who will go
[26:23] and that next verse he says verse 9 he
[26:25] says go and tell my people hear ye and
[26:28] indeed but understand not and see indeed
[26:30] but perceive not and it was the very
[26:33] next chapter I I caught this and the
[26:36] Lord just opened this up to me it was
[26:38] the very next chapter when the prophecy
[26:40] comes forth out of a vision that Behold
[26:42] a virgin shall conceive possibly one of
[26:45] the greatest prophecies ever to come
[26:46] forth because it beheld the coming King
[26:49] it beheld our savior it beheld Jesus the
[26:51] Christ Isaiah had that in the next
[26:54] chapter and it wasn't until he could get
[26:56] his eyes off of a king and get his eyes
[26:59] on the king that God would give him such
[27:01] a vision to go forward because I've got
[27:04] these prophecies I've got these things
[27:06] that I want you to do but your eyes are
[27:08] not focused on me your eyes are focused
[27:11] on
[27:12] aching and and look at what the prophet
[27:15] says here I love this now he Isaiah he's
[27:17] referring to is cleansed now he is
[27:19] cleansed and confessed and called and
[27:22] commissioned to be a prophet and God let
[27:24] him write the entire Bible in 66 books
[27:27] of the Bible there is 66 chapters in
[27:29] Isaiah starts in Genesis then he comes
[27:31] to the middle of the book come John the
[27:32] Baptist goes Plum over into the
[27:34] Millennium reign in Isaiah 65 and 66
[27:37] that's right the Revelation he wrote the
[27:39] entire outline of the Bible why because
[27:42] he humbled himself when he saw the
[27:45] presence of God what did he do and his
[27:48] after he did that and humbled himself
[27:50] was cleansed and set aside cleansed and
[27:53] commissioned he had influenced millions
[27:55] of people here in this book and Isaiah's
[27:58] fting that influenced me men I'm sorry
[28:00] men from this time to on brother
[28:03] benham's just making the the statement
[28:05] that the book of Isaiah has ministered
[28:07] to men and women for for a millennia for
[28:11] hundreds for a thousand years and
[28:13] inspired and done all these things but
[28:15] it wasn't he couldn't get past chapter
[28:17] six until he got his eyes off of aching
[28:21] and got his eyes on the king he humbled
[28:23] himself where you let the glory uh we
[28:27] can't let let ourselves be like the that
[28:30] King get like that King and let the
[28:32] glory shift Focus From God to you or or
[28:36] let your ability or or something that
[28:38] you did you may be and listen to this
[28:41] Saints you may be in a season of
[28:42] blessing and everything you may be
[28:45] touching may be blessed from God just
[28:47] like King Uzziah and blessings are
[28:50] wonderful but listen you need to keep
[28:52] pointing to him amen don't let them
[28:55] hinder you don't let them get you off
[28:57] track sometimes s we let blessings
[28:59] distract our prayer life you know maybe
[29:01] we're not in a financial need at the
[29:03] time or we're not in some need of a
[29:05] physical healing or we we don't have
[29:07] need of overcoming power of some mental
[29:10] anxiety at the time but then that can
[29:12] lead to complacency if you're not
[29:14] careful amen we need to keep our eyes
[29:16] focused don't lose focus and remember
[29:19] that our life is to magnify the Lord
[29:21] Jesus Christ it's to preach him
[29:23] crucified amen Paul would say I didn't
[29:26] come to you and Excellency of speech or
[29:29] in wisdom of man I came with a
[29:31] determined heart to preach Jesus save
[29:35] him crucified amen our life isn't about
[29:38] how much money we can accumulate or the
[29:41] prestige that's what was King uz eyes
[29:44] problem he got Prestige he got money he
[29:46] got nice things he got military strategy
[29:48] and those were all nice blessings but
[29:49] they were from God and His Eyes got off
[29:52] focus
[29:55] amen it was in two verses it was he was
[29:58] marvelously helped till he was strong
[30:01] but when he was strong REM remember the
[30:04] psalmist would say our whence cometh our
[30:07] help our Help Cometh From The Lord who
[30:10] make Heaven and Earth
[30:18] amen and just picking up there in Isaiah
[30:21] one of God's Great Angels took the coal
[30:24] from off the Altar and burning it with
[30:27] the fire of the word of God and I love
[30:29] how how it's put there because the word
[30:32] puts it it wasn't just a coal but it was
[30:34] a live coal it was fresh out of the fire
[30:38] amen and it said that this hath cleansed
[30:41] your lips thine iniquity is taken away
[30:44] and thy sins are purged amen I know this
[30:47] is a Sunday school lesson but Purge my
[30:49] iniquities Purge my sins and then after
[30:53] he was purged then he heard the word of
[30:55] the Lord and it must have sounded like
[30:57] the sound of many Waters amen whom shall
[31:01] I send look at the Zeal of the Prophet
[31:03] after that being in that presence
[31:05] knowing that he had done such wrong but
[31:08] yet he stood there praising and it was
[31:10] at that point that God was ready to use
[31:13] him amen and the scripture that I I
[31:15] chose to end on this morning comes out
[31:18] of Psalms 119 I I may do a lesson on it
[31:21] at some point because it's just so
[31:22] striking everything in Psalms 119 points
[31:25] to words along the effect of teach me
[31:29] the way of thy statutes establish Thy
[31:32] word unto your servant and in Psalms 13
[31:36] Psalms 119 verse 133 says the psalmist
[31:39] writes order my steps in thy word and
[31:43] let not any iniquity have dominion over
[31:47] me order my steps in thy word and let
[31:50] not any iniquity have dominion over me
[31:52] how do you keep yourselves humble how
[31:54] how do we keep ourselves away from
[31:56] iniquity he writes it so simple order
[31:59] every step you take in the word of God
[32:03] keep it ever before you write it on your
[32:06] lamp post write it on your bed post and
[32:09] God will keep those things away from you
[32:11] amen let's just stand and
[32:15] pray Heavenly Father we just want to
[32:17] thank you for this day Lord we thank you
[32:18] for the word we just pray that father we
[32:20] can Lord just come into your presence
