[0:00] to
[0:01] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing
[0:06] I've made it. When it's all about
[0:12] you, it's all about you,
[0:17] Jesus. I'm coming back to the heart of
[0:24] worship. And it's all about you.
[0:29] It's all about you,
[0:33] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing
[0:38] I've made it. When it's all about
[0:44] you, it's all about you,
[0:51] Jesus. When the music fades,
[0:59] When the music
[1:02] fades and all is stripped
[1:05] away, and I simply
[1:10] [Music]
[1:13] come, longing just to
[1:18] bring something that's of
[1:21] worth that will bless your heart.
[1:25] [Music]
[1:28] Oh, I'll bring you more than a
[1:33] song. Cuz a song in itself is not what
[1:38] you have
[1:42] required. No
[1:44] sir, you search much deeper
[1:49] within than the way things appear.
[1:53] You're looking into my
[1:58] heart. Sing it joy. I'm coming back to
[2:03] the heart of
[2:07] worship and it's all about you. Yes,
[2:11] Lord. It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:16] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made
[2:22] it. When it's all about
[2:27] you, it's all about you,
[2:33] Jesus. King of endless
[2:35] [Music]
[2:40] world. King of endless world.
[2:46] No one could
[2:48] express how much you
[2:51] deserve.
[2:56] Amen. Though I'm weak and
[3:00] poor, all I have is
[3:04] yours. Every single breath.
[3:09] [Music]
[3:15] Yes Lord
[3:17] [Music]
[3:19] is not what you have
[3:24] [Music]
[3:26] require. You search much deeper
[3:31] within than the way things appear.
[3:35] You're looking into my arms.
[3:40] [Music]
[3:43] I'm coming back to heart of
[3:49] worship and it's all about you. Yes,
[3:53] Lord. It's all about you,
[3:58] Jesus. I'm sorry,
[4:02] Lord. I've made it when it's all about
[4:09] you. It's all about you,
[4:14] Jesus. I'm coming back to the heart of
[4:21] worship. And it's all about
[4:25] you. It's all about you,
[4:30] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing
[4:35] I've made it. It's all about
[4:41] you. It's all about you,
[4:47] Jesus. It's all about
[4:51] you. It's all about
[4:55] you. It's all about
[4:59] you,
[5:03] Jesus. Amen. Jesus the
[5:07] word you know um my name is Luther
[5:12] Jordan and that Sunday
[5:14] school I give it my approval amen 100%.
[5:19] I can confess and witness and testify to
[5:22] you that I was not raised in anything
[5:24] under the opaces of the word and how to
[5:27] courtship and how to relate to the
[5:29] opposite sex if you want to call it
[5:32] that. And um all that does is bring you
[5:36] scars. It just ruins your life. But if
[5:40] you do follow the plan of God the way
[5:41] that he meant it to
[5:43] be, amen, you'll be very, very happy and
[5:46] you won't be all scarred and messed up.
[5:49] Amen. Let's pray. Father, I love you
[5:52] this morning. And I thank you for your
[5:54] word. I thank you for the Sunday school.
[5:56] And I thank you, Lord, for the courage
[5:58] of the minister to stand here and just
[6:00] bring the word of God the way it was
[6:02] written, the way it should be for each
[6:04] and every one of
[6:06] us. And Lord, for all these young
[6:09] people, all those that have been raised
[6:11] in the message of the hour, Father, how
[6:14] we know the enemy wants to
[6:16] intrude, invade, change things, make it
[6:20] seem like it's so much better out in the
[6:22] world and the way the world does
[6:25] things. But Lord, as we as your children
[6:28] with message, faith, and revelation in
[6:31] our heart, we know that your way is the
[6:33] best way. And we thank you for that.
[6:35] Father, I pray for those that'll be
[6:38] streaming this morning, may not be able
[6:41] to be here, but I pray that your
[6:43] presence would be with them. Father,
[6:45] there is nothing like just
[6:47] sitting in a closet of prayer or just
[6:50] meditation and have your presence come.
[6:53] Comfort the heart and strengthen us.
[6:56] Father, the gift that comes forth this
[6:59] se this morning to break the bread of
[7:02] life. I pray that you would magnify it
[7:04] before our eyes. Help us open our hearts
[7:07] to receive what you have for us,
[7:09] Father. As we collect the tithes and
[7:11] offerings, I pray that you bless the
[7:13] cheerful giver, Father, in Jesus name.
[7:17] Amen. Of
[7:19] worship. And it's all about you.
[7:25] It's all about you,
[7:28] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing
[7:33] I've
[7:35] made when it's all about
[7:39] you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm
[7:45] sorry. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I
[7:50] made it when it's all about you, Lord
[7:55] Jesus. It's all about you,
[8:02] Jesus. It's all about him. Amen. 24/7,
[8:07] 365. Can you say amen? I just want to
[8:10] welcome everyone to the house of the
[8:12] Lord again. And why don't you greet one
[8:13] another in the name of the Lord? Tell
[8:16] them you miss him. Tell them you love
[8:17] him since the last time you seen him.
[8:19] You miss
[8:19] [Music]
[8:25] him. Appreciate the spirit of worship
[8:27] everyone has this

[35:51] unworthy
[35:52] [Music]
[36:01] one now Lord I've
[36:04] never
[36:07] regreted one day
[36:10] serving you.
[36:13] You're
[36:15] always right
[36:18] there when I need someone just to talk
[36:24] to. So I'll
[36:26] gladly live for
[36:29] you. Till my race here is
[36:34] round. Lord,
[36:36] I'll always be your
[36:39] most
[36:41] unworthy one.
[36:45] Lord, how I love
[36:47] [Music]
[36:48] you, adore
[36:51] you. I bow down before
[36:56] you. I'll
[36:59] gladly live for
[37:02] you, even die for you if I have to.
[37:08] I'll
[37:10] always be
[37:13] grateful for all you have
[37:18] done. Even though I was the
[37:23] most
[37:25] unworthy
[37:29] one. Lord, how I love
[37:32] you, adore you.
[37:36] I bow down before
[37:40] you. I'll
[37:42] gladly live for
[37:45] you, even die for you if I have
[37:51] to. I'll
[37:54] always be
[37:56] grateful for all you have done.
[38:03] Even
[38:04] though I was the
[38:07] most
[38:08] unworthy
[38:12] one, Lord, how I love
[38:16] you, adore
[38:18] you. I bow down before
[38:24] you. I'll
[38:26] gladly live for
[38:29] you, even die for you.
[38:33] If I have
[38:35] to, I'll
[38:37] always be
[38:40] grateful for all you have
[38:45] done. Even
[38:47] though I was your
[38:50] most unworthy one.
[38:58] [Applause]
[38:59] [Music]
[39:03] Amen. I tell you what, if all these
[39:05] singers keep practicing, they're really
[39:06] going to be
[39:09] something. I sure love all the wonderful
[39:13] privilege the Lord has given us with
[39:15] good music and good singing. Amen. Turn
[39:18] around and shake somebody's hand. Say,
[39:19] "Greetings." God bless you, pilgrim.
[39:21] Welcome everyone to the house of the
[39:23] Lord. Amen. Praise God. Good to be here.
[39:30] [Music]
[39:32] Ethan, it's not easy to make you look
[39:34] average in
[39:36] size. Even Gideon don't quite pull it
[39:38] off, but somehow Daniel
[39:41] Wow, brother Daniel.
[39:44] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[39:47] We're going to invite you to Genesis
[39:49] chapter 12 this morning. Amen. Happy to
[39:53] have you all here in the house of the
[39:55] Lord. Amen. Sure. enjoying all of that
[39:58] wonderful singing and worship and uh and
[40:02] so brother Kenny had let me know that
[40:04] there was a little bit of extra layers
[40:06] of song specials today and I'm always
[40:08] for that and I promise you sister
[40:10] sweetheart is always for special
[40:12] singing. Amen. We love it. We can't
[40:14] hardly get enough of it. Sister Debbie
[40:16] and I we grew up loving good good
[40:19] singing. Praise the Lord. That when I
[40:21] when we had that birthday bash out where
[40:23] am I at? Out here. and uh and and shock
[40:27] of my life. I was so not expecting that
[40:30] as one of the best birthday presents
[40:31] I've ever had because it was all that
[40:33] singing and all that wonderful love and
[40:36] affection that we have. Isn't it
[40:37] wonderful to be part of the family of
[40:39] God? Amen.
[40:41] Amen. I truly love it. Amen. Genesis
[40:44] chapter 12. While we have you standing.
[40:47] Amen. We want to continue on today and
[40:50] part the third installment of uh our
[40:52] part in the
[40:54] inheritance. Amen. Now, we've been
[40:56] reading
[40:58] uh Genesis 15 and um I almost went there
[41:03] again today, but I've got material that
[41:05] I don't think I'm going to try to get to
[41:07] today unless the Lord changes me. Might
[41:09] get a little lengthy. And I I want to
[41:11] get to what I've got out here today. I
[41:13] believe it was inspired of God. And so,
[41:16] um, we we'll probably s save that for a
[41:19] fourth part. Amen. I believe we're
[41:21] scheduled to have the weapon with us
[41:23] preaching this Wednesday. Amen.
[41:26] Actually, we were supposed to have
[41:27] brother Burley last Wednesday and then
[41:28] he got tied up and couldn't come. So,
[41:31] uh, we were we were going to have two
[41:33] black
[41:34] supermen backto back on Wednesdays and
[41:36] brother Burley said, "Man, you owe us,
[41:39] Brother Burley, you owe us. You're going
[41:40] to have to reschedu that." And so, uh,
[41:43] but we'll have Brother Diggs here this
[41:45] Wednesday night. So, I know we always
[41:47] look forward to that. Amen. Praise Lord.
[41:50] That's why we call him the weapon.
[41:52] Amen. Amen. Genesis chapter 12 and then
[41:56] we're going to go from here to chapter
[41:58] 13 and then from there to Psalms 27. You
[42:01] love the Lord. Amen.
[42:05] Genesis 12, just the first three verses.
[42:08] Now the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get
[42:12] thee out of thy country, and from thy
[42:14] kindred, and from thy father's house
[42:17] unto a land that I will show thee, and I
[42:20] will make of thee a great nation." Now,
[42:22] this is the first time the Lord has
[42:24] approached him with this promise. You're
[42:28] going to remember, we're going to read
[42:30] the first two times in 12 and then
[42:33] chapter 13. And then we've been reading
[42:35] the third time was in chapter 15. But
[42:38] here we are in chapter 12 verse two
[42:40] again. And I will make of thee a great
[42:43] nation. And I will bless thee and make
[42:46] thy name great, and thou shalt be a
[42:50] blessing. And I will bless them that
[42:53] bless thee, and curse him that curse
[42:57] thee, and in thee shall all the families
[43:01] of the earth be blessed. You
[43:05] know, I mean, when you
[43:08] read what the Lord is saying he's going
[43:10] to do to and for and through Abraham,
[43:14] you come away with the sense of this has
[43:17] got to apply to something more than just
[43:19] a man in the land of that God just
[43:22] called on who who came from a family of
[43:25] heathen idol worshippers. And God just
[43:28] called him out of that. And now he gives
[43:30] him all this promise and I'm going to
[43:32] make your name great and you'll be a
[43:33] blessing. You're going to be a blessing
[43:36] and I'm going to bless everyone who
[43:37] blesses you and curse everyone who
[43:39] curses you. And in fact is Abram all the
[43:43] families of the earth are going to be
[43:44] blessed. This has got to be something
[43:47] more. I want you to know something
[43:48] friends. When the Bible says that the
[43:51] kingdoms of our Lord, the kingdoms of
[43:54] this world have become in the book of
[43:57] Revelation have become the kingdoms of
[43:59] our Lord and his Christ. And that Christ
[44:00] is his anointed family. It's Jesus and
[44:03] his bride, Mr. and Mrs. Jesus. It's got
[44:06] to be it's got to be more the kingdoms
[44:08] of this world becoming the kingdoms of
[44:10] our Lord and his Christ. It's got to be
[44:12] more than you're in my pitiful little
[44:14] life of ups and downs and ons and off.
[44:17] This got to be based on something way
[44:18] above us. Aren't you glad for that?
[44:22] You should take courage in that. Watch
[44:25] him come again. Verse chapter 13. Now
[44:27] he's separated from Lot. He's moving
[44:30] along further into the promise. You
[44:32] remember the principle that God spoke to
[44:37] Abraham only once and until Abraham
[44:41] obeyed, God didn't speak to him again.
[44:44] And when he obeyed, then God spoke
[44:46] again. And then when he obeyed, God
[44:48] spoke again. And that's the way God
[44:50] rolls. He'll tell you something in his
[44:53] word. When you do it, he'll give you the
[44:55] next step. And and a lot of times we sit
[44:58] down and throw dirt in the air and roll
[45:00] around on the ground. Why am I in this?
[45:01] And why is God letting this happen? And
[45:03] why won't he tell me something? You
[45:05] know, sometimes he's not he's not saying
[45:08] anything to you because he's already
[45:11] said it in his word and you already know
[45:13] it and he he already had you in a
[45:16] service and a preacher preached on it
[45:17] and you knew he had found you out and
[45:20] he's just waiting on you to go forward.
[45:22] I promise if you go forward, he'll go
[45:24] forward. Amen. Amen. And we're going to
[45:26] talk about that extensively today
[45:29] because forward is onward and onward
[45:33] equals upward. Amen. All right, you'll
[45:37] see what that means by and by. Let's
[45:39] catch it. Chapter
[45:42] 13. And the Lord uh verse 14. Chapter 13
[45:46] verse14.
[45:48] And the Lord said unto Abram after that,
[45:51] see, after that Lot was separated from
[45:53] him, because God told him, separate
[45:55] yourself, "Lift up now thine eyes, and
[45:59] look from the place where thou art
[46:01] northward, and southward, and eastward,
[46:04] and westward. For all the land which
[46:07] thou seeest, to thee will I give it, and
[46:11] to thy singular seed." Paul pointed that
[46:15] out to his Hebrew brethren. He didn't
[46:18] say
[46:18] seeds because not all Israel is Israel
[46:22] but to thy seed singular which had to be
[46:26] Christ. Now you're beginning to
[46:28] understand how all the earth will be
[46:29] blessed in Abraham because it's really a
[46:32] seedline of Christ. Amen. So the family
[46:36] of God is the seedline of Christ. Easy.
[46:41] Amen.
[46:43] And I verse 16. And I will make thy seed
[46:48] as the dust of the earth. So that if a
[46:51] man can number the dust of the earth,
[46:54] boy, try to do that. Then shall thy seed
[46:57] also be
[46:58] numbered. So he's he's he's creating an
[47:01] impossible situation.
[47:05] Arise, walk through the land in the
[47:08] length of it and in the breadth of it,
[47:10] for I will give it unto thee. Amen.
[47:14] Psalms
[47:17] 27. And now, we could have went on again
[47:20] and read from Genesis 15, but I I pretty
[47:23] feel pretty sure that'll be a fourth
[47:25] part. Uh Psalms 27, meaning I know it'll
[47:29] be a fourth part if we don't get to it
[47:30] today. meaning I don't think I I don't
[47:32] expect to get to it today and I'm not
[47:34] going to overly try. Psalms
[47:38] 27 verses
[47:41] 1-5. This is brother Brandham's text
[47:45] from of all sermons, one that's vi of
[47:49] vital interest to us, the rapture. Amen.
[47:52] I remember brother Eddie told me when he
[47:54] was listening to this service live over
[47:56] a
[47:57] hookup. He w he was puzzled because
[48:01] brother Brandham I think had announced
[48:02] I'm going to preach on the rapture. And
[48:04] when brother Brandham I mean you would
[48:06] think he'd have went to first
[48:07] Thessalonians 4. The Lord himself shall
[48:08] descend from heaven with shout. We which
[48:10] are alive and remain shall be. But he
[48:12] didn't. He went back to and brother
[48:14] brother he said I thought Psalms 27.
[48:18] Wait what? I thought we're talking about
[48:20] the
[48:21] rapture. But see, what the world wasn't
[48:24] understanding clearly is with the
[48:27] opening of the seven seals, we were no
[48:29] longer waiting on the rapture to begin.
[48:32] It had begun. What the world had not
[48:36] caught. Only Paul knew. And it wasn't it
[48:39] wasn't going to be known by experience.
[48:43] What Paul knew, he shall descend in a
[48:45] shout and a voice and a trumpet. That
[48:48] was the future day. Paul understood
[48:50] that. He wrote it like that. But it
[48:52] wouldn't be until the end time that a
[48:54] bride would actually learn it by living
[48:56] it. Oh wow. We are already in the cycle
[48:59] of the rapture. And the shout is the
[49:01] message. And the voice is a voice of a
[49:04] lived life. A life song that we are all
[49:06] singing.
[49:08] Amen. Yeah. I'm already preaching. I
[49:10] know you're standing.
[49:13] Don't Don't be a Don't be afraid. I'm
[49:15] fitting to close.
[49:19] But I I hey, you should be you should
[49:22] feel blessed because I I I heard a
[49:24] preacher one time talking about how he
[49:26] got doing this and and he left the
[49:29] people standing. He forgot to seat them
[49:31] and they were too courteous to seat sit
[49:32] on theirel and he preached for two hours
[49:34] and left them standing for God. So we're
[49:36] not going to do that. All right. But let
[49:39] let's let's keep let's keep uh let's
[49:41] read our our Psalms one or Psalms 27.
[49:47] The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[49:51] Whom shall I fear? See, so can I say
[49:55] that you're in the rapture cycle. Who
[49:57] are you going to be afraid of? You're
[49:58] already being lifted off of the earth.
[50:02] You're already say I don't feel Don't.
[50:06] It's not based on feelings. It's based
[50:08] on a promise. See, the Lord is the
[50:11] strength of my life. of whom shall I be
[50:15] afraid? When the wicked, even mine
[50:17] enemies and my foes, which would include
[50:19] the devil, right?
[50:23] Came upon me to eat up my flesh, they
[50:25] stumbled and fell. Though an host should
[50:28] encamp against me, all there's not
[50:31] enough demons in hell to keep you on
[50:33] this earth.
[50:36] Amen. Though a host should encamp
[50:38] against me, my heart shall not fear.
[50:41] though war should arise against me and
[50:45] how in this will I be confident one
[50:49] thing have I desired so he's confident
[50:52] he
[50:53] cannot base it on his victories he's
[50:57] basing it on the desire of his heart see
[51:02] in this one thing I will be confident
[51:04] that I have desired of the Lord whom
[51:08] I'll seek after this one thing will I be
[51:11] confident. One thing have I desired of
[51:13] the Lord that will I seek after that I
[51:16] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[51:18] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[51:21] of the Lord and to inquire in his
[51:23] temple. It's what we're doing today. For
[51:24] in the time of trouble, right? He shall
[51:27] hide me in his pavilion. Where is that?
[51:30] In the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[51:33] hide me. What made you a tabernacle? The
[51:35] Holy Ghost, the living presence of God.
[51:38] See? And so you're hid away. The devil
[51:40] can't get to you. And he shall set me
[51:42] upon a rock. You're setting upon a rock
[51:44] of revelation that you didn't give
[51:46] yourself. And you are impervious to
[51:49] Satan stopping you. Amen. Amen. Even you
[51:52] can't stop you. Aren't you glad?
[51:55] Man, I'm almost as glad for that one as
[51:57] that the devil can't stop me. Amen.
[52:00] Let's
[52:01] pray. Master, I thank you today for the
[52:04] anointing that I already feel. We thank
[52:07] you for this group of lovely people. We
[52:09] ask you to be with us now as we look
[52:11] into your word. We commit it to you in
[52:13] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you friends.
[52:16] You can be
[52:33] seated. Amen. So, I I I wanted to make
[52:39] those comments as we were reading the
[52:42] scripture
[52:43] verses because it's my desire
[52:47] today to align your thinking to my
[52:50] thinking. I'm really uh there's there's
[52:53] there's a number of points that I have
[52:56] made, am making, and will make in this
[53:00] little short series, three or four parts
[53:03] probably at best.
[53:05] And and the title should kick the whole
[53:08] thing off by in your minds by first
[53:12] there's an
[53:13] inheritance and then you have a part in
[53:16] it. So it's our part in the inheritance.
[53:20] We're not talking about the inheritance
[53:23] of somebody that we know that inherited
[53:26] a big estate of their previous
[53:28] generation. I'm telling you that there
[53:30] is an inheritance far greater than any
[53:34] inheritance that's ever existed in the
[53:36] earth. And guess what? Tag, you're it.
[53:41] You're you're involved in that. And you
[53:44] are you are here today hearing the
[53:48] reading of the will. You've been hearing
[53:51] it in part one, part two. You're hearing
[53:54] it again today. there's more that we'll
[53:56] get to hear because and and and let me
[53:59] just say this that I'm definitely for
[54:02] sure positive and absolute that you're
[54:06] not here to just hear that you have are
[54:10] part of the greatest inheritance to ever
[54:12] to be known. I'm here to instruct you
[54:16] how to get your inheritance.
[54:20] How do I become a part of it? See,
[54:24] because this isn't an attorney's office
[54:27] that you're going to go sit in and uh a
[54:30] number with a lot of zeros are going to
[54:31] hit your bank account. Your bank account
[54:33] might be negative by Monday, but I'm
[54:36] here to tell you that has no bearing on
[54:38] what I'm talking about because the
[54:41] kingdoms of this world will become and
[54:44] are becoming the kingdoms of our Lord
[54:47] and his Christ. And I I'm in that
[54:51] number. Amen.
[54:53] that glorious
[54:55] bloodwashed
[54:58] number. Brother Brandham comes with this
[55:01] quote here from the rapture. Now, it's
[55:04] familiar to you. Brother Brandham has
[55:07] told it a number of times. There's other
[55:10] that I could have used today, but
[55:12] because of a one specific line in this
[55:14] one, this is the last time that I
[55:17] believe or at least one of the last
[55:19] times that he tells it. And it's it's
[55:21] late. It's in December 65. He's only
[55:25] He's less than a month away from going
[55:27] home and being removed from us far
[55:31] sooner than any of us thought or
[55:33] expected or hoped. But it was all in
[55:35] God's plan. And we can see that now. Uh
[55:39] there's no way to put in words the
[55:42] bewilderment Sister Jean felt
[55:45] when she was a young woman hearing a
[55:47] prophet has gone home that nobody
[55:49] expected. But but but now here we are
[55:52] decades later and she gets it. We get
[55:55] it. We understand it. It was a necessary
[55:58] move on God because we couldn't keep
[56:00] relying on a man. Nobody can do this for
[56:03] you. What Jesus has already done. It's
[56:06] up to you to get to it yourself.
[56:11] Amen. So here he goes. He's telling the
[56:15] vision of the preview of the bride. Now
[56:18] catch that. Underline it. preview of the
[56:20] bride.
[56:22] All right, I'll say more on that in a
[56:24] moment. So, here's one of the times he
[56:27] tells about it. You remember that it's
[56:30] and I I've cut it as short as I could.
[56:32] Didn't tell the everything because he's
[56:34] told about how that he was caught away
[56:36] in a vision and he saw the preview of
[56:40] the church going by and it was lovely
[56:42] and it was wonderful and brother
[56:44] Brandham was thrilled to see it. All
[56:46] right. But now now next he hears
[56:50] something coming and now he's he's
[56:52] getting a preview of the church. And now
[56:56] now to the world that seems
[57:00] um like what do you mean the the bride
[57:04] versus the church? I thought
[57:07] the church was the bride. I thought the
[57:11] bride is part of the church. that is was
[57:14] absolutely true until you get to the
[57:18] last age and not just the the front part
[57:21] of the last age because that's up to the
[57:24] seals.
[57:25] Brother Brandham said in many respects,
[57:27] in some respects is just an extension of
[57:29] Philadelphia because of the open door
[57:32] that was set at the end of the age in
[57:33] that in that fading out and that handoff
[57:36] like an Olympic uh relay race where
[57:40] they're both running at the same time
[57:42] handing the baton and so and then
[57:45] finally Philadelphia fades out that
[57:47] early Leot and age runs on and people
[57:49] sometimes get that all confused because
[57:52] they're they're they don't understand
[57:54] the difference between the third between
[57:56] the third stage of the restoration of
[58:00] the bride tree and the fourth stage. Now
[58:03] there's and because they confuse that
[58:05] and they conflate three works of grace.
[58:07] How do I get three works of grace? But
[58:09] I've got don't don't don't jam those
[58:12] together. There's there's only three
[58:13] works of grace. God works in perfect
[58:16] threes. But but the bride was taken down
[58:19] in four stages and would be restored in
[58:22] four stages. And there was a third stage
[58:25] that that is now going to begin with the
[58:28] open door, which is a revelation of the
[58:30] deity of Christ. And I'm going to deal
[58:32] with this in a prophecy series I'm been
[58:34] working on. I think you'll enjoy it
[58:36] quite well. We want to take modern
[58:38] events, modern events of the last
[58:41] century and modern events uh in our day
[58:44] and future events that are soon to be
[58:46] upon us. And uh we want to overlay that
[58:49] with prophecy. So, we'll get to that.
[58:51] But, but let me just say that but now
[58:54] we're we're coming up to the time where
[58:57] for the first time the whole world is
[59:01] going to go in darkness and gross
[59:04] darkness. The people not not the likes
[59:06] of which have not been seen since the
[59:08] days of Noah. Amen. And so, this is why
[59:11] Jesus would say as it was in the days of
[59:14] Noah. As it was in the days of Lot. And
[59:17] it's notable that he didn't say as it
[59:19] was in the days of Abraham or as it was
[59:22] in the days of Enoch because we're
[59:25] talking about the condition of the
[59:26] world. The world had gone dark and had
[59:29] gone mad and gross darkness was upon the
[59:33] uh the all the people and it became a
[59:36] neurotic age and it got to a point where
[59:38] the church uh I I I want you to think
[59:41] about this for a moment and I I may have
[59:44] said this Wednesday night. I don't
[59:46] remember if I've said it yet or not.
[59:48] I'll just say it again. Perhaps I
[59:49] haven't said it. But when you when you
[59:53] realize that the that the church that
[59:58] the that what had been something God had
[1:00:01] been working in through seven church
[1:00:05] ages, that that church would eventually
[1:00:08] put Christ out. Amen. and that church
[1:00:11] would
[1:00:12] die and it would never rise again. It
[1:00:16] could not go in the rapture and it
[1:00:18] couldn't get any better. And so God like
[1:00:22] he called a nation out of a nation like
[1:00:24] he called Israel out of Egypt. He called
[1:00:28] the bride out of the church. Come out of
[1:00:31] her. A church is a her. Come out of her
[1:00:34] my people. So, it's obvious that the
[1:00:37] church as a whole were not all his
[1:00:40] people, but he's calling his people out
[1:00:43] of a people who are not his people. They
[1:00:47] have a name, but they are dead. The
[1:00:49] Bible says you have a name like you're
[1:00:51] alive, but you're not actually you're
[1:00:52] dead. And the and the the grave marker
[1:00:56] of the Leodysian church was I am that if
[1:01:01] you go to see the grave marker, the
[1:01:03] tombstone of the Leodysian church, it's
[1:01:06] Revelation 3 14- 20 through through 20.
[1:01:10] I I am rich and increased with goods. I
[1:01:12] have need of nothing. Knowest thou not
[1:01:15] that thou art poor, miserable, blind,
[1:01:16] and naked. See, and by the time you get
[1:01:20] to Revelation
[1:01:22] 22, you've got a bride speaking in the
[1:01:26] unified voice with Christ. The spirit
[1:01:28] and the bride say, "Come." How did you
[1:01:32] get from a dead to church with a
[1:01:34] tombstone of Revelation 3 to a bride of
[1:01:38] Revelation 22? The spirit and the bride
[1:01:40] said, "Come." I'm here to tell you, if
[1:01:42] you want to be called up, you better be
[1:01:44] willing to be called out. Because if you
[1:01:47] don't hear come out, you will never hear
[1:01:49] come up. Full stop. That's it. You'll
[1:01:52] never hear come
[1:01:54] up if you don't first hear come out.
[1:01:59] Not in this age. Not in this age. This
[1:02:02] is a unique age in many respects from
[1:02:04] all previous ages.
[1:02:07] So now he's he's he's already seen a
[1:02:11] redeemed church. Now he's standing and
[1:02:14] he hears another one. Oh, it's like a
[1:02:16] parade. It's like a procession going
[1:02:17] past him and he's in the stand. And the
[1:02:20] Lord is standing there with him and
[1:02:22] they're watching. And now he comes to
[1:02:24] this second time. It's going to come and
[1:02:26] watch this
[1:02:28] now. I heard it coming up. The church is
[1:02:32] coming up from this other
[1:02:35] side. There come the Asian church. Oh,
[1:02:38] you talk about filth. See, it's not the
[1:02:41] bride. Here come the European church. Oh
[1:02:44] my. And then I heard a rock and roll
[1:02:47] coming. And it was Miss America, the
[1:02:50] church. And she didn't even have any clo
[1:02:55] have on any clothes.
[1:02:58] She had papers like newspapers, gray. He
[1:03:01] called it another time like
[1:03:03] paperiermâché. We remember that from our
[1:03:05] art class in grade school. And this gray
[1:03:08] holding in front of her dancing by rock
[1:03:12] and roll Miss America the church. I
[1:03:16] stood there in his presence. I thought,
[1:03:19] "Oh, God, as a minister, if that's the
[1:03:23] best we could do, oh, oh, you know how
[1:03:26] you feel." Then I thought, "God, hide
[1:03:29] me. If I could just get away from here.
[1:03:33] If all that we've done, and that's what
[1:03:38] we have to produce. If that's what" And
[1:03:41] he trails off. And then when them women
[1:03:44] pass by all doing all kinds of rocks and
[1:03:49] things and short hair and painted faces.
[1:03:54] A and as they you can see why brother
[1:03:57] Brandon preached against those kinds of
[1:03:58] things because this is what God showed
[1:04:00] him was a condition of the fallen
[1:04:03] church. Short hair and painted faces.
[1:04:06] And as they pass by like that, supposed
[1:04:09] to be supposed to be
[1:04:12] supposed to be. You have a name that
[1:04:15] you're alive, but you're dead. You call
[1:04:17] yourself Christian. You do have a form
[1:04:19] of godliness, but you really deny the
[1:04:22] living power to change your life.
[1:04:28] And he
[1:04:29] says supposed to be virgins to Christ.
[1:04:35] Remember Matthew 25 virgins because
[1:04:38] remember both the wise and the unwise
[1:04:40] were virgins. Don't ever don't ever
[1:04:43] associate the unwise virgins with the
[1:04:46] harlot daughters of Revelation. They're
[1:04:48] virgins. They're just don't have the
[1:04:50] oil. They're just not born again. But
[1:04:52] they do have a testimony of Christ. But
[1:04:54] they're righteous people. Get it? The
[1:04:57] king called them righteous in the book
[1:04:59] of Revelation. They're called saints.
[1:05:02] Saint means sanctified one. So although
[1:05:05] they're not born again, they will gain
[1:05:07] eternal life at the judgment. But they
[1:05:09] lived as as sanctified
[1:05:11] people. So don't confuse that with the
[1:05:14] Tommy rot of Christianity you see today
[1:05:16] portrayed as Christianity is nothing of
[1:05:18] the kind. It's a social gospel only.
[1:05:22] God's able to call them out of that just
[1:05:24] like he called me and you out of it. I'm
[1:05:26] glad there's still mercy and we should
[1:05:29] still keep preaching and you should
[1:05:30] still keep living it and we should still
[1:05:32] keep praying and we should still keep
[1:05:35] reaching to the lost. We should still
[1:05:37] keep reaching to those people trapped in
[1:05:40] that cuz many of them are innocent
[1:05:41] people who have been misled by
[1:05:43] misinterpreted theology. And if they
[1:05:45] would ever if they would ever hear the
[1:05:48] word or better yet see the word in a
[1:05:51] bride, they might go, "Wow, you got
[1:05:53] something I'm missing. Tell me. Tell
[1:05:55] me." And you should always be ready to
[1:05:57] give an account of the faith that you
[1:05:59] believe.
[1:06:04] So he they're supposed to be
[1:06:07] virgins to
[1:06:16] Christ. Excuse me. Oh, here we go.
[1:06:20] And
[1:06:20] when she passed by like
[1:06:24] that, I turned my head, you know, with
[1:06:27] this holding in front of me. It was
[1:06:29] disgraceful. The back of them and and
[1:06:32] there they was going going like
[1:06:36] that. Sure, Lord, I will. You know,
[1:06:40] sisters, it's not just the front of your
[1:06:42] clothing that should stay decent.
[1:06:45] The back of your clothing should also
[1:06:47] have a decency to it. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:51] I was That's not in my notes,
[1:06:53] but that's where somebody taps me on the
[1:06:55] shoulder and says, "Here's a spot. Say
[1:06:57] it." Not just the front of your clothing
[1:07:00] should keep you covered decent, but the
[1:07:02] back of your clothing should keep you
[1:07:04] covered and
[1:07:06] decent. Did you know that psychologist
[1:07:09] and I read this report myself? I read
[1:07:12] this. This is not William Brandom. This
[1:07:14] is not We're not talking about that.
[1:07:15] Don't go, "Oh, there goes that that
[1:07:17] random guy again." No. I read a a
[1:07:20] sociology report and that that they
[1:07:23] pulled just average men. And do you know
[1:07:27] what was overwhelming? Above the 90
[1:07:30] percentile of the thing that allured men
[1:07:33] the most was a woman's bare shoulders.
[1:07:39] Don't I guess I've locked everybody up.
[1:07:45] You should you should your your body is
[1:07:47] sacred, sister. You should keep it
[1:07:50] covered. Amen. You should never present
[1:07:52] yourself in such a way that you're
[1:07:54] exposing
[1:07:56] uh flesh like that. That's ungodly.
[1:07:58] That's not even a sanctified lifestyle.
[1:08:01] It's embarrassing to everyone. So, so uh
[1:08:04] and hey, you know, I I I I let me just
[1:08:08] say while I'm on it, you know, while
[1:08:10] while I'm on it, because I hate coming
[1:08:12] to it. So, let me say it while I'm on
[1:08:13] it, then I can move
[1:08:15] on. I'm glad this is at the beginning.
[1:08:17] But, you know, I was I saw a real the
[1:08:19] other day of a Baptist preacher and he
[1:08:22] he's holding his Bible and I I wanted to
[1:08:24] send the guy I think Caleb or some Brad
[1:08:27] or somebody posted it in our ministers
[1:08:29] chat and he was just a a sassifrass
[1:08:32] Baptist preacher. You could tell he
[1:08:34] wasn't one of these fancy doctors of
[1:08:36] divinity and he said, "I'm just going to
[1:08:37] go ahead and say it." He said, "Howdy
[1:08:40] some of you boys." He said, 'You're
[1:08:42] sitting in a Baptist church reading from
[1:08:44] a King James Bible and you got hair that
[1:08:47] looks like a Hollywood
[1:08:49] idol. And he said, ' Go get yourself a
[1:08:52] haircut, young man. You're supposed to
[1:08:54] represent Jesus Christ. And that's a
[1:08:56] Baptist church. How ought we, you young
[1:09:00] men, you brothers, you ladies, come on,
[1:09:02] friends. Come on. Come on. Let's Let's
[1:09:04] own this today. God calls us to
[1:09:08] holiness. I don't want to be part of
[1:09:10] what the prophet is seeing
[1:09:13] here. Okay, sir. Can I move
[1:09:19] on? So he
[1:09:21] says, "And when she passed by like
[1:09:25] that, I turned my head, you know, with
[1:09:28] this holding in front of me, it was
[1:09:31] disgraceful, the back of them." And
[1:09:33] there they was going like that. And I
[1:09:35] turned my head to weeping like that. I
[1:09:37] said I couldn't stand it in there. Him
[1:09:40] standing there and me know that me a
[1:09:43] minister of the of the church and that's
[1:09:47] what I had produced for him. I said, "Oh
[1:09:48] God, I can't look at it. Let me die. Let
[1:09:51] me fade
[1:09:54] away." And as soon as it went out, every
[1:09:57] time one of them would come, they'd
[1:09:59] come. Now, catch this. All right. Now,
[1:10:01] listen. This is this is where I real
[1:10:03] details.
[1:10:05] They would uh and and as soon as it went
[1:10:07] out every time, every time one of them
[1:10:11] would come, they'd go out to a certain
[1:10:15] place, then drop off. I just hear the
[1:10:19] sound of it as they went away. So,
[1:10:20] they've come to like a cliff and they
[1:10:22] have plunged into an abyss. Brother
[1:10:24] Brandham describes it in a in another
[1:10:26] time. He said, "All of the most horrible
[1:10:30] screams you've ever heard as those girls
[1:10:34] plunged down." And and he said, "As they
[1:10:37] plunged
[1:10:38] down." So he said, "And and the sound of
[1:10:43] it as it went away." Oh, I'm so glad it
[1:10:46] didn't end there.
[1:10:49] Then then everybody say then. Then then
[1:10:53] I heard something cuz brother Brandham
[1:10:55] realized the the the true church had to
[1:10:58] come back in preview again. Not just the
[1:11:00] alpha church but the omega church. Then
[1:11:03] I heard something like onward Christian
[1:11:07] soldiers. I looked and here come that
[1:11:10] sainted bunch of little girls just
[1:11:12] exactly the way they was. All correctly
[1:11:16] dressed, their hair hanging way down on
[1:11:18] their back, smooth, smooth, clean,
[1:11:22] marching like this. And this is
[1:11:24] important. Marching to the step. Amen.
[1:11:28] To the step of the gospel. See, she was
[1:11:34] the word. How do you get in the step of
[1:11:35] the gospel? Become the word. What is it
[1:11:38] when you become the word? Are you
[1:11:41] indoctrinated? No. You're marching in
[1:11:43] step to the gospel.
[1:11:46] See, so the gospel is not doctrine.
[1:11:49] Doctrine is within the gospel. But the
[1:11:52] gospel is he lives. And because he
[1:11:55] lives, I can live also. See, it's the
[1:11:58] good
[1:12:00] news. Smooth, clean, marching like this
[1:12:02] to the step of the gospel. She was the
[1:12:05] word. They look like one out of every
[1:12:08] nation. I was looking at it as they
[1:12:11] passed by and seen them pass by. Now,
[1:12:14] here's another important line. Instead
[1:12:16] of going down, they started going up.
[1:12:20] Hallelujah.
[1:12:23] Come on. So, now you've you've got a
[1:12:26] contrast. The church is going down. The
[1:12:30] bride is going up.
[1:12:33] Nobody's staying in the middle.
[1:12:36] That's not where this is a
[1:12:39] procession. This is moving. I've been
[1:12:41] preaching to you about moving forward in
[1:12:44] your faith. This is not about standing
[1:12:46] still. I you know, if you're not going
[1:12:51] forward in your faith and growing, then
[1:12:56] you're not going onward. Right? And if
[1:12:59] like onward Christian soldiers and if
[1:13:02] you're not going onward Christian
[1:13:04] soldiers, then you're not going upward.
[1:13:09] Onward equals upward. I could write it
[1:13:12] like an equation today. Onward equals
[1:13:15] upward.
[1:13:18] Forward is onward.
[1:13:22] I don't want to get ahead of myself. You
[1:13:25] can tell I'm methodical. I'm going slow
[1:13:27] today. That's why I promised you I'm not
[1:13:28] even going to attempt to get to that
[1:13:30] fourth part because I don't want to uh
[1:13:32] take it too long and wear you
[1:13:35] out. So, but instead of going down, they
[1:13:40] started going up. Why? Because they were
[1:13:42] marching to the step of the gospel. They
[1:13:45] were going onward. They were going
[1:13:46] forward. See, I noticed now this so
[1:13:50] encouraged me. I noticed one of them
[1:13:53] trying two or three of them. I'm
[1:13:55] probably equal. All three of them of
[1:13:57] them trying getting out of line. I
[1:14:02] screamed, "Stay in line." And the vision
[1:14:05] left me and I was standing in the room
[1:14:07] screaming, "Stay in line." You say,
[1:14:10] "That's that it that vision ended
[1:14:12] dreadfully." Not to me, it didn't. To
[1:14:15] me, it ended that even though we get out
[1:14:17] of step, sometimes we've had missteps,
[1:14:20] but it didn't stop her from going up
[1:14:22] because she kept going on. I've had
[1:14:25] missteps, but I'm going on. Sometimes
[1:14:28] I've stumbled, but I get back up. Here's
[1:14:30] what it is. I'm going forward.
[1:14:37] Wow.
[1:14:40] Sometimes I feel like brother Dale is
[1:14:41] going to walk out and blow
[1:14:43] up. It's too
[1:14:45] big. Me and Brother Dale, we've laughed
[1:14:47] so many times over the years. He'll
[1:14:49] he'll be telling me because you get him
[1:14:51] you get him on the phone he's gonna
[1:14:52] start preaching you what he just
[1:14:53] preached and so we get it we get started
[1:14:55] started and I said was it too big he
[1:14:57] goes yeah brother it was too big I about
[1:14:59] blew
[1:15:01] up onward equals
[1:15:06] upward that's uh that's all I should
[1:15:08] have of of the powerpoint brother
[1:15:13] Mark
[1:15:14] so so if you're not going forward in
[1:15:18] your experience you're not going upward.
[1:15:20] Plain and simple.
[1:15:23] Wow. The essence of moving onward and
[1:15:27] upward. That is what I'm labeling to you
[1:15:30] today as true progression, spiritual
[1:15:35] progression. There's no way to claim
[1:15:39] spiritual progression if you're not
[1:15:41] going forward. Amen. If you've allowed
[1:15:44] whatever, if you've allowed the world,
[1:15:47] if you've allowed friends, if you've
[1:15:49] allowed money, women, popularity, if
[1:15:51] you've allowed a career, if you've
[1:15:52] allowed school, if you've allowed
[1:15:54] anything, nothing wrong with a career in
[1:15:56] school and having friends. But if you've
[1:15:58] allowed any of those things to sidetrack
[1:16:01] you from going forward in Christ, you're
[1:16:04] in a bad place.
[1:16:07] See, if you're not going forward in
[1:16:10] spiritual health, I don't say, please
[1:16:15] hear
[1:16:15] me, because there's there's people in
[1:16:18] here today that love the Lord.
[1:16:22] Absolutely.
[1:16:23] Do believe the word for sure. I'm not
[1:16:28] here questioning and judging somebody's
[1:16:30] experience or what they believe in their
[1:16:32] heart. I'm believing everybody in here
[1:16:34] is a believer. You wouldn't come here to
[1:16:36] man scream at you and whail and yell and
[1:16:38] wave his arms and turn red in the face.
[1:16:40] There's no way anybody would do that.
[1:16:42] So, I know that there's a a desire for
[1:16:44] you. You came here cuz you wanted to
[1:16:46] come here cuz nobody could make most of
[1:16:48] you come. But, you know, and and I'm
[1:16:51] always aware of that when people come to
[1:16:53] the altar. And I'll say, Lord, nobody
[1:16:55] could compel these people. You brought
[1:16:57] them up here. See? And so so so we we
[1:17:00] you realize then that I'm not here
[1:17:03] saying that you're not a believer that
[1:17:05] you haven't had an experience in Christ.
[1:17:07] I'm simply trying to say and I'm not and
[1:17:10] so therefore
[1:17:11] therefore if you're not going forward
[1:17:14] and upward but I'm not saying you're
[1:17:17] falling into the abyss either. I accept
[1:17:20] that you're a real believer. I'm I'm
[1:17:23] going to say to you as I've just said
[1:17:25] there's no middle ground in this vision.
[1:17:28] And the reason I say that is because
[1:17:30] sometimes people live in a quasi no
[1:17:34] man's land middle ground believers God's
[1:17:36] family. But the point is according to
[1:17:40] the vision, you're not supposed to live
[1:17:42] there. Amen. Amen. You remember brother
[1:17:46] Matt when he preached on on on on
[1:17:49] on judges and how Ruth was the answer to
[1:17:52] Judges and that was such a profound
[1:17:54] sermon. and I've never it's always
[1:17:55] affected me. And and brother Matt talked
[1:17:58] about sometimes, you know, you get in a
[1:18:00] traffic circle and sometimes people's
[1:18:04] lives,
[1:18:05] believers look like they're in a
[1:18:08] spiritual traffic circle. Yeah. They're
[1:18:11] not really going back the way they came.
[1:18:13] They're not backsliding, but neither are
[1:18:15] they going on. They're just going around
[1:18:17] and around. Amen. And and and brother
[1:18:20] Matt pointed out to us the whole thing
[1:18:21] is traffic circles aren't built to drive
[1:18:24] in. They're built to drive through and
[1:18:25] on. Drive out of it and go forward. See?
[1:18:31] And sometimes people drive in that thing
[1:18:33] for years. I've seen them drive around
[1:18:34] in it for decades and they never get
[1:18:38] anywhere. They haven't backslid. They
[1:18:40] didn't go back into the world. But
[1:18:42] neither is their life. Their life
[1:18:44] doesn't appear to be very much in the
[1:18:46] order of ascension. Amen. You're stuck
[1:18:49] in a traffic circle going around and
[1:18:51] around. And so, you know, um the you
[1:18:54] know the when you do that, as brother
[1:18:56] Matt was showing there in the book of
[1:18:58] Judges, I mean, the best that you have
[1:19:01] as a believer, come on. The best you
[1:19:04] have is a is a life of service to the
[1:19:07] Lord in that death and revival cycle.
[1:19:10] Death, revival, death, revival, death,
[1:19:13] revival, death. And you're just up and
[1:19:15] down. And you're revived, then you're
[1:19:16] not. Then you're revived, then you're
[1:19:17] not. Then you're a meeting, you're good,
[1:19:19] then the meeting's over, then you're
[1:19:20] not. See, you sit in a church, the word
[1:19:22] convicts you, run good for a while, you
[1:19:24] cool back off, go right back to going
[1:19:26] around in the circle. You never drove
[1:19:28] out of it. See? And so it it it but but
[1:19:30] but Ruth was the answer to Judges
[1:19:34] because Ruth brought Boaz on the scene
[1:19:36] who married oh brought who married Ruth
[1:19:40] and she became his bride. And so, so the
[1:19:43] whole the whole thing is that God was
[1:19:46] going to introduce a life into the world
[1:19:50] that that didn't continue, you know,
[1:19:52] death and revival, death and revival. It
[1:19:54] would be life eternal, perpetual,
[1:19:57] upward, upward, upward, upward, upward.
[1:20:00] God was going to introduce a kind of
[1:20:02] life into the world that only drove in
[1:20:04] one direction, forward and onward. And
[1:20:08] onward means upward. Amen. Amen. He's
[1:20:13] going to send us a driver that didn't
[1:20:15] drive like
[1:20:16] that.
[1:20:19] Amen. And he was going
[1:20:21] to he was going to he was going to give
[1:20:25] his driving characteristics to you so
[1:20:27] you could drive
[1:20:29] better. So if you see brother Jason
[1:20:32] driving his chariot furiously like Jahu,
[1:20:36] just remember it's just have mercy and
[1:20:39] pray for me. Amen.
[1:20:42] I I'm trying to I'm trying to drive like
[1:20:44] a different
[1:20:47] driver. God has a family in the world
[1:20:53] um who are
[1:20:55] here whose purpose for being here and
[1:21:00] their whole experience of life has been
[1:21:02] designed to be a light to a dark world.
[1:21:06] Amen.
[1:21:07] Now, I I'm not here
[1:21:09] to, you know,
[1:21:12] um, you know, psychoanalysis, do a
[1:21:15] psycho psychoanalysis of your past life.
[1:21:18] I'm not even qualified to do that. Don't
[1:21:20] care to be qualified to do it. I can do
[1:21:22] it by the word of
[1:21:23] God. And but I can't answer everything
[1:21:27] of why, what happened to you, when,
[1:21:29] where, and how, and whose fault it was,
[1:21:31] and what's Can I just say to you, what
[1:21:33] about now? Yeah, I get that that was
[1:21:36] then and then might have been very
[1:21:38] painful. But what about now?
[1:21:41] Because you can hide behind it all day
[1:21:43] long and and and I'm not saying it's not
[1:21:45] real pain or real disappointment. Why'
[1:21:47] this happen? Why did God let you know? I
[1:21:50] here's all I know. Here's all I can say
[1:21:52] is that God put me here for a reason.
[1:21:55] He's accomplishing a plan. The footsteps
[1:21:58] of the righteous ordered of God. I
[1:22:00] didn't always make the right choice, but
[1:22:02] he kept with me. Sometimes I went off
[1:22:04] the trail, but he kept bringing me back.
[1:22:06] And here I stand today. I'm back on the
[1:22:08] trail. I haven't always been here, but
[1:22:10] I'm very glad today that I am.
[1:22:14] Amen. He has a family in the world who
[1:22:17] are supposed to be a shining light to
[1:22:19] the world
[1:22:21] uh of this new life, a light, a shining
[1:22:25] light of the gospel. But
[1:22:28] sometimes sometimes and I I'm just so
[1:22:32] glad he's allowed me to say it like this
[1:22:34] so that so that you can't, you know,
[1:22:37] rubber stamp me as just a judge
[1:22:38] judgmental hateful preacher like they
[1:22:41] did Paul like they did every every real
[1:22:43] servant of God.
[1:22:45] So, so he allowed me to say, "But
[1:22:48] sometimes his
[1:22:51] family." So now you can't hate on me
[1:22:54] because I'm calling you his family. Say,
[1:22:57] "How do you know that what you're about
[1:23:00] to say is true? I've lived it." Yeah.
[1:23:03] Amen. I read it. There's other ones in
[1:23:06] the Bible who did what I'm about to say.
[1:23:08] Who were God's family? I'm
[1:23:12] trying to help you. That's right. Amen.
[1:23:15] Okay.
[1:23:19] Sometimes this
[1:23:21] family that God has put on a path to be
[1:23:25] a light to the world, sometimes his own
[1:23:28] family uh veers off the path that he has
[1:23:31] laid out for them. It happens.
[1:23:35] They do it to perhaps to find what they
[1:23:38] think maybe is a a better way to
[1:23:41] happiness in this world. What a sad
[1:23:45] multitude of wasted time and
[1:23:50] opportunities that we squander because
[1:23:53] we do
[1:23:54] that that we veer off the path God
[1:23:57] ordained because we feel that we have
[1:24:01] found a better way to happiness in this
[1:24:04] world. And it's just uh it creates a lot
[1:24:07] of wasted opportunities and a lot of
[1:24:09] wasted time. I can tell you that I once
[1:24:11] was young, now I'm
[1:24:13] older. And I can tell you that wasted
[1:24:16] opportunities to serve God and to
[1:24:18] accomplish things for his kingdom weighs
[1:24:20] on you.
[1:24:23] Uh but I but but but I don't want to
[1:24:26] leave you with with
[1:24:28] doom. Let me let me tell you this. God
[1:24:32] has a way. He God has ways. Many ways.
[1:24:36] And he will, has, will, and always shall
[1:24:40] get his family back on, Amen. the path
[1:24:45] he ordained. Amen.
[1:24:47] But to get back on the correct
[1:24:51] trail, God's family sometimes spend a
[1:24:54] lot of time doubling back
[1:24:56] around, you know, cuz they went off
[1:24:58] trail. They went off the path that God
[1:25:00] had. And so they, you know, they got to
[1:25:03] double back around or or at best, you
[1:25:05] know, they they try to they realize I'm
[1:25:07] off the path. I got to I'm just going to
[1:25:09] I don't want to go all the way back, so
[1:25:10] I'm just going to cut through. I know
[1:25:11] it's right above me. I'm going cut
[1:25:13] through. And then you end up having to
[1:25:15] crash through through bramble and briars
[1:25:18] and rocks and and you get torn up, cut
[1:25:20] up, scraped up. I see people and they're
[1:25:23] bleeding and they're they're standing on
[1:25:25] God's trail and and I can see that their
[1:25:28] life is standing on his trail, but
[1:25:29] they're bleeding profusely and I know
[1:25:31] you got off that trail, didn't you?
[1:25:35] Well, come here. Come here. I got some
[1:25:37] bomb and Gilead. We'll put it on those
[1:25:39] wounds. You come on around. We'll
[1:25:41] bandage you up. will preach to you. I'm
[1:25:43] a healer. That's what I do. That's what
[1:25:45] pastors do. They're they're the medic in
[1:25:48] in the in God's army. That's what they
[1:25:50] do. They they run along with you. They
[1:25:52] run beside you in life. Pastors are
[1:25:55] uniquely qualified to reach over in real
[1:25:57] time while they're running alongside you
[1:25:59] and stitch the things of God into you
[1:26:01] and take things away. You don't even
[1:26:02] know they took it and and make you run a
[1:26:04] little lighter and a little faster.
[1:26:06] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:26:10] So we find that there is a rhythm of the
[1:26:13] word for your life that does not involve
[1:26:17] leaving the trail and having to cut
[1:26:19] through and crash through
[1:26:21] bramble the mu and if and if you ever
[1:26:23] know about real masterpiece of music it
[1:26:27] it swells and it it or let me let me it
[1:26:30] has those moments and crescendos and
[1:26:32] everything but let me just say more more
[1:26:34] than swells I want to use this word it
[1:26:36] builds amen it's it's building to
[1:26:39] something where he's ending is not where
[1:26:40] he starts. And he and he and he's and
[1:26:43] sometimes it'll ramp up and then fall
[1:26:45] back and then it'll go forward and fall
[1:26:47] back. But it's it's going somewhere. I
[1:26:49] know your life can sometimes look like
[1:26:51] forward and then not so forward, faster
[1:26:53] and then not so fast. But just leave God
[1:26:56] in control. Whatever you do, leave him
[1:26:59] in control.
[1:27:02] You know, our our own um Sister Ruth
[1:27:05] Simmons, trained in trained classically
[1:27:07] in music, knows that that you can't sit
[1:27:10] down with the sheet music in front of
[1:27:12] you and go off the trail. You're not
[1:27:14] going to play what the master wrote.
[1:27:17] See? Amen. So, the music, you know, it
[1:27:20] it it builds by design. It takes on a a
[1:27:24] life o of its own. And that's how it
[1:27:26] does within your life. Remember, Brother
[1:27:27] Brandham said, "It's so beautiful. You
[1:27:29] can close your eyes and live in it.
[1:27:31] That's how real it is. Because music
[1:27:34] predates creation. There was music and
[1:27:36] worship long before he ever built the
[1:27:38] earth. And so so and Satan was the was
[1:27:42] the was the worship leader. That's why
[1:27:44] we have to be careful in our music. See,
[1:27:46] we have we have to be studious. We have
[1:27:48] to stay in prayer. We have to our our
[1:27:50] music leaders and musicians have to stay
[1:27:52] anointed. See? And and so so we realize
[1:27:56] that music moves you. It's why you hear
[1:27:59] it and your toe starts moving
[1:28:00] involuntarily. Your hand your fingers
[1:28:02] start tapping. Next, I mean, you can be
[1:28:04] in a in a in a in a not so great mood at
[1:28:07] a not so great place. Just put on the
[1:28:10] right worship music and in seconds
[1:28:13] you'll be swept away to somewhere.
[1:28:15] Hallelujah. Amen. It's very real. It's
[1:28:18] not a figment of your imagination. But
[1:28:21] you understand that God writes sheet
[1:28:23] music for your life and that this life
[1:28:26] and that this sheet music is
[1:28:28] building. It's building you into
[1:28:30] something within your life. It begins to
[1:28:33] replicate the melody and the life song
[1:28:36] that your creator intended for you.
[1:28:40] Remember I said Wednesday he wants to
[1:28:42] hear his sheet music played back to him
[1:28:45] in your life.
[1:28:47] See, you don't have to be talented or
[1:28:49] gifted. You just need to be called and
[1:28:51] chosen. Amen. And you can play your life
[1:28:55] song becomes a melody of his word played
[1:28:58] back to him. It is through and I've said
[1:29:00] this to you over and over and over again
[1:29:02] in this series. It is through the active
[1:29:04] faith and obedience to the
[1:29:06] word that we get into the rhythm of the
[1:29:10] word. And daily we build on the music.
[1:29:14] And not only that, but it but it's also
[1:29:18] how you
[1:29:20] find the the correct beat of the age
[1:29:24] you're in. Amen. Because you you're if
[1:29:26] you don't have the beat, you might be in
[1:29:29] the right key. You might be playing the
[1:29:32] notes, but you're not in the right
[1:29:35] timing. You know, men who love greasing
[1:29:38] gears understand that about combustion
[1:29:40] engines. The engine can be doing
[1:29:41] everything it's supposed to be doing.
[1:29:43] the piston's moving up and down, the the
[1:29:45] valves are actuating, the the crank is
[1:29:48] turning, but if but if everything is not
[1:29:50] doing it when it's supposed to do it in
[1:29:53] the perfect beat and rhythm, that's why
[1:29:55] they set the timing on on on an engine
[1:29:57] like that.
[1:29:59] So, so you you if you don't know and you
[1:30:03] say, why do you why do you want to bring
[1:30:04] that up? Because too often times you and
[1:30:07] I say you and I
[1:30:10] you and I get out of the beat. Yeah. And
[1:30:14] there were two or three of them little
[1:30:15] girls at the end of the line who got out
[1:30:17] of step. They were still marching. They
[1:30:19] were still in the procession. They're
[1:30:21] still going upward. But a prophet felt
[1:30:23] the need to scream to them. And I feel
[1:30:25] the need to say to us today, "Get in
[1:30:27] line. Stay in step."
[1:30:29] Because you say, "Well, what's the
[1:30:31] biggest evidence, Brother Jason? What's
[1:30:34] what's a a big evidence? What's a big
[1:30:36] tell that I'm not walking in the beat of
[1:30:40] the age I'm living in?" When your life
[1:30:42] mimics more the world than it does the
[1:30:44] word, you're out of beat
[1:30:48] because you're not understanding the
[1:30:50] beat of the age you're in. The beat of
[1:30:53] the world is increased with goods have
[1:30:56] need of nothing. Rich, increased with
[1:30:58] goods have need of nothing. And he's
[1:31:00] saying to them, not only are you not
[1:31:02] rich and increased with goods, you're
[1:31:03] actually blind. You're naked. You have
[1:31:07] you don't just need you need everything.
[1:31:10] Yeah, you don't have life. You don't
[1:31:12] need a bigger bank account. What you
[1:31:13] need is life. People, when you drive by
[1:31:17] a graveyard, the bodies laying in that
[1:31:18] graveyard don't need your help, they
[1:31:20] need life.
[1:31:23] See, so so you you understand that not
[1:31:28] only not only do you understand better
[1:31:31] the beat of the age you're in, that it's
[1:31:33] darkness and gross darkness on the
[1:31:35] people, you understand that this is the
[1:31:37] age that put Christ out. So you're not
[1:31:38] trying to mimic the church. They're dead
[1:31:40] with a
[1:31:41] gravestone. We're not trying to be them.
[1:31:43] We're not trying to look like them, act
[1:31:45] like them, worship like them, nothing
[1:31:47] like them. That's a dead system that
[1:31:50] we're trying to get people to come out
[1:31:52] of and join us, not us joining in with
[1:31:55] them.
[1:31:58] So, not only does it does it show you
[1:32:01] the age that you're living in, but it
[1:32:04] also informs your thinking as to the
[1:32:08] purpose, the reason God put you here in
[1:32:13] the worst of all ages.
[1:32:18] Amen. Because if you don't get that, you
[1:32:20] spend a lot of time saying, "Gee, Lord,
[1:32:22] thanks."
[1:32:24] Wow. Really?
[1:32:27] But he put you here on purpose
[1:32:31] because he has confidence that you say,
[1:32:34] "But it's just too tough." Oh, you
[1:32:37] you're right. It's not just too tough.
[1:32:38] It's impossible.
[1:32:40] That's why you've been given sheet
[1:32:42] music. That's why you're encouraged to
[1:32:45] let your life song sing.
[1:32:48] See, that's what we learned from Brother
[1:32:50] Brandham in his message, Shalom. It was
[1:32:53] a preview of the bride. Brother Jason,
[1:32:56] why do you emphasize it was a preview?
[1:32:57] Because it laid out her life in the
[1:32:59] future before the rapture. Yeah, it she
[1:33:03] was getting out of step and he was
[1:33:04] screaming, "Get right at the end of the
[1:33:06] line." At the not the beginning of
[1:33:08] Leodysa, they lived righteous sanct you
[1:33:10] had Billy Sunday and FF Bosworth and and
[1:33:13] and all of those great Wigglesworth guys
[1:33:15] and and and and they were wonderful men
[1:33:18] and and who lived. But it's at the end
[1:33:20] of the age when the when the you know
[1:33:23] everything becomes a mixture and and
[1:33:25] it's all people's rights and and
[1:33:27] everything starts an amalgamation and
[1:33:29] we're not we're come out of her be a
[1:33:32] separate saith the Lord. And so this
[1:33:36] would be the age where he would where he
[1:33:38] would have to uh uh he's going to
[1:33:41] fortell her future before the rapture.
[1:33:44] But nobody caught it at the time.
[1:33:49] because they thought they were leaving
[1:33:51] imminently. Right when brother Brandham
[1:33:54] is preaching the
[1:33:55] rapture, parents never thought their
[1:33:57] kids would go to school.
[1:34:00] Amen.
[1:34:02] So, you know, it a lot of times the
[1:34:05] question arises and it's it's not a it's
[1:34:08] not a a fair question. It's not a
[1:34:10] question we should spend a lot of time
[1:34:11] dwelling on, you know. So, so, Brother
[1:34:14] Jason, here we are, you know, almost
[1:34:16] almost 70
[1:34:18] years. Uh, you know, after the opening
[1:34:21] of the seals, it I mean, it won't be
[1:34:23] very long. It'll be 70 years. And I
[1:34:25] don't want to get into dates and times
[1:34:27] and numbers. I got have to deal with
[1:34:28] that enough when I get into my prophecy
[1:34:31] series. But, but, you know, I I just say
[1:34:33] it like this that it's it's it's
[1:34:36] sometimes comes on people's minds. Has
[1:34:39] has the have these decades been brother
[1:34:43] Jason is it have we been living out
[1:34:46] those things that brother Brandham said
[1:34:48] there was a secret to it. He said that I
[1:34:50] was told not to tell it and he said I'll
[1:34:52] take that secret to my grave. Yeah.
[1:34:56] Remember a part of it came through. He
[1:34:57] said I got a fold of it. Then another
[1:34:59] part come through and it flew across
[1:35:00] there in an unknown tongue and I
[1:35:02] couldn't make it out. Amen. and he said
[1:35:04] it's just not exactly time for it
[1:35:08] yet. So, are we living out some of those
[1:35:11] secret things? Has that is that what has
[1:35:13] been happening? Uh and and I personally
[1:35:16] believe that that that's a fair
[1:35:19] answer. You know, are we living out
[1:35:21] those secret things that brother
[1:35:22] Brandham said he would take to the
[1:35:24] grave? Well, now I don't know. That's
[1:35:25] not for me to say. That's not for you to
[1:35:27] say. That none can say that. But I can
[1:35:29] say this that all history has been under
[1:35:33] the perfect control of prophecy. Now I
[1:35:35] can say that as a student of history and
[1:35:39] prophecy. I can tell you that all
[1:35:41] history has been under the control of
[1:35:43] prophecy. And I mean that in the most
[1:35:46] absolute sense. And all I can say is
[1:35:49] that the word of God uh has been
[1:35:52] unfolding in God's perfect time. And
[1:35:55] it's being and it has been being lived
[1:35:57] out by his family. That's what I can
[1:36:00] say.
[1:36:01] That's how we got here. That go that the
[1:36:04] family that God ordained before the
[1:36:07] foundation of the world. That's what's
[1:36:09] up. That's what's been happening. Amen.
[1:36:16] I believe this is partly why brother
[1:36:18] Brandham could say to the bride that she
[1:36:22] should not try to make herself into
[1:36:24] anything. I think that's that's a large
[1:36:27] reason of why he said that because there
[1:36:30] were things that were coming unfolding.
[1:36:33] And when we're talking about unfolding,
[1:36:35] it we're not talking about a prophet in
[1:36:38] a return ministry coming back preaching
[1:36:40] and telling us what what the unfolding
[1:36:42] was doctrally like he did in the seals
[1:36:44] and different things like that. I
[1:36:46] believe that we're understanding it
[1:36:47] better as we've been becoming it. See,
[1:36:51] and so I and so I think that this is uh
[1:36:53] this is why he could he could say to the
[1:36:55] bride that she should not try to make
[1:36:57] herself into anything. You know, we're
[1:36:59] we're to find the perfect will of God.
[1:37:03] Um, I I've I've thought I've tried, how
[1:37:06] can I say it better and I can't seem to
[1:37:07] improve on this statement. The bride has
[1:37:10] gotten to where she has gotten to by
[1:37:13] surrendering her way forward. So, you're
[1:37:16] not trying to make yourself something.
[1:37:18] But neither are you driving around in a
[1:37:20] traffic circle. You don't you're not
[1:37:22] gold bricking. You don't got your foot
[1:37:23] up on the table and saying somewhere
[1:37:26] over rainbow he'll make me perfect and
[1:37:28] I'll go in rapture.
[1:37:31] We've been here on a mission.
[1:37:35] Yes. You You understand? And so, so, so
[1:37:38] e even even after the blood was applied
[1:37:40] to the door in the first Exodus, they
[1:37:42] didn't leave that night. It was the next
[1:37:45] day. They had to go all the way through
[1:37:47] and in. And then there had to be a
[1:37:49] spoiling of Egypt and gave them all this
[1:37:51] and assemble everybody. We've been
[1:37:53] assembling. That's what's happening.
[1:37:55] We've been marshalling around the world
[1:37:56] getting ready for a march to the
[1:37:58] heavens. Amen. Even when they were going
[1:38:00] to cross the Jordan, they lingered 30
[1:38:02] days after the death of Moses. And you
[1:38:04] know what they did? I read a commentator
[1:38:06] said for 30 days they sat around and
[1:38:10] retold the stories of Moses and lamented
[1:38:13] his passing and told about this miracle
[1:38:15] and this campaign and this meeting. And
[1:38:17] haven't we done that, friends? And it's
[1:38:18] good. And they did it and it was great
[1:38:20] and we've done it and it's been fine. We
[1:38:21] still do it to this day. I might do it
[1:38:23] tomorrow to somebody who don't know. But
[1:38:25] I'm crossing Jordan.
[1:38:28] I'm not just here to remember what was.
[1:38:30] I'm looking for what's coming.
[1:38:35] See, so,
[1:38:36] so, so we've surrendered our way
[1:38:39] forward. And this is a great truth that
[1:38:41] I fear has too often been abandoned over
[1:38:44] these decades after the prophet met went
[1:38:47] home as as men, you know, for I don't
[1:38:51] want to question their motives. I'm just
[1:38:53] looking at the fruit of things. But
[1:38:55] sometimes men, you know, over these
[1:38:57] decades, they've risen up and built
[1:39:00] ministry kingdoms to themselves. And I I
[1:39:04] don't I don't really blame the people as
[1:39:06] much as I blame these ministers. Uh but
[1:39:09] because especially we you know what's
[1:39:11] the old saying? But for the grace of
[1:39:13] God, there go I. So we're not here to
[1:39:16] condemn. I appreciate everybody for
[1:39:18] their run. Maybe they maybe maybe those
[1:39:21] men I would pale in comparison to my
[1:39:23] life as of sanctification compared to
[1:39:25] them. I don't know. But I I just know
[1:39:27] that that a lot of times people were
[1:39:30] most often caught up in those things and
[1:39:32] they still get caught up in them to this
[1:39:34] day and it's due to a lack in their own
[1:39:37] experience and most times it's not even
[1:39:40] perceived. Right. Amen. And the only
[1:39:44] sign that they have is they chase
[1:39:47] personalities.
[1:39:48] They chase ministry personalities. And
[1:39:52] they they think they're spiritual.
[1:39:53] They're very religious, but that doesn't
[1:39:55] mean they're very spiritual. And you
[1:39:58] realize and and a lot of times it's for
[1:40:00] that reason because they lack a a real
[1:40:02] depth of experience. And when you l when
[1:40:05] you lack your own deep personal
[1:40:06] experience of knowing God, you go for
[1:40:09] that. Yeah. You go for that naturally.
[1:40:12] You know why? Because it's easier. It
[1:40:14] It's easier. You just find you a
[1:40:16] Superman ministry that will do all the
[1:40:18] harder work uh of of of spiritual the
[1:40:21] harder spiritual work of the heart.
[1:40:24] Changing the outside, dressing right is
[1:40:26] is the simple part. People choose
[1:40:29] legalism because it's easy. All they
[1:40:31] have to do is dress a certain way, have
[1:40:33] the right kind of vernacular, and go to
[1:40:34] the right church and sing the right
[1:40:35] songs. And everybody say, "He's a real
[1:40:37] Christian." She's a real Christian. But
[1:40:39] the but Elijah wasn't sent to do that.
[1:40:41] Elijah was sent to turn the heart.
[1:40:43] Hallelujah. Amen. And that requires
[1:40:45] introspection. And people don't like
[1:40:47] that if if what's inside is dark. And
[1:40:50] I'm not talking about past pains. I'm
[1:40:52] talking about inner desires that you
[1:40:54] know are not according to the word of
[1:40:55] God. But I'm here to tell you today,
[1:40:57] they're they're they're worse than the
[1:40:59] IRS. They're not going to go away. You
[1:41:01] can't just ignore them. They're coming
[1:41:03] for you. And you the best thing you can
[1:41:05] do is come into the house of God and
[1:41:07] say, "Lord God, take everything out of
[1:41:09] me that's not like you." and put your
[1:41:11] life and your word inside of me.
[1:41:15] See, so you know, people do that. They
[1:41:19] find those kind of ministries because,
[1:41:21] you know, let somebody else do all the
[1:41:23] harder work for me and live it and be
[1:41:25] the right kind of attitude. But that's
[1:41:27] not the way of the word. Amen. And so
[1:41:30] this is why when brother Brandham is
[1:41:32] asked the question in COD 63 and he says
[1:41:35] now just because he's he left so much
[1:41:39] you know of the seals and and and so now
[1:41:42] he's got these questions and answers on
[1:41:44] the seals you know and and so he he
[1:41:47] hasn't even yet come to the seventh seal
[1:41:50] and they're already asking him questions
[1:41:53] you know what do we do what do we do how
[1:41:54] do brother Brandham this what a
[1:41:55] challenge what do we do how do we get to
[1:41:57] where you are and brother Brandham says,
[1:41:59] "Now just don't interpret
[1:42:03] nothing." Now, he interprets his word by
[1:42:05] bringing it to pass. So, you're not
[1:42:07] trying to be something.
[1:42:10] You're not trying to just look like an
[1:42:12] overcomer. You're actually trying to let
[1:42:14] your life testify that you are an
[1:42:16] overcomer.
[1:42:20] Now, just don't don't interpret nothing.
[1:42:23] If you want if you want to know
[1:42:26] anything, he'll send it to you. See? So,
[1:42:30] just be real, real solid now. Don't try
[1:42:35] to make yourself odd to be a Christian
[1:42:40] because you take yourself away from God.
[1:42:43] All right. Amen. Say, "Where did I take
[1:42:46] I'm getting more godly. Where did I take
[1:42:48] it? Where did I take me to?" To the man
[1:42:50] in the mirror.
[1:42:52] You took yourself away from God. You
[1:42:55] took him to you.
[1:42:57] Why? But if you wanted to be you, why
[1:42:59] bother trying to beat him? Right?
[1:43:01] See, and so a a prophet knew that we
[1:43:05] couldn't make ourselves He knew we
[1:43:08] couldn't make ourselves into the elected
[1:43:10] people. Wow. I am I've got to close. He
[1:43:12] knew that he couldn't that we couldn't
[1:43:14] make ourselves into the elected people
[1:43:17] who would, as he said, take this message
[1:43:20] and carry it on to the coming of the
[1:43:22] Lord. He knew we couldn't make ourselves
[1:43:25] into that. See, God would actually have
[1:43:28] to do that again. So again, so again,
[1:43:32] here we come. We're right back where we
[1:43:34] started. So So again, God's got to do
[1:43:37] it. So we do So how do we do it? We
[1:43:40] surrender our way forward. Amen. See,
[1:43:45] he's the only one. God's the only one
[1:43:47] who knew uh that the
[1:43:50] world would choose Satan as the god of
[1:43:54] this evil age. Yeah. Amen. The Lord knew
[1:43:56] that. He's the only one who knew it till
[1:43:59] a prophet. It was revealed to a prophet.
[1:44:01] No one imagined that would be the end of
[1:44:03] the Christian church that they would put
[1:44:05] Christ out of his own church he'd been
[1:44:06] in for 2,000 years.
[1:44:10] He knew I God knew that the fallen
[1:44:13] church that that walked off the edge and
[1:44:16] plunged into the abyss, you know, can I
[1:44:20] can I say it to you in a from a certain
[1:44:22] angle? You know, it wasn't that they
[1:44:26] decided it wasn't that they decided to
[1:44:29] stop being his mouthpiece. They did stop
[1:44:34] something, but they didn't try to stop
[1:44:37] being his mouthpiece. What they stopped
[1:44:40] was coming to his supper. Amen. And so
[1:44:45] God, they didn't they didn't decide to
[1:44:47] stop being his mouthpiece. God took that
[1:44:50] privilege away from them when they made
[1:44:53] excuses for not coming to his supper
[1:44:57] that Jesus told about a great man had a
[1:45:01] supper and sent out his servants go and
[1:45:02] bid them to come. Many are called see
[1:45:06] and so they willfully many of them some
[1:45:09] of them they they they willfully chose
[1:45:12] organized religion over the power and
[1:45:14] demonstration of the living God. Uh you
[1:45:17] know I I hey uh I got my own program for
[1:45:20] life. I I pray they have me excused. Oh
[1:45:24] my. Amen. Granted.
[1:45:30] I've got friends and I got a career to
[1:45:33] think about. I pray they have me
[1:45:35] excused. Grant.
[1:45:41] Granted. We can make a great
[1:45:43] denominational name for ourselves.
[1:45:45] Please have me
[1:45:47] excused.
[1:45:50] Granted, for I say unto you that none of
[1:45:53] those men which were bidden shall taste
[1:45:56] of my supper.
[1:46:02] Shalom was preached in 1964. I'm I'm
[1:46:05] very near uh the end. I'm actually not.
[1:46:09] So, I'll just stop here in a
[1:46:11] moment. So much for So much for that.
[1:46:16] Part
[1:46:22] five. You know, society at large. No,
[1:46:26] I'm not. I'm done. Stand
[1:46:29] up. Not going to do it. All right. That
[1:46:32] would have Because as soon as I said
[1:46:33] that, I realized, oh, then you're going
[1:46:35] to have to then then then. Okay. Praise
[1:46:37] the Lord. Come. Amen. Brother Kenny.
[1:46:40] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[1:46:42] Amen.
[1:46:45] Preaching is
[1:46:47] weird. The Bible calls it
[1:46:50] foolishness. So, I apologize for
[1:46:52] foolishness today. Um, give me something
[1:46:56] soft and uh worshipful. Brother Kenny, I
[1:46:58] want you to bow your heads with
[1:47:01] me all over the building and just
[1:47:03] quietly, Deb, please.
[1:47:14] Yeah.
[1:47:15] Okay. Praise the
[1:47:19] Lord, Father. I'm just sure that was
[1:47:21] you. And now that gives me peace. I
[1:47:25] won't go away today
[1:47:29] worrying. I remember brother
[1:47:34] Brandham. Maybe not exactly like I did
[1:47:36] it, but very close. And he's just
[1:47:38] preaching
[1:47:39] away and he's actually in discernment.
[1:47:42] and he's discerning people and telling
[1:47:44] the secrets of men's hearts. And
[1:47:46] suddenly he just stops and calls a
[1:47:47] prayer calls up
[1:47:50] uh sinners to to the
[1:47:52] altar. And he says, "I didn't ever done
[1:47:54] that, but he told me, make an altar call
[1:47:56] right
[1:47:57] now." Apparently, the word had found its
[1:48:00] mark and the the arrow of deliverance
[1:48:03] that was shot from his throne has found
[1:48:05] its mark, and hearts are ready to be
[1:48:08] dealt with.
[1:48:10] I don't want to be my own kingdom
[1:48:13] building ministry trying to go and say
[1:48:15] what I want to say. Lord, I promised you
[1:48:17] this morning early that I just wanted
[1:48:20] your complete direction and now you call
[1:48:23] me to stand the people up with heads and
[1:48:27] hearts are bowed and we're asking the
[1:48:31] question, are you friend here today or
[1:48:35] across the airwaves or by an archive?
[1:48:38] Would you say, "Brother Jason, I am I I
[1:48:41] believe him. I'm part of the family of
[1:48:43] God. I've had an experience with the
[1:48:45] Lord, but truth be truth. I haven't done
[1:48:48] a lot of upward trending because I
[1:48:51] haven't done a lot of onward
[1:48:53] walking. I'm not really going forward. I
[1:48:56] seem to be going around and around. And
[1:48:58] I I don't want to
[1:49:01] be the one who said, "Please have me
[1:49:05] excused."
[1:49:06] I don't want to think about my career
[1:49:09] and my friends and my or some
[1:49:11] denominational organized system or some
[1:49:14] popularity, some fortune and glory, some
[1:49:17] wealth or fame and say, "Oh, please have
[1:49:20] me excused. No, Lord, not me, not these
[1:49:22] people. Don't let it be." So
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:28] maybe your desire today is to say,
[1:49:31] "Lord, I I have to confess in your
[1:49:34] presence cuz it wouldn't do me any good
[1:49:35] to lie to you. You see my heart anyway.
[1:49:38] I might as well just now that I'm
[1:49:40] exposed by the Holy Spirit, I might as
[1:49:42] well just raise up my hands and say,
[1:49:44] "Have mercy on me, oh God." I raise up
[1:49:47] both of mine, Lord, with all the
[1:49:49] sincerity I can muster. I'm not trying
[1:49:51] to be an example. People's heads are
[1:49:53] bowed, but I got both my hands up
[1:49:55] because I want more of you. I don't want
[1:49:57] to just drive around in circles. I want
[1:49:58] to go
[1:50:00] forward. I want to go onward, Christian
[1:50:03] soldier. I want to be in the rhythm. I
[1:50:06] want my life song to sing. I want to
[1:50:07] know the beat of the age I'm in. And I
[1:50:09] want to I want to be in the right beat,
[1:50:12] the right melody. I want my life to be a
[1:50:15] living melody, a
[1:50:19] display. Grant it, Lord God. I pray
[1:50:21] you'll grant it to us today. I I would
[1:50:25] imagine that hands went up everywhere,
[1:50:27] Lord. I won't even know, but hands
[1:50:29] perhaps went up everywhere, Lord God.
[1:50:31] And that's our desire today. Oh, let it
[1:50:35] be to us, Master. I pray thee. Let it be
[1:50:38] to us today. Give us hearing hearts that
[1:50:41] we might hear you more clearly. I know
[1:50:44] the word has found its mark today. I
[1:50:46] know it has. You found us out. Yep. You
[1:50:49] found our address. Mhm. You did. You
[1:50:52] did. It's beautiful. You're so
[1:50:54] wonderful, Lord. We love you for
[1:50:57] it. I pray for your great mercy on us as
[1:51:00] a congregation. Your great mercy upon us
[1:51:03] in days to come that we might apply the
[1:51:07] things we've
[1:51:08] heard. Yay. And amen. I commit it to you
[1:51:12] now in Jesus name. Amen. Let's sing,
[1:51:16] Brother Kenny.
[1:51:19] Oh. Oh, thank you for that.
[1:51:22] But now I'm
[1:51:26] You want to worship him just a little
[1:51:27] bit?
[1:51:30] Lift it up. But now I'm found.
[1:51:36] So far
[1:51:40] away all together. But I'm home now.
[1:51:44] Hallelujah. I once was
[1:51:48] lost. But now, but now I'm But now I'm
[1:51:53] found.
[1:51:55] And now, now my life. Now that I've been
[1:52:00] found.
[1:52:01] Now that I've been found, let my life.
[1:52:04] Once was, oh God.
[1:52:08] But now I
[1:52:12] see. I once was blind.
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:17] But now I
[1:52:21] see. I don't know how. I don't know how.
[1:52:26] But when he touched me, I don't know
[1:52:30] how. But when he touched me, Ice was

[1:56:11] [Music]
[1:56:18] Let my
[1:56:21] [Music]
[1:56:23] life
[1:56:27] sing to you.
[1:56:32] Just softly. Just softly. Brother Kenny,
[1:56:34] you can keep singing. Just
[1:56:36] softly. Lord
[1:56:39] Jesus, what a day this has
[1:56:42] been. What a time in your presence we've
[1:56:45] had.
[1:56:46] Much has been said, weighty matters.
[1:56:50] Sometimes, Lord, dark sayings and
[1:56:53] weighty matters.
[1:56:55] But the spirit of God anointed it. I
[1:56:58] could feel the Holy Spirit
[1:57:01] flowing. I stood here today, Lord, as
[1:57:03] your unworthy servant speaking to
[1:57:05] unworthy people. There's no good that we
[1:57:08] can bring you, Lord. All we can do is
[1:57:11] cling to Calvar's cross.
[1:57:14] All we can do
[1:57:18] You say, "God, have mercy on me." That's
[1:57:22] all the publican could
[1:57:24] do. Oh, that priest with all of his
[1:57:27] bragging. And that poor publican just
[1:57:29] stood there. He smoked his breast and
[1:57:31] said, "God, be merciful to me a sinner.
[1:57:34] Help us today, Lord. We We've all sinned
[1:57:38] and come short of thy word and thy
[1:57:40] promises, but today we want to believe
[1:57:43] them with fresh faith." And a fresh
[1:57:45] determination. We don't want to I don't
[1:57:48] want this to be death and revival. I
[1:57:50] want this to be the seedline of Christ
[1:57:51] that lives forever.
[1:57:54] Amen. As Melzdc, a priest that abideth
[1:57:58] forever. Your life is a continual life.
[1:58:02] It continually grows. It moves forward.
[1:58:07] Lord, one
[1:58:12] [Music]
[1:58:15] day, a great
[1:58:18] man came to his
[1:58:21] servant and he said, "Why should
[1:58:24] I allow this tree any further? It it
[1:58:28] every year I come looking for fruit and
[1:58:32] it every year at harvest it's barren and
[1:58:36] why would I let it encumber the ground
[1:58:38] and drink up the nutrients and the
[1:58:40] vitamins that the other trees
[1:58:43] need. Take it out, pull it down, do away
[1:58:46] with
[1:58:47] it. And the servant said, "Please, Lord,
[1:58:52] just give me more
[1:58:53] [Music]
[1:58:54] time. I know your coming is
[1:58:59] soon. I know, Lord, that those who
[1:59:03] reject you do so to their own peril, but
[1:59:07] going to have more
[1:59:09] time. And he said, "Lord, if you'll just
[1:59:11] give me time, I'll I'll dig around the
[1:59:13] roots some more. The tree is not going
[1:59:15] to like it, but I'll do it to try to
[1:59:17] save its life. And I'll I'll fertilize
[1:59:20] it and I'll dig and I'll shake it up and
[1:59:22] I'll make it
[1:59:23] uncomfortable. But I I want to have
[1:59:25] another chance. Oh, once more,
[1:59:28] Lord. Grant us another chance. And the
[1:59:30] prophet when he takes Samson
[1:59:34] and he said, "Maybe there's a chance
[1:59:38] just like Samson." Yeah. And Samson
[1:59:41] said, "Once more, Lord." And the prophet
[1:59:42] said, "Maybe you're here today and you'd
[1:59:46] say once more, oh God, once more. Stir
[1:59:50] my heart, Lord. Once more, reach down
[1:59:53] into my life and do that which I cannot
[1:59:55] do. I couldn't find me. You found me.
[1:59:57] Now help me. I couldn't save myself. You
[2:00:00] saved me. But now I need to ascend. I
[2:00:03] need to go forward."
[2:00:05] Forward is onward. And onward is upward.
[2:00:09] Grant it to us, Lord.
[2:00:12] I pray for the flock thou hast given me
[2:00:16] care over.
[2:00:18] Help us, master. Help me, your humble
[2:00:21] servant, to cause people to love you,
[2:00:25] love your word. And if I can if I can
[2:00:28] attract their attention to your word,
[2:00:30] the to the lovely Lord Jesus, I can I
[2:00:32] can get them away from gazing at those
[2:00:34] shiny things.
[2:00:38] That's why that's why parents don't just
[2:00:42] let children do what they want.
[2:00:46] They're they're given charge to guide
[2:00:49] and direct in the way the child ought to
[2:00:51] go. You can't. That's the that's the
[2:00:53] modern age. That's the lie. Just let
[2:00:55] them grow and be what they want to be.
[2:00:57] But but but a child, they'll they'll
[2:01:00] grab at the first shiny thing they see
[2:01:02] you and it might hurt them. And so
[2:01:06] you're you're a parent. You're a father.
[2:01:08] You you pull us away from those shiny
[2:01:11] things. Prophet said, "Don't chase shiny
[2:01:13] things. Go after the gospel. It glows."
[2:01:15] Gospel is not shiny and glittery. In
[2:01:18] fact is it has very little beauty and
[2:01:20] the world doesn't desire it, but it
[2:01:22] glows with the love of God and the power
[2:01:24] of the
[2:01:27] spirit. So we can never compromise from
[2:01:31] this pull pit. Parents can never
[2:01:32] compromise from their pull pits.
[2:01:35] and pull pits they have. Oh
[2:01:38] yeah. So I pray for your mercy on us
[2:01:41] today as we go from this building. Help
[2:01:44] us, Lord. Help us to be going
[2:01:47] forward. If I can go forward, then I'm
[2:01:51] going onward. And if I can go onward,
[2:01:53] then I'm going upward whether I feel
[2:01:55] like I am or not. Here's what I know.
[2:01:58] The further the world goes downward, I
[2:02:00] must be going upward.
[2:02:02] So I I commit it to you now and I leave
[2:02:05] it into your care. Enough has been said
[2:02:07] by men. Now Lord, let the Holy Spirit
[2:02:11] speak to hearts. We commit it to you in
[2:02:13] Jesus name. Amen. Sing for us my brother
[2:02:16] friends. God bless you at your leisure.
[2:02:18] You can be dismissed. God bless you.
[2:02:20] Sing brother Kim.
