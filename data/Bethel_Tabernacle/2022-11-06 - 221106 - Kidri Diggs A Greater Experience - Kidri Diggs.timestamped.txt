[4:08] We don't have any written requests here.
[4:13] Amen.
[4:18] Amen.
[4:23] God bless you all. Amen. Aba,
[4:27] my daughter's mother-in-law
[4:30] because she didn't have insurance, she
[4:32] kind of stayed away from getting treated
[4:34] and diagnosed. So, she had breast cancer
[4:36] and they kind of think it went into a
[4:37] lymph system.
[4:39] I don't I think Friday she was supposed
[4:41] to have an MRI. I haven't heard anything
[4:43] back about that, but I really want to
[4:45] continue praying for her. And I believe
[4:47] somebody out there can touch God. I'll
[4:50] try to. I believe I will also. I believe
[4:54] he's he answers prayer.
[4:56] If you have a request upon your heart
[4:58] this morning, I know we have some that
[5:00] are not feeling well and feeling sick. I
[5:02] mean, they exhausted themselves at this
[5:05] youth camp and they're recovering. Amen.
[5:09] Oh, God will bless you for that. Let's
[5:12] pray.
[5:14] Oh, Father, I love you this morning,
[5:16] Lord.
[5:18] What a precious promise, Lord,
[5:21] going in the rapture.
[5:24] Lord, it's it's coming to that time,
[5:27] Father. You brought your word to its
[5:28] fullness, and now you're bringing your
[5:30] bride to the fullness, Father. We see
[5:33] all things manifesting and maturing,
[5:36] Father.
[5:37] And Lord, we believe by faith we are
[5:40] maturing and manifesting also.
[5:43] Your word will not return void.
[5:46] Lord, I pray for Angie Hat this morning.
[5:50] Lord, I come against that cancer
[5:52] regardless of how far it's gone.
[5:56] In the name of Jesus Christ, as brother
[5:59] Brandham,
[6:00] I speak to the spirit of that cancer
[6:05] and you killed it. And I pray the same
[6:07] prayer by faith this morning for Sister
[6:10] Angie Hath. Father, kill the cancer. You
[6:14] have been rebuked in the name of Jesus
[6:16] Christ.
[6:18] Lord, reach down for every request,
[6:20] every need of the heart this morning.
[6:23] Thank you for the song service, Father.
[6:25] The precious songs that just speak from
[6:28] the heart, Father.
[6:30] And Lord, as we go forward, we pray that
[6:32] you would bless the tithes and
[6:34] offerings, bless the cheerful giver. And
[6:37] Lord, we're all moving towards the
[6:40] greatest form of worship this morning,
[6:42] the ministering of your word. I pray for
[6:45] the minister. You'd have total freedom,
[6:48] Lord, that you could just you want to
[6:50] raise each and every one of us up
[6:52] higher. May we surrender our hearts to
[6:54] listen,
[6:56] to receive what you have for us, Father.
[6:59] bless those that are away ministering.
[7:01] Remember our brother Jason
[7:04] over in foreign lands, Father.
[7:07] Lord, I I would be loaded just to go
[7:10] across the border into Mexico and
[7:11] Canada, never mind over in the Middle
[7:14] East. I pray that you watch over him.
[7:17] Keep him safe. Father, remember our
[7:20] pastor this evening, this morning,

[7:24] brother John Andy's.
[7:27] Bless the congregation. and bless the
[7:28] ministry. Remember our brother Brad

[7:37] team. Pray that you bless each and every
[7:40] one of us, Father, in Jesus Christ's
[7:42] name. Amen.

[27:15] Excited to be in the house of the Lord.
[27:18] And I feel like we just uh speak for
[27:20] myself here, but I know I'm speaking for
[27:22] many. Feels like we're just uh getting
[27:24] back from battle and fought the devil.
[27:27] And now we're all here all together. And
[27:29] I know the devil's been fighting. Uh my
[27:32] goodness, has he been fighting us uh on
[27:34] every front and on every level after
[27:36] camp? You have the post camp blues and
[27:40] uh and then you you just got the devil
[27:41] fighting you almost every single day
[27:43] that getting a report of something else
[27:46] that the devil's just attacking our
[27:47] little assembly here. So, we're going to
[27:49] bind together. Got some prayer requests
[27:51] here we want to read. We're going to
[27:52] bind together in faith. I believe the
[27:55] name of the Lord is a strong tower the
[27:57] righteous can run into. you could take
[27:59] all of your needs and be safe. Amen.
[28:02] Thankful for that. I'm here. It wasn't
[28:04] supposed to be. Um, but just got really
[28:08] sick in my body all throughout the week.
[28:10] Even yesterday, probably felt the worst.
[28:12] I felt just the devil just afflicting
[28:15] me. And I was going to be ministering in
[28:17] Indiana actually for brother Andrew's
[28:19] brother, brother brother Brian Cobb. And
[28:21] so we rescheduled that for later and the
[28:23] Lord just seen fit that I would be here.
[28:25] So, y'all just pray for me and all those
[28:27] that are struggling with it. Still just
[28:29] trying to recover and and uh I'm
[28:32] thankfully uh uh doing better today, but
[28:35] just weary in my body. And I know
[28:38] there's many others. The devil tried to
[28:40] fight Sister Sarah Y. And then I guess
[28:43] he didn't feel like that was enough. So,
[28:44] he attacked brother Brad who's away
[28:46] ministering with a kidney infection and
[28:48] he's preaching the gospel this morning.
[28:50] So, we just want to remember our brother
[28:52] Brad and brother uh Jason Demar is also
[28:55] going overseas to Turkey and battling
[28:57] the same sickness, but it was already on
[28:59] the flight already all the way over
[29:00] there and we've been texting back and
[29:02] forth with him. Many other needs I'm
[29:05] sure that I won't even uh get to uh when
[29:08] we pray here, but Sister Hazel Grace,
[29:10] that's why brother John, sister
[29:11] Meredith, I are not here this morning.
[29:13] And also, Brother Landon Cobb have both
[29:15] been real sick and need prayer this
[29:17] morning. Um, also I'm going to read a
[29:20] testimony from Sister Brenda. Uh, she
[29:23] says, "Had another six-month CT scan
[29:26] followup. The scan continues to show the
[29:29] beautiful deliverance and healing from
[29:31] cancer. It is testifying of the battle
[29:33] that took place and who was the
[29:35] victorious winner. It testifies that not
[29:38] only did the enemy have to leave, it has
[29:41] no evidence of ever having been there.
[29:45] I rejoice with the do when the doctor
[29:47] says your scan is beautiful and there's
[29:49] no evidence of ever having the disease.
[29:53] That is my God, his grace and healing to
[29:55] me. All the glory to God. Hallelujah.
[30:01] Praise the Lord.
[30:03] Praise the Lord, Sister Brenda. Amen. We
[30:05] rejoice with you this morning. Amen.
[30:07] From brother Joe how shall also prayer
[30:09] request for his entire family with the
[30:11] cold and flu like symptoms. Uh, and and
[30:15] I think that was his entire family. Yep.
[30:17] I got that this morning also from a few
[30:19] people um for uh Joe and Abby and Seth
[30:23] and all of them just battling this
[30:24] morning. So, we want to remember them in
[30:26] prayer. I think that was all the prayer
[30:28] requests that we had that came written
[30:30] in. Maybe you have something upon your
[30:32] heart, something you're expecting the
[30:34] Lord to speak and say, "Lord, use
[30:35] Brother Diggs." How many would say that?
[30:38] Raise a hand and show the Lord. Say,
[30:39] Lord, may you use your servant to come
[30:41] down to my avenue, my address. Amen. And
[30:44] speak to me this morning. Let's just bow
[30:46] our heads. Lord Jesus. Lord, we testify
[30:49] and give you thanks, Lord, for your
[30:51] mercy is good and it endures forever,
[30:54] Lord. Thank you for your healing, Lord,
[30:56] and the miraculous victory for our
[30:58] sister Brenda. We rejoice and we give
[31:00] you thanks for that, Lord. We recognize
[31:02] your hand Lord moving amongst us now God
[31:06] on the behalf of these needs Lord that
[31:07] have came in those that are sick and
[31:09] body Satan is waring and raging but you
[31:12] said when the enemy comes in like a
[31:14] flood that the spirit of the Lord would
[31:17] raise up a standard against him. So
[31:19] Lord, we as a body, as a bride body, we
[31:22] lift our hands and we say Lord, we raise
[31:24] up a standard and that's the name of the
[31:27] Lord Jesus Christ to come against any
[31:29] spirit that would try to afflict your
[31:31] family, your ministry that's out
[31:33] ministering this morning. My dad away in
[31:36] Washington. Lord, I pray God that you
[31:38] would send an angel, Lord. And may that
[31:40] angel minister to these brothers, Lord,
[31:42] for brother Joe and his family, Lord. I
[31:44] pray that your angel would come right
[31:46] now. Jesus, would you bring healing in
[31:49] your wings, Lord, to your children now?
[31:51] God, I pray for this entirety of this
[31:53] service, Lord, here this morning. You've
[31:55] seen it, Lord, before we ever gathered.
[31:57] You knew every need. You knew every
[31:59] situation, Lord. And we bring those
[32:01] needs and, Lord, of those requests to
[32:03] your altar, Lord. And we leave them
[32:05] there right now, expecting, Lord, that
[32:07] you have an answer for us. Bless the
[32:10] service now. Brother Diggs, Lord, as we
[32:12] move into the ministering of your word,
[32:13] we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[32:16] Christ. Only
[32:20] believe.
[32:22] [Music]
[32:24] Only
[32:27] believe. Could you raise your hands now?
[32:31] All things are possible.
[32:35] [Music]
[32:37] Oh,
[32:39] [Applause]
[32:41] [Music]
[32:48] holy.
[32:49] [Music]
[32:56] All things
[32:59] are simple.
[33:02] Ally
[33:04] believe. Lord, I believe. Lord,
[33:10] I believe.
[33:14] Lord,
[33:16] I believe.
[33:20] All things
[33:23] are possible.
[33:26] Lord, I
[33:29] believe. Lord, I believe. Lord,
[33:35] I believe.
[33:39] Lord,
[33:41] I believe.
[33:45] All things are possible.
[33:51] Lord, I
[33:54] believe.
[33:56] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[33:59] Ain't it good to be in the house of the
[34:00] Lord again?
[34:01] Amen. And as brother Matt said, uh the
[34:04] enemy has been fighting.
[34:06] Uh but that's a good thing.
[34:10] It's a good thing.
[34:12] If he fighting you, that mean he knows
[34:14] you don't belong to him.
[34:16] Hallelujah. He don't fight his own
[34:18] children
[34:19] because you know the Bible say if Satan
[34:21] cast out Satan, how could his kingdom
[34:22] stand?
[34:23] So if he's fighting you, that must mean
[34:25] he knows you don't belong to him.
[34:28] Amen. So praise God. I give you a little
[34:31] secret. You know, the enemy's been
[34:32] trying to fight me with a cough and you
[34:35] know, and you know, I've been feeling
[34:36] pretty good. You know, at the camp, you
[34:38] give me a little cough. So, I say, "All
[34:40] right, how do I turn this into a
[34:42] praise?"
[34:44] So, every time I cough, I say, "Thank
[34:46] you, Jesus."
[34:48] Now, how long y'all going to think he
[34:49] gonna mess with me if I keep if I keep
[34:52] saying, "Thank you, Jesus," with every
[34:53] cough. Come on. We got to beat him at
[34:56] his own tactics.
[34:58] You know, if we make you sleepy this
[34:59] morning, turn that yarn into a
[35:00] hallelujah.
[35:02] Hallelujah.
[35:04] [Applause]
[35:05] Amen. Take it back.
[35:07] Amen. We're children of God.
[35:09] And we ought to expect to have trials
[35:12] and tribulations because we're being
[35:13] made perfect.
[35:14] Amen. It's good to be here. We certainly
[35:17] thank God for all of you. It's It's good
[35:19] to be with my second family in Carolina.
[35:22] Amen.
[35:22] You know, and God has done some
[35:25] wonderful things. And I want to say to
[35:27] each and every one of you, I I certainly
[35:29] appreciate all that you do, whatever you
[35:32] did for the camp and and and you know,
[35:34] and just standing behind the ministry.
[35:36] Amen. Just appreciate people that
[35:38] support what God is doing. Amen. And uh
[35:41] we certainly appreciate brother Jason in
[35:42] his absence. We pray God would just be
[35:44] with him and all the ministering
[35:46] brothers and sisters and and children of
[35:49] God. Amen. God bless you. Let's just
[35:51] have a word of prayer and we'll get
[35:53] right into the word of God.
[35:56] Lord Jesus, Father, we're thankful
[35:57] today, Lord, to know that our footsteps
[36:00] are ordered by the Lord. Lord, for every
[36:03] situation, Lord, every test, every
[36:06] trial, Father, you've already seen it
[36:09] before the foundation of the world. Now,
[36:11] Lord, help us to look at things through
[36:13] the eyes of Christ, knowing that you've
[36:16] already made provisions for every step,
[36:19] for every way. Lord, you've already,
[36:21] Lord, laid your hand upon it, Lord. So,
[36:24] Father, help us to have within our
[36:27] spirits and our souls that all is well.
[36:30] And Lord, though we may not want to go
[36:32] through it, Father, but as you said, not
[36:34] my will, thy will be done.
[36:37] And Lord, we just want to be vessels of
[36:39] honor, Lord, to do your bidding, Lord,
[36:42] to to to to show that there is a living
[36:45] God upon the earth, Lord. We pray you
[36:46] bless this church, Lord. every family
[36:49] that's here, those that may be
[36:50] streaming, Lord. And Lord, just to know
[36:52] that we have the victory, Lord. And
[36:54] Father, forgive us for any thoughts
[36:55] that's not like your thoughts. Any ways
[36:57] is not like your ways. Father, keep your
[37:00] your wonderful, marvelous blood atoning
[37:02] to our lives and atoning for the sins
[37:05] that we have committed or may commit. In
[37:08] the wonderful name of Jesus Christ, we
[37:09] pray and we thank you, Lord. Let the
[37:11] church say, "Amen."
[37:12] Amen.
[37:13] Amen. Praise God. If you have your
[37:15] Bibles, let's turn to um Luke chapter
[37:19] 22.
[37:21] Luke 22.
[37:28] Luke 22.
[37:33] And I want to start reading at verse um
[37:36] let's start at verse
[37:40] verse 31.
[37:46] And the Lord said, "Simon, Simon,
[37:49] behold, Satan have desired to have you,
[37:53] that he may sift you as wheat, but I
[37:57] have prayed for thee,
[38:00] that thy faith fail not,
[38:03] and when thou art converted, strengthen
[38:07] thy brother."
[38:09] Amen. Let's go to Acts chapter one.
[38:13] Acts chapter 1,
[38:18] familiar verse of scripture. Acts
[38:20] chapter 1, let's start at verse 7.
[38:27] The Bible says, "And he said unto them,
[38:31] it is not for you to know the times or
[38:35] the seasons which the Father hath put in
[38:38] his own power, but ye shall receive
[38:41] power after the Holy Ghost is come upon
[38:45] you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me,
[38:49] both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and
[38:53] in Samaria, and unto the uttermost most
[38:57] part of the earth. Amen. May the Lord
[39:00] bless you reading of his word. You can
[39:02] have your seats.
[39:04] And as you're sitting, I I
[39:07] I'll come back to that. Amen. But um
[39:10] praise God for his word.
[39:12] Amen.
[39:13] You know, um as I look at the scripture,
[39:16] you know, and I think about this stage,
[39:18] my subject today is a greater
[39:20] experience.
[39:22] Amen.
[39:22] A greater experience. And you know what
[39:26] is an experience? Experience is
[39:27] something that you have taken a part of.
[39:31] See this this the worship service when
[39:33] you put that up online you know for
[39:36] those who may be streaming it and they
[39:37] were saying man that was a nice worship
[39:40] service you got a right to say but I
[39:42] experienced it
[39:43] because I was there.
[39:45] I was there hearing the music in my ear.
[39:47] I was there under the anointing. I can
[39:50] see the expressions and different things
[39:52] that are not shown until the camera gets
[39:54] on it.
[39:55] So by having an experience, you get
[39:58] details of things that somebody else
[40:00] might not know because they didn't have
[40:02] the experience.
[40:03] You know, uh you think about uh uh
[40:05] brother Aaron or Andrew or sister Dave,
[40:08] they're playing the instruments and
[40:09] different things. You know, as much as I
[40:11] would like to be able to play, I don't
[40:14] have the experience. Or maybe I want to
[40:16] be able to play the drums just as good
[40:18] as my brother or certain things, but I
[40:20] don't have the I can get up there and
[40:21] beat it.
[40:23] But you guys will look at me and say,
[40:24] "Get that man. He ain't got no
[40:25] experience."
[40:27] See, so the experience will tell
[40:29] Hallelujah. that there's another level
[40:31] of the thing you're dealing with.
[40:33] Hallelujah. You know, uh uh uh I have a
[40:36] I have a a a CDL uh driver's license, so
[40:40] I got more experience than you.
[40:42] Hallelujah. You might say, "Brother Jes,
[40:44] I can drive, but can you drive when I
[40:46] drive?"
[40:47] Hallelujah. Because I've been trained
[40:49] under a certain level of training to
[40:52] experience something greater.
[40:53] Hallelujah.
[40:54] So, it's not just an ordinary thing,
[40:56] church. And what I'm saying today, that
[40:59] for us as believers, there's a greater
[41:03] experience that we ought to be looking
[41:05] for.
[41:06] You say, "Brother D, what could be
[41:07] greater than what I am?" Well, look,
[41:09] let's let's look into it now. Uh uh what
[41:13] what should we be striving for?
[41:15] Yeah.
[41:15] The life. Hallelujah. Of Christ.
[41:18] That's what should that's what we should
[41:19] be striving for. We should be looking to
[41:21] see Christ in the mirror when we look in
[41:24] the mirror.
[41:25] When we walk, we should be seeing Christ
[41:27] in our walk. Christ in our talk. Christ
[41:30] in everything we do. Our life should be
[41:33] an experience of God.
[41:35] Amen.
[41:35] Hallelujah. See, and what bring me to
[41:38] this, Brother Diggs, is like, you know,
[41:39] we just had camp and the kids, no doubt,
[41:42] they've had a good experience.
[41:44] Some had I tell you one of my favorite
[41:46] experiences, boy, that was that canteen.
[41:48] Woo!
[41:50] That canteen was nothing to play with.
[41:52] Ain't it? That canteen was the real
[41:54] deal. Hallelujah. And I wanted to tell
[41:56] the sisters, hallelujah. Out of all the
[41:58] camps I've ever did, I've never
[42:00] experienced a canteen like that before.
[42:03] Hallelujah. But you know church, there
[42:05] were all kind of different experiences.
[42:07] Some people they they you know they love
[42:09] the bonfire. Some people love being in
[42:11] church and hearing the word and some
[42:13] people love just being a part of the
[42:14] choirs. But there were all kind of
[42:16] experiences going on.
[42:18] Amen. But those experiences as a whole
[42:22] produced a camp meeting.
[42:24] Hallelujah. So you know there some
[42:26] people may get the tapes and they'll be
[42:28] like, "Man, boy, we saw you at the
[42:29] campfire and y'all was singing higher,
[42:32] higher. Everybody was having a good
[42:33] time. Somebody in this church can say,
[42:35] "But I was there."
[42:38] Hallelujah.
[42:39] I was there. I experienced it.
[42:42] Hallelujah. You Somebody say, "Brother,
[42:44] brother John, brother Joshua Josh was
[42:46] preaching and you know the power of God.
[42:48] I can feel it in my house and somebody
[42:50] in here can say I was there."
[42:53] Amen.
[42:53] Hallelujah.
[42:56] So church, I hope you're catching the an
[42:58] experience of a thing is a whole another
[43:00] level. Amen.
[43:02] You know, uh you you know, I started
[43:04] thinking about a doctor. You know, uh a
[43:06] doctor that different levels of doctor,
[43:08] if I could, if this is a word,
[43:10] doctorship.
[43:13] I know. I know that ain't the correct
[43:14] word, but you teachers help me out.
[43:18] You know, there's there's certain Oh.
[43:20] Oh, doctorate. That's it, ain't it? I
[43:22] got a doctorate degree. That probably
[43:24] ain't it either. Let me let me just move
[43:26] on. But anyway there there are certain
[43:29] levels of having a degree
[43:32] and it's based upon your what
[43:34] experience. Hallelujah.
[43:35] So you know you can have two doctors
[43:38] sitting in the room with two kind of
[43:40] different experiences. You know they can
[43:42] sign both of them could sign their their
[43:44] their their check or whatever by doctor
[43:47] so and so Dr. So and so but their
[43:50] experiences will identify what kind of
[43:53] doctor they are.
[43:54] You know they call a dentist a doctor.
[43:56] They call a metal do medical doctor a
[43:59] doctor. You have a doctor of divinity.
[44:01] Hallelujah. Which separates all three of
[44:04] those people by their experience.
[44:06] You know, now the dentist can come in,
[44:08] hallelujah, and flex his muscles. And
[44:10] you can say, you know what, doc talking
[44:12] to the medical doctor, I'm a doctor,
[44:14] too. And that doctor will say, "But can
[44:16] you put a heart inside somebody?"
[44:21] His testimony might be like, "No, I
[44:22] can't." You know why he can't do it?
[44:24] because he hadn't had that experience.
[44:26] And you know what? Then the dentist can
[44:28] flex on him and he can say, "Well, can
[44:30] you do a root canal?"
[44:32] Come on.
[44:33] He was like, "No, but I can put a
[44:34] heart." He said, "No, can you do a root
[44:36] canal?" He's like, "No, I can't do a
[44:37] root canal."
[44:39] Why? Because he hadn't had the
[44:40] experience.
[44:42] So, a lot of times the experience
[44:44] separates the person.
[44:47] Hallelujah.
[44:49] But the greatest experience is to
[44:52] experience the life of Christ fully with
[44:55] no measure. Fully or should I say fully
[44:59] with no hindrances.
[45:01] Amen. That's what we want. We want an
[45:03] experience. What kind of experience? A
[45:06] Pentecostal experience.
[45:10] You know, a lot of people say Pentecost,
[45:12] we're beyond that, are we?
[45:16] Are we? We're beyond the Pentecostal
[45:20] denominational
[45:21] experience where tongues and the
[45:23] evidence and this and that tongues and
[45:25] and gifts and all these things. And
[45:27] praise God, we want to see those things
[45:29] moving in the church.
[45:30] And the prophet of God said that we
[45:33] should have all nine spiritual gifts
[45:36] moving in the church.
[45:37] Why we don't see it? Because of our
[45:40] experience.
[45:44] He said the gifts are there to keep the
[45:46] church clean. Hallelujah. So why aren't
[45:49] we laying before God and say, "Lord, use
[45:51] me in a way that you want to use me."
[45:54] Hallelujah. And let's get back.
[45:56] Hallelujah. When you take the
[45:57] Pentecostal experience, it's not about
[46:00] gifts.
[46:01] It's not about speaking in tongues.
[46:02] Hallelujah. Because hey, brothers,
[46:04] sisters, if you look down, sisters
[46:06] probably don't have it because sisters
[46:07] like the way slide ends and flats. But
[46:09] brothers, if you look down and look at
[46:11] your shoe, a tongue is a part of the
[46:13] shoe, but it's not the whole shoe.
[46:15] Amen. What gives you the experience? The
[46:18] whole shoot.
[46:19] Hallelujah.
[46:20] So we need the whole measure of God to
[46:23] experience who he is.
[46:25] And you know church some say well
[46:28] brother Digs you know I got excited. You
[46:30] need more than that.
[46:31] You say brother Digs I got healed. You
[46:33] need more than that.
[46:34] You say brother Digs I can understand
[46:36] the word. You need more than that.
[46:40] Amen.
[46:41] It has to come to a place where it
[46:43] changes your life. Yes. Amen.
[46:46] Give you a different experience.
[46:49] Hallelujah.
[46:50] Hallelujah.
[46:52] Oh my. Because there's a lot of people
[46:54] in church who have the experience of
[46:57] music, the experience of shouting and
[46:59] dancing, even the experience of gifts
[47:01] working in a true form.
[47:03] Amen.
[47:04] Hallelujah.
[47:05] But it still doesn't bring us to the
[47:07] life of Christ.
[47:09] And that's what we want. What kind of
[47:12] experience you talking about, Brother D?
[47:13] But let's go back and I'm going to bring
[47:15] out by the grace of God a key element
[47:17] that's holding up our experience.
[47:20] Wouldn't you want to know that?
[47:21] Amen.
[47:22] A key element that's probably messing
[47:23] with somebody in the room right now,
[47:25] hindering your experience, young and
[47:28] old. But you know, church, when I begin
[47:30] to think about uh the greatest
[47:32] experience, what was the greatest
[47:35] experience in the Bible?
[47:37] Acts 1, I mean Genesis 1:26.
[47:43] Man being created in the image of God,
[47:46] likeness of God. He had the person of
[47:49] God, the mannerisms of God. He
[47:51] experienced what God's very own nature.
[47:57] Adam could leave out of the garden
[47:59] saying, "Man, I know what it's like to
[48:02] be a God."
[48:05] Now, that's what you call a great
[48:06] experience.
[48:08] Amen. There's some men who say, "Well,
[48:10] you know, they've been worshiped as gods
[48:12] and and you know that people worship
[48:14] them and all these things, but not like
[48:15] Adam.
[48:17] There's a greater level to it."
[48:20] Are you with me, church?
[48:21] There's a greater experience, amen, than
[48:24] what we commonly call a God.
[48:27] Hallelujah. But let's look at Adam's
[48:28] experience, church. The Bible says that
[48:32] man was created in his image and
[48:34] likeness. Amen.
[48:36] Amen. Amen.
[48:38] Where my camp members at?
[48:42] Camp members were stirred up, you know.
[48:43] They were Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[48:46] Woo. Preach, my brother.
[48:49] Don't come there. Don't come back home
[48:50] and turn into a mannequin on me now.
[48:55] We don't want no mannequin worship
[48:57] today. Now, hallelujah. Let's close the
[48:59] blinds. We don't want to see no
[49:00] mannequin.
[49:02] Amen. We want to be touched by life.
[49:05] You know, you can dress a mannequin up.
[49:07] Amen. Make it look good. You can even
[49:09] desire what it got, but it'll never
[49:11] move.
[49:14] You can change the clothes of it, you
[49:16] know, and make it even look better the
[49:17] next day, but it still will never move.
[49:20] You know why? Because it has no life.
[49:24] Amen. So, I don't want to be a religious
[49:26] mannequin. Amen. I want I want the life
[49:29] of God flowing through my veins.
[49:34] He like, "All right, brother D, you all
[49:36] right, brother D. You just trying to get
[49:37] us excited."
[49:39] And is
[49:43] cuz God's been good to us, church.
[49:46] He's been good to us.
[49:48] When are we going to express that?
[49:50] Amen. We shouldn't have to wait to a
[49:52] meeting or special service or this and
[49:53] that. Soon as God wake us up, praise
[49:55] God, I'm alive.
[49:57] Praise God, I'm alive.
[50:00] Hallelujah.
[50:01] But you think about it. You know, y'all
[50:03] know me. I ain't going to be long. I'm
[50:04] about to close.
[50:07] But if you think about it, Adam, what?
[50:10] Look at this level of life. You know,
[50:13] God created man in his image.
[50:16] Amen.
[50:16] In his likeness.
[50:18] So, Adam looked just like God
[50:21] talked like God.
[50:22] And this is what I want us to catch. He
[50:24] had the mind of God.
[50:29] Woo. That's the kind of level he was on.
[50:31] When he thought he thought the same
[50:34] thoughts as God would think,
[50:36] boy, that's heavy, ain't it?
[50:38] When he thought, he thought the same
[50:40] thoughts that God would think.
[50:43] Now, wouldn't you want to experience
[50:44] that?
[50:45] When you think, it's not your thoughts,
[50:47] but it's his thoughts.
[50:49] But look, church, God has given us a
[50:51] right to get there. He said, "Let this
[50:53] mind be in you."
[50:56] He wants us to experience it.
[51:02] Oh my. And he constantly tells us and he
[51:04] he challenges us and God will come and
[51:06] say, "Hey, my thoughts are not like your
[51:08] thoughts. My ways are not your way."
[51:11] What is he showing us? There's a greater
[51:12] level.
[51:15] Hallelujah. But look, we get to Adam and
[51:17] I mean, we get to Adam and Adam, you
[51:19] know, he's in the Garden of Eden and,
[51:21] you know, everything is wonderful and
[51:23] his experience is so great. God God, and
[51:26] we didn't heard this before. God creates
[51:28] everything and he brings it to Adam.
[51:31] Wow. What an experience.
[51:34] Hallelujah. God brings the lions, the
[51:36] tigers, the bears, everything to Adam
[51:39] and he say, "I want you to name it."
[51:40] Hallelujah. You know, uh, you know, I've
[51:42] been to Africa and I've seen the 9 foot
[51:44] lions. Hallelujah. And you know, and it
[51:47] just blows me away. It makes me uh
[51:50] realize realize more and more. Hallelu
[51:54] Chris. It makes me realize more and more
[51:56] that the lions in Riverbank Zoo in
[51:59] Colombia, they on dope.
[52:07] They on dope.
[52:09] They didn't been tranquilized.
[52:11] And you walk in and they like this.
[52:16] like I just got hit. I just got a shot.
[52:20] And they ain't even growling. They ain't
[52:22] even walking. They just sit there. Most
[52:23] of the time they just licking their paw.
[52:27] Ain't doing nothing.
[52:28] But you know what God did? God showed me
[52:31] that there's another level to the lion.
[52:36] Hallelujah. That this lion's in the
[52:38] African. Hallelujah. In in South Africa.
[52:40] Hallelujah. Big 9 foot lion's church.
[52:43] when he stretches out one time the
[52:45] trainer, this this guy who was dealing
[52:47] with now, you know, uh uh he got an
[52:49] experience that I ain't got.
[52:53] He walk out there among them, he pat
[52:55] them, he dy do all kind of stuff, throw
[52:58] them meat, all the stuff. I'm sitting on
[52:59] the bus behind the cage.
[53:03] Are we having the same experience? No.
[53:06] I'm there, but we're having different
[53:08] experiences.
[53:10] Don't just be a person that's here. have
[53:12] the real experience.
[53:16] Now, if I would have been able to get
[53:18] out that cave, and it's going to happen
[53:19] one day. Hallelujah. If I was able to
[53:22] get off that bus, walk down there, and
[53:23] say, "Simba, come to me. I'm a son of
[53:26] God."
[53:28] That's who Adam was.
[53:31] This man, this trainer, he was imitating
[53:33] Adam.
[53:35] Think about it. And he may not even know
[53:36] who Adam was, but in this in this stage,
[53:40] he got the same testimony as Adam.
[53:45] Oh boy, I feel my helper coming on.
[53:49] Hallelujah.
[53:50] Church, you think about it. Hallelujah.
[53:52] You know, this man is operating in a
[53:54] level that the ordinary man can't
[53:56] operate in.
[53:59] Why? Because he's raised those lions up.
[54:01] They know him. They know his person.
[54:02] They know what he smell like and
[54:04] everything. And you know they see
[54:05] somebody like me, they be like,
[54:08] "Dark meat."
[54:11] But the same man who's a man just like
[54:13] me, because of his experience separates
[54:17] how the animal looks at me and looks at
[54:20] him. Hallelujah. Your experience will
[54:23] separate you from how God deals with you
[54:25] and how he deals with the regular
[54:27] church.
[54:31] Hallelujah.
[54:32] Church, we've got we've become to know
[54:34] him
[54:35] in the power of the resurrection.
[54:38] Oh my.
[54:39] Church, I seen this man. He was feeding.
[54:41] He was playing with the lion and he went
[54:43] on the bus and went to the highest
[54:45] window and put the meat out there and
[54:48] that lion stretched out all the way up.
[54:51] He came all the way up to the window.
[54:55] And you want to tell me that's the same
[54:56] thing in my zoo?
[55:01] certain parts where you can go through
[55:03] where you can drive through
[55:05] but I guarantee you you won't get out
[55:06] your car.
[55:09] Hallelujah. And you know we we driving
[55:11] through and one of them he jumped on top
[55:13] of the car
[55:15] and basically he was like saying y'all
[55:17] better be glad y'all inside that car.
[55:20] Don't come making a mockery out of me. I
[55:22] don't belong in these cages. Hallelujah.
[55:24] But you know church it was the
[55:26] experience of the thing and you know I
[55:28] was like wow man this was this is
[55:30] powerful but what I want you to
[55:32] understand I was experiencing something
[55:35] powerful but you know what was
[55:37] accompanying me the whole time? Fear
[55:45] and that's the greatest hindrance in the
[55:47] church.
[55:49] Fear. Satan wants us to fear even though
[55:53] we're experiencing supernatural things.
[55:57] The difference between that man and Adam
[55:59] was that man said, "Hey now, I'm here
[56:02] among the lions, but I'll never be able
[56:04] to trust them." He said, "Don't you
[56:05] trust them cuz at any minute they'll
[56:07] turn on you." H, you think Adam was
[56:10] worried about a lion turning on him? No.
[56:12] Adam had no fear.
[56:15] That's the level of experience we want,
[56:17] church. Hallelujah. Well, we operate as
[56:19] sons and daughters of God without any
[56:21] fear.
[56:23] And when there's no fear, all things are
[56:25] possible.
[56:27] [Applause]
[56:29] Hallelujah.
[56:31] Oh my
[56:33] church.
[56:35] I'll go back to it again. I've seen a a
[56:39] a tiger, wild tiger in the wild and
[56:42] different things and and the tiger's a
[56:45] little bit close. He his his his meds
[56:47] must be ain't as strong as the lion meds
[56:50] because the lion he ain't doing nothing
[56:52] at the zoo. He just sitting there
[56:54] looking like when y'all going to feed me
[56:58] and he probably eating baked chicken.
[57:01] He ain't eating the real stuff. So he
[57:03] wouldn't be able to survive in the wild.
[57:05] Why? Because of his experience.
[57:09] You put him out there way in his natural
[57:12] habitat, he'll die. Why? because of how
[57:15] he was raised.
[57:18] Oh my church. But God, hallelujah, he
[57:21] made us alive. And there are people
[57:23] who's left the message and pull away.
[57:25] Why? Because of how they were raised.
[57:28] And I'm talking about in the word now.
[57:30] I'm not talking about your house, your
[57:31] church, nothing. I'm talking about your
[57:33] experience with God. What kind of
[57:35] experience do you have? That's right.
[57:39] And I'll say to you, if it doesn't match
[57:41] up to Adam or Jesus Christ, you got
[57:44] another level.
[57:47] Because the prophet said all that Adam
[57:49] lost, Christ did what? He restored it
[57:52] back to the believer.
[57:55] So what he was saying was when you see
[57:58] when you saw Adam, you saw me.
[58:00] And then Jesus comes and he says when
[58:02] you see me, you see the father.
[58:04] Hallelujah. Now, what should I see in
[58:06] your experience? Just a good church
[58:09] member. Oh, no. There's another level.
[58:12] There's another level. And you know, but
[58:14] let's look at it, church. Everybody all
[58:16] right?
[58:17] Look, church. Adam was a god. Eve was a
[58:21] god in the garden. Everything did their
[58:24] bidding. Everything was subject to their
[58:26] voices. Even they had communion with
[58:30] God. God came down in the cool of the
[58:32] day. Did they run? No.
[58:35] Were they afraid? No. Did they wonder if
[58:39] this is God's voice? No. You know why?
[58:42] Because there was no fear.
[58:45] The first attribute of sin is what?
[58:48] Fear.
[58:51] Because after they committed the act,
[58:53] the next thing you know, God and his
[58:54] faithfulness, he came down. And what
[58:57] they did? They ran.
[59:01] Fear is in the church now. Amen.
[59:04] Even in the presence of the
[59:06] supernatural.
[59:09] Cuz look, the mighty God came down in
[59:12] all his faithfulness like he like he
[59:15] normally does,
[59:17] ready to have communion with his
[59:18] creation.
[59:20] But because they have fear in their
[59:21] heart, they ran from that fellowship.
[59:26] God wants to put you back in his
[59:28] presence. Why are we so afraid?
[59:33] Your fear is a product
[59:35] of the fall.
[59:40] But I'm here.
[59:42] I want to shed some light on fear and
[59:45] what it does.
[59:47] Amen. And I I ain't going to dig too
[59:50] much in it because I don't want to get
[59:52] the devil no credit. Before I go any
[59:55] further, I'mma tell you,
[59:58] we gonna destroy fear right quick.
[1:00:01] Amen. Before I even go any further, I'm
[1:00:03] going to tell you right now, fear is not
[1:00:06] real.
[1:00:10] You say, "Bro, I'm afraid." That's your
[1:00:12] imagination.
[1:00:14] [Applause]
[1:00:16] He say, "Brother D, if I touch this,
[1:00:18] it's going to burn me." That's your
[1:00:19] memory.
[1:00:21] Hallelujah. The prophet of God said,
[1:00:23] "There are two things you operate by.
[1:00:25] Faith and fear or faith and doubt."
[1:00:28] Hallelujah. And doubt and fear is the
[1:00:30] same thing.
[1:00:31] Hallelujah. But what if I to tell you
[1:00:33] right now that the attributes of sin are
[1:00:36] not even real?
[1:00:39] Amen.
[1:00:40] You'll say, "Brother D, you crazy. I'm
[1:00:42] going through this. I've seen people
[1:00:43] with cast. I've seen all this this and
[1:00:44] that." Okay. Well, I fight that
[1:00:46] statement with this. Hallelujah.
[1:00:50] Hallelujah. Look,
[1:00:53] in order for anything to be real, it has
[1:00:56] to be a creation.
[1:00:59] Amen.
[1:01:00] Is sin a creation?
[1:01:02] No.
[1:01:04] So if it's not a creation, how is it
[1:01:06] real?
[1:01:09] Because the only one that can create is
[1:01:10] who? God.
[1:01:12] Hallelujah.
[1:01:13] And for Satan to be able to create that
[1:01:15] makes him what? A God.
[1:01:18] Hallelujah. So everything you take fear
[1:01:20] and faith, Hallelujah. Fear, Amen, is a
[1:01:23] is a is a is a is a is a is a byproduct
[1:01:26] of faith. Amen. It's a perversion of
[1:01:28] faith. Hallelujah. What does it do? It
[1:01:31] twistes up the real thing.
[1:01:33] See, it's not a creation. Amen.
[1:01:36] It's something made up in the mind of
[1:01:39] the human.
[1:01:41] Amen.
[1:01:44] If you operate in faith, it'll never
[1:01:46] exist.
[1:01:49] Oh boy. We snatching it from him today.
[1:01:52] We killing that devil today. Hallelujah.
[1:01:55] Hallelujah. You mean to tell me cancer
[1:01:57] is not real? No.
[1:02:00] Hallelujah. You have to accept it. You
[1:02:02] have to make it what it is.
[1:02:04] Hallelujah. It becomes a life when you
[1:02:07] receive it as a spirit or you receive it
[1:02:09] as a thought first.
[1:02:11] Amen. Cuz what is cancer? Cancer is a
[1:02:13] perversion of healing.
[1:02:17] It's not a creation.
[1:02:18] Amen.
[1:02:19] And if it wasn't created, where can it
[1:02:21] stand? Yeah,
[1:02:25] he has no he has no ground to stand
[1:02:26] upon.
[1:02:28] And I know some of y'all got your minds
[1:02:30] thinking and you thinking like I don't
[1:02:32] know.
[1:02:35] I don't know about that.
[1:02:41] Well, I say unto you,
[1:02:44] hallelujah,
[1:02:46] if you go back to the Garden of Eden,
[1:02:49] where did fear come from?
[1:02:52] It wasn't a part of the original
[1:02:53] creation.
[1:02:55] Cuz the Bible say God created all things
[1:02:57] and then he did what? He rested.
[1:03:00] Hallelujah. Then the fall came. Then
[1:03:03] fear came and they started running from
[1:03:05] God. And from that point on, Amen. Fear
[1:03:07] was in the church
[1:03:09] turning our minds to believe in the
[1:03:11] things that are not true.
[1:03:14] Amen.
[1:03:16] Oh my. And you know, one of the one of
[1:03:19] the symbolisms of fear is what? False
[1:03:22] evidences
[1:03:24] appearing real.
[1:03:27] Amen.
[1:03:29] And if God could just get us to look at
[1:03:32] what he's done, these other elements
[1:03:34] won't even exist.
[1:03:36] Why? Because they have no creative
[1:03:38] substance.
[1:03:40] Look, you say, "Well, oh, brother D, I
[1:03:42] know somebody who died from cancer. How
[1:03:43] did it happen? It was bruised by cells
[1:03:46] that were already created.
[1:03:49] Hallelujah.
[1:03:51] Oh, brother D, I I had a fever. I had a
[1:03:53] this. I had a that. You already had a
[1:03:55] temperature. Then something got in and
[1:03:57] infected that temperature and started
[1:03:59] making it go a different way.
[1:04:02] I can go on and on with stuff like that
[1:04:04] to show you that. Hallelujah. The
[1:04:06] attributes of sin is a perversion which
[1:04:09] fear brings about.
[1:04:11] But who are we without fear? Come on.
[1:04:14] Oh my. Who are you without fear? Amen.
[1:04:18] You're who Adam was.
[1:04:20] You're who Jesus is.
[1:04:22] Oh my.
[1:04:24] But if if if if I can, I want to show
[1:04:27] you how close a person can walk with God
[1:04:32] and still have an element of fear in
[1:04:34] their life.
[1:04:35] That's why I'm preaching there's another
[1:04:37] level. And if I could just make it real
[1:04:39] plain and simple. You say, "Brother D,
[1:04:41] another level." Yeah.
[1:04:43] The justified saints had to make room
[1:04:45] for what? The sanctified saints.
[1:04:48] The sanctified saints had to make room
[1:04:49] for what? The gifts. And then the Holy
[1:04:52] Spirit comes. But then the prophet stops
[1:04:54] and says, "Hey, there's another level."
[1:04:57] Not just receiving the Holy Ghost, but
[1:05:00] he says the Holy Ghost makes room for
[1:05:03] the Holy Ghost himself.
[1:05:06] Hallelujah. See, Christ restored back in
[1:05:09] the believer. It's a real true life
[1:05:12] experience.
[1:05:14] Amen. Cuz some people can be justified
[1:05:17] and not be sanctified.
[1:05:20] And some people can be sanctified and
[1:05:22] not know they justified.
[1:05:24] But once you get that life, hallelujah.
[1:05:27] It it changes from the inside out.
[1:05:30] It changes the whole purpose. It it
[1:05:32] becomes what? A lifechanging experience.
[1:05:39] Because what the Holy Ghost does, the
[1:05:41] Holy Ghost begins to fight the battles
[1:05:43] you can't fight.
[1:05:44] Hallelujah. Because those spirits come
[1:05:46] back around. But now there's a strong
[1:05:48] man inside
[1:05:49] that says, "No, this house don't belong
[1:05:51] to you.
[1:05:52] This house has been taken over."
[1:05:53] Hallelujah. I don't know about y'all,
[1:05:55] but somebody else living in my house.
[1:06:02] Think about it.
[1:06:04] Think about Moses being there when the
[1:06:07] death angel was coming and he was wiping
[1:06:10] out all the firstborn.
[1:06:12] Wiping them out, wiping them out. Moses
[1:06:14] can say, "I was there. I experienced
[1:06:17] that.
[1:06:18] I know what it's like to live through
[1:06:20] that, church." And we're here in the
[1:06:22] last church age, and we're seeing these
[1:06:24] scriptures being fulfilled. We're here
[1:06:26] experiencing the last days.
[1:06:29] Hallelujah. We're here experiencing the
[1:06:32] full restoration of the church.
[1:06:35] Oh my. Oh my. But I want to take a
[1:06:38] believer
[1:06:40] probably that we all can identify with.
[1:06:43] And I want to show you how close he
[1:06:46] walked to the Lord, but he still had
[1:06:49] another level to go. And he might not
[1:06:52] have realized it in that moment, but he
[1:06:55] did. And what I love about God,
[1:06:58] he won't stop until he sees his
[1:07:00] reflection.
[1:07:04] So the little coffin and cold and all
[1:07:06] that stuff we going through,
[1:07:09] there's more to come.
[1:07:12] Let's just have the right attitude.
[1:07:15] Let's just tell the devil, I ain't going
[1:07:16] to stop. I ain't going to stop church. I
[1:07:18] ain't going to stop singing, worshiping.
[1:07:20] You can fight me all you want. If I die,
[1:07:22] I die believing God. Oh yeah.
[1:07:24] Oh, brother Jesus, I ain't ready to die.
[1:07:27] Why not?
[1:07:29] How long you want to live here?
[1:07:31] It ain't going to get no better.
[1:07:34] Hallelujah.
[1:07:36] I don't know about you, I'm ready to go.
[1:07:38] Amen.
[1:07:39] I'm ready to be with the Lord.
[1:07:41] I'm ready to experience. I don't know
[1:07:42] about y'all, but think about it. Have
[1:07:44] you experienced the streets of gold?
[1:07:48] Think about that. You We'll be walking
[1:07:50] on gold streets. Stop.
[1:07:52] Oh man, you talking about lightening up.
[1:07:55] Your feet might be lighting up as you
[1:07:57] walking.
[1:07:59] You don't need them shoes with lights on
[1:08:00] them rolling.
[1:08:02] You going to need that.
[1:08:05] It's It's another level, church.
[1:08:08] Hallelujah. But look, I want to talk
[1:08:10] about a man named Peter.
[1:08:13] Peter was called by God. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:17] He was called to be a disciple. And you
[1:08:20] know one thing about Peter, Peter looked
[1:08:22] like a real man of God. Amen. And I
[1:08:25] don't believe he was faking. And he was
[1:08:27] just being what he was in those moments.
[1:08:29] Amen. But look, church, Peter,
[1:08:31] Hallelujah. He walked with God. He seen
[1:08:34] signs and wonders, supernatural. Amen.
[1:08:36] Feeding, feeding uh people, healing the
[1:08:39] sick, raising the dead. Even members of
[1:08:42] his family were touched by Jesus.
[1:08:47] Peter could say,
[1:08:49] Peter could tell Paul, "You know what? I
[1:08:52] was there,
[1:08:55] I was there when when when we when we
[1:08:58] fed the 5,000,
[1:09:00] not once, but twice."
[1:09:03] What an experience. Look, church, he was
[1:09:05] so close. Amen. He grabbed He grabbed
[1:09:08] the the fish and the bread from the
[1:09:11] little boy, gave it to Jesus. He was the
[1:09:13] go-between. Giving it to Jesus and see
[1:09:16] Jesus break the bread. Then Jesus give
[1:09:18] it back to him and they give it to the
[1:09:20] people. Give it to Jes. Break the bread.
[1:09:22] Give it back to them. Break the bread.
[1:09:24] Give See how close he was church. He
[1:09:26] experience the breaking of the bread.
[1:09:32] Oh my. What an experience.
[1:09:41] And church just being there seeing all
[1:09:44] the things that Christ did. He He was
[1:09:46] there when Christ was out on the shore.
[1:09:49] Hallelujah. In the boat speaking to the
[1:09:51] people and everybody on the on the shore
[1:09:53] side listening. And you know what?
[1:09:55] Christ didn't have a microphone.
[1:10:01] Look at the detail.
[1:10:03] And you you done been you done been
[1:10:05] beside the ocean. It ain't it ain't
[1:10:07] quiet. No.
[1:10:13] And I don't believe Jesus was up there
[1:10:15] screaming like me.
[1:10:18] He was just talking to the people
[1:10:20] and the word was
[1:10:22] going out touching the people's heart.
[1:10:25] It was believers who experienced that.
[1:10:28] The voice of God being direct like a
[1:10:31] torpedo
[1:10:35] before technology,
[1:10:37] before microphones,
[1:10:39] there are people who experience that.
[1:10:42] Peter was there watching it.
[1:10:48] Church
[1:10:49] look
[1:10:51] being that close still had an element of
[1:10:54] fear in him. See
[1:10:57] you know all that's supernatural.
[1:10:59] Look look look look look
[1:11:03] Jesus get to a place he say who do men
[1:11:07] say I am
[1:11:10] some say doubt the Christ.
[1:11:13] No some say you're John the Baptist.
[1:11:15] Some say you're Elias or one of the
[1:11:17] prophets. Then Jesus zeros in. He says
[1:11:20] who do you say I am?
[1:11:22] Now Peter finished showing he revelated.
[1:11:25] Good.
[1:11:28] Not only is he healing the sick, raising
[1:11:30] the dead, feeding 5,000, but now he's
[1:11:33] going to show he's revelated. He know
[1:11:35] this word. He know who Christ is.
[1:11:38] Now you going to show he's revelated. He
[1:11:39] say, "Thou art the Christ."
[1:11:42] You know how we do people? We say, "You
[1:11:43] believe in God?" Of course I do.
[1:11:47] You ask Car believe in God. She Thank
[1:11:48] you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus, for my
[1:11:50] award. Praise the Lord. Jesus is my
[1:11:53] savior.
[1:11:54] I ain't got nothing to get you caught,
[1:11:56] but there's another level.
[1:12:01] Hallelujah.
[1:12:03] Oh, when Billy Is got her award, she
[1:12:06] said, "Thank you to my savior. I ain't
[1:12:08] got nothing against you, Billy, but
[1:12:09] there's another level.
[1:12:13] A level of a life.
[1:12:14] [Applause]
[1:12:16] Not just an acknowledgment of a savior,
[1:12:18] but allowing him to save."
[1:12:22] Amen. Cuz
[1:12:25] y'all know what we all done watch these
[1:12:28] award shows.
[1:12:31] If you haven't, I'll tell you.
[1:12:40] But first thing they do is they say, "I
[1:12:42] want to thank my Lord and Savior."
[1:12:46] What separates them from us? Our
[1:12:48] experience.
[1:12:50] Amen.
[1:12:51] What kind of experience? Holy Ghost
[1:12:53] experience.
[1:12:54] Hallelujah.
[1:12:54] Where you surrender your life.
[1:12:56] Hallelujah. To live for Christ.
[1:13:00] Hallelujah. There's a lot of people can
[1:13:01] acknowledge that he's God. There's a lot
[1:13:03] of people can acknowledge him as savior.
[1:13:05] But can you let him live through you?
[1:13:09] That's a whole another level.
[1:13:13] Amen.
[1:13:15] But now here's Peter. Peter says, Peter
[1:13:17] says, "Thou art the Christ, the son of
[1:13:20] the living God." Amen.
[1:13:21] And this is what Jesus said. Jesus said,
[1:13:23] "Peter,
[1:13:25] flesh and blood have not revealed that
[1:13:27] for you."
[1:13:28] Amen.
[1:13:28] But my father which is in heaven. Now
[1:13:30] catch this. Peter had direct contact
[1:13:33] with the inspiration of God.
[1:13:38] Direct contact.
[1:13:41] And then Jesus said, "Upon this I'm
[1:13:43] going to build my church and the gates
[1:13:45] of hell say stand against it."
[1:13:49] That's Peter.
[1:13:52] Okay.
[1:13:54] He had a good experience, didn't he?
[1:13:57] Did y'all know what still had fear in
[1:13:59] his life?
[1:14:02] There was another level for Peter.
[1:14:05] You know
[1:14:07] Jesus out of all that Peter healing the
[1:14:09] sick, raised the dead, feeding 5,000,
[1:14:11] doing do seeing doing all seeing blinded
[1:14:14] eyes, come on, deaf ears, all the stuff.
[1:14:16] Peter saw all of us and he even said,
[1:14:18] "Thou art the Christ." He revelated all
[1:14:20] that and then when pressure comes
[1:14:27] now it's going to show what his real
[1:14:29] experience is.
[1:14:31] Pressure comes and they say he say um
[1:14:34] Jesus say oh my Jesus say y'all know
[1:14:36] what on the third day I'm I'mma give my
[1:14:38] life. He said I'm going to give my life
[1:14:40] in three days I'm going to rise. Peter
[1:14:42] says the revelated one now
[1:14:44] the revelated healing the sick raising
[1:14:47] the dead disciple. He says to Jesus,
[1:14:49] "Lord, you shall not surely die."
[1:14:53] You mean to tell me a person like that
[1:14:56] can turn around right there and be
[1:14:58] anointed by a devil?
[1:15:02] Amen.
[1:15:05] He went from being revelated and all the
[1:15:07] kings of the kingdom and everything.
[1:15:09] Jesus looked at him and say, "Get behind
[1:15:11] me, Satan." Amen.
[1:15:14] A man that experienced all this
[1:15:16] supernatural stuff could still be
[1:15:18] anointed by evil spirit. Why? Because
[1:15:21] the life wasn't there yet.
[1:15:24] Amen.
[1:15:25] And now church, he gets to the place
[1:15:27] where he tells the Lord, he says, "No,
[1:15:29] Lord, you Peter said, "Get behind me,
[1:15:31] S." I mean, God said, "Get behind me,
[1:15:33] Satan."
[1:15:34] But Peter wasn't done. You know, Jesus
[1:15:37] said, "Nobody take my life. I lay it
[1:15:41] down
[1:15:42] cuz he wasn't afraid.
[1:15:45] They came with stabs and swords and
[1:15:47] knives. Jesus like, "Who? Y'all ain't
[1:15:49] coming to get no thug?
[1:15:53] I ain't no thug. I ain't no gang banger.
[1:15:59] I'm the Lord." He said, "Y'all can't
[1:16:02] take my lay down." And to prove that,
[1:16:04] they said somebody got inspired and they
[1:16:06] say, "You know what? Let's go get him.
[1:16:09] Let's throw them off the cliff. But it
[1:16:10] was no scripture for that.
[1:16:13] Stop letting the devil do things to you
[1:16:14] that are not scripture.
[1:16:18] Hallelujah. Ain't no scripture that I
[1:16:20] got to die cancer.
[1:16:22] Ain't no scripture that I got to have uh
[1:16:24] diabetes. Ain't no scripture that I got
[1:16:27] to be heartbroken, have high blood.
[1:16:29] Ain't no scripture that I got to be
[1:16:31] depressed in church or depressed in my
[1:16:33] marriage. Amen.
[1:16:36] Stop receiving those thoughts of fear.
[1:16:40] Amen.
[1:16:42] Oh my.
[1:16:45] But you know what they did experience?
[1:16:48] They said, "Oh, we going to throw him
[1:16:49] off a cliff."
[1:16:51] Jesus looked at them and walked right
[1:16:54] through them.
[1:16:56] They were grabbing ghosts.
[1:16:59] He walked right through them. Why they
[1:17:01] couldn't touch him? cuz there was no
[1:17:03] fear in him.
[1:17:06] He wasn't afraid. He wasn't afraid of
[1:17:07] the cliff and he wasn't afraid of him.
[1:17:09] He walked right through. And in another
[1:17:10] place, let me tell you something else
[1:17:12] Peter saw. He said, "Who do y'all come
[1:17:13] for?" They said, "Jesus or not?" He
[1:17:15] said, "I'm him."
[1:17:19] I can go way down south. He say, "Here I
[1:17:24] come get me." And the Bible say all of
[1:17:26] them fell back.
[1:17:28] Jesus said, "Let's make this real clear.
[1:17:30] Y'all can't touch me unless I want to be
[1:17:32] touched. He asked him again after they
[1:17:34] dusted their self off, got back up. He
[1:17:36] said, "Who you come for?" They said,
[1:17:37] "Jesus now." He said, "I am here." And
[1:17:40] they fell out again.
[1:17:42] Hallelujah. Church, there were a group
[1:17:44] of people there who had an experience to
[1:17:46] say, "We can't touch him unless he wants
[1:17:49] to be touched."
[1:17:52] And you ought to feel privileged if God
[1:17:54] has allowed you to get close to him. If
[1:17:56] you got close to him, it's because he
[1:17:59] wanted you to get close.
[1:18:01] Amen.
[1:18:02] Amen.
[1:18:05] Just like the woman, hallelujah, with
[1:18:06] the alabaster box. She came through the
[1:18:08] back door, pressed through everybody,
[1:18:10] and she touched him. Hallelujah.
[1:18:12] Started washing, hallelujah, his feet
[1:18:14] and everything. And they told Jesus, "If
[1:18:16] you knew what manner of woman that was,
[1:18:18] blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[1:18:20] touch." If he didn't want to be touched,
[1:18:21] she couldn't have touched him.
[1:18:24] But he loves to be worshiped.
[1:18:29] But you see Peter
[1:18:31] now he Jesus they come to get Jesus. And
[1:18:35] the same one who didn't heal the sick,
[1:18:37] raise the dead, look look like a pretty
[1:18:39] good saint. Now Jesus didn't told him
[1:18:41] say I lay my life down. Nobody take it.
[1:18:44] Peter look like a real good saint. They
[1:18:45] come to get Jesus. Peter say I can't
[1:18:47] take it.
[1:18:50] Bible say cut the ear off. Now
[1:18:52] you can believe what you want.
[1:18:54] I don't think the precision was that
[1:18:56] good where he said I'm going to just cut
[1:18:57] off a ear today.
[1:18:59] I'm I'm in ear mood.
[1:19:02] I'm in ear mood. Uh tomorrow I might cut
[1:19:05] a neck off but today I think I'm going
[1:19:07] to do a ear. No, church. I think he
[1:19:10] wanted a neck.
[1:19:12] But the grace of God hallelujah. The
[1:19:15] grace of God standing there. Hallelujah.
[1:19:18] To make his wrongs right.
[1:19:21] Look at the anger in that man.
[1:19:24] Hallelujah.
[1:19:25] Hallelujah. The aggression in that man
[1:19:28] who helped feed 5,000.
[1:19:31] Who healed the sick and raised the dead?
[1:19:33] Wasn't he dead when Jesus called Tabatha
[1:19:35] back also? Hallelujah.
[1:19:39] He was there.
[1:19:41] I believe he was also there. Amen. When
[1:19:44] Jesus called Lazarus back.
[1:19:47] Hallelujah. See the man that was
[1:19:48] stanking dead four days
[1:19:53] and Jesus said Lazarus come forth. He
[1:19:55] was there to experience the
[1:19:57] resurrection.
[1:20:00] And now
[1:20:03] listen, now we're getting down into the
[1:20:06] depths of it.
[1:20:08] Now they come get the Lord. They take
[1:20:10] the Lord away.
[1:20:13] Peter still following from afar
[1:20:16] because it looked like Jesus was
[1:20:18] untouchable, right? But now their master
[1:20:20] has gone into captive and have fears
[1:20:23] over the whole church. All the things
[1:20:26] that they experienced is now consumed in
[1:20:28] fear. And now they walking but they
[1:20:32] really ain't walking. They looking but
[1:20:34] they trying not to look because they
[1:20:35] don't want to be identified.
[1:20:37] And somebody say they go when I'm right
[1:20:38] there. Peter say not me. What happened
[1:20:41] to the feeding of the 5000? Thou art the
[1:20:44] Christ and
[1:20:45] Lord, I feed your sheep wherever you
[1:20:47] want me. All that stuff Peter was
[1:20:49] saying. What happened?
[1:20:52] That's another level.
[1:20:57] Let me say it like this. Ain't nothing
[1:20:59] wrong with this message.
[1:21:01] Ain't nothing wrong with the Bible.
[1:21:04] Could it be that people hadn't gone deep
[1:21:06] enough in God?
[1:21:09] Peter said, "I don't know. I'm I ain't
[1:21:11] had nothing to do with it. Don't get
[1:21:12] nervous. I'm about to close.
[1:21:15] I a I had nothing to do with it." And
[1:21:17] then somebody just, you know, Peter
[1:21:18] walking still look a little bit somebody
[1:21:21] come somebody else come up and say,
[1:21:22] "There you go." That's one of them.
[1:21:23] Peter said, "I don't know. I I ain't no
[1:21:27] I ain't a part of that thing now." I
[1:21:30] thought he said earlier to God, "Thou
[1:21:32] art the Christ."
[1:21:34] Amen.
[1:21:37] I thought Jesus told him, "I'mma build
[1:21:39] my church upon this."
[1:21:43] See what feared us. But he wasn't done.
[1:21:47] One more person came and say, "You know
[1:21:49] what? I don't care what nobody say. That
[1:21:52] guy right there, that was one of his
[1:21:54] right hand." Him, the one right there.
[1:21:57] You like me? Yeah. You, he walk with
[1:21:59] him, y'all. He was. You sow it. I
[1:22:05] Peter started cursing like a sailor.
[1:22:09] The Bible say he cursed and swore.
[1:22:12] Boy, now that's a nasty mouth right
[1:22:13] there, boy.
[1:22:16] He doubt when it did do him no good.
[1:22:19] Y'all know what he needed? He needed
[1:22:21] dove.
[1:22:26] Come on, y'all. Y'all ain't catch that
[1:22:27] dove. Come on y'all.
[1:22:33] Oh my.
[1:22:36] The Bible say he cursed and swore and
[1:22:39] Jesus said before the crow three times
[1:22:41] you going to deny me. Peter said not me
[1:22:43] God. Not me. That's him previously. Not
[1:22:46] me. I'm a soldier and I'm in the army of
[1:22:48] the Lord. I didn't been to the
[1:22:51] tabernacle. I done seen Sunset Mount. I
[1:22:53] don't believe this message. Next thing
[1:22:55] you know
[1:22:57] M
[1:23:01] cursing everybody
[1:23:03] just to say I know not the man
[1:23:07] Peter there's another level
[1:23:12] Peter get discouraged
[1:23:16] Jesus can you imagine looking at Jesus
[1:23:18] when that co start cord
[1:23:20] [Applause]
[1:23:25] but I want you to catch Just look at the
[1:23:27] type
[1:23:30] all the things that people Peter was
[1:23:32] portraying
[1:23:34] to walk with the church and supernatural
[1:23:36] and all these things is a evening time
[1:23:39] believer.
[1:23:42] Because the crawler caught went in the
[1:23:44] morning.
[1:23:45] So Jesus was saying in the evening time
[1:23:48] you'll see this in your churches.
[1:23:50] You will see a man who can walk with the
[1:23:52] Lord and do the supernatural and
[1:23:54] everything and still deny me.
[1:23:57] But he said when the morning when it's
[1:23:59] all over, only the true believer will
[1:24:01] stand.
[1:24:02] Hallelujah.
[1:24:03] So don't be dismayed by the things you
[1:24:05] might see. Yeah, we're in the evening
[1:24:07] time, but I don't know about you, but
[1:24:09] I'mma be there when that cross start to
[1:24:11] cry. Hallelujah. And I'm going to be
[1:24:12] there looking like Christ want me to
[1:24:14] look.
[1:24:16] Hallelujah. But the thing about the
[1:24:18] whole thing, what the scripture we read,
[1:24:21] Jesus said, Satan desire to s you as
[1:24:23] weak. But when he told Peter, "But I
[1:24:25] have prayed for thee."
[1:24:28] Oh my. Jesus knew he wasn't going to
[1:24:30] deny him. Jesus knew he wasn't going to
[1:24:32] lie. Jesus knew he was angry. And God
[1:24:35] let him do it.
[1:24:37] Why? Because he wanted to show him a
[1:24:39] greater experience.
[1:24:43] Hallelujah. Now you take that same
[1:24:46] Peter, Jesus died and everything gone.
[1:24:48] Now we go to Pentecost.
[1:24:51] They didn't been gathered cuz the women
[1:24:53] didn't saw Jesus. They went to the tomb.
[1:24:55] They didn't saw him. Hallelujah.
[1:24:57] Resurrected. Now Jesus tell them, "Go
[1:24:58] and wait. Hallelujah. Till you be endued
[1:25:00] with power." I thought they had power
[1:25:02] already.
[1:25:04] They were healing the sick and raising
[1:25:06] the dead, doing all these things and
[1:25:07] feeding 5,000, all that. But Jesus said,
[1:25:10] "No, go wait till you get some power."
[1:25:13] What kind of power? What kind of power
[1:25:15] you talking about? A life. Amen.
[1:25:22] That word, listen. He says, "When you're
[1:25:24] converted, dear, strengthen your
[1:25:26] brother." That word converted,
[1:25:29] it means to love.
[1:25:32] Oh my. To the love and obedience of God.
[1:25:37] That's what it means to be converted.
[1:25:40] When you're really converted is to the
[1:25:43] love and obedience of God. That mean
[1:25:46] there is no more fear.
[1:25:49] Amen.
[1:25:51] And now Peter, hallelujah. Day of
[1:25:53] Pentecost come, power of God comes down,
[1:25:55] the Holy Ghost falls on everybody. Who
[1:25:58] the first one stand up to testify?
[1:26:02] The same one who just denied him.
[1:26:07] It was another level.
[1:26:10] I hope we all striving for that next
[1:26:12] level. Amen.
[1:26:13] There's a level of God where there is no
[1:26:15] fear.
[1:26:16] And now Peter comes out. And you know, I
[1:26:19] want you to catch this. Now he comes
[1:26:21] out. The people say they drunk. And you
[1:26:24] know, it's certain time of day. Those
[1:26:26] were the same people who were accusing
[1:26:27] him of walking with Jesus.
[1:26:29] And by and the prophet of God say they
[1:26:31] were in the upper room afraid.
[1:26:33] And then God, hallelujah, comes through
[1:26:36] with the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:38] fills them. Amen. And now those same
[1:26:40] people who were once afraid, hallelujah,
[1:26:43] turn into spokespeople,
[1:26:45] turns into witness, hallelujah. And
[1:26:47] Peter, the one who just denied, steps
[1:26:50] out and say, "Hey, we ain't drunk."
[1:26:52] Ain't nobody drunk as you supposed. But
[1:26:55] I'm drunk in the Holy Ghost. And better
[1:26:57] yet, this is that that the prophet Joel
[1:27:00] talked about.
[1:27:02] Fear is gone.
[1:27:04] What happened? The life came inside of
[1:27:06] them.
[1:27:10] That's why it's so important to get the
[1:27:13] Holy Ghost
[1:27:15] because the Holy Ghost will take away
[1:27:16] your fears.
[1:27:18] Hallelujah. I'm going to read you a
[1:27:20] quote. This is what the prophet God say.
[1:27:21] He says, "This loving him." He said,
[1:27:23] "Oh, we say we have faith. We have love,
[1:27:27] but if we have love, we'd have faith.
[1:27:30] For that perfect love cast out all
[1:27:33] fear."
[1:27:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:27:36] Uh oh, bro. D going to say something
[1:27:37] now.
[1:27:38] You say, "Well, God, I really want to be
[1:27:39] obedient. I really want to do the things
[1:27:42] you want me to do." Could it be you
[1:27:43] really don't love him?
[1:27:48] Could it say perfect love cast out all
[1:27:50] fear? Amen. Lord, I really want to pay
[1:27:52] my tithe, but I got this bill. Do you
[1:27:55] trust him?
[1:27:58] If you love him, you'll do it. Amen.
[1:28:00] But he said, "Perfect love cast out all
[1:28:02] fear." And this is the clincher. This is
[1:28:04] what got me. He said, "And when fear is
[1:28:06] gone, faith is perfect."
[1:28:12] Think about it. If you could just step
[1:28:13] in the water today,
[1:28:15] all your fear is gone.
[1:28:18] You make way for a perfect reality of
[1:28:20] faith.
[1:28:24] What are you saying? You're saying,
[1:28:25] "God, I trust you."
[1:28:26] That's right.
[1:28:29] I used this illustration a long time
[1:28:30] ago. I say I got two I got two girls
[1:28:35] and you know they are eight years apart
[1:28:38] and I use this illustration like my big
[1:28:40] girl is a teenager. My baby girl is a
[1:28:43] baby. She ain't a little baby no more.
[1:28:45] Y'all seen them.
[1:28:47] But if we go to the ocean and be like,
[1:28:50] "Come on y'all. Let's go take a dive.
[1:28:52] Let's go swim." My big girl going to be
[1:28:54] like, "Okay, you you coming there?"
[1:28:57] Like, "Yeah, I'm coming. Long as I'm
[1:28:59] close by, she good."
[1:29:01] She's swimming, you know. But I had to
[1:29:03] give her instruction. I be like, "Jazz,
[1:29:05] don't go out there too far." All right,
[1:29:06] Daddy. I'm good. I got them.
[1:29:09] So, you got to look out, you know. They
[1:29:10] got barriers and different things. All
[1:29:12] right, Dad. I'm good.
[1:29:15] So, as a teenager, you got to look out
[1:29:17] for them. But then again, they think
[1:29:18] they know everything.
[1:29:19] It ain't that they don't trust you, it's
[1:29:21] that they think they know everything.
[1:29:24] So, there are certain levels of trust.
[1:29:25] Not that she don't love me, but there
[1:29:27] are certain levels of trust. See, some
[1:29:29] of y'all, it's not that you don't love
[1:29:30] God. That's just another level of trust.
[1:29:34] And you know, I take my baby girl said,
[1:29:36] "Come on, let's go get in the water."
[1:29:38] She said, "You coming?" I'm like,
[1:29:39] "Yeah." And she said, "Give me your
[1:29:40] hand."
[1:29:43] See, it's a different kind of trust.
[1:29:46] She's like, "I'm going with you, but I
[1:29:47] need your hand."
[1:29:49] Now, big girl, she's already out there.
[1:29:51] Michael Phelp,
[1:29:53] you know, she doing it all. She's just
[1:29:55] out there going, "Daddy, it feel good
[1:29:58] out here. Come on." I said, "You go out
[1:30:00] there too far. Sharks out there."
[1:30:04] A baby girl like, "Daddy, give me your
[1:30:05] hand. Come on. Let go." And then the
[1:30:07] wave start coming. She said, "I don't
[1:30:09] want to go." I said, "Baby, I got you.
[1:30:11] Come on." She said, "Uh, she realized
[1:30:15] there's another level."
[1:30:17] So when she say, "Can I get on your
[1:30:19] shoulders?"
[1:30:24] I don't know about y'all, but I want to
[1:30:26] be on his shoulders.
[1:30:29] I'm tired of feeling stuff I don't need
[1:30:30] to feel.
[1:30:32] Getting hit by stuff I don't need to get
[1:30:33] hit by. Getting in sank waves and trying
[1:30:36] to get out and everything. If you would
[1:30:38] just say, "Lord, I need more than your
[1:30:39] hand.
[1:30:41] I need more than your hand, God. Let me
[1:30:43] get on your shoulders." And you tell
[1:30:46] that my baby girl is on my shoulders.
[1:30:47] The deeper I go, the more protected she
[1:30:50] is because she ain't feeling nothing.
[1:30:52] I'm the one
[1:30:56] spitting all the water back out. And she
[1:30:58] just like, "Go deeper, daddy. Let's go.
[1:31:00] Let's go out here further."
[1:31:04] That's what God wants you to experience.
[1:31:06] God wants you to go deeper because he's
[1:31:08] the one that's taking you there.
[1:31:15] And as soon as it come up to her knees,
[1:31:16] if it come up to her knees, it's right
[1:31:18] here on me.
[1:31:20] So I'm way out there.
[1:31:24] She ain't even think about me no more.
[1:31:26] She's having a good time with.
[1:31:30] But I told her, "Come on." I told her,
[1:31:32] "Come on. There something I want you to
[1:31:34] experience."
[1:31:36] Church, if it's something you need to
[1:31:38] experience, God got you.
[1:31:42] Amen. And you know what she did, Travis?
[1:31:44] Travis, you know what she did after she
[1:31:46] got wet up? She like, "That's enough.
[1:31:48] Let's go back.
[1:31:51] I got salt all salt everywhere."
[1:31:56] And she go back like she didn't d
[1:32:06] But all her pressure was where on
[1:32:10] church, the battle ain't yours. It's
[1:32:11] God's. Imagine
[1:32:14] God fearing the ocean that he created.
[1:32:18] Imagine God, hallelujah, of fearing
[1:32:20] anything that the devil can do when he
[1:32:22] created the devil.
[1:32:25] You know, Jazz come back said, "Oh,
[1:32:26] boy." Woo! Boy, that was a good swim
[1:32:28] boy. Oh, but I'm tired. And Ke, Mary,
[1:32:31] please, let's go do it again. Cuz she
[1:32:34] ain't use no strength. All of it was on
[1:32:35] me.
[1:32:37] And you know what? She ain't had no
[1:32:39] fear.
[1:32:40] No fear.
[1:32:42] Did I tell y'all a testimony about
[1:32:44] comrade?
[1:32:46] I didn't
[1:32:48] some friends of mine in Canada a couple
[1:32:51] months ago when I was there about a
[1:32:52] month ago. Their son
[1:32:55] comrade Chris Chris and Tesa they go
[1:32:58] brother Eugene's churcha
[1:33:02] was with some of the sisters they they
[1:33:04] around the pool and playing with the
[1:33:06] kids and having like a little eating and
[1:33:08] everything with the kids. Amen.
[1:33:10] And uh you know how you you know how the
[1:33:12] parents do you put them bubble things
[1:33:14] around the kids? I don't even know what
[1:33:15] they call that.
[1:33:16] Yeah. Put them little flo bubble things
[1:33:18] around their arm so if they get out
[1:33:20] there too deep they can still float.
[1:33:23] But you know boys will be boys.
[1:33:26] So comrade took his off.
[1:33:30] My such great faith.
[1:33:34] Comrade took his off and nobody seen him
[1:33:36] take him off. And the person that was
[1:33:38] watching the kids some kind of way a
[1:33:40] comrade got past her.
[1:33:43] And one sister, they was in the they was
[1:33:45] in the pool fellowshipping, talking and
[1:33:47] you know just just just a mommy day. And
[1:33:50] you know uh one of the sisters felt led
[1:33:53] to get out and she said when she got out
[1:33:55] she saw a red reflection on the side of
[1:33:57] the pool. So she went over there and it
[1:34:01] was comrade
[1:34:03] underwater
[1:34:04] dying.
[1:34:07] So they hurry up and got him and and
[1:34:09] pulled him out. They don't know how long
[1:34:10] he was under that. Pulled him out and
[1:34:13] and I think uh one sister did CPR, you
[1:34:17] know, just enough to get a heartbeat and
[1:34:20] they they sent this to hurry up. The
[1:34:22] ambulance came and got him or whatever,
[1:34:24] you know, and and I'll be honest, when
[1:34:27] they told me this, I was saying I was
[1:34:29] like, "Good God almighty." You ever been
[1:34:30] to Edmonton? Don't even look like they
[1:34:32] got no hospital out there.
[1:34:34] I mean, it's so much land. Everything
[1:34:35] just spread out so far you'd be like
[1:34:38] probably took 20 minutes to get the amm
[1:34:41] there.
[1:34:42] And you know they get him and he they
[1:34:44] take him to the hospital and you know
[1:34:46] the hospital do their thing or whatever
[1:34:47] and they get them revived. But now it's
[1:34:50] things that you got to fight.
[1:34:53] Normally when you stop breathing it
[1:34:55] messes up your brain
[1:34:57] to where you lose your memory or
[1:34:59] different things like that may happen or
[1:35:02] something happened to your lungs because
[1:35:03] you have you didn't take too much water
[1:35:05] in your lungs but when they when Conrad
[1:35:08] woke up
[1:35:10] when Conrad woke up Conrad was like
[1:35:12] what's up where we at
[1:35:15] my mama where my daddy
[1:35:17] so you know people panicking they like
[1:35:19] what's your name you know where you from
[1:35:21] and this and that comrade that
[1:35:26] they actually say you who's your mama
[1:35:28] this and that you know Chris tell you
[1:35:30] them talking to him this and that he was
[1:35:32] basically like
[1:35:34] but y'all stop
[1:35:37] and then they showed me the picture Matt
[1:35:39] when he left from the emergency part
[1:35:40] coming out to the waiting room he
[1:35:47] but the greatest part of the testimony
[1:35:49] is you know after something like that it
[1:35:52] can be Very traumatic.
[1:35:54] That child would want to be around
[1:35:55] water. Probably won't even want to take
[1:35:56] a bath no more, brother Aaron. He he be
[1:35:59] like, I I no water. Uh-uh. I ain't even
[1:36:03] going to drink it no more. Give me pe
[1:36:05] like
[1:36:07] church.
[1:36:09] Soon this comrade got back home,
[1:36:12] he say, "Let's get back in the pool."
[1:36:19] Dr. God say we need faith like a child.
[1:36:24] Hallelujah.
[1:36:25] Church, he didn't have any fear. Nothing
[1:36:28] was wrong with his mind. Nothing was
[1:36:30] wrong with his blows. Hallelujah. So I
[1:36:33] told Tahesa, he asked, he asked Tesa, he
[1:36:35] said, she said, "Honey, do you realize
[1:36:36] what was happening? What was you
[1:36:37] thinking?" He said, "Yeah, I was
[1:36:38] underwater." He She said, "What was you
[1:36:40] thinking?" He said, "I was thinking,
[1:36:42] mama, why ain't you saving me?"
[1:36:46] And you know what kind of lima that did
[1:36:48] on her?
[1:36:48] Oh yeah. Now she's going to beat herself
[1:36:51] up.
[1:36:52] So I told Taesa, I said, "Taisa,
[1:36:54] sometimes things happen just for a
[1:36:56] testimony."
[1:36:59] Look, ain't nothing wrong with him.
[1:37:01] Ain't nothing wrong with his physical
[1:37:03] being. Ain't nothing wrong with his
[1:37:04] mind. Nothing. So God allowed this so
[1:37:07] that y'all could have a testimony
[1:37:09] of the supernatural. And what I love
[1:37:11] about God, Amen. Even when your back
[1:37:14] turned, God got everything under
[1:37:16] control. Even when you don't know what's
[1:37:18] about to happen, God got angels,
[1:37:20] hallelujah, taking care of everything.
[1:37:22] We don't have to fear.
[1:37:25] When fear is gone, we can walk in the
[1:37:28] supernatural,
[1:37:30] church. Because there was no fear, a
[1:37:33] viper jumped on Paul's hand. What did
[1:37:35] Paul do? Shake it off.
[1:37:37] Somebody need to shake it off today.
[1:37:40] Hallelujah.
[1:37:41] What did Jacob's fear do? It led him to
[1:37:44] wrestle with an angel.
[1:37:46] Hallelujah.
[1:37:48] And when David had no fear, he killed a
[1:37:51] bear. He killed a lion. Then he killed
[1:37:53] Goliath.
[1:37:57] That's the levels we want, church.
[1:38:00] A level where there is no fear.
[1:38:02] What is it? It's a Holy Ghost experience
[1:38:06] where God lives in you, changes your
[1:38:08] nature, changes your thoughts, changes
[1:38:11] your cravings. Amen.
[1:38:14] That's what Pentecost is all about.
[1:38:16] Pentecost made Peter what? An overcomer.
[1:38:20] Because now he goes to those same people
[1:38:22] he ran from that he cussed out and say,
[1:38:24] "This is that
[1:38:27] and I'm willing to die for it."
[1:38:29] Hallelujah.
[1:38:31] That's what happens when you get the
[1:38:32] Holy Ghost.
[1:38:34] You ain't afraid to tell your friends at
[1:38:35] school, I'm a Christian.
[1:38:39] And if I can be honest, my friends in
[1:38:41] school respected me more for being a
[1:38:44] Christian.
[1:38:46] Your real friends will.
[1:38:48] Amen. I had some buddies who used to go
[1:38:50] drink.
[1:38:52] You know, we was mischievous teenagers.
[1:38:55] They're like, "Hey, let's go. We going
[1:38:56] to go drink. We going to go get they got
[1:38:58] a beer."
[1:39:01] And they like, "Come on. We going to go
[1:39:02] get the beer. We go drink it and this
[1:39:04] this and that. This and that." And I'm
[1:39:05] like, "No, you can't go.
[1:39:12] I like, well, I'd rather be mysterious
[1:39:14] and let you get in there. No, you can't
[1:39:15] go.
[1:39:16] You different.
[1:39:20] Set me down.
[1:39:23] And I hope some of y'all friends do you
[1:39:25] like that. They see you different.
[1:39:27] Hallelujah. And they respect the life of
[1:39:29] Christ in you.
[1:39:31] Give them what you call real friends.
[1:39:35] Not these ones who try to make you go
[1:39:37] ahead. Why don't you just go ahead and
[1:39:38] hit it a little bit? Go ahead and take a
[1:39:40] puffer. Hey, by the way, it's legal.
[1:39:43] No, no, no. Them ain't real friends.
[1:39:45] They don't respect your life. They don't
[1:39:47] respect you trying to live good. Just
[1:39:49] get rid of that person.
[1:39:51] Hallelujah. But a real friend would
[1:39:53] expect Hallelujah. the life you trying
[1:39:55] to live.
[1:39:57] Hallelujah.
[1:39:58] But church, if we could just get to that
[1:40:00] greater level. What's the greater level,
[1:40:02] Brother Diggs? The restoration of the
[1:40:04] life of Christ inside the believer.
[1:40:08] Holy Ghost filled, walking, talking,
[1:40:11] fire brand believer.
[1:40:16] That's what our church wants. That's
[1:40:18] what our church needs. That's what our
[1:40:20] church will exist by.
[1:40:23] Hallelujah.
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:26] And if I can't, knowing who brother
[1:40:27] Brandham Dog is, praise God, but that
[1:40:30] ain't it.
[1:40:31] Hallelujah. Knowing this horse name,
[1:40:33] praise God, that ain't it.
[1:40:35] Hallelujah. need that fire brimstone
[1:40:38] walk with God.
[1:40:40] Amen. When something comes in and
[1:40:42] changes your nature and you look back at
[1:40:45] what you used to do and you don't desire
[1:40:47] to do it no more.
[1:40:50] Some of us in here, we used to drink.
[1:40:52] Some of us used to smoke and we can
[1:40:54] still go out right now and do it. The
[1:40:56] thing is we don't want to.
[1:40:59] Come on now. I know I got more believers
[1:41:01] than that in here. We don't want to. You
[1:41:04] can put a pack of cigarettes in my face.
[1:41:05] because it may get that junk out my
[1:41:07] face. Why? Cuz I've been changed. I'm on
[1:41:10] another level. Hallelujah. You can say,
[1:41:11] "Hey, we serving some alcohol at the at
[1:41:14] the cookout." I can say, "I don't want
[1:41:16] none. Give me a Coca-Cola."
[1:41:18] Yeah, I said it. Coca-Cola.
[1:41:23] Come on, musicians.
[1:41:25] Hallelujah,
[1:41:26] church. But the greatest thing about it,
[1:41:29] some of us have reached that level. Come
[1:41:32] on.
[1:41:34] We've reached the level where Christ is
[1:41:36] living in us.
[1:41:38] He's changed our person. He's changed
[1:41:40] our thoughts, our mannerism, and all
[1:41:42] these things. Hallelujah. And now we're
[1:41:45] here for the benefits of his use.
[1:41:48] Hallelujah.
[1:41:50] That's what we want. Amen.
[1:41:52] We don't want just a mediocre life where
[1:41:53] we can be witnesses of good things. Cuz
[1:41:56] that's who Peter was without the Holy
[1:41:58] Ghost. He was just a witness of all the
[1:42:00] great things God had did.
[1:42:02] But when the Holy Ghost came now, he was
[1:42:03] in service. He was a part of all of it.
[1:42:07] Hallelujah. Think about it. Peter could
[1:42:09] come back and say with the Holy Ghost,
[1:42:11] when you see me, you see the father.
[1:42:15] Remember in Acts 4, the Bible said they
[1:42:18] saw the things they were doing and they
[1:42:20] took knowledge of them that they had
[1:42:22] been with who? Jesus.
[1:42:24] They saw the same level of life. Even on
[1:42:27] John the Baptist, John would look so

[1:52:03] brother.
[1:52:04] Yes, sir.
[1:52:05] I'm going to turn up my praise.
[1:52:06] Hallelujah.
[1:52:07] I'm going to say, I'm going to turn up
[1:52:09] my praise.
[1:52:10] I'm going to drown out my doubts. Amen.
[1:52:13] Can you sing that, Brother Ken?
[1:52:15] The key of G.
[1:52:16] Got the turn up my praise for that.
[1:52:20] They got the words for that.
[1:52:21] Yeah, you got the words, brother Caleb.
[1:52:23] Turn up my praise. Is that what it's
[1:52:25] called, brother Ken?
[1:52:26] It's called turn up my praise.
[1:52:28] Turn up my praise.
[1:52:28] Yes. If we got that. Did you appreciate
[1:52:31] the word of God this morning? Give the
[1:52:32] Lord Jesus a hand clap of praise.
[1:52:35] Hallelujah.
[1:52:37] [Applause]
[1:52:42] Got that, brother Caleb.
[1:52:45] Amen.
[1:52:49] Somebody may be helping try to find
[1:52:51] that. It may be. I appreciated the word
[1:52:54] so much and then I believe the Lord
[1:52:56] spoke specifically. I just got thinking
[1:52:59] so much. I think it was um I think it
[1:53:03] was the message why Christ speak and
[1:53:05] brother Brandham's 1963 I think it was
[1:53:08] and he's talking about Moses and how
[1:53:10] that Moses had seen in the word that
[1:53:13] that God's people was going to sojourn.
[1:53:15] They was going to be in Egypt for 400
[1:53:17] years and then God was going to come
[1:53:19] down and deliver them. And brother
[1:53:21] Brandham says Moses knew this
[1:53:23] intellectually. He read the word. He
[1:53:25] seen the word. He said he knew the
[1:53:26] promise of the word. And he said so he
[1:53:28] tried to deliver them knowing the word.
[1:53:31] And he said he tried to deliver them
[1:53:33] based on that intellectual knowledge of
[1:53:35] the promise. And what did he do? He he
[1:53:37] he murdered a man.
[1:53:39] And brother Brandham says, but what
[1:53:41] happened when Moses met the burning
[1:53:43] bush? He met the experience of the word.
[1:53:47] He met the light of the word. And he
[1:53:48] said that changed everything. thing and
[1:53:50] he said and until the believer changes
[1:53:53] from just an intellectual concept or
[1:53:55] experience and he said and it moves to a
[1:53:58] real faith to see the promise of the
[1:54:00] word of God fulfilled and he said
[1:54:02] that'll bring a deliverance to God's
[1:54:04] people. When Moses caught the
[1:54:06] revelation, he wasn't just, as we said
[1:54:08] before, he wasn't just part of the
[1:54:10] revival, but he met the revivor.
[1:54:13] And when you meet the revivor, oh, you
[1:54:16] you're thankful for the revival, but the
[1:54:18] revivor has made himself real to you,
[1:54:20] then everything whatsoever Jesus said,
[1:54:23] whatsoever you ask, you say to this
[1:54:25] mountain, be thou removed, cast into the
[1:54:28] sea. And don't doubt, have faith in your
[1:54:30] heart, and you'll see it. I believe
[1:54:32] we're seeing that. Amen. And you got
[1:54:34] that, brother George. We'll just move on
[1:54:35] to something else. That's all right.
[1:54:36] Give me uh the key of F. I think it is.
[1:54:38] Nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus.
[1:54:41] Is that
[1:54:43] Nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus.
[1:54:50] I stand in all your amazing
[1:54:56] ways.
[1:54:58] I worship you as long as I am breathing.
[1:55:05] God, you are faithful as you. Nobody
[1:55:10] loves me like you.
[1:55:13] Let's sing a verse now. Morning. I see
[1:55:16] you in the sunrise.
[1:55:18] Oh, this morning
[1:55:23] I see you in the sunrise.
[1:55:26] every morning.
[1:55:30] It's like a picture that you painted for
[1:55:36] me.
[1:55:38] A love letter in the sky.
[1:55:44] Oh,
[1:55:48] nobody nobody loves me like you love me,
[1:55:54] Jesus.
[1:55:55] [Music]
[1:55:56] I stand in awe in your amazing
[1:56:01] way.
[1:56:04] I worship you as long as I am free.
[1:56:11] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody.
[1:56:16] Come on, let's worship him now before we
[1:56:18] go. Mountains, you're tearing down. all
[1:56:22] mountains.
[1:56:25] You're breaking down the weight of all
[1:56:28] my mountain.
[1:56:32] And even when it feels like I'm
[1:56:36] surrounded,
[1:56:39] you never you never leave my side.
[1:56:46] Yes, Lord. Oh,
[1:56:49] [Music]
[1:56:51] nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus.
[1:56:58] I stand in all of your amazing
[1:57:03] ways.
[1:57:06] I worship you as long as I am breathing.
[1:57:13] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[1:57:18] loves me like you do. Let's sing that
[1:57:21] second verse now. Mountains, you're
[1:57:24] breaking down.
[1:57:26] Oh my mouth,
[1:57:30] you're breaking down the weight of all
[1:57:34] my mountain.
[1:57:38] Even when it feels like I'm surrounded,
[1:57:44] you never you never leave. Oh, raise
[1:57:48] those hands now. Sing it. Oh,
[1:57:54] [Music]
[1:57:56] nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus.
[1:58:03] I send you all and you're in my face
[1:58:08] away.
[1:58:11] I worship you as long as I am breathing.
[1:58:18] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[1:58:23] loves nobody likes me and nobody loves
[1:58:27] me like you love me, Jesus.
[1:58:33] I stand
[1:58:35] your amazing
[1:58:37] way.
[1:58:40] [Music]
[1:58:45] Yes, Lord
[1:58:47] God, you are faithful and true. No, I
[1:58:52] love me like you. You do,
[1:58:57] Lord. We lift up our hands,
[1:58:59] Lord. And we just give you thanks, Lord.
[1:59:01] Thank you for your word. Thank you for
[1:59:03] Brother Diggs, Lord, who came and Lord,
[1:59:06] poured himself, let you, Lord, speak
[1:59:08] through him and poured himself out. We
[1:59:10] thank you, Lord, for this word that was
[1:59:12] spoken. We believe, Lord, it's a word
[1:59:14] spoken in due season, in due time, Lord.
[1:59:18] And we believe, Lord, that when we
[1:59:19] speak, when we use our voice and we
[1:59:21] declare, Lord, something takes place in
[1:59:24] the supernatural realm. and Satan is
[1:59:27] defeated and lies are dispelled. Lord,
[1:59:30] so we speak it this morning with our
[1:59:31] voices and we say amen, Lord. We say
[1:59:34] yes, Lord. We accept it this morning.
[1:59:37] Let every individual, Lord, who heard
[1:59:39] that freedom call, Lord, that there's
[1:59:42] another level. What is that other level,
[1:59:44] Lord? Father, it's the message that you
[1:59:46] gave to Nicodemus. A man must be born
[1:59:50] again.
[1:59:51] He can never see the kingdom of God
[1:59:53] unless he's born again, Lord. So we pray
[1:59:57] for every individual, young and old
[2:00:00] alike, Lord, that would be like Peter,
[2:00:02] Father, with that intellectual
[2:00:04] experience. It's good, Lord. It's a good
[2:00:06] promise. Even your prophet spoke of
[2:00:08] Moses, Lord, and he said, even the seed
[2:00:11] of God, even his seed, your seed was
[2:00:14] laying inside of Moses's heart, but it
[2:00:18] hadn't been quickened to life yet, Lord.
[2:00:20] and he tried to fulfill the word and and
[2:00:22] caused caused death Lord and Father but
[2:00:26] you your prophet said when he met that
[2:00:28] burning bush when he met that light Lord
[2:00:31] and I can even Lord think of even right
[2:00:34] now Jesus the miracles that we could
[2:00:36] testify of even sister Brenda's Lord
[2:00:38] that we rejoiced over Lord the recently
[2:00:41] Lord the man that you healed of cancer
[2:00:43] father your prophet said those miracles
[2:00:45] come that ought to give you a rapture in
[2:00:47] faith that ought to give you faith to
[2:00:49] believe for anything in the
[2:00:51] supernatural, Lord. So give us that
[2:00:53] supernatural faith to accept it. To ask,
[2:00:56] Lord, not just ask for it, but to accept
[2:00:58] it. Whatsoever we ask, whatsoever our
[2:01:01] need is, whatever your need is, Lord,
[2:01:03] whatever our need is in our family and
[2:01:05] our children and our home and Lord,
[2:01:07] whatever level it is, we just raise our
[2:01:09] hands and say, Lord, we're not only
[2:01:11] asking for it, but we have supernatural
[2:01:14] faith to reach out and take a hold of
[2:01:16] it, accept it, Lord. May you do it this
[2:01:19] morning, Lord Jesus. I pray give us that
[2:01:21] greater experience. Lord, we ask take us
[2:01:24] from this place, Lord. All the
[2:01:26] ministering brothers, Lord, my dad, the
[2:01:28] our pastor, Father, those that are
[2:01:29] traveling home, Lord, those that are
[2:01:32] still recovering, Lord Jesus, I pray,
[2:01:34] Brother Tony, Lord, he's here this
[2:01:36] morning. May you continue to give him
[2:01:38] strength, Lord, and quicken his body.
[2:01:40] Bring healing to all of those, Lord. But
[2:01:42] don't name them this morning that are
[2:01:44] sick and body. I pray God that you would
[2:01:46] bind that spirit father and may healing
[2:01:49] Lord virtue flow to our families and our
[2:01:52] church Lord we ask bless us now Lord one
[2:01:54] and all as we dismiss from you from this
[2:01:56] place but not from this presence Lord
[2:01:59] may we take it with us Lord help us to
[2:02:01] fight the battle may we be encouraged
[2:02:03] this morning Lord we ask it in Jesus
[2:02:05] Christ's name amen we're going to let
[2:02:08] you go and be dismissed going to let
[2:02:09] brother Ken sing as your as you're
[2:02:12] dismissed at your own leisure If the
[2:02:14] Lord of all the earth,
[2:02:18] would care to know my name
[2:02:23] care to feel my hurt?
[2:02:29] Who am I
[2:02:31] that the bright and morning star
[2:02:36] would choose to light the way
[2:02:40] for my ever wondering heart.
[2:02:46] Not because of who I am,
[2:02:50] but because of what you've done.
[2:02:55] Not because of what I've done.
[2:02:59] But because of who you are,
[2:03:04] I am a flower quickly fading.
[2:03:10] Here today and gone tomorrow.
[2:03:14] A wave tossed in the ocean.
[2:03:18] A vapor in the wind. Still you hear me
[2:03:24] when I'm calling.
[2:03:26] Lord, you catch me when I'm falling.
[2:03:31] And you told me who I am.
[2:03:36] I am yours.
[2:03:45] Who am I
[2:03:47] that the eyes that see my sin
[2:03:52] would look on me with love
[2:03:56] and watch me rise again?
[2:04:00] [Music]
[2:04:02] Who am I?
[2:04:04] That the voice that calm the sea
[2:04:09] would call out through the rain
[2:04:13] and calm the storm in me.
[2:04:19] Not because of who I am,
[2:04:23] but because of what you've done.
[2:04:27] Not because of what I've done,
[2:04:31] but because of who you are.
[2:04:38] A flower quickly fade.
[2:04:42] Here today and gone tomorrow.
[2:04:46] A wave tossed in the ocean.
[2:04:50] A vapor in the wind. Still you hear me
[2:04:55] when I'm calling.
