[42:50] club or or whatever it
[42:52] is what kind of gift you want I could
[42:55] ask for for a greater
[42:57] gift God gave us the greatest gift of
[43:00] all when he gave
[43:02] himself God who stepped down from Glory
[43:05] went to the Cross brother BR said in
[43:08] God's WRA gift I love this quote I send
[43:11] this to people every year they're
[43:13] probably tired of saying it but I love
[43:14] it just a little while from then and the
[43:17] world was going to receive its greatest
[43:20] gift that it ever received a little
[43:23] package wrapped up a little first little
[43:27] Christmas package that was ever wrapped
[43:29] in all the world God wrapped it up I
[43:34] want to break in on my thought and say
[43:36] this the greatest thing was ever wrapped
[43:39] in human flesh was wrapped in it God
[43:43] himself wrapped his own self Hallelujah
[43:47] in a Christmas package and sent it to
[43:49] the
[43:50] world why did they refuse it why could
[43:54] they see it why did they turn it down
[43:56] down why is it they didn't want it the
[43:58] same reason they don't want it tonight
[44:01] it wasn't pretty
[44:03] enough it was Jesus in a manger wrapped
[44:06] up in a dirty old swaddling
[44:08] cloth that was his present wrapped in
[44:11] swaddling would you open up a gift that
[44:13] somebody wrapped up in swaddling
[44:17] cloth we'll move
[44:20] on the same reason they don't want
[44:23] tonight it wasn't handed to them cuss
[44:24] they were used to gift being handed
[44:26] that's the reason it's rejected tonight
[44:29] is because it's not handed to the people
[44:31] with the custom that they've been used
[44:33] to re receiving gifts but God wraps his
[44:36] own
[44:38] package he's got a right to it he's the
[44:42] one that's given it he has a right to
[44:44] wrap it in any way he wants to wrap it
[44:46] and doesn't make any
[44:49] difference how it is he's got a right to
[44:52] do it because he's the one that's given
[44:54] the gift if I'm going to give you a gift
[44:57] don't make fun of how it's wrapped it's
[45:00] my gift I'm give you I wrap it the way I

[45:08] attractive to the

[1:01:30] preacher up here preaching and you heard
[1:01:32] Jesus spoke the right way something down
[1:01:35] on the inside of you came to life at
[1:01:37] that name of Jesus the most powerful
[1:01:39] name in the
[1:01:45] world the angel continued telling her he
[1:01:47] said he shall be great he shall be
[1:01:49] called the son of the highest the Lord
[1:01:52] God shall give unto him the throne of
[1:01:54] his father David and he shall reign over
[1:01:57] the house of Jacob forever and his
[1:02:00] kingdom there shall be no end and then
[1:02:03] said Mary unto the angel how shall this
[1:02:06] be seeing I know not a
[1:02:09] man she was questioning the angel if you
[1:02:13] look at a few scriptures above there the
[1:02:14] same Angel was at Zach Zacharias in the
[1:02:17] temple well he told Zacharias says

[1:02:37] them they had a baby he was 100 and she
[1:02:40] was 90 so 75 was
[1:02:43] nothing but instead him questioning the
[1:02:46] angel what happened you'll be dumb until
[1:02:49] the baby's
[1:02:51] born so why didn't he strike Mary
[1:02:58] I don't know but nothing happened to her
[1:03:02] she was highly
[1:03:04] favored she was just like how's this
[1:03:06] even possible and she had it right I
[1:03:09] don't even know a
[1:03:11] man and the angel answered and said to
[1:03:13] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[1:03:17] and the power of the highest shall
[1:03:19] overshadow thee therefore and that Holy
[1:03:22] thing which shall be born of Thee shall
[1:03:24] be called The Son of
[1:03:28] God the Holy Ghost will form that in you

[1:04:24] move we know that when God said let
[1:04:27] there be light and Adam
