couldn't get out of working tonight amen give him another hand amen praise the Lorden God bless you we greet you in the name of the Lord happy to have you all in the house of God tonight so uh thank you probably already have my title I sent it out today we're going to invite you to Galatians the fth chapter Galatians chapter 5 and we're going to catch verses 16 through 25 okay trying to figure out who that was am man I knew she was pretty but it might had to be Zoe all right honey you can keep up tonight right okay amen sometimes Papa goes fast all right praise the Lord you love the Lord amen praise God I'm happy to be here tonight I um I've thought about this thought um for the last several days and it just seemed like right away this morning it just like exploded on me so amen we'll get as far as we can amen will that be all right Galatians chapter 5 we're taking a title tonight opposing the Judgment of Heaven opposing the Judgment from he of Heaven opposing the Judgment of Heaven Galatians 5 and we begin at verse 16 we'll run down through verse 25 this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh man I'll take that deal amen that's the desire of every Christian my goodness it's really it's really that easy according to the Apostle walk in the spirit ah there must be a tremendous amount of power in that walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh Lord grant it to us all for the flesh so here's what happen happens when you don't walk in the spirit for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other and I love the Simplicity of this so that you can not do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit ye are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath Strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness reings and such like sound like the world sounds a whole lot like Leo DEA if you ask me of which I tell you before as I have told also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God I wonder what in the world thinks about that when their when their celebrities die of a overdose or just too much fast living and then they have a big rally and everybody's looking up like they must be looking down and uh they're surely in heaven looking down but I wonder how they imagine that that celebrity who's got every one of these these on a regular basis and suddenly they're somehow in heaven so all right so he says verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit so now if he's telling you that you have to do both then it's obvious you might only do one so you say well how could I live in the spirit and not walk in the spirit well you might be born again of the spirit of God you might be a real for real Christian a for real believer but you're don't you don't design your life to walk effectively under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and when you do that old flesh is still there amen let's pray father we thank you for your love to us thank you for your word tonight now Lord I'm just depending on you to help me step aside so that you can be the preacher to these people like you have been to me throughout this day Lord I commit myself into your hands for service this is all about you after all Lord this is your plan it's your word it's your kingdom it's your people it's your your whole Vision it's everything Lord For Your Glory father we as Mortals we've been given life well it seems to me that if we've been given Life by a lifegiver we ought to owe him our Allegiance father I pray you'll help us in this tonight instruct us teach us on this Wednesday night service we commit ourselves into your hands in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated I thought that when I began working putting all of this together like I say I had the thought previous but it really began to gel um today last night this morning early in today in my mind and I thought to myself I'm going to come step and the je youth that I really want you to pay extra Keen attention tonight because I'm really wanting to deliver my heart to our young men and young women however studying it I realized that it really is for us all is that all right so maybe you're young at heart he amen even if you're not actually young like brother Luther myself Amen brother Charles amen but you're young at heart amen so I I'm I'm getting younger did you know that oh I promise you I'm getting younger sister Jean's actually getting younger not older amen praise the Lord that's good news for us you know I I thought about this as a as a as a kind of a subtopic tonight and I and the subtopic if I were to choose one I would have I would have chosen true godliness versus superficial imitation and it really begs the question how can you really tell the difference between true godliness and a superficial imitation because imitation can look like the true I mean counterfeits fo a lot of people counterfeits can fool the government counterfeits can even fool Machinery if it's done correctly and so there is uh an imitation or what brother brandham the word brother brandham chose was an impersonation of Christianity so now that's not my my my whole theme tonight it's just a subtopic that I want to launch on when we're taking this T topic upon opposing the Judgment of heaven so I thought about what could be some some things some good things some worthy things some notable things to look for in comparison when we're trying to far it out what is true godliness from the impersonation which can look an awful lot like it and so I thought about you know brother bam talks a lot about motives and objectives now it's of course it's possible and I can I I'm not preaching on it tonight but I could give you several examples how you actually can be very sincere and be sincerely wrong you can absolutely have a very good motive and a very good objective you know your your objective is where it is you're trying to get to and your motive is why are you doing it why are you going from here to there what's your purpose and you can have a tremendous motive a tremendous objective but yet be outside of the line and the Order of God's word let me just give you an example for clarity's sake it is it is outside it is a wonderful thing if a wife and a mother wants to be spiritual and wants to be a prayer Warrior and wants to really shake heaven with prayer that is value Priceless however that can be her absolute pure motive and her absolute objetive Ive but if she's deciding to stay up all night so that the next day she can't fix food for her children see to the needs of her husband then she's got a great motive and a great objective but she's outside of the line in order of how God wants her to carry it out make sense a number of examples I could give you that's one of my oldie Goldies that I come back to again and again I could give you examples of men it's wonderful brothers if you want to give to missions and give to the poor and spread the gospel around the world but don't don't give them um you know Dominion Energy's power bill money that belongs to Dominion Energy you promised them that you would pay the bill when it came in see so so we realize we can have all kinds of wonderful things that we want to do but we also have to be decent people law-abiding citizens and we have to we have to function in uh within the guidelines of God's word man i' unlocked y'all down goodness gracious I'm going to tell some jokes amen get everybody moving again I don't even know how I got on that it's not in my notes so don't hurl something at me but but motives are good you know is the person's godliness motivated by a sincere desire to honor God that's a good metric you can look at when you're trying to differentiate between true godliness and uh and the impersonation of Christianity what's the real motive is it really a desire to honor God and serve God and serve others mind you you know or or because you say Well when is it not that oh my goodness friends it the world is filled with people who want to be charlatans who want to be preachers just for money and popularity there's people who want to who they always want recognition they they want status they want personal gain and uh you know so so a lot of times you can see what appears to be true godliness but when you look at the motive behind it you go man see I don't think God can get behind that we talk often about fruits of the spirit we read them in Paul's fifth chapter of Galatians so does the person's life bear the true fruit of the spirit that we read such things as love and joy and peace and patience and kindness and godliness and faithfulness and gentleness and here's a big one especially in leoda self-control the reason that's such a big one in Le is because there's so many things built to control you so that you don't self-control and if you're really a Christian with the spirit of God in you you want to be able to take the Holy Spirit and control this flesh as Paul said I bring it under subjection because I promise you it won't stay there if you don't bring it under subjection see this is why we bring every thought subject to the Holy Spirit brother brandom you know we we talk about you know some sometimes people you know when that when you start to look at the fruits of their Spirit you don't see a lot of patience and faithfulness and and self-control sometimes you see negative traits like like instead of selflessness you see selfishness you see pride you see criticism brother brandham said this and show us the father and it'll satisfy Amen to that the Bible said now this is amazing watch this now it's what the prophet taught us the Bible says and he goes back you're you're Gods amateur Gods see you're Gods because here's why not that you elected yourself to be or won a election or decide to be or went out and did some great deed you are God's because you're part of God you're Sons and Daughters of God yes you are see I love how he throws that in there in case you kind of went I don't know about me yes you are see you're a part of him and you become a Creator isn't that beautiful now how many want to put it to use all right here you go here's your best way to put it to use he says let me give you a little little speck now what you're going to put to use that you have creation power brother R said you got enough power in you to create a whole world and go live on it that's the lot so brother random says let me give you a little speck of light just in a minute just a minute now now he just told you you're you're you're god you're an amateur God because you're part of him you become a Creator you are a Creator yourself did did you ever see people that was nice people though you just couldn't be around them hardly something about them you just couldn't stand now brother Brandon is a Christian but he's acknowledging there's some people you don't want to be around they're nice people but you don't want to be around them did you ever see and then he watch him flip it did you ever see people that you just love to be around did you ever see them kind of people that's the atmosphere that they create themselves amen amen you're creators yeah that's an atmosphere that you create your so I'll ask you today what are you creating what you been creating lately what' you create today when somebody cut you off in traffic lock everybody down again brother Ben what' you create today when somebody didn't look at you the right way or speak to you the right way what did you what did you turn on your creation machine and do remember they don't have creation machine only you do you're Sons and Daughters of God I believe that if you're a Christian there ought to be consistency if if you're not an impersonation of Christianity if you're genuinely Godly then there then that speaks to me of consistency if the person's godliness is consistent across all the areas of their life because sometimes friends we can act one way in public and another way in private and we might as well admit it you know so you know so um you know then then there there's humility I don't to get bogged down right here when I'm trying to get out of the gate there's humility I think humility is a good a good metric to a good barometer of whether somebody's truly Godly or whether this is a uh uh what brother brandham called it impersonation we called it a superficial limitation same thing uh so there's humility you know does the person acknowledge their own sinfulness and their need for Grace see or do they sadly boy have I seen this all too quickly forget what the Lord so graciously save them from come on come on you see so I I'm afraid you know brother Ernie vill used to say the army of God is the only army in the world that ever kills its own wounded is it you know friends sometimes we have to ask ourselves if we're not impersonating Christianity and we really are True Believers then I just think that godliness real true godliness wouldn't send me on fault finding missions now not fact finding missions because uh but fault finding missions when you're on a looking for faults facts don't mean much to you see and so now now you could say well well but but but they're sinning and and they're too carnal well okay maybe so maybe so but you know I thought about today I thought I remembered St Paul you remember over in Romans 2 when they the church had those Believers coming in they' just been you know just barbaric that brother brandom said we were you know with a club on our back the Jews were you know they were used to serving God and you get all these these heathens that come into the church and man the Jews just wanted to slice and dice them and Paul goes back there and and I and and I went and I looked at my uh my J my jwv version on Romans 2:4 I wondered I couldn't remember what how I'd said that but I remembered it was in Romans 2 and here's how it translated don't you realize is what Paul was saying to them don't you realize how kind tolerant and patient God is with you or don't you care can't you see how kind he has been in giving you time to turn from your sin see so you know he had to remind impatient Believers about their short-term memories of their own past failures we don't want none of that come on friends we're all in this together it's all for one and one for all see so you know when we when we think of it in that regard I think that we are to I mean listen can I can I say it like this that God's family has plenty of of God's preacher core pounding on them without them needing you to pound on them can I remind you of that they get pounded on Plenty by God's preacher core they don't need you pounding on them turn around your neighbor and say God bless you amen now not b not bless your heart don't don't say bless your heart cuz that don't mean nothing that's a southern thing brother Ben but God bless you brother brandom said it's the nicest thing you could ever say don't it feel good it feels good to say it it feels good to hear somebody say it amen so you know what God has approved um I think that God has been very faithful to always have his word represented in the earth uh I think you can rely on him God is very reliable brother brandham said God take you know takes his man but never his Spirit Satan does the same thing takes his Spirit takes his man but never his Spirit but God you know he's trustworthy he is consistent and you can rely on him to always have his word represented in the earth now you know because I mean when you think about it at the great white Throne judgment you know what's going to be his measuring standard well Paul said it's the gospel I preach yes well then that's the word of God then who is it that eats the book the word of God but the bride and she's now become the Living Word brother brandham said when the book is closed for the last time the word will be flesh so he's going to have the word sitting on the throne who were Overcomers who believed the word fed on the word became the word so the the there be nobody that's why I've said over and over and over again you go to Matthew 25 go to the Book of Revelation you don't find people who are condemned at that judgment bar crying foul right am nobody's holding signs nobody's marching see so so that being the case friends that God is very trustworthy and consistent to always have his word represented correctly somewhere in the earth then one would have thought that you know whatever God approved man would instantly accept I mean that seems logical to to me surely whatever the Creator approved of wouldn't man immediately go okay see I mean that that as as Joseph Parker from the late 1800 said he would be ashamed to put his opinion in opposition to the Judgment of Heaven see I mean is that a reasonable assumption I think it is that whatever received God's approval would be immediately embraced by man that's what I think is that what you think that's what makes sense to me see um but is it what we see is there anything friends think with me now it's just a Wednesday night I'm just I'm just just just going along trying to deliver my heart to you is there anything in today's socially politically correct um what they call Norms they're normal would there be anything in these socially correct Norms where Humanity seems embarrassed to contradict Heaven's judgment with their own their own opinion do you see anybody embarrassed to do that the approval of God should command instant acceptance from mankind he ought to feel ashamed to oppose his opinion to the Judgment of Heaven is it just me or do people seem to be running a million miles an hour away from that and it's getting worse with every age in every passing day I think so is it prophetic I believe it is I believe that's part of what Paul was talking about in the perilous times that would come at the end time men would be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God didn't say they didn't love God just said they love pleasure more than they loved God in second Timothy um D give it to me honey 2 Timothy 3:5 I wasn't going to read it but I think I will here Paul discusses an end time what I'm going to call a human anomaly in which people will actually display a form of godliness but it will will not be authentic and that's a prophecy 2 Timothy 3:5 if you can't oh there we go having a form of godliness but denying the power and brother brandham takes off on that denying the power he connects it to Faith In other words where God is more to you than just a a book of rules and and regs it's just you know the Bible's more than a spec book to you the the it the Bible is something alive to you the word of God is a living thing to you you care about the word see and so Paul thank you honey Paul discusses Paul discusses this end time human anomaly where there's a form of godliness but it's not actually authentic so how then do we differentiate uh a close approximation of godliness how how do you differentiate that close approximation from the real thing a mere form of God liness that's not exactly the general the the the the the genuine article there seems to me to be only one reliable measuring standard and this is where when brother Brenham took it to here it make it makes such sense to me as a student of the Bible as a preacher of the Gospel that the only real measuring standard is is do you have an amen to every word do do you have a full acceptance of the word for your day for the day in which you live because I mean come on friends all of those what what what was the list we had um motivation fruits consistency humility I mean all of those displays all of those gifts all of those attributes can be impersonated let's just be real they can be impersonated see uh I mean it it it can all be impersonated and I mean if you look you know in the Bible that we see although it it it's came through a through through through 2,000 years you know uh fractured and deluded through 2,000 years of theological confusion the scripture promises us that the original gospel truth will be Faithfully restored at the end time to do what to prepare a bride to prepare her to do what to receive the dead in Christ at the resurrection to meet the Lord in the air how many would like to do that see do we have room in our busy schedule for the Rapture you know I mean there's a lot of things of you know that that that help us get to the Rapture that we don't seem to prioritize too much amen amen so you know I I don't think a busy schedule should keep you from being spiritual I think you ought to do whatever you got to do to make sure you're spiritual because if you walk in the spirit and live by the spirit you won't follow and into the weaknesses of the Flesh and that's a pretty good deal you're actually getting prepared and it's a it's a it's interesting to me people sometimes the priorities they set amen I'm actually not here to preach a critical sermon tonight I'm trying to to encourage us but we got to look at the real world we got to we I mean if you can't say Amen say Oh Me Oh My you know it's not my brother or my sister I promise you it's not the people in front of you beside you or behind you going to keep you out of a Rapture it's you if anybody keeps you out it'll be you if anybody hinders your faith it's going to be you if anybody causes your your prayers to not go higher than the ceiling it ain't me it ain't your brother or your sister it's you we have seen the enemy and it is US amen see amen Jesus said in Mark uh 12 and 30 let's have that one Zoe Mark 1230 here's a great promise the Lord's speaking and the the question comes up about you know what's the first of the the greatest Commandments right you're familiar everybody since your days of Sunday school you're familiar with with this one and Jesus said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind am I reading the Bible and with all thy strength this is the first commandment so I propose friends that that once you know the gospel has been fully restored uh in your day then then you become obligated uh to have it applied in your life and willfully willingly obey it I mean am I crazy am I have I gone into left field tonight we're Believers right I know this contrary to the world that says just do what you want to do and whatever feels good do it and there are you know there are no morals there's nothing there's no right there's no wrong there's not even male and female anymore I mean the whole world has made everything relative it's relative to what you think you got no thought coming at all not even a little one amen this is the only thing that we live our lives by this is the standard I can't help what the woke college campuses are teaching this is the standard I can't help what political uh stumps and speeches say this is the standard there's no other standard that's right see amen there's nothing to to describe what a Christian is but this book there's nothing to describe and and give instruction how marriages should work in the place of the man the place of the of the wife this is the only guide book see so when we look at it like that you find that you know once you know it's here and once you know the word has been restored then I think we become obligated to follow it and not just you know from kind of say it like this from not just your heart everybody everybody oh it's in my heart you know and people think lovely thoughts about Christ you know that's that's one of the pro the prophets in the Old Testament I don't remember which one it was now um I want to say it's Jeremiah but I can't remember one of here's a problem he had that he was preaching and preaching and nobody's listening and he he got troubled and he you know he's talking to the Lord nobody will listen they they won't listen to what I'm saying and you know what the Lord told him Lord Lord gave the Lord kind of outed all Society to him and the Lord said the reason that they won't listen to you is because they just think of your sermons as a lovely song they think you're a good singer and and they just think that when you're preaching oh isn't he a wonderful singer and his words are just a lovely song and they don't know that those lovely songs was speaking their doom and so I you know it's not just you know when we when we say that we willfully follow him it's it's from not just your heart or a lovely thought about Christ but the whole thing as Jesus said with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment people don't like a gospel with Commandments in it in the 21st century but but you know never mind that full obedience entitles you to the Token GL amen amen see brother brandham says in the Church of the Living God 1951 I'm going to watch my time tonight I promise man I looked at my iPad when I broke it out today to get it charged up and it was down to like 50% I said my goodness how long did I preach on Sunday I've never drained it down to 50% like that so amen my apologies I I don't even know how long I preached amen praise the Lord so brother brandham says the Church of from the Church of the Living God 1951 he says speaking of God said when I come will I find faith and brother brandham said he never questioned whether he would find righteousness or whether he would find Christians I think we might have read this recently never he never questioned whether he would find righteousness I mean if nothing else there's a form of godliness and so or whether he would find Christians there's all kinds of Christians brother brandham said who aren't CHR Christians of the spirit they've just made a a mental agreement uh with with a historical event see and so he said he never questioned whether he would find that but would he find faith when he returned knowing that that would be one thing people would let go on hearing and now now watch what he ties it to hearing also the Holy Spirit speaking in the last days that how these times would come come when men would have a form of godliness but would deny the power and brother brandham said There It Is lack of faith lack of faith lack of real power and we and he says here we thank thee Lord tonight because that inner Hearts now listen to a Prophet come down to come down and be a human with all of us we thank thee Lord tonight because that in our hearts we feel that we have just a little faith and help us Lord that that Faith may be increased tonight until it be so high so lost in complete surrender to Christ until Great and Mighty Works will be shown tonight I'd like to see some Great and Mighty Works shown tonight I'd like to see a whole church in one mind and in one Accord and I'd like to see everybody from our young people to our old people serving God with a passion see I don't want to wait till Sunday how about tonight I don't want to wait till the next Revival I young people don't wait till next Camp brother brandom called that a campstar don't just be a campstar you go into the shikina go behind the veil go into the presence live there be a third realm dweller see so how about tonight friends it's so it's faith in the restored word alone everything else can be impersonated it's faith in the restored word alone that brings real overcoming power not your certainly not your works of going to church or doing good deeds it's not your labors see and and it's certainly not any man-made religious system or organization those man-made systems can never produce an acceptable sacrifice for God it's impossible because they're built their their whole Foundation is built on seeds of discrepancy see so every seed brings forth of its kind that's nature that's nature every seed brings forth of its kind so if you've got a foundation that's built on a mized version of this then what are you going to grow see so so only the Original Seed can produce the original life that that that's that's nature that's what the Bible says you know I I I become fond of saying this trust the scienceall I know it's not the one that they that they mean and they say that at a political rally but we're not at a political rally we're in a church service and I want to say to you tonight there was no greater scientist than the author of this book so trust the science you cannot find wholesome life when you're feeding on a mongrelized seed and partly that it that it's a seed of discrepancy it will grow discrepancies in your life it's impossible for it not to see so it's Faith because at the end of the day friends it's going to to be God accepting your faith in him which is the same as saying in his word for he is his word I remember brother brandham told that story you've all heard it where talked about a faithful a faithful son you know he's got a a pond he wants to go swimming in his daddy says to him son Gator's in that pond stay out of it he said now if had boys got any sense and loves his daddy he'll stay out of that pond because there's Gators in there who aren't going to respect persons they don't care that he's an innocent little boy so so we realize that modern Christianity you know I I I can say this because I've dealt with it enough uh modern Christianity most any denomination they don't really have uh so much of a severe problem saying that God and his word are the same you know well I mean be pretty hard to deny once you've read John 1:1 in the beginning was the word it was with God and it was God and then verse 14 it was made flesh so it so people say well I love Jesus well Jesus is his word so do you love the historical idea of who he was or do you actually love the one that's the same yesterday today and forever so you know so they they they don't they don't really have a severe problem when brother bradam you know or when you would come today and say well God and His word you know are the same and uh you know but as soon as you say that it must be more than faith in a man on a cross that it and you say it must go on to faith in his word then they go now wait a minute well he is his word they're the same okay well then you got to have more than just a a mental uh acceptance of a historical event you got to have faith in his word how do you have faith in him and don't have faith in his word how do you have faith in him because he is his word and brother Brandon went around the world making that simple unchallengeable Point see and so you know but but but you always hear the same thing oh you're taking the Bible too literally you know just join our church it doesn't really matter how you live in your personal life Young people don't swim in that pond don't swim in that pond my goodness don't don't ever swim there if you're swimming in a pond like that get out of it amen and parents don't don't don't take your children swimming in that pond Hallelujah and there's more there's more kinds of a of those kinds of pond than just than just churches my goodness uh and the things we expose our children to can I say this to you as a dad and as a grandpa let a gator get a hold hold of your child's leg one time cuz he was swimming in a pond and you had him in there and you were swimming with him and a gator Come and you got out and he got a hold of your child's leg it's going to be a lot harder to get his leg out of that mouth see you might you might even pull it off but the damage that's going to be done see so you know you might but it won't be easy and why did you ever take him swimming there in the first place my goodness take your children right when they're oh my young and innocent and super impressionable and set them down in the big middle of these horrible public schools and and then you see that they get connected into all the right Social Circles and the social scenes of popularity you you load them up and you load up your home with worldly entertainments you you you don't realize that you're teaching them parents by your own lifestyle that those things are more important than having the word of God swn into their young hearts I'm sorry if that offends you I'm sorry on the internet if that offends you that's the truth see I just say we need to break this generational backsliding break it seems to be it seem to me it see the backsliding seems to be more and more with every passing generation and and I just say that we need to break that generational backsliding Hallelujah it Waters down a Mighty prophet's message to the world reverse course friends reverse course and and get yourself ready for a catching away you want to do something productive get your children ready for a catching away thank God it's never too late never too late it's never too late thank God it's never too late Hallelujah make up your mind I would say it to you tonight make up your mind don't wait for another service don't wait for another Revival makeup brother Bram said I want to see it tonight make up your mind in this service tonight start your family home on the right direction listen friends we're marching to Zion Romans 10 Zoe Romans 10 we're going to catch verses 1 to 4 this all right not angry I just I'm just full of zeal tonight Revelation 10 1:4 brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved for I bear them record that they have a Zeal of God but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God so catch this fourth verse for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that that does what believe it everyone that believeth so let me let me just reread this fourth verse to you in my own way for Christ in a Believer ends the method of gaining righteousness through keeping rituals and precepts of the Old Testament law every true Christian see you're free of that you don't and that was the problem that those Jews were trying to hang on to that system it was a it was a it was a man system and you say well I thought God with his own finger and wrote it in but but God only did that that was never God's idea that was Israel's idea brother brandham says it's the most irrational thing they ever did they asked for a law when they had a prophet and they had a pillar of fire and they had all of these things and the angel of the Lord and they wanted a law so that they could keep it see so you know this is this is actually I don't know if you've ever given it much thought but this is exactly what necessitated from the Garden of Eden from the fall in the Garden of Eden it necessitated Paradise because Paradise was not in heaven Paradise in the lower parts of the earth Paradise Paradise was a it was not in the torments of Hell there was a great golf at the edge of hell and a great Gulf fixed that no one could cross and the Rich Young Ruler when he died he saw Abraham on the other side and he saw Lazarus who he had stepped over many times begging at his gate so it's a very real place brother brandham talk talks about it you know when they saw Jesus coming and the other one you know Ezekiel said that's the one I Saw the Wheel in the middle of a wheel and Abraham said that's the one I saw and they met me on the plains of memory and the other one said that's the one I saw and this and that's the one I saw and Isaiah said that's the one I saw high and lifted up Hallelujah and so so we know that par I was a very real place because because the the the the the family of God could not come into the presence of God because the Lamb of God hadn't been slain and they they they could be good people they could even keep the law of Moses meticulously but the the closest they you know they didn't go to hell but neither did they go into the realm where God is they didn't even go into the sixth Dimension they they well that could stand correction because that's that's the kind of a broad statement but we know that under the altar of God there's various places and not here trying to teach on Dimensions tonight I've never thought that through but I know that they were not in hell and I know that they were not with God they were in paradise and Jesus went down and preached to souls in prison and then took the keys from Satan and you remember brother Josh said he broke my door I love that door and he broke my door we were having a good time and he' kicked the door in and brother brand him said he took Satan said he he body slammed him and brother R said that he said he slammed him on the ground and he put his foot on his neck and reached and jerked the keys of death Hell In The Grave off his hip and he went over and he and the Bible says he led captivity captive he that ascended was the same who first descended into the lower parts of the earth see and then he come up out of their own Resurrection morning and they all came with him see and there's where brother Brandon picks up the story that he went they went marching off to glory and they went down Glory Road and made a turn at Hallelujah Avenue you remember they come up to the gate and and there all this throng of people since the days of Adam and Eve all the way now and and they said open up the gates and the and you know let the king of glory come in here was Christ leading and the angels call back because you know we got to have the secret word here who is who is it you know what are they asking for what is Christ you know what my answer is he's the word wh which one do you believe I believe the word say Do you believe the man on the tree that he was the word before he was the man on the tree see that's why Jesus said it that that if you believe my word see that's the first prerequisite that he had see then you have then you shall never die he that heareth and believeth see so so we realize then that that he leads them down Hallelujah Avenue and and says father here they're yours you know my my my blood is is on on the cross and I I purchased them and I I paid the price and and now they're actually gone brother benam said they're gone into the into the into the realm where God is that's even higher than the than those that brother Brandon went to in the sixth Dimension under his Altar and said we want to see Jesus said he's up higher he's not the only one up higher see so so we realize that that this paradise exists for that reason because that no matter how righteously they kept the rules and regs they could not go into the presence of God brother brandham says in questions and answers 1964 he said that's the reason we have the troubles we do of married four or five times and this and that and all kinds of sin and adulteries and everything else along in our lives is because of those things we are carnal and that part must perish that's your flesh that part must must perish but then inside we are a spirit man and then he goes further inside of that a soul inside and that's faith in God's word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by Faith by accepting what he said now that's that's faith in the word 101 what I just read you because that's what Paul taught that's Faith 101 one is that you're believing the word of God you're receiving the word of God you're saying Amen to the word in your hour and that's that's faith in God see so so from the Bible knowledge commentary it talks about that this this thought that we read here in in where we we read from Paul's uh words in in the Book of Romans that that that crucial to Paul's this was what was crucial to Paul's EX explanation of Israel's stumbling that that what Israel wanted to do is they wanted to keep using the system of the law they do the they do the same to this day the the Jews do they're still to this day they want to use that system see and there's a there's a veil over them and so they're blind to it and so but but and in fact his friends that's that's exactly going to be the message of Moses and Elijah when they go to the 144,000 the system doesn't work you got to come to Christ we tried to get you to do it 2,000 years ago you wouldn't do it but now he's offering 144,000 and that's the ministry of Moses and Elijah oh my you know what they're going to do they're going to pick up right where Paul left off Hallelujah that's what William brandham did for the Gentiles this is what he tried to tell those Pentecostals you can't use a system of man it doesn't work Pentecost is an experience how many know that it's being born again into the kingdom of God this is the literally the message of Moses and Elijah to True Israel and it's exactly the same message to the true Gentile bride you know what that message is come out of her my people that's the very thing they'll say to those 144,000 come out of these systems don't be up here trying to offer a red he I don't care if it's red over right inside and out it's of no value you got a manora you got a temple you got this you got the pots it's worthless all of that stuff was only pointing to a real person see and so so so then so then Christ then as as Paul taught us Christ is the end of the law so that so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes see who believes his word all right so that in fact is the word translated end in the Greek means that Christ is the designed end he's the termination or he's the purpose goal of the law now Galatians 3 Zoe Galatians 3 I'm going to try to get finished up here I don't have too much more so you still with me Galatians 3:21 to 26 Paul's reasoning is the law then against the promises of God verse 21 God forbid for if there had if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law so hey if there was denominationalism can sometimes seem like a good idea and if there would have been a system that man could have invented and the Holy Ghost could have stayed over the top of it then then you know the Holy Ghost could have come through that system but that's not the case the whole fact that when men create it and oversee it the Holy Ghost is pushed out see so he so he says you know if there had been one that had given life verily righteousness should have been by the law but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the Promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe so what's it all about and and and and and why do they have a law for 1,600 years verse 23 but before before Faith came here's the reason here's why they had it for 1600 years but before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should come afterwards be which should afterwards be revealed verse 24 wherefore the law was our school Master oh okay now I understand 1 1600 years of animal sacrifice it was our school Master to bring us to Christ that we might be justified by faith because friends that was the only thing that was ever going to work you know work to do what to redeem them that was the only way to redeem us back to God back to where we came from do you believe you came from him then it's the only way you've got to come to Christ you've got to come to the word in order to be redeemed you can live a Christian lifestyle and not even beor born again and you'll get some blessings out of that but if you want to be redeemed I'm not here to just get blessings Ruth wasn't satisfied with just handfuls of blessing she wanted Boaz cuz she know if she got Boaz she got the whole field see verse 25 but after that faith is come we are no longer under a school Master see so we're not chasing works and ritual and we're not we're certainly not being a part of a religious system of man verse 26 for ye are all children of God by faith in Christ Jesus and again we come back to it again and again and again Christ is his word see so thank you Zoe so so in one way let let me some let me sum up this this way so it it kind of works backwards in a way like almost like a reverse dominoes one I'm meaning that one leads to the next and then one precedes the the former what one you get this one you got something preceded that you got something that followed that amen so we're working it backwards he added the law first for he added it for transgressions the Bible teaches us that so that they actually became culpable because now they actually know better remember Paul said before I knew it was wrong to do this I couldn't be convicted of the sin of it because I didn't know it was wrong am but then the law told me it was wrong and now you say well isn't that a good thing no it's horrible because I'm in born in sin I can't equal it so I got no chance so the law Paul said the law that was for my good for my for my life the devil used it and manipulated it and now it's killing me that which was good he said was the law bad no God forbid you don't say that the law was good it was meant for Life the law wasn't the problem the problem was you and I we were un we were unregenerate we were born in sin and we had to come to a new birth see so he added law for transgressions then they became responsible because now they know better good grief it's written down in a book called the law and and so at the same time he he also gave them the law to prove to them they couldn't keep it see that they would have to eventually rely on faith in the Lamb of God we've had 2,000 years of churches and churches and churches but but there was always the promise that at the end time he would come back Christ in the fullness of his word and now the whole world is culpable because they know it's there they can see the truth of it in your life and in my life and but but that's not my concern they'll have to answer to God for that I got one concern I'm marching to Zion I want the whole word in my life I I want to be born again the spirit of God I don't just want to believe true Doctrine see so this was actually that John's message repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand you know the Lamb of God as we were saying Sunday he said the Lamb of God is among you now the and and and how will you know him the Holy Ghost will identify him see so God was never going to let that system continue because because he couldn't redeem his family that way you understand he was never going to allow he he added it for transgressions he did it to prove to him they couldn't keep it but he was never going to let that system continue because even he knew he couldn't redeem his family that way and he was always going to redeem them he wasn't doing it for a law for 1600 years he was always going to redeem them God didn't spend 2,000 years to see me in a denominational Barnyard he brought a message to Redeem Me Hallelujah it wasn't about just about compliance and and never having a stumble uh he was always going to redeem them we always are going to stumble so compliance was you know when we talk about it being required I mean we've we spent the first half of this sermon showing that if you're a real Christian you you will be be obligated to the word because you want to be because that's what changes your inside nature and that's the guy got sick of fighting that's the guy that wanted to serve God but he just he wasn't in a position of authority until I got born again and now that Holy Spirit is in authority and now the greatest battle is between him and this flesh and I'm pulling for the Holy Ghost come on Holy Ghost give it to him whatever you got to do hallelujah amen and so it's not about perfect comp compliance which the law you know uh my even if you did keep it you were the problem was you were born in sin see and that's the same thing that's true today and can I say this today you're born in sin so there there really is no amount of message compliance that can redeem you it's not about that it's about falling in love with the person of the message not a rules and regulations book it's about you dying and him coming alive you died willingly he wouldn't he wouldn't Force you but you just said Lord I don't want to be me anymore I want to be you once I see his word I want I want it for me I want it for my family I wanted it for my children I want it for my grandchildren I want it for this whole church I want it for our young people our old people our single people our married people I want you to be filled with the spirit of God hallelujah you must be born again by faith in the revealed word of this hour the hour of his second coming because he's doing it exactly like he did at his first coming it's faith in his word that was faith in him can I say that really strong faith in him is Faith in his word don't ever lose sight of that see cooperating you know with a man-made system of religion can never bring you back into his presence as I said that's why Paradise was built it was a temporary holding place I mean none of God's family could ever go back into his presence everything everything everything was in a perfect stalemate salate Satan didn't have them but neither did God you understand before the New Birth came came by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Satan didn't have them but neither did God they were in a perfect stalemate to see who would blink first Lucifer or Jehovah amen preview of coming attractions oh I'm I don't want to live my life in a stalemate say can you tell me where this is going from here I just did you don't want to live your life in a stalemate don't live your life in a stalemate choose Christ choose his word choose to be born again of the spirit of God choose the Zeal of the Holy Spirit what is the Zeal of the holy spirit it's that spirit that wants to turn you into amateur Gods I'd say that's a pretty good deal wouldn't you amen you love him praise God praise the Lord amen I I love him amen praise God all right what you want to sing brother Matt I a had you five you want do do one of them listen uh I don't care whatever what do you feel we're in a stalemate here between said it's not between
