[28:24] are I don't care if Donald Trump don't
[28:26] know who I am
[28:28] as long as Jesus Christ knows me that's
[28:31] all that
[28:35] matters is this
[28:40] yours if you have your Bibles let's turn
[28:42] to Proverbs Chapter
[28:46] 18:1 I sent the booth about three
[28:48] scriptures I'm just going to read one
[28:50] scripture each so if you don't get to it
[28:52] I'll just I'll just read it so Proverbs
[28:56] 18 in verse
[28:59] 10 the name of the Lord is a strong
[29:03] tower the righteous runthe and is safe
[29:07] so the name of the Lord is a place of
[29:10] safety and
[29:12] refuge so Acts chapter
[29:15] 4:12 this is Peter talking of Jesus he
[29:18] said neither is there salvation in any
[29:20] other for there is none other name under
[29:23] Heaven given among men whereby you must
[29:27] be saved Amen in Philippians 2:9 says
[29:31] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[29:34] him and given him a name which is above
[29:37] every
[29:38] name may God add a blessings you can
[29:41] have your seats for a title this
[29:43] evening a little simple little
[29:45] thought it's all in a
[29:48] name it's all in a name you know a name
[29:51] carries an identity it's an authority or
[29:54] a legacy so throughout the scriptures
[29:57] names are
[29:58] significant because they reveal
[30:00] character and purpose you know brother
[30:02] brand off to emphasize the power of the
[30:05] name of Jesus noting is authority over
[30:08] sickness sin and
[30:11] Satan it's all in a name I thought this
[30:14] was pretty interesting I looked up
[30:16] what's What's the phrase actually mean
[30:17] it's all in a name you heard the saying
[30:19] it's all in a name it's all in name
[30:22] means the essence or
[30:24] key understanding of something in is
[30:28] directly implied by its name suggesting
[30:31] that the name itself fully explains the
[30:34] nature or purpose of something without
[30:38] needing further
[30:41] explanation essentially the name tells
[30:43] you everything that you need to
[30:46] know so when you hear somebody's name
[30:48] you just
[30:51] know when you hear a name of something
[30:53] you just know it's like a race car when
[30:55] you hear somebody say race car your mind
[30:58] don't go to a little
[31:00] Pinto your mind don't go to a little
[31:02] Volkswagen but your mind goes to
[31:04] something that was built for racing
[31:07] something that's built to run
[31:10] fast
[31:12] amen the company there's a company
[31:14] called Healthy
[31:15] Choice when you think of Healthy Choice
[31:17] you don't think of Big Macs Double
[31:20] Quarter
[31:21] Pounders so healthy choice makes you
[31:24] think of healthy foods I'm going
[31:26] somewhere hang on when someone says
[31:28] Lowe's or Walmart it's all in the name
[31:31] you know what they're saying if somebody
[31:34] says Lowe's we're going to go to Lowe's
[31:35] and buy some stuff for the house when
[31:37] you go to Walmart you're going shopping
[31:39] it's all in the name we know what's
[31:40] going
[31:42] on when someone says do side we know
[31:45] it's
[31:47] Seafood it's all in the name amen you're
[31:51] like what in the world that don't need
[31:53] an
[31:55] explanation when I say Walmart you don't
[31:57] need explain to you what Walmart is you
[31:59] automatically
[32:01] know when there's knocking at your door
[32:03] and somebody says open up it's the law
[32:06] you don't go by and say what who's the
[32:10] law you know you better open
[32:15] up there's something about a name you
[32:18] are identified by your name your name
[32:21] tells who you
[32:24] are when someone says Donald Trump
[32:29] we know who he is we know he's the next
[32:31] president of the United States we don't
[32:34] need somebody to really explain who
[32:35] Donald Trump is everybody knows who he
[32:37] is it's like when somebody says LeBron
[32:40] James we know who he is Elon Musk We
[32:43] Know by his name who he
[32:46] is so if you're out somebody says do you
[32:50] know brother Jason
[32:52] Watkins like yeah we know who he is we
[32:55] know who he when you hear his name you
[32:57] know he's the Pastor bethl
[32:59] Tabernacle we don't need no introduction
[33:01] when somebody says Donnie Reagan we know
[33:04] who he
[33:06] is
[33:09] hello you don't have to explain it these
[33:13] people are
[33:14] welln well-known people we don't have to
[33:16] explain who they are there's a lot of
[33:18] people that don't know my
[33:20] name the mayor of Buford don't know who
[33:23] I am the governor of South Carolina
[33:25] don't care who I am and surely Briden
[33:28] don't know who I
[33:29] am but it don't
[33:32] matter my name will never be on a
[33:35] billboard my name is not on the who's
[33:38] who list down here but I thank God my
[33:42] name's on who's who in
[33:47] heaven you keep on naming all those
[33:49] great people you know if they happen to
[33:52] hear my name Brad y they'll say who
[33:56] who's Brad y
[33:59] who is that my name don't mean nothing
[34:01] to them but if you just say my name to
[34:05] Sarah she knows who I am I'm her husband
[34:09] when I hear her name I know who she is I
[34:11] don't need to ask who is
[34:16] Sarah Lord if I do y'all watch
[34:20] out you know when my mom and dads hear
[34:23] my name they don't need to ask who I am
[34:25] they know who I am I'm their son
[34:29] when God hears my name he don't have to
[34:32] look hey Gabriel who's Brad
[34:36] y God knows who I am when he hears my
[34:40] name he knows who I am when God hears
[34:43] your name brother Chris he knows exactly
[34:45] who you
[34:47] are you're the apple of his
[34:50] eye what's the apple of the
[34:53] eye the apple of one's eye refers to
[34:56] someone who is deeply cherished or
[34:59] valued by another so when I say I'm the
[35:02] apple of God's eye I am cherished by
[35:07] God so when God gives a name to
[35:10] something he has something special for
[35:13] that
[35:15] person when God speaks your name he has
[35:19] something special planned for you you
[35:20] know like in the Book of Genesis when it
[35:22] said in the beginning God created the
[35:25] Heaven and the Earth he spoke the
[35:27] Earth's name because he had something
[35:30] special made for the
[35:32] Earth you know he didn't
[35:35] say in the beginning God created the
[35:37] heavens and
[35:40] Jupiter or Pluto or Saturn their nam's
[35:44] not even mentioned in this Bible in the
[35:46] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[35:49] Earth he's got something special for
[35:52] this place we know what it is God will
[35:56] even change your
[35:59] name there's several in the Bible had a
[36:01] name
[36:03] change says if there's something there
[36:06] isn't if there isn't something in a name
[36:09] then why as long as Jacob was called
[36:12] Jacob which means Sur planter
[36:15] deceiver that's who he
[36:19] was God couldn't use Jacob while he was
[36:22] a deceiver but God had to come down and
[36:24] he had to get wrestling with him and
[36:26] change his name so we used to think we
[36:29] hear the name Jacob we think he ain't
[36:30] nothing but deceiver but we we now we
[36:33] hear his name Israel we hear Prince of
[36:37] God Amen
[36:40] Hallelujah Abraham had had to get a name
[36:42] changeed where he was Abram he could not
[36:45] receive a promise until he had a name
[36:47] change until his name become Abraham
[36:50] then he can fulfill the promise you get
[36:54] where I'm going what about
[36:56] Paul when he was he was Saul going and
[37:00] killing the Christians and arresting
[37:01] them he had to have a name change for
[37:04] God to even do God say this is going to
[37:06] be the first my prophet of the age but I
[37:08] got to change his name it's all in a
[37:11] name he couldn't be Saul no more he had
[37:13] to be Paul it's like Simon
[37:17] Peter his name his name was changed from
[37:19] Simon to Peter which means little
[37:24] Stone their names was changed because
[37:28] what you are called is something about
[37:30] it there is something about what you are
[37:35] called someone says it's all in the name
[37:37] they're indicating that it's in itself
[37:40] is significant and gives you all the
[37:43] information you need to understand
[37:47] it so if I was to stand here tonight and
[37:50] say Jehovah
[37:53] Gyra what am I
[37:56] saying the Lord is my provider if you
[37:59] hear me say Jehovah Rafa you know he's
[38:02] my healer when you hear me say Jehovah

[38:55] wearing but I'm glad I had have a friend
[38:58] that Stith closer than a brother I have
[39:00] somebody watching over me all right
[39:02] sticketh means to adhere to to
[39:05] join every person that will go back and
[39:09] watch this
[39:10] service God knows who they
[39:14] are those that listens to criticize he
[39:17] knows who you
[39:20] are God Knows My
[39:24] Name there's a lot of people out there
[39:27] that doesn't know their
[39:29] name they think he
[39:31] does but God knows who we are he knows
[39:35] our name because we have taken on

[39:42] way to take his name is you got to be

[49:40] Jesus it's all in that name in his name
[49:45] there is power so the only way you're
[49:47] going to have power over Satan is take
[49:50] his
[49:52] name the Bible says look unto me and be
[49:55] ye saved all the end of the Earth for I
[49:57] am God and there is none else I have
[49:59] sworn by myself and the word has gone

[50:05] return that unto me every knee shall bow
[50:08] every tongue shall
[50:09] swear one of script we read wherefore
[50:12] God is O exalted him and given him a
[50:14] name which is above every name that at
[50:18] the name of Jesus every knee shall
[50:22] bow things in heaven things in Earth
[50:26] things under the Earth so every Devil's
[50:29] gonna have to bow before that name it
[50:32] don't matter who they are atheist is
[50:34] going to
[50:38] Bow every person will bow what a name
[50:42] such a powerful name that he named his
[50:46] family after the name of
[50:49] Jesus brother brother said what think
[50:51] you of Christ but it was what Jesus did
[50:55] and what he was
[50:57] who was Jesus he was a very Heart Of
[51:01] God what makes his name so reverent
[51:04] tonight that all the family in heaven is
[51:08] named after him in the second seal he
[51:11] said he died the cruelest death didn't
[51:14] have a place to lay his
[51:17] head and when God exalted him so high
[51:20] till he has to look down to see Heaven
[51:23] God in humility he gave him a name so
[51:27] great that the whole family of Heaven is
[51:29] named after him and every family on the
[51:32] earth is
[51:34] named after him all the family Earth is
[51:38] named
[51:39] Jesus all the families in heaven is nam
[51:42] Jesus and such a name that every knee
[51:46] will bow
[51:49] amen if you're a part of God I just said
[51:52] your name was M Jesus Christ BR Brown

[52:13] coming for that's where his name lays
[52:16] this is where his worship is in her and
[52:20] her
[52:21] alone Hallelujah that is
[52:24] true that's why we all we do in word or
[52:29] deed we do it in the name of Jesus
[52:32] Christ there is no other name given
[52:36] under heaven for
[52:38] salvation but the name of Jesus
[52:41] Christ so what is your

[54:09] after God you'll follow God you'll be
[54:12] God you'll act like
[54:15] God all that God does you'll do you'll
[54:18] love

[55:12] and they forgot about
[55:16] me but I want that testimony it's all in
[55:20] his name that's the only reason I can do
[55:22] it Brad y can't go around act like God I

[55:46] Worship in him he meets to cast out
[55:49] devils in him he meets to heal the

[55:57] meets to save and fill with the Holy
[55:59] Ghost that's God's only place to meet

[57:16] altar do you want to get the devil's
[57:19] attention start casting out his
[57:23] demons he don't care if you come to
[57:25] church

[57:44] don't have to fight a
[57:47] battle I'd hate that to be my testimony
[57:49] brother
[57:52] Steve what happened to Peter when he
[57:54] preached on the day of Pentecost
[57:58] 3,000 got saved the devil didn't say a
[58:03] word it wasn't until the very next day
[58:05] when he was walking by the gate and seen
[58:07] that man that no doubt Jesus
[58:10] walked by dozens of
[58:13] times Jesus could have healed
[58:15] him but he wanted somebody to use his
[58:19] name Peter says Silver and Gold Have I
[58:22] None but such as I have in the name of
[58:25] Jesus so the first time this name was
[58:27] used in that way a crippled man be

[1:10:55] was slain the very minute God spoke that
[1:11:01] word then
[1:11:04] what 4,000 years later he came and paid
[1:11:06] that
[1:11:07] price all the devils in Hell couldn't

[1:29:42] all this done I don't have to run across
[1:29:44] town to go get laundry soap I don't have
[1:29:46] time for this and it was like the Lord
[1:29:48] spoke to me and he said then ask me for
[1:29:50] more laundry
[1:29:51] soap and I said Lord I said I need more
[1:29:55] laundry soap to get this done and I kept
[1:29:58] putting laundry soap in each one of the
[1:30:01] I had four or five different machines
[1:30:04] all filled up and I kept putting laundry
[1:30:08] soap and I would think well the Jug's
[1:30:10] almost empty and I'd go to the next
[1:30:12] machine and I'd fill that one up and
[1:30:14] then I went to the next machine and
[1:30:15] filled that one up and then I went to
[1:30:17] the last machine and I was like I hope
[1:30:19] there's enough for this and something
[1:30:20] was like you don't have to hope it's
[1:30:22] there and I filled that machine up and
[1:30:24] then the bottle was empty and that was
[1:30:26] all there was and I shut the laundry
[1:30:28] machines and did the laundry and
[1:30:30] everything come out clean and I was very
[1:30:32] thankful for
