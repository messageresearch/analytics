just hold the music for a second we want to make a uh a couple announcements here regarding camp and I'm going to have brother Jason come up right behind me and just take just about seven or eight minutes um right before we we go into the preaching of the word we thought it was best to get everybody here uh before we made uh some of these announcements and some of the um things that we'll say are just times sensitive and important and also uh we have a lot happening after the service uh when the service concludes the marriage um thing happening there at Urban Brew and then also the skit practice so it's just a lot crammed into one day so if I could just have your undivided attention here just for about 10 minutes um and then uh and then we'll we'll have brother Tony sing again and and go back into the preaching of the word you love the Lord amen so we have Youth Camp coming up we know that um our this Sunday uh next Sunday so one week from today will be our is our day where we pack up the church uh and we get ready to go to camp Camp beginning the following Thursday and so we've been asked a bunch of times by text and then in person uh about the status of camp in regards to the hurricane um that came through and that area was severely uh affected and so uh I just want to say a couple things first off and that is is that just so that there's an understanding we are under a contract with a deposit for the camp and so we don't have a we don't have an option just to arbitrarily say let's just move Camp you know some has said maybe it's just a better idea with all the uncertainty there to do that we really don't have that option so so as long as Carolina Point can have Camp they are expecting us to have Camp um and as we finally did make communication and and have a conversation with the camp director there at Carolina point and thankfully uh their Grounds was really for the most part spared from a lot of the damage in that area and so they had other young life camps that were uh damaged greatly Carolina point just suffered a couple trees I think a tree on the office but they are in their words Camp is ready the only uncertainty still they've already verified the roads from Bard Bard actually got power last Monday um and so they've had power for a week now Carolina Point does not have power so without power we don't have camp and so they are expecting you know that as as much as you could count on that as their expectation that they'll have power uh the beginning of this week or somewhere in this week so really D-Day for us would be probably Saturday uh next Saturday if they don't have power by next Saturday we will have to make a determination at that time on what to do uh and that would mean that camp would be postponed until their next available date we don't have all the answers because there's so much uncertainty still there's another storm brewing right now supposed to hit um over Florida on Wednesday at about 700 p.m. or 7: a.m. I forget and so there's a lot of uncertainty and so these kind of things are challenging um we just can't don't have all the answers and we really can't so it's quite a dynamic situation we do need to pray that if it's God's will for us to have Camp the Lord can restore the power the Carolina Point we've got a lot of kids there's been already a lot of preparation that's went into it and there's a lot of expectation to have it and so um that's uh us that ready but they do need power so they're ready minus power so power comes they're good to go um they have internet already and the the kitchen his own generators um and so we are I just want to say before I bring brother Jason up uh we are in desperate need it's urgent need for help at Youth Camp this year we have a lot of things that we don't have help for uh a lot of a lot of uh let me just say that we have a lot of help but not a lot from our church last year our church really uh helped quite a bit so if it's if if it's possible and if the Lord would put upon your heart to help in some capacity at Youth Camp I think we need shuttle drivers still um AV Jason will go brother Jason will go over some of that here in a second so there is a need for volunteers and help at Camp um and so uh we need assistance you know this is our youth camp this is bethl Youth Camp so our church should be well represented and if there's any way for you you to go and be a help of some kind I just ask that you'd consider that see if the Lord would make a way for you to be able to help out we do need it next Sunday as I said is the day that we'll load up the truck and then the following Monday after Camp is when we will unload and all those times will be announced so God bless you brother Jason come on up amen God bless you so just uh wanted to go over some specific details and also specifically request your help um I think those who have committed to helping for with Camp already have let us know um when they'll be arriving we're just trying to manage all the logistics of that if you haven't let me know when you're planning on arri arriving yet and you're going to be helping please do let me know there's just a few that haven't I think um next Sunday um after after we have lunch we're going to have we're going to a U-Haul here and we're going to do kind of a tear down and we're going to be packing up that U-Haul so um if you are able to we would love to have everybody's help next Sunday the more people that help the faster it will go and the people who are um currently are AV people I just would say make a request uh if if some of you could stay next week after church and assist us with some of the tear down of course the musicians are going to have some of that responsibility as well so just reminding the musicians next week we need you for tear down but where're brother John especially you um um we we need all hands on deck brother George will not be able to be here next Sunday which is uh uh uh a big hit to us so if a few of the AV people can replace brother George that would be amazing um so that's again that's next Sunday that we'll be doing that after we have lunch so the other part of it is just to make everybody body aware there's obviously unloading that has to happen so a number of us are getting up there on Wednesday um before camp and we'll be starting the uploading un unloading so U brother Aaron will be driving the U-Haul up for us so he'll be there and a few of other of us if you want to come up and can change your plans or make your plans to be able to come up on Wednesday to be able to help with unloading they just uh they'll charge us $76 for that extra night um to stay there um appreciate all the help we absolutely can get and if you can get there as early as possible those who are planning to come up on Thursday if you can get up there as early as possible on Thursday to help with the setup there's I mean concessions and and chairs and AV setup and everything else there's there's a there's a ton of work to do so um soon as sooner you can get up there as um brother Matt mentioned we're still working on we may have a solution for a shuttle driver but um with all the different teams we can't really pull the musicians off to put them on shuttle and we can't pull the security off to put them on shuttle so um if somebody got the inspiration last minute to come and you're over 25 years old um that would be amazing cuz we really could use the help to have a shuttle driver and also last year was so amazing everyone that helped after Sunday I just want to put in your mind don't think service is over I'm gone uh we really need help um we have to load all that stuff that we unloaded we got to put it in the truck and get it back down here because we've got to unload it again and set up the AV again so um we'll do that on Sunday after church just just as far as musicians and people in a that are helping with AV and everyone understand like right after church we should get started right away on those things I think concessions will have their own process and we'll need to stay open just for a little bit after that but nevertheless we need all the help and all the hands that we can get after church Don't just run out right away we need help with the tear down and then again after driving four hours home and being so tired from Youth Camp let's get up again on Monday morning and unload that U-Haul again um I think we usually tried not to do too early but like 9:00 10 o'clock something like that because we have to get the U-Haul back after we've rented it and then uh over the next couple days on Monday and Tuesday musicians will have their plan AV Booth will have their plan for getting everything set up so that we can have service on Wednesday so as you can see there's a lot of help that's needed so if if you're able to cancel all your plans and come help us we sure would appreciate that it is a sacrifice we understand that but it's it's for a great great purpose and we all even in our families have many testimonies about the how the Lord used the Youth Camp to bring Salvation and the Holy Ghost to Deliverance to our own children also um skit skit practice uh will be immediately after church today so we the announcement that went out saying we need all all the uh Camp volunteers to meet after church we're doing that now so um I'd like to get everybody's Commitment if you can text me or let me know if you can come uh help next Sunday after church we' we'd like to know that and if you're able to get up there and help at Camp we'd like to know that as well if if some some of y'all changed your mind cuz I I asked everybody and I'm asking everybody again pray the Holy Spirit just Mo sweeps through the building and changes your hearts and uh provides for your bank accounts as well so young people don't leave do not make brother Luther track you down he is good at it and it might hurt so stay here do not leave if you're a part of the skit do not leave stay here come to the front and be ready sister Deb will be ready I don't know if Chris is going to be helping but we can send Chris to track you down too so don't be TR don't need to be tracked down just stay and come to the front right away as soon as Tony dismisses don't walk that way Walk This Way Amen brother Tony you want to come and lead us in song again amen God bless you you love the Lord praise the Lord I um I just want to make a one or two comments just behind um that and you can carry them brother Andrew that's fine um you know um if I could just say it in this way can camp for our young people is hard it's difficult it it requires a lot of Labor and it requires a lot of sacrifice so I think that's the first thing that we have to get in our mind it's going to take sacrifice and it's going to take all of us pulling together but we're doing it one Soul among our youth is worth 10,000 wordss one and we have a whole church full of them we love them this is our opportunity to provide them with a unique environment a unique experience that's focused on their lives and the choices and decisions that they are facing they're facing a mad world a world far worse than we ever faced for us adults um they face things that you know it when I look back and I I see them facing things just in the last 5 to seven years that seemed unimaginable to me where you couldn't even comprehend that it could ever get that far out of kilter and not only is it completely gone crazy but crazy is the new Norm you agree with me and so I just want to say that it only can work the most efficiently if we're all if all of us are all in so whether you have you know teenagers now you may have in the future and maybe you've got uh little sweetie pies now and they'll always stay Sweetie Pies but they'll face different challenges so you know you start looking forward I I've always said to parents who are just raising small children you be very kind to these parents who are raising teenagers because you have no idea yet amen and and so we're all in this thing together and I think that camp is a wonderful time to prove that amen so set some things aside uh willingly inconvenience yourself all of us are are going to be working full steam when Camp is over um everybody's exhausted everybody and so uh but it's worth it amen praise the Lord you believe it we have our married couples Gathering our second one today it's at 3 p.m. at the Urban Brew and um sister Caitlyn tells me all things are ready we're happy appreciate her and brother Kenny and sister Anita amen uh making the Urban Brew a place where we can gather they won't even let me pay them for it I've tried I tried to threaten them coffee the coffee bar is open and uh brother Jason ain't buying your coffee amen so uh the coffee bar will be running uh so you you'll have access to that Sister Sarah I think is bringing dessert again and so we're going to have a wonderful time it's from 3: to 5: we have child care provided two of my granddaughters are stepping up and uh so we want to make sure that if you deposit little lovelies there uh for them to keep up with in the fellowship hall it's from 3:00 to 5:00 make sure you get back amen um by by 5:00 amen we're not it that's not a long event but it is a wonderful event we enjoyed it tremendously last time God bless all of our visitors young man here we've seen him before brother George good to see you again brother Tony sister different ones and family members amen right here God bless you happy to have you here today praise the Lord Brother God bless you happy to have you all here want to have you stand we're going to go to the Lord in prayer then I want brother Tony to sing that song song again sister Brenda Lewis song that song just wow man it's all like it's such an Anthem for the bride before we do that got a couple of prayer requests one is that we want to pray for the homes family um especially for sister Sue um and the children there and brother Mike Wall's assembly there along the Beltway uh brother Nathaniel uh just a young man um got into is you know we don't know all the details yet but he he ended his life yesterday and um the family of course is devastated I I sister Sue wrote me back I'd WR written to her just to let her know we were praying for her and the children and she said of course they are shattered and uh brother Nathaniel loved my wife and I greatly loved my mom loved this church and so we just have to commit those things things to God what else can you do amen it's uh in the hands of the Lord so we just want to be praying for that family sister Brenda also needs prayer today she can't be here she's with her mom um sister Joyce had the heart procedure but they uh went in and came back out and said there's nothing we can do and I happened to know she had the best cardiologist in this area and he said there's just nothing we can do uh she already had open heart surg surgery some years ago she's not willing to do that again and I doubt whether the doctors would be willing to try that again so sister Brenda writes please remember my mom as she continues to have pain and feels like it is leading to another heart attack the doctors are unable to do anything for her we are trusting in the will of God for her knowing he can heal her or let her go home but not before it's her time and in the meantime the natural suffering and knowing from minute to minute if it will be an emergency is hard to watch I need to stay close by to help her at this time please keep us in your prayers God is our comfort and strength and I am so grateful we have him right here with us through this God bless you my church family you mean so very much to me I love you and we sure love sister Brenda amen sister Joyce sister Brenda's whole family amen so let's go to the Lord in prayer if you'll bow your heads all over the building father we are certainly love sister Brenda and her family we think of sister Joyce right now Lord the physical pain that this kind of thing causes she's in such discomfort there's such anxiety and fear that goes along with those things Lord but we're just up holding her up in prayer sister Brenda her mom the boys the whole family Lord may you strengthen them in this hour if it's your will Lord you could increase sister Joyce's Life by many years that's up to you Lord she's certainly willing to stay here and fight the fight of Faith she told me Lord that she desires to be one of those who are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord father maybe you'll honor that request we sure from our heart ask that of thee if you're going to take her home then Lord don't let the enemy just torment her like that I pray you will strengthen her her heart strengthen her mind strengthen that resolve we put strength in sister Brenda and the whole family we love them Lord we're missing them today so father I pray for your mercy Lord we think of sister Sue and the children there in Virginia brother Mike's assembly to have to face such devastating news Lord we had great love for Nathaniel knew him since he was just a boy and Lord we don't understand these things and they're hard to understand but we just give it into your hands we feel Lord at times like the king of Judah who when the enemy was compassed and he just said Lord we have no might against this enemy and we don't know what to do but our eyes are upon thee Lord may you grant it today may all of our eyes look to you today may you bless us now in the word as we turn our hearts and Minds to hear from you pray you'll bless the visitors in our gate today we commit it to you all in jesus' name the whole church Said Amen

Lord amen devil uh always busy but I'm glad the Lord has his angels amen always on the Move praise God all right Genesis chapter 24 and start at verse one we'll get these uh 10 verses and we'll let you be seated and Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abram Abraham in all things and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had this is eleazer put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I will make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but Thou shalt go unto my unto my country and to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac and the servant said unto him per Adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest and Abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then Thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again and the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swear to him concerning the matter and the servant took 10 camels and the cam and the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to Mesopotamia unto the city of naor Amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word as your seated we're carrying on today I think this should be the sixth installment um and in our series opposing the Judgment of heaven and um we want to make some some new ground tracks uh make new tracks today in some new ground um one of the just just uh one or two comments from last time just to acquaint you and gather your mind amen and get us all going in the same direction here we I made a statement to you by Smith Wigglesworth from yester year and the reason reason that I wish to reread that statement to you is because even more so I would even almost Say by far more than I realized when I read it to you last Sunday that it really is the key to what the burden uh of what it means to be able to be a carrier of the word of God in this day and operate perfect faith we not ified you last time that we realize that perfect faith is where is is has always been God's plan and I want to say some on that today I promised you we would take really an an in-depth nuts and bolts breakdown of it I plan to keep that promise but it's not likely I'll get to it today because I'm still trying to get the real Crux of my burden well that be okay we're not going to go long we've got a uh we've already had a lengthy preliminary we've got a lot left left a busy day lot going on so we won't go too far today but I want to try to really make sure I anchor this solidly in your heart Wigglesworth said to hunger and thirst after righteousness is when nothing in the world can Fascinate us so much as being near God so that is telling me that you know the world is filled with fascinating things the world is filled with um tinel and distractions and entertainments and sidebars and sidetracks and reels and shorts and and all kinds of uh media uh that that Vis for the attention of your mind and very rich men in the world are always spending um um eyw watering sums of money trying to outcompete the other guy this guy over his medium wants your attention this guy over here wants your attention this guy over here and they're all spending money who can get the most attention and and here is something that is totally free and will give you eternal life and put you in heaven I would say this is all is what should capture the attention of God's family if your vision is on things above and I'll say more about that shortly so the enemy we we said last time time and say again he always tries to hinder the appeal of the word by turning you aside uh from Our obligation to press every day and so you know uh given that the enemy I made this statement to you last time that given that the enemy is always trying to do that then I think you would agree that it would be sensible advice if you don't help him amen he's already pretty good at his job he's already knows how to appeal to your weakness he already knows how to distract you he's a master psychologist he's been doing it he's been practicing on human beings for 6,000 years so he's he he's no rookie at this see and we are no match for him you say well I'm a Son of God truly so was Daniel and Daniel had an advantage over you was a prophet but the Bible said of Lucifer that he was wiser than Daniel that takes my breath away I I'm like what chance do I have if Lucifer is even wiser than a great prophet of God who when I read Daniel I don't even understand everything he said and now there's somebody even more powerful than him I'm glad there's somebody more powerful than the more powerful I'm glad that my king my father that that he that he he rules the whole world the whole universe and I can really truly actually do all things through Christ who strengthens me Satan knows this so quite naturally any as as any good strategist War Chieftain as any good tactician and studying of war strategy would know uh he knows that the power that we have that it's greater in us than he that's in the world you know that we don't always act like we know it but I'll promise you Satan knows it so he knows listen he knows he can't take Christ head on he's all that's been tried and he failed and got and got deported out of heaven and put into the lower parts of the earth he already knows that every time he comes face to face with the pillar of fire he loses see and we know we know that Jesus stripped him of every weapon that he has but he does have one weapon and it's a Psy it's psychological weapon and that is brother Adam said his greatest his only weapon is if he can get you to doubt your weapon so what now you just think with me what better way would you imagine for him to accomplish that he's not going to walk up and try to tell you Jesus is a liar the word's not true and God's not real he knows better than that see so what all he needs to do is distract you and turn your attention and Fascinate You with other things besides the only thing that will give you strength make sense is that easy see so he knows that so that's why I say given that the enemy is always trying to to do that I don't think we should help him I said to you last time and I'm only mentioning it again because I didn't have the uh figures and I wanted to have the figures The Institute of Bible research are the ones who conducted that study about Bible reading and they found and I said to you last time just reading your Bible we're not even talking about praying and coming to church and fellowshipping the Saints those are all augment they all work together see but just reading your Bible if someone reads the Bible just one day per week it has almost no effect on their life at all that's what the study found if someone reads the Bible two or three days per week you can see it but it's negligible uh in affecting their life a little bit it starts to move the needle just a little bit on the other hand when somebody crosses the Rubicon and begins reading the scripture at least four times per per week the study shows that that person is 30% less likely to struggle with loneliness depression and anxiety imagine imine if you could reduce your anxiety by a third by just reading a book we're not talking about taking a medication we're talking about just reading a book see and so a 30% less likely to struggle with loneliness depression or anxiety 59% less likely to view pornography 228 times more like percent 228 per more likely to share their faith and the the the conclusion of the study is very simple it's very straightforward listen close when the word not the world becomes the majority of your week your whole life and all your priorities will start to change amen is that easy when the word not the world becomes the majority of your weak that's when you're whole life will start to change so we find that that what was what was um you know brought upon the world today that we live in we've talked about how that and I'm I just mean last Sunday I mean this this whole thing of opposing the Judgment of Heaven is that we've talked about the greatest existential threat to human uh existence uh is a is a is a is the deception of the last day and and the deception of the last day is one and the same with the original lie amen the original lie told to Eve in the garden and the original lie was that you could water down God's word and you didn't have to believe every word of it and you didn't have to practice every word of it that you know and that and that lie has has propagated you know in into this last day a especially and uh you know that that that that all you have to do is admire the fine qualities of Jesus and and and and agree that he's the son of God and died to save Sinners and died for you and that that's all you need it doesn't really matter I I had a man saying to me in great sincerity very recently a very fine man we actually became quick friends and I and but but I but I could see the the the blind spot is that he had swallowed the lie that it doesn't matter the grace of Jesus just covers everything you don't really have to worry about how you live or what you change because there's plenty of Grace at Calvary to which I was able to say to him and he received it quite in a friendly way and I I said to him what I've said to you that before the man on Calvary existed he was the word and that word was made flesh and that that flesh man went to Calvary so you can't equate the flesh man in any way less than the word of God made flesh see because that's what he was so when you say you have Jesus you love Jesus you believe Jesus do you believe the word because he was the word before he was the man on the cross simple enough don't need to keep going over that there's one sure thing that will prevent perfect Faith from being a reality in your life and here's one of the little nuts and bolts I am going to touch on today if there is one Sure Thing One absolutely sure thing that will prevent perfect Faith from being a reality in your life and when I say being a reality I mean the functioning of it amen amen now perfect Faith let me say this perfect Faith's not a new thing it's not it's not just oh it's at the end time of the seventh seal and now we we got perfect Faith Joshua was operating perfect Faith amen and he stopped the sun you know why he stopped it because he needed it stopped and he didn't even have to have a prayer meeting to do it he just said Son stand still he operated perfect Faith now there was a reason that he could do that see and then when you and you say well maybe I don't need uh the son to stand still Jesus talks about that you know when you have perfect faith you will say to this mountain be moved be cast into the sea don't doubt it in your heart but believe what you've said will come to pass now that whole doubted in your heart is the is the real key to it all because brother brandham talks about how that Jesus could operate perfect faith in everything he said and did because his heart condemned him not amen he said I do always that which pleases the father so you're starting to see a pattern so Joshua was dedicated to God that's why he could do that and he say well I don't need to move a mountain and I don't need to stop the sun I just need daily overcoming power it was perfect faith that a prophet went back to the life of Job and in all of his trials and all of his afflictions and they were many and they were hard and they were worse than anything any of us have ever went through but he held his faith because his heart he knew that he had not broken God's law and that enabled him in the Old Testament to operate perfect Faith to even when his wife said you should just curse God and die that was the most sensible thing he had heard that was absolutely logical because how could God be real and love and care with all of job's loss after job had given him his whole life I mean what kind of God is this job that you worship what have you done I think of a prophet in our day what have I done but give you my whole life what have I done but preach the gospel night and day day and night I I so you know come in and just collapse in my chair and get a little rest eat some meal go back out and preach on the streets what have I done so weak from fasting I have to put my spurs on just to climb the telephone pole and what have I done but go in the garages and go in the stores and tell everybody I meet man do you know Jesus let me tell you about the love of God and when it comes to your own baby he won't even hear you he won't even talk to you see and a prophet said he said he he said I just said well if that's okay if that's the way it is then I'll just and he's about to say quit but something deep on the inside I'm here to tell you something friends you need perfect Faith you need it this that day he lived in was nothing compared to this day job's day pales compared to this day you're needing perfect faith and and a prophet brought that to us after the seals there 1963 I think I said 65 last week it's actually 63 but you need to be able to operate perfect faith and and so we find out that that then quite naturally in order to prevent you from operating it there's one sure thing that will keep you and prevent perfect Faith from being a reality in your life and that is to believe the lie to believe the lie that God's word can be Sid stepped watered down and that it doesn't it doesn't matter how you live it matters see so today you know unlike other times in this pull pit now now I want to come really to my heart because I I thought to myself that today I would very much like like rather than rather than showing you the awful side of of doing that with all of the negatives that it'll bring on your life and we've preached that and preached on it and preached on it and preached on it I thought today rather than take that kind of approach again for the eenth time today I felt in my heart a desire like Paul had I believe in 1 Corinthians 12 covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way amen I want to today show you a more excellent way we've spent a lot of time uh talking about the negatives and the downside of watering down God's word and what that'll do to your life and the chaos and we've seen it and we all know people who've done that we see the chaos that follows in their life so we could we could spend another service saying don't do that take a stand for the word of God but let me just let me flip it today and just show you a more excellent way I want to tell you something something there's nothing like having perfect faith in your life that it's operating day and night there's nothing so so uh comforting to you is that when that wayward child and you see them left and right and they're they're they can't stay in the middle I'm here to tell you you're going to want perfect Faith oh you're there's nothing like when the doctor says there's nothing we can do for you you're going to want perfect Faith there's nothing like when you when when the when the go exceeds the income you're going to need perfect Faith Hallelujah when a world that's broken and and broke woke and left and crazy and insane there there's got to be somebody that can operate perfect Faith perfect faith and perfect love now because and here's why 1 Corinthians 12:31 is so vital because that's what Paul's point is though I have the the tongues of men and angels though I give my body to be burned and have not perfect love profits me nothing amen though I can do all things and do great Miracles and you know uh Ascend the heights of Everest whatever you whatever it is you think you can accomplish in life though I covet earnestly go ahead covet earnestly the best gifts but even when you do that I can still will show you a more excellent way hallelujah amen and that way is perfect love see and now we're going to find here in a statement brother Brandon makes um an astonishing statement I told I was talking to Brother Brad y I said this could almost be the the the the center of everything I say we could almost read this and go home for the day and be benefited but perfect love and perfect faith brother brandham in in the message perfect faith says perfect he's talking about perfect Faith perfect love that love and faith are Ken folks amen see so perfect love and perfect Faith are kin they are married faith and love Listen to What a prophet says and this is only one of them I I could have read many I may in later Services 1953 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever that's so perfect for me today it was the first one I hit and Hebrews 13:8 is is what I'm is what is so strong on my heart today Prophet says it this way in the 20 years of research of the Bible and talking with the angel of the Lord and the many things I just want you to absorb that for a minute this is a prophet who is saying I talked to the one that led Moses Hallelujah I talked to the one that they followed of a A Cloud by day and a fire by night I talked to the soldier that met Joshua on the other side of Jordan and he said he was the captain of the Lord's army and a prophet is saying 20 years of studying the Bible and talking with the angel of the Lord and the many things I find here is two things that is love and faith if you now we're not talking about you know love like the fuzzy silly feeling that filio human love that we get gooy over one another we're talking about something that far outstrips that amen because human love will fail you that's right see you you say I love that person and that person says they love me if it's not true genuine love of God then hard times will fail that that love is there cuz times are going good but when times begin to get hard or when there's some kind of a a a great disappointment one side to the other I'm here to tell you that will fail let me just say friends that's why uh it's not in my notes and it's feel inspired to take the opportunity that I have this morning but this is exactly why young people listen to me this is exactly why you don't look outside of the ranks of God's family for your Earthly mate see because you say well but they said they love me I can prove to you by the Bible that they don't love you and you don't love them if you don't have the Holy Ghost if because the love of God which is the only real love is poured into us by the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible teaches you understand so I'm not saying that they're lying to you or you're lying to them young person I'm not say accusing you are your are your uh boyfriend or girlfriend I'm lying I'm simply saying what you're saying is impossible that you might feel that you might think that you might absolutely believe that and and listen let let me say this I'm not denying that in human to human relations you can learn to love someone yeah amen I don't they listen they've been having arranged marriages in eastern culture for centuries I remember uh one sister was asked about that an elderly sister when I was over there with some other ministers and brother Bisal and brother Donnie different ones and we were there holding meetings and I you know brother Ed asked one of the Elder sisters CU she was part of an arranged marriage her and her husband have been together since that you know their dads uh put them together and brother Ed asked the question that we all were wanting to ask how do you love someone if it's arranged and she just looked at almost incredulous she said you learned to love yeah so this is a practiced human trait I get it I get it I I'm not suggesting that everyone who's been married for 50 years uh was uh maybe found their their Divine mate that that elected one maybe they've learned to love maybe they learned to make it work you can do that I can't deny that in the face of history and in the face of of of of arranged marriages but I will say this that you are you are selling yourself short to have that perfect one because I'm here to tell you you might learn to love them they might learn to love you it might always never go beyond human fio love and if they don't have the Holy Ghost that's all it can ever be if you don't have the Holy Ghost that's all it can ever be but I'm here to tell you you go ahead and take that but you are shorten shorting yourself on a perfect marriage on finding that divinely elected mate and you're missing out that elected person that's the other half of you is somewhere in the world and a lot of times you've missed that person because you've been trying to find them rather than trying to find he who can bring them to you and Jo you together together amen my I'm already preaching my married couple's material but that's actually not even in my married coup's material for today so just the Lord wanted that said so so brother brandham says I want to start this quote again in the 20 years of research of the Bible and talking with the angel of the Lord and the many things I find here is two things that is love and faith if you love God just purely unadulterated love you've got to have faith in him see It'll accompany Faith every time so if you really have the love of God are you starting to see the picture that the operation of perfect faith is attached to perfect love of God see now we're not just talking about as we've said a love for God because there's a difference a big difference between having a love for God and having the love of God amen and as I've said the love of God is poured into our hearts by the Holy Ghost so he says I find two things that is love and faith if you love God just purely unadulterated love you've got to have faith in him it'll accompany Faith every time and when love and faith gets married you ask what you want to and you'll have it so you're starting to see the key to perfect Faith perfect Faith isn't a new thing at the end time perfect faith has always been operating make sure you don't doze on me amen this is two important material set up and pay attention amen so love and faith go together now you can see that Bible readers you can see that in the text we read in Genesis 24 because he says and I will make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanite among whom I dwell but Thou shalt go unto my country and to my Kindred see so he said so brother Ram says love and faith are kin folks see and you'll go to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son so their kin that is to say that they're from the same family perfect love and perfect Faith are from the same family verse five and the servant said unto him per Venture the woman will not be willing to follow me under this land must I needs bring thy son again to the land from whence thou comest and Abraham said unto him beware that thou bring not my son fither again you see friends you have to understand that that Abraham had already lived there he had already had a previous life to the life he enjoyed now he had a life before he met MDC he had a life before he got the promised son he wasn't interested in compromising and going back to that life if it means getting a bride for my son I won't leave the word and he's saying to his Prophet don't leave the word don't compromise the promised word because the god that who made me the promise he'll send his Angel ahead of you you don't have to abandon the word to find happiness you don't have to leave the word to find Freedom you don't have to leave the word to find peace and contentment you don't have to leave the word to have a healthy marriage or be a young person and be popular don't leave the word to do it you can stay right in the promise of God's word sir my son will not leave the promised word for this day the day is too important of a day friends this is the preparing for the wedding supper this is the preparing to bring forth The Offspring of my seed Gene there's no room for compromise in this hour amen this isn't just any day see there was a day in Abram Abraham's life like in all of our lives there was a day of sojourning much wandering failures yeah caught in lies fear left the promised land goes to Egypt out of fear conniving lying comes out of there carried around that ticking Time Bomb just waiting oh you know when you've got a ticking Time Bomb of sin that you haven't let the Holy Spirit take from you all it needs is the right circumstance and the right atmosphere and it'll blow up again see and and that's why you're never to walk away don't walk around with that ticking Time Bomb down inside you let the Holy Spirit deliver you of it right now today in this service all Abraham he got he gets in a jam and he's lying to pharaoh and then he gets in another jam and he's lying to a BC same lie same exact fear same exact lie I'm here to tell you but I love it when I look in the Bible because once Isaac came on the scene you don't find Abraham doing that once it became sunship once you came once you were sojourning once you were wandering once you had all kinds of problems but once you entered into the sunship of the son of man once you became a child of God you then then never again did Abraham doubt or fear or kite he didn't have to he had met the king Hallelujah see so it's it's the this is the age of the Bride this is the time of the invisible Union this is the time of the Harvest so the there's there's no room for us to believe the LIE there's no room for us to be distracted we need to be all in all on uh everything needs to be primed and ready on a daily basis because you don't never know you say I don't need a mount moved your child might say I don't need to stop a storm your family might need you to say I don't got any kind of a problem without somebody you love might soon have that and you're going to want to have perfect faith and that only comes by perfect love because they're married Hallelujah see all the wondering and all the sojourning it's all come down to this glorious hour no you will not take my son there he's going to marry my Offspring is going to come from my same seed Gene line see verse seven the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me that swore unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence verse eight and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then Thou shalt be clear of this my oath only bring not my son thither again I'm so glad to know the rest of the story I'm so glad to know there was a fair Rebecca waiting oh elaser hadn't met he didn't know who who she was he didn't even know how to find her and so he just stood by The Well of water and he said Lord if you love my master then provide Hallelujah and God what did he do he brought her out of her home brought her into service that's what he did to me that's what he did to you he brought you out of a family brought you out of a church brought you out of a a barroom whatever he did he brought you to The Well of Life Hallelujah I'm glad to know she said I she said I shall th go the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master swore unto him concerning the matter the servant took 10 camels of the camel oh my the servant must have had the same Faith Abraham did because he took all the treasures and all the gifts and all the camels which the camels represented the word that would carry her back Hallelujah the servant I know he asked the question what if she won't come there must have been something of Faith stirring because he went ahead and took the treasures and took the gifts and took the camels I know I'll find her I know I'll find her the angel of the Lord is leading me why would anybody want a different version of The Gospel when we have the the version that's actively being led by the angel of the Lord see there are significantly more signif ific anly more some Scholars suggest it may be as many as five seven8 10 times as many it's it's hard to pin it down because a lot of scriptures in the Old Testament refer to the first coming and the second coming they have a dual meaning and sometimes you you have to be careful how you divide it but but all Scholars agree that there are at the very least significantly more scripture verses throughout the Old Testament and the New Testament that speak of the second coming of Christ versus the first coming see and so so so H how many you know I mean um you know how many have have turned uh today from looking forward right to Looking Backward and you know they they've they've forsaken their own mercies and it didn't matter that their lives fell apart and everybody around them that did the same thing their lives fell AP part marriages exploded and children went haywire and and and and all kinds of horrible things have happened were it not for the grace of God I'm glad there's a grace of God because I'm here to tell you something friends you you can't deny that even sometimes God's family God's the Bible has examples of even God's family doing things like that but the mercy of God was greater I'm so glad that the mercy of God was greater it didn't matter that Peter denied him and ran for his life In The Garden of Gethsemane Jesus said when you gather and meet me go tell Peter I'll be wanting to see him too Hallelujah I'm so glad for the mercy of God so that we find then that that there's too many that look backward at the sacrifice of Calvary as as if that's all there is rather than seeing Calvary as part of a great Symphony that has many parts and many pages deep and many instruments and many players and it has shos and then it'll come down and go back up again then get it powerful then it'll get soft then it'll go forward and and and that's what Redemption is it's a great Symphony the sheet music was written by God before the foundation of the world and it's being played out and they look at Calvary as if as if that's all there is to Redemption rather than seeing it as a part of a greater drama see H now it's true you certainly can't bypass Calvary but neither can you stay there amen amen you can't bypass it don't try that don't just sit in a message church and believe in Doctrine and think you're going to make it you're not you must be born again you must be all you'll do if you do that is you'll grit your teeth and try to live like a Believer should and it'll drive you nuts until you can't do it anymore see I would just say because as I've said the Holy Ghost isn't hard to get the nature change isn't hard to get you you all it re requires is surrender all it takes is a total repentance and surrender of your entire life to God and when God say well I I did that but I didn't get it then God knows your repentance wasn't genuine say well no I really felt it in my heart well then he knows you didn't repent of everything you're not going to make God out to be a liar I'm sorry not while I'm not while I'm alive nobody's going to accuse God of lying you understand they said what must we do and Peter said you must repent and I'm here to tell you that if your repent is thorough and your repent is absolute and your repent is everything No Holds Barred Lord take my whole life I don't want to be me then God will keep his promise and the rushing Mighty Wind will come down into your life as well I don't know what you'll feel or what'll happen to you but you'll find that this Fallen Life Starts coming subject it starts following the the word of God and everywhere where it fails it says Lord forgive me and help me to press on again and help me to press on and help me to press on and that's what it'll do you might shout you might not you might speak in tongues you might not you might dance you might not you might run you might not but one thing you will do you will come subject to every word of God see so so you you certainly can't bypass Calvary but neither can you stay there because he's not still on the cross amen you can't just stay at the cross you just stay at the tomb you can't just stay merely with his Ascension see on when he ascended up on high to to to align ourselves with perfect Faith which is perfect faith and the perfect word the what you you know the the the Bible and and brother brandom especially in that in that message perfect Faith he's repeatedly emphasizing and this is what really has come so clear to me repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly it becomes the theme of his message that he he continues to emphasize that perfect faith is and must be rooted in God's word there's no way to have perfect Faith operating when you doubt part of his word that's just that that's that's an absolute in the universe you're not going to move that see and so it's it's not about personal opinions it's not about personal interpretations it's not about your own personal experiences to operate perfect Faith your desires and your actions must align with the word of God every word without the exception of any of the word see brother brandom says it like this in perfect faith and one of the things I'm doing that I've never done before is I'm jumping all around the message usually I like to have things I'm my OCD wants me to always have it chronologic ically and goes like that I don't really have OCD but devil tries to sell it to me but but but but he says it like this oh what I was saying was that I'm gonna I might here's a quote from paragraph 138 and then later I might read one from paragraph 33 and then I might jump up to 61 and come back to 19 because that that's how uh this this whole thing has come real to me he says here when you got Pure I got to hurry when you got Pure unadulterated Faith Like Your Love Is to your companion amen see here's where we were concluding last Sunday we didn't go into this quote when you got Pure unadulterated Faith Like Your Love Is to your companion then you prove it by the way you act amen that is so simple yeah I I don't see how anyone can can refute that sensibly I mean it is it not the natural typing the spiritual could I could I convince you that I loved sister Debbie if I treated her bad no one would believe that she certainly wouldn't believe it you understand and so it's not just I told you I loved you when I married you if I ever changed my mind I'll let you know that's a joke that's not true right she she she knows every day that I love her she knows every day I'll will never leave her never I will never leave her she'll never leave me we're together for eternity see so when you have a pure love and an unadulterated Faith you see what makes the position of the man I was referring to that I met and spoke to you realize what makes that so untenable to the Holy Spirit you can't say that you have the love of God and not follow his word that's in congruous that's that's illogical that's nonsensical and God won't honor that doesn't matter what you think in your head you've still got to prove it by your life see that's why a prophet would say you might shout or dance or run you might not do any of those things but one thing for sure you will come subject to every word because why because God makes me no do you think sister Debbie all all 110 lbs of her can make me do anything I promise you she can't take me out in the yard and give me a whipping sometimes I'd rather she'd just do that but she has no ability to make me do anything I do everything because I love her and I want her and I live to see her happy and I live to see that smile and vice versa she does the exact same things see and so so he says when you got Pure unadulterated Faith Like Your Love Is to your companion then you prove it by the way you act you ain't complaining no more you know it's done just walk along no matter what the thing looks like what anybody else says you know what's happened you know that it's finished just as well as you know you love your husband as well as you know you you love your wife love and faith has to go together they kin folks they love love produces Faith see so so when you have found I mean look I didn't I I I'll make this statement I'll make this statement I'm a little bit ahead of myself but I want to I want to make the statement so that you can get it and you can understand it when it comes to perfect Faith now hear me because I've thought a lot about how to say this when it comes to perfect Faith you can't go get it amen all you can do is prepare yourself to receive it amen you understand amen perfect faith has to come from God the best you can have is human faith and be that as it may that may that may not that even human Faith with all your human faith brother brand talks about some people just have a bulldog Faith they can just I mean even even brother Brandon would catch uh women and men in the prayer line who weren't living right and they would still get healed because brother said that's just Faith they they that that that Dean of that college told him of that bible school said brother brandom I had a lot of confidence in you till I heard you say that Satan can't heal and he says why we've got a a a soothsaying woman we've got a a magician woman you know uh in our community and people walk in and they bring a piece of their hair and she does puts something in it and throws it over her back and the the disease Jesus leave the people and brother brandham wrote him back and he said I'm surprised that a scholar a man of your stature would say to me that Satan can heal when Jesus said he can't amen said that woman all that woman is doing is she's people are putting their faith in that and Faith moves and brother Brandon would stand there to that young woman and he would take the ceiling fan and he would say now just watch it and he would start making it rotate and he would stop it he'd start making it back rotate he go to the mini blind or the the window blind he'd raise it and cl and close it just by looking at it she said brother bandam that's spiritualism he said it's not spiritualism all it's just Faith he said another place give me any crossy child I'll straighten her eyes just by looking at him and he could prove it he could prove it he said now as soon as she gets outside they'll go back cross again see they asked him do you have to be a Christian to get healed he said no you don't have to be a Christian to get healed he said you need to be a Christian if you want to stay healed amen see because it's it's your faith in God that's just like that gift of discernment as perfect and Flawless as that was and never missed and yet brother brandom said it never healed anybody all it did was give people Faith to believe what God had already done for them what Christ did at Calvary every Redemptive blessing is yours because of Calvary see and so so we realize then that that that when we talk about perfect faith that you have to understand that perfect faith is not something you go get it it's something you prepare yourself to receive and then you are trained in the word of God how to operate it see so so that I said I jumped ahead of myself to say this just like when you when you found your loved one you didn't go unprepared you you you heard there was going to be a youth Gathering there's going to be a youth camp there's going to be some young people you didn't just go unprepared you didn't go your pajamas with Bed Head you heard there was going to be a pretty girl there you dressed up you cleaned up I hope so and you you walked in there's only one chance to make a first impression and so you you you prepared yourself to go receive something if you loved her you're going to want to make sure it gets reciprocated so what did you do you couldn't go you you couldn't I mean that's how perfect Faith Works you can't go demand it see you you know it's um it's it you can't demand it um you you can't even expect it until you prepare yourself make sense see so he says they kin folks love produces faith when Satan tempts us we are to resist him in a perfect faith in a perfect word so that's how it's going to work a perfect perfect faith in a perfect word how you going to get perfect Faith to work if you don't have perfect faith in the perfect word see so so when Satan tempts us we are to resist him in a perfect faith and a perfect word like Jesus did the word of God is perfect we we're to have perfect faith in this perfect word and resist Satan Jesus had perfect Faith he had it and it come because he was the word and then you become the word you become the word as you receive the word amen you see you see what's happening when you read it more than once or two or three times in a week when you when you read it a lot you are what you eat the Bible says we are transformed into the things we gaze at so what are you gazing at say I got this problem that problem this week because I can't overcome it what are you gazing at what are you feeding on see this is not rocket science you understand many of God's true Born Again children struggle for years over things they can't defeat and that's why perfect Faith would take that thing and annihilate it if you know how to operate it see so he he said if you and so now look at the premise here's what it's based on he said you become the word he says it again you become the word as you receive the word he quotes the Lord if ye abide in me and my words in you is that what Jesus said see my words which this word abides in you then ask what you will and it'll be done for you see so when we look at it like that friends and I'm coming down to a close just make these last comments so we come down because that we are infused with eternal life you believe you are infused with eternal life then then that gives me an an eternal perspective would it not if you're infused with eternal life remember brother brandham said if I had the life of John Dillinger in me I'd carry guns and rob banks if I had the life of Harry Houdini I'd do magic tricks and be an escape artist you know and so he says but so if I say I've I'm in if I have the Life of Christ then how will that not make my nature like his see so when you're infused with eternal life you have an eternal perspective then your life becomes a willing vessel for all the training you will ever need for the world to come and training can be difficult but what training for an army is not difficult people don't be in this day it's just it's just so sad that people are not willing to have hard work and face things just face things just you know they they have aund say man up Cowboy Up you know girl power all these different things I'm here to tell you that's all people whistling by a graveyard there is a way to man up there is a way to be a real Son of God a real daughter of the Kingdom you feed upon the word of God you become the word of God and I'm here to tell you the word of God ain't afraid of the devil the word of God ain't afraid of a mountain that needs moving the word of God ain't afraid of those things the word of God will defeat Satan anytime anywhere under any condition and the word of God will speak us the word of God will stand up and speak up see and so so a lot of times we have to set our mind on things above I I thought about that when when we were T when when I was reading that study from the Bible Institute my goodness what an exponential jump from two to three times a week to uh four four days a week and uh what an exponential jump and I thought you know it's about setting your mind on things above and and and can I can I say it like this I'm not limiting when I say set your minds on things above which the Bible commands us it's not about merely thinking about Heavenly principles it's a it's it's it's equally or more so uh it's setting your mind on things going on above amen things going on on above this is about life going on in another realm that's what it means to set your mind on things above I'm aware there's a whole another life going on above me I it's it's there I believe in a in a right now heaven right now I believe that it's operational it's up and running it's a real place and it has real influence on our lives and Angels really do move in around us hallelujah oh what they are planning for and they're building and they're actively preparing for the life that is to come very soon for all of God's family for all those throughout the world who have put their trust in him you know I think about the people in the Bible I think about Moses Moses saw them Ezekiel Saw them Isaiah saw them Zachariah saw them Paul saw them brother Ram saw you know what you know what all these men saw that John went there John saw it you know what they saw they saw activity yeah they saw people in movement they saw angels praising they saw living creatures influencing they had a SE a glass they they had a Heavenly Host they had Elders 4 and2 of them Hallelujah heaven is real and it's really happening and it's influencing the Earth and it's influencing me and I just say Lord God let this Earth be influenced by that Heavenly realm Hallelujah Daniel 8:13 we read this last week then I heard one Saint speaking and another Saint said unto that certain Saint which spoke how long shall be the vision oh friends that's the Multiverse I'm interested in I don't care what Marvel does or what Hollywood does I know there's a I know there's another world there's another universe and I know I'm a part of it I can feel its influence on my and I want to have it more not less more and the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to lay aside the weights and sins that so easily beset me so that I can run this wrath so that I can have perfect Faith attached to perfect love in a perfect word oh and let a perfect God as brother I'm said watch a perfect God keep a perfect promise hallelujah oh it's real friends do you know him in that way today do you really understand that that that perfect Faith stand with me perfect Faith Anthony come with your team want to say it again perfect Faith it's not something you go get it's something you prepare yourself to receive amen you know what it is it's the mind of Christ flowing through you unfettered unhindered that's perfect faith when the mind of Christ can use you as a conduit into the world that his influence can come from Heaven flow through you with no hindrances you see brother Bram says the reason I didn't read it for you let me just say it me brother Brad we're about to have a Runway rejoicing about this in the back room the reason Jesus could so easily operate perfect faith is his heart condemned him not that's the secret he said I do always that which pleases the father you remember he he said that he told the disciples and he said Satan cometh he findeth nothing in me that's what I want that's what I want how many want that today say I would to God that when Satan comes and he will he'll find nothing in me but I only believe amen I only believe all things are possible to them that only believe amen you love him God bless you today friends I'm going to have to stop
