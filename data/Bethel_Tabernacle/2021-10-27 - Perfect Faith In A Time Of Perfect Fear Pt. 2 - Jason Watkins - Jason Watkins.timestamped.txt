[34:51] from sunday
[34:55] where we were in second peter chapter 1.

[35:19] catch this one here and we'll let you be
[35:20] seated i want to continue on tonight
[35:23] with
[35:23] fear faith fear versus faith i think is
[35:27] how i titled it faith versus fear amen
[35:31] and if you remember
[35:33] that i
[35:34] had in the
[35:37] subtitle
[35:38] that
[35:39] we have we're at a time where it's
[35:41] perfect faith in a time of perfect fear
[35:44] and that is the hour that you have
[35:47] arrived at friends and i you know and i
[35:49] i just want to say that the world is
[35:52] falling apart and i can't stop that
[35:55] i'm just here to tell you right now if
[35:57] you're looking for brother jason or the
[35:58] ministry or somehow the word in this
[36:01] hour to stop the world from
[36:02] disintegrating
[36:04] it's not going to happen
[36:05] see
[36:06] and you have to remember that that that
[36:08] jesus never sent the gospel to save the
[36:11] world because
[36:13] you know the very same jesus who sent us
[36:16] into the world go ye into all the world
[36:18] and preach the gospel also prophesied
[36:21] that the world is going to come apart
[36:23] and go read matthew 24. so
[36:26] he he he never imagined uh you know like
[36:30] like does the roman church um the
[36:33] catholic church imagines that they
[36:35] because of their influence and power
[36:37] they can actually bring the millennium
[36:39] to the world and that's that's not going
[36:42] to happen that's a pipe dream the only
[36:44] there there as brother branham said
[36:46] there will be no peace till jesus comes
[36:49] and establishes his kingdom right here
[36:52] on the earth amen and so
[36:54] the gospel did not come to save the
[36:57] world the gospel
[36:58] came to save god's children out of the
[37:02] world
[37:03] amen
[37:04] and uh and and
[37:05] and
[37:06] and as a beautiful wonderful
[37:09] um
[37:10] uh uh what we would call an effect of
[37:13] that uh christ died while he was here he
[37:16] died for the sins of the whole world
[37:18] so that whosoever will
[37:20] can come and believe
[37:22] and be saved amen so god and his
[37:25] benevolence didn't have to do it that
[37:26] way he didn't have to save anybody but
[37:29] he wouldn't lose his children
[37:31] and he could have just come and just
[37:32] said it's just my kids and that's it but
[37:34] he actually gives a legitimate chance to
[37:36] all mankind to believe on the word and
[37:39] save himself from this untoward
[37:41] generation most won't that's the sad
[37:43] reality um but all we can do is preach
[37:47] the gospel i'm just glad for this i'm
[37:48] glad i'm a believer
[37:50] and i'm glad you're a believer and i'm
[37:52] glad that eagle screamed and i heard it
[37:54] amen come out of babylon and i heard it
[37:57] and i said okay i'll come out
[37:59] hallelujah i sure enjoyed that song
[38:01] brother steve amen appreciate that so
[38:04] much praise the lord what a set of pipes
[38:07] amen for a second peter chapter one and
[38:11] we're gonna um
[38:13] we're gonna start this time we're gonna
[38:15] start um
[38:23] you know i think i will
[38:26] uh oh i'm not gonna find my verse did i
[38:28] say first peter
[38:30] i meant second peter i'm sorry second
[38:32] peter ii peter here we go okay
[38:36] verse chapter one verse one and we'll
[38:39] kind of skip along i'm not going to read
[38:40] it in its entirety
[38:42] but
[38:43] first of all i want you to understand
[38:46] clearly because i made this statement to
[38:49] you sunday now i'm about to prove it to
[38:51] you i'm going to let you read it
[38:51] yourself
[38:52] you're going to see very clearly who
[38:55] peter's preaching to
[38:57] who these statements he's about to make
[38:59] you're going to see here who he's making
[39:01] them to all right
[39:03] simon peter
[39:04] a servant and an apostle of jesus christ
[39:07] to them that have obtained like precious
[39:10] faith with us
[39:11] through the righteousness of god and our
[39:14] savior jesus christ now is there any
[39:16] doubt who he's talking to all right
[39:19] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[39:22] through the knowledge of our of our god
[39:24] and of jesus our lord
[39:26] now watch according as his divine power
[39:30] might someday give it to us
[39:34] that how it reads
[39:36] according as his divine power hath
[39:40] given unto us
[39:41] all things that pertain unto life and
[39:45] godliness
[39:46] through the knowledge of him that hath
[39:49] called us to glory
[39:51] so you you probably can read that and
[39:54] understand why faith then comes by
[39:56] hearing the word
[39:57] see
[39:58] because it comes through this knowledge
[40:00] of god and god uses his word and the
[40:04] foolishness of preaching to
[40:06] to describe and to get peoples to
[40:09] understand what god is like now the holy
[40:12] spirit still has to make it real to you
[40:14] for it to have a changing effect on you
[40:16] but you can understand the methodology
[40:18] here that god uses his word and your
[40:22] faith in his word is what catches his
[40:25] attention
[40:26] that's when that's when you have access
[40:29] to every promise and i want you to
[40:31] notice
[40:32] according as his divine power hath given
[40:36] it's already in the past anything that
[40:38] you're going to want from god and pray
[40:41] and believe you receive it you're going
[40:43] to have to put it in the past tense
[40:46] amen if a farmer
[40:48] wants to grow a crop
[40:50] the sowing of seed has to be in the past
[40:55] he can wish all day wish upon a star
[40:59] for a crop but unless he has in the past
[41:02] put the seed in the ground no crops
[41:04] coming
[41:05] amen so if you want to reap the promises
[41:08] of god take them in your mind in your
[41:11] heart in your confession and put it in
[41:13] the past and say he has already done it
[41:18] i'm already healed i'm already delivered
[41:20] i already have victory
[41:23] say well it doesn't your symptoms and
[41:25] brother ram said symptoms don't have one
[41:27] thing to do with the promise
[41:29] that's zero to do with the promise see
[41:32] all right as far as god is concerned
[41:34] it's already done if he can just get you
[41:37] to confess it that way
[41:39] verse four whereby are given unto us
[41:42] exceeding great and precious promises
[41:45] that by these you might be partakers of
[41:48] the divine nature having escaped the
[41:51] corruption that is in the world through
[41:53] lust and besides this now he's clearly
[41:56] established he's talking to people who
[41:58] are born again of the spirit of god just
[42:00] like he was all right and now he's going
[42:03] to say listen you don't have to live
[42:05] below your privileges
[42:08] and i'm going to say well peter great
[42:10] tell me how i can live an overcomer's
[42:12] life here he goes all right
[42:14] give all diligence
[42:16] add to your faith virtue and divert your
[42:19] knowledge and he goes down this long
[42:21] list of seven characteristics of the
[42:24] nature of god and remember they're in
[42:26] the gene of god in you already that's
[42:28] that's how you got them you didn't win a
[42:30] lottery
[42:32] i didn't give you a seat of god
[42:35] the gospel is a seed jesus called it
[42:37] that but when it comes to a gene of god
[42:39] that comes from god from the eternities
[42:42] and you are always that and that's why
[42:44] brother branham would say everything you
[42:45] have needed for a rapture is in you now
[42:48] it's in the past tense it's already i'm
[42:51] going in the rapture
[42:53] i'm going in the rapture because i'm
[42:56] part of the rapture amen see and so so
[42:59] now but but what about the here and now
[43:02] what about life in real time i want to
[43:04] be an overcomer i want to partake of
[43:07] these precious promises and i don't want
[43:09] to have to wait to heaven i want a part
[43:11] of the divine nature right now
[43:13] peter says
[43:14] glad to know that you're at the right
[43:16] place how do i do it peter all right now
[43:17] you're going to start adding you're
[43:19] going to start building it up you're
[43:20] going to start increasing it and and
[43:22] there's ways to go about that see so so
[43:26] that's why when we come then to verse 8
[43:29] verse 8 for if these things be in you
[43:33] and abound
[43:34] here's what they do they don't allow you
[43:36] to do it they make you that ye shall
[43:39] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[43:42] knowledge of our lord jesus christ but
[43:45] he that lacketh these things not doesn't
[43:48] mean you don't have them it means that
[43:50] they're they're not built up
[43:53] you're a little weakling
[43:55] you're a king's child living like a
[43:56] pauper
[43:58] living well below your privileges
[43:59] because you haven't taken the necessary
[44:01] steps for spiritual strength
[44:04] it's not rocket science it's real easy
[44:06] to do see
[44:08] you coming here to service tonight to be
[44:11] in the atmosphere of the holy spirit
[44:13] just be around all these people who are
[44:14] bringing their little leaks of fire hear
[44:16] the word of god preached do you know do
[44:18] you know the preaching of the gospel
[44:20] cast out devils
[44:22] did you know singing cast out devils
[44:25] do you know that brother kenny's main
[44:26] job up here is to bind and drive back
[44:29] evil spirits it's not to entertain you
[44:32] it's not to entertain you it's not to
[44:33] hear hear himself sing he's up here
[44:36] under an anointing of god with the gift
[44:38] of god to do what bind the enemy driving
[44:41] from the people so that when the word
[44:43] comes forth you're ready to go
[44:47] amen
[44:48] so this is why we put our all into it
[44:50] this is why we're all in this together
[44:53] when i'm preaching and you're listening
[44:55] we're in this thing together
[44:57] brother kenny brother anthony brother
[44:59] matt brother matt
[45:01] whoever's leading brother brad whoever
[45:03] is leading singing we're all in this
[45:05] together
[45:06] amen
[45:08] for if these things be in you and abound
[45:12] they make you
[45:13] that ye shall neither be barren nor
[45:15] unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[45:17] jesus christ but he that lacketh these
[45:19] things blind cannot see it far off and
[45:21] hath forgotten that he was purged from
[45:23] his old sins wherefore the rather
[45:25] brother in other words instead of that
[45:27] come on don't be like that give
[45:29] diligence
[45:31] to make your calling and election sure
[45:33] it's amazing
[45:35] how often we give diligence to other
[45:37] things
[45:38] other than that
[45:41] we give all kinds of diligence to
[45:42] entertainment
[45:47] we very diligently keep up with our
[45:48] teams
[45:50] we very diligently keep up with our
[45:52] social media
[45:54] amen brother charles i see you shaking
[45:55] your head no thank you god bless you
[45:57] anyway
[45:58] but y'all's like not me
[46:00] praise the lord
[46:02] amen
[46:03] but what about giving diligence to make
[46:05] your calling and election strong
[46:08] and sure and rugged
[46:10] see so so he says for so and entrance
[46:14] verse 11 shall be ministered unto you
[46:15] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[46:17] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[46:19] wherefore
[46:21] i will not be negligent friends
[46:24] i i don't care how many how tired you
[46:26] get of hearing me say these kinds of
[46:28] things i will not be negligent amen i
[46:32] will not i refuse to be negligent to put
[46:34] you always in remembrance of these
[46:36] things though you know them i know you
[46:39] know them you know you know them you
[46:40] know i know that you know that you know
[46:42] them
[46:43] but i am still going to bring them into
[46:45] your remembrance
[46:47] why are you going to do that
[46:49] and so that you can be established in
[46:52] the present truth now present truth
[46:54] doesn't mean the truth you heard sunday
[46:57] it's the truth you need today
[46:59] because every day is getting darker
[47:01] every day is getting worse and you need
[47:03] to be established daily
[47:05] i die daily paul said why to establish
[47:08] myself in the present truth
[47:11] it's great what god did for me
[47:13] months ago but i need him i need him now
[47:16] i need him right now
[47:18] amen may the lord add blessings to his
[47:19] word god bless you can be seated
[47:29] so
[47:31] now let's uh have my powerpoint up guys
[47:36] and we're just going to go studiously
[47:38] through this tonight we're not going to
[47:39] keep you long
[47:40] and um
[47:42] we've had a very exhausting last several
[47:44] days
[47:45] my own body and my mind a man
[47:48] weary and uh but boy we have we had a
[47:50] good time wow sunday was epic we're
[47:54] going to remember that service for a
[47:55] while
[47:56] and then we were able to have such
[47:58] wonderful fellowship with
[48:00] brother andrew and all of his family and
[48:02] the rehearsal and then the wedding and
[48:05] boy we had a good time at that yesterday
[48:07] and
[48:08] and uh didn't get home till dark 30 and
[48:11] amen so we're feeling it a little bit
[48:13] physically and mentally but boy i'm also
[48:16] feeling this amen
[48:18] amen so i'm sure happy to have somebody
[48:20] out tonight to preach to
[48:22] so we have been talking a lot on sunday
[48:25] we showed you how
[48:27] that
[48:28] you know we we we have
[48:31] human weaknesses and anybody that's
[48:33] gonna say i don't have them well
[48:35] well i'm glad you're at church because
[48:36] liars need to be at church
[48:39] amen uh we've all got our ups and downs
[48:44] amen we've all we're all men and women
[48:47] of like passions we have our ups and
[48:49] downs brother ramsay that's what that
[48:50] means elijah himself was a man of like
[48:53] passions brother ram said that many had
[48:55] his ups and downs but i'm you know i
[48:57] love it how that brother branham goes
[48:59] into detail if you go back and you
[49:01] listen to his hebrews series i think in
[49:03] part two he preached like seven parts of
[49:05] that and i think in part two or chapter
[49:08] two however they they label that there
[49:10] and brother branham talks about that and
[49:12] he just you know in his in his homespun
[49:16] down-to-earth way it's not no fancy
[49:19] dialogue it's not a fancy monologue he's
[49:21] not using big greek words he just starts
[49:24] talking about our human weaknesses and
[49:25] said you know sometimes you make
[49:28] mistakes and he said sometimes you do
[49:30] things that's wrong and he said but just
[49:32] remember he said jesus is there to
[49:34] constantly intercede for you said
[49:36] because he loves you
[49:38] he loves you and he's not going to lose
[49:40] you and he and he knows the weaknesses
[49:42] that we suffered i i i sit back and i
[49:45] say lord i'm so glad that you understand
[49:48] my weaknesses and you love me i have a
[49:50] prophet saying you love me and he says
[49:53] even if you do wrong he said you just
[49:55] repent said he'll forgive you every time
[49:58] every time he'll just keep forgiving you
[50:00] every time brother brahma said because
[50:02] he loved you
[50:03] that's why he did it he loved you and so
[50:06] we we do have as paul said fightings
[50:09] without and fears within and paul
[50:11] himself being 14 days uh stranded at sea
[50:15] and paul even said you know we despaired
[50:17] of life itself i mean paul almost gave
[50:19] up and ready to die so so let's give
[50:22] ourselves a little bit of a break we are
[50:24] humans
[50:26] and we do have natural fears and natural
[50:28] anxieties but you know these natural
[50:31] human anxieties and fears
[50:33] notwithstanding we showed you last
[50:35] sunday that fear to the level where it
[50:38] becomes unbelief that that that that is
[50:42] the absolute
[50:43] opposite of perfect faith
[50:46] and in fact is perfect faith and perfect
[50:49] fear are mutually exclusive terms it's
[50:53] impossible for them to be both true at
[50:55] the same time in a single person
[50:57] because brother branham said now you
[50:59] have 10
[51:00] fleshly senses right
[51:02] you have 10 senses of your spirit your
[51:05] conscience reason affection and so forth
[51:07] but he said in the soul that only has
[51:10] one channel it's either faith or doubt
[51:13] either it's converted or it's not either
[51:16] it's light or it's dark
[51:18] amen so so so we find then that that the
[51:23] when when we look at how
[51:25] that god
[51:27] created the world with his word and we
[51:29] were dealing with with that last sunday
[51:31] how that you know just just by his
[51:34] spoken word
[51:36] alone with no one to help him and he
[51:40] didn't need any help
[51:42] he just spoke and created all the
[51:44] galaxies and all the worlds and worlds
[51:46] of worlds
[51:47] and he literally put space into an ex
[51:50] into an into an uh ever unfolding
[51:53] ever increasing and and science now
[51:56] recognizes that they said we can't find
[51:58] the borders of the of the of of space
[52:01] because we actually believe it's
[52:04] probably
[52:05] constantly expanding
[52:07] to which i've always said that's good
[52:09] because the bible speaking of the
[52:11] kingdom of christ says of the increase
[52:13] of his kingdom there shall be no end and
[52:16] so i just said an ever-increasing
[52:17] kingdom is going to need an
[52:18] ever-increasing universe
[52:20] oh my friends think about what you're a
[52:23] part of here tonight
[52:25] and so we we
[52:27] we
[52:28] put it to you that you know how would we
[52:32] how would we allow ourselves
[52:35] ever to get into a position yet we do
[52:38] as humans that's why we have to come to
[52:39] church and hear the preaching that's why
[52:41] judgment begins at the house of god
[52:43] i'd love to come out here and and and
[52:46] preach you a disney world sermon
[52:50] i'd love to just have a permanent smile
[52:52] put on my face and and and have a big
[52:54] glowing you know silver globe turning in
[52:57] the background and
[52:58] an auditorium with 30 40 000 people and
[53:01] just tell you that jesus loves you so be
[53:03] a good neighbor
[53:04] but i'm sorry judgment begins at the
[53:07] house of the lord and but but just just
[53:09] understand that before i ever come here
[53:12] and get onto you i'm sitting in an
[53:14] office and he's getting on to me
[53:16] amen we're all
[53:18] in this thing
[53:20] together
[53:22] aren't you glad
[53:23] amen
[53:25] and so
[53:26] we we begin to look at how that would we
[53:30] ever want to allow
[53:32] weights that hinder us and that's why
[53:34] paul would say come on
[53:36] lay aside those weights
[53:39] that that that's so
[53:41] easily beset you
[53:43] they so easily slow you down i mean
[53:46] listen friends i spent a life working
[53:49] where i where i climbed ladders and
[53:52] you know and you get you get roofers
[53:54] that climb ladders and painters climb
[53:56] ladders and construction men and there's
[53:59] one thing to climbing a ladder with no
[54:01] tools and there's a whole other thing to
[54:03] climbing it with tools on then there's a
[54:05] whole nother thing to climbing it with
[54:07] tools and supplies on your shoulder
[54:09] i'm here to tell you something friends
[54:11] you'd much rather just climb it without
[54:12] all that stuff lay aside the weights
[54:15] that so easily beset you and climb into
[54:18] the upper atmosphere
[54:20] see
[54:22] and so how would we not want to do that
[54:26] lay aside those things that hinder us
[54:29] from this access that we have and the
[54:32] results that we are
[54:34] entitled to say what results precious
[54:37] promises we read them
[54:40] peter says by these that's the part of
[54:42] the divine nature precious promises that
[54:45] by these you may be a partaker of the
[54:47] divine nature
[54:48] say what's the advantage of having the
[54:50] divine nature
[54:52] the divine nature created everything
[54:55] the divine nature is all powerful
[54:58] the divine nature can't be defeated
[55:00] the divine nature can't be refused the
[55:02] divine nature has all authority
[55:05] going to tell you something friends i i
[55:07] like i like going through life knowing
[55:10] that whatever i ask in the name of the
[55:13] lord jesus christ and don't doubt it in
[55:15] my heart i shall have what i've asked
[55:17] for
[55:18] see
[55:19] and so we talked about how that
[55:21] redeeming the time is so very important
[55:24] we prove to you i think pretty
[55:26] conclusively how important it was it's
[55:28] more valuable than money it was more
[55:30] valuable than anything
[55:32] and so
[55:33] when we began to look at that we came to
[55:35] this question
[55:38] all right and so in faith versus fear
[55:41] and perfect faith in a time of perfect
[55:44] fear and then i ran through
[55:46] these scriptures showing that we don't
[55:48] need to read it all again you can go
[55:49] back sunday and catch it but i i want to
[55:52] come to this quote here in obama and
[55:54] gilead
[55:55] but when the one of the one of the last
[55:57] things that we left you with last
[55:59] weekend
[56:00] was how that
[56:02] we we begin to ask you the question
[56:05] that what real
[56:07] uh value
[56:09] you know
[56:10] what real eternal good
[56:13] say well i'm going to redeem the time
[56:14] and we were careful
[56:16] to show you that we're not just talking
[56:18] about going to taking a time management
[56:20] course
[56:22] i'm going to operate more efficiently
[56:23] i'm going to officially i'm going to
[56:24] take a time management course i'm going
[56:26] to take a leadership skill class well
[56:28] those things are awesome i'd recommend
[56:29] every ever everybody take those i'd
[56:32] recommend every young man for sure find
[56:34] and take those classes
[56:36] because they they teach tremendous
[56:38] leadership skills time management
[56:41] operating very efficiently they're
[56:43] awesome i i think it should be part of
[56:45] standard education and and to a degree
[56:47] it is but i think that that one of the
[56:49] things we're lacking in this day is
[56:51] efficiency yeah you know everybody's
[56:53] just playing
[56:56] the whole world just playing and and you
[56:59] you they're even struggling now because
[57:01] they can't get anybody back working
[57:04] and and you men here business owners
[57:06] understand that you can't even find
[57:08] people who are even willing to work at
[57:10] any amount of money they'd rather just
[57:12] they'd rather just do nothing
[57:16] and so that they asked brother branham
[57:17] you know said should we
[57:19] continue to work our jobs and brother
[57:21] braham's like good sure
[57:23] only he said only a christian will
[57:25] really work
[57:26] see because you work as unto the lord
[57:28] not preaching on that tonight let me get
[57:29] off of it
[57:31] so so but but when we when we thought
[57:34] about
[57:35] you know
[57:36] real eternal good
[57:39] what what real and eternal good
[57:43] would it do you
[57:44] to redeem your time
[57:47] just by
[57:48] time management classes or leadership
[57:51] courses
[57:52] because none of those
[57:54] have an eternal value
[57:56] they have no eternal good they could
[57:58] help you here in life but what real
[57:59] eternal value do they have that's not
[58:03] the kind of redeeming the time that paul
[58:07] that peter and paul and john and james
[58:10] and all the apostles were constantly
[58:12] preaching on
[58:13] because we realized that to really
[58:15] redeem the time and this is what we
[58:17] really what we're trying to prove to you
[58:19] over the weekend that
[58:21] that peter is showing you how to redeem
[58:23] the time paul was showing he said put on
[58:25] the whole armor of god pray always
[58:28] without ceasing
[58:30] this is how you redeem the time add to
[58:32] your faith virtue add to virtual
[58:33] knowledge add to these things this is
[58:35] how you redeem
[58:37] the time
[58:39] see that's where you get
[58:41] the real there is no better way
[58:44] than god's way
[58:46] for realizing in your life the many
[58:49] rewards
[58:50] that he has promised to the overcomer
[58:54] now
[58:54] brother brennan makes this statement in
[58:56] obama and gilead
[58:58] the one thing that we have to do excuse
[59:01] me the one thing that we have to move up
[59:03] to now
[59:04] is a supreme faith to what we have had
[59:08] now
[59:09] this goes all the way back to the azusa
[59:11] revival he's saying everything that
[59:14] we've had
[59:15] under luther wesley even the azusa
[59:19] street revivalist
[59:21] we're going to have to go further
[59:23] and he's saying this in 59 he said
[59:25] listen he already knew
[59:27] even before the seals were open he
[59:28] already knew where we got to go further
[59:30] brother brannon would say in another
[59:32] quote the church can't go in the rapture
[59:35] in its current condition and the and the
[59:37] real rub is it can't get any better
[59:41] amen you're talking about a gordian knot
[59:43] you're talking about a conundrum you're
[59:45] talking about no way out
[59:47] it can't go like it is and it can't
[59:49] improve
[59:51] okay so how do i get there right
[59:54] you can't
[59:55] well how do i improve you can't right
[59:58] why not because they're they're refusing
[1:00:00] the word
[1:00:02] they're rejecting christ they're
[1:00:03] eventually going to completely put him
[1:00:05] out of the church
[1:00:08] and that's when the message is going to
[1:00:09] come and god's going to loose the seals
[1:00:11] and send forth the prophet with the
[1:00:12] spirit of elijah and call you out of
[1:00:15] that doomed system
[1:00:18] doomed it's doomed there's no way you
[1:00:21] can't even fix it it can't even be
[1:00:23] redeemed anymore it's past redemption
[1:00:26] those systems of man are
[1:00:29] done
[1:00:30] finished god will not operate in them
[1:00:32] any longer that that's what happened
[1:00:35] that's what paul was trying to point out
[1:00:36] to the jews they said well good grief
[1:00:39] we've had sixteen hundred years and
[1:00:41] you're telling us it's over and paul
[1:00:42] said yep
[1:00:44] but we've been bringing them and moses
[1:00:46] told us and we've been bringing these my
[1:00:48] my daddy his daddy his daddy his daddy
[1:00:50] his daddy his daddy is daddy you're
[1:00:52] telling me that now when i bring my lamb
[1:00:54] god's not even going to accept it that's
[1:00:56] what i'm telling you
[1:00:59] because the lamb of god has come that
[1:01:00] time has passed that window is closed he
[1:01:03] will not honor that anymore you're going
[1:01:05] to have to come and receive the holy
[1:01:07] ghost
[1:01:10] so
[1:01:10] once the cry of the message went out
[1:01:12] come out of her my people there was no
[1:01:14] option to stay in her
[1:01:17] no way not not not and be redeemed see
[1:01:20] the unwise virgin are safe from
[1:01:22] destruction but they finally come to
[1:01:25] their senses in the tribulation and and
[1:01:27] actually refuse to take the mark of the
[1:01:29] beast and that's god's grace to them
[1:01:30] because they're truly sanctified people
[1:01:33] so brother branham says here he says now
[1:01:35] the one thing that we have to move up to
[1:01:37] now is a supreme faith to what we have
[1:01:40] had i'm really going to watch my time
[1:01:42] tonight i'm not going to not going to
[1:01:43] wear you out so just stay right with me
[1:01:46] you cannot have that faith until you
[1:01:48] know perfectly what you're doing just
[1:01:50] say
[1:01:50] well i'm going home
[1:01:52] i'm going out and start the car
[1:01:55] that's all an act of faith
[1:01:58] and you're sitting here subconsciously
[1:02:00] and i'd say hey
[1:02:03] i hear it raining outside well somebody
[1:02:05] go out here and crank up your car and
[1:02:06] drive it up close the door so sister
[1:02:08] davey don't have to get wet she can get
[1:02:09] in your car real quick
[1:02:10] and everybody'd volunteer and you
[1:02:12] wouldn't give a thought that i can't go
[1:02:13] out there and crank my car
[1:02:15] because it's unconscious to you you've
[1:02:17] done it so many times
[1:02:19] say that that's that's faith yeah
[1:02:21] brother brahman said he's actually going
[1:02:22] to show you watch this
[1:02:24] he says i'm going to start my car that's
[1:02:26] all i can pay tomorrow i will meet you
[1:02:28] in a certain place
[1:02:30] that's all an act of faith because
[1:02:31] you've just done it so much because it's
[1:02:33] a regular routine with you well that's
[1:02:35] the way the things of god are
[1:02:38] after you have trusted him and watched
[1:02:40] him do so many things till it becomes
[1:02:43] just like a regular routine
[1:02:47] and that's the condition i think the
[1:02:49] church will be in just before the coming
[1:02:51] of the lord so the rapture will just go
[1:02:54] right on that way it'll just be a
[1:02:56] regular routine of following the
[1:02:58] scriptures and the plans of god amen now
[1:03:02] he's not saying you're christianity
[1:03:04] become ho-hum
[1:03:06] not saying it just be routine it's not
[1:03:07] saying you'll just take god for granted
[1:03:09] what he's saying is that you'll develop
[1:03:12] a systematic
[1:03:14] habitual lifestyle of following the
[1:03:18] scriptures for the plans of god to work
[1:03:22] in your life
[1:03:24] those are the people who are going in
[1:03:26] the rapture
[1:03:28] and it'll just be as routine as i'm
[1:03:30] gonna go start my car real quick
[1:03:33] see
[1:03:35] that's exactly
[1:03:37] what
[1:03:38] god and a prophet caught it even years
[1:03:41] before it began to fully manifest itself
[1:03:43] he caught it
[1:03:44] that it that's what it would take and
[1:03:46] that that's what it would be later
[1:03:48] some years later he's going to repreach
[1:03:50] this thought in the sermon called
[1:03:52] perfect faith and he's going to go back
[1:03:54] and he's going to say it again just in a
[1:03:56] different way he's going to say now
[1:03:57] you've had a faith
[1:03:59] he said but i'm trying to get you now to
[1:04:01] understand
[1:04:02] perfect faith amen see
[1:04:04] so
[1:04:05] so there is a faith that we are aiming
[1:04:08] at
[1:04:09] and and as i said sunday this this is
[1:04:12] superior
[1:04:13] uh i mean there are a number of
[1:04:16] of uh human because there is a human
[1:04:18] faith and it's good it's a good thing
[1:04:20] it's important well i think i think
[1:04:23] sunday we mentioned to you the right
[1:04:25] mental attitude
[1:04:26] remember that one
[1:04:28] the right mental attitude toward any
[1:04:30] promise of god we'll bring it to pass
[1:04:32] see eventually
[1:04:34] there's another one called brother brown
[1:04:36] called it the uh
[1:04:38] the adopt a baby
[1:04:40] that's what he could play with it's
[1:04:41] called the adopt a baby faith he talked
[1:04:44] about sisters who couldn't have children
[1:04:47] and and and it became an anxiety and
[1:04:49] became an anxiousness to them and as
[1:04:51] they and they wanted him more and more
[1:04:52] and more and he said the the harder they
[1:04:54] tried the further away from it they got
[1:04:56] because they were trying people would
[1:04:58] come up into the into the prayer line
[1:05:00] and brother bran will say now you're
[1:05:01] trying real hard to believe he said but
[1:05:04] you're actually hindering yourself
[1:05:07] see because you're you're trying to make
[1:05:09] yourself believe it he said don't do
[1:05:10] that just believe it so what's the
[1:05:13] difference how do i do it he said just
[1:05:14] accept it and walk on thank god for it
[1:05:16] and just go on
[1:05:17] and he said god will let you get well
[1:05:19] and you'll see it it'll unfold in your
[1:05:21] life the your your your faith will
[1:05:24] materialize and it'll catch up to you
[1:05:26] and overtake you and the next thing you
[1:05:27] know you're healed next thing you're
[1:05:28] delivered next thing you know you're out
[1:05:29] of a jam next thing you know this that
[1:05:31] and that and and how many have can
[1:05:33] witness that's how god has operated many
[1:05:35] times he don't always use miracles
[1:05:37] if he always use miracles they wouldn't
[1:05:38] be miracles
[1:05:41] see so this is a walk of faith this is
[1:05:43] this is where god i know this is
[1:05:45] practical tonight but i think it's
[1:05:46] valuable to us
[1:05:48] and and and and this this takes some
[1:05:50] effort this takes some zeal this takes
[1:05:52] some diligence
[1:05:54] yeah you know be diligent to make your
[1:05:55] calling and elections sure add to your
[1:05:57] faith come on get with it don't let
[1:05:59] these things if these are in you and
[1:06:01] super abounding they make you perfect
[1:06:05] you'll never even fall
[1:06:08] how about that one for a friend's
[1:06:10] benefit
[1:06:11] see
[1:06:14] so
[1:06:15] and so brother brandon said she's trying
[1:06:17] to have a baby he said so a lot of times
[1:06:21] if she'll just go adopt a baby
[1:06:24] then that'll
[1:06:26] flip a switch in her psyche
[1:06:28] and now that that love has got an outlet
[1:06:32] and then she won't be struggling to have
[1:06:34] a baby because she's got one and he said
[1:06:36] then she'll get pregnant
[1:06:38] see
[1:06:39] and
[1:06:40] and that's that's barring some physical
[1:06:42] reason why she can't be but but brother
[1:06:44] branham was just saying he's not saying
[1:06:46] that was a foolproof way but that is a
[1:06:47] way that it can work he'd seen it work
[1:06:49] many times i've i've seen that happen
[1:06:50] many times
[1:06:52] but what we're talking about tonight is
[1:06:54] something superior to the right mental
[1:06:57] attitude it's something superior to the
[1:06:58] adopt-a-baby strategy because in those
[1:07:02] you're you're having to work hard to get
[1:07:04] faith to work
[1:07:06] but you have to understand the third
[1:07:08] poll is him working it through you as a
[1:07:12] surrendered vessel that's the difference
[1:07:16] one is a mental gymnastic one is a human
[1:07:18] effort you're you're having to work to
[1:07:20] get faith to work but a real perfect
[1:07:23] faith isn't about that perfect faith is
[1:07:26] christ has come in this age and he said
[1:07:28] i've got it i'm ready to give it to you
[1:07:30] i'll operate it through you what do i
[1:07:32] need to do lord just surrender
[1:07:36] just get your life out of my way
[1:07:39] and i will live through you and i will
[1:07:42] bring the word to pass in your life that
[1:07:44] whatsoever you say will come to pass
[1:07:47] because you've decluttered your mind
[1:07:50] you've decluttered your heart you've
[1:07:52] made changes maybe you even made career
[1:07:54] changes maybe you even made geographical
[1:07:57] changes
[1:07:58] you did whatever it took to get you out
[1:08:01] of the picture amen and you walked in
[1:08:04] the ways of god's word and then then
[1:08:07] it's not you needing to do anything it's
[1:08:09] just you surrendering every day
[1:08:12] and you're always in this state of ready
[1:08:14] usableness for god that he can just
[1:08:16] wouldn't it be lovely for god to know
[1:08:18] that when he needs something done
[1:08:20] somewhere in beaufort county he doesn't
[1:08:22] have to kind of go um i need somebody uh
[1:08:26] wow
[1:08:27] gabriel you got any ideas i mean
[1:08:30] good grief all those believers in
[1:08:31] bethlehem got a single one wouldn't it
[1:08:33] be great if somebody could say if an
[1:08:35] angel could say lord there's a certain
[1:08:37] need and lord just say yeah this just
[1:08:38] said luther
[1:08:41] he can do it oh sure yeah
[1:08:43] oh oh just just send just send gene
[1:08:46] she'll do it yeah no worries you want a
[1:08:48] woman sure woman can do it as good as a
[1:08:49] man she can believe me just as much as
[1:08:51] the man can you you sure you know this
[1:08:53] is all it'll take lord you reckon you
[1:08:55] reckon i i better send aaron with luther
[1:08:57] and a pretty big guy and luther can
[1:08:58] handle himself but he might need some
[1:09:00] help no we're going to help
[1:09:01] you're going to sit there and by himself
[1:09:03] it wouldn't matter wouldn't that be
[1:09:04] amazing if we had if god knew that every
[1:09:07] last one of us
[1:09:09] say oh
[1:09:10] there's a there's a really bad spirit in
[1:09:12] that school i need a i need a teenager
[1:09:14] full of the holy ghost oh i can tell you
[1:09:17] right now just run down there and get a
[1:09:18] hold of this one they'll handle that for
[1:09:19] me
[1:09:20] amen you say that's kind of nonsense
[1:09:23] that's not nonsense that's what god is
[1:09:26] trying to get us to that's what the
[1:09:28] third poll is all about it's god living
[1:09:31] in skin in real time right here at the
[1:09:33] end time
[1:09:36] see
[1:09:39] that's where the power of creation lays
[1:09:44] that's where the power of the spoken
[1:09:46] word operates
[1:09:48] you see the the struggle
[1:09:51] you know to receiving the holy ghost new
[1:09:54] birth
[1:09:56] it's a shame
[1:09:58] that that is
[1:10:00] because of
[1:10:02] and i don't say it's by any means on
[1:10:04] purpose
[1:10:05] but over the years i saw that preached
[1:10:08] in such a way
[1:10:10] that it literally
[1:10:12] caused young people
[1:10:13] to struggle over getting the holy ghost
[1:10:16] and it was never
[1:10:19] ever
[1:10:20] to be struggled with
[1:10:22] the the
[1:10:24] listen friends if you understand it this
[1:10:26] way the struggle to receive the holy
[1:10:29] ghost all right
[1:10:31] um
[1:10:34] you the the struggle
[1:10:36] is not the in the ceiling
[1:10:39] getting the seal
[1:10:41] the struggle is in surrender
[1:10:45] the seal is easy
[1:10:47] the holy ghost gets his promise
[1:10:50] he'll absolutely give it to you
[1:10:52] immediately you don't have to wait 10
[1:10:54] days or 10 minutes
[1:10:57] you don't have to wait any time at all
[1:10:59] brother ernie before he passed away he
[1:11:01] was sharing a quote with me last time he
[1:11:02] was here and he was talking about how
[1:11:05] that brother branham was in a and a
[1:11:07] prayer line and he was talking to a a
[1:11:09] man and had come to a situation he said
[1:11:12] you spent six years
[1:11:15] trying to accomplish this in your life
[1:11:17] he said when you didn't need to spend
[1:11:19] more than six minutes
[1:11:21] he said you didn't even need to spend
[1:11:22] more than six seconds
[1:11:24] because it was a promise of god that you
[1:11:26] should have had immediately by
[1:11:27] disbelieving it and accepting it
[1:11:29] so but you kept struggling with it
[1:11:31] remember
[1:11:32] the the the struggle is not getting
[1:11:34] sealed the struggle is in the surrender
[1:11:38] see that's where the struggle is even
[1:11:40] and then even after the new birth by the
[1:11:42] holy ghost baptism then there begins the
[1:11:45] daily struggle of overcoming see
[1:11:48] and so so when it comes to operating
[1:11:50] overcoming power your struggle is not in
[1:11:53] the promise of god's word
[1:11:56] your struggle is in surrender yes amen
[1:12:00] see
[1:12:01] your struggle
[1:12:02] is getting it your struggle is to accept
[1:12:06] god's way of reaching it
[1:12:10] overcoming power is not hard to achieve
[1:12:13] if you're willing to go god's way to get
[1:12:16] it
[1:12:17] say well pray tell
[1:12:19] god's way i read it to you in a text
[1:12:21] yeah amen add to your faith virtue add
[1:12:24] divert your knowledge add these things
[1:12:26] add these things put on the whole armor
[1:12:28] of god
[1:12:29] pray always pray without ceasing gather
[1:12:32] yourselves together the more so as you
[1:12:33] see the day approaching amen
[1:12:36] these are practical nuts and bolts way
[1:12:39] that we are able to uh that we're able
[1:12:42] to get ourselves out of the way see and
[1:12:46] so ii peter 1 and ephesians 6 you just
[1:12:50] remember you heard brother jason say
[1:12:52] this those are the ways
[1:12:54] ii peter chapter 1 and ephesians 6 are
[1:12:57] the instruction manuals to surrendering
[1:13:00] to getting yourself out of the way and
[1:13:02] getting yourself out of the way is the
[1:13:04] secret to breaking into overcoming power
[1:13:06] yeah yeah see it's what gives you the
[1:13:09] strength to surrender because sometimes
[1:13:12] people are just too strong they're too
[1:13:14] prideful
[1:13:15] see
[1:13:16] and so you know knowing this then then
[1:13:20] we come back to that question that i i
[1:13:22] hope penetrated you sunday and if if you
[1:13:25] didn't hear it you weren't paying
[1:13:26] attention maybe you got distracted i'm
[1:13:28] going to ask it again now that you know
[1:13:30] this method now that i have shown you in
[1:13:33] the scripture then then could you
[1:13:36] continue
[1:13:37] would any of us
[1:13:39] continue to not
[1:13:41] prioritize
[1:13:43] the redeeming of your time to god
[1:13:48] would you leave a service sunday and
[1:13:50] leave the service tonight or maybe
[1:13:51] you're at home hearing the stream and
[1:13:53] you're not going to make effect any
[1:13:56] changes or adjustments to your schedule
[1:13:59] whatever whatsoever
[1:14:02] see
[1:14:04] redeeming your time
[1:14:06] by spending time in prayer redeeming
[1:14:09] your time by spending time with this
[1:14:12] living god in worship
[1:14:15] and in thanksgiving this very being who
[1:14:19] created all things by his word
[1:14:22] time in fellowship
[1:14:25] i hope that's just blows your mind as
[1:14:27] much as it does mine the opportunities
[1:14:29] that are right at your fingertips to
[1:14:31] spend time to have fellowship with the
[1:14:34] same being that brings with him the same
[1:14:38] word of power and and creation that he
[1:14:41] can speak it into your life and you can
[1:14:43] be a champion
[1:14:46] for the lord in the last days
[1:14:50] amen
[1:14:52] we find a principle
[1:14:55] in the book of daniel give me that caleb
[1:14:58] uh daniel chapter
[1:15:00] 10. i wasn't going to have you turn to
[1:15:02] it but i think i will just read it
[1:15:04] familiarize you with it daniel chapter
[1:15:06] 10 and we'll catch
[1:15:08] verses 11 to 13. daniel now has been
[1:15:11] praying for 23 days
[1:15:15] and
[1:15:16] we find then that
[1:15:17] he said unto me the angel
[1:15:19] gabriel says to me oh daniel a man
[1:15:22] greatly beloved understand the words
[1:15:25] that i speak unto thee and stand upright
[1:15:27] for unto thee am i now sent and when he
[1:15:30] had spoken this word unto me i stood
[1:15:32] trembling
[1:15:33] then said he unto me fear not daniel for
[1:15:36] from the first day that thou didst set
[1:15:38] thine heart to understand and to chasten
[1:15:41] thyself before god thy words were heard
[1:15:44] and i am come for thy words
[1:15:48] but the prince of the kingdom of persia
[1:15:50] withstood me one in 20 days but lo
[1:15:54] michael one of the chief princes came to
[1:15:56] help me and i remained there and and
[1:16:00] with the kings of persia so
[1:16:02] now this angel goes on to say we don't
[1:16:05] need to read it you can take that down
[1:16:06] caleb this angel goes on to tell him now
[1:16:08] here is what god's answer is and now
[1:16:11] when i leave here i got to go back and
[1:16:13] fight some more
[1:16:14] see
[1:16:15] and now sometimes we get so afraid of a
[1:16:17] fight
[1:16:19] we don't mind praying
[1:16:22] lord send me an angel and the aim's
[1:16:24] going to fight
[1:16:25] but we don't want to fight
[1:16:28] angel comes said you know he's beat up
[1:16:30] and bruised up and bleeding say man what
[1:16:32] happened to you i had to bring an answer
[1:16:34] to you what are you going to do with it
[1:16:35] oh i don't know i'll think about it
[1:16:39] you mean you sent me you sent me through
[1:16:41] all of this struggle just so you can
[1:16:42] think about it you wanted god's you
[1:16:44] wanted god's opinion so you could think
[1:16:45] about it
[1:16:48] my
[1:16:49] so we find this principle that we have
[1:16:51] to press through many times
[1:16:54] this upper resistance that we see typed
[1:16:56] out in the book of daniel because in the
[1:16:58] spiritual listen friends in the
[1:17:00] spiritual understand this
[1:17:02] and the spiritual the prince of the
[1:17:04] power of the air which is what the bible
[1:17:06] calls him in the new testament prince of
[1:17:08] the power of the air which is satan
[1:17:10] he he literally is the prince of the
[1:17:12] power of the air between the son jesus
[1:17:15] christ
[1:17:16] the lie who's the light of the world
[1:17:18] amen and the children of god and so
[1:17:22] the this is when we see it represented
[1:17:24] here in daniel how that when he went
[1:17:27] down in prayer and then finally gabriel
[1:17:29] says to him hey man you know three weeks
[1:17:31] ago when you started fasting and and and
[1:17:34] finally he said gabriel common and
[1:17:36] brought him brought me my answer the
[1:17:38] first day you consecrated yourself god
[1:17:41] heard it the first day that god heard it
[1:17:44] he told me go down there and give that
[1:17:46] man wisdom but the prince of persia
[1:17:48] withstood me
[1:17:50] and finally michael came and helped me
[1:17:52] but i'm here to give you this wisdom so
[1:17:54] so a lot of times friends now that was
[1:17:57] that wasn't even nothing compared to
[1:17:59] laodicea
[1:18:00] so you ever wonder why you sometimes get
[1:18:03] down to pray and it just seems like you
[1:18:05] it's so
[1:18:06] dry you don't even want to
[1:18:08] yeah
[1:18:09] so let me tell you something be willing
[1:18:11] to work a little bit
[1:18:13] be willing to get up early while it's
[1:18:15] still quiet be willing to get to
[1:18:17] yourself be willing to
[1:18:19] do the old-fashioned thing get your
[1:18:20] prayer closet
[1:18:22] spend some time sit quietly sing some
[1:18:25] songs you've got to break through those
[1:18:27] atmospheres if you can visualize that in
[1:18:30] your mind that has helped me more than
[1:18:32] anything in my prayer life that has ever
[1:18:34] helped me singularly is that i remember
[1:18:37] that i've got to press my way up through
[1:18:39] these atmospheres that are trying to
[1:18:41] stop me trying to distract me trying to
[1:18:44] fill my mind with all the thoughts of
[1:18:46] the day that i can get to later
[1:18:48] this is god's time i'm going to spend
[1:18:50] time with the lord i'm going to close
[1:18:53] out the world amen i'm going to do that
[1:18:56] every day of my life
[1:18:59] see and in there that's when i find
[1:19:03] his word alone can help me
[1:19:06] amen
[1:19:10] this is why this is exactly why
[1:19:14] that the bible shows us
[1:19:17] that it requires the effectual
[1:19:20] fervent prayer
[1:19:22] of even a righteous man
[1:19:25] to avail much
[1:19:26] amen
[1:19:27] think about that now
[1:19:29] it takes the effectual
[1:19:32] fervent
[1:19:33] prayer
[1:19:34] of a righteous man to avail much
[1:19:39] because this is the age that we live in
[1:19:42] this is exactly why it takes that see
[1:19:45] and so his word alone needing no help
[1:19:49] needing no other help i'm here to tell
[1:19:51] you is able to do
[1:19:54] in you
[1:19:55] and to you
[1:19:56] and for you
[1:19:58] every promise that he's ever made
[1:20:03] i'm preaching and teaching on you
[1:20:05] tonight on
[1:20:07] perfect faith
[1:20:09] i'm letting you understand friends that
[1:20:11] brother branham took all
[1:20:14] of the movement of christ in seven
[1:20:18] contiguous church ages
[1:20:20] they weren't just con continuous they
[1:20:23] were they were continue contiguous they
[1:20:25] all came up they even overlapped they
[1:20:27] didn't just butt up against one another
[1:20:29] they actually overlapped
[1:20:32] and and brother branham takes in all 2
[1:20:36] 000 years of the operation of faith and
[1:20:39] he comes to the last day and he said now
[1:20:40] listen and this last day we're going to
[1:20:43] have to have something more than those
[1:20:44] ages had
[1:20:46] we're going to have to go all the way
[1:20:47] back to what saint paul had
[1:20:50] before the church began to fall away
[1:20:52] when they had the abstract when they had
[1:20:53] the token when they had the jubilee when
[1:20:56] they had the fullness of the word when
[1:20:58] the when the when the word was made
[1:20:59] flesh in a mini-membered body of christ
[1:21:02] of believers when even it was so much
[1:21:04] that even peter's shadow would heal
[1:21:06] people
[1:21:07] and and brother branham is saying listen
[1:21:10] you're not going to be able to survive
[1:21:11] with the great with the faith grandma
[1:21:13] had you're not going to be able to
[1:21:15] survive with the with the faith that
[1:21:17] that the ages produced it was great it
[1:21:19] was wonderful those movements were great
[1:21:21] and founded by great men followed by
[1:21:23] great people but the hour has gotten so
[1:21:26] dark you're gonna have to move into a
[1:21:28] perfect faith say perfect faith let me
[1:21:30] go back and let me can i change perfect
[1:21:33] faith to this
[1:21:34] original faith
[1:21:37] the original faith that's what they had
[1:21:40] they had the original perfect jubilee
[1:21:43] the original perfect abstract title deed
[1:21:47] they were the church of the lord jesus
[1:21:49] christ
[1:21:51] amen i i got a sermon i've been working
[1:21:53] on one of those four or five i told you
[1:21:55] been cooking in my mind
[1:21:56] since we started halting services and
[1:21:58] that gift don't turn off and i want to
[1:22:01] take a number of services on what is the
[1:22:04] church
[1:22:05] what is the church see
[1:22:08] and we want to take a real close look at
[1:22:09] that because there's so many privileges
[1:22:11] there that a lot of times you might have
[1:22:13] things that god is god is laying
[1:22:15] treasures all around you and and you
[1:22:17] don't even notice them and and the holy
[1:22:19] spirit is just saying just pick one just
[1:22:21] pick two pick three pick them all and
[1:22:24] you don't even pick one because you
[1:22:25] don't know they're there
[1:22:27] see what is the true church what do we
[1:22:29] have access to i can tell you that
[1:22:32] everything of laodicea is designed to
[1:22:34] keep you from understanding that
[1:22:38] see
[1:22:39] and so his word alone can do this but
[1:22:42] there has to be some fervency
[1:22:44] because laodicea is geared to exhaust
[1:22:49] fervency in you
[1:22:50] amen it's geared to that
[1:22:53] it's geared to exhaust your fervency
[1:22:57] see
[1:22:58] and so you know tonight if i could
[1:23:00] accomplish anything as i just wind it up
[1:23:02] for tonight and i'm not still not
[1:23:04] anywhere close to finishing but
[1:23:07] i want you to
[1:23:09] think about this
[1:23:12] heavenly vault
[1:23:14] of treasure
[1:23:15] that you
[1:23:17] are offered
[1:23:18] access to
[1:23:21] you've been given
[1:23:23] the key
[1:23:24] to unlock a vault
[1:23:26] and this vault is filled with eternal
[1:23:30] life
[1:23:33] the other day
[1:23:35] i got to thinking about that
[1:23:37] and i thought
[1:23:38] wow have i have i ever just like stepped
[1:23:41] back and went whoa
[1:23:43] i have eternal life
[1:23:46] i have eternal life i have a term i have
[1:23:48] eternal life i have eternal life i have
[1:23:52] eternal life
[1:23:54] guess what
[1:23:56] i have eternal life did you know
[1:23:58] i have eternal life did you know i can
[1:24:00] never die
[1:24:04] do you really stop and think about what
[1:24:06] that means to us and to say to yourself
[1:24:08] i have eternal life
[1:24:10] when i when i kept saying that to myself
[1:24:12] i said
[1:24:14] nothing else even matters
[1:24:17] nothing else even matters troubles may
[1:24:20] come
[1:24:21] but i have eternal life
[1:24:24] oh hallelujah trials
[1:24:27] every kind of sickness every kind of
[1:24:30] trouble
[1:24:31] but i have eternal life
[1:24:33] oh sickness of every sort trials of
[1:24:36] every sort distresses of every sort may
[1:24:39] descend upon me but i have eternal life
[1:24:42] i might suffer earthly loss of
[1:24:44] unimaginable loss but it doesn't matter
[1:24:47] i have eternal life
[1:24:50] i win no matter what no matter what no
[1:24:52] matter what
[1:24:54] i have eternal life
[1:24:57] think about that friends
[1:24:59] when the enemy comes when trials come
[1:25:01] sickness comes loss comes distress comes
[1:25:04] troubles come just just back up and go
[1:25:08] i have eternal life
[1:25:13] what a privilege
[1:25:15] you know it's it's hard for mankind
[1:25:18] and i get it
[1:25:21] because mankind has had a
[1:25:24] you know his histories have went back
[1:25:25] thousands of years
[1:25:28] and his 6 000 years of histories
[1:25:32] have
[1:25:34] really almost made it impossible
[1:25:37] for him to imagine
[1:25:39] that somehow it's just coming to an
[1:25:41] abrupt end but it is
[1:25:45] because the
[1:25:47] the tendency is oh it'll just keep going
[1:25:49] why why do you think that well
[1:25:51] it always has
[1:25:53] it always will
[1:25:55] if something always has you'd tend to
[1:25:57] think it always will
[1:26:00] say well
[1:26:01] well what what about the end of your
[1:26:02] life what's next well i don't know but i
[1:26:04] know that you know i'm doing this for my
[1:26:06] children and children's children
[1:26:08] children because everybody has this and
[1:26:09] that's normal that's perfectly nothing
[1:26:11] wrong with thinking that
[1:26:12] because that's true it has went hundreds
[1:26:16] and then a thousand and then thousands
[1:26:19] and millennia and multiple millennials
[1:26:21] multiple times millennia and worst and
[1:26:24] mankind is still here
[1:26:26] and six thousand years of his histories
[1:26:28] has made it him almost in impossible for
[1:26:31] him to perceive
[1:26:33] that it's all just temporary and has to
[1:26:36] end it must end
[1:26:38] and that's what he's missing
[1:26:40] because the principle is remember
[1:26:43] the the principle is that whatever is
[1:26:46] not eternal must
[1:26:48] end amen it has to end
[1:26:52] that's the principle and people say yeah
[1:26:54] but the odds are and i get it the odds
[1:26:57] are that it'll just it'll go another 6
[1:27:00] 000 years but i'm here to tell you odds
[1:27:02] against a bible principle are no match
[1:27:06] i don't care what the odds are i don't
[1:27:08] care if you have failed at every
[1:27:10] spiritual test in your life if you've
[1:27:12] got a gene of god you're going in a
[1:27:14] rapture and there's nothing you can do
[1:27:15] to stop
[1:27:16] it the devil cannot defeat you even if
[1:27:20] it looks like it even if you go down and
[1:27:22] defeat your rise in victory
[1:27:24] because there is no defeat for god's
[1:27:26] family there is there now therefore no
[1:27:29] condemnation to them which are in christ
[1:27:33] we have the victory assured it's that's
[1:27:35] not that's never been my issue
[1:27:38] my whole issue tonight from sunday and
[1:27:40] tonight is i want to i want to have a
[1:27:42] fervent life i want to operate these
[1:27:44] divine principles i want to operate
[1:27:46] these these promises i want to see god
[1:27:49] alive in my life i want to make my life
[1:27:51] count i want to redeem my time while i'm
[1:27:53] here because it's limited
[1:27:56] see
[1:27:56] odds odds nothing i don't care about
[1:27:58] odds odds against the principle are no
[1:28:00] match
[1:28:02] for god's principle
[1:28:04] and that and that it's hard for man to
[1:28:06] understand that everything that's
[1:28:08] happened in all of his thousands of
[1:28:09] years of history is combined has all
[1:28:11] been god in perfect control
[1:28:15] with his
[1:28:16] plan and his purposes and his destinies
[1:28:20] and that's hard for people to get their
[1:28:21] mind around
[1:28:22] and the and the prophecy the reality is
[1:28:27] that at the end of the last new
[1:28:29] testament church age
[1:28:31] all the histories come to an abrupt end
[1:28:36] they finish
[1:28:38] they
[1:28:39] the earth waxes old the bible says and
[1:28:42] it's ready to be reborn
[1:28:44] into a millennium you know it i lucifer
[1:28:47] don't like to hear it
[1:28:49] and that's why i love saying it
[1:28:54] from the day he was created he was not
[1:28:56] an expression of god because then he'd
[1:28:58] be eternal
[1:29:00] he was created by god like hell was
[1:29:02] created for the devil and his angels not
[1:29:04] eternal so my brother said there's no
[1:29:05] eternal hell can't be because it was
[1:29:07] created it had a start had a start date
[1:29:10] and it has an expiration date
[1:29:13] known of god
[1:29:14] known of god hell has an expiration date
[1:29:17] on the calendar
[1:29:19] and every 24 hours it's taking 24 hours
[1:29:21] closer to it
[1:29:23] and lucifer
[1:29:26] sin
[1:29:28] everything
[1:29:30] unbelief
[1:29:31] all has an expiration date amen
[1:29:36] the devil comes around trying to
[1:29:38] threaten me
[1:29:39] brother eddie used to always it's so so
[1:29:41] funny
[1:29:42] when he him and sister jean lived in
[1:29:43] florida
[1:29:45] before they moved up here
[1:29:47] i think we were here what mom three
[1:29:49] years before y'all finally come in
[1:29:51] two or three years
[1:29:53] brother dad used to call me up
[1:29:56] and
[1:29:57] we all we had all been in north carolina
[1:29:58] so we knew beaufort had better weather
[1:30:00] than north carolina that's why we left
[1:30:02] there because you know five months of
[1:30:04] wintry gray skies and rain and trying to
[1:30:06] work in the mud
[1:30:09] but dad kept going south he ended up all
[1:30:10] the way in florida which had even better
[1:30:12] weather than here
