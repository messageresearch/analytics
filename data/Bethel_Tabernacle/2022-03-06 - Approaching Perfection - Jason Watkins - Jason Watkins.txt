for a moment amen just wanted to uh before we turned our scripture i just wanted to try to say something about last evening now i was thinking about this coming to church and i thought you know i really wouldn't know where to start which is a problem because then if i start i don't know where to stop and i'd end up taking all my ministry time to do it but i i realized that i would i would need all of my ministry time just to try to express to you what that meant to myself and my wife um i i truly have never been so surprised in my entire life and i spent a lot of time trying to think i try to think it's got to be a time that's equal to this and there has been no time in all my years that i have had an equal to that shock and surprise amen so i want to thank you i want to thank everybody who made that possible um you know it's you you want to say this person that person this person but really it's it's the whole family the whole bethel family and i i guess that's probably the greatest accomplishment um that if i i don't i don't feel like i have too many you know things that i can and just quietly sit and think wow i really got that right in 27 years of pastoring but one thing that the lord has allowed my wife and i to accomplish together and it took took us doing it together is we have fostered the whole feeling it's not just a thought cliche or a saying a motto it really is how we feel this is a family this whole church is a family amen and i i always wanted it that way i i remember even in the years when i thought i would never be a pastor and didn't want to ever be one but i thought if i ever was the last thing i would want i don't mean this to sound disparaging so just try to hear my heart when i say it i just always thought that if i ever was a pastor i i would not want to be a pastor of just a just another message church on the corner amen you know we we have plenty of that i thought you know i want it to be something that reflects my vision of a church and a family and camaraderie and all for one and one for all y'all ever heard me say that amen so it was really i mean it's this morning quite impossible to tell you how i feel about last night i know that it was also equally heartwarming to my family and to my mother to my children my grandchildren amen my grandchildren already think i'm the greatest human in the world but that really sealed the deal now they know you know amen amen you know they're they're they they don't hesitate to say mom dad you are great but papaw amen but i truly felt humbled and privileged all unworthy all just bawled up into one so i just want to say thank you on behalf of my self sister debbie and my entire family i want to say thank you amen i am trusting that the lord will amen allow us to all be live in the same neighborhood in glory amen brother dale i was talking to him this morning and and i said i said hey we're going to be next door neighbors best buds for all eternity he goes sorry pal i'll never be home i'm gonna i'm gonna be at the throne room constantly i said well i was meaning we'll be roommates in god's guest house and it must be a short stroll so amen but our our future is bright friends it's bright it's it's assured and it's steadfast and you can rely on it so god bless you for everyone um for all of those uh who we're not able to be i know we have a number of families who stream streaming now we want to say that we felt the love from near and far so god bless you let's stand back to our feet amen and i i want to invite you to uh the book of hebrews this morning amen so they gave me a coffee a coffee cup last night that said how does a pastor make coffee hebrews it amen praise the lord amen i thought whoever whoever found that cup for sister debbie that was that was amazing that was spot on amen amen so praise the lord i um oh you're gonna bug me already okay let me see here what do i need to do um okay let me move this i'm getting fussed at amen okay that's about as there we go a little bit more amen hope that's better and that's a little closer i don't know that how much i don't think i got it quite where you're asking but that seems to be about as far as i can get it you hear me all right amen i think they're more concerned about the broadcast and i am too we like to make sure that that has a really good sound um so i'll just hey once i get going you'll wish i'd have moved it away amen so praise the lord um hebrews chapter 6 and we're just going to catch thanks hebrews chapter 6 we're going to catch paul coming now to this subject of he's carrying on with this subject of melchizedek i should rather say and he picks up in the 17th verse and we'll read down through the end of of chapter 6 and we'll go a few into chapter 7. so chapter 6 verse 17 wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation so by two things first that he said it secondly that he can't lie all right right so it's uh it's a double confirmation um that we might have strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us now i just want to say that that that's god looking out for you in this impossible age because when it comes to melchizedek his whole existence is most poignant most important most forward right now amen as brother branham talks about a greater than solomon is here actually paul is going to to begin to show that under the new covenant of christ that it really is it's greater than melchizedek because melchizedek is going to become jesus christ and if that wasn't going to be greater why become it you see so every time it's going forward it's going to be greater all right all right now let's carry on which hope verse 19 we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made an high priest forever after the order of melchizedek for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace and that beautiful without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor ending of life but made like unto the son of god abideth the priest continually now that's important because when you understand the application of melchizedek as it relates to you amen remember jesus melchizedek became jesus christ jesus christ became mrs jesus christ you follow me so as it relates to you and i it's extremely important that you realize you're in this verse without father without mother without beginning of days without ending of life amen that's the ministry and it fits you and only you because you began in the mind of god so you see the significance all right let's pray father we thank you for your word now we ask your blessing to be upon it we commit ourselves into your hands in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated we would just like to make a quick note to you concerning the saints in ukraine we have been actively sending everything that comes in straight over we're using brother barry coffee's established pipeline there's no need to reinvent the wheel his is working and it's pretty much a miracle that it's working but it is and we've already received reports back from the believers that they're receiving what we're sending and what other churches are sending and uh it's it's their their gratitude is is thick and so i just wanted to pass that along to you we still have not a single report of any believer suffering casualties or even an injury even an injury amen and so we're we're we're just continuing to pray for them and they're still um they're still holding services and they're still holding prayer meetings and even with shells falling amen so we thank the lord for his saving grace and his protection amen praise the lord and then um i also would like to note that we were going to have today a fundraiser update uh brother ken boos who is heading up our fundraiser project for our renovations was scheduled to give a brief report today and uh but he the enemy attacked him all week he's been pretty sick and so he let me know this morning he was up a long time he's got a bad cough and he sounded terrible last night trying to talk to him so he wouldn't have had the voice for it at any rate but we want to be praying for him uh that he makes a full recovery and then um sister luna also what they think maybe uh she ate some something before coming i said well no one else he said no she ate taco bell before coming i said oh no the taco bug taco bell bugs so so anyway poor little sister she was throwing up throughout the night and her belly hurt and i can't hardly understand that you know and to see children sick like that but but amen i appreciate your prayers and she got some sleep off and on michael and sister phyllis got some sleep off and on uh so just keep them in prayer today would you please i told her i told them both sister phyllis amber the michael i said when she wakes up you make sure you tell her brother jason sister debbie and the whole church are praying for her amen so amen and i know that uh what's the report then uh brother sister joy uh the baby everything was all right bradley yeah okay yeah i know yeah so but all is well so far yeah praise the lord amen this is a time of year my i've got a um oh boy she'd be the child of a of a niece of mine and they had to take her to the hospital up in north carolina with rsv rsv or whatever they call that respiratory problems and so we're praying for that as well amen now let me get straight into my sermon today and i wish to take a title called approaching perfection and maybe if they can give me my power powerpoint brother caleb thank you kindly and i guess i'm going to fire it from here amen let's see if i'm um uh working here yep perfect so we're gonna get into that all right we'll leave it there for just a moment approaching perfection and we're dealing with the subtitle the final days of the omega bride is that you now it's interesting here in our text reading because we we find out that paul had previously right in the fifth chapter of hebrews before coming to what we read in our text this morning he actually goes and begins to try to condition their mind uh he's gonna take that whole fifth chapter and show them how that god was you know how that god himself was willing to lower himself uh down to become a temptable man uh so that he could feel what we feel so that he would be a faithful high priest to know your struggles so you don't have to explain what it's like to be you know a human under the temptation of the enemy and under the trials and tribulations of life and under stress and tiredness and sickness and anxiety jesus knows firsthand what that feels like and so paul is trying to get the church in that fifth chapter to understand that you know if there if there ever was a reason to not lose hope or to not give up that that that's the reason that we have a faithful high priest and so don't don't let yourself be discouraged the bible even says that you know if things get really too thick and too hot and hard and heavy you start to feel down you start to feel like life's unfair the apostles said look just consider jesus who suffered such a contradiction against of sinners against himself he was innocent and we were guilty and yet god swapped you swapped him for you that's that blows my mind that god traded the innocent for the guilty see and so so he is here we realize that you know he knows what i'm going through and this was paul's great burden that the hebrew nation understand that he knows what we're going through that he understands you want to know today and i can say for me and i can say it's true for you he understands my frustrations he understands your frustrations at least half of which we bring on ourself amen he understands i want you to know that he knows what we are going through and he's here to help he's here to help me he's here to help you he's not here to destroy us as satan would have us believe sometimes preaching can get pretty rough sometimes it can get what brother branham would call gun barrel straight and you know it can seem at times you know where it's it's really coming down hard but just always remember he's not here to destroy you that's what satan would have you believe satan does that to get you to feel like giving up yes amen i'm here to tell you friends we live in a real world and you're a real person and there's no sense coming here and painting ourselves as if we're the perfect people who never have a problem who never make a stumble nonsense we just throw that stuff out we're all just we're all just we're all just a bunch of no goods who god loved amen and somehow even while i was a sinner he loved me amen and so i i just throw that back in the face of the enemy when he tries to remind me of my failures i just remind him that god already knew my failures that i would make before i made them before i was born before before anything god already knew and christ died for me anyway so now brother branham begins to talk about this uh priesthood this this melchizedek um and he's going to deal with the claims that some say this some say is merely a priesthood some say he wasn't a real man it's hard to believe but people can actually believe that he he just uh i i heard our biggest our biggest mega church in this town and that doctor of divinity with more letters behind his name than some of our names and he said no he was just a normal man lived and died i'm like why do you not believe the bible i mean when i read the bible don't come telling me he was a normal man who lived and died i'm reading in a bible that he had no beginning of days nor ending of life and abideth continually see so brother branham goes on here and who is this melchizedek one of the schools are claims he's just a myth he wasn't actually a person and others say it was a priesthood that was the mount that was the melchizedek priesthood that's the most likely one they hold better to that side than they do the other is because they say it was a priesthood it can't be that for in the fourth verse it says he was a person a man so in order to be a person he has to be a personality a man not an order but a person so he was not just a priesthood order see so he was not just a priesthood order neither was he a myth he was a person you're getting it all right you're following now watch and the eternal and the person is eternal if you notice he had no father he had no mother he had no time he ever began he had no time he ever ended and whoever it was is still alive tonight because the bible said here that he had neither father or mother beginning of days or ending of life so it would have to be an eternal person is that right an eternal person so it could only be one person that's god because he's the only one that's eternal all right you agree with that i'm sure you agree with that see all right now and now the thing that i contend is that he was god because he's the only person that can be immortal and now god changing himself into a person and that's what he was no father no mother no beginning of life no ending of days the whole bible is the revelation of god the whole church is built upon the revelation of god there's no other way to know god only by revelation to whom the son will reveal him revelation everything is revelation so to not accept the revelation then you're just a cold theologian and there is no hope for you now could there be anything sadder than that you know it's one thing if you were tomorrow to have a doctor say to you you have a terminal illness and i'm sorry to say there's no hope for you that would be bad enough but to actually have a prophet tell you that there is no hope for you now you have to understand if you go to listen to the tape brother branham is relating a story about a he was in a in a conversation with a man who's a minister and you know he was arguing with brother branham and said you know it's revelation and the man said i can't receive revelation i got to be able to read it exactly in the text and i can't i can't rely on revelation and brother branham says well then you cut yourself off from god see because if you can only read what's on the line but you have no revelation for what's between the line then you're just a cold theologian all you've got is head knowledge see and so so we realize that brother branham if you listen to him on the tape he's not reveling in that it and we should not revel in that it was a sad resignation in his heart as he's telling the story so because he's trying to help the man who he was speaking to nonetheless this is true both in a principle and application because because when you refuse you know you because if you find yourself where you become satisfied to just merely be filled with knowledge but but you never come to a real changing power in your life that's a sad state see and this is this is what a cold theologian is you you've memorized a lot of bible you know it by heart you can quote it forwards and backwards you understand great mysteries but you've never really felt what it feels like to have the power of god come into your heart and change your whole nature away from the world and turn you toward god's righteousness see and this happens because refusing to allow the spirit to reveal himself further to you you you you never become different you only generally become more religious you start going to a church you you know you stop lying you start going to church you you know little things like that that's all good that's all fine you need to stop lying you need to stop stealing let him that stealeth steal no more says the bible and so you know you need to follow the dictates of of holiness but as as old mace jackson used to say sitting in a church won't make you a christian any more than sitting in a a garage would make you an automobile oh brother mays and and and so we find then that that what that what happens the end result is that you can go many many years accumulating doctrinal knowledge but yet you you're never really able to see you're never really able to see your life threaded into the life of god you know there's not that blending and you know it's not there you know what you know what you believe mentally but you but you when you close your eyes at night you know that somehow it's not stitched into the fabric of of your psyche of who you are it's not really having an impact or a directional uh efficacy on your personal life it's not really ever changed your desires you don't want to go to hell of course you don't who does you don't want to miss a rapture nobody who hears about it would want to miss it but but it's got to go further than that and this is what the ministry of melchizedek is here to accomplish because that was god living in a mortal man and so we realized then that he later brother branham says he he's alive today he said whoever he was he's alive tonight and yet brother branham would say that we don't hear no more about him because he became something different say well wait a minute i thought he's still alive tonight he is but he he in morphed himself and became jesus christ god as brother ram said jesus christ god changing himself into a person see so now then you realize that was he done there no that was not the end of god's plan that's not what melchizedek was showing oh my melchizedek was showing that there's going to be a whole kingdom of people who are the word living as a human being that the word is now made flesh in their lives and that's that's why he abideth forever he's he'll he never has a beginning of days he never has an ending of life he just kept changing stations kept changing manifestations he was in the nazarene who walked the shores of galilee but god was never planning to stay bottled up in one human walking the shores of galilee jesus even said except the corn of wheat died abideth alone and the whole plan of redemption was so he wouldn't abide alone that's the reason the whole thing started he didn't want to abide alone he wanted to be a family and this now this brings the order of melchizedek upon your life when you're born again of the spirit of god see so you know it's it's it's it's your life you realize that your life we talk about an unfolding mystery of god in our day but i i i'm going to show you paul's words in the book of ephesians and i'm going to give you a clue what you're looking for all right because i'm i'm not here to tell you neither was paul merely interested in in this unfolding mystery of god just be data to you amen right because he's actually going to show you that this mystery wants fellowship with you so it's not data it's not just knowledge it's a person and he's unfolding himself and that's why the world is unaware of who he is and what it takes to please him because they don't even realize he's living in a body in the earth right now see so paul desired you to become a part of the mystery watch ephesians 3 very wonderful ephesians is not really um a book paul's not really teaching a lot of doctrine it's it's a really a book to encourage the church here at ephesus to really show them who they're who they are in their position that is in christ a little bit different from the book of corinthians in that regard paul says how that by revelation he made he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote a four and a few in a few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ what's this all about paul what's this mystery of mystery of christ what are you talking about which in other ages so it's something that in other ages was not made known so it's a something to be made known and in other ages it was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit see by revelation of the spirit what is it can you can you give us a clue here it is that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel the jews never imagined that happening whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of great the the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent for the purpose that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god watch now all right let me let me stop right there before i go to that quote now the manifold wisdom of god if paul would go on to say that what is this great mystery it's christ in you that's the hope that's the purpose that's the reason that's what melchizedek is showing and that's why brother branham that's that's why when when nicodemus comes to jesus at night and he says now we know you have to be of god the counsel knows because no one can do what you're doing except he be of god because you see they had not seen that level of the word made flesh since the days of abraham when he met melchizedek and the king of salem who was the priest of the most high god when abraham met him and they and they and their and he discerned the thoughts in in the in the heart of sarah behind him now it's not to say prophets hadn't come that discerned people's thinking that's not what it's just saying it's not saying you know there's this miracle of discernment but what it's saying is we've never seen that combined in such a way that literally the promise of god is living behind human skin and we we know that you have to be because this is exactly what our father abraham saw and your your evidence that that was true and you must be true well i'm here to tell you something today that's why brother branham would constantly go and pull that forward and he'd come to saint john 4 every time in a prayer line here a man and a woman and he starts discerning her heart what is he doing what's happening what is brother branham trying to get the people to understand in this hour that the purpose of what we see in melchizedek which was seen in jesus christ must be seen in within us you must see god in you you must see it amen you must see that you must see that prophecy cannot fail see now watch now i'm going to go on with brother branham all right watch and that's what god did it's the same god all the time god in the form of the father the spirit the pillar of fire see the same god was made flesh and blood among us in morphe brought out so he could be seen and now that same god is the holy ghost and that simple he moves on notice like the sculpture he hides with a mask over it that's what god has done to this age it's been hid all these things has been hid and it's supposed to be revealed in this age now the bible says they will be revealed in the latter times it's like a sculptor keeping his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it and off of it and there it is all right now that's what the bible has been it's been a work of god that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world and its seven-fold mystery and god promised i'll tell you something friends you don't get this in the average american pulpit on a sunday morning this is this is almost completely unintelligible to them they're like huh what wait what but to us we read this and we realize our portion in it because we've been taught these things and we realize my goodness i am actually part of the of god's godhead i'm actually part of the family of god i'm actually here and my whole life has a purpose behind it i'm not just here i'm not just trying to be a better human i've actually got a greater i've got a greater heritage than that see that's what the devil don't want you to know see but knowing this is what helps you to persevere and to keep pressing and i'll press today and i'll press tomorrow and i'll press the next day and nothing is going to stop me from pressing because i understand this that's where your strength lies see it's been a work of god it's been covered up all right what a glorious he would uh and and god promised in the last day at the age of the laodicean church he would oh i was thinking like it said let me see here and god prophesy at the age of this latest in church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing all right last one here now god in morphe ma masked in the pillar of fire brother brown said like a stage actor he's got the same actor who goes backstage and changes his outfit he comes out as a different character but it's the same person see god in more faith and a man called jesus you believe that you believe that god in morphe was in a man called jesus does that give you hope and courage does that give you power over the devil when you say in the name of jesus because you know what you're talking about all right read on and what god in morphe in a man called jesus god in morphe in his church god above us god with us god in us what is it it's the condescending of god that's what we're a part of here today that's why this is not just a social gospel that's why this is not just legalism do's and don'ts you can't join this church it's a body you have to be born into it see and then there's power within that family see so now we realize that he's he's living in his body uh in the earth is this one the one that yeah perfect so he's living in his body in the earth friends the the exact same god just in a different form and in a different position because while the bride while christ means the anointed word so that's in that way brother branham would say so jeremiah was christ this is why jesus was christ and this is why christ exists in the body the bride is the word made flesh again in the earth see what's the difference between me as christ and him as christ he's both lord and christ so it's it's it's just it's just a different form of the same god with a different position paul could see it all clearly and he he so desired to impart that to the church but the church in paul's day became relaxed and dull of hearing and that's what paul goes on in that fifth chapter to say now i i really got a lot to say to you about melchizedek but but it's hard to s it's hard to say because you're dull of hearing see it's it's difficult on me i thought i had that verse um [Music] i thought i did thought i did thought i did um yes of whom we have hebrews 5 11 of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing i get that as a preacher you know when you're when you just feel like you're just it's just going over everybody's head and and when you feel like when you when you're trying to preach the power of the kingdom of god and everybody's just starting to backslide and live carnal and this is what paul was facing the church was relaxing unbelievers and make believers were infiltrating the congregations i mean there i go i know that brother branham said you know every group has three kinds of believers in it but even that statement has to be qualified because there certainly weren't three kinds of believers in the upper room when 120 got the holy ghost all 120 of them were solid believers and 120 of them got born again now a little while later you see ananias and sapphira coming in mingling in you know like i said to you before and today it's it's hard on us because churches are everywhere and denominations are in the thousands there's more than 30 000 different denominations and independent movements that actually have a charter but but in but in the days of the apostle paul every church was a message church there was only one gospel one lord one faith amen one baptism one god father above all who is it all amen so so we realize that that the church began to slip away and paul could see all of this clearly in melchizedek but as the church began to slip away that that that they were never able paul kept talking about this vision how that he's he's trying to get that church there that alpha church to say now listen this is all going to culminate in a body change you know we that the dead in christ shall rise everybody's like really when soon and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up we'll be changed how fast in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and we'll ever be with the lord now it just sounds like oh my he's just going to be here next week but that church started to slip away that church started to backslide and and and they failed to keep going but i'm here to tell you that this message this is precisely what has been brought back to us everything paul was trying to get them to come to and you the omega bride have been called back to this glorious truth to do what to fulfill that word a body change it must be it has to be see no matter it doesn't matter what your eyes see about you your eyes your eyes can look sometimes people's let their eyes look at their neighbor and go he's never going to make it and what you are too prideful to admit i heard brother jd talk about pride this morning what you're too prideful is me to admit is you lay in your bed at night and think you're not either i've always said show me an overly suspicious person i'll show you a dishonest one because they expect everybody to be like them see and oh everybody must be liars that's because you're one and you think everybody else is see and i you can't believe how many times i've seen people get so mad lose their cool lose their temper get irritated grieve the holy spirit and and the whole thing that they try to pass it off onto is righteous indignation because they see oh that sister her skirt or that young man or that married couple or this person and really really too often times i'm sad to say i found that it's really because the person wanted to do it themselves but they were too afraid to go to hell so they wouldn't do it themselves but they craved it and they were jealous that that person could do it and they wanted to do it but they didn't want to be seen doing it oh come on friends oh we're all just a bunch of no goods we're here by the grace of god oh my and so i'm here to tell you that this prophecy will come to pass it doesn't matter what you see even within yourself listen abraham didn't see a whole lot when melchizedek comes and makes the promise to him he didn't see a whole lot he had to go 25 years going in the opposite direction aging out getting older getting further away from possibilities sarah the same way i mean she couldn't even have children when she was a young woman and now she's only getting further from it how's it and abraham just knew it's going to be a greater miracle you know and and so he didn't see a sign of it but his change was underway her change was underway there wasn't one sign they could look at but it was happening i don't always see it i don't know how i'm gonna make it i just have to say like john what love is this i don't even know what i am but here's what i know when he appears i will be like him because i'm believing his word and his word is changing me hallelujah the trumpet will sound and we will be changed and what seems obscure to us will be made plain as the bible says we shall know as we are known amen we'll go from what brother branham used he put two terms together and called it partial realization you know as opposed to perfect realization which was really just the uh all it does is express his perfect realization as an idea as contrasted with partial realization so so in in john jesus said in john uh 6 i don't think i have any of this no i didn't but let me just quote it to you he said in in john 6 32 moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven so moses was saying that or jesus was saying that bread i'm not saying moses didn't give you a bread i'm not even saying it didn't come down his angels food from heaven what he under jesus was saying what i'm trying to get you to understand is that was only a partial type of what i am in perfection you see hebrews 9 24 for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself not to appear in the presence of god so moses built a tabernacle in the wilderness solomon built a temple for him but that was only partial realization even though the spirit of god came down and lived in it and spoke to him from the tabernacle of the congregation and the shekinah was there for real and i mean it blessed people and people who defied it and killed them and and it caused a rod to bud that was just an old dry stick so it was for real it wasn't just a metaphor that temple that tabernacle was real but it was partial compared to jesus when he came he was the perfect realization of all of that you see so even in first corinthians these are examples brother branham uses for now we see through a glass darkly paul says in first corinthians 13 but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and so so what we find then is brother branham tells us in the church in the church age book he says partial realization will be made perfect realizations making sure i didn't have that on the slides he says partial realization will be made perfect realization in other words completed realization hallelujah we we have been looking through a glass darkly but soon it will be face to face a prophet picking up first corinthians 13 12 and saying that's a scripture for this hour that we have been looking at the church in a partial realization we've seen the holy spirit come into the church we've seen the power to heal the sick and raise the dead we've seen the power to discern the unbelievers we've seen all of that but there's coming an hour where it's not just something that will be a partial thing that we see occasionally what it's going to become is an every moment reality when a bride stands in a perfect body with the perfect word in her mouth this is exactly the vitamins and nutrients of the word that god is trying to get to you that satan is trying every way he can to distract you from see so he says we have been going forward we we have been going from glory to glory but soon it will be right in the glory and in his glory will shine we shall be like him wondrously like him here's a beautiful promise one day we will be changed in the atoms we will put on immortality you believe that we'll be swallowed up in life see this is what happened in the days of john coming as john the baptist is coming as elijah and the bible said that that the bible talks about this prophecy of christ coming i believe in hosea uh that might stand correction i think it is but he says the one you're looking for will suddenly come to his temple and i mean you know here's all these believers following john and they're just going to church oh it's church john john's preaching at the river today come on honey get up get the kids ready let's go just like you did just went to church they've been going for a while he's been he's been preaching for six months we've got a new pastor john the baptist we go down to the river and hear him every day er er er er sabbath oh i wonder what he's going to preach on today the kingdom of god oh what else money preached on we need to repent okay but what next well the kingdom of god okay but besides that we need to repent yeah i get that but what else is he preaching on prepare the way the kingdom of god is at hand repent get ready and one day said what happened to you well one day we got up fixed my coffee we fixed breakfast we went to church i had to get some gas we bought we rolled up to the river got out walked up and stood in the crowd and john took a different text there wasn't no words going on with our pastor and he said the one i've been telling you about is standing among you right now i'm like wait wait what what is he even saying and it wasn't even very long he goes there he is there he is the one who you expect will suddenly come to his temple i'm here to tell you it'll be just like that friends one of these mornings are going to come on a sunday morning and i'm going to say there he is he's here we're going home hallelujah oh my he will suddenly appear see that's that's exactly when you go back to abraham i mean once that ministry of melchizedek came on the scene the change came on quickly see it was just it's really just a one more year i think after that he said this time next year about the time of life she's gonna conceive and and you know something that deliverance you're talking about shall suddenly appear she overnight the change came overnight there was hardly one sign of anything all they had was their faith and all abraham and sarah could do every time they went to church was claim the promise all they could do is keep claiming the promise and keep claiming the promise and they had bills to pay and they had you know servants and a headquarters and a home and and and and here he had he had one child and and he's and he's got all these complications everybody's got a promise just like you and i we got families and we got jobs and we got careers and we got church and we got this and that and we buy groceries and go out to eat but i'm here to tell you that that change came overnight they went to bed old and woke up young no wonder a prophet said it'll come like between six and nine in the morning oh let it be right away oh god i'll go to bed hurting and achy and tired wake up new hallelujah oh my we're in the days of abraham all over again see in his presence friends that's when we see ourselves as he does that's the secret of surviving in this discouraging tiring draining day is to steal away into his presence because it was in his presence that's when god added deity to his name to his wife's name added an h and he goes from abram to abraham she goes from sarai to sarah and god adds an h because an h in the old testament stands for deity and god comes in and in that presence they're they're beginning to understand who they are that they are literally the promise that's going to come to pass because that's where we see ourselves as he does this is exactly why no one is going to cry cry foul as i've said to you before no one's going to cry foul at the judgment bar because in his presence they will know themselves as he does see putin's going to know that one day american politics are going to know that one day popes are going to know that one of these days when they stand in his presence they'll know exactly who they are because when you're in his presence that's why nobody's crying foul that's why nobody's crying unfair injustice nobody's marching and holding up signs at that trial there's no protesters outside because everybody knows i'm busted you can't come in his presence i want to tell you something friends get into his presence constantly constantly let that be your every day get into his presence because in his presence it's when he can really show you who you are where you are and what you need see and so we find then that when you know when he descended in our day that's what came to us we came into his presence and he washed us with the bleeding word and and now we see ourselves as he does see and and that's where your victory renews itself every day is seeing yourself as he sees you but when you when you go long periods of time and you're not in his presence you're going to get very discouraged very discouraged brother branham talks about how that our scientists tell us it's three minutes to midnight you know they've been saying that for a long time brother branham said it's it's long ago we were three minutes to midnight but we know this is an amazing statement he says but we know the hand of god has stopped time to wait just long-suffering like he was in the days of noah see so so you you know when you when you track it back you can see that god has been causing time to move at the space at the pace of prophecy see now i've taught on this before and i'm not going to take a lot of time and get bogged down here but when we study the trumpets you realize that everything was running at a certain pace until you get to the fifth trumpet and in the fifth trumpet a star falls from heaven that brother branham attaches to isaiah and says it's lucifer however they're fallen from heaven o lucifer's son of the morning and so that star that falls from heaven has got a key to the bottomless pit and he opens a bottomless pit now what is this what is this illustrating it's illustrating that there everything had been running at a certain pace but now it's time to pick up the pace and he's given this angel the keys to the bottomless pit so he can kind of let's get on with this we need to increase the tempo you know you got you got you got a drummer playing at a certain tempo you say hey speed it up and that's exactly what happened and and what does he do he releases the the the has the key to the bottomless pit he's been given an extra little bit of power extra little bit of authority that he never enjoyed in the earth and what's why why why because the first was coming it's right around the turn of the century and and if you'll notice because the bible says that when the enemy comes in like a flood he raises up a standard so as soon as he gives lucifer a little extra power to go and un unlock the bottomless pit and release these demons he he grabs a hold of parnum and grant and all these guys and daddy seymour and he starts the azusa revival see because when this when the enemy comes like a flood god raises up a standard so god's keeping this thing balanced oh my god he's keeping this thing balanced friends because what did it do and that that ran all the way till it ran the first woe out in the and the first wall would have just kept going first of all the second third woe but what did he do he stopped time he's throttled it he's got his hand on a governor and he's saying okay we need a little prophecy we need a little movement okay let's go look okay stop stop stop stop okay let's go let's go okay stop stop stop stop and that's why you see the history and the way you do suddenly the whole world is a big conflagration and the whole world goes to war over nothing over nothing uh uh you know here's a leader of austria gets assassinated as if leaders don't get assassinated and next thing it starts as a world war are you kidding and you you've even got you've even got king george and you've got kaiser wilhelm and you've got nicholas in russia and you've you've got the the french king and they're all they're all cousins they're all related and they're all writing each other letters and and and you know they're they're writing now george we don't want to fight oh oh come on we'll willy willy we don't mama don't want us to fight come on call your armies oh yeah no problem and somebody somebody write to nikki and ask nikki to stand down and and we'll everything will be good and you know what when you've got the whole leaders and the kings and the czars and everybody trying to stop it and nobody can stop it over one assassination and you think history's an accident i'm here to tell you it's driven by prophecy and now what are you living in you're living in an accelerated time under the lasting effects of the second woe which are going to run all the way into the tribulation period and you're finding that's why there's been no cessation of global war since the end of world war ii i mean they're those men in iwo jima were just a few years later fighting in korea and their sons fighting in vietnam and their sons fighting in the persian gulf and their sons fighting in afghanistan and now you got ukraine i mean you've got bosnia you've got all these things it's never going to be peace now because why the third woe cometh quickly hallelujah and god has his hand modulating it god has his hand on the throttle governor it speeds up it slows down it speeds up it slows down why because god has been preparing a bride out of this day to take a flight home and i'm here to tell you it's coming on time it's not going to be one day late the rapture is coming exactly when it needs to come absolutely that's what you see happening in ukraine listen friends i'm here to tell you i can tell you the future and i'm not a prophet don't need to be see i i can look at prophecy just like just like when kobe first hit i said hey let's not live in fear because there'll be five more behind that one ten more behind those that's what we've seen the world's ending the the world order not the planet the world order i've said to you man's six thousand year run his six thousand year run in a falling condition is coming to an end god's restoring us to eden we're going back friends just as sure as anything it can't stop it and i i mean i don't know i i have no prophecy or quotes to tell you the outcome of what's going to happen in ukraine but that that that's that's and i don't mean to minimalize it but i'm i'm here to tell you there's a much larger picture going on you know what you know what you know what putin is finding out right now you can't fight the beast and i've been watching the headlines and i've been reading very very closely and constantly they're making these statements about this this cooperation between western powers and even even now even baltic states and and even nato and non-nato countries are starting to go yeah yeah come on you know cut off their money pinch them bring sanctions and it's not just sanctions i mean they had sanctions on korean sanctions in 2014. just little just little bad boy vladimir shame on you give back crimea no okay whatever but now see it's not about fighting with armies the bible tells us in revelation chapter 13 our chapter that that it is this beast that gives power to the image you understand nobody can defeat that dragon and you know what's happening you know what you know what's actually happening russia is learning that that eventually it's going to get now it can't get there yet because we're still here so it can't come to its fullness but he's learning that you can't buy or sell except you agree with the beast unless you're willing to work with the beast system unless you're really willing to work and take a mark on your forehead or your hand and either agree with us or work or work with us then guess what you're not going to buy or sell and oh my they're trying to change their currency to the gold standard and try to stabilize the ruble against the dollar and they're trying to make deals with china and deals with north korea it ain't going to matter i'm here to tell you china's going to find out also north korea is going to find out also the radical islam is going to find out also you can't fight this be system it rules the world and how does it do it through commerce through craft through business hallelujah friends these things aren't an accident ain't because somebody had a good idea we better get all together and so at the end time russia might go crazy we better have something to do this is all god with his hand on prophecy this is all god he sent a prophet exactly on time he say i wish he'd have found me when he found you exactly when he needed to find you i wish this that it never happened god knew exactly what needed to happen in your life and i'm here to tell you melchizedek that that priesthood that baptism of the holy ghost that continuation of god moving in the earth it's coming to its climax that's what's going to happen i don't even know they might finish out the war and annihilate ukraine and take over the government they start threatening to even dissolve them as a state dissolve their statehood and it's become greater russia i don't know i have no prophecy or quotes to tell you that i know how this is going to end they're trying to negotiate a peace settlement right now i don't know but what i can tell you is this russia is finding out and china's finding out and north korea is going to find out and the radical islam is going to find out that the beast is controlling the world and the only one controlling the beast is the same one who'll wrap a chain around that dude for a thousand years and cast him into a pit of circumstance and he'll have no power oh for a thousand years he'll have no power nobody to work through why because god was in control all the time and that's the one i serve that's whose kingdom i'm in that's what i've given my life to [Music] i'm not interested in the world i don't care i don't want it it's going to ash and cinder i'm here to serve his majesty the king i'm here to be a part of a kingdom that can never pass away oh let's stand friends i this is a glorious hour this is a promise that we've waited on for years and and the and the church has waited for thousands of years and we've arrived how many believe we have arrived at it amen i believe certainly that we have arrived at it come amen uh brother anthony and let's sing praise god oh friends my what an hour that we live in what a time the world listen the world is sinking into greater and greater darkness see and it can't get any better the the noose is tightening around their neck the beast subjugates the king of the north that's that's right here the beast that dragon that that beast system that's a power that antichrist power in the bible subjugates the king of the north puts him to heal that's why the king of the north hates the and will burn her with atomic fire brother branham said thus saith the lord russia will drop a bomb on the vatican [Music] i'm not going to be here hallelujah say oh what about when we can't buy or sell brother branham said the bride does not see that by the time he takes full authority over that the bride is at a thousand oh she's had a millennial she's at a wedding suffer a table thousands of miles long and and while the world while mankind just destroys himself and brings himself to nothing and then christ returns i just say antichrist you can have it have my home have my car have my land have everything i'll be back in 42 months to get it you can have it for a while i'll be back to get it go ahead have at it live in it i don't care burn it down whatever i'm going to build it all back anyway hallelujah that's the reality that we're living in friends that's why we preach that's why we sing that's why we worship that's why we're here that's why we're believers oh what a privilege what a privileged people that we are why don't you bow your heads with me [Music] and let me just talk to the lord a minute make sure i'm clear i stopped quite early in my notes father oh we love you today lord we love you raise up our hands to your lord we sing praises unto you lord god and father i just it felt like a little piece in my heart there that that i could just stop and we'll we'll have another portion of this for a later time i believe you're fine with it lord it feels like peace in my heart lord now would you come and just receive some praise would you receive glory from this bride who loves you this family of god who lord we're so grateful that you called us oh you didn't have to call us you oh you didn't have to open my eyes oh father as brother lineal wrote you didn't have to open my eyes you could have easily passed me by the age i was living in was wretched poor and blind but then i heard recognizing your day i heard serpent seed in perfect faith i heard the breach and the message of grace lord i thank you i thank you in this hour lord god i thank you for your word i thank you for these people let it be real to us lord let it put strength in our heart let these young people realize what a privileged station that they live in oh god it's impossible for them to do it even if they'd want to appreciate it to that level you have to do it so lord i'm asking you to come with your presence and your anointing lord let that young person know that you're including them as well that you love them you saw them before the foundation of the world you birthed them lord into the world for this very reason to be a believer to be to be a part something separate from the world i pray you will grant that to us today lord let sinners come to repentance lord let the make-believer come to him his senses and give his heart to god let let backsliders lord come back oh god and let the bride of christ march forward to full authority and power in the holy ghost father we pray for our precious saints and friends and and on both sides of that border lord and father ukrainians under attack and lord if you have any if if any of your servants have been conscripted into the russian forces and are being forced father to fight father keep watch over their lives and don't let them uh father just just just protect the whole thing on both sides bring about your glory and all of it lord keep camaraderie and brotherhood among all the all of our slavic friends lord god lord we love them i have so much time invested in those lands it's hard for me you know it's hard for me to see those cities pop marked and blown up and cars burnt and windows smashed and buildings on fire and see those ukrainian people walking in the streets lord i walk those very streets where i'm looking at these pictures lord i pray for them oh god i pray for those pastors such sincere men i met and last time i was there lord they came all the way into moscow to be at the meetings they couldn't do that today lord i pray father their last thing was asking me to please come back if i could just come back and hold meetings again it would be so helpful lord you never gave me the green light i don't know maybe somehow lord i just have to commit it all to you lord we just committed we're just praying for them we're trying to help them in every way we can teach us how lord that you want us to help and what our part should be we love you today love you for these people lord this has been a banner weekend it'd be certainly last night was such a hallmark for me lord my wife and i'll never forget the kindness and the genuine feeling that we could feel coming from these people you know how difficult it was for me to sit there and hear the accolades lord when i feel so unworthy of it and so under achieving lord and but father i at the same time i just look and say jesus led me all the way that's all i know lord i've just tried to put my hand in the hand of god and walk i didn't always have to know where i was going as long as i could feel that my hand was in yours may it ever be lord may it ever be in all of our lives we don't know how much how many days there remaineth yet for us to be here we know it's not many we know that your hand is on the governor lord your hand is on the throttle you're speeding it up slowing it down according to prophecy

ever before more sharply than ever we know that it must be your hand i pray lord you'll stir the hearts of your children stir the hearts of the unbelievers stir the hearts of the backslider lord don't someday it'll be too late someday they'll wish they could come into this building and hear a crazy man wave his hands and jump around and scream they'll long for the day oh if i could just have that back one more time lord they might not ever get that opportunity again don't let them pass it i pray father if there's any heart in here who's never known you in the power of your resurrection willing to enter with you into the fellowship of your sufferings willing to be made conformable even unto your death that's been my greatest desire lord ever since i started reading the bible that i may know him that i may know him that i may know him i can hardly read those words or quote them i can feel paul's earnest feeling in his heart that i may know him is there anything more important nothing lord nothing i'm sorry father if many times it appears that that that's the least important thing to me i don't mean ever mean for that to be it's the most important thing that i may know him in the power of his resurrection grant it to me lord help us to be more prepared today than we were yesterday we committed to you in jesus name amen sing for us this is the evening time it's later later than you
