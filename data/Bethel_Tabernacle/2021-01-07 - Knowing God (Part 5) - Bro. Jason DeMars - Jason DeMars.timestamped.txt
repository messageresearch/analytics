[30:23] we ask it in jesus name amen
[30:27] amen you can be seated for a moment
[30:31] just want to make sure they have my
[30:33] powerpoint back there
[30:34] went to the email
[30:38] of course i'm sure everyone saw has seen
[30:41] what's going on in the
[30:42] capital
[30:45] of our country today and
[30:49] i don't comment on current events too
[30:52] much
[30:53] but i'll just say this that
[30:57] regardless of the rise and fall of
[30:59] nations
[31:01] and whatever happens in this country
[31:05] god's word will stand
[31:08] whether america's op vanishes off the
[31:12] face of the planet
[31:13] god's word stands and i'll go even
[31:17] further is that the true
[31:19] church of god it started under the roman
[31:22] empire
[31:23] right the roman empire got destroyed it
[31:26] got broken up
[31:27] it changed and what what's happening the
[31:30] true church of god the bride
[31:32] of christ is still standing is still
[31:35] going forward so regardless of what
[31:37] happens in this country
[31:39] i hope we're not too upset about what's
[31:42] going on
[31:43] in washington d.c i for one i
[31:46] i want to know what's happening in my
[31:48] world but i'll be frank with you i
[31:51] don't care i what i do care about
[31:54] is you about your soul
[31:59] what i do care about is being pleasing
[32:02] to god
[32:03] and honoring him regardless of what
[32:06] happens to this
[32:07] once great country
[32:11] that doesn't matter real really i mean
[32:14] we have to come to that place where
[32:15] we're not so
[32:16] worked up about what's happening with
[32:19] the politics that's this world
[32:21] our citizenship is in heaven
[32:25] and we need to align our thoughts our
[32:28] heart
[32:29] our attitudes with that
[32:33] and so just everybody calm down
[32:37] god is in control whatever you think
[32:40] about
[32:41] stolen elections and all the rhetoric
[32:44] that's going on both sides
[32:46] really that's irrelevant to god's
[32:49] purpose for you
[32:51] it may have some impact persecution
[32:54] and prison and suffering and pandemics
[32:58] yes they come and they go but god's word
[33:02] will stand
[33:04] and our obedience to the word is not
[33:06] based on circumstances
[33:08] easiness what it might be i i'm i'm
[33:11] i think what brother matt preached
[33:14] preached on last
[33:15] week was so incredibly profound
[33:19] and i think i hope if you didn't listen
[33:22] please i'm
[33:23] i'm begging you the last time you
[33:25] preached i think it was on wednesday
[33:26] brother matt
[33:28] go listen to that again because it's a
[33:30] it's a great
[33:31] kind of correction to the way of
[33:34] thinking that has gone forth
[33:36] in the message over the years so i'm not
[33:39] i'm not trying to
[33:41] what i'm saying i'm not trying to
[33:43] musicians you guys can go it's going to
[33:45] be a minute
[33:47] i love you guys thank you
[33:51] i'm not trying to come against that or
[33:52] say there's going to be a great
[33:53] persecution rise up
[33:55] what i'm trying to say is whatever
[33:57] happens
[34:00] wherever you are whatever country you
[34:02] are
[34:03] should not impact your faith in god
[34:08] and there is a there is
[34:12] a deceptive and evil american
[34:15] quote unquote gospel though it isn't a
[34:18] gospel at all
[34:20] it's demonic and it's so tied
[34:23] right now to donald trump and the
[34:25] republican party
[34:27] and i'm afraid many message believers
[34:30] have fallen prey to the deception
[34:35] and look i know donald trump has done
[34:38] good things
[34:39] some good things but he himself as a man
[34:43] is wicked
[34:44] and he's a narcissist and he's all about
[34:47] himself
[34:48] let let everyone be loyal to me and i'm
[34:51] i'm not going to be loyal to anyone else
[34:54] it's not the attribute the heart of a
[34:57] christian
[34:59] and people have had their faith so tied
[35:03] together to this political movement to
[35:06] this man
[35:08] that i'm sure they're very distraught
[35:10] and disappointed
[35:13] shame on us shame on us
[35:19] this word is our absolute and i know
[35:21] that everyone
[35:22] well of course i agree with that why
[35:24] don't you live it then
[35:30] i'm ju i just want to stand and rebuke
[35:32] the spirit of
[35:33] american politics that's gotten into the
[35:37] church
[35:38] to the message churches of today
[35:43] flee from that spirit it's nothing but
[35:46] death destruction and total deception
[35:52] do you have that power point otherwise
[35:53] i'm just gonna keep going
[35:58] all right i think that's well into it
[36:01] can we go back
[36:02] to the title screen
[36:10] it's saying it is number one all right i
[36:13] mean
[36:14] let's see that's my first scripture but
[36:15] there's supposed to be a title screen
[36:18] we're good we're good all right let's
[36:20] stand as we read the scripture
[36:22] deuteronomy 7 verse 9.
[36:29] know therefore that the lord thy god he
[36:31] is god the faithful god which keepeth
[36:33] covenant
[36:34] and mercy with them that love him and
[36:37] keep his commandments
[36:38] to a thousand generations amen
[36:41] can be seated i'm going to be speaking
[36:44] on the subject knowing god part five
[36:48] and we'll be looking at
[36:52] several attributes of god starting with
[36:55] the faithfulness of god and then
[36:58] the love of god and that probably will
[37:01] be as far
[37:02] as we get today
[37:06] the faithfulness of god well
[37:10] we live in a day that people barely
[37:13] mean what they say anymore
[37:17] they say something then they turn around
[37:20] and they do the very opposite thing
[37:23] people not only divorce in an
[37:26] instant but now they're so confident
[37:29] of unfaithfulness they often don't even
[37:32] get married at all
[37:36] and of course we we've all been
[37:38] unfaithful
[37:40] in our hearts to christ we've sinned
[37:42] against him
[37:45] that's that's clear
[37:48] as long as you're honest with yourself
[37:49] and not so full full of pride
[37:52] that you that you're blind
[37:56] but if you're honest with yourself you
[37:57] know that you sin
[37:59] the bible says he that says that he has
[38:02] no
[38:03] sin is a liar and the truth is not in
[38:05] him so i'm just
[38:06] saying if you think you don't have sin
[38:07] you're a liar which is a sin
[38:10] so you're a sinner anyway
[38:16] but where this is the world that we live
[38:19] in
[38:21] a world of unfaithfulness a world of
[38:24] dishonesty
[38:25] a world of calculated lying
[38:32] in our there's no such thing as
[38:36] faithfulness and honesty in politics
[38:38] even those who are
[38:40] extolling themselves as faithful and
[38:42] doing everything that they said they
[38:43] would do
[38:44] are not doing everything that they said
[38:46] they would do
[38:48] and that are lying constantly and
[38:50] whoever is the best and most convincing
[38:52] liar
[38:54] gets voted into political office
[38:58] the one that convinces everyone i'm not
[39:00] lying all the time
[39:02] that's who's going to be voted in we all
[39:05] know better
[39:06] we all know better but as christians
[39:10] we should be in the same characteristic
[39:13] as
[39:15] our god he's faithful he wants he calls
[39:18] us to be faithful
[39:20] so faithfulness is a quality that is
[39:24] absolutely
[39:24] essential to god's character god is
[39:27] always
[39:28] faithful to his word and he always
[39:30] fulfills his word
[39:33] second timothy 2
[39:38] verse 13 if we believe not
[39:41] yet he abideth faithful he cannot
[39:45] deny himself that's
[39:48] that verse always really stuns me
[39:54] if we believe not
[39:57] yet he remains he continually
[40:01] stays faithful he cannot deny himself
[40:05] what does that last part have to do with
[40:08] the first part
[40:09] if we believe not then all of a sudden
[40:12] talks about how god's faithful and he
[40:13] cannot
[40:14] deny himself well maybe because we're a
[40:17] part of him
[40:19] and he's made a promise to to us that
[40:22] he's he that started a work will be
[40:23] faithful to complete it
[40:25] even when we go into places where we're
[40:27] living in
[40:28] and under unbelief god remains faithful
[40:33] he'll pull us he'll bring us to
[40:36] repentance
[40:38] he will fulfill his word for god to be
[40:41] unfaithful it would mean that
[40:43] he's not god he's it would mean that
[40:46] he's denying
[40:48] himself in other words god becoming an
[40:50] atheist
[40:52] so god is perfectly faithful
[40:56] in other words it's impossible for god
[40:59] to be unfaithful
[41:02] hebrews 6 18 that by two immutable
[41:05] things in which it was
[41:06] impossible for god to lie
[41:10] we might have a strong consolation who
[41:12] have fled
[41:13] for refuge to lay hold upon the hope
[41:16] set before us
[41:20] it's not even a possibility for god to
[41:23] lie
[41:23] and and we're gonna we're gonna talk
[41:25] about just for a little bit
[41:28] you know these places where we get into
[41:30] our lives
[41:31] and we're claiming god's promises and we
[41:34] don't see
[41:35] anything happening it seems like he's
[41:38] quiet he's silent
[41:41] all right we're going to talk about that
[41:42] but we should understand
[41:45] first god's character god's nature
[41:48] because when we get
[41:48] understand god's character and nature
[41:52] as a faithful god that issue
[41:56] should never come up in our hearts
[41:59] right psalms uh
[42:02] 30 6 5 says thy mercy o lord
[42:06] is in the heavens and thy faithfulness
[42:08] reaches
[42:10] unto the clouds amen
[42:13] it's vast it's vast it's something that
[42:17] we
[42:18] we can barely measure we can't even
[42:20] measure
[42:22] numbers 23 19 god is not a man
[42:26] that he should lie neither the son of
[42:28] man that he should repent
[42:30] hath he said and shall he not do it or
[42:32] hath he spoken and shall he
[42:34] not make it good amen
[42:39] god has over and over again fulfilled
[42:42] his
[42:43] word you know he said through isaiah
[42:48] behold a virgin shall conceive 800 years
[42:52] before a virgin
[42:53] did conceive he said after 400 he told
[42:57] abraham after
[42:58] 400 years i will deliver this people
[43:01] and he did exactly that hebrews hebrews
[43:05] 10
[43:05] 23 says he is faithful
[43:08] that promised
[43:12] always faithful that promised
[43:16] however as we said there's times in our
[43:19] life
[43:21] that god allows the circumstances
[43:24] to be set against us to test
[43:28] do we believe in his faithfulness
[43:32] you see we're we want instant answers
[43:35] and instant satisfaction to god's
[43:37] promises
[43:39] and god is a lot more patient than we
[43:42] are
[43:44] god has you know if you really
[43:46] understand god's attributes
[43:48] they all work perfectly together
[43:51] right god's faithfulness
[43:54] is also connected to god's
[43:59] knowledge or his wisdom right
[44:02] his his sovereign purpose is overseeing
[44:06] all of this so it's god's faithfulness
[44:10] is not a vending machine 25 cents in and
[44:12] you get your
[44:14] promise it's not of any vending machine
[44:17] god has purposes to fulfill on the earth
[44:20] and we can go through all redemption
[44:22] history and see
[44:24] abraham god gave him a promise
[44:27] you'd think well they're going to get a
[44:29] son right away it's like it just
[44:31] hung out there hung out there and hung
[44:34] out there and
[44:35] both of them even though god's memorial
[44:39] is that they were faithful
[44:40] because they obeyed mostly
[44:44] because they believed right because they
[44:47] had faith and yet it seemed many times
[44:50] they doubted but he is faithful
[44:53] that promised he cannot deny himself
[44:56] and so they laughed and they tried to
[45:00] make it come to pass
[45:01] their own way which is a danger for all
[45:04] of us
[45:06] god doesn't need our help he can bring
[45:08] it to pass perfectly on his own
[45:10] it's up to us to wait but he allows
[45:14] time to go by because he's trying
[45:18] our faith he's testing our faith
[45:22] why would he need to do that because
[45:26] when he tests our faith we grow
[45:30] muscles faith muscles right
[45:34] we sprout
[45:37] not you ladies but we men sprout faith
[45:40] hair on our chests
[45:42] right you know it's it's a
[45:46] brother branham says it's a burly faith
[45:48] if god
[45:50] when when you have children and you give
[45:52] them
[45:53] everything they want the minute they ask
[45:55] for it what happens
[45:58] what happens character is lacking
[46:02] character becomes weak and if god gave
[46:05] us
[46:05] everything that we asked for
[46:07] instantaneously
[46:09] when we asked what would it be
[46:12] we would be we would have a lack of
[46:15] character
[46:16] what is the thing that god wants in us
[46:18] most
[46:21] to see himself his character
[46:24] so therefore the faithful god says wait
[46:29] amen it says believe
[46:32] and i think brother brother travis and i
[46:34] were talking
[46:35] about this last night the greatest
[46:38] thing the greatest kind of faith is not
[46:41] the kind of faith that just pulls down
[46:43] miracles constantly we love that we want
[46:46] that
[46:47] not dismissing it whatsoever but the
[46:49] greatest kind of faith is when you see
[46:51] nothing and when you feel nothing you
[46:54] just hold on
[46:57] you just hold on fact not only when you
[47:00] see nothing
[47:01] when you see everything is contrary
[47:05] to what you're believing for it's
[47:07] exactly the opposite
[47:09] all evidence points to god is not
[47:12] faithful
[47:14] now again we talk about it in a
[47:15] doctrinal way and it seems
[47:17] what are you talking about all evidence
[47:18] points to god's faithful your nuts
[47:21] i'm talking about in your life in the
[47:23] times you've prayed for something
[47:25] and you've waited and you've agonized
[47:27] and you're probably in the
[47:28] many of us are in the middle of that now
[47:33] and god says wait i have something
[47:36] better for you
[47:37] and that's my life my character
[47:43] you know i mean let's just put it put it
[47:45] in terms
[47:46] newborn babies die
[47:50] stillborn mothers die
[47:54] children live dads leave
[47:57] big families behind pass away
[48:00] um relatives that we prayed for believe
[48:04] for
[48:06] uh we experience painful things us may a
[48:10] spouse dies or leave or leaves you
[48:13] or one of your children dies or you have
[48:16] a miscarriage
[48:17] what do you what what happens
[48:20] did i do something wrong and then you
[48:24] start to get
[48:25] this spirit of unbelief why would god
[48:28] do this if we understand god's character
[48:33] we understand god is good
[48:36] and god is always working for our good
[48:40] and we don't always understand what that
[48:43] is
[48:44] the the fact is god is doing tens of
[48:47] thousands of things in your life
[48:50] and you're only aware of a couple of
[48:52] them
[48:53] and and so the reality is we need to
[48:57] trust
[48:58] and i think it always amy played a song
[49:01] for me yesterday
[49:03] i think it always comes down to this
[49:04] when we come to this place
[49:07] where we're facing trials difficulties
[49:09] and then as a result
[49:10] doubt in god god comes
[49:13] to us with an answer in the book of job
[49:16] where were you when i laid the
[49:19] foundations of the earth
[49:21] when i stretched out and measured the
[49:24] sea
[49:24] and and he goes through all this vast
[49:26] detail of his
[49:27] incredible immense creation in other
[49:30] words
[49:31] be still and know that i am god
[49:36] my uh my aunt has a
[49:40] wonderful testimony about that verse
[49:45] she my long before i was born but
[49:49] my my cousin they were
[49:54] i'm trying to not cry too much so just
[49:57] i'm gonna breathe
[50:02] my my cousin was
[50:05] skiing down down down a big hill and
[50:07] there was
[50:08] lots of people not skiing sledding as a
[50:11] little
[50:12] little kid i think under six years old i
[50:15] don't remember the exact
[50:17] age she was in and as she was going down
[50:20] she stopped
[50:21] and kind of in the middle someone else
[50:23] came in head first
[50:26] just nailed her and went to the hospital
[50:28] and and
[50:29] died some hours later and it was just
[50:33] devastating for the whole family
[50:38] and uh my aunt seal she
[50:42] took her bible and and went to the
[50:45] psalms and saw that scripture
[50:47] be still and know that i am god
[50:53] and it's been our life verse ever since
[50:55] then
[50:58] and uh we don't understand
[51:03] we don't know why god does things
[51:06] sometimes
[51:08] but be still and know that he's god he's
[51:12] faithful
[51:13] and he loves you and he has a purpose
[51:17] and it hurts i know
[51:20] and he knows that when he hurts
[51:25] when you hurt he's hurting with you
[51:29] he cares you can put your cares on him
[51:32] and he'll take care of you
[51:36] don't give yourself over to that
[51:37] unbelief amen
[51:40] rebuke the devil he'll flee from you but
[51:44] take god's word for your life
[51:48] take this bible
[51:51] for your life for your comfort
[51:55] because god is faithful
[52:00] any of you know the story of william
[52:02] cooper
[52:06] he's the he's the one that wrote the
[52:09] the believe that's right he wrote the
[52:12] song there is a fountain filled with
[52:13] blood
[52:16] and he wrote the song god moves in in a
[52:18] mysterious way
[52:21] and he suffered from depression all his
[52:23] life
[52:25] terrible tried to kill himself multiple
[52:28] times
[52:30] and he he he loved the word of god
[52:34] and he loved god with all his heart but
[52:36] he constantly
[52:38] suffered from depression and
[52:44] through it all he leaned on god but he
[52:46] despaired of his own salvation
[52:49] constantly he believed with all his
[52:51] heart
[52:52] but he was in constant despair
[52:56] and he wrote these words and i think
[52:58] it's just knowing his background
[53:02] what what beautiful words he wrote
[53:05] there is a fountain filled with blood
[53:06] and but this hymn
[53:08] god moves in a mysterious way
[53:11] judge not the lord by feeble sense but
[53:14] trust him
[53:14] for his grace behind a frowning frowning
[53:18] providence he hides a smiling face
[53:22] his purposes will ripen fast unfolding
[53:25] every hour
[53:26] the bud may have a bitter taste but
[53:28] sweet will be the flower
[53:31] blind unbelief is sure to air and scan
[53:34] his work in god's work in vain
[53:37] god is his own interpreter and he will
[53:40] make it plain
[53:42] amen we don't always understand god's
[53:45] purposes
[53:48] but if we believe and we trust in his
[53:51] faithfulness
[53:52] no matter what we will have an answer
[53:57] we will see his great wisdom
[54:00] worked out in our lives through
[54:04] heartache and sorrow
[54:11] sin produces evil evil produces
[54:14] all kinds of suffering
[54:18] but for a christian suffering has
[54:21] meaning it has purpose god takes it and
[54:25] he uses it
[54:26] to cause us to grow in his life and
[54:29] character and in his ex
[54:30] in our experience with him and the love
[54:33] of god
[54:36] he's not coming for a bunch of milk
[54:38] toast
[54:39] christians he's he's coming for
[54:42] tested and tried and faithful
[54:47] people that have been through
[54:52] the fire and back and they prevailed
[54:55] overcoming
[54:59] it means there's struggles there's
[55:00] trials there's
[55:02] there's pain brother branham says this
[55:06] in the sermon
[55:07] i know
[55:11] and why does god let troubles come
[55:15] god harnesses trouble puts bits in its
[55:17] mouth and makes it obey him and those
[55:20] troubles bring us
[55:21] into a closer fellowship with god
[55:25] and that beautiful he
[55:28] he makes those troubles bow
[55:32] in obedience to him
[55:36] psalm 119
[55:39] verse 75 says i know lord that thy
[55:42] judgments are right
[55:44] that thou in faithfulness has afflicted
[55:48] me
[55:50] my psalm
[55:53] 119 verse 71 it is good for me that i
[55:57] have been afflicted
[55:59] that i might learn thy statutes
[56:03] this is not this is not a weakling
[56:07] kind of walk that we're talking about
[56:10] here
[56:11] this is a rugged christian
[56:15] walk that abides
[56:19] why why can we abide these troubles in
[56:21] these trials
[56:22] because we have a faithful god amen
[56:27] psalms 89 31-34
[56:31] if they break my statutes and keep not
[56:33] com my commandments then will i visit
[56:35] their transgression with the rod
[56:38] and their iniquity with stripes
[56:40] nevertheless my loving kindness will i
[56:42] not utterly take from him nor suffer my
[56:45] faithfulness to fail
[56:46] my covenant will i not break nor alter
[56:49] the thing that has gone
[56:51] out of my lips
[56:54] god allows troubles
[56:57] sometimes to correct us it's not always
[56:59] that way
[57:02] it's not always that way sometimes
[57:03] trouble is is just you're walking with
[57:05] god and satan's against you
[57:08] but other times god says i'm going to
[57:10] allow these difficulties to come in your
[57:13] life
[57:14] to bring you closer to me to correct you
[57:18] to teach you and that correction is what
[57:22] my loving kindness
[57:27] amen job 5 19 he shall deliver thee
[57:31] in six troubles yea and seven there
[57:33] shall no
[57:34] evil touch thee now if we have the
[57:38] gospel
[57:38] the american gospel we read no evil
[57:41] touch penis
[57:42] we're going to have an easy life what
[57:44] does it mean
[57:45] no evil shall touch me means he's going
[57:48] to keep you
[57:50] from the evil one in other words you're
[57:53] not going to fall into his
[57:54] grips and come under his dominion
[57:57] you're going to stay under the
[58:00] faithfulness
[58:01] of god it doesn't mean that
[58:05] evil things won't happen to you it
[58:06] doesn't mean
[58:09] that you won't face great trials
[58:12] no not at all what it does mean is that
[58:15] god is going to keep you from
[58:17] going going to make it so that you will
[58:20] not be
[58:20] destroyed and brought to unbelief
[58:24] through them
[58:30] a.w pink writes apprehension of this
[58:33] truth will check
[58:34] our murmurings the lord knows what is
[58:37] best for each of us
[58:39] one effect of resting on this truth will
[58:42] be to silence
[58:43] our petulant complainings god is greatly
[58:47] honored
[58:48] when under trial and chastening we have
[58:50] good thoughts of him
[58:52] vindicate his wisdom and justice and
[58:54] recognize his love
[58:56] in his rebukes amen that's beautiful
[59:00] first peter 4 verse 19 says wherefore
[59:04] let him
[59:05] them that suffer according to the will
[59:07] of god
[59:08] commit the keeping of their souls to him
[59:11] in well-doing as unto a faithful
[59:15] creator amen he's a isn't isn't that
[59:18] amazing peter puts together
[59:20] suffering afflictions and a faithful
[59:22] creator
[59:24] it's not con it's not a contradiction to
[59:28] demonic
[59:29] way of thinking fleshly way of thinking
[59:33] suffering is in contradistinction to
[59:36] a faithful god but according to the
[59:38] scriptural way of thinking is
[59:41] suffering we can commit ourselves now to
[59:45] a faithful god
[59:47] amen all right let's go to the next one
[59:51] the love of god
[59:54] and we're just going to
[59:57] black that out for a second so we talked
[1:00:01] before about
[1:00:02] the nature of god god is spirit god is
[1:00:05] love
[1:00:06] god is light so the love of god is
[1:00:09] one of the just the primary attributes
[1:00:13] of god that many that his faithfulness
[1:00:16] and his goodness and his mercy
[1:00:18] all these things flow together
[1:00:24] unfortunately in today's day and age
[1:00:27] god's love is looked upon as some
[1:00:30] kind of form of agreeable weakness
[1:00:34] right he wants us to be good but since
[1:00:37] we're not good he just resigns himself
[1:00:39] and says well i'll take pity on them
[1:00:42] god loves us all is a phrase that
[1:00:46] you'll hear spoken and you may have said
[1:00:48] it yourself and
[1:00:49] i'm sure i've said it too unfortunately
[1:00:52] it's often turned into that
[1:00:54] all he does and all he is and it means
[1:00:56] that god wants us to have
[1:00:58] a good self-esteem no matter what and he
[1:01:01] just agrees with everything we do
[1:01:03] and lets us continue on to live however
[1:01:06] we want
[1:01:07] because i mean he loves us
[1:01:13] it's very extremely to the extreme
[1:01:17] unscriptural
[1:01:21] this is the reason that we see so little
[1:01:23] love
[1:01:24] for god amongst people that profess to
[1:01:27] be christians
[1:01:30] because they have a sappy god that lets
[1:01:33] them do anything
[1:01:34] they want they have no fire in their
[1:01:37] heart to live
[1:01:38] and love this god
[1:01:43] his commandments mean very little
[1:01:46] what is the greatest commandment love
[1:01:49] the lord your god with all your heart
[1:01:50] with all your soul with all your mind
[1:01:52] and with all your strength
[1:01:55] that's the greatest commandment and why
[1:01:57] would you see so little love for god
[1:01:59] because they don't know god
[1:02:02] in truth that's the problem
[1:02:05] because of this false doctrine of the
[1:02:07] love of god that we have
[1:02:09] pervasive in the world the airways are
[1:02:12] full of it
[1:02:14] every nation is filled with the false
[1:02:17] doctrine
[1:02:17] of the charismatic movement
[1:02:21] when we when we go to the middle east
[1:02:23] and deal with
[1:02:24] new believers we treat them as though
[1:02:26] they've never heard the gospel before
[1:02:27] even though they've watched
[1:02:29] benny hinn and joyce meyer
[1:02:32] for years why because they've never
[1:02:34] heard the gospel
[1:02:36] what they've heard is false doctrine
[1:02:40] about a loving god that wants them to be
[1:02:42] happy and rich
[1:02:44] it's playing to the emotions of people
[1:02:47] those
[1:02:48] men those women are not servants of god
[1:02:52] they're servants of the enemy and you
[1:02:55] when you
[1:02:56] do missions work you'll know that you
[1:02:59] start from scratch with those people
[1:03:00] that it came to christ on benny hyun or
[1:03:02] joyce meyer
[1:03:04] they're they're as dead as that doorknob
[1:03:06] in the back
[1:03:08] why are they why why are they dead
[1:03:11] because they've never they've never
[1:03:13] really met god
[1:03:15] they've met another concept about who
[1:03:18] god is and they use this
[1:03:20] book to get their theology but it's a
[1:03:24] perverted
[1:03:25] gospel
[1:03:28] and so why is there so little love for
[1:03:31] god
[1:03:32] why is there so little fire for god and
[1:03:34] i'm
[1:03:36] i'm sad to say it but
[1:03:39] is it true in our message churches today
[1:03:42] is there so little
[1:03:44] true passion and fire for god
[1:03:47] because do we really know him or we're
[1:03:50] just following a tradition
[1:03:52] tradition of our family and we know this
[1:03:54] is a better way to live so
[1:03:56] hey let's just just live this way and we
[1:04:00] feed our feed our minds on
[1:04:01] the bible and the world and all that and
[1:04:04] we're a little bit good and a little bit
[1:04:06] bad
[1:04:08] that's not the christian walk
[1:04:12] a christian walk is on fire for god
[1:04:15] yes of course ups and downs
[1:04:19] always ups and downs but the reality is
[1:04:23] that there is something
[1:04:24] inside of you that's pushing you
[1:04:28] that's revealing and correcting and
[1:04:30] teaching and dealing with you and
[1:04:32] doesn't allow you
[1:04:34] to live your own life
[1:04:37] that's the new birth it's a totally new
[1:04:41] creation it's not
[1:04:42] something from this world and it's not
[1:04:44] something that you're in control of
[1:04:47] you come to the place where you realize
[1:04:50] you're out of control and the more you
[1:04:51] grow the less control you want
[1:04:56] you would just want him and that's it
[1:05:01] but what does it come from knowing him
[1:05:04] knowing him in truth
[1:05:05] and it's such a fine line we talked
[1:05:08] about it before you can know
[1:05:11] about the love of god and you can have
[1:05:14] the perfect theology of the love of god
[1:05:16] and have it in balance with his
[1:05:18] sovereignty and his holiness but what
[1:05:21] about knowing
[1:05:22] that god personally coming into that
[1:05:25] relationship where he truly has his hand
[1:05:28] on you
[1:05:31] hey i mean if if we wanted to if we
[1:05:33] wanted to just
[1:05:35] throw out a bunch of platitudes and
[1:05:38] fill you up on the supernatural and love
[1:05:40] of god and all these things that
[1:05:42] the pews would be full pews would be
[1:05:45] full why aren't the pews full
[1:05:47] we're trying we're doing everything we
[1:05:49] can to preach the truth and the world
[1:05:50] doesn't want it
[1:05:53] but we want the love true
[1:05:56] love of god in our hearts we want to
[1:05:59] know
[1:06:00] him in the reality all the reality
[1:06:03] of who he is god has no grandchildren
[1:06:07] you have to be born again you personally
[1:06:10] not just under the influence of
[1:06:12] christianity of the message of your
[1:06:15] parents of your godly parents not just
[1:06:18] under that influence that's great
[1:06:21] you know we all want our children to be
[1:06:23] under the right influence
[1:06:25] but that's not the new birth
[1:06:28] it's just a dead person trying to
[1:06:31] pretend that they're alive
[1:06:33] it's a weekend at bernie's
[1:06:37] dragging around a dead body
[1:06:40] but they're not alive in christ get
[1:06:43] alive in christ
[1:06:46] how do you get alive in christ this is
[1:06:49] life eternal that they might know thee
[1:06:51] the only true god in jesus christ whom
[1:06:53] now has sent
[1:06:54] brother branham said you can never pray
[1:06:56] too much for revelation
[1:07:00] how are you going to know god how are
[1:07:01] you going to know truly know his love
[1:07:05] for you personally not just the doctrine
[1:07:07] of it for you personally
[1:07:09] a revelation to you personally i can't
[1:07:13] give it
[1:07:14] i can preach about it i can preach it
[1:07:18] but only god can give it amen
[1:07:23] we don't want to produce a bunch of
[1:07:25] lukewarm
[1:07:26] christians who show none of the
[1:07:29] character of christ
[1:07:30] in their own lives we want to live
[1:07:35] and walk in the truth of god's love
[1:07:40] all right deuteronomy 7
[1:07:44] 7-8 the lord did not
[1:07:47] set his love upon you this is i call
[1:07:50] this the humility verse
[1:07:52] the lord did not set his love upon you
[1:07:54] nor choose you
[1:07:56] because you are more in number than any
[1:07:57] people for you were the fewest of all
[1:07:59] people
[1:08:00] but because the lord loved you and
[1:08:02] because he would keep the oath which he
[1:08:04] had sworn unto your fathers hath the
[1:08:06] lord brought you out with a mighty hand
[1:08:08] and redeemed you out of the house of
[1:08:09] bondmen from the hand of pharaoh king of
[1:08:12] egypt
[1:08:15] god just gave us a circular argument
[1:08:19] the lord loved you because the lord
[1:08:20] loved you
[1:08:24] what does that mean in other words he
[1:08:26] sovereignly chose to love you for
[1:08:28] nothing that was good inside of you or
[1:08:31] about you
[1:08:32] there was nothing that merited his love
[1:08:37] what you merited was his wrath
[1:08:40] but because of the mystery of his
[1:08:43] sovereign eternal will he chose you
[1:08:47] called you justified you and glorified
[1:08:51] you
[1:08:52] amen ii timothy 1 verse 9
[1:08:56] says who has saved us and called us with
[1:08:58] a holy calling
[1:09:00] not according to our works but according
[1:09:02] to his own
[1:09:03] purpose and grace which was given us in
[1:09:06] christ jesus before
[1:09:08] the world began so it was according to
[1:09:10] his own purpose
[1:09:12] and grace nothing to do with us nothing
[1:09:14] to do with our
[1:09:16] our works it was just all hymn first
[1:09:19] john 4 19
[1:09:21] we love him because he first loved
[1:09:24] us he set his love upon us
[1:09:27] before the foundation of the world for
[1:09:30] all of eternity he loved you
[1:09:34] why because he loved you
[1:09:39] you didn't earn it you didn't merit it
[1:09:41] you didn't do anything to deserve it you
[1:09:42] didn't choose him and then therefore he
[1:09:44] chose you
[1:09:46] in fact we did everything we could
[1:09:48] possibly do to earn
[1:09:50] his anger he love you because he cho
[1:09:54] he loves you because he chose to love
[1:09:57] you
[1:10:01] god's love is eternal
[1:10:04] god is eternal therefore his love is
[1:10:06] eternal
[1:10:07] ephesians 1 4 and 5 says according as he
[1:10:10] hath chosen us in him
[1:10:12] before the foundation of the world that
[1:10:14] we should be holy and without blame
[1:10:16] before him in love
[1:10:19] having predestinated us unto the
[1:10:20] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[1:10:23] himself according to good pleasure
[1:10:25] of his will
[1:10:28] so we were chosen before the world ever
[1:10:31] began
[1:10:32] and that in order that we would be holy
[1:10:34] and without blame
[1:10:36] what did he do this in in love
[1:10:39] all of his purpose in us and for us
[1:10:43] is because of his love jeremiah 31 verse
[1:10:47] 3 says the lord hath appeared of old
[1:10:49] unto me saying
[1:10:51] yea i have loved thee with an
[1:10:52] everlasting love
[1:10:54] therefore with loving kindness have i
[1:10:57] drawn thee
[1:10:58] amen god's love
[1:11:02] is sovereign romans 9
[1:11:05] 13 as it is written jacob have i loved
[1:11:09] but
[1:11:09] esau have i hated
[1:11:12] god chooses whom he loves merely based
[1:11:16] on his own sovereign will
[1:11:18] as we saw last week when talking about
[1:11:21] his foreknowledge
[1:11:23] it says that that the purpose of god
[1:11:26] according to election
[1:11:27] might stand jacob have i loved
[1:11:31] isaac i hated not that the purpose of
[1:11:32] god according to free will might stand
[1:11:35] but according to election
[1:11:39] god is sovereign god is love therefore
[1:11:43] it's sovereign love
[1:11:46] god's love is infinite ephesians 3
[1:11:50] 18 and 19 that we may be able to
[1:11:54] comprehend with all saints what is the
[1:11:55] breadth
[1:11:56] and length and depth and height and to
[1:12:00] know the love of christ which
[1:12:01] passes knowledge that you might be
[1:12:04] filled with all the fullness of god
[1:12:06] isn't that
[1:12:07] an incredible statement he wants us to
[1:12:09] know something that is beyond
[1:12:10] unders beyond knowing
[1:12:14] how do i know something that's beyond
[1:12:16] knowing you experience it
[1:12:19] by revelation by a relationship
[1:12:24] to know the love of christ which is
[1:12:27] beyond knowledge amen
[1:12:31] to do what when we know that love
[1:12:35] that has no end
[1:12:38] no beginning you can't get to the
[1:12:40] breadth you can't get to the length you
[1:12:41] can't get to the depth you can't get to
[1:12:42] the height
[1:12:44] when we know that personally what is it
[1:12:47] that you would be filled with the full
[1:12:49] all the fullness of god
[1:12:52] you want to be filled with all the
[1:12:53] fullness of god pray for a revelation of
[1:12:55] his love for you
[1:12:59] god's love is
[1:13:02] immutable james 1 17
[1:13:07] every good gift and every perfect gift
[1:13:09] is from above
[1:13:10] and cometh down from the father of
[1:13:12] lights with with whom
[1:13:14] is no variableness neither shadow of
[1:13:17] turning
[1:13:19] so god
[1:13:22] his love god god himself
[1:13:26] doesn't vary he doesn't have a shadow of
[1:13:29] turning
[1:13:30] you know we we we talk about a shadow
[1:13:33] light casts a shadow and that changes
[1:13:36] right throughout the day because the sun
[1:13:38] is moving
[1:13:39] and that shadow changes but with god
[1:13:43] there's no change there's no variance
[1:13:47] there's no he's this way one time and
[1:13:49] he's this way another time
[1:13:51] he's always the same and therefore we
[1:13:53] can bring that back to
[1:13:55] to this is that his love
[1:13:58] is unchanging there's no
[1:14:01] variableness or shadow of turning
[1:14:04] in his love no matter what
[1:14:08] you do he's still going to love you
[1:14:12] why because you're his child
[1:14:16] that will never change romans 8
[1:14:19] 35 through 39 who shall separate us from
[1:14:24] the love of christ
[1:14:26] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:14:28] persecution
[1:14:30] or fabin or nakedness or peril or sword
[1:14:34] now don't just run over those words
[1:14:37] it really sounds sometimes it sounds so
[1:14:40] highfalutin because it's
[1:14:42] it's king james but let's really look at
[1:14:45] it
[1:14:46] shall tribulation or distress
[1:14:49] persecution
[1:14:52] famine what is famine you don't have
[1:14:55] enough food to eat
[1:14:58] right nakedness
[1:15:02] it's not running around naked it's you
[1:15:05] don't have
[1:15:05] appropriate clothing in other words it's
[1:15:08] cold outside
[1:15:10] and you don't have a coat you don't have
[1:15:12] a blanket
[1:15:13] you don't have you don't have what is
[1:15:16] needed to keep you safe and
[1:15:17] and dry peril
[1:15:23] in other words dangers that you would
[1:15:25] face from
[1:15:26] from people attacking you or
[1:15:29] sword sword is
[1:15:34] was a means of execution cutting
[1:15:36] people's heads off
[1:15:38] to kill them so
[1:15:42] none of that can separate us from the
[1:15:45] love of christ
[1:15:46] what does that mean regardless of
[1:15:49] circumstances that you face
[1:15:52] in your life no matter how extreme they
[1:15:54] are
[1:15:55] they don't separate you from the love of
[1:15:57] christ
[1:16:01] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:16:03] killed
[1:16:04] all the day long we are accounted as
[1:16:07] sheep
[1:16:07] for the slaughter nay in all these
[1:16:11] things we are
[1:16:12] more than conquerors through him that
[1:16:15] loved us
[1:16:16] for i am persuaded sueded that neither
[1:16:18] death nor
[1:16:20] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[1:16:23] powers nor things present
[1:16:25] nor things to come nor height nor depth
[1:16:29] nor any other creature shall be able to
[1:16:31] separate us from the love of god
[1:16:34] which is in christ jesus our lord
[1:16:38] amen nothing will separate you that's
[1:16:42] not just a song
[1:16:43] lyric that's not just that's not just a
[1:16:46] scripture
[1:16:47] in a in some old dusty book
[1:16:51] that is god's heart
[1:16:54] for you personally nothing
[1:16:57] can separate you from his love
[1:17:01] that's that's the level of his immutable
[1:17:05] unchanging unalterable love
[1:17:10] god's love is holy
[1:17:13] hebrews 12 6 says for whom the lord
[1:17:15] loveth he chasteneth
[1:17:16] and scourgeth every son whom he receives
[1:17:20] he is holy and he tells us to be holy
[1:17:24] so through his love he corrects us
[1:17:28] to make us more holy more like him
[1:17:32] god's love is gracious
[1:17:36] ephesians 2 4 and 5 but god who is rich
[1:17:39] in mercy
[1:17:41] for his great great love wherewith he
[1:17:44] loved us
[1:17:45] even when we were dead in sins has
[1:17:47] quickened us together with christ
[1:17:50] by grace we are saved
[1:17:54] musicians if you'd come god's
[1:17:58] love extends grace
[1:18:02] to us we know that song the love of god
[1:18:06] is greater far than
[1:18:07] tongue or pen can ever tell
[1:18:11] it goes beyond the highest star and
[1:18:13] reaches to the lowest hell
[1:18:16] the guilty pair bowed down with care
[1:18:20] god gave his son to win his airing child
[1:18:22] he reconciled and parted
[1:18:24] from his sin o love of god how rich and
[1:18:28] pure how measureless and strong
[1:18:30] it shall forevermore endure the saints
[1:18:34] and angels song
[1:18:37] god is love
[1:18:43] that's that's what that's what it's not
[1:18:45] just that god has love we talked about
[1:18:47] that before
[1:18:49] that's what he is so
[1:18:52] whatever he does is love
[1:18:56] when when he judges
[1:19:00] the wicked sends them to the lake of
[1:19:02] fire
[1:19:04] say that's his wrath yes but it's his
[1:19:07] love
[1:19:08] to us because there's going to be a
[1:19:10] earth where god
[1:19:11] is all in all and we're dwelling on it
[1:19:15] so he he wipes out sin he wipes out evil
[1:19:19] and what is that
[1:19:22] we think it's it's god's wrath right
[1:19:26] to them it's god's wrath to us it's
[1:19:29] god's love
[1:19:31] you know and and i think it's easy
[1:19:36] to bring the doctrine god loves you
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:40] and to bring try to bring it as best we
[1:19:43] can in the balance
[1:19:45] of the scripture god is god's love is
[1:19:47] holy
[1:19:48] god's love is immutable god's love is
[1:19:51] sovereign god's love
[1:19:53] is eternal god's love is uninfluenced
[1:19:57] we want to bring it in the balance of
[1:20:00] the scriptures and yet
[1:20:04] it needs to be go from the pages
[1:20:09] to the heart to really
[1:20:12] know it not know facts
[1:20:16] i've given you facts now you've got to
[1:20:19] pray
[1:20:21] for revelation that the word would
[1:20:23] really be written on your heart
[1:20:26] not just something that oh oh that was a
[1:20:28] good message
[1:20:30] and we go on our way but really to
[1:20:33] study and and and and pray over it
[1:20:36] and ask god to re quicken and reveal
[1:20:40] these things to you we're not just
[1:20:42] getting up to give a nice sermon
[1:20:45] we want we really want to give you
[1:20:47] something to feed on to study
[1:20:51] that your soul would be filled that you
[1:20:54] would be encouraged that you would be
[1:20:56] strengthened
[1:20:56] that you'd be corrected all of these
[1:20:58] things
[1:21:00] otherwise our getting together is really
[1:21:02] completely in vain
[1:21:05] there's a lot of better preachers you
[1:21:07] could be streaming online than
[1:21:09] me hundreds thousands
[1:21:13] but what is what what do we want we we
[1:21:15] want god
[1:21:17] we don't want just a celebrity celebrity
[1:21:20] preacher
[1:21:22] we want god in our souls
[1:21:25] moving in a supernatural way
[1:21:32] not just not just in in word only
[1:21:36] but in a power that's within us and
[1:21:39] that's not just outward demonstration
[1:21:41] that's him keeping you
[1:21:45] through the worst suffering the worst
[1:21:48] difficulties the worst trials
[1:21:52] you know i think of brother don i don't
[1:21:55] want to call you out but brother don and
[1:21:57] sister lauren and
[1:21:59] and what they've went through and
[1:22:02] they're so
[1:22:03] they're so faithful why because they
[1:22:06] trust in a faithful god
[1:22:09] their their their faith strengthens my
[1:22:13] faith
[1:22:15] because they've been through it and
[1:22:17] they've seen a faithful god
[1:22:19] that loves them and never lets go of
[1:22:21] them
[1:22:23] and and is touching them and healing
[1:22:25] them
[1:22:26] and i love that and i thank god for that
[1:22:30] let's pray
[1:22:33] heavenly father
[1:22:34] [Music]
[1:22:37] we're so grateful for your grace and
[1:22:39] mercy to us
[1:22:45] you're a living god and you're proving
[1:22:48] it
[1:22:49] in and through your people in this hour
[1:22:55] may we really have that revelation in
[1:22:57] our heart of your faithfulness
[1:22:59] and of your love may it not just be
[1:23:03] words on a page and facts that we've
[1:23:05] written down in our notebook
[1:23:08] but may it become a living reality
[1:23:12] that we might live the kind of life that
[1:23:16] reflects the character of jesus christ
[1:23:21] lord we just want to
[1:23:24] commit these words into your hand lord
[1:23:27] and that you would take them
[1:23:29] and you would use them for your kingdom
[1:23:31] and for your glory
[1:23:33] we ask it in jesus name amen
