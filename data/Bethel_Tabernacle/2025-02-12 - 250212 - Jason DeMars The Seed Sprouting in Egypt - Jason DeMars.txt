the English language really uh was hoping to just come and enjoy the service and listen to brother Jason preach tonight and but the Lord had a different plan for me so we just say thank the Lord and want to give missions report if you want to go ahead and bring up the PowerPoint Zoe be great we're going to turn the scriptures to Isaiah chapter 19 amen and we will start at well help PowerPoint yeah verse 19 in that day there shall be shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to to the Lord and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors and he shall send them a savior and a great one and he shall deliver them and the Lord shall be known to Egypt and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day and shall do sacrifice and oblation yay they shall vow a vow unto the Lord and perform it amen let's pray Heavenly Father we just come before you Lord and we're so thankful for your goodness and mercy to us Lord we're so thankful for the spirit of Revelation that you've given to us Lord not that not just that you've provided to the bride in general but Lord that you've given to us as individuals Lord that we can know you in the power of your resurrection and the fellowship of your sufferings being made conformable to your death Lord we're we're a a Beyond privileged people Lord to be able to know you Lord in truth from the revelation of the scriptures Lord we pray for each one here Lord that your spirit would move in their hearts and in their minds and in their lives Lord I pray father that even under the sound of our voice tonight that there would be healing and deliverance and Supernatural things would happen in lives Lord we look to you commit ourselves to You For Your Glory we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless you be seated see if I can learn how to speak again without a uh an interpreter standing next to me you get so used to that flow that your brain starts slowing down a little bit and uh so we just pray the Lord helps to speed my brain up again are you downloading the PowerPoint problems okay well all I have is a PowerPoint tonight to show you you so that is a real problem but it was a a wonderful trip to Egypt the Lord really moved in a amazing way I I I know it's going to take a little bit because it's a lot of pictures and videos in that but I'll kind of get started with the initial portion um I traveled from January 27th to the February 10th thank you brother Tony brother Alex mulus traveled with me it's wonderful to have someone with me I'm so used to traveling by myself that the blessing of having someone that can communicate in your culture and language when you're in the Middle East is Untold um because you go many times two weeks three weeks and they really can't fully understand you and you really fully can't understand them though the though you can speak English to some of them it's just a it's a difficult thing so it was really uh strengthening for me to have brother Alex with and of course he preached a lot as well and the Lord used him in a mighty way we had 13 services in total during our time there several days where there was multiple services and we were in uh the Cairo metro area and also in uh Upper Egypt which I've got some if if we ever get it up I have some uh pictures that I can show on the map there our program that we've done the last two times in Egypt is we've really prayed and sought the Lord with this open door and really what we do is we preach the word just in Simplicity to the people they're very very simple uh humble people and so just in a very simple basic way bringing the word to them and then we follow the scripture we lay hands upon the sick and watch what God does for them and also give out a uh printed booklet uh of brother BR one of brother bram's sermons that's been translated into Arabic so that's really our program for every every church that we go to and um it's been the Lord's been moving through that uh the last time I was there it was about a year ago and I could see the results um from the ministers that we interacted with and and spoke to and there's a real critical thing going on there now um we had services at two Baptist Churches two Assemblies of God churches and then nine Pentecostal churches and uh I'll just say it's really refreshing to preach the message to people that have never heard it before because I think sometimes we get uh Stuck In The Weeds too often when we're preaching the message here and this one's got a quote to throw this way and this one's got a quote to throw that way but when you're preaching to people that they don't want a quote cuz they don't believe in the quote they want the scripture so you show them the scripture and it's amazing the reality of the message amen that goes along with it um when you bring the scripture to them and you know the Lord Has Done miracles in people's lives uh both both trips that we've done just taking the Simplicity of the word there the Pentecostal Church the difference between the Pentecostal church and the Assemblies of God church is the Pentecostal Church separated from Assemblies of God and be over the fact that they didn't believe that tongues is the initial evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost so it's they've started along the process already of on their own of receiving the message so it's just a I think it's a a natural process the Lord is leading them on we gave up out over 1500 books uh we laid hands uh upon over a thousand people and I'm still in the process of gathering testimonies but um uh one of the brothers that we visited and preach for his church last uh March um he he arranged and took us to a Baptist Church that he was in communication with the pastor with in aute and it was uh we pre I when I went there I was on my heart to preach what is the name and so I brought out water baptism just in a very simple way and the whole church including the pastor C caught it very very very easily very simply and then at the end we just took time to explain what the scripture says lay laying on on of hands we don't doesn't even say you need to pray for him just just lay laying on of hands is the promise if we do it in the name of Jesus miracles happen gave we gave testimonies and so we just brought them forward and they came and we just put our hands upon him in jesus' name one of the one of the sisters had been having severe headaches for two months and when we laid hands on her she was instantly healed um another one came forward and she's been having terrible pain in her knee from uh osteoarthritis and it's been been that way for many many years and the Lord touched and healed her from that amen another church uh was got the testimony right after the service when I was speaking with people um we laid hands upon her and she had a uh you know sometimes it's lost they don't know how to translate medical terminology unless they have Google Translate in front of them so she has a pain in her wrist I didn't know what the pain was or what the source but she's had it for a while and when we laid hands on her the Lord instantly healed her so the Lord is really uh supernat naturally vindicating the message to these people there um if I can skip forward but we're still in the process of gathering testimonies I hope everybody can see that okay um so you have Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt which is turned around you would think it's the opposite way we think in terms of strongly in ter terms of North and South but they think in terms of elevation and where the Nile is coming from so for them basically anything under uh Cairo and the where the Pyramids of Giza are is they all consider that Upper Egypt so when when we aute is in Upper Egypt and magaga where we went to is also in in Upper Egypt there and it's uh it's it's just amazing you could see here what this looks like it's the there's two freeways that go back and forth or go up to Cairo on either side of that green patch that green patch of course is the Nile and then the Nile Delta at the top and I mean it's just very abrupt it's like this there's no well it slowly turns into the desert no it's like here's farmland and here is the desert it's just absolutely instant and um I I learned uh recently that so you see there there's like a green patch sort of halfway in the middle I'll just walk over and point to it that's a lake that was created um there was a there was a prince in Egypt many years ago named uh Joseph that uh built a canal for feeding other areas of Farmland built it off of the Nile so really it if you look at it you'd think it's a river now but it's a canal and it goes up and it actually empties out in a man-made lake that they made there and it's called the canal of Joseph and I started doing some re research and realized that yeah that's actually goes back he's the one that he's the one that commissioned it and had it built it's obviously not in Biblical history but it's in uh Egyptian history is quite quite amazing so um the the Arabic names are just very funny the shamal means it's it's one of the followers of of of Muhammad so this little Christian village it's all Christians is named after one of the followers of the prophet of Muhammad so um that sham zalan is the the city that we stay in when we go down to the magaga area and brother Prince you'll see some pictures of him he's he's our host he hosted us last year and he hosted us also this year and the Lord's really revealing himself to this brother so as as is obligatory right brother Ken uh everyone that's new I should be a tour guide um at least charge the fees of a tour guide right took brother Alex to the the pyramids and got a chance to see that went to a during the during the day you're just kind of hanging out resting and fellowshipping so uh when especially in Cairo get a chance to go see a few different things it's it's good never ceases to amaze me how massive these stones are for the Great Pyramid it's hard to it's hard to really even capture it with a with a picture but as you see there the people and then as the size of the stones and it just goes up forever Alex also didn't listen to me brother Ken and uh somebody ended up he didn't even have a cell phone with him he had an iPad I walked out of the bathroom he's got a thing on his head they're trying to put him on a camel and he's they got his iPad taking a picture I just walked up this guy and I said give me that no we're going to take a picture I said I'm capable of taking a a picture and I don't charge a tip so so but we had to give him a tip anyways and the camel needed a tip also so yeah it happens brother Ken if they can trick you they'll find a way to trick you into getting a tip so there's at the Sphinx somebody asked me there if I liked Obama and this is uh I just put in a bunch of different pictures I'll kind of go through them and talk a little bit about them and some of the services um like I said every service was preaching the word doing our best to keep it as as simple as possible praying for the sick and uh you know you you you you do pray for a lot of sick people but everybody wants to bring their kids forward to be to be blessed also so so you you end up you know laying hands on the entire church basically and maybe some people from the street too but uh the the the first night we preached I had service at a Baptist Church and um I think I realized that I needed to bring my uh airpods to every service because I was looking on my watch and it was consistently like 105 110 DB and it was like I was getting sick it was so so loud we asked we asked them even brother megaly who who travels with us got up and said you know if it's over 90 cuz I told Brother megal if it's over 90 DB at 30 minutes people are losing their hearing as the days went along and we're praying for everybody I realize the half the old people are coming and saying will you pray for me my ears hurt I have a headache and I'm like brother megaly the reason why every a message of brother brandham and the Holy Spirit can take that however he wants to do that into their hearts so we're we're thankful for that people still have actually year round it seems like people still have their Christmas decorations up maybe a tree in the corner sometimes a bunch of things of Santa Claus we one of the churches they preached at they had Santa Claus all over the place I counted there was 15 stickies or whatever of Santa Claus around I was like brother megal uh I think my should have a talk with this brother so we did and he's like oh I didn't know all that let me take it down some of the different brothers that we preach for and their elders and ministers and their churches um that particular Church uh that that service I felt to go a totally different way just went with no notes all I had the scripture was there was a man sent from God whose name was John and I went there and I just started going into telling about you know in in this hour in this day there's another man sent from God Amen whose name was William Branham and started going through his his life and his his birth and uh when the Whirlwind met him when he was young young boy into 1933 1946 1963 and then brought it to to into my testimony and and what the Lord can do for them and was it was uh the Lord really moved in this service wonderfully and um the the best part about all this is we have there's a brother that brother Prince as I mentioned I'm sure I have him and he helped us hand out the books of brother brandham last time we were there when we had a bunch of books with them brother Prince wanted to have keep them he didn't want brother megal to take them out I want to keep them in him out to the rest of the churches and this time as he's listening to our messages I'm just trying to I'm looking at him like how's he doing with all this and so finally the Lord led me down the line to preach and what is the name and to go into baptism and I said so what did you think of that message he's like brother I thought it was true before because I read the the book but now now it's now I'm completely convinced so I said okay so we have this church and another church and your church I said where should should we when should we meet for re-baptized everybody as I made that part of my message Acts 19 these these men had to be re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then I told my own testimony about because they're all they're all part of the Coptic church so they're sprinkled as infants then they're now now they're in a Pentecostal Church they've been baptized or baptized in the titles so I I told them my testimony I was a Lutheran got sprinkled then I got grew up and my family moved to a Baptist Church and so I got immersed in the titles Father Son and Holy Ghost but then the Lord brought brought the truth to me and I had I got re-baptized again so I emphasized that with them and the brother was like yeah there's a pool over here we can we can bring everyone there to re-baptize him so I was I was I was really surprised at his answer but thankful kids getting getting the books too so cute some of the services we did take you know people's requests and pray over them but we found that it was like the pastor walks up to us and is like it's time to get out of here it's like okay yeah it is 11:00 and service usually would start like 6:37 that's uh so next to me there is brother uh megaly he's the one I've been working with in Egypt for for seven years and uh man he's he put in tremendous amount of work to translate and preach and share the message and honestly for the up until just recently it's been in many ways quite a fruitless work at least to the eyes because he had a church and we introduced them the message did many conference with with them and some other guy promised to give everybody in the church money and so the whole church just left him so he said okay I'll just go start another Church in a poor area and help those people so he he did and he started there but then the Lord opened this door amongst this Pentecostal group and it's just uh we're so thankful to see this and he was he was about in tears hearing what brother Prince was saying and the different pastors were saying about about what they were hearing of the message and this is is uh brother meal's son who he's 23 years old and he's been been translating for me for 7 years and he's he's gone all his life to an English school and just uh tremendous I think about that as a 16-year-old trying to translate some of the messages we did for the people there and uh this very talented and and uh intelligent young man this is our typical thing so in once you get out of Cairo um you can't really go without military uh and police escort so typically they'll be they'll F they follow us wherever we go and this before there was just a few people but this time there was like four people in military fatigues and uh they were really you could see that they were really serious and they were concerned about it of course in in Upper Egypt it's a lot of villages and kind of backwards backwards uh Islamic ways and so the Muslim Brotherhood is very active in these areas so there really is a serious concern about um uh security and uh so every time you got you got the police behind you and there's a few times where we went back by by big groups of people and they quick get in front of you and the guys are getting their rifles ready um to go as they're going forward by God's grace everything was fine I'm I'm sure that the main reason why it was fine was the Lord and then second reason was that these military officials were pretty serious and then they after uh president Trump made his comments about Gaza you could see that they were really stepping up the security even more and more concerned even even one of the churches we were supposed to go preach at it was in a city called the Sons of Muhammad uh and the the it was about an hour away from where we were staying and they said no I don't think that's a good security situation I we you shouldn't go to that so we end up canceling that service and on on that Friday before we left so I'm not sure if it's going to play the videos but the uh yeah get just a little picture even if there's no sound of your brain getting jostled the entire way roads are incredibly bumpy pretty much I would say that's the typical Honduras and uh Africa Road situation you there's no falling asleep unless you're like coma toast pretty much man this this is the church we preach in in uh the typical way that the Protestant churches set up their churches they'll have like the the sanctuary on the main level and then they'll have Sunday school rooms on the next level and then they'll have living quarters on an upper level and so the living quarters are typically for visitors to stay in so that's we preached on this is the ground floor and the place we stayed was two floors up from this during the week that we were in the magaga area so um each day during the day we would get out get out for a little walk through the farm fields and when we did um they always called one of the the local police officers to to go with us and kind of watch over us and uh make sure security was good but beautiful beautiful Farmland I think they're growing wheat now um love seeing this just the traditional very very modest women in uh Upper Egypt very traditional even the men you'll see many times in the the full tunic that goes down to the their feet with the turbans on their heads and as an American you can't imagine that they're actually Christians you think well this is how Muslims dress but they're that's how that's how the Christians dress mus the Muslims stole it from them brother megal see I think there's a video here we we took this this is hooked up to just a pulley and you just pull yourself across this this is the um uh this is the Joseph's uh Canal we went across crocod I don't know that there's crocodiles Alex up there pulling us across the the river we're crossing this is also the typical Egypt they've got these canals in the middle of the cities and it ends up being a place where they pull water for their uh farmlands and also pretty much a garbage dump the poverty level there is pretty incredible um I was speaking with them just about like wages day wages and so forth and in Upper Egypt a farmer working like the first half of the day that would be hired in the field makes $3 so if you work both halves of the day you make $6 a day there this church was incredible they actually don't have a pastor it's just a uh a group of Elders and you know kind of a head Elder that oversees things and I uh when I was preaching on on on water baptism I want I wanted to take it a little different way I went into first I read in uh John 17 where Jesus says I I've manifested father I've manifested your name unto the men you have given me so I really spent time emphasizing so there's an importance of having a revelation of the name of the father I if you want to be one of those men that are in connection with Christ you have to be one that has the father's name revealed to you so then took it through you know there's one place that he put his name and then brought it to I've come in my father's name I said so I just asked the whole church I said so what's the F father's name Jesus then I went to John 14 and said you know the the comforter the Holy Spirit whom the father will send in my name said so what name does the Holy Spirit come in Jesus all right so then then I go go into and they're answering for me I'm not answering it for them they're answering it then I go into Luke 24 repentance and forgiv remission of sins should be preached in my name I said what name Jesus then Mark 16 so I go each gospel now we see in John 17 we see it's the name of Jesus in Luke 24 it's the name of Jesus in Mark 16 what it's the name of Jesus so now we go to Matthew 28:19 the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost is Father a name is son a name is Holy Ghost a name no no no all right so what name is it and I I just expected silence like this is the thinking time how am I going to figure it out people are just shouting over the whole church Jesus and I was like my goodness I didn't even open the book of Acts yet that was the particular service that I asked brother Prince afterwards so what is your what is your take on all this I see it so so thankful to see what the Lord's doing very simple faith when these these men came forward um asking for for a move a great move of the holy spirit in their church that was most of their the elders requests really touched my heart in the in the regular clothes next to me the Egyptian there uh one over from me that's brother Prince who's our host in uh this area he's also the secretary of the um Pentecostal Church in Egypt so uh he's has contact with almost all the pastors there and the fact that the Lord's really dealing with him it's a really a tremendous thing and a tremendous opportunity that opens up most all the churches that that are there that are Pentecostal across the whole country of Egypt he's he's in the back just surprises me I see that in the back he was in charge all the time every time going out to hand out brother bram's messages to everybody this is at uh the orphanage in acute this is how many has ever heard of Lillian Trasher or read her testimony okay so this is this is the orphanage that she started there she she passed away in 1961 but still it's still going and uh we have an open door to minister there it's Assemblies of God uh Under the Umbrella of Assemblies of God denomination so they they they support it brother megaly actually I was I was thinking about this while I was there and you know how God how God does things and how he moves in different ways and he can you know he to in order to get to his predestinated seed he will move Heaven and Earth and use a whole person's life just to get to that one seed and I begin to think about all the testimony and all the great things that God used lilan Trasher to do and I realize maybe she maybe back in the early 1900s God led her there because they knew there was going to be brother megali was going to need his mother was going to die his father was going to say I can't take care of this child they're going to say bring her to the orphanage bring him to the orphanage and they were going to raise him to love the word of God to understand the word of God and then the revelation of the message comes to his heart and now he's I mean really if if you if you look at at it he he's really one of the only full Believers of the message of the hour in Egypt at this point in time and one of the very few arabic speaking Believers of the word and so a lot rests on his shoulders so pray for him hold him up he's got a surgery coming up on a hernia surgery this this Saturday so remember him in prayer but wonderful to be a part of this and be able to see the kids we stay I think on the on the campus of the orphanage for three days so got out and walked around the campus and got to meet all kinds of kids they all want to shake your hand and say hi and ask if you like American or not American football but if you like the real football as they call it who's your favorite I don't know I only know Messi that's all don't follow it but just tremendous to see the kids there [Music] and God bless you probably my favorite part of the whole trip I'm going to switch I'm going to switch to this oneing out candy to all the kids than really special place and just so thankful how the Lord is opening doors and how the seed is being planted in Hearts you know it's it's been a long time and many people paying lip service to the message and saying that believe it but to really see you know brothers that that uh are catching it and their their desire is come back so we can re-baptize people so by God's grace in uh April end of April into early May I'll be going back and then in August we're going to try to gather all the ministers together to really lay the message out to everybody um probably in in the middle of August working on a plan for that but remember that in prayer it's kind of be most mostly my focus is working on that um we're going to do a full edit of the church ages book and try to get that printed as well as uh translate the Seven Seals like to have those both translated and edited and and printed by by August so we could put one in the hands of all their ministers in their church so just remember that all in prayer and uh I can't believe I went through 64 screens that fast but we're going to go to the scriptures and take a few minutes Galatians uh chapter three speak a little bit about be justified by faith but after that faith is come we're no long longer under a school Master for you are all children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there's neither Bond nor free there's neither male nor female for you're all one in Christ Jesus and if you be christs then are you Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise amen so as we look at the background in the book of this letter to Galatians that Paul writes of course we understand that there's a there's a big problem going on and that's that these people have had an experience with God they've heard the true gospel and someone's come behind and is sowing false seed amongst them and it's bringing confusion in them and so as we see Paul is building he's first telling them you know if anybody preaches anything then you've already heard and received let him let him be a cursed even if even if I change the message or an angel comes from heaven changes the message no it it can't be done can't be done what's already been preached to you is the truth and it didn't come to you you know by agreement of men or by me going to the apostles and saying please teach me the gospel I went into Arabia and I received the message directly from Jesus Christ by Revelation from Jesus Christ I didn't consult with any man except for when I went to Jerusalem I made known what the Lord had revealed to me to Peter and James and John and all they could say is praise the Lord that's exactly right just remember the poor that's that's all that's the only advice we can give to you so they added nothing to the Apostle Paul and didn't contradict him and so then he said many of there's there's uh false brothers that have crept in unawares and they they're bringing a false gospel to you and now you're lisening and you're putting up with that and why you were you were already under the school master and you graduated you already graduated because you've received the promise of the Spirit by faith amen you you have been placed as Sons so now you've been put positionally put into the place as sons and now you want to go back and say dear School master please help me please give me direction I need the school Master to come back that's you're you've already you've already entered into the position of sunship Amen why do you want to go back as Paul says to the weak and beggarly elements the law you're go you're going back to the law to try to assure yourself did you receive the Holy Spirit by The Works of the law or did you receive the Spirit by the the hearing of Faith amen and so the the answer to the question is is obvious they received it by the hearing of Faith they didn't receive it because well they got circumcised and they started following the law of Moses and now suddenly they have the Holy Spirit no Paul says actually those people that are telling you to go back to circumcision and the law they're just telling you you have to become a little baby again go back to Childhood you've already graduated you the father has taken you out done a ceremony over you and said your name on the check is just as good as mine amen he's given you the the Holy Ghost amen whereby you cry ABA father you've already received it why is it necessary now to go back to kindergarten don't go back to kinder Garten continue you know and this is what Paul this is the kind of the emphasis that Paul is having he's giving different examples and different things but the whole picture of the book of Galatians is that is that you have you you have entered into a relationship with God that's that is the fruition of what he did for Abraham amen you you've received the promise you've already the promise seed is Christ not the Jews amen Christ is the promised seed you've received that promised seed and through Christ you're all children of Abraham and of course you know throughout all of Paul's Epistles and especially the book of Galatians we understand God was always saving people by Faith No One kept the law with perfection did David keep the law of perfection I would say not a million miles from it so how was he saved by faith he how was he saved it was by faith the just shall live by faith that's habach that's not a new testament thing that's the whole thing Abraham was saved by faith even if they were following the law they never it was just proving they couldn't follow the law and it was merely a school Master to forward them to Christ the school Master can't make you a new creation the tutors and governors is training you so you can get to the place where you receive what you need to receive so when you receive what you need to receive you don't have to go backwards under the tutor anymore under the school Master anymore you've graduated the man the man that is the son of a property owner he of course the property owner is busy so he assigns a tutor to teach him and train him so that he understands what his position is so he can learn how to properly relate to those that he is to govern to to to to lead and to provide for and to manage right and so he's been tutored he's been trained and that's what the law is sent for even Paul alludes to that in Galatians 4 that even for the Gentiles the weak and beggarly El elements idolatry for them was even a school Master to lead them to Christ strange very strange that Paul puts it that way but he's saying why would you want to go back to what you were before when you've already re received the promise amen and that's a great danger even for Christians of of our day is that we can get so zealous for God we really have an experience with him he changes us but then we want to maintain our walk by The Works of the law and it becomes a stumbling block to us and to everyone around us it's only by faith amen many times we look we we miss that Faith produces fruit right how do I know if I really have faith how do I know if I'm I I really have the Holy Spirit always produces fruit that's what brother brandom said every time when brother when the Lord dealt with brother brandham and corrected him on what the evidence of the Holy Ghost is as you see and go through the different statements that the prophet makes it's believing the written word when it's Vindicated that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost well brother brandom how do I know if I have it it produces the same life that's what he says over and over and over again the evidence is not the production of the life that's the problem and that's where the mind of man goes to immediately well I've got I've got this and I've got that brother bham says nonsense they can out the the Pharisees can outdo you yeah Matthew 7 tells us that that can't be the evidence because they prophesied they cast out Devils they did many mighty works in the name of Jesus and Jesus said that's no evidence of anything it's the one that does the will of my father what's the will of the father believe on the one that he sent brother brandham in Christ is the mystery of God revealed says what is the new birth you'd say well brother brandom what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen see not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon amen amen what is what is what is first of all what is faith faith is a revelation so how do you let's let's dig a little further on that so how do you faith is more than merely a revelation because faith in in encapsulates also trust right you trust God you believe you take his word as it is and you believe it no matter what so you obtain Faith by spiritual Revelation amen so it's not your faith it's not you doing it it's not human Faith amen It's Supernatural faith is a gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast so how do I how do I obtain it God has to give it to you I can't give it to you I can preach brother Jason can preach 365 days a year and that can never give you the faith God has to sovereignly give it to you as a gift through his unmar favor so how do we know how do we know if we have faith I I think that's a that's an interesting question how do you know if you have faith you know you know there's a witness Amen in you isn't that what scripture says his Spirit Bears record with bears witness with our spirit that we are the sons of of God Amen and we don't go by feelings emotions experiences we go by what the word says the word has become everything to you right and you want to live that word with all your heart am amen and there's something inside of you that God is causing it to live besides your stupid choices and your mistakes and your failures something's rising up with you push in you forward that you can't control cuz salvation and the outworking of Salvation is a sovereign work of God we must absolutely make a choice we must surrender to that work you know it's it's work out your salvation with fear and trembling but that's not that's one verse the next verse tells us how we work out our salvation with fear and trembling it says because it is God that works in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure so if God is working in you to Will and to do of his good pleasure therefore you are going to work out your salvation with fear and trembling you working is a result of God working and ultimately it comes to there's something inside of you that's pushing you forward that's carrying you through that you're sure you're you're sure that in yourself I can't make it I can't do it I I won't survive that and somehow you're just walking walking and you're going forward and God is keeping you and he's strengthening you and he's using these difficulties and trials and horrible things that are happening and suddenly you're you're you're you're you're growing you're maturing you're strengthening it's it's it's an amazing thing that God does that uh truly you know we can we can understand the fact of it but we can't really understand what's exactly causing this to happen because most people other people happens to and suddenly they're none of it works and they're out in the world and it makes no sense and God didn't help me it's like I can't do anything but believe that's what God even Bes even besides my own doubts all I can do is believe brother bam says and who do you say this is is there any here that hasn't received the baptism of the spirit yet now you say brother brandom I tell you I shouted one time that's very good I spoke in tongues once that's very good too but still that ain't what I'm talking about how can you shout and speak in tongues and deny the word the evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing the word always been every age if you can receive the word amen in the sermon Shalom brother bam says how would you know what's right the manifestation of the spoken word of God being made manifest light of the hour certainly there is what the evidence of the holy spirit is believing the word of God when it's manifested he was the word manifested and some of them denied it laughed at it made fun of him called him a fortune teller some evil spirit there is evidence speaking in tongues there's evidence of the fruits the only evidence there is is when a man believe the written word when it's Vindicated walk in the light of it Jesus was the light of the hour because he was the promised word of the hour and tried to tell them so but they were too much in darkness to understand it so is it today now amen it isn't so much about initial evidences I think this this uh te Pentecostal teaching is sort of becomes a misnomer the initial evidence is more than just an initial evidence this is a continuous work of God in our lives you know brother brandham says in broken sisters but one day the Lord in a vision straightened me out and he said that the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word neither love nor speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word now we can go and say well what about this and and what about that and what about over uh here well I mean we can see it in the message we can see see it in the scripture what about all the exceptions that we have maybe the exceptions that we have in our brain to this are actually just manifestations of unbelief and that's problematic for all of us we have to go we have to go by what the word says not what our interpretations not the things that make us feel comfortable when Peter was speaking to Cornelius in the house of Cornelius and I when I see when I hear this and I see this I think back to what he says in the book of Galatians while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word amen we want to work ourselves up into something we want to we want to make sure that everybody sees that you know our services are the best Services what about producing people that believe the word regardless of what circumstances they are in I regard that personally as something far above great manifestations in the service I believe in manifestations in the service I believe in shouting I believe in dancing but if it's only that and that's our main focus and emphasis then we're not really preaching the word of the word of God for this age amen this only would I learn of you receive ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith it's as simple as that brothers and sisters do you believe the word yeah but I didn't do this and I didn't do that do you believe the word because we're saved by faith not by works not by outward demonstrations Christ saved us he accomplished the work it's faith in a finished work of Jesus Christ and the New Covenant is when the Holy Spirit comes into your life and changes you amen amen has that happen for you if that hasn't happened then get that if it produces emotions it might it might not but get the change get the transformation be regenerated be converted have a nature change that causes you to believe the word no matter what that's that's the emphasis that's what's important amen Galatians 3 3-5 are you so foolish having be done in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh have you suffered so many things in vain if it yet be in vain he therefore that ministereth the spirit to you and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith if you want to be healed you can be healed right now by faith I don't have to lay hands on you the pastor doesn't have you can just receive it you want to be saved just believe amen but but I got to come up and you got to lay hands on me and I got to shout no you don't maybe I'm a heretic that's fine call me a heretic but I believe the word of God no matter what man says about it and that's what Christians do 1 Corinthians 21:14 says the natural man receives not the things of the spirit of God for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned so only only a man that has been changed that has receive the Holy Spirit we're given the holy spirit so that we can know the things that are freely given to us by God that's what scripture says so the holy spirit is what comes to produce a spiritual Revelation in our hearts in the church age book brother bam says without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can never have your eyes open to a true spiritual revelation of the word a man without the spirit is blind to God and His truth so then Romans 10:17 so then Faith cometh by working yourself up into emotions oh whoops read it wrong so Faith then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen so I want to I want to tell you something I want to give you a secret you want to know how to grow in your walk with God hear the word of God with faith you want to grow more hear it more with faith amen it's not necessary to work yourself up God will take care of that just be open to God moving in your life but make sure it's always according to the word that's what the prophet instructed us every experience we judge it by the word but be open to the Holy Spirit moving in you but first approach him by faith don't think you have to work yourself into it to get healed to get saved to whatever it is that's not the gospel amen the gospel Comes To Us by faith Abraham was was justified by faith he's the father of us all he simply believed what God said he heard what God said he believed it and he was justified amen same thing applies for us and even the Holy Spirit receiving the Holy Spirit it isn't suddenly well you're saved by faith but then you got to work yourself into the Holy Spirit did you re this only will I learn of you are you so foolish Galatians did you receive the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith hearing of faith Jesus said no man can come to me I know there's more to that verse but I'm just stopping there so that you can catch the emphasis CU he says no man can come to me no man wants to come to him we don't seek God that's not how it works human nature turns away from God and rejects the word of God no man can come to me except the father draws him first so it's not us coming to God and then God suddenly giving us something but it's God by his Sovereign purpose drawing us to him first and it's in that drawing that God gives Faith amen and it's a gift it's a free gift it's not something we earned it's not something that we worked ourselves into so it is only by his grace he has given you Faith because you you know many people humanly believe in the great qualities of Jesus Christ many people humanly say this is this is right this is true they they grow up in church and they come to understand that Christianity is the truth but that's different than receiving the gift of faith that's different than God coming in and making a conversion experience in your life and that's only God can do that we can't save ourselves we can neither can we move God to change his mind and save us if you ever were saved you were saved before the foundation of the world am in Christ because Christ is the elect the one in who his his soul Delights he's the Beloved that we're accepted in so from from start to finish we have to understand that salvation is the Lord but it's God the god that makes us willing right but it's not of him that Wills not of him that willth or of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy oh yeah amen it's God's Sovereign choice of us it's not that God said well I like this jacob guy a little bit better and he seems like he's better actually by the eyes the eye test we're going with Esau wasn't by the eye test it was so that God the purpose of God according to election would stand Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated and so it was God's mercy that that draws us not our own will not our own choosing but God's choosing of us musicians if you come 1 John 51 says whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him right there you see the picture laid out perfectly how do we know if we're born of God by spiritual revelation we believe that Jesus is the Christ amen and then he next next thing that he goes right into is love right someone that's born of God loves amen so it's it's not is it us that loved him first no it's God that loved us first amen and that's why we love him amen let's pray father we we thank you Lord while we were still sinners alienated from you without you in that in that M of sin and and muck Lord you came to us you sought us you came right down in that muck and Meer and pulled us out Lord we're so thankful for that Lord we're so thankful for the faith that you've given

heart they want to share we want to give you the chance to do that anybody where is the mic there is the mic [Music] uh let's see okay I was just praying just now if I could tell this testimony actually um you know you guys all know I got re-baptized on Sunday and I'm just really really happy about that but I wanted to kind of go into a little bit of uh the cliff notes of what God is dealing with me about um I I texted brother Jason that you know through a Ser of series of Dreams and Nightmares and things like that and I had a uh a like a month or two ago I had a dream where everything was normal everything's good everybody you know all good to go um and I went to bed in my dream and this small little about the size of a seven-year-old kid comes running across AC cross my the foot of my bed and up the side and jumps on me and grabs my throat it was a greenish grayish figure and I grabbed it and I asked Esther in the dream I said I was screaming what is this what is this and as it jumped on me it said are you ready for the comeback no I don't want none of that I you know and I couldn't I couldn't see it in my dream I couldn't tell what it was and it was just this nasty thing while I you know woke my myself up and just bothered me and I went throughout the house and just kind of claimed the name of Jesus over everything and rebuked that and everything it stood with so just let it go didn't think of anything of it really but uh Saturday night this last Saturday it was just something was just wrong something was grieving my spirit really really badly and I just kind of started thinking about that again and you know went to bed thinking whatever um well Saturday night had another dream where it was just a horrible horrible feeling of where you're watching your life kind of you're watching your life through your eyes but you're not living in your life and I had felt amazing you know being in this church and being everywhere just growing in the word and everything but I never had that moment where it was like that's where I got to make my stand um well in this dream you know a whole bunch of stuff happens and everything like that and I'm just feeling so depressed and anxious and in the dream very suicidal and stuff like that well something happens in the dream and it clicks it said are you ready for the comeback and I had dealt with you know massive depression suicide stuff that you know throughout 145 to about 19 or something like that and then got got delivered of it well when that thing said are you ready for the comeback that's what that was and I can tell now it's like I understand what Spirit I'm dealing with so I knowing what spirit I just felt total power over it and you know leave me alone leave my family alone you're done we're done so woke up again woke myself up again and just started kind of balling my eyes out and just praying and you know thanking God for it and immediately after that it was just such a heavy burden to get re-baptized and it it felt like something in my mind said get re-baptized because that was a struggle with me you know brother Jason kind of went into that is what are the people going to think what are you know oh he just just now got it it's like no I've had this for a little bit and I'm living this life and there's no going back but I I never had that moment so I told God I was like well if you want me to get re-baptized just tell me what I just did so go go do it so it's like man I couldn't couldn't help myself I texted my dad and I texted brother Jason and if we weren't able to do it Sunday we were going to get it done Sunday so there was not really a whole lot of negotiating there nice but just want to praise the Lord and thank him for everything's done in my life my family so praise the Lord hallelujah [Applause] yeah I just want to add to that that had I had I not had good Brothers to lean on I'm preparing for the service and he he wanted I mean he was not going to wait
