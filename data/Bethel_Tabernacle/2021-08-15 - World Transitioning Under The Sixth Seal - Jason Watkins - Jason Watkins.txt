you lord yes lord [Music] as you show your face we'll see your glory will cease [Music] amen what a nice song brother can you give the lord a hand this morning amen that is quite beautiful man in greece in the name of the lord this morning happy to have you can be seated momentarily i just want to make a couple of announcements before we get started in the word this morning so um for those of you who may not know um you may all know but wanted to give you an update at the nonetheless and then i think we want to have some special prayer for your mom and dad what's the latest this morning trav so just still symptomatic amen uh my sister's baby sister sherry also is very sick we got uh just uh found out about that this morning and uh if it's if it is coveted it'll be actually her third round my so i don't know uh maybe she has a susceptibility to it but i sure feel sorry for her this morning they don't know they haven't confirmed that as far as i know but um still need to pray amen to pray for all of god's family and thank the lord we've heard some good reports recently of some people recovering had a very good friend in south africa brother hendrick and uh streams these services and i can hardly get out of the pulpit and get to my back office and i've already got an email brother jason and you know and they're they're streaming at near midnight so just rejoicing over the word his family there and so i i got an announcement from a brother over there i'm not sure i know him if i've met him i don't remember although his his photo looked familiar but uh brother hendrick and his entire family brother hendrick was in the hospital not doing good and i was just praying for who wouldn't have it and for him and the whole family and then i began to hear well he's a little better today and pray that much harder i'll tell you something friends prayer changes everything it doesn't just change things it changes everything amen and so i was glad to get a good report there that he's pretty much recovered and the family's recovered he's still having some breathing it's not quite what it was so i told him hey we're praying that kind of a prayer for a brother in our church amen so we're going to pray for brother joe and pray for brother hendrick over there in south africa to see full lung capacity return praise the lord amen and then brother jim babb i heard was doing better so we were really praying hard for that one too amen his family wife i think sent me an uh a note to say you know um you know we love him and and i said i'm sending this to you because i know you love me i wrote it back i said good grief sister the whole world loves brother jim amen he's uh well known around the world because of the ministry there at happy valley and uh brother jim is an awesome awesome awesome man so praise the lord we want to go to prayer about those in just in a moment but we have a missionary work that we're going to do it's a missionary outreach for for those of you who don't know my mom and dad for years had been communicating with uh native tribal people from the cherokee nation up from where my dad was born and raised his whole young manhood and my dad claims which we've never dna tested i don't think but my dad would know his family claimed for years that they had cherokee in their blood and that would make sense historically since my dad's uh the watkins came from the highlands of scotland and when they came ashore in the colonies colonists didn't like them can you imagine not liking somebody like brother eddie they didn't like them and so the the scots just kept going west you know and they settled the appalachian mountains and so that's where my heritage is from and so it wouldn't be unusual at all to have inner marriage there among the cherokee nation there but that that's almost a minor point but compared especially to the point i want to get to momentarily but they have been my dad and it was his heart's desire to see some work start up there and my mom has carried on amen that missionary work amen and she's actually after a long time and it just looked like it was just nothing remaining of any communication and just when she was almost ready to give it up suddenly she gets a communication and they had lost your contact info mom and uh and they wanted more books and so here we go again amen so we're gonna we're actually gonna go up there and it's not the first time it's happened they had some meetings up there uh and but not kind of not with the emphasis that i have on my heart i want to carry on that i don't know about long term carrying it on but i want to fulfill a burning in my heart to go up there and hold some outreach meetings and aiming it at the cherokee nation and my message to them is quite simple you know how how is it that you're unaware cherokee indian nation how is it that you're unaware that a prophet rose up from among your own people and you don't even know about him and i even hear i know about him and you don't know about him and how is it that you don't know it's because the denominations who control you for a hundred years have kept it from you and but but this is this is a prophet whose grandmother came right off the reservation she was full-blooded cherokee and so you know i you know they if they ask me why why did he never come to us i'll say well you never invited him he went to the apaches and many great miracles were done on those reservations and brother branham says quite a bit about in defense of his native countrymen and us particularly the cherokee nation and says that he uh maybe because they're his people and so that's that's just burning in my heart i have how i have a hard time putting it in words it's just burning on my heart um to take to them and say and so we've actually made some contact already there's one brother who's um he's baptist but he's proven to be open to the word and the chief i don't know we don't know but uh we're we're going to go up there september 17th and 19th and uh and on saturday there will be a picnic with a gospel singing followed by a cherokee bonfire that's something they do as a tribal nation there and um a tribal bonfire at the um okinawa fee olive tea i think that ocana lufty thanks sister mom uh park there amen sunday morning we plan to have an outdoor service whether permitting we're going to make a provision if we have to go indoors and so it was on sister jean's heart to also do a clothing drive for the natives native americans there brother branham called them real americans primarily for children and ladies dresses and shoes but will accept all clothing in good condition with no stains and i want to emphasize good clothing don't send the stuff up there that you're ready to send to the landfill and uh you know maybe maybe go out and buy buy something new to send up there but if you've got something in good condition you don't wear it anymore and it's not stained up and not worn out then we'll take it up there and distribute it i don't know friends we might get one shot at this uh by the time i finish preaching because i intend to not pull any punches i intend to just declare openly what god has done in this day and i'm even going to offer to pray for their sick because i'm going to tell you in missionary work around the world in my life i've seen god do a special thing and it's scriptural it is scriptural in antioch the bible said god did special miracles special miracles because it was being introduced there brand new and uh i remember years ago brother lonnie when we were in the mission field there in in the in the russia and the ukraine and belarus and places and it was all brand new because the iron curtain had just collapsed and we were going back in for some of the first time with the message of the hour and brother lonnie said be on beyond be prepared because he said when when something goes into a new area where it's never been and they start receiving it he said god will start doing special things that he wouldn't normally do but he'll do special things and i realized that was scriptural and i've seen that happen i remember meetings there in russia right in moscow when we were taking the gospel there for some of the very first time and i mean i saw blinded eyes opened i saw epileptic children demons cast off of them with just a simple prayer and be completely delivered i saw a tremendous power of god moving i saw people at the preaching of the gospel being healed right while they're not even being prayed for just preaching to them and they were believing standing up healed got the testimonies from the pastor coming after the meeting took me said hey people were this brother this sister over here young people being baptized with the holy ghost right in their seat amen people coming in off the streets and dropping down to the floor surrendering their life to the lord and tremendous deliverance taking place so you know i intend to to put it to the to the challenge not arrogantly but just to say god keeps his word amen and so i i plan to go with great expectation offer to pray for their sick and take them these uh clothing and preach the gospel to them and if we only get one shot at it and we never get invited back then so be it but we did our duty amen and i've i've i feel that i have um you know met that uh continuation and who knows what god could do friends we're close to the end god could do something amazing in the cherokee nation there's never been a church among them there's never been an outbreak of the message and i would know believe me that's where i'm from and my whole family and we've known all that for years and so uh brother eddie always had a desire to see the word of god break out in his old home ground amen so we're going to do that on september 17-19 and i'm going to go up at least myself brother george may accompany me and we're going to reconnoiter the recognitor i guess the marines would say do a kind of a recon on the area i want to i want to i actually want to go and and run some ads in the paper and figure out an internet facebook presence maybe some way to get through social media i may even meet maybe even going to have some posters blown up of the of the brother branham there in the houston texas picture with the pillar of fire over his head because that's an inarguable scientifically proven uh supernatural being you notice they even the the ding-dongs who try to argue over everything else don't argue that because they can't because it's right i've been in washington dc i've seen it and uh and you have to actually get special arrangements to see it because it's part of the national archive and so they've proven that that was a supernatural being amen so so we're going to use that one and uh and and be able to say some things very directly about what god has done in this hour amen so just have that on your mind and um and if you uh please see as far as clothing see sister jean or brother george or sister andrea with your donations and and we're gonna we'll make sure that those get all up there and if you want to come along come along uh but if we only have a handful that'll be fine too so september 17 and 19. amen let's stand and go to prayer for brother donald and sister elaine and my wife's uh kids sister sherry amen and just believe that the lord will move on the scene and we'll uh get ready to turn to the word just uh give me some of course sister deborah of your choosing let's bow our heads father we thank you for your word we thank you for the realities of the living god lord now we stand here this morning with sick people dear ones to us loved ones family members lord and we would so love to see them here today healthy lord and raising their hands but father the enemy has them under attack right now lord our precious brother donald and sister elaine battling this sickness lord we we condemn the works of the enemy lord let us never never hesitate to condemn satan in the name of jesus father we of course we know you do all things sovereignly and there no one's going to stop your hand or stay your hand that's not it that's not even my business my business is to not let the devil do something and get away with it because he's a straight up trespasser lord he has no rights and you said i would that you be in health so father when a man asked you lord if thou wills thou can make me whole and you gave him the answer you always gave consistently you were always willing you said i will be thou hold it was always your will for your children to receive healing so father i pray now for them today we condemn the work of the enemy we rebuke him in the name of the lord jesus christ and may with that they be well we call for their deliverance lord for my wife's sister sherry may you have mercy on that case lord god under the inheritance lord of her older sister may lord we stand on that claim and ask father in the name of jesus that should be made well and that you spare her at this hour we commit ourselves into your hands lord that you've seen the the burden that's upon my heart today lord coming to this service and it's been a busy day of preaching and teaching since early morning hours lord this now my third time to open the word today and father i i i'm asking for you lord to take and open the word and break it to us many things i could say plenty of notes laying before me but i i just feel in my heart lord that i i don't want to put you in a box i want to try to get to the burden of the word for the people that's on my heart now clarify that lord make it crystal clear and father give us the path to take this morning we commit ourselves we humble ourselves before you in jesus name committing it all to you in jesus name amen amen praise the lord friends god bless you this morning we're going to turn to revelation chapter 7 this morning revelation chapter 7. and we've looking as as we said to you this morning on the church-wide notice board the chat board i want to take a title this morning world transitioning under the sixth seal and i i want to strive today to take a very something that's been very profound to me and bring you up to speed on where we're at and what we're doing i think that it is paramount that we see god clearly what he's doing right now not even what he's doing last month what he's doing right now and amen and so we want to see that make that very clear incidentally before we read i meant to make a follow-up comment and i'll just do that just now brother matt was speaking to you and kind of updating you here last weekend while we were in louisiana concerning the building project i'm sure you can see the hard work that's been done i love the effect of these larger windows and so we've got a lot we're still doing outside to the church to the fellowship hall to the front we're still those doors they're going to be replaced or are upgraded to some in some way and we've also got plans for the inside here we want to um take out this ceiling and raise it and vault it up and have exposed beams and uh change the a lot of things that we're transitioning through um for over the next you know into the fall probably take us so what we're going to do is is we're going to put a special link uh we don't have it today it's not up it might be up later tonight but we're going to put a special uh link i know most of you use paypal already sending in tizen offerings and missions and youth and things like that but we're going to put a special link on the on our homepage for our building fund so that it's easy peasy you can click straight on that make a donation and because it comes through that link it will automatically go in the building fund so it's a really streamlined uh for the church books and that way it's uh you don't have to worry about labeling it so use that link and that's where it goes and so we we hope that you can see what's going on and become a little excited about what we want to do going forward and we'll have more to say on that in coming weeks and months amen but we sure are happy for the progress we won't have any work going on here this week i will pick up again and resume the following week amen so let's look at our scripture in revelation chapter seven and we're taking this title world transitioning under the sixth seal and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given excuse me to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither does neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed a hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel and from there he goes down naming the twelve tribes amen we won't need to read that let's pray father we thank you for your word now blessed in jesus name amen god bless you can be seated amen when last we were ministering we ministered about changing times and we talked about you know the tendency of stagnation to come into people's lives and that is exceptionally deadly i i could almost not overstate to you the importance of not be not allowing your life to become like a stagnant pool of water we made the statement and of course it's scripture we understand clearly that you say well still still water runs deep and david said though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death and he leadeth me besides still waters we get that but but that scriptural still water is deep water that's being surfaced by an active artesian well underneath it so it's not a stagnant pond you understand it's being fed and it and it has a current and it has a flow it might be still sometimes it can be rolling quite a lot depending on what rains have happened in the mountains and it comes down and fills up the underground aquifers and then sometimes you can find an artesian as brother branham described his artesian well and called it bubbling or rolling or churning and then there's times where even that artesian well i've been there and there's times where it's very still yet you can still see a flow you can still see that it's not a stagnant pond and it's very cold water coming from deep within the earth and irrigating the farmlands out and about so you don't want to become a stagnation we realize that that that's not uh you know what god has for his family and so we realized then that that that while there are life forms i remember making this statement last time while there are life forms nature finds a way i mean it's amazing where nature has life living and thr and and even in stagnant ponds there's different kinds of life form i grant that but my point is that that's not the believer that's not where you're supposed to live that's not an environment you're supposed to live in you're supposed to live like you know that seven colored rainbow trout that that guy needs fresh moving water and eagles need high soaring altitudes and i'm here to tell you something friends don't let the devil plague you down with stuff wait your mind down we were talking about in the sunday school class this morning about you know uh everything everything that we touch and this is such an important point to make especially to young people people and young men i'm not just talking about little small teenagers i'm talking about young men and young women you know our upper teens early 20s mid 20s making their plans setting their pathway for life and and naturally we there's nothing wrong with education or career or or you know providing for your needs and and pay paying bills and having a family of course we have all of these things paul said that we can't go out of the world we do live here we do need to make provision and there's nothing wrong in that but just so that you understand who's in control of all of that stuff that's the real key is that we understand that it's all part of satan's eden and and as such satan has it designed i promise you he has it designed to draw away draw away your mind and your heart uh unto worldly things and i don't just mean sinful things i mean just the pursuit of education the pursuit of a career the pursuit of wealth the pursuit of happiness say i need to be happy sure fine be happy but understand that you have a thirst given to you by god and that thirst is only ever going to be really satisfied here that that that trying to find your satisfaction in life by chasing a better career or higher education or a bigger bank account that is an exercise in futility i wish i had it here this morning i well i probably wouldn't show it but i thought about using it for uh a youth meeting coming up and and it's not hard to find that there there have there i i was looking at uh i don't know who made it some christian organization and they just went on the streets and they they they kind of had access to some of the uh the most uh renowned hollywood stars and sports stars i'd start naming them you'd recognize them and and and political uh and wealthy people and i mean the these are the people who are on the red carpets who roll up in the bentleys who you know who have multi-million dollar contracts for bouncing a basketball or catching something in the end zone and they and they went around interviewing they must have interviewed 50 of them top pop singers and rap singers and some of the world's what they call elite and they just had a simple question for them just a very simple straightforward question said can money give you happiness and you can see the pop star the rap star the sports star the movie star the the the political star they're almost taken back by the question but somehow they're able to get an honest response and every one of them to a man or a woman not one of them said oh sure money can buy you happiness they all uniformly thought and reflected for a moment and said no what about your fame no it can't it can't get you happiness no it can't and they were just all honest here's the people they're the elite they've got everything that everybody's chasing and they're looking at a camera saying no it can't it can't bring happiness one of them was honest enough to say money can buy you pleasures but happiness no are you happy not always see and so you have to understand friends sometimes it's necessary for the word of god to pull the veil away that satan tries to veil your eyes and cover your perspective i remember years ago in the 1970s and 80s oh my the the the marlboro man on the bo on the billboards now thankfully they've limited a lot of those cigarette ads they can't do them like they used to anymore but back in the day when i was a teenager my every every guy that was like the coolest dude that was like man he was the he was like man that's a real man everybody wanted to be the marlboro man you know he just he just looked tough he just looked strong and but and and those posters were in magazines and on the streets and on television and when they could do those kinds of ad on television but what they never showed to this day you won't find any ads of that man in that picture laying in a hospital bed skin and bones stage four lung cancer wasted away till he just looked like a skeleton of a man and died in agony they'll show you these models and they'll put them up there and all their beauty and their max factor and it's all fake anyway and and and that but they what they'll never show you sister is that same exact model years later when her health is gone and her youth is gone and her she's broken down and alone and and and and tragic and taking their own life and committing suicide i'm here to tell you there is no contentment possible outside of god's word and the world is in such a a state of collapse and and catastrophe i'm here to tell you something friends when when the lord descended from heaven and brought an open book to a prophet the mighty angel christ he found the earth in a catastrophe you are living in that hour where where brother branham i was showing the sunday school class this morning all civilizations of the devil he runs it all all education all science all politics social issues whatever it is i just just know this that satan is at the helm of it and they asked brother branham will we have that that this kind of a civilization in heaven he says no but we will have a civilization but it'll be so far above this civilization friends don't don't miss heaven for the world i wouldn't miss heaven for the world would you amen i'm here to tell you something friends god offers us a bright future and and the world is transitioning nature is transitioning i made this statement last time i want to make it again that that catastrophic change people who don't like change i'm here to tell you catastrophic change is rushing to meet us and the only path for the believer is up that's the only path sometimes we find ourselves more inclined or at least let me say it is my hope or let me say we need to be finding ourselves more inclined to up amen i'm not looking so much to go forward with career and education fortune and glory fortune and fame i'm looking to go up hallelujah i've set my destination i know that i am one upon whom the ends of the world have come and brother branham made that challenge there into whom would we go what a question to what a title for a sermon to whom would we go what a what a paralyzing question i think sometimes you know brother branham i remember brother eddie told me years ago that he was walking through the living room and and just you know i don't know on his way to the coffee maker or wherever and he said he just walked by and looked down as he's walking by and there was a book what shall i do with jesus called the christ and he said it literally just turned him and he said oh whoa whoa whoa wait a minute what shall i do whoa wait a minute he picked it up and suddenly it was more than a title the lord was saying now ask yourself what shall i know what brother branham did with him i know what the apostles did i know what pilate did i know what the jews did that's not in question but what shall i do with jesus called the christ there's a question that you need to ask yourself today what shall i do because brother branham said his blood is on your hands and i'm here to tell you the world is passing away and nobody can stop it and a rapture is coming and nothing can stop it and a people are leaving and nothing can stop it hallelujah and people are going to die and nothing can stop it the world is being destroyed it's transitioning and nothing can stop it it's irreversible it's irrevocable nobody's going to undo that i'm here to tell you catastrophic change is rushing to meet you make whatever plans you want but catastrophic change is rushing to meet us what are your plans for that brother branham talked about christ being the eternal achievement i'm sure you remember from last time he is the eternal achievement there is no other place you could go or anything you could do that you could achieve that would be everlasting outside of jesus christ we find that you know this message is astonishing in that you know when you when you realize what god has opened up to us in his word do you realize how privileged you are to understand that the world by and large looks at the seven seals and the four horsemen and all of these things and oh wow the antichrist and the four horsemen and the false prophet and the seals and it's all coming and we need to be ready and and here's a prophet who comes out of a little room from that pillar of fire the same one over his head in houston texas and he comes to the pulp and he says actually it's already in the past first seal's history what about the second one history what the third one history you know it's already happened without the first trumpet history second history third history fourth recent history fifth yeah six oh yeah seventh you better believe it fourth seal you're living in it right now see you're living in the fourth under the fourth seal with a seventh seal message because what was the seventh seal message it was the unveiling of the mighty god and when he and when god was unsealed it unsealed his family it unsealed you did you know you had a seal on your life that the holy ghost had to unseal you to give you the kind of life that god saw that's the life i want i want the life my constant prayer for me for my family for you for your family lord bring us closer today this day bring me a little closer to the image that you saw of me before the foundation of the world that doesn't happen by accident that's something that has to be purposed in your life you have to pursue that we're saying to the sunday school class this morning you have to roll up your sleeves you have to gear up your mind you have to gird up your loins you have to get ready because a grace was prophesied to come but you have to be ready to receive it this isn't disney world this isn't you know santa claus this isn't somebody just giving you a gift this is god giving you an opportunity what are you gonna do with the message of the seventh seal i'm here to tell you that it's not just about mysteries people you know people look i i remember you know when you talk when you talk about the sixth seal and and any student of the message would go yeah the six seals tribulation and you you almost find yourself i remember a preacher years ago preaching and at the time i was a young man didn't fully understand what he meant by it i do now but he said you know he said some people say oh the six what's sixth seal said oh it's a tribulation he said where'd you get that and even when i heard that i went uh brother branham maybe not in the the six seals tribulation period but the sixth seal is so much more than that the sixth seal is a whole chain of events that's happening we read today about how that during the tribulation period 144 000 jews are called and they're part of the elect family you know how that happens you know why that happens because the message of the seventh seal under an eagle anointing when you leave here that eagle anointing lifts up and flies east and picks up two more prophets picks up moses and elijah and takes this very message that you believe and that the world scorns and takes this very message to 144 000 elected hebrews who are true hebrews they receive it they become believers they they they have suddenly they have they go from having a jewish synagogue to a message church hallelujah and the power of god breaks upon them and those prophets and and they they have control over nature and the world hates them see that's what i say i thought they're the trumpet was to the jews sure the trump the trumpets gather the jews but that that's just a gathering trumpet but the message that they receive the message they receive is the mighty god unveiled they find out that jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new and that you know what that revelation does to them it puts the seal of god in their forehead and the bible says that's how you're sealed the only one who can seal is the holy ghost amen and so what how did you get sealed because the holy ghost unveiled himself to you and interpreted his word to you and you became a believer and you're sealed into the kingdom you're escaping destruction the 144 thousand die as martyrs they have to because of the purging of israel so great is this message we were showing this morning i don't mean to keep just rehearsing points we made in sunday school but although it's very relevant but we were rehearsing how that brother branham says there's a remnant in every age all the way back to the old testament and you find that because i don't have time to teach on it this morning i was teaching on it on my uh bible study uh call-in show this morning early this morning and and just breaking that down for those brothers but if you if you go back and you look at uh this passage in chapter 7 of revelation you find dan and ephraim missing and why why were they missing because their names were blotted out as a tribe blotted out from under heaven brother branham brings that out in the sixth seal their names are blotted out why because of idolatry because they didn't heed the message of their prophets starting with moses and they just kept they kept into idolatry and there's where jeroboam remember the kingdom divided and jeroboam took 10 tribes and and and and and then here you have rehoboam the son of solomon who keeps two tribes and and and to keep the people from coming to jerusalem to worship jeroboam says okay i will build calves and i'll put them one in den and i'll put one over here and and he was jeroboam was actually in ephraim and he's going to put one there and one in dan and he says now it's too hard for you to go life's too busy you got too much on your plate you know you got children in school and careers you can't always i mean going to church needs to be as easy as we can make it okay and if there's any struggle at all just don't worry about it we've got an alternative way you can go and you know you know what that was a perfect type of what would happen in the new testament the bible says they would heed to themselves teachers having itching ears who would tell them what they wanted to hear people believe what they want to believe and when a false king come along telling them you don't need you don't need to assemble yourselves as you see the day approaching come on you can just go to church on the internet it won't matter amen i'm gonna keep going it regardless you might as well say a man old me jump up walk out run out gay man give me an amen or something amen but it's true that those types paul said those are for our examples well i shouldn't i shouldn't go back there and pull that out it's for our examples see they they gave them a a convenient gospel and because those people wanted a convenient gospel people want that today they want a convenient gospel they don't really want to change their lives they don't want the gospel they don't mind the idea of christianity but don't make it impact my life in any way i just want to hold up a sign that says i'm a methodist baptist presbyterian i'm part of a club you know and i'm going to tell you something friends here here's something that i have come to believe more and more and more to it's becoming in me almost uh a burning to to say and i get we still witness with wisdom always use wisdom always be prayerful there are some times this might shock you there are some people say i need to go witness to him and god might not want you to do that at all not at all be led the sons of god are led by the spirit of god a lot of times jesus had opportunities to set the record straight and he's walked off yeah they even even could have corrected their errors a very simple error about his about his about where he was born and they're standing there and here's they're deciding their soul the fate of their soul whether they're going to have eternal life or be destroyed you'd say what could be more important than that and it's all hinging on he can't be the messiah because the scriptures say you know that he he's born in bethlehem and uh we know that this man's from galilee so no he can't be and jesus standing there could have swept well okay here listen here's my card actually i was there was a you're just misunderstanding i actually was born in bethlehem but then the king tried to kill me so my daddy took me to egypt and i came back to you know in the galilean but actually was born in bethlehem he could he could have fixed that he could have fixed that you know what he just he just let him think it and walked away you know why because he only did that which the father showed him to do but i'm going to tell you something friends it with wisdom i think that that one of the things that that becomes is becoming more and more incumbent upon me at least maybe it's just me feeling it if you want to adopt it fine but i'm to the point to where here i'm in possession of one of the greatest mystery secrets that the world is completely blind to and are going to get blindsided by and i happen to know the answer that denominationalism will lead you to the mark of the beast and doom you and i happen to know that by the bible and i've got people who you witness to and say are you a christian oh yeah i'm a methodist oh i'm a baptist i'm president i'm episcopal i'm this i'm catholic i'm whatever and how is it that that i mean surely at that moment to say friend friend i'm not speaking of you i'm not speaking of the people in your organization i'm sure it's full of good people i god's got an unwise virgin that are sanctified holy righteous people i get it heaven's gonna have more in it than just bride i get it not in the royal city but throughout heaven amen so i get that i understand that but why would i not take that friend and say but listen friend i'm talking about organizationalism i'm talking about your pastor your mama your people you i'm saying that according to the bible friend friend according to the bible do you not know that organized religion will lead you to the image and when you go to the image you'll take the mark do you not know that organized religion is the pathway for that do you not know that denominationalism is a blasphemous name taken from the mother of harlots amen i mean they may never speak to you again but how could you sit on that kind of information how can we in this community with wisdom and leadership but not take an opportunity to express that i i'm not billy graham i'm not going to cherokee nation to give them a billy graham outreach meeting they've had that that they've got that already i'm gonna tell them a prophet has come on the scene god has re has has made his word alive and has manifested what he promised and it is this message that will take a people and give them rapturing faith and take them in the rapture out of this world how could i sit on that kind of information with wisdom with love see so so we find that that the sixth seal is is so much more brother branham if you haven't heard a good tape in a while go listen to the sixth seal and there's no problem with just jumping the first five you should listen to all of them but if you just want to listen to one go listen that sixth seal i tell you yesterday i was driving around on my lawnmower and just trying to mow and i'd have to stop and raise my hands and cry and praise god and not just i almost couldn't take it it's so glorious and especially when it comes down to you and say oh it must be a terrible it's the end of the world man you're going to die it's not about that at all brother branham is trying to instruct the world hey you don't have to be destroyed there's a way to escape it there's a way out good news good news there's a way to the way to escape it i'm not here to judge everybody i'm not why do i why do i need to do that i'm here to give you the gospel the good news see it and and and that you're you're in a denomination it's not good news that you are mistakenly thinking you're okay mistakingly thinking you're a christian when according to the bible i know you're not that's not good and and and i need to give you the good news of the real gospel that it can change your life and it has power in the blood and it has authority over demons and it has it sets up leadership in homes and it restores marriages and saves young people raises the dead heals the sick this is the gospel we believe today this is the gospel i defend and challenge the world to say how show me where we're not doing the very works of jesus christ that's what it came for that's what it's to accomplish brother branham made us such a statement and boy my time is zooming by uh so i want to in case i don't get to it let me get you these couple of quotes here in case i miss them brother branham says in the way back i love this and this is relevant today because we're you know with covet and vaccine the whole question vaccine question and brother branham says the way back he says now we find out that when a man tries to find a serum a doctor you know to to to give to his patient to inoculate him you know don't don't think of the doctor in your doctors think of sister ruth like what her career is these these research doctors and and and to she and so he says to give his patient a serum to inoculate him from sickness he first tries it on a guinea pig and see if it'll work but god didn't do that see he never took a guinea pig he used it on himself see a good doctor wants to try a serum if he don't know whether it'll kill or cure he ought to take it himself first see if he don't know if it's going to kill somebody uh well don't give it to somebody and if you if you don't know if it's going to kill them take it yourself and see if you're a real doctor see if you're that determined see and so he says and uh before he puts it in somebody else and god in order to take this serum had to be made flesh and dwell among us a kinsmen redeemer god had to become a man so he could take the serum and he had to love this he had his inoculation at jordan now you remember when he come to jordan that's where he received the holy ghost now not for the new birth he didn't he wasn't born in sin but to empower his ministry okay he didn't need it like you needed you need it for empowerment and for a new birth to have your nature change he didn't need it for that reason but it's it's to empower his ministry to legitimize his ministry because that's that's he's the prototype for a brand new kind of person you understand jesus is the beginning of the creation of god he's a brand new kind of person he's the prototype for the whole family coming after him there will come a day he said i'll take away that stony heart that law on tables of stone no no no we're gonna i'm gonna go down into your heart and take out that fallen nature and i'm gonna give you a heart of flesh and i'm gonna cause you to keep my statutes oh i'm so glad he has that kind of power to change my desires yeah i still fight in the flesh sure i still struggle sure i still stumble but i also get back up after i go to prayer i get back up and i go forward again and guess what happens if he knocks me down again tomorrow i i go to prayer and then i get back up again we read a quote here to the class this morning that because of what god done god forgets your sin as though you never did it in the first place say why would god forget my sin because i said i said you know people believe what they want to believe everybody knows that people believe what they want to even tell them what they want to believe they'll believe it and man that's how con men work they figure out what the person wants and they tell them a lie say why does why does god do that god forgets what he wants to forget and he looks at the stumblings of my life and i desire to forget it he desires to forget it i confess it to him he forgives it it's gone from his memory never to be held against me anymore i'm completely free oh i do you avail yourselves of his new mercies every morning friends do you know that every morning every morning his mercies are brand new you can just roll around in it the next day hallelujah if the first if the previous night didn't turn out so good don't worry joy comes in the morning hallelujah oh i'm so glad and brother branham said he says now he had his inoculation at jordan when he walked out in the river by john was baptized and then the inoculation come down the toxin fell from heaven i like that one the toxin fell from heaven sister ruth wouldn't normally think of toxin as being a good thing but if it's a heavenly toxin amen the toxin fell from heaven like a dove saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell he was inoculated now watch watch this he was inoculated but now watch before you jump up and shout and immediately after the inoculation come the test and every man he immediately went into the wilderness and was tested and tempted and every man as soon as you receive the holy ghost and become inoculated every demon out of hell will turn against you that's quite a bit every demon out of hell will turn we're not talking about the 200 million at euphrates we're talking about every demon out of hell say who hates me a bunch every demon out of hell will turn against you even your own family sometimes will turn you down your husband your wife your pastor you're kicked out of a church you're laughed at and made fun of it's the test see but he goes on to say the inoculation held and that and i want to tell you something friends that inoculation held all the way to calvary there was no test however severe that could upend him why because he was inoculated the scripture had said i have come to do thy will oh lord i've come to do all thy will i will not shrink on any part of thy will that's my testimony that should be your testimony to say you know and i'm here to tell you sometimes you you can feel faint like you're not going to make it you're inoculated hallelujah you've got the toxin don't worry it's stronger than anything the devil can do i don't care if it gives you a fever and you get sick and spiritual sickness sets in don't worry this thing will take you all the way home this thing will it'll surmount every obstacle it'll take you through every fear through every valley over every mountain it will bring me home to my father because the inoculation came down from my father amen and it held him all the way i love this he says here oh he says it wasn't so from the beginning that one was the way back here it isn't so from the beginning i'm i'm rushing to close this watch if god poured out the holy ghost on the people at pentecost and that was his decision that how that the church must operate under the power of the holy spirit he cannot change that he cannot turn it over and say well i'll give it to a bishop i can do give it to this or give it to that he's got to still remain with the same decision and if the church on the day of pentecost received the baptism of the holy ghost and the reaction that came from that baptism of the holy ghost will be the reaction on every person that ever receives the baptism of the holy ghost see it's a medicine if it's supposed to work watch this if it's supposed to work and operates on a certain person makes them act a certain way the next person takes a takes that it takes a hold of will have to act the same way for inoculation that's the way it is with the holy spirit with god his words are perfect he is infinite this friends is the power that we need at this time i'm here to tell you something that is the kind of power that's not just words on a quote this is describing a necessary element that better be in your life and husbands and wives and dads and moms and young people and preachers and deacons and trustees it better be in all of our lives because you're living in the complete total collapse of humanity humanity is in its last throws it's living out its last days the world the earth is suffering its last elements of man in a fallen condition and the earth is groaning for change brother branham deals with that he says you go back in the book of isaiah you you see all of these you see all of these uh terrible things of nature and earthquakes and volcanoes and typhoons and hurricanes and tornadoes and and nature in a revolt brother branham goes back to isaiah and proves it's it's the earth almost like a living being the earth trying to renew itself brother branham says it's trying to rid itself of man say oh all these thousands of people died the earth is behind that the earth is trying to get rid of sin it's groaning waiting for the adoption of sons of god someday we'll walk back on it again in the perfect paradises of god oh the future that lays just before us friends my there's such a power here what a challenge that's the challenge i want to give to the cherokee nation that's what i want to tell them and prove that god will will keep his word amen amen brother branham makes a statement in the sixth seal and i've just got these last two things and i'll hit them and we'll we'll pack it up brother adam is going to make a point and i'll read it for you here that people from the from the standpoint of human nature that they love living in the past they love they love that but but when it comes to religion no they don't want the past they want they want the modern and it's like weird it's like wha what's up with that he says here see now what what well i'm gonna tell you what proves it i'll cut to the chase a little bit and tell you what proves it it proves that demon power is operating the religions of the world it proves that all religion outside of god's word is controlled by the enemy because that that doesn't make sense you remember how i've i've taught you how that one of the ways you can know demonic influence is it'll cause you to do things that don't make sense and it's just like upside down like that doesn't even make common sense you're doing that you know i i remember speaking to a good friend of mine and you know here he is all these years and preaching the message of the hour and knows by the bible knows by the bible knows by the bible no longer believes in the prophet fine that's fine but he knows by the bible who the of revelation is he knows by the scriptures that denominationalism is leading people to the mark of the beast he knows what the image to the beast is he knows the number of her name he knows the blood of the martyrs are under her skirts and he knows who it is he knows jehovah's witness is a cult he knows mormonism is a cult he knows that by the scriptures and spends hours and weeks and months getting online attacking a message and a messenger who he also knows was a good man and he also knows was an honest decent man and he also knows the message produces godly people and he knows it he can't even deny it we are the evidence of it we are the evidence did you know that you're the evidence that this word is true because if we get an original word it should produce an original life and he knows that and i just ask him very his good friend still is and i just said buddy i said you don't realize you're under the control of a demon and he goes wow i can't believe you said that to me and i said well just look at what you're doing i said you know by the bible who the is you know what denominational system is you know 666. you know the the cults and everything you know that mormonism's not it's fake christianity jehovah's witness avoids jesus christ but i but i but i don't see you spending one moment online warning the world about those and yet you know that's the real deadliness to the world and you know the whole world's gonna follow after it and you haven't spent one minute online with your videos telling the world about that though you have this stored up treasure and instead you're spending your months and weeks bashing a man who you know is a decent honest man even if you disagree with his doctor you know he's decent and honest you you you know it produces the kind of lives you see and the people you went to church with how and that makes sense to you i said you see friend it shows it shows you're under the control of a demon because that don't even make sense that's not even sensible it's not even logical from a common human standpoint who would do that somebody blinded somebody who's fell under the influence of an evil spirit and and i'm glad this thing ain't over i'm glad it ain't over i hey i get there's a militant response but like i was and and maybe i've even done it myself but you know this morning in the sunday school class we were all agreeing that we ought to have paul's uh response paul said when he's telling the church about people i mean you can't get worse than this they've become the enemies of the cross they've become the enemies of christ and paul said i tell you even weeping it just goes to show the heart of paul sometimes we want to let our righteous indignation rise up and oh they're finished they're done and that's it they're done they should just go to hell and burn forever and you know that's not paul's attitude jesus wept over jerusalem brother branham in the sixth seal when he when he tells about how that he said i saw something in there today and he said it took my breath away he said i had to get up and walk out in the yard and walk around to get back to myself and he he comes to the end of the service and he says he starts describing what he saw not in intricate detail but generally and he says the lord showed him people that he knew ministers men churches families and he knew them and he said already because of their rejection of the word they already were covered in blackness already across the line already couldn't even be saved and brother branham said i can't even say that i can't no i can't lord i can't refuse that i can't say that i can't say that from the pulpit i can't name those people here's a prophet standing in a pulp at one time said it was a saddest thing just the other day in a meeting and he said young people teenagers piled up around the altar trying to repent and i could already see it was too late they had already at some point crossed the line see it's not for me to decide it's not for you to decide i'm talking about what what kind of attitude is in our heart we ought to be brokenhearted we ought not to be indignant we ought to pray and have mercy and we ought to try to live it as best we can and somehow this thing ain't over this thing ain't over god can still move that's the kind of attitude i want to have that's the kind of attitude i want you to have that's the kind of attitude we need to have an outreach that's the kind of attitude we have need to have when we go among the cherokees that's the kind of attitude we need to have on the streets of beaufort god can if god found me he can find anybody if god saved me he and hang on to me he can save and hang on to anybody your heart should be brother sister come to your senses see but if you cut yourself off with the wrong attitude toward them and they detect that as if they wouldn't they will and if you cut yourself off from even being able to help them well then what good are you see so i'm glad that as the bible says let a man examine himself see brother branham says in the sixth seal oh my he says and then in kentucky they're trying to live in a bygone days of the east here still back in in renfrew valley they still have that to this day so back in the renfrow valley and things you go back to the old days there's something causing that that people would say oh i i long for the old days most time it's you're fantasizing over a day that never really existed when you were there but but a lot of times there's the there's this longing to go back to something and brother branham says there's something causing that but when it comes but when it comes back to go back to a gospel in the original you don't want to do that you want something modern you see goes to show see there's a what makes a man do wrong what makes him drink and carry on or woman do wrong it's because he or she is trying there is something in her thirsting there is something in him thirsting and they're trying to quench that holy thirst with the things of the world when god ought to be that quench he made you that way to thirst that's the reason you thirst for something god made you that way so you would turn that holy thirst to him but when you try to quench that thirst how dare anybody to do that you have no right to do that you try to quench the holy thirst that you're thirsting for something and then you turn it into the world trying to satisfy it with the world you can't do it there's only one thing will fill that up and that's god he made you that way to try to chase happiness in the world you're fighting against your own makeup no wonder people are miserable and depressed and living on tranquilizers because they literally their greatest enemy is that guy or gal that's standing in the mirror looking at them amen and so he says i'll tell you one morning when jesus and his bride i love this one morning when he comes back to the earth there'll be a paradise of god there that oh my them old warriors of the battle walked down through there with their friends and loved ones the anthems will fill the air of the angelic coast our future's bright friends oh it was well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the lord that's been prepared for you like you should have had back there before eve started the ball rolling in sin amen he says yes see so the sixth seal is going to do something yes sir truly the whole world is groaning and and in pain for the millennium age i i love that fact that he says it here there's a world you're longing for a world and you're going to get a world like you should have had in the beginning you're going to have a body like you should have had in the beginning i i thought about that and i thought about all my ups and downs and weaknesses and trials of life and i said lord i wasn't even supposed to be built like this i wasn't supposed to have these kind of failures i wasn't supposed to live in a crazy world the bible the bible talks about brother adam says we live in a neurotic age that we seem unfitted for it's it's just a constant now if you're a sinner you love it you go man you can't get enough of it you you the reason you can't get enough of it because there's no way to quench that thirst you just keep going until it takes all your money and all your health and all your life and all your home and your and that's why marriage collapse and young people commit suicide because they're chasing uh something like chasing the wind but when you come back around and you realize i just thought about myself and i just thought you know something friends i'm gonna tell you when i get on the other side brother branham talked about people going to be there that's going to shock you i'm going to tell you the most shocked person in the world that i'm going to see is the very first mirror i step in front of on the other side when i step in front of that very first mirror on the other side i'm going to be so surprised i'm going to look at that dude and say you made it really you made it yep here i am how'd you get here grace grace god's grace grace that is greater than all our sin grace grace god's grace grace that is greater than all my sin a world brother branham starts telling he he finishes you should just i don't want to ruin it for you you should go listen to that sixth seal i told sister debbie you know and i said you want to hear a good tape i said hear the sex seal brother madame explain so much that's going on in there how the word is going to go forth how the sealed and those who are going to be sealed and those who aren't and you know and and and a message so great that that the unwise virgin of every age didn't have to go through the tribulation but this one will because she rejected the greatest message ever to strike the earth see and and even you remember those two tribes dan and ephraim that got blotted out from under heaven do you know when you go to ezekiel and when you read it and when you when you read uh revelation 7 they're not there and but if you go to read ezekiel 48 which is the millennium chapter brother branham used ezekiel 48 for the millennium chapter there they are they're listed right there again grace grace brother branham said see they might have been blotted out from under heaven but they're not blotted out in heaven and say well what what what did that cost them being blotted out from under heaven well they had no opportunity to be elected they're not listed in those 144 000 they literally blotted out from under heaven meant they didn't even have the opportunity to be the 144 000 there was even no chance for them to be that because why they were an old testament type of the unwise virgin who suffered for rejecting the message of their hour and all of their prophets beginning at moses and and but yet but yet now look at this here's here's an amazing thing the the old testament dan and ephraim a type of the unwise virgin get to be in the millennium the gentile unwise virgin do not only the 144 000 are there with us as attendance to the bride the unwise virgins sleep for a thousand years and come up at the at the back side of it see say well good grief that don't sound fair why did why did they get to be in the millennium but these don't because these rejected under the age of the holy ghost this was just blood of bulls and goats you see and so they weren't blotted out in heaven in the millennium they're back there again in their tribal order but but the unwise virgin rejected i mean think now think about how important this message is it's literally the deciding factor it literally takes two righteous people one of them going to rapture one don't one's in a millennium the other is not and what's the deciding factor belief in the word acceptance and because that because it takes the new birth and new birth only comes by faith in the revealed word there's no other way to get it and only the holy ghost can give it to you i can't give it to you no one else can give it to you you have to have a personal revelation given to you personally by jesus christ and then you then now it's on you to gird up the loins of your mind and and avail yourselves of the grace that is promised to be given at the revelation of jesus christ brother branham starts telling very tenderly he uh he says you know he says this just personal now he says you know he says i i dreamed the other night he said my wife came to me me done said she said bill i'll ask you a question about heaven he said all right honey sit down she said well she said you know you loved hope and he goes and i still do and she said you know you love me yes and she said now i don't think i would have a problem but hope was a really jealous woman so in heaven who who gets to be your wife and he said both of you and she said i don't understand he said see honey it's not like it is now there there's no difference in the sex glands i said we're just he said now the form of a man in a form of a woman remain but the sex lands are only added for reproduction he says it'll be a love so much more than that you won't even it won't even enter your mind the fallen way of love down here that won't even be a thought in your mind and he says look let me let me let me give it to you like this he says now says you know i love you yes bill and i and you love me yes well said if it had to be a showdown between me and the lord jesus who would you choose and she said i would choose the lord she said no bill i do love you no matter how much i love you if i could if i had to give one up i'd give you up and keep him and he said thank you sweetheart he said that makes me glad to hear you say that see because then he knows he'll have her as an eternal treasure anyway and so he says i'm glad he says now let's imagine he said let's imagine i get all cleaned up and he said i go down the streets all dressed up and he said some prostitute woman comes running up to me throwing her arms around me saying oh i sure do love you and he said how would that make you feel and she said i don't think i would like that too good and he says all right he says but now what if it was the lord jesus walking down the street and that same prostitute ran and threw her arms around and said jesus i love you she said oh i would enjoy that he said you see there he said it's just a love so much higher that you can't even imagine and he says he says i was i was he said i had a dream the other night i'm going to close friends you're good can i take another minute he says i had a dream you should go hear it yourself and you want to have a church service and you go hear it and he says he says i had a dream and he says i was at the rewards ceremony he said no not the judgment bar we're talking talking about when the when the crowns are being given out there remember three and a half years in heaven ain't just sitting at a table with the marriage supper there's a reward ceremony and all that's going to go on and and brother branham says i was there at the when the crowns were being handed out and he said and he said i was just kind of standing back and he said and they would they would call a name and he said it was a big golden i said ivory staircase that made a big panorama panorama and come down he said that way everybody in in there could see everything there was no bad seat in the house and he said they would call a name and he said i would look down through the crowd and he said and here they would come and he said oh i know them he said it'd be a brother and a sister in life and husband and wife and he said and here they come together walking up there they'd hit that staircase and walk up around there and said you it is well done with you my faithful servants enter into the joys of the lord and he said there's that man and woman they'd jump off in there like he said that glory land just said i could as far as i could see just a beautiful paradise and and he said and and he said then they'd call like like arm and neville and sister neville and they said here they'd go and oh oh and brother brandon said i'm just standing off to the side he's not just shouting and jumping i'm down and rejoicing so they walked up there and said oh brother neville when he got up there and said well done my faithful servant enter into the joys of the lord and he said oh brother neville jumped off back in there and said the last i saw he just going up one hill and down another jumping scout and he said i was out there jumping screaming shouting amen amen brother caleb you're going to be jumping and screaming and shouting and so and so he he said and then he said william branham and he said oh no i never thought i would have to go up there and william branham and he said so i started through the crowd and everybody said god bless you brother brandon praise the lord he said it's like leaving a meeting they're wanting to shake your hand and pat you god bless you brother brad and praise the lord yeah thank you thank you thank you thank you and he said i hit that i hit that edge of the steps and he said now i want to make sure i get a good look at him i want to make sure okay he said i stopped and he said all of a sudden he said i felt something slip into one of my arms and he said i looked down and he said it was hope my first wife said she's looking up at me those big dark eyes dark hair beaut and the beauty of perfection and he said i said hope and and because mida had asked him about hope you know being a jealous woman and he said you've seen her there billy he said i've seen her twice he said i've seen her twice he said i saw sharon my daughter she was there oh friends this thing's real and he said he said she slipped into my arm and he said just i started to go he said i felt something hit the other arm and i looked and it was mita with those dark eyes and that dark hair and he said he said and here we went walking on up up those ivory stairs oh friends i i started i wanted to jump off my lawnmower and run around and scream and holler a little people think i'm crazy oh what an hour what a time that we're headed for i thought to myself i'm going to get a church tomorrow and i'm going to say sister mom thank you for giving me this message i want to say to my family thank you for believing it thank you thank you church that you're believers we've got a life together we're never gonna be a part we're always gonna have one another we got a land we're going to the sixth seal brings that to pass you're living right at the at the crux of of that happening the when the bride goes up the fifth seal the jews under the altar see remember the dead in christ rise first remember then we which are alive and remain are changed when they leave that realm that brother branham saw them in that's under the throne also that's not in the presence of god remember he said i want to see jesus he said no he's up higher but someday right down that way right down that way he'll come right down through there and he says and then we'll all come back to the earth i mean you're hearing a body friends that's fallen and broken i remember brother dale preaching here some years ago and how that we long for that theophany body that word body but do you know brother he showed in the scripture and showed in the in the quotes that when brother branham was over there those people were longing to be back here here you are when this broken body longing to be by in that body and they're in that body longing to be back in this body only glorified not broken down in sin but oh the millennium we're going to be restored we're going to have new bodies hallelujah and when they when they see those sixth dimension saints that brother branham saw including brother branham now including brother eddie including sister seal including all of our loved ones that have passed away when they empty out then the jews under the fifth seal see them leaving like hey hey what about us what about us no no you gotta wait you're not leaving yet your brethren still have to still have to die the sixth tribulation is about to start in so the fifth seal goes right into the sixth seal and blends out the bride goes up and satan is cast down oh what a time like brother jewel sings won't it be a time oh won't it be a time amen praise the lord blood tony can you sing that
