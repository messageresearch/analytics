TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so [Music] you can stand and we'll pray amen i'm going to be doing something a little different today brother jason and i talked about doing a regular missions update but kind of weaving it into some teaching about missions as well so i'm going to start that and we'll probably lord willing do it the first month of every quarter so let's pray father we come before you now and we're so thankful for your goodness lord for the blessing that you've placed upon us father we're so thankful for that regardless of the circumstances that we face in life the difficulties we know that your goodness goes with us your blessing goes with us lord because whatever we whatever we go through we're not subject to fate or to what the devil has programmed for us but we're we're only subject to what you have planned for us and what you have purpose for us lord and we ask for your for your wisdom to have your mind in everything lord i pray that your holy spirit would come lord and that you would be magnified and glorified in this missions report and teaching father we commit ourselves to you for your glory we ask in jesus name amen amen you can go ahead and be seated all right so it's been a while since i've done a missions report and i think my i never gave a report about my trip uh in september and i can barely remember it now covet erased some of my memory near-term memories for some reason but um i'm gonna do my best to give a slightly less detailed report than i would have if i'd given it in september so um when i was there before i spent a day with brother megaly emphasizing the importance of translation translating brother branham's sermons we've been working for several years now on the supernatural series and we're at book four and trying to light a fire under him oh it's all translated it just needs to be edited and then printed so we just uh book four has been sent to the printer and should be delivered to brother megaly i believe this week for distribution and he's been he's been faithfully doing that uh distributing all the first three books to people that he knows in the assemblies of god church and friends that he's encountered over time but we really wanted to get them going on translating brother branham's messages so we've we started i think since september uh he brother megaly has done it with his son george's help who's expert in english so they did the token christ is the mystery of god revealed and this day is this scripture fulfilled i think we're we're basically planning to you know translate probably 10 sermons and then try to get that in into one book for distribution so then kind of do it like that so we're continually getting you know a good amount of things printed at the same time try to get them in kind of hard cover to be more durable and last for a longer period of time amen so um it was early september that i went to egypt and it was a trip that was delayed by a day because i got the wrong covet test so um instead of being there for the first day of the meetings which there was a service at i think seven o'clock i got there a little bit after two a.m on that on that day so i left a day late but i was there for the days that we were have i was gonna have brother megaly take that first service anyways so i guess i just wasn't there to be to witness it uh be there with them but i got got in at 2 a.m and then we had two services on wednesday and two services on thursday and then we went back and then i went back to cairo to a hotel near the airport where that's where i met with brother megaly to talk about translations a lot so this is brother george so brother megaly is the pastor i'm working with there this is his son george his son george is in a school that everything is in english so first few times he translated for me a few years back i think he's probably 16 years old and it was a little rough so every time i go i'm a little bit nervous about having him translate i was just blown away this time there's a brother who's his what he does for a living is translation he's a pentecostal uh evangelist and he actually we let brother the the pentecostal evangelist translated for me then we just kind of rotated it then brother george translated for me eventually that pentecostal evangelist just sat down and said i'm not translating for you anymore george is extreme extremely gifted at translating just let from now on just have him translate everything for you so i was blessed by that i think he probably has a future once he's done with school in translating the message so pray for brother george i think you know even in egypt the devil tries to work in the minds of young people so there's a lot of ups and downs for brother george but all in all the lord's really working in his life just can keep him in prayer and i think we had about a hundred people that came to the meetings this time and the lord really moved we um the people are super hungry they love teaching and so they're really rejoicing i think i if i remember correctly i spent uh three of the services speaking about predestination and there was one assemblies of god he had he was very proud of having his masters of divinity and he was a minister there in assemblies of god church and literally stood up in the middle of the service and started asking me questions and so at first i just listened to him and i said it's just a common question it's going to be answered by the sermon have us have your seat well he that made him angry so he started yelling at me and i just proceeded to preach over the top of him so then you know because i told him i was going to be answered he didn't think it was answered so the end of the service the holy spirit was just moving sweetly upon the people i was getting ready to turn it over to brother megaly to lead in worship and this guy gets up and starts yelling i'm literally making a invitation and you know having the people bow their heads the man stands up and starts yelling at me and so i just ignored him i continued to do what i do and then i bowed my head because i was in the middle of going to prayer so i bowed my head and began to pray he's still talking eventually he gets gets i get probably a minute into the prayer and eventually realizes i'm an idiot i'm yelling at this man and he's praying what am i doing so then he stops but then i just closed the service because it destroyed the spirit that was there and the man just needed to get out well anyways in egypt you can face a lot of troubles from people like that with immigration and many ministers have foreign ministers going into egypt have faced problems because something was preached that they didn't agree with or they didn't like and they go to immigration and you'll never wind up being back there so i was the lord's in control i can't i can't say that i was all that concerned um the lord the lord's in control if he doesn't want me to go to egypt again i'm really okay with that i serve at his pleasure if he wants me to go to wherever he wants me to go that's where i want to go otherwise i'll stay home i prefer that but that being said i was concerned that this was gonna call it short though i had peace in my heart about it brother megaly was very upset he came up to my room at the conference hall and talked for two or three hours about how upset he was and what we should do about it and i just said don't worry about it the lord's gonna take care of it god has a purpose in all of it it's frustrating that the man did that but he's like well can we have a question and answer session the next day i said why not let's do that after the service is over and we dismiss but let everybody know if you want to stay for questions and answers you're welcome to so i i continued to preach on predestination at the end of the service he he asked his question and surprisingly he was completely satisfied with the answer and then then i then i just made the statement just to teach and say you know i want to i want to ask a question of everyone is standing up and shaking your hand with an angry face is that how we show the love of christ to people just curious and the man immediately said forgive me forgive me i apologize i acted wrong i should not have done that so i was so thankful the lord worked that out but not only he not only worked that worked it out the man at the end said this was the best conference i've ever been to i can't wait to come back we want to come to your services this is what he told brother megaly so that's the man in the yellow there um so so thankful that the lord took that and turned that completely around a minister brother malek is on the right brother malik has i guess he's on your left excuse me he's uh has albinism but he's a he's a wonderful wonderful brother he had not come to any of the meetings for since the first meeting uh things things went awry between him and another minister and brother megaly and brother megali has always invited him to everything and this time he decided to come and he was just rejoicing and come to find out he's he he might have departed because he felt felt um he was deceived by another minister regarding brother megaly and coming back realizing that he's still following the message and and rejoicing in the word so thankful for that the other one next to me is the translator the pentecostal evangelist i was talking about brother ahmad good brother still in process of deciding whether he believes the message or not has great respect for brother branham as most pentecostals do but not totally sure about the teachings of the message so we pray for brother ahmad there eating eating our lunch at one of the during the conference and so this man the one closer to the screen his brother ahmad the one behind him i i didn't catch his name but for the last three or four services that we've had there meetings that we've had there when we've had the prayer line his wife has come forward asking for prayer for her husband she was he was always trying to stop her from going to the services and from what i could understand was not not treating her right and she was very burdened for him and for for the children and so every time she would come and pray this was the first time he actually came reluctantly came i think he came because there was a swimming pool and free food but he was in all the meetings and after the last service he came up to have me pray for him and he gave his heart to the lord so so so thankful for that sister she was so burdened and we've been praying for so long for her husband and god answers theirs so it's brother megaly on your left brother george on the right and then i think that's brother megaly's nephew who helps out with the audio visual there next to brother megaly this is a family that has been coming to church there for quite a while she she and her husband are always witnessing they um the book i wrote called foundations we had that translated and printed there and they people use it as an outreach tool they said they've been giving it out to everybody they possibly could on the streets witnessing to them about the message all right this is the mostly the whole group there that was it was at the last meetings not all of them attend brother megaly's church some of them were visitors people that he invited for outreach sitting out with brother megaly and late at night and eating sunflower seeds and having fellowship with all the people it's kind of the surrounding area around the conference this is in the it's inside of the nile delta that's why you see a little bit of grass there and palm trees a nice boat there for some reason have no idea why there's a boat in the now i guess it's in the nile delta so they must take it to the nile and there's crossing the nile to get back into cairo amen so brother branham speaking about the gospel and how the how the the god's purpose and god's plan for missions is not just in word only amen he said preach the gospel and the gospel is manifesting demonstrating the power of the holy spirit paul said the gospel come to us not through word only but through the manifestation and demonstrations of the holy spirit paul said i'd never come to you with great words of wisdom by some doctor of so forth but i come to you in power and demonstration of the holy spirit that your faith would not be in the wisdom or knowledge of the men of this world but in the power of the resurrection of jesus christ because he lives the same yesterday today and forever god help us to believe the same thing and god vindicate the same thing as he has been doing amen mark 16 15-18 again these are very familiar verses but it's foundational for missions and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature amen he didn't just leave it at that as just words being spoken but it's something supernatural he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe the signs follow the word when the word is preached the supernatural follows in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover paul in first thessalonians 1 5 for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake so it not only it comes in power and the holy ghost and assurance god is in other words god is proving to their hearts that this is the absolute truth but then it's not only that he points to their lives the kind of men that they were so part of god proving his word amongst the people is the character of the people that are proclaiming it no paul never claimed to be perfect but he did claim to have a clear conscience right and he did claim and show show forth godly character and that's what needs to be in every uh every missionary you're representing what you're speaking about you're not just speaking about a product that you haven't tried yourself you're speaking about something that has changed your life and that that life needs to matter be manifested in front of the people first corinthians two two through five if i determine not to know anything among you saved jesus christ in him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling oh that doesn't sound like a very good message minister i was there in power and i was there in strength and i i had great charisma that's not what paul says i was with you in weakness perhaps he was a little sick you know had that eye problem and in fear and in much trembling my paul where's your faith where's your faith it's an action it's an action through many hardships trials difficulties paul kept going and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power the reality is if you look at the true gospel of jesus christ it's obviously contrary to human reasoning you're going to say that your god came and was crucified it's part of the reasons why the why the muslims preach and say that that christ was not crucified because they think it's such a shameful thing and it is a shameful thing so that's not the words of man's wisdom only reason why someone would believe such a crazy plot is the spirit of god comes and vindicates it and changes the person's heart it isn't enough that the spirit of god would just vindicate it because man would explain it away as magic or something that's not enough it takes the spirit working in the hearts of the people if you remember in the book of acts it said it said over and over again that the lord opened the people's hearts to hear what was being preached it takes god opening hearts amen but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god amen matthew 28 19 i just look at that first part go ye therefore go means to traverse or to travel so get out of jerusalem go go into the samaria and and go into the coasts of the gentiles and teach all nations teach them to observe a part of the word no teach them to observe all things the full counsel isn't that what paul said i've not shunned to declare unto you the full counsel of god amen so that's our duty that's our duty as every christian is duty bound to to be a part of sending the gospel out to the nations so let's look at i'm gonna i'm coming close on time i'm just going to skip some of these and do this the next time brother branham and the sermon convinced and concerned he says i think we should be concerned i think we ought to support brother jose and any other missionary with all we've got the first thing we have to do is be convinced that jesus is coming this is his program we ought to be concerned about our brother whether he's black yellow brown or white we ought to be concerned about those people over there and if we cannot go we ought to dig down and do everything we can to support that god is those that god is called to go let us bow our heads and he begins to sing the songs millions now in sin shame are dying listen to their sad and bitter cry haste and brother hasten to their rescue quickly answer master here am i if you can't go send someone but it goes beyond just that it also goes into what paul talks about second corinthians 1 8-11 for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raises the dead who delivered us from so great at death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us the next part here is what i'm emphasizing you also helping to gather by prayer for us that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf the believer should support missions but more than that it should be on his heart to pray for missions ephesians 6 18-19 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching therein too with all perseverance and supplication for all saints and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel amen those are the things that we need to be praying for missions in i just want to finish with a mission need that we have right now brother megaly currently is renting a church building i'm i'm going to say there's probably a dozen churches that rent this facility and it's spread out throughout the week so because of that they can't meet on sunday they meet on a thursday the church would really like to purchase a building it's a big project it's expensive it might take a long time to to to raise the funds but i'd really like to be able to help them purchase a building so they had could have their own place to worship this is a little new for me because i'm i'm used to working in turkey where it's just people are coming and going coming and going and you would never really want to buy a building per se because you'd be stuck people refugees might be moved from that city to another city so you just always stuck with renting but these people here are in egypt permanently and they live in the cairo area and i'd really like to be able to help them purchase a building as you see on there it's it's about 700 000 egyptian pounds to buy a building which translates into about 44 000 in today's current exchange rate like i said it may take a long time to do it but i'd like to work towards saving that and being able to help them get their own church building and have a place to worship where they can meet on a regular basis wednesday nights sundays as they'd like to do so amen let's stand gracious father we come before you now lord and we just want to lift up and pray for those missionaries which are traveling in the world today lord i'm thinking of specifically brother luis orego and his family down in south america lord they've been gone a long time and i think they have a bit of time to go yet still lord i pray that you'd keep your hand of grace and protection upon them lord i pray you bless brother luis's ministry lord use him to bring many souls to the kingdom and to heal broken hearts and to deliver those who are in darkness father lord just go before each one of us lord move upon our hearts lead us guide us and direct us lord and what you'd have us to do in the direction you'd have us to go we want your glory and all things father we commit the service the worship to you lord i ask that you'd anoint each one of us today lord to accomplish the purpose you have through each one of us we ask these things in the name of our lord jesus christ amen god bless you [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music]
