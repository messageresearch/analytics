[33:55] with the purpose I have today
[33:57] but amen certainly trusting the Lord I
[34:00] appreciate all your prayer
[34:03] prayers of those here and those who are
[34:06] streaming I've had a lot of comments
[34:09] from around the world and I was up in
[34:12] Tennessee and had a quite a bit of
[34:14] people inquiring up there and different
[34:16] things and talking about hey man I said
[34:19] tomorrow's the big day
[34:23] well I um it's it's a wonderful
[34:26] opportunity for me I've I wish I could
[34:29] say I've enjoyed my six weeks off but
[34:32] I probably haven't enjoyed it amen
[34:34] wanting every day to be back in the
[34:37] saddle trying to use the better part of
[34:40] wisdom and follow the doctor's advice
[34:42] and so today I covet your prayers and
[34:46] I'm I've got a number of things to keep
[34:49] me from going crazy amen I brought my
[34:52] pencil so that it'll kind of keep me in
[34:54] a frame of mind to keep stay in the
[34:57] material and amen keep me from becoming
[35:00] a crazy man I don't normally wear my
[35:03] Apple watch when I preach because I get
[35:06] too excited and she thinks I'm being
[35:08] killed and tries to call
[35:10] 9-1-1 that's happened so many times and
[35:14] I've caught it sometimes with within
[35:16] seconds before it dialed the number
[35:19] and so uh so today I've I've got it set
[35:22] to um keep up with my heart rate that's
[35:27] that's actually been the problem
[35:29] whenever I would exert and that's why
[35:32] the doctor The Specialist told me you've
[35:34] got to stop preaching she knew I was
[35:35] rather charismatic and she said whenever
[35:38] you which she was right I knew because
[35:40] whenever I'd exercise that's when I
[35:42] would feel the the back pressure
[35:44] building up in my eye
[35:47] and so uh she said You Know You're
[35:49] vulnerable for a little while to for it
[35:53] to resurface again I said you mean a
[35:55] third time she said oh yeah this thing
[35:57] can just keep keep coming and I said
[35:59] well
[36:00] it can come I thought to myself it can
[36:03] come and come and come but the devil
[36:05] still ain't nobody
[36:06] and we don't we don't regard him not not
[36:10] worried about him because I know that
[36:12] the Lord is in control of my life and my
[36:15] Ministry this is his ministry anyway
[36:17] it's his gift not mine I'm not the gift
[36:19] at all uh I'm just a vessel he placed a
[36:23] piece of Machinery in and
[36:25] um he turns it on and turns it off he
[36:27] uses it preaches through it amen so when
[36:30] you're rejoicing over the word I am too
[36:32] I'm right there with you amen it's
[36:34] wonderful to me as well
[36:37] but I um I'm under advice to just not
[36:40] and that's always my problem is balance
[36:42] I'm always going harder at it than I
[36:45] need to
[36:46] but as you know man it just is like a
[36:49] seven course meal and you sit down and I
[36:53] love to eat everybody knows that and uh
[36:55] the word gets so delicious and I just
[36:58] become into a jubilee and so I'm not not
[37:01] making any claims that I won't hit
[37:03] Jubilee today but I'm going to try to
[37:05] measure it out and um what might happen
[37:08] today
[37:09] is since I can't go extreme I might have
[37:14] to go longer
[37:19] oh for good
[37:21] praise the Lord
[37:23] so you just bear with me and um
[37:27] so as we we want to look into the word
[37:29] of God I've got so much I want to say so
[37:32] many sermons piles and piles of them
[37:34] over these six weeks the Lord has not
[37:36] stopped the fountain that's for sure my
[37:39] problem is I want to preach them all at
[37:41] once so
[37:42] I can't keep y'all here till eight
[37:44] o'clock tonight so we're going to just
[37:46] have to get what's on our heart today
[37:48] I'm quite sure I won't finish it I'm not
[37:51] going to try but I'm going to kind of
[37:53] you might see me doing that I'm just
[37:55] kind of monitoring and just just trying
[37:57] to be use a little wisdom that'd be all
[37:58] right
[37:59] amen so God bless you we want to turn to
[38:02] Ephesians chapter 2 this morning

[38:08] Brother Caleb to send a prayer cloth
[38:11] with brother Bradley and sister back

[38:25] meetings coming up at the end of this
[38:27] month and I was with brother Daryl in

[38:36] Jubilee preaching at the end of the
[38:37] month so just be patient amen praise the
[38:40] Lord I promise you we're going to have a

[39:28] comparison to say look we all were born
[39:31] in sin we all at one time police says
[39:34] another place at one time we all had our
[39:37] conversation in the lust of the flesh
[39:41] and the things of the world
[39:44] and we were by very nature we
[39:48] Paul
[39:49] were by very nature the children of
[39:52] Wrath even as others
[39:55] God who was rich in Mercy
[39:58] loved us while we were even still a
[40:01] sinner imagine how much he loves you now
[40:03] that you've surrendered your life to him
[40:04] see not that he loves you more you can't
[40:07] make him love you more or less but look
[40:09] at what opportunities
[40:11] you are providing for him now I want you
[40:15] to absorb that you let alone you are
[40:19] providing opportunities for great big
[40:22] God
[40:24] brother Brown said he has no hands but
[40:25] yours no feet but yours no mouth but
[40:27] yours amen we are his continuation his
[40:32] ministry continuing in the earth does
[40:34] that thrill you as much as it does me
[40:36] so Paul is not trying to insult us he's
[40:39] trying to make a contrasting comparison
[40:42] here so so that he can show you in
[40:45] contradistinction what you used to be
[40:47] but you're not that anymore say well I'm
[40:51] still a long ways off from where I want
[40:52] to be but you're not what you used to be
[40:55] huh calm down
[40:58] calm down
[41:01] but God verse 4.
[41:04] oh wait verse 3. among whom also we all
[41:08] had our conversation
[41:10] end times past in the lust of our flesh
[41:15] fulfilling the desires of the flesh we
[41:18] did come on we did we did might as well
[41:21] own it and of the Mind yep guilty been
[41:25] there done that got the T-shirt
[41:27] and we're by Nature the children of
[41:31] Wrath even as others now Paul's going to
[41:34] go on to prove to you we're not going to
[41:35] get into it today but he's going to
[41:37] prove to you that that nature he's
[41:40] referring to wasn't your original nature
[41:43] it was something put on You by a sin
[41:45] birth your original nature come from God
[41:47] that's why you believe his word you
[41:50] believe his word now do you know why you
[41:52] say Amanda's word now because in the in
[41:54] the eons of time back before there was
[41:57] time
[41:58] and morning Stars sang together and sons
[42:00] of God shouted for Joy there was a great
[42:04] battle that took place and some of the
[42:06] some of the Angelic beings refused to
[42:09] say Amen any longer but some of the
[42:12] God's angels and all of God's elected
[42:15] family continued to say Amen to the word
[42:18] you say Amen today because you're
[42:21] reliving your life back there brother
[42:23] remember says just to Veil over your
[42:25] memory you don't remember that see
[42:27] oh my
[42:29] what is what will it be when we get over
[42:31] Yonder
[42:33] but God who is rich in Mercy not just
[42:37] was but is
[42:38] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[42:41] even when we were dead in sins hath
[42:45] quickened us together with Christ by
[42:49] Grace ye are saved amen let's pray
[42:55] Master we thank you today and I'm
[42:58] grateful to be standing here Lord I'm
[43:00] I'm I'm I feel myself hurrying to just

[43:06] forward to this time and I just want you
[43:09] to take over now father and bring forth
[43:13] your word Lord we're we're showing up
[43:16] for duty today Lord I have one Express
[43:19] purpose there are numerous things that
[43:22] I'm numerous purposes that I have in my
[43:24] heart but one of the foremost purpose
[43:27] that I have standing here today is to
[43:30] cast out devils and Lord I know that the
[43:33] preaching of the Gospel drives back
[43:35] spirits of unbelief it Cast Away Devils
[43:39] out of the people's minds so that the
[43:41] Holy Spirit can deal with their hearts
[43:43] and get the necessary minerals and
[43:46] vitamins and nutrients and elements of
[43:48] the word of God that we need for this
[43:51] hour so Lord I put Satan on notice he
[43:54] might as well run for it now now because
[43:56] the word is going to pound him oh God I
[44:00] pray today that you'll let the people
[44:01] forget about yesterday don't worry about
[44:04] tomorrow we're here right now and we're
[44:07] ready to hear the word of God I commit
[44:10] it to you in Jesus name amen God bless
[44:13] you as you're seated
[44:31] you know the word of God
[44:35] cast out Devils did you know that
[44:37] you know I was I was
[44:40] um
[44:41] speaking here a couple of days ago
[44:43] to a a young sister a very fine young
[44:46] woman believer very loyal to God and and
[44:50] uh
[44:52] you know she had she had written to me
[44:56] and asking for some time perhaps with
[44:59] sister Debbie and I if we could have
[45:01] some time to sit down together some
[45:02] questions on her mind and things the
[45:04] enemy troubling her with
[45:06] and so I I wrote back to say that be
[45:09] just fine sis right now we're in North
[45:11] Carolina and we're trying to get back
[45:13] and then we know more than got back and
[45:16] we had to leave again and and time went
[45:19] on and so I managed to follow up with
[45:21] her and I said hey so this week it'd be
[45:23] great sister Dave and I have some time
[45:25] and she wrote back to say brother Jason
[45:27] it's all good she said the Lord answered
[45:30] all my questions in a sermon brother
[45:32] Matt preached on Sunday and she said uh
[45:35] Mom it's all good and I thought to
[45:37] myself you know here here here here's
[45:40] what happened and I want you to I want
[45:42] you to grasp this because this isn't a
[45:44] fairy tale this is actually what
[45:46] happened in another realm you know
[45:48] there's another realm Beyond this one
[45:50] you know that you you you have very
[45:53] limited sight you have very limited
[45:55] comprehension you don't even see all the
[45:57] wavelengths of light
[45:59] actually in science we'll tell you there
[46:01] are many wavelengths of light you don't
[46:03] see an infrared you don't see
[46:04] ultraviolet you don't see you actually
[46:06] they say your visible site is a very
[46:08] little tiny in a long chart a visible
[46:12] way of of wavelength and only a little
[46:15] bit of it is visible to you that this is
[46:18] why you should just let God run your
[46:20] life
[46:21] this is why you don't see over that
[46:24] mountain you're you know it's in your
[46:26] way but the Lord and you know you're
[46:28] here needing and praying and asking to
[46:30] do this and he's he's listening
[46:34] but he's looking over the mountain going
[46:36] uh nope can't do that because you don't
[46:39] know what you're going to face over here
[46:40] but I do so I'm gonna I'm gonna have to
[46:42] keep you right here in this training I
[46:44] know you don't like it but you're gonna
[46:45] have to keep training a little while
[46:46] because when you get over here you're
[46:48] going to need that and you go when you
[46:49] get over here you're going to remember
[46:50] back and you're going to thank me Lord
[46:51] thank you amen for guiding my life
[46:54] and I and I thought to myself how that
[46:57] the word of God cast out devils and it
[47:01] drives back spirits of unbelief you know
[47:03] the sister didn't get smarter that's not
[47:07] how she got through it it's not that
[47:09] suddenly she had more common sense or
[47:11] suddenly she got more brilliant she's
[47:13] already brilliant it's not that she got
[47:15] more brilliant and figured it out you
[47:17] know what happened the what was her
[47:20] problem was not intelligence her problem
[47:22] was not comprehension but there's an
[47:25] evil spirit troubling her mind and the
[47:27] word of God preaching cast him away
[47:31] and then the Holy Spirit revealed his
[47:33] word and it fixed the problem
[47:35] I'd say to you today open up your heart
[47:38] and your mind to the word of God I
[47:40] promise you it has an answer for every
[47:43] problem you could ever have every
[47:45] question and brother Branham said you
[47:48] know speaking of the Hidden manner the
[47:49] future aspect of the Hidden manner that
[47:52] it will be the Eternal unfolding
[47:55] of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[47:58] ceaseless ages brother M says all the
[48:02] questions you ever had
[48:05] everything you wondered at will be known
[48:08] over there and you know I'm gonna one of
[48:12] the greatest things I don't know about
[48:13] you
[48:17] you say I I want to know more about
[48:20] Christ I do I do too
[48:23] but you know one of the most perplexing
[48:25] questions I have the one of the things
[48:27] that I'm going to want to know more
[48:29] about when I get over there is I'm going
[48:31] to want to understand more about me why
[48:34] was I so weak at times why did I fail so
[48:37] often why didn't I let the devil do this
[48:39] why did that you know and and brother
[48:41] Brandon said when you cross over the
[48:43] first thing that'll go through your mind
[48:44] I'm glad a prophet knows the first thing
[48:46] that'll go through my mind so the first
[48:48] thing that'll go through your mind when
[48:50] you cross over is
[48:52] you ready
[48:54] why was I ever worried
[49:00] I'll be over there and you'll sit down
[49:02] under a tree start thinking about life
[49:04] and all the things you worried about on
[49:05] this side and he said you'll sit down
[49:08] under a tree and just laugh
[49:10] my goodness how did I how what was I
[49:13] worried about I always was the son of
[49:14] God I was always going to get I was
[49:16] always going to get here hallelujah
[49:20] so but you know here we we find that
[49:24] we come through life at the according to
[49:28] the plan of God in Redemption and God
[49:30] was never interested in building a robot
[49:33] economy or robot Kingdom he's not
[49:35] interested in having AI Androids you
[49:39] know be part of his kingdom he wanted
[49:41] people
[49:42] who had Souls who could make a choice
[49:45] who could who could choose him you know
[49:48] I I didn't want a a wife that was forced
[49:51] to marry me I wanted a wife that chose
[49:54] to marry me you know I it's it's it's
[49:56] all about A Love Affair and and so this
[50:00] is what exactly what God wanted and him
[50:02] you know needing and his needs as a
[50:06] redeemer and as a Healer and as a savior
[50:09] to fulfill his his uh his nature and his
[50:13] characteristics I'm just so happy today
[50:16] that I got to be a part of fulfilling
[50:19] his needs you know it's interesting I've
[50:22] I've seen the you know the the the I
[50:26] don't know they want to call it their
[50:28] writings their essays or whatever of
[50:30] agnostics and atheists and I don't read
[50:32] that um and read their stuff very often
[50:35] and if I read it at all it's just to try
[50:37] to understand how they could possibly
[50:39] come to that conclusion trying to figure
[50:41] out a way I can helps see and so I get a
[50:45] little bit of gain out of it like that
[50:46] there's no chance for the devil to
[50:49] dissuade me from the word of God because
[50:52] he's already tried that back in the eons
[50:54] and he failed I was a Believer then I'm
[50:56] a Believer now I'll always be a believer
[50:58] and so because I realize that I'm part
[51:01] of the word that I'm believing and so I
[51:03] could no more deny it than I could deny
[51:05] my own self and it really wouldn't
[51:08] matter what my body would do or my brain
[51:12] or my mind or decisions in my heart I
[51:16] simply there is another another Jason
[51:19] Watkins down inside of me saying Amen to
[51:22] the word and warring against the the
[51:26] Fallen nature in my flesh to bring it
[51:28] under subjection and I'm glad to report
[51:31] to you today that I'm a Christian which
[51:33] means the real me is winning
[51:38] and I want to go on winning
[51:41] and I intend to win I intend to spend my
[51:45] life you people can the world can have
[51:47] it they want fortune and Glory have at
[51:50] it all right fine Brother Branham said
[51:52] don't even don't even you know I forget
[51:55] the word he uses the the thinking is you
[51:58] know don't don't be too hard on the on
[52:01] the center here with his cigarettes and
[52:03] his booze and his gambling and his all
[52:05] of this and brother M said that's the
[52:07] only enjoyment he's ever going to know
[52:08] he's one and done I never wanted to be
[52:11] one and done
[52:12] I I read the testimony of you know I was
[52:16] reading the other day a couple of very
[52:18] famous men one was a very famous
[52:19] politician one was a another uh
[52:23] um a movie star from back in the day and
[52:25] you know here they are neither one of
[52:27] them believe in the afterlife they just
[52:31] think that's it when you die you're done
[52:33] and I thought boy what a what a rude
[52:35] awakening you're gonna have
[52:37] one or two seconds after you die
[52:41] think about that an Awakening after you
[52:43] die
[52:44] you're gonna have a rude awakening after
[52:47] you die because no one's actually died
[52:49] yet and everyone that's ever lived in
[52:52] the earth is still alive today somewhere
[52:56] and they were asking him you know so
[52:58] what do you what are you you're old now
[53:00] what do you think about you've had all
[53:01] the fortune and glory of the world and
[53:04] uh you know you've had all the money
[53:06] women in popularity you could ever have
[53:08] and you've had enough to satisfy a
[53:10] thousand men and and and and and and now
[53:13] here you are at the end and he said and
[53:15] he actually said he said you know he
[53:16] said I'm not afraid to die he said I'm
[53:19] just I'm just mad
[53:21] I'm just mad that I have to
[53:24] and you you could see that there's a
[53:26] desire
[53:27] in him I want to keep living I don't
[53:31] want to die I love life I don't I don't
[53:34] want to see it end and I'm so glad I
[53:38] thought to myself I closed my eyes and a
[53:40] shiver went through me and I thought
[53:42] Lord I'm so glad to know that that life
[53:45] is not ended in death that there's
[53:48] another world just beyond this one
[53:50] brother Branham said a continuation of
[53:52] this same life in another place
[53:56] I'm glad for the gospel the world may
[53:58] not want it but I love it I'm glad for
[54:01] the Holy Ghost the world doesn't want it
[54:03] but I love it
[54:04] Hallelujah
[54:07] foreign
[54:08] to think that I have a part in
[54:10] Redemption and I have a pardon an
[54:14] integral part you do you have an
[54:16] integral part you know in God's Plan of
[54:18] Redemption you say can you quantify or
[54:22] unqualify just how important my part is
[54:25] the rapture can't go without you being
[54:28] in
[54:30] you're holding up if you're not in and
[54:34] you're elected to be in you're holding
[54:37] up 2 000 years of church history
[54:40] you're holding up 2 000 years worth of
[54:42] saints who are earnestly or eagerly
[54:44] waiting for their change as much as
[54:47] you're waiting here you are longing to
[54:49] be there and they're they're longing to
[54:51] be back here
[54:53] Hallelujah they want to be back in their
[54:56] bodies again they're in a word body a
[54:58] theophany body theophonic condition but
[55:00] you know they don't eat and different
[55:02] things like that but they're longing
[55:03] because they're they're not living you
[55:07] say they're in the paradise of God
[55:08] indeed but they're not living a full
[55:10] life yet see and I'm on this side and
[55:13] I've got I've got the body still that
[55:15] they would like to have again but
[55:18] they've got a condition a world that I
[55:20] would like to have I'm glad God's going
[55:23] emerge the two together and we're gonna
[55:27] live here in bodies and we're gonna
[55:29] we're we're gonna we're going to life
[55:31] we're going to live
[55:33] Hallelujah past never more to have to
[55:36] come back here and do this again and
[55:39] anguish and sin and sorrow and hardship
[55:42] and things like that I'm sorry I just
[55:45] have to keep check on that
[55:46] [Laughter]
[55:48] please don't let it distract you even if
[55:50] I just take a quick glance amen and I
[55:53] also got to make sure it doesn't start
[55:55] buzzing and dialing a number but
[55:58] but we find that
[56:01] that's how important you are the Rapture
[56:04] can't go without you
[56:06] you're holding me up and everybody up
[56:09] you're holding God up
[56:12] well there's a silver lining you're
[56:15] you're holding the Antichrist up
[56:18] because he can't begin his ride till we
[56:20] get out of here
[56:21] and if you're the last one that ain't
[56:23] surrendered yet and I'm here to tell you
[56:26] all eyes are on you I I don't want to be
[56:29] the guy on the other side that everybody
[56:31] goes boy were you really holding us up
[56:35] man we were watching and saying my
[56:38] goodness what is he waiting somebody hit
[56:40] him somebody do something
[56:45] but God
[56:47] is bringing us back from this life of
[56:49] Sorrow
[56:51] God's in the restoration business
[56:54] he's in rescue and Recovery he's the
[56:57] greatest rescue and Recovery
[56:58] organization
[57:00] that you ever heard about
[57:02] and you know Adam and Eve they were
[57:07] they were told about Redemption when God
[57:10] gave them bloody skins
[57:13] those bloody skins
[57:15] portended Redemption
[57:19] they they they were a statement where
[57:22] God is saying you know as they're going
[57:25] out and brother Branham says you know
[57:27] those those bloody skins smacking
[57:29] against their legs as they walked
[57:31] dripping with Lamb's blood
[57:33] and and God is he's saying to them how
[57:37] I've got to send you out of the garden
[57:39] you can't stay here anymore in this
[57:41] condition because the tree of life is
[57:43] here and lest you break through and
[57:45] partake of it in your Fallen condition
[57:47] and live forever and mess up the whole
[57:49] plan I'm gonna have to send you out of
[57:52] here I love you but I gotta send you out
[57:54] of my direct presence like this but I
[57:56] I've wrapped you in skins and that's my
[57:59] message of saying to you the last thing
[58:01] you hear me say as you leave the garden
[58:04] is I will bring you back
[58:09] brother Branham said when God seen his
[58:12] creation laying face down in ruin he
[58:16] said he didn't he didn't do away with it
[58:18] he said he he he he started immediately
[58:22] building it back because he's God and he
[58:25] won't be defeated
[58:27] Hallelujah I'm so glad today that he
[58:31] can't be defeated because I get defeated
[58:33] all the time but he can't be defeated
[58:39] and so
[58:41] this is this means a lot to us
[58:45] as we hear Brother Brannon
[58:48] like only a prophet could
[58:50] you know it takes a prophet to go into
[58:53] the mind of God and go all the way back
[58:55] to the to the back parts of God's mind
[58:57] and even even way back I mean it took a
[59:00] profit to discern the Sacred Hearts of
[59:03] Lucifer
[59:04] when when the prophet says oh I got your
[59:07] number loose the first son of the
[59:09] morning
[59:10] how are you falling from Heaven you
[59:12] think you're hiding your intention I'm
[59:13] about to out you to the whole world I'm
[59:15] going to put in a book and it's going to
[59:17] be the best seller for all the all the
[59:19] history
[59:21] no Prophet don't do
[59:23] it secretly I'm gonna tell them
[59:25] you said
[59:28] you set up don't don't that's that's top
[59:30] secret you have no right you said in
[59:33] your heart I will Ascend I will be like
[59:37] the most high God I'll establish my
[59:40] kingdom in the north and and and and and
[59:43] and that's what you are intending to do
[59:45] and here today friends I'm here to tell
[59:48] you you've got access to the very
[59:50] thoughts and intents just like they told
[59:53] the king of Syria when he goes down
[59:55] trying to find it uh Elisha and and uh
[59:58] and every every time you know he goes
[1:00:00] against Israel to fight him to entrap
[1:00:02] them Elisha just goes and tells the king
[1:00:04] here's where they are here's what
[1:00:06] they're going to do you can go around
[1:00:08] come up around and surround them I mean
[1:00:09] you're talking about a hack
[1:00:11] and he's like hacking life
[1:00:14] he's hacked the whole Army and the next
[1:00:16] thing you know serious losing tens of
[1:00:18] thousands of men until the king says who
[1:00:20] is a traitor Among Us and thankfully
[1:00:22] there was somebody that had enough
[1:00:24] courage to say your majesty ain't none
[1:00:27] of us traitors but Israel has a prophet
[1:00:30] who tells the king of Israel what you're
[1:00:33] thinking in your bed chamber

[1:00:39] Syria for a minute you concoct a plan

[1:01:04] off and sends an army I'm thinking wow I
[1:01:08] wouldn't want to be the general who gets
[1:01:09] the order to go down and capture a man
[1:01:11] who knows what we're doing and knows
[1:01:13] we're coming
[1:01:15] and then when he finds them Elisha just
[1:01:18] blinds them
[1:01:19] he don't have to do anything he don't
[1:01:21] have to pick up his sword his poof okay
[1:01:22] you're blind walks right out and talks
[1:01:24] to him let him know who he is
[1:01:25] oh you're looking for Elisha oh come on
[1:01:27] I'll show you where he's at
[1:01:30] and he you know gets a message to the
[1:01:32] king hey I'm going to lead him right
[1:01:34] into the Trap set it up no I'll I'll
[1:01:36] lead him right in and I'll get out of
[1:01:37] the way and you can spring the Trap and
[1:01:38] you got them
[1:01:40] oh my so so God
[1:01:45] so you've got a prophet now coming to us
[1:01:48] to say
[1:01:49] I know the secret
[1:01:52] in the back part of God's mind
[1:01:55] wow Elijah do tell well the first thing
[1:02:01] you need to know is God only has one
[1:02:05] motive and objective
[1:02:07] one goal in all the Bible
[1:02:12] really yes
[1:02:14] 66 books covering thousands of years yep
[1:02:18] one goal yep
[1:02:20] what is it expression
[1:02:24] all the people and all the Bible and
[1:02:27] everything you've ever read in the Bible
[1:02:29] is all God leading to one thing
[1:02:33] expression
[1:02:35] did he pull it off he did
[1:02:37] the prophets priests and kings were
[1:02:41] living out in real time
[1:02:44] portions of their life that that
[1:02:47] literally foretold what Christ would be
[1:02:50] when he arrived when God became flesh
[1:02:53] that's why it wasn't hard for the family
[1:02:57] of God who believed the word of God to
[1:03:00] identify it when it became flesh
[1:03:03] because it meant it matched it had the
[1:03:06] same nature it spoke the same way said
[1:03:10] the same things Jesus said to the
[1:03:13] religious leaders of his day why is it
[1:03:15] you don't understand my speech
[1:03:18] why are my words strange to you he was
[1:03:22] doing nothing but repeating everything
[1:03:24] they claimed to have studied since
[1:03:26] children
[1:03:27] and here he was the living
[1:03:29] representative of it
[1:03:31] he was actually all of the word they had
[1:03:34] studied in a human it was all summed up
[1:03:36] in a man
[1:03:37] and and the family of God says that's
[1:03:41] the Messiah who didn't say that I am
[1:03:43] this that or the other but who do you
[1:03:44] say they are the Son of God but those
[1:03:46] and even Devils even when he come to
[1:03:49] Legion even those Devils Cried Out Jesus
[1:03:53] thou Son of God
[1:03:55] see
[1:03:56] the family of God recognized him Devils
[1:03:59] recognized him they knew that that he
[1:04:01] had defeated them they didn't hadn't
[1:04:03] forgotten that
[1:04:05] but the religious leaders of the day
[1:04:07] called him be Elizabeth not just the
[1:04:09] devil the chief of devils
[1:04:13] and so so you find then that that that
[1:04:17] now a prophet says see it was all that
[1:04:21] his goal his one single goal
[1:04:25] has been distributed in three stages
[1:04:30] right
[1:04:31] first to make himself fully known in
[1:04:34] Jesus Christ
[1:04:36] the complete encapsulation of all the
[1:04:39] prophets priests and kings second was to
[1:04:42] gain preeminence in his church through
[1:04:46] the Holy Ghost see now everything that
[1:04:49] brother Branham is telling us
[1:04:52] top secret Intel
[1:04:55] everything he said is historical
[1:04:59] he be everything in Christ and then for
[1:05:02] two thousand years he gained preeminence
[1:05:04] in his church
[1:05:06] well that's that was then but this is
[1:05:08] now brother Branham what about now glad
[1:05:11] you asked the third part the final part
[1:05:14] the finishing part are you glad to be
[1:05:17] part of the finishing part
[1:05:18] the finishing part is to restore the
[1:05:22] kingdom that's you and me
[1:05:26] to restore the kingdom to its rightly
[1:05:30] position that fell by sin in the garden
[1:05:33] back in Adams day back under the first
[1:05:35] Adam now listen friends this is exactly
[1:05:38] why the you know the upper room
[1:05:41] experience when you have it you say
[1:05:43] praise God I've been redeemed you have
[1:05:45] part of you has but I'm not I'm I'm not
[1:05:50] satisfied neither is God satisfied with
[1:05:52] having a part of me redeemed he's trying
[1:05:55] to bring you in your body as the real
[1:05:59] you as the complete you not a part of
[1:06:01] you to bring you back to what you would
[1:06:04] have been in the garden before it fell
[1:06:08] you're not going that's why brother
[1:06:11] Branham said Canaan was not the
[1:06:13] Millennium because they still have
[1:06:15] thought and had War where you're going
[1:06:17] there'll be no war
[1:06:22] you won't have to fight anymore oh glory
[1:06:25] be to God he's restoring me back to
[1:06:29] where the greatest battle that's ever
[1:06:31] fought has been won and done
[1:06:38] now that's in process right now and
[1:06:42] that's already
[1:06:44] having an effect not just affecting
[1:06:49] where we can sit here today and be glad
[1:06:51] and rejoice that God is and we get
[1:06:53] affected by the fact that it's bringing
[1:06:55] my body subject but that's an effect
[1:06:57] that's God affecting change places you
[1:07:01] used to go you don't anymore that's an
[1:07:05] effective change
[1:07:07] things you used to say and do you didn't
[1:07:10] just get affected you got affected
[1:07:13] God has affected change I want you to
[1:07:17] know he ain't done
[1:07:21] Hallelujah is right you should be glad
[1:07:23] and rejoice because he ain't done he's
[1:07:26] still working on me he's still working
[1:07:29] on you this is what keeps me going on a
[1:07:32] daily basis I regret my failures I do
[1:07:35] you do we do all together but he ain't
[1:07:37] done and I'm still going forward and
[1:07:40] that's the important thing that you keep
[1:07:42] going forward
[1:07:46] it's not about perfection it's about
[1:07:49] progress
[1:07:51] we're coming to Perfection you can't
[1:07:54] finish the last part of it brother Tim
[1:07:56] was preaching on that Friday night if
[1:07:58] you didn't hear any of the dedication
[1:08:00] meetings in Tennessee he was preaching
[1:08:01] about how that Moses built the
[1:08:04] Tabernacle and the Bible says and Moses
[1:08:06] completed all the work that he was
[1:08:08] assigned to do and it was finished it's
[1:08:10] like Solomon finished
[1:08:12] but but but the Tabernacle wasn't
[1:08:14] finished
[1:08:16] it wasn't finished until it was filled
[1:08:18] with the glory of God Solomon did all he
[1:08:22] could do in building the Temple but it
[1:08:24] wasn't Solomon was finished Moses was
[1:08:26] finished they had done all they could do
[1:08:28] but it wasn't finished God had to fill
[1:08:31] it with Glory we're serving and we're
[1:08:33] doing all we can but I still can't
[1:08:35] change my body but there's somebody that
[1:08:38] can
[1:08:39] [Applause]
[1:08:40] you can repent of your sins you can
[1:08:42] start cleaning up your life you can do
[1:08:45] all that you can do but you still need
[1:08:47] the glory of God to fill your vessel
[1:08:53] you're not born again until you do we
[1:08:55] didn't you know when you think about the
[1:08:58] early church
[1:09:01] you didn't have a church until the Holy
[1:09:03] Ghost came
[1:09:04] you had people Gathering
[1:09:07] she didn't have a church
[1:09:08] because the church is the Ecclesia the
[1:09:11] the church was the continuation of his
[1:09:13] life
[1:09:14] and so
[1:09:16] I want you to think now what God
[1:09:19] is restoring you too say can you line it
[1:09:22] out for me in really good detail I can
[1:09:25] and it's easy all right because I can
[1:09:28] take you back on a little journey and
[1:09:31] you'll easily go with me in your mind's
[1:09:34] eye to see what say how will I see what
[1:09:38] I would have been
[1:09:39] had there not been a fall by looking at
[1:09:41] Adam before the fall
[1:09:45] and there's three things that I want to
[1:09:47] point out to you today
[1:09:49] that Adam
[1:09:51] was unique
[1:09:53] from you
[1:09:55] first of all
[1:09:57] Adam had nothing behind him
[1:10:03] no no parents back there who
[1:10:07] had this complex or this problem and it
[1:10:10] jumped two generations and fell on me
[1:10:12] nothing from a distant uncle or a
[1:10:15] distant brother Ram talked about strains
[1:10:16] in a family remember that remember the
[1:10:18] young man who had who is engaged and he
[1:10:21] became rigid and and and and and and he
[1:10:24] had insulted and his fiancee and he he
[1:10:27] was in the wrong dead to rights and he
[1:10:29] and he wouldn't apologize he wouldn't
[1:10:30] repent because his his mother's family
[1:10:33] had been like that now his mom wasn't
[1:10:35] see but brother Brandon when he's it's
[1:10:38] brother Adam's nephew and he's there
[1:10:39] with his brother saying look here's the
[1:10:41] problem he said he's got this thing that
[1:10:44] come on him at Birth and said it come
[1:10:47] through the mother and there she's
[1:10:48] sitting there he said now not you sister
[1:10:50] the Holy Ghost made you different the
[1:10:52] Holy Ghost took all that out of you but
[1:10:54] look at how your family is you walk down
[1:10:57] the street and wave at him they don't
[1:10:58] wave back you walk up to the fence he
[1:11:00] said I've walked up to the fence and
[1:11:01] said mighty nice day they just stare at
[1:11:04] me
[1:11:05] and he said I say well I hope to see at
[1:11:08] church sometime God bless you and he
[1:11:09] said they just stare you
[1:11:11] it was like an arrogance and they there
[1:11:13] that strain runs in that family and he
[1:11:16] said to his brother he said now look
[1:11:18] come on you know as well as I know we
[1:11:21] our whole families Fighters and
[1:11:22] drunkards and killers and thieves and no
[1:11:25] good and Bootleggers he said but now
[1:11:27] you're not like that why why because the
[1:11:30] Holy Ghost broke the cycle
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:34] oh I love it that the Holy Ghost can
[1:11:36] break that cycle
[1:11:38] but we still have to fight those are
[1:11:40] things that are strains that run in
[1:11:42] families that you have to keep you have
[1:11:44] certain propensities that that you were
[1:11:47] born with you know I mean the these and
[1:11:49] I've there's a whole sermon I don't want
[1:11:51] to get into that because I'm still
[1:11:53] planning my family values uh series and
[1:11:55] and I don't want to go too far down that
[1:11:57] path but but but those kinds of strains
[1:12:00] you know get on just like I I've said
[1:12:03] you know to you before just in one
[1:12:05] example you know there's there's many
[1:12:08] vices that have had tremendous sway in
[1:12:12] my life before the Lord got a hold of my
[1:12:13] life but one of them wasn't gambling
[1:12:16] now that's a disease of that's a demon
[1:12:19] men I've been around men like that and
[1:12:22] they can't resist it they'll they'll
[1:12:24] gamble on on anything
[1:12:27] unless God delivers them
[1:12:29] and so but that was not I I I told you a
[1:12:32] funny story how I played a a game of
[1:12:34] poker and cards one time and I lost like
[1:12:37] a dollar and 85 Cent I was mad for days
[1:12:40] I couldn't believe it somebody had my
[1:12:43] 1.85 and I earned it and and I what an
[1:12:47] idiot see
[1:12:49] so it's not something that would get me
[1:12:53] because I don't have that propensity
[1:12:56] but I did have propensity to other
[1:12:58] weaknesses
[1:12:59] see and so you know there's even the
[1:13:03] thing today you know in the in the in
[1:13:06] the in the whole boy I'm just I don't
[1:13:08] know why I keep getting pulled in this I
[1:13:09] don't want to go this way but but you
[1:13:12] know just that if it might help you
[1:13:14] you know there's there's the whole
[1:13:19] political ideology there's not really
[1:13:21] any scientific data too much to to prove
[1:13:25] it and although all those scientific
[1:13:27] data does show elements of it about you
[1:13:30] know men who live perverted Lifestyles
[1:13:32] and women who live perverted lifestyles
[1:13:34] in in same-sex relationships and we're
[1:13:38] just quick to say oh that's just a devil
[1:13:41] well nobody's born like that well you'd
[1:13:44] first of all you've got to understand
[1:13:46] yes that is a devil but it's a devil who
[1:13:50] has taken advantage of an of a
[1:13:52] propensity in the nature of that person
[1:13:55] now that is scientifically proven it's
[1:13:59] not nobody's born homosexual but there
[1:14:03] are people who can't be born with that
[1:14:06] effeminate slant listen brother Branham
[1:14:08] talked about the food we eat and hybrid
[1:14:12] he says is is actually metamorphosing he
[1:14:16] says you notice that that that that men
[1:14:19] that women are getting narrow in the
[1:14:21] hips and men are having the vice versa
[1:14:23] and he actually talked about how that
[1:14:25] it's altering the DNA
[1:14:28] and he said the food is killing us it's
[1:14:31] literally wiping out a generation uh
[1:14:33] Generations it's it's leading to an
[1:14:35] Extinction event so these things are
[1:14:38] real we're not afraid of that we're just
[1:14:39] aware that's why I pray over everything
[1:14:41] I eat
[1:14:43] the power of prayer sanctifies it but
[1:14:45] but you have to realize that this world
[1:14:47] and brother Branham even talked about
[1:14:49] the incense he said it's it's our bodies
[1:14:53] are you know he talked about men back in
[1:14:55] the day who could fight 110 rounds in a
[1:14:57] heavyweight boxing match bare knuckled
[1:15:01] and around wasn't a timer you didn't get
[1:15:03] Saved by the Bell around was when you
[1:15:05] knocked the man off his feet that ended
[1:15:07] around you started another one and that
[1:15:09] fight 110 knockdowns till the till one
[1:15:12] of the men couldn't get up anymore
[1:15:14] he said Burly rugged many and he said
[1:15:17] today even men you find them in perfect
[1:15:21] physical fitness and strong and in the
[1:15:24] military and one Blow To The Head and
[1:15:26] they're gone
[1:15:28] and dying 40 and 50 years old just
[1:15:31] dropping dead men's Hearts failing for
[1:15:33] fear the world is is done
[1:15:37] Nature's done Nature's ready to get on
[1:15:40] with the new world
[1:15:42] that's why I've said to you young people
[1:15:45] your some of you are are going to
[1:15:47] college now whatever you do don't let
[1:15:50] those propaganda institutions pull you
[1:15:53] away from the mind of God and make you
[1:15:56] chase fortune and Glory this world is
[1:15:59] going to Ash and Cinder and you can't
[1:16:02] keep it you it's burning down you can't
[1:16:04] stay here
[1:16:06] we got to have a new world and a new
[1:16:09] body
[1:16:13] you look toward the manifestation of the
[1:16:16] word of God
[1:16:18] you're not always going to be able to
[1:16:19] understand Doctrine
[1:16:22] that's the advantage of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:24] you don't even need to
[1:16:26] the Holy Ghost can make you a new
[1:16:28] creation the Holy Ghost can show you
[1:16:30] ways you look for manifestation friends
[1:16:32] I'm not talking about chasing signs and
[1:16:34] wonders although that's an element of it
[1:16:36] brother Branham talked about the three
[1:16:38] definite evidences of what God called
[1:16:40] Ministries number one it'll be a
[1:16:42] Ministry established squarely on the
[1:16:43] word and it won't deviate it'll say Amen
[1:16:46] to every word and it'll only say what
[1:16:48] the word says it'll receive I'm here to
[1:16:50] tell you a god-sent ministry will
[1:16:52] receive the Elijah Ministry of this day
[1:16:54] period hands down and it will say what
[1:16:57] he said
[1:16:59] I'm not a parent I don't repeat just
[1:17:01] what he said I'm an eagle but I do
[1:17:03] preach what he taught
[1:17:05] secondly it will have signs following it
[1:17:08] and boy do we have some signs following
[1:17:11] we've had them right here in this little
[1:17:14] Church by the seaside how many
[1:17:16] miraculous things God has done
[1:17:19] it's appearing Cancers and opening up
[1:17:22] deaf ears and people be coming back to
[1:17:24] health again I'm not afraid to put the
[1:17:27] testimony of Jesus Christ to the test at
[1:17:29] Bethel Tabernacle and thirdly is the
[1:17:32] evident fruit
[1:17:34] the evident fruit
[1:17:36] of that life that we live
[1:17:39] and and that's that that is what is so
[1:17:42] profoundly important
[1:17:44] see is that you you can see the evidence
[1:17:47] of what God has done
[1:17:49] So Adam here's the beauty
[1:17:52] Adam had nothing behind him
[1:17:56] nothing to haunt him
[1:17:59] no Strain coming from somebody behind
[1:18:01] him that landed on him
[1:18:04] Adam had nothing behind him
[1:18:07] Adam had nothing upon him
[1:18:10] Satan couldn't come and accuse him of
[1:18:12] all the mistakes he had made like he can
[1:18:14] me like he can you
[1:18:16] like he does me like he does you
[1:18:20] amen none of that he had nothing upon
[1:18:24] him he had never forsaken God's word he
[1:18:26] had never committed a transgression in
[1:18:29] fact it is even the transgression he did
[1:18:31] was to save his wife
[1:18:33] out of love portraying Christ Christ
[1:18:37] also took your sin upon himself and
[1:18:39] became a sinner he who knew no sin just
[1:18:43] like Adam he who knew no sin became sin
[1:18:46] for Eve see and so so we realized that
[1:18:49] that that that it that protected Eve
[1:18:52] that saved her life God once Adam took
[1:18:55] Eve to himself and and mingled his seed
[1:18:58] in her body then God then now a part of
[1:19:02] Adam is actually physically inside her
[1:19:04] and God can't touch her
[1:19:07] she ought to have been burnt with the
[1:19:09] serpent that's what the prophet says but
[1:19:11] God couldn't put a hand on her just like
[1:19:13] Abraham now God hears Sarah and Sarah
[1:19:16] laughs and disbelieves the word of God
[1:19:18] by right she should have died
[1:19:21] but see but but but what saved say she
[1:19:24] was part of Abraham that savior that's
[1:19:26] accurate but brother Branham takes it a
[1:19:28] layer deeper is that she also believed
[1:19:32] the promise that Abraham spoke said God
[1:19:35] said to me and Sarah said I believe that
[1:19:37] I'm here to tell you God gave a
[1:19:39] revelation of Jesus Christ and he gave
[1:19:41] it to the church and the church says I
[1:19:43] believe it
[1:19:44] [Applause]
[1:19:46] and it was her faith in the promise just
[1:19:49] like Abraham it wasn't just that she was
[1:19:52] his wife she believed the promise
[1:19:56] that's what is your salvation friends
[1:19:58] that you believe the promise you have
[1:20:01] received the word that God has sent in
[1:20:04] this hour and you're not a make-believer
[1:20:06] you really believe it
[1:20:09] you don't always achieve it but you do
[1:20:11] believe it
[1:20:16] Adam had nothing behind him that's what
[1:20:18] God's restoring you to
[1:20:21] I'm so glad for that he had nothing on
[1:20:23] him
[1:20:24] and he had nothing within him
[1:20:27] he wasn't born in sin he had no Fallen
[1:20:30] nature just like Jesus when he told the
[1:20:33] disciples he says let us go
[1:20:36] Satan cometh but findeth nothing in me
[1:20:40] oh he had tried
[1:20:42] he had he had tried those Pharisees
[1:20:46] stood there and tried to do not deny his
[1:20:48] birth tried to go back and you know
[1:20:50] tried to go back and say you're just a
[1:20:52] man you're just a carpenter's son we
[1:20:55] know your dad we know your mom you're
[1:20:57] nobody you've even got a a smutty name
[1:20:59] about how you came into the Earth and
[1:21:01] what your mother did so and so and so
[1:21:02] and so and so and what they're simply
[1:21:05] saying to him is you're no different
[1:21:06] than us
[1:21:08] but that wasn't true
[1:21:10] Jesus had nothing behind him but God
[1:21:14] nothing upon him but but the word and
[1:21:17] nothing within him but pure faith I'm
[1:21:20] here to tell you something friends
[1:21:21] that's what God is spending 24 hours a
[1:21:25] day seven days a week to take you back
[1:21:27] and I just say thanks be to God I'm
[1:21:30] headed where there's nothing behind me
[1:21:32] and I don't have to worry about the
[1:21:34] strange or the complexes I don't have to
[1:21:37] worry about the propensities or the
[1:21:39] weaknesses there's nothing upon me he
[1:21:42] can't accuse me anymore it's all under
[1:21:44] the blood
[1:21:46] Hallelujah I'm Justified as though I
[1:21:49] never did in the first place and there's
[1:21:51] nothing within me I have passed from
[1:21:54] Death to life and I am a new creation
[1:22:03] God is constantly
[1:22:06] telling his family this all down through
[1:22:09] the scriptures he makes it very clear
[1:22:13] he says to Moses you're going to go and
[1:22:16] get the children and you're going to
[1:22:19] come back to this mountain Moses
[1:22:22] right here
[1:22:23] where I'm meeting you you're going to
[1:22:25] come back here Moses
[1:22:27] and you're going to bring those people
[1:22:28] with you at that point Moses needed to
[1:22:33] worry about nothing
[1:22:37] when he went to pharaoh and Pharaoh went
[1:22:40] and do it that didn't rattle Moses when
[1:22:44] the people got rattled and threatened to
[1:22:46] Stone him that didn't rattling
[1:22:49] nothing mattered to Moses because Moses
[1:22:52] knew I've already got a date with
[1:22:56] Destiny I'm coming back to that mountain
[1:22:59] and I'm bringing these people with me
[1:23:02] he told Jacob the same thing you'll come
[1:23:05] back here Jacob you're making a promise
[1:23:07] that you're going to serve me and I'm
[1:23:09] going to be your God and I'm going to
[1:23:11] bring you back there was a ladder and he
[1:23:13] sees angels in ascending and descending
[1:23:15] and there's the Son of God standing at
[1:23:16] the top of it talking to him I'm going
[1:23:18] to bring you back here Jacob I'm going
[1:23:20] to tell you something there were times
[1:23:21] in Jacob's life where it didn't feel
[1:23:23] very much like that there were times in
[1:23:25] his life he's running for his life he's
[1:23:27] running scared he's having to sneak and
[1:23:30] and connive and and be a scoundrel just
[1:23:33] just to live it doesn't feel very much
[1:23:35] like he's under the blessing of God it
[1:23:37] felt like he was in a prison why you
[1:23:39] think he wanted to leave and snuck out
[1:23:41] in the middle of the night
[1:23:43] and he's running for it trying to get a
[1:23:45] head start he knows his father-in-law
[1:23:46] chasing down and so he's running with
[1:23:48] his wives and his children and and the
[1:23:51] cattle that he had gotten through deceit
[1:23:53] and all this kind of thing and finally
[1:23:55] he gets a word and here comes Esau and
[1:23:57] he's coming to kill him and Jacob had to
[1:23:59] wrestle it out with the angel but here's
[1:24:01] what he knew that he promised me he'll
[1:24:04] bring me back I'm coming back that one
[1:24:07] that spoke to me and made me a promise
[1:24:08] you're here today I'm here today and he
[1:24:11] made me a promise that that there's a
[1:24:13] that he go went away to prepare a home
[1:24:15] for me that where he would be I could be
[1:24:17] also and in this life it doesn't always
[1:24:20] feel like that and sometimes I wonder
[1:24:22] can I even make it but I got a promise
[1:24:25] I got a promise he'll bring me back
[1:24:31] and he is bringing me back
[1:24:34] Israel was told as a nation
[1:24:37] you good
[1:24:41] Israel was told as a nation he would
[1:24:43] restore them he would heal them
[1:24:46] he said I know my plans for you plans of
[1:24:48] good not of harm
[1:24:51] I'm going to restore all the years
[1:24:54] that the canker worm and the caterpillar
[1:24:56] and the locus and the Palm worm
[1:24:58] have done my Army that I sent among you
[1:25:04] see so how many how many had in here had
[1:25:09] loyal parents that sent belts and
[1:25:11] Hickory switches among you
[1:25:22] amen
[1:25:24] all of these things that I sent among
[1:25:27] you
[1:25:28] but I
[1:25:30] but I know my plans for you
[1:25:34] and sometimes I know that life can get
[1:25:37] into such a situation and you wonder at
[1:25:40] your own self and you wonder at God and
[1:25:42] and as a human being brother Branham
[1:25:44] actually brother Brandon wasn't afraid
[1:25:47] to put it on put it put it in brass
[1:25:49] tacks and say you know we need to be
[1:25:51] able to see you know who is God
[1:25:56] and even if there is a God
[1:26:00] then let him come and prove himself
[1:26:02] and God would come night after night
[1:26:04] Prophet wasn't afraid to challenge just
[1:26:06] like Elijah you know Let The God Who
[1:26:09] Answers by fire
[1:26:12] and so Elijah had very little concern
[1:26:15] when he's filling the trench full of H2O
[1:26:19] and he's soaking the wood and soaking
[1:26:22] the sacrifice and after they're done he
[1:26:25] tells them do it again and do it again
[1:26:27] and keep doing it because it ain't gonna
[1:26:30] matter
[1:26:32] the fire that's coming ain't going to be
[1:26:34] stopped by science
[1:26:36] the fire that's coming nothing let me
[1:26:39] tell you something friends nor whatever
[1:26:41] happened in your past whatever kind of
[1:26:43] strain you were born with whatever was
[1:26:44] on your life whatever kind of Fallen
[1:26:46] nature nothing was going to stop the
[1:26:49] fire of the Holy Ghost from coming down
[1:26:52] and burning up the sacrifice
[1:26:57] I will restore you I'll bring you back
[1:26:59] brother Branham says in a paradox
[1:27:04] he says we find that among human beings
[1:27:08] we're prone to be that way he's talking
[1:27:10] about people wanting wanting something
[1:27:12] to do in it Israel wanted a law
[1:27:16] people always want to mess things up and
[1:27:19] figure out how they can work out their
[1:27:21] salvation you know with Works which you
[1:27:24] can't do
[1:27:25] and you know I'm I I'm I'm I've said it
[1:27:29] before
[1:27:30] that I'm very glad to know and and can
[1:27:33] prove by the Bible
[1:27:35] that not everybody that goes into the
[1:27:37] tribulation is going to hell
[1:27:40] the righteous King who loves life and
[1:27:42] loves Mercy whose Throne is established
[1:27:44] in Mercy is going to Grant some people
[1:27:47] eternal life at the end of at the
[1:27:48] Judgment bar
[1:27:50] it's his prerogative
[1:27:52] and it's not going to be based on works
[1:27:55] it's gonna because when they ask Jesus
[1:27:58] how do we work the works of God he said
[1:28:00] believe on him whom God hath sent that
[1:28:03] was the work that he needed you to do so
[1:28:06] when you read Matthew 25 you're not
[1:28:08] you're not seeing people get in because
[1:28:10] of a balance scale that they got 946
[1:28:14] good and only 819 bad so they get to go
[1:28:17] in it's not that you can't get eternal
[1:28:19] life like that it's the king fortunately
[1:28:21] thank God knows the heart of the people
[1:28:24] thank God he knows your heart thank God
[1:28:27] he knows that even when you fail you
[1:28:28] still love him
[1:28:30] thank God he knows when you fail you'll
[1:28:32] repent because you didn't want to fail
[1:28:33] in the first place
[1:28:35] that's why he's so quick to forgive you
[1:28:37] it's why he's faithful if we confess our
[1:28:39] sins he's faithful and just to forgive
[1:28:41] us because he knows we didn't mean to do
[1:28:42] it anyway
[1:28:43] see and so say well but my flesh My
[1:28:48] Flesh did want it but your flesh ain't
[1:28:50] the real you
[1:28:51] your flesh is a hybrid Hallelujah the
[1:28:54] real you didn't want to do it else why'd
[1:28:56] you repent
[1:28:57] proves you didn't really want to do that
[1:28:59] friends I there's nothing in me that
[1:29:01] loves sin I'm done with sin I'm done
[1:29:03] with the world all my desires for the
[1:29:05] world are gone
[1:29:09] sure I still have fleshly temptations
[1:29:11] that I have to keep keep and Paul said I
[1:29:14] beat my body under subjection and and
[1:29:17] and so we we find that that now you you
[1:29:21] come to a place where where God is is
[1:29:24] changing you and he's molding you and
[1:29:27] and the thing that that gains them
[1:29:29] eternal life is the king can look into
[1:29:32] their heart
[1:29:33] and the only work he's looking for
[1:29:39] is what was your heart's response to the
[1:29:42] word when it was presented to you in
[1:29:45] whatever form
[1:29:48] if you weren't elected to see the
[1:29:50] message you can never see it anyway
[1:29:52] that's a that's his election that's God
[1:29:54] that doesn't mean they can't get eternal
[1:29:56] life they can be granted eternal life
[1:29:59] based on their that's why brother
[1:30:01] Brandon would say many will get in
[1:30:02] because they were kind to the bride
[1:30:04] what what were they doing they didn't
[1:30:06] understand the doctrine they wouldn't
[1:30:08] have understood it if you'd have tried
[1:30:09] or believed it or followed it if you
[1:30:11] tried to explain it to him but they saw
[1:30:13] you
[1:30:14] and they knew you're something more than
[1:30:16] they are and they respected that
[1:30:19] and oftentimes so it's so it's it's
[1:30:21] coming down to your heart's response and
[1:30:24] that's why many of them are going to
[1:30:26] fill up the new Earth having having
[1:30:29] freshly been freshly minted with eternal
[1:30:31] life boom enter into the joys of the
[1:30:34] Lord boom enter into the joys of the
[1:30:37] Lord prepared for you from the
[1:30:38] foundation of the world from the
[1:30:40] foundation
[1:30:41] meaning that when God started recording
[1:30:43] time his predestination knew who all
[1:30:44] that would be but that's not the elected
[1:30:47] the elected Jesus and the bride are the
[1:30:51] only ones in the entire Bible who were
[1:30:53] elected before the foundation of the
[1:30:56] world
[1:30:57] that's that's the only time you find
[1:30:58] that two scriptures two of them refer to
[1:31:01] Christ and one of them is in Ephesians
[1:31:02] refers to the bride you were elected in
[1:31:05] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:31:07] world because you you didn't get chosen
[1:31:10] you are an expression of him
[1:31:12] that's why real election understood
[1:31:15] correctly his origin
[1:31:17] it's not a lottery it's not a fortunate
[1:31:20] you got picked or you were good enough
[1:31:21] it has nothing to do with that it's
[1:31:23] expression I didn't my sons didn't
[1:31:26] choose to be my sons they are by birth
[1:31:29] and that's not unfair to the rest of the
[1:31:31] world that's just nature that is so that
[1:31:33] so but it's but but it's those who were
[1:31:35] in Christ he's there's only one elected
[1:31:38] son according to Isaiah 42 I was in him
[1:31:41] that's how I'm elected see
[1:31:43] so brother Branham says we find that
[1:31:45] among human beings speaking about trying
[1:31:48] to earn your way trying to do works
[1:31:51] we're prone to be that way now there's
[1:31:53] something there's a strain
[1:31:56] say that's something behind me man
[1:31:58] that's that's behind you all the way
[1:32:01] back to Fallen Adam
[1:32:02] that's what Adam did try to get fig
[1:32:05] leaves as soon as he fell he tried to do
[1:32:08] that that's on you from Adam that makes
[1:32:11] that's a human being see we're prone to
[1:32:14] be that way there is something we've got
[1:32:17] to do
[1:32:18] we feel that we've got to have something
[1:32:21] in it also now watch this brother
[1:32:22] Branham says you do have something into
[1:32:25] it that's your surrender of your own
[1:32:29] will your own ideas to the will and idea
[1:32:33] of almighty God and its finished
[1:32:38] you have the beautiful reality today to
[1:32:43] agree with the word of God from your
[1:32:46] heart and say now remember amen remember
[1:32:49] what that means so be it that you have
[1:32:52] the ability today to say Lord as
[1:32:55] unworthy as I am whatever I read in your
[1:32:59] word from my heart I say so be it unto
[1:33:03] me I don't care what you have to do I
[1:33:07] don't care what you have to change I
[1:33:09] don't care what you have to take from me
[1:33:12] I don't care what trials I go through I
[1:33:15] don't care what heart breaks I don't
[1:33:17] care what I have to separate from I
[1:33:20] might have an entire lifetime and career
[1:33:23] invested in my good life and the Lord
[1:33:27] may take every last bit of it from you
[1:33:29] and give you something else and you have
[1:33:32] the ability today to say amen
[1:33:35] amen so be it unto me Hallelujah
[1:33:40] that's a privilege you couldn't do that
[1:33:43] if it wasn't for the Holy Ghost you
[1:33:46] couldn't do that if you didn't have a
[1:33:48] gene of God down on the inside of you
[1:33:52] oh my
[1:33:55] so we so we find
[1:33:58] brother Brown goes on here he says you
[1:34:01] do have something
[1:34:02] and that is Your Surrender of your own
[1:34:05] will your own ideas to the will and idea
[1:34:08] of almighty God and it's finished
[1:34:10] you say is that all there is
[1:34:14] I've got an answer for that
[1:34:16] just ask me is that all there is ready
[1:34:18] is that all there is I want you to do it
[1:34:21] louder is that all there is
[1:34:23] that's all there is
[1:34:27] that's all there is
[1:34:30] just take his promise
[1:34:32] don't think of nothing else
[1:34:34] walk by it
[1:34:36] and God does the rest of it
[1:34:40] Moses could build that Tabernacle
[1:34:43] Solomon could build that Temple but God
[1:34:46] had to finish it
[1:34:48] see brother Branham talks about you know
[1:34:51] that uh
[1:34:52] he says new wine skins I'm gonna just
[1:34:54] have to find a pausing place here and
[1:34:56] pick it up next time
[1:34:58] but it just Thrills me
[1:35:01] because we we talk about brother REM
[1:35:03] goes on I'm not going to read it but he
[1:35:05] he talks about how that
[1:35:07] and you've heard it before you can't
[1:35:08] take you know put you can't put new wine
[1:35:12] in old wine skins because they burst
[1:35:16] because they're old and brutal they've
[1:35:18] already stretched as far as they can and
[1:35:19] now they're old and brittle and can't
[1:35:20] stretch and new wine ferments and
[1:35:23] expands
[1:35:24] and so it burst the old wine skin see
[1:35:28] and so so you have to have a new wine
[1:35:32] skin now watch this now because brother
[1:35:35] Branham says he says God does the rest
[1:35:39] of it he he starts talking about how
[1:35:42] that uh let me see if I can find it here
[1:35:45] yeah he says
[1:35:47] anything that you try to do within
[1:35:51] yourself
[1:35:52] it'll always work to your dishonor
[1:35:56] it'll work to your disadvantage just
[1:35:59] simply believe God and that settles it
[1:36:03] and here at the end time brother Branham
[1:36:06] says we meet the same thing again face
[1:36:09] to face we're talking about everybody's
[1:36:11] got to have a denomination everybody's
[1:36:12] got to have a work everybody's got to
[1:36:13] have this that or the other and he says
[1:36:16] we meet the same thing again face to
[1:36:17] face oh it's up to the Methodist the
[1:36:19] Baptist the Presbyterians and what more
[1:36:21] see you can't go on you've got to come
[1:36:25] back to the entire Full Gospel
[1:36:30] Paul talks about that
[1:36:32] Paul talks about that there is a a Grace
[1:36:37] that a special Grace
[1:36:39] that is to be released to you
[1:36:43] who are people of the end time and I'm
[1:36:46] not it's not an exact wording in the
[1:36:48] scripture but that's the essence of the
[1:36:50] teaching
[1:36:51] that you're to look for it
[1:36:53] that as we come to the end time you're
[1:36:55] to look for a Grace that is to be given
[1:37:01] now
[1:37:03] you only get there's only one of two
[1:37:06] things that that can be true about that
[1:37:08] either it's a Grace that's never been
[1:37:12] given which I immediately say
[1:37:15] um can't be because all the fullness of
[1:37:18] the godhead bodily was met in Jesus
[1:37:20] Christ and there's no Grace greater than
[1:37:23] the grace of Christ that he can give me
[1:37:25] so if it's not a Grace that's never been
[1:37:28] the only other alternative is it's a
[1:37:31] restoration of a Grace that had already
[1:37:34] been but a church went down Through the
