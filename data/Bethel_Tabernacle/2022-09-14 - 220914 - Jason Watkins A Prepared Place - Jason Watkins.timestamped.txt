[0:39] Your Grace under the care of the wings
[0:43] of Jehovah Eagle Lord for some number of
[0:46] days I've saw myself Lord with no change
[0:49] from the Holy Spirit just aiming
[0:52] directly at this thought tonight today
[0:54] Lord I watch the hours pass by knowing
[0:57] that hour by hour minute by minute I
[0:59] would draw closer to the moment when I
[1:02] walked out read this text and begin to
[1:04] bring this word to these people now
[1:06] father I pray Lord we are your children
[1:10] we're the family of God we need your
[1:13] word Lord so come now father I pray make
[1:16] this word a living reality to us tonight

[1:30] father we are your family we're your
[1:32] children you are obligated Lord to feed
[1:36] your family Lord you are obligated to be

[1:42] be that it is you who brought us into
[1:44] the world Lord these are everything that
[1:47] we do is For Your Glory it's to serve
[1:50] your purposes
[1:52] and so we're here tonight Lord to do
[1:55] exactly that now I commit myself
[1:58] surrendering in every way humanly that I
[2:01] can
[2:02] myself to your leadership in Jesus name
[2:05] amen God bless you can be seated
[2:20] brother Branham
[2:22] takes up this
[2:24] this scripture
[2:26] in the message things that are to be
[2:28] very late in his ministry in fact is
[2:32] he's at this point when he preaches this
[2:34] sermon he is less than 30 days
[2:39] from going to his reward and leaving the
[2:43] Realms that we live in presently now he
[2:45] didn't die no Christian ever did die and
[2:48] but we do realize that he moved on to uh
[2:51] to that next realm and you know we We
[2:55] Know by the preaching and teaching of
[2:57] the word of God that
[2:59] if you go by the way of the Grave on
[3:02] Resurrection mourning The Trumpet Of God
[3:04] shall sound and the dead in Christ shall
[3:07] rise first amen and brother Branham said
[3:10] if that's the situation for you then you
[3:13] will you your theophany will come and
[3:16] pick up your body that was stored and
[3:20] buried I remember you know offering the
[3:23] words of comfort to my family and to my
[3:27] mother and to you as a church at the at
[3:30] the loss of brother Eddie when I stood
[3:32] there and I said now you just remember
[3:34] all we're doing is storing his body this
[3:37] isn't brother Eddie in this casket we're
[3:40] just storing his Temple we're going to
[3:42] store it out here in a graveyard and and
[3:44] on that morning he'll come and he'll
[3:47] pick it back up and it'll be glorified
[3:49] and changed and brother Branham said if
[3:51] you die then you bring that theophany to
[3:54] pick up this body if you are alive and
[3:57] remain at the trumpet of when the Trump
[3:59] Trumpet Of God sounds then you bring
[4:02] this living body to the theophany and
[4:04] you are changed in a moment then we
[4:06] which are alive and remain shall be
[4:09] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[4:13] an eye what a moment oh what a moment
[4:17] I'm waiting for that moment My Moment by
[4:20] moment day by day we pass time and we
[4:23] we're here to serve the Lord and since
[4:27] since my life and future are bright and
[4:30] your life and your future are bright the
[4:33] life that lays ahead of us friends then
[4:35] why would we uh look at this life in a
[4:40] self-gratifying way why would we not
[4:42] rather just give ourselves unreservedly
[4:45] to whatever his plan is for our life
[4:48] seeing as hell this life isn't my real
[4:51] life the one coming is my real life
[4:56] brother Branham is going to deal with
[4:58] that quite a bit here in things that are
[4:59] to be he preaches this as at the same
[5:02] time he's preaching on the Rapture and
[5:05] he he I think he preaches the Rapture
[5:07] first and then he comes with things that
[5:09] are to be here and he says here now
[5:12] Jesus here is speaking about he's gone
[5:15] ahead to prepare a place for us let not
[5:19] your hearts be troubled that is a
[5:23] weighty statement let not your hearts be
[5:25] be troubled I I want to say to you
[5:27] tonight as I just began to feel the
[5:30] surge of the anointing coming upon me I
[5:33] just believe God has something special
[5:35] for you to realize tonight about this
[5:38] life and I don't know what the devil
[5:40] might have uh badgered you with over the
[5:42] last week or over today or whatever you
[5:46] might be going through but I'm here to
[5:47] tell you and remind you he ain't nobody
[5:51] he don't make any decisions about your
[5:53] life or my life my life my times are in
[5:56] his hands
[5:57] if the enemy is it really he's just the
[6:00] greatest puppet ever known because
[6:02] everything he does concerning me he has
[6:05] to get permission well if my father
[6:07] gives him permission then praise the
[6:09] Lord
[6:11] see
[6:12] so I the the bottom line is he can't
[6:16] stop me
[6:19] you're just Revel in that for a moment
[6:22] and say he can't stop me I'm already
[6:25] ordained before the foundation of the
[6:27] world and he's never been able to stop
[6:29] the ordained works of almighty God
[6:33] he tries to interfere but all he ends up
[6:36] doing is uh he ends up making the way
[6:40] for God to do it even easier
[6:43] he is you know you'd think um uh someone
[6:46] frustrated
[6:48] so severely over so many centuries so
[6:52] many times would give up
[6:54] [Laughter]
[6:56] you know I I I I I think that he he
[6:59] tries to get you to give up because he's
[7:01] so angry that he can he would like to
[7:05] he knows if he gives up he's doomed and
[7:07] he's doomed anyway but you know he he
[7:11] he's he's very faithful at trying to
[7:13] discourage us you know it's it's like a
[7:15] person you I've seen people you know and
[7:17] come across people who were who were
[7:20] very angry you know sometimes at at
[7:23] things that they see other believers do
[7:26] you know that might be a little carnal
[7:28] yeah okay granted but this person just
[7:31] get abnormally angry and indignant over
[7:34] the whole thing and you know I I sadly I
[7:38] have occasionally found and more often
[7:41] true than it's not that when I see that
[7:43] level of reaction I I end up finding out
[7:47] a little while down the road that really
[7:49] the reason that person was so angry is
[7:51] they actually want to do that
[7:53] but they're afraid to do it they don't
[7:55] want to miss the Rapture and don't want
[7:56] to go to hell and don't and so they're
[7:58] afraid and and they live under Perpetual
[8:00] anger because they want to be wild and
[8:03] they want to be carnal but they live
[8:05] under a fear that they can't be and it
[8:07] comes out in the in their judgmental
[8:08] ways of other people
[8:12] amen that's not my sermon tonight
[8:14] breathe Karma it's okay you'll be all
[8:17] right it's not my sermon
[8:19] but you know I think that's the way the
[8:22] devil is that he he knows he he can't
[8:24] win and so if he can't win he doesn't
[8:27] want you to win either
[8:29] but he I found out by the Bible he's
[8:32] already too late and I love telling him
[8:34] that I love telling him that Satan
[8:37] you're actually you're already too late
[8:39] I mean as of right now already it's
[8:42] already too late you already can't stop
[8:44] it
[8:45] see so so so God is in control of it all
[8:50] brother Branham is going to illustrate
[8:52] that here
[8:53] he says he says let not your hearts be
[8:55] troubled because the real promise when
[8:58] you realize that if he's gone to prepare
[9:01] something for you
[9:03] that where he's going you're going to
[9:05] end up going the same place then then
[9:09] why would you let your heart be troubled
[9:12] over anything
[9:13] I mean if you think about it just think
[9:15] it through for a minute if he's already
[9:17] got another world waiting for me and
[9:19] that's eternal life and it's Eternal joy
[9:22] and it's Eternal Bliss and I don't ever
[9:23] have to come back here and do this again
[9:27] say well you know you might have another
[9:29] 20 30 years of of hardship I can do 20
[9:32] years
[9:33] I can do I can do the time I can do 30
[9:37] years I'm going to keep fighting for
[9:38] Jesus anyway it doesn't matter I'm never
[9:41] going to stop
[9:43] you know it doesn't matter how many I
[9:45] might even stumble and I might even trip
[9:47] myself I'm gonna get back up I'm never
[9:50] walking away I'm never stopping
[9:55] you know if if somebody wants me
[9:57] destroyed the Lord's gonna have to do it
[10:00] because I'm not going to stop
[10:02] I'm gonna go forward and when I'm done
[10:05] I'm gonna go forward some more
[10:07] and I'll go and tell the trumpet sounds
[10:09] until death takes me and then it's not
[10:11] really death anyhow or until the trumpet
[10:13] sounds and then I'll be with you and
[10:15] we'll be alive and remain and I believe
[10:17] that that's the way it'll be because I
[10:18] believe the Rapture of the of God's
[10:21] consummation of his Rapture of his
[10:23] Gentile family is coming in my lifetime
[10:26] Hallelujah
[10:29] so he says let not your heart be
[10:31] troubled I've gone ahead to prepare a
[10:33] place let not your heart be troubled now
[10:35] he was talking to the Jews they had no
[10:37] trouble believing God but it was when
[10:39] God became flesh that's where they had a
[10:42] hard time and listen
[10:44] we realized that you know the world
[10:48] sometimes has a hard time seeing God in
[10:51] you and Christ in you but that's really
[10:54] immaterial
[10:56] that what they think of you is not going
[10:58] to stop you I'm here tonight to try to
[11:01] make you not think that about you
[11:03] let not your heart be troubled because
[11:05] God's got this and he's got you and he's
[11:08] got a plan and you're it
[11:11] see and so a lot of times we have
[11:14] trouble seeing don't we
[11:16] come on don't we
[11:18] we find right with our frailties and our
[11:20] mistakes and our and we say my what is
[11:23] wrong with me how many how many have
[11:25] said that my goodness what's wrong with
[11:27] me why Lord help me Lord forgive me oh I
[11:29] don't have a clue why in the world would
[11:31] I do that and and and and I yeah and
[11:34] then the devil tries to come and say see
[11:36] where's your experience where's the Holy
[11:38] Ghost well you know I I might can't
[11:41] answer that kind of a charge but here's
[11:43] what I can say I'm a Believer
[11:47] and I know I fail but I'm a Believer and
[11:52] I know I come up short but I'm a
[11:54] Believer
[11:55] and I love God and I know I love God and
[11:57] I love his word and I love his lifestyle
[12:01] that's why I'm so upset that I didn't
[12:03] live it
[12:04] if I didn't love it why would I be upset
[12:08] so it's not just you know putting the
[12:12] devil in his place you need to put you
[12:13] in your place
[12:16] and start believing what God said about
[12:18] you and start believing the fact that
[12:21] you're a Believer and that you couldn't
[12:23] be unless he made you one
[12:25] that's Bible the human mind the Fallen
[12:28] mind is enmity against God's against God
[12:30] it could never agree with every way it
[12:32] could never say Amen to all of God's
[12:34] word
[12:37] and so the fact that you can means
[12:39] you're already an Impossible Creature
[12:43] you already are living in a plane that
[12:45] you couldn't get yourself to
[12:48] he says so he says some
[12:51] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[12:53] to himself
[12:56] now as you have believed in God believe
[12:57] also in me for in my father's house for
[12:59] many mansions and I go to prepare a
[13:01] place Jesus life was fixing to end here
[13:03] on Earth
[13:05] he had shown the people and proved to
[13:06] them that he was Jehovah manifest in the
[13:08] flesh
[13:09] now he said now watch this
[13:12] now he said when you see my life ending
[13:15] it's ending for a purpose
[13:17] and that's big
[13:18] because as long as you can see that your
[13:21] life has a Divine Purpose you won't let
[13:24] the devil bully you
[13:27] you'll realize that you're you're
[13:29] marching you get orders from a different
[13:31] headquarters
[13:33] amen and you're not subject to his to
[13:36] his moods
[13:38] I don't care if Satan woke up on the
[13:40] wrong side of the bed today that's
[13:42] nothing to do with me
[13:44] it's nothing to do with me I can't he
[13:46] goes about like a roaring lion I don't
[13:48] care
[13:50] nothing to do with me I know this my
[13:53] Lord doesn't wake up on the wrong side
[13:54] of the bed every day he loves me every
[13:57] day he cares me every day he comes after
[13:59] me and if I Stray he comes after me
[14:02] anyhow
[14:06] oh my when you see my life ending it's
[14:09] ending for a purpose I'm going away to
[14:11] prepare a place for you
[14:14] see so that's that's that was a motive a
[14:17] major motive in the heart of God that he
[14:19] brother Branham said he wanted to share
[14:21] his eternal life
[14:24] my goodness
[14:28] what a statement
[14:30] God wanted to share his eternal life
[14:33] with you and me
[14:36] and so he says Jesus therefore is
[14:39] telling his disciples
[14:41] now this is an important point and I
[14:43] really want you to absorb this this is
[14:46] probably
[14:48] the thing that's the closest to my heart
[14:49] that if I can get you to understand I
[14:52] know you're going to understand it but
[14:54] if I can get you to really own it and
[14:56] assimilate it
[14:57] and he says Jesus therefore is telling
[15:00] his disciples
[15:01] that this life is not ended in death
[15:07] now you just let that soak for a minute
[15:11] this life
[15:13] that you're living right now the one
[15:15] that you got in you
[15:16] that's animating your body if your life
[15:18] left your body your body would collapse
[15:21] and the real you would be standing
[15:23] beside it
[15:24] see you'd still be alive
[15:27] that life that's the life I'm talking
[15:29] about
[15:30] that that that life is not ended
[15:33] in death see
[15:36] so he makes reference he said if I if
[15:38] this was a funeral text he says you know
[15:41] death human death of the physical body
[15:45] now listen up teenagers this is really
[15:47] really informative for you
[15:50] because you're so young
[15:52] you don't naturally think about what
[15:54] he's about to say it took an older man
[15:57] say this it's taking an older man
[15:59] tonight to say to you teenagers listen
[16:00] up because that's what naturally
[16:02] occurred to you say how do you know
[16:04] because I used to be a teenager and it
[16:05] never naturally occurred to me but watch
[16:07] what he says
[16:09] he says remember
[16:11] we death sets right before us
[16:15] and we don't know whether there may be
[16:17] some in this building tonight will not
[16:19] go out of here alive
[16:23] you don't even know that's how uncertain
[16:25] life is
[16:27] you might not go out of here tonight
[16:28] alive
[16:32] he says um
[16:38] in this you might not go out of here
[16:40] alive in this physical life
[16:43] that's how uncertain it is
[16:47] five minutes from now all right here is
[16:51] an absolute bona fide fact it doesn't
[16:55] mean it's going to happen but at 100
[16:58] percent could happen
[17:01] say well it's unlikely but it could
[17:04] all right five minutes from now
[17:08] I could start timing it five minutes
[17:10] from now it could be
[17:13] that a young
[17:15] healthy young people in this building
[17:18] can be a corpse in five minutes from now
[17:23] that is true
[17:25] and again it could be in five minutes
[17:28] from now with everyone be in glory
[17:39] I might start jumping them down on that
[17:40] one
[17:42] we just don't know that's in the hands
[17:45] of God Jesus said he didn't know himself
[17:47] when that time would be that was in the
[17:49] hands of the father only so now but he
[17:52] was telling them that after death there
[17:57] is life
[17:58] because I go and prepare a place that is
[18:02] to receive them shows that there he was
[18:06] speaking to them that there was a life
[18:09] after this life ended what a consolation
[18:14] that ought to give to all of us to know
[18:18] that after this life is over there is a
[18:21] life that we go into
[18:23] oh here's a good one I love this one as
[18:26] you get older that becomes more of a
[18:29] reality to you and you begin as you
[18:32] begin to see the days of your life
[18:34] drawing close then it began you begin to
[18:36] pack up closer getting ready for that
[18:38] great event he's calling your physical
[18:41] departure a great event it took a
[18:44] prophet to talk like that you know wait
[18:46] a minute somebody's gonna die it's a
[18:48] great event yes it's a great event well
[18:50] how can you say that because they they
[18:51] won't really be dead
[18:53] it means that this life the one you have
[18:56] right now he said watch this he says he
[18:58] says he says because I go to prepare a
[19:00] place so after this life he won a
[19:03] consolation that ought to give to all of
[19:05] us to know that after this life is over
[19:07] there is a life that we go into as you
[19:09] get older that becomes more of a reality
[19:11] to you as you begin to see the days of
[19:13] your life drawing close and it begins
[19:14] you begin to pack up getting ready for
[19:16] that great that great event it's a it's
[19:19] a it's a continuing of this same life in
[19:26] another world
[19:29] Glory Hallelujah it's a continuation say
[19:34] what is death it's a continuation of
[19:38] life in another world another place
[19:42] that's why I'm a Christian that's why
[19:44] I'm a Believer that's why I love the
[19:46] Lord
[19:52] so now he's going to
[19:55] he's going to turn a corner he's almost
[19:57] almost gonna
[19:59] when you listen to it on tape it's
[20:00] almost like brother Branham has set up
[20:02] set him up you know he's got everybody
[20:04] you know rejoicing and now he's really
[20:07] going to make some Baptists mad
[20:10] because he's going to talk about the
[20:12] importance
[20:13] of having your life
[20:16] ready
[20:20] his very next line is it's a continuing
[20:23] of the same life and into the world
[20:25] another place now watch he goes he's
[20:27] going to go straight from there into the
[20:29] very next paragraph
[20:30] your birth here was pre-planned
[20:35] I guess you believe that
[20:38] every one of you knows that our birth
[20:40] was pre-planned did you know
[20:42] that your being here was never
[20:44] originated just a myth or a thought
[20:46] everything was all planned by God before
[20:49] the foundation of the world that you
[20:51] would be here the infinite God knowed
[20:53] and to be infinite he had to know every
[20:55] flea that ever would be in the earth and
[20:56] how many times it would bat its eye
[20:58] that's infidency our little Minds
[21:01] our little Minds cannot fathom what
[21:04] infinite means the infinite God he note
[21:07] all things therefore there's nothing out
[21:09] of cater can I say to you tonight
[21:11] friends and and feel free to jump up and
[21:14] run around the building and run up down
[21:15] the street screaming I don't care what
[21:17] kind of sorrow sadness sickness whatever
[21:20] whatever's your trial whatever's your
[21:22] Affliction whatever whatever is going on
[21:24] to you nothing's out of cater
[21:28] I don't care where your physical health
[21:31] is where your mental health is Where
[21:32] Your Children Are where your finances
[21:34] are where your where your marriage is
[21:36] nothing's out of cater
[21:38] so there's a lot of brother Jason I
[21:41] could tell you a story I'm not saying
[21:43] you don't have issues and problems I'm
[21:46] saying there's somebody still in control
[21:49] nothing's out of cater there's an
[21:52] all-powerful hand got his hand on it you
[21:55] say but it's really bad it's in his hand
[21:58] don't worry little bride it's the
[22:01] father's good pleasure to give you the
[22:03] kingdom oh you're gonna get the kingdom
[22:06] it might not be in the next five minutes
[22:08] but it's gonna be
[22:12] if we know the word of God we know where
[22:15] we're living we know the hour that we're
[22:17] living in we know what lays ahead we see
[22:20] what we've passed and the Book of God is
[22:22] the revelation of Jesus Christ his Works
[22:24] Through the Ages
[22:26] that was up to the Book of Revelation
[22:28] and then his promises that is to come so
[22:31] all of his promises are true God cannot
[22:33] speak any word without it being
[22:35] confirmed every word that he says has to
[22:38] come to pass before the foundation of
[22:41] the world
[22:43] so
[22:45] I want you to take some consolation
[22:48] in this fact
[22:50] in this fact that was exposed by a
[22:56] prophet
[22:58] everything in your life
[23:00] is taken care of
[23:04] and that doesn't that that's that steps
[23:07] around trials it steps around hardships
[23:11] it steps around sickness it steps around
[23:13] grief it steps around persecution it
[23:16] steps around doesn't matter what it is
[23:18] everything is prepared Jesus said I go
[23:21] to prepare a place he God God is in the
[23:25] preparing business
[23:27] the Bible tells us in Matthew 3 for this
[23:31] is he that was spoken of by the prophet
[23:33] Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in
[23:35] the wilderness prepare you the way of
[23:37] the Lord make his path straight so God
[23:39] sends a prophet to prepare his arrival
[23:43] see Luke 1 76 and thou child shall be
[23:47] called the prophet of the highest for
[23:49] Thou shalt go before the face of the
[23:51] Lord to prepare his ways so John
[23:54] prepared the way but really it was the
[23:57] father who prepared the way for Jesus
[23:59] ministry
[24:02] and so you know parents prepare for
[24:06] children
[24:08] Ministry pastors prepare I prepare
[24:11] sermons to preach
[24:13] I prepare myself to be a spiritual man
[24:18] I prepare myself to study I prepare to
[24:22] pray you say you prepare to pray you
[24:25] know you know how I prepare to pray I
[24:28] get in the spirit
[24:30] brother Branham says before you do
[24:33] anything get in the spirit
[24:35] before even before you pray say well I I
[24:40] just I start praying and I and and I
[24:42] just pray my way into the Spirit Well
[24:44] you you're supposed to get into the
[24:46] spirit before you pray
[24:48] say what's a good way to do it sing a
[24:50] song the Bible says have a song on your
[24:52] lips and a Psalm in your heart
[24:54] and and and and you know start rejoicing
[24:57] in the Lord and start thanking God I'm
[25:00] here to tell you if you started it at at
[25:02] when the chickens go get up and you
[25:05] thanked him all the way till dark thirty
[25:07] you couldn't thank him enough if you did
[25:10] that every day for 25 years in a row
[25:13] and you spent the whole entire time of
[25:16] your life just thanking him you'd never
[25:18] thank him enough
[25:21] so so
[25:23] Paul talks about in second Timothy
[25:25] chapter 2.
[25:28] uh give me that Jeremiah second Timothy
[25:30] chapter two let's read it together we'll
[25:32] begin in verse 16. and I'll just read
[25:35] down through looks like maybe 20 verse
[25:37] 22 second Timothy chapter 2 verse 16.
[25:40] but here's some instructions shun
[25:42] profane and and vain babblings for they
[25:46] will increase unto more ungodliness and
[25:49] their word will eat as doth a canker of
[25:52] whom is hymenius and felitis who
[25:54] concerning the truth have aired saying
[25:56] that the resurrection has passed already
[25:57] and overthrow the faith of some
[25:59] nevertheless
[26:00] the foundation of God's standeth Shore
[26:03] those guys ran their race blew things up
[26:07] injured people's lives but the word of
[26:10] God still Stood Still Still stood sure
[26:12] see
[26:13] and look what it says nevertheless the
[26:15] foundation of God standeth sure having
[26:18] this seal the Lord knoweth them that are
[26:22] his and let everyone that nameth the
[26:24] name of Christ depart from iniquity
[26:27] but in a great house there are not only
[26:29] vessels of gold and silver which are
[26:30] good good ones but also wooden of Earth
[26:33] and some to honor and some to dishonor
[26:35] if a man therefore Purge himself from
[26:38] these now who's going to purge him
[26:41] he's going to purge himself if a man
[26:43] therefore Purge himself from these he
[26:46] shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified
[26:49] and meet for the Master's use and
[26:51] preparedness stay right there on that
[26:53] verse and prepare to every good work
[26:56] I mean this ain't rocket science
[27:00] you don't need Gabriel to come down
[27:02] tonight you don't need to have a
[27:04] spiritual dream like Daniel
[27:06] you don't even you don't even need me up
[27:08] here waving and turning red and
[27:10] screaming at you here's a perfect
[27:12] instead of instructions a man therefore
[27:15] if a man Purge himself from these he
[27:17] shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified
[27:19] in meat from the master's use and
[27:21] prepare to every good work from Purge
[27:23] myself from what things from unbelievers
[27:26] people like hymenius and felitas people
[27:28] who who who go in and and Lead whole
[27:31] households into lasciviousness
[27:34] you know and and and evil concupiscence
[27:37] and evil desires and all of these
[27:39] different things I mean this is not
[27:41] rocket science this is overcoming 101.
[27:46] you purge yourself of these things how
[27:48] with prayer with praise with church with
[27:51] the word amen you purge yourself of
[27:55] these things Jesus said I go to prepare
[27:58] a place
[28:00] see so he so the principle now is for
[28:03] you because where is he going
[28:06] and he says the way you know and they
[28:08] said to him later what do you we don't
[28:10] know what do you mean with the way we
[28:12] know how do we know
[28:13] and the Jews even questioned him before
[28:16] that he was he was you know saying
[28:18] strange stuff and and then almost and
[28:21] almost a very very you know uh you know
[28:24] in an abstract way and you know I'm
[28:26] going to go away and a little while you
[28:28] won't see me the world won't see me but
[28:30] you'll see me and and the Jews are like
[28:32] wait wait what where does he where is he
[28:34] going that we can't come what's he
[28:36] talking about
[28:37] see and now he's coming here I go to
[28:40] prepare a place that where I am you can
[28:42] be also so I'm I'm here to tell you
[28:44] that's why brother Branham said it's a
[28:47] it's a prepared place for prepared
[28:49] people
[28:51] say I want to go to a place he prepared
[28:54] he wants you to be prepared he wants you
[28:56] to be the place he's talking about
[29:01] because he's going to go and live inside
[29:04] his church
[29:06] see
[29:08] so he says verse 22 flee also youthful
[29:11] us but follow righteousness Faith
[29:13] charity peace and them that call on the
[29:16] Lord out of a pure heart that's easy
[29:18] that's not hard that's not complicated
[29:21] that's not mysterious
[29:23] flee youthful lust follow righteousness
[29:25] Faith charity peace with them that call
[29:28] on the Lord out of a pure heart
[29:31] brother Branham you know he deals with
[29:34] that I don't want to get sidetracked and
[29:35] I'll get into my Sunday material I don't
[29:37] want to do that desperately bad tonight
[29:39] so
[29:40] so if we okay you can take that down
[29:43] Jeremiah I don't I don't want to just
[29:45] keep putting scriptures up it slows me
[29:46] down I'm just going to refer to these
[29:49] you know even uh
[29:51] even in Revelation 8 6 and this is kind
[29:55] of edging into Sunday's material and the
[29:58] Seven Angels which had the seven
[30:00] trumpets prepared themselves to sound
[30:04] so you see this whole I mean even the
[30:08] the way of the Antichrist in Revelation
[30:10] 16 12 and the six Angel poured out his
[30:12] vial upon the great river Euphrates and
[30:14] the waters thereof was dried up that the
[30:16] way of the kings of the East might be
[30:18] prepared
[30:19] so God's preparing both sides he's
[30:22] preparing his family and the devil's
[30:24] family he's preparing say World politics
[30:27] God's preparing that
[30:29] world events world wars famine disease
[30:32] nature God's prepared it is what it is
[30:35] because he prepared it to be
[30:38] Hallelujah nothing is out of cater I
[30:42] know The Madness of the world I know
[30:44] it's cast on the streets I know it's
[30:46] Insanity I know the the seventh seal and
[30:49] the seventh trumpet and the seventh vial
[30:51] in the seventh plague and brother
[30:52] Branham says they're all now ready to
[30:55] unfold on the world
[30:58] I'm so glad a bride is taking a Third
[31:01] Exodus
[31:03] I don't listen here's the easy part
[31:06] Getting Gone
[31:07] getting out
[31:09] that's the easy part the only way out is
[31:12] up
[31:13] now I can't get me up so he's gonna have
[31:15] to pull me up
[31:17] my job is to be prepared
[31:21] Hallelujah
[31:24] so so Jesus prepared a place
[31:28] for your life to continue forever that's
[31:31] rejoicing grounds so he so back to our
[31:34] text let not your heart be troubled
[31:36] see now that you know all of this let
[31:39] not your heart be troubled you believe
[31:41] in God believe in me in my father's
[31:44] house are many mansions
[31:46] many bodies
[31:48] there's a there's a word body already
[31:51] waiting on me say I hope I go to a word
[31:55] body it's already there
[31:57] [Music]
[31:58] if the Earthly Tabernacle that we live
[32:01] in be dissolved we have one already
[32:03] waiting in the heavens I've already got
[32:07] an identified body it's a word body
[32:10] Hallelujah that's why they say that's
[32:13] why brother Brandon would say you
[32:15] believe this message it's become a
[32:16] revealed Revelation to you you've heard
[32:18] from your theophany
[32:22] see you know you might not realize that
[32:24] friends but every day that you live
[32:26] you're getting closer and closer to a
[32:28] new world you're getting closer and
[32:29] closer and brother Brandon just starts
[32:31] talking about that we'll speed up
[32:32] they'll slow down oh my
[32:35] you're making more progress than you
[32:37] know you are
[32:39] and that's that's can be frustrating at
[32:41] times and we see that we know that
[32:44] brother Brown talks about the Harvest
[32:45] going to it's going ripe and it's laying
[32:48] in the August we've been dealing a lot
[32:49] about that the August presence laying in
[32:51] the presence of the Sun
[32:53] and this thought is somewhat of a
[32:55] continuation of that
[32:58] and brother Madam says the the level of
[33:01] growth
[33:03] and maturity
[33:05] gets real slow now that's in in nature
[33:07] go plant a wheat field and once the
[33:10] shuck has pulled back and the Green Seed
[33:12] is out in the then the the presence of
[33:14] the sun begins to turn it gold and
[33:15] yellow
[33:16] see and and it and it gets hardened and
[33:21] I who was I
[33:22] just hearing recently preach well I
[33:25] don't know if it was
[33:26] for the mat or brother Matt I don't
[33:28] remember now I was listening to someone
[33:30] and they were talking I didn't know this
[33:32] oh no it was uh I think it was Brother
[33:33] David Samuel on our morning thing I
[33:35] think well Joe you might remember this
[33:37] where the the farmer the wheat farmer
[33:40] that you know how he knows that grain is
[33:44] completely ripe he'll go out there when
[33:47] he he thinks it's getting close and
[33:49] he'll take it and he'll pinch it and
[33:51] he'll take his fingernails his two
[33:53] thumbnails and he'll dig into it and
[33:56] then he'll look at it and he'll look at
[33:58] the little dents the indentions that his
[34:00] nails dug into it and he knows it's not
[34:02] ready
[34:03] because it's still got moisture in there
[34:05] it's still not fully ripe see you
[34:07] wouldn't want it yet and so he'll go
[34:09] away and let the August presence just
[34:11] hit it and hit it and hit it lay out
[34:12] there in the presence of the Sun and
[34:14] then he'll come back sometime later and
[34:16] he'll dig in he'll pull another and
[34:17] he'll dig his thumbnails in there you
[34:19] can really torque it and he'll look and
[34:21] all of a sudden wow I can't Den it
[34:23] anymore
[34:24] but now there's one more test he'll take
[34:26] it he'll put it between his teeth
[34:28] fight down on that thing and put some
[34:31] put some pounds per square inch on it
[34:33] and he'll look at it and if it's
[34:36] completely ripe and ready he there's no
[34:38] effect all that pressure there's no
[34:41] effect anymore I'm here to tell you
[34:43] something friends all of them are coming
[34:45] to a time it don't matter how much
[34:47] pressure it don't matter what happens in
[34:50] your life it has no effect on me it
[34:53] doesn't leave a mark anymore I'm
[34:55] overcoming it it doesn't matter what
[34:57] Satan does that's what we're headed to
[34:59] friends
[35:00] that's when the bride is raptured she's
[35:03] prepared to go in a rapture
[35:10] because look Jesus now if you'll notice
[35:12] and I I dealt with this
[35:15] I've dealt I've preached on this before
[35:17] some time ago and I dealt with a little
[35:19] bit of Virginia
[35:20] because Jesus didn't say
[35:23] I go to prepare a place that where I'll
[35:25] be
[35:26] you can be also he was going to go
[35:29] somewhere and you are going to be in
[35:30] that same place
[35:32] but what he said was that where I am
[35:35] where I am right now not where I'm going
[35:38] not what I'll be but that where I am I
[35:42] have gone to prepare a place for you
[35:43] that where I am right now say where
[35:46] where was he right then he was full of
[35:49] the Holy Ghost
[35:50] he was full of Faith full of Power full
[35:53] of love full of grace he was ready for
[35:56] Calvary he was ready to go he was ready
[35:59] for the next event nothing was going to
[36:01] stop him why because he said I I I'm
[36:04] trying to give you this principle
[36:06] because I'm going to need you to get
[36:08] just like me and I'm going away and what
[36:11] am I going to do I'm going to bring a
[36:13] holy ghost back and I'm going to come
[36:15] inside of you and then you're gonna be
[36:17] an extension of me and I'm the beginning
[36:20] of the creation of God I'm a prototype
[36:23] I'm a brand new kind of human being and
[36:25] there's going to be a whole
[36:27] from a people just like me who believe
[36:32] every word of God who trust in
[36:34] everything how many are here and I say
[36:36] I'm one of them I trust in the Lord I'm
[36:39] a Believer in all of his word
[36:42] that you have arrived at when he said
[36:45] where I am
[36:48] now just as he was ready you're getting
[36:51] ready
[36:52] see
[36:54] so the place he is going to
[36:58] is into the form of the Holy Spirit
[37:02] but so so where he is
[37:05] a place of total
[37:07] compliance
[37:09] to the heavenly father
[37:11] and there's that's what the Holy Ghost
[37:15] is given for
[37:17] to do in you what it did in him
[37:21] he's in a place of total compliance to
[37:25] the father
[37:26] see
[37:27] and says that we can be that where I am
[37:31] you may be also I I'm not going to uh
[37:35] have well put it up for me Jeremiah John
[37:38] chapter 7. here's some of that mercurial
[37:41] talk that they couldn't understand Jesus
[37:43] Lives he's just blowing their minds John
[37:45] 7 37 and to 39.
[37:49] in the last day
[37:52] that great day of the feast
[37:55] Jesus stood in Christ saying if any man
[37:58] thirst let him come unto me and drink
[38:01] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[38:05] has said out of his belly shall flow
[38:08] rivers of Living Water but this spaky of
[38:11] the Holy Spirit which they that believe
[38:14] on him should receive for the Holy Ghost
[38:16] was not yet given because that Jesus was
[38:18] not yet glorified and so the message
[38:21] then
[38:22] in in everything and all of the burden
[38:25] that's on my heart tonight the message
[38:28] and the whole thought is is really
[38:31] summed up to this that if you desire
[38:34] to go where he was going
[38:37] and become what he became
[38:40] then you have to go the way he went by
[38:43] the same baptism of the Holy Ghost
[38:47] amen
[38:49] so that's why you can't join the family
[38:52] of God that's why you can't just shake
[38:54] the preacher's hand and brother Adam
[38:56] said put your name on a book and believe
[38:58] just in a historical and have have just
[39:01] uh uh a mental concept
[39:05] because Jesus was saying I'm going away
[39:08] to prepare and and if I go away I'll
[39:11] come again and receive you unto myself
[39:14] that where I am there you may be also so
[39:16] if you desire to go where he was going
[39:19] how many want to do that
[39:23] then you then you have to become what he
[39:25] became
[39:27] and you have to go the way he went to
[39:30] become what he became to go where he was
[39:32] going
[39:35] what did I just say but it has to be by
[39:39] the same baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[39:42] same thinking the same mind of Christ
[39:43] the same mind that says Amen to every
[39:47] word the same willingness listen listen
[39:49] listen the same willingness
[39:51] that he had
[39:53] to lay your life down
[39:57] I think I proved to you at the beginning
[39:59] at the beginning of the sermon I don't
[40:01] know why in the world you keep chasing
[40:02] trying to make this life a happy one
[40:04] this one don't even count
[40:07] this one don't even show up on the on
[40:09] this on the graph
[40:11] I mean this one wouldn't move the needle
[40:13] on the Richter scale at all
[40:15] this life is only about the next one
[40:18] this is only a Proving Grounds a
[40:20] training grounds a Proving Grounds a
[40:22] training field I've said that to you so
[40:24] many times and this is what brother
[40:25] Branham is saying your life was
[40:27] pre-planned by God
[40:30] see
[40:32] and so it has to be the same willingness
[40:34] to lay your life down and take up your
[40:37] cross
[40:38] because the conditions John 12 24
[40:41] Jeremiah I'm giving you a workout
[40:43] tonight
[40:44] John 12 24 the same conditions for the
[40:47] reward of being where he is
[40:50] see
[40:51] it's found in this 24th verse
[40:54] verily verily truly truly I say unto you
[40:58] and this applied to him and it applies
[41:00] to you except a corn of wheat Fallen to
[41:03] the ground and die and abideth alone but
[41:07] if it died bringeth forth much fruit
[41:08] listen let me just let me read it to you
[41:11] and bring it home
[41:14] with all truth and sincerity
[41:18] remember you remember when brother
[41:20] Abraham Meyer was here and he he's
[41:22] reading John 14 and Jesus is saying
[41:27] that in my father's house are many
[41:29] mansions he's trying he's getting ready
[41:31] to go he's getting ready to leave them
[41:33] and he's trying to leave them with some
[41:34] words of comfort
[41:36] and my I go away to prepare and my don't
[41:39] worry
[41:40] I'll come again
[41:41] in my father's house are many mansions
[41:44] and your life here is only a
[41:46] representation of one that's already
[41:47] there anyway
[41:49] see
[41:51] and and and and and and I'm gonna go and
[41:54] I'm gonna prepare this way for you
[41:57] but but understand this that even me
[41:59] even I and and brother Abraham Point
[42:02] pointed out he says look how sincere the
[42:05] Lord Jesus was
[42:07] look how honest
[42:10] I mean hey teenage girls let me tell you
[42:14] something
[42:15] unconverted boys are liars
[42:18] last day
[42:19] and cheaters
[42:21] and they'll do you wrong
[42:23] Brothers unconverted girls are liars and
[42:27] cheaters and will do you wrong I have
[42:29] nothing to do with them
[42:31] say well I love her good pray for her
[42:33] that God will give her the Holy Ghost
[42:34] then she might be ready for you
[42:39] so so brother Abraham is saying look at
[42:42] his sincerity and he's saying to the
[42:44] people if it were not so I would have
[42:46] told you listen if this was to if I was
[42:49] a fake I'd just tell you
[42:51] if none of this was true and in my
[42:53] father's house are many mansions but if
[42:55] it wasn't true I wouldn't mislead you I
[42:58] would just admit it
[42:59] and I would say listen I'm sorry
[43:02] um I've got a I've got a this power that
[43:05] I can do great Miracles and everything
[43:06] but I really can't help you I know
[43:08] you're all following me and I fed you
[43:10] one time five thousand of you and I did
[43:12] it again you saw me walk on water but
[43:14] the bottom line is there's really
[43:16] nothing in it for you and I'm just going
[43:17] to be honest
[43:19] that's that was his level of integrity
[43:22] that if it were not so I would tell you
[43:27] but it is so
[43:29] it is true you believe in God believe in
[43:32] me
[43:34] in my father's house are many mansions
[43:37] I I've seen those mansions and that's
[43:39] how I know who you are I already know
[43:42] you have an identity waiting on you
[43:45] [Applause]
[43:48] see
[43:50] verily verily I've seen you accept a
[43:52] corn of wheat Fallen to the ground and
[43:54] died abideth alone so if you if you
[43:58] chase this world
[44:01] you end up with nothing
[44:04] no matter listen
[44:06] death
[44:08] finishes
[44:10] everything you've accomplished
[44:14] talk about an exercise in futility
[44:19] if you if you become the king of the
[44:21] world the richest person in the world
[44:23] and have everything times a thousand
[44:26] more money and more Fame and more
[44:28] popularity and you've got more likes and
[44:31] more subscribers and and it doesn't
[44:34] matter you you get elected to the
[44:35] highest office in the land I'm sorry uh
[44:39] death is the end of the line
[44:41] and then you die alone
[44:44] and you take none of those friends none
[44:46] of that money none of those possessions
[44:48] Sinners die alone
[44:51] they die
[44:52] very much alone
[44:56] and so Jesus is going to give the rip
[44:58] get give the remedy to not die alone
[45:03] see
[45:05] truly truly I say unto you except a corn
[45:07] of wheat Fallen to the ground and die at
[45:09] abideth alone
[45:11] but if it die
[45:13] spiritually speaking now it bringeth
[45:16] forth much fruit
[45:18] see
[45:19] you know Hudson Taylor
[45:21] when he came to the very next chapter
[45:25] hero of mine I remember reading his life
[45:27] story one of reading his life stories
[45:29] what made me want to be a missionary and
[45:32] travel the world even more than reading
[45:34] about David Livingston it was Hudson
[45:35] Taylor
[45:36] missionary to the Chinese
[45:39] to China
[45:40] and he starts talking about Saint John
[45:42] 15 the very next passage that Jesus is
[45:45] going to go to give me Saint John 15.
[45:48] Jeremiah let's read let's look at that
[45:51] verse 1 from Saint John chapter 15 I am
[45:54] the True Vine and my father is the
[45:56] husbandman
[45:57] go on
[45:59] every branch in me that beareth not
[46:01] fruit he taketh away
[46:04] and we're going to stop right here every
[46:05] branch in me that beareth not fruit he
[46:09] taketh away and every branch that
[46:12] beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may
[46:15] bring forth more fruit
[46:18] now first first let me give you the the
[46:21] main stay or the main sense of this
[46:25] verse this primarily is talking about
[46:28] the church ages brother Branham is clear
[46:29] on that you go all the way back to the
[46:31] 1950s all the way through the end of his
[46:32] ministry and whenever he goes to Saint
[46:34] John 15 2 he's always talking about the
[46:38] church ages that they a messenger caught
[46:40] it and ran with it and people gathered
[46:42] it then the messenger died went off the
[46:45] scene God took his bride home and then
[46:47] they built a denomination around it and
[46:49] God he immediately hewed it off and went
[46:52] on to the next stage and dropped another
[46:54] star out of his right hand and another
[46:56] messenger hit the earth and caught
[46:58] another mystery and ran with it again
[46:59] and this cycle went all the way through
[47:01] seven Church ages because it becomes
[47:04] problematic you have to be very careful
[47:06] when you apply it to your human life
[47:08] because and brother Branham even got
[47:10] challenged on that uh in in a message in
[47:13] trying to do God a service without it
[47:15] being his will very late in November the
[47:17] 27th 19th 65.
[47:20] because it's you have to if you're going
[47:23] to break it down into a human because
[47:24] and here was the man's question he was
[47:26] trying to trying to challenge brother
[47:27] Brown and he come to him he says so so
[47:30] that day I was preaching on that I said
[47:33] now you see when the church first
[47:35] started out it was Jesus said I was pre
[47:38] he says I was preaching John 15 I am the
[47:40] vineyard of the branches and every
[47:42] branch that don't bring forth fruit he
[47:45] will cut off
[47:48] and it'll be burned and someday
[47:50] just got on my neck real hard about that
[47:53] on that and said Gee I thought if he was
[47:56] actually once filled with the Holy Ghost
[47:57] and saved you said you couldn't get away
[47:59] from it
[48:00] so this man is like trying to front on
[48:02] on brother Brown and said wow
[48:04] so I what's all this about the Holy
[48:06] Ghost I thought you know once I've
[48:08] passed from Death to life you told me if
[48:10] I get the Holy Ghost that I'm I'm in and
[48:12] now you're telling me that if I if my
[48:15] life becomes unfruitful that that I'm
[48:18] going to be hearing often cast and sent
[48:20] to Hell after all
[48:22] I'm gonna go into a tribulation after
[48:24] all
[48:26] and you can see that that's what you
[48:28] would could almost think but brother Ram
[48:31] says the the main primary thing of that
[48:33] is Jesus is speaking of the age
[48:35] the church ages and that's all through
[48:37] the message uh quote of quote of the
[48:39] quote
[48:40] but
[48:44] thinking about that he starts talking
[48:46] about and trying to bring it down to the
[48:48] human life and he says remember and he
[48:51] starts putting it into into the works
[48:53] into your life and he's really talking
[48:55] about like Jesus said except a corn of
[48:58] wheat died abideth alone but if it died
[49:01] then it'll bring forth much fruit and
[49:02] brother Branham talks about that and he
[49:04] goes into it I'm not going to take all
[49:06] these quotes at all because I'm out of
[49:07] time now but he says you know remember
[49:09] he's got you know you're his hands and
[49:12] you're his feet and you're his mouth and
[49:13] you're his lips and so so there is this
[49:16] this Dynamic that that it's Christ in
[49:20] you living out his life through you
[49:23] and and that's and that's exactly now
[49:25] we're talking about a fruitfulness okay
[49:28] and so now this guy is asking brother
[49:30] for animal I thought wow you said if I
[49:33] had the Holy Ghost and saved you said
[49:34] you couldn't get away from it brother
[49:35] and says that's right
[49:37] he says well what about that I said now
[49:40] you're talking on a different subject
[49:41] he's talking about fruit bearing there
[49:44] not the vine he's talking about fruit
[49:47] bearing and not the life
[49:51] see it's not about being born again and
[49:53] then unborn again
[49:55] it's about fruit bearing see and so so
[50:00] uh I mean because because you know and
[50:03] that's why when Hudson Taylor picks this
[50:04] up he says the methods of the Divine
[50:07] gardener
[50:09] are not necessarily severe not necess
[50:12] not of necessity
[50:14] not necessarily severe he cleanses by
[50:18] the application of the word and where
[50:20] the gentle voice of the spirit through
[50:22] the word is listened to
[50:24] severe and painful discipline may be
[50:27] unneeded
[50:29] I just want to say wow I know how I'm
[50:32] walking from now on
[50:34] man I got some insight here thank you
[50:37] brother Hudson thank you for pointing
[50:39] that out to me
[50:42] how much of restraint as well as of
[50:45] constraint we might be spared
[50:48] did the word of God dwell in us more
[50:50] richly
[50:51] and we're the leadings of the spirit
[50:53] more implicitly obeyed
[50:57] read that sentence again
[51:00] how much of restraint as well as of
[51:03] constraint we might be spared did the
[51:06] word of God dwell in us more richly and
[51:09] were the leadings of the spirit more
[51:11] implicitly obeyed
[51:15] and and I thought when I read that I
[51:17] thought I mean that rang in my heart and
[51:18] I thought wow I mean it's Hudson Taylor
[51:21] is a great man of God but that was under
[51:23] the man age I wonder brother Branham and
[51:25] I went and there and there's where I
[51:26] ended up here in this quote and trying
[51:28] to do God of service and brother random
[51:30] confirms what he said yeah it's not
[51:31] talking about life it's talking about
[51:32] fruitfulness
[51:34] and it's your fruitfulness Jesus said
[51:36] that where I am
[51:39] I'm going somewhere because I'm I am now
[51:42] and that's going to take me to the next
[51:45] event and if you want to get there
[51:46] you're going to have to come here
[51:49] say well how where are you except a corn
[51:51] of wheat diet abideth alone
[51:53] but if it died then it's going to bring
[51:55] forth much that's good for me that's
[51:57] good for you see it was good for Christ
[51:59] it's good for his church
[52:01] I mean this is exactly why I mean when
[52:04] brother Branham
[52:05] that bro I mean brother Branham connects
[52:08] Saint John 12 24 uh where where we read
[52:12] verily verily I say do you accept the
[52:14] court of wheat falling to the ground and
[52:16] died abideth alone but if it die it
[52:18] bringeth forth much fruit I mean brother
[52:21] Branham connected Saint John 12 24 to
[52:24] revelation 22 17. in the church age book
[52:28] he connected them together because 2217
[52:31] is the spirit and the bride say come
[52:34] where'd you get that voice where'd you
[52:36] get that Authority because when a corn
[52:38] of wheat I found out that if I just
[52:40] stayed to myself I died alone but if I
[52:43] was willing to die spiritually then I
[52:45] would be reborn and I'd become part of a
[52:48] kingdom and someday sit on a throne with
[52:50] the king and the spirit and the bride
[52:53] say come
[52:55] it's not about losing your Eternal your
[52:58] Eternal reward or being born again and
[53:00] then you're being unborn again it's
[53:01] about fruitfulness friends Jesus said I
[53:04] go to prepare a place
[53:08] and your life is prepared by God
[53:14] the holy spirit will come this is the
[53:17] promise he was trying to get to him the
[53:19] holy spirit will come our part
[53:22] is to have our hearts and Minds prepared
[53:26] for the word
[53:28] to speak through us
[53:30] that's what Christianity is really about
[53:33] that's what the Holy Ghost is given for
[53:37] so that we can have our hearts and Minds
[53:39] prepared
[53:41] for the word to speak to us for the Holy
[53:43] Ghost to move through us
[53:47] for the plan of God
[53:49] to live
[53:51] and conquer
[53:53] through us
[53:55] I want him to conquer through me
[53:59] I want him to live through me
[54:03] he prepared I am prepared God's prepared
[54:06] the word is prepared the world is
[54:08] prepared
[54:10] politics are prepared it's all prepared
[54:13] of God the Antichrist is prepared God
[54:16] has has those blowing the seven Trumpets
[54:19] They prepared themselves Paul talks
[54:21] about how that we are preparing
[54:23] ourselves
[54:25] and this is why Jesus finishes down we
[54:27] didn't read all the way down in our text
[54:29] in Saint John 14 but in the 27th verse
[54:32] Saint John 14 27.
[54:34] peace I leave with you
[54:38] Saint John 14 27 peace I leave with you
[54:41] my peace I give unto you
[54:45] not as the world giveth give I unto you
[54:49] let not he says it again let not your
[54:53] heart be troubled neither Let It Be
[54:56] Afraid

[55:03] that's me Lord he starts out this great
[55:06] chapter let not your heart be troubled

[55:21] where I am now and where I'm going you
[55:24] can come to now and then you can join me
[55:27] and he concludes it all right before
[55:29] then he's going to switch to
[55:31] fruitfulness
[55:32] and he says peace I leave with you my
[55:35] peace I give unto you not as the world
[55:38] giveth I told him in Virginia it's not
[55:40] about how many zeros are in your bank
