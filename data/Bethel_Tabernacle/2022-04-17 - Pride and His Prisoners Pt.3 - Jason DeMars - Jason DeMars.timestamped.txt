[2:18] good morning everyone
[2:21] lord bless you let's stand up
[2:24] happy easter
[2:25] i guess everybody's still uh
[2:28] at home preparing finishing up the last
[2:30] second preparations of food so
[2:33] for this afternoon
[2:35] amen let's pray
[2:38] heavenly father we just come before you
[2:40] now lord and we ask that your holy
[2:42] spirit would be with us
[2:44] speaking to us teaching us lord
[2:47] guiding us into all truth and convicting
[2:49] our hearts of sin
[2:51] lord we just we want you to be glorified
[2:53] and magnified and lifted up this morning
[2:55] we ask in jesus name
[2:57] amen
[2:58] or the markets the other the pride and
[3:00] his prisoners
[3:02] part three that's gonna be my
[3:05] topic this morning continuing on that
[3:08] i'm looking at
[3:09] proverbs 16 verse five
[3:12] and we'll have that up on the screen in
[3:14] a moment
[3:18] everyone that is proud in heart
[3:21] is an abomination to the lord
[3:24] though though hand joined in hand he
[3:26] shall not be unpunished amen may the
[3:28] lord add the blessing to the reading of
[3:30] his word you can be seated
[3:34] so pride is a
[3:37] as the prophet said pride such a cursed
[3:40] thing so awful so
[3:43] evil is pride and i want to just address
[3:47] something
[3:48] you know there's
[3:49] as with any word there's multiple
[3:51] different meanings you know you
[3:53] you might say to your child i'm so proud
[3:55] of you today well that's not a bad thing
[3:57] but it can become a bad thing it can
[4:00] become something that's such a such a
[4:02] focus and such a all-consuming thing
[4:04] that it becomes bad
[4:06] um
[4:07] it comes becomes a negative thing but
[4:09] being proud of your child for an
[4:11] accomplishment
[4:12] or for the person that they are that's
[4:14] just that's just fine that's wonderful
[4:18] um
[4:18] i think it was brother
[4:20] brother brad campbell texted me after
[4:22] the part one i did of this he said i'm
[4:24] so proud of your
[4:26] what a good job you did and i had to
[4:28] laugh because of course using a play on
[4:31] words because we have different meanings
[4:32] for different words today
[4:35] the world has tried to redefine the
[4:37] meaning
[4:39] of the word proud and it's almost always
[4:42] a positive
[4:44] statement
[4:45] in this world as christians we
[4:47] understand it's a bad it's
[4:49] it's a negative word it's not something
[4:51] that we want to be around and be
[4:53] involved with because of what we've
[4:54] talked about before of god's attitude
[4:57] towards pride but today
[4:59] they have
[5:00] they're proud of every kind of
[5:02] fetish and
[5:04] evil desire and gay pride and
[5:07] trans pride and this pride and that
[5:09] pride
[5:10] and it's such a strange thing
[5:13] i mean really when you
[5:15] when you think about the reality of it
[5:17] it's it's a strange thing
[5:19] you're you're proud
[5:21] you know in this in this world you're
[5:24] proud of your sin and in fact you're
[5:25] celebrated
[5:27] you know by the left wing world
[5:31] you're literally celebrated and
[5:33] hollywood
[5:34] you can't hardly watch
[5:36] anything even something
[5:38] quote unquote clean coming out of
[5:40] hollywood they're going to have
[5:41] homosexual agenda
[5:44] or transsexual agenda perversion
[5:47] shoved down our throats constantly
[5:50] and so
[5:51] this this pride in sin
[5:55] of course is prophesied woe unto them
[5:57] that call
[5:58] evil good
[6:00] and good evil
[6:02] what is what does our
[6:03] world's media do to a staunch
[6:07] bible-believing christian they hate him
[6:09] the whole the whole
[6:11] mechanism
[6:12] of hollywood and
[6:15] media
[6:16] is aimed with a gun pointed against
[6:18] a committed
[6:20] born-again christian it's a joke
[6:23] it's a joke to them
[6:25] that's that's what it is it's so absurd
[6:27] it's a joke to them and yet we'll have
[6:30] islamophobia addressed and homophobia
[6:33] addressed and all these things addressed
[6:35] in in hollywood and by media
[6:38] and what what is it this is rebellion
[6:40] against god and that's the heart of what
[6:43] pride is
[6:44] pride is rebellion against the almighty
[6:48] and it doesn't matter what form it comes
[6:50] in as we as we're going to read
[6:55] in the unity of the one god in the
[6:57] church i think this is the fourth screen
[7:00] perhaps brother mark
[7:03] brother branham says that's what happens
[7:04] to these meetings
[7:06] when people go forth in revival and and
[7:08] men are just led to an intellectual
[7:11] conception
[7:12] he goes off and joins some church
[7:14] and let it go at that satisfied that's
[7:16] all right there's nothing to all this
[7:18] other nonsense
[7:19] we should not have it bastard says oh
[7:21] that's all that was way back in another
[7:24] age
[7:24] and the first thing you know that devil
[7:26] returns back with seven other devils and
[7:30] he becomes a religious devil then he's
[7:32] really filled then he's got pride
[7:35] and jealousy
[7:38] so again of course that's religious
[7:40] pride the person is not an unbeliever
[7:42] and this is in the religious pride in
[7:44] the realms of
[7:45] denominationalism we don't believe in
[7:47] the power of god moving in the church we
[7:49] don't believe in miracles we don't
[7:50] believe in supernatural we don't believe
[7:52] in divine healing we have
[7:55] all that we want we're baptist or we're
[7:58] presbyterian or we're lutheran all right
[8:00] that's a religious thing it's it seems
[8:03] like the same spirits
[8:05] are trying to get into the message today
[8:08] either it's either as brother jason's
[8:10] been talking about it's either we don't
[8:11] believe in the
[8:12] miracles and things that was for brother
[8:13] branham's ministry or it's that's all we
[8:15] think about that's all we talk about
[8:17] it's not about the word
[8:18] there's a balance we want both
[8:21] we want the power of god moving in our
[8:22] lives and we want all of the all the
[8:24] word speaks to us
[8:26] pride would push us to one way or
[8:28] another
[8:29] pride over what pride over the movement
[8:31] that we're a part of the church we're a
[8:33] part of pride over the pastor that we're
[8:35] following the minister that we're
[8:37] following oh and he has wonderful points
[8:39] and he has a thousand quotes to back up
[8:40] his side both sides have a thousand
[8:43] quotes to back up their side why because
[8:46] it is an aside
[8:48] there's a truth right down the center
[8:50] because both things are true we want the
[8:51] power of god we want the word we don't
[8:53] want to live on emotions
[8:55] but we understand that emotions follow i
[8:57] can't hardly make it through a service
[8:59] here without crying
[9:02] without rejoicing without all the
[9:04] different spectrums of emotions going
[9:06] through me why because i love the lord
[9:08] and it moves me
[9:10] but i don't live based on that i say oh
[9:12] i wasn't emotional therefore i'm not
[9:13] saved no we don't live by that
[9:16] we don't go by that we go by the word
[9:19] and that word brings power cs lewis
[9:22] writes according to christian teachers
[9:25] the essential vice the utmost evil is
[9:28] pride
[9:30] unchastity anger greed drunkenness and
[9:32] all that are mere flea bites in
[9:34] comparison
[9:36] it was through pride that the devil
[9:38] became the devil
[9:40] pride leads to every other vice it is
[9:42] the complete anti-god state of mind
[9:46] it is pride which has been the chief
[9:48] cause of misery in every nation
[9:50] and every family since the world began
[9:54] what a statement
[9:56] i think
[9:57] it bears re repeating i've said it
[10:00] multiple times in each of these messages
[10:03] you have two sides of the of of
[10:06] measurement you have pride and humility
[10:08] pride and humility is a measurement of
[10:10] self
[10:11] just like we talked about the the
[10:14] thermometer not the current thermometers
[10:16] young people
[10:17] you know the old ones that
[10:19] have mercury in it and goes up and down
[10:22] okay
[10:23] so those thermometers as it as it fills
[10:26] up temperature gets hotter that's self
[10:28] filling up that's pride
[10:30] and as it goes down it's emptied out
[10:33] it goes to the bottom goes out
[10:36] that's humility
[10:37] right
[10:38] and so
[10:40] pride we can all be in some different
[10:42] state of that
[10:44] because it's a process of being changed
[10:47] and transformed by the renewing of our
[10:48] mind
[10:50] you know brother branham shows this you
[10:52] can be you can be a religious person
[10:54] and be full of pride you know you've
[10:56] submitted
[10:58] yourself to the word to a certain point
[11:01] but then
[11:02] for the sake of something in your mind
[11:05] you refuse to go any further with god
[11:09] right and that that can be that can be a
[11:11] state even in a person that's born of
[11:13] the spirit of god
[11:14] it's a it's a process of god
[11:17] getting pride out of our lives
[11:20] and we have to submit and surrender
[11:22] that's why paul says i die daily
[11:25] we have to die to ourself
[11:27] every day it's not something that we can
[11:29] do i did it once and it's over with i
[11:30] don't have any pride in my life anymore
[11:34] no
[11:35] it's a continual constant
[11:38] battle and fight waging war against the
[11:40] enemy to be in a position where pride
[11:43] isn't ruling over us
[11:46] because when pride rules over us
[11:48] there's fighting
[11:50] there's there's there's anger
[11:52] there's all these different things that
[11:54] flow out of it
[11:56] so the root the the root of
[11:59] godliness is humility
[12:01] the root of ungodliness is pride
[12:10] romans 12 3 says for i say
[12:14] through the grace given unto me to every
[12:17] man that is among you not to think of
[12:19] himself more highly
[12:21] than he ought to think but to think
[12:23] soberly according as god has dealt to
[12:26] every man the measure of faith it's very
[12:28] interesting when you look at this verse
[12:30] look how many times
[12:32] paul uses the word think
[12:35] or another another way to put it is to
[12:37] be minded so we have to be very careful
[12:40] how
[12:41] we think
[12:44] what kind of thinking we have in our
[12:46] life and this is about
[12:49] ourselves
[12:50] how we think about ourselves
[12:52] is very important that's a whole
[12:55] another message in itself
[12:58] but you you you learn to talk to
[13:01] yourself
[13:03] in a certain way
[13:04] from young ages and it's shaped by the
[13:07] world around you whether it be parents
[13:09] classmates schoolmates
[13:12] and if you're not careful you start to
[13:14] talk
[13:14] use talk to yourself
[13:17] in a way that is putting yourself in a
[13:19] position that's different than what god
[13:21] has put you in
[13:23] we don't have any right to think about
[13:24] ourselves differently than the way god
[13:26] thinks about us
[13:28] you know the scripture says not to think
[13:30] of himself more highly
[13:32] than he ought to think and it goes
[13:33] without saying or more lowly
[13:36] than he ought to think
[13:38] but to think soberly the word sober
[13:40] means to be modest think modestly or you
[13:44] could say balanced
[13:46] think in a balanced way so he uses
[13:49] think think think every three times so
[13:52] if you look at that we have that up on
[13:54] the screen
[13:55] paul is in the in the previous uh
[13:58] go forward again brother mark
[14:00] paul is using sort of a play on words
[14:02] not to be high-minded above
[14:05] what he ought to be minded but so to be
[14:07] minded
[14:09] as to be sober-minded
[14:11] so he sees it's almost impossible to
[14:14] translate what he's doing
[14:16] in the greek language to english but
[14:18] that's probably as good as you can get
[14:20] it we're not to be high-minded we're not
[14:23] to think big things great things above
[14:25] ourselves but we should be minded so
[14:27] that we are thinking of ourselves the
[14:30] way god
[14:31] thinks about us
[14:33] and
[14:34] [Music]
[14:35] anyways who you are what you are
[14:38] is a result of
[14:39] god
[14:40] dealing to you the measure of faith now
[14:44] we have a basic there's two different
[14:45] things we have a basic understanding of
[14:48] ourselves
[14:49] as humans
[14:51] that's been trained to us
[14:53] through through our lives and through
[14:55] our lifetime
[14:57] basic level
[14:59] needs to be
[15:00] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[15:03] so that we think about ourselves the way
[15:05] god thinks about us
[15:09] this the the way we talk about ourselves
[15:11] if someone else did it we'd punch him in
[15:13] the face
[15:17] or a husband would punch someone else
[15:20] in the face of the
[15:22] of their wife if they talk to their wife
[15:23] that way but each of us have a way that
[15:25] we talk to ourselves
[15:27] so negatively
[15:29] and
[15:30] we shouldn't do that because what it
[15:32] hinders us
[15:33] in so many ways in our lives and what is
[15:36] it ultimately
[15:38] it's just it's just pride in a different
[15:40] form it's pro pride and it's you're
[15:42] resisting what god says about you
[15:47] [Music]
[15:49] okay i'll i'll speak on that another
[15:51] time i'm gonna lay that down that'll be
[15:54] the next sunday school
[15:57] think the way god has dealt the measures
[15:59] of grace he's given everybody
[16:01] gifts in the body of christ
[16:04] and he wants us to think the way
[16:07] he thinks about us
[16:11] in testimony brother branham says those
[16:12] arkansas people are poor as they can be
[16:15] but brother under that now i'm going to
[16:17] go into a number of quotes
[16:19] and the purpose of going these quotes is
[16:21] not just to have a lot of information to
[16:23] read but for you to catch
[16:25] god's attitude about pride through the
[16:28] prophet
[16:31] and look at the different circumstances
[16:33] that he identifies
[16:35] uh pride with those arkansas people are
[16:37] poor as they can be but brother
[16:39] under them old blue shirts beat some
[16:41] real good true holy ghost filled hearts
[16:43] yes sir i'd rather have one of them with
[16:46] me any time than maybe a slicker with
[16:48] his collar turned around in the back and
[16:50] i couldn't trust him out of my sight yes
[16:51] indeedy yes indeed
[16:54] just i tell you this old time religion
[16:56] brother it straightens you up that's
[16:57] right it'll make a silk dress and a
[16:59] calico put their arms around one another
[17:01] and call sister is that right it'll make
[17:03] a tuxedo suit and a pair of overalls
[17:06] call each other brother that's what
[17:08] it'll do brother
[17:09] it'll clean you up it'll make no
[17:12] difference in you it tears down that
[17:13] self and starch and pride that we've got
[17:18] amen that's what the holy ghost does it
[17:20] tears down
[17:21] you're not from my group
[17:23] let's let's let's just change the
[17:25] wording up a little bit you're not from
[17:27] my group you're not from my
[17:29] movement in the message oops
[17:33] you don't believe like i do we're going
[17:35] to treat you different
[17:37] wow
[17:38] that's pride
[17:40] it's pride it's self-centered
[17:43] pride protecting your own self your own
[17:46] ideas you'd never thought
[17:49] maybe
[17:50] you're wrong and maybe the person has a
[17:52] point
[17:54] maybe you should pray about what's
[17:56] happening
[17:57] and ask the lord to give you his mind
[17:59] and his glasses and his thought
[18:03] in the unwelcome christ brother branham
[18:05] says this big that big pharisee asked my
[18:08] lord to come and let him set over there
[18:10] with that dung on his feet wouldn't give
[18:12] him any oil let him set their stinking
[18:15] unattended unrefreshed unwelcomed and
[18:18] all of them looking on oh look at him oh
[18:20] god have mercy on the sinful world
[18:22] what a horrible curse pride is
[18:25] oh you're too good sure we got a church
[18:27] that knows better than that we don't
[18:29] believe in divine healing ah we have
[18:31] nothing to do with that pharisee
[18:33] jesus is in your town amen entertain him
[18:36] love him embrace him and love him
[18:40] oh i see him sitting there with head
[18:42] bowed he's usually unwelcome among the
[18:44] rich
[18:45] they got so much of the world they don't
[18:47] have time for jesus
[18:49] great religious orders they don't have
[18:51] time for him so
[18:52] there he sets unwashed feet nobody
[18:54] paying any attention to him you know
[18:58] that kind of spirit still exists oh sure
[19:01] pride
[19:02] it's a cursed thing
[19:04] pride
[19:07] it's an incredible statement it's easy
[19:09] to shovel it off on denominations or
[19:12] somebody else but you know we've come
[19:15] a long way
[19:17] from that place and we're far removed
[19:20] from even
[19:22] this denominational type of thinking and
[19:24] i don't believe god just sets that there
[19:26] he put this in the message and just oh
[19:28] it just leaves there and doesn't have
[19:29] any application to us
[19:31] it's so easy in any movement it doesn't
[19:34] have to be an official denomination
[19:36] to have this attitude of pride
[19:40] in self
[19:41] and looking down
[19:43] on other people
[19:44] it should find no place
[19:46] amongst
[19:47] true believers
[19:49] to look down at people that don't
[19:51] believe like you don't dress like you
[19:53] down don't act like you you understand
[19:56] that you would be just like everyone
[19:59] else
[20:00] unless god came by his grace opened your
[20:04] eyes
[20:06] changed your heart changed your life it
[20:08] took god from the start to the finish it
[20:10] wasn't because of how good you are
[20:13] did he choose jacob because jacob was
[20:16] better a better dude than esau
[20:19] no
[20:20] he chose jacob because he chose jacob
[20:24] he loved jacob because he loved jacob
[20:28] and he loves you because he chose to
[20:30] love you
[20:31] nothing to do with your goodness nothing
[20:33] to do with what you've accomplished
[20:35] nothing to do
[20:36] with your parents
[20:38] the church that you're in
[20:40] the list can go on he didn't choose you
[20:43] for that purpose now he brings the
[20:45] surrounding circumstances in order to
[20:47] accomplish something in your life
[20:49] but that has nothing to do with value
[20:51] god has already established
[20:53] every single person's value
[20:55] when he said
[20:57] we're made in his image and likeness
[21:00] we're to be a reflection of his
[21:03] life and his character and he's made
[21:05] everyone
[21:07] everyone
[21:08] to be that
[21:10] okay so if you look like a human
[21:13] you're designed to be that way now we
[21:16] understand he chose some
[21:18] for eternal life and he chose some for
[21:20] not having eternal life that's
[21:21] scriptural but that's his own choosing
[21:24] and it's nothing to do with the with the
[21:26] va with how good you are
[21:29] it's his love and it's his grace
[21:33] and we have no right to think better of
[21:35] ourselves than other people
[21:38] we we should look at everyone and say
[21:40] that we are their servants
[21:42] and our purpose exists
[21:44] so that they
[21:45] could get saved
[21:52] you pray and pray and pray for revival
[21:55] and when revival gives begins to break
[21:58] out somewhere you say
[22:00] not in my church
[22:01] have nothing to do with that over there
[22:03] oh you actor
[22:05] pride head up in the air hypocrite
[22:08] shame on you
[22:14] just let that sit there let the the holy
[22:17] spirit
[22:19] brood over us
[22:20] i stand at the door and knock brother
[22:22] branham says there's another little door
[22:23] called pride oh what a horrible little
[22:27] black devils is all pinned up in that
[22:29] heart of pride
[22:30] listen to the way the prophet is
[22:32] speaking about this
[22:35] a horrible little black devil
[22:38] is pinned up
[22:40] in a heart
[22:41] of pride thinking you're better than
[22:43] somebody else
[22:45] well i wouldn't send my children over
[22:46] here they don't dress right the people
[22:48] who goes there isn't in my class
[22:54] what a horrible little devil
[22:57] if
[22:59] christ is in your heart we're all one
[23:01] class because of one spirit
[23:04] we're all baptized into one
[23:06] body pride feels just a little a little
[23:09] complex you have oh you don't want jesus
[23:11] to touch that
[23:13] because it would degrade your social
[23:15] standing in the community
[23:19] and the queen of the south brother
[23:20] branham says the same thing was thought
[23:22] when jesus was born in bethlehem
[23:24] they never sang hosanna is when the king
[23:26] was born but the angels sung it not the
[23:28] kings and potentates but the shepherds
[23:30] on the hillsides he wasn't born in a
[23:32] fine decorated hospital room
[23:34] with pink dressings hanging down
[23:37] he was born in a stinking manger
[23:40] how could they ever go to hear a man
[23:41] like that no matter what he done you see
[23:43] what pride and selfishness does
[23:46] it shuts you out from the kingdom of god
[23:48] i wonder sometime as we think what will
[23:51] happen
[23:52] to this generation
[23:54] from the doors inside the door
[23:58] then there's a another little door and
[23:59] that little door is called pride oh
[24:02] that's a hard one to get open you know
[24:04] it's just
[24:05] human beings are just prone to think
[24:07] that maybe they're just a little better
[24:08] than the joneses you know
[24:11] especially here in america
[24:13] you just paint your steps red watch your
[24:15] neighbor paint his red new sister wear
[24:17] just a little certain thing on your hat
[24:19] when you go to church your neighbor just
[24:21] can't stand it
[24:24] in the message to the laodicean church
[24:26] brother branham says now we need to let
[24:28] him in when he comes in worship him and
[24:31] said come in lord be my savior be my god
[24:33] be my ruler be my healer
[24:35] he might be all that i want to know in
[24:37] life be be my lord take everything that
[24:40] i've got lord and rule it take my
[24:42] emotions i will not get ashamed anymore
[24:44] take my pride stand in the door and
[24:46] clothe me lord with your word
[24:52] going to see a revival start then he
[24:54] says
[24:55] stand in my private life lord
[24:57] make me what you'd want me to be let me
[25:00] not take my own thoughts but take yours
[25:02] god lead me o lord
[25:04] he will never take you from the word he
[25:05] will keep you right in his word not
[25:07] because the baptist do it the pentecost
[25:09] do it presbyterian do what got me but
[25:12] because god's word said so you believe
[25:14] it
[25:16] amen
[25:17] amen second timothy 3 1
[25:21] so speaking of the lat the perilous
[25:23] times in the last days
[25:26] verse 2 says for men shall be lovers of
[25:28] their own selves covetous
[25:30] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[25:33] to parents unthankful unholy
[25:35] without natural affection truce breakers
[25:38] false accusers incontinent fierce
[25:39] despisers of those that are good
[25:42] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[25:44] pleasure more than lovers of god having
[25:46] a form of godliness but denying the
[25:48] power thereof from such turn away
[25:51] so here we have a powerless
[25:54] religion
[25:56] that's what we end up with but what does
[25:57] it start with all these other attributes
[26:02] of course
[26:03] all time through history
[26:06] if you read this go back to
[26:08] second timothy three
[26:09] verse two all time through history of
[26:11] course we had people that loved their
[26:12] own selves that were covetous boasters
[26:15] proud people did these things verse
[26:17] three verse four
[26:20] all these different things you see
[26:23] that was all through history
[26:24] but
[26:26] paul is telling timothy in the last time
[26:28] there's going to be a concentration
[26:31] of all of this
[26:33] in the church
[26:36] it's a spirit working on religious
[26:39] people in this day
[26:41] that would produce
[26:42] such wickedness
[26:44] and it's a powerless religion that
[26:46] produces that wickedness
[26:49] oh don't you know that
[26:50] there's message people that confess to
[26:52] believe this message but what they're
[26:54] believing is a powerless religion
[26:58] and you cross up them and doctrine one
[27:01] time they'll fight you as hard as they
[27:02] can
[27:06] the love of god won't come out it'll be
[27:08] just a total fight
[27:11] it's a shame
[27:13] behold i stand at the door and knock
[27:15] sermon
[27:17] but i'll but you'll let the devil push
[27:19] every old ungodly thing you can down in
[27:21] that soul and be satisfied with it
[27:23] that's true and right oh don't fool my
[27:25] private life and don't have nothing to
[27:26] do with my little pride you know i got
[27:28] some pride i'm a southerner
[27:30] i am too but brother when we become a
[27:32] christian we lose all of that that's
[27:34] right we must be christ-like
[27:38] in the sermon all the days of our life
[27:40] now we hear so much today about we are
[27:42] free
[27:43] this this quote really struck me we are
[27:45] free oh
[27:47] we live in a beautiful america we are
[27:49] free
[27:50] oh the air is full of it books and a
[27:52] road of it thousands of them
[27:54] but you're a million miles from being
[27:57] free
[27:59] you're not free
[28:00] don't you be deceived by that
[28:03] america is one of the greatest deceived
[28:05] nations
[28:07] and in more bondage than any place
[28:10] i know of
[28:12] they're worse in bondage than communism
[28:14] could put them in communism can only
[28:17] hurt the body they can only put the body
[28:19] in bondage but when the devil comes in
[28:21] he puts the soul in bondage and man is a
[28:24] slave
[28:25] america is a bunch of slaves
[28:28] you may be a slave to pride
[28:32] that was that was so stunning
[28:34] to me looking at that at that quote
[28:37] just to really think this is god's
[28:40] viewpoint about it
[28:43] you're more we're more in bondage in
[28:45] this nation everyone you go on you go on
[28:48] the news and you watch the different fox
[28:50] news cnn
[28:51] all the other alternative news places
[28:54] and what what you see is a deceived
[28:57] world both sides of the coin
[29:00] entirely deceived
[29:03] worse than what communism could
[29:05] total bondage total
[29:07] slavery to sin and wickedness
[29:10] and the main
[29:12] uh promoter of it worldwide
[29:19] i'm proud to be an american
[29:21] or at least i know i'm free okay
[29:24] what does the prophet have to say about
[29:25] that
[29:29] what it takes to over outcome all
[29:31] unbelief our faith
[29:33] and today when the church is sick the
[29:35] sickness is piled up and the people
[29:37] because of intellectual pride and so
[29:39] forth is getting away
[29:40] from divine healing getting away from
[29:43] the holy spirit
[29:44] god still hears the cry of his people
[29:47] somebody's got to go
[29:50] in the sermon the way back and the holy
[29:51] spirit is that leader the one who leads
[29:53] him by still waters and gives him
[29:55] everlasting life
[29:56] when they seen these people lose all
[29:58] their pride they got to dancing in the
[30:00] spirit they got to speaking in tongues
[30:02] four tons of fire flying out of them and
[30:04] here they all come out a bunch of
[30:06] galileans speaking in every language
[30:08] under heaven they didn't know what all
[30:10] this meant those doctors of divinity was
[30:12] really surprised they didn't know what
[30:14] had happened but they had been
[30:15] inoculated you know they got to asking
[30:17] what all this means
[30:20] in other words this the power of god
[30:22] falls and people through pride say i
[30:24] don't want that i don't need that
[30:25] that'll make me look silly
[30:28] we when the power of god falls we just
[30:30] say amen lord
[30:32] whatever you want me to do that's what i
[30:34] want to do
[30:35] get all the starchiness and pride out of
[30:37] me
[30:40] in the pergaman church age i'm
[30:42] closing shortly
[30:44] brother branham says too often when men
[30:46] are signally used of the lord
[30:49] they become lifted up with pride
[30:52] and he says but not so with martin
[30:54] amen and let it not be so with us
[30:57] when we're used of the lord may may we
[30:59] just get more and more
[31:01] humble
[31:03] all right i'm just going to finish with
[31:04] james 4
[31:06] 6.
[31:07] moreover he gives greater grace this is
[31:09] from the west translation he gives
[31:11] greater grace for this reason he says
[31:14] god sets himself in battle array against
[31:17] the arrogant and haughty but gives grace
[31:20] to the humble
[31:21] and lowly
[31:23] amen let's stand and pray
[31:28] gracious father we just come before you
[31:29] now and we're so thankful for your word
[31:31] and your life
[31:32] we asked lord that your holy spirit
[31:34] would just
[31:35] have have your way
[31:38] this morning in the worship and the
[31:40] preaching of the word
[31:42] may you be glorified and lifted up lord
[31:44] help each one of us
[31:46] to get get ourselves out of the way lord
[31:48] and just be under expectation
[31:52] we ask these things in jesus name amen
[31:55] amen we'll
[31:58] dismiss shortly and be back with the
[32:00] song service in a few moments
