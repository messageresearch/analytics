moments Lord that we would lay aside every weight we would lay aside every sin we would lay aside every care of the world of the things of life and Lord may we be able to for these next few days as it were to shut into your presence Lord where you could come in this meeting in a special way Lord you see the hearts here tonight father Behind These Hands Behind These hearts or needs Lord maybe maybe some would think their need is insignificant Lord maybe some would think their need is too big but father Lord I a firm believer tonight that if I was to pass this microphone through the entire

your spirit into this meeting tonight may you take preminent Among Us Lord father may you drive out every evil spirit Lord we don't know what this building has been used for but Lord these next few

it's a it's a special time to be together here this weekend and the opening night I believe the Lord Lord has something for us don't you amen if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us we want to turn in the Book of Proverbs we have two places we want to read tonight the Book of Proverbs the 4th chapter and then also we're going to look in the Book of John the 7th chapter and we just want to say God bless you all this evening we thank brother Jason brother Matt the ministry here for the invitation to be here tonight and to speak to you this week from the message of the hour and of course we are definitely remembering our brother Donnie Reagan and the family there in the church and John City Amen believ in the Lord just to put his arms around them in this time and amen many uh many people here tonight I look around see many friends we say God bless you all this evening but we're just going to go straight to the word here in the Book of Proverbs the fourth chapter in the 23rd verse uh the Bible here speaks to us very direct it says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life and man I I believe that's more than a suggestion I believe that's a commandment keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of Life put away from thee a forward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee in the book of St John the 7th chapter in the book of St John the 7th chapter I want to read one verse there in St John chapter 7 verse 38 Jesus here is speaking in St John 7 and verse 38 and he says these words he says he that believeth on me how many believes on him he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow somebody say flow shall flow rivers of Living Water notice it didn't say out of my belly but out of his belly the one that believes on him shall flow rivers of Living Water amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight in The Opening Service here I want to speak to you on a thought if the Lord would help us and I want to title this tonight unclogging the channels of our heart unclogging the channels of our heart you know I know we're all very well aware tonight that this is the opening night of the meeting and I think it's a good night to open up all the channels amen of our heart that the Lord could come into there and do something special for us brother BR said in the message getting in the spirit he said we got the people he said now just clean out the channel see the people's all right he said but get the channels cleaned out so that the Holy Spirit can come in he said all your fanaticisms and isms and everything else that's in the church amen we just need to clean the thing out how many how many believes we got the people here tonight we just need the spirit of God Amen to clean out the channels of our our heart in the message the lamb and the dove another place you said every person is a spirit every one of you has got a soul and when you go to believe and it's in that channel of Faith do you believe that certainly and if you can get with one Accord he said then that's when the Holy Spirit will just move in amen if you can just get in one Accord then that is when the Holy Spirit will just move in now another place just laying a foundation he said I seen not long ago where they went into the Garners of Egypt and got some wheat that was put in there about 2500 years ago ago yes more than that about 3,000 years ago but in there by Joseph it was put in there by Joseph and some of the weed had been laying there for all those years and planted in the ground and it produced again now no matter how long this gospel lays here 2,000 years we've had mockers and scoffers saying the days of Miracles is passed amen put that word in the right kind of a heart and it'll produce again exactly what it did in the first time because it's the word of God see it's got to come into a Channel of faith and as long as it laid in the Garner then it didn't need nothing it just stayed there as a memorial so how many amen can agree with me tonight that the word amen is not good enough just to lay in the Bible it's not good enough just to lay in the tapes or to lay in the books amen amen but God has ordained this word to come off of the pages of the Bible to come out of the tapes and come off of the pages of the book amen and to fall into your heart because the prophet said amen every seed will produce of its own kind amen and if it falls in the right kind of ground amen it will produce the right kind of harvest I believe tonight that there's seeds amen that's laying in the word of God for healing here this weekend I believe there's seeds in the word of God for deliverance and miracles and signs and wonders amen but we've got to clean out our heart Amen in order to make room for the word to come in there now you all know that there's there's four seasons to a year there's a spring there's a summer there's a fall and there's a winter we're actually just now amen beginning the first stages or the first days amen of what we call fall and when we think of spring amen we think of a spring cleaning so amen maybe I could say it like this tonight we're going to have a spring cleaning on the first day of fall we're going to have a spring cleaning Amen in this meeting tonight when you when you have a spring cleaning what you begin to do is you begin to clean out the closet you begin to clean out the garage you you begin to go through the house and look for things that's laying there that's taking up space or amen you're looking to remove something to put something else there amen will be more beneficial to you than what is there and you know I believe amen that there's a lot of things amen that the devil can put in our heart I believe he can put complexes I believe he can put fears and doubts and confusions amen and questions but I believe that God is sent a message in this generation amen and it's a message of dynamic power it's a message of holy ghost power amen and I think it's time to remove the complexes and make room for the power of the Holy Ghost I think it's time Amen to remove the doubts and the Superstition and the skepticisms and the unbelief amen and let the power of the Holy Ghost come in our heart amen I love what David said he said who can understand his HS he said cleanse thou me from Secret faults Amen in Psalm 51:2 he said Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity amen and clean me from my sin in verse five he said behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me amen but in verse seven he said Purge me with hisp and I shall be clean amen wash me and I shall be whiter than snow amen David goes in Psalm 79:9 and says help us oh god of our Salvation amen for the glory of thy name and Deliver Us amen and Purge away our sins for thy name's sake amen David was praying that God Amen would send the hsip amen to purge away his sins amen for his name's sake how many would agree that we all need a purge and amen I don't know if you how long you've been serving God maybe 5 years or 20 years or or 10 years but every single one of us tonight amen need a purging of the Holy Ghost Amen to wash our mind to wash our spirits and the prophet of God said I do believe in a Purgatory he said but I believe it's right now he said you purge your own soul what does purgatory mean it means to purge when you see you've done something wrong amen then get out there and clean it out of You by confession and crying and fasting and praying someone even laughed at me when the Lord came here not long ago and give me Vision always wanted to see about binding that serpent always wondered how to he said I should step out like that when that's what I've wanted all my life then I be to fast and pray and said what must you do for that and I said in there he said I was not sincere enough after he come then I wanted to purge myself amen there's a lot of devils that need to be bound this weekend there's a lot of spirits that need to be bound there's a lot of demons that need to be sent back to the hell that they come out of Amen but I tell you what's not going to do do it is her feelings is not going to do it and emotions is not going to do it and Sensations is not going to do it amen but the word coming in power amen will put a faith in your heart Amen to bind that devil and put him in his place as a son and daughter of God listen I don't believe you got to leave here with the demons you came with I don't believe you got to go back with that Old Demon of fear that Old Demon of doubt and turn torment amen I believe there's a God in the building tonight amen that can take the thing that's binding you and canine that devil and put that devil in his place and release you from the condemnation release you from the guilt amen a prophet had to become more sincere to bind the devil then you best believe we have to become more sincere he said after he come he said then I wanted to purge myself amen not wait till you die and let some priest try to purge you he said Purge your souls amen but see they took it out of the authoritative word and they put it over in the hands of some man-made Dogma he said to bring money into the church because they look at worldly things worldly Church Great powers in the world political Powers amen but God looks to his word and any word that's contrary to God's word is wrong amen as far as I'm concerned amen it's the word or nothing amen can we start this meeting off on that declaration amen as far as I'm concerned it's the word or it's nothing it's not the way I feel it's not the way I think it's not the way things have been amen it's the word or it's nothing amen and I believe that the word of God will defeat the Devil anywhere any time any place under any condition amen and that word is here tonight to defeat the Devil amen that's trying to defeat the church amen I believe as the prophet preached several times he preached a message on doors amen he would call it doors and doors and what he would say is there are many doors in the heart of the human being amen now you know why someone knocks on a door amen is because they're trying Amen to gain access to what's behind that door brother BR said there's the door of Pride he said there's the door of the private life he said there's the Door of Faith amen see there's all kinds of doors Amen in the door of the heart amen so there's one door to the heart but then there's doors indoors right amen there's one door to the heart but then there's doors and doors now you know what in proverbs 4 that that Solomon instructs us amen I I lost it in my ear if you could give it back to me I'd appreciate it amen Solomon instructs us Amen to keep my heart with all diligence brother said listen my Christian friend if there's an ALT in your heart against anyone you go to them now and be reconciled and forget all the past he said if you've been having an up and down life remember something amen has come into that heart something is moved into those thoughts no matter who your enemy is love him amen no matter what's happened let it go after all amen you're in a field with weeds and we realize amen that we must both grow together we've got to come up up together amen but a good whale cannot put forth amen evil Waters and neither can an evil whale amen put forth good Waters amen and a tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit amen and a good fruit cannot come from a corrupt tree he said so let's either make the whole well clean or let's make the whole well dirty amen one or the other for it's dirty to begin with amen so let's clean out for whales this morning and say Lord pour your spirit in me amen and Lead Me and guide me amen is there a David among us tonight that says Lord pour your spirit out amen wash the whales of my heart wash the whes of my spirit amen pour your spirit out Lord amen if it's correction I'll take it amen if it's rejoicing I'll take it amen but as long as it's coming from the word I will receive what the spirit is s in this age Amen to correct my heart so that I can be a tree that'll bring forth good fruit as the father has commanded me to do amen I don't know about you I don't want to be a Halfway Christian amen I don't want to drink from a hybrid whale you say brother Andrew what is a hybrid whale well a hybrid whale amen is something amen thank you brother it's something that is mixed amen with clean and dirty water do you realize that we are not drinking from a hybrid whale amen we are drinking from an artisian whale we are drinking from a whale amen that's not mixed with man's ideas it's not mixed with denomination it's not mixed with psychology it's not mixed with education amen but the whale that we are drinking of Amen it's got the power of the Holy Ghost in it it's got the power to open the blind eyes it's got the power to raise the dead it's got the power to bind the devil amen that's why we can have a confidence tonight that we can leave here clean because the whale we're drawing from is a clean wh in the Book of James the Bible said amen out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing he said my brethren these things amen ought not to be so amen do a fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter amen can the Fig Tree my brethren bear Olive berries either a Vine or fig amen so can no Fountain amen both yield salt water and fresh amen I don't know about you but I don't want to serve God Amen with a perverse lip amen I don't want to serve God on my good days I speak good things and on my bad days I speak bad things and when I'm on the mountain I confess the word and when I'm in the valley I question the word am but I believe God has sent us a message Amen to bring us to a place of stability where we can walk every day of our life with an absolute assurance that when I'm on the mountain I'm a Son of God when I'm in the Valley I'm a Son of God on my good days I'm a Son of God on my bad days I'm a Son of God when things are going good I'm a Son of God when things are falling apart I'm a Son of God listen the temporary conditions amen does not change your Eternal position that God gave you from before the found foundation of the world if you ever was a Son of God you always was a Son of God if you ever had a name on the Lamb's Book of Life you always had a name on the Lamb's Book of Life and the reason why God would send a message in this generation is to purge your conscience is to purge your hearts Amen to believe that if God saved me he didn't save me temporarily he saved me for Time and Eternity if God give me the Holy Ghost he didn't give me the Holy Ghost to lose me he give me the holy goes to keep me on my good days bad days in days out days it doesn't make a difference to a child of God they know they're drinking from the Aran well we don't serve God halfway and neither do we have halfway meetings I said we don't serve God halfway and neither do we have halfway meetings amen we don't come together and wait till the atmosphere gets right to believe the word we don't wait till Somebody sings their favorite song to enjoy the blessings of the Holy Ghost amen we are warriors we are Christians and we know how to fight through Devils we know how to fight through Spirits we know how to have church well we might as well go and have church this weekend amen we know how to have church we know how to preach the message we know how to sing the songs of sign we know how to pray until the devil backs up we know how to believe until the situations change because we are believers who have been purged from the word of God listen if you if you ever if you ever see the result amen of a life that serves God halftime amen it'll so it'll put something in you that'll move you from that halfway desire into a full surrender to God I can prove that to you by Jehoshaphat the Bible said that Jehoshaphat witnessed amen the results of a life amen that served God and a life that did not serve God and you know who that life was that was jehoshaphat's father the prophet said but Jehoshaphat amen had purposed in his heart Amen to serve the Lord and to cling to the things that his father David did at the beginning brother says I like that at the beginning the Bible said in other words he went back to the old land mark and they can clean out the rose he said it would be good for Pentecost to go back to the old land mark it would be good for all of us to go back to the old landmark and clean out the rose I'm talking to you he said mostly Pentecostal people what would happen if the church actually went back to the old Landmark he said you talk about it cleaning up there'd really be one around the p Pentecostal Church how many knows that's the truth amen oh how people would be acting different they would be dressing different they would be talking different it just all together be a different church if we went back to the old Landmark amen where we started from and don't get mad at me but I'm going to preach to you what I believe amen the landmark of this church is the message of the hour it's the message or it's nothing it's what a prophet t or it's nothing amen if you're trying to line your life up amen by some layout of sin influence amen you're lining your life up with a wrong influence but if you'll come back to the old landmark and line your life up with the message of the hour it will Quicken something in you amen that you'll change the way you talk you'll change the way you dress you'll change come on now y'all know I'm preaching to you amen it used to be wrong to wear certain things amen but now we're wearing them it used to it used to be wrong to go certain places amen but now we're going there it used to be wrong to listen L to certain things amen but now we're listening to him you know why because some devil has invaded the heart of somebody to believe amen that Holiness don't matter no more and clean living don't matter no more amen but that is a devil that is crawled up out of the pits of hell and I think somebody ought to put their foot on that devil and remember that we have been called to be Sanctified set aside clean living people that it canw from the wh of water in the age we're living in come on church I tell you what happened well I might as well preach I'm here amen we used to could shout amen but now we got to check our clothes before we do cuz things have creeped in we should have never been wearing come on church amen but I believe the first night's a good night to clean out the closet it's a good night to clean out the come on church it's a good night to clean out the music it's a good night to clean out the videos it's a good night to I'm not going to back up on that devil we didn't come here for a halfway youth camp we didn't come here just to sit around and see who could out sing who and who could out preach who we came here that the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost would fall in this building and would change our hearts and the only way it's going to happen is if we go back to the old Landmark I know it's not popular but it's still the message it's still the message this message will change the way you dress it'll change the way you act it'll change the way you conduct yourself it'll change the way you worship it'll change the way you treat one another it'll change the way you look at your church it'll change the way you look at your pastor it'll change the way you read the message if you'll just go back to the old landmark and believe that there's a dynamic power that can cleanse you from the Devils that have crept into our lives there is a possibility Samson for a Revival it'll make you act different it'll make you dress different it'll make you talk different it'll all together be a different church if we went back to the old Landmark where we started from if we went back to where we didn't care to say what a prophet said if we went back to where we didn't care Amen to believe what a prophet T I would to God we'd get a generation that would lose all fear of believing what a prophet told if a prophet said it it don't matter what devil tries to prove it wrong a prophet said it and there's a faith in my heart to believe what he said and there's a strength in my body to say what he said because I know this message will whip the devil anywhere anytime listen I just feel like preaching I've seen this message with the devil in India I've seen this message with the devil in Africa I've seen this message with the devil in Europe and Canada and all across the United States and I believe the same message is going to whip the devil right here in South Carolina this weekend and lives are going to be washed and hearts are going to be cleaned I tell you why the devil don't want you to get a washing is he wants you to believe you're just an insignificant young person and you're the Church of tomorrow but I come to put that devil in his place you're not the Church of tomorrow you're the Church of right now because we might not have we might not have a tomorrow but we got a right now and you're a part of this church you're a part of this message now when you start thinking about the channels you know there's there are many channels Amen in the body of Christ and the prophet of God said that God wants to flow through I looked up the definition brother joshu of a channel a channel is a prepared route amen for something to pass through into something else so when a channel it's a prepared route in other words you didn't come here and get prepared but you came to this age as pre-prepared ground so you came in this age by a seed in your heart prepared to re receive the outpouring of the Holy Ghost in the age who was living but if you're a channel brother Jesse you were not just prepared for something to be poured into you but whatever was poured into you amen would be poured into somebody else through that channel amen because God works through channels so if God can stop your channel he can stop somebody else's Channel you want me prove it to you the prophet of God said amen that a woman come in the prayer line one time amen and brought her baby there and said you been waiting for your baby to be healed and your baby's been healed the whole time you was waiting she said really he said yeah when the woman up there that mother prayed for your baby God Amen healed your baby now what if that woman's heart would have been full of a bunch of fear and skepticism and doubt and God wanted to pour a healing through her channel into that baby there would have been a kink in the host but because her channels of her heart had been unclogged she could receive the outpouring of the power of healing and could lay her hands on that baby and the baby could be healed listen young people amen there's more to this Camp than a bunch of preachers and singers there's a more to this camp and a bunch of counselors amen you got a part in this Camp God wants to use your hands he wants to use your eyes he wants to use your feet he wants to use your mouth he wants to use your body Amen to confess the word of God I say oh God open up the windows of heaven and pour out the fire of the Holy Ghost I don't want to waste one second of this Camp I want to be used for your honor and Glory I want to be a channel in the bethl camp that God can move through into somebody else amen I tell you what God does amen God prepares the channel and the devil does everything he can Amen to clog that channel you know what channels become clogged up it means it becomes blocked so that little or nothing can pass through you know what you got to do to unclog something you got to remove the accumulated matter from it if you're going to unog it you got to remove the accumulated matter from it listen I I don't mean to get too far out here but God don't do bypasses amen God does not leave the matter in the heart and do a bypass amen but God is a Creator and God goes right to the original artery and God clears out that artery and God makes a way amen for the blood to flow through that artery again I believe another word for unclogging is Revival and you know what the prophet said the Revival was he said is to wash out all the trash and unbelief amen and let the people come out and see that God is still God how many says I want to see him tonight I want to see him in the morning I want to see him tomorrow night I want to see every second of this Camp I want to see that God is still God and His word is still true amen I believe the Bible says I am the Lord and I change not then if he does not change that means if will clean out the channels of our hearts we can see him now can I just say this to you amen if you're waiting on the channel of God to get open it's already open well brother Andrew I'm praying and waiting for God's Channel listen God's channel is not clogged come on God's channel is not clogged the prophet said I believe amen that the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can look at it in the right way he said remember here's my standard in life the first first thing I want to find out whether it's the will of God or not then I know it's God's will the next thing is my objective and my motive in doing it then it's the will of God my objective is right my motive is right then I can have the faith it'll be done because first it's the will of God and my objective is to glorify him and my motive is to give him all the glory so there's no selfish motives about it if you have a selfish motive it will not work but if your objective is to he says to make money for yourself or something you'll never succeed he said anything outside the will of the Lord it will not work so there is a genuine Faith amen but you must come into the channel of God to have the genuine Faith he said there's human faith and there's the faith of God and you must have a Godly Faith to believe now to have a Godly Faith you must have the mind of Christ in you then that's how God projects to you Visions Revelations and all these things amen they come by the mind of Christ amen being in you amen are you hearing me then the Bible said let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be also in you do you know we will never find the channel of God without the mind of God but Paul said these beautiful words he said we have the mind of Christ Church we're not looking for it we're not waiting for it we're not praying for it we have the mind of Christ here is the secret the word is in the bride as it was in Mary and the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he want done with his word amen and she performs amen the command of the word of the Lord in Genesis chapter 4 we can find a man named Cain and a man named Abel trying to find the channel of God brother said by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice in Cain he said now watch Cain was just as religious as Abel was he said they both build altars they both love God they both made sacrifices they both paid their tithe they both worshiped they both done everything like amen but Able by faith which is the Revelation the word of God revealed made plain showed out and Vindicated wo that's a mouthful the word of God made plain revealed showed out and Vindicated he said and the true Channel amen now watch God interprets his own word by its terms he spoke it in now watch Cain said I'm religious I'm a lover of the maker I love this fine altar I love the sacrifice Lord I just love you and Abel said the same thing amen but now it's the one that's vend ated and the one that's proven now watch this and God come down and received Abel's sacrifice because by Revelation he had struck the true channel of God Amen that was accepted so Cain was trying to work his way in that channel amen but Abel by Faith by Revelation by the word made plain Vindicated he accepted the Revelation that had been sent to him and by accepting the Revelation he unlocked the channel of Praise or unlocked the T of forgiveness amen and it was not through the melons and the pumpkins and the apples or whatever was there amen it was through the blood now come on church amen do you realize there's 900 denominations and they're working themselves to death amen trying to unlock the power to forgive sin trying to unlock the power to keep a Revival in the church trying to unlock the power to get young people to show up more than just at a special event amen but here you sit tonight and we're not trying to work it up we're not trying to buy it up amen but God is in a message in this hour and I'll say this with everything within Me by the message of the hour amen we have reopened the channel of Revelation to the church that had been clogged up by Theology and man-made theories that channel has been open brother Larry there's a revelation and it's flowing in the house of God and if Revelation ever drops in the channel of the heart of the believer the devil is finished the day of sin is over oh God hallelujah I'm I know it's a first night but it ain't the first meeting we've ever been in amen the channel is open tonight the Revelation is Flowing you ain't got to wait till Saturday night you ain't got to wait till Sunday morning you ain't got to wait till tomorrow night amen but right here right now this message has unlocked a flow of Revelation in this meeting and if you can let that Revelation drop into your heart it's over it's over the devil is defeated sin is finished is that sister Ella God bless you Sister Ella it's good to see you amen God opened the channel amen of the prophetic gift in this generation amen by the Fulfillment and the interpretation of his word when he placed me in this channel of this prophetic gift amen whatever it might be I do not know but the Bible is open here before me I do not know just what to call it he said but it's a prophetic gift and when he places it upon me I try to glorify our heavenly father he said now watch whatever I can to help his people that's what I do then do you realize a prophet was standing with a prophetic gift to the bride of Christ who I believe you're a part of that had a pro is a prophetic class of people who has a prophetic womb to bring forth prophetic promises but if the channel of prophetic has been shut off then that Revelation cannot flow but if that channel is open and that Revelation begins to flow it can flow right into this building tonight and you can realize I'm not just a citizen I'm not just a young girl I'm not just a young boy I am a part of the Eternal purpose of almighty God and my name is in the Lamb's Book of Life listen devil if you was going to get me you should have got me when you could if the devil was going to get you he should have got you when he could Elijah if the devil was going to get you he should have got you when he could amen but the Devil Couldn't get you amen because there's a force over your life and the force that's over your life is the force of a prophecy and my Bible says that heavens and earth will pass away but the prophecy of the word amen will never fail then I'm preaching to a young person tonight that no matter what comes no matter what goes you will not back up you will not give in you will not turn around you will not lay down you will not quit you will pursue that devil because you are a prophetic class of people with a prophetic gift with a prophetic message with a prophetic anointing the for of Prophecy is over your life come on church when we recognize the time that we're living in what a powerful Covenant we are under it should move the church into action come on it should move the church into action you say preacher I'm waiting on the music to get right the music ain't this bride's Revival come on just let me preach well brother and I'm waiting till they sing my favorite song your favorite song is not the brid's Revival the brid's Revival is a word Revival that's why why that the Revival Burns no matter where it's at because it's not built on a man it's not built on a church it's not built on a man's gift it's not built on a man's personality this revival has been built on thus sayith the Lord and you are a prophetic class of people who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final Age come on Church Paul's not coming back brother brandom's not coming back but you're here and you got a voice and you got a heart and there's an anointing upon [Music] you well I might as well just say what Paul said he said we have obtained a more excellent Ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better Covenant which was established upon on better promises he is the mediator of a better Covenant which Brother David is established upon better promises you know what the prophet said he said now Miriam and them looking back they saw that separation they saw their their enemies annihilated forever how long was they going to be safe from them these Egyptians that you see today you will see no more forever he said amen put them in the sea of forgetfulness and remember them no more that's the kind of God we have he does not go and dig it up again and hold it against you oh I'm in a Channel right now it's a Channel of condemnation amen some of you all right now your channel of faith is clogged with condemnation it's clogged with I've been I've done I've seen I've said amen but how many can believe that this is more than a sermon this is more than just a message amen but this is a prophetic word it's a part of a better Covenant that is established upon better promises and the prophet said then if you can believe that God does not hold it against you here's what God says I forgot about it some of y'all right now are reminding God of things he forgot about and while you're trying to remind God I feel like preaching right now while you're trying to remind God of what you done what you said what you thought what you looked at places you went God is looking at you and saying you could be saying amen you could be receiving Revelation you could be enjoying the anointing amen I don't know what you're talking about well come on Church brother Jesse if God forgot it then I think it's time we forget it if God put it in the sea of forgetfulness I think it's time we say God I Repent of the thing it's in the sea of forgetfulness Brother Joseph it's forgotten it's not against you it's not remembered but I'll tell you what my Bible says if God be for you if God be for you then who can be against you what sin can be against you what negative thing can be against you what Li from the pits of hell can be against you if God is for you then what devil can be against you he's in the sea of forgetfulness I just got to say what the prophet said he said said no wonder Mariam had a hot spell woo brother no wonder Mariam had a hot spell and she picked up a tambourine and began to dance and jump up down on the bank you know the Holy Spirit just look like it just catches from one to another like Adams in a relay it begin to jump from one to another they all got tambourines and just had a real Jubilee and old brother Moses got so happy that he held up his hands and he's sing in the spirit if that ain't a Holy Roller meetting I never seen one if that ain't a Holy Roller meat and I never seen one he said that's something new no it's nothing new it's just a new tapped with the old it's just a new that is tapped in to the old he said there they was singing in the spirit amen dancing in the spirit beating all the music clapping their hands what a time they was having now listen to The Prophet why they was annihilated from their enemy but listen he still does the same thing well Glory what he did for Miriam he still does today under a better Covenant way better than the old Covenant brother Thomas if David rather Moses and Miriam could dance at the fact they're devils and their enemies were dead come on church amen I tell you what I believe they were dancing for I don't believe they was dancing because the tambourine I don't believe they were dancing amen because of the music I believe they were dancing because they was a part of a prophetic class of people and they received the Revelation in their hearts that that Taskmaster you see you'll see no more that devil that's taught you will fight you no more listen church that was under the bud of bulls and goats but you're not under the blood of bulls and goats where your sin is just covered you're under the blood of Jesus Christ where your sin is divorc it's in the sea of forgetfulness if anybody got a righteous shout the Bride of Jesus Christ has got to right if anybody got a right to Rejoice that our sins are over our iniquities he will remember no more and they are under the blood oh I just got to say what he said he forgiveth all thine iniquities and health all thy diseases you know what he said in the Old Testament they had one prescription under the old Covenant I am the Lord that Health all by diseases he said but we have six have some 600 or more better promises on Divine Healing brother Matt they got happy on one and we got 600 or more better promises well we just might as well preach it's Thursday night we got 600 more better promises and we come in here looking like the devil's our is our best friend and if it wasn't for bad luck we wouldn't have none at all listen friends I'm just going to gohe and preach since I'm here I think we ought to get back to enjoying the message I think we ought to get back to enjoying the word of God I think we ought to get back to a place where we don't let quotes become C we don't let things just become another service or another Camp I think we ought to get back to a place we realize who we are in the word of God and we're not here under the old Covenant we're here under the new brother said if they did that under that Covenant how much greater is the Covenant today he said you know what I begin to Believe Christian friend that we're just living in the beginning of the greatest time this world has ever witnessed I just believe that all the lines are getting unclogged I just be come on church amen this was all the way back in 1955 amen that a prophet announced that the lines were becoming uncared do you realize that was before the Seven Seals that was before the seven Church ages that was before the third pool that was be come now I'm just going to go ahead and say it you say brother Andrew this is a youth camp don't you venture out in the message well listen I'm talking to people that can build computers they can build websites if you can build a computer and build a program you can understand this message I refuse to let that devil clog up the channel of Revelation in this generation you're not a bunch of babies you're not a bunch of babies just got to be patted all the time I Believe come on church I'm preaching to kids that's been through things brother sister you should have never been through but you're here tonight you faced Devils you should have never faced but you faced them and you overcome them and you're here tonight in the house of God with an amen in your heart with a Hallelujah in your soul come on we're not about of babies I believe we've climbed up the pyramid I believe we're adopted Sons and Daughters of God this adoption is not in the future it's right here right now you are right now the Sons and Daughters of God not tomorrow not next week not next Youth Camp right now you are the sons and daughters of God in position by the message of the hour I don't believe you're coming into Power I believe you're in power I believe the lines are all unclogged he said I just believe all the lines are getting unclogged you know they've been clogged up with all kinds of doctrines and theologies and all kinds of stuff and unbelief now now if I can have some Liberty here I'm going to labor for a second he said that's been handed down from generation to generation so actually you have got clogged up clogged up channels that actually was clogged up because something was passed down to you was passed down to you from another generation so from one generation it come into another generation and because that generation didn't deal with it it come over in the next generation and because come on church and because that generation are you hearing me amen things have been piled up now I just might as well preach since I'm here amen I tell you what happens amen things don't get buried and they get passed they don't get buried and they get passed like one time I I probably probably told this before but I'm going to say it again I was at a church one time two young men standing there talking to me brother Jason they were telling me about a fight in the church that happened I well they told me about it like they was a part of it and when they got done I said when did that happen brother looked at me brother looked at me he said oh I think that was about 25 years ago when that happened to my grandfather well I'm here I might as well plow through it I said 25 years ago something happened and 25 years later ler that thing is still living in the Next Generation when it should have never left that generation somebody should have found an altar somewhere and confessed that thing and killed it come on church I think it's time to put some devils in the grave I think it's time to bury some ill feelings I think it's time to put some devils in their place you are not the recipient of complexes and church problems and so and so Bel so and so and this happened amen come on church it's a new generation I think we ought to bury the hatchet I think we ought to bury the axe I think we ought to grow up and be young men and women and say that was a generation ago I will not be a carrier for what happened 20 years ago I tell you what we ought to be carrying we ought to be carrying testimonies we ought to be carrying victories we ought to let the past be the past now you all know I'm preaching let the past be the past and then you know what happens Amen brother Jordan something will happen 20 years ago and that'll come down and then that person who was not a part of it will begin to treat somebody wrong because they think they well I don't know I'm here are you hearing me and it just keeps passing down and passing down and passing down well come on Church what are you all going to grow up and marry and pass down to your kids a bunch of problems and a bunch of so and so don't believe this and so and so don't believe that and brother so and so teaches this and Brother come on church I think we ought to bury this them Devils tonight and realize we got a future and the devil's not in it we got a future and fear is not in it we got a future and division is not in it we got a future amen and complexes is not in it but I'll tell you what is in it the Rapture is in it and the body Chang is in it and healing is in it and miracles is in it and victory is in it and power is in it and anointing is in it and holy ghost power and freedom is in your future I say tonight Church bury the past and don't pass it down another generation now I'm here one generation dealt with it so I guess I got two that devil will not clog your channels I might as well just say it CU some of y'all sitting there thinking time's going to change that devil well let me just say it like this you take a young man that don't think church is important and he gets married and he thinks marriage is going to change it no he'll just make marriage he'll take marriage and make church more unimportant so instead of him not going now his wife and him ain't going and then he'll think well we'll get kids and when kids come along we'll change it amen but then kids come along and now you got a whole family at the beach on Sunday and the house of God sitting empty and that devil was right here in this meeting because you didn't think church was important come on church amen some of y'all hell God are you hearing me amen sit there and stare at your pastor like he's got three heads and disrespect the ministry disrespect the pastor and then think marriage is going to change it listen marriage will not change that devil the only thing that's going to change that devil is that channel gets unclogged and you get an oldfashioned refreshing from the presence of God and you can love everybody you can forgive everybody you can enjoy the blessings of God it's got to stop some somewhere I said it's got to stop somewhere come on church amen some of you all are plagued with nervousness and you think well when I get married amen marriage is going to fix it no you'll just take a wife into nervousness I I'm off my notes but I'm here and I've got quotes for it the prophet said let one person in the house get nervous and the whole house gets nervous he said let one person get anxiety and the whole house gets it he said but let one person begin to rejoice and it can move to the entire house I say oh God put a hand of faith in every believer here this weekend that we can learn how to fight that devil as skilled soldiers it's got to stop somewhere come on I know a been line history in your generation come right down upon you and you fight the same old line devil couldn't tell the truth if your life depend but somewhere it's got to stop come on I'm not backing off that devil I've got him real uncomfortable right now and I'm going to keep him that way till we kill him come on young man amen a lust devil right now well marriage will fix it listen you take a marriage with a lust devil if that marriage is oh God if that marriage is built on lust it's only a matter of time before that marriage becomes another statistic and you become another case where there should have been a Deliverance come on I'm just going to preach to you I don't believe we ought to subject our marriages to Leonia to be fixed I believe right here in the house of God is a good place to change the future of a future husband or a future woman I believe there's power in the message of the hour Amen to change a man's nature to change a woman's nature and put him in position to be a real woman to be a real man of God time does not change Spirits brother Matt time mature Spirits so you take an 18yar old boy bad on lust put him in a nursery home and 80 years old he'll still be fting with the nurses cuz time didn't change it it only matured it but somewhere it's got to stop somewhere it's got to die somewhere it's got to end well why not this be the night say devil this is the last day I'm going to carry lust this is the last day I'm going to carry anxiety this is the last day I'm going to carry things from Generations before me I believe tonight T not to unclog the channels and let all the past be the past I do not want to leave this Camp reformed I want to leave [Music] transformed now are you saying brother Andrew you're getting out there am I really am I really the devil loves to clog up these channels he loves to clog now right now what he's trying to do is he's trying to clog up the channel of inspiration because inspiration is where things begin to change under inspiration is where things begin to change under the inspiration is where lies begin to be changed listen what the Bible said the Bible said there is a spirit in man and it's the inspiration of the almighty that giveth him the understanding do you see what's happening in your services is your pastors are not hooked up to your phones they're not tapped into your bedrooms they're not tapped into your schools amen they're working for the spirit of inspiration and there's a spirit trying to destroy you and so that man of God gets along somewhere with God and finds the mind of God and comes into the pull pit and then that Spirit begins to cry out I need help I need help they're getting ready to get free they're getting ready to get delivered you know what it is it's a devil trying to get reinforcement Amen to stop what God is pouring in the church but the prophet said this he said listen he said when you know you've done exactly what God told you to do see then wait for that channel of inspiration to open up to you and then you'll say now I'm Healed when it drops in there then it's all over he said now watch you don't need no prayer lines nothing else it's over see it's been revealed to you now watch this now when it's revealed to you that you yourself has received oh God has received God's promise the inspiration you being Christians it struck you he said you don't even need a prayer line now we all believe in prayer lines right but we believe in them but the prop said the only thing you need is an open heart when all the mechanics are ready then let the inspiration drop in then nothing can change your mind you've got it outside of that it would do no good when a man is INSP are you hearing me when the mechanics are in line and the inspiration begins to pour upon the mechanics which is the Dynamics begins to pour upon the mechanics there's nothing that devil can do to change your mind see that's why it's got to move Beyond flesh it's got to move Beyond spirit it's got to move Beyond when I went to camp and I got in the atmosphere and I really felt like I got a freedom amen listen that that freedom Freedom has got to go from your feet it's got to go from your hands it's got to go into your soul and when that Revelation drops oh my church when that Revelation drops in your soul there's nothing the devil can do to change your mind oh I'm preaching to you when the Revelation gets in your soul the devil can do nothing to change your mind y'all know I'm preaching to you cuz we've all been there we went to camp we got delivered we felt good we went home and the devil said you didn't get nothing the devil said you didn't feel nothing you went and saw your old friends and found yourself back in that shape do you know why that is is because the prophet said amen it just got on the outside it didn't get on the inside but if it gets on the inside come on if it gets on the inside then you can go back to all your old friends and they don't have enough mental power Amen to put you under a pressure Amen to go back to the things that you've been delivered from are you hearing me when it I think brother Paul of fontain wrote a song when it drops from your head into your heart when it drops from your head into your heart and becomes a revelation are you hearing me when it becomes a revelation then it's not an emotion I'm free it's not a feeling I'm free it's a revelation I'm free then you know what'll happen the emotion as much as we love it will leave you but the Revelation never will The Sensation will leave you Amen brother amen but the but the revelation will be there when you feel like everything's against you now I'll just say to you like this cuz I'm hurrying along here the probably God said in the Old Testament I I pray this okay he said in the Old Testament he said what happened was he said the war he said in war they had tactics he said what those tactics was was the enemy would come in and would stomp up the water channels now watch if the enemy could just cut off the water supply then the people would die in Genesis 26:17 the Bible says Isaac departed then and pitched his tent in the valley of gerer and dwelt there now watch this and Isaac digged again the wells of water somebody say water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father so Isaac was not digging New Wales come on brother Jason Isaac was not digging new whales the whales were already dug but they had gotten clogged up somewhere but okay from one generation to the next somewhere from Abraham to Isaac the whales had gotten clogged up and they had to be redu and the Bible says the Philistines had stopped them amen after the death of Abraham and he called their names after by which their father had called them now watch Isaac's servants digged in the valley and found there a whale of springing water did you all catch that they found a whale of springing water and the Hersman of gerer did strive with Isaac's hergan saying the water is ours and he called the name of the Welly SEC with both they strove with him and they digged another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitna and he removed from fence and digged another wh and for that they strove not and he called the name of it reoboth and he said for now the Lord hath made room for us all and we shall be fruitful in the land brother said now I'm the public utility he said if you don't pay the bill they'll cut off the water you'll dry up around the house he said and that's what's the matter with God's people tonight they just didn't pay the price God cut their water off see go to any Desert you want to that's the reason some of you Full Gospel Church members and so forth amen don't believe in Divine Healing is because your water has been cut off that's right and when there's no water it gets stickers where there's water watch this where there's water that same plant will soften up amen and make Leaves amen that same plant will soften up and make leaves so they found out they was without water and when you're without water amen you're without life when you're without water you're without life are you hearing me when you're without water amen you're without life amen the prod God said here amen amen hurrying here he said now here many people say well if I only had faith and what you're saying is if I only had Faith to open up the channels he said but Faith does not mean long drawn out prayer meetings it doesn't mean long fast faith is unconscious you're real Faith you're unconscious of it you don't know you've got the faith yeah it's an unconscious matter within you he said could you imagine Jesus questioning whether he had Faith or not to stop the winds or steal the waves or have faith enough to raise Lazarus he never question his faith now listen we must allow the holy spirit amen to unclog the channel of Faith amen I'm just going to share this to you I was driving down the road early this morning just praying and the Lord just spoke these words to my heart and I'm just going to say it this this is just prayer the spirit of the Lord said we got to unclog the channel of faith and clog the channel of doubt we got to unclog the channel of faith and clog the channel of Doubt do you realize the matter that has accumulated in your channel of faith is what you need to accumulate in your channel of Doubt are you hearing me the questions about the message that have accumulated in your channel of Faith needs to be unclogged and accumulated in the channel of doubt I tell you why Satan loves to clog the channel amen he he loves to clog the channel of our purpose amen with our failures but according to Ephesians 311 the purpose of God is an eternal purpose and I say this the purpose of God is irresistible it is sure of fulfillment it is seen in his choice of instruments it is revealed in the gospel it is eternal in Christ and it involves the overthrow of Satan oh God Church Living God Amen the devil right here right now is trying to clog your channel of purpose well brother Andrew said to get rid of the generation and brother Andrew preached this but listen it's not for you because you don't have a purpose well you just sit there and watch me I'm going to go after that devil for a second every single one of you all have got a purpose come on church quit letting the devil tell you you're an accident you're a mistake you shouldn't be here you shouldn't be in this Camp amen why don't you goad and put that devil under your foot right now and say God has a purpose for my life he has a purpose for me being here he has a purpose come on he has a purpose in these meetings he has a purpose in this ministry he has a purpose in this Camp amen and the Eternal purpose of God will not be defeated but we will defeat the Devil who's trying to defeat the purpose of God we were created for the purpose to control and to rule and to praise God and to live for god listen church when God made you he made you with an eternal purpose brother said it like this he refers to Genesis 1 and he said man was made Superior to everything on the earth amen man was made a secondary amen God on the earth that was Adam now listen what a prophet said he said now what's in man he's yet a Son of God no matter oh my can I labor here for a second he's a Son of God no matter what state he's in no matter how sinful he is how far away he is he's a fallen son but yet he's a son and God is his creation t god is his maker God has bought him with a prize he may never reconcile himself to that he may never accept it it may never do him any good but yet he and she is a daughter of God he said then what did God put man here for I'm closing on these points what did God put man here for he said when God made man in the beginning he made him Superior to anything on the earth he gave him jurisdiction over everything on Earth to control everything he controlled the animal life life he controlled the foul life he controlled the fishes of the sea he controlled the winds the plant life he controlled everything he said but the free moral agency amen was the power by which man failed listen Church man was made as a secondary God on Earth he was given the power Amen to control all things all elements of the earth that was Adam and Adam was given these great Powers but then the power that he was given to make himself is where he failed can I say it to you like this I'm going to B something from brother Donnie Reagan he says our free moral agency has caused us more trouble than we ever realize Adam could speak to the winds and stop them he could speak to the trees and they would obey he could speak to Wildlife it would obey he could speak to the waters everything he said now are you ready for this church he said through the fall he lost that power then he become unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friend ship and fellowship with the father he lost that and all of his great channels become cogged up and he couldn't get through he said now what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that now a redeemer is to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again come on church it's time on a Thursday night to go back to the beginning it's time to go back to the old Landmark it's time to go back to Genesis 1 where you were not inferior and the devil was superior but it's time to go back to where you was Superior and every devil was inferior listen Church Satan knows tonight he knows that he will never defeat God somebody say Satan knows Satan knows he will never defeat God so he's oh god brother Matt he knows he will never defeat God so he's always attacking the closest thing to God he knows he'll never defeat God he knows he'll never defeat the bridegroom brother Barry so what does he do he constantly attacks the closest thing to God and the closest thing to God Is His Bride come on church so because the devil knows he'll never defeat God he's trying to defeat you but I just want to put hell on notice tonight he will never defeat the bridegroom and he will never defeat the bride he can shoot he can throw he can kick he can holler but there is an anointing that has been released in this generation in other words in other words in the closest thing to God he says all of the plumbing as it was in our brain and the outlets the faith has been clogged up with business affair with home life with domestic things it's become so clogged up until God cannot operate through those channels that he made a man for if God designed man's body he certainly designed the body of his son the church and he's designed us to come together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and have the supernatural workings of God Outlets through gifts of the Spirit such as prophecy wisdom knowledge gifts healing and not as an individual so much but us as a unit we're all together one great body of people the Bible said we have spooled the principalities and Powers brother B said watch you know what that word spool the word spool means disarmed brother said this is the confidence we have in God that we got what we asked for for he's God and he cannot take back his word he's got to stay with that word we was made for that purpose and the only thing that hindered the human race today from being Superior controlling like they did in the beginning is because the power lines of the lines of the outlet of God made in the human being has been clogged up now I just got to say what the prophet said he said the Oles cloged those lines up he said how much more then could the power of God the Holy Ghost once passing through the human heart by faith what would what could it do he said look what the Holy Spirit has promised to Believers today he said now if God could ever just clear that little Channel out I'm I'm I'm closing on this point if God could ever just clear that little Channel out and run energy out to that place then something's going to happen listen I've been in youth camps before as a camper I've seen the Holy Ghost move in a meeting change a life bring that change life back to a dorm and change another life I've literally seen that you know why oh my I'm out of time you know why because the five-fold ministry can I say it this way is electricians they're wiring the spiritual building of the body and the prophet of God said if properly taught in every fiber of our body being Lost In Christ to his word he said if you got all the theology got some Doctrine got some Superstition got some unbelief got something that stops up somewhere then the energy can ever pull through you but when you get to a place where you're perfectly wired and the master electrician has okay it by sealing it with the Holy Spirit the only thing is just turn on the switch then there'll be a light show that's right somebody say these words with me make this Valley full of ditches listen Church the water is here as our musicians are coming the water is here in the book of Kings the Bible says he saw he saw a vision y'all y'all familiar with it he said bring a Minstrel and he came and and when a Minstrel played the hand of the Lord came upon him and he said thus saith the Lord make this Valley full of ditches now watch this for thus saith the Lord ye shall not see wind neither shall you see rain yet the valley shall be filled with water that ye may drink both ye your cattle and your beast and this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord but he will deliver the moabites also into your hand and you shall Smite every fence City every choice City and shall fail every good tree and stop all Wells of water and Mar every good piece of land with stones so the enemy clogged up their channels when they unclogged those channels they took what they unclogged in their channels through them in the enemy's channels threw them in the enemy's channels and Clogg the enemy's channels brother Pro of God said I saw a vision I see the way out he said I tell you brother today the church hasn't got the vision they' have more prayer they'd be more spiritual than what they are he said now watch when he's seen how the way out listen are you hearing me the vision was the way out I'm preaching to you the vision of the prophetic message it's the way out it's the way you're going to get out now he said the first thing I want you to do is go out here and make this Valley full of ditches just as hard as you can dig for thus sayith the Lord you'll not see any wind any rain but the valley be full of water more ditches the more water he said what did he see he saw a vision of that spirit rock that Moses had already smitten and been speaking to so he just spoke to that rock and it was ready to pour forth the water when ditches was made for it to run in when ditches was made for that water to run in the only thing they were waiting on was somebody to start digging brother Andrew you're going real slow right now I am CZ I've preached you the vision the water's here the rain is here the refreshing is here brother John the Deliverance is here the miracle is here now here's your shovel get today get to digging dig out that ditch dig out that ditch of fear dig out that come on get the fear out of the ditch get the complex out of the ditch get the generational curse out of the ditch get the they don't like me they don't care for me get it out of the ditch Church the rain is here but the ditch has got to be open for the rain to fall in come on Isaac amen the whale was there when your father Abraham was there but somewhere something's got in there but if you can just start digging oh Church of the Living God I feel like shouting right now cuz there's some people digging right now and by Revelation I see the rain clouds I see the rain of healing I see the rain of Victory I see the rign of anointing I see the reign of Liberty I see the reign of freedom I see the reain of forgiveness I see the joy of the Lord upon the church come on some of you young people get to digging come come on counselers don't get mad at me amen but you're counselers maybe you need to dig come on you're not just taking up a bed and paying a camp fee but you're a channeling this Camp as well you're a channeling this Camp as well and if there's a something in your ditch and can't no water get in there can't no water get in that dorm but if you can let the thing go and break out by faith won you stand to your feet with us tonight that's what we got to do tonight can I say what a prophet said he said the smitten Rock tonight is here brother Paul the same rock that Moses spoke to years ago and water come out of it brother Noah it's right here yes sir in this building tonight now listen I know I know the devil's put a bad name on digging but I believe in digging I believe in digging things out I believe when you come up against a wall and you realize there ain't no water falling there ain't no anointing there ain't no Spirit there ain't no joy church is just a ritual fear has become your guide what people say about you is become your limitations what somebody thinks about you is become the way you live I'm preaching to you right now tell you what I believe I believe when that happens it's time to get to digging don't get mad at me please don't but I'm afraid some of us have got to shout more than we got to digging don't get mad at me cuz you know I love shouting and dancing as much as anybody in the world but the prophet of God said you ain't going to stomp this devil out he said you got to dig this devil out he said the way you dig is you repent what has happened to the ability to say I'm wrong we live in a generation where nobody's wrong everybody's right so that spirit is coming right in the message and nobody's wrong everybody's right it's his fault his fault his fault somebody else's fault it's not mine if [Music] some and you know what you're doing you're sitting there spiritually dying blaming this person and blaming that person but I'm just going to tell you what the prophet said he said the deeper you dig the more water you get no matter how much preaching there is how many Visions there are the subject was then and the main principle was make ready for the water get the ditches dug he said that's the way you got to do tonight is make way for the Holy Ghost to pour down make it in your house make it in your church make it in yourself kick everything out of the way and get ready there's coming a gusher brother Jason can I say these words over this Camp there's coming a gusher if you'll get ready for it if you'll make ready for it if you don't do it you'll never see it now it's up to the church tonight you got a nice tent here got nice peed churches seats got nice people got nice singing We got a wonderful savior listen can I say this you're sitting on a beautiful Campground beautiful buildings but lay aside everything every sin that easily besets you brother random I don't do nothing maybe that's what's the matter then the trouble of it is it's more sin not to do than it is to do when you know better Church the spirit's message tonight is dig or perish dig or perish I believe there's young people tonight to can dig out them ditches and Shout about the victories for the next few days hallelujah brother Levi I really believe right here in this meeting tonight ditches are getting opened channels are becoming unclogged I want you bow your hearts with us tonight you know that song pour your spirit out on me pour your spirit out on me ever head bowed ever eye closed I'm just going to deliver to you what's burning in my heart tonight dig or die dig

young people should never have to go through you faced situations been through problems that young people should never have to experience but whatever you went through wasn't strong enough to kill you cuz you're still here tonight but maybe the devil's trying to take that log and throw it in your channel and you can't forgive Mama can't forgive daddy can't let this go can't forgive the preacher can't forgive this person listen Church dig tonight or perish ever head bowed ever eye closed on the first night of this Youth Camp would there be one could raise your hand and say brother Andrew I

that when man fa that his the channels in his brain become clogged and Lord he forgot that he was Superior and not inferior he Lord he forg God he had dominion over the foul of the air the fish of the sea the Trees of the Earth he forgot those things Lord and father what caused that was some channels in his in his brain got clogged Lord is I was just talking to a brother the other day and he was sharing with me how that all of a sudden he just one day woke up and he forgot how to do this he forgot how to start his truck he forgot how to get this place he forgot how to do this at his house they rushed him to the hospital they took him in there and run a scan and they showed there was something in his in his in his brain there was an artery clogged and it was cutting off a part of blood fo to his brain and all these things was going on they had to do emergency surgery and Lord As you stood there and testified to me he said when they did that surgery just a few days when that artery got open he said I began to remember how to start my truck I begin to remember how to do things around my house I remember how to get places Lord I couldn't help but think of your prophet in the message spiritual Amnesia Lord father when that Soldier was coming home and Lord he had forgot about how to get home he forgot who he was he forgot where he come from but Lord when they got him off that train and he be to walk around and he begin to see the old landmarks his memory begin to come back to him he crossed the hill I love as the prophet said it he said there said his old daddy looking across the hill and he began to see his son coming and he took off to him and his daddy said I never believed it when they told me you wouldn't come home Lord that Daddy knew that if his mind if that channel become unclogged he could remember who he was he could remember where he come from Satan I speak to you tonight in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ thou demon of matter and accumulation in the arteries of the spiritual heart and brain of these Believers I adure Thee in the name of Jesus Christ thou demon that tries to clog their channels and clog their arteries and cause them to
