[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the lord greece in the name of the lord this morning happy to have you streaming the sunday school class we're just going to continue with it as a streaming only service for the next little while watching the current situation with kovid it's what i feel that's going to be necessary uh at least for a little while longer so to those of you who may be enroute for the main service and streaming in the car hope the audio link is working good for you for those streaming at home trust all things are working well i have everything should be good good deal good good from the indication from the booth so we want to continue our study today in the book of revelation we're going to be i've i've put out three verses i'd like to cover today verse eight nine and ten we'll read it from verse one revelation chapter 1. the revelation of jesus christ excuse me which god gave to him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen now if you remember in our last time i believe which would have i think today did i say today was part eight i believe i sent yes thanks sir in part 7 we announced that we were kind of changing up a little bit doing more of an overview study we're going to do a much more thorough exhaustive study in the podcast which we do not have available yet uh that's still um coming but we're we have all things pretty much ready we're just waiting on one or two final pieces to move forward with that so i we want to look today as you'll remember when we finished up with verse 7 we found him coming with clouds and every eye shall see him now it's it's interesting that you have in this verse every eye seeing him so i think that we can certainly correlate as we were saying last time that this is at the end of the tribulation because we find in first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 2 that he comes as a thief in the night jesus also makes reference to this in the gospels i don't want to backtrack too far into last portion but we find that that for the rapture of the bride he appears in the air now here's an interesting contrast that i didn't cover last time if you think about it it's a very fair question to say so why do we see him in the air but in revelation but the world doesn't but in revelation 19 all the world does see him and the answer of course is actually pretty self-evident that when he comes in the air he's coming as the bridegroom as the groom of the bride therefore only the bride sees him but in revelation 19 he's coming as the judge and we realize that all humanity will see him and wail because of him because that they realize they've missed his first uh rapture coming they didn't see him because as we said he the dead in christ rise first and then we which are alive and remain are caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air now of course we are we know that if the pattern and we believe it will if the pattern follows the way it did in the gospels that there was a resurrection and then um there were they were seen of many and uh not all the graves were opened in the in the gospel days in the in the days when jesus rose from the grave but brother branham said it was those who died in the faith of abraham the true israelites because not all israel is israel just like all people who claim to be christians are not christians and so we realize that you have to come god's provided way and there's many that try to come some other way and they are rejected and cast in to the tribulation jesus you'll remember gives this parable of finding someone trying to come into the wedding supper but he did not have the garments and we realize that we are dressed in the garments of the word this was brother branham's great feeling in his heart that he was going to be privileged to dress the bride and the garments of the word so we see him in the air because we're the bride the world doesn't see him but in revelation 19 when he comes back as the judge every eye shall see him now we move quickly into verse 8 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is which was which is to come so here again another reference again you're going to see that reference often because it's just prophet priest and king and so he comes in various forms that which was that which is that which was and that which is to come that which is is in the form of priest that which was was in the form of son of man prophet and that which is to come he's the king the son of david so that which is which was and which is to come it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever this is how the true bride always identifies him now it's interesting because he emphasizes to john john who is a representative of the bride of christ brother branham taught us that and the revelation of jesus christ series i i have that in a note further on down we won't get to it today but he said that john represented the uh the blood he represented the blood-washed saints of god all right so he taught that very clearly now i am alpha and omega and we realize that brother branham points out in numerous places i'll give you two references in 1958 um in the baptism of the holy spirit he makes the reference also in 1964 in the masterpiece brother branham comments on this again that he's alpha and omega because he's he's the beginning and he's the end but he's not the in between now you have to watch that because there's also places where brother branham says and we say it commonly he's the a to z the alpha the omega and everything in the middle and brother branham makes that analogy also based on the fact that jesus is walking in the midst of seven lamp stands he is in the midst of his church he said i will never leave you nor forsake you but the emphasis so it's not a denial that christ is walking in his church down through the ages christ was with them all the way but what we find is what the scripture is saying that brother branham is illustrating is that in the alpha he was purely him and the omega it returns to purely him the word and completely the pure word but in the middle while he was in the in between not everything in the in between was him and that's how you look at i'll say it again he was in the in between but not everything in the in between was him because we find that mankind had injected all kinds of doctrines and dogmas i think i've got enough time to read these two quotes for you because that might be a struggle in some people's mind remember this is 1958 the baptism of the holy spirit remember as jesus was seen in the cross standing in the seven golden candlesticks the darkest was what was the furthest away from him his right hand and his left hand so now the illustration brother branham is giving is christ is standing if you if you've ever seen the hebrew menorah he's standing with his arm stretched and he's the alpha and he's the omega but but you'll notice that it's he's the closest with his hand to the alpha and the closest with his hand to the omega all the ages in between are further away from his purity you get that illustration so he says the darkest was what the furthest away from him his right hand and his left hand and he was to look upon as alpha and omega not the in between the alpha he repeats it the alpha and omega as he had his hand stretched he was jasper and sardone stone and we find that that's the perfect alpha and omega birthstones from ephraim to benjamin which was benjamin and i mean benjamin and reuben the first and the last there he had his hands stretched there he stood he says it again in the masterpiece 1964 the alpha and omega is the same he said i am alpha and omega he never said anything in between i am alpha and omega the first and the last so in our sunday school lesson here this morning when we look at verse 8 he's saying i am alpha and omega to not add to the scripture but under a prophetic authority we can show you that what he's indicating is that in the alpha he's fully perfect in the omega he's fully perfect and while he is in the midst of the seven lamp stands he is in the in between but everything in the in between is not fully him because men have added their own understanding to it all right i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending the first and the last there's a lot that i could begin to break down here but we're going to try to keep moving all right so we come now to the verse 9. as we said we're only doing an overview during our sunday school class we'll make a much deeper i'm skipping tons and tons and tons of notes that we will cover on the podcast um verse 9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ i was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ now we know that the book of revelation teaches us that the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy so we realize that that that going forward into the ages he's saying i'm going to be with you and and john is saying i am your companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ so john under the anointing of the spirit is letting us understand that if you're going to be in the kingdom of christ down no matter what age that you are going to go through you're going to you're going to have to expect tribulation and you're going to have to have the patience of jesus christ and so we realize that john who was caught up in the spirit we'll catch that in our next verse and was translated all the way to the lord's day was able under the anointing of that revelation given to john by jesus christ that john was able now to give a message to all the ages you're going to be the kingdom the kingdom is within you you're going to be the temple of the holy ghost you're going to be the living representatives of god in the earth and therefore i'm going to be your companion and you're going to be my companion just as we have been under tribulation you are going to be under tribulation you're going to be hated and despised and rejected and you're going to need to exercise patience that can only come to you under the revelation of jesus christ because the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy and you're going to need to have that kind of prophetic anointing on you down through the ages we realize that that he that we realize if we look at how that paul you know god had a purpose it's interesting because we see john on a prison island of patmos it's basically a roman version of alcatraz and you'd you in the human mind you'd say well wow you know john could be so much more effective if he wasn't on a prison island and just the opposite was true you'd think that paul could you imagine and and i i i don't think that we should fool ourselves into imagining that this didn't occur to the apostle paul sitting in dungeons chained to walls kicking rats away writing what we hold today to be the pure word of god you say man paul if he could if god would have kept him out of prison how much more effective he could have been sometimes friends god puts his church into positions where you think that this is a disadvantage but hold on you're under the spirit of prophecy just have patience have the patience of jesus christ because god is working out a purpose it doesn't matter what you go through god has a purpose in it brother branham makes a reference not only will we talk about john and talk about paul in prison but i think it's fair to bring up you know brother branham's life it's certainly a journey less traveled by people and no one really wants to go through tribulation let's just be honest but it is a necessary element brother branham makes a reference to how his his great suffering and i'm not going to get down into the details of all that today because we're just overviewing on our on our revelation series but brother branham i will just make a few comments how that he talks about the the suffering the loss of his wife and the child and and the rejection you know he says that you don't realize that a rose has to be crushed to get the fragrance out of it it's why jesus had to be crushed because he was the rose of sharon you can see uh in the life of brother branham how that he began to suffer isolation you know uh from the very beginning of his life and in childhood the very first thing that we find brother branham coming into the world he's born in abject poverty and then we find in his life story that his father you know commits a violent crime and then they're going to have to send the law up there on horseback to arrest him and so you know they have to flee in the middle of the night and he's got a he he he's he's basically a vagabond branham's were vagabonds he's being drugged from pillar to post we find that when his daddy sets up later on that he's a bootlegger and this is during the time of prohibition so now william branham as a child is even further isolated remember how he says he never got to play with all the kids because he had to pack water to a still and but but it was during that oppressive time that a angel spoke to him out of a tree and said don't ever drink smoke or defile your body in any way so god had a great purpose in it we find that you know when brother branham began to begin to grow as into a young man he talks about how that he'd be walking in town and nobody you know about nobody in town uh would be seen talking to him in public because he why he was a branham and and they had a they had a bad name you know his daddy had rejected him so you've got to understand here's a young man that god is is preparing for the greatest event since the days of the early church and he's got to have this prophet especially prepared he's born in poverty his daddy's a crook and criminal and breaks the law he's got to move then he's a bootlegger then he's packing water he doesn't get to play he's in he's a young man in the streets they'll talk to him in private but as soon as they see other people coming right away they act like they don't know him he said i'd see people coming down the street and they would see me and they'd cross the street to keep from talking to me in public because he had a bad name even though he said i never did those things but i was a branham and it was guilt by association his daddy had rejected him as a boy calling him he said he's the one that i raised which crushed brother branham you can imagine a young boy who idolizes his father being called a by the man who he you who was his hero so you know he's he's he's got all of this to contend with and and nobody you know nobody in public wants to have anything to do with him though he had been a model citizen and a very decent young man who didn't drink didn't smoke didn't run with women brother madam says if i if i was out with a girl and she tried anything you know he said i'd just take her home and so we we realized that he flees to the west he goes west because he had longed to be a cowboy really he longed to be out on his own and you know trying to run no doubt from all of that rejection i love the story that he tells here show us the father and it will satisfy us he says i remember this is before his conversion the first herd of cattle i ever tried to drive out of the mountains and my feet felt like two big hunks of lead i rolled off that horse and got my blanket and i i thought i was a real cowan i put my head in the saddle and there's an old guy there with us called slim and another fella from texas had a guitar they were playing songs and the fella slim had a comb with a piece of paper in it he keeping up with him in tune and and and the herd was all bedded down and after a bit they began to play down at the cross where my savior died it was down there for cleansing from sin i cried and brother branham says my my heart began to jump i took the blanket pulled it up over my head to keep from hearing it because i was a sinner and after the cattle got quiet and i was laying there acting like i was snoring but when i pulled the blanket down i thought now it'll all be over because they've gone to bed and and and to watch it out there with the cattle but then i looked up and then big stars was hanging just above me something said who put them up there seemed like there was a voice that said there's a land beyond the river they call the sweet forever we only reach that shore by faith to greet the degr decree i got my blanket and pulled it up around my ears again and brother branham says god is so great he'll find you i don't care where you are don't try to hide from him you're fighting a losing battle i'm glad to know that we're fighting a losing battle trying to run from him i've never been so happy to lose a battle in my life said he can see you everywhere he goes on and they identified with christ and he said i tried to pull the blanket up and stop my ears up i'd looked up in the stars hanging low and then whispering pines in the mountains seemed to cry adam where art thou oh cattle raising was a second thing i wanted to find god way back out there kicked up on a pair of those spurs i said sir i don't know who you are but don't punish me until i can find the real thing this was a prophet coming through severe rejection and this was john's warning if you're going to be in the kingdom you're going to be a companion in tribulation and you're going to need the patience of jesus christ he finally gets converted he later falls in love with a young girl named hope brumbach he marries her and starts a family finally now the prophet begins to experience some real happiness gets ordained to the missionary baptist church you know he's he's able to participate in something that he was proud of it was such an accomplishment for him because now now for the one of the first times he's got public acceptance and you know he even put a a tag on in front of his old ford that said clergy and brother branham was very proud of that and everything was going good until it wasn't and finally he had to give up that fellowship card in the baptist organization because he wouldn't endorse women preachers because it was contrary to bible teaching so again he's rejected again because and and again because of taking a stand for what was right so he loses a this coveted public recognition he stumbles into the pentecostals you know and and and gets thrilled with that tries to take his young wife and family in that direction and then his own family comes against him his mother-in-law rejects him he'll not take my daughter to such a thing like that and while hope would have went along with him he doesn't go through with it and now the whole world comes crashing down on him 1937 flood and everything that he loved in the world he loved the most he would lose looked as even as if god himself had rejected him when he's trying to pray for his baby he finally pieces his sad life back together again and god gives him a new family he has a visitation from an angel gets a commission to go forward he begins right away and right away he begins to gain acceptance very quickly among the pentecostal movement almost at an unprecedented scale it's all going good until it wasn't and we find out that once again rejection isolation churches start rejecting him all the doors eventually close he comes to 1962 and he says the present stage of my ministry all doors are closed demas has forsaken me and we find out that once again the words of john are coming to pass i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation but from all of this god brings forth the greatest collective event since the days of the early church we're going to get the opening of the seven seals giving birth to a movement and a message that has literally gathered a bride from around the world it's more relevant today than at any previous time i i even today enjoy the privilege that brother branham never enjoyed to preach to a mature church and brother branham's day they just had an infancy to them but we realized that at this greatest epoch of human history that had ever been known because it's now the consummation of the ages and the day of the lord when all the wrong is dealt with and all creation is set back in its correct order then an eternal day dawns on from there i'm here to tell you something friends brother branham says in the revelation chapter 4 part 1 i got to close he said can anything happen to a christian without it's for the best no no no so what did god set him out there alone on the island for to give us this book of revelation god just pulls the wool over the devil's eyes anytime he wants to he simply can he says i just love him so this makes romans 8 28 come to pass all things work together for the good of them that love god all right now i realize that there might be things i'm saying that i've said before in various other sermons i'm trying to get this book of revelation on recording so that we have it on the archive so so he comes to verse 10 i was in the spirit on the lord's day and so we we realized friends that you're going to need i'll just say this as i close out my take my last two minutes uh to close out that that this verse 10 so in my mind so perfectly follows verse nine that says you're going to have tribulation and you're going to need patience and then john says i was in the spirit on the lord's day because the lord's day now is where we have come to uh and it's the time of judgment it's the time of the total rejection of god's word and i'm here to tell you you're going to need to be in the spirit to endure it there's going to be no way the pattern you know is being established at the onset of the church that the way of the lord is a despised way as jesus said it would be you know if you look at even from eden starting with the serpent you know nobody liked god's way not the serpent not eve the serpent didn't like god's way because his daddy didn't like god's way satan had not liked god's way and so we find that that you know we we we have to come into the spirit first corinthians 12 13 for by one spirit we're all baptized into one body so no wonder it takes a supernatural change in the soul or i'm here to tell you nobody would endure this level of rejection nobody could endure the judgments that even we as the bride the judgments beginning to rain down upon the earth you won't survive i'm here to tell you now that you've arrived in verse and verse 10 you better take heed and be in the spirit because being in the spirit is the only way that you're going to endure the day of the lord amen we're going to stop right there i'm completely out of time even used up my five minutes overtime and so god bless you and uh the regular service uh will commence shortly god bless you you
