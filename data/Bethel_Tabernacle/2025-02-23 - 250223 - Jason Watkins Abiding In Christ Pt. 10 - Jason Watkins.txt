certainly worthy of it amen you love the Lord you sound like you do amen appreciate all that wonderful singing and worship amen we greet you all in the name of the Lord this morning we're going to uh read our scripture and then we've got a number of prayer requests this morning um sister Brenda asked for continued prayer uh she didn't quite feel quite over over the hump enough to make it this morning and she's streaming now and asking for prayer amen I'm glad for the Lord is touching sister Debbie she's still coughing quite a bit so uh amen you might just get a fist bump from her but amen some of her girlfriends told her I ain't worried about it just give me a hug so uh I'm glad to see her recovering she needs to recover because we we need did actually last week to go quickly to see her dad he got down pretty close there we weren't sure what was going to happen and she really couldn't she couldn't travel she couldn't be around him if we if we traveled so we're uh asking the Lord to continue her healing amen baby Phoebe sister Phoebe amen Anna Hope's newest little arrival beautiful little girl and um amen I'm going to I'm going to say it on camera looks like her grandma amen praise the Lord Sister Lisa will be happy to hear that amen so we want to ask the Lord to continue to touch her she's uh progressing along but you know they've got to still to figure out the procedure they need to do amen for her so sister Jee wrote in especially today to please remember her in prayer there's a number of families away uh traveling today there's Ministry teams away Brother JD his family are in Canada ministering brother Brad Sister Sarah way uh down with brother Joe this morning so um amen he's ministering there and a number of families traveling amen but we're here the Lord is here amen so we'll remember those as we go to the Lord in prayer I want to invite you into the scripture to Genesis chapter 1 this morning amen greetings to U our visitors amen there in the back God bless you we're happy to have you amen praise the Lord Genesis chapter 1 we're just going to I have a lengthy reading so we're just going to read a couple of verses we'll let you be seated and and um dismiss our um musicians and then we'll continue reading this is the creation story amen Genesis 1 and one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water now it's interesting because if you realize that the Earth is without form and void and it's a little while later in the scriptures that we understand the principle that God will not allow his word to return unto him void so when he sends forth his word it it'll take something that's void something that's chaos like we're reading here in Genesis and the word is sent to bring the chaos into order amen it's sent to take the void and make it into what it was supposed to be is that easy amen amen let's pray father we thank you for your revealed word that we are gathering around this morning thank you Lord for the text that we have read we'll continue to read we thank you for this beautiful sunny day we are asking for your blessing upon the speaker and the hearer we know already that your word is blessed so it's we lord who need your blessing today that I might be free in my spirit to speak Lord as you as you give me the leadership to speak and we have many things on notes that we feel you want to say but Lord It's always up to you ultimately you're you're able to say everything I have written you're able you sometimes you won't say any of it and you'll just change me completely sometimes you'll cover a portion of it or Lord sometimes you'll stop me from saying something I was going to say so I'm just surrendering to you right readily this morning asking you to be the preacher in our midst now our sick and Afflicted Lord we're thanking you for what you've done for them already and we're asking for your continued Mercy Lord we have wonderful testimonies that have come in of great mercies that you've shown to your people people even recently Lord and we're grateful for those things and we're asking that you continue that beautiful work that you do in the lives of your family now bless your ministers Lord who are away ministering and bless us one and all today we pray we commit it all to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated amen let's continue in our reading and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day and God said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the water from the waters you're you're reading about a very meticulous being this is a a a being of great precision and God made the firment divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so and God called the firmament Heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day so this is a being who who knows what he's doing he's definitely not fig fing this out as he goes he's accomplishing a purpose all right that's the whole word of God is to accomplish a purpose amen all right and God said let the waters under the heaven be gathered thank you brother the Tony to gather un one place and let the dry land appear and it was so I love how that everything that God decides to do it was so and God called the dry land Earth and the and the Gathering Together of the waters is called he sees and God saw that it was good and God said he keeps repeating that it was good goes to the next day and it was good and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so this is a being who has literally thought of everything nothing's going to get past him you need to have that confidence that he sent a word don't worry nothing's going to get past him he sent you everything you need to get you home amen and the Earth brought forth grass see it just obeyed God's word and brother Ram talks about how that God could have the Bible says he you know the foolishness of preaching which is astonishing to me that he sent Fallen preachers to redeem Fallen people and bring them back to some kind of perfection no wonder the world calls it foolishness and a prophet said God could have used the trees to preach the gospel we could have used the wind he said in fact had he done that it had been over a long time ago cuz the wind and the trees would have just obeyed him it's man that gives him his problems see all right all right and so verse 13 or ver let me finish 12 again and the Earth brought forth grass herb yielding seed after his kind the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good there that is again God saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the thir third day so we're clicking right along here and God said let there be lights in the firmament the heaven to divide the day from the night this meticulous being goes on to say and let them be for signs let in other words let them have a purpose I don't just put them there to put them there all right and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of Heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so why brother Jason are you reading this text in this way because I'm trying by all help of the holy spirit that if I can nail down today that that you are here for a purpose and that God gave you life for a reason and he knows what the reason is and he has the purpose set his his problem is not what he knows or doesn't know the problem is in what you are willing or not willing to give him control of all right uh so he says let's let's carry on where were we at we were at 16 let's get 17 and God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good in the evening and the morning were the fourth day now can I ask you a question if God is all of this busyness and this is covering Bible days not not Earth days Bible days Thousand-Year Cycles then and every and everything he does is good would you really worry about him controlling your life do you think you could match his track record of everything being good in your life if you give him control see now he doesn't say that you would like everything he does in your life but it'll work together for the good if you allow it see and God said verse 20 and God said let the waters bring for for abundantly the mo the the uh abundantly the moving creature that hath life and foul that may fly above the Earth in the open firmament of heaven and God created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged foul after his kind and God saw that it was good and God blessed them and said be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters uh in the seas and let foul multip Supply in the earth and the evening and the morning were the fifth day and God now we come to the sixth day now watch and God said let the Earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing the Beast of the earth after his kind and it was so and God made the Beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and God saw that it was good and God said let us make man in our IM image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth now he goes on down and on down uh and verse go let's go to 31 uh Caleb uh and God saw everything that he had made and behold now watch watch him increase it it's very good amen all right and the evening and the morning were the sixth day now turn with me to Revelation chap 22 ain't you glad I let you be seated for all this revelation 22 and let's start at verse 16 I Jesus have sent M Angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and The Offspring of David and the bright and morning star that is an astonishing statement I am both the root and The Offspring of David you remember matth Matthew tracked his generation backwards to David and on back to Abraham but Jesus is saying yeah I Am The Offspring but I'm also I was before David this is going to be important as we go I am the root and offspring of David and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely so the bride has a voice and a message that is an invitation to come to this one who is the bright and Morning Star that's her job see all right for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and of the holy city and from the things which are written in the book now this is not just merely doctrinal uh destroying Doctrine adding to Doctrine or taking away from Doctrine the people who are going to face these plagues and face this destruction are people who when God tried to bring his word into their life they altered it they changed it they added they took away because they wanted to live the life they wanted to live and therefore your life is a voice so therefore you added to the word and you took away from the word and though no wonder the world in in overwhelming majority is going to go down in Tribulation plagues and judgments and have their names removed from The Book of Life don't do it friends don't do it let the Lord have all the way and will and word and his word is his will let that be your life and refuse anything anyone says refuse what you say refuse what anyone thinks what you think we only have one one source to get us home amen so it's all about surrender watch he which testifieth these things saith surely I come quickly even so amen come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen now okay now there's my text so I I I want you now to just think with me for a little while so in Genesis 1 vers 1 through 28 and I and I want to say this I want to say this that everything he did in Genesis one that we read was not just God doing a one-off amen that he just did that and that's a historical event it has no impact today that is completely an upside down way to to look at it it was not a one-off God was initiating a plan in Genesis 1 that would run all the way through human history to now the plan would never change cuz he never changes his mind about his word now the atheist doesn't believe in him at all all and the agnostic accepts some kind of originator some kind of higher power but his view is generally at best that this being is is is impersonal and he isn't involved in human history but actually nothing could be further from the truth than that see firstly this being is the almighty God Of Heaven and Earth of all the heavens and earth and has been uh very much directly and what's he been doing he's been getting his generation from Genesis 1 to revelation 22 and he starts in and in the beginning God created and at the end of it he's coming down and he's saying now I've got a bride and she's got a voice and this is my this is the final display and I've been spending 6,000 years getting her from there first I had to build a Heavens now I had to build an earth then I had to bring it in order then I had to go I had to go down the evolution tree and start you know getting the the water supplied then the Earth supplied then the animals then I came to man and then I started working with man I sent him my word he rejected it he fell then I sent a substitution to redeeming back and this is what's been going on for 6,000 years so for someone to suggest that God is impersonal and not involved in human Affairs that's the probably the slickest LIE the devil has ever told Humanity so in the days of creation it's interesting that he he what he's been doing is he's he's been getting his Generation Now what are his what is who are his generation and I have to and and a lot of times we if we say who then a lot of times it sounds like we're trying to exclude some and this is a this is a M club and you know and it's not it's not about this isn't a clubhouse you understand Jesus died for the sins of the whole world all right so the the the gospel goes out to whomsoever will it doesn't really say who will or anyone will but whoever does can be saved so so we realize that that that that when we speak about his generation it's those who were originally made in His image so whoever comes into that IM image is part of that original creation and the fact that their life is an image of the word proves proves their origin amen you understand it demonstrates their origin it's interesting that in the days of creation we see that God and I and I and and I heard a Hebrew scholar talking about this and I made some notes of what he was saying I don't read Hebrew and I don't I don't read it at all but I was following a Hebrew scholar and he was talking about how that in the six days of creation God demonstrates three different ways through three different ways why the creation of man when he made Man In His Image was to God far more important than all the previous five days all right and the first thing that he shows is the word count in the Hebrew text and he actually had a piure of the Hebrew text of of all the creation days and it just might as well be Egyptian hieroglyphics to me but this was his breakdown and he started talking about how that that that you when you start on the on day one there's about 30 some odd words describing days one and day two and it ramps up slightly to day two then it ramps up into the 60s 60 words uh covering day three and day four and then in day five it drops back into the 50 but then in day six it launches and pegs at 148 words more than double what he had originally uh and and and almost triple uh from day one secondly it it's also the only place in the six Bible days where he says it is good it is very good amen the third way is that in the Hebrew text it is the only Creation Day that has the definite article that appears in the text and he shows a highlight of it you can see wow it's different than the previous five days and so the point to be taken is that is that the most important things are not the stars and the galaxies and the fish of the Sea and the birds of the air the most important thing is that there's a creation In His Image something that's brought into his likeness and is blessed to multiply in His image going forward so you you realize friends that that that this is so intentional this is so planned this is so controlled th this is not a controlled experiment he already knows what's going to happen we've already read it in revelation 22 amen so he's not going to fail no matter what void in chaos he won't let his word return voice and he'll bring the chaos into order that's what he did to me that's that's what he did to you that's what he's trying to do right now see so David could see that he cared for men David looked up into those Stars I behold the heavens and what is man that thou art mindful of him brother Bram would say that he cares and he would preach a sermon called he cares do you care and he would go down it's a beautiful sermon brother Bram goes through the Bible and walks the people through the scriptures as any word Prophet would that's why I've told you before when you listen to a tape remember that you're you're being taken on a journey go go with him get your Bible go with him you're on a journey go through the scriptures and he's going to show cases where how God cared and he come in the days of Abraham the days of Moses the days of David and God showed how he cared and he comes to a a young man and a and a woman and there's a terrible problem in the in the home and the marriage and the man is losing his mind and and and they had just left an interview and and brother bam can't even get hardly gone the people are gone and the man is having a nervous breakdown and they bring him back and and and and and and to shorten the story it finally comes down to God comes down and discerns what's wrong and heals it and breaks the power of the devil which was a lie and that's what the devil lies to you about that you can't be everything God wants you to be you can be and he has sent a word to accomplish it amen come on and he says see God cares cared about that young man he cares and brother brandham says does he care oh my does he care and he says but the question is do you care you got to care first then he'll care see so do you get it friends that that he's been active over 6,000 years getting his creation from Genesis 1 to revelation 22 and that's what he's been busy doing all this time do you get it that you have been called and chosen to be an active participant in something much larger than you do you absorb that young people teenagers do you absorb that you haven't just been born in a certain family and come to a certain church and hear a certain Doctrine you have been invited and you are compelled to be an active participant God wants to see your life walking through the word of God Amen see amen so why you know a lot of times we we wonder you know and and I think it's a fair question for a preacher to ask you you know why why do you keep or why would you keep building your life here in the way that you desire when you know when you already know by the Bible that the that the heart of a of a man that's born in sin is deceitful it's desperately wicked the Bible talks about the heart because it comes in a fallen Condition it's it's deceitful above all things and desperately wicked I don't think God could use pler language to get you to understand you can't trust your Fallen nature why why the so the question becomes why would you keep building your life here in the way that you desire when you know your heart in a fallen condition is deceitful above all things and will lead you every time away from God right amen it will lead you and what does that even mean let me let me bring it down to your address it'll lead you away from God's plan for your life amen so why why do you take it you know uh to to mean I mean what do you take it to mean if I could say it that way what do you think it means when you pray and you say Lord come into my heart come I want and people pray that and think that you know they they're coming to a conversion they hear a sermon they follow in conviction and the and the invitation is given why don't you invite the Lord to come into your heart and people bow their heads and they say Lord Jesus I accept you please come into my heart come into my my life what do you take that to mean if you're going to stay in control wh what does that even mean to you see my PowerPoint please Brothers I want to catch these quotes uh just the last end of some quotes that I had last time we're taking a subtitled day second book of Acts this is what we read at the end of of of of the ninth installment today's part 10 one day down on Jordan after that Masterpiece had been formed and made speaking of Jesus made here he come descending down on the wings of a dove that's him this is John baptizing Jesus in the water he was so enthused with this masterpiece until he struck him on on Calvary that he would die for the rest of us that's imperfect that through the shedding of his blood he might bring many masterpieces being a bride to his son so this is like when he takes Michelangelo and he makes the sculpture of Moses and he gets inspired and he he strikes it and he says this is what God did God got so enthused his son was so perfect it was it was a masterpiece he had looked for and he he tried he couldn't get it in Moses he couldn't get it in David he couldn't get it in Abraham they all had mistakes they all made errors he couldn't get it in Noah he couldn't get it in anyone even John the Baptist later wonders if he is even Messiah so but now he's got one it's a perfect Masterpiece and he smites him at Calvary watch Masterpiece is scarred because the enthusiasm of God to see such a masterpiece I hope you'll absorb that word enthusiasm God is in has a lot of enthusiasm for what he wants you to be he's not passive he's active see so he struck him for us all there he died to perfect we I love that to perfect we who are imperfect there's no denominational mixture in it anywhere anywhere my house my children born of my jees amen glory to God my jeans now watch this are in them I put my word in them I'll write them upon the tables of their heart that's my family the family of the body of Jesus Christ his family yes amen see now let me see do I want to oh yeah his his family the body of Jesus Christ the family all right now you you have to be very careful when you when you go and you start talking about the expression of God and because because the danger is pantheism of course and pantheism just simply is a is a heretical teaching that's remember there always has to be a genuine to have a counterfeit some sometimes to counterfeit can be very close but it all it takes is one word off amen see one three-letter word is what got Eve and so pantheism depicts the universe as all coming from uh all coming from a single source and therefore God is simply the whole universe and if I would say William brandham said he fills all time space and Eternity a theologian would go that's pantheism and it would be except for the point that William circles back around and says now he's not like the wind he is a being he lives in a house see so it's not pantheism at all it but it is but pantheism is a counterfeit of what is true that that all of the universe is an expression of God I mean that's what Paul taught us that we are of him in him and we are of him and we come from him and we're in him and he's in us see but yet at the same time you're not self-existing and you can't exist outside of his life and there could be no life outside of his life amen so that's that's the that's the the difference so so you know I when we teach on these things the last thing that I would want you to to think because this is definitely I'm not here to teach you know this is not a philosophy class and we're not here to teach esoteric philosophy or Eastern mysticism we're here to live and move uh within the Practical side of these mystery truths there are mystery truths that are sent and they're not just mystical truths but they're but they actually come for a practical purpose to become from God's thoughts to God's word to live life and then you are the final voice to the final age does that make sense so don't ever get so far out there that you just dance and glory and shout and scream because you've got a lot of stimulation from Revelation and out the door and never apply anything it's not why we're here am it's not why we preach we're here to preach to transform lives into the word amen because you don't come into the world anything like the word uh you're you're born in sin and so the word comes to transform you it's why the the Apostle says not to be conformed to the world but to be transformed by the renewing of Your Mind through the word of God so so we we have come to him at at his invitation we have we have this what we've discovered we have come to him at at his invitation we came weary and heavy laden and he gave us rest in the Holy Ghost but we've discovered in our series that that that's that that's not so we can just kick back put our feet up on the desk and go to sleep amen or as you've heard me say amusingly we are going home on the ship of Zion but he didn't tell me go down to the docks and sit on my luggage and wait for the ship see we have come to him can I say it like this we have come to him but we have come to [Music] become we've come to become something more than we've been to learn of him because he said come unto me we weary and heavy laden I'll give you rest but then he goes to the next level now take my yoke upon you learn of me and you'll find you not not that not that I will just give but you shall find rest for your souls so this is you on the journey when God has brought you to a New Birth it's not just okay you're saved see you in heaven the whole purpose of Genesis is still to be working in your life and bringing you to the image of the word amen hallelujah I can't explain it more clearly so we to learn of him I mean why would you learn if not to do why would you why would you go to school if not to become and then and then have see so so so we realize then that we have come to take take his yoke upon us and continue his ministry that's the purpose of why he brought you to rest so that you could then become like him and then he could have sway through your life and then the gospel goes forward so now this was the last quote we read last time what a rebuke to Christianity we're supposed to represent God and eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God he alone has eternal life and we are products of his because we're genes of his spirit that beautiful then now is that true then we should conduct ourselves women and men like the Bible said for us to do not Jezebels on the street and Ricky of the organization but Christian gentlemen Sons and Daughters of God born of the spirit of God manifesting the light in our day and scattering it that's exactly right see all right so now so now when when we when we we we're just going to carry on you good all right I'm just trying to go slow but in a I'm in a hurry so so you want to realize friends that the gene the Gene's from God it's a spiritual Gene It produced his family and and we we talked about this how that Matthew track the genealogy of Jesus 14 Generations back you know through the um through the through the Captivity and then 14 back to David and then 14 on back to Abraham and there's 40 some odd generations and and we even showed you by science that after 20 Generations there's almost no perceptible amount of you in your in the people of your Offspring after 20 generations and he's more than double that and yet and yet Matthew doesn't call it the generations he calls it the generation and so we realize that John said to an unbelieving generation he didn't call them Generations he said you Generation of Vipers plural so now sin has become generational and the Earth is walking around and you've got a generation of Jesus Christ and a Generation of Vipers and Jesus said to those same Generation of Vipers why can you not understand my words why do you not understand my spech because the truth is not in you you're of your father the devil he was a liar from the beginning that's what you're doing you truly show who your origin is in so these aren't things that we've invented these are things right out of the scriptures so although in Jesus there was no biological DNA of Abraham David or Joseph his supposed father there in Nazareth um he was no biology of these men right and it we don't mean over Generations I mean even to the even to his day Joseph he had no biology of Joseph or Mary see amen no physical biology yet they were all from Joseph and Mary and John and the prophets going back and Prophets through captivity and Jeremiah and all the way back to David and on back to Abraham they were all all every last one of them though he had no biology of them they were all a part of him from the spiritual Gene of God that was with God proceeded from God and was a part of God he was not a descendant of them in fact it was just the other way around to further blind the unbelievers he actually said to them actually before Abraham was I am amen so he was not the continuation of their generation they were a part of his generation and I just want to say today that that generation is my generation that family is my family and although I share No biology with them but through the blood of Jesus Christ by faith in the atonement I am joined back through Christ to Abraham and I'm part of their family because with Abraham it was always going to be a faith seed Not seeds plural not all israels even Israel but it was the faith seed so that's good and and that's good that I don't share you say well wouldn't you like to share biology with David I would not amen because I don't want to be identified with any of his failures I do not want to be identified with with Moses losing his Temperance striking the rock twice I don't want to be identified with Abraham backsliding leaving the promised land lying twice almost got himself killed almost lost his wife I don't want to be a part of what David did and Nathan the prophet had to confront him I don't want to be a part of any of their failures I don't want to live throughout all eternity I don't want to live through all of eternity identified with the failures I've had oh I'm here to tell you something friends I'm rejoicing today that that spiritual Gene surpasses and puts away every failure that I've ever had in this biology Hallelujah he says in fact watch this let me get it back in in second Samuel and David's anger was greatly kindled this was when Nathan told him about the man who stole another man's single lamb David's anger was candled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die and Nathan said to David Thou Art the man thus sayith the Lord God of Israel I anointed thee King over Israel and I deliver thee out of the hand of Saul that's verse 5 verse 7 check out this one 13 and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not die oh I'm here to tell you something friends David stood there before Nathan the prophet and he was absolutely guilty of horrible sins and God said your sin is put away and and and David was Israel's greatest King and he was living there he stood living in a lump of Fallen biology and that's exactly where we have been friends born in a lump of Fallen biology but this is not my original and this is not my end I'm going all the way to revelation 22 I'm going to have a new body that has never known the mistake or the first transgression we can't get out of it here that brother Caleb was covering that Wednesday about the RAM and the thick of that's always I remember way back in the day when I was young and preaching and I I looked at that and I started doing the Hebrew look into the Hebrew of what does it mean that he's he's caught because it's a representative of Christ I don't want to break the whole thing down it's a sermon by itself but he's caught by his horns which was the strength of the RAM and that's what held Jesus on the cross that's what held him they said come down and save yourself and save us but had he he could have done that but had he saved himself he couldn't have saved them you understand so what held him on the cross was his character and his love for you and I when it would have been so much easier to take the the the the the you know to take the easy street he would have still been the Son of God he would have still been the Lamb of God that wouldn't have changed anything but he stayed on the cross because the horn held held the RAM and he couldn't get free and that was the character of Jesus you see the the the fact that he was caught in a Thicket that's a Hebrew word that means interwoven and it it it's what makes a garment and so the thicket meant he was interwoven because he hadn't started as a human Oh my he started back in the eternities and God said let there be but now here he comes and what does he do when he was in MDC he what did he do he just took some the 16 Earth elements and he built a body blew blew it into existence and God stepped into it and went and met Abraham and Abraham worshiped him and God and mikz didn't stop him see and El and Abraham even called him the almighty God in the Hebrew go look that that word that Abraham calls him is exclusively 100% the the only the almighty God is called that Hebrew word never does it is it used in any other way other than to speak of the almighty God and so and when he's done with that body what brother Bram said we now we don't hear no more of MDC because what he do stepped out of that body went back to the 16 elements and he said later he became Jesus Christ now he's the only begotten because he's now born of a woman see he's not just a created body with God living in it who could step in and then step out but now he's begotten he's born of a of a woman he's caught in a Thicket of humanity and he can't just step out he trapped himself to go to Calvary for you and me Hallelujah friends no I don't want to stay in this biology I want to have a glory IFI body like under his glorious body Hallelujah a body where those mistakes and failures don't exist in fact have never existed to where we come to the point where we're back like Adam before the fall we're made of 16 Earth elements and and and even those elements have no sin in them in that new World Imagine a body that has no sin in it at all see so it is this spiritual ual Gene that connects me through Christ back to David back to Abraham before the beginning when and I didn't read it again today we read it last time when as brother brandham said God stood there on this is poetry on the mystical platform of the eternities and rolled worlds off of his hand I was in him then he is in me now if if I was in him then does it seem strange to you for him to say abide in me now if you were in him then does it seem strange that he would invite you to abide in him now see so we are returning to this Immortal Life The Immortal Life That's absent of oh my it it's it's it's as glorious for what it doesn't have it's as glorious in that way as what it does have I mean we're talking about back to an eternal life that is and try to try your best to just get your mind as close to this as you can you won't be able to grasp it until you get there but imagine going back to a an eternal life and a and a body that is absent of any concern at all there's no anxiety over anything there's no stress because there's nothing to be stressed overl see people sometimes as the Bible said I told my wife I wasn't going to look at that clock today and I just did but you'll be okay cuz you know I'm not a long preacher I don't and I know the whole cowboy statement nothing no death worse than being drugged to death so we're not going to do that but and this is moving fast you good amen but the Bible speaks about people in God's family you say well how do you know it's describing people in his family because of the last line of the descriptive of the description and it talks about people in God's family who have no doubt you know had an experience with the Lord but they but they they they're not diligent and allowing God to have control of every aspect of their life and they keep trying to build their own life and just close enough to not make God mad let me just kind of just get that part I just kind of really want that part Lord you okay don't don't hit me with lightning and it talks about people who build their entire life over years decades and they come to the end of their life and the sad reality for them is that they've built out of wood hay and stubble now they were supposed to build out of Gold Silver and precious stones yes and I'm not saying they haven't known the Lord I'm not saying they haven't had a true experience with the Lord I'm just saying that and you say well then how do you know that's God's family because in the end it says that it describes and I'm not going to read it today but it describes how that when the trials and the fiery things come and the judgments of God their whole life burns down and everything they've built and invested in yet they themselves will be saved see yet so we're talking about a person who in the end is still saved but they built their life on wood hay and stubble and instead of the Tre precious Treasures of God's word oh I'm here to tell you something friends that is not supposed to be the plight of the child of God don't build your life on wood hay and stubble chasing the American dream the the world dream the global dream some political dream some scientific dream surrender everything you have to Christ and say come into my life take completely over amen and build your life don't build it on something that'll just burn down in the end and you'll it'll come back to haunt you amen it'll come back and things will come back in your life and you'll say Lord why are you letting me why are you making me go through this he was tried to prevent you from go going through it amen see now in case you didn't know God's family could make that mistake now you know am you know know I I think about that that those cares and you know and I and and I and I don't mean this as a segue I want to speak about the the last conversation I had with my dad and I'm not talking about a man who did that who built out of Woodhead and stuball I want to make that clear my dad was the greatest man I ever knew but it it just in my memory I was thinking about the last conversation that I ever got to have with him before he was intubated never could speak again and he went down from there and on down and on out and uh he's now in a young body living in glory and you know he had concerns and his concerns were for his wife and his youngest son and really at that point I can tell you brother Eddie had no other concerns he had already told me he said you know Jason he said when I was 64 he said I had to have triple bypass heart surgery he said when they were rolling me back to to go under he said I kissed your mother goodbye I remember that I still remember that and he says and he said when they said Mr Watkins now they put that over his face we're going to count you backwards he said I laid there thinking I do not know if I'll wake up still on this side or on the other side But whichever happens it'll be fine and he said to me he said now I don't know now here he is he's he's he's he's two months away he's he's only got about 2 months to live now we're not believing for that we're hoping and tray praying and trusting but that was God's plan when Genesis 1:1 was written amen and he said now I don't know what the outcome of this will be son he said but I just want to tell you however it turns out it'll be fine and those who knew brother Eddie he would just always throw his hand up fine it's fine you couldn't threaten him because he'd go fine knock yourself out you know and so so he that that you don't know what a treasure that has been to me to have to have him look me in the eye and I knew when I preached this funeral I would see him again but it it it weighed upon me as I was studying this sermon I thought you know what a glorious position my dad was in because at that point somehow he was he I think he suspected he might be close and suddenly all the cares of life and all the raro and all the rat race and the the rat race we enter to try to win it and we win it we're still a rat and and all the troubles and trials and hardships and heartaches suddenly they meant very little to brother Eddie and he just said if I wake up on the other side it'll be just fine he only had a concern for his wife and his son and I and once I alleviated that I said dad you don't have to worry I said me me and the boys I said we we'll take care of Mom she'll never want for nothing and me and my sons will gather and and they and we do it and they do it and daughter-in-laws take care of sister Jean and and and I said and I'll even uh make up with Nathan and I'll try to help him and then the Lord ended up taking him later because the Lord couldn't get him to to repent but yet he was a son yeah just like just like Saul in the Bible and so so I I thought to myself that is this why what what I was witnessing of of my dad is this why had he found that secret that not only only had he come weary and heavy laden years ago and found rest but had he also learned of this Messiah had he taken his yoke upon him and now coming to the end of his life this life meant very little after almost 80 Earth years all it mattered to him was take care of my wife your mom take care of your brother and I'm going on to glory and I'll see you on the other side oh that's the invitation to all of us today and you don't have to wait till you've been here 80 Earth years to come to that come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy lighten and I'll give you rest for your souls take my yoke upon you learn of me you shall find rest for your souls I think that this is exactly why Jesus invites us to this let me come to my last slide I quoted this for you a little bit ago go off and on oh uh yeah let me go off and on then back on and then switch Advance it for me it should or no I'm yeah uh Advance all the way to the very last slide to the very last one we're GNA bypass those right there Isaiah 5511 you good amen and I'm turning a coin for the Finish Line you good can I have you 10 more minutes you'll keep your focus so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not that's definitive that's definite it shall not return unto me void but it shall not maybe not probably not hopefully it not if you cooperate it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing wherein to I sent it I'm coming to a part that I've been trying to get to since probably part three as Believers we can all look each other in the eye and be honest and admit that sometimes as Believers we find ourselves at distance from the holy spirit's influence in our daily lives amen the ham as I would say grinds and ruts of daily living day after day and sometimes this is this is what happens this is what I observe in my own life and this is what I observe as a minister sometimes I can see God's family get into this point and day after day leads to weeks which leads to months and if left unchecked I've seen it go for years where I know someone is a child of God I have every confidence and I know that they love the Lord and they really do it's for real and they believe the the word for real and it's not just persuasion they actually have a divine revelation and they they're marching to Zion they have absolutely come to him and found rest in the Holy Spirit but sometimes we have to admit that we find ourselves at distance from him and we find ourselves standing too far away from the Lord and needing to get back yes how many have had that I'll raise up both mine we wonder what happened to those early days when our experience in the Lord felt fresh and meaningful and we long for the Revival back to those days that we had with the master and we're very sincere in it we we we we we make you know we have fits and starts and but but too often we we we find ourselves struggling for the progress we hope for am I am I speaking to real people today sometimes we we just find ourselves I want to be more than I am but I'm struggling and I wonder if we're brave enough to admit that sometimes sometimes we get ourselves too far away from the Lord uh and and I just need the Lord to come down and do something in me sometimes we need can I just say it like that sometimes we we just need the Lord to just come do it and I I'm trying and I'm I'm not making it I'm struggling and I'm stumbling but I keep trying and tomorrow I'll try again Lord I'll never quit I'll never stop but I I I want to make progress I Used to Know You in a greater way I used to have your spirit wrapping around me I used to be able to pray like I so unfed what happened to those early days amen oh friends now that makes us feel bad that makes us feel bad that we have to say Lord just come and do it but can I suggest to you today isn't that what he did when he first found you you couldn't save yourself you couldn't come to him but he came down he did it himself and he reached further down than I could reach my hand up to him and I want you to know today friends that the same thing he did then you knew it was him and you knew you couldn't do it and he reached down and you you took a hold of his hand and maybe that would be the Cry of your heart today after 10 installments of abiding me to say Lord I want to abide I want to come higher than I've been you should know by now that there's another level amen oh Hallelujah and maybe that would be your cry maybe this entire Series has been tailored by the Holy Ghost host just for you can I say to you today friends summon your courage and cry out to him and just say Lord I'm going to throw away all Pride why don't you stand to your feet and just lift up hands and say Lord I'm going to throw down my pride and I'm going to raise up my hands and I'm going to say I need thee Oh I need thee every hour I need thee oh Lord Jesus hear Honest Hearts today has he not come to you many times oh yes amen has he not friends has he not come to you many times again and again and again will he not come to you now I tell you he will come do you know why he will come because he will not see his word remain void and he sent his word and you're a part of his word and you will not return to him void you will come back in that perfect condition and I just say today Lord God whatever you have to do bring me under the opes of that promise let that word be a governor of my whole life how many today say Lord be the governor be the high priest be my king be king theophany be the Lord Of Glory to me no matter what is your need today friends come brother Tony I need thee oh I need thee it's an old Anthem amen I believe we can sing it amen look for that brother Caleb I need thee I need thee every hour I need thee bless me now my savior I come to thee that being who filled all time and space will come to you right now I have labored and preached my heart out these 10 straight we started back at the end of last year and God has just held me to it and every time I would think I would get near the end I was telling you we were at the end after part three and then it just kept coming and it kept coming and I said Lord am I not getting it are we not getting it and it wasn't that it wasn't God being repetitions these 10 parts are not just a repetition of all of of itself we have journeyed friends haven't we we've went through a journey in the word of God and I'm here to tell you something that one who fills all time space and Eternity he'll bring you up into his orbit why will he because he will not allow his word to return to him void he will continue to work in you until he he gets you home hallelujah oh I tell you he'll come to you he he he he he'll come whatever is your need today if you're if you're sick if you're in trouble if you've got a coldness in your spirit he'll come to you he'll come all the way from Glory I think about how that that brother Brandon talks about that when he stepped out of Eternity he said he'll step from the eternities to you today just like he stepped from the eternities and came and took the book he'll step out of the eternities and he'll meet you today Hallelujah friends do you love him I have had many days just let it be a stepping stone of encouragement to you I have had many days where I felt too far from him say how many of those days you had brother Jason too many right too many but I'm done I'm done living at distance from the Lord I'm done living in this dark world without his glorious light to shine down on me I want to have his whole word his whole life every aspect of my life will you make that commitment to him today friends all over the building out across the airwaves will you make make that commitment to him today to say Lord I'm done being at distance from
