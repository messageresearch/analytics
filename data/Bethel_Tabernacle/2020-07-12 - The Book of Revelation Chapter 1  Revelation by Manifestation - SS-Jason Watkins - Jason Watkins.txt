[Music] [Music] [Music] you good morning god bless you amen let's open our bibles and stand and we'll just have one verse here to read we are continuing in our study on the entire book of Revelation so where we're going to take this for the next while until we go through the whole book so greetings to the larger audience who are streaming today just a reminder that we don't we're not allowing a live audience there are a few people here brother Tommy's with us again visiting amen and we have our officers here and our booth crew sister Debbie of course follows me around everywhere I go so she's here today so I sure I'm happy to see her here in church she's missed a number of services from the illness I want to thank everybody for their prayers and I'll probably do that again when I come out for the regular service let's look in verse 1 of Revelation chapter 1 it's a simple verse it's very straightforward the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John let's pray father we thank you for your word Lord we realized that there is a blessing and reading it there's a blessing and even even hearing it read so master we commit it now to you of all days Lord now that I'm in this study lord I really trusting in you as you always do Lord come on the scene in a in a special way for teaching and help me Lord to stay in that frame as I've thought about it quite a bit and father I commit myself into your hands for service now completely yours now in Jesus name Amen god bless you friends as you're seated so we started in last Sunday on this series and we took a title of low resolution versus high resolution or low res versus high res and we were just explaining some fundamental principles about the book of Revelation it is apocalypsis and it simply means an uncovering it is not a new creation it is something that is there but it is shrouded in mystery it's locked it's encoded it's encrypted and even things that there were certain points within the book John having been given a commission to write everything that he saw and heard comes to a certain point in the seventh under mystery and because that that is related to the coming of the Lord then John was told don't write what you heard about that he can write everything else but don't write that because that pertained to the coming of the Lord in his second coming and even Jesus was very silent on that if you go into the Gospels and he begins to talk about and parallel his cut what will happen in history and what will happen in Matthew 24 at the end of the world then he he jumps over his coming is a great mystery when they asked Jesus on the Mount of Olives concerning the establishment of the kingdom he won't answer the question he says the father has that that's up to him and he has that in his own time but you shall receive power after that you this Holy Spirit comes upon you because what God was intending was to create a church that would span unbeknownst to that group at that day it would end up spanning 2,000 years through seven Church ages and so the book of Revelation is an amazing book it is the brides book particularly for the endtime I want to make that statement going in this is a book that was brought to the church even after Paul was already gone and so he never read the book of Revelation and John brought it back locked up and there was no promise that it would be revealed in that day it was promised to the church that it would be revealed at the end days now to them they probably were looking for it every day just like they were looking for his coming every day we are looking for his coming every day but it encourages my heart to see that God kept his promise and has opened up and unlocked the book of Revelation in this last day it is a sign to the bride that her homegoing is soon it is it also a harbinger to the world a harbinger of doom I'm afraid for those who miss the catching away the sudden secret catching away of the church the his bride so we realized that the church corporate the remnant of the woman's seed she ends up in the tribulation you can read it very clearly that's why many scholars mistakingly believed that everyone goes through the tribulation and indeed the church does the remnant of the woman's seed does the 144,000 elected Jews do but the bride does not go through the rep the tribulation because the tribulation is a time of judgment and the bride who are born again of the Spirit of God are already judged in Christ at Calvary and that's why Jesus could confidently report to that redeemed family that in st. John 5:24 when you believe on him you pass from death to life you will never come into the condemnation you'll never come in to the judgment we can find imagery of it in the book of Revelation the Bible talks about how that the the sea gave up its dead and all the dead both small and great stood before him the heavens fled over the skies and heavens fled away like a scroll and the dead both small and great stew before him Matthew 25 gives us a wonderful rendering of it we find that he's a king judging on the throne he he's judging people who some at that moment will receive eternal life and some who will be sent to everlasting destruction we realized that the bride the elect family of God those who were born again by the spirit are not standing in front of that judgment bar they are seated with Christ they are sheep of his fold and Jesus promised them promised all the overcomers that you would be granted to sit with him in his throne so we're not going to be judged before his throne I will not I'm not part of the of the second resurrection I'm part of the first resurrection the same resurrection that brought him out of the grave and brought the Old Testament Saints out of the grave who would believed with true faith and so we find then that this book of Revelation is a great book and you know it's it it's it's amazing when we began to study the book of Revelation that you're going to have to understand some principles going in before we start breaking down the symbology because it's a book of symbols and they all have a meaning and every word has a meaning and a place and it has an order you cannot read it like a newspaper that is that has caused more error because people read it linearly like a newspaper page one page two page three chapter one chapter two chapter three chapter 7 chapter 8 9 10 11 12 and you're gonna find that many chapters come up go actually and have a fulfillment before the previous chapter and then then there's an interlocking and then this one ends up back over here and this one's back over here and you find that all through the book of Revelation that's why the only one who could reveal it was Christ himself and he promised that he would do that at the last days that he would raise up a messenger his seventh seventh star as part of the seven messengers to the seven churches and that seventh angel messenger an earthly nada not a heavenly angel an earthly angel a prophetic office would come and he would be standing on the earth and he would receive from the mighty angel which was Christ the open book which is this book open and made alive now you're going to find and and then then there comes the question well how can we know how can we have confidence in this prophets understanding and teaching of the book of Revelation how do we know that he's accurate we know the same way he knew that when the revelation came to him he went back into the Bible from Genesis to Revelation and checked it by the word and if it didn't dovetail with the word it's wrong it has to dovetail every revelation that we uncover and that we will uncover that have been brought to us in this endtime day you will find as a student as you go along through the scriptures with me that you will find that it all agrees with all the scriptures now I'm taking this subtitle the revelation of Jesus Christ and I don't fuel advance for me brother Josh to the next slide I didn't pull up so it's a sealed book that you'll see here it says the revelation of st. John the Divine but it's actually that's somewhat of a misnomer because it makes it sound like that this was John's revelation John was merely the scribe to record everything that he saw and heard it is as it says in the very first verse the revelation of Jesus Christ it is the only book in the Bible that Jesus personally wrote himself and used a scribe to pen the words you have Paul writing the book of Romans he wrote first and second Corinthians where he goes all the way through and you have Jude writing an epistle you have John writing several Peter writing a couple this is one that Jesus wrote and so he uses John to be his scribe he's recumbit from the his prison island of after being there two years he's the last living apostle he's the only one who dies a natural of natural causes they tried to kill him they tried to boil him in oil they couldn't do it because the laws of nature worked in his behalf just like a submarine goes to the depths of the sea and it's not crushed though the though the the the metric tonnes per square centimetre on the hull of that sub are so great the metal itself could not withstand it and the metal would crush but the sub is pressurized from the inside so there's more pressure pushing out than there is pressure pushing in and thus it doesn't get crushed John was boiled in hot boiling oil on the outside but John had a hotter boiling oil of the Holy Ghost on the inside and therefore the oil had no effect on him they believed in history that John bewitched the oil and so they put out his eyes but he didn't need eyes for this book because God would give him spiritual eyes that could see much better in fact is his natural sight would have very likely hindered some of what he saw but when you don't have eyes and you you get sight given to you by God you tend to believe what you see and so we find then that take me to my next slide brother Josh so here is our opening text of verse 1 and I want you to take this word here revelation by manifestation that's what we really want to focus in on today in this very first verse because you've got to settle the revelation of Jesus Christ who he is who he was who he is right now what he was doing in his first coming what he's been doing in the church what are his plans for now what are his plans for the world coming these things are all promised to be restored to the last day Church that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel that seventh star that's the messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished in other words this last church is going to be given not a new mystery they're going to be restored back to the original mystery that the Apostles understood and then they're going to see a further manifestation because there were while it's not new teaching it you you learn by manifestation and the manifestation is the understanding it is the interpretation as as God had said through the Prophet a virgin shall conceive schools of theology argued for seven centuries but when God got ready to interpret the meaning of that he brought it to pass and a virgin conceived and bore child board the Holy Child Jesus and that manifestation was the interpretation it was the revelation of the prophecy and at the manifestation put all argument to rest they still argued against it then they still do today doesn't matter people can raise all kinds of arguments against the truth God doesn't need anybody's approval or their permission to reveal his word he doesn't take counsel the Bible teaches us even from himself because everything that he would ever know he Oh has always always has known and God cannot learn a new thing so he reveals himself all down through time by manifestation now that's that's real handy for you and I because we can see him doing that all through the pages of the Bible for instance we can we can come to the the message of this hour and we can say things like this is the seventh age we had the seventh messenger this is the time when we gain the ultimate victory and if you and it was it was the mighty angel who descended down with and to speak to an earthly messenger and it was the it will be the bride who actually finishes the manifestation the seventh messengers already came and gone but we're here and the mighty angel is still here and we have the word being interpreted to the world by the lives that we live and the ultimate interpretation of the rapture of the church will be our literal physical translation that is a Mount Zion showdown there was a Mount Carmel showdown there was there was Mount Transfiguration there is now going to be a Mount Zion showdown and people who take a body change are going to prove that that was always true what Paul said that we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye people can argue about what that's going to be but when it happens that will be the interpretation and so you find that God does that now just you take that instance in all those sevens and an earthly man and a heavenly being and instructions for people you can go right back and and we're crossing into we sing the song Kanaan's land and now we realize Canaan's land in one sense doesn't represent the millennium because they were still fighting and killing and ret and there'll be no fighting and killing in the Millenium it represents in that regard the Holy Ghost the land of the Holy Ghost that we cross the Jordan that's death to self we're born again in the land in the promised land of the Holy Ghost however in a larger sense it certainly would it certainly would be the promised land of a millennial world that we are going to inhabit but how do we get there and if you look and see that Israel in their exodus had a prophet in our Exodus will have a prophet that that prophet led the people and it wasn't the Prophet that took the people across that prophet went home and there was another man Joshua who represents Jesus who represents the Holy Ghost who took the people across into the promised land and when we get over there you see all of these symbolisms now you've got a you've got orders to march on a city to do an impossible thing this was Jericho was unprecedented in its day Israel had never had to fight a battle like this in all their war campaigns they had never encountered an impregnable Citadel such as Jericho it was the most amazing Citadel in all the East at that time so they've got instructions going take it but they don't have any instructions on how they're going to do it so we find that Joshua is reconnoitering the area to figure out a battle plan when he sees a man dressed in armor now God had appeared in many forms he had appeared to Abraham as Melchizedek he had appeared to Abraham and the cool of the day as Abraham said in the tent the door of his tent and so he had appeared in all of these various forms he had appeared you know as an angel he had a appeared to Moses as a pillar of fire burning in a bush that didn't consume the bush but this is the first time that he's going to appear as a soldier and Joshua doesn't yet know who it is Joshua moves on him and with his sword ready to either fighting or welcome him and it doesn't matter to Joshua he's got a question are you for us or are you against us if you're for us great if you're against us you're dead and it's interesting that the soldier says to him I'm neither one I am the captain of the Lord's host so it's not about you know being for or against what what Josh was beginning to realize is this is in our fight after all this is his fight he's here to tell us how to do it interestingly enough the instructions seemed preposterous March around a city and come back and do it again the next day and be quiet and do it a third day and a fourth day and a fifth day and a sixth day and on the seventh day you'll on the seventh day you'll March around it seven times and then you'll blow a trumpet and then the walls will collapse and every man will take and go forward and these are the instructions that are given to him by this being who was nothing less than Almighty God now you know it was Almighty God because Joshua immediately fell down to worship Him he never tried to worship Moses he never never got confused on that he never tried to worship a man we don't worship a man we don't worship the Prophet we don't worship the messenger he has his place he completed his assignment he went home to glory but the one that's leading us who we worship is Christ the revealed word of this hour and so it is our mission to interpret that buyer lives to the world who thinks they understand him but according to prophecy there will be many false prophets who will deceive many it is the mission of God's bride to interpret his word correctly so that there is a accurate representation of his word now again how do we know it's true because everything that we teach dovetails with all the word if you'll notice that Joshua when this when this soldier says to him I'm the captain of the Lord's host there's no record that anything changed visually he didn't start glowing he didn't start levitating angels didn't appear around him he was still a soldier standing there but by the word he spoke alone with no other visible sign his word caught a revelation in Joshua's heart and Joshua fell to his knees and begin to worship this being who had revealed himself by the word because the word he gave matched what Joshua knew the Commission to be that God had promised I will take you over I will lead you I will place you he said that to Moses I have heard the cry of my people I have come down now so so Joshua knew that here he is ready to take a city you're gonna march around at seven times on the seventh day you're gonna march seven times on the seventh day and you're gonna blow a trumpet and you're gonna shout and you're gonna go forward and so we see then that that the that the imagery in the book of Revelation that we say here's a seventh messenger he was a seventh star he's one of the seven spirits and you can go back to look at Joshua and you can say wow that matches just like they had to defeat the enemy we've got to defeat the enemy they took Canaan's land we've got to take Canaan's land and you had an earthly messenger and and God appeared to him in a form today we had an earthly messenger and God appeared to him in a form the form of his word the form of the pillar of fire and then we see it manifesting in our lives and we see these words coming to life in our life that's how you know you have passed from death to life now so so this brings up manifestation this indicates to you when you can do that when you can go in the book of Revelation and then you can go back into the book of Exodus and then go back into the book of Genesis come forward into the Book of Isaiah flip over into the Gospels go forward into the epistles and you keep finding these dovetailing parallels dovetailing parallels then you realize that this is one book it's one book that's a big important point this is one book written by many authors over many hundreds of years and but it is one single book and because of that reason that it's one book then you cannot dismiss a single word of Saint Paul any more than you could dismiss a single word of Jesus of Nazareth you cannot dismiss a word of Jude any more than you could dismiss the words of Christ you cannot take anything that Peter taught anything that John taught anything that Paul taught you can play it at one against the other Jesus said you shall go Jesus gives his Church of prophecy you'll go into all the world you'll preach the gospel many will try to kill you thinking they're doing me a service they'll hate you for my sake but just remember they hated me first you'll have trials and tribulations he's prophesying but be of good cheer I've overcome the world in me without me you can do nothing in me then all things are possible so he says when you go you will teach all nations this was a prophecy you'll baptize them there was nobody there to baptize at that point he said this is something that's going to happen you'll go you'll teach all nations you'll baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost and then when the Holy Ghost fell on the church what did the church do they started manifesting the interpretation of the words of the Lord they brought prophecy into real time and they started baptizing people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ everybody that was ever baptized in the Bible in the early church history is replete with the record they were all baptized in the name of the Lord no one was baptized under titles until the four hundred more than three hundred years after the death of John now why is that because the church became a manifestation of the words of Christ and their manifestation was the inerrant interpretation because Jesus never said used the titles he said because father son Holy Ghost her titles not names and the Catholic Church started that in the in the fourth century and they started baptizing in titles the early church never did that not one time you know brother Ernie Villanueva our good friend he does Bible mystery expose in foreign countries he's done it many many times and he's never lost money but every time he does a mystery Expo he has a room full of denominational doctors of theology with PhDs and brother Ernie says to them I have a check today for five thousand dollars and I will make it out to you or anyone who can find an instance in the Bible where anyone was ever baptized according to the titles of Matthew 28 boy you talking about men going through their Bibles and brother Ernie standing there with the check he's never had to pay it out because there's not a single instance in the Bible you can't even find an instance in history they were all baptized in the name Lord what does that mean it means that the manifestation was the interpretation and so we realized that when you when you look at the Word of God now let me let me let me let me give you this last point before we have to close I got about two and a half minutes and I'm that puts me 5 minutes into my overtime my grace period but you find this principle and here's a big principle I'm going to leave you with that that the Word of God even though it comes from God that that word has has no efficacy until it's made manifest now what the Bible had prophesied that that when a virgin conceived that he would come with the ministry that would set captives at Liberty that it would open the prison doors and loosed men and women who were held in chains of bondage and that prophecy was a real prophecy from God through a prophet but it never had any fulfillment until Jesus is born he's now he's now the man he's now the he's the he's the manifestation of Isaiah's prophecy a virgin shall conceive that had no efficacy in the world a savior is born God is going to send a savior that had no power that had no effect on mankind every man that died still went to paradise he could not go into the presence of God even though the Prophet said that this virgin shall conceive and bear a son and it shall be Emmanuel and he shall be the savior of his people no one was getting saved until he was actually born until that word became flesh and then Jesus picks up the book and picked opens the scroll and he's and he reads that portion of Scripture the Lord the Spirit of God has anointed me to preach the gospel to to bring glad tidings to set at liberty them that are cost to to open the eyes of the blind now that word that had always been God's word now found power now found efficacy now found fulfillment it found it it's found its power to to do things in its manifestation form God said let there be light but that was just his thought and then he in order for it to become real he's got to speak it so a thought then becomes a word but then when he speaks it brother Branham makes an interesting point he said what if he said let there be light and no light would have ever came he said that a man could almost be excused for disbelieving God but when God said let there be God actually had to believe his own word he had faith in his own word and then it became when God actually spoke it then creation starts moving and now you've got a light that can be seen you've got an earth that he can plant a garden in he had all of these plans but until it became manifestation all of God's characteristics laid dormant within him and had no effect on anything until it was actually made manifest these prophecies in the book of Revelation have laid dormant for 2,000 years parts of them have been fulfilled in history a study of the book of Revelation shows that the church fulfilled many much of it is already in history much of it's already past we'll get to that when we're teaching it but we are now at the part friends of the unfulfilled parts and God has sent a messenger to reveal to us what to look for what to expect to be able to gauge ourselves against the standard of the word I mean to tell you what you think doesn't matter it's only what His Word says what the world believes or doesn't believe is in material to God his word is still true and the only people who are going to get a manifestation of the body change is people who accept the prophecy of the word that he gives in order to get you to that body change so god bless you apologize for going a few minutes over we will begin our regular service I'm sure it will come on very quickly god bless you [Music]
