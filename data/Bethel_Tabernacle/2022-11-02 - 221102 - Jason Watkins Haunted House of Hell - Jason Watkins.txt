to have him in the service with us this evening I don't see any other visitors but I could easily miss you trust me I could easily miss you God bless you as we turn into the Book of Revelation chapter

people who are here tonight would testify to that we're going to try to amen give you an opportunity to testify we won't get to it tonight but we're going to give you an opportunity amen got some things in the back of my mind wanting to plan a man praise the Lord Revelation chapter 6. and we're going to just catch two verses that are particularly pertinent to us and the day and hour that we live in this is uh this is uh you're you're living in the Fulfillment of this verse and it's being fulfilled actually it's it's partially fulfilled and being fulfilled and will continue to be fulfilled after the bride is gone verse 7 Revelation 6 verse 7. and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that sat on him was death and Hell Followed him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the earth amen let's pray father we thank you now for your word that's been read and realizing Lord that there's a great blessing in reading it and in hearing it read we ask you now to come and anoint it Lord to our hearts now father it must go to our hearts there there it's impossible for us to achieve this station and that we desire Lord to stand before you Lord in the in the Robes of your righteousness that can't ever happen Lord with just a mere mental decision it's got to be revealed to the heart of the individual so I pray tonight Lord that you will grant us that great grace and that great favor Lord and reveal it to our hearts tonight we're happy to be home we thank you for the Saints gathered here with us Lord there's just a few under the weather tonight we'll be offering prayer for them shortly but Lord we want to look into the word and see what it is you have to say to us this evening we commit ourselves into your hands in Jesus name amen God bless you as you are seated I'm sure you all know my title amen I thought to myself actually I I didn't really think of this until after the fact but um you know when I when I I realized that there's been a lot going on with haunted houses and Halloween and all kinds of things like that I I tell you I'm I'm glad to be free of the influence of this world but I thought to myself as I was pondering that when I realized that my goodness this is my very title haunted house of hell now brother Branham you're going to realize here in just a little bit I'll read it in just a few minutes about a dream that he had about people who were in what was said to him was a house of hell and we realized that when we come into the day and hour that we are living in that the fourth seal is open and the fourth be saying come and see and here is a Pale Horse now the thing that makes him pale it's it's not it's not pale just like like a a ghostly white it's a sickly color that's like you see someone sick you say my goodness they're very pale and it's a it's a grizzled Burly type of sickness it's actually a a combination of the three previous you had the White Horse you had the red horse you had the Black Horse and coming down it's all the same devil he comes into the last age and he is a conglomeration he is the he is the total cluster of all of everything think about it friends of every of every bad thing that has ever been in the world is clustered together today that's why we say that we are living in the worst day of human history there's never been a day thank you brother Kenny like this day in the earth and you know the good news for us is we we're getting hot we're getting out of here oh I I'm so glad that you know the only way out is up and that's I'm glad I got a ticket to go up but for the world brother Branham would talk about that very thing uh coming to the I think his last one of his new year I think his New Year's Eve sermon 1964 where he just kind of puts it on the table and says you know it's uh thank you for Luther it's a glorious day for the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ he says now it's a very sad day for those outside of the blood of the Lord for those in the world for those who have made their decision that Satan would be their their God he's the God of this evil age and people had a choice and they have a choice and there's a choice tonight thank God there's a choice say oh I wish there wasn't a choice well that's going to happen for the Gentiles anyway once the bride leaves because God can't bring the Judgment uh and and cross it over blood and because that that the that the the bleeding word is in the bride of Christ then then she's the manifestation of grace and the Earth God can't bring the tribulation while you're here but when you leave Grace leaves you understand when you're gone for the Gentiles then that is the end of it now there's still there's still grace and mercy in the in the world because the gospel goes to the Jews there's still a work of the Lamb to continue and the work of the Lamb continues even after that and there's a lot of the work of the Lamb headed on I know there's some misunderstanding about you know the lamb being finished that's actually not accurate we find all through the Bible that there's many places after we're gone where the lamb is still got a job to do he's still very much active so you know I'm glad to be the Bride of the Lamb I'm glad to be the Lamb's wife and so we find that that this bride even in the Book of Revelation it shows a difference there's a difference to be made you know between the Heavenly Jerusalem or you know the holy Jerusalem I think as the as Paul would call it and then there's the New Jerusalem and that's of course a physical City but yet we also realize that in the Millennium there is a holy Jerusalem there and there is a there is a a holy city amen there's a new city that's coming after the Millennium but in the Millennium there is a holy city called The Heavenly Jerusalem and when John saw that it was a bride prepared for her groom so we we realize then that the bride while she's here we are the conduit of grace and mercy to the world now the Bible says here that this White Horse I'm sorry this Pale Horse when he comes that his name is death and Hell Followed with him so I I don't think it should be that big of a stretch tonight if if we talk about a dream that brother Branham had where he sees people in the Earth today that's a dream now but he had a spiritual connotation that where it was a house of hell that shouldn't be a surprise given that the fourth seal has broken open and when that happens there's a death coming in the land and Hell Followed right with him so we're not just looking for hell as some you know at some place you know after you die hell has come to the surface brother Branham clearly said that the lid is actually torn from hell that's quite a statement we'll take a prophet to say it the lid is torn from hell and demon powers are streaming into the Earth that's the age you live in that's exactly where you are I'm trying to get this mic from to stop popping like that I'll keep adjusting it I think we'll get it so so that is that's the reality of the earth that we live in now I I love the fact that you know when we if you look in first Thessalonians 5 I'm not going to go there tonight but we find that you know Paul talks about you know uh I mean it's a it's a real message of Doom Hey Brother Caleb let's put that up just just so we can refresh ourselves first Thessalonians 5 and we'll just look at these couple of first couple of three verses I think I think verses one two and three perhaps first Thessalonians 5 and we're to start at verse 1. and if you don't um I can okay here we go all right so Paul's saying here watch this he says but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write into you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night now for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them and he goes on to talk about you know uh but but the good news is God has not appointed us to Wrath we are children of the day we are children of the light we are not of the night we are not of the darkness it is not appointed wrath is not appointed to us the day of the Lord means something very different from for us than it means for the rest of the world the day of the Lord and we find is the time when God is coming to execute his judgment upon the Earth and before he can do that he brings his wife home for a wedding party like has never been recorded and so so we find a wedding supper and a celebration but we but we realize that there is a terrible wrath that's coming upon the Earth and it it is it is not just a destruction but it's a sudden one and then the very fact that it's that it's sudden means that at the at the point where it's going to be destroyed there's no need for a buildup because you're living in the buildup a buildup's not coming a build up is happening this is this is Prelude to tribulation this is a house of Hell on the earth and I'm not talking about a haunted house that they want to put up here because of some Devil's holiday I'm talking about a haunted house and with a haunted house comes a haunting I really am trying to turn into my thought tonight the real burden that the Lord has put upon me brother Branham picks up in the message uncertain sound the uncertain sound he preached it oh my goodness I I glanced at it it looks like at least maybe eight or ten or a dozen times I was drawn which is a little different I usually go if I've got multiples I'll usually and I feel drawn to a certain sermon I'll usually listen to the to the latest one and to my surprise I felt compelled to go to the very first one in 1955 and I have no way to tell you just how unusual that is but it was exactly what the Lord wanted me to do I want him to make some statements tonight and and just try to bring you into into my thought so brother Branham talks about how that the human body that our makeup now this is an astonishing statement that our makeup this Humanity all right that our regular Anatomy that we live in here is not made to sin that's why people who live in sin collapse that's why it's it ruins their life that's that's why believers who stumble into iniquitous Behavior have nervous breakdowns over it because you know you're not you're not meant to lie the child when he tells that first LIE there's something in him telling him don't do that so he said it's it's made and I I love this it's made your this is your human body your regular Anatomy is made to do righteous it's made to serve God I could not give you a better recipe for peace and Harmony and a tranquil life than to say serve God I couldn't give you better advice I couldn't help you anymore you say life is really overwhelming and I got this problem and I got that problem eyewitness say draw closer to him because your body your regular Anatomy is built to for righteousness and and if you and if all you got to do is use the word of God that lives in your soul and put your Fallen flesh under obedience I promise you your body will acquiesce your body will just go right along with it because it was made I go to my knees in prayer quite easily I don't go to my knees at all quite easily but I love going to them in prayer amen so so you know the the the body says I I mean just common the body says I'm too tired to go to church that's not uncommon you're not a sacrilegious person for feeling that way but the inner man loves it and when you get this body here he loves it am I right or wrong I come into the presence of God and I was so tired I barely had to make myself get ready I'm not talking about tonight I'm just speaking metaphorically are in general but but I find that when I come to the house of God I am so glad I came I love clapping my hands and singing songs and worshiping God and feeling the presence of the Lord and hearing the good preaching of the word of God God never made you just to work and come home and love your children that's all good see father Brown's not not doubting that that's good that's good God God made you to work God made you to come home love your children love your wife and the wife to be loyal and love her husband and and the children love their father and mother that's all good that's how God Made You It's the devil that interrupts that when you don't see that happening when you say a home absent of love and the husband doesn't love the wife and vice versa and the children don't respect the parents and they don't love each other and there's absence of love and the absence of respect you know that's the working of this horse rider you know that that's the God of this evil age and he's trying to turn that home into a home of hell I was reading the other morning in a morning devotion Spurgeon I don't remember which day but I thought it was remarkable because he took the scripture where Paul is writing to Anis for us and he says you know I want you to greet those the church that's in your home and so I don't know on this verse perhaps was some type of Pastor maybe they didn't have a church where he lived I don't know maybe they were holding home Bible studies or Home Services he says the church in your home and Charles Spurgeon takes off on that and says I wonder how many of God's family can say our home is church he said where you've got instead of a pastor you've got a father you've got a mother you've got worship you've got the dispensing of the of the of the word of God you've got followers you've got prisoners you've got children brother Brandon called a mother the child's first pastor so I mean I I know that homes today are filled with every kind of entertainment and every kind of vice and every kind of connection to the world I just wonder if we have church in our home first church just a building we come to a couple of times a week something to think about right so when I got to work that's fine God made you to work but he never made you distant work well I love my children that's good you're supposed to but he never made you just to go work and come home and love your children see that's all good see it's all good but that's just the backgrounds for something that God made you to do God made you to be a worshiper a worshiper of him now you say that's that's super simple it's actually has it's more profound than you might think because you being a human you're human right when in Genesis when God made man he breathed into him the breath of life and he became a living soul in the Hebrew that means he became praying dirt you understand because he the human animal the human animal was built to pray he's the only one who does he's the only animal that prays no other animal prays only the human uh your close mammals they don't none of them primates they don't pray at all they have no sense of spirituality only the human because he's building the image of God so if you don't even have a worship life in a prayer life and you're not in connection with your maker then are you a human say well I think I am well not according to the Bible according to the Bible you're just a beast without the Holy Ghost a man unconverted or a woman without the Holy Ghost is just a brute Beast that's scripture see it's def it's certainly not a Man created mankind created in the image of God because mankind created in the image of God is built to worship now even in a fallen condition here's how strong it is even in a fallen condition you'll worship something even if you're not converted even if you're the most ranked Center brother Brandon picks it up here he says he says it's just the backgrounds working loving your children loving your wife having having all of that is just a background it's all to me it's all should be to the purpose say why do I go work so that so that you can have a home that worships God why do I love children so that God will be present you understand working and finances and children and spouses and and family the things we call family we just take it for granted but there's a there's an exact thing that God calls a family and there's a thing the world calls a family they call it a family and they don't even they don't even have the correct marital order sometimes and still call it a family and we'll even bypass nature and live in a perverted relationship and go adopt children so they can have a family that is so twisted to go Global that has that has that has gone viral that was only even possible in the in the 21st century for that there was a local city called Sodom you've had cultures they've had all kinds of Gentile cultures that had that going on in it but it was always Hush Hush behind the scenes but now it's gone viral it's global it's it's completely accepted as normal I'm here to tell you this is a house of hell this is a haunted house we don't got to wait till Halloween you're living in a haunted house with haunted people God made you to be worshiper you worship something regardless of what it is you'll worship your wife your children your any it won't worship anything your automobile you'll worship your pleasure you'll worship something because it's in mankind to worship see now we want to know what we worship you know I one of the things that I was so struck with after the prayer line especially after the prayer line that we held on Saturday night we went down Friday and there's a spontaneous prayer line I guess you would call it that brother Josh didn't even uh I mean brother John didn't even make a call at all but uh the young people just came forward and we walked down and began to pray for them and then Saturday was more of a we set aside like brother Branham done we set aside to have a prayer line nothing wrong with that that's why the prophet ran it so we went down and we had a prayer line we divided out and that way we wouldn't be there all night I wanted to pray for all of them I wanted to pray for everybody I wanted everybody in that building being prayed for so we found a way to do it where they could come up and have some time to express their heart I wasn't there to hear their life story but I wanted to give them an opportunity to to say to say put it on their lips what do you need everyone that would come up I would greet them I would say what do you need what what's on your heart and there was some wonderful experiences there some some such fine quality young men and young ladies who were coming up and just weeping wanting more of God and that I thought that is so unbelievable in the 21st century I mean the the real true and living God is the most unpopular he's never been more unpopular and here is young men and young women beautiful in the prime of their life in the world wanting them but they don't want the world they wanted his majesty the king and then the the sad part of of the 30 20 30 I would say just to throw out off top of my head you know maybe as much as a quarter that came up with such heart-rending my heart went out to them so desperately they had needs that you know they wanted to have the Holy there's a lot of confusion over what it was in their minds and and I even talked to one young man about the Holy Ghost and showing him it's you know I could see struggling he's he's hunting he's he's heard I gotta have it he's a he's already loves the Lord with all of his heart standing there weeping and crying loves God with all of his heart and it reminded me you know of of when I was that age and other young men that I knew at that at that young age and you know and yet he's he he he's unsure is there something I understand I still got to get the the baptism the Holiness and I'm trying to I'm trying to back up and go my goodness where's the where's the balance what teaching I don't even know what church he was from I didn't even ask it's not it's not relevant I'm not here to criticize somebody I'm just simply saying that that I was just able just in a few minutes yeah he actually came to see me after the service on Sunday wanted to talk about it some more and we're standing there and I was just standing there talking to him out of the word of God and I just made a little statement how that the the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the new birth are the same thing and he was he was so stunned to hear that and he said to me I didn't know that and I said oh my yeah I said listen young man I took you more brother Branham is showing that that you know the the new birth is the sieging of God coming forth It's the holy ghost coming upon that it's a revelation of Jesus Christ it's a definite experience it's a moment where God reveals himself to you because you have completely thoroughly absolutely totally one hundred one thousand percent repented of all your life you'll never get the new birth you'll never get the Seal of the Holy Spirit if you don't fully repent if you still try to hold on to things of the world you're wasting your time my time God's time and everybody's time I want to say to you repent thoroughly and the Holy Ghost is yours the the weight that came off of that young man's mind he smiled I could see the confusion evaporate I could see the weight he was under so much pressure and it just evaporated off and he said well I I love God with all my heart and I said I can tell and I said and you want his word yes and you just want more of him yes more and more and more and more and I said my goodness brother it reminded me of that man who came to brother Branham and he said you mean I've had it all this my brother he jumped on the porch and hoisted brother Brandon if that little man could have hoisted me well it would have been hard but he he like he wanted to try he was so relieved to understand that now he's he's marching to Zion and every day he's now he's trying to grow and grow and grow he wants to be filled with all the fullness of the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ I never had a greater sense of need our appreciation for balanced Ministry that keeps its balance my brothers my ministering Brothers keep let's keep our balance in the scriptures and in the quotes I I so appreciate that they're they're some of you ministers who are here are raised up under my preaching for years you know that you know that some of you have come along but I I have so appreciated the brothers who have come along who who don't have an agenda and I'm so thankful for that their minds and their hearts are so clean they stand here and just deliver the word of God and I just say blessed be the name of the Lord keep it that way don't ever don't ever get out of balance like that we don't need to we've got a prophet that gave us the saith the Lord on the word of God I so appreciate that words would fail me to tell you how much I appreciate that but on the road of life people sometimes make devastating choices I heard on the bible study this morning I don't know who said it it was said he said he heard another Minister say it brother Tim Calhoun was at a Minister's meeting he didn't say who was it said it but it was so noteworthy and worth repeating the minister said remember that for every mile of road there are two miles of ditches that's what I said um wow I'm going to write that down and I did typed it down I do not the decisions you make I get you working you love the family you love children or wife or whatever you got a home but but that's only the background we're living where the fourth seal has opened and the pale horse rider is is already influencing and the only thing holding him back from his full ride is your departure is your presence he can't get his full ride until until we're gone and so I just say Lord God let me I found myself saying let me preach it harder let me let me pray more let me try longer I gotta find the lost at any cost we must never spare any expense we've got to find God's family all of my family all of your family all of our loved ones who are out there I'm not going to give up I'm not going to give up we're going to keep praying we're going to keep pressing we're going to keep preaching [Music] brother Branham in this message gives a a story he calls it Mrs John Doe now what he doesn't reveal here is he and nobody knows at the time but he's actually talking about an exact case that he dealt with that doesn't become clear until years later he finally decides I guess to spill the beans and and talk about it that it was an actual story here he's just telling them he said you know I just want to I just want to make it like an example and although when he's going down the line I'm sitting there saying my if I'd have been sitting there in 1955 I'd have said wow this guy's an incredible Storyteller he needs to write he needs to be an author because the details are crazy and but then I realized wait a minute yeah he's telling a real story no wonder see I know that those people didn't know that in 1955 in his Tabernacle he starts telling he calls her will call her and Mrs John Doe she's a good woman as far as we know she married Mr doe he was a fine Christian man I remember he's telling a true story passing it off you know it's just a spiritual example so brother Branham goes into this long elaborate story it's not actually that long but it's very intricate and very elaborate how that this woman you know she she got into feeling like maybe she didn't love Mr doe as much as she had at one time and suddenly she catches the eye of another married man and they kind of make eye contact and there's a little chemistry they meet at the fence and they talk a little bit and next thing you know you know people are going to be out of town and the next thing you know here goes in a fair full-blown starts up and and this woman is now you know living in a backslid and the home breaks up and bustes up and but but brother Branham says but she was a you know in a fine Church and I think she's even a Sunday school teacher and it's not revealed here but I remember it from another rendering of this and how that you know it it got to the point where now the the cheater man he he realizes he doesn't really like her anyway it was just a fling and he's going to go back to his wife now she's her home's busted and so what does she do she you know she starts thinking you know nobody was as kind to me as John was nobody was as pleasant but and she actually thought about maybe I'll try to go back and be reconciled but what she couldn't overcome was that wild side that just wanted to keep going and so she found her another lover and then another one and then another one and brother Brandon says all the while she's still teaching Sunday school she's still right there in church she's now she's married again and then that's over then she's married again and and the preacher's telling her you know it's all right you're you're a fine upstanding member of this church and we respect you and I you've had this kind of a life but don't you worry God understands you know and all this kind of stuff and brother Brown was just telling this whole story and finally brother but I'm talking about the difference between you know your mind actually your brain which part of your biology it's going to be important in the story and he says you know Salvation doesn't come in the mind I mean you make a decision for Christ but it's got to drop 18 inches into your heart and become a living revelation that's why people miss it a lot of times they as brother Brennan says they admire the fine qualities of Jesus but it's just a it's just a an intellectual experience and uh it's not it's not a hard experience it doesn't really change their life and so finally she goes on being told you're okay and doesn't matter the the level of debauchery you're okay it's all good until finally it catches up with her and she catches a public disease and now it starts eating her from the inside out and she's dying and she's laying there on the bed and and she's in the hospital and brother Branham said now he said what happens is as her body is starting to decay he said in the brain cells are starting to Decay he said it's like that little child who told that first lie and it got really and it got easier and it got easier and it got easier and it got easier and you you silenced that conscience it told you don't do that you're a married woman don't go do that but you silenced that conscience until finally brother Brown said the conscience stopped speaking the terrible Dreadful place to be because you don't know at any moment your life might be stuffed out and you're not going to be ready to go meet God and as she goes along she finally is in a hospital and she's dying and there's her preacher who's told her she's okay and brother Branham says now once all now once her brain cells start decaying this thing's eating her brain and suddenly all of that quieted conscious comes rushing back and in a moment she has this Epiphany this understanding I'm lost and she looks at her preacher you've lied to me you told me I was okay I'm not okay and I'm I'm being pulled into hell and I can already see demons Spirits appearing in the room and she's starting to scream in the and the preacher you know they he I mean he got called in there because they tried to get him to you know put your cigarette out please and come in here and try to call him you're pushing her down which is literally what's what he had to do I had to go out and they had to go get him because he's outside smoking uh can you can you come help us she's starting to lose it and he comes in there oh now watch this watch this you know uh calm down oh you've lied to me oh no no nothing of the kind and she's getting worse and she's getting worse and she's getting worse brother Brown says what is it the soul had caught up to her see the soul and the spirit is the thing here that the intellectual is fixing to fail it's only in the mind the intellectual what you've lived by is going to perish but that soul that you've grieved from your intellectual is going and I this was an astonishing word because my title was already haunted house and brother and I didn't know this line was in this sermon God let me do it but that soul that you've grieved from your intellectual is going to haunt you and when This Woman's Soul catches up with her she says my God I'm lost and they think oh it's Delirious they shoot a hypo and the needle to her and she begins to numb off she can't speak no more she's trying oh she's rolling she's in agony the doctor says give her another one she's dying anyway it doesn't matter just can't let her die peacefully there's no sinner ever died peacefully I'm here to tell you friends I I've I've been at the bedside of people who didn't know the Lord and it wasn't peaceful and I've been at the bedside of people dying who were saints of God and that was the most glorious moment everything they had lived for their whole life the the Christ they had served was going to receive them in two Everlasting Paradise they give her another one detoner and they deaden her until the death angel swept her spirit from her that hypo needle might Dead In the Flesh it might deaden the mind that can't deaden that soul that knows it sinned before God and he says it again it'll haunt her through the ceaseless ages he says that soul will haunt and haunt and haunt as the ages roll on you came from where Prophet is asking his audience and in the Tabernacle you came from where you go to where question say well I'm here now well when you're not here what then what's next like I said to you here recently what's the what's the point of life if you don't get an eternal life make it however happy and Rich and joyous and have everything in in the world like Solomon but Solomon said it's just a chasing of the wind it's it's Grievous it vexes him that he had blown his whole life out chasing the wind and he accomplished it he had more treasure more women more money more Fame the whole world afraid of him more power more influence and he comes down he's an old man and he says I'm I'm angry I'm vexed my whole spirit is vexed because I realize it's been a chasing of the Wind and brother Branham says you came from where you go to where you came out of Eternity you stepped at a little space of time you go out of time into eternity and what are you in your soul as you go out the same you'll be oh my the same you'll be death changes nothing brother Branham goes from that Dreadful scene and he comes to a message many years later 10 years later to be exact in 1965. and he's preaching works his faith expressed and he says he's telling the experience of a dream that he had he's starting to tell about being out there in Sabino and the brothers and he tells the story about brother mchughes my daughter-in-law Rachel is her former Pastor it had a condition in his eye he was going blind his mother had tumors on her feet and he's out there with brother Branham and this is when that Pillar of Fire came down and cut through the mountain and and and if you've ever heard the testimony of brother mchughes it's it's gripping I mean he said when that light came down that thing wasn't playing he said as it come down the side of that of that mountain he said it just ripped and sliced and cut and flung rocks in every direction and rocks flew out with such supersonic speed they cut the tops of trees off and it just went out like a bomb and they're all running and Diving and jumping under under vehicles and they come to brother Branham said if that hit you you'd have been a greasy spot he said no he wasn't trying to hurt me he said he was talking to me wow he said what did he say he said I don't want to tell you what did he say brother Bill said it was a judgment sign in a few days a great earthquake is going to strike the West now let now catch this because I caught this today for the first time as many times I've heard this message he says it's going to strike the West in meaning Alaska he says it's going to strike the west and it won't stop California Los Angeles will sink it'll go down she'll slide right into the ocean two days after that the Alaskan earthquake shook Alaska then the last meeting I had in California while speaking and didn't know nothing happened Billy though I got on the street it told California and started prophesying over them Capernaum Capernaum now brother Branham is not saying you're that ancient city which was along the seashore and was lost like Sodom and Gomorrah but he he he goes back and he says there's something similar to that Jesus used almost he didn't say exact even on the tape he says he said almost the same thing in the scripture and he says he says Capernaum Capernaum the city that's called by the name of the Angels now God has made a 20th century identification said it's the city of the Angels that's Los Angeles see and so he said it's called by the name of the Angels that's Los Angeles you've exalted yourself into heaven is that true they've got all their gods all their sports stars Hollywood stars movie stars all kinds of stars they've exalted themselves they they have a they have such worship there of the God of this evil age brother John Andy's made a statement that I wrote down in my notes was so astonishing he talks about the World Wide Web and I'm gonna tell you something friends you need to have the Holy Ghost these days that you live in this is no time to be walking around with just an intellectual experience you're going to need to overcoming power to just function and think about that in just everyday life I mean it's just a phone it's just a computer I'm sorry the worlds went this way how do I stay connected I'm in a business I got free I mean this is how I can't go live as a caveman and if I get rid of of a mobile phone and a computer and the internet I might as well be a caveman for because of where today is you understand the disparity would be so great you'd just you'd never know anything and people tell you what's wrong with you I can't reach you I don't have a phone what how do you live well how do we live before well but that was before everybody got them now everything operates this way if you want to operate you've got no choice I'm here to tell you this is the time to have church in your home that's the time to have parents who are full of the spirit this is time for teenagers to get the real the real Holy Ghost we're living in a haunted mansion made by Lucifer himself says exalted yourself in the heaven but you'll be brought down to hell for if the mighty Works had been done and Sodom that had been done in you it would have been standing till this day now he says he starts talking about the signs of the time I'm skipping skipping skipping and go listen to it you watch the water will come the water will come plumbed back into the Salton Sea Los Angeles is doomed it's nearly every Hollywood star you can think of it's the banking Hub entertainment HUB insurance hub it's our Western Seaboard defense it's everything he says Los Angeles is doomed for judgment I tell you before it happens that you might know when it does happen brother Brown is going to be gone in a month I never spoke that by myself and I've never had him tell me one thing but what happened this is an international audience he's not in his Tabernacle this is an international audience and he's making a pretty bold statement I've never had him tell me one thing but what happened and you can bear record of that and all you can hear in this International audience is is amen's all across the building ministers on the platform people can come today say what they want but none of his peers they all knew no one challenged him on that see it's so good to testify I love this statement I feel like this tonight he says it's so good to testify to real listeners We Believe oh Lord he says Lord we believe help our believer oh don't you like being a real listener don't you like being a real believer isn't it wonderful and so he starts to tell about a dream that he had he says I had a dream now it's just a dream he said I don't dream very often and he said I was standing and he said there was some man and I'm just skipping over trying to save time I want to be done in 13 or 14 minutes and he says there's a young man a very fine young man he was in shackles listen up Chris as a young man is in shackles decisions that he had made I'll only say that to Chris because we're tight you don't know our history we've been close for a long time I wouldn't normally do that but oh Chris is cool with it and so he says in this in this dream he says this young man he says fine young man but he was Shackled chains and people said Billy stay away from him he's no good and brother Branham said but I kept watching him and he said he was trying to get out of his shackles man he was trying to get out and he said and they said oh you better watch him he said and so I was watching he said and finally he did get out finally he got out he got out Chris he got out and brother Brandon said he'd come over talking to me said he was a very fine young man let me tell you something friends we don't know sometimes we can be too quick to judge but this is a haunted house that that the world is living in and I'll take anybody who wants out [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah try to help anybody who says I want out of this Haunted Mansion and he said he was a fine young man he said and somebody caught me by the arm and turned he said it's my neighbor when I was a boy I used to deliver groceries walk at Utica Pike and deliver groceries you remember Mom those areas they used to play there as a kid myself and I forget what he called her name and he said she's a very nice lady went down to a local church over here very fine very fine Christian woman and she said she said bill she said you've got to help these people and he said I I looked over and he said there was like a almost kind of like a seller and he said kind of like a down in like a cave and he said there were bars big iron bars and there were people all back in there and he's walking down to look and all them people are done in there and he said they're beating their head against the bars and they're wanting out they're wanting free and they're they're they're they're insane you're talking about a haunted house and she said she said brother Branham you've misunderstood she said you've been misunderstood misunderstood these people are good people and she says you've got to deliver them brother Branham you you got to deliver them brother says I I deliver it Deliver Us from this this is a house of hell deliver the people brother Branham said help us we're in trouble she herself I know her she belongs I believe the Church of Christ or Christian Church uh and and called Church of the Brethren I looked around and I said I wish I could and go on looking around and my little bitty body with them great big iron bars and those poor people in there and you couldn't get to them them iron bars was sitting close together and I looked and they were beating their heads like they were out of their mind and I seen some light flickering around there and I and I looked up now now here's a here's a hive here's a high place and he he sees light flickering oh where's this coming from oh and he says I looked up and there stood the Lord Jesus with the lights of rainbow the seven colors that's a covenant that's a covenant he's a covenant Angel when he came in Revelation 10 he's a covenant angel and he says with the rainbow colors around him and he was looking right straight to me and said deliver those people and he went away and I thought well how could I deliver them I haven't got strengthened up in my arms to break those bars and so I just sit House of hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ and all the creaking and popping and rocks rolling and bars falling and people running screaming delivered and screaming at the top of their voice and all was delivered and I was screaming then brother Roy borders where are you brother Roy had a problem with his eyes he's going blind and brother Branham had tried to help him and he said brother Roy snap out of it snap out of it said old brother Bill it'll take something more than that it's going to take a further Ministry because that's my words he said it's going to take more than that brother Brandon I got to have something more I'm here to tell you you're in the more you're in the day of the more and there's and this world is living in a house of hell and I'm here to tell you those bars are subject to the pride of Jesus Christ they're subject here you know why because you have the name House of Hell give way to the name and the and the the when the word is interpreted by coming to pass that's a manifestation of the name of God you are the name of the Lord Jesus Christ House of Hell give way and to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I begin screaming for other borders where are you where are you God is delivering these people where are you brother borders and I just say tonight if you're if you're finding yourself trapped and I don't care what you might be trapped in God is delivering his people I say to you house of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ we don't have to be in bondage we don't have to be behind the bars I don't have to live let me tell you something friends this is a haunted mansion but I got a world going where there's mansions and not one of them are haunted there's a house that I'm going to dwell in and it's not haunted it's never been wrong it's never had a sin it's a perfect body a perfect mind a perfect spirit oh I long for that I say oh Lamb of God let me be in service to you let me resist the enemy and see him defeated in the lives of the people this is where we are this is the land we live in this is the age we've come to the world is transitioning it's transitioning friends you young people you remember brother John talked about I said this in a large Ministry group that I'm in and I put it in there brother John Andes had said you know speaking of transition he said you know when God took by the Branham home that was like a statement that was God saying now the bride can go on without her prophet he's finished he's wrapped up brought home to his reward his labors are over now the bride can go on because now she's going to be a global bride around the world assemblies are going to rise up in all the darkest jungles of Africa and all the most remote places of Asia it's going to cover North America and Europe it's going to go this thing's going global and there's a bride today who is standing under the revealed word of the hour and she is the name of Jesus personified is that what you're a part of you see he said you know it's like a relay race the Baton is handed off and a profit runs but finally it's time for the bride to run and as he's as he's you know as he's reaching his baton back and brother John said the problem that a lot of people have had is that usually it's in that handoff it's in the transition where the Baton gets dropped if it's going to get dropped nobody really drops it running but it's in that transition and sometimes we've seen them get dropped and and and and then this Transit and we're transitioning now we're transitioning for home friends we've turned the last quarter Hallelujah oh I see the bright light shining and I don't want to drop the Baton I want to make sure I got a firm grip on it I want to make sure I'm Marching In the beat of the Gospel Hallelujah I'm not looking to stay in this haunted house of hell I'm looking for a house not made with hands [Applause] Eternal in the heavens never haunted by anything oh let's stand to our feet friends this is the hour of total freedom this is the hour of complete victory this is what God has allotted for us in this day this day that you live in is a day when a when a bride around the world gets changed the dead in Christ rise and we are changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye thank you sir I was never so proud to be with young men and young women this past weekend it was so beautiful to see so many in the prime of their life seeking more of God seeking a closer walk bow your heads with me all over the building just whatever you choose brother Ken with heads bowed all over the building now you know that I didn't make any of this up tonight you know the condition of the world you know I'm not wrong you know this is a house of hell you live here you know it as well as I know it rampant perversion rampant horrifying almost Indescribable sin and low down living the most corrupted agenda not only political but religious and Society with the wheels coming off you know I'm not wrong friends you walk these streets just like me you read these quotes just like me you hear Brother Branham tell about these things and when he was telling it there was still some semblance of godliness in the world you know what it has stooped to over these last 60 or so years it has become what was only a very short time ago unimaginably bad we all knew it was Sodom we all knew it was Kamar we all knew the days of Noah oh yes married and given in marriage and and and and perverted yeah we knew that but somehow I I at least I I know it's not just me I know it's all of us we would have never dreamed that the world could get to the place and I'm here to tell you something it's not finished getting bad foreign it's getting worse and worse and worse head spout now eyes closed listen dad listen mom maybe you're here in the building maybe you're streaming I hope you're doing one of the two I hope there's a church in your home if Spurgeon knew that under the man age under the age of sanctification when the whole world was mostly Godly and Spurgeon knew then that everybody better have a home a church in their home where there's active worship and active distribution of the word of God and a Heavenly order set to things what is it now parents think about it teenager you were there this weekend you made those pledges to the Lord you talked to God you were under the anointing are you following through I there were so many that came and and they they were they had such Faith to believe yes I've got this problem but I'm I'm leaving it here tonight I'm not taking it with me right here I'm laying it on the alternate you don't know how comforting it was to know that a prophet said you bring that and you lay it on this Altar and you leave it there and he said you watch the fire of God come down and consume it I'm here to tell you something friends if you lay that bondage down on the altar I don't care what's transition I don't care what's befalling you it doesn't matter where you're at right now the the house of hell to the name of Jesus God is here to secure his family for her homegoing flight God is here to equip you to equip you to reach out to your lost loved ones you have that power don't don't don't waste it you have more Authority than you realize I know sometimes in our loved ones it can look very bad but don't you underestimate the power of God don't limit the god of Israel God told warned Israel don't limit the god of Israel whatever you do don't put limits on him oh believe for anything believe for everything believe whatever you need and that is in the word of God that's according to God's purpose you can believe it right now and God will be obligated to bring it to pass yeah Hallelujah you believe that let me see hands go up if you believe that right now say I believe it right now I believe that the power of God is real and it's alive in our hearts and Minds oh Lord Jesus I pray Lord God for the listening audience Lord whether here physically or across the airwaves Lord I
