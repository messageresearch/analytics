TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] even though i'm leaving this afternoon for byc it's good to be back for a little bit wish i was back for longer let's uh let's stand up and pray heavenly father we just come before you now lord and we want your name to be lifted up and glorified lord you're doing a mighty work on this earth lord to find that last predestinated seed and to bring each one of those seed to the place of perfection lord and maturity ready for the rapture lord lord our desires just to be a part of that to walk and live in submission to you for your glory we ask these things in jesus name amen god bless you can be seated this thing working all right so we wanted to start out with reading a few quotes for brother branham i was uh sometimes it gets discouraging when you're doing missions in amongst muslims and you see my goodness well you know you go to africa and there's great huge results and your things are constantly flowing and you go to the middle east and you're like this is a little boring but but there's a reason for that you see what brother branham said and actually i i knew he said it in the church ages book as i began to search about this he says it quite a number of times in quite a number of different ways and refers to this story it had a great impact in his mind and brother branham says and so i met one missionary he said think of it brother branham i've been here 30 years and i got one precious jewel i said what's that i want a to christianity that's really something for a missionary to win a to christianity amen it really is something and then in el shaddai brother ben says the lord willing hope to be in south africa this year with brother david and another big campaign or i think that the queen campaign and that i ever held for the lord was there where 30 000 raw heathens accepted jesus christ his personal savior one afternoon thirty thousand tagged raw heathens blanket natives and never had heard the name of jesus before as far as i know now there wasn't all natives some of them they claimed about ten thousand mohammedans see was in that group my now talking to a missionary years ago and he was talking about that one precious jewel he'd been in the missions field for so many years and had won one muhammadin they're the hardest there there is to win because they're from the old medes of persian that alter not and their religion is tops and they say it's the best and you just can't change them but when you see where i think we've made our mistake we haven't did as jesus commanded us to do see see we've went and made churches and had denominations and at schools that's all right but jesus never exactly commissioned his church to do that it was to preach the gospel seal see heal the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers that's the commission see and we've done other things besides that and that's the reason the gospel hasn't gone out the way it has back to the general orders brethren that's right back to the order and so looking at these things that brother branham is speaking about here is a very true statement and historically very accurate through history so if you're familiar at all with history islam came in the seventh century and began to spread through uh saudi the the arabian tribes in through northern africa and then and then it went uh east going towards india and so you know different places had different uh ways that they received it but basically they it all it came to each of these places by the edge of the sword and by force and so that's that's kind of beside the point but it's also part of the part of the whole picture is that each of these areas through the force of an army became muslims and so islam is a very much a political religion it's not a separation of church and state you know that would be a natural understanding for most christians that are bible believers maybe not catholics but that are bible believers so we see our faith and the government as as something that the government shouldn't be trying to press pass over here to keep away though people of faith can be involved in in government and you know we should vote in different things and be involved in in the world that we live in but not a part of it and so the that's important but in islam there's not a divide like that and so and any political problems that we've faced and wars we've faced in islamic countries is because of this two worlds are colliding that don't look at the situation exactly the same when a muslim looks at an american he says that he's a christian an american looks at an american he says i mean he might be a christian but he's probably not more than likely right so there's there's a big difference and and then the mind of even an evangelical christian they they view those things as separate and they see those things that separate to a muslim their religion is equally political as as it is a religion and so government government's job in the mind of islam is to enforce islam and block anything else from going there so if that that's basically the that's the heartbeat of islam so a missionary goes there he's not only a religious threat he's a political threat and that's the reason why it's not a simple thing number one is you go through history i don't you can't think of many islamic missionaries that literally survived doing what they did because it's not possible it doesn't happen now brother branham's talking about a missionary to muslims in south africa and that being very much a minority of people that are muslims in south africa and the government at that time being controlled by i think it was the dutch uh the afrikaans so reaching out to muslims was no issue and no problem and in fact you would probably be defended by the government if a muslim were to raise up and come against that said missionary so again the situation is quite different there in south africa and nevertheless they could only win one over 30 years brother branham there in the in in his meeting put jesus christ on display and putting jesus christ on display to them they saw something real they saw the life of christ in action that was quite different than trying to teach them theology they have they have ev the islam is literally set up step by step to combat the theology of christianity number one is they believe that christians are polytheists they believe in three gods father son and holy ghost they three persons there's three gods so a that's that setup there b the bible is corrupt the the the new testament is corrupted you can't trust it so quote to a muslim that that the bible from the new testament they say well the gospel of jesus is correct but you have the false gospel yours is wrong well jesus died on the cross for your sins no he didn't die on the cross he was replaced by judas and jesus went away and fled and was caught up to god but judas they god deceived the people they thought they were killing jesus but they were killing judas and so you go step by step g well jesus is this is the virgin born son of god they say sure he's virgin born and he was sinless and he was a prophet and he's the messiah but he's not the son of god that's blasphemy so you see islam you don't just come and preach islam and they say i don't know anything about jesus say we believe in jesus he's a prophet he's the messiah he's coming back again to rule over the world so what's what do you what what what's different here a lot a huge amount is different the whole picture is different but they have something there they have theology that they know very well and if if a muslim knows anything about god they know he's one and they know these tenets to battle against christianity so the minute you go and just preach theology to them they're not interested they're not interested especially in um especially in states that are uh under the sunni religion and i'll share a minute the reason for that but under sunni islam all of these places have come to the point where you cannot be if you're turkish it means you're muslim if you're not a muslim you can't be turkish and they they have a whole tribal thing that's behind that that you literally you better just run if you become a christian just go you can't stay there you can't be around your family because rule number one if you have someone that converts in islam in your family you should kill them that's rule number one every everyone knows that you're bringing a shame on our family and you're bringing a shame on the tribe and if they don't kill them the tribe will come after that family to kill them so there's a whole thing that's whether that's be afghanistan egypt turkey saudi arabia pakistan etc you'll find that if you study and look that's exactly what happens not only will they typically kill the person who is converted they will track down the person that led them to christ and seek to kill them that's just how it works that's their that's their process every the the devil has trained them all extremely well they know this this is how they operate this is how they act and nobody questions that at all but but brother branham talks about the the persians they have a different background now uh they're they're called they're under the uh sect of islam called shia and the sunni uh they consider shia to be heretics and the reason for that is because they have they they believe in saints so their their mullahs are like people that they can somewhat pray to they believe that uh that one of the the 12th imam from a thousand years ago he he died but then resurrected and that he's invisibly working in the world now and that one day he will return again with jesus to set up the muslim kingdom on earth so that's that's what that's considered a twelver shia islam and that's what they believe and that's the state religion inside of iran and so because iranians have a rich history and it's been very well preserved a lot of these other countries their history is there but not preserved and not very well known for them their history started with islam and so beyond that they're not sure what happened you know minus perhaps egypt would be different but in in their minds in their minds islam is also their nationality directly connected to their nationality but with iranians for some reason it's not so they believe that they can be iranians and be muslims zaro austrians baha'i christian and it doesn't impact on whether they're still iranians and their their families this is not across the board because if they're they're a part of the twelver cult that controls the country they do act like other countries but the average person in the populace doesn't so in fact the conditions are such that if someone becomes a christian in iran they're often looked at as you're very brave almost heroic in a sense by their family and those around them they might be nervous for sure they'll be nervous what's going to happen because if you you know in in america your id does it say what religion is on it no if you go get a job do they say what religion are you from no in fact they're not allowed to do that here but in iran your id says your religion if you're born a muslim you can't become a christian right so you in other words you can't change your identification and your your name would reflect an islam 99 of the time would reflect an islamic name in the persian language so you have you have iranians who become christians now they go to apply for a job and now they have to say am i going to deny the son of man before men in order to get a job or am i going to be be honest and truthful and declare that i'm a christian and they they're honest and truthful they declare that they're a christian and they don't have a job and then they go to another place and they don't have a job and this is very typical or they say well i have to live i have to eat so let me just lie about this which is a good situat both situations are terrible and impossible so you're you're just to live just to function just to buy a vehicle just to do anything in iran you have that problem but nevertheless with that being said is people are coming to christ in iran now again thank the lord definitely again but that's different than being born again of the spirit of god because you have to understand life is miserable in iran and has been miserable in iran why has it been miserable in iran because of the twelver cult that controls the country it's a religion so the people's hatred for their government equals hatred for what islam so everybody has satellite television there and all there's all kinds of ministries that are putting satellite television into into iran and millions of iranians are coming to christ i haven't heard lately what it is but it's as far as in the world people coming to christ there's nowhere that's experiencing more growth in christianity than inside of iran it's not even close it's exponent it's almost exponential and the government has a great fear and they go to great lengths to try to prevent that gasoline on the fire and again i'm i'm telling you that probably the majority of these conversions are simply someone saying i am sick of islam i want to be a christian that's not being born again at all i i thank the lord i'm glad they're they're changing their religion that's a good thing and yet that's not that's not a real birth and that's what we're experiencing and seeing amongst iranians in turkey when when we get there and uh meet with them that's the first thing that we do is begin to declare the gospel serpent seed the purpose of the blood of christ and that's what myself the brothers that we're working with are doing constantly and consistently because that's that's the great need is to get people really get people to christ like brother branham said i'm afraid in our churches we're not getting people to christ we're not getting them to a true transform transformative conversion and so this is the situation that we're facing the lord is moving amongst iranians it's what brother branham's talking about here definitely what i'm seeing and amongst turkish people you know we've witnessed the turkish people shared the gospel with turkish people myself the team and when they've accepted the gospel it's not within weeks it's within weeks that they vanish we've never hear from them again and you try to track them down and maybe it's somebody you see one of these brothers they see in the city all the time all of a sudden they're gone so we don't know what's happening to them we really have no clue whether they're leaving the country or getting killed we have no idea so that's the situation amongst sunni turkish people but with iranians it's it's another thing and they're sharing the gospel with them they're immediately ready to receive it and accept it but that's again it's different than really having an experience of god that leads you into all truth has to start there right but i can't stop there and i'm i've got five minutes left and i haven't even showed any of the pictures i'll go fast so um i started out my trip went went to kaiseri met up with brother nehemiah in the airport in istanbul we went to city of chrysler where we held ministers meetings there and held two services each day and there was three of us ministering there this is the uh i'm changing it on my ipad not up there you can't see that there's the flight from charleston over to kaiseri yeah oh my is right still feeling it there's a group of believers that met us in the hotel to greet us and brought us flowers it's always weird um uh but wonderful to see them and been been a long time that's the big mountain there in the city of kaiser mount ergies it's the old city wall this was uh it's called kaiseri because it was originally originally under the roman empire not caesarea philippi not that but another another town named after caesarea after the caesar so it's the old city wall i think those are like a couple thousand years old some of the brothers there um i preached on the marriage of the lamb with them and the seventh seal and then i preached on overcoming depression in the minister's meeting the believers the local believers in the church were also allowed to come to the services as well any time you have an iranian service after the service you have to go into the fellowship area and drink tea it's required some of the food there brother brad you got to come with me and experience it kebabs is the main thing you eat in turkey it's we're spoiled for sure there with brother nehemiah is the bald one there he's the one i've been working with since 2009 before he even left iran and then brother shaheen is the one on the same side of the table with me he's the pastor in the city of denisley brother o'mead is on the far left he's the pastor in kaiseri he's he's had his we've prayed for him in the past he's the one that's had his refugee case canceled there and was in danger of deportation brother nehemiah goes to a church in in toronto area that was able to sponsor him and so uh within the next i think in the month of august he'll be going to canada with his family so that's his wife there on the right side sister sana's then i flew from kaiseri back to istanbul actually and then to cairo and we handed out book four five and six of supernatural series to group of believers there ministered on the coming of the son of man to them and the marriage of the lamb that's brother megaly the pastor there they do church a little differently they they um they have children's church while the adults are having church the children have church so there's like it's it's so funny there's the families are just huge so in the church you have like spread out maybe 25 30 people then outside you have like 60 kids running around so um i got a testimony this is how it usually happens in in egypt as i get all the testimonies from the last trip when i come back on this trip and one of the brothers came up and told me he'd been suffering from chronic back pain kind of must have been sciatica because the way he's describing it and had that for years and the last triple zero was that september we had a prayer line and he came in it and that the lord healed him of that he hasn't suffered from it since then i went up to norway i'm just going to go quickly because this this was that looks like northern minnesota it was it was incredible to see how how similar it was and how the similar the people talked you guys make fun of us the way we talk but now i know why so food is so similar to what i grew up with i had to laugh when they brought out the food because i was like yeah my mom made that exact meal all kinds of scandinavians in minnesota and no that's not raw that's smoked salmon there's some of the pictures going across the fjord and brother in the middle is brother kittle kittleson i think some people know about him um i might post his testimony he he actually from uh he played i think bass guitar in a death metal band back in the 80s and 90s late late 80s early 90s and was witnessed to by a guy brought to a bible study in his town that brother perry johansen was leading and and didn't want to go but was basically dragged there and came in with long hair and earrings and couldn't finish a sentence without swearing and the lord really touched his life completely changed it completely delivered him he quit the metal band and and uh he's married now he's got a couple sets of twins he's a wonderful brother and then on the far right is brother sven eric peterson and he's a pastor in sarpsberg really fine brother some more pictures of the beautiful countryside and i think that's about it oh there's uh that's brother john hanson he's the assistant pastor there in the church in strange pronunciation it's spelled skeen s-k-i-e-n this is how it's pronounced show on i don't know how they got that but they did and i had a wonderful time of fellowship there and and uh brother pair johansson is the pastor he's 87 years old and he came to the message in 1968 so i believe brother jason and brother matt have been there and ministered for their immediate annual meetings in youth camp and um i think that's where brother jason met brother abraham for the first time so amen let's stand and pray gracious father we come to you now lord and we're so thankful for your mercy and your grace lord we we just ask that your holy spirit be upon each one lord that you would bless the service bless the bless the music as we worship you lord may you be glorified may we get get our
