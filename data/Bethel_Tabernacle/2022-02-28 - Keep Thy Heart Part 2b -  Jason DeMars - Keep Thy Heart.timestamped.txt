[0:00] god
[0:00] mr wesley spent two hours daily in
[0:03] prairie began at four in the morning of
[0:05] him one who knew him well wrote he
[0:06] thought prayer to be more his business
[0:08] than anything else
[0:10] and i've seen him come out of his closet
[0:12] with the serenity of faith next to
[0:13] shining
[0:14] john fletcher stained the wall john
[0:16] fletcher was kind of the after wesley
[0:19] went off the scene john fletcher was
[0:21] actually his secretary and he kind of
[0:23] carried the mantle forward after he went
[0:26] off the scene john fletcher stained the
[0:27] walls of his room by the breath of his
[0:29] prayer sometimes he would pray all night
[0:31] always frequently and with great
[0:33] earnestness his whole life was a life of
[0:35] prayer i would not rise from my seat he
[0:37] said without lifting my heart to god
[0:40] his greeting to a friend was always do i
[0:42] meet you praying
[0:44] luther said if i fail to spend two hours
[0:46] in prayer each morning the devil gets
[0:47] the victory through the day
[0:49] i have so much business i cannot get on
[0:51] without spending three hours daily in
[0:54] prayer
[0:55] he had a motto he that has prayed well
[0:57] has studied well amen
[1:02] that that's a great way of thinking
[1:04] we think
[1:06] i've got so much to do today i can't
[1:08] spend time in prayer but luther was like
[1:10] well
[1:11] i've got so much to do i better increase
[1:14] my time of prayer so that i can get it
[1:16] all done
[1:17] that's the right way of that's the
[1:19] biblical way of thinking
[1:24] mark 11 24
[1:26] i think this goes to the heart of the
[1:28] matter
[1:29] therefore i say unto you what things
[1:32] soever you desire
[1:33] when you pray believe that you receive
[1:36] them and you shall have them
[1:39] why does it go to the heart of the
[1:40] matter
[1:44] it's what you desire
[1:46] and that is what comes from the heart
[1:49] if you desire worldly things you're
[1:50] going to seek after worldly things
[1:53] if you desire heavenly things
[1:55] you'll seek after heavenly things
[1:57] so
[1:58] your desire
[1:59] needs to change if your if your mind is
[2:02] on earthly things it means you need to
[2:04] ask the lord
[2:05] touch the desires that i have in my
[2:07] heart because they're not they're not
[2:09] going in the right direction i need them
[2:11] to go in the right direction
[2:13] prayer starts with desire
[2:16] it's as simple as that
[2:18] god place there's a desire in your heart
[2:21] what should your response be i'm going
[2:23] to go solve the problem pray
[2:26] that's our first reaction that's our
[2:28] first
[2:30] thing that we should do when a desire
[2:32] hits our heart
[2:34] begin to pray whatever you desire
[2:36] when you pray all right so that's the
[2:38] start
[2:39] desire
[2:41] births prayer
[2:43] then then what do we do next believe
[2:46] if you look at the
[2:49] english standard version here it says
[2:52] believe that you have
[2:54] received it
[2:56] so the tense is past tense so you you
[2:58] desire it you pray and then what do you
[3:00] do you believe i've already got it
[3:02] it's already mine
[3:04] it's already the promise is there so
[3:06] it's just as good as mine
[3:08] if you do that then it'll be yours
[3:10] but if you pray and you're just mumbling
[3:13] words
[3:14] and you're just saying what you think
[3:15] you ought to say with no desire behind
[3:17] it
[3:18] you're got it out of order
[3:20] if your desire is wrong then you've got
[3:22] to pray lord
[3:24] fix this
[3:26] my weak desires
[3:27] i'm instead of seeking after the great
[3:30] things which are heavenly things i'm
[3:33] seeking after
[3:35] mud and filth and garbage
[3:37] that's what the things of the world are
[3:40] you know it's not it's not that our when
[3:42] we seek after the things of the world
[3:43] it's not that our desires are
[3:46] are are too strong it's that they're too
[3:48] weak
[3:49] we're going after the things that
[3:51] provide no satisfaction no happiness no
[3:54] nothing good in your life
[3:56] if our desire was strong enough we'd be
[3:59] seeking after eternal things
[4:02] we'd be looking after eternal things
[4:03] we'd have an eternal vision
[4:05] instead of an earthly vision the things
[4:08] that you want god's vision is eternal
[4:10] when he says i'm going to work
[4:11] everything out for good that doesn't
[4:13] mean you're going to have a mansion and
[4:15] a lamborghini
[4:18] or a ps5 or whatever your desire
[4:22] is for the nicest computer the nicest
[4:24] this the nicest that
[4:26] no it's it's something completely
[4:29] different that god is trying to do in
[4:31] our life it's eternal good
[4:34] that's why we that's why we go through
[4:36] suffering now
[4:38] because god is seeking our eternal good
[4:40] you say oh that's how can suffering be
[4:42] good well the only reason you say that
[4:45] is because you don't have the mind of
[4:47] christ if you had the mind of christ
[4:48] you'd know
[4:49] that the things that we suffer and
[4:51] struggle with and the trials that we
[4:53] face
[4:54] are working something in us
[4:56] an eternal weight of glory
[4:59] something that will never fade that will
[5:01] never fail
[5:03] you know these
[5:04] paul says these momentary
[5:06] light if afflictions i mean look what
[5:09] paul was going through
[5:11] we we probably wouldn't say they were
[5:12] momentary or light
[5:15] but paul with the eyes of eternity said
[5:18] these momentary light afflictions are
[5:20] working
[5:21] for me an eternal
[5:23] weight of glory
[5:27] i don't want to get sidetracked by that
[5:28] thought but i'm just feeling
[5:30] inspired by that
[5:34] in other words the things that you're
[5:36] going through right now the suffering
[5:38] that you're experiencing now
[5:40] has eternal value you know in other
[5:42] words the the
[5:43] even the smallest thing that you suffer
[5:45] for the sake of the gospel
[5:48] god is watching that and you going
[5:51] through that with faith
[5:53] and love in your heart
[5:55] there is a reward
[5:56] for going through that
[5:58] it's creating it's creating something
[6:02] it's you know brother branham talks
[6:03] about the theophany creating the vi
[6:05] the take feeding on the word creates the
[6:07] vitamins
[6:08] for that theophany body it's building a
[6:10] body
[6:11] the suffering that we go through
[6:14] is creating a particular
[6:17] a peculiar glory
[6:19] that's specifically yours
[6:21] in eternity
[6:23] so a specific reward a specific thing so
[6:27] we shouldn't look at well i'm suffering
[6:29] i'm having trials i went through this
[6:30] thing how terrible
[6:32] god sees
[6:34] he knows exactly what you've gone
[6:36] through
[6:37] and
[6:38] when you go through it with faith there
[6:40] is an eternal reward
[6:43] let's
[6:44] lord help us to think
[6:47] with eternity in mind
[6:49] not be so short-sighted so limited to
[6:52] here we're gonna if we're gonna be
[6:54] closer over there
[6:56] than we are here
[6:57] then we i think we need to start
[6:58] thinking
[6:59] more
[7:00] eternal thoughts
[7:09] i'm going to skip a few things here
[7:14] brother branham says in the angel in the
[7:16] commission
[7:18] night time when all demon powers shut
[7:20] down towards mourning when they're not
[7:21] roaming that's the time the holy spirit
[7:24] moves in and talks to me
[7:26] go early if you want to pray rise up
[7:29] early
[7:30] that's scriptural
[7:32] read psalm 63
[7:34] david says he rose up early and sought
[7:37] after god if you're not a morning person
[7:40] i i have become not a morning person i
[7:43] need to
[7:44] change that and become a morning person
[7:46] again
[7:47] so that i can have those morning hours
[7:49] with the lord
[7:51] i mean if brother branham says that the
[7:52] demon power shut down i mean you know
[7:54] that if you get up early
[7:56] get your cup of coffee at least for me
[7:58] first
[7:58] and now you can think clearly there's
[8:00] such a
[8:01] there's such a peace and a uh there's a
[8:03] peacefulness and a quiet
[8:05] that comes in the morning why is it
[8:07] because brother madam said the demon
[8:09] power is shut down towards what there's
[8:10] nothing to work through
[8:12] there's there's no they can't work
[8:13] through anything so now you can get up
[8:15] and
[8:16] quickly feel the presence of the lord in
[8:18] your prayer closet
[8:22] embounds in power through prayer says to
[8:24] pray is the greatest thing we can do
[8:27] and to do it well there must be calmness
[8:30] time and deliberation otherwise it is
[8:32] great degraded into the littlest and
[8:34] meanest of things
[8:36] true praying has the largest results for
[8:38] good and poor praying
[8:40] the least
[8:42] we cannot do too much of the re of real
[8:44] praying we cannot do too little of the
[8:46] sham
[8:47] we must learn a new the wondrous art we
[8:49] must not give a fragment here in a
[8:51] fragment there a little talk with jesus
[8:54] as the tiny saints sing but we must
[8:56] demand
[8:57] and hold with iron grasp the best hours
[8:59] of the day for god in prayer or there
[9:02] will be no praying worth the name
[9:07] i think we miss we miss the power
[9:10] that we have through prayer we want to
[9:12] change things with our actions
[9:15] we see certain situations and say i
[9:16] don't like what's happening here i don't
[9:18] like what's happening there
[9:19] and then we go and try to do something
[9:21] instead of the fact that god showed us
[9:23] that
[9:24] whatever it was so that we could pray
[9:27] because when we pray you know what
[9:28] happens your heart gets right
[9:30] in the situation
[9:32] usually when you get upset and you try
[9:34] to affect a change with your words or
[9:37] your actions
[9:38] mostly it's wrong because you're wrong
[9:41] you might have been right in your
[9:43] in your judgment of the circumstances in
[9:45] the situation
[9:46] but your heart was wrong because you
[9:48] approached it because you're frustrated
[9:50] instead of praying
[9:52] that should be our very first
[9:54] thing that we do
[9:55] and that's
[9:56] the greatest thing that we can do
[10:00] um
[10:04] skip that and we'll just finish here
[10:07] brother branham says in a hidden life in
[10:09] christ but then your bedroom is your
[10:11] place of rest and after the toil of a
[10:14] weary day always alone in the room
[10:15] resting at my house the prayer room is
[10:18] the bedroom many times i've went into
[10:20] little old homes and see them mothers
[10:22] and so forth come out of the bedroom
[10:23] with a little old
[10:25] checkered apron on wiping her eyes
[10:26] crying praying secret place meeting
[10:29] place alone with god isolated oh it's a
[10:32] marvelous place to be
[10:34] amen
[10:36] may i i'm just
[10:39] my desire in speaking about this
[10:42] was one for myself
[10:45] to renew my heart and burden and passion
[10:48] for prayer
[10:50] and two just to pass that along to you
[10:52] at the same time i'm doing that
[10:54] because that's the place
[10:57] that we have power that's the place that
[11:01] us as a church will have
[11:03] impact
[11:04] on this world and for souls for christ
[11:07] is out of prayer
[11:09] it's not just taking action and planning
[11:11] the program and planning this program
[11:13] oh that's good but without prayer being
[11:16] the functional start
[11:18] of that
[11:19] it's birthed out of the wrong place
[11:21] out of the wrong motive
[11:23] prayer is where we communicate with god
[11:27] it's where we hear from god
[11:29] and god hears from us
[11:30] it's where we listen
[11:32] and he speaks to us because he wants to
[11:34] do that personally to each and every one
[11:36] of us that's not just for the preachers
[11:38] and the prophet but he will communicate
[11:41] with each of us in the way that he's
[11:43] training you and teaching you
[11:45] and so you have but you have to get
[11:46] alone with him you have to get quiet you
[11:49] have to take time you have to make a
[11:51] choice and a decision
[11:53] this is what i want to be important in
[11:55] my life
[11:56] prayer
[11:58] not all these other things and hobbies
[12:00] and all that
[12:01] but prayer should be our our most
[12:04] important feature of our life
