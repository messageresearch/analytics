and it just been raining and like the sun was coming up and so the clouds were all bright and golden and there was a giant rainbow that went all the way across the sky and it it was amazing i thought the verse first was that song and it was it was maybe it's kind of great to fall in love with the lord every morning so um let's see uh sing as we change the order of the service invite i guess brother jason's preaching tonight i think and we'll invite the pastor out and we'll sing only believe i'm feeling i like that song a lot oh [Music] are possible [Music] [Applause] all things are

smith good to see you standing up on two feet says to praise the lord happy to have him here amen god bless you all and uh i can already see that uh that's not enough light for me so we're gonna have to figure out something we needed to take those uh ceiling fans down and uh because we put new different camera angles and we couldn't see through them and so uh those cans we're gonna need something else besides that amen i'm a child of the light i like something that's light and airy and bright amen i'd rather be too bright than too dim man y'all might go to sleep on me amen i wouldn't be able to see you i think was he asleep i wouldn't know um praise the lord so um we we want to i also just want to kind of apologize for the church being half painted it's white on one side and still yellow on the other uh but we last wednesday i was here working and fell ill and uh just kind of got really what i consider fully recovered today yesterday i still felt just a little bit behind the uh just behind in my full strength but today might have just felt wonderful and so we're thanking the lord i sure want to thank all of you for your prayers and then right away i had even some fellas helping me that worked on the fellowship hall but then the rain hit so monday and tuesday we were monsoon season around here so that's what happens um you know late summer painting storms come in so we're we should have good weather thursday and friday and saturday and the plan is to get it finished up so the lord willing when you come back sunday it should all be nice and white amen and our doors came in for the front so uh brother brad is making a plan to come back down we're gonna install new doors there and get the rest of the paint scheme all worked out i love how it's turning out and then we're gonna do some landscaping and some different things like that and then um take a little bit of a breather and then we get started on the inside amen so we've got a lot that we want to do and we're kind of doing a little bit of it a little as we go but we got we don't have to be in a breakneck hurry but i mean just how it is works for us has worked for years but we've not done any serious renovations in a long time so this is the first time so i'm really excited about it and thanking the lord for it all right i'm going to invite you to numbers 13 and uh i want to get this one of these last books of moses right before deuteronomy you'll find the book of numbers and it's a wonderful book has a lot of relevance to us in our day we want to look at numbers 13. just want to take two verses people who listen to a lot of tapes will recognize this as the text brother branham took in the time of decision he preached that several times power of decision time of decision and preached it four or five times it was an important topic to him amen a lot of decisions to be made in life today life comes at you quick and there's a lot of decisions that have to be made and are being made and we want to make sure that you know that we're making the right ones and the best way to do that is to you know see the whole see the whole field see see everything and uh look at it uh in its entirety and i think that god has given us a wonderful reality in this day um you know where we have uh literally come to the end of not knowing amen the seals have been opened the book is opened that we know now we know so many things that they wondered at through the ages and we don't have to wonder at them anymore we've had the original understanding restored back to us so thanks be to god numbers 13 and we're just going to catch two verses verse 30 and verse 31. and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it verse 31 but the men that were that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we amen let's pray father i thank you for your word this evening lord we are asking you to come now and just break the bread of life to us i have so enjoyed studying this sermon lord i've so looked forward to this moment to walk out here to this sacred desk speak to these lovely people who i love with such a great love help us now master lord if there's any others coming we know bad weather is trying to sweep through so we just pray for everyone's safety and lord we thank you now for your great grace to us we committed all to you in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated praise the lord all right so uh brothers if you will give me my powerpoint please and we'll put the oh there we go and uh get some i'll turn it off and turn it back on i must have left it on last time um amen we've got a number of prayer requests we'll get to here shortly but we want to get right into the word today um and we want to come to this thought finding god's current and i'm taking for a subtitle i think i hit this one the power of decision finding god's current now what i mean by god's current okay i want you to think about currents in the ocean you know there's currents in the jet stream and uh you know there it's it's not easy to swim against the current amen and you know there is a there is a uh a way the bible says that seemeth right to a man i could say it to you tonight there is a current that seems like the way to swim but the end thereof is is destruction there is there is what seems to be the right current i i think i'm in the i've got a nice tailwind i'm going good i've got a nice career i've got a nice job a lot of people like me things are going good that don't necessarily mean that you have found god's current because i want you to get this in your mind right from the very beginning there is a there is a current that that men purport to be the way to go but then there's a current that god has and i want you to know some friends when you really get into and you know uh pilots will tell you this and swimmers will tell you this that when you when you really get into the current i mean and just let it take you and you know there's every pilot loves a good tailwind because i remember i remember when we were when i was lifting off out of lax and i was flying to the philippines on one of my um teeth trips there i don't remember which one it was and i'm on a big jumbo 747 and uh we're we're taking off and we get about midway over the pacific which makes the atlantic look like a pond that's why they call it the pond and and all of a sudden the lights all come on i'm sleeping i'm asleep and the lights all come on let's prepare for landing and i'm like landing what how are we where are we landing we're supposed to be headed to you know hawaii and then one stop in hawaii and i said we can't possibly be at honolulu already and uh and so the stewardess comes by i said excuse me miss our flight attendant i think is how they like to be called and i said excuse me miss and she said yes and i said i said we're we're stopping i said but i looked on my schedule i said where are we landing she said we're landing in guam i said in guam the u.s territory she goes yes i said you know there's nothing but like an airfield there it's a military base she goes yeah we gotta land there and i said why are we making an unscheduled stop and she just looked at me and said we're out of gas and i went good answer okay we should land and i said well why why is it not in this he said well the captain called us all forward and said hey we got to make an unscheduled stop because the from the moment we lifted up out of lax he he flew straight into a headwind that was severe and he had to hit the hit the throttles and he burned up all of our gas just trying to get there i was glad he was there i was glad because over the pacific just a little bitty dot and uh i was glad it was there uh but you know it it you know i i've taken trips before where you know you went to a location and it took this many hours and coming back it seemed like wow we got back a lot quicker and i've inquired hey how do we get back so quick i said oh the pilot said we caught a good tailwind and we we were able to fly faster or however it was they did it and and so there's something to finding god's current for your life i want to encourage you tonight to look for it and when you and when you i want to encourage you tonight to want it see now god's current might be different than yours god's current might be a crosswind to your plan but i want to encourage you tonight say what should i do if i find myself in that situation abandon your plan amen abandon your plan find god's current when i when i read this story of the children of israel like kadesh barnea this is uh an epic moment in jewish history it's it's a seminal moment it's uh it's it's almost can't be overstated because this is where this right here is where brother branham said israel made its most irrational decision he called it a rational choice in his kentucky english this is where the decision that they made literally cost them everything yeah amen that they would wonder in the wilderness for 40 more years on a journey that should have only taken a few days you can't get a more epic moment a more epic fail for israel than right here on a text we read tonight so i i use this text quite on purpose not only because it's brother branham's text for time of decision and power of decision there's a lot of power in your decisions and you need to think about your decisions and when i read this story i see two groups interestingly two groups using the same word we caleb still the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it and and uh another group right standing there goes to the same church caleb goes follows the same prophet caleb follows says we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we so when i read this story i see two groups using this same word we but with very different perspectives because kayla and caleb and joshua of course were the spies who brought back the faithful report that with that with the lord's help canaan could easily be taken amen see and so it seems clear to me that when the spies who gave the unfaithful report that they are stronger than we and we are not able to do it they were showing that they had no thought of god being in their we right right amen god wasn't in their we you get the difference with caleb and joshua they knew they had no power to do that but they said but what their message was with god's help in fact is caleb caleb later comes down in the 14th chapter and says if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us see and so this is the all too familiar example of people who have oh my who have seen god do such great things i mean was there anybody that you could you imagine anybody in the bible that you could read about as the children of israel who saw more of the supernatural just look what they saw in egypt amen while they were there i mean the flies the frogs the darkness the blood and the water i mean the hail with fire mingled in it and then and while all of egypt was in darkness they were in light and while all the firstborn of egypt was dying not just first-born children firstborn dogs and cats and cows but all of israel was safe you talking about and then that they were brought out of a superpower who couldn't stop them and then they then they watched god deliver them and and part the red sea when you see that you know on the evening news yeah amen the sea parts and they didn't slosh across through mud they walked on dry ground and they say well yeah they said i was a sea of reeds brother brandon said how what a ridiculous thing how did the seer reach then drown the egyptian army trying to follow them and they literally watched all of that take place this is such a classic too familiar as i said it's a two familiar example of people who have seen god do such great things yet remain forever unspiritual amen living out their lives in lukewarm experience that won't save them in the end right amen amen for their faithfulness god allowed caleb and and and and joshua for their faithfulness god allowed them to survive the wilderness experience and enter into canaan you find on down in the 14th chapter if you go all the way to the 26th chapter we're not doing it tonight but when they when moses takes the second census in in numbers 26 that actually caleb and joshua were the only ones from the original group that were even still alive that decision that they had about the word preserved their lives unto canaan's land oh i want something to preserve my life till i get to canaan's land see and so after the major campaigns of the conquest were completed then joshua actually divided the land of canaan by lot the lord told him to do that you'll divide it by lot but in keeping with god's promise which had been 45 years earlier caleb actually was the very first one to be given his land and he was given that land he was allotted hebron near the cave of mach pilar uh where the patriarchs that was where the patriarchs that's where abraham buried sarah that's where all the patriarchs were buried i thought to myself i want to be buried where the early church fathers were buried wherever they buried in christ hallelujah i want to make the same choices of the word so that i can be buried by the same place that my church fathers were buried because i've been restored to their faith and i want to be able to live where they now live amen see and so it comes down to focusing on the word in our lives so that because listen friends and this is a very important point i i i read this this little snippet of a quote here and i'm not gonna i don't have it on the display i'm just gonna read it for you brother branham takes from the message look in 1963 this is just a few weeks after he finished preaching the opening of the seals and brother branham says speaking of christ how that he was the word there you are see so he he comes to an audience and he says what are you looking at see what now you say well we're looking at this yeah but what do you see what do you see when you look at god's word do you what do you see when you open up a message book what do you see what do you hear when i say god sent a prophet do you just hear doctrine do you just hear an idea do you hear philosophy some too many people today even said in message churches and they're not even as sure as they used to be right amen and to which i say that's about as bad as you can possibly be because if you don't if this message isn't it then i don't know of anything else close to it and and i'm saying how am i getting home how am i getting out of here hallelujah i'm here to tell you friends we have not followed cunningly devised tales and god still moves and god is still proving and vindicating his word in our lives keeping you sane in an insane world or to be proof enough keeping you right side up in an upside down world or to be proof enough but remember the idea is not about agreement with doctrine that's because the devil agrees with doctrine this says that that god is and the devil believes that see and he actually fears and trembles at the very name of jesus christ that doesn't make him a believer so it's not just about believing that it's accurate or believing that it's true brother branham says when you recognize he was the word there you are then you now watch because this is a procedure you got to go through the motions of this then you and the word are focused in together you become you become something something more than you are that's why the message came to make you something more than you are one of these days i'm going to be a glorified me that's going to be quite a bit more than i am right now but i'll never get that outside unless i have it on the inside you'll never i promise you the message of the hour is revelation 18 4 come out of her amen i like how brother jack duff says it he says that if you want to hear the sound if you want to hear the call come up you better hear the call come out because if you don't come out you'll never go up you've got to first hear come out and then you can hear come up hallelujah you become a living unit of god so so it's to focus on the word so that our life so that our life our life and the word become one amen so that you become a living unit of the word you become the living word you see amen so so brother brandon says you become a living unit of god that's that's a lot more than just believing doctrinal teaching there's doctrinal teaching we don't even fully understand but that's not going to stop me from becoming a living unit see i've occasionally been wrong on my doctrinal understanding but that didn't stop me from becoming a living unit see enoch brother enoch enoch built one of the seven wonders of the ancient world in the great pyramid of giza it's interesting because the turns and the cuts that he made are literally baffling to science to this day i i've seen enough uh highly acclaimed documentaries oh i know that the version they tell us in school you know they want you to believe somehow they had millions of slaves using logs and long ramps that were a mile long and somehow they rolled those stones up there and i i just not too long ago saw right on national geographic or pbs one of them and a new scientist went through there and he said he said that how they got these stones in place is just one little small piece he said let me take you on a trip and he said look at these cuts and turns and sm and walls he said there was no there wasn't even a tool in existence back then that could make this kind of a cut or this kind of a turn or this kind of an arch he said it wouldn't have done any good to have 10 million slaves trying to do it they didn't have the possibility to do it and they pulled stones weighing so many tons and hauled them for hundreds of miles out of out of quarries that were hundreds of miles away and he said to hawaii the whole idea that he said i'm here and they finally asked him well how did they build it he said they had a power we don't understand amen i said that's a very that's a very good doctrine it's about 50 60 years too late prophet already told us that in the 1950s but enoch built one of the seven wonders of the ancient world and his turns and his cuts and the things that he was able to do baffling science and how it aligns with the stars so perfectly seven steps to the king's chamber on and on and on and on it goes we're not here to preach pyramid teaching tonight but we found that it was god's actually god's second bible and the first one was written in the stars in the zodiac and so and and and that pyramid now of course the pyramid while it was god's second bible overall was actually the first one ever assembled in the earth see that was a that was a bible yeah and and and the the and and it's in harmony with the heavenly bible i mean how did how did that happen yeah see and so so we find that that enoch of course according to to the bible that there's none good no not one and none of us are good paul said we're all open sepulchers we're all dead men see there's only one good one and that was god and that was in christ there's only one perfect man even elijah had his ups and downs according to the scripture according to a prophet he was a man of like passions brother rem said it mean he had his ups and downs so we find that there was no perfect man uh you could find the bible talking about job perfect in all of his ways uh but yet still we found that un when put when pressure come job had wrong thinking and god had to absolutely actually openly rebuke job for his thinking and and so so we we realized that enoch would not have been a perfect man but his faith his revelation of the revealed word was perfect and you actually can see his perfect faith because it manifested itself he literally built the image of the word in the pyramid amen amen so you understand that that pyramid was an expression of his of his vision of his revelation of his faith and what he built was perfect just like the stars were perfect the pyramid was perfect this is perfect amen you understand here it is all these different books with all these different authors over all these thousands of years and yet it all perfectly there's not a single contradiction in it and and people don't understand it neither do they understand the second bible or his first bible they don't understand the bible living in skin right here in you and i see they didn't understand it in a lowly nazarene they didn't know that was the word living in skin amen it looked too simple for them he's a carpenter's son we know his mother and father we i saw the manger he was born and i saw the cradle he was rocked in remember i preached here last time there's sometimes you have to first unseed to see you've got to unsee a lot of man-made tradition if you want to see the revealed word of the hour you got to unsee some of your own training and your own raising and your own your own social uh socialization if you want to see the power of god how many want to see the power of god in their lives and so we find that that he literally built the image we talk a lot about perfect faith coming at the end time but i want you to know something friends perfect faith is here now quit putting it off to never neverland somewhere over a rainbow we're going to get perfect faith i'm here to tell you it's here now and it's a perfect faith and a perfectly revealed word and i got it hallelujah say brother jason how do you know that you have perfect faith in the revealed word because it still builds wonders over the world hallelujah it still builds humble god-fearing people they don't know how you make those turns in your life that you do just like they couldn't figure out the turns and cuts and and things that enoch did they don't know how you make the turns you do and turning turning from sin they don't know how you turn from dishonesty before god they don't know how they you say how do you do it how do you live like that how do you live separate because i have a real experience i have a living revelation and that's perfect faith brother madam said what is the new birth it's a revelation of jesus christ personally to you how do you make those cuts we don't know how you make those cuts those clear-cut decisions for christ and his word how is it you're willing to stand apart from the world how is it that the things of the world we what do we do with things of the world we cut them free from our lives a real believer has no desire to have things of the world hanging on him if you don't if you if that's not your heart tonight then you need to get born again because i realize our flesh still lust after the things of the world that's why we bring it subject under prayer and under fellowship and under church and under the bible and under under listening to the message i'm going to tell you there's strength in that one of the things that we don't do is allow this flesh to rule the inner man i'm not here i'm not here to let the outer man run the inner man up it's the other way around for me amen so we cut them free just like enoch cut things the way that your daily life listen friends the very way that your daily life like the great pyramid rises off the earth's floor [Music] towers upward and points to the sky that's what enoch's pyramid did it literally rose up off the earth floor and it towered upward and it today stands as a marker pointing to the skies that's what brother branham said when brother branham when the spirit of god struck him and said pick up your pen and write and brother branham said i just started writing he said i didn't even know what i was writing said i had to go back and read it myself and when he when he went back to read it the lord is speaking now here's what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that and it goes on down through there and when it comes down to the end well why is that important because the law of reproduction it means seed whatever seed you plant is going to bring forth what you planted so if you sow the word in your life guess what happens to your life you become a garden of god you you literally god doesn't need to bring back the garden of eden he's got you and me to be his garden of eden hallelujah he says i am the vine my father is the husband my father is the gardener my father's the farmer he knows how to grow his crop and brother branham says there under the under the inspiration of the spirit he says just as elijah and john the baptist he says just as elijah of that day pointed to the lamb of god and screamed out to the people behold the lamb of god now you would think the next line would be so the elijah of the last day will point and say behold the lamb of god that's not what the spirit had him right the holy spirit actually had him right just as elijah in john's day pointed to christ and said behold the lamb of god he said the elijah of this day will point to a word-born bride and the word-born bride the bride of christ will be pointed to the skies just like a pyramid the bride of christ will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of jesus screaming behold the lamb of god i'm here to tell you something friends it's not all about just getting out on the street and screaming behold the lamb of god my life is a trumpeting sound my life is a screaming my life rises up off the earth with cuts and turns the world can't understand and i'm i'm i'm pointing to the sky trying to say to the world look this life i have behold the lamb of god see amen it's not yet there i mean at this point it is a fact of his it is a fact of prophecy that god sent a prophet but that's not the main scream now that's still being shouted all around the world i'm still telling everybody i can who don't know that yeah see we say well why is that still important then because that's how to how else do i get them out of the great lie how do i how do i how do i tell them about the greatest existential threat humanity faces the great lie remember to believe a lie and be damned about it remember that in the scripture and the great lie is that you just make a decision for christ and that's all you got to do and the great the what they don't know it they're blind because the bible says laodicea was blind and so the whole world according to isaiah is blind and all the people are in gross darkness and they're and what they don't know that i happen to know what they don't know is that denominationalism will lead them to the mark of the beast in the tribulation how are they going to know that if i don't tell them how are they going to know what the peace system is how are they going to know to come out of that my people otherwise you're going to go into a tribulation it doesn't matter denominationalism denominationalism is leading people to the mark of the beast and they'll have an image on the confederation of church is not going to have they already have it and that is the image to the beast in the book of revelation and the world's blind to that what do you want me to do not tell them i mean it's the greatest threat to humanity the greatest threats not global warming the greatest threats not china or iran the greatest threat is the big lie that they're all believing because the two messengers to laodicea blinded them into thinking that i'm here to tell you i got to lift up my voice and say god sent a prophet and a prophet warned us in the bible come out of that you're going to die staying in that that's the saith the lord that's the scriptures see so the way our life aligns with the same kind of harmony that they can see in the stars and see in the heavens they can see enoch's pyramid agrees with the heavens they can see this revelation fits this revelation when they see you when they engage you in conversation can they see and hear that your revelation and this revelation and that revelation is all the same revelation that's what my message to you tonight is all about you need to find god's main current for your life because his main current is that you be build it up and be pointing to the lamb of god [Music] amen where does this harmony come from where does this amen to every word come from brother branham goes into the masterpiece message and i've talked about this before it always moves me that how that when angelo broke a piece off and it flew and there's a a flaw now on the on the statue of michelangelo of moses and you know people say oh man if it just didn't have that flaw you know it could have been it could have been a greater masterpiece it's a masterpiece because you know michelangelo did it but how much greater it could have been oh if he just hadn't done that but brother branham said now to me it's just the opposite see because to a prophet that that that that there must be a piece broken off to make this the masterpiece i mean how's this the master piece unless there's another piece there's a piece flew off it goes on this masterpiece you understand so jesus said i come from god i go back to god he's god's perfect masterpiece i'm here to tell you something friends what where's that amen come from not because you were smarter where does that where does that desire in your life to to live and to have a voice of the resurrection it's not because you are smarter it's because you came from somewhere it's because you're a part of something that's greater than you it's greater and say i made a decision this is greater than any decision you ever made you didn't the bride of christ is actually the only humans in the world who don't make a decision jesus said you have not chosen me i have chosen you [Music] it's only the rest of the world who has to make that decision not me i'm part of that word i was born that way i still had to be born again so i had to have the holy ghost otherwise otherwise that that gene stays dormant and i and i my life never becomes enoch's pyramid my life never points and says behold the lamb of god amen this is why we preach this is why we're here this is why you come to church this is why we proclaim god sent a message not to make theologians out of us or to give us better theology but to make us great pyramids to make us wonders of the world see that's what it come for elisha received a double portion oh i got to hurry that was on elijah and you know it's interesting because you know just as you you really can't know the full experience everybody in here who's had children if you've you're young and you've never had children you're you're you're going to understand what i'm saying you're going to agree with it but you're not going to get it like the ones who have had children and even now grandchildren you really get it just as you can't know the full experience of having children unless you have had them see you can learn about what it means to have children you you can get a nice textbook education on how to raise them but unless you actually have the experience you'll be missing critical elements that qualify you to judge being a parent amen you're an unqualified judge of parents if you don't have children because you might have learned about it in a textbook but that's everybody in here that's had a child understands what i get we can get that with a look i just go you know yeah i get it i don't really have to explain it that when you actually have your own children there's a knowing that that is is otherworldly amen and it's you're you're ready now suddenly to give your life immediately without question hesitation to save the life of this one amen you're literally ready to to turn your life on end so that this one can now have a great life you'll do anything for your children see and so so elisha then receives a double portion in other words he he had the experience of elijah duplicated upon himself you understand so receiving the duplicated experience of the same spirit of christ that was on elijah makes only elisha in his day only elisha was qualified to judge the ministry of elijah amen he was the only one because he was the only one who had that duplicated experience you see and so so all others all others are unqualified to judge it the school of the prophets couldn't judge it they tried they got it all mixed up and got it wrong they said oh he's hiding and he's on another mountain we're gonna go find him and elisha said he won't find him he's gone oh no we'll find him we'll have search committee we we know this land like the back of our hand we'll fight him okay go ahead then they come back we couldn't find him i told you see because they didn't understand the ministry of elijah they simply did not know what his ministry they were unqualified to know what his ministry was about they simply it's not that they were bad people they simply did not have his experience they did not have elisha's same experience just as you just as you can't know the full experience of having children unless you've had them see and so so we realized that only those who actually followed elijah's ministry and have the same experience of the holy ghost can't even understand what it's all about [Music] see the born-again bride this literally means that the born-again bride is the only people in the earth who can judge this ministry of the last day see all other judgments are perfectly unqualified factually unqualified see i i've i i remember one time i had a young lady meet me in my back office and she was headed into the world i could see it she'd never had a holy ghost experience i could see it and you know she heard the same sermons as everybody else who got the experience and are faithful today but she made different choices she made a different decision she said in my office and talked to me and said that tried to explain to me that that she didn't actually believe the message and i just said to her honey i said to her because i knew her since she's a little child excuse me she's probably i met her when she was three and i said and i won't call her name but i said honey you you you don't even you don't even know what the message is you don't even know what you don't believe and i said the truth is i looked her in the eye i said the truth is you just want to go to the world the truth is you don't want to be a christian not a real one anyway see that that's the real truth see you don't want to be a real christian you want to go into the world and she admitted it was true and she did and she's there to this day and and you know because i i wasn't going to sit there and accept the excuse that she didn't believe the message she didn't even know what the message she didn't know anything about it she had never taken the time to never read a book in her life never heard a tape probably in her life except maybe what her parents were playing and she made her decision very early in life that she didn't want to be a part of that and she stuck to her guns i at least respect her for that now she's a very nice girl very good friend i still love her still pray for but but my point is that she was sitting there making an unqualified statement i don't believe it's true well you wouldn't know you wouldn't even have the mechanism to know because you yourself haven't had the same experience see and so she she didn't want to be she just didn't want to be a christian not a real one see and of course when i talk about a real christian i'm not just talking about message believers friends get that narrow-mindedness out of your out of your mind we're not just talking about message believers there are other real sincere people who live in true holiness who will actually be granted eternal life at the day of judgment and live with us in the new heavens and the new earth amen so don't think more highly of yourself so that you can't reach out to everybody amen so i'm not talking about them that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about few people in america i mean few people in america mind they don't mind at all being being a modern day one being a modern day christian see but not an authentic one not a real one there's only one kind of real one and those the bible calls them saints yes see because they're sanctified and so so we realize that that you know jesus and and here here's the thing friends that's not some invention that's not some new uh conjured up doctrine of the end time jesus told us it would be that way paul told us it would be that way especially when it came down and when it got to the end time it would actually be acute gland global it would be a critical element in the earth among christianity that's what jesus warned of that's what paul warned of so we're talking about tonight about being an authentic one that means you're an original one you know how you're an original one because you had the same experience the original church had and without that same experience you are not yet living as a child of god you're not even living at all you're still dying that's why we say you must be born again you must have the baptism of the holy ghost and that's not hard to get all it takes is a full surrender to every word and finally get rid of your thinking and just say lord come and be the lord of all my life see that's all it takes to get the baptism of the holy ghost it's not hard to get if you if you meet the condition of the word it's your promise just like it is mine the faculty of making fortunate discoveries by accident as a commonly held belief in the world have even have a fancy word for it called serendipity and they'll you know you'll hear them say well you know this person met this person and it was just serendipitous because it just so happened that he had exactly what he had been needing and looking for and they just crossed path imagine that just kind of accidentally fell out of the tree and uh and and ran off and did something together but we realized that brother branham showed us there are no accidents there as brother lee on my bible study i love how he says that there are no accidents there's only god there's only god sedence so there's god sides say did you become a believer by accident no it was a god sedan hallelujah why are you here tonight because you accidentally came to church no it was a god sentence why can't you run away why can't you go in the world it's a god sedence friend god is controlling and there are no accidents people it's interesting because people how do i say this people don't people don't recognize brother eugene was teaching this on the on the air the other day how that how that it moved me i came in behind him and made quite a bit of commentary on it people don't recognize modern events made clear in prophecy amen amen they're happening like popcorn all around us everything you see in the political world right now is being controlled because either the prophecy under the seals to the gentiles or more probably more likely the trumpets to the jews because god is going back to get israel and he can't get them until we're gone and that's why i showed you as a hero a couple weeks ago in the scriptures that you're living at a time where this triple triple convergence where the the reapers of the last revival this message the gentiles are still here in the field the field is the world jesus said they're still in the field trying to gather the last the last remains and you've already got the the sowers for the next event which is moses and elijah and above all of that you've got the treader of grapes which is the tribulation and you're living in a triple convergence of all of that no wonder we see things that look like pre-tribulation judgments and yet we say wait a minute we're not supposed to be in the tribulation that's correct but what's happening is you've got reapers and you've got sowers and you've got a treader of grapes i'm here to tell you you're in an amazing hour friends this is a time like it's never been before and people don't recognize modern events that are made clear in prophecy what's sad is sometimes even people sitting in message churches don't recognize it that's actually a worse problem see say brother jason it's a pretty bold statement well i i you know i'm just i'm just calling the pyramid like i see it amen i'm looking at the pyramid and it's it's it's missing its turns and cuts it's not really rising up off the earth floor it's not really pointing to him too very much see the obvious lack of deep spirituality reveals itself by the lifestyle choices they make i'm not saying that to hurt people's feelings that's just the truth judgment begins at the house of god that's what this is this isn't a feel-good place this is a judgment place this is where you come here and i i can i can tell you you know i can tell you the things you need to fix as the lord said to me say oh i want you to tell me something encouraging i am i'm telling you how to get fixed i'm telling you how to get rid of your sin i'm telling you all to be ashamed of yourself and give your heart more to god and more sincerity that's that's encouragement amen see so so we find that that a lot of times i'm looking at too many pyramids and i can see the lack of a deep spirituality and it reveals itself you know in the choices that people make the way they just the way they prioritize their spiritual needs versus their natural needs and wants i mean just that one right there i didn't got to go to another one just the way people prioritize yes amen let's just forget about places they go and ways they dress and things they do that are shameful for a christian to be doing going dressing saying but just the way that sometimes people who sit in message churches claim to be believers prioritize their natural needs and wants over their spiritual needs and that is perfectly upside down no wonder you don't have the peace of god that passes understanding no wonder you feel like a neurotic no wonder you don't have faith no wonder you're always in trouble amen see because you know why because god loves you and he won't let you get by with that he will bring you because he loves you see brother branham said how and i i don't remember if i showed you this last time uh the sunday prior but i i i mentioned it to you i just didn't i didn't read it to you from the masterpiece you remember those those two or three little girls at the back of the line who got out of step and remember that's that's that's they were at the back of the back age at the back of the line they were the last one that's that's you and me that's you and me and brother branham says he says they were getting back i'm thankful he said when he came out of the vision they were hurrying trying to get back in step but he said they were trying their best so i i want to say to you today are you trying your best you might be out of step but try your best see and so he says they were getting back just get in line cause here's what happened here's what did it because they was looking out somewhere else watching about that church that just went out into chaos see so it distracted them and they lost their cadence they lost their rhythm they lost their march they were still a believer they were still the little bride they were still the sainted bunch of little girls they were still in an order of ascending they were still going up but they were out of step i'm not here i'm not here today saying are you a bunch of unbelievers i'm saying too many times i have found myself come on we're all in this thing together you haven't heard me say that in a while maybe i need to say it more often we're all in this thing together i found myself yeah i'm still a believer i'm still ascending i still love the lord my faith is still perfect but sometimes i've got a little distracted by the madness of the world and the politics and the churches and the social uh fabric and say it is distracting amen and they got out of steps see so i find as ministry i thought about this as ministry i thought about to myself and my fellow ministers here and ministers around the world who may hear this we must as leaders because the distractions are so rampant and they cause god's true family to get out of step then i say we must raise the ensign brothers higher and higher still to to do what to counter the descending of the age that's going off the cliff we must blow the trumpet louder and blow it louder and louder and how do you say how do we do that brothers by taking ourselves deeper and deeper into our experience of the holy ghost so that god can create an attraction on the mountain in our lives how many want that see now that's not just pulpit ministers can i say that that's not just pulpit ministers we're all ministers we all have loved ones we want to see make it so we need to have something that will catch the hearts and minds of those under our care see and so those who are being distracted by the world and the false church plunging into chaos i want you to know something tonight friends and i want to reiterate it from the beginning there is a main current that god has there is a main current that god has and and and it and it flows just like the just like the sea of life has a current just like the heavens and the atmospheres have a current i i was praying as i was studying this and sitting in my dark quiet time early in the morning one of my favorite times of the day when everything is still and it's just me and talking to the lord and i was thinking and pondering this thought and i just said lord help me reach the main current lord help me lift up higher let me get up there in those atmospheres where the current is blowing toward calvary let me get up there where it's blowing towards zion let me get up there lord god how many have that desire tonight say lord let me find your main current for my life find the plan of god because you know when you get in that current then it'll it'll just carry you i mean when you get in god's main current nature will take its take its course and you'll find yourself following god's word i got a little bit more time i'm going to use it so just sit still you know i read an article a young lady wrote very fine seemingly young lady wrote a very nice article about decisions and making decisions and she titled it swimming against the current and she talks about how that that she was grateful to her parents because when she was being raised that you know she was she was just you know praising her parents and and the first thing that raised my eyebrow the first time is she said you know from a very early age they they basically not basically they did give me freedom to just do whatever i wanted to do and i went oh boy i wonder how that's going to turn out and i'm just reading and she said that she went on and she actually began to make some good points and i thought you know that even even that's that's good psychology i mean that's that's helpful if if taken in the right way and she thought about she said one of the things that whenever she said whenever the only requirement we had was we had to agree to sit down with our parents and tell them the decisions we were about to make and and at least let them hear it and and advise us and so she said me and my siblings we made that deal and so she said they had a list of questions and they were always the same and they're very fine questions they're very good questions as parents you're going to see that's a pretty good question and here here was her ques the questions questions to ask regarding decisions number one how do you think your decision will impact you and those involved decent question you agree number two do you think this is the best choice you can make and number three is that what you really want and it was these three questions and there was a fourth one i'll get to shortly if i don't run out of time but these were and she said that they had to the deal was we had to listen to these questions and we had to honestly answer them and we had to deliberate and sometimes we had to deliberate a couple of days until we could come back to them and say i have thought about the impact that the decision i'm about to make i have thought through the impact that it will have on me and anyone else involved see because i used to tell i just tell my children growing up listen boys this is bigger than you you're making decisions that affect me and mom you're making decisions that affect our name so you know don't be selfish because this life is bigger than you life ain't here to suit all your needs see i mean all your wants and so do you think this is the best choice you can make and is that think think hard now is that what you really want and she went on to preach a gospel of swimming against the current in fact as these were her main points swimming against the current not caring about what people will say following your dreams now listen friends i want to say something that watch now let me let me go on now i want to there's results to this this was part of her article that if you if you think these things through and you swim again you're willing to swim against the current and you're willing to not care what people say as long as you're following your dreams you know some of the advantages of that can be it gives you the power to say no when required it teaches you to follow your hunch it gives you the power to create your own destiny it gives you the courage to take your imagination to the next level it reveals the hidden talents and qualities within you all sounds really good all of that psychology psychologically that sounds really good and i wouldn't doubt that in a from a humanistic point of view you might reap some or all of these advantages but what i went through the article with a fine-tooth comb and i went through it because i was looking i thought surely surely somewhere surely somewhere this young woman is going to at least in a cursory way mention she's at least surely going to mention thank god or i was very blessed you know the modern language they used today i was i was so blessed you know and and and i read through it i didn't find it and i thought i got to read it again and i read through it again and i was looking carefully and slowly to see if she made even a single reference say well brother jason why does if this is good psychologically then why does she got to worry about god well i mean that's just like communism communism actually is a bible doctrine sure in the book of acts they had all things in common ananias and sapphira died because they weren't good communists see and so so they had all things in common and and that that's that and that's what marxism brother branham talks about the tenets of marxism if you go and read it about equality of everybody and everybody have all things in common and let's let's all be all it's kind of like all for one and one for all it's kind of like the millennium will be set up see but the problem with that that that they did was they got a hold of a bible concept of communal living and they erased god out of it and that's why brother branham said communism was wrong modern-day political communism is of the devil and it's a tool in the hands of god to destroy catholicism which is worse catholicism is worse than communism and communism will destroy it so so it's it's it doesn't it it might be a good principle it might have all of these good advantages but where's god in it see how how are you going to how you're going to hope that this is going to turn out what they're trying to say well you know did she have a good career yet she'd make a lot of money sure was she seemingly happy yes and she had her career and i'm sure listen let me tell you something unless she ever finds god in her life and maybe she does i don't know but i'm just using it as an example hypothetically speaking unless unless this woman if this woman is without god in her life you know what'll be her outcome she'll stay rich and successful and alive and healthy and happy until she's not amen until she's not she'll stay ahead of it and big bank accounts and big happiness and big social circles and alive and healthy and happy until she's not because all of it comes to a serendipitous end no it's not serendipitous it's not accidental it's not accidental people don't actually accidentally end up in hell because god christ died for their sins to keep them from going there and if they go there they didn't get there by accident they got there because of determination they persevered to go to hell you see and so so you find then that you know that that they're good questions and they seem to have good advantages they seem to have good outcomes let me hold it right there they seem to have good outcomes you know on the surface you still with me i know it's wednesday but hang on swimming against the current not caring about what people will say now listen to me young people because i'm really going to help you here following your dreams all sounds good right yeah but let me tell you what a man almost 60 here can tell you about that how many famous people this morning as you lifted your eyes from sleep they lifted their eyes in hell amen today this morning and they've been there now nigh on to 14 hours when i woke up at 6 00 a.m you know where i woke up in the same place i went to sleep there was a lot of other famous people and not so famous people in the world who also woke up but not where they went to sleep that is a fact that's not a story or disney or a movie or a game that's for real and you don't get a respawn you don't get to reset that's for real swim against the current follow your dreams how many hollywood stars have i heard say that in my life oh i just how did you get so successful oh i just followed my dream i just wouldn't let anybody stop me i just i just i just ignored all the naysayers and now here they are rich and famous and if they died in that condition they're going to lift their head up in hell [Music] because they know nothing of god at all see how many i'm telling you real stories friends how many music industry stars have i heard in my lifetime make those kinds of statements absolutely how many sports icons have i heard say that how many of them to this day here we are what is today the 22nd and we go back i can just go back 10 years and just put a bullet list up here of famous movie stars and famous sports stars and famous music industry stars who have been lifting who followed their dreams and chased it and made these kind of decisions and ignored god in their life and have been lifting their eyes in hell for the last decade amen and when they had their big party saying oh he's looking down oh she's looking down they weren't they were looking up screaming they weren't looking down smiling they were looking up screaming because they weren't up there they were down there that's a bible fact and you need to come sometimes to the house of god the house of judgment and hear that fact amen see amen yet it's the battle cry of people it's incredible how many people you know in this day and hour that we live in that's almost like the the thing that everybody lives by they're people who who believe who believe this way are literally celebrated for it you know where i want to ask the question where is god's word as guides in their life people people sit in churches and hear the word of god preached multiple times a week even in message churches and hear the gospel preached multiple times a week and yet they live every day with carnal edges on their testimony they make choices in their lives it's very obvious that the lord was not consulted or either his answer wasn't followed amen and i'm here to tell you something friends as long as i'm your shepherd i will not shy away from that amen i i want you there too bad to shy away from it i was stunned with an article the other day i saw in the news one of the leading elite missed somebody i don't know who she was and she was she had a she had she was making headlines and everybody's applauding her because she made this statement she she showed up at some big event and i have no idea what it was i certainly didn't look at it but i was just reading the headline and she shows up at some big hollywood gala and she's got on even what even what even what common people thought was that's pretty indecent you know what she said to them and they wrote it in headlines and are applauding her for it said people who think that are brainwashed i just say you're right you are right i've been my mind has been washed clean by the washing of the water of the word hallelujah go ahead and laugh at it go ahead and make fun go ahead and go ahead and keep god out of your decisions not me go ahead sit in churches sit in message churches sit in this message church and hear it week after week after week and stay edgy and stay carnal and keep victory out of your home and see you'll see what see how that turns out for you see what happens to your children i'm here to tell you not in my house not under my watch i'm here to preach the gospel i'm here to tell you there's a way that's right and there's a way that's wrong see people make so many decisions overwhelmingly with little to no regard for what a prophet taught i mean you go you stare at the divorce rates just in this nation alone and you can see right away that nobody has regard for a prophet saying you should wait and pray and get a word from the lord and wait until see they the divorce got so bad they finally just started living in sin together don't even get married at all it's obvious america hasn't taken the warning of elijah who told them that god's vindicated prophet warned against god's vindicated prophet warned against chasing after science and education he warned us against that he warned us against brother branham called civilization over the devil amen and and proved that he proved to even the common man that the the more knowledge they get the more death is associated with it and that's incontrovertible you can't even deny that look on the streets friends look on the streets of just this small city and tell me you know if if if this teaching the real bible the real word is even regarded hardly at all amen just in this little fair city just in our little seaside town you'll see right away that a prophet's message is almost not regarded at all except by the believers brother branham listen listen friends listen brother branham wasn't really so much hard on sinners of his day he actually he would even say things like you know don't take away their pleasures it's the only thing they have that was his attitude towards sinners he loved them you know but brother branham said what you do is you try to show something you try to show them something of greater value you try to show them a higher life see and so you know he didn't name his arrows at famous sinners of his days brother branham didn't it we what brother branham shot his arrows at was the impersonation of christianity that's what he was against he wasn't against the sinner he was against thee and now he would talk about ernie ford and and all those get on there and said in the honky tonk on friday and in the church choir on sunday amen see and pat boone and elvis presley and all of them sold their birthright for a fleet of cadillacs you know it it it was the impersonation he he was he was never that troubled you know about the famous people of his day two of the most famous women of brother branham's day was jackie kennedy and marilyn monroe and brother branham spoke compassionately about them he said you know he said mrs kennedy shouldn't do the things she does he said but maybe if she ever heard one of these messages of mine she might straighten up maybe she's never heard one of my messages see and he talked about marilyn monroe very efficiently said i wish i could have got to or said the child had a heart attack trying to reach for the phone and he said i wish i could have got to her he said i think i could have showed her something that that might have attracted her you know it so it wasn't it wasn't jackie kennedy that troubled brother branham it wasn't marilyn monroe that troubled him what troubled him and made him lash out was people of god who were supposed to be christians admiring them and copying their lifestyle in the churches and calling themselves believers you know it becomes rather obvious that a consciousness that this is just a temporary training gown training ground is absent from their minds it's missing because people even though a prophet proved that civilization is of the devil and he proved there's more death everybody's still chasing it it goes to show you that man's mind is not aware this is just a temporary stopover this life isn't even about this one it's just a proving field a training field a proving ground the life coming that's the life to live for friends i'm gonna point out some good truths and then i'm to ask you a question so be ready to consider something here's the first fact i want to give you there is a real god who is explaining more than that i don't need to he is there is a real god who is who is what preacher who is what who is holy there is a real god who is righteous there is a real god who cares about you there is a real god who is interested in you a god who will save you from the judgments that are rushing to meet us this is a god listen friends listen to this this is a god who can actually put you on a path if you can find your way to god's main current amen that current can put you on a path that the results of your decision can be fully known in advance [Music] fully known in advance whether it will have a good ending or a bad ending fully known in advance what it will produce and can tell you now you ready i told you to ask you a question who wants that who wants that i'm talking about a main current of god that if you slip and manage to get into that slipstream that main current of god that's headed for zion i'm here to tell you it'll carry you all the way and it'll take you in this life and it'll give you the it'll look at the decisions you're going to make today and it'll tell you the outcome you're going to have tomorrow with pinpoint accuracy just as accurate as enoch's pyramid see i'm i'm i'm done i'm going to close right now sometimes people find themselves in one of these situations i have work and school and hobbies and my social friendships and i'll come to church when i can how do you think your decision will impact you and those involved if you think like that amen i'll repeat it again i have work i have school i have hobbies i have social friendships i'll come to church when i can or it might sound like this i'm an adult with my own family and i don't need ministers bawling me out and telling me what to do amen do you think that's the best choice you can make be honest my sermon's over this is it these are my last slides i'm an adult with my own family i don't need ministers bawling me out and telling me what to do in love because i love you and look you right in the eye and i rarely do that do you think this is the best choice you could make pastor i don't need to be more spiritual i can be a christian and still dress like fake christians is that what you really want i just want to be free to live in sin is that what you really want are you sure are you sure that you want to let work and school and hobbies and social events come and and make your church schedule a fit in thing are you sure you want that you want uh that you don't want me are you sure you don't want me bawling you out when i see carnal things are you sure you sure you want a pastor who never does that you think you don't need to be spiritual

to live in sin i'm asking you in love is that what you really want brother branham made this statement he said now no chastening for the presence seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless he's quoting the scripture nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby some may not have an interest in this peaceable fruit of

there's not one of these requests that we've made and there's no hands lord that is asking for anything outside of your word and fact is it's everything according to your word and we're taught to ask ask abundantly that your joy may be full lord i want to see us our our joy be filled up tonight that every one of these needs father would be met that you that we would get a a resounding uh successful testimony from sister chastity from sister kathy from sister brenda from brother rodney lord from sister lisa from anna and brother aaron lord in the name of jesus may you move on the scene for them tonight be merciful lord you told us that we should be kindly affection one to another so lord you could hardly ask us to do that if you weren't like that so father may you look upon these
