TRANSCRIPT
========================================
instead of giving you time to linger that atmosphere but that atmosphere should be in our lives all the time anyway amen and we uh we have some ideas and plans that we want to put to you and um it's preliminary and then brother matt's going to kind of give you where we where our thinking is there is still i want to say this so you don't run ahead with worry there is a ton of due diligence we still have to do to see if everything we want to do is even possible to see if the cost can be manageable but your trustees who you've entrusted to watch after the church in financial matters they are in unison today they took a vote among themselves they were 100 behind this plan brother mark will express that when he comes up but uh we're going to need your prayers we're going to need your support amen because it's quite ambitious and i i i have become persuaded in my in in my way and uh kind of just i don't want to say it any more than that just in my way i kind of was to say well let's just do some cosmetic things but if you know i be i've become persuaded brother jason has become persuaded by all the team of brothers to say listen if we do that and we make it pretty it really doesn't still meet our needs not even now to say nothing of long term so we're now looking forward to something a little more aggressive brother matt i'll turn it over to you god bless you bless you i'm getting if you want to go to pull that up we had a um and not that one not that one nope the first one i showed you actually just stand by we're going to show those in order so we had a business meeting i know that you um sisters probably uh inquired from your husbands what that was about and i'm sure most of you have been made aware that we've uh we're going to move into the second phase of renovations for the property we started with the outside and uh i personally think the outside is beautiful and we have a just a quite a bit of a difference the night and day at the end of all the project we'll show you some of the before and after pictures that we have but it's quite an improvement to what we've what we had prior with just the block um now we have the beautiful outside and the new landscaping and some other renovations we did even to the fellowship hall some of that there's still as you can tell there's effects from that that are temporary such as the trim around these windows just waiting also the lighting we put in new lighting didn't fix the ceilings because we knew uh we were going to be going to the second phase which would be the interior renovation and so just to sort of show you how that has evolved we had a meeting and that meeting was just to talk about some improvements that we want to do to the interior that would help the interior match the exterior and the look that we're going for and so that meeting was largely covering the removal of this ceiling that you have above you above these beams and i'm a lot of this is repetitive all of it's repetitive for the brothers who are here um but above you is uh beautiful just raw milled wood and trusses that that hold the roof and the walls together and so we it's we wanted our idea was to open this up to vault the ceiling it's already voted but to remove this and you would see the vaulted ceiling and the expose the beautiful uh wood that they that they used when they built this church 1950s i think if that 55 somewhere in there so when they built this property they uh they did a good job at just some of the the way that they they uh put up the trusses and the the the materials that they use are beautiful so we want to we also have had a need for a while with air conditioning when it gets uh hot this ac system is undersized and doesn't keep up with the the need that we have especially during the hottest months and so the idea was also to change that completely entirely since we would be vaulting the ceiling you would no longer have the space for you could run duck a ductile system but the plan was was is to use um large commercial mini splits that would cool and heat the entire building um and so most of the business meeting was about the cosmetic things that we could do plus the air conditioning spray foaming the um the uh the the roof so that we could have you know proper adequate um uh efficiency for our heating and cooling and so we we sort of started with that and when we talked amongst brothers uh we were ball parking just a general ballpark um the demolition of that new carpet also this carpet has seen better days uh it's done really well to hold up they carpet on the stage and the carpet that's in the on the main floor seating has done well to to hold up but we want to change some of the colors a lot of the woodwork that you see uh maybe uh we we would consider it dated and so we want to update some of that the paneling that's on the wall to take that out and drywall change the color so a lot of cosmetic changes we were ball parking that in the range of about 50 000 somewhere in there of which we are going to do a building fund and fund the church funded the outside and so we're going to do a building fund to fund all of the the uh future renovations we were looking at after phase two which would be the interior renault to be phase three which would be the fellowship poll and obviously if you've been in the fellowship hall lately it's packed even with just a third or two-thirds of the church there there's not much there's not much elbow room and so we've had a great need there and so the idea was to maybe expand that maybe to cover in the pavilion and to stick frame that and to actually extend the fellowship paul move the kitchen there was a lot of ideas but obviously we were just focused on phase two after some conversation uh with brothers and and actually a lot of this is things that even brother mark carter and other brothers but the mark actually drew up some things and did some for the trustees and did some uh 3d imaging of that what it would look like with just toying with different ideas of adding the vestibule we need bathrooms in the front you know changing the fellowship hall maybe adding the building so there was all kinds of ideas but what we've honed down on is what we're going to do i'm going to show you in this floor plan is to rather than just go for a small cosmetic facelift you could call it that why don't we solve problems because we have some issues that we've had here for a long time on this property such as bathrooms out here no bathrooms at the front you have to walk especially if it's raining it's real inconvenient sunday school rooms bathrooms the heating and cooling problem that we've had the stage is too small these guys are cramped uh up here stage is too small and even seating when we're when we have our entire church and we're packed in it's packed in nice and tight but we we look to grow and the lord's there's families the church is going to be growing here over the next couple months with families moving in so how do we how do we accommodate everything solve some problems with our fellowship hall solve problems with office space and how the space is laid out currently right now and so um god sends the right people at the right time exactly the right time god sent brother steve and sister emily curtis our way and brother steve has a profession in design designs houses and so uh he was gracious enough to give us some beautiful renders and concepts actual life-like life-size so true to what it would look like because the program that he used he used his lidar on his phone to get an exact image and he took measurements of what the building space is square footage and then he put that in concept so the conceptualizing thing that you're looking at what you're about to see uh is the design the colors the carpet even down to the chairs everything is is life-like what it will look like um when we're when we're done i want to just say also that this is a preliminary i'm i we just wanted to bring the church up to speed because there was a lot of chatter after the meeting what's happening so today is not the full presentation we don't have all the answers um we we have a lot of logistics to work out that we'll be doing we do however have a team of team leads brothers who have agreed to lead up the effort um we have different brothers and those brothers are here most of them are here today some are traveling out of town um and then brother steve also has worked up these images uh and also on top of that he's worked up the initial preliminary floor plan there are some things that can change and things that i'm sure will change you're going to notice that the fellowship paul want to show it to you doesn't have a kitchen and it doesn't have sunday school rooms so don't bombard the trustees or brother steve especially leave brother steve alone um tom bob if you want to come to brother stephen ask question come to me to save him from getting bombarded because he's come to me yeah come to the pastor he's simply drawn what we've proposed to him uh and designed what we've designed and so there's going to be a lot of questions and what if we did this what about this we're thinking about all of that and there's uh you know there's a lot of consensus based things i'm going to show you uh two different roof plans one is with exposed trusses one is with a um what would you call the second i'd say like a coffered ceiling yeah like faux beams coffered ceiling all white um so there's there's two different styles i'm gonna show you here and then a really neat video brother steve put together um and so just going to show that at the very end i want to just say again this is preliminary it is the direction that we've chosen to go we're going to be doing a building fund um for that there will be a lot of fundraising for that brother ken boos is going to be leading that effort and he's going to be up here before you on his own discretion maybe weekly or every week basis just doing giving you an update on where we are with the fund um he's put together a document with a lot of good even scriptures i wish i would have read this morning didn't didn't pull them up i was going to pull them up just things that the bible talks about in nehemiah when they put their hand when everyone joined in unison and put their hand and had the spirit of help and of labor and of work so we need your prayers we're going to need your financial support to do it um it's very beautiful i'm going to start with the dry part of this which is the floor plan um just to show you an overview so you know what you're looking at when you see the render so pull up the floor plan gideon um there you go and make that big and i don't have a way to control it just make it full screen make it full screen the green yep uh and then command plus we'll zoom it in if you could do that zoom in again again can we turn these lights out and of course all of them every single one of them stage lights and everything and then if you can use the up down left and right arrow keys getting you can go up go down down there now up one stop perfect what you're seeing is um zoom out one time actually getting i want to see all the outside walls here and we can send this uh so that you can have and look it up close um man i wish i had a way to control this i don't know i can't use a laser pointer so maybe on a step you have the wireless mic brother just an explanation here the outside walls that you see here this entire square just the rectangle square if you could yeah use the mouse and show just the square here going around that is the existing sanctuary that includes from that wall back wall all the way to the back wall beyond the stage to the offices that's the existing building we're not expanding that we're keeping the same outside walls that we have here that's not getting expanded what we are doing in and and if you just uh let me explain it this way and you understand the prints better this stage the stage wall is is gone so everything goes back all the offices in the back the pastor's study the bathrooms that we have back here everything is gone everything shifts this way which will allow room um to to put what you see here and zoom in here gideon on this uh this front area here just zoom in right right here um and go over go over this way go over this way zoom in again here zoom in again okay so what you're seeing here is the vestibule area come down this way nursery women's restrooms an area just a little a wall leading into that men's restrooms above you could zoom back out and so vestibule bathroom sound room cry room all up front and then the stage all the way to the back now you say what happens to the offices and you know and all of that well behind that is the um addition if you go that way gideon that way yep and zoom in on that some if you could you see that there's an addition um on the back in between the fellowship hall and the church now will be filled with a new addition plus an addition to the side that is down here come down this way so down here this is a new addition to would be over here for the pastor's study go this way towards the fellowship hall and then zoom out zoom out now the current fellowship poll stops about right here stops about right there and so if you imagine a line going over that's our current size you can see we're removing the roof structure that we have back here and we're framing that all in and expanding extending the fellowship hall and even past that put in another awning almost like the roof structure but an awning that would go out uh beyond that and then there's restrooms also if you zoom in if you come up here to the fellowship hall area up here getting the very top of your screen and zoom in right here zoom in on this go over go over zoom in again so the entrance to the fellowship hall is here with restrooms we still got to lay out bathrooms etc um you're not going to see this in the con conceptualizing images you're just going to see the sanctuary that's what the con concept images are of but the floor plan shows that in in gist if i could just keep it simple the sanctuary we're not adding to the front some people ask that's going to stay what we're going to do is add a we're going to redo how we have the layout back there with the booth we're going to add men's and women's restrooms we're going to add a nice vestibule area obviously still have a nursery and a sound booth there and then by doing this setup of this new sanctuary we add between 70 and 80 seats to this sanctuary so we're able to stay on this property longer so really the improvements that we're doing is maximizing the potential of this property without going overboard and over building it so if we were to grow to a 300 the seating will seat 192 is what the new sanctuary will seat if we go beyond that and we're in the 300 range the lord tarries and adds to the church well then we would the trustees and the church would just have to decide to sell the property buy something else but this is maximizing it to its fullest potential so you would have this stage all the way back we would the stage would increase in size obviously not in width but in depth would increase in size you would have doors that come you could imagine doors even though stage is going to be rearranged that would lead to the new addition the back offices which is this area right here go over getting in this way uh that is this area here with a new music room pastor study av room some bathrooms back there a hallway a way to get from the fellowship hall into here and then back and forth um and so uh that that is the general floor plan uh ideas with the additions that we're proposing now i want you to go to the second uh make sure i want to make sure i get the right one not the one with the white ceilings gideon you should have another document no no close that document entirely go to finder and then open up the second the next document um give him just a moment to do that and then bring that up and slide it over um uh yeah that's it yep yep yep yep i think so keep going keep going over um okay make that full screen so this is just some images of the overhead view if i was back there i could zoom in and show this but i'm not going to try to do that now if you just go through some of the pictures go to the next one this is just a sky view um the next one there that's looking from just a different angle and now this is the elevations this roof here that's coming on the sidewalk and to the front is optional this is just a concept like i said this is looking from if you're approaching from battery creek road going down mossy oaks road next next image that's the front of the church next image stop stop there that would be from if you're coming from reebok as you pull up next image this is um there you go from the school as you approach if you were to park over here this is the side you see the new edition for the pastor's study uh coming over and tied into the existing fellowship hall next next next you can see that there's a new awning from out from the fellowship hall it's not the existing one that's a new edition keep going there stop there now this is the image of the new sanctuary all the way down from the colors to the design this is the exposed trusses that we talked about um and so the what you see tying them in is cabling and hardware black hardware next image the view from over here go through it next and this is from wait maybe where brother steve is sitting now brother aaron uh next keep going stop there back there just want to give everybody a minute just to take in the beauty next image next and that's looking from the sound booth you can see the added seating it's beautiful beautiful next image there that's looking from uh right in this area looking up you can see the new brick wall the entire new stage setup and layout will be different little different than it is now uh next if i'm missing anything brothers feel free to just to stop me if i'm missing any details you the church should know um next this is as if the lights you can see the cross that we have there's going to be lit it's going to be a lighted cross and this is this as if the sun had went down you're looking from the vestibule area to the left would be women's restroom and nursery to the right would be the men's restroom okay you can close that one there is there is also another one getting very much like that uh should be in there another document you could open just another pdf this shows the different ceiling uh we want to show that this is a different style make that large and you can just go through those pictures showing that coffer type still sealing look a little bit slightly different and then glass i like that a lot better glass doors for the vestibule doors leading in and that's it correct now i just want to tell you the last thing is just a video make sure the computer is on muted jackson if you could and has a little bit of volume because it has some beautiful beautiful singing to it sort of gives you an idea of what it would feel like inside of it i like how brother steve made this this is a video showing it's going to switch back and forth between the two ceilings options the exposed truss and then the coffer go ahead and play that [Music] move the mouse your presence is my favorite gift [Music] your presence is i think brother steve hey man steve did such a wonderful job amen on those i i told him i said the emoticon that has the the head that's exploding would be the perfect perfect one to use for that so i did a wonderful job on that so that's the update we can give you um as i said there's going to be more information more details to come that'll follow this we're going to be getting pricing that's just the floor plan preliminary plans we're going to need to mep the mechanical electrical plumbing plan we're going to need the demo plan we're going to need the foundation plan so there's a lot to get i've got to go to the city talk to them about what we're doing what we want to do um we don't know somewhere you know i would i would throw out a rough number of if the 50 000 was the facelift this is probably closer to 150. we won't know that number so don't don't ask us we won't know that number till we actually get hard numbers and pricing on everything and then when we have that brother ken will be doing a presentation on the fundraising and how to how to fund this so why don't you give the lord just another hand clap amen amen i got brother mark carter's gonna come and just say a few words from the board of trustees i just wanted to just reiterate what brother jason said what our role as trustees is and and maybe tell you how we actually think about it when we're doing that you know our job is to represent you all and things physical material with the church the property keeping the upkeep and also any indebtedness keeping the church from many what we feel would be unnecessary indebtedness um of course ours is just four votes brother george brother charles brother john and myself we're just four boats just like you but we represent you like when we go to these meetings and um my mindset and i know the other brothers feel the same way we've discussed it when i go there there's people with a big overarching vision like brother matt he sees the big picture what we can do um there's people that are very technical you know you could you can't do that because this won't work but i go there with the perspective of how it affects you how you would think about it even though i think of those things too you know it's um i try to put myself what the questions people will have so we are we do take that very seriously and when we go to one of the meetings we're thinking like you would think and i've had people come to me and say things like well it's you know what we got now works i mean it's all cosmetic what we're talking about doing do we really need it and um the way we're thinking about it um i think we took a poll here everybody would say that there's three things that we need i think it would be 100 all the bathrooms everybody would say we need new bathrooms um as far as room in here i mean on sundays it gets crowded there's even families i see them they can't sit together they've got to sit in separate parts of the church and then the fellowship hall this is the things we thought about the fellowship hall when everybody stays you can't even turn around in there every sunday it's a race between the ladies and the brothers to see who gets that good spot and we usually win because we eat faster so but yeah we considered all of that and um so we're in unison the trustee board representing you that this is a necessary thing we think that it's a good thing to do we looked at all the other avenues buying another place building from scratch and this is by far the most affordable and efficient way to do it and as far as like the cosmetic things um yeah just doing them from scratch it's expensive but in the whole big project of doing those other things doing those things then it's a bargain you can usually do that for about a third of what it would cost if we just went in to try to do that so even though they are just for looks that's important and it would be very very affordable in the course of this whole big project to go ahead and do those things so i just wanted to give you our perspective on it and reassure you that we take it very seriously not wonderful amen so we you kind of have our ideas of where we're going to go forward and i just want to uh just to say you know and i made this um statement to the trustees this morning and to all of the brothers uh who brother matt has placed into team lead positions that i cannot as the pastor here i cannot become entrenched in a construction program i hope you'll understand that you don't need me to anyway we have very qualified men you know i i have a duty to give myself to prayer and the study of god's word continually for your needs spiritually along with the ministry team that god uh helps me with and a lot of them are going to be working brother matt uh will be taking the lead as he did on the outside uh i there's so many people that have helped on every aspect of it uh one second deb one second says uh and um it's really been a great group effort but i think that we owe an extra measure of gratitude to brother matt and sister rachel who really uh rachel was really my right-hand man if i can call a woman that on design and and she's got a tremendous amount of leadership and influence on the inside of you saw many of our ideas we're still going back and forth on a few ideas but i just appreciate brother matt and sister rachel tremendously amen and so you know uh i'm sure it's no secret to you brother matt has served as my right-hand man to be my direct assistance to help pastor this church he actually pastored tucson tabernacle for a year so he has plenty of ample experience in it and we'll be i'll be looking to him to really take the reins of this so if you have any questions don't call me amen bother call him amen and uh and then if he if you if he don't have an answer i promise you he'll have a trustee or a team leader who will have an answer and so it's going to be a tremendous group effort the only thing that we we know for sure at this point is we want to do it now how we're going to do it and how it's all going to stack out and what it's all going to look like that's going to go forward and we're going to keep you in the loop of it i promise you we'll keep you in the loop of it and so don't don't think sisters that it's just a bunch of men going to design the looks we're actually not we're building the superstructure and we're gonna let um sister rachel take the lead and she's got some ladies that have been helping her as well uh look and and don't bomb sister debbie amen so but there there are plenty of people who will be looking at this and sisters with multiple talents to help uh put all this together now as if all of that isn't enough i need everybody to go outside and be ready for a picture amen so we're going to dismiss sister emily and let her go out there so when you go out there you'll be confronted and i'm just kidding yeah she'll get it over the fast she's a she's a professional photographer and so she will get it over fast and then she'll be able to get that raw data to sister wanda and i had personally just wanted to keep the um the directory uh digital i'm all about saving the tree i'm not a liberal but just about saving the trees and and let's just make it digital but people had concerns with having their digital information on our website so we're going to go back to paper i'm going to acquiesce in that but remember to acquiesce means to agree to reluctantly so i'm going to uh give the go-ahead for a new paper um directory sister wand has done that for years so we appreciate that let's stand to our feet and and uh we're going to be dismissed amen let's bow our heads father we thank you for this wonderful day that we've had and that we're having lord we just love you we love being part of your family we love being family to each other lord that is the over arcing feeling that we have here at this church that we are all just one big family we that's that's intentional lord that's on purpose we strive to make it that way lord we think of ideas to foster that so my father i pray that you will guide us be our guide lord i pray that you will guide brother matt as he oversees such a program as this guide the trustees lord all the team lead positions lord we are looking to these brothers to provide for us lord a comfortable and adequate facilities that we might gather families and have the have the fellowship of the saints the delivery of the word the receiving of the word and the in the atmospheres of christ we commit it to you now in jesus christ's name amen god bless you friends you
