[0:21] I pledge
[0:23] alance
[0:26] to
[0:28] the lamb. am with all my strength.
[0:34] With all I am, I will seek
[0:40] to honor
[0:43] his
[0:45] commands.
[0:47] I pledge
[0:49] alance
[0:51] to
[0:55] the lamb.
[0:59] I have heard
[1:01] how Christians
[1:04] long
[1:06] ago
[1:08] were brought
[1:10] before
[1:12] a ty throne.
[1:15] They were told
[1:18] that he would spare
[1:22] their lives.
[1:24] If they would
[1:26] reounce
[1:28] that name
[1:30] of Christ.
[1:32] But one by one
[1:36] they chose to die.
[1:40] The son of God.
[1:44] They would not deny
[1:48] like a great
[1:50] angelic
[1:52] fire.
[1:54] [Music]
[1:56] I can almost
[1:58] hear those voicees
[2:02] ring. I pledge
[2:06] alance
[2:08] to
[2:10] the lamb.
[2:12] With all my strength,
[2:16] with all I am, I will seek
[2:22] to honor
[2:24] his
[2:26] commitment.
[2:28] I pledge
[2:30] to lead
[2:32] [Music]
[2:36] the land.
[2:40] Now the years
[2:42] have come
[2:44] and the years have come.
[2:48] But the cause of Jesus,
[2:52] it still goes on in our time
[2:58] has come to count the cost
[3:04] to reject this world and embrace
[3:10] the cross.
[3:12] And one by one, let us live our lives
[3:19] for the one who died
[3:23] to give us life.
[3:27] Till the trumpet sounds
[3:31] on that final day.
[3:35] Let us proudly stand
[3:39] and boldly
[3:41] say I pledge
[3:45] alance
[3:47] to the lamb.
[3:51] With all my strength,
[3:55] with all I am, I will sing
[4:01] to all
[4:03] his
[4:05] command.
[4:07] I bear
[4:09] alence
[4:11] to
[4:12] [Music]
[4:14] the lamb.
[4:16] [Music]
[4:22] To the lamb of God
[4:26] who bore my face
[4:30] who took my place
[4:34] and who wore my shame.
[4:38] I will sing
[4:40] to
[4:43] his
[4:44] commands.
[4:46] I pledge
[4:48] allegiance

[6:25] Amen. And the thirst. I want you to be
[6:27] praying. Just wanted to come up here
[6:28] before just a special uh prayer request
[6:31] here again. The need went out over the
[6:33] uh WhatsApp chat about my grandmother uh
[6:36] who went on to her reward. And it's a
[6:38] very uh tragic, sad day for the family
[6:41] and the loss uh that we feel. Yet, it's
[6:44] a very happy happy day also at the same
[6:47] time. Amen. For my grandmother
[6:49] experiencing something that we only get
[6:52] a taste of.

[7:11] grandpa all of the uh my aunts and
[7:13] uncles my mom's sisters and brothers
[7:15] also my dad there um just to be able you
[7:18] know the Lord the Bible says that God is
[7:20] the God of all comfort and so people can
[7:24] comfort you but you know God can comfort
[7:26] you in a way that's supernatural I
[7:28] believe more than just good kind words
[7:30] those are always comforting but I
[7:32] believe that the Bible says that there's
[7:34] a peace peace that can pass even our own
[7:36] understanding. Would you pray that the
[7:38] Lord envelops my family with that right
[7:41] now? Amen. Just through the night uh

[9:03] all
[9:04] [Music]
[9:08] I am. I will seek
[9:12] to honor
[9:14] his coming.
[9:18] Pledge
[9:20] alce
[9:22] to
[9:26] the lamb.
[9:29] Good evening everybody. It's good to be
[9:32] in the house of the Lord this evening.
[9:33] Um really appreciate that song. It
[9:35] really touched me. I was kind of sitting
[9:37] in the back and I heard that song being
[9:39] sang and I had to step out. I couldn't
[9:42] couldn't stand to not hear it better.
[9:45] Um,
[9:47] I guess uh it's have a little
[9:54] couple days and
[9:56] I uh it's real simple. It's not anything
[9:59] crazy. I don't claim to be any kind of a
[10:01] preacher. I do claim that the Lord is a
[10:03] preacher. Maybe if the Lord would
[10:05] preach, you might get something. If I
[10:06] preach, you'll go away disappointed. So
[10:09] maybe if the Lord would preach, maybe
[10:11] anoint this thought on my heart. um you
[10:15] might be encouraged. Uh if you could
[10:17] turn um in your Bibles, we'll we'll pull
[10:20] our text here. Um
[10:26] where was my text at?
[10:30] Uh let's um I just remembered I'm going
[10:33] to change my text up. Uh pull up uh John
[10:35] 3:16.
[10:46] Can we can all all turn here? Everyone's
[10:50] got our Bibles.
[10:55] Most of us quot it by heart. If you
[10:57] can't, well, should read your Bible
[11:00] more.
[11:02] says, "For God so loved the world that
[11:06] he gave his only begotten son that
[11:08] whosoever would believe in him would not
[11:10] perish but have everlasting life."
[11:14] We'll bow our hearts before the Lord.
[11:18] Oh great heavenly father,
[11:21] Lord, we're coming before you this
[11:22] evening with an our hearts open.
[11:25] A needy people.
[11:29] So many of us struggling. So many of us
[11:31] have needs. So many of us, all of us,
[11:34] dependent on you to make it through our
[11:35] day. Without you, we wouldn't draw the
[11:38] breath in our lungs. Without you, the we
[11:41] wouldn't have the ground that we stand
[11:43] on.
[11:44] So, Father, we're we're depending upon
[11:46] you.
[11:48] We're depending upon you for everything
[11:50] that we have, for all that is within us.
[11:53] So Lord, we're asking that you would
[11:54] come down and dwell with us this
[11:55] evening. That you would commune with us
[11:57] in the cool of the evening. That you'd
[11:59] be pleased to dwell with us. That
[12:02] anybody who would have a need, Father,
[12:03] they could they could reach out to you
[12:05] in their heart and you would come down
[12:07] and you would touch my heart. You would
[12:08] touch my lips and that I would be able
[12:10] to say something
[12:12] that I would just be an instrument and
[12:13] that I could get out of the way, Father.
[12:15] and that any anything in my flesh, any
[12:18] nervousness in my flesh would be put
[12:19] aside. That I could I could set that
[12:23] aside. That I could I could not be
[12:24] caught up in in in my thoughts, but I
[12:27] could be have my heart open to your
[12:29] thoughts and that your thoughts would
[12:31] come come down and those eternal
[12:33] thoughts that would bring the people to
[12:36] glory, Father, that the people would be
[12:38] able to have faith and would would be
[12:41] encouraged, Lord. So, we're asking the
[12:43] these things according to your word. For
[12:46] you said where two or three were
[12:47] gathered, you would be with us. And so,
[12:50] Father, we're we're asking these things
[12:53] in your holy and precious name of the
[12:55] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. You all can be
[12:59] seated.
[13:01] I'm going to
[13:04] the grace of the Lord. Hopefully I can,
[13:07] as I said, step out the way and really
[13:11] present this thought in the way that it
[13:13] came to me with the same spirit and
[13:16] passion that it came to me. It's
[13:20] it's one of the greatest challenges of a
[13:21] minister. Often times you have the Lord
[13:23] put something on your heart and then you
[13:25] know you get behind the pull pit and you
[13:26] got your your own,
[13:30] you know, things of the day, your own
[13:32] cares, your own anxieties, your own
[13:34] nervousness, your own flesh that gets in
[13:36] the way. But that's the that's the the
[13:38] the greatest uh thing that a minister
[13:40] could do is step out the way and let the
[13:41] Lord speak.
[13:44] So I want to
[13:46] I'm just going to uh read out of my
[13:48] notes here. You don't really necessarily
[13:50] have to turn
[13:51] Um,
[13:54] I'm gonna I guess that got messed up, so
[13:57] I'm going to have to turn to it in my
[13:58] Bible. Um, so I'm going to go to uh
[14:01] Revelations 17, verse one.
[14:06] Um,
[14:13] got it here.
[14:15] It says, "And there came one of the
[14:17] seven angels which had the seven vials,
[14:19] and talked with me, saying unto me, come
[14:21] hither, and I will show unto you the
[14:22] judgment of the great that siteth
[14:24] upon many waters,
[14:28] with whom the kings of the earth have
[14:30] committed fornication, and the
[14:31] inhabitants of the earth have been made
[14:33] drunk with the wine of fornication." So
[14:36] he carried me away in the spirit unto
[14:37] the wilderness. And I saw a woman sit
[14:39] upon uh a scarlet-c colored beast full
[14:42] of names of blasphemy, having seven
[14:44] heads and 10 horns.
[14:46] And the woman was arrayed in purple and
[14:48] scarlet color and decked with gold and
[14:50] precious stones and pearls, having a
[14:52] golden cup in her hand full of
[14:53] abominations and filthiness
[14:57] of her fornication.
[15:00] So, we know, you know, we're all
[15:03] pretty well verssed in the scripture. We
[15:05] know that the the prophet very clearly
[15:08] taught that this is a this is a type of,
[15:10] you know, the the the church world of of
[15:12] of the modern day that that at one time
[15:15] this is a you know, the the Lord had
[15:18] even called this this woman bride
[15:20] perhaps, but she had for she had
[15:22] committed adultery. She had taken what
[15:24] was
[15:27] a true word, a true revealed word, and
[15:29] had then exchanged that and exchanged
[15:33] the the revealed word of her day for
[15:36] some sort of man-made thing, right? That
[15:39] she had she chose to worship the works
[15:41] of her own hands
[15:43] instead of worshiping the word that God
[15:46] had given her. And so God in God's eyes
[15:50] saw that as a form of adultery, as a as
[15:53] a a fornication.
[15:56] So,
[15:58] you know, and and and so we're all
[16:00] familiar with this.
[16:02] And we might turn to uh Jeremiah chapter
[16:04] 3 6. I have it here. Says,
[16:09] "The Lord said unto me also, the Lord
[16:12] said also unto me in the days of Josiah
[16:14] the king, hast thou seen that which
[16:18] backsliding Israel has done. She has
[16:21] gone up gone up upon every high mountain
[16:25] and under every green tree, and there
[16:27] hath played the harlot."
[16:29] And I said, after she had done all these
[16:31] things, turn thou unto me. But she
[16:34] returned not, and her treacherous sister
[16:37] Judah saw it. And I saw when, for all
[16:40] the causes whereby backsliding Israel
[16:43] committed adultery, I had put her away,
[16:45] and given her a bill of divorce, yet her
[16:48] treacherous sister Judah
[16:50] feared not. But went and played the
[16:52] harlot also. And it came to pass through
[16:55] the lightness of her whoredom that she
[16:58] defiled the land and committed adultery
[17:00] with the stones and with stocks.
[17:04] And yet for all this her treacherous
[17:07] sister Judah hath not turned unto me
[17:09] with her whole heart, but faintedly
[17:12] sayeth the Lord. I want to read that
[17:15] from the NLT because I I I just like the
[17:18] way it says it. Says during the RA uh
[17:20] I'll skip down a little bit. It says um
[17:24] uh and she saw that I divorced faithless
[17:26] Israel because of her adultery, but that
[17:28] treacherous sister Judah had no fear.
[17:31] And now she too has left me and given
[17:33] herself to prostitution.
[17:35] Israel treated it so lightly. She
[17:37] thought nothing of committing adultery
[17:39] by worshiping idols made of wood and
[17:40] stone. So now the land has been
[17:42] polluted. But despite all this, her
[17:45] faithless sister Judah has never
[17:47] sincerely returned to me. She has only
[17:50] pretended to be sorry. I the Lord have
[17:53] spoken.
[17:56] And so here we have the Lord making
[17:59] about the same par comparison. You know
[18:02] that here's Israel has been given the
[18:04] word of the Lord for their day, given
[18:06] clear understanding, given the prophets
[18:08] to teach them what the the the
[18:12] commandments of the Lord might be and to
[18:15] keep them on the path. And they didn't
[18:16] listen and instead chose to worship the
[18:18] works of their own hands and to build
[18:22] some other religion,
[18:23] you know, that didn't that was more
[18:26] convenient, more, you know, maybe it
[18:29] looked better to the rest of the world.
[18:31] and the rest of the world didn't kind of
[18:33] curl their lip when they, you know,
[18:35] walked by and didn't call them mean
[18:38] names so much and, you know, was maybe
[18:41] more likely to do business with them
[18:43] and, you know, it was financially
[18:45] expedient to do these things,
[18:47] you know, and so the Lord here is he's
[18:51] he's calling Israel, look, you're you're
[18:54] exchanging
[18:57] all the effort that I put out and I
[19:00] called you my people and that you don't
[19:02] care.
[19:03] You know, you've turned your back and
[19:04] you've you've exchanged
[19:06] the word that I wanted to put in your
[19:08] heart
[19:09] for some other thing, you know.
[19:13] And so then I come down to
[19:16] Genesis 4 verse one
[19:22] says, "And Adam knew Eve his wife, and
[19:25] she conceived and bare Cain
[19:27] and said, I have gotten a man from the
[19:29] Lord." And she again bare his brother
[19:32] Abel.
[19:34] And Abel was a keeper of sheep. But Cain
[19:37] was a tiller of the ground.
[19:39] And in process of time it came to pass
[19:41] that Cain brought of the fruit of the
[19:43] ground an offering unto the Lord.
[19:46] And Abel he also brought of the
[19:48] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[19:50] thereof. And the Lord had respect unto
[19:52] Abel and under and unto his offering.
[19:55] But unto Cain and to his offering he had
[19:57] no respect. And Cain was very wroth, and
[20:00] his countenance fell. And the Lord said
[20:03] unto Cain, "Why art thou wroth? Why is
[20:05] thy countenance fallen? If thou dost
[20:08] well,
[20:09] shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou
[20:12] dost not well, sin lith at the door, and
[20:16] unto thee shall be his desire, and thou
[20:19] shalt rule over him."
[20:23] So here we see a comparison. You see
[20:27] God's chosen one, Abel, making the
[20:30] sacrifice that God, you know, that in
[20:32] line with the order of God's word, and
[20:34] it was accepted
[20:35] and there was atonement there.
[20:37] But then here's Cain who's trying to
[20:41] worship the work of his own hands,
[20:43] trying to worship something that wasn't
[20:45] in line with the order of God's word.
[20:47] God didn't accept it. Didn't mean
[20:49] nothing, you know. It it it just made a
[20:52] bunch of smoke. didn't actually cover
[20:54] nothing. No sins were atoned for.
[20:58] But Abel's sins were covered.
[21:01] Why? Because it was in line with the
[21:03] with the word of God.
[21:04] That's right.
[21:06] Well,
[21:09] then we come down
[21:14] to the previous verse, Genesis 3 and
[21:16] verse 6, and it says, "When the woman
[21:19] saw that the tree was good for food, and
[21:22] that it was pleasant to the eye, and a
[21:24] tree to be desired to make one wise, she
[21:27] took of the fruit thereof and did eat,
[21:28] and give also unto her husband with
[21:30] her." And he did and he did eat. The
[21:34] eyes of them both were open and they
[21:35] knew that they were naked and they sewed
[21:37] fig leaves together and made themselves
[21:40] aprons
[21:42] unto Adam.
[21:44] Oh no, that's sorry that's where I want
[21:46] to stop there.
[21:48] So here's
[21:50] here's Adam and Eve original sin.
[21:53] All more or less aware of what this is a
[21:56] story about, right? It's not it's
[21:59] necessarily a story about eating an
[22:00] apple.
[22:02] Amen. But we know, so if you're
[22:04] noticing,
[22:06] there's a type here. This is a this is a
[22:09] thread that's running all the way
[22:10] through the Bible. Every single
[22:13] instance, and I actually want to go back
[22:15] and pick something up with with Cain and
[22:18] Abel here, right? Because every single
[22:21] instance that I've read here is a is God
[22:24] making a reference to sin as a form of
[22:27] adultery or spiritual fornication. Every
[22:29] single instance. And I'm going to show
[22:31] that to you in in with Cain and Abel
[22:33] here. Right? So it says in verse 7 of uh
[22:36] chapter 4. Um I'll read it in the King
[22:39] James says, "If thou well, shalt thou
[22:41] not be accepted. And if thou does not
[22:43] well, sin lith at the door, and unto
[22:45] thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt
[22:47] rule over him." Um if you read that same
[22:49] verse from Strongs, and you just kind of
[22:53] read it through, it says, "If you do
[22:55] what is right, will you not be accepted?
[22:58] But if you refuse to do what is right,
[23:01] sin is crouching at your door
[23:04] and you are as its object of desire.
[23:07] Wow.
[23:08] But you must master it. Now that that
[23:11] phrase its object of desire is actually
[23:14] a Hebrew word and this is Strong's. It's
[23:16] one Hebrew word. This is Strong's
[23:19] definition of that of that word which I
[23:21] can't pronounce because I ain't gonna
[23:23] try. Um
[23:25] it says
[23:29] that that word that phrase object desire
[23:31] means desire, longing, craving of a man
[23:36] for a woman, of a woman for a man
[23:40] or of a beast to devour.
[23:44] And so here's God saying sin is at your
[23:46] door and it has a particular kind of
[23:49] desire for you
[23:51] of the sort of desire a man would have
[23:53] for a woman or vice versa. This is not
[23:56] and so what he's saying to Cain is Cain,
[24:01] you better watch out because there's
[24:03] you're you're on the brink of doing the
[24:05] same thing your parents did.
[24:07] Right?
[24:08] You're g I'm giving you the chance now
[24:10] to stop.
[24:12] Right? Giving you the chance now to
[24:14] repent,
[24:16] to recognize that what you've done isn't
[24:18] right.
[24:19] It's it's it's not right. And you've got
[24:21] a chance to admit your fault and and go
[24:24] the other way.
[24:27] Because when you look at Adam and Eve,
[24:29] you know, the first thing they do,
[24:32] first thing they do when they sin is
[24:35] they immediately recognize their
[24:36] nakedness, right? They immediately
[24:37] recognize, they become self-conscious.
[24:38] They become immediately self-aware
[24:41] and their consciousness is pricking
[24:42] them. Oh heavens, what have we done?
[24:46] We've sinned and they're immediately
[24:49] ashamed of what they've done and they
[24:51] know it.
[24:52] And so they try to make a covering, try
[24:55] to cover up what they did and hide. So
[24:57] they're they don't have to look at it
[24:58] anymore
[24:59] because it's it's stinging their heart a
[25:01] little bit.
[25:03] And so, you know, brother Brandham
[25:05] called that that that that fig leaf,
[25:08] called it religion.
[25:09] It's type of religion
[25:11] because that's what people do.
[25:13] We'll go out and we'll get, you know,
[25:14] we'll get a little bit, you know, we'll
[25:16] we'll do something wrong. But instead of
[25:18] going, "Ah, I'm going to change and go
[25:21] the other way. We'll just cover her up a
[25:23] little bit. We'll go get a little bit of
[25:24] religion. We'll go to church. You know,
[25:26] we'll we'll, you know, make sure that we
[25:29] sing extra loud on Wednesday night. you
[25:30] know, we'll clap our hands extra in
[25:32] rhythm and you know, it's
[25:36] you know, it's like, you know, we're
[25:37] going to we're going to read an extra
[25:39] scripture that day or something. I don't
[25:41] know. The point is people get real
[25:42] religious when they're think they're
[25:44] doing wrong
[25:45] because their conscience is pricking
[25:46] them
[25:50] because they're trying to cover it up.
[25:51] Got themselves some fig leaves,
[25:54] you know, and that's what all through
[25:56] history has been. And see, but the the
[25:59] problem with the fig leaves is it didn't
[26:03] really hide anything. The reason why it
[26:06] wasn't in line with with the
[26:09] the uh the the program of God is because
[26:13] with sin, something's got to die, right?
[26:15] There's got to be some blood.
[26:17] It's got to hurt.
[26:19] Doesn't really hurt too bad to trim a
[26:21] fig tree and make get some leaves.
[26:23] But, you know, you look at you look at
[26:24] Cain and Abel. Cain had fig leaf
[26:26] religion, too. Right? He's burning
[26:29] plants.
[26:30] See, and I think the reason why, you
[26:32] know, when you're looking at Cain and
[26:33] Abel
[26:36] with Cain,
[26:38] he goes out there and gets some crops
[26:39] and he he burns them and goes, "Oh, you
[26:41] know, what I've done is so is so nice
[26:42] and it's, oh, it's a real sacrifice to
[26:44] give up this barrel of grain and some
[26:47] apples and whatever it was that he had."
[26:51] But with Abel, he's a shepherd.
[26:54] And shepherds spend a lot of time
[26:57] raising their sheep. And they loved
[26:58] their sheep very dearly.
[27:01] You know,
[27:02] David loved his sheep enough to go fight
[27:03] lions and bears to keep those sheep
[27:05] safe.
[27:07] Can't imagine Abel felt about the same
[27:09] way about his sheep.
[27:10] And he loved those sheep. And it's the
[27:12] firstborn. It It's the the the uh if we
[27:16] if we read that um pull it up again,
[27:21] see here. And it says, um,
[27:25] "And Abel, he also brought the
[27:27] firstlings of his flock,
[27:29] the one his first ones, the ones he
[27:32] started with,
[27:33] right? his the ones that he he cared
[27:36] about like they were the the first ones.
[27:39] And he gets his his this sheep that's
[27:42] been with him the longest
[27:45] and he has to take it over to a big old
[27:47] boulder and he puts it on that boulder
[27:49] and he looks it in the eye and takes a
[27:51] big sharp rock and starts hacking its
[27:53] throat out and blood starts going
[27:55] everywhere and that sheep starts
[27:57] screaming because it ain't a fun time.
[27:59] Amen.
[28:00] And it's screaming and crying and
[28:01] kicking and Abel's got tears running
[28:03] down his face going, I have to do this
[28:07] because of everything that I've done to
[28:09] make this sheep die.
[28:12] It wasn't my sins aren't just something
[28:15] insignificant cuz this animal that I
[28:17] love so much has to die and I've got to
[28:20] kill it.
[28:22] Amen.
[28:22] I've got to look it in the eye and know
[28:24] that he is suffering because of me. And
[28:28] that thing is screaming and bleeding and
[28:30] it is a mess and it it's misery.
[28:34] And so the next time when Abel walks
[28:36] away from that sacrifice soaked in the
[28:38] blood of his own of that sacrifice, he's
[28:41] he's not going back to what he did
[28:43] before.
[28:44] It hurt too much.
[28:46] The next time he is approached by that
[28:48] temptation, he's going to go, "No,
[28:52] a another sheep doesn't need to die for
[28:54] this.
[28:56] I'm not doing the same thing twice.
[28:59] You know,
[29:00] maybe it'll be something a different day
[29:02] and a different sheep will have to die,
[29:03] but not for the same thing,
[29:06] you know.
[29:08] But Cain,
[29:09] they ain't no heart, no heartstrings
[29:11] being pulled in that sacrifice.
[29:14] He's burning some popery. It smells
[29:17] nice. Like,
[29:19] come on.
[29:20] This isn't there's no there's no
[29:22] unpleasantness in that. It's kind of a
[29:25] good time really.
[29:26] Matter of fact, maybe he wants to send
[29:28] more just so he can excuse to do it. I
[29:30] don't know. The point is there's
[29:32] nothing. There's no bite to that
[29:35] sacrifice.
[29:37] Doesn't there's no
[29:38] no cost.
[29:39] No cost. It it doesn't cost him nothing.
[29:43] No skin in the game.
[29:46] That's good.
[29:49] And so, you know,
[29:54] that's what people do,
[29:57] unfortunately.
[29:58] That's what people do.
[30:01] We want our we want our fig leaf. We
[30:04] want our our thing that, you know, we
[30:06] can sort of acknowledge that, okay,
[30:08] maybe we didn't we shouldn't have done
[30:09] that, but you know, well, here's our
[30:12] little justification or maybe, you know,
[30:14] and because the thing is this whole
[30:17] thing is a is, you know, different forms
[30:19] of fornication. You look at you look at
[30:22] um
[30:24] in Jeremiah, you know, people are making
[30:26] idols worshiping the sticks and stones
[30:29] and
[30:31] I'm sure you know we've all heard that
[30:32] that doesn't mean sticks and stones
[30:35] necessarily. You know, doesn't mean that
[30:38] you went out and carved a statue to
[30:40] Molech,
[30:41] right? Maybe you just haven't read your
[30:45] Bible in a month
[30:47] and
[30:49] certainly wouldn't miss checking
[30:51] whatever it is on your phone, right?
[30:54] Certainly won't miss the latest, I don't
[30:57] know, Daily Wire podcast, you know,
[31:00] certainly won't miss the the last, you
[31:02] know, Tucker Carlson or, you know, the
[31:06] latest NFL game or, you know, won't miss
[31:09] whatever it is. I don't know, you know.
[31:12] You've got your streaming service that
[31:13] you'll binge watch, but you won't pick
[31:16] up your Bible.
[31:19] Oh, you've got a nice idol there. It's
[31:21] real pretty.
[31:22] You got all the glitz and glamour of
[31:23] Hollywood on it.
[31:25] Amen.
[31:25] You know, but
[31:29] where's God?
[31:31] you know,
[31:32] and it's
[31:34] and then we'll say, "Oh, well, you know,
[31:36] I we'll we'll go get us some feel-good
[31:39] scriptures." Kind of pat ourselves on
[31:40] the head and say, "Oh, well, you know,
[31:43] it's all right. I got my fig leaf." And
[31:45] I mean, after all, look, I go to Mesa
[31:46] Church.
[31:47] I go to Mesa Church. I got designer fig
[31:50] leaves. Gucci Versace fig leaves,
[31:54] right?
[31:56] like this is, you know, like like we're
[31:59] some it's some kind of special covering.
[32:03] No,
[32:04] it's not.
[32:05] You're you're just as naked before God
[32:07] as anybody else.
[32:13] The only thing that God recognizes that
[32:15] is that shed blood of a lamb.
[32:17] It's all that's there,
[32:19] right? It's that atonement.
[32:23] And you know, I
[32:25] I, you know, thinking of this, it's kind
[32:27] of hard. You might be thinking, "What in
[32:30] the world is that text have happened to
[32:31] any of this?" Um,
[32:34] but the reality is
[32:37] everybody's put on fig leaves at some
[32:39] point.
[32:40] I have, you have, everyone does at some
[32:43] point.
[32:45] Everyone's fallen short. Everyone's
[32:48] righteousness is filthy rags.
[32:51] Nobody's innocent.
[32:54] And
[32:56] there's,
[33:00] you know, there's a there's a tendency
[33:02] for people to um
[33:05] to kind of,
[33:09] you know, we we maybe maybe people would
[33:11] would, you know, go do live all carnally
[33:14] and and forget God basically except when
[33:16] they're at church and then think, oh,
[33:19] well, you know, I I It's there's a
[33:23] certain kind of atonement or whatever.
[33:25] God shed his blood for me. I'm all
[33:26] right. All right. Okay. Well,
[33:29] you know that that story that Brother
[33:31] Bam tells about pardon. Um how there's a
[33:33] young man, he's he's in jail. Um I
[33:35] believe he deserted and during the Civil
[33:38] War and you know, he got scared all the
[33:39] can of fire got just panicked him and he
[33:41] and he took off and and ran away. And um
[33:44] his friend went to President Lincoln and
[33:47] um was trying to get him pardoned
[33:48] because they were going to hang him for
[33:49] desertion. and um his friend went to
[33:52] President Lincoln and said, "You know,
[33:54] my friend, he he he just he just
[33:56] panicked at the wrong moment and and now
[33:57] they're going to hang him. You know, Mr.
[33:58] President, could you please find it in
[33:59] your heart to write him a pardon?" And
[34:02] but the time's short. You know, they're
[34:03] going to hang him like tomorrow morning
[34:04] and and you know, we got to So, we
[34:07] time's short and President Lincoln I
[34:10] think he pulled a napkin out of his
[34:11] pocket and and and wrote the pardon on
[34:13] the back of a napkin and and the friend
[34:15] runs to the jail and he's showing the
[34:17] friend, "Hey, they pardoned you and his
[34:19] friends like, "I ain't taking that.
[34:21] That's a joke. You didn't go to
[34:23] President Lincoln. Ain't no way you went
[34:24] to President Lincoln cuz And I know you
[34:26] didn't go to Pres because it's written
[34:27] on a napkin, right? It's I mean, come
[34:29] on." And besides, his handwriting
[34:31] doesn't look as good as it ought to. And
[34:33] it's like, "No, he actually wrote this.
[34:35] I watched him write it." It's like, "No,
[34:37] President, if it came from the
[34:38] president, it'd be a nice fancy paper
[34:39] with a nice pretty seal and it' be like
[34:41] embossed or something,
[34:44] but it was a part." And so, he rejected
[34:45] the pardon. He wouldn't take it because
[34:46] he thought it was a joke.
[34:47] Yeah. and they hung him and he was he
[34:52] didn't have to be hung,
[34:54] but it wasn't pretty enough, right? It
[34:56] didn't didn't meet what he thought it
[34:58] might look like.
[34:59] Yeah.
[35:00] So,
[35:02] I I was studying about that and I wanted
[35:04] to find the, you know, because I heard
[35:05] brother Brandon tell the story a lot and
[35:06] I I wanted to um find like the original
[35:09] maybe like a source document or
[35:11] something, you know, and I'm starting
[35:13] to, as I'm trying to do some research
[35:15] and find it, I come across this other
[35:18] um
[35:20] this other uh Supreme Court case because
[35:24] the the the the
[35:27] moral of that story was they had
[35:28] ultimately gone to the Supreme court cuz
[35:29] somebody because the lawyers got a hold
[35:30] of him and said, "Well, we have a
[35:32] problem here because the president
[35:33] pardoned this man yet we hung him. So,
[35:36] what do we do?" And so it went to the
[35:38] Supreme Court and the Supreme Court
[35:39] said, "Well,
[35:41] um, a pardon's only a pardon if it's
[35:43] accepted as a pardon. It's got to be
[35:45] accepted otherwise it's no good.
[35:47] Um, it's
[35:48] okay." And so,
[35:51] um,
[35:56] so I got to I got to looking into this
[35:58] and there was another court case that
[35:59] happened later and it was a it was a man
[36:02] there was they were considering um he
[36:05] was accused of some crimes and different
[36:07] things or no I'm sorry he was um he was
[36:09] testifying in court and he didn't want
[36:11] to testify even though he was compelled
[36:13] to by law but he didn't want to testify
[36:14] because he was afraid that if he
[36:15] testified it would incriminate him in
[36:18] some his some of his own crimes like
[36:20] that. And so, uh, President Wilson had
[36:23] written him a pardon that basically if
[36:25] he testified, he the pardon would cover
[36:27] any, um, any crimes that he would be
[36:31] implicated in during the testimony
[36:34] because I guess the person he was
[36:35] testifying against was a much bigger
[36:36] fish to fry. So,
[36:40] but then he there was some without
[36:43] getting too many too much into the
[36:44] details because lawyers make things very
[36:46] complicated. Um,
[36:49] So, it ultimately went to the Supreme
[36:50] Court. And so, this is an excerpt from
[36:52] that Supreme Court decision because
[36:53] they're they're they're trying to
[36:55] decide, well, if you The problem with
[36:58] pardoning someone
[37:01] when they've never actually admitted to
[37:03] a crime and they're not on trial and
[37:05] they've not been convicted of anything
[37:06] is that a pardon isn't amnesty.
[37:10] Okay? Amnesty is like, "Well, we don't
[37:13] know if you did anything, but if you
[37:14] did, we won't prosecute."
[37:17] A pardon is not that, right?
[37:22] And
[37:25] so, I'm going to I'm going to read a
[37:26] little bit of this of the Supreme what
[37:27] the Supreme Court wrote here about this
[37:29] case
[37:31] and then hopefully try to
[37:34] explain it. says, quote, "A pardon is an
[37:38] act of grace proceeding from the power
[37:41] entrusted with the execution of the laws
[37:44] which exempts the individual on whom it
[37:47] is bestowed from the punishment the law
[37:50] inflicts for a crime he has committed.
[37:53] It is the private
[37:56] though official act of the executive
[37:58] magistrate delivered to the individual
[38:01] for whose benefit it is intended.
[38:05] Now that's fancy way of saying
[38:08] pardon is an act of grace on the behalf
[38:11] of a sovereign to somebody who has been
[38:13] convicted of a crime
[38:16] to make them no longer subject to the
[38:19] penalty of that crime.
[38:21] Right.
[38:24] The problem here and this is this is
[38:26] where where it got complicated is way
[38:29] court works is if you're accused of
[38:32] something
[38:33] right the police say you done it and you
[38:35] say you go to you have what's called an
[38:37] arraignment right you come before the
[38:38] judge and the judge asks you how do you
[38:41] plead and you can say guilty or not
[38:44] guilty
[38:46] if you say guilty you are saying the
[38:49] police are right I did it at At that
[38:52] point, you are declared guilty. There's
[38:54] no need for a trial. The police, you
[38:56] know, the the the government says you
[38:58] did it. You say you did it. You did it.
[39:01] Off to the penalty you go.
[39:04] There's no need for for a trial.
[39:07] But if you say not guilty, I didn't do
[39:10] it. I'm innocent.
[39:12] Then the court has to have a trial,
[39:13] right?
[39:14] Because they're saying, well, the police
[39:16] say you did it, but you're saying you
[39:18] not you didn't do it. So now we're going
[39:19] to have to get a bunch of get a jury
[39:20] together and we're going to have to have
[39:21] a courtroom and then you're going to
[39:22] have to come in here and everyone's
[39:23] going to present evidence and at the end
[39:25] of the evidence if a jury of your peers
[39:28] has enough evidence to say you did it or
[39:30] didn't do it then they'll decide and
[39:31] that's that's that right?
[39:34] And so the problem is the reason why
[39:36] this got kind of sticky is the guy had
[39:39] never even been accused of a crime.
[39:41] And as far as the court is concerned,
[39:44] you are innocent until proven guilty.
[39:47] Until you went either until you admitted
[39:49] guilt or a court, a jury said you were
[39:52] guilty,
[39:53] you're innocent,
[39:55] right?
[39:56] And so you got to have a trial and to
[39:59] determine that. And this guy had never
[40:02] been to trial. He'd never even been
[40:04] accused. As far as the court's
[40:06] concerned, he's innocent. You can't
[40:07] pardon an innocent person.
[40:09] It's for the guilty.
[40:11] It's not for the innocent.
[40:13] Amnesty is for somebody who's assumed
[40:15] innocent. Pardon is for somebody who's
[40:17] known to be guilty.
[40:20] And so
[40:24] they they came down. And so when they're
[40:26] when they're they're discussing this,
[40:27] you know, they're saying this is an act
[40:28] of grace in the on behalf of a sovereign
[40:30] to a guilty party.
[40:32] But it says circumstances
[40:35] may be made to bring innocence under the
[40:39] penalties of the law.
[40:41] If so brought,
[40:43] escape by confession of guilt implied in
[40:47] the acceptance of a pardon may be
[40:50] rejected,
[40:52] preferring to be the victim of the law
[40:56] rather than its acknowledged
[40:58] transgressor, preferring death even to
[41:01] such certain infamy.
[41:04] Okay. So what the court is saying here
[41:06] is you could theoretically have somebody
[41:09] the reason why you have to allow people
[41:10] to reject their own pardon is because
[41:12] you might have someone who is accused of
[41:15] a really heinous crime and they'd rather
[41:18] be convicted in front of a jury and be
[41:20] sentenced maybe even to death
[41:24] and go to their own execution saying it
[41:28] was rigged. It was a kangaroo court. I'm
[41:30] innocent. I was framed. It's all a lie.
[41:32] I'm innocent. and be declaring their own
[41:35] innocence right until the end
[41:40] because they would rather
[41:42] be con seen as a victim of an unjust
[41:45] system
[41:46] than acknowledge their own guilt
[41:48] and say I'm wrong
[41:51] right because if you accept the pardon
[41:52] it means you did it
[41:54] right means you're guilty
[41:59] and this is the problem
[42:02] too many times times Christians
[42:07] would rather
[42:09] declare their own innocence and say,
[42:12] "Uh, it's not so bad.
[42:15] Is it really that big of a deal?" You
[42:18] know, you know, if you eat of the fruit,
[42:21] thou shalt not surely die. This is small
[42:25] things. We've got our pet carnality or
[42:29] our pet sin or our pet thing that well,
[42:32] you know, you got like a scripture or a
[42:34] quote that you kind of take a belt sand
[42:35] or two and sand all the context off of
[42:38] it to kind of shoehorn it into your
[42:40] particular situation so that you can,
[42:43] you know, wedge yourself into some sort
[42:45] of thing and say, "Well, I've got my
[42:47] defense, judge. I'll come before the
[42:49] judge and make my defense."
[42:52] Well, here's the thing.
[42:54] There's one courtroom that you're going
[42:56] to be in front of,
[42:58] right? Everyone
[43:00] right now, you're in a you're in
[43:01] arraignment right now. There's a
[43:04] courtroom coming.
[43:05] Right? Ain't here yet.
[43:08] So the judge is you're in front of the
[43:10] judge and the judge is saying, "Are you
[43:11] innocent or are you guilty? Did you sin
[43:14] or are you trying to plead your own
[43:15] innocence?"
[43:16] Cuz if you say, "I'm guilty." Well, we
[43:19] don't need a trial. Right?
[43:20] We can call you guilty right now and
[43:22] then you can have a pardon.
[43:25] Right? There's a pardon if you want to
[43:26] accept your guilt,
[43:28] but if you want to say, "No, I'm going
[43:30] to I'm I can justify my nonsense."
[43:33] Okay,
[43:35] go ahead. You're guilty in front. You're
[43:37] innocent in front of the court until
[43:38] proven guilty. You'll get your day in
[43:40] court. Don't worry.
[43:43] You know, the the great white throne
[43:45] judgment is very impartial.
[43:48] and he will take your argument as
[43:50] serious as it actually is, which
[43:52] probably isn't very
[43:55] in reality because the truth of the
[43:57] matter is,
[44:00] you know, when you're wrong.
[44:02] God's not judging you based on, you
[44:05] know, what kind of logic you can bring.
[44:09] He's judging you based on your heart.
[44:12] And you might be able to lie to a a
[44:14] human judge and jury, you ain't lying to
[44:17] God. And when you're on in front of that
[44:20] judge, you ain't even lying to yourself
[44:22] no more,
[44:23] right?
[44:27] So
[44:35] I guess, you know, my here I am and I'm
[44:39] thinking about this and I
[44:42] It's it's it's kind of hard to think in
[44:46] these terms. You know, I I promise you
[44:48] anything that I say behind the pulpit,
[44:49] I've aimed at myself a whole lot more
[44:52] than anybody else. And um
[44:56] you know, you look at yourself in the
[44:57] mirror a lot of times and it's really
[44:59] hard,
[45:01] really hard to look at that and go,
[45:04] "Yeah, I'm going to make it."
[45:07] You know,
[45:10] but see
[45:13] the consolation is
[45:16] God never expected you to be perfect.
[45:18] He just expected you to admit when you
[45:20] weren't,
[45:22] right?
[45:23] It's not It's not about you being
[45:27] perfect.
[45:29] It's about you being willing.
[45:34] All right, look. the fig leaf religion.
[45:38] That's your that's Adam and Eve trying
[45:40] to make their own case for innocence.
[45:42] It's Cain's attempt at making his own
[45:44] case for innocence. It's, you know, ah,
[45:47] I'm okay. I got something to cover my
[45:49] sins.
[45:51] Okay, it's a bad legal argument and it's
[45:54] not going to work.
[45:56] And that's but the problem is so you
[45:58] notice when at the end of the story with
[46:01] Adam and Eve and Adam and Eve get kicked
[46:03] out the garden and they're walking away.
[46:05] Huh? Have you ever heard brother
[46:06] Brandham tell that story? Adam and Eve,
[46:09] you know, hanging their heads,
[46:11] heartbroken, walking out of that garden
[46:13] and knowing like, "What have we done?"
[46:16] Cuz they and it's not like they didn't
[46:17] know that the rest of that they were
[46:18] going to have children, the rest of
[46:20] humanity was going to suffer because of
[46:21] them. Oh, they knew full well. You know,
[46:23] they're they're going, "Oh, we have just
[46:24] doomed everyone."
[46:27] And you know, the bloody lamb skkins
[46:30] that because God had to make an
[46:32] atonement or he had to kill him.
[46:34] So, what did he do? He killed the lamb
[46:35] and he put that that nasty messy I mean
[46:39] you ever seen a raw hide? It's
[46:43] it's a mess.
[46:45] But it was it covered them.
[46:47] It was a mess, but it was a in the sight
[46:50] of God. It was a whole lot better than
[46:51] some, you know, Gucci fig leaves.
[46:55] And
[46:58] you know that
[47:01] atonement
[47:06] it it you know it wasn't about what they
[47:08] did
[47:10] because God knew you know God it's not
[47:13] like when God made Adam and Eve he
[47:14] didn't know what they were going to do.
[47:16] You know, I I I think about
[47:19] think about Samson,
[47:24] you know, when the first thing you read
[47:25] about Samson is actually when angel came
[47:27] to his parents and told him, you know,
[47:32] he's going to be a great deliverer and
[47:33] he's going to do all these things.
[47:36] God didn't mention the part where he was
[47:38] going to chase a bunch of Philistine
[47:39] women and you know uh he was going to uh
[47:44] end up with a finding a prostitute in in
[47:46] in uh what's the city called? I can't
[47:50] remember now. Gaza. Thank you. Um you
[47:52] know didn't mention that part. Didn't
[47:53] mention the part where he's going to mil
[47:54] marry some Philistine woman. Didn't
[47:56] mention the part where he was going to
[47:57] go you know still be stuck on Philistine
[47:59] women and end up with Delilah. You know
[48:01] didn't didn't mention any of that. He
[48:02] just said he was going to be a mighty,
[48:04] you know, deliverer.
[48:06] And you think, well, did did God did God
[48:10] not know? Was he, you know, oh man, I
[48:12] got this extra covenant to make today,
[48:14] and who I'm give to I'll give it to that
[48:15] guy. He looks all right.
[48:17] No, it's not how God operates.
[48:20] God knew Samson's in from his beginning.
[48:22] He knew what he was going to do.
[48:25] Didn't matter. He still did it. Still
[48:27] gave. He still chose Samson. Yeah.
[48:32] You know, and you know, did he when when
[48:36] we've been reading, me and Kate have
[48:39] been reading um
[48:41] uh uh through the life of David and
[48:44] we're just getting into the beginning of
[48:45] it and you know, here comes here comes
[48:48] Samuel and it, you know, goes through
[48:50] all the all the brothers and said, "No,
[48:52] I want the I want that one. You know, go
[48:54] out in the field and get me that give me
[48:55] that, you know, scrawny little sheep
[48:57] herder. He's gonna be the king because
[48:59] God said he's going to be the king. And
[49:00] you know, God told Samuel that that's
[49:02] the one. When God told that to Samuel,
[49:05] was he unaware of what David would do?
[49:09] Was he unaware that David would
[49:10] eventually murder one of his very best
[49:12] friends just to have an affair with his
[49:15] wife?
[49:17] Did Did God not know?
[49:19] Was he unaware?
[49:21] You know, did he just accidentally skip
[49:22] that part? You know, no. God knew
[49:25] exactly what he was doing. And when he
[49:28] knew that David would do that when he
[49:30] called him a man after his own heart,
[49:34] you know, because think about it. What
[49:37] was really the difference between Saul
[49:39] and David?
[49:41] David repented.
[49:43] When David was confronted by a prophet,
[49:46] he said, "Oh Lord, created me a clean
[49:50] heart. Do fix me. I'm a wretch. I don't
[49:54] want to be me no more. I I want to be
[49:57] different from this. I don't deliver me
[49:59] of this thing. But uh Saul was eh, you
[50:04] know, he he he just made excuses,
[50:06] you know. Oh, well, you know, the people
[50:09] went and got the animals and I didn't do
[50:11] it and I No, don't look at my fig
[50:14] leaves,
[50:14] you know. No,
[50:16] that's that's the difference because one
[50:18] would repent and the other one wouldn't.
[50:20] You know, that's what God's looking for.
[50:23] you know, you look at um
[50:26] and and furthermore, I don't know how I
[50:29] loop back around to that. Um the uh so
[50:33] I'm you know, we get this this you know,
[50:35] I'm thinking about this this idea that
[50:37] so many times we're looking at that at
[50:40] the person, at the flesh, at the us when
[50:43] we're in the mirror, you know, when
[50:44] we're sitting there feeling like David
[50:46] going, "Oh, what have I done that? I am
[50:49] just the worst.
[50:52] We look at this and we say, "Why would
[50:56] God pick me,
[50:59] right? Why would God pick this
[51:02] worm?"
[51:03] You know, of all the people God could
[51:05] have picked.
[51:06] I mean, why would, you know, if God's
[51:07] trying to create this this people, this
[51:09] chosen people that are going to be like
[51:11] rulers during the millennium and and sit
[51:14] on the throne, the judgment throne with
[51:16] him at the great white throne judgment.
[51:18] The Bible says you'll judge men and
[51:20] angels,
[51:21] right? But you will,
[51:23] and you're going, "Me? Why? Why couldn't
[51:26] you pick someone who got a doctorate in
[51:28] law?"
[51:29] You know, like, why couldn't you pick a
[51:30] Supreme Court justice to do that?
[51:33] Surely, he'd be better at it, you know?
[51:36] Why couldn't we Why did God pick a bunch
[51:38] of repbates,
[51:40] you know?
[51:42] Well, it's because God always picks the
[51:45] unlikely things, right? You know,
[51:51] God's not interested in what the outside
[51:54] looks like.
[51:56] You let scripture um know you not you
[51:58] are the temple.
[52:00] If you ever studied that out, you find
[52:02] that um you know the temple, the actual
[52:05] temple is a pattern of a human being.
[52:07] It's patterned after a human being,
[52:08] right? If you go back and look at the
[52:10] tabernacle,
[52:12] go back and look at the tabernacle in
[52:13] the wilderness. It's a tent, right? And
[52:15] ultimately that that same pattern became
[52:17] the the temple that Solomon built. Just
[52:20] looking at the looking at the tabernacle
[52:22] in the wilderness,
[52:25] there's this place where God dwells.
[52:29] Reminds me, I think, uh, was it you,
[52:31] brother Matt, that was talking about um,
[52:33] previously, you know, that God created
[52:35] the environment first and then created
[52:37] the animals within it. you know, he made
[52:38] the water so that he had the fi the
[52:40] fish, you know, fish fish had a fin on
[52:42] its back because he had the had the
[52:43] water. Um, I heard him preach that and
[52:45] it reminded me of the very very very
[52:47] first sermon I ever preached. Um, most
[52:50] of y'all have never heard it because it
[52:51] was at my dad's church in Flagstaff. um
[52:54] was the very first sermon I ever
[52:55] preached and that was that was my
[52:57] thought because it occurred to me that
[53:00] God had made the water and then he made
[53:03] the fish and then he made land and then
[53:04] he made trees and then he you know he's
[53:06] building an environment and once he made
[53:07] trees and grass then he made animals
[53:08] that could eat trees and grass and then
[53:09] they lived in that environment and then
[53:11] and then ultimately God made man and
[53:13] what it was is every stage was the setup
[53:16] for the next stage. Every stage that God
[53:19] made was to create an environment so
[53:21] that the next stage could live in it.
[53:23] you know, and then he got to people and
[53:26] then I thought, well, what were people
[53:29] made to be the environment for what to
[53:32] live in?
[53:34] Right.
[53:34] That's right.
[53:35] People were, you know, God made people
[53:38] because he wasn't looking for a place.
[53:40] He wasn't building the earth for a place
[53:42] that fish could live and he wasn't
[53:44] building an earth a place where trees
[53:45] could live. And he wasn't building the
[53:47] earth so that cows could live and that
[53:49] deer could live. And he wasn't even
[53:50] really building the the earth so that a
[53:52] place where people could live.
[53:54] Building the earth so it was a place
[53:55] where God could live. That was the that
[53:57] was the finished work there, right?
[54:00] That's where he was going. He was
[54:01] creating an environment so that the
[54:03] house that he would live in might live
[54:05] there,
[54:06] right? Because you are the temple,
[54:08] right? You're the you're the tabernacle
[54:09] that God lives in. And you look at the
[54:11] you look at the at the tabernacle,
[54:13] right? It's a it's a big tent. And
[54:16] inside of that tent is
[54:19] um an inside of the tent.
[54:22] It's a it's a it's a it's a um like a
[54:25] sanctuary, right? And then inside of
[54:26] that sanctuary is an inside of the
[54:29] inside, right? It's another layer inside
[54:32] of there. And that's where God lives.
[54:34] So what do we have? We have a body.
[54:35] That's your tent on the outside. Then
[54:36] you have a spirit. That's the area on
[54:38] the inside. And you have a soul and
[54:39] that's down on the inside of the inside,
[54:42] right?
[54:44] And so if you read in in uh
[54:48] let me pull this up um in Exodus 26:14
[54:53] and it says and this is God giving the
[54:55] destru u instructions instructions on
[54:58] how to assemble the tent right assemble
[55:01] this big big tent right and so this is
[55:04] the the tent covering
[55:07] and it says and thou shalt make a
[55:10] covering for the tent of ramkins skins
[55:13] dyed red and a covering above of badger
[55:18] skins.
[55:19] All right.
[55:21] So, what you have is a big tent and if
[55:23] you're standing on the outside of the
[55:24] tent, what you see is a big tent made
[55:27] out of badger skins,
[55:28] right? And you look at that and if you
[55:31] when I was a kid, I heard this, you
[55:33] know, because mom was very diligent in
[55:34] making sure that we read all the Bible
[55:36] when we were kids and I being remember
[55:37] being a little kid and like reading
[55:40] about when it says badger skins and I'm
[55:42] thinking like you know like the black
[55:43] and white badgers. I don't know did
[55:45] anybody read like the red wall books
[55:46] when they were kids, right? And think,
[55:49] oh the badgers, they're so cool. They're
[55:50] like these cool little critters that
[55:52] live under oak trees and they're
[55:53] awesome. No, that's not what it's
[55:56] talking about in the Bible. Those kind
[55:57] of badgers don't live there.
[55:59] What do live there are honey badgers. I
[56:02] don't know if anybody knows what a
[56:03] honeybger is.
[56:06] They've made a name for themselves.
[56:09] Honey badgers are vicious and nasty.
[56:14] They're in the same family as weasels,
[56:16] skunks, and wolverines. In fact, they
[56:18] are very closely related to wolverines.
[56:19] They're basically like a Middle Eastern
[56:20] African version of a wolverine. They are
[56:23] notorious. They will chase African main
[56:25] lions off of their kills. They will
[56:29] they're immune to snake venom,
[56:32] which is an interesting thought and
[56:33] someone might ought to preach on
[56:34] sometime that the the tabernacle that
[56:36] God chose to build his house out of was
[56:38] immune to to serpents.
[56:41] Um the
[56:44] these things are vicious. They stink.
[56:46] They spray like a skunk. They they can
[56:48] spray like a skunk. They stink and it
[56:50] doesn't wash off.
[56:52] And they're called honey badgers because
[56:54] they rip open the nest of African killer
[56:55] bees and eat the honey because their
[56:57] hide is so thick that they can't be
[57:00] stung. And their fur is so bristly and
[57:02] thick that it's almost like a defense
[57:03] mechanism. Other animals don't want to
[57:04] bite them because their fur is so stiff
[57:06] it pricks the roof of their mouth. They
[57:08] are unpleasant. They are rough. They are
[57:10] vicious. They are every single thing
[57:13] that you would think God wouldn't want.
[57:17] Right? Like you look at a honey badger
[57:19] and you think, "Wow, that is the
[57:20] embodiment of Satan."
[57:23] And God said, "Yes, that guy.
[57:27] That's the one that's going to make my
[57:29] house."
[57:32] And it stank.
[57:37] You can't wash it off,
[57:41] you know. And so here they have a huge
[57:42] this tabernacle that that God dwells in
[57:45] that you can smell from 100 yards.
[57:49] And it's just not a you think why?
[57:52] Well, it's because God knew who's going
[57:55] to live inside of people. The only thing
[57:57] that stinks probably worse than a
[57:58] honeybger is probably a people.
[58:01] You know, in reality, people are awful.
[58:04] We are, you know, at their worst. They
[58:06] are they are at least a honeybadger
[58:08] doesn't know any better
[58:10] you know people do
[58:12] people know better and we do it anyways
[58:16] and
[58:18] you know and so and you look at you look
[58:20] at this the way this tabernacle is built
[58:22] you know there's this inside of the
[58:23] inside this holiest of holies where God
[58:25] lives
[58:26] and you know when they built this
[58:27] there's a veil there to separate to
[58:30] partition and you know
[58:33] you know God was in that behind hair.
[58:37] And when the when the priest would go
[58:38] through that veil, if he had any sin in
[58:40] his life, any at all, he'd drop dead,
[58:42] right? Had to have bells on his on the
[58:44] hymn of his garment so that if they ever
[58:46] heard it stop ringing, they could drag
[58:47] his carcass out,
[58:48] right? Cuz you can't go in there unless
[58:53] why? Because you're entering the
[58:54] presence of the tree of life.
[58:56] And when Adam and Eve left that garden,
[58:58] there was a flaming sword there
[59:00] that said they couldn't come back to the
[59:01] tree of life. Humanity can't come back
[59:03] because if because you can't bring sin
[59:05] into the presence of God. If you do, you
[59:07] fall over dead.
[59:12] Which is interesting to me because the
[59:13] holiest of holies is the type of the
[59:14] human soul.
[59:15] Yeah.
[59:17] Odd. That kind of implies that the tree
[59:20] of life lives in your soul, doesn't it?
[59:22] Yeah.
[59:23] You know,
[59:24] kind of. But you know, there was a time
[59:26] when this tabernacle was built, there's
[59:27] a partition there. petition that says
[59:30] you can't go from your spirit down to
[59:32] your soul. There's a barrier. Yeah.
[59:35] And
[59:37] what happens is the badger skin, it's
[59:39] out in the weather and you can't control
[59:40] the weather and it some days it rains
[59:43] and then the badger skin gets wet and
[59:45] then then it blows wind and it blows
[59:48] dust everywhere and now the badger skin
[59:50] is muddy and then you know maybe it
[59:53] rains again. kind of cleans up and then
[59:54] it gets really hot and it gets all dry
[59:57] and crackly and you know it's all dried
[59:59] out and it's stiff cuz leather gets
[1:00:01] stiff in the sun and then and then it
[1:00:03] gets really cold and it's just it's the
[1:00:05] the skin the badger skin on the outside
[1:00:08] the flesh out here. This guy has
[1:00:12] circumstances that make him dirty or
[1:00:14] clean or whatever and he's going to go
[1:00:16] through life and he can't really do a
[1:00:17] lot about that.
[1:00:18] Your your flesh is going to get dirty,
[1:00:21] right?
[1:00:24] the spirit have a little more control
[1:00:26] over that, right? It's internal. It's
[1:00:27] not necessarily fluctuating with the
[1:00:30] weather so much,
[1:00:32] but it's only illuminated by oil and
[1:00:35] lamps. Sometimes if you don't take a
[1:00:37] good job, make it take care keeping
[1:00:39] those lamps lit and the fire burning, it
[1:00:42] gets dark
[1:00:43] and it gets smoky and you can't really
[1:00:45] see a lot and it gets unpleasant to be
[1:00:48] in your spirit. and you know maybe it
[1:00:50] gets cold the outside gets cold the it's
[1:00:52] a tent it's not got central AC um it's
[1:00:55] going to get cold or hot with the
[1:00:57] weather it's going to fluctuate now the
[1:00:59] soul that inside part that's constant
[1:01:03] there's a there's always light in that
[1:01:04] soul there's always fire in that soul
[1:01:07] it's never going to go out
[1:01:11] and so
[1:01:13] you know we look at our badger skins and
[1:01:15] we think
[1:01:18] you
[1:01:19] Why would
[1:01:22] God pick this? It's awful and wretched.
[1:01:26] And it's well, it's because God was
[1:01:28] living on the inside. People would come
[1:01:30] to the outside and go, "Wow, that badger
[1:01:32] skin is awful and it smells bad."
[1:01:36] And but God isn't on the outside. He's
[1:01:40] on the inside. And if you notice, the
[1:01:43] way it said is there was ram skin dyed
[1:01:46] red.
[1:01:48] It's a type of bloody ram skin
[1:01:51] that goes on the co on the tent first
[1:01:54] and then badger skin goes over the
[1:01:55] outside. So if you're on the outside
[1:01:58] looking in, you see ugly badger skins.
[1:02:01] If you're looking from God's
[1:02:02] perspective, all you see is bloody ram
[1:02:05] skin,
[1:02:07] right?
[1:02:08] You can look in the mirror all you want,
[1:02:10] but that's not God's perspective. You
[1:02:13] can look at your own faults and failures
[1:02:14] and say, "Oh, I'm just the worst." God
[1:02:17] doesn't see that. You know, when
[1:02:19] Samson's sitting there in the grindhouse
[1:02:22] grinding away going, "Oh, I failed. I
[1:02:24] failed. I gave up my my my covenant. I
[1:02:27] gave up my my vow." He's looking at his
[1:02:29] badger skin all day long. And he's
[1:02:31] going, "I deserve this." And if you're
[1:02:33] on the outside set, you go, "Yeah,
[1:02:34] Samson, you do."
[1:02:36] But if you're from and you know, but and
[1:02:38] then one day, you know, they drag him in
[1:02:39] front of everybody and he's feels those
[1:02:41] that covenant on the back of his head
[1:02:43] and he grabs a hold of it and he
[1:02:44] remembers his vow.
[1:02:47] And he says once more Lord and God heard
[1:02:50] it and met him on the basis of that vow.
[1:02:52] What it shows
[1:02:54] is that
[1:02:56] Samson left the covenant. God didn't.
[1:03:00] God was waiting for him as soon as he
[1:03:02] came back.
[1:03:04] Right?
[1:03:05] There's a mo because God only ever saw
[1:03:07] the covenant.
[1:03:08] He only ever saw the ramkins.
[1:03:11] You know the this is but
[1:03:16] And you know, and I I I
[1:03:21] in my um
[1:03:25] I
[1:03:27] had a one thing that impacted me a long
[1:03:30] time ago.
[1:03:32] There was a um
[1:03:34] it was a piece of basically poetry, but
[1:03:37] it's not really poetry that I heard I
[1:03:40] read a long time ago and always stuck
[1:03:43] with me.
[1:03:44] Did y'all get that PowerPoint?
[1:03:48] Um, what time is it? Yeah, it's about
[1:03:52] time to
[1:03:54] um do you It should be just two
[1:03:57] pictures. Put it up. So, it's a it's a
[1:04:00] power uh it's a this thing that I read
[1:04:03] was a um
[1:04:05] it's a bit from a book. I've never read
[1:04:07] the book. I more or less know what it's
[1:04:09] about, though. Um astronomer by the name
[1:04:11] of Carl Sean wrote this bit. Sean's kind
[1:04:13] of an atheist. I don't recommend him.
[1:04:16] But he wrote this bit of of kind of
[1:04:18] poetry and I want to get read in a
[1:04:21] minute, but create a little bit of basis
[1:04:23] for what I'm showing here.
[1:04:27] This is a picture um that Hubble Space
[1:04:29] Telescope took. I believe it was the
[1:04:32] late 90s. There was a um some
[1:04:34] scientists. They got this new satellite,
[1:04:36] super big telescope. They're looking at
[1:04:37] the stars and they see
[1:04:40] take a big picture and there's a spot on
[1:04:42] this picture where there's nothing.
[1:04:43] There's no stars at all. And they they
[1:04:46] say, "Okay, well, we could use a
[1:04:48] telescope to look at all these stars
[1:04:49] that we can see, but we want to look at
[1:04:50] that spot that there's nothing there,
[1:04:52] right? There's no nothing there." And so
[1:04:55] they zoomed this telescope in on that
[1:04:57] spot and they cranked and they they just
[1:04:59] let it expose for a very long time so
[1:05:01] that any little bit of starlight will
[1:05:03] get picked up. And on this spot that
[1:05:06] there was nothing there was that
[1:05:08] picture.
[1:05:10] Okay? Now you can't really see it from
[1:05:12] there but the vast majority at least 50%
[1:05:15] of those aren't stars. They are
[1:05:18] galaxies.
[1:05:20] Galaxies have hundreds of millions maybe
[1:05:23] billions of stars in them. There are
[1:05:25] probably more stars in that picture than
[1:05:27] you can see with your naked eye on a
[1:05:29] very clear night, right? Actually,
[1:05:34] and the mind-blowing thing about this is
[1:05:37] just how big the universe really is.
[1:05:40] Cuz you think where you can't even see
[1:05:42] anything, there's
[1:05:44] just billions of worlds out there. And
[1:05:48] God made all of this. And he made, you
[1:05:51] know, the you learn about, you know, the
[1:05:53] cosmos and stuff. You know, there are
[1:05:54] planets in our solar system where it
[1:05:56] rains diamonds.
[1:05:58] I've been like I always like the rain. I
[1:06:00] think it's really pretty. Like
[1:06:00] especially like the rainbow and you get
[1:06:02] like the sun coming through. It's really
[1:06:03] pretty. Imagine this like a a rainbow
[1:06:05] during a diamond rain shower. I mean,
[1:06:08] make anything you could imagine just not
[1:06:11] even compare. You know, there's there's
[1:06:14] mountains in the solar system that are
[1:06:17] bigger than any mountain on Earth. On
[1:06:19] Mars is a mountain that's makes Everest
[1:06:22] look like a foothill. And you, you know,
[1:06:25] I like the mountains. You these
[1:06:26] beautiful mountain vistas.
[1:06:29] And you, you know, these these are
[1:06:33] absolute
[1:06:34] beautiful
[1:06:37] paces of the cosmos.
[1:06:41] Um,
[1:06:45] and um,
[1:06:49] there's a uh,
[1:06:52] in the middle of all that.
[1:06:55] Go to the next slide.
[1:06:57] There's that guy.
[1:06:59] Anybody see that? See it? This
[1:07:05] that's spec.
[1:07:11] that is Earth.
[1:07:15] And this astronomer had this to say
[1:07:16] about it.
[1:07:20] He was he was talking about this this
[1:07:21] very photograph.
[1:07:23] He says, "Look again at that dot. That's
[1:07:27] here. That's home.
[1:07:31] That's us.
[1:07:33] on it. Everything you love, everyone you
[1:07:37] know, everyone you ever heard of, every
[1:07:40] human being who ever was lived out their
[1:07:42] lives. The aggregate of our joy and
[1:07:46] suffering, thousands of confident
[1:07:48] religions, ideologies, and economic
[1:07:50] doctrines. Every hunter and forager,
[1:07:53] every hero and coward, every creator and
[1:07:57] destroyer of civilization, every king
[1:07:59] and peasant, every young couple in love,
[1:08:02] every mother and father, hopeful child,
[1:08:04] inventor and explorer, every teacher of
[1:08:07] morals, ever every corrupt politician,
[1:08:10] every superstar, every supreme leader,
[1:08:13] every saint and sinner in the history of
[1:08:14] our species lived there on a mode of
[1:08:17] dust suspended in a sunbeam.
[1:08:24] But God so loved that pale blue dot.
[1:08:28] He built all the cosmos.
[1:08:31] All of that.
[1:08:33] The things that you can't even
[1:08:34] comprehend
[1:08:36] to be background for a dust moat.
[1:08:42] All of it was to be so the dust moat can
[1:08:46] look up and say, "Wow, God's good.
[1:08:51] All of it was so that the dust moat
[1:08:53] could be special.
[1:08:58] And God so loved that pale blue dot
[1:09:01] because it would be where his people
[1:09:04] lived.
[1:09:05] There aren't any people on Mars to
[1:09:07] appreciate the mountains and there
[1:09:09] aren't any people on Venus to appreciate
[1:09:11] the diamond rainstorms,
[1:09:13] but there's people on Earth to
[1:09:16] appreciate God.
[1:09:19] And God built, he so loved that little
[1:09:22] speck
[1:09:24] and he wooed over that little speck. And
[1:09:27] he spent thousands of years maybe making
[1:09:30] that little speck.
[1:09:33] And every everywhere he went, he would
[1:09:35] say, "Oh, this this little mountain
[1:09:37] here, oh, this is this is going to be
[1:09:38] this is going to be great. I'm gonna I'm
[1:09:40] gonna build
[1:09:42] I'm gonna build this mountain and then
[1:09:45] I'm gonna I'm gonna meet my my my my my
[1:09:47] servant Abraham here and this is where
[1:09:50] I'm going to I'm going to be with him
[1:09:51] and I'm going to I'm going to give him a
[1:09:53] promise for a great nation, you know,
[1:09:56] and and this this mountain over here.
[1:09:59] Oh, this is where oh the children of
[1:10:00] Abraham, they're going to be they're
[1:10:01] going to I'm going to deliver them. I'm
[1:10:03] gonna deliver them from Egypt and
[1:10:04] they're gonna come between these two
[1:10:05] mountains and they're gonna be trapped
[1:10:06] and then I'm just this giant sea in
[1:10:08] front of them and I'm gonna build this
[1:10:09] sea so I can make it part and they can
[1:10:10] cross it and they're going to be it's
[1:10:11] going to be wonderful. And he's so
[1:10:13] excited as he builds this earth as he
[1:10:15] builds he he's planning out every
[1:10:17] detail, you know, because you know
[1:10:20] that's what you do when you're building
[1:10:21] a house, right? It's you're you're
[1:10:24] thinking, "Oh, I'm going to tear this
[1:10:25] wall down. It's going to make the view
[1:10:26] so good and I'm going to plant a garden
[1:10:27] over there in the yard." And you know,
[1:10:29] you're you're pling you're making these
[1:10:30] dreams, right? God's going to live here
[1:10:32] with his family. He's gonna have this
[1:10:33] this great drama play out in this little
[1:10:36] insignificant nothing.
[1:10:40] And you know, he's he's got, you know,
[1:10:42] Mount Si and he's got Mount Carmel where
[1:10:44] there's going to be a big thing. And you
[1:10:45] know, he's, you know, he's got every
[1:10:48] single thing set up.
[1:10:51] Then the end of all of it, he's got, you
[1:10:53] know, Mount Everest and he's got the,
[1:10:56] you know, the I particularly like the
[1:10:58] Rocky Mountains. You know, if you've
[1:10:59] been in the Hila wilderness, you know,
[1:11:02] he's going to build a big mountain and
[1:11:04] say, "That's where I'm going to give
[1:11:05] Matthew Smith the thought for this
[1:11:06] sermon because that's where I got it in
[1:11:09] the Heila." Um,
[1:11:12] you know, and and this is
[1:11:15] this is where
[1:11:17] God's planning everything out.
[1:11:19] Amen.
[1:11:20] And in the middle of all this, goes down
[1:11:23] in little spot in Israel and he goes
[1:11:28] pushes up some dirt and some rocks
[1:11:32] and makes this really ugly little mound
[1:11:36] and goes and all of that,
[1:11:40] all the beautiful views and the great
[1:11:42] seashores and the beautiful vistas and
[1:11:44] the night sky is all window dressing for
[1:11:48] this little ugly outcrop.
[1:11:51] It's all
[1:11:53] It's all
[1:11:55] setting up the stage
[1:11:57] for the most important little mountain
[1:11:59] on earth. It's all up to here. Cuz on
[1:12:04] this mountain, Moses will save Israel.
[1:12:06] On this mountain, Elijah will save
[1:12:08] Israel. On this mountain, we'll there'll
[1:12:10] be a great victory. On this mountain,
[1:12:12] I'm saving the world.
[1:12:15] This is the most important thing that
[1:12:17] will ever happen.
[1:12:19] And then
[1:12:23] history goes on. Humanity comes along
[1:12:28] and they didn't appreciate the little
[1:12:30] mountain. History tells us they made it
[1:12:33] the dump.
[1:12:35] They made it a trash pile where all of
[1:12:37] Jerusalem would throw their garbage. And
[1:12:41] this is like medieval garbage. It's not
[1:12:42] like modern garbage. This is like really
[1:12:46] nasty stuff.
[1:12:50] And the time came
[1:12:52] Sinai rejoiced when Sinai had its day.
[1:12:56] Mount Carmel rejoiced when Mount Carmel
[1:12:58] had its day. You know, Mount
[1:13:00] Transfiguration rejoiced when Mount
[1:13:01] Transfiguration had its day.
[1:13:04] But then Goltha's day came
[1:13:07] and Golgtha didn't rejoice
[1:13:10] because Golgtha said, "Wait, oh great
[1:13:14] creator, I thought today was a good day.
[1:13:17] We were supposed to save the world. What
[1:13:18] are you doing?
[1:13:20] What's happening? Why Why are they
[1:13:24] taking God
[1:13:26] and killing him?
[1:13:28] This wasn't what I signed up for.
[1:13:32] And I imagine, you know, as they as
[1:13:34] Christ goes up the hill and,
[1:13:38] you know,
[1:13:40] he's there on the cross and the the
[1:13:42] blood's running down and
[1:13:46] there's this event of of of atonement
[1:13:49] that
[1:13:52] you know said the the stones the earth
[1:13:55] shook, that the skies darkened and the
[1:13:58] ground shook. Why? Because the ground is
[1:14:00] crying out, screaming, "What are you
[1:14:02] doing?"
[1:14:04] Have you not recognized that the hands
[1:14:06] that you just drove nails through built
[1:14:08] the ground you're standing on?
[1:14:11] You're you're the breath that he
[1:14:15] breathed breathed life into all of your
[1:14:16] y into your lungs. He created the tree
[1:14:20] you nailed him to.
[1:14:22] You blind fools. And it's crying out
[1:14:26] saying, "What are you doing? This is is
[1:14:30] in agony because it's it's day has come
[1:14:34] and it's it's sitting there in in in
[1:14:37] filth that the world has made it filth."
[1:14:39] And then and then I imagine Satan
[1:14:42] standing there on, you know, some spire
[1:14:45] in hell looking out upon this scene
[1:14:47] saying, "Ah, yes, this is good." you
[1:14:50] know,
[1:14:52] here here we have planted a tree of
[1:14:54] death
[1:14:55] in the midst of my garden,
[1:14:58] you know, and all the sa all of Satan's
[1:15:01] angels rejoice
[1:15:03] because they've won.
[1:15:08] But I imagine the spirit of God coming
[1:15:10] down as the as the mountain is
[1:15:14] crying out broken because it had this
[1:15:16] great promise in its life from before
[1:15:18] the foundation of the world really
[1:15:20] that this was going to be the a great
[1:15:22] thing would happen here. And yet it was
[1:15:24] covered in garbage.
[1:15:26] And the people of Israel said, "Ah yes,
[1:15:28] we'll add some more garbage. this this
[1:15:31] no good false king,
[1:15:34] you know,
[1:15:37] and in spite of how much garbage that
[1:15:41] they piled on that mountain,
[1:15:45] when the blood of Christ ran down the
[1:15:47] cross and anointed that ground, it was
[1:15:50] the holiest place on earth. It didn't
[1:15:54] change the fact that it was a holy
[1:15:55] ground. Just because
[1:15:58] the circumstances of your history
[1:16:01] covered you in garbage
[1:16:04] doesn't change the fact that when you
[1:16:06] are anointed with the blood of God,
[1:16:07] you're the holiest thing on earth.
[1:16:10] I don't care what you've done. I don't
[1:16:13] care how just filthy or bad your skins
[1:16:16] are. God's never going to look at that
[1:16:19] ears. You're the holiest thing on earth
[1:16:21] because the blood of an innocent one has
[1:16:24] made the atonement. The only thing you
[1:16:27] have to do is accept the pardon.
[1:16:30] And it's and it's, you know, it's beyond
[1:16:34] it's beyond, you know, because it says
[1:16:36] the penalty of the sin. You're the
[1:16:39] pardon is is is excludes you from the
[1:16:42] penalty of sin. What's the penalty of
[1:16:44] sin?
[1:16:46] Death, sickness, disease, depression.
[1:16:49] You know, I once heard that um
[1:16:52] you know, really if you if you if you
[1:16:54] notice the first thing that Adam and Eve
[1:16:56] did as soon as they sinned is they
[1:16:57] became self-conscious.
[1:16:58] Yeah.
[1:16:59] They became
[1:17:01] like aware of themselves and their own
[1:17:03] wretchedness.
[1:17:05] And
[1:17:07] I I heard a psychologist talk about
[1:17:09] this. And in fact,
[1:17:11] the circuits in your brain that cause
[1:17:14] you to be self-conscious and and
[1:17:16] conscious enough for yourself, usually
[1:17:18] things like depression and well,
[1:17:20] basically every mental illness that you
[1:17:22] can name um are all defects of the
[1:17:25] circuits in your brain that make you
[1:17:26] self-conscious.
[1:17:29] Yeah.
[1:17:31] And the moment that
[1:17:35] Adam and Eve sin is the moment that
[1:17:37] mental illness happened. Yes.
[1:17:41] Because all of those circuits activate.
[1:17:43] They broke it.
[1:17:45] And I don't care. That's I've preached
[1:17:49] this before. That's all part of your
[1:17:52] flesh, right? You know, we talked about
[1:17:54] you have five spiritual senses and five
[1:17:56] natural senses. One of those spiritual
[1:17:58] senses is memory, right? This is the
[1:18:01] easy example. You have memories, right?
[1:18:03] That's a spiritual sense. That's part of
[1:18:04] your spirit, the invisible spirit you.
[1:18:07] But then you have but you can look on a
[1:18:09] you can look on a brain scan and see the
[1:18:11] memories in your physical body, right?
[1:18:13] You get hit on the head, you might not
[1:18:14] remember a whole lot. You know, people
[1:18:17] get amnesia. Well, what happened? They
[1:18:19] damaged their body and it also damaged
[1:18:21] their spirit because their spirit and
[1:18:22] their flesh, man, you're kind of the
[1:18:24] same thing. So when God made an
[1:18:26] atonement for your healing, he was not
[1:18:29] making an atonement for your cuts and
[1:18:31] bruises. He was making an atonement for
[1:18:33] that depression devil that haunts you.
[1:18:35] He's making an atonement for whatever
[1:18:40] spiritual or physical need you have from
[1:18:43] sin sickness, from addiction, from
[1:18:46] whatever.
[1:18:48] It's all under the blood. You just have
[1:18:50] to recognize that you need it.
[1:18:53] You know, I want to I want to read um
[1:18:57] uh back to that scripture I read in in
[1:18:59] Jeremiah,
[1:19:01] if I can find it. Um, I'm going to I'm
[1:19:06] going to actually call for the musicians
[1:19:08] cuz otherwise I will keep preaching. Um,
[1:19:13] and we got to we got to shut her down.
[1:19:15] Um,
[1:19:23] says,
[1:19:28] I'm going to read this from the from the
[1:19:31] NLT.
[1:19:32] um cuz the King James makes it a little
[1:19:35] bit um unclear. This is that same
[1:19:39] scripture I read in Jeremiah.
[1:19:42] I'll start at verse 9. And it says,
[1:19:44] "Israel treated it all so lightly. She
[1:19:46] thought nothing of committing adultery
[1:19:48] by worshiping idols made of wood and
[1:19:50] stone. So now the land has been
[1:19:52] polluted. But despite all this, her
[1:19:55] faithless sister Judah has never
[1:19:57] sincerely returned to me. She has only
[1:19:59] pretended to be sorry. I the Lord have
[1:20:01] spoken. Verse 11. Then the Lord said
[1:20:05] unto me, even faithless Israel is less
[1:20:08] guilty than treacherous Judah.
[1:20:12] Therefore, go and give this message to
[1:20:14] Israel.
[1:20:18] This is what the Lord says. Oh Israel,
[1:20:20] my faithless people, come home to me
[1:20:23] again, for I am merciful.
[1:20:26] I will not be angry with you forever.
[1:20:29] only acknowledge your guilt.
[1:20:32] Admit that you rebelled against the Lord
[1:20:33] your God and committed adultery against
[1:20:35] him by worshiping idols under every
[1:20:37] green tree. Confess that you refused to
[1:20:39] listen to my voice. I the Lord have
[1:20:42] spoken.
[1:20:44] And so I don't know what any one person
[1:20:47] has done. I know what I do. I know what
[1:20:49] I've done.
[1:20:52] And I know that,
[1:20:59] you know, a lot of times we have maybe
[1:21:01] it's maybe it's some physical need that
[1:21:03] you have. I don't know. I
[1:21:08] whatever it is that you've got,
[1:21:12] there's an atonement
[1:21:15] that the price for sin has been
[1:21:17] forgiven.
[1:21:18] And maybe you're you're sitting there
[1:21:20] going, "But
[1:21:23] I'm tired of being this way. I'm tired
[1:21:26] of being
[1:21:28] feeling like I need to go kill that lamb
[1:21:30] every, you know, not, you know, you're
[1:21:32] always going to have your flesh, but did
[1:21:34] you want that clean heart like David
[1:21:36] had?"
[1:21:38] You know, there was that petition
[1:21:42] between the soul and the spirit when
[1:21:46] they built that tabernacle.
[1:21:48] But on the day of Calvary, that
[1:21:51] partition was torn in half.
[1:21:53] God did that because there was no longer
[1:21:56] a flaming sword blocking you. There was
[1:21:59] now that tree of life that lives in your
[1:22:01] soul. There's no more partition. That
[1:22:04] Holy Spirit that is in the soul can now
[1:22:07] come in and fill your spirit.
[1:22:09] There's no there's nothing stopping your
[1:22:11] spirit from communing directly with that
[1:22:13] holiest of holies
[1:22:15] because there's been an atonement that
[1:22:18] you could have the the literal life of
[1:22:20] Christ living through your heart, living
[1:22:22] through you.
[1:22:24] And so maybe that's what you're looking
[1:22:26] for tonight. I don't know.
[1:22:29] Maybe maybe you're just really
[1:22:34] tired.
[1:22:36] Maybe you're just very discouraged and
[1:22:38] all you can see is a wretched stinking
[1:22:42] badger carcass.
[1:22:48] what I all I've got if I could if I
[1:22:50] could leave you with this
[1:22:54] is to say
[1:22:58] there is no matter how no matter what
[1:23:02] situation you've got there's an
[1:23:04] atonement and there's a covenant and all
[1:23:07] God sees is that is that ram skin and
[1:23:10] that
[1:23:12] you're no longer required to be chained
[1:23:14] to that thing because the price of sin
[1:23:18] has been paid,
[1:23:20] right? You're no longer subject. There
[1:23:22] is a there is an atonement. There is a
[1:23:25] there's a pardon been given. All you
[1:23:27] have to do is recognize that you need
[1:23:29] it. God never sent a sinner to hell. He
[1:23:31] only sent someone to who remained a
[1:23:33] sinner when they didn't have to be. And
[1:23:35] you ain't got to be a sinner no more.
[1:23:37] You ain't got to be sick no more because
[1:23:40] you're no longer subject to that.
[1:23:43] And so
[1:23:45] I guess as heard brother Brandham say
[1:23:48] today when he finished his sermon, I
[1:23:50] feel free now.
[1:23:53] I
[1:23:54] I guess I feel free. What What you
[1:23:57] singing?
[1:24:01] Grace.
[1:24:03] Grace.
[1:24:06] God's
[1:24:10] grace.
[1:24:11] [Music]
[1:24:13] Grace for it,
[1:24:16] Lorden
[1:24:18] and
[1:24:25] grace.
[1:24:28] Grace,
[1:24:31] God's
[1:24:34] grace,
[1:24:37] grace that
[1:24:39] is greater
[1:24:41] than all
[1:24:45] our sin.
[1:24:47] [Music]
[1:24:49] Praise.
[1:24:51] Praise
[1:24:54] God.
[1:25:00] Praise that
[1:25:03] will part
[1:25:09] with thee.
[1:25:13] Praise.
[1:25:16] Praise
[1:25:18] God.
[1:25:20] God's grace,
[1:25:24] grace that
[1:25:27] is greater
[1:25:29] than all
[1:25:33] our sins.
[1:25:39] Before I turn to the prayer service, I
[1:25:43] wanted to
[1:25:45] Lord just told me to read this last last
[1:25:48] portion. Right. I want to be sensitive
[1:25:50] to that.
[1:25:53] Um
[1:25:55] [Music]
[1:25:57] that song down from his glory.
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:03] There was um
[1:26:07] brother Brandham mentions that song
[1:26:09] several times. He said it was one of his
[1:26:11] top three songs. mentions it with
[1:26:13] several other things, but
[1:26:17] he's talking about that and he's going
[1:26:19] on and talking about, you know, the
[1:26:21] Christ and how anyone who ever, you
[1:26:24] know, any Christian has to come to the
[1:26:25] foot of that cross and and whatnot.
[1:26:29] And so he says this, he says, "Every man
[1:26:32] that's ever mounted to a hill of beans
[1:26:34] in his life has been a man who trusted
[1:26:36] him.
[1:26:38] And he was the son of the living God,
[1:26:40] the incarnated Jehovah here on earth.
[1:26:42] Yes, sir. No wonder.
[1:26:45] Do we have the lyrics to down from his
[1:26:46] glory? Brother Josh, put up the first
[1:26:49] verse quick.
[1:26:52] So he says, you know, he's talking
[1:26:53] about, you know, every man that's come
[1:26:55] to the hill, you know, mounted anything
[1:26:58] come to the for that cross there. And he
[1:27:00] says, and then he then he he stops. He
[1:27:02] says and he starts quoting these lyrics
[1:27:04] says down from his glory ever living the
[1:27:06] story.
[1:27:08] My Lord and Savior came and Jesus was
[1:27:11] his name. He was born in a manger
[1:27:15] because God always picks the unlikely
[1:27:17] ugly places
[1:27:19] to his own a stranger.
[1:27:24] The God of sorrows, tears, and agony.
[1:27:28] Now I know the lyrics of that song.
[1:27:30] That's not how the words go.
[1:27:32] doesn't say the God of sorrows, tears,
[1:27:34] and agony. Brother Brandham said he was
[1:27:37] the God of sorrows, tears, and agony.
[1:27:42] He's not just God when things are going
[1:27:44] really good and you're doing really well
[1:27:46] and you're feeling on top of the world
[1:27:47] and you you felt like you had a good day
[1:27:49] and that everything went well and you
[1:27:51] didn't make a train wreck out of things.
[1:27:53] He's the God of sorrows, tears, and
[1:27:56] agony, too.
[1:27:58] He's the God when things are really,
[1:28:00] really bad. When the wheels are falling
[1:28:03] off and you don't know how to fix it.
[1:28:05] He's the God when you're at the end of
[1:28:06] the rope and the only thing at the end
[1:28:08] of the rope is a noose.
[1:28:11] And I've been there, folks. And I know
[1:28:13] he's God there, too.
[1:28:17] And I don't know what what's at the end
[1:28:18] of your rope. And you might be there,
[1:28:20] but friend, God's there, too.
[1:28:24] You just reach out and touch him and
[1:28:25] he'll find you. Amen.
[1:28:27] You never can find God. No man ever
[1:28:30] found God on his own. Only when God
[1:28:32] calls you. And friend, if you're
[1:28:33] reaching for God, it's only because
[1:28:34] God's reaching for you first.
[1:28:37] I never found God. God found me.
[1:28:44] You'll never find God, but God will find
[1:28:46] you.
[1:28:47] You just open your heart and say, "Lord,
[1:28:49] I need you right now."
[1:28:52] Lord,
[1:28:53] it's that amazing grace. It's amazing
[1:28:56] cuz it don't make no sense.
[1:28:58] It's amazing cuz you didn't think that
[1:29:00] it was for you.
[1:29:03] I want to Oh, I'm I'm going to have to
[1:29:05] keep going. I can't stop now.
[1:29:09] Um there's a story with brother Brandham
[1:29:11] Tales of an old man who was walking down
[1:29:15] the side of the road and um
[1:29:19] a young couple who was you know carrying
[1:29:22] on probably drunk driver and whatever
[1:29:24] hit him and he's just a pedestrian and
[1:29:26] they they just ran him over
[1:29:31] and um
[1:29:36] he's in the hospital. He's all mashed
[1:29:37] up. I mean, just broke like every bone
[1:29:39] in his body. And he's just, you know,
[1:29:42] they he's sitting in the ER and the and
[1:29:44] the doctors
[1:29:46] the doctors are looking at him going,
[1:29:49] "Oh, they I mean, he's they thought he
[1:29:51] was in a coma, right? And he's just just
[1:29:54] not moving, just kind of sitting there
[1:29:55] unconscious and they're going and the
[1:29:56] doctors are all standing around going,
[1:29:58] "Ah, man. What do we do with this guy?"
[1:30:00] I mean, he's pretty much unsavable at
[1:30:02] this point. And he's just a bum. He just
[1:30:04] goes around talking to people. He's not
[1:30:06] anything. He ain't got no money. We
[1:30:08] could put a bunch of time in trying to
[1:30:09] fix him, but he can't pay for nothing.
[1:30:11] And there's a bunch of people out in
[1:30:12] that emergency room. We could spend
[1:30:13] hours trying to fix this guy and he's
[1:30:14] still going to die. We We should, you
[1:30:17] know, we should He's not really worth
[1:30:18] nothing. Let's go spend our time on
[1:30:20] these other people who are worth
[1:30:22] something.
[1:30:25] And so, Brother Brandon picks up the
[1:30:26] story there and he says, "And the old
[1:30:28] fellow doesn't have very much longer to
[1:30:30] live and we got others waiting out here.
[1:30:33] I just don't believe it's worthwhile to
[1:30:34] do it. Let's just lay him back and it
[1:30:36] won't be too long till he'll be gone
[1:30:38] anyhow.
[1:30:40] But the old man wasn't as dead as they
[1:30:42] thought he was. He turned himself over,
[1:30:45] said, "Gentlemen, I've heard every word
[1:30:47] you said." He said, "I'm worth
[1:30:50] something." He said, "I'm worth so much
[1:30:52] till God gave his only begotten son that
[1:30:54] I would be saved." And he said, "I
[1:30:56] received that message some 50 years ago,
[1:30:58] and as passing tracks on the street, I
[1:31:00] walk from place to place trying to
[1:31:02] preach the gospel." He said, 'I'm worth
[1:31:04] something or God would have never saved
[1:31:06] me.
[1:31:08] Sure, huh? Is Brother Brandham, "Sure
[1:31:10] you are. Angels of God are here. I don't
[1:31:14] care what you've done. Though your sins
[1:31:16] be as scarlet, they'll be white like
[1:31:18] wool. Though they be red like crimson,
[1:31:20] they shall be white like snow."
[1:31:22] Amen.
[1:31:23] Let's hold a conference, each one where
[1:31:26] you're at.
[1:31:27] Yes.
[1:31:28] And ask God, "Oh Lord, am I worth
[1:31:30] anything? I'm just a housewife. I'm just
[1:31:33] a farmer. I work at a filling station. I
[1:31:37] don't care what you do. But you see,
[1:31:40] Lord, I've been evil. I've made three or
[1:31:44] four shows and fell. I don't care what
[1:31:46] you've done. Let's hold a conference.
[1:31:49] Though your trials has failed, though
[1:31:51] your intellectuals has passed away,
[1:31:53] God's got a burning bush right by every
[1:31:55] seat here tonight. He's got an angel
[1:31:58] that can set your heart on fire. Come,
[1:32:00] let us reason together. Let's start here
[1:32:03] from 11th Street in Garfield. Let's
[1:32:05] start right here in Bethl Tabernacle.
[1:32:09] Let's start, you Christians. Let's let
[1:32:11] us hold us a conference. Let's hold a
[1:32:13] conference.
[1:32:15] Lord, my life will soon be over. Jesus
[1:32:19] will soon come. And friend, I don't know
[1:32:21] how many times you might have started. I
[1:32:23] don't care how maybe you've been a on
[1:32:25] the outside had your really nice fig
[1:32:27] leaves and look like a good Christian
[1:32:28] for 35 years. I don't know. And maybe
[1:32:31] you just need a conference with God. But
[1:32:34] there's an angel by every seat ready to
[1:32:36] take your request to God right now.
[1:32:43] Doesn't matter what you look like. It's
[1:32:46] never mattered. It's not about you. It's
[1:32:49] about God.
[1:32:51] Amen.
[1:32:52] All right. Now I'm free.
[1:32:56] Let's uh
[1:32:58] let's um
[1:33:03] [Applause]
[1:33:12] there's anyone here who wants prayer.
[1:33:16] You don't necessarily have to come
[1:33:17] forward. If you got the faith in your
[1:33:19] heart to accept the message where you're
[1:33:20] sitting, you can have it. It's for you.
[1:33:24] But if it would help your faith,
[1:33:27] whatever would whatever need you would
[1:33:28] have need of. If you want to come
[1:33:30] forward and have prayer, God will meet
[1:33:32] you here.
[1:33:34] I've seen it too many times. I've been
[1:33:37] there. I know God will meet you if
[1:33:39] you're looking for him because he's
[1:33:41] looking for you already.
[1:33:46] So you you think about it. We'll sing
[1:33:49] the song.
[1:33:51] And if you want to accept the message
[1:33:52] right where you're standing, you do it.
[1:33:54] If you want prayer,
[1:33:56] I'll pray with you till you come
[1:33:59] through.

[1:34:11] grace.

[1:36:14] grace,
[1:36:17] grace that
[1:36:19] is greater
[1:36:22] than all
[1:36:25] my sins.
[1:36:28] Well, he
[1:36:31] became me
[1:36:35] so that I might
[1:36:38] become him
[1:36:41] by grace.
[1:36:43] [Music]
[1:36:47] Oh, he
[1:36:49] became me.
[1:36:53] So am I. Thank you, Lord. We come here
[1:36:58] by grace.
[1:37:02] Let's raise our hands now and sing it.
[1:37:05] Well, he
[1:37:07] took my place
[1:37:11] so that I
[1:37:13] through his love could take it.
[1:37:20] Oh,
[1:37:23] he
[1:37:24] became.
[1:37:26] Yes, Lord.
[1:37:29] Yes, Lord.
[1:37:32] become
[1:37:34] thy grace.
[1:37:40] Amazing
[1:37:41] [Music]

[1:45:36] the Lord
[1:45:39] and find
[1:45:41] there is none. Come on, let's gather.
[1:45:45] I'm going to read these requests as you
[1:45:46] come. Just keep playing that for me.
[1:45:48] Let's gather to the front. Brother Brad
[1:45:50] Y writes in. Just play that softly if
[1:45:52] you could for me.
[1:45:55] Brother Brad Y writes, um, "Please pray
[1:45:58] for Brother Darren and Sister Rebecca
[1:46:00] Kinszer. They've been in a custody
[1:46:01] battle for two and a half years over a
[1:46:03] little girl that they started fostering
[1:46:05] when she was three. The father lives in
[1:46:07] Louisiana. Sister Rebecca uh has been
[1:46:10] having to fly back and forth between
[1:46:12] Virginia and Louisiana for several
[1:46:14] months.
[1:46:15] This is brother Darren Kzer. See pastor
[1:46:18] brother brother Brad. That's what I
[1:46:19] thought. Knew I'd heard that name. The
[1:46:22] father's rights uh were terminated last
[1:46:24] March, but he appealed and the state
[1:46:26] stepped in waiting wanting him to have
[1:46:28] custody. This has been extremely hard on
[1:46:30] the family uh the family's mentality and
[1:46:33] phys physically and mentally. The court
[1:46:35] date is tomorrow. They will know in two
[1:46:37] days who gets custody. We want to
[1:46:39] remember our brother Darren, sister
[1:46:40] Rebecca Kendzer. Sister Wanda writes,
[1:46:43] "I've been fighting a sickness again,
[1:46:45] headache and a sore throat." We want to
[1:46:47] remember our sister Wanda. Uh brother
[1:46:50] Tony also is here, but Sister Amber's
[1:46:52] not. She's at home. Her back went out.
[1:46:53] She's in a lot of back pain. And so we
[1:46:56] want to just remember her. Amen. Tonight
[1:46:58] I don't see any other needs. Maybe you
[1:47:00] have something upon your heart. Do you
[1:47:03] appreciate the message tonight?
[1:47:04] And you just love that. Aren't you glad
[1:47:06] for a part?
[1:47:10] My goodness. I think that was just a
[1:47:12] masterpiece. Brother Matthew thought of
[1:47:14] brother Brandon told that story so much
[1:47:16] of u I think the Arthur McCoy I think
[1:47:20] that's is the man's name brother Brandon
[1:47:22] gives.
[1:47:24] And he tells that story about the
[1:47:25] brother about Arthur coming before the
[1:47:27] great white throne or not or the gate.
[1:47:29] And he said he had a dream. He came
[1:47:30] before the gate. And he said he they
[1:47:34] wouldn't let him in. And he said, "Well,
[1:47:35] I'm I'm Arthur McCoy. I was a I was an
[1:47:38] evangelist. I was a preacher." And he
[1:47:41] said, "Well, we're looking here on the
[1:47:42] book and you know, we don't see we don't
[1:47:45] see your name." He said, "Well, there
[1:47:46] must be some kind of mistake. I'm a
[1:47:48] preacher. I was a evangelist." He said,
[1:47:49] "Well, Arthur McCoy, we don't we don't
[1:47:52] we don't we don't have your name here."
[1:47:54] And he says, "Well, what can I do?" And
[1:47:57] he says, "Well, you can appeal your
[1:47:58] case." And he says, "You mean before the
[1:48:00] white throne judgment?" And he said,
[1:48:02] "Yes, sir. That's right." He says, "Oh,
[1:48:04] Lord, I don't want to go there, but if
[1:48:05] that's my only hope." And brother
[1:48:07] Brandham said he goes through that
[1:48:08] dream. He starts gets dark and then it
[1:48:10] gets light. And he said, "And all of a
[1:48:12] sudden, there he is." And he said he
[1:48:14] stood there and brother Brandham said
[1:48:17] the voice rang out and said, "Who stands
[1:48:19] before my my throne?" And Arthur stood
[1:48:22] up spoke up and said, "Arthur McCoy."
[1:48:24] And he said, "Arthur McCoy?" He said,
[1:48:26] "Are you here because your name wasn't
[1:48:28] found in the book?" He said, "Yes, sir.
[1:48:30] That's right." He said, "But I was a I
[1:48:32] was a preacher." And he says, "Well, are
[1:48:34] you here to appeal your case?" He said,
[1:48:36] "Yes, sir. I'm here to appeal my case."
[1:48:39] And he said, 'Well, then you'll be
[1:48:41] judged according to my law.'
[1:48:44] Arthur Mcola, have you ever told a lie?
[1:48:49] Brother Brandham said, Arthur says,
[1:48:50] "Well, you know, I thought I'd been a
[1:48:52] good, honest guy." And he says, "But in
[1:48:54] the presence of that light,
[1:48:56] I was a sinner."
[1:48:58] Brother Brandham says, "And all of us in
[1:49:00] that light are sinners."
[1:49:02] Lose all pride, all dignity. We're all
[1:49:04] the same.
[1:49:06] Brother Brandham says in that great
[1:49:07] light, he says, 'You know, have you ever
[1:49:09] told a lie? And Brother Arthur says,
[1:49:11] 'Well, he says, you know, he said, there
[1:49:12] was those little white lies I told. And
[1:49:14] he said, but you know, in the presence
[1:49:16] of that lie, he said, those little lies
[1:49:18] were big lies.
[1:49:20] And and brother Brandham says, "That's
[1:49:22] real conviction." He think you're
[1:49:24] convicted when the preaching of the word
[1:49:25] comes. Brother Brandham says, "You wait
[1:49:27] till you get under that that light and
[1:49:28] that white throne judgment. Did you ever
[1:49:30] steal, Arthur McCoy?" And he says, "You
[1:49:33] know, I thought I'd been pretty
[1:49:34] straight." He says, "But then I realized
[1:49:36] there were some Dillings maybe I did
[1:49:38] that weren't exactly honest." He said,
[1:49:39] "Yes, sir." He said, "I've stolen." He
[1:49:42] said, "You've lied. You've stolen." And
[1:49:44] he said, "The voice said, "Then depart
[1:49:46] from me." And to and he said he was
[1:49:48] going to say into everlasting flames. He
[1:49:50] said, "And at that moment," he said, "I
[1:49:52] heard a voice, the sweetest voice I've
[1:49:55] ever heard." And he said, "I turned and
[1:49:57] looked and seen the sweetest face I've
[1:49:59] ever seen, sweeter than a mother's face,
[1:50:02] and it was the Lord Jesus." And he said,
[1:50:05] "Father, it's true. He's told a lie.
[1:50:08] He's lied. He's stolen.
[1:50:11] But on earth, he stood for me." And he
[1:50:14] said, "So now I want to take his place
[1:50:16] and stand for him." And brother Man
[1:50:19] says, "Oh, don't you want to say that
[1:50:20] today? Take my place, Lord. In the
[1:50:23] presence of that light, that kind of
[1:50:24] preaching, Lord, I realize I'm guilty,
[1:50:26] God, but let let the lamb give me my
[1:50:30] pardon and take my place."
[1:50:33] Amen. Appreciate that word.
[1:50:36] Praise the Lord. Maybe you have an
[1:50:38] unspoken request, something you didn't
[1:50:40] get a chance to write down. You just
[1:50:41] wanted Brother Luther. There's another
[1:50:42] one.
[1:50:45] Oh, she sent it to me. I'm sorry. Let me
[1:50:48] see here.
[1:50:51] Prayer for myself for normal blood
[1:50:53] pressure. That's from Sister Elizabeth
[1:50:55] Johnson. We want to remember. Amen. Our
[1:50:58] sister. Why don't you put your hand over
[1:51:00] on that one beside you, brother Matthew?
[1:51:02] come and lead us for these needs. Here
[1:51:04] we got the notes.
[1:51:05] Yeah, it's going to die here in a
[1:51:07] second. Text.
[1:51:10] Yes, sir.
[1:51:17] And
[1:51:18] he killed someone. You said
[1:51:20] a brother down in Florida. Yeah.
[1:51:23] Had been in a car accident.
[1:51:24] Yeah.
[1:51:26] And he been in a car accident.
[1:51:28] Yeah. and they had a trial and he's
[1:51:32] didn't have a driver's license. So, they
[1:51:34] thinking about deporting him.
[1:51:37] One of the brothers, you know, going
[1:51:39] back to work, different things.
[1:51:56] Okay,
[1:51:57] you got that. All right, let's pray.
[1:52:00] Okay, let's all um
[1:52:05] let's bow our hearts for the throne.
[1:52:08] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:52:09] Oh, great father, oh great King,
[1:52:14] great God, and holy Lord,
[1:52:18] we're coming before your throne, Father,
[1:52:21] with our hearts in our hands, Lord, to
[1:52:25] throw ourselves upon your mercy. Yes,
[1:52:27] that pardon was an act of grace.
[1:52:31] Lord, we're coming on behalf of
[1:52:34] our friends and our family and the body
[1:52:37] of Christ.
[1:52:41] Lord, we have this
[1:52:44] this family, this this Kinszer family
[1:52:49] torn apart by
[1:52:51] a court system.
[1:52:55] this little girl.
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:52:58] Lord, you know that it's your in your
[1:53:01] word that she should be raised in a
[1:53:03] godly home.
[1:53:07] So Lord, we're asking that this
[1:53:08] situation that you would be with them,
[1:53:12] you'd be with this little girl,
[1:53:14] that you'd be with this family,
[1:53:16] that you would be with the Kensers.
[1:53:20] For Father, we know you make ways where
[1:53:22] there are no ways. Lord Jesus,
[1:53:25] you are the way maker.
[1:53:27] You are the everpresent help
[1:53:30] in all times of trouble,
[1:53:33] whatever it may be.
[1:53:35] You are the returner of children.
[1:53:39] So, Father, we're asking that you would
[1:53:41] be with this situation. Lord,
[1:53:46] for our sister Wanda,
[1:53:49] with this headache and sore throat,
[1:53:52] Lord, your Bible says, "By your stripes,
[1:53:54] we were healed." Actually, it says we
[1:53:57] are healed.
[1:53:59] We are healed right now.
[1:54:02] We were healed when that lamb was slain
[1:54:05] before the foundation of the world.
[1:54:08] and Father, that this lying vanity, it's
[1:54:12] a lie because it says that we're not
[1:54:13] healed. It's a contradiction to the word
[1:54:16] of God that says that we are. And so,
[1:54:19] Lord, we're bringing this case before
[1:54:20] your throne and we're asking for an
[1:54:23] enforcement upon this that your law
[1:54:26] could be enforced for you gave the
[1:54:28] promise of enforcement
[1:54:31] that your angels would come down and
[1:54:32] enforce this this healing in our
[1:54:35] sister's life, Lord.
[1:54:38] for our sister Amber.
[1:54:42] Here she is
[1:54:44] with her with her back out.
[1:54:46] A lot of pain.
[1:54:49] Lord,
[1:54:51] those stripes on your back.
[1:54:53] Yes,
[1:54:54] you felt that pain on your back
[1:54:57] and
[1:54:58] you know.
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:00] So, father for the you can enter into
[1:55:03] the suff the feeling of that infirmity
[1:55:05] and we can enter into the feeling of
[1:55:07] that infirmity and I've been there and I
[1:55:10] can I can speak on my sister's behalf
[1:55:12] and say that Lord if you granted me
[1:55:14] healing you must grant my sister healing
[1:55:16] too so our sister sister Amber can lay
[1:55:20] claim to her healing
[1:55:23] and father this situation for our our
[1:55:26] our uh
[1:55:29] sister Johnson. Lord, I I I don't have
[1:55:33] it before me, Lord, but Lord, you know
[1:55:35] the situation
[1:55:37] for her blood pressure.
[1:55:41] Lord, you are the fixer of hearts. You
[1:55:44] can heal the broken heart. Whatever
[1:55:46] would be the impediment, Lord, that it
[1:55:48] would it would resolve itself. We we we
[1:55:51] don't need to accept this.
[1:55:53] You give healing. You touch the
[1:55:56] brokenhearted.
[1:55:58] And so we're asking, Father, that you
[1:55:59] would come down and send your send your
[1:56:01] angel down, Father, and and and evict
[1:56:05] this devil that would that would attack
[1:56:08] our sister.
[1:56:10] Oh, Father, for
[1:56:13] this this situation with this man, Lord,
[1:56:17] one of your children
[1:56:19] in in a bad situation
[1:56:23] who made a mistake,
[1:56:26] someone's someone's
[1:56:28] been killed because of it.
[1:56:32] So Lord,
[1:56:34] the authorities would be moving in to
[1:56:37] maybe send him away and
[1:56:41] the hardship for his family and
[1:56:44] the there would be accusations going
[1:56:46] this way and that way. But Lord, you
[1:56:48] know the heart.
[1:56:50] You know what would be best for him. You
[1:56:53] know the situation.
[1:56:55] And Lord, we ask that you would be with
[1:56:57] him in the everpresent help in this time
[1:57:00] of trouble.
[1:57:02] That you would be there when there would
[1:57:04] seem to be no way.
[1:57:07] when there would be nothing but
[1:57:09] darkness.
[1:57:10] Lord, I was hearing your prophet just
[1:57:12] today
[1:57:14] speaking about how people at their
[1:57:16] darkest hour in their darkest moment
[1:57:22] that when Georgie Carter was in her
[1:57:23] darkest moment that she had prayed and
[1:57:25] was but 30 something pounds skin and
[1:57:28] bones had been praying for eight years
[1:57:31] and in her darkest moment.
[1:57:33] Yes. and at the end of her rope. And
[1:57:36] then Jesus came.
[1:57:40] How Lazarus had gotten sick.
[1:57:44] How was their darkest hour? How his
[1:57:46] sisters, they had no family. That he was
[1:57:48] going to school to become something. And
[1:57:50] that the sisters only had maybe to sell
[1:57:53] some needle work to get by. And then
[1:57:55] Lazarus got sick.
[1:57:58] And they called for Jesus. So they said,
[1:58:00] "Jesus, come down and heal our heal our
[1:58:02] brother.
[1:58:04] Heal him. You know, we know you can do
[1:58:05] it. You've healed the sick so many
[1:58:07] times."
[1:58:10] But Jesus didn't come
[1:58:14] and Lazarus died.
[1:58:16] And they'd been excommunicated from
[1:58:18] their church. There was no safety net
[1:58:20] for them. No social safety net for them.
[1:58:23] The church threw them out. And there
[1:58:26] they were sitting in their living room
[1:58:27] mourning their dead brother and all
[1:58:30] their former church members laughing at
[1:58:33] him and saying, "Where's your God now?"
[1:58:38] And then Jesus came and though it was
[1:58:41] their darkest hour, then Jesus came.
[1:58:44] Hallelujah.
[1:58:45] So, Father, this situation in our
[1:58:49] darkest hours,
[1:58:50] oh Father, we know you always come.
[1:58:54] And though these this brother may be in
[1:58:57] his darkest hour, Lord,
[1:58:59] we're asking that you would come.
[1:59:02] Oh, Father, be with us. Be with the
[1:59:06] people, Lord, as they would go about
[1:59:08] their days. That they would walk in your
[1:59:11] presence.
[1:59:12] That they would have an open heart to
[1:59:14] you. That should when they would they
[1:59:18] would have a longing for you, Lord. that
[1:59:20] you would live with them, to dwell with
[1:59:22] them, that whatever would whatever would
[1:59:26] come against them, Father, that they
[1:59:28] would have the faith to know that you
[1:59:30] are with them
[1:59:31] and that you will you will bring them
[1:59:33] through it, Lord.
[1:59:35] They would be encouraged and not be
[1:59:37] discouraged by whatever they may see.
[1:59:40] Oh, Father, be with us all.
[1:59:43] We ask these things in your holy and
[1:59:46] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

[2:00:04] going once.
