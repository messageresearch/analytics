TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign God bless you good to be back and see everybody's faces let's stand gracious Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and we thank you for your word we thank you for your light we ask the Lord that you'd take your take each one of your people here Lord and move in our hearts Lord speak to us we want to commit ourselves to you Lord and and we want you to be glorified in our midst take your word Lord and anoint it to our hearts we ask in Jesus name amen all right we're gonna start a new series on our future home and if you want to bring that PowerPoint up brother Mark we're going to look at revelation 21 verse 5. and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and then we'll look ahead to revelation 22 verse 3 and just read the first portion of that and there shall be no more curse amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so here we look at this and we see this is God God bringing things back to his original purpose his original intention so when when God created everything in the beginning he he made he made an earth he made a universe he made everything so that man could live on this Earth that's that's amazing but even better than that we understand we look at Genesis 3 8 and we see and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day so this was what God did so God was walking with man upon the Earth there was no separation there was there was no sin there was no evil everything was in perfect order and when God saw all of all of it the completion of creation he said behold is very good and so we can see then then when we read in the Book of Revelation he says behold I make All Things New and will as as we look at this study we'll understand what he's what God is showing us and telling us is he is going to renew everything he's going to restore everything he's going to bring it back to its original intention and purpose and so we know when we look at at Genesis 1 26 and 27 and 28 the creation of of man and woman his purpose was for them to take Dominion and to fill up the Earth right so they know they never did that in its original condition the Earth is filled up now but it's under a curse it's under a perversion and so God's purpose is to lift the curse God wants to walk with man and uh not having the PowerPoint has my brain all discombobulated right now but as I'm looking at this and I'm seeing this you think about when God when God put together his Nation when he brought Israel into the promised land when he was leading Israel what did God what did God do how did he lead them so he his purpose was not for them to have a human King even a human government see he set forward a priesthood but also remember bigger than that is he said to them I want to make you a nation a kingdom of priests so so when we came to that great confrontation where the people asked for a king they said we want a king like to go out in and out before us like all the other nations and in God's sight this was a great rejection this was a great uh this was horrible this was a great negative because what were they doing they weren't rejecting Samuel they were rejecting God the leadership of God himself I learned this recently and it it really struck me because in um in Egypt when they would go to war Pharaoh would go out with them and what they had for Pharaoh was actually a tent he lit he would live in a tent there would be an outer Court there would be an inner court and then there would be a holy of holies and Pharaoh would sit on a throne with angels Wings above him saying this is the god of Egypt right well here we have God and of course there there they built that I guess after the pattern you see brother Brandon even says Nebuchadnezzar Bill built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon after the pattern of Heaven even the even the pagans every once in a while can hit on what some something that's real that can type out what God is actually doing even though it's in a perverted fashion in a perverted understanding so here we have the Egyptians with their god king leading the armies of Egypt in in his holy of holies well God's purpose was not to have that filled by some man some sinner God's purpose was to be that Supernatural fire to to be the king to lead his people and so when it came to Samuel and they said we want a king what was it they rejected they were rejecting and turning away from God and God said okay I'll give that to you and he raised up David and I began to think about this how does this fit in with the fact that there is a messiah there's an anointed one a man Anointed with God our Lord Jesus Christ who is Seated on the throne and that as I begin to think about this and look forward in this is that in the Millennium that's where the davidic promise is really fulfilled where the temple is restored and where the true son of David rules and reigns forever but we know that forever is not Eternal forever is a space of time it's a long space of time he'll Rule and Reign for a thousand years but remember in First Corinthians 15 it says the son actually submits the kingdom over to the father so that God can be all in all I believe this is showing that the original purpose of God is be will be accomplished and that is that God himself will live among us will dwell Among Us the Bible says in um Revelation 21 verse 1 through 4 I'm going to read that and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God I'll just stop there Jesus said blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God that's the ultimate promise for us is for us to see God we see him now by spiritual revelation but on the new Heaven and the new Earth that will be where the Bible says God will be all in all God's purpose for Israel was for them all to be a kingdom of priests right it was for him he himself to lead them not through not not through a king but he himself would be in them and redeem and and they'd be totally led by him he would raise up someone to lead for this he would raise up someone to lead for this he would raise up someone to lead for this it's the same way he wants to lead his church he has the Seven Stars he raises them up he raises them up in each age for a purpose but there we don't have we don't have a king other than the Lord Jesus Christ that's our only King we don't have an Earthly Pope we don't have an Earthly uh uh supreme leader the supreme leader of the church is not the Ayatollah Khomeini it's the Holy Spirit and so this is God's purpose and Heaven as we speak about it is going to be here on Earth and God is going to bring it all around back to his original purpose that the Tabernacle of God would be with men many times when we think about heaven we get it mixed around the Tabernacle of man is with God that's what we think we're going to go up to heaven and be with god well there's a certain extent that that's true now when when we die now but that's not God's ultimate purpose God's ultimate purpose is that his Dwelling Place will be here on Earth now you can't dwell on Earth why because of sin because of evil but when Redemption is completed in that new Heaven and that new Earth then he can come and dwell in that place so God portrays heaven to us as a garden a city and a kingdom he doesn't portray it to us as outer space as a cloud as some clean room where you go and it's just white and foggy and smoky sure there's pictures of that but that's a picture of the Tabernacle of the dwelling place of God it speaks of the smoke and so forth but that's even a dispensational view that's not what it's always like right so if God's picture of heaven or a better way to say it is our Eternal state is a garden a city and a kingdom we have to see this in the correct light I think all of us can be impacted by cultural pictures by what we hear about heaven and then we get a picture in our mind and it's this other Earthly place if we really want to understand what heaven is like don't think about someplace off in outer space or up on a cloud or some Smoky foggy room no that's not what it is think of this Earth without sin without evil without sickness think of this Earth restored to its original condition if it's a again Abraham was sent to look for a city and for a kingdom whose Builder and maker was God where was he sent was he sent in a spaceship no he went he was on Earth looking for a city which in in itself is a type of us as pilgrims and strangers Abraham never found a city why why didn't he find a city because it wasn't for that age for that time God was using Abraham to show us something Abraham will find a city he's going to reach that City he's going to have that promise but he didn't receive it in this life but the point being is he what he didn't take a spaceship to try to find the city he didn't go to the moon or Jupiter or something he was looking here on Earth God made us in the beginning with physical bodies on a physical planet in a physical unit Universe he made Rivers he made Lakes he made Seas he made streams mountains grasslands forests Etc he didn't make us to walk on the clouds he made us to walk on earth heaven when we think about heaven please let's stop thinking about someplace off in the clouds that's what that's all the cultural pictures and you read the cartoons and somehow that impacts on our minds and we start to think of it that way even the current heaven isn't like that you know you we'll we'll look specifically as we go on but brother Branham in his visions and his of of Heaven never never saw a cloud that's not what he saw he saw palaces he saw Earthly things just think of the first time maybe you saw the Rocky Mountains or you saw a sunrise at the ocean there's probably like a gasp of awestruck wonder that you had I think heaven will be the same experience those those times and you can all remember it maybe you're you're with your family and you're out camping and you see the beauty of God's creation and just the presence that God washes over you and you feel like I could just this could this should be for all of eternity that's what that's a foretaste of that if you're a Believer that's a foretaste of what heaven will be like only it won't end it won't come to it won't come come to an end it will continue another thing that we hear many times when we speak about heaven is that while we can't know what heaven is going to be like and it's a scripture that we all are familiar with but it's always an unfinished scripture because it's it's quoted just one part of it and the rest of it is left out say we can't know what God has in store for us but it's going to be great okay except for that's not what the verse is saying at all I Has Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of man what God has in store for them that love him oh oh so we can never know what's going to be Heaven it's just going to be great read the next verse but God has revealed them unto us by his spirit so we can know we can know the things that God has in store for us we can't know it by human thinking we can't know it by Logic and reason logic and reason the best It produced I guess in history was Plato Aristotle Socrates and what was their Viewpoint well flesh physical things are evil spiritual things are good so their Viewpoint of Heaven is it's a spiritual place there's nothing physical about it it's only spiritual you go you go to this cloud and see that type of thinking if you understand the early church many of the theologians of the early church were also the head professor of a philosophical School in Alexandria and the different places of learning back then and so they combined Greek philosophy with Biblical understanding and they came to a perversion about many things it's not an un other Earthly place and the physical is only evil because of the Fall it's not inherently evil right God intends to change all that that's that's why Christ came in the flesh and put sin to Death In the Flesh why because he's going to change he's going to make all things new he's going to renew everything it's it's not that we when this body dies we go to some spiritual body no God's ultimate purpose is that our theophany and this body become one into a glorified body and that's a physical thing Jesus says touch me for a spirit has not Flesh and Bones see he has a resurrected Lord Jesus he was physical he could be touched he had nail scars still in his hand I believe that's going to be an eternal memorial for our Redemption for all of eternity he'll have nail scars as a memory for us even even the very word Redemption speaks of this Redemption we think we we many times think of redemption and salvation it's not exactly the same word to save something doesn't mean the same thing as redeeming something redeeming something is you lost it now you need to go and pay a price to get it back so then you pay the price and then you have to take it back at Calvary Jesus Christ paid the price right but he hasn't taken it back yet that's only the first part of redemption now he's got to take it back and remember he didn't he didn't just pay the price for you for your soul he paid the price for the whole thing he prayed the price for all of redemption both the Earth that you're living in and the Earth that you're living on both have to be completely redeemed not only that but it's speaking of a payment of Ransom someone has been sold under slavery so you pay that Ransom so that person can be set free and be released from slavery Romans 8 23 speaks of this not only they not only they the creation ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption the Redemption to it the Redemption of our bodies we're waiting for that full release we're still our bodies are still under a form of slavery we still sin we still go towards evil even though in our in our soul we don't want to do that but there's a nature there that's taking us toward that that itself has to be redeemed that release will take place but we also know that creation itself is groaning creation itself will be released and set free from bondage when after we are when we're set free when we become fully manifested as Sons then the creation can be set free as well the reality of our future State needs to become a revelation to us it can't be just a side issue one of many doctrines that we think about and talk about it needs to be a reality because if we don't if we don't see Heaven correctly and we don't have a longing and a passion for the for what God has for us in the future then I believe we become useless and become fruitless because when you have a real revelation of what God's plans are for us our future home then he'd become Fearless then you can risk lay aside everything but if your whole thinking is just limited to oh I have to serve him now the Christians long ago had that vision of their future State they had that vision of their reward and they could go and had become Martyrs and sacrifice a sacrifice there they could give up their lives were too much tied to this life to this place we have it so comfortable so easy um we we speak about heaven in America and you know it's oh man that's really that's really neat that's the reaction speak about heaven in a place where people are suffering and the tears are rolling and the thankfulness is coming thinking about oh my this is what we have to offer not that it wouldn't come for us but we become so comfortable here we need we need to have that idea that comfortableness blown up because we shouldn't be comfortable here this isn't our home we're pilgrims and strangers here Genesis chapter 2 verses 9. through 15 we're going to read and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the site and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil and a river went out of Eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into four heads the name of the first is python that is it which can pass it the whole land of havilah where there is gold and the gold of that land is good there's bedelium and the Onyx Stone and the name of the second river is gehon the same is it that can passeth the whole land of Ethiopia in the name of the third river is hidikal that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria and the fourth river is Euphrates and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it this is before the fall so here we have God creating this place for his glory to be seen and enjoyed he created all these things not only that but if you look at this closely he created stones and metal precious metal and he put them in the Earth right and so he tell and then he tells Adam I'm putting you here to dress and to keep the garden now God created the garden but he intended for man to maintain that Garden before the fall right brother Branham says when we go to heaven we're not going to play a harp on on a cloud but we're going to live we're going to work we're going to eat we're going to real life he says so understand that this restoration it's a restoration Adam was that put there to work work isn't a bad thing work is is actually what we were created to do Jesus said my father worketh hitherto and I work right so we're made God is a worker God Is Creative he made us in His image we are to be creative we're to work we're to make order the speaking of a garden itself is speaking of something that has order to it has shape to it not only that but he put as I said he put gold and different stones in the earth why because he intended for man to dig and to find it and to create something with it right he put that creativity in the heart of man to do it he wanted us to build a city is what city has order to it right it and it takes building it takes CR it takes a creative touch to do that and he put that within us to work God made all of these things he did it he didn't just make the just leave it there let it be wild and just go off and sit under a palm tree for all of eternity we'll have plenty of time to sit under a palm tree however however there's there's work and I I believe that the worst thing for a person today is to be born into a situation where they never have to work in their life it's it's horrible that's not just a result of the Fall that's just in general that's the position of us as created in the image and likeness of God we are not made to sit and be lazy we're made with bodies to work to work hard to exert ourselves to create something to accomplish things God made us to do that he put it in our hearts and in our lives to do that and it's not a result of the fall this is what God's purpose was to do in the beginning the curse wasn't oh Adam now you're going to have to cultivate food no the curse was now when you're cultivating food there will be thorns and thistles that will come see there there was going to be Farmers before the fall there was going to be Shepherds before the fall there was going to be people that were Builders there was going to be people that dug in the ground before the fall all of these things that we we don't think about very much at all those things were to be there before the fall only difference was there was North Thorns or thistles or evil or sickness or pain or injury there to to hinder all of that and there's eventually there'll be no devil to get involved and bring destruction now everything that man touches is what it's from the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil there's good every technology that comes it seems there's good and a whole lot of evil that wasn't God's original intent and purpose for man man is to to invent and create and make works of art and books and poetry and these things without the influence of Satan there amen let's stand and pray gracious father we come before you Lord and we just want to commit ourselves again to you Lord we ask that your presence would be with us that you would be glorified in our midst Lord that we would just turn our eyes from the things of the world and turn them towards you as we worship Lord anoint the anoint the musicians anoint the preacher and anoint each believer here father to receive of you we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you thank you thank you [Music]
