greet you in the name of the Lord this evening happy to have all here with us amen God bless you Matthew chapter 12 Sarah good to see you again amen praise the Lord um we want to just uh tie in tonight so I was convinced I could finish everything last Sunday and I got about halfway so I said okay I'll finish it in part eight and that would have worked worked except that the Lord stuck another part in between that so this will be part eight and we'll have to try to come to Sunday with part nine amen now if the Rapture occurs I'll have to preach it in glory amen praise the Lord I would love to be preaching a sermon when the trumpet sounds amen would that be something be here gathered on a Sunday morning and that door burst open and Saints from who have gone on just walk in Among Us and go it's over oh Hallelujah my goodness praise the Lord Matthew chapter 12 verse um let's let's just read verse 41 and 42 it's familiar to us we've been studying it so I just wanted to start here to connect last Sunday to tonight verse 41 Matthew 12:41 the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas's here the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here master we thank you for your word tonight there's a blessing in reading it there's a blessing in hearing it read and Lord we've did both and so I'm asking for your Divine favor Lord to take this thought and break it to the people as you've dealt with my own Heart Lord and this thought is one of those that's very close to personal to me Lord so I I just want to get out of the way and allow Lord the experiences of my life to be a witness to the people Lord let me speak freely I pray in Jesus name amen God bless you friend you can be seated now very quickly I want to move very quickly being a Wednesday night we were commenting to you on Sunday concerning the men of Nineveh and concerning the queen of the South which we know to be the Queen of Sheba that it was it was something that they did it was actually something that was a performance of their faith in their life in other words it was more than just lip service it was more than just something they said and we were contrasting that last Sunday as we were coming down near the end to show you that that's really really what this Series has been about because you remember that we've been dealing the difference between logos and Rema and they're both the word of God but they but the when it's the word of God in established form that's the logos but when that word uh moves upon some person and that person becomes a living reality of that word of that established word then that's Rema we've given you example after example our favorite one is to go to Mary and I'm don't not going to go back there tonight um got some more to say on that this Sunday but we were finishing with how that you know Mary picked up the 700 year old prophecy I mean you're talking about something powerful all she hears is a 700 year old logos and and something strikes her and here's a big point it was not something she could reach to herself it because just being convinced of the validity convinced that the logos written in Isaiah in Isaiah 712 years prior the fact that she believed that was a true prophecy just being convinced of it mentally would not have produced her a to bring forth a a virgin birth but what happened is the spirit of God Came Upon her at that moment say well he overshadowed her he did but that was never going to arrive he first had to come and reveal not only that the word was true but she would be the vessel and God would do it and it was happening and it was now and and and Beyond her own reasoning which said this is impossible Beyond her own human fears saying I can't do it don't we say that Lord I know you you're promised a bride and I but I read that a bride is perfect and I just that too you know if if Jesus was standing here tonight and trying to give you the word about a virgin born bride at the end time and you would say to him Lord I just don't see how I can be that Jesus might look at you and say been there done that Mary felt the same way every one of my Apostles felt the same way but I'm here to tell you like I told Abraham I've only come here to tell you what I've already done amen you're my family and that's why you are predestinated before the foundation of the world so it it's something more when when Rema strikes you Rema is not Rema is not in play until you are projecting The Word Alive in other words if it just stays convinced in your mind it's just logos see but but when you believe it then it becomes life to you that's why Jesus would say my words to you are spirit and they are life we read that we might look at that again here in a moment we're going to look at a lot of scriptures all right so so we found that we were showing you that it's not so much what the Queen of Sheba said although she had a testimony it's not just so much you know what the men of Nineveh said it's what they did they repented she crossed the desert she got kicked out of her Society she she forsook everything she ever knew just to go to one church service to hear Solomon and Jesus said she'll rise with this generation and condemn it because she went just to hear Solomon and a greater than Solomon is hereen all right so so when we I I said to you last Sunday that remember that when you read in Revelation 1 and three we found out that the the the the command to the church in the very first chapter is blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep now you're going to need three out of three see you're going to blessed is he that readeth and they that hear and they that keep the things which are written in the book and we find that when he that principle of hearing recognizing and acting upon the word of God is a principle all through 2,000 years and every age you say how could we how could William brandham identify the right messenger and the right movement from ages thousands of years ago hundreds and even thousands of years ago because he used that principle he could look in history and find the single group that didn't just hear and didn't just Anon with joy but they actually understood and then they didn't just hear it and understand it but they acted upon it and that's why he was able to go down through there and say this is why I chose irenius over his teacher polycarp because polycarp heard recognized and acted but polycarp had a little bit of a a mentality toward denominationalism whereas irenius was militantly against that and it so happens that the Holy Ghost is militantly against that against that he's not for organized religion and so brother Brandon was able to use that same criteria to identify every messenger and identify every movement that's why he chose the movement of Martin Luther over the movement of zwingley zwingley was a powerful movement but when it when when the prophet looked into the word of God to see who was really hearing and recognizing the truth of the hour and acting upon it that wasn't swingly he was close no doubt he was a servant of the Lord but God chose Luther because Luther crystallized that Revelation and he acted upon it and it coalesced a movement around it amen same thing with Wesley same thing with a and it it wasn't that you know Wesley was the only fish in the sea but he was the one who who would hear and recognize and act and when you come and we took you there and we're not going there tonight to Revelation uh 202 and uh six and seven you find it saying he said unto me these saying are faithful and true I want to say to you tonight that these sayings are faithful and they're true am and they work and it isn't just a pipe dream that you can become this you can and you are and you shall amen amen he has never failed in any age to bring his family to the Rema of the word that they were the Living Word of their hour this is exactly why they are part of the first resurrection this is why the foolish virgin are not amen see they have sanctification they have justification but you can be justified without being Sanctified Justified of your past sins that doesn't help you in the future it just means you repented of your past deeds and God forgave you but but if you don't get Sanctified you've got to go on and let the Holy Spirit start working in your flesh and sanctify your lives that's a work of the Holy Ghost but then you've got to you've got to completely die and be born completely Again by the same working of the same Holy Spirit in a further work and and the foolish virgin go through justification and they go through sanctification but they don't get the oil they don't get the new birth they're not part of the first resurrection they sleep during the Thousand-Year Millennium they go to the Judgment bar and are judged for their life the bride avoids all of that the bride is seated with him on the throne her sins have already went ahead of her by the time you get there they're already dealt with you don't want your sins to follow you there some men's sins go before them to judgment the Bible says some men sins follow after them you want to be the kind that it goes before you in and is judged in Christ all right so he says here and he said unto me in Revelation 226 and 7 he said unto me these things are faithful and true and the Lord God of the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done behold I come quickly blessed is he and here it is again that same exact word in English and in Greek blessed is he that keepeth the saying of the prophecy of this book so now when I've got the that principle in chapter one and I've got the principle after John has been shown a Riv a pure River of water he's already been shown the the the the beauty of of Jerusalem he's already been and now the it's the last it's just the wrapping up I come quickly I've sent my angel when I can read it at the beginning of the church ages that his family are those who hear recognize and keep the word and then I can read that the people who who are standing staring at that pure River of Water of Life and I'm I'm going to be that person and the requirement has not changed that you hear recognize and Obey you keep and you don't just keep it I showed you last Sunday you guard it you guard it that's going to become important in just in a moment all right now let's go through some scriptures together and I I I subtitled this the testimony of Jesus because remember the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy yes amen and that's what Revelation 13 is prophecy to Revelation 226 and7 it's showing that this is the principle and and it's going to reach because in the same book he wrote the church that starts is the church that finishes and we're going to make it good news we're going to make it I've read the back of the book the requirement didn't change I'm I'm meeting the same requirement Paul met so that's why brother random said I preach what Paul priest will Paul's group make it yes then my group will make it hallelujah praise God all right so now watch so we're talking about keeping his word it's a very big topic because a Believer loves to keep God's word there's really nothing of such consternation to a Believer is when they fail to keep God's word even people like myself who is always a cup is half full kind of guy get it from my dad the sun is always shining even if it's cloudy I just say well it's just above the clouds it'll be out tomorrow and if it's not tomorrow the next day but even I can get way down in the dumps if I don't find myself measuring up to the standard for the hour in which I live you're looking at a man who wants to measure up to the standard Hallelujah watch what he says here now Paul's instructions to the church at at thessalonica he says but we are bound now we're talking about keeping the word that's the sign of the church she keeps the word we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because uh let me keep up with myself because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth so you're not going to be able I'm sorry if this hurts your feelings but it doesn't do you any good to believe God sent a prop profet if you don't live a Sanctified life you still have 1 ounce of Victory Brother JD was preaching on this Wednesday and brother Matt two Wednesdays before that under the true atonement and uh the other one on atonement and then brother JD comes behind and and and just complimented those two from Brother Matt and I thought tonight this is I could see why the holy spirit is doing this friends we're almost home and it's God saying I need you to be ready see so watch because somebody is going to become the Rema oh my somebody's going to become the Rema of that that's logos that's established truth but eight billion other people aren't becoming that but there is a people who not only are it but want to be it oh man I'm going have to keep going I'm getting so excited all right let me move on weing two he called you what what did he call me to to be to to have salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth it's a package deal amen amen where to he called you by Our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ it is so selfish to not let your light shine because it's supposed to be to the glory of our Lord Jesus Jesus Christ it's so selfish to live as a Believer and I'm just going to give you credit that you're a real one you're authentic you've got a gene you really believe it but you live carnal you live on the edges you don't do what's necessary to stay spiritual you ought to be ashamed of yourself see therefore Brethren Stand Fast amen and and hold the Traditions which ye have been taught from the NLT stand firm and keep a strong grip on the teaching we passed on to you whether by word or our epistle I want to say to you keep a grip come on let's not let this thing slip I know it's 2023 and it's about to be 2024 but I say we get a strong grip on the word of God and say it doesn't change and neither do we change we're serious about serving God he writes on further in his pastoral letters one here to Timothy a second letter to Timothy nevertheless I love this nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity amen so the first part is God knowing who are his that's the first part let's get that straight God knoweth them that are his I can't help who walked in it for decades and then walked away God knoweth them that are his I can't help the critics of the world with their nonsense but I know this God knoweth them that are his and that comforts me because when I fail I stand up and I say Satan God knoweth them that are his Hallelujah but notice the conjunction and right there and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity so the second part so the first part is God knowing who are his the second part is a life that testifies to the Redemptive work of Christ you're not going to get around that it's let everyone who nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity our life is to be is is to be an identified Life as a Living Testament Amen to the sealing work of the Holy Ghost are you willing to let your life be a seal and a proof to the world that the sealing of the Holy Ghost changes a man see all right he goes on verse 20 but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore catch it if a man therefore let God Purge him let the preacher Purge him let the Deacon Purge him amen even the Hitman purging you wouldn't give you eternal life even brother Jason even if you come to my office and I've got a thumb screw back there that wouldn't give you Eternal I'd Purge you but it wouldn't give you eternal life if a man therefore Purge him self from these brother Jason how can I overcome if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel of Honor I want to be a vessel of Honor okay there's a there's a method to this there's a method it's it's not Madness you can be an overcomer you purge yourself and make yourself a vessel of Honor Sanctified and meet for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work well do you think of your life as is preparing your life for every good work I'm preparing myself so that the Holy Ghost can work through me I'm preparing myself for that you see all right you're following along right he goes on he's gonna I mean Paul's not going to let this go he's going to turn the screws even harder amen flee also youthful lust but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart oh I just thought the Lord was going to perform all this in me as brother Jason said last Wednesday he he he'll do it through you but he won't do it for you right the bride hath made herself ready see back up if a man therefore Purge himself from these flee youthful lust but follow righteous righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart listen friends I can tell you from experience this requires tenacity and determination and grit and you finally to say I am a believer and this world is not my home and I will not allow it to rule over me and when you do that then God will come down and help you say I want him to help me and he help me he will brother brandham said he cares do you care and he says he will care but you got to care first see if you're still you know one foot in the in the in the gospel and one foot in the world and you don't have come to church you don't have your family at church half the time shame on you dads and moms who don't have your family at church every service that's humanly possible and I know not every service is humanly possible possible of course I know that that goes without saying but I'll just say it for your sake but when it's possible which it should be most of the time if you have aligned your life correctly there is nothing more important in this day of Satan's Eden than having your family in the house of God to enjoy the presence of God and feel the Holy Spirit and let the preaching of the Gospel wash your mind and wash their mind it is so powerful I have seen people sit in message churches including this one for years and they were never born again and it proved it once they quit coming to church and their life blew to Kingdom come and got into all kinds of Twisted perversion but the fact that they didn't do it or it was extremely limited while they were coming here is Testament to the washing effect of the word they weren't even getting born again but they were just coming here and under the presence and under the preaching they're getting their Spirit washed it's a powerful thing see but but when parents let their own careers and their own activities and their own schedules they don't have come to church their kids don't have come to church come on Friends how's God SP what do you expect God to do amen my I tell you something friends it's just time to take the gloves off we're too close to home Hallelujah all right he says so flee off also youthful lust but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart he goes on to the church at colasse he writes if ye then be risen with Christ how many that means you're born again nine of you how many are risen with Christ about a little over half of you are you are you born again of the spirit of God I need to change my text if I got that many people who aren't even born again all right so so if you be risen with Christ seek the world in a new career I'm sorry I I apologize if if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which make you happy chase the world get a little bit here and a little bit there you know get more likes be more popular if you be risen with Christ seek those things which are above what are you doing chasing things down here you should be seeking those things above where Christ sth on the right hand of of God sitting on the right hand of God is power no wonder you don't have power in your home in your life in your testimony you're not seeking the place of power all right all right on the right hand of God set oh excuse me uh set your affection on things above not on things on the Earth Earth that Colossians 3 1 and 2 that is so gripping I could just stand you up and dismiss and you could go home and you'd be benefited having just read that if you would just follow that listen friends if you would just follow that it would fix probably 99% of every problem you've got in your life in your family in your children in your finances in in in your spirituality in your prayer life you're talking about power to cast out Devils you're talking about power to take chaos and bring it back into order because you commanded it so do you realize that's the whole plan of the Holy Ghost that's what the Holy Ghost is given for to empower the church to be Jesus Christ in the earth see brother brandham when he says we we we're Kings but we live like poppers it wasn't just the fact that oh we we just chose to live as poppers we weren't claiming our spiritual rights it's really be see all right set your affections on things above not on things on the earth for ye are dead you're supposed to be and your life is hid with Christ in God Amen so this is why brother Brandon would say you go so far into God Satan can can't even find you well how could he if you were hidden in with Christ in God I mean brother R say you're sealed in he sealed out all right when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory I good news here this thing ends really well this thing ends really well Hallelujah you get the prize Hallelujah you get you say our a pot of gold that's a pot of gold is Jump change compared to what we're getting Hallelujah a pot of gold is nothing they pave streets with that stuff in glory you shall appear with him in glory now I W to Carry On from verse I'm gonna uh let's see I wanna okay let me let me read verse five mortify Therefore your members this is your body which which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupisent and covetousness which is actually idolatry all right now I'm going to take from verse five and I'm going to read down through 10 from the New Living Translation so put to death the sinful Earthly things lurking within you amen remember JD broke that down for us friends yeah you're born again but you still got things lurking within you in this flesh is not redeemed amen flesh and Bone cannot inherit the Kingdom of Heaven Jesus said so it's got to be changed this Fallen flesh is not going to inherit the kingdom of God it's going to be changed and you'll have a body liken unto his glorious body see put to death how do you put something to death you kill it how should I kill it I don't don't know choke it strangle it starve it burn it whatever just apply it whatever's got you bound starve it strangle it choke it kick it out of your life this isn't rocket science see put to death the sinful Earthly things lurking within you have nothing to do with sexual immorality impurity lust and evil desires don't be greedy for a greedy person is an idolator worshiping the things of this world because of these sins the anger of God is coming you used to do those things when your life was still part of this world but now it is the time to get rid of anger rage malicious behavior slander dirty language don't lie to each other for you have stripped off your old sinful nature and all its Wicked Deeds is that beautiful now it now it's obviously it's obvious that Paul is speaking to people in his mind who are born again well then if if I'm born again if Paul wouldn't be saying giving me these instructions if it wasn't true as brother Jason was showing us it's still true that I can let my flesh get the better of me and I have to go back and repent again Paul knew that I you know I've heard I've heard you know and there's there's certainly truth to it of course it's true brother brandom said it he T starts talking about heinous sins and and adultery and different things like that and and he says of course my Holy Ghost would keep me from that and that almost becomes like a blanket thing to say really what they're saying is you should never have a mistake at all until you pin them on that and they go well no you're going to have mistakes okay well then now since you're the arbitrator tell me tell me where that crosses the line so so you say well but the my Holy Spirit would keep me from that well of course no kidding the holy spirit's never going to agree with you sinning he's never gonna he's never going to be okay with that but he's not going to force you either he you you if you're his child he'll wear you out and you'll wish you hadn't done it amen but I he still loves me I've still passed from Death unto life see but I'm instructed don't let these things rule in your members see all right um 10 put on your new nature and in other words live according to the Inner Man let your outer man be a represent ation of Your Inner Man put on your new nature and be renewed I mean listen friends look at what you're reading you put on your new nature you can't give yourself a new nature you can't born birth Yourself by the new birth that of course it has to be God to give you a new nature Paul's not saying save yourself he's saying live the outside according to the inside put down love and evil concupisent and and don't have anything to do with these things bring your flesh under subjection to the holy spirit amen make whatever changes you feel you need to make put on your new nature and be renewed as you learn to know your Creator and become like him brother Matt had this quote I don't remember if he put it up I'm going to put it up tonight but he was quoting from it so powerful what he was preaching um his two parts there brother B talking about the New Birth when this takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that that the spirit that comes in you from the New Birth you here's what it'll do you will believe and do everybody say believe and do believe you will believe and do everything that God says in his word for you to do that that's that's what's that's what the Holy Ghost is given for might I sometimes fail to do that yes you might not only fail to do it you might be you might fail to believe it and God have to come down and rebuke your unbelief put you through a trial and show you you actually believe it more than you think you do there's nothing like a trial to give you desperation and prove to you that you're more of a Believer than you thought you were oh my God has ways friends amen all right he has ways but here's the overriding principle of the new birth you will believe and do everything that God says in his word for you to do there is a big difference between making mistakes and even even getting overwhelmed by a desire because your prayer life is slack your church attendance is slack your consuming of the word of God is slack your consuming of Netflix is high yeah come on amen yeah Bible consumption prayer time way low way low Church schedule way low ESPN way high yeah amen is this okay oh yeah amen YouTube really high Facebook out of this world Instagram all the other Gams and all I'm not even going to start down the list I don't even know what I'm half what I'm talking about on most of them but I do know this and I do know what this will do if you make this the biggest part of your diet I know what'll happen to you if you don't say how do you know cuz I've done it and I've found myself a slack and I just found that it I didn't lose a new birth I just lost I got my priorities I let I let the siren song of the world you know sing me to sleep and the next thing you know you know you got you got days I I tell you I'm so glad God taught me that early in my Christian experience Prayer Changes Everything amen amen prayer we preached on it here some time ago prayer is you in a partnership with God prayer is not a wish list prayer certainly not to change God's mind from what he would otherwise not do uh prayer is to change your mind see but prayer gives you the partnership with God just like Jesus partnered when he said to his disciples the Harvest is truly white uh the field is white Under Harvest but the labors are few pray ye the lord of the Harvest that he sent forth labors and brother brandham said here he was standing there he was the lord of the Harvest and he's saying to them pray to the Lord of the Harvest and brother brandham said in other words Jesus was saying look I want to do this but I want you to pray and ask me prayer is you in a partnership with God hallelujah you can travel the world vicariously through prayer for JD goes overseas you don't know what he might face he don't know what he might face but God knows what he might face and God is it will will anoint you to hit your knees and you don't even know why and you start praying for him and you've just you've done what Paul did Paul said my spirit there with you you have literally crossed an ocean through prayer this is Supernatural friends you literally move into another realm what a privilege prayer is I literally can move through Dimensions while I'm on my knees speaking to God I've lifted myself up into Heavenly places and I'm projecting the word of God I am God praying through me prayer is one of the most privileged things you can ever have a hold of it makes you a coworker with Christ see you might never go to the Middle East but you can go there in prayer you might you might never stand in this pull pit and preach a sermon but you can by praying for the preacher standing hereen see oh I gotta fly all right now all right you will believe and do everything that God says in his word for you to do and everything that the Bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen amen now that's in your life talk is cheap amen amen means so be it in other words it's things in my life so be it Lord what that's what Mary said be it unto me Mary didn't say okay I agree Mary Said Amen to the word be it unto me according to your words I can't produce it I'm not the one said it you said it so you do it but I'll believe it and I'll do my part whatever I've got to do Hallelujah see everything that the Bible quotes you to do you'll punctuated with an amen and you'll not stop day and night until you receive it that's right that's right and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit you say will I speak in tongues you might do that and you might not will I shout you might do that you might not but there's one sure thing you will do you will bear the Fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of the spirit is love it's Joy it's peace it's Faith it's longsuffering meekness gentleness patience your temper will not be oh just remember just remember when you got that the poisons that poisons the holy spirit away from you can't control that temper can't control your spirit Solomon said you're like an unwalled City the enemy just walks in and out he ever he chooses see so he says um that old po that poisons the holy spirit away from me it breaks my heart to read those words I can't imagine that there's been time where I poisoned to the Holy Ghost amen after everything he's done for me when you get to a place that you want to uh fuss with everybody my goodness uh you come along too there's something wrong when you get a place where the a minister will read from the Bible boy I've had my share this read something from the Bible that it's wrong to do a certain thing and you'll just remember there's no Christianity there at all you know I've had people just get so mad at me because I was teaching things we shouldn't do out of the Bible and I just say what I say now what's ID there's no Christianity there at all that's why they were doing it that's why they still do there's no Christianity there at all see that's now that by their fruits you shall know them that's what Jesus said if if it's the word uh let's see if it's the word of God and God said so that spirit in you will cope with that word every time cuz genuine and holy spirit will cope with the word cuz the word is life and spirit Jesus said my words are life now I've been breaking that down for you and fact is uh take that down brother Josh and and get ready to pull up some scriptures and do it all super super fast amen all right now we've read to you and we won't need to go there Josh we're going to go to John 663 and I've we we know John 1:1 in the beginning was the logos the word the logos was with God and the logos was God it's the established word see all right and uh and then the logos was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and became a human all right but when you go to John 663 Jesus is saying it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life the words that I speak unto you now that's Rema see because the purpose of the word is not to just stay ink on paper it's more than just your mental agreement with the teaching it's your willingness to let this get written behind skin or not and and if that's your decision then then I'll just say welcome to the tribulation and welcome to the judgment bar good luck with that I hope the best for you but I don't plan to go there I don't plan to get left behind I plan to go up when the trumpet sounds I plan to be seated on the throne you say well how do you know you won't stand the Judgment oh I am standing the Judgment everybody stands the Judgment Paul said we all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ that's not the question the question is when and where and since this right now this is the Judgment seat of Christ then I choose Here and Now I don't want to choose there and then I'll choose here and now see all right so John 15 uh verse one all right here it is Jesus says I am the True Vine we're going to go John 15 I think 1 through eight brother Josh I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman that's a farmer it's a gardener it's the it's the caretaker right but but most perfectly a husbandman is a farmer which is exactly that's just so perfect of the Holy Ghost just like a farmer plants a seed and cares for it while it grows keeps the weeds out and harvests it see and so Jesus talks about you know taking the wheat to the Garner and the chaff is burned with unquenchable fire so he's a good farmer so he knows what he's talking about I am the True Vine and my father is the husband and every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit no I'm sorry you're you're not going to Disney World you're going to get purged so you can get more fruit now watch now watch this this is this is a tricky now ye are clean through the logos that's what I was saying a while ago just reading the logos just just hearing it red there's a blessing there's a washing of the water just coming under and having somebody teach this to you there's a washing I've seen it happen to people who sat in churches and lived mostly Sanctified and some of them lived incredibly Sanctified lives for decades and then and then quit church and as soon as they quit church and left the message uh they backslid almost overnight breathtakingly fast immediately they did it and so and then and and then try to claim they're still a Christian that's just not true I'm sorry that's just not true say does that finish them not for me to say thank God that's for the Lord that's the the judge will make that decision not me see I just know I'm a Believer and I'm going all the way amen watching that clock it's going fast now you are clean through the word the logos which I've spoken unto you now catch this word abide in me interesting uh I'm trying to think of his name now it escapes my mind um oh goodness but uh made made some comments got my mind thinking pointed out the fact that how that Jesus in the early part of his ministry would always say to his disciples follow me and he says isn't it curious that right before he leaves the Earth and goes home he now he now says something further it's not just follow me but abide in me amen see because see the Holy Ghost is coming the church is getting ready his kingdom is getting ready to be in the earth see so it's not just there are the world is filled with followers of Jesus but there's a big difference between following him and abiding in him or you and him and he and you see abide in me and I in you don't just follow me don't just agree with me abide uh a as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the Vine you are the branches he that abideth in me see this is your daily life this is your this is what I was this is what everything I've been saying that it's it's you adjusting and arranging your life this this is an action word this isn't just you know something a nice thought oh I abide in Christ what does that even mean you you do you I I I abide in Christ and he abides in me well then why does your life look the way it looks it doesn't look like this yeah but a Believer and I follow it oh I'm not accusing you of not following him I'm I'm saying do you abide in him does your life show that you're not that you're more than just following right amen there were many the Bible says that followed him no longer remember that they they and and they they all abandoned him Jesus said to his disciples will you go also they said Lord where do we go you have the the words of eternal life amen so he comes into verse five I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him this is the one this is the same one that bringeth forth much fruit for without me abiding in you and you in me you can do nothing see if a man abide not in me he cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you AB in me and my words abide in you now catch it if you abide in me and my Rema amen abide in you not just the established word not just your mentally following this but but has your life become this then you're abiding in him he's abiding in you the word that if you abide in me if you abide in me and my words my Rema abide in you you're the one who will ask what you will and it shall be done to you you're the one herein who my father in who will my father will be glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples amen you who have become the Living Word you who are in other words you who allow the word to live in you all the time amen amen abide in me see so so he so he's establishing them through the established word the logos uh that we read in verse three but but but if that's true give me verse three again Josh so now you're clean through the logos which I have spoken unto you so the question becomes com then why does not the nominal church member live clean if they have the logos if they and they do they read from the same book they've got them in their Library just like I do they've got them in their pews just like we do they have the logos just like you have the logos but verse seven is showing it's got to come from Ink to skin it's got to be a living thing it's got the Liv living Saints those who are alive with the Life of Christ him abiding in them them abiding in him that's the ones who will ask the father in my name that's the ones who will have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit see so Rema must be in play for the established word to live out of his disciples that's the point Jesus is trying to get them to understand you're not just going to follow me anymore boys you're going to need to go you're getting ready to heaven an experience that's going to take you deeper than just following me my Ministry Jesus is saying to them my Ministry is about to multiply now not like you think probably you're you're going to be surprised how it happens you're going to get discouraged and think Calvary is a is a devastating defeat but what you're going to find out later oh my is on that morning on Resurrection morning I will Ascend with all power in Heaven and Earth and I'll send you into Jerusalem and I'll come down among you and then you will be me in the Earth again in a many membered body Hallelujah that's what it means to be a message believer say what what was the early Church in Jerusalem Message Church oh of course of course it was the message isn't a new thing the message is a restoration of what already was we just call it the message it's the gospel is what it is but but but the the beauty of this version of it is that it's the full complete revitalizing the full complete repairing of the altar the full complete restoration the full complete Christ the the brother brandham said brother brandham said a full promise from a full God and that makes a full believer hallelujah oh my so we see then that that this that what Jesus is showing them that the word must go from logos to Rema and this actually is the non-negotiable I know trinitarian preachers like to preach that belief in the Trinity is the non-negotiable which is ridiculous right amen because you've just threw out all the apostles because they never believed the Trinity because it didn't even exist see and then and then even when they they finally started putting it together as brother JD has showed us in his Sunday School classes they didn't even have it all formed up it took hundreds of years and it was a work in progress so what my goodness U what the apostles didn't believe in the Trinity no one had even ever used that word they knew here o Israel the Lord your God is one they knew Jesus was God they they knew who he was they weren't they weren't they you say how do you know that they knew who he was because not what they said but what they did they heard him say baptize in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost and when they applied that they baptized people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hello it's not hard they understood clearly who he was see their actions proved that they had the Revelation see so oh my I'm I'm out of time stand up we're done God bless you amen praise the Lord amen oh I want to keep going trust me but I would need a long time so we we might get Sunday as 9: and next next Sunday or Wednesday is 10 11 12 13 14 amen you love the word of God friends I I I think you've absorbed enough tonight I think that I was able to make at least one of my first main
