minute last minute announcements and I forget them the one thing that I just want to express is my deep gratitude on behalf of my entire team from bethl Tabernacle and all of the amazing volunteers and counselors and staff and uh it's just been incredible it has exceeded all of our expectations and you made that possible and on behalf of all of us who have put on this camp and I'm probably the least uh of of the one and uh but I just want to say thank you amen give yourself a hand amen hallelujah it's it's our third year and uh we have this new facility is our first time using it I trust that you've enjoyed it and that um you feel like it's time well spent resources and money well spent I hope your parents feel that way amen we certainly um have endeavored to try to think of everything we possibly could that you never totally successful in that and I'm glad that the Lord doesn't you know gr us uh on our wins and losses I'm glad he looks at our heart and sees our intent I'm glad it's that way in my Christian Life I'm glad the Lord doesn't look at my w and my L columns you know and say boy these losses are piling up yeah I know it Lord I'm really sorry you know but but the Lord looks on our heart and David asks the Lord Carolina Camp I hope you like the flavor amen amen you have to come South to get good cooking sorry Northerners but so we we have our own way of doing things we don't care too much how you do it up where you live um we're kind of that way amen praise the Lord and uh we we love the Lord with all of our heart we love you we're glad you were here and trust it was a great benefit you know like brother brandham said if you're eating cherry pie and you come to a seed and don't throw the whole pie out you know if after today by today's ending of today's service you will have accumulated you will have sit through about 18 hours of singing and worship Ministry of the word and prayer is it well spent amen praise the Lord and I just want to so you know uh if if if there was a a few minutes or some minutes against that 18 hours please don't let some minutes throw 18 hours out of your head I believe it was a great value uh to the Lord's bride amen so we're thankful to the Lord for that we hope to do it again next year if we're here we hope we're not here so we hope we don't do it next year but if we're here we do plan to do it again and we invite you all to come back I'd like to say bring somebody but you won't be able to because the camp was full within about an hour and we had 75 people on a waiting list we just had to turn it off and I apologize to all of those who didn't get to come so just next year have your trigger finger ready and be ready when the registration opens and click quickly amen use use a sniper app and just you know click five times for five of your friends amen and uh we we hope that uh to be able and I I'm I'm you know we this this Camp was a lot more costly and we were able by the help of the Lord to subsidize your price amen and the price of the counselors I would have loved to have subsidized everybody's price I just couldn't afford it and uh the team is telling me already next year brother Jason we're going to have to you know charge what we're getting charged and I haven't agreed to that so you pray for me to stand strong against all my team amen praise the Lord I haven't agreed to do that yet so uh I hope next year by the help of the Lord hey I tell you what you can do they sent me an announcement said concessions are half price today so don't don't run out now have it for half price and if you get at the back of the line you might get it free I don't know I'm just saying don't quote me on that amen I'll deny it but but amen and so hey you know what that does that helps that helps me our our concessions and hey how about that gourmet coffee bar wow wow and I'd like to thank brother Kenny and uh sister Caitlyn who are the owners of the Urban Brew and sister Anita now working with them and they came here and worked uh tirelessly that coffee bar just stayed hopping around the clock and uh brother Ken and uh sister Nita and sister Caitlyn uh donated all the supplies everything that made your coffee they donated and and all of the sales that everything you bought goes back into our fund to help offset some of the subsidy the subsidy to have all y'all here was about 17 grand and so go buy some hot chocolate when you leave here go buy some more coffee go get a candy bar go do something and uh help help me get some of that back we're willing to lose I think you're worth it because if if I if it's our loss but if it's your gain then I just say blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen God bless you to all of my uh team members to all of our counselors to all of our uh workers who work tirelessly behind the scenes who all today have that end of Camp stare when you look them in the eye they have that end of Camp stare and uh don't don't chain too many words together in a sentence they won't catch it so talk slow because they're pretty tired amen and we're just asking the Lord to uh rejuvenate them and you know we we certainly have appreciated the ministry my goodness what quality Ministry my my my goodness I I had such a hard time being behaving myself I have a a situation where I you know probably 12 I don't remember how many weeks or months ago uh the devil attacked me with shingles it went in my eye I've had a second run of it so I'm under doctor's orders to not get too excited and I'm easily excited so it's been difficult and um and after Friday night's service and I helped brother Andrew preach uh I was really uh you know in all the prayer line and the the what you put out for that it my eye was swelling up and I could feel it so I I told Brother Andrew I hate to have to sit on you on Friday night but I'll raise my hand and I'll say Amen but then uh last night with brother Josh he pulled me up out of my seat I couldn't stay seated so I just had to run and chase him down silently amen but uh so I apologize for that if it looked like I was inconsistent believe me I was enjoying it all and like my dad said I I would I would have liked to rose up blowed through the roof and landed in the lake but that was how I felt but I I couldn't do that but I appreciate the Lord coming I think our prayer line last night you know all that is friends if if anybody you know ask a question about that all we're doing is carrying on the traditions of William brandham he held prayer meetings he held prayer lines he designated special calendar events he would he would adjust his sermon to meet that because that builds faith that builds an expectation and so we're just continuing what our Prophet did and and I know that you gained a great benefit from it we plan to do that till the Lord comes I think that the the people have a right to call for the Elders of the church to lay hands upon them and pray amen and the way we do it here that's a little bit unique to us that's kind of how we roll that gives you an opportunity to come up and express your heart you're not just run through quick I'm have no problem with those kinds of Gauntlet prayer lines my dad went through one of those with brother brandham and my dad wanted the discernment line and when brother brandham said we can't do that and and we're just going to have to line up some preachers here and make a gauntlet and run the people through and just quickly lay your hands on him and uh my dad my dad said he said I said no Lord that's not what I wanted and so but then he said man he said when that prayer line started they were they were taking them through and brother Brandon was right in the middle and and as my dad came through brother Brandon wasn't stopping anybody just Lord bless him in Jesus name in Jesus name and he said my dad got right in front of him he stopped and grabbed my dad by the arm and pulled him in close and he stuck his finger in his face and he said you believe don't you son my dad said yes sir amen seven hours away I was healed instantly of an incurable blood disease God still moves amen and I I firmly I firmly uh and that's another thing is my voice I don't know what happened so it just maybe the Lord did that to keep me from damaging my I don't know this it's up to God I don't it's I don't keep up with it just whatever the Lord wants amen but um you know I I I know that the Lord was helping you last night in your needs amen I'm going to get out of the way because if I stay here too long I'll open a text and start preaching but I'm looking forward to uh the the continuation from Brother Josh last night I so enjoyed that amen made so many notes and took so many notes I didn't take a single note of brother Andrew because there's no way to do that you can't keep up with him I got his two opening scriptures and just closed my iPad I said this is pointless so I'll have to go back and get the archive and make all my notes I have notes from every sermon I've ever heard going back years years and years and and and so but but but I was able to take copious amounts of notes from Brother Josh and I'm going to go home and preach all of it so amen praise the Lord God bless you we love you in Christ and we hope to meet you in the morning if I I if we if we don't meet again on this Earth my precious friend I'll see you in the Rapture Hallelujah is that a pledge I'll see you in the Rapture Hallelujah and lastly we want to just be remembering this special day the the Saints there in Johnson City with hurting hearts and they went back home today and uh their counselors and workers and and let's be remembering them all through the day some of the ministry uh brother Andrew headed back brother Barry and different ones brother Diggs and different ones and a lot of people are wanting to get back to attend uh the funeral of our dear sister Erica so will you keep remembering them and the family brother D sister Carol amen will you do that can can I count on you when you leave camp today just be praying for that church and that family that's a hard hard loss amen God bless you praise the Lord

time that we had the first service till now so like when they say Make a Joyful Noise Hallelujah you know what I'm saying so I'm going to be coking a little bit but um I just wanted to briefly say like this whole weekend the Lord has just really been using the the different ministers and speaking to my heart and just confirming different things and I was going uh walking around one of the days and just thinking about how little I am and how big God is and it's even more like clear to like visualize when you're three Canadians four Canadians in a sea of like 400 plus Americans you're like wow Lord I am small but but um even still in the middle of that he comes and he personally deals with you and it just reconfirms to you that he knows your name and he called your name and it was just

Lord we thank you once again for another opportunity and Lord we come to the end of these meetings and the last service now but Lord this is a a special day to us because we've gathered here this morning in the honor of your resurrection and Lord we know that you are in you're truly a living God and and so God we're just Lord so so thankful God to be in your presence and Lord to to to be able to come and and unite our hearts together in a in a in a service like this and we look out and see all these young people and in just a a few moments now they'll they'll be going their separate ways and going back to their homes and their churches and their families and school and all the the things that uh the and and Lord I know that Lord they they come here with troubles and and Lord there was heavy things on their heart hearts and and Lord but we believe that you have you have passed by this way and Lord there's been victories won and deliverances has taken place and we thank you for those things but God we know that they're going to have to go back now and and live their lives but but Lord I pray God that Lord it would be different because Lord they'll realize that greater is he that's in them than he that's in the world Lord there's something inside of them that's greater than the troubles that they'll face Lord we're just asking God that you'd let that Blessed Assurance just rest down in every heart now and and so God as we approach your word Lord we pray that you would just come we know your word is Anointed but God we're asking that you would anoint our hearts and Lord just uh uh uh I pray God that that every heart would be Lord become a resting place for that word to drop down into it and Lord that we would leave here with something in our hearts Lord may we could leave with a testimony Lord like the two that walk with you on the road that day did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke with us along the way Lord be with the the church there in Johnson City at this time and brother Reagan and his family I pray God that there' be a special grace extended to them and Lord I we know God that where more grace is needed Lord you supply more grace and so God we're just praying that the presence of God would be with them there and Lord that you would be with us here this morning and just have your way in this service and we ask these things humbly now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you take your Bibles we'll turn to the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter of Hebrews and I'd like to continue on into the 12th chapter and then I'd like to also read from the book of First Corinthians um in the ninth chapter there and um we um my voice is weak week amen but if you'll help me amen we're going to try to just preach I'm going to give it everything I got I'm going to give you I just give it to the Lord everything we got amen and so uh I appreciate amen the the the monitors amen so it sounds good and I appreciate that help that'll be a great help to me as well amen Hebrews 11 and verse number 32 what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of jethi and of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrot righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword and out of weakness were made strong wax valent in F in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were swn aunder they were they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and inds and the caves of the earth and all these having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore for seeeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God God 1 Corinthians chapter 9 and I'd like to read from the 24th verse First Corinthians 9 Paul says know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the Mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection least that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Cast Away amen I'd like to speak to you this morning on let us run amen you can have your seats you can see here in the scripture that Paul is is using the example of a race I believe that Paul in that time you know the Greeks especially they were well known for being very competitive and their and they had a lot of games and races and things of that nature I figure uh that most of you would understand those things and and uh there's been a lot of uh uh you know the games played here even and things that you've done and and and you know they Paul is is using that as an example uh and he's he's actually using a race that that would be run as an example of our Christian Life and and and so we know that uh in this race that Paul is speaking of here it's not it's not necessarily a race of speed but it's a race of endurance because we know that he said let us run this race with patience so so it's not talking about necessarily who who's going to you know a a race of of of of speed but it's a race of endurance and I believe that the Bible says that or Jesus would say there in the scripture that you'll be hated of of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved see it's not it's not the one that starts the race it's it's the one that finishes he that endureth to the end shall be saved amen so you know I believe that uh uh we've got to endure now Paul was giving us these examples we know in the book of Hebrews there in the 11th chapter that's the that's the uh the heroes of the faith and and God put these things in the scripture to give us examples that we could look into the word of God how many believes the word of God is a mirror and then and and and the prophet said that we got to look in the word and we got to find something in in the scripture we got to find somebody in the scripture that we identify ourselves amen with that with that Bible character there amen because we know that if we can do that then we can see that if they were able to overcome amen then we also will overcome is that right so we God God placed these things in the scripture and Paul was writing of the great Heroes of the faith and then he continues on there in Hebrews 12 and says now being that we're so compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses let us run let us run this race with patience that's been set before us and then he gives us a a uh you know instruction that wh while we're running this race we got to keep our eyes on one thing and one thing alone amen looking unto Jesus amen who is the author and the finisher of our faith amen look as we look at this amen Paul said we got to lay aside every weight amen we got to lay aside every sin that so easily besets us now the prophet would say grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed amen he said until the next Revival no no until the day of redemption is that right amen there's no ups and downs and ins and out when you really get into God if you're really in him not just impersonating something but when you're really in Christ you you you've got one alternative your whole heart is sold out every bridge is burnt behind you and you got your affection set on the things which are above and you run the race with patience that's set before you is that right amen watch as he goes on in another place this is in the word made flesh there uh uh he says they had their opportunity they had their opportunity he's talking about amen those who went before it they had their opportunity he said and we've got ours what are we going to do with it see amen what are we going to do with our OPP listen listen listen to me this morning y this is your opportunity amen they had their time but this is your time he said amen what are we going to do with it see he says he said uh oh just make every ounce of it count for the Lord Jesus have no time for the things of the world lay aside every weight that does so easily beset you and let us run this race with patience that's set before us let's love the Lord Jesus Let's Be Kind to One another let's be kind to our enemies let's just love everybody no matter what they've done love them anyhow and if you can't do that brother sister you need to find an altar amen that's what the word of God says amen listen he go he goes on just building a foundation now he said but what we need tonight is a great big bundle full of the love of God poured down into our hearts amen all the differences washed away and buried out with the old years that passes let's just go now let's start a new life A New Beginning amen if you're already Born Into the kingdom of God if you already got the holy spirit in you then the only thing you have to do is cut loose from the things of the world that's holding you down amen and let us lay aside every weight and every sinly beset us that we might run with patience the life the race that is set before us amen lay aside every weight he said that's what's the matter with people today they're trying to pack up to be Christians if there's anything you need is to unpack to be a Christian listen the journey that we're going on we're not packing for it we're unpacking amen the prophet says if there's anything we need to do is unpack we got too many things hanging on now and one of them say now mother you know I I I I couldn't go along unless I could take my car table so he hangs on to the to amen and he tries to bring that on over onto the camel now amen he riding a camel see Amen in this journey he's trying to pack that with him on the camel he said because you know the other boys won't appreciate me I'm going to I'm going to go along I can't go if I can't take my car table along with me and all these other little things that keeps you see amen a little box of selfishness and you have to hang on to that too and you hang on to a little tattling and a little backbiting and a little of this and and you try to hang that on the camel and the first thing you know you jump up a stradle that old camel say come on now let's go and that old camel can hardly move he's so matched down amen so hard till he's bowlegged almost amen you're kicking and complaining about your church and amen and and and amen but you're so loaded up amen until you can't run that's what's the matter we need to unload and wash up and clean up and get right hallelujah how many believes that's the truth amen listen friends amen I believe a lot of us has come up short amen and we blamed it on the church and we blamed it on the on the preacher and we blamed it on this problem and that problem but the prophet of God said really amen what the problem is is we got too many things hanging on us that's holding us down amen that's weighing us down that's holding us back he said what we need to do is turn loose and lay aside every weight and every sin that so easily besets us and let us run Hallelujah I believe a lot of you was unpacking last night amen I believe you can run a little better today cuz you're a lot lighter amen but the thing about it is amen when you put weight off you got to keep it off come on you can talk to amen you can talk to some of these in here and I'm not going to start naming names I know better than that but amen you can talk to some that's been in that that that you know in that way and and you're trying to shed a few pounds and amen you know amen but but the but the thing about it is sometimes you can sometimes you can get rid of it amen but can you keep it off and I tell you what amen you can't do that with just having a diet every now and then you actually got to change you got to change the way you live you got to change the way you think it's got to it's got to be differeny amen it's got to be something that's continually in your amen that that that that's Amen Let me just go ahead and move on yeah he said I'm already in trouble so I know it brother Homer Lor you know he told me a long time ago he said listen brother only fat people can talk about fat people amen and he told me he said if you had a pinstriped suit it wouldn't have but one stripe but I also learned that you never quote Homer Longoria only he can say the things that he says but the problem said he said I'm laying aside every weight that so easily besets me I've got to run this race he with Pac for straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there be that find it amen there's only room for you and Jesus amen there's only room for amen listen Amen on the camel at there's only room for you and Jesus can't bring all that stuff with you amen he says in another place he said that's it just separate yourself from everything I'll have to say this look I hope it finds a resting place cuz I never thought it premeditated maybe that's the reason some of us are not getting along so well we're holding on to things that we ought to let go see it's separation see we're holding on to a little doubt or a little Wonder or a little skeptic or I wonder if it's right or could this be or could that be or how could it be he said Cut Loose this morning Hebrews 12 said lay us out every weight and sin that so easily besets the see amen what is sin sin is unbelief amen that does so easily but said and let us run Hallelujah the raceist set looking to Christ who is the author and the finisher of our faith brother Bram said there's an old proverb that's more than a proverb he said no matter H how or who is there first you have to play the rules of of the game or you'll never win if a runner is running around the track and one takes a shortcut and cuts through the field and beats the other uh by a half hour he'll still he will be disqualified see he'll be disqualified at the end of the race he's got to play it according to the rules of the game or he's disqualified and that's the way we have to do the race of life we're running now it's got to be played according to God's qualifications or we're going to lose when we get there see whether we be present or whether amen we be I'm sorry whether we be a president or a governor or minister or what church we belong to or what denomination the rules of the game has to be kept we must run it fair we must run it by the rules we must preach the word we must doing do it willingly and Paul said I believe there in Hebrews 12 that seeing we're so compassed about with such a great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and seeing that so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that is set before us Paul is speaking of the Olympics and so forth amen that was in Greece and in Rome and so he know amen that they had to play the game fair for if you did not you'd be disqualified and let me just say this tonight amen it's the same thing with you there ain't no shortcuts there ain't no bypasses amen there's only one way listen friend I believe with all my I know it ain't popular preaching more but I still believe there ain't but one way to get to heaven there's only one Lord One Faith one baptism one God above us all working in us all and there is no shortcuts hallelujah amen and if you get there and you come any other way but by the door amen then you'll be cast out is that right amen God put it in the scripture when a man climbed up and got in there some other way but he didn't have on on the right garment what did they do they took him and bound him hand and foot and cast him out he was disqualified because he didn't come God's provided way there's no shortcuts friends he says he says right uh before that previous to that he gave the great 11th chapter of Hebrews which gives a Heroes of the Faith by faith Moses by faith Abraham by faith Enoch by faith Noah all the great Heroes of the faith in saying seeing that we're so compassed about with such a great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight man here we are tonight right in the shadows of the coming of the Son of God and yet we find the church in an anemic condition we ought to be a great strong Mighty Warriors of the faith that would shake a nation God give it to us we would just receive it see amen so there's so there's little things upon us that's holding us back from running but let us lay aside all those little weights now because we're looking to the author and the finisher of our faith which is Jesus Christ who who made man on the earth amen and dwelt among was made man rather and dwelt Among Us and was made sin that through his righteousness we might be forgiven of our sins and he become us sinners that we might become his righteousness and otherwise like this he became me that I might become him he was the son of God I was a sinner but he took my place amen that I might take his place hallelujah amen why did he do that amen that he might give you the ability to run this [Music] race now now watch because brother bman the church AG book would would show that one of the uh rewards to the Overcomer would be a Crown of Life and the prophet of God took that and he ties it back with 1 Corinthians 9 which we read and Paul says know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you might obtain now watch what brother Brown said a crown given to a winner of an Olympic race was a Garland of olive branches but the crown Spoken Here in Revelation that's given to a martyr is a crown of royalty Jesus calls it the Crown of Life the crown amen the the one Crown is for those that have striven amen the other is for those that have given so in other words he's showing the reward is the same uh uh the the the same reward that's given to a martyr that actually give their life for the cause of the Gospel is given to a Believer who lives their life for the cause of the Gospel one has given their life one is living their life amen but listen friends whether you're striving or whether you're you're you're you're giving amen it makes no difference and by the way the prophet of God said it's the same Faith the same faith that was in them that give them the ability to actually lay down their life for the cause of Christ is the same Faith that's in you that gives you the ability to live your life for the cause of Christ and the reward is the same and he says it's the Crown of Life now you know we're not running for amen because watch what the prophet of God said he said he said both crowns are Incorruptible they will not perish the winners of a uh a race out here in the world will uh will will soon lose the the the joy of the Applause of the world their Glory will fail those who have given their lives for God either by daily striving for shedding their blood for a crown amen of of sacrifice amen that they will be given a Crown of Life and the crown that they are given will never will never diminish listen friends we're not running this race amen for the Applause of men we're not running to be recognized or or that our name would be great upon the Earth We're not running Amen to see who could be the greatest this is not a competition like that we're not running competing against one another Amen to see who could be the best or who could sing the best or who can preach the best amen we're not running for that kind of a crown we're running for the crown of eternal life Hallelujah you're actually running for your life and your reward is a reward of eternal life because I want to tell you amen listen you can look at look out here at Hollywood look out into the sports world Amen and they got their stars and and there and there's great athletes and there's movie stars and and their name and they're well known and but listen their beauty will fade their abilities will diminish amen and one day they'll be forgotten come on friends it's not that kind of race and it's not that kind of crown watch what the Bible says and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure to the end shall be saved Paul speaking to the Galatians the galatian church there in Galatians 5 he said you did run well but what hindered you is that right amen you did run in other words you started out good but what hindered you watch what brother Brown said in the message why I'm against organized religion he said that's exactly what happened to our Pentecostal churches they did exactly what their mother did at the beginning see they come out of people that rejected denominations and and some of you Brethren listen to this tape but some of you old men you know that years ago 40 50 years ago amen if they had talked to you about organization you You' have said it was blasphemy but today you belong to the very thing that you thought was blasphemy and you women that Bob your hair and paint your face your mother was against that amen that good old Pentecostal Saint what happened to you Paul said you did run well what hindered you see amen back there amen you was free from that stuff but but you wanted to be like the rest of them amen and and what do we see that things that used to be wrong begin to creep back into the church and the things that we used to stand against begin to creep back into the church amen and Paul amen telling the glaci of church listen you started out good but what happened you did run well but what happened what hindered you let me tell you something young people don't you let nothing hinder you in this race and don't you let nothing come between you and the word of God hallelujah amen amen listen amen the listen God is not looking for somebody to start he's looking for somebody to finish he that endures to the end now the scripture I read last night Paul said in Acts 20:24 none of these things move me neither I count my life dear to myself so that I may finish so that I may finish my course with joy one great athlete said this the will to win means nothing without the will to prepare let me tell you something you don't just wake up one morning and say I'm going going to run a marathon you'll kill yourself you you you got to train you got to build up you got to you know what they say too they say in training to run they they'll they'll tell you run as far as you can as far as you possibly can and then when you get to that point turn around and run back in other words you got to it's going to hurt you got to push yourself am me so run as far as you can and then when you get to that turn around and run back listen you got to it's going to take some training it's going to take some determination you're going to have to be persevering you're going to have to listen friends it takes determination to serve God you can't just serve God when you feel good you can't just you know uh be a Christian amen when you feel like it because I'm going to tell you there's going to be days you don't feel like it and I tell you one thing you talked to these athletes out here there's days they don't feel like going to practice there's days they don't want to go to practice there are days they don't want to go to the gym amen they they'd love to be doing other things and playing video games or whatever more amen but but listen for they got to do it when they feel like it and when they don't feel like it amen and it's not even just a uh like I said it can't be like a diet listen they they got to eat a certain way amen they got to live a certain way amen they can't eat the things they want want to eat and just do the things they want to do amen they got to eat a certain diet amen they got to uh their life has got to be uh and listen it can't be just a lifestyle I mean I know they say today you know Christianity is a lifestyle it's not a lifestyle it's not it's it's more than that it's a it's an actual literal life it's not just a lifestyle it's a literal life listen it's got to become who you are tell you something amen them people out here amen them athletes out here that's not something they do that's their identity they become that it's who they are it's all they think about and so I want to just say this when you start a race when you start a race you actually got to see yourself at the Finish Line you you got to you got to have a vision of the Finish Line before you ever start how many knows brother Brown talked about a little boy one time and he he uh they was having this competition and who could ride a bicycle across this this bridge and it was just a very narrow thing you know and and and all these boy and brother Bram said this little boy that's what brother Bram said he called him a little boy he said and and and all the other boys boys was making fun of him and all this stuff but he was watching them and they get up on the plank and they was riding their bicycle and and he said and they were looking down at the at the plank you know and as they were watching that they were trying to stay on it he said but they would go to tottering and and and and you know wavering and am because they were looking down they were looking right in front of them and they were looking at that plank and he said and they were all falling off and and this little boy he climbed up on the bicycle and he began riding that bicycle across that plank and he wrote it straight to the other side and all them other boys come and said man how'd you do that he said well I watched y'all and I watched what you were doing and I watched that you were looking down the whole time he said but I just set my eyes toward the Finish Line he said and I never looked at anything else I just looked at the finish line and he rode straight across Hallelujah let me tell you something if you're looking down you're going to go down if you're looking around you you're going to follow to the left or to the right if you're worried about your neighbor amen if you're looking at everybody else else amen listen you're going to fail but if you'll look under Jesus who is the author and the finisher of your faith look at the Finish Line I'm going to give you a a few examples just to I'm just going to give you something this morning to encourage you and so that you leave here with this camp with something in your heart going give you a few examp examples in 1986 in the New York City marathon there was almost 20,000 Runners that entered that race but what is most memorable is not who won but who finished last his name was Bob Wan he finished um 19,00 uh 430 our 413th dead last but Bob completed the New York Marathon in 4 days 2 hours and 47 minutes and 17 seconds it was unquestionably the slowest marathon in history ever but what made but what made Bob Bob W's Marathon so special was that he run with his arms 17 years before while he was in Vietnam his legs were blown went off in battle so he sat on a 15lb saddle he put leather pads on his hands and he catapulted himself that complete Marathon listen that's endurance and I'm going to ask you something what's your excuse think about it this morning think about all the reasons why we quit and give up well somebody hurt my feelings or you well you know the preacher didn't shake my hand and and and and and I didn't get to sing and you know and and we got all these reasons and you know well we we I went through a a a church split and and you just don't know the problems that I faced and and and you just listen re amen this man had his legs blowed off amen and he said but I'm not going to let that I am not going to let that be I'm not going to become a victim I'm going to be a Victor there's a there's a there's a few years ago I I I got a little farm back home and we enjoy that and and and but a few years ler I found this guy on the internet and he was called the the harmless farmer but actually he had no arms he he completely when he was just a little child he was just a I think six-year-old boy he got his both hands stuck in a in a in an augur and a graen uh card and it literally ripped his arms off his body one side he didn't even have a shoulder and his mama told his daddy he she said we're not going to treat him any different from any of our other kids could you imagine we're got we're not we're not going to treat him any he ain't got no arms we're not going to treat him any different you know what that guy you can go he he he passed away recently um he had cancer but but he lived his whole life he farmed he drove tractors he drove his own truck he put gas in his own truck he worked on equipment he hooked up implements the tractors with no arms I'm telling you he did you can go watch him he does everything with his feet he fed himself but he didn't he wasn't depending on nobody else he said I refuse Amen to to to live my life amen uh to let this me in such a way that I become a victim to it I'm not going to surrender to it I might not have arms but I got [Music] Spirit Hallelujah and listen friends there might be all kind of things and all kind of reasons and all kind of things that happened to you amen that's crippled you in some kind of way but let me tell you if you still got Spirit Hallelujah and I tell you something about this race if you keep running maybe you ain't got no leg but if you just keep running with your arms if you run long enough you'll get your legs back hallelujah amen because when we get to the end of this race we got a new body hallelujah amen amen all wrongs will be made [Applause] right that's why Paul would say I fought a good fight amen i f finished my course I kept the faith henceforth there's laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not me only but unto all them which also love is appear how many loves is appearing this morning listen friends amen I want to have the testimony at the end of the road brother Jason I want to have the testimony that Paul had I fought the good fight I might not have been the best I might not have been the greatest I might not have killed the most Devils amen but I fought a good fight I did what I could Hallelujah I never give up I never back down I never give in no matter what the opposition I kept the [Applause] faith in 1980 there was a man by the name of Bill bradhurst he hadn't R ran in any races for years since his high school days but he decided that he was going to run in the in the Pepsi challenge 10K sent in his application he wasn't sure if they'd let him in but they sent back he was he entered into the race and so he began to prepare himself trained and his major reason for wanting to run in this race was because there was a a man by the name of Bill Rogers that was a nationally known Runner and he was also competing in that challenge and and and and this this gentleman uh Bill broadhurst had looked up to him and admired him and he wanted to run beside him the reason why he hadn't run a race in all them years is because when he was in the prime of his life he had suffered an aneurysm that caused the doctors a question if he had ever even walk and they they they let let alone run but he continually took on the impossible and met the challenge and eventually he did learn to walk but as as he walked he always was dragging one foot he could step with one and drag the other step with one and drag the other and that's the way he walked and that's also the way he run and so he went and he entered the race and when they started the race for the first few moments he run with the rest of the runners and and for a little while he could see them in the distance but after a while they went clean out of his sight and then after a while he be to hear their footsteps as they coming back behind him they were actually lapping him and they and they run by him again and and and so they had finished the race and for a little while you know some of the people stood along the roads as they do and and cheered him on but after a while you know they had things to do and places to go and people begin to disperse and even the police officers tried to stay for a while to block the traffic and so forth but after a while they had to go back to their jobs and they removed all the markers and and they even said that after a little while as he was running down the the the the the track or the the road there the marathon the path that they had said and dragging his leg the children begin to come out and make fun of him and taau him and and and and and ridicule him and but he just kept phone running and listen there was nobody around it it got to a place that he said that he felt like he had become the Forgotten man and there was nobody there to witness this achievement there was nobody there to to you know uh uh to cheer him on or or or anything like that he was just running all by himself but with sheer determination he said I'm going to finish this race don't matter if nobody else sees I'm going to finish this race and he just kept on running and he got close to that finish line and when he did what what he didn't know was that all the runners that had been a part of that race including uh Bill Rogers that had actually won the race had had hid themselves in the alleys right at the finish line and right about the time brother Jason that he was getting ready to cross that finish line they come pouring out of the alleys and they begin cheering him amen and they lifted him up Amen on their shoulders and carried him and Bill Rogers which had won the the the race amen took the prize and and put it over his neck and he said today you're the real winner of this race and when I read that story I got to thinking about I thought sometimes amen we're ridiculed made fun of we feel like that we're forgotten and we feel like we're all by ourselves amen and we feel like we're running all alone but there's a great cloud of witnesses and when we get to the Finish Line hallelujah amen they're going to step over there's going to be such a blending of Dimensions that they're going to come in and we're going to see them and we're going to hear their cheers Hallelujah whether you know it or not this morning amen they are cheering for you right now they're saying press on run don't stop Hallelujah somebody has got to finish it somebody it's got to go to perfection oh my there was a man several years ago a Chinese gentleman they invited him to a the Chinese government actually put together a ceremony invited this gentleman and gave him a great honor he was a competitor in the 1968 Olympic marathon in Mexico and he actually was a last place finisher you think why in the world would the Chinese government invite a 70y old man who finished dead last in the Olympics and give him a great honor what was because of this is because when he started running that Marathon there in Mexico in 1968 early on in the journey he stumbled and fell and injured himself immediately he was out of the Runnings he was he was no longer a competitor there was no way he was going to finish in any position he was not going to receive any medals he immediately it was as soon as he fell and injured himself it was over but he got up and he continued on and he just kept on and he limped his way AC AC cross that finish line and a reporter come to him and asked him he said we don't understand he said we why did you do this why did you there was no hope of you even placing or there was no hope why did you do why' you continue on why' you keep running he said what you don't understand is this is not about me and my accomplishments I am here representing a nation and he said my nation did not send me to these games to start a race they sent me here to finish a race let me tell you something this morning this ain't about me and this ain't about you and this is not about our accomplishments as I said already this is not who's the greatest Among Us and who's the best amen listen friends amen we are here representing a kingdom we are here representing Hallelujah and God did not send us a in here to start a race he he sent us here to finish a race and we may fall down and we may get injured but what are we going to do listen for every Soldier falls down amen you're going to fall down you're going to have failures you're going to have disappointments you're going to make mistakes but what are you going to do are you going to lay there and wallow in it or are you going to get up Hallelujah and press on listen re amen we're going to fall but we're not going to stay down Hallelujah and we're not going to lay in and we're not looking for [Music] sympathy hallelujah we're going to get up got a purpose in your heart I'm going to just share a couple more stories with you just encouragement there's a little girl her name was Wilma she was born prematurely this produced complications that resulting in her con uh uh she got double pneumonia twice scarlet fever but the worst was that she had a really bad bout with polio which left her with a crooked leg and a twisted foot she had to wear metal metal braces she got stars from the neighborhood kids six years of bus rides to Nashville for treatments could have driven her to could have she could have took that and went into a a shell she could have you know just give into it but she refused she was determined not to allow her disability to get in the way of her dreams maybe maybe her determination was generated by uh the faith of her mother who often said honey the most important thing in life is that for you to believe and keep on trying by age 11 she decided that through sheer determination and a spirit to persevere regardless of the circumstance she for for herself to learn how to walk without braces by age 12 she had made a wonderful discovery that she could run and jump and play ball her older sister was quite a good basketball player so she decided to challenge her on the court she began to improve the two of them uh ultimately went out for the same school team her sister made the final 12 but Wilma didn't however because her father would allow uh would would allow her sister to travel with the team or she he wouldn't rather allow her to travel alone without her sister uh as a chaperon Wilma found herself often in the presence of the coach one day she built up enough nerve to confront the man and she she blurred it out to him she said if you'll give me 10 minutes of your time every day in only 10 minutes I'll give you a world class athlete he took her up on it shortly thereafter I'm I'm sorry um the result is history she finally won a starting position on the basketball squad and then in the second SE season she decide to try out for the track team what a decision in her first race she beat her girlfriend then she beat all the girls in her school then every high school girl in the state of Tennessee Wilman was only 14 but already a champion shortly thereafter although still in high school she in she was invited to join the uh uh uh the tiger bills track team at the ten Tennessee State University she began a a series uh I'm sorry a serious training program after school and on weekends and she improved and continued to win in short dashes in the 440 yard relay and two years later she was invited to try out for the Olympics she qualified and ran in the 1956 games she won a bronze medal on on as her team placed third in the 4 40 meter relay it was a bit Bittersweet Victory she had won but she decided that next time she was going to win gold and that's exactly what she did and this is a girl that was walking in leg braces this is a girl that had a a a twisted foot and and all these things but she was

in this relay it was a they run with a torch it's actually the you know they you you see them light the torch at the Olympics and so forth but they run this race with a torch and this race had very little to do with speed um or who was the fast because it had to be in imperfect timing because they could never the the the the winner of the race was not who crossed the Finish Line first it's the one that crossed with a torch still lit all right and they could never put it down it was really it was a relay so they had to hand it off one to the next they could never set it down and it could never go out and so they would run they would put all kind of obstacles in their way so they had to navigate the obstacles and they had to do it with their torch still lit fire could never go out let me tell you something friends I'm tell you we ain't just going to finish this race we're going to finish it with a fire burning listen to me young people amen we're not going to amen we're not just going to get just barely make it we're not just going to just you know slide into heaven the skin of our teeth just barely make it a bunch of beat down amen discouraged head hung over no we're going

going to leave this camp and say I refuse to let the fire that's burning in my heart in this Camp I will not let it I will not let it be distinguished Hallelujah and they said they had to run with Integrity they had to run with the torch lifted high they couldn't be ashamed come on friends you ain't got nothing to be ashamed of let me tell you young people something this you young men that look like men and dressed like men you ain't got nothing to be ashamed of you young girls with your long hair and your modest apparel you ain't got nothing to be ashamed of wear it as a crown Hallelujah I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ it is the power of God under salvation I ain't ashamed of the message of this hour I am not ashamed to be identified with a prophet in the end time and the message that he pray I'm not ashamed of Holiness I listen to I listen to Young Ladies come up in a prayer line and they stand and they say I don't feel worthy I don't feel good enough and I don't feel like I'll ever fit in or except listen you're you're you're trying to fit in the wrong place and you're looking in the mirror and and you say I'm I'm not beautiful I can't compare I can't compare with the with the beauty of the of the world you're looking in the wrong mirror God gave you a [Applause] mirror let me tell every one of you something God gave you a mirror it's a mirror of his word and I tell you what you young girls amen serving God in the beauty of Holiness look in the mirror of God's word and what you'll see looking back at you is something beautiful and special and all the beauty queens in Hollywood can never compare with a beauty amen of of a of a young person a young lady or a young man that ser serving God in the beauty of Holiness you ain't got nothing to be ashamed of and

clap of Praise we are not ashamed We Are The Blood Bought Holy Ghost filled saved satified Hallelujah devil stomping Overcomers of the last age Hallelujah we ain't got nothing to be ashamed of we're not backing down we're not giving up we're press s on run let me tell you something about a a relay a relay first of all if you're if you had a relay team you start out with your with a strong Runner and you end with a strong Runner now now listen that's not to diminish or take away from the importance of every runner in between they had to keep the pace they had to stay steady they had to play their part but a good coach will recognize the strengths and he wants to start out with the strongest he wants to end with the strongest and God started this race the same way he he started out with the alpha Church on the day of Pentecost with the power of the Holy Ghost with the original word with original Faith Hallelujah and he's going to end it with a bride the Omega bride restored back listen brother when brother BR saw the preview of the Bride he said the last one looked exactly like the first one Hallelujah and he started it out with a prophet and ends it with a prophet he started out with the unadulterated word and he ends it with the unadulterated word and you got the original Faith with the original Holy Ghost with the original Power but in that relay listen as they would run they didn't they didn't wait brother Jason and I'm I am closing eventually but they didn't they didn't you know it wasn't like a guy was standing here and and a guy you know he's running the the the runner is running towards him he didn't just stand there and wait till he got there and then now he's going to stop and hand the Baton to the next man and he's going to start no there there would there was there would be a blending because when he's standing here when he sees that guy approaching he starts running right then and he runs until he gets the pace until his steps is matching the other Runner steps and when they get in Perfect Harmony then they pass the Baton the other guys finished his race let me just tell you amen that those that run before us they run it well they finished their race but somebody's got to get in step with the word some of you's got to get in step with the word because this is your time listen it's your turn Hallelujah this is your turn the Baton is in your hand what are you going to do with it Hallelujah listen listen to me young people this message is given to you what are you going to do with it brother bam said every generation has to have its own Revival a fresh chance at the word amen and I'm telling you I'm challenging you this morning amen as I'm closing that I'm challenging you amen amen the Baton is in your hands amen what are you going to do how are you going to run is there anybody in there amen that would like to join me and say Brother John I'm going to give it everything I got Hallelujah I'm going to run with everything that's within me and I refuse Amen to give up or to give in or to look around me I will not be distracted Hallelujah I will not be moved I will not be deterred I will [Applause] run Hallelujah listen Brother s we got to finish it we got to finish this race they are depending on us because they without us cannot be made perfect I'm going to close I'm going to give you one more story and I'm closing some of you may have seen this that you can actually watch watch a video of This I Believe on YouTube or I actually never seen it but I think somebody told me you could and it happened there in the 1992 Olympics that seems like a long time ago to y'all don't it but it was in Barcelona and what happened there was one of the most me memorable Moments in Sports history because there was a young man and he went to these Olympics he was he was actually uh um you know he was um uh he was favored to to place and to win a medal and he was a great Runner he he had the abilities so forth as he started that race his name was Derek Redmond as he started that race he he got off to a great start he was running race of his life a Finish Line was right in sight and suddenly he felt a stab of pain in his right leg he fell face first to the track the race was over the race was over for him but he struggled to his feet the medical team or I'm sorry before the medical team could even reach him he had already started running he had already started moving towards the finish line and though every Runner had passed him he began hopping forward tears of pain running down his face but he was determined to finish that race suddenly a man come out of the sidelines play the security he ran out on the track and he reached over and he took that young man in his arms he put his arms around him what they didn't know a lot of them was that was his daddy he whispered in that boy's ear he said son it's going to be all right let's finish the race [Applause] together I'm I'm closing leaving you with this you are not by yourself and you may fall down but I tell you what we got a heavenly father and if he has to carry me across the Finish Line brother Jason I'm going to make it because he said I'm going to make it and he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you and we are not running alone amen he's running with us hallelujah listen friends amen feel the tender hand of Jehovah this morning when you're weak he's strong and his strength is made perfect in our weakness we can't do it by oursel but greater is he that is within us than he that is in the world let's stand our feet this morning Hallelujah let us run hallelujah how many's going to leave this Camp without determination burning in your heart let us run run the race with patience that's been set before us hallelujah God bless you we love you Amen in Jesus name God bless you I um I hardly have the voice for this but Matt and I were discussing the plan was to have him come up but that sermon touched my heart so deeply for very personal reasons you got a little time for One More Story I used to run track and field back in the day seemed like many moons ago and I was a distance Runner and I could I my practice I sessions was a threemile run that I could run in under 16 minutes and um they didn't have too many of those kinds of races in the school where I went so I was stuck running 440s and 880s and things like that and I ran those relays that brother Josh was talking about and you had to I'm going to tell you something about that relay you had to trust The Man Behind you because you really you really weren't trying to watch him you were trusting him and as you're reaching back you're you're believing you take one glance and then you go here he comes and you're trying to sink up and you're trusting that he ain't going to faint he ain't going to fall he's going to get that baton in your hand and you're just waiting for it I going to tell you something friends we got to have that kind of confidence in one another globally around the world we got to have that kind of confidence in one another and I remember that when I would when I would train I had this this habit of not really uh not really running to my utmost and and and we would be in the practice sessions and it affected at at time when we would have tournaments and everything and it would affect you know because uh you know there was just a something where I just said wow wow I I should have pressed harder I should have pressed harder and and and I'd win some and I'd lose some and but you know many times I I lost a race that I didn't win that I could have and I I was a better Runner than the person who ran across ahead of me but here's one thing that I could say I never quit a race I never quit one and I and I remember one time I came in and we were in our practice session and here I come and I had this thing where I would just kind of Move Along at my regular Pace during the during the three mile practice but when I'd make the last turn and I could see the Finish Line man I would turn on the Jets and I would run and it felt like like I was floating on air and I would just streak ahead of everybody and I would be so jubilent when I got across Finish Line and I would just say wow that was so wonderful and the coach would come up behind me and put a boot on my rear end and kick me say they used they used to do that in school y'all don't know nothing y trust me and he would literally give me a boom I'd say what was that for and he' say where was all of that gusto in the in the first two and three quarters of that you know where where why were you just Lolly gagging along if you can cross the finish line with that kind of energy then you you wasted a you got a lot of energy left and you didn't put it out there on the track and you know that bothered me and I went home and I thought about that and it bothered me and and we came up to the next track meet and I remember it so clear it was the it was the last time I was in an official School event and I wanted to do well and there were large crowds and and I and it and it was a longdistance run I forget Maybe I don't remember maybe seemed like it was a mile maybe I don't remember clearly might have been 880 yards but it wasn't a relay and I just started running and the whole pack I just remember watching the pack kind of just pull away from me and I was okay with that I said it's okay and and I I I finished that race and you know whoever won first second and third and they got Blue Ribbon red ribbon and a yellow ribbon or whatever like that and I didn't get anything and I want to tell you something that caused something that happened to me that I carried for years I still fight against it to this day it's a complex and the complex is this that I always feel like no matter what I'm doing no matter how much I do a a I'm constantly preaching I'm constantly teaching I'm constantly on Bible studies I'm traveled the world s six six continents out of seven preaching the message of the hour 42 different countries but I always have this sense of I'm underachieving I'm underachieving and it causes me to push and push and push because I'm underachieving and one day I was just talking to the Lord and I said Lord I'm so sorry that I'm always an underachiever and and and I don't know why I don't press harder and I I want to press it's in me to press where's my disciplined depressed is anybody have that kind of a struggle you say I I I could have should have would have why didn't I and I just thought to myself and I just it was such a burden and not so long ago the Lord came to me and I was just crying the same old cry the same old prayer boohoo over it and and the Lord the Lord just said you know you remember that race and he took me back all those years to a boy and and we and and I thought about all the people of all the races that I had run and people dropped out and dropped out and couldn't finish and couldn't finish and the Lord reminded me he said you know you did finish that race cuz I'd forgot that I had literally gotten so narrowly minded to my performance that I completely forgot I finished the race and a lot of people didn't and I'm telling you something here I am today and I've been raised up in this message and I've been running it a long time and there have been others who were better Runners than me who ran ahead of me who have now dropped out and went on the sidelines and left the race field and went on about their life but I'm still running hallelujah hallelujah and I'm going to finish it I'm not going to quit I'm going to finish fin this race I might not be the fastest but I'm going to finish it and God is challenging you today don't get held back by your failures or by your weakness God is looking for you to finish it there's going to be somebody finish this race I saw that video brother Josh was talking about I was going to tell you that story had he not told it and you know the thing that me brother Josh that stood out to me thank you for not mentioning it was when that father jumped over he broke all the rules he didn't care that was his boy he didn't care about man's rules or or regulations or put put him in a box that was his son this was his daddy and he jumped the rail and he ran out on the track and the you do you know why do you know why this security tried to stop him and he just barreled right through him they tried to stop him cuz they didn't know who he was I know the world don't know who my daddy is all the time I know they don't recognize God in flesh I I know they don't recognize the word that I follow but I'm here to tell you there was not enough demons there's not enough power to keep your father from running by your side I want you to know today you're not alone you're Heavenly Father father is saying come on you can run it you can finish it I want to finish it on that other side it's not going to matter who was greater who did this that or the other I'm going to tell you something when we reach that greatest Youth Camp of all the ages and we gather around father's Throne oh you're going to be so glad you ran you're going to be so glad you didn't quit you're going to going to be so glad God loved you you're going to be so glad you believed [Applause] him oh I wish I wish I had the voice to preach but it' probably keep you here another hour we're not going to do it I want to sing this song Because He Lives I Can Face Tomorrow not because I'm great but because he lives all fear is gone because I don't wonder I don't think I don't imagine I know because I know he holds listen let me tell you something a lot of times things happen we get disturbed by it could I suggest to you today that you don't waste a whole lot of time you know you say well I got here's a here's a terrible situation here's something that happened like we got to have a plan we got to do something about it you you know don't waste too much time planning for something God already planned for or trying to figure out what to do when he already knows what to do why don't you just give it to him and say Lord I I can't fix this problem I'm just going to give it to you and I'm going to keep running I'm going to let you handle it you already knew about it I'm just going to keep on running not going to get distracted cuz I can't make it on my own anyhow but with you at my side di I am an invincible Army do you believe that today I'm going to let brother Matt Come and sing this I definitely don't have the voice for that but because he lives I want you to leave here today and say Because He Lives I Can Face tomorrow because he lives all fear is gone let it go let it be gone because I know he holds my future and you
