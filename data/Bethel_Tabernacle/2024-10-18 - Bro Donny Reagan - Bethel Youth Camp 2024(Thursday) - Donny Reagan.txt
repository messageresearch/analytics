========================================

[Music] we on here no are we on now we are on now amen always getting started there's a little bit of this and a little bit of that and a whole lot of the other thing going on so welcome to bethl Youth Camp 2024 may God richly bless you we trust that this will be a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit and that it'll visit each one of you in a very specific and very special way uh the fact that we're here I believe is ordained of God we know that's true regardless regardless of the circumstances but this year we can say it's a miracle that we're having camp um the camp is still standing power is on now and the roads are we're ready for all of us to get here so we know know the Lord has a a special purpose for each one of us during this camp and I believe that each one of us are uh expecting and anticipating this is I believe our fourth year of the camp and we've seen the Lord there's many miracles sitting amongst us us that many testimonies that have come from this camp and we're so thankful to the Lord Jesus for that um want to start off the service with a little camper orientation I'm Jason dears I'm the co-director of Camp somewhere on camp site is brother Matt Watkins he's the director of Camp and of course our pastor is brother Jason Watkins which will come out and do a few announcements and introductions um after I'm finished I want to make sure everyone is kind of aware of the schedule aware of the basic requirements that we have um first of all we want everyone to be safe uh we want everyone to have a Godly and enjoyable experience want to make sure you're comfortable if you have a need please let your counselors know right away don't delay on it don't be nervous a voice voice anything that you feel like you need to to your counselor they're there to serve you to love you and to pray for you just want to start with Ser you're here for service right not just Fellowship not just meeting people service is mandatory every night you can't hang out in your cabin or in chairs outside while service is going on please be sure to use the restroom before service starts so there isn't a big Interruption when it's time to change the order of the service usually it will happen and sometimes there's big groups of 30 people get up at once let's make sure not to do that use the restroom before you come in here I'm pretty sure unless there's a medical issue we can all uh make it through unless it's one of those services that goes to midnight or 2 a.m. and we understand but with that said if if there is an issue that you have please make sure that your counselor is aware of it let if if there's if there's something that happens while service is going on B I don't see him anywhere but you'll usually see brother Brad y in the back he's our lead Deacon please let him know if there's an issue you're having so we can track down um someone to help you um if you have a medical issue please make sure you speak to your counselor about it and then they'll get in touch with our medical team also each morning there's Breakfast at 8:30 uh and immediately following that's on Friday and Saturday immediately following break breakfast there'll be a teaching service so you don't have to come here it'll be right there in gold bricks where you're where you're eating so don't get up and leave after you're done eating breakfast stay there there'll be a teaching session with brother Diggs kri Diggs or brother Jason Watkins um and those sessions are mandatory we won't let you leave um and if you need to use the restroom there's restrooms at at the um cafeteria gold bricks um there there will not be any devotion by the campfire after service this year there'll be free time with concessions until about 11:30 p.m. and when you'll need to be back in your room so the time is free after service you're welcome to go right to bed if you feel like you need to otherwise Main Street and the chairs all around Camp are open for Fellowship there will be a small bonfire on the other side of the lake here and of course concessions is open um now I want to just read through our camp rules and regulations so that everybody understands the standards so we operate our camp with clear expectations and clear consequences if rules are violated our counselor or security team team lead will issue a warning second violation is calling your parents and having them take you home uh this will be done obviously together with our leadership team we don't take that lightly we don't want want to do that but we reserve the right to do that if there's any violations that are egregious um some of them will be detailed uh below um obviously your parents expect us to provide you a safe and edifying atmosphere so number one boys are not allowed in the girls dorms and vice versa this can result in immediate expulsion both boys and girls are required to dress modestly at all times I won't go through all the details but we believe in what the prophet of God Tau hot us and we want to provide a good Godly environment for everyone it's not allowed to leave your cabin before rise and shine believe is at 7:30 and it's also not allowed to leave your cabin after the lights out if you do that you can be possibly be sent home immediately um number four extreme practical jokes and cabin raids are not allowed it also can result in immediate exposion there's no cursing fighting pushing punching bullying or other inappropriate behavior which could result again in media exposion it's not allowed to watch movies or televis television shows on apps in the cabins when it's time for lights out put your phone away and go to sleep uh hiking trails are closed completely due to the storm damage campers are not allowed to leave the camp once they have checked in unless they have prior approval check with your counselor and your check counselor will check with their team lead and those who have driven need to leave their cars in place once they Park them unless they have prior approval from their counselor all campers have to be in their cabins after lights out no headphones or airpods of any kind are allowed during the day and again Camp directors do reserve the right to send home any campers if in their judgment they've violated Camp rules and in those cases refunds will not be given some final reminders there's a skit practice tomorrow at 11:00 am and we'll try to keep these updates going through so you see them here and also uh over in gold bricks and they'll be updated each service and each meal so there's a skit practice if you've already signed up for that you know who you are be here you should have already had one practice today and there'll be another one tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. if you signed up to sing a special look for your time slot over uh in front of the concession it'll be put up on the door there every morning choir practice on Friday will be at 2:30 p.m and 3:30 p.m on Saturday lost and found is in the concessions area we've already had something lost if you lost something it's probably in concessions go check it out once again our desire is for you to make new friends see old

here's my cup Grant it Lord Jesus and make me whole Hallelujah aren we glad tonight to know that our father knows every need that every one of us have no doubt our needs here in this place tonight are so different some of you from different states different regions of the country maybe you're facing different types of battles but the Lord Jesus I believe is ordained these times for us to be together and he knows every one of your needs some some of you might need something in your soul some of you in your spirit some of you in your body maybe some of you all three but he's mindful we're going to pray and as we do can we just hold our needs and our request at this Opening Service as we go to the Lord in prayer whatever your need is right now Heavenly Father we count it's such a great honor that we can stand before a great group of young people father young people that have been called out of the world called out of sin called out of religion called into the Gospel of Jesus Christ we're thankful father for this evening light that has come in this day to shine upon the seed to bring us into this great hour Lord as we start these few days of meetings we pray for your your leadership your divine intervention you're the only one that can custom fit a sermon that'll be able to touch every Hungry Heart Tonight There's no way any man could do that on his own so we commit the service to you Lord I pray that you would lead me in a way that would please you for this Opening Service father if there's a need here tonight that lays outside the confin of the way that I've studied that I pray you'd make me sensitive Lord maybe someone that would go back and hear the service or maybe a young lady a young man it may not take but a sentence or two and it'll be their answer so help me Jesus it's more than a preacher getting scriptures and quotes together it's being led of the Holy Ghost come tonight father we commit the service we commit the preaching of the word and the hearers all these Services all the efforts brother Jason and his church all those that have put forth would you bless it dear God May those things of Eternal value come out of these days that we are together in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen praise the Lord if you would turn with me tonight to Isaiah chapter 59 verse 15 we greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus we count it a great honor to be able to be with you all uh I was supposed to be here last year but as probably many of you know the Lord and his wisdom decided to take my daughter Erica home and I'm sure probably a lot of you prayed for her and we thank you for that it was actually a year ago yesterday um so we're happy she's not sick anymore happy that she's the Lord we thought the Lord was going to heal her and in her body and take away that cancer that she had fought for about 4 years but the Lord's plan was to heal her of her mortality not just heal her temporarily so we're looking every day to be able to be gathered together of course not only with her but with Jesus first of all and all of our loved ones Isaiah chapter 59 verse um 15 I want to say what an honor it is for me to be able to preach the with u brother Andrew Glover um I remember from Brother Andrew was a little bitty boy about that big and uh went to our church long time ago that's right and uh it sent me a picture some time ago it was of him coming up for prayer and he always liked to come up for prayer he like to come up to the Altar and little bitty old guy and sit on the front row and I look at him today and what he's grown up into a fine fine man of God and what God's done through room it just makes makes you so happy and if the Lord terries before long I'm 68 years old and brother Jason of course is not that old but he's getting closer and these other brothers we're getting we're getting older and if the Lord terries who's going to take this message used to I could fulfill that quote that brother renom said that these young men will take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord Jesus guess what I can't fulfill that that quote anymore so the Lord has got maybe young men here tonight maybe future Pastor wives evangelist wives so we're not just looking to you tonight as being the Church of tomorrow but you're the Church of today so you never know what God's allowing you to go through in the young years of your life don't think that well whenever I get 25 30 35 whatever God may be allowing you to go through things this very week that will help mold you for the years are to come amen let's read together Isaiah chapter 59:1 15 ye truth fath and he that departeth from Evil maketh himself a prey and the Lord saw it that this peculiar that truth at this time frame where they were it seemed it was failing and those that were departing from Evil it seemed as if though they were making themsel a pray and the Lord saw it sounds a lot like to they we're living doesn't it and it displeased him that there was no judgment and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and en helmet of salvation upon his head and put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a cloak according to their deeds accordingly he will repay Fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense now this is the verse we want to take from tonight so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard a standard against him may the Lord bless his words you may be seated thank you I'd like to speak to you for just a little a little short time tonight on the standard of the Lord I'm sure that most of you know what a standard is we don't use them as much of of course in our day as they did whenever it was written in the Old Testament but we see enough of them to be able to know that it is an identification so if you're in the Army in the Marines in the Navy whatever you are you have a certain Banner a certain identification a standard is something that helps us gives us a rallying point that we can be able to know uh where to go where we are assigned to it is our identification status now God has always had that and if God has a standard then we know that Satan's goal will be to try to confuse the people of God for that day to where they're not certain where their standard is now because we're not a denomination if we would um list denominational names tonight and values of those people and we're not here now to you know to discredit anyone for wherever they're walking and what God has given them but for many of them they would declare a certain name and you'd say oh yes that that's me that that's what I am I'm of this certain name well that becomes a standard as it was for those people and then they rally around that and whatever that standard declares by their board of directors or their trustees or their people on their system then they get together and they say Well since we are this certain certain group this is what we believe this is our Declaration of faith we believe in God Almighty we believe in this and that and the other then their people they will rally around that that will become the standard by which they gather themselves then other people say well no no no I I don't want to be a part of that because I I believe you know you got to be baptized and that they simply believe in sprinkling so they declare their Declaration of what their standard is and we realize that Satan does this to be to bring confusion upon the people now I love the way that Isaiah when he wrote this by the inspiration of the spirit of God and he said whenever the enemy shall come in like a flood that the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him now you know according we've just come through a terrible terrible time and this uh hurricane that come up through and wasn't even sure if it's was going to be able to have this Camp because of the effect of it now I didn't see so much on my journey here today uh once I reached this part of that of the flooding but what I saw more so here was trees but our church is about 10 miles from where we had massive catastrophic flooding it was a Thousand-Year flood and it was about about 10 miles from our church and uh bridge is washed away the Interstate closed down hous is washed away some of the people from our church stood at the place where they worked and they saw houses washing down the river they saw churches washing down the river people cars animals uh everything that you can imagine and Carol and I my wife came through uh the a little detour on the interstate today and whenever we cross that place and we saw what had happened it was absolutely unimaginable a catastrophic Flood now you know a flood it's strange because a flood can come in many ways sometimes a flood can be a catastrophic flood as the one that came through Helen now what made it so bad for East Tennessee and Western North Carolina was because it had been many days of of pretty heavy rain and then whenever the flood itself came with the wind and all of that and all the inches and inches of rain then it brought more flooding on top of the wet ground now what had already happened was the inches and inches of rain that had fallen in Western North Carolina and in East Tennessee it caused the ground the mountains to begin to loosen up and then whenever more rain was brought by helim then what it did was it caused tremendous landslides and then trees start falling off of the mountains and sliding down and it's it's absolutely un unfathomable the amount of trees and the amount of debris and the Mount of of great big gigantic M Boulders that are half as big as this building where we are tonight that have been displaced by the power of water but now I want you to think that all floods don't come the way that Helen did you see sometimes floods are brought about by just moderate rainfall that will come day after day after day and it's not a deou of rain it's not something to where you're getting a warning from your National Weather Service and your phone goes off okay we're expecting about seven Ines of rain today and maybe another five and a few more days but it's just moderate rain and it just comes down and you know it's not really that scary it's not that frightening and it happens one day and then another day and then another day and another day it's all moderate rain and then all of a sudden this this pressure will move in and the system will begin to form and it's called by this trough which is in the sky and this trough will just get enough moisture from the Gulf or from the West as it's moving across here and it will just become a deluge now you know I myself I see that as a parallel to where that that's the way life is that sometimes it's not like that we get these heavy deuses in our life but it might be a moderate trial with another moderate trial and another moderate trial and then we find ourselves in a dilemma and what is it it's still a flood nonetheless now no doubt most of you if you've been serving the lord very long you've had floods as it was with helim to where that it seemed like you were overwhelmed so suddenly and it caught you unawares now for those of you that have seen YouTube videos and and one of the towns there near where we live in Johnson City was called Irwin and uh it was a great river that came down through there many years ago uh the core of engineers came behind uh where the hospital was and they built a great restraint they felt like that would be able to hold it in case a flood came but what the water did was the river in the middle of this flood actually changed its course so the core of engineers prepared this so that the river would run its course and it would be behind this certain Hospital which is unicy county hospital one of the sisters in our church a Deacon's wife wife was the administrator of that hospital so she was in Johnson City when she gets this alarm this notice that the river has changed its course and instead of going behind the hospital it's coming in front of the hospital so instead of running for safety this sister goes back to the hospital in the face of danger why she's an administrator it's her responsibility so the water is ing they're taking the patience out for those who know who could not climb on the top of the roof they put them in hospital and they were rising and rising and Rising this sister call my wife and I on the phone she's on the roof of this Hospital cars are passing by she saw her car going by she saw buildings going by different things going by her some of the EMT people are up there the sheriff is up there with them and they cannot get a helicopter in there because the winds hurricane is still blowing trees are going down through there she calls her husband and tells him goodbye and she wanted to hear my voice and my wife Carol's voice thinking it might be the last time she'll ever hear it I can't imagine the human Fear Can you now if you've seen any of these videos there's a lot of them on YouTube and there's a Blackhawk helicopter that comes in and picks her up she's the last one on the roof well let me tell you something maybe you feel that way tonight you've been under such stress and strain in your family and your home maybe your church is having all kinds of issues and you're not sure that you're going to pull through this one I'm not here tonight to tell you to look for a Blackhawk helicopter but I'm here tonight to tell you the Lord Jesus has come in these meetings not with the Blackhawk helicopter but on the wings of an eagle hallelujah hallelujah we begin to pray brother Joe Hara he's the brother that was his wife there and he's a minister from the church and also a deacon and he text Brother Daryl and myself and a couple of more ministers and said please pray I feel so helpless I can't do a thing they had all kinds of boats and things that was there but they couldn't get to them because the water was Rising so fast and it got was just in a few feet of the boundary of the roof line when the sister called Carol and I and she said please pray please pray we got patience in boats we've got patience up on the top of the roof and it don't look like they're going to be able to save us please pray so we begin to pray and our God and his power caused that wind to calm down around that hospital and they begin to send in one helicopter after another and be able to bring out those people let me tell you something that same God that calmed that wind so they could be able to make an emergency landing is right here in this building tonight to be able to drop down whatever you have need of in your life we know that floods can be so I I've been our our church has been helping a lot of these things and the way it happened to us it's it's just phenomenal one of the brothers in our church got a phone call from someone who worked with over in Weaverville North of Asheville and he was blocked in by trees and couldn't get out he said could you come maybe and bring a friend and bring a chainsaw and help get us out we have no power no water so they left our Church Fellowship Paul maybe four or five bags of groceries couple of chainsaws gas whatever and then the next day some more begin to cry and some more begin to cry we have fixed over 1,300 meals our sisters did tens of thousands of dollars have been sent to us from people all over the United States people from 13 states have drove tractors trailers you Halls all types of things why because it touched their heart the flood victims lost everything I've been on some of those deliveries myself and see how devastating as is and as I looked in those mountains and I told my wife when I come home I said what I saw today those scars of those what the damage that was done in those mountains and in the rivers and so on will be there until the breaking of the day of the Millennium it will never recover In Our Lifetime trees that were a hundred years old some of them even older than that broke like toothpicks homes displaced lives displaced but I look tonight and I look at humanity and I wonder how many people's lives look way worse than the mountains that I've seen these poor people and you take them water and you take them food and Pringles and Cheerios they don't have a toothbrush they don't have a comb to comb their hair it's getting cold in the mountains they don't have a coat but I think tonight maybe some of you you've come to this meeting and you thought I'm not sure if it's even for me I don't know if I can get anything or not I believe you can Hallelujah brother Andrew and myself come tonight to be a part of the relief disaster team praise the Lord hallelujah amen whenever the enemy comes in it's like he comes in a way that we're not quite prepared there's no way that the people who would have lost everything would have ever stayed the sister in our church no doubt if she could have went back and rethought she' probably saying what am I doing why why would I even do that but it was a pulsation of the moment because she loved her patience and she couldn't stand to see them that were invalid and even after she got back back and and was safe and rescued herself even that afternoon and that night and the next day she was calling and checking on those patients also another brother from our church was also on top of that you know why because they don't do it for a salary they do it because they're called to do it and let me just tell you the reason that brother Jason and their church and all the those that have worked behind the scenes why they do that they don't do this so they can get a name so people can say well praise God brother Jason Watkins and brother Jason dear oh my those guys are great guys they're not doing it for that more than likely they don't even care if you remember their first middle or last name as long as your life gets changed that's the most important thing to them and they do it because they love you and they pray and ask God about the ministry to get in here brother Andrew and myself we not here for any other reason it's it's really difficult for me to leave because my daughter and all that my my granddaughter's been you know at home and so on and we've got all this disaster stuff we've turned our fellowship hall into a place I mean it's absolutely unbelievable it looks like a miniature of Walmart we've got Pringles you need anything we got it pretty much anything you need we've got it there more supplies coming in and seven more truckloads going out today generators gasoline propane some of these peoples have no heaters we bought 500 from Walmart walart waiting for them to come we bought them from True Value Hardware coming from absolutely everywhere it's a miracle what it has done to our church it has brought our church together you know what we couldn't have done it I I've come in on Saturday and saw how it was all operating and I told the church on Sunday I se after I saw how this was working I come to this conclusion you all don't even need me no more I'm retiring I wish but you know what God calls us and he may work on us for years to get us ready for such a time as this and let me encourage you tonight young man young woman let me just give you a little insight or you say well I've got plenty of years to be able to you know just not really give that commitment to God you don't even know that at all I'm a 68 year old man and I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus when I was 12 I started preaching when I was 18 50 years of my life ask me tonight anybody want to do I regret giving up my 10 years for Jesus I don't I met my lovely wife when I was 16 she was 16 born on the same day we got married July the 8th we were 16 we turned 17 on July the 9th I'm not telling you to do that and we've been together all these years and we still love one another thank the Lord for that I'm so grateful for it I do not regret giving God my 10 years I don't regret giving God my 20s my 30s my 40s my 50s and well up into my 60s and if he terries and I'm alive I'm going to give him my 70s and my 80s and my 90s if I'm alive don't you think well I I've got a lot to do I'll tell you what you've got to do you need to read your Bible you need to listen to the message of the hour you need to go to youth meetings and not only that but get your soul set on fire by the Holy Ghost and when you come back from those youth meetings or you say my church needs a Revival who knows might start with you or with you or with you it might be through you that God will so germatize that seed of God and it will bring it back and start a Revival in your church why give the devil your teens why give the devil your 20s why give the devil your 30s start tonight giving the Lord Jesus everything you are and when the Devil Comes against you like a flood the spirit of God God will raise up a standard several years ago my wife and I were able to go to Israel it was our second trip there and brother Mike walls had got the trip together and it was a quite quite a busy time in tourism for Israel so You' see one tour guide and then you'd see another and there'd be buses everywhere you would pull up so our tour what I noticed was that for those T gods they would have a small flag now whenever you're on your own bus and you're kind of in your own hotel you can identify okay I'm with that guy and that guy and that guy but when you take thousands of people and you're walking down the streets of Jerusalem it's amazing how the they just all merged together but I thought it was really amazing because you hold up that flag and then you know you're with the right group now what was that flag a standard now you what the devil understands that too that's why he's doing all that he's doing with the transgender move and the gay move and the lesbian move now come on don't get quiet on me on this that's why he's trying to influence our youth and try to sew a question in their mind if they're a boy or a girl well Hallelujah so they don't know so what does our government want to do they want to be able to take our tax dollars and be able to change them out oh if you were born a boy I don't figure God made no mistake if you were born a girl that shouldn't take a scientific research all you got do is open your eyes and look and you should know whether you're a boy or a girl but the devil wants to seow them seeds and the minds of what use start them when they're young started infiltrating their minds what is it the enemy's coming in like a flood remember it was sex in the Garden of Eden that started this fall it ain't no wonder that he's on a rampage right now like never before but young people there's going to be young men and young women that's going to overcome the absolutely Gates of Hell in this day our nation is under a delude of sexual perversion our nation is under a delude of sexual all mind not only that but religious perversion but God has held up a standard in the last day what is it a rallying point a message of Malachi for Hallelujah it is the evening life in order to give us a place that we can rally around now what's amazing is when and you're a tourist and you've got a GoPro and you've got your iPhone and you've got your Nikon and you're taking pictures and all of that you know these is all the sites you've read about all your life and then you're standing there and it's so easy to get caught up and boy you're teaching this picture and that picture and that picture and then you look around and you think oh my goodness where am I what happened to my wife what happened to M where am I where am I so then is when you panic so you start looking at this flag standard Church preacher whatever you want to call it and no that's not it that's the wrong color well you look over there oh this guy's got one he's waving like that and it's oh no no wa that's not it either so what are you looking for you're looking for your standard you see our Jewish tour guide was a Massad agent now you see some of you don't know what Massad it means he does that's why I said what he did one of Israel's most elite Secret Service as a matter of fact when we were in the Dead Sea some of the Mad slipped into Iran broke into some of their main offices broke open their safe and stole some of their top secret documents so we had to be delayed at the Dead Sea because they had to cue him in and let him know what had happened now for us of course well was glad they done it I guess they figured they deemed they needed all that but to him he was absolutely elated why because that's his identity he's a Jew so you and I don't think on it on the same way and we realize that for many people in the age that we're living you know darkness is normal to the average person they live in darkness they're born in darkness they work in darkness they go to school in darkness they are not terrified of Darkness the way we are and when God called pastors see anyone in their Church heading toward Darkness it turns them all to pieces why because darkness is not our element of normaly we do not love Darkness we hate Darkness we hate sin then what does a pastor try to do he tries to raise up that standard before you and say don't go that way don't go that way no no no because he's trying to be mean because he loves you because he loves you you know floods can be spiritually it can be a flood of error so it's just like the flood gates just pour in around the truths that we have one after another after another after another it can be a flood of error it can also be a flood of complacency to where we go to church and we clap our hands and we sing and we get into the routine and the ritual and we're a pretty good believer and you know we're not really doing a whole lot wrong but we're complacent and moderate complacency te just keeps adding and adding and adding and before long we're flooded but we don't even realize it it's washed our joy away it's took away our property as I stood the other day in one of those places over in North Carolina and we pulled up then people come running out of a little Pentecostal Church there that they were using as a distribution place we had generators gasoline water brother Jason they come out there crying squalling hugging us grabbing us saying how could you do this y'all don't even know us you don't even know us so you see whenever floods takes everything you've got and someone comes offering you a little help I brought my generator tonight I brought my water I I I brought anybody here need any anybody need any fire I brought a camp stove I brought I I got you know we've been taking Pringles potato chips and oh to some of you Pringles but if you ain't got nothing you ain't got a kitchen these people had no stoves many of them had no places to cook anything they're asking just for trivial things coats because it's getting cold in the mountains actually snowed there this week you know the flood took everything from them maybe you're looking at yourself tonight and you look back at what you were last year when this Camp was going on you said Lord I've fallen so far Lord I'm not nothing what I was last year there's Hurricane Relief here tonight there's flood relief during this meeting you believe it with me young people I believe right here tonight in the presence of God the Lord Jesus can come and lift the stand watchs us standard I want to hold before you tonight that our God is a deliverer and let me tell you this our God is a god of Second Chances and if you feel like your life is not worth living I'm telling you you're a liar the Lord revealed it to me one day this week when I was praying there's going to be some youth here fighting suicide but let me tell you this right now that suicide Devil's going to have to leave before this meeting is over your life is worth living your life life is worth living don't you let Satan talk you out of your [Applause] life a couple years ago a guy down in Kentucky took his wife his daughters to her mother's house he come back home to their house got his handgun laid it out on the kitchen table laid his cell phone there by it they been backslid for a good while had been listen to preachers or nothing he knew about the word the message but he just got cold on God so he got his gun picked it up in his hand cocked it stuck the Barrel in his mouth and his iPhone started playing a service from Happy Valley Church of Jesus Christ even the Holy Ghost can use an iPhone if he needs to that's my God he loves you so much he'll do whatever he's got to do he loves you so much he will anoint a man of God Amen and put something on his heart he'll anoint men of God to have a use camp for you why in order to wave the banner before you one more time that's what we're here for this weekend we're not here to make you raganit or Glover IES or Watkin IES oh we're here to see that you're filled with the Holy Ghost to see that you find strength and that you know where to go when you leave this place and you can say yes I know what my standard is I know where I'm going it's the message of the hour Satan has tried to pull me away from it but I have been turned once again oh Hallelujah can you imagine the surprise of this man so when I'm preaching and I said you that's sitting there and you feel like ending your life and whatever sermon it was it had been preached months before that don't you tell me our God ain't concern for us you want to know the end of the story he takes the gun out of his mouth uncocks the gun lays it down on the table kneels down at the table rededicates his life back to God why he needed a standard he didn't need a drink he didn't need a fix he didn't need some kind of worldly pleasure he needed something to speak to his soul the devil was coming in like a a flood and the devil was absolutely flooding his mind with these suicide thoughts I don't want to live no more I can't do it no more no devil I ain't getting off this I'm staying on it till the Holy Ghost release me I'm here to tell you tonight young man you got everything to live for young girl but Brother Don you don't know what I've been through I don't need to know what you've been through but what I need to tell you is there's a God who loves you there is a God who's come Amen in these meetings to bring Deliverance to you but I messed up so bad but our God is a god of Second Chances and third chances and fourth chances the question is will you take him up on the chance oh God sometimes it's a flood oh Lord Jesus help me of neutrality just being neutral added to your indifference with a color of moderation of course not anything to just really scare you and frighten you just to get you to compromise sometimes it can be a flood of great sorrow and sadness you remember when the Lord allowed brother Ram's first wife and his baby to go home brother renam got to such despair he tried to take his own life I'm so grateful that God stopped him where would we be tonight you say how could a person do that well I to be honest with you I've never been there myself but I've talked to a lot of people who have and for me to say that I understand it I don't I don't understand it I hope I never go through it but apparently is so much upon them that they just have no more hope left knowing God made us he made us a dimensional creature and in in the in the beginning we should have been sieging soul and body not Spirit remember the prophet said your spirit breaks up when you die now what's in our spirit imagination conscience memory reason and affection your spirit is the communication channel of your whole being remember the woman at the whale and the prophet said that the Lord Jesus called her spirit you ever notice in the discernment when brother random would do that that he he would not say now I I'm waiting to catch your spirit I've never found where he ever said I'm waiting to catch your flesh or I'm waiting to catch your soul and whenever he would catch their Spirit then the mystery of their life would become unfolded let's look at us some of them just from memory off the top of my head I see you coming home from school you've got a yellow check a dress on there's a dog chasing you you run up on the porch and you fall through the door and it scared you the rest of your life now you imagine this woman now many years older than that comes up before the prophet and when she does he doesn't tell her how long her hair is how decent her dress is how many times she reads the Bible every day how many times she prays but he goes to her troubled area not her soul not even her body but the communication channel of this woman opened up and he began to communicate where her problems lay let's let's hear another one so I see that you have a fear a fear of winter time a phobia of winter time every time it goes to getting winter you get a fear and it's caused you to be with bad constipation how peculiar is that now you imagine this poor individual trying to eat fiber and apples and prunes and everything in the world to relieve their problem but the problem was not physical the problem laid in the Avenue of a fear or a phobia but it reflected itself in the body why now the communication channel of course I'm not a prophet no other prophets here on the Earth today but I believe the Holy Ghost can still be able to discern Our Hearts by the preaching of the word of God maybe there's young people here tonight that's been through terrible terrible things in your life and you've come here to this meeting bearing scars and maybe you're not even sh that you even trust me or brother Andrew or brother Jason or any other preacher as far as that goes because you've been so hurt by preachers you've been so let down and so disappointed maybe even by your parents or your grandparents or maybe a a pastor in your life but let me tell you something the failures of human beings has nothing to do with the reality and the power and the faithfulness of almighty God so don't you blame God for the failures of preachers or anybody else come on now is that right now sure we all get hurt I've been hurt too I've been so hurt by preachers my goodness but you know what I refuse to let that stop me because that has nothing to do with my God so what do we want to do we want to bring ourselves before the Lord and let the Lord be able to look down every Avenue of our life and say Lord am I carrying fears and complexes and phobias oh it's unbelievable the amount of phobias that they've diagnosed in this day you've probably read of a lot of them some people have a fear of red some people have a fear of blue some people have a fear of yellow some people have a fear of broccoli I don't fear it but I sure don't like it some people have got a fear of flying some people have got a fear of big crowds it's unbelievable how many fears they've diagnosed call them whatever you want to call them it ain't nothing but a devil I said it ain't nothing but a devil some of you may be the one of the greatest fears is the fear of failure well I want to be a Christian but I'm afraid I'll fall I'm afraid I'll fall short oh sure you're going to fall short but the thing of it is you get right back up and dust yourself off and say Lord I am so sorry I am going to get the best of this thing this besetting sin in my life is not going to destroy me by the grace of God [Applause] I guess some of the saddest things that I've seen in the last few weeks due to catastrophic winds and floods is how floods destroys such valuable things some of them folks that we've been helping they're waiting on their life insurance they told me the other day if we would have been waiting on FEMA we'd been dead but God sent you all to us now we know FEMA's got their hands full we understand that but you realize that what floods do they can rebuild their houses many of them many of them are now finding out they didn't have flood insurance and their house is gone and they're still paying payments on it but they have no house to go to because they don't have flood insurance I'm so glad my eternal life policy has flood insurance my God knew there'd be things come against me that I wouldn't know what to do anybody ever been there every anybody ever been to that spot that you didn't know what to do you didn't know how you was going to get through it but boy I'm so glad the Holy Ghost has got flood insurance and when the enemy comes in like the flood the spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard what's it for it's so let let you know where to Rally around but the devil will do everything he can young people when you get down and you get despondent one the first things he'll do is to cause you to pull away from your church cause you to pull away from your family and for those that can help you recognize that as the devil don't you pull away from your family that loves you don't you pull away from your church family they love you and they are there to help you don't you let that devil lie to you and say they don't love you they do love you one of the brothers today that went out on a a mission to take some of that stuff sent me a picture an hour or so before we come to church of plaques they found Bibles and found all kinds of things somebody sent me a picture not long ago of where that they had found a Bible turned open to the scripture I read tonight when the enemy shall come in like a flood they might be able to replace their car their clothes but what about photographs of their mother their grandmother weddings baby dedications you see what floods do floods try to Rob us from some of the most spiritual intimacy that we have with our lord Jesus and with brothers and sisters knock us out of Fellowship oh my hope somebody's sharing me tonight I want you to notice how Isaiah this word that he chose to use so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west from the West which is where we're from and His glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him now this is the same word that Moses used in Genesis in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God that Hebrew word is ruach Elohim ruach Elohim look at what it means the spirit that breathes quickly in animation Vigor courage and inspiring a static state of Prophecy so when the enemy comes in like a flood Here Comes god with inspiration the spirit ruach I love this meaning of this word the compound of it is spirit of God which is one of the first manifestations of the compound name of God Genesis 1 and it is that he took his wings and began to brood over the Earth so he was brooding and breathing ruach Elohim and when the enemy comes in to destroy God sends this presence so what is the stand Bearer The Spirit of the Lord you know I love quotes and I get discouraged don't you scriptures but I don't mind telling you there's been times in my life I needed a God that had skin on it Ain that right somebody that'll pick up a phone and call you text you WhatsApp you zoom you and whatever else y'all do somebody that God will lay it on their hearts amen you believe is that mindful of you few years ago I was down in my basement at home listen to the tape building a piece of furniture I like to make furniture and a certain man come on my heart that man was many many hundreds of miles from where I live this man had fallen into a terrible terrible sin and the spirit of God quickened to me a quote that I'd heard the prophet say about taking your life I picked up my phone I text this man little did I know he had his gun stuck to his head he had tried to figure out a way to make it look like an accident so his wife would be able to get his insurance claim because another preacher had sent him a real real email a message preacher basically left him no hope no mercy I actually read the email I was ashamed to be honest so this man is sitting there on a stump and his phone goes off and he sees it's me I've known him for several years he picked up that phone into his hand and started reading that what I told him I said the spirit of God come on him and I was down here in the basement I said I'm not sure you know where you at well exactly what you're going through but I'm just going to tell you what he told me to tell you that night he called me couldn't wait to get back to where he could but in phone range wow the enemy was coming in like a flood and well the sad part about it is a message preacher was part of that flood don't make Gods out of preachers God uses them and they'll help you but they're human beings I put my ultimate confidence in no man I got confidence in all these brothers sitting here tonight absolutely but my ultimate confidence is in one right up here because people will let you down y'all ever been let down you ever been disappointed by people oh yes have confidence pray for them but remember remember they are human beings they will make mistakes they'll fall short of the glory of God come on don't get quiet on me now I feel like myself that's one of the reasons why that God allowed brother Brenham to mention some of his own human mistakes in the message because a lot of message people would have never wanted you to read them I cannot follow a preacher that will not admit that he's a human being and that he makes mistakes but I can get behind a man that'll say I fell short of the glory of God I can get behind a man that say church WIll you pray for me I can get behind a prophet of God that whenever he told his wife to tell that liyer that he wasn't in the house and whenever they brought the sick baby that afternoon for him to pray for the Holy Ghost spoke to him and said you're a hypocrite wow my I can imagine the Holy Ghost saying it but I'd still Marvel that I hear a man get up behind the pull pit and say what the Holy Ghost told him knowing that them tapes should be played by five thousands of people that's the kind of man you want to put your confidence in that's the kind of man why he's been through the floods himself oh let me let me hurry you know it's so sad after God has sent us such a wonderful beautiful message that in our own ranks standards are being lifted up by different preachers and Ministries that's bringing confusion now you young people you may go to different camps and you want to be there and be a part of it in Fellowship no doubt you've experienced that one preacher says one thing and another preacher says something else and another preacher says something else and you think what do you believe where do you come back to the standard of this day notice in Isaiah 11:10 in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ins sign of the people which is the standard to it shall the gentille seek and his rest shall be glorious verse 12 and he shall set up an ins sign for the Nations and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four quarters of the earth so who is our who is our standard the Lord Jesus but yet the denominations say the same thing but the problem with man-made religion is that they make their own Jesus so the Baptist have a baptist version of Jesus every denomination has their own version of a Jesus now I don't want to say it to hurt you feelings but I don't I'm not sure that some of the message folks are too far from doing the exact same thing because they've got their own Jesus well Hallelujah a l the denomination they've got a Jesus that'll let them sin and do whatever they want to do and that Jesus will let them come right into heaven they can live any way they want to live that's not the Jesus of the Bible is that right young people so what did they do so they hold up a standard here with the same name on it as ours oh my now those of you that know your your your new testament if you've studied it very well in the interlineal Greek you realize that whenever the great offer was made to the Jews that day when the Lord Jesus stands there and whenever the great man stands and makes the offer so which will you choose I found it amazing several years ago as I was studying on this that I found that oh Lord help me whenever he makes this offer do you want Jesus the king of the Jews but there was another man there remember his name but what I found amazing was his name was not only Barabas but it was Jesus Jesus barabus so here's one Jesus and here's another one oh Lord God help us I you're God's Prophet say listen little church the church in the last days it'll be so close it would deceive the very elected if possible it will be twins it will be a Pentecostal move same mother same movement but different fathers so then what a Catholic priest and an Archbishop or something like that be a twin to brother Jason I me he stands up big toe little toe and wears a dress you know like a woman all that and You' say that's brother Jason's twin so what would brother Jason's twin be someone in the message have to be our twin cannot be Church of Christ it cannot even be Church of God Assembly of God none of that it must be I know this hurts us but young people you're not idiots you're not idiots I'm not here tonight to treat you like a bunch of babies I want you to be able to embrace the truth and realize no doubt many of you have got questions in your heart cuz you're hearing this and that and the other that it brings confusion come back to Christ Jesus the word and remember the Holy Ghost will not deny one word in his holy scriptures so when the enemy comes in against us you imagine Jesus saying it in Matthew 24 4 24 there stand before me that day and say Lord I cast out devils in your name I heal the sick in your name and he'll say I will say unto them depart from me you worker of iniquity for I never knew you that word knew is not knowledge but it is the word that is used for a relationship between a man and a woman it is more than knowing about God you see to the Jews knowledge the Greek word nosis to them it was more than an intellectual conception it was knowing it and then carrying it out that's the way they looked at a real knowledgeable person it wasn't just they could quote and quote and quote but they lived their knowledge oh my that what we want to do where are you tonight young people where do you find yourself are the waters Rising around your feet that sister that I told you about earlier from our church her and her husband wanted to come into my office a week ago on Sunday because she's still dealing with some of this stuff she wanted to thank me for Carol and I praying for her and sharing with me how she felt and watching that water rise and Rise she said brother Donnie I had to go around on the other side of an air conditioning unit so them people would not hear the fear in my voice what's she doing being strong for her patience oh how many preachers in this message stand behind pulpits when they themselves have gone down for the first count the second count and the third count but you see a preacher has to act like he's got the victory he's got to act like he's happy he's got to act like everything is going good when it ain't that's why it's so easy for preachers to get into real trouble and nobody can pick it up because you're part preacher part actor I wonder how these preachers would act how they would behave before you if they acted the way they felt all the time they'd walk out and say well I was going to preach tonight but I'm so think and low down and I'll tell you what I just don't think I ain't got nothing to say y'all go home come back tomorrow I'll try again tomorrow but I ain't promising you nothing now I may not have nothing tomorrow either you would say Lord have mercy what in the world's wrong with brother Jason say what does he do he applies himself he studies he look for something talk about gets up there glory to God I'm telling you we're Victors tonight and he himself is fighting the offest battle he's ever fought in his life I've set in counsel people many times people from around the world they come from around the world to talk to you to get advice and I'm sitting there with dealing with more than they are and I'm thinking you flew from the UK to come here and talk to me about this I wish that was my problem but what is it each of us have floods you're not going to be exempt from them but this is the question how will you deal with it when it comes amen let me stop right now is a good time let bar it Hallelujah so I wonder the first night of these precious times together would there be anybody here one or many that would raise your hand and say I need help I don't want to wait till Sunday God knows I need help tonight maybe you find yourself in over your head maybe so far it's just up on your heels if your shoes or maybe your socks are just now getting wet but you don't want to wait you say Lord why should I head this thing off tonight anybody else with ever a head bath please please just raise your hand to the Lord we're not going to embarrass you we're not going to humiliate you pull on you or anything like that amen Lord Jesus I believe tonight that we are in such a great great War Lord as I read today where Israel had finally been able to take out one of their greatest enemies one who has killed many thousands of their people no doubt in Israel many happy people are rejoicing because of this one man that they were able to take out Lord God brother Andrew and myself are here this week to help every individual that'll attend these Services first and foremost our priority of course is the youths but then the adults that have brought them and come with them oh Jesus we want to be able to leave this campground on Sunday afternoon also rejoicing in our hearts because an enemy of lust has been slain an enemy of suicide an enemy of distrust Lord maybe there's some here tonight that they've just are just not sure there maybe some Lord that have come and they thought this is my last meeting I ain't coming back to another one but Lord Jesus may your presence sweep down in this place tonight father maybe they've went down for the first count for the second count and they just came because well I I'll go I'm not sure I'll get anything but may the spirit of God lift a standard here these few days we know that that day on Calvary a standard was lifted like had never been lifted before when you come to the Earth to become one of us oh Lord we Marvel that you become a sheep but I'm Marvel even greater that you become a goat cuz your Prophet said you become that goat and our sins was laid upon you and Paul said you who knew no sin become the very oh my you become our sin that we might become the very righteousness of God in him now now hear him saying demonology part two paragraph 199 I think of how that Jesus when he died God sent him to hell because of his sins but you never said one thing wrong or did one thing wrong where did you get sins mine these young people's sins you took them upon yourself and you went down into hell Hallelujah you died alone so when I come to die I won't have to when my little girl a year ago yesterday Lord when she started entering into that channel we was all in the room praying praying praying but it became evident you were going to take her I get up from my chair open my phone to Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I'm so glad Lord Jesus in Good Times in shouting times you're there but oh in times of flood you're there and when death comes we don't have to scream like a coward glory to God because we will not die alone and you screamed out on the cross the standard was on the cross and you said Eli Eli L May sebasty my God my God why why why H has Thou forsaken me thank you Lord Jesus thank you I look to you tonight as my healer my deliver I'm going to point every person in this building everyone that'll go back and archive those that'll stream this service right now whatever your trouble is tonight I want to point you to a flag an ins

mighty part in the name of Jesus I speak to every demon Out of Hell turn God's people loose we have come here with a message of Deliverance Satan let me give you well good warning tonight you might as well pack your bags and go back to Hell Hallelujah we have not come for just an intellectual Gathering we have come for deliverance we have come for healing We've Come For Peace we've come come to realize once again where our standard is for this day it is the message of the hour pointing not to a book not to just a tape but to a living resurrected savior who's coming for his bride a tape did not die for us a tape is not coming back for us a preacher did not die for us but the Lord Jesus is what died for us we're not raised and or looking for a doctor and we're not looking for theology

vision of you only he can do that all he needs you to do is surrender I'm going to tell you something friends this world brother Donnie spoke about the the insanity of the age that we live in and it's an unparalleled day you live in there's never been a day like it there's never been an age where Satan become by the by the popular vote he becomes the god of the evil age never been a day this is an un unparalleled time brother Bram shows that that's exactly what Paul was showing at the end there would be things that happen in the day that you live in that only happen in the day you live in he's the god of the evil age he's now had 6,000 years to build his Eden no age has ever had to face simultaneously the days of Noah and the days of lot right now amen you know the world and all of their Insanity I was I was sitting there thinking as brother Donnie was talking about all the the crazy things that they want me to they expect me to change my definition of what is a male and a female they expect me to adopt their woke language and you know something I'm not going to do that I I don't intend to admit that what they say is true and you know what I'm not talking now about politics because I'm not a politician we're not here brother Donnie's not here to make a political speech I'm not you know what I'm GNA hold up a standard I'm not going to allow someone who's not a Christian to be called a Christian even right it just doesn't matter you might have been in a message Church you might believe God said I'm Prophet but I'm here to tell you it's more than just lip service it's a real experience and I'm holding a standard to say we will not compromise we will not acquest to the enemy with we're not backing up we're going [Music] forward Hallelujah I think we ought to have a standard to say a real believer is a holy ghost filled on Fire full of the Zeal of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah you know this is why I so appreciate the promise that Jesus made in in John chapter 6 I believe the 39th verse of memory serves where he says here he says that that all the father has given me right amen you remember the scripture and they'll come and and and and Jesus said I lose nothing and it's always stood out to me that he didn't say people because of course a gene of God cannot be lost but friends it's not just because that you are a gene of God it's not just people that he won't lose he loses nothing that means that whatever you were supposed to be whatever God envisioned I'm here to tell you I don't care what's happened to you in your life and Satan may have taken it from you and you may have had every kind of flood and every kind of that the enemy has come into your life it might have been a preacher it might have been your home it might have been a a a boyfriend a girlfriend an experience and tonight you feel like what has been taken from me I'm here to tell you the vision of God is Not diminished and the message of the hour has come to give it back to you it's not just people but it's whatever you were supposed to be I'm here to tell you you can be that tonight starting tonight it doesn't even matter if you were involved in the loss Jesus gives it back [Applause] Hallelujah I'm going to tell you something friends I hope you'll take my word for it the Lord passed in front of me and spoke to me directly and I don't listen let me tell you I'm just going to tell you what he told me a lot of times we're preaching to adults and we're preaching to parents and we're saying you need to you need to raise a standard in your home you need to come back to the oldfashioned we say that across our pull pit but the Lord said to me and I don't know it might only be one person in here tonight I don't know what's going on in your home or what's going on in your family but I'm here to tell you God might have you to be the standard because brother brandham said concerning that scripture when an enemy comes in like a flood and he raises a standard brother brandham says that's you raising yourself up in prayer I'm here to tell you I don't know what kind of home you came from but God might be using you tonight to go back home and reverse it and say I'm going to influence my parents I'm going to influence my siblings I'm going to influence my whole church Hallelujah and all he's ever needed is a surrendered friend a surrendered heart tonight and I believe that God can restore you back to whatever you might have arrived at this camp and say I'm missing some pieces I'm here to tell you Jesus gives them back that's what this word is this message is not books and tapes and quotes it's a person of Jesus Christ do you believe it tonight do you really believe it tonight oh let's sing it again I surrender all I'm here to tell you that's all that's ever been necessary you can't do it and but he can and he's ready to do it and you say Lord tonight I surrender all whatever you might have fallen from God can bring it back whatever's happened in your home God can restore it whatever's happened in your church God can use use you to be the Catalyst God can use you to raise a standard no wonder he has to restore everything because I'm going to tell you something friends you can't let this flood get past you I want to challenge you tonight my whole heart is just on fire with this you might be the only standard and the enemy is flooding over your home your family your siblings your church and you might be the only standard left standing to say thus far and no further and I'm going to begin to turn this tide back around and we're going to take it back in the other direction Hallelujah friends that's what I believe we don't have to wait for another night it can happen tonight in this building in this service right where you stand right now say Lord God let me be a St standard in my home how many tonight let me be a standard to my siblings let me go back to my church and be a standard for the word of God Hallelujah Lord Jesus tonight Lord we're not trying to preach by the preacher but my heart is so stirred oh God may you challenge these young men and these young women tonight and say tonight I accept the obligation to be a standard I lift myself up in prayer and I surrender all that I am to Christ that he might use me Grant it Lord grant it to us tonight friends that's your desire raise that hand up to the Lord and say Lord God let that be me let that be me oh from this night forward I will be the standard among my youth group at home I will be the standard I will turn back the flood of the enemy Hallelujah I believe God will do it for you right now right where you stand Hallelujah I believe he say why do you believe it because I've seen him do it so many times again and again and again he's
