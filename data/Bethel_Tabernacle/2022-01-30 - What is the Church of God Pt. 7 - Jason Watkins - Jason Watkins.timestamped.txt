[47:26] many want to be a servant of the lord
[47:28] you know some friends i i
[47:30] i have so little to
[47:32] um you know
[47:35] there's very little good i can say about
[47:38] myself but one thing that i appreciate
[47:41] that the lord has always given me from
[47:44] the time i was just a small child very
[47:46] young i mean i can remember
[47:49] all the way back to services
[47:51] in uh in gastonia north carolina um at
[47:55] the tabernacle there what was the name
[47:57] of that sister mom that tabernacle what
[47:59] was the name of that
[48:00] gas tabernacle of
[48:02] gastonia i don't remember
[48:04] it might have been the tabernacle the
[48:06] tabernacle amen amen so uh i am either
[48:10] from the ohio state university or i'm
[48:12] from the tabernacle amen so
[48:15] praise the lord and uh just five years
[48:17] old i couldn't have been hey mom maybe
[48:19] five
[48:21] i remember in those services sitting
[48:23] there thank you sir uh no anthony bring
[48:26] me my regular water that's for
[48:27] afterwards thank you
[48:29] i remember sitting there as just a boy
[48:32] desiring thinking to myself i didn't
[48:34] want to grow up and be a fireman or a
[48:36] policeman or whatever or even the
[48:38] president i wanted to be a servant of
[48:40] the lord amen just from a child and and
[48:43] that never left me it never left me all
[48:45] through my young teenage
[48:47] life and i wasn't um
[48:49] the voracious reader then that i am now
[48:53] but uh thanks sir when i did read um i
[48:57] my my books and my heroes were great
[48:59] missionaries amen and i always just
[49:02] envision myself
[49:03] you know just carrying the gospel to the
[49:05] deepest darkest areas of the world amen
[49:08] and so i appreciate
[49:11] being today
[49:12] god's servant and if i'm his servant
[49:15] then i'm your servant and remember that
[49:18] our text was he that is greatest among
[49:20] you shall be your servant this is a
[49:24] thought that should be on the front of
[49:27] your mind constantly as a christian
[49:30] don't let
[49:31] the kingdom order in servanthood be
[49:34] something in the back of your mind that
[49:36] you you know it's just a nice thing we
[49:38] look at or we think about it we consider
[49:40] we talk about it no no this should be
[49:43] front and center in the mind of a
[49:45] christian
[49:46] jesus said that the son of man now is
[49:49] there anybody greater than the lord
[49:50] jesus
[49:52] come on is there anybody greater than
[49:54] the lord jesus
[49:55] no
[49:56] not everybody combined wouldn't be
[49:58] greater than him
[49:59] and he said of his own self and his
[50:02] ministry the son of man now catch it the
[50:04] son of man because what is the son of
[50:06] man what's the ministry of son of man
[50:08] word made flesh
[50:09] so you're in the ministry of the son of
[50:11] man amen because you're the word made
[50:13] flesh is that right how many like that
[50:15] he said i'm the ministry i operate the
[50:18] ministry the son of man i have allowed
[50:20] the word to live through my flesh
[50:22] remember as we said to you
[50:25] a previous time that the goal of this
[50:28] book is to
[50:30] do away with the need for this book
[50:33] that when this book is fully manifested
[50:36] this will live behind flesh
[50:39] amen and that's the ministry of the son
[50:42] of man it's different from the office
[50:43] office of son of man is a prophet but
[50:46] the ministry of son of man is the word a
[50:48] prophet brings living inside of you
[50:51] that's why you're the final voice to the
[50:53] final age that's that's why that in
[50:56] revelation 19 you read about that group
[50:58] that rides out with jesus
[51:00] remember that on white horses and the
[51:02] bible says i heard voices in heavens and
[51:05] thunderings remember that did you know
[51:07] that in the hebrew that the word thunder
[51:10] and the word voice in the hebrew the
[51:11] same hebrew word
[51:14] see because it it literally means that
[51:17] the word now is is and brother branham
[51:19] talks about the voice of many waters and
[51:21] thunderings and lightnings that that's
[51:23] that's god's family that thundering is
[51:26] the voice of god in the people amen so
[51:30] so we find then that brother branham
[51:33] then would tie
[51:34] revelation 19 back to revelation 17 14.
[51:39] that brother branham did that because
[51:41] it's a group of people that had three
[51:44] distinct characteristics about them they
[51:47] were they were called
[51:49] they were chosen and they were faithful
[51:53] amen now listen friends you might make
[51:55] all kinds of mistakes in life you may
[51:57] not do everything according to the way
[52:00] that god has desired how many of us have
[52:03] failed
[52:04] come on see but you know my my wife my
[52:08] wife to me i mean to me she's the most
[52:10] perfect woman alive but you know what
[52:13] there's been some time she overcooked my
[52:15] toast a little bit
[52:17] yeah it's true
[52:18] uh it's true there's been times where
[52:21] she left a little mark of an iron you
[52:23] know in one of my pairs of pants but
[52:25] yeah but you know yeah and yeah but you
[52:27] know i'm gonna move on quickly
[52:30] but
[52:30] but but you know here here's the point i
[52:33] want to make it's a glorious point that
[52:35] has nothing to do with her faithfulness
[52:38] her faithfulness is that she reserves
[52:40] her betting ground for my seat alone she
[52:43] will not open her bedding ground to the
[52:44] seat of any other man
[52:46] see and she she's found faithful to me
[52:49] and the and the bride of jesus christ at
[52:51] the end of all of her ups and downs all
[52:53] of her failures all of her mistakes she
[52:56] was still found faithful because she
[52:58] reserved her mind her heart her soul to
[53:02] the seed of god alone and and we can say
[53:06] like brother branham lord you know i
[53:09] never did commit adultery against your
[53:11] word
[53:13] as soon as i understood it by divine
[53:15] revelation i've stayed faithful to it
[53:18] all these years
[53:20] once you revealed yourself to me lord
[53:22] and you became my husband i never
[53:24] accepted the seed of another no
[53:26] denomination no man-made creed no
[53:29] ideology nothing of the devil or the
[53:32] antichrist i i am faithful
[53:36] to his word
[53:39] so we find then that whosoever so
[53:42] there's something to be said about being
[53:44] humble
[53:47] to be god's servant jesus said the son
[53:50] of man
[53:52] came not
[53:54] to be served
[53:56] your king james uses the word minister
[53:58] he came not to be ministered to
[54:01] but to minister he came not to be served
[54:05] but to serve amen
[54:07] now
[54:08] i came across this saying i have no idea
[54:11] who wrote it it wasn't titled i don't
[54:13] know who wrote it if you ever find the
[54:15] source i would appreciate knowing it i
[54:17] thought it was wonderful
[54:19] watch now
[54:21] kingdom order
[54:23] in servanthood i love these three bars
[54:26] here
[54:27] i slept
[54:29] and dreamt that life was joy
[54:33] i awoke and saw that life was service
[54:37] i served and behold service was joy
[54:41] i love that
[54:43] i just love that
[54:45] now i want to go to some quotes of
[54:47] brother branham and
[54:49] i'm just going to say that if these
[54:51] quotes of brother branham if it sounds
[54:53] like that i'm aiming these uh these
[54:55] quotes that preachers here that's only
[54:58] because i am
[55:00] okay so that that's the only reason
[55:02] it'll come across that way all right but
[55:05] but now it's it's also to anyone who
[55:08] serves the lord in any capacity but
[55:10] especially preachers
[55:12] all right so so so i mean
[55:15] you know when when
[55:17] when you don't uh you know when when you
[55:21] don't
[55:22] when you're not humble to the to the
[55:25] leadership of the lord then then this is
[55:27] exactly why you end up out of the line
[55:30] in order of his word
[55:32] amen see
[55:33] so the line and order of god's word is
[55:36] paramount anything outside
[55:40] of the line and order of god's word in
[55:42] your life that's why i've been preaching
[55:43] on kingdom order
[55:45] because anything outside of the line in
[55:47] order of god's word
[55:49] will fail it must fail
[55:52] i don't care however long it goes and it
[55:54] might look like solomon talks about
[55:57] sometimes that that men who are even
[56:00] outside of the order of god's word that
[56:03] they brought prosper
[56:05] and
[56:06] solomon said their branches go out like
[56:09] a bombay tree
[56:12] but by and by
[56:15] you mark it down
[56:16] by and by it'll wither see because
[56:19] that's not eternal anything that's not
[56:22] eternal has to have an end i'm not here
[56:25] to extend my life i'm here to have
[56:27] eternal
[56:28] life see
[56:30] so in order sometimes you you you have
[56:33] to go back to go forward that you that's
[56:36] the order of the bible always there you
[56:38] know that's it's things new and old
[56:40] because in order to you know this
[56:42] message is not new
[56:44] this message is a restore restoration of
[56:46] the of the former
[56:48] so it's new it's new it's not new in the
[56:51] sense that it's another gospel because
[56:52] you can't bring another gospel the
[56:54] foundation is already laid part elated
[56:57] and you can't add to or take away from
[56:59] the word that's already established but
[57:02] what it is is it must go back and pick
[57:04] up the old to go forward so you've got
[57:06] to go back to go forward amen that that
[57:09] that that's why the message come to us
[57:11] in this day because the alpha church
[57:15] did not go on to a body change see and
[57:18] and instead of christ being able to come
[57:21] and get his bride uh matt i'm going to
[57:23] move this back a little bit because i'm
[57:25] getting some wind noise and i that
[57:26] little sock
[57:28] that little sock comes off
[57:30] what are you saying
[57:32] okay am i not there okay perfect
[57:36] so we find that
[57:38] that you know they they didn't go into a
[57:41] rapture they
[57:42] they fell away after the apostles and it
[57:45] was predicted and you see it already
[57:47] starting that's why the apostles were
[57:48] saying you need to earnestly contend for
[57:50] the faith once delivered because it was
[57:52] already starting to wane and slip
[57:54] and and you find that
[57:56] that that that because they didn't and
[57:59] instead of christ being able to come
[58:01] i've said this before but instead of
[58:03] christ being able to come and rapture a
[58:06] bride and receive his bride we find out
[58:08] that he had to sit back down in the
[58:10] eternities and seal up the word with
[58:13] seven seals and and intercede for on
[58:16] behalf of the ignorance down through the
[58:18] ages so that he could redeem his bride
[58:20] out of every age amen
[58:23] and so you know the the first part of
[58:25] the church ages is really the messengers
[58:28] those angels that were stars in his
[58:30] right hand they're just basically trying
[58:32] to hold the line and uh they're they're
[58:36] they're in a situation where it's just
[58:38] slipping further and further and they're
[58:39] trying to earnestly contend for the
[58:41] faith once delivered but we find them
[58:43] that under the restoration about the
[58:45] time of martin luther now he's going to
[58:47] begin to restore the brag tree see and
[58:50] and the problem was that those
[58:52] messengers never had a exact clear
[58:55] knowledge of what the original was so
[58:58] they just all they could do is preach
[58:59] the revelation they had and that was
[59:01] enough
[59:02] amen but we find that the promise was in
[59:06] matthew 13 that that at the end time god
[59:09] would send his messengers who under
[59:12] their prophet
[59:13] with their prophet and under their
[59:14] prophet would be a final voice to the
[59:16] final age they would separate the good
[59:18] from the evil
[59:19] amen
[59:20] and and and they would the rest would be
[59:22] committed to the to the burning of a
[59:24] tribulation and and uh redeemed would be
[59:26] taken into the garner and so you you
[59:29] find this is a constant order of god's
[59:32] word this is you see these patterns
[59:35] friends i can't tell you today
[59:37] i i can't
[59:39] words would fail me to express
[59:42] how important it is
[59:45] that you
[59:46] know
[59:47] and be willing because you have to be
[59:49] willing he won't force you and be
[59:51] willing to observe the line and order of
[59:56] god's word in your marriage in your home
[1:00:00] in your finances in your church
[1:00:03] attendance
[1:00:06] in your tithing and offering
[1:00:08] this is the line in order of god's word
[1:00:11] i mean it's you know it's it it it's
[1:00:14] it's you know he and i just say this for
[1:00:16] the benefit of the young teenagers who
[1:00:18] are starting to come on and starting to
[1:00:20] work jobs don't forget that brother
[1:00:22] diggs was reminding you of that the
[1:00:25] other service make sure that you don't
[1:00:27] steal from god that would be all such a
[1:00:29] horrible thing
[1:00:31] that you end up stealing from god but
[1:00:34] it's not just that it's also your
[1:00:36] offerings your free will to god you see
[1:00:39] that really is an indicator of where
[1:00:41] your heart is
[1:00:42] toward god
[1:00:44] and what you think about the word going
[1:00:46] forth amen
[1:00:49] praise the lord
[1:00:50] all right so
[1:00:52] so so this line in order this is why
[1:00:54] when we look at the
[1:00:56] at the line in order of god's word for
[1:00:59] what's to perfect this bride now
[1:01:01] you've got a a movement of wonderful
[1:01:03] people
[1:01:04] who have changed the order to say that
[1:01:07] you just need to gather and and just
[1:01:10] push play
[1:01:12] pushing play is a wonderful thing
[1:01:14] you should do it every day of your life
[1:01:17] you should listen to a tape of god's
[1:01:19] prophet every day of your life listen to
[1:01:22] two or three of them if you can if you
[1:01:23] can squeeze it in it's just as important
[1:01:26] as your bible reading and your prayer
[1:01:27] time which should also dominate your
[1:01:29] schedule amen come on
[1:01:31] amen see and and so they espouse now
[1:01:35] that let's just gather in a building to
[1:01:38] put to push play and now that that's
[1:01:42] perfectly fine
[1:01:43] for there in jeffersonville that that's
[1:01:46] perfectly fine because at least they're
[1:01:48] obeying the bible they're assembling
[1:01:51] they're coming together see
[1:01:53] but but
[1:01:54] what the short-sightedness of that is
[1:01:57] is what about the
[1:01:59] the now countless number around the
[1:02:02] world of families who are not gathering
[1:02:05] they've left churches and they now sit
[1:02:07] at home
[1:02:08] and push play
[1:02:10] and and and now there's where the
[1:02:13] problem is because
[1:02:14] 99
[1:02:16] of the people in the world can't gather
[1:02:19] there
[1:02:20] only that group can gather what about
[1:02:23] all the rest who now have forsaken
[1:02:25] shepherds and for and they don't come
[1:02:27] around and there's benefits to you
[1:02:29] coming in the church there's benefits to
[1:02:32] you rubbing shoulders with one another
[1:02:34] there's benefits for being one for all
[1:02:36] and all for one and having an all to be
[1:02:38] to be in prayer for
[1:02:40] when you when you when you stay away you
[1:02:43] violate god's word and now you're taking
[1:02:45] a very good thing push play you're
[1:02:48] taking a very good thing and you're
[1:02:50] turning it into something to a
[1:02:52] disadvantage
[1:02:53] you see
[1:02:54] beautiful wonderful people love them no
[1:02:56] know all of those leadership there i
[1:02:58] know a law grew up around them
[1:03:00] wonderful people not talking about that
[1:03:02] not that not that at all but you see
[1:03:05] when you go off the line in order of
[1:03:07] god's word and you stop gathering i mean
[1:03:10] where where's where's the shepherd to
[1:03:12] bear your needs before god in prayer
[1:03:15] where where's the people to pray for you
[1:03:17] and pray with you and and pray for your
[1:03:19] young people and and see the gospel
[1:03:21] preached into their lives
[1:03:24] amen see that's what they're not
[1:03:26] thinking about
[1:03:28] works fine for the one percent that can
[1:03:30] gather there but what about the rest of
[1:03:31] the world they're leaving churches
[1:03:33] see
[1:03:34] and i'm gonna hear i'm here to tell you
[1:03:36] you need to come here for growth
[1:03:39] you need to rub shoulders
[1:03:43] there's some people who really
[1:03:45] grow you
[1:03:49] and you need that amen
[1:03:53] uh who was it just singing i need you
[1:03:55] you need me we're all a part of god's
[1:03:58] army stand with me agree with me amen i
[1:04:01] love that song brother fred has made
[1:04:03] that song famous among the bride we love
[1:04:05] that song might get anthony to try to
[1:04:07] sing that when he comes back up but
[1:04:09] but you know this is why
[1:04:12] the line in order of god's word is so
[1:04:16] important this is exactly why paul said
[1:04:20] don't forsake the assembling of
[1:04:22] yourselves together see so that brings
[1:04:26] it outside of the line and order of
[1:04:28] god's word and then you you end up you
[1:04:32] end up by that decision hindering you
[1:04:34] you you listen here here's something
[1:04:37] they're not thinking about
[1:04:40] you know teenagers
[1:04:41] have to have their own experience
[1:04:44] they can't get in on mom and dad's
[1:04:45] experience they've got to know christ
[1:04:47] personally
[1:04:48] i was raised in this message from the
[1:04:51] day i was born as a baby sat in brother
[1:04:53] branham's meetings prayed for healed
[1:04:55] miraculously under william branham's
[1:04:57] prayer
[1:04:58] that's why i was so glad when that
[1:05:00] baptist theologian tried to challenge me
[1:05:02] on that he said i bet you don't know a
[1:05:03] single person ever healed under his
[1:05:04] prayer i said well actually i know one
[1:05:06] pretty good mwah
[1:05:10] you know and so um so his only excuse
[1:05:13] was oh all you know is what your mom and
[1:05:15] dad told you well i'm sorry maybe you
[1:05:16] didn't have an honorable mom and dad i
[1:05:18] did
[1:05:19] i do so i believe what they told me
[1:05:22] and so
[1:05:23] so so you know uh the the point comes
[1:05:26] down to
[1:05:27] how that
[1:05:29] you know
[1:05:30] until that teenager
[1:05:32] gets a
[1:05:33] gets a hold of their own experience a
[1:05:36] church family the interaction the
[1:05:38] assembling ourselves together helps hang
[1:05:41] on to them it keeps them close to the
[1:05:43] fire until god can get a hold of their
[1:05:45] life
[1:05:46] when you just sit them in a house and
[1:05:48] all you do is push a push play if they
[1:05:51] don't that you might be liking it
[1:05:52] because you've got the holy ghost but to
[1:05:54] them it's just the letter until it's
[1:05:56] until it's a experience of the lord
[1:05:59] and what will happen is they'll hit
[1:06:01] they'll hit that mid teenage years and
[1:06:03] you know what will happen they won't sit
[1:06:05] there and listen to push play anymore
[1:06:06] they'll head out to the world they'll
[1:06:08] enter and marry among unbelievers i've
[1:06:10] seen it happen
[1:06:12] you can't fool me i hadn't been doing
[1:06:14] this too long i've been pastoring too
[1:06:15] long i've seen the consequence of what
[1:06:17] happens to teenagers when mom and dad
[1:06:20] don't visit the house of god with their
[1:06:23] family on a regular discipline basis
[1:06:26] they say well teenagers leave the church
[1:06:28] too sure they do of course they do but
[1:06:30] at least they've got better odds
[1:06:33] if they're here i can pray for them i
[1:06:36] can befriend them i can bring my my
[1:06:38] friendship upon them as a as a weapon
[1:06:42] as an influence i do that's how i raise
[1:06:44] my boys
[1:06:45] my boys were young men and you you
[1:06:47] eventually you realize you can't just
[1:06:50] make every decision for the life i
[1:06:51] didn't even want to do that so i just
[1:06:53] made sure that i built a relationship
[1:06:55] with them and today i still have a
[1:06:58] measure of control through influence
[1:07:02] over my sons because they love me and
[1:07:05] they trust me and i've built a rapport
[1:07:07] with them and and and i can receive
[1:07:10] advice from them they can receive advice
[1:07:12] from me this is the line in order of
[1:07:15] god's word
[1:07:17] amen
[1:07:19] oh let me get to my preachers all right
[1:07:24] listen up your brothers now but remember
[1:07:26] it's everybody
[1:07:28] see don't pitchfork this you preachers
[1:07:30] better you you preach listening
[1:07:32] everybody
[1:07:33] because we're all servants of god
[1:07:37] a group of methodist brethren that just
[1:07:40] received the holy ghost brother branham
[1:07:42] saying here
[1:07:44] uh the holy spirit came to my church
[1:07:47] and where i used to pastor and they was
[1:07:49] great men lived up in indiana
[1:07:51] and they had said brother branham after
[1:07:53] we've received the holy ghost we've been
[1:07:56] reading some books said should we wait
[1:07:58] on the lord and seek the lord
[1:08:01] to tell us our ministry
[1:08:04] i said
[1:08:05] don't do it at all
[1:08:07] he said well the book said i said but
[1:08:08] wait a minute brother
[1:08:10] if you ever take men
[1:08:12] that's so zealous
[1:08:14] that they want to always be doing
[1:08:16] something god couldn't trust that person
[1:08:19] if you'll notice in the bible the man
[1:08:22] that god used was the man was trying to
[1:08:24] get away from all of it that's the one
[1:08:27] that god used take for instance paul
[1:08:29] moses and so forth trying to run
[1:08:31] from the very cause see now brother
[1:08:35] branham is not against zeal
[1:08:38] he's not against the desire to serve god
[1:08:40] i had a desire to be a servant since i
[1:08:42] was a child
[1:08:44] but it but but there's a fine line that
[1:08:47] that comes between you letting god put
[1:08:50] your your your gift forward
[1:08:54] and you trying to push it forward and
[1:08:56] boy have i learned that the hard way too
[1:08:58] many times i'm sorry to say
[1:09:00] all right if a man's
[1:09:02] god would give
[1:09:04] man to do a certain thing
[1:09:07] and he was so zealous of it the first
[1:09:09] thing you know he'd be so swelled out
[1:09:11] but if a man doesn't want to do such
[1:09:14] maybe god can use him for a while anyhow
[1:09:16] if you just can get something out of him
[1:09:19] but men that usually wants to go and
[1:09:21] blast over the world and tear it down
[1:09:23] usually god can't trust him because he
[1:09:26] he can't he wants to do it himself he
[1:09:28] gets into his own way with it if a man
[1:09:31] don't want to go then god almost has to
[1:09:34] drive him to it that's the type of man
[1:09:37] that god usually uses in the scripture
[1:09:41] amen
[1:09:42] i wanted to be a servant of god
[1:09:45] i wanted to be a missionary i didn't
[1:09:46] want to be a pastor
[1:09:49] i didn't
[1:09:50] i ran from that like crazy when they
[1:09:52] first asked me to do it i said no way i
[1:09:54] knew what come with that
[1:09:56] i wanted to be a missionary i wanted to
[1:09:58] be loose to make you know just to go
[1:10:00] around the world but but but then i but
[1:10:02] then when god put put me in this
[1:10:04] position and i and i've always i've
[1:10:07] always just had to be driven to it and
[1:10:09] one day sister debbie and i were writing
[1:10:11] i was preaching meetings in phoenix and
[1:10:13] i had this tape playing here you him and
[1:10:14] brother branham makes this statement you
[1:10:16] know the only kind of man that god can
[1:10:19] use you know uh is a man that don't want
[1:10:22] to go and then god almost has to drive
[1:10:25] him to it and he said that's the type of
[1:10:27] man that god usually uses in the
[1:10:28] scripture and i just pushed paul's and i
[1:10:30] said i said to sister debbie i said i'll
[1:10:32] never get out of this
[1:10:33] she said why i said because i don't want
[1:10:35] to do it so bad
[1:10:36] and since that's true he'll never let me
[1:10:38] out i'm apparently i'm the guy he can
[1:10:41] use
[1:10:42] so
[1:10:42] so all right so now watch
[1:10:45] so i said
[1:10:48] watch here's the instruction
[1:10:49] you just live for him and love him with
[1:10:52] all your heart he will place you in the
[1:10:55] place that he desires for you to be
[1:10:57] that's right
[1:10:58] why try to take another man's place see
[1:11:02] we can't do that we must always abide in
[1:11:05] our calling where god has called us to
[1:11:08] and that's beautiful
[1:11:10] all right that is so so wonderful all
[1:11:13] right let me make sure i want to just
[1:11:15] carry on here uh i do all right now
[1:11:17] let's look at some more
[1:11:19] 1959 questions and answers
[1:11:22] god has a hard time trying to get
[1:11:25] somebody
[1:11:26] that he can deal with
[1:11:28] that that'll stay humble and meek and
[1:11:31] stay in the place until god calls him to
[1:11:34] do something you believe that see
[1:11:37] a man that god can bless and heal keeps
[1:11:40] and and he'll still keep himself a man
[1:11:43] not be an angel or a god as soon as a
[1:11:46] man gets blessed and has a little
[1:11:48] something given to him he wants to
[1:11:49] become a god he wants to become an angel
[1:11:51] he wants to become some great person
[1:11:53] what i do what me me and mine all of
[1:11:56] that that's the wrong attitude
[1:12:00] god's hunting for somebody who he could
[1:12:03] bless and pour out blessings and more he
[1:12:07] blessed the littler the man will become
[1:12:11] and you'll never get more of god until
[1:12:14] you become nothing
[1:12:17] remember that brothers my fellow
[1:12:19] minister brothers and all of you you'll
[1:12:22] never everybody it's not it's not just
[1:12:24] ministers it's anybody holding any
[1:12:26] position and it's anybody in the church
[1:12:28] of christ
[1:12:30] i'm preaching on what is the church of
[1:12:32] god are you part of the church of god
[1:12:36] then you have a calling and you'll never
[1:12:38] get more of god until you become nothing
[1:12:41] you've got to belittle yourself
[1:12:45] he that will exalt himself god will
[1:12:47] bring a base he that will humble himself
[1:12:49] god will exalt you've got to get little
[1:12:52] before you can get big and you'll never
[1:12:55] be big in your own self you'll only be
[1:12:57] as big as god will be big in you
[1:13:01] see and so even if you get big you're
[1:13:03] not big because it's all god all right
[1:13:07] not beautiful you're good everybody good
[1:13:10] breathe just breathe
[1:13:12] it's okay
[1:13:13] all right let me let your blood get
[1:13:14] going again all
[1:13:16] right lean not to thy own understanding
[1:13:20] 1965
[1:13:22] why you're in the best class that there
[1:13:24] is sons and daughters of god isn't that
[1:13:27] wonderful
[1:13:28] why would you want to be anything
[1:13:29] besides that see
[1:13:31] well i like that company better than i i
[1:13:34] would with all the i like that company
[1:13:36] better than i would with all the kings
[1:13:38] and poe takes and everything else give
[1:13:40] me that humble bunch of people if they
[1:13:44] don't know their right hand from their
[1:13:45] left as long as they know god and love
[1:13:48] him and serve him that's the celebrity
[1:13:52] of heaven let me tell you something
[1:13:54] friends when we stay humble like that
[1:13:56] when that's our attitude there just is
[1:13:58] no way for satan to ever cause divisions
[1:14:01] among us
[1:14:02] it's it's totally impossible because
[1:14:04] we're constantly humbling ourselves
[1:14:07] before god
[1:14:08] and
[1:14:09] each other
[1:14:10] see
[1:14:11] no big eyes and little you see
[1:14:14] humble
[1:14:15] ourselves
[1:14:17] all right
[1:14:18] next one
[1:14:19] i think this is my last one
[1:14:22] from humble thyself 1963 you know
[1:14:25] people want
[1:14:26] power and really they don't know what
[1:14:29] power is
[1:14:31] that's true see
[1:14:33] all right
[1:14:34] so he's not condemning them
[1:14:38] it's not what this quote's about
[1:14:39] this isn't here to make you feel bad
[1:14:41] he's not condemning them he's not even
[1:14:43] saying anything evil about them
[1:14:46] these people
[1:14:48] imagine themselves doing great things
[1:14:51] for god and that's a good thing
[1:14:53] that's a wonderful thing that's
[1:14:55] heavenworthy
[1:14:57] see
[1:14:58] so but but they're going about it all
[1:15:01] wrong
[1:15:02] they have a misunderstanding
[1:15:05] of what real power with god is just say
[1:15:09] nothing of how to operate it see
[1:15:12] to have to operate it in a way that
[1:15:15] brings glory to god alone
[1:15:19] alone
[1:15:20] alone
[1:15:23] that brings glory to god
[1:15:26] alone
[1:15:30] now another side of it friends
[1:15:34] is when you know
[1:15:36] another side of it is sometimes when an
[1:15:37] evil spirit
[1:15:40] can be trying to influence you with
[1:15:42] pride that's a remember i used that bad
[1:15:44] word here
[1:15:46] i had to apologize to the church i said
[1:15:48] i'm sorry mothers your little kids are
[1:15:50] here but i'm going to use a very bad
[1:15:51] word pride
[1:15:53] see
[1:15:54] and so so because you know the this that
[1:15:58] pride leads to rebellion and rebellions
[1:15:59] witchcraft
[1:16:01] see
[1:16:02] so sometimes that
[1:16:04] that the the that an evil spirit can
[1:16:06] work on on trying to get pride working
[1:16:09] in our mind
[1:16:11] thinking more highly of ourselves than
[1:16:13] is good yeah this is the bible am i in
[1:16:16] the bible
[1:16:17] see you know this you've been hearing
[1:16:19] these verses read i shouldn't have to go
[1:16:20] and read every last one of them to you
[1:16:23] but we but we remember this is always
[1:16:25] the wrong way you remember simon the
[1:16:27] sorcerer you know who he he wanted
[1:16:30] himself as as the great person remember
[1:16:34] that peter dealt with him pretty harshly
[1:16:37] see you remember diotrophies in the in
[1:16:39] the book of acts who wanted preeminence
[1:16:41] among the people and i and i
[1:16:44] i just
[1:16:46] i tell you when i get around to minister
[1:16:48] of the gospel like that and you can see
[1:16:50] that he wants preeminence and domination
[1:16:52] i run from that a thousand miles an hour
[1:16:54] i run away at light speed
[1:16:56] amen i'm i'm not interested in that at
[1:16:59] all ain't going to give any my time to
[1:17:00] that unless i can see a humility in the
[1:17:03] man that believes he's nothing and that
[1:17:04] god is everything
[1:17:06] amen and he's not there to run people's
[1:17:09] lives i'm not here to run your life the
[1:17:11] holy ghost is here to run your life he's
[1:17:14] the pastor of this church
[1:17:17] amen
[1:17:19] diotrophies you know he wanted
[1:17:21] preeminence he resisted the authority of
[1:17:23] the elders of the church and he even
[1:17:25] refused to be corrected by the apostle
[1:17:27] john himself
[1:17:29] see
[1:17:30] you remember the pharisees that jesus
[1:17:32] dealt with who he said love the praises
[1:17:35] of the people they love that praise and
[1:17:37] position among the people and i just say
[1:17:40] to you today run from it
[1:17:42] ministers servants
[1:17:44] people who hold offices the church of
[1:17:46] jesus christ run from that run with all
[1:17:49] your might run run run from that see
[1:17:53] don't go nowhere near that spirit don't
[1:17:56] you have nothing to do
[1:17:58] with that kind of spirit
[1:18:02] so now in our quote that we've got up
[1:18:04] here you know we want you to see
[1:18:06] that that is that this is not dealing so
[1:18:09] much you know with that it's not dealing
[1:18:12] so much with a person under an evil
[1:18:14] influence brother branham is dealing
[1:18:16] here in this quote especially if you go
[1:18:18] listen to it on tape you can hear the
[1:18:19] sincerity in his voice and he's dealing
[1:18:22] with good people who love the lord he's
[1:18:24] not dealing with diagraphies
[1:18:26] he's not dealing with simon or the
[1:18:28] pharisees you're not a pharisee are you
[1:18:30] see so this quote isn't for you then
[1:18:32] this quote
[1:18:33] if if you're a pharisee this quote isn't
[1:18:36] for you
[1:18:37] because brother branham doesn't need to
[1:18:38] correct that jesus already did james
[1:18:41] already did peter already did paul
[1:18:43] already did already told what what
[1:18:45] happened to people who do that see
[1:18:47] and so brother branham here
[1:18:50] jesus you know this is more brother
[1:18:53] branham and a heartfelt concern
[1:18:56] that brother branham has for god's true
[1:18:58] family now you've said you're you're the
[1:19:00] family of god and sometimes you know
[1:19:03] brother branham in trying to deal with
[1:19:04] this because he knows that that god's
[1:19:06] family have good motives
[1:19:10] in desiring the power of god
[1:19:12] we have a good motive in that we have a
[1:19:14] good objective we want to see the enemy
[1:19:15] defeated we want to see healing we want
[1:19:18] to see salvation we want to see the holy
[1:19:20] ghost amen amen
[1:19:22] see i want to see the power of god in
[1:19:24] our young people and our married couples
[1:19:26] and our seniors we want to see the power
[1:19:28] of god moving and see the devil defeated
[1:19:31] see
[1:19:31] and so
[1:19:32] brother branham now is recognizing this
[1:19:35] that that this is can be even among
[1:19:38] god's family
[1:19:40] and um you know
[1:19:42] i mean listen brother branham himself
[1:19:45] admits to liking compliments
[1:19:49] remember the guy you know and uh he
[1:19:51] tried to upgrade brother branham said oh
[1:19:54] you know that man that was complimenting
[1:19:56] you said you know you you was liking
[1:19:58] that too good and brother adam says now
[1:19:59] the only difference between me and you
[1:20:00] sir is i'm honest and you're not
[1:20:05] see the reason you're mad is because you
[1:20:06] want that and you don't get it and if
[1:20:08] you be honest you want it and see and so
[1:20:11] it bugs you that the man didn't say it
[1:20:13] about you brother ram said when you
[1:20:14] can't see your brother blessed of god
[1:20:16] that's a problem with you
[1:20:18] not with god not the brother see
[1:20:22] and so listen friends these are things
[1:20:23] i've seen over over 30 plus years of
[1:20:26] ministry
[1:20:27] and so
[1:20:28] so so so this is now brother branham
[1:20:31] here
[1:20:32] his heart here
[1:20:34] brother branham's heart
[1:20:36] is to try to help honest people
[1:20:39] who honestly just want to be used of god
[1:20:43] amen
[1:20:44] they're not pretentious
[1:20:46] they're they're just misguided on how to
[1:20:49] go about it all right
[1:20:52] now
[1:20:53] um
[1:20:55] yeah i know g thank you
[1:20:57] so
[1:20:58] so so he says here now let's let's carry
[1:21:02] on so they're they're they're not
[1:21:04] pretentious
[1:21:06] they don't have a bad motive they just
[1:21:08] want to serve god and that's great
[1:21:10] that's awesome but now brother branham
[1:21:12] says people want power in a good way
[1:21:15] really they don't know what power is
[1:21:18] watch
[1:21:20] see they don't really know what goes
[1:21:22] with it
[1:21:23] all right you with me
[1:21:25] the way up is down always
[1:21:29] always
[1:21:31] if you want power it's a good thing
[1:21:34] see how humble you can get
[1:21:37] just get away from how much of your
[1:21:39] worldly thinking
[1:21:41] all your worldly thinking
[1:21:44] now that's not just sinful that's your
[1:21:46] flesh anything of your flesh see
[1:21:48] thinking of yourself more highly than is
[1:21:50] good all right get away from all your
[1:21:53] worldly thinking and humble yourself
[1:21:55] before god
[1:21:57] then you've got more power than the man
[1:22:01] that runs all over the building makes a
[1:22:04] big bunch of noise see
[1:22:06] because i love this love this love this
[1:22:08] because you have been able to conquer
[1:22:12] yourself
[1:22:17] you've been able
[1:22:19] to conquer yourself
[1:22:21] and commit yourself to christ
[1:22:25] you see
[1:22:26] to humble yourself before him
[1:22:29] that's
[1:22:30] really
[1:22:31] power amen
[1:22:33] now i want to say this
[1:22:40] humbling oneself
[1:22:44] is not something a human can accomplish
[1:22:46] all on his own
[1:22:49] there's a human involvement
[1:22:51] there's a responsibility of you to do
[1:22:53] your part of it but you should never try
[1:22:56] within yourself alone to accomplish it
[1:22:59] there has to be an acknowledgement of
[1:23:03] god's greatness above you
[1:23:06] see
[1:23:07] see what i mean
[1:23:08] so say oh i acknowledge god's greatness
[1:23:10] above me then why are you always running
[1:23:13] against
[1:23:14] god's timing god's position what god
[1:23:16] wants for your life and you're always
[1:23:17] still trying to put your own self
[1:23:19] forward and then and then when the
[1:23:21] people don't receive you like that then
[1:23:22] then you're offended
[1:23:24] see no one's done anything wrong to you
[1:23:26] they're just they're just being people
[1:23:27] and and and the problem is not in the
[1:23:29] people it's not in god it's in you
[1:23:31] see
[1:23:32] so so it takes a deep
[1:23:35] listen hear me hear me it takes a deep
[1:23:38] you teenagers especially you're young
[1:23:41] i'm trying to help you to not go down
[1:23:43] this road as you grow older
[1:23:45] i want to tell you my years of
[1:23:47] experience have taught me that it takes
[1:23:49] a deep and personal
[1:23:52] surrender that only the power of god can
[1:23:56] enable you to reach
[1:23:59] see
[1:23:59] so humbling yourself isn't just walking
[1:24:03] around speaking in low tones staring at
[1:24:06] your shoes dressed in a potato sack
[1:24:10] and deflecting all compliments
[1:24:13] that's not humility that's that's that's
[1:24:15] man-made nonsense
[1:24:17] see
[1:24:18] all right and so so so you find that
[1:24:21] what it takes is a deeper if you find
[1:24:25] yourself kicking against the pricks of
[1:24:27] god's will for your life you need a
[1:24:29] deeper walk with god
[1:24:31] see
[1:24:32] all right
[1:24:33] so that's what it means to be little
[1:24:37] in your own sight
[1:24:40] to hold a constant vision of him
[1:24:43] before you
[1:24:45] as david did
[1:24:47] that's how that's why david who
[1:24:49] committed some pretty bad infractions
[1:24:52] but god loved him because david stayed
[1:24:56] little in his own sight even though he
[1:24:57] became a king you know how david
[1:24:59] accomplished that he just constantly
[1:25:01] kept the word of god before him
[1:25:04] constantly kept the word in other words
[1:25:07] he constantly stayed in a relationship
[1:25:10] he kept short books with god that's the
[1:25:12] greatest advice i can ever give to
[1:25:14] preachers especially young preachers
[1:25:16] is keep short books
[1:25:18] don't don't make joshua's mistake
[1:25:20] remember joshua he had that great
[1:25:22] victory there and uh you know crossed
[1:25:25] the jordan the waters will stay they
[1:25:27] come in he met he met the the captain of
[1:25:29] the lord's host he sacked jericho
[1:25:32] remember that and then here comes ai
[1:25:34] little bitty city and joshua didn't go
[1:25:36] back and consult god he didn't keep
[1:25:38] short books he just assumed oh we can
[1:25:40] just do this you won't even need the
[1:25:41] whole army just take just take a few
[1:25:42] divisions and you'll crush them anyway
[1:25:44] and got 36 men when they weren't
[1:25:45] supposed to lose a man
[1:25:47] got 36 men killed
[1:25:50] see
[1:25:50] now if he'd have been running short
[1:25:52] books he'd have went back to god and god
[1:25:53] would have said before you can go
[1:25:54] there's sin in the camp
[1:25:56] and 36 daddies would still have been
[1:25:58] alive
[1:26:00] follow me keep short books brothers keep
[1:26:03] short books with the lord check in with
[1:26:05] him constantly don't assume
[1:26:08] don't assume just because you sacked
[1:26:09] that city behind you that this will even
[1:26:11] be done in the same way
[1:26:13] see
[1:26:14] and so so he he kept the lord always
[1:26:17] before him so think of the now listen
[1:26:20] friends david's life i mean if you just
[1:26:22] put yourself there for a minute
[1:26:25] because sometimes we can think about our
[1:26:27] trials and get feeling sorry for
[1:26:28] ourselves and and and think of the
[1:26:31] mental anguish that david must have felt
[1:26:33] hiding in caves who saw dogging his
[1:26:37] every move and and how his mind must
[1:26:40] have been in a world because on you know
[1:26:43] on on on one side he had the promise of
[1:26:46] god through god's prophet that he was
[1:26:49] going to be king
[1:26:50] see now you just imagine that's in his
[1:26:52] mind but here he is in a cave
[1:26:55] and saw dogging is every movement
[1:26:58] i'm going to tell you something
[1:27:00] satan loves to do our lives that way and
[1:27:02] god allows it to see our reaction
[1:27:04] brother branham said god will allow
[1:27:07] things to happen to you on purpose
[1:27:10] just to see your reaction
[1:27:13] see remember i said this last time you
[1:27:16] get mad go off the handle real easy oh i
[1:27:18] just got mad no you didn't
[1:27:21] that was a spirit of anger
[1:27:24] amen see
[1:27:25] that was a spirit of anger say oh you
[1:27:27] know i lusted that just i just come from
[1:27:29] my childhood come from my past come from
[1:27:31] my jeans no no no no that's a spirit
[1:27:34] brother branham said habits are spirits
[1:27:38] see
[1:27:39] so so we find
[1:27:41] we find then that here he is you know
[1:27:44] that that a prophet had told him
[1:27:47] a prophet of god
[1:27:48] who he had confidence in had told david
[1:27:51] that he would that he would stand and
[1:27:53] you know he'd live in a palace with a
[1:27:55] royal crown on his head and royal robes
[1:27:59] clothing his body and yet now here he is
[1:28:02] driven from a quiet life of service into
[1:28:06] the wilderness on the run pursued as a
[1:28:09] criminal and yet in all of that and all
[1:28:12] in all of that
[1:28:13] in what should be a place of total
[1:28:16] despair and bewilderment he kept his
[1:28:19] trust in god amen
[1:28:23] now here he is god had told him thus
[1:28:25] saith lord i'm going to use you in a
[1:28:26] great way and now here he is having to
[1:28:29] flee
[1:28:30] and and he actually ends up having to
[1:28:32] flee to go to the philistines and stands
[1:28:35] before bimelech and has to has to feign
[1:28:37] insanity
[1:28:38] think of the degrading
[1:28:41] that david had to stand there and froth
[1:28:42] at the mouth and act like a crazy man
[1:28:44] and talk out of his head he's one of the
[1:28:46] smartest men in the room
[1:28:48] and he had to stand there before these
[1:28:49] heathen men and obey and and humble
[1:28:51] himself in order to save his life but do
[1:28:54] you know that it was now you think think
[1:28:56] about how bewildering that would be
[1:28:58] you're going to be a king you're going
[1:28:59] to wear a crown you're going to have roy
[1:29:00] robes going to live in a palace and here
[1:29:02] he is feigning insanity in a foreign
[1:29:04] land to a foreign king
[1:29:06] and it's at that exact time that david
[1:29:08] picks up his pen under inspiration
[1:29:11] and says i will bless the lord at all
[1:29:13] times
[1:29:15] how many times all times
[1:29:19] his praise shall be continually in my
[1:29:23] mouth my soul this is while he just left
[1:29:26] abimelech and he's writing my soul shall
[1:29:30] make her boast in the lord the humble
[1:29:33] shall hear thereof and be glad
[1:29:36] here was a man in a in a worse case than
[1:29:39] any of us have ever had and he says
[1:29:41] she's going to be glad she's going to
[1:29:43] humble herself and be glad oh magnify
[1:29:46] the lord with me and let us exalt his
[1:29:48] name together i sought the lord and he
[1:29:51] heard me and delivered me from all my
[1:29:53] fears he didn't look very delivered but
[1:29:55] this is where his faith is see
[1:29:58] i sought the lord and he heard me and
[1:30:00] delivered me from all my fears they
[1:30:02] looked upon him and were lightened and
[1:30:04] their faces were not ashamed this poor
[1:30:07] man cried and the lord heard him and
[1:30:10] saved him out of all of his troubles
[1:30:14] oh that's my life friends this poor man
[1:30:16] cried
[1:30:17] and the lord saved me out of all my
[1:30:20] troubles
[1:30:23] he finally does realize the throne
[1:30:27] say okay trouble's over
[1:30:30] he finally does realize the throne
[1:30:34] only then to allow the greatest failure
[1:30:36] of his life and in that he loses the he
[1:30:39] suffers the loss of his newborn child
[1:30:43] he ends up later deposed by his own son
[1:30:45] absalom who he loved
[1:30:48] you know ends up losing absalom in
[1:30:50] battle
[1:30:51] as as absalom tried to take the throne
[1:30:54] that god had given to david
[1:30:56] he comes to the end of his life now
[1:30:58] watch this
[1:31:00] i
[1:31:01] i think the lord led me into here
[1:31:06] and i'm going to finish up with david i
[1:31:07] want to talk a little bit about joseph
[1:31:10] i think the lord led me here because
[1:31:11] it's it's
[1:31:13] instructive to us
[1:31:15] lest we
[1:31:16] you know unless somebody licks your
[1:31:18] candy
[1:31:20] and you don't like it
[1:31:21] and and you just go
[1:31:23] you just go in into darkness and sit in
[1:31:26] doldrums
[1:31:27] and i just want to say to you
[1:31:29] what happened to you i don't care what
[1:31:31] you say it ain't going to compare to
[1:31:33] this
[1:31:35] it ain't going to compare to this and
[1:31:36] here's the psalm this brother wrote see
[1:31:39] so
[1:31:41] uh
[1:31:42] here he has uh he suffers the loss of a
[1:31:44] newborn child the sword never really
[1:31:46] leaves his house but he comes to the end
[1:31:49] of his life and now here at the end of
[1:31:50] his life
[1:31:52] he's laying on his deathbed you'd think
[1:31:55] surely the lord was let the man die in
[1:31:57] peace for goodness sake he's laying on
[1:31:59] his death bed only to have another son
[1:32:02] try to take the throne by a political
[1:32:05] coup
[1:32:06] and david literally has to come off of
[1:32:08] his death bed and secure solomon as the
[1:32:10] king
[1:32:11] according to his pledge that he made the
[1:32:12] bathsheba see
[1:32:15] and yet
[1:32:16] at that time
[1:32:18] in what most scholars believe a psalm to
[1:32:21] be written at the end of his life he
[1:32:23] pens what we know as the eighth psalm
[1:32:26] give me that eighth psalm g psalms eight
[1:32:29] these first five verses psalms eight one
[1:32:32] to five now catch it this is what he's
[1:32:34] writing
[1:32:35] he comes off his deathbed he can't even
[1:32:38] die in peace and he writes something
[1:32:40] like this
[1:32:42] oh lord
[1:32:43] our lord
[1:32:45] how excellent is thy name in all the
[1:32:48] earth
[1:32:50] amen this is a man who has suffered
[1:32:52] immeasurably but that's his attitude
[1:32:55] see in all the earth who has set thy
[1:32:58] glory above the heavens verse 2 out of
[1:33:01] the mouth of babes and sucklings thou
[1:33:04] hast ordained strength because of thine
[1:33:06] enemies that thou mightest steal the
[1:33:09] enemy and the avenger when i consider
[1:33:12] the heavens the work of thy fingers the
[1:33:15] moon and the stars which thou hast
[1:33:17] ordained what is man
[1:33:19] thou art mindful of him you're so great
[1:33:22] god why are you paying attention to me
[1:33:24] and the son of man that thou visites him
[1:33:27] for thou has made him a little lower
[1:33:29] than the angels and has crowned him with
[1:33:31] glory and honor
[1:33:34] now this is david's idea about god
[1:33:38] because one thing that you need to
[1:33:39] understand friends is when you look
[1:33:41] there in verse 3 gideon put that back
[1:33:44] verse 3 when i consider thy heavens the
[1:33:47] work of thy fingers
[1:33:50] so it was it was literally as easy for
[1:33:53] god to create the heavens as it is for a
[1:33:56] human being to make something with his
[1:33:58] fingers rather than needing to use his
[1:34:00] arm
[1:34:01] just something you can just do with your
[1:34:02] little fingers that's all it was to god
[1:34:05] to make all the heavens and all the
[1:34:06] galaxies and all the universes it was
[1:34:09] just a little finger of god on the move
[1:34:11] see
[1:34:12] and so this is why
[1:34:15] that in contrast
[1:34:17] to god
[1:34:18] the heavens are tiny
[1:34:20] and they're they're the the commentators
[1:34:23] say
[1:34:24] they're so tiny that they were
[1:34:26] pushed and prodded into shape just by
[1:34:29] his divine digits
[1:34:32] see
[1:34:33] now that's how great he is
[1:34:35] that's how powerful he is that's how
[1:34:38] much
[1:34:39] that's how much higher he is than you
[1:34:41] and i see
[1:34:43] and so
[1:34:44] if we if you know think of the heavens
[1:34:47] then how that god has created with just
[1:34:50] his fingers
[1:34:51] if we really dwelt i'm going to tell you
[1:34:53] something friends
[1:34:54] if you really dwell on the vision of his
[1:34:57] greatness
[1:34:59] the vision of his mightiness then i'm
[1:35:01] here to tell you you would never fail to
[1:35:04] have faith no matter what the crisis
[1:35:07] that satan brought your way
[1:35:10] all you got to do is consider him stop
[1:35:14] looking at your dilemma look at him
[1:35:18] see
[1:35:19] see we'd see him as isaiah did you'd see
[1:35:23] the lord high and lifted up watching to
[1:35:27] see our reaction
[1:35:30] ready to move on behalf of his promises
[1:35:33] to us so it depends on
[1:35:36] what
[1:35:37] you're looking at
[1:35:40] see
[1:35:41] i can promise you the devil won't want
[1:35:43] you to look toward the heavens
[1:35:45] he won't want you to think about the
[1:35:47] majesty of god he'll want you to think
[1:35:49] about your own
[1:35:51] narrow little self
[1:35:53] and what happened to you see
[1:35:55] and that if he can get you there then
[1:35:56] he's got you defeated you'll you'll
[1:35:59] you'll never be able to serve god see
[1:36:01] because god can't even trust you
[1:36:03] he can't even trust you see man it can't
[1:36:06] control his own spirit god can't even
[1:36:08] trust him see watch
[1:36:10] so we love god amen
[1:36:13] amen amen amen
[1:36:15] see sometimes you know we're we're we're
[1:36:18] you you've got to look at god you've got
[1:36:20] to look away as brother branham said
[1:36:22] look away to jesus
[1:36:24] because you can look at your problem or
[1:36:26] you can look at what at david's god
[1:36:28] that's really your choices you can look
[1:36:30] at your problem your circumstance or you
[1:36:32] can look at david's god
[1:36:34] what's your choice today see
[1:36:36] sometimes we are found in his presence
[1:36:38] not worshiping as we should
[1:36:41] or not joyous as we should be now
[1:36:44] i'm gonna i'm gonna give you some help
[1:36:46] here because boy did this ever help me
[1:36:48] i'm gonna i'm gonna give you another
[1:36:50] side of it you ready
[1:36:52] all right
[1:36:53] we love god
[1:36:56] don't we
[1:36:57] we believe his word
[1:37:00] amen
[1:37:02] yeah we got problems i got a ton of them
[1:37:04] we got ups and downs constantly
[1:37:06] ins and outs on and off faith and fear
[1:37:09] word
[1:37:11] amen me guilty
[1:37:14] guilty
[1:37:15] see
[1:37:16] and so
[1:37:18] you know but we love god
[1:37:21] sometimes
[1:37:23] in this mad world
[1:37:26] we can find ourselves sitting
[1:37:29] unable
[1:37:31] to stand
[1:37:32] broken
[1:37:34] looking to the heavens
[1:37:36] and crying
[1:37:38] because the last thing i want to present
[1:37:40] in this sermon
[1:37:41] is to present you with the idea that no
[1:37:43] one should ever be sad
[1:37:46] or that no one should ever feel
[1:37:47] depressed
[1:37:48] i must not be a christian because i feel
[1:37:50] sad i feel depressed i i whereas my
[1:37:52] faith is weak my joy is gone i must not
[1:37:55] be a christian that's that's just what
[1:37:56] the devil would want you to believe see
[1:38:01] sometimes our wounds can be so great
[1:38:02] friends now listen
[1:38:04] sometimes your fellow brothers and
[1:38:06] sisters
[1:38:07] their wounds their their afflictions can
[1:38:09] be so great
[1:38:10] and they they can find themselves just
[1:38:12] as you can find yourself just as i can
[1:38:14] find myself and have
[1:38:16] unable to stand broken looking to the
[1:38:19] heavens and crying
[1:38:21] where is my joy of the lord
[1:38:25] come on all you holy people
[1:38:27] is that right
[1:38:30] where has all my strength gone
[1:38:33] sometimes
[1:38:35] we can see other people in this kind of
[1:38:37] shape and think oh it's just pride it's
[1:38:39] stubbornness before god
[1:38:41] but it may not be that at all amen
[1:38:45] see
[1:38:47] the lord help me to think about it in
[1:38:48] this way
[1:38:51] because a lot of times what you see you
[1:38:52] can be affected by it
[1:38:55] and you you see someone with a certain
[1:38:57] attitude and you just then your reaction
[1:38:59] is worse than theirs
[1:39:00] see
[1:39:01] and the lord the lord came to me at one
[1:39:03] of those 5 30 in the morning with me
[1:39:05] sitting in my chair in my living room in
[1:39:07] the darkness you hear me tell that a lot
[1:39:09] so
[1:39:10] it's how i start every day
[1:39:16] and the lord said
[1:39:18] okay let me change the picture
[1:39:20] i'm just going to flip the picture on
[1:39:22] you and i said okay lord what's the
[1:39:24] picture
[1:39:26] and the lord said what if a person came
[1:39:28] into church
[1:39:30] in a wheelchair
[1:39:32] they were paraplegic
[1:39:35] and they came in
[1:39:37] and the whole church was standing to
[1:39:38] their feet and praises to god and they
[1:39:41] couldn't stand
[1:39:46] would you feel
[1:39:48] animosity
[1:39:50] disdain
[1:39:51] would you feel
[1:39:52] contempt no you wouldn't
[1:39:55] you know what you'd do you'd feel
[1:39:56] compassion
[1:39:58] you'd feel empathy you'd you'd want
[1:40:00] you'd pray you'd want to pray oh god
[1:40:02] heal that sister heal that brother this
[1:40:05] is was the success of william branham
[1:40:08] this is why he was so successful that he
[1:40:11] had a love for god and god's family and
[1:40:14] he was determined he was the enemy of
[1:40:16] satan see
[1:40:18] and and the lord said let's go a little
[1:40:20] further and i was already crying and and
[1:40:23] the lord said what if they come in and
[1:40:25] they're not a they're not a paraplegic
[1:40:27] they're a quadriplegic
[1:40:29] they can't stand they can't even raise
[1:40:31] their hands
[1:40:33] and here you're saying raise up your
[1:40:34] hand stand your feet and praise the lord
[1:40:36] what if they're a deaf mute and they
[1:40:38] can't praise the lord they can't stand
[1:40:41] they're on a machine that's just
[1:40:42] breathing for them yeah
[1:40:45] or oh but they're in the house of god
[1:40:48] they come to hear the word because
[1:40:49] they're a christian
[1:40:51] amen
[1:40:52] amen
[1:40:53] listen brothers what we should have
[1:40:55] brothers and sisters don't let the enemy
[1:40:58] change your thinking we should have
[1:41:00] compassion for one another we should
[1:41:03] have faith for one another we should
[1:41:05] pray for one another hallelujah because
[1:41:08] sometimes the affliction or the wound or
[1:41:11] the damage it might not be in their
[1:41:14] flesh it might be in their spirit
[1:41:18] and it's unseen you can't see the wound
[1:41:20] you can't see the crippled condition but
[1:41:22] it's there and it's just as real as the
[1:41:24] flesh i tell you that's the time when we
[1:41:27] need to pray and say god help my brother
[1:41:30] help my sister and help me
[1:41:34] hallelujah
[1:41:37] we wouldn't judge them
[1:41:40] we'd have compassion we'd see broken
[1:41:42] condition and our hearts would go out to
[1:41:44] them what if it was a sinner
[1:41:47] what if it was an unbeliever who's
[1:41:49] trapped in the disease of sin and wants
[1:41:52] to be free and isn't free and they come
[1:41:54] into the house of god i understand we've
[1:41:56] got to have church order i understand we
[1:41:58] can't let people be indecent i
[1:42:00] understand we've had to send women home
[1:42:02] before ask them to cover up because
[1:42:03] they're indecent we'll always do that
[1:42:05] but i'm not talking about that i'm
[1:42:07] talking about where's our attitude what
[1:42:09] about our teenagers who don't have the
[1:42:10] holy ghost yet what about they're still
[1:42:12] struggling what about marriages and god
[1:42:14] needs to do something in there we should
[1:42:17] be praying we should be loving we should
[1:42:20] be caring we should have compassion
[1:42:24] this is a hospital that's kingdom order
[1:42:29] that's when you're a servant of god
[1:42:33] see
[1:42:35] see what if the affliction is something
[1:42:37] you can't see buried way down in the
[1:42:39] human spirit they need healing of a deep
[1:42:42] wound or some great loss
[1:42:44] where's our compassion then where's our
[1:42:46] burden of prayer
[1:42:48] see
[1:42:50] where's the desire to encourage their
[1:42:52] faith to accept god's healing
[1:42:54] you might be dealing with a child of god
[1:42:57] one for whom christ died a child that
[1:42:59] god wants free from sickness this is not
[1:43:02] a pharisee this isn't diotrophies
[1:43:05] this isn't this this isn't simon the
[1:43:07] sorcerer this is god's family that's the
[1:43:10] line in order of god's word
[1:43:13] this is what makes us servants my
[1:43:16] you know the sinner we should have a
[1:43:18] brother branham even talks about the
[1:43:19] prostitute on the street he said how do
[1:43:21] you know but she might just need a
[1:43:22] handshake and an invitation to church
[1:43:25] see makes people uncomfortable when you
[1:43:27] start reminding them of quotes like that
[1:43:30] what about mary magdalene seven devils
[1:43:32] on that girl
[1:43:33] amen
[1:43:34] what about the woman washing his feet
[1:43:37] and jesus said to her
[1:43:39] i say he said it publicly he didn't hide
[1:43:41] it she didn't get offended because he
[1:43:43] said it he said i say to you that her
[1:43:46] sins which are many
[1:43:49] are
[1:43:51] forgiven her
[1:43:53] they're all
[1:43:55] forgiving her i just want him to say
[1:43:56] that about me
[1:43:58] jason your sins which are many they're
[1:44:00] all forgiving you thank you lord
[1:44:04] thank you lord hallelujah
[1:44:06] your presence is my greatest gift of all
[1:44:10] oh my oh
[1:44:13] see
[1:44:14] the the bible actually when it when it
[1:44:17] says there he made him a little lower
[1:44:18] than the angels it actually says in in
[1:44:20] the in the hebrew text if you read it
[1:44:22] from the hebrew text it's saying you
[1:44:24] have made him uh you have made him to
[1:44:27] lack little of god
[1:44:30] see
[1:44:30] because remember you're built in the
[1:44:32] image of god
[1:44:34] and you lack very little
[1:44:37] from being god
[1:44:39] god made you in his own image
[1:44:42] and gave you a soul
[1:44:44] see
[1:44:44] and so
[1:44:46] think of how vulnerable
[1:44:49] that you are being created at this level
[1:44:52] but born in sin
[1:44:54] you see that
[1:44:56] i'll say it again think of how
[1:44:58] vulnerable the devil knows you are
[1:45:00] born at this lofty level but born in sin
[1:45:04] see
[1:45:05] i think it was brother uh
[1:45:07] matthew that preached
[1:45:10] uh about how that you know a man without
[1:45:12] the holy ghost he's just a brood he's
[1:45:14] just an animal he's one of the most
[1:45:15] dangerous
[1:45:16] enemies of the cross there is because
[1:45:18] he's built in the image of god
[1:45:20] but yet a man who's born again of the
[1:45:22] spirit of god is the greatest asset in
[1:45:23] the hand of god see
[1:45:25] and so so you got to know that the devil
[1:45:29] will surely capitalize on this reality
[1:45:32] you you need to know that and take steps
[1:45:35] to prevent his movement in and out of
[1:45:37] your life
[1:45:39] this is where you're humbling yourself
[1:45:41] humbling yourself isn't just a mental
[1:45:43] gymnastic humbling yourself is
[1:45:45] eliminating out of your life anything
[1:45:48] that would hinder the movement of god in
[1:45:50] your life that's humbling yourself see
[1:45:54] and you know this is why that we see god
[1:45:58] moving in this way
[1:46:01] now i want to take my last 10 minutes i
[1:46:03] want to come to joseph
[1:46:05] you got 10 minutes
[1:46:10] you know
[1:46:11] your love
[1:46:13] and all your loyalty
[1:46:15] should be to the lord god of heavens and
[1:46:17] earth
[1:46:18] at all times
[1:46:20] you know joseph from a very young man
[1:46:22] now you young men especially you senior
[1:46:25] youth young men you pay close attention
[1:46:27] to this
[1:46:29] joseph
[1:46:31] decided from a very early age
[1:46:34] that his life
[1:46:36] should be loyal to jehovah
[1:46:39] above all else
[1:46:42] and
[1:46:43] he did not attach
[1:46:45] joseph did not attach his hope of life
[1:46:48] merely to other human beings above god
[1:46:50] he never did that see
[1:46:52] humans will disappoint you
[1:46:54] amen
[1:46:55] no matter who they are
[1:46:58] amen
[1:47:00] intentionally or unintentionally see
[1:47:03] they are fraught with errors and
[1:47:05] weakness
[1:47:07] and the the human most likely
[1:47:10] to disappoint you
[1:47:12] will be yes
[1:47:14] you
[1:47:17] the human most likely to disappoint you
[1:47:21] the one that stares back at you when you
[1:47:24] stand in front of the mirror and unless
[1:47:26] you can see and acknowledge from the
[1:47:30] deepest realms of your soul that that
[1:47:34] guy in the mirror is filled with
[1:47:36] weakness and errors
[1:47:39] failure and constant disappointment
[1:47:41] await you
[1:47:43] unless you can see that god for who he
[1:47:46] really is failure and constant
[1:47:48] disappointment await you see
[1:47:52] joseph and then it'll it'll it'll follow
[1:47:55] you all of your life friends it'll
[1:47:56] follow you
[1:47:58] you know unless you can acknowledge
[1:47:59] unless you can acknowledge that you need
[1:48:02] god
[1:48:03] unless you can allow
[1:48:06] permit because he won't force himself
[1:48:09] unless you can allow
[1:48:11] the holy ghost now the holy spirit to
[1:48:15] keep you humble and and and keep you
[1:48:17] little in your own sight then that man
[1:48:20] in the mirror will torment you
[1:48:22] throughout your entire life you'll never
[1:48:24] be free
[1:48:26] of the ups and downs that he will cause
[1:48:28] you
[1:48:30] joseph
[1:48:32] even when his own blood brothers
[1:48:36] even when his own blood father and his
[1:48:38] own blood mother scorned him he never
[1:48:42] allowed it to darken his heart toward
[1:48:45] them amen
[1:48:47] he never stopped
[1:48:49] magnifying god before all men
[1:48:53] he never stopped doing that he never
[1:48:56] became bitter i'm leaping over his whole
[1:48:58] life i'm not going to deal in the in the
[1:49:00] trenches with it
[1:49:01] but you know the story you've read it
[1:49:03] from sunday school he was cast into
[1:49:04] prison on a false charge from potiphar's
[1:49:07] wife he never became bitter
[1:49:10] never
[1:49:12] even toward his fellow prisoners who
[1:49:14] disappointed him
[1:49:15] let him down broke their word to him
[1:49:18] abandon him leaving him you know uh in
[1:49:20] into rot in prison
[1:49:23] he never allowed his heart to darken
[1:49:26] even towards the egyptians that evilly
[1:49:29] mistreated him you know you see all the
[1:49:31] time that men who get treated wrong and
[1:49:32] then they come into political power then
[1:49:34] they go on a revenge track and get all
[1:49:35] their enemies
[1:49:37] joseph never did that these people lied
[1:49:39] on him put him in prison and it was
[1:49:41] their own ungodliness he never when he
[1:49:44] became the right-hand man to pharaoh he
[1:49:46] never went on a political revenge hunt
[1:49:48] when he came into power he and he never
[1:49:51] ever blamed god
[1:49:54] for any of his undeserved misfortunes
[1:49:59] like job of old
[1:50:00] he did everything right
[1:50:02] conducted himself correctly before men
[1:50:04] yet everything in his world
[1:50:07] turned out wrong
[1:50:10] his heart joseph's heart
[1:50:13] stayed perfect
[1:50:15] toward god
[1:50:16] toward his family
[1:50:18] toward his enemies see
[1:50:21] when he when he when he was reunited
[1:50:24] with his brethren
[1:50:25] it was genuine tears of joy even
[1:50:28] thinking what they had did to him
[1:50:31] he's standing there weeping when they
[1:50:33] know it's him he already knows it's them
[1:50:35] when they know it's him they think we're
[1:50:37] dead joseph's like no
[1:50:39] he's already been thinking about this
[1:50:42] this wasn't something he tried to push
[1:50:43] out of his mind i gotta i gotta stop
[1:50:45] thinking about what i did to me i'm
[1:50:46] gonna execute him i'm second man to
[1:50:48] pharaoh no he actually thought about
[1:50:50] what they did and he said this was god's
[1:50:53] doing
[1:50:54] he did it to preserve life i'm joseph
[1:50:57] your brother
[1:51:00] oh my what did he do friends he knew
[1:51:04] it was all the love of god and he saw
[1:51:07] the grander purpose he continually
[1:51:10] humbled himself to it at every point in
[1:51:13] his sad life
[1:51:16] his words to his brothers
[1:51:18] god did it
[1:51:20] see it was a revelation
[1:51:23] it was a revelation to joseph i'm here
[1:51:25] to tell you that that revelation
[1:51:28] it had to be an unfolding comfort over
[1:51:30] time
[1:51:31] that no matter i don't i don't think
[1:51:34] that joseph is standing there and he's
[1:51:36] been thinking about i'm gonna get him
[1:51:38] and suddenly he gets a revelation oh god
[1:51:40] you did that for good oh never mind i'm
[1:51:42] not gonna kill you i think joseph all
[1:51:45] through
[1:51:46] his torment was going this is the hand
[1:51:48] of god this is the hand of god i will
[1:51:51] glorify god i will not let my heart i
[1:51:54] will not let my mind become darkened see
[1:51:57] now
[1:51:58] no mortal can accomplish this on their
[1:52:02] own this was only possible by as a young
[1:52:05] man
[1:52:07] joseph made a decision to direct his
[1:52:10] whole heart to the love of god above all
[1:52:15] other things
[1:52:18] see
[1:52:19] and that
[1:52:20] kept his heart clean
[1:52:22] it kept his spirit pure and it kept his
[1:52:25] faith strong
[1:52:27] when all around him even his closest
[1:52:30] family and friends failed and stumbled
[1:52:32] in their human weakness
[1:52:34] joseph remained victorious and conquered
[1:52:37] himself
[1:52:40] so that he could remain and
[1:52:43] to god
[1:52:45] amen
[1:52:48] let me come to the end here i've got
[1:52:50] more than i can cover and i need to stop
[1:52:57] this is why the psalms
[1:53:00] are so good
[1:53:02] for use in teaching on human emotions
[1:53:04] and human affairs
[1:53:06] of life they offer such
[1:53:09] sure
[1:53:10] guidance
[1:53:12] sometimes we can get in a in a set of
[1:53:15] very confusing circumstances
[1:53:18] and the psalms david psalms you know
[1:53:20] david you know what david you know
[1:53:22] another thing david psalms do they they
[1:53:23] show his ups and downs
[1:53:26] like we all have amen
[1:53:28] amen
[1:53:29] yet they also show his ability
[1:53:32] to abide in his deep relationship with
[1:53:35] god
[1:53:37] no matter what
[1:53:39] was happening in his life
[1:53:42] what they show
[1:53:43] is the difference between complaining
[1:53:45] about god like israel did in the
[1:53:46] wilderness
[1:53:48] and pouring out your heart to god in
[1:53:50] total honesty
[1:53:52] because this pouring out of your heart i
[1:53:54] want to read a statement for a scripture
[1:53:57] because this pouring out of your heart
[1:53:59] may include your pain
[1:54:02] your fears
[1:54:04] your frustrations
[1:54:06] real or imagined
[1:54:08] doesn't matter whether it's imagined
[1:54:10] perception is reality to the person
[1:54:12] see
[1:54:14] and so
[1:54:15] the pouring out of your heart may
[1:54:17] include your pain your fears your
[1:54:20] frustrations
[1:54:21] but because listen don't feel bad
[1:54:23] because even jesus
[1:54:25] who in the days of his flesh hebrews 5 7
[1:54:28] even jesus who in the days of his flesh
[1:54:31] when he had offered up prayers and
[1:54:33] supplications with strong crying and
[1:54:35] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:54:38] from death and was heard in that he
[1:54:41] feared
[1:54:43] so don't let the devil beat you up over
[1:54:45] that see
[1:54:46] even jesus himself but in the pouring
[1:54:49] out to god in prayer about our
[1:54:51] circumstances we still uh we we must
[1:54:54] still be willing to worship him and
[1:54:57] acknowledge his goodness
[1:55:00] acknowledge his goodness i've seen some
[1:55:02] people who blame god tragedies in their
[1:55:04] childhood tragedies in their life and
[1:55:06] you can see that they're angry at god
[1:55:09] it's never been god trying to hurt you
[1:55:11] that's the devil trying to do that it's
[1:55:13] been god trying to help you
[1:55:15] it's been god trying to save you all of
[1:55:18] this time see
[1:55:21] see we never find fault in god or his
[1:55:24] plan for our growth however painful
[1:55:27] however fearful however frustrating it
[1:55:30] may seem he is still in control
[1:55:34] [Applause]
[1:55:35] hallelujah
[1:55:38] now i want to give you this closing this
[1:55:40] closing thought
[1:55:41] i made this and i said it in a different
[1:55:43] way last time i want to say it again but
[1:55:44] in a different way your situation
[1:55:46] according to the scriptures
[1:55:50] your situation will endure
[1:55:53] don't bother asking me to pray you out
[1:55:55] of it it'll keep going
[1:55:58] until you accept his plan for you
[1:56:02] you'll never know peace as a son of god
[1:56:05] until you can accept his plan from you
[1:56:08] you know
[1:56:09] you either need to accept his plan or or
[1:56:11] maybe you have a needed adjustment i
[1:56:13] don't know maybe there's a needed
[1:56:15] adjustment that that that lays within
[1:56:18] the lesson that he's trying to teach you
[1:56:21] you know he he's trying to help you
[1:56:24] that's my message today for those who
[1:56:26] want to be a servant it ain't always
[1:56:28] going to be a bed of roses you're going
[1:56:29] to come up into chaotic and
[1:56:32] a lot of times not understand why does
[1:56:34] it have to go this way just remember
[1:56:36] he's trying to help you he's trying to
[1:56:38] grow you past your weaknesses in your
[1:56:41] flesh weaknesses in your mind weaknesses
[1:56:43] in your spirit he's leading you to
[1:56:46] believe him for
[1:56:48] all
[1:56:49] things
[1:56:50] amen see
[1:56:54] now i'll just i'll just close by saying
[1:56:58] this
[1:57:00] here's where i've had
[1:57:02] me
[1:57:04] here has been where i brother jason
[1:57:08] have have had to spend the greatest
[1:57:10] amount of time on the potter's wheel
[1:57:15] my whole life
[1:57:17] see
[1:57:18] because i uh you know it is is
[1:57:21] as you say what what's been your
[1:57:23] greatest need trusting him
[1:57:25] for things that i can't do is never a
[1:57:27] problem for me when i can't do it
[1:57:30] see
[1:57:32] but but always trying to take control
[1:57:35] when it's something i'm good at or
[1:57:38] something i can do see
[1:57:40] and and and i want to accomplish
[1:57:42] accomplish something that doesn't fit
[1:57:45] the direction that he has planned out
[1:57:47] for me
[1:57:50] you preachers remember that one i'm just
[1:57:52] telling you as a seasoned veteran i i
[1:57:54] preached out here at phoenix at a
[1:57:56] minister's meeting and they had two
[1:57:57] preachers in the morning they were going
[1:57:58] to use an elder minister and a younger
[1:58:00] minister and they said brother jason
[1:58:01] you're going first and i said when did i
[1:58:03] become an elder and i said i i still
[1:58:05] feel like a kid oh no brother jason i'm
[1:58:07] like okay well i guess i'm i got seven
[1:58:10] grandkids i guess that makes me elder i
[1:58:12] don't know when i became elder
[1:58:15] but i did
[1:58:19] so listen to your elder
[1:58:20] i'm telling you from experience through
[1:58:22] real transparency that's where i've
[1:58:25] gotten in trouble
[1:58:26] more than a few times see
[1:58:29] i've had to learn this the hard way too
[1:58:32] many times so you know what i do i
[1:58:35] humble myself much quicker than i used
[1:58:37] to
[1:58:39] i learn fast these days
[1:58:41] i make my vows to god
[1:58:43] not to lean
[1:58:44] on the arm of flesh and especially
[1:58:47] definitely not mine but to put my trust
[1:58:51] in him

[2:00:27] real believer could say i haven't made
[2:00:29] my case in the word of god today i think
[2:00:32] that i have made a sound open and shut
[2:00:35] case that there is a way to go forward
[2:00:38] to be a servant of god
