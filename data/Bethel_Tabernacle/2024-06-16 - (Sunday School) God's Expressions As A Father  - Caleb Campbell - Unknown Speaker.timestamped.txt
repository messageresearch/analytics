[6:44] read the whole chapter this morning Ruth
[6:47] chapter
[6:48] 3 give you a second to turn
[6:52] there Ruth chter 3 and verse one it says
[6:55] then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto
[6:57] her my daughter shall I not seek rest
[7:00] for thee that it may be well with thee
[7:03] and now is not Boaz of our Kindred with
[7:06] whose maidens thou W behold he went with
[7:09] barley to night in the threshing floor
[7:12] wash thyself therefore and anoint thee
[7:15] and put thy reignment upon thee and get
[7:18] thee down to the floor but make not
[7:21] thyself known unto the man until he
[7:22] shall have done eating and drinking and
[7:25] it shall be when he lieth down that thou
[7:28] shalt Mark the place where he he shall
[7:29] lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his
[7:32] feet and lay thee down and he will tell
[7:34] thee what Thou shalt do and she said
[7:37] unto her all thou sayest unto me I will
[7:39] do and she went down unto the floor and
[7:43] did according to all that her
[7:44] mother-in-law bade her and when Boaz had
[7:47] eaten and drunk and his heart was merry
[7:49] he went to lie down at the end of the
[7:51] Heap of corn and she came softly and
[7:54] uncovered his feet and laid her down and
[7:56] it came to pass at midnight that the man
[7:58] was afraid and turned himself and behold
[8:01] a woman lay at his feet and he said who
[8:03] art thou and she answered I am Ruth thy
[8:06] handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over
[8:08] thine handmaid for thou art a near
[8:11] Kinsman and he said blessed be thou the
[8:14] Lord my daughter for thou Hast showed me
[8:17] more kindness in the latter end than at
[8:20] the beginning in as much as thou follow
[8:22] us not young men whether poor nor rich
[8:25] and now my daughter fear not I will do
[8:27] to thee all that thou requirest for all
[8:28] the city of my people doth know that
[8:30] thou art a virtuous woman and now it is
[8:33] true that I am thy near Kinsman how be
[8:36] it there is a Kinsman nearer than I
[8:38] terar tarry this night and it shall be
[8:40] in the morning that if he will perform
[8:42] unto thee the part of a Kinsman well let
[8:44] him do the Kinsman part but if he will
[8:46] not do the part of a Kinsman to thee
[8:48] then will I do the part of a Kinsman to
[8:50] thee as the Lord liveth lie down until
[8:52] the morning and she lay down in his feet
[8:54] until the morning and she rose up before
[8:56] one could know another and he said let
[8:58] it not be known that a woman came under
[9:00] the floor also he said bring the veil
[9:04] that thou Hast upon thee and hold it
[9:06] when she held it he measured six
[9:07] measures of barley and laid it on her
[9:09] and she went into the City and when she
[9:11] came to her mother-in-law she said who
[9:12] art thou my daughter and she told her
[9:14] all the man had done unto her and she
[9:16] said these six measures of barley gave
[9:18] you me and he said unto me go not empty
[9:20] unto thy mother-in-law then said she sit
[9:24] still my daughter until thou know how
[9:26] the matter will fall for the man will
[9:28] not be in rest until he has finished the
[9:31] thing this day God bless you as you take
[9:34] your seats this morning the um the title
[9:37] that I'm taking this morning is God's
[9:40] Expressions as a father amen I actually
[9:43] I got inspiration for this topic
[9:45] Sometime Late last year but uh you know
[9:47] when the Lord lays something on my heart
[9:50] I put a note in there and I just wait
[9:51] until he opens it up to me and and it
[9:53] seems that he opened it up to me for
[9:55] today which how appropriate on Father's
[9:57] Day amen you know so there's a few men
[10:01] as that was a foundation this morning so
[10:02] there's a few men I want to look at in
[10:04] in the Bible this morning that
[10:05] especially stuck out to me as as in
[10:08] their character as fathers you know uh
[10:11] you go read the book of Ruth and and you
[10:13] watch this man by the name of Boaz and
[10:17] you see this incredible story of
[10:20] redemption amen Ruth was a moabit woman
[10:24] and the moabites if we remember from
[10:26] history they were a descendant of lot
[10:29] when lot and his two daughters had left
[10:32] left out of Sodom they had just escaped
[10:34] Sodom you know they watched they watched
[10:36] their mother turned to salt and and they
[10:38] were scared into thinking that there
[10:40] wasn't going to be any men around to be
[10:42] able to marry and and to have them
[10:44] conceed children so they plotted this
[10:46] deceptive plan amen they got with their
[10:49] father they got him drunk and they laid
[10:51] with their father in his drunkenness and
[10:54] there was two children born from that
[10:57] circumstance it was Ammon and Moab and
[11:00] the Nations that came out of that were
[11:02] the ammonites and the moabites and they
[11:05] both grew to be these Pagan Godless
[11:08] Nations um you know one of one of some
[11:12] of the history of Moab that we can
[11:14] recall if you go and read in numbers you
[11:17] know is the story of the prophet balum
[11:19] and and we've talked about that here
[11:21] before king the king of Moab at the time
[11:23] was King baac and if you're familiar
[11:26] King baac he was scared because the
[11:29] Israelites had grown great in their
[11:31] battle in their victories and so he had
[11:34] gotten scared about all those victories
[11:36] so he actually called that Prophet balum
[11:39] into into the country of Moab and he
[11:41] wanted him to prophesy against the
[11:44] Israelites amen because he was scared
[11:45] that they were going to overthrow him in
[11:47] his nation and he was desperately trying
[11:51] to get it this Prophet to balum to to
[11:53] curse Israel you know and so you go and
[11:55] you read these things Moab didn't have a
[11:58] good history amen Moab was you think
[12:01] about it there's so many negative
[12:03] aspects to the country of Moab how how
[12:06] could anything good come from this
[12:08] country how could anything good from it
[12:10] you you think back when you know even a
[12:12] similar circumstance you think about
[12:14] anything good coming from something so
[12:16] evil even Nathaniel when he went and
[12:17] asked philli he he asked that question
[12:19] about Jesus can anything good come out
[12:22] of Nazareth that broken place but it was
[12:25] done for that purpose amen it was done
[12:27] that way for a purpose
[12:29] you know the Pharisees might have caught
[12:31] what was happening if they would have
[12:33] read between the lines of the scriptures
[12:35] and read between the lines of things God
[12:38] wasn't going to come some polished way
[12:41] he was there to give hope to the
[12:43] Hopeless amen and we're so glad for that
[12:46] so getting back to Ruth you know Naomi
[12:49] when Naomi returned from the land of
[12:51] Moab with her daughter-in-law that was
[12:53] widowed the history of that Nation
[12:56] followed her in her name everywhere she
[12:59] went she was always referred to as Ruth
[13:01] the moabit right the title followed her
[13:04] because of where she came from but you
[13:06] see this man Boaz Boaz had a father by
[13:11] the name of Salon amen and the wife of
[13:14] Salon also had a title that followed her
[13:18] for a long time amen hers was even a
[13:21] little bit worse you go back and you
[13:22] read the story of Rahab Rahab was a
[13:25] harlot that lived in the city in a in a
[13:27] city of desolation that was was going to
[13:29] be destroyed by uh by Joshua and all of
[13:33] those soldiers but there was a woman in
[13:35] that place by the name of Rahab amen and
[13:39] she had that title that followed her for
[13:41] a time but then there came a man named
[13:43] salon and salmon wasn't worried about
[13:46] the titles that was in her past amen God
[13:48] God brought to him a wife that was a
[13:51] virtuous woman not not virtue of of her
[13:54] past but what he could redeem amen what
[13:57] he could make new and cleanse and clean
[14:00] amen and that's all of us today amen we
[14:02] all come from a broken past we all come
[14:04] from Brokenness in some way some shape
[14:07] some form but God was able to take us
[14:09] out of that thing and he was able to
[14:11] redeem us into something new amen and
[14:14] you know when the opportunity came to
[14:17] Boaz to redeem Ruth this widow or what
[14:21] the world would call maybe unwanted you
[14:23] know a foreigner in a Strange Land and
[14:26] you you see that even clearly when Boaz
[14:30] in the fourth chapter of Ruth goes and
[14:32] he meets this near Kinsman that near
[14:35] Kinsman reacted when Boaz presented him
[14:38] with this opportunity he he I don't even
[14:40] I don't know if it says his name or not
[14:42] but he he says you know you have this
[14:44] opportunity you're the nearest Kinsman
[14:46] and you're going to be able to have this
[14:47] land and you're going to have this
[14:48] opportunity to have more wealth in your
[14:51] name and he wanted the land and he
[14:53] wanted the wealth but he wasn't willing
[14:55] to give up his own life and his own
[14:57] inheritance and share it with this woman
[15:00] from Moab you remember you're familiar
[15:02] with that story but that didn't matter
[15:04] to
[15:05] Boaz Boaz had a father named salon and
[15:09] Salon was also a man was that was
[15:12] presented with a similar opportunity
[15:14] that he was amen just a few decades
[15:17] earlier salmon was a man who had stood
[15:20] with Joshua during those times and when
[15:22] it came time to conquer that city of
[15:25] Jericho you know there was one in that
[15:28] City who God called out of that thing
[15:31] amen God called one out of that place
[15:35] and he and he gave her this this new
[15:38] title amen he gave her this this lineage
[15:41] amen the lineage of Christ came from her
[15:43] amen and it was it wasn't it wasn't
[15:46] because of her past it wasn't because of
[15:48] where she was it was because God
[15:50] ordained it to be that way
[15:52] amen you know and just because she held
[15:56] a certain title for a portion of her
[15:58] life life that title did
[16:02] not did not bring her or or hold her
[16:05] back from what God was calling her to be
[16:08] amen it didn't Define who she was amen
[16:13] God saved her and her family all of her
[16:16] family it says out of the destruction of
[16:18] that City and eventually the scripture
[16:20] says that she fell in love and married
[16:22] this man by the name of Boaz and by her
[16:25] they had a son and that son's name was
[16:27] Boaz glory to God God watch you watch
[16:30] these things and you watch how God is
[16:33] expressing his character through these
[16:36] men amen I believe that salmon must have
[16:39] taught Boaz about the love story of him
[16:42] and his precious bride and how God
[16:44] brought him together in the Supernatural
[16:46] way that he did of how God brought her
[16:49] from this past life and and of sin and
[16:52] changed her nature and it made an impact
[16:55] on little Boaz amen because when
[16:59] opportunity presented him presented
[17:01] itself to Boaz in a similar manner this
[17:04] wasn't such a foreign concept to Boaz
[17:08] because he had been influenced by his
[17:10] father and his mother Amen to know that
[17:13] God's ways are higher than our ways you
[17:17] know Boaz boaz's judgment wasn't clouded
[17:20] by the popular opinion or you know where
[17:23] Ruth came from or how his inheritance
[17:26] was going to be somehow jilted away from
[17:28] him he was pleased to share that
[17:32] inheritance with Ruth and all Boaz saw
[17:36] was her character and how she was a ver
[17:38] look at the what we read that how he
[17:40] said that she was a virtuous woman in
[17:42] the sight of of of himself in the sight
[17:44] of those that saw her that's what Boaz
[17:47] was looking at Boaz wasn't looking at
[17:49] what she came from Boaz wasn't looking
[17:51] at how she was already married and how
[17:53] he was going to have to take you know
[17:55] this other name and and and share his
[17:57] inheritance he wasn't looking looking at
[17:59] that he was pleased to share that
[18:01] inheritance it's such a beautiful
[18:03] picture you know and it and it leads to
[18:05] this this story we know this of
[18:08] redemption CU it's not about your past
[18:11] amen it's not about it's not about where
[18:13] you came from it's not about how many
[18:15] wrongs that you've done in your life
[18:18] your Redeemer wants to share his
[18:21] inheritance with you that is a beautiful
[18:24] story of redemption amen he sees you for
[18:27] what you really are
[18:29] aren't you thankful for that I'm so
[18:31] thankful for who you really are he's
[18:33] he's looking past your your current
[18:36] condition you know when brother brother
[18:37] Jason was preaching that last couple
[18:39] Sundays ago and he he sees the
[18:40] eternities he sees where we're going to
[18:43] be at he sees us dwelling with him he's
[18:45] not looking at just the Here and Now
[18:47] what we so focus on so often times he's
[18:50] looking at the finished product because
[18:51] he knows that he's going to have this
[18:53] eternal fellowship with his bride amen
[18:56] and that's what he's looking at amen
[18:59] you know the drama set up there you know
[19:02] I wanted to catch this too once Boaz
[19:05] took Ruth to be his wife in chapter 4
[19:09] she didn't carry that title anymore as
[19:11] Ruth the moabit glory to God we don't
[19:15] have to carry the title of what we used
[19:17] to be anymore God redeemed us out of
[19:19] that life amen and um the drama set up
[19:22] there in the fourth chapter is really
[19:25] just beautiful we don't have time to get
[19:27] into it but you know Naomi tells Ruth I
[19:30] wanted to catch this uh verse uh
[19:33] particularly chapter 3 and verse 18 and
[19:37] I wanted to it just it just really spoke
[19:40] to me when I was reading this Naomi
[19:42] tells Ruth sit still my daughter until
[19:47] thou know how the matter will fall for
[19:51] the man will not be in rest until we
[19:54] have finished until he has finished the
[19:57] thing this day I love that you see
[20:00] the story of our Redemption the story of
[20:04] your Redemption is one of chapter 3: 18
[20:08] it's one of rest amen you rest in what
[20:12] God is going to complete for you amen
[20:14] you rest in what God has already done
[20:18] amen you rest in that because you know
[20:21] that your Redeemer Lives you know that
[20:23] he he already he's already paid the
[20:26] price he's already done the work work so
[20:29] now it's time to rest but I love that
[20:31] because I think in that span of time
[20:34] between the end of chapter 3 right there
[20:36] at the end of chapter 3 Naomi catches
[20:40] catches something about Ruth she she
[20:42] says sit still my daughter there was
[20:44] there was a certain amount of of
[20:46] anxiousness that she started to catch at
[20:49] first because there was this nearer
[20:51] Kinsman amen there was this near Kinsman
[20:54] that had the ability to redeem her amen
[20:58] and so so what she was to do was go and
[21:00] sit in the house and wait until he had
[21:03] he he he had finished this plan but when
[21:06] Naomi catches
[21:08] it she says you need to sit still my
[21:11] daughter because you know Ruth loved
[21:15] Boaz and she maybe thought that there
[21:17] was going to be this situation that that
[21:20] could destroy everything or or ruin
[21:22] everything I think that sometimes you
[21:24] just really get down into the
[21:26] nitty-gritty of this and it some times
[21:28] can dovetail us you know we know how the
[21:31] story goes we know that God's all in all
[21:34] control but maybe we get a little
[21:35] anxious from time to time of how God is
[21:38] going to how God is going to do a
[21:39] certain thing in our life or how he's
[21:41] going to bring us around or how he's
[21:43] going to bring our children or how he's
[21:45] going to how he's going to get get rid
[21:47] of this thing in my life but we should
[21:49] rest in knowing that it's already going
[21:51] to be done we just have to give it unto
[21:53] God we have to let our Our Redeemer do
[21:56] the work for us amen amen CU God's got
[21:59] it all in control amen and um you know
[22:02] our entire experience as Believers of
[22:06] the Lord Jesus Christ our entire
[22:08] existence as Believers of the message of
[22:10] the hour should be in that Ruth 3:18 sit
[22:14] still my daughter until thou know how
[22:16] the matter will fall amen now that
[22:18] doesn't that doesn't speak of us sitting
[22:20] still with anxiousness that means a a
[22:22] sitting still of of peace and of knowing
[22:25] that God is the one that's going to
[22:27] finish the work in our Liv lives amen
[22:29] you know we have to put our hands up we
[22:31] have to surrender it because Ruth at
[22:33] that time at that specific event she
[22:35] didn't have anything to do amen she she
[22:38] was she was to sit there and her
[22:40] Redeemer was going to go and do the work
[22:42] for her
[22:44] amen he's already done the redeeming
[22:47] amen the price has already paid brother
[22:49] Brenham says this Revelation chap 5 part
[22:51] 2 1961 he says and when Ruth was resting
[22:55] it was a type of the church resting in
[22:58] the promise proes of God we have the
[23:00] earnest now of our Salvation we're not
[23:03] worried about whether we're going over
[23:05] there or not or where we're going that's
[23:07] right God said so amen God promised it
[23:11] and we've got the earnest amen it's done
[23:14] been received Christ has accepted us no
[23:17] way to get away from it now we're there
[23:19] amen all we have to do is just wait till
[23:23] that he take he's down doing the Kinsman
[23:26] redeemers ship we have the earnest of it
[23:29] right now waiting for the time when he
[23:32] comes back glory to God our Father is in
[23:35] control of it all amen it's not about
[23:39] listen Saints it's not about the poor
[23:41] decisions that you made it's not about
[23:43] your past life it's not about your
[23:45] failures all of that can be turned
[23:47] around as long as you can rest in
[23:50] knowing that God can do that for you
[23:53] amen you have to let go and let God do
[23:55] that for you amen and then watched
[23:59] through Salomon and through Boaz and
[24:01] through ra uh Ruth and through Rahab
[24:04] came a son by the name of OED and OED
[24:07] came to be a father of a man named Jesse
[24:10] and Jesse became a father to a man named
[24:13] David and through the years of these
[24:16] Generations the character of true
[24:19] fatherhood was passed down amen the
[24:22] stories of redemption told over and over
[24:26] again amen that was that was the
[24:28] expression of their fatherhood was to
[24:31] carry on what this what God had called
[24:33] them to be as true fathers and then
[24:36] David we know that David was a man after
[24:39] God's Own Heart and and even when in the
[24:41] new New Testament when when people would
[24:43] say oh thou son of David who were they
[24:46] referring to they were referring to
[24:48] Jesus Christ amen thou son of thou son
[24:51] of
[24:52] David you see when when men allowed God
[24:57] to rule their lives you can see God's
[25:00] attributes really being displayed
[25:02] through that you know cuz to the outside
[25:04] perspective why would Boaz choose to
[25:06] take someone like Ruth you know he was
[25:08] wealthy his inheritance was going to be
[25:10] shared you know with with with some man
[25:13] who let who had left Israel and and
[25:16] married this Outsider from Moab but but
[25:19] God's purpose was far and above man's
[25:21] thinking of a situation amen why would
[25:23] Salon take an ex Harlot from a city of
[25:27] Jericho because God's showing that it's
[25:29] not their past that defines them amen
[25:32] it's not the poor decisions that you had
[25:35] made that Define you it's not your sins
[25:37] it's what you do when God gives you an
[25:39] opportunity to change that thing glory
[25:43] to
[25:44] God salmon Boaz OED Jesse those fathers
[25:49] taught their sons something of value
[25:53] something that was going to last them
[25:55] longer than some Earthly inheritance
[25:57] amen
[25:59] I want to look at this story and we're I
[26:01] mean this is another very familiar story
[26:03] of the prodal here in some closing
[26:05] thoughts this morning you know the the
[26:09] father of the prodal son you know just
[26:13] when Jesus tells this Parable you know
[26:15] he's expressing a fatherhood amen and
[26:18] you see Luke chapter 15 and we're going
[26:20] to just catch these verses and it said
[26:22] at verse 11 Luke 1511 and he said a
[26:25] certain man had two sons and a younger
[26:28] of them said to his father father give
[26:30] me the portion of goods that falleth to
[26:32] me and he divided unto them his living
[26:35] and not many days after the younger son
[26:37] gathered all together and took his
[26:39] journey into a far country and there
[26:41] wasted his substance with riotous living
[26:44] and when he had spent all there arose a
[26:47] mighty famine in the land and he began
[26:49] to be in want and he went and he joined
[26:52] himself to a citizen of that country and
[26:54] he sent him into his fields to feed
[26:56] swine and he would Fain have filled his
[26:59] belly with the husks that the swine did
[27:01] eat and no man gave unto him and I want
[27:03] you to catch this verse 17 and when he
[27:07] came to himself amen how how how many of
[27:11] us can truly identify with that
[27:13] statement right there how you can how
[27:15] you can walk and say I wasn't myself
[27:17] before Christ there was something that
[27:20] had me gripped but when I came to myself
[27:23] amen and and I think that every believer
[27:25] has that man when I came to myself God
[27:28] finally I I I I was I was gripped by
[27:31] something but when I came to myself and
[27:34] he said how many hired Servants of my
[27:37] fathers have bread enough to spare and
[27:39] yet I perish with hunger and he says
[27:42] Verse 18 I will arise and I will go to
[27:44] my father and I will say un Him Father
[27:46] I've sinned against heaven and before
[27:49] thee and am no more worthy to be called
[27:52] thy son look at the repentance there
[27:54] make me as one of thy hired servants
[27:57] amen and he arose and and came to his
[28:00] father and when he was yet a great way a
[28:03] far off this is so beautiful his father
[28:06] saw him and he had compassion and ran
[28:10] really the the core of this that that
[28:12] struck my heart is the expression of the
[28:15] love of this father because you you you
[28:18] see the verses but then you read between
[28:20] the lines of a verse and you as a father
[28:22] you know when you have your child and
[28:24] and it's born and it's and it grows
[28:26] there is just this new love love that
[28:28] you didn't even know existed amen there
[28:30] was just this this compassion and then
[28:33] then this love and this responsibility
[28:35] that fills your heart amen and it was
[28:38] pointed in this verse I mean you could
[28:40] see it his father the only thing his
[28:43] father had in mind was that he was about
[28:45] to redeem his son and that is what God
[28:49] has in mind for us amen he's not worried
[28:51] about he knows that the that the world
[28:53] is going to have bring baggage with you
[28:56] he knows that there's going to be but
[28:58] he's not worried about those things
[29:00] that's not even a thought process in his
[29:02] mind because he knows he can take care
[29:04] of all that his heart is he had
[29:06] compassion and he ran and he fell on his
[29:10] neck there's that there's a song and
[29:11] it's called When God Ran and when God
[29:14] runs to you he falls on his neck and he
[29:17] kissed him you know he wasn't thinking
[29:19] about the scars he wasn't thinking about
[29:22] you know anything he wasn't thinking
[29:24] about his past mistakes and he he was
[29:26] just thinking about the reconciliation
[29:29] he was thinking about how he was going
[29:30] to embrace his son he was thinking about
[29:33] all those nights that he had spent
[29:34] praying for his son he was thinking
[29:36] about all those nights that that that he
[29:39] had maybe heard the story of Ruth and it
[29:42] was a story of redemption right there
[29:44] amen you know the story of redemption
[29:48] looks different to many people you look
[29:49] at Ruth and you look at you look at uh
[29:52] Rahab then you look at this prodal it
[29:54] looks different for many people but God
[29:57] redeemed both amen and and verse 21 he
[30:01] says and the son said unto him father I
[30:03] have sinned against heaven and in thy
[30:06] sight and I'm no more worthy to be
[30:09] called thy son now if you see the
[30:11] contrast I'm not going to get into it
[30:13] but you see the contrast of that prodal
[30:16] other son he had never gone off but he
[30:19] had this Pharisee attitude towards him
[30:21] that you know I you know I never did
[30:23] I've I've done everything that you've
[30:24] told me to do and now this son is he had
[30:27] this attitude but his father was saying
[30:29] but he's he's returned now he wasn't
[30:31] looking at you see God isn't looking at
[30:34] at the then he's looking at the eternity
[30:37] amen he's looking at how now it's going
[30:39] to be a whole perfect picture now amen
[30:43] and but the father uh verse 22 but the
[30:46] father said unto his servant bring forth
[30:48] the best robe and put it on him and put
[30:51] a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet
[30:53] and bring the fatted calf kill it let us
[30:55] eat and be merry for this my son was
[30:58] dead and is alive again he was lost and
[31:01] is found and they began to be marry you
[31:04] know and and when you think of a
[31:05] Father's Love You know the world thinks
[31:08] it's it's raising raising a child and
[31:11] it's providing for him and it's feeding
[31:13] them and it's clothing him but it it
[31:14] goes so much further than that it's
[31:17] training them amen it's showing them who
[31:20] God is that's the important part of of
[31:22] training a child in the way that it
[31:23] should go it's it's it's not just in
[31:26] word either it's in deed amen it's an
[31:28] action you know and when this prodal
[31:30] came to his senses he knew where he
[31:33] could go amen he knew he would be better
[31:36] off as a servant in his father's house
[31:39] because he watched the character of his
[31:41] father growing up in his life he watched
[31:44] how his father treated his servants he
[31:46] watched that that there's something
[31:48] different about my father I've now been
[31:49] off in the world and I've squandered my
[31:51] my inheritance but but there was
[31:53] something different I've seen it I've
[31:55] seen all these things but there was
[31:57] something different about my father amen
[31:59] he had a certain attribute about him
[32:01] that I just can't pinpoint but I know
[32:03] that if I go to him I know that he'll
[32:05] treat me even better even as a servant
[32:08] that was the character of that father
[32:10] amen when Boaz came to this juncture in
[32:13] his life amen back to Ruth he had an
[32:16] example of a father who trained him amen
[32:19] I believe that you know OED would tell
[32:22] his son Jesse of the stories of of their
[32:25] ancestors Ruth and Boaz I believe that
[32:28] Jesse invested in training his sons and
[32:31] teaching them who God was in developing
[32:34] their nature because it showed it showed
[32:37] in their character amen the life of
[32:39] David sitting out on Green Pastures
[32:41] thinking and pondering the things of God
[32:44] I believe he was pondering those things
[32:46] that his father trained him up as a
[32:47] child aren't you glad that you have a
[32:51] heavenly father that is invested in you
[32:54] amen he's got it all planned out you
[32:56] know sure there's there he he knows
[32:58] there's going to be times where he has
[32:59] to correct you amen and there's going to
[33:01] be times that maybe he's you know
[33:04] disappointed but it doesn't matter
[33:07] because he's not looking at that he's
[33:09] looking for a repentant heart and he's
[33:11] looking for Redemption that's that's
[33:13] that's that's his heart amen amen and
[33:16] you can rest assured that his heart
[33:20] because this was Jesus who told tells
[33:22] that Parable his heart is like the heart
[33:25] of that prodal that father of the prodal
[33:28] so ready for you to return to him amen
[33:31] doesn't care about baggage that you
[33:33] might bring he he's not even thinking
[33:35] there was there's nothing in that verse
[33:37] where he's thinking about your past he's
[33:39] thinking about your future amen he knows
[33:41] he can take care of all that glory to
[33:44] God I'm so glad for my heavenly father
[33:48] amen we're just going to say a little
[33:49] quick little prayer here Heavenly Father
