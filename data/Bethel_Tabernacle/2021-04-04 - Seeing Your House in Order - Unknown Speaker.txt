TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord saying i beseech thee lord remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore and it came to pass before isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the lord came to him saying turn again and tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord and i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver thee this city and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city for mine own sake and for my servant david's sake let's pray father we thank you this morning for your word lord there's a blessing just in reading your word and a blessing and hearing it read so father may we stand under the fountain of that blessing today be with us lord and strengthen me and body and father give us attentiveness and hearing hearts above all things we commit this to you today in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated it's quite an amazing story this story of hezekiah and i want to as i did with the brothers yesterday i felt the need to really build hezekiah up in your mind and you say well why would why would you need to do that well i can tell you as a student of the scripture for since a boy and i've always studied the word of god intently from a very very young age and even even with all of that and everything brother branham had ever said about it i never really did a real examination of all of hezekiah's accomplishments hezekiah was probably he was certainly one of the greatest kings israel ever had and he was by far and away the most obedient king that israel ever had you'll find that even when you say well you know there was david and there was solomon but i don't need to rehearse to you the failures of david and i mean david's failures were so enormous that he got tens and tens of thousands of israelites killed and he set plagues loose by his failures he uh an innocent baby lost its life because of david's failures uh solomon we could go down and talk about what a great king he was represented the millennium time there it was a millennium time almost for israel but yet hezekiah in all of his life there's not a single thing ever recorded against him but one little small slip up and all it was was he he got a little bit prideful and uh he kind of bragged about all of his blessings you know you know look at all my gold and all my silver and all of our dedicated instruments and look at our temple and look at my palace and you know he's showing it to babylonian diplomats which was not a smart idea because then they they were going to come later and try to take it from him uh so you know you don't want to cast your pearl before swine you understand so there's a there's a balance even when you're witnessing the great things god has done for you so you've got to have wisdom when you're witnessing even even to know who to witness to and and to what level sometimes brother branham would come along and if he felt a little tug to witness to him he'd just tell a little story just enough to drop a little spiritual note in not even hardly noticeable and see if he'd get a reaction you know if if you keep throwing a lure into a spot and you don't get nothing you're going to change to another spot so so brother branham you know used a lot of wisdom when he was witnessing and so hezekiah you know not only so so now let me first say not only when we look at what he didn't do in other words he didn't commit adultery with bathsheba he didn't chase the wind like solomon he didn't number the people like david he didn't set up idols like solomon you're following the picture hezekiah just by virtue of what he never fell into you should go my goodness this guy was an epic king but then when we begin to look at even the things that he actually did we find that that that hezekiah you know he took the throne at 25 and his name means god has strengthened now he didn't even have the advantage of a godly father his father the king before him was an exceptionally wicked king you know just uh spilled idolatry everywhere uh throughout um israel in fact is it was under the reign of his father that we find that that the the very the very br brass serpent that moses built for the people they actually had set that thing up as a shrine and were worshiping it it was hezekiah who destroyed it now imagine the kind of revelation it took to go and destroy something moses built see so this was a man who was very uh adept at hearing from god we find that even at 25 years old he zealously began as soon as he got the throne from his dad ahaz who had been ahaz had been one of the worst kings in israel's history and so we find that that as soon as hezekiah got the throne at 25 he reopened the temple in jerusalem he sanctified the temple vessels that had been desecrated he reinstated the levitical priesthood he restored proper worship brought back the passover as a national holiday i mean they weren't even having church the church building was closed the preachers weren't even preaching the priesthood was completely collapsed the vessels were they couldn't even use the temple vessels and so passover huh what's that passover yeah what's that i mean that had that had gone you're talking about idolatry in the as brother branham called it the most holy place the most holy people see and so hezekiah does all of this hezekiah on the political side uh he he took you know for his his continuing religious reforms he smashed all the idols throughout all the land along with all the remains of their pagan worship he smashed as i told you the the bronze serpent that moses had made and you know during the time when the assyrian empire was on the march conquering one nation after another hezekiah on the infrastructure political side he actually fortified jerusalem against siege he built a 1700 foot long tunnel to provide a secret water supply that archaeologists only just recently found and so you know and and and so this is certainly the most obedient king israel ever had and and and one of the most accomplished kings that israel ever had this is a man who understood how to talk to god and get answers back from god even though he didn't have a priesthood and a church to go to wow think about that and didn't even have the holy ghost but we find that when hezekiah has a little faux pas he gets a little prideful he doesn't honor god in all of god's blessing and sometimes we we can do that moses did that he didn't honor the lord when he struck the rock twice of course it broke the type but what really what really you know bent god at him was he said you failed to uh to sanctify me i'm the one who brought that water out not you you acted like you did that but if i hadn't done it you'd have stood there like a dummy so you know and so you didn't even you didn't even honor me when you used my power so so we realized that that he come when the lord comes to him excuse me over this and he's going to actually die and the the assyrians you know are trying to come get those treasures and hezekiah has to pay king cinecrip 300 silver talents and 30 talents of gold and and uh you know just to protect them and then later on cinecrib tries to come back and get more money you know and he's trying to extort uh the king so anyway and god had to run him off but we find that that that hezekiah when he's told that you've got a disease and you're going to die that hezekiah is told to set your house in order so if you think about it for um just a minute here is a king who was great at being a king he was great at being a believer he was great at helping people he lived selflessly he served the nation he built their infrastructure he protected him against foreign invasion he was studious he was efficient he ran the treasury correctly he opened their churches back he put the priesthood back in started supporting the ministry did all of these things but yet his home wasn't in order amen and you find the remnants of that because as soon as hezekiah passes away his son succeeds him and immediately goes right back to idolatry and replenishes the land into idolatry so here is hezekiah sometimes if we're not careful friends you know where we can be we can be all out to the uttermost part of the earth you know say well i've never been there well maybe you're in judea and all samaria you see but you say well you know uh i don't even know about that but the real question that jesus told the the real statement that jesus made to his disciples were you'll receive power and the first place you'll have to be a witness is in your home in your jerusalem personal jerusalem there's where you'll have to set the standard don't go trying to run out into judea and don't whatever you do try to go out into samaria in the outer regions and whatever you do don't be trying to run abroad without you know without your home in order without first things first you should always do first things first you know just like you make god first in your life and you don't make him second and brother branham said he don't want to be second he don't deserve to be second he deserves to be first he paid a great price to be first in your life and i think you ought to honor that moses had a commission to go and do what he was going to do god told him verbatim go do this he had thus saith the lord and when he went to do it here comes a destroying angel to kill his child because he didn't have his home in order first yes he had a commission yes he had thus saith the lord but if it wasn't for zipporah quickly recognizing you know there's nobody who knows the husband's shortcomings more than the wife and so when she sees this angel coming to take out her child it doesn't take her a second to figure out what's up she knows okay this is why this is moses again running off without everything ready and trying to do god a service and it's even god's will but his home isn't in order and so quickly she does she has to pick up his slack she the well the wife wasn't a circumcised child that was the man's job and so we find that she's having she's a spiritual woman who has to make up for the spiritual holes in moses's swiss cheese as we were saying to the brothers yesterday you got holes in your cheese it's good cheese tastes great it's got holes in it your life might be good it might be great you might be doing a much for god but what about the holes that might exist at ground level at ground zero right where you live example before your family the example before your spouse now this is brother or sister i think the example of hezekiah applies to men and women because we all have our place i'm going to tell you something friends we're living in a day as i spoke to the brothers yesterday that we're living in a time where it's a dismal time where there's such a blending of light and darkness that it's dismal and you can't it the the more it blends and everything's about blending now they they've got it so blended you know it started out with you know it doesn't matter you know you know what what you believe as long as you believe jesus was the son of god who died for you but it matters more than that you see it wouldn't have done it wouldn't have done a man any good imagine a man standing there at golgotha watching jesus die believing him to be the son of god hearing his last words and walking away from there and with a bold declaration i am a follower of jesus christ and i believe in that man he is my lord and my savior and then and then 50 days later when peter comes out and preaches an indictment and the other disciples start preaching in the streets and that man says well you know i know about jesus at calvary but these apostles i i don't need that i don't there's no it's not incumbent upon me to to believe the continuation of calvary as long as i believe that historical event i'm good no you're not because the whole kingdom the whole doctrine of everything is built on the doctrine of the apostles and prophets and therefore jesus that whole ministry of jesus and the son of man ministry was going to replicate itself in a church and that was that was what was going to go into all the world so you you you you can't just you know have one part of something fixed you've got to take all the word and here we are in this day where they finally said there's such a blending to where now they're they're even there are lawsuits and people getting fired from jobs because they won't call they they call a man a man when the man doesn't want to be called a man okay i'll call you a woman i don't want to be don't call me anything don't identify me as a gender i'm well what are you then i'm neither so what are you yeah neither okay so what do i call you it you know do i call you an it you're not a he you're not a her but people today are actually losing their jobs losing their careers over this because because they they look at a man and call him by his man name his birth name and you know or a woman and the whole thing this is the blending it's it's such a time of a blending of light and darkness that it's becoming increasingly more difficult to discern between right and wrong and this is why mankind was told in prophecy that at the end one of the one of the telltale signs of the end time would be humanity would lose its ability to discern between right and wrong so that they would call things that are obviously wrong and had been thought of as wrong for thousands of years suddenly they'd call it right and call you wrong for not calling it right though it was though their parents and grandparents and great-grandparents called it wrong and you know you you uh the society is so woke today that you you don't even hardly know what to say in public and and you find out that these pre-tribulation and i use that word very sparingly you know but we find that elements that are going to be poured out in fullness in the tribulation you can't buy or sell except you have that mark the bride doesn't see that in its fullness but we are already seeing the platforms of it being built there are people already losing their income because they won't acquiesce to the to the radical antichrist spirit and so i'm here to tell you something friends you all you're already at a point where you'll deny yourself opportunities to to advance by staying with the bible and so so we find that that and and and therefore if there was ever an age where we have to have our spiritual compass calibrated shined up and cleaned and out and looking at it for every step we make because if you don't have a spiritual compass that's functioning properly in this day of blending of light and darkness and blending of right and wrong if you don't have a spiritual compass you're finished you're just finished you don't stand a chance this is not the time to have your senses dulled by the entertainments and rudiments of the world you need to have your spiritual acuity needs to be sharp you need to be constantly in contact with god this was this was the saving grace for hezekiah because he could go to god and and say lord you know i've been a righteous man and god actually applauded him and said i mean it's remarkable if if i say you're you're a good old boy or if i pat you on the back or if i give you a hero cookie it's another thing if a prophet even comes along and says i don't see any sin in your life you're clean before god but it's on all another whole another level for god to come down and go actually you're right hezekiah you have been a just man and you've lived perfectly you you're you're correct and beca and you're weeping bitterly and i really believe friends that that that was what was fueling the bitter tears that hezekiah became suddenly aware that i've done everything but do the first thing first i did the second third and fourth and fifth things really well but i've got holes in my cheese my home isn't exactly right my children are suffering my marriage is suffering my my the the the token to be applied over my home is hindered i want to tell you something friends i think that was what fueled the desperation of hezekiah's prayers because hezekiah could have just went on to his reward he had earned quite a bit amen but he didn't want to go with his home left unfixed amen and so you know that is a great lesson that we should take today out of the life of this great king god bless you let's stand father we thank you for our little sunday school class today i pray that it'll be a blessing to all those near and far lord this is a great day our easter sunday we thank you that we are here and alive to see it master so we're committing ourselves to you afresh for the continuation of the service today in jesus name amen god bless you friends
