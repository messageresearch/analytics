[7:14] first peter chapter five
[7:17] and we'd like to get back to what we
[7:19] spoke on last sunday
[7:22] we spoke on present darkness
[7:25] and so we just want to come to just
[7:27] another portion of that
[7:30] first peter chapter five
[7:34] and we'll just read one one verse here
[7:38] verse eight be sober
[7:42] be vigilant because your adversary the
[7:45] devil
[7:46] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[7:49] whom he may
[7:50] devour you can be seated this morning we
[7:53] spoke
[7:53] last sunday on present darkness
[7:57] we took a lot of time to lay a
[7:58] foundation so if you missed that you
[8:00] could go back and grab
[8:01] that i won't do too much recap today
[8:04] because we just have a lot more
[8:06] again as we left you last time we don't
[8:08] have time in these sunday schools
[8:11] especially when we're running late uh to
[8:13] uh to really cover
[8:15] to to draw a conclusion or get to a
[8:17] conclusion but we'll we'll pose some
[8:19] questions today
[8:21] maybe cover some wrong answers uh rather
[8:24] than getting to the right answer i think
[8:26] that's important
[8:27] sometimes when you're looking at a
[8:29] subject or a question is to
[8:31] study the wrong answers answers
[8:34] sometimes
[8:35] are not necessarily entirely wrong
[8:38] uh but they're a lot of times inadequate
[8:42] answers to the questions that we ask and
[8:45] so we looked a lot
[8:46] last sunday about the evil in the world
[8:48] we
[8:49] we talked a lot about a heavy subject
[8:51] for the whole world and that was the
[8:53] columbine high school shootings
[8:55] and uh and we we spoke a lot about the
[8:58] evil
[8:59] that happened in a very short amount of
[9:01] time we spoke about the devil
[9:03] the bible calls him a adversary that
[9:06] like a adversary
[9:08] he's like a roaring lion the jesus said
[9:11] he was a murderer
[9:12] from the beginning and so we looked at
[9:15] the nature
[9:16] of him that he's a destroyer and so
[9:19] today we want to cover just another
[9:21] aspect of that
[9:22] and we looked at that columbine disaster
[9:26] and that was just one that we could have
[9:28] chose out of
[9:29] just many yeah i mean you you you
[9:33] the the list is endless of disasters
[9:36] that happen in the world
[9:38] they're at an alarming rate today all
[9:40] you have to do is turn on
[9:42] or tune into any news website or station
[9:45] it's constantly a negative news cycle
[9:48] whether it's a school shooting or a
[9:51] serial killer
[9:53] uh and and that's you know unleashed in
[9:56] a neighborhood and they can't find him
[9:57] or uh
[9:58] or a terrorist attack like 9 11
[10:01] something
[10:02] uh maybe doesn't always happen on our
[10:04] soil here in the u.s but it happens all
[10:06] over the world all the time amen
[10:07] a terrorist attack a school shooting
[10:10] some horrible
[10:11] like the man who we spoke about that
[10:13] went into his work and shot up
[10:15] you know several people disasters are
[10:18] everywhere and they're not just
[10:19] human but they're also natural
[10:22] sometimes we have natural disasters
[10:26] like a tsunami that happened in japan
[10:29] and your mind will recollect and go back
[10:32] and and think of that disaster
[10:34] tornadoes i mean every single year it
[10:38] just seems like to me like tornadoes
[10:40] either they're reported more than they
[10:42] ever were or they're happening more than
[10:43] they
[10:44] ever uh earthquakes mudslides
[10:49] evil that's all part of the curse of
[10:51] what we spoke on last
[10:53] sunday that was part of the curse that
[10:55] was brought upon not just
[10:57] man but also the earth
[11:00] diseases pandemics
[11:03] yeah a a a you know whether it was
[11:06] coronavirus
[11:07] or the zika virus or the bird flu
[11:11] or the dog flu or the cat flu or
[11:12] whatever kind of next virus they want to
[11:14] come we want to have
[11:16] amen the world is full of
[11:19] evil diseases pandemics
[11:22] evil is present that's what we're
[11:24] speaking on and teaching on is present
[11:26] darkness the world that we live in
[11:30] is present with darkness and evil is
[11:33] present in almost every aspect of our
[11:35] life
[11:36] and one question that man always
[11:40] asks believer and unbeliever alike
[11:42] especially unbelievers
[11:44] one question that is always asked after
[11:47] disaster
[11:49] whether it was the columbine shooting or
[11:51] the tsunami in japan
[11:54] they always ask where was god
[11:57] where was where was god in all of it
[12:00] where was god in columbine why didn't
[12:03] god stop it
[12:05] and that question is always and today we
[12:08] want as we said we won't attempt to
[12:10] answer that question but we'll
[12:13] rather dissect the question itself and
[12:16] look at maybe some wrong answers if we
[12:18] if we have any time today that question
[12:21] on
[12:22] obviously assumes two things
[12:26] it assumes that number one god
[12:30] is all-powerful and it also assumes that
[12:35] god is all loving you see if you remove
[12:38] those two questions you don't have a
[12:40] problem
[12:42] if you don't believe that god is
[12:43] all-powerful
[12:45] they couldn't have done anything to stop
[12:46] columbine right if you believe he's if
[12:48] you don't believe he's all-powerful he
[12:50] couldn't have done anything to stop the
[12:52] tsunami
[12:53] or 911 or whatever the disaster or
[12:55] coronavirus
[12:57] so you have to assume first in order to
[13:00] have a problem which many people
[13:02] have created a problem that problem is
[13:05] where was god if god is
[13:06] all loving if god loves everybody why
[13:09] does things like this take place
[13:11] and so you also have to assume that god
[13:13] is all loving because if he's all loving
[13:16] how could he let how good a god is all
[13:17] loving let
[13:18] things like this happen and it's amazing
[13:21] when you look at the answers
[13:23] that not only non-believers but even
[13:25] christians even
[13:26] christian orators and radio preachers
[13:29] and different theologians
[13:31] it's amazing when you see the attempt
[13:33] and sometimes many times
[13:35] not necessarily as we said not always
[13:38] just
[13:39] uh the wrong answer com the wrong answer
[13:41] is not always completely wrong
[13:43] a lot of times it has a lot of truth but
[13:45] it's inadequate
[13:46] it's an inadequate answer it doesn't
[13:48] fully uh
[13:50] give the bible reason you know what i'm
[13:52] glad for
[13:53] there's an answer oh yeah amen amen
[13:56] that's what i'm really
[13:56] thankful for today there's always an
[13:59] answer
[14:00] in the word it's not always an answer
[14:01] that people like
[14:04] but there's always an answer days after
[14:08] the 9 11 attacks there was
[14:11] that question many asking the same
[14:13] question how did this happen where was
[14:16] god in
[14:16] all of this if we're a christian nation
[14:19] how could god alone it's amazing the
[14:21] result of 9 11
[14:22] was a result of great unity
[14:26] and amongst many different people
[14:29] the tsunami in japan that tsunami that
[14:32] happened
[14:33] killed 50 times more people
[14:36] yeah than 9 11. amen
[14:39] it did i don't even know how many times
[14:42] but
[14:43] the amount of damage that the tsunami
[14:46] did
[14:47] to just real estate property was
[14:50] insurmountable i mean the world trade
[14:52] center was a few buildings
[14:55] that killed a large amount of people but
[14:58] the tsunami
[14:59] killed 50 times more people damaged
[15:02] wreaked havoc across an entire country
[15:05] and nations it wasn't just the nation of
[15:07] japan that was affected there was many
[15:09] people from other countries
[15:11] that tsunami affected the entire world
[15:14] took many lives affected many more
[15:17] people
[15:18] and nations but the biggest difference
[15:20] between
[15:21] 9 11 and the japan tsunami
[15:24] earthquake the two disasters is that
[15:28] the tsunami wasn't caused by a human
[15:32] there was no person there was no
[15:36] terrorist group to go after
[15:39] there was no mission no way to solve the
[15:42] problem
[15:43] no way to put blame on anybody
[15:47] this is what insurance companies call an
[15:50] act of god
[15:52] when it's simply really you know it's
[15:54] amazing they call it that
[15:56] you know we it's really what it means is
[15:58] it's something that they can't ensure
[15:59] against right
[16:00] and it's amazing because it's really
[16:03] meaningless it's really
[16:04] sad when you when you think about that i
[16:06] was thinking about the other day your
[16:07] insurance company policies written
[16:09] you know and it has everything that it
[16:11] doesn't cover and one of them was an act
[16:13] of god and you know that used to mean
[16:15] something in this nation
[16:16] because people believed in god and it's
[16:20] to me it's as meaningless as putting
[16:21] your hand upon a bible and
[16:23] making an oath to swear that you'll tell
[16:25] the truth that means nothing
[16:27] it's just cliche really all it is is a
[16:29] vestige or a
[16:30] remnant of our past of a godly nation
[16:34] but it really means sadly nothing today
[16:37] but they call it a a act of god
[16:41] and it's amazing because the horror
[16:45] from that disaster the destruction
[16:49] from that tsunami was massive as in any
[16:53] disaster that happens in the world
[16:56] the collateral damages we covered last
[17:00] sunday
[17:00] what was incredible to me when i studied
[17:03] looked at the documentary on columbine
[17:06] is the knot it was amazing that the
[17:09] largest effect the most sobering
[17:13] that affected me more than watching the
[17:15] surveillance of the boys
[17:17] you know shoot up the school what was
[17:18] way more impactful
[17:20] was the years of ruin
[17:23] that that caused to families even today
[17:27] the suicides and divorces and emotional
[17:30] trauma of those families the cataclysmic
[17:33] collateral damage that follows year
[17:36] after year after year
[17:38] and and the horror
[17:41] there's many needs that rise out of a
[17:44] disaster
[17:45] something like a tsunami let's look at
[17:48] some of those the first need after a
[17:50] disaster and we're just going to look at
[17:51] these
[17:52] uh one by one the first need after a
[17:55] disaster happens is a physical it's on a
[17:57] physical
[17:58] level and you look at we need medical
[18:01] aid we need
[18:02] to attend to the wounded you need to
[18:05] bury the dead
[18:07] they need food they need water they need
[18:10] shelter it's the immediate response
[18:12] after calamity after disaster is the
[18:15] human needs the physical needs uh we
[18:18] need
[18:19] food we need shelter and it was amazing
[18:20] there was an outpouring across the
[18:22] entire
[18:22] world after that tsunami of outpouring
[18:25] of
[18:26] first responders and medical aid and
[18:29] food and supplies
[18:31] it's amazing those physical needs
[18:33] quickly
[18:34] give way to emotional needs
[18:37] because the emotional toll and the
[18:39] damage that's brought upon
[18:42] after something like that tsunami or
[18:44] shooting or as we said any
[18:46] kind of disaster or crisis is there's
[18:50] always an emotional need of shock
[18:52] and people go into shock the trauma the
[18:56] the mental emotional trauma and the
[18:59] shock and they bring in counselors to
[19:01] try to help
[19:01] people uh you know reconcile
[19:05] what happened and those that are who
[19:08] really do suffer
[19:09] in a in a very much like a physical way
[19:12] sometimes emotional
[19:14] suffering is harder to bear than
[19:16] physical suffering
[19:19] after that shock is gone and the next
[19:22] emotion
[19:23] that is dealt with is grief
[19:26] and sorrow those that are lost those
[19:29] that
[19:29] even in that tsunami the stories that
[19:32] came out of it of this
[19:33] of the survivors looking for
[19:36] years have to this day have never
[19:39] found the body of their missing of their
[19:42] loved one they even never knew what
[19:44] happened to them
[19:45] no closure no news
[19:51] and after sorrow and grief begin to
[19:54] subside the next emotion that comes for
[19:56] a lot of people is
[19:57] anger and bitterness
[20:00] there's always anger after every
[20:03] disaster
[20:04] or calamity that happens in the world
[20:07] anger needs to be directed
[20:09] somewhere and there's got to be someone
[20:12] to blame
[20:13] there's got to be a scapegoat someone to
[20:16] look for
[20:17] people look for someone to vent their
[20:19] anger to
[20:21] and in this case because there was no
[20:23] terrorist group or human
[20:24] entity that they can blame god becomes
[20:27] the scapegoat
[20:29] and people blame god and they
[20:32] as they as i said they're assuming two
[20:34] things even those who don't
[20:36] necessarily even really know if they
[20:39] believe in god
[20:40] or not are quick to suddenly believe in
[20:43] god
[20:44] and blame god and that anger is
[20:48] someone they need someone to vent to so
[20:50] they can't blame anyone or any person
[20:52] no human being to blame and so the
[20:56] the scapegoat becomes god the tragedy
[20:58] after every disaster is that people
[21:00] either are drawn
[21:02] nearer to god or they're pushed further
[21:04] away from god
[21:05] amen that always happens no matter who
[21:08] you are
[21:08] if you're a believer unbeliever after
[21:10] every
[21:11] hard thing or crisis you're either one
[21:14] or the other whether you were affected
[21:16] even people who weren't in japan when
[21:19] the tsunami happened
[21:20] were affected in some way one or the
[21:22] other
[21:24] and it's amazing because
[21:28] we moved to the next the next need
[21:31] after disaster and it's probably the
[21:33] most important one that we're going to
[21:35] discuss
[21:36] is the intellectual need
[21:39] because after physical gives way to
[21:42] emotional and that emotion
[21:44] turns from shock to
[21:48] grief and sorrow and then that turns to
[21:50] anger and then that turns to blame
[21:54] we move to the intellectual needs
[21:57] and there is in every person everybody
[22:01] there is a need to make sense
[22:04] out of everything yeah it's in all of us
[22:08] we have to make sense as to why why did
[22:11] this happen we ask really deep
[22:13] questions and it's in every person two
[22:16] major questions that everyone
[22:18] wants to ask intellectually is
[22:21] first how how did something take place
[22:24] how did something like
[22:26] this happen you know especially when
[22:28] it's a school shooter or a shooting and
[22:30] how did it happen and
[22:32] we've gotta we've gotta we've gotta do
[22:33] something put preventative measures
[22:36] to avoid it and as we we said last
[22:39] sunday
[22:40] you know they're they're blaming guns
[22:42] and they're blaming video games after
[22:44] the columbine and they're blaming
[22:46] every tangible thing that they possibly
[22:49] can they don't ever get to the root of
[22:51] the problem and the root is that
[22:53] there's present darkness yeah there's
[22:55] evil bound up the bible says in the
[22:57] heart of every human being
[22:59] that outside of god the human is a brute
[23:03] beast
[23:04] amen that's what brother branham said
[23:06] said outside of that nature change he's
[23:08] just a
[23:09] beast and moral law and government is
[23:12] the only thing that restrains him
[23:15] sometimes it's conduct good parents good
[23:18] raising
[23:19] good family a good foundation good home
[23:22] good relationships and then outside of
[23:25] that
[23:25] a person is tamed by the government
[23:29] the laws and the fear of prison right
[23:31] amen
[23:33] but that really doesn't deal with the
[23:34] cardinal brewpiece nature that's in
[23:36] everybody
[23:37] before they're born again can you say
[23:39] amen amen amen
[23:41] and so first they ask how did this
[23:43] happen and then they asked
[23:44] what caused it and naturally speaking of
[23:47] course science always has
[23:49] a way to be able to answer this question
[23:51] well how did it happen
[23:53] well two tectonic plates uh
[23:56] collided or got caught stuck one with
[23:59] the other and then it froze
[24:01] and then energy was built and then
[24:02] eventually those tectonic plates
[24:05] gave way and that energy created an
[24:07] earthquake and that earthquake created a
[24:09] tsunami
[24:10] and then intellectually we would figure
[24:12] everything out of how it happened
[24:15] and the reason for asking these
[24:18] questions is that so
[24:20] somehow we can avoid it or escape it
[24:23] or at least have a warning against it
[24:27] what i find so amazing
[24:30] is the the the
[24:33] recognition of
[24:36] outward external things that we can
[24:40] blame
[24:41] and then we could go to congress and we
[24:43] could pass bills and
[24:44] surely and everyone it's like they're
[24:46] trying to
[24:48] they're they they somehow think it's
[24:50] really a futile it's just
[24:52] futile efforts of men but somehow if we
[24:54] pass enough laws if we put enough
[24:56] restrictions if we put enough measures
[24:58] in place
[24:59] but you'll never ever stop the nature
[25:03] of the devil he's a murderer amen from
[25:06] the beginning amen
[25:08] and the bible calls someone like a rory
[25:10] lion seeking whom he
[25:12] may devour and he's only proud
[25:15] constantly and he's used every kind of
[25:19] medium that he can and it's and
[25:22] sometimes it's harmless things like cell
[25:25] phones
[25:25] or social networks and any way he can
[25:28] bring abuse or emotional
[25:31] um uh in any way he could use
[25:34] any kind of tool that's why they i've
[25:36] used many times the words of the apostle
[25:38] paul
[25:39] when he says be not ignorant of the
[25:41] devils we are not ignorant of the
[25:43] devil's devices
[25:45] amen amen but his devices are many yeah
[25:48] iphones and androids and ipads amen
[25:52] if you live depending on how far away
[25:54] from god you live or not
[25:57] there's always a device that has a way
[26:00] to
[26:01] trip us up or trap us it's amazing that
[26:03] there's always a blame towards external
[26:05] things but
[26:06] never the introspective look
[26:09] at the human heart and that evil
[26:12] is a problem in the world evil is on
[26:16] every level and every pardon
[26:20] it's it's it's a it's a question that is
[26:23] constantly asked
[26:25] by the world how did this happen we're
[26:28] going to we don't have really time to
[26:29] look at
[26:32] where i wanted to go next let me just
[26:34] find my place here
[26:37] and then maybe we'll uh what time is it
[26:40] 10 55.
[26:42] let's stand we're not going to be able
[26:43] to segway to jump into that
