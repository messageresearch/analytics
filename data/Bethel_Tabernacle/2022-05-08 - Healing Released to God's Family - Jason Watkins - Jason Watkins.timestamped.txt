[42:28] seating it's youth and the parents of
[42:31] youth first
[42:32] and we will have an overflow in the
[42:34] fellowship hall so i don't want you to
[42:37] think that you can't come to church on
[42:39] this next week and you can it's just
[42:42] there will probably not be any seating
[42:44] available inside the sanctuary because
[42:47] we
[42:47] we we nearly capped out our 150 young
[42:51] people coming in from many states and
[42:53] then there's the parents uh of our youth
[42:56] and parents that'll show up with their
[42:57] youth and so we'll probably have the
[42:59] sanctuary packed out hey jd it is course
[43:01] in tate park right okay yeah
[43:03] on saturday now you need to get to
[43:06] praying
[43:07] because the weather is forecasting rain
[43:10] for saturday but when i start when i
[43:12] when we i mentioned that at the
[43:14] minister's meeting and it was 90
[43:16] and today it was only 70 so prayer is
[43:19] working
[43:20] keep it going keep it going uh in buford
[43:23] we don't we don't worry about anything
[43:24] unless it goes above 60 anyhow 60 in
[43:27] buford means nothing
[43:29] and we all know that brother brad says
[43:31] he's having to get used to that and i
[43:32] said get used to it because 60 rain
[43:35] around here means almost no chance of
[43:37] rain uh so right now it's at 70 but i'd
[43:40] like to see a a wonderful beautiful
[43:42] weekend how many knows god has done that
[43:44] for us time and time and time and time

[44:53] verse that's what it is verse 16. we're

[45:02] jesus speaking then said he unto him
[45:06] a certain man made a great supper and
[45:09] bade many
[45:10] and sent his servant at suppertime to
[45:13] say to them that were bidden come
[45:15] for all things are now ready
[45:19] and they all with one consent
[45:22] begin to make excuse
[45:24] the first said unto him i have bought a
[45:26] piece of ground and i must needs go and
[45:29] see it i pray thee have me excused so
[45:33] here's somebody letting business get in
[45:35] the way of their service to god and
[45:37] coming to the feast amen and another
[45:40] said i've bought five yoke of oxen same
[45:43] thing and i go to prove them i pray thee
[45:47] have me excused and another said i've
[45:50] married a wife and therefore i cannot
[45:53] come
[45:53] so that servant came
[45:56] and showed his lord these things
[45:58] then the master of the house being angry
[46:01] said to his servant go out quickly
[46:03] into the streets and lanes of the city
[46:06] and bring in hither the poor and the
[46:08] maimed and the halt and the blind
[46:10] and the servants said lord
[46:12] it is done as thou has commanded and yet
[46:15] there is room
[46:17] and the lord said unto the servant go
[46:19] out into the highways and hedges
[46:22] and compel them to come in that my house
[46:25] may be filled
[46:27] for i say unto you that none of those
[46:28] men which were bidden shall taste of my
[46:31] supper
[46:33] let's pray

[47:19] name of jesus christ we pray and believe
[47:22] it in jesus name amen god bless you you
[47:26] can be seated
[47:45] some services ago i read
[47:48] this first quote that i want to read you
[47:50] again this morning
[47:52] from
[47:53] the message identification we showed it
[47:55] on the overhead last time we won't
[47:57] bother doing that this time just to save
[47:59] some time
[48:01] brother branham says in in the message
[48:04] identification in january 1963
[48:08] he says
[48:09] we are
[48:10] invited we are invited by god not
[48:13] wonderful i mean what an opening line
[48:17] we're invited by god
[48:20] how many want to hear the invitation
[48:22] if you if you received a a note
[48:25] in your you know
[48:27] some kind of delivery came to your door
[48:29] and it said note from god man you would
[48:32] you'd be ready to open that
[48:34] we're invited by god thank you brother
[48:37] to take him
[48:39] as an example
[48:41] and let our and let let our let our let
[48:44] let
[48:45] let our character be molded
[48:49] it's an invitation
[48:52] it's not a
[48:53] it's not an uh
[48:55] uh some kind of edict that god is saying
[48:58] hey guess what i'm gonna come and crack
[49:01] you over the head with my character and
[49:02] i'm going to jam it down into you
[49:05] see we would all be crying foul if he
[49:08] tried to do that but he's saying a
[49:10] prophet is saying you are invited
[49:14] to take him as an example and let our
[49:18] character be molded
[49:21] like his
[49:22] what a thing my then watch now
[49:26] then
[49:27] now this this next statement assumes
[49:30] you're willing to do that so before i
[49:32] read the next statement how many are
[49:34] willing to let him mold his character
[49:37] into our life ten percent
[49:40] how many are willing you've been invited
[49:42] by god to let to take him as an example
[49:46] and let him mold his character into your
[49:49] life then
[49:51] when we let his character be in us
[49:55] then we have become sons by having the
[49:59] mind of christ
[50:01] mind the mind which is his character see
[50:05] let this mind be in you let his
[50:09] character be in you all right
[50:12] so which is his character your mind
[50:15] makes your character
[50:17] let the mind paul said of christ this
[50:20] mind that was in christ be in you
[50:24] let that mind of christ prophet repeats
[50:27] it be in you
[50:29] it molds here's the advantage here's the
[50:32] payoff
[50:33] it molds the character of a son of god
[50:38] sons and daughters let me add to that
[50:40] sons and daughters of god say what's the
[50:42] real advantage of that will i become the
[50:45] wealthiest person in the world
[50:47] absolutely
[50:49] absolutely in the wealth that counts
[50:54] other wealth by comparison is worth
[50:56] nothing and the antichrist is going to
[50:58] get it anyway and it's going to go in
[51:00] into ash and cinder
[51:02] come on friends it wouldn't matter what
[51:04] you acquire and accomplish and how many
[51:06] plaques are on your wall and whatever
[51:08] station you're right arise to doesn't
[51:11] matter that you get the world's plaudits
[51:13] it's all going to ash and cinder
[51:16] and but there is another realm of
[51:19] eternity where everything that you allow
[51:22] that realm to come into you survives and
[51:25] so i say if that's eternal life then
[51:28] give it to me
[51:31] see
[51:32] it molds the character of a son of god
[51:37] so brother branham says further
[51:40] in the restoration of the bride tree a
[51:42] very important message now
[51:45] he says
[51:46] all right
[51:50] he says
[51:51] he's coming now to preach this this
[51:53] message and i want you to catch this
[51:55] title is super important the restoration
[51:58] of the bride tree now that's you
[52:01] amen
[52:02] it's the restoration of the tree of life
[52:05] and it's it's always the tree in the
[52:08] garden of eden the tree of life was a
[52:09] person
[52:11] the tree of knowledge was a person amen
[52:14] so when the tree of life uh became a
[52:18] person in christ jesus
[52:21] uh he he talks about being that tree
[52:24] that bread that will that water of life
[52:28] he was the light and the light the light
[52:30] was the life and the life is the light
[52:33] amen
[52:34] and so when we when we see a restoration
[52:37] of the bright tree
[52:39] then we're seeing the restoration of
[52:42] jesus in human flesh now not the
[52:44] galilean
[52:46] not the one who walked the shores of
[52:48] galilee who went about doing good do you
[52:51] realize friends that the world will not
[52:54] see that jesus again until the end of
[52:58] the tribulation
[53:00] the only form of jesus that they will
[53:03] see
[53:04] is in his body
[53:06] that's you
[53:07] that's his bride tree
[53:09] get it it's the bride tree
[53:13] all right so it's it's coming it came up
[53:16] through stages of restoration
[53:19] in the days of lutheran wesley and into
[53:21] the into the azusa revival and then it
[53:24] come into the mighty god unveiled under
[53:26] the opening of the seals and and all of
[53:28] that was to do what so that a bride
[53:31] could eat her way to a body change
[53:34] she could feed on the engrafted word of
[53:36] god receive the token life which is the
[53:39] jubilee which is eternal life and you
[53:42] say
[53:43] you know how does this work well let me
[53:46] just give you the end game it changes
[53:48] your body at the molecular level
[53:52] someday friends not in this isn't disney
[53:55] this isn't pixar this isn't a story this
[53:58] isn't dickens this is for real in real
[54:01] time the dead in christ are going to
[54:04] rise from the graves and we which are
[54:06] alive in these corp in these failing
[54:08] bodies are going to be changed in a
[54:10] moment in the twinkling of an eye into
[54:13] new bodies and it'll still be you and
[54:16] it'll still be me only it'll be the real
[54:19] me and the real you hallelujah
[54:24] and that
[54:25] that's a a preview of coming attractions
[54:29] and it's coming soon
[54:32] to a household near you
[54:34] in my kitchen in my living room
[54:38] hallelujah this drama is going to be
[54:40] played out brother branham said one of
[54:41] these days you're going to be standing
[54:42] in your kitchen and you'll feel a little
[54:44] funny feeling go over you and you'll
[54:47] turn around and there'll be the the
[54:49] parent who crossed over a sibling who
[54:51] crossed over a friend and they'll be
[54:53] standing there young
[54:55] prophet said you might feel a little
[54:57] twinge of pain and when that happens he
[54:59] said it'll be the last pain you ever
[55:03] feel
[55:05] hallelujah
[55:08] i want to make it real to you today
[55:10] friends
[55:12] so brother branham now is approaching
[55:16] the restoration of the bride tree
[55:19] message this is his sermon so i i laid
[55:22] all of that in there so you catch the
[55:24] significance of what he's about to say
[55:26] in this quote i'm going to read to you
[55:28] so bear in mind
[55:30] this is the now this is 1962.
[55:34] april
[55:35] and brother branham had a
[55:38] troubling experience
[55:41] where he heard a blast and thought it'd
[55:42] be the end of his life and it bothered
[55:44] him he didn't know what it meant it was
[55:46] the approaching seals it was coming but
[55:49] brother branham thought it must be the
[55:50] end of his life until he
[55:52] he he's later given to understand that
[55:54] it's your ministry it's not the end of
[55:56] your life it's your ministry and and
[55:58] what was happening was is there the
[56:01] restoration of the bride tree was was
[56:04] approaching its final move in the drama
[56:07] its final move in the opera its final
[56:10] move in the symphony the symphony was
[56:12] playing its last piece of music
[56:16] amen
[56:18] and so he says in this approaching time
[56:22] he says this will be my last message to
[56:24] the church for this part of the church
[56:26] for some time he's getting ready to go
[56:27] into the field
[56:29] and he says and we're expecting a
[56:31] healing service
[56:33] this morning
[56:34] now catch it
[56:36] when he's preaching the sermon the
[56:39] restoration of the bride tree he says
[56:42] we're expecting a healing service this
[56:45] morning
[56:46] and i want now watch watch him connect
[56:48] it and i want this message
[56:52] if god will bless it
[56:54] to sink deep
[56:56] into our hearts so we'll get the meaning
[57:00] of what it means
[57:04] the restoration of the bride tree is the
[57:07] endgame
[57:10] for god's family
[57:11] that she comes to the point and i say
[57:14] well then
[57:15] then then why haven't we why is it 60
[57:17] years ago when he preached this and the
[57:19] seals are open because remember that
[57:22] when jesus came to the earth he was an
[57:24] infant
[57:25] he wasn't ready to go to calvary as an
[57:27] infant he wasn't ready to go at 12.
[57:30] he wasn't ready to go at 30 when he came
[57:32] into the water then he had to go into
[57:34] the wilderness then he had to walk three
[57:36] three and a half years see and so
[57:39] and so what did brother branham say he
[57:40] said at the approach of christ in his
[57:43] first coming i'm getting ahead of myself
[57:45] but i can't turn back he says that three
[57:48] stars lined up and those magi followed
[57:50] those stars
[57:52] coming from the east for years for a
[57:54] couple of years and and what did those
[57:56] stars portend to the magi it it was an
[58:01] announcement of the approach of messiah
[58:07] and so they began they were they were
[58:08] hebrew scholars who were studying in the
[58:11] far east and when they saw that sign in
[58:14] the heavens they correlated it to
[58:16] prophecy and they realized my
[58:19] we're living in the day when time is
[58:22] going to meet prophecy and that messiah
[58:24] is coming to the earth and they they
[58:26] literally left their studies and left
[58:28] everything behind him at that point
[58:31] nothing
[58:32] nothing nothing mattered to them except
[58:36] their journey to messiah
[58:38] to find him and they came into jerusalem
[58:40] after two years of travel where is he
[58:43] where's who the king what king our king
[58:48] oh my and the bible says it caused a big
[58:50] stir everywhere even the even herod you
[58:53] know wants to question what is this
[58:54] about a king my goodness did you not
[58:56] read prophecy your majesty do you not
[58:59] realize that we have seen his star in
[59:01] the east
[59:02] this was this was actually believe it or
[59:05] not
[59:06] it shows you anointed ones at the end
[59:07] time they were following a prophecy from
[59:09] balaam
[59:12] when balak tried to get him to curse the
[59:14] jews remember that and he said i can't
[59:17] say anything but what god puts in my
[59:18] mouth and when he they offered him more
[59:20] money and more prestige and he tried to
[59:22] curse him and when he opened his mouth
[59:24] to curse him to collect the big bounty
[59:26] out comes out of his mouth oh there will
[59:28] be a star rising jacob hallelujah and
[59:31] that's exactly what happened a star they
[59:33] were literally following that star why
[59:36] because god could use even an animal or
[59:39] even a false prophet to declare his word
[59:42] you understand but i'm going to tell you
[59:44] something when the word
[59:46] comes to materialization there's nothing
[59:48] false about it in fact is it is uniquely
[59:51] the only truth
[59:54] when christ came he was the only truth
[59:57] all other truth had to be abandoned all
[1:00:00] other perceived
[1:00:02] knowledge
[1:00:03] sixteen hundred years worth
[1:00:06] to those hebrew scholars
[1:00:08] sixteen hundred years and they'd gotten
[1:00:10] it from moses no less
[1:00:13] and it was all coming to an end
[1:00:17] and so brother branham is saying
[1:00:19] we're expecting
[1:00:21] a healing service because now watch
[1:00:23] three stars lined up at his approach the
[1:00:26] first time
[1:00:28] as the seals began to come in at the
[1:00:30] latter part of 1962 there was another
[1:00:33] sign in the heavens five stars lined up
[1:00:35] and brother branham says what is it what
[1:00:37] is it what is five stars lining up what
[1:00:39] does it mean
[1:00:40] it's it's it's a sign in the heavens
[1:00:43] it's an infant bride
[1:00:46] like an infant jesus it's now an infant
[1:00:49] bride
[1:00:50] and those five stars are announcing her
[1:00:54] approach
[1:00:56] see the seals hadn't come yet she wasn't
[1:00:58] quite on the scene and then when she
[1:01:00] comes on the scene she's an infant he's
[1:01:02] not coming back to marry an infant he's
[1:01:05] coming back to marry a mature bride amen
[1:01:08] so
[1:01:09] so we've been this many decades now
[1:01:11] doing what getting the fruit back in the
[1:01:14] top of the tree it had to restore the
[1:01:16] whole bride tree because when it went
[1:01:19] down it went down from the early age
[1:01:21] when the fruits of the spirit were all
[1:01:23] shining in the presence of the son
[1:01:26] and the power of god was chronicling a
[1:01:29] book of acts and writing a faith chapter
[1:01:32] and
[1:01:32] the apostles were doing great and mighty
[1:01:34] deeds in the name of
[1:01:36] said in the name of thy holy child jesus
[1:01:41] it was literally rocking the enemy's
[1:01:43] kingdom and and satan went you know he
[1:01:47] goes to sleep one night and he's got one
[1:01:49] jesus to deal with he wakes up the next
[1:01:52] morning and here's the announcement now
[1:01:54] you got uh you got 120
[1:01:56] i mean that's a pretty big percentage to
[1:01:59] jump from one to 120. okay boys it's not
[1:02:02] the end of the world let's get our
[1:02:03] rigging let's get our plan let's go
[1:02:05] check this out he couldn't even arrive
[1:02:07] on the scene until now there's three
[1:02:09] thousand
[1:02:11] and it just went on from there and god
[1:02:13] kept adding to the church daily
[1:02:15] hallelujah he's still adding
[1:02:18] he's still calling jesus heals jesus
[1:02:21] saves jesus still fills with the holy
[1:02:24] ghost i'm a recipient of it how many are
[1:02:26] recipients of that today
[1:02:28] we know him in the power of his
[1:02:30] resurrection my goal is to know him more
[1:02:34] i do know him in the power of his
[1:02:36] resurrection my daily goal is to know
[1:02:37] him more i have a never ending never
[1:02:40] sleeping never resting never ceasing
[1:02:43] hunger for more
[1:02:45] and more
[1:02:46] and more say
[1:02:48] when when how much how much do you need
[1:02:51] can i use a rockefeller statement a
[1:02:53] little more than i got
[1:02:56] how much is enough a little more than i
[1:02:57] got
[1:02:58] i'm not body changed yet so i'm on a
[1:03:01] quest hallelujah and i don't plan to
[1:03:04] turn around i don't even plan to slow
[1:03:06] down
[1:03:09] come on friends
[1:03:10] amen praise the lord
[1:03:14] so during this this momentous time
[1:03:18] he's expecting there to be
[1:03:20] healing
[1:03:21] will accompany
[1:03:23] this arrival
[1:03:25] this stars announcing an approach
[1:03:29] the word's about to become flesh and the
[1:03:31] prophet is showing us now with the
[1:03:34] understanding once he said i want to go
[1:03:36] slow and let it sink deep so that when
[1:03:38] you get the real concept of the bride
[1:03:41] tree and that it's you trust me there's
[1:03:43] healing for mind body and soul
[1:03:47] and you're going to need it
[1:03:50] so the same way that god sent signs
[1:03:54] in the heavens as his
[1:03:56] as his appearing neared
[1:03:58] 2 000 years ago
[1:04:01] he once again did the same thing for the
[1:04:03] opening
[1:04:04] of the seven seals
[1:04:07] with lining up five stars as it began to
[1:04:10] approach it was an infant bride
[1:04:12] now in both cases and this is an
[1:04:15] important point
[1:04:17] in both cases
[1:04:19] 2 000 years ago
[1:04:21] and in and in the day in which the hour
[1:04:23] which we live at the opening of the word
[1:04:27] in both cases
[1:04:29] these signs
[1:04:31] in the heavens
[1:04:33] heralded the approach
[1:04:35] of the word coming into flesh
[1:04:39] don't lose sight of that in other words
[1:04:41] it wasn't just merely doctrine
[1:04:44] it's not about he was just going to
[1:04:46] bring more teaching you understand
[1:04:49] but there would come a dynamic
[1:04:51] see not not not just the mechanics of
[1:04:54] the teaching but there would be a
[1:04:56] teaching rain in a former rain but the
[1:04:59] latter rain would be a dynamic of the
[1:05:03] holy ghost to take that word that you
[1:05:06] fed on and put dynamic power to it and
[1:05:10] start altering your lifestyle your mind
[1:05:13] giving you power if you get sick in your
[1:05:15] body giving you power if you get bound
[1:05:17] up by a devil giving you power if you've
[1:05:20] got trouble in your home giving you
[1:05:21] power to claim young people to claim
[1:05:24] children to heal a marriage there's
[1:05:26] dynamic power
[1:05:28] in the word
[1:05:31] and so we're not here to live as paupers
[1:05:34] underprivileged i'm here to tell you
[1:05:35] something today friends with the
[1:05:37] restoration of the bride tree comes
[1:05:40] every healing you could possibly need
[1:05:44] your healing is here before you even
[1:05:46] might need it next week
[1:05:49] it's already here
[1:05:50] [Music]
[1:05:52] you wake up tomorrow feeling a little
[1:05:54] ill just know that say well my healing
[1:05:56] was here since yesterday i'm just going
[1:05:58] to go ahead and have a little bit of it
[1:06:00] amen
[1:06:02] so
[1:06:03] so in both cases
[1:06:06] they heralded the approach of the word
[1:06:07] coming into flesh and it brought healing
[1:06:09] in and
[1:06:10] and and as israel now watch this because
[1:06:13] i'm going to correlate some history to
[1:06:14] you
[1:06:15] so as
[1:06:16] israel as a nation needed healing over
[1:06:20] their minds
[1:06:22] toward the word
[1:06:23] you bear and and say what does that even
[1:06:25] mean okay okay here's something familiar
[1:06:28] you remember how brother brown talks
[1:06:29] about how that
[1:06:30] and this bears out in lexical aids
[1:06:34] galore
[1:06:35] brother branham pointed it out as all
[1:06:36] scholars do
[1:06:38] that at that time
[1:06:40] israel was looking for a general
[1:06:44] they wanted some warrior something on
[1:06:46] the order of alexander
[1:06:48] you know they had they had seen these
[1:06:50] great champions rise up
[1:06:52] and they wanted somebody on the order
[1:06:55] you know they had had a maccabean revolt
[1:06:57] and they wanted somebody they remembered
[1:06:59] joshua see they remembered david mighty
[1:07:02] warriors in battle right
[1:07:04] and and that's what they thought they
[1:07:06] needed they thought they needed a new
[1:07:09] champion they thought they needed a new
[1:07:11] general and brother branham said god
[1:07:14] humiliated them
[1:07:17] by sending him a baby
[1:07:21] lord we need a we need a warrior okay
[1:07:24] we need a we need a champion somebody
[1:07:26] who can drive all these romans out of
[1:07:28] here okay uh where is he lord come on
[1:07:30] there's a manger over here
[1:07:34] what
[1:07:35] i remember some friends of mine told me
[1:07:37] one time
[1:07:38] that uh
[1:07:39] they is way back in the day uh
[1:07:42] and they had a an only they had a son he
[1:07:45] was the only only uh boy and he had two
[1:07:47] sisters and he wanted a brother
[1:07:49] and he's only about five years old and
[1:07:51] he wanted a brother he'd get out in
[1:07:52] rough house and play in the dirt with
[1:07:54] and girls were frilly and prissy and
[1:07:55] they didn't want to do that
[1:07:57] and um
[1:07:58] so they found out that his his his aunt
[1:08:02] was gonna she was pregnant and she found
[1:08:04] out it's a boy
[1:08:05] and so they they tell him say wes
[1:08:07] she you're gonna have a little playmate
[1:08:10] he'll be your cousin
[1:08:12] wesley was so excited he was just like
[1:08:14] on cloud night he couldn't wait he had
[1:08:16] to wait nine months
[1:08:18] and finally the big day came and they
[1:08:21] brought him to the house and they walked
[1:08:23] him up to the crib they said wes check
[1:08:26] it out and he said he stood there
[1:08:29] and he said
[1:08:30] it's a baby
[1:08:34] it's a baby
[1:08:36] he thought he was going to get a little
[1:08:38] buddy immediately his age see
[1:08:40] and so so so we find out that israel
[1:08:43] needed their minds healed so you know
[1:08:46] what god did he sent him he lied to the
[1:08:48] prophet
[1:08:50] and you know what the message of john
[1:08:52] the baptist was
[1:08:54] repent
[1:08:55] now that's important
[1:08:57] repent see and it's not it's not about
[1:09:00] it's not and i'm going to show you in
[1:09:02] the book of acts here in a minute the
[1:09:03] exact same principle when paul is
[1:09:05] migrating the gospel to the jews and
[1:09:07] he's he's he's taking that along and it
[1:09:11] and and peter also on the day of
[1:09:12] pentecost when he says repent
[1:09:15] now remember when peter let me just give
[1:09:17] you this one peter when he says to those
[1:09:20] men they said what must we do and he
[1:09:22] says you must repent now they weren't
[1:09:23] drunkards and whoremongers and gamblers
[1:09:26] and extortioners
[1:09:27] the bible says these were devout jews
[1:09:31] so he's not saying a bunch of adulterers
[1:09:34] you need to clean up your life what he's
[1:09:36] saying is you have a your mind needs
[1:09:39] healed you looked at the promise and god
[1:09:42] fulfilled it in his son and you murdered
[1:09:45] him
[1:09:46] so you had a wrong concept of your your
[1:09:49] leadership told you it can't be him
[1:09:53] and and your minds were corrupted you by
[1:09:56] determinant paul peter said by
[1:09:58] determinant counsel your counselors told
[1:10:01] you this and you went through with it
[1:10:03] and and they're just destroyed over that
[1:10:05] my goodness we killed our king he says
[1:10:07] now don't worry because it wasn't
[1:10:09] possible that the grave could hold him
[1:10:11] because david had said he'll not suffer
[1:10:13] his holy one to see corruption
[1:10:15] and and the great he'll not suffer uh
[1:10:18] his soul to stay in hell and neither
[1:10:19] suffer his holy one to seek corruption
[1:10:21] and that same jesus whom you crucified
[1:10:25] has risen from the dead and god hath
[1:10:28] made him both lord and christ and right
[1:10:30] there 3 000 were added to the church
[1:10:33] what happened they repented in their
[1:10:35] minds they had their minds healed
[1:10:41] they had 1600 years of wrong thinking
[1:10:45] corrected
[1:10:46] see
[1:10:47] and that has to be brother brown talks
[1:10:49] about in greatest battle ever fall it's
[1:10:50] got to start in the mind
[1:10:52] see and then it's got to drop 18 inches
[1:10:55] under the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:10:56] it's got to drop into the heart and then
[1:10:58] that's the new birth
[1:10:59] see he's what brother brahm is saying is
[1:11:02] right off the tape he says see if he can
[1:11:04] ever get that mind to agree with his
[1:11:05] word then that old nature perishes
[1:11:08] that old nature dies you see and then
[1:11:11] paul could say i i live i i'm dead but i
[1:11:15] live the old me died i'm a brand new
[1:11:17] creation
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:20] so
[1:11:21] so the first thing they had to to have
[1:11:24] happen
[1:11:25] is they had to have their minds healed
[1:11:28] and so john the baptist elijah the
[1:11:30] prophet
[1:11:31] at the time when the
[1:11:33] when the the tree of life
[1:11:36] christ
[1:11:37] was now living in flesh and was a
[1:11:40] sacrifice for their sins and in a
[1:11:42] propitiation and an atonement and he
[1:11:45] lived the perceptive side and he was a
[1:11:46] worthy sacrifice and he ascended on high
[1:11:49] gave gifts unto men came back and lived
[1:11:51] inside of his church and this is what
[1:11:54] the gospel came to do this is this was
[1:11:57] the purpose of the gospel
[1:12:00] to bring
[1:12:02] the eternal god
[1:12:05] down into human creation
[1:12:08] and put him
[1:12:09] in the hearts and minds of people
[1:12:14] so so we find then that he's calling on
[1:12:17] them to repent of their thinking
[1:12:20] toward the promise of redemption that
[1:12:24] that was in the scripture
[1:12:25] israel had been promised a redeemer see
[1:12:29] just like today now let's fast forward
[1:12:31] to to the end game the whole world of
[1:12:34] christianity has been promised a savior
[1:12:37] to come and take us all to heaven amen i
[1:12:40] just was quoting you from first
[1:12:41] thessalonians 4 we which your life
[1:12:43] remains shall be changed in a moment in
[1:12:45] a twinkling of an eye all christendom
[1:12:47] waits for that hour see so the prophecy
[1:12:50] is is the same for us now but at the
[1:12:53] restoration of the bride tree there had
[1:12:56] to first come again a prophet with a
[1:12:59] message of healing that could not just
[1:13:02] heal their bodies but heal their mind
[1:13:06] and correct their error on how god was
[1:13:09] going to do this
[1:13:11] because he was definitely not going to
[1:13:13] do it like they think
[1:13:15] he didn't do it in the days when jesus
[1:13:18] was there and on the day of pentecost
[1:13:20] peter is telling them you have to repent
[1:13:22] of that thinking
[1:13:25] see
[1:13:27] so he does the same thing
[1:13:30] so when it was time then for paul find
[1:13:32] brother jason let's go to acts 17 and
[1:13:35] we'll catch 24-31
[1:13:37] when it was time for paul
[1:13:40] to shepherd the gospel to the gentile
[1:13:42] world he would echo this exact same
[1:13:46] principle
[1:13:48] not in any way different read with me
[1:13:52] we're going to go verses 24 to 31 god
[1:13:55] that made the world
[1:13:57] and all things therein
[1:14:00] seeing that he is lord of heaven and
[1:14:02] earth dwelleth not in temples made with
[1:14:05] hands and he's talking a bunch of
[1:14:07] gentiles who who are just heathens all
[1:14:09] right he and he's trying to get him he's
[1:14:12] trying to get him to understand remember
[1:14:13] he went to mars hill
[1:14:15] and he he gets up there and they want to
[1:14:16] hear something from him because they
[1:14:17] just love to hear new juicy things
[1:14:20] they weren't interested in changing you
[1:14:22] know anything but they loved super
[1:14:24] preachers you know they would get
[1:14:26] enamored with great oratory and great
[1:14:28] speakers didn't affect their lives on
[1:14:30] fact is if he suggested they should
[1:14:31] change their lives they wanted to kill
[1:14:33] him
[1:14:33] so so paul says i noticed
[1:14:37] among all of your many shrines to all of
[1:14:40] your many gods he says i noticed that i
[1:14:43] came across a place that said to the
[1:14:45] unknown god
[1:14:46] and paul got his text just like brother
[1:14:48] branham got his text from a package of
[1:14:51] cigarettes crumbled up in the woods a
[1:14:53] thinking man's filter and here paul gets
[1:14:55] a a text
[1:14:57] from a heathen shrine to a false deity
[1:15:01] and he says
[1:15:03] to the unknown god okay what do you have
[1:15:05] to say to us sir i want to talk to you
[1:15:08] about that unknown god
[1:15:11] i want to actually identify him to you
[1:15:14] today
[1:15:15] are you ready for that oh yes we want to
[1:15:17] hear it and paul begins god that made
[1:15:20] the world and all things therein
[1:15:22] seeing that he is lord of heaven and
[1:15:24] earth dwelleth not in temples made with
[1:15:27] hands
[1:15:28] neither is worshipped with men's hands
[1:15:31] as though he needed anything seeing he
[1:15:34] giveth life to all and breath and all
[1:15:36] things see and hath made of one blood
[1:15:40] all nations of men for to dwell on all
[1:15:43] the face of the earth and hath
[1:15:44] determined the times before appointed
[1:15:47] and the bounds of their habitation
[1:15:50] that they should seek the lord if
[1:15:52] happily they might feel after him and
[1:15:55] find him though he be not far from every
[1:15:59] one of us
[1:16:01] for in him we live
[1:16:03] and move
[1:16:04] and have our being
[1:16:06] as certain also of your own poet uh have
[1:16:11] said for we are also his offspring
[1:16:14] for as much then paul is now going to
[1:16:17] conclude he's going to sum up
[1:16:19] for as much then as we are the offspring
[1:16:21] of god we ought not to think that the
[1:16:24] godhead is like unto gold or silver or
[1:16:26] stone graven by art and man's device
[1:16:30] and the times of this ignorance god
[1:16:33] winked at
[1:16:34] see because it was ignorance
[1:16:37] but now
[1:16:38] see here he's trying to convince his own
[1:16:40] nation
[1:16:42] his own nation to say listen you had
[1:16:44] 1600 years of tradition
[1:16:47] i'm trying to get you to understand that
[1:16:50] you did that under ignorance god used it
[1:16:52] moses gave it to you it worked
[1:16:55] the traditions of the fathers was fine
[1:16:58] until it finished its course and god
[1:17:00] wasn't going to use it anymore
[1:17:02] that's where we've arrived at today god
[1:17:05] has worked down through the church ages
[1:17:06] and he's work he's moved through great
[1:17:08] and mighty men and even they raised up
[1:17:11] organizations and even god found his
[1:17:13] children within there and saved them out
[1:17:15] of there no problem
[1:17:17] but now watch what paul is saying and
[1:17:19] the times of this ignorance god winked
[1:17:21] at but now if i say now
[1:17:25] commandeth not asking he commandeth all
[1:17:30] men
[1:17:31] jew and gentile
[1:17:33] all men
[1:17:34] everywhere to repent
[1:17:38] now
[1:17:39] in everything he named he didn't name
[1:17:42] one thing about adultery fornication
[1:17:45] liars covetous cruise breakers murderers
[1:17:48] he's talking about the worship and the
[1:17:50] approach to god
[1:17:52] and he's saying i have an announcement
[1:17:54] to the world i'm i'm i'm shepherding the
[1:17:57] gospel from the jews my countrymen who
[1:18:00] have rejected it and i'm shepherding at
[1:18:02] this now over and you might see me going
[1:18:04] to the gentiles this is why
[1:18:07] you should come along israel come along
[1:18:10] my countrymen because god's not staying
[1:18:12] back under that law anymore sixteen
[1:18:15] hundred years of tradition is now of no
[1:18:17] value
[1:18:19] its value is that it's it's served
[1:18:21] imagery that i can build new testament
[1:18:23] teaching off of but we're not worshiping
[1:18:26] there in fact is if if you go from here
[1:18:28] today and teach anyone they need to be
[1:18:30] circumcised then you have bypassed
[1:18:33] christ
[1:18:34] you've made calvary of no effect to the
[1:18:36] people see
[1:18:38] so this was radical
[1:18:41] this was
[1:18:42] this was
[1:18:43] this there was no way
[1:18:45] that the masses were going to accept
[1:18:48] this
[1:18:50] there would be a few elected that would
[1:18:53] there would always be an elect lady in
[1:18:56] the earth there would always be god has
[1:18:59] always had a representation in the earth
[1:19:03] and for 2 000 years and i'm here to tell
[1:19:05] you you're it today
[1:19:08] you're it today and our message is the
[1:19:10] same as john our message is the same as
[1:19:13] peter our message is the same as paul
[1:19:16] it's time for the restoration of the
[1:19:20] bride tree what's going to happen she's
[1:19:23] going to get a body change she's leaving
[1:19:25] the earth
[1:19:26] what do i need to do to get in repent
[1:19:30] repent of your thinking repent of your
[1:19:33] error on the promise say well what about
[1:19:37] all their adultery and lying don't worry
[1:19:39] you don't have to change none of that
[1:19:40] stuff get the holy ghost and it'll
[1:19:43] change all of that for you
[1:19:47] this gospel has never been a gospel
[1:19:49] trying to force a living stan a
[1:19:52] a certain kind of standard on us the
[1:19:54] gospel has standards but it's but it's a
[1:19:56] consequence of a new birth it's only
[1:19:59] listing and that way it's a barometer to
[1:20:01] you so that you can know where you are
[1:20:04] spiritually in christ if you have
[1:20:06] overcome the world there's nothing it's
[1:20:09] impossible for you to do that unless
[1:20:11] there has been a supernatural power come
[1:20:14] down and wash your mind and change your
[1:20:17] heart and give you the holy ghost that's
[1:20:20] the only way you can see the word of god
[1:20:25] and then that
[1:20:27] life in you
[1:20:28] produces godly living
[1:20:31] not you
[1:20:33] in fact is it so not you that you'll
[1:20:36] even still stumble and make mistakes and
[1:20:37] you'll have to go back and repent again
[1:20:39] but be of good cheer
[1:20:41] he that will repent god is faithful and
[1:20:43] just to forgive
[1:20:45] oh i'm so thankful for that
[1:20:47] i'm so thankful for that friends we have
[1:20:50] an advocate christ jesus
[1:20:54] so paul has made it so clear
[1:20:57] see
[1:20:58] so so now
[1:21:00] he says uh give me that 31st verse one
[1:21:03] more time brother jason uh i think we
[1:21:05] stopped too soon let me uh let i did l
[1:21:08] did i stop at 24. i know i stopped at um
[1:21:12] i stopped at um
[1:21:15] at 30. i did you're right all right
[1:21:17] let's read 30 and 31 again and the times
[1:21:20] of this ignorance
[1:21:22] god winked at
[1:21:23] but now commandeth all men everywhere to
[1:21:27] repent verse 31
[1:21:29] because
[1:21:31] there's a big reason why everybody needs
[1:21:33] to repent
[1:21:35] because he god
[1:21:36] hath appointed a day
[1:21:41] he hath appointed a day
[1:21:44] i didn't appoint it
[1:21:46] paul didn't point it
[1:21:48] peter john
[1:21:49] moses they didn't appoint it
[1:21:51] god appointed
[1:21:53] a day
[1:21:54] william branham didn't appoint it you
[1:21:56] didn't appoint it
[1:21:58] god
[1:22:00] hath appointed a day
[1:22:02] in which he
[1:22:04] will judge
[1:22:05] the world
[1:22:07] in righteousness
[1:22:09] by that man
[1:22:11] whom he hath ordained
[1:22:13] whereof he hath given assurance unto all
[1:22:16] men
[1:22:17] in that he hath raised him from
[1:22:21] the dead
[1:22:23] so there should be no doubt if you
[1:22:27] you know the the muslim faith their
[1:22:30] their messenger is still in his tomb
[1:22:35] i'm sorry if you think the buddha is
[1:22:37] noble which i'm sure is a nice guy he's
[1:22:40] still in his tomb
[1:22:42] there is only one man who was ever able
[1:22:45] to lay his life down
[1:22:47] and himself pick it back up again and he
[1:22:50] did and it's jesus
[1:22:53] amen
[1:22:54] and therefore god has so proven it to
[1:22:57] the world by that empty tomb
[1:22:59] that now you should take and have
[1:23:02] confidence in this fact this divine fact
[1:23:06] i don't care history changes the not not
[1:23:09] the history but the the the telling of
[1:23:11] it changes
[1:23:13] science changes
[1:23:15] amen well what they know now compared to
[1:23:17] what they used to know then most of it's
[1:23:19] turned upside down
[1:23:20] see
[1:23:21] and but but here's something that
[1:23:23] doesn't change at all when god declares
[1:23:26] something it's never going to change
[1:23:29] and therefore since he raised him from
[1:23:32] the dead and proved it to the world
[1:23:34] and now he's proving it in you and i he
[1:23:37] hath appointed a day
[1:23:39] in the which he will judge the world in
[1:23:42] righteousness so as this appointed day
[1:23:46] neared then the bride in the earth at
[1:23:50] the end time
[1:23:52] as this because this appointed day is at
[1:23:54] the end
[1:23:56] and as this appointed day neared the
[1:23:59] bride in the earth would once again need
[1:24:03] the full healing of mind body and soul
[1:24:09] once again god would follow his exact
[1:24:13] same pattern he would send a prophet to
[1:24:17] declare he's here
[1:24:21] and he's moving and he's working in his
[1:24:24] people does that seem a stretch to you
[1:24:26] friend does that seem a stretch that god
[1:24:28] would do the same thing again i hope
[1:24:30] that's not a stretch in your mind
[1:24:33] i hope that you have known god in enough
[1:24:35] way that what i'm saying to you today is
[1:24:38] not some strange oh new gospel it's not
[1:24:41] a strange new gospel it's the original
[1:24:44] gospel it's the promise that god made
[1:24:47] many thousands years ago and he's come
[1:24:50] to this hour and fulfilled it and what
[1:24:52] is he doing he's restoring a bride tree
[1:24:55] and when and in that restoration he had
[1:24:58] to heal our minds he had to heal our
[1:25:01] minds of wrong thinking of
[1:25:03] denominational thinking of whatever the
[1:25:05] social fabric of the nation is feeling
[1:25:08] you know whether it's the far right or
[1:25:10] the far left they're they're all wrong
[1:25:14] this is the uh that's why i'm not a
[1:25:16] democrat or a republican i'm a christian
[1:25:21] hallelujah
[1:25:23] i i'm not a i'm not a race i'm a son of
[1:25:26] god
[1:25:27] amen god has made of one blood he's
[1:25:30] enjoined us all back to abraham
[1:25:32] hallelujah
[1:25:33] glory to god that's what we believe in
[1:25:35] here today that's why we have access to
[1:25:38] the power of god
[1:25:44] once again
[1:25:46] he would follow his pattern
[1:25:49] he would send a prophet
[1:25:52] now
[1:25:54] i i hope that's not a stretch to you
[1:25:55] today because i'm going to pile some
[1:25:57] responsibility on you this morning
[1:26:01] and
[1:26:02] it's on me too
[1:26:06] there has never been
[1:26:08] now
[1:26:09] i'm i'm
[1:26:11] maybe making my last turn and i'm gonna
[1:26:14] head for the finish line
[1:26:18] there has never been a time
[1:26:22] in the history of mankind
[1:26:26] when the family of god
[1:26:30] so
[1:26:31] needs
[1:26:32] so
[1:26:33] desperately needs to have
[1:26:36] an active
[1:26:38] and lively
[1:26:40] token
[1:26:41] on display
[1:26:45] you know why the appointed day is coming
[1:26:49] appointed day is already dropping around
[1:26:52] us
[1:26:54] and it makes our heart bleed because
[1:26:56] billions
[1:26:58] with a b
[1:27:00] billions
[1:27:02] will perish
[1:27:05] only an elect few will escape it
[1:27:09] now a nice large contingency will
[1:27:12] survive in israel a nice larger probably
[1:27:15] much larger contingency of gentiles will
[1:27:17] survive going through a tribulation and
[1:27:19] give their lives
[1:27:21] and receive eternal life at the judgment
[1:27:23] bar but i don't want to i don't want on
[1:27:26] that train because i might get there and
[1:27:27] lose my case
[1:27:29] i want to know that all my sins have
[1:27:30] already gone ahead of me
[1:27:32] and by the time i get there it's just
[1:27:34] brother jason take your take your seat
[1:27:36] on the throne oh i don't need to go oh
[1:27:38] no no jesus already stood down there for
[1:27:40] you your whole life now you go up here
[1:27:42] and sit with him
[1:27:45] hallelujah
[1:27:47] i i'm part of the restoration of the
[1:27:48] pride tree
[1:27:50] it's not just the church the church goes
[1:27:52] to the tribulation but the bride is
[1:27:54] called out of the church
[1:27:56] come up higher john that's what he heard
[1:27:58] in revelation 4
[1:28:00] caught off of the earth caught into the
[1:28:03] presence of god
[1:28:05] see
[1:28:06] and so of course not um
[1:28:09] not not
[1:28:10] not not in the in the temple of god
[1:28:13] because that nobody can go there until
[1:28:14] the judgment is over we meet christ in
[1:28:16] the air you read revelation 15 and 16
[1:28:19] you'll see all of that the the temple of
[1:28:21] heaven there's not they're not there
[1:28:24] the the seven judgment
[1:28:27] seven vile angels came out of there
[1:28:29] which of course would be the seven
[1:28:31] messengers to the gentile age because
[1:28:33] they carried a message of life and a
[1:28:35] message of judgment because it was a
[1:28:36] ministry of the son of man amen that's
[1:28:38] basic teaching and so so we realize that
[1:28:41] it is this message that will judge the
[1:28:43] seventh age
[1:28:45] and and and you say well my goodness why
[1:28:48] do the the foolish virgin have to go
[1:28:50] through such a horrible tribulation they
[1:28:52] didn't have to do that in during the
[1:28:53] ages yeah but they didn't have a message
[1:28:55] like this
[1:28:57] this age is guilty of of violating the
[1:28:59] greatest message since the days of jesus
[1:29:02] and so for that they're going to have to
[1:29:04] go through and suffer three and a half
[1:29:05] years of terrible torment and you know
[1:29:07] what's going to bring that judgment
[1:29:08] those seven those seven ages why did why
[1:29:10] do you think when when that cloud
[1:29:12] appeared over his head brother branham
[1:29:13] says what made that what now what does
[1:29:15] the white cloud mean judge
[1:29:17] and what made the cloud seven angels
[1:29:20] amen so so we see in revelation 15 that
[1:29:23] and revelation 16 these angels
[1:29:26] in linen they're absolutely correlates
[1:29:29] bible imagery of the messengers that he
[1:29:31] sent because their forever who received
[1:29:34] their message in their age received life
[1:29:37] and whoever rejected it then god dropped
[1:29:39] god he says god gathered brother m says
[1:29:42] god gathered all of his elect and took
[1:29:44] and laid him asleep and laid the
[1:29:46] messenger asleep and he dropped a
[1:29:48] temporary plague
[1:29:50] see but the vials are full that's full
[1:29:52] it's not a temporary it's not partial
[1:29:54] like under the trumpets a third of this
[1:29:56] a third of that a third of this a third
[1:29:57] of that that's because it's in prior
[1:29:59] prior to the tribulation but in the
[1:30:01] tribulation it's the vials
[1:30:04] and that's why the trumpets and the
[1:30:05] vials correlate
[1:30:06] if you ever go and read them side by
[1:30:08] side they're identical not that one's a
[1:30:09] fulfillment of the other it's just that
[1:30:11] god that would be impossible it's just
[1:30:14] that god is operating in the same way if
[1:30:16] i could say it like that god is
[1:30:17] operating in the same way and so the
[1:30:19] world that is rejecting this message
[1:30:21] today
[1:30:22] keep pleading with them
[1:30:24] keep pleading with them keep pleading
[1:30:26] with them because this same message if
[1:30:28] they keep rejecting it's going to judge
[1:30:30] them in the tribulation period
[1:30:32] so let us have a heart to reach out
[1:30:34] don't give up don't give up don't give
[1:30:36] up
[1:30:37] keep pressing keep loving keep reaching
[1:30:40] keep praying it's not over yet we can
[1:30:43] still find some go into the hedges and
[1:30:46] the highways of your life
[1:30:49] and compel them
[1:30:51] to come
[1:30:53] wow i didn't mean to get sidetracked
[1:30:54] this morning but
[1:30:56] but i i was actually going to maybe do
[1:30:58] that at the beginning but then i changed
[1:30:59] my mind and then i just felt to stab at
[1:31:01] it as i went by dr like a drive-by
[1:31:08] let's repeat this statement again
[1:31:11] because of the appointed day
[1:31:13] the appointed day
[1:31:16] as i've said to you before
[1:31:19] catastrophic
[1:31:21] cataclysmic judgments
[1:31:24] are rushing to meet us
[1:31:26] and the only way out is
[1:31:30] up
[1:31:32] up
[1:31:36] consequently there has never been a time
[1:31:38] in history
[1:31:40] the history of all humanity
[1:31:43] when the family of god so desperately
[1:31:46] needs to have an active
[1:31:48] and lively
[1:31:50] token
[1:31:51] on display
[1:31:53] you literally are the light of the world
[1:31:57] you literally are the pathway to
[1:32:00] someone's redemption
[1:32:01] now you can't redeem them you're the
[1:32:03] pathway to it you're the vessel god will
[1:32:05] use whomsoever sins you remit or
[1:32:08] remitted and whosoever is your retainer
[1:32:09] retained now don't take the catholic
[1:32:11] version of that that's not that's not us
[1:32:13] putting on black robes and sitting in
[1:32:15] the confessional booth that's you taking
[1:32:17] the gospel to them and trying to
[1:32:19] persuade them of the things of god and
[1:32:21] listen friends here's a beautiful thing
[1:32:25] they might can't understand this but
[1:32:27] they might understand you
[1:32:31] either way that would still lead them to
[1:32:32] redemption because if they could catch
[1:32:35] it in you and god changed their heart
[1:32:37] then they would understand it here
[1:32:41] there's never been a more important time
[1:32:44] we are at the appointed day your life
[1:32:47] should be a lively token it should be an
[1:32:50] active token you should not just be a
[1:32:53] flame you should be a burning blazing
[1:32:56] flame because the whole world is in
[1:33:00] darkness
[1:33:02] according to prophecy
[1:33:05] if there was ever a time if there was
[1:33:08] ever a time
[1:33:10] to show
[1:33:11] the love of god
[1:33:13] it's now
[1:33:16] if there was ever a time friends
[1:33:18] for you to be a beacon of hope
[1:33:22] if there was ever a time you know i was
[1:33:24] thinking about
[1:33:26] my daughter-in-law's testimony there in
[1:33:27] the school and the heart she has for
[1:33:29] those students if there was ever a time
[1:33:32] that we should be a beacon of hope
[1:33:34] a light in a dark world uh a a a a
[1:33:38] bastion of of strength and and faith and
[1:33:42] love and compassion it ought to be now
[1:33:46] see
[1:33:47] if there was ever a time when our hearts
[1:33:50] were to be filled with compassion if
[1:33:52] there was ever a time when we were
[1:33:55] willing to go
[1:33:56] into the hedges and into the highways of
[1:33:59] our daily life
[1:34:00] our daily life listen friends it's not
[1:34:02] just the cities and the streets it's the
[1:34:04] hedges and highways this is where the
[1:34:06] rubber meets the road this is where we
[1:34:08] live this is where we work this is where
[1:34:10] we shop this is this is us walking up
[1:34:12] and down the streets
[1:34:16] see if there was ever a time
[1:34:21] when we are to
[1:34:25] express the love and the compassion of
[1:34:27] christ
[1:34:28] in the hedges and highways of our lives
[1:34:30] and compel them
[1:34:33] to come
[1:34:34] to the feast
[1:34:36] it's now
[1:34:39] it's now do you believe that
[1:34:44] we're to be a burning light
[1:34:48] to light the darkness as the end looms
[1:34:51] it's it's irreversible
[1:34:53] and it's
[1:34:55] listen it's
[1:34:56] it's not up to you to decide
[1:34:59] i mean look
[1:35:00] i mean i already know
[1:35:02] this the same jesus
[1:35:05] that said
[1:35:06] you know go out and he sent him two by
[1:35:08] two and he sent him and i said i send
[1:35:09] you a sheep among wolves and he sent
[1:35:11] them out and and and at and and in
[1:35:13] pentecost he would scatter them and send
[1:35:15] them to the four corners of the of the
[1:35:17] world
[1:35:18] not that jesus expected the gospel would
[1:35:22] change the world save the world and and
[1:35:24] cancel the appointed day
[1:35:28] amen
[1:35:29] the appointed day wasn't going to get
[1:35:30] canceled because they started preaching
[1:35:32] the gospel that's a fact of scripture
[1:35:36] the all-knowing god knows that the
[1:35:39] all-knowing god that's why he could
[1:35:41] write it in the way he did in in the in
[1:35:43] the in the book of revelation
[1:35:46] that that the that there comes a time on
[1:35:48] this appointed day when
[1:35:50] when the sea gives up its dead and
[1:35:53] all the
[1:35:55] the the population of the earth both
[1:35:58] small and great
[1:36:00] stood before him who sat upon the throne
[1:36:02] and the heavens peeled back like a
[1:36:04] scroll me god opened up his giant tv
[1:36:06] screen that's going to play out their
[1:36:07] lives and even their thoughts and
[1:36:09] motives this you're talking about an
[1:36:10] epic event
[1:36:12] it's it's hard to get the scale there's
[1:36:14] no way your mind could even grasp the
[1:36:16] scale of what that's going to be
[1:36:18] billions upon billions upon billions
[1:36:20] down through all the ages are coming to
[1:36:22] the appointed day
[1:36:25] so we know that
[1:36:27] and and you shouldn't you shouldn't go
[1:36:29] out
[1:36:30] imagining you're going to save everybody
[1:36:32] you talk to you just get your feelings
[1:36:33] crushed and then you go hide in a hole
[1:36:36] but the the
[1:36:37] the reward is too great and the need is
[1:36:40] too great to hide we can't hide
[1:36:43] stop hiding stop yeah you need to take
[1:36:45] the scripture and says i'm not ashamed
[1:36:47] of the gospel of jesus christ for it is
[1:36:50] the power of god unto salvation be bold
[1:36:53] hallelujah be brave go forward let your
[1:36:57] light shine
[1:36:58] don't be afraid they're going to the
[1:37:00] world in majority is going to think
[1:37:02] you're crazy they always have they
[1:37:03] always will that's just that's just
[1:37:05] fallen man that's the curse of sin
[1:37:07] that's what it is i mean in the days of
[1:37:10] of noah the whole world the bible says
[1:37:12] they covered sinful men covered the face
[1:37:14] of the earth and all their hearts and
[1:37:16] minds were evil continually and and god
[1:37:18] said send them a prophet
[1:37:21] that's divine interpreter of the word of
[1:37:22] god and he sends them a prophet and
[1:37:24] didn't do you know he didn't just do
[1:37:26] like brother branham 33 years of
[1:37:28] ministry noah had 120 years preaching
[1:37:30] that
[1:37:32] and at the end of it all only a hundred
[1:37:34] only eight people
[1:37:36] got on the boat got on the ark
[1:37:39] and and you say well that's pretty
[1:37:41] narrow out of the out of the whole face
[1:37:43] of the whole earth of all the population
[1:37:44] how many billions were there i don't
[1:37:45] know
[1:37:46] the face of the earth was covered with
[1:37:48] them
[1:37:49] and i know only eight people got on you
[1:37:51] say man that's pretty narrow that's
[1:37:52] nothing
[1:37:53] he only took one in a rapture
[1:37:56] only enoch only one human being out of
[1:37:58] all the face of the earth covered with
[1:38:00] people you say god said that's pretty
[1:38:03] cold of god no god god preached to him
[1:38:05] 120 years and pleaded with them and told
[1:38:08] them it's coming it's coming it's coming
[1:38:11] get in the safety why will you die don't
[1:38:14] die see
[1:38:16] but god only built the ark so so big
[1:38:19] it's only going to hold so many people
[1:38:20] because god already knows how many he's
[1:38:21] going to get on it
[1:38:22] don't tell me he doesn't have
[1:38:23] predestination if he doesn't how does he
[1:38:25] give no other dimensions 120 years
[1:38:26] before anybody gets on
[1:38:29] how does he give how does he give john
[1:38:31] the dimensions of the of the new
[1:38:32] jerusalem i know it's large yeah it's
[1:38:34] big half the united states and 1500
[1:38:36] miles straight up
[1:38:38] i get that four point some odd million
[1:38:40] almost five million uh surface acres of
[1:38:44] land
[1:38:45] that's pretty big
[1:38:47] but i mean if god how did god give him
[1:38:49] the dimensions two thousand years ago if
[1:38:51] he doesn't know how many is going to
[1:38:52] live in it
[1:38:54] see so be sensible see don't don't be
[1:38:58] don't be children be
[1:38:59] be mature children of god and understand
[1:39:01] they they they didn't receive it in mass
[1:39:04] they didn't receive did they receive
[1:39:05] john and master they received jesus in
[1:39:07] mass did they receive the apostles in
[1:39:09] mass no
[1:39:11] they never have they never will that's
[1:39:12] not the point that's not on me that's
[1:39:14] not on you
[1:39:16] what's on me is to carry the gospel to
[1:39:18] go into the streets and the cities and
[1:39:20] go into the hedges and the highways and
[1:39:22] let your little light shine
[1:39:24] hallelujah see
[1:39:26] and so you know it's
[1:39:28] it's it's amazing how that
[1:39:31] you know when we talk about
[1:39:35] you know it's one thing to love a
[1:39:37] message
[1:39:39] if i'm standing here today and i'm going
[1:39:41] to close in just a few minutes i i'm
[1:39:43] feeling myself coming to the finish line
[1:39:45] i already know i won't get done so i'm
[1:39:46] not going to try
[1:39:50] it's it's one thing
[1:39:53] for all of us to
[1:39:54] and i mean i had to grapple with this oh
[1:39:56] it's great we can talk about
[1:40:00] go out with love and compassion
[1:40:02] see
[1:40:03] go out as a burning light go and take
[1:40:05] the love of god to the world see
[1:40:08] but but remember
[1:40:11] it's the
[1:40:12] opposite of compassion
[1:40:15] if your demonstration is carnality
[1:40:22] tell me and talk to me about
[1:40:25] let's love everybody let's show them
[1:40:27] compassion you know what i'm going to
[1:40:29] say to that amen hallelujah how about we
[1:40:31] go do it
[1:40:35] but it's the opposite
[1:40:38] of love and compassion if your light
[1:40:40] that's shining is is if your flame is
[1:40:44] lukewarm
[1:40:46] at the time when it's supposed to be the
[1:40:49] rising of the sun
[1:40:51] our flame is supposed to be the rising
[1:40:53] of the sun
[1:40:54] and if your light is a lukewarm light
[1:40:57] how is that love
[1:40:59] how is that compassion i'm going to tell
[1:41:01] you that kind of compassion is of the
[1:41:04] world it's what the devil wants you to
[1:41:07] believe he wants the world to believe it
[1:41:09] that it doesn't matter oh it matters i'm
[1:41:12] here to tell you it matters let us go
[1:41:15] out and fill our streets with love let
[1:41:17] us go into the hedges and the highways
[1:41:19] with compassion but let us be honest let
[1:41:22] us be flaming let us have the token on
[1:41:24] display
[1:41:26] because that's what god can get behind
[1:41:29] in your life
[1:41:30] he's not going to get behind
[1:41:32] lukewarmness he's not going to get
[1:41:33] behind carnality you're you're you're
[1:41:36] living a lie to the people
[1:41:39] that's why i said now now i'm circling
[1:41:41] back if there was ever a time in the
[1:41:44] history of humanity because the
[1:41:46] approaching day is upon us if there was
[1:41:48] ever a time that your your token should
[1:41:51] be on fire it should be on display the
[1:41:54] love of god should be compelling you if
[1:41:57] there was ever a time it's this time
[1:42:03] it's now
[1:42:05] here in may 2022
[1:42:08] we don't even know if there will be a
[1:42:10] 2023.
[1:42:11] we don't even know if this year will
[1:42:14] finish out we don't even know if this
[1:42:16] month will finish out you don't even
[1:42:18] have a guarantee of life tomorrow
[1:42:23] oh i want to take
[1:42:24] i want to say lord god let me right now
[1:42:27] let me right now i want to take love to
[1:42:29] the world i want to take compassion
[1:42:31] there's never been a more important day
[1:42:33] this world needs a healing of its mind
[1:42:36] and god is wanting you to be a gospel
[1:42:39] preacher and take the revelation of the
[1:42:42] word that the people might can't
[1:42:44] understand it in here but they can
[1:42:45] understand it here
[1:42:47] they know what they see they know what
[1:42:50] they're around don't think they don't
[1:42:52] i'm gonna tell you something friends
[1:42:53] that's the kind of life that has the
[1:42:54] power of god in it and for me it's that
[1:42:57] or bust
[1:42:58] it's that i mean it's it's that or it's
[1:43:00] heaven or bust
[1:43:01] hallelujah i want the whole measure of
[1:43:03] the token life i want i want to have
[1:43:06] compassion on the world
[1:43:09] but i want to have honest compassion
[1:43:13] how about you
[1:43:15] stand with me friends we'll stop there
[1:43:17] i'm i got more to
[1:43:19] say i didn't i thought i might finish
[1:43:21] and i
[1:43:22] found out pretty quickly i wouldn't be
[1:43:23] able to
[1:43:25] i love him
[1:43:28] and he loves me
[1:43:30] and he
[1:43:31] loves the world
[1:43:34] he so loved the world
[1:43:36] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:43:40] i mean what more could he do
[1:43:43] how brother branham takes that whole

[1:44:12] bible and so see jesus cared about that
[1:44:14] person god cared about that person

[1:44:23] loses his mind goes insane
[1:44:25] and and it's you know what you know what
[1:44:27] done it it's because he had a complex in
[1:44:29] his mind that he couldn't accept the
[1:44:31] forgiveness of
[1:44:32] god he couldn't accept the freedom that
[1:44:35] god gave him and he comes back and he's
[1:44:37] just sitting there in a stupor and the
[1:44:39] poor newlywed bride she's crying her
[1:44:41] eyes out
[1:44:42] because her life's ruined she's she's
[1:44:45] now connected to a man who's a nut case
[1:44:48] and and brother branham has to bring him

[1:48:38] don't let the world
[1:48:41] go off into a tribulation
[1:48:43] and never have never have someone to
[1:48:46] demonstrate to them
[1:48:48] that you're not in manmade systems you
[1:48:50] you never have been
[1:48:52] but the world is sowed over in it lord
[1:48:55] in the masses overwhelmingly nearly a
[1:48:57] hundred percent only a small
[1:49:00] small little
[1:49:02] elect lady and a small remnant of the
[1:49:04] woman's seed
[1:49:06] they'll see past that in the in the
[1:49:08] tribulation they won't take the mark of
[1:49:10] the beast thank god somehow lord it'll
[1:49:12] they'll come to their senses
[1:49:15] but there's a little tiny bride lord
[1:49:16] that's made preparations now
[1:49:19] to not go into that judgment why because
[1:49:22] we've accepted the word which is a
[1:49:24] bleeding word which then lord is what
[1:49:28] forgives our sins
[1:49:30] omits our transgressions it it
[1:49:33] gives us a new birth we now father live
[1:49:36] according to the life of the son of god
[1:49:39] that life that i live now
[1:49:41] that faith that i have is the faith of
[1:49:43] the son of god not just faith in him not
[1:49:45] his faith in him many good people have a
[1:49:47] faith in him they don't have the faith
[1:49:49] of him they don't have his literal faith
[1:49:51] his actual life they just have a
[1:49:54] conscious faith human faith and a belief
[1:49:56] in him
[1:49:58] and that's enough to give them a start
[1:49:59] but help us to show them the rest of the
[1:50:01] trip the rest of the journey the rest of
[1:50:04] the way to redemption
[1:50:06] grant it to us lord that's our great
[1:50:09] desire as a church as bethel tabernacle
