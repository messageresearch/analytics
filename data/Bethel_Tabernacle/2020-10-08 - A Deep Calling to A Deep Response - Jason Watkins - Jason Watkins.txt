tank up amen praise the lord i like these midweek services it gives me an opportunity i've been thinking about it all day got in the truck to drive here and was just excited because amen i'm preaching tonight and i wanted to and so praise the lord we're going to invite you right into the scripture here this evening and i want to go to the 143rd psalm psalms 143. it might surprise you that i'm going to use psalms 143 because that the title that i would like by the help of the lord to take tonight is a deep calling to a deep response and you might well imagine that i would re take brother branham's text from the psalms on the as the deep calleth unto the deep uh but we're not going to take that as our text tonight we've got a couple of quotes from brother brown preached that sermon several times i think maybe three or four maybe five times and we're going to take one or two quotes out of a couple of those sermons but amen i felt inspired to take my thought tonight from psalms 143 amen you have it say amen we've got just a few requests that i have tonight so if you have any if you're at home streaming and you have any requests just send it to me direct at whatsapp and i'll check at the end of the service to see what has perhaps come in i have two that have already come to me we're not going to hold you along tonight but i want to deliver my heart that'll be okay amen praise the lord psalms 143 hear my prayer o lord give ear to my supplications in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness and enter not into judgment with thy servant and that wonderful for in thy sight shall no man living be justified for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he hath smitten my life down to the ground he hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate i remember the days of old i meditate on all thy works i muse on the works of the work of thy hands i stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land sila hear me speedily o lord my spirit faileth hide not thy face from me lest i be like unto them that go down into the pit cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way wherein i should walk for i lift up my soul unto thee deliver me o lord from mine enemies i flee unto thee to hide me teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness quicken me o lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble and for thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for i am thy servant amen what a beautiful reading from psalms 143 this is david writing we'll give you just a little bit of background in a minute let's pray master we thank you for your word here this evening and lord i stand here tonight and father i'm i'm i'm not responsible for this sermon i take no credit for it nor do i bear any responsibility for it all the credit goes to you because it's your responsibility and these are your people and lord all i can do is set myself aside throughout the day as i have sat quietly and meditate on your word as i have come forth praying as i have read your word as we have read it together and call jesus on the scene take the bread of life lord let it be real to the people like it was to me father some weeks ago this sermon has just been simmering on a back burner weeks ago in the early morning hours father before the sun was ever up i sat weeping reading this psalm lord it's meant so much to me every time i read it so now tonight at long last to my delight i finally get to preach it i commit it now to you lord in jesus name amen god bless your friends as you're seated it's wonderful to be a christian isn't it brother branham you know i love quoting it and brother branham says it and with such a feeling in his heart and he just says oh i don't know what i could do if i wasn't a christian my when i when i think about the turmoil of the world and i think about what what humanity is facing today if i didn't have this message and this gospel and the hope and the spirit of god moving in our lives wow friends i mean you know sister gene and i we've talked so many times about you know how does the world cope without christ without this word and you know i it always just comes to me and i say you know mom they're they're not coping that's the whole thing that's why there's a epidemic of drugs and alcohol and abuse and and families breaking up and madness and and the politics and the and the perversion and the laws and the schools and and it's just uh you know all on the streets everywhere to where there's such contamination really friends you can't go anywhere and escape it you find that everywhere you turn that you're gonna find some semblance you know i'm glad we've got a church we can come into where we can just kind of let off the pressure a little bit amen amen monitors down just a little wee bit there for the mat um just a little hot on these monitors maybe drop the value maybe 10 15 percent so you know i'm glad that we have this here tonight and i'm glad that we have a word that we can put confidence in i appreciate a word that i can put confidence and i remember years ago i was witnessing to a very good friend of mine and i had witnessed to him before he just seemed you know that uncrackable nut and uh don't know i haven't seen him in years since we were since we were boys we were just teenagers working together you know i'd preach to him every day at work and you know he would he i i was trying to he was trying to tell me about you know his mormonism and i was trying to tell him about jesus amen and so you know i i and and and i i and so you know he i remember he wanted to have a meeting you know how they like to do they like to get you to where then they'll bring in all the big guns on you and surround you and so i was pretty young but i was had a lot of a lot of smoke in me back then and i was you know i loved a good spiritual scrap i'm a little bit ashamed of that now with some of the some of the spiritual scraps i got into you don't accomplish a whole lot just listen you don't accomplish a whole lot arguing because listen if the if the lord doesn't give them eyes to see then uh you know you're not going to be able uh excuse me here you're not going to be able to get them to see got it uh so you have to have the revelation of the lord amen and so i said to him i said greg i said you know his good friend of mine and i said because we had just sit down for probably wow probably at least an hour and you know he had his his team there and i was just there with my bible and uh you know we they got to talking about doctrine and and i just took him to task with their doctrine in the scriptures and we had we had an agreement at the beginning i won't bring any books of william branham you don't read me anything out of the book of mormon sound like a fair deal amen we just take it based on the bible we all believe the bible yes you believe it absolutely cover the cover yes all inspired yes you believe every word just as it's written absolutely it's the inspired word of god and so me and my ridiculous young arrogance you know i'm i'm you know spouting off to them well in 10 minutes i'll have you retracting that statement i mean they did in 10 minutes retract that statement but it that still wasn't the point the point was that it was you know obnoxious and rude of me to be that way because it didn't win anything uh you know it just embarrassed them and uh but you know then but then i did i felt convicted at that moment and i thought wow lord what have i really done and um i think that's where the lord because i'd been up up to that time doing it quite a bit sister debbie used to just fuss at me all the time well you know what are you accomplishing i said well you know i got to prove my point but so the lord really dealt with me and i realized friends you know and i i felt sorry for him and i just said listen fellas it's not really about convincing one another i said i just i would be sad i'm just telling you from my heart i said no all right bible's closed debate's over argument's over we should have never argued i said i'm just telling you that i'm going to pray for you because i would be very sad i'd be a sad person if if everything that i had believed my whole life and had been taught in the word of god and from the message of the hour and i had from a child been raised up like greg and these men had and somebody could come down and sit in front of me and take this book and just blow gaping holes through my doctrine i mean holes big enough you could drive a talk through and i just said i would be a very very depressed person amen so you know i stand before you tonight very glad to say you don't ever have to worry about that because i'm here to tell you that what god has sent us in this day it it cannot be resisted in this book and i have i have offered that around the world and i have never in all my years of ministering found anyone who could successfully do it and it doesn't even take long and it has nothing to do with my intelligence or your intelligence it's that god sent his intelligence aren't you glad for that so you know we can we have an anchor that's steadfast and it's sure but it's not but it's not you know i want to move in tonight to something beyond you know doctrinal clarity yes we can prove what we preach yes the doctrines can be displayed genesis to revelations no they don't log jam anywhere in the bible not one of them do and i'm glad for that but yet it takes more than that i'm glad that it can dovetail but it takes more than that i'm glad i can understand it with my mind i'm glad i can preach it to you i'm glad you can get it but it takes more than that because brother branham when he was accused of not knowing his bible very well which was pretty funny to me that brother branham didn't defend that he just said well i know the author real well because that you know the author is that's it that's all there is to to worry about is knowing the author because the author promised he would reveal his word to you he would reveal himself to you but you know friends i'm sure that you agree with me that when we when we take this idea of a deep calling for a deep response and brother branham talks about how that that you couldn't have this thirst this longing this hunger except there was something in existence to meet that or you couldn't that couldn't exist remember that and so so brother branham picks up here in the in the in one of his many times of deep call to the deep this one is in june 24 1954 and he says if he was ever around an eagle's nest you remember him telling the story there on the uh on the film deep call to the deep that's another one that he preaches in washington dc and and we find that he he tells how that he's watching that eagle remember that story through the binoculars she's way up high and he said he had been watching and all those little guys were in the nest and they were just you know terrible time until she put her wings out you remember that and they get on the wing and she brings them down sets them into the end of the pasture below and then she climbs back to the highest rock to watch them remember that and so brother branham says he's he's starting to talk about now the release that they had on this meadow and he says you know the have you ever been around an eagle's nest they make it out of sharp sticks and things and then poor little eagles was just walking on those sticks and thorns and they never know nothing else see but one day the mother spread forth her wings and they stepped on the wings and went down now he said i looked at those little fellas and they were just having a pentecostal revival they were running around on that soft grass just picking up here and chirping to one another and jumping over each other just as free as they could be and a prophet catches a contrast catches a spiritual contrast he says i thought well that's right now there is like a man in the old nest of the world knows nothing but what the devil can give him amen i mean that that's a sad statement to me that a man born he's just born in the nest of the world and all he knows is sharp sticks and sharp things to walk around on and trip on and get cut on and get bruised on and he said he knows nothing else but that sin an old nest of the world he knows nothing but that but what the devil can give him but one day god picks him up and sets him down in the shady green pastures and and and and we can you know as believers we can relate to that you know especially when we go back and we think about our lives prior to this shady green pasture when you think about your life you know and it doesn't even matter maybe you were raised in a christian home maybe you're raised you know to in a christian church maybe in a message church like like i was but you know you still realize that until you came born again you were just walking around in the prickly nest of the best that satan can give you and his best ain't very good you know i i say that to people all the time young people especially just take it from me the world has nothing to offer but sticks and stones and cuts and bruises and stabs and it's not fun and i don't care in your whatever you want to make out of it at its best level you know what it still is a depressing place life is hard and then you die that's what they say life is hard and then you die so you know there's something to be said then you know that that there's something that is so right to a believer about this story as i was saying that he you realize that you've come to something that's more than a head knowledge you've come to something that's just more than doctrinally accurate and you have to otherwise you're never gonna you're never gonna get that thirst that deep that that hunger that's never going to be met until you step on the wings of jehovah and let him take you out of the nest of the world i don't care what you accomplish until he takes you out of the nest and sets you on shady green pastures you have very little to look forward to in this life this is a a troublesome time for david the 143rd psalm the occasion of the psalm of course is david fleeing jerusalem from absalom ii samuel chapter 15 through chapter 18 a very very very sad story not going to elaborate on it tonight at all you you've no doubt read that since your days in sunday school so now david you know this is the time where where you know it's all coming due it's it's all coming time to you know the consequences of something that had been long ago in his past and he had been able to stay ahead of it you know he had he'd been able just to to keep things rolling the prophet had told him you know you're going to have a problem in your family it's going to meet you down the road but you know it's david had managed to to race ahead of it but now here comes absalom and and then even that had taken years over a decade to develop and there had been a a killing there had been a you know a sister attacked and then he murdered him and then he had to flee and then david brings him back and this goes on this goes on for years and you know it's it's it's not that david is running out of the city uh you know repenting for being a sinner at this point david has had his relationship restored to god and he's he's he's he's he's bringing about this great contrast and i think that one of the great lessons of psalms 143 is the very sharp contrast between what israel thought was righteousness amen but that versus god's actual righteousness that there is such a contrast say i'm i'm a good person i live a right kind of life let me tell you your best effort is so much lower it's filthiness to him he can't use any of your holiness he can only use his own holiness it's not that you have anything to offer him it's that we have to we we should be here tonight so grateful that that i could say nothing in my arms i bring it simply to thy cross i cling and the lord of glory would say that's enough i have nothing that's okay i have everything i i can bring you nothing i can offer you nothing i've had nothing but failures don't matter i i don't have any failures i'll give you my life that that is shady green pastures friends israel's righteousness one one commentator said that israel was learning that their righteousness would carry no freight in time trouble i thought what an amazing statement it rang in my heart israel's righteousness will carry no freight in time of trouble you know that's a lesson for us all that i'm here to tell you no amount of self-sufficiency no amount of talent and skill and education money wealth position popularity fortune and glory friends and fame nothing can equip you to get through this life amen this life has so many inherent problems you have to understand you're born into a world that's under a curse you're born into a body built from a cursed earth your soul is black and smutty and cut off from god your mind is the enemy of god and you're an alien from the commonwealth of his kingdom and then as as if that's not bad enough the world is covered over with ungodly ungodly men who have who have taken sin to levels that were almost unimaginable would have been unspeakable just decades ago i mean just in the previous century there are things today that are common common accepted that would have been almost unspeakable just a couple decades ago that's the rate of acceleration to insanity that this world is on it's on a path of self-destruction and god's going to let it he's going to let it he's not going to destroy he don't have to he'll just get out of the way and let man destroy it see so we find that you know no amount of your own ability is going to haul freight for you in time of trouble i want you to absorb that if you're young here tonight your young people listen up close there's no amount of your abilities or skills that'll haul freight for you in time of trouble you'll find that you can't get through life you'll find yourself train wrecked shipwrecked blowed up off the side you won't be able to navigate the world is too crazy too sinful you're going to need a guide you're going to need somebody to take over your life you'll never be able to get to safe harbor amen so we find that this this this my un unfathomable distance unbridgeable if i could call it that even to try to bridge the the the difference between the righteousness of god and the best efforts of man-made righteousness now of course i think that when we look at our text here you know david no doubt is you know some of his suffering that he's going through here being chased out of jerusalem uh he's suffering you know sprang from his own sin because i mean that's pretty obvious because he's asking god not to judge him remember that so it's so i'm not i don't i don't want you to get the wrong idea when i get when i really get to where my heart is on this psalm certainly david is feeling the weight and god is letting him and god will let you and and and you know i i i i appreciate the forgiveness of my sins but i you know i would not want god to just strike it out completely out of my memory because i want to remember where he saved me from i want to remember the the craziness of going that way i want to learn from my mistakes and david is certainly learning you know he's pleading with the lord you know don't enter into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man be justified and so you know he's he's finding out that he that he can't stand you know with his own righteousness uh before god nobody can david is saying no man can stand don't take me there because i can't stand there and no man can stand in your righteousness everyone is unrighteousness is in the sight of god and so david then appealed to god to answer his prayer and this is a real turn are you ready for this david is appealing to god to answer his prayer because of god's righteousness amen because of god's faithfulness the scripture says that even even if we are unfaithful he remains faithful because he cannot deny himself do you understand how secure you are in the love of god that you're you're so far down the scale that no amount of good deeds you could ever do could get you to be judged uh you know in his in his judgment and pass the grade you'd be destroyed and so i want you to know that you're going into heaven tonight not on any righteousness that you've done but because he's righteous and because he's faithful to his family to give them his righteous so he he prays quicken me o lord as we were in verse 11. quicken me o lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble i've said that i know you've said that lord i i couldn't stand in your judgment i said you know i remember early in the morning hour sun wasn't even up and i was sitting there early reading and that lord just led me to this it was so incredible i even had a testimony to my wife later when she got up and i said you know and i i said it's so amazing to me because when i woke up early that morning and i don't remember it was a couple weeks ago probably i was praying like this and i hadn't read this since probably the last time i read through the the whole testament or the uh even even reading the whole book of psalms i think those are things you should read you know reread them and start over and read them on a regular basis and i hadn't remembered this psalm in quite a long time and and i woke up that morning and i it was on my heart brother jason it was so amazing because i woke up saying lord you know my my way to wake up is just to begin praising him immediately i'm thank you i've woke up i've got another i've got another day to serve you you know i've got my darling still with me i've life is still here there's more i can do you know i don't care what the devil's doing what's happening in the world i get to be a christian i get to serve god i get to do something for him maybe you maybe you're looking at me like i'm kooky but you're looking at a man who feels so privileged to be alive i feel so privileged with what god has called me to do oh my and i was just saying that lord and then of course there's always like you like me we're all alike you come to those you come to those moments and you say lord there's just nothing you know you're crying and there's nothing good in me and it's all you and oh lord if it happened for you and it's you and it's you and it's your mercy and it's your love and i was no good when you found me and i failed you but you keep going and you won't throw me away thank you thank you thank you and i just said lord i got nothing to offer you but a heart that loves you i got nothing to do but surrender all i can do is rely on your faithfulness and your righteousness hallelujah i was i was getting swept away as i was laying there in the bed crying and trying not to wake my wife up so early and i get out of bed and i grab my bible i go sit in the room and i open up to psalms 143 and here's david praying this very prayer not because of my righteousness because of yours not because i've been faithful i haven't but you're faithful you love me hallelujah oh friends this sermon has been so heavy on my heart for weeks lord when are you gonna let me preach it hmm we've all said that lord i can't stand in your judgment and you know if you're like me you you you're aware and you're you're so aware you're painfully aware that that even if i lived a perfect life i couldn't stand in his righteousness think about that that's that's how high his righteousness is that's how pure his life is it's flawless it's clear as crystal god is so pure he's the fountain there's no contaminant in him no shadow of turning the bible says oh all good gifts come down from above from the father of lights in whom has no shadow no variable there's no shadow of turning he's always loving he's always kind he's always just he's always full of mercy his throne is established in mercy mercy rejoiceth against judgment god is always looking to find a way to forgive you he's always looking for a way to redeem you he's always looking for a way to woo you back when you get away he'll wait he'll wait and he'll put an arm around you come back child come back child that's the love of god faithful beyond description a god that faithful i couldn't stand if i had a perfect life and i say lord if i had a perfect life i couldn't stand in your judgment so don't even take me there don't even take me there let's just not even go to your judgment at all just let me walk under the shadows of your mercy so i can relate to david amen i'm sure you can i can relate to david here help me lord help me because you love me nothing in my arms i bring no good that i've done help me because you love me i don't always feel faithful but he's always faithful amen and i say that to the lord all the time lord i'm not always faithful but you are i'm not always righteous but you're righteous and you love me you've always loved me can't can is that how you feel in your heart today oh i want to tell you if you don't know the lord jesus christ like that then let me let me pray for you tonight before you leave this building because i want to introduce you to a person who will love you no matter what through thick and thin the day and night no matter you might stumble you might fall he'll love you anyway he'll keep on loving you and when he's finished loving you he'll love you some more and when you think you can't possibly get any more love you suddenly will he's always loved me he's loved me from a child you know say wow brother jason have bad things never happened to you bad things happen to us all come on life's no better roses i'm not here on a pity party so i've had some hard knocks you know uh some of them were my own doing [Music] you say well i don't know about well okay some of them were because you didn't prevent it amen right amen amen come on some of them were because maybe you didn't do it but you also didn't prevent it you could you could have back way back here several steps back you could have made some different choices that wouldn't have got you to this point amen amen amen out there on the internet amen amen i can hear them amen brother's going to say amen for all of them you know but but but through it all i think that i can say today and i'm i believe that you can you can relate with me that through it all somehow i always knew he loved me i always get that sense from him you know i i ran as a teenager sure i ran as a young man so sometimes i still find myself running from his will amen sometimes i still find myself you know you come up and you see the lord's will for you in a certain thing and you run from that it's not exactly how you wanted it not how you planned it you know and uh too often we find ourselves come on all you holy people too often we find ourselves running from the clear commands of his word amen everybody just do this lord you see that we're just being honest tonight you know chasing my own human affections you ever done that chasing your own ambitions chasing your own ideas see i got good news for you he still loves you i have found that to be so true i have found myself chasing my own ambitions he still loves me chasing my own will he still loves me how do you know he loves you because i get corrected somebody grabs him by the arm and around and around we go oh my he loves me he won't change his heart towards me that's a beautiful thing do you say how do you know he won't change what if you do something extremely i mean brother jason come on i mean what if you really pushed it you you sure that he wouldn't stop loving you i know he wouldn't say how do you know because i found out in his secret book that he actually loved me before the foundation of the world he already loved me before i was even here he already knew all the failures i would have and he loved me at the start there's nothing i'm going to do that he isn't already aware of and he made a decision to love me i can't talk him out of it you can't talk him out of it the devil sure can't talk him out of it amen satan can't get him to change his mind but now can i turn a corner this hunger this longing this thirst like david it and i i so relate to david i'm sure when i get on the other side it's always been one of my favorite bible characters i'm sure when i get on the other side i'm going to meet him and i'm going to say hey dave you know in 2020 on october what's the date seventh i preach he's going yeah yeah you preach the sermon about yeah you had it you were right you exactly you were right on the money i know i am see and and and david's longing david's crushing all consuming hunger it wasn't coming from failure of course he had regrets he was suffering absalom chasing him out was a long line of finally caught up to him from mistakes he had made you know back years ago mistakes long ago dealt with god had already forgave him that wasn't the issue god had already forgave him it already been moved on judgment had already been passed out that you know it's reaping and sowing is not the judgment of god that reaping and sowing is the laws of nature you reap what you sow it's not god going oh boy look what you sowed i'm gonna get you god i don't have to do a thing god just put a law in nature you you sow a certain seed you're going to grow that crop exactly and god don't it's not god chasing you down i'm going to beat you over the head with your with the fruits of your sin that that's not it you're reaping your own your own rewards so judgment had already been actually judgment had already been a sign and david had lost a child over that whole debacle with bathsheba but the prophet told him your sin is put away now that's an amazing thing because there was nothing david could do do you know in the old testament there was no sacrifice david could bring for that that was willful sin there was no offering for that you couldn't bring that you he couldn't bring a lamb or a turtledove he could have brought a thousand of them it wouldn't have mattered there was no offering he could do for that willful adultery and murder he intentionally cold-blooded in the first degree with malice and forethought had a man killed and took his wife in adultery there was no nothing in moses law that could atone for that and he was supposed to die and god tells him through the prophet you're not going to die as for your sin you know what he told him as for your sin the supreme judge says he's put it away and you're not going to die however a sword will never leave your house and you're going to pay for this in in in a payment plan you're going to have to make payments all the way along you'll have a lot of trouble from this day forward and he did because he was reaping what he sowed you know if i if i could get every if i could get every child from about the age of maybe 10 11 12 years old and up to get this in your head you reap what you sow and if you so and the and the the the beauty and the the beauty and the terror at the same time is that if you reap good seed you always if you sow good seed you always reap more than you sow you sow a single seed you reap a crop with all kinds of seed but in perfect contradistinction if you sow bad seed if you sow to the wind you know what you reap you reap a tornado oh you saw i only sowed to the wind right but the laws of reaping sowing and reaping mean that whatever you plant comes back in a much multiplied stage depends on which side you sow it in everything you do is a seed everything you think is a seed everything you say is a seed and it grows a crop remember that it grows a crop your best bet if you've got a truckload of bad seed that you sowed you better thank god for the story of esther yeah thank god for esther because you know what esther could do they couldn't undo that once the king had said that made the command there was no way to undo it the laws of the means and persians couldn't be undone it's like god i'm god i changed not i can't take it back i've said you reap what you sow i can't undo that for you even though i love you so you know what the king told he said now here's what you do he said you'll go out and you'll you'll sow new seed over the top of that old seed and here's what it'll do instead of on on friday when everybody gets to kill you and all your people on thursday the day before y'all can go kill all of your enemies so that when friday comes and that law comes into force you ain't got no enemies so what did what did he do the the the next seed that was sown destroyed the effect of the first so if you've got a i just gave you that today if you've got a lot of bad seed just start sowing good seed on top of that and when that when that good seed comes up it'll destroy the effect of that that that's the one beautiful thing that god provides for his family but david is not running in in sin he's this he hasn't had a recent failure this kind of longing this hunger's not coming from that this deep calling doesn't come from some from some recent failure in david's life david the judgment had been dealt with just like me just like you i i say here i say yes i've i've i've had plenty of times where you know i was running as a teenager running as a young man or even admitting here that i don't even sometimes now find myself uh you know running the opposite away of god's will for my life but but it's not because i'm a secret sinner my whole life's under the blood thank god aren't you glad today that you can stand here not be a hypocrite and say i'm a christian do you make mistakes of course i do but that's that's not in my heart to do that i'm under the blood i've been changed i got a new nature i don't even want to do that stuff anymore and so my whole life is under the blood yes we've all been sinners in our unconverted past and maybe as i said earlier maybe even raised up in a church like me may be raised up as a in a believer's home like me but but at times also you know a secret sinner in the times before we were converted amen see and and that's why david is saying enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified but that's not my life for many years now that's not my life i'm not a sinner anymore so then so then why do we have verse four this spirit where he feels so overwhelmed therefore in verse four therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate he's not this isn't the cry of a sinful man trying to repent because he's being chased out of it out of his capital like i say that sin has long ago been dealt with no friends no i'm here to tell you today i know by experience this is a different hunger this isn't coming from from regret this is a different hunger this isn't coming from fresh sin this is a different hunger this is a different deep calling this is a different thirst oh my david had you know when uh when when i and you say well then then what is it brother jason well i think it's in the very next verse in verse 5 i remember the days of old i meditate on all thy works i muse on the work of thy hands because you know david had gotten to a point now and maybe this is where i was the other morning early maybe this is where you are tonight or maybe where the lord is going to bring you to tonight and maybe he's about to do something very special in your heart in this service tonight because i began as a at my age now i i'm like i say i'm not a secret sinner that's long ago that's my old life but but now it's it's as if the more i know him then the more i want to know him my muse on his old ways i think about the world i think about my life i think about the faithfulness of god i've been down the road long enough now to know that god loves me i've been on this way long enough to know that i can't make him stop loving me i've been going long enough to know that he's faithful and he's just and you can trust him and that causes me to rise up with a deep call a deep hunger not because i've i've got some sin but because i i find that the more i know him the more i want to be like him i i can't rest day or night i'm not happy with where i'm at and i say but you're a christian but i want to be a better christian but you love god i want to love him more oh to love him more deep within my heart i want to know him i want to know him more i want to love him more i want to be more i want to do more for him this is where david was i think david was where we all are at times we still see too much it's where i'm at i still see too much of of me in the way you ever feel like that and that's why you come to verse six david says i stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land verse 10 teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness lead me lord into the land of uprightness this isn't this isn't david you know running running sure he's he's being deposed sure it's breaking his heart but it's it's not just at that level this is going this is going beyond something that you know that every day-to-day human existence i'm here to tell you something friends i believe that the closer that we get to the catching away the more real it's becoming the more i long for those shady green pastures i long for mama eagle to stretch out her wings and carry me off back into the oh hallelujah back to the clef of the rock so many sad scenes that and we're not here tonight to tell sad stories but the bible is filled with some regrettable times that have brought mankind to where he is today and where mankind is today is sad amen it's sad it's sad because not only is it worse than it's ever been but he's helpless to help himself out of it i think in my mind's eye back to the garden of eden brother branham if you ever hear him tell the story it's so heart-wrenching of course nobody can tell a story like brother branham he's such a master at it but i i remember the scene he describes with adam you know the sad scene adam leaving the garden with his arm around eve and walking from the garden walking from god's presence you know i i think about the the sad think of the think of the sadness that adam and eve must have felt when they discover abel's bloodied corpse imagine the pain that that would have caused i look at the sad scene here of david riding out of jerusalem weeping over a city goes up upon the mount of olives and weeps over the city of jerusalem 900 plus years later son of david is going to go up that same hill and weep over the same city a rejected king you know david had got to a point in his life where many things had you know this is psalms 143 this is a lot of years a lot of water's been under the bridge at this point and you know isn't it amazing that life can have a way sometimes and it doesn't it doesn't necessarily take a lot of years life can have a way of just grinding you down you know and i think that david surely must have felt as he's being deposed and weeping over the city and leaving you know on his on his animals and and the whole you know capital government is leaving with him and you know and and the the army generals they want him to fight and he's not going to fight he just says you know i'm just god gave me god put me here god can take me down if god wants to give it to absalom let him give it to him my life is in god's hands in in times where you're ground down by life uh one of the best places of refuge i've ever discovered is to just raise up my hands and say lord my life my times are in your hands and even if you slay me i'll trust you you know it takes quite a revelation to say that and mean it when you're you know when you're when you've reached the dead hours brother branham called it and and and and sometimes life can bring great challenges and when you've got to have that moment and it's got to be by faith and it's got to be something stronger than you it's got to come from something more than your head knowledge or more than being convinced of the doctrines and teachings you've got to be able to say though he's slaying me yet i'll trust him there's many sad disappointments in this mortal life and you know brother brandon talks about he you know in ways of say he'll say things like you know i i'm here and then when i'm over here i want to be over there and then when i'm over there i don't want to be back over here and and he says you know he said i'll i'll come back from overseas and he said i'll think my i don't i want to stay home for months and he said and then a jet plane will go over over the head and he said and my heart will be oh i want to be i need to go back to the foreign field he talks about times where you know just life i mean brother brandon was a just a human he talks about you know about your your finances and he says you know you get a little money and you think you're going to get ahead and finally going to get a little relief and he said and then something will come along and take it you know amen amen how many times we've had it and and you know he he says here he says here in questions and answers in 1964 i read this today in um in one of my devotionals i it must have been um the uh the one that brother tim dodd did i don't i think maybe book one or book two i don't remember but he says here talking about people who try to live in the rearview mirror live in their past and he says you know christians a christian don't do that a christian don't try to be what he used to be he's not looking where he's been he's looking where he's going see don't pay no attention to what you was now watch this here's something real practical for men and women don't pay no attention to what you was then you done lived that out you'll never return to it that's in the past and any man that drives life's road life's road looking through a rearview mirror is going to go to wreck so will you on this christian road see don't look back what you was look what you're going to be paul said forgetting those things which are in the past i pressed forward toward the mark of the high calling you know i i was the other day i was looking through family pictures and my that's such a warm feeling in your heart you look over old friends and old families and you know immediate and siblings and aunts and uncles and grandparents and then and then beyond that there's friends that you've known and you're there you are and they're smiling you're smiling years ago and you know as i was as i was looking back and just just going down memories laying a little bit every once in a while you know you you run into somebody and it's really it's really their past that keeps them from going forward and i've been around people like that to where they get so hung on something that happened in their past and they they get stuck there and they can't go forward and they're just maybe it's maybe it's something they did that they're under guilt maybe it's under regret maybe they're paying a heavy price uh you know i don't know i got all kinds of things i could look back over pictures and i could go wow what a happy time look at that oh yeah and then i go wow um boy that's also when wow man what's that memory wasn't there yeah you know i'm glad to be going to a place where i'm going to be no more bad memories i'm going to a place friends where everything's flawlessly perfect and you know what this might sound weird to you but i i found myself staring at all these different images of people i've known and and i thought all that that you know i i know you know that poor person you know they they were pretty close to me and i know something that happened and i know they regret it i know they repented thank god lord i was thanking god and and i just thought to myself you know jesus and and then another time elijah you know when when when when you get sometimes when god puts a call on you and then you know they want to they want to go back and worry about the dead and and the and the adage is you know let the dead bury the dead and i and i just i just thought about that in my mind and i just thought i you know i want to say to anybody who's held up maybe maybe some failure maybe some cataclysmic failure maybe maybe there's been a hard price that maybe you're even paying it right now i'm here to tell you that god still loves you and just let the dead bury the dead and quit going back there and just be done with it why don't you just tonight accept the freedom that he loves you and that he forgives you and that he doesn't want you to linger back there he wants you to go forward forward upward onward christian soldiers i think there's nothing more more limiting to to for god to be able to use our lives i tell you something friends i got plenty of mistakes without lingering on them all day long all i can do is give it to god cast it in the sea of his forgiveness and say father i love you i believe you i'm sorry what i did then but here is me now and i'm going to go forward in faith and i'm going to serve you the rest of my days i think that that's part of the longing i think that i want to say lord i don't want to sit back and linger over failure and thought and fear i want to have faith i want to have courage i want to i have a longing i have a hunger i have a thirst for more of you so just let the dead bury the dead let if if that's under the blood then to god it's dead if you've got a responsibility you're having to keep up with because of a mistake then god bless you keep up with it but don't linger back there in the failure of those kinds of things press forward children press forward let the bleach wash it all away all of it do you realize it wouldn't even been possible until the day and hour that you're living in because we have a justification that so far supersedes luther's understanding we have a bleach we have an abstract that traces your life all the way back before you were born and find you back in the mind of god and when you come forward you're one thing sons and daughters amen and all the hurts and all the disappointments and all the pains of life weeping over lost loved ones you've lost them to the grave you've lost them to the world you know what what can you do but give it to god amen what can you do why why would i stay back there and linger in the pain of it and and that's only going to keep me defeated why not hope thou and god hope thou and god david david commanded his own heart to do that hope in god see i you know there's we got enough sad stories here that every one of us could stand up here and tell the tragedies of our lives but you know we're going to a place where someday the lord brother branham said we'll sit at that table thousands of miles long that's not a fairy tale friends that's for real and he said we'll reach across to one another and we'll weep and cry and and he said the king the king the king will come out and wipe away all your tears and say don't wait no more it's all over all those words it's all over hallelujah i'm so looking forward to that hour uh when it don't weep no more it's all over oh my you know i life it life it can just be a series of tragedies and so hope in god put your heart there why would you why would you give your life to such sadness why not just give your whole heart i remember you know there at the bedside what a sad scene that was there with brother eddie slipping to the other side and the whole family we're trying to trying to you know get in just to get we it was planned we knew it when we had made the decision and you know he wasn't coming back and the lord was going to bring him on to his reward i'm glad i can stand here to go tonight and say hey y'all remember brother eddie he's still alive very much so amen and you know it was but it but but those things are sad but paul said it's not that paul said you know it's not that we don't sorrow we don't sorrow as others who have no hope sure it was hard to let him go stand holding his hand wanting him healed so bad you know to see him slip away and you know you can hear the sound and suddenly his heart stopped and and we're realizing he's gone and you know but he he wasn't gone gone he'd all he did was step up out of that broken down old skeleton frame that had wasted away didn't even probably look like brother eddie anymore and i i remember looking and i was watching sister jean and you know she just she just laid in close and just rubbed his head and i could see i couldn't hear what she was saying just saying her last words to her to the love of her life you know until i see you again and dad i love you and i i could make out a little bit and we love you and we'll see you again and and i just thought if enough that's all i had and my story ended there then i would cry every day thinking about that scene right you know you wanna you wanna you wanna hear a little you wanna hear a little inside family story that you've never heard when that happened jonathan got really weird and he he just like he just turned away and he went over to the window staring out the window and we're all crying or looking over jonathan we're crying or looking every time what is he doing and i thought well maybe he's just grieving in his own way until i got him turned around and he's smiling and he found a he found a piece and found a joy and we're like what how are you we're all crying and boo-hooing and jonathan is just like he said listen y'all he said y'all can stand here and cry all night he said but you know how papaw was he didn't stay around nowhere long he said i'll guarantee you when he stepped up out of that body he's like oh you're a bunch of crazy people i'm out of here and he said i was looking out the window to see if he was flying up over those buildings he said i know he wasn't still in the room anymore i'm here to tell you something friend there's a land beyond the river that would call the sweet forever and you know what we took a joy out of that and he's right brother eddie wouldn't do that you go to a restaurant with him you you could you could stay there all day if you wanted to when brother eddie got done he was leaving that was it when he was done he was out the door he didn't hang around i you know where we're we're all we're all crying we're all boohoo and he was already out he was already out he wasn't still in that broken down old temple he wasn't dead that temple stopped and i was glad i was glad to see him release dad wow you fought hard you stayed faithful you got a reward go rest now we'll see you soon enough anyway i'm here to tell you some friends when when the trumpet sounds the devil can look for me but i'll be out he can come and accuse me of whatever he wants i'll be gone it ain't gonna matter let the world do what it wants to do let satan have at it when the trumpets of god sounds and the dead in christ rise i will be out of here i'll be gone it ain't going to matter to me my heart is here today to say lord i want to know you more while i'm here i want my heart to know you in a supernatural way it's not about sin it's not about guilt that's already under the blood it's not about that that's not what it was with david david had come to know this god david had come it was such a personal thing to him oh he says you know i i i want to know you in this way in this way i don't want to go to your judgment i but my my heart is longing my whole inside is wanting more of you david was going to come back god was actually going to do away with absalom which didn't which broke david's heart even more and but david was going to be restored to his throne there's no weapon formed against you that can prosper let satan rage let the heathen rage the heathen's always going to rage you know i why while i'm here i'm going to have to stop but but while i'm here i want to make my life count i want to it's not that i can earn my keep i could never earn my keep what christ has done for me can never ever be repaid i can't even pay the down payment i can't even pay the interest on the loan no sense even trying to make the first payment i could never keep up for all that he's done for me but i find myself i find myself like david to say lord what does life really matter anyway as long as i have you and david is literally being chased out of his capital off of his throne he doesn't even care that doesn't mean anything to him you know the only thing that matters to david is this longing my heart is longing i'm thirsting after you can you imagine that kind of a testimony in the middle of being deposed and ran out can can you imagine the catastrophic event that he's literally being chased out of jerusalem by his own son coming to kill him and he's not going out boohooing he's not going out guilty he's going out longing thirsting right in the middle of his trial the only thing he can think of is getting closer to god getting closer to god i'll tell you something friends if you want my advice on how to deal with this mad thing that we call life get closer to god we don't know we do not know what how all this is going to shake out the world right now is in such an unsettling time and you know i my advice to you if you've if you've been at at a distance with the lord be at distance no more amen move closer come to god you know it's not about if you've never known him in the cleansing of your sins then come to him that way don't try to bypass that don't try to take a shortcut don't end around don't run an end around play on calvary but if you've been to calvary and you know him in the power of his resurrection then every day of your life there should be a longing and a hungering as a deep calleth unto the deep if there's a deep calling that tells me there's a deep to respond or i couldn't have that kind of desire let's stand oh thank you lord thank you jesus come brother brad bring your team again let's pray father i sure am glad you let me get to this sermon tonight lord and and i i did my best to try to express it lord even trying not to just even stay so close on my notes but just from my own heart my own experience lord i want to know you more deep inside my heart i want to know you oh i want to know you to feel your heart and know your mind father that's the great desire of our lives today now i pray a sermon like this lord jesus it it no doubt lord as as as it was in my heart it'll be in other people's heart you are anointing it to people's heart these are your children lord father i i'm glad that i don't have to get up in a pulpit and persuade people concerning the truths of your word these are already believers these people already believe you lord i i don't see a single face in this building lord that doesn't fully accept and believe for real believe that every word in the in your bible is true that every word in this message is true that every every every all the word of god is true and all the ways of god are just you know best you know the best above all and through all so father i'm asking today now that you will take this sermon lord and maybe it was a little chopped up i just was trying to speak it from the depths of my soul i i have this desire i am desiring what i was preaching tonight i want to know you more indeed in a deeper way i want to be like david i want to reach out to you in that hunger and that thirst for more of you granite master we commit it to you now and i commit all of the people into your hands here and in this building and those across the airwaves in the name of jesus our lord amen amen praise the lord what you want to sing brother brad boy that's a tough one [Music] there's a land beyond [Music] to leave this world that we know there is a king returning [Music] let's try it from the top we have the words now where there's a deep deep calling there's a d a d to respond there's a land there's a land beyond the sun where there's a year [Music] to leave this world that we've known [Music] us let me get these requests here um just making sure i don't miss any here i have a request of course we want to continue to pray for brother harrison and our brother just hanging on as far as i still know and believing that the lord has the whole matter in his hands you know there we were i was talking with sarah sunday and the family the whole family facing some really tough family decisions regarding that i don't want to elaborate too much but how many will just pray for wisdom that's a tough spot to be in we were right there and having to answer some of those same questions when brother eddie was slipping away from us and we don't know brother harrison could be right back here by the weekend amen you know we're we're not supposed to limit the god of israel amen so i'm not ready to put him in a grave you know i'm going to pray for his healing until he's crossed till he's crossed over because when he crosses over he'll be healed anyway and so there's no losing you can't lose when you're the family of god but i don't want the brother to suffer enough the lord to be mindful to heal him then my goodness how we rejoice over that but either way brother harrison his future is bright amen so let's just ask the lord for his mercy in that situation sister princess her mom uh is in the hospital cove at 19. and it's been a
