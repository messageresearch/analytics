[30:46] well i better not forget that let me i
[30:48] just add that right quick
[30:51] got a call today from brother richard
[30:55] and it's the first time that brother
[30:58] richard has just told me
[31:00] in his own words matter of fact
[31:04] he wants to come home amen he wants to
[31:06] come home to beaufort that's what he
[31:08] said
[31:08] and so um i told him if he ever wanted

[31:12] him amen so
[31:14] you pray sister rosa has been praying a
[31:16] man like crazy for this hour and we've
[31:19] there's been times where he suggested he
[31:21] would and then when i call him and talk
[31:23] to him it seems like he's not sure
[31:25] but this time he was very very certain
[31:28] so we want to just pray that the lord
[31:31] make a way for
[31:32] that i haven't been able to reach his
[31:34] family just yet
[31:35] so don't know what kind of reaction
[31:37] they're going to give us but hey can we
[31:38] put it on the prayer list tonight
[31:40] amen to disbelieve that brother richard
[31:41] he wants to be back here among us
[31:44] so we're just going to believe and the
[31:45] lord will bless that amen
[31:48] all right second corinthians
[31:51] chapter four i want to
[31:54] uh you may have gotten the notice i sent
[31:56] out to just let you know we want to
[31:58] continue
[31:59] with striving against corruption within
[32:01] this will be part two we're continuing
[32:03] from sunday
[32:05] second corinthians chapter 4 and
[32:09] want to begin right at verse 1.
[32:12] second corinthians 4 and 1.
[32:17] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[32:20] as we have received mercy we faint not
[32:24] but have renounced to the hidden things
[32:26] of dishonesty
[32:28] not walking in craftiness nor handling
[32:30] the word of god deceitfully
[32:33] but by manifestation of the truth
[32:35] commending ourselves
[32:37] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[32:39] the sight of god
[32:41] but if our gospel be hid it is hid to
[32:44] them that are lost
[32:46] in whom the god of this world hath
[32:49] blinded the minds of them that believe
[32:52] not
[32:52] lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[32:55] christ
[32:56] who is the image of god should shine
[32:58] unto them
[33:00] for we preach not ourselves but christ
[33:03] jesus the lord
[33:04] and ourselves your servants for jesus
[33:07] sake
[33:08] for god who commanded the light to shine
[33:10] out of darkness
[33:12] hath shined in our hearts to give the
[33:14] light of the knowledge
[33:16] of the glory of god in the face of jesus
[33:18] christ
[33:19] but we have this treasure in earthen
[33:22] vessels
[33:23] that the excellency of the power may be
[33:26] of god and not of us
[33:28] we are troubled on every side yet not
[33:31] distressed
[33:32] we are perplexed but not in despair
[33:35] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[33:39] but not destroyed always bearing about
[33:42] in the body the dying of the lord jesus
[33:45] that the life also of jesus might be
[33:48] made manifest in our body
[33:50] for we which live are always delivered
[33:52] unto death for jesus sake
[33:55] that the life also of jesus might be
[33:57] made manifest
[33:58] in our mortal flesh in our mortal flesh
[34:01] isn't that wonderful
[34:03] so it's not just i'm i think i'm a
[34:04] christian i live like one
[34:06] amen and let's go a few chapters over to
[34:09] chapter seven second corinthians chapter
[34:11] seven
[34:12] and uh and we'll catch two verses here
[34:16] second corinthians seven verse five
[34:22] for when we were come into macedonia our
[34:24] flesh had no rest
[34:26] but we were troubled on every side
[34:29] without
[34:30] were fightings with let me start again
[34:34] for when we were come into macedonia our
[34:37] flesh had no rest
[34:39] but we were troubled on every side
[34:41] without where fightings
[34:43] within were fears nevertheless
[34:46] god that comforteth those that are cast
[34:49] down comforted us by the coming of titus
[34:52] and not by his coming only but by the
[34:55] consolation wherewith he was comforted
[34:57] in you
[34:58] when he told us your earnest desire your
[35:02] mourning your fervent mind toward me so
[35:05] that i rejoice
[35:06] the more let's pray father we thank you
[35:10] for your word
[35:12] i ask that you take over now lord and
[35:14] bring forth this thought
[35:16] that you have on my heart i give it
[35:18] completely into your hands
[35:20] in jesus name amen god bless your
[35:23] friends you can be seated
[35:37] you know paul
[35:40] drawing some conclusions that we want to
[35:43] look at
[35:44] this evening you know we're we're taking
[35:47] this subject striving against corruption
[35:49] within we started on that sunday
[35:51] because we had as you remember before
[35:53] that preached on
[35:55] striving against corruption and
[35:58] that was the corruption that we see in
[36:00] the world around us and
[36:02] you know we don't want to just uh ignore
[36:05] that even tonight there's madness on the
[36:07] streets and it's
[36:08] chaotic in the world that we live in it
[36:11] makes no sense
[36:12] the things that we see it proves that
[36:15] demon
[36:15] power is driving the agenda of mankind
[36:19] around the world
[36:20] because what we see defies logic it
[36:23] defies common sense and it defies
[36:26] everything and every standard i mean if
[36:28] you think about it
[36:29] there's there's there's really no moral
[36:33] or scruple
[36:34] or standard uh that that the world used
[36:37] to enjoy
[36:38] just 50 or 100 years ago that are in
[36:41] place
[36:42] still today every one of them have been
[36:45] upended
[36:46] uh the the the sacredness of marriage
[36:49] the sacredness of
[36:50] getting married if you're going to live
[36:52] together the sacredness of staying
[36:54] married and
[36:55] to to banish the idea of that it's
[36:58] anything less than death do us part
[37:01] the the nuclear family of a husband and
[37:04] a wife and
[37:05] you know how that children ought to be
[37:08] raised up in the fear of god and
[37:10] how that we ought to you know our lives
[37:13] ought to be a worship to the lord how we
[37:15] should attend church how we should have
[37:16] a testimony
[37:17] how we should be godly and escu evil and
[37:21] and the vices of the world of uh you
[37:24] know have always been thought of
[37:26] in those times as as as evil vices
[37:30] of alcohol and things like that and you
[37:32] know we we find that
[37:34] that the world has just completely
[37:36] flipped prayer in school is gone
[37:38] you know uh the the the very foundation
[37:41] that our nation was
[37:42] established on of christianity now
[37:45] nobody wants to
[37:46] try to assume anymore you know they they
[37:49] don't like the idea of anything to do
[37:52] with religion they want the government
[37:54] to be free of all religion yet this
[37:56] government
[37:57] was founded on the principles of the
[37:59] christian religion that's
[38:01] undeniable in history and so we realized
[38:04] friends that
[38:05] that that everything you know from the
[38:08] workplace
[38:09] to the uh schools of learning to homes
[38:12] and the families and children and
[38:15] and marriage and everything you know
[38:17] identity and gender identity and it used
[38:19] to be that how you were born is what you
[38:21] knew you were
[38:22] and and so today people people don't
[38:24] even
[38:25] they can't even figure out you know i i
[38:28] i know this that
[38:29] 23 chromosomes came from my mother and
[38:32] 23 came from my father
[38:34] and my mother i think uh delivered all
[38:36] the x and my dad delivered the why
[38:38] so i turned out to be a man and and had
[38:41] it been the other way around i'd have
[38:43] been a female but you know what
[38:44] i was born a man and i am a man and no
[38:47] amount
[38:48] of brainwashing or demon power can get
[38:51] me to think i'm not
[38:53] amen but that's literally the world
[38:56] that we live in today everything
[39:00] of value has been upended and reversed
[39:03] and it's not surprising to us when
[39:06] brother branham would say
[39:08] that paul's prophecy has been fulfilled
[39:11] in our day
[39:12] satan is now the god
[39:15] of this evil age
[39:20] jesus knew that the age would be evil he
[39:23] told us about it
[39:24] he warned us about it he warned that the
[39:27] days of noah would return
[39:28] they have the bible pro that when you
[39:32] look at the days of noah
[39:33] that they were married and given in
[39:35] marriage and and men of renown and
[39:38] you know or were doing these things and
[39:40] you know right before that you had sons
[39:42] of god looked upon the daughters of man
[39:44] took unto them wives
[39:45] intermingled god's uh family tree
[39:48] from coming from seth and and so we
[39:52] realized brother branham interpreted
[39:53] that to us that
[39:54] that the the sons of seth took unto them
[39:57] the daughters of cain
[39:59] and married them and began to
[40:00] intermingle uh
[40:02] the race like that and so you know it
[40:04] got to a point where the whole world in
[40:06] the days of noah
[40:08] and every man's mind was evil
[40:09] continually and
[40:11] jesus said that time will return at the
[40:14] end time and you'll know
[40:15] it's the end time when you see that he's
[40:18] talk talks about the days of lot
[40:20] when when uh um you know sodom was there
[40:24] and the um the uh the lb g
[40:27] q t z x y whatever they want to call it
[40:30] that was there that lived there that
[40:32] lives now that was prominent there
[40:34] that's prominent now
[40:36] that was accepted there you were
[40:38] criticized if you didn't
[40:40] and it's now here it's all the same well
[40:42] i'm here to tell you
[40:43] you know they can they can they cannot
[40:46] like it if they want
[40:47] but homosexuality is a mortal sin that
[40:50] you'll go to hell for it's contrary to
[40:53] the bible
[40:54] and it's contrary to the teachings from
[40:56] genesis to revelation it's a demon
[40:58] spirit
[40:58] amen that people have given over to
[41:02] and you know it's uh the word is still
[41:04] the word it doesn't matter that the age
[41:06] has become what it's become
[41:08] the word is still the word and therefore
[41:12] believers should still be believers sons
[41:15] of god
[41:15] today should look just like sons of god
[41:18] in in the first church
[41:20] sons of god today should act just like
[41:22] they did
[41:23] in the first church say well but the
[41:25] world is more evil yeah but the mighty
[41:27] god's unveiled
[41:28] amen we have a we have a more sure
[41:31] word of prophecy do you realize that
[41:34] when peter talks about in his day you go
[41:36] back 2000 years
[41:38] and peter making his statement the
[41:40] context of peter's statement when he
[41:42] said
[41:43] we have a more sure word of prophecy
[41:46] then that's the same as saying we now
[41:48] have the word of the prophets made more
[41:50] sure
[41:51] because we s we're in the day when it
[41:52] got fulfilled
[41:54] so back there when isaiah prophesied it
[41:57] the old testament saints believed it but
[42:00] to us it's a more sure word because
[42:02] we've lived it
[42:03] we saw it and so now you bring that
[42:06] context today
[42:07] i'm here to tell you the church knew
[42:09] what jesus prophesied
[42:11] but today we have a more sure word of
[42:13] prophecy
[42:14] because we're living in the day he said
[42:16] would be here when paul said perilous
[42:18] times
[42:19] we get it today we have a more sure word
[42:21] of prophecy
[42:23] he promised that he would reveal his
[42:25] word he promised that he would come
[42:26] with an open book today we have a more
[42:29] sure word of prophecy he promised that
[42:32] there would be a bride in the end time
[42:33] who would not be deceived we have a more
[42:36] sure word of prophecy
[42:40] amen you can bank your soul on
[42:44] that the word of god is the
[42:47] safety the place of safety where you can
[42:50] bank your soul
[42:52] the souls of everything and everyone you
[42:55] love
[42:56] don't worry put them on the word you
[42:58] won't go wrong
[42:59] you won't be left holding the bag you
[43:02] won't get the short end of the stick
[43:04] the bible says if you if trust the lord
[43:06] you won't be ashamed
[43:08] you're never going to blush you're never
[43:10] going to get embarrassed oh wow the lord
[43:12] failed me that's
[43:13] never going to happen amen
[43:19] so paul is saying you know i
[43:22] i live the right kind of life and
[43:26] i'm it's it's it's you know i commend
[43:28] myself to every man's conscience in the
[43:31] sight of god
[43:32] and so he's making the case that we have
[43:35] this ministry we've received it we faint
[43:37] not we renounce the hidden things of
[43:40] dishonesty
[43:41] and so he comes down to say so if the
[43:43] gospel
[43:45] is hid then it's hid watch it
[43:48] but if our gospel be hid it is hid to
[43:51] them that are lost
[43:53] see in other words it's not because
[43:57] i'm falling down on the job that they
[43:59] don't see it
[44:01] i am projecting the life of christ and
[44:04] if they don't see it
[44:05] it's because they're lost see
[44:08] so you say why does the world so
[44:12] disagree with this message
[44:13] because they're lost amen anytime you
[44:17] disagree with the truth of god's word
[44:19] it's because you're lost it doesn't mean
[44:21] you're a horrible person it means you're
[44:23] lost
[44:24] it means you need to be born again
[44:27] it means you need to surrender to the
[44:29] holy ghost and let him reveal himself to
[44:31] you
[44:32] because if you're going to make it to
[44:34] heaven you have to come god's provided
[44:36] way we have arrived at such a time
[44:40] at a junction of time where you know
[44:44] the the the church has had times where
[44:46] there were junctions
[44:47] and you know azusa revival was a a
[44:50] junction
[44:51] the opening of the seals is a junction
[44:54] when satan became the god of the evil
[44:57] age
[44:58] when the days of noah and lot had
[45:01] returned that was a junction
[45:03] i'm here to tell you something friends a
[45:04] prophet went away that was a junction
[45:07] because
[45:07] now the word is going to be hidden in
[45:09] these earthen vessels
[45:11] you understand so he talks about that
[45:14] so we have this treasure for god who
[45:17] commanded the light now this was god
[45:20] he commanded the light to shine out of
[45:21] darkness hath shined in our hearts to
[45:24] give the light of the knowledge of the
[45:25] glory of god
[45:26] in the face of jesus christ so he's
[45:28] saying look that same god that created
[45:30] heavens and earth hid himself
[45:32] in christ now that's wonderful but guess
[45:35] what that wasn't
[45:36] it that he wasn't finished because when
[45:39] he comes to the book of revelation
[45:41] it's now going to be his life in the
[45:43] church
[45:44] and so paul says now we have that same
[45:47] treasure what treasure the treasure that
[45:49] created the world
[45:50] the treasure that lived in jesus we have
[45:52] it in earth and vessels
[45:53] it's in me it's in you but remember
[45:56] the power that it's that the excellency
[45:59] of the power
[46:00] may be of god and not of us because you
[46:04] could not make you into the christian
[46:06] that you
[46:07] are it had to be god and i think every
[46:09] one of us would be honest enough to
[46:11] admit that
[46:15] and therefore when we go forward we're
[46:18] not surprised when we find ourselves
[46:21] oh you know bearing in our bodies the
[46:23] dying of the lord jesus we
[46:25] we shouldn't be surprised when we're
[46:27] troubled on every side and distressed
[46:29] see we're troubled on every side but not
[46:32] distressed in that amazing statement
[46:34] to be troubled on every side and not be
[46:37] distressed
[46:39] to be troubled on every side means
[46:40] you're surrounded
[46:43] it means you can't avoid the trouble you
[46:46] can't
[46:46] you can't parry or step left or right
[46:48] you'll run into trouble
[46:50] so you literally have to the christian
[46:52] has the ability when
[46:54] when the light of god's glory is hidden
[46:56] inside you
[46:57] you have the ability to stand in the
[47:00] center
[47:01] of honest of inescapable darkness and be
[47:04] a light
[47:06] and suffer no distress in other words it
[47:10] the the devil has no ability to shut you
[47:12] down
[47:16] so we're persecuted but we're not
[47:18] forsaken we are cast
[47:19] down we are yeah we are cast down it
[47:22] happens
[47:23] but we're not destroyed that
[47:27] that rankles the devil that he knocks
[47:30] you down
[47:31] and he don't end up destroying you and
[47:33] you know what you do you get back
[47:34] up and he comes and knocks you down
[47:37] again
[47:38] thinks he's got it turns to walk away
[47:40] and you're already getting back
[47:41] up dusting yourself off again i am cast
[47:45] down but i'm not destroyed
[47:47] well i'm gonna bring trouble on you fine
[47:50] surround me in it but it's not gonna
[47:52] distress me because i have a treasure
[47:54] hidden inside of me
[47:56] [Music]
[47:57] we've reached a junction of time friends
[47:59] that junction of time
[48:00] that we've reached is now the transition
[48:03] the last transition of our earthly
[48:05] bodies into a new realm
[48:08] and you know this is when we talk about
[48:11] divine healing let's just take that for
[48:13] an example
[48:15] do you realize that divine healing
[48:18] is part of the resurrection amen that
[48:22] that that what god does is he gives you
[48:24] when he heals your body
[48:26] you get a little temporary resurrection
[48:28] and he takes
[48:29] cells that are wrong and disease and
[48:32] affliction
[48:33] inside the blood or inside the body or
[48:35] inside some organ
[48:37] and he literally takes it and just fixes
[48:40] it
[48:41] now how did he do that the same power
[48:44] that's
[48:44] created the world it's creative power he
[48:47] just simply
[48:48] will take a diseased heart and say be
[48:51] whole and suddenly it's whole
[48:53] he'll take a cancer and say the lord
[48:56] rebuke thee and the life is gone and the
[48:57] cancer shrivels
[48:59] that is resurrection power that is a
[49:02] little dip
[49:03] of what will eventually not just heal an
[49:06] organ or heal your blood or heal your
[49:08] skin or heal your head
[49:09] it'll heal your whole body and change
[49:12] you
[49:13] into a glorified condition it'll
[49:15] literally
[49:16] change you at the molecular level and
[49:18] you will have a glorious body
[49:19] a glorified body like unto his glorious
[49:22] body
[49:23] so so god he always and this is an
[49:27] important point
[49:28] god always uses his word and so whether
[49:31] or not
[49:32] it's god delivering you of a physical
[49:34] affliction
[49:36] maybe your affliction's not physical
[49:38] maybe you've got some physical
[49:39] afflictions but they're brought on
[49:41] by things like stress and worry and
[49:43] mental anxiety and those things will
[49:45] give you physical situations
[49:48] they will cause physical conditions
[49:50] brother brown talks about worry
[49:52] he said don't worry because that will
[49:53] put i i don't fully understand this
[49:56] maybe dr meredith would understand a
[49:58] little better but he said don't worry
[50:00] because that'll put acid in your blood
[50:02] and give you arthritis
[50:05] so the inflammation somehow comes from
[50:07] that he talks about
[50:09] you know uh fear and worry and these
[50:12] kind of things
[50:13] they'll actually cause cancer so so the
[50:16] devil knows brotherhood says every
[50:18] disease
[50:18] is a fourth dimension disease when it
[50:22] starts out
[50:23] see so we live in three dimensions
[50:26] and satan is in that fifth dimension and
[50:29] the fourth dimension is the
[50:30] is the ethereal waves the we call them
[50:33] we'd say microwaves
[50:34] radio waves or signals like that but but
[50:37] it's that
[50:37] it's that ethereal realm that satan
[50:40] comes from
[50:41] that dimension of the of the lost into
[50:44] this dimension and afflicts your body
[50:46] and therefore you have a right to go to
[50:49] the lord and say
[50:50] i got a trespasser hanging on me and by
[50:53] your stripes that calvary
[50:54] i have the right to be healed and so you
[50:57] claim it and the devil has to go right
[50:59] back where he came from
[51:01] see and so whether god is delivering you
[51:05] of a physical disease
[51:07] or an emotional illness some mental
[51:10] illness
[51:11] some something like that that's in your
[51:12] spirit realm remember
[51:14] that your body is made up of ten senses
[51:16] you have ten inlet five inlets
[51:18] and five outlets you have your
[51:22] your sight and your smell and your your
[51:24] taste and your hearing and your touch
[51:26] but inside of that you have memory and
[51:28] conscience and reason and affection and
[51:30] imagination
[51:32] and those are all ten of them in a
[51:34] fallen state
[51:36] the only thing about you that's
[51:38] converted is your heart now
[51:40] the nature of the spirit is christ
[51:43] because a seed gene came to life and an
[51:45] old nature was annihilated
[51:47] so the greatest battle ever fought
[51:49] begins
[51:50] and now the inside of the inside that
[51:52] soul realm
[51:53] that word realm that god realm has got
[51:56] to begin to have dominion
[51:58] over the memories and over the
[52:00] conscience and over the affection
[52:02] and over the flesh and over what i see
[52:04] and look at and touch and taste and
[52:06] handle
[52:07] hallelujah and so we have this
[52:09] excellency
[52:10] in earth and vessels but it's supposed
[52:13] to live
[52:14] through us and conquer this fallen man
[52:18] bring him into put a thus
[52:21] listen friends the holy ghost gives you
[52:23] the ability
[52:24] to put the same chain on
[52:27] satan that the angel will take lucifer
[52:30] and with a chain and cast a memory in
[52:33] the book of revelation
[52:34] because it's not a physical chain it's a
[52:36] chain of circumstance that he don't have
[52:38] anybody to work through
[52:39] i i'd like to use that chain tonight i
[52:42] don't need to wait for a millennium
[52:44] and an angel to do it i'm a son of god
[52:46] and i'll take that same
[52:48] chain of circumstance and say you're not
[52:50] having any
[52:51] any rainy result in me oh boy i am
[52:54] dedicated
[52:54] to almighty god put him in a chain of
[52:59] circumstances
[53:00] in your life that he don't have no part
[53:02] of you that he can work through amen
[53:05] amen we're in that junction of time
[53:09] we're in that time of our departure
[53:11] friends we're in that time of the
[53:13] consummation of the gentile ages we're
[53:15] in that time when
[53:16] when when the next junction is going to
[53:18] be christ going to
[53:20] the 144 thousand and so the junction
[53:22] before that
[53:23] is to take a bride and a body change and
[53:25] i believe we are right upon it
[53:28] amen and if and if that's true and i
[53:31] believe it is
[53:32] then there you then then you need to
[53:34] wake up tonight and
[53:36] understand that you that that that it's
[53:39] not like
[53:39] we go from zero to a hundred we go from
[53:42] 99 to a hundred
[53:44] that same power that's going to change
[53:46] your body ought to be operating in your
[53:49] mind and your body and your life in your
[53:51] home
[53:52] right now we're not waiting on a revival
[53:56] the revival of the bride is here
[53:58] the word is open and you have full not
[54:01] partial
[54:01] full access to it
[54:05] amen and here's the beautiful thing it
[54:07] is you're inalienable right
[54:11] the archaic version is unalienable that
[54:13] jefferson used it inalienable
[54:15] unalienable means the same thing
[54:16] it means that that there it's a right
[54:19] that no one
[54:20] you don't have to wait for somebody to
[54:22] give it to you it is your inalienable
[54:24] right
[54:25] and no one can take it from you people
[54:28] can hinder you from
[54:30] exercising it but it doesn't change the
[54:32] fact that it is your inalienable right
[54:34] i have an inalienable right by the holy
[54:36] ghost to live a life
[54:38] above sin i have an inalienable right in
[54:42] the holy ghost to command the devil to
[54:44] leave me and he has to
[54:45] i have an inalienable right to lay hands
[54:47] on the sick and they shall recover i
[54:50] have an inalienable right
[54:51] to go to god and say we need your word
[54:54] and we have a right to
[54:55] expect that's why you you ought to be
[54:57] expecting god to speak to you in these
[54:59] services
[55:00] because he wants to do that he promised
[55:02] he would do that
[55:03] in a junction of time brother branham in
[55:07] speaking of one particular junction of
[55:09] time
[55:10] in january of 1956 quite a while ago
[55:16] this is a principle concerning junctions
[55:19] of time
[55:22] he says when all here's a principle
[55:25] during a junction when all hell turns
[55:28] loose
[55:30] all heaven turns loose also
[55:34] say it again when all hell turns loose
[55:37] because that's what happens in a
[55:38] junction
[55:40] it's it's satan these these biblical
[55:43] junctions
[55:44] at the end time are satan taking a
[55:46] bigger grip
[55:48] a tighter grip on the world taking a
[55:50] bigger bite you know wrapping more in
[55:52] and he's he's just grabbed more and
[55:54] grabbed more at every junction
[55:56] he grabs more until now he's got the
[55:58] whole world he's the god of the age
[56:00] he's completely turned upside down
[56:02] everything that we've ever thought was
[56:04] right and wrong and stood for
[56:05] amen but but you you don't want to be
[56:09] you are you are as the bible said
[56:12] troubled on every side
[56:14] but we're not distressed you know why
[56:16] because when he does that
[56:18] just know that when he does that heaven
[56:20] is also turning loose
[56:23] in other words when he says when all
[56:25] hell turns loose in other words when
[56:27] satan
[56:28] just goes all out understand when you
[56:32] feel like the devil is going all
[56:35] out to destroy you don't be troubled
[56:38] rejoice
[56:39] because heaven is going all out to save
[56:42] you
[56:44] and i'm here to tell you something
[56:45] friends god will never lose that fight
[56:48] if you will take your position in his
[56:51] word and say
[56:52] go ahead satan it's actually good news
[56:55] because i know if you're pulling out all
[56:57] the stops heaven's pulling out all the
[56:59] stops
[56:59] and i'm just gonna reach up into that
[57:01] atmosphere and pull it down around my
[57:03] life
[57:03] and you might surround me with trouble
[57:05] but i'm not distressed
[57:11] he says when the enemy comes in like a
[57:13] flood
[57:14] this is what happens in junctions
[57:17] because a junction is a fight for
[57:19] control
[57:20] amen god's not interested
[57:24] in stopping the trouble god's interested
[57:27] in coming into the trouble and
[57:29] preserving his family
[57:31] to show how great he is how is he ever
[57:34] going to show how great he is if you're
[57:35] never in trouble
[57:38] if you're never under attack how's he
[57:40] going to be your captain
[57:42] you understand if you're never under
[57:43] assault how's he if you're never in a
[57:46] time of confusion
[57:47] then why you know why would you need a
[57:48] banner
[57:50] why would you need god to raise a banner
[57:52] and wave a flag and say over here son
[57:53] here's the word come over here and stand
[57:55] you'll be fine
[57:56] oh i love it in times of trouble i've
[57:58] got direction
[57:59] i know where to go to find my help
[58:02] hallelujah said when he when the enemy
[58:04] comes in like a flood
[58:06] the spirit of god raises a standard
[58:09] against it
[58:11] now you know how brother branham
[58:12] interprets that verse
[58:14] that when the enemy comes in like a
[58:16] flood
[58:18] the spirit of god raises a standard
[58:20] against it he said
[58:21] that's you're the standard
[58:24] that god wants to raise and you
[58:28] raise yourself up in prayer
[58:31] and become the standard god needs
[58:34] god looks down and sees the enemy coming
[58:36] in
[58:37] and he knows the enemy's trying to undo
[58:39] his plan so he looks around and says
[58:41] i need some standards oh there's a
[58:43] church full in bethel tabernacle let me
[58:45] get them over here and put them in the
[58:46] way
[58:47] now say now let's see you get to my plan
[58:49] i got my family in your way
[58:51] and they've raised themselves up in
[58:53] prayer and you know what happens when
[58:55] when you do that you become an
[58:57] invincible army you become a standard
[59:00] that stops him
[59:01] he can't go over you can't go around you
[59:03] can't go under you
[59:04] because you are the living
[59:06] representation of god in the earth
[59:09] this is what the bible is teaching us
[59:11] and brother branham says now
[59:14] so when all hell turns loose all heaven
[59:17] turns loose
[59:18] also when the enemy comes in like a
[59:20] flood the spirit of god raises up a
[59:22] standard against it
[59:23] and these two forces is always
[59:27] showed at the junction
[59:30] these two forces god and the devil good
[59:33] and evil light and darkness
[59:35] satan with his family god with his
[59:37] family the word and the anti-word
[59:40] faith and doubt all of these opposites
[59:43] are there
[59:44] light and darkness good versus evil you
[59:47] get it
[59:48] and these two forces is always showed
[59:52] at the junction so when we talk about
[59:55] how that satan has
[59:58] filled the the whole world
[1:00:01] with sin and ungodliness by every
[1:00:05] possible tool
[1:00:06] every possible venue come on y'all live
[1:00:09] here with me
[1:00:10] you know that's true every possible
[1:00:13] outlet
[1:00:14] every possible way every natural way
[1:00:18] electronic way
[1:00:19] uh in a person-to-person interaction way
[1:00:23] on the job in the schools in the market
[1:00:26] in the neighborhood in your home in
[1:00:27] church trying to come to church
[1:00:29] i mean friends it's everywhere
[1:00:33] he he literally has covered the earth in
[1:00:36] sin
[1:00:36] and ungodliness you know he's
[1:00:40] filled the world oh that we live in with
[1:00:43] fear
[1:00:45] amen with stress with anxieties
[1:00:49] untold anxieties untold stress brother
[1:00:52] ram talks about that in the 1960s which
[1:00:54] was child's play compared to now
[1:00:57] how that he said you know you'd think in
[1:00:59] a nation like america
[1:01:01] with such excess and and everybody i
[1:01:04] mean we have everything we're first
[1:01:05] world country richest nation in the
[1:01:07] world
[1:01:08] enjoy the most freedoms we got
[1:01:10] everything at our fingertips anything
[1:01:11] you want you can pretty well get
[1:01:14] and he said you'd think in a world with
[1:01:16] such an amount of that
[1:01:17] that we would americans would just be
[1:01:20] able to sleep at night and be at peace
[1:01:22] and be happy and be
[1:01:24] be peaceful and he said but instead he
[1:01:26] said what are we doing
[1:01:28] he said we're having to take
[1:01:29] tranquilizers yes
[1:01:31] nerve pills he said the psychiatrists
[1:01:33] don't have the answer they prescribe
[1:01:35] nerve pills to each other
[1:01:37] back and forth psychiatrists go to other
[1:01:39] psychiatrists to get drugs
[1:01:41] that you know my mom and i were talking
[1:01:42] about it recently
[1:01:44] and and she was just making the comment
[1:01:46] she said you know i don't see how the
[1:01:48] world survives without this word
[1:01:50] i said mom the answer is they don't
[1:01:51] they're not that's why we have a drug
[1:01:53] epidemic that's why we have such chaos
[1:01:56] in the streets that's why we have
[1:01:57] anarchy
[1:01:58] that's why we have such people are just
[1:01:59] going crazy
[1:02:01] because the bottom line is they're not
[1:02:03] coping
[1:02:05] even with a drug epidemic even with
[1:02:08] alcoholism even with every
[1:02:10] every every way to satisfy the flesh
[1:02:13] is out there and the more man satisfies
[1:02:16] himself with the sinful things the more
[1:02:18] it poisons him
[1:02:20] the worse he becomes it's a vicious
[1:02:22] cycle there
[1:02:23] is no hope for this world i'm glad for
[1:02:27] christ who's coming to take me out of
[1:02:29] this world
[1:02:31] amen so whether it's
[1:02:35] mental anxieties fears pressures whether
[1:02:38] it's sensualities of the flesh
[1:02:40] and the bible talks about the pride of
[1:02:42] life the the lust of the flesh the lust
[1:02:45] of the eye
[1:02:47] things that can entice us things that
[1:02:50] bother us
[1:02:50] in our flesh and bother us in our mind
[1:02:53] and then
[1:02:54] satan as if he as if he's not low down
[1:02:56] enough you know like brother donnie he
[1:02:58] said one time said satan is the guy
[1:03:00] who will tempt you to rob the bank and
[1:03:03] while you're robbing it
[1:03:04] he'll call the cops on you
[1:03:12] but now i want you to think about
[1:03:13] something here for a minute
[1:03:15] because it's all a single enemy
[1:03:19] yes amen so what i mean by that is
[1:03:23] that satan is the same enemy
[1:03:27] in all instances he only changes his
[1:03:30] tactic
[1:03:31] depending on what he's trying to
[1:03:33] accomplish so
[1:03:34] by that in other words whether he's
[1:03:36] going to
[1:03:38] lure you into some pride of
[1:03:41] life lust of the eye lust of the flesh
[1:03:44] some sinful transgression and
[1:03:47] tempt you and get you to stumble in it
[1:03:49] whether it's that
[1:03:51] or whether it's a mental oppression or
[1:03:53] an anxiety
[1:03:55] or a stress on your mind understand
[1:03:58] this it's all the exact same devil
[1:04:01] he's just attacking different parts of
[1:04:04] you
[1:04:06] depending on what he's trying to do and
[1:04:08] so
[1:04:09] you realize then that that his
[1:04:12] his it's the same enemy using the same
[1:04:15] attack
[1:04:16] doing the same things just in different
[1:04:18] channels to get a different result
[1:04:20] and he begins the attack
[1:04:24] in either way whether it's your
[1:04:27] flesh or your mind he begins the with
[1:04:31] the same
[1:04:32] approach and he begins to attack the
[1:04:35] attack
[1:04:35] with a compromise in your mind yes
[1:04:39] amen against the word amen
[1:04:45] see a word is a thought
[1:04:48] expressed and that's why and then
[1:04:51] and then an action becomes a further
[1:04:53] expression of that
[1:04:55] so people when people end up committing
[1:04:58] a transgression it's because they
[1:05:00] thought about it
[1:05:01] that is that's something that you
[1:05:03] harbored and let fester
[1:05:05] until it led that's why the bible says
[1:05:07] that we are to bring every thought
[1:05:08] subject
[1:05:09] to the word of god because if you would
[1:05:11] bring a sinful thought
[1:05:13] subject to the word of god the holy
[1:05:15] ghost would kill it immediately
[1:05:16] and you'd go away you'd go away
[1:05:18] whistling victory
[1:05:19] but what we don't do a lot of times is
[1:05:23] the enemy puts a thought in our mind and
[1:05:25] a lot of times we're the one that
[1:05:27] that had the venue that he used to do it
[1:05:30] and
[1:05:30] and we're willing participants
[1:05:34] come on i ain't the only center in here
[1:05:36] surely amen
[1:05:40] sometimes we find ourselves willing
[1:05:42] participants and then we wonder
[1:05:43] you know why didn't the lord protect me
[1:05:45] well the lord tried every way in the
[1:05:46] world to get you to get that thing out
[1:05:48] of your life
[1:05:49] the lord warned you that would take you
[1:05:51] aside the lord warned you against that
[1:05:53] making that decision i don't know what
[1:05:56] what decisions we all face
[1:05:57] sometimes it's a job sometimes it's the
[1:05:59] wrong kind of friend
[1:06:00] sometimes it's an education sometimes
[1:06:03] it's a it's
[1:06:04] it's choosing what to recreate in it's
[1:06:06] choosing your entertainment
[1:06:07] these are choices you don't blame god
[1:06:09] and don't blame the devil
[1:06:11] brother branham uh uses he says speaking
[1:06:14] you know in the third person says you
[1:06:16] say
[1:06:16] oh brother branham the devil made me do
[1:06:18] it he said no he never
[1:06:20] he said how the devil get to you you're
[1:06:22] sealed into christ he can't get in there
[1:06:25] he said you walked out to him is what
[1:06:26] happened you stepped out and walked out
[1:06:29] to him and then you left yourself wide
[1:06:30] open that's what eve did she stepped out
[1:06:32] from behind the word
[1:06:33] right so he begins an attack with a
[1:06:36] compromise in your mind
[1:06:38] and you know something friends the the
[1:06:41] bible says the bride
[1:06:43] hath made herself ready i'm here to tell
[1:06:46] you you can
[1:06:47] you can blame god you can blame the
[1:06:50] devil you can ask god why
[1:06:51] let it happen but i'm here to tell you
[1:06:54] you have to be the officer
[1:06:57] god is looking to you to be the the
[1:07:00] treasure in an earthen vessel
[1:07:01] to say uh-uh devil uh-uh my mind ain't
[1:07:05] your garbage pile
[1:07:07] my life ain't designed for you i'm not
[1:07:09] interested in your ways
[1:07:11] i'm interested in the ways of the word
[1:07:13] i'm going to
[1:07:14] digest the word i'm going to feed on the
[1:07:16] word i'm going to live the word i'm
[1:07:17] going to
[1:07:18] make my body a living sacrifice for the
[1:07:21] word of god
[1:07:22] amen so you know we have to be the one
[1:07:26] to rise up and make ourselves
[1:07:28] ready that that the bride hath made
[1:07:30] herself ready to him that overcomes
[1:07:33] not to him who i overcame for him jesus
[1:07:36] did overcome the sin you couldn't
[1:07:38] overcome
[1:07:39] in other words he you couldn't get
[1:07:40] yourself back no matter how
[1:07:42] good you lived you'd have still went to
[1:07:44] hell you still could have never come in
[1:07:46] god's presence
[1:07:46] because you're born in sin that's the
[1:07:48] part you couldn't do so he did it for
[1:07:50] you
[1:07:51] he said well i i'm glad i got the holy
[1:07:53] ghost well fine you got the holiest now
[1:07:55] let me ask you the continuing question
[1:07:58] how much victory do you want in your
[1:07:59] life i'm not talking about have you had
[1:08:02] an experience and have you been born
[1:08:03] again
[1:08:03] i'm talking about the holy ghost feeds
[1:08:05] on the word of god and if you want to be
[1:08:07] an overcomer and you've got to decide
[1:08:09] you've got to either say i'm just happy
[1:08:11] to be a mediocre half lukewarm christian
[1:08:14] i'm here to tell you me and you aren't
[1:08:15] going to be very much friends because
[1:08:17] i'm not interested in that for my life
[1:08:19] i want to be fervent i want to be on
[1:08:21] fire i want to see the power
[1:08:24] and the authority of god's word moving
[1:08:26] in my life
[1:08:29] i'm not in this thing to be mediocre and
[1:08:32] half cold
[1:08:33] not in it that's not why he saved me
[1:08:35] that's not why he's revealed itself to
[1:08:37] me
[1:08:37] i want to i want to have all of jesus
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:44] it was his grace alone an election
[1:08:48] that allowed you to overcome the
[1:08:50] deception of the age you'd have been
[1:08:52] fooled just like everybody else don't
[1:08:54] don't pat yourself on the back with
[1:08:55] pride that i'm a smart person and i
[1:08:57] understand that
[1:08:58] the teachings of the word i understand
[1:09:00] all the mysteries that's why i couldn't
[1:09:01] be deceived
[1:09:02] a lot of times the more you understand
[1:09:04] the more easy satan can deceive you
[1:09:08] especially if you if it's nothing but
[1:09:10] but just a tool of pride
[1:09:12] and and it becomes arrogance and you
[1:09:14] become overconfident and think more
[1:09:16] highly of yourself than as you ought to
[1:09:19] and those are the kind that take the
[1:09:20] hardest falls i want to come and say
[1:09:22] lord nothing in my arms i bring
[1:09:24] simply to thy cross i cling hallelujah
[1:09:27] my only worth my only value is in you
[1:09:30] lord
[1:09:31] hallelujah can you say that to the lord
[1:09:33] my only worth lord is in you
[1:09:35] my only value i my life has no value i
[1:09:37] have no intrinsic purpose
[1:09:39] if i'm a living evil as we learned last
[1:09:42] sunday and
[1:09:43] the service prior the world
[1:09:47] and its beauty had no intrinsic value
[1:09:49] without man to
[1:09:50] to admire it and human life has no
[1:09:53] purpose
[1:09:54] if it lives evilly that's why god was
[1:09:56] going to destroy it
[1:09:57] in chapter 6 of genesis
[1:10:01] so it is his grace alone in election
[1:10:04] that's how we overcome the deception of
[1:10:07] the
[1:10:07] age see but now
[1:10:12] to overcome in this junction to overcome
[1:10:16] all of these elements that we're talking
[1:10:18] about that have happened in this world
[1:10:19] that we've just spent time talking about
[1:10:21] and you all agreed they're here to
[1:10:24] overcome
[1:10:24] in this evil age i'm here to tell you
[1:10:27] first of all
[1:10:28] without the holy ghost it's impossible
[1:10:31] and without this message you would never
[1:10:33] get the holy ghost because the the
[1:10:35] message of the hour
[1:10:36] is not a man if it was a man-made theory
[1:10:38] then it would never give you the holy
[1:10:39] ghost
[1:10:40] it would just fill you up with with
[1:10:42] theology and you could do that by going
[1:10:44] to a seminary
[1:10:45] see and it because correct teaching
[1:10:48] isn't isn't
[1:10:49] isn't how that that you get the holy
[1:10:52] ghost
[1:10:53] it's your saying amen to every word
[1:10:56] it's your complete heart sold out to the
[1:10:58] word of the hour
[1:11:00] and then god comes down and looks in
[1:11:01] that heart and sees you mean business
[1:11:03] and you're done with the world and you
[1:11:05] want him you don't you don't want to
[1:11:07] know about him you want to know
[1:11:09] him you know it doesn't matter if you
[1:11:11] can't even read the book
[1:11:13] do you know the author of the book
[1:11:17] that is the important all-important
[1:11:20] element
[1:11:22] god helps us to overcome the deception
[1:11:24] but to overcome
[1:11:26] all the things in this modern world
[1:11:29] that are contrary to the word and
[1:11:31] there's a lot of them
[1:11:34] we have a part to play in that
[1:11:38] brother branham deals with that and how
[1:11:39] can i overcome and various other
[1:11:41] messages
[1:11:42] that he says overcoming isn't god
[1:11:45] you know pushing you through a pipe and
[1:11:47] pulling you out the other side in other
[1:11:49] words like
[1:11:50] think of like a mold like you see people
[1:11:52] with a mold and it's open and they pour
[1:11:54] hot liquid in there and close the mold
[1:11:56] and when it cools it solidifies
[1:11:57] they open the mold and it's in the shape
[1:11:59] of the mold that's that's the point he's
[1:12:01] making
[1:12:02] it's not god taking you and he needs you
[1:12:04] to look like a pipe
[1:12:06] you know with perfectly round rounded
[1:12:08] and this long and this diameter
[1:12:10] and so he just crammed you and shoves
[1:12:12] you into this molder
[1:12:16] and then pulls you out out the other
[1:12:18] side oh look at this perfect overcomer
[1:12:21] what a beautiful christian and he said
[1:12:23] you didn't overcome anything
[1:12:25] you didn't overcome anything all he did
[1:12:27] was shove you in
[1:12:28] and pull you out and brother luther
[1:12:32] luther getting a kick out of my examples
[1:12:35] amen but i
[1:12:36] you know when brother branham starts
[1:12:37] telling these stories i visualize these
[1:12:38] things
[1:12:39] and so i don't want to be that i i want
[1:12:41] to be that
[1:12:42] that i looked at the blueprint and that
[1:12:45] i said
[1:12:46] okay if i want to be this then i need to
[1:12:48] make this change in my life

[1:13:08] something that doesn't pull me into the
[1:13:09] world

[1:13:14] man or
[1:13:14] beautiful young woman but you're not a
[1:13:16] christian and i

[1:13:20] there's no future
[1:13:21] for you and i because i'm only going to
[1:13:25] join myself
[1:13:26] to the word if you're a young girl
[1:13:29] you're going to want a word man and if
[1:13:30] you're a young man you're going to want
[1:13:32] a word woman trust me
[1:13:33] you're going to want a word person
[1:13:36] hallelujah the worst mistake you will
[1:13:40] ever make in your life is to choose a
[1:13:42] non-word person
[1:13:43] to be your companion in life
[1:13:48] so we have to overcome when you want to
[1:13:51] overcome the mental anxieties and the
[1:13:53] fears and the anxieties
[1:13:55] you got to do it god provides you the
[1:13:57] way he
[1:13:58] he not only gives you the blueprint and
[1:14:01] the instruction manual
[1:14:02] but if you'll believe it put it on your
[1:14:04] lips and start speaking it
[1:14:05] then an anointing will come down from
[1:14:07] heaven and start
[1:14:09] anointing that word that you're putting
[1:14:11] in your heart and you know what'll
[1:14:12] happen magic
[1:14:14] suddenly your anxiety will leave and
[1:14:16] your fears will go and your body will be
[1:14:18] healed
[1:14:19] that's exactly how it works but you've
[1:14:22] got to do it you've got to decide
[1:14:25] that say i will
[1:14:28] take the way with the lord's despised
[1:14:30] view i will choose to believe his word i
[1:14:33] will choose to confess it
[1:14:34] i will only let my mind confess what his
[1:14:37] word
[1:14:38] says whatever i see in in circumstances
[1:14:42] or symptoms has nothing to do with his
[1:14:44] word
[1:14:45] his word doesn't recognize it his word
[1:14:47] only recognizes what he accomplished at
[1:14:49] calvary
[1:14:49] what the holy ghost is given for and all
[1:14:52] you have to do is plug in as a believer
[1:14:54] and
[1:14:54] and it will begin to flow through you
[1:14:56] amen
[1:14:58] brother branham says he says concerning
[1:15:01] this junctions of time where we have
[1:15:03] such evil days i'm trying to hurry
[1:15:06] says today we need divine healing worse
[1:15:09] than we ever needed it
[1:15:10] and as the days go on and on and they
[1:15:13] have
[1:15:14] and on and on and they have
[1:15:17] so will it be more needed
[1:15:20] what divine healing i'm here today
[1:15:22] something friends
[1:15:23] we've got things brother branham
[1:15:25] prophesied about it way back in the
[1:15:27] early days and said there's coming
[1:15:28] diseases on the earth
[1:15:30] that'll make cancer like a toothache
[1:15:32] amen
[1:15:33] now here we are in a global pandemic and
[1:15:35] everybody running in fear
[1:15:36] and we're being prudent and we're being
[1:15:38] wise because we got enough common sense
[1:15:40] to be
[1:15:41] any christian is prudent any a christian
[1:15:44] is not a christian is not
[1:15:46] you know reckless in the sense of you
[1:15:49] know just
[1:15:49] throwing god expects you to exercise the
[1:15:52] wisdom
[1:15:54] of the holy ghost you understand so
[1:15:57] you know brother branham's ability to
[1:16:00] put that bull
[1:16:01] to sleep when when he's ready to kill
[1:16:04] him
[1:16:05] is because brother branham happened into
[1:16:07] that by accident he didn't go out there
[1:16:09] to challenge that boy
[1:16:11] brother branham talks about a sickness
[1:16:13] and he says
[1:16:14] he says now he says don't jump up there
[1:16:18] and try to say satan i rebuke your
[1:16:20] arabic i repeat arabic
[1:16:21] he said that's like kicking out a
[1:16:23] rattlesnake
[1:16:25] he said you don't kick at him he will
[1:16:26] bite you he said you know how you what
[1:16:29] do you do when you come up on a snake
[1:16:31] turn around walk away don't got a kick
[1:16:34] at him
[1:16:35] he can't hurt me he can only hurt me if
[1:16:37] i kick at him
[1:16:38] see and and so i mean you know if i
[1:16:42] if i need to back up and get a rock and
[1:16:43] bash his brains in but in other words
[1:16:45] he's no threat to me so i just turn
[1:16:48] around and walk away and go the other
[1:16:49] direction
[1:16:52] and we're we're facing things in this
[1:16:54] life now listen friends
[1:16:56] we should not be we do use prudence and
[1:17:00] wisdom but
[1:17:01] we're not to operate in fear you're not
[1:17:04] given the spirit of fear
[1:17:05] i'm not afraid of cove but i'm not
[1:17:07] afraid of cancer i'm not afraid of
[1:17:09] anything say
[1:17:09] you might get sick tomorrow i might but
[1:17:11] i'm not afraid of it
[1:17:13] i'm not afraid that i might and if i do
[1:17:15] i'm not going to be afraid of it then
[1:17:17] let me tell you something friend you
[1:17:18] can't threaten a man who ain't afraid to
[1:17:20] die
[1:17:21] a man satan can't threaten me with death
[1:17:24] for to me to live is christ and to die
[1:17:26] is gain
[1:17:27] fine but while i'm here i'm gonna serve
[1:17:30] the lord
[1:17:31] and i'm gonna take down the kingdom of
[1:17:33] the devil every chance i get
[1:17:35] i'm not here to compromise i'm offering
[1:17:37] him no quarter
[1:17:38] no truce no treaty i'm here to blow him
[1:17:41] up with the word of god at every chance
[1:17:43] i can
[1:17:45] he's going to take his shots on you even
[1:17:48] if you
[1:17:48] don't never touch him he'll still beat
[1:17:50] you in the head why don't you pick up
[1:17:52] the word of god
[1:17:53] and take a sword and cut that guy down
[1:17:57] come on friends we're the bride of
[1:17:59] christ we're at a junction
[1:18:00] time and god needs warriors and
[1:18:03] champions who aren't afraid to draw
[1:18:04] their sword
[1:18:05] and say it's thus saith the lord bring
[1:18:08] it as a badge of courage brother branham
[1:18:10] says
[1:18:11] apply the token with confidence
[1:18:15] talks about that policeman you know
[1:18:18] two-bit cop
[1:18:19] wouldn't hardly couldn't fight his way
[1:18:20] out of a wet paper bag
[1:18:22] not big enough to stop a bicycle much
[1:18:24] less a 400 horsepower
[1:18:26] car and he said but but he's got a big
[1:18:28] old badge
[1:18:29] almost as big as he is and he got a
[1:18:31] whistle said well let him walk out there
[1:18:33] in the street with that badge
[1:18:34] blow the whistle throw up the hand he
[1:18:36] said cars hit the brakes
[1:18:38] why he can't stop him but he's got a
[1:18:41] badge of authority
[1:18:42] that's your holy ghost birth it's a
[1:18:45] badge of authority to show the devil
[1:18:47] who you are say he knows who i am it's
[1:18:49] not about your identity who you
[1:18:51] are it's about who you are in him
[1:18:54] hallelujah
[1:18:55] it's that i am the body of the lord
[1:18:57] jesus christ
[1:18:59] so brother branham says watch this now
[1:19:02] we
[1:19:02] we're going to need it more and more
[1:19:04] it'll come to pass after a while this is
[1:19:06] a prophecy
[1:19:08] it'll come to pass after a while
[1:19:12] that unless a man is sealed in the holy
[1:19:14] ghost
[1:19:15] he says it's hard to tell he's laid
[1:19:18] itself open to all kinds of things
[1:19:21] see so the promise is come not nigh
[1:19:25] any of those who has the seal of god in
[1:19:27] their forehead
[1:19:28] see when them tremendous plagues begin
[1:19:30] to fall
[1:19:31] he said we're at the junction we're at
[1:19:34] the crossroads now that's 50 years ago
[1:19:36] more than well over 50 years ago
[1:19:40] nearly 70 years ago and here we are
[1:19:44] friends we're at that junction to where
[1:19:46] these prophecies are coming to pass
[1:19:48] this is a time to be fearless now you
[1:19:50] can't be fearless on your own i'm not
[1:19:51] talking about bravado and gusto and
[1:19:53] machismo
[1:19:54] i'm talking about faith in the word of
[1:19:56] god
[1:19:57] it doesn't matter it's not about muscles
[1:19:59] it's about faith
[1:20:01] see and so so we realized then that
[1:20:06] that we're at an age that without the
[1:20:08] holy ghost because of why
[1:20:10] he says because he's laid his self open
[1:20:13] to all kinds of things
[1:20:14] mankind has opened his mind to such a
[1:20:17] degree
[1:20:18] that he's allowed the poisons of satan
[1:20:20] to so take over the world
[1:20:23] that the 21st century the late great
[1:20:25] planet earth in the 21st century
[1:20:27] is nearing a complete global collapse of
[1:20:30] humanity amen
[1:20:32] that's how serious this is
[1:20:35] a complete we're talking about an
[1:20:37] extinction event friends
[1:20:40] that mankind is facing a soon-coming
[1:20:43] extinction event of his own making
[1:20:46] because why he's opened himself up
[1:20:49] he's been doing it since this age and
[1:20:51] even before this age and that's
[1:20:54] that it should explain to you the
[1:20:56] madness that you see today
[1:20:58] and once you understand what it's all
[1:21:00] about that should inform your thinking
[1:21:02] as to how you conduct yourself
[1:21:04] that should inform your thinking about
[1:21:05] how you approach the word of god
[1:21:07] how you approach church how you approach
[1:21:09] fellowship how you approach prayer
[1:21:10] your your consideration of partaking of
[1:21:13] the word of god if you're only coming
[1:21:15] to this building you know every other
[1:21:17] week twice a week every other week
[1:21:19] and you don't have any intake of the
[1:21:21] word when it comes to monday and tuesday
[1:21:24] and thursday and friday and saturday
[1:21:25] of not every other week but every every
[1:21:27] week every day of every week
[1:21:29] i'm here to tell you you can't live like
[1:21:31] that back then you could have not now
[1:21:35] we're in the final junction
[1:21:40] he says those who
[1:21:43] they laugh and make fun of today
[1:21:47] because you desire to live a full
[1:21:49] surrendered life to the lord jesus i
[1:21:51] think that's such a beautiful statement
[1:21:53] they don't realize that you're tucked
[1:21:54] away under his everlasting arms
[1:21:56] that's what the world can't get they
[1:21:58] can't get you
[1:22:01] the devil can't get you how is it i
[1:22:03] torment you
[1:22:04] and you still wear a smile how is it
[1:22:06] that i make you sick and you still trust
[1:22:08] the lord
[1:22:08] how is it that i call you in affliction
[1:22:10] and you still are a wonderful christian
[1:22:13] i can't get you to leave christ i can't
[1:22:15] get you to deny the word
[1:22:16] what is wrong with you people
[1:22:20] find many people who who can't
[1:22:22] understand
[1:22:23] why i am so happy and free i've crossed
[1:22:26] over jordan to canaan's fair land
[1:22:28] and that's what's the matter with me
[1:22:32] that's the way brother branham sung it
[1:22:35] amen so he says they don't understand
[1:22:39] we're tucked away under these
[1:22:40] everlasting arms
[1:22:42] he starts talking about how moses down
[1:22:44] in egypt he took his stick and
[1:22:46] he cast it down you remember that and
[1:22:48] then janice and jamery's come on the
[1:22:49] scene and
[1:22:50] every time the miraculous was done satan
[1:22:53] is always there to counterfeit it
[1:22:55] and you know i think if any word
[1:22:58] would almost completely epitomize this
[1:23:00] day and hour that we live in is the word
[1:23:02] counterfeit
[1:23:04] everything is a counterfeit nobody you
[1:23:06] don't get the real version of anybody
[1:23:09] everybody's got on a veneer everybody's
[1:23:10] got on the front everybody
[1:23:12] you know everybody's out to really get
[1:23:14] everybody but everybody smiles at
[1:23:15] everybody
[1:23:17] and all you've got to do is turn your
[1:23:19] back and if they can lift themselves up
[1:23:21] by stepping on you get ready for it get
[1:23:23] your head crushed
[1:23:24] because that's the world we live in it
[1:23:26] is dog-eat-dog
[1:23:28] i'm glad i'm not part of this world i'm
[1:23:31] glad friends that i can turn my back on
[1:23:33] you and know that if an enemy comes up
[1:23:35] behind me you'll whack him for me
[1:23:37] hallelujah i'm glad i got the family of
[1:23:40] god i'm glad that
[1:23:41] you're not trying to trick me or i'm not
[1:23:43] trying to trick you i'm glad that if i
[1:23:45] ask you a question you'll tell me the
[1:23:46] truth i'm glad
[1:23:48] that when i'm down you'll lift me up i'm
[1:23:50] glad if i'm sick you'll pray
[1:23:52] and you mean it when you pray
[1:23:55] amen i'm glad to be in the last bastion
[1:23:58] of where it's
[1:23:59] won all for one and one for all because
[1:24:01] that's gone from the world friend
[1:24:05] every time and i love this now even his
[1:24:07] counterfeits what a statement
[1:24:09] even his counterfeits only point to the
[1:24:12] end time
[1:24:12] at the junction so all of the
[1:24:14] counterfeit
[1:24:16] facade of humanity that you see
[1:24:19] and all of hollywood pretending like
[1:24:21] they're happy
[1:24:23] amen and but they find them hanging
[1:24:25] their selves in their closets and they
[1:24:27] find them oding on drugs
[1:24:29] and they find them divorced and married
[1:24:30] and divorced five and six and seven
[1:24:32] times
[1:24:32] and they find them shooting their brains
[1:24:34] out you know what
[1:24:35] all of that glitzy look like i'm happy
[1:24:38] red carpet smiles
[1:24:39] when what you don't see is the torment
[1:24:42] that they have see
[1:24:44] amen men with men literally literally
[1:24:48] men who had 50 million dollars
[1:24:52] and lost every bit of it down to a
[1:24:54] million dollars
[1:24:55] and they jumped out of a 50-story window
[1:24:57] because they said i'm down to just a
[1:24:59] million dollars
[1:25:01] and they killed themselves that's
[1:25:03] history they've done that
[1:25:05] because the the loss of 49 million is so
[1:25:07] overwhelming and they don't even think
[1:25:09] well god
[1:25:09] goodness i've got gallet a million
[1:25:12] dollars
[1:25:13] and people jump out of windows with a
[1:25:15] million dollars in the bank
[1:25:17] this is the crazy world that we live in
[1:25:20] it happens
[1:25:21] all the time amen
[1:25:24] he says believers rest in him let the
[1:25:27] judgment sweep just like in noah's ark
[1:25:29] let the judgment
[1:25:30] sweep what difference does that make
[1:25:33] wouldn't you love
[1:25:34] how many tonight would like to say

[1:25:38] i i my name is jason watkins and i
[1:25:42] endorse uh this message what message is
[1:25:46] it
[1:25:46] believers rest in him uh like noah and
[1:25:50] the ark let the judgment sweep what
[1:25:52] difference does it make even death
[1:25:55] itself has no
[1:25:56] barriers no pains old death come on
[1:25:59] death where's thy sting
[1:26:00] grave where's your victory never scares
[1:26:03] me to pass a graveyard
[1:26:04] i can shout and praise god for i know
[1:26:07] and be alive in him forevermore
[1:26:10] what does a graveyard matter to me what
[1:26:12] is a death sentence why do i care
[1:26:14] and no one can kill me until he's done
[1:26:16] with me until god is finished with you
[1:26:19] you are immortal you can't die you can't
[1:26:21] be killed
[1:26:22] you can't be stopped hallelujah
[1:26:26] this is the heritage of being in god's
[1:26:29] family
[1:26:31] he said omnipotence has spoke spoke to
[1:26:34] my heart as it spoke to your heart
[1:26:35] friends it spoke to my heart the
[1:26:38] miraculous was done
[1:26:40] now watch him start talking about the
[1:26:42] miraculous i'm going to wind down here
[1:26:44] once a little cowardly sinner maybe
[1:26:48] maybe like you did he said a drunkard or
[1:26:51] a cigarette smoker or a runner to dances
[1:26:53] and
[1:26:53] carrying on like that say william
[1:26:56] branham
[1:26:58] how'd you get out of that omnipotent
[1:27:00] spoke
[1:27:02] he said i received it you received it
[1:27:04] and the miraculous
[1:27:06] was done amen you changed from death and
[1:27:10] to life
[1:27:11] and forsaken your sins what did it
[1:27:14] omnipotence
[1:27:15] spoke and the miraculous was done
[1:27:18] amen you ever run into
[1:27:21] people who knew you when you were sinner
[1:27:23] and they say man what in the world
[1:27:24] happened to you say
[1:27:25] just just say that omnipotence spoke and
[1:27:28] the miraculous was done
[1:27:30] how are you still a christian
[1:27:31] omnipotence spoke and the miraculous is
[1:27:34] done
[1:27:34] i thought you had cancer and was dying
[1:27:36] yeah but omnipotent smoke
[1:27:38] i spoke and and and and and the
[1:27:40] miraculous was done
[1:27:42] right i thought that you know you were
[1:27:44] they they said you were depressed and we
[1:27:46] thought you were going to commit suicide
[1:27:47] what happened to you
[1:27:49] the omnipotence spoke the miraculous was
[1:27:52] done
[1:27:53] now brother sister what's taking place
[1:27:56] now
[1:27:57] we're at the end time
[1:28:02] we are going into the millennium
[1:28:05] every hand pointing that way
[1:28:10] you know when i read that and i thought
[1:28:12] about brother branham making this
[1:28:14] statement here in 1956
[1:28:16] we're at the end time now i could say to
[1:28:19] you tonight friends we are really at the
[1:28:21] end time
[1:28:22] and we're going into the millennium and
[1:28:24] i could say
[1:28:26] every hand is pointing every sign is
[1:28:29] pointing to it
[1:28:30] and you you could legitimately say to me
[1:28:33] well brother jason brother brown was
[1:28:35] saying that in 1956
[1:28:37] see but you know you know
[1:28:40] so what why should i believe it now well
[1:28:43] here's something that i would point out
[1:28:44] to you
[1:28:44] i just thought about this today at the
[1:28:47] time in 1956
[1:28:50] you know there were still other things
[1:28:52] that gave
[1:28:53] mankind hope that it might still go the
[1:28:56] other way
[1:28:57] i mean in 1956 america was still under
[1:28:59] the blessing of god
[1:29:02] if they had accepted the message you
[1:29:04] wouldn't have what we have today
[1:29:06] you understand we have what we have
[1:29:08] today because they rejected it just like
[1:29:09] they always did as the lightning
[1:29:11] was coming from the east to the west
[1:29:12] every nation rejected it and every time
[1:29:14] they rejected it
[1:29:15] judgment was poured out upon them but
[1:29:17] during this time
[1:29:18] to you know to today today
[1:29:22] mankind has descended into complete
[1:29:25] darkness there's madness on men's minds
[1:29:29] it's on the streets everywhere
[1:29:30] all the exits are blocked amen
[1:29:34] there's no other way but the end of the
[1:29:36] world in 1956 there was still a chance
[1:29:39] that's gone
[1:29:40] that time has passed that ship has
[1:29:42] sailed it can't be turned around
[1:29:44] it can't be saved all the exits are
[1:29:47] blocked there's no way out now friends
[1:29:52] he says the the old clock is ticking
[1:29:55] away
[1:29:55] yes brother charles point of no return
[1:29:58] the old clock is ticking away about two
[1:30:02] minutes to midnight
[1:30:03] but watch what he says omnipotence is
[1:30:06] speaking
[1:30:07] see now there's another difference say
[1:30:10] but omnipotence was speaking in his day
[1:30:12] right but you know you know what
[1:30:13] omnipotence is speaking today a mature
[1:30:15] bride
[1:30:17] there wasn't even the last day word born
[1:30:20] bride wasn't even on the scene when he's
[1:30:22] saying this
[1:30:23] the last remnants of the of the azusa
[1:30:26] revivalist
[1:30:27] and 1956 they were about to cross the
[1:30:30] line and that would
[1:30:31] and god would be done with that with
[1:30:32] that pentecostal movement forever
[1:30:35] and he would go on uh to open the seven
[1:30:38] seals and a word-born bride
[1:30:40] would come on the scene and yet we
[1:30:42] didn't go in the rapture in the 1960s
[1:30:44] you know why because she's still an
[1:30:45] infant
[1:30:46] we couldn't see that then we see it now
[1:30:48] and what
[1:30:49] because he was never coming back to
[1:30:51] marry a little girl he was coming back
[1:30:52] to marry a queen
[1:30:54] so i'm here to tell you something
[1:30:55] friends what is a common denominator at
[1:30:58] a junction of time
[1:30:59] omnipotence speaks what's the difference
[1:31:01] between this omnipotence and that
[1:31:03] omnipotence
[1:31:04] they're the same omnipotence but we're
[1:31:06] at the last junction
[1:31:08] there's not another junction there's
[1:31:10] nothing else that can happen
[1:31:12] oh he says he says here here's another
[1:31:14] one angels are appearing
[1:31:17] amen angels are appearing you know i
[1:31:19] just i just was
[1:31:20] reading headlines now you'd think this
[1:31:23] would be in
[1:31:24] and you know what what do they call
[1:31:25] those magazines that you see on
[1:31:28] on the grocery store where they show you
[1:31:30] a picture and tell you a lie
[1:31:33] for your tabloids you know where they
[1:31:36] show you a picture and tell you a lie
[1:31:38] you'd think that it'd be something like
[1:31:40] that you've seen those kind of things
[1:31:41] for years but no now this is official
[1:31:43] government
[1:31:44] released footage this is official
[1:31:46] government
[1:31:47] recognized this is headlines where the
[1:31:50] government is finally now acknowledging
[1:31:52] look friends no more mystery to it we
[1:31:55] have
[1:31:56] unidentified flying objects that we
[1:31:59] cannot
[1:32:00] we don't know where they come from but
[1:32:02] we can what we can tell and i just saw
[1:32:04] this headline recently
[1:32:06] one of the clarifying remarks they made
[1:32:08] is is that what one thing that we can
[1:32:10] see
[1:32:11] is that they're made out of off-world
[1:32:13] material
[1:32:15] and that was their word said we can see
[1:32:18] that the material
[1:32:19] that these aircraft are made of was
[1:32:21] clearly made off world
[1:32:22] and we don't understand that because
[1:32:24] nobody's off world making stuff
[1:32:29] angels appearing brother branham said
[1:32:32] the world looks at them they think
[1:32:33] they're flying saucers in 1960s the
[1:32:35] government tried to hide it they're not
[1:32:36] hiding it anymore
[1:32:37] they can't hide it it's it's 21st
[1:32:39] century too many people got cell phone
[1:32:41] cameras
[1:32:42] there's too much evidence they got high
[1:32:44] ranking officials and army people and
[1:32:46] people flying jets flew right up to
[1:32:47] these things
[1:32:48] this is recent this is recent
[1:32:51] listen friends brother branham said
[1:32:53] those are investigating they're not
[1:32:55] space men they're investigating angels
[1:32:58] that's why they can suddenly be there
[1:33:00] and a supersonic jet
[1:33:02] wide open trying to stay with them and
[1:33:03] all of a sudden they're gone
[1:33:06] and they said we've never seen anything
[1:33:08] that could i read
[1:33:09] i read the testimony of one air force
[1:33:11] colonel was chasing it down
[1:33:12] in an f22 raptor and they they said
[1:33:15] what can you tell us what was it he said

[1:43:26] i was expecting to hear but ain't what i
[1:43:28] heard
[1:43:29] and he says now i want to talk to the
[1:43:32] devil
[1:43:35] and buddy i was saying man i wouldn't
[1:43:38] want to be the devil right now
[1:43:40] i mean you talk about somebody who took
[1:43:42] a beat down
[1:43:43] he let the devil know who was in charge
[1:43:46] and who wasn't in charge
[1:43:48] and he didn't pull no punches in telling
[1:43:50] the devil where to get
[1:43:52] off and to take his hands off of god's
[1:43:54] property he said
[1:43:55] i satan i happen to know this lady
[1:43:58] sister debbie
[1:43:59] and i happen to know her to be a
[1:44:01] daughter of god

[1:44:04] trespasser
[1:44:05] and you will take your hands off of
