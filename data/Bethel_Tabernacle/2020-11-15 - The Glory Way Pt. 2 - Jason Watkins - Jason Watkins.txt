listening in they're always asking me to comment or actually lead it and so for a long time we've been hearing a certain brother just talking all we had was a voice and we would sometimes right now we're going through the whole book of revelation but before we were we would take like read a portion out of a out of a message book and then various men would comment on it and and brother esteban

speed and the front part of the drive axle the drive shaft drops to the ground now if you if the back falls you just drag it you're stranded but if the front drops it's going like that and if it hits a hole or a divot or something it's going to cat shot that truck into oblivion and brother jack with it and so that thing broke down and brother jack got her off the road and was safe amen see that smile sister kathy has oh my goodness goodness but but the shaft came down out on the highway oh so you just made it in and got stopped wow brother eddie had something like that happen to him my dad where he was we were driving through through loveland pass headed to utah and i mean i'm looking out my window and it's the chasm below is there's no guardrail and we kept we kept hearing every time

origin and so we're happy um happy to have him here and so we want to have you stand back up and we're going to go into the scriptures amen i believe that the lord has something for us we're going to look first at romans chapter 9 and we'll catch romans 9 and then we'll quickly catch hebrews 2. i want to be praying for brother matt and ethan and brother anthony and micah and brother travis and mason amen so anytime you take mason on a trip you need prayer so and so amen sister deborah saying amen so that's a wonderful little brother but uh tell you what he is a pistol and so uh we want to be praying for them they're going to be out a little bit of r r and do a little bit of hunting and uh headed out to missouri and uh somebody calls it misery but i i actually like missouri pretty good so they're going to be back for next weekend so just be praying for them they're on the road today amen romans chapter 9 um just one single verse verse 23. paul speaking romans 9 23 and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had before prepared unto glory that wonderful hebrews chapter 2 and we'll catch one single verse in the book of hebrews paul speaking also and we're going to catch hebrews chapter 2 and we'll go to the 10th verse for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings let's pray father we thank you for your word this morning and i i have this burden still on my heart lord so i pray that today we're able to express our heart freely and openly to the people lord we realize we're in a perplexing age in a perilous age as the bible called it perilous times and father we know that the word of god has the answer for our lives we know lord that it is the it is the only source that can give us an answer to the to the extremes that we see going on in this day lord the world gr men's heart in in fear failing for fear groping in darkness lord such a fear of the unknown and the things that are coming upon humanity and lord it's a terrible time but yet it yet it's the most glorious time for the light of the gospel that's ever been for you're bringing portions of your word to pass today that have never been brought to pass lord in all the ages and we're seeing prophecy fulfilled in our lives father so we commit ourselves to you that's all we can do that's all i can do i want to just preach from my heart today lord my notes have been over and over and over it's all in my mind it's all in my heart and father we'll follow along but i want to be sensitive to your leadership for you knew who would be here today you knew who would be on the stream lord you knew who would be listening in either live or by archive so i committed now to you commit myself into your hands for service in jesus name amen god bless your friends you can be seated we we finished off last time in the uh with a couple of thoughts and you know i wanted to just maybe touch one or two of them from last weekend we realized that there there are many ways that we can go and live our lives in fact is the bible we reminded you of it last time the bible talks about how that there is a way that seemeth right to a man but it's actually not the right way and that in fact is if you end up going that way which seems right you can actually end up being destroyed think sir you can actually end up in calamity and destruction even all the way in death and so you know the book of jeremiah and i'm going to refer to a number of scriptures today we may not turn and read them all but the book of jeremiah makes a reference how that the way of a man is not within himself he can't find it now do you believe your prophets do you believe your prophets amen then then then hear the word of jeremiah the prophet it is not in you to discover your own way that in fact is the the bible goes on to say in other places that you know that the the heart is is deceitful and it's desperately wicked see that's why you have to be born again and so you have to get a new nature and that new nature comes with new characteristics so that you can live your life the correct way and in fact is it is so powerful it is so the word of god is so powerful that if you will just live your and keep your heart humble before the lord you won't even have to figure anything out god will just lead you the right way and so you know i i see a lot of people many times and you know they we and it's natural and not being critical of it i do it we all do it you you have a situation in your life you want prayer you come up for deliverance maybe you know in the areas of of overcoming and uh you know i've i've came up in prayer lines before wanting more power for overcoming how about you i and not always a prayer line sometimes i've set you know and under the preaching of the word and i came to this conclusion i need more of him and so i i realize when i came here i thought i had enough but now that i'm here and i'm hearing the word i'm realizing wow my my cup isn't full and i need some more from the lord and you know a lot of times we we can from our human side and we can we get the we get the idea that you know i need to come up and ask god you know you know help me with this and help me with that and really most often we can think of individual things and even if we're not confessing it to the preacher because this is not a confessional booth but you're you're saying you know i want to have more of a coming power you're thinking of something you're thinking maybe of a couple things that you need to you need some overcoming strength on you know one of the pieces of advice that i always give somebody whether it's here at the altar for prayer or whether it's in my office in counseling or on the phone and i say listen brother you know don't don't get the cart or sister don't get the card ahead of the horse because the bible promises in the holy spirit that you will have an overcoming power that's one of one of the things the holy ghost has given for amen so rather than rather than burning fuel as it were using up your energy sources trying to figure out how you can be an overcomer over this or over that why don't you burn all your fuel getting close to god and just purpose in your heart to say i'm just going to get more humble i'm going to pray more and i'm going to seek him more and i'm and i'm going to try to draw closer to him because if you do that i'm here to tell you something friends that gene of god that is down inside you when the anointing begins to fall on it and this word not just any word but when the full word falls in this age of the full day on a people who are to be the full believer who are actually here by designed to take a body change i'm here to tell you there's an anointing falling on this word that is sufficient to give you overcoming power today tomorrow next week i don't care what you've stumbled at it has the power to set you over the top it has the power to put you on a ledge on this mountain we're all climbing we're climbing mount zion amen and i'm here to tell you this anointing has a power to set you on a ledge you haven't been at before and not just set you there and leave you there but set you there and then take you to the next one and take you to the next one and take you to the next one i want to go to the next one i live to overcome i'm a christian it's my whole desire it's my everyday focus to not slip backwards but to press forward and that was paul's instruction that we press toward a higher calling there are so many ways and so many things that can influence our lives and there is nothing that is better to influence your lives than the word of god and god has by design placed you here to obtain glory amen by bringing him glory amen amen say it again god's not here to make you the most popular person in the world amen god's not here for the world to applaud when you step out on the street god's not god didn't put you here for that god put you here so that people will think about god god put you here as a beacon as a lower light as we've said before along the harbor they have the lighthouse on the hill but they also have lower lights along the harbor entrance because the lighthouse alone won't lead them into the harbor they'll crash so you have to have the lower lights burning if it's a tricky harbor especially and so so we find that that this is god's purpose for our lives it was astounding to me and there was so many different places that i that i could have read from but i i just i narrowed my search just to strictly the book of revelation because that's our book amen amen that's our book that's the bride's book for the end time it was written after paul was gone you know paul doesn't ever quote from the book of revelation because it was brought remember in our sunday school teaching john was trying to put all the bible together and god allows him to get arrested because god wanted the book of revelation put in there and all down through the ages it stayed in symbolism and things were not unlocked to the people but it was promised at the end time it would be made known because john was caught up to the lord's day said i was in the spirit on the lord's day that's this day that's the end time that's the time when we go home but before we go home we have a mission we have a job here and i'm here to tell you that's to get glory by bringing him glory and so i my message to you today is the glory way so what is the glory way it's whatever way that you need to live that brings him glory amen it astonished me i i really was caught off guard by how many references from the very first chapter of the book of revelation all the way nearly to the very end of the book you find that you know and i'm not i'm just going to i'm just going to just hit them quickly and not you don't even need to try to keep up with josh because i'm just going to go fast but we find in the in the first chapter of revelation to him be glory and dominion forever and ever the fourth chapter and when the beat and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that set on the throne who liveth forever and ever further on in the fourth chapter thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created so it's so our whole life is for his glory amen listen friends you know i i remember one time in um oh where was i at i was in uh i was in the ukraine and brother eugene was with me we were we had went to a a store because in the camp they had no telephones or internet and so we went to a place it was a place of business i i think they they printed flyers and business cards and things like that print shop and they had uh internet connection where we could you know uh text home and say how are you we're here we're good we're safe and there was a young woman sitting there and you know she we had been in there before and finally after about the third time you know we come in and she's she's all bubbly and all happy and she's almost a little bit giddy and almost silly and she's probably 18 19 years old and uh and i just thought wow you know somebody's in a good mood but then in a little bit she began we began to discover and she had been out the night before and she had been drinking and dancing and had met a boy and all these things and she's almost bragging here we are preachers and she knows we are and she's bragging about had me a good night last night in her best broken english and oh i said a good night is everything fine oh yes you know my friends and drinking and dancing and i'm so happy for today and she even stands up you know and tries to imitate a little jig that she had did the night before and i and i just thought wow how sad i felt like brother brandon when he was in that hallway you remember and those women were coming down one of them a sunday school teacher and they've got a you know whiskey in one hand and they're half dressed and they're kicking up their leg whoopee this is life and brother brandon said i tried to stay out of it he said but that was just more than i could take and he said i stepped out and said just a minute sister he said that's not life that's death see and and even he said she tried to pull away but he held on tight you remember brother branham when they had the company dance remember that and uh they said billy we're gonna we you know we know you're really a straight and shooter and you're a christian so just kind of stand over the side we're gonna have some we're gonna have some good clean fun brother brown's like oh good clean fun really yeah we're you know we're gonna have some good clean fun so brother branham goes and he walks in and here's a band playing all their rock and roll music and all these people out on the floor dancing and brother branham just standing there looking just a young man young christian and you know how the devil is and the devil gets a hold of the young woman he said a young woman out there on the floor dancing and jigging and vulgar and he said she saw him and here she come and she run and got him by the hand said you want to dance he said i sure do and she let him out onto the floor and he said now before i do anything let me stop the band just a minute before i do anything he said i always like to pray and ask the lord's blessing and he said she he said now if you all just get down on your knees and he went down to his knees and she tried to pull away and he grabbed her and pulled her down on her knees and he said lord you know we love you and he went on to his prayer and while he's praying the band started closing up their instruments started wrapping everything up everybody started leaving putting their drinks in the trash can i'm here to tell you something friends there is a way that seemeth right but there's another way that gives god glory and i want you my message to you today is get on the glory way live in the glory way i i remember i said to that to that young woman i said you know i felt like brother branham was more than i could take and i said you know that that that's a shame to see a young woman like you and i said you know that that's gonna send you to a devil's hell and it's gonna while you're while you're on your way to hell as if that ain't bad enough it's gonna it's gonna corrupt your body and poison your liver and maybe give you cancer and all kinds of you're gonna ruin your life and hurt you know you're gonna regret these things down the road and uh you know uh and and right away she just said just just just quickly i think she was expecting me to say something and she just said it's my body just held her hands up like that my body and i i said who told you that who told you it was your body oh you built it you brought yourself here you're the one keeping air in your lungs and her hands came down and she got quiet and i said listen sister you didn't build you you didn't give you life you can't hold on to your life god put you here for his glory and i said you you jesus god sent jesus christ to die and actually purchased you and i said god bill you god owns you god is offering you redemption you do not it is not your body and you ought to be thankful that you have preachers standing here giving you the the true gospel let me tell you something friends our lives have a purpose for being here and you might accomplish a lot of things in your life that might be rather spectacular you might soar in the fields of education and career you might you might you know become a very world renowned person nothing not saying nothing against that do all you can be somebody good be somebody the world can can can appreciate but understand this no matter what you ever achieve no matter what you ever accomplish no matter what station hear me no matter what station you ever achieved to with if if it's not christ guiding your life your life equals zero you get a big fat zero your life is worthless unless it's bringing god glory your life has no meaning or purpose unless you're in a glory road that's giving god glory he goes on to say in the fifth chapter he heard john heard a bunch of people you know he heard angels is who it was and angels around the throne saying and i love this they were saying with a loud voice they were saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and when those angels got going john got excited and then the bible says in 513 and every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and such as in the sea and all that are in them heard eyes saying blessing and honor and glory and power and then when john got excited then the four and 20 elders got excited and they fell down on their knees and said glory to god and praise the lord i'm here to tell you something friends start praising god it's contagious it'll move to somebody else and somebody else and before you know it we'll all have our hands up in the air saying worthy is the lamb praise our god and then god receives glory let them hear it on the streets on our outdoor speakers god deserves glory give him the praises that his name is due he goes on chapter 7 saying blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor chapter 11 the same hour there's a great earthquake in the 10th part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men 7 000 and the remnant were afraid and gave glory to god in the midst of calamity amen see gave glory to god chapter 14 saying with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth in the sea chapter 15 and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power no man was able to enter the temple verse chapter 16 and and and these are men in chapter 16 who were scorched with the heat of the judgments and the bible makes it a tragedy this verse is a tragedy because in all of their suffering they gave not god the glory see the only one who could help them i get astounded every time i read that in the bible that here are people suffering in the tribulation and they the only one who can help him they're cursing him what madness is this so chapter 18 he says and after these things i saw another angel coming down from heaven having great power and the earth was lighted with his glory chapter 19 and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power unto the lord god and then it goes to chapter 21. now watch it's come all the way through the bible remember the book of revelation is the book of our day it's the bride's book of this day a lot of it's been fulfilled since the time of the apostles i get that i'm not saying it only covers the history of our day but it's it's its primary purpose was so that the bride at the last time saw a prophet would have context and be able to to qualify to you what you see going on and and be able to explain modern events and make them clear to you through prophecy [Music] to have an authority a prophet has no authority outside of the word if he's a real prophet and so so that a prophet of this day would have authority to stand on god gives the church the book of revelation and so we find then that he could identify he could say here's a strong angel here's a mighty one here's this one here's that one here's john represents this represents that a a strong angel rising up out of the east with the seal of the living god and all of these things a prophet was able to establish what we believe from the bible i'm glad amen i'm glad because if i if i knew that my whole life was purpose to bring him glory then i would want an authoritative word that could accomplish it i wouldn't have any confidence because the stakes are too high because if i know my only purpose being here is to give him glory then nothing in life should equal that then if it's that important i need to make sure i've got the right path i need to know i'm in the glory way that's why i'm thankful for a message that's why i'm thankful for a prophet that's why i'm thankful he established it on the word of god incontrovertibly unassailable this message in the bible is unassailable you cannot resist it unless your steep stooped and willful blindness because god has made it so plain and not only has he made the interpretation plain it made the manifestation plain and we have it and we see it and we know it so he says chapter 21 i love this now watch so he says and there came unto me one of the seven angels had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city so he's going to show him the bride but now he's going to show him the representation of the bride because the bride is a people you understand and the city is built to reflect the character of god's glory that his word put in her that's why when he says he says the city having the glory of god and her her light was likened to a stone most precious even a jasper stone clears crystal and so the city itself is is is crowned with regal beauty and precious stones and everything in its place and that city is a testament to the world when they approach it because they're going to bring their honor into that city and before they ever see the bride set it seated by him on the throne they will see the beauty of what god could produce in a people and when they get inside the city having seen the city and see the bride they'll go oh yeah she matches no wonder she's seated on that throne i'm here to tell you something friends that's what this message has come to do it's come to put you in a glory way so that your life becomes glory which brings him glory and the whole city is glory hallelujah that's what the whole 21st chapter and in fact is every every remaining every remaining mention of glory is about this city [Music] 2123 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof 24 and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth to bring their glory and honor into it verse 26 and they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it your life here has that purpose behind it amen and there should not be anything allowed in our lives there should not be anything allowed in our lives that dim the glory of god to the world see amen now don't be all shouting with me on the first part and start getting quiet amen come on if we're gonna if we're gonna if we're gonna you know the w in the shepherds in the east they're in the middle east when they are have sheep and a lot of times when the the the little lamb is sick and they have a limestone that'll bring healing but you can't get the lamb to lick the limestone because it tastes horrible see what he does he reaches in his bag and he pulls out some honey and he smears it all over the limestone and the lamb starts licking like crazy on the honey and what happens as he starts breaking into the line and numbs his tongue and all he remembers is the sweet and he just keeps eating and he eats the heats the lion eats the limestone you know the limestone gets into his body and starts having its healing effect so hey there's honey in the rock amen amen and and so just remember friends that that is i think that that that's such the purpose that we're here for and i was thinking about brother jd's sunday school class this morning i thought wow i almost need to give him the first half an hour of my sermon time to just re-preach it now that we got a church full of people i hope if you weren't here you were at least streaming goodness because of all the of all the topics he's preaching about the character and the characteristics of god and he's been on love and working on divine love and agape love and feeling love and just astonishing you know i was thinking about this morning and you know you know just faith i was thinking about you and your career path that you said to me and you know i thought i'm going to say to sister faith when you and because i told her that's awesome that she wants to be a servant help humanity she has a career path to as a counselor and psychology and crisis intervention and these kinds of things i said faith that is amazing that that that could be a gift of god for suffering humanity that's why god said he that's why brother um said god gave us doctors see it's a mercy of god for suffering humanity and i thought to myself when i say i'm gonna tell her sister faith you'll never be able to help anybody unless you can learn the characteristics of god learn the principles of god and counsel them in that that'll give them more help than any other thing if you want to help somebody give them the characteristics of god teach them the ways of almighty god because he's more than history man he's much more than history there there's his acts but there's also his ways and so we find then that you know we want to be glad we want to rejoice in the lord you know when we when we look out here today and again i i have to always quickly set your mind at ease i'm not here to preach on politics i hate that stuff anyway but but it's so pervasive it's just like front and center in our face and and i'm not talking about who who can get in the office i'm talking about the the social political fabric the the the ways of the world and the way i mean here we you know people that maybe look like sensible people and you'd say you know they're crazy they're in the streets and they're writing and they're burning and and then you know they're fighting and they're attacking and and you you even even both sides are now saying i've i've even read to their credit some liberal commentators going are we nuts y'all come on everybody are we crazy you know no wonder no wonder there was a red wave that nearly we lost congress over no wonder we barely beat that president if they did in fact because even they know they're crazy amen and i'm talking about one of their leading leading one of their leading voices has said we could have easily won all this if we weren't so nuts and said you people out here doing things that don't even make sense he said come on friends it don't even make common sense what you're doing no wonder there was such a a red wave and he and he's right because people you know that's why i've always said you can tell when an evil spirit's anointing you you know why because you'll do things that don't make sense you do things don't make sense i remember speaking to a man who used to be in the message used to preach this message right from this pulpit and then he's on youtube making every kind of horrible video about the message and brother branham and the people that follow it and all this kind of and i finally said to him one day i said you know you've got an evil spirit he said you think so and i said no i'm saying you're evident that you do i said because an evil spirit will make you do things that don't make sense it don't even add up it's not common sense not even common sense and uh we weren't you know angry i was just just trying to help him and i said listen friend because i still consider him a friend i said you know i said here you are on the internet attacking a man who you know was a godly sanctified man who lived a life of purity and all of his peers said that and even his enemies said that even people who disagreed with his doctrine said he was a very humble sincere man of god and even they had him but the government tried they couldn't find any kind of thing against him and i said and further you know that it produces people who live decent and holy and godly and we teach our children the right things and we make makes good citizens out of us and and we're honest people and you're on there attacking it and you know what it produces and so that's that's crazy that you would do that and i said moreover you know by teaching of the bible you know that the real threat to this world is rome amen and i don't see you spending one minute on youtube telling the world about the real antichrist or telling them about the errors of jehovah's witness or or mormonism all i see you is on the air uh trouncing something you actually know is good and leaving off the things that you know is really killing the world and call yourself a preacher i said you're full of the devil because you're doing something that doesn't even make common sense [Music] that's that's stupid i'm sorry little kids i didn't mean but jason didn't mean to say that amen i apologize to moms amen so but that's crazy okay i'm sorry that slipped out but but it didn't make any it didn't make any sense then doesn't make any sense now and you know you remember brother branham talked about the craziness in the world he didn't call it juvenile delinquency all the world does brother bram never called it that he said it's all parental delinquency and and and you know what you see now you see say well they're grown-ups in the street out there well they were children once but the age their parents that brother branham was preaching to didn't listen the age that brother brennan was preaching to stayed with her with their little social parties and they didn't take the word of god and now what you're seeing is grown-ups back in the streets acting crazy because of the previous generation you remember brother graham said it just gets worse every generation you start out with a chorus girl and you go you know in the early 20s and then from there you go to flappers in the 30s and then from there you know the the fact the nation the motherhood of uh backbone of mother of the nation was broken women going to work after the world wars and and and he said and then you you get a striptease and he said what will the next generation be well now we know the answer we know the answer to that question brother brown didn't stay around long enough to see it we've seen it we see madness on in the streets we see madness everywhere even good people acting crazy i'm here to tell you something friends this age has become so dark but but at the same time the word has become so bright and you need not eat off the poi i'm so glad that you're not starving and have to eat out of a garbage can or eat toxins or poisons just to stay alive you have the pure seven course meal you have the purity of the word thank god thank god i have answers for you thank god parents have answers for their children amen you know it's it's it's incredible the age that we live in and the way that people uh don't care about their children and and you know put them on every kind of talent show and ruin them and push them into education never touch never teaching them about god never teach them about the holy ghost you know and and i'm i'm not of course sadly that ain't just in the world [Music] sadly there's there's good and i call them good very they're believers but they sure have got their vision clouded on what they push their kids into and i'm not at all against pushing your kids into what'll make them successful but how about you get them how about you push them with all your might to the holy ghost first how about you do that which will secure them eternally then work about then work on their life naturally instead of the other way around come on you know it's just sad that people don't seem to care sufficiently in a time you know when our children live in the most perverse day of human history how is it that the parents sometimes aren't fighting with all their might you know providing every opportunity they can even inventing opportunities to get their kids to church or to meetings or to fellowship do everything you can i'm talking about going to the wall and back you know we don't wait a lot of times you don't have any problem pushing them to a a nice education perfectly fine nothing to say evil about it you know i i'm glad that we've got people who have an education i and i believe that on a certain level of that it minimally you know because you you you're going to need to be able to teach your children hey we live in a modern world that's the world we live in so i'm not against career and education and achievement wonderful wonderful wonderful but but how do the priorities get so twisted to where either and i don't know which one is worse to where either sometimes parents who have gotten sideways in their in their priorities push their children toward education and achievement but there doesn't seem to be hardly any effort to get them filled with the holy ghost [Music] amen amen amen me just let me lower my presentation down just so you know i'm not attacking just speaking from my heart parents today here and on the internet whoever might hear this on an archive you should be going to the wall and back to get them full of the holy ghost get their eternal destination they're calling an election sure set the right kind of example then whatever god can open doors ahead of them then then help them find wonderful you know and and and it's and it's really distressing to see or sometimes and i don't even know if maybe this might be worse i don't know i'm telling you i don't know it might be worse uh where you just have a an indifference to whatever i don't even care and i'm we're just getting through life well i'm not i'm not trying to push them out there well you're also not trying to get them filled with the holy ghost you're just kind of indifferent to it all and and and i know this indifference is a worse enemy lukewarmness is a worse enemy than coldness because at least if you're cold you know where you stand and you know you need god if you're lukewarm and you just don't care i i remember i've told this story before i'm sure you've heard it but you know i had a sister come to me very distressed because she's trying to witness to her mother and mother gets so mad she tried to witness her out of the bible out of the message of the hour and her mother was i think a moss back baptist and she would just get so flaming mad and i said wonderful sister that's second best reaction she could have she looked at me like what i said sure she said what's worse i said indifference believe me it's much worse if she just says to you oh that's nice honey well anyway what were we talking about and it just it just passes her right by and she don't have any reaction at all that's that's when you're in a bad spot friends when you don't even care about right and wrong you don't care about the right path the wrong path the best path the not best the upside down the inside out you don't care about enough about your priorities to set them straight come on friends and and that that's a worse i said at least she had a reaction at least she cares about something brother brandon said i'd rather see a man stand even if he's wrong see him stand on a principle just so that he won't fall for anything see so you know this is the day to have some grit this is the day to care this is the data try to make a difference say i i can't give them the holy ghost you can't but your job as a parent is to provide them with every opportunity and then some and go to the wall and back find it like you're fighting a fire i mean go all out whatever you have to do spare no expense spare no expense if you want to do things that are crazy do that spare new expense you talk about crazy i think back on it now and i go i must have been nuts hand the keys to the family vehicle we only had one hand it over to my teenage boys because they want to go three states over to a christian youth banquet and i'm like here's the keys and people go you let them take your vehicle you know i got my work truck outside but you know what you know why i did that because i knew i have to i have to do everything i can and i have to invent things to do i have to create opportunities i gotta i can't rest day or night my job as a parent is to see them secured in their faith i couldn't give them the holy ghost but it was my job to provide everything in their life and in their schedule and set a right example i want to tell you something friends i don't think that my children got raised up i think if you'd ask any one of my boys they would not have the idea that my priorities that i didn't care about spirituality or that i didn't care about my church schedule i didn't care about the friends they had i cared about all of that stuff and i put my hand on and controlled it and intervened because why i couldn't save them but i wanted to give them every possible every single idea that i could come up with i think i made the right choice oh let me move on y'all going to go into vapor lock on me but it's true friends you know we get very concerned with better homes and better cars and you know which wind and rain can take away like that and jesus said why would you build your life on sand when the storms of life and they come oh they're coming you can best believe that they're coming so jesus said don't build your life on that because when they come they'll wreck everything you've done build on the solid rock of god's word and when not if when those storms come it'll stand it might even waver and you might lose a few pieces of trim but you can put it back i can put a few shingles back but i don't want to lose the whole house amen better devices better jobs better education got elite people even thinking they can game the system and pay money to get their kids in the best schools it's madness they're in prison now for it ruin their careers for it you see what they're chasing you see what laodicea wants you to chase after don't do it friends don't do it young people if mom and dad aren't don't have enough zeal you get some zeal if if they won't if they won't lead by example then just then just call on god and god will meet you and you can lead the family hallelujah i've seen that happen i've seen teenagers i've seen teenagers get it get enthused over the word of god get filled with the holy ghost and lead their parents into the message of the hour bring their parents back under the power of god don't tell me i'm gonna tell you something friends i pray that god will uh electrify every teenager in here with the power of the holy ghost and bring them into the glory way hallelujah that's why we preach it's why we gather you know i appreciate the parents you know and i get it you say well they're good kids well sure they are of course they are i mean good raising and church services will do that i get it i appreciate the parents that make that effort but that's not the limits of what god is expecting from you you know sometimes as a shepherd i find myself almost feeling like i need to go step in just step in front of somebody you know knock on their forehead and go hey god remember him come on and they're like oh yeah oh yeah thank you pastor thank you yeah i needed that thank you that's what i'm doing today it's the glory way i'm trying to tap you and go hey rapture remember that the holy ghost remember that i know the world's not all about your job your career and your social activities your whole life this life is not about this life how many times you heard brother jason say that this life is not about this life this life is about the next life hallelujah i'm living this one right to get to that one glory to god oh my this has seemingly been a been a repeating blind spot seemingly in every generation parents not willing to go to the wall and back it's not easy in fact it's hard to keep a balance life is just so necessary and busy amen it's true amen and i and i and i see plenty of parents going to the wall god bless you let me let me just not sound like today like i'm just trying to beat everybody up we're on the glory path and i see many parents going to the wall and back doing everything they can sparing no expense and so i want you to know it's not unnoticed you know we want to we want to build something out of the word of god amen the world there's no safety in the world amen god gave an example put a prophet here to give us an example how to how to live our lives how to think about education how to handle politics how to handle family members god but god caused a prophet to live in front of us as an example amen and so so you know we we have found that that his words 50 years ago have come to pass you know there's a lot of things brother branham saw and commented on that even today when i read them i go wow that was barely even noticeable in his day see but he was seeing as a prophet whose eagle eye looks a long ways off he was never going to see a lot of the stuff he was talking about in seed form and then i said to myself is that why we've still here 50 plus years later because god needed for our bride to actually fulfill to where it's not just seed anymore it's in the full realities the insanity he said in the 60s the world will go continually it'll get worse and worse and worse until they come completely insane and i'm here to tell you something friends we have arrived we have arrived i think that that's why we're still here and and and and you know when we when brother branham says here in in trying to do god a service without being the will of god 1965 one of the last things one of the last sermons he preaches he says you know sh you know show me the the results because you know here is uh here's a here's remember elijah almost mocking the false prophets cry louder see and so brother branham says show me the results why has this so-called revival this is 1965. he's he has spent his entire ministry pleading with pentecost come back to the word and they didn't do it and he's even got a a time where you know he's gave her a space to repent all down through the church ages until we get to the last one and you know because the cup of iniquity wasn't full that's why until until the cup of iniquity of the amorites was full israel couldn't go in you understand joshua couldn't take them over once that cup was full then they could go into exodus then joshua could take them over and and why why are we still here because you know why has the ages going because the cup of of iniquity wasn't full and now we've reached a time friends say what's the madness on the street the cup of iniquity running over it's pure poison and people drink it and swim around in it it's it's life that's what we've come to this isn't fantasy you're i'm telling you things you know you see it in the news we have a we live in the bible belt we live in a red state we live in a small seaside town we don't have a lot of direct contact with it but i'm here to tell you the nation is rife with it and we don't know yet what how crazy it might get we don't know no one knows i ca you can hear one pundit one of these talking heads get on there and go oh the incumbent has no chance there's no path he might as well give up now and then you hear another talking head go are you kidding he's got a perfect path if the courts do this and the courts do that and and i mean you're sitting there going wow what is about to happen in this nation i don't know some i don't know friends but i know this i want to be in the clef of the rock i want to be where i where i'm safe i want to know that god is in my life that god is anointing my kids that that god is anointing my grandkids that god is anointing your kids and your grandkids because we're marching to zion and i believe we're almost home he says show me the results why has this so called revival getting people back to church churches done to the nation to the body of believers it's nothing but made new organizations and denominations all the way along more members and so forth is the nation better they said they was going to you know america god brother branham now here now here he comes like elijah like mocking if you listen to the tape you'll hear it they say oh god bless america oh it's a nation it's a christian country brother branham says it's a million miles from a christian country he said i don't even pray for it how can i pray for it and it won't repent under the mighty powers of god demonstrated before it and deny the and closing the doors to it and walking away i committed to god she is going further away that's a prophecy now she is going to sink just watch what happens i'm here to tell you something friends we didn't need to wait on california we didn't need to wait on on hollywood to go under the under the waves to see the nation going under the waves so we have an anointing on this word it brings us to this glory way and that's my message to you set your life in the glory way set your children's path in the glory way stop stop putting them aside or stop putting them in your way or trying to live out your unfulfilled fantasies in your children did i say that out loud yeah i did because that happens i pray for the spirit of god to bring your family into his image that's what i'm praying for that the spirit of god will bring you into his image i know he has an image that he saw of you and your family before the foundation of the world and i pray every day lord bring them closer let this day be a little closer to that image now i don't know what that might cost you it might cost you quite a bit but i'm here to tell you if it if i'm able to pull it off and get you on the other side like i'm ordained to do you'll thank me you'll thank me for telling you the truth see let your life you know we want to see our lives become actively in the ways of glory because our life in glory is to bring him glory and and it's sad because almost all of humanity refuses to do that although god gave him life although god put the breath in their lungs they won't live they won't use that air to give him glory he put life in their bloodstream they won't use that life to give him glory see and so there's you know i'll tell you something friends you know i there there's hardly words let me just say this as a veteran as a christian for many years and i'll give you this this path to everybody that's younger start right here with my son who's my youngest and go across here to katie my grandchildren my wife brother brother andrew his family right behind sharon going there sister wanda there's hayley and going all the way back there's there's brother uh brother jackson and brother demars and going across here's the boys and the guys in the booth brother luther coming up back up this way all of you every last one of you going across here going back there all the way to the back hear me let me tell you something i've been doing this a while and i can tell you from experience that that that there is there is almost i tried to even put it in my notes and i i i i found it inept that there's hardly words to describe the feeling that you can have on a daily basis when you wake up in the morning and you know your life is pleasing to god when you go through the day and no matter what you encounter you're not afraid of it because you know he's near you you know all you have to do is whisper a prayer you know you could lay your hand on the sick and they'd recover you know you could cast out a devil you go to bed at night and you know you're safe in his arms and you know that you've lived the right way and you know that he's pleased and you can feel it there's hardly no words to describe but it can't imperfect contradistinction there's no misery for a christian so great as when you walk around and and the clouds of failure are hanging over you and you you're moping around and carnality oh my flee it take my word for it run back to christ get get your life back in prayer get your life back in church know that he's pleased with your life there's nothing you would ever do nothing you would ever accomplish no amount of money you would ever have it would never equal that feeling it would never equal that feeling and i've proven it i've proven it over the years i've proven it i'm going to have to skip this because i i want to just come to a close you see that city that we talked about josh let's pull it up give me john 18 st john 18 and we're going to go to verse 6. it's a beautiful verse watch this this is jesus in the gardens here comes the soldiers as soon then as he had said unto them i am he he said whom seek ye and they said jesus of nazareth and he said i am he they went backward and fell to the ground now these aren't ballerinas these are soldiers these are warriors with swords and staves and shields helmets they're used to killing people they're used to arresting people and here's jesus not a big man brother branham saw him said he was a very small man he said very very small he said he said i would say maybe he weighed 140 pounds and he said just very small narrow shoulders no beauty in him that we should desire he said but yet he said when he looked in my eyes he said it was like he said it was like you wanted to just burst in crying burst out crying he said yet it also had the look that if he would speak the world might end he said there's no way i can describe when he looked at me how that feel feeling felt and here is armed troops and they confront him in the garden of gethsemane why didn't they recognize him why didn't they recognize him jesus told him he said he goes on in the conversation he says i was with you daily in the temple you'd made no move and now here a man who's been preaching daily they've they secretly infiltrated his meetings and they sent the high priest sent him to arrest him they come back without him where are you where's he at well we we couldn't we couldn't arrest him why not never a man spake like that man a little bitty guy and he here he is they should have recognized him but they don't recognize him i thought to myself i wonder what it was what had that gethsemane experience done to him that they didn't even recognize him anymore i want to tell you something friends here's a man who had so surrendered his entire will who had been able to say not my will but thine be done a man who had cried under such anxiety that his his tears were bl had blood mingled in them that his sweat was mingled with blood and that's a medical they have a medical explanation for that under extreme under extreme stress that it can cause capillaries to frac to fray and blood can come out through your sweat and tears this is a man who knows the torture he's about to go into and he's about to volunteer for it and his human side says not my will thine be done you know why because he knew he had one way to be in and that was to give god glory and whatever it cost him he was there to give god glory and whatever you say what did it do to him whatever it did to him they didn't even recognize him and they said whom seek ye and he said jesus nazareth i am he and they immediately fell to the ground falling backwards in fear and he asked him again whom seek you jesus of nazareth i've already told you i'm he you know something friends i thought about i thought about i wonder if there was such glory such such such glory that there was a moment maybe when the when the veil of flesh was rent for just a moment and a little flash of the life that was in him flashed out i'm here to tell you something friends when god flashed on the scene people ran for their lives what was it in his life that was so surrendered to god that when he just said i am he was there some little crack that came was there just enough something come out of his eyes i don't know the bible doesn't record it only thing i know is from a little man rough burly soldiers collapsed and fell to the ground i want to live that kind of life that's the kind of glory that i want to have in my life and i wanted to say lord let let whatever it takes whatever direction you know something friends sometimes we have to re repent for just you know maybe you're not some secret sinner i hope that's not true of you i'm not a secret sinner but i make mistakes i i know you make mistakes but but but you know something friends in in in my life sometimes i maybe i'm not committing horrible sins thank god but i i have to repent for my for my earthliness just earthiness just humanness just this lower level that i wasn't designed to live in this age i was designed for another world and sometimes i just say god forgive me for my humanness i'm a little too earthy today i'm a little too earthly today oh i want to be filled with the holy ghost i want to live in the glory way of god i want my life to bring glory to him how about you bethel tabernacle you want your life to bring glory to god say in everything i do if i have a career let it bring god glory if i get an education if i have money if i have friends let my life bring him glory oh stand up with me church let's bring him glory today why don't you raise up a hand and say lord i want my life to glorify you i want my whole conversation to glorify you i don't want to be earthly i don't my you know i don't want to have earthiness i want to have heavenliness i want to have righteousness i want to have godliness as they play softly brother andrew just as you choose father hands went up everywhere lord and i feel in my heart very satisfied lord that i was able to unburden my heart i was able i feel challenged lord i i don't feel that the word has put me down i hope nobody has that kind of a feeling i didn't come here today i didn't spend the hours of preparation we didn't sing and get a an atmosphere ready just so that people could leave feeling down no lord i want them to feel challenged i wonder if the if the word of god pricked them a little bit well and good let it challenge them lord cause them to throw off earthiness oh god help our young people to maybe that maybe they would be honest enough in your presence today maybe just teenagers but they'd be honest enough in their heart to know and acknowledge to you lord i've been pretty earthy and i haven't really been as heavenly as i should be and maybe they'd just say lord forgive me and help me to be more more like you more heavenly more godly more righteous more sincere more dedicated grant it to us lord put us high up on the cleft lord put us high may people today rise higher than they've ever known on this journey climbing this mountain pressing toward the mark of the high calling [Music] i'm glad lord that other mountaineers from ages past have went ahead of me they they drove their stakes into the granite wall and they left their ropes hanging so that i could climb up too [Music] i'm so glad lord sometimes i've stepped out and slipped i'm so glad i had a safety harness on i fell 20 feet but the safety harness caught me it wasn't fun but at least i'm not dead i can get a hold of the rope i can put my foot back on the mountain and climb some more help us to climb lord we realize the world is falling to pieces there's hardly any positive outlook we can look toward i know the world oh my goodness lord they they promised the moon literally uh they're there to hear them talk everything's fine the future is wonderful well it is for certain people [Music] i want to be that certain people i want my future to be bright indeed i want my future to be clear i want to know that my life is pleasing to him that it's bringing him glory that i mean living in a glory way that i'm bringing him glory there is no greater feeling in the world that a man can have man or woman boy or girl no greater feeling to have than to know that your life is heavenly that your conversation your thoughts your mind are heavenly they stay on heavenly things you're above the fray you're above the darkness you're above the fear you're an eagle soaring high where the sun is shining living in the glory of god knowing that he's pleased with your life knowing that on that day when the rewards are handed out they'll call my name i'm glad to know that lord old friends you're going to want to hear your name called on that day you're going to want to hear your name called
