Sunday School: The Word Dynamo Pt.3 -Bro Matthew Smith
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] Lord, I want to humbly invite you into our Sunday school service, Lord, that could step aside, that anything that would be a hindrance to you, Father, you would cast down, Lord, that we would open our hearts to you. Open our our minds, Father, for instruction, might learn something, gain some knowledge of your word, Father. But but above all, Lord, we like we want your spirit to move to anoint our hearts that we could you could draw closer to us and that we would draw closer to you. So, Father, we ask you be with us in this service, through the remainder of the the day, through the the the worship service and the ministry. We invite you here this morning and we trusting that you will meet us here knowing that you never miss your appointments. We ask this thing the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Um we want to take a quick reading. Um and we want to read um Acts chapter 1. Um Acts chapter 1 and verse 6. I'll wait for you guys to turn. Um I'm going to just continue the thought that I' I'd um been um speaking on. Um I don't know what parts probably part three. I think the title I took was the word dynamo. Um and um this probably part three I think. So this is Acts chapter 1 and verse 6. It says when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? And he said unto them, it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power, but ye shall receive power after that that the Holy Ghost has come upon upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. Y'all can be seated. Um so um for a recap for anyone who wasn't here or just forgot um the sort of the the core of my thought here is um that here's in in Acts chapter one you have Jesus talking about um how the people would receive the the the saints would receive um power um through the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost. And we also read in um I believe it's sec yeah second Peter chapter 1 um where Peter lays out uh what we what we refer to as the statue of the perfect man um you know talking about adding to add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge add to and so on and there's a a quote from the message statue of perfect man where brother Brandham directly links that where he says um then to your faith add virtue. Now right there knocks a lot of us down. Yes, sir. Add virtue to your faith. That doesn't just mean living a virgin life, you know, like the woman or a man and so forth. That doesn't have nothing to do with that. The Bible said, we read over here in the book of Luke where it said virtue went out of him. Is that right? If we're going to be like him, we must have virtue. Then we must have it to be like him. And so um so here's brother Brandham directly, you know, showing how making this reference here about the statue of the perfect man that if you're going to be like Christ, if you're going to be in the statue of the perfect man, there must be virtue like Christ had virtue in order to be a Christian. Right? If you're going to be a a Christian, a real Christian, then then that means that you're going to be Christlike. And that's what the word Christian means is that to be like Christ. And if you're going to be like Christ, that must mean that you have to have virtue like Christ had virtue. And the way Christ had virtue was not simply not, you know, not to say that it wasn't a a godly or what brother Brandon refers to here as a virgin lifestyle, but rather that it was a reference he referenced here uh where Jesus said that virtue had gone out of him. Well, if we follow that back and and go read in the gospels that story where Jesus is, you know, in the crowd and the and the woman with the issue of blood um touches him in the crowd and he says, "Who touched me?" And and you know, they say, "You obviously, you know, there's a crowd around you. Why why are you saying who touched you?" And he said, "But I perceive virtue went out of me." We're all familiar with the story. Well, that word virtue in the gospels, the word virtue translates back to the Greek, the original Greek word is um the word dynamon. Um and it is um would translate more more uh to English as um uh force or miraculous power. And so when Jesus is saying that virtue went out of him, what he's saying there more uh more perfectly translated would be um that he felt miraculous power um leave his body. And so just kind of summing all that up, brother Brandham here is saying if you're going to be a Christian like Christ was a Christian, right? Okay, if you're going to be be Christlike, if you're going to be a real Christian and truly be Christlike, then that requires you to have power operating in your life the way Christ had power operating in his life. Okay. Um it it it's not um just simply, you know, putting coming to a church. It's not, you know, identifying yourself with a particular religion or a particular group. It is um nothing short of allowing the spirit of God to operate through you and to work um in the world through an actual supernatural power. And if that supernatural power is missing from your life, then there's there's a problem, right? Then you know you you you have not added virtue to your faith as you know as Peter taught. um you you cannot build the statue of perfect man without the supernatural power as one of the foundational planks. And so um we also talked about how just scientifically um you know this word um uh dynamon is the you know the Greek root for where we get the word dynamo which is a a um electricity generating machine right whether it's a big power plant or just a little polestar generator they're all a form of a dynamo and it's coming from that same original Greek idea of force or power. Now, in the scientific world, we're talking about generators. We measure this the capacity of a generator or how much power a generator outputs. Um, in um we use the the word scientifically, we use the word power to describe the output capacity of a generator and that's measured in watts or kilowatts or megawws if if you're talking about something real big. Um, and what that is scientifically is it's not just simply a a measure of energy, right? Like energy would be like how much heat you can get out of a out of fuel or something like that. But power is how much um we could say how much actual effect this machine can have on the real world, right? Um sort of an analogy that I took was that if you know the amount of energy a truck has is how much fuel is in the tank, how much power it has is how big of a load it can haul, right? Same thing with a generator. If you've got, you know, 30 kilowatts coming out of a generator, that's a direct measure of how many electric motors this thing can run, how many light bulbs it can turn on, how many pieces of equipment can operate off of this, how many appliances can run, how many air conditionings can it air conditioners can it power up. That's all it's the capacity to do work in the real world. So likewise, you know, we look at um you know, if if you want to see the the measure of the power of God in your life, it's not just simply how excited you are, right? It's not how high you jump and up and down in church. It's not how loud you shout amen. Those are all good things. Nobody is is telling you not to do those things. Those are all very good things, right? But at some level it has to come down to what does your lifestyle look like? What is the if the power of God is operating in your life it is affecting change in the world through you in your life with your hands doing it is God operating through you and if it's not then there's not any real power there right and I I took like I said I'm a um the reason why I'm taking that kind of the analogy of the of the of the dynamo of the generator is because that's what I do every day I'm a mechanic I work on generators um and you know so we can draw some analogy there. Now, one of the things that I uh mentioned last and I thought it was so perfect um the way it just the timing the Lord's timing was so beautiful um in this um where you know I I had mentioned last last time I I did Sunday school um that just talking about how uh like I said before you know you can have a big a big energetic church service right a lot of people jumping up and down a lot of people you know shouting and and hollering and and like I said not not bad I I have no uh nothing against any of that um per se, but if that's the extent of your experience, if it if it never goes beyond excitement at church, &gt;&gt; then you there's no real power there. Um it's not really doing anything. And it, you know, you can because if all we're looking for, if the extent of the of the, you know, air quotes power of the spirit is simply to make you excited, well, you can get the exact same effect at a rock concert. You can get the exact same effect at a ball game. You know, I was not always a good Christian boy and there were many times I've been to rock concerts and let me tell you, they will get you in a in a particular atmosphere, right? They you you become emotionally engaged in what's going on there. Um, you can see it when when an entire auditorium full of people gets in one mind and one accord and they are all focused on what's happening on that stage and they're all in tune with the music and it there's a there is a a a unifying that takes place there. Um and what happens you know so me I you know with educational background that I have um was was blessed with um one of the things that I a class that I was required to take in college it wouldn't have been my choice um but I was required to take a class an anthropology class and the only at that point only class available to me at that time was a um class called the anthropology of magic and religion. in and they go through all like the world religions and the idea is just basically give you an overview of what are all the cultural beliefs of all the various major world religions. Um and the you know the the professor was like we're they didn't really focus on Christianity much just because you know you're in America you're all familiar with Christianity. You already know what that is. Um but what is what do what do the Muslims believe? Actually most of y'all most people haven't really had any real serious direct contact with Muslims to really know what they believe. um uh or or even like um uh so you know or Hindus you know you don't really you know you see a couple Hindus from time to time but you don't really you know there's not you're not really familiar with what they believe so you know they they kind of did a lot of that but then they cut got all the way around and said you know at the end of the day take something like um like uh the African practice of hudu or um even like the um sort of central American um practice like Santaia or like the um um like the the the Norse like the pagan European pagan stuff or the Native American religions or all these different pl all these sort of you know for lack of a better word sort of um I don't want to say primitive but anyways like you we all know what we're talking about like the African the African religions things like that um native you know you know bush bush religions um these all almost universally fall under a blanket category called category called shaman ism and we as Christians we would look at a lot of that stuff and say well that's witchcraft and you're not necessarily wrong but to the people of the land that's their religion that's just what they believe right they believe in in gods and spirits and things like that and they believe they communicate with their gods and spirits through their various practices and so that's kind of why it's in in a religion class right what we think of as as witchcraft is sort of their religion it's what they believe Well, so they they kind of did this big overview of shamanism because it pretty much every continent, every culture, every group, every every people on the earth, if you run their c their their religions, their native religions back, they almost all land in in some form of shamanism. And we can put them all in one box. There's a lot of key things that are similar that unite all these religions together. One of them is just sort of a belief that there's all these like natural spirits, whether it's your ancestors or nature or, you know, animals and plants or the earth itself or whatever. There's some sort of spirits in the world. And that this shaman, this guy, he's going to he's going to um do some ritual and he's going to allow those spirits to communicate through him to the people. That's kind of the fundamentals of shamanism. and they're going to do this and they're they universally all of them have a unifying fundamental um plank to the way they're going to do this and that is through the use of rhythm music all of them they all whether it's a Native American beating a ton whether it's a African beating a drum or a Cambodian guy re shaking bells whatever it is whatever the sham wherever you go in the The shaman uses rhythm to enter a trance to communicate with the spirit world. That's what they do. &gt;&gt; Um and um now most of the time they also use some drugs to do that too, but that's neither here nor there. Um but the point is you have you have some shaman who's kind of leading this operation. Then you have all the people around them who are kind of uh taking part in this though not necessarily participating and they're listening to the music. They're waiting for him because he's going to be this portal to the spirit world that's going to tell them what what they need to know, whether he's going to give them some sort of prophecy or whatever. And what we can do scientifically, so there's a whole, you know, scientists were really interested about this like, wait a minute, why is it that all these religions do this? What is the effect that this practice this this because you have all these independent cultures all developing the same thing all at once and all together. Why why is this? Well, one of the things they found out is that rhythm, rhythmic music, right? So, drumming specifically, anything with percussion rhythm, one of the things that it does is it um adjusts your heart rate to fall in line with the rhythm. Um it will literally your heart rate will will change to match the rhythm of the music that you're listening to. And they also found that the rhythm of the music, whatever shamanistic religion that you're talking about, they all their their rhythm, their drumming or their their whatever rhythm, because not all of them use a drum, but you get my point, whatever whatever their percussion instrument is, all of it falls within a particular narrow beats per minute band, right? It's a it's a specific thing. Okay? So what they found is that there is some sort of physiological effect on your body that the the music that a shaman plays to bring people into a spiritual state of mind literally has a medical effect on your body. It medically affects your mind and it literally gets everyone who's listening it to sync their heart rates and get everyone in one mind and one accord. That is what and in doing that in doing that okay it you know because again the principle and I and I'll say this um I say all this to because because I want to I want to make a point here right my point isn't that you know all I'm not advocating I'm going to go do p practice some shamanism by no means um the point here is that you know we we talk about physics in the world, right? There's physics. I can I if there's an object here, I could push it and it would fall, right? Gravity exists. We you know, you throw something up the air, what goes up must come down. Um, you know, for we we understand how the physical world moves and objects interact with each other. But there's a spiritual world as well, and that spiritual world has physics, too, &gt;&gt; right? There's a physics. I mean, it's beyond what we really comprehend, but there's there's rules and and and and for lack of a better word, scientific laws in the spirit world just like there is in the physical world, right? And the the laws of the physical world are not there's no morality associated with them per se, right? The same laws of physics that, you know, make a firearm operate so you can shoot a deer and feed your family are the same laws of physics that operate for some criminal to shoot an innocent person. Okay? There's no it's the same laws of physics. It's it's all sort of it's the it's a tree of knowledge, both good and evil, right? The same laws of physics that can make a power plant, power your home, make a bomb that can blow up your home. It's all it's it's just it's sort of morally neutral laws that that function. The same thing happens in the spiritual world, right? Being in one mind and one accord doesn't make you good. It just makes you unified. It means that you have power. Power is not necessarily just the notion of power isn't necessarily make doesn't just make you good. It you know righteous. It makes you powerful. It's not the it's not the same thing. Um, you know, the we look at the Tower of Babel. The people at the Tower of Babel were united. They were in one mind and one accord. They had a united language. They were they were so one with one another that even God himself, Jehovah, looked and said, "I can't stop them. Whatever they're going to do, they're going to do it unless I break their unity." Okay? So here you have wicked people using the laws of the spiritual world to be powerful in a in an unrighteous way. &gt;&gt; Okay. The same thing happens the exact same thing happens or I or I let me just say it like this. If the the the you know wicked people can become unified can get into one mind and one accord can use music right. I mean, talk to talk to some missionaries, talk to some people who have experienced some of these um shamanistic uh rituals and things. They'll tell you there's some power that can go on there, &gt;&gt; right? People doing superhuman things that, you know, that's not, you know, talk to Brother Jason. Brother Jason's mentioned it over the pulpit several times. You know, some of the things that he's seen in in Africa and whatnot, some of the rituals that he's that he's observed. um you know these these are you know I've talked to various other ministers um and missionaries and things whatnot people have seen this stuff and it it's it it is a supernatural power there and it's but it because they're tapping into sort of the the the physics of the spiritual world. It's not a um doesn't make any of that stuff righteous. It just makes it powerful. And the same way in the same way that you know um I I should have put it in my notes and I and I didn't. Um I believe it's in spoken word's original seed where brother Brandham talks about how the last day referring to how it would be so close as deceive the very elect if it were possible. And he was literally referring to supernatural vindications. And he talked about how at the last day you would have you would have the nominal Christian world have signs and wonders operating amongst them. That it would be the real deal supernatural operating, but it wouldn't be the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; It'd be the power of Satan operating in their church and people would be drawn to that because they would see something supernatural and think that's God. It must be. But it's literally the power of Satan. And he said the only way you would know the difference is you have to bring it back to the word test. If you want to find the quote, look up the phrase the word test. Okay? you bring it back to the word test because the the if if what they're doing if the supernatural power on display is not in the line in the order of God's word, then it can't be God, right? There has to be there's there's there's an actual um uh there's criteria there, right? There's there's things that are in place, ways for you to know that it's whether it's God or not. Um, one thing that specifically in in the quote that I'm thinking of right now, um, Brother Brandham said that one of the ways that you would know is that there would be no divine healing because Satan cannot cast out Satan, &gt;&gt; right? That they would do all kinds of supernatural things, but they would be lacking true divine healing. Um, so, you know, just the these are things that I, you know, I feel that we're towards the end times. I think we're we're running towards the end of all of this and and these are things that we have to bear in mind as we see the world around us becoming more and more religious as we see um you know and and it's shocking you look at the at the younger generations young people people you know young men under 30 is are flocking back to church it is go go look at some of the the the statistics out there they you know there various research groups like Pew Research and different ones that do cultural surveys of of the younger generations and and you know religiously um young men and increasingly young women. It's not less so amongst young women, but it's increasingly going that direction as well with amongst young women. Um but young men in particular are um probably one of the most um conservative and religious generations of young people since the 1940s. Okay. Your typical young man today is is far more religious than their parents are typic by by statistically, right? Um many many young men are going back to church where they're where they were raised atheist. They were, you know, raised, you know, nothing, you know, or or if they were it was a sort of a, you know, Christmas and Easter kind of religion if they had any religion at all. But now they're very devout. They're very traditional, very hardline in what they believe. Um, so as we see the world going in that direction, as we're seeing, you know, things shift that way, bear in mind, um, you know, it's going to be deceptive. What what's coming, don't be surprised if you start seeing signs and wonders operate in the nominal Christian world. Don't be surprised. Don't be surprised if you start seeing supernatural things because that's there. That is the devil literally trying to create something because so many people who are in it for fishes and loaves. So many people whose only real relationship with the message of the hour was that brother Brandham did some miracles one time. &gt;&gt; Right? That's the extent of their revelation is that well I know this is true because brother Brandham did some miracles. If that's the ext if that's your the the foundation of your revelation friends you better really get serious right? You better really know what you believe. You better get into the word and really understand. Put what you believe to the word test. Do you believe it because it's the truth? Do you believe it because it's it lines up with the word of God? Or do you believe it because, you know, it because it's what you were raised to believe? Do you believe it because, you know, there was some supernatural things one time? You know, because if that's the extent of it, listen, you know, the Bible talks about how Jesus gave power unto the 12 that included Judas, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Okay. There were there was m there was healing done at the hands of Judas a scariot. &gt;&gt; Okay. Don't just because there's supernatural associated with it does not mean that it's a it's a it's a it's a um you know that it's in line with the word of God necessarily. Be careful in this day and age. Know what you believe. Learn the word. Be educated in the word. Remember what we said. Add to your faith virtue in this context. Add to your faith uh power but add to your power knowledge. &gt;&gt; Right? Don't stop there. There's a lot more to the statue of a perfect man than just belief and and supernatural, right? You you need to have knowledge. There is there's actually godly knowledge. We don't you know there knowledge doesn't save you. Knowledge doesn't redeem you, but it sure does make it and like I'll use this example as I'm as I'm wrapping up here. amount of time, you know, um you get people who get all uh energized, you know, and a lot of faith and say, "Well, you know, when the devil comes against you, just speak with faith. It is written." Well, it would really hope help if you knew what was written, &gt;&gt; right? You actually have to know because remember if you read if you read Matthew chapter 4 in there when Jesus in the wilderness and Satan is coming to him and saying you know tempting him the sec because there's three times Satan came to him the first time he you know um with uh tempting him to to use his power to make bread the second and Jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but then the second time uh Satan comes to him Satan came to Jesus and said it is written And Jesus responded, "It is also written." So if you don't if you have no knowledge of the word, if you're you are ignorant of the word, you you're you're so focused on on feelings and emotions and and and big church services and and energetic services that you never take the time to get godly teaching and instruction and get into your Bible and read the word and read the message and know where you stand and have some actual just fundamental education on these things. Then what will happen is the devil will come and drag you around &gt;&gt; with with you know some outof context scripture and will lead you into any you'll be blown around by every wind of false doctrine because you have no actual foundation in the word. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So we'll stop there. We'll let's stand and have a quick word of prayer to end. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for this this morning. Thank you for this time that we've been given Lord to focus on your word to maybe be maybe learn something maybe uh bring our minds close to your word that Lord that something that you would have for us would strike our hearts. Give us give us courage. Give us strength. Father give us another sharpen our swords just a little bit more that we could fight the devil a little bit better. Lord, we ask your your spirit would remain with us through the service. Be with us in the song service and in the ministering of the word throughout our days and weeks, Lord, be with us. We ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
