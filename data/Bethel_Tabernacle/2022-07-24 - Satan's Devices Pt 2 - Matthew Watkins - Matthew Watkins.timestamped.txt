[3:15] s
[3:18] amen
[3:20] Ephesians chapter 4.
[3:25] we just want to continue where we were
[3:27] last Sunday on Satan's devices we're
[3:30] going to be looking at that again
[3:31] Ephesians 4 let's just begin reading
[3:34] that verse 17.
[3:36] this I say therefore and testify in the
[3:40] Lord that you henceforth walk not as
[3:42] Gentiles walk and the vanity of their
[3:45] mind you can I'll mute that here
[3:49] so if we could put up someone could put
[3:51] up Ephesians 4 I see some people don't
[3:53] have their Bibles so I want to make sure
[3:55] we read that this morning Ephesians
[3:56] chapter 4 verse 17.
[3:59] catch up with me if you can
[4:01] Verse 18 having the understanding in
[4:03] Ephesians 4 18. having the understanding
[4:07] darken but being alienated from the life
[4:09] of God through the ignorance that is in
[4:11] them because of the blindness of their
[4:14] heart who be in past filling have given
[4:18] themselves over until lasciviousness to
[4:21] work all uncleanness with greediness but
[4:25] you notice this verse 20 but you have
[4:28] not so learned Christ
[4:31] if so be that you have heard him and
[4:34] have been taught in other words assuming
[4:36] that you have heard him and have been
[4:39] taught by him as the truth is in Jesus
[4:42] it's not in any man it's in Jesus right
[4:46] so that was our personality we don't
[4:48] follow personalities except one and
[4:50] that's the personality of Jesus right
[4:53] that you put off concerning the former
[4:56] conversation the old man notice that you
[4:59] put off
[5:00] the com that concerning the former
[5:02] conversation the old man which is
[5:05] corrupt according to the deceitful lusts
[5:08] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[5:12] mind and that you put on the new man
[5:16] you cannot attack your new nature you
[5:20] can't take your your old nature right
[5:23] and and and Tack it or let me say it
[5:26] this way you can't take the cross and
[5:29] Tack it to your own nature you've got to
[5:31] take your own nature and Tack it to the
[5:32] cross and say that's that's former
[5:36] all things the Bible says are dead and
[5:39] everything has become new so that means
[5:41] every part of you when you receive the
[5:44] when you receive Christ into your heart
[5:46] every part of you is changed can you say
[5:49] Amen
[5:50] and let's read that again verse verse 24
[5:52] and that you put on the new man which
[5:54] after God is created in righteousness
[5:56] and true Holiness wherefore putting away
[5:59] lying speaking notice put in the white
[6:02] line speak every man truth with his
[6:06] neighbor for we are members one of
[6:09] another be ye angry and sin not what a
[6:15] mystery
[6:16] be ye angry
[6:18] and sin not let not the sun go down upon
[6:23] your wrath neither give place to the
[6:26] devil
[6:27] let him that stole still no more but
[6:31] rather let him labor working with his
[6:34] hands the thing which is good that he
[6:37] may have to give to him that needeth you
[6:39] can be seated this morning we'll just
[6:40] have you be seated and we'll go through
[6:42] some of these
[6:44] I want you just to hold your place open
[6:46] to Ephesians chapter 4 and we're just
[6:48] going to go through this verse by verse
[6:49] let's look at it again in verse 25. so
[6:52] this is the new nature this is what
[6:55] happens when when we read Ephesians 4
[6:58] we're reading applicable things that we
[7:01] could apply to our life you know when
[7:04] you read the Bible when you read it
[7:06] special Ephesians 4 and you read all the
[7:08] way down
[7:09] and we're going to get to verse 32 this
[7:11] morning you're not reading a way of life
[7:17] you're not reading a suggestion
[7:20] to live a good life
[7:22] you're not you're not reading this is
[7:24] this is this is just a way of life if
[7:26] you choose to live this way as a
[7:28] Believer but let me say this you're not
[7:31] reading a way of life but actually
[7:33] you're reading the way to life
[7:37] so this is the way to life if you want
[7:39] to live this is how you live so long
[7:42] before there was a religion that we call
[7:44] Christianity our religion was called the
[7:48] way
[7:48] that's what Jesus the religion that
[7:51] Jesus started was called the way they
[7:54] called them Christians first to Antioch
[7:55] because they were like Christ right
[7:59] so Christianity is just a name that
[8:01] we've termed people who are like Christ
[8:04] or people who are striving to be like
[8:06] Christ but long before they gave it
[8:08] Christianity it was called the way and
[8:12] Jesus gave that title himself when he
[8:14] said I am the way now he didn't say I'm
[8:17] away or a suggested way but I'm the way
[8:21] I'm the only way
[8:24] so there's only one way to get life and
[8:27] that's through Christ it's not through
[8:28] religion it's not through formality it's
[8:31] not through come conforming to something
[8:33] but you've got to get his nature
[8:36] to get life
[8:38] I know it's very simple but I just
[8:40] thought about these things this morning
[8:41] as the Lord was dealing with my heart
[8:43] how profound it is there's only one way
[8:46] to true life there's a lot of
[8:49] substitutes that give temporary pleasure
[8:52] and temporary happiness but let me just
[8:54] say this until you find until you're
[8:58] sowing that type of life it's really all
[9:00] corruption everything else is just
[9:02] corruption so it's the way not a way but
[9:05] the way there's only one way
[9:08] to life and what is true life this what
[9:10] we live here
[9:12] is not real life
[9:15] I know it's how we make sense of things
[9:18] in our uh you could call it our our data
[9:22] our feedback that we get is just this
[9:25] life it's our point of reference but
[9:27] really brother Brandon said this life is
[9:29] just a negative
[9:31] to a positive
[9:33] so everything that happens in this life
[9:35] is dying you're going one step every day
[9:37] you wake up you're one uh one day closer
[9:40] to a grave
[9:42] one day closer to corruption one day
[9:44] closer to your body breaking down your
[9:46] mind breaking down
[9:47] so this is only a negative but there is
[9:50] a life that we've tasted of
[9:53] that's why we're here this morning
[9:55] so we've we know what real life is
[9:57] because we've tasted of it so there's
[9:59] there's as Jesus said I am the way so
[10:02] when you find the way to life then you
[10:06] learn how to live the way of life so
[10:08] there's only one way of life and that's
[10:11] that's Christianity that's to be to be
[10:14] Christ to be like Christ let's back up
[10:16] and let's go to verse 25. you got your
[10:18] Bible if you got it just hold your place
[10:20] there
[10:21] open it uh with me Ephesians 4 wherefore
[10:24] putting away notice this is talking
[10:26] about putting away the old man putting
[10:29] on the new man
[10:30] which after God has created in
[10:31] righteousness and true holiness
[10:34] verse 25 wherefore
[10:36] putting away lying
[10:38] so one of the first attributes of a
[10:42] Christian is that they're truthful
[10:47] they're truthful with others and they're
[10:50] truthful with themself this is part of
[10:52] the new nature wherefore putting away
[10:55] line speak every man truth with his
[10:59] neighbor for we are members one of
[11:02] another so we we speak the truth that's
[11:05] why that's why when you are when you
[11:08] when you live hypocrisy and you don't
[11:10] speak the truth it's a breeding ground
[11:13] for pretense
[11:16] it's a breeding ground for facades and a
[11:19] lot of churches are just facades where
[11:21] people are so afraid of stepping on each
[11:23] other so we live in a culture where
[11:25] we're so afraid of stepping on each
[11:26] other's feelings
[11:28] that we don't ever speak the truth
[11:30] but you know the truth is the only thing
[11:32] that will set people free
[11:35] and I'm not talking about speaking the
[11:37] truth by holding up a sign out here on
[11:39] Boundary Street repent or perish
[11:41] and every time people drive by you've
[11:43] got a megaphone and you're screaming in
[11:45] their ears there's a way to speak the
[11:47] truth in love
[11:50] and not worldly perverted love not
[11:53] Hollywood movie Love
[11:55] but true Christian love
[11:57] let me just say this true Christian love
[11:59] christ-like love is polar opposite of
[12:03] Hollywood love
[12:06] amen
[12:08] so you speak the truth notice this very
[12:11] simple wherefore put it away line speak
[12:13] every man truth so when the truth is
[12:17] being spoken not just from the pulpit
[12:21] but from your lives when truth is being
[12:24] spoken when we're honest one with
[12:26] another when we can be honest with with
[12:28] one if there's any place you should be
[12:30] able to be honest and not uh not put on
[12:32] a facade it's around believers
[12:34] because there's real love where
[12:36] Believers are
[12:38] if there's not real love I doubt you're
[12:39] in the company of real believers
[12:42] so real Believers There's real love so
[12:44] you put away lying that means you put
[12:46] away you put away falsehood you put away
[12:49] dishonesty and you become honest now
[12:51] there's a way to do that you don't just
[12:54] you it doesn't mean to speak bluntly
[12:56] when someone you know asks you how do
[12:58] you like the color that I painted my new
[13:00] house well you don't have to just say oh
[13:02] it's terrible it's horrible well why did
[13:04] you say that well I've got to speak the
[13:05] truth and honesty I can't lie well
[13:08] there's a way to speak the truth
[13:11] that look right
[13:13] so he says here for wherefore putting
[13:15] away lines speak every man truth with
[13:17] his neighbor for we are members one of
[13:21] another
[13:22] this is an amazing verse verse 26. be ye
[13:26] angry so let's just pause there in other
[13:29] words this emotion
[13:32] is okay
[13:34] in and of itself it's okay
[13:37] being angry is okay it's what the Bible
[13:40] says be ye angry but there's a way to
[13:44] another you say brother Matt what is the
[13:46] purpose of this this is what he's saying
[13:48] because you find it right after he says
[13:49] be angry and sin not let not the sun go
[13:52] down on your wrath in other words you're
[13:54] going to be angry but I don't want you
[13:57] to do what the devil's devices is to do
[13:59] is for you to bottle up that anger
[14:03] because people have became unexpressive
[14:06] and they're not they're not able to
[14:08] express what they feel
[14:10] because they're afraid of of of shame or
[14:13] they're afraid of judgment or they're
[14:15] afraid of conflict and the Bible says be
[14:18] angry and sin not let not the sun go
[14:20] down in your wrath in other words it's
[14:22] you're going to be angry but don't
[14:24] bottle it up when a man when a husband
[14:27] and wife are angry at each other and
[14:29] they bottle it up then it becomes
[14:31] poisonous and it breeds bitterness
[14:34] and it breeds malice
[14:37] so Paul is saying be angry you're going
[14:40] to have to express it but don't sin so
[14:44] when does anger become sin when it
[14:46] becomes revengeful or it's anger that's
[14:48] expressed to be spiteful or it's anger
[14:51] that's expressed to tear someone down
[14:53] that's angry and sinning
[14:57] but when you're angry you're expressing
[15:00] something and you're not sinning that's
[15:02] a that's a miracle but we believe in
[15:04] miracles
[15:08] you can if you have the nature of Christ
[15:10] brother Brandon said even talks about a
[15:13] bad temper and I don't I don't want to
[15:16] uh misquote the prophet but it was
[15:19] something to the effect of how do you
[15:21] get rid of a bad temperament brother
[15:23] random says on your knees
[15:25] on your knees through prayer
[15:27] so be angry be emotional this is an
[15:31] emotion and we're to be emotional we're
[15:33] emotional creatures but the problem with
[15:35] just emotion
[15:37] non-tempered is that it's uncontrollable
[15:39] emotion and any emotion that's
[15:41] uncontrollable if that's not subject to
[15:44] the nature of Christ will always give
[15:46] you the wrong result
[15:48] but emotion that's tempered emotion
[15:51] that's humble emotion that has is is
[15:54] mixed with love emotion that's
[15:56] controlled by the Holy Spirit the Bible
[15:58] says express that be angry and sin not
[16:02] let not the son go down upon your wrath
[16:04] that's remember when we read these
[16:07] things this isn't a way of life it's the
[16:09] way of life it's the only way
[16:11] it's not well you have that you know
[16:12] brother Matt that's a good little be
[16:14] angry and sin not and don't let the sun
[16:16] go down in your wrath that that's all
[16:17] good and you know and fine and we'll try
[16:20] our best uh to do that no this is a
[16:22] command this is a this isn't this is a
[16:24] this is how to live a Christian Life
[16:27] Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath
[16:29] apologize make it right don't bottle it
[16:32] up because when it becomes bottled up
[16:34] then it breeds bitterness
[16:37] neither give place what a good thing to
[16:40] say right after fight after say and be
[16:42] angry and sin not let not the sun go
[16:43] down on your wrath neither give place to
[16:47] the devil don't let your anger give a
[16:51] place to the enemy
[16:53] because remember we preached on
[16:54] Wednesday on being changed and he'll
[16:56] take your emotions he'll take that
[16:58] conscience memory reason imagination
[17:00] affection and he'll stop it up stop up
[17:03] the flu and he'll take a place there and
[17:05] then you'll you'll blow up blow it up
[17:07] Christians remember that
[17:09] verse 28 let him that stole still no
[17:12] more but rather let him labor working
[17:14] with his hands the thing which is good
[17:16] that he may have to give to him that
[17:18] needeth notice verse 29 let know
[17:22] corrupt communication proceed
[17:26] out of your mouth
[17:32] let me give how sometimes we interpret
[17:34] that in their mind do your best to limit
[17:36] corrupt communication
[17:39] do your best do your best to you know
[17:42] make it as as minimal as nope let know
[17:45] corrupt communication
[17:48] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[17:52] is good
[17:54] to the use
[17:56] of building up
[17:59] to the use of reinforcement
[18:02] to the use I'm reading you what edifine
[18:05] means when when when real edification
[18:08] comes
[18:10] it's corrective can be corrective to the
[18:13] purpose of building
[18:16] to the purpose of restoring to the
[18:19] purpose of reconciling to the purpose of
[18:22] encouraging and so anytime it's doing
[18:26] anything opposite of that it's corrupt
[18:29] communication
[18:31] and what do we do when we preach the
[18:33] gospel we're communicating so the gospel
[18:36] can become even through the preached
[18:37] word can become corrupt corrosive
[18:39] communication when it's not tempered
[18:41] with love when it's not set in the right
[18:43] spirit I never forget when I first
[18:45] started preaching one of the first
[18:47] things my dad told me as one of his only
[18:49] piece of advice and I that I remember
[18:52] anyway and I was really one of his only
[18:54] pieces of his advice he said I get one
[18:56] piece of advice don't ever preach a pet
[18:59] peeve don't ever do it it's very simple
[19:02] don't ever preach a pet peeve don't ever
[19:05] preach your soapbox
[19:07] anytime you feel like you're coming
[19:08] behind the pulpit and you're preaching
[19:10] your pet peeve or things that are
[19:11] bothering you it'll never produce the
[19:14] result of the fruits of Christ
[19:16] never
[19:18] you never preach your pet peeve because
[19:20] you can say all the right things and I
[19:23] remember my uh it's funny my other
[19:25] father my wife's dad my father-in-law
[19:28] told me one time and he's famous for
[19:29] saying it you can be right and be 100
[19:33] right in something but that doesn't give
[19:36] you the right to say it
[19:39] you can be right but if it's corrupt
[19:42] communication you don't have the right
[19:43] to say it
[19:45] so you can say all the right things but
[19:47] say it have all the right content or
[19:50] substance but if it's said with the
[19:52] wrong Spirit or the wrong attitude and
[19:55] you'll do no good you'll only do harm
[19:58] remember our very simple principle and
[20:00] you've heard it in in I'm sure many
[20:02] times before Do no harm
[20:05] you know I believe that should be the mo
[20:08] that should be the modus operandi of
[20:11] every Christian that you live by Do no
[20:13] harm
[20:14] when you're dealing with people do no
[20:16] harm you want to harm the devil you want
[20:18] to tear the devil's Kingdom down you
[20:20] want to destroy lies and addictions and
[20:22] chains and bondage that Satan puts
[20:24] people in then aim your gun towards the
[20:26] devil but don't ever let it aim towards
[20:29] your brother or your sister
[20:32] remember Jesus came to Legion and it
[20:35] wasn't Legion was not the man Legion was
[20:38] the name to identify the spirits of the
[20:41] addiction or the spirits of the trouble
[20:42] and so what the devil will get us to do
[20:44] is we'll take a person in our life who's
[20:46] struggling whether they're addicted
[20:48] their demon possessed they're dealing
[20:50] with demon spirits and if the devil
[20:52] could accomplish anything he'll get you
[20:55] to only see Legion
[20:58] and you don't see the man that's Bound
[21:01] By The Spirits because remember he
[21:03] wasn't he was a son of God
[21:05] that had been bound and don't ever let
[21:07] the devil confuse that tell you that
[21:09] they're the same person they're not
[21:12] behind that bondage is a Son of God or a
[21:15] daughter of God
[21:17] and you've always got to see the soul
[21:19] behind the problem always hello
[21:23] everybody here you awake
[21:25] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[21:27] of your mouth but that which is good to
[21:29] use of edifying that it may Minister
[21:30] Grace unto the hearers
[21:33] and grieve not the Holy Spirit
[21:37] whereby you are sealed into the day of
[21:39] Redemption all these things tie together
[21:40] let all somebody say oh
[21:45] let all bitterness
[21:48] and Wrath
[21:50] and anger we just said be angry and sin
[21:53] not
[21:54] let all bitterness and Wrath and anger
[21:58] and clamor and evil speaking that's
[22:02] backbiting tattling grumbling gossiping
[22:06] and evil speaking be put away from you
[22:09] with all
[22:11] malice
[22:13] these are the things that corrupt the
[22:15] Mind these are the things that corrupt
[22:17] the spirit and when we dwell on these
[22:19] things and we allow these things to come
[22:20] into our Channel we can never express
[22:22] Christ in his true nature
[22:25] and be ye
[22:28] Hind
[22:31] remember I preached this taught this
[22:33] last Sunday kindness is an attribute of
[22:36] a Christian
[22:37] rudeness is not the attribute of a
[22:40] Christian
[22:41] to be rude is not expressing the nature
[22:44] of Christ
[22:45] but rather be kind
[22:48] be ye kind that kind of bar you know
[22:51] those kind bars they're biblical
[22:53] you should eat more of them
[22:55] and be Ye Ye kind
[22:58] one to another
[23:01] tenderhearted we can we're going to take
[23:03] more time on coming Sundays to teach
[23:05] this be a kind tenderhearted forgiving
[23:09] one another that means
[23:12] that your brother and your sister is
[23:13] going to do things
[23:16] where you're going to have to forgive
[23:19] yeah right or else was why would he say
[23:21] forgive one another if he didn't know
[23:22] that we're going to step on each other
[23:24] we're going to step on each other's pain
[23:27] we're going to step on each other's
[23:28] complex in a body of believers
[23:31] now what the devil would like to do is
[23:33] he would like to take those pains and
[23:35] those when someone hurts your feelings
[23:37] or that you don't like what the preacher
[23:39] said or you think he's preaching against
[23:40] you you think nobody loves you he'd love
[23:42] to take you and to separate you and put
[23:45] you over isolated on an island and then
[23:48] give you streaming
[23:49] of course he's not going to cut you
[23:52] totally off he'll put you on an island
[23:54] give you a monitor a TV in the internet
[23:55] and say here just have streamed Church
[24:01] and what can I get away from stream
[24:03] church I then I don't have to have my
[24:05] feelings hurt then nobody can step on me
[24:06] then no one can hurt me then I don't
[24:08] have to be around people and I don't
[24:09] like people I don't want to be around
[24:11] people people just hurt people
[24:14] now you laugh and we Snicker and it's
[24:16] funny but this is the devices of the
[24:18] devil
[24:20] because God intended for you to be in a
[24:23] body
[24:24] where you can get your feelings hurt I
[24:27] said that right God intends for us to be
[24:30] a body where we can step on each other
[24:32] and hurt each other
[24:35] but forgive each other
[24:37] and whereby grow and mature into the
[24:41] statue of a perfect man
[24:45] so if I hurt your feelings forgive me
[24:47] I'm asking for your forgiveness we
[24:49] should we should do that
[24:51] if I hurt you forgive me I'm just a
[24:53] person I'm just a man full of mistakes
[24:55] full of faults and full of failures I
[24:57] don't always say everything right I'm
[24:58] not always right though I might think
[25:00] I'm always right but I'm not
[25:02] and you may say the same exact thing so
[25:05] we he says forgiving one another even as
[25:07] God for Christ's sake of hath forgiven
[25:10] you
[25:12] let's read what the prophet says before
[25:13] we close we just end on some of these if
[25:15] I only read these quotes today then this
[25:19] would be a success I'd really wanted to
[25:21] get to these uh quotations just before
[25:23] we close now another thing
[25:26] that has taken place this is an enticing
[25:29] Spirits uh
[25:30] uh just this is let me go
[25:34] let me go we dealt a lot with brother
[25:35] Brandon preaching about Discord and he
[25:38] said I've never I've never tried to
[25:40] separate or sow Discord among Brethren
[25:42] you were to relate just to recap he'd
[25:45] relate how he would go into special
[25:46] meetings where there was lots of
[25:48] churches and he would use these words
[25:49] they've been taught in their own sphere
[25:51] of belief and he says now in those
[25:53] meetings why not not at my local church
[25:56] he says but when I go into to meetings
[25:58] where I have people from everywhere
[26:01] and he says I never Veer off into things
[26:04] that might so Discord I stick with the
[26:07] fundamentals everything we can all agree
[26:09] upon
[26:10] why
[26:12] because he was a gentleman full of the
[26:13] Holy Spirit
[26:16] and he cared about people
[26:18] and he loved people
[26:20] because Jesus cares about people and he
[26:24] loves people his family his children
[26:28] right
[26:30] and he says the gentleman notice the
[26:32] very last part in bold a gentleman
[26:34] wouldn't do that let alone a Christian
[26:36] certainly not
[26:38] we read this in Proverbs 6 about how the
[26:41] things that the Lord hates is he that
[26:43] soweth Discord is one of those we write
[26:45] about second Timothy the attributes of a
[26:48] true servant of the Lord must not strive
[26:50] means he can't quarrel he's not going to
[26:52] argue he's not going to fuss he's got to
[26:54] be General apt to teach patient and
[26:58] meekness instructing those that oppose
[27:00] himself
[27:01] it's true saying if a man desire office
[27:03] of a bishop he desire a good work go on
[27:05] to the very verse three not given to
[27:07] Wine no Striker
[27:08] not greedy a filthy looker but patient
[27:11] not a brawler not Covetous Titus Bishop
[27:14] must be blameless as the steward of God
[27:16] not self-willed not soon angry
[27:18] not given to Wine no Striker there it is
[27:21] again not given to Filthy looker this is
[27:25] in conferences as long as Satan can keep
[27:27] you firing at one another he just sits
[27:30] back and said brother I don't even have
[27:31] to fight
[27:35] as long as Satan can get us fighting one
[27:37] another inward fighting then he says
[27:40] I'll put my gun down I don't even need
[27:41] to fight they're shooting each other
[27:43] this is god making his promise and you
[27:46] wonder what's happened to you that's
[27:47] what's happened you change your nature
[27:49] you become a woof or a goat instead of a
[27:53] lamb and that's what's a matter with the
[27:55] Pentecostal church today it's snorting
[27:58] and puffing and enough temper to fight a
[28:02] buzz Saul and then wonder what went with
[28:05] the Holy Ghost
[28:07] backbitings fightings and everything
[28:09] else amongst the Christian church and
[28:12] wonder where went the Holy Ghost
[28:16] I I I'll just ask you a very direct
[28:18] question how many would raise a hand and
[28:21] say I want the holy ghost in my home
[28:28] so that Holy Ghost is a nature I'll
[28:31] raise my hand too
[28:32] the Holy Ghost is a nature it's the
[28:34] nature of the Lamb it's the nature of
[28:36] the dove and brother random says you
[28:39] wonder where the Holy Ghost went when
[28:41] there's temper and anger in the home
[28:46] and backbiting and arguing and fussing
[28:49] and then we want the Holy Ghost I say
[28:51] Lord help us
[28:55] he says in fightings everything else
[28:57] amongst the Christian church
[29:01] and wonder where went the Holy Ghost the
[29:03] holy spirit will not abide on such a
[29:05] thing that's right it can't do it if the
[29:07] lamb he says if that if that lamb would
[29:10] have made one snort Like the Wolf away
[29:13] would have went the Dove and today why
[29:16] we just do everything we go everywhere
[29:18] act like the world tell dirty jokes and
[29:21] everything else and smoke and drink are
[29:23] Deacon boards even our pastors dance and
[29:26] carry on and then expect the Holy Spirit
[29:28] to dwell in such a place like that never
[29:32] now a lot of people love to read this
[29:34] quote and go see there see that's the
[29:36] real attribute that's the attributes of
[29:37] the of the Holy Ghost you don't drink
[29:39] you don't smoke you don't tell dirty
[29:41] jokes
[29:42] well let's let's that's right but can
[29:44] you read the rest of the quote not only
[29:47] that but you fuss and fight and bat and
[29:50] stew and argue against I'm Oneness and
[29:53] I'm trinitarian and you ain't got
[29:55] nothing you haven't got you haven't
[29:57] either as long as you act like that I
[29:59] belong to the assemblies I belong to
[30:01] this and I belong to that I go to this
[30:03] brother's church and this is my pastor
[30:05] over here
[30:09] I belong to this I belong to that why
[30:12] don't you belong to Christ
[30:15] you draw now just a minute ago he was
[30:17] speaking about the nature of the lamb
[30:19] and the Dove and the Wolf and snorting
[30:21] and he was saying what is that snorting
[30:23] like that woof he says all the smoking
[30:25] and you're drinking and you're and all
[30:27] of those things go now he's saying and
[30:29] also
[30:31] you draw a little denominational
[30:32] barriers and separate Fellowship
[30:35] separate the Brotherhood and then wonder
[30:38] why you don't have Miracles and things
[30:40] happening in your church wonder why
[30:42] every time I read that I just go wonder
[30:44] why there's no miracles in my life
[30:49] wonder why there's no miraculous in my
[30:51] home and I'm praying for it
[30:54] wonder why you don't have Miracles and
[30:56] things happening and The Miracle Worker
[30:58] has gone
[30:59] that's right no wonder you can't believe
[31:01] in the Divine work and of the Holy
[31:03] Spirit it isn't with you no more if
[31:05] somebody would come to me
[31:07] something contrary I would kind of
[31:10] misunderstand it myself I wouldn't want
[31:12] to criticize what anyone says we're not
[31:15] to criticize each other I'm not guilty
[31:18] of doing that I thank the Lord I notice
[31:21] here's here's an important distinction
[31:22] because was brother random just a
[31:24] jellyfish brother Matt you're just
[31:25] preaching this Gospel of inclusion and
[31:27] you just include everybody
[31:29] was brother Brandon inclusive did he
[31:31] just include everybody and didn't matter
[31:32] how you dressed didn't matter how you
[31:34] look didn't matter how you lived he
[31:36] compromised on Trinity did he compromise
[31:38] on the Trinity if you believe that you
[31:39] don't believe the message
[31:41] but so somehow he was able to have
[31:44] disagreements he was able to stand for
[31:46] the word he was able to be
[31:48] uncompromising he was able to hold a
[31:50] two-edges uh his hand on a two-edged
[31:52] sword but keep the right attitude and
[31:54] spirit and never Target people but
[31:57] Target spirits
[31:59] and he says I'm not guilty of doing that
[32:01] I have criticized sin and unbelief but
[32:04] no individual person see I don't we are
[32:07] brothers and sisters striving how many
[32:10] are striving we are coming down to where
[32:12] sister Florence came yesterday morning
[32:14] she we all got to come that way and it's
[32:17] not my purpose to try to criticize a
[32:19] brother or sister that wouldn't agree
[32:21] with you far be it for me to do that I
[32:24] don't think you'll ever find a tape that
[32:26] I ever caught anybody's name on which I
[32:29] have felt that many times the person was
[32:31] wrong but that's between them and God
[32:33] but what is wrong in the way of sin and
[32:37] misunderstanding sometimes so brother
[32:39] Adam's trying to make a distinction here
[32:40] I have criticized sin and the spirits
[32:43] that but that destroy and bind people
[32:46] cold cold Spirits formal Spirits brother
[32:49] Brandon preached against coldness
[32:50] formality lukewarmness
[32:53] but he did it in a way to build up and
[32:55] not tear anyone down he was tearing the
[32:58] devil's King
