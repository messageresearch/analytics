[36:30] had been praying that Lord you know if

[36:53] go to the to play basketball she could
[36:55] shoot 100 out of 100 at the free throw
[36:57] line that's a feat not even Pros can do

[39:09] amen isn't that the truth he makes life
[39:12] worth living
[39:14] God bless you Saints if we just go ahead

[39:41] I'm I used to be used to the hot weather
[39:43] and everything but um you can probably
[39:45] tell I've got a
[39:48] you can probably tell I got a Southern
[39:50] accent so we're just right at home this
[39:51] morning
[39:52] and uh we certainly bring greetings from
[39:55] from Georgia from a little church there
[39:57] and uh just above Atlanta from Lula
[39:59] Georgia brother Samuel Dell has been
[40:01] pastoring for since since uh I think
[40:03] 1975 so he's been holding the faith for
[40:07] a long time and certainly been great
[40:08] greedies from from the whole church and
[40:11] uh like our brother said I am Esther and
[40:14] Zach's dad so I was so glad to have my
[40:17] family here with us today and and uh
[40:20] that'll make it that'll make it easier
[40:22] to preach this morning to have my my
[40:24] children looking at me
[40:26] um I want to take advantage of Father's
[40:28] Day this morning you know sometimes when
[40:30] I preach I don't really gear the the
[40:32] sermon necessarily toward the holiday
[40:34] um but today I want to I want to talk
[40:36] about my heavenly father so let's uh uh
[40:39] let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[40:41] before we read the scripture and Lord
[40:42] God we're so grateful to be able to
[40:44] gather it around here today gather
[40:46] around your word Lord Jesus and Lord as
[40:48] we know this morning your people have
[40:50] some have driven for a long way and
[40:52] we've all gathered here today not to
[40:54] look at one another and not to see the
[40:55] minister not to see Lord anybody in
[40:58] particular Lord but we're come to see
[40:59] you Lord Jesus and Lord does he look
[41:01] into your word I ask Lord that you'll
[41:03] just open up the scriptures to us so
[41:05] that we can open to open up our eyes of
[41:06] Faith so that we can see you Lord and
[41:08] Lord we might have Elders this morning

[41:15] the young people who are needing
[41:16] Direction in your life Lord and all the
[41:18] different needs Lord that we have Lord I

[41:31] and sweep down the owl o God and Quicken
[41:33] the word of your people we ask this
[41:35] blessing in your name amen
[41:37] now Genesis chapter 15 verse 12 to 14 uh
[41:42] we'll kind of talk about a promise and
[41:45] and then go to Exodus 14. Genesis 15 12
[41:48] reads like this and when the sun was
[41:50] going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram
[41:52] and lo and horror of great Darkness fell
[41:55] upon him and he said unto Abram know of
[41:58] a surety that thy seed shall be a
[41:59] stranger in a land that is not theirs
[42:01] and Shall Serve them and shall afflict
[42:03] them 400 years and also that Nation whom
[42:07] they serve will I judge and afterwards
[42:09] shall they come out with great substance
[42:11] my what a promise and over there in
[42:13] Exodus chapter 14 if we kind of flip
[42:16] over a chapter and read from verse 13.
[42:18] I'll give you just a moment to flip the
[42:22] pages and in verse 13 it says and
[42:26] I'll be patient a little longer I'm
[42:28] ready to go
[42:32] in verse 13 it says and Moses said unto
[42:34] the people fear ye not stand still and
[42:37] see the salvation of the Lord which he
[42:40] will show to you today
[42:42] for the Egyptians whom you have seen
[42:44] today ye shall see them again no more
[42:46] forever the Lord shall fight for you and
[42:49] ye shall hold your peace and the Lord
[42:51] said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou
[42:53] unto me speak unto the children of
[42:55] Israel that they go forward but lift out
[42:58] thy rod and stretch out thine hand over
[43:00] the sea and divide it and the children
[43:02] of Israel shall go on dry ground through
[43:03] the midst of the sea you may be seated
[43:06] the Lord at his Blessing to the reading
[43:08] the word I I I I I want to just kind of
[43:11] remind us as we were just read in
[43:13] Genesis chapter 15 that that God
[43:15] promised Abraham that his children were
[43:17] going to be uh sojourners down in the
[43:19] wilderness for 400 uh sojourners in
[43:21] Egypt for 400 years and he gave them my
[43:23] promise to bring them out and Moses got
[43:26] to that place there where he was
[43:27] standing at the Red Sea and he began to
[43:29] cry out to God in the time of trouble
[43:31] that and brother Brown said and God
[43:32] rebuked Moses back right when trouble
[43:34] was in session and it's just nature
[43:37] seeming like for a person to cry out and
[43:39] then water rebuke it is for God to turn
[43:41] around and rebuke him for saying it for
[43:43] crying out to him it looks like it's a
[43:45] very hard thing you know because God
[43:47] wants us to believe and when we get
[43:49] sometimes we'll get into a situation in
[43:51] life where it looks like he can't go
[43:52] back and can't go forward and looks like
[43:54] a real tough spot and God LED Moses
[43:57] right into that place where he he began
[43:59] to God at Moses began to question the
[44:01] purpose of God and you know you read
[44:03] about it in Hebrews chapter 11 where
[44:05] where Paul told us that without faith
[44:07] you can't even please God God wants
[44:10] somebody to trust him so now I want to
[44:12] think today that on this Father's Day on
[44:15] this Father's Day every every good
[44:16] father wants his children to trust him
[44:18] to believe to believe his word to have
[44:21] confidence in him and you know that's
[44:22] what any good father wants he wants to
[44:24] be it when he says something he wants
[44:26] his children to believe him to have
[44:27] confidence that that the word that he
[44:29] says is true that that he's going to
[44:31] stand behind every how can you even how
[44:33] can you have trust in any man if he's
[44:35] not going to back up the things that he
[44:36] says and so that's what I want to say
[44:38] this morning that I believe that we have
[44:40] a God that we've got a father that we
[44:42] can trust when he says anything he's
[44:44] going to back up his word he doesn't
[44:46] just say something to just to say
[44:48] something vain say something that where
[44:50] these words are going to fall to the
[44:51] ground but he's going to back up his
[44:53] promises I I got to looking online just
[44:56] to kind of see an example you know in
[44:58] the Civil War they come up with this uh
[45:00] this term called a deadbeat a deadbeat
[45:02] is somebody that they're just so
[45:03] deadbeat they're just laying laying
[45:05] there and good for nothing and they and
[45:07] they won't uh that they won't get up and
[45:08] get job or anything and you start
[45:10] thinking about what a deadbeat dad is I
[45:13] I looked online to see what a definition
[45:15] of what a deadbeat dad would be and the
[45:17] number one definition of a deadbeat dad
[45:19] is somebody that won't fulfill their
[45:21] promises they make a promise and they
[45:23] won't stand behind it and you know like
[45:25] maybe maybe the father if you look
[45:27] through your go back through your life
[45:28] and think about maybe as many examples
[45:31] that you come across and a deadbeat dad
[45:33] was somebody that will say well I'm
[45:35] never going to leave you and then they
[45:36] don't show up they're they're gone
[45:38] somewhere they'll promise their their
[45:39] spouse well I'm going to stand behind
[45:41] you through thick or thin as soon as
[45:43] something bad comes along then they they
[45:45] turn up missing but you know they maybe
[45:47] they'll say I'll always be there for you
[45:49] for their children they'll say I'm going
[45:51] to be there for your ball game I'm going
[45:53] to show up I'm gonna I'm gonna be there
[45:54] for you but they won't they make all
[45:56] these empty promises or they'll say
[45:58] maybe I'll I'll never forsake you I'm
[46:00] I'm gonna always be on your side I'll be
[46:03] your comfort because you know that's
[46:05] what a father is supposed to be a
[46:07] father's supposed to be somebody that
[46:08] you can turn to and when things get by
[46:10] at a comforting time a problem somebody
[46:12] that you can run to and get some advice
[46:14] and get some counsel but you see this
[46:16] morning I don't believe that we're
[46:17] serving a deadbeat dead I don't believe
[46:19] that we're serving a father that backs
[46:22] down from his promises I believe that
[46:24] we've got somebody that when when we
[46:26] need somebody to talk to we can in the
[46:28] dead of night when everything's going
[46:30] wrong if you don't know which way to
[46:32] turn and you begin to cry out and you
[46:34] don't even know how to pray you've got
[46:35] somebody that can answer back I thank
[46:38] God for God like that thank God that we
[46:41] serve a God who is not a deadbeat dad
[46:43] and this morning I think it I think it's
[46:45] such a privilege to be able to talk
[46:47] about my heavenly father to be able to
[46:49] talk about the God that I serve them
[46:51] we're not just coming to church to feel
[46:53] a church pew that we're not just coming
[46:55] to church just to look at one another
[46:56] but we have a God that we can serve who
[46:59] will back up his word
[47:00] oh oh you think about that you're real a
[47:03] real father is there from the very
[47:04] beginning the the in Romans chapter 8 it
[47:07] says for many as they're led by the
[47:08] spirit of God they are sons of God for
[47:10] you have not received the spirit of
[47:12] bondage again to fear but you ever see
[47:13] the spirit of adoption whereby we cry
[47:16] I'm a father and you know you you think
[47:18] when you first when you come first come
[47:20] forth from the Matrix now I'm talking
[47:22] spiritual now not natural but the first
[47:24] thing you start looking for is your
[47:26] daddy you come forth crying for your
[47:28] father you want to see your father and
[47:30] the first thing you see is your father's
[47:32] face because he reveals himself to you
[47:34] and you begin to come into relationship
[47:36] with him you begin to know who your God
[47:38] is and who your daddy is I thank God for
[47:41] a gospel that will take us to a
[47:43] relationship with God not just the
[47:45] relationship with man or the letters on
[47:47] the page but love relationship with the
[47:49] living reality of who God is I started
[47:52] looking online to all these examples of
[47:54] what a real father is and this there's
[47:56] this website online called the
[47:57] fatherhood commission and they say that
[47:59] there's seven roles of a father that a
[48:01] father's got to be a provider I provide
[48:04] a father is going to be a protector a
[48:07] father is going to be a leader a father
[48:09] is going to be a teacher a father is
[48:11] going to be a helper a father is going
[48:14] to be an encourager and a father is
[48:16] going to be a friend oh I thank God that
[48:18] we've got a father who fulfills all
[48:20] those roles and when we look into the
[48:22] word we see the promises of all those
[48:24] roles that we can cling to in time of
[48:27] need and time of trouble that he's a
[48:29] provider because Philippians says that
[48:31] my God shall supply all your need
[48:33] according to his riches and Glory by
[48:35] Christ Jesus Oh I thank God that we've
[48:37] got that kind of a promise that we can
[48:38] lean on that we can turn to in time of
[48:40] trouble that when you when you can't pay
[48:42] the bills and when things begin to go
[48:44] wrong then you got somebody you got a
[48:46] scripture that you can lay in front of
[48:48] him and say God you promised it you're
[48:50] the one that said I thank God this
[48:52] morning that we're not we're not leaning
[48:54] upon the words of a man we're not
[48:56] leaning upon the words of some man
[48:58] that's a man's theological idea but
[49:00] we're leaning on the words that came
[49:02] straight from the Throne of Grace he's
[49:05] our protector because the Bible says in
[49:07] Psalms 121 The Lord Is Thy keeper the
[49:10] Lord is thou shade upon thy right hand
[49:12] the son shall not smite thee by day nor
[49:14] the mood By Night the Lord shall
[49:16] preserve thee from all evil he's my
[49:18] helper because it says God is our refuge
[49:21] and strength a very present help in time
[49:23] of trouble
[49:24] now brother Brandon said they didn't
[49:26] judge Jehovah Jireh he said as long as
[49:28] you have the promise of God that says it
[49:30] regardless of what circumstances looked
[49:32] like believe it anyhow for God said so I
[49:36] think I think that's that's what I'm
[49:37] preaching on this morning that when it
[49:39] beyond all this the circumstance we're
[49:41] we're oh we're not looking at things
[49:42] while they're natural eye but we're
[49:44] looking like Abraham the things that we
[49:46] cannot be seen we're looking to the to
[49:48] another realm for our faith and brother
[49:51] Brandon said if you are the children of
[49:52] Abraham not the children of the church
[49:54] now the children of the denomination but
[49:56] the children of Abraham you believe
[49:59] God's promises every one of them
[50:01] regardless of what someone else would
[50:04] say about it you believe his promises
[50:06] are true I believe that's something that
[50:08] every real child of Abraham should be
[50:10] able to do is to look look straight in
[50:13] the face of God's promises and say I
[50:15] believe it I believe it because you said
[50:17] it if God said it I believe it and that
[50:20] settles it I believe it I want to think
[50:23] now in Hebrews chapter 6 that Paul told
[50:25] us that God willingly more abundantly to
[50:28] show under the air as it promised the
[50:29] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[50:31] by an oath that God the god that cannot
[50:34] lie wanted us to believe his word so
[50:36] much that he come behind it and swore an
[50:39] oath on top of that the god oh to think
[50:41] about that this morning that the god
[50:42] that cannot lie a God that cannot say
[50:45] something is false swore an oath on top
[50:47] of it so that you will know that the
[50:49] Seed of Abraham will possess the Gate of
[50:50] your enemies so that you know that you
[50:53] will be a blessing God Abraham's seed
[50:55] will be a blessing everywhere throughout
[50:56] all the world in your church at your
[50:58] work that you will be a blessing all
[51:01] these promises that we have access to
[51:03] that in Matthew chapter 4 24 he said
[51:05] Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my
[51:07] word shall not pass away that when God
[51:09] said it you can hang everything on it he
[51:12] said I'll be a father unto you and he
[51:14] shall be my sons and daughters he said
[51:16] life is a father pityth his children so
[51:18] the Lord pityth him that fear Him oh a
[51:21] father is good oh that's what makes a
[51:23] father good is when he keeps his
[51:25] promises
[51:26] that's what that was that's what makes a
[51:28] father good is when he keeps his
[51:30] promises when he keeps his word and our
[51:32] father does not forget his promises our
[51:35] father is going to back up every word
[51:37] that he said everything that he promised
[51:39] everything everything that he said
[51:40] because he is a good god and a good god
[51:43] a good father keeps his word and wisdom
[51:46] versus Faith he said he is a good god
[51:48] and the only way I can trust him to be a
[51:50] good God that he will stay with his word
[51:52] how can you expect me to be truthful
[51:54] when I'm not truthful if you tell one
[51:57] thing do something else my word is
[51:59] pretty shaky though what makes him a
[52:01] good God is because he spoke the word
[52:03] and we're to live by that word
[52:07] oh now in the story of of why Christ
[52:09] Christ speaking God God gives us life
[52:12] experiences a lot of times that we can
[52:13] look back on look back on to build our
[52:16] faith to build our faith to a place
[52:17] where we get into a situation like Moses
[52:19] was there on the on on the shore of that
[52:22] red sea he's got all these experiences
[52:24] back in him up that he can look back to
[52:25] and say I I remember I remember when you
[52:28] were here were there for me in this case
[52:30] and I remember when you were there for
[52:32] me in this case and it all builds up
[52:34] what's God is building and building our
[52:36] total and complete trust in him so that
[52:38] we oh what's he doing he's building up
[52:40] our faith until we can believe for the
[52:42] impossible God wants us to believe for
[52:45] the impossible it doesn't matter what
[52:48] the situation is that God wants us to
[52:49] believe it because he promised it I
[52:52] believe in a god that is a god of
[52:54] circumstance he's a god of no matter
[52:56] what the circumstance is no matter what
[52:58] the situation is if your children ever
[53:00] left home if your wife or your spouse
[53:02] have left home if things are going wrong
[53:04] it'll work I believe in a God that can
[53:06] fix things I believe oh I believe in a
[53:09] miracle working God I still believe in
[53:10] that God that can change things you know
[53:13] you go back and listen to the message
[53:14] Paradox and he said that you are you are
[53:17] a miracle that's why you can believe in
[53:19] miracles because you are a miracle and
[53:21] God changed your life and you can look
[53:23] back and remember how God got a hold of
[53:25] your life and change you and you ain't
[53:27] the way that you used to be and that
[53:29] kind of a person you can look at the
[53:30] situation and say I know that God is
[53:32] still a miracle working God he caused a
[53:35] miracle in my life and I ate the same
[53:37] and I I've Been Changed oh that's what
[53:39] we're looking for when we come to church
[53:41] we're looking for change and I I believe
[53:43] in a God that can change things I
[53:45] believe when things get bad that God can
[53:47] make it good I believe when you get down
[53:49] in the valley that God can lift you up
[53:52] oh remember remember church I think it
[53:55] tastes good sometimes to rehearse our
[53:57] experiences to go to go back and look
[54:00] and it's good to testify and to rehearse
[54:02] you remember when they came when they
[54:04] finally come over the Red Sea they came
[54:05] over to the promised land
[54:07] they erected those 12 Stones and they
[54:09] you know oh you think about how the
[54:11] children of Israel as their children got
[54:13] older they could take them back to those
[54:14] 12 Stones and as they got older and the
[54:16] years went by they could keep going back
[54:18] to those stones and say I remember I
[54:20] remember my maybe my grandparents or
[54:22] whoever crossed across the Red Sea they
[54:24] were there I remember when they come
[54:26] across I remember when they went through
[54:28] these experiences and well how did they
[54:30] come across they were following the word
[54:31] that was carried on the backs of the of
[54:34] the priest I remember all you think oh
[54:37] you think all the things that we can
[54:38] look back on in our own lives they
[54:40] should build our faith to remember
[54:42] remember when God sent a prophet maybe
[54:44] some of the older ones sitting here were
[54:46] sitting in the in the campaign meetings
[54:47] when brother and I spoke and maybe you
[54:49] didn't understand what he was speaking
[54:51] it begin to God began to deal with you
[54:53] and you begin to realize that it was
[54:54] this was just more than just a healing
[54:56] campaign that there was a message coming
[54:58] forth and maybe then he he passed away
[55:00] and people began to be in turmoil all
[55:02] remember this morning church remember
[55:04] when people Begin to Fall Away Back in
[55:06] 1970 seven because he didn't understand
[55:08] things but God was God he said that he
[55:11] promised that he would the spirit of
[55:13] Truth would lead guide you into all
[55:15] truth and you kept hanging on you kept
[55:17] hanging on with the word oh won't you
[55:19] remember how God give you the Holy Ghost
[55:21] and God kept dealing with you oh and you
[55:24] maybe you had a problem in the dead of
[55:25] night and your wife had a problem and
[55:27] you laid your hands over honor and God
[55:29] came on the scene and touched her oh
[55:31] these are things to remember this is
[55:33] what those stones that were resurrected
[55:35] on their said to the Red Sea were for to
[55:37] remember remember what God did for you
[55:40] oh you'd have to agree this morning that
[55:42] Moses Moses was born into a family that
[55:45] trusted and believed God and this gave
[55:47] Moses when he was standing there on the
[55:49] Red Sea it gave him a lot of things to
[55:51] look back on and remember it was a time
[55:54] of for a deliverer and his his mother
[55:56] and father they began to pray exactly
[55:58] according to the scripture oh I'm
[56:00] telling you these things because these
[56:01] are things that Moses could look back on
[56:03] and remember because Jacobin told him
[56:06] later she she would relay these things
[56:08] to him oh I remember I remember how we
[56:10] were praying for a deliverer I remember
[56:12] it was time we knew it was time to come
[56:15] out how did they know it was time to
[56:16] come out because they could look back
[56:18] into the word of a prophet and when you
[56:20] look back into the word of a prophet
[56:21] what the prophet said you can know that
[56:23] it's time to go free oh when you read
[56:25] the word you can know that you could
[56:27] come out of whatever your situation is
[56:29] if you've got depression this morning if
[56:31] you've got a problem in your life
[56:32] there's a promise laying here in the
[56:34] scripture that you could come out you
[56:35] don't have to stay in the situation that
[56:37] you're in why because God promised and
[56:41] we've got confidence in our father that
[56:43] he's not a deadbeat God a deadbeat dad a
[56:46] father that won't back up his promises
[56:48] oh you think about amram and Jacob
[56:50] better begin to pray their prayers were
[56:51] exactly with the scripture their prayers
[56:54] was with the promised word brother
[56:55] Raymond said oh well how could they
[56:57] listen church I believe I believe that
[56:59] if you I believe what the Bible says
[57:01] that I you have not because you ask not
[57:03] and many times we many times what do we
[57:06] do we fail to realize that God's
[57:08] promises are true we begin to kind of
[57:10] rationalize it in our mind well it was
[57:12] for that person over there but I don't
[57:14] know my situations may be different my
[57:16] situations oh I believe church this
[57:19] morning and a God who who you can you
[57:21] can hang everything on he's a god of
[57:24] unbroken promises he's a God that will
[57:27] back up his word and I believe that
[57:29] prayer still changes things I believe
[57:32] that when you come in faith asking God
[57:34] and laying before him the word that he's
[57:36] already spoken something is going to
[57:38] happen I believe in my I take 25 years
[57:41] it might take a hundred years like Noah
[57:43] it might take a long time but God is
[57:45] going to do something why because he
[57:48] backs up his word he is a god of
[57:50] promises
[57:52] oh you're thinking of the hour of death
[57:54] they fed their children to feed and
[57:56] chill all they were feeding the children
[57:57] of the crocodiles and amram and Joker
[57:59] bed didn't they weren't afraid of
[58:01] Pharaoh's command to kill the children
[58:03] and what they do they turned Moses over
[58:05] to God all you see we've got that
[58:07] promise that if you you've got maybe a
[58:09] child that you don't know what to do
[58:10] with if I'll just turn him over to God
[58:12] God knows how to do with deal with
[58:14] things in this situation God as many
[58:16] times we know we'll get our hands all
[58:18] over the situation and we're just mess
[58:20] it up when we get our hands but if we'll
[58:21] back up and just let God do it and say
[58:23] God I know this you're a God that you
[58:26] promised us that if we'll cast all our
[58:28] care upon you he he cares for us you
[58:31] promised us that if we'll take if we'll
[58:33] take if we'll just get yoked up with you
[58:35] like two oxen we get yoked up with him
[58:38] then he'll carry our burdens and he'll
[58:40] carry us through
[58:41] and brother Adam said he had been taught
[58:43] he had been taught by his mama that he
[58:45] was going to be the deliverer and his
[58:46] mama maybe told him and said Moses when
[58:48] you were a little baby your father amram
[58:50] when he was working in the brick key on
[58:52] he'd pray every night all night long
[58:54] God's sin to deliver oh I I wonder if
[58:58] you ever heard this quote he said one
[58:59] night in a vision upstairs he's seen a
[59:02] great angel stand with a sword and
[59:04] pointing North and said I'm ready to
[59:06] take the people out and I conceived you
[59:08] Moses right under the threat of pharaoh
[59:10] and I hid you in the bull rush and right
[59:12] amongst the Gators that was fat upon the
[59:15] babies of Egypt but God delivered you
[59:18] and you were a proper child when you
[59:20] were born you were born to be a prophet
[59:22] Moses you are God's servant oh my I
[59:26] thank God for a positive message this
[59:28] morning oh you think about joche bed
[59:30] he's right there in the middle of all
[59:31] the Egyptians and she's just she said
[59:33] she ain't telling him that he's stupid
[59:35] and worthless she ain't beating him down
[59:37] and telling him he ain't nothing but
[59:38] she's speaking Apostles she's got a
[59:40] positive message for him and this
[59:42] morning I I believe I've got a positive
[59:44] message for the bride of Christ I
[59:46] believe that if we can confess our
[59:48] father's promises it's a positive
[59:50] promise that we're confessing I'm glad
[59:53] for a gospel this morning that doesn't
[59:54] beat us down and put us back in bondage
[59:56] but a gospel that lift us out of the
[59:59] situation that are in the middle take us
[1:00:00] out it'll it'll give us Deliverance I'm
[1:00:03] reminded this morning when Jesus Took
[1:00:05] The Scroll of Isaiah there in the 10
[1:00:07] people and he unfolded and began to
[1:00:09] identify himself in the scripture he
[1:00:11] began to read that that this he was sent
[1:00:13] to preach the Liberty the captives to
[1:00:15] open doors to them that are bound and I
[1:00:17] I I think this morning also if you know
[1:00:20] Peter and John they're on the uh at the
[1:00:22] gate beautiful and they begin to
[1:00:23] preacher they began to talk to that man
[1:00:26] laying a firm on the side of the road
[1:00:27] and they began to tell him they began to
[1:00:30] tell him we don't have any money we
[1:00:32] don't have any silver and gold but such
[1:00:34] as I have I give unto you and I believe
[1:00:36] we can have that same confession this
[1:00:38] morning that we don't have popularity or
[1:00:39] we don't have money or programs or soup
[1:00:42] suppers and all those those things but I
[1:00:44] I believe we've got something this
[1:00:45] morning to preach that'll do the same
[1:00:47] thing today that it did 2 000 years ago
[1:00:50] we've got something to give Liberty to
[1:00:52] the captive to the Liberty to those that
[1:00:53] are bound that'll break the prison
[1:00:55] change and break the doors off of your
[1:00:57] captivity you know something there's
[1:00:58] something that'll get you out just like
[1:01:00] it got Peter out when he was bound there
[1:01:02] in the prison oh you think jochebed
[1:01:04] could speak words or promise words are
[1:01:07] promise words that you've got value
[1:01:09] Moses oh Moses had value all right and I
[1:01:13] wanted to clear to you this morning that
[1:01:14] you've got value too oh you remember
[1:01:16] brother Ryan preached that sermon he
[1:01:18] cares he cares do you care Oh The Gospel
[1:01:21] message that he cares about your
[1:01:23] situation no matter what your situation
[1:01:25] is this morning God cares about oh to
[1:01:27] think this morning that brother Brown
[1:01:29] said that your soul is worth ten
[1:01:31] thousand worlds to God oh you know it
[1:01:34] ought to think about that this morning I
[1:01:35] I think it would be a great thing to say
[1:01:37] that my soul was worth One World then my
[1:01:40] soul would be worth one worth or that my
[1:01:42] soul would be what would work be worth
[1:01:44] one solar system but to think this
[1:01:46] morning that your soul is worth ten
[1:01:48] thousand of these hours still we're
[1:01:50] standing on that's what kind of value
[1:01:52] that you have to God also this morning
[1:01:55] maybe if the devil's got you beat down
[1:01:56] and thinking that God don't care about
[1:01:58] you anymore well I've got news for you
[1:02:00] God still cares and maybe you're old and
[1:02:02] maybe you're getting weak in your body
[1:02:04] and you begin to think that nobody cares
[1:02:06] and your children don't call home but
[1:02:08] God still cares maybe maybe a young
[1:02:10] person and you think that your parents
[1:02:12] don't understand you and the bullies at
[1:02:14] school and understand you nobody cares
[1:02:16] about you but God still cares I think
[1:02:18] that was the message that jacobed was
[1:02:20] telling to Moses when he was a little
[1:02:21] child that God cares about you and you
[1:02:24] got value oh what a great thing that is
[1:02:26] this morning that your father in Heaven
[1:02:28] thinks that you've got value God wants
[1:02:30] to do something with your life God wants
[1:02:33] to take your life and do something with
[1:02:34] you God has raised you up for a purpose
[1:02:37] giacombe would tell Moses God has a plan
[1:02:39] for you God is going to use you
[1:02:42] oh to think about this morning think
[1:02:44] about what your plan is Paul told us in
[1:02:47] Romans Romans what I plan God's plan for
[1:02:49] us is for whom he did for no he also did
[1:02:52] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:02:54] image of his son that he might be the
[1:02:56] firstborn among many brethren oh to
[1:02:59] think about that this morning that God
[1:03:00] predestinated through that purpose to be
[1:03:02] conformed into the image of a holy God
[1:03:04] to live a holy life oh what does that
[1:03:07] mean this for us this morning friends
[1:03:08] that means that you can walk just like
[1:03:10] Jesus did that you can talk just like
[1:03:12] Jesus did that he'll transform transform
[1:03:14] your mind so that you think like Jesus
[1:03:16] did transform your mind what so that you
[1:03:19] don't think the impossible was do you
[1:03:21] begin to think that they're possible
[1:03:22] impossible is possible you begin to
[1:03:25] think that all those things that the the
[1:03:26] world maybe a lot of other other
[1:03:27] preachers and so forth have told you
[1:03:29] it's been possible but yet oh you looked
[1:03:32] right to the word of God and it tells
[1:03:34] you that things are impossible or
[1:03:35] impossible that God will back up his
[1:03:38] word and his word that he's the word is
[1:03:40] preached it ain't gonna just fall to the
[1:03:41] ground and not accomplish this purpose
[1:03:43] all to think this morning church that
[1:03:45] God is looking for some good ground for
[1:03:47] his word to fall in all this to think
[1:03:49] this morning he's looking for somebody
[1:03:51] that'll open up the door of their heart
[1:03:53] and say I believe that and when somebody
[1:03:55] opens up the door or God can do
[1:03:57] something God will do some than with you
[1:03:58] when God when you open up the door and
[1:04:00] say God use me I want to open up every
[1:04:02] door in my heart I want you to be Lord
[1:04:04] of my life I want you to take take me
[1:04:06] over I want you to be I want to be so
[1:04:08] captive to your will until you can do
[1:04:10] something with me oh to think this
[1:04:13] morning if you want to find out that
[1:04:14] God's will for your life if you could
[1:04:16] just go back to the word back to God's
[1:04:18] promises back to what God said about you
[1:04:20] and you'll find out what God wants wants
[1:04:22] for your life oh to think this morning
[1:04:24] I'm reminded of in First Kings chapter
[1:04:26] 13 a prophet just came out of nowhere
[1:04:28] and began to prophesy he he prophecy he
[1:04:30] cried against the altar in the word of
[1:04:32] the Lord and said oh altar thus saith
[1:04:34] the Lord Behold a child shall be born
[1:04:36] into the house of David Josiah by name
[1:04:39] and upon thee shall he offer the priests
[1:04:41] of the high places that burn incidents
[1:04:42] upon thee and men's bone shall be burnt
[1:04:44] upon thee and 350 years later in second
[1:04:48] Kings chapter 22 a little boy named
[1:04:51] Josiah was born and began to be ruling
[1:04:53] at the age of eight years old and oh you
[1:04:56] think about how that young boy must have
[1:04:58] pulled the scripture off of the uh off
[1:05:00] the off the shelves on the wall and
[1:05:02] begin to pour through those those things
[1:05:04] that have been said about him 350 years
[1:05:06] later and was able to identify himself
[1:05:09] in the scripture scripturally where he
[1:05:10] would be scripturally what he would do
[1:05:12] because why is the promises of God that
[1:05:15] give us confidence it's the promises of
[1:05:17] God that build our faith when you can
[1:05:19] look back in the Bible and begin to see
[1:05:21] that all these things that God said
[1:05:23] about David it's really identifying my
[1:05:26] life I've gone through the same Journey
[1:05:28] that David went through I've gone
[1:05:29] through the same Journey that Abraham
[1:05:31] went through I've gone through this I've
[1:05:32] gone through the same Journey that he
[1:05:34] went through oh thank God this morning
[1:05:36] that was a type of me not the other way
[1:05:38] around round and it was a type of me the
[1:05:41] life that I'm living
[1:05:42] oh to think that this you look into the
[1:05:45] scripture and you'll get oh it'll build
[1:05:47] your confidence that's what I'm talking
[1:05:48] about when you oh coming to church this
[1:05:50] morning is not in vain coming to church
[1:05:52] and just going to church every day every
[1:05:54] Sunday every Wednesday night it's not in
[1:05:56] vain but it's it's accomplishing a
[1:05:58] purpose in your life it's doing
[1:06:00] something in you it's God building up
[1:06:01] his faith when you to where you can
[1:06:03] believe for all things all things are
[1:06:07] possible and in the belief I ought to
[1:06:09] think this morning that that was brother
[1:06:10] Brown's theme song all those years but
[1:06:12] do we really believe it do we really
[1:06:14] believe it or are we like Sarah giggling
[1:06:15] in the tent when when when Jesus when
[1:06:18] God outside the tents given the promise
[1:06:20] do we giggle within ourselves and say
[1:06:22] for me for me is it can it be true for
[1:06:25] me in my situation I want to declare to
[1:06:28] you this morning that it can be true why
[1:06:31] because we've got a father who who will
[1:06:33] back up every promise that he said
[1:06:36] God wants somebody to agree with what
[1:06:38] he's already said
[1:06:40] oh to think about this morning that God
[1:06:42] cares about his people hey you don't
[1:06:44] want him to see in bondage to the devil
[1:06:46] he cared enough this morning to die on
[1:06:48] the cross for yo do you think you know
[1:06:50] sometimes I like to preach on these
[1:06:51] little these little stories that brother
[1:06:53] I'm told that maybe sometimes we just it
[1:06:55] seems like we just hear over and over
[1:06:57] and over again and maybe it loses the
[1:06:59] emphasis like that little story of the
[1:07:01] of the apostle that one day he was he he
[1:07:03] was praying for other people and all of
[1:07:05] a sudden this little pot tore up looking
[1:07:06] little opossum with mamas on his back
[1:07:08] come walking up to the door and lay down
[1:07:10] on the steps and everybody everybody was
[1:07:12] saying well let's just put it down uh
[1:07:14] what I'm getting at is oh you think you
[1:07:16] ain't got no value but if that little
[1:07:18] possum had value to God that brother
[1:07:20] Brown prayed over and God healed that
[1:07:22] thing oh what what kind of value do you
[1:07:25] have sitting here this morning that God
[1:07:27] would tell you what take such care for a
[1:07:29] little possum that he said it was laying
[1:07:31] unconscious green flies all over his
[1:07:33] shoulder broken out laying there
[1:07:35] suffering and dying you think about
[1:07:37] something that everybody just wanted to
[1:07:38] put down isn't that sometimes hell
[1:07:40] people want to just like just give up on
[1:07:41] people in the church just give up on
[1:07:43] somebody that can't live right but God
[1:07:45] sees that are you in your life he said I
[1:07:48] walked out there and said God if you
[1:07:50] were merciful enough to deal with a done
[1:07:51] out dumb animal who was God lady enough
[1:07:54] about it to raise her babies in Jesus
[1:07:56] name I pray all you think about God's
[1:07:58] grace that God cares if God cares for a
[1:08:02] little possum how much more does he care
[1:08:04] about you if God cares about a little
[1:08:06] fishy that laying there with his insides
[1:08:08] turned out and brother Adam would stand
[1:08:10] up in the boat led by the spirit of God
[1:08:11] to say little fishy I'll give you back
[1:08:13] your life if he cares enough about a
[1:08:15] little fishy laying there in the water
[1:08:16] with the bubble bubbles and all the
[1:08:18] slime all around it
[1:08:21] oh brother Bob what are you getting at
[1:08:23] I'm talking about maybe you're in the
[1:08:24] Brick Kiln this morning maybe maybe
[1:08:26] you're on that sheep like job maybe
[1:08:28] maybe you're just in a situation where
[1:08:30] it looks like oh hope is gone but God
[1:08:32] what's God doing he's giving you a
[1:08:34] background he's giving you he's building
[1:08:36] up your face so one day you can look
[1:08:38] back at this situation that you're in
[1:08:40] right now and say you were with me then
[1:08:42] I know that you'll still be with me now
[1:08:44] and why can't we look back at all those
[1:08:46] times that God has brought us all those
[1:08:48] situations you remember this morning
[1:08:50] remember when you had a need and God
[1:08:52] came on the scene remember the little
[1:08:54] things remember when you lost your car
[1:08:56] keys or you lost your wallet or somebody
[1:08:58] stole it from you and God brought it
[1:09:00] back remember those times when God come
[1:09:02] on the scene oh Moses could look back
[1:09:04] Moses could remember brother I'm said in
[1:09:07] that message why Christ speak he said
[1:09:08] all the background just keeps up all the
[1:09:11] background oh you think about your
[1:09:12] background heaping up this is going to
[1:09:14] happen this is going to happen this is
[1:09:16] going to happen then it accumulates
[1:09:18] together and draws a picture for us oh
[1:09:21] draws a picture for us that we can
[1:09:23] believe we can really believe God and
[1:09:25] we've got a God that we can just we can
[1:09:27] just have total confidence in total
[1:09:30] complete confidence in
[1:09:32] man brother I'm in a spiritual food in
[1:09:34] due season he said hold to think about
[1:09:36] this now
[1:09:37] he said I want you to get you built up
[1:09:39] now
[1:09:40] I want to get you built up now in this
[1:09:42] holy Oracles of God in the faith the
[1:09:45] faith of this hour the faith it's going
[1:09:48] to take more faith than ever was in any
[1:09:50] age for this has to be Rapture in faith
[1:09:52] to be taken up and so we want you to
[1:09:55] believe tonight and all that you have
[1:09:56] seen heard the word that you have heard
[1:09:58] preached the signs and wonders that you
[1:10:00] have seen done oh now listen Here's the
[1:10:03] Clincher we want you to accumulate all
[1:10:05] that together in your heart and consider
[1:10:07] it whether if that be God or not oh to
[1:10:10] think this morning that all these things
[1:10:11] as we come to church day week after week
[1:10:14] year after year all the way all the way
[1:10:16] back to the beginning when you were
[1:10:17] first born again all the what's
[1:10:19] happening is you're building up you're
[1:10:20] accumulating your faith the word is
[1:10:23] accumulating you're building up
[1:10:24] something and the power of the devil
[1:10:27] brother I said oh if we could only
[1:10:28] accumulate that kind of Faith tonight
[1:10:30] get that kind of faith and living among
[1:10:32] us mainly moving in our beings moving
[1:10:35] through the church not just the
[1:10:36] emotional Faith but a real Solid Faith
[1:10:39] it won't take no foreign oh that's the
[1:10:41] kind of faith we what we need tonight
[1:10:42] this morning church is the faith that
[1:10:44] will don't take no for an answer to how
[1:10:47] you're going to get that Faith by as you
[1:10:49] accumulate the word as you hear the word
[1:10:51] oh it's building up within you it's
[1:10:53] building up where what's building up the
[1:10:55] promises of God you're you're storing up
[1:10:58] all these promises the promises are
[1:11:00] piling up within you until your son
[1:11:02] begins to take place you begin to
[1:11:03] realize that it is true that God is a
[1:11:06] miracle-working God that God still is
[1:11:08] the god that keeps his promises I want
[1:11:11] to declare to you this morning you're
[1:11:12] going to accumulate something in your
[1:11:14] life I remember that time brother Brown
[1:11:15] preached he said he said I don't like to
[1:11:17] talk about this but you know people
[1:11:19] sometimes will accumulate complaints
[1:11:20] they'll come to church and they start
[1:11:22] accumulating complaints and complaints
[1:11:24] and you're going to have a oh you come
[1:11:26] to church and you're going to have a lot
[1:11:27] of things that you can complain about
[1:11:28] there's a lot of things that you can
[1:11:30] point your finger at but he said what
[1:11:31] will happen is you start accumulating
[1:11:33] complaints and complaints and complaints
[1:11:34] until you just turn oh what do you turn
[1:11:36] into you turn into somebody that's Satan
[1:11:39] will just Crown your life a good old
[1:11:41] complainer that they can't can't deal
[1:11:43] when somebody pulls out in front of you
[1:11:44] can't deal with somebody don't give you
[1:11:46] the right change in the supermarket
[1:11:48] you're just a complainer because oh but
[1:11:50] I don't want to build up those kind of
[1:11:51] things I want to build up Faith I want
[1:11:53] to build up love
[1:11:54] oh there's things you could build up
[1:11:57] bitterness to one another you can build
[1:11:58] up things where you just you just start
[1:12:00] holding resentments because somebody
[1:12:01] said something to you years ago oh but
[1:12:04] oh if we can just let those things go
[1:12:06] let it go oh if you really study our
[1:12:09] faith you'll find out that forgiveness
[1:12:11] is actually connected to Faith that you
[1:12:14] got to forgive to be able to believe
[1:12:15] right oh you've got to love to be able
[1:12:17] to believe right how can you love God if
[1:12:20] you don't believe it how can you believe
[1:12:21] God if you don't love him and if you if
[1:12:23] you say you really love God and you
[1:12:25] don't love your brother and sister how
[1:12:28] could you love God who you haven't seen
[1:12:30] uh when you when you can't love your
[1:12:32] brother and sister who you have seen
[1:12:34] forgiveness forgiveness is connected to
[1:12:36] Faith because Jesus said if you forgive
[1:12:38] me in their trespasses your heavenly
[1:12:40] father will also forgive you but if you
[1:12:43] forgive not man their trespasses neither
[1:12:44] will your father forgive your trespasses
[1:12:46] oh so let's accumulate the good and
[1:12:49] let's just lay up lay the lay the bad to
[1:12:52] the side that's what Paul told us in
[1:12:53] Hebrews chapter 12 let us lay aside
[1:12:56] every weight and the sin was just so
[1:12:58] easily beset us oh hold church I'm
[1:13:01] trying to get bad really the bad I'm
[1:13:03] trying to get rid of all the trash all
[1:13:05] the things in my life that weigh me down
[1:13:07] and anything that's going to keep me
[1:13:08] from going on with God I I want to cast
[1:13:10] it to the side lay aside all those
[1:13:12] weights and just build up build up what
[1:13:14] I want to accumulate love I want to
[1:13:16] accumulate faith I want to accumulate
[1:13:19] Joy I want to accumulate peace I want to
[1:13:21] accumulate goodness I want those things
[1:13:23] to stack up in my life until until all
[1:13:26] that's left it's not me anymore but
[1:13:28] crushed only Christ to live oh I was
[1:13:31] preaching last Wednesday night at our
[1:13:33] church on perfect Faith perfect faith
[1:13:35] faith is perfected in your weakness and
[1:13:38] when you get to a place where you just
[1:13:39] realize that oh you're weak within
[1:13:41] yourself and you begin to lay aside
[1:13:43] everything that's when God can do
[1:13:44] something for you
[1:13:47] oh I just want to accumulate the word
[1:13:50] accumulate Faith how are we doing it
[1:13:52] precept upon precept line upon line here
[1:13:55] a little there a little in First Peter
[1:13:57] chapter two it says ye also his Lively
[1:13:59] stones are built up of spiritual how
[1:14:01] ought to think that God is building he's
[1:14:03] building up a temple that he can dwell
[1:14:04] in he's building up our lives and
[1:14:07] building up our lives word upon word
[1:14:09] here a little there little oh that's why
[1:14:11] we can say this morning that coming to
[1:14:12] church is not in vain coming to church
[1:14:15] that the word that you hear is actually
[1:14:16] having an effect on your life it's
[1:14:19] actually the word is actually claim but
[1:14:21] what's happening when you hear the word
[1:14:22] as you hear the word the word is
[1:14:24] claiming it's taking possession of you
[1:14:26] oh you look back in your life remember
[1:14:28] remember when first somebody told you
[1:14:30] that you needed to be baptized and you
[1:14:32] battled it out until God finally spoke
[1:14:35] to you and told you the truth of how to
[1:14:37] be baptized and you went into the water
[1:14:38] and the word claims your life it took
[1:14:40] possession of you oh somebody told you
[1:14:43] you got to be born born again and maybe
[1:14:45] they laid it out to you how to be how to
[1:14:47] be born again and how all these things
[1:14:49] work and you begin to you begin to cry
[1:14:51] and you begin to seek God and what was
[1:14:53] it the word taking possession of your
[1:14:55] life it's moving you moving you on and
[1:14:57] on with God what is it the promises are
[1:14:59] being fulfilled in your life something
[1:15:01] Supernatural is happening in your life
[1:15:03] as you hear the word something
[1:15:05] Supernatural is taking place oh oh
[1:15:07] Church we're not just here just to fill
[1:15:09] up church pew or paid our tithes to keep
[1:15:11] the lights on we're not here just to pay
[1:15:13] the parking light bill or we're here to
[1:15:15] for the word of God to be made manifest
[1:15:18] in you oh aren't you glad this morning
[1:15:20] church to have a background aren't you
[1:15:22] glad this morning that you can look back
[1:15:24] at all the things that God has done in
[1:15:26] your life aren't you glad that you got a
[1:15:28] story like Moses did to give you faith
[1:15:30] in the hour away you can look back oh if
[1:15:33] he was the god of yesterday he still
[1:15:35] looks same yesterday today and forever
[1:15:37] if he was the god of back then he's he's
[1:15:40] still the same today whatever your
[1:15:41] trials is or whatever your troubles are
[1:15:43] he's still the same
[1:15:45] oh to think if you didn't go if you
[1:15:48] didn't go through all those trials all
[1:15:49] those things that you can look back on
[1:15:51] you wouldn't be able to praise him like
[1:15:52] you can now if you didn't go through all
[1:15:54] those situations you wouldn't be able to
[1:15:56] know him like you did now you wouldn't
[1:15:58] be able to worship him like you do now
[1:16:00] and Moses had all this background Moses
[1:16:03] had all that background where he could
[1:16:05] trust Jacobus testimony
[1:16:08] and one day he met that burning bush
[1:16:12] he met that burning bush where God spoke
[1:16:14] to him out of the pillar of Fire
[1:16:15] and said I am the god of thy father old
[1:16:18] church is one thing to hear from man but
[1:16:20] it changes everything when you hear from
[1:16:22] God
[1:16:23] I'm talking about this morning hearing
[1:16:25] from your papa oh you think about that
[1:16:27] story where Billy Paul told about how he
[1:16:29] walked outside of the prayer room when
[1:16:31] his dad was praying and he heard him
[1:16:33] calling out to God calling out Paul pop
[1:16:35] of God old Papa God
[1:16:37] whole to think this morning church said
[1:16:39] one day one day you you might have heard
[1:16:42] a lot of people telling you about the
[1:16:43] message and telling you about scripture
[1:16:45] and telling you all these things but
[1:16:46] when one day one day you met God you met
[1:16:49] your papa you met your father and you
[1:16:51] began to really know him the power of
[1:16:53] his resurrection brother Adam said he's
[1:16:54] seeking not something he read about but
[1:16:56] something he's seen with his eyes
[1:16:57] something that spoke back to him and he
[1:17:00] spoke back to you at oh how that did
[1:17:02] bring things to life oh you can realize
[1:17:04] like brother Adam said one time he said
[1:17:06] I come to the realization that I'm not
[1:17:08] the child of Charles and Ella Branham
[1:17:09] that that I I always found out who was
[1:17:12] real daddy was oh and you found out who
[1:17:14] your real daddy is and you find out
[1:17:16] begin you you begin to have you're the
[1:17:17] same characteristics the same thought
[1:17:19] the same life oh beginning you begin to
[1:17:21] realize oh you take a DNA test and it'll
[1:17:24] show you who your daddy is you look into
[1:17:25] the word and it's like getting a DNA
[1:17:27] test where you can find out who your
[1:17:29] real daddy is oh when you begin to be
[1:17:31] identified with a scripture and look
[1:17:33] into the scripture and see that it
[1:17:34] identifies you that you really are
[1:17:36] called of God oh Moses knew who his
[1:17:39] daddy was or can we say that to this
[1:17:41] morning church said oh we know who our
[1:17:43] daddy is and when you know who your
[1:17:45] daddy is that oh and you can hold that
[1:17:47] token up over your prayer and say I know
[1:17:49] who my daddy is oh something's got to
[1:17:52] happen when you can say I'm identified
[1:17:54] by the same life the same life that was
[1:17:57] that was shed on the cross for me that
[1:17:58] same life that was shed on Calvary I'm
[1:18:01] identified that for that this morning
[1:18:02] you can hold that over your prayer and
[1:18:04] claim every promise that's what I'm
[1:18:07] talking about this morning church said
[1:18:08] every promise is for you every promise
[1:18:11] in the Bible is mine if you could claim
[1:18:13] it and believe it oh when you've heard
[1:18:16] from your father well what confidence he
[1:18:18] gave Moses in that hour when he finally
[1:18:20] heard from his daddy
[1:18:22] when he finally realized that God was
[1:18:24] backing him up when he finally realized
[1:18:27] that God was backing up his ministry
[1:18:29] that God was backing up his prayer that
[1:18:31] God would back up his actions because
[1:18:33] God's promises were behind him oh you
[1:18:36] think this morning if you when you've
[1:18:37] heard from your father no devil can stop
[1:18:40] you oh to think this morning oh let me
[1:18:42] just Express this to the church you
[1:18:44] don't have to make a deal with the Devil
[1:18:46] right many times we'll think well well I
[1:18:49] just I just I guess I just got to deal
[1:18:51] with this oh oh that's what we battle
[1:18:53] out church we the promises of God are
[1:18:55] just laying there in front of us and we
[1:18:57] can just if we can just grab that
[1:18:59] promise God said it God said it if you
[1:19:01] can believe it but we'll think well well
[1:19:04] I've just been in this situation so long
[1:19:06] I I just ready to go to the doctor and
[1:19:08] let the doctor work it out because we
[1:19:10] think the promises are not for us but
[1:19:12] the promises are for you because God
[1:19:14] cared enough about for you for to die on
[1:19:16] the cross for his promises he saw enough
[1:19:18] value in you to give these promises to
[1:19:20] you he saw enough let me tell you he
[1:19:22] cared enough about you for you for him
[1:19:24] to send fivefold Ministry to the church
[1:19:26] to preach to you he cared enough about
[1:19:28] it for for a minute for it to sin God
[1:19:30] called ministers to labor and give up
[1:19:33] their own time and lay down their lives
[1:19:35] and study so that you could have so that
[1:19:37] they could preach these promises to you
[1:19:39] oh he cared enough these promises are
[1:19:41] for you oh we begin to think well I
[1:19:43] would like to put the the man at the
[1:19:45] pool of Bethesda I've been laying here
[1:19:46] for 38 years 38 years 38 years but yeah
[1:19:49] he hung on it was 38 years but he was
[1:19:52] still hanging on to the promises of God
[1:19:54] that woman with the issue with 12 years
[1:19:55] 12 years she hang on but yet on that day
[1:19:58] when it really counted she said I
[1:20:00] believe if I can just touch the hymn of
[1:20:02] His Garment and she crawled through the
[1:20:04] crowd until she reached out why because
[1:20:05] she knew if she could get to Jesus that
[1:20:09] man born black born blind from birth and
[1:20:12] one day he met the one that could
[1:20:14] fulfill the promise all you think about
[1:20:16] Congressman Upshaw falling off of that
[1:20:18] fallen off of that bail that that wagon
[1:20:20] when he was a little child and 56 years
[1:20:23] later oh you think you think today this
[1:20:26] morning church that the promises of God
[1:20:28] are passed me that it's not really for
[1:20:30] me but you don't have to make a deal
[1:20:32] with the devil and say well I'll just
[1:20:34] live like this you don't have to take
[1:20:36] nothing from the devil listen I believe
[1:20:39] the devil's been given enough problems
[1:20:40] to the bride all the year I believe it's
[1:20:42] time that we can give something back to
[1:20:44] him we could trouble the devil a little
[1:20:46] bit how are you going to trouble the
[1:20:47] devil you stand by faith believe oh
[1:20:49] you're going to stand for something you
[1:20:51] might as well stand for the word you
[1:20:53] might as well stand and say I'm going to
[1:20:54] believe God's worth no matter what's no
[1:20:57] matter what else comes listen this
[1:20:59] morning church I I believe that it's
[1:21:01] possible because all things are possible
[1:21:03] it's possible for you to be healed it's
[1:21:06] possible for you to be saved it's
[1:21:07] possible for you to be delivered oh this
[1:21:10] there is nothing Out Of Reach there is
[1:21:14] oh if if the statement the statement all
[1:21:18] things are possible means that there is
[1:21:20] nothing impossible
[1:21:22] oh to think this morning that that very
[1:21:24] first sermon that brother Brandon
[1:21:26] preached was talking about something
[1:21:27] impossible that we think is impossible
[1:21:28] to be able to look at something hanging
[1:21:30] from the from the ceiling to be able to
[1:21:32] move it by faith or to think that God
[1:21:35] can take your pocket knife that's in
[1:21:36] your dresser at home and if it ain't if
[1:21:38] it ain't in your pocket he can put it
[1:21:40] there
[1:21:41] foreign
[1:21:47] for somebody else but not for me but I
[1:21:49] want to maybe look look back in your own
[1:21:51] life and remember those times when you
[1:21:53] pray for something and God put it where
[1:21:54] it wasn't it wasn't supposed to be oh oh
[1:21:57] surely as we look across the
[1:21:59] congregation there's testimonies in your
[1:22:01] own life where you've seen that come to
[1:22:03] pass where you seeing God fulfill his
[1:22:05] promises and now if God can do it back
[1:22:07] then surely he's still the same God oh
[1:22:11] you see what the preaching of the Gospel
[1:22:12] does is it builds our faith as word upon
[1:22:15] word is being built up and surely even
[1:22:17] sitting here this morning you can feel
[1:22:19] your face begin to rise like brother and
[1:22:21] when he was talking about and looking to
[1:22:22] the Unseen he said can't you feel that
[1:22:24] pulsating within your heart what is it
[1:22:26] it's a deep call into the deep a deep
[1:22:28] knowing that there's a God that's out
[1:22:30] there somewhere that can fulfill his
[1:22:32] promises my Father in Heaven promised it
[1:22:34] and if he promised it he's able to bring
[1:22:36] it to pass and it's not Out Of Reach
[1:22:39] it's not Out Of Reach like the devil's
[1:22:40] trying to put in our minds that it's
[1:22:42] Saturday it's not Out Of Reach ask and
[1:22:45] you shall receive you don't have because
[1:22:47] you don't ask
[1:22:50] ask abundantly that your joy may be full
[1:22:52] if the promises laying there in the word
[1:22:54] then you've got a right to ask for it
[1:22:56] you've got to write to it because God
[1:22:58] promised it oh now now brother Brian
[1:23:01] will say he said I don't I can't promise
[1:23:03] you a rose guard and I can't promise you
[1:23:05] that life is going to be a flower a bit
[1:23:06] of ease I can't promise it ain't going
[1:23:08] to be no heartaches and no troubles and
[1:23:10] everything but I I can promise it when
[1:23:12] heartaches come that there's a father in
[1:23:14] Heaven that can you can turn to that'll
[1:23:15] be your comforter that'll be your leader
[1:23:17] that'll be your God it'll be your help
[1:23:19] somebody that you can turn to and
[1:23:21] somebody that you could turn to to get
[1:23:22] you out of the situation to know that
[1:23:25] that's just for uh but for a season you
[1:23:27] might be on the ass sheep you might be
[1:23:28] in the OR on in the brick here and
[1:23:30] wherever you are but there's a God that
[1:23:32] you can turn to because there is nothing
[1:23:34] Out Of Reach there is nothing that is
[1:23:37] not possible oh let me let me just
[1:23:40] testify a little bit I began I was
[1:23:42] walking outside the other Friday it was
[1:23:44] Friday I was walking around my uh taking
[1:23:46] a walk down the yard just thinking upon
[1:23:48] these things and I began to think about
[1:23:50] how many things in our life we just kind
[1:23:52] of we just kind of let the devil beat us
[1:23:53] up and tell us that well well it's it's
[1:23:56] beyond your reach it's beyond you might
[1:23:58] as well not even ask for it because all
[1:24:01] your humanity and all these things of
[1:24:03] life
[1:24:03] and I began to think about how we've
[1:24:07] we've got promises that we can have
[1:24:08] access to and I started thinking that
[1:24:10] thinking about all the things in my life
[1:24:12] that oh wow just rolling through why
[1:24:15] don't you ask God about that one thing I
[1:24:17] began to think about is that for the
[1:24:19] last 10 years I worked from home and I
[1:24:21] need internet to be able to work from
[1:24:23] home and I began at the last 10 years
[1:24:25] I've been struggling with I don't have
[1:24:27] internet running to my house and I've
[1:24:28] been struggling trying to get people to
[1:24:30] the the internet company to run the line
[1:24:32] to my house and I've I've paid extra
[1:24:34] money I've gone over them to see over
[1:24:36] and over and over again to try to get
[1:24:38] them to set up internet with my house
[1:24:39] and the last time I was down there a few
[1:24:41] months ago at the office they told me
[1:24:43] I'm sorry they put it in the system and
[1:24:45] they said they're not even going to be
[1:24:46] able to get to it until the next of the
[1:24:48] year and we don't even know when they're
[1:24:49] going to be get to it and so I always
[1:24:51] you start thinking well it's just it's
[1:24:53] impossible I don't know what to do but I
[1:24:55] began to think God you are the god of
[1:24:58] the impossible and I begin to just ask
[1:24:59] him as I walked along I began to say God
[1:25:01] I know that you're you're a prayer
[1:25:03] friends from God and I just ask the Lord
[1:25:06] that you'll just take this situation and
[1:25:08] and do something with it you can you can
[1:25:10] move on the scene I I come back from my
[1:25:12] little walk and I walked in the door and
[1:25:14] it wasn't just a few more minutes that I
[1:25:15] got a phone call on my phone and it was
[1:25:18] about eight o'clock at night and I said
[1:25:19] who who is this could be calling me and
[1:25:22] I picked up the phone and it was the
[1:25:24] internet company and the man said you
[1:25:25] are the last call on my list tonight I
[1:25:28] didn't know if I'd be able to get to you
[1:25:29] but I just wanted to tell you that
[1:25:30] they're going to be in because
[1:25:31] construction next week and I I hung up
[1:25:35] the phone and I said oh God surely you
[1:25:38] are a prince prayer entry God you you
[1:25:40] are the god of the impossible and I just
[1:25:43] want to Echo that to you if God can do
[1:25:45] he's the god of the little things and
[1:25:47] the god of the big things and everything
[1:25:49] if it seems like it's past our reach
[1:25:51] past past anything oh God is the god of
[1:25:55] the impossible almost certainly this
[1:25:57] morning our faith can be built up to
[1:25:58] believe that all you think this morning
[1:26:00] of all the things that maybe you think
[1:26:02] are Out Of Reach in your life all the
[1:26:04] things that you think you think are past
[1:26:07] past anybody be able to do anything oh
[1:26:10] that's certainly that's certainly a good
[1:26:11] candidate for you to turn that over on
[1:26:13] God cast that kind of care over on God
[1:26:15] cast the impossible things over on God
[1:26:17] and watch him work the impossible
[1:26:20] in Mark chapter 10 Jesus looking upon
[1:26:22] Him saith with men it is impossible but
[1:26:25] not with God for With God all things are
[1:26:28] possible all things are possible to them
[1:26:31] that believe
[1:26:32] all things are possible
[1:26:35] oh oh to think this morning I I'm
[1:26:37] running out of time I'll be closing here
[1:26:39] in just a minute Satan doesn't have to
[1:26:41] disprove the Bible
[1:26:42] he just has to get you to reasonably
[1:26:44] doubt something he just has to get you
[1:26:46] the reason oh to think about people say
[1:26:48] Reasonable Doubt but there ain't nothing
[1:26:49] reasonable about doubt there ain't
[1:26:52] nothing reasonable about it well you
[1:26:54] think well it's just it's a reasonable
[1:26:55] doubt to expect that whatever this
[1:26:58] probably just won't work in this case in
[1:27:00] this case that I'm living in it just
[1:27:01] won't work or you're just a little bit
[1:27:03] too sick you're just a little bit
[1:27:05] there's just a little bit too much sin
[1:27:07] in your life oh but look at all these
[1:27:09] examples in the Bible too much sin in
[1:27:11] your life look at Rahab on that wall
[1:27:13] look at look at look at Ruth come out of
[1:27:16] Moab that brother around said was like a
[1:27:18] hair gaggy thing a hair in the biscuit
[1:27:20] look at all these situations where
[1:27:22] people in The Quagmire are seeing but it
[1:27:24] wasn't it wasn't past it wasn't
[1:27:26] impossible oh if you can trust your
[1:27:28] daddy there is nothing impossible
[1:27:30] nothing is impossible this morning
[1:27:33] I'll close on that this this morning as
[1:27:35] the musicians come that I can do all
[1:27:38] things through Christ I can do all
[1:27:40] things through Christ which
[1:27:41] strengtheneth me anything different
[1:27:43] anything different to think about this
[1:27:45] this morning anything different is a lie
[1:27:48] of the devil oh the devil wants to tell
[1:27:50] you it's just reasonable but that is a
[1:27:52] lie of the devil anything different is a
[1:27:55] lie of the devil and you are called to
[1:27:56] resist the devil all things are possible
[1:27:59] to them that believe all things are
[1:28:02] possible nothing is impossible to him
[1:28:03] that believeth oh and Moses come to that
[1:28:06] place where he began to he began to that
[1:28:08] place of of the junction time he began
[1:28:10] to cry out to God and God told him what
[1:28:12] are you crying for
[1:28:13] speak
[1:28:15] oh God wants us to speak
[1:28:18] you know brother Ram said in the
[1:28:19] greatest battle ever fall he said you
[1:28:20] come out of the egg speaking you come
[1:28:22] out of the egg like a little Eagle
[1:28:24] speaking and that's what God wants us to
[1:28:26] do this morning speak with us speak what
[1:28:28] God's word says
[1:28:30] speak his promise
[1:28:32] he's the one that made the promise and
[1:28:35] if God made the promise
[1:28:37] he can back at a
[1:28:39] God made it aren't you glad this morning
[1:28:41] that I didn't make the promise
[1:28:43] your pastor didn't make the promise
[1:28:45] brother Branham didn't make the promise
[1:28:48] God's the one that made the promise and
[1:28:51] if our heavenly father made the promise
[1:28:53] then he's a good God and able to keep
[1:28:56] his word aren't you glad that this
[1:28:59] morning
[1:29:00] oh this morning as we as we just go to
[1:29:02] prayer I want you to maybe meditate on
[1:29:04] all those things in your life
[1:29:06] that you think are impossible
[1:29:10] the devil's been telling you all this
[1:29:11] time that it's past it's past the roots
[1:29:13] of any man
[1:29:15] Pastor maybe you look in the Bible and
[1:29:17] you read about how other people have
[1:29:18] been blessed and you hear testimonies
[1:29:20] and you think well that was for them but
[1:29:22] maybe not for me
[1:29:23] that's if there's any message I want to
[1:29:25] deliver and leave to it we do this
[1:29:26] morning that is for you that if you can
[1:29:29] believe it that all things are possible
[1:29:33] that God can restore those lost children
[1:29:35] God can restore that lost wallet God can
[1:29:39] do it he can do it he can do it like he
[1:29:42] got on God on the scene and got the
[1:29:45] internet company to call me at 8 30 in
[1:29:48] the evening after they had already
[1:29:49] closed I was the last call on his list

[1:33:16] mine
[1:33:19] is
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:39] [Music]
[1:33:39] [Applause]
[1:33:44] wow
[1:33:46] say that backwards
[1:33:48] wow
[1:33:50] do you know
[1:33:52] we commonly understand that the term
[1:33:55] Jehovah Jireh means the Lord our
[1:33:57] provider and it does that's what it
[1:33:58] means
[1:33:59] but the but the beauty of that Hebrew
[1:34:03] connection of speech there Jehovah Jireh
[1:34:07] is how God provides Jehovah Jireh
[1:34:11] literally means God sees
[1:34:14] and we'll see to it
[1:34:18] I I tell the devil that all the time the
[1:34:21] devil tries to make me doubt I say God
[1:34:22] sees and God will see to it my I was
[1:34:27] right in the middle brother close so
[1:34:29] quickly I was right in the middle of
[1:34:30] writing a note I could not possibly
[1:34:32] forget I have never thought about
[1:34:35] resist the devil
[1:34:37] remember remember where that starts
[1:34:40] submit yourselves to God
[1:34:42] you know because no one's ever
[1:34:44] successfully resisted the devil who
[1:34:47] didn't first submit themselves to God
[1:34:50] submit yourselves to God resist the
[1:34:52] devil and he will flee from you and I
[1:34:55] never thought to apply that in all my
[1:34:57] life brother Bob never thought to apply
[1:34:59] that that when God gives a promise like
[1:35:01] Jesus said all things are possible to
[1:35:03] them that believe and the devil wants to
[1:35:06] challenge that it's up to me to be the
[1:35:08] resistance
[1:35:09] right you're in a resistance movement
[1:35:11] when the devil wants to you need you
[1:35:14] need to be David you need to be the man
[1:35:16] in whose ears Goliath challenge fell and
[1:35:20] brother Brown said he made that
[1:35:21] challenge and made that challenge and
[1:35:22] everything was all right he said but
[1:35:25] finally that challenge fell in the ears
[1:35:27] of the wrong man oh and David wasn't
[1:35:30] going to have that David stepped forward
[1:35:32] to say no just a second my God we
[1:35:35] Deliver us
[1:35:38] hallelujah
[1:35:39] oh my goodness I you know I I thought
[1:35:43] about
[1:35:44] so much the brother was saying that you
[1:35:48] know it reminded me of brother Abraham
[1:35:49] when he was here and taught us you know
[1:35:51] that very same thing that you don't have
[1:35:53] to make a deal with the Devil
[1:35:56] you don't have to do that because we
[1:35:57] don't live by the mercies of Lucifer
[1:36:00] in that wonderful we don't live by the
[1:36:03] mercies of Lucifer I don't need his
[1:36:05] permission and I don't need a treaty and
[1:36:09] I don't need an Armistice I don't even
[1:36:10] want one
[1:36:11] I want to fight amen I want to I want to
[1:36:15] prove that he's a liar and God's word is
[1:36:19] true and the Lord has so designed it
[1:36:22] that you will be the evidence of his of
[1:36:25] his honesty and his Integrity think
[1:36:28] about that Psalms teaches us that
[1:36:30] children are the heritage of the Lord
[1:36:32] happy is the man who hath his quiver
[1:36:34] full of them see because the father
[1:36:37] that's a court case remember he said his
[1:36:39] his children will will uh will they'll
[1:36:43] fight with the enemies in the gate the
[1:36:45] gate was the courtroom the father had
[1:36:47] been falsely accused that he wasn't a
[1:36:48] decent man wasn't a good father and the
[1:36:50] father never had to open his mouth never
[1:36:52] had to defend himself because his
[1:36:54] children stepped forward and contended
[1:36:57] with the enemy in the court and the and
[1:36:59] the Hebrew shows it was a victorious
[1:37:01] that they were willing to say you think
[1:37:04] our father was no good then look at us
[1:37:06] then tell pray tell how did we get to be
[1:37:10] a righteous family oh and the case was
[1:37:13] was proven that the father who never had
[1:37:16] to defend himself was he was proven to
[1:37:19] be true
[1:37:20] because why his children contended
[1:37:24] victoriously with the enemies in the
[1:37:27] gate oh I'm not supposed to be preaching
[1:37:29] brother but oh oh man wow
[1:37:34] oh I I thought about how that you know
[1:37:38] it's good
[1:37:40] it's brother Bob said it's good to
[1:37:41] rehearse the things
[1:37:43] that God has done for you that's why
[1:37:45] those stones were about and they said in
[1:37:47] future Generations your children are
[1:37:48] going to say what means these Stones see
[1:37:51] and he's and he said and you know most
[1:37:53] most that was a real story in fact is
[1:37:56] many theologians believe
[1:37:59] that when when you know when they said
[1:38:03] to Jesus as he's crossing over and
[1:38:05] coming down into Jerusalem and he's he's
[1:38:08] he's coming very near right where John
[1:38:10] was baptizing and had been baptizing and
[1:38:13] they they're they're shouting Hosanna
[1:38:15] Hosanna and they they said tell these
[1:38:18] people to be quiet and Jesus said if
[1:38:20] they hold their peace the stones the
[1:38:22] rocks and most most theologians believe
[1:38:24] he was referring right to those that
[1:38:26] were still there in the Jordan uh under
[1:38:28] Joshua that these are proof that God
[1:38:31] lives and keeps his word oh my it's good
[1:38:36] to rehearse you know I can I can say
[1:38:40] I can say to you today
[1:38:43] and I've been believing God since a
[1:38:47] child you know why because I was taught
[1:38:49] that
[1:38:50] I was taught by my parents to believe
[1:38:54] God believe the word I was taught that I
[1:38:57] was raised that but there had to come a
[1:38:59] day I had to prove that myself and as I
[1:39:02] began to prove it as a young man and I
[1:39:04] began to take God at his word friends I
[1:39:06] can tell you here today and I'm just
[1:39:08] maybe a month or a little more than a
[1:39:10] month shy of of three score and I can
[1:39:14] tell you that I have never ever ever
[1:39:18] seen God fail to keep his word
[1:39:22] if I said anything else I'd be lying I
[1:39:25] have never seen him fail to keep his
[1:39:28] word lots of things happen that I didn't
[1:39:30] understand and then later on I say well
[1:39:33] Lord you knew better anyway didn't you
[1:39:35] you got that same testimony today I'm a
[1:39:38] witness that he's been that he's been
[1:39:41] faithful amen amen and you know I I like
[1:39:45] to say this that I'm a witness that
[1:39:48] I mean I'm a witness that he's he's
[1:39:51] healed me
[1:39:52] yeah
[1:39:53] how many are witness of his healing
[1:39:55] power I'm a witness that he's that he's
[1:39:58] delivered me amen do you believe that
[1:40:00] too
[1:40:02] I'm a witness that he's healed I'm a
[1:40:05] witness that he's delivered amen but you
[1:40:08] know one of the greatest testimonies
[1:40:10] that I have is I'm a witness how many
[1:40:13] times he's restored me again and again
[1:40:16] and again you see because I've never
[1:40:20] been able to walk too good without
[1:40:21] stumbling but he always picks me back up
[1:40:24] he always dusts me off he always puts me
[1:40:27] right back on so how many times has he
[1:40:29] done it again and again and over and
[1:40:32] over and over he heals me delivers me he
[1:40:35] restores me Hallelujah you believe his
[1:40:38] word today
