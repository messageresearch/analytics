[27:03] by a mad howling win
[27:07] [Music]
[27:09] one lonely vessel
[27:12] [Music]
[27:15] so close to home
[27:18] [Music]
[27:20] and one frantic captain
[27:24] [Music]
[27:26] barely keep in
[27:27] control
[27:32] the lighthouse on the hill
[27:36] [Music]
[27:37] could have ended his plight
[27:41] [Music]
[27:43] but its dim beacon's glow
[27:47] [Music]
[27:49] hardly cut through
[27:50] the night
[27:54] though he strained he could not see
[27:58] [Music]
[28:00] for the lack of some light
[28:04] [Music]
[28:06] he heard the crack of the hole
[28:09] the ship soon was full
[28:12] was the captain's last night
[28:18] and all to the thanks
[28:23] of lazy light keeper
[28:27] [Music]
[28:29] the fire did burn
[28:34] but it was only
[28:36] within
[28:39] [Music]
[28:40] it did not reach out
[28:46] to the ones that were needy
[28:49] [Music]
[28:51] oh it could not reach out
[28:57] cause there was soot on
[28:59] the lens

[29:09] on life's troubled sea

[29:19] [Music]
[29:20] and it's all up to
[29:23] me
[29:26] will my beacon shine
[29:30] [Music]
[29:32] through this darkened world of sin
[29:35] [Music]
[29:37] or will he like

[29:53] [Music]
[29:55] lazy light keeper
[29:58] [Music]
[30:00] my fire does burn
[30:05] but is it only within
[30:08] [Music]
[30:12] will it reach out
[30:17] to the ones that are needy
[30:22] how can it reach out
[30:25] [Applause]
[30:25] [Music]
[30:27] or is there soon on my
[30:30] land
[30:33] oh can it reach out
[30:36] [Music]
[30:39] or is there soot on my
[30:43] legs

[37:29] and uh we wanna
[37:31] thank you for coming out tonight i got
[37:34] something on my heart i actually
[37:36] initially had something on my heart and
[37:37] i i you know we talked brother jason
[37:39] about it and he was going to give me a a
[37:41] wednesday night to you know talk to
[37:42] y'all and
[37:44] a couple days later i got something else
[37:45] on my heart and it you know had the
[37:47] age-old struggle of what do i preach and
[37:49] then the more i kind of looked into it
[37:51] the more i realized it kind of went hand
[37:52] in hand and i really had one thought of
[37:54] my heart from two different angles
[37:56] so we're going to try to get through it
[37:57] all tonight
[37:59] with god all things are possible
[38:01] and
[38:02] so um
[38:04] we want to invite you
[38:07] right into the word tonight i kind of
[38:09] want to take as a theme
[38:11] um this scripture
[38:13] um i don't know that i'll reference it a
[38:15] whole lot but it's sort of the theme of
[38:17] what i want to kind of cover
[38:21] um
[38:22] and i want to go
[38:24] to
[38:25] psalms 139
[38:28] and we'll start at verse 1.
[38:32] and i'll wait for y'all to turn there
[38:35] um and while y'all are turning i'm gonna
[38:36] change the batteries in this microphone
[38:58] the handheld tonight because the
[39:00] earpieces make my glasses fall off
[39:03] and then i hear brother tony leaving
[39:04] songs and he uses the handheld so i know
[39:07] how to change batteries
[39:29] awesome
[39:33] all right um
[39:35] psalms 139 verse 1
[39:39] o lord thou hast searched me and known
[39:41] me thou hast thou knowest my down
[39:43] sitting and mine uprising thou
[39:46] understand this my uh thought afar off
[39:49] thou compasses my path and my laying
[39:52] down and are acquainted with all my ways
[39:56] for there is not a word in my tongue but
[39:59] lo oh lord thou knowest it altogether
[40:01] thou hast beset me behind and before and
[40:04] laid thine hand upon me
[40:06] such knowledge is too wonderful
[40:08] wonderful for me it is high
[40:10] i cannot attain unto it
[40:13] and then skipping down to verse 13 for
[40:16] thou has possessed my reigns thou hast
[40:18] covered me in my mother's womb
[40:20] i will praise thee for i am fearfully
[40:22] and wonderfully made
[40:24] marvelous are thy works
[40:26] and
[40:27] that my soul knoweth right well
[40:30] my substance was not hid from thee when
[40:33] i was made in secret and curiously
[40:35] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[40:38] then eyes did see my substance yet being
[40:40] unperfect and in thy book all my members
[40:43] were written
[40:46] which in
[40:48] continuance were fashioned
[40:50] when as yet there was none of them
[40:53] how precious also are thy thoughts unto
[40:56] me o god how great is the sum of them
[40:58] if i should count them they are more in
[41:00] number than the sand when i wake i am
[41:03] still with thee
[41:04] amen as the let's bow our hearts and
[41:08] speak to the lord
[41:10] lord we want to
[41:12] thank you for coming and
[41:13] being here this evening it's so
[41:15] wonderful every to be in your presence
[41:20] that you would anoint my lips lord that
[41:22] to speak the words that these people
[41:23] would need to hear and
[41:25] lord i know that i can't give them
[41:26] anything of my own intellect anything
[41:28] that i would be able to give them would
[41:29] just
[41:30] create more of me and the world does not
[41:32] need any more of that
[41:34] so i asked the lord that you would help
[41:35] me to relax and get out of the way and
[41:38] not allow my nerves to hinder
[41:41] what might you would need to speak to
[41:43] these people
[41:44] and that i would be able to be calm and
[41:47] and be a true
[41:49] microphone for you to speak through
[41:51] and we asked that you would anoint the
[41:53] people's ears that they would be able to
[41:54] hear and pull and operate the gift or do
[41:57] we know that any gift that i have isn't
[41:59] for
[42:00] me to create some sort of beautiful
[42:02] presentation but that i would just be
[42:04] able to get out of the way and and be a
[42:05] channel that the people could operate
[42:07] the gift
[42:08] and that they would be able to to to
[42:11] hear the words that they would need
[42:13] to get them through
[42:15] to the other side and we ask these
[42:16] things
[42:17] and we
[42:19] we appreciate your presence lord and we
[42:20] ask that you be with us throughout the
[42:22] service in jesus name amen
[42:25] and you all can be seated
[42:30] um
[42:32] so
[42:33] i want to start i said i had kind of two
[42:35] two thoughts on my heart and so i'm
[42:37] going to try to take them in phases
[42:39] kind of have phase one and phase two
[42:41] and um the quicker i could get some
[42:43] water the better i got thank you
[42:46] got some dry mouth like you wouldn't
[42:47] believe um
[42:49] so
[42:52] um
[42:54] second thing that kind of i want to
[42:55] start with the second thing first
[42:58] and so the other day i was listening i
[43:00] started going through the seals again
[43:01] and so i started the first seal and
[43:04] brother branham kind of comes down and
[43:05] he gets to this point
[43:07] where he
[43:08] um
[43:10] is talking about the uh white horse
[43:12] rider
[43:13] oh thank you
[43:15] and um he uh
[43:22] so he starts talking about how he
[43:24] hadn't fully understood
[43:26] um what it was about that he looked at
[43:28] all the commentaries and they had all
[43:29] said that it was um the holy spirit
[43:31] had gone forth um
[43:33] but that that day the lord had revealed
[43:35] to him that it wasn't the holy spirit
[43:37] that the white horse rider was actually
[43:38] the antichrist
[43:40] posing as the holy spirit
[43:42] and trying to fake it right and so he
[43:43] he's so we'll kind of set some context
[43:46] up um in revelations uh chapter six
[43:48] verse one
[43:49] it says and i saw when the lamb opened
[43:52] one of the seals and i heard and it were
[43:53] the noise of thunder one of the four
[43:55] bees saying come and see
[43:57] and i saw and behold a white horse and
[43:59] he that sat upon him had a bow and a
[44:01] crown was given unto him and he went
[44:02] forth conquering and to conquer
[44:04] and so he you know after this brother
[44:06] branham kind of comes down does a bunch
[44:08] of commentary on that and then he comes
[44:09] down to show the distinction that
[44:12] there is christ does come on a right
[44:13] white horse with a crown but that's in
[44:15] in revelations chapter 19
[44:18] and so he reads a couple verses there he
[44:20] reads verse 11 and 12. and it says and i
[44:22] saw heaven opened and behold a white
[44:25] horse
[44:26] and he that sat upon him was called
[44:27] faithful and true and in righteousness
[44:29] he does judge and make war
[44:31] his eyes were as a flame of fire and on
[44:33] his head were many crowns
[44:35] and he had a name written that no man
[44:37] knew but he himself
[44:39] and so i'm going to pick up
[44:41] from after brother brandon reads this i
[44:43] want to pick up his his kind of
[44:45] commentary
[44:46] um he says i wish i could stop on this a
[44:48] minute brother brandon knocks on the
[44:50] pulpit and pauses editor
[44:52] oh my i got a good notion but maybe i
[44:54] could if you in the congregation says go
[44:56] ahead
[45:00] it says see nobody knows it did you ever
[45:03] know what the name of uh that the name
[45:05] of jehovah is not correct
[45:08] anybody knows dr vale you know that's
[45:10] true the translators
[45:12] could never translate it it's spelled
[45:14] jvhu
[45:16] uh isn't it it isn't jehovah they
[45:19] couldn't touch it they don't know what
[45:20] it is called it jehovah but it wasn't
[45:23] his name
[45:24] right and he's referencing the fact that
[45:26] jvhu isn't really a thing that you can
[45:28] pronounce that's just what was in the
[45:30] text but you can't really pronounce it
[45:31] there's not a
[45:33] jehovah's just a way to pronounce what
[45:34] we don't know how to pronounce
[45:37] um he says look every time is a victory
[45:39] one or something goes on a name is
[45:42] changed
[45:43] look at the days of abraham
[45:45] he was first abram and never could have
[45:48] that baby until his name was changed to
[45:50] abraham and sarah s-a-r-r-a could not
[45:55] have nothing but a dead womb until her
[45:58] name was changed to s-a-r-a-h
[46:02] okay
[46:03] and then i'm going and he kind of goes
[46:04] down and talks about all the different
[46:05] people who have their names changed um
[46:07] he talks about uh you know jacob and
[46:09] peter um and uh you know simon to peter
[46:12] jacob to israel
[46:15] and it comes down to saul he said saul
[46:17] good name
[46:19] saul was a king one time in israel but
[46:20] he a saul didn't fit an apostle
[46:24] might be all right for a king but not an
[46:26] apostle
[46:27] so jesus changed his name from what from
[46:31] saul to paul
[46:32] now
[46:33] i find this really interesting that
[46:34] brother branham is pointing out he's
[46:36] making an indication that
[46:38] when
[46:40] somebody is shifting position
[46:43] god will actually change their name
[46:46] to indicate what their new
[46:49] position is or if he has a purpose for
[46:51] them or what their
[46:53] their office is kind of changing he'll
[46:54] change their name to reflect their new
[46:56] office right he indicates saul was a
[46:58] perfectly fine name now i actually
[46:59] happen to look up the names uh what the
[47:02] what they mean and i kind of had a
[47:05] couple different places but the best i
[47:07] could find
[47:08] is that saul means desired
[47:11] another place that i found said it was
[47:13] sort of uh prayed for as it or or
[47:16] desired or or asked for
[47:18] um that in other literally what the what
[47:20] the his story was that the people asked
[47:23] god for a king
[47:25] and saul whose name literally means
[47:27] asked for comes along
[47:29] but see this isn't really a good name
[47:31] for an apostle
[47:32] instead it had to be paul
[47:35] which means humble
[47:36] or small okay so
[47:40] the point here is that i'm kind of
[47:42] driving at is when god changes
[47:43] somebody's name it actually changes what
[47:46] they'll manifest right there's there's a
[47:49] life behind the name that you're going
[47:51] to manifest when your name is changed
[47:52] okay
[47:54] um and he says and so continuing on from
[47:57] uh
[47:59] from saul to paul he says and jesus his
[48:02] name on earth was redeemer
[48:05] uh when he was on earth he was the
[48:07] redeemer that's true but he when he
[48:10] conquered death in hell and overcame
[48:11] them
[48:12] and ascended on high he received a new
[48:15] name
[48:16] that's the reason you holler the way you
[48:18] do and they don't get nothing
[48:20] it'll be revealed in the thunders
[48:22] uh-huh see notice the mysteries he's
[48:25] coming writing there's got to be
[48:27] something to change the church
[48:30] you know that there's got to be
[48:32] something notice no man knowed but
[48:34] himself and he reiterates now notice
[48:39] no man node but himself
[48:43] so
[48:45] here he goes
[48:46] he indicates that when someone has their
[48:49] name changed or it's it's an indication
[48:52] that their their their purpose has
[48:54] changed
[48:56] then he goes down all this list of
[48:57] people in in the bible who had their
[48:58] name changed and how their
[49:00] their their manifestation changed based
[49:03] on the name the that they their new name
[49:06] then he indicates
[49:08] that jesus was on on earth as the
[49:10] redeemer then it sins and gets a new
[49:12] name so he's indicating that jesus got
[49:14] an uh changed and got a new name and and
[49:17] therefore his position or purpose is now
[49:20] shifting slightly
[49:22] and then he says that there's got to be
[49:24] something to change the church and the
[49:26] next thing he says is no man knows it
[49:28] which is a reference to the name that no
[49:29] man know knows from revelations 19.
[49:36] okay and so
[49:38] are you guys kind of picking up where
[49:39] i'm going with this
[49:41] and he says and notice and i'm going to
[49:43] skip down a couple paragraphs here
[49:45] he says notice
[49:47] uh
[49:48] christ is not seen anymore see from the
[49:51] time there
[49:53] but he is on a white horse
[49:55] uh so if this guy is writing a right
[49:56] horse talking about the white horse
[49:57] writer
[49:58] he's an impersonator of christ see
[50:01] you get that
[50:02] congregation says amen
[50:04] notice the writer on the white horse
[50:06] don't have any name
[50:08] he might use two or three titles c but
[50:11] he ain't got no name
[50:13] but christ has a name
[50:14] what is it
[50:16] the word of god
[50:17] that's what it is in the beginning was
[50:19] the word and the word was with god and
[50:21] the word was god and the word made flesh
[50:24] see the writer has no name but christ is
[50:26] called the word of god
[50:29] that's what he is he is called that now
[50:32] he's got a name that no man knows but
[50:35] he's called the word of god
[50:38] okay so that's interesting it's an
[50:40] interesting statement he's he's called
[50:42] something that we do know but the name
[50:44] is something that we don't know
[50:45] okay now i thought about this for a
[50:47] minute
[50:48] and well how does how does that work out
[50:50] well after i thought about it for a
[50:51] minute why okay well my name is matthew
[50:54] right everybody all know that
[50:56] but maybe somebody that i've never met
[50:58] before wouldn't know my name
[51:01] but my name means
[51:03] god's gift
[51:06] well
[51:06] you could say that my name is matthew
[51:09] and this guy's never met me might not
[51:10] know my name
[51:12] but i'm also called god's gift
[51:15] okay so christ can have this name that
[51:18] no man knows
[51:19] but we know what it means
[51:22] right we know
[51:24] the essence of it we know what it's
[51:26] going to manifest right we have an
[51:28] indication of what that's going to be
[51:31] so
[51:34] um
[51:44] now the next thing that i wanted to to
[51:46] uh kind of look at
[51:48] is that in when he's referencing uh back
[51:52] here when he says um christ has the name
[51:55] uh the word of god what is it in the
[51:57] beginning was the word the word was god
[51:58] and word was with god and the word was
[52:00] made flesh
[52:01] he's referencing john chapter
[52:04] uh chapter 1 verse 1 and down to verse
[52:07] 14.
[52:08] and
[52:10] um
[52:12] that word as i'm sure you're all aware
[52:14] in the greek is translated to logos
[52:18] now
[52:19] logos
[52:21] i kind of looked into this a lot and it
[52:24] really blew my mind how much there
[52:25] really is in there
[52:27] i don't know if i'll have a whole lot of
[52:29] time to kind of stop on it for a minute
[52:31] um but i'll take a couple minutes um
[52:35] so
[52:36] um
[52:38] the origin of this of this word logos is
[52:42] how it's pronounced in the greek is
[52:44] actually um where we get the word logic
[52:46] from right it is intellect or reasoning
[52:48] or rationality is a lot of different
[52:51] ways you could kind of say it but
[52:52] specifically expressed through the
[52:54] spoken word
[52:55] the original sort of usage of this word
[52:57] would be kind of what we would refer to
[52:59] as a verbal argument
[53:01] it's not just sort of like the logic in
[53:02] your head it's actually what's spoken
[53:05] if you translate it literally it kind of
[53:07] it can mean word that's why in saint
[53:09] john
[53:10] when
[53:11] st john wrote logos the later
[53:14] translators translated logos as word
[53:16] because it kind of means that but
[53:18] specifically what it means is
[53:21] intellect spoken
[53:23] right
[53:24] or intelligence spoken or logic spoken
[53:28] and
[53:30] that's
[53:33] part of it um
[53:37] but see because the greek started using
[53:38] this word about 600 years bc is when the
[53:41] the sort of the idea of logos kind of
[53:43] started coming around
[53:45] but a couple hundred years later you had
[53:47] this group of philosophers called the
[53:48] stoics and they had they took this
[53:50] concept of logos and they expanded it
[53:53] and they said we believe
[53:55] there's a
[53:56] great divine intellect
[53:59] this intellect that sort of underpins
[54:00] all of reality
[54:03] and this intellect it's sort of a
[54:05] supreme logic this this divine
[54:07] consciousness
[54:08] that is expressing itself like sort of
[54:11] like a spoken word kind of thing
[54:14] and as it expresses it manifests into
[54:18] reality
[54:21] and
[54:22] they were right
[54:23] that's that's exactly what it is um
[54:26] and but the way they kind of
[54:27] conceptualized it is it's sort of like a
[54:29] pre-programmed thing like in your mind
[54:32] you have maybe uh something that you're
[54:34] thinking about you know like a a story
[54:37] but in your head it's not logos
[54:40] when you speak it it's logos
[54:43] right actually when it comes out of your
[54:44] mouth is when it becomes logos when it's
[54:46] in your head it's not that's not really
[54:48] what it is it's not until it actually is
[54:50] expressed and they kind of had this idea
[54:53] that kind of at the beginning of
[54:55] everything you have
[54:56] this divine intellect and the way they
[54:59] described it obviously they wouldn't use
[55:01] this analogy but this is the best way i
[55:02] kind of come up with it is actually sort
[55:03] of like a computer program it's
[55:08] this this divine plan that is
[55:11] unraveling and as it unravels what's
[55:14] inside of it
[55:15] becomes real and so
[55:17] um caleb do you have that thing set up
[55:19] for me
[55:20] this is a picture just a quick little
[55:22] demonstration to kind of
[55:24] explain
[55:25] so okay turn it off like
[55:27] like kill it for a second
[55:29] okay so
[55:31] somewhere there's an intelligence back
[55:32] there in the booth in a computer that
[55:34] has all this programming it's a computer
[55:36] it's it's it's got
[55:38] a
[55:39] sort of electronic intellect
[55:42] and so that image that was up there
[55:44] exists right now but it's in ones and
[55:47] zeros it it
[55:48] nowhere can you can see it or interact
[55:50] with it or feel it or touch it
[55:54] but with a push of a button
[55:57] there it is
[55:58] that program manifested
[56:01] right the electronic intellect
[56:03] manifested into a way that you can see
[56:04] it it expressed itself okay so
[56:10] what we're
[56:12] so kind of put a a bow on this
[56:16] when
[56:18] christ
[56:22] uh going going back to to revelations 19
[56:26] when christ ascends and he's got this
[56:28] name that no man knows but we know that
[56:30] it's
[56:31] effectively synonymous with logos
[56:34] christ is ascending
[56:36] and he's taking this position as the
[56:39] divine intellect that will manifest
[56:41] itself into reality
[56:43] right
[56:45] and specifically it's going to manifest
[56:47] itself as flesh
[56:50] it's going to unpack and we see it in
[56:52] nature too look at dna dna is a package
[56:55] of programming
[56:56] right it's in the it's in every seed
[56:59] you know you have a little acorn inside
[57:01] of that is a genetic package
[57:04] that is an
[57:05] oak tree but in in
[57:08] code
[57:09] right it's just it's just conceptual but
[57:11] once you put it in the ground and the
[57:12] thing manifests it turns into a bagel
[57:14] oak tree
[57:15] so the logos of the acorn manifested
[57:19] into the reality of an oak tree
[57:21] okay the same thing with a baby you have
[57:23] a little fertilized cell and in nine
[57:27] months it the logos manifest into life
[57:31] into a baby
[57:33] and
[57:34] so here's god manifesting he's he's
[57:38] conceptual
[57:41] and so once he takes this position and
[57:43] um
[57:45] uh
[57:46] as as this having this name that no man
[57:49] knows but we know that what it means is
[57:52] the plan of god unraveling into reality
[57:57] now
[57:59] going back to
[58:01] um
[58:03] uh i wanna i wanna pick up um the story
[58:07] of ruth for a minute
[58:08] now
[58:09] i in my haste forgot to write down
[58:12] exactly where in the bible this is
[58:14] so we're going to turn to the book of
[58:16] ruth
[58:18] um i believe it's hang on
[58:24] yep
[58:34] judges ruth
[58:37] and i believe
[58:42] okay so we're gonna go to ruth chapter
[58:44] three
[58:45] um
[58:46] and
[58:49] um we'll go to verse 16 and just pause
[58:52] there for a minute um
[58:55] and so i'm going to put a little context
[58:56] on this so in the story
[58:58] ruth is gone uh naomi sends her off to
[59:00] go meet boaz on the threshing floor she
[59:02] goes there uh she spends the night
[59:04] uh boaz tells her that he's gonna um you
[59:06] know he betrothed himself to her and
[59:08] then before he says you can't really be
[59:10] seen here it's gonna be real bad you
[59:11] gotta get out of here before anybody
[59:12] wakes up um so
[59:15] it's you know in the early light no man
[59:17] nobody can tell one from another
[59:19] and she you know he fills her veil full
[59:20] of uh full of uh
[59:23] barley and sends her back home
[59:25] she comes back to the house and
[59:28] um
[59:29] chapped into verse 16. says and when she
[59:32] came to her mother-in-law she said
[59:36] who art thou my daughter and she told
[59:38] her
[59:39] all the man had done to her now
[59:41] i read for a long time this verse i've
[59:45] read the book of ruth many many times
[59:47] i've read this verse a lot of times and
[59:48] every time i read it i read that as she
[59:51] knocked on the door and naomi said who's
[59:53] there
[59:55] but that doesn't make any sense
[59:57] okay
[59:58] because she responds with
[1:00:00] and she told her all that the man did to
[1:00:02] her
[1:00:04] and also why would naomi say who art
[1:00:06] thou my daughter
[1:00:08] okay
[1:00:09] that's so what actually happens
[1:00:12] is ruth knocks on the door and she's
[1:00:14] like nailed me no you're not gonna
[1:00:15] believe what happened
[1:00:16] and naomi's like ruth
[1:00:18] what's your last name
[1:00:20] who are you
[1:00:22] because she's recognizing that when ruth
[1:00:24] goes off to meet boaz in the threshing
[1:00:27] floor and gets in his presence
[1:00:29] she's not gonna come back the same
[1:00:30] person
[1:00:31] she's recognized ruth who are you you're
[1:00:34] you're not ruth no more you're mrs boaz
[1:00:37] what's your name who are you and so
[1:00:42] you see where i'm going with this
[1:00:45] so
[1:00:46] fast forward
[1:00:48] here's christ in an invisible union
[1:00:51] we're not
[1:00:52] people you're not catherine you're not
[1:00:54] josh right you're not brother andrew
[1:00:58] we're mrs jesus christ
[1:01:00] right there's a name attached to this
[1:01:03] and the name we've already established
[1:01:06] when you get a name change it manifests
[1:01:08] into something new
[1:01:11] mrs boaz
[1:01:13] falls in love with the redeemer
[1:01:15] and what does she do
[1:01:18] the next like the next chapter she has a
[1:01:20] baby
[1:01:21] right
[1:01:22] when she gets her name changed she
[1:01:24] manifests the redeemer
[1:01:27] okay
[1:01:30] so
[1:01:31] we get a name change we're gonna
[1:01:33] manifest whatever name got attached to
[1:01:35] that
[1:01:36] you know so
[1:01:38] going back to
[1:01:40] abraham and sarah
[1:01:43] as far as i'm aware
[1:01:45] abraham and sarah are the only people
[1:01:46] that ever got any piece of jehovah's
[1:01:48] name when god changed their name that
[1:01:50] they got a piece of jehovah attached to
[1:01:52] them
[1:01:53] right that he because he added an h to
[1:01:55] their name
[1:01:56] and brother branham goes through there
[1:01:58] and he talks about how that was the h
[1:01:59] from jehovah
[1:02:02] well
[1:02:03] what did that manifest in abraham and
[1:02:05] sarah
[1:02:08] body change
[1:02:09] right
[1:02:11] now
[1:02:13] i
[1:02:14] am not mrs h
[1:02:17] i am mrs jehovah
[1:02:19] there is a full name now attached
[1:02:21] abraham and sarah got a single piece a
[1:02:24] single letter out of that name and it
[1:02:25] gave him a body change temporarily they
[1:02:28] still died
[1:02:29] right they got old and died because they
[1:02:32] only had a
[1:02:34] fraction
[1:02:36] of the logos revealed to them only a
[1:02:38] fraction the logos manifested in their
[1:02:41] day
[1:02:42] only a piece of that name that no man
[1:02:44] knows actually
[1:02:46] manifested but not anymore
[1:02:50] right there's there's a whole name
[1:02:53] that's going to unfold and it's going to
[1:02:54] be more than just a body change and it's
[1:02:56] not going to be temporary it's not going
[1:02:58] to go back we're not going to get old
[1:02:59] and die
[1:03:03] so
[1:03:04] um
[1:03:06] so
[1:03:07] i uh
[1:03:09] gotta
[1:03:12] rehydrate
[1:03:13] um
[1:03:14] now i want to pick up and
[1:03:17] i want to um kind of transition
[1:03:20] a little bit
[1:03:22] uh and
[1:03:23] go down to
[1:03:28] um uh where did i go
[1:03:34] right okay so i'm gonna pick up this
[1:03:36] thing uh
[1:03:37] oh right so uh
[1:03:39] back up i gotta say this first
[1:03:42] um
[1:03:43] there's a piece of foundation that i
[1:03:45] want to hit
[1:03:47] um
[1:03:49] uh
[1:03:54] um he says
[1:03:56] brother brother brandon talking the
[1:03:57] first seals i just had it anyways he's
[1:04:00] talking about the the name of god um and
[1:04:02] i read it i just can't find it in my
[1:04:03] notes now um where he says that it's the
[1:04:06] name that no man knows but it'll be
[1:04:06] revealed and then thunders
[1:04:08] okay
[1:04:10] um
[1:04:11] we're all aware of what the thunders are
[1:04:13] right okay it is the word being revealed
[1:04:16] as the seals break
[1:04:18] so the name of god that no man knows
[1:04:21] will be revealed under the thunders
[1:04:24] okay
[1:04:25] this is
[1:04:26] so in other words it's being revealed
[1:04:27] when the seals break
[1:04:29] okay
[1:04:30] um
[1:04:31] so going down to
[1:04:34] um
[1:04:34] [Music]
[1:04:37] this quote okay so it says the breach
[1:04:39] this is the breach between the churches
[1:04:40] and seven seals the breach message we're
[1:04:42] all familiar um
[1:04:44] and he's talking about the seals and he
[1:04:46] says and the whole thing uh thing here
[1:04:48] is the seven seals got the mysteries of
[1:04:50] god from the foundation of the world all
[1:04:51] sealed up in there uh and revealed by
[1:04:53] seven different seals okay
[1:04:56] um
[1:04:57] uh that if god willing uh let us pull
[1:05:00] back these seals and look down through
[1:05:02] the book
[1:05:03] um
[1:05:04] book uh and find out what it's all about
[1:05:06] okay so he's saying you've got all these
[1:05:07] mysteries tied up in there
[1:05:09] and also we know that the name of god
[1:05:11] that no man knows is also synonymous
[1:05:13] effectively with this divine plan that's
[1:05:15] going to unravel itself
[1:05:17] okay so the divine plan that's going to
[1:05:19] unravel and manifest into reality god
[1:05:21] himself into reality into human form is
[1:05:24] tied up in the seals
[1:05:25] okay we're following
[1:05:28] we're following the logos here
[1:05:30] um
[1:05:30] and
[1:05:31] uh
[1:05:34] okay going down and he says um
[1:05:36] also continuing the breach he says
[1:05:38] jeremiah said
[1:05:39] this scroll must be kept um
[1:05:42] uh as you read it there he would say it
[1:05:44] um it must be kept
[1:05:45] in an earthy earthly vessel see oh what
[1:05:49] a beautiful thing there i could talk
[1:05:51] about a while this scroll was kept in an
[1:05:53] earthly vessel a vessel that once became
[1:05:56] flesh glory died rose again
[1:05:59] and kept in an earthly vessel until the
[1:06:01] time of the purchase oh my beautifully
[1:06:03] all right
[1:06:04] now these messages are all kept up until
[1:06:07] hit uh
[1:06:09] this
[1:06:09] uh earthly vessel until the time of
[1:06:11] god's appointed time
[1:06:13] at the last messenger
[1:06:16] at the earth and all that these people
[1:06:19] had judged and said i know it's there i
[1:06:22] believe it's there and they'd found it
[1:06:23] and brought it forth and produced the
[1:06:25] thing
[1:06:25] by faith they believed it but now it's
[1:06:28] going to be brought to us in revelation
[1:06:30] and from the hand of god by vindication
[1:06:32] god said so he promised it so
[1:06:35] here's brother branham talking about
[1:06:37] that god would take the seven seals the
[1:06:39] mysteries of the seven seals and put
[1:06:41] them in an earthly vessel he references
[1:06:43] christ
[1:06:44] but then he also references that they
[1:06:46] will continue in these earthly vessels
[1:06:47] until the end time
[1:06:50] well what earthly vessels
[1:06:53] because christ's earthly vessel
[1:06:55] wasn't here no more
[1:06:57] okay
[1:06:59] so
[1:07:00] i want to pick up uh second corinthians
[1:07:02] 4
[1:07:03] um
[1:07:05] and
[1:07:05] seven
[1:07:07] um
[1:07:09] but we have this treasure in earthen
[1:07:12] vessels
[1:07:13] that the excellency of the power may be
[1:07:15] of god and not of us
[1:07:17] we are troubled on every side yet not
[1:07:19] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:07:21] despair
[1:07:23] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[1:07:24] but not destroyed always bearing about
[1:07:27] in the body the dying of the lord jesus
[1:07:29] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:07:31] made manifest in our body
[1:07:33] for we which live are always delivered
[1:07:35] unto death for jesus sake that the life
[1:07:37] also of jesus might be made manifest in
[1:07:40] our mortal flesh
[1:07:41] so then death worketh in us but life in
[1:07:44] you
[1:07:45] um
[1:07:46] and i want to kind of reread this from
[1:07:48] the nlt because i kind of like the the
[1:07:49] way it um
[1:07:52] uh
[1:07:53] it says it um
[1:07:54] we now have this light shining in our
[1:07:56] hearts but we ourselves are like fragile
[1:07:58] clay jars containing this great treasure
[1:08:01] this uh do we have it yeah um uh
[1:08:06] great treasure this makes it clear that
[1:08:07] our great power is from god not from
[1:08:09] ourselves
[1:08:11] we are
[1:08:13] pressed on every side by troubles
[1:08:16] but we are not crushed
[1:08:17] we are perplexed but not driven to
[1:08:19] despair
[1:08:20] we're hunted down but never abandoned by
[1:08:23] god we get knocked down but are not
[1:08:25] destroyed
[1:08:28] through sufferings our bodies continue
[1:08:29] to share in the death of jesus so that
[1:08:32] the life of jesus may also also be seen
[1:08:34] in our bodies
[1:08:36] so we live in the face of death but this
[1:08:39] has resulted in eternal life for you
[1:08:42] uh wait did my notes go different from
[1:08:44] what's up there
[1:08:45] okay
[1:08:46] um uh
[1:08:48] oh sorry i missed it first oh there we
[1:08:50] go um but it is a result internal life
[1:08:52] for you okay so
[1:08:55] here's paul talking about how
[1:08:58] we have a we have the power of god
[1:09:00] within us we are an earthly vessel that
[1:09:02] contains the power of god
[1:09:03] okay
[1:09:04] um
[1:09:06] and we're gonna be pressured and put
[1:09:09] under pressure but we're not gonna be
[1:09:10] destroyed
[1:09:11] so that this power that's within us can
[1:09:13] manifest itself and give glory to god
[1:09:15] okay not of us but of god
[1:09:18] okay so
[1:09:21] i kind of want to shift and kind of pick
[1:09:23] up
[1:09:24] what my original
[1:09:26] kind of what started this thought
[1:09:28] um and kind of go into a dale smith
[1:09:32] gear um
[1:09:34] so
[1:09:36] i
[1:09:37] once upon a time worked in a ceramics
[1:09:39] plant now ceramic for any of you guys
[1:09:42] who
[1:09:42] are aware is basically like pottery um
[1:09:45] it's modern pottery um it's the same
[1:09:47] process it's clay you mold it into a
[1:09:49] shape you put it in a big oven cook it
[1:09:50] down and it turns into stone
[1:09:52] and then you use it for whatever it's
[1:09:53] for okay um all your dinner plates are
[1:09:56] ceramic well
[1:09:58] this kind of ceramic that i made is not
[1:10:00] dinner plate ceramic it is a special
[1:10:02] kind of ceramic called piezoelectric
[1:10:04] ceramic um
[1:10:06] it's
[1:10:08] it's 21st century pottery um
[1:10:10] very high-tech stuff it's not
[1:10:13] just
[1:10:15] it's engine it's a very engineered
[1:10:16] product um some very interesting
[1:10:18] properties
[1:10:19] and
[1:10:20] uh
[1:10:21] we'll we'll talk about it a little bit
[1:10:23] um
[1:10:24] so
[1:10:26] the way all this the way the process
[1:10:28] started right because it's it's
[1:10:30] what these components that we were
[1:10:32] making were used for was a lot of
[1:10:33] military
[1:10:34] applications so like one of the projects
[1:10:36] that i worked on was um detection
[1:10:38] systems for torpedoes like incoming
[1:10:41] torpedoes we made components within the
[1:10:43] guidance systems on cruise missiles um
[1:10:46] all kinds of stuff like that
[1:10:49] understandably when you're firing
[1:10:50] several hundred pounds of high
[1:10:52] explosives on a hypersonic rocket you
[1:10:54] kind of can't have any
[1:10:55] tolerance in the quality of your product
[1:10:58] right so the clay that we were using
[1:11:01] isn't just any old clay they didn't go
[1:11:03] out in the rio grande river and just dig
[1:11:05] some out of there it was very
[1:11:07] specifically engineered clay
[1:11:09] okay
[1:11:10] now we are also
[1:11:13] pots right we are vessels we are earth
[1:11:15] and vessels and god did not just find
[1:11:18] any old clay
[1:11:19] right we are 21st century clay some we
[1:11:23] are we're some pretty high-tech mud all
[1:11:25] right okay
[1:11:27] this is
[1:11:28] this is
[1:11:30] um
[1:11:31] right god engineers us
[1:11:33] i want to pick up
[1:11:36] this um this quote this is from things
[1:11:38] that are to be
[1:11:40] just like your birth here i said you
[1:11:42] were prepared god knew you would be here
[1:11:44] and now you know even things uh that
[1:11:47] your parents done now people think uh
[1:11:50] that isn't visited from generation to
[1:11:51] generation but it is
[1:11:53] over in the book of hebrews i believe
[1:11:54] about the seventh chapter speaking paul
[1:11:56] there the writer as i believe it was was
[1:11:59] speaking on a great uh event that taken
[1:12:01] place with abraham
[1:12:03] um and i'm gonna skip down some of this
[1:12:04] and and he skips down and he says um see
[1:12:08] you were all pre-planned by god nothing
[1:12:11] happens by chance with god he knows all
[1:12:14] about it it's all pre-planned
[1:12:17] planned for many generations back so
[1:12:19] that you could be here tonight amen do
[1:12:22] you guys know that
[1:12:23] right
[1:12:25] did you know that just think
[1:12:28] that you at one time
[1:12:30] i'll repeat this again you at one time
[1:12:32] was in your father in the gene of your
[1:12:35] father now
[1:12:37] he didn't know you at that time neither
[1:12:39] did you know him at that time but you
[1:12:41] see
[1:12:42] then you were in the betting ground in
[1:12:44] the womb of of mother through holy
[1:12:46] wedlock and then you became a person
[1:12:48] expressed in the image like your father
[1:12:50] then there's fellowship
[1:12:53] right what do we see here
[1:12:55] you were in the
[1:12:57] unexpressed
[1:12:59] form
[1:13:00] right and through the logos the
[1:13:02] expression of the internal logic you
[1:13:04] manifested
[1:13:05] right
[1:13:08] through this plan of god okay and god
[1:13:10] pre-planned you he you your generation
[1:13:13] you went back many generations
[1:13:16] right
[1:13:18] why
[1:13:20] right you have very specific purpose
[1:13:24] because every one of everybody has to be
[1:13:26] different everybody has to be unique
[1:13:28] remember at the ceramics plant we had a
[1:13:29] lot of different applications
[1:13:31] right
[1:13:32] not every component went to it went to
[1:13:34] one thing like i said we had hundreds of
[1:13:35] different components and god's factory
[1:13:37] has a lot of different components a lot
[1:13:39] of different people right as much as i
[1:13:41] might want to be
[1:13:42] a very articulate and well put together
[1:13:45] and never
[1:13:46] nervous and cool under pressure minister
[1:13:48] like
[1:13:49] brother jason
[1:13:52] i will never be that
[1:13:53] it's not in my genetics and i might want
[1:13:56] to be some fireball dynamo preacher like
[1:13:59] brother brad it's not in my genetics
[1:14:01] right i'm going to preach about ceramics
[1:14:06] because it's in my genetics because
[1:14:09] there was a time when dale smith
[1:14:11] preached about ceramics
[1:14:14] okay i'm i'm the son of a man who
[1:14:16] preached about magnets and fire
[1:14:19] and motor oil
[1:14:21] for 30 years
[1:14:23] and now i'm preaching about
[1:14:25] my job
[1:14:26] you know from a few years back okay this
[1:14:28] is
[1:14:30] because because why because maybe
[1:14:32] there's somebody who needs to hear it
[1:14:34] the way i have i can tell it
[1:14:36] right maybe there's someone who needs to
[1:14:37] hear it the way you have to tell it you
[1:14:39] do realize that preachers aren't the
[1:14:40] only ones who have to witness to people
[1:14:43] right we're all supposed to be witness
[1:14:45] witnessing and maybe god made you the
[1:14:47] way you are because there's someone out
[1:14:49] there who's only be going to be able to
[1:14:51] hear
[1:14:52] the gospel in the way that you
[1:14:54] specifically can tell it
[1:14:57] okay
[1:14:58] so
[1:15:00] um
[1:15:01] now
[1:15:02] this
[1:15:03] kind of leaves a question
[1:15:05] because
[1:15:07] we're not
[1:15:08] always given what we call good genes
[1:15:13] right
[1:15:15] i when i was a little boy had a
[1:15:18] wretchedly hot temper
[1:15:20] okay
[1:15:22] i once tried to beat a neighbor kid to
[1:15:24] death with a shovel
[1:15:27] granted he tried to he touched my sister
[1:15:28] inappropriately but um it happened
[1:15:32] um
[1:15:33] and i tried to i tried to keep like i
[1:15:35] went berserk okay and you think wow you
[1:15:38] got this horrible hot temper from
[1:15:40] brother dale that crazy ex-marine
[1:15:43] sort of no
[1:15:45] you see
[1:15:47] a little
[1:15:48] dorothy lloyd
[1:15:51] now you all know my grandmother little
[1:15:54] darling dorothy lloyd who is an absolute
[1:15:57] sweetheart and who all of you just love
[1:16:00] she's
[1:16:01] just just the sweetest thing would never
[1:16:03] hurt a fly
[1:16:05] but that's because you all know holy
[1:16:07] ghost filled
[1:16:09] many years of growing
[1:16:12] dorothy lloyd you did not know
[1:16:15] unregenerate heathen
[1:16:16] little dorothy
[1:16:19] okay
[1:16:21] now little now reddock by the way red
[1:16:23] hawk is scottish and the scottish are a
[1:16:26] bunch of violent
[1:16:28] drunk
[1:16:29] like hot-headed violent
[1:16:32] people
[1:16:33] and
[1:16:34] it's in the blood and and little dorothy
[1:16:37] reddock one time um decided she was at
[1:16:40] her at her grandparents house and she
[1:16:42] sit in there at dinner time and she says
[1:16:44] pass the taters
[1:16:46] and her grandfather says dorothy say
[1:16:48] please and she said i said pass the
[1:16:51] taters
[1:16:53] and
[1:16:54] her grandfather said dorothy say please
[1:16:56] and she said i said pass the taters and
[1:16:58] she threw a fork at him and it stuck
[1:17:00] right in his face right there in his
[1:17:02] chin
[1:17:05] because it's in her genetics
[1:17:07] right
[1:17:08] now she got the holy ghost and doesn't
[1:17:10] do that no more
[1:17:12] i got the holy ghost and i don't try to
[1:17:14] kill people with shovels no more the
[1:17:16] point is
[1:17:17] sometimes
[1:17:19] god puts things in you that you might
[1:17:22] not have expected
[1:17:24] right it seems kind of toxic to have a
[1:17:27] fiery hot temper
[1:17:28] and the problem is and i know it's kind
[1:17:30] of funny but hey guess what um
[1:17:34] the neighbor kid wasn't the only one i
[1:17:36] tried to kill
[1:17:37] right my brother's got stitches in his
[1:17:38] forehead
[1:17:40] right
[1:17:41] and it wasn't real funny
[1:17:44] and
[1:17:45] it feels real bad
[1:17:47] when you're the one who tried to kill
[1:17:49] your brother
[1:17:51] and
[1:17:52] it's
[1:17:54] the problem isn't that the things that
[1:17:57] you have
[1:17:58] don't hurt you they hurt the people
[1:18:00] around you
[1:18:02] right
[1:18:04] and
[1:18:07] in the ceramics plant
[1:18:10] when they're mixing the batches for
[1:18:13] all these beautiful
[1:18:16] uh
[1:18:17] different purposes
[1:18:18] one of the main ingredients that they
[1:18:20] put in there is powderized lead
[1:18:23] now
[1:18:25] that stuff's real toxic it will give you
[1:18:27] brain damage and you will lose iq points
[1:18:30] if you get that stuff in your blood
[1:18:32] um
[1:18:33] and they treated it
[1:18:35] like it was exactly what it was they
[1:18:38] completely sealed off half the building
[1:18:40] the huge plant um you couldn't enter in
[1:18:43] there without a basically a spacesuit um
[1:18:46] they the people who worked in that area
[1:18:48] the plant had to be blood tested every
[1:18:49] six months
[1:18:50] to make sure they weren't getting lead
[1:18:51] poisoning it was a whole thing right
[1:18:56] because they're mixing the batches in
[1:18:57] there
[1:18:58] now
[1:18:59] my job was kind of right on the border
[1:19:01] like i was on the clean side and then
[1:19:02] but i didn't go into the toxic side but
[1:19:05] i could see in there through like the
[1:19:06] plastic curtains and whatnot and so i'm
[1:19:07] seeing them all walk around and then i'm
[1:19:09] noticing wait a minute the ceramic is
[1:19:10] coming out of there and it's going on
[1:19:12] these trays and coming through this
[1:19:13] curtain and then we're over here picking
[1:19:14] it up and handling it and they give us
[1:19:16] like some little latex gloves and we're
[1:19:17] wearing t-shirts and tennis shoes why
[1:19:19] don't we have bunny suits on
[1:19:21] right
[1:19:22] it's the same stuff
[1:19:24] why why is this ceramic that we're
[1:19:26] handling okay to touch but when they're
[1:19:28] touching it they're wearing spacesuits
[1:19:30] and so i go to my my the engineer who is
[1:19:32] in charge of this whole process and i go
[1:19:34] hey man um i'm a little weirded out
[1:19:37] what's what's the deal why
[1:19:39] why do we not have all the safety
[1:19:41] procedures isn't it toxic
[1:19:43] and he goes well
[1:19:45] that's a really good question
[1:19:47] he goes but
[1:19:48] you see what happens is while it's in
[1:19:50] that powderized form
[1:19:53] it's dangerous because you can it can
[1:19:54] get aerosolized and you can you can
[1:19:56] inhale it and get it through your skin
[1:19:58] he goes but
[1:20:00] what happens is it gets first of all by
[1:20:03] the way
[1:20:04] this powderized
[1:20:06] oop
[1:20:07] that's my alarm
[1:20:10] there it is
[1:20:11] okay go away
[1:20:13] all right
[1:20:14] um so um
[1:20:17] it's it gets put into this giant
[1:20:19] pressure
[1:20:20] press the hydraulic press that
[1:20:23] um
[1:20:24] this powderized
[1:20:25] clay mix and it gets put under like ten
[1:20:27] thousand pounds of pressure and it
[1:20:29] crushes it into the shape that
[1:20:31] um they want it in right it doesn't
[1:20:32] really go on a potter's wheel that
[1:20:33] really wouldn't work
[1:20:35] and so sometimes when god is molding us
[1:20:37] it feels like we're in a ten thousand
[1:20:38] pound vice um
[1:20:41] but ultimately you're gonna have the
[1:20:42] shape that he needs you to be and it'll
[1:20:43] hold that shape for a while but by the
[1:20:45] way in that form it's really brittle
[1:20:48] if you drop it it'll shatter and it's
[1:20:50] still toxic
[1:20:52] right if you touch it wrong it'll bust
[1:20:55] and a lot of people
[1:20:57] they'll get real sanctified
[1:20:59] and they'll have the shape of a
[1:21:00] christian
[1:21:03] right
[1:21:04] but they're still toxic
[1:21:07] and if you poke them a little bit
[1:21:08] they'll break and it'll get all over you
[1:21:11] right
[1:21:13] so
[1:21:15] so i asked this i asked my engineer what
[1:21:18] so going back to why he said that he was
[1:21:20] okay first to handle this ceramic
[1:21:22] he says because
[1:21:24] between the time that it goes through
[1:21:27] the the molding vice the hydraulic press
[1:21:32] and by the time it gets to you it goes
[1:21:34] through
[1:21:35] a giant
[1:21:36] oven
[1:21:38] okay
[1:21:39] that oven takes 18 hours
[1:21:41] huge conveyor belt it goes through there
[1:21:43] takes 18 hours and that stuff cooks at i
[1:21:46] forget what the temperature was it's hot
[1:21:48] enough to turn dirt into jello
[1:21:50] okay
[1:21:51] and it cooks like that for a long time
[1:21:54] and when it comes out he and this was
[1:21:56] his exact words he said the heat the
[1:21:59] fire binds the toxic elements of the
[1:22:02] lead and incorporates it
[1:22:04] into the structure so that it becomes
[1:22:06] useful for its intended purpose
[1:22:10] okay
[1:22:13] i might have had a nasty temper
[1:22:17] little dorothy reddock might have had a
[1:22:19] nasty temper but both of us came in
[1:22:21] contact with some fire one day and it
[1:22:24] doesn't go poisoning anybody anymore
[1:22:26] doesn't go we don't go hurting nobody
[1:22:28] anymore but what it does do is it i'm
[1:22:30] not sure what it did for me but i know
[1:22:32] for grandma gave her a lot of courage to
[1:22:34] go spread the word and not be shy in the
[1:22:35] face of danger i know that much
[1:22:38] i know that there's a lot of times we
[1:22:40] don't understand why we were the way
[1:22:42] they that we were but when we come in
[1:22:44] contact with the fire of the holy ghost
[1:22:46] it'll change you
[1:22:48] right
[1:22:49] when you come in contact with the
[1:22:51] redeemer it changes who you are
[1:22:55] it's going to functionally change you
[1:22:56] and you're not going to express the same
[1:22:58] toxic
[1:23:00] attitude that you have what it will do
[1:23:02] is it will restructure you
[1:23:04] into something useful
[1:23:06] look at
[1:23:08] peter
[1:23:10] peter
[1:23:11] tried to hack a dude's head off he got
[1:23:13] his ear
[1:23:14] but they wouldn't go for the ear
[1:23:16] right
[1:23:18] and then a little while later he comes
[1:23:21] in f in contact with some fire and now
[1:23:23] he's preaching
[1:23:24] you know these men are not drunk like
[1:23:25] you supposed he's got all this fireball
[1:23:27] courage
[1:23:28] where do you think that came from not
[1:23:29] all the disciples were out there
[1:23:31] preaching like that
[1:23:32] okay what was it peter had this this
[1:23:36] drive this go get it we're gonna just go
[1:23:38] do it before it expressed in a toxic way
[1:23:43] and then he gets the holy ghost and
[1:23:44] expresses in a holy way
[1:23:47] okay
[1:23:50] now
[1:23:52] it still kind of begs the question
[1:23:55] what's the point of all this
[1:23:58] because you can say
[1:24:00] well god has a plan for us and he wants
[1:24:03] us to do all this stuff but it still
[1:24:04] seems kind of unfair that he would make
[1:24:05] us toxic and hurt all these people and
[1:24:07] then make us go through an oven and
[1:24:08] suffer to fix it
[1:24:11] he made it this way and then he's gonna
[1:24:12] make a suffer to fix it what in the
[1:24:13] world what is the what could possibly be
[1:24:15] so important
[1:24:17] that i have to go through all of this
[1:24:20] well remember i said this stuff was
[1:24:22] called piezo electric
[1:24:25] now
[1:24:26] i want to read to you
[1:24:28] the
[1:24:29] um
[1:24:30] scroll up here this is um
[1:24:34] this is from the very uh uh credible
[1:24:36] source wikipedia um
[1:24:39] but i can assure you this is accurate
[1:24:40] because i worked in this field okay um
[1:24:44] uh piezoelectricity is the electric
[1:24:47] charge that accumulates in certain solid
[1:24:50] materials such as crystals certain
[1:24:52] ceramics and
[1:24:54] i didn't know this by the way until i
[1:24:55] read this um and biological matter such
[1:24:59] as bone dna and virus proteins
[1:25:04] in response to applied mechanical stress
[1:25:07] the uh
[1:25:09] what hang on
[1:25:11] oh dear
[1:25:13] oh no my my quotation got messed up
[1:25:16] um
[1:25:19] anyways upshot is um if you squeeze this
[1:25:22] stuff in the right way
[1:25:23] it generates electricity
[1:25:26] okay the point of all of this
[1:25:29] the point of the heat and the pressure
[1:25:32] and the and the the molding hydraulic
[1:25:35] press and then all the fire and all the
[1:25:37] lead and all of it is so that that oh by
[1:25:39] the way in there also it gets coated in
[1:25:41] gold um just saying um
[1:25:45] after after the fire by the way you
[1:25:47] don't get that until after you get the
[1:25:48] holy ghost um
[1:25:50] the uh
[1:25:52] the
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:25:53] is coated in gold
[1:25:55] and then
[1:25:56] the purpose of it is so that when they
[1:25:58] put pressure on it
[1:26:00] it just manifests power
[1:26:02] power just comes out of it
[1:26:04] right that's
[1:26:06] what the purpose of all of this is
[1:26:08] there's going to be a time when you're
[1:26:10] going to come under pressure
[1:26:12] right
[1:26:14] and you're going to manifest power
[1:26:17] because it's what's in you it's the
[1:26:19] logos in you it's the purpose it's the
[1:26:21] program that was programmed into you
[1:26:25] that when you come under pressure when
[1:26:29] when the bills get really tight because
[1:26:31] you decided to pay your tithes
[1:26:36] you're going to come under pressure
[1:26:39] and then power's going to come out of
[1:26:41] you
[1:26:42] and that power is going to be jehovah
[1:26:45] jireh the provider and you're going to
[1:26:47] manifest jehovah jireh in that moment
[1:26:50] right why that's the power that's in
[1:26:53] that all of that process decided to or
[1:26:56] all that process was there to culminate
[1:27:00] in
[1:27:02] in that you would be um
[1:27:05] in that
[1:27:06] you would manifest this power uh
[1:27:09] at the crucial moment right we can see
[1:27:12] this with david
[1:27:14] david
[1:27:15] spends his
[1:27:17] all of his life with all the suffering
[1:27:18] and things right you wonder why why did
[1:27:21] david get chased around the desert by
[1:27:23] paul by saul rather
[1:27:26] he's anointed king he has a promise why
[1:27:29] didn't he be like well it's my promise
[1:27:31] it's my right i'm just gonna go kill
[1:27:33] this guy and be king
[1:27:34] right he had more than enough
[1:27:35] opportunity to do it
[1:27:36] why was it that
[1:27:38] god inspired him to go suffer in the
[1:27:41] desert and get chased around
[1:27:43] for all this time because he's preparing
[1:27:45] him for something
[1:27:46] one day in the future
[1:27:48] david
[1:27:50] is going to suffer the consequences of
[1:27:52] his own actions
[1:27:54] and be deposed by his own son and he's
[1:27:56] going to have to go run for his life in
[1:27:58] the
[1:27:58] desert right
[1:28:01] absalom has him on the run
[1:28:04] and in that amount of time all that
[1:28:06] suffering
[1:28:07] here's david
[1:28:10] after going through all this this fire
[1:28:12] and all the stuff he's now at a point
[1:28:15] where he can walk up the mount of olives
[1:28:18] and weep and foreshadow christ
[1:28:21] amen right
[1:28:24] and that's the point
[1:28:27] that's why we go through all of this
[1:28:28] stuff
[1:28:29] that's why we have to go get cooked and
[1:28:30] get all the stuff that isn't good burnt
[1:28:32] out of us and all the toxic nonsense
[1:28:36] cooked out of us so that there will come
[1:28:38] a point
[1:28:41] when
[1:28:42] the squeeze comes down
[1:28:44] and you manifest
[1:28:47] the program that built you amen
[1:28:51] right
[1:29:04] and um
[1:29:06] i just uh
[1:29:08] i don't know why this just came on my
[1:29:09] heart um this isn't really in my notes
[1:29:10] but it kind of came in my head just now
[1:29:13] um
[1:29:14] one of the interesting things that i saw
[1:29:16] that i noticed with david is here he
[1:29:18] goes through all this this struggle
[1:29:20] right he finally gets to the point where
[1:29:21] he can manifest christ he's walking up
[1:29:23] the hill he's ex he's extending christ
[1:29:26] to his own son
[1:29:27] who has rejected him
[1:29:29] and
[1:29:31] he's forgiving this boy and he he goes
[1:29:35] and they're about to have the great
[1:29:36] battle and he tells his generals don't
[1:29:38] hurt this
[1:29:39] boy don't do it
[1:29:40] right go easy on him
[1:29:43] because david is looking at this with
[1:29:45] the with
[1:29:46] the way christ would look at it it was
[1:29:48] unfair i got rejected when i didn't
[1:29:50] deserve it
[1:29:51] and
[1:29:52] now but i'm gonna forgive him anyways i
[1:29:54] will i will reconcile i will redeem my
[1:29:56] son
[1:29:58] and he finally gets to this point
[1:30:00] and then
[1:30:02] some
[1:30:03] other
[1:30:04] person
[1:30:05] swoops in and executes absalom
[1:30:08] when absalom is hanging in a tree from
[1:30:10] his hair
[1:30:12] now i don't know why this came on my
[1:30:14] heart but what i do know
[1:30:15] is that
[1:30:17] it seems to me
[1:30:19] like a lot of times parents will have
[1:30:21] their kids they will go through a lot of
[1:30:23] trouble right absalom or you know
[1:30:25] parents the reason why
[1:30:28] parents have the kids that they do
[1:30:30] right remember god if you god picked you
[1:30:33] to have those kids and kids god picked
[1:30:35] those parents for you
[1:30:37] right
[1:30:38] you you're pre-planned to back to many
[1:30:40] generations don't be so bitter at your
[1:30:42] parents first of all
[1:30:43] because they know they probably have
[1:30:45] gone through a lot the struggles a lot
[1:30:47] closer to what to you than what you
[1:30:49] think right because they have the same
[1:30:50] genetics you're probably predisposed to
[1:30:52] have a lot of the same struggles
[1:30:54] right
[1:30:55] not only that but parents are going to
[1:30:57] be a lot closer to that that teenagers
[1:31:00] or that child struggle than a lot of
[1:31:02] people might think because they have the
[1:31:04] same genetics
[1:31:06] right
[1:31:07] those parents are the best possible
[1:31:09] people
[1:31:10] to help that child when they're in a
[1:31:13] rebellious
[1:31:14] position
[1:31:15] and so
[1:31:16] finally when parents will finally get to
[1:31:18] the point where this their kid is
[1:31:21] finally he they've rebelled but they're
[1:31:23] finally at a point where they could
[1:31:24] reach out they're helpless all their
[1:31:25] defenses are down absalom has he lost
[1:31:27] the battle he's hanging from a tree by a
[1:31:29] haircut
[1:31:32] and here comes some other adult to
[1:31:33] execute him
[1:31:36] when david was like no bring him back if
[1:31:38] you just get him to me
[1:31:40] i'll be able to fix it
[1:31:42] i'll be able to manifest christ to him
[1:31:45] so i guess what i'm going for here is a
[1:31:48] lot of times we might see teenagers who
[1:31:51] are struggling
[1:31:52] who are who did a lot of rebellious
[1:31:55] nonsense
[1:31:56] and they went through some really
[1:31:58] bad times but when you finally see them
[1:32:01] just because they're hung up on a
[1:32:03] haircut
[1:32:04] or
[1:32:05] some small thing leave them alone get
[1:32:07] them let their parents reconcile with
[1:32:09] them don't just go in there i'm like
[1:32:11] well i'll tell this boy what what for
[1:32:14] right
[1:32:15] why
[1:32:16] right
[1:32:19] that's not in my notes that's free um
[1:32:21] so
[1:32:22] um
[1:32:24] amy how
[1:32:27] um
[1:32:28] so and i guess i'll end on this
[1:32:31] there is one other property of
[1:32:34] that piezoelectric ceramic that is
[1:32:37] really interesting
[1:32:39] so the same science and the same math
[1:32:41] equations that say that if you
[1:32:44] twist that ceramic a little bit it'll
[1:32:46] generate electricity
[1:32:48] also says
[1:32:50] that if you apply electricity to it
[1:32:52] it'll twist
[1:32:56] so
[1:32:56] the other purpose that god
[1:32:59] the other thing that god is trying to
[1:33:00] accomplish with your life
[1:33:02] is that
[1:33:03] when you come in the presence of power
[1:33:07] you move
[1:33:09] right
[1:33:10] you jump up and down and you shout and
[1:33:12] you praise the lord or maybe you're in a
[1:33:14] situation where someone needs to act
[1:33:17] and the power will follow you in that
[1:33:19] moment and then you will you will move
[1:33:21] and you will act and you will accomplish
[1:33:22] exactly what god needed you to
[1:33:24] accomplish
[1:33:25] right
[1:33:26] it goes both ways
[1:33:29] so
[1:33:31] i i guess usually people tell you the
[1:33:33] title at the beginning i will tell you
[1:33:35] the title now
[1:33:37] the title of this of this service was
[1:33:40] that the name of the lord or the the uh
[1:33:44] what did i title it
[1:33:51] yeah you're right you're absolutely
[1:33:52] right and i would have remembered
[1:33:53] anyways
[1:33:56] what was it
[1:33:57] treasure and earth and vessels
[1:34:00] we have
[1:34:02] a treasure in our in earth and vessels
[1:34:04] it's the power the logos that god has
[1:34:05] put in you it is the programming that
[1:34:07] god has built into you
[1:34:09] that when you come under pressure you're
[1:34:12] going to manifest
[1:34:14] something beautiful and something
[1:34:15] powerful and going back to and just just
[1:34:20] hit that one last point that when
[1:34:22] abraham and sarah got their name changed
[1:34:24] they manifested a body change and
[1:34:26] there's gonna come a day that the
[1:34:27] it feels like we're in a dark age things
[1:34:29] are getting really tight things are
[1:34:30] getting really pressurized
[1:34:33] but you're going to come under pressure
[1:34:34] and you're going to manifest
[1:34:36] something that's going to just blow you
[1:34:37] out of this world
[1:34:39] so that's it we'll call the musicians
[1:34:41] back up
[1:34:50] um
[1:34:51] i want to sing um that song what did i
[1:34:53] come out on um
[1:34:56] how great is our god
[1:34:58] i was really liking that and i want to
[1:34:59] sing it some more
[1:35:05] how great
[1:35:08] is
[1:35:11] [Music]
[1:35:15] great is
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:41] sing with me how great
[1:35:45] is
[1:35:56] is
[1:35:59] [Applause]
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:11] is
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:24] is
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:52] is
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:03] [Applause]
[1:37:10] is
[1:37:25] let's lift our hands
[1:37:43] my
[1:37:55] hallelujah
[1:37:58] thank you lord jesus
[1:38:00] amen
[1:38:02] praise the lord you appreciate the word
[1:38:05] amen appreciate that brother matthew i
[1:38:07] think man i would have never known that
[1:38:09] was his first sermon here at this church
[1:38:12] uh you'd have never known it
[1:38:14] amen lourdes really i really appreciated
[1:38:16] that he was just able to be matthew
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:20] and you know that's what our was we were
[1:38:23] i was so myself just so um
[1:38:27] shocked by when he uh spoke just for our
[1:38:30] young people and i just mean that
[1:38:32] because
[1:38:33] um he he just be was himself and he just
[1:38:37] began to speak just like he did here
[1:38:39] tonight very similar and man
[1:38:43] after just a few minutes i don't think
[1:38:45] there was anybody that wasn't just right
[1:38:47] in tune with what he had to say the lord
[1:38:49] gifted him put it i love how he said
[1:38:52] that that he'll never be you know he'll
[1:38:54] never you're not even gonna be his dad
[1:38:56] he'll be matthew and appreciated that
[1:38:59] we've seen that here tonight the lord
[1:39:00] could just use a thought that god placed
[1:39:03] upon his heart treasure and earth and
[1:39:05] vessels
[1:39:06] amen and i'm certainly grateful that the
[1:39:08] lord could take our is amazing how well
[1:39:11] that tied in with brother diggs that the
[1:39:13] lord could take something that could
[1:39:15] seem so negative even your own genes
[1:39:18] your own genetics and ways that you were
[1:39:20] made he talked about his temper and uh
[1:39:23] gotta be careful they're talking about
[1:39:24] grandma she's probably streaming here
[1:39:26] tonight but um
[1:39:28] sister dorothy we love you
[1:39:31] we really do god bless you
[1:39:33] and we love uh
[1:39:34] we love who you are now and who you were
[1:39:36] before and and then you're a daughter of
[1:39:38] god amen appreciate that brother matthew
[1:39:41] that was good it was really good it was
[1:39:43] amazing because i was reading just here
[1:39:45] uh ministering in washington just a
[1:39:47] couple just a week ago i guess it was
[1:39:49] and i was preaching taking uh brother
[1:39:52] branham when he talks about that young
[1:39:53] man who was going to get married had a
[1:39:56] fiancee i think it was it was brother
[1:39:57] branham's nephew and he starts the
[1:40:00] mother and the father approach him and
[1:40:01] say you know he's got this issue he
[1:40:03] won't forgive her and then brother
[1:40:05] branham just starts looking into her
[1:40:07] he's speaking speaking to the mom of the
[1:40:09] boy and then the dad and he starts
[1:40:11] looking and he says look at your family
[1:40:13] and he points to the mother and it says
[1:40:16] you know your family was germans they're

[1:40:31] me and he said that's how that's how you
[1:40:33] were he said that's how your people are
[1:40:35] so they're real they hold grudges he
[1:40:37] said they can't ask for forgiveness
[1:40:40] and then he looks at the father he says
[1:40:41] look at your family brother branham's
[1:40:43] actually talking about his own his own
[1:40:45] family and he says they're what are they
