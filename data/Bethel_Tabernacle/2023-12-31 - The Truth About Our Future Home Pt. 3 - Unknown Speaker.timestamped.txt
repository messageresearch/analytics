[5:28] continue
[5:58] father
[6:22] amen God bless you can be
[6:24] seated if you want to bring up that
[6:26] PowerPoint for me
[6:28] please I think I had it ready on the
[6:30] page that I wanted it and it's up there
[6:33] the back back monitor is not
[6:41] on all
[6:43] right
[6:45] so I'm just going to get right into it
[6:48] this is sometimes people you'll see
[6:50] people say you know this is speaking
[6:53] about heaven isn't
[6:55] practical uh because it's getting our
[6:57] minds off of what's what is going on
[7:00] today or you know it's not present tense
[7:04] but I think that that's a that's an
[7:07] error that's a mistake to think of
[7:10] teaching on and meditating on Heaven uh
[7:14] and and we'll see that why in in CS
[7:16] Lewis Mere Christianity he says a
[7:19] continually looking forward to the
[7:21] Eternal world is not as some Modern
[7:23] people think a form of escapism or
[7:25] wishful thinking but one of the things a
[7:27] Christian is meant to do it does not
[7:29] mean that we are to leave the present
[7:31] worlds as it is if you read history
[7:34] you'll find that the Christians who did
[7:35] most for the present world were just
[7:37] those who thought most of the next the
[7:39] apostles themselves who set foot the
[7:42] conversion of the Roman Empire the Great
[7:43] Men Who Built up the Middle Ages the
[7:46] English evangelicals who abolished the
[7:48] slave trade all left their mark on Earth
[7:51] precisely because their minds were
[7:53] occupied with Heaven it is since
[7:56] Christians have largely ceased to think
[7:58] of the other world that they have become
[8:00] so ineffective in this aim at heaven and
[8:03] you'll get Earth thrown in AIM at Earth
[8:05] and you'll get
[8:06] neither and that's what the scripture
[8:08] tells us set your affection your desires
[8:12] your passion your vision for Life set
[8:14] your affection on things that are above
[8:17] not on things that are on the
[8:20] earth and and I believe this is a
[8:22] critical thing and and critical to us to
[8:25] be balanced Christians is to understand
[8:29] that this is not our home that we're not
[8:32] citizens of America merely but that our
[8:35] citizenship is in heaven from whence we
[8:38] look for a savior you know we're
[8:40] supposed to look forward with joy with
[8:44] hope for our future this world I mean
[8:48] there's not a lot of Hope in it and it's
[8:50] getting worse and worse and worse is it
[8:52] so cold in here that my hands feel
[8:56] numb I must be becoming a southerner so
[8:59] I know brother Mark's working on on
[9:01] getting things fixed so we'll just pray
[9:03] for
[9:04] him amen
[9:07] so you know our our mind needs to have
[9:12] that Focus if we lose that focus and
[9:15] that hope for our future State and our
[9:19] future home we lose many things along
[9:22] with that and are that's why people
[9:25] become so entrenched in this world and
[9:28] the World system and politics and they
[9:31] get pulled aside into things that don't
[9:33] mean very much really and you know it's
[9:37] it's so easy to get caught up in it
[9:39] because there's so much evil and and we
[9:42] know the truth and we know what's good
[9:43] and what's right but the reality is you
[9:46] never affect if you want to affect
[9:48] change in the world you don't do it by
[9:50] responding directly to the devil you do
[9:52] it by doing what God has called you to
[9:54] do so if you want to change the world we
[9:57] don't engage directly in politics to
[10:00] change the world we preach the
[10:02] gospel and we love as an individual we
[10:05] love people we love it's you and your
[10:08] home and your family and the Small
[10:10] Things loving loving your neighbor
[10:13] loving the person that's unlovable
[10:15] reaching out to people that's the that's
[10:18] the thing that changes a neighborhood a
[10:23] a a City a state a country the world is
[10:27] when you yourself do the very small
[10:31] things that God is asking you to do to
[10:32] love your neighbor as
[10:35] yourself and without a vision from God
[10:39] of our future we will be very
[10:42] ineffective at doing that because the
[10:43] whole world is against us the whole
[10:45] world hates us and you have to
[10:48] understand that it might cost you doing
[10:49] the small thing of love it might cost
[10:52] you your life maybe not in Buford South
[10:56] Carolina but in places in the world it
[10:58] may do that so without a vision of what
[11:01] God has for us that this is just
[11:03] temporary this is this this isn't our
[11:06] Eternal
[11:08] home this this is a temporary
[11:12] condition soon we'll be in a body that's
[11:15] impervious to pain and can't be broken
[11:18] can't be
[11:22] hurt this is a
[11:24] temporary amen all right let's look at
[11:27] uh revelation oh before we do that I
[11:31] want to look at this I hope you could
[11:33] see that okay just looking at the future
[11:36] home timeline so you have in the
[11:38] beginning God created the heavens and
[11:40] the Earth right Paradise begins on
[11:45] Earth and if if we look at that and we
[11:47] remember even even in this place God
[11:50] gave them a test and gave them a testing
[11:53] and it was always God's purpose even in
[11:57] the original Paradise for there to be a
[11:59] test
[12:00] well the test came and they failed the
[12:03] test they sinned and this put the whole
[12:06] creation into corruption into the
[12:09] bondage of corruption and under the
[12:11] effects of sin so when that
[12:15] happens Paradise is
[12:18] lost now there comes a separation if you
[12:22] need to stand up and do jumping jacks
[12:23] feel free I won't be
[12:26] offended Paradise is lost
[12:29] this is when what what I would just I'm
[12:31] terming as intermediate Heaven
[12:35] begins it's not not any necessarily
[12:38] doctrinal term but I would just look at
[12:40] it as an intermediate heaven so what
[12:42] happens is Heaven and Earth were once
[12:44] one Earth was Paradise when the fall
[12:48] happened this was separated we we don't
[12:51] have act we don't see in that Dimension
[12:53] anymore that's over with that's ended so
[12:56] that's there's a separation and we'll
[12:58] get we'll get into that this Earth is
[13:01] merely a shadow of that world right so
[13:05] if we know what this Earth is like as a
[13:07] shadow then we know what that place is
[13:09] like over there so that is separated
[13:13] now now now there's a Plan of Redemption
[13:16] immediately he says there's going to be
[13:17] a seed of the woman that crushes the
[13:20] head of the serpent amen and so God sets
[13:24] forth to bring forth his Plan of
[13:26] Redemption to not only redeem
[13:29] his creation on the Earth but to redeem
[13:31] his Earth as well this intermediate
[13:35] Heaven actually was in the heart of the
[13:38] earth before the resurrection of Christ
[13:41] when a righteous person died they went
[13:43] to the Grave or sheld or whatever you
[13:46] want to call it which was two
[13:48] compartments one was torment and one was
[13:52] Abraham's
[13:53] bosom or Paradise is another way Jesus
[13:57] says today you'll be with me in Paradise
[14:00] that was in the heart of the
[14:02] Earth when the resurrection happened
[14:04] Christ brought the righteous Saints out
[14:06] of that paradise that was in the heart
[14:09] of the earth emptied out and was brought
[14:12] into Heavenly places a little closer to
[14:16] the presence of God there because of the
[14:19] blood of Jesus Christ before that they
[14:20] had to go to the heart of the earth why
[14:22] their sins were merely covered the blood
[14:25] of bull it's impossible for the blood of
[14:26] bulls and goats to take away sins so
[14:29] they merely covered and pushed it
[14:30] forward until the perfect sacrifice
[14:32] could come that his sacrifice could be
[14:35] made the blood could be shed and then
[14:36] his life could come back upon the
[14:39] worshipper the life of a blood and Bulls
[14:41] and bulls and goats they couldn't come
[14:43] back on the worshipper because it wasn't
[14:45] the same life but now it's the very life
[14:48] of God in the man Christ Jesus that Holy
[14:53] Spirit comes back upon us and
[14:55] accomplishes perfect Redemption for the
[14:58] the inner man amen coming soon coming
[15:03] soon to to the Earth near you the
[15:06] Millennium that's the reign of Christ
[15:08] and the Saints on Earth over the Nations
[15:12] thousand years later what happens Satan
[15:15] is let out gathers together the Nations
[15:18] to fight against them fire comes from
[15:20] Heaven the white Throne comes then what
[15:24] do we have the intermediate Heaven
[15:27] actually comes to an end why does it
[15:29] come to an end it doesn't come to an end
[15:32] it comes back to its beginning Heaven
[15:35] and Earth are joined back together not
[15:38] in the
[15:39] Millennium but on the new Heaven and the
[15:42] new Earth when the New Jerusalem comes
[15:45] down from God out of Heaven to make that
[15:50] that Abode there on Earth then there's
[15:53] no more intermediate Heaven All Is One
[15:56] God will be all in all that doesn't mean
[15:58] mean like the Hindus believe that
[16:00] everything is God no what it is is that
[16:03] everything now be is into that place
[16:06] where it is an expression of God all of
[16:10] God's attributes are on display in full
[16:13] maturity in the new Heaven and the new
[16:16] Earth amen all right so Revelation
[16:20] 7:9 let look a little bit more I think
[16:23] many times as I as I started this we
[16:25] look
[16:27] at
[16:30] what we see depicted in you know
[16:34] cartoons and movies and it's sort of
[16:37] this this white dry sterile Place boring
[16:43] that's not what heaven is like at all
[16:46] and we have to get that picture out of
[16:47] our minds that is not at all what heaven
[16:51] is like this this Earth is a reflection
[16:55] of that if that's the case then what is
[16:57] heaven where do we go and is it just a
[17:01] just a flat plain place no it's a place
[17:05] bursting with
[17:07] life after this I behold in low a great
[17:09] multitude which no man could number of
[17:11] all Nations and kindreds of people and
[17:13] tongues stood Before the Throne and
[17:15] before the lamb clothed with right white
[17:16] robes and Palms in their hands where
[17:20] where do Palms come
[17:22] from Palm Trees so evidently there's
[17:25] trees in heaven which is exactly what
[17:27] brother brandham tells us you see a tree
[17:30] dying here means that there's another
[17:33] Tree on the other side that isn't dying
[17:35] it's hard for us to comprehend but
[17:38] remember everything here is a
[17:40] shadow of what's over
[17:42] there 2 Kings
[17:44] 211 came to pass as they still went on
[17:47] and talked that behold there appeared a
[17:48] chariot of fire and Horses of fire and
[17:51] part of them both of sunder and Elijah
[17:52] went up by a whirlwind into heaven well
[17:55] you could say this is merely just a
[17:56] supernatural thing well well a chariot
[18:00] of fire and Horses of fire came out of
[18:01] heaven and we have a precedent for that
[18:03] as well in Revelation 17 so there's
[18:06] chariots and there's horses in
[18:09] heaven Revelation 1911 I saw heaven
[18:11] opened and behold a white horse and he
[18:13] that sat upon him was called faithful
[18:15] and true and in righteousness he doth
[18:17] judge and make war his eyes were as a
[18:20] flame of fire and on his head were many
[18:21] crowns and he had a name written that no
[18:23] man knew but he himself and he was
[18:25] clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood
[18:27] and his name is called the word of God
[18:29] God and the armies which were in heaven
[18:31] followed him upon white horses clothed
[18:33] in fine linen white and clean so there
[18:37] they are there's horses in heaven
[18:40] there's animals in heaven we can we can
[18:43] take from this this is not just horses
[18:45] in heaven there's other animals in
[18:47] heaven if you as we get further we won't
[18:50] get to it this time but as we get
[18:52] further you'll see brother brandham in
[18:54] the intermediate Heaven his dog runs up
[18:56] to him his horse
[18:59] runs up to
[19:01] him Hebrews
[19:04] 8:5 who serve unto the example and
[19:06] Shadow of heavy Heavenly things as Moses
[19:09] was admonished of God when he is about
[19:11] to make the Tabernacle for see saith he
[19:13] that thou make all things according to
[19:15] the pattern showed thee in the mount so
[19:18] he went up to the mountain and there was
[19:20] a pattern shown him so he was Heaven was
[19:22] opened up to Moses and he saw what
[19:25] heaven was like and God said make the
[19:28] Tabernacle just like the one you saw in
[19:32] heaven Hebrews 9:11 but Christ being
[19:35] come and high priest of good things to
[19:37] come by a greater and more perfect
[19:39] Tabernacle not made with hands that is
[19:41] to say not of this
[19:44] building and then verse 24 for Christ
[19:47] has not entered into the holy places
[19:48] made with hands which are the figures of
[19:51] the true but into heaven itself now to
[19:54] appear in the presence of God for us
[19:58] all right so as we as we look at this
[20:01] and we see this we see there's a that
[20:04] heaven is the
[20:06] substance if you think about that he
[20:09] what what is in heaven is more real than
[20:12] what is here on Earth not to us we can't
[20:15] fathom
[20:16] that I can't I can explain that to you
[20:19] logically for you to understand that
[20:22] because this is all that we know but
[20:25] we're just the creatures of this
[20:27] dimension
[20:28] I it's very difficult to even try to
[20:31] attempt to explain it brother brandom
[20:33] says it's traveling F it's moving faster
[20:36] well what does that mean it's moving
[20:38] faster right well we're going to catch
[20:40] up to it well
[20:42] okay explain that to me in in detail
[20:46] right that we we can't because it's
[20:48] right here it's not low as we're chasing
[20:50] it through right but it's right here
[20:53] it's just it's uh what do you say it's
[20:56] megahertz are faster than here I don't
[20:59] know there's something beyond that that
[21:03] when we get there we'll be able to
[21:05] understand it but here we just believe
[21:07] it's by faith we see and we understand
[21:10] these things from the word and we just
[21:12] say amen that's what the word
[21:15] says Hebrews
[21:18] 12:22 but you are come unto Mount Zion
[21:21] and unto the city of the Living God the
[21:23] heavenly Jerusalem and into two and a
[21:27] numerable company of
[21:30] angels okay when am I come under that
[21:34] when
[21:35] now now it's not as though this is just
[21:40] speaking of something future right there
[21:43] is a Heavenly Jerusalem now there is a
[21:46] Heavenly T Tabernacle now there is a
[21:48] city of the Living God it's right near
[21:51] us it's right around us you are already
[21:55] in this moment when you walk by faith
[21:58] you are come to an innumerable company
[22:00] of angels you're come to Mount Zion
[22:03] where is it it's just a little bit
[22:05] faster you can't see it now but one day
[22:08] you will in things that are to be
[22:11] brother Bram speaks about that he says
[22:13] now we know that Moses in building the
[22:16] Tabernacle in the wilderness or
[22:17] preparing it he said he made all things
[22:19] after the order of what he saw in heaven
[22:21] see so the Earthly things only express
[22:24] what the Eternal things are and if this
[22:27] Earth that we live in today being so
[22:29] great as we love it and love to live and
[22:31] breathe the air and see the flowers and
[22:33] things if that if this here is the
[22:37] expression one that's dying is only
[22:39] expressing one that's Eternal when you
[22:41] see a tree struggling pulling trying to
[22:43] live that means there's a tree somewhere
[22:45] that doesn't have to do that when you
[22:46] see a man here struggling to live
[22:49] somebody in a hospital
[22:52] um struggling and the death rattles is
[22:54] in their throat and pulling and crying
[22:56] and screaming for Life what does that
[22:57] mean there's a place somewhere there's a
[22:59] body that doesn't struggle and scream
[23:02] for that see it just doesn't do
[23:05] it and as we read before Jesus said unto
[23:08] him verily the thief on the cross verily
[23:10] I say unto thee today Thou shalt be with
[23:13] me in
[23:14] Paradise we look at this word
[23:17] Paradise this is the theer definition
[23:20] among the Persians a grand and closure
[23:22] or preserve Hunting Ground Park shady
[23:24] and well watered which wild animals were
[23:27] kept for the hunt it was enclosed by
[23:28] walls and furnished with towers for the
[23:31] hunters a garden a pleasure ground again
[23:33] Jesus uses this term when he speaks to
[23:36] the thief on the cross you'll be with me
[23:39] even in the he the the paradise that was
[23:42] in the heart of the earth it wasn't just
[23:46] some clean room it was a you you explain
[23:50] it to me I can't explain it but he
[23:53] refers to it as a paradise it's a
[23:56] pleasure ground it's a place you know a
[23:58] garden is a place that someone designs
[24:01] right they take time to design it put it
[24:04] in order make it look beautiful make it
[24:06] look enjoyable and this is what heaven
[24:10] is liken unto a paradise so this idea
[24:13] that that it's some boring place is just
[24:18] totally unscriptural I believe it's an
[24:20] invention of
[24:21] Satan to make it seem like it's a boring
[24:24] place it's not a boring place it's a
[24:26] beautiful place it's you know you think
[24:28] you you know you go to the beach or you
[24:30] go to some tropical place or into the
[24:32] mountains and you're a struck by it
[24:35] right it's amazing and you wish that
[24:37] that experience would never end well it
[24:39] does it always does but in in
[24:44] heaven even right now not just the not
[24:47] not just the Eternal age of the new
[24:51] Heaven and the new Earth but even right
[24:53] now Heaven is so much more beautiful and
[24:56] Grand than than what we can even
[25:02] imagine par you know Paradise let's look
[25:05] at this a little bit more Paradise
[25:07] doesn't refer to a wild place right it
[25:11] refers to a place man was put in the
[25:14] garden right to keep it to dress it and
[25:17] to keep it so there God created it God
[25:20] set it up God constituted it God founded
[25:23] it but he put man there to take care of
[25:26] it see
[25:28] and so I think that's the same picture
[25:30] that we have of Heaven it's an orderly
[25:33] place that that is set up that man is
[25:36] there to tend it see you think we're
[25:39] going to a place and we're just going to
[25:41] rest and and and do nothing no that's
[25:46] not what brother brandham taught us
[25:48] we're going to live we're going to
[25:50] work we're going to real
[25:54] life all
[25:56] right
[25:59] Alistair McGrath says the idea of a
[26:01] Walled Garden enclosing a carefully
[26:03] cultivated area of Exquisite plants and
[26:05] animals was the most powerful symbol of
[26:08] paradise available to the human
[26:10] imagination mingling the images of the
[26:13] beauty of nature with the orderliness of
[26:15] human construction the whole of human
[26:17] history is thus enfolded in the subtle
[26:19] interplay of Sorrow over Lost Paradise
[26:22] and the hope of its final
[26:25] restoration this this reflects even what
[26:28] brother brandham says in the sermon
[26:30] super sign said neb Nebuchadnezzar built
[26:33] a super City it had Hanging Gardens and
[26:34] it was a great place it was a pattern of
[26:37] Heaven think of that a pagan
[26:40] King builds a beautiful walled City with
[26:44] Incredible Gardens they say it was one
[26:45] of the Wonders of the Ancient Ancient
[26:48] Earth and brother Bram himself says see
[26:51] it was a pattern of heaven right before
[26:54] the throne flowed the river Euphrates
[26:56] and they find out that that's the the
[26:57] way the Throne of God the River of Life
[27:00] by The Throne of God is so again I
[27:05] encourage you if you don't catch
[27:08] anything out of this today catch this
[27:11] and that's that heaven that you're going
[27:13] to is an
[27:15] incredible
[27:16] beautiful place filled with excitement
[27:20] joy in a place where we can really be
[27:24] who God made us to be without any
[27:26] hindrance from the
[27:28] devil nevertheless we also understand
[27:31] that the intermediate heaven isn't our
[27:34] permanent home our permanent home is
[27:37] here on Earth when Heaven and Earth
[27:39] become one again back to God's original
[27:43] creation only Satan has been defeated
[27:46] and destroyed and he'll be annihilated
[27:49] for for all of eternity never to bother
[27:52] us again in the intermediate Heaven
[27:55] though we long for the fulfill
[27:57] fulfillment of God's word amen look at
[28:01] the the Jewish Saints who were martyred
[28:04] their their they praying and asking God
[28:06] while they're in heaven how long do we
[28:09] have to wait until you fulfill your word
[28:12] in bringing Vengeance on those who
[28:14] destroyed us even the bride who's there
[28:18] is waiting and rejoicing
[28:21] when bab mystery Babylon is destroyed
[28:25] see and they're rejoicing they're desire
[28:28] is not just to remain in the
[28:29] intermediate heaven but their desire is
[28:32] for the word of God to be completely
[28:35] fulfilled right your desire to see the
[28:38] word of God completely fulfilled it
[28:40] won't change when you go to the
[28:42] intermediate heaven when you go there
[28:45] you certainly will have that desire more
[28:48] and it will be even greater and that's
[28:51] the source of of our prayers when we're
[28:55] there I mean you say you're going
[28:59] to we will because the Saints in the
[29:02] Bible that were in heaven were praying
[29:05] for God to bring his word to pass amen
[29:08] and we know that there's also a cloud of
[29:10] witnesses that right now is watching us
[29:13] and cheering us on and no doubt praying
[29:16] now the dividing line is that's where
[29:18] the Catholics mix it up they say oh
[29:20] there's a cloud of witnesses therefore
[29:23] we should ask them to pray for us
[29:25] no that's spiritualism
[29:28] we don't we don't do that we pray we're
[29:32] taught by the Lord Jesus to pray to the
[29:34] father in the name of Jesus
[29:38] Christ Revelation
[29:41] 2:7 he that hath an ear let him hear
[29:44] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[29:47] to him that overcometh will I give to
[29:49] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[29:51] midst of the paradise of God I find this
[29:54] so amazing this verse because it's
[29:58] spoken as though it's present tense and
[30:00] it is present tense and under understand
[30:03] if you understand the true teaching
[30:06] about what happened in the Garden of
[30:07] Eden you'll understand that the two
[30:10] trees that stood in the midst of the
[30:12] garden were not literal trees they were
[30:15] figurative trees there's no trees that
[30:17] you can eat their fruit and it's going
[30:19] to produce give you eternal life or
[30:22] there's no fruit that you can eat that's
[30:24] going to cause you to realize that
[30:26] you're naked right and make you feel the
[30:29] sense of guilt no that that was a
[30:32] figurative tree that's a whole other
[30:34] teaching and and subject in itself but
[30:37] as we understand that it was a
[30:39] figurative tree then we can understand
[30:42] that when he when we eat if we if we're
[30:45] Overcomers the promise is you can eat of
[30:47] the Tree of Life which still is in the
[30:49] midst of the paradise of God so how is
[30:52] it still in the midst of the paradise of
[30:53] God well think about when the the fall
[30:55] came did God put a fence
[30:58] around um the Garden of Eden so that we
[31:01] couldn't get in and they he put a big
[31:03] old angel with a flaming sword and we if
[31:05] we find that place maybe it's in
[31:07] Antarctica that's why everybody's so
[31:08] scared of going to Antarctica is
[31:12] that there's a big Angel there guarding
[31:14] from going into the tree of life I don't
[31:16] believe that's right the the Garden of
[31:18] Eden was likely in the Middle East and
[31:22] no doubt connection to the promised land
[31:24] if the land is so important and God
[31:26] wants to bring restoration there no
[31:28] doubt there's some connection to the
[31:30] land but even that is another subject in
[31:33] itself but but there he he didn't place
[31:37] a fence around it with a big angel that
[31:39] we can all see and get afraid of to run
[31:42] away from what is it he took he
[31:45] separated Heaven and Earth he separated
[31:49] Paradise from Earth we don't have access
[31:52] to that Dimension anymore it's separated
[31:54] but if you're an overcomer you're going
[31:56] to eat of that that tree of life which
[31:58] is still it's still in the midst of the
[32:00] paradise of God so if it's a literal
[32:01] tree we should be able to find it and if
[32:04] we're Overcomers we'll get access to
[32:06] that tree no it's not a literal tree
[32:08] it's a it's obviously a figurative tree
[32:11] it's based on the promises that we're
[32:13] going to we will if we overcome we will
[32:16] be in the midst of the paradise of God
[32:20] feasting on his very life a part of his
[32:23] very life and that's critical to
[32:26] understand that se separation but the
[32:28] separation doesn't mean that that that
[32:30] that's going to stay cuz we understand
[32:32] the separ that be it becomes restored
[32:35] Paradise will be on Earth again
[32:39] everything that we've lost will be
[32:41] restored to us
[32:44] amen every tear that we have is stored
[32:48] in a bottle by the Lord
[32:52] Jesus and he is going to bring joy
[32:57] to those places where we've been hurt
[33:00] where we've been broken and all you know
[33:04] everything that quote unquote we've lost
[33:06] we haven't lost anything if you're a
[33:07] real believer you haven't lost one bit
[33:11] of it look at the visions that the lord
[33:13] gave brother brandham did he lose his
[33:18] wife
[33:19] hope no didn't lose her did he lose his
[33:25] daughter no
[33:27] he got her back in a multiplied an even
[33:29] better form did he lose his dog did he
[33:33] lose his horse did he lose his
[33:38] chair so how far do we want to
[33:41] go you know we we can go
[33:44] further uh did I lose my cabin when my
[33:47] family sold it just
[33:51] temporarily God has a promise those
[33:54] things that everything that you loved
[33:57] and that loved you will be your
[34:01] reward and again that I've said it
[34:04] before but that doesn't that doesn't
[34:05] bypass the new birth and salvation but
[34:08] those things that were special to you
[34:10] that got taken away and sometimes God
[34:13] not sometimes God allows those things to
[34:15] be taken away for a greater purpose that
[34:18] we don't understand and it breaks our
[34:20] heart it kills us but there's a greater
[34:23] purpose that he
[34:24] has and he's going to restore every back
[34:27] to it anyways you you feel like I feel
[34:30] like we lost that my life will never be
[34:32] the same because of that but that's not
[34:35] what God speaks over us that's not what
[34:37] God says over our lives God says I will
[34:41] restore amen let's stand and
[34:47] pray father we thank you so much for
[34:50] your goodness and mercy we thank you
[34:51] Lord your great love for us Lord that
[34:54] you promise those things that we lost
[34:57] that we feel like we lost that have
[34:59] broken our heart Lord you're going to
[35:01] give them all back to us Lord when we
[35:04] get to our
[35:05] reward what hope that we have what joy
[35:09] we have knowing Lord just we need to run
[35:13] this race with
[35:15] patience father you'll you'll make all
[35:17] wrongs right you'll set everything in
[35:21] perfect order Lord and it's all through
[35:24] the blood of Jesus Christ and his his
[35:27] power to subdue not just us but all
[35:32] things unto himself Lord we ask your
[35:35] blessing upon the worship upon the
[35:38] preaching of the word we ask that You'
