[11:27] you know and we that I don't have the
[11:30] quote here but you know we we can follow
[11:33] this seed line throughout the Bible
[11:35] right you know he talks about Abraham's
[11:37] seed that it would come down and that
[11:40] that God would choose
[11:43] Abraham
[11:44] to be begin building this the seed line
[11:48] in in the nation of Israel that it would
[11:51] you know come down through Seth and
[11:53] through through Mo through Noah and then
[11:55] through down to Abraham
[12:00] and I you know in thinking about that
[12:01] you know we I know this is kind of
[12:03] simplistic concept but you know so often
[12:07] times it is simple um you know the Bible
[12:10] says every seed would bring forth out
[12:11] for its own kind and that by your fruits
[12:13] you would know them the way you can tell
[12:17] that
[12:18] Abraham was the seed of God and was a
[12:20] child of God is because Abraham did what
[12:23] God did right if you take if you you
[12:26] know if
[12:27] if you tell hey I've got this really
[12:30] really bizarre chicken it doesn't seem
[12:33] to behave the way a chicken should
[12:35] behave it's really aggressive and VI
[12:37] aggressive and vicious and it's Giant
[12:40] and it doesn't look like a chicken but I
[12:42] found it in the
[12:44] barnyard and we go over there and it's
[12:46] this giant you know wingspan six feet
[12:49] wide Brown feathers white head 4 inch
[12:52] hook Beacon massive Talons I'm going to
[12:54] go sorry dude that's not a chicken
[12:56] that's a bald eagle I don't care what
[12:58] Barnyard you got out of that's not a
[13:01] chicken right and you know if if if we
[13:05] have an orchard and we plant an orchard
[13:07] we have a hundred pear seeds and then
[13:10] one of our pear seeds Sprouts into a
[13:12] tree that grows apples I'm not going to
[13:15] say well this is some sort of par seed
[13:17] that mutated into an apple tree I'm say
[13:20] no someone at the packing plant mixed up
[13:22] and put a per an apple seed in there
[13:24] right the apple seed you know we can we
[13:28] can judge the what the thing is and what
[13:30] the origin of it is by what it
[13:33] produces so if the original if we can
[13:36] look back in the first thing the Bible
[13:38] says about God is that he spoke and
[13:41] brought forth and that he believed his
[13:43] own
[13:44] word right then the the marker of the
[13:47] children of God are going to be that
[13:49] they're going to believe his God's word
[13:51] too right that's the marker that's why
[13:53] when Abraham the Bible says that Abraham
[13:56] staggered not at the promise say that
[13:58] Abraham staggered not
[14:00] Abraham staggered plenty right there was
[14:02] a lot of times where Abraham fell flat
[14:04] on his
[14:05] face you know and it's and it's funny
[14:09] you know know especially in a talking
[14:13] about lineage and how you know the
[14:16] children do exactly what the father
[14:18] does you know Abraham goes and lies
[14:22] about Sarah being his sister or being
[14:24] his wife to AMC and then he has the son
[14:28] Isaac who then goes and lies about
[14:32] Rebecca being his wife to
[14:35] AMC and you know it's the it's the in
[14:38] the same thing and then and then Isaac's
[14:41] son Jacob first thing he does is he lies
[14:44] about who he is Dees his and calls
[14:47] himself his brother you know he's a liar
[14:50] and then then and then Jacob's son
[14:52] Joseph goes and lies to Pharaoh about
[14:55] what his family does for a living
[14:56] because he doesn't he's too ashamed to
[14:57] say that they're Shepherds
[14:59] so here we have a whole family of liars
[15:03] generation after generation after
[15:04] generation of people who are deceitful
[15:06] liars and God chose them right God chose
[15:11] them not because that they were perfect
[15:13] people not because that they would be
[15:16] you know Flawless or because that they
[15:18] wouldn't have massive personal
[15:22] failures you know in in some sense maybe
[15:25] he chose them because they would have
[15:27] personal failures right right because
[15:29] then maybe if they could recognize their
[15:31] own failure they could recognize that
[15:33] they needed God's help to begin with
[15:35] right Perfect People perfect people who
[15:37] don't think they have a problem are
[15:39] never going to reach out for help right
[15:43] you know that's the I know it it's kind
[15:46] of funny you know that's what they say
[15:48] the first step you know AA alcoholicas
[15:50] that's the first step of of getting
[15:52] better is that you admit that you got a
[15:53] problem right this is very simple and
[15:56] yet so many times people don't want to
[15:58] do that they want to look at their life
[15:59] and say I have a problem I'm clearly not
[16:02] aligned with the word of God they'll
[16:03] find every excuse as to
[16:05] why that they're okay they'll find every
[16:07] excuse as to why that doesn't apply to
[16:09] them or or why they're they're all right
[16:10] but they they don't recognize that they
[16:12] have a problem and so then they'll never
[16:15] get they'll never get saved they'll
[16:16] never get they'll never get delivered of
[16:18] of
[16:20] anything and so here's
[16:24] God you know and then it then it also
[16:26] scratches you know it's kind of a bit of
[16:28] a head scratch right that you know the
[16:30] Bible says that Abraham staggered not at
[16:31] the promise
[16:32] but
[16:34] wasn't Hagar supposed to be their carnal
[16:39] humanistic workaround to the promise
[16:42] that they didn't understand how it would
[16:44] how it would function so Sarah was like
[16:47] hey here's my maid servant Hagar we'll
[16:49] fulfill the promise that
[16:51] way well it kind of sounds like Abraham
[16:53] staggered at the promise a little bit
[16:54] didn't it right but that's not what God
[16:58] saw that's not
[17:00] God's view of things that's not how God
[17:03] saw things from a human perspective you
[17:05] might say that but from God's
[17:07] perspective Abraham staggered not why
[17:09] because there was a seed of God on the
[17:12] inside and that's what God was looking
[17:15] at right there was a piece of God inside
[17:17] Abraham it's another this is a another
[17:19] quote brother Brand's talking about the
[17:21] same thing about God believing his own
[17:24] word and he says um
[17:30] uh says and do you know that how how did
[17:32] God make the Earth this Earth that
[17:34] you're sitting on this morning people
[17:36] don't want to believe in faith how did
[17:38] God make the Earth he spoke it amen you
[17:40] see he spoke and the world came into
[17:44] existence and this world this morning is
[17:46] the spoken word of God
[17:49] uh spoken word of God and he believed
[17:52] his own
[17:53] word watch it and if God and if you're
[17:58] an offspring of of him and God is in you
[18:01] he will believe his own
[18:03] word though it can't be seen felt taste
[18:05] or anything you'll believe it see what I
[18:07] mean in other words if you have a part
[18:10] of God inside of you right the piece of
[18:13] God that's inside of you is going to do
[18:14] what God does and believe the word of
[18:17] God right it can't not and if there's
[18:20] something inside of you that's believing
[18:21] the word of God then it's going to come
[18:23] to pass no matter
[18:24] what you may or may not think or feel or
[18:28] do at any given point right there's
[18:31] something inside of you that's going to
[18:33] bring
[18:34] forth you know it might require
[18:36] particular environment it might require
[18:38] a particular time and place but it's
[18:40] going to manifest right it has
[18:43] to and so you know we we we carry on you
[18:47] know that here's this seed line
[18:49] continuing on from from Abraham it goes
[18:50] down through and and
[18:53] because God spoke that there would have
[18:55] to be this this
[18:58] this this lineage right that would
[19:01] ultimately terminate in in
[19:03] Christ that no matter how shaky things
[19:07] might have gotten the word was going to
[19:09] was going to find a way to be
[19:11] manifested right that here it is through
[19:15] through and that it would you know
[19:18] what's
[19:19] interesting you know we we talk about
[19:22] um you know time and I don't this is a
[19:25] rabbit hole I don't want to go down but
[19:27] um you know even like physics we talk
[19:29] about you know the in the modern world
[19:31] physicists have figured out that time
[19:32] and space are are actually linked
[19:34] directly that you can you know Einstein
[19:36] talked about this through relativity
[19:37] that fast you move through space low
[19:38] move you move through time where even
[19:40] with um GPS satellites they're moving so
[19:43] fast they actually have to um basically
[19:46] adjust the clocks on GPS satellites
[19:49] because they don't tick at the same rate
[19:51] as clocks on Earth um because they're
[19:54] moving through time differently right
[19:56] they literally will move if you if you
[19:57] just take a a clock from the earth and
[19:59] put it up in space and spin it around
[20:01] the earth fast enough eventually they'll
[20:03] the clocks will get out of time because
[20:06] if they're moving through time at a
[20:08] different
[20:09] rate
[20:12] well you know I guess my point in this
[20:15] is that when you're talking about time
[20:16] as a physical Dimension and you're
[20:18] talking about a God who is above time
[20:20] and can see all of time time isn't what
[20:23] to God what it is to us right for us
[20:27] time is a win and for God time can be
[20:30] aware right like when when God does
[20:35] something
[20:36] now and you
[20:39] know if if God does something now the
[20:43] the manifestation of it might not be to
[20:44] our perspective until 10 years later but
[20:46] it happened then right that's how a lamb
[20:49] could be slain before the foundation of
[20:50] the world right because because time
[20:53] isn't isn't the same right God God is
[20:57] outside of that when God does things
[20:58] things it's outside of what we think of
[21:01] as cause and effect and and the here and
[21:05] now right and so for God when he speaks
[21:08] this word about a seed
[21:11] lineage he can see that word going
[21:13] through the
[21:15] timeline from here to here and it's
[21:19] perfect all the way through even if it
[21:20] has
[21:22] to go through places that people don't
[21:24] normally expect right here it is that
[21:28] that word that seed is going to is going
[21:31] to manifest and as it manifests and and
[21:33] goes through time that that word is
[21:36] slowly unraveling and and growing and
[21:39] and and bringing to pass what the
[21:42] original intent was that there would be
[21:44] a savior right because that was this the
[21:46] the the prophecy in Genesis chapter 3
[21:48] that there would be
[21:49] a a that that there would be a uh
[21:53] a
[21:55] um that the that the woman's seed would
[21:58] bruise the head of the serpent and that
[22:00] it was a it was a particular person
[22:02] right well on the on the road to get
[22:05] there it's gonna it's going to go
[22:07] through people like Hagar or uh through
[22:09] I'm sorry not Hagar um Rahab right it's
[22:12] going to go through people like Ruth
[22:14] it's going to go through people like
[22:16] David you know of all people right it's
[22:19] going to go and it's like well these
[22:21] people aren't they're not good people
[22:25] from a human perspective right David
[22:28] David the the lecherous adulterous
[22:30] murderer who killed his one of his
[22:32] dearest friends who was nothing but
[22:34] loyal to him over you know over an
[22:38] affair and yet that's that's the that's
[22:41] who the Bible says that Christ would be
[22:44] the the son of David of all people right
[22:48] he couldn't he couldn't have been the
[22:50] you know couldn't have been the the son
[22:51] of of anybody else right couldn't have
[22:55] couldn't have why why not the son of of
[22:57] uh of Boaz
[23:00] right why not the son of Boaz it's only
[23:02] like couple Generations previous and we
[23:05] could have got to there but no it had to
[23:07] be the son of David right
[23:11] and you know this is just something to
[23:14] keep in your pocket we'll get back to
[23:15] that um so then we you know we fast
[23:18] forward and eventually we get down to we
[23:20] get down to to
[23:21] Mary and then we asked the question
[23:26] about why does the prophecy mention a
[23:28] woman's seed because traditionally we
[23:31] always think of the man being the one
[23:32] carrying the seed and the woman not and
[23:34] being you know the manifestation of that
[23:36] she brings forth the seed of the man but
[23:38] how is it that a prophecy would talk
[23:40] about a woman's
[23:41] seed right the only way that could
[23:44] happen is if a woman were to Bear a
[23:46] child that didn't involve a
[23:48] man h a virgin
[23:51] conceiving and not like what the
[23:54] Catholics teach where it's literally you
[23:56] know Mary's uh
[23:59] egg but Mary had a seat of God inside of
[24:02] her that when the word came to her she
[24:05] said so be it amen that's the that's the
[24:08] truth and that seed inside of her
[24:10] brought forth life right it was the
[24:13] woman's portion of God that brought
[24:16] forth Christ when she said amen to the
[24:18] word of God yeah right and
[24:21] so likewise today you know it's very
[24:27] lovely to to talk about Mary doing this
[24:29] these things but too many times people
[24:32] want to put that off on Mary or somebody
[24:34] else and don't want to recognize
[24:36] themselves in the picture don't want to
[24:38] put themselves in the picture and say
[24:39] well no but I do the same thing that's
[24:41] me too right there's another Mary in
[24:44] this day who say when the word of God
[24:46] comes to us we say Amen to the word of
[24:49] God and the same seed of God in us was
[24:52] the same seed in go of God and Mary and
[24:54] it'll if if that seed brought forth
[24:57] Christ
[24:59] then it will do the same thing in your
[25:01] life right if you say Amen to the word
[25:03] of
[25:04] God then the seed of God inside of you
[25:06] will bring forth the same life that Mary
[25:08] brought forth right it has to that's the
[25:10] only way it can work right no matter how
[25:13] hard you try no matter how hard you you
[25:17] know you you take that apple seed and
[25:18] you plant it no matter what ground you
[25:21] plant it in if it's conducive to life at
[25:24] all it's going to bring forth an apple
[25:25] tree no amount of changing the dirt is
[25:27] going to turn that apple seed into a
[25:29] pear seed right no amount of changing
[25:32] your set of circumstances going to
[25:34] change whether or not there's a that the
[25:36] seed of God inside of you brings forth
[25:38] anything other than God right and you
[25:42] know
[25:46] we we look at the you know and you know
[25:49] we talk you know know that the God and
[25:52] and Satan chose before the foundation of
[25:53] the world they were going to have a
[25:54] battle there's this Great War in heaven
[25:56] between Good and Evil that the
[25:58] Battleground for this war was going to
[26:00] take place in the human mind and in the
[26:01] human soul why on
[26:04] Earth would would that be the the the
[26:10] place that conflict would make sense
[26:12] right why would that be the place that
[26:14] that the battle would take
[26:16] place well it's
[26:18] because you know the disagreement is
[26:21] that Satan is saying to to Satan's
[26:23] argument is to God is no matter if you
[26:26] give people free moral agency that no
[26:30] matter how perfect you were to you could
[26:32] make them right no matter how perfect
[26:34] you could make them and no matter how
[26:37] perfect and beautiful and lovely the
[26:40] circumstances you would put them in I
[26:42] will find a way to corrupt
[26:44] them right that Satan no matter how
[26:48] perfect your spoken word is I will find
[26:50] a way to twist it right that's Satan's
[26:54] argument that's Satan's claim
[26:59] and so that's and so that's what God
[27:01] does right he makes a perfect world he
[27:02] makes a perfect Eden he makes a perfect
[27:04] people how could be who could be more
[27:05] perfect than those made in the image of
[27:07] God right they're absolutely Flawless
[27:11] and yet Satan found a way to corrupt
[27:15] them and then God's counterargument is
[27:18] Satan no matter how corrupt you could
[27:21] make them and no matter how corrupt you
[27:23] could make my children and no matter how
[27:25] corrupt and defiled you could make my
[27:27] world I will always find a way to
[27:29] perfect them right no matter how that's
[27:33] why God could
[27:35] choose
[27:36] Abraham that's why God could choose
[27:39] Isaac and Jacob and that's how God could
[27:42] choose us right that's how God could
[27:45] choose an imperfect people because it's
[27:48] there's no miracle in saving people who
[27:50] don't need saved right there's the the
[27:53] miraculous and the glory of God comes
[27:55] through saving people who really need it
[27:59] right it comes through saving people who
[28:01] are imperfect and and and even though
[28:04] they might fail and even though from the
[28:06] outside it looks like there's there is
[28:10] staggering there is no matter what no
[28:12] matter how bad things get no matter what
[28:15] the the the Earth that the seed is
[28:16] placed in no matter what your flesh
[28:18] might do or say no matter how corrupt
[28:20] your flesh might be there's something on
[28:23] the inside of the inside that says Amen
[28:25] to the word of God no matter how bad I
[28:27] st stumble and fall there's going to be
[28:30] a a a longing and a and a drive and a
[28:32] push to manifest the word of God right
[28:36] that for our day that there's going to
[28:38] be life come forth and so we're going to
[28:40] we're going to strive for that no matter
[28:41] how many times and no no matter how
[28:44] badly we fail there will always be a a a
[28:49] striving for Perfection a striving for
[28:52] towards becoming what God had intended
[28:55] us to
[28:56] be so that's
[28:59] we'll get you out two minutes early
[29:01] let's stand and have a word of
[29:08] prayer father Lord we thank you for this
[29:11] morning and this opportunity to maybe
[29:14] say something encouraging to the people
[29:16] Lord we ask that you would take the
[29:18] things that I would say in the hearts of
[29:21] the people and that you would anoint
[29:22] them that you would be with them with us
[29:24] through the day and that into the
[29:25] service into the worship service that we
[29:27] would come with Thanksgiving in our
[29:29] hearts and a and a and to bring a Joyful
[29:32] Noise to to praise your name and to and
[29:34] to to bring worship that you would be
[29:36] pleased to meet us here
[29:38] Lord and so father that we would worship
[29:41] you not just with with our you know
[29:44] clapping of hands and singing of songs
[29:45] and with instruments Lord but with our
[29:46] lives that our lives would be a living
[29:49] worship that everything we would do and
[29:52] say would be bring glory to your name
[29:55] that we wouldn't just simply be some lip
[29:57] service or some some song service Lord
[30:00] but that we would be a life lived
[30:04] according to your word there would be a
[30:06] constant thirst and a constant drive to
[30:09] be made perfect by Your
[30:11] Word we ask these things in the name
[30:14] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:16] amen
