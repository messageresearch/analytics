TRANSCRIPT
========================================
gracious father we just come before you Lord and we ask that your presence would be with us today father prepare our hearts for the worship and for the word Lord I pray you bless the Sunday School father and may it may it uh build and increase our faith we ask in Jesus name amen all right seventh and final installment of the truth about our future home and so if you want to go ahead and bring up that PowerPoint we're going to get right into a quote from brother brandham and I believe this is from his life story spoken in 1959 and I turned and looked and there was great big palaces and the glory of God coming up around them and I heard an Angelic choir singing my home sweet home I started up along long steps running just as hard as I could and when I got to the door there she stood a white garment on that black hair long holding down her back she raised out her arms as she always did when I come home tired from work or something I caught her by the hands and I said honey I seen Sharon down there I said she made a pretty girl didn't she she said yes Bill she said Bill put her arms around me she said just around my shoulder she started pading me she said stop worrying about me and Sharon I said honey I can't help it she said now Sharon and I are better off than you are and said' don't worry about us no more will you promise me amen I think I think about that and it amazes me because the loss and the pain that brother brandham had in that in that time that he felt and as much as God dealt with him the Visions he had how the Lord dealt with him it was such a struggle to the point where he tried to end his own life and it if it wasn't for the grace of God he wouldn't have he he wouldn't have continued his life and uh here now his wife is in a different place with a different perspective with an understanding I know you're in pain I know this is hard I know this it feels impossible but stop worrying amen and I think what a revelation that is for us for our loved ones that have gone on is don't worry about them if we have if we really have the right perspective don't worry about them they're they're well taken care of they're they're they're happier than they've ever been they're in a we just have to worry about making sure we make we make it there to be with them and I said hope I said I've been so lonesome for you and for Sharon and Billy cries all the time for you I said I don't know what to do with him and she said it'll be all right Bill she said just promise me you won't worry no more and she said won't you sit down and I looked around and there was a great big chair so perspective you know you we're so limited by time we're so limited by our perspective of life and here she is she can say this isn't just empty words well it's just uh nice little vision it's it's really it should hit home for us don't it'll be all right God's God has everything under his control we don't have to worry about it we we whether we've lost a loved one someone has gone on we didn't lose them we know right where they are and so here she's going to give him some even better perspective says and I looked around and there was a great big chair and I remember I tried to buy a chair now in closing I tried to buy a chair one time we just had them old common wooden bottom chairs for that breakfast set we had to had to use them the only chairs we had and we could buy one of the chairs that would let back in the back like I forget what kind of easy chair rest chair and it cost $17 and you could pay $3 down in a dollar a week and we got one and know when I'd come I'd work all day and preach till midnight around the streets and wherever I could preach and now one day I got behind on my payments I couldn't make it and it got day after day and finally one day they come by and got my chair and took it that night I never we'll forget she had a cherry pie baked poor little old thing she know I was going to be disappointed after supper I said what's you so good about tonight honey she said say I I had the boys over in the neighborhood to dig some fishing worms don't you think we had to go down to the river and fish a little while I said yes but and she started crying I know there was something wrong I had an idea cuz they'd already sent me a notice they was coming to get it and we couldn't make that dollar payment a week we couldn't couldn't afford it she put her her arms around me and I went to the door and my chair was gone she told me up there she said you remember that CH chair Bill I said yes honey I remember I said that's what you was thinking about wasn't it yeah she said well they won't take this one this one's paid for amen she said sit down just a minute I want to talk to you and I said honey I don't understand this she said promise me Billy promise me that you won't worry anymore you're going back now and he said promise me you won't worry and I said I I can't do that hope and just then I come to it was in the dark room I looked around and I felt her arm around me I said hope are you here in the room she started patting me she said you you going to make me that promise Bill promise me you won't worry no more I said I promise you amen worry and fear is perspective based under our limitations true Faith makes that connection with God and says the there's nothing to worry and there's nothing to fear we're not promised an easy life a Carefree pain-free life we are actually told we will have troubles why because we're fighting on God's side there's an enemy against us trying to rule this world and we're the only thing holding him back from taking complete control over everything so of course we're going to have troubles and trials but we have a promise that we have a home we have a rest our citizenship isn't in America or Canada or Mexico it's in heaven that's where we belong hope where went to where she belonged that's where she was from our perspective is we lost them and they belong here and we could have had a full life and we missed out on this and we missed out on that and there's an aspect humanly speaking that that is true but not in God's economy not in God's Vision not in God's plan God knew what he had to do to make brother brandham the brother brandham that he needed to be amen for the purpose that God had for as Paul said if if we have a hope only in this life we're above all men most miserable so our hope isn't just in this life our hope is in heaven brother brandom's hope was in heaven here twofold his hope and his hope and so that he he he could realize he was told don't worry Don't Fear now let's look further people say are there animals in heaven we went through the scriptures on this but I want to read to you what brother brandham said and I looked coming down across the hill and here come old Fritz he looked at me come up and lick me on the hand I patted him just then old Prince my horse come put his neck around my shoulder and begin to nicker I said oh God I looked up and he said all the ever loved and all that ever loved you is gathered here amen hallelujah amen now again I I don't want to I I made this point many times ago but I'm going to bring it up again this doesn't bypass the new birth repentance being filled with the Holy Ghost um God dealing with people's lives it doesn't bypass the word but what what is being it's not saying every single thing that you ever love is going to be there what what is it those things that God has redeemed from your life are going to be there see you know we we we have to take the promise and base it on God's word strictly not our own thinking about it but with that said Fritz is there Prince is there his his favorite animals are there as a promise for him his chair is there how far do we go when we look at what God redeems for us and and preserves for us as we talked before there's a bank account that we have in heaven and we can make deposits in it right and so the rewards that God gives to US based on we don't even deserve it right we're not earning that it's all by grace and yet every sacrifice that we make every gift that we give you know with a true heart God says you're going to get it back a h hundredfold right remember what we talked about before what percentage is hundredfold it's actually 10,000% so the things that we've lost look at this brother brandom got his horse back got his dog back those things that were special I believe that he'll do the same thing for you and it it isn't just limited to animals it can be everything you say could it what what could it be what what is the limit I don't I don't know amen I don't know maybe God will give you back when one of your old cars brother Mark I don't know say it's not possible because it'll be I wouldn't think it's possible to get your horse back your chair if you can get your chair back what else can God give back to you um I'm looking forward to having my cabin in northern Minnesota and so these these things that God God God let's talk about giving gifts we have this idea it's not it's the thought that counts and we put everything off to just the thought that counts but you have to know that giving a gift is actually an extension of yourself to that person so when you give a gift you're actually extending yourself out to that person so when God gives a gift to us he's extending his his heart out to us and we receive that gift as though we're receiving him himself right and so I think the same thing goes to this is God God knows how to give Us rewards things that are exactly designed for us as individuals and so when we when we get to the other side we can definitely expect that God's going to give us and even redeem things for us that we lost that we didn't even remember and it takes us back to that moment and we think my goodness God God loves knew me this much and loved me this much that this thing that I lost and meant so much to me here he's given it back to me here yes yes he does love us that much amen and God had explained brother brandom says and I used to tell the people I I never could sing oh my I was a million miles from that but I said if you ever get over in heaven and live in your big Palace you know up there I said way down at the bottom of the hill back in the woods back there there's a little cabin set there will be mine and one of these mornings when you walk out on the porch and hear somebody standing up there singing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound saved a Wretch like Me you say praise God old brother brandham finally made it it will it will be me over there listing trying to sing amen so again God knows how to cater each thing to the kind of person he's made us to be I think brother brandom talks about he he knew would enjoy certain people would enjoy mountains so he made mountains that way he knew people would enjoy the desert I don't know who but people enjoy the desert so brother Matt enjoys the desert so he made a desert he made Lakes he made streams he made made all the different uh types of nature because he knew that we would enjoy it that way so if you think like that and understand that way God will do the same for you if if you're the kind of person that Jo enjoys a little cabin amongst the pine trees well that's the kind of that's you're going to get that if you're the kind of person that enjoys a big old Palace you're going to get that some people will have a palace some some people will have a little little Shack in the woods amen I like to have a mix I have a big Palace that's that's a cabin in the woods in the mountains on a lake amen but these are the things God has designed us in a certain way to enjoy certain things and those are are going to be what our rewards are Revelation 21:4 and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and when he had opened the fifth seal I under saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled all right so as we look at these Verses first first of all 21:4 you know there's there's coming a time where all wrongs will be made right God will wipe away all tears from their eyes now I think as I look at this and contemplate this you know I don't in that moment there's a difference between tears because you're broken right amen andain pain and tears that come from Joy and so I think I I think what's going to be wiped away is all pain all sorrow all death crying for that but crying for Joy I mean that that's never going to go away that's never going to cease crying for thankfulness will never will never cease because we that will go on and on and on because we'll never stop rejoicing and being thankful at what God has blessed and prepared for us but there's a there is coming a time all wrongs will be made right not in the Millennium but in the new Heaven and the new Earth all right and so again then we looked what we talked about this before just kind of bringing things into a completion and summary you know Revelation 6 9-1 these people are aware of what's happening on Earth they're aware they're aware of the prophetic timetable and they're in a position they're still people made in the image of God they're there praying and asking God how long you know these are the Jewish Martyrs and they're asking how long until you judge them they they're aware God has not yet brought for full judgment on the people that dwell on the earth that killed them he says wait a little bit because they're going to have to kill some more of your brothers and and they're given white robes right so we understand they're they maintain their memories they they're they're the same people they know what happened to them and there there's a connection between who they were and who they will always be this isn't just in the intermediate Heaven as we've talked about this is in the new Heaven and new earth some people think he'll wipe away all tears from our eyes it means we'll have no more memory no then what in the world did God redeem us and bring us through sorrow and suffering to manifest himself for if we have no memory of it anymore it doesn't make any sense he wants us to always remember it who who will Jesus be who is who is he referred to in the Book of Revelation in the new Heaven and the new Earth the lamb why is he referred to as the lamb because he was slain from the foundation of the world for us I believe he'll have scars in his side and in his hands for all of eternity so that we'll remember that we're there because of him Hallelujah Luke 16 verse 19 the parable the rich man in Lazarus there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores and Desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sorce and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham AAR off and Lazarus in his bosom and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this flame but Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivest good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented beside all this between us and you there is a great Gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from then then he said I pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my father's house for I have five Brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of Torment Abraham saith unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them so we see in this case again it's from a long time ago so it's worth repeating even the rich man who is in Hell still had a connection and feeling for his family so there's still that connection in in the in the next life let's put it that way there's still that connection for us we we love our family we want to we want to make sure that they're okay just like those saints were there you know it's it's it's a shame that we have this super spiritual idea of Heaven that wipes away the familial connections that we have as though we're going to go to heaven and it'll be just like well every once in a while you see your wife and you're just like oh hey I remember you no it's not going to be like that there's that family connection that remains if for somebody in Hell how much more for someone in heaven will that relationship be right because everything everything will be purified now all of our relationships are troubled by selfish nness and pride and but then that's all done away with when you're in that body and so there's that there remains that connection and as we talked about before the great cloud of witnesses that surrounds us that knows what we're going through if you if you go back to the vision that we thought about with um sister hope and brother brandham she knew he was worried about yeah amen them and so she could advise because she was aware of what was Happening Now does God let let our family see everything that's going on and there's no way of knowing that really but somehow they they knew maybe they just know in general I don't know but somehow they knew and she knew what to speak specifically to him how did that work did God instruct her did we don't actually have the details we just know that God G at least gives a glimpse to them on the other side wow so let's look at what our bodies will be like again I think all of us are probably aware of different things that brother brandom said but I want to I want to review them I think the thing is what what ends up happening is uh even in the message we get Traditions that build around something just because so and so said it for 25 years and he never went back to the original quote and he realized he was just and everybody else started doing the same thing because of course this is brother so- and so and so go back to the original source and I think anything any anytime you have a certain subject or topic or something that we hold dear if you forget the reason why behind it event eventually you're going to let go of it it itself anyways all right so uh demonology for from the religious realm says not old no more that was Abraham and Sarah and they vanished look they looked somebody's watching us they could vanish just like he went through the wall the same kind of a body Hallelujah right here is all the prophets walking around looking around the city all right in questions and answers now the first things happens when we're resurrected the ones which are living uh will just REM still still remain the resurrection will set in first the resurrection of those that are asleep there'll be Awakening time and those which are asleep in the dust now but those that are asleep in sin CU they sleep right on they don't awake for another thousand years but those are sleeping in the dust will be awakened first these corruptible bodies will put on incorruption in the rapturing grace of the Lord and then we'll all get together and we begin and then and when they begin to get together then we which are alive and remain shall be changed these mortal bodies will not see death but just of a sudden there'll be like a sweep go over us and you'll be changed you're turned back like Abraham was from an old man to a young man from an old woman to a young woman what's this sudden changed after a while you're traveling like a thought and you could see those then who are already resurrected oh what a hour then will gather with them and then be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air in an uncertain sound Jesus after he had been glorified and received his glorified body raised up from the dead and ascended on high to the father come back in a few seconds later and with such terrific speed till he come right in before his disciples through a wall and never even moved the wall and yet with a body that could stand there and eat fish and bread that speed coming through wow amen all all right so I want to just make this comment and and liken on our bodies unto this is it isn't a Wonder that Jesus in a resurrected body could appear to them and do those things that he could do um we look at at we we and in when I say we those in history and in the past have looked at that body as a spiritual type of body and not a physical form of a body through through time and through history and the reality is if if you actually look at it maybe maybe we are the ones that are actually the ghosts and they're in the real form yes that that we're actually supposed to be in so when Jesus can eat bread and fish in a resurrected body the Wonder is how does someone in the real place eat something that's in the unreal place because that's the that's how we should look at it we're not the substance we're just the shadow yeah I'm not saying we're ghosts don't get me wrong but I'm saying if you think about that substance versus Shadow Jesus body resurrected body is the is the substance it's the real thing that we're based off of we're actually just a Corruption of that and so when the two become one when this body joins up with the theophany then that becomes a glor glorified body then we're in the condition that we're supposed to be in all right now let's let's look at the next quote from the seed is not air with the Shu this is Brother brandom speaking about his um experience when he was praying in the brush Harbor in the spot before the brandom Tabernacle was built and he saw a vision of the Lord Jesus then I thought maybe I'll call him when I said Jesus he turned his head and when he looked at me me he just raised his arms out that's all I remember for about nearly daylight I was laying right out there right out here somewhere where this place is now in the field my pajama shirt all wet with tears where I had been crying and I had passed out his face had characters that no artist could draw or paint they could not do it he looked like a man that if you could look at him he wanted to cry with sympathy and respect with reverence and yet with enough power that would speak it would turn the world over and the characters could never be caught by an artist all right so let's look at some of the aspects of what our bodies will be like we'll be able to just use our modern terminology we'll be able to teleport from one place to another just by a thought you'll be instantly somewhere else we will obviously we're going to be in an actual body the real substance body but we'll able to be able to pass through walls and objects as we so desire it'll be immortal so in other words you're not even it's you can't kill it next we'll have the ability to speak a world into and out of existence not that we will use that but that we're capable of creation and destruction in another place brother Bram says we'll be able to fly at terrific speeds from one place to another so I don't know sometimes you'll fly and sometimes you'll tell teleport I guess depends on what you want to do all right is there time in heaven well in the current Heaven sure we told that there was silence in heaven for how long the space of half an hour the Jewish Saints under the altar were told rest for a little season we're also shown that there is a progression of time on Earth also think about back to the very beginning when God made Adam and Eve that was the paradise what did he what did he put in the heavens the Sun the moon the stars they were for what times and seasons and years so we will be not limited by time but there there will still be a progression of Life yes amen just like there was at the beginning remember the Heaven and the new Earth is not a not new in that sense it's a restoration back to the way it was originally with Satan wiped off the scene so when God created the heavens and the Earth it was in the beginning time God created the Heaven space and Earth matter in the same instant time space and matter were created so they all actually go along with each other and so they all go together and the new Earth will be that paradise restored back to us all right so let's let me see where I got here yes CS Lewis says this about I'm I'm thinking of this in regards to the type of body we'll have it's a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses to remember that the dullest most uninteresting person you can talk to May one day be a creature which if you saw it now you would be strongly tempted to worship take that from John
