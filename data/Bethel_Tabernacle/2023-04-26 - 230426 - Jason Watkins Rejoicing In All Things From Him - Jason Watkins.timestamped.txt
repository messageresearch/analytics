[8:42] Love the thrill that I feel when I get
[8:45] together with God's
[8:50] wonderful people.
[8:53] Well, it could be just anywhere
[8:57] that two or three are gathered there
[9:02] that the spirit of the Lord will be
[9:06] there too.
[9:10] And there's no fellowship so sweet.
[9:14] There's no joy that can compete

[18:22] Amen. Amen. Amen. Okay, y'all going to
[18:26] have to do that again. And the reason is
[18:29] cuz it looks weird to say, "Let us raise
[18:31] our hands toward heaven." And nobody's
[18:33] raising their hands.
[18:35] I've seen about a third of you. I'll
[18:37] give you credit. So if you're going to

[19:27] [Music]
[19:27] [Applause]
[19:28] [Music]
[19:29] Amen. Well, I just like to make you
[19:31] practice what you preach. Amen. You make
[19:33] me practice what I preach. Amen. And so
[19:36] if you're going to say it and sing it,
[19:37] do it.
[19:38] Amen. You know, Brother Brandham, he he
[19:41] said some things I'd never have the
[19:43] courage to say. You just had to have a
[19:44] prophetic jurisdiction. You know, he
[19:47] said, "But listen,
[19:49] if you're not going to be and live like
[19:51] a Christian, stop saying you're one."
[19:56] I was like, "Wow,
[19:59] stop." Cuz I mean, in my mind, I'd go,
[20:01] "Well, you should at least let the weak
[20:02] say I'm strong." But he said, "If you're
[20:05] not going to be a Christian, stop saying
[20:07] you're one because out there you you you
[20:10] cause the unbeliever to go, hm, you
[20:13] know, wow." You know, and and that
[20:15] brings harm on the Lord Jesus. Brother
[20:18] Brandham said another thing one time how
[20:20] that, you know, we I always have the
[20:24] idea that if somebody wants to come to
[20:26] church, let's bring them. Let's let's
[20:27] get the whole neighborhood. We couldn't
[20:29] fit them, but I'd love to get the whole
[20:30] neighborhood. tried to cram them in here
[20:32] one time and and Brother Brandham says,
[20:34] "But you know," he said, "A lot of
[20:36] times," he cautioned those churches. He
[20:38] said, "A lot of times you're just piling
[20:40] up rocks
[20:43] cuz you're not getting them born again.
[20:45] You're just bringing them in the
[20:46] building
[20:46] and you're getting them." He said, "Now,
[20:49] boy, this took my breath away." He said,
[20:51] "You would have been better to left them
[20:53] out there because then they knew they
[20:56] were a sinner and God could deal with
[20:57] them. But you bring them into a church,
[21:00] make them clean up their lifestyle, and
[21:01] they think they're in. And they're not
[21:03] even born again of the spirit of God.
[21:06] Oh, the ways of God are past finding
[21:08] out. My, we're still children learning,
[21:10] aren't we?
[21:11] Amen. I sure feel like that. Amen.
[21:14] Lartha, good to see you guys here
[21:16] tonight. God bless you all. We're going
[21:17] to invite you to James chapter 1. Amen.
[21:21] Praise the Lord.
[21:24] Amen. Praise the Lord. Sister Sweetheart
[21:26] didn't know I was going to preach from
[21:27] her favorite book tonight, but I am.
[21:32] Amen. I'm gonna if you're ever in heaven
[21:34] and you can't find Sister Debbie, just
[21:36] find James.
[21:39] They'll be sitting under an oak tree and
[21:40] she'll be going, "Now, you said this."
[21:42] Now, you know, that really affected me.
[21:43] And
[21:45] amen. Praise the Lord. And uh I love his
[21:48] practical approach. Probably why Sister
[21:50] Debbie loves him. She's a practical
[21:52] lady.
[21:53] verse 12. I want to read from verse 12
[21:56] through verse 18. I want to speak
[21:58] tonight on rejoicing in all things from
[22:02] him.
[22:03] I want you to say all.
[22:05] All.
[22:06] Now remember you said that.
[22:09] Okay. Rejoicing
[22:11] in all things from him. James chapter 1
[22:16] verse 12. Like to say welcome home to
[22:19] all the families. Man, we had a bunch of
[22:20] y'all. We were missing everybody. Amen.
[22:22] Brother JD and sister Amy are still on
[22:24] vacation and um you know up in well they
[22:27] he preached and so he's resting up in
[22:29] the Smokies and all the brothers were
[22:31] saying enjoy the rest brother JD and I
[22:33] was like no get home.
[22:35] Okay, rest but get home. Hurry.
[22:39] Amen. They said they missed us and we
[22:41] sure miss them and glad to see everybody
[22:43] back in one piece and probably still got
[22:45] one or two families out uh out and
[22:47] about. Verse 12.
[22:50] Blessed is the man that endureth
[22:54] temptation,
[22:56] for when he is tried, he shall receive
[22:59] the crown of life, which the Lord hath
[23:02] promised to them that love him. Now,
[23:05] every last one of us would love the last
[23:08] part of that verse.
[23:10] But nobody wants what it takes to get
[23:12] the last part of that verse. The last
[23:15] part is you'll receive a crown of life
[23:17] which the Lord promised to them that
[23:19] love him. That's great. But then I've
[23:22] got to endure temptation. And when I'm
[23:25] try and and I've got to overcome in
[23:27] trials. See
[23:29] verse 13. Watch James in his practical
[23:31] nononsense way break down all your uh
[23:34] conceited barriers. Let no man say when
[23:38] he is tempted, I am tempted of God. For
[23:40] God cannot be tempted with evil, neither
[23:43] tempteth he any man. See, but every man
[23:48] is tempted. Here's the plain hard
[23:50] sassifras truth. Every man is tempted
[23:53] when he is drawn away of his own lust
[23:55] and enticed.
[23:57] Then when lust hath conceived, now watch
[24:00] James put this together for you. So this
[24:02] there's no there should be no doubt in
[24:05] your mind what that's going to lead to
[24:07] after you read this. Then when lust hath
[24:10] conceived, it bringeth forth sin. Look
[24:12] at this domino effect. And sin when it
[24:15] is finished, bringeth forth death. I
[24:18] don't want death.
[24:22] Amen.
[24:23] Nobody wants death. But
[24:25] but but I don't I don't want the cause
[24:28] of death. The cause of death is sin. I
[24:30] don't want sin. I I And not just because
[24:33] I'm afraid to go to hell. That's not
[24:35] fear's long ago gone. I love the Lord
[24:40] and I want to be a Christian.
[24:44] Verse 16.
[24:46] Now watch, he's going to turn a corner.
[24:48] Actually going to flip the coin on you.
[24:51] Do not heir, my beloved brethren. Every
[24:54] good gift and every perfect gift is from
[24:58] above and cometh down from the Father of
[25:02] lights, with whom is no variableness,
[25:07] neither shadow of turning. Of his own
[25:10] will begget he us with the word of
[25:14] truth, that we should be a kind of first
[25:17] fruits of his creatures.
[25:21] Let's pray.
[25:23] Lord, we thank you for your word
[25:25] tonight. And I'm just trying to relax
[25:28] myself, Lord, into the flow of the Holy
[25:31] Spirit. A little bit
[25:36] laborous to me, Lord, to try to figure
[25:39] out. There's more material than I could
[25:42] cover and to try to find your exact
[25:44] mind. And I believe that you've given me
[25:46] that, Lord. But I I stand here ready
[25:49] Lord at any moment at a moment's notice
[25:51] without warning to be changed in my
[25:54] direction. So I humble myself before you
[25:57] and I ask you to help me Lord to uh the
[26:01] the spirit of the prophets is subject to
[26:03] the prophet and you know my intent is to
[26:06] try Lord to um go at a at a at a
[26:09] different kind of a pace tonight and I
[26:11] think you've given me the kind of
[26:12] material that will be conducive to that.
[26:15] just trying to see this enemy defeated
[26:18] Lord from my body and get through it. So
[26:21] just trying to use some wisdom Lord I
[26:22] commit it to you now in Jesus name.
[26:25] Amen. God bless you friends. You can be
[26:27] seated.
[26:28] Amen. So I'm going to make a give it the
[26:31] old Notre Dame try to not blow up. And
[26:36] this sermon the more I kept studying it.
[26:38] It it seemed very simple and
[26:40] straightforward. And the more I kept
[26:41] studying it and man, it started turning
[26:43] into a wildfire and started getting out
[26:46] of control. And I told Sister Tav, I
[26:49] said, "Man, I'm going to have to really
[26:50] be careful." You say, "There's really
[26:51] something to that." Sure. Absolutely.
[26:54] Um, well, I would only unmute it if I
[26:57] wanted to use it. Right.
[27:00] Okay. Now, I'm muted. You see why I
[27:02] leave this up, brothers? That's exactly
[27:04] why I say, "Don't push that down. That
[27:07] way, they'll have a backup back there."
[27:10] Amen. Not to mention that drives my OCD
[27:12] crazy. Amen.
[27:15] Praise the Lord. So,
[27:19] you know, Brother Bam talks about that
[27:22] uh anointing that would come upon him.
[27:24] And of course, you know, as a prophet,
[27:26] that's a whole different level. That's
[27:29] next level anointing. And and brother
[27:32] Brandon would actually have to walk off
[27:33] the platform. And he makes statements,
[27:36] you know, to the to the effect that, you
[27:38] know, he said, 'If I could stand it in
[27:41] my body, he said the Holy Spirit would
[27:43] just stand there all night and discern.
[27:45] He said, till I just fell over. And
[27:47] there were times when he didn't exercise
[27:50] wisdom and fell over
[27:52] and then had to leave the field for
[27:54] weeks on end. That's not unusual.
[27:56] Daniel, just from one vision, Daniel
[27:59] collapsed, fell on his knees, and passed
[28:01] out just in the presence of an angel.
[28:04] And and Daniel said, "I was troubled in
[28:07] my head for many days." And he he
[28:11] finally, you know, the angel Daniel
[28:13] collapsed and the angel puts his hand on
[28:15] and says, "Daniel, stand up. I need to
[28:17] tell I'm sent to tell you these things.
[28:19] Stand up on your feet. I've got to tell
[28:20] you this." And Daniel stands up on his
[28:22] feet. And the angel starts talking. And
[28:24] he faints again. Collapses. And finally,
[28:26] the angel has to turn to the to the
[28:29] spirit on the water, the Holy Spirit,
[28:30] and say, "Hey, you're going to have to
[28:31] help him." and he and he literally had
[28:34] to come and put his hand on Daniel and
[28:36] stand him up on his feet again. First,
[28:38] Daniel got up on his knees and he's a
[28:39] little wobbly and finally got to his
[28:41] feet. These things are real, friends.
[28:43] I'm here to tell you the the presence
[28:45] and of God is more real. It's not
[28:48] goosebumps. The presence of God is is an
[28:51] awesome thing where prophets felt like
[28:55] it might their next breath might be
[28:56] their last. And you know, Moses said, "I
[29:01] did exceedingly fear and quake."
[29:04] Amen.
[29:04] And so this is why God gives the
[29:07] prerogative to the speaker to to use
[29:11] wisdom. And so I'm trying to do that
[29:13] tonight, trying to rid myself completely
[29:15] of this terrible plague of shingles. And
[29:18] I'm almost got it. Uh finally got off of
[29:21] all medicine. Even the eye doctor
[29:22] finally took me off my eye drops today.
[29:24] I was so glad that stuff was not
[29:26] comfortable going in. But uh it looks
[29:30] good and I appreciate your prayers. God
[29:32] bless you. Please keep praying for
[29:34] Sister Jean. She is just still um not
[29:37] good. But we're going to be have her on
[29:39] the prayer list tonight with a number of
[29:40] other things. Now, when I when I think
[29:44] about this scripture,
[29:47] you're going to find that that James is
[29:50] going to draw a a very stark contrast.
[29:54] And it's done on purpose. And he's going
[29:57] to literally show the dark side of man
[30:01] and the devil and the world. When a
[30:04] man's enticed and led away of his own
[30:06] lust and it brings forth sin and that
[30:08] brings forth death, don't fool yourself.
[30:10] He's saying, see, don't don't end up you
[30:13] you need you need to think about where
[30:15] you go and what you do. You need to
[30:17] think about what you give your eyes to
[30:19] and your ears to. You need to think
[30:21] about your friends.
[30:22] See, you need to think about your
[30:25] fellowship. You need to think about
[30:26] these kinds of things that make you
[30:29] strong because the absence of them make
[30:32] you weak.
[30:35] See, you believe that? So, so, so we
[30:39] find that that James is now going to
[30:41] make a a very sharp contrast. In fact,
[30:45] is I tried to to think of is there even
[30:48] a sharper contrast? And I don't think
[30:51] you you'd look through the whole Bible
[30:53] and find an apostle so bent on making
[30:58] you see the two sides
[31:01] starkly
[31:02] with no no ambiguity. He's saying,
[31:05] "Listen, this is sin. This is lust. And
[31:09] this is the devil. And this is death.
[31:12] And this is light. And this is the
[31:14] father of lights. And this is every good
[31:17] gift. And this is where the believer is
[31:19] to live."
[31:20] Amen.
[31:22] See,
[31:24] I mean, you know, one one commentator
[31:27] said, you know, concerning how he said
[31:30] here, every good gift and every perfect
[31:32] gift is from above. and cometh down from
[31:35] the father of lights. One commentator
[31:39] comments that shadows from the sun
[31:42] shift, but not the one who made the sun.
[31:46] I took great comfort in that. You've
[31:48] heard me talk about it before that God,
[31:52] you know, God is not moody.
[31:54] He doesn't pout
[31:56] like we do. He doesn't, you know, he
[31:58] doesn't he doesn't wear his feelings on
[32:00] his sleeve like we do. He doesn't get up
[32:03] on the wrong side of the bed.
[32:05] He doesn't have a bad hair day.
[32:09] Okay?
[32:11] There is no variableness.
[32:14] There's no variation.
[32:16] He's he's he's of old of from
[32:19] everlasting. He's the same yesterday,
[32:22] today, and forever. He's always good.
[32:26] He's always holy. He always has always
[32:31] has your best interest
[32:34] in his mind.
[32:36] He says that you don't have to worry
[32:39] about the intentions of God for his
[32:42] family because he says in the Bible, I
[32:46] know my intentions for you that they are
[32:49] for good and not for harm. So listen
[32:52] friend, whatever you run out run into
[32:55] out here in the world that that just
[32:57] seems to weary you down and puts you
[33:00] under burdens and trials and even the
[33:02] fiery kind, just understand that God has
[33:06] not lost his intention to do you good
[33:09] and to grow you and bring you to the
[33:11] crown that James started by talking
[33:15] about in verse 11.
[33:17] Amen.
[33:18] Blessed is the man that endureth. See,
[33:21] when he's tried, he shall receive a
[33:23] crown. This is God's provided way for
[33:27] excellence. We spoke here recently on
[33:29] excellence versus sufficiency or
[33:32] sufficiency versus excellence. And I
[33:34] determined that I wanted to excel. I
[33:36] determined that I don't just want to
[33:38] make the grade. I I want to cross the
[33:41] Here I go.
[33:44] I want to cross the finish line running.
[33:50] And I'm not going to take off running.
[33:55] I apologize for that. Please pardon me
[33:58] because every time I I go that way the
[34:02] next several days are not good.
[34:04] So I'm just That's why brother Matt
[34:06] ended up we swapped last Sunday. We may
[34:08] do that again this Sunday. I'm
[34:10] determined to get past it. We'll see.
[34:11] Just keep keep me in prayer.
[34:14] And so, so we find out that that I I
[34:18] want I want excellency.
[34:21] And this is actually what God
[34:24] forecasts
[34:26] for those people that we've been talking
[34:28] about. You remember that group of people
[34:30] at the end time who know their God
[34:33] and do great exploits?
[34:36] Two things to remember. First of all,
[34:39] it's not just you that's going to do
[34:41] exploits. the Antichrist. If you go up
[34:43] five or six verses, I forget how many,
[34:45] and it talks about the Antichrist, he's
[34:47] going to do exploits.
[34:49] So, so, so there's going to be a lot of
[34:51] exploits going on here at the end time.
[34:54] And they're very, they're starkly
[34:56] different. And you need to make up your
[34:58] mind which pack you want to run with.
[35:00] Amen.
[35:01] Now, you're getting to the heart of my
[35:03] sermon.
[35:04] Which pack do we want to run with? Make
[35:07] up your mind. Do you want to be a
[35:10] Christian or do would you rather not
[35:14] make up your mind? Be honest with God.
[35:17] At least he'll respect you.
[35:20] He He despises lukewarmness.
[35:24] It nauseates him.
[35:28] Amen.
[35:28] He would rather That that seems in
[35:31] congress to me. God would rather you be
[35:35] cold
[35:36] than warm. Amen.
[35:40] He would much rather you be hot than
[35:42] either.
[35:44] But whatever you do, don't be that
[35:46] nauseating lukewarm water and try to
[35:49] make him drink that sacrifice, that
[35:51] drink offering like David brought him.
[35:53] And David brought fresh, cool, clean
[35:56] water from deep in the bedrock. And God
[35:59] received that kind of a sacrifice. Cain
[36:02] brought his best efforts and said to
[36:05] God, "Take it or leave it."
[36:09] Probably never imagining that God would
[36:11] say, "Okay, I'll leave it."
[36:15] See, so so there's this stark contrast
[36:19] between the two. And he says here,
[36:22] there's no shadow of turning in him. And
[36:24] I love this verse 18, of his own will
[36:27] begott us with the word of truth. So
[36:30] there should be no doubt in our minds
[36:34] how you get born again.
[36:37] See by the word of truth. That's how he
[36:40] begat you. That's how you got into his
[36:42] family. By the word of truth. No wonder
[36:45] brother Brandon would say, "Brother
[36:46] Brandon, what's the new birth?" It's a
[36:48] person. It's a revelation of Jesus
[36:50] Christ personally to you. See, because I
[36:54] mean it's not as if the word
[36:57] suddenly became true. The word was true
[37:01] when you were a sinner.
[37:02] Yes. Amen.
[37:04] But that didn't do anything to you. It
[37:06] didn't it didn't become true and and at
[37:09] the day you got saved, it was always
[37:10] true. Just had no effect on you. You
[37:12] might have even read the Bible.
[37:14] Yes. Amen.
[37:16] But it but but it's not just the fact
[37:18] that it's true didn't didn't change a
[37:21] thing. So the fact that you're now
[37:24] changed, it becomes apparent that it was
[37:27] something happened more than just this
[37:29] being true.
[37:31] This became real to you.
[37:34] This became an experiential thing
[37:37] with you. Amen.
[37:42] The sense that there is um trying to
[37:47] been trying to you know put this
[37:49] together in my mind.
[37:52] the sense that there is in the in the
[37:54] age that we live in today
[37:58] someh quasi no man's land of uh uh some
[38:03] kind of approved area of compromise
[38:07] between good and evil
[38:10] or right and wrong
[38:13] I want you to know that's a myth
[38:18] that that that the world would have us
[38:20] believe that there is some acceptable
[38:24] area where you can live where the word
[38:28] is watered down
[38:31] and weakened
[38:32] so that right and wrong become obscure
[38:36] and and and and there you are just in
[38:38] that mediocre mediocrity lukewarmness
[38:42] and you know it's it's this whole spirit
[38:44] on the age today of inclusion and it
[38:47] that sounds like a noble gesture
[38:51] you Now, we should include everybody.
[38:53] I'm happy to have anybody in the family
[38:56] of God who wants to be born again of the
[38:59] spirit.
[39:01] But I I'm sorry if it hurts your woke
[39:04] feelings, but I don't want to share
[39:07] heaven with people who aren't born
[39:09] again.
[39:10] I've had to put up with that my whole
[39:13] life. Amen.
[39:15] I want a place that's purely pure and
[39:18] completely clean and and absolutely
[39:22] holy.
[39:23] Amen.
[39:26] Oh, the day
[39:29] that I've waited on my whole life is
[39:32] just ahead of us, friends.
[39:37] So the sense of the world and I'm I'm
[39:39] coming to you tonight with the with the
[39:41] words of the Apostle James so that you
[39:45] don't fall into that trap and get
[39:49] poisoned
[39:51] in your mind
[39:53] and think that there's some acceptable
[39:55] middle ground.
[39:57] I you know I I I I'm not a sinner. I
[40:00] believe God sent a prophet. Okay. Well,
[40:03] I even know who he is. Great. And I
[40:05] believe everything he said. Well, that's
[40:06] wonderful. But what is it doing to your
[40:09] life?
[40:12] See, it's one thing to be in what we
[40:14] call the message. It's all together
[40:16] different thing for the message to be in
[40:18] you
[40:19] because the message isn't the message.
[40:21] The message is a person.
[40:23] Understand that it's the Lord Jesus
[40:25] Christ in the form of his word. And he's
[40:27] come down to tabernacle himself in a
[40:29] body to make you the continuation of
[40:32] him. And there's no there's no
[40:33] compromising on that
[40:36] there. We got all kinds of weaknesses.
[40:38] Let's just own it. Let's look at one
[40:39] another and say, you know, it's not my
[40:41] brother or my sister. It really is me
[40:44] standing in the need of prayer. That's
[40:45] not what I'm talking about. We've all
[40:47] got ups and downs. We're like Elijah,
[40:49] men and women of like of like passions,
[40:52] but that's not my heart. That's not my
[40:55] desire.
[40:57] I want a ferveny. And that's what the
[41:00] word has come in this hour to call you
[41:04] unto ferveny.
[41:05] Amen.
[41:06] Listen friends, a lot of people don't
[41:08] want to pay the price. Let's just be
[41:10] honest. You might be one of them here
[41:12] tonight. I I could say that I want more
[41:15] of God. And that might not be true of
[41:17] you. And and I'm sorry if that's true of
[41:21] you. Let me try to go back to my sermon
[41:24] tonight and persuade you. Let me cry and
[41:26] beg and roll on the ground and throw
[41:28] dirt in the air. I'll do anything that
[41:30] you need me to do to persuade you
[41:34] to ferveny
[41:36] to to to zealousness.
[41:40] Oh my
[41:42] to we we we've been preaching on
[41:45] sincerity and exploits and the third
[41:47] pole and the spoken word and I have
[41:49] proven to you through eight parts and
[41:51] got a ninth part if I can ever get back
[41:52] to it. And one theme that we have been
[41:56] honest with you from part one and every
[42:00] time we keep mentioning it, this thing
[42:02] takes rededication. We're at the time
[42:05] where the bride's got to lift off the
[42:07] earth and and that's going to take a
[42:09] sincerity. You must be more sincere than
[42:12] you've ever been.
[42:15] Now, you can't make yourself sincere. It
[42:17] wouldn't be sincerity. But what you can
[42:20] do is say, "Very well, Lord." then make
[42:23] me sincere. That's that's the same as
[42:26] saying whatever it takes.
[42:30] Do we have enough honest people in here
[42:32] tonight? Are are their teenagers honest
[42:34] to say, "I want a rapture, Lord.
[42:36] Whatever it takes. I don't even need to
[42:38] know. Just whatever it takes."
[42:43] If you'll have that, then the devil is
[42:46] beat already.
[42:47] Let me encourage you today. You have
[42:49] that kind of desire in your heart, I
[42:51] promise you the devil is already
[42:53] defeated.
[42:55] Hallelujah. Don't let him keep bluffing
[42:57] you.
[42:58] You're already, your feet are already
[42:59] off the ground and you're headed
[43:01] heavenward.
[43:03] So, the sense that there is some
[43:05] approved area, some watered down
[43:07] version, some compromise between good
[43:09] and evil, some watering down between
[43:11] right and wrong, it's a myth. And and
[43:13] and I'm a minister of the gospel of
[43:15] Jesus Christ. and and and and not by the
[43:18] will of man,
[43:19] right?
[43:20] Amen.
[43:20] And not by my own will for sure.
[43:23] Peter says second Peter 1:21, "For the
[43:26] prophecy came not in old time by the
[43:29] will of man, but holy men of God spake
[43:33] as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."
[43:36] as such. Then that being true, then my
[43:39] entire life f friends that has literally
[43:44] been taken over from a young age.
[43:47] Amen.
[43:48] From a just a young boy thinking about
[43:50] God and his word and from a young
[43:52] teenager. And I and I don't not here to
[43:54] try to tell you I had some pious perfect
[43:56] life. I was a sinner saved by grace just
[43:59] like you. And I had my times where I was
[44:01] distant from the Lord and needed to make
[44:03] a full dedication. I I want I I can tell
[44:06] you tonight I'm filled with regret.
[44:08] What? That's not what I expect you to
[44:10] say. I regret that I didn't do it much
[44:12] sooner, much younger.
[44:16] Hallelujah.
[44:21] It's what we've been called to. This
[44:23] ministry team here that God has given
[44:25] us.
[44:27] Amen. They've been called and positioned
[44:29] by God to stand in a public pull pit on
[44:35] public airwaves and confront that
[44:38] fallacy
[44:39] that there is some there is some
[44:42] acceptable compromised area in the word
[44:45] of God. Brothers, we're here to confront
[44:47] that false narrative. That's a myth.
[44:49] That's a lie. That's false. It's not
[44:52] true. And we got to stand like warriors
[44:56] and say there is no compromise. There's
[44:58] no middle ground. There's no watering it
[45:00] down.
[45:02] We've got to be able to show God's
[45:04] thoughts on it from his word. And I I
[45:06] I'm sorry sometimes if if I hurt your
[45:09] feelings and have to say things and
[45:11] you'll never know. You'll never know the
[45:14] agony I go through for days afterward
[45:17] cuz it's so against my nature to be
[45:20] confrontational like that. But all I can
[45:22] tell you is when I get here, I'm not my
[45:24] own. Something takes over and I I'm like
[45:27] Jeremiah. A fire iss burning inside my
[45:31] bones and I can't be silent. God is
[45:34] looking for ferveny.
[45:36] God wants to demonstrate his power in
[45:39] our lives.
[45:42] Amen. That's good.
[45:44] Yes, sir.
[45:44] The voice of many waters. Brother
[45:46] Brandham refers to it out of the book of
[45:49] Revelation talk called it the ministry
[45:52] voice of the ministers through the Holy
[45:54] Spirit that's cried out in every age.
[45:58] And that's what we are.
[46:00] We're a voice. We're we're voices
[46:03] under the voice.
[46:05] Amen.
[46:06] For this age sent by God into the world.
[46:09] Make no apologies for that. It's changed
[46:12] my whole life.
[46:13] It's brought the power of God.
[46:15] People can say what they want, but I
[46:16] know what this message has done to me.
[46:18] And I know the miracles that follow it.
[46:20] And I know the evident evident fruit of
[46:22] the ministry. I see it in your lives.
[46:26] Hallelujah.
[46:28] God sending this mighty prophet to the
[46:30] gentile church. According to scripture,
[46:33] he was to come just before the
[46:35] consummation of the ages, right before
[46:37] the bride goes home. And 2,000 years
[46:40] 2,000 years ago,
[46:43] 2,000 years ago, John saw this prophet
[46:47] from the future.
[46:48] Amen.
[46:48] Met him,
[46:49] talked to him,
[46:51] kept trying to worship him.
[46:53] He the the the nature of that prophet
[46:55] from the future was so familiar to John
[46:58] who had walked with the Lord and leaned
[47:00] on his bosom. John just thought it must
[47:03] be Jesus in another form and he kept
[47:05] collapsing and trying to worship him.
[47:07] And the and the humble prophet from the
[47:09] future kept putting his hand and said,
[47:10] "Don't you worship me.
[47:12] We don't have nothing to do with that
[47:13] deity spirit. That deity spirit ain't in
[47:14] heaven. There's one up there on the
[47:16] throne and that's the only one we
[47:18] worship."
[47:20] Hallelujah.
[47:21] I'm just your brother. I'm a one of the
[47:24] prophets. That's all I am. That's all I
[47:25] want to be.
[47:30] This prophet from the future. If the
[47:32] Bible is to be believed, do you believe
[47:34] it?
[47:35] Amen.
[47:37] If the Bible
[47:40] is to be believed,
[47:43] whoever this man would turn out to be,
[47:47] sure, he was a true messenger.
[47:51] If the Bible is to be believed,
[47:53] absolutely.
[47:54] Whoever this prophet from the future
[47:57] would turn out to be,
[47:59] he would be a true messenger
[48:01] that you can bank on. Amen.
[48:04] Like I say, let let critics say what
[48:06] they will, but the book of Revelation
[48:09] shows that this prophet would be
[48:11] faithful.
[48:13] The book of Revelation shows that he
[48:15] would not lead men to himself, but he
[48:17] would lead them to Christ.
[48:19] The book of Revelation shows that he
[48:21] would not compromise on the word.
[48:25] Amen.
[48:26] Amen. That's right.
[48:27] He would wield the sword of the spirit.
[48:30] Yes,
[48:31] he would actually be given according to
[48:33] the book of Revelation, he would be
[48:35] given authority to initiate the release
[48:38] of the seventh vial upon the earth.
[48:42] A devastating vial,
[48:45] devastating,
[48:46] to be poured out in fullness during the
[48:49] tribulation period after the bride is
[48:50] gone. But don't misunderstand that vial
[48:53] is already cracked open and is already
[48:55] causing the madness. You see, cuz it was
[48:57] released as a as a toxin in the air and
[49:00] men's minds are men's hearts are failing
[49:02] for fear and anxiety for fear of the
[49:05] unknown and the craziness and the
[49:07] insanity that we see. Listen friends,
[49:10] it's not an accident. You see it.
[49:12] I'm not making this up. You see it.
[49:16] The days of Noah where the wickedness of
[49:18] man was great in the earth. So that the
[49:21] imagination that every imagination of
[49:23] the thoughts of his heart was only evil
[49:26] continually.
[49:27] Tell me we're not there.
[49:32] Sodomites breaking down the door.
[49:35] Breaking down the door.
[49:37] Threatening to do violence to have their
[49:39] way. That's scripture.
[49:41] What you're seeing happen out here today
[49:44] is scripture. Right.
[49:47] See
[49:49] the world falling into total chaos is it
[49:53] it's it's not unknown to the people of
[49:56] of the book. It's not unknown to us
[50:00] today. The people who know their God,
[50:02] the people who dare to believe for great
[50:06] exploits. Do you dare? Amen.
[50:10] See,
[50:13] I think we can fairly conclude that
[50:15] whoever this prophet would be,
[50:18] he would certainly have thus sayeth the
[50:19] Lord and I'll take it.
[50:22] I'll take it.
[50:24] Oh yeah.
[50:24] You don't want your portion? Give it to
[50:25] me. I'm a big eater.
[50:28] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[50:30] Tell you something, friends. When Christ
[50:31] stepped from the eternities and took the
[50:33] book and loosed those seals, prophet
[50:36] said he called for his queen. and called
[50:38] for his bride to come and stand by his
[50:40] side. I wonder tonight in this building
[50:43] who's willing to pull their spiritual
[50:45] sword and and steps forward to the side
[50:48] of Christ and say, "I'll take the way
[50:50] with the Lord's despised view, and I'll
[50:52] put down the enemy. That's why I'm here.
[50:55] I'll be a living word. I'll be an
[50:57] example. I will let the mind which was
[51:00] in Christ be in me. I will let the I
[51:03] will let the word dwell in me richly.
[51:11] It is evident from Revelation 10
[51:15] that the word of this prophet from the
[51:17] future
[51:18] would be the final say for establishing
[51:23] judgment in the world.
[51:26] There's no question whoever you say this
[51:29] prophet is, that's the commission he
[51:31] would have.
[51:32] Not only not only to bring life but to
[51:36] bring judgment also because it's the son
[51:38] of man.
[51:39] Jesus prophesied that. See, it's evident
[51:43] from Revelation 10 that he would have
[51:45] the final say for establishing God's
[51:49] provided way of salvation. It's evident
[51:52] from Revelation 17 that his word would
[51:55] be the final say for establishing the
[51:57] judgments in the world. So he's got the
[52:01] authoritative singular voice to show
[52:05] God's provided way of salvation.
[52:08] God's provide God's provided approach.
[52:12] And there's no way to get redemption
[52:14] outside of the message of this prophet
[52:17] from the future.
[52:18] Amen. Right.
[52:21] And chapter 17 shows him with the
[52:23] authority to release that seventh vial,
[52:27] a message from God
[52:30] so accurate and so inspired that it
[52:32] would.
[52:34] It would it would bring forth
[52:38] justifiable
[52:39] judgments.
[52:40] Amen.
[52:41] From God who has to be just.
[52:44] God can't lose his cool.
[52:46] Amen. God can't burn up the world
[52:49] because he gets an attitude.
[52:51] God is judicious.
[52:53] He's fair.
[52:55] He's He's all powerful, but he's also
[52:58] all knowing.
[53:00] And he he's he he has so much
[53:03] understanding that he's not even
[53:05] destroying people for their works. He's
[53:08] destroying them because of their heart,
[53:10] because of their rejection of the word
[53:12] of God.
[53:13] The the the the reward for evil works
[53:16] there. You reap what you sow. Of course,
[53:18] that's nature. That's not something
[53:20] God's got to do at the end time. People
[53:22] constantly reap what they sow.
[53:24] And at the at the end time, it actually
[53:26] won't even be God destroying the world
[53:28] at Armageddon. It'll be man destroying
[53:30] himself. And God will just simply pull
[53:32] the stops out and let the wagon roll off
[53:34] the cliff. Guess what? You're the stops
[53:37] once he pulls you out of the way.
[53:40] Hallelujah.
[53:41] See?
[53:43] And so it it's got to come forth as
[53:45] just. He can't he can't send a man to to
[53:48] judgment without a fair warning.
[53:51] And in his and in his benevolence and
[53:54] the fact that his his throne is
[53:56] established in mercy
[53:59] and that he warns a man over and over
[54:02] and over and over and over and he says
[54:04] to even he says to the world why will
[54:06] you die? Why will you not come to me and
[54:10] live? Even Jesus picks that up and says
[54:12] you won't come to me that you might
[54:14] live. Yeah,
[54:15] I'm here to save you. I'm not here to
[54:17] condemn you. I came not into the world
[54:18] to condemn the world, but to save the
[54:20] world.
[54:23] Say, "Yeah, but his throne is also uh
[54:25] established in judgment." True, but
[54:28] mercy rejoicth against judgment. I want
[54:31] to dance. I want to jump up and down so
[54:32] bad. Mercy rejoicth against judgment.
[54:36] Oh, you might have every kind of failure
[54:38] in your past life. Mercy rejoicth
[54:41] against judgment. You might not be will
[54:44] be worthy to sit here. I'm not worthy to
[54:46] stand here. But mercy rejoices against
[54:50] judgment.
[54:52] Thank you, Lord.
[54:58] You know, they talk about bias in the
[55:00] news and bias in this and bias in that.
[55:04] I mean, you know, I'm I'm not opposed to
[55:07] bias,
[55:09] but I want it to be a bias for truth.
[55:12] Yeah,
[55:13] bias isn't bad in in and of itself. If I
[55:16] want truth and justice, if I want God's
[55:19] word, I'm biased.
[55:22] I'm sorry. I want his opinion over
[55:24] yours.
[55:26] I, you know, I remember brother Bisll
[55:28] told a story one time years ago. I was
[55:30] just a teenager. Man, it made such an
[55:32] impression on me. And some guy starts
[55:34] coming to church, some intellectual guy.
[55:36] He sat quietly for a few services and
[55:39] taking his notes. Finally, he says to
[55:41] Brother Ed, "Hey, can I can I see you in
[55:43] your office?" Sure. Sure. Come on,
[55:45] brother Ed. Very gracious man.
[55:48] And he just said, "You just sit down."
[55:49] And how many times I've sat in that
[55:51] office? And it was just a little double
[55:53] wide trailer back in the log church
[55:55] days. And
[55:59] he says, "Well, you know," and he
[56:01] started going down his notes and his
[56:03] list. He said, "You know, you said this,
[56:04] you taught this and William brought him
[56:06] into this and that and this position."
[56:07] And he said, "I understand that that
[56:09] works for you." He said, he said, "But
[56:11] you know, I just think," and brother Ed
[56:13] just stopped him. He said, "Just a
[56:14] second."
[56:16] And the guy was taken back. And brother
[56:18] Ed said, "Listen, I don't care what you
[56:21] think."
[56:25] I thought, "Man, that's how you cut to
[56:27] the chase.
[56:29] Save yourself agony."
[56:31] Brother said, "I don't care what you
[56:33] think." And the man was like, "What?" He
[56:36] said, ' Listen, I don't care what you
[56:39] think. I don't care what I think.
[56:42] I got a church of 250 people at that
[56:45] time. He said, 'I don't care what they
[56:46] think.
[56:47] Now, if I don't care what they think and
[56:49] I don't care what I think, why do you
[56:52] think I would care what you think?
[56:58] Never saw him again.
[57:03] You know, this this constructed myth
[57:05] that there is some approved area of
[57:07] compromise between good and evil, right
[57:09] and wrong, is an illusion by Satan. It's
[57:11] a deception by Satan. And I'm going to
[57:13] tell you something, friends. I'm going
[57:14] to give you some help tonight. It's a
[57:16] It's an illusion by Satan to try to keep
[57:19] you out of the realities of living in
[57:22] the realities of God,
[57:24] the living realities of the living God.
[57:27] That's where I want to live. That's
[57:29] where I want to put my foot down. That's
[57:31] where I want to raise up out of my bed
[57:33] in the morning thanking him. Go to bed
[57:35] at night thanking him. I want the
[57:37] realities of the living God. I'm not
[57:39] here to breathe in some toxic nonsense
[57:41] that there's some compromised version.
[57:43] There's no compromised version.
[57:48] There's only righteousness. There's only
[57:50] holiness.
[57:51] There's only the word. The word and the
[57:53] word alone. No more man-made creeds.
[57:56] We're done with that. Yeah,
[57:58] we came out of that.
[58:01] Not interested in man's ideology and
[58:03] theology and creeds of men. There's
[58:05] 33,000.
[58:08] How long is that line?
[58:11] Amen.
[58:13] Amen.
[58:13] And I'm crazy
[58:16] really. And somebody says, "Well, I I I
[58:19] just think I I I got to I think
[58:21] differently." Okay, get in line.
[58:25] It's just run for about a couple hours.
[58:27] You'll get to the end of the line and
[58:29] just get in line with 33,000 other
[58:31] opinions. I'm not interested in
[58:33] opinions. God didn't promise to send an
[58:35] opinion.
[58:36] God didn't promise to send what the ages
[58:38] had. We're promised another Ephesians.
[58:42] We're promised another reality of the
[58:44] living God.
[58:48] And it's living reality or bust. It's
[58:50] heaven or bust. It's a rapture or bust.
[58:52] I'm I'm putting all my marbles in it.
[58:55] I'm putting my whole heart in it. I'm
[58:57] banking everything on it.
[59:01] And if I fail, I will still have lived a
[59:03] happier, satisfying life.
[59:06] I've got to keep my money. I've got to
[59:08] keep my health. I've got to keep my
[59:10] reputation and my honor. I didn't I
[59:12] didn't blow all my money on drugs and
[59:14] booze and women and fast living. I
[59:16] didn't wake up with hangovers. I don't
[59:18] have cerosis of the liver. I lived a
[59:20] clean, wholesome life. So even if I
[59:21] lose, I win.
[59:24] Amen.
[59:31] It's a deception.
[59:34] Such a powerful quote.
[59:35] Yeah.
[59:36] Proving and showing that either you have
[59:40] all of Jesus or you don't have any.
[59:43] Amen.
[59:44] You either believe all the word or you
[59:46] believe none of the word. You say,
[59:48] "Well, I I got I got partial." You don't
[59:50] get no credit.
[59:52] That that's unacredited.
[59:54] That ain't gonna do you no good. Go to
[59:55] an unacredited school. Find out what
[59:57] kind of degree you get.
[59:59] Wouldn't be worth much, would it, Doc?
[1:00:03] You think he spent all these years and
[1:00:05] just recently finished his doctorate,
[1:00:07] now he's a an official doctor. You can
[1:00:10] call him Dr. Dr. Ward.
[1:00:13] They're all docs to me.
[1:00:15] You think he would waste his money and
[1:00:17] time and resources in something
[1:00:19] unacredited?
[1:00:21] No way, man. It it doesn't matter. We
[1:00:25] can have all kinds of opinions,
[1:00:28] you know, long and short and high and
[1:00:29] low. And I get it. I'm I'm not I I I get
[1:00:33] that we're all at various spiritual
[1:00:35] levels. And I'm I I'm good with that. I
[1:00:38] can work with that. You know, especially
[1:00:41] those of you who were I think we're we
[1:00:44] were count trying to count it the other
[1:00:45] day. We're our fifth or sixth or seventh
[1:00:48] generation of teenagers started back in
[1:00:51] 1995. My boys were the first gen and
[1:00:54] then we've kind of went and every level
[1:00:56] up after that and level two, you know,
[1:00:58] generation two, three, four. I think
[1:01:00] we're at five or six or seven somewhere
[1:01:02] around in there.
[1:01:03] And and you know something I you you you
[1:01:06] they've all heard me say and if you're
[1:01:08] here, you started out in that little
[1:01:10] group, those young teenagers, and now
[1:01:12] you're an adult, you've heard brother
[1:01:13] Jason say it for years. I'm not about
[1:01:15] wins and losses.
[1:01:17] It's not my nature. I don't look at the
[1:01:19] W and the L columns of your life.
[1:01:23] I'm not worried about have you had this
[1:01:24] many wins and this many losses or, you
[1:01:26] know, are you are you are you batting?
[1:01:28] Are you at 500? Are you less? Are you
[1:01:30] losing? I don't care about that. I'm
[1:01:32] only looking for the fight
[1:01:35] because I got wins and losses, but I got
[1:01:37] to fight.
[1:01:38] And that's why I tell the teenagers,
[1:01:40] just be willing to fight. Come on. Come
[1:01:43] on. We're almost home. Be willing to
[1:01:47] fight.
[1:01:48] Hallelujah. You might fall down. Get
[1:01:50] back up.
[1:01:53] Oh my. There's nothing to quit here.
[1:01:56] We're not quitting. We're not quitters.
[1:01:58] I'm pressing on.
[1:02:01] Hallelujah.
[1:02:02] Not interested in Satan's deception.
[1:02:04] It's smokec screen. You receive all of
[1:02:07] his word and its benefits or you receive
[1:02:09] none of them and he owes you nothing.
[1:02:12] Let me say that again. You you you
[1:02:15] receive all of his word and and and its
[1:02:19] benefits or you receive none of him and
[1:02:23] he owes you nothing. Amen.
[1:02:27] You're not going to make a case to me
[1:02:29] that the offended owes the offender
[1:02:32] something.
[1:02:35] Why don't you just play the victim?
[1:02:38] God owes me. Huh?
[1:02:42] He died for you
[1:02:44] and you still don't serve him.
[1:02:46] What? What do you think he owes you?
[1:02:50] Oh, somebody hurt my feelings. Who? Paul
[1:02:52] said, "Listen, why don't you just
[1:02:54] consider him
[1:02:56] one time? Whenever you get your feelings
[1:02:58] hurt, your sucker licked on the wrong
[1:02:59] side, just consider him who endured such
[1:03:04] contradiction
[1:03:05] against himself by sinners
[1:03:08] that God I'm going to tell you a
[1:03:10] shocking but true story. You ready? God
[1:03:14] traded a man that was completely
[1:03:17] innocent
[1:03:18] for an entire world of filthy, rotten,
[1:03:22] guilty people.
[1:03:25] Amen.
[1:03:25] And and this man spent his whole life
[1:03:28] pleasing the father. Spent his whole
[1:03:30] life not only was he, as I've said to
[1:03:32] you before, he's our total satisfaction.
[1:03:34] He's he's not just the atonement. He he
[1:03:36] he was the atonement because he was the
[1:03:39] worthy lamb. But but that was that
[1:03:42] wasn't all that was required because
[1:03:44] remember when brother Brandham in uh is
[1:03:48] the rising of the sun and he talks about
[1:03:50] Jesus coming up out of the grave. What a
[1:03:52] glorious day. There had been many men
[1:03:54] died even for a good cause but never
[1:03:57] remember that. But there had never been
[1:03:58] a man
[1:03:59] who could lay his own life down and pick
[1:04:01] it back up again.
[1:04:04] Said it was the answer to man's
[1:04:06] question. It was the answer to Job's
[1:04:08] question. If a man die, can he live
[1:04:10] again? Is there chance? Is there hope?
[1:04:12] Yes.
[1:04:13] I know my redeemer liveth.
[1:04:17] Someday I'll see him. I'm here to tell
[1:04:18] you, someday I'm going to be with John
[1:04:21] around the throne. Someday I'm going to
[1:04:23] see him.
[1:04:26] And and brother Bam says, "Now that was
[1:04:28] great for Jesus that he rose from the
[1:04:30] dead, but what's that got to do with me?
[1:04:33] Come on. I haven't even went to Calvary
[1:04:35] to say nothing of being killed and
[1:04:37] raising from the raising myself from the
[1:04:38] dead, which I can't even do
[1:04:41] and probably wouldn't pass the Pilate's
[1:04:43] judgment hall test.
[1:04:45] Peter didn't.
[1:04:48] Just saying.
[1:04:49] John didn't. Loved him more than all of
[1:04:51] them. He didn't pass it. He ran in the
[1:04:53] ran off in the garden. Ran off like a
[1:04:55] crazy man. Left Jesus. Thought they're
[1:04:57] alone.
[1:05:01] And so so so so when you think of it in
[1:05:04] that way here God comes and and and
[1:05:09] takes this man who was totally
[1:05:12] absolutely completely innocent
[1:05:16] who not only was the the worthy lamb to
[1:05:20] be the atonement for sin
[1:05:23] but there was something called the
[1:05:25] perceptive side of the word because you
[1:05:28] remember It must be line upon line,
[1:05:31] precept upon precept.
[1:05:34] So there had to be somebody live. This
[1:05:38] is great that he was the atonement that
[1:05:39] he came out of the tomb. But there had
[1:05:42] to be also somebody lived the preceptive
[1:05:44] sight of the word flawlessly, perfectly
[1:05:47] so I could get credit for it.
[1:05:50] You understand? He hasn't just saved me
[1:05:52] and left me a vagabond. He gave me the
[1:05:54] righteousness of Jesus Christ and put it
[1:05:57] on me and took my sinful filthy robes
[1:06:00] and put it on him.
[1:06:02] The prophet said, "God condemned him as
[1:06:04] a sinner. He who knew no sin, God
[1:06:08] condemned him as a sinner and sent him
[1:06:11] to hell so you wouldn't have to go and I
[1:06:13] wouldn't have to go." You say, "Oh, that
[1:06:15] was terrible." But the Bible says of
[1:06:17] Jesus during his worst moments when the
[1:06:20] affliction was and the pain was so
[1:06:22] searing, the Bible said he will see his
[1:06:25] seed and be satisfied.
[1:06:27] I'm telling you, when he was on the
[1:06:29] cross, I was in his view.
[1:06:31] You were in his view.
[1:06:39] He's not obligated to credit any of your
[1:06:41] good works or deeds of piety. Listen
[1:06:44] friends, you'll you'll come God's
[1:06:46] provided way or perish with the
[1:06:48] unbelievers.
[1:06:50] Sorry I don't have a curtain B.
[1:06:53] I'm sorry. There is no such a thing as a
[1:06:56] compromised area.
[1:06:58] You either have all of Christ or none of
[1:07:00] him.
[1:07:01] You either believe all the word of God
[1:07:03] or you perish with the unbelievers.
[1:07:05] See,
[1:07:07] so
[1:07:08] James,
[1:07:10] let me try to wind up here.
[1:07:14] can't finish. So, let me just try to go
[1:07:17] to the bottom of the hour.
[1:07:20] So, Jame James
[1:07:23] shows the reality between God and Satan.
[1:07:27] And it's not dismal.
[1:07:31] It's not murky.
[1:07:33] It's not undefined.
[1:07:36] The age is dismal.
[1:07:38] The age we live in is dismal.
[1:07:40] Absolutely.
[1:07:41] The age we live in is loose.
[1:07:43] The age we live in is compromised. But
[1:07:46] not the word.
[1:07:48] The word is not dismal. God sent you and
[1:07:50] broke the seals and the mighty God has
[1:07:53] been unveiled. There is no nothing you
[1:07:56] can lean back on. Just just get over
[1:07:58] your laziness. Get over your
[1:08:00] travelingness and say, "Lord God, come
[1:08:02] down into my heart tonight and lift me
[1:08:05] up above the shadows and cause me to
[1:08:08] soar in the heavenlies.
[1:08:11] The word is stark and the word is clear
[1:08:14] and unbelief of uh you know of of the
[1:08:18] whole is sharply defined I would say as
[1:08:22] anything
[1:08:24] that takes away any part of the word of
[1:08:27] God. The unbelief I want to say it again
[1:08:31] unbelief is very sharply defined. It's
[1:08:34] not a, you know, you can't, it's not
[1:08:36] camouflaged.
[1:08:38] Say, uh, you know, is this wrong? Is
[1:08:40] this wrong? Is this wrong? Is this
[1:08:41] wrong? Brother Brandham just had such a
[1:08:43] simple hillbilly answer for that. He
[1:08:46] said, my my first question, Brother
[1:08:49] Brandham, is this wrong? Can I do this?
[1:08:50] He said, my first question is, why do
[1:08:52] you have a question?
[1:08:54] If you have a question, don't do it.
[1:08:58] Pretty simple.
[1:08:59] See why? Why? Why question? Why? Why
[1:09:02] walk along the edge, man? I want to stay
[1:09:04] as far away from that edge as I can.
[1:09:08] And and so so we we find out that that
[1:09:11] unbelief
[1:09:13] of the entire word of God and how you
[1:09:16] become culpable in that and flatly and
[1:09:20] fully guilty
[1:09:22] is is it's defined as anything that sets
[1:09:26] aside even one word of God. This is how
[1:09:29] valuable God's words are. So you you I'm
[1:09:34] sure that you can have some appreciation
[1:09:40] why we will not allow from this pull pit
[1:09:45] this message to be compromised.
[1:09:47] Amen.
[1:09:48] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:49] And it doesn't matter to us as a
[1:09:51] ministry team.
[1:09:53] It doesn't matter to us that this is the
[1:09:55] 21st century. It's still God's word.
[1:09:58] And it doesn't matter to us that the
[1:10:00] whole world is doing it. We're not over
[1:10:01] the world.
[1:10:04] Amen.
[1:10:05] See, this is how valuable God's words
[1:10:07] are. You can't Jesus taught us that you
[1:10:10] can't even dismiss a jot or a tit or an
[1:10:12] iota. And we're talking, we're getting
[1:10:15] down to punctuation.
[1:10:17] Amen.
[1:10:17] You can't you can't dismiss anything.
[1:10:20] Stop living Let me say it tonight as I
[1:10:22] wind toward a close. Stop living under
[1:10:25] an illusion that Satan is telling you
[1:10:28] that God's word doesn't matter as an
[1:10:31] absolute. I'm here to tell you that's a
[1:10:34] lie. It matters.
[1:10:38] 100% of his word matters to him 100% of
[1:10:42] the time.
[1:10:45] Break out of this dismal day, friends.
[1:10:48] Great light has come to our day. Do you
[1:10:49] believe it?
[1:10:51] It's a day. It's a day that can't be
[1:10:53] called day or night. But God has
[1:10:56] promised that he will come down in this
[1:10:58] dismal day and define right and wrong.
[1:11:02] And he will show the difference. And the
[1:11:04] Bible says he will make a difference.
[1:11:07] Amen.
[1:11:08] And people can call it bias if they want
[1:11:10] to, but he will come down and make a
[1:11:12] difference between those who believe his
[1:11:14] word and those who don't. See? And so,
[1:11:18] so you know, I I I I just want to say to
[1:11:21] you today as we get ready to go off the
[1:11:24] air that
[1:11:25] you've been called to something
[1:11:27] fantastic.
[1:11:30] And I want to challenge you tonight to
[1:11:32] absorb that. That this isn't some
[1:11:35] willy-nilly thing that was done in a
[1:11:37] corner. God expended great effort, great
[1:11:40] resources,
[1:11:42] and wore out lives and ministers and
[1:11:44] preachers and and has went down through
[1:11:47] time in this last day to give to give
[1:11:49] mankind one last chance. One the the
[1:11:54] world is getting their last opportunity
[1:11:57] to see this live in flesh.
[1:12:00] They're not seeing it in William
[1:12:01] Brandham. He's gone. They're seeing it
[1:12:03] in the continuation of Mrs. Jesus
[1:12:06] Christ. That's the brideg
[1:12:08] you've been fed on the word that he
[1:12:10] brought to you that he got from God
[1:12:12] according to the Bible.
[1:12:13] I mean, if the Bible's to be believed,
[1:12:15] that that's incontrovertible.
[1:12:18] See,
[1:12:19] you might dismiss it like you would
[1:12:21] other things in the scripture, but when
[1:12:23] I read it, I it's very clear to me. Yes.
[1:12:26] See, and so so I wanted to say to you
[1:12:28] that however, however we we think we are
[1:12:32] soaring,
[1:12:35] can I say to you that you're called to
[1:12:36] go even higher.
[1:12:39] Amen.
[1:12:40] However proud you are of yourself, that
[1:12:43] you have let go of things of the world,
[1:12:45] the spirit of God is calling for a total
[1:12:50] separation from unbelief. Amen.
[1:12:53] A total separation.
[1:12:55] I just got to labor on that. The Holy
[1:12:57] Spirit just drilling holes in me. You're
[1:13:00] called to go higher.
[1:13:02] Don't settle for anything less than
[1:13:04] higher.
[1:13:05] Say, how high? Higher than that.
[1:13:07] Well, how high is that? Higher still.
[1:13:10] Hallelujah. All the way till a body
[1:13:12] change, friend.
[1:13:14] I'm not here to boast and be proud of
[1:13:16] what I've overcome. I overcame nothing.
[1:13:19] Was headed to hell and I couldn't do
[1:13:21] anything about it. But grace, but God,
[1:13:24] but Christ, but the word.
[1:13:27] Hallelujah.
[1:13:29] Oh my. The spirit of God is not calling
[1:13:32] for you just to make a few changes in
[1:13:34] your life. It's not calling for you just
[1:13:36] to say, "God sent a prophet." It's
[1:13:38] calling on you to be the living
[1:13:40] embodiment of the word of God in this
[1:13:42] day, in this hour.
[1:13:44] Now, who's ready to pull out their
[1:13:46] spiritual sword and stand to your feet
[1:13:49] and say, "I'll take the way with the
[1:13:51] Lord despised you."
[1:13:53] He's called for his queen to stand by
[1:13:55] his side. Here I come, Lord. I'm going
[1:13:58] to stand by your side and defy the world
[1:14:02] and defy this sodomite age and defy this
[1:14:04] days of Noah and say, "Christ is here.
[1:14:08] He's not coming. He's among us.
[1:14:12] Amen.
[1:14:14] Yes, sir.
[1:14:15] Hallelujah.
[1:14:17] Let the redeemed say so.
[1:14:20] So be it, Lord. Let's raise up those
[1:14:22] eagle wings. Say, "Amen."
[1:14:25] Amen to the word. Let the Lord hear you
[1:14:27] say, "Amen to the word."
[1:14:30] Amen.
[1:14:32] Oh, hallelujah, Lord.
[1:14:36] Bow your heads with me, friends.
[1:14:40] Lord, I'm going to stop because I'm at
[1:14:42] the point where I can't control it any
[1:14:43] longer. So, I'm just going to stop right
[1:14:46] here.
[1:14:47] We're going to move to prayer. But Lord,
[1:14:49] oh, your word, your word, your word,
[1:14:53] your presence. It's so strong,
[1:14:56] Lord. I'm I'm an oracle. I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:15:00] here to deliver your message to these
[1:15:02] people. Hallelujah. Don't let anyone go
[1:15:07] from this building tonight thinking they
[1:15:09] can live in some imaginary land of
[1:15:11] compromise.
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:14] There is no such thing. That's a myth.
[1:15:18] That's a mist. That's a fog. That's
[1:15:21] that's that's a that's an illusion.
[1:15:25] You either have all of him or you have
[1:15:26] none of him.
[1:15:29] You either take all of his word and then
[1:15:31] you're entitled to everything
[1:15:34] or you reject any part of it and he owes
[1:15:36] you nothing.
[1:15:39] Lord God, I stand here tonight with
[1:15:41] these people. I want to raise up my both
[1:15:44] hands and say, Lord, I'm unworthy also,
[1:15:47] but I'm here to thank you for your
[1:15:49] grace. I'm here to thank you for your
[1:15:51] word. I'm here to thank you that you
[1:15:54] don't quit. You don't give up on me. You
[1:15:57] never gave up.
[1:15:58] Oh lamb of God, I stand here tonight and
[1:16:01] I just say, "I love you. I love you,
[1:16:04] Lord." Brother Luther started us at the
[1:16:06] beginning of the service by saying,
[1:16:08] "Lord, I love you." Now, we're going to
[1:16:10] come to the end. Lord, we're going to
[1:16:11] say it. Lord, I love you.
[1:16:13] Lord, I love you. Lord, I love you. I
[1:16:15] love your word. I love everything about
[1:16:17] you. We're so sorry, Father, for
[1:16:21] any times in our lives where we've
[1:16:24] somehow allowed the word to fall to the
[1:16:26] ground. We didn't take the stand for it.
[1:16:27] that we should have. Lord, don't let
[1:16:29] that don't let anyone leave here in that
[1:16:32] condition.
[1:16:35] May the word have some effect on the
[1:16:37] people, not just to affect us. Lord,
[1:16:42] I'm I appreciate the effect. It's makes
[1:16:45] preaching easier and people become
[1:16:48] enthused with me and they catch the
[1:16:50] vision with me and they go up into the
[1:16:52] atmospheres of anointing with me and
[1:16:53] it's wonderful. But eventually we got to
[1:16:56] leave this building and go back out into
[1:16:58] the real world. And is there going to be
[1:16:59] an effective change,
[1:17:04] an effective change
[1:17:07] that I wasn't just affected, but I
[1:17:10] wasffected
[1:17:13] and it made a difference in my life.
[1:17:15] Lord, I I know I know there's got to be
[1:17:18] you wouldn't have put this sermon on my
[1:17:20] heart. I know it's ministering to your
[1:17:22] people tonight.
[1:17:24] not only in this building but out across
[1:17:27] the airwaves, Lord, people who are
[1:17:29] streaming live, people who are here on
[1:17:31] an archive.
[1:17:33] I thank you for it. I thank you for your
[1:17:35] love to us. Now Lord
[1:17:39] I just before we go to physical prayer
[1:17:43] with all heads bowed now all eyes closed
[1:17:51] I'm going to ask you but wait till I
[1:17:52] tell you what the reason I'm going to
[1:17:55] give you an opportunity to raise your
[1:17:57] hand to the Lord
[1:18:00] but I want it to be for this reason
[1:18:03] that when you raise your hand you'll be
[1:18:06] saying to the Lord, "Tonight,
[1:18:10] the word found me out
[1:18:13] and I I want to move higher."
[1:18:18] Tonight, the word found me out and I
[1:18:21] find that I want to move higher.
[1:18:24] Now, if you'd like for Jesus to see
[1:18:27] that, you raise up that hand to him
[1:18:29] right now. Lord, you found me out
[1:18:33] tonight and I want to move higher.
[1:18:36] You founded me out. Lord, I got too
[1:18:39] comfortable and you're calling me
[1:18:41] higher. You're calling me upward. Upward
[1:18:43] and onward and upward.
[1:18:45] Amen.
[1:18:46] The bride in an order of ascending. It's
[1:18:49] what the last thing the prophet saw last
[1:18:51] thing preview of the bride.
[1:18:55] He said that group of painted Jezebels
[1:19:01] said they marched on past and said they
[1:19:03] went off the edge of the cliff and
[1:19:05] plunged down into the canyon floor. He
[1:19:07] said, "You've never heard such screams
[1:19:09] in your life as they plunged to their
[1:19:12] death following a witch."
[1:19:15] He said, "But that little sainted bunch
[1:19:17] of little girls, smooth, clean, marching
[1:19:19] to the step of the gospel, said instead
[1:19:22] of going down, she started going up."
[1:19:24] Hallelujah.
[1:19:26] And even two or three of them that had
[1:19:28] got out of step and all a prophet had to
[1:19:29] say was, "Get back in step." And he
[1:19:31] said, "When I come out of the vision,
[1:19:33] they they were hurrying to get back in
[1:19:36] step." Oh, I'm hurrying tonight, Lord,
[1:19:39] to get back in step.
[1:19:42] I thank you now.
[1:19:44] Oh, every hand that went up, may you
[1:19:48] meet that need. May you meet that person
[1:19:51] honest in their heart tonight. And if
[1:19:54] there's anybody here who wants to make a
[1:19:56] new beginning, maybe you've never made a
[1:19:58] beginning yet. You've looked at Christ.
[1:20:01] You've thought about it. But maybe
[1:20:03] tonight some supernatural being was
[1:20:06] standing closer than you expected and
[1:20:09] you feel impacted by it
[1:20:12] and you'd like to raise a hand and say,
[1:20:14] "Preacher, I want you to pray for me
[1:20:16] that God will somehow have mercy on me."
[1:20:18] You want to raise up that hand to him?
[1:20:20] I'll pray for you. God bless you. God
[1:20:23] bless you, brother. God bless you,
[1:20:24] sister. God bless you, young man.
[1:20:26] Brother, sister, God bless you, sister
[1:20:28] in the back. God bless you. God sees
[1:20:30] that hand. God sees that, Lord. This is
[1:20:33] why we preach. This is what the gospel
[1:20:36] is given for. This is what the Holy
[1:20:37] Ghost is given for. Oh Lord God, take
[1:20:40] now take control.
[1:20:43] Move among these people, Lord God. Cause
[1:20:46] hearts to come to know you in a real and
[1:20:48] meaningful way who have never known you
[1:20:50] and those who have known you and they're
[1:20:52] being called higher. They're being
[1:20:53] summoned, come up higher. Come up
[1:20:55] higher. Come up, John. I saw a door
[1:20:59] opened in heaven. Come up higher. Come
[1:21:02] up into the sunlight of God's word.
[1:21:05] Breathe fresh, clean air. Soar like the
[1:21:08] eagle on the currents of faith.
[1:21:12] We love you for that, Lord God. We thank
[1:21:14] you for this service tonight. I give it
[1:21:16] into your hands in Jesus name. What are
[1:21:19] you going to sing? Brother Anthony
[1:21:28] in me.
[1:21:30] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:21:35] I give you my soul.
[1:21:38] Oh yes.
[1:21:41] I live for you alone.
[1:21:47] Every breath that I take.
[1:21:51] Hallelujah.
[1:21:52] Every moment I'm awake.
[1:21:56] Lord have
[1:21:58] Lord have your way.
[1:22:04] Lord I give you my heart.
[1:22:07] Oh, let's wave to him now. I give him a
[1:22:10] wave offering.
[1:22:12] Make it a sacrifice. Wave at him. Lord,
[1:22:15] I live for you alone.
[1:22:21] Every breath that I take.
[1:22:25] Every moment I'm awake.
[1:22:30] Lord have
[1:22:32] Lord have your way.
[1:22:37] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:22:42] I give you my soul.
[1:22:44] Oh, that's beautiful, friends. Oh,
[1:22:46] you're singing good.
[1:22:48] I live. Come on, let me hear you alone.
[1:22:54] Every
[1:22:56] day,
[1:22:57] there it is. Come on, put it out there.
[1:23:00] I will wait.
[1:23:02] Let him hear it. Let Jesus hear it. Lord
[1:23:05] have your way in me.
[1:23:12] This is my desire. This
[1:23:17] [Music]
[1:23:19] is my
[1:23:21] desire.
[1:23:24] Come on, sing it. to honor
[1:23:30] you
[1:23:34] Lord with all
[1:23:37] my heart
[1:23:40] I worship you.
[1:23:46] Hallelujah.
[1:23:49] All
[1:23:51] I have
[1:23:53] within me
[1:23:56] [Applause]
[1:23:58] I hear
[1:24:00] [Music]
[1:24:02] praise
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:06] and all that I
[1:24:10] adore
[1:24:12] is
[1:24:14] in you.
[1:24:18] Oh
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:24] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:24:28] I give you my soul.
[1:24:34] I live for you alone.
[1:24:40] Every breath that I take,
[1:24:44] every moment I
[1:24:51] Lord,
[1:24:56] Lord,
[1:25:00] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:25:05] I give you my soul.
[1:25:11] I live for you alone
[1:25:17] every breath that I
[1:25:21] every moment I
[1:25:27] Lord have
[1:25:31] to
[1:25:34] [Music]
[1:25:40] This is my
[1:25:43] desire
[1:25:47] to honor
[1:25:52] you
[1:25:53] [Music]
[1:25:57] with all my
[1:26:01] I worship you.
[1:26:05] Move it tight now.
[1:26:10] All I have all I have
[1:26:15] within me.
[1:26:18] All I give I give
[1:26:22] you
[1:26:23] away.
[1:26:26] Oh,
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:29] I

[1:27:19] Sister Elizabeth Johnson writes,
[1:27:22] "Good morning. I have a very special
[1:27:24] prayer request for a very dear friend of
[1:27:25] mine, Victoria,
[1:27:28] who found a lump that is tender to the
[1:27:30] touch under her armpit. I am believing
[1:27:33] that by his stripes she is healed and
[1:27:36] that this lump is nothing that should be
[1:27:38] concerning in the name of Jesus. Please
[1:27:40] have the saints agree with me in prayer
[1:27:44] on this matter. How many agreeers?
[1:27:47] Amen.
[1:27:48] Sister Hope writes, oh well actually
[1:27:50] this already got actually already got
[1:27:51] met. This is going to be a testimony.
[1:27:53] Now, remember that. Um, wow. So, I won't
[1:27:57] tell you the testimony. I'm just going
[1:27:59] to tell you that Lillian was really up
[1:28:01] against it today for her nursing her
[1:28:03] final nursing test. And if she failed it
[1:28:05] and she was sure she had cuz the the the
[1:28:09] the professor was not kind.
[1:28:13] 25 students I think failed
[1:28:18] and she was asking for urgent prayer.
[1:28:22] Amen. Please pray. She says, uh,
[1:28:26] immediate prayer from brother Jason and
[1:28:28] also a prayer request. Amen. So, we'll
[1:28:32] get to that testimony in just in a
[1:28:34] minute. I'll leave you on a cliffhanger.
[1:28:37] Um, Sister Martha Watkins, my Martha.
[1:28:41] Um,
[1:28:42] hey, uh, so she's this is u a friend.
[1:28:46] So, it says um she is she's one we
[1:28:50] prayed about that has the rare cancer.
[1:28:54] And so, oh, here's her name, Amanda
[1:28:56] Thompson.
[1:28:58] And we're going to get a prayer cloth
[1:28:59] tonight. And this cancer, we started
[1:29:02] praying for it. They Martha's never
[1:29:04] taken her a prayer cloth yet tonight.
[1:29:06] So, we're going to take that next step.
[1:29:07] It has now spread over her entire body.
[1:29:10] They haven't given her much hope. And
[1:29:12] that's just the kind of case the Lord is
[1:29:14] good at. Amen,
[1:29:16] man. When all hope is gone. Wow. Oh, he
[1:29:19] just, you know what he does sometimes?
[1:29:21] He'll let that happen just so he can
[1:29:23] come riding in on a white horse and save
[1:29:25] the princess.
[1:29:26] Oh, like a hero on Slay the Dragon. Save
[1:29:30] the Save the Queen. Oh my.
[1:29:33] You say, "Is he dramatic like that?" You
[1:29:35] better believe it. Brother Brandham said
[1:29:38] the whole thing to him was a drama.
[1:29:41] She's asking all her prayer warriors.
[1:29:44] Prayer uh for all prayer prayer
[1:29:46] warriors. She is really scared in a lot
[1:29:48] of pain. She has two kids at school ages
[1:29:52] 12 and eight. Man,
[1:29:54] I just told her, I said, Martha, she's
[1:29:57] telling me and Matt about it today. I
[1:29:58] said, I think it's time for another
[1:30:00] cancer miracle.
[1:30:02] We had a bunch of those.
[1:30:04] Hallelujah. So, we're going to pray and
[1:30:07] uh let me get my prayer cloth before I
[1:30:08] forget it. So, let me gather my
[1:30:10] ministers up here in front of me.
[1:30:11] Martha, come up to the center here.
[1:30:13] Where you at, honey? Where's she at?
[1:30:15] Okay.
[1:30:17] All right. Make way, guys. Step this
[1:30:19] way. Seth, right here. Put your hand on
[1:30:22] it. Now, ministers, gather here with me.
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:32] Father, in the name of Jesus,
[1:30:35] Lord, we're calling you on the scene for
[1:30:37] this urgent case. It's very dire, Lord.
[1:30:40] But not for you. Only for doctors.
[1:30:42] Lord, your the mercy that you sent with
[1:30:45] doctors and medicine can't can't beat
[1:30:47] that devil back. He's going to take her
[1:30:49] life if you don't move. Lord, we're
[1:30:51] asking mercy for this woman with
[1:30:53] children like that, Lord. And asking for
[1:30:55] prayer, ready to give you glory. I pray,
[1:30:58] master, that when this prayer cloth is
[1:31:00] laid upon her body, that the enemy would
[1:31:02] run for the heels, Lord. I pray that
[1:31:05] she'd be made completely whole and give
[1:31:07] testimony and glory to God in Jesus
[1:31:10] name. Amen. All right, honey. You You
[1:31:13] take that. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[1:31:16] Now, put your hand on somebody. Take
[1:31:18] them by the hand. Let's pray over this
[1:31:20] need for sister Elizabeth. She has a
[1:31:22] friend in this situation. Don't yet know
[1:31:25] what it is, but let's just go ahead and
[1:31:26] send the Holy Spirit to take care of it
[1:31:28] right now. Father,
[1:31:31] in the name of the Son of God, the Lord
[1:31:33] Jesus Christ, we join with our sister
[1:31:36] Elizabeth. And that's all she's asked
[1:31:38] for. She said, "Would you join with me
[1:31:40] and agree with me in prayer that God
[1:31:44] will make this as nothing? We speak it.
[1:31:47] We call it as so. We ask it of thee in
[1:31:49] the name of Jesus Christ." Lord, that
[1:31:52] name above all names, that name upon
[1:31:55] which the whole kingdom is built. Lord,
[1:31:57] that name of Jesus Christ, we ask this
[1:32:01] of thee, this special grace and favor in
[1:32:04] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:32:06] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:32:10] Praise the Lord. I don't Let's see. I
[1:32:11] don't have a Oh, over here.
[1:32:16] Sister hope step to get this.
[1:32:20] Uh, doesn't look like anything came on,
[1:32:22] guys, but I don't know.
[1:32:28] That did it.
[1:32:30] Pass that straight back. She's go back.
[1:32:37] You want me to finish that testimony?
[1:32:39] Finish it. You can add drama to it.
[1:32:41] Okay. Well, my sister Anna, you know,
[1:32:44] uh, she called me today before she even
[1:32:48] posted anything on the family chat. She
[1:32:50] said, "Hope right now. You've got to
[1:32:52] pray right now and text Brother Jason.
[1:32:55] he's got to pray right now and then have
[1:32:57] him put in a prayer request at church.
[1:33:01] Of course, she told the story about
[1:33:02] Lillian. And this um professor is known
[1:33:07] to be like a monster. I just relishes in
[1:33:12] tripping up the students and um
[1:33:16] finding ways to fail them. At least
[1:33:18] that's the way it seems to the students.
[1:33:20] and her tests are infamous for um having
[1:33:24] tons of material that uh it was not
[1:33:28] studied for. And so Lillian called her
[1:33:32] mother and said, "Mom, you've you've got
[1:33:36] to do something. You've got to reach out
[1:33:39] because uh God's got to come on the
[1:33:42] scene and he's got to because I I
[1:33:44] already took the test. There's
[1:33:46] absolutely no way I passed it." and
[1:33:51] hearing her talk after the fact on the
[1:33:53] phone to her mom, she said, "Mom, it was
[1:33:55] like I've it was like I've studied 12
[1:33:59] hours a day for weeks and it was like I
[1:34:02] didn't study at all." And so she said,
[1:34:06] "Um, you've got to reach out. You've got
[1:34:08] God's got to intercede because there's
[1:34:11] no other way."
[1:34:12] And um before you know it, I mean, she
[1:34:15] had our whole family praying too. Before
[1:34:18] you know it, we got word she passed
[1:34:20] with, I think, an 81.
[1:34:22] Oh my.
[1:34:22] When 25 other students failed.
[1:34:25] Yeah.
[1:34:25] Hallelujah.
[1:34:27] Hallelujah.
[1:34:31] And she would have uh had to take a
[1:34:33] whole year over.
[1:34:34] Yeah. If she would have failed it, she
[1:34:36] would have had to take a whole another
[1:34:37] year. Woo. Wow. Praise the Lord. Anybody
[1:34:41] else got a testimony? Oh, you, John?
[1:34:44] Okay. All right. There you go.
[1:34:47] Hold on, Matt.
[1:34:50] Um, I wanted to give this last
[1:34:53] Wednesday, but we had gotten sick, so we
[1:34:55] didn't make it. Uh, to make a really,
[1:34:57] really long story as short as I can. Um,
[1:35:01] years ago, there was a terrible trauma
[1:35:03] that happened in our family. And, um, I
[1:35:07] suffered under a spirit of fear and
[1:35:10] torment for months, months.
[1:35:13] and uh at the time and uh the Lord
[1:35:17] helped me with it and well whenever we
[1:35:20] had Hazel with that trauma and the the
[1:35:23] stress and all that all of that it was
[1:35:25] trying to come back and I had talked to
[1:35:27] brother Jason about it and he told me
[1:35:29] you know do this and that and I was
[1:35:32] doing pretty good and here lately I was
[1:35:34] thinking you know
[1:35:37] I don't want to have to deal with that
[1:35:40] again I was just kind of in the back of
[1:35:42] my mind Well, you know, the Lord works
[1:35:45] in ways we don't even we weren't
[1:35:47] expecting. Brother Andrew came here the
[1:35:49] other weekend and um it wasn't on my
[1:35:52] heart that I need to get that taken care
[1:35:56] of. I need to get that fear that
[1:36:00] that fear of that. I won't elaborate too
[1:36:03] much, but it was just the fear you're
[1:36:05] going to lose it. You're going to, you
[1:36:07] know, you're going to be an insane
[1:36:09] institution. That's what it pretty much
[1:36:11] what it was.
[1:36:12] And um I wasn't on my heart, but I
[1:36:17] didn't realize that God was on the job.
[1:36:21] And I found out the next day
[1:36:24] that God set a trap. I believe in my
[1:36:26] heart that's what he did. And
[1:36:30] at that Saturday service,
[1:36:33] you know, Brother Andrew was preaching
[1:36:35] right on that lines, the fear and all
[1:36:36] that. And I'm sitting in there in there
[1:36:38] in the back and I'm like, "Oh man, oh
[1:36:42] that there's that there's that there."
[1:36:44] It's trying to, you know, raise his head
[1:36:46] again. Got up to the platform and I'm up
[1:36:48] here like, "What am I going to do?" I
[1:36:50] was like, "I'm going up." I like you, I
[1:36:53] ain't dealing with this. This is
[1:36:55] nonsense. Like God's call come to
[1:36:57] deliver. I wasn't expecting it, but then
[1:37:00] I'm going to whatever the Lord wants,
[1:37:02] let's do it. and I stepped up, told
[1:37:05] brother Andrew, I need get rid of this
[1:37:08] and uh he prayed and of course I didn't
[1:37:11] feel any different but I was like Lord
[1:37:13] I'm going to trust you and believe you.
[1:37:15] We on the way home I told Meredith I was
[1:37:16] like I didn't feel a thing. Nothing felt
[1:37:19] like it changed. I come back up to the
[1:37:21] platform still under that. I was like
[1:37:23] but I'm delivered and that's my
[1:37:25] testimony. I don't care what I'm I'm I
[1:37:27] believe. Yeah.
[1:37:29] Well, the next day, Sunday, and you ever
[1:37:32] had one of those services, it just seems
[1:37:34] like everything is just pecks here and
[1:37:37] there and you're distracted and your
[1:37:39] daughter screams. And we got in the car
[1:37:41] to go home. I told Meredith, "Man, you
[1:37:43] ever have one of those services? You
[1:37:44] seem like you don't get anything. You
[1:37:45] better off have to stay home." you know,
[1:37:48] we got home and
[1:37:51] another thing that I'd been struggling
[1:37:52] with is here and there that
[1:37:55] under a oppression of bad attitude and
[1:38:00] grumpy, mad, say things that I'm ashamed
[1:38:03] of. Uh, and I despise personally,
[1:38:07] despise strongly and yet get under that.
[1:38:11] Well, we get home and I'm grumbling. I'm
[1:38:14] like, man, I didn't was just just bad
[1:38:18] day.
[1:38:19] And I I was thinking I was like, man, I
[1:38:22] hope somebody got something today cuz
[1:38:25] and I was talking out loud. I was like,
[1:38:27] cuz I sure didn't get anything. And I
[1:38:29] corrected myself. I thought, no. I said,
[1:38:31] "No, actually, I did. I don't feel like
[1:38:33] I did, but I got I got what I needed."
[1:38:37] And sure enough, the next morning, and I
[1:38:40] kind of felt bad. I was like, I don't
[1:38:43] want to speak anything negative like,
[1:38:46] oh, I didn't get what I I just claimed I
[1:38:48] did.
[1:38:50] Well, the next morning, oh my goodness,
[1:38:52] I got up and another thing I've been
[1:38:55] struggling with was pain in my shoulders
[1:38:57] and discomfort and just headaches. I
[1:38:59] woke up and that pain, I slept wrong. I
[1:39:02] don't know what happened. Oh no, that
[1:39:04] just that fear, that depression, it just
[1:39:07] was hanging over me. That's probably the
[1:39:09] worst one of the worst I've ever had.
[1:39:12] And I was I left the house. I told
[1:39:15] Meredith to pray for me. I was going to
[1:39:16] Braze Island and it was like I should
[1:39:20] hurry up, turn around and head back to
[1:39:21] town and get somebody to pray for me or
[1:39:23] something. It was just terrible. And I
[1:39:27] WhatsApp brother Jason. I And I'm
[1:39:28] thankful that he was right there to
[1:39:30] answer. And I even called and he
[1:39:32] answered right away. and he just given
[1:39:36] me
[1:39:39] helped me and positive and
[1:39:42] helped me to get leveled out and
[1:39:48] got my I got to my job. I'm sorry this
[1:39:50] is really long. I got to my job and uh I
[1:39:55] just pushing through it. Okay, whatever.
[1:39:58] However, I feel I'm pushing through
[1:40:00] this. This I don't believe this. I'm not
[1:40:02] try settling for this. I'm healed. I'm
[1:40:05] I'm delivered.
[1:40:07] And I went to my first job. It was, you
[1:40:10] know, was a little bit better, just
[1:40:13] trembly and just fury. And got to my
[1:40:16] second one. And the Lord kind of, I
[1:40:19] believe the Lord kind of started talking
[1:40:20] to me. It's like,
[1:40:24] you know, that that that anger thing. It
[1:40:27] kind of it kind of got tripped up in
[1:40:29] that fear thing, didn't it?
[1:40:31] and that and that and that problem in my
[1:40:34] shoulders. It kind of tripped up and all
[1:40:36] it's all working together, wasn't it? I
[1:40:38] thought, "Oh my, God set a trap and I
[1:40:41] didn't know it." And I believe that God
[1:40:44] used that and I'm claiming now, devil,
[1:40:49] you're stupid.
[1:40:51] And God, thank God, I'm claiming
[1:40:53] deliverance from all three of them
[1:40:55] things. And I told Brother Jason, and I
[1:40:57] don't know, find out. We'll find out
[1:40:58] what else got in there because I'm free
[1:41:00] of all of it. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:02] Hallelujah.
[1:41:08] Hallelujah.
[1:41:12] Um so, uh for those of the brothers who
[1:41:15] were at the Thursday night prayer
[1:41:16] meeting, um y'all remember I had asked
[1:41:19] for prayer for sister Emily's family
[1:41:21] because her brother had passed away on
[1:41:24] Thursday. And um specifically would ask
[1:41:27] that um the Lord would use the situation
[1:41:30] to really move on the family because a
[1:41:33] lot of them weren't serving the Lord or
[1:41:34] anything. It would be an opportunity and
[1:41:37] um his son gave his heart to the Lord at
[1:41:39] the funeral on Sunday.
[1:41:41] Wow. and um as of this morning um he
[1:41:44] felt convicted um with his situation and
[1:41:50] um was just really cleaning a lot of
[1:41:52] stuff up and you know it was just it's a
[1:41:55] real miracle and I just wanted to
[1:41:57] testify that uh if anyone was still of
[1:41:59] any doubt Thursday night prayer meeting
[1:42:01] works really well.
[1:42:03] Hallelujah.
[1:42:06] Amen. Praise the Lord. Right. Right
[1:42:08] behind you Martha. Martha hand it to
[1:42:10] Martha. There you go.
[1:42:12] Um, a while back y'all prayed for Uriah.
[1:42:16] Um, he had a a test he had to take and
[1:42:19] he needed a certain score in order to
[1:42:22] qualify for some scholarships and he was
[1:42:24] convinced. He'd already taken the test
[1:42:26] twice. Um, this was his last opportunity
[1:42:28] to take it and pass. And um, he was
[1:42:31] convinced that there's no way like he
[1:42:33] can't study anymore and blah blah blah.
[1:42:36] Anyway, so we prayed and when we got the
[1:42:40] the score, he was he missed it by 10
[1:42:44] points, but the way that they score it
[1:42:46] is they take all of your highest scores
[1:42:48] from your previous test and they combine
[1:42:50] it. And so he had 10 extra points on
[1:42:53] another test. So he got the exact number
[1:42:56] that he needed. Um and you know those
[1:43:00] things are that scholarship or that test
[1:43:03] score was will allow him to get the
[1:43:05] highest scholarship that he can get
[1:43:06] through the federal
[1:43:08] um loan or federal scholarships. But um
[1:43:12] it also qualifies him for all these
[1:43:13] other scholarships that um it opens up a
[1:43:16] lot of doors. But you know in the grand
[1:43:18] scheme of things those are really small
[1:43:20] things. Um but I just I'm praying that
[1:43:24] God will use it for his um for a
[1:43:28] testimony to him.
[1:43:29] Yeah.
[1:43:29] And um
[1:43:33] it's hard because he's moving away
[1:43:35] probably and all of these things. So
[1:43:37] it's scary and you know I just want God
[1:43:39] to really move in his life. And um he's
[1:43:43] if y'all keep him in prayer, he's got
[1:43:45] one more um scholarship that he is
[1:43:48] trying to get. They're going to have to
[1:43:49] make they're fighting for him. they want
[1:43:51] him to get it, but it's it's one of
[1:43:53] those things where they have to make an
[1:43:54] exception. Um, because of where it's a
[1:43:57] county based scholarship. Um, but
[1:43:59] because he lives in the right county,
[1:44:01] but he goes to school in a different
[1:44:04] county, it's one of those things where
[1:44:06] it's, you know, a gray area. Um, but
[1:44:08] just pray that, you know, if it's God's
[1:44:10] will, he'll get that one as well. So,
[1:44:12] we're supposed to know something in a
[1:44:14] few days.
[1:44:21] give you the last word, brother Bradley.
[1:44:22] All right.
[1:44:24] 10 seconds. I read the act scriptures
[1:44:26] that you preached on James 1 to the
[1:44:29] finish. And I looked over my wife and I
[1:44:31] said, "That's the scripture I read this
[1:44:32] morning.
[1:44:37] Praise the Lord."
[1:44:40] What is it? Oh, you had a testimony.
[1:44:44] Uh oh my goodness. Yeah, that's right.
[1:44:46] I'm the one who told you to give it.
[1:44:47] Yeah.
[1:44:49] Amen. So, uh, it was what, three weeks
[1:44:51] ago. I gave the first half of the
[1:44:53] testimony
[1:44:54] as I'd sold my vehicle. And
[1:44:57] three weeks and I was, man, I was about
[1:44:59] to go look at a Nissan. That's how
[1:45:02] that's how desperate I was getting. And
[1:45:04] uh, so I saw this uh, my wife actually
[1:45:08] sent me this um, Expedition up in Myrtle
[1:45:10] Beach. And I was like, man, I don't want
[1:45:11] to drive four and a half hours, but it's
[1:45:12] everything I want. like literally
[1:45:14] everything I would have done to it to
[1:45:16] make it what I would want it was already
[1:45:18] done and the price was pretty close to
[1:45:21] what um how much money I had to pay for
[1:45:24] it. So I figured I could probably talk
[1:45:25] him down and so I made the I contacted
[1:45:29] him. He didn't get back to me until like
[1:45:31] the next day and he's like well I can't
[1:45:32] meet till like 4 on Saturday. I was like
[1:45:34] well I can't do that. I'll be like
[1:45:36] midnight at that at that rate. So I was
[1:45:38] like well so I asked him a couple other
[1:45:40] questions tried this up another time.
[1:45:42] Didn't answer. Didn't answer. So, I was
[1:45:43] like, I don't know what to do. So, I
[1:45:46] waited. And then Monday, I was like,
[1:45:48] "Well, I'm just going to message him
[1:45:50] again and see if he'll get back with
[1:45:52] me." I messaged him Monday night. I was
[1:45:54] like, "Hey, you got time this week
[1:45:56] sometime I can come up and check this
[1:45:58] out." And he's like, "Yeah, I'm off
[1:46:00] tomorrow. Come up anytime." So, uh, my
[1:46:02] brother and I drove up, um, Tuesday and
[1:46:05] ended up buying it, um, for $200 more
[1:46:10] than what I sold my old one for that had
[1:46:13] was it had a whole lot more miles on it
[1:46:15] and was just a base model. And now I got
[1:46:17] one that's like fully trimmed out with
[1:46:19] all kinds of extras for for 200 bucks
[1:46:22] more.
[1:46:23] Yeah. So, which according to the state
[1:46:25] of Georgia is worth 10 grand and I did
[1:46:27] not pay that, but they made me pay taxes
[1:46:28] on 10 grand.
[1:46:36] That's Georgia for you. Turn around and
[1:46:39] shake hands with somebody. Say, "God
[1:46:40] bless you, friend."
[1:46:43] Brothers, we'll see you tomorrow night
[1:46:44] at the uh men's prayer meeting. You can
[1:46:46] be dismissed in Jesus name. God bless
[1:46:48] you.
