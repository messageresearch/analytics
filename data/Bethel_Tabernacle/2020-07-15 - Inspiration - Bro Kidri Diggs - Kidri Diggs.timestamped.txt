[35:14] second chronicles 36
[35:20] and i want to um i'm going to read it
[35:23] i'll start reading that verse 22.
[35:31] ii chronicles 36
[35:34] verse 22.
[35:38] now the bible says now
[35:41] in the first year of cyrus king of
[35:44] persia
[35:45] that the word of the lord spoken by the
[35:48] mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished
[35:50] the lord stirred up the spirit
[35:52] of cyrus king of persia that
[35:55] he made a proclamation throughout all
[35:58] the kingdom
[35:59] and put it into writing thus
[36:03] saith cyrus king of persia
[36:06] all the kingdoms of the earth hath the
[36:09] lord god of heaven given me
[36:11] and he hath charged me to build him a
[36:14] house in jerusalem which is
[36:18] in judah who is there among you
[36:21] of all his people the lord his god
[36:26] be with him and let him go up
[36:30] amen job 32.
[36:42] job chapter 32
[36:48] and verse 8
[36:51] job 32 verse 8.
[36:55] the bible says but there is a spirit
[36:58] in man and the inspiration of the
[37:01] almighty
[37:02] giveth them understanding
[37:05] amen may the lord bless you reading of
[37:07] his word you can have your seats
[37:13] amen tonight by the grace of god i want
[37:16] to
[37:17] use for a subject inspiration
[37:20] you know and and and i almost want to
[37:23] put it in the
[37:24] format of a verb catch the inspiration
[37:28] or see the inspiration you know but
[37:32] first of all let's just define
[37:34] inspiration you know and
[37:36] what it means to be inspired you know
[37:39] um throughout the throughout the world
[37:42] throughout the bible
[37:44] men have always been inspired
[37:47] but i want you to understand one thing
[37:49] about inspiration
[37:51] there's two kinds of inspiration there's
[37:54] a good inspiration
[37:56] and there's a bad inspiration now you
[37:58] can be inspired but what are you being
[38:00] inspired by
[38:02] you know and as we look in the scripture
[38:05] you know we could see that the king
[38:07] cyrus of persia he was being inspired
[38:10] but where was that inspiration coming
[38:12] from you know as
[38:14] as we look let's just let's just look at
[38:16] what it means to be inspired the
[38:18] definition of inspired is
[38:20] to fill with an animating quickening
[38:23] or exalting influence see let's just
[38:27] take the word animating
[38:29] if you use the word animating that means
[38:31] it's not usual
[38:33] that means it's a little different
[38:34] hallelujah animating means it's not the
[38:37] normal hallelujah
[38:39] so inspiration a lot of times is not
[38:42] what would normally happen
[38:44] hallelujah so when we take the
[38:46] inspiration of god
[38:48] is not something that happens on a
[38:50] day-to-day basis
[38:52] but it's something that in that moment
[38:54] god is
[38:55] inspiring in that believer's life
[38:57] hallelujah
[38:58] but what i want you to catch is it's a
[39:01] quickening hallelujah it's something
[39:03] that you cannot
[39:05] steal from that individual hell yeah
[39:08] it's something that has been made alive
[39:10] so i'm saying tonight if god ever
[39:13] inspires you
[39:15] to do something it don't matter what the
[39:17] people in the church say
[39:19] hallelujah you can say god told me to do
[39:22] it hallelujah
[39:23] god quickness god made this live in me
[39:26] hallelujah in the next part it says or
[39:30] exalting influence hallelujah to be
[39:33] inspired it's an exalting influence
[39:37] that means no matter what's going on in
[39:39] your life
[39:40] this inspiration has the power to
[39:43] control

[40:16] understanding hallelujah this
[40:18] inspiration
[40:19] hallelujah it comes upon you and you may
[40:22] not even understand
[40:24] what you're being inspired by amen
[40:28] hallelujah abraham was inspired
[40:32] and didn't even understand it
[40:36] hallelujah god told me you could have a
[40:39] son
[40:40] you have a son and and and and you and
[40:43] sarah and i know y'all oh
[40:44] but hallelujah listen this is what i'm
[40:47] saying
[40:48] church hallelujah to be inspired what is
[40:51] it
[40:52] it's just like king cyrus the bible says
[40:55] right here
[40:56] with king cyrus look what god did in
[40:59] in this verse right here it says
[41:03] it says now in the first year of cyrus
[41:07] king of persia
[41:08] the word of the lord spoken by the mouth
[41:10] of jeremiah
[41:12] might be accomplished what did god do
[41:14] that the word might be accomplished
[41:16] the bible says he stirred up cyrus
[41:20] spirit
[41:24] when god wants things to take place he
[41:27] stirs us up
[41:28] hallelujah think about that church amen
[41:31] it's not
[41:31] us doing things on our own but it's god
[41:34] stirring us up hallelujah it's god
[41:37] stirring up the pot
[41:38] but you know what a lot of times the
[41:40] only way we can tap into the inspiration
[41:43] is to have trouble in our lives
[41:49] trouble hallelujah brings forth a
[41:52] powerful inspiration
[41:53] hallelujah but you look right here um
[41:57] when you think about god stirring up
[41:59] king cyrus
[42:00] and cyrus he didn't even know what was
[42:03] going on why did he want to
[42:04] do this for the people why did he want
[42:06] to set the people free
[42:08] why did he want to do this particular
[42:09] thing in the kingdom as the king
[42:11] it was god stirring up the spirit to
[42:14] fulfill
[42:15] the word that was spoken already by
[42:17] jeremiah hallelujah
[42:19] so church what i'm saying right now holy
[42:21] god is sending forth or sent forth
[42:24] an inspiration to stir up this church
[42:27] that we may fulfill
[42:29] what brother branham has already
[42:30] preached
[42:34] we're not being inspired hallelujah
[42:36] bye-bye
[42:37] by by just a man from kentucky we're not
[42:39] being inspired by
[42:40] how he dress or how good he talks we're
[42:43] being inspired
[42:44] by the word that was spoken hallelujah
[42:48] it's a quickening it's an exalting
[42:50] influence hallelujah
[42:54] and throughout time men were always
[42:57] stirred up hallelujah men were always
[43:00] inspired
[43:01] and we know our prophet was a man of
[43:02] history
[43:05] and you know when you go back and you
[43:06] look let's look at some men that were
[43:09] inspired before we go back to abraham
[43:11] you know before
[43:13] the inspiration got to us in our day
[43:16] other men had to be inspired
[43:20] holly luther was inspired
[43:25] but what made that inspiration come
[43:28] it was the trouble he saw in the
[43:32] catholic church
[43:34] it was all the things that he saw were
[43:36] going wrong harley
[43:37] and something began to stir up his
[43:40] spirit what was it
[43:41] it was god hallelujah
[43:45] who's the one just saying i'm sick of
[43:46] going to church i'm sick of some sick
[43:48] no god began to stir up his spirit why
[43:52] because he had a word that only luther
[43:55] could bring forth in that day
[43:56] and it was the just shall live by faith
[44:00] so god began to stir up his spirit so he
[44:03] could catch the inspiration
[44:04] why because there were people on the
[44:06] earth at the same time
[44:08] that would catch the same inspiration
[44:12] hallelujah so his thought wasn't just
[44:15] for him
[44:16] here there were a lot of other seas
[44:18] laying dormant in the catholic church
[44:22] hallelujah right there where some were
[44:25] catching
[44:26] the inspiration to be a catholic that
[44:28] would others catch the inspiration
[44:30] to be a lutheran
[44:33] so right under the same umbrella you had
[44:36] some being inspired by god
[44:38] and you had some being inspired by the
[44:39] antichrist
[44:41] [Music]
[44:44] and by god's grace we're gonna show you
[44:46] we're still in that same mode
[44:50] you look luther was inspired
[44:54] but he was the inspiration on luther
[44:58] had limits wow
[45:01] hallelujah this is the inspiration he
[45:04] caught
[45:05] he had limits on it he can be inspired
[45:08] to live by faith
[45:09] but still smoke a pipe
[45:14] he could be inspired by faith but still
[45:16] have a dirty life
[45:18] hallelujah not saying that the
[45:20] inspiration wasn't right
[45:22] but his inspiration had limits on it
[45:25] churchill there were a lot of great men
[45:28] of the world who was inspired one guy i
[45:32] love to talk about
[45:33] he's known all the way throughout
[45:34] history he's known from ages to ages and
[45:37] generations to generations
[45:39] and as long as we have a world his name
[45:42] will be mentioned
[45:45] and it's called his name is adolf hitler
[45:52] do you understand hitler was inspired
[45:57] he didn't just one day say i hate jews
[46:00] no
[46:00] he caught an inspiration but church i
[46:03] want you to understand something holly
[46:05] it may have looked like that hitler was
[46:08] a wicked man
[46:09] but what was he catching he was catching
[46:11] the inspiration
[46:12] that the jews had to go back home on
[46:14] eagle's wings
[46:18] so you're either going to fulfill the
[46:20] good by inspiration
[46:22] or the bad by inspiration just so it was
[46:26] hitler's lot
[46:27] to fulfill the bad but he was definitely
[46:31] inspired
[46:33] and he thought that the germans or
[46:36] or or caucasian race was superior to any
[46:40] other race that was the wrong
[46:43] inspiration
[46:46] because when god created man he created
[46:48] and created all of us
[46:49] equal so what god did
[46:52] to show hitler that he caught the wrong
[46:55] inspiration
[46:56] hallelujah they got inspired hallelujah
[46:58] to have the olympics in germany
[47:02] how many know your history
[47:05] they got inspired to have the olympics
[47:07] in germany
[47:08] because hitler wanted to show how great
[47:11] his inspiration was
[47:15] he wanted to show that his race was a
[47:17] superior race
[47:18] you know what was you know what was
[47:20] stirring hitler up harley
[47:22] his father the devil had the same
[47:24] inspiration
[47:28] amen where he he put all his eggs in a
[47:32] basket
[47:32] built on race and that's what the devil
[47:35] did
[47:36] hallelujah he put it all on race
[47:39] he looked up in heaven and he saw a
[47:41] superior race
[47:45] but what he did he put it on skin color
[47:49] when the superiority wasn't in skin
[47:51] color
[47:52] it was in the seed holy that's how he
[47:55] caught the wrong inspiration
[47:58] just like his father the devil got the
[48:01] wrong inspiration
[48:06] you know what he said he said how you
[48:07] know what i'm gonna get into this race
[48:09] and my seed hallelujah gonna mingle with
[48:12] with the woman's seat and so forth
[48:13] y'all know the story holly but he was
[48:15] catching the wrong inspiration
[48:17] to be like god holly has nothing to do
[48:19] with your flesh
[48:22] god's superior race is in your spirit
[48:25] hallelujah
[48:26] it's in your soul hallelujah it's in
[48:28] your seed hallelujah
[48:30] the right inspiration hallelujah you
[48:33] can't see from the
[48:34] outside amen
[48:38] so when you go back in history you can
[48:40] see they built this big old nice stadium
[48:42] in germany and hit the hallelujah you
[48:45] know he had to not sit marching
[48:46] all that stuff and we're superior we're
[48:49] superior and you know what
[48:50] there was a man hallelujah who was very
[48:53] insignificant hallelujah
[48:55] there was a man it just so happened if
[48:57] y'all don't mind me saying
[48:58] it was a black man
[49:03] and this black man was going to prove to
[49:06] hitler that you got the wrong
[49:08] inspiration
[49:09] that your race is not superior
[49:11] hallelujah it's not her
[49:13] the size of the dog in the fight hurry
[49:16] up
[49:16] it's the size of the fight in the dog
[49:22] and even though hallelujah jesse owens
[49:25] [Music]
[49:27] even though jesse came from hallelujah
[49:29] province conditions and
[49:31] slavery conditions and all these things
[49:33] he had the heart of a lion
[49:36] amen and there was something that
[49:38] stirred him
[49:39] up to be the best that he could be so
[49:42] you know what church
[49:43] when it came time to run jesse trained
[49:45] and trained
[49:46] why did he train so hard he was catching
[49:48] the inspiration
[49:52] wow he was catching the inspiration
[49:55] earlier to prove hitler wrong
[49:59] amen so
[50:02] look at it if hitler was inspired by the
[50:06] devil
[50:07] who was jesse inspired by
[50:13] [Music]
[50:14] hold my church so you know what he
[50:16] trained and he trained and he trained
[50:18] real hard
[50:19] now let's fast forward now they're at
[50:21] the olympics hallelujah
[50:23] and they begin to run the race
[50:24] hallelujah and hitler put his best man
[50:27] out there
[50:27] hallelujah and he was out there running
[50:29] against jesse and you know what has
[50:31] happened jesse smoked him
[50:35] amen
[50:39] oh i know sometimes we we get a little
[50:41] too young
[50:43] jesse won the race
[50:49] hallelujah every other person the best
[50:52] of the best
[50:54] they got smoked by jesse hallelujah
[50:57] and you know what hitler all he could do
[50:58] was sit up there and take it
[51:00] so he put out the next man hallelujah
[51:02] see you can't stop the inspiration of
[51:04] god
[51:05] once it gets to rolling it's like a
[51:08] runaway train
[51:10] it won't stop until it's finished until
[51:13] it meets its destination
[51:15] so you know what happened to jesse did
[51:17] this just win one time
[51:19] it was two times it was three times all
[51:21] the way to
[51:22] six gold medals
[51:27] what a way to shut down
[51:30] the wrong inspiration
[51:35] till it was so hot see when god ever
[51:37] inspires you
[51:38] holy it makes the devil look silly
[51:42] holy teal church jesse won
[51:45] six gold medals i believe it was six six
[51:47] gold medals and after he won
[51:49] hitler was so mad he didn't even shake
[51:51] his hand
[51:54] but that didn't change the fact that
[51:57] jesse won the race
[52:00] church it doesn't matter what the devil
[52:01] is doing in our day
[52:03] no the message is not a mess
[52:08] it's still truth hallelujah it's still
[52:11] scent of god hallelujah
[52:12] it's still vindicated amen and no matter
[52:15] what the devil is saying
[52:17] we're here and inspired by god to make
[52:20] it
[52:20] live again
[52:23] hallelujah but he looked at inspiration
[52:27] and he got the wrong inspiration but
[52:29] there were men
[52:30] on the earth who caught inspiration and
[52:33] it tied right into what god was doing
[52:36] hallelujah you know there was a man
[52:39] hurley who got tired of riding just the
[52:41] horse alone
[52:42] he put it on a buggy said i don't just
[52:46] want to ride by myself
[52:47] but i want to take somebody where i'm
[52:49] going hallelujah
[52:50] so he took the horse and put it to the
[52:52] carriage he was inspired to do that
[52:56] and then there was somebody else who
[52:58] caught his inspiration
[53:00] hurry up but it had a greater value to
[53:03] it hardly
[53:04] why the person that created the horse
[53:06] and buggy he was limit just to that
[53:08] earlier
[53:09] so the next man came along which i
[53:11] believe was henry ford
[53:12] hallelujah and caught the inspiration of
[53:15] the automobile hallelujah
[53:16] a little bit more horsepower but he's
[53:19] still riding on the same inspiration
[53:21] he just got a greater height hallelujah
[53:24] and then there's somebody who came along
[53:26] hey man two brothers called the wright
[53:28] brothers
[53:29] who said you know what the inspiration
[53:31] to drive is all right
[53:33] but i want to get there a little bit
[53:34] faster
[53:37] do you see now i'm gonna say something
[53:39] that's gonna shake your boots say man
[53:40] church we should be listen to me good
[53:43] now
[53:44] we should be inspired hollywood if not
[53:47] on the same level
[53:48] but a little bit greater than the
[53:50] prophet was
[54:01] and he's in the scriptures you ain't in
[54:03] the scripture
[54:06] hallelujah remember he finished his
[54:10] scripture first
[54:11] then we take over hallelujah
[54:14] so church if there's a glory that excels
[54:18] that other glory hallelujah what should
[54:20] we be hallelujah
[54:22] if the glory of moses hallelujah was
[54:25] close was glorious
[54:26] hallelujah what about when we understand
[54:29] that it's god behind that veil
[54:33] amen
[54:36] remember when you catch the right
[54:37] inspiration you
[54:39] know it was god using brother branham
[54:41] and you won't worship the man
[54:45] that's when you catch the right
[54:46] inspiration
[54:49] amen he said as long as the people
[54:53] couldn't go past moses he stayed veiled
[54:56] but when they saw the lord the veil was
[54:58] lifted
[55:00] in church that's where we are hallelujah
[55:02] the veil
[55:04] should be lifted when you read this
[55:06] message you see christ
[55:08] when you read this bible you should see
[55:10] christ when you look in the mirror you
[55:13] should see christ
[55:14] when you see your pastor you should see
[55:16] christ when you come to church
[55:18] you should see christ when you sing
[55:20] songs you should hear
[55:21] christ
[55:26] look look the trouble brought forth more
[55:29] inspiration the need brought forth
[55:33] more inspiration listen hallelujah
[55:36] let me let me read something to you
[55:40] oh my oh my oh my listen
[55:43] inspiration to fill with an animating
[55:46] quickening or exalting influence
[55:48] to produce or arouse hallelujah
[55:52] see church when inspiration comes it's
[55:55] supposed to produce something
[55:58] or it's supposed to arouse something
[56:02] but if it's producing or if it's
[56:04] arousing
[56:05] what is it producing and what is it
[56:07] arousing amen
[56:11] if it's god inspiring it has to be god
[56:14] arousing god or inspiring god
[56:18] hallelujah because god can only connect
[56:21] with himself
[56:22] [Music]
[56:28] listen church listen what he says he
[56:31] says
[56:32] now look the word has to be inspired
[56:37] hearing it recognizing it and acting
[56:39] upon it
[56:40] many people will hear it but won't
[56:42] recognize it
[56:44] in church look for us to to live this
[56:48] message
[56:48] we had to hear it and recognize it
[56:53] that's the problem with people leaving
[56:55] the truth
[56:56] they can't see themselves in the word
[57:00] they don't recognize that the revelation
[57:02] of this message
[57:03] is speaking with you and your
[57:05] relationship with christ
[57:08] you have to see yourself as a part of
[57:11] the word
[57:12] hallelujah look church the uh the
[57:15] prophet of god when he began to talk
[57:16] about
[57:17] moses at the burning bush he said he
[57:20] said
[57:20] what was it he said moses heard his name
[57:23] but then god began to talk to
[57:25] he said it was the word seeing the word
[57:30] amen amen so it's more than just god
[57:34] sent the prophet
[57:36] it's the word seeing the word
[57:42] remember the bible says in the beginning
[57:44] was the word
[57:45] the word was with god hallelujah and you
[57:48] know you drop down to the 12th verse
[57:49] it says and the word became flesh
[57:53] so all the things that we know god is
[57:55] became flesh
[57:57] holy so we should be catching the same
[58:00] inspiration of god
[58:02] holy if you are inspired you're inspired
[58:05] hallelujah
[58:06] as a human no
[58:11] you're not inspired as a human right no
[58:13] we're inspired to be children of god
[58:17] we don't want some earthly inspiration
[58:20] that will perish
[58:22] but we want hallelujah divinely exalting
[58:25] influence
[58:29] most of the people in the scripture when
[58:31] they cut and don't get nervous on about
[58:33] the clothes
[58:34] most of the people in the scripture when
[58:36] they caught the inspiration
[58:37] it was something that wasn't even
[58:39] written
[58:41] it was something that never happened
[58:43] before
[58:45] now let me ask you a question does god
[58:47] change does this inspiration change
[58:50] so you know what church i'm not looking
[58:52] to create squirrels i got my own
[58:54] inspiration
[58:57] i got my own need hallelujah and besides
[59:00] i'm not a hunter so that'll never happen
[59:05] hallelujah i got no need of squirrels
[59:07] hallelujah
[59:08] glory but you look church most of the
[59:11] men and women of god
[59:13] when they were inspired hallelujah they
[59:15] were inspired
[59:17] to bring forth something that did never
[59:20] exist
[59:22] amen oh my church
[59:25] let's go back to abraham remember god
[59:28] told abraham you're going to be the
[59:30] father of faith
[59:32] but for abraham to get that out he had
[59:34] to be inspired
[59:36] but i want you to understand sarah
[59:39] caught inspiration
[59:41] but she caught the wrong inspiration
[59:45] she said yeah we heard what the lord
[59:47] said but i'm going to help it go forth
[59:50] see inspiration is not premeditated
[59:55] inspiration is not you looking in the
[59:57] mirror saying you know what if this
[59:58] happens
[59:59] i'm going to speak the word
[1:00:03] that's good you might be thinking like
[1:00:04] that hallelujah but then that might be
[1:00:06] you
[1:00:06] hallelujah that might not be god
[1:00:10] real inspiration it's a stirring
[1:00:14] it's an arisa is god
[1:00:17] coming on the scene it's people and i'm
[1:00:20] gonna say this
[1:00:21] is people when that inspiration strikes
[1:00:24] you
[1:00:24] to fulfill that part of god in your life
[1:00:27] is people
[1:00:28] looking at you like you crazy
[1:00:35] think about it once abraham caught the
[1:00:38] inspiration
[1:00:39] he was looking for isaac and he was 90
[1:00:42] something years old
[1:00:44] and you know everybody probably was
[1:00:45] looking at him and sarah like they're
[1:00:47] crazy
[1:00:47] but they caught the inspiration
[1:00:51] you know before before that sarah she
[1:00:53] says okay
[1:00:54] i'm gonna help god hey god this is what
[1:00:56] i want you to do i want you
[1:00:58] to take my husband and y'all have a baby
[1:01:00] and we'll catch the inspiration
[1:01:02] that was the wrong inspiration because
[1:01:05] it produced the wrong thing hallelujah
[1:01:07] how do you know when it's god when it
[1:01:10] comes forth you see god in it
[1:01:12] amen you know a lot of times people want
[1:01:14] to do things they say
[1:01:15] but god led me god led me and you you
[1:01:17] don't see any fruits of god
[1:01:20] he's like a man who says god is leading
[1:01:22] me just leading me to start a church
[1:01:24] and he starts a church hallelujah and
[1:01:26] the church goes on for 15 years
[1:01:29] and it's just him and his family
[1:01:41] it's hard for me and this is brother
[1:01:43] diggs
[1:01:44] it's hard for me to say that god
[1:01:47] inspired him to do that with no fruit
[1:01:54] because if god is inspiring you to do
[1:01:57] something
[1:01:58] there will be fruits of god's life
[1:02:00] coming out of it
[1:02:02] amen oh you say well you know
[1:02:05] i think i'm going to buy me a brand new
[1:02:07] car holly brother matt
[1:02:09] i'm going to get that maserati
[1:02:10] hallelujah
[1:02:12] and i drive up to charlotte i get the
[1:02:14] maserati and about a month later
[1:02:16] sister watkins i say man these payments
[1:02:18] killing me
[1:02:21] i wasn't inspired by god if that's the
[1:02:25] outcome
[1:02:26] if you get something and you're not
[1:02:27] happy with it don't blame that on god
[1:02:31] that's your fault hallelujah you caught
[1:02:33] the wrong inspiration you probably
[1:02:35] shoulda got a honda
[1:02:41] hallelujah but if you're inspired we're
[1:02:44] gonna take it up another notch
[1:02:46] if you're and god tells you to go get it
[1:02:49] it can be an r
[1:02:50] r hallelujah it can be a rolls royce say
[1:02:53] man
[1:02:54] but if god has inspired you to get it it
[1:02:56] don't matter how much it costs
[1:03:00] you'll be happy driving at the church
[1:03:01] holiday
[1:03:03] glory people be looking at you they'll
[1:03:05] say oh he don't need that he just showed
[1:03:07] up you say hey i was inspired
[1:03:11] all is well god is good
[1:03:14] but when you when we go out and do
[1:03:16] things and then we
[1:03:17] reap the repercussions of it you caught
[1:03:20] the wrong inspiration
[1:03:23] amen listen
[1:03:28] um
[1:03:32] this is the part i like
[1:03:35] when you look at abraham
[1:03:38] abraham was he got to a place
[1:03:42] to where his troubles begin to inspire
[1:03:46] him to look for answers from god
[1:03:49] can i get amen has anybody walk down
[1:03:52] that road
[1:03:54] now this is gonna shock you but i'm
[1:03:56] gonna say something that we don't like
[1:03:57] to hear
[1:03:58] troubles are a blessing
[1:04:03] hallelujah troubles
[1:04:06] are a blessing because no matter what's
[1:04:09] happening
[1:04:10] the scripture says it works out for your
[1:04:13] good
[1:04:14] so no matter what you're going through
[1:04:16] no matter what the situation
[1:04:17] if you are a believer you have a promise
[1:04:20] that is working out
[1:04:22] for your good you might not see it in
[1:04:25] the moment
[1:04:26] hallelujah but if you stay true to
[1:04:29] god it will work out for your goodness
[1:04:36] i wrecked my car it will work out for
[1:04:39] your good
[1:04:41] all right oh bro diggs
[1:04:45] cover 19 made me lose my job it will
[1:04:48] work
[1:04:49] out for your good amen
[1:04:53] are we believers or not
[1:04:59] are we believers or not see church i'm
[1:05:01] finding out
[1:05:02] that some people are just church goals
[1:05:08] who are you behind the mask
[1:05:13] hey man we all look alike with a mask on
[1:05:16] but who are you
[1:05:17] behind the mask are you really
[1:05:20] hallelujah a child of god
[1:05:24] or are you hiding behind the mask
[1:05:31] are you luke skywalker or are you darth
[1:05:34] vader
[1:05:43] god uses trouble to inspire
[1:05:47] us to catch what he has for us in that
[1:05:50] moment
[1:05:52] so that's why my subtitle is catch the
[1:05:54] inspiration
[1:05:56] because when you look in the bible most
[1:05:58] of the time when
[1:05:59] people says of god got in trouble
[1:06:02] god was trying to inspire them to go to
[1:06:05] a higher level
[1:06:08] church look at moses trouble he's he's
[1:06:10] he didn't brought the people
[1:06:11] out the whole time he had the people
[1:06:13] they were complaining trouble trouble
[1:06:15] trouble
[1:06:16] complaining complaining preachers rising
[1:06:18] up in the church
[1:06:19] causing confusion trouble trouble
[1:06:21] trouble his sister and his brother
[1:06:23] mad at who he married trouble trouble
[1:06:25] trouble
[1:06:27] the whole journey was trouble how could
[1:06:30] he be inspired
[1:06:31] god put him in a place where he hardly
[1:06:34] couldn't control god put him in a
[1:06:37] situation
[1:06:38] where all he could do was talk back to
[1:06:40] god
[1:06:44] and sometimes god put us in a place
[1:06:46] where all we can do is talk back to him
[1:06:50] amen your pastor can help the ministry
[1:06:52] can't help
[1:06:53] your parents can't help your wife your
[1:06:55] husband can't help your children can
[1:06:56] help
[1:06:57] all you can do is talk to god
[1:07:05] either it's either it's trouble or it's
[1:07:08] death
[1:07:09] but the prophet of god said hallelujah
[1:07:12] god puts a
[1:07:13] bit in his mouth and rides it into the
[1:07:16] presence of god
[1:07:22] think about that your troubles are
[1:07:24] carrying you into the presence of god
[1:07:28] come on somebody god is doing something
[1:07:31] in our lives
[1:07:32] and i'm gonna say it again i said it a
[1:07:35] couple months ago
[1:07:36] but thank god for the blessings of kovis
[1:07:40] 19.
[1:07:45] because this virus is showing
[1:07:48] who we really are
[1:07:52] do you believe in isaiah 53 or not
[1:07:56] do you believe that god is a provider or
[1:07:58] not
[1:07:59] do you believe that he's a deliverer or
[1:08:01] not
[1:08:03] and as we see the lord approaching do
[1:08:06] you want to fellowship the more
[1:08:08] or not
[1:08:14] because streaming is available that
[1:08:16] doesn't mean god wants to stay away from
[1:08:18] each other
[1:08:26] i don't know about y'all but i love
[1:08:28] driving these two hours
[1:08:31] i shouldn't say that i had to use a
[1:08:32] mountain dew to get down here
[1:08:37] but i love coming to be with the saints
[1:08:40] i love seeing brother jason and shaking
[1:08:41] his hand and brother matt and the
[1:08:42] different
[1:08:43] sisters and brothers i love seeing y'all
[1:08:46] amen
[1:08:46] and it does mean much more justice
[1:08:49] seeing you in person than looking at you
[1:08:51] on a stream from my house
[1:08:55] why hallelujah because i don't have a
[1:08:58] scripture
[1:08:58] for online preaching
[1:09:04] so i don't get no inspiration from that
[1:09:08] but i do have a scripture that say we
[1:09:09] ought to fellowship the more
[1:09:12] as we see the day approaching
[1:09:15] so think about the church the more we
[1:09:17] gather even like this
[1:09:19] holy in the climate of cobalt 19
[1:09:21] inspiration is still here
[1:09:24] god is still among us hallelujah the
[1:09:27] virus didn't push god out
[1:09:29] but the virus brought god closer
[1:09:33] he's here church
[1:09:36] hallelujah what else covey did
[1:09:39] covet has increased our prayer life
[1:09:45] since watkins i almost gave you a high
[1:09:47] five just now
[1:09:51] and you know that would have been god
[1:09:52] moving if she would have got up and gave
[1:09:53] me one
[1:09:56] i know she got it in her spirit holiday
[1:09:59] once she get home she probably gonna
[1:10:00] give it to brother jason
[1:10:03] that's all right sister i take that
[1:10:07] my church look at covet covet hallelujah
[1:10:10] holly could it be god stirring up our
[1:10:14] spirits
[1:10:16] just in case y'all didn't realize this
[1:10:20] but this isn't the first epidemic that
[1:10:22] the world has
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:29] they've had epidemics of crack
[1:10:37] they've got epidemics of crack epidemics
[1:10:39] of heroin
[1:10:41] the age epidemic ebola epidemic
[1:10:46] hallelujah all these different epidemics
[1:10:48] so what's so different about this
[1:10:50] i'll tell you more people are believing
[1:10:53] in the effect of it
[1:10:56] amen more
[1:10:59] people are giving it power
[1:11:04] because the only power sickness has is
[1:11:07] what we give to it
[1:11:14] label me a fanatic but hey it is what it
[1:11:17] is
[1:11:18] listen listen i might have said this
[1:11:20] last time listen
[1:11:23] it's something shaky about this whole
[1:11:24] thing
[1:11:27] because how you gonna tell me three
[1:11:30] months from now
[1:11:31] they're gonna be more sick people
[1:11:34] how can you predict sickness
[1:11:39] if you ain't help pushing it
[1:11:43] that's like one of you guys walking up
[1:11:45] to me right now say uh
[1:11:47] next year december you're gonna have the
[1:11:48] flu
[1:11:51] i look at you like you crazy
[1:11:54] because literally what you're doing
[1:11:55] you're predicting my future
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:12:00] the devil wants to be so much like god
[1:12:05] he's trying to predict the future and
[1:12:08] these unbelievers are believing him
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:17] i'm sorry y'all i know we're supposed to
[1:12:18] have socialists
[1:12:22] but let me ask you a question how are
[1:12:24] you going to distance yourself from god
[1:12:27] everywhere you go he's there when you
[1:12:29] wake up he's there
[1:12:30] when you go to sleep he's there when
[1:12:32] you're in your car he's there
[1:12:34] when you're in your church he's there
[1:12:36] there is no
[1:12:37] distancing yourself from god
[1:12:41] amen i'm sorry i'm about to close
[1:12:45] but church hallelujah there's something
[1:12:48] real shaky about this whole thing
[1:12:51] numbers are skyrocketing and now they
[1:12:54] got people have been
[1:12:55] inspired like never before they got
[1:12:58] devices where they just shoot you on the
[1:13:00] head and tell your temperature
[1:13:03] i don't know about y'all but i don't
[1:13:04] like stuff like that
[1:13:06] like what what what the hell what you
[1:13:08] doing do my hand
[1:13:11] put that thing up to my head and i'll do
[1:13:13] this you just steal my body see if you
[1:13:15] can get it from my hand
[1:13:16] why you got to shoot my head
[1:13:24] call me crazy but that's just me i don't
[1:13:27] trust nothing that man creates
[1:13:32] it's always something a little shaky
[1:13:33] behind it
[1:13:35] but anyway let me get off there because
[1:13:37] you know i know we got the people who
[1:13:38] say
[1:13:39] well brother dave god gives us a mind
[1:13:43] he gives us a mind to to to make wise
[1:13:46] decisions
[1:13:47] but where's your wisdom coming from come
[1:13:49] on
[1:13:52] i gotta ask i got an answer for you the
[1:13:53] prophet already preached on it
[1:13:55] wisdom versus faith
[1:13:58] holy and he said the first time you add
[1:14:01] your knowledge to it
[1:14:02] it dies right there
[1:14:07] oh my i'm just you know i'm just
[1:14:12] i'm just tired of all the power yeah
[1:14:15] people are giving this spirit
[1:14:19] it's just a spirit and just what jesus
[1:14:22] did in the same day
[1:14:23] devil come out of them he still his
[1:14:26] spirit will still do the same thing
[1:14:28] saint come out of them you call it what
[1:14:31] you want to covet
[1:14:32] over know of it whatever 19 20 21
[1:14:37] it's all the same a
[1:14:41] now spirit me ask you something before
[1:14:43] this covet 19
[1:14:45] how did you handle those six periods
[1:14:52] amen just like you said by the word
[1:14:56] so what's any different from this
[1:14:59] you still ought to live by the word
[1:15:03] holy hey look church hallelujah think
[1:15:06] about it amen
[1:15:07] why the inspiration why there are so
[1:15:08] many people catching the inspiration of
[1:15:11] sickness
[1:15:11] our governor hallelujah caught our
[1:15:14] inspiration he said
[1:15:15] church is essential
[1:15:19] hell yeah some of us are trying to cower
[1:15:21] down
[1:15:22] but god got the worldly people in our
[1:15:25] corner telling us no
[1:15:26] you're going to keep serving god people
[1:15:29] want to quit but they're keeping the
[1:15:30] doors open
[1:15:36] and our president is just on a whole
[1:15:38] nother level
[1:15:42] i don't think i've seen one picture one
[1:15:45] interview
[1:15:46] anything with him with a mask on
[1:15:52] and it was if it was such an epidemic
[1:15:55] you wouldn't protect the leader of the
[1:15:57] country
[1:16:00] think about it i know he crazy but think
[1:16:03] about it
[1:16:08] think about it i shouldn't say crazy i
[1:16:10] should say defiant
[1:16:13] because he's gonna do what he want to do
[1:16:15] and he'll have the mass in his hand like
[1:16:17] this swinger well i had it on when i
[1:16:19] first came in
[1:16:26] let me let me wind us down church but
[1:16:28] look
[1:16:30] what i'm saying church that we've had
[1:16:33] this message for
[1:16:34] over 50 years hallelujah
[1:16:37] so the inspiration should be producing
[1:16:39] heavenly thoughts
[1:16:43] we should be seeing hallelujah of body
[1:16:45] change
[1:16:47] hallelujah because look what changes our
[1:16:50] body
[1:16:50] the word we hear
[1:16:54] and some of us have been hearing truth
[1:16:56] divine
[1:16:57] truth for 20 30 40 years hell yeah
[1:17:03] so you should see yourself changing into
[1:17:06] something
[1:17:06] how by what you're being inspired by
[1:17:10] amen it's the word that changes
[1:17:13] us listen this this
[1:17:17] this this particular quote right here is
[1:17:19] just so powerful
[1:17:20] he said look now we say inspiration is
[1:17:22] is it's an arousal it's god stirring us
[1:17:25] up
[1:17:26] it's a it's a uh divine influence
[1:17:29] but listen this is the prophet he said
[1:17:31] inspiration
[1:17:32] is a paradox
[1:17:36] hallelujah
[1:17:39] inspiration is a paradox see hollywood
[1:17:42] you just can't catch it but it's
[1:17:45] inspired and god
[1:17:46] moves it right into holly's place just
[1:17:49] at that hour when you think not
[1:17:51] now holy if inspiration is a paradox
[1:17:55] let's listen to a paradox a paradox is
[1:17:57] something that's unbelievable
[1:18:01] amen but yet true
[1:18:04] yeah but did you mean to tell me in this
[1:18:08] hour of kobe 19
[1:18:10] you feel that much more inspired earlier
[1:18:13] i can't explain it as a paradox
[1:18:17] yeah i feel even closer to god
[1:18:22] through all my trials through all my
[1:18:24] tribulation hallelujah
[1:18:26] i feel like brother matt how i felt when
[1:18:28] i just got saved
[1:18:30] remember when you just got saved you
[1:18:32] were on fire for god
[1:18:34] amen that's how i feel
[1:18:44] inspiration is a paradox
[1:18:48] it's unbelievable yet true
[1:18:52] so that's unbelievable but true
[1:18:53] hallelujah he says
[1:18:55] how can god take a sinner arrogant
[1:18:57] high-tempered
[1:18:58] fussy man and make a saint of god out of
[1:19:01] him
[1:19:02] amen it's a paradox
[1:19:06] what happens that man or that woman gets
[1:19:09] inspired
[1:19:14] inspired to live higher life
[1:19:18] that's what we all church hallelujah
[1:19:20] listen every time
[1:19:22] hollywood the saints got inspired it was
[1:19:24] calling for a higher living
[1:19:28] from luther to wesley higher living from
[1:19:31] wesley to
[1:19:31] to seymour in the saints higher living
[1:19:34] from brother branham to us
[1:19:40] you notice i didn't put us in the same
[1:19:42] category
[1:19:46] because we're a whole nother generation
[1:19:51] yeah just like the saints did in the
[1:19:53] olden days they quoted moses hallelujah
[1:19:57] for what he had but it was a whole other
[1:19:59] generation
[1:20:01] church and we are like i said 50 years
[1:20:03] post the prophet being here
[1:20:05] a whole nother generation so
[1:20:08] it should be requiring a higher way of
[1:20:11] living
[1:20:17] a higher life a greater understanding
[1:20:22] hallelujah look church all the things
[1:20:26] paul was inspired to preach to his
[1:20:28] church we
[1:20:29] understand it
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:41] we got the inspiration of preachers that
[1:20:43] preached years before our prophet
[1:20:45] preached and then our prophet comes and
[1:20:47] he says
[1:20:47] hey will paul's group be there
[1:20:51] he says because i preached what he
[1:20:53] preached brother brenham caught the same
[1:20:55] inspiration
[1:20:59] but what did he do to believe was life
[1:21:01] it fulfilled a higher calling
[1:21:06] because look paul's church at corinth
[1:21:09] they couldn't walk into love
[1:21:11] but our message gives us perfect love
[1:21:17] the hebrew church or the ephesian church
[1:21:19] they were struggling with adoption
[1:21:21] hollywood
[1:21:21] but adoption is our inheritance
[1:21:27] see church when we really catch the
[1:21:29] inspiration of this message hallelujah
[1:21:31] it calls us to a higher standard of
[1:21:33] living
[1:21:36] i'm not saying we're comparing ourselves
[1:21:38] to ourselves
[1:21:39] no what i'm saying is you should see
[1:21:41] more of god in your walk
[1:21:46] listen he says how can he take a woman
[1:21:49] that's so low
[1:21:50] till the dogs won't even turn hallelujah
[1:21:52] to her
[1:21:53] on the street and make a saint out of a
[1:21:56] saint of god out of her
[1:21:57] i can't tell you but he did it it's a
[1:22:00] paradox
[1:22:01] sure it is all great works are paradoxes
[1:22:07] in my closing
[1:22:10] if we catch the inspiration what i'm
[1:22:13] saying tonight i want to i want to wrap
[1:22:15] it up in this last little bit of what
[1:22:16] i'm saying
[1:22:18] catch the inspiration for your moment
[1:22:21] because
[1:22:21] all of us are in a place we're in a
[1:22:24] place
[1:22:25] in our lives hallelujah but we are
[1:22:28] supposed to catch the inspiration for
[1:22:29] that moment
[1:22:30] holy noah cut the inspiration for his
[1:22:34] moment what was it
[1:22:35] it was to build a ark to go through the
[1:22:37] tribulation
[1:22:38] holy but enoch got the inspiration for
[1:22:40] his moment
[1:22:41] and it wasn't to go in the ark it was
[1:22:43] for the rapture
[1:22:46] hallelujah both on the earth at the same
[1:22:48] time
[1:22:51] but one got the inspiration for
[1:22:52] something higher
[1:22:54] than the other one although they both
[1:22:55] were children of god
[1:22:57] amen although they both heard from god
[1:23:02] but they had different moments
[1:23:07] catch your moment yes amen
[1:23:11] let's look at abraham holly i know i've
[1:23:13] said it about five times
[1:23:15] let's look at abraham church hallelujah
[1:23:17] god came to him and said abraham
[1:23:18] i want you to walk before me and be thou
[1:23:21] perfect
[1:23:22] amen now he had to catch the inspiration
[1:23:26] that he could become perfect that he
[1:23:30] could walk before god and be perfect
[1:23:32] holy
[1:23:32] church how did he get there through all
[1:23:35] the things he went through
[1:23:38] amen look
[1:23:42] he leaves him and sarah walking down
[1:23:45] into
[1:23:45] abimelech's kingdom the king y'all know
[1:23:48] i like talking about this
[1:23:49] the king looking at grandma's again
[1:23:51] great
[1:23:52] day grandma fine
[1:23:55] man i got to have her
[1:23:58] whoa grandma whoa grandma
[1:24:02] got it going on you know how the young
[1:24:05] girls do when they see
[1:24:07] when they see a nice tall dark hamstring
[1:24:10] oh he's hot
[1:24:16] and that's what that's what brimley d
[1:24:17] looked at sarah he's like
[1:24:19] oh she's hot i got to have a he's saying
[1:24:21] this people okay go down there and
[1:24:22] acquire who she is
[1:24:24] but look abraham is catching the
[1:24:26] inspiration
[1:24:27] holding it but he put it in the wrong
[1:24:29] filter
[1:24:31] he's catching the inspiration that sarah
[1:24:34] hurlia
[1:24:34] is going through a body change
[1:24:40] but he missed that body change was for
[1:24:42] him
[1:24:43] not for the king amen
[1:24:47] amen but he was willing to let go
[1:24:51] of the promise that god gave him holy
[1:24:54] because he was afraid
[1:24:58] at the same time he's being inspired
[1:25:05] but he's catching the wrong inspiration
[1:25:09] he said sarah you know what you're my
[1:25:10] sister now
[1:25:13] you know that's the worst thing you can
[1:25:14] do you could be a person that halfway
[1:25:16] lie
[1:25:18] yeah well you know he really didn't lie
[1:25:19] because you know they will
[1:25:21] have sister brothers you know you know
[1:25:23] how we do sometimes well i really didn't
[1:25:25] lie i just said it a different way
[1:25:27] you know your children do that you ask
[1:25:28] them a question and they won't answer
[1:25:30] your question direct
[1:25:32] they go all around your question they
[1:25:35] trying to answer you without telling the
[1:25:36] lie
[1:25:39] say did you go and take that
[1:25:41] refrigerator well um
[1:25:42] when
[1:25:47] i didn't actually win i asked you did
[1:25:50] you did
[1:25:53] did you take what day you talking about
[1:25:59] but church look abraham now he's he's
[1:26:01] catching the inspiration
[1:26:02] he's catching the inspiration that his
[1:26:04] wife has been changed
[1:26:05] but he got fear connected with it
[1:26:09] so he can't elevate his living
[1:26:13] so the king comes down and the king
[1:26:14] catches his inspiration
[1:26:18] the king catches his inspiration and
[1:26:20] comes down and says hey you know i'm
[1:26:21] looking at this this lady right here
[1:26:23] she's gorgeous
[1:26:23] i got to have her and abraham say yeah
[1:26:25] that's my sister go ahead and take her
[1:26:28] and king say okay praise god come on
[1:26:30] come on granny
[1:26:33] he takes her and then god steps in
[1:26:35] hallelujah
[1:26:37] see even in his trouble hallelujah
[1:26:40] god will not let his promises fall to
[1:26:43] the ground
[1:26:45] so even when we mess up the inspiration
[1:26:48] hallelujah
[1:26:49] god will bring it back around to the
[1:26:51] truth
[1:26:54] why why did god do that because god had
[1:26:56] to protect himself
[1:26:58] amen because of the king hallelujah
[1:27:03] would have got sarah hallelujah and
[1:27:05] married her and so forth
[1:27:06] hallelujah it would have made god look
[1:27:08] like he lied
[1:27:11] amen so god protects his inspiration
[1:27:15] amen anyway god comes down tells you
[1:27:18] y'all know the story said give it back
[1:27:20] are you good as a dead man so abraham
[1:27:22] keep going
[1:27:23] you know not him a lot separating not
[1:27:25] get down there and sodom you got to go
[1:27:26] down there
[1:27:27] fight for life all this trouble all this
[1:27:29] trouble god comes in
[1:27:31] god said you know what i'm gonna destroy
[1:27:32] the whole place and abraham say
[1:27:34] you know he got inspired he said what if
[1:27:36] there's 50. well there's 40 30 20 10.
[1:27:40] he was inspired to save life but all he
[1:27:42] could save was lot
[1:27:47] oh my church it was already
[1:27:50] in him to reflect god and be a
[1:27:53] savior see the inspiration was there
[1:27:58] church but look let's fast forward
[1:28:03] abraham and sarah finally has isaac
[1:28:07] but he's still supposed to be inspired
[1:28:10] they finally have isaac
[1:28:11] and you know then god comes and god want
[1:28:14] to see
[1:28:15] did he really catch the inspiration god
[1:28:17] comes and he says hey
[1:28:19] i want you to kill him go take them burn
[1:28:21] them up
[1:28:22] put them to the stake chop them up do
[1:28:24] everything you know how you sacrifice
[1:28:26] so abraham he says okay god gets up off
[1:28:29] his knees raises up the next morning
[1:28:31] but now in the midst of everything he
[1:28:34] heard from god
[1:28:35] he catches some inspiration
[1:28:39] wow he heard what god said go offer your
[1:28:42] son up
[1:28:43] but then there's a higher inspiration
[1:28:45] that comes this way
[1:28:46] holy something that god didn't even say
[1:28:50] to him
[1:28:53] amen something that has never been
[1:28:57] spoken before hallelujah
[1:28:59] but he's being inspired hallelujah and
[1:29:01] he he
[1:29:02] he he gathers up all the bags and
[1:29:04] everything he tells isaac come
[1:29:06] but before he leaves he looks at his
[1:29:08] servants and he says i'm the lag gonna
[1:29:10] go
[1:29:10] and now the lag gonna turn what was that
[1:29:13] that was inspiration
[1:29:19] god didn't tell him that where did it
[1:29:21] come from
[1:29:27] it was the nature of the seed coming out
[1:29:34] in the midst of trouble church in the
[1:29:36] midst of your trouble
[1:29:38] who do you reflect amen
[1:29:42] and because abraham was the father of
[1:29:44] faith that's who he was
[1:29:46] in the midst of his trouble all he could
[1:29:49] do was reflect
[1:29:50] that he is the father of faith
[1:29:54] so church from there he's inspired and
[1:29:56] he tells us she tells his servants
[1:29:58] i'm the last gonna go and out of that
[1:30:00] gonna turn
[1:30:01] gonna return now that's in the air the
[1:30:04] spoken word has went out holy
[1:30:06] and you know the bible says hallelujah
[1:30:08] that no word will return unto god
[1:30:10] void nothing will come back but it'll go
[1:30:13] out and accomplish
[1:30:15] that which he's sent it out to do holly
[1:30:19] so now abraham is speaking as a god
[1:30:23] he's inspired he says how to let him go
[1:30:26] out of the leg
[1:30:27] return so he gets out there he gets to
[1:30:29] the spot he sees the area
[1:30:30] he starts to build y'all to hallelujah
[1:30:33] he's inspired he's building an altar he
[1:30:35] tells isaac go gather some wood
[1:30:36] isaac go gathers the wood holly now
[1:30:38] isaac is looking around
[1:30:42] and he's catching the inspiration
[1:30:45] he says hey
[1:30:49] something right he says hey dad
[1:30:52] we got the altar we even got the wood
[1:30:56] but where's the sacrifice here comes the
[1:30:59] inspiration
[1:31:01] he says god shall provide himself
[1:31:04] a sacrifice and right there
[1:31:08] in that moment those words of
[1:31:10] inspiration
[1:31:11] created what he needed in that moment
[1:31:16] what about you in your moment he's still
[1:31:19] god
[1:31:21] it's still he's still inspiring us
[1:31:24] but you know we do we're so afraid of
[1:31:27] being wrong
[1:31:29] if it's real inspiration it's not you
[1:31:31] it's god
[1:31:33] amen
[1:31:36] let me close i got a lot of things i can
[1:31:38] say
[1:31:39] but i think you got me listen when the
[1:31:42] prophet of god was talking about job
[1:31:44] he said job was trying to catch the
[1:31:47] inspiration
[1:31:49] he said while he was going through all
[1:31:50] that different stuff he was trying to
[1:31:52] catch the inspiration
[1:31:54] he said when you know you've doubted
[1:31:55] every dotted every eye and crossed every
[1:31:57] t
[1:31:58] he said that's when you hold still and
[1:32:01] you know that
[1:32:01] god is with you no you have to be
[1:32:04] certain of god then
[1:32:07] that's when you catch the right
[1:32:08] inspiration
[1:32:10] but when you catch it for your moment
[1:32:12] holy there'll be things that take place
[1:32:15] hallelujah that may not even be written
[1:32:18] on paper
[1:32:19] amen church a couple weeks ago we was
[1:32:26] having church
[1:32:28] and after we had church it turned into a
[1:32:30] praise service
[1:32:32] and we worshiped and we sung for about
[1:32:34] another hour and a half
[1:32:37] and it was a sister visiting because one
[1:32:39] of the brothers one of the brothers had
[1:32:41] had a wedding and it was a sister
[1:32:43] visiting from

[1:32:50] and i was preaching a message that
[1:32:52] sunday morning called
[1:32:54] god turning your negative into a
[1:32:55] positive amen
[1:32:58] and i was saying that morning that you
[1:33:00] have to go through the negative
[1:33:02] before you get to the positive
[1:33:05] because it's the negative hallelujah
[1:33:08] that makes the positive what it is
[1:33:11] hallelujah you know we'll say a lot of
[1:33:14] times no
[1:33:14] no i just i just want the blessings of
[1:33:16] god no holy
[1:33:18] it's the things you suffer that brings
[1:33:20] forth the character
[1:33:23] it ain't the mountaintops experiences
[1:33:25] it's the valley lows
[1:33:27] holly but anyway i was preaching about
[1:33:29] the negative it's negative and negative
[1:33:31] and so much and
[1:33:32] turn into a positive and look hallelujah

[1:33:36] hey you could have the nicest car in the
[1:33:38] parking lot you have gas spot plugs
[1:33:40] every stuff
[1:33:41] all that but if your battery is not
[1:33:43] grounded to the negative the car won't
[1:33:48] move
[1:33:52] so would you be who you are without the
[1:33:55] negative experiences you've had
[1:34:00] i'll say it again like i said earlier

[1:47:11] amen i say lord i want to be inspired by
[1:47:13] the right thing
[1:47:14] you know i was thinking just last week
[1:47:17] i've read a couple scriptures in romans
[1:47:20] 9
[1:47:20] 7 the bible talks about pharaoh and says
[1:47:23] for this same
[1:47:24] purpose speaking of pharaoh the pharaoh
[1:47:27] who
[1:47:28] persecuted the egyptians i mean the
[1:47:30] israelites out of egypt
[1:47:32] and uh and and you know you know the
[1:47:35] entire story of the
[1:47:36] exodus and paul says for this purpose
[1:47:39] god said
[1:47:39] for this purpose i raised you up so
[1:47:42] there was an inspiration
[1:47:44] that someone had to fulfill and he was
[1:47:47] raised up for a purpose i thought of the
[1:47:49] same thing
[1:47:50] about judas and over in acts it says
[1:47:53] acts 1 16 says men and brethren this
[1:47:56] scripture speaking of judas must
[1:47:59] needs have been fulfilled which the holy
[1:48:03] ghost by the mouth of david spoke
[1:48:05] before concerning judas which was
[1:48:08] which was to guide them that took jesus
[1:48:10] i thought about that and thought
[1:48:12] everyone has to play a part everybody
[1:48:17] the republicans has to play a part the
[1:48:19] democrats have to play a part
[1:48:20] the catholic church has to play a part
[1:48:22] the evangelicals have to play a part
[1:48:24] you know brother branham said there's
[1:48:26] three kinds of believers
[1:48:27] and he said there's a mate believer
[1:48:29] there's an unbeliever and then there's a
[1:48:31] believer
[1:48:32] and you know brother diggs after hearing
[1:48:33] that tonight i'll just
[1:48:35] go further and say that there's an
[1:48:37] inspiration
[1:48:39] for the unbeliever to not believe
[1:48:41] there's an inspiration for the make
[1:48:43] believer to make believe
[1:48:45] but i'm glad there's an inspiration for
[1:48:47] the believer
[1:48:48] and it's to believe the word of god and
[1:48:50] i say lord let me play my part
[1:48:52] let me not be a pharaoh let me not be a
[1:48:54] judas amen let me come under the right
[1:48:57] inspiration
