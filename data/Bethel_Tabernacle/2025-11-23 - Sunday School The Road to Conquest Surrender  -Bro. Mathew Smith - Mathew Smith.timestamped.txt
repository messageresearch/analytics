[5:17] Good morning. to stand and have a word
[5:20] of prayer.
[5:22] Father, Lord, we come before you this
[5:24] morning.
[5:26] Lord,
[5:28] eager to be in your presence,
[5:31] Lord, we want want to invite you here,
[5:34] knowing, Lord, that we've gathered in
[5:36] your name. And when we would gather in
[5:38] your name and invite you, you being a
[5:40] gentleman, you would never miss an
[5:42] invitation.
[5:44] Father, that you would love to move,
[5:46] talk with your people, that here we are
[5:48] in the this Sunday morning, that your
[5:51] spirit could come down and dwell with
[5:53] your children, commune with us.
[5:56] Father, that you would be with us for
[5:58] these few minutes that we have here for
[6:00] this Sunday school. That Lord, you would
[6:04] have a preeminence in this as well as
[6:05] all things that we would do. that Lord,
[6:08] maybe you would inspire something that
[6:11] would be said, Father, it would
[6:15] encourage somebody,
[6:18] Father, that they'd be able to take
[6:20] these things and as they would face the
[6:24] the day that we live in, Lord, that
[6:25] they'd be able to combat it, they'd be
[6:29] able to to withstand the the devil
[6:33] and his program for their lives. that
[6:36] Lord we you would be have the
[6:38] preeminence in this service that into
[6:39] the song service and into the main
[6:42] service Lord that your spirit would have
[6:44] full preeminence in this place. We ask
[6:47] these things in the name of the Lord
[6:48] Jesus Christ. Amen. I want to read
[6:52] quickly um and I'll just read it for the
[6:55] sake of time so you all can sit down. Um
[6:59] this is uh Ephesians
[7:02] 6 and verse 12. It says, "For we wrestle
[7:05] not against flesh and blood, but against
[7:06] principalities, against powers, against
[7:08] the rulers of the darkness of this
[7:10] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[7:13] high places." Y'all can be seated.
[7:17] Um, I want to take sort of as a theme,
[7:21] spiritual warfare.
[7:23] Um,
[7:26] you know, the in in uh Romans 8, it says
[7:29] that we'd be made more than conquerors,
[7:31] right?
[7:32] And um for a title for this series, I I
[7:35] put um the road the title is the road to
[7:38] conquest. I don't know. Well, I say it's
[7:40] a series. I don't know. I might do some
[7:42] more on this. I I probably will. Um
[7:45] but um so I want to talk about spiritual
[7:49] warfare. And I want to note here it
[7:52] says, "For we wrestle not against flesh
[7:53] and blood." And I've said this
[7:57] um a few times um but I'll say it again.
[7:59] You know, when it says that we wrest not
[8:01] against flesh and blood, you know, but
[8:03] against principalities and against
[8:04] powers and against rulers of the
[8:06] darkness of this world, you know, we're,
[8:08] you know, we all recognize this. We're
[8:09] all educated people, you know, in the
[8:10] word and we recognize, okay, this is
[8:12] Paul speaking about spiritual warfare.
[8:16] And what we as humans tend to do
[8:19] instinctively and kind of without
[8:21] thinking about it, but we just sort of
[8:23] subconsciously do this is we go, "Ah,
[8:26] it's a metaphor for warfare. or it's a
[8:30] metaphorical war that we're involved in
[8:33] or it's an analogy that is sort of like
[8:36] war. No, that's not what Paul said. It
[8:39] is you are in an actual literal real
[8:41] deal war and it's not
[8:45] a metaphor. It's literally war. And
[8:49] in fact, you know, if we say the natural
[8:51] types of spiritual and if the natural
[8:52] world is a shadow of the spirit of the
[8:55] spiritual world, then in fact, the war
[8:57] that you're involved in is actually
[9:01] far more serious than any physical war
[9:04] that you could ever be involved in. Um,
[9:07] you know, as and as as extreme as that
[9:09] may be, you know, we look at something
[9:11] like the Second World War in which, you
[9:13] know, the use of nuclear weapons ended
[9:15] that war. What's more serious than the
[9:17] use of nuclear weapons? What's more
[9:19] horrifying than that? And yet that is a
[9:22] shadow. That's just a silhouette, right,
[9:24] of the actual real
[9:28] conflict in the spiritual world that's
[9:31] taking place. And it's actually the in
[9:33] the spiritual the spiritual the the
[9:35] total the ramifications of the spiritual
[9:37] world are far more horrifying if you
[9:40] really knew the full scope and scale of
[9:43] what's at stake here. is far more
[9:44] extreme, far more serious, and and
[9:46] should be far more um taken far more
[9:49] seriously than even a real physical
[9:51] conflict that you might be, you know, be
[9:54] able to see with your with your eyes.
[9:58] And so, you know, it would just it just
[10:00] sort of behooves us that, you know, to
[10:01] to kind of
[10:04] you know, um maybe if we thought about
[10:07] it in those terms, maybe if we took it a
[10:09] little bit more seriously and and
[10:11] thought about it in those terms, we
[10:12] would be a little bit less um uh lax in
[10:17] a lot of the ways that we we you know
[10:19] approach things.
[10:22] Um
[10:25] now
[10:26] I want to you know obviously because of
[10:29] spiritual war and you know um the
[10:34] the the the
[10:37] we've we've all been you know we've been
[10:39] in the message for you know a certain
[10:40] amount of time. If you've been in the
[10:41] message for any amount of time, I'm sure
[10:43] we've all been taught that really the
[10:45] the pathway, you know, that the n due to
[10:49] the nature of the battle that we're
[10:50] engaged in that the actual
[10:54] um true path to victory is through
[10:56] surrender and surrender to the word of
[10:58] God, right? That you surrender to the
[11:00] word and in doing so you that's the only
[11:02] real pathway to victory in this
[11:05] spiritual war. Um, now I want to read a
[11:08] passage from Romans 8 is 8 Romans 8
[11:10] 1-11.
[11:13] And I want to read this because it's
[11:18] it shows sort of encapsulating
[11:21] sort of a a a breakdown of what this the
[11:25] spiritual war that you're engaged in
[11:26] kind of looks like, right? What's really
[11:29] the dynamics here? So this is Romans 8
[11:33] and verse one. It says there there is
[11:35] therefore now no condemnation to them
[11:37] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[11:39] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[11:41] For the law of the spirit of life in
[11:44] Christ Jesus hath made me free from the
[11:48] law of sin and death. For what the law
[11:50] could not do in that it was weak through
[11:54] the flesh. God sending his own son in
[11:57] the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[12:00] condemned sin in the flesh that the
[12:03] righteousness of the law might be
[12:05] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[12:08] flesh but after the spirit. For they
[12:10] that are after the flesh do mind the
[12:14] things of the flesh, but they that are
[12:16] after the spirit the things of the
[12:18] spirit. But to be carnally minded is
[12:21] death, but to be spiritually minded is
[12:24] life and peace. Because the carnal mind
[12:27] is immity against God, for it is not
[12:30] subject to the law of God, neither
[12:32] indeed can be. So then, they that are in
[12:36] the flesh cannot please God. But ye are
[12:39] not in the flesh, but in the spirit. If
[12:41] so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[12:43] you. Now if any man have not the spirit
[12:46] of Christ, he is none of his. And if
[12:49] Christ be in you, the body is dead
[12:51] because of sin. But the spirit is life
[12:53] because of righteousness. But if the
[12:55] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[12:57] the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[13:00] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[13:02] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[13:04] dwelleth in you.
[13:06] And so we see here that there's this
[13:08] there's this this um dynamic of there's
[13:11] the flesh and the things of the flesh
[13:13] and the carnal, right? That's what
[13:15] carnal means, right? means things of the
[13:17] flesh
[13:18] and and the natural world that you live
[13:20] in versus things of the spirit. And the
[13:23] only way and so it's this constant
[13:25] battle of the of the flesh and and the
[13:27] natural world and and the world that you
[13:30] live in being running directly contrary
[13:32] to the word of God. And there's the
[13:34] that's where the battle is, right? We
[13:35] talked about the greatest battle ever
[13:36] fought being hap taking place in the
[13:39] minds of people, mind of man.
[13:42] And so what is that? It's your body,
[13:46] your flesh, the the the the sinful man
[13:48] that you were shackled to at birth
[13:51] trying to do one thing and then the
[13:53] spirit of God inside of you trying to do
[13:56] something else. Right? And there's where
[13:58] your conflict is. This is why,
[14:02] you know, people, especially new
[14:04] Christians or people who've never really
[14:05] got the new birth, think that if you
[14:07] just get the Holy Ghost that that's sort
[14:10] of the end of the of your of your
[14:12] struggles. And that is absolutely wrong.
[14:16] If anything, it doesn't start till you
[14:18] get the Holy Ghost. Really doesn't
[14:19] really start because most of the time,
[14:21] you know, if you're just a sinner,
[14:22] unconverted sinner, and you have the
[14:24] desires of things of the world, you go
[14:26] do something wrong. Well, there's no
[14:28] conflict there. You wanted to do it, you
[14:30] did it, and you don't feel bad about it,
[14:33] right? There's no there's no conflict
[14:35] there. But if you do something wrong and
[14:37] there's a spirit, there's a seed of God
[14:39] inside of you. that spirit is con is is
[14:42] bringing a a um conviction constantly
[14:45] bringing conviction. Well, now there's
[14:48] now there's a conflict because now
[14:50] there's the spirit being at war with
[14:52] with Satan, right? There's the the the
[14:54] flesh now has something to fight
[14:55] against, right? There's there's no
[14:56] battle if there's no if there's not two
[14:58] combatants, right?
[15:00] And so, if the spirit of God dwells in
[15:02] you now, you're going to have a constant
[15:04] battle with that flesh, right? It's not
[15:06] just going to be the flesh walking away
[15:08] with the victory every time.
[15:11] And
[15:13] you know, so really the the battle here
[15:17] is between the flesh and the Holy Spirit
[15:19] that would come down and indwell that
[15:21] flesh and anoint it. And it requires a
[15:23] certain amount of surrender to the word
[15:25] of God to allow that process to happen.
[15:28] You know, that's, you know, you, like we
[15:30] said in Romans chapter 8, what we just
[15:31] read, it's Paul showing the distinction
[15:34] of the unconverted man versus somebody
[15:37] with a new birth, right? That's the
[15:39] distinction. That's what Paul's talking
[15:40] about, right? If if the, you know, if
[15:43] the spirit of him that raised up Christ
[15:45] from the dead um dwell in you, well,
[15:49] what's the spirit dwelling in you?
[15:50] That's the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[15:52] That's the Holy Spirit coming down and
[15:54] bringing a new birth.
[15:56] Um
[15:58] but if we at so then the question
[16:01] becomes well how do you get the Holy
[16:04] Ghost? Well we know that the process of
[16:06] of receiving the baptism of the Holy
[16:08] Ghost starts with repentance.
[16:11] That's the start which repentance right
[16:14] I I I looked this up. Um, we all think
[16:16] we know what a lot of these words mean,
[16:18] but you actually read a a definition
[16:20] once in a while and you go, "Huh, I
[16:21] didn't think about it." Not not so much
[16:23] that you didn't think about it that way,
[16:24] but it really kind of brings into stark
[16:26] um,
[16:28] you know, real stark what it really
[16:30] means to you, you know,
[16:32] to repent. This is from Webster. It
[16:34] says, "The definition of the word repent
[16:37] is to turn from sin and dedicate oneself
[16:40] to the amendment of one's life."
[16:44] That's
[16:47] that it's and you know and that's the
[16:48] first definition and the second
[16:49] definition is to feel regret or
[16:51] contrition or to change one's mind. But
[16:54] I like that first definition to turn
[16:56] from sin and dedicate oneself to the
[16:57] amendment of one's life.
[17:00] And when you think about it in that
[17:01] those terms, a lot of people have this
[17:03] mentality that well the the baptism of
[17:05] the Holy Ghost is just me being sorry.
[17:09] Yeah, it is sort of it's going to
[17:11] require you feeling sorry. It's going to
[17:13] require some contrition. It's going to
[17:15] require a a recognition that what you've
[17:17] done is wrong and that the way you've
[17:19] been living is wrong. But it's also
[17:22] going to require that you now have
[17:23] dedicated your life to the amendment of
[17:26] it. You've dedicated yourself to the
[17:28] amendment of your life of to changing
[17:30] it. You're not just going to remain
[17:32] doing what you're doing. Surrender.
[17:35] That's and repentance is an act of
[17:36] surrender. saying going to the word of
[17:39] God and saying, "My life doesn't line up
[17:40] with this." And so now I'm changing what
[17:43] I'm doing. I'm surrendering. I'm no
[17:45] longer going to be combative against
[17:48] this, right? Because again, in Romans 8,
[17:50] it says that the the carnal mind is
[17:52] immity against God, right? Immnity is is
[17:55] to be um uh combative against it. It's
[17:58] to be um you know, contrary. It's to be
[18:01] at odds with, right? If you if you have
[18:04] the your your your carnal mind is
[18:06] literally at war with the word of God
[18:07] and it's going to do anything it can to
[18:09] to not be in submission to the word.
[18:15] But
[18:17] and so you know repentance is is the
[18:20] recognition that what you've done is
[18:21] wrong and that you're submitting
[18:22] yourself to the word of God. Now when we
[18:25] look at
[18:28] take the word surrender, right? And and
[18:31] again, we have and and oftentimes it's
[18:34] the word of or or the way that we
[18:35] describe these things. You know, we talk
[18:37] about, you know, well, it's not I that
[18:39] live, it's Christ that lives within me
[18:40] and it's it's the Lord is in my life and
[18:43] has changed my desires and and all of
[18:44] those things are true,
[18:47] but a lot of times I feel like people
[18:50] get this mentality, this idea that,
[18:52] well, if I just, you know, you know, in
[18:55] a service say, "Lord, I surrender. I I
[18:57] repent." And then the Lord's just gonna
[18:59] fix your life. And to some degree, the
[19:02] Lord will fix your life. But the Lord is
[19:05] going to do that, but it's going to
[19:06] require you to repent. It's going to
[19:08] require you that you've dedicated
[19:09] yourself to the amendment of it. You
[19:11] don't I mean, think about it like this.
[19:14] Maybe this will just illustrate what I'm
[19:15] trying to get at. Imagine you have, you
[19:19] know, two armies fighting each other and
[19:22] they're they're, you know, shooting at
[19:24] each other and artillery shells and
[19:25] missiles and bombs and the whole works.
[19:27] And then one general calls the other up
[19:29] up on the radio and says, "Hey, um, we
[19:30] surrender."
[19:32] And, you know, we surrender. We
[19:34] surrender. You know, you you can stop
[19:36] shooting at us. We surrender. And he's
[19:37] like, "All right, well,
[19:40] you know, why are you throw down your
[19:42] arms, stop the missiles?" And he's like,
[19:44] "No, no, I'm not going to I'm not going
[19:45] to change any of the way I'm living
[19:47] right now. I'm not going to stop doing
[19:49] any of the stuff that I'm doing. I'm
[19:51] just letting you know that we
[19:52] surrender."
[19:54] It's like, what? That's not a that
[19:56] that's meaningless. that that you you
[19:58] you're saying words but they're not
[19:59] attached to anything, right? You know,
[20:02] it's like, you know, he's he's like, you
[20:04] know, oh, we surrender. Yeah, fire
[20:05] another missile. Like, what? That's not
[20:07] you don't get to say, Lord, I surrender.
[20:09] But in your heart, you know, you're just
[20:11] going to go keep doing what you're
[20:12] doing. That's not a surrender. As a
[20:15] matter of fact,
[20:17] if you were if a if a military was to
[20:18] actually do that to to declare a
[20:20] surrender, but but not actually stop
[20:22] fighting, that's a war crime. It's
[20:24] called a false surrender. It was it's a
[20:26] known thing that happens. And I wonder
[20:29] how many people have committed war
[20:32] crimes against God
[20:35] where they they they come to church,
[20:36] they something convicts their heart and
[20:38] they say, "Oh, you know, Lord, I
[20:39] surrender." But there's no real
[20:41] intention to change anything that
[20:43] they're doing. There's no actual
[20:45] repentance. There's no dedication to the
[20:47] amendment of their life,
[20:51] you know. And so,
[20:54] you know, we look at um at I would say
[20:58] one of the ultimate examples of what
[21:01] surrender looks like is Christ in in
[21:05] Gethsemane saying,
[21:08] you know, here he well this is Luke from
[21:11] Luke 22:4 Luke 20 chapter 22:42 says
[21:14] saying, "Father, if thou be willing,
[21:16] remove this cup from me. Nevertheless,
[21:18] not my will, but thine be done.
[21:22] The fact that Christ draws a distinction
[21:24] between his own will and the will of the
[21:26] father directly tells us that within his
[21:29] flesh, he had a will that was contrary
[21:32] to the word of God. The word said he had
[21:34] to die, but his will was for that cup to
[21:36] be removed from him. Now, that is kind
[21:39] of a thing that might get people to
[21:40] throw rocks at you to say to say, "Yeah,
[21:43] Christ had a will that was contrary to
[21:45] word of God." It's like, wait, what? How
[21:47] can you even say that? But but here he
[21:50] is. He's saying, I don't want to die,
[21:51] but the word of God said he had to die,
[21:53] but he didn't want to.
[21:56] Well, if Christ, literally, God made
[21:58] flesh had a will that he had to
[22:01] sacrifice,
[22:03] what do you think you have, right? If
[22:07] Christ had no desire in his flesh that
[22:09] would be satisfied by something that was
[22:11] contrary to the word of word then how
[22:14] could he be tempted in any meaningful
[22:16] way right if this again this is from
[22:19] Websters to tempt to entice to do wrong
[22:23] by promise of pleasure or gain it's
[22:25] synonymous with lure seduce or entice
[22:30] if there was nothing if there was no
[22:31] desire in Christ that could be satisfied
[22:34] by something contrary to the word of
[22:36] Then Hebrews 4:15 becomes meaningless.
[22:40] For we have not an high priest which
[22:42] cannot be touched with a feeling of our
[22:44] infirmities, but was in all points
[22:46] tempted like as we are yet without sin.
[22:50] So if Christ if there was nothing in
[22:52] Christ in his flesh that that could be
[22:55] tempted, then there's no temptation,
[22:58] right? If there's but but he had to be
[23:00] will he had obviously but there's you're
[23:02] not no one's going to say that Jesus
[23:04] didn't have the Holy Ghost. He was the
[23:05] Holy Ghost,
[23:07] right? So, do you think that if you have
[23:09] the Holy Ghost, you're not going to be
[23:10] tempted? There's nothing going to be in
[23:11] your flesh that wants to do something
[23:13] contrary to the word of God. That that
[23:15] doesn't check. Right. So,
[23:20] but it so the sin is not the temptation.
[23:22] The sin is is is caving, right? The sin
[23:26] is
[23:28] not
[23:29] bringing that temptation subject to the
[23:31] word and saying no even though there's a
[23:33] desire there will not be a a an action
[23:37] right you know the listen if if in the
[23:41] wilderness when Christ was tempted in
[23:43] the wilderness and and um
[23:46] the devil comes to him and says turn
[23:48] these stones into bread well he's not he
[23:52] didn't just pick bread willy-nilly
[23:55] Christ hadn't eaten for 40 days. There
[23:58] was something there that would have
[23:59] really been satisfied. That would have
[24:01] been really tempted. There's a hunger
[24:03] there that's going to be tempted to do
[24:05] that. Right? The you know there's
[24:08] there's when you're starving then you
[24:11] know the temptation to use the word of
[24:13] God to do something carnal becomes to to
[24:16] feed that hunger is going to be is going
[24:17] to be high. So,
[24:20] you know, this again this idea you're
[24:22] going to be shackled to this thing and
[24:26] you know it's not going to listen the
[24:28] the the the battle that you're in is not
[24:33] laying down and dying and being like
[24:36] well if I'm not supposed to do this then
[24:39] the Lord will just take the desire from
[24:40] me which there is a certain amount of
[24:42] that. I I mean, look, I'm I'm not
[24:46] there was a a point in which I was did
[24:48] not have the Holy Ghost and my all of my
[24:51] desires were for like weed, whiskey, and
[24:53] women,
[24:55] but I don't desire those things now
[24:58] because
[25:00] the Lord changed something in me, right?
[25:02] Those desires went away when I got the
[25:04] Holy Ghost. But that doesn't mean that
[25:05] if I'm, you know, have a come home from
[25:09] a hard day's work and my body hurts,
[25:12] like, you know, there's the there's that
[25:15] thing in the back of your head that
[25:16] goes, man, you know, a couple milligrams
[25:18] of THC will really fix this for you. But
[25:21] I don't do that. I there's no I don't
[25:23] really have a desire for it. But I in my
[25:25] flesh, it it wouldn't just Are we all
[25:28] following here? Right?
[25:30] You know, I'm I have the Holy Ghost. I
[25:33] don't I don't I don't have a lust
[25:34] problem. But that doesn't mean that if
[25:36] if a a woman were to, you know, present
[25:38] herself uh unholy be, you know, without
[25:41] holiness before me that I would I would
[25:43] have to turn my head. Why? I have to do
[25:46] something. I actually have to turn my
[25:47] head and look away because if I didn't,
[25:49] I would have a problem,
[25:52] right? The Holy The Holy Ghost doesn't
[25:55] mean that I I I lose my my my uh my
[25:58] desire. It just means that I do
[26:01] something about it.
[26:02] right? The you know this there's this at
[26:06] the end of the day
[26:12] well let me let me just read this. This
[26:14] is um
[26:20] this is uh from the res the resurrection
[26:23] of Jas's daughter in 1954.
[26:27] Um, this is him talking about how he
[26:30] Christ had gone to the pool and of all
[26:32] the and there was sick people all the
[26:33] way all around the pool and he's going
[26:34] there to heal one person and then leave,
[26:36] right? And there's people all around
[26:38] this pool. There's sick people
[26:40] everywhere. Everyone's got a need, but
[26:42] he's going to go heal one person and
[26:44] leave.
[26:46] He says, "But sometimes people don't
[26:49] know what love is."
[26:53] And you get love and sympathy mixed up.
[26:56] Love is obedience.
[27:00] God speaks. It's obedience regardless of
[27:03] what sympathy or anything else is. No
[27:06] wonder he said there in the garden of
[27:08] Gethsemane his sympathy to leave his
[27:11] friends and everything, but said, "Thy
[27:14] will be done." That's right. That's
[27:17] love. That's real love is obedience.
[27:21] There he passed by. Sure. His heart bled
[27:25] for that poor little mother standing
[27:26] there with the waterhead baby and the
[27:28] poor old blind father crippled up with
[27:30] arthritis.
[27:31] Right?
[27:33] And then you know I won't finish the the
[27:35] quote there for the sake of time but
[27:37] here he is. Here's Christ under the
[27:39] under the direction of almighty God to
[27:41] go to a pool where surrounded by sick
[27:43] people heal one person and leave. And in
[27:46] his flesh here's brother Brandham
[27:47] telling us that in his flesh Jesus
[27:50] wanted to heal every single person
[27:51] there. But the but the Lord told him to
[27:53] heal one person and leave.
[27:56] Now that's hard, right? Like so I'm just
[27:59] I'm just illustrating and again I I
[28:01] really want to nail this down. Listen,
[28:03] the battle that you're going to fight is
[28:04] not
[28:06] a battle where we just surrender to God
[28:08] as if is some sort of like I don't it
[28:10] become it turns the word surrender into
[28:12] a platitude of just sort of like well
[28:15] it's just something we say but there's
[28:16] no actual meaning attached to it. How
[28:19] does that work? When you when you do it,
[28:21] it means that your heart's going to ache
[28:23] for something and you know and you have
[28:26] to shut that down and you have to squash
[28:27] it and say, "I'm I can't the the Bible
[28:31] says something different." Right? And
[28:34] because at the end of the day, the
[28:35] truth,
[28:39] you know, I I find it so man, it's so
[28:41] potent that brother Brandham equated
[28:44] obedience to love. And and it's it's
[28:46] scriptural. Jesus said, "If you love me,
[28:48] you'll keep my commandments." Right? Um
[28:51] that's St. John 14:15. If you love me,
[28:53] keep my commandments.
[28:55] So, think about this for a second. If if
[28:58] love equals obedience, anywhere that you
[29:01] talk where it talks about the love of
[29:03] God or you loving God is directly tied
[29:06] to obedience to the word of God, right?
[29:09] You can't separate the two. Next time
[29:11] you read a passage that says, you know,
[29:12] talks about God loving you or or that,
[29:15] you know, those that would love God,
[29:17] just fill that word in. Put obedience in
[29:20] there and see how how it reads, right?
[29:23] Equate that to with obedience to the
[29:25] word of God. Because and you know, and
[29:28] it and it's many people have said this
[29:30] before. I'm not the only one.
[29:34] You know, true love does not sacrifice
[29:36] the truth on the altar of kindness or
[29:38] niceness.
[29:41] Right? It doesn't do that. And so many
[29:45] times we, you know, our,
[29:52] you know, our our our our natural heart
[29:55] wants to,
[29:58] you know, we we shy away from from from
[30:02] the truth because it's not nice. It
[30:04] doesn't make us feel good.
[30:07] But the reality is there has to be a
[30:09] surrender. There has to be the battle
[30:11] that you're facing is one in which it's
[30:14] whether or not you're going to say even
[30:17] though in my flesh I really don't want
[30:19] to do this. Even in my flesh I really
[30:22] want to do something but but you're
[30:23] going to bring that desire subject to
[30:25] the word. And it's not always going to
[30:28] be,
[30:30] you know, the Holy Ghost isn't just
[30:31] going to, you know, bonk you on the head
[30:33] with a magic wand and be like, well, you
[30:36] know, You have everything's right now.
[30:38] You You have no more struggles with
[30:40] anything ever. It's not how it works.
[30:43] It's never how it worked. Even Christ
[30:45] had to be was going to encounter places
[30:48] where he he he wanted to run away. Like
[30:51] in his flesh, he did not want to go to a
[30:52] cross. Nobody does. Right. in his and in
[30:56] our flesh. There's going to be times
[30:58] where the the the word is going to ask
[31:00] you to do something that you really
[31:02] really do not want to do. And you're
[31:05] gonna have to just well, if you're going
[31:06] to be a Christian, you you got to be
[31:08] Christlike.
[31:10] And you have to be willing to say, "Not
[31:11] my will, thine be done."
[31:14] And I'll I I'll finish with this because
[31:16] I'm out of time here, but I just want to
[31:20] um
[31:22] uh
[31:25] I'll I'll just read, you know, these two
[31:27] quickly these two scriptures. James 4:7,
[31:30] submit yourselves therefore to God.
[31:32] Resist the devil and he will flee from
[31:34] you. True surrender, that's uh James
[31:37] 4:7. True surrender is setting aside the
[31:39] desires of the flesh and bringing your
[31:40] flesh into submission to the word of
[31:42] God. even if in your flesh you do not
[31:44] want to. Resisting the devil speaks of
[31:46] overcoming temptation. If there is no
[31:48] desire in your flesh that is even
[31:49] vulnerable to temptation, then then this
[31:51] verse becomes meaningless.
[31:55] Um now I want to read this is uh Romans
[31:58] also Romans 8 but this is towards the
[32:00] end of the chapter um starting at verse
[32:01] 35. Who shall separate us from the love
[32:03] of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress
[32:06] or persecution or famine or nakedness or
[32:07] peril or sword? As it is written, for
[32:10] thy sake we are killed all the day long.
[32:12] We are accounted as sheep for the
[32:13] slaughter. Verse 37. Nay, in all these
[32:16] things we are more than conquerors
[32:18] through him that loved us. For I am
[32:20] persuaded that neither death, nor life,
[32:22] nor angels, nor principalities, nor
[32:25] powers, nor things present, nor things
[32:26] to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
[32:28] other creature shall be able to separate
[32:30] us from the love of God which is in
[32:32] Christ Jesus our Lord. Now I want to
[32:34] focus in on this scripture. Verse 37.
[32:36] Nay, in all these things we are uh more
[32:39] than conquerors through him that loved
[32:40] us. That word, that phrase more than
[32:43] conquerors is actually a single Greek
[32:46] word that we don't really have a direct
[32:48] translation for. So we have to use a
[32:49] phrase to translate it.
[32:52] Um the Greek word there is hyperikoman.
[32:57] Niko you might be familiar with the term
[32:59] nicicoatin meaning to conquer the leoty.
[33:01] So Nikoman means conqueror and hyper
[33:05] means hyper, right? Like we use the term
[33:08] hypersonic for like a like a cruise
[33:11] missile, right? Like a hypersonic
[33:13] missile doesn't just move faster than
[33:16] the speed of sound by a little bit. It's
[33:17] like 25 times faster than the speed of
[33:19] sound. So supersonic doesn't really cut
[33:21] it anymore. So we have to make a new
[33:23] word. Well, that's what this is. It is
[33:26] hyper.
[33:28] Maybe a a more colloquial or modern
[33:31] translation of the word more than
[33:32] conquer or that phrase more than
[33:33] conquerors would be to say we've been
[33:35] made hyperconquerors.
[33:38] Right? That's what that that's almost a
[33:41] direct literal translation is a
[33:43] hyperconqueror. Not that you're going to
[33:45] through Christ through Christ and the
[33:47] surrender to Christ in his word, you
[33:50] will not just overcome the flesh by a
[33:52] little bit, but you will have like 25
[33:56] times conquered the flesh, right? Total
[33:59] absolute victory that when you it's not
[34:01] you're not going to come to like a
[34:03] negotiated peace with the devil, right?
[34:05] When you conquer the flesh and you
[34:06] conquer this day and age, you're not
[34:08] going to come to a negotiated peace
[34:10] where he's got a little and you got a
[34:12] little and we're going to come together
[34:13] and have a peace agreement and have some
[34:14] sort of daunt de demilitarized zone. No,
[34:17] we're talking total extermination of the
[34:19] enemy, hyper conquest.
[34:22] Anyways, we're out of time.
[34:25] Let's uh have a word of prayer. Father,
[34:28] we thank you for this for this morning
[34:30] that we have um that you've given us
[34:33] that Lord, we thank you for the promises
[34:36] in your word. Ask that you would be with
[34:37] us the remainder of the service. Be with
[34:38] us in the song service. Lord, let us let
[34:41] your spirit move. Let us open our hearts
[34:43] to you and give you praise. Be pleased
[34:45] to dwell with us. We ask these things in
[34:46] Jesus name. Amen.
