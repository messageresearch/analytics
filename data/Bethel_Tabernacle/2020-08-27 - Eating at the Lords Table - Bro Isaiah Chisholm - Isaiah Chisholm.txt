from lower uh lenoir north carolina and covert 19 had struck that church about 80 percent it got so bad until they had to spray the whole entire church well that particular sunday we was ministering there and the lord was really moving in a mighty way i still believe that god's still a healer i told the church the same lord jesus that was with william branham william branham has gone into that dimension but the holy spirit is still here but you got to get the people to believe not even cancer so he was preaching on that level and there was a sister that she couldn't breathe the type of the cover 19. and she said as i was ministering and when i walked on the floor she said her whole body began to shook and she said god healed her right then and there and there's another sister came up because i was telling the story about brother elvin's car you know this story brother browner told in 1962 brother elvin's call was stolen how brother browner prayed and he used matthew the 18th chapter and 19th verse that there's two of you will gather together and agree brother brown used that and her vision came for and brother elvin's call was restored but this sister came up she's a brother children there's many things has been said and she said one thing in particular watch now what is your need tonight but this social came up and said a friend of hers campbell was stolen she said now i'm trusting god i said my my god sister i said well i believe god too i said do you believe we're going to touch and agree she said yeah i said well it's going to happen i say i don't know when but that camper is going to be restored do you believe it myself she said yes we join hand just a simple prayer she walked away and a few days after that uh uh my wife was just flipping through her phone and she saw on youtube or however she saw on her phone uh there was a camper that has been stolen so my wife called me and when i looked at it i saw my goodness we're gonna have a revival so
