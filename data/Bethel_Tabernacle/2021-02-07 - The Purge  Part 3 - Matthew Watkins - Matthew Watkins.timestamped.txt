[3:41] if you have your bible this morning amen
[3:45] daniel chapter nine
[3:52] the pre-service music still playing guys
[3:54] if you all wanna
[3:55] kill that amen you love him this morning
[3:59] daniel chapter 9 and we just want to
[4:04] begin reading here at verse 27
[4:07] amen verse 27 daniel chapter 9 verse 27
[4:11] and he shall confirm the covenant for
[4:13] many for
[4:14] one week and in the midst of the week
[4:17] he shall cause the sacrifice and
[4:19] oblation to cease
[4:21] and for the over spreading of
[4:23] abominations
[4:24] he shall make it desolate even until the
[4:27] consummation
[4:29] and that determined shall be poured
[4:32] upon the desolate matthew chapter 24
[4:35] just one more scripture and i'll have
[4:37] you be seated
[4:38] i want to reference where jesus
[4:39] references daniel 9
[4:42] matthew chapter 24 and one verse verse
[4:44] 15
[4:50] when you therefore shall see the
[4:52] abomination of desolation
[4:54] spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in
[4:57] the holy place
[4:58] who so readeth let him understand you
[5:01] can be seated this morning
[5:03] i'd like to continue on with the topic
[5:06] we've had
[5:06] we've titled the purge i think this is i
[5:09] forget what part it would
[5:10] it is you'd have to look at it and i'd
[5:12] like to come to some of what the prophet
[5:15] of god says and brothers i did send you
[5:17] you will have to go back and find it
[5:19] it's i didn't send it today but it's the
[5:21] covenant should be called the covenant
[5:22] broken
[5:24] it's a document you could just display
[5:26] that whenever you get that up that's
[5:27] fine
[5:28] i'd like to to us to go into some of the
[5:31] things that we've been going through
[5:33] things that the prophet said about
[5:35] tribulation and about the end time
[5:37] and i believe it's a good topic right
[5:39] now to discuss on a lot of people's
[5:40] minds
[5:41] and so i'd like to just look at this
[5:43] maybe fresh one time
[5:45] as i heard it said to me
[5:49] that this covenant that is spoken of the
[5:51] book of daniel
[5:53] has already passed us and that we are
[5:55] the same brother believe that we are
[5:57] uh currently in the tribulation right
[5:59] now and that it's already taken place
[6:00] and so
[6:01] um it's shocking that some people can
[6:03] believe that but
[6:04] you know you're you're you all of us we
[6:07] would we would
[6:08] look at something like that and maybe
[6:10] ridicule it and think how could someone
[6:11] believe that well don't forget you're
[6:12] we're all susceptible to believe things
[6:14] that aren't true
[6:16] and we're all susceptible for our mind
[6:18] uh to to go off and
[6:20] down rabbit trails that god never
[6:22] intended us
[6:23] intended for us to uh romans 9 chapter
[6:27] romans chapter 9 verse 27 if you want to
[6:30] hold that in your bible just keep that
[6:32] open there
[6:33] so it's spoken he says and he shall
[6:35] confirm do you have did you did you guys
[6:37] find that
[6:37] good if you want to display that and
[6:39] just bring it over that'd be good
[6:41] i want you to read what brother branham
[6:42] says here
[6:44] when you ask that question you know when
[6:47] we speak
[6:48] of and you've heard it i'm sure many
[6:49] times mentioned
[6:51] the covenant that's going to be broken
[6:53] uh you know between the catholic church
[6:55] and the jews and we've it's been
[6:58] discussed over
[6:59] coffee and many times in in in
[7:01] fellowship settings and even over the
[7:03] pulpit
[7:04] and so let's just bring some clarity to
[7:06] it here this morning so that you can
[7:08] uh have something that that you are
[7:10] established upon
[7:11] truth so we put up first what is it and
[7:15] we read the scripture there in daniel 9
[7:17] and he shall confirm the covenant i have
[7:19] highlighted in green
[7:20] the important pertinent things that
[7:22] would connect to other verses
[7:24] in the bible and so he says he shall
[7:26] confirm the covenant for
[7:28] with uh with many for one week and in
[7:31] the midst of the week the middle of the
[7:32] week calls the sacrifice and oblation to
[7:34] cease
[7:34] over spreading of abominations he shall
[7:36] make it desolate so
[7:38] what is this covenant notice what
[7:41] brother branham says here
[7:42] he says notice and i hope you could see
[7:44] that in the blue there
[7:46] yep notice in the last one
[7:49] half of daniel's week the people
[7:52] makes a covenant this prince makes a
[7:55] covenant with rome
[7:57] makes a covenant with them no doubt for
[8:00] the wealth
[8:01] for catholic and jews hold the wealth of
[8:04] the world that's in
[8:05] 63 in the first seal a few sentences
[8:08] later brother branham says this
[8:10] and after the church is taken away
[8:13] rome and the jews will make a covenant
[8:16] with one another
[8:17] the bible said that they would with the
[8:20] holy people
[8:21] and now notice they'll make it because
[8:24] why
[8:25] this nation is going to be busted
[8:28] and the rest of the world that's on the
[8:30] gold standard is busted you know that
[8:33] if we are living off the taxes due bills
[8:35] for 40 years from now
[8:37] he says if we are living all the taxes
[8:39] due bills for 40
[8:40] years from now where are we at there is
[8:43] only one thing can happen
[8:45] that's to call in the currency and pay
[8:47] off the bonds and we can't do it
[8:49] wall street owns them and wall street is
[8:52] controlled by the jews the rest of it
[8:54] is in the vatican and the jews has got
[8:57] the rest of it in wall street with the
[8:59] commerce of the world
[9:01] we can't call it in now i want you to
[9:04] remember as you're reading these
[9:05] read the first go scroll back up i'm
[9:07] sorry uh
[9:09] down to the keep going down down down
[9:11] this one right there
[9:12] notice the first words and after the
[9:15] church
[9:16] is taken and after the church
[9:20] is taken so we have to remember context
[9:25] is key
[9:26] timeline is really key because when does
[9:29] this take place
[9:30] after the church is taken does that mean
[9:34] there's things that can lead up that you
[9:35] start to see a foreshadowing of it
[9:37] absolutely you can but to assert that
[9:40] it's already taken place
[9:42] then then we have missed the coming of
[9:43] the lord because this happens after the
[9:45] church is taken you're following
[9:47] he says and then there's only one thing
[9:49] to do the catholic church
[9:52] let me make sure this is where i want to
[9:53] read yes and
[9:55] he says and then there's only one thing
[9:58] to do the catholic church can pay it off
[10:00] she's the only one who's got the money
[10:02] and she can do it and she will do it and
[10:05] in doing this
[10:06] to get it she'll compromise with the
[10:08] jews to make a covenant
[10:10] and when she makes this covenant with
[10:12] the jews now remember i'm taking this
[10:14] from the scripture
[10:15] and now when she does this and makes
[10:18] this covenant we notice in daniel 8 23
[10:21] and 25
[10:22] he will cause craft to prosper and craft
[10:25] is manufacturing in his hand and he
[10:28] makes this covenant with the jews and in
[10:30] the midst
[10:31] of this three and a half years he breaks
[10:33] his covenant
[10:34] as soon as he gets the thing wrapped up
[10:37] and gets the money
[10:38] of the jews tied up and when he does
[10:40] that oh my
[10:42] oh my so i want to just point out here
[10:45] when you have this and you can get these
[10:47] this document from me i want to say also
[10:49] to those on the internet those who have
[10:50] emailed those in this church
[10:52] have asked me for a document i apologize
[10:55] i haven't sent it
[10:56] the reason is intentional um myself and
[10:59] brother jason amar's i haven't
[11:00] contributed yet
[11:01] uh to it but are working on an article
[11:04] that covers this entire
[11:06] topic of tribulation uh for the elected
[11:10] before the rapture and
[11:11] is there going to be persecution and
[11:13] tribulation and so we're authoring that
[11:15] now so i don't want to i don't want to
[11:17] send out anything until we have that
[11:18] done and then you have that
[11:20] final document there's been people quite
[11:22] a few have asked me for that
[11:24] so i just want to say when you have
[11:26] these uh scroll up if you could
[11:28] scroll up yep keep it right there so
[11:30] when you have these
[11:32] uh these comments that are so direct
[11:34] there is
[11:35] no absolutely no need for
[11:38] speculation right none amen
[11:42] now we like to speculate what if over
[11:44] coffee you know what about what brother
[11:46] brandon said here
[11:47] this is there's no need to speculate you
[11:49] have it right here directly the prophet
[11:52] of god saying this happens
[11:53] after the church is gone
[11:56] there's no room for speculation i want
[11:59] to make that emphatic you may say yeah
[12:01] brother matt we get the point but you
[12:02] you won't believe how many people don't
[12:04] get the point
[12:06] there's no room there's no need the
[12:09] bride
[12:10] brother branham said will already be
[12:12] gone not just spiritually
[12:14] physically she'll be out of here amen
[12:17] and so
[12:17] listen to what brother branham says
[12:19] about it this is so direct
[12:21] i don't this is this brother adam leaves
[12:22] no wiggle room here go down to the next
[12:24] quote
[12:25] and this prince in that time is to make
[12:28] a covenant with daniel's people
[12:30] which is the jews that's when the bride
[12:33] is taken
[12:34] out now she won't see it
[12:39] not only will she not experience it she
[12:41] won't even see it in other words we
[12:43] won't be here to watch this take place
[12:46] will we be here to see california i
[12:47] don't know will we be here to see this
[12:49] we've asked those questions many times
[12:50] here's what we could say about this we
[12:52] won't see it
[12:53] right so you say brother matt when does
[12:56] this
[12:57] covenant take place let's scroll down
[12:59] jeremiah 30 verse 7
[13:01] alas for that day is great so that none
[13:04] is like it
[13:06] it is even the time of jacob's trouble
[13:08] but he shall be saved out of it read the
[13:10] verse again
[13:11] it's very important for that day is
[13:13] great so that none
[13:14] is like it it is even the time of
[13:16] jacob's trouble but he
[13:19] shall be saved out of it listen to what
[13:22] matthew chapter 24 now
[13:23] listen what he says here for then shall
[13:25] be great tribulation
[13:27] such as was not since the beginning of
[13:30] the world to this time no
[13:32] nor ever shall be that's the words of
[13:34] jesus referencing jeremiah 30
[13:37] jacob's trouble amen he says the last of
[13:40] the day is great so that none is like it
[13:42] jesus picks it up in matthew 24
[13:44] this is great tribulation such as not
[13:47] such as was not since the beginning of
[13:48] the world of this time no no no
[13:50] shall ever be so what's very evident
[13:53] when you read this
[13:54] that this takes place during
[13:57] jacob's trouble which is the great
[14:00] tribulation period this takes place
[14:02] during that time not before
[14:05] not after but during that time
[14:09] and so there's let me say this there's
[14:11] no salvation during this time
[14:14] there's none no no way to get saved at
[14:16] this point
[14:17] notice what he says here but he in verse
[14:19] in verse
[14:20] 7 he shall be saved out of it who is he
[14:24] not you not me
[14:28] he shall be saved jacob
[14:31] this is who he's pointing to jacob shall
[14:34] be saved out of it
[14:36] the jews will be saved out of it but we
[14:39] won't be here
[14:41] salvation at this point at this place
[14:44] that jesus is prophesying
[14:46] speaking of is already over for the
[14:48] gentile dispensation
[14:50] is finished and so you say brother matt
[14:54] what is the gentile dispensation that's
[14:56] what's happening right now
[14:58] that's what's been happening since the
[14:59] book of acts
[15:01] until the the fullness of the gentiles
[15:04] be come in what is the church ages it's
[15:06] the fullness of the gentiles
[15:09] that's why people who say we are out of
[15:11] the seventh church age don't realize
[15:12] they are saying we are
[15:14] out of the gentile dispensation
[15:17] because the seven church ages are the
[15:19] the gentile dispensation
[15:21] amen but he shall be saved out of it the
[15:24] he
[15:25] is jacob israel the bride
[15:28] the elected is clearly clearly
[15:32] not here during this time because why we
[15:34] have a type of joseph
[15:36] before he reveals himself to his
[15:39] brethren he
[15:40] he dismisses his his wife away he
[15:43] in fact the bible says he says let no
[15:45] man be in the room
[15:46] dismiss everybody so there's no one
[15:49] that's
[15:49] there that's pertinent to the story
[15:52] except
[15:53] his his brethren are you following that
[15:55] this morning
[15:56] genesis 45 verse 45 you can scroll i got
[15:59] it there
[15:59] then joseph could not refrain himself
[16:01] before all them that stood by him
[16:04] and he cried calls every man to go out
[16:07] from me
[16:08] and there stood no man with him while
[16:10] joseph made himself
[16:11] known unto his brethren
[16:15] if you're here you've missed the rapture
[16:18] if you're here then
[16:20] you've missed the rapture because there
[16:22] is no more rap there is no
[16:23] the catch in a way has already happened
[16:25] for god's family so it's clear that this
[16:27] happens
[16:28] after the fullness of the gentiles
[16:30] otherwise known as the church ages
[16:32] i want to staple that in your minds
[16:34] because that's important when you study
[16:36] the church ages otherwise known as the
[16:38] fullness of the gentiles
[16:40] remember that the fullness of the
[16:42] gentiles otherwise known as the church
[16:44] ages
[16:45] because that's what it's speaking of
[16:46] when you read in your bible until the
[16:48] fullness of the gentiles be come in
[16:50] notice what brother branham says here in
[16:51] the in the church age book the ephesian
[16:53] church age
[16:54] thus scroll down guys
[16:57] scroll down uh uh go up go up i didn't
[17:00] know i had romans good there it is
[17:02] for i would not brethren that you should
[17:03] be ignorant of this mystery lest you
[17:05] should be wise in your own conceits
[17:06] that blindness in part is happened to
[17:09] israel
[17:10] until until junction
[17:13] until the blindness when will the jews
[17:16] eyes be open will we see that no we'll
[17:18] be out of here we'll be gone
[17:21] until the fullness of the gentiles be
[17:25] come in there's your stopping point
[17:29] thus the whole of the church is brother
[17:30] branham in the ephesian church thus the
[17:32] whole of the church ages is god the
[17:34] whole of it
[17:35] is god dealing with the gentiles and
[17:37] calling out a gentile bride to himself
[17:40] that makes the church ages and the
[17:42] fullness of the gentiles the one
[17:45] and the same thing wow
[17:49] exact same thing
[17:54] so what you can see uh and i think i
[17:57] have the chart there this is the chart
[17:59] and you can uh there it is there so what
[18:02] you can see
[18:03] very clearly from this chart draw my
[18:05] brother branham himself he draws this
[18:07] chart
[18:08] himself when he teaches daniel 70 weeks
[18:10] you can get a hold of this picture it's
[18:12] really good
[18:12] if you have it blown up and high-res and
[18:14] you can see it and so remember brother
[18:16] adam asked the lord before he preaches
[18:18] the
[18:19] daniel 70 weeks the brother branham
[18:21] asked the lord
[18:23] to guide him and he said i don't want to
[18:25] make a mistake you know hold
[18:26] guide me even when he drew this chart uh
[18:29] brother branham is going to preach this
[18:30] and the holy spirit gives him this
[18:32] inspiration to draw this
[18:34] before he preaches daniel 70 weeks and
[18:36] we're not really getting into daniel 70
[18:37] weeks here this morning
[18:39] but notice what he says here the moment
[18:42] he starts the 70th week
[18:45] or seven years each week representing
[18:47] seven years
[18:48] the church is gone uh you have the chart
[18:51] you should have the quote above that
[18:52] maybe gideon
[18:53] yeah scroll zoom in right there to that
[18:56] so that they can see it real well
[18:57] the moment he starts the 70th week or
[19:01] seven years the church is gone
[19:05] now listen i'm quoting again recording
[19:07] so you won't forget
[19:09] this is what the holy spirit put upon
[19:12] my pen while i was writing
[19:15] and scroll down just so you can see that
[19:18] uh zoom in and scroll into that chart
[19:19] just for a minute
[19:22] so the bride isn't here during this time
[19:24] that's that's what's clear you can you
[19:25] zoom and blow that up blow it up blow it
[19:27] up more
[19:28] right there so can you see that real
[19:30] well notice how
[19:31] how you have at the top the raptured
[19:33] saints scroll down just a little bit
[19:35] getting more to the middle
[19:36] you have the seven church ages right
[19:38] there and then brother branham has lines
[19:40] put
[19:41] stopping points so they
[19:44] really you know i'll just say this with
[19:46] all due respect
[19:47] a lot of the speculation is just a lack
[19:50] of study
[19:52] a lot of the speculation people has just
[19:54] a lack of doing the harder work of going
[19:57] back and digging up and finding out for
[19:59] yourself what did the bible say
[20:01] and what did god's prophet give us
[20:02] clarity on that
[20:04] and when you don't do that and you take
[20:06] brother said and this sister said and
[20:08] this man said and i heard this preacher
[20:10] say
[20:11] you're going to end up in a either i
[20:13] don't i don't really know
[20:14] or sometimes we have fear and we stay
[20:15] away from these subjects because it's
[20:17] too complicated it's really not it's
[20:20] really not
[20:22] so it's clear brother and listen to what
[20:23] he says here you say the church has to
[20:25] go through the persecution we've read
[20:26] this many times a man who chooses a wife
[20:28] i have this down below
[20:29] a man who chooses wife don't put her
[20:30] through a lot of punishment he's already
[20:32] found grace to her
[20:33] has found grace with him so
[20:36] he says here in questions and answers
[20:38] let me rush through this real quick
[20:40] now in the last part the 70th week the
[20:42] last part of it will be during the time
[20:44] of tribulation period
[20:46] so it's clear that this happens during
[20:48] when is this covenant broken
[20:50] when does the when does the breaking of
[20:51] the covenant happen it's clear it
[20:53] happens during
[20:54] the 70th week of daniel which is the
[20:56] last week
[20:58] uh in and it's in the middle of the week
[21:00] he says now in the last part the 70th
[21:02] week the last part of it will be during
[21:04] the time of
[21:05] the tribulation period after big word
[21:08] after the rapture of the church
[21:12] then here is the three and a half years
[21:14] here that it will be confirmed to them
[21:16] again by the prophets see moses and
[21:18] elijah revelations chapter 11.
[21:20] so daniel 9 verse 27 we ran that
[21:24] we we read that earlier uh daniel 9 27
[21:29] it's it's a reference and referring
[21:31] directly
[21:33] to a prince but not the messiah prince
[21:36] daniel 8 refers to the messiah prince
[21:39] this prince is the roman prince the
[21:42] the the catholic church so daniel 9 27
[21:46] is referring directly to the prince from
[21:48] rome
[21:49] not the messiah prince he is the
[21:51] antichrist
[21:52] he's not christ he's the antichrist he's
[21:56] the opposite
[21:57] so the seven year covenant that the
[21:59] bible talks about
[22:00] is is the covenant the deal no matter if
[22:03] you want to read what brother adam talks
[22:04] about he talks about that deal brother
[22:06] matt
[22:06] talks about that agreement and that deal
[22:08] this is the self and same thing the
[22:10] covenant the deal the agreement the
[22:11] arrangement
[22:13] you say when is that i'm watching for
[22:15] that to take place then you're watching
[22:16] to miss the rapture
[22:19] because you won't see it take place
[22:20] could you see the leading up of that you
[22:22] absolutely can
[22:24] um and so in the first half of this 70th
[22:27] week
[22:28] the first half of that last week two
[22:31] prophets
[22:32] have a ministry right amen
[22:35] everybody going to get a pulse check
[22:36] here amen
[22:39] so during that last half of that 70th
[22:42] week
[22:42] two prophets have their ministry you'll
[22:44] find that in revelations chapter 11
[22:46] and in the second half after that
[22:48] covenant is broken
[22:50] the antichrist will reign for 42 months
[22:54] and and and that's in revelations 13 if
[22:57] you want to if you want to read about
[22:59] that
[22:59] so during that time uh of persecution
[23:03] when the antichrist is reigning
[23:05] there will be martyrs jewish martyrs not
[23:07] christian martyrs not believers
[23:09] but jewish martyrs who will have to give
[23:12] their life
[23:13] uh to seal their testimony and as a
[23:16] fulfillment of the second part of the
[23:19] even what brother adam
[23:20] refers to if you go and study the fifth
[23:22] seal and so
[23:23] brother branham says this in the 70th
[23:25] week of daniel well god did with the
[23:27] well god did with the jews just exactly
[23:30] what he said he would do in them
[23:32] 69 years it was 483 years but 69 weeks
[23:37] and
[23:37] one week left one week is yet
[23:40] determined gabriel's instructions to
[23:43] daniel and the antichrist will make a
[23:45] covenant for them
[23:46] last seven weeks and in the middle of it
[23:50] in the midst of it he'll break that
[23:52] covenant turn them into catholicism
[23:55] the abomination will spread over the
[23:57] whole thing like that and
[23:58] then the end shall be the end of all in
[24:01] of all time
[24:02] and so brother madam carries that same
[24:03] exact thought
[24:05] in the fifth seal and you're going to
[24:07] see this right here also now watch
[24:10] they have to be martyred by the
[24:11] antichrist we just come through and
[24:14] notice in his last ride where he breaks
[24:15] his covenant when he breaks that
[24:17] covenant with them jews down there and
[24:18] there she's
[24:19] gone now we have a lot more i'm not
[24:22] going to read this last quote just to
[24:23] save time
[24:25] but what's very clear to me when you
[24:27] read this
[24:28] is that this has not
[24:32] happened yet this
[24:35] has not happened yet in any way in any
[24:38] shape in any form
[24:40] you say how do you know that brother
[24:42] matt because salvation is still
[24:44] here mercy is
[24:47] still here the holy ghost
[24:50] is still here are you glad for that
[24:54] it's mercy i love how brother tim pruitt
[24:56] says it is mercy over
[24:57] mercy no mercy no mercy's still here
[25:02] it's amazing and i'll just take my last
[25:04] five minutes here just to say this
[25:06] it's amazing how quickly if we're not
[25:09] careful i'm gonna need more than five
[25:10] minutes but i'm the song leader today so
[25:12] just
[25:13] give me grace just for a couple minutes
[25:15] um
[25:17] it's amazing because conspiracy and you
[25:20] you've
[25:20] you we live in such an age you can mute
[25:23] that we live in such an age of
[25:24] conspiracy
[25:25] and you know you've talked to i'm sure
[25:28] you know you've had someone even me
[25:30] myself have looked at things and someone
[25:31] has sent you something in an email or
[25:33] document or text and you've got to watch
[25:35] this and
[25:36] you know you've got to see this and all
[25:37] the proofs out there and they give you
[25:38] all the links to all the
[25:40] websites that it that proves the
[25:42] conspiracy
[25:43] and uh and you know conspiracy theories
[25:45] let me let me just say
[25:47] have have been around forever been
[25:49] around forever it's not the inner the
[25:51] age of the internet has exasperated them
[25:54] uh but they've been around for for
[25:56] millennia for ages conspiracy has
[25:58] in fact conspiracy is very real the
[26:01] theory is that you believe
[26:02] something that you can't prove
[26:04] necessarily but you
[26:06] connect dots and so conspiracy
[26:10] theories have been given have been put
[26:12] on steroids
[26:13] especially in this generation of
[26:16] research and
[26:17] google and google has helped that with
[26:19] their own algorithms
[26:21] if you watch a very good documentary
[26:23] that brother jason demar sent me called
[26:25] the social dilemma
[26:26] and if you haven't seen that i'd
[26:28] recommend it it's really good
[26:30] watch with your teenagers and your
[26:31] children especially but it talks about
[26:34] the engineering and how
[26:35] the algorithms specifically find what
[26:38] you believe you believe in the world
[26:40] trade center was an inside job
[26:42] they're going to give you everything
[26:43] they possibly can and results and
[26:45] advertisements to
[26:46] cultivate that not to disprove it but to
[26:48] cultivate it because they know that
[26:50] that's how you
[26:51] what you want to see so it's curating
[26:54] your news based upon
[26:55] algorithms of things that it thinks you
[26:58] want to read or want to
[27:00] uh want to study out and so
[27:03] there was a book a really good book i
[27:05] was studying actually this just this
[27:07] morning
[27:07] really good book called the death of
[27:10] expertise it's by a man
[27:12] an author named tom nichols and i'm just
[27:14] going to read a
[27:15] paragraph that he says he says
[27:17] conspiracy theories
[27:19] are a way for people to give context and
[27:22] meaning
[27:22] to events that frighten them without a
[27:26] coherent explanation for why terrible
[27:28] things happen to innocent people
[27:31] they would have to accept such
[27:33] occurrences as nothing more
[27:35] than the random cruelty either of an
[27:38] uncaring universe
[27:39] or an incomprehensible deity
[27:42] for many piecing together threads to
[27:44] form a narrative of blame
[27:47] brings a measure of comfort a place to
[27:49] locate
[27:50] our rage or find some kind of grand
[27:53] purpose
[27:54] even if nefarious for the brokenness
[27:58] of our world and so often times
[28:01] i've i've seen and you watch even things
[28:04] that brother branham said
[28:06] and things about i'm not gonna go into
[28:08] specific topics
[28:10] but we were if we're not careful we're
[28:13] more prone to this probably than anybody
[28:16] to believe there's some greater evil
[28:18] taking place
[28:19] and you say brother matt why is that
[28:20] because the world is evil
[28:23] and because there is a lot of evil that
[28:25] takes place
[28:26] and there is a lot of conspiracy
[28:28] theories that have proven out to be true
[28:30] and the bible is filled with conspiracy
[28:32] theories david cons had a conspiracy to
[28:34] kill a a woman's husband who he had had
[28:37] adultery with
[28:39] and so uh we we we can see this that
[28:42] there's evil in all humanity
[28:44] we know that and so we we look down
[28:47] and you say brother matt why is it why
[28:49] why is why why are people so susceptible
[28:52] to it one of the reasons
[28:53] is because conspiracy is
[28:57] we live in a world where it's possible
[28:59] where it's highly possible
[29:01] uh and and so there's many many
[29:04] way more conspiracy theories that have
[29:07] been debunked
[29:08] and disproven than have been true that's
[29:11] a fact there's
[29:12] been way more and there's been some very
[29:14] violent and destructive you say
[29:16] conspiracy theories are harmless that's
[29:18] not true go read the news
[29:20] go look at pizzagate
[29:23] where people almost got killed i don't
[29:25] think anyone died in that
[29:26] but where people almost got killed
[29:28] because of a conspiracy that someone had
[29:31] put out there on the news
[29:33] um about a about something with hillary
[29:35] clinton we won't even give it credit
[29:37] here today but
[29:38] they've been and so the the world
[29:41] uh the world the the world that we live
[29:44] in conspiracy
[29:46] is possible we re we just mentioned that
[29:50] that corruption and cover-ups
[29:53] are possible and probable in the world
[29:56] that we live in
[29:57] jesus was the re was was in the midst of
[30:01] a conspiracy to kill him
[30:04] to take up a murder plot against him so
[30:06] we know that that
[30:07] mischief and corruption and evil and
[30:10] secret plots of evil are very real
[30:12] but you notice that even today in our
[30:15] generation that we live
[30:17] all new there's been a total lack of
[30:19] trust
[30:20] and a complete loss of trust in
[30:23] in anything you read in the media from
[30:25] news and it doesn't matter what outlet
[30:27] it is
[30:27] and a lot of it is merited because news
[30:30] has been
[30:31] uh has been so tainted by the left
[30:34] liberal media that you almost don't
[30:36] believe anything
[30:38] and you say why are christians more
[30:39] susceptible to look at conspiracy
[30:41] because a lot of the left-leaning media
[30:43] has
[30:43] specifically targeted christians
[30:48] right come on this ain't taboo to talk
[30:50] about here today
[30:51] it's amongst all of us they've they've
[30:54] targeted
[30:54] uh christians and so if anybody's gonna
[30:57] be a little bit more susceptible to
[30:59] look into things and believe things um
[31:02] it would be
[31:03] it would be christians it's the all
[31:05] information there's a complete lack of
[31:07] trust
[31:08] and we've had political leaders that
[31:10] have been exposed for conspiracy and
[31:13] exposed for corruption
[31:14] constantly we have no lack all of our
[31:17] institutions
[31:18] that we have that we had trust in one
[31:20] day we've lost all trust in them and
[31:22] it's because of evil
[31:23] and corruption and i'm not protecting
[31:26] i'm not defending it i'm not saying you
[31:28] should have
[31:28] faith in it i don't have any faith in it
[31:30] whatsoever
[31:32] because i know that it's the it's the uh
[31:35] the
[31:35] it's the entire world the bible says has
[31:37] drank of her cup of
[31:39] of fornication and so there is no good
[31:42] outlet there is no uh balanced and fair
[31:45] media as they say there is no such a
[31:47] thing
[31:48] and so it's amazing because i was
[31:50] reading just
[31:51] some comments from this individual he
[31:53] was saying he said when i was a kid
[31:55] news basically claimed came in three
[31:57] forms curated every morning in our three
[31:59] chicago newspapers at night from anchors
[32:02] with with the big three news networks
[32:05] and news radio stations
[32:07] and if you wanted to find information
[32:08] about a specific person or place or
[32:10] thing
[32:11] you throw thumb through your copy of the
[32:13] official encyclopedia britannica
[32:16] or you drive to the library and look
[32:18] through periodicals
[32:19] on microfilm today we seek our own
[32:22] experts we can read the first few
[32:25] results in google which probably were
[32:27] paid
[32:28] advertisement yeah because the first few
[32:31] spots of google
[32:32] are paid not organic search they are
[32:35] paid search they are
[32:36] paid to give you when you type something
[32:38] to give them this first above
[32:40] everything else whether you realize that
[32:42] or not that's a fact
[32:44] and so we we let me just keep reading
[32:47] here which probably ended up so he says
[32:49] or scan articles posted by others on
[32:51] social media
[32:52] or rely on email newsletters or podcasts
[32:57] and so you know uh there was a senator
[33:00] famous
[33:00] senator senator ben sasse who speaks of
[33:03] this and
[33:04] he talks about just how corrosive of an
[33:06] impact
[33:07] this distrust has caused in the world
[33:10] and he says in the process we've
[33:13] obliterated the gatekeepers who helped
[33:15] to ensure that
[33:16] information was important and reliable
[33:19] we've erased the distinction between
[33:22] news
[33:24] and opinion my goodness that's
[33:27] absolutely the truth
[33:29] and we're losing the habits that could
[33:31] help us make
[33:32] calm considered decisions when it comes
[33:36] to consuming
[33:37] news were miles wide and an
[33:40] inch deep that was ben sasse really
[33:44] really good and so there's also as we
[33:48] said there's this
[33:49] constant uh you know and and if you're
[33:52] not
[33:52] careful conspiracy theory
[33:56] appeal to your own pride
[33:59] they appeal to your own human fallen
[34:01] pride because there's a pride within
[34:04] all of us that want to know everything
[34:06] or want to believe
[34:08] uh that we know everything and we have
[34:10] every answer and every question and we
[34:11] have all the information when we don't
[34:13] it's clear we don't
[34:14] right i don't think sometimes we're
[34:16] intellectually honest about our own
[34:18] intellectual deficiencies
[34:22] yeah we're not some people be honest
[34:25] with ourselves we don't have the
[34:26] humility to admit it sometimes that
[34:28] we're not experts in everything
[34:31] we're not i'm not i'm an expert in my
[34:34] field
[34:34] that i've tried to be as much of an
[34:36] expert as i possibly can to be a
[34:37] professional
[34:38] but there are certain things i would
[34:39] never pretend to tell a doctor
[34:41] who studied for years at a college and
[34:44] who has degrees in medicine
[34:46] and who has diagnosed patients and
[34:48] looked at cases after case after case
[34:50] it would be arrogant of me to suggest
[34:52] that i through a google search
[34:54] can now know more than he does about
[34:57] about that disease or that
[34:59] problem in my health does that mean that
[35:01] google hasn't helped a lot of
[35:03] people and no i'm not suggesting that at
[35:05] all but sometimes we need to be more
[35:06] intellectually honest
[35:09] and so conspiracy theories
[35:12] they appeal to vanity to pride
[35:15] and uh everyone's just got to be in the
[35:18] know and everyone wants to be in control
[35:21] and we want to have this the the answers
[35:24] the secrets that everybody
[35:25] you know wants and so we know what
[35:27] happened to to this
[35:29] you know to 9 11. we know what happened
[35:31] over here and you could name conspiracy
[35:32] after the
[35:33] conspiracy after conspiracy and
[35:36] and so what's amazing you say brother
[35:39] matt why is this important because i
[35:40] believe
[35:41] as a believer we live in what's true
[35:46] not what could be true not what's
[35:49] possibly true we live in what's true
[35:53] listen to philippians 4 8. the bible
[35:56] says
[35:56] paul says whatsoever is true and
[35:59] whatever is
[36:00] honorable think on these things
[36:04] you know what people when they come to
[36:05] me with a conspiracy theory and they
[36:07] oh did you see this and you watch this
[36:09] video and you watch how they pieced it
[36:10] all together here and all they've
[36:11] connected all the dots
[36:12] i just go yeah i mean
[36:16] maybe i don't know maybe and you know
[36:20] what after that moment i probably will
[36:22] never process that again in my mind amen
[36:25] but some people can become consumed by
[36:28] that
[36:28] believers can become consumed where it's
[36:31] all they look at and all they study and
[36:33] all they talk about is the next
[36:34] conspiracy taking place
[36:36] let me just give you what paul said
[36:38] whatsoever things are
[36:40] true there's a reason he said that what
[36:43] so
[36:43] there's a reason why paul said also uh
[36:46] and i'm trying to think of the word
[36:48] myths and fables
[36:50] and he says don't even give ear to
[36:52] endless genealogies and
[36:54] and myths and fables could there be a
[36:56] truth to them there could be but don't
[36:58] give your time to that
[37:00] it's corrosive to your mind it's
[37:02] corrosive to your own faith
[37:04] some of the most conspiratory people
[37:06] i've ever met are some of the most
[37:08] faithless people because conspiracy
[37:11] leads to a degradation of faith in
[37:14] anything wow
[37:17] and you don't you just get to the point
[37:19] to where you start questioning
[37:20] everything in your reality that's
[37:22] happened around you
[37:23] and even some uh you know who
[37:26] and sad it's really sad and i feel sorry
[37:29] for them some people who get in
[37:30] you know fantastical uh stories of of
[37:33] these
[37:34] you know conspiracy the and things that
[37:36] have happened that's it yes first
[37:37] timothy i had it
[37:38] here first timothy 1 4 talks about silly
[37:40] myths or fables
[37:42] uh in first timothy 1 4. if you want to
[37:44] write that down
[37:45] and so i read a a ed stezzer who's a
[37:49] professor
[37:50] at wheaton college and he has a they
[37:51] have a magazine called christian in the
[37:53] day
[37:53] he says when you share such fake news
[37:56] and conspiracy theories you are
[37:58] simply bearing false witness this
[38:01] is a sin and it's time to repent
[38:05] pretty strong and so you say brother
[38:07] matt what do we need
[38:08] we as believers more than anybody need
[38:11] wisdom
[38:12] we need wisdom over the information that
[38:15] we take in and we give out
[38:17] we don't have any time we really are
[38:19] over time i apologize let's stand to our
[38:20] feet
[38:21] i didn't really get get get time to do
[38:24] that justice
[38:25] and then maybe the next time we'll pick
[38:27] that up let's bow our heads lord
[38:29] thank you father for your word it's
[38:31] truths
[38:32] lord it's truth lord that we can hold on
[38:35] to that we could
[38:36] that can stabilize our lives lord in an
[38:38] unstable world
[38:40] we pray father that you would anchor it
[38:41] down into our hearts lord may you be in
[38:43] the
[38:44] worship the music the singing the
[38:45] ministering of your word
[38:47] we ask you to bless us now this morning
[38:49] in jesus name amen
