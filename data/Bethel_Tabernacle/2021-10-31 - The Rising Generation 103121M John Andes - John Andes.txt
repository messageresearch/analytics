TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as i was as i was driving this morning an inspiration struck me almost wish i could preach it today but you know during um world war ii which was actually the second woe in the book of revelation had to come world thought that they think they know what that's about it was it was only about god getting israel back into their homeland and preparing them for messiah but one of the things that was notable when i started thinking about all everything that we overcame as a team and i'm not going to go down the list today but just trust me the list is long and there were a number of impossible situations that i just didn't see how it could be done and yet in ways i cannot explain to you if you needed me to i couldn't explain that certain things happen and they just happened and i don't even know how they happened but they happened and it went off and here we are and i thought about how that during world war ii and the allied and axis powers clashing and you know it's it's it's notable in history the invasion of normandy uh when the allied forces under dwight eisenhower stormed the beaches at omaha and utah and sword and the different beaches and the axis powers were dug in and i mean they were dug in and they they had almost every kind of weapon imaginable to stop the allied advance because what the allies needed to be able to do was establish a beachhead if they could get a toehold and get landed and marshal their forces then it was then it was as churchill said it is not the the end the beginning he said it's not even the beginning of the end he said it is perhaps the end of the beginning because from there they could march in through france and cross through belgium and into europe and into the rhineland and and and move axis forces back but but but the axis forces knew that if they can just stop them from getting that first initial beachhead landing then they can they can either prolong or maybe even force the allies to just try to have a peace and i thought about how the enemy has taken this first youth camp this very first one for bethel tabernacle and we're just a small seaside church 120 couple people counting youngans and and and there was really no way to do it and the enemy has fought us and fought us and fought us but god in this first year has established a beachhead amen and from here i believe we can push on to the coming of the lord i i sent you i hope you got it i sent you a little message from my heart to yours uh on the uh on the camp text i hope you got that if you did if you didn't ask somebody to show it to you just a few is because that's what he's got and covid erased all of that but fortunately he had a super wife who remembered it all amen and sister amy was like no this is what you're going to do no this is what we're going to do and and i'm here to tell you and sister rachel my my own daughter-in-law and all of the other ladies and brothers behind and behind every good man was a better woman probably and and it and and you know but regardless of all of that none of it could have been possible if it weren't for you and i i i want to salute you young people god bless you for your stand god bless you for your courage and and as great as that is none of it at all with all of those teams and all of that leadership and you coming and all of us gathering and preachers preaching brother branham said i can he said no matter how anointed i can be in the back he said if i come out and there's resistance he said god won't move brother john could have prayed and fasted for 40 days she put in an order so why don't you raise your hand and put in your order right now say lord i have needs yet we've had service after service we've had prayer lines and prayer lines and prayer lines but i still have a need lord and i'm still before you today and i want you to come in the power and demonstration of your word not word only but empowered demonstration of the holy ghost i believe god will see that hand amen god bless you brother john we want to welcome you it's been awesome to have you here the other ministers that have ministered along with you uh brother burley who couldn't be here this morning he had to cover base at home and uh we so appreciate him appreciate brother diggs i appreciate all the people that made this possible amen were there any other ministers that that went down the list by the

jason demars needs our prayers this morning he labored right through uh valiantly last night with uh us praying for you and today he just needs our prayers he's not going to be at the service live but i'm just praying the lord jesus will just touch him and take away dizziness can all the warriors join together now we're going to sing this someone's needy lord then we're going to pray for our jason

yes lord jesus thank you lord god oh lord come by all right let's bow our heads and you pray and we'll pray together our dear heavenly father we're lifting up our hands in this atmosphere first we want to praise you and thank you for your mighty goodness for your mercy and the passion of your love that has ran after each one of us this weekend it's like you have cradled us in your arms lord you have spoken very deeply to our hearts we will never be the same we can never be the same lord after going into that private place with you now lord we stand with a need this morning of our brave brother jason to mars you see lord these last weeks and how satan had would have loved to have taken him out and taken him from us and you see even last night late the dizziness was trying to afflict him and even this morning lord there's many warriors here that have their hands lifted and we're joining our faith together that the healing angel would go by that little trailer wherever brother jason demars is right now strengthen his body strengthen his mind send a double portion of your vitamins and your strength lord into our brother how he's labored how he's unselfishly given of himself and his family lord i pray that you would pour back into our brother jason let us rise up as a generation and learn to pray one for the other and hold one another up in prayer let us not just talk about it let us not just sing about it let us not just preach about it but let us go into action now and let our faith be exercised in this closing service lord we just have a few more moments together before we leave and i'm asking the presence of god would settle upon this building like a cloak lord that every word would be directed from your heart to our hearts take the last few words you say may they bring a reality to all of us in jesus name amen amen let's turn to our scripture first corinthians chapter 15 this morning how many believe in miracles we have less than an hour how many believe in miracles praise god so amen y'all be praying for brother john that we can uh be a miracle today amen first corinthians chapter 15 brothers i think we'll go right to the scripture good morning bethel tabernacle youth camp here we are we've come down to this are we going to run together well are we going to finish strong are you going to work with us i mean you pull really hard and god give brother john discipline from behind the pulpit i just want to say what he wants to say to you and then we all have to go but let's just bring our thoughts our strength you probably didn't get a lot of sleep last night i didn't either so we're all in this together but it's not by our might or by our strength it's by the spirit of god and we want to speak this morning on the rising generation and i believe i'm speaking to some of them first corinthians chapter 15 verse 49 i believe young people can take the meat of the word and go a little bit deeper so here we are paul speaking in verse 49 and as we have borne the image of the earth earthy i want you to notice the rest of the verses we're going to read the shall the all it includes all of us and it's so positive as we have bore the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly you are going to make it right now this i say brethren that the flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does corruption inherit incorruption behold paul said i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed is that what the bible says we're not going to leave any of you out we shall all be changed in a moment let's all say a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we shall be changed how many realize that could happen during this service right now how many realize brother branham could come walking through that back door how many of you have loved ones in your church or family that have passed away that you know are believers they could come walking brother jason right up the stairway come walking out behind this curtain come sister deb right back there wouldn't that be wonderful i mean i would certainly wake up some of you amen you talk about a last service that we would have as we would see these things we're living in the time of the resurrection young people this is the very next event for the bride of christ is for the resurrection but before that change god's bringing messages to you to prepare your heart to be ready thank you jesus verse 53 for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible no matter how young you are or strong you are all of our bodies and even our minds and our brains are passing away and it's corrupting when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ thanks be to god who giveth bethel tabernacle youth camp and all of us together the victory we have the victory not we will have it you have it it's in you [Music] so what are what's some of the final words in verse 58 that we're going to hear after the closing remarks after all of this has been said and done therefore my beloved brethren young people be steadfast unmovable always say always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as ye know to all the teams we thank you we know that your labor is not in faith in the lord when you do something as unto the lord it's not in vain jesus is in this building right now does anybody else sense him anybody else sense though that other presence it's there to awaken you and that's why we have these meetings that would awaken these desires that you have inside of you for him he's here to awaken those things our last closing remarks may the lord speak to you in jesus name thank you you can have your seats and the brothers bring up our slides the rising generation and because our time is short and brother john is part of the miracle that's going to happen this morning and get you out before your lunch time thank you for letting us come and be part of your lives this is a a unique service a special for all of us i want to speak as as a middle-aged man born and raised in the message to you speaking to the rising generation and i believe what brother branham said in this quote is now been made real this weekend as you have made individual booths as we heard last night and that there's something laying right ahead for us and brother branham in the message a man running from the presence of the lord said remember i believe i'm prophesying great joys lays ahead believe it that's right many saddened hearts will be made great mysteries will be made clear and people who are sad will be turned into joy thank you jesus and as this weekend we've walked together through this is actually a doctors looking into the heart of the matter you can see them as they're looking over the heart of the person and and we've spoken along with brother burley and brother cadre and brother jason we've we've linked our gifts together for you to be servants on restoration and we've seen even throughout these last months how god has brought a theme now of restoration and how it's just continuing and last night we were speaking about the spiritual contractions trying to understand the thirst and the spasms and the groanings of what you have been going through as young people and then just directing your hearts to the booths now just as we leave our the campground this afternoon and all of us will and i prayed with my wife before the meetings and as we came into this services that every single person that came on to this campground as you drove in that when you drove out that you would be changed and i believe for some of you that has happened and i believe for all of us were better christians this afternoon than when we came onto the grounds prayers have gone for you and the restoration now of your booth is now up to your consecration it comes back to your personal dedication to the lord it's not for the crowd now we're we're gonna leave the camp and the 400 people or so and this afternoon we're going to have fathers and mothers and pastors and grandparents picking us up and driving us back to the airport and buses and in cars and summon airplanes as i just checked my flight and i think it's okay for tomorrow morning but here we are speaking to a rising generation and uh thank you brothers maybe you can just leave it on a slide number one as i just come to the service for the rising generation are you ready for this remember miracles do happen and i believe i'm i'm standing in the midst of a miracle in first corinthians chapter 15 that we read about the resurrection and there's two risings that i want to focus on this morning and that is number one the bride is rising now listen really fast with me the bride is rising but one day the sleeping saints are going to rise they've been sleeping they've been laying in the ground they've been waiting for you and i to come to our placing they've been waiting for the last one and there's been years have gone by you've had grand great-grandparents and grandparents and fathers and mothers and now and people around you and now there has to be a generation rise up that realize we are not in a going-down generation but we are in a rising generation when jesus stood in front of the tomb of lazarus and said lazarus come forth there was so much power and authority in that voice that if he would have said come forth every dead person would have come out of the grave come forth but he spoke specifically he spoke his name and lazarus walked out of the grave and he was stinking after four days and that was the duty of christ the messiah how many is thankful for the holy ghost how he speaks to us how many know what jesus then said to the people around the family the people he said loose him and let him go take off those grave clothes take off those those dead things and that is our responsibility to one another as we leave this campground when we go back home to our families and our jobs our schools and churches we have a responsibility god does his part right but we have our part and young people it's time to rise and step up into your calling you're not babies you're not children and we're not gonna handle you with kid gloves no more we we're very earnest today i think it's a time to be sober hello if you're slumbering or if you're sleeping like the foolish virgin it's time to wake up wise virgins also in matthew they were slumbering and sleeping the bible says they all slumbered but at midnight there came a cry and that has already happened now where god has awakened now the bride of christ some of you already going to sleep here amen did y'all stay up late last night it's time to rise this is like the final words of the captain of the lord of hosts with his sword drawn and standing in front of us saying go forward let's go on lazarus come forth you put your name there come forth in the in the name of the lord jesus christ maybe put a loved one there i'm gonna go out from here receiving a charge a commission stop being so selfish stop thinking always of your needs and your life and you know iphone and ipad and it's a me generation and all the selfies you know and all of that it's time to now be mature young people take out the garbage say thank you to your mother it's amazing how we can go from the third pool right down into our where we live brother john takes out the trash at our house that's what real men do sometimes you gotta get dirty sometimes you gotta say i'm sorry that should be the zeal of young people to say i'm sorry i'm wrong just deposit your arrogant spirit in a trash can back there by by brother yawns and brother gurgle just deposit it there it's the holy spirit speaking to you you've packed your bags maybe you're going to you brushed your teeth you came today but i'm going to speak directly to your situation and the mind of the lord for now this season as we go out i want to speak very clearly because we don't have time to talk between the lines victories lay in your future it's time to get up and go forward it's time to press on and obey it's take the words that you've heard from a little baby from a little youth and stop going to meetings like this and going back home and then throwing it back into the face of god a week later two weeks later and you're back worse than you ever was don't do that this year all of heaven's behind you all of the word is behind you it's time to arrest it's time to leave it's time to go praise god the bride of jesus christ is living in a revival time the wife of christ is actively making ourselves ready brother branham said in the seventh seal when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of christ you become so far away from your own thinking till in your own mind he said don't let me try to explain that because i can't i couldn't do it there's nobody could do it friends as we go along as young people as you get a little older you realize your minds will fail your forget things as people have gotten older and as lifestyles have gotten older in north america and around the world there's something called dementia and alzheimer's that grips good people how many many's ever heard of that before dementia alzheimer's they forget who they are they'll forget a family member the people that used to love you and embrace you and their face would just light up and they would just be able to communicate now you walk in and they look at you and there's no response you could be family you could be someone at church and they just look at you and hello we're here to visit you and they just look at you like this it's alzheimer's something's affected their brain it's a disease it's where satan comes in at the end time to destroy minds spiritually there's a lot of people that suffer from spiritual dementia spiritual alzheimer's they they forgot who they are they forgot where they're going and god help us this is not a backsliding time this is not time to get worldly this is not the time to be too busy you've got you say i don't have time or i'm too busy but you've got time for a lot of other things we've heard some strong word this weekend but it's time to show by our lives that we believe believers believe not just in a service but where the rubber meets the road and at school and in your family and when it's just and you might not even get the lunch time or go get home and something negative happens how are you going to respond to that it's time to rise you are living in a right generation this is the time to be ascending getting higher in christ going to spiritual places that you've never been before you've never you don't understand you've never been there you feel like like the mother eagle is kicking you out of the nest and you and you're turning around saying what are you doing why is it so prickly in this nest it's god telling you it's time to fly stop fussing stop singing those old songs and you know done somebody wrong song and talking about your hurt and your wound and your brokenness it's time for you to believe the word of god and in the bible there was a prince called mephibosheth and she was a prince that was wounded from a little child when jonathan and saul were killed in the message they wounded a but as the years went by and david now came to his place of anointing and kingship he said is there anyone of the family of jonathan that's alive and they said yes there's prince mephibosheth but he lives far away in lotabar out of cell range he's lived in a far desert place he's hiding from you and david said go get and mephibosheth walks in on his crutches and on his troubles and complexes thinking david's going to have him destroyed oh i finally got the prince that's been but that wasn't what was in david's heart that that's not what's in god's heart to destroy you he's here to elevate you and promote you you all know the story david brought him to the king's table said i want you to be around me around the king's table and so there was always times that mephibosheth would come walking in he would come a little early because there's a little bit of embarrassment and shame sometimes when you've been hurt and when you're wounded and he'd come in like this his legs whether it was crutches or i don't know if they had wheelchairs and he would put the crutches under the seat sister paris and he would just sit down at the table like this i don't know whose cell phone this is but it's got a nice cover and ten dollars in the back praise god i'll just take this cover off him is that for starbucks money oh it's not your phone okay and everybody's walking in and all the people's walking in they're all happy and sitting at the table mephibosheth down at the table and david comes walking in the king and mephibosheth is just tears coming out of his eyes because all sitting around the table we're all the same you can't see my lameness you can't see what's going on but i'm just glad to be here and david is there in his presence and it's so wonderful to be around the king and isn't it wonderful to be the king's kids and a daughter of god and a son of god who thinks that's wonderful and you cannot see the lameness under the table it's all under the blood it's all behind you leave the past behind you and rise jump out of the net and let the wings of faith carry you into god's will for your life and don't be ashamed of it don't be ashamed of what god's done for your life you're not going to flap fall flat on your face and if you do what are you gonna do you just get back up again you brush yourself off you get the mud off and you keep pressing on that's a rising generation god's asking some of you to step out of your comfort zone and to move from the carnal to the spiritual he's asking you to move addresses from the earthly to the heavenly i'm speaking very clearly i hope you're listening good move from being so carnal and moving to being more spiritual it's time to check out from this world it's time to check out from this world it's time for the saints that are sleeping to rise hallelujah luke chapter 17 speaks about the coming of the lord we don't have time it speaks about two will be in a bed one will be taken and the other left how many's heard that before okay so we don't need to turn to it two in a one will be taken and one will be left so it wasn't a homosexual lifestyle because one left is everybody being spiritual wake up you don't need the ministry to always be speaking about relationships to get into the service you're old enough to take some of these things now two in a bed one will be taken and one will be left that's got to be you two will be grinding at the field and working one's gonna be taken and one's going to be left the one that's taken that is you two will be in a field one will be taken one think about how close of a relationship would be to be in the same house to be in the same bed one has a walk with god one has their own private booth one has their own consecrated life and the very person brother matthew that's right next to them is not where they should be we sing when we all get to heaven but it is an individual walk with god malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 speaks about a generation that would receive a word prophet that's number one number two their hearts would be turned turn from the world turn from the things of this life i was going to say denominations but most of you don't even know what the denomination is that was 30 years ago in the message hello from conventions and youth meetings has come out of herd come out of denominations most young people don't even know what you're talking about brother cadre that's not the nations that they need deliverance from in the prayer line last night and personal when young ladies come up and young men just i could ask all the ministers was there one of them that say i need help to come out of the baptist denomination brother mike brother mike just stand to your feet he's our senior elder brother mike was there any of the young ladies or young men that said i need deliverance from the catholic church and the say it loud any of these brothers the young people of today you're living in another generation but there are a lot of nations that are trying to capture our young people and it's time to rise out of them i'm asking this morning where is the generation that will go in the rapture where are you are you hiding in despair are you in a cave of despondency are you always depressed and talking about somebody issue are you always so wounded that a friend left you and you get thumbs down you all know what i'm talking about 30 years ago they would have said what are you talking about every single person here probably knows what i'm talking about like dislike right i don't care if there's 648 of this but jesus gives you this you follow christ i'm speaking my last sermon this morning to you the last generation this is what's on our hearts you are the generation that's going to make the change you are the generation that paul talked about brother branham talked about mid of old and sages they would have loved to have been at this camp service do we recognize our day and its message that there will be a generation believers that arising in the individual it's time to rise up i think brother caleb campbell where you at this morning had that yesterday it's time to get up it's time to wake up oh i'm sleepy i'm tired it's time to wake up it's time to stir yourself time to get stirring and get active because we're living in the final the final act of an age the bride is making ready to go and putting the final touches on his master pieces there's been camps camps brides brides churches churches generations young ladies young men but one day there's going to be a generation there's going to come a sweep over us there's just in a twinkling of an eye everybody twinkle your eye just like this now don't look to either side of the room you know but you just twink your eye like that's how fast it's gonna happen you shall be changed let's turn to first thessalonians we need this and this miracle we're walking in a miracle right now look up for your redemption drawleth nigh first thessalonians chapter 4. i'm just going to read one verse but you can read maybe write this down some of you are writing notes that's very good very good first thessalonians chapter 4 is the rapture chapter verse 16. the bible says for the lord himself and we got the lion of the tribe of judah up there all right first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16 for the lord himself let's say lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout out that's number one right with the voice of the archangel number two and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise that's what we're looking for the resurrection is a real event it's the hope of the church and i have quotes for what i'm saying to you it's the hope of the church is the coming of the lord so before the great and dreadful day of the lord god's going to send a prophet that will literally turn the hearts of the last day children back to the faith and i thank god for the hickory bible tabernacle choir and how they they sang that song with passion and that god has lit your flame i hope some of you god has lit your flame i heard some of you sisters rejoicing and responding last night don't ever be embarrassed in the presence of god just learn to know that that is the place that's a safe when i walk out of airplanes many times and you'll see right on the wall the jetway jason it said this airport is a safe place that means if you're going through times of trouble or if you feel danger in your life you can come to this place talk to somebody staff talk to an airline talk to somebody this is a safe place if you're abused if you're being handled wrong this presence of god is a safe place learn to run in there learn to let go learn to let off the pressure learn to lift hands let's try it right now let's all lift these hands some of you are very tired some of you are take these hands and lift them up for i have not the strength near enough and then you start just this is a safe place i just heard yesterday of another church in the message and it's just high level things where young boys are being mishandled sexually that just does something to me it touches a raw nerve not just one two three up to five you want to see the blood boil of a real man of god is when you hear about that happening and people trying to cover it up and condone it that's not the message i don't care who it is what it is when that's all that we've preached for and lived for is to strengthen our young people strengthen our families and for a spirit to come in and people's trying to cover it up trying to sanction it because they're related to the pastor this is just yesterday i said god rebuked that thing that is not the holy ghost that is not the nature of the word there needs to be a rooting out and a repentance that's why there's a lack of revival in the message it's because young people hear what we've heard this weekend and they go back home and go back to places that is hiding sin we our young people deserve better than that [Applause] you're god's children and first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16 we see this just quickly the shout the voice and the trumpet brother bradham said in the rapture message december the 4th 1965 the word rapture in the bible is not even used at all but the bible said caught up being caught up and that's in first thessalonians that was later down in that chapter it's the order of the great rapture that will take place in the last days three things that has to happen before the lord himself appears are you listening quickly shout voice a trumpet has to happen before jesus appears jesus does all three of them when he's descending i'm reading from a prophet a shout it's the message going forth the living bread of life bringing forth the bride so if jesus does all three of these things as he descends and the shout is the message we have a right to say this morning the message the rapture has already began it's a catching away it's something to gather the people together a shout and then a trumpet the trumpet is with the sound of a truck a voice i'm sorry i'm just trying to go quickly and skipping over but he said what is it a shout a voice and trumpet a shout it's the message to getting ready the second is the voice of the resurrection the same voice let's all say same voice with a loud voice not a whisper but in john 11 when he called lazarus from the grave getting the bride together the resurrection of the dead and to be caught up with it watch the three things the the next was a trumpet shout voice and a trumpet the sound of a trumpet what does it call a trumpet calls and he's talking about the feast of the trumpets a pentecostal feast and the feast of the trumpets he goes on but a trumpet is to announce a calling together that's what we've had this weekend also spiritually we have been introduced in the month of october to the feast of tabernacles but before the feast you've got to have a booth do i have your attention you've got to get personal and private the rapture is a stirring friends this is not the time to fall back i'm giving you these final words this is not the time to fall back you cannot fall back it's time to step up like going up a ladder come on young people step up [Applause] matthew chapter 9 is an illustration of the scripture one of the illustrations of jesus matthew 9 verse 18 we're not going to turn to it of a maid a damsel a young girl a teenage girl maybe or a young girl the bible says maiden where jesus raised her from the dead they all said she was dead listen to me are you listening they are he's dead and jesus said no she's just sleeping and you know what the bible says they laughed him to scorn he was something and they were seeing another it's time that we turn our and stop talking about the death and speak about the resurrection so where do you have your eyes this morning are you looking at all the death and the problems or you have your eyes on i'm with you jesus she's just sleeping and just speak the word he got everybody out of the house and in just a few moments she was walking around oh thank god she can go to lunch praise god it's been extended from two o'clock to 5 5 30. now we can talk and isn't it beautiful everybody look over here outside be distracted for a moment goodness well the travis told me about the water and the lake and so we're going to go out there in a few minutes in a few minutes there's another place in luke 7. are we doing okay there was a dead boy being brought out of the city of name it was a widow the mother his mother was a widow that means the boy had lost his father and it was the only child and jesus saw everybody crying and weeping and he said you know what there's going to be a monday for that young man i see a tuesday i see another birthday i see another year i see you as an overcomer i see you as somebody that's going to be strong in the church i'm going to say something right now for many many years been raised in the message brother john has been raised in the message there's a little slogan and a little phrase we've heard for many many years said by a lot of ministers and that is that the young people and the children of the message are the church of tomorrow and they would address them that you are the church of tomorrow you are the church of tomorrow he's never heard that before you people and the children are the message of church of tomorrow let me just say something this morning tomorrow has arrived i'm not speaking to the church of tomorrow you are the church of the now you are the generation that is breathing these messages and word it's pulsating in your bosom some of you will never reach 20 30 40. you're gonna be changed we need that door left open brother thank you brother it's getting a little warm in here thank you brother hey just push it wide open thank you brother come on in we need this you missed the last few minutes how many get what i say if i said you're the church of tomorrow you said then i got time brother john i got time we don't have no more time time is up we're in overtime some of you that love sports no you can go whole regulation basketball hockey football whatever you like and then it'll go to regulation then there'll be overtime and that's when you leave it all out on the field you might be tired you might be weary you might be battered you might your your uniform's all muddy and grating or whatever and you're just you're sucking air come on everybody but when overtime hits you know this is when the second wind this is when everything you've trained for everything that you believe for and forgive me if i offend you but let all the losers just sit on the bench if you don't have that kind of spirit ask god to give it to you but don't stand in the bride's way we're going up you want to stay in a tribulation that's up to you you want to go to a hell where brother branham said a burning literal hell would be like electrical wires going through you come on friends the first five minutes of when the rapture happens is going to be glorious for the bride but it's going to be torment for those in the message that have been in this type of atmosphere and missed the rapture there ought to be some zeal in your heart i will not miss the rapture [Applause] you may be seated let's give the microphone to brother paul what do you have to say it's time to lay aside every way and the unbelief that you came to camp with the sin that is holding you down i'm speaking to young ladies and young men it might be as small as a little lipstick thing or a little you know you're paining your fingernails shame on you we're supposed to be a bride we're not to look like the world who are you trying to impress living a double life living a double standard god knows all your hinder parts and your naked parts say i've done good this weekend nobody knows and i'm going to go right back yeah you go back but there's another generation that's going to take these messages and take this atmosphere that god knew that's why satan fought this camp so hard is because there was a blessing for you there was a revival for you there was a message for you as the days have gone by now as the weeks have gone by as the months have gone by in years now many people are becoming a victim to exactly what the devil planned and what he schemed and what he devised for this generation he planned an excellent diversion plan i've got to distract the people from the word a year and a half ago that's what was in satan's laboratory some of you thought it was out of wuhan china or whatever you think but it was a diversion from satan to take you away from the word and to get your mind on shutdowns masks vaccinations testing data science you can get quite all you want to he got your mind on numbers and virus counts and politics trump or biden it's not going to be the democrats that get you in a rapture it's not going to be the republicans it's not going to be the independence it's going to be thus saith the lord some of you in your churches were just coasting along and this virus came out of nowhere the sickness it was on television it was on media it was even in message purpose oh the sickness the virus the death but let me say this today it was not the government that shut down churches spiritually it was not local health officials that caused the coolness and the death to be stripping away revival from the people there's not one person that can claim an excuse for backsliding there's not one believer that can give an excuse of worldly events or school or officials you can get so upset at the officials no backsliding is not an option for a son or daughter of god and i encourage you my wife said the more they clap the longer you preach so i love you clapping i really do but i'm working in a miracle right now don't become a statistic you are the church of today tomorrow arrived and god has raised up young people globally globally i'm speaking this in south carolina but brother john has personally witnessed in the last six months throughout all the united states and then in europe that we've traveled and then globally speaking to young people there is a group of young men and women that are ready to serve they have been trained right their attitude is right their character is right they don't speak condescending they handle with care they speak the truth in love because they came from the womb of the message that old fighting spirit and the whole message there were old fighters that fought and through the wilderness and they had to be that way they feraled the field for us but brother branham talked about the sons of the old fighters it was that generation into the promised land and you can say what you want think what you want but you have to acknowledge that you are in another season and another time another era and you are living in a generation that god had in his mind a certain caliber of young men and young ladies older ones younger ones alike i'm not making ages here this is a generation it's not just young people joshua and caleb they were older caleb was older when he said give me my mountain he was 85 years old my father is 80 years old but i'm i'm not speaking to you in a way to push you down i'm saying this is your time to rise are we doing okay i want to give a warning brother burly gave some mornings i want to get media obsession is a disease i'm speaking to young people the message some of my closing remarks media obsession is a disease it clouds the mind it clouds the spirit and it opens up the gates of the soul to wrong spirits some of you young people need to listen really good right now media obsession is a global pandemic it's the greatest global pandemic and covid is not the greatest covet pandemic sorry it is a covert pandemic but it's not the greatest pandemic that's in the world covet is not brother john has seen it media obsession is a virus it's a disease of devices electronic devices where young people are becoming digital addictors they're addicted to digital devices not drugs not alcohol not pills not gaming even though some young people and parents are more into gaming than the word of god then you wonder why your young people are the way they are it's time for fathers to arise mothers to arise ministers to arise the church to arise even science will tell you my my time is gone that dopamine is a chemical in the brain that is released through chemical devices but the holy spirit has sent another wage another wave and another surge of the holy spirit we've heard enough about it in the last year another wave another surge of this crazy virus it comes in and it'll go out and we've heard about these waves and these surges but i want to announce to you today there's another wave there's another surge it's called the holy ghost it's a powerful sudden forward motion then it goes upward then it goes out then it goes in and then it's going to take you away one day it's a supernatural force like the waves of tide that comes in and goes out this wave of the holy spirit that is moving and we've all heard about cases and restrictions and lockdowns and social distancing and we've we've said it already masks and vaccines and you know are you vaccinated are you not vaccinated have you been testing us enough and not friends we're in a rising generation death is striking the land sickness is striking the land but so is another wave of the holy ghost it's a global surge in the youth of this message it's a worldwide wave of god's quickening power it's back on display we saw it last night hallelujah we see it right now it's in the bride it's in the youth it's in the youth without borders it's the holy spirit does not need a passport or a visa to come into your country let's go to our slides now i want to introduce you before we close it's 120 do i have a few more minutes okay as we come to our the end of the service i want to introduce you to this lion but i want to introduce you to the lamb you all going to give me a few more minutes no the rising generation you've been liking to sheep sheep tabernacle youth camp this is this is the body language of the holy spirit this weekend he's been reaching for you that's wonderful let this be something how a person can be going astray and that god is going to make you profitable in your life i'm speaking now to the rising generation you might have come into this camp unprofitable but god is going to make you profitable all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all i have gone astray david said like a lost sheep seek thy servant for i do not forget thy commandment and we look at going astray some of you were in this condition coming to camp but you it means to air or wonder to stagger to wonder about the wondering of the mind mentally morally this is going astray this is what it means and the believer is typed as sheep all the bible says we was astray away from the shepherd and away from the fold and god has been encouraging us to come back come back and then god gives you patience for other sheep to mature and come to their place so it creates an atmosphere like a team that i i have now patience for others from unprofitable now god's gonna make you profitable from a slave to not much eternal good in your life a freedom to a prophet to a blessing to contributing to the body how many want to be a con contribution i wanted to introduce you to chris you all laugh but some of you look like this on thursday night this is chris he was lost for six years brother jason this is another picture of chris isn't that wonderful you want to post that this afternoon on your status i mean this is in australia even the kangaroos are looking at him saying what's wrong with you god bless you look at this this is what he looked like when he was caught and so when he was caught there was an australian sheepshear that had set a record for clipping sheet and he realized that this this guy's life is endangered this this gigantic sheep named chris had been found he could barely walk he was remember you and me are like sheep but from this sheep that was lost when he was found the wool that was from his that had grown it yielded 30 sweaters i was going to have 15 sister stan and 15 brothers stand and sweaters he was profitable but he was lost it's incredible so he started to share this was the champion man shearing he had to be sedated brother chris because the cruelty of animals division it took 45 minutes to remove 18 inches 47 centimeters of fleece i want you to look at that because that's going to mean something 88 pounds of 45 minutes and this man said i don't think he'd been shorn before and i think he's five or six years old i wouldn't say it's high quality but you wouldn't expect it after so long in the bush but this chris he was br they're bred for especially for their rule they need to be they need to go to church regularly they need to go to church regularly or they can have trouble going to the bathroom and can develop serious medical issues oh my all thinking about this young people go through things if we don't go to the house of god and get shoring we have issues you might be just fine but you start having trouble in this certain area yeah it's desperate the average australian fleece takes approximately three minutes let's all say three minutes how long did it take to shear chris that's how long it takes when you're out of the spirit when you're not living where you should it takes a long time but just a few moments in his presence just an opening song just you know somebody gives a scripture and you're right there that's how it ought to be after you leave this camp just a few minutes brother branham talked about this about wool and lamb in the dove listen look you ought to listen to that message maybe this next week and how a sheep just lays there forfeits its rights this is chris after he was shorn a little bloody it hadn't happened before look at this rule 88 pounds and god is likening you and i to sheep that have gone astray i'm trying to click this brother matthew and it's not clicking so the miracle needs to continue help me out brothers what a photo is that beautiful this is chris chris needs help just keep clicking brothers you know he was found just a few kilometers from a farm he wasn't way away he was very close it wasn't like he was thousands of miles away some of you thought you were will far away and you've been brought very close god found you found your heart and you can see this how he had suffered things and he would have died within weeks brother jason the reason god allowed this weekend is because god knew if some of you wouldn't have been here there would have been trouble ahead so god fought through all of the unbelief so you could be here to be healed he was shy he was shaking this is shriek or shrek this is our last person i'm going to introduce you to this this young person had held the the record for years before chris he was hiding in a cave they found him hiding in a cave next slide help me out brothers you know sheep look so different when they're soaring we're closing now this is you and me when god really works in our hearts this is you and me god speaking to peter said take care of my lambs feed my lambs feed my sheep that is a commission we are commissioned to feed the lambs come down to their level and whatever it takes from going astray to being profitable what do you feel like that this sheep felt like after the wool was taken off what do you all feel like when all this wool and all this stuff is taken off and what do you all feel like we're going to leave this afternoon like it's time to arise it's time to go it's time to go serve it's time to live it's time to next slide brothers here we are coming down to the end go back one go back one more backwards just like a real sheep of god feels like after its excess wool is sheared off free happy unburdened and light and there's scriptures we could have read but in closing brother jason talked about world war ii there was something called a shepherd pilot and that was a pilot that was guided to come next to another airplane that had been damaged and been hit and it's wounded and it's barely making it back to the base you got to make it back home the goal is to make it back safe but you say i've been wounded i've been shot out and they had what they called a shepherd pilot that would fly up and not take their place but they would fly up very near and you could watch that pilot and you could look at them and they're giving you a thumbs up and they're saying yes yes we're gonna make it we're gonna make it they didn't take your place but they only flew right in they're called a shepherd pilot where uh someone that had been disabled brought back to the base by flying just right i'm just here for to make visual contact let's fly home let's make it back to the base i see that you're wounded i see that your left wing is on fire but it's okay we're going to make it we're going to make it we're very close it's very near let's get ready to land let's put down the landing gear we're going to be there and he's just flying yes lord yes lord thank you
