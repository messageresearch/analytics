[3:12] have any words
[3:13] um
[3:14] to express
[3:15] uh last night
[3:18] and how the spirit of the Lord moved in
[3:21] such a special way and throughout all of
[3:24] the services the night before that all
[3:26] the way from the beginning not as all I
[3:28] can do is raise my hands and say thank

[4:15] tired bone in your body but uh we're so
[4:18] uh thankful for all of the brothers who

[4:21] we will be having Camp again Lord
[4:24] willing uh next year unless the Rapture
[4:27] takes place and if not we'll all be at
[4:28] one big youth meeting uh in the sky and
[4:31] I'm looking forward to that day I also
[4:33] just say I love and appreciate you know
[4:35] it's it's amazing uh how many it's such
[4:39] a such a
[4:40] um a needed necessary burden for
[4:44] brothers to have a heart for our youth
[4:47] and the generation that's living in the
[4:49] world that we're living in we support
[4:50] all of the youth camps and the brothers
[4:52] we send our kids to them and I think
[4:54] every single Camp ministers maybe to you
[4:57] in a different way or the Lord speaks to
[4:59] you I'm just thankful we got Brothers
[5:01] all across the states all across the
[5:03] world that have a heart and a burden for
[5:06] young people to minister to them because
[5:08] they're facing the greatest battle ever
[5:10] fall and let me just say his brother
[5:12] John Andy said we're right in that same
[5:14] battle with you I might be up on a stage
[5:16] and you might be down there but in
[5:18] reality I'm right down there in that
[5:20] seat right with you on Monday fighting
[5:22] the devil just like you are
[5:24] and we all need each other we all need
[5:27] one another and we need the different
[5:28] various Ministry gifts that God has
[5:30] given to the body to encourage us
[5:34] um there is uh I was asked by two or
[5:36] three people already where they where
[5:38] they can go to see the Camp videos we
[5:40] have the skip video we have different
[5:42] videos of people
[5:44] um go on the swing and going down the
[5:46] swing and screaming all the way up and
[5:49] all the way down and all the way up and
[5:50] all the way down that was my mom doing
[5:52] that
[5:54] she was the first girl on the swing and
[5:56] she was screaming the whole time
[5:58] and uh and so we have those videos just
[6:02] different videos that maybe we have our
[6:04] church website our YouTube and Facebook
[6:06] different platforms where you can go and
[6:07] see the archives of the services and the
[6:09] skits but also we have a Bethel Youth
[6:12] Camp is that what it's called Brother JD
[6:14] Facebook uh bethelyouthcamp.org also the
[6:17] website where we are posting where we'll
[6:19] be posting little videos you might see
[6:21] yourself
[6:22] um I hope you were smiling and happy
[6:25] um on those videos but you might see
[6:27] your cell phone there we got we took
[6:29] some special ones and we're going to be
[6:30] uploading those and and so you can find
[6:33] those online videos of kids dancing and
[6:36] singing in the spirit and having the joy
[6:38] of the Lord last night I just uh I
[6:41] couldn't believe just I took a video I
[6:43] almost wanted to play it today at the
[6:44] bonfire last night and then the night
[6:46] before that and last night there was
[6:48] young people and a brother brother Cade
[6:50] was singing uh
[6:52] he picked me up turned me around and all
[6:57] the young people just praise the Lord
[6:58] and I stepped back I thought you know
[7:00] most of these young people are 18 or 15
[7:04] to 18 to 25 right at that they are right
[7:07] at that age where if you if you measure
[7:09] them to the rest of the world here they
[7:12] are at a bonfire and they're worshiping
[7:15] and praising and singing and jumping and
[7:17] dancing before the Lord and I thought
[7:18] you know they're the
[7:22] 0.00001 of the entire world of the same
[7:26] age group there are other kids who are
[7:28] in college they're at a bonfire they're
[7:30] partying and drinking but here we are
[7:32] worshiping the Lord drunk in the Holy
[7:35] Spirit
[7:37] Hallelujah
[7:39] and I thought what a victory these young
[7:42] people facing hell every day of their
[7:44] life
[7:45] and I just thought who in the world
[7:46] could ever criticize that
[7:51] who in the world could ever say a
[7:53] negative thing of that we got young
[7:54] people who have the joy of the Lord and
[7:56] want to worship God I jumped right in
[7:58] there with you and felt like a young
[7:59] person again
[8:02] how many appreciate brother Diggs
[8:05] Hallelujah
[8:07] [Applause]
[8:10] amen use brother Diggs in a special way
[8:12] at that bonfire service there for us and
[8:15] I just appreciate all the brothers if I
[8:17] start naming different names that will
[8:18] get in trouble to forget somebody but

[48:34] wonderful weekend and just bid you
[48:37] farewell till next year and maybe I'll
[48:39] see you in between that all of my young
[48:41] people I certainly better see you amen
[48:44] Wednesday night amen but we hope to see
[48:48] if y'all want to show up Wednesday night
[48:50] at our church you can we won't be able
[48:52] to seat you but we you can still come
[48:54] but we're very happy and I just love how
[48:58] everything has went and I I have said
[49:02] you know I've had a couple people say
[49:04] you know you know are you preaching are
[49:06] you going to preach and I said man I
[49:08] would like to but the way we did
[49:11] me off okay so y'all need to you need to
[49:16] protest
[49:18] and uh and so I said um yeah you know I
[49:22] it's a it's a fact that
[49:24] um probably your age group has rapidly
[49:28] become my favorite people to preach to I
[49:31] said I would rather preach one Youth
[49:34] Camp than preach five sets of regular
[49:36] meetings because
[49:38] so I'm going to keep preaching yeah
[49:41] now I'm you want me to whack it like
[49:44] okay
[49:46] if if if all else fails whack it yeah
[49:51] and so uh
[49:53] so it has really become my my favorite
[49:56] group to preach to I appreciate your
[49:58] Zeal Your Enthusiasm your uh quite
[50:02] magical to me I just know it's this the
[50:04] hand of God has done it I'm sure you can
[50:07] hear I feel like I've preached I've done
[50:09] enough shouting and screaming and
[50:10] Hallelujah and wanted to blow through
[50:12] the roof and land in the lake a couple
[50:14] of times but my it's been so thrilling
[50:17] the word of God and I I think I'd like
[50:20] to give a round of applause to our two
[50:22] ministers brother Josh and brother John
[50:24] amen
[50:34] and all of our teams and we have a lot
[50:38] of them we have uh there's so much that
[50:40] goes on in the background that you don't
[50:42] have you don't know you don't have to
[50:44] worry about it it's sight unseen but
[50:45] things get done to make to make this
[50:48] Camp experience uh go good for you and
[50:51] the experience we want you to have is
[50:54] not an entertainment experience or a
[50:56] recreation experience but a god
[50:57] experience
[50:58] amen because you know it is God who drew
[51:02] you here and uh it is the Lord who's
[51:05] really the only one who can really do
[51:07] anything for you of Eternal value we can
[51:10] treat you nice and uh we can you know
[51:13] like you and you can like us but
[51:15] eternally it's going to take the Lord to
[51:17] do that for you because there you have
[51:19] to be reached in your soul and that's an
[51:22] area we can't reach I can patch you on
[51:25] the head I can rub your feet and make
[51:27] your body feel good I can I can you know
[51:29] tell you and give you a pep talk and
[51:31] make you feel really good
[51:32] psychologically but to reach the soul
[51:34] that takes him that takes him that takes
[51:38] the word and so we I just wanted to say
[51:41] how very glad I am to have you all I saw
[51:43] this the other night but I was in the
[51:45] back a little obscured I wanted to see
[51:47] it myself how many were here last year
[51:50] raise your hand
[51:52] goodness gracious okay put them down
[51:53] okay so now how many this is your first
[51:56] year
[51:57] wow praise the Lord so y'all last years
[52:00] y'all did a good job on selling it
[52:02] praise the Lord I appreciate that so uh
[52:06] this is our second annual I hope we
[52:09] never have to do another one
[52:11] I hope we're in the Rapture
[52:14] but if we're not the Lord willing we'll
[52:17] be right back here next year and we
[52:19] would love to have all of you again and
[52:24] um you know I want to we're going to to
[52:27] take up an offering in just in a minute
[52:29] and uh and I just wanted to take a few
[52:31] minutes to thank everybody that's made
[52:34] this possible and I can assure you I
[52:36] have been the least contributor it's
[52:39] been a wonderful time for me just to
[52:41] come and be among you and be an observer
[52:45] like you and just pull on the the word
[52:47] of God now I gotta want her to
[52:49] announcements and then I want to come to
[52:51] a couple other quick things and I gotta
[52:53] hurry because Anthony will be pushing on
[52:55] me but
[52:56] but I want to just make an announcement
[52:59] quickly on behalf of all the counselors
[53:01] in security detail there are there's a a
[53:05] pretty good amount
[53:07] um we're getting reports that there's
[53:10] sweaters and hoodies and other garments
[53:13] and even some tech stuff some tablets
[53:17] and things that they have found and so
[53:20] I'm I'm about to get your money I really
[53:22] don't need your items so you need to get
[53:25] your items because don't use that as
[53:28] your offering we're gonna we're gonna
[53:29] get your cash for the offering today so
[53:32] you need to get your items amen and they
[53:35] will be in the lost and found area but
[53:38] that really that's just to tell you
[53:40] they'll be at concessions now you need
[53:43] to know we cannot will not be mailing
[53:46] anything out if we find it and we can
[53:49] find somebody that wants it we'll give
[53:51] it to them it won't get mailed back to
[53:52] you so rummage through your things make
[53:55] sure you've got everything and make sure
[53:57] you take everything because we you know
[54:00] the camps they'll just discard it so
[54:02] we'll try to find a usage for it but
[54:04] what you need to know is you won't be
[54:06] able to get home and say hey can you
[54:08] package up my it's my favorite buddy can
[54:11] you send it to me and we'll say that is
[54:13] on a somebody that we found on the
[54:16] street and they are wearing your hoodie
[54:18] so make sure if you want it you go get
[54:21] it
[54:23] um just a little bit of word and I'm
[54:25] going to need your help and I'm gonna
[54:26] I'm gonna try to really encourage you to
[54:30] in to really go back and take a message
[54:32] back to your parents who probably paid
[54:35] your bill and if they didn't they signed
[54:38] off on you coming or all of the above
[54:40] however you got here this Camp is as far
[54:44] as we know the most expensive Youth Camp
[54:46] in the message
[54:49] I remember back in the day way back in
[54:51] the day there used to be this this
[54:53] television
[54:54] anyway it was a commercial and the the
[54:57] sign was a Curtis Mathis the most
[55:00] expensive television in the world and
[55:03] worth it
[55:04] and I used to go wow
[55:07] someday and then I thought wait a minute
[55:09] you're a Christian what do you want with
[55:10] the TV I don't want a TV but it just
[55:12] impressed me to think man that's bold to
[55:15] say now we are the most expensive but
[55:17] we're worth it you know um this this
[55:20] Camp
[55:21] um because of the facility that we chose
[55:23] we wanted a facility that really would
[55:27] just be over the top and we wanted you
[55:29] to be able to come and have fellowship
[55:32] and you know I want you to know that in
[55:35] my mind your fellowship one among
[55:39] another is half the value the other half
[55:41] to me is that you're coming for the
[55:44] spiritual feast and the food that you're
[55:46] going to get you're breaking natural
[55:48] bread together and spiritual bread
[55:50] together and I just think that is
[55:52] amazing and we thank the Lord for it
[55:55] this Camp is quite expensive for us to
[55:57] rent and we rent the entire thing and
[56:00] they tried to lift our price from last
[56:03] year and we said hey we are already have
[56:05] the highest price in our in our movement
[56:08] and we cannot raise our price and so
[56:10] you're going to have to hold the line
[56:12] raise it on everybody else but leave it
[56:13] the same for us and they did but I can
[56:16] tell you friends I'll just give you a
[56:18] number camps like this at least this
[56:20] Camp runs about ninety thousand dollars
[56:24] to get
[56:29] don't whack it
[56:31] what is it
[56:34] well I'm doing that
[56:38] it still says on okay
[56:40] don't touch okay don't hold it like that
[56:42] all right antenna gate or something
[56:46] so but this Camp runs and that's that's
[56:49] pretty conservative
[56:51] um some of our estimates uh put it up
[56:53] near 100 Grand a year that's with the
[56:55] facility that's with all these golf
[56:58] carts that you've almost got run over by
[56:59] that's with all the the campers that's
[57:02] with everything and so our registration
[57:06] helps to pay for the base costs of the
[57:08] camp but then all of the extraneous
[57:10] expenses and we and we certainly want to
[57:13] make sure that our ministers who have
[57:15] traveled here uh and labored we want to
[57:18] make sure that we know the Labor's
[57:19] worthy of is higher and we want to make
[57:21] sure we're able to give them a very nice
[57:23] offering and thank them for coming and
[57:25] so I just want you to know that we we
[57:29] take up offerings and that's just to
[57:31] help you help us to lose less money
[57:35] because we don't even break even
[57:38] we don't even break even it's not
[57:40] uncommon you might not hear that but if
[57:43] anybody anytime they run a camp I
[57:45] remember years back in the day and the
[57:47] Lima Family Camp they routinely lost ten
[57:50] thousand dollars a year so these are
[57:52] real numbers and you're adults and so I
[57:54] want to give you these real numbers and
[57:56] let you know that that your money is
[57:59] going and the offerings that we take
[58:01] here and the registration you pay I wish
[58:03] we could do it for free that is the
[58:05] absolute truth but we we need your help
[58:08] so go home and make sure your parents
[58:11] know it was money well spent will you do
[58:13] it wait half of you'll do it
[58:16] we do it
[58:19] amen
[58:21] amen
[58:23] now I I want to come to something just

[1:11:20] God bless you
[1:11:22] did everyone sleep well last night
[1:11:25] or is that a bad question to ask at a
[1:11:27] church service
[1:11:29] we're supposed to be honest amen God
[1:11:31] bless you
[1:11:32] let's turn to Zachariah we'll go right
[1:11:35] to the word
[1:11:40] zachariah's at the end of the Old
[1:11:42] Testament just before Malachi
[1:11:46] we appreciate everything that's been
[1:11:48] said and done
[1:11:50] this weekend
[1:11:54] I think some have already may be clocked
[1:11:56] out because it's almost lunch time but
[1:11:58] do we have a little time for the word
[1:12:01] I feel pressured because of the time
[1:12:03] so let's just ask the Lord to help us
[1:12:07] today just to speak what's on his heart
[1:12:10] and not in my notes per se but what he
[1:12:13] would have to say I don't want to say
[1:12:15] too much
[1:12:16] it's time to go
[1:12:19] but we do want to
[1:12:21] let the Lord just
[1:12:23] end his last closing comments that would
[1:12:27] be appropriate heavenly father just
[1:12:30] as we've sang as we've prayed as we've
[1:12:33] been with one another and spoken
[1:12:34] throughout this weekend
[1:12:36] such a wonderful
[1:12:38] atmosphere and presence has been
[1:12:42] we just pray that you would cap off
[1:12:45] these meetings Lord and give us closing
[1:12:47] comments and lingering effects of these
[1:12:50] services
[1:12:52] father we don't know when we leave these
[1:12:55] grounds and we all drive out what will
[1:12:58] happen when we cross over
[1:13:00] that
[1:13:01] line and drive out maybe turn right and
[1:13:04] going down the highway
[1:13:07] we don't know Lord what will happen
[1:13:09] ahead but we commit that to you
[1:13:12] we do desire your personal presence Lord
[1:13:15] to
[1:13:16] speak to us one more time before we
[1:13:18] leave
[1:13:20] settle our hearts
[1:13:22] if there's any sick care that you would
[1:13:24] just
[1:13:25] cause a healing to come over them
[1:13:27] strengthen them we're so thankful for
[1:13:30] last night and the moving of your spirit
[1:13:33] and the healing for all of us Lord
[1:13:36] Lord let us have patience for one
[1:13:38] another whatever you're doing in
[1:13:41] someone's heart we want to be sensitive
[1:13:43] to that today
[1:13:45] but the spirit of Christ get in the word
[1:13:47] now and fill each one of us in Jesus
[1:13:50] Christ's name
[1:13:51] and everyone said
[1:13:54] Zechariah
[1:13:55] chapter 4 verse 6.
[1:14:01] then he answered and spake unto me
[1:14:04] saying
[1:14:06] this is the word of the Lord and to
[1:14:08] zerubbabel saying not by might
[1:14:12] let's read that part all out loud
[1:14:13] together not by might nor by power but
[1:14:18] by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts and
[1:14:22] it speaks in verse 7 about this great
[1:14:24] mountain and how it would become a plane
[1:14:26] and that The Headstone which is Christ
[1:14:29] would come down shouting for the group
[1:14:32] of young people Grace Grace
[1:14:36] that's what we've all heard double Grace
[1:14:39] are we here today you know you all we've
[1:14:42] had a long weekend but if we're going to
[1:14:44] squeeze things in you're going to have
[1:14:46] to help today amen can we do that don't
[1:14:48] worry I was up till 1 30 in the morning
[1:14:50] too amen so
[1:14:52] we didn't come here to sleep
[1:14:54] so we came here to to get in the spirit
[1:14:57] so that we can uh just hit the channel
[1:15:01] are you thankful for Grace moreover the
[1:15:05] word of the Lord came unto me saying the
[1:15:07] hands of zerubbabel have laid the
[1:15:09] foundation of this message this house
[1:15:13] his hands his hands
[1:15:16] shall also finish it and thou shalt know
[1:15:19] that the Lord of hosts had sent me unto
[1:15:22] you the verse 10 the first line is where
[1:15:25] we're taking our thought today
[1:15:27] for who hath despised the day of small
[1:15:32] things
[1:15:33] or other ver other versions of this same
[1:15:36] scripture would say despise not the days
[1:15:40] of Small Beginnings
[1:15:43] despise not the days of Small Beginnings
[1:15:47] can you turn to First Timothy
[1:15:54] chapter 4 verse 11.
[1:15:58] isn't his presence so wonderful
[1:16:01] he's just so wonderful to us
[1:16:06] First Timothy
[1:16:07] chapter 4
[1:16:11] verse 11 and 12 and you sounded so good
[1:16:13] why don't we read these verses out loud
[1:16:15] together Paul speaking to brother
[1:16:18] Timothy that was a young man in the
[1:16:19] message
[1:16:21] these things command and teach
[1:16:25] let no man despise thy youth but be thou
[1:16:29] an example of the Believers in word in
[1:16:33] conversation in charity in spirit in
[1:16:37] faith and impurity verse 12 says let no
[1:16:41] man
[1:16:42] despise thy youth
[1:16:44] and I want to take that out of Zechariah
[1:16:47] despise not the days of Small Beginnings
[1:16:50] and let no man despise thy youth
[1:16:54] we want to speak this morning on where
[1:16:56] are you going
[1:16:58] where are you going
[1:17:01] after we end these meetings and
[1:17:03] and even our future
[1:17:06] where are you going
[1:17:08] God bless you you can have your seats
[1:17:10] and the brothers could bring up our
[1:17:12] first slide
[1:17:43] yeah
[1:17:45] I see
[1:17:47] someone falling
[1:17:49] this morning
[1:17:54] I see them falling
[1:18:00] down through a place where it seems like
[1:18:02] there's no bottom to it
[1:18:06] it seems like a place and they catch
[1:18:10] themselves because they had been living
[1:18:12] before but now they're in another place
[1:18:16] called the regions of the Lost
[1:18:21] and they're falling
[1:18:24] and they cry out oh no
[1:18:27] I'm lost
[1:18:32] and they just begin to think about their
[1:18:34] life that they lived on earth
[1:18:37] because they have been raised in the
[1:18:39] message
[1:18:41] they actually were the son of a minister
[1:18:45] but now they've come to a place and it's
[1:18:47] very sad to say this almost a paradox
[1:18:50] that you could be in this kind of frame
[1:18:53] of mind falling through a dark place
[1:18:56] but they're actually laughing
[1:18:59] it's a hideous laugh of discomfort
[1:19:04] as they're falling falling into this
[1:19:06] regions of the Lost
[1:19:10] and they begin to think about when they
[1:19:12] were living and why that why didn't I
[1:19:15] respond
[1:19:17] when I had the chance why didn't I
[1:19:19] respond at the altar call see it wasn't
[1:19:22] funny then it wasn't a moment that they
[1:19:25] were just that they could reach back for
[1:19:27] we can't roll back the tape
[1:19:30] today we're speaking about where are we
[1:19:32] going because it's very important as a
[1:19:34] young person to make decisions why we're
[1:19:37] alive
[1:19:39] and this young man is falling he's
[1:19:41] falling into a place and why didn't I
[1:19:43] respond when I had to call
[1:19:47] I helped my father and so many prayer
[1:19:50] lines
[1:19:51] so many times of services and meetings
[1:19:54] and I was actually very close to him and
[1:19:57] helped him
[1:19:59] I saw miracles
[1:20:02] with my own eyes
[1:20:05] I actually saw blind eyes come open
[1:20:09] I saw deaf ears people that couldn't
[1:20:12] hear just come open in a moment I saw
[1:20:15] people that were crippled
[1:20:16] started walking again I saw people that
[1:20:19] were dumb start talking and and being
[1:20:22] able to speak again I was there I I saw
[1:20:25] healings
[1:20:28] I'm a personal Witness
[1:20:30] of healings and miracles
[1:20:33] even shoutings I mean so many meetings I
[1:20:35] was in how many services have we heard
[1:20:38] how many songs
[1:20:40] have we heard sung
[1:20:43] and as he'd just be falling and even
[1:20:46] people raised from the dead I remember
[1:20:48] them coming back to life again and
[1:20:50] he I was personally
[1:20:53] able to see the angel of the Lord
[1:20:57] it's pretty incredible this young man in
[1:20:59] this state
[1:21:00] and his life that he had lived and to
[1:21:03] see the angel of the Lord and he begins
[1:21:06] to think where did I fail
[1:21:09] after all of that after all of this
[1:21:13] where did I fail
[1:21:16] why didn't I respond
[1:21:18] appropriately in that season I mean you
[1:21:22] know today there's a lot of people that
[1:21:24] are always looking to put an excuse or
[1:21:26] put a blame on why they're in their
[1:21:29] place and
[1:21:30] but she was honest he said it it wasn't
[1:21:33] my father's fault
[1:21:37] it wasn't my mother's fault
[1:21:40] it wasn't my upbringing even though I
[1:21:42] had a very rough upbringing my first
[1:21:45] mother my mother she died when I was
[1:21:48] just very young my father had to raise
[1:21:51] me as a little baby with a bottles under
[1:21:55] his arms to keep them warm at night and
[1:21:59] I remember one time looking out in the
[1:22:01] clouds and seeing a cloud go by and
[1:22:04] crying out to my daddy is is Mommy up
[1:22:07] there
[1:22:09] did Jesus take my mommy
[1:22:13] and this is all flooding through his
[1:22:15] mind as he's falling and falling and
[1:22:18] he's into this place
[1:22:21] but I can't give excuse because of my
[1:22:23] upbringing
[1:22:25] I actually started smoking when I was a
[1:22:28] young man
[1:22:30] I was drinking
[1:22:32] I was gambling which was illegal there
[1:22:35] in Indiana and Ohio and Kentucky it was
[1:22:38] illegal it became so bad my father made
[1:22:42] me live and moved to my grandparents
[1:22:45] house
[1:22:47] but as he's falling now and going
[1:22:49] through this he's beginning to think of
[1:22:51] how he was raised and how his father
[1:22:54] had to travel so much in the ministry
[1:22:58] see his father had sacrificed
[1:23:01] his youth to minister to other young
[1:23:04] people and other families and other
[1:23:07] churches in the message
[1:23:09] and this young man but he didn't use
[1:23:11] that for an excuse that his father had
[1:23:14] taken the gospel to many others he
[1:23:17] actually it became very personal what is
[1:23:20] my excuse
[1:23:23] and you begin to think about how he
[1:23:25] would saw a lot in the message because
[1:23:27] he was very close
[1:23:29] to a lot of things in the message he had
[1:23:32] seen a lot of hypocrites
[1:23:35] he had seen a lot of liars
[1:23:38] seen a lot of fakes and
[1:23:42] things that had happened in fact some of
[1:23:44] those that were close to his father's
[1:23:46] Ministry it turned out to be homosexuals
[1:23:51] it's incredible how men and women can be
[1:23:54] so close to the real thing
[1:23:56] and be so lost
[1:24:00] it's amazing how men and women can be
[1:24:03] all around the moving of the spirit and
[1:24:05] right around where God's doing great
[1:24:08] things
[1:24:09] and yet be lost
[1:24:12] and be far away from God
[1:24:15] and have a profession
[1:24:18] and yet be so empty
[1:24:22] but I have no excuse
[1:24:25] why am I in this place why am I in this
[1:24:28] dilemma
[1:24:30] and we're going to hear in just a few
[1:24:32] minutes by God's Amazing Grace
[1:24:34] God brought this young man out of that
[1:24:37] place and saved his soul
[1:24:41] somebody say praise be to God
[1:24:44] thank you Jesus
[1:24:47] now if we would go to our next slide
[1:24:49] here and we begin to see
[1:24:53] Zechariah Chapter 4 I want you to just
[1:24:55] listen real closely and quickly in your
[1:24:58] heart
[1:25:00] as the Bible begins to speak about this
[1:25:03] Grace Grace that came in that time but
[1:25:06] it was also a prophecy of our time
[1:25:10] in verse 10 the prophet prophesied about
[1:25:13] who hath despised the day of small
[1:25:16] things
[1:25:19] who have despised
[1:25:21] the days of small things
[1:25:23] in other words don't despise
[1:25:26] the days of Small Beginnings
[1:25:30] I'm thinking of you today young people
[1:25:33] I'm thinking of you even as we go home
[1:25:35] from this camp and what God had started
[1:25:39] a good thing in our lives
[1:25:42] but the lingering effects and just
[1:25:45] excuse me for my voice is straining it
[1:25:47] was already gone before the prayer line
[1:25:49] last night
[1:25:50] be perfectly honest
[1:25:53] aren't you glad for the Holy Spirit
[1:25:58] but the lingering effects of these type
[1:26:01] of services
[1:26:03] should be a further consecrated life
[1:26:05] with Jesus Christ
[1:26:08] it should be something that lingers long
[1:26:10] after
[1:26:12] the last beat of the drums or the last
[1:26:15] song special or the last goodbye and the
[1:26:18] text from our friends and the
[1:26:19] testimonies begin to come in days after
[1:26:22] the meetings there the lingering effects
[1:26:26] should be something that sticks much
[1:26:28] closer than just the noise of the crowd
[1:26:32] and the voice of the minister
[1:26:35] it ought to be a daily love relationship
[1:26:39] with Jesus Christ
[1:26:41] I was listening to brother Branham as he
[1:26:44] prayed one of his last prayers with a
[1:26:48] group of young people
[1:26:49] and it was I spoke to Rebecca Smith
[1:26:52] Branham
[1:26:53] about this certain service come follow
[1:26:56] me and I called her when I was a young
[1:26:58] person and ask her and she described the
[1:27:01] setting and her friend Marilyn was also
[1:27:04] graduating and it was in a home and you
[1:27:07] can hear that and come follow me after
[1:27:09] the seals brother by Adam's closing the
[1:27:12] service
[1:27:14] and it's like he cried out Lord Jesus
[1:27:17] youth
[1:27:19] men and women for tomorrow if there is a
[1:27:23] tomorrow
[1:27:24] we must train them Lord
[1:27:27] we feel that burden to train them like
[1:27:32] there will be a tomorrow if there is not
[1:27:35] then today
[1:27:37] is the day
[1:27:39] now that was 1963. that was after the
[1:27:43] Angels came down and after brother
[1:27:44] Branham said publicly I remember what
[1:27:47] was said about and especially about the
[1:27:49] young people now he's praying with young
[1:27:52] people he's given them his last prayer
[1:27:55] and he's speaking about the youth and
[1:27:57] how that there was a burden on his heart
[1:28:00] to train them
[1:28:03] to speak a word that would would not
[1:28:06] just be for the moment
[1:28:08] but it would carry carry on into the
[1:28:12] days and months and can we say the years
[1:28:15] to follow
[1:28:16] that there would be another generation
[1:28:18] raise up that would say though I wasn't
[1:28:20] in that room though I never knew him as
[1:28:23] a as a man as a prophet but I know the
[1:28:26] Lord Jesus Christ I wonder how many
[1:28:29] people in this room today can raise your
[1:28:31] hand and say you're thankful for that
[1:28:33] type of a message
[1:28:37] old and young alike that would come to
[1:28:39] us and say despise not the days
[1:28:42] of Small Beginnings
[1:28:45] and when we look at the next slide and
[1:28:47] conceive
[1:28:49] First Timothy chapter 4.
[1:28:52] this is now Paul picking up the words
[1:28:55] in in the New Testament
[1:28:58] these things command and teach
[1:29:01] to let no man despise thy youth
[1:29:06] but be thou an example of the Believers
[1:29:09] he wasn't talking to the older
[1:29:11] generation he's talking to young people
[1:29:15] he's speaking to you today
[1:29:18] how many open up your Bible
[1:29:20] and read it like it was God speaking to
[1:29:22] you now how many do that I
[1:29:24] wow about a quarter of you
[1:29:27] how many open up your Bible and read it
[1:29:29] like it was God speaking to you
[1:29:32] I want to speak to you like that today
[1:29:34] let no man despise your youth
[1:29:39] but you be the example of the Believers
[1:29:43] in word and conversation that's your
[1:29:46] behavior
[1:29:47] in your charity or in the love of Christ
[1:29:51] in the message in the spirit in your
[1:29:55] faith and in purity
[1:29:57] you carry the torch young people you be
[1:30:01] the reason why God sent a prophet
[1:30:05] don't drop the ball
[1:30:08] don't drop the Baton
[1:30:11] and when you look at these words let no
[1:30:15] man despise it means they will condemn
[1:30:18] you they will seek to disdain you
[1:30:21] and to look down on you
[1:30:23] they will think little of you or nothing
[1:30:27] of you you're just nothing
[1:30:30] daily they look on you with disdain
[1:30:35] they think you're a horrible person
[1:30:39] I feel like shouting this out I know
[1:30:41] you're quiet this this morning it's
[1:30:43] almost this afternoon but there is a
[1:30:46] spirit today that thinks the young
[1:30:49] people are just horrible they're doing
[1:30:51] bad they're they're just slowly they're
[1:30:54] little and we've heard from two
[1:30:55] scriptures and I'll add a third one in
[1:30:57] Titus Chapter 2 verse 15 Paul speaking
[1:31:01] to Titus let no man despise thee
[1:31:07] they will
[1:31:08] but don't let it affect you
[1:31:12] when Paul said let no man despise your
[1:31:15] youth that doesn't mean when people
[1:31:17] despise you and disdain you and think
[1:31:19] you're too little and you're too young
[1:31:20] to do anything that you're supposed to
[1:31:23] stop them and you know text back and
[1:31:25] email back no no that's not what he's
[1:31:27] saying let no man despise your youth
[1:31:30] that we're supposed to get all militant
[1:31:32] our last service before we all go back
[1:31:35] home is like a Jihad of the young people
[1:31:38] of the message and
[1:31:40] that's not what he's saying
[1:31:44] Paul Was preparing the new generation
[1:31:46] for what would come
[1:31:48] that they will disdain you
[1:31:50] they will despise you
[1:31:53] because you are a youth
[1:31:56] because you are younger
[1:31:59] because you are littler
[1:32:02] I'm speaking to someone today and
[1:32:03] because you're just beginning in your
[1:32:06] Christian Life or because you're smaller
[1:32:08] not just physically but spiritually they
[1:32:11] will speak negative about you
[1:32:15] but I'm here today to speak to your
[1:32:18] hearts don't let their attitude affect
[1:32:20] you
[1:32:21] I'm speaking the message I'm speaking
[1:32:23] what Zechariah said I'm speaking what
[1:32:26] Paul said I mean speaking what William
[1:32:28] Branham said don't look down on yourself
[1:32:33] and Friends it really starts from
[1:32:35] ourselves and every age every age
[1:32:38] bracket is is a Afflicted with certain
[1:32:43] spirits that try to
[1:32:45] cause them to become non-effective and
[1:32:48] and we're living in a day where Satan is
[1:32:50] pushing down and trying to stop your
[1:32:53] voice
[1:32:55] I think it's amazing the very thing that
[1:32:57] we've been raised up for and trained to
[1:33:00] do
[1:33:01] when it comes to that time of you being
[1:33:05] manifested
[1:33:06] how quick you're squashed
[1:33:10] how so quick you're disdained and looked
[1:33:13] down on and
[1:33:15] that's exactly what Paul was saying
[1:33:17] don't let that happen to you
[1:33:21] just because you've just started the
[1:33:23] racer just been saved or received the
[1:33:26] Holy Spirit just because you are
[1:33:29] beginning
[1:33:31] don't be moved by the negative
[1:33:35] we live in a very depressing age
[1:33:38] in fact depression is a global pandemic
[1:33:42] for young people
[1:33:45] the anxieties and pressure of the day
[1:33:49] that we've been called to live in
[1:33:52] it's more than any other age
[1:33:57] do we all agree
[1:33:59] so don't let the despising of Satan when
[1:34:02] you're when it's your time to rise it's
[1:34:04] your time to be manifested that you
[1:34:07] allow spirits to come in
[1:34:10] to try to cancel
[1:34:13] what God's called you to do
[1:34:16] it's very real they call it a cancer
[1:34:19] culture that's in the world
[1:34:22] it's in politics
[1:34:24] it's in business that if someone's
[1:34:26] rising up you just speak negative about
[1:34:28] them you slander them
[1:34:31] and because we've been around longer and
[1:34:33] in an establishment you know all the
[1:34:34] startups and all the youth and the new
[1:34:36] generation just stop them it's if
[1:34:39] they're coming across different than the
[1:34:41] way you they just squash you cancel you
[1:34:44] they want to pull the plug on you
[1:34:47] today the holy spirit is saying that
[1:34:49] because that same spirit will creach
[1:34:51] right creep right into the message
[1:34:55] amongst carnal message believers
[1:34:58] and will sense to squash your life
[1:35:01] squash your testimony
[1:35:04] seek to cancel out what God's called you
[1:35:06] to be
[1:35:08] and I'm here today to encourage you as
[1:35:10] your brethren Christ let no one despise
[1:35:14] your youth
[1:35:17] [Applause]
[1:35:25] as we speak now and go a little bit
[1:35:27] further we've got to move along
[1:35:30] this we spoke about the regions of the
[1:35:33] lost I want you to remember
[1:35:37] they can't get out
[1:35:41] but you can
[1:35:43] they have no opportunity to roll back
[1:35:46] the tape
[1:35:48] and put their car in reverse and come
[1:35:50] back down look out Lodge
[1:35:53] we can't do Saturday night over again
[1:36:00] we can't sit here Saturday morning and
[1:36:02] see a skit
[1:36:04] of our peers and brothers and sisters
[1:36:06] that labor to bring across the message
[1:36:10] and that is that if three Hebrew
[1:36:13] children can do that then so can you
[1:36:18] that's what I heard that's the message I
[1:36:21] heard and Friends it it's gonna be the
[1:36:23] word that gets us in the rapture
[1:36:26] it's going to be the word that we
[1:36:28] receive as young people and feed on
[1:36:30] daily when we leave this Camp that's
[1:36:33] going to give you rapturing faith
[1:36:36] and my heart is stirred again today
[1:36:39] because I believe a true evidence of a
[1:36:42] true experience
[1:36:43] and an encounter with God
[1:36:46] will be manifested after the great
[1:36:49] weekend
[1:36:51] the real evidence of an experience with
[1:36:55] God is after the meetings
[1:37:00] if you want to really know whether the
[1:37:03] experience that you received
[1:37:05] was really real and truly from the Lord
[1:37:10] how do how does it cause your life to
[1:37:13] live when you go home
[1:37:16] and I know this is different I know
[1:37:18] we're not clapping I know we're not
[1:37:19] standing
[1:37:21] but these are the final words
[1:37:24] before we go out there friends
[1:37:28] and face our fire
[1:37:30] and face the rejection
[1:37:32] and face what all of us are going to
[1:37:34] have to go through as Believers there's
[1:37:37] got to be an experience that keeps us
[1:37:40] not just during the meetings and when
[1:37:43] we're with our friends and
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:52] God help us today to really
[1:37:55] not question our experience but really
[1:37:57] ask ourselves as we come into the last
[1:38:00] part of the message and the ministry
[1:38:02] that you would say the third pool or
[1:38:04] look at Jesus's Ministry and how he
[1:38:07] demonstrated his life at that season
[1:38:12] when she was rejected when he was
[1:38:15] crucified
[1:38:18] when brother Branham came to the end of
[1:38:20] his ministry in third pool and end of
[1:38:22] his life
[1:38:24] when ten thousand of his friends left
[1:38:26] and
[1:38:28] when he moved to Arizona and they didn't
[1:38:31] even want to have him come preach in
[1:38:33] their churches they had squashed him out
[1:38:35] they they had really canceled him
[1:38:38] we don't want you we don't want your
[1:38:40] message
[1:38:43] and families in the message were being
[1:38:46] raised up that had little boys and girls
[1:38:48] and they were riding their bicycles
[1:38:49] around on Sunday morning and they didn't
[1:38:52] have a home church and brother Brandon
[1:38:53] was so happy when brother Perry green
[1:38:56] opened up his church
[1:38:59] so that our children aren't riding their
[1:39:01] bicycles around
[1:39:02] on a Sunday
[1:39:05] in other words we're so happy that the
[1:39:07] word can meet them at this time of their
[1:39:10] life and they can receive strength and
[1:39:12] we can be together
[1:39:15] but brother Branham had communion
[1:39:18] and within weeks
[1:39:20] he's in a a tragic we would say accident
[1:39:24] but it was God saying
[1:39:26] this generation is ready
[1:39:29] the message is ready
[1:39:31] to make it without the prophet being
[1:39:34] alive
[1:39:36] it was a global declaration
[1:39:41] and nobody liked it no one in the
[1:39:43] message liked it no one agreed our
[1:39:45] Prophet our Prophet where do we go from
[1:39:48] here
[1:39:49] but God like pulled the plug and he said
[1:39:52] no it's time for there to be churches
[1:39:54] all over the world
[1:39:56] it's time for there to be youth groups
[1:39:58] and meetings and services all over the
[1:40:00] world let's take it to Africa let's take
[1:40:03] it to China let's take it to Europe
[1:40:05] [Applause]
[1:40:12] what we were speaking about earlier was
[1:40:14] actually brother branham's son
[1:40:17] brother Billy Paul Branham and I have a
[1:40:19] photo here on the screen and I just want
[1:40:21] to go through this just a little bit
[1:40:23] that maybe it'll affect someone
[1:40:26] as you see the next slide this photo was
[1:40:28] taken
[1:40:30] in 1946 and Billy Paul at this age would
[1:40:33] have been about 11 years old
[1:40:36] and the next slide you see he would have
[1:40:38] just fit right into a South Carolina
[1:40:41] youth camp
[1:40:44] brother by Adam was talking about that
[1:40:46] in Oregon in the next slide and he was
[1:40:49] talking about Billy Paul
[1:40:52] when he was 14 years old
[1:40:55] and you can read what's on the screen
[1:40:57] but before I sent him down to the Bible
[1:40:59] school he was in the common school and
[1:41:01] did not have a very good background all
[1:41:04] the children girls and boys smoking
[1:41:08] and carrying on
[1:41:10] you say what did Brother Branham do
[1:41:13] when he found out his teenage son was
[1:41:16] smoking
[1:41:18] you can see in the next slide he moved
[1:41:21] Billy Paul it's about a 13 or 14 hour
[1:41:24] drive from Jeffersonville from Indiana
[1:41:26] to Waxahachie you can see on the right
[1:41:30] hand side I'm sorry
[1:41:35] you can see North Carolina where brother
[1:41:36] Josh is from you can see South Carolina
[1:41:38] where we are in Tennessee where some of
[1:41:41] you are in Kentucky where some of you
[1:41:43] are from you can see different places
[1:41:45] out even to Arizona where some of you
[1:41:48] are from but watch where brother Branham
[1:41:51] moved his Sundown too
[1:41:54] when he realized his son was smoking
[1:41:58] he talks about it like this further in
[1:42:01] that message when my boy Billy about 14
[1:42:03] years old
[1:42:05] before I sent him down to the Bible
[1:42:07] school and he was in the common school
[1:42:09] and did not have a very good background
[1:42:10] all the children girls and boys smoking
[1:42:13] and carrying on and one day I came into
[1:42:16] the house and sat down Billy was staying
[1:42:18] with his grandmother
[1:42:20] and while the presence of the Lord was
[1:42:22] near there was a vision I seen my boy
[1:42:24] with a cigarette in his hand and that
[1:42:27] like to killed me
[1:42:29] so after a while his bicycle stopped out
[1:42:32] front and he came in and said hello Dad
[1:42:34] and running through his arms around me
[1:42:36] and I took him in my hands and I said
[1:42:38] Billy when did you start this
[1:42:41] he said what Daddy he said I said
[1:42:43] smoking he said I don't I I said don't
[1:42:47] tell me you do smoke Billy and he
[1:42:50] started crying
[1:42:53] I couldn't keep from it
[1:42:56] brother Branham said I went on down to
[1:42:59] the bathroom
[1:43:01] and I sat down out there and I cried
[1:43:03] like a baby
[1:43:04] and I thought his mother and glory and
[1:43:07] last thing she said to me take care of
[1:43:09] Billy
[1:43:10] and here I've tried to put the example
[1:43:12] before him to see him do a thing like
[1:43:15] that it almost killed me
[1:43:17] so I took him out on a walk and I said
[1:43:19] son you're coming away from there right
[1:43:22] away right now I'm I'm gonna send you to
[1:43:25] Bible school no matter how Lonesome you
[1:43:26] get and I said I want you to stretch out
[1:43:28] your arms like this
[1:43:30] and he did he said what's the matter I
[1:43:33] said this is left and this is right
[1:43:36] and you cannot be going both ways at the
[1:43:39] same time you're in the shape of a cross
[1:43:42] and I said as long as you're going to
[1:43:44] going right you may think you're going
[1:43:46] wrong but you've got to come out right
[1:43:48] you can't go east and west at the same
[1:43:50] time you can't be doing right and wrong
[1:43:53] at the same time
[1:43:56] and he goes on to speak about that
[1:43:57] sometimes people are going wrong
[1:43:59] thinking they're doing right and it'll
[1:44:02] wind up wrong no matter it goes on to
[1:44:04] talk about that your duty to God
[1:44:12] how did Brother Branham deal
[1:44:14] with these things with his own family
[1:44:16] when his own son
[1:44:18] here I have a picture of the very that's
[1:44:20] amazing brother Brandon would preach so
[1:44:22] much against Bible schools and colleges
[1:44:25] and he sent his own son to one
[1:44:28] and he wanted Rebecca his daughter to go
[1:44:31] to Ashbury College in Kentucky I just
[1:44:34] think that's amazing
[1:44:36] you can see this very place
[1:44:39] I just wanted to make it more real is
[1:44:42] this okay today
[1:44:44] this is the actual place this is where
[1:44:45] brother Branham sent his teenage son
[1:44:50] trying to help him trying to realize
[1:44:53] that he's in a place
[1:44:55] this is his mother and father and
[1:44:58] little sister next slide
[1:45:02] and brother Branham goes on to say it
[1:45:03] like this a dose of Medicine
[1:45:06] almost killed my boy
[1:45:09] this is another message come let us
[1:45:11] reason together I just
[1:45:13] somebody say thank you Jesus amen
[1:45:16] I was in my room on
[1:45:20] Friday or Saturday and I was just asking
[1:45:22] the Lord what message I should listen to
[1:45:26] what message out of the whole message
[1:45:29] to prepare my heart just for the weekend
[1:45:32] and this was the very message that
[1:45:36] he put into my heart I started listening
[1:45:38] to it
[1:45:40] it was after Friday night because I I
[1:45:43] needed just confirmation that this
[1:45:45] morning was the way he wanted me to go
[1:45:46] and it came across this very quote and I
[1:45:49] thought Lord that's in my notes
[1:45:52] come let us reason come
[1:45:56] let us reason together let's talk about
[1:45:59] this
[1:46:00] I mean where are you going
[1:46:03] you say but we've had great meetings and
[1:46:05] I've seen Miracles and I've seen a
[1:46:08] people that were dead like this week
[1:46:12] dead and last night they came alive I
[1:46:15] mean I heard a testimony as I'm walking
[1:46:18] in here of a young man that his father
[1:46:20] had never seen him raising his hands and
[1:46:23] and yesterday he's racing his hands and
[1:46:27] [Applause]
[1:46:36] and you know there's a relationship that
[1:46:38] happens spiritually
[1:46:40] between the older generation and Young
[1:46:42] Generation when we all begin to
[1:46:43] surrender to the Lord that doesn't
[1:46:45] always have to be a Clash
[1:46:49] and the transition in the time of and
[1:46:51] I'm going to go to that and just after
[1:46:53] this but in the time of passing off the
[1:46:56] Baton is usually when it's dropped
[1:46:59] and the message is in a time of
[1:47:00] transition
[1:47:02] but it always doesn't have to be just
[1:47:05] hitting heads and
[1:47:08] like where are you coming from and if it
[1:47:10] is sometimes when we're with people like
[1:47:13] where are you coming from we just need
[1:47:15] to ask the Lord to help us
[1:47:19] because sometimes it's not always the
[1:47:21] way that you're looking at it is the
[1:47:23] right way
[1:47:25] let me give you an example how many know
[1:47:27] that we're at a youth camp
[1:47:31] at a youth camp the music is faster
[1:47:35] there can be drums on the platform
[1:47:38] there's a lot of noise
[1:47:41] but if we would have a seniors couples
[1:47:44] meeting weekend
[1:47:48] there probably wouldn't be drums on the
[1:47:49] platform they'll probably even be loud
[1:47:51] music
[1:47:54] the last scheduled event would be eight
[1:47:56] o'clock they're all they're shutting
[1:47:58] down good night everybody
[1:48:00] good night everybody they don't have a
[1:48:03] bonfire at 10 o'clock
[1:48:05] they're not up to one in the morning
[1:48:07] they have no struggle turning out the
[1:48:10] light at 1 30 saying with you please
[1:48:12] shut off the light they're already gone
[1:48:14] the lights are out and
[1:48:18] right and there's no 7 30 rise and shine
[1:48:21] it's we'll just get up and have coffee
[1:48:23] I'll see you at 10 o'clock you know
[1:48:28] I'm not speaking negatively I'm just
[1:48:30] letting you know that young people are
[1:48:32] different
[1:48:33] we think different
[1:48:35] the new generation's different and if
[1:48:37] we're not careful that can be a Clash
[1:48:41] it can be a breakage in a relationship
[1:48:43] it can cause a young man to want to run
[1:48:46] away
[1:48:50] it can cause a young lady to pant for
[1:48:53] Freedom so much
[1:48:55] that she wants to go she'll crawl out
[1:48:58] her window she'll literally crawl out on
[1:49:00] an upstairs window and go down
[1:49:03] and go out with her boyfriend
[1:49:06] or her friends
[1:49:11] we're young people
[1:49:13] I'm speaking to young people
[1:49:16] that's not a sin
[1:49:18] it's not wrong for a young lady
[1:49:22] to desire a young man or a young man to
[1:49:24] desire or have a thirst for a young lady
[1:49:27] that's not sinful
[1:49:29] and sex is not bad
[1:49:32] sex is not evil
[1:49:34] but there's a time that you wait until
[1:49:36] you're married that is the right time
[1:49:38] and fornication is not of God
[1:49:42] fornication if you look up the word in
[1:49:44] the scripture is actually purnia
[1:49:46] pornography and it's it's Satan by the
[1:49:49] World Wide Web
[1:49:51] has achieved his Global gospel
[1:49:55] and he has pulled in The Souls of men
[1:49:59] and women
[1:50:00] and he has sold them for nothing
[1:50:03] and he will walk them up and throw them
[1:50:06] into a corner after a midnight fling and
[1:50:09] after you know following your pleasure
[1:50:11] and and take your virginity
[1:50:16] and there's no remorse
[1:50:20] he'll just move right to the next person
[1:50:22] he'll put a shot in your alcohol and you
[1:50:24] thought it was a Coke and you're just
[1:50:26] having a good time in a simple little
[1:50:28] dance and a simple little party and a
[1:50:30] simple and it'll ruin your life and
[1:50:32] plague you all the way to the time that
[1:50:35] you're married and have grandchildren
[1:50:37] and have the Holy Ghost
[1:50:45] God help all of us
[1:50:47] and it was in that season of a brother
[1:50:50] that had a lot more opportunity
[1:50:53] and in the presence of God than than you
[1:50:55] and I
[1:50:58] ever had or will
[1:51:00] he was right next to his father he was
[1:51:02] he helped him in the prayer lines he he
[1:51:05] was at altar cause
[1:51:08] one time brother Branham
[1:51:10] got permission that Billy Paul would see
[1:51:12] the angel of the Lord
[1:51:14] and brother Branham had a pillow over
[1:51:16] Billy Paul's head how many know this is
[1:51:18] true and he said can I let him see the
[1:51:21] angel of the Lord
[1:51:23] and because he helps me in the meetings
[1:51:27] and he said now Billy I'm going to take
[1:51:29] this pillow off your head and when you
[1:51:31] look he's going to be standing right
[1:51:32] over in that corner
[1:51:40] about two or three years ago Billy Paul
[1:51:43] got into a habit got running around
[1:51:45] there and that's the reason I had to
[1:51:47] send him to Waxahachie to the school our
[1:51:50] public school with a bunch of little
[1:51:52] boys and things and all smoking
[1:51:53] cigarettes and things and Billy come up
[1:51:56] home one day and said how are you
[1:51:57] getting along Daddy
[1:52:00] and I seen a vision
[1:52:02] pop over him now
[1:52:04] I know that we're speaking at a youth
[1:52:06] meeting
[1:52:07] but we do have adults here and some
[1:52:09] fathers and mothers that will come later
[1:52:11] grandparents but let me say something
[1:52:14] if brother branham's family had these
[1:52:16] same issues going on and he was the
[1:52:19] prophet to the age
[1:52:21] I think all of us need to just recognize
[1:52:24] that Satan is no respecter of any person
[1:52:31] [Applause]
[1:52:37] you say well if brother Branham was a
[1:52:39] good father if brother Branham had a
[1:52:41] good mother
[1:52:42] media came along and and was brother
[1:52:45] branham's second wife after sister hope
[1:52:48] passed away but he'd say well if he was
[1:52:50] a good home if they would have went to a
[1:52:52] good church if he would have been in a
[1:52:53] good atmosphere I don't know how much
[1:52:55] better you can get than a prophet being
[1:52:57] your father
[1:53:05] then do you think one of our young
[1:53:06] people could not just be tempted
[1:53:11] but actually go there
[1:53:14] do you think that we're so spiritual
[1:53:16] have we become so in our in our minds uh
[1:53:20] made such a culture in the message
[1:53:23] of what church you go to or who's your
[1:53:26] pastor do you go to these certain type
[1:53:28] of meetings or who's the preachers have
[1:53:31] we made that such a culture
[1:53:34] that we would be so naive to think that
[1:53:37] someone that could be around the
[1:53:39] supernatural so close
[1:53:48] you know what it is today people don't
[1:53:50] want to admit it
[1:53:52] people don't want to admit that there's
[1:53:54] issues in their family they don't want
[1:53:56] to admit that our young men or our young
[1:53:58] lady or the even older ones parents
[1:54:01] aren't willing to say I am wrong
[1:54:04] they're not willing to say father and
[1:54:06] mother when we were married that wasn't
[1:54:08] our first time to be together
[1:54:18] so you shouldn't be talking about these
[1:54:20] things at youth meetings or especially
[1:54:22] the last service we're supposed to have
[1:54:24] a rah-rah and let's all leave on a high
[1:54:26] note we are going to leave on a high
[1:54:28] note
[1:54:29] we're going to leave with a type of
[1:54:30] service that is affecting you Tuesday
[1:54:33] and Thursday and two weeks from now
[1:54:35] you're gonna say oh God
[1:54:45] so they were smoking in things and
[1:54:47] and a vision popped up over Billy Paul
[1:54:51] next slide I said come here a minute I
[1:54:53] talked to you he said what is it Daddy
[1:54:59] he didn't say oh man he
[1:55:01] Oh Daddy
[1:55:04] I know Dad like I've been around
[1:55:08] I've been in the meetings
[1:55:13] so he got into a habit got to running
[1:55:15] around and things
[1:55:20] he lied to his father
[1:55:23] he said I'm not when he why are you
[1:55:25] smoking cigarettes I'm not
[1:55:27] I said don't lie to me Billy
[1:55:35] and he commenced to crying
[1:55:38] well he said I won't do it no more daddy
[1:55:40] and he went on out he kept on doing it
[1:55:42] and he he wasn't hiding it he can't hide
[1:55:44] it no no so I seen a vision and the Lord
[1:55:47] showed me that Billy had disobeyed me
[1:55:52] and had jumped through a window and was
[1:55:55] La going laughing
[1:55:58] Head Over Heels like that
[1:56:00] down through eternity
[1:56:03] turning over and over
[1:56:06] that's how we started the service
[1:56:10] he's going over and over and he's
[1:56:13] falling into this place
[1:56:15] and when I came out of the vision I was
[1:56:18] screaming
[1:56:21] boy we need some of that passion back
[1:56:23] into our our lives and in our families
[1:56:26] when one of our loved ones or one of
[1:56:28] someone that's been in our prayers and
[1:56:31] we see them going wayward
[1:56:34] it ought not to be well they're not part
[1:56:36] of our group
[1:56:39] well you know you know you always reap
[1:56:42] what your sowing
[1:56:43] the way the transgressor is hard and yep
[1:56:47] they're just reaping
[1:56:49] until it's your friend
[1:56:51] until it's your brother your sister
[1:56:55] come on friends I'm
[1:56:58] sometimes we can claim to be so
[1:57:00] spiritual
[1:57:01] and we fail to Face Reality where the
[1:57:05] rubber meets the road
[1:57:08] and when he came out of the vision
[1:57:14] when he came out of the vision of really
[1:57:16] where they were at
[1:57:19] he didn't say oh bless God you know he
[1:57:22] saved he's my son
[1:57:24] he goes to the Branham Tabernacle you
[1:57:26] know he'll be there
[1:57:30] when he came out of a vision
[1:57:33] he was screaming
[1:57:36] oh God
[1:57:44] oh God
[1:57:49] I wonder sometimes if we just catch a
[1:57:51] little glimpse
[1:57:52] of something that's going on that we
[1:57:54] just kind of change and go into a fast
[1:57:56] song and we kind of change the subject
[1:58:00] when really that was the very moment
[1:58:02] the still Small Voice was trying to
[1:58:05] reach down through all the noise of your
[1:58:08] life
[1:58:12] I wonder friends
[1:58:15] if we have substituted the still small
[1:58:17] voice of God
[1:58:20] with loud music
[1:58:24] or I don't really want to talk about it
[1:58:26] or they're part of our group so it's
[1:58:29] okay you know they're in our church so
[1:58:32] it's okay but if it's another church
[1:58:34] down the road it's like oh that's
[1:58:36] horrible that's so bad let's tell
[1:58:38] everybody
[1:58:39] shame on us that's not the spirit of
[1:58:42] Christ the spirit of Christ would be oh
[1:58:45] good
[1:58:46] where are those that sigh and cry
[1:58:50] boy this is a real young people's
[1:58:52] message today isn't it where are those
[1:58:54] that sigh and cry
[1:59:04] he's screaming this is a growing man
[1:59:08] and a minister he's screaming
[1:59:12] to the top of his voice
[1:59:18] so I told Billy and Billy that day he
[1:59:22] went fishing been hanging down on the
[1:59:24] river a lot and there was a man from
[1:59:26] India there to meet me see ministers and
[1:59:28] things
[1:59:33] went down into New Albany with my wife
[1:59:35] that's where Brother John
[1:59:37] Andy's was born as a New Albany
[1:59:40] he just went right down into this place
[1:59:43] and he was going to be with these
[1:59:45] ministers and she had to go down there
[1:59:47] and something to know we went down and I
[1:59:49] was sitting talking to the ministers and
[1:59:51] all at once something said to me get out
[1:59:53] of here right quick and I thought that
[1:59:55] was just my imagination I said well now
[1:59:58] Brethren were fixing to go to India
[2:00:00] we're fixing to you know have these
[2:00:01] meetings and so forth and something said
[2:00:03] get out of here
[2:00:05] and get to yourself
[2:00:08] oh that would be a good message for all
[2:00:10] of us today
[2:00:15] it's in the
[2:00:17] it's in the quietness when we're all
[2:00:20] alone
[2:00:21] that we can hear the still small voice
[2:00:23] of God
[2:00:25] and turn your cell phone off
[2:00:28] just turn your device off
[2:00:31] for a few minutes
[2:00:33] God wants to talk to you
[2:00:35] how many think it would be fantastic of
[2:00:37] all of us when we left these meetings we
[2:00:40] just fell in love with Jesus and if God
[2:00:43] would give us another year that we just
[2:00:45] come back just it was just such a
[2:00:47] wonderful year of in the presence of God
[2:00:55] how many would appreciate that
[2:00:59] oh yes get to yourself get to yourself
[2:01:02] so I got out of the car and and I said
[2:01:05] excuse me brother and just a minute I
[2:01:07] want to go around the corner and I went
[2:01:09] around and I looked and nobody was
[2:01:10] looking I said father what is it I said
[2:01:12] go to Billy Paul at once
[2:01:14] and I run back real quick and media was
[2:01:17] coming up the street my wife and I said
[2:01:19] hurry honey hurry
[2:01:20] something's wrong with Billy and we run
[2:01:22] and jumped in a car and it took out to
[2:01:25] Jeffersonville about five or six miles
[2:01:27] and I went into the yard my
[2:01:29] mother-in-law's standing in the yard
[2:01:31] screaming the top of a voice saying
[2:01:33] Billy's dying got him in the hospital I
[2:01:36] said what happened
[2:01:38] said well he came up there and he had a
[2:01:40] sore throat and he was afraid you were
[2:01:42] going to catch him with that sore throat
[2:01:44] and tell him he was still smoking
[2:01:46] cigarettes
[2:01:47] and he went down and got your good
[2:01:49] friend the best doctor there is in the
[2:01:51] nation one of the best Dr Sam Adair and
[2:01:54] gave him a shot of penicillin
[2:01:58] and he swelled up about that big in just
[2:02:00] about three minutes and he ran up there
[2:02:02] and they wrapped him in blankets and
[2:02:04] rushed him into the hospital and I run
[2:02:06] out real quick and here come the doctor
[2:02:08] down like that and took off his hat and
[2:02:10] said Bill I've killed your boy
[2:02:12] I said oh doc surely not and I run into
[2:02:15] the room and they had oxygen over him
[2:02:19] and everything and pumping
[2:02:22] and giving him adrenaline over his heart
[2:02:26] I thank God
[2:02:28] had another future planned for brother
[2:02:31] Billy
[2:02:32] I believe this very morn very day
[2:02:36] October here God allowed this testimony
[2:02:39] for some young person
[2:02:41] saying you don't have to go to this
[2:02:43] place
[2:02:45] [Applause]
[2:02:53] I'm giving you a warning I'm giving you
[2:02:56] a solemn warning
[2:02:58] we can be in great meetings we can be in
[2:03:01] prayer lines we can have the Holy Spirit
[2:03:03] moving all around us and have blind eyes
[2:03:05] come open right around be in cabins and
[2:03:08] have counselors spend thousands of
[2:03:10] dollars and have home movements and 90
[2:03:12] to 100 000 spin we say that's incredible
[2:03:15] well God will do everything for just one
[2:03:18] of you to get the message
[2:03:29] God bless you some are having to leave
[2:03:31] but can I just have a few more minutes
[2:03:34] I think my sister Heidi Davis is here
[2:03:36] are you here sister Heidi
[2:03:39] is your daughter here where is Sister
[2:03:41] Davis she's right here
[2:03:44] this young lady sang this morning and
[2:03:46] she's tall and beautiful
[2:03:51] brother John was with her when she would
[2:03:53] just fit into my hand
[2:03:58] born premature in a hospital in Seattle
[2:04:02] and we came after a Saturday night
[2:04:04] service and we come on a Saturday Friday
[2:04:06] night service and come on Saturday and
[2:04:08] sister
[2:04:10] Davis is now she would fit right into my
[2:04:12] hand
[2:04:15] and all the wires and all the tubes and
[2:04:17] everything
[2:04:18] aren't you so happy God had a plan that
[2:04:21] looked Way Beyond that little baby in
[2:04:24] her hand
[2:04:35] God bless you today
[2:04:37] but here's Billy Paul now and he's in a
[2:04:39] place an adrenaline is over his heart
[2:04:41] and a heart going on down and down and I
[2:04:45] just could I be with him a moment so he
[2:04:48] just walked out of the room
[2:04:52] that was the doctor walked out of the
[2:04:53] room and I knelt down I put my hands on
[2:04:56] him there's something about contact
[2:04:59] if I would have had another message to
[2:05:01] preacher I probably would have spoke on
[2:05:03] the power of touch it is so incredible
[2:05:06] when Jesus touched
[2:05:10] when the woman touched the border of His
[2:05:13] Garment the power of touch
[2:05:16] friends we need to be together we need
[2:05:18] to
[2:05:19] encourage one another we need to get
[2:05:22] into the game
[2:05:26] I'm speaking spiritually he said dear
[2:05:28] God please hasn't my heart been broken
[2:05:30] enough in my days please Jesus oh God
[2:05:34] give the boy another chance
[2:05:36] Lord please I ask you with all my heart
[2:05:38] as your servant if you'll spare the life
[2:05:40] of my boy he's so good to me and helps
[2:05:42] me in the meeting he's so loyal to me I
[2:05:44] need him God please don't take him I ask
[2:05:47] you not
[2:05:52] and I looked and I saw a vision of him
[2:05:54] falling like that and turning over and
[2:05:57] over like it was a couple nights before
[2:06:00] that when I seen him in the vision
[2:06:02] and I've seen that we're coming to the
[2:06:05] climax I've seen two big arms come out
[2:06:08] and catch him
[2:06:13] two big arms come out and catch him like
[2:06:16] this
[2:06:17] [Applause]
[2:06:25] and started burying him right back up
[2:06:28] going right back up like that and I
[2:06:31] raised up and Billy turned around just
[2:06:33] as black as he could be and his lips
[2:06:36] swelled way out and his eyes turned red
[2:06:38] and turned back
[2:06:41] we ought to thank God for a
[2:06:43] predestinated seed today
[2:06:46] because Marilyn Monroe
[2:06:49] Marilyn Monroe came to this exact moment
[2:06:54] raised in foster homes in orphanages
[2:06:56] didn't know her daddy her mother's
[2:06:59] beating her head on an insane wall
[2:07:02] she's trying to be popular
[2:07:04] she became a sex symbol to the world
[2:07:09] and she's on all kinds of drugs and
[2:07:11] medications laying in a bed and and
[2:07:14] she's just going through the motions and
[2:07:16] she's married three times now she's
[2:07:18] divorced again this is the third time
[2:07:20] she's all alone
[2:07:25] and she's weary it's like is there more
[2:07:28] to life than this
[2:07:30] and her heart started being
[2:07:35] and she's reached for the phone
[2:07:39] and she's gone
[2:07:44] the world thinks she died of suicide a
[2:07:47] prophet saw her by vision
[2:07:49] reaching for the folk she's gone
[2:07:55] God
[2:07:56] she could walk through here today
[2:08:00] passed our brothers back there the
[2:08:03] security team
[2:08:06] and she comes walking down the aisle
[2:08:10] and we gave her a microphone for five
[2:08:12] minutes
[2:08:15] I think she would be like you don't want
[2:08:18] to go there you don't want to be there
[2:08:22] she had money she had all kinds of
[2:08:24] things that
[2:08:25] don't go there
[2:08:27] and here's a young man in the message
[2:08:29] that could have went the same way
[2:08:32] and they could have had a service and he
[2:08:34] could have had a tombstone in
[2:08:35] Jeffersonville
[2:08:37] Billy Paul Branham
[2:08:42] well I wish I had more time I really do
[2:08:47] I was raised in that same Tabernacle
[2:08:50] my best friend was the Deacon son
[2:08:55] my best friend was the pastors
[2:08:58] it would be nephew
[2:09:00] and and growing up this was the person
[2:09:03] we would go to his home we would go to
[2:09:05] his house I have all kinds of memories
[2:09:07] and but when he came into High School it
[2:09:09] became popular he became
[2:09:11] on the student council and it became out
[2:09:14] there
[2:09:18] in the Branham Tabernacle
[2:09:23] and he got his truck and he got all of
[2:09:25] this and
[2:09:28] but one day he just went to a place
[2:09:32] and took his own life
[2:09:34] I'll never forget it
[2:09:36] being in the Branham Tabernacle my they
[2:09:39] took buses and buses of all the friends
[2:09:41] all the people from the high school and
[2:09:43] they just packed out the place never
[2:09:45] forget it
[2:09:48] and going up to the same Cemetery where
[2:09:50] brother William Branham is buried and
[2:09:54] having his mother fall over the casket
[2:09:56] and say but you never said goodbye
[2:10:03] I'm so thankful that God had another
[2:10:05] story
[2:10:07] and God has another story for your life
[2:10:10] [Applause]
[2:10:13] it doesn't have to end like that
[2:10:17] and let my voice ring through this
[2:10:19] building through the internet and I hope
[2:10:22] in eternity every person's on the right
[2:10:25] side I hope unto Josh these Services
[2:10:28] aren't having to be played again
[2:10:31] in the regions of the lost and any
[2:10:34] person here
[2:10:35] didn't make it
[2:10:41] that's why we say things to the risk of
[2:10:44] being misunderstood
[2:10:46] and not to be popular

[2:11:30] the Baton
[2:11:33] I was going to show you what it looks
[2:11:35] like on the screen

[2:11:40] that is passed
[2:11:41] between one each member of a relay team
[2:11:45] I was going to show you and speak about
[2:11:47] this
[2:11:50] I was going to move along
[2:11:52] I'm receiving the Baton
[2:11:55] I was going to speak to you about
[2:11:57] passing the Baton and receiving the
[2:11:59] Baton
[2:12:00] I was going to speak about what it means
[2:12:02] and on this relay team and then now
[2:12:05] spiritually what it means that each
[2:12:07] succeeding generation
[2:12:09] receives the Holy Spirit and until that
[2:12:12] Rapture I was going to speak about every
[2:12:15] generation every succeeding generation

[2:12:19] Spirit in the next slide it's for every
[2:12:21] generation I was going to show you
[2:12:24] this is the Olympic team and this is how
[2:12:26] they we talk about the responsibilities
[2:12:29] of the runners
[2:12:32] and how there's a way to pass it off
[2:12:34] there's a transition
[2:12:36] that happens
[2:12:38] and it's usually during the time of
[2:12:40] transition and Junctions that are the
[2:12:43] most critical and crucial is usually
[2:12:46] when it's dropped
[2:12:48] that's usually when people stumble
[2:12:50] that's usually at the turning and the
[2:12:52] age the Turning of a corner I'm in the
[2:12:54] next slide next slide brother Matt I'm
[2:12:56] even moving through
[2:12:59] I was going to speak about these things
[2:13:01] brother country Diggs this is one of his
[2:13:03] favorite quotes about drinking in and
[2:13:04] pushing out drinking in pushing out you
[2:13:07] remember that brother Cadre I remember
[2:13:08] you preaching on that where Pentecost
[2:13:11] failed
[2:13:13] and I wonder if there would be a warning
[2:13:15] where in the message people are failing
[2:13:21] I don't have to be another Camp I guess
[2:13:25] I was going to speak to you about
[2:13:26] receiving the Holy Ghost and these I was
[2:13:29] going to speak about Jonah
[2:13:31] and where are you going Jonah
[2:13:34] this could be for somebody
[2:13:37] give me 20 seconds or 30 on Jonah
[2:13:40] God called him to Nineveh and he went to
[2:13:43] Joppa and took a ship to tarshis
[2:13:46] can you all see on the screen how far it
[2:13:49] was
[2:13:50] yeah where are you going
[2:13:54] after this Camp I mean I got the holy I
[2:13:57] had to meet but you could be making
[2:13:59] the most horrible mistake you ever have
[2:14:02] in your whole life
[2:14:03] and God is trying to say where are you
[2:14:05] going
[2:14:12] look at this way out there to torch it
[2:14:15] somewhere where is he going
[2:14:17] and and God prepared a great fish and
[2:14:19] brought him back
[2:14:20] I was going to show you on the screen
[2:14:22] some of the things that is coming upon
[2:14:25] the Earth and how the world is preparing
[2:14:27] for a tribulation
[2:14:31] I was going to show you these images and
[2:14:34] then show you Armageddon in Book of
[2:14:36] Revelation that there's been promise to
[2:14:38] be these things happen and brother
[2:14:40] Branham talking about nuclear things and
[2:14:43] I was just reading in the last few weeks
[2:14:45] how they said just the
[2:14:48] um
[2:14:48] when a nuclear bomb goes off and it
[2:14:51] flares out and then the tsunami will
[2:14:54] kill Millions
[2:14:59] I was going to show you images like this
[2:15:01] and how the world is preparing for its
[2:15:04] destruction
[2:15:08] I mean where did they get even the
[2:15:11] producers to think of this
[2:15:13] next slide is in Seattle
[2:15:16] why did they even think of water going
[2:15:19] into cities like this
[2:15:21] it's because they're anointed for
[2:15:23] distraction
[2:15:25] I think it's October 30th is that the
[2:15:27] right date today
[2:15:29] tomorrow they call Halloween we're going
[2:15:31] to drive out of here after a whole
[2:15:33] weekend of Glorious meetings right back
[2:15:35] into hell
[2:15:37] before you get to the town you're going
[2:15:38] to see schools and bones and devils and
[2:15:41] people trying to act like something
[2:15:43] they're not
[2:15:44] it's all a cover
[2:15:46] and what used to be little children in
[2:15:49] candy has become adults it's a
[2:15:51] multi-billion dollar industry with blood
[2:15:54] and all the things of hell hell has come
[2:15:57] up in this generation
[2:15:59] we're going out there to face hell
[2:16:01] [Applause]
[2:16:11] this is Los Angeles this is what they
[2:16:14] actually know is gonna happen this is
[2:16:16] the world
[2:16:19] so we talk about heaven we talk about
[2:16:21] hell and where are we going
[2:16:24] thank God for the token
[2:16:27] thank God for meetings like this
[2:16:29] thank God that we can apply the token
[2:16:31] Hallelujah
[2:16:34] thank God for ministers that will give
[2:16:36] us the the pertinent parts and just say
[2:16:38] it the way it is
[2:16:40] would somebody talk about music Somebody
[2:16:42] talk about relationships
[2:16:44] brother Branham did
[2:16:46] nobody wants to talk about it it seems
[2:16:48] today but brother Branham said it when
[2:16:50] he was a pastor he would take a Sunday
[2:16:52] with the young men and speak about sex
[2:16:54] and things
[2:16:56] and he said I take the next and speak to
[2:16:58] the young ladies to curb these things
[2:17:01] out that's what your Prophet said
[2:17:04] we don't want to talk about it we don't
[2:17:06] want to use the word from behind the
[2:17:07] pulpit but I'll tell you what friends if
[2:17:10] this new generation is going to make it
[2:17:12] there's got to be some men that have
[2:17:14] enough courage to just say it
[2:17:17] [Applause]
[2:17:28] I was going to speak about this and I
[2:17:31] had this for years on my office wall for
[2:17:34] years
[2:17:35] it was a constant daily reminder
[2:17:40] of our young men and young ladies at the
[2:17:42] crossroads of their life
[2:17:45] and how that our boys has got ten times
[2:17:47] the Temptation that we had
[2:17:50] and sisters do you realize that your
[2:17:51] daughters
[2:17:52] has ten times the Temptation you had
[2:17:54] when you as a girl
[2:17:58] it's true
[2:17:59] I know it's not easy being a counselor
[2:18:02] at a camp where people come from all
[2:18:04] different churches and different
[2:18:06] standards of dress and living and things
[2:18:10] God bless all of you counselors I wish I
[2:18:12] could have been out here to see your
[2:18:13] faces God bless you counselors
[2:18:16] you've been a real heroes
[2:18:19] he talks about pastors
[2:18:22] and brothers and blushing prophet he
[2:18:24] talked about my I wonder how many
[2:18:26] ministers would set talk like this
[2:18:29] about their prayer life and them being
[2:18:32] guilty we're guilty we're all guilty
[2:18:34] I wonder how many pastors would say that
[2:18:36] today how many ministers will be that
[2:18:39] real
[2:18:45] we've got to move along here and talk
[2:18:47] about the Holy Ghost I was going to put
[2:18:49] it in front of you but these are some of
[2:18:51] the images in the Rapture brother
[2:18:53] Brennan was talking about thus saith the
[2:18:56] Lord
[2:18:57] and California
[2:18:59] in leadership he talked about an
[2:19:01] earthquake that would come and speak
[2:19:03] about Hollywood and Los Angeles sliding
[2:19:05] into the ocean
[2:19:10] California you're doomed not only
[2:19:12] California but you the world you're
[2:19:14] doomed
[2:19:15] and here's a a quote out of the church
[2:19:17] age book The Last in seventh Aid Vision
[2:19:20] was wherein I heard the most terrible
[2:19:23] explosion and I as I turned to look I
[2:19:26] saw nothing but debris craters and smoke
[2:19:29] all over the land of America
[2:19:33] next slide you can see this
[2:19:37] all over the land of America
[2:19:42] next slide look at this friends this
[2:19:44] this is the future
[2:19:47] this is your America and it doesn't
[2:19:49] matter if Trump Biden or a woman

[2:19:54] it doesn't matter if you're Democratic
[2:19:57] Republican independent or don't vote
[2:20:00] the world is falling apart
[2:20:01] [Applause]
[2:20:10] and we're closing with one question
[2:20:13] where are you going
[2:20:16] we see where America is going we see
[2:20:18] where all Los Angeles is going in
[2:20:20] brother Bradham even then the next slide
[2:20:21] talks about this in choosing of the
[2:20:23] Bride about the city of the Angels
[2:20:28] next slide it'll be worse than the last
[2:20:31] day of Pompeii remember one day you'll
[2:20:34] be laying in the bottom of the sea
[2:20:37] and this and the next slide was the city
[2:20:39] of Pompeii when it was destroyed

[2:21:21] in the city of Pompeii
