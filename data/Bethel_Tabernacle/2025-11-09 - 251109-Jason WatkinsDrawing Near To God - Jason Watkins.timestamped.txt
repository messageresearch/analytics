[7:12] Amen.
[7:14] Brother Luther, I wonder if you could
[7:15] come and
[7:18] take up the offering this morning. How
[7:19] many's got a need this morning?
[7:22] Amen. Lift it before the Lord. He's very
[7:26] mindful of his people this morning.
[7:28] Amen. Welcome to all the guests. Come
[7:30] on, brother. All our visitors today,
[7:32] just enter into the worship with us and
[7:36] the word of God.
[7:42] Amen. Um, I got a couple of uh church
[7:45] order announcements. We just [music]
[7:47] want to repeat a little bit what we said
[7:48] on Wednesday.
[7:50] Um,
[7:52] you know, it and and it was funny that
[7:53] Joe Hartell got up here and said, "If
[7:55] [music] you wanted to take notes on your
[7:57] cell phone," and I was back there like,
[7:58] "No, no, no, no, no." But, you know, if
[8:01] you use your cell phone for worshiping
[8:02] the Lord or taking a notes in the
[8:04] service, that's fine. It's up to you.
[8:07] It's in your heart. It's not like people
[8:08] can sit there and look over your
[8:09] shoulder. You're texting a friend or
[8:11] something. God knows. Um, so if you're
[8:15] using it for the kingdom, Amen.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[8:17] &gt;&gt; If you're reading your Bible on it, all
[8:18] that, that's good. But once we get in
[8:21] here, we do want to just focus on the
[8:23] Lord. This this is a sanctuary.
[8:26] Um,
[8:28] so one of the things I'm going to say it
[8:31] this way that I've been requested to
[8:33] talk about was we have a nursery for the
[8:35] moms and the babies. And um, you know,
[8:40] Brother Brandham said talked about moms
[8:42] that had to go in and out, take care of
[8:44] the babies and stuff like that. [music]
[8:46] He said, "God sees that and God will
[8:48] honor that." And and um I had babies
[8:52] long time ago
[8:54] and they it it's a job that's mom's job
[8:58] is like the the best job on the planet.
[9:01] Also one of the hardest. Um and we do
[9:04] appreciate you. And [music] so and you
[9:06] realize when your little one's fussing
[9:09] or something and you need to go to the
[9:10] nursery, you know, we're not going to be
[9:12] sitting there going, "Oh, you need to
[9:13] go." So, we just want to bring that up.
[9:17] Um, now I mentioned something about they
[9:21] didn't ask me to mention this part about
[9:23] gum.
[9:25] Okay? And anybody that reads the message
[9:28] knows what brother Brandham said about
[9:29] chewing gum in the sanctuary. Okay? He
[9:32] said it grieves the angel of the Lord.
[9:35] [music and clears throat] So therefore,
[9:36] that's why I mention it, not because um
[9:40] it's my thought. I try not to take my
[9:43] thoughts.
[9:45] So, um, we would appreciate it. We, um,
[9:48] don't allow chewing gum in the
[9:50] sanctuary. You know, if you, if [music]
[9:52] you inadvertently come in, it's not like
[9:54] a, you know, a felony or anything. You
[9:56] just, you realize, okay, just go get rid
[9:59] of it one way or another.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; Um, I'm not here picking on anybody. Um,
[10:05] I'm just doing [music] a job back there.
[10:07] And um I guess you could say I'm
[10:10] guarding [music] the door.
[10:12] So we would appreciate it if if you're
[10:14] chewing gum,
[10:16] just get rid of it.
[10:18] And the other thing is this is [music]
[10:20] when like just before services is
[10:22] starting and stuff, those doors back
[10:23] there don't block out hardly any noise.
[10:26] And I know sometimes you meet a [music]
[10:28] sister you haven't seen or a brother and
[10:30] you're right at the door and you're
[10:31] you're talking and it's a little loud.
[10:33] comes right in the sanctuary. And you
[10:35] got people in here that are, you know,
[10:37] maybe reading their Bible, praying in
[10:40] preparation for the service. So, I'm
[10:43] just I just ask this is me asking cuz I
[10:45] sit back there, you know, if you would
[10:47] move away from the back doors, do it off
[10:49] to the side or [music] something so that
[10:51] until we get it rebuilt and there's a
[10:53] vestibule and stuff back there, we need
[10:56] to kind of take care of that. You love
[10:59] me?
[11:00] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[11:01] &gt;&gt; Let me hear you say amen.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, that's none of
[11:05] that is me. Right.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray.
[11:12] Father, I love you this morning. And
[11:14] Lord, the Sunday school that we heard,
[11:16] Father, and so many people can make it
[11:19] dos and don'ts,
[11:22] but Lord, if we just get the doer in our
[11:25] hearts and Lord, walk before you by
[11:28] faith, Father, it's it's pleasing for us
[11:32] to be able to please you in walking
[11:34] according to your word. I pray that
[11:37] you'll bless our visitors, bless the
[11:38] service this morning.
[11:41] Father, we come for [music] one purpose.
[11:44] to gather together in the name of Jesus
[11:46] Christ. You said you'd be there in our
[11:48] midst. May we with open hearts looking
[11:50] to you this [music] morning,
[11:53] receive what you have for us. And we
[11:55] pray that you'd receive our worship that
[11:57] it would be in spirit and truth. It
[12:00] would be pleasing to you. We love you,
[12:02] Lord. We worship you. Pray for those
[12:04] that are streaming. I want to mention
[12:06] [music] the sick amongst us, Lord. Those
[12:08] that might be streaming, fighting things
[12:10] like cancer, [music] just
[12:16] Father, I pray for them in the name
[12:18] [music] of Jesus Christ. You'd comfort
[12:19] them today. We know that you're a
[12:22] healer. [music] Grant us the faith and
[12:24] revelation to receive it. Father, as we
[12:27] collect the tithes and offerings,
[12:28] Father, I pray that you bless the
[12:29] cheerful giver. We thank you for the
[12:32] bounty that you give us, Lord. Nobody
[12:35] here is begging bread. We thank you for
[12:38] that. Bless your people, we pray in
[12:40] Jesus name. Amen.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you greet one another in
[12:45] the name of the Lord as we sing this
[12:48] song? We haven't sung this one in a
[12:50] little bit. Someone needs some help.
[12:55] These are the days of Elijah
[13:00] [music] declaring the word of [singing]
[13:03] the Lord. Put your hands together. And
[13:06] these are the days [music]
[13:08] of your servant Moses righteousness
[13:13] being [music]
[13:14] restored.
[13:17] And though [singing] these are days of
[13:20] great trials
[13:22] of famine and [music] darkness [singing]
[13:25] and sore.

[13:31] desert crying prepare ye the way of the
[13:36] Lord. [music]
[13:37] Behold he comes
[13:40] riding [music] on the clouds

[14:20] praise.

[14:26] harvest. Oh hallelujah. [music]

[28:03] blessed be your name.
[28:07] [music]
[28:08] Every blessing you pour [singing] out of
[28:13] turn back to praise.
[28:17] When the [music] darkness closes
[28:19] [singing]
[28:20] in, Lord, still I [music] will say,

[30:50] Cuz you give [music and singing] and
[30:52] take away.
[30:55] You give and take [music] away.
[30:59] My heart will choose to say,
[31:03] "Oh, blessed [music and singing]
[31:04] be your name.
[31:10] [applause]
[31:11] Praise the Lord."
[31:16] Amen. I texted Sister Esther this
[31:18] morning and asked her to sing for us
[31:20] again. Um, the last time she sung this
[31:23] song, I think everybody was upside down.
[31:26] So come sing this for us with your
[31:28] sisters are singing with you. Amen. Come
[31:31] on. It's nice to have your family here
[31:34] with us. Good to see you brother,
[31:35] sister. God bless you. So many visitors
[31:38] here today. I'd like to make sure I

[31:48] in glory in the other dimension, we'll
[31:50] uh we'll all know each other's names. So
[31:53] God bless you. God bless you each one.

[32:15] to my knees and pray.
[32:21] Come [music] Jesus come.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; [music]
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Let be the [singing] day.

[37:02] &gt;&gt; [music]
[37:03] [applause]
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Certainly enjoyed that this morning. God
[37:15] bless you. We greet you in the name of
[37:17] the Lord. Happy to have you here in the
[37:18] house of God with us today. Amen. And we
[37:22] want [clears throat] to get to the word.
[37:23] I sure enjoy was enjoying all of that
[37:25] singing and uh step out and see a lot of
[37:29] visitors here. God bless you. We're
[37:30] happy to have you all here today with
[37:32] us. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you
[37:34] all. We're going to invite you to
[37:35] Matthew chapter 13 this morning. Amen.
[37:39] [clears throat]
[37:47] I've had a thought um
[37:50] going
[37:53] simmering as they would say on the back
[37:54] burner for some weeks and been trying to
[37:58] wait for the uncction of the Holy Spirit
[38:00] to come to it. And I think today, Amen.
[38:02] I thought how appropriate, Sister
[38:04] Esther, and then would sing that. You
[38:06] know, today could be the day. Amen.
[38:07] Praise the Lord. What if today was
[38:09] rapture day?
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[38:13] My goodness. Amen. Make us all want to
[38:15] roll around on the ground, don't it?
[38:17] [laughter]
[38:18] Amen. So, I want to speak to you today
[38:21] from a burden of the word the Lord put
[38:23] on my heart called drawing near to God.
[38:26] I think that nothing
[38:29] um is of more paramount importance than
[38:32] that you would not just draw near to
[38:35] God, but live near God. And I think by
[38:39] the help of the Lord, we'll be able to
[38:41] demonstrate that today in the word.
[38:43] Amen. Drawing near to God. But really
[38:47] the the emphasis and I want to remember
[38:50] I want to tell you what I'm going to
[38:51] tell you. Then I'm going to tell you,
[38:53] then I'm going to tell you what I told
[38:54] you. Amen. So the emphasis today is to
[38:59] draw near to God and to live there. Turn
[39:02] around, shake hands with somebody
[39:03] standing near you. Amen. Say, "God bless
[39:06] you. We're happy to have you in the
[39:07] house of God today. Amen.
[39:10] [clears throat]
[39:11] Praise the Lord.
[39:14] Nothing like the family of God. Amen.
[39:19] Praise the Lord, buddy. What you doing
[39:21] slipping here on me like this? Amen.
[39:22] Praise God. Brother Bob, different ones,
[39:25] other different ones. God bless you
[39:26] there. Happy to have you all here. Amen.
[39:29] Uh pray. Oh, this must be uh uh um Aby's
[39:32] family. Is this your family, Abigail?
[39:34] All right. Praise the Lord. God bless
[39:35] you. Happy to have you. Amen. Happy to
[39:37] have all these visitors here today.
[39:39] Amen.
[39:41] Amen. We're not about to call brother
[39:43] Randy and Sister Anna visitors. They're
[39:44] family. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, we're
[39:47] happy to have all of you here, different
[39:48] ones today. God bless you, brother.
[39:51] Amen. Amen. Brother Jack, I appreciated
[39:53] that quote you sent me. That was just
[39:55] spot on. Amen. Matthew chapter 13. We're
[40:00] going to catch, we're going to go
[40:01] through 17 verses, but we're only going
[40:03] to read the first nine, and we will let
[40:06] you be seated. [clears throat]
[40:10] The same day went Jesus out of the
[40:12] house, and sat by the seaside,
[40:16] and great multitudes were gathered
[40:18] together unto him, so that he went into
[40:21] a ship, and sat, and the whole multitude
[40:24] stood on the shore.
[40:26] And he spake many things unto them in
[40:29] parables, saying, Behold, a swer went
[40:33] forth to sew. And when he sowed, some
[40:37] seeds fell by the wayside, and the fowls
[40:40] came and devoured them up. Verse five.
[40:43] Some fell upon stony places where they
[40:47] had not much earth and forth with they
[40:50] sprung up
[40:52] because they had no deepness of earth.
[40:56] Um and when the sun was come up, they
[41:00] were scorched and because they had no
[41:02] root, they withered away.
[41:05] Some fell among thorns and the thorns
[41:08] sprung up and choked them. Verse eight,
[41:11] but other fell into good ground and
[41:15] brought forth fruit, some, now catch
[41:18] this nuance. Some brought forth a
[41:20] hundfold,
[41:21] some 60fold, some 30fold.
[41:26] Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
[41:29] Let's pray. [clears throat]
[41:31] Father, we thank you for your word this
[41:33] morning. And I just settle my heart and
[41:36] mind now, master, to look into these
[41:38] great and precious promises. It's by
[41:40] these very things that we are partakers
[41:43] of the divine nature. And Lord, there
[41:45] could be no greater desire than to
[41:48] partake of the divine nature. And I have
[41:52] a burden on my heart, a particular Lord.
[41:55] And I'm certainly be preaching to myself
[41:57] today. And I I'm I just know that it'll
[42:01] help others as it has helped me, Lord.
[42:04] And so I commit it to you. I commit
[42:06] myself into your hands as your servant,
[42:10] just as your assistant here at the pull
[42:11] pit. You're you're the preacher this
[42:13] morning, Lord. They sang a song. We step
[42:16] forward. We're only here to assist you.
[42:19] I pray you'll give us all hearing hearts
[42:21] and the visible audience and the
[42:22] invisible audience out across the
[42:24] airways. May it be all to your glory. In
[42:28] Jesus' name we pray. Amen. God bless
[42:31] you, friend. You can be seated.
[42:34] Praise the Lord. Amen. Anelisa's parents
[42:37] here with us as well. Amen. Happy to
[42:40] have different ones. I'm trying so hard,
[42:42] sister. Good to see you again. God bless
[42:43] you here with us on a Sunday morning.
[42:46] Amen. Happy to have you all here in the
[42:48] house of God.
[42:56] I don't know [clears throat] where to
[42:58] begin other than just to begin at the
[43:00] beginning. And I've tried. And that
[43:02] might seem simple, but you'd
[43:05] [clears throat] be amazed at how much
[43:08] time I've spent just trying to figure
[43:10] out where to start. Amen. Because I I'm
[43:13] um I I'm a person of order. And um and I
[43:18] and and and I I like to be ordered as I
[43:20] go along.
[43:22] So, you know, when we look at the
[43:24] parable of the sewer, my goodness, it's
[43:27] been preached on, you know, through the
[43:30] through the centuries to the church and
[43:32] there's been every every look at it and
[43:35] almost we've over, you know, turned over
[43:38] every stone and looked under every and
[43:40] looked in every aspect of it. And I've
[43:42] heard some real amazing
[43:45] sermons taken from Matthew 13. First of
[43:48] all, Matthew 13 is the church ages in
[43:52] symbol form that is later augmented in
[43:56] the book of revelation. So whenever you
[43:58] read those first three chapters of the
[44:01] book of revelation, you can find every
[44:02] bit of it in Matthew 13. They all
[44:05] overlay you, you know, and I I don't
[44:08] want to get into the um into the nooks
[44:11] and crannies of that today because I'm
[44:12] that's not really my burden. There's a a
[44:15] number of things we could say here. You
[44:17] know, one of the one of the things that
[44:19] I that I that I when I look at that
[44:22] that's sewn by the wayside is the kind
[44:26] of a person who just hears the word and
[44:29] they're indifferent to it. They're
[44:30] ambivalent. They're just there's it
[44:32] means nothing to them. And and that's a
[44:35] sad state to be in. And I I had a sister
[44:38] one time who said to me she came for
[44:40] prayer because her mother who was an
[44:42] unbeliever and was in a denomination and
[44:44] she was very much opposed to her
[44:46] daughter being involved in the message
[44:48] and told her it was a cult and she
[44:49] should stay away from it. But her mother
[44:51] was angry. The sister wasn't coming to
[44:53] you know to try to to say I know this. I
[44:56] understand she doesn't understand what I
[44:58] see but I can't deal with the anger.
[45:01] What do I do about the anger? My
[45:02] mother's getting so angry. And I said
[45:04] well sister praise the Lord. She said,
[45:06] "Praise the Lord. How is that possibly I
[45:09] could praise the Lord? My mother's
[45:11] angry." And I said, "Well, that's the
[45:12] second best response she could have."
[45:15] She said, "How is that anything a second
[45:18] best response?" And I said, "Well, what
[45:20] if it didn't mean anything to her?" And
[45:22] she would just pat you on the head and
[45:24] say, "That's nice, darling. God bless
[45:25] you. Carry on." And it meant nothing to
[45:28] her. And it would just it went in one
[45:30] ear and it went out the other. And that
[45:32] is actually the overwhelming
[45:34] uh
[45:36] fulfillment that we see in the world
[45:38] today. The people uh they don't uh you
[45:41] know they they they don't see any need
[45:44] they don't see any need for real ferveny
[45:46] or to really believe a gospel that
[45:49] actually changes their life. I've said
[45:50] for years that when you haunt too long
[45:54] between two opinions, brother Brandham
[45:55] said that'll give you spiritual amnesia.
[45:58] And what'll happen to you? what I've
[46:00] seen happen too many times and I've I'm
[46:02] I'm sad to say that my experience
[46:05] teaches me that I've seen it even in
[46:08] people who ended up later on getting a
[46:11] hold of themselves coming to their
[46:13] senses, the Holy Spirit getting a hold
[46:15] of them and they proved out to be sons
[46:17] and daughters of God and became firm
[46:19] believers. So I so I know it can happen
[46:22] to believers where if if you if you wait
[46:26] around too long and you don't really
[46:28] commit yourself to ferveny. What'll
[46:30] happen is Satan will finally bring you a
[46:34] version of the gospel. And there's
[46:35] almost 40,000 different versions
[46:38] &gt;&gt; at this point and hearing 40,000
[46:41] different versions of the single gospel.
[46:44] Remember friends in the early alpha
[46:46] church of the days of the apostles every
[46:48] church was a message church. There was
[46:50] no such thing as a church, a Christian
[46:52] church that didn't preach the message
[46:54] because they were preaching Paul the
[46:56] messenger, preaching his doctrine. And
[46:58] the whole church was founded on the
[47:00] apostle on the doctrine of the apostles
[47:01] and prophets. So it's only it's only
[47:04] after the church began to decline that
[47:07] after 2,000 years we end up with almost
[47:09] 40,000 variations,
[47:12] denominations, countless independent
[47:14] Christian movements and organizations.
[47:16] But there's only one true version. And
[47:19] if you and if you wait too long and and
[47:21] you don't, you know, you just KIND OF
[47:23] STAY AROUND THE FIRE, you you like you
[47:25] love God, you you enjoy the presence of
[47:28] God, you come to church, you are a
[47:30] believer, BUT YET THERE'S THERE'S REALLY
[47:32] UM THERE'S REALLY NOT THAT REAL COMMITT
[47:35] TO where the Lord can COME IN AND REALLY
[47:38] SEAL UP THE vessel and seal the BOX CAR
[47:40] CUZ HE WON'T SEAL IT AS LONG AS HE knows
[47:42] the heart's not fully committed. NOW,
[47:44] THE BOX CAR IS NOT YOU LIVING A PERFECT
[47:47] enough life to get the Holy Ghost.
[47:48] That's not what that means. The box car
[47:51] is a is a is an illustration of the
[47:54] human heart. And when the Holy Spirit
[47:56] sees that your repentance is not
[47:58] complete, not full, not thorough, not
[48:01] absolute, not total, he will not seal
[48:04] that in. You've got to repent. And that
[48:07] means complete absolute abandonment of
[48:10] me. Now that I've met him, I don't want
[48:13] to be me. I want to be him.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THAT COMES, YOU DON'T NEED TO
[48:18] WAIT 40 DAYS. YOU DON'T NEED TO WAIT 10
[48:21] DAYS. YOU DON'T NEED TO FAST AND PRAY.
[48:23] THE HOLY GHOST IS THE PROMISE to you
[48:25] when your HEART HAS FULLY REPENTED AND
[48:28] ACCEPTED GOD'S WORD FOR THE HOUR in
[48:31] which you live.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:34] But when believers, EVEN GOD'S GANED
[48:36] FAMILY, IF I COULD SAY IT that way,
[48:39] linger too long and not and don't make
[48:41] that commitment, finally the devil will
[48:44] lead them to a version of the gospel
[48:46] that they want to be true.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; A VERSION THAT DOESN'T REALLY REQUIRE
[48:52] FERVENY OR A WHOLE lot of change WHERE
[48:54] THEY CAN STRADDLE THE FENCE AND BE LIKE
[48:56] THE the charismatic evangelical
[48:59] Christian world that IT GOD JUST, YOU
[49:01] KNOW, IT'S ALL IN MY HEART. GOD DOESN'T
[49:03] CARE HOW I live and I don't need TO
[49:06] CLEAN UP MY LANGUAGE OR CHANGE THE WAY I
[49:08] DRESS OR STOP GOING WHERE I GO. I THOSE
[49:10] THINGS DON'T MATTER. OH, THEY MATTER.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; They matter. If you want the power of
[49:16] God living in your life, it m your
[49:18] ferveny matters.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; And here I am doing what I didn't want
[49:25] to do and getting into the trenches of
[49:26] this. But I I'm not it's not up to me. I
[49:29] just have to I just have to I'm just
[49:30] here to assist. Amen.
[49:33] SO, AND THEN OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
[49:35] YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THE MAJORITY of the
[49:37] world who are they they were they the
[49:40] gospel came, they heard it, they
[49:42] appreciated it, they might have even
[49:43] agreed with it and then went went out
[49:45] the door and like looking in a mirror,
[49:48] they forgot the kind of person the word
[49:49] showed them they were and they went
[49:51] right on. They go right on with their
[49:52] own life. You go to the stony ground.
[49:54] It's not a ground full of stones. It's
[49:56] that's not what it's saying. It's
[49:58] talking about like if you've seen it
[50:00] maybe hiking in mountain areas where you
[50:03] have a A BIG BOULDER JUTTING OUT and
[50:05] there's a little thin veneer of soil on
[50:08] it and a little bit of moss and some
[50:09] flowers growing. But but but it's only
[50:12] there because it stays in the shade. If
[50:15] that if the sun would move or IF THAT
[50:17] BOULDER OR SOMETHING WOULD SHIFT THAT
[50:18] BLOCKS THE SUNLIGHT and the sunlight
[50:21] would hit it, IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH
[50:22] root structure TO RES TO HANDLE the the
[50:26] the heat of the sun and so therefore IT
[50:29] WITHERS. IN OTHER WORDS, IT GETS
[50:31] OFFENDED. IT BECOME IT ANONS WITH JOY
[50:33] WHEN IT HEARS THE GOSPEL BECAUSE
[50:35] SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST WANT a reprieve.
[50:38] THEY JUST WANT A A BREAK from sin. as
[50:40] brother Matt UH WATKINS PREACHED SOME
[50:43] YEARS AGO THAT PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES VERY
[50:45] SORRY FOR THE WHAT SIN HAS CAUSED IN
[50:48] THEIR LIFE. THEY'RE VERY MUCH REPENTANT
[50:50] OVER THE DESTRUCTION, BUT THEY'RE BUT
[50:53] THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS BEING SORRY FOR
[50:54] THE sin that led to that.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:59] AND SO PEOPLE ARE KNOWN WITH JOY. BUT
[51:01] THEN AS SOON AS IT AS SOON AS YOU BEGIN
[51:03] TO realize that this is supposed to make
[51:06] changes in your life, then you become
[51:08] offended at the word because you feel
[51:10] like it's telling you what to do. And
[51:12] that and and THE WORD IS NEVER DOING
[51:14] THAT. IT'S TELLING YOU WHAT YOU WHAT YOU
[51:16] IT THE WORD IS TRYING TO GET YOU TO
[51:18] UNDERSTAND. I KNOW GOD IS SAYING I KNOW
[51:21] HOW TO MAKE YOU HAPPY AND FULFILLED AND
[51:23] THAT IS TO KEEP MY WORD. RIGHT?
[51:26] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOD FORCING HIS WORD UPON YOU.
[51:29] IT'S GOD OFFERING YOU ETERNAL LIFE AND
[51:31] THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT AND THE AND THE
[51:34] AND LOVE AND JOY AND PEACE AND HAPPINESS
[51:36] AND THE POWER OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE. I'M
[51:38] GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIEND.
[51:40] THERE'S NOTHING LIKE LIVING a real
[51:41] fervent Christian life. Amen.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; But then OF COURSE IT COMES TO THAT
[51:46] WHICH IS AMONG THORNS AND that's a whole
[51:50] massive sermon in itself because this is
[51:53] this is where I THIS IS JUST WHERE I
[51:56] HAVE IN MY STUDY OF WHAT BROTHER
[51:57] BRANDHAM has said about it and the
[51:59] various scriptures I I can see when I
[52:02] read that about the thorns THAT IT
[52:04] SPRANG UP. IT WAS IT WAS GOSPEL SEED. It
[52:07] was the Jesus CALLED THE GO THE GOSPEL
[52:10] SEED AND IT'S GOOD SEED. IT'S JUST GOT
[52:12] TO GET IN GOOD GROUND. IF IT IF it lives
[52:14] like Lot did in Sodom, HE HAD A
[52:17] RIGHTEOUS SOUL. YOU UNDERSTAND? AND IT
[52:20] VEXED HIS RIGHTEOUS SOUL. BUT BROTHER
[52:22] BRANDHAM SAID HE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE
[52:24] PLAIN NERVE
[52:26] TO STAND AGAINST IT. I JUST SAY, LORD, I
[52:29] DON'T NEED, YOU KNOW, I DON'T NEED A
[52:31] FIREWORKS. I JUST NEED THE PLAIN NERVE.
[52:33] GIVE ME THE PLAIN NERVE TO WALK IN THIS
[52:36] SODOM WORLD AND STAND AGAINST IT IN MY
[52:39] LIFE AND LET THE WORLD KNOW WHOSE SIDE
[52:41] I'M actually on.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; No compromise. Amen.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; We we just recently I I mentioned to you
[52:49] that we had something in the works and
[52:52] there was an organization uh of of of
[52:55] evangelical Christian men and and they
[52:58] go around and they build churches for
[52:59] people and they do it for free and they
[53:01] just you just have to buy the material
[53:03] AND THEY SHOW UP HERE LIKE AN ARMY. You
[53:05] you've seen them. THEY THEY'LL BUILD
[53:06] THEY'LL THEY ACTUALLY WERE SAYING WE CAN
[53:09] COMPLETELY DRY in your next phase AND
[53:14] THEY WOULD DO IT OVER A WEEKEND
[53:17] AND WE WOULD SAVE TENS AND TENS AND TENS
[53:20] OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS cuz they would
[53:23] do all the labor for free. And it WENT
[53:25] THROUGH THEIR PROCESS AND WE WERE PRE
[53:28] PRELIMINARILY FAVORED AND THEN IT WENT
[53:31] TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND WE WERE MORE
[53:32] FAVORED AND IT WENT RIGHT TO THE
[53:34] DECISION LINE AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT WE
[53:37] LEAN TO THE teachings of William Brham
[53:40] and they pulled the plug.
[53:43] Pull the plug AND WE WERE ALMOST READY
[53:46] TO ANNOUNCE TO YOU GREAT TIDINGS OF JOY.
[53:49] WE'VE GOT A CREW COMING TO BUILD IT OVER
[53:51] A WEEKEND. AND THEY SAID, "LOOK," THEY
[53:53] WROTE US A QUESTION SAID, "WHAT ARE YOUR
[53:54] THOUGHTS ON WILLIAM BRANDAM?" THEY
[53:56] WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO
[53:57] ANSWER. They went on AND HEARD THE
[53:59] PREACHING THAT GOES ON IN THIS PULL PIT.
[54:02] AND THEY THEY PULLED THE PLUG AND THE
[54:04] THE MAN WHO WAS AT THE HEAD OF IT WAS A
[54:06] PASTOR AND HE SAYS, "NO, WE'RE NOT GOING
[54:08] TO DO ANYTHING FOR THOSE BRANDOMMITES."
[54:10] [snorts]
[54:12] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY? IT'S THEIR LOSS.
[54:15] They'll see on THE DAY OF ON THE DAY OF
[54:16] JUDGMENT, THEY MISSED A GOLDEN
[54:18] OPPORTUNITY for the blessing of God.
[54:20] See, I'M NOT GOING TO SWEAT IT. THE LORD
[54:22] THE LORD THE LORD KNEW IT WOULD HAPPEN.
[54:24] THE LORD HAS GOT US. THE LORD'S GOT
[54:26] THIS. SEE, SO SO YOU KNOW I I WANT THE
[54:31] PLAIN NERVE TO STAND AGAINST the the the
[54:35] the the the Christian light, message
[54:39] light, WHERE YOU KNOW I GET TO BE A
[54:42] BELIEVER OF WILLIAM BRANDOM WHICH IS NOT
[54:44] ANY HIGHER THAN THE devil believes. I
[54:46] get to believe THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL
[54:48] AND I GET TO UNDERSTAND THESE MYSTERIES
[54:50] WHICH THE DEVIL DOES ALSO. I I CAN
[54:53] PROMISE YOU THAT SATAN KNOWS WHO WILLIAM
[54:55] BRANDHAM WAS. SATAN HAS A LONG TRACK
[54:58] RECORD OF LOSSES FACING THAT PROPHET'S
[55:01] MINISTRY. HE WAS QUITE GLAD TO SEE HIM
[55:03] GO. IT PROBABLY SHOCKED THE DEVIL THAT
[55:05] THE LORD WOULD LET HIM TAKE HIM, THAT
[55:07] THE DEATH ANGEL WOULD COME LIKE THAT. I
[55:09] HAD A MAN SAY TO ME, "YEAH, HE ONLY DIED
[55:12] IN THAT HORRIFIC CAR CRASH BECAUSE OF HE
[55:14] OBVIOUSLY HAD DISPLEASED GOD." AND I
[55:17] SAID, "REALLY?" I SAID, "SO, WHAT ABOUT
[55:18] JOHN THE BAPTIST WHO HAD HIS HEAD CUT
[55:20] OFF? WHAT ABOUT ST. PAUL WHO HAD HIS
[55:22] HEAD CUT OFF. WHAT ABOUT PETER WHO WAS
[55:23] CRUCIFIED UPSIDE DOWN? I SAID, "SIR,
[55:26] YOU'VE LET A DEVIL TELL YOU THAT AND
[55:27] IT'S GOING TO DESTROY YOU IF YOU KEEP
[55:28] BELIEVING IT."
[55:30] &gt;&gt; It's a the history is replete WITH GREAT
[55:33] WARRIORS OF THE FAITH WHO WENT DOWN and
[55:35] and we could say ALL DAY LONG, WHY
[55:37] DIDN'T THE LORD PROTECT THEM? THEY'RE
[55:39] THEY'RE ALIVE STILL.
[55:42] I [screaming] PROMISE YOU, THEY'RE NOT
[55:43] UNHAPPY GOING, "MAN, I JUST WISH THE
[55:45] LORD SHOULD HAVE STOOD STOOD up for me."
[55:47] WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CHILDREN OF STEVEN
[55:49] ON THE FIRST NIGHT HOME WITHOUT DADDY?
[55:53] &gt;&gt; How do you THINK THEY FELT?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; OH, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,
[55:57] FRIENDS. YOU NEED TO DRAW NEAR to God.
[55:59] You need to live near to God.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; This world is falling apart rapidly.
[56:06] Brother Matthew was just sharing in the
[56:08] minister's chat this morning about a
[56:10] move that the new American POPE FROM THE
[56:12] UNITED STATES HAS NOW UH BEGUN TO PUT
[56:16] FORWARD that it was Jesus Christ alone
[56:18] who saved the world, not Mary as an
[56:20] intercessor. And he's he's LOWERING THE
[56:22] BAR SO THAT THE SO THAT THE PROTESTANTS
[56:25] CAN BECAUSE THAT WAS A MAJOR OBSTACLE.
[56:27] WE CAN'T HAVE MARY IN BETWEEN US AND
[56:29] JESUS. AND NOW THE US POPE IS SAYING,
[56:31] "WELL, YOU DON'T NEED TO." GUESS WHAT?
[56:33] IT WAS JESUS ALONE. WE BELIEVE THE SAME
[56:35] THING. COME ON. LET'S BE FRIENDS.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; There are things happening in the
[56:41] business world and in technology and and
[56:43] in the markets and things and there are
[56:45] some amazing things going on with gold.
[56:48] And don't you think and I'm not here to
[56:49] give you a perspectus on investing. I'M
[56:52] HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT THE
[56:53] MILLENNIUM IS COMING
[56:55] &gt;&gt; AND THIS WORLD IS ON ITS LAST LEG AND
[56:58] IT'S ABOUT TO FADE OUT AND THEY'RE
[56:59] MOVING INTO A SITUATION YOU CANNOT
[57:02] DEFEAT PROPHECY. GOD HAS SEEN THIS AGE.
[57:05] THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO, WROTE ABOUT IT
[57:07] IN DETAIL, SENT A PROPHET TO GIVE US THE
[57:10] INSIDER INFORMATION. I'M SO GLAD MY
[57:13] HEART IS NOT FAILING FOR FEAR. I HAVE
[57:15] NOTHING TO FEAR. I KNOW WHO'S IN CONTROL
[57:18] OF IT ALL.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; SO, we come to the the THE THE SEED SOWN
[57:28] IN GOOD GROUND. In the parable of the
[57:30] swer, we see this nuance within the good
[57:33] ground. And and AND YOU KNOW, I JUST
[57:36] WONDER I AND I'VE WONDERED FOR YEARS.
[57:38] And I I'm not here today to try to
[57:40] establish this as an uh what I'm about
[57:42] to SAY AS SOME DOCTRINE. It's just the
[57:45] best that I can surmise as a student of
[57:47] the word.
[57:49] BUT YOU KNOW, SOME BRINGS FORTH A
[57:50] HUNDRED and some brings forth 60 and
[57:53] some brings forth 30. Now, I got no
[57:55] problem with that. Perhaps it's that his
[57:58] great dispensational angels and his
[58:01] prophet messengers are hundreds and
[58:03] maybe maybe his his martyrs and
[58:06] ministers are in the 60s and AND MAYBE
[58:08] JUST YOU KNOW HOUSEWIVES AND FARMERS ARE
[58:11] IN THE 30S. I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT TRYING
[58:13] TO SAY WHAT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ABOUT ONE
[58:15] BEING BETTER THAN THE OTHER. THE GROUND
[58:16] IS LEVEL at the foot of the cross.
[58:19] THAT'S REALLY NOT THE POINT THAT I I'M
[58:21] GLAD I DON'T HAVE THE WEIGHT OF THE
[58:24] MESSAGE ON MY SHOULDERS LIKE WILLIAM
[58:26] Brandham had.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; I I'm GLAD THAT I DIDN'T BROTHER THEY
[58:30] BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY PEOPLE SAY OH
[58:31] I JUST WISH I had that gift. He said you
[58:33] don't even know what you're saying. Said
[58:36] it's a razor's edge from insanity.
[58:39] AND HE AND SO I I'M GLAD I DON'T HAVE
[58:42] THERE THERE WERE THINGS THAT THAT I
[58:44] CRUISE RIGHT THROUGH THAT THAT THAT GOD
[58:47] DOESN'T COME TO ME LIKE HE DID TO THE
[58:49] PROPHET AND PUT HIM ON THE CARPET OVER
[58:52] AND AND AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
[58:54] LEVELS OF UNGODLINESS. WE'RE all on the
[58:56] carpet over that. BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT
[58:58] SUPER SUPER CLOSENESS. YEAH. AMEN.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; AND AND I JUST SAY, LORD, I HERE HERE
[59:04] HERE HERE'S THE AT THE END OF THE DAY,
[59:06] HERE'S WHAT I SAY TO THIS WHOLE 100.
[59:09] HERE'S THIS 30, 60, 100 IS WHATEVER GOD
[59:13] HAS CALLED ME TO BE. IT DOESN'T MATTER
[59:15] IF HE ONLY WANTS ME TO BE A 42. I'D LIKE
[59:18] TO BE 100% OF MY 42.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THEN I'LL HEAR WELL DONE
[59:25] JUST THE SAME AS WILLIAM BRANDON WILL
[59:26] HEAR WELL DONE. AND I WANT TO HEAR,
[59:28] "WELL DONE, MY GOOD AND faithful
[59:31] servant."
[59:32] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter TO ME IF HE'S CALLED
[59:34] ME TO BE A 19 OR A 12. CAN I BE A 100%
[59:36] OF MY 12?
[59:38] &gt;&gt; SEE, IF I IF I'M A 74, I DON'T WANT TO
[59:41] SHOW UP AS A 57.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; I don't want to do that. IF I'M A 61, I
[59:47] DON'T WANT TO SHOW UP AS A 25.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE A 100% OF WHATEVER HE HAS
[59:53] CALLED ME TO. AND THAT'S WHERE LIVING
[59:55] NEAR TO GOD, THAT'S WHAT IT'S REALLY ALL
[59:58] ABOUT.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MANY SCRIPTURE
[1:00:04] VERSES BECAUSE WE WE wonder today. We
[1:00:07] could wonder AND IT'S A FAIR QUESTION
[1:00:08] AND YOU SHOULD ASK IT. AM I CAN I? AND I
[1:00:11] BELIEVE YOU CAN. AND AM I COMING UP
[1:00:14] SHORT?
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Of the precious promises.
[1:00:18] When I look AT SO MANY SCRIPTURAL
[1:00:20] VERSES, I THINK ABSOLUTELY IT can be.
[1:00:23] You know, we we we Paul even spoke about
[1:00:25] that lest a promise any of you seem to
[1:00:27] come short of it. He's talking to
[1:00:28] believers.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; We're not TALKING ABOUT A NEW BIRTH. But
[1:00:33] what is God able to do living through
[1:00:37] you?
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Because you're the bottleneck.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; You're the hindrance. I would like to be
[1:00:45] an unhindered conduit for the life of
[1:00:49] Christ.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. nothing between my soul and my
[1:00:52] savior. That's certainly I've repented.
[1:00:55] I'VE RECEIVED THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:00:57] SPIRIT, BUT I DON'T WANT MY I don't want
[1:00:59] the Lord coming trying to use the mind
[1:01:02] of Christ and my mind is can muddying
[1:01:04] the waters. Or God HAS AN INTENTION, BUT
[1:01:06] I GOT MY INTENTIONS. WELL, WHY DO I GOT
[1:01:09] MY INTENTIONS? MY INTENTIONS SHOULD BE
[1:01:10] HIS INTENTIONS.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; THE THE THE THE DESIRE EVE WAS TOLD,
[1:01:14] "THY DESIRE SHALL BE TO THY HUSBAND."
[1:01:16] THAT MEANS THAT WHATEVER HIS GOALS ARE
[1:01:19] FOR ME, THEY'RE MINE. THEY'RE MY GOALS.
[1:01:20] DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY WERE. I MIGHT
[1:01:23] HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE GA GETTING AN
[1:01:25] EDUCATION FOR A BIG CAREER AND I'VE GOT
[1:01:27] MY PLAN SET AND I'M GOING TO GO FORWARD.
[1:01:29] BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, GOD CAN COME
[1:01:31] DOWN UPON MY LIFE AND GO, YOU'RE
[1:01:33] ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO DO ANY OF THAT.
[1:01:34] I'VE GOT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLAN FOR
[1:01:36] YOU. YOUR QUESTION IS, DO I DO I HINDER
[1:01:40] OR DO I COOPERATE IN THE VISION? AND I
[1:01:43] WANT TO TELL YOU AS A MINISTER OF THE
[1:01:44] GOSPEL, FORGET WHAT YOU WANT. FORGET
[1:01:46] WHAT YOU THINK. TAKE HIS LIFE. TAKE HIS
[1:01:48] MIND. TAKE HIS PLAN. IT'S THE ONLY PATH
[1:01:52] TO REAL TO REAL PEACE.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; AND REAL CONTENTMENT, THERE'S NOTHING
[1:01:58] LIKE IT. Real contentment is to be able.
[1:02:02] And only you can know whether this is
[1:02:04] true of you or not. And if it's not, let
[1:02:06] me encourage you that it could become
[1:02:07] true by the end of the service. When you
[1:02:10] lay your head on your pillow at night,
[1:02:12] NOT JUST ANY NIGHT, how about tonight?
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can lay with your head on
[1:02:17] YOUR PILLOW AND STARE AT THAT DARK
[1:02:18] ceiling and it's just you and your
[1:02:20] thoughts and God. And you can go to
[1:02:22] sleep knowing I am operating in the
[1:02:25] perfect will of almighty God. There is
[1:02:28] nothing that will give you such peace
[1:02:30] and safety and rest and contentment as
[1:02:33] that.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; SO THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF COULD WE COME
[1:02:40] SHORT? I I CAN SEE SO MANY SCRIPTURES. I
[1:02:43] CAN SEE BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKING ABOUT A
[1:02:46] MILLION SOULS. He said it should have
[1:02:47] been 10 million. What? He said, "What if
[1:02:49] I'd HAVE GONE WHEN HE FIRST CALLED ME?"
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; NOW, I didn't say it. He said it.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; He's asking a question. Maybe it's
[1:02:56] somewhat rhetorical. I don't know. BUT
[1:02:59] HE'S ASKING THE QUESTION, you know, IF I
[1:03:00] IF I'D HAVE JUST WENT WHEN HE FIRST
[1:03:02] CALLED ME. SEE, and and then and then in
[1:03:05] when when you hear brother Brandham
[1:03:08] giving his life story uh at Angelie's
[1:03:11] Temple in 1959, which is the best
[1:03:14] version of the life story in my opinion.
[1:03:16] Uh it's the one I grew up at the
[1:03:18] tabernacle. They would play it once a
[1:03:19] year and I loved that. It was my
[1:03:20] favorite service in the year. Uh it's
[1:03:23] what caused me as just a seventh grade
[1:03:26] junior high school student to to my what
[1:03:29] was in my book bag was Footprints on the
[1:03:31] Sands of Time. And I would sit near the
[1:03:34] side of with my back to the wall where I
[1:03:36] knew that prophet had been. And I would
[1:03:37] walk around. I'd sneak in in the
[1:03:39] darkness and walk around where he was
[1:03:40] standing preaching those great sermons.
[1:03:43] I stood with my back to the atrium area
[1:03:45] where he comes down and walks down a
[1:03:47] gang way. And he's walking around in
[1:03:48] there for hours after preaching it. They
[1:03:50] can't even get him back to HIS RIGHT
[1:03:52] MIND. AND HE'S WALKING AROUND. THIS DAY,
[1:03:54] THIS SCRIPTURE IS FULFILLED IN YOUR
[1:03:56] HEARING. AND WALKING AROUND AND AROUND
[1:03:58] THIS DAY, THIS SCRIPTURE IS FULFILLED IN
[1:04:01] YOUR HEARING.
[1:04:03] AND I AND I WOULD READ MY FOOTPRINTS ON
[1:04:05] THE SANDS OF TIME BOOK AND I WOULD CRY
[1:04:07] AND WEEP AND other students would come
[1:04:10] up, "What's wrong with you? ARE YOU
[1:04:11] OKAY? I'M FINE." AND I DIDN'T EVEN WANT
[1:04:12] TO TELL THEM WHAT I WAS DOING. BUT I I
[1:04:14] HAD A LOVE FOR GOD AND I KNEW I NEEDED I
[1:04:17] NEEDED SOMETHING IN MY HEART TO CHANGE
[1:04:19] WHO I WAS TO WHAT I WANTED TO BE. I'M SO
[1:04:22] GLAD I FOUND JESUS. I'M SO GLAD I WAS
[1:04:25] CALLED TO THIS MESSAGE. I'VE NEVER
[1:04:27] REGRETTED IT A DAY IN MY LIFE. AMEN.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD I DO? WHAT WOULD I WHAT WOULD
[1:04:34] I HAVE TOLD MY FAMILY? HOW WOULD I WHAT
[1:04:36] WOULD I HAVE TOLD MY CHILDREN? I WANT
[1:04:37] THEM TO LIVE FOREVER.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; I WANT THEM TO HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. WHAT
[1:04:41] WOULD I DO? WHERE WOULD I TAKE THEM? HOW
[1:04:42] WOULD I KNOW? THANK GOD. OH, YOU DIDN'T
[1:04:45] HAVE TO OPEN MY EYES. YOU COULD HAVE
[1:04:48] EASILY PASSED ME BY. FOR THE AGE I WAS
[1:04:50] LIVING IN WAS WRETCHED, POOR, AND BLIND.
[1:04:53] BUT [screaming] I HEARD RECOGNIZING YOUR
[1:04:55] DAY. SERPENT SEED AND PERFECT FAITH. THE
[1:04:58] BREACH AND THE MESSAGE OF GRACE AND LORD
[1:05:02] I thank thee.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham even confessing
[1:05:12] IN SUCH IN SUCH HUMBLE HONESTY HOW HE
[1:05:15] MISSED THE VISION OF THE BEAR.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; HE CONFESSED THAT HIMSELF. HE SAID I
[1:05:20] MISSED IT. IT'S IT'S ON ME.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; He he said THE LORD WAS TELLING ME ALL
[1:05:24] THE TIME TO GO WITH THESE BROTHERS BUT I
[1:05:25] WANTED TO STAY WITH THIS ONE. AND HE
[1:05:27] SAID, "AND THE BEAR WAS THERE. THERE
[1:05:30] WERE WITNESSES." BROTHER BISCOLL
[1:05:31] WITNESSED. HE SAID, "WE SAT AND WATCHED
[1:05:33] HIM FOR ALMOST AN HOUR AND AND TAKE HIM,
[1:05:36] SHOOT HIM." HE SAID, "NO WAY. NO WAY,
[1:05:38] BROTHER BRANDHAM. THIS IS THIS IS HIS
[1:05:40] THIS IS THE VISION." AND BROTHER
[1:05:41] BRANDHAM HAD WENT IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
[1:05:43] and has to come back to his OWN PULLPIT.
[1:05:45] DON'T THROW SOMETHING AT ME. I'M JUST
[1:05:46] TELLING YOU WHAT HE SAID.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; And he came back TO HIS OWN PULLPIT AND
[1:05:50] SAID, "I MISSED IT."
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT'S NOT PEOPLE SAY, "OH, THAT
[1:05:53] PROVES HE'S NOT A PROPHET. HOW STUPID."
[1:05:56] THERE ARE SO MANY PRO PLACES IN THE
[1:05:58] BIBLE WHERE YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
[1:06:00] WHAT A TRUE PROPHET IS. PROPHETS MADE
[1:06:02] MISTAKES, HUMAN ERRORS, AND IT GOT THEM
[1:06:04] IN TROUBLE AND THEY HAD TO REPENT. BUT
[1:06:06] GOD, RICH IN MERCY.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T THROW THEM OUT. HE KEPT USING
[1:06:11] THEM.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD BECAUSE THAT GIVES ME A
[1:06:15] HOPE. AND I THINK, WELL, I GOT A CHANCE.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF HE IF HE IF THIS MAN WAS
[1:06:20] CALLED TO BE A HUNDRED AND AND HE'S MADE
[1:06:22] A FEW STUMBLES AND GOD KEPT USING HIM,
[1:06:24] IF I'M ONLY A 26, WELL THEN I GOT A
[1:06:27] CHANCE.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Israel failed to keep its commitment to
[1:06:35] Jehovah AND THEY LOST OUT ON MANY
[1:06:37] promises of God. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS
[1:06:40] GOD didn't fail.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; ISRAEL LOST OUT. GOD PROMISED THEM
[1:06:46] THINGS and when they didn't GET THEM, IT
[1:06:49] LOOKED LIKE GOD'S IT LOOKED LIKE THE
[1:06:52] PROPHET WHO PROPHESIED it must have been
[1:06:55] A FALSE PROPHET.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; BUT IT HAD nothing to do with HIM BEING
[1:06:58] A FALSE PROPHET. IT WAS THAT BROTHER
[1:07:00] BRANDHAM TAUGHT US EVERY PROMISE IN THE
[1:07:03] BIBLE IS CONDITIONED.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; It's based ON A CONDITION. YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:07:08] meet the conditions. MANY TIMES IT'S
[1:07:10] JUST THAT YOU BELIEVE IT.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; YOU ALREADY CAN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN. SO YOU
[1:07:13] JUST BY FAITH YOU WALK AND YOU BELIEVE
[1:07:15] IT. YOU TESTIFY TO IT. BUT SOMETIMES
[1:07:17] THERE'S THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO DO.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU DON'T DO IT, YOU MISS THE
[1:07:22] PROMISE. AND THAT'S NOT GOD'S FAULT.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:07:31] SO WE WE READ ON HERE. UM, [sighs]
[1:07:35] GO BACK, KEVIN, AND LET'S PICK UP THAT
[1:07:37] 10TH VERSE BECAUSE WE WE'RE GOING TO
[1:07:38] READ ABOUT TAKING AWAY WHAT GOD PROMISED
[1:07:41] AND GIVING IT TO ANOTHER.
[1:07:44] Verse 10.
[1:07:46] AND THE DISCIPLES CAME AND SAID UNTO
[1:07:48] HIM, why speakest thou unto them in
[1:07:51] parables? Now, notice this answer.
[1:07:54] He, Jesus,
[1:07:57] okay,
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; this isn't Matthew. This isn't the
[1:08:01] gospel writer Matthew's answer. This
[1:08:03] isn't William Brandoms or Paul's answer.
[1:08:05] This is Jesus's answer. He answered and
[1:08:10] said unto them, "Because it is given
[1:08:12] unto you to know the mysteries of the
[1:08:14] kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not
[1:08:17] given."
[1:08:19] People, you know, I've had a Baptist
[1:08:22] preacher get so mad at that concept, he
[1:08:25] wanted to fight me physically.
[1:08:28] So, so what we WHAT WE HAVE TO
[1:08:32] UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE world cannot
[1:08:35] receive the things of God's kingdom.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:41] They're they're foolishness to that man.
[1:08:44] SO, SO THUS WE SEE A TAKING AWAY FROM
[1:08:47] THOSE WHO WILL NOT APPLY the word. THAT
[1:08:49] ONE BY THE WAYSIDE. HE HEARD IT. HE HAD
[1:08:51] A CHANCE. He didn't take it. And so,
[1:08:55] WHAT WAS GIVEN TO HIM WAS TAKEN AWAY.
[1:08:57] ONLY THAT IT WAS THE FOWLS OF THE AIR.
[1:09:00] IT WASN'T WASN'T GOD GOING BACK on his
[1:09:02] word. It was the fowls of the air. The
[1:09:05] demons took it
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MAN DIDN'T CARE about it.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; The one in the in the in THE STONY
[1:09:11] GROUND AND WHO WENT ON WITH JOY AND GOT
[1:09:14] ALL PERSECUTED AND GOT ALL ANGRY AND GOT
[1:09:16] AND AND GOT DEFENSIVE AND DIDN'T WANT TO
[1:09:17] BE TOLD BUT YOU KNOW SAID, "OH, Y'ALL
[1:09:19] ARE JUST A LEGALIST. YOU'RE JUST A
[1:09:21] CULT." NOTHING DOING. I IS, YOU KNOW, I
[1:09:23] I I'M SO GLAD THAT I HAVE THE ABILITY TO
[1:09:27] SIN AS MUCH AS I WANT TO AND GET BY with
[1:09:30] it.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Say, well, could you tell us how much of
[1:09:34] that uh you how much sin would you like
[1:09:36] to have? Zero.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT LEGALISM OR
[1:09:42] KEEPING A BOOK of rules and codes. It's
[1:09:45] that God changed my nature and I don't
[1:09:48] like the things of the world. I like
[1:09:50] righteousness. I like it. I LIKE
[1:09:53] HOLINESS. I LIKE IT. IT'S PEACEFUL TO
[1:09:56] ME. IT'S ASSURING. IT FEELS SAFE.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; I'm not living this thing FROM GRITTED
[1:10:03] TEETH. MY MY only The ONLY TIME I GRIT
[1:10:06] AND NASH MY TEETH AND HAVE ANGUISH IS
[1:10:08] WHEN I FAIL TO KEEP IT.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; AND I HAVE TO GO BACK AND REPENT. LORD,
[1:10:13] I'M SO SORRY. FORGIVE ME. NOT ONLY DOES
[1:10:16] HE FORGIVE YOU IF YOU'RE HE'S FAITHFUL
[1:10:18] AND JUST TO FORGIVE, BUT HE WILL ALSO
[1:10:20] CLE THAT'S THE BEST PART OF IT. HE'LL
[1:10:22] CLEANSE YOU FROM ALL UNRIGHTEOUSNESS SO
[1:10:24] THAT NO STAIN IS LEFT ON ME. MY MIND IS
[1:10:26] CLEAN AGAIN.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:31] SO THEIR FOOLISHNESS TO HIM THE YOU KNOW
[1:10:34] IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT THAT GOD TOOK THE
[1:10:36] FRUITS of of of the person away who
[1:10:40] lived among thorns. It was the thorns
[1:10:42] that took the fruit. THE THORNS CHOKED
[1:10:45] THEM BECAUSE THEY CHOSE TO LIVE IN THAT.
[1:10:48] SEE? [sighs]
[1:10:49] SO HE HE GOES ON. SO SO THUS WE SEE THEN
[1:10:53] UH UH TAKING AWAY FROM THOSE WHO WILL
[1:10:55] NOT APPLY the word. Verse 12, for
[1:10:59] whosoever HATH TO HIM SHALL BE GIVEN,
[1:11:01] and he shall have more abundance. BUT
[1:11:03] WHOSOEVER HATH NOT FROM HIM SHALL BE
[1:11:06] TAKEN AWAY EVEN THAT he hath. See, SO
[1:11:10] THEY DIDN'T PUT FAITH IN THE WORD OF
[1:11:11] GOD. SO EVEN WHAT THEY HAD THEY THEY
[1:11:13] THEY THEY DIDN'T WANT GOD IN THEIR THE
[1:11:16] ANCIENT PEOPLE WHO KNEW GOD and when
[1:11:18] they knew God they chose not to worship
[1:11:20] him as God
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; and therefore their their evil minds and
[1:11:24] conscience were darkened so that they
[1:11:26] could never be a believer again. GOD IS
[1:11:29] NOT GOD'S OBLIGATED TO TO CALL every man
[1:11:32] once and he's never failed to do that.
[1:11:35] HE'S NEVER FAILED TO OFFER a legitimate
[1:11:37] chance to save yourself from THIS UNTO
[1:11:39] GENERATION. GOD. JUST BECAUSE GOD KNOWS
[1:11:41] WHO WILL AND WHO WON'T, THAT DOESN'T
[1:11:43] MEAN HE FORCES PEOPLE.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; HE JUST KNOW HE CAN WRITE IT BECAUSE HE
[1:11:46] KNOWS WHO WILL AND WHO WON'T AND WHO
[1:11:48] WON'T WHO WON'T WANT THAT. BUT HE EVEN
[1:11:50] THE ONES WHO HE KNOWS WON'T DO IT, HE
[1:11:51] STILL GIVES THEM A CHANCE. HE GAVE CAIN
[1:11:53] A CHANCE. HE GAVE JUDAS a chance.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; HE GAVE ESAU A CHANCE. HE GAVE HE GAVE
[1:11:59] DAYAN AND KORA A CHANCE.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO GOT SWALLOWED UP BY
[1:12:03] THE EARTH, MOSES SAID, "MOVE AWAY." AND
[1:12:05] THEY DIDN'T.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE?
[1:12:09] SO THEREFORE, VERSE 13, THEREFORE SPEAK
[1:12:13] I to them in parables,
[1:12:15] because they seeing see not, and hearing
[1:12:18] they hear not, neither do they
[1:12:20] understand. And in them is fulfilled the
[1:12:22] prophecy of Isaiah,
[1:12:24] WHICH SAITH, BY HEARING YOU SHALL HEAR,
[1:12:26] AND SHALL NOT UNDERSTAND, and seeing you
[1:12:28] shall see
[1:12:31] and not perceive. Here's why. IS IT
[1:12:34] BECAUSE GOD IS UH IS EVIL? NO, NO.
[1:12:38] HERE'S WHY. For this PEOPLE'S HEART IS
[1:12:41] WAXED GROSS.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; That means IT IT STARTED OUT IN A FALLEN
[1:12:46] CONDITION AND IT GOT WORSE AND WORSE.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; And they worsened themselves as they
[1:12:51] went along. It waxed gross. See?
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; AND THEIR EARS ARE DULL OF HEARING and
[1:12:57] their CATCH AND THEIR EYES THEY have
[1:13:02] closed. Jesus actually adding an
[1:13:04] ADDENDUM TO TO ISAIAH'S PROPHECY. THEIR
[1:13:07] EYES THEY HAVE CLOSED LEST AT ANY TIME
[1:13:10] THEY SHOULD SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND HEAR
[1:13:11] WITH THEIR ears and should understand
[1:13:12] with their heart and SHOULD BE CONVERTED
[1:13:14] AND I SHOULD HEAL THEM. SEE? SO WHY DO
[1:13:16] YOU THINK HE DROVE ADAM AND EVE OUT OF
[1:13:19] THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND PUT A FLAME
[1:13:20] ANGELS WITH A FLAMING SWORD TO GUARD THE
[1:13:22] WAY TO THE TREE OF LIFE? HE'S NOT
[1:13:23] GUARDING A TRAIL.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A TRAIL HEAD. HE'S NOT GOT
[1:13:27] ANGELS GUARDING A PATH. HE'S GUARDING
[1:13:29] THE WAY. HE'S HIDING THE REVELATION
[1:13:31] BECAUSE IF THEY COULD CATCH THE
[1:13:32] REVELATION OF THE TREE OF LIFE, WHICH IS
[1:13:34] CHRIST, THEN THEY WOULD LIVE FOREVER IN
[1:13:37] A FALLEN CONDITION. AND GOD CAN'T GOD,
[1:13:39] THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF KINGDOM HE'S
[1:13:41] GOING TO HAVE. I'M SO GLAD.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD THAT HE THE ETERNITIES ISN'T
[1:13:47] GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SINNERS.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE RIGHTEOUS AND
[1:13:52] THE AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD SHALL BE
[1:13:54] FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA.
[1:13:57] SO, SO WE'RE GOING TO SOMEWHERE THAT'S
[1:14:00] GRAND, FRIENDS, AND IT WON'T HAVE THE
[1:14:02] MUCK AND MIRE OF THIS WORLD THAT we seem
[1:14:04] so unfitted for.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; A NEUROTIC AGE THAT, BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:14:09] SAID, WE SEEM UNFITTED FOR. It's true.
[1:14:11] We're not. We're not fitted for it. We
[1:14:13] were meant to live in a paradise,
[1:14:16] but we we these things have their
[1:14:19] purpose, and I'm going to come to it.
[1:14:20] I'm watching the clock before I turn
[1:14:21] turn a corner on us.
[1:14:24] AND SO, SO HE HE DROVE THEM OUT.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GUARDING. HE'S STILL DOING IT.
[1:14:31] JESUS WAS STILL DOING it in his day. He
[1:14:34] was standing THERE CUZ THE SWORD IS THE
[1:14:36] WORD. AND HE WAS USING THE WORD EXCEPT
[1:14:38] YOU eat the flesh of the son of man,
[1:14:39] drink his blood, you have no LIFE IN
[1:14:40] YOU. THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT WAS NOT A
[1:14:43] DIRECT QUOTE, BUT THAT WAS A TAUGHT
[1:14:45] PRINCIPLE IN THE BIBLE. AND JESUS IS
[1:14:48] SAYING, YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT THIS IS
[1:14:50] WHAT IT MEANS IN YOUR MODERN DAY. AND SO
[1:14:53] WE WE REALIZE THAT HE WAS STILL GUARDING
[1:14:55] THE WAY USING THE SWORD SO THAT THEY
[1:14:57] COULDN'T EVEN AND MANY GOT OFFENDED AT
[1:15:00] THAT KIND OF A SAYING. AND WHO CAN
[1:15:01] BELIEVE THIS? This is a hard saying.
[1:15:03] Jesus never rushed to explain it. He
[1:15:08] never OH, DON'T LEAVE ME. HOLD ON, GUYS.
[1:15:09] HOLD ON. WAIT. WAIT a second. Uh sit
[1:15:11] down. You know, let me just Come on.
[1:15:13] Wink wink wink. Let me give you the
[1:15:14] insider. This is why I said that. Come
[1:15:16] on. It's all good. I love you guys. He
[1:15:18] just let him go and he turns to his
[1:15:20] disciples. You going to go too? And
[1:15:22] Peter said what we all say.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, where in the world am I going to
[1:15:26] go other than this message?
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take me but about three
[1:15:31] seconds to lift my head up above, look
[1:15:32] around at what else is out there and go,
[1:15:34] "No, thank you. I'll stay right here.
[1:15:35] [laughter]
[1:15:37] There's nothing out there that even
[1:15:39] remotely appeals to me." Amen.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; AND SO FOR THIS, OKAY, VERSE 16, BUT
[1:15:49] BLESSED ARE YOUR EYES, FOR they see, and
[1:15:52] your ears, for they hear. For truly,
[1:15:56] VERILY, I SAY unto you, that many
[1:15:59] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:16:01] to see those things which ye see, and
[1:16:03] have not seen them, and to hear those
[1:16:05] things which you hear and have not heard
[1:16:07] THEM. FRIENDS, YOU REALIZE HOW
[1:16:08] PRIVILEGED that the This IS WHY PETER
[1:16:10] WOULD SAY, "YEAH, THE PROPHETS HAD IT
[1:16:12] WRITTEN, BUT WE HAVE A MORE SURE WORD OF
[1:16:15] PROPHECY THAN THEY HAD." CUZ IT WAS JUST
[1:16:17] IN IN ON IN A SCROLL. IT WAS JUST IN A
[1:16:19] SCROLL, BUT WE HELD HIM. WE HANDLED THE
[1:16:22] THE WORD OF GOD, THE WORD OF LIFE. WE
[1:16:25] ATE WITH HIM, SLEPT WITH HIM, FISHED
[1:16:26] WITH HIM, TALKED TO HIM. WE HAVE A MORE
[1:16:29] SURE WORD OF PROPHECY. I'M HERE TO TELL
[1:16:30] YOU SOMETHING TODAY BECAUSE THE BECAUSE
[1:16:33] THE MANIFESTED WORD BUT LIVING BEHIND
[1:16:36] SKIN IS THE GREATEST IS THE GREATEST
[1:16:38] FORM OF THE WORD
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; MORE IT'S IT'S IT'S GREATER AS GREAT AS
[1:16:43] AS THIS IS IN WRITTEN FORM HOW MUCH
[1:16:45] GREATER DOES IT BECOME WHEN IT LIVES
[1:16:47] BEHIND SKIN
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND I CAN SAY TODAY WE HAVE A
[1:16:51] MORE SURE WORD OF PROPHECY THAN MALACHI
[1:16:54] HAD WHEN HE WROTE IT BECAUSE WE HAVE
[1:16:56] LIVED IN THE DAY TO SEE ITS FULFILLMENT
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; AND NOT ONLY THAT, WE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT
[1:17:01] TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOW WE ARE THE FINAL
[1:17:04] VOICE. WE ARE THE LIVING WORD. WE ARE
[1:17:06] THE ONES UH WITH A VOICE TO THE WORLD
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; PROVING WHAT A PROPHET SAID.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; SAY, "OH, YOU KNOW, I JUST WISH WE HAD
[1:17:15] THAT SAME GIFT AND IF WE COULD JUST SHOW
[1:17:17] THOSE signs and prove it TO THEM."
[1:17:19] WILLIAM BRANDHAM did that for 33 years.
[1:17:21] It went around the world seven times.
[1:17:23] Wasn't something done in a corner. It
[1:17:24] didn't prove anything to them. They
[1:17:26] still they looked right at it and stayed
[1:17:28] unbelievers. Amen.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:17:32] The there there was one man and he
[1:17:34] walked and he walked a a life. I'm not
[1:17:37] saying he wasn't a human being like
[1:17:39] Elijah with like passions and up. AND
[1:17:41] BROTHER RAM SAID THAT MANY HAD HIS UPS
[1:17:43] AND DOWNS. ELIJAH HAD THEM. PAUL HAD
[1:17:45] THEM. WILLIAM BRANDHAM HAD THEM. I HAVE
[1:17:47] THEM. YOU HAVE THEM. BUT GOD DON'T HAVE
[1:17:50] THEM. AND THE WORD DON'T HAVE THEM. SO
[1:17:52] SO IF I IF I CAN'T LIVE A PERFECT LIFE,
[1:17:55] LET ME HAVE PERFECT FAITH IN A PERFECT
[1:17:57] WORD. AND LET THE WORLD HEAR MY PERFECT
[1:18:00] TESTIMONY
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; FROM MY PERFECT FAITH.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; SO, [clears throat]
[1:18:11] SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT GOD KNOWS WHO WILL
[1:18:14] AND WHO WON'T, but that doesn't take
[1:18:16] away at all the [snorts] the legitimate
[1:18:19] opportunity to gain what they can all
[1:18:22] the way. I mean, that's so that's so
[1:18:25] powerful that God will actually let them
[1:18:30] go all the way and gain eternal life.
[1:18:34] Maybe they were never ordained to be the
[1:18:36] 30, 60, or 100. But but God is so fair
[1:18:41] and is so kind and so loving and doesn't
[1:18:44] even rejoice even in the death of a
[1:18:45] sinner. GOD WOULD LET ALL MEN COME TO
[1:18:48] KNOW HIM. GOD SAID TO ISRAEL, "WHY WILL
[1:18:50] YOU DIE? WHY WILL YOU NOT COME TO ME AND
[1:18:52] LIVE?" JESUS SAID THE SAME THING. You
[1:18:53] won't come to me that you may live. See,
[1:18:56] we we've GOT A WORD TODAY AND PEOPLE
[1:18:58] WON'T COME TO IT THAT THEY could live
[1:18:59] and HAVE ETERNAL LIFE, PASS FROM DEATH
[1:19:01] TO LIFE. BUT GOD IS SO BENEVOLENT AND SO
[1:19:04] KINDHEARTED AND HE'S NOT A OLD DOEY
[1:19:06] GRANDPA LIKE ME. HE'S HE'S HE'S VERY
[1:19:08] MUCH UH UH ABOUT HIS WORD AND YOU GOT TO
[1:19:11] KEEP IT. BUT LISTEN, IF YOU'LL JUST WALK
[1:19:15] TOWARD HIM AND GET CLOSE TO HIM, HE'LL
[1:19:18] NOT ONLY GIVE YOU THE WORD TO BELIEVE,
[1:19:19] HE'LL GIVE YOU THE FAITH TO BELIEVE IT.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; You can't lose. IT'S A SLAM DUNK. WHO
[1:19:25] WOULDN'T TAKE THIS KIND OF DEAL,
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; BUT YET, THE WORLD IN MASS does not,
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; And because of that, they will not be
[1:19:33] able to impugn the king when he sits on
[1:19:35] the throne in judgment. Nobody will, as
[1:19:37] I've said to you before, you don't hear
[1:19:39] it. You don't, you know, they they make
[1:19:41] a little bit of an appeal. Hey, we did
[1:19:43] all these things in your name. And he'll
[1:19:44] just say, well, but I never knew you.
[1:19:46] Your hearts were full of iniquity. You
[1:19:49] notice that they don't re rebut that.
[1:19:52] There's nobody marching. There's nobody
[1:19:54] holding up signs. There's no
[1:19:55] demonstration.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; You know, they just go bow their head
[1:19:58] and go quietly away to their to their
[1:20:00] fate because they know they earned it.
[1:20:02] Well,
[1:20:03] sin pays wages, friends.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; It ain't wages you want to collect, but
[1:20:08] the problem is you can't avoid them.
[1:20:11] So you talk about God going to the wall
[1:20:14] in justice and fairness even will uh
[1:20:18] give them the opportunity to save
[1:20:19] themselves from destruction and even
[1:20:21] ARRIVE AT THE JUDGMENT BAR WHERE there's
[1:20:23] no mercy
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; and give them eternal life.
[1:20:28] SO WHO'S GOING TO BLAME GOD IF PEOPLE
[1:20:30] END UP IN HELL OR END UP IN A LAKE OF
[1:20:31] FIRE? WHO COULD LITERALLY RAISE AN
[1:20:35] OBJECTION TO THIS KIND OF A KING
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; WHO GAVE THEM EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND THEY
[1:20:40] STEPPED OVER EVERY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID
[1:20:43] IF YOU GO TO HELL YOU'LL STEP FIGHT YOUR
[1:20:44] WAY EVERY STEP BECAUSE CHRIST WILL PUT
[1:20:47] EVERY KIND OF BARRICADE AND YOU GOT TO
[1:20:48] KICK IT ASIDE AND STEP OVER IT BECAUSE
[1:20:50] YOU WANT WHAT YOU WANT when you want it
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; see
[1:20:55] SO WE UNDERSTAND ALL RIGHT WE UNDERSTAND
[1:20:58] these things the you know the the real
[1:21:01] kicker is that ALTHOUGH HIS IT'S TRUE
[1:21:04] THAT HIS FAMILY can't be lost because
[1:21:06] their names are in the lamb's book of
[1:21:08] life and and it is true that they have
[1:21:10] passed from death to life, they can
[1:21:12] actually never come into the judgment.
[1:21:14] Their sins went before them in Christ.
[1:21:16] It's all settled when they get there.
[1:21:18] BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE THINGS GOD WANTED
[1:21:20] TO DO IN OUR lives had we only been
[1:21:23] willing to live nearer to him?
[1:21:30] Can I carry on?
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Now I'm coming coming a little closer to
[1:21:35] my burden.
[1:21:39] An easy life. That is when I say an easy
[1:21:41] life that means comfort uh without
[1:21:45] friction. That's the way I want to word
[1:21:47] it to you today.
[1:21:50] Comfort without friction
[1:21:53] will literally insulate you and it'll
[1:21:56] protect you from God's sharpening
[1:21:59] process.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; I'll say that again. A life of ease and
[1:22:05] comfort will protect you from God's
[1:22:08] sharpening process
[1:22:11] and allow and you will languish and in
[1:22:14] levels of failure that you will never
[1:22:17] escape, never overcome, never get the
[1:22:19] victory over and you'll see the family
[1:22:22] of God all around you growing forward.
[1:22:24] And you'll long because you're a son of
[1:22:25] God, too. You're a daughter of God for
[1:22:28] real. You are truly you are a believer.
[1:22:30] But you but you surren you insulate
[1:22:32] yourself and you you move away
[1:22:35] from his sharpening PROCESS WHICH IS THE
[1:22:39] SAME THING AS moving away from him.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; That's a big point. That's an important
[1:22:46] point.
[1:22:48] And even believers choose it all too
[1:22:50] often or you know at least we get too
[1:22:53] comfortable.
[1:22:55] You know, here we are climbing to Mount
[1:22:57] Zion and sometimes we find a ledge
[1:22:59] that's pretty comfortable and we just
[1:23:01] stay there and and decide to stop
[1:23:03] climbing.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, why should I?" Cuz the
[1:23:06] age is getting worse.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; You understand? You know, if if if a
[1:23:12] flood is coming in and and I get
[1:23:15] comfortable on a 20ft ledge and and it's
[1:23:18] a 30ft tidal surge, I better be higher
[1:23:20] than 20t.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; You understand? So, this is why I'm
[1:23:24] always saying, reach up, grab you a
[1:23:26] higher handhold, and pull your cell
[1:23:27] phone up. Keep climbing.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT HOME YET. THE
[1:23:31] WORLD'S GETTING WORSE. KEEP CLIMBING.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; DON'T GET COMFORTABLE IN LEODYSIA.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO YOU MIGHT GET RELIEF WHEN YOU
[1:23:41] PRAY for a life of ease and comfort. You
[1:23:44] can get some relief, but you'll you're
[1:23:46] certainly not going to grow virtue.
[1:23:48] You're certainly not going to grow
[1:23:49] stability. And by no means will you grow
[1:23:51] spiritual maturity. No way.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; You know, people think sometimes that
[1:24:00] Oh, you know, I just want to if I just
[1:24:03] had a life on a 90 foot yacht, fully
[1:24:06] crewed and sailed the Caribbean all my
[1:24:08] life with billions of dollars, you know,
[1:24:10] uh I could avoid all the pain and all
[1:24:12] the troubles of the world, you know. But
[1:24:14] can I say to you today, friends, that
[1:24:16] that that that's only delaying the final
[1:24:20] end. That's just a baby cradle rocking
[1:24:22] you to sleep heading toward the fall.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; The whole world is ending. The house is
[1:24:27] on fire. You can't stay here.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; I I want you to understand, get your
[1:24:32] minds around that. Young people, I know
[1:24:34] you're young and you feel like you got
[1:24:35] your whole life ahead of you. You do.
[1:24:38] Could I could I encourage you TO MAKE IT
[1:24:40] BEYOND 70 YEARS, you know, or or or 70
[1:24:43] PLUS 10 MORE OR 20 MORE? BECAUSE EVEN IF
[1:24:47] EVENTUALLY WE ALL DIE OR WE ALL GO IN A
[1:24:50] RAPTURE.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT. SO IF THAT'S THE
[1:24:55] CASE, THEN WHILE I'M HERE, LET ME TAKE
[1:24:57] ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE ETERNAL LIFE I CAN
[1:25:00] CUZ I'D LIKE TO LIVE FOREVER.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:06] you know, um
[1:25:10] I remember years ago I I was preaching
[1:25:13] on, you know, where where Jesus talks
[1:25:17] about a rich man and and he said it's
[1:25:19] it's, you know, it's seemingly
[1:25:21] impossible uh because it you'd be easier
[1:25:24] to, you know, crawl through the eye uh a
[1:25:26] camel to crawl through the eye of a
[1:25:28] needle than to for a rich man to enter
[1:25:30] into the kingdom of heaven. And I
[1:25:33] remember saying just as a young
[1:25:34] preacher, you know, probably didn't
[1:25:36] realize how impetuous I sounded, but I
[1:25:39] said, "It's amazing to me why everybody
[1:25:42] seems to want to be that which Jesus
[1:25:45] said would be almost impossible to go to
[1:25:46] heaven as [laughter]
[1:25:50] what what is it you're chasing?" See, so
[1:25:53] the the the the apostle talks about um
[1:25:57] you know the many have pierced
[1:25:59] themselves through pierced themselves
[1:26:01] through with riches.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; See, SO SO SO WE REALIZE THEN that
[1:26:08] that 1 Corinthians 1:26, if you can, you
[1:26:12] don't have to catch it, but you can
[1:26:14] Kevin. 1 Corinthians 1:26,
[1:26:17] "For ye see your calling, brethren, how
[1:26:21] that not many wise men after the flesh."
[1:26:24] There's nothing wrong with being a wise
[1:26:25] man, but when you're a wise man after
[1:26:27] the flesh, you the only way you can be
[1:26:29] that is when you deny the supernatural.
[1:26:32] [sighs and gasps]
[1:26:32] For you see your calling, brethren, how
[1:26:34] that not many wise men after the flesh,
[1:26:37] not many mighty, not many noble are
[1:26:39] called. Yes.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; See, uh, James 2 and5, it's just a, you
[1:26:44] don't have to try to keep up, Kevin. I'm
[1:26:46] going to go fast. James 2 and5. Hearken,
[1:26:49] my beloved brethren. Hath not God chosen
[1:26:52] the poor of this world, rich in faith,
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath
[1:26:58] promised to them that love him? Back to
[1:27:00] 1 Corinthians 1:27-28.
[1:27:03] But God hath chosen the foolish things
[1:27:05] of the world to confound the wise. And
[1:27:08] God hath chosen the weak things of the
[1:27:10] world to confound the things which are
[1:27:12] mighty, and base things of the world,
[1:27:15] and things which are despised, hath God
[1:27:17] chosen, yay. And things which are not,
[1:27:20] to bring to not things that are. Now,
[1:27:23] the man who's gonna WHO'S GOING TO RUN
[1:27:25] AFTER THE world would read this these
[1:27:28] two verses right here. base things of
[1:27:30] the world and THINGS WHICH ARE DESPISED
[1:27:32] hath God chosen. And people who want
[1:27:35] their cake and eat it too and and want
[1:27:37] their life to be, you know, ONE ONE BIG
[1:27:40] PARTY, THEY READ THAT AND GO, "NO, thank
[1:27:42] you. I got too many plans and dreams."
[1:27:45] Well, go on. YOU YOU'RE PLANNING AND
[1:27:47] DREAMING YOUR WAY INTO A tribulation
[1:27:49] period.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Well, you're going to lose it all
[1:27:52] anyhow.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; See? AND SO SO SO WE FIND THAT VERSE 28,
[1:27:58] THE THINGS of the world and THINGS WHICH
[1:28:00] ARE DESPISED HATH GOD CHOSEN. YAY. And
[1:28:02] things which are not to bring to not
[1:28:04] things that are. In other words, to show
[1:28:06] them how foolish they were for choosing
[1:28:08] the world.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; It means that character
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; which we know to be a a victory, not a
[1:28:20] gift.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Real character. Real
[1:28:25] integrity,
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; real patience, real strength only forms
[1:28:33] when life isn't easy.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Struggle,
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; disappointment,
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; and delay
[1:28:44] are the tools God uses to shape you.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Struggle.
[1:28:53] DISAPPOINTMENT,
[1:28:55] DELAY. THESE ARE THE TOOLS THAT SHAPE
[1:28:58] CHARACTER.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; THESE ARE THE TOOLS THAT SHAPE REAL
[1:29:02] INTEGRITY, PATIENCE, AND STRENGTH.
[1:29:06] THERE'S SO MUCH, BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS
[1:29:07] ABOUT SO MUCH POWER, SO MUCH REAL POWER
[1:29:10] IN THE HEAVENS. WHY WOULD ANYONE ACCEPTS
[1:29:12] A ACCEPT a substitute level for your
[1:29:15] life when the heavens are full OF THE
[1:29:17] REAL? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? HOW FOOLISH
[1:29:20] ARE YOU TO TO CHASE AFTER THE WORLD
[1:29:23] THAT'S PERISHING AND IGNORING THE THE
[1:29:26] DIVINE AND the righteous and THE ETERNAL
[1:29:29] THINGS THAT GOD HAS AND THE WAY HE WANTS
[1:29:31] TO BUILD REAL CHARACTER. IT YOU KNOW
[1:29:34] WHEN I SEE THAT IT IT CLEARLY SHOWS ME
[1:29:37] THAT YOU HAVE A VERY DISTANT VISION OF
[1:29:39] HEAVEN. RIGHT. AMEN.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; You have a a distant vision of what
[1:29:49] heaven will be in the world to come. If
[1:29:52] God if you would allow the Holy Spirit
[1:29:54] to really crystallize your vision of of
[1:29:57] the next world coming, the next life
[1:30:00] coming. You you young people have grown
[1:30:03] up into adults and married and got
[1:30:04] children now and been hearing Brother
[1:30:06] Jason say for years for decades, this
[1:30:08] life ain't about this life. It's about
[1:30:11] the next one.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; AND SO WHEN YOU'VE GOT A DISTANT VISION
[1:30:15] OF of heaven and what the world to come
[1:30:18] will be, then then THEN YOU SHOULD
[1:30:21] UNDERSTAND WHY GOD BURDENED MY HEART
[1:30:23] TODAY. THAT GOD WANTS TO DRAW US NEAR TO
[1:30:26] HIM,
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; NOT HAVE A DISTANT VISION OF WHAT HEAVEN
[1:30:30] IS JUST, YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT
[1:30:32] THAT I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE
[1:30:34] BIBLE. WHEN MOSES CAME AND THE AND THE
[1:30:37] FIRE CAME DOWN ON THE MOUNTAIN, MOSES
[1:30:38] SAID, "NOW, THE NEXT DAY, COME NEAR,
[1:30:41] COME CLOSE." AND WHEN THAT HAPPENED, THE
[1:30:43] PEOPLE RECOILED AND RAN BACK AND MOSES
[1:30:45] PLEADED WITH HIM, "NO, NO, NO, NO. DON'T
[1:30:47] GO AWAY FROM HIM. Come close to him. HE
[1:30:50] WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. YOU'RE GOING TO BE
[1:30:52] HIS COVENANT PEOPLE." NO, NO, MOSES.
[1:30:54] That's pretty scary. That's a lot. I
[1:30:56] don't think I can live up to that. You
[1:30:58] just go be a holy man for us and just
[1:31:00] tell us what he said. And that's what
[1:31:01] the world does today. Friends, that is
[1:31:03] not the family of God. THE FAMILY OF GOD
[1:31:05] wants to move close to him.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; AND I KNOW SOMETIMES IT CAN MAKE YOUR
[1:31:10] life look scary and it can make you have
[1:31:12] anxiety because YOU DON'T KNOW HOW AM I
[1:31:14] GOING TO EAT AND HOW WHAT AM I GOING TO
[1:31:16] WEAR? AND JESUS SAID, WHY WOULD YOU
[1:31:17] WORRY ABOUT THAT? YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER
[1:31:19] KNOWS THE THINGS YOU HAVE NEED OF.
[1:31:22] DO DOES THE SPARROW WORRY? DOES THE LILY
[1:31:25] WORRY? OH, YOU'RE AND HOW MUCH MORE ARE
[1:31:28] YOU THAN A SPARROW to God?
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN SEE THAT. I MEAN, ELIJAH DID
[1:31:36] THAT WHEN ON MOUNT CARMEL, THE FIRST
[1:31:38] THING HE TOLD THEM WAS COME NEAR.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; I mean, BEFORE HE DOES ANYTHING, HE HE,
[1:31:43] YOU KNOW, THE THE PROPHETS OF BAAL. AND
[1:31:46] AND SO SO PUT THIS IMAGE IN YOUR MIND
[1:31:49] NOW. HERE'S THE 400 PROPHETS OF BAAL.
[1:31:51] THEY HAVEN'T BEEN KILLED YET. HERE'S
[1:31:53] THEIR FAILED CHURCH SERVICE. THEY
[1:31:54] COULDN'T GET THE FIRE TO COME DOWN. AND
[1:31:56] ELIJAH'S GOING TO COME AND REBUILD THE
[1:31:58] ALTAR and call down the fire of God
[1:31:59] according to what God had told him. He
[1:32:01] only did what God told him to do. And
[1:32:03] the first thing he says is come near.
[1:32:05] Draw near. Now you now to IF HE'S SAYING
[1:32:08] DRAW NEAR TO ME, then he's saying move
[1:32:10] away from them.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T DRAW NEAR TO GOD AND STAY NEAR
[1:32:16] THE WORLD. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
[1:32:20] BROTHER BRANDHAM IN IN DEEP CALL IT TO
[1:32:22] THE DEEP. He'll say, "Uh, is this the
[1:32:25] patient?" Yeah. He says this. He says,
[1:32:27] "All right, come near sister." He says,
[1:32:29] "Now," and she steps forward. Now, that
[1:32:31] won't hurt you. See, that's just his
[1:32:34] presence. SO, SO YOU KNOW, WE WE CAN SEE
[1:32:37] this whole idea OF GOD IS TRYING TO
[1:32:41] BRING HIS REALITY. I MEAN, LISTEN
[1:32:43] FRIENDS, DO YOU REALIZE THAT THE MESSAGE
[1:32:46] IS NOT IT'S NOT JUST A A COLLECTION of
[1:32:48] books and tapes and quotes. You know,
[1:32:50] it's a person.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; You know, IT'S IT'S THE WORD TRYING TO
[1:32:53] HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU. I IT'S
[1:32:56] IT'S GOD [screaming] SENT THIS MESSAGE
[1:32:58] TO DRAW YOU NEAR TO HIM.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Psalms Let's look at some OF THE
[1:33:05] EXAMPLES. PSALM 69, brother Kev. Uh,
[1:33:09] verses 15 to 18.
[1:33:12] Let not the water flood overflow me,
[1:33:16] neither let the deep swallow me up, AND
[1:33:18] LET NOT THE PIT SHUT HER MOUTH upon me.
[1:33:21] HEAR ME, OH LORD, FOR THY LOVING
[1:33:23] KINDNESS is good. Turn unto me according
[1:33:26] to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
[1:33:29] HIDE NOT THY FACE from thy servant, for
[1:33:31] I am in trouble. Hear me speedily. Draw
[1:33:35] nigh unto my soul and redeem it.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Draw nigh unto my soul
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; and redeem it.
[1:33:46] Um
[1:33:48] Psalms 119, brother Kevin and verses
[1:33:52] 145. I'm going to catch some from the
[1:33:54] KJV and I'll catch some from the NLT and
[1:33:56] a couple from the AM. So you you'll read
[1:33:58] these first through uh with me, but I'll
[1:34:01] move quickly to other ones. Now Psalms
[1:34:03] 119 145 and 146 I 146 I cried with my
[1:34:08] whole heart.
[1:34:10] Hear me, oh Lord, I will keep thy
[1:34:13] statutes. I have cried unto thee, save
[1:34:17] me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
[1:34:20] Verse 147 and 148 from the New Living
[1:34:23] Translation. I rise early before the sun
[1:34:26] is up. I CRY OUT FOR HELP AND PUT MY
[1:34:30] HOPE IN YOUR WORDS. I STAY AWAKE THROUGH
[1:34:33] THE NIGHT THINKING ABOUT YOUR PROMISE.
[1:34:36] Verses 149, 150, 151 FROM THE AMPLIFIED.
[1:34:40] HEAR MY VOICE ACCORDING TO YOUR
[1:34:42] STEADFAST LOVE, O LORD. Quicken me and
[1:34:44] give ME LIFE ACCORDING TO YOUR RIGHTEOUS
[1:34:47] DECREES.
[1:34:48] THEY DRAW NEAR WHO FOLLOW AFTER wrong
[1:34:52] thinking and persecute me with
[1:34:54] wickedness. THEY ARE FAR FROM YOUR LAW.
[1:34:58] YOU are near, O Lord, nearer to me THAN
[1:35:01] MY FOES, AND ALL YOUR COMMANDMENTS ARE
[1:35:04] TRUTH. YOU UNDERSTAND THE THE WORD PLAY
[1:35:06] ABOUT BEING FAR FROM GOD. IF YOU'RE FAR
[1:35:08] FROM GOD, YOU'RE NEAR THE DEVIL.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE FAR FROM THE DEVIL, YOU'RE
[1:35:12] NEAR GOD. THERE'S ONLY TWO POWERS.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; SO, SO WE FIND THEN THAT GROWTH AND EASE
[1:35:19] ARE OPPOSITE in nature.
[1:35:23] Growth and ease
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; are opposite
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; in nature. Asking for one
[1:35:30] uh at least in a certain measure is a is
[1:35:34] a willingness to decline the other.
[1:35:37] I'll say it again. Growth, spiritual
[1:35:39] growth or ease.
[1:35:43] Asking for one
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; in a certain measure is a willingness to
[1:35:49] decline the other. If I'm going to ask
[1:35:51] for growth, I've got to be willing to
[1:35:54] accept at least in a certain measure
[1:35:56] that I'm going to have less ease.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; God's not opposed completely to ease and
[1:36:02] the peace that passes understanding. But
[1:36:04] what what's what got you the ease? Was
[1:36:07] it moving away from God near the devil?
[1:36:12] It's not condemning comfort. It's just
[1:36:14] being honest about the tradeoff.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen. It's not condemning
[1:36:19] comfort.
[1:36:21] It's just being honest. And you need to
[1:36:22] be honest today about the tradeoff.
[1:36:25] You'll find that thread. It's it's woven
[1:36:28] all through the scriptures. You You
[1:36:29] know, you can you can think of Romans 5.
[1:36:32] Let's catch these, brother Kevin. Romans
[1:36:33] 5. You good?
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Romans 5 3:4. Tribulation workketh
[1:36:40] patience and patience experience and
[1:36:43] experience hope. So Paul IS SAYING, YOU
[1:36:45] KNOW, THAT THAT THAT SUFFERING IS
[1:36:48] LITERALLY the the crucible. It's
[1:36:49] literally the the forge. You all know
[1:36:51] what a forge is. And and and that these
[1:36:54] kinds of things that that SUFFERING IS
[1:36:56] LITERALLY THE FORGE WHERE character is
[1:36:58] made.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; See, JAMES 1 2:4, COUNT IT ALL joy
[1:37:05] when ye shall fall into diverse
[1:37:07] temptations, KNOWING THIS THAT THE
[1:37:09] TRYING OF YOUR FAITH workketh patience.
[1:37:12] So, THE EASY LIFE, IF YOU'LL NOTICE, LET
[1:37:14] LET LET'S LET'S READ 2, THREE, and four
[1:37:16] in in their entirety. Go back to go back
[1:37:18] to verse two, my brethren. Now, I want
[1:37:22] you to I want you to notice what you're
[1:37:24] not going to hear. You're you're not
[1:37:27] going to hear anything about the easy
[1:37:30] life.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; It's going to be vacant. My brethren,
[1:37:34] count it all joy when you follow it fall
[1:37:38] into diverse temptations. Verse three,
[1:37:41] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:37:43] faith workketh patience. Verse four, but
[1:37:46] let patience, let it, allow it, permit
[1:37:49] it,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; because you might, you might decide not
[1:37:52] to.
[1:37:53] Let patience have her perfect work. You
[1:37:56] understand? She's working on you,
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Let patience have her perfect work that
[1:38:03] she that ye may be perfect and entire,
[1:38:07] wanting nothing.
[1:38:09] Oh my goodness. SO, WE NOTICE THAT THE
[1:38:13] EASY LIFE DOESN'T GET mentioned because
[1:38:16] the easy life teaches nothing.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; The easy life teaches nothing. That's
[1:38:24] why it's not in those verses. Hebrews 12
[1:38:28] verse 11.
[1:38:31] Here's here's the Apostle Paul being
[1:38:33] very honest. He's going to say what we
[1:38:37] would be afraid to say, but Paul has
[1:38:38] said it, so we can say it. Hebrews
[1:38:41] 12:11. No chastening for the present
[1:38:43] seemth to be joyous. Oh my goodness. Did
[1:38:46] he say that out loud? He wrote in a
[1:38:48] book.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; NO CHASTENING FOR THE PRESENT SEEMTH TO
[1:38:52] BE JOYOUS, but grievous. Let's just BE
[1:38:54] REAL. LET'S BE HONEST. COME ON. LET'S BE
[1:38:57] HONEST. LET'S BE REAL. NO CHASTENING FOR
[1:39:00] THE PRESENT SEEMTH TO BE JOYOUS, BUT
[1:39:02] GRIEVOUS. NEVERTHELESS,
[1:39:04] EVEN IN SPITE OF, ALTHOUGH THAT'S TRUE,
[1:39:07] AFTERWARD, it yieldeth the peaceable
[1:39:10] fruit of righteousness.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; I'LL I'LL TAKE THAT KIND OF A PAYMENT
[1:39:14] PLAN. A LITTLE PAIN NOW FOR A LOT OF
[1:39:15] PEACE LATER.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; First Peter 17.
[1:39:22] Faith. Now, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FAITH
[1:39:24] TRIED BY FIRE. 1 PETER 1:7. LET'S LET'S
[1:39:27] let's I want to read it together. It's a
[1:39:30] short verse. Catch it. We're gonna get
[1:39:32] there, brother Kev.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; All right, good deal. THAT THE TRIAL OF
[1:39:36] YOUR FAITH being much more precious than
[1:39:39] of gold that perisheth, though it be
[1:39:42] tried with fire, might be found unto the
[1:39:46] praise and honor and glory at the
[1:39:49] appearing of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; SO, SO THEN, SO THEN REFINEMENT MEANS
[1:39:55] HEAT.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; And heat means discomfort.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Refinement means heat.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Heat means discomfort.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN TRACE IT ALL THROUGH OTHER
[1:40:09] EXAMPLES OF THE BIBLE. THANK YOU,
[1:40:11] brother Kevin. Things we won't HAVE
[1:40:12] TIME. I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME. And I I
[1:40:14] don't want to I could take you to I
[1:40:15] could take us to Joseph and his years in
[1:40:18] prison. We could look at David in his
[1:40:20] exile. What? Not only from Saul, BUT
[1:40:22] THEN HIS OWN SON chasing him off the
[1:40:24] throne. Even Jesus in the wilderness.
[1:40:26] AND AND REALLY THEY IT WOULDN'T MATTER
[1:40:29] WHETHER YOU WERE STUDYING JOSEPH OR
[1:40:31] YOU'RE STUDYING DAVID OR YOU'RE STUDYING
[1:40:32] JESUS. THEY ALL SHOW YOU A PATTERN THAT
[1:40:35] THAT THE PRICE OF A GROUNDED SOUL IS A
[1:40:39] LIFE THAT HAS BEEN TESTED.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; So you can pray for God to make you
[1:40:47] strong. You can pray for God to make
[1:40:50] things easy. But not both at once.
[1:40:53] [snorts]
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:55] You know, I I couldn't help but think
[1:40:58] this and I jotted it down in my notes.
[1:41:01] I I could stand any one of you up here
[1:41:05] in front of me and I could talk about I
[1:41:08] could say, "Oh, I I see dark clouds
[1:41:11] ahead for you. I see some suffering and
[1:41:15] some loss and some pain." But then don't
[1:41:19] cry pilgrim because I also see on the
[1:41:22] other side of it you get through it and
[1:41:23] the sun starts shining and you're happy
[1:41:26] and you'd think I was a prophet and I'm
[1:41:28] not a prophet at all. I can just read my
[1:41:30] Bible.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; You understand? I don't have to be a
[1:41:34] prophet to do that. You don't have to be
[1:41:35] a prophet to realize that. You can just
[1:41:37] read your Bible.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SO, SO GOD HAS USED THIS
[1:41:42] METHOD TO PURIFY his church for 2,000
[1:41:45] YEARS. DON'T EXPECT HE'S GOING TO COME
[1:41:47] TO THE MOST IMPORTANT AGE, THE
[1:41:48] CONSUMMATION OF ALL THE AGES.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; To you people UPON WHOM THE ENDS OF THE
[1:41:53] WORLD HAVE come to you who ARE GOING TO
[1:41:55] BE THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE AND
[1:41:57] SUDDENLY MAKE IT EASIER.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; OH, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,
[1:42:01] FRIENDS. YOU CAN GROW IN character and
[1:42:04] and and and or you CAN GROW IN COMFORT,
[1:42:08] BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THE PRICE OF
[1:42:10] ONE IS THE LOSS OF THE OTHER.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; You need to take that home with you
[1:42:14] today. YOU NEED TO NOT FORGET that that
[1:42:17] YOU CAN GROW IN CHARACTER OR YOU CAN
[1:42:19] STAY COMFORTABLE BUT THE PRICE OF ONE IS
[1:42:22] THE LOSS OF THE OTHER. Ease never builds
[1:42:27] character. EVERY VIRTUE PAUL PETER TALKS
[1:42:31] ABOUT THE SEVEN VIRTUES. WE START OUT
[1:42:34] WITH FAITH AND IT GOES UP TO VIRTUE AND
[1:42:36] GOES ON UP THROUGH TEMPERANCE and
[1:42:37] meekness and holiness and godliness and
[1:42:38] brotherly kindness and all these things.
[1:42:40] NONE OF THESE ARE THAT BY THESE YOU MAY
[1:42:42] BE A PARTAKER OF THE DIVINE NATURE AND
[1:42:45] ALL OF THESE THINGS WHEN THEY BUILD IT
[1:42:47] IN US WHEN THEY WHEN THEY BUILD THESE
[1:42:50] CHARACTERS IN US I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
[1:42:52] EVERY ONE OF THOSE ELEMENTS COSTS a
[1:42:55] struggle
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU PRAY FOR STRENGTH HOW MANY
[1:43:02] PRAY for strength
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; a third of you
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; well you're like ultra men ultra come On
[1:43:10] how many pray for strength? My goodness,
[1:43:12] I pray for it every day.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; If you pray for strength, then expect
[1:43:17] resistance
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; because you can't pray for strength and
[1:43:22] comfortable life in the same breath.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; See, you can pray for comfort.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; You can pray, Lord, comfort me in my
[1:43:27] loss. Comfort me. Encourage encourage my
[1:43:29] faith. But you can't pray for the for
[1:43:32] the Jesus said of John, what what you
[1:43:34] out to see? you know, a prophet. You did
[1:43:37] you see him in king's palaces and eating
[1:43:39] delicate foods? He said, "Not John. He
[1:43:42] was a man of the wilderness." And so, so
[1:43:44] we realize that that that that every
[1:43:46] prayer that we pray uh for character is
[1:43:51] a prayer for is you're praying for the
[1:43:55] days that test it.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; You and it has to be that way because
[1:44:00] ease and depth. I I read I READ THIS
[1:44:03] FROM A COMMENTARY. Ease and depth DON'T
[1:44:05] GROW IN THE SAME SOIL. I have no idea
[1:44:08] who said it, but as a commentary, I
[1:44:10] picked up on it AND PASTED INTO MY
[1:44:12] NOTES. Ease and depth don't grow in the
[1:44:16] same soil.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; We're talking about spiritual depth.
[1:44:20] Spiritual real spiritual depth and ease
[1:44:23] don't grow in the same soil.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; You understand? AND AND AND SO TH THIS
[1:44:28] IS EXACTLY WHY AND AND LET ME SAY TO YOU
[1:44:30] THIS TO THE TO THIS FRIENDS I DON'T WANT
[1:44:32] TO FORGET IT THAT WHEN WE PRAY FOR
[1:44:34] STRENGTH THEN I'M I'M SAYING TO YOU THAT
[1:44:37] YOU HAVE TO EXPECT RESISTANCE BUT PLEASE
[1:44:40] UNDERSTAND THAT THE RESISTANCE IS THE
[1:44:42] ANSWER NOT THE OBSTACLE.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE RESISTANCE IS NOT THE OBSTACLE.
[1:44:49] IT'S GOD ANSWERING YOUR PRAYER. AMEN.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; I SAID TO YOU LAST WEEKEND, WE talked
[1:44:56] about and I I closed out and I'm going
[1:44:58] to close out with this today.
[1:45:01] We found that WE FOUND SATAN. WE FOUND
[1:45:03] LUCIFER,
[1:45:06] you know, and taking one, you know, he's
[1:45:08] he's got his name. His name is Lucifer,
[1:45:11] but he's the devil. That old serpent and
[1:45:13] the devil, you know, and he Yeah.
[1:45:16] Because he takes titles just like God
[1:45:17] takes titles. And so, you know, he's
[1:45:20] he's Lucifer before the fall. He's like
[1:45:22] he's attributed as the serpent, you
[1:45:25] know, in the fall and and then he's then
[1:45:27] he's the devil. And then when he comes
[1:45:30] into the because, you know, the devil is
[1:45:32] fighting against Job. And then when he
[1:45:33] comes to the Gospels, he what is he? He
[1:45:35] takes Jesus in the wilderness. And what
[1:45:37] is he? He's a tempter.
[1:45:39] See, he's an oppressor, the apostle
[1:45:42] calls him. And then in the BOOK OF
[1:45:44] REVELATION, HE'S CALLED A DRAGON.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So he takes titles JUST LIKE GOD
[1:45:49] DOES. DEPENDS ON DEPENDS ON THE AGE and
[1:45:51] what's GOING ON AT THAT TIME. IT'S ALL
[1:45:52] THE SAME PERSON.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL THE ARCHANGEL, THE FORMER
[1:45:55] ARCHANGEL LUCIFER WHO STOOD BY THE
[1:45:57] THRONE. AND WE SAID THIS LAST TIME. IT
[1:45:59] DIDN'T OCCUR to him when he WAS, YOU
[1:46:01] KNOW, CONCOCTING HIS PLAN UH THAT HE WAS
[1:46:03] GOING TO BE LIKE GOD AND HE WAS GOING TO
[1:46:05] LIVE IN THE NORTH AND TAKE THE THRONE
[1:46:06] AND BE ABOVE THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF
[1:46:08] GOD, BE ABOVE THE STARS. AND WE WE FOUND
[1:46:11] OUT THAT ALL THE WHILE HE'S GOT SIGNS OF
[1:46:15] REDEMPTION ALL AROUND HIM. AND HE'S
[1:46:17] STANDING BESIDE OF A THRONE THAT THAT
[1:46:19] DAVID SAID WAS ESTABLISHED IN MERCY. IT
[1:46:22] NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE THRONE IS
[1:46:24] ESTABLISHED IN MERCY. AND I WAS SAYING
[1:46:26] TO YOU LAST TIME AT THAT TIME THERE WAS
[1:46:28] NOTHING NEEDING REDEEMED. THERE WAS NO
[1:46:30] USE FOR MERCY BUT IT BUT GOD HAD IT IN
[1:46:32] HIS PLAN JUST LIKE WHEN HE SAID TO ADAM
[1:46:35] AND EVE IN IN GENESIS 1 26 27 28 29
[1:46:39] YOU'RE YOU GOT TO BE FRUITFUL. YOU GOT
[1:46:41] TO MULTIPLY. BROTHER BRANDHAM TAUGHT US
[1:46:42] THAT THE ONLY WAY SOMETHING COULD
[1:46:44] MULTIPLY IS SOMETHING HAD TO DIE. AND SO
[1:46:47] EVEN BEFORE THE FALL, GOD ALREADY KNOWS
[1:46:49] THERE'S GOING TO BE A FALL. HE ALREADY
[1:46:50] KNOWS THERE'S GOING TO BE A REDEEMER.
[1:46:52] AND LUCIFER IS STANDING THERE BESIDE OF
[1:46:54] A THRONE WITH MERCY AND SIGNS OF
[1:46:56] REDEMPTION EVERYWHERE. AND IT DOESN'T
[1:46:57] OCCUR TO HIM THAT EVEN IF HE DOES GET
[1:46:59] THE UPPER HAND ON GOD'S FAMILY, GOD
[1:47:01] WON'T LEAVE THEM THERE. THAT HE'S GOT A
[1:47:03] THRONE TO UNDO WHATEVER SATAN HAS DONE
[1:47:07] IN YOUR LIFE AND HAS DONE IN MY LIFE.
[1:47:10] THERE IS NO THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO WEAPON
[1:47:12] FORMED AGAINST YOU THAT CAN PROSPER
[1:47:14] BECAUSE HIS THRONE IS ESTABLISHED IN
[1:47:17] MERCY. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE WOULD
[1:47:19] EVER DO TO GOD'S CHILDREN. GOD RICH IN
[1:47:22] MERCY WOULD REDEEM THEM FROM IT.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; THE CHOICE COMES DOWN TODAY TO THIS
[1:47:28] FRIENDS AND I'LL CLOSE WITH THIS. THE
[1:47:30] CHOICE REALLY COMES DOWN TO THIS
[1:47:33] IS THAT GOD IS LOOKING FOR DEFENDERS OF
[1:47:35] THE FAITH.
[1:47:37] HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO WILL WHO
[1:47:39] WILL BE WHO WILL BE, YOU KNOW, LIKE LIKE
[1:47:42] LIKE LIKE JESUS WAS ON THE SEA OF
[1:47:45] GALILEE. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE CAST
[1:47:47] OUT DEVILS. SAY, "OH, HE CALMED THE
[1:47:48] WINDS IN THE RAIN." He did, but we had a
[1:47:51] little bit of prophetic inner inner
[1:47:52] insider trading knowledge.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; We had a prophet that said, "Well, see
[1:47:56] what was happening was there was a devil
[1:47:58] on every wave trying to drown him."
[1:48:01] See, so brother Brandon, so Jesus, when
[1:48:04] he's SAYING, "PEACE, BE STILL," HE'S NOT
[1:48:06] TREATING the symptom. He's going after
[1:48:08] the cause.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; He That's what the gospel does. The
[1:48:11] gospel is not interested in treating
[1:48:12] your symptoms. The gospel is here TO
[1:48:15] CAST OUT DEVILS. YOU'LL HAVE PEACE AND
[1:48:17] SAFETY IN YOUR LIFE IF THE GOSPEL CAN
[1:48:19] CAST OUT ALL THE DEVILS FROM YOU.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, LISTEN. ARE YOU YOU
[1:48:25] GOOD? I'M I'M ALMOST FINISHED PREACHING,
[1:48:27] BUT LET ME JUST GIVE YOU MY HEART. SO,
[1:48:29] here's brother Brandham in the
[1:48:30] wilderness and a terrible storm is
[1:48:32] coming. AND AND WE KNOW BY INSIDER
[1:48:35] INTEL, BY PROPHETIC intel that when you
[1:48:38] see those hurricanes and tornadoes AND
[1:48:41] THOSE GREAT STORMS, BROTHER RANDOM SAID,
[1:48:42] "SEE, that's a collection of demons.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; They go about to kill, destroy. See,
[1:48:49] they hate God and all of his creation."
[1:48:52] And and he says, "See, that's a that's a
[1:48:54] collection of demons that do that.
[1:48:55] That's why when we pray, we know what
[1:48:58] we're praying for. I'm not praying I
[1:49:01] don't need to pray that God will keep
[1:49:04] those winds from blowing my house over.
[1:49:06] I'm praying that God will rebuke the
[1:49:08] devil and that these things won't come
[1:49:11] nigh unto us. See, because we are God's
[1:49:13] family. AMEN. SO, SO NOW, BROTHER
[1:49:15] BRANDHAM, HE'S HUSTLING TO GET BACK TO
[1:49:17] CAMP. And he said, "Sleet is hitting me
[1:49:19] in the face and it's getting dark." And
[1:49:21] he said, "THOSE THINGS COME IN LIKE
[1:49:22] THAT." And he said, "I'm running back
[1:49:24] down TO GET BACK TO CAMP." AND HE SAYS,
[1:49:25] THE HOLY SPIRIT SAYS, "STOP. TURN
[1:49:28] AROUND. GO BACK TO" AND HE SAYS, "Go
[1:49:32] back." There's a prophet, A HUMAN. GO
[1:49:35] BACK INTO THAT DARK THAT DARKNESS.
[1:49:39] OKAY. OKAY. I I don't get it. Looks like
[1:49:43] I'm about to go kill myself, but I'm
[1:49:46] going TO GO WHAT YOU SAID. And he stands
[1:49:48] on there with wind and sleep and storms
[1:49:51] and demons.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. And God says, "Speak to the
[1:49:56] storm." WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S ISSUING
[1:49:59] THE WORD BECAUSE WHAT WAS THE PROMISE OF
[1:50:01] THE WORD? THAT IF YOU SAY TO THIS
[1:50:03] MOUNTAIN, IT'LL BE THE MIND OF GOD
[1:50:05] OPERATING IN YOU. THAT'S THE THIRD PULL.
[1:50:07] THAT WAS PART OF THE THIRD PULL. SPEAK
[1:50:09] TO THE STORM. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID,
[1:50:10] "I SAY THAT THIS STORM MUST GO BACK AND
[1:50:14] THE SUN MUST COME OUT AND SHINE."
[1:50:17] HALLELUJAH.
[1:50:19] GOD IS LOOKING FOR YOU AND I TODAY TO
[1:50:22] TAKE THE WORD OF GOD AND PUT IT ON OUR
[1:50:24] LIPS AND SAY, "I DRIVE OUT EVERY DEMON.
[1:50:26] I DRIVE OUT EVERY DARKNESS. I I TAKE
[1:50:29] AUTHORITY OVER MY HOME, OVER OUR CHURCH,
[1:50:31] OVER MY FAMILY AND MY CHILDREN."
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; AND I AM NOT SUBJECT TO HIM. HE IS
[1:50:36] SUBJECT TO ME.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; OH MY. THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHY DAVID
[1:50:41] SAID, "BLESSED IS THE MAN UH CHILDREN
[1:50:43] ARE THE HERITAGE OF THE LORD. BLESSED IS
[1:50:45] THE MAN THAT HATH HIS QUIVER FULL OF
[1:50:48] THEM. THEY SHALL CONTEND WITH THE WITH
[1:50:50] THE ACCUSERS IN THE GATE. THEY'RE THE
[1:50:52] ONES WHO ARE GOING TO GO TO THE
[1:50:53] COURTROOM BECAUSE THE FATHER HAS BEEN
[1:50:55] FALSELY ACCUSED. HE'S BEEN CALLED A LIAR
[1:50:57] AND A TRAITOR AND A BLASPHEMER AND A
[1:50:59] CULT LEADER. BUT THERE ARE CHILDREN THE
[1:51:02] THE FATHER DOESN'T HAVE TO ANSWER. HE
[1:51:03] DOESN'T HAVE TO DEFEND HIMSELF BECAUSE
[1:51:05] CHILDREN WILL WALK TO THE COURTROOM AND
[1:51:08] SAY, "LOOK AT MY LIFE AND LOOK AT HIS
[1:51:10] LIFE AND LOOK AT HER LIFE." AND WE ARE
[1:51:12] PROOF THAT OUR FATHER RAISED US
