TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning everybody stand and have a word of prayer gracious father Lord we come before you this morning this Sunday School father that Lord that it wouldn't just be something that I would have conjured up or Lord that we wouldn't have gathered here to hear some somebody's articulation of you know what they think your word says but Lord we we would have gathered here to hear from you father and that you would we would hear something that you would have to say for to us Lord that Lord our souls could be edified by the by the study of your word by the feeding upon the word Lord that we could gather strength from it and father we would we would initiate an act of worship by feeding upon it and saying that that's the truth Lord that we would recognize your word as the truth and apply it to our lives father we ask that you would be with us this morning speak to our hearts and that you would grant me the the calmness and the and the the the ability to step out of the way father father that I could step aside and allow you to speak father that it wouldn't just simply be me speaking or my ideas Lord but it would be you speaking and that there would be a a confidence that would come from the recognition that it would be your word we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen y'all can well let let's say remain standing uh for a moment um want to read um in uh gen chapter 1 verse 26 um this is a continuation of um of the we the thought we've been talking about um previously the last two Sunday schools I'd done um so we'll start here Genesis 1 and 26 and it says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle and over all the Earth over every creep thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth yall can be seated um if you could put my PowerPoint up for me brother Caleb um so I want to as I said before I want to continue um this thought and um this all in case anyone had forgotten um I started the series by with this quote and just a explanation or a a little bit of a discussion about this quote it says um remember Adam and Eve both masculine and feminist in the original creation one but then he was separated by a rib notice but a byproduct and notice the only one of all God's creation of every animal and anything else she was the only one designed this way every other female was in the original creation every other female was in the original creation but Eve was not in the original creation see that had to be made that way we'll get to it after a while notice in this creation that she was in not in the original but a byproduct and in the creation now I don't want to hurt your feelings but I want to tell you the truth and you just sit still you're doing nice okay okay now um now in the original first part we discussed about how this quote so many people get hung up on this feels like it's an attack on women but we tried to show that there was it is not that way it is in fact that because she was a byproduct she had access to Redemption because she had she not been part of Adam to begin with and been separated from him then he never could have returned her back to himself okay and and redeem her that is a ultimately that this is a reflection of Christ the lamb slain before the foundation of the world world and his bride that was redeemed before the foundation of the world and that that is the image of God that they were created in and so that is the pattern that they had to fulfill okay I don't want to spend too much time uh recapping because I'm bad about making my recap the whole lesson um so we're going to part three now um I did want to say something after after part two I you know it I know that you know the topic that we're talking about as I said before you know and even brother brandom kind of pointed that you know noted this and recognize this this can be a touchy topic for people you know this could be kind of sensitive people don't want to kind of hits you where you live um hits hits some sensitive nerves sometimes and um you know brother JD with his sermon you know series he's been doing on the family on the word family which is excellent and everybody ought to go listen to The Archives or actually better yet be here for it um uh you know a lot of times he he he's dealing with a lot of topics and a lot of issues and a lot of things that people don't want to swallow because it doesn't feel good it kind of runs contrary to the way that we've been uh programmed by the modern Mo by you know modern society and so I just want to make a a take a moment to acknowledge something um when we're dealing with situations like this you know and topics like this that we know are going to be sensitive I guarantee you no preacher wants to be the guy who gets seen as that mean man who's just saying stuff that nobody wants to hear okay um but you know and a lot of times it it it can it can you know jerk a little hide off and and leave people feeling sore but bear in mind what The Minister's job is to bring you the word of God right this thing that is sharper than a two-edged sword now you'll notice things that are sharper than a two-edged sword are not cuddly okay it is not soft it's not something that you just want to you know in fact the more you snuggle up to the word of God the more it's going to cut you right the more it's going to it's going to go in there and it's going to start separating things out of your life and a lot of times people have things that they don't want to let go of they have things that they don't want to they you know they they have their their pet thing that they don't want to let go of and a lot of times um God's going to deal with that and it's going to be a little bit harsh if sometimes coming from the pull pit however it's the least harsh encounter you'll have with the word okay because if you don't let if you don't allow the word to deal with you in in in in a Church you know the fine gentle scalpel of the word to cut away that thing from your life in church then the Lord will fire up the chainsaw of the word and start hacking things away and I've been there and I've done that and it hurts way worse than getting your feelings hurt in church okay the Lord is not above chopping your hands off because you won't let go of something okay Jesus said if your if your hand offends you cut it off if your eye offends you pluck it out okay it is better that you go through some serious Ser suffering in order to get rid of something and that your soul be saved and God will do it and so you know as as ministers a lot of times we have to bring the word that doesn't feel good it doesn't it doesn't it's not something anybody wants to necessarily hear in their flesh but recognize what the minister is doing is he's seeing problems and he's he's bringing the word to deal with those problems and now imagine if you know we were walking through the woods me and my friend are walking through the woods and recognize oh he doesn't he's not aware that there's a bear trap in front of him and he's going to go walking into that and so in in the in the moment in the last minute I tackle him to the ground and and then he gets up all annoyed you knock me over and you skint my knee and tore my pants and you know what's wrong with you well there's a bear trap how much worse would it have been if I would have said nothing right you want to talk about oh you know the little skin on your on your knee the scuff on your knee ain't nothing compared to stepping in that bear trap I promise okay you know you know you you'll get over a little bit of hurt feelings you won't get over what happens if you disregard the warnings of the word okay that doesn't wash off so I recognize that nobody starts a sermon like this a preamble like that and everybody's going to ense up no's like get ready right this isn't going to feel good but no don't don't don't get too tense don't worry it's not it's not that crazy it's just the message of the hour that y'all have agreed is the word of your day okay so um now I and I and I say that because I I'm going to be reading a couple of quotes that that are dealing with some a lot of like Holiness and I dealt with some of this last time we deal with some of these Holiness topics because we're dealing with the differences between men and women and how the standard applies right how the standard of Holiness is going to apply differently depending on whether you're a man or a woman right in the original creation God created them man and woman male and female created he them therefor they're going to be different they're going to have a different kind of application the word is going to they're going to be it's the same standard as the standard of the word but the way that it applies to a man and a woman is going to be different because they're under different covenants right their responsibilities are going to be different and therefore uh the way God deals with them are going to be different so um uh let's see all right so this is from um trying to do God a service without being his will it says can't you feel the Holy Spirit screaming out from you oh United States and the world how of I would have gathered you but you would not now your hour has come your God of Pleasure your god of Filth your Sodom and Gomorrah God Has Come among you even our little kids Beetle haircuts and bangs across their faces and little perverts starting out our women is gone it's beyond Redemption our men has become big sissies walking around with little short pants on acting like a girl and hair hanging down their necks we are Sodom might and the fire and the wrath of God Waits For Us woof that's harsh okay not as harsh as the fires of hell that people will go to if they don't heed this but it's harsh okay it says now you have a choice of your conduct I'm going to it's going to hurt just a little bit here see you can go out and let your hair grow down and be a beetle or some of these ignoramuses or you women you can look like a decent human being or you can be one of these weird creatures that we have out there them blued eyes and Waterhead haircuts and things they're completely against the word of God which is absolutely contrary not even couldn't offer a prayer to be accepted that's the truth that's exactly right that's what the Bible saidof that's harsh now to put some some perspective on when brother there's two quotes and these are not the only two quotes is where he says this multiple times he links the the haircut of boys to the Beatles that is specifically somebody that he uses an as an example of an unacceptable uh uh uh perverted hairstyle for a young or any man to wear so I thought I'd look up what the Beatles look like a 1965 to create some context this is what he was referring to okay just in case anyone was confused okay this is all from when he said that okay I hope I don't need to make any more commentary than that um now before anyone gets upset at me or William brandom or anyone else who preaches that understand that we did not get this from William brandham we got this from Corinthians 11 okay we got this from the Apostle Paul now if you want to have an issue with me or or any other minister or or William brandom that's fine but I seriously suggest that you pump the brakes before you have an issue with Apostle Paul okay amen now this is I have this in the in the NLT um and I did this because um you know in in Corinthians obviously in in the in the uh King James it's a lot of translation and it got translated into some pretty archaic English so when you're reading through this it can be kind of hard to follow the wherefores and the th you know whatnots um also in the NLT they when they did the translation they put footnotes at the bottom of the page where when the translators were going through you could have a a certain phrase could be translated one way or could be translated another way and they're kind of synonymous with each other and so that way you can get the full context of what was being said there okay and so what I've done is um where you see everything that's underlined and then underneath of that in the brackets that's the footnote that I just inserted there so you can kind of see how this is you know uh how the the the connotation could be different so it says um I'm so glad that you always keep me in your thoughts and that you are following the teachings I passed on to you but there is one thing I want you to know the head of every man is Christ the head of woman is man uh and the head of Christ is God or the footnote you know could be translated as um to know the source of every man is Christ the source of woman is man and the source of Christ is God or another way to say that every man is responsible to Christ a woman is responsible to her husband and Christ is responsible to God okay verse four a man dishonors his head or dishonors Christ if he covers his head while praying or prophesying verse 5 but a woman dishonors her head or dishonors her husband if she prays or prophesies without a covering on her head for this is the same as shaving her head yes if she refuses to wear head covering she should cut off all of her hair but since it's shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or her head shaved she should wear a covering and that where she should wear a covering could be translated as should have long hair okay now often times in the message we we focus on the women having long hair do not forget that it goes the other way okay that the the standard is the same it is the the word there is a word standard set the way it applies to a man is one way the way it applies to a woman is another way but it is still the same standard and what it does the reason is because the woman is the feminist side the man is the masculine side and they come together to create one whole if they applied to them both the same it would they would if they were both exactly the same then they wouldn't be able to fit together right where you know when you put two puzzle pieces together the parts that stick out on one puzzle piece fit with the parts that are recessed on the other puzzle piece if they both stuck out they wouldn't fit okay if if you know in order for it to be a a a a word unit in order for it to be a cohesive unit in in in reflection of God and his bride they have to complement each other and they have to be different and it means they have to be held to a different standard amen um or rather the same standard but applied differently okay um uh where was I at um I wanted to read do I have any more no that's the end of my slideshow um okay so um going down um and I'm going to continue reading from the NLT here just briefly um I didn't have it up there um is this verse uh stting and we'll do verse 11 here um uh verse 11 but among the Lord's people women are not independent of men and men are not independent of women for although the first woman came from man every other man was born from a woman and everything comes from and everything comes from God judge for yourselves is it right for a woman to pray in pray to God in public without covering her head isn't it obvious it's disgraceful for a man to have long hair and isn't it long hair a woman's pride and joy for it has uh been given to her as a covering if anyone wants to argue about this I simply say that we have no other custom than this and neither do God's other churches okay now in this here you have uh we have quotes where brother Brandon is referring to um talking about women who cut their hair that they have uh no they can't even pray right that God won't even hear a prayer um I actually just now that's another quote that I had that I didn't put up um this is from a true sign that's overlooked says what we need is the go need is the gospel God rise someone in the scene that's right back to the word God said it's not even decent a decent thing for a woman to even come to church and pray with her hair cut and a woman that cuts her hair is a man has a perfect right to get a divorce from her she's a dishonorable woman the Bible said so she's dishonorable to her husband she uh maybe not know it and women will wear women that will wear shorts is dishonorable she might not know it lady I ain't trying to hurt you I'm trying to save you from the a lake of fire and Hell repent okay now here we have the word in Corinthians and through the prophet both indicating that a woman who cuts her hair dishonors her head and therefore it's unclean for even her even to pray okay that's really harsh right that I ain't going to lie that stings now let's turn to Malachi chapter 2 uh actually just if you can put it up on the screen brother Caleb um Malachi chapter 2 and verse 13 um and I'm going to turn there as well yeah King James is fine um actually uh if you have the NLT for that could you put that up thank you um and I'm going to read it uh here I change this up at the last second um so yall read along in the King James in your own Bible and and you it's up here on the screen in the New Living Translation and it says um this is Mali chapter 2 verse 13 here's another thing you do you cover the Lord's altar with tears weeping and groaning because he pay he pays no attention to your offerings and doesn't accept them with pleasure you cry out why doesn't the Lord accept my worship I'll tell you why because the Lord witnessed the vows you and your wife made when you were young but you have been unfaithful to her though she remained your faithful partner the wife of your marriage vows didn't the Lord make you one with your wife in body and spirit are his and what does he want Godly children from your union so guard your heart remain loyal to the wife of your youth for I hate divorce says the Lord the god of Israel to divorce your wife is to overwhelm her with cruelty says the Lord of Heaven's armies so guard your heart do not be unfaithful to your wife okay so yes a woman cannot it is unclean for a woman to pray God cannot hear her prayers when she comes before him with with her haircut and likewise a man who is unfaithful to his vows and dishonors his wife is also cut off it cuts both ways okay let's turn to um uh 1 Peter 3: 7 um and that can be just the King James um um and how much time do I got oh not a lot so I'm just going to read this one verse here um it says likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto your wives as un the weaker vessel and as being HS together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered okay so when when a man who is who when a man takes the marriage vow and he says I am going to be the husband I am going to be the leader of this home he takes on the responsibility to be a leader to be a spiritual leader to be a a a provider and a protector and he's taken a vow to have and to hold and do all of these things to love and to cherish and when he doesn't do those things when he breaks his marriage vow he is cut off from prayer okay that's what the Bible says okay so so this thing goes both ways yes when a woman dishonors her head she is cut off and when a man is a dishonorable head so is he okay it goes both ways and this goes all the way back to Exodus what am I talking about how many times in the message do we talk about a token home okay we're going to apply the token to the home we're going to apply the token to the home and and God will honor the token over your home except the token involved a cleaning of the house to apply the token involved a cleaning of the house involved a the the the household feeding on that lamb okay it wasn't as simply as killing a lamb and slapping some blood on the door okay it the whole there was a whole process there you had to slay the lamb you had to apply the blood and then you had to feed on the body of that lamb you had to feed it had to be roasted with fire there was this whole process you had to eat the whole thing the bitter herbs the unleavened bread don't forget the unleavened part you couldn't if you're feeding on the lamb while you've got leaven in your bread then your token is a fraud okay you you've appli I mean look you take a you take a man or you you know you see this stuff you know pop up on social media or something there's some guy and he's wearing a a military uniform trying to get his military discount at Lowe's or whatever and then here comes some guy who's like wait a minute that's all wrong your uniform is wrong you're wearing a Marine Corps fatigues with army patches and you know if you got a you know thing from the Navy on there because he's not actually a veteran right he's he's got stolen valor he's got you know he went to the secondhand store and and put on something that looks military to the untrained eye but try to get him to walk on base one time right he tries to that ain't going to fly with the real deal right they're going to they're going to spot that a mile away well that's what people try to do when they're oh we'll have the form of godliness on the outside we'll cut our you know we'll walk like this and present ourselves this way at church and we'll look this way and we'll do all this but at home in their lifestyle okay they'll have all kinds of Leaven in their home all kinds of nonsense in their home and here's this this husband or dad trying to say well I'm going to apply the token you what you've done is you've applied a counterfeit token you you've applied something that looks like the real deal it's it's red like the like the blood it's it's wet like the blood it paints on the door like the blood but it has no power to keep the death angel at the door has it's got nothing there's nothing backing it because you don't feed on the word you don't feed on the lamb you don't keep the leaven out of your home okay that's the you know boy we're out of time goes by quick when you're having fun um and uh I'm going to I'm going to at I'm going to okay I'll I'll take another couple minutes um but so it requires there's a standard that men have to uphold themselves to the the standard of of Holiness for women is submission and the standard of Holiness for men is leadership okay there's a it's the same standard of Holiness okay we preach Holiness a lot and typically the way people get preached Holiness is you know dresses and hair and this that and the other well the other side of that men is the are you spending more time on your deer stand than with a Bible in your hand okay I mean there are you spending more time hanging out with the boys then taking care of the needs of your family physically and spiritually when was the last time you had a family devotion with your family versus when was the time last time you made sure your own you know flesh was entertained right this is this is the standard of Holiness that men need to live up to otherwise they are the exact same thing that so many preachers want to preach about women right that's that's what it is now hopefully uh all right I'm I'm going to amen just jump to um hopefully is what I can move into next time um and let's turn to Ruth chapter 2 uh and we're going to go to um let's go to uh let's go to verse six um and it say or actually let's go to verse five and it says and then Boaz said unto the servant that was set over the Reapers whose damsel is this and the servant that was set over over the Reapers answered and said it is the moabi is damsel that came back with Naomi out of the county country of Moab and she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers among the Sheep so uh she came and had um hath continued even from the morning until now and she tarried a little in the house and said then said Boaz to Ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go Thou after them um have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou are a thirst go into the vessel and drink of that which the young men have drawn and she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in thine eyes that I should uh take knowledge that thou should take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger and boas answered and said unto her it hath fully been showed me all that thou Hast done unto my un thy mother-in in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou Hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of the Nativity and art come unto a people which thou knowest not heret for and the Lord recompense thy Work and a full reward be given of uh the Lord God of Israel under whose wings Thou Art come to trust now we'll pause there because I got to quit um but I would just like to point out that later on in the story he takes her to the house that they have lunch together he brings her to the his his you know and he feeds her of his own lunch basically that day and I would like to point out that this is the pattern Boaz and Ruth that is the same type as Christ and the church and is the same pattern as every husband and his wife okay that the way he deals with her is the way every husband is supposed to deal with his wife okay and that involves giving her attention and food okay which I guarantee you will get win the heart of every woman um the and what does he does he recognizes her character and gives her props for her character pins a rose on her for her character ensures that she is feels acknowledged for the sacrifices that she makes and how many times do men completely disregard all the hard work and the sacrifices of their wives that they've made and we think oh well whatever you know I told her I loved her on the day we got married if that changes I'll tell her uh because that's how guys typically think imagine if that's how God treated you oh I told you I loved you the day you got saved and I don't need to move the spirit in your life ever again I don't ever need to have communion with you in church ever again I don't need to let the spirit of God move in a church service and let you know that I care about you and that I love you and that I care about problems in particular ever again you know if it ever Chang
