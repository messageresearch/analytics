[46:25] worked worked except that the Lord stuck

[47:02] the Lord Matthew chapter 12 verse um
[47:06] let's let's just read verse 41 and 42
[47:09] it's familiar to us we've been studying
[47:11] it so I just wanted to start here to
[47:13] connect last Sunday to
[47:16] tonight verse 41 Matthew
[47:20] 12:41 the men of
[47:22] Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this
[47:25] generation
[47:26] and shall condemn it because they
[47:29] repented at the preaching of Jonas and
[47:32] behold a greater than Jonas's here the
[47:35] queen of the South shall rise up in the
[47:38] Judgment with this generation and shall
[47:41] condemn it for she came from the
[47:44] uttermost parts of the earth to hear the
[47:47] wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater
[47:51] than Solomon is
[47:54] here master we thank you for your word
[47:57] tonight there's a blessing in reading it
[48:00] there's a blessing in hearing it read
[48:03] and Lord we've did both and so I'm
[48:05] asking for your Divine favor Lord to
[48:08] take this thought and break it to the
[48:09] people as you've dealt with my own Heart
[48:11] Lord and this thought is one of those
[48:14] that's very close to personal to me Lord
[48:17] so I I just want to get out of the way
[48:21] and allow Lord the experiences of my
[48:24] life to be a witness to the people Lord
[48:27] let me speak freely I pray in Jesus name
[48:31] amen God bless you friend you can be
[48:38] seated now very quickly I want to move
[48:41] very quickly being a Wednesday night
[48:44] we were commenting to you on
[48:48] Sunday concerning the men of Nineveh and
[48:52] concerning the queen of the South which
[48:54] we know to be the Queen of Sheba that it
[48:58] was it was something that they did it
[49:02] was actually something that was a
[49:04] performance of their faith in their life
[49:07] in other words it was more than just lip
[49:10] service it was more than just something
[49:13] they said and we were
[49:15] contrasting that last Sunday as we were
[49:18] coming down near the end to show you
[49:21] that that's really really what this
[49:24] Series has been about because you
[49:26] remember that we've been dealing the
[49:27] difference between logos and Rema and
[49:30] they're both the word of God but they
[49:33] but the when it's the word of God in
[49:35] established form that's the logos but
[49:38] when that word uh moves upon some person
[49:43] and that person becomes a living reality
[49:47] of that word of that established word
[49:51] then that's Rema we've given you example
[49:53] after example our favorite one is to go
[49:56] to Mary and I'm don't not going to go
[49:58] back there tonight um got some more to
[50:01] say on that this Sunday but we were
[50:03] finishing with how that you know Mary
[50:07] picked up the 700 year old prophecy I
[50:12] mean you're talking about something
[50:14] powerful all she hears is a 700 year old
[50:20] logos and and something strikes her and
[50:24] here's a big point
[50:26] it was not something she could reach to
[50:31] herself it because just being convinced
[50:36] of the validity convinced that the logos
[50:40] written in Isaiah in Isaiah 712 years
[50:45] prior the fact that she believed that
[50:47] was a true prophecy just being convinced
[50:51] of it mentally would not have produced
[50:54] her a to bring forth a a virgin birth
[50:58] but what happened is the spirit of God
[51:01] Came Upon her at that moment say well he
[51:03] overshadowed her he did but that was
[51:06] never going to arrive he first had to
[51:09] come and reveal not only that the word
[51:12] was true but she would be the vessel and
[51:16] God would do it and it was happening and
[51:19] it was now and and and Beyond her own
[51:23] reasoning which said this is impossible
[51:27] Beyond her own human fears saying I
[51:30] can't do it don't we say that Lord I
[51:32] know you you're promised a bride and I
[51:35] but I read that a bride is perfect and I
[51:40] just that too you know if if Jesus was
[51:45] standing here tonight and trying to give
[51:47] you the word about a virgin born bride
[51:51] at the end time and you would say to him
[51:53] Lord I just don't see how I can be that
[51:57] Jesus might look at you and say been
[51:59] there done
[52:02] that Mary felt the same way every one of
[52:06] my Apostles felt the same way but I'm
[52:08] here to tell you like I told Abraham
[52:11] I've only come here to tell you what
[52:13] I've already
[52:15] done amen you're my family and that's
[52:20] why you are predestinated before the
[52:23] foundation of the world so it it's
[52:26] something more when when Rema strikes
[52:29] you Rema is not Rema is not in play
[52:33] until you
[52:35] are projecting The Word Alive in other
[52:40] words if it just stays convinced in your
[52:42] mind it's just logos see but but when
[52:46] you believe it then it becomes life to
[52:48] you that's why Jesus would say my words
[52:51] to you are spirit and they are life we
[52:54] read that we might look at that again
[52:56] here in a moment we're going to look at
[52:57] a lot of scriptures all right so so we
[53:01] found that we were showing you that it's
[53:04] not so much what the Queen of Sheba said
[53:08] although she had a testimony it's not
[53:10] just so much you know what the men of
[53:13] Nineveh said it's what they did they
[53:16] repented she crossed the desert she got
[53:19] kicked out of her
[53:21] Society she she forsook everything she
[53:24] ever knew just to go to one church
[53:27] service to hear Solomon and Jesus said
[53:30] she'll rise with this generation and
[53:32] condemn it because she went just to hear
[53:35] Solomon and a greater than Solomon is
[53:39] hereen all right so so when we I I said
[53:43] to you last Sunday that remember that
[53:47] when you read in Revelation 1 and three
[53:50] we found out that the the the the
[53:53] command to the church in the very first
[53:56] chapter is blessed is he that readeth
[54:00] and they that hear the words of this
[54:02] prophecy and
[54:05] keep now you're going to need three out
[54:07] of
[54:09] three see you're going to blessed is he
[54:12] that readeth and they that hear and they
[54:15] that keep the things which are written
[54:18] in the book and we find that when he
[54:21] that principle of hearing
[54:25] recognizing and acting upon the word of
[54:29] God is a principle all through 2,000
[54:33] years and every age you say how could we
[54:37] how could William
[54:39] brandham
[54:41] identify the right messenger and the
[54:44] right movement from ages thousands of
[54:48] years ago hundreds and even thousands of
[54:50] years ago because he used that principle
[54:53] he could look in history and find the
[54:56] single group that didn't just hear and
[55:00] didn't just Anon with joy but they
[55:03] actually
[55:04] understood and then they didn't just
[55:06] hear it and understand it but they acted
[55:09] upon it and that's why he was able to go
[55:12] down through there and say this is why I
[55:15] chose irenius over his teacher
[55:19] polycarp because polycarp heard
[55:22] recognized and acted but polycarp had a
[55:24] little bit of a a mentality toward
[55:28] denominationalism whereas irenius was
[55:30] militantly against that and it so
[55:33] happens that the Holy Ghost is
[55:35] militantly against that against that
[55:38] he's not for organized religion and so
[55:41] brother Brandon was able to use that
[55:42] same criteria to identify every
[55:45] messenger and identify every movement
[55:48] that's why he chose the movement of
[55:50] Martin Luther over the movement of
[55:54] zwingley zwingley was a powerful
[55:56] movement but when it when when the
[55:58] prophet looked into the word of God to
[56:01] see who was really hearing and
[56:03] recognizing the truth of the hour and
[56:06] acting upon it that wasn't swingly he
[56:09] was close no doubt he was a servant of
[56:12] the Lord but God chose Luther because
[56:14] Luther crystallized that Revelation and
[56:17] he acted upon it and it coalesced a
[56:20] movement around it amen same thing with
[56:23] Wesley same thing with a
[56:25] and it it wasn't that you know Wesley
[56:28] was the only fish in the sea but he was
[56:31] the one who who would hear and recognize
[56:34] and act and when you come and we took
[56:36] you there and we're not going there
[56:37] tonight to Revelation uh 202 and uh six
[56:43] and seven you find it saying he said
[56:46] unto me these saying are faithful and
[56:48] true I want to say to you tonight that
[56:51] these sayings are faithful and they're
[56:54] true
[56:55] am and they work and it isn't just a
[56:59] pipe dream that you can become this you
[57:02] can and you are and you shall amen amen
[57:08] he has never failed in any age to bring
[57:11] his family to the Rema of the word that
[57:15] they were the Living Word of their hour
[57:19] this is exactly why they are part of the
[57:21] first resurrection this is why the
[57:23] foolish virgin are not
[57:26] amen see they have sanctification they
[57:30] have justification but you can be
[57:32] justified without being Sanctified
[57:35] Justified of your past sins that doesn't
[57:37] help you in the future it just means you
[57:39] repented of your past deeds and God
[57:41] forgave you but but if you don't get
[57:44] Sanctified you've got to go on and let
[57:45] the Holy Spirit start working in your
[57:47] flesh and sanctify your lives that's a
[57:50] work of the Holy Ghost but then you've
[57:53] got to you've got to completely die and
[57:56] be born completely Again by the same
[57:59] working of the same Holy Spirit in a
[58:01] further work and and the foolish virgin
[58:05] go through justification and they go
[58:07] through sanctification but they don't
[58:10] get the oil they don't get the new birth
[58:12] they're not part of the first
[58:14] resurrection they sleep during the
[58:16] Thousand-Year Millennium they go to the
[58:18] Judgment bar and are judged for their
[58:20] life the bride avoids all of that the
[58:24] bride is seated with him on the throne
[58:27] her sins have already went ahead of her
[58:29] by the time you get there they're
[58:31] already dealt
[58:33] with you don't want your sins to follow
[58:37] you there some men's sins go before them
[58:40] to judgment the Bible says some men sins
[58:42] follow after them you want to be the
[58:44] kind that it goes before you in and is
[58:47] judged in Christ all right so he says
[58:50] here and he said unto me in Revelation
[58:51] 226 and 7 he said unto me these things
[58:53] are faithful and true
[58:55] and the Lord God of the Holy prophets
[58:57] sent his Angel to show unto his servants
[59:00] the things which must shortly be done
[59:02] behold I come quickly blessed is he and
[59:05] here it is again that same exact word in
[59:07] English and in Greek blessed is he that
[59:10] keepeth the saying of the prophecy of
[59:13] this book so now when I've got the that
[59:17] principle in chapter
[59:19] one and I've got the principle after
[59:22] John has been shown a Riv a pure River
[59:25] of water he's already been shown the the
[59:29] the the beauty of of Jerusalem he's
[59:31] already been and now the it's the last
[59:33] it's just the wrapping up I come quickly
[59:36] I've sent my angel when I can read it at
[59:39] the beginning of the church ages that
[59:41] his family are those who hear recognize
[59:43] and keep the word and then I can read
[59:46] that the people who who are standing
[59:49] staring at that pure River of Water of
[59:52] Life and I'm I'm going to be that
[59:56] person and the requirement has not
[59:59] changed that you hear recognize and
[1:00:04] Obey you keep and you don't just keep it
[1:00:08] I showed you last Sunday you guard
[1:00:12] it you guard it that's going to become
[1:00:15] important in just in a
[1:00:16] moment all right now let's go through
[1:00:20] some
[1:00:22] scriptures together
[1:00:25] and I I I subtitled this the testimony
[1:00:28] of Jesus because remember the testimony
[1:00:33] of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy yes
[1:00:35] amen and that's what Revelation
[1:00:38] 13 is prophecy to Revelation 226 and7
[1:00:44] it's showing that this is the principle
[1:00:46] and and it's going to reach because in
[1:00:48] the same book he wrote the church that
[1:00:51] starts is the church that
[1:00:52] finishes and we're going to make
[1:00:56] it good news we're going to make it I've
[1:01:01] read the back of the book the
[1:01:03] requirement didn't
[1:01:04] change I'm I'm meeting the same
[1:01:06] requirement Paul met so that's why
[1:01:08] brother random said I preach what Paul
[1:01:10] priest will Paul's group make it yes
[1:01:12] then my group will make
[1:01:14] it
[1:01:17] hallelujah praise God all
[1:01:19] right so now
[1:01:22] watch so we're talking about keeping his
[1:01:25] word it's a very big topic because a
[1:01:28] Believer loves to keep God's
[1:01:31] word there's really nothing of such
[1:01:35] consternation to a Believer is when they
[1:01:37] fail to keep God's word even people like
[1:01:41] myself who is always a cup is half full
[1:01:43] kind of guy get it from my dad the sun
[1:01:45] is always shining even if it's cloudy I
[1:01:47] just say well it's just above the clouds
[1:01:49] it'll be out tomorrow and if it's not
[1:01:51] tomorrow the next day but even I can get
[1:01:53] way down in the dumps if I don't find
[1:01:56] myself measuring up to the standard for
[1:01:59] the hour in which I live you're looking
[1:02:02] at a man who wants to measure up to the
[1:02:06] standard
[1:02:09] Hallelujah watch what he says here now
[1:02:12] Paul's instructions to the church at at
[1:02:16] thessalonica he says but we are bound
[1:02:19] now we're talking about keeping the
[1:02:21] word that's the sign of the church
[1:02:25] she keeps the
[1:02:26] word we are bound to give thanks always
[1:02:29] to God for you Brethren beloved of the
[1:02:31] Lord
[1:02:33] because uh let me keep up with myself
[1:02:36] because God hath from the beginning
[1:02:38] chosen you to
[1:02:40] Salvation through sanctification of the
[1:02:43] spirit and belief of the truth so you're
[1:02:46] not going to be able I'm sorry if this
[1:02:49] hurts your feelings but it doesn't do
[1:02:52] you any good to believe God sent a prop
[1:02:54] profet if you don't live a Sanctified
[1:02:56] life you still have 1 ounce of Victory
[1:02:59] Brother JD was preaching on this
[1:03:00] Wednesday and brother Matt two
[1:03:02] Wednesdays before that under the true
[1:03:05] atonement and uh the other one on
[1:03:07] atonement and then brother JD comes
[1:03:09] behind and and and just complimented
[1:03:12] those two from Brother Matt and I
[1:03:13] thought tonight this is I could see why
[1:03:15] the holy spirit is doing this friends
[1:03:17] we're almost home and it's God saying I
[1:03:20] need you to be
[1:03:23] ready
[1:03:26] see so watch because somebody is going
[1:03:29] to become the Rema oh my somebody's
[1:03:33] going to become the Rema of that that's
[1:03:35] logos that's established truth but eight
[1:03:38] billion other people aren't becoming
[1:03:41] that but there is a
[1:03:42] people who not only are it but want to
[1:03:46] be
[1:03:48] it oh man I'm going have to keep going
[1:03:50] I'm getting so excited all right let me
[1:03:52] move on weing two he called you what
[1:03:56] what did he call me to to be to to have
[1:03:59] salvation through sanctification of the
[1:04:01] spirit and belief of the truth it's a
[1:04:03] package deal amen amen where to he
[1:04:08] called you by Our Gospel to the
[1:04:11] obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
[1:04:14] Christ it is so selfish to not let your
[1:04:19] light
[1:04:20] shine because it's supposed to be to the
[1:04:23] glory of our Lord Jesus Jesus Christ
[1:04:25] it's so selfish to live as a Believer
[1:04:29] and I'm just going to give you credit
[1:04:30] that you're a real one you're authentic
[1:04:33] you've got a gene you really believe it
[1:04:36] but you live
[1:04:37] carnal you live on the edges you don't
[1:04:40] do what's necessary to stay spiritual
[1:04:42] you ought to be ashamed of yourself
[1:04:47] see therefore
[1:04:50] Brethren Stand Fast amen and and hold
[1:04:54] the Traditions which ye have been taught
[1:04:56] from the NLT stand firm and keep a
[1:05:01] strong grip on the teaching we passed on
[1:05:04] to you whether by word or our epistle I
[1:05:07] want to say to you keep a grip come on
[1:05:09] let's not let this thing slip I know
[1:05:11] it's 2023 and it's about to be 2024 but
[1:05:15] I say we get a strong grip on the word
[1:05:17] of God and say it doesn't change and
[1:05:20] neither do we
[1:05:23] change
[1:05:25] we're serious about serving God he
[1:05:29] writes on further in his pastoral
[1:05:31] letters one here to Timothy a second
[1:05:32] letter to Timothy
[1:05:34] nevertheless I love
[1:05:37] this
[1:05:38] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:05:41] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[1:05:46] knoweth them that are
[1:05:48] his and let everyone that nameth the
[1:05:51] name of Christ depart from iniquity amen
[1:05:55] so the first part is God knowing who are
[1:06:01] his that's the first part let's get that
[1:06:04] straight God knoweth them that are his I
[1:06:08] can't help who walked in it for decades
[1:06:12] and then walked away God knoweth them
[1:06:13] that are his I can't help the critics of
[1:06:16] the world with their nonsense but I know
[1:06:18] this God knoweth them that are his and
[1:06:21] that comforts me because when I fail I
[1:06:24] stand up and I say Satan God knoweth
[1:06:26] them that are his Hallelujah but notice
[1:06:30] the conjunction and right there and let
[1:06:34] everyone that nameth the name of Christ
[1:06:37] depart from iniquity so the second part
[1:06:40] so the first part is God knowing who are
[1:06:43] his the second part is a life that
[1:06:46] testifies to the Redemptive work of
[1:06:49] Christ you're not going to get around
[1:06:52] that it's let everyone who nameth the
[1:06:56] name of Christ depart from iniquity our
[1:06:59] life is to be is is to be an identified
[1:07:03] Life as a Living Testament Amen to the
[1:07:07] sealing work of the Holy Ghost are you
[1:07:12] willing to let your life be a seal and a
[1:07:14] proof to the world that the sealing of
[1:07:17] the Holy Ghost changes a
[1:07:22] man see
[1:07:25] all right he goes on verse
[1:07:27] 20 but in a great house there are not
[1:07:32] only vessels of gold and of silver but

[1:10:48] church every service that's humanly
[1:10:51] possible and I know not every service is
[1:10:53] humanly possible possible of course I
[1:10:55] know that that goes without saying but
[1:10:57] I'll just say it for your sake but when
[1:10:59] it's possible which it should be most of
[1:11:01] the time if you have aligned your life
[1:11:04] correctly there is nothing more
[1:11:06] important in this day of Satan's Eden
[1:11:10] than having your family in the house of
[1:11:13] God to enjoy the presence of God and
[1:11:16] feel the Holy Spirit and let the
[1:11:19] preaching of the Gospel wash your mind
[1:11:23] and wash their
[1:11:28] mind it is so
[1:11:30] powerful I have seen people sit in
[1:11:33] message churches including this one for
[1:11:36] years and they were never born again and
[1:11:39] it proved it once they quit coming to
[1:11:41] church and their life blew to Kingdom
[1:11:43] come and got into all kinds of Twisted
[1:11:45] perversion but the fact that they didn't
[1:11:48] do it or it was extremely limited while
[1:11:50] they were coming here is Testament to
[1:11:52] the washing effect of the word they
[1:11:55] weren't even getting born again but they
[1:11:56] were just coming here and under the
[1:11:58] presence and under the preaching they're
[1:12:00] getting their Spirit
[1:12:03] washed it's a powerful
[1:12:07] thing see but but when parents let their
[1:12:10] own careers and their own activities and
[1:12:12] their own schedules they don't have come
[1:12:15] to church their kids don't have come to
[1:12:17] church come on Friends how's God SP what
[1:12:20] do you expect God to
[1:12:22] do amen
[1:12:24] my I tell you something friends it's
[1:12:27] just time to take the gloves off we're
[1:12:29] too close to
[1:12:30] home
[1:12:35] Hallelujah all right he says so flee off
[1:12:38] also youthful lust but follow
[1:12:40] righteousness Faith charity peace with
[1:12:42] them that call on the Lord out of a pure
[1:12:45] heart he goes on to the church at
[1:12:47] colasse he writes if ye then be risen
[1:12:52] with Christ how many that means you're
[1:12:55] born again nine of you how many are
[1:12:58] risen with
[1:13:00] Christ about a little over half of you
[1:13:03] are you are you born again of the spirit
[1:13:05] of God I need to change my text if I got
[1:13:07] that many people who aren't even born
[1:13:08] again all right so so if you be risen
[1:13:12] with Christ seek the world in a new
[1:13:16] career I'm sorry I I
[1:13:19] apologize if if you then be risen with
[1:13:21] Christ seek those things which make you
[1:13:26] happy chase the world get a little bit
[1:13:29] here and a little bit
[1:13:31] there you know get more
[1:13:35] likes be more
[1:13:37] popular if you be risen with Christ seek
[1:13:41] those things which are
[1:13:43] above what are you doing chasing things
[1:13:46] down here you should be seeking those
[1:13:49] things above where Christ sth on the
[1:13:52] right hand of of God sitting on the
[1:13:55] right hand of God is power no wonder you
[1:13:58] don't have power in your home in your
[1:14:02] life in your testimony you're not
[1:14:04] seeking the place of
[1:14:08] power all right all
[1:14:12] right on the right hand of
[1:14:15] God set oh excuse me uh set your
[1:14:19] affection on things above not on things
[1:14:22] on the Earth
[1:14:25] Earth that Colossians 3 1 and 2 that is
[1:14:30] so
[1:14:32] gripping I could just stand you up and
[1:14:34] dismiss and you could go home and you'd
[1:14:36] be benefited having just read
[1:14:38] that if you would just follow that
[1:14:41] listen friends if you would just follow
[1:14:43] that it would fix probably 99% of every
[1:14:48] problem you've got in your life in your
[1:14:50] family in your children in your finances
[1:14:53] in in in your spirituality in your
[1:14:55] prayer life you're talking about power
[1:14:58] to cast out Devils you're talking about
[1:14:59] power to take chaos and bring it back
[1:15:02] into order because you commanded it so
[1:15:05] do you realize that's the whole plan of
[1:15:06] the Holy Ghost that's what the Holy
[1:15:08] Ghost is given for to empower the church
[1:15:09] to be Jesus Christ in the
[1:15:12] earth see brother brandham when he says
[1:15:15] we we we're Kings but we live like
[1:15:17] poppers it wasn't just the fact that oh
[1:15:20] we we just chose to live as poppers we
[1:15:22] weren't claiming our spiritual rights
[1:15:24] it's really
[1:15:28] be
[1:15:30] see all

[1:18:52] sinful nature and all its Wicked Deeds
[1:18:58] is that
[1:19:00] beautiful now it now it's obviously it's
[1:19:04] obvious that Paul is speaking to people
[1:19:08] in his mind who are born
[1:19:11] again well then if if I'm born again if
[1:19:16] Paul wouldn't be saying giving me these
[1:19:19] instructions if it wasn't true as
[1:19:21] brother Jason was showing us it's still
[1:19:24] true that I can let my flesh get the
[1:19:26] better of me and I have to go back and
[1:19:28] repent again Paul knew
[1:19:31] that I you know I've heard I've heard
[1:19:35] you know and there's there's certainly
[1:19:36] truth to it of course it's true brother
[1:19:38] brandom said it he T starts talking
[1:19:40] about heinous sins and and adultery and
[1:19:42] different things like that and and he
[1:19:44] says of course my Holy Ghost would keep
[1:19:46] me from that and that almost becomes
[1:19:47] like a blanket thing to say really what
[1:19:50] they're saying is you should never have
[1:19:51] a mistake at all
[1:19:54] until you pin them on that and they go
[1:19:55] well no you're going to have mistakes
[1:19:57] okay well then now since you're the
[1:19:58] arbitrator tell me tell me where that
[1:20:00] crosses the line so so you say well but
[1:20:04] the my Holy Spirit would keep me from
[1:20:06] that well of course no kidding the holy
[1:20:09] spirit's never going to agree with you
[1:20:12] sinning he's never gonna he's never
[1:20:14] going to be okay with that but he's not
[1:20:16] going to force you
[1:20:18] either he you you if you're his child
[1:20:20] he'll wear you out and you'll wish you
[1:20:23] hadn't done it amen but I he still loves
[1:20:27] me I've still passed from Death unto
[1:20:30] life see but I'm instructed don't let
[1:20:34] these things rule in your members
[1:20:39] see all right um

[1:20:45] nature and in other words live according
[1:20:48] to the Inner Man let your outer man be a
[1:20:52] represent ation of Your Inner Man put on

[1:20:58] listen friends look at what you're
[1:21:01] reading you put on your new nature you
[1:21:04] can't give yourself a new
[1:21:05] nature you can't born birth Yourself by
[1:21:09] the new birth that of course it has to
[1:21:12] be God to give you a new nature Paul's
[1:21:15] not saying save yourself he's saying
[1:21:18] live the outside according to the inside
[1:21:21] put down love and evil concupisent and
[1:21:24] and don't have anything to do with these
[1:21:26] things bring your flesh under subjection
[1:21:29] to the holy spirit amen make whatever
[1:21:33] changes you feel you need to make put on
[1:21:36] your new nature and be renewed as you
[1:21:38] learn to know your Creator and become
[1:21:42] like
[1:21:44] him brother Matt had this quote I don't
[1:21:46] remember if he put it up I'm going to
[1:21:47] put it up tonight but he was quoting
[1:21:49] from it so
[1:21:51] powerful what he was preaching um his
[1:21:55] two parts there brother B talking about
[1:21:57] the New
[1:21:58] Birth when this takes place the thing
[1:22:01] you'll do
[1:22:02] then you'll find
[1:22:04] out that that the spirit that comes in
[1:22:08] you from the New Birth you here's what
[1:22:11] it'll do you will believe and do
[1:22:14] everybody say believe and do believe you
[1:22:17] will believe and do everything that God
[1:22:20] says in his word for you to do
[1:22:24] that that's that's what's that's what
[1:22:27] the Holy Ghost is given for might I
[1:22:30] sometimes fail to do that yes you might
[1:22:32] not only fail to do it you might be you
[1:22:34] might fail to believe it and God have to
[1:22:37] come down and rebuke your unbelief put
[1:22:40] you through a trial and show you you
[1:22:42] actually believe it more than you think
[1:22:43] you do there's nothing like a trial to
[1:22:46] give you desperation and prove to you
[1:22:48] that you're more of a Believer than you
[1:22:49] thought you were oh my God has ways
[1:22:52] friends amen all right he has ways but
[1:22:56] here's the overriding principle of the
[1:22:59] new birth you will believe and do
[1:23:01] everything that God says in his word for
[1:23:03] you to do there is a big difference
[1:23:06] between making mistakes and even even
[1:23:11] getting overwhelmed by a desire because
[1:23:13] your prayer life is slack your church
[1:23:15] attendance is slack your consuming of
[1:23:17] the word of God is slack your consuming
[1:23:20] of Netflix is high yeah come on
[1:23:24] amen yeah Bible consumption prayer time
[1:23:28] way low way low Church schedule way low
[1:23:31] ESPN way high yeah amen is this okay oh
[1:23:36] yeah amen YouTube really high Facebook
[1:23:41] out of this
[1:23:44] world Instagram all the other Gams and
[1:23:46] all I'm not even going to start down the
[1:23:48] list I don't even know what I'm half
[1:23:50] what I'm talking about on most of them
[1:23:53] but I do know this and I do know what
[1:23:56] this will do if you make this the
[1:23:57] biggest part of your diet I know what'll
[1:24:00] happen to you if you don't say how do
[1:24:02] you know cuz I've done it and I've found
[1:24:04] myself a
[1:24:06] slack and I just found that it I didn't
[1:24:09] lose a new birth I just lost I got my
[1:24:11] priorities I let I let the siren song of
[1:24:14] the world you know sing me to sleep and
[1:24:17] the next thing you know you know you got
[1:24:20] you got days I I tell you I'm so glad
[1:24:22] God taught me that early in my Christian
[1:24:25] experience Prayer Changes Everything
[1:24:28] amen amen prayer we preached on it here
[1:24:31] some time ago prayer is you in a
[1:24:33] partnership with God prayer is not a
[1:24:35] wish
[1:24:36] list prayer certainly not to change
[1:24:39] God's mind from what he would otherwise
[1:24:41] not do uh prayer is to change your mind
[1:24:45] see but prayer gives you the partnership
[1:24:48] with God just like Jesus partnered when
[1:24:51] he said to his disciples the Harvest is
[1:24:53] truly white uh the field is white Under
[1:24:56] Harvest but the labors are few pray ye
[1:24:58] the lord of the Harvest that he sent
[1:25:01] forth labors and brother brandham said
[1:25:02] here he was standing there he was the
[1:25:04] lord of the Harvest and he's saying to
[1:25:05] them pray to the Lord of the Harvest and
[1:25:07] brother brandham said in other words
[1:25:08] Jesus was saying look I want to do this
[1:25:11] but I want you to pray and ask me prayer
[1:25:14] is you in a partnership with God
[1:25:17] hallelujah you can travel the world
[1:25:20] vicariously through prayer for JD goes
[1:25:23] overseas you don't know what he might
[1:25:25] face he don't know what he might face
[1:25:27] but God knows what he might face and God
[1:25:30] is it will will anoint you to hit your
[1:25:32] knees and you don't even know why and
[1:25:34] you start praying for him and you've
[1:25:36] just you've done what Paul did Paul said
[1:25:38] my spirit there with you you have
[1:25:42] literally crossed an ocean through
[1:25:44] prayer this is Supernatural
[1:25:47] friends you literally move into another
[1:25:50] realm what a privilege prayer is I
[1:25:54] literally can move through
[1:25:56] Dimensions while I'm on my
[1:25:59] knees speaking to God I've lifted myself
[1:26:03] up into Heavenly places and I'm
[1:26:04] projecting the word of God I am God
[1:26:08] praying through
[1:26:09] me prayer is one of the most privileged
[1:26:12] things you can ever have a hold of it
[1:26:14] makes you a coworker with Christ see you
[1:26:18] might never go to the Middle East but
[1:26:20] you can go there in prayer you might you
[1:26:24] might never stand in this pull pit and
[1:26:26] preach a sermon but you can by praying
[1:26:29] for the preacher standing
[1:26:31] hereen see oh I gotta
[1:26:35] fly all right
[1:26:39] now all right you will believe and do
[1:26:43] everything that God says in his word for
[1:26:44] you to
[1:26:46] do and everything that the Bible quotes
[1:26:49] for you to do you'll punctuate it with
[1:26:51] an amen amen now that's in your
[1:26:55] life talk is cheap
[1:26:58] amen amen means so be it in other words
[1:27:02] it's things in my life so be it Lord
[1:27:04] what that's what Mary said be it unto me
[1:27:06] Mary didn't say okay I agree Mary Said
[1:27:09] Amen to the word be it unto me according
[1:27:12] to your words I can't produce it I'm not
[1:27:15] the one said it you said it so you do it
[1:27:17] but I'll believe it and I'll do my part
[1:27:20] whatever I've got to do
[1:27:24] Hallelujah
[1:27:27] see everything that the Bible quotes you
[1:27:29] to do you'll punctuated with an amen and
[1:27:31] you'll not stop day and night until you
[1:27:33] receive it that's right that's right and
[1:27:36] in all this time you'll
[1:27:39] certainly above everything bear the
[1:27:41] fruit of the spirit you say will I speak
[1:27:43] in tongues you might do that and you
[1:27:45] might not will I shout you might do that
[1:27:48] you might not but there's one sure thing
[1:27:52] you will do you will bear the Fruit of
[1:27:54] the Spirit and the fruit of the spirit
[1:27:56] is love it's Joy it's peace it's Faith
[1:28:00] it's longsuffering meekness gentleness
[1:28:03] patience your temper will not be oh just
[1:28:07] remember just remember when you got that
[1:28:10] the poisons that poisons the holy spirit
[1:28:13] away from
[1:28:14] you can't control that temper can't
[1:28:17] control your spirit Solomon said you're
[1:28:19] like an unwalled City the enemy just
[1:28:20] walks in and out he ever he chooses
[1:28:24] see so he says
[1:28:27] um that old po that poisons the holy
[1:28:30] spirit away from me it breaks my heart
[1:28:32] to read those words I can't imagine that
[1:28:34] there's been time where I poisoned to
[1:28:35] the Holy Ghost amen after everything
[1:28:38] he's done for
[1:28:41] me when you get to a place that you want
[1:28:45] to uh fuss with everybody my goodness uh
[1:28:50] you come along too there's something
[1:28:52] wrong when you get a place where the a
[1:28:55] minister will read from the Bible boy
[1:28:57] I've had my share this read something
[1:29:00] from the Bible that it's wrong to do a
[1:29:02] certain thing and you'll just remember
[1:29:05] there's no Christianity there at
[1:29:11] all you know I've had people just get so
[1:29:14] mad at me because I was teaching things
[1:29:16] we shouldn't do out of the
[1:29:18] Bible and I just say what I say now
[1:29:21] what's ID there's no Christianity there
[1:29:24] at all that's why they were doing it
[1:29:26] that's why they still do there's no
[1:29:28] Christianity there at all see that's now
[1:29:32] that by their fruits you shall know them
[1:29:35] that's what Jesus said if if it's the
[1:29:40] word uh let's see if it's the word of
[1:29:45] God and God said so that spirit in you
[1:29:48] will cope with that word every time cuz
[1:29:51] genuine and holy spirit will cope with
[1:29:53] the word cuz the word is life and spirit
[1:29:59] Jesus said my words are life now I've
[1:30:02] been breaking that down for you and fact
[1:30:05] is uh take that down brother Josh and
[1:30:09] and get ready to pull up some scriptures
[1:30:11] and do it all super super fast
[1:30:15] amen all right now we've read to you and
[1:30:18] we won't need to go there Josh we're
[1:30:20] going to go to John 663
[1:30:22] and I've we we know John 1:1 in the
[1:30:25] beginning was the logos the word the
[1:30:29] logos was with God and the logos was God
[1:30:32] it's the established word see all right
[1:30:35] and uh and then the logos was made flesh
[1:30:38] and dwelt Among Us and became a human
[1:30:40] all right but when you go to John 663
[1:30:43] Jesus is saying it is the spirit that
[1:30:46] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[1:30:50] the words that I speak unto you
[1:30:52] they are spirit and they are life the
[1:30:54] words that I speak unto you now that's
[1:30:58] Rema see because the purpose of the word
[1:31:01] is not to just stay ink on paper it's
[1:31:04] more than just your mental agreement
[1:31:06] with the teaching it's your willingness
[1:31:09] to let this get written behind skin or
[1:31:13] not and and if that's your decision then
[1:31:17] then I'll just say welcome to the
[1:31:19] tribulation and welcome to the judgment
[1:31:22] bar good luck with that I hope the best
[1:31:24] for you but I don't plan to go there I
[1:31:27] don't plan to get left behind I plan to
[1:31:30] go up when the trumpet sounds I plan to
[1:31:32] be seated on the throne you say well how
[1:31:35] do you know you won't stand the Judgment
[1:31:37] oh I am standing the Judgment everybody
[1:31:39] stands the Judgment Paul said we all
[1:31:41] stand before the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:31:43] that's not the question the question is
[1:31:45] when and where and since this right now
[1:31:48] this is the Judgment seat of Christ then
[1:31:50] I choose Here and Now
[1:31:52] I don't want to choose there and then
[1:31:54] I'll choose here and
[1:31:56] now
[1:31:58] see all right so John
[1:32:01] 15 uh verse one all right here it is
[1:32:05] Jesus says I am the True Vine we're
[1:32:09] going to go John 15 I think 1 through
[1:32:10] eight brother Josh I am the True Vine
[1:32:13] and my father is the husbandman that's a
[1:32:16] farmer it's a gardener it's the it's the
[1:32:19] caretaker right but but most perfectly a
[1:32:22] husbandman is a
[1:32:23] farmer which is exactly that's just so
[1:32:27] perfect of the Holy Ghost just like a
[1:32:30] farmer plants a seed and cares for it
[1:32:32] while it grows keeps the weeds out and
[1:32:35] harvests it see and so Jesus talks about
[1:32:37] you know taking the wheat to the Garner
[1:32:39] and the chaff is burned with
[1:32:41] unquenchable fire so he's a good farmer
[1:32:43] so he knows what he's talking about I am
[1:32:45] the True Vine and my father is the
[1:32:47] husband and every branch in me that
[1:32:49] beareth not fruit he taketh away and
[1:32:52] every branch that beareth fruit he
[1:32:54] purgeth it that it may bring forth more
[1:32:57] fruit no I'm sorry you're you're not
[1:33:00] going to Disney World you're going to
[1:33:01] get purged so you can get more
[1:33:04] fruit now watch now watch this this is
[1:33:08] this is a
[1:33:09] tricky now ye are clean through the
[1:33:15] logos that's what I was saying a while
[1:33:18] ago just reading the logos just just
[1:33:21] hearing it red there's a blessing
[1:33:24] there's a washing of the water just
[1:33:27] coming under and having somebody teach
[1:33:29] this to you there's a washing I've seen
[1:33:32] it happen to people who sat in churches
[1:33:35] and lived mostly Sanctified and some of
[1:33:37] them lived incredibly Sanctified lives
[1:33:39] for decades and then and then quit
[1:33:42] church and as soon as they quit church
[1:33:44] and left the message uh they
[1:33:47] backslid almost overnight breathtakingly
[1:33:50] fast immediately they did it and so and
[1:33:54] then and and then try to claim they're
[1:33:56] still a Christian that's just not true
[1:33:58] I'm sorry that's just not true say does
[1:34:01] that finish them not for me to say thank
[1:34:04] God that's for the Lord that's the the
[1:34:06] judge will make that decision not me see
[1:34:09] I just know I'm a
[1:34:11] Believer and I'm going all the
[1:34:14] way amen watching that clock it's going
[1:34:18] fast now you are clean through the word
[1:34:21] the logos which I've spoken unto you now
[1:34:24] catch this word abide in me
[1:34:30] interesting uh I'm trying to think of
[1:34:33] his name now it escapes my mind
[1:34:36] um oh goodness but uh made made some
[1:34:41] comments got my mind thinking pointed
[1:34:43] out the fact that how that Jesus in the
[1:34:47] early part of his
[1:34:49] ministry would always say to his
[1:34:52] disciples follow
[1:34:54] me and he says isn't it
[1:34:57] curious that right before he leaves the
[1:35:00] Earth and goes home he now he now says
[1:35:04] something further it's not just follow
[1:35:06] me but abide in me amen
[1:35:10] see because see the Holy Ghost is coming
[1:35:13] the church is getting ready his kingdom
[1:35:14] is getting ready to be in the earth see
[1:35:17] so it's not just there are the world is
[1:35:19] filled with followers of Jesus
[1:35:22] but there's a big difference between
[1:35:23] following him and abiding in him or you
[1:35:27] and him and he and you see abide in me
[1:35:32] and I in you don't just follow me don't
[1:35:36] just agree with me
[1:35:39] abide uh a as the branch cannot bear
[1:35:42] fruit of itself except it abide in the
[1:35:45] vine no more can ye except ye abide in
[1:35:49] me I am the Vine you are the branches he
[1:35:52] that abideth in me see this is your
[1:35:55] daily life this is your this is what I
[1:35:58] was this is what everything I've been
[1:35:59] saying that it's it's you adjusting and
[1:36:02] arranging your life this this is an
[1:36:05] action word this isn't just you know
[1:36:08] something a nice thought oh I abide in
[1:36:10] Christ what does that even mean you you
[1:36:13] do you I I I abide in Christ and he
[1:36:15] abides in me well then why does your
[1:36:17] life look the way it looks it doesn't
[1:36:19] look like this yeah but a Believer and I
[1:36:22] follow it oh I'm not accusing you of not
[1:36:24] following him I'm I'm saying do you
[1:36:27] abide in him does your life show that
[1:36:32] you're not that you're more than just
[1:36:34] following right amen there were many the
[1:36:38] Bible says that followed him no
[1:36:43] longer remember that they they and and
[1:36:46] they they all abandoned him Jesus said
[1:36:48] to his disciples will you go also they
[1:36:50] said Lord where do we go you have the
[1:36:51] the words of eternal life amen so he
[1:36:54] comes into verse five I am the vine you
[1:36:56] are the branches he that abideth in me
[1:36:58] and I in him this is the one this is the
[1:37:02] same one that bringeth forth much fruit
[1:37:04] for without me abiding in you and you in
[1:37:08] me you can do nothing see if a man abide
[1:37:12] not in me he cast forth as a branch and
[1:37:14] is withered and Men gather them and cast
[1:37:17] them into the fire and they are burned
[1:37:20] if you AB in me and my words abide in
[1:37:23] you now catch it if you abide in me and
[1:37:27] my Rema amen abide in
[1:37:31] you not just the established word not
[1:37:35] just your mentally following this but
[1:37:39] but has your life become this then
[1:37:42] you're abiding in him he's abiding in
[1:37:46] you the word that if you abide in me if
[1:37:50] you abide in me
[1:37:51] and my words my Rema abide in you you're
[1:37:55] the one who will ask what you will and
[1:37:58] it shall be done to you you're the one
[1:38:01] herein who my father in who will my
[1:38:04] father will be glorified that you bear
[1:38:06] much fruit so shall you be my disciples
[1:38:11] amen you who have become the Living
[1:38:14] Word you who are in other words you who
[1:38:18] allow the word to live in you all the
[1:38:22] time amen amen abide in me see so so he
[1:38:30] so he's establishing them through the
[1:38:33] established word the
[1:38:35] logos uh that we read in verse three but
[1:38:39] but but if that's true give me verse
[1:38:40] three again
[1:38:42] Josh so now you're clean through the
[1:38:45] logos which I have spoken unto
[1:38:48] you so the question becomes com then why
[1:38:52] does not the nominal church member live
[1:38:56] clean if they have the
[1:38:59] logos if they and they do they read from
[1:39:03] the same book they've got them in their
[1:39:05] Library just like I do they've got them
[1:39:08] in their pews just like we do they have
[1:39:10] the logos just like you have the logos
[1:39:13] but verse seven is showing it's got to
[1:39:15] come from Ink to skin it's got to be a
[1:39:19] living thing it's got the Liv living
[1:39:21] Saints those who are alive with the Life
[1:39:25] of Christ him abiding in them them
[1:39:27] abiding in him that's the ones who will
[1:39:29] ask the father in my name that's the
[1:39:31] ones who will have the power and
[1:39:33] demonstration of the Holy
[1:39:35] Spirit see so Rema must be in play for
[1:39:40] the established word to live out of his
[1:39:43] disciples that's the point Jesus is
[1:39:45] trying to get them to understand you're
[1:39:46] not just going to follow me anymore boys
[1:39:48] you're going to need to go you're
[1:39:50] getting ready to heaven an experience
[1:39:51] that's going to take you deeper than
[1:39:53] just following me my Ministry Jesus is
[1:39:57] saying to them my Ministry is about to
[1:40:00] multiply now not like you think probably
[1:40:03] you're you're going to be surprised how
[1:40:05] it happens you're going to get
[1:40:06] discouraged and think Calvary is a is a
[1:40:09] devastating defeat but what you're going
[1:40:11] to find out later oh my is on that
[1:40:15] morning on Resurrection morning I will
[1:40:17] Ascend with all power in Heaven and
[1:40:19] Earth and I'll send you into Jerusalem
[1:40:22] and I'll come down among you and then
[1:40:24] you will be me in the Earth again in a
[1:40:28] many membered body
[1:40:30] Hallelujah that's what it means to be a
[1:40:33] message
[1:40:34] believer say what what was the early
[1:40:38] Church in Jerusalem Message
[1:40:40] Church oh of course of course it was the
[1:40:45] message isn't a new thing the message is
[1:40:47] a restoration of what already was we
[1:40:50] just call it the message it's the gospel
[1:40:52] is what it is but but but the the beauty
[1:40:56] of this version of it is that it's the
[1:40:59] full complete revitalizing the full
[1:41:02] complete repairing of the altar the full
[1:41:05] complete
[1:41:06] restoration the full complete Christ the
[1:41:10] the brother brandham said brother
[1:41:12] brandham said a full promise from a full
[1:41:15] God and that makes a full believer
[1:41:19] hallelujah oh my
[1:41:22] so we see then that that this that what
[1:41:25] Jesus is showing them that the word must
[1:41:29] go from logos to Rema and this actually
[1:41:31] is the
[1:41:33] non-negotiable I know trinitarian
[1:41:35] preachers like to preach that belief in
[1:41:38] the Trinity is the non-negotiable which
[1:41:41] is ridiculous right amen because you've
[1:41:43] just threw out all the apostles because
[1:41:45] they never believed the Trinity because
[1:41:47] it didn't even
[1:41:48] exist see and then and then even when
[1:41:50] they they finally started putting it
[1:41:52] together as brother JD has showed us in
[1:41:55] his Sunday School classes they didn't
[1:41:56] even have it all formed up it took
[1:41:58] hundreds of years and it was a work in
[1:42:01] progress so what my goodness U what the
[1:42:04] apostles didn't believe in the Trinity
[1:42:06] no one had even ever used that word they
[1:42:08] knew here o Israel the Lord your God is
[1:42:10] one they knew Jesus was God they they
[1:42:13] knew who he was they weren't they
[1:42:15] weren't they you say how do you know
[1:42:18] that they knew who he was because not
[1:42:21] what they said but what they did they
[1:42:24] heard him say baptize in the name of the
[1:42:28] father and the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:42:31] and when they applied that they baptized
[1:42:34] people in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:36] Christ
[1:42:38] hello it's not hard they understood
[1:42:42] clearly who he was see their actions
[1:42:46] proved that they had the
[1:42:49] Revelation see so oh my I'm I'm out of
[1:42:53] time stand up we're
[1:42:56] done God bless
[1:42:58] you amen praise the Lord amen oh I want
[1:43:02] to keep going trust me but I would need
