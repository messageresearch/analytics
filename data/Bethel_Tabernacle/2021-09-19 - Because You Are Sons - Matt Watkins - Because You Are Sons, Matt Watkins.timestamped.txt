[46:53] muted no sound on me here are good now
[46:55] okay praise the lord that was on the
[46:57] internet
[46:59] david describes here and we've spoken
[47:02] actually in the past something very
[47:04] close to this uh along these same exact
[47:07] lines
[47:08] but david is speaking of these sailors
[47:11] and just keep your bible open there
[47:14] to psalms 107 if you keep that up on the
[47:16] screen and we'll get to your powerpoint
[47:18] actually uh here in a moment brother
[47:20] josh if you could i apologize to go back
[47:22] but let's bring the scriptures up we'll
[47:24] get that powerpoint here in a moment
[47:26] he begins describing these sailors and
[47:29] look at it let's pick it up again here
[47:31] in verse 23 they that go down to the sea
[47:34] and ships that do business in great
[47:36] waters
[47:37] so he's speaking of skilled men these
[47:40] are not novices but these are sailors
[47:43] they do business in their boat they know
[47:45] their boat they they're they're
[47:47] acquainted with it they know how to
[47:49] react in a storm they know uh they know
[47:52] what measures have to be taken
[47:54] and david says that but yet the the
[47:57] stormy wind has a rose and now they're
[48:00] they're toiling and they're struggling
[48:03] and they are fighting the water and
[48:05] they're fighting the winds and they're
[48:07] they're doing everything they can to
[48:09] adjust the cells and they're throwing
[48:12] down the anchor and they're they're
[48:14] trying to you know look at their their
[48:16] what you know their gauges and try to
[48:18] understand you know what are we we're
[48:20] not we're in a we're in a crisis
[48:22] we're in a calamity where we're we're
[48:25] going to be capsized
[48:27] and and so no doubt they they go through
[48:30] all of the human measures that they can
[48:32] they
[48:33] maybe have been in a storm before and
[48:35] they've uh you know they they've they've
[48:38] been been saved from that or their
[48:40] experience but david is describing this
[48:42] situation that has came upon them and he
[48:46] says they don't know what to do
[48:48] they've tried everything that they can
[48:50] try
[48:51] and he says here look at it verse 24 uh
[48:54] verse 25
[48:55] for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy
[48:59] wind
[49:00] which lifteth lifteth up the waves
[49:03] thereof if you have that on the screen
[49:05] brother josh psalms 107 107. let's look
[49:08] at it together
[49:09] psalms 107 and let's just look at that
[49:11] again
[49:13] he says in verse 25 for he commandeth
[49:16] and raiseth the stormy wind now who is
[49:19] commanding and raising
[49:22] the wind
[49:23] that has caused these sailors to lose
[49:25] control
[49:27] he
[49:29] this hello are you here this morning
[49:32] he commandeth the stormy wind
[49:35] sometimes it's god who causes the stormy
[49:38] wind
[49:39] for us to lose control
[49:41] and the bible says they throw up their
[49:43] hands they're at their wit's end they
[49:45] stagger like drunk men that's what the
[49:48] scripture says here in verse 27 let's
[49:51] look at verse 26 they mount up to the
[49:53] heaven they go down into the depths
[49:55] their soul is melted because of trouble
[49:59] so what's he describing their boat is
[50:01] going up
[50:03] and then their boat goes down and then
[50:04] their boat goes back up
[50:06] and then their boat goes down and
[50:08] they're there they're trying everything
[50:10] they can to save it they're exhausting
[50:13] all their human ability their exhaust
[50:15] another human experience
[50:18] am i preaching to anybody this morning
[50:21] amen
[50:22] they've gotten to a place to where they
[50:24] can't control the circumstances
[50:27] and it's not the devil it's not what
[50:30] they've done it's not the any of any
[50:32] thought of their own but he
[50:36] has put them in this scenario
[50:39] the bible says
[50:40] he calls us
[50:42] verse 27 they will to and fro and
[50:44] stagger like drunken men are at their
[50:46] wits in then they cry unto the lord in
[50:50] their trouble and he bringeth them out
[50:53] of their distresses he maketh the storm
[50:56] a calm you know the lord is the only one
[50:59] who can calm the storm
[51:02] that he caused
[51:04] amen
[51:06] only the lord can calm the storm
[51:09] that he caused
[51:10] so if he's the one who commanded the
[51:12] stormy wind he's the one who has the
[51:15] command
[51:16] the calm
[51:18] notice david says here they they're at
[51:20] their wits in that term that phrase
[51:24] simply means to have lost or exhausted
[51:28] any possibility or perceiving or
[51:32] thinking of a way
[51:34] out of despair right amen
[51:37] in short it means the end of human
[51:40] ability the end of all human resources
[51:45] the end of all human
[51:48] intervention
[51:50] it's it's it's the end of all human help
[51:55] there's no escape there's no deliverance
[51:58] there's no figuring it out
[52:00] there's only one you say brother matt
[52:02] then what's the answer god
[52:05] and notice this here in jeremiah chapter
[52:08] 17 if you have that on the screen you
[52:09] can put it
[52:10] thus saith the lord this is jeremiah 17
[52:13] verse 5
[52:15] thus saith the lord cursed be the man
[52:18] that trusteth in man
[52:21] and maketh
[52:22] flesh his arm
[52:25] and whose heart departeth from the lord
[52:28] now listen very close to what jeremiah
[52:30] says here cursed so we already know the
[52:33] result
[52:34] we already know the outcome cursed
[52:38] cursed be the man
[52:40] that trusteth in man
[52:43] and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart
[52:46] departed from the lord for he shall be
[52:49] like the heath in the desert like
[52:52] tumbleweed that's what he's saying and
[52:54] shall not see when good cometh
[52:57] but shall inhabit the parched places in
[53:00] the wilderness
[53:01] in a salt land
[53:03] and not inhabited now let's let's let's
[53:06] go from cursed to blessed
[53:09] blessed is the man that trusteth
[53:12] in the lord
[53:15] and whose hope is in the lord
[53:18] for he shall be as the tree planted by
[53:20] the waters
[53:22] and that spreadeth out her roots by the
[53:24] river and shall not see when he cometh
[53:28] but her leaf shall be green
[53:31] and shall not be careful in the year
[53:34] that means worried or concerned or
[53:37] stressed
[53:39] and shall not be careful in the year of
[53:42] drought neither shall cease
[53:45] from yielding
[53:46] fruit
[53:48] so jeremiah describes two different
[53:50] types of people or he maybe is
[53:52] describing one person but sometimes we
[53:55] have one reaction and then other times
[53:57] we have another reaction that's really
[53:59] if we'd be honest sometimes we don't
[54:01] sometimes we do good and we react the
[54:03] right way and we look at a situation the
[54:05] right way and other times we fail
[54:07] miserably
[54:09] and we have nothing to do but to look at
[54:11] ourselves and say lord just forgive me
[54:12] that's all i can ask is for forgiveness
[54:15] but he's describing two people
[54:17] and and he says here the first person he
[54:20] talks about jeremiah says is that man
[54:22] cursed be that man
[54:24] this is a man who doesn't wait for the
[54:26] lord
[54:27] he just moves ahead of the lord
[54:29] he has trouble he has he has
[54:32] a problem and so he's going to problem
[54:34] solve it because that's what a man does
[54:36] he problem-solves
[54:40] and he figures it out
[54:42] right brothers
[54:45] he figures it out he puts his hand to
[54:47] work he's gonna he's got this he's gonna
[54:50] he's gonna make it work no matter what
[54:52] he's got to do he'll make it work at the
[54:54] end of the day
[54:55] it's gonna work out
[54:57] jeremiah is describing a man who doesn't
[54:59] wait for the lord to move but he takes
[55:02] matters into his own hands
[55:04] makes his own plans
[55:06] turns uh
[55:08] uh uh
[55:09] taking no matter what he's got to do he
[55:11] schemes he plans he manipulates
[55:17] no matter what he's he's going to solve
[55:20] the problem
[55:22] do you know what
[55:24] jeremiah says that man's life will be
[55:26] like
[55:28] the bible says
[55:29] he'll be spiritually
[55:31] in the desert
[55:33] that's what he says
[55:34] he lived in parched places
[55:37] his life will be notice what he says
[55:39] here cursing to be the man he shall be
[55:41] like the heath in the desert it's like
[55:42] tumbleweed it's just dried up it's
[55:45] rotted it has no life
[55:47] he says he'll be like that he should be
[55:49] like the heath the shrub
[55:51] he looks he's alive he's there he's
[55:55] breathing
[55:56] he's he's got life he's he's present but
[56:00] inwardly he's dry and he's empty
[56:02] amen
[56:04] he'll have no fruit
[56:07] no water which is the wellspring of life
[56:09] there will be no
[56:11] no uh
[56:12] a wellspring of life to his life he
[56:16] shall seed look at this
[56:18] he shall not seedy have your bible there
[56:20] if you do if you don't then please put
[56:22] it on the screen for me
[56:24] as i'm reading this
[56:26] he shall not see when good
[56:28] cometh so he never sees good he never
[56:32] has joy
[56:34] uh everything he looks at turns into
[56:36] misery he's isolated it means he's
[56:39] living in that parched place that
[56:41] isolated place
[56:44] now i want you to look you say brother
[56:45] matt who is he describing the man who
[56:47] trusts in man
[56:51] the man who trusts in man that may be
[56:54] another that made it made be a a job a
[56:57] career an income
[57:00] it may be yourself your ability your
[57:02] intellect no matter what it is he's
[57:04] trusting in himself he'll make it
[57:07] he won't die
[57:09] he'll keep going but he'll be dry he'll
[57:11] be barren he'll be fruitless
[57:14] now listen to what what david said what
[57:17] jeremiah says though his life is is is
[57:20] he won't see when good cometh but notice
[57:23] what he says to the man who trust in god
[57:26] in hard places
[57:30] a man who trusts in god
[57:32] in a tight spot in a hard place when he
[57:35] can't when he doesn't see it clearly
[57:37] when he's in distress or turmoil
[57:40] or in calamity or in crisis
[57:43] notice what dave notice what jeremiah
[57:45] says
[57:46] blessed is the man verse 7 blessed is
[57:49] the man that trusteth in the lord
[57:53] and whose hope
[57:55] is in the lord
[57:58] jeremiah says this man is planted
[58:02] amen he's rooted
[58:06] does he does he get tossed to and fro
[58:08] just like the man who trusts in the arm
[58:11] of flesh the same exact way
[58:14] he's he's he's in the storm the same
[58:17] exact way he goes through the
[58:19] uncertainty the same exact way he
[58:21] doesn't have the answers
[58:23] the man who's trusting the lord doesn't
[58:25] have the answers no more than man
[58:26] trusted in the flesh
[58:29] the man who's trusted in the lord goes
[58:31] through the same trouble as the man
[58:32] who's trusted in flesh he feels the same
[58:34] pain he suffers the same
[58:37] the difference is his trust is in the
[58:39] lord
[58:41] and jeremiah says
[58:42] he shall be
[58:44] like
[58:46] blessed is the man
[58:47] that trusteth in the lord who's over the
[58:49] lord for he shall be as a tree planted
[58:52] by the waters
[58:54] and that spreadeth out her roots
[58:57] by the river
[58:58] he has stability
[59:01] he has roots
[59:02] he has a foundation don't you love this
[59:07] he has a reservoir of living water that
[59:10] he can draw from
[59:11] he's spreading out he's fruitful he's
[59:14] green
[59:15] and he shall not be careful that means
[59:18] to be fearful that means to be in
[59:20] anxiety or stress
[59:22] in the year of drought when things get
[59:24] uh get when things don't make sense
[59:27] when things
[59:28] aren't adding up yet there will be an
[59:31] inward peace and an inward security that
[59:34] he has
[59:36] i want to be the man who trusts in the
[59:37] lord
[59:39] in spite of anything that's happening in
[59:41] my life
[59:42] he trusts in the lord he's and and and
[59:45] david begins to david begins to describe
[59:48] this this storm i want you to notice and
[59:51] we're going to pick up some of what we
[59:52] spoke on wednesday
[59:54] he begins to describe this storm that
[59:57] god has caused and god has caused the
[1:00:01] stormy wind and god has raised the waves
[1:00:05] god is the one who has brought this
[1:00:07] storm
[1:00:08] upon this man
[1:00:10] and david says they cry out they toil
[1:00:14] they beg they they try everything in
[1:00:16] their human resources till finally they
[1:00:19] get to the point to where they throw up
[1:00:21] their hands
[1:00:24] and they're not quitting
[1:00:26] notice there's a difference in throwing
[1:00:27] up your hands and surrender
[1:00:30] and throwing out your hands and giving
[1:00:32] up
[1:00:33] we preached on wednesday of never never
[1:00:35] never surrender
[1:00:36] there's a difference when you give up
[1:00:39] and you give in
[1:00:41] and when you raise your hands and you're
[1:00:42] at your wit's in and you cry out unto
[1:00:45] the lord
[1:00:47] david says
[1:00:48] then notice this in psalm 73
[1:00:51] he says there are in psalms 107 sorry he
[1:00:54] says then they cry verse 28 then they
[1:00:57] cry unto the lord in their trouble
[1:01:01] and he bringeth them out of their
[1:01:04] distresses
[1:01:06] he maketh the storm a calm so that the
[1:01:10] waves thereof
[1:01:12] are still verse 30 then are they glad i
[1:01:16] love this
[1:01:17] then are they glad because they be quiet
[1:01:20] so he bringeth them unto their desired
[1:01:24] haven let me just stop here and say the
[1:01:26] lord is going to get you to your desired
[1:01:28] haven
[1:01:29] he's going to get us to the desired
[1:01:31] haven it may go through storms and we
[1:01:34] may go through a lot of uncertain times
[1:01:36] but just know this he's going to get us
[1:01:38] to the desired haven
[1:01:40] i'm thankful for that
[1:01:42] we spoke on
[1:01:44] wednesday about
[1:01:46] this man and this i heard this
[1:01:49] minister speaking about statistics of
[1:01:51] drowning and how many people drown in
[1:01:54] shallow water
[1:01:55] and and and he gave the statistic of
[1:01:58] accidents that happen
[1:02:00] uh to people fatal accidents
[1:02:03] statistically there's a it's a forget
[1:02:05] what the number was the percentage was
[1:02:08] but they the the the
[1:02:10] accidents that happened within three or
[1:02:12] four miles away
[1:02:14] from being home isn't that incredible to
[1:02:16] think about
[1:02:18] isn't that incredible speaking to
[1:02:20] brother travis who's uh just under the
[1:02:23] weather this morning was speaking
[1:02:24] yesterday about this
[1:02:26] and he was telling me even as one of his
[1:02:28] best friends who's a surfer and has
[1:02:30] surfed all over the world and in
[1:02:32] different places and he says what's
[1:02:34] incredible about what you're saying is
[1:02:36] the greatest most horrible tragic
[1:02:38] accidents he said this this guy has
[1:02:41] served you know i don't want to give a
[1:02:43] number let's talk the surfers say no
[1:02:45] that was he didn't serve a wave that big
[1:02:46] it was big waves he surfed really really
[1:02:49] big big waves and really deep oceans
[1:02:53] and he said none of the accidents none
[1:02:55] of the none of the injuries that he's
[1:02:57] ever had has happened in the deep water
[1:03:00] it's never happened under the deep big
[1:03:02] big depths but all of the accidents have
[1:03:05] taken place in shallow water
[1:03:09] and just a few feet of water and and not
[1:03:11] even under not even on the big giant
[1:03:14] waves but on the little surfable waves
[1:03:17] where there shouldn't be an accident yet
[1:03:19] the most you're the most prone let me
[1:03:22] just say this you're the most prone
[1:03:25] to accidents when you are closest to
[1:03:28] shore
[1:03:31] in other words you're the vulnerable
[1:03:32] you're at your most vulnerable and satan
[1:03:35] knows this you're at your most
[1:03:37] vulnerable point
[1:03:39] when the storm is just about to let up
[1:03:44] hello somebody
[1:03:46] when you're just about to come out of
[1:03:49] the trial when you're just about to make
[1:03:52] it when you you've already survived the
[1:03:54] worst of it you've already made it
[1:03:56] through the worst you've already made it
[1:03:58] through the deep isn't it a tragedy that
[1:04:01] something that
[1:04:02] you can survive
[1:04:04] something you shouldn't have survived
[1:04:06] yet you made it through but now
[1:04:08] something that you should be able to
[1:04:10] survive and is survivable and you end up
[1:04:12] drowning in shallow water
[1:04:17] when you could make it
[1:04:19] you're at your most vulnerable
[1:04:22] because trials are sort of like that you
[1:04:25] know they they come and as we said on
[1:04:28] wednesday
[1:04:29] they come in in various forms some are
[1:04:32] uh maybe a crisis that happens to
[1:04:34] somebody and then man suddenly you're
[1:04:36] just in it just like that
[1:04:38] and then some others are steady or over
[1:04:42] time something that's wearing on you and
[1:04:44] it just wears you down and wears you
[1:04:47] down and wears you down
[1:04:49] but you know sometimes we we
[1:04:52] we get it in our mind and i'm just going
[1:04:53] to say this here this morning as job
[1:04:56] struggled to find the lord we spoke last
[1:04:59] about jeremiah struggling to find
[1:05:01] where's the lord in in all of this and
[1:05:03] even got to a place to where he's asking
[1:05:05] god to take his own life elijah got to
[1:05:07] the pla same exact place asking god to
[1:05:10] take his life your brother branham got
[1:05:11] to the same exact spot just wants to
[1:05:13] give up give in put a gun to his head
[1:05:17] after he had survived so much after he
[1:05:19] went through so much
[1:05:22] and and and and he speaks about this and
[1:05:25] i wanted to just go just a little bit
[1:05:27] further on that
[1:05:28] even the apostle paul i want you to turn
[1:05:31] to second corinthians chapter one we're
[1:05:33] just going to look at this take just a
[1:05:35] minute here for second corinthians
[1:05:37] chapter one if you have your bible if
[1:05:38] you would turn also
[1:05:42] they'll put it on the screen if you
[1:05:43] don't second corinthians chapter one
[1:05:46] i want you to look at the apostle paul
[1:05:49] here
[1:05:50] who the bible says
[1:05:52] he had he had given his entire life and
[1:05:54] spent from his conversion
[1:05:57] he's dedicated he's consecrated every
[1:06:00] breath in his body
[1:06:02] all of his uh uh all of everything that
[1:06:05] he did was
[1:06:06] was for the purpose of the gospel being
[1:06:10] spread
[1:06:11] for the purpose of the kingdom of god we
[1:06:14] could say that he'd given up the whole
[1:06:16] world and he said it this way that he
[1:06:19] might win christ
[1:06:22] think about those words here just for a
[1:06:24] moment i may get just get a little bit
[1:06:26] practical and that's okay that i might
[1:06:28] win christ
[1:06:30] what does that mean
[1:06:32] that i might
[1:06:34] win christ this is what paul says
[1:06:37] i've given up everything i've counted
[1:06:39] everything i've learned
[1:06:41] everything previous
[1:06:43] as dung
[1:06:45] what paul equated everything that he
[1:06:47] knew
[1:06:48] i'm just giving you his own words yeah
[1:06:51] i counted as dung
[1:06:53] that i may win christ
[1:06:56] so in other words it meant everything
[1:06:58] to him he was dedicated he was sold out
[1:07:02] he was committed to the calls
[1:07:05] i want to be committed to the calls
[1:07:08] i read paul's words and i say lord i
[1:07:10] want to be that that consecrated to
[1:07:12] where i could say i count everything as
[1:07:15] lost that i might win christ
[1:07:17] that i can be that sold out
[1:07:20] the where he gives every part of his
[1:07:22] being
[1:07:23] every breath to the master
[1:07:26] this is a man who had great revelation
[1:07:28] in so much he says that there was a
[1:07:30] thorn given me just to keep me humble
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:35] then he said i knew a man of a man
[1:07:37] called to the third heaven and paul
[1:07:39] speaking of himself and he heard things
[1:07:41] that aren't even lawful to be uttered
[1:07:43] and he says therefore
[1:07:45] because of the abundance this is his
[1:07:48] words of revelation amen
[1:07:50] because of the abundance of revelation
[1:07:52] so that i wouldn't become exalted
[1:07:55] the lord gave me a splinter of thorn a
[1:07:59] prick
[1:08:00] in my flesh to keep me humble
[1:08:04] we don't realize
[1:08:06] sometimes the things god puts in our
[1:08:10] life and he doesn't tell us
[1:08:12] but the difficulties and calamities and
[1:08:15] things that he brings that we're praying
[1:08:17] and praying and praying god why does
[1:08:18] this happen to me and we don't realize
[1:08:20] the lord puts that in her life to keep
[1:08:23] us grounded and humble and and in our
[1:08:26] proper place
[1:08:29] that's why we say no matter what the
[1:08:31] lord does he's a good good father
[1:08:33] and whatever he does in our life whether
[1:08:36] we know it or figure it out he knows
[1:08:38] best can you say amen
[1:08:40] paul says he he prayed three times over
[1:08:43] this and lord said my grace is
[1:08:45] sufficient for you
[1:08:47] in other words it's enough it's enough
[1:08:49] paul
[1:08:49] it's enough for you to have my grace but
[1:08:51] i want the answer it's enough to have my
[1:08:53] grace
[1:08:55] the man had revelation uh he had seen
[1:08:59] the lord
[1:09:00] you know he's not not one of the
[1:09:01] disciples but he's seen the light that
[1:09:03] appeared and said saul saul why
[1:09:04] persecute us i mean who are thou
[1:09:07] who was speaking to paul this was the
[1:09:09] lord jesus
[1:09:12] and this was a man who had the spirit of
[1:09:15] of god had had so descended upon paul he
[1:09:18] was given the very mystery of the gospel
[1:09:23] and the bible says that he would paul
[1:09:25] would go to asia and and notice when
[1:09:28] he's now i want you just to pick this up
[1:09:30] in second corinthians chapter 1 verse
[1:09:33] this was a man who had great
[1:09:36] authority we could say great contact
[1:09:40] a great relationship with the lord
[1:09:44] one-on-one
[1:09:46] and yet now read what we find here in
[1:09:48] second corinthians chapter one verse
[1:09:50] eight this is when paul goes to asia
[1:09:52] asia to preach the gospel
[1:09:54] for we would not brethren have you
[1:09:56] ignorant of our trouble
[1:09:59] of our trouble
[1:10:00] which came to us
[1:10:02] in asia
[1:10:03] do you do are you familiar with that
[1:10:05] word trouble amen
[1:10:07] anybody know what that word is
[1:10:10] anybody that can say i've i've i could i
[1:10:12] could give you my life story and i could
[1:10:15] tell you about trouble
[1:10:17] i could tell you a lot about trouble
[1:10:19] but are you a son of god are you a
[1:10:21] daughter of god
[1:10:23] listen this is what paul says for i
[1:10:25] would not have you ignore in other words
[1:10:27] i'm not going to i'm not going to hide
[1:10:29] this i'm not gonna just gonna shun i'm
[1:10:30] not just gonna give you all the
[1:10:31] highlights
[1:10:33] i'm not gonna give you all the greatest
[1:10:35] things and all the you know paul could
[1:10:37] have just left all this out he could
[1:10:38] have never told us about any of this and
[1:10:41] could have just told us about this life
[1:10:43] full of ease
[1:10:45] and life full of comfort and full of the
[1:10:48] glories and full of the revelations and
[1:10:52] the abundance of mercies and all of the
[1:10:54] good things that happened to him i'm so
[1:10:56] glad that he didn't do that
[1:10:59] because i would feel so disconnected
[1:11:01] but when he says brethren i don't want
[1:11:03] you to be ignorant of all the trouble i
[1:11:05] had
[1:11:07] listen
[1:11:08] for we would not brethren have you
[1:11:10] ignorant of our trouble which came to us
[1:11:11] in asia that we were pressed notice this
[1:11:15] the trouble that we were came so god had
[1:11:18] been using paul in a in a a a powerful
[1:11:22] way in ephesus all the way through all
[1:11:25] of asia and the great revival has has
[1:11:28] fallen and two years later the revival
[1:11:31] fires are burning him and and the bible
[1:11:33] says in acts 19 the word of god grew
[1:11:36] mightily
[1:11:37] and god the power of god the word of god
[1:11:39] prevailed no doubt demon spirits were
[1:11:42] cast out and miracles were taking place
[1:11:44] and all of the wonderful uh the the lame
[1:11:48] and the sick were being healed the blind
[1:11:50] eyes were being opened the deaf ears
[1:11:51] were hearing
[1:11:53] and paul his ministry was at the very
[1:11:56] center of everything that was happening
[1:11:58] the revival that was happening anointing
[1:12:01] handkerchiefs and aprons and he lays
[1:12:04] them upon the people and here comes
[1:12:05] healing and here comes deliverance and
[1:12:08] verse 11 of acts 19
[1:12:10] and god wrote special miracles notice
[1:12:13] this actually acts 19
[1:12:15] uh verse 11
[1:12:18] and god wrote special miracles
[1:12:21] by the hands of paul
[1:12:24] so that from his body
[1:12:27] were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs
[1:12:30] or aprons and the diseases this is verse
[1:12:33] 11 and verse 12
[1:12:35] and the diseases departed from them
[1:12:38] and the evil spirits
[1:12:40] went out from them amen
[1:12:43] there's such miraculous that
[1:12:46] ephesus falls under
[1:12:48] repentance and repents and a revival
[1:12:52] breaks out
[1:12:53] and and and here's here's a massive
[1:12:56] here's a massive outpouring of the
[1:12:58] spirit of god
[1:12:59] and satan is thwarted and satan is
[1:13:02] defeated and there's rejoicing and
[1:13:05] and all of these all of these what you
[1:13:07] could call miracles like mount carmel
[1:13:10] for elijah taking place
[1:13:12] he had he had he was living at the
[1:13:15] center of this revival fire
[1:13:18] seeing god move
[1:13:20] but now look at second corinthians
[1:13:22] chapter one turn back there if you could
[1:13:24] and verse seven
[1:13:26] uh verse eight second corinthians one
[1:13:28] verse eight for we would not brethren
[1:13:31] have you ignorant of our trouble
[1:13:33] which came
[1:13:35] to us
[1:13:37] in asia
[1:13:38] notice this
[1:13:40] second could this is if you could get
[1:13:42] there quickly second corinthians
[1:13:45] chapter 1.
[1:13:47] he says we were pressed
[1:13:50] out of measure this is verse 8.
[1:13:52] we were pressed out of measure
[1:13:56] what does that mean
[1:13:58] we were above our own human ability we
[1:14:00] were pressed out
[1:14:02] above measure above strength in so much
[1:14:06] that we despaired
[1:14:08] even
[1:14:09] of life
[1:14:11] paul
[1:14:12] your ministry
[1:14:13] what's happened your the miraculous the
[1:14:16] healings the power of god and he's going
[1:14:19] to spread the gospel and now what does
[1:14:21] he find trouble
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:24] trouble
[1:14:25] trials tribulation we were pressed out
[1:14:29] above strength in so much that we
[1:14:31] despaired even of life
[1:14:35] he got to a place where he thought it's
[1:14:36] over it's going to end this is it
[1:14:38] this is what he's meaning here we
[1:14:40] despaired even in life this is this is
[1:14:42] how it's all going to end after all of
[1:14:44] the work and after all of the labor and
[1:14:47] after all of the toil and after i've
[1:14:49] surrendered all of my breath and all of
[1:14:51] my energy and all of my body to the lord
[1:14:54] this is what i get in repayment
[1:14:58] this is isn't this how what the devil
[1:15:00] told brother branham
[1:15:01] when he says look at you and look at
[1:15:03] your ministry and his baby's in the
[1:15:05] hospital dying his wife has already died
[1:15:07] and he says look at you and he gets him
[1:15:10] to start considering his own life
[1:15:12] and he says you've given everything yeah
[1:15:15] that's true you've given your whole life
[1:15:16] to the gospel that's true you've stood
[1:15:19] there no one likes you
[1:15:21] all of your friends have forsaken you
[1:15:23] they all think you're crazy
[1:15:27] this is where the avenue the devil
[1:15:29] begins to use with reasoning
[1:15:31] all of your friends think you're crazy
[1:15:33] all the pulpits have been closed down to
[1:15:35] you and you've watched god heal the sick
[1:15:38] in your own meetings and when it comes
[1:15:40] to your own baby and brother branham
[1:15:42] says all of those things that he said
[1:15:44] were true
[1:15:47] i thought he was the son of god i
[1:15:49] thought he was a prophet of god
[1:15:52] i thought that the tru i thought that
[1:15:54] the righteous
[1:15:55] don't have trouble they don't have
[1:15:57] storms you know we bought into this idea
[1:16:00] somehow that because of trouble or
[1:16:02] because of turmoil it must mean god is
[1:16:05] absent as we said last wednesday don't
[1:16:07] ever don't ever believe that the
[1:16:09] presence of the storm or the trouble or
[1:16:12] the trial equals the absence of god it's
[1:16:16] quite the contrary
[1:16:19] because of the presence of the storm you
[1:16:21] may not see him physically you may not
[1:16:24] feel him emotionally you may not hear
[1:16:27] his voice in your spirit but here's his
[1:16:29] promise i'm there
[1:16:33] here's his promise whether you feel me
[1:16:35] or see me i'm right there
[1:16:37] in the middle of it
[1:16:40] what does he tell isaiah i think it is
[1:16:43] behold i'll go with you through the fire
[1:16:46] and and he says and the flood waters
[1:16:48] won't drown you for i'll be with you
[1:16:52] doesn't say that you'll see me doesn't
[1:16:54] say that you'll hear me doesn't say that
[1:16:56] you'll spit that i'll speak to you just
[1:16:58] know this i'm there
[1:17:02] paul says the sentence of death uh
[1:17:04] oppressed above we even despaired even
[1:17:06] of life
[1:17:08] uh even of life he's he's he says here
[1:17:11] let's look at it again we were pressed
[1:17:13] out of measure
[1:17:14] verse 8 above strength in so much
[1:17:19] that we despaired
[1:17:21] even of life
[1:17:26] thought it was all over
[1:17:28] overwhelmed would be a good word you
[1:17:31] could use and we're going to get to here
[1:17:33] here in just a moment
[1:17:35] he was brought so
[1:17:37] low
[1:17:38] that the apostle paul says his strength
[1:17:40] was gone
[1:17:42] we had the sentence of death
[1:17:44] verse nine
[1:17:45] we had the sentence of but we had the
[1:17:47] sentence of death
[1:17:49] in ourselves we had the sentence look
[1:17:52] here
[1:17:52] in other words i couldn't say i couldn't
[1:17:55] i i had no like these sailors i had no
[1:17:59] human remedy i had no
[1:18:02] human hope i had the sentence of death i
[1:18:05] couldn't see there was no way humanly
[1:18:07] possible
[1:18:08] how how could something like this happen
[1:18:11] to a man like paul the apostle paul
[1:18:15] notice this even even paul begins to
[1:18:18] describe this and he says for out of
[1:18:20] much affliction
[1:18:22] and anguish of heart i wrote to you with
[1:18:24] many tears not that you should be
[1:18:27] grieving you might know the love which i
[1:18:28] am more abundantly unto you so he says
[1:18:31] here in verse 5 for when we were coming
[1:18:34] to macedonia
[1:18:36] our flesh had no rest
[1:18:39] but we were troubled on every side
[1:18:42] without were fightings
[1:18:45] within
[1:18:47] were fears this is chapter seven sorry
[1:18:49] brother josh chapter seven verse five
[1:18:52] four he says for when we were coming to
[1:18:54] macedonia
[1:18:56] where our flesh had no rest we were
[1:18:59] troubled on every side without where
[1:19:01] fightings within were fears
[1:19:04] paul
[1:19:06] you had fear come on yeah
[1:19:09] paul you had trouble uh-huh
[1:19:13] without there was all trouble on every
[1:19:15] side within was fear
[1:19:18] within within within my mind was voices
[1:19:23] of doubt of despair
[1:19:26] within my heart
[1:19:27] within my body within my in my emotional
[1:19:30] realm
[1:19:31] the devil was attacking on every side
[1:19:34] but you speak to the lord paul yeah you
[1:19:36] have a relationship with the lord paul i
[1:19:38] did but yet trouble was all around
[1:19:42] on every side
[1:19:43] you see this is exactly how satan
[1:19:45] designs it satan's design is that he
[1:19:48] plants fear inside of us by looking at
[1:19:51] circumstances he'll speak to our mind
[1:19:53] he'll whisper in our ear he'll he'll
[1:19:56] he'll distract us in any way that he
[1:19:58] possibly can and to wear our confidence
[1:20:01] we lose our confidence in god we lose
[1:20:03] our confidence in faith we lose our
[1:20:05] confidence in people
[1:20:07] and
[1:20:08] and paul says without were fightings
[1:20:11] within we were troubled on every side
[1:20:13] and within were fears
[1:20:15] i want you to look at verse chapter one
[1:20:18] brother josh go back to chapter one
[1:20:20] and let's look at verse nine again
[1:20:23] notice what he says here he says but we
[1:20:25] have the sentence of death in ourselves
[1:20:28] here's why
[1:20:30] that we
[1:20:31] should not
[1:20:32] trust in ourselves but in god
[1:20:37] who raiseth the dead
[1:20:42] do you see where paul's faith was in
[1:20:45] god removed faith in so much that he
[1:20:48] moved his faith completely out of
[1:20:50] himself
[1:20:51] and not just to have faith in god for
[1:20:53] deliverance but even that if he died he
[1:20:56] could raise the dead
[1:21:00] it was faith paul says
[1:21:03] that the that that the that we should
[1:21:05] not trust in ourselves but in god
[1:21:08] which raiseth
[1:21:10] the dead
[1:21:12] you know asa gets to a place and the
[1:21:14] asaf this is a uh
[1:21:16] uh psalm that you know very well i just
[1:21:18] want to look at it in psalms chapter 73
[1:21:21] we're just gonna go just a little bit
[1:21:22] further psalms chapter 73 turn there in
[1:21:25] your bibles and also on the screen if
[1:21:27] you have it brother josh
[1:21:31] asaph was a a chief singer a levite
[1:21:35] this was a a leader of
[1:21:38] king david's worshipers his because his
[1:21:41] choir
[1:21:42] you know i don't i don't know all the
[1:21:44] details to that or or the you know the
[1:21:46] ins and out of that i can just tell you
[1:21:48] what the psalms records not every psalm
[1:21:51] we know that not every psalm was written
[1:21:53] by david but this is asaph
[1:21:56] and and he's he's a chief singer the
[1:21:58] bible calls him
[1:22:00] and he's a levite and he's he's he's
[1:22:03] he's a praiser he's a worshiper uh he
[1:22:06] was a man who was a close friend you
[1:22:09] could say that a close
[1:22:11] friend to david and so much that he
[1:22:13] david would put him in this kind of
[1:22:14] position
[1:22:16] no one could even be a levite serving in
[1:22:18] god's house
[1:22:19] you couldn't be in this position without
[1:22:21] having a relationship
[1:22:23] with david and and so david loved god
[1:22:26] and he loved worship and he loved being
[1:22:28] in god's house he tells us that one
[1:22:30] thing about his art i'd love to be in
[1:22:32] the lord's in the temple of god all the
[1:22:34] days of my life so this this man asaph
[1:22:37] was playing an important role any and
[1:22:39] he's cold he's he's a uh a a a a man
[1:22:43] with a ministry a man who's you could
[1:22:46] say is in close contact with the lord
[1:22:49] but notice what david what asaph
[1:22:51] confessed in psalm 73
[1:22:54] and verse 2
[1:22:56] but as for me
[1:22:58] let's just look at verse 1. we'll back
[1:23:00] up and read verse 1.
[1:23:02] truly god is good to israel even to such
[1:23:05] as are of a clean heart verse two
[1:23:08] but as for me this is asaph my feet were
[1:23:12] almost gone
[1:23:15] my steps
[1:23:16] had well nigh
[1:23:19] or nearly
[1:23:20] slipped
[1:23:22] now this was a man being honest
[1:23:24] he's called he's a chosen vessel of the
[1:23:27] lord a worshiper of god
[1:23:29] writing psalms
[1:23:30] and he says but as for me
[1:23:33] he says my feet were almost gone
[1:23:36] my steps
[1:23:37] had well nigh
[1:23:40] slipped now asap was a good man not a
[1:23:43] sinner not a backslider this was a a
[1:23:46] pure heart pure mind
[1:23:48] and he's asap he says this he's
[1:23:51] he's he's he's saying truly god is good
[1:23:54] to israel this is how he starts the
[1:23:56] psalm even as such as our of a clean
[1:24:00] heart
[1:24:01] in other words god has been good to me
[1:24:04] i have a clean heart before the lord and
[1:24:06] god has been good to me
[1:24:08] yet the very next verse he says but i
[1:24:11] there's a confession here's an admitting
[1:24:14] i almost fell
[1:24:16] i almost
[1:24:18] slipped now i don't know
[1:24:20] don't know and i can't find anywhere in
[1:24:22] the bible where it records why
[1:24:24] asaph never really says you know asaph
[1:24:27] being that close to david watches
[1:24:29] david fall
[1:24:31] watches david get entangled in adultery
[1:24:34] and then murder him
[1:24:36] has a has that woman's husband uriah
[1:24:39] murdered maybe
[1:24:41] i don't know maybe you're that close to
[1:24:44] to david to king david and you have that
[1:24:47] much confidence in him and you watch a
[1:24:49] man who has been so high and mighty in
[1:24:52] your mind and you watch him fall to such
[1:24:54] a low
[1:24:56] fall fallen adultery that would shake my
[1:24:59] confidence and shake your confidence
[1:25:02] you put trust in people i don't know i'm
[1:25:05] just i don't know if that's what he's
[1:25:06] speaking of when he says i almost fell
[1:25:08] my feet almost slipped in other words he
[1:25:11] almost turned back and and asap says my
[1:25:13] feet almost slipped
[1:25:15] i almost fell and and maybe it was maybe
[1:25:19] it was because of that maybe it was
[1:25:21] because of what he's seen and what he
[1:25:24] watched
[1:25:26] and he could just look at it and say you
[1:25:28] know
[1:25:29] this just isn't for me you know i can't
[1:25:31] i can't believe you know
[1:25:33] the the this is this is more than what i
[1:25:36] could bear
[1:25:39] regardless of what it was i don't know
[1:25:42] but regardless of what it was in aces
[1:25:45] asap's heart
[1:25:47] as he says that i almost fell
[1:25:50] i almost
[1:25:52] slipped
[1:25:54] and you know what you know what asaph
[1:25:56] began to do
[1:25:57] and we know this from verse i want you
[1:25:59] just to look here
[1:26:00] and we're just going to go a little bit
[1:26:01] further than this
[1:26:03] he says this is this is this is the
[1:26:05] psalm
[1:26:06] of asap keep going past that uh let's go
[1:26:09] to verse 14. that'd be good
[1:26:12] notice this what he says for all day all
[1:26:14] the day long i have been plagued and
[1:26:16] chastened every morning now he begins to
[1:26:19] turn just like jeremiah just like job
[1:26:23] just like elijah and they start to turn
[1:26:26] the tables
[1:26:28] and that trial and that misunderstanding
[1:26:30] then goes to blame
[1:26:32] and blaming and calling and and blaming
[1:26:36] and giving or or or
[1:26:39] uh uh blaming god for neglect
[1:26:42] amen
[1:26:44] blaming god for injustice
[1:26:47] he says for all the dealing i've been
[1:26:49] trust this this word plague the hebrew
[1:26:51] word plagued means chastened
[1:26:53] in other words he's saying i wake up and
[1:26:55] i have pain i'm touched by sorrow
[1:26:58] and i feel like i'm being punished and
[1:27:00] he says in verse 15 just let's just keep
[1:27:02] going through this if i say i will speak
[1:27:05] thus behold i should offend against the
[1:27:07] generation of thy children keep going to
[1:27:09] verse 16. when i thought to know this it
[1:27:12] was too
[1:27:13] painful
[1:27:15] for me
[1:27:16] he says for i was this is this is what
[1:27:18] he starts to look at
[1:27:20] he says in verse three for i was envious
[1:27:25] when i saw the poverty the for i was
[1:27:27] envious of the foolish when i saw the
[1:27:29] prosperity
[1:27:31] of the wicked
[1:27:34] now hold on a minute asap where are you
[1:27:36] going with this
[1:27:37] in other words how does someone
[1:27:40] who doesn't love god
[1:27:42] who doesn't have anything to do with god
[1:27:45] who mocks god
[1:27:47] who mocks me
[1:27:49] and that man's blessed and he has he's
[1:27:52] foolish
[1:27:54] and he's blessed he's proud he has
[1:27:56] prosperity
[1:27:57] he
[1:27:58] prospers how does the hell is when i saw
[1:28:01] the prosperity of the wicked and now he
[1:28:05] looks and contrasts his own life
[1:28:08] and poverty and says yet i give
[1:28:10] everything to god i'm a worshiper of the
[1:28:12] lord i i've dedicated my whole life i've
[1:28:15] given all my i've given my body i've
[1:28:17] given my breath and yet
[1:28:19] here i am in poverty and struggle and
[1:28:21] anguishing
[1:28:23] trouble yet the wicked and this asap
[1:28:26] says this is this trips me up
[1:28:29] it causes me to stumble when i try to
[1:28:32] rationalize
[1:28:34] how does it how does it work out this
[1:28:36] way
[1:28:37] how is this fair
[1:28:40] is that a fair question to ask
[1:28:45] how is this fair
[1:28:47] how how how does god look at all the
[1:28:50] foolish look at all the sinners they
[1:28:51] don't pray they don't read their bible
[1:28:53] they don't go to church
[1:28:55] they neglect the lord and neglect his
[1:28:57] word it means nothing to them
[1:28:59] and yet they're not plagued as i'm
[1:29:01] plagued they're not in trouble as he
[1:29:03] says in psalm 73 verse 5. look at verse
[1:29:06] 5.
[1:29:07] uh he's if i was envious and foolish
[1:29:09] keep going brother josh if you could
[1:29:12] verse verse 4 keep going please
[1:29:14] for there are no bands and they're death
[1:29:17] but their strength is firm keep going
[1:29:19] verse five
[1:29:20] they are not in trouble as other men
[1:29:24] neither are they plagued
[1:29:26] like other men
[1:29:29] you know what he was really saying
[1:29:32] they're not plagued like i'm plagued
[1:29:35] they don't have the trouble that i have
[1:29:38] and you know i give everything to the
[1:29:39] lord i've given my entire life
[1:29:42] while i'm denying myself and giving
[1:29:45] myself they grow rich and prosperous
[1:29:48] while i'm weak with sorrow their
[1:29:50] strength only increases
[1:29:53] verse 11. notice this as he goes further
[1:29:56] in this
[1:29:57] keep going and they say how does god
[1:30:00] know and is there knowledge now he's
[1:30:03] he's getting close to the line here
[1:30:06] is there knowledge
[1:30:09] in the most high
[1:30:12] in other words
[1:30:15] does does god not even is he not seeing
[1:30:18] the seeing this is there no does he not
[1:30:20] have a problem with this
[1:30:22] doesn't he see what's happening isn't he
[1:30:25] aware of this massive disparity
[1:30:29] between the righteous and the
[1:30:31] unrighteous
[1:30:32] when it comes to suffering and pleasure
[1:30:35] and poverty and prosperity
[1:30:41] he says is there is is is they say how
[1:30:45] does god know is there knowledge in the
[1:30:47] most high
[1:30:48] fair question how do they prosper yet
[1:30:51] we're constantly being deprived how does
[1:30:54] god
[1:30:56] have you ever wondered that question and
[1:30:58] asked how are the wicked
[1:31:00] devil worshipers i mean you can give
[1:31:02] some of the most heinous examples
[1:31:05] and yet
[1:31:06] physically
[1:31:08] and everything that you see
[1:31:10] it looks like riches and it looks like
[1:31:12] wealth and it looks just like pleasure
[1:31:14] and it looks just like prosperity
[1:31:18] and there's reward and they're promoted
[1:31:20] and i'm demoted and yeah i'm serving the
[1:31:23] lord and i'm paying my tithes
[1:31:25] amen
[1:31:28] amen
[1:31:29] internet audience amen
[1:31:34] yet they're given to the yet i'm given
[1:31:36] to the lord yet now now you see he
[1:31:38] starts to rationalize this from a human
[1:31:41] perspective
[1:31:42] and anytime you look at human pers
[1:31:44] anytime you look with your human
[1:31:46] perspective you only see through
[1:31:48] temporal temporary shallowness and
[1:31:51] veneer
[1:31:53] what you don't see is underneath that
[1:31:55] veneer of glitter and glam and happiness
[1:31:58] what looks like apparent happiness and
[1:32:01] looks like apparent prosperity there's a
[1:32:04] life that's full of drugs
[1:32:06] full of depression
[1:32:08] full of anxiety
[1:32:10] full of suicide at a young age
[1:32:13] it may look like it glitters and it pops
[1:32:16] on the outside and it looked that way to
[1:32:18] asaph in so much he says lord i don't
[1:32:20] understand it but what you miss is god's
[1:32:23] perspective at the issue
[1:32:27] because while you may not have much in
[1:32:29] earthly goods and you may not have much
[1:32:32] in in like in comparison to their life
[1:32:36] what you do have that they don't have is
[1:32:39] an eternal promise
[1:32:40] and an eternal hope of heaven and an
[1:32:43] eternal peace
[1:32:45] and an eternal joy that outlasts all of
[1:32:48] the worldly joy
[1:32:50] and in the time of calamity and the time
[1:32:52] of trouble yeah you're planted and
[1:32:54] you're rooted and you're grounded and
[1:32:56] you have faith in your heart
[1:32:58] hallelujah oh when moses came out of
[1:33:01] egypt he forsook all the pleasure and he
[1:33:04] forsook all the riches and he forsook
[1:33:06] all of the all of the popularity but and
[1:33:09] he looked like he came with nothing in
[1:33:12] his hand but you know what moses did
[1:33:13] have he had a promise from the man who
[1:33:15] created the whole world
[1:33:17] and that promise meant more to him than
[1:33:19] all of the treasures of egypt
[1:33:26] because they were shallow
[1:33:28] to the point notice this
[1:33:31] verily verse 13.
[1:33:36] let's just turn from that we're at 12 37
[1:33:38] now just running out of time i want you
[1:33:39] to get to my powerpoint if you have that
[1:33:42] let's look at it quickly if you could
[1:33:45] just for a moment
[1:33:46] notice what brother adam says here
[1:33:48] he says let us examine this is the
[1:33:50] legacy in church age let us examine the
[1:33:52] first phrase as many as i love
[1:33:57] in the greek the emphasis is upon the
[1:33:59] personal pronoun
[1:34:01] i
[1:34:02] he does not say as many
[1:34:04] he does not say as many would feel he
[1:34:07] should say as many as love me
[1:34:12] listen
[1:34:13] not as many as love me now you know the
[1:34:16] scripture that brother brandon is
[1:34:17] referring to as many as i love i rebuke
[1:34:21] and chasten be zealoths therefore and
[1:34:24] repent
[1:34:26] right amen
[1:34:27] that's the admonishment in revelations 3
[1:34:29] to the ladies in church age as many as i
[1:34:33] love now brother branham says now the
[1:34:34] personal pro now notice upon that he
[1:34:37] says the greek emphasis is upon the
[1:34:38] personal pronoun i
[1:34:41] he does not say as many would feel he
[1:34:43] should say as many as love me
[1:34:46] no sir
[1:34:48] we must never try to make jesus the
[1:34:51] object of human love
[1:34:54] in this verse
[1:34:57] no
[1:34:58] it is the many
[1:35:00] that are the loved ones of god
[1:35:04] it is
[1:35:05] his love in question
[1:35:07] not ours
[1:35:09] so once again we find ourselves
[1:35:11] glorifying in his salvation
[1:35:14] his purpose
[1:35:16] and his plan
[1:35:17] and we are confirmed even more strongly
[1:35:20] in the truth of the doctrine of the
[1:35:22] sovereignty of god
[1:35:24] even as he said in romans 9 13 jacob
[1:35:28] have
[1:35:31] i
[1:35:33] loved
[1:35:34] does it now obtain listen to this that
[1:35:36] since he loved only the many is he
[1:35:41] therefore in a state of complacency
[1:35:43] awaiting the love of those who have not
[1:35:46] drawn nigh him by no means is this so
[1:35:49] listen to what brother bannon says here
[1:35:51] even as he said jacob ever loved
[1:35:53] jacob have a love does it now obtain the
[1:35:55] since he loved only the many is he
[1:35:57] therefore in the state of complacency
[1:35:59] awaiting the love of those who have not
[1:36:00] drawn out of him by no means is this so
[1:36:03] for he declared in romans 9 13 esau have
[1:36:06] i
[1:36:07] hated and in verse 11 the spirit boldly
[1:36:10] calls out for the children not being
[1:36:14] born
[1:36:16] neither having done any good or evil
[1:36:20] amen
[1:36:23] follow jacob have i loved esau have i
[1:36:26] hated and paul says
[1:36:29] god made that choice god made that
[1:36:32] statement god looked at it that way
[1:36:34] prior to either one ever being born amen
[1:36:40] now if you don't believe that you just
[1:36:41] don't believe the bible
[1:36:43] this isn't a brother branham doctrine
[1:36:45] this is a bible doctrine
[1:36:47] brother branham's doctrine was what
[1:36:49] brother brennan didn't come with any
[1:36:50] thinking of his own or any teaching of
[1:36:52] his own it's a restoration of bible
[1:36:54] truth
[1:36:55] now we're looking at the love of god why
[1:36:58] the sons of god go through trouble
[1:37:01] and wicked prosper
[1:37:05] why
[1:37:06] the sons of god go through storms
[1:37:09] and go through trials and go through
[1:37:12] trouble even paul we looked at jeremiah
[1:37:15] we looked at elijah we looked at god's
[1:37:17] prophet and and you say brother matt why
[1:37:19] don't we look at all those so that you
[1:37:21] could know that if they went through it
[1:37:22] with the close-contact relationship we
[1:37:26] ought to expect the same thing for our
[1:37:29] lives
[1:37:32] and remember what paul said don't think
[1:37:34] it's strange when fiery trials are
[1:37:37] trying you
[1:37:40] don't think it's strange
[1:37:42] he says notice this
[1:37:44] he he in verse 11 the spirit boldly
[1:37:46] calls out for the children not being
[1:37:48] born neither having done any good or
[1:37:50] evil that this is the bible here in
[1:37:53] romans 9 that the purpose of god
[1:37:58] according to
[1:38:00] election
[1:38:03] might stand
[1:38:07] every
[1:38:08] thing that encompasses everything in
[1:38:12] life history past
[1:38:15] present and what happens tomorrow
[1:38:19] has never been about never ever ever
[1:38:22] ever been about
[1:38:24] what man the purpose of man or what man
[1:38:26] could accomplish or what man's going to
[1:38:28] do do you realize that that's on a
[1:38:31] that's on a that's on a large scale
[1:38:32] let's go to a microscopic scale your
[1:38:35] life
[1:38:36] not from the day you were born or the
[1:38:38] day you graduated high school or college
[1:38:40] or had a family your life has never been
[1:38:43] about your purpose
[1:38:47] whether you've ever realized that or you
[1:38:49] realize it presently it's never the
[1:38:51] world doesn't revolve around you
[1:38:56] amen it's always been
[1:39:00] for this that the purpose
[1:39:02] of him
[1:39:05] according to election might stand not of
[1:39:09] works
[1:39:11] but if him that calleth this love is
[1:39:14] say it with me elective
[1:39:17] love
[1:39:19] it is his love
[1:39:21] for his elect
[1:39:22] and his love for them is a apart from
[1:39:26] human merit
[1:39:27] for it says that the purpose of god
[1:39:29] stands an election
[1:39:31] did you follow what brother branham says
[1:39:33] here he says this love this elective
[1:39:36] love is apart from merit in other words
[1:39:40] lord i'm so grateful that you love me
[1:39:42] let me go through my list of everything
[1:39:43] i must have done for you to love me it
[1:39:45] doesn't have anything to do with what
[1:39:47] you've done or what you're gonna do or
[1:39:50] what you did before
[1:39:52] it's election
[1:39:55] it's apart from any human merit
[1:40:00] for it says the purpose of god sends an
[1:40:01] election once is exactly opposite to
[1:40:04] works or anything man has in himself
[1:40:07] because
[1:40:09] before the children were born
[1:40:13] he had already said jacob have i love
[1:40:17] but esau have i
[1:40:19] hated
[1:40:20] and now he says to
[1:40:23] his
[1:40:24] own go to the next line
[1:40:26] and now he says to his own paul's look
[1:40:29] this way i'm going to raise my hands i'm
[1:40:32] going to invite you to raise your hands
[1:40:33] with me i believe i am his own
[1:40:37] and i believe he's speaking to me
[1:40:40] and now he says to his own
[1:40:42] as many as i love
[1:40:45] i rebuke and chase him
[1:40:48] to rebuke is to reprove
[1:40:52] to reprove is to expose with the view to
[1:40:55] correction
[1:40:56] chasten does not mean to punish
[1:41:00] you know how many times we've looked at
[1:41:02] the chastening hand of god i'm just
[1:41:03] being punished it's just a punishment
[1:41:06] because we relate that or correlate that
[1:41:07] to our children or our child uh with
[1:41:10] with punishment i'm here i am in
[1:41:11] punishment you know we act like children
[1:41:13] sometimes
[1:41:15] with god we act like spoiled rotten
[1:41:18] children
[1:41:19] amen okay well i do maybe you don't want
[1:41:21] to admit it
[1:41:23] oh i'm just being punished
[1:41:25] you got to look at it you've got to look
[1:41:27] at it god's way it's not punishment
[1:41:30] because the way that we mean that is
[1:41:32] god's just hurting me because i hurt him
[1:41:35] and i'm messed up so he's going to mess
[1:41:36] me up
[1:41:38] and i made a mistake and i'm just
[1:41:40] reaping what i sow well yeah you know
[1:41:42] sometimes you do reap what you sow that
[1:41:44] is a law
[1:41:45] but the the corrective as many as i love
[1:41:48] i rebuke and chasten it's not punishment
[1:41:51] it's correction
[1:41:55] let's simplify that
[1:41:57] what is correction correction is when
[1:41:59] you correct i know that was real
[1:42:02] scientific and real uh you know i'm sure
[1:42:05] that you're you're you're missing it
[1:42:06] went right over your head it was so
[1:42:08] simple
[1:42:09] it just means to correct what does it
[1:42:11] mean to correct when your back's out of
[1:42:13] when you're when you when you're
[1:42:14] crippled and your back's messed up what
[1:42:15] do you do you go to the chiropractor so
[1:42:17] that he can correct your spine
[1:42:19] when you're in a car and you're going
[1:42:21] off the road you correct the car
[1:42:24] you correct it
[1:42:26] so his punishment why do you go through
[1:42:28] trial why is there tribulation why
[1:42:31] through tests because god sees the car
[1:42:33] veering off the road and so he brings
[1:42:36] correction
[1:42:38] amen
[1:42:39] all right chaston does not mean to
[1:42:40] punish means to discipline because the
[1:42:42] subject's amendment
[1:42:45] is in mind
[1:42:46] what does god have in mind when he
[1:42:48] starts sending trials your way and he
[1:42:51] raises the stormy wind this is what god
[1:42:54] has in his mind amendment
[1:42:58] this is exactly what we find in hebrews
[1:43:00] 12 5 through 11. give me about can i
[1:43:02] have about five
[1:43:04] six minutes raise your hand if you grant
[1:43:06] me that
[1:43:07] sorry for those that don't grant me that
[1:43:11] and you have forgotten the exhortation
[1:43:13] listen and you have forgotten the
[1:43:15] exhortation he's quoting here this is
[1:43:17] hebrews 12. you have forgotten the
[1:43:19] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[1:43:21] unto children my son despise not thou
[1:43:24] the chastity of the lord
[1:43:26] nor faint when thou art rebuked of him
[1:43:29] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:43:31] and scourgeth every son whom he
[1:43:33] receiveth if you endure chastening god
[1:43:37] dealeth with you as with sons for what
[1:43:41] son is he whom the father chastiseth not
[1:43:45] but if you be without chastisement next
[1:43:48] line but if you be without chastisement
[1:43:51] whereof all are partakers then are you
[1:43:54] bastards and not sons illegitimate
[1:43:59] furthermore
[1:44:00] we have had fathers of our flesh which
[1:44:02] corrected us and we give them reverence
[1:44:05] shall we not much rather be in
[1:44:07] subjection unto the father of spirits
[1:44:09] and live
[1:44:10] for they verily for a few days chastened
[1:44:14] us after their own pleasure but he for
[1:44:17] our
[1:44:18] prophet
[1:44:20] that we might be partakers of
[1:44:23] his
[1:44:24] holiness why whenever god corrects you
[1:44:29] it's for your profit
[1:44:33] but if you be without chastisement where
[1:44:35] for all the protections let me go past
[1:44:37] this now no chastening for the present
[1:44:40] seemeth to be joyous
[1:44:42] but
[1:44:43] grievous amen
[1:44:45] amen
[1:44:50] no chastisement for the present right
[1:44:52] now what i mean brother man you don't
[1:44:54] understand it doesn't feel too good
[1:44:57] it's not supposed to
[1:44:59] no chastisement in the present seems
[1:45:01] joyous but grievous nevertheless
[1:45:04] afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
[1:45:06] fruit of righteousness unto them which
[1:45:08] are exercised thereby
[1:45:11] listen to what brother adam says here
[1:45:12] i'm going to close hearing is now set
[1:45:15] forth the love of god
[1:45:18] he desired in love a family of his own
[1:45:23] a family of sons sons like himself
[1:45:28] there before him
[1:45:30] lies all
[1:45:32] mankind as one lump of clay
[1:45:36] out of that same lump he will now make
[1:45:40] vessels
[1:45:42] unto honor
[1:45:44] and unto dishonor
[1:45:46] out of the same lump
[1:45:50] god is god is you ever that's why we say
[1:45:53] everything that's happening in the world
[1:45:54] today
[1:45:55] is because of him
[1:45:58] some to righteousness some to
[1:46:00] unrighteousness some to honor some to
[1:46:02] dishonor
[1:46:05] herein is now set for the love of god
[1:46:06] and his art of family he says there out
[1:46:08] of that same lump he will now make
[1:46:10] vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the
[1:46:13] choosing
[1:46:14] will be
[1:46:16] his next slide the choosing will be his
[1:46:20] own
[1:46:22] choosing
[1:46:24] then those chosen ones born of his
[1:46:26] spirit will be trained to conform to his
[1:46:29] image in their walk
[1:46:32] he reproves
[1:46:33] with all long-suffering and gentleness
[1:46:37] and mercy
[1:46:39] he chastens next slide
[1:46:41] he chastens
[1:46:43] with nail scarred hands
[1:46:45] isn't that beautiful
[1:46:48] sometimes this potter must take the
[1:46:50] vessel he's working on
[1:46:52] and thoroughly break it down in order
[1:46:55] that he may rebuild it exactly as he
[1:46:59] desires it but it is love
[1:47:03] that is
[1:47:04] his love
[1:47:05] another way of his love there is not
[1:47:08] there cannot
[1:47:10] be
[1:47:13] he chastens
[1:47:14] he rebukes
[1:47:16] asaph
[1:47:18] you might not understand why you're in
[1:47:20] the trouble that you're in but just know
[1:47:22] god ordains the trouble
[1:47:25] you may not understand the trial you're
[1:47:27] in but just know god ordains
[1:47:30] the trial
[1:47:33] are you with me
[1:47:35] god ordains the stormy wind to raise
[1:47:39] god is the one who causes the stormy
[1:47:42] wind to raise
[1:47:43] as he says in psalms he says he he
[1:47:46] commandeth the stormy wind
[1:47:49] uh he he speaks to the stormy one i want
[1:47:51] to read you something i wish i could
[1:47:53] have displayed it brother jason to mars
[1:47:55] who's there i forgot to even mention
[1:47:57] vacationing there with his family in
[1:47:59] tennessee he said this to the ministers
[1:48:01] chat this morning just our group of
[1:48:03] ministry here so beautiful from a
[1:48:05] southern baptist minister paul washer
[1:48:08] i'm sure you've heard of paul washer
[1:48:09] sermons
[1:48:10] and he says something i just want to
[1:48:12] read it here
[1:48:13] it fits so well
[1:48:14] he says how is it
[1:48:17] that god demonstrated love towards jacob
[1:48:21] and hatred towards esau
[1:48:23] you never see one time god disciplining
[1:48:27] esau
[1:48:28] never once
[1:48:31] you never as many as i love i rebuke and
[1:48:33] chasten
[1:48:34] right
[1:48:36] paul says in romans 9 we read it
[1:48:39] jacob have i loved east all have i hated
[1:48:41] he made that choice before either was
[1:48:43] born he says you never see one time god
[1:48:47] discipline in esau
[1:48:49] never once
[1:48:51] but you see god beating jacob every day
[1:48:54] of his life
[1:48:58] when jacob came back into the land
[1:49:01] esau was so prosperous that he had no
[1:49:04] need of any wealth from jacob
[1:49:07] but when jacob comes back to the land he
[1:49:10] was limping and broken and had a new
[1:49:13] name
[1:49:15] what a portrait here's esau here's jacob
[1:49:18] when jacob comes back esau spends his
[1:49:21] life without correction without
[1:49:22] discipline from the lord
[1:49:24] jacob spends his whole life getting beat
[1:49:26] and spanked and disciplined every single
[1:49:29] day
[1:49:31] imagine jacob not looking around going
[1:49:33] god what in the world
[1:49:35] what's happening you spank me you
[1:49:37] discipline me man i can't get away with
[1:49:39] nothing and all esau gets away with
[1:49:41] everything
[1:49:42] you ever had a brother like that man
[1:49:48] he gets away with with everything man
[1:49:50] jonathan got away with everything didn't
[1:49:52] he chris
[1:49:54] or beat every day
[1:49:57] he could just get away with bank robbery
[1:50:00] and somehow he could always go and talk
[1:50:02] his way out of it i mean he in so much
[1:50:04] that when we would get in trouble and it
[1:50:06] didn't have anything to do with jonathan
[1:50:08] would say john go and be our lawyer
[1:50:09] plead with dad you can complete our case
[1:50:11] we just and he jonathan would go in
[1:50:13] there we wouldn't say nothing we'd just
[1:50:14] stand there
[1:50:16] and we'd get out of it
[1:50:20] true story
[1:50:22] could you imagine jacob could say this
[1:50:24] man i don't get away with nothing i just
[1:50:27] messed up just a little bit and bam
[1:50:31] esau spends his whole life you never
[1:50:32] read one time god ever disciplined and
[1:50:34] they're doing anything but jacob gets
[1:50:36] beated every day of his life and here
[1:50:38] jacob returns to the land and here's
[1:50:40] esau prosperous wealthy standing
[1:50:43] straight up and here comes jacob limping
[1:50:46] in
[1:50:47] the bible said he walked with a limp
[1:50:51] and he doesn't even have his name
[1:50:52] anymore god's renamed him
[1:50:54] i love this he says jacob when jacob
[1:50:57] came again esau was so prosperous that
[1:50:59] he had no need of any wealth from jacob
[1:51:01] but jacob was limping and broken
[1:51:04] why
[1:51:06] god
[1:51:07] disciplines
[1:51:08] his children
[1:51:13] why
[1:51:14] god
[1:51:15] disciplines his
[1:51:17] children
[1:51:19] because you are
[1:51:21] sons
[1:51:25] and discipline reproof
[1:51:27] correction it's never about punishment
[1:51:30] it's never about harm or damage or he's
[1:51:32] going to get you back for what you did
[1:51:34] don't ever look at it that way
[1:51:37] but god says you're my child and out of
[1:51:39] the same lump of clay when you start
[1:51:42] when you when your life begins to get
[1:51:43] deformed from my image of what i had for
[1:51:47] my son i'm gonna bring correction
[1:51:49] and that correction may not always be
[1:51:51] easy it may be painful
[1:51:55] but rest in this
[1:51:57] it's for your good
[1:51:59] it's for your profit
[1:52:02] it's it's so that you can prosper maybe
[1:52:04] not in the same way your neighbor
[1:52:06] prospers
[1:52:08] and i think so many times we try so hard
[1:52:10] to chase after our neighbor's prosperity
[1:52:13] and god says i'm not calling you to that
[1:52:15] kind of prosperity
[1:52:16] i've got a different prosperity for you
[1:52:19] and and it's and
[1:52:21] until you settle in with that fact
[1:52:23] you'll always be it you'll always be at
[1:52:25] war you'll always be in a struggle
[1:52:27] you'll always be contending you'll be
[1:52:29] like the heath in the desert you'll
[1:52:31] never have life but if you just
[1:52:33] surrender and rest and give it to god
[1:52:38] and say lord
[1:52:39] i lord i plan i want to be planted where
[1:52:42] you want me planted i want to chase
[1:52:44] after what you want me to chase after i
[1:52:46] want the prosperity that you want for my
[1:52:48] life i want the health that you've
[1:52:50] intended for my life i want the kind of
[1:52:52] life and shaped in the kind of way that
[1:52:55] you the potter my master my father has
[1:52:58] intended for me
[1:53:02] i love that so much jacob came back
[1:53:04] limping
[1:53:05] esau spent his whole life without
[1:53:07] discipline why because god disciplines
[1:53:10] his children
[1:53:12] that's love
[1:53:15] that's love
[1:53:17] asaph you might not understand it
[1:53:20] but that's love
[1:53:22] that's the love of god that we sing
[1:53:25] about when we say oh love of god
[1:53:29] oh how rich and pure how measureless
[1:53:33] and strong
[1:53:35] that may not be how the world has
[1:53:37] defined love
[1:53:39] that may not be how the world defines
[1:53:41] love and and they and they they they may
[1:53:44] not look at it that way at all and the
[1:53:46] world doesn't look at it that way and
[1:53:47] even the church world systems don't look
[1:53:49] at it that way
[1:53:50] but that's how god looks at it and
[1:53:52] that's all that matters
[1:53:54] we're not here to be pleased they they
[1:53:56] build churches massive
[1:53:59] many member thousand member churches
[1:54:01] and they they they poll pull the
[1:54:04] neighborhood and send a census through
[1:54:06] the neighborhood what kind of church do
[1:54:07] you want what kind of preacher do you
[1:54:08] want what kind of topics do you like
[1:54:11] what kind of what kind of music do you
[1:54:12] like what kind of band do you like and
[1:54:14] then they build a church based on the
[1:54:16] consensus
[1:54:18] i'm not making this up this is real
[1:54:20] they build a church in that neighborhood
[1:54:22] when they're doing a church plant based
[1:54:24] on the consensus of their polling
[1:54:26] numbers still you realize that they've
[1:54:29] reversed the love of god and now it's
[1:54:31] become the object is now the people and
[1:54:33] what they want and they build a church
[1:54:36] around their desires why do you think
[1:54:38] the bible says they would there would
[1:54:39] come a day when they wouldn't endure
[1:54:41] sound doctrine but they would heap unto
[1:54:44] themselves having itching ears teachers
[1:54:49] and they've built churches and they've
[1:54:50] built massive thousand many member
[1:54:52] churches where every day is about a skit
[1:54:55] and every day is about a play and about
[1:54:56] a drama and you have coffee in the
[1:54:58] vestibule and you bring your coffee and
[1:55:00] your donuts in church and you hear oh
[1:55:02] it's good preaching good i mean some
[1:55:05] good really good stuff and you can get
[1:55:07] little clips and snippets of really good
[1:55:10] things about health and about wealth and
[1:55:12] about prosperity and how god loves you
[1:55:15] and god's for you and god's with you and
[1:55:17] all of those things are true but do you
[1:55:20] realize it's what's
[1:55:21] that's why that's why
[1:55:23] jeremiah says that man will be like the
[1:55:26] parched desert he'll live spiritually
[1:55:28] dry that's why the churches have no life
[1:55:34] but you know we build when we build a
[1:55:35] tabernacle or sanctuary or we say we say
[1:55:38] we want a church it's not about what we
[1:55:40] want it's not about what we want
[1:55:41] preached it's not about what we want to
[1:55:43] hear
[1:55:44] it's about lord how can we be in
[1:55:46] subjection as your children to your
[1:55:48] purpose and to your plan
[1:55:50] and what you want for our lives
[1:55:53] i want to be the man who trusts in the
[1:55:55] lord who's like a tree planted by the
[1:55:57] rivers of water whose fruit and whose
[1:56:00] branches are spreading out
[1:56:03] in fruitfulness you say brother matt
[1:56:04] does that mean numbers no it doesn't
[1:56:07] doesn't mean numbers it doesn't mean big
[1:56:08] new churches or big fine steeples as
[1:56:11] brother branham says but what is where's
[1:56:13] the beauty of the church it's in the
[1:56:15] beauty of the hearts of the people
[1:56:18] because know you not you are a temple of
[1:56:21] the holy ghost
[1:56:22] you are the dwelling place of the lord
[1:56:25] you are the temple of the holy ghost
[1:56:27] you're to give your all and surrender
[1:56:29] your all and everything that paul says
[1:56:32] first that i might win christ you know i
[1:56:34] just want to say let that be my motive
[1:56:36] lord let that be my objection let it be
[1:56:39] everything that consumes me oh do you
[1:56:40] feel that way church and say lord i want
[1:56:43] to lay down my desire and my ambition
[1:56:45] and that i might win christ
[1:56:48] i want to count everything else in my
[1:56:50] life as nothing that i might win
[1:56:54] christ
[1:56:57] let's all stand if you can come
[1:56:58] musicians stand to your feet with me
[1:57:02] that i might
[1:57:05] win christ
[1:57:13] let's all bow our heads here
[1:57:15] if you could
[1:57:21] lord jesus
[1:57:24] lord we come to this close of
[1:57:26] father what you've
[1:57:29] what you've said not what men have said
[1:57:32] lord but we've read your words today
[1:57:35] how applicable lord how relevant they
[1:57:38] are to our lives
[1:57:40] as many as i love
[1:57:42] i rebuke and chasten
