[0:56] so
[1:38] so
[2:20] foreign
[2:34] so
[2:48] so
[3:30] okay
[4:12] now
[4:44] good morning everyone stand up we're
[4:47] gonna
[4:49] go right to the scriptures brother matt
[4:52] was
[4:53] supposed to take this morning and ended
[4:55] up that something came up just the
[4:57] emergency
[4:58] last second for him um and so
[5:02] we cancelled it but i was like well i
[5:03] haven't i didn't finish last week so
[5:05] the notes are ready give me five minutes
[5:08] to regroup here and we'll go we'll go
[5:10] forward so
[5:11] and you're sitting here so we might as
[5:13] well do it right
[5:15] amen so let's pray heavenly father we're
[5:18] just so thankful for your mercy and your
[5:20] grace lord and
[5:21] uh just this last minute thing i pray
[5:24] that you just
[5:25] your spirit would come upon me and upon
[5:28] each believer here lord and that we
[5:30] would each
[5:31] pull to receive something from you
[5:33] father
[5:35] we ask we only ask for your mercy and
[5:37] your grace lord for we're deserving of
[5:40] no good thing which you give to us so we
[5:42] commit ourselves to you for your glory
[5:44] we ask in jesus name
[5:46] amen so we'll start with the scripture
[5:49] um psalms 82.
[5:53] 6
[6:00] i have said be our gods
[6:03] you are elohim and all of you are
[6:06] children of the most
[6:08] high may the lord add the blessing to
[6:10] the reading of his word he can be seated
[6:22] and so last time last time i was
[6:25] speaking
[6:26] um about that
[6:29] the word elohim and talking about how
[6:32] that's
[6:33] it's uh people will say that that means
[6:36] that there's more than pers
[6:37] one person in the godhead there's three
[6:40] persons in the godhead
[6:41] but the word elohim means a it's a
[6:43] plural of majesty
[6:45] and you'll see it over and over again
[6:47] what happens is the reason why it is
[6:50] singular is that it's used in conjunct
[6:52] conjunction with singular
[6:54] pronouns over and over and over again to
[6:57] signify it's not plural
[6:59] other times it's used with plural
[7:00] pronouns
[7:02] to signify that it's plural so you've
[7:04] got to know the
[7:05] the context when it's ever used for
[7:07] jehovah elohim
[7:10] it's always singular it's never never in
[7:13] the plural
[7:15] if you look at let us make man in our
[7:18] own image
[7:19] and elohim said let us make man in our
[7:21] own image even in that context the very
[7:23] next verse
[7:24] immediately goes to singular personal
[7:28] pronouns in the image of god made he him
[7:31] male and female made he
[7:32] them and so you look at that and then we
[7:35] begin to look
[7:36] look at the bigger context last time of
[7:39] elohim and the different ways
[7:42] that this term is used we saw it was
[7:44] used in conjunction with angels
[7:47] we saw it was used in conjunction with
[7:49] false
[7:50] gods or demons
[7:54] we saw it was even used in conjunction
[7:56] with the judges or rulers
[7:59] of israel and jesus used it in reference
[8:03] to prophets
[8:05] and i think we got to the place where we
[8:06] saw the witch of endor calling forth
[8:09] samuel and she said
[8:12] i see elohim coming out of the earth
[8:16] so you know samuel
[8:19] being in that spiritual form coming up
[8:23] says i see elohim angels are spirits
[8:26] they're called elohim what is the word
[8:29] elohim
[8:30] really mean if you look in the scripture
[8:32] it doesn't necessarily mean
[8:34] object of worship like our english word
[8:36] means
[8:37] god it speaks of a mighty one
[8:42] or a ruler or an authority
[8:45] and we talked about that how there's
[8:47] there is only
[8:49] one elohim with the attributes
[8:53] that jehovah has there's no other
[8:56] elohim beside him even though there's
[8:59] many that receive the title
[9:01] of elohim
[9:06] i am trying to find where i stopped in
[9:08] my notes oh here we go
[9:09] so genesis 1 26 and 28
[9:13] we just referred to that
[9:17] so if you just want to pull that up
[9:22] people can see that let us make man
[9:26] in our own image after our likeness and
[9:28] let them have dominion
[9:30] so here he makes man
[9:33] in his image and we know that that means
[9:36] he makes him
[9:37] in spirit form first right brother
[9:40] branham says god is a spirit
[9:42] so what was man when he was initially
[9:44] made god's not repeating himself in
[9:46] genesis 1 to genesis 2.
[9:48] first he makes him his spiritual the
[9:51] spiritual
[9:51] aspect of his being then in genesis 2 he
[9:55] makes the physical
[9:57] aspect of his being but in this
[9:59] spiritual aspect he tells him
[10:01] take dominion and this is where you see
[10:03] brother branham will say
[10:04] make the statement he made him a little
[10:07] g.o.d
[10:08] god over the earth and guys like me
[10:12] would get confused
[10:13] by that when i first heard it coming to
[10:15] the message and say what does he mean
[10:16] because
[10:17] in other places he says god means an
[10:20] object of worship
[10:22] it's not that adam was an object of
[10:24] worship
[10:25] adam was an elohim a little elohim over
[10:29] the word
[10:29] earth what is that he's god's vice
[10:32] regent
[10:33] he rules in god's place on the earth
[10:38] right is he over god is he above
[10:41] god you know this is that's the problem
[10:44] is with
[10:44] today's new age thinking people
[10:48] start accusing brother branham of
[10:49] bringing a new age
[10:51] doctrine but it's not it's not it's very
[10:55] scriptural
[10:56] him adam and eve are
[10:59] the elohim over the earth
[11:04] they're to take dominion they're to
[11:06] multiply and replenish the earth
[11:08] and subdue it and have dominion
[11:11] over it there to rule in the place
[11:15] of god but in submission
[11:18] under god obviously so then we have
[11:21] we go to the next part satan's not ready
[11:24] to
[11:25] to leave that alone amen
[11:28] he's not ready to say i'm not going to
[11:30] rule over
[11:31] i'm i'm not going to let them rule over
[11:33] it i'm going to rule over this
[11:36] earth and so then he goes and says
[11:38] genesis 3
[11:40] 4 and 5.
[11:52] and the serpent said unto the woman
[11:56] you shall not surely die
[11:59] what is what is he doing here what is
[12:01] this what is his attempt
[12:03] that he's trying to do he's trying to
[12:05] rest
[12:06] dominion away from adam
[12:09] and eve he does not want someone else to
[12:12] be elohim over this earth
[12:15] he wants to be elohim over this earth
[12:18] and so he plays a trick on him
[12:22] look at what he does he offers them
[12:23] something that they already have
[12:26] he offers her something she already has
[12:29] for god for elohim doth know that in the
[12:32] day you eat thereof
[12:34] then your eyes shall be opened and you
[12:36] shall be as
[12:37] elohim knowing good and evil
[12:41] they're made in the image and likeness
[12:43] of who
[12:44] elohim now you're going to tell me i'm
[12:47] going to be more like elohim
[12:51] but she what was it she was deceived she
[12:54] was deceived adam
[12:55] was not deceived but eve being deceived
[12:59] was in the transgression
[13:00] adam identified himself with her with
[13:03] her sin
[13:04] but he knew exactly what he was doing
[13:07] he re he redeemed her but it put the
[13:09] whole earth
[13:10] into death
[13:14] that always strikes me as strange how in
[13:16] the world
[13:17] you already made them in the likeness of
[13:19] elohim
[13:20] now you're going to say well you'll be
[13:22] like elohim
[13:25] no wonder he didn't approach adam with
[13:27] that adam would said
[13:29] you want me to be more like that you
[13:32] think you're
[13:33] you think you can offer something that's
[13:34] greater
[13:36] than the only true elohim has already
[13:39] given me
[13:44] genesis 3 17-19
[13:54] and unto adam he said this is the curse
[13:56] that adam receives and unto adam he said
[13:59] because you have hearkened unto the
[14:00] voice of your wife
[14:02] and have eaten of the tree of which i
[14:04] commanded thee saying
[14:06] you shall not eat of it cursed is the
[14:09] ground
[14:09] for your sake in sorrow
[14:12] shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy
[14:14] life thorns
[14:16] also and thistle shall it bring forth to
[14:18] thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the
[14:20] field
[14:21] in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[14:23] bread till thou return unto the dust for
[14:25] out of it wast thou taken
[14:26] for dust our heart and unto dust thou
[14:30] shalt return hear the authority
[14:34] of adam though it's still there
[14:37] in a certain sense now it's lost
[14:41] now it's lost and the authority over the
[14:44] earth what is what does paul say in the
[14:46] new testament
[14:47] satan is the god of this evil age
[14:52] satan is the controller
[14:55] now and the title deed was in adam's
[14:59] hand
[15:00] but that title deed was now lost
[15:03] from ad from man and goes back to the
[15:06] hands of the original
[15:08] owner not it doesn't go to satan it just
[15:10] simply goes back to the original owner
[15:13] but now it's uh under the authority
[15:17] of the evil one he rested it out of
[15:20] adam's hand
[15:22] for it for a season it's under the
[15:24] authority
[15:25] of the evil one and he's the elohim over
[15:28] the earth
[15:28] so what is redemption going to do for us
[15:32] what is that going to accomplish romans
[15:35] 8
[15:36] 18-23 in
[15:40] in adam's fall it wasn't just that adam
[15:43] sinned and he's he receives death
[15:47] but that death passes on all
[15:51] everyone after that receives death but
[15:53] not even just
[15:55] humans not even just his seed the entire
[15:58] creation
[16:00] and not just this earth the entire
[16:02] universe
[16:03] is now made subject to this vanity
[16:07] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[16:09] present time are not worthy be compared
[16:11] with the glory which shall be revealed
[16:12] in us
[16:13] for the earnest expectation of the
[16:15] creature or the creation
[16:17] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[16:19] sons of god for the creature or the
[16:22] creation was made subject to vanity
[16:25] not willingly but by reason of him who
[16:27] has subjected
[16:29] the same in hope because the creature
[16:32] itself
[16:32] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[16:34] of corruption
[16:35] into the glorious liberty of the
[16:37] children of god for we know that the
[16:39] whole creation groaneth
[16:41] and travaileth in pain together until
[16:43] now and not only they but ourselves also
[16:46] which have the first fruits of the
[16:47] spirit even we ourselves
[16:50] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[16:52] adoption to wit
[16:53] the redemption of our body
[16:57] so we're waiting for that time where we
[16:59] have a new body
[17:01] whereas the sons of god are fully
[17:03] manifested
[17:04] in their glorified body in the full
[17:08] redemption now we have the first fruits
[17:10] of it now we have a down payment of the
[17:12] holy ghost
[17:14] in us which gives us access to
[17:17] the powers of redemption right so
[17:21] let's read let's read in uh adoption
[17:24] 1960 brother says but in genesis 2 and
[17:26] he made man
[17:28] he said i am yahweh jehovah what did it
[17:31] mean i'm the all-existent one who's
[17:33] created
[17:33] something off of myself to be a son of
[17:36] mine
[17:36] or a temporary or an amateur little one
[17:39] of mine glory
[17:41] why jehovah means that he gave man to be
[17:44] an amateur god because he is father god
[17:46] and he made a man
[17:47] an amateur god so he isn't self-existent
[17:50] anymore he exists
[17:52] with his family el ella
[17:55] elohim now he is jehovah jehovah meaning
[17:59] the one who exists
[18:00] with his family now god made man to be
[18:02] the predominant over all the earth he
[18:04] had dominion and the earth was man's
[18:05] dominion is that scripture
[18:07] then if that's his domain he was god
[18:10] over the earth
[18:11] he could speak and it would be so he
[18:13] could speak in it this and it would be
[18:15] so oh there he is god jehovah the one
[18:17] who once
[18:17] existed in itself existent but now
[18:20] exists with his family and his little
[18:22] ones with him now this may choke you to
[18:26] death but did you know that men are
[18:28] that are sons of god are amateur gods
[18:31] how many ever knowed that how many knows
[18:33] that jesus said so
[18:34] jesus said did you know your law itself
[18:35] says that you're gods
[18:38] and if you call them gods which god said
[18:39] in genesis 2 they were gods because they
[18:41] were had
[18:42] full dominion over of the world he gave
[18:44] him dominion over all things and he lost
[18:46] his godship he lost
[18:50] his sonship he lost his domain
[18:53] and satan took it over but brother we're
[18:55] waiting for the manifestation of the
[18:56] sons of god who will come back
[18:58] and take it over again waiting for the
[19:00] fullness of time when the pyramid gets
[19:02] up to the top
[19:03] when the full sons of god will be
[19:04] manifested when the power of god will
[19:06] walk out
[19:07] and will take every power that satan's
[19:10] got
[19:11] away from him yes sir
[19:14] amen amen
[19:17] so redemption has a purpose we lost our
[19:23] elohim ship our godship
[19:26] we lost that position that authority
[19:30] but the blood of christ what does it do
[19:33] it washes us it cleanses us it it's that
[19:36] clorox bleach that brother branham talks
[19:38] about
[19:39] in the sermon the in the breach
[19:42] and in god hiding himself in simplicity
[19:47] this uh another quote from adoption he's
[19:50] the logos that went out of god that is
[19:52] true that was the son of god
[19:54] then he made man that little god he said
[19:56] if they call those who are the
[19:57] who the word of god came to the prophets
[19:59] if they call them gods who the word of
[20:00] god came to and god said so himself that
[20:02] they were gods
[20:04] he told moses i made you a god and made
[20:06] aaron your prophet
[20:07] amen i may act like i'm a religious
[20:10] crank but i'm not oh when your eyes can
[20:12] come open and see those things all right
[20:14] he made man
[20:16] a god a god in his domain and his domain
[20:18] goes from c
[20:19] to c from shore to shore he has the
[20:21] control of it and when jesus came being
[20:23] the one
[20:24] god without sin he proved it when the
[20:26] winds blowed he said peace be still amen
[20:29] when the tree said no man eat from me
[20:31] verily i say unto you
[20:32] you that's little gods if you'll say to
[20:34] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[20:36] in your heart believe
[20:37] that what you've said will come to pass
[20:39] you can have what you said
[20:41] go right back to genesis to the original
[20:44] what is it
[20:45] now the world and nature is groaning
[20:47] crying everything's moving what
[20:49] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[20:51] when true sons born
[20:52] sons filled sons speak and their word is
[20:55] backed i will
[20:56] believe we're on the border of it right
[20:58] now yes sir
[20:59] say to this mountain let it be so again
[21:02] like i said
[21:03] the fullness of that is going to be in
[21:05] the millennium
[21:07] when we have a new body operating in
[21:09] that
[21:10] full authority taking dominion that was
[21:13] taking the dominion that was lost but
[21:16] but we have the first fruits of the
[21:18] spirit
[21:19] right now we have that authority now
[21:23] in a sinful world in a fallen world to
[21:26] do
[21:26] what to speak to speak
[21:30] not speak whatever we want jesus said i
[21:32] don't do anything
[21:34] unless the father shows me first he says
[21:37] i don't do my own will but the will of
[21:39] him
[21:40] that sent me he made
[21:44] you and i to be little elohim on this
[21:47] earth
[21:48] number one is what do we do we create
[21:51] the atmosphere around us
[21:52] right by this everyone does that whether
[21:55] you're
[21:56] saved or not saved
[22:00] if but as sons of god we have a greater
[22:04] supernatural power that we can create
[22:08] an eternal authority around us
[22:12] a a eternal atmosphere around us
[22:15] that changes lives again we're not to
[22:18] receive worship
[22:20] we're not forgiving people's sins that's
[22:23] not what we're talking about when we're
[22:24] talking about
[22:26] being elohim it means we are simply a
[22:28] vessel
[22:30] as i said before a vice regent you know
[22:33] what a vice region is
[22:35] when the king is not here he puts a vice
[22:38] he's off on
[22:38] on a trip i'm not saying god's off on a
[22:40] trip
[22:42] but humanly speaking when when the king
[22:45] is away he appoints a vice regent
[22:47] to rule in his place and whatever he
[22:49] says
[22:50] that's it that's the fi that's the final
[22:54] right but he doesn't rule by his own
[22:56] idea his own will
[22:58] he receives instructions from the king
[23:03] and we serve an invisible king right
[23:07] and he wants to flow himself
[23:10] from that invisible realm those
[23:12] invisible dimensions
[23:14] through us to this world
[23:19] so we look we look at this
[23:23] further i want to grab
[23:26] the quote from that i have here
[23:35] yeah um from faith is the substance
[23:39] after the days of that came along jesus
[23:41] he was god's end sign
[23:43] and he was lifted up he ascended on high
[23:45] and gave gifts back to men and men
[23:46] received the baptism of the holy spirit
[23:48] to made
[23:49] to be made deity himself
[23:53] amen he says no that didn't set very
[23:55] good
[23:57] but that's according to the word a man
[24:00] or woman that's born to the spirit of
[24:01] god is a part of god amen your sons and
[24:04] of god and daughters of god didn't jesus
[24:06] say isn't it written in your
[24:07] scriptures your laws that your gods not
[24:09] to forgive sins now
[24:11] but your sons and daughters of god
[24:13] limited to your faith
[24:15] what is he saying we operate in this
[24:18] position what by faith
[24:22] what is faith something that you work
[24:25] yourself into
[24:27] something that you force no faith is a
[24:29] revelation
[24:30] so you're operating under submission
[24:33] to the one that calls you
[24:37] and second
[24:40] peter verse 1 chapter 1
[24:43] verse 4 is where we'll finish today
[24:47] ii peter 1 verse 4
[24:50] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[24:53] great and precious
[24:54] promises that by these
[24:57] you might be partakers of the divine
[24:59] nature
[25:01] having escaped the corruption that is in
[25:03] the world
[25:04] through lust we are partakers of
[25:08] divine the divine nature partakers
[25:12] speaks of being a participant
[25:15] so we participate or we share
[25:18] is another way to say it we share in
[25:21] what the divine nature
[25:25] so what does that mean what does divine
[25:26] mean
[25:28] it's it's uh similar to the word
[25:31] god in uh in greek
[25:35] it has a small difference instead of
[25:37] theos
[25:38] which is the regular greek word for god
[25:41] it's theos so there's an i added in the
[25:44] middle
[25:44] middle and it when it that i is added it
[25:47] means
[25:49] god-like or like
[25:52] god and then where it says nature it's
[25:55] the word phusis which means
[25:58] germination or expansion
[26:01] or natural production so what is it what
[26:05] is
[26:06] peter saying right there we share
[26:10] in the god like
[26:13] uh uh uh descent right
[26:17] what does brother branham say you're
[26:18] from the genes of god
[26:21] so if if birds
[26:25] produce birds and cows produce
[26:29] cows what does god produce
[26:34] divine beings gods
[26:37] no we're not objects of worship we're
[26:39] not forgiving sins
[26:41] we're simply vessels for god to work
[26:44] it's another way of saying you're sons
[26:45] and daughters of god
[26:47] but it's a it's a it's a more clear it's
[26:50] a deeper i should say
[26:52] understanding of that that we have his
[26:54] name it's not merely
[26:56] well you be you're like the
[26:58] denominational say you're adopted
[27:01] sons of god in other words you weren't
[27:03] sons of god
[27:04] but he comes and he says oh look these
[27:06] poor people they don't
[27:07] they're just orphans they don't have
[27:09] anybody i'm going to come and make them
[27:11] my sons that's not the picture of the
[27:14] scripture because you are
[27:15] sons he sends forth the spirit of his
[27:17] son
[27:18] into your heart well by you cry abba
[27:20] father you receive the spirit because
[27:22] you are sons if you're not a son
[27:24] you're not going to receive the spirit
[27:25] and why are you a son because you have
[27:27] the divine
[27:28] germination in you
[27:32] you have the divine seed in you the very
[27:35] life of god is in you
[27:37] and that me that doesn't just mean
[27:39] something static
[27:41] that means something that's moving
[27:42] that's that's uh that's uh
[27:44] life is not stagnant life moves
[27:47] works operates it's not just hearing the
[27:50] word
[27:51] it's hearing it and then living it
[27:55] or another word say becoming the word
[28:00] right the word becoming flesh and the
[28:02] flesh
[28:03] becoming word amen let's pray
[28:06] and stand if you would
[28:11] heavenly father we just come to you now
[28:12] lord and we're so thankful for your
[28:14] beautiful word how it's been unfolded
[28:17] to us today in such a humble way
[28:20] lord but such an incredible way through
[28:22] your prophet
[28:24] things that the world is denominational
[28:27] systems are scared of and
[28:29] run away from or or refuse to comment
[28:32] about
[28:33] lord you've you've made them plain and
[28:36] clear to us
[28:38] through that ministry of malachi 4 and
[28:40] we're so grateful for that lord
[28:43] we're we're partakers
[28:46] of what that prophet has brought lord
[28:48] and we're blessed
[28:50] we ask your blessing upon the worship
[28:52] upon the preaching of the word may your
[28:54] name be lifted up and glorified
[28:57] we ask in jesus name amen god bless you
