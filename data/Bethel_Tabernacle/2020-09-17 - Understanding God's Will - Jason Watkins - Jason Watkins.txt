i preached on the wednesday night so i'm really looking forward to it i trust that you have come expecting something from god amen amen you it all it all depends on your expectations so you know if you come with the right expectations the lord will sure meet that amen we're going to turn to the book of ruth this evening and um just a little small book following the book of judges actually used to be a part of the book of judges but it was separated out just before samuel as its own book actually they think samuel probably penned the book of ruth told the story so i want to speak to you tonight on understanding god's will understanding god's will and we have a number of uh prayer requests that we'll get to here just shortly amen i don't know if that if this guy battery got changed okay excellent i'll start to say if it if it goes dead you can always use this amen unless i'm down in front walk in the aisles amen praise the lord amen ruth chapter 1 it's a lengthy reading so i want to just get right into it going to catch this whole chapter now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons the name of the man was elimelech the name of his wife naomi and the name of his two sons malone and charlon euphrates of bethlehem judah and they came into the country of moab and continued there and elimelech naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of the one was orpah and the name of the other ruth and they dwelt there about 10 years and milan and chileon died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband then she arose with her daughters in law that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of judah and naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law go return each to her mother's house the lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me the lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people and naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for i am too old to have a husband if i should say i have hope if i should have a husband also tonight and should also bear sons would you tarry for them until they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands name my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord has gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissed her mother-in-law but ruth cleaved unto her and she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and under her gods returned thou after thy sister-in-law and ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou goest i will go and where thou largest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god where thou diest i will die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death partly in me when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her so they too went until they came to bethlehem and it came to pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this naomi and she said unto them call me not naomi call me mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty when they call why then call you me naomi seeing the lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me so naomi returned and ruth the moabitess her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest amen let's pray father we thank you for your word this evening and i am just surrendering myself into your hands so glad to be standing here lord ministering tonight so happy to have friends here gathered out with us and some visitors here with us tonight lord we're just and you want to enjoy the word and enjoy the presence of god and the presence of one another this is a refilling station for us lord in the middle of the week so i pray you tank us up real good now and help us and instruct us lord for we want to look into the into the ways and the will of god at times it leaves us wondering but lord we know whom we have believed lord and so we commit ourselves to you fresh tonight for the ministering of the word committed to you in jesus name amen god bless you as you're seated amen praise the lord you made it amen praise the lord happy to have with jesus linda here with us amen so amen brother larry praise the lord good to see you buddy amen i'm pastor watkins amen praise the lord ah what's going on in beliary there a little bit amen miss that handsome mug amen so traditionally as we said the the book is credited to samuel and the book of ruth was actually read at the feast of harvest i think we've got a microphone on back there so if you want to kill that for me i think bradley has his mic on yeah we did okay yep amen hey they did okay amen you got him dead i mean is mike off good amen praise the lord yup they did a good job appreciate all that singing so it's interesting and because this is actually such a perfect type for us the book of ruth because that it came at the harvest time at the beginning of barley season and so the book of ruth is actually read at the feast of pentecost because so much of the story is set in the harvest fields um it's it's it's um and that's significant because brother branham talks about um how that the barley the the fact that it was barley season meant that it was the time of fresh bread and so we realized in brother branham typing it as he preached a number of times out of this book of ruth that because it meant fresh bread then it correlates directly to our day so if you go and hear kinsman redeemer or revelation chapter 5 or the breach or any of those you'll hear brother branham uh making these connections that's why in fact as he took this story in the breach because it's the time uh moving between the ages and and the seals and so it comes at barley now right on the heels of barley season is wheat season it's interesting that by the time ruth gets to wheat season she's married amen and she has she she owns it all amen so you can see i don't i don't think i have to spend too much time uh making connecting the dots for you um just to give you that reference that brother branham gave us and so we can see it in the scriptures you know understanding god's will sometimes it's bizarre amen sometimes it makes no sense humanly speaking but you know i i i when i read my bible it it it warns me in advance that the ways of god are not like my ways and in fact is it tells me i'm glad it does it gives me kind of a a warning that his ways are so far his thoughts are so far above my thoughts and my ways and how i would do something and you know something friends i am one to testify to you here tonight that i'm glad it's that way i'm glad he's in control trust me you don't want me to be in control of all this and i don't want you to be in control of this we want him to be in control of it all so whatever comes i think as believers here at the end time and we're looking at some very strange and unsettling times but jason and i were at lunch today talking about that very thing that you know things are happening and it's coming in not not like we expected there is so much that is happening and i'm here to tell you it's not exactly how we were looking for it to unfold you know you say well what's ahead well i know generally what's ahead but what it's going to look like yeah i'm going to tell you something friends as i was saying to you sunday you're going to want to be really close to him now you're going to want to be really close i'll say it again you're going to really need to be close that was what the lord told israel when they were headed to a wilderness and said now make sure you stay close to the preachers stay close to the ark stay uptight don't don't don't be stragglers because you've never been this way and uh some things are going to happen that are going to surprise you and so we look at this trying to understand god's will sometimes friends you know i want to just say this outright and i know that you have experienced it sometimes there is no human understanding of god's will sometimes things happen and god does it in a certain way and leaves you astonished at his way sometimes you feel like you're the one on the getting the sword into the stick and yet god did it [Applause] amen so you know this is where brother branham said you know in that that that that that when you have prayed and you're in a situation and and god doesn't seem to be moving and you've turned over every stone and you've done everything you've checked everything everything in your life is get gets a check box your your motive your objective is good but god still sits silent and brother branham says that's the time that's when you've got to be certain of god amen now what does that mean it means that i i know him and i know he'll do the right thing i know whatever he does would be the right thing he's not he might not do it at all like i think would be the right thing what he might do i might think it's the wrong thing but because i'm so certain of him then i can say well yes i i know that the god of all like abraham said that be far from thee to kill the innocent the righteous with the wicked and he said shall not the god of all the earth do right think of that faith that abraham had abraham wasn't you know trying to front on on melchizedek abraham was just simply making a statement of faith i know you i know you'll do the right thing and so you know in no matter what we're facing in this life if you're going to try to understand god's will understand this principle first all his word is true and all of his ways are just amen and just determine that now in advance before you know what happens tomorrow determine right now before i get to tomorrow before i face whatever it is i don't know that i'm gonna face i'm deciding right now all of his word is true and all of his ways are just and i won't need any evidence to make me think that tomorrow and fact is i will still think it if every piece of evidence flies in the face of them amen amen i don't think there is any opening chapter in any book of the bible to me anyway that within the space of one opening chapter that you have something start with such promise and such hope only to end an unspeakable yes amen heartbreak amen you know this man of judah with his family you know he's uh he he's he's trying to feed a family trying to get trying to get along trying to do the best he can he's part of the chosen heritage of god it's true that when an israelite leaves the promised land he's backslid and i get that and sometimes men in a little bit of you know back backsliding isn't always like some over the cliff like you you're back in a bar on a barstool right sometimes backsliding just means you don't pray quite like you used to you don't have quite the relationship that you used to have with the lord and so you start making edgy decisions that you wouldn't have made right you don't get quiet on me this fast we're just getting started you know i grew up in a church where they would always say if you can't say amen say oh me oh my oh goodness and so they there's a famine yeah this this is this this is thought to be probably the 12th century bc sometime around when the when gideon was on the scene in the midianites you remember invading the land and even gideon the deliverer is down in a hole hiding and eli there's not much help going on in the house of god because eli you know what's going on with him and his sons and so you know what's a man to do you can't you know you're you're the deliverers hiding the the the priesthood are corrupt there's famine in the land what's a man to do i got mouths to feed and so you know what he does he he leaves before it gets bad he sees it coming remember naomi said her testimony was i left full i came home empty so they he doesn't wait he's he's savvy he doesn't wait you know forever to lose everything he just goes ahead and says look i think we better hightail it to moab and kind of lay low for a while and you know nature will take its course and this famine will uh will break and sure enough it did after 10 years or so and so here they are you know trying to help themselves during a time of severity in the land of israel and you know they're they're they're part of god's chosen people just like you just like me and i mean there's some times where you just say man i'm just trying to get by i mean i'm doing my best brother jason i you know i'm i'm i'm i'm god i'm trying to make it to church i'm i'm trying to feed a family i'm trying to raise children i'm i'm doing all these things at one time and husbands and wives and and are good working together and i mean let's face it sometimes friends we can find ourselves in a calamity and you really don't understand it because you're you were doing the best you could amen i mean i'm just trying to survive here you know am i not a chosen come on member of god's family sure so were they yeah you know i'm not running out sin and neither were they amen you know and they said to her verse 10 surely we will return with thee unto thy people and naomi said verse 11 turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way if i'm too old to have a husband if i should say i have hope if i should have a husband also tonight and should also bear sons would you tarry for them till there until they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands i mean listen friends naomi and arpa and ruth are in quite the impossible situation amen amen three widows back to back to back such promise a husband two more husbands everything's going good left with plenty and suddenly hudson number one's dead husband number two is dead husband number three is dead and here's three ladies yeah amen right out in out in the middle of nowhere with no no social services no pension no government gonna step in and three women and one of them elderly turn again name my daughters for he grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord has gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orbit kissed her mother-in-law but ruth cleaved unto her there's something about ruth or something different she was a moabite just like orpah was she was a daughter-in-law just like orpah was she was married to a hebrew just like oprah was she had a hebrew father-in-law just like arpa had she loved naomi orbit loved naomi but now somehow there there's some kind of a different revelation that begins to take place and you can't put your finger on it and there's not anything that would that would add up to go why would ruth but but not orpah she's go ruth stays why why is ruth even staying that almost seems crazy it almost looks like corpus the smart one yeah right but you know when you when god begins to reveal something to your heart you don't always understand it it don't always make sense but you as a son and daughter god how many children of god can witness with me tonight when god starts dealing with your heart you don't you just have to go that way and you can't always explain it and it doesn't even make sense to the man in the mirror and you look in the mirror go what are you doing [Music] oh have i ever experienced that take actions as a pastor preach a certain thing make a certain decision and you know even even and sometimes sister daddy say why'd you decide to do it like that you know not contending with me just curious why did you decide because it wasn't what i thought you might would do why'd you decide to do it like that and i said well i wish i knew amen i wish i knew what's up all i know is i know better than to disobey that voice amen amen see i i found out the hard way you don't do that i said no no you hear that voice that still small voice and you know it's god and you've got enough training now you've been doing this long enough you know what you know what that voice sounds and feels like and so she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back into her people and under her god's return though after thy sister-in-law and ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or return from following after thee for wither thou goest i will go that's crazy where thou largest i will lodge well thy people shall be my people and thy god my god where thou diest i will die is this woman lost leave of her senses where you die i'll die and there i'll be buried she doesn't even know what's ahead she's never even been to the land she's planning to go to she knows nothing about it the lord do so to me and more also if all but death so apart me and thee and when she saw that she was steadfast-minded to go with her she then she left off speaking i'm gonna tell you something she she heard ruth uh bind her soul i'm here to tell you something friends long ago i bound my soul to this word and i and he never told me it would be easy he only told me it would be worth it but and i i don't always understand my life and i don't understand the ups and downs i don't understand my own self but i i bound my soul to this thing and the whole world can think i'm crazy and if i'm the only one left standing that believes this then i'll just have to be the only one left [Applause] hallelujah so they too went until they came to bethlehem verse 19 and it came to pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this naomi see so this remember this is correlating to our day this is the barley harvest when the fresh manna when a fresh revival starts and and then it's going to go to a wheat harvest and there's going to be a pure word and we're going to have a restoration of of the family of god in the earth and this is this is the time when when israel is going to go back under the trumpets amen because remember the trumpets the seals the vials the plagues they all run you know synchronously like that and so while the seals are breaking to the gentiles the trumpets are breaking to the jews and sending them home amen and so so you're seeing this type these beautiful types here so so this is the time when israel long gone has now returned she's been gone she left with plenty and now they've been gone and israel been gone and but but in the but in the harvest time at the time of the feast of pentecost now they're now the trumpets are moving and israel's starting to come back to their homeland and this is now only representing the old orthodox church and she said unto them call me not naomi call me mara for almighty have dealt very bitterly with me who could blame them for feeling this way after two thousand years of torment and persecution and death and pogroms and concentration camps and and ever government trying to slaughter human she says i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty why then call you me now only seeing the lord have testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me and it would it would take a profit to interpret this verse because it types israel returning yeah and call it the tender hand of jehovah right wow that to this day blows my mind so naomi returned and ruth the mole bite is her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest so this time at the at the harvest of pentecost because uh ruth now as a gentile so this is the time of the final harvest this is the the process leading up to where you know god has already sent a prophet he's he's kind of one born out of season from the azusa revival and it's kind of that in-between place where he's trying to pull the church together and yet they're closing doors on him and then the seals are going to open and then a brad's going to be born amen so i'm not trying to place all that here that's not what my sermon is about tonight i just want you to be really really glued in that this is you this is now all right and so you know this is the time of the of the harvest for ruth who's a gentile who's going to represent the gentile bride who's going to marry boaz who represents christ amen and it's going to come down to where there's another nearer kinsmen and brother branham says that represents the devil who could not redeem her because the problem was he said i can't do it because i i i'll mar my own inheritance and brother branham shows how that what that simply means is is that he could not redeem because the devil he couldn't redeem you from sin because he himself is a sinner yes amen it would take somebody who's not that to redeem and that's boaz that's christ hallelujah amen he tried but he couldn't do it remember the book of life when adam lost it it went to the devil but brother brown said but his filthy hands couldn't hold it and god took it back so we find then that you know just as this last day bride whose story ends quite well amen amen oh yeah hey our future is bright hallelujah i know it's trouble but listen your future is bright amen and just as this last day bride ruth's story ends quite well the story of ruth ends with a with the most beautiful ending but it it had to go through a lot to get there that's what i'm coming tonight to try to understand the will of god in the getting you there part amen i mean it's going to end for ruth she could have never hoped she's going to be married to the lord of the harvest inheriting all the wealth and bounty of the land and even the land itself she rose to a station above all others who had who had labored far more for her far longer than her and she just went right past and went all the way and married the lord of the heart all right hallelujah you know i've seen splendor i've stood at buckingham palace and i've walked the streets of monaco along the french riviera and the opulence and the the extravagance were stunning sister debbie and i we were laughing most of the time walking around monaco we felt like fish out of water oh my goodness two country bumpkins and people of such high estate and such fabulous wealth and the whole country and the city dedicated to to be a playground of the rich and famous the whole nation you know when when back in the days when diana wha becoming the princess and you know i mean the whole nation of england was in love with her yeah the whole world everybody loved everybody glued to their tvs i've read that that set a record of the greatest viewed thing that it smashed all records everybody watching the the wedding and the the carriage procession of charles and diana grace kelly was the same way you know these women moved to the front of the line in a moment simply by winning the heart of the prince it's all it took and grace kelly becomes the princess and diana goes from a certain family level and just rockets to the top princess all because they win the heart of the prince england and monaco love them and you know when when ruth ascended to mary boaz chapter four uh shows us we're not going to read it but i might read one portion of it uh give me four uh 11 and 12 because you're going to find that there's no there's no covetous envy there there's no jealousy there's no strife the the whole estate loved her loved loved boaz watch and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we are witnesses the lord make the woman that has come into thine house like rachel and like leah i mean this was some of the the best things they could these were some of the best blessings they could ask for her amen may she be like rachel and leah which too did build the house of israel and do thou worthily in ephrata and be famous in bethlehem and let thy house be like the house of pharas who tamar born to judah of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young woman they loved boaz they admired boaz with with an undying loyalty you read the story it's only four chapters long you read about his servants they're so loyal they're he tells them don't you touch her and they won't they won't go near her he tells them you drop handfuls of purpose and they drop them you know all along the way so she can pick him up she's headed she's headed to the top but she's got some struggles to go through she's got some work some labor she's got today amen and so they were thrilled for him you know just like the bible tells us how that angels rejoice any time a sinner is saved any time a prodigal son comes home angels rejoice it's so difficult friends to imagine the kingdom that we're going to amen it's so hard to get your mind wrapped around the a place of perfect love i mean just like here everybody's happy yeah not everybody's getting to marry the prince not everybody's going to live in the castle but everybody's happy there's no envy there's no jealousy there there oh boaz way to go oh she's beautiful all the women wanted to be ruth and all the men wanted to be boys and they're the heroes of the story that's how it ends that's how it's going to end for you it's a mr jesus and this is jesus hallelujah the world will stand in all of it friends there's nothing to compare there's nothing to compare in this life to the status that ruth the moabitess would attain there's nothing to compare to what you're headed for amen you remember that in the heat of trial and times when the enemy is attacking you you just you just put it in your mind this can't last forever i got a new world a new body a whole new life and it doesn't matter what happens here hallelujah until then as the song says until then my heart will go on singing until then with joy i'll carry on in the midst of trials no matter what it is it's difficult to imagine you know but but remember to to rule at that level for ruth to ex to achieve that for this bride to achieve the station that she's going to achieve there has to be character building every man there has to be friends to rule there has to be character and right you know i i thought about you know in in history i thought about down through the history how many armies have marched into battle how many brave knights and brave gallant men and lost their lives and women became widowed and children became orphaned oh you know fought these hard battles and bled out on battlefields just to just to place a mortal man on a throne yeah amen and then only to see him unfit yeah with no character and and see him literally become a traitor to everything that they bled and died for and sacrificed their lives and sacrificed their fortunes history is replete with that covered up with that joan of arc gave her life trying to trying to put the dolphin of france on the throne and she accomplished it he turned on her and sold her out to the catholic church and they burned her at the stake amen how many friends have have have gave their lives and wasted them just to put a a frail man on a throne and put a crown on top of his head oh my i'm here to tell you something friends we're headed for somewhere and there's no way to build character apart from suffering otherwise listen otherwise the kingdom that we're going to won't last you understand jesus had to suffer you've got to suffer because we're not looking to put somebody on the throne who can't handle it he's not looking for a bride who can't handle rulership oh my what a cruel that would be the cruelest thought in all creation amen something on such a scale as the as the book of revelation describes that we're going to something friends on that scale of of i john says i i saw a city oh and foundations and gates of pearl and the glory of god streaming brother branham says a tree of life down the river of life and angel choir singing that's what we're headed for hallelujah hallelujah what a what a tragedy that would be if we if we put king jesus on a throne only to have him characterless and to see everything that nature has grown for and mankind has grown for and we've had to we've had to run always trying to run from the certainty of death and always trying to secure ourselves and we go through all of this and get there and we find out our king is no good that's the kind of thing i want that ain't what i'm striving for that ain't what i'm striving for that ain't what i'm living for i want a king who's gonna stay the king who's full of character and full of wisdom and tells the truth all the time every time always his all of his words are true and all of his ways are just and if i want him if i want to have that kind of a husband he wants that kind of a pride who can take the test and stand there and say i'll take the way with the lord despise you i'm going to prove it here on this earth i'm not going to get there and and be a an unworthy queen with the king amen we've had to live under the curse of sin mankind always as i said always running from the certainty of death well guess what friends this time it's for keeps when you get that new body you ain't ever going to have to give it up again amen hallelujah when you get that new world guess what you ain't never going to have to come back here and do this again you'll be out of the devil's reach forever and finally even the devil will be destroyed and death and hell will be destroyed hallelujah amen amen so there would have to be times there would have to be times of what may seem a cruel trial an affliction such gain that ruth acquired such gain that we acquire it would have to include at times loss sometimes incomprehensible loss brother branham says from the kinsman redeemer coming back sad speaking of naomi coming back sad her husband dead her children dead with two daughter-in-laws then she turned musta and looked upon them and said why would you go with me now you can't do nothing but have trouble she said i'm i'm sorry that the hand of god is stretched out against me and naomi wondered why has the hand of the lord been so cruel to me wow my daughter-in-law's god has cast me out and i'm an outcast i don't know what i've ever done but i'm an outcast see brother branham says god was working his program wow that's right right god was working his program because all things work together for good to them that love god ready ready five words no matter what it is amen amen now how many will agree to that five no matter what it is god was working out his program because all things work together for good to them that love god no matter what it is this has to be our story also friends for we gain it all yes amen amen it's the promise of the word amen we gain it all just just say that yourself i gave it all i win amen and it wouldn't take long to become wife to the lord of the harvest once once she comes back she gets back at the beginning of barley season by the time wheat season follows it at the time of the threshing of the barley she's already being is already a proposal yeah and by the time by the time wheat harvest is coming she's already married and she's thought she's the lady of the manor glory and so i i know we're here and i know it's rough but hey it ain't going to be long i'm here to tell you it ain't going to be long naomi's already home hallelujah barley and harvest and wheat are already here there's already been an invisible union it ain't gonna be long it wouldn't take long to become the wife of the lord of the harvest but it would take labor yeah it would take patience she would have to work in the field she had the rights to the gleaner of the gleaner under under levitical law and the different different laws concerning harvest they couldn't harvest the corners of their crop because that had they had to keep that for the poor and and then the gleaners came through they didn't even need the owner's permission they had the rights of the gleaner given to them by god and so you know you're just gleaning the harvest is already done and you're just trying to get the scraps and this is her life this woman who's going to be the queen of the whole wow the whole the whole estate she's going to be the first lady of the whole estate right and boaz is a very wealthy man yeah this is this is huge and so we find out that he's there's only the in fact is the man who was closer to her which was the devil couldn't afford it he didn't have enough to pay the bill but boaz had plenty got plenty don't worry he's got plenty say it's going to take a lot to get me he's got plenty but she's going to have to suffer this loss she's going to have to journey she's going to have to follow her revelation all the way to the end no shortchange no stopping now you can't get to the point where it says oh man i made a mistake i probably should have went with orpah no you shouldn't have oh maybe i should go join her no you shouldn't stay the course stay the course i know the world's crazy i know it's getting hard but stay the course we're almost home amen might be some labor ahead of us but don't worry he's commanded his servants to feed you they'll drop handfuls of purpose just to keep you going it ain't the whole package but it'll get you there hallelujah it would take labor it would take patience as i said preaching i think last sunday maybe in the sunday school class i don't remember uh that john says i'm your companion in in tribulation and in the patience of jesus christ and i'm i remember making the point that it john says i was in the spirit you're going to need to be oh yeah otherwise you you're not going to have the patience for what we're facing amen you're not going to you're not going to be able to handle that tribulation you're gonna you might start out as a companion with john but you're not gonna hold out yeah you're gonna need to be in the spirit you're gonna need to handle the level of rejection that it's gonna require to be the bride of christ to handle that that kind of rejection worldwide if you if you really if this is really your life you're going to be rejected yes brother branham makes a statement i don't have it in front of me i can't quote it but i'm gonna i can paraphrase it very close brother bannon says you know uh he says that that if you're if you're going to be successful in this world you better not be a christian all right think about it he says if that's going to be your goal he's just trying to let you off now don't waste a bunch of time with the gospel just go be successful because you're not going to be able to do both so what's important to you that becomes the question what's best for you spiritually because i'm here to tell you at the end of the day that's all that matters it's going to take patience you're going to need to walk in the spirit you're going to have to have your nature change it's going to have to take faith in the promise of boaz when she gets that promise she she she gets some instructions from naomi how to do it you know and and she goes to the threshing floor in the night when he's married and he's laying there and she uncovers his feet and pulls it over herself it's a it's a it's an old hebrew custom what she's asking for is marriage but she can't just say will you marry me she pulls the cover over to get him to to get him to agree i'll i'll marry you will you marry me yes i'll marry you and so she's asking for a proposal amen and so he he says i'll do it and he commends her her character and he says you've been above reproach we've noticed you and you know you you didn't run with the young men and you you've showed more grace than all the others and i'll do it for you i'll do it for you tomorrow i'll go and there and and the problem is there's one closer to you than me and he actually has the rights of first refusal because you were born in sin so the devil had the first the first dibs and so boaz comes to the jesus comes to the devil and says will you buy naomi and he goes yeah i'll do it he says well if you take naomi you also have to take ruth the moabitess and then you have to raise up children to the dead husband and then he says well if i raise up children to her they'll get my inheritance and my kids won't get anything no i can't afford it i don't want to do it and he couldn't redeem her anyway because he himself needed redeemed i needed one who didn't need redeemed i need one who had never been sinful i needed one who was virgin born who was a product of the spoken word of god amen and so she but she would have to have faith in that because he just didn't jump up and run off into the nights and i'll be right back i'll be right back with the contract said you're going to have to just lay here till morning you're talking about a sleepless night i don't know whether she was sleepless for excitement or fear will he really do it this is crazy what am i doing i mean who is who am i to this guy naomi told me i came he did it and here we go i guess i'm getting married tomorrow it seemed too good to be true i was just in mo i was just in the land of moab i had a husband my goodness just months ago i had a husband i had a brother-in-law i had a father-in-law they all died and orp was gone and i followed my mother-in-law here and i've worked in the fields and i'm getting married i'm gonna go from nothing to everything i'm gonna tell you something friends the night might have been long but she had to lay there and believe it and believe it and believe it and believe it and when the sun come up and he said now quickly go out so that no one sees you leave and then she has to go back to naomi and she says i did what you told me and then naomi says all right daughter now rest you can rest because why how can i rest i'm a nervous wreck no no no no no rest if boaz promised you you don't have to worry yes you rest because he won't rest until this thing is finished [Applause] thank you lord amen it would take brother branham said there had to be ruth deciding and ruth serving and then ruth resting and then ruth rewarded that's right and so those three had to be in place to get to four she wasn't going to go just jump the line she was going to have to decide she made a decision the opposite decision of orpah she made what seemed like a crazy decision but it was a revelation then she had to serve she had to serve a mother-in-law she had to serve in the field she had to work so so you know there's she's she's she's deciding she's serving and when she made those two things and was willing to serve then she could and believe the promise then she could rest yeah and because she rested and didn't pull the panic button and sound alarms and she just did everything that naomi said and everything boaz said because you know why that's all she could do she couldn't make herself the mistress she couldn't make herself the first lady of the manor all she could do is trust the promise amen and through what must have been a long night she had to lay there and believe it she had to have faith and believe that god was in it all right she had suffered incomprehensible loss you know all of which i i thought i just thought about that all day today all of that suffering i mean ruth you're talking about an innocent bystander she's just a moabite girl who you know catches the eye of a hebrew man in her own country and you know boy meets girl and sparks fly next thing you know she's married next thing you know he's dead next thing you know she's walking to another country next thing you know she's in a field somewhere and and the bible said it was her hap h.a.p it was her hat to enter into the field of boys you know what that meant it meant it was fate it meant it was unplanned uh unplanned human human offend she didn't go in there thinking i'll go get the right field i'll go i'll work and i'll become lady uh laura you know i'll become first lady it was just her hap just you know that's what happens when you walk by revelation god just sees to it that you end up in the right place at the right time and the right person comes along hallelujah amen and all of this you know this incomprehensible loss none of it no fault of her own the loss of a father-in-law brother-in-law's and they were all close i mean they they stayed together as a family i think i think of the bond in my own family you know i i i've met people you know i don't want to get too broad and you know but but you know our family's always been close brother eddie sister gene you know we were always close sister debbie came into the family and became like a daughter and uh you know and and and my parents became like her parents because we after a while moved away she's lived mostly away from her parents since we've been married had some years there but the majority by far overwhelming majority have been away from her parents and her own siblings you know i my sons go out and find good girls and and our family's close and you know i i i know that that this daughter-in-law loved her father-in-law i know my daughter-in-laws love me i i think of the the devastation you know what what a devastation it would be to my girls if something happened to me what a devastation it would be to you know god forbid you know poor rachel her heart to be broken if something were to happen to chris because that's her brother-in-law who she loves and you know rachel loves matt and and matt loves katie and and and and they all love john we all love jonathan believe it or not no we do really right chris [Laughter] but but but i thought of the tragedy because this was real life all her security gone her safety gone you know she had to feel numb at such a loss as that i mean this isn't just a fairy tale this really happened to a lady amen this really happened to her it had to be you know how cruel how numb she must have felt you know all the loss and yet yet the hand of god was in every moment yes amen every step god's hand was controlling it all amen every step god's purpose was happening just remember friends your your life is happening yeah amen you're the word happening amen and i'm here to tell you that there has to be training there has to be character built in us this was all for purposes you think about you think back and put yourself in in ruth's place this is all for purposes that she couldn't possibly comprehend at the time not in her wildest imagination arrive in a strange land follow her mother-in-law in as far as she knew she had nothing and could expect nothing and yet god was going to raise her above every other woman in the land god knew what he was doing the whole time she would come to understand through trials that everything has a purpose everything and she came to understand through trials understand bride understand through your trials through your hardships through rejection through the having to exercise the patience of christ being a a fellow a companion in tribulation with john how many are willing to be a companion to john he represented you in the book of revelation it all has a purpose god had a vision here's the secret here's the simple truth what was it all about god had a vision of her say you mean god wasn't figuring it out as he went along no no no everything from the time she was a little girl and a moabite heathen nation heathen home heathen church heathen customs nine years old running around the house god saw her and knew her and had a vision for where she was gonna and every single piece and every single thing that was incited there was all god's plan and all god's doing even wow wow she's an unbeliever living in a heathen worshiping false gods the true god had his eye on her right got a few more minutes i'm not going to go too far with this because uh carry on sunday but enough i'm going to turn a corner you know brother branham talks about things he had to learn i was listening the other day to the breach where he talks about boaz being the goel uh the redeemer for ruth and it was so important brother branham he talks about in his own life how that he had had to learn by suffering you know he doesn't particularly mention it here he but we we know from the stories that he he had to learn to obey god in south africa because god had already told him what to do and he let a bunch of preachers get him in a pickle and force him and pressure him to do something different and when he went to god and god said and he said lord i'm in a jam because i let these men sponsor me and now it kind of really is bad if i don't do it the way they want to do it i've told them you said i should go here first they said no the logistics are bad you know it's not going to work the best way to do it is start here and we'll end up there he said but god told me to start here first then we can go there no brother branham you know we went to a lot of expense to bring you over here because brother adam had no money yeah so you know he made the same mistake luther made when luther let let that prince you know uh protect him and then he was kind of it's like a politician getting elected and then then his constituents come back and you know somebody once wants paid yeah and so god said all right you you go but you're going to pay a big price and brother branham walks out walks out door he comes in billy tries to tell him daddy you do whatever god says he said it's all right billy and brother branham comes out from praying and all these preachers even brother bosworth brother billy i i believe you've you've missed it this time no really son you know brother braham said that old veteran he said that hurt my heart worse than anything brother bosworth even doubted and and he says so brother branham went outside what is he doing prophets do do weird things he goes out and gets a bunch of leaves a bunch of leaves walks back in with a pile of leaves and puts it on their feet as a sign i have no idea what it meant but he caught an amoeba they caught amoeba the whole as the storm came ripped ripped their tents apart the whole thing was a disaster and yet still god got glory out of it we talked today about the meetings in durban amen and think of what it could have been if they if they'd went the way god told them to go brother branham had to learn that see he had to learn to go against family when when he wouldn't go to those pentecostals because his mother-in-law dug in and said you're not going to take my daughter and hope said no billy i'll go with he said no it's all right honey we won't do it. and brother branham called it the worst mistake he ever made he had to learn through hard trials to obey god even when he would say he's about to make a statement and he says ten thousand of my friends will leave me for what i'm about to say you think he didn't say it he went right and said it you know why because by that time he knew to obey god he knew that if ten thousand friends didn't like the word then he didn't need those ten thousand friends amen brother branham had to be trained he talks about there in the breach he said you know he said just like a a vision he said i see it and there's a certain there's a hat sitting there and and there's a child going to be healed and he had to learn not to move the hat yeah amen and that's hard to do friends sometimes in life you can see what needs to happen and you're going to try to help god don't move the hat say oh i need this obstacle out of the way if i could just get rid of this obstacle i'm going to get ahold of this obstacle and i'm going to move it don't touch it it's there for a purpose you can't move it let somebody else has to move it brother man says i can't do a thing he says i can't move it neither can i tell anyone else to move it he says i have to wait and then when someone else moves it without me saying a thing then i can step forward and say thus say it the lord amen see he almost killed a child one time doing that run he didn't wait for the hat to get in the right spot yeah see and so he had to learn you can't you can't move brother brown said we got to wait for things listen friends i know that the world we live in right now strange and uncertain and unsettling and it's crazy saying what's going on what's the election when's the rapture you know my goodness is the world this crazy and we're in covet and we're locked down we've got half the church here and oh wow our fellowship hall is closed up when are we ever going to get back to normal i don't think we are right right i don't think we are and i'm going to tell you something friends if staying not normal gets me closer to that world and i say don't ever go back to normal listen friends covet has taken a lot of people out of church who don't even have an interest in hardly ain't coming to church anymore and they're getting called on god saying what are you going to do about it all i can do is preach the word and let god handle his own bride amen but i and i say lord handle me too do to me what i need you to do hallelujah oh you can't move brother i said see you can't move ahead of him don't try see this is where the right now this is where the patience of christ it's paramount john says i was in the spirit on the lord's day you're in the lord's day you better be in the spirit amen the lord's day is a time of terrible terrible sweeping end time end of world things happening end of extinction events are close you understand this ain't like the the old days where we've come to a new time it's not going to back up and it's not going to slow back down again i believe we're already marching oh i just say lord whatever it takes just bring it on i i want to press on into the battle if i got to go through hardship i want to have the spirit you better have the spirit of christ you better have the patience you better be willing to be a companion in tribulation amen the patience of jesus christ ruth was a woman who caught a revelation of faith that was given to her it seemed crazy to orbit seemed crazy to naomi i would dare imagine that along her journey probably seemed inexplicably crazy to ruth i think that ruth only knew one thing i can't go back hallelujah i can't go back that's right no way i'm not going back orpa can go back that's not my revelation say what's forward i don't know about it [Music] what's ahead i don't know but i ain't backing up i'm committed i'm going forward i'm going forward to to uncertainty i'm going unforward to to a certain degree of the unknown there's a lot that i do know i do know god sent a prophet i do know we have thus saith the lord i do know the angel of the lord's presence is among us i do know there is a fresh surge i do know where there is another out a filling of the holy ghost i do know there's a third poll i do know there's a power of the word i do know there's a bride how do you know because i'm in it and i'm not backing up i can't go back i gotta go forward there's no back it's all forward so come on bethel tabernacle let's go forward don't let comet sit you down slow you down back you down go forward hallelujah she wasn't you know it was just a hab she's not thinking about a throne she's just trying to survive she's trying to care for her mother-in-law this is life this is just life i'm here to tell you tomorrow you're sitting here tonight and you're under the anointing of the preaching and it's exciting and we love it but you know what guess what's waiting on you tomorrow regular life you're still going to have bills you're still going to have a job you're still gonna owe taxes you know we're still dealing with a crazy world you're still gonna have to wear a silly mask to go in public oh my goodness but go forward go forward have courage oh my amen she cared for her mother-in-law it matters who you care about god saw her heart and loved her for it god was loving her friends even when the opposite seemed true yeah even naomi had lost all faith remember she comes back home said don't even call me naomi anymore ruth ruth had to encourage her ruth had to build her faith back up come on let me let me go i can't sit here and hold your hand all day let me go into a field and work let him go my daughter god be with you and her hap was she comes into the field oh hallelujah oh orpah poor orpah she's not a bad woman she just got caught in all that too human of a weakness of self-preservation and suffering what a human weakness that is you know when you when in human suffering that whole thing of self-preservation and orpah just she's not a bad woman she loved naomi she also wept over the calamity the calamity of it all but you know there was there there was there was a revelation that struck ruth and and maybe it wasn't even apparent to her but you know it was only god only had it disguised as calamity amen can i say that to you friends i don't know what might be happening in your life but don't worry it's for your good say it's a calamity no it's only disguise like that but it's for your good accept it embrace it go forward say in the name of jesus i claim it i take it i can do all things through christ who strengthens me amen or but never caught that same revelation that ruth did god was behind it all you know i i i think about ruth's journey you ever you know if if you're if i'm somewhat of a romantic and i used to love to play that trick where i'm gonna maybe get my wife a new ring or something she's a ring freak she loves rings but but nothing else she doesn't care about anything in life because she loves loves hey man and so so um so i love this thing where you know i'd get a big box and it rings this little tiny it's a little little box like that so i'd get a big box and i would i'd put the ring in a bigger box and a bigger box and a bigger box and then put it in a big box and then close it up wow this looks like you're gonna get an amazing gift and she would open it and it's a smaller box and she opens it and it's a smaller box and it keeps getting smaller and smarter looking like it's getting less and less a lot of times you're looking at your life ruth could look at her life and say man it's getting less and less and less but actually there's a diamond ring down on the inside and when you get down to that last little box it's worth it all that's exactly what ruth was getting she was getting a diamond right she was getting uh she was getting in the sense of a word she was getting a diamond she was getting boaz she was getting she wasn't going to have to settle for handfuls of purpose if she got boaz she gets the whole field she gets the whole estate and so this revelation just keeps unfolding keeps unfolding you know there there this this inexplicable knowing that that it's hard to describe to the world but you just you can't quit you you know that okay i opened another box and there's another disappointment and another box and it's another disappointment well you just might as well quit i can't why do you keep opening boxes i don't know something tells me there's a payoff something tells me if i just keep narrowing it down and narrowing it down i'm going to get the best prize of all i don't need the big boxes i don't need the medium size give me that little bitty box as long as it's got the ring in it that's where we're at friends are there's a revelation there's a ring that's wrapped around your heart of divine love and you know what you you know what you know what it causes it caused you to say no matter what i can't quit why can't you quit i don't know i just can't that's really bad you got nothing but trouble i don't know but i can't quit i gotta go i gotta keep going i to keep moving hallelujah there's a revelation something has struck my heart you keep going right even when you don't really know how you're going you ever been there friends you keep going and you don't even know how you're going you just you just know i can't stop i can't reverse her last trial was to rest in faith she'd done all she could do ruth got to a point where more work wouldn't help all she could do was rest right she had done all she could do she followed every instruction that only gave her she followed every instruction boaz gave her now she came to perhaps the hardest thing for the bride to do here at the end time rest rest in the covenant rest in the word rest in this fact that blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear amen many have wanted to and we're not able to and you're it amen guess what you're it rest little bride all is well say all is well the world's nuts right all as well it's crazy it's hard it's hot it's heavy trial you don't know what's going on in my life you know i i don't need to know here's what i do know all things work for your good amen just keep pressing just keep trusting just keep believing keep going forward we're going to break into a new day here pretty soon friends oh how is he going to get me there i don't know i don't know how he's going to get me there but i know i've done all i can do and so i just have to raise up my hands tonight and say lord i've done all i can do i've believed all your word i got weaknesses still but i believe you're worth that somehow you're gonna redeem me out of this you you started a good work in me you're going to finish this working hallelujah friends that's what i'm believing tonight come what may let the calamities come let the trials come but i'm pressing i'm pressing forward can't turn back satan is on the rampage the world is going insane but i believe the report what are you doing about it i'm hearing i'm recognizing and i'm acting upon the word of god hallelujah there's a land beyond the river stand with me they call the sweet forever amen but we only reach that shore by faith's decree how many want faith's decree one by one we gain the
