[44:22] just in the next little bit here
[44:25] praise the lord we're continuing by the
[44:28] help of the lord in our series on the
[44:30] coming of the lord this would be part
[44:32] three i'm pretty sure that's going to be
[44:34] correct guys should be part 3
[44:38] of the coming of the lord
[44:41] all right i want to read from revelation
[44:44] 10
[44:44] 8 to 11. i don't know if i sent that to
[44:47] you
[44:48] brother josh i apologize if i didn't
[44:50] amen i put it on my nose but i don't
[44:52] remember sending it to you revelation 10
[44:54] verses 8 to 11.
[44:58] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[45:00] spake unto me again and said
[45:02] go and take the little book which is in
[45:05] the which is open that's a big point in
[45:08] the hand of the angel which standeth
[45:11] upon the sea and upon the earth and i
[45:14] went into the angel and said unto him
[45:16] give me the little book
[45:18] and he said
[45:20] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[45:23] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[45:25] be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[45:28] and i took the little book out of the
[45:30] angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[45:33] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i
[45:35] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[45:38] said unto me thou must
[45:40] i'm not hoping you will not you really
[45:43] should thou must prophesy again
[45:46] before many peoples and nations and
[45:50] tongues
[45:51] and kings
[45:52] so
[45:53] you know a prophet went home
[45:56] more than a half a century ago why are
[45:59] we still here
[46:00] because once he went home and the bride
[46:03] became the final voice to the final age
[46:05] there was many people
[46:07] and nations and tongues and kings that
[46:11] she had to prophesy to
[46:13] so it's taken us this long to find all
[46:16] of god's family all the lord has it in
[46:18] his sovereign control doesn't he amen so
[46:21] let's uh let's pray
[46:23] father we want to thank you tonight lord
[46:26] for your great grace and your great
[46:28] mercy
[46:29] to us lord in this hour and father we
[46:32] have read your word but now lord we need
[46:35] you
[46:36] uh the divine one lord to give us divine
[46:39] inspiration upon the word that you
[46:42] brought to us we committed into your
[46:44] hands lord in jesus name amen god bless
[46:48] you friends you can be seated
[46:50] make a quick adjustment here
[46:54] amen
[46:58] praise the lord
[46:59] now i'm i'm i um
[47:03] i want to by the help of the lord to
[47:06] carry on in this thought and you might
[47:08] wonder i suppose it would be fair of you
[47:11] to wonder wow you're going to take a
[47:13] sermon like this for a wednesday night
[47:15] well when i get going you'll understand
[47:17] why
[47:18] because it's actually going to be a
[47:20] perfect service for a wednesday because
[47:23] you know this gives us some time where
[47:25] things sir where we can really kind of
[47:28] get down and and preach into our hearts
[47:31] tonight and and and you know
[47:33] what what is a real burden we're not
[47:35] trying to teach a subject to tonight
[47:37] like we were
[47:38] on sunday and like we will again the
[47:40] lord willing coming this coming sunday
[47:43] when we take the fourth part don't know
[47:45] if that'll finish it kind of got my
[47:47] doubts but
[47:48] i sure am enjoying studying and i'm
[47:50] enjoying ministering and i hope it's a
[47:52] benefit for you
[47:53] but tonight i want to take a particular
[47:56] angle and fact is i i want to really uh
[48:00] strike uh right away
[48:02] and i want to use some some words that
[48:06] are not weighty words but they're very
[48:08] direct words and they're going to convey
[48:11] what i really want you to grab a hold of
[48:13] right out of the gate
[48:15] and and that is that i want to say
[48:18] that what we're going to speak on
[48:19] tonight is aiming at a not just an angle
[48:23] and purpose of this coming in revelation
[48:27] 10 but it's actually a major angle and i
[48:31] i i almost can't over emphasize
[48:34] that you just take my word for it this
[48:37] is what what what we're really trying to
[48:40] get to i was trying to get to it sunday
[48:42] i don't feel i did a very good job i'm
[48:44] going deeper into it tonight we want to
[48:46] go into it even further next sunday this
[48:48] coming but this is a major angle and
[48:53] purpose of this coming now you can say
[48:55] well the
[48:56] the 10th chapter of revelation uh you
[48:59] know uh told us about how that christ
[49:02] would come with an open book and we'd
[49:03] have a prophet and and he would come and
[49:06] we'd get the open book and and you know
[49:08] we would we'd eat on that book and
[49:10] that's all absolutely true but to what
[49:12] end
[49:14] what's the purpose of it why did god do
[49:16] that we automatically know god doesn't
[49:19] do things to entertain us
[49:21] he doesn't do things that don't have a
[49:24] divine purpose behind it and while there
[49:27] are many angles that we can take and we
[49:29] have taken we talked in part one we
[49:32] showed you the symbolism and that was an
[49:34] important part to get you to understand
[49:37] that in the symbology of that angel with
[49:39] a rainbow over his head and fetus
[49:41] pillars of fire remember face like the
[49:43] sun in a it came as a living cloud you
[49:45] remember that that we showed by the
[49:48] scripture that that was that that was
[49:51] symbolic of christ in the bride that and
[49:54] we don't have time we're not going to go
[49:55] back over all that tonight
[49:57] but we've preached that steady the last
[49:59] two parts showing that that this coming
[50:03] is christ in you you've got to remember
[50:05] something friends and here's another big
[50:07] point
[50:08] the world today in christianity the
[50:11] world over
[50:12] 99.9
[50:15] and that's a conservative uh guesstimate
[50:18] not maybe more than that but 99.9
[50:21] of christianity when you when you talk
[50:24] about the coming of the lord they are
[50:26] thinking about the nail scarred man
[50:30] they're thinking about the man with nail
[50:32] scars and a side and and and a brow
[50:34] where thorns had been but they don't see
[50:38] that version of jesus until revelation
[50:41] 19.
[50:43] the only version of jesus that the world
[50:48] sees before the tribulation is in you
[50:53] that's why brother branham called this
[50:55] coming a bride coming of christ because
[50:59] it's now christ coming to tabernacle
[51:02] himself in his bride by a token with a
[51:06] jubilee returning the abstract bringing
[51:09] us now in visibly uniting us to our
[51:12] groom and therefore this was necessary
[51:15] because remember the church ceased being
[51:19] the mouthpiece of god but god has never
[51:23] been without a witness
[51:25] and when the church forfeited their
[51:27] rights to be his mouthpiece he called a
[51:29] bride out of that church that church is
[51:32] now her own mouthpiece she's full of
[51:34] creeds and dead but he has a living
[51:37] bride
[51:38] amen that's why it came as a living
[51:40] cloud so i had a rainbow that's why it
[51:42] was pillars of fire that's why his face
[51:44] shone like the sun oh my goodness
[51:46] friends this this is the this is the the
[51:50] coming that he has waited to do
[51:53] since the days of pentecost in the upper
[51:55] room
[51:57] remember he couldn't come that way like
[52:00] like uh to to and to take them into a
[52:03] body change because they backslid and as
[52:07] we've said before when they backslid
[52:09] instead of christ being able to come and
[52:11] take a bride he has to sit back down in
[52:14] the eternities intercede for ignorance
[52:16] for two thousand years put seven seals
[52:19] on the word of god that that word was
[52:21] never uns it was never sealed to paul
[52:23] everything that we have unsealed came
[52:25] from paul and so we find that this was
[52:28] the time when he would open up the seven
[52:31] seals would and he's literally opening
[52:33] up the lamb's book of life but to do
[52:35] what to what end what's the main purpose
[52:39] to to convert you into him
[52:44] see so you've got to you when you say to
[52:47] somebody oh the coming of the lord they
[52:48] automatically think of the time when the
[52:50] christian church goes home but there's
[52:52] all kinds of examples of coming of the
[52:54] lord
[52:55] all kinds of examples when he met
[52:57] abraham uh or from the slaughter of the
[52:59] kings that was a coming of the lord
[53:02] when he came to the tents in the plains
[53:03] of mamrie that was a coming of the lord
[53:05] when he met moses
[53:07] all down through the bible these are
[53:09] comings of the lord
[53:11] when he came in the upper room it was a
[53:14] coming of the lord yes i will brother
[53:17] matt tested negative for covet so don't
[53:19] anybody worry amen
[53:21] amen praise the lord he tested negative
[53:23] so we're happy for that it's just a kind
[53:25] of common head cold going around i think
[53:26] i had it myself and still got my voice a
[53:29] little bit ready but we're gonna get
[53:31] through it anyway
[53:33] so so we're
[53:35] we're looking now
[53:37] at this particular coming when he came
[53:39] in his earthly incarnation that was mr
[53:42] jesus when he came that was the that was
[53:44] the christian era
[53:47] we're not in the christian era now
[53:49] that was when jesus the christ was on
[53:51] the earth that was the christian christ
[53:54] era
[53:55] we are in the holy ghost era
[53:58] see it's the same god not a different
[54:01] person but now it's that god tabernacled
[54:04] in his body
[54:05] so now there's a mrs jesus christ
[54:08] because he's got to come in this day and
[54:09] restore
[54:10] like the the first adam fell and the sec
[54:13] first at first he fell well when the
[54:15] second adam came and restored adam there
[54:17] also had to be a restoration of eve
[54:21] so we find then that this major angle
[54:24] and purpose of this coming and i got to
[54:26] get moving
[54:28] a major angle and purpose of this coming
[54:30] in revelation 10 which is underway right
[54:34] now
[54:34] the coming of the lord is underway
[54:38] you're in it
[54:39] it's happening in real time
[54:45] this this major angle and purpose of
[54:49] this coming
[54:50] is to have the entire
[54:53] planted field come to maturity
[54:58] just like the wave sheath came to
[55:00] maturity in our day
[55:02] and a prophet came and reached a
[55:04] perfection to where god had enough
[55:06] confidence in him to put the words of cr
[55:09] the power of creation in his mouth
[55:12] i'm here to tell you something friends
[55:13] that has to come on the entire field
[55:17] see
[55:19] now satan has done a marvelous job at
[55:23] distracting us from that by by by trying
[55:27] to get people to that are so enamored
[55:30] with the prophet himself i get it he was
[55:33] a great man fulfilled his destiny
[55:35] finished his job went home to his reward
[55:39] but satan has got people so enamored
[55:41] with that vessel that they never come to
[55:44] realize this coming is more about you
[55:47] than it was him
[55:51] his ministry occupied a single verse
[55:53] you've got four or five verses you're
[55:55] here my brother my sister
[55:58] you have arrived you're you are you're
[56:00] not only in you are the coming of the
[56:02] lord oh hallelujah
[56:05] you are the coming of the lord
[56:09] it only climaxes in a body change
[56:13] the coming of the lord is in you and
[56:14] it's happening
[56:18] so he
[56:20] he unsealed the lamb's book of life
[56:23] he sent down the word of god into your
[56:26] hearts that you
[56:28] might be able to overcome the world
[56:33] when he was mr jesus on earth he said i
[56:36] have overcome the world
[56:38] said in the world you'll have
[56:39] tribulation be of good cheer i've
[56:41] overcome the world see
[56:44] now it's time for his bride
[56:47] mrs jesus to realize the same thing
[56:53] that's
[56:54] what
[56:55] revelation 10
[56:56] is all about
[56:59] when he was mr jesus on the earth in his
[57:02] earthly incarnation
[57:04] he said
[57:05] satan cometh
[57:07] and findeth nothing in me
[57:11] this was a this was a a a a a man
[57:15] remember jesus was not half man half god
[57:19] he was a hundred percent a human man he
[57:22] was also a hundred percent the very god
[57:25] this is why brother branham said he was
[57:27] he was he was god plus
[57:30] you see he was the god man
[57:33] see
[57:34] and so so we because he he was the
[57:36] prototype he was a he was the beginning
[57:38] of the creation of god he was a brand
[57:40] new kind of a human that god was going
[57:42] to fill up his entire kingdom with
[57:45] by the giving you the same life that was
[57:48] lived in him and giving you word bodies
[57:50] that are in a perfect condition
[57:54] this is what revelation 10
[57:57] is about
[57:59] he says satan cometh and findeth nothing
[58:01] in me the absence of anything
[58:04] contrary
[58:06] anything
[58:07] contrary to the word of god no fear
[58:11] no anxiety
[58:13] no weaknesses no doubts of the mind he
[58:16] found in jesus a man fully committed to
[58:21] the father and this time he comes in
[58:24] revelation 10 to accomplish the same
[58:28] thing in you and i want you to catch
[58:30] this before you leave here
[58:35] i can't emphasize that strong enough i'm
[58:38] here to tell you we are going home in
[58:40] victory the bride isn't going to stumble
[58:43] over the finish line she's marching to
[58:45] the step of the gospel
[58:47] she has complete victories say i don't
[58:49] feel like i got victory it's coming
[58:52] he's doing more in you than you're aware
[58:54] of
[58:56] and he'll do whatever's necessary to get
[58:58] you there
[59:02] that's very soon
[59:04] he's working it out in us now
[59:08] he's doing more in you
[59:10] let me give you some courage he's doing
[59:11] more in your kids than you're aware of
[59:14] he's doing more in your loved ones than
[59:16] you're aware of he's doing more in this
[59:18] church than you're aware of
[59:20] god is busy
[59:21] hallelujah oh my
[59:24] you remember i said that friends you
[59:26] remember i said that
[59:28] that he has come in this coming
[59:31] when when satan came to him he found
[59:33] nothing in him no fear no anxiety no
[59:34] failures no weaknesses no nothing he was
[59:36] a man fully surrendered to the will of
[59:39] the father and i'm here to tell you
[59:41] before the when he comes as mrs jesus
[59:43] christ he's coming to accomplish that
[59:45] same thing in you
[59:48] hallelujah
[59:50] the falling apart of the world is
[59:52] setting us
[59:53] in the mindset that we need to have i
[59:56] can tell you right now events are
[59:57] happening in the world as she nears her
[59:59] end that will require this of us
[1:00:04] it's going to require a faith brother
[1:00:06] branham talks about that that that it
[1:00:09] where it's going to be necessary and i i
[1:00:11] am becoming
[1:00:12] more and more convinced of this as we go
[1:00:16] along and i see the condition of the
[1:00:18] world and
[1:00:19] i'm not here tonight to preach on world
[1:00:21] events but they're shaking
[1:00:23] the troublesome times are here
[1:00:26] filling men's hearts with fear
[1:00:28] oh my scriptural prophecy is too clear
[1:00:31] on this point folks
[1:00:34] brother branham was too clear i got the
[1:00:36] number of quotes i'm going to read for
[1:00:37] you tonight
[1:00:38] but the prophet
[1:00:40] goes back to the scriptures over and
[1:00:41] over and over again proving this point
[1:00:44] that that even in his day he could see
[1:00:46] things coming he he talks about a faith
[1:00:49] that we're going to need a perfect faith
[1:00:50] why is he preaching it he said because
[1:00:52] you're going to need it
[1:00:54] he could see it coming see and so so we
[1:00:57] find here let me let me read you just a
[1:00:59] few of his statements here now i'll
[1:01:01] interchange with comments as i go
[1:01:04] i've got these chronological 1956 now
[1:01:07] this is the last year of mercy for
[1:01:09] america
[1:01:11] brother branham said he sees the
[1:01:13] condition that pentecost has come to
[1:01:16] 50 years after their
[1:01:18] great
[1:01:19] when the revival hit on azusa
[1:01:21] and and and they i mean they they
[1:01:25] literally called the fire department out
[1:01:27] because people witnesses on the street
[1:01:29] said the building is engulfed in flames
[1:01:33] i've read that newspaper article that's
[1:01:35] a true story
[1:01:36] that's a true story they thought that
[1:01:38] building witnesses on the street said my
[1:01:40] goodness called the fire department they
[1:01:41] thought it was engulfed
[1:01:44] when they got there it was on fire all
[1:01:45] right
[1:01:46] not that kind of fire
[1:01:49] but what they had become in 50 years
[1:01:54] brother branham warned them even during
[1:01:56] these times he said if pentecost stays
[1:01:58] on this trajectory that's not the word
[1:02:00] he used but
[1:02:01] i think he said if she keeps going the
[1:02:03] way she's going he said in another 50
[1:02:06] years she'll be worse than the catholic
[1:02:08] church
[1:02:10] and i i have to say sometimes when i
[1:02:12] look at some of the things
[1:02:14] uh
[1:02:14] maybe on youtube that are represented as
[1:02:16] christianity and supposed to be singing
[1:02:18] and charismatic movements and
[1:02:19] pentecostal i'm here to tell you give me
[1:02:21] a catholic mass any day of the week
[1:02:24] at least i don't feel like vomiting
[1:02:27] for what they pass off as christianity
[1:02:29] it is vulgar it is horrible it is it is
[1:02:33] almost indescribably
[1:02:35] wicked to me
[1:02:37] and and at least you you get a good
[1:02:39] catholic at least they're humble and
[1:02:41] they're solemn and they come into the
[1:02:43] presence of god i i'm not here at let me
[1:02:45] get going on that amen buddy but we've
[1:02:48] seen it come to pass
[1:02:51] brother branham is warning them now at
[1:02:53] their jubilee this is 1956 50-year
[1:02:56] jubilee for them they had asked him to
[1:02:58] hold a series of meetings here's one of
[1:02:59] his sermons
[1:03:01] what we need is not pentecost
[1:03:04] but the god of pentecost
[1:03:07] you're coming to the jordan men and
[1:03:09] women see now that has a broad
[1:03:12] application i mean we're coming to the
[1:03:14] jordan in death all of us
[1:03:15] all of us are going to meet it except
[1:03:17] those who are alive and remain at the
[1:03:18] moment we're changed
[1:03:20] there's also brother branham said i he
[1:03:22] when he saw looking between the second
[1:03:24] and third pool and he saw himself coming
[1:03:27] toward the jordan and he said i realized
[1:03:28] i was two-thirds of the way and so now
[1:03:30] the third pole was the most important
[1:03:32] part because that was the mamba
[1:03:35] that one strike he said one strike would
[1:03:37] kill a man and it tried to get to
[1:03:40] brother branham but it couldn't get him
[1:03:41] and he had power over it had power to
[1:03:44] bind it i bind you in the name of jesus
[1:03:46] christ and he said it rolled up and
[1:03:47] turned crystal and he said the
[1:03:50] the the voice said you have power to
[1:03:52] lose him also and he said well let me
[1:03:54] test it i lose you in the name of jesus
[1:03:55] christ and immediately the smoke the
[1:03:57] blue smoke came back in it it reanimated
[1:04:00] again and quickly brother branham said
[1:04:01] quickly i said i bind you in the name of
[1:04:03] jesus christ
[1:04:06] i'm glad he left it bound that's the
[1:04:07] last thing on tape
[1:04:09] the last thing on tape a prophet bound
[1:04:11] him so don't worry
[1:04:12] hallelujah you're believing a message
[1:04:14] that has authority over
[1:04:17] the over the great mamba you have
[1:04:19] authority and the time of the third pull
[1:04:22] you have authority now that we're about
[1:04:24] to cross over
[1:04:29] he says you're coming to jordan men and
[1:04:31] women each one of you is coming down to
[1:04:33] the jordan this is at the 50-year
[1:04:34] jubilee and this is the last year
[1:04:36] america will ever have mercy as a nation
[1:04:41] he says you're coming down to the jordan
[1:04:42] i don't know when that may be it may be
[1:04:45] before daylight for some of us but i
[1:04:47] tell you
[1:04:48] there's coming a time
[1:04:50] that when you're going to need more than
[1:04:53] an old moth eaten robe of some church
[1:04:56] you're there's coming a time you're
[1:04:58] going to need the god that set that
[1:05:01] church of fire in its early days
[1:05:05] here's a prophet looking forward in time
[1:05:08] could see by the bible what was
[1:05:10] happening and he knew he knew and he
[1:05:13] pleaded with them and warned them if you
[1:05:15] keep sowing to denominationalism when
[1:05:17] the latter rain comes that's all the
[1:05:19] harvest you'll have you can only reap
[1:05:21] what you've sown and that's why a
[1:05:23] prophet
[1:05:24] showed a field with the word of god and
[1:05:26] so when the mighty god opened the seals
[1:05:29] then the latter rain began to bring
[1:05:30] forth believers it began to bring forth
[1:05:33] miss his jesus christ why because that's
[1:05:36] the seed that was sown
[1:05:38] he sowed for the word they sowed for
[1:05:41] denominations
[1:05:44] he says you're going to need there's
[1:05:45] coming a time
[1:05:47] you're going to have to have the vision
[1:05:49] that they had in the early days that
[1:05:51] wore this
[1:05:52] the new school has come in and the holes
[1:05:54] has been eaten in and the doubts and
[1:05:55] superstitions and theologies and things
[1:05:58] till the thing is no good at all
[1:05:59] call for the god of pentecost that's
[1:06:02] what we need today i'd like to say to
[1:06:04] bethel tabernacle call for the god of
[1:06:06] pentecost because that day he's talking
[1:06:09] about this day
[1:06:11] it's this day you're here you're living
[1:06:14] in this quote
[1:06:19] says the servant of god has to call on
[1:06:21] god
[1:06:23] he has to depend on god not his church
[1:06:26] not his robe
[1:06:27] he has to depend on god god's asking him
[1:06:31] to do the impossible in order to do the
[1:06:34] impossible you've got to call on god for
[1:06:37] power of god to perform the impossible
[1:06:40] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:06:42] we are living in the hour of
[1:06:44] impossibility
[1:06:46] you're living in an impossible day with
[1:06:48] darkness over the whole earth gross
[1:06:50] darkness on the minds of people
[1:06:52] the church no longer the mouthpiece
[1:06:55] satan's eden
[1:06:57] he's the god of this evil age he
[1:06:59] controls the pulpits the educational
[1:07:01] centers all the politics all the courts
[1:07:03] he controls society he controls all the
[1:07:06] entertainment you're living in a day
[1:07:08] when it's quite impossible for you to be
[1:07:10] an overcomer but revelation 10 came and
[1:07:14] a mighty angel came and the lamb opened
[1:07:17] the lamb's book of life
[1:07:24] he moves on in 1962 wisdom versus faith
[1:07:27] now what are we doing
[1:07:29] what are we trying to do this morning
[1:07:31] follow what the lord said brother
[1:07:33] branham
[1:07:34] he says lay up food brother batman had
[1:07:37] that
[1:07:38] that vision where
[1:07:39] you know he he's he's got a like a like
[1:07:42] a seller and he said i was just ordering
[1:07:44] said you need to store up food for the
[1:07:46] people he said i was just ordering
[1:07:48] radishes and and all kinds of vegetables
[1:07:50] and piling them in there and just piling
[1:07:52] this cellar full and he and so now he
[1:07:55] comes here later and in this sermon
[1:07:57] catch it wisdom versus faith
[1:08:00] man's wisdom
[1:08:01] versus faith see
[1:08:04] now what are we doing trying to do this
[1:08:05] morning follow what the lord said lay up
[1:08:08] food you're going to need it
[1:08:12] amen
[1:08:13] one of these days
[1:08:17] you think the prophet didn't think it
[1:08:18] was good for that day of course he did
[1:08:20] but under inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:08:22] you've got a prophet saying
[1:08:24] we're storing up food you're going to
[1:08:26] need it one of these days
[1:08:29] he moves on to 63 in conferences
[1:08:34] he says oh brother i wish i had a little
[1:08:36] more time the time is coming catch it
[1:08:38] now this is a prophet prophet speaking
[1:08:41] the time is coming
[1:08:45] when you're either going to put your
[1:08:46] organization
[1:08:48] into the world council of churches
[1:08:51] and if you do that you take the image of
[1:08:53] the beast
[1:08:55] uh
[1:08:56] if you do that you take the image of the
[1:08:58] beast because you've got a power
[1:09:00] watch this now listen this language
[1:09:02] because you've got a power
[1:09:04] just like it was in rome
[1:09:07] see remember we showed you
[1:09:10] in in revelation 10 i think verse
[1:09:14] 3
[1:09:15] where he comes down and he puts one foot
[1:09:17] on the land and one foot on the seat
[1:09:19] raises his hand and swears by him that
[1:09:21] liveth forever the delay is over i'm not
[1:09:24] holding back the full word anymore i'm
[1:09:26] going to release it all
[1:09:27] say call for my queen to stand by my
[1:09:29] side
[1:09:30] and we showed you that the foot on the
[1:09:32] land and the sea meant showed that that
[1:09:34] christ in his church whether it was the
[1:09:37] old rome that came up out of the sea in
[1:09:39] the book of revelation or whether it was
[1:09:41] the or whether it was a repackaged rome
[1:09:44] that came up out of the land in
[1:09:45] revelation 13 it was all the same
[1:09:47] antichrist spirit it was old roman new
[1:09:50] rome
[1:09:51] but they're under our feet
[1:09:54] revelation 10 put rome under your feet
[1:10:00] amen
[1:10:01] and so he says
[1:10:03] so he says see
[1:10:05] you're going to have to take and join
[1:10:08] this world council of churches and when
[1:10:09] you do that you take the image you're
[1:10:11] going to get the mark of the beast he's
[1:10:12] referring to and he says and if you
[1:10:13] don't do it
[1:10:16] you'll be an individual independent
[1:10:17] church and when you do the image of the
[1:10:20] beast is going to close your doors and
[1:10:23] you're going to be forbidden and then
[1:10:25] you're going to need a conference
[1:10:28] it's in this message conferences with
[1:10:30] god i love that statement out of
[1:10:32] conferences i say it often times you
[1:10:33] probably if you've ever been here and
[1:10:35] had brother jason come down to pray for
[1:10:37] you you probably hear me because i want
[1:10:40] you to hear
[1:10:41] a prophet's words to that a prophet said
[1:10:44] as a son and daughter of god
[1:10:46] you have a right
[1:10:48] to a conference with god
[1:10:51] it is your inalienable right that means
[1:10:55] you don't need to ask anybody's
[1:10:56] permission and nobody can take it from
[1:10:59] you
[1:11:01] the devil has no authority to stop it
[1:11:03] you have a divine right when you get in
[1:11:06] trouble you have a divine right to have
[1:11:09] a conference with god
[1:11:11] and god will attend
[1:11:13] think about that tonight think of the
[1:11:15] privilege that you're enjoying you have
[1:11:17] a right to call jesus on the scene
[1:11:20] and because you're his child and you're
[1:11:22] exercising your rights that he gave you
[1:11:24] it's like in the bible that he gives you
[1:11:26] a faith and then turns around and gives
[1:11:28] you a blessing for having the faith he
[1:11:30] gave you
[1:11:31] oh my
[1:11:33] my
[1:11:35] so he says when all of this happens
[1:11:38] they'll close your doors you're going to
[1:11:39] be forbidden and then you're going to
[1:11:41] need a conference with god now
[1:11:43] all right so i'm not i'm not trying to
[1:11:46] suggest
[1:11:47] that we're going to have the the thing
[1:11:50] the foolish virgin has in the
[1:11:51] tribulation period we miss that brother
[1:11:53] brown is very clear the bride doesn't go
[1:11:54] into the tribulation period
[1:11:56] but but but listen
[1:11:58] it doesn't it's not going to have to
[1:12:00] wait to the tribulation period the
[1:12:02] government that we currently have even
[1:12:05] with our current constitution here in
[1:12:07] all through north america have already
[1:12:09] been closing churches
[1:12:12] and they've been arresting pastors who
[1:12:14] defy that order this isn't ah this isn't
[1:12:17] conspiracy theory it's in the headlines
[1:12:21] be glad you live in south carolina we do
[1:12:22] things a little different here

[1:12:27] does come here because
[1:12:29] amen we do things a little different

[1:12:36] battles took place in the revolutionary
[1:12:39] war in south carolina than any other
[1:12:40] colony
[1:12:42] that's right amen we had the swamp fox
[1:12:45] and he really gave them grief and so
[1:12:47] amen so we we we tend to fight a lot
[1:12:50] [Laughter]

[1:14:35] this there'll be five behind this one
[1:14:37] and ten behind that one
[1:14:40] and you've seen it i didn't need to be a
[1:14:42] prophet to say that that i just now you
[1:14:44] can see prophecy and knew it would have
[1:14:46] to be that way
[1:14:49] now he moves on
[1:14:51] later in 63 near the end of the year he

[1:15:14] amen
[1:15:18] so he says he he that is in you you want
[1:15:20] him to be in you
[1:15:22] he says about this message this morning
[1:15:24] now i want everyone to thoroughly
[1:15:26] understand
[1:15:28] now i am trusting to god
[1:15:30] now oh i know i know why i have this
[1:15:32] quote here
[1:15:33] this this is the evening sermon
[1:15:36] behind
[1:15:38] the morning sermon of souls in prison
[1:15:40] now amen
[1:15:43] and when brother branham preached souls
[1:15:45] in prison
[1:15:46] he really
[1:15:47] i'm here to tell you friends it is uh
[1:15:50] you want a tape that moves you that tape
[1:15:52] will put you on on edge
[1:15:55] because because now now granted granted
[1:15:58] granted that brother branham was showing
[1:16:00] in the scripture how that when he takes
[1:16:02] and claims the book mercy's over and
[1:16:03] everything and and over the years over
[1:16:06] 50 years as ministry we've matured to
[1:16:09] understand no mercy still going because
[1:16:11] it's got to go into the last name it's
[1:16:12] called but i'm here to tell you back
[1:16:14] there in in in november the 10th that
[1:16:16] morning
[1:16:18] no one knew that and even brother
[1:16:19] branham himself wasn't sure he said i
[1:16:21] hope it's not over
[1:16:24] see he said but i don't know in the
[1:16:26] scripture he says it looks an awful lot
[1:16:28] like it could be and i mean it was panic
[1:16:31] people were i mean people were pay you
[1:16:33] could hear women and men both screaming
[1:16:36] out
[1:16:38] because it looked even brother bradham
[1:16:39] got quite excited near the end of it but
[1:16:42] he come but now here here here's a
[1:16:44] here's a big point
[1:16:45] that he comes that evening and he that
[1:16:48] is in you and he says now about the
[1:16:49] message this morning now i want everyone
[1:16:52] to thoroughly understand now
[1:16:56] i'm trusting to god
[1:16:58] that it isn't that time meaning when
[1:17:00] mercy's over
[1:17:03] he says see i'm trusting to god that it
[1:17:05] isn't that time but
[1:17:07] the message is truth
[1:17:10] see the message is true it will be some
[1:17:14] time if it isn't that time
[1:17:17] it's coming a time where souls in prison
[1:17:20] is all we'll be preaching to
[1:17:23] that's part of the third poll and that
[1:17:24] comes right and we don't say well how
[1:17:27] will we know when that we might not know
[1:17:30] there might not be anything to uh
[1:17:32] indicate to us but we might be in full
[1:17:36] steam all of our missionary programs
[1:17:38] running still all of our preachers
[1:17:40] preaching still all of our services
[1:17:42] being held still all over the world in
[1:17:44] all kinds of nations and we might go for
[1:17:46] a little while and and suddenly uh maybe
[1:17:49] it might dawn on us that no one is
[1:17:51] coming to it anymore and and and i'm
[1:17:54] gonna tell you something
[1:17:56] that's that's that's the last of the
[1:17:58] last events that was what jesus did
[1:18:00] preach to souls in prison
[1:18:03] just before his resurrection
[1:18:06] and brother branham says well it may not
[1:18:09] be
[1:18:11] now but he says it will be
[1:18:14] sometime if it isn't that time and it
[1:18:16] looks so much like the time till i felt
[1:18:19] like paul of old who said i haven't
[1:18:21] shunned to declare to you the whole
[1:18:23] council see that's why brother branham
[1:18:24] did it you know people could say man
[1:18:26] you're a sensationless william brandon
[1:18:27] all you did was get the people all
[1:18:29] screaming and women passing out and
[1:18:31] people running to the altar and uh
[1:18:34] but brother branham said i i'm felt like
[1:18:36] paul i haven't shunned to declare the
[1:18:38] whole council of god but brother brandon
[1:18:40] made it clear i don't know that it is i
[1:18:42] don't know he kept saying that i don't
[1:18:43] know but it looks like it could be i
[1:18:45] hope it's not he says
[1:18:48] then he comes in 1965
[1:18:51] in the god of this evil age
[1:18:54] and he
[1:18:55] he says here
[1:18:57] he says and then to bring down excuse me
[1:18:59] i'm sorry this court is bothering me i
[1:19:01] don't have a clip for the back part of
[1:19:02] it
[1:19:03] he says and then to bring down to a
[1:19:05] message
[1:19:07] that i think is so vital
[1:19:09] i feel that we ought to
[1:19:12] everyone this is this is 65 that
[1:19:15] everyone
[1:19:16] be comfortable and seated so we can
[1:19:18] listen with our pencils and our papers
[1:19:20] and notes and bible and so forth to take
[1:19:23] down the notes now he's preaching the
[1:19:25] god
[1:19:26] of this evil age
[1:19:30] see
[1:19:31] and he says but this way i thought i
[1:19:34] would go back on the time that we have
[1:19:38] that we're living in
[1:19:40] and try to bring some of these things
[1:19:43] that you're going to meet
[1:19:46] you're going to
[1:19:49] to need them
[1:19:52] so here comes a prophet near the end of
[1:19:54] his ministry and he says now today i got
[1:19:56] an important topic the god of this evil
[1:19:58] age he's got to warn the church
[1:20:00] he's got to warn the true believers that
[1:20:03] that when they when they meet in their
[1:20:06] big crystal cathedrals and they sing
[1:20:09] their songs and they think they're
[1:20:11] worshiping god they're actually not
[1:20:14] they're worshiping satan and they don't
[1:20:17] know it
[1:20:19] now people impugned him terribly for
[1:20:21] that said who do you think you are 7th
[1:20:23] grade hillbilly what kind of kind of
[1:20:25] jurisdiction you know who gave you a
[1:20:27] mandate to declare we're worshiping
[1:20:29] satan well all he was doing was quoting
[1:20:32] the bible
[1:20:35] because when you go back into the old
[1:20:36] testament that's why god built a
[1:20:39] tabernacle and said now there was a time
[1:20:41] there was a time when you just put your
[1:20:44] sacrifices anywhere out there in the
[1:20:45] field or wherever you were he says but
[1:20:47] now you're going to have to bring your
[1:20:48] sacrifice to the door
[1:20:51] and he says and and and the question
[1:20:53] becomes well why do we got to do that
[1:20:55] and god's answer was i'm going to keep
[1:20:58] you from worshiping devils
[1:21:01] the door was christ so if you're going
[1:21:03] to bring your repentance if you're going
[1:21:04] to bring your worship if you're going to
[1:21:06] bring your obedience whatever you're
[1:21:07] going to bring your your your your
[1:21:10] loyalty to god your confession to god
[1:21:12] you've got to bring it to the word and
[1:21:15] if you don't bring it to the word you're
[1:21:17] worshiping devils
[1:21:21] now how important is revelation 10.
[1:21:27] see because now the time was over god
[1:21:30] would not wink at that any longer
[1:21:33] now you're back to acts 17. god's not
[1:21:35] going to wink at that any longer he's
[1:21:37] going to require all men to now repent
[1:21:41] you've got to receive the holy ghost
[1:21:43] you've got to receive the bleeding word
[1:21:45] that's the only path to atonement
[1:21:48] see
[1:21:49] and so he says i want to speak about
[1:21:51] this in the day we're living in and try
[1:21:53] to bring some of these things that
[1:21:55] you're going to meet listen friends
[1:21:57] you're meeting them
[1:21:58] we're living in an hour where that
[1:22:00] reality of worshiping the god of this
[1:22:02] evil age is everywhere
[1:22:05] it's rampant all around the world the
[1:22:08] whole world is sodom and gomorrah and
[1:22:10] the days of noah worse
[1:22:13] we're 50 years worse than the days of
[1:22:16] noah 50 years we're a half century
[1:22:18] brother branham was identifying luke 17
[1:22:21] 30
[1:22:22] a half century ago was fulfilled
[1:22:25] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:22:27] that are beating down the door and the
[1:22:29] two messengers have already struck them
[1:22:30] with blindness
[1:22:32] oh abraham's already had a conference
[1:22:34] with melchizedek
[1:22:36] hallelujah fire's about to rain from the
[1:22:39] sky
[1:22:40] and and and as soon as the two
[1:22:42] messengers went off the scene the fire
[1:22:44] fell i'm here to tell you billy graham
[1:22:46] and oral roberts are gone
[1:22:48] [Music]
[1:22:51] this ain't no joke you have arrived we
[1:22:54] are at the moment oh glory hallelujah we
[1:22:57] are at the moment friends the thing
[1:23:00] we've waited for our whole life
[1:23:04] the thing i've believed and looked for
[1:23:05] since a boy
[1:23:07] is upon us
[1:23:11] you're going to meet these things and
[1:23:13] you're going to need them you're going
[1:23:15] to need these things i'm going to teach
[1:23:16] on he said i hope you got your bibles
[1:23:18] and notebooks and pencils he said i'm
[1:23:20] going to preach on this and you're
[1:23:21] you're going to meet these things that
[1:23:22] i'm preaching on you're going to need
[1:23:23] this ammo

[1:25:59] what this coming was sent to accomplish
[1:26:03] [Music]
[1:26:04] to make a divine force flowing
[1:26:08] we have a divine nature by the new birth
[1:26:10] but there's got to be a divine force
[1:26:12] flowing from that divine nature it's a
[1:26:14] it's a it's not a passive it's it's an
[1:26:17] active perfect faith is not passive
[1:26:20] perfect faith is active
[1:26:22] it's the it's a substance
[1:26:24] see
[1:26:26] and so
[1:26:27] it it has to flow through the believer
[1:26:30] and and this is exactly what makes the
[1:26:33] believer

[1:26:52] he's not afraid of how right you are in
[1:26:54] your doctrine what he fears is the life
[1:26:57] what he fears is you'll have that divine
[1:26:59] communion
[1:27:01] that you'll make time in your life and
[1:27:03] your schedule to realize that your main
[1:27:06] purpose in being here as a human being
[1:27:09] as a mortal is to let the divine flow go
[1:27:12] through your divine nature and send out
[1:27:14] divine power hallelujah you'll sense
[1:27:17] every evil he'll walk in and have an
[1:27:19] authority to speak to that thing
[1:27:23] you're able to confront
[1:27:25] and gain victory over any challenge
[1:27:28] satan can muster i want to say it again
[1:27:30] you are you're authorized
[1:27:32] you are empowered hallelujah do you
[1:27:35] believe it that's what revelation 10 did
[1:27:37] when you ate the book you became an
[1:27:39] authorized representative
[1:27:42] with full authority to take every power
[1:27:44] that satan has
[1:27:46] amen
[1:27:49] john in first john we don't i won't you
[1:27:52] don't need to turn i'll just read a
[1:27:53] couple of verses here and scatter them
[1:27:55] around
[1:27:56] don't try to follow me get lost in the
[1:27:57] shuffle but in this fourth chapter of
[1:27:59] first john he tells us how to deal with
[1:28:02] these evil powers with these evil voices
[1:28:04] with these evil influences in our lives
[1:28:07] and our homes and our families and in
[1:28:09] our churches
[1:28:10] evil's everywhere
[1:28:12] but we're not unequipped
[1:28:16] see
[1:28:18] and so
[1:28:19] you know it's it's it's everything
[1:28:23] that contacts our lives
[1:28:25] our homes our families our church our
[1:28:28] job
[1:28:29] our schools
[1:28:31] wherever we go
[1:28:32] evil is lurking you're going to contact
[1:28:35] this world god put you here on purpose
[1:28:39] see he even even said i send you out as
[1:28:42] sheep among wolves
[1:28:44] see
[1:28:45] you're going to face many things but
[1:28:47] don't worry i've overcome the world
[1:28:50] in me you shall have peace
[1:28:52] see
[1:28:53] not as the world gives not that kind of
[1:28:55] peace not because you've got a big bank
[1:28:56] account and plenty of friends on social
[1:28:57] media
[1:28:58] because as soon as you lose that bank
[1:29:00] account those friends you don't have
[1:29:01] peace anymore
[1:29:03] see and and if you're and if you're rich
[1:29:05] and you're you're you're you're number
[1:29:07] one on social media and you got a
[1:29:10] millions of dollars you say i got peace
[1:29:12] i can kind of understand that you ain't
[1:29:13] much to worry about
[1:29:15] you got people they'll do things for you
[1:29:16] got money you burn
[1:29:18] and uh but but but what about when you
[1:29:21] don't have any money and you don't have
[1:29:23] any friends and you're sick and body and
[1:29:25] everything's coming up wrong i'm here to
[1:29:27] tell you that's what the world doesn't
[1:29:29] understand you have a peace that passes
[1:29:31] understanding
[1:29:33] no one can understand how do you stay so
[1:29:36] calm in this kind of a storm
[1:29:38] oh my i'm sheltered safe if they only
[1:29:41] knew i have a divine communion that
[1:29:43] revelation 10 the mighty angel came he
[1:29:46] opened the lamb's book of life and gave
[1:29:48] me shalom
[1:29:53] john says ye are of god little children
[1:29:56] and have overcome them because why
[1:29:59] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:30:03] that is in the world that says a number
[1:30:06] of things there is a he in the world
[1:30:08] there is a he in you and the one in you
[1:30:11] is greater than the one in the world
[1:30:14] that's not a cliche that's that means
[1:30:16] there's a person out there trying to
[1:30:18] take your life trying to poison you
[1:30:20] trying to destroy you but there's
[1:30:22] another he
[1:30:24] there's a greater he that's inside of
[1:30:27] you
[1:30:28] than the he that you confront in the
[1:30:30] world that's why he says try the spirits
[1:30:33] whether they be of god for many false
[1:30:35] prophets are going into the world
[1:30:38] our fellowship with the lord
[1:30:41] fills us with power
[1:30:43] to dethrone
[1:30:46] them try the spirits
[1:30:50] whether they be whether they are of god
[1:30:52] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:30:56] into the world i'm here to tell you our
[1:30:58] fellowship with the lord fills us with
[1:31:01] power to dethrone them
[1:31:05] they want to have influence over your
[1:31:06] kids
[1:31:07] you have power to dethrone that
[1:31:10] you have an ability to identify them no
[1:31:12] matter where they hide and you have an
[1:31:15] ability a god-given privilege to take
[1:31:17] authority over them i'm here to tell you
[1:31:19] some friends that's
[1:31:21] that's a main
[1:31:22] angle of revelation 10. amen do you see
[1:31:26] now why i said let me get preaching
[1:31:28] you'll understand why i took this on a
[1:31:29] wednesday night i'm here to tell you
[1:31:31] this is where we live
[1:31:33] this is what puts spiritual meat on your
[1:31:34] bones just want to give you victory
[1:31:36] because revelation 10 came to give us
[1:31:39] victory
[1:31:41] hallelujah
[1:31:42] and it shows us it shows us how that we
[1:31:46] may live in the world and not be subject
[1:31:49] to fear not be subject to bondage not be
[1:31:52] subject to pain i'm here to tell you the
[1:31:54] devil wants to put you in subjection to
[1:31:56] every one of those
[1:31:58] he'll put every kind of pain and every
[1:32:00] kind of fear and every kind of anxiety
[1:32:02] and every kind of stress and every kind
[1:32:04] of bondage but we've arrived at a time
[1:32:06] and a place where we are here to defeat
[1:32:09] all evil powers and take rulership over
[1:32:12] them you need to take rulership over
[1:32:14] fear rulership over bondage don't be in
[1:32:17] bondage be free
[1:32:20] this is what revelation 10 gave us
[1:32:23] we are we are here eating on the word of
[1:32:26] god to reign by to reign by the life of
[1:32:29] christ and reign in complete victory
[1:32:32] in this way
[1:32:35] we will be
[1:32:37] this is the way friends
[1:32:39] that we are coming to and god is doing
[1:32:42] it
[1:32:43] and and i'm going to tell you something
[1:32:45] we're going to know it
[1:32:47] we're going to know it we're knowing it
[1:32:48] more
[1:32:49] and more
[1:32:50] every day that we are from above and god
[1:32:56] is making that more real and more real
[1:32:59] and more real that you are not from here
[1:33:02] you are from above
[1:33:04] hallelujah you're here for a purpose and
[1:33:07] when that that's to glorify god and when
[1:33:10] that purpose is over i get recalled back
[1:33:13] to where i started
[1:33:15] hallelujah
[1:33:17] we're not here to be subject to the
[1:33:19] world
[1:33:20] we're here to reign over the world we're
[1:33:22] here to bring genesis 1 26 have dominion
[1:33:27] amen
[1:33:28] where do you where where would you
[1:33:30] pl where would you place fear and
[1:33:32] anxiety and bondage and and
[1:33:35] have dominion
[1:33:37] see
[1:33:38] and so so then
[1:33:40] you have to understand the devil's
[1:33:42] tactic his whole thing to give you fear
[1:33:44] and anxiety and pain and bondage is not
[1:33:48] just because he's uh a nasty evil wicked
[1:33:51] person he is all of that but the whole
[1:33:54] that's all to keep you from having
[1:33:57] dominion
[1:33:59] that's that's all it is it's it's his
[1:34:01] only way to stop you from taking part of
[1:34:05] what god has for you in this hour
[1:34:08] see
[1:34:09] and so and so in this revelation 10
[1:34:11] coming of christ
[1:34:13] he has come down in the form of his
[1:34:16] family he's come in the form of the
[1:34:18] living word to literally vanquish and
[1:34:21] overcome all of the power of satan's
[1:34:24] eden do you believe that
[1:34:27] he's come down in the form of the word
[1:34:29] in his family to vanquish the power of
[1:34:33] satan's eden god allowed him to have his
[1:34:36] own eden and then gives his bride and
[1:34:39] authority to have dominion
[1:34:43] over
[1:34:44] him that's what the invisible union
[1:34:47] accomplished the invisible union of the
[1:34:49] heavenly bridegroom
[1:34:51] and the earthly bride has destroyed his
[1:34:55] power over god's family
[1:35:00] the invisible unit next time you hear
[1:35:01] that tape
[1:35:03] make it tomorrow that's a gooden
[1:35:06] the next time you hear the invisible
[1:35:07] union of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:35:09] earthly bride you just remember what
[1:35:11] that he he's brought this about to
[1:35:14] destroy the power of satan
[1:35:18] over god's family
[1:35:21] see
[1:35:22] it actually has a real effect on us it's
[1:35:24] not just it's not just information it's
[1:35:27] not just theology it's not just
[1:35:29] something that's sweet in our mouth it
[1:35:31] can get down in our belly and it's
[1:35:33] bitter because you gotta you gotta you
[1:35:35] gotta make it become something but as i
[1:35:38] said to you last sunday whether it's
[1:35:40] sweet in your mouth or bitter in your
[1:35:42] belly one should not be harder than the
[1:35:44] other or easier than the other if it all
[1:35:47] depends on where your fellowship is with
[1:35:49] christ
[1:35:51] see
[1:35:52] and so we i don't want to get back to
[1:35:54] sunday's material i just start preaching
[1:35:56] all over again but but we find that that
[1:35:59] this power
[1:36:01] even the power of death even the power
[1:36:04] of death
[1:36:06] is under your feet
[1:36:08] the bible proves that to you
[1:36:10] i mean
[1:36:13] could satan do you think he'll have any
[1:36:16] do you think satan will have any chance
[1:36:19] to convince you
[1:36:21] that he has power over your body when
[1:36:24] you get a body change
[1:36:26] you'd think he wouldn't stop that if he
[1:36:28] could stop if he had power over your
[1:36:30] body
[1:36:31] i promise you
[1:36:32] that's the one he'd let you have the one
[1:36:34] most wonderful life in the world he can
[1:36:35] stop that one
[1:36:37] the very fact that we which are alive
[1:36:40] and remain shall be changed we're going
[1:36:41] to be caught up in a moment and a
[1:36:43] twinkling of an eye
[1:36:45] that proves that god has given us power
[1:36:49] over our bodies even over death itself
[1:36:53] because that power that was released by
[1:36:56] the opening of the seventh seal is here
[1:36:58] now it came to translate our bodies
[1:37:02] came to changes the only way satan
[1:37:04] listen don't be afraid of him they only
[1:37:06] say people have died the only way satan
[1:37:08] can remove any one of god's children
[1:37:11] from the earth is with god's permission
[1:37:14] and it's either their time was up or god
[1:37:16] has some other sovereign purpose in it
[1:37:18] but satan until god is finished with you
[1:37:20] you're immortal
[1:37:23] now if he can't kill you he sure can't
[1:37:25] stop you why do you let him convince you
[1:37:27] he can
[1:37:28] i'm here to tell you the mighty angel
[1:37:30] came with an open book to tell you he
[1:37:32] can't stop you
[1:37:34] if you'll take it and have fellowship
[1:37:36] and enter into that divine communion
[1:37:38] with god you'll have more power than
[1:37:40] satan has ever imagined possible
[1:37:44] not power for the sake of power
[1:37:46] it's humility that's where real power is
[1:37:49] see
[1:37:51] what will hinder us brother jason this
[1:37:53] is great i love it i'm sold i'll take
[1:37:55] 10.
[1:37:59] what's the catch is there anything that
[1:38:00] can hinder it
[1:38:03] our human nature will
[1:38:06] if you let it
[1:38:08] there you go
[1:38:09] your human nature will if you let it
[1:38:13] god's work in us will be hindered when
[1:38:16] the human will is not wholly surrendered
[1:38:21] it might get a little quiet now
[1:38:24] see
[1:38:25] now i'm really coming down to my
[1:38:26] wednesday night crocs
[1:38:28] this this this is the burden
[1:38:31] and can i say this this is not the
[1:38:34] burden on my heart just for you y'all
[1:38:36] just y'all just gathered here helping me
[1:38:39] eat the meal god has set before me
[1:38:43] because this is this is a meal god set
[1:38:45] before me
[1:38:46] and i just said lord
[1:38:48] you know
[1:38:49] we need the god of elijah
[1:38:51] we need the god of pentecost we we we
[1:38:54] see the world falling apart we see all
[1:38:56] of these things we see pandemics we see
[1:38:58] fear we see anxiety we see evil we see
[1:39:01] wickedness everywhere and our our young
[1:39:03] people are battling it 50 times harder
[1:39:05] than we ever had it
[1:39:07] what's the answer lord and the lord
[1:39:08] begin to say there's power
[1:39:11] i brought power with me i brought an
[1:39:13] open book i opened the lamb's book of
[1:39:15] life there's not a more potent book in
[1:39:18] existence
[1:39:19] i brought the mighty god i unveiled him
[1:39:24] how much more power do you want what
[1:39:26] more can he do
[1:39:27] as brother brooks sings what more can he
[1:39:30] do
[1:39:31] see
[1:39:32] but what happens then why isn't it
[1:39:34] working because too often times
[1:39:37] god's work gets hindered
[1:39:39] when our human will is not wholly
[1:39:41] surrendered
[1:39:42] when there's some mixture of faith and
[1:39:44] doubt and
[1:39:45] when there's a listen friends when
[1:39:47] there's a division in your own heart
[1:39:50] because you're you're condemned over
[1:39:51] your lifestyle
[1:39:54] now i spent the whole
[1:39:56] three quarters of this sermon
[1:39:58] pumping you up on what's available now
[1:40:00] let me tell you how to how to not make
[1:40:03] it fail
[1:40:05] because no one can make it fail listen
[1:40:08] satan can't make it fail
[1:40:11] only you can
[1:40:15] satan has no authority to make god's
[1:40:17] power fail in your life that's you doing
[1:40:20] that
[1:40:20] see it's it's it's however much power i
[1:40:24] proved that to you on sunday there in
[1:40:26] ephesians 3
[1:40:28] but it's it's all about the level of
[1:40:30] fellowship that we have paul remember
[1:40:32] those dynamic words that paul used about
[1:40:35] the whole fullness of god and i wish for
[1:40:37] you to have all this abundantly above
[1:40:39] and paul said according according as it
[1:40:42] works in you
[1:40:43] see according to the level of fellowship
[1:40:46] in your life there's the rub
[1:40:48] according to the sincerity of our heart
[1:40:51] you know before the lord listen friends
[1:40:53] i've already told you you're just
[1:40:54] helping me eat my eat my food tonight
[1:40:59] and there's a mixture there when you're
[1:41:00] when your heart that's why the bible
[1:41:02] says if our heart condemns us not if
[1:41:04] listen if you're questioning the very
[1:41:05] message brought down to us in this hour
[1:41:07] by the mighty angel
[1:41:09] if to you it's just a man-made opinion
[1:41:11] that you can kind of pick and choose
[1:41:12] like a smorgasbord
[1:41:15] i'm here to tell you you're you're
[1:41:17] you know it's it's the person like that
[1:41:20] i feel like the angel who stood to the
[1:41:22] rich young ruler and said thou fool
[1:41:26] you don't even you're so unaware of
[1:41:28] what's actually real
[1:41:31] and people stand and just think oh he
[1:41:32] was just a man willie but yeah it wasn't
[1:41:34] you know half century ago and it was
[1:41:35] just his opinion and he did make
[1:41:36] mistakes thank god because if he hadn't
[1:41:39] i wouldn't think there's any chance for
[1:41:40] me
[1:41:42] i'm thankful he was a man
[1:41:44] i'm thankful he had his ups and downs
[1:41:46] i'm thankful he was a man of like
[1:41:48] passions like the original elijah
[1:41:50] i'm thankful for that it gives me hope
[1:41:52] it gives me a chance
[1:41:54] i say wow if even a prophet who spent
[1:41:56] half of his life in the presence of god
[1:41:58] could still stumble and and make
[1:42:00] mistakes and have to repent and blush in
[1:42:02] the presence of god when he preaches a
[1:42:04] blushing prophet have to walk down in
[1:42:05] front of the church and feel his own sin
[1:42:07] i just say lord there's hope for me
[1:42:09] oh there's hope for me lord god
[1:42:12] hallelujah
[1:42:15] see
[1:42:16] end-time realities
[1:42:19] that we see today are heading off the
[1:42:21] rails
[1:42:23] the world is going inescapably sideways
[1:42:26] there's nobody going to fix it this
[1:42:27] train is crashing
[1:42:30] we know this by reading the events that
[1:42:33] that that happen once the gentile bride
[1:42:36] departs we can read about him in the
[1:42:37] tribulation period things that take
[1:42:39] place when she's gone so the question
[1:42:42] then becomes how deeply are we left to
[1:42:44] wade you know how how deep are we going
[1:42:47] to wade into pre-tribulation events
[1:42:50] before the exodus
[1:42:53] i don't know the answer to that fully
[1:42:56] but i know it's already dropping around
[1:42:59] us
[1:43:00] i know we live in very serious times
[1:43:04] i know that this is an age for you
[1:43:06] teenagers this is a age
[1:43:08] this is an age almost a thousand times
[1:43:11] more critical than when i was your age
[1:43:15] we have arrived at the end of all things
[1:43:16] and this is time because this is we have
[1:43:18] arrived where brother branham said this
[1:43:20] is coming you're gonna get it you're
[1:43:22] gonna need this you better be ready see
[1:43:25] so we so so so the events are taking
[1:43:28] shape then
[1:43:30] that will literally move the bride
[1:43:32] coming of christ into her fullness i
[1:43:34] believe that a hundred percent
[1:43:37] events are happening right now listen
[1:43:40] here's what it's not
[1:43:42] it's not god lost control
[1:43:46] what it is is events that are putting
[1:43:49] you
[1:43:50] and god will use these events to bring
[1:43:52] this whole bride because i've already
[1:43:54] said to you that i firmly believe this
[1:43:56] bride body will come to a complete
[1:43:59] spoken word fullness
[1:44:01] but but let's all be honest sometimes
[1:44:04] we're just a bunch of no good laodiceans
[1:44:07] yes we're believers yes we've had
[1:44:09] experience yes we believe it yes we say
[1:44:12] amen but this old flesh does get in our
[1:44:14] way amen i'm here to tell you crucify it
[1:44:19] because the more you can crucify this
[1:44:21] man the more that the divine life can
[1:44:24] flow through you
[1:44:28] god is allowing these events to bring
[1:44:30] this bride into her fullness
[1:44:36] on that sermon it it was so powerful
[1:44:40] where brother branham preached souls in
[1:44:42] prison
[1:44:45] brother branham says
[1:44:47] he says now you people who might talk
[1:44:49] about people who hear it on tape
[1:44:53] he says that's you that's listening to
[1:44:55] this tape
[1:44:57] i wish you could look at this
[1:44:59] congregation
[1:45:01] at this time
[1:45:03] this is from yesteryear
[1:45:06] it's a prophet you you're you're hearing
[1:45:09] off of a tape
[1:45:10] i'm reading you statements taken off of
[1:45:12] magnetic tape and i'm taking you back to
[1:45:15] 1963.
[1:45:18] and a prophet
[1:45:19] has captivated an audience an alarm
[1:45:22] and he himself is alarmed because he
[1:45:25] looks at the bible and he sees the lamb
[1:45:27] come forward and take the book and he
[1:45:28] knows the the mercy seat that the that
[1:45:31] the that the sanctuary goes smokey
[1:45:34] he knows there's no more blood on the
[1:45:36] altar when that happens and he knows
[1:45:37] he's got an open book it's like two and
[1:45:39] two together wow i know i got an open
[1:45:40] book but i know when he opens the book
[1:45:42] and takes it mercy's over so is mercy
[1:45:44] over
[1:45:47] are we already preaching is the third
[1:45:50] pole preaching to souls in prison
[1:45:52] already in full swing
[1:45:55] he says i wish you could look at this
[1:45:56] congregation at this time but remember
[1:45:59] at this time he says
[1:46:01] he talks about noah
[1:46:03] when the judgment started coming noah
[1:46:05] was in the ark the bride is sealed in
[1:46:06] with christ the last member has been
[1:46:08] redeemed see watch the sixth seal has
[1:46:11] produced itself the seventh seal brings
[1:46:12] him back to the earth the lamb come and
[1:46:14] took the book out of the right hand and
[1:46:16] sat down and claimed what he owned what
[1:46:18] he had to redeem that's right it's
[1:46:19] always been that third pull
[1:46:22] see he says it may be later than we
[1:46:25] think yes
[1:46:27] now remember
[1:46:29] he comes the net that evening and says
[1:46:30] now if it's not it is coming
[1:46:33] listen friends
[1:46:35] this is happening
[1:46:37] that we're not waiting for these these
[1:46:39] things to start happening they've
[1:46:41] already been happening apace
[1:46:44] and the only thing that's happening now
[1:46:45] is the last winding of the clock the
[1:46:47] last few ticks
[1:46:50] see those last names to be called
[1:46:55] so so mercy is over outside of the open
[1:46:58] book
[1:46:59] there's no redemption outside of it
[1:47:02] people can find salvation from
[1:47:03] destruction
[1:47:04] but they can't find redemption outside
[1:47:06] of the open book i mean if if if people
[1:47:09] could find it in their own in their
[1:47:11] church systems why did the lamb need to
[1:47:12] open the book
[1:47:14] it's the lamb's book of life
[1:47:17] see
[1:47:19] he says it may be later than we think
[1:47:21] now listen i'm gonna close in 10 minutes
[1:47:23] i still got you
[1:47:27] he says don't
[1:47:29] he says
[1:47:30] uh it may be later than we think it'll
[1:47:32] catch you
[1:47:34] don't go any further he's pleading with
[1:47:35] people don't go any further don't do it
[1:47:38] people if you've always believed me as
[1:47:39] god's servant take my word this morning
[1:47:41] if you ever did it
[1:47:43] it might already be too late
[1:47:46] so much scripture shows it that way now
[1:47:48] remember i don't say that it is i don't
[1:47:50] know but look
[1:47:53] he goes on down he says i've cut out
[1:47:54] about 10 pages here that i was afraid to
[1:47:56] tell you
[1:47:58] he said
[1:47:59] you know he he talks about going you
[1:48:01] know to
[1:48:02] to charlie and nellie's and he said to
[1:48:04] them i can't even i can't say this
[1:48:06] charlie i can't say that he said it's
[1:48:08] too frightening
[1:48:10] he comes he says people will laugh at
[1:48:12] this message it's all right
[1:48:15] it'll be past turning back one of these
[1:48:17] days
[1:48:20] it'll be past turning back one of these
[1:48:21] days now listen listen carefully

[1:51:13] brother junior jackson
[1:51:15] jumps to his feet and begins to prophesy

[1:51:19] identified by the brother branham with a
[1:51:21] gift of prophecy like that he begins to
[1:51:23] prophesy an unknown tongue
[1:51:25] and right away confirming the message
[1:51:28] confirming this is the hour this is the
[1:51:29] time what you've heard today is real
[1:51:33] i remember
[1:51:35] as a young boy sitting
[1:51:37] in a in a living room in hickory north
[1:51:39] carolina
[1:51:40] and we were having a little family altar
[1:51:42] and
[1:51:43] dad and mom played this very sermon i
[1:51:45] remember it like it was yesterday
[1:51:49] and as that and as as that begin to roll
[1:51:52] and i i'm sitting listening today and i
[1:51:54] can hear those women crying out men
[1:51:56] shouting and screaming and people in a
[1:51:58] commotion and brother branham said
[1:52:00] nobody's even sitting down everybody's
[1:52:01] standing up everybody's piling around
[1:52:03] the altar i was in a church i i remember
[1:52:06] i remember in in 1990 when the gulf war
[1:52:08] started i was in a church in newton
[1:52:10] north carolina and and they come out and
[1:52:12] we all knew there was a bunch of things
[1:52:14] going on in the middle east and and
[1:52:16] pastor miller comes out and he didn't
[1:52:18] say it at the beginning because he knew
[1:52:19] what would happen and he was exactly
[1:52:21] right and he waited till he finished his
[1:52:23] sermon very good sermon called invasion
[1:52:25] of the usa took brother branson's sermon
[1:52:27] and and preached from that invasion of
[1:52:28] the usa and that brother branham's whole
[1:52:30] point was don't be waiting for an
[1:52:32] invasion of the usa she's already been
[1:52:33] invaded
[1:52:34] hollywood has already invaded her demon
[1:52:36] powers has already invaded her
[1:52:39] america's long been under control she
[1:52:42] forfeited her rights in 1956
[1:52:46] and he said now
[1:52:48] i remember i was sitting right about
[1:52:50] where chris is now and brother miller
[1:52:52] just comes down off the platform he says
[1:52:53] now i need to let everybody know i'm
[1:52:54] done with my sermon and he and he says
[1:52:57] he says i mean i need to tell you all uh
[1:53:00] the the war has started they've dropped
[1:53:01] the bomb and and he tells a couple
[1:53:04] people like brother tony your mother
[1:53:06] needs you to call her right away so
[1:53:07] so-and-so your husband said quickly
[1:53:09] leave come home and people like
[1:53:11] what what oh my goodness it's war in the
[1:53:13] middle east is this all leading to
[1:53:15] armageddon and oh my goodness teenagers
[1:53:17] that you couldn't have drugged to the
[1:53:19] altar with wild horses were running
[1:53:22] falling on the altar screaming and
[1:53:24] crying god have mercy thought maybe it

[1:53:41] came to declare there was nothing left
[1:53:43] after after the bride is the is the
[1:53:45] measurable perfection in a chapter 11
[1:53:47] verse 1 it's the last image you see of
[1:53:49] her and then they don't measure the
[1:53:51] outside court because that's left to the
[1:53:52] gentiles they're going into the
[1:53:53] tribulation the eagle anointing lifts up
[1:53:56] flies east picks up moses and elijah
[1:53:58] goes for the 144 thousand and a bride is
[1:54:00] seated on a table thousands of miles

[1:54:16] he's saying these same words and as i'm
[1:54:18] reliving it like i'm back in that living

[1:54:33] alarm and the anointing and and
[1:54:36] and and and sister gene

[2:02:34] just just go tomorrow and just keep
[2:02:37] saying this to yourself
[2:02:39] he opened
[2:02:40] the lamb's book of life
[2:02:44] he opened the lamb's book of life
[2:02:48] no one could open it no one was worthy
[2:02:50] to even look at it
[2:02:54] not even his family we were all born in
[2:02:56] sin
[2:02:58] think about what you're entitled to
[2:02:59] today
[2:03:01] no you you know we're talking about this
[2:03:03] today brother paul and i what what was
[2:03:05] that book what was the opening of that
[2:03:07] book it was the mighty god unveiled
[2:03:08] brother ram said he opened those seals
[2:03:10] that broke him off of himself
[2:03:12] he's christ
[2:03:14] he was god unbridled
[2:03:16] no one was worthy to look at that
[2:03:19] no one is to this moment except those
[2:03:22] who are redeemed by the lamb
[2:03:24] you have a privilege tonight i don't
[2:03:27] care what you how much of a failure you
[2:03:29] might feel you might feel as dry as us
[2:03:31] as a stick
[2:03:33] but just remember brother jason reminded
[2:03:35] you
[2:03:36] you've been given the privilege
[2:03:38] to gaze
[2:03:39] into the lamb's book of life
[2:03:42] the mighty god unveiled before us
[2:03:45] that's that's that's why i'm a believer
[2:03:48] that's why i believe this message
[2:03:50] because i see it has that ability
[2:03:53] in our lives

[2:04:26] lord

[2:04:31] could claim to be worthy of anything
[2:04:34] lord if it's based on our worthiness we

[2:04:38] long time ago

[2:05:15] lifestyle and the things i'm involved

[2:05:29] it couldn't have a more tragic story a
[2:05:32] son or daughter of god missing out on

[2:05:46] of my voice don't let it be me don't let

[2:10:55] the whole thing about they can't even
[2:10:56] get it in to look at it for two weeks
[2:10:58] and it could be a serious issue

[2:11:02] still it's a terrible thing to have to
[2:11:04] go through because then what are they
[2:11:06] going to do and so let's pray for that
[2:11:08] car let's pray the lord to heal it amen
