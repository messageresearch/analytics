[0:00] you'll find that bethseda we were there
[0:02] is near the Sea of Galilee this is where
[0:06] it's at and so you have the Sea of
[0:09] Galilee which is where bethseda is this
[0:12] is where he feeds 5,000 then he's going
[0:15] to feed 4,000 and where he feeds the
[0:18] 4,000 is near the region of the
[0:22] gisin gism remember that and so the
[0:25] first
[0:27] location is Betha it's Jewish it's a
[0:31] Jewish City it's to the
[0:34] Jews
[0:35] right so the first here's 5,000 he feeds
[0:39] the first location the numbers for that
[0:43] first location the people who he feeds
[0:46] them who breaks the fishes and the
[0:47] loaves is Jewish it's a Jewish Community
[0:50] the second is the gines and the gines
[0:53] are
[0:54] Gentiles so you catching it the first
[0:57] time he feeds the Jews the second time
[0:59] he feeds the Gentiles you follow those
[1:01] twos remember only two groups of people
[1:04] only two ways God looks at everything
[1:06] and so he feeds 5,000 here 4,000 here
[1:09] one's to the Jews one's to the Gentiles
[1:12] right also the numbers are a perfect
[1:15] match the feeding of 5,000 is
[1:19] representative of the Jews Five
[1:22] Loaves
[1:24] 5,000 representing what the old Covenant
[1:27] the Torah what is five the first Five
[1:30] Books of Moses is the
[1:32] Torah so it's it's a representation that
[1:35] this feeding or this opening or
[1:38] understanding is coming to the Jews it's
[1:40] going to be 5,000 it's going to be in a
[1:42] Jewish City it's going to represent the
[1:44] first five books of Moses the Torah and
[1:48] guess how many baskets they end up
[1:51] with
[1:54] 12 wow brother
[1:56] Enoch someone say wow 12
[2:00] you think God does any of this by
[2:01] accident he doesn't 12 tribes five books
[2:05] Five Loaves representing 12 then brother
[2:08] Matt surely the 4,000 couldn't add up
[2:10] either well the the 4,000 represents the
[2:14] Gentiles because there's how many loaves
[2:16] are
[2:18] used hello we just read it there's seven
[2:22] loaves seven Church ages seven Church
[2:25] age Messengers the fullness of the
[2:27] Gentiles there's seven loads and guess
[2:30] how many baskets they end up
[2:33] with
[2:35] seven it's a perfect representation of
[2:39] the Gentile dispensation and the Jewish
[2:41] dis dispensation because right now this
[2:44] is what's about you say brother Matt
[2:45] what do you saying I'm saying that God
[2:46] has a
[2:47] language and if you just read the Bible
[2:50] and gloss over it and you just you'll
[2:52] get an understanding from it but brother
[2:53] Brandon says above all else pray for
[2:56] Revelation but why brother mat because
[2:58] Revelation is God God's language he
[3:02] doesn't just you say can he use
[3:04] knowledge he does can he speak to me
[3:07] through through just learning the Bible
[3:08] by hearing the Bible studies all of
[3:10] that's important friends but I just want
[3:12] to tell you brother Brandon would say it
[3:13] this way it it's not going to take
[3:16] normal just brother my brother came to
[3:19] brother Bram said oh brother brandham
[3:20] the only way I can only way to
[3:22] understand God is to you got to study
[3:24] the Greek and study the Hebrew and study
[3:26] the languages and and and prophet of God
[3:28] says that's all right but let me tell
[3:30] you what that's what that's produced
[3:32] it's just produced seminaries and
[3:34] churches and churches churches and
[3:36] Peoples Peoples but there there would
[3:38] come something greater than a human
[3:40] dialect or understanding because God was
[3:43] going to call a people and that those
[3:46] people would understand the word or the
[3:48] mystery of the word not through
[3:52] understanding or reasoning or rational
[3:54] thought but through Revelation can you
[3:57] say Amen are you glad for it Lord we
[3:59] give you thanks this morning Father for
[4:02] your word lord it's our portion as David
[4:05] said I pray God that you would take
[4:08] these things that I said Lord and God
[4:10] may you add to it God may you give Grace
[4:13] unto the hearer Lord Jesus may it
[4:15] produce something in our life we ask
[4:17] bless the service the worship Lord God
[4:19] that'll go forward from here both in
[4:21] singing and in the preaching of the word

[48:34] right into
[48:35] it verse one Exodus 12 verse one I think
[48:40] I sent back that we would read down
[48:43] through verse 13 I
[48:46] believe all right verse
[48:48] one and the Lord spake unto Moses and
[48:52] Aaron uh in the land of Egypt saying
[48:55] this month shall be unto you
[48:57] the beginning of month so this would be
[48:59] on their calendar abib their first month
[49:02] or Nissan which would correspond to our
[49:05] March or April it shall be the first
[49:07] month of the year to you speak ye unto
[49:11] all the congregation of Israel saying in
[49:14] the 10th day of this month they shall
[49:16] take to them every man a lamb according
[49:18] to the house of their fathers a lamb for
[49:21] an house and if the household be too
[49:23] little for the lamb let him and his
[49:25] neighbor next un to him take it
[49:27] according to the number of the souls
[49:29] every man according to his eating shall
[49:31] make your count for the lamb your lamb
[49:34] shall be without blemish is a perfect
[49:36] type of Christ your lamb shall be
[49:38] without blemish and male of the first
[49:40] year you shall take it out from the
[49:43] sheep or from the goats and he and ye
[49:46] shall keep it up until the 14th day of
[49:50] the same month and the whole assembly of
[49:53] the congregation of Israel shall kill it
[49:56] in the
[49:57] evening and they shall take the blood
[50:00] and strike it on the two side post and
[50:03] on the upper doorpost of the house so it
[50:06] would make a perfect cross amen it's
[50:09] over the top and it's on the sides all
[50:11] right and they shall take the blood and
[50:13] strike it on the two sides of the post
[50:15] on the upper doorpost of the house
[50:17] wherein they shall eat it and they shall
[50:19] eat the Flesh in that night roast with
[50:22] fire and unleavened bread with bitter
[50:24] herbs shall they shall eat e it eat not
[50:27] of it raw nor Soden at all with water
[50:30] but roast with fire his head with his
[50:33] legs and with the pertinence thereof you
[50:35] shall let nothing of it remain until the
[50:38] morning and that which remaineth of it
[50:41] until the morning you shall burn with
[50:42] fire and thus shall you eat it with your
[50:45] loins girded your shoes on your feet and
[50:48] your staff in your hand and you shall
[50:50] eat it in haste it is the Lord's
[50:52] Passover for I will pass through the
[50:55] land of Egypt this night
[50:57] and will Smite all the firstborn in the
[51:00] land of Egypt both man and Beast and
[51:03] against all the gods of Egypt I will
[51:06] execute judgment I am the Lord and the
[51:09] blood shall be to you for a token upon
[51:12] the houses where you are and when I see
[51:16] the blood I will pass over you and the
[51:18] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[51:21] you when I smite the land of Egypt so
[51:25] they called it the Passover because the
[51:29] Lord the death angel passed over their
[51:32] houses and they did not suffer the death
[51:35] angel so it's a Passover meal to the
[51:39] Jews to this day let's
[51:42] pray Lord we thank you for your word now
[51:45] that we've read and I pray Lord for your
[51:48] anointing Spirit to be upon me as we go
[51:52] at a a a a measured Pace today Lord
[51:55] teaching the word of God a very very
[51:57] critical lesson today Lord very
[52:01] important perhaps the most important
[52:03] lesson that we could receive from the
[52:06] message of the hour Lord Brother
[52:08] brandham called it the very highlight of
[52:10] his ministry and that was taking into
[52:12] account all the great Miracles that had
[52:15] happened around the world and the tens
[52:17] of thousands of prophetic word that had
[52:20] went forth and he said the token was the
[52:22] highlight so Lord we ask for your mercy
[52:26] now as we look into it and father we'll
[52:28] go as far as today as we feel till we
[52:31] feel the tug of the Holy Spirit and the
[52:34] people have absorbed enough and Lord and
[52:37] we'll we'll carry on uh in services to
[52:40] come we commit it now to you give me
[52:42] wisdom as I go forward Lord I Thank you
[52:46] for the wonderful spirit I feel in my
[52:48] heart and my mind this morning I feel
[52:51] well rested I I feel just happy in my
[52:55] thoughts Lord and I'm happy happy to
[52:56] have the family of God here today Lord
[52:59] may you bless our our family who are out
[53:02] on the road traveling and in meetings in
[53:04] various places Lord perhaps they'll
[53:07] catch this by a stream as we already
[53:09] know some have told me they would some
[53:11] will catch it by an archive we commit it
[53:13] to you in Jesus name amen God bless you
[53:17] friends you can be
[53:22] seated all right brother Gideon let's
[53:24] have the uh PowerPoint
[53:37] amen so
[53:39] I covet your undivided attention today
[53:42] it'll be very important not only because
[53:45] we have a very important topic but
[53:48] because it's I'm going to take it today
[53:50] like U almost like it' be like an
[53:52] extended Sunday school class amen and
[53:55] your Sunday school teacher was going man
[53:57] I thought who was that masked man he was
[53:59] he was he was not stopping so amen we
[54:03] were but I was enjoying it amen I was
[54:05] enjoying that breakdown so we're going
[54:07] to your your minds are already in that
[54:09] mindset I'm sure you were here for the
[54:11] for the Sunday school class and so we
[54:13] want to continue on in a teaching vein
[54:16] now I have a lot of things I want to say
[54:19] I already know I'm not going to get to
[54:21] all of them I have a lot of quotes on
[54:23] this slide 58 slides I already know I'm
[54:26] not going to get to all of them it's
[54:28] okay breathe everything will be fine you
[54:30] know me I won't do that to you there is
[54:33] no death worse than being drugged to
[54:35] death and so we won't do that we'll go
[54:38] at a pace and a clip and uh but I want
[54:41] to unburden at least a certain portion
[54:43] of it of my heart today it's teaching so
[54:47] you're going to want to pay Keen
[54:48] attention so if you'll give me your
[54:51] undivided attention for 60 70 minutes or
[54:54] so we will we'll pull the shoot stand on
[54:56] the brakes as brother juel said and
[54:58] we'll get her on the ground praise the
[55:01] Lord Brother Don I appreciated your text
[55:04] I got that early this morning when I was
[55:05] up very early I appreciate that my
[55:07] brother all right so we're talking about
[55:11] the voice in the East Wind and we are
[55:14] taking today for for a subtit or not
[55:17] there not a subtitle that's coming next
[55:19] but our topic is the
[55:22] identification of Christ in our lives
[55:26] and and we are looking at a subtopic of
[55:30] the final plague and this is part two we
[55:32] carried on with part one from uh we
[55:36] started on part one of the final plague
[55:38] on Wednesday and we were showing you uh
[55:42] some amazing things concerning the token
[55:45] I don't want to don't have any time to
[55:47] go back and recap I would like to
[55:49] recommend that if you did not get that
[55:51] sermon please take the time and make my
[55:55] many hours of effort and study and
[55:58] prayer worth it will you do that if you
[56:00] didn't weren't here and you haven't
[56:02] heard it yet please go back find you a
[56:05] quiet 45 or 60 minutes where you can
[56:08] listen to it without interruption
[56:10] because as I say the token is perhaps I
[56:15] I if it is if not the most if not the
[56:19] actually the most important message that
[56:22] we have it's certainly one of the most
[56:24] important right at the top now I have a
[56:28] number of quotes and I just want to lead
[56:31] in a little bit because I know how I
[56:33] know how it is when you have a lot of
[56:36] quotes and of course my I have so many
[56:40] because I like my slides to be legible
[56:43] My sl my slides usually only have three
[56:45] four five uh if it has six sentences
[56:48] that's a lot because I don't put a lot
[56:50] on a slide I would rather take a slide
[56:53] that I you know that you can't read
[56:56] because it's you know 20 lines long and
[56:59] you can't read it anyway and I'll break
[57:00] it up into three or four slides so
[57:02] that's partly why I have so many so it
[57:04] will go quickly all right you good all
[57:08] right now in these quotes that we are
[57:11] going to look at from brother brandham
[57:13] he preached uh the token four different
[57:17] times and and I'm got quotes from the
[57:20] one called token that he preached in 63
[57:24] at his home Tabernacle in Jeffersonville
[57:26] I also have one uh another one that he
[57:29] preached uh sometime later in
[57:33] 1963 I believe in November and uh I'm
[57:36] not sure where he preached that but then
[57:38] I also have some quotes from when he
[57:41] preached it in February of
[57:44] 1964 and then he came one month later to
[57:48] the day uh in uh in Dallas and he
[57:52] preached it on March uh I believe March
[57:55] the uh the uh 8th in Dallas and and and
[57:58] he preached it those four times I think
[58:02] that that those four dates I almost put
[58:04] it on the on on this morning I almost
[58:07] put my first screen up to list those
[58:09] four dates along with my wday sermon and
[58:13] along with today's sermon and say these
[58:16] are dates which for you bethl Tabernacle
[58:20] I hope will live in infamy because they
[58:23] are so important to us as an assem
[58:27] and and actually I don't have I I
[58:29] realized that by the time I went through
[58:31] his first three sermons by the time I
[58:33] got to the fourth one everything was
[58:35] just repeating and I eliminated all the
[58:37] repeating unless it was absolutely
[58:39] necessary uh so I would recommend you
[58:43] that uh after this series today and
[58:45] maybe next week that you get that fourth
[58:47] part in fact is don't wait go ahead this
[58:49] week and get that fourth one preached in
[58:52] March of 1964 because I I'm not quoting
[58:55] from it in this lesson I have no plans
[58:57] to but it is fantastic and so brother
[59:01] brandom really demonstrates the the word
[59:04] there in Dallas Texas now in these
[59:07] quotes brother brandham I want you to to
[59:10] realize and and I'm going to help you
[59:12] because I want you to stay with me I
[59:13] don't want you to get lost in the
[59:14] shuffle so whenever I'm teaching I'm
[59:17] constantly I don't just like to read
[59:19] endlessly and and quote endlessly
[59:22] because you're sitting there hearing it
[59:24] and after a while it goes and you're
[59:26] like what what is he even saying and it
[59:28] just becomes words so my way of teaching
[59:31] is I like to tip you off in advance of
[59:35] what you're going to see this is what
[59:37] we're going in to look for all right so
[59:41] in these quotes brother brandham as he
[59:43] starts out is going to focus on the
[59:47] blood of Jesus as the token during the
[59:51] early part of the sermon uh in all three
[59:54] in all four sermons he does that he
[59:56] starts out by saying you know the blood
[59:58] of Jesus is the token and and and why
[1:00:01] wouldn't he because when we read in
[1:00:04] Exodus 12 God said this shall the blood
[1:00:07] shall be to you a token but brother
[1:00:10] brandham is going to explain that
[1:00:13] correct because that was under the Old
[1:00:16] Testament under the chemistry of the
[1:00:18] blood that that that it there had to be
[1:00:21] something painted on the outside of
[1:00:24] their dwelling because was the life of
[1:00:27] that lamb even though they had kept it
[1:00:29] up from the 10th to the 14th even though
[1:00:31] it was spotless a year of the fir lamb
[1:00:34] of the first year even though it was
[1:00:36] exactly what God had ordered according
[1:00:38] to his word and even though they
[1:00:40] followed the preparation and the
[1:00:43] consumption of it uh but nonetheless the
[1:00:47] innocent life of that lamb could not
[1:00:49] come back on them so at that time you're
[1:00:52] going to hear brother Brandon say all
[1:00:54] they could do was paint a representation
[1:00:57] using that blood of what it stood for in
[1:01:01] coming ages so that when you get to the
[1:01:04] coming ages it won't any longer be the
[1:01:07] chemistry of the blood See it'll
[1:01:11] actually be the life that was inside the
[1:01:14] blood that comes back on you and that's
[1:01:16] the token all right so he's going to
[1:01:20] progressively shift our understanding
[1:01:23] towards the Holy Spirit and not the
[1:01:27] blood the chemistry of the blood as the
[1:01:29] acceptable token in this end time hour
[1:01:33] and so that's where we are friends we
[1:01:35] have arrived at the end time hour and
[1:01:37] that's why uh the they they kept up a
[1:01:41] lamb for from the 10th to the 14th and
[1:01:44] and brother brandom is going to type
[1:01:46] that into the church ages they had the
[1:01:48] lamb in the church ages but at the
[1:01:51] evening time there had to be a display
[1:01:55] of the token
[1:01:56] they couldn't just keep keep keeping it
[1:01:58] in the pin they actually had to slay it
[1:02:00] and take the blood and put they couldn't
[1:02:02] just put it in a jar on the table they
[1:02:05] couldn't just be circumcised they had to
[1:02:08] actually display their token in order
[1:02:11] for the death angel to come to their
[1:02:13] door and see the blood and hear the
[1:02:16] voice of the blood remember he said thy
[1:02:19] brother he said to Cain the voice of thy
[1:02:21] brother's blood crith out to me so the
[1:02:24] the so in God's mind when there was life
[1:02:27] in blood then that blood had a voice and
[1:02:31] and even though Abel was he was dead the
[1:02:35] the fact that the life given by God had
[1:02:38] been in his blood the voice was still
[1:02:40] speaking see a lot of times people don't
[1:02:42] realize that when you leave this life
[1:02:45] you're not excluded from all your sins
[1:02:48] it still is speaking you're still going
[1:02:51] to go to a judgment see so death and
[1:02:54] people take their own life thinking
[1:02:55] they're going to get out of their pain
[1:02:57] that's only going from the frying pan
[1:02:59] into the fire that only makes the
[1:03:02] situation worse so death doesn't change
[1:03:05] anything no one has actually ever died
[1:03:09] yet no one there's never been anyone
[1:03:13] actually died yet they're they're all
[1:03:16] still very much alive in either a realm
[1:03:19] of the lost or the or somewhere under
[1:03:21] the altar of God under the land in the
[1:03:24] lands of the redeemed one of those two
[1:03:26] places there's no Purgatory well there
[1:03:28] is and you're in it
[1:03:30] now this is the in between Place amen
[1:03:33] and I don't need a priest to pray me out
[1:03:36] of here and I don't need to go buy a
[1:03:38] candle I can get I I can escape this and
[1:03:41] I've got a promise that I will escape
[1:03:44] it all
[1:03:45] right so so it's it's the evening time
[1:03:49] you're to eat it in haste and so these
[1:03:52] are little Clues to us how urgent this
[1:03:56] message ought to be in our minds it
[1:03:59] ought to be urgent because by the time
[1:04:03] the evening time came listen they had
[1:04:06] spent they had spent
[1:04:09] 430
[1:04:11] years and then they had spent four days
[1:04:15] pinning a lamb up and then they had to
[1:04:18] go through the whole process of
[1:04:20] slaughtering it but at but from the time
[1:04:22] it came to the evening time to the slang
[1:04:25] to to the to the putting it on the on
[1:04:27] and consuming it and putting it on their
[1:04:29] house and burning The Leftovers the next
[1:04:31] morning they were
[1:04:33] leaving just from one evening and the
[1:04:35] evening and the morning was a new day
[1:04:38] Hallelujah and that's where you and I
[1:04:39] have arrived friends we have arrived at
[1:04:42] the evening time and I'm telling you
[1:04:43] it's not going to be long it can't be
[1:04:47] long so it's an urgent hour and this is
[1:04:51] what brother Brandon is really trying to
[1:04:54] stress and I suppose
[1:04:57] that that this has got to be the chief
[1:05:01] stressing point is that we have arrived
[1:05:06] at a at a time and a moment an Epoch in
[1:05:12] history we have arrived at the moment
[1:05:16] that God's family and God have waited
[1:05:19] for through
[1:05:21] centuries and it and it has brought
[1:05:24] forth a chain and you need to get that
[1:05:28] something has
[1:05:30] changed and what used to work
[1:05:34] legitimately will no longer
[1:05:36] work see now so brother brandham is
[1:05:40] going to go he's going to progressively
[1:05:42] move from the blood he's going to
[1:05:43] actually say it the blood is the token
[1:05:45] and then he'll progressively shift our
[1:05:47] understanding towards the Holy Spirit
[1:05:49] and not the blood as the acceptable
[1:05:51] token in this in this end time hour
[1:05:58] now progression of course is the plan of
[1:06:01] being the plan of God I mean that's very
[1:06:03] obvious very noticeable in the word we
[1:06:06] we see how that you you had an age of
[1:06:10] you know you can take you can take
[1:06:12] Noah's day and the Earth received its
[1:06:15] baptism then you can come to Calvary and
[1:06:17] the blood of Jesus dripped on the earth
[1:06:20] so it so it was it was baptized under
[1:06:22] Noah it was Sanctified under Jesus and
[1:06:25] then the Holy Ghost came in the upper
[1:06:27] room and created a kingdom of God on the
[1:06:29] earth so you can see this
[1:06:31] progressiveness brother Brandon would
[1:06:32] then take those three events and overlay
[1:06:36] that with justification sanctification
[1:06:38] and the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:41] Spirit which must be distinctly
[1:06:44] understood as more by far than what
[1:06:48] struck the isua
[1:06:51] revivalist the the isua Revival in
[1:06:54] brother Bram taught us in many specs
[1:06:56] could just be an extension of of the
[1:06:58] Philadelphian age because it an Open
[1:07:00] Door gets set at the End of the Age
[1:07:02] which is a open door's always a
[1:07:04] revelation it's an Open Door of Christ
[1:07:06] and they're going to begin to catch some
[1:07:08] revelation after Wesley's gone because
[1:07:10] he died as a trinitarian and then you're
[1:07:13] going to have men at the end of the
[1:07:14] 1800s coming on the scene like parum and
[1:07:17] lake and Grant and Seymour and
[1:07:19] Wigglesworth and and and and Bosworth
[1:07:22] and and Bosworth brothers and the the
[1:07:24] the man who wrote uh only believe I
[1:07:26] forget his name but those those men were
[1:07:30] great men that came up out of that
[1:07:33] Revival and they were catching the
[1:07:35] revelation of the of the restoration of
[1:07:37] the deity of Jesus and so they started
[1:07:41] uh something unheard of they started
[1:07:43] baptizing according to acts 238 they
[1:07:45] started declaring that the Trinity is
[1:07:47] not a correct Doctrine see so so we find
[1:07:51] that that it then brother Bram talked
[1:07:53] about how that that Revival restored
[1:07:55] some of the power that the church ought
[1:07:57] to have had but it was lacking and so it
[1:08:00] brought back some of the power but
[1:08:01] that's uh that certainly was not the
[1:08:04] long awaited restoration of the word
[1:08:09] back to the original abstract title deed
[1:08:11] which would restore the full token to
[1:08:14] the church that comes under the opening
[1:08:16] of the word in our hour and
[1:08:19] only because it's
[1:08:23] Progressive so we find that God does it
[1:08:26] that
[1:08:30] way so we find then that he he baptized
[1:08:35] it under Noah he Sanctified it under the
[1:08:37] blood of Calvary and then the holy ghost
[1:08:39] in the New Testament which was a New
[1:08:41] Covenant God made a New Covenant with
[1:08:43] mankind that's what the New Testament is
[1:08:46] see and so and eventually it would
[1:08:49] become a claiming work of the Lamb to
[1:08:52] claim his Lamb's Book of Life now Paul
[1:08:56] just I'm just trying to help your mind
[1:08:58] in case in case you're coming to hear
[1:09:00] brother bradam say here this used to
[1:09:04] work and there was scripture for it but
[1:09:08] now it doesn't work anymore now other
[1:09:12] parts of the scripture have taken those
[1:09:14] scriptures further and you no longer can
[1:09:17] find God's satisfaction back here any
[1:09:20] longer now Paul in in his sermon if it
[1:09:24] troubles your mind you can find acts 17
[1:09:27] and we're not going to turn to it today
[1:09:29] I'm just trying to move through uh my my
[1:09:32] introduction so Paul speaking you know
[1:09:36] to the to the Jewish Church there and
[1:09:38] they're struggling with that they're
[1:09:40] struggling with 1600 years we we have
[1:09:44] the law of Moses and we had sacrifices
[1:09:47] and 1600 years you're telling us Paul
[1:09:50] that all of the things that we did and
[1:09:52] you know and and and we we had the uh we
[1:09:55] we had the Ark of the Covenant and we
[1:09:57] had you know the brass serpent we had
[1:09:59] the the labor and we had all of these
[1:10:01] different things and we had the Great
[1:10:03] temple and Paul is trying to come to say
[1:10:06] listen listen verse 30 and of the times
[1:10:09] of this ignorance God wined at but now
[1:10:13] commandeth all men everywhere to repent
[1:10:16] so there was a time in the Old Testament
[1:10:18] that he gave them a workable solution
[1:10:21] that couldn't do away with their sin but
[1:10:24] it it could it it literally held off
[1:10:26] judgment God the Bible shows how that he
[1:10:29] restrained pouring out judgment waiting
[1:10:32] for the Lamb of God so that his his
[1:10:34] judgment could be satisfied lest he
[1:10:37] destroy all of his creation so we find
[1:10:40] then that Paul is saying yes it used to
[1:10:43] work but now he requireth every man to
[1:10:46] repent Peter told you that on the day of
[1:10:48] Pentecost and I'm coming behind Peter to
[1:10:51] say this is what you have to do you
[1:10:54] can't just be a devout Jew anymore Peter
[1:10:57] was preaching to Devout Jews not hor
[1:11:00] mongers not drunkards devout Jews and
[1:11:04] Peter was saying You must repent you
[1:11:08] must change your mind you must be
[1:11:10] baptized in his name and now Paul is
[1:11:12] saying yeah Peter wasn't wrong you used
[1:11:15] to have a system that system God honored
[1:11:18] it God gave it to you but God doesn't
[1:11:20] honor it anymore he now requires you to
[1:11:22] come forward in the word amen
[1:11:26] amen so this is all through the Bible I
[1:11:29] don't have time to get bogged down in it
[1:11:31] today we can see it in nature a child
[1:11:33] comes through water blood and spirit
[1:11:35] that's and and that's a spiritual type
[1:11:38] of the three stages of redemption so we
[1:11:41] realize that that that Christ when
[1:11:44] Christ died not only as a baby born
[1:11:46] through water blood and then life or
[1:11:49] Spirit we find that Christ died and he
[1:11:53] released when the Roman spear pierced
[1:11:56] his side then brother brandham said out
[1:12:00] the Bible says out come water and blood
[1:12:02] and brother branam shows it came water
[1:12:05] blood and life say now wait a minute he
[1:12:09] was already dead correct his human life
[1:12:12] had already left the body it expired but
[1:12:15] there was a life inside his blood that
[1:12:17] made him a unique
[1:12:19] human you understand he wasn't like
[1:12:22] Solomon he wasn't like you and me
[1:12:24] exactly he was kind of he was 100% a man
[1:12:27] but he was also 100% God we got the
[1:12:29] quote here for it in a
[1:12:31] minute so we find then that brother
[1:12:33] brandham said that released the bride
[1:12:36] and what does that even mean it released
[1:12:39] the life that was in brother brandham
[1:12:40] said that Roman the tip of that Roman
[1:12:43] spear pierced that original spoken word
[1:12:47] blood cell from which all the other
[1:12:49] blood cells had multiplied from that's
[1:12:52] how he was virgin born it wasn't wasn't
[1:12:54] God seed in Mary's egg God created both
[1:12:57] a fertilized seed and the Egg and
[1:13:00] fertilized it himself and that blood
[1:13:02] cell and God's life was put inside that
[1:13:05] blood cell all right you're going to see
[1:13:07] all this just in a
[1:13:08] moment so we find then that that that
[1:13:12] that that life then comes out of him
[1:13:15] when that blood cell is released and
[1:13:17] that releases a bride how so because
[1:13:20] listen as I've said to you before in
[1:13:22] Isaiah 42 there's only one elected son
[1:13:26] there's only one people get upset when
[1:13:29] we talk about election though it's a
[1:13:30] Bible word and a Bible teaching and I
[1:13:33] and I I A lot of times you can they say
[1:13:35] oh you think you're elected you think
[1:13:36] you're some elitism say no listen
[1:13:39] there's only one elected son and that's
[1:13:40] Christ according to Isaiah 42 well how
[1:13:43] did you get elected I was in
[1:13:45] him I was in Christ before the
[1:13:47] foundation of the world I'm a part of
[1:13:50] him so when his life came out I came out
[1:13:53] and that life came back in the church
[1:13:54] and found people like you and
[1:13:57] me see and it brought that brought a new
[1:14:02] birth something that had never happened
[1:14:05] the Holy Ghost had fallen upon people it
[1:14:08] fell on Moses it fell on the prophets
[1:14:10] but they were never born again it
[1:14:12] couldn't remain on them see so so we
[1:14:16] find then that that the church ages
[1:14:19] we're just looking at progression now
[1:14:21] just so that so that you don't struggle
[1:14:24] with these things that brand is going to
[1:14:25] say it's it's the Bible is replete and
[1:14:28] nature is replete with these kinds of
[1:14:30] examples the church ages came through
[1:14:32] justification sanctification and the
[1:14:35] Holy Spirit baptism which is the token
[1:14:38] Luther and Wesley and all the reformers
[1:14:41] they had you're going to hear Brother
[1:14:43] brandham show you they had the true lamb
[1:14:46] brother Bram said don't say they didn't
[1:14:47] have the Holy Ghost they certainly did
[1:14:50] don't say they weren't born again they
[1:14:52] certainly were they're part of the first
[1:14:54] resurrection
[1:14:56] however because of the limit of what
[1:14:59] they had they without us can never be
[1:15:02] made perfect it's going to take you and
[1:15:05] I for the finishing piece and that's
[1:15:07] going to bring them up out of the grave
[1:15:09] and then we which are alive and remain
[1:15:11] will be changed oh friends you're you're
[1:15:14] in a part of something you're in the big
[1:15:16] middle of the greatest event 6,000 years
[1:15:19] in the making and God's just that close
[1:15:22] to getting his family home
[1:15:26] don't forsake it now my goodness don't
[1:15:29] let anyone Sidetrack you or distract you
[1:15:32] or disuade you God has sent the greatest
[1:15:35] lifegiving word since Jesus walked the
[1:15:38] shores of
[1:15:40] Galilee see so Luther and Wesley and all
[1:15:44] the reformers they had the true lamb
[1:15:46] they had faith in the real Christ but
[1:15:51] but but remember they would have been if
[1:15:54] you're running your types in the Old
[1:15:56] Testament brother brandham ties them
[1:15:58] back to the era when the lamb was pinned
[1:16:02] up not the evening time the token only
[1:16:06] came at the evening time Luther and
[1:16:09] Wesley had the true lamb but it's during
[1:16:11] the time when it's being pinned up and
[1:16:14] it's and and it's going from the 10th to
[1:16:16] the 14th day allowing for inspection
[1:16:19] allowing for Preparation but the token
[1:16:22] was at even it was an even evening time
[1:16:26] event this is
[1:16:29] clear amen so of course the token being
[1:16:34] on display in the true living members of
[1:16:38] the true church is not a new thing the
[1:16:42] early church certainly had it on display
[1:16:46] brother brandom said they absolutely had
[1:16:48] the abstract title deed they had the
[1:16:52] ministry of the son of man they were the
[1:16:55] word made flesh in a bride they
[1:16:57] certainly had the full word see we don't
[1:17:01] get more more Revelation every
[1:17:04] revelation we have is based on what Paul
[1:17:06] taught and if that's not true tell me
[1:17:08] which Doctrine we have that he didn't
[1:17:11] teach I've challenged men who try to say
[1:17:13] we go further our Revelation well and
[1:17:16] they don't stop there our relation goes
[1:17:18] further than William brandom good grief
[1:17:19] what you just like get hit by a truck
[1:17:23] how can you possibly say that
[1:17:25] you know and and you can't go beyond
[1:17:27] what Paul Paul said no nobody can add to
[1:17:30] what I've laid down here all you can do
[1:17:33] is build on what I've said Paul's words
[1:17:36] could not be countermanded even by God
[1:17:39] because God gave Paul his words and God
[1:17:41] can't change his mind about his
[1:17:44] word see so there is no Doctrine and I
[1:17:48] I've challenge them to please give me
[1:17:50] the doctrine that we believe that we
[1:17:52] understand that Paul didn't preach on
[1:17:54] even even even when John comes back with
[1:17:57] the Book of Revelation and it gets open
[1:17:59] to us in the end time by a Prophet
[1:18:01] Elijah guess what it lines up with
[1:18:04] everything Paul taught
[1:18:06] us Paul wasn't even here and he was
[1:18:09] preaching the teachings of the Book of
[1:18:11] Revelation was already gone when it come
[1:18:13] back that's why you never hear him quote
[1:18:14] quote from it but yet everything that's
[1:18:17] in it is based on what he
[1:18:20] taught so it's not a it's not a it's not
[1:18:22] a situation you know I just said which
[1:18:25] Doctrine I'm
[1:18:27] predestination election the the serpent
[1:18:30] seed water baptism the godhead marriage
[1:18:33] and divorce who is this
[1:18:35] mdic which one the Rapture mystery the
[1:18:39] coming of the mighty one which one the
[1:18:41] man of sin to be revealed which one
[1:18:43] which Doctrine do we have that came out
[1:18:46] of the opening of the seals that doesn't
[1:18:49] amplify and bring to perfect
[1:18:51] understanding what the Apostle taught
[1:18:53] us dis obey Paul at your own
[1:18:58] Peril this is why brother Brandon was
[1:19:00] thankful he only ever taught what Paul
[1:19:02] taught and nobody can disprove
[1:19:04] that say well he says those Millions
[1:19:07] shouted we're resting on that well I
[1:19:09] believe that
[1:19:10] story but even if that story wasn't a
[1:19:12] story I would to Simply say to you find
[1:19:15] which which Doctrine is in this message
[1:19:17] that can't be proven by Paul's Doctrine
[1:19:20] there's not one I've challenged that
[1:19:22] around the world I'm T taking taking all
[1:19:26] comers I've been for 30 40 years proving
[1:19:29] this Bible proving the message in the
[1:19:32] Bible back and forth back and forth they
[1:19:34] dovetail
[1:19:37] flawlessly there's no contradiction them
[1:19:39] at all and they bring life and Liberty
[1:19:42] to God's family like nothing the world
[1:19:45] has got a hold of see so so I know I
[1:19:49] don't need to say that here that's just
[1:19:51] uh preaching to the choir here let me
[1:19:52] move on
[1:19:55] so we find then that that they certainly
[1:19:59] had the token in the in the alpha Church
[1:20:02] they had it on
[1:20:03] display uh because you're going to find
[1:20:06] out that to be on display means it's a
[1:20:08] display in your
[1:20:10] life I don't need brother bradam didn't
[1:20:13] need and Jesus doesn't need you to go
[1:20:15] home and paint anything on your house to
[1:20:18] prove you're a Christian he doesn't need
[1:20:21] you to put a cross on your front door or
[1:20:23] draw a fish on your car are he doesn't
[1:20:25] need you to wear a crucifix around your
[1:20:27] neck you're welcome to do any and all
[1:20:29] the above but that's not what he's
[1:20:31] talking about it's the voice of my life
[1:20:33] that
[1:20:37] proves so they certainly had it on
[1:20:40] display but the seed like Christ of
[1:20:43] course we know in the ages it had to go
[1:20:45] into the ground just like Jesus did they
[1:20:47] wanted him to be a king right away he
[1:20:49] couldn't do that it broke the it broke
[1:20:51] all the the types and shadows that had
[1:20:53] already been set over 4 thousand years
[1:20:55] of Old Testament history it wasn't he
[1:20:56] wasn't going to undo all of that and so
[1:20:59] just like Christ the seed had to go
[1:21:01] under the ground the church had to go
[1:21:03] into the ground they fell away and so we
[1:21:06] are H you say well do we go do we come
[1:21:09] to anything further than the early
[1:21:11] church we do and that is a body change
[1:21:15] so they didn't get a body change we get
[1:21:18] a body change so this message has
[1:21:20] restored back the original teaching to
[1:21:23] take us back to the Apex of where the
[1:21:25] early church began to Crest over and
[1:21:27] decline we go back to that Apex and
[1:21:30] carry it on to the Millennium see and
[1:21:33] the only way to do that is by we have
[1:21:35] the restoration of the same
[1:21:37] word see all right so through water
[1:21:40] through blood through Spirit
[1:21:42] justification sanctification and the
[1:21:44] return of the original Full Life of
[1:21:46] Christ on display again that is the
[1:21:50] message of the token amen it's on
[1:21:53] display yeah it's not about 4 days from
[1:21:57] the 10th to the 14th it's not it is
[1:21:59] about that but it's not mainly about
[1:22:01] that it's not it is about eating it in
[1:22:03] haste but it's not mainly about it
[1:22:05] eating in haste it is burning it with
[1:22:06] fire but it's not mainly about that what
[1:22:09] it mainly is is that life has to be on
[1:22:14] display that's what it means when
[1:22:17] brother brandham says apply the token
[1:22:22] people sometimes don't know what that
[1:22:24] they say they hear him say apply the
[1:22:25] token what does that even mean it means
[1:22:27] to display the Life of Christ in your
[1:22:30] life we're not just talking about a a
[1:22:33] modern idea of the Life of Christ we're
[1:22:36] talking about a life that they had in
[1:22:39] the early church where it makes men the
[1:22:42] kind of men that live back there and
[1:22:44] women the kind of Bible ladies that they
[1:22:46] had back there
[1:22:48] see so it it brings the same power do
[1:22:51] you believe it it brings the same author
[1:22:54] it it it bring and and you know and you
[1:22:56] know what it come you know how we get
[1:22:58] there God's already did his part he's
[1:23:00] already given us the the word what what
[1:23:03] is our part is to put it on display we
[1:23:05] we say oh I want the same power I want
[1:23:07] the same Authority well it takes the
[1:23:09] same dedication it takes the same kind
[1:23:12] of sincerity you have to be indwelled by
[1:23:14] the same spirit that raised Jesus from
[1:23:17] the
[1:23:20] dead when it happened in the alpha age
[1:23:22] it established the church and the
[1:23:24] literally wrote a book of Acts behind it
[1:23:26] it
[1:23:27] must do that
[1:23:29] again it must do the same thing in this
[1:23:33] hour for we live in an unparalleled day
[1:23:37] want me to tell you something friends
[1:23:38] your family is growing up in Satan's
[1:23:42] Eden with every modern trap imaginable
[1:23:46] and many that'll be invented you can't
[1:23:48] even imagine and we're already seeing
[1:23:51] things that were just science fiction
[1:23:53] just a decade ago go I'm here to tell
[1:23:55] you listen to me well your family is
[1:23:59] being raised and reared in Satan's Eden
[1:24:03] it is an unprecedented time it is an
[1:24:05] unparalleled day you cannot afford to
[1:24:09] not have the token on display applied to
[1:24:14] your home applied to your life
[1:24:17] amen see your family is growing up and
[1:24:22] it's there's every modern trap of the
[1:24:24] devil it's more needed now than in any
[1:24:27] hour
[1:24:29] before so since it was lost Through the
[1:24:31] Ages and is now fully restored it
[1:24:35] becomes necessary to recognize it again
[1:24:39] and to observe it again and this is what
[1:24:42] brother brandham really is pointing to
[1:24:45] in all four of those
[1:24:48] sermons we must come back to be like the
[1:24:51] first church in the book of Acts brother
[1:24:54] Henry green loved him long ago gone old
[1:24:58] War General from back in the day my
[1:25:00] childhood and he used to always say God
[1:25:04] started his church like he wanted it and
[1:25:07] now he wants it like he started it
[1:25:11] hallelujah how many bethl Tabernacle
[1:25:13] will agree with
[1:25:15] that so the token was how the early
[1:25:18] church was
[1:25:19] identified the token on display in their
[1:25:24] lives was was how the early church was
[1:25:28] identified as separate and different
[1:25:31] from the false church that began to be
[1:25:34] formed right after the outpouring of the
[1:25:36] Holy Ghost in the upper room and it
[1:25:38] looked just like the true church there
[1:25:40] it hadn't had all this time yet to be
[1:25:43] way apart right at at that point it had
[1:25:46] not turned from the truth un fables it
[1:25:49] was still it still looked just like it
[1:25:52] still looked just like the truth and you
[1:25:54] could hardly tell it apart except it
[1:25:56] began to get a little rough around the
[1:25:58] edges and they begin to take people in
[1:26:01] the church who weren't actually getting
[1:26:03] born
[1:26:04] again you see a few you see a few uh
[1:26:07] episodes you see ananas and saf lying to
[1:26:11] the Holy Ghost and you know it's amazing
[1:26:13] I I don't know how trinitarian gets
[1:26:15] around the fact that they lied to the
[1:26:17] Holy Ghost and Peter said you haven't
[1:26:18] lied to man you've lied to
[1:26:20] God so which one do I mean is God or is
[1:26:24] it God or is it the Holy Ghost which one
[1:26:25] you lie to so so we find then that the
[1:26:30] token on
[1:26:32] display was and that's the life on
[1:26:35] display that was the difference between
[1:26:40] those who were True
[1:26:42] Believers and those who what we call
[1:26:45] today and we coin a modern phrase called
[1:26:47] easy
[1:26:49] believism now uh actually Billy Graham
[1:26:53] is the one attributed with first coining
[1:26:56] that phrase easy believism and uh you
[1:27:01] know our dear precious brother and
[1:27:03] brother brandham loved him and I think
[1:27:05] he was a great man and I know he'll have
[1:27:07] a reward but brother brandham said the
[1:27:09] flaw in his ministry he didn't call it a
[1:27:11] flaw that's my word but brother brandham
[1:27:13] talks about the problem that was there
[1:27:15] was that he only brought the people
[1:27:17] through a decision and he didn't take
[1:27:18] them all the way to the new birth and he
[1:27:21] said I come into a city and I have
[1:27:23] 30,000 vergins at the altar and I come
[1:27:26] back in a year and I can't find
[1:27:28] 30 still fighting the fight of faith
[1:27:31] that still looked like him he was a real
[1:27:33] Christian see and so so we realized then
[1:27:36] that his ministry actually uh he he
[1:27:39] didn't recognize it uh there's no
[1:27:42] indication he ever recognized it but his
[1:27:44] ministry helped along easy believism now
[1:27:47] it wasn't a new they had that in the
[1:27:50] early church uh that was called
[1:27:52] gnosticism and different things like
[1:27:54] that and they they immediately um began
[1:27:57] to try to pull away from uh the token
[1:28:00] being on display in Godly
[1:28:02] Lifestyles now in fact is there's been a
[1:28:05] 30-year running debate you may have
[1:28:08] heard of it between John MacArthur his
[1:28:10] version of what is called lordship
[1:28:12] salvation versus Zay haj's teaching
[1:28:15] labeled and they label it easy believism
[1:28:18] it actually comes out of they've kind of
[1:28:21] fixed it because there was such an out
[1:28:24] cry over the last three decades but it
[1:28:26] was the main teaching of Dallas
[1:28:28] Theological Seminary it was just easy
[1:28:30] believism that's why your mega church
[1:28:33] across the town here has no
[1:28:35] standards and they they have no problem
[1:28:38] telling you that they they don't believe
[1:28:40] we we had a we had a man come to this
[1:28:42] church and he and he liked coming here
[1:28:44] and he's still a Believer to this day
[1:28:46] moved on somewhere else but while he was
[1:28:47] here he had a girlfriend that came with
[1:28:49] him from that church and she sat here a
[1:28:52] few services and she wanted to see me in
[1:28:54] the back so he brought her and we sat
[1:28:56] down he wanted me to try to explain some
[1:28:58] things to her and I took some time to
[1:29:01] explain it and she says well I just want
[1:29:02] to go back to my other church and I and
[1:29:04] I said well why is that she said well
[1:29:06] because over there we can just pretty
[1:29:08] much do whatever we
[1:29:10] want said to me and I knew that to be
[1:29:13] true because I knew other people who go
[1:29:15] over there and that come out of DTS that
[1:29:18] come out of Dallas Theological Seminary
[1:29:21] that they are the main uh they are the
[1:29:24] main source of easy
[1:29:27] believism where it's just where it's
[1:29:29] just you know where it's just Grace uh
[1:29:32] you know and and and and and it's it's
[1:29:35] just faith alone that justifies it's
[1:29:38] just faith alone you don't have to make
[1:29:40] any change you don't actually have to be
[1:29:42] born again there's no really such thing
[1:29:43] as the Holy Ghost you just make a
[1:29:46] decision and you just become a better
[1:29:49] person see and so so you know I I like
[1:29:53] this statement the reformers used to
[1:29:55] make the reformers said many of the
[1:29:58] reformers coined this phrase that said
[1:30:01] that while faith alone
[1:30:03] justifies the faith that justifies is
[1:30:06] never
[1:30:08] alone that's a good statement the faith
[1:30:11] that
[1:30:12] justifies we certainly are faith alone
[1:30:16] justifies but the faith that justifies
[1:30:19] is never alone faith alone
[1:30:22] justifies but the faith that justifies
[1:30:24] is never alone it brings a real change
[1:30:27] if you get the real
[1:30:31] justification see so although lordship
[1:30:34] salvation which MacArthur preaches
[1:30:36] heavily that it has to be an impact in
[1:30:38] your life there has to be a repentance
[1:30:40] there has to be a change there has to be
[1:30:41] the lordship of the Savior over your
[1:30:44] life I admire him for that he's
[1:30:46] completely misunderstanding the godhead
[1:30:48] and he's a died in the wool trinitarian
[1:30:50] but hey you know I'm not his judge I'm
[1:30:53] not to judge another man's servant to
[1:30:54] his own Master he rises or Falls all
[1:30:58] right so so we find then my device
[1:31:02] better to cooperate that that that while
[1:31:04] his teaching is certainly closer to the
[1:31:07] truth that that that but that what they
[1:31:10] been debating since the
[1:31:13] 1980s and I and I would sit down and say
[1:31:15] you're both wrong you're both wrong yeah
[1:31:19] lordship salvation is closer but uh
[1:31:22] Oneness is closer than but they're both
[1:31:25] wrong you understand the problem that
[1:31:28] that here's what I would say listen you
[1:31:30] you've been debating this for 30 years
[1:31:32] since the since even longer than 30
[1:31:34] years it started coming out in the 80s
[1:31:36] I'm here to tell you that William
[1:31:37] Brandon was setting the record straight
[1:31:40] in the
[1:31:41] 1960s under an Elijah anointing he was
[1:31:44] setting the record straight preaching
[1:31:47] the
[1:31:50] token the problem really when you break
[1:31:52] it down is a miss understanding of the
[1:31:54] godhead because the godhead is not a
[1:31:57] teachable Doctrine in a Creed he's the
[1:31:59] person of the almighty God see so in
[1:32:03] these quotes if we get to any of them
[1:32:05] today in these quotes uh brother Brandon
[1:32:09] will
[1:32:10] describe how individual
[1:32:13] believers who are according to the
[1:32:16] scripture the house of the Lord they
[1:32:19] must be covered by this token so it's
[1:32:23] you got to have the token applied to
[1:32:24] your home but you're also a house so
[1:32:27] it's got to be applied to you and
[1:32:29] applied to your home and applied to your
[1:32:30] children see so it's got to be on
[1:32:33] display so the the the the text
[1:32:37] emphasizes you know the the that what
[1:32:39] the way brother Brandon begins to break
[1:32:41] this down is that it's going to
[1:32:44] emphasize that the followers of Christ
[1:32:47] are to be in Union with Christ that's
[1:32:49] what the token is about and and as such
[1:32:52] they they will have have his very
[1:32:56] distinctive
[1:32:58] nature very different from the world
[1:33:02] very different as night is from day and
[1:33:05] it's it's miles and millenniums Beyond
[1:33:08] even what modern Christianity says his
[1:33:10] nature is when I look at their services
[1:33:14] and what they what goes on on their
[1:33:16] platforms I'm here to tell you with love
[1:33:19] and consideration for their ignorance
[1:33:21] that is not the nature of Jes Jesus
[1:33:24] Christ that I'm
[1:33:26] seeing
[1:33:29] see so so we find that he's also going
[1:33:32] to disclose in these quotes the
[1:33:35] necessity of displaying the token
[1:33:39] through Faith and Action because the
[1:33:43] token is part of your
[1:33:47] identification amen the token on display
[1:33:51] is part of your identification with
[1:33:54] Christ it shows ownership and that is
[1:33:57] really really good news because it means
[1:34:01] that then you can bring your token when
[1:34:03] sickness comes into your house and you
[1:34:06] can come to the devil and and brother
[1:34:08] Brandon says show him your token people
[1:34:10] say what does that mean uh it means the
[1:34:13] same thing as apply the token it means
[1:34:16] you can walk up there and the Bible says
[1:34:18] if our heart condemns us not we can have
[1:34:21] faith toward God is that right so the
[1:34:24] way you do is you come to the devil and
[1:34:25] you say let me tell you something I am a
[1:34:28] Christian and you know I'm a Christian
[1:34:31] and I nothing to do with you and my
[1:34:33] heart has no condemnation I'm a believer
[1:34:36] of the word I'm the property of Christ
[1:34:39] and you have no rights in my
[1:34:44] home that's why he can't hold your
[1:34:46] children against your will because you
[1:34:49] have because you're willing to live on
[1:34:52] display
[1:34:54] and the devil knows that cuzz he sees
[1:34:57] it and you can't trick
[1:35:01] him because he sees you in
[1:35:06] secret but when you know that you have
[1:35:09] the token on display then the devil
[1:35:12] knows that so so we find it's part of
[1:35:16] your
[1:35:17] identification the port the portrayal of
[1:35:20] the token literally extends in this way
[1:35:23] to practi iCal aspects such as healing
[1:35:26] uh responding to challenges and brother
[1:35:29] brandham is going to use it as a term
[1:35:31] and he's going to say it's a badge of
[1:35:34] recognition to the
[1:35:36] world so the token is many things the
[1:35:40] token on display it is a badge of
[1:35:44] recognition you carry a badge of
[1:35:47] identification and Authority Devils see
[1:35:50] it your neighbors see it your church
[1:35:53] family sees
[1:35:54] it amen it is your life from a willing
[1:36:00] heart not works not about gritted teeth
[1:36:04] not because I don't want to go to hell
[1:36:06] not because I don't want to miss the
[1:36:07] Rapture it's your whole desire has
[1:36:10] changed the worshipper once purged has
[1:36:13] no more conscience of sin the desires of
[1:36:17] the world are gone from
[1:36:21] him and his desires are for
[1:36:25] Christ all
[1:36:27] right out of 58 slides I probably got
[1:36:30] enough time to get to maybe
[1:36:33] two all right that's okay I'm perfectly
[1:36:37] satisfied with where I'm at
[1:36:39] today all right so let's take about the
[1:36:42] last 10 15 minutes and we will look at a
[1:36:45] maybe two or three at the most but I'm
[1:36:47] going to watch the clock and I got about
[1:36:49] 19 minutes before the top of the hour
[1:36:51] you good yeah come on you americ
[1:36:54] everybody good got a cushion seed air
[1:36:56] conditioned building people next to you
[1:36:58] smell good it's all good you're fine all
[1:37:01] right we'll get the girls up here to
[1:37:03] sing for you if you get too bored all
[1:37:06] right so brother brandham comes here and
[1:37:09] this is his first iteration of it in uh
[1:37:13] in September in his Tabernacle I
[1:37:15] actually have the token but that's
[1:37:16] actually titled just token so he says
[1:37:20] here
[1:37:21] Christianity has to display its token
[1:37:26] publicly amen catch it again it has to
[1:37:30] display its token publicly in public
[1:37:35] life at the office on the street when
[1:37:40] trouble is around in church and
[1:37:45] everywhere
[1:37:47] else you shouldn't look at work
[1:37:49] different than you look at church you
[1:37:51] shouldn't look at in the shopping places
[1:37:54] you shouldn't go on
[1:37:56] vacation and have a different display
[1:37:59] than you have
[1:38:02] here
[1:38:04] amen a
[1:38:07] amen have brother Kenny CL sing it
[1:38:10] amen should have probably started you
[1:38:12] all so you got a good exercise so he
[1:38:15] says and everywhere else here he is now
[1:38:19] you see that red there the reason that's
[1:38:21] in there is for clarity you ever read
[1:38:23] the Amplified Bible and it'll take the
[1:38:26] King James and it'll add words in for
[1:38:28] clarity just to amplify the meaning so
[1:38:30] you don't miss it sometimes King James
[1:38:32] can get a little because it's archaic
[1:38:35] and you especially in Paul's abstract
[1:38:36] way of writing you miss what he's saying
[1:38:38] sometimes so I've added that for clarity
[1:38:41] so everywhere you see red that's me just
[1:38:44] adding he say you're adding to the quote
[1:38:46] calm down I know what I'm doing I do
[1:38:49] this for a living it's all good you I
[1:38:51] won't kill you I promise
[1:38:55] I've been studying this message since a
[1:38:57] boy so give me some some some card
[1:39:00] blanch here the blood of Jesus is the
[1:39:05] token and the token must be applied or
[1:39:09] as brother brandom says in the very top
[1:39:11] in case you think I'm on a li on a limb
[1:39:12] at the bottom he says
[1:39:14] displayed so when he says applied just
[1:39:18] think
[1:39:19] displayed this is why it's applied in
[1:39:21] your home it's displayed it's why it's
[1:39:23] applied to the devil it's why it's a
[1:39:24] badge it's displayed it's why it gives
[1:39:26] you Authority cuz it's displayed
[1:39:30] see all right so so we find then watch
[1:39:35] so the blood is the token and the token
[1:39:40] must be
[1:39:42] applied all right um uh must be
[1:39:46] applied if it's
[1:39:48] not even the Covenant of faith in Christ
[1:39:52] cuz that's what he's talking about and
[1:39:54] if you go listen to the sermon you'll
[1:39:56] understand why I've got it that way
[1:39:57] that's what he's talking about go listen
[1:39:58] to all four takes I have all right so
[1:40:02] even the Covenant of faith in Christ
[1:40:06] like John
[1:40:07] 3:16 like John
[1:40:09] 5:24 amen you know like like acts 238
[1:40:15] the promises unto you you'll receive the
[1:40:17] Holy Ghost no you
[1:40:19] won't if you're not willing to surrender
[1:40:22] your heart if you're not willing to
[1:40:24] completely repent and walk away from the
[1:40:27] world repent means to turn around and go
[1:40:29] the other way if you just want some some
[1:40:32] battle relief and you want to turn over
[1:40:34] a new Leaf you're never going to get the
[1:40:36] Seal of the Holy
[1:40:40] Ghost so so so you realize then that
[1:40:44] that even the Covenant is not in effect
[1:40:47] that's what brother R was saying if it's
[1:40:49] not even the Covenant is not in effect
[1:40:52] to that in individual now brother Braham
[1:40:55] is not saying the Covenant is not in
[1:40:57] effect he's saying to the individual
[1:40:58] it's not see just like a pardon is only
[1:41:01] a pardon if you receive it as a pardon
[1:41:03] you Jesus said you by your Traditions
[1:41:06] have made the word of God of no
[1:41:10] effect see so it's not that the word
[1:41:13] isn't effective it's that you've made it
[1:41:16] ineffective to yourself and to other
[1:41:18] people yeah all right so you have to
[1:41:22] realize then
[1:41:23] that his blood let me let me let me just
[1:41:25] try to break down and then I'm going to
[1:41:28] show you with the quotes I it's
[1:41:30] dangerous because I don't have time to
[1:41:31] get to all the quotes and I don't know
[1:41:32] if I'm going to able to prove it with
[1:41:33] the two or three that I have um this is
[1:41:38] risky um let me
[1:41:42] try so I want to try to help you
[1:41:46] understand when brother Brenham talks
[1:41:48] about the blood and he talks about the
[1:41:50] life in the blood and this will help you
[1:41:53] you with your understanding of the
[1:41:54] godhead it'll help you understand who
[1:41:55] Jesus was and his human relationship to
[1:41:59] a supernatural
[1:42:01] God understand and how that
[1:42:03] paradoxically he wasn't a second
[1:42:06] person he was the person and brother
[1:42:09] brandham shows that in the scripture is
[1:42:11] so clear in that so remember that his
[1:42:14] blood that flowed on
[1:42:16] Calvary it
[1:42:18] was notice how I say this going to be
[1:42:20] very
[1:42:22] clear his blood that was shed on
[1:42:25] Calvary was innocent
[1:42:28] blood and it was shed for you and
[1:42:32] me and without the shedding of blood the
[1:42:36] blood of
[1:42:38] God was it the blood of God the Bible
[1:42:40] says it was brother Ram says it was he
[1:42:42] didn't have he wasn't the blood of a Jew
[1:42:44] he wasn't the blood of a gentile he was
[1:42:46] the blood of God
[1:42:48] Amen so his innocent blood that was shed
[1:42:51] for you and me
[1:42:53] and we know that without the shedding of
[1:42:56] the blood of God there is no remission
[1:42:58] for our sins is that right and say Amen
[1:43:03] we know that we are Washed by the blood
[1:43:07] of the Lamb are you washed in the blood
[1:43:11] in the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb
[1:43:14] we sing that that's a Bible uh backing
[1:43:17] song so we are Washed by the blood of
[1:43:20] the lamb in fact is the foolish virgin
[1:43:22] the B The Book of Revelation shows us
[1:43:25] they actually wash their robes in the
[1:43:28] blood of the lamb for cleansing because
[1:43:30] they don't have his righteousness
[1:43:31] otherwise if they had had his
[1:43:32] righteousness they'd have been born
[1:43:33] again and they'd went in the Rapture so
[1:43:36] after they give their life and suffer
[1:43:38] the Judgment of Jacob's trouble they
[1:43:40] actually wash their robes in the blood
[1:43:42] of the Lamb the bride does not do this
[1:43:44] people think that's the bride it's not
[1:43:46] the bride the bride has no need to wash
[1:43:48] her robes and the blood of the Lamb
[1:43:51] because a prophet said you you are the
[1:43:53] blood of God by the spirit I don't need
[1:43:56] to wash my garments I've already dressed
[1:43:59] in the garments of the bleeding word and
[1:44:01] I already am the blood of God by the
[1:44:04] spirit because I've been baptized by the
[1:44:06] Holy
[1:44:08] Ghost we are kept by the blood amen
[1:44:12] that's right you're saved through faith
[1:44:14] you're kept by the blood so but there
[1:44:16] but but there has to be a way to get a
[1:44:21] transfer of that in ENT
[1:44:24] sacrifice onto US who are born in sin
[1:44:28] that's the rub that's the problem that's
[1:44:31] the
[1:44:31] disconnect was not a problem with the
[1:44:34] blood of Jesus it was the blood of God
[1:44:36] it was innocent it was holy all right
[1:44:40] but but but none of us here here it is
[1:44:44] none of us and if you do please stand up
[1:44:47] none of us have his physical chemical
[1:44:51] blood
[1:44:53] who's got it does the Vatican have it no
[1:44:56] is it in Jerusalem somewhere no is it at
[1:44:58] the brandham Tabernacle no no one has
[1:45:02] his physical blood so how are you going
[1:45:05] to get his physical blood see there has
[1:45:09] to be a way to get that innocent
[1:45:14] life that's not needed since the life in
[1:45:19] the blood comes back on the cner and
[1:45:23] makes him a new creation and Paul says
[1:45:26] through the blood of Christ you have
[1:45:28] been enjoined back to God
[1:45:31] hallelujah though you never contacted
[1:45:34] the
[1:45:36] chemical amen so none of us have the
[1:45:40] chemical it's not needed the life that
[1:45:42] was in the blood comes back on The
[1:45:44] Sinner and that redeems him which is God
[1:45:47] in the form of the holy ghost that comes
[1:45:50] and lives in us and Works through us can
[1:45:55] we all say Amen to
[1:45:57] that so with the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:00] Ghost down in your soul on I want you to
[1:46:03] Rejoice over this with the baptism of
[1:46:06] the Holy Ghost down in your soul you are
[1:46:09] in a better position than if you had the
[1:46:13] physical blood in a jar and were still
[1:46:15] in
[1:46:18] sin if if I had a physical jarv his
[1:46:21] blood but I was still in sin what good
[1:46:24] does it do me brother brandom said in
[1:46:26] Rising Sun he said he rose from the dead
[1:46:28] but what's that do for me unless I can
[1:46:30] be identified in his death burial and
[1:46:34] Resurrection unless the life inside the
[1:46:36] blood can come back on me The Sinner and
[1:46:40] change me magically
[1:46:43] supernaturally change me into a new
[1:46:45] creation in Christ otherwise you're
[1:46:47] still lost I don't care what what good
[1:46:49] deed you
[1:46:51] do so from here here brother
[1:46:54] Brandon will begin to you know he'll be
[1:46:57] he'll start to put this under a
[1:46:58] magnifying glass uh of the word and
[1:47:02] he'll start to look deeper into the
[1:47:05] statement the blood is the token he
[1:47:07] starts out by saying that but we find
[1:47:10] out that he's going to put a magnifying
[1:47:12] glass and go deeper so that you get
[1:47:15] layers that give you clear understanding
[1:47:18] he's going to
[1:47:19] show how that it's not the chemistry of
[1:47:22] the blood in Jesus as it would appear on
[1:47:26] a periodic table those chemicals would
[1:47:29] your blood chemicals that make up your
[1:47:31] blood appear on the periodic table so
[1:47:33] brother brandom is going to show us that
[1:47:36] the chemistry of the blood of Jesus he
[1:47:39] had human blood and yet it was the blood
[1:47:41] of God that's the
[1:47:43] Paradox see and yet and so we find that
[1:47:47] you say well what what how how is that
[1:47:49] possible then he was half and half no he
[1:47:52] was ho and whole 100 and 100 say well
[1:47:56] that doesn't make sense
[1:47:58] correct it's not it's a paradox it's
[1:48:00] something that can't be but it is though
[1:48:05] it can't be here he goes but it
[1:48:11] is so but but it's not
[1:48:16] chemicals uh that's not the the
[1:48:18] chemistry of the blood of Jesus wouldn't
[1:48:20] do you any good brother Brandon did have
[1:48:23] value because it ran down the cross and
[1:48:25] went on the earth and just like Noah's
[1:48:27] flood baptized the Earth in the mind of
[1:48:29] God Jesus blood purchased
[1:48:31] it so it did have a value you understand
[1:48:34] but brother Ram says it's long ago dried
[1:48:36] up all right so rather than the actual
[1:48:40] chemicals that would appear on the
[1:48:42] periodic table that's not the
[1:48:44] token that's not the token rather it's
[1:48:48] the life of God that was in the blood of
[1:48:52] Jesus
[1:48:53] making him a unique human being never
[1:48:57] before seen or then or since wouldn't be
[1:49:02] necessary for someone to come like he
[1:49:03] did because now he's already paid the
[1:49:05] price and and that he died he dieth no
[1:49:08] more and he doesn't need you to to go do
[1:49:10] it see so that that life in his blood is
[1:49:16] the token that comes back on the
[1:49:18] believer for Redemption therefore
[1:49:23] in the days of Luther it was thought to
[1:49:26] believe in the days of Wesley the
[1:49:29] chemistry of the blood but this is the
[1:49:32] last day where the token is required
[1:49:36] that makes together the whole unit for
[1:49:40] the
[1:49:41] Rapture it's been the lamb all the way
[1:49:44] through brother bram's not denying that
[1:49:46] it's been the lamb all the way through
[1:49:49] it was the lamb in Luther's time it was
[1:49:52] the lamb in Wesley's time but now is the
[1:49:55] token time that each house must be
[1:49:58] covered by the token and what is the
[1:50:01] token on
[1:50:02] display the life in the blood on display
[1:50:06] that's the token on display the token is
[1:50:09] the Holy Ghost and displaying the token
[1:50:12] is displaying the Holy Ghost
[1:50:15] see so it's been the lamb all the way
[1:50:18] each house must be covered so and I I I
[1:50:23] won't get into that I see a sidebar here
[1:50:25] but we're going to we're going to stop
[1:50:26] in six
[1:50:27] minutes each
[1:50:29] house of God must be covered by the
[1:50:34] token all that's inside of it must be
[1:50:37] covered by the token and the house of
[1:50:40] God is the body of Jesus Christ and by
[1:50:43] one Spirit we're all baptized into this
[1:50:46] token and become part of it that God
[1:50:48] said when I see the token help me dis
[1:50:53] when I see the token displayed I'll pass
[1:50:57] over you brother Brandon finishes that
[1:51:00] statement and he says on the tape what
[1:51:01] an hour that we're now in oh I agree
[1:51:05] with that friends what an hour that we
[1:51:08] are now in the consummation of all the
[1:51:10] ages the thing we've waited on the thing
[1:51:13] that Paul waited on and wrote about and
[1:51:16] John wrote about and John saw it you're
[1:51:18] here you're it this is the hour and the
[1:51:21] world is gone into madness and chaos and
[1:51:25] it's it's Satan's Eden he's been voted
[1:51:27] and elected as the god of the age but
[1:51:30] there is a people who are believers of
[1:51:32] the word who have the token proudly on
[1:51:35] display as a badge of their dedication
[1:51:38] to the Lord and we're not ashamed of the
[1:51:41] gospel for it is the power of God under
[1:51:44] salvation and my only Quest is to
[1:51:47] display it more and more and more and
[1:51:50] more what is your quest today what the
[1:51:52] purpose of your
[1:51:54] life to display it more and
[1:52:00] more so it's
[1:52:03] obvious I'm watching the clock it's
[1:52:06] obvious that we've
[1:52:09] come we have
[1:52:12] arrived at a critical Tipping
[1:52:14] Point for
[1:52:19] Humanity there's been a a sea change
[1:52:23] in
[1:52:25] Christianity I want you to understand it
[1:52:27] at that
[1:52:29] level the holy
[1:52:32] spirit is impressing his prophet and
[1:52:36] drawing him to call out this end time
[1:52:40] danger and to identify it to his
[1:52:46] family I ask you today do you hear the
[1:52:51] father's voice today
[1:52:53] in the voice of a prophet I've been
[1:52:55] preaching on the voice of the East Wind
[1:52:57] and I said how is it that Pharaoh didn't
[1:53:00] hear the voice in the East Wind how is
[1:53:02] it that the world doesn't hear the
[1:53:04] judgments coming listen friends the
[1:53:06] night is far spent you understand the
[1:53:09] night is far is far spent what what once
[1:53:12] once Moses pronounced that eighth plague
[1:53:17] by morning's light Listen by morning's
[1:53:20] light it was too late for
[1:53:23] Pharaoh because the morning brought the
[1:53:26] Locust on the wind and he had heard the
[1:53:29] wind blowing all night by morning it was
[1:53:32] too late for Egypt it's blowing harder
[1:53:36] and harder we're at the dawning of a new
[1:53:38] day and I don't want it to be too late
[1:53:40] for me I don't want it to be too late
[1:53:42] for you do you hear the spirit calling
[1:53:45] to you today do you hear the voice of
[1:53:48] the East Wind do you hear the father's
[1:53:49] voice in the message of the hour saying
[1:53:52] you you must have the token on
[1:53:55] display it can't just be the what they
[1:53:58] had in the ages and a even if you have a
[1:54:00] faith in Christ that is that is aned if
[1:54:03] you refuse to have the token on
[1:54:07] display amen amen amen and

[1:55:32] great thing that you have done in this

[1:56:12] say I am a believer and I sure you could
[1:56:16] Point all day long to my mistakes but
