TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] good morning everyone god bless you let's stand and pray [Music] gracious father we come before you now and we're so thankful lord for this day of worship and entering into your word lord i pray that your holy spirit would come and meet with us lord may we each one just humble ourselves in your in your sight lord and and look to jesus christ today not looking to to a to a man to a a song leader a musician any any human being but let us draw from our by our faith unto jesus christ we know you're the same yesterday today and forever lord everything everything that you were in the past you still are today you never change lord the same supernatural god that did miracles of the past lord is the same supernatural god that lives in his people today doing the same works lord we thank you for that we we pray that you'd visit us in a special way today we ask in jesus name amen i want to speak on the topic keeping the heart and first scripture i'm going to look at is in proverbs chapter 4 verse 23 i'm just going to read it now and then we'll comment more on it later on in the sunday school so keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life amen may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated amen keep your heart with all diligence that's what we're going to talk about keeping the heart that's a that's a commandment from the lord to us by the word is that out of it are the issues of life in other words our life how we live how we act what we do starts from our heart jesus expounds upon that in the sermon on the mount and various other places in his rebukes to the pharisees and so forth um that is where our nature is that's the kind of person we are if we don't keep or guard our heart what happens is the enemy comes in the enemy works his deceit jeremiah 17 verse nine not just the enemy sometimes we are our own worst enemy many times where our own own worst enemy jeremiah 17 9 says the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it so our heart is wicked that's the nature that we're born with it's it's so bad that the word of god says who can even know the depths of the depravity and the wickedness that's in the heart of man so how do we go from there to keep your heart i know it's a simple answer is you have to be you must be born again you have to have the holy spirit dwelling inside of you to change your heart and yet we still have that nature we're never going to get rid of a sinful nature that's dwelling inside of us until we have a body change but that's that's part of what we're here for is god is changing us because he doesn't want us to be under the dominion of that sinful nature anymore the heart is desperately wicked who can know it and that continues that continues on even when the holy ghost is there but thank god there's power that we don't have to surrender to that wickedness that dwells inside of us we can overcome it we can fight against it we don't have to live under the authority of sin and the devil anymore we're set free from that so uh god god chose to work on man's heart right the devil chose to work in his mind so god works on man's heart why does he work on the heart because he knows if he changes the heart the rest of the man or woman is going to change transformation follows when god works in the heart the devil works on the mind why why does he work on the mind because he's trying to block what god is doing in the heart and out so there's a war coming on god from the inside out the devil from the outside in i wish i had a uh uh illustration oops i don't know what happened there but get me back up brother josh um you know you have the the three the the soul the spirit and the body so if you if you look further brother branham tells us that that's not just heart it's the soul that is the control tower god wants to work from the soul as the control tower so you have the soul it's either faith or unbelief from the soul then you have the spirit which is memory conscience reason affection imagination okay so those are inlets those are inlets actually they go both directions you contact through your flesh you contact the earth from your from your mind your mind contacts the earth through your flesh your your soul is contacted through those inlets as well so it goes both directions so you see what i'm saying with god is working from a transformed soul to change those other inlets so that he is manifested out through your mind to your body into the world the devil wants to stop that he doesn't want that to happen so what does he do he those are also inlets going down so he works on memory conscience reason affection imagination so there's there's that battle taking place right there so what are you governed by what what is governing you the outside in or the inside out because you can be you can be a christian and go to church and still be governed from the outside going in and you're living and operating in unbelief because that's what's ultimately what satan wants to get the soul condition to be is unbelief god's purpose of the soul condition is faith because faith changes everything faith changes how we interact with this in this earth so as believers of course we're sealed by the holy ghost the devil can't get in to reside in our hearts but he certainly can come through those inlets to impact our faith uh he wants to he wants to go from a fully operational faith to a faith that's like down in some crevice of the soul that's not even hardly operating it's just operating enough to go to church maybe and say that you believe that's that's wonderful that's a great start but god wants the whole your whole body soul and spirit to be cleansed and operating under faith he doesn't just want faith in your soul he wants faith in your mind he wants faith operating through your body the devil wants to put that in a corner that he can't take that away from you once you're sealed he can never take faith away from you but he can make it in opera in inoperable and that's the great danger and that's why we have to keep our heart let's just look at a few scriptures go quickly through them and god god saw that the wickedness is a genesis 6 5 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually again god goes directly to the problem the thoughts of their heart the thoughts of their heart are evil continually they're under the dominion of evil and what is happening on the earth because of the hearts of man evil evil is passing passing around everywhere psalm 119 34 give me understanding and i shall keep thy law yea i shall observe it with my whole heart now you're seeing a little bit of a different meaning here whole heart is is you're speaking of your strength of your you're gonna dedicate yourself from the very inmost of your being to observe the law the law of god numbers 15 39 and it shall be unto you for a fringe that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and that you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes after which you used to go a whoring seek not after your own heart what do we hear all the time today on social media follow your just if you just follow your heart everything will be all right everything will be all right for the devil if you follow your heart it's absolutely true we were speaking in the men's breakfast yesterday what is what does satan do does he come and say i want to be your master i would like to be your master will you surrender to me uh no thanks no he says i i would like for you to have self-autonomy i would like for you to have freedom to do as you'd like to do and to exalt yourself what did he do what did he do he deceived his own heart in the beginning right what did he do he said i will ascend i will be like the most high what did he do he did the same thing to eve he said if you eat this fruit you'll be like god knowing good and evil so he deceived himself and then he deceived eve doing what not he he didn't offer himself as a master what did he do he offered himself he offered freedom you have freedom to choose you have self you have self-deciding governance i think that's the greatest thing that young people are going through in their minds is i want to decide for myself i want self-autonomy do you know that here's a fact there's no such thing there's no such thing as self-autonomy you're either under the the lordship of satan or the lordship of jesus christ there's not in between the freedom that satan is offering is under his mastership his lordship he is under control a person that say i i want freedom i want to live any way i want to i want to make my own choices oh my the devil has been talking in your ear what are you thinking why would a christian think like that if you're a christian you don't ne you don't ever and you don't never want to make your own choices you don't want to make your own decisions you don't want to establish your own will you want to follow the leadership of the holy spirit we don't seek after our own heart and our own eyes because when we do that what are we doing following the way of the devil following our own way is not following our own way it's following satanic leadership and it brings destruction it might bring you prosperity it might make you rich but it brings soul crushing destruction your own way don't don't ever get young people that are in here don't ever think choosing your own way is your own way that's that's false doctrine there's god's way or there's the devil's way oh it's not it's it's more complicated than that brother jason no it's not more complicated than that it's a it's an absolute scriptural fact all right deuteronomy 4 9 only take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen unless they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sons sons don't let the word don't let the word manifested depart from your heart and from your mind another take heed to yourself keep your soul diligently in other words there's an effort that goes into this there's diligence that goes into this there's a process that goes into this it doesn't just happen just like the snap of a finger there's something that we have to do as empowered sons and daughters of god that have the holy ghost that have a changed nature there's something that we have to do to keep us in the right position before god there's proverbs 4 23 once again keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life so looking at this that word keep means to guard protect or maintain diligence the word diligence is actually a different word for guard but it's actually speaking of a prison or a garrison a place of protection keep your it's guard your heart with all guarding it's like doubling up in a different uh tense of the word so in other words do you really have to do this you have to put effort you have to put strength you have to put focus on keeping your ho your heart guard your heart your eyes your mind be careful what you look at what you listen to what you consider to be true keep your conscience free from guilt do you know that you can do that you can keep your conscience free from guilt i didn't say free from sin i said free from guilt why because there's a cleansing blood all you have to do is go all you have to do is ask all you have to do says lord forgive me i repent you don't have to hold you don't have to take pride in your sin and hold on to it and say i need this and i need to protect this who gave you that thinking that you have to protect yourself because there's sin in your life no you don't it's not about an image it's about being right with god make sure you know where your affections are set are they set on things of the earth or are they set on things above are we seeking the will of god constantly are we just kind of going forward however we want to go forward whatever we think is best again that's not the heart of a child of god we're we should always be in a position of desperation seeking to know the mind of the lord always should be in that position so again our heart is naturally deceitful so we have to keep our eyes out you know you think of the old days when people were settling across america and they would come and settle in a place and they knew there was danger all around so what did they do they built they built up walls but not only they built up walls then they put a little place for people to watch out watch out and keep and that's really what this is basically saying here is build a guard around you build a garrison around you and then keep watch keep keep watch keep looking the enemy's coming the enemy's coming here he's coming from this direction you have to set up a guard you have to you have to protect him don't let him come in don't even let him get close push him back satan is the bible says he's a mighty hunter right seeking whom he may devour so how necessary it is is it for us to keep a guard keep a watch and be on the lookout for him to come in unfortunately too many times we're looking out and say oh look at that handsome fellow why didn't you come in we do that to ourselves oh yeah we we many times deceive ourselves and say okay that's fine this is no problem i can allow this in my life i can act this way it's not it doesn't hurt anything no that's going to be your destruction all right so then i guess the question comes is how do we do that that's real nice that you're saying we have to do that but how do i go about doing that what's the process what does it look like for me on a daily basis to begin to keep my keep my heart well the way it's the way that scripture is saying it's telling us to keep our heart like it's only up to us is it only up to us thank the lord it's not only up to us it isn't the lord the lord promises to keep us he's he's a shepherd he's our shepherd and he will keep us and there's no one that can pluck us out of his hands there's no one that has the power to do that and yet there still is that commandment to us we have to exert our will our energies our own our power all that we are into this we are supposed to do what love the lord with all our heart all our soul all our mind and all our strength so in keeping our heart we have to do the same exact thing all right brother branham says i think okay yeah he says and it won't work no selfish thing will work your motives and objectives have to be exactly perfectly right then you have faith to ask if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence see see we've got to have confidence i want this to the honor and glory of god then have faith a channel to move into if it doesn't then you've got mental intellectual faith and not genuine faith from god so here what is he saying he's what i'm and what how is this connect to what i'm talking about it's your motive in your objective many times we want to do the right thing but for the wrong reasons we are our heart motive is different than what god wants our heart motive to be and that we have to go into that place where we are in prayer saying lord search my heart look at what my motive is it's not just well i want to do the right thing because mom and dad will be disappointed no we got to go way beyond that we got to go way beyond that when you're little that might be fine but if you're in this uh sunday school you got to be a little advent more advanced right where you're not thinking well mom you know mom will look at me and be upset or the pastor will be upset no it's you truly who you are in christ who are you who has god made you to be and what is my motive what is my purpose what is my objective in life because if your motive is wrong your heart is wrong psalm 4 3 and 4 but know that the lord has set apart him that is godly for himself the lord will hear when you call unto him stand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still i think every time i read this it's so interesting we always talk about communing with the lord but this scripture is telling to commune with your own heart i think i think that's what we're talking about is you're seeking the lord your motive your objective your purpose you're consid you're you're taking time to sit to be still to to feel the greatness of the lord i mean that's what it says the lord will hear when i call unto him stand in awe stand in us so there there is a a place in your quiet place in your secret place where you come and say lord i just want to be in your presence i want to be in awe of you and then when you come to that place don't don't he says sin not but then he says commune with your own heart so what does that mean consider your own life how many times take time just be quiet consider your own life consider your own actions am i speaking the right thing do i have the right attitude do i have the right approach is my heart full of pride or am i am i am i being humble am i walking in in godliness am i praying enough consider your own life i think this is what we're talking about here commune with your own heart upon your bed but thank god it's you're not alone because the presence of god is there and you can say lord search my heart and reveal to me the things that i'm missing what's what's so amazing is how blind we can be to our own faults to our own weaknesses oh my goodness we see so easily the pride of other people we were talking about yesterday brothers you you easily see the pride of others well that's a dangerous thing because if you easily recognize the pride of others it means you and you're upset by it it means you've got pride inside of you the faster you're offended by someone who has who's a prideful person is means that you're in a condition of having pride in your own heart and so that's a that's a danger and we and we don't do that we just we go a long life and we don't think about what's wrong in my heart what's wrong what's what do i have in my life that isn't right with the lord instead of just going on and living and saying well i'm fine i'm doing good i'm doing my best no that's not what we're talking about we're talking about searching your own heart and spending time with god and asking him to show you i mean do any of us want to be walking in a wrong heart in disobedience in rebellion against god i hope not i hope you don't want to so let's take time you know when we pray just to be still and ask the holy spirit to search our hearts and search our lives for ourselves i mean i've i've had to do that a lot lately seeing seeing wrong motives wrong objectives in my own in my own heart and having to repent and saying i'm i'm not right i haven't been right all right this is from 1955 the faith that was once delivered to the saints brother branham says now we wish to turn into the scriptures just for a few moments of meditations on the bible i love the word oh i just wished i could express it you know where i preach my best sermons in my prayer room at home or somewhere in the bed i lay at night time and get anointed with the holy spirit i preach a half a night to myself oh if i could just do it like that in the pulpit but i get too quick too fast and a little bit i run ahead of myself oh if i could just do it like that in the pulpit but i get too quick uh too fast i guess that's because of being nervous and kind of lose my thought but excuse me it'd be too close that it's a good voice i don't you like to get alone with the lord my my just be alone there's sometimes we used to sing a little song sometimes i like to be all alone with christ my lord do you ever hear it i can tell him all my troubles all alone and that's the way he wants to get you alone to himself your prayers not so much as when you're all maybe coming you know for instance be well out in the public when you're praying like in church or on the altar get alone you'll pray a different prayer when you're by yourself than you do when you're in the public slip alone all of you go out and just have a real secret meeting place where you and the lord meet several times a day and pray amen this is where this is where living a victorious life starts you know i think of how brother branham you know he'd go he'd go out into the wilderness and go out into the woods and and go and pray but it was his constant thing in life was he was finding a place to be alone with the lord he would go to this place and go for a nice hike in the woods or in the mountains but what was his real purpose not the hike not the woods it was to be with the lord and i i think we should be in that in that condition in our hearts that we're constantly thinking okay when can i get alone with god when can i go pray we want we want to see god's power in our life we want to see him more manifested i believe it starts right there you know i i'm as i'm saying this it's coming to my mind well i don't even have a desire for that not i'm not saying for myself but maybe somebody's i don't even desire for that i just want to be with my friends i just want to hang out i just want to do this that's great i know i was in that condition one time too but god can change your heart to desire the right things you you want to have a good life you want to have a powerful life you want to have a meaningful life this is where it starts is being a person that spends time alone with god to meet several times a day and pray whenever that's one of the things that i think stands out to me whenever i go through the supernatural series about brother branham's life over and over again he's constantly finding oh okay where is brother branham i don't know he's gone find out later he was off praying somewhere and lord that's what i want to have i want that drive in my heart that it drives me to that place where i'm going i'm wanting to go to pray not not wanting to go and watch the next movie not wanting to go watch the next television show not wanting to just oh i got to just check out in my mind and do do the infinite scroll on facebook but that i set that all aside and say i have a passion a desire to pray matthew 6 5 and 6 this should be our main prayer and when thou prayest thou shall not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly jesus goes through that several this same thought with different subjects in the sermon on the mount what do we do what are we what are what is the motive of our heart is it to be seen by people is it to be seen in a certain position in a certain place and people will look at this is religious motives right here what is your motive of your heart if your motive of your heart is to be seen by people and you're seen by people what do you have you have the reward that you wanted but the motive in the heart should to be see god moving in your life in other people's life and if that's the reward that you're looking for god moving in people's lives then don't do things to be seen by people do it to get a lot to go and go in secret do what god wants you to do in secret and let him work openly in front of the people you know that that should be our main all of us as christians not just the preacher not just someone who's never preaches and never does anything in the church that shouldn't matter the best thing you can do for the believers around you is to pray for them and to really have that burden of heart to pray for them if you never preach a sermon if you never lead anything in the church ever if you never reach become a deacon if you if you don't do a thing all you do is come to church if you if you pray for people you're doing the best thing that any of us could do because when when a real believer prays god enters into those prayers and he begins to work in people's lives we know this we know this this is nothing new to any of us this is a reminder for me when i when i went and picked this topic it's something that i've spoken about in the past other places and put together a little differently this time but
