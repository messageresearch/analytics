[36:20] stilled the people before Moses and said
[36:23] let us go up at once and possess it for
[36:27] we are well able to overcome it amen and
[36:31] we're going to turn into the Book of
[36:32] Matthew Matthew's gospel the 14th
[36:35] chapter Matthew
[36:38] 14 and then starting at verse
[36:42] 22 thanks
[36:44] bro all right it says uh starting at
[36:47] verse 22 Matthew 14 it says and straight
[36:50] way Jesus constrained his disciples to
[36:53] get into a ship and to go before him
[36:55] under the other side while he sent the
[36:58] multitudes away and when he sent the
[37:00] multitudes away he went up into a
[37:02] mountain apart to pray and then when the
[37:04] evening was come he was there alone but
[37:07] the ship was now
[37:09] tossed but the ship was now in the midst
[37:11] of the sea tossed with waves for the
[37:14] wind was contrary and in the Fourth
[37:16] Watch of the night Jesus went unto them
[37:18] walking on the
[37:19] sea and when the disciples saw him
[37:23] walking on the sea they were troubled
[37:24] saying it is a spirit and they cried out
[37:26] for fear
[37:28] but straightway Jesus spoke unto them
[37:30] saying be of good cheer it is I Be not
[37:32] Afraid and Peter answered and said Lord
[37:35] if it be thou bid me to come on come
[37:38] unto thee on the water and he said come
[37:41] and when Peter was come down out of the
[37:43] ship he walked down on the water to go
[37:45] to Jesus and when he saw the wind
[37:48] boisterous he was afraid and beginning
[37:50] to sink he cried out saying Lord save me
[37:53] and immediately Jesus stretched forth
[37:55] his hand and caught him and said unto
[37:56] him oh oh thou of little faith wherefore
[37:59] did thou doubt and when they were come
[38:01] into the the ship the wind
[38:04] ceased then they that were in the ship
[38:07] came and worshiped him saying of a truth
[38:10] Thou Art the Son of God Amen and let's
[38:13] turn into one more portion of scripture
[38:14] it's the last chapter in the book of
[38:16] Luke Luke chap
[38:19] 24 Luke chapter 24 we're just going to
[38:22] read three verses this is the story of
[38:25] the two disci disciples that were on the
[38:27] road to Emmas this is just a portion of
[38:29] it that I wanted to catch Chap 24:
[38:33] 28-31 and they drew n The Village
[38:36] whether they went and he made as though
[38:38] he would have gone further but they
[38:41] constrained him saying abide with us for
[38:44] it is toward evening and the day is far
[38:47] spent and he went in to T with him and
[38:51] it came to pass as he sat at meat with
[38:53] them he took bread and blessed it and
[38:56] break and gave it to them them and their
[38:58] eyes were open and they knew him and he
[39:01] vanished out of their sight amen I'd

[39:33] we love you now and we commit it unto
[39:35] you in the name of Jesus Christ amen God
[39:38] bless you this this evening as you take
[39:39] your seat saints of God just to set a
[39:41] foundation here this evening so the
[39:44] first one that we read there in the Book
[39:45] of Numbers The Numbers Chapter 13 and 14
[39:48] this point in Israel's history it came
[39:51] time for the Israelites to spy out their
[39:53] land of promise amen it it to spy out
[39:56] the land that God had promised to them
[39:59] this was right after Kadesh barnea and
[40:01] if you remember when all these other
[40:03] spies gave their testimony they said
[40:06] that there was no way that they could
[40:07] possess the land they saw amen the enemy
[40:11] was just too great the men that they
[40:13] would have to fight were giants they
[40:15] were outnumbered they said the cities
[40:17] are walled and too great for them to
[40:20] overtake amen they saw the amalekites
[40:22] there amen that was the enemy that first
[40:24] came against them when they when they
[40:26] went into out of Egypt they saw the
[40:28] jebusites and they saw the amorites but
[40:30] the Bible says that Caleb stilled the
[40:33] people he says let us go up at once to
[40:36] possess it for we are well able to
[40:38] overcome it he but he said it in this
[40:41] way with haste he said let us go up at
[40:43] once Amen in other words we ought to
[40:45] make Cas with the word that God gives us
[40:48] amen we can't sit around and wait until
[40:51] the devil starts flooding us with mind
[40:53] battles saying that we can't do it amen
[40:56] we got to take the word from the Lord
[40:58] and attack at once amen we will overcome
[41:02] Saints but the other men that were with
[41:04] them they said they're stronger than we
[41:07] and I want you to notice this here their
[41:09] testimony wasn't wrong the Israelites
[41:12] were the weaker party they they didn't
[41:14] have the training that that the other
[41:16] that these enemies had you know most of
[41:19] them spent their lives in bondage in
[41:21] Egypt and God had been the one fighting
[41:23] all their battles for him anyway but
[41:25] their problem was was what they were
[41:27] looking at amen their testimony was now
[41:30] watch this in numbers 13:33 it says and
[41:34] there we saw giants the sons of anoch
[41:37] which came of the Giants and we were in
[41:40] our own sight as grap Grasshoppers and
[41:43] so we were in their sight so often times
[41:46] Saints I believe that the enemy gets us
[41:49] looking at ourselves through the wrong
[41:51] lens they were looking at themselves
[41:54] through the lens of their enemy amen
[41:56] through the Viewpoint of their enemy we
[41:59] are to look at everything that we Face
[42:02] amen a as a through the Viewpoint of the
[42:07] word that's what Caleb and Joshua said
[42:09] they said we will overcome amen but
[42:12] their eyes were on God's word not on
[42:15] their own abilities amen if you go back
[42:18] and you read the story you know the
[42:20] Israelites were afraid because of the
[42:22] testimony of the other spies that went
[42:24] with Caleb and Joshua remember Moses
[42:26] spent sent 12 12 Spies to spy out the
[42:28] land amen and the entire rest of the
[42:31] Israelites over a million Jews they
[42:34] listen to the testimony of the majority
[42:38] amen they listen to the testimony of
[42:41] those 10 other spies you see what the
[42:43] power of your testimony can do in life
[42:47] they were relying saints of God they
[42:49] were relying on 12 brave men to come
[42:53] back and say that we can overcome this
[42:56] land they were relying on the courage of
[42:59] those men who went out before them to
[43:02] say that we can do this and when two of
[43:05] them said that they held to the
[43:07] testimony of the majority amen they were
[43:10] relying on the wrong thing you know
[43:12] instead fear drove them to to keep
[43:15] wandering in that Wilderness out of the
[43:17] land of of Promise amen they held to the
[43:20] wrong thing in one of the most famous
[43:23] quotes on The Art of War it says every
[43:27] battle is won or lost before it's ever
[43:31] fought saints of God never forget that
[43:35] you are fighting a war we fight against
[43:38] principalities we fight against Powers
[43:41] against spiritual wickedness in high
[43:42] places and the prophet makes that
[43:44] statement to say we have a worthy
[43:46] adversary amen he knows how to fight he
[43:49] knows where to attack he knows your
[43:52] weaknesses and it can get you
[43:54] discouraged sometimes amen it matters
[43:58] how you prepare for battle amen
[44:00] preparation is crucial Churchill said it
[44:03] like this when Britain Was preparing for
[44:06] possible Nazi invasion he said we shall
[44:09] fight on the Seas and oceans we shall
[44:12] fight with confidence we shall fight
[44:15] with strength in the air we shall defend
[44:18] our Island whatever the cost may be amen
[44:21] we shall fight on the beaches we shall
[44:24] fight on the grounds we shall fight in
[44:26] the field and in the streets we shall
[44:29] fight in the hills and we shall Never
[44:32] Surrender amen saints of God to be
[44:34] strong and courageous because we shall
[44:37] Never Surrender amen we are given a
[44:40] promise that we will possess everything
[44:43] that our foot Treads upon amen we are
[44:46] given a promise that we will overcome by
[44:49] the word of Our Testimony and the blood
[44:51] of the Lamb that was already shed on
[44:53] Calvary for you amen you know we can
[44:56] suff suffer losses along the way you
[44:59] know travail may come and it may
[45:01] overwhelm us but glory to God Saints we
[45:04] shall Never Surrender am you know I
[45:06] think sometimes you know as as as
[45:09] Believers I believe we just need to have
[45:11] a good oldfashioned courage conference
[45:13] amen I believe that we need to get like
[45:15] they did in Acts 4 that's exactly what
[45:18] they needed they were discouraged at the
[45:20] happenings of the day amen so what did
[45:22] they do they got all together in one
[45:24] Accord in a little Wednesday night G
[45:27] Gathering because they were discouraged
[45:28] at the happenings of the day and they
[45:30] forgot about their trials they forgot
[45:33] about their their their problems they
[45:34] forgot about tomorrow and today and they
[45:37] focused on the word of God they focused
[45:40] how we can overcome they focused on what
[45:43] we need to do right now
[45:45] amen and what did it do the power of God
[45:48] shook amen I believe that the Bible is
[45:51] specific with things it says that the
[45:53] power of God shook that building
[45:55] amen they had a refilling of the spirit
[45:58] of God they had a courage conference
[46:00] amen and it gave them strength amen one

[46:21] completely hopeless but their family's
[46:23] lives were at stake amen Arnold van
[46:26] Winkler stepped out and

[57:43] it was the moabites they they were
[57:45] afraid of this enemy that he was going
[57:47] to conquer all three of their armies and
[57:49] they had an incredible need not only for
[57:53] winning the battle but they also had a
[57:55] great need for provisions and for water
[57:57] amen they were in the desert with their
[58:00] cattle and their armies and they needed
[58:02] those things so what did they do they
[58:04] inquired of the lord of the prophet in
[58:06] the in the land at the time Elisha you
[58:08] know and at first Elisha began calling
[58:11] them out for their years of idolatry but
[58:14] it was the king of Judah at the time was
[58:16] Jehoshaphat and he was a righteous man
[58:19] and honored the Lord so so Elisha sought
[58:22] Counsel on his behalf amen
[58:29] Lord the Bible says that the word of the
[58:32] Lord comes to the prophet amen so
[58:34] there's a vital importance as we catch
[58:37] this story don't miss this there's a
[58:39] vital importance in obedience to the
[58:42] word of the Lord just the way that he
[58:43] says it amen we can't emphasize that
[58:46] enough it's the difference espe even in
[58:48] a story like this but in your life it's
[58:50] the difference between life and
[58:54] death and the inquire Ed of the Lord the
[58:57] our Prophet inquired of the Lord and
[58:59] what was his command empty
[59:01] out the word that came from the Lord in
[59:04] Second Kings was make this Valley full
[59:06] of ditches and this entire Valley is
[59:09] going to be filled with water and not
[59:12] only will your Provisions be met but you
[59:16] will defeat the Army but catch the
[59:19] Saints there was a work for them to do
[59:22] there was a work for them to do they had
[59:24] a task at hand brother said that the
[59:26] main principle was to prepare for the
[59:30] water to come and to get the ditches dug
[59:33] out you see God is going to move in your
[59:36] life amen he is going to overcome
[59:39] everything that you have need of Amen
[59:41] he's going to provide the word he's
[59:43] going to provide the provisions amen but
[59:45] he needs you to do some digging amen he
[59:48] need you to start digging things out of
[59:50] your life amen he needs to start having
[59:52] you expose yourself to God expose your
[59:55] weaknesses expose your flaws expose
[59:58] those besetting things and give it to
[1:00:00] the Lord Jesus
[1:00:04] Hallelujah we've got to make ready for
[1:00:06] the water to
[1:00:10] come Matthew 7 s says ask and it shall
[1:00:15] be given seek and you shall find knock
[1:00:20] and it shall be opened up unto you I
[1:00:22] want this to be so clear you can start
[1:00:24] spiritually digging in your life if
[1:00:27] there a if there is a desire there
[1:00:30] Isaiah says seek the Lord while he may
[1:00:33] be found if you just need more of God in
[1:00:35] your life pursue them if you feel like
[1:00:38] you need the Holy Ghost pursue them if
[1:00:40] you feel like you need victory in a
[1:00:42] situation pursue them amen whatever you
[1:00:45] have need of I could sit up here and
[1:00:47] list everything whatever you have need
[1:00:48] of pursue him
[1:00:53] amen Matthew Matthew's uh go goel says
[1:00:57] if a son ask bread of any of you that is
[1:01:00] that is that is a father will you give
[1:01:02] him a stone or if he ask a fish will he
[1:01:05] give a fish for a serpent if he ask for
[1:01:07] an egg will he give him a scorpion if
[1:01:09] then being evil know how to give give
[1:01:14] good gifts unto your children how much
[1:01:16] more your heavenly father to give the
[1:01:19] Holy Spirit to them that ask for it how
[1:01:22] much more amen you have a little child
[1:01:24] and they come up to you ask you
[1:01:26] Oh Daddy can I have this can I have this
[1:01:29] and you want to give that to him it's
[1:01:30] the desire of your heart to do whatever
[1:01:33] it is that they need amen how much more
[1:01:36] the heavenly father that created that
[1:01:39] little child and created the emotions
[1:01:42] that were involved in that child and
[1:01:44] created you and created your emotions
[1:01:46] how much more your heavenly father wants
[1:01:49] to give you the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:52] Ghost so that you can have a constant
[1:01:54] communion with him at all times amen how
[1:01:58] much more glory to
[1:02:00] God but you see friends it's a two-fold
[1:02:03] process that takes place you see when
[1:02:06] you get a shovel and and you start
[1:02:08] digging into the ground you start
[1:02:10] running to the things that a shovel just
[1:02:13] isn't going to work against anymore but
[1:02:16] you see what you're doing is you're
[1:02:18] exposing those areas in your life that
[1:02:22] need a little bit of something stronger
[1:02:24] to dig it out amen you're you're digging
[1:02:27] and you're digging and digging I hate
[1:02:29] digging it is it is backbreaking but it
[1:02:32] it takes energy it takes something you
[1:02:35] putting something into it amen and then
[1:02:37] once you get to something that you know
[1:02:39] a shovel isn't going to handle guess
[1:02:41] what the Holy Ghost can handle it amen
[1:02:43] the Holy Ghost will come into your life
[1:02:45] into whatever situation into the hardest
[1:02:48] things into the most intricate places
[1:02:50] and he'll take the Holy Ghost machinery
[1:02:52] and he'll dig that thing out and it's
[1:02:54] not even going to just be an empty hole
[1:02:56] in your life anymore it's going to be
[1:02:58] filled now with something that you
[1:03:00] didn't even had know you needed it's
[1:03:02] going to be exceedingly abundantly more
[1:03:05] than you could have ever asked or
[1:03:06] thought amen isn't that what his word
[1:03:08] said
[1:03:13] Hallelujah Saints you start digging into
[1:03:15] areas in your life you're going to start
[1:03:18] digging into some bigger Roots we had
[1:03:20] that sermon of rooting for the
[1:03:23] Rapture our brother you know you're
[1:03:25] going to start digging into
[1:03:26] indifferences in your life towards going
[1:03:29] to church you're going to start digging
[1:03:30] into indifferences in your life towards
[1:03:33] your brothers or your sisters you're
[1:03:35] you're going to even worse you're going
[1:03:37] to start digging into ditches about your
[1:03:38] Christian walk that maybe you it's just
[1:03:41] in a stagnant place in your life
[1:03:44] indifference toward the word of God
[1:03:46] you're going to start digging into
[1:03:48] things that you won't be able to uproot
[1:03:50] on your on your own but God isn't
[1:03:52] looking for you to do all the work amen
[1:03:55] right
[1:03:56] he just needs you to surrender that
[1:03:57] thing to him and he'll do the rest you
[1:04:00] expose your weaknesses to him
[1:04:03] amen and Saints don't don't let the
[1:04:06] devil keep that thing hidden in your
[1:04:08] heart don't let Pride come in and keep
[1:04:11] you from overcoming that thing you can't
[1:04:14] hide anything from God he knows
[1:04:18] everything you have need of amen he
[1:04:20] already knows amen don't hide those
[1:04:22] things from God he'll do his part amen
[1:04:26] he just needs you to open up to
[1:04:28] him the prophet says it like this
[1:04:30] there's coming a gusher if you'll get
[1:04:33] ready for it but if you don't make ready
[1:04:36] you'll never see it I want to see it
[1:04:40] Saints he said he said lay aside
[1:04:42] everything that so easily beset you he
[1:04:45] he he says I don't do nothing and you
[1:04:46] know he's just talking with himself and
[1:04:48] he says you know maybe that's what's the
[1:04:50] matter that's the trouble of it it's
[1:04:52] more sin not to do than it is to do good
[1:04:54] and know better that's he said he that
[1:04:56] knoweth to do good and knoweth and doeth
[1:04:58] it not to him it's a sin you've got to
[1:05:00] make ready doing nothing is the worst
[1:05:03] that you can do he says we got to start
[1:05:06] digging those things out of our life
[1:05:08] amen we know the water is going to come
[1:05:11] I love that story there in in Second
[1:05:13] Kings because God uses that Supernatural
[1:05:16] means and he says but this is just a
[1:05:20] light thing in the sight of the Lord
[1:05:22] that's where that scripture comes from
[1:05:23] this is just a light thing in the sight
[1:05:26] of the Lord you know we get caught in
[1:05:27] our human understanding of things often
[1:05:30] times just like the spies did there at
[1:05:32] Kadesh barnea their natural eyes were
[1:05:34] beholding something that it it was
[1:05:36] impossible I you we can't beat all these
[1:05:39] enemies we know that they've got better
[1:05:41] equipment and and all this stuff it's
[1:05:43] it's just better but they were looking
[1:05:45] at the wrong thing our eyes look at our
[1:05:49] understanding and we start to try to
[1:05:51] measure things but God doesn't see
[1:05:53] things the way that we see him amen
[1:05:55] there isn't anything too hard for the
[1:05:57] Lord 2 Corinthians 4:18 says while we
[1:06:00] look not at the things which are seen
[1:06:02] But at the things which are not seen for
[1:06:05] the things which are seen are temporal
[1:06:07] but the things which are not seen are
[1:06:09] Eternal brother random says it like this
[1:06:12] everything that's Everlasting everything
[1:06:15] that's real is unscientifically proved
[1:06:18] the whole armor of God is completely
[1:06:21] Supernatural amen love joy peace
[1:06:25] longsuffering goodness meekness
[1:06:28] gentleness patience Faith every armor of
[1:06:31] Christianity is
[1:06:34] Supernatural that then why shouldn't we
[1:06:36] believe in the Supernatural things if
[1:06:39] the entire of the armor of the Christian
[1:06:41] faith is Supernatural we look at the SE
[1:06:43] at the Unseen not at what we see
[1:06:45] everything we see is perishable it comes
[1:06:48] from the Earth but we look at things we
[1:06:51] do not see and by faith we believe it
[1:06:55] amen
[1:06:56] in another place speaking on faith for
[1:06:58] just a moment the five senses only
[1:07:01] contact this world if you had no feeling
[1:07:05] then you couldn't feel nothing feeling
[1:07:07] wouldn't be nothing to you that would be
[1:07:10] another world if you had no sight what
[1:07:12] you look at would be another world you
[1:07:14] know nothing about it so these five
[1:07:15] senses is the only thing that God let us
[1:07:18] lose to but there is another one called
[1:07:21] Faith but by faith you walk up a ladder
[1:07:25] and finally get so high until you break
[1:07:28] into another world which is called
[1:07:31] Vision there you can see it amen just
[1:07:34] like if you'd never known what was this
[1:07:36] that you was feeling with your sense of
[1:07:37] feeling or you never seen it then your
[1:07:40] eyes come open you could see it it' all
[1:07:41] be a mystery to that person who could
[1:07:43] never see it'd be a mystery to him but
[1:07:46] yet that's it amen so so you see their
[1:07:49] faith was that they had to trust in thus
[1:07:54] sayeth the Lord from the their Prophet
[1:07:56] it was God's command dig the ditches and
[1:07:58] it seemed kind of ridiculous but they
[1:08:01] started digging and they started walking
[1:08:03] up that ladder amen until they got so
[1:08:06] high that it broke into another world
[1:08:08] which was Vision amen you know and
[1:08:11] that's what Caleb started doing he
[1:08:12] started walking up that ladder it
[1:08:14] started as simply a word from God Amen
[1:08:17] but he took God at his word and even
[1:08:20] when his eyes deceived him even when it
[1:08:23] looked impossible his Faith wasn't
[1:08:26] looking at the Natural Things amen the
[1:08:28] other men's were their their senses were
[1:08:31] looking at the natural things sometimes
[1:08:34] our natural senses can deceive us our
[1:08:37] emotions in a matter can deceive us amen
[1:08:40] but I promise that word will never fail
[1:08:44] amen I promise that word will never
[1:08:47] deceive us amen if you keep on reading
[1:08:50] God met that two-fold need with one
[1:08:53] command
[1:08:57] I just love this you know when the when
[1:08:58] the moabites started heading toward the
[1:09:01] camp the Bible says that it was morning
[1:09:04] time and that the glow of the sunshine
[1:09:07] just hit the water oh praise God there's
[1:09:09] something special about the rising of
[1:09:11] the Sun the glow off of the sun started
[1:09:15] hitting that water and the and it mixed
[1:09:17] from from the Sun to to the water and it
[1:09:20] caused a
[1:09:22] mirage the the enemy they thought that
[1:09:24] all three armies had turned on each
[1:09:26] other that they had defeated each other
[1:09:28] so they went in completely unprepared
[1:09:30] just ready to take the spoils amen they
[1:09:32] didn't they weren't prepared with their
[1:09:34] with their weapons they weren't prepared
[1:09:35] to fight they thought that they had
[1:09:37] turned against each other because they
[1:09:38] were deceived in their mind thinking
[1:09:40] that the battle had already been fought
[1:09:43] amen see sometimes saints of God the
[1:09:45] very thing that we just need to start
[1:09:48] doing in our life is the very thing that
[1:09:50] God is going to use to deceive our enemy
[1:09:52] amen it's the very thing that God need
[1:09:55] you to do just start digging just start
[1:09:56] taking my word for it just start
[1:09:58] emptying things out of your life amen
[1:10:00] I'm going to pour out the water and then
[1:10:02] when that water comes one day the
[1:10:04] resurrection morning will come and the
[1:10:06] enemy will think he had you but he
[1:10:08] didn't and he will be defeated amen
[1:10:12] hallelujah he thinks you won't survive
[1:10:14] it but in reality God is going to
[1:10:17] destroy your enemy the Bible says they
[1:10:19] overcame by the blood of the lamb and
[1:10:21] the word of their testimony amen and one
[1:10:24] day you're going to have a testimony
[1:10:26] that that you went through such and such
[1:10:28] or you did this and yes it hurt and
[1:10:30] maybe sometimes it felt like you
[1:10:32] couldn't go on maybe sometimes you felt
[1:10:34] like it was over maybe sometimes you got
[1:10:35] into a situation you feel like you
[1:10:37] couldn't cross over you couldn't
[1:10:38] overcome this
[1:10:41] thing feel like had victory in this
[1:10:43] situation Hallelujah but saints of God
[1:10:46] there's a plan in all of it it'll be the
[1:10:48] word of your testimony it'll be the word
[1:10:51] of your testimony that defeats the enemy
[1:10:54] amen
[1:10:55] God has a plan in all of
[1:10:58] it but listen Saints had they not
[1:11:01] followed the command from the prophet to
[1:11:04] dig those ditches the water would have
[1:11:06] had no place to
[1:11:08] go and the Very way that God was
[1:11:12] planning to defeat the enemy with it
[1:11:14] wouldn't have happened because they
[1:11:16] didn't take God at his word
[1:11:18] amen you've got to open up your hearts
[1:11:21] and take that step of Faith listen to
[1:11:22] this you know we can look several
[1:11:25] thousands and I made and I made some of
[1:11:26] these notes I took from my Sunday school
[1:11:28] so if you're hearing it for the second
[1:11:30] time praise
[1:11:32] God we we can look several thousand
[1:11:35] years later and and understand why it
[1:11:38] happened the way that it did amen
[1:11:40] because we have the full picture but at
[1:11:42] that time they weren't given the full
[1:11:44] picture they weren't they weren't told
[1:11:46] by God that look you got to dig these
[1:11:49] ditches because water's going to flow
[1:11:51] and then I'm going to cause the sun to
[1:11:53] rise and then the sun's going to shine
[1:11:55] on the water and it's going to cause the
[1:11:57] enemy to be deceived and then the enem
[1:11:58] is going to come in and then they're
[1:12:00] going to just destroy each other you're
[1:12:01] going to you're going to pursue your
[1:12:03] enemy because when they went into their
[1:12:05] Camp the Israel pursued them when they
[1:12:08] just needed help in defeating them they
[1:12:10] needed help in defending them God ended
[1:12:12] up turning that around and the you
[1:12:14] pursue your enemy amen they pursued
[1:12:17] their
[1:12:18] enemy glory to God God has a plan in all
[1:12:21] those things amen sometimes we're just
[1:12:23] given things at trials or tests or
[1:12:26] instructions and it sometimes it's just
[1:12:27] not a time to fully understand it but
[1:12:30] it's a time to
[1:12:31] trust amen it's a time to trust his plan
[1:12:35] amen and sometimes you're going to hit
[1:12:37] walls and barriers of unbelief amen
[1:12:40] you're going to hit walls and barriers
[1:12:42] of unbelief Mark the n9th chapter said a
[1:12:44] father came to Jesus this man had
[1:12:46] brought his son before the disciples but
[1:12:48] but they couldn't cast out the spirit
[1:12:50] amen it's a familiar story but the man
[1:12:51] brings him to Jesus and he had this
[1:12:54] approach to the Lord you know cuz you
[1:12:56] know we hit that wall of Doubt sometimes
[1:12:58] we hit that wall we just can't get past
[1:13:01] Jesus said to Jesus said to him if thou
[1:13:03] can't believe all things are possible
[1:13:06] and then Mark 9:24 says straight way the
[1:13:08] father of the child cried out and said
[1:13:11] with tears Lord I believe help thou my
[1:13:15] unbelief sometimes you get to situations
[1:13:17] in your life Lord I believe help thou my
[1:13:20] unbelief you know what he's looking for
[1:13:22] he's looking for your approach to be
[1:13:24] like that man he's looking for you to
[1:13:26] surrender that thing he's looking look
[1:13:28] at the ditch that that father dug out in
[1:13:30] his life I want my son to be healed but
[1:13:33] God I need you to be the one that does
[1:13:35] it and I have this wall of doubt in my
[1:13:37] mind amen but he raised his hands and
[1:13:40] said help thou my unbelief amen you need
[1:13:43] a victory in your life and you feel like
[1:13:45] you can't get past it you have a mind
[1:13:47] battle that you're struggling with or
[1:13:49] you just say raise my hands and say help
[1:13:51] thou my unbelief I believe I can have
[1:13:54] victory over this thing I believe that I
[1:13:56] can take the commission that God has
[1:13:58] commissioned me to do that I will
[1:14:00] possess the enemy that I will pursue him
[1:14:03] amen you take that thing you dig that
[1:14:06] ditch out of your life amen expose that
[1:14:08] thing and God will deliver you saints of
[1:14:12] God God will deliver
[1:14:14] you glory to
[1:14:18] God hallelujah I wanted to pick this up
[1:14:22] trying to tie all three vers all three
[1:14:24] opening scriptures together this this
[1:14:25] evening I wanted to pick this story up
[1:14:28] here from the gospels that we open with
[1:14:30] from our opening verses Matthew
[1:14:32] 14 Jes and in straightway Jesus
[1:14:35] constrained his disciples to get into
[1:14:36] the ship to go before him onto the other
[1:14:38] side while his multitudes went away and
[1:14:40] he had sent the multitudes away he went
[1:14:42] up into a mountain apart to pray and
[1:14:44] when the evening was come he was there
[1:14:46] alone but the ship was now in the midst
[1:14:49] of the sea tossed with waves for the
[1:14:52] wind was contrary
[1:14:55] amen Jesus constrained them to get into
[1:14:59] that ship we just read that they he
[1:15:01] constrained them to get into that ship
[1:15:04] amen but now this storm had risen up the
[1:15:07] wind was blowing the word says that it
[1:15:09] was contrary means inclined to to
[1:15:12] disagree or to do the opposite of what
[1:15:15] is expected or desired amen he put them
[1:15:19] in this boat they had this Supernatural
[1:15:21] experience where he fed 5,000 then then
[1:15:23] he constrained them to get this boat and
[1:15:25] they went from this mound to this Valley
[1:15:27] and now they're you know what it was God
[1:15:30] was trying to bring them to a greater
[1:15:32] place in their faith amen God was trying
[1:15:34] to rid some of their unbelief out
[1:15:36] because if you go back and you read the
[1:15:37] story there was a hardness still in
[1:15:39] their hearts amen there was something
[1:15:41] laid in there that that he had to get
[1:15:44] that Faith to walk on water out of Peter
[1:15:47] amen sometimes he constrained you to get
[1:15:49] into a situation because he knows that
[1:15:52] there's a faith laid within you to walk
[1:15:55] on water he knows because he placed that
[1:15:58] thing there amen and he put you in that
[1:16:01] ship because he wants you to constrain
[1:16:04] him he wants you to bid him to say come
[1:16:08] out on that water
[1:16:13] amen picking that story up from from
[1:16:16] Mark's gospel Mark 6:48 says I love this
[1:16:20] and he saw them toiling in rowing for
[1:16:23] the wind was contrary unto them and
[1:16:26] about about the Fourth Watch of the
[1:16:27] night he cometh unto them saying walking
[1:16:29] upon the sea and watch Mark's testimony
[1:16:32] of it and would have passed by them and
[1:16:36] would have passed by them sometimes
[1:16:38] Saints you can get to feeling that way
[1:16:40] you get to feeling you're in a contrary
[1:16:42] wind in your life you know we can go
[1:16:44] through trials it could be mind battles
[1:16:46] it could be anything you're in a
[1:16:48] contrary wind in your life and you feel
[1:16:50] as if God is walking by you on that boat
[1:16:53] amen and his testimony marks that he
[1:16:56] walked by him I want you to catch this
[1:17:00] I'm going to come back to that in just
[1:17:02] in just a moment but we I I was reading
[1:17:04] the the sermon and I don't have time to
[1:17:06] get into all the quotes but go this
[1:17:07] homework this week go read the
[1:17:09] fundamental foundations of Faith 1955
[1:17:12] wonderful sermon brother brandham builds
[1:17:14] this remarkable case as to how our
[1:17:17] channels as unbelievers are all clogged
[1:17:21] up amen and he says now the thing of it
[1:17:23] is since he is restored man back to this
[1:17:26] place man in the fall had lost his
[1:17:29] conscience of what of what father put
[1:17:32] him here on Earth to do in other words
[1:17:35] all of the plumbing as it was in our
[1:17:37] brain the outlets the faith had been
[1:17:40] clogged up with business affairs with
[1:17:42] home life with domestic things it had
[1:17:45] become so clogged up with that until God
[1:17:49] can't operate through those channels
[1:17:52] that he made a man for catch that he he
[1:17:56] they got clogged up you get clogged up
[1:17:58] with all these things in your life but
[1:18:01] God made those channels so that he could
[1:18:03] operate his faith that he placed in you
[1:18:06] amen and you go back and you read that
[1:18:09] story they channels all those disciples
[1:18:12] on that boat their channels were all
[1:18:14] clogged up you know like I said they
[1:18:16] were they had just it was just the
[1:18:17] miracle of feeding 5,000 they were on
[1:18:20] this boat they were scared from the
[1:18:22] storm they were scared when they saw Jes
[1:18:24] Jesus thinking he was some kind of a
[1:18:26] spirit their channels were all clogged
[1:18:28] up they had a hardness in their heart
[1:18:31] and after the entire experience he
[1:18:33] jumped into the boat with him and they
[1:18:35] declared thou truly are the Son of God
[1:18:38] you see they were they were still living
[1:18:39] with some unbelief in their heart and I
[1:18:41] want you to notice something God knew
[1:18:44] that there was going to be a storm in
[1:18:46] their life he was the one who put that
[1:18:49] put them in that
[1:18:51] boat you know if you go and read if you
[1:18:54] go and look at the Sea of tiberias which
[1:18:56] was the sea they were on the Sea of
[1:18:58] Galilee come come to find out it's a 64
[1:19:01] square mile
[1:19:03] 41,000 Acres large lake that they was on
[1:19:06] he could have walked anywhere on that
[1:19:09] water amen and though sometimes we we
[1:19:12] read where it felt like Mark said it
[1:19:14] felt like he was going to walk on by
[1:19:16] sometimes it feels like he's walking on
[1:19:17] by he purposed in his heart to walk by
[1:19:21] you just when you need it
[1:19:25] he purposed in his heart to walk by you
[1:19:29] he purposed in his heart to be walking
[1:19:31] along one day 8 miles away from where he
[1:19:35] had been resurrected on in that tomb 8
[1:19:38] miles away at the road of emus 8 miles
[1:19:41] from that he purposed in his heart
[1:19:43] because he wanted to break the re the
[1:19:45] bread of Revelation to those men and it
[1:19:48] wasn't until they opened up their heart
[1:19:51] amen they wasn't until they constrained
[1:19:54] Jesus it wasn't until they compelled him
[1:19:57] and said Jesus I need you to come into
[1:19:59] my house some of us tonight just need to
[1:20:02] compel Jesus and constrain Jesus just
[1:20:06] come into my heart just break the bread
[1:20:08] of Revelation to me once more Lord I
[1:20:11] need more of you in my life if I don't
[1:20:13] have the Holy Ghost I need it if I don't
[1:20:15] have Victory I need it if I don't have
[1:20:18] something I need it Lord and I need you
[1:20:20] to give it to me but now I'm not going
[1:20:22] to keep on walking I'm not going to let
[1:20:24] my testimony be that that just kept on
[1:20:27] walking where I heard nice things
[1:20:29] because if you go read that story they
[1:20:31] heard some pretty nice things that day
[1:20:33] God had opened up the scriptures from
[1:20:35] Moses all the way down they had the
[1:20:38] award feast and I believe across this
[1:20:41] Pulpit we've had a word Feast but what
[1:20:43] will you do with it what are we doing
[1:20:46] with it are we pursuing God are we
[1:20:49] pursuing him more in our life are you
[1:20:51] digging those ditches out and allowing
[1:20:54] the Lord L to come in and break that
[1:20:56] bread to you
[1:21:00] Hallelujah glory to God there was a
[1:21:03] faith laid within them because God put
[1:21:06] it there there's a faith in you and I
[1:21:09] know it because God put it there you
[1:21:12] know it because God put it there you've
[1:21:14] got the desire amen now what will you do
[1:21:17] with that
[1:21:20] desire glory to God one day soon all the
[1:21:24] those experiences and all those trials
[1:21:27] all those mind battles all those things
[1:21:29] those storms those contrary winds you'll
[1:21:33] recognize that it was all for a purpose
[1:21:36] to bring that Faith to to bring that
[1:21:40] Faith to life to energize that thing
[1:21:43] Amen to unclog the channels that we get
[1:21:47] so clogged up with it doesn't have to be
[1:21:49] just trial it can be anything it can be
[1:21:51] business Affairs you get so clogged up
[1:21:54] with what got to do and this and
[1:21:56] tomorrow and I'm sure half of us that
[1:21:58] were in here when we first got in here
[1:22:00] we're thinking about what we're going to
[1:22:01] do tomorrow we're thinking about what
[1:22:02] we'll do next week what about right now
[1:22:05] what are you doing with God's word that
[1:22:07] he's breaking to you right now what are
[1:22:09] you doing with the word of the hour that
[1:22:11] he's come and he's so Faithfully put and
[1:22:14] opened and unveiled what are you doing
[1:22:16] with it right
[1:22:20] now
[1:22:22] Hallelujah he could have walked in
[1:22:24] anywhere but he didn't he walked along
[1:22:26] their
[1:22:30] path what was it Saints Peter had
[1:22:33] remembered back to the last time that
[1:22:36] they were in a boat on this very same
[1:22:39] Lake a little while earlier Peter had
[1:22:41] been fishing amen remember all night
[1:22:45] with not one fish caught he was tired he
[1:22:48] was hungry he was Peter so he's probably
[1:22:52] frustrated amen we can get that way
[1:22:54] frustrated maybe he kept casting his net
[1:22:58] he kept doing all these things that that
[1:23:00] he that he knew how to do in his own
[1:23:03] understanding but Jesus came and
[1:23:05] said cast on the other side cast your
[1:23:09] net Simon said Master we have we've
[1:23:12] toiled all night and we've taken
[1:23:14] nothing you know we get to those places
[1:23:17] Lord I've done this over and over I've
[1:23:20] raised my hands over and over I I've
[1:23:22] tried to have the victory over and over
[1:23:25] but nevertheless at Thy word Lord I'll
[1:23:29] cast my net on the other side I've done
[1:23:32] it a hundred times but I'll do it again
[1:23:35] because this time it's going to be
[1:23:37] different this time it'll be at your
[1:23:39] word Lord this time I know that whatever
[1:23:43] you say is going to change the situation
[1:23:46] in your
[1:23:47] life Hallelujah and when they had done
[1:23:50] this thing they enclosed a great
[1:23:52] multitude of fishes and their their net
[1:23:54] break amen I bet their faith was just so
[1:23:58] Skyrocket high at that point oh we've
[1:24:00] toiled all night oh you've had this
[1:24:02] trial you've had this mind battle but
[1:24:05] now is the time for victory in your life
[1:24:08] amen cast the net on the other side of
[1:24:11] the boat one more time at God's word and
[1:24:15] nevertheless he will be faithful to give
[1:24:17] you what you have need of Glory to God
[1:24:21] Hall
[1:24:24] yes Lord this time it was different it
[1:24:27] was on the foundation of God's word it
[1:24:30] wasn't on the foundation of my
[1:24:33] understanding it wasn't on the
[1:24:35] foundation of what I think or or how
[1:24:38] hard I'm going to try I'm going to try
[1:24:40] and try it wasn't on that Foundation
[1:24:43] anymore he had a revelation amen and
[1:24:45] when that Revelation strikes your heart
[1:24:48] my brother my sister young people when
[1:24:50] that Revelation strikes your heart you
[1:24:52] know that you know that you know that
[1:24:55] you are hidden away in Christ glory to
[1:24:59] God
[1:25:03] hallelujah you see Peter had experienced
[1:25:07] something with Jesus that defied
[1:25:10] anything that made sense at all and in
[1:25:13] this moment of
[1:25:14] fear when Jesus was walking on the water
[1:25:17] he remember
[1:25:20] back he remembered back to those words
[1:25:23] when he caught that fish he just needed
[1:25:26] that word he just needed that word so
[1:25:30] when Peter was in the boat the second
[1:25:33] time all he needed was the same word
[1:25:37] Lord I need your word bid me to come out
[1:25:43] on that
[1:25:44] waterall oh and it wasn't trying to jump
[1:25:47] through some hoops it wasn't some
[1:25:49] complicated thing it's not
[1:25:52] complicated bid me to come and then I'll
[1:25:54] take that step of faith and I'll walk
[1:25:57] where you tell me to walk Lord Jesus
[1:25:59] I'll go where you tell me to go because
[1:26:02] God Almighty told me that I need to be
[1:26:05] in this place I asked and it was given
[1:26:07] to me I knocked and I Found Glory to God
[1:26:11] and he took that step of faith on the
[1:26:14] basis of God's
[1:26:17] word he just needed that word amen I
[1:26:21] believe we've got that word sometimes
[1:26:23] you just need that word if you don't
[1:26:25] have it pursue it if you don't have it
[1:26:28] knock and knock if you don't have it
[1:26:31] seek and you'll find if you don't have
[1:26:34] it continue to go until you have it
[1:26:38] glory to God bid me to
[1:26:41] come Saints I believe sometimes you know
[1:26:45] you might have been doing something over
[1:26:47] and over and it might you might feel
[1:26:50] exhausted like those brothers did you
[1:26:51] might feel exhausted like Peter did amen
[1:26:55] but there is Deliverance in God's
[1:26:59] word nevertheless we believe in the
[1:27:01] Supernatural things just to build a
[1:27:03] simple foundation on faith you know you
[1:27:05] love somebody you can't you can't try to
[1:27:08] explain it you can't try to try to feel
[1:27:10] it but you you know you love somebody
[1:27:13] you know when you feel Joy you know
[1:27:15] because there's just something inside of
[1:27:17] you that's happy you're just you're just
[1:27:19] glorious I know when I've got my joy
[1:27:21] I've got my joy Hallelujah you know when
[1:27:24] you when you have that in you you know
[1:27:26] when there's patience that you peace
[1:27:28] that passes understanding th those
[1:27:30] things are the supernatural things
[1:27:32] Hallelujah you know when you have that
[1:27:34] amen and it makes the difference because
[1:27:37] you can do whatever God has set for you
[1:27:40] to do amen you just need you just need
[1:27:43] to call out bid me to come Lord walk on
[1:27:46] that
[1:27:47] water you know we always we always look
[1:27:51] at that and said man Peter you lost your
[1:27:54] Faith what kind of Faith did it take to
[1:27:57] walk on that water and defy gravity and
[1:28:01] space and matter all in an instant it
[1:28:03] was a faith that God placed in Peter
[1:28:07] that he was going to know because he
[1:28:08] didn't have the Holy Ghost yet but he
[1:28:10] was building Peter to be a foundation of
[1:28:13] Faith so that he could write these books
[1:28:15] so that he could proclaim the word and
[1:28:17] he's building you in the same manner now
[1:28:21] Hallelujah he's building your faith Day
[1:28:23] by by day little by little trial by
[1:28:26] trial mind battle by mind Battle Victory
[1:28:29] by Victory amen glory to
[1:28:34] God oh Peter Lord I've done it I've done
[1:28:37] it Lord he I want you just notice you
[1:28:41] know he wanted go he wanted Jesus to
[1:28:44] know Lord I've done it I've already I've
[1:28:47] I've already done that you know I've
[1:28:48] I've kind of already done that you know
[1:28:51] I've already done that Lord but
[1:28:52] nevertheless
[1:28:54] amen oh Lord help thou my unbelief
[1:28:59] nevertheless at Thy word
[1:29:01] Lord even though you've prayed about a
[1:29:05] situation maybe maybe you felt like
[1:29:07] Peter just casted on the other side cast
[1:29:11] once more
[1:29:13] amen this is but a light thing for the
[1:29:16] Lord that's not Caleb's word that's the
[1:29:18] word from almighty God this is but a
[1:29:21] light thing for God
[1:29:26] Hallelujah you know what was it that
[1:29:28] made him start sinking was it that the
[1:29:31] circumstance changed did did the storm
[1:29:35] stop raging no did God change his mind
[1:29:39] no so what could it have
[1:29:41] been his channels got clogged up and
[1:29:46] fear crept into that place where Faith
[1:29:49] had just resided fear crept into that
[1:29:52] place amen but the word of God said I
[1:29:55] have not given you the spirit of fear
[1:29:58] but of love and of power and of a sound
[1:30:01] mind and I believe that a sound mind can
[1:30:04] be free of depression and can be free of
[1:30:06] anxiety and can be free of the fear of
[1:30:09] this world because it's in God's word so
[1:30:12] I just hold on to whatever God's word
[1:30:15] says and I take a one foot and I put it
[1:30:18] in front of the other and I'm going to B
[1:30:20] Lord bid me to come I want to walk on
[1:30:23] that water Lord I'm going to cast my net
[1:30:26] again I'm going to take that step of
[1:30:28] Faith glory to
[1:30:31] God well when Caleb and Joshua came back
[1:30:35] from Kadesh barnea you know they were
[1:30:37] looking at the same thing that those
[1:30:38] other spies were but what was it catch
[1:30:41] this the Bible says that they had a
[1:30:44] different spirit with them they were
[1:30:47] looking at it through a different lens
[1:30:50] amen Peter started out right his eyes
[1:30:54] focused on Jesus but the devil started
[1:30:57] bombarding him and overwhelming him with
[1:31:01] contrary winds fear and doubt amen and
[1:31:04] he started to sink and I believe that
[1:31:07] the enemy is going to come and try to do
[1:31:09] that and the Very that very thing in
[1:31:12] each of Our Lives
[1:31:15] amen I just I love that story on that
[1:31:17] road there God doesn't do anything by
[1:31:20] accident friends you weren't born into a
[1:31:22] family that went to a m Mage Church by
[1:31:24] an accident you you didn't stumble upon
[1:31:27] a man who gave you a tape by an accident
[1:31:30] nothing happens by accident amen 8 miles
[1:31:33] away from the tomb the Bible says three
[1:31:35] score furlongs eight miles that wasn't
[1:31:37] any accident God is Purpose Driven
[1:31:40] 41,000 squ Acres Jesus could have walked
[1:31:43] anywhere God is purposeful in what he
[1:31:47] does and as they were walking and
[1:31:49] talking oh he just they just they be he
[1:31:52] began to ask him just this man appeared
[1:31:54] out an nowhere be just begin to ask him
[1:31:57] what what are you all upset about saying
[1:31:59] sometimes Jesus just wants us wants to
[1:32:01] hear us
[1:32:03] testify amen and I just love that
[1:32:05] because they just started to go the
[1:32:07] great prophet was Among Us and he did
[1:32:10] many great things you know we believed
[1:32:12] him to be the one that was to redeem
[1:32:15] Israel but then our high priest and our
[1:32:18] and our leaders they delivered him into
[1:32:19] into the Romans to be crucified and he
[1:32:22] was killed but now this is the third day
[1:32:26] and some of our friends went to his tomb
[1:32:28] and but when they got there he wasn't
[1:32:30] there this these weren't just any old
[1:32:32] people these were people that we know
[1:32:34] and that we trust they got there and
[1:32:36] said that Jesus wasn't there they said
[1:32:38] that they had a testimony that they had
[1:32:40] a vision that that the Angels appeared
[1:32:43] and said he's not in this tomb anymore
[1:32:45] amen but he's risen from the dead so
[1:32:48] then more of our friends went to the
[1:32:50] very same place and the very same
[1:32:52] testimony came out Jesus was nowhere to
[1:32:54] be found oh my and then Jesus just
[1:32:57] begins revealing the word to him and
[1:32:59] expounding it says the the Bible says
[1:33:01] they Jesus expounded to them all that
[1:33:05] the prophets have spoken concerning
[1:33:07] himself they were fellowshipping with
[1:33:09] the very man that they were testifying
[1:33:12] of it and they didn't know amen and
[1:33:15] catch this as they drew nigh Under The
[1:33:18] Village after the after their
[1:33:19] conversation on the road to the onto
[1:33:22] emus it was as if he made as though he
[1:33:26] would have gone
[1:33:28] further that struck me he made as though
[1:33:31] he would have gone further Mark's
[1:33:33] testimony said when we where we read
[1:33:36] earlier said Jesus was walking on the
[1:33:38] water but it was as if he was going to
[1:33:40] keep on walking and now cleopas is very
[1:33:44] testimony was it it was as if Jesus was
[1:33:47] going to keep on walking but verse 29
[1:33:50] says they constrained him saying abide
[1:33:54] with us for it is toward evening and the
[1:33:57] day is far spent and what did he do he
[1:34:00] went in to Terry with them they
[1:34:03] compelled Jesus it it was because they
[1:34:06] had a determined Faith amen they it was
[1:34:09] more than just a desire in their hearts
[1:34:12] they pursued that desire they compelled
[1:34:15] him if you've ever been compelled you
[1:34:17] you you you no you can't leave my house
[1:34:21] I you can't come inside Abode with me me
[1:34:24] and and he gave them and it wasn't until
[1:34:27] that happened that it came to pass that
[1:34:30] he sat at meat with him that he took the
[1:34:32] bread blessed it break it and gave it to
[1:34:34] him and their eyes were open the
[1:34:38] Revelation came open to the word of God
[1:34:42] they became a part of his
[1:34:45] resurrection you are a part of his
[1:34:48] resurrection when you constrain the Lord
[1:34:51] Jesus amen Revelation
[1:34:56] struck saints of God I believe we're
[1:34:58] coming to a close I believe that this
[1:35:01] little humble Wednesday night I believe
[1:35:03] that God is here amen he's where two or
[1:35:06] three are gathered amen and I believe
[1:35:08] there's more of himself that he wants to
[1:35:11] give to us all those all all those men
[1:35:15] walking on the water saw Jesus walking
[1:35:17] on the water but Peter cried out to him
[1:35:20] pass me not I'm in the middle of my
[1:35:23] storm dear Lord and I need you because
[1:35:25] he had experienced that what if Copus
[1:35:28] had never constrained Jesus what if he
[1:35:31] let that conviction stay shut up in your
[1:35:33] hearts don't let the conviction stay
[1:35:36] shut up in your heart saints of God
[1:35:40] let's just stand to our feet this
[1:35:41] evening as the musicians would come and
[1:35:44] play that song uh pass me not if you
[1:35:47] could if you know that oh gentle
[1:35:51] savior Saints God like I said a simple
[1:35:54] thought tonight for a Wednesday night
[1:35:57] there's a difference between having a
[1:36:02] desire and
[1:36:04] pursuing that
[1:36:07] desire when was the last time that you
[1:36:11] constrained Jesus to break bread with
[1:36:14] you in your house not just hearing
[1:36:18] church not just merely talking about it
[1:36:21] oh that was a great service but really
[1:36:24] constraining him Lord I've heard your
[1:36:27] word and something stirred in my heart
[1:36:31] that's what God does at the ministering
[1:36:33] of his word something stirs in our heart
[1:36:35] now what will you do with it what will
[1:36:39] you do with the stirring of that desire
[1:36:42] in your heart
[1:36:45] constrain it wasn't until Copus
[1:36:48] constrained Jesus to come into his house
[1:36:51] that he broke the bread in just a
[1:36:53] specific manner that his eyes came open
[1:36:56] to the revelation of it that it was
[1:36:59] Jesus the
[1:37:00] Christ Hallelujah Jesus had talked with
[1:37:04] them about the
[1:37:06] scriptures you know there's something
[1:37:08] about knowing the
[1:37:10] word but knowing who wrote the word is
[1:37:15] different having that connection with
[1:37:18] with the
[1:37:19] author what will you do with what you've
[1:37:23] heard
[1:37:24] he's willing to open it up to you you
[1:37:26] know
[1:37:27] Jesus was a busy man that day he had
[1:37:31] many things that he had need to do he
[1:37:33] had many tasks at
[1:37:35] hand but two men were walking along the
[1:37:40] way thinking about Jesus talking about
[1:37:42] Jesus and they constrained him and you
[1:37:45] know what he did he didn't say no not
[1:37:47] now when I give my spirit and maybe no
[1:37:51] he went in to Su with them he went to
[1:37:53] break that bread with him just let's all
[1:37:56] just close our eyes
[1:37:58] tonight he's willing to break the bread
[1:38:02] of life to you and I believe that he
[1:38:06] wants you to walk on the water of
[1:38:08] Revelation like Peter did amen I believe
[1:38:11] he wants to break that bread of life to
[1:38:14] you but you know what Peter had to do
[1:38:17] Peter had to take the first
[1:38:21] step he had to take take the first
[1:38:25] step
[1:38:28] Hallelujah he's not too busy for you
[1:38:31] friends their testimony were as if he
[1:38:34] were to walk
[1:38:35] by Jesus is walking Among Us I believe
[1:38:39] with all my
[1:38:40] heart and he's he's willing to come in
[1:38:43] and suck with you but he just needs an
[1:38:48] invitation how many are willing to raise
[1:38:50] up your hand and invite him in to to
[1:38:53] break that bread of Revelation to you to
[1:38:58] break break you free from this thing to
[1:39:01] have you step out onto the water to have
[1:39:04] you cast your net on the other side he's
[1:39:08] willing Hallelujah constrain the Lord
[1:39:12] just for a moment constrain him those
[1:39:16] lyrics say pass me not oh gentle savior
[1:39:20] and hear my humble cry and while on
[1:39:23] others Thou Art calling do not pass me
[1:39:27] by oh let me at thy Throne of Mercy find
[1:39:32] a sweet relief kneeling there in deep
[1:39:36] Contrition in in deep sincerity in deep
[1:39:42] repentance help my
[1:39:44] unbelief help thou my unbelief trusting
[1:39:48] only in thy Merit would I seek thy face
[1:39:52] heal my wounded broken Spirit oh it's
[1:39:55] all encapsulated here oh healing for the
[1:39:59] wounded victory for the Mind battle all
[1:40:02] of it is laying in the
[1:40:04] word thou the spring of all my comfort
[1:40:08] moral life to me whom have I on Earth

[1:47:15] amen
[1:47:18] amen hello testing no not working
[1:47:27] [Music]
[1:47:31] I actually have two but I'll be real
[1:47:33] quick when um Luther and I
[1:47:36] were vacation K we were we had went to
[1:47:41] one part of Kentucky for a few days and
[1:47:43] then we were going to travel over to
[1:47:44] another part of Kentucky and Hike there
[1:47:47] well the day that we traveled over we
[1:47:48] really didn't plan on hiking but we
[1:47:50] ended up taking a walk that ended up
[1:47:52] into a hike and during that time when I
[1:47:56] hike I always keep a skirt that has
[1:47:58] pockets and um since I didn't think I
[1:48:01] was going to be hiking I didn't have
[1:48:02] pockets and so I had my phone and my
[1:48:05] little purse and you know I wasn't
[1:48:08] expecting to be hiking so I wasn't
[1:48:09] prepared and I lost my phone and I just
[1:48:13] you know thinking about it the details
[1:48:15] of it to me God was there so many you
[1:48:18] know that just all along the way because
[1:48:20] for one I wouldn't have noticed it until
[1:48:22] I gotten back to you know where we were
[1:48:25] staying and then I wouldn't have known
[1:48:26] where I lost it but he had me notice it
[1:48:29] while we were still there you know in
[1:48:30] the park and was able to retrace our
[1:48:32] steps and we thought for sure so the
[1:48:35] walk that turned into a hike we'd gotten
[1:48:38] on one Trail and we crossed over to
[1:48:39] another Trail so we were off the trails
[1:48:42] at that time and so we had to go over a
[1:48:44] tree and so you know when I realized I
[1:48:48] didn't have my my phone and I was
[1:48:50] panicked because everything's on my
[1:48:52] phone
[1:48:53] and you know these days everything's
[1:48:54] face ID so I don't know a password and I
[1:48:58] wouldn't even know where to start and um
[1:49:01] so it just panicked me the thought of
[1:49:03] that Luther's like oh it's okay it's
[1:49:05] probably where we crossed that tree
[1:49:06] we'll just go back and get it well it
[1:49:08] wasn't where we passed the tree it was
[1:49:10] just in a ramom spot on the trail but
[1:49:12] God allowed me to notice it and I was
[1:49:14] able to find it so I want to thank God
[1:49:16] for that and then even closer to my
[1:49:19] heart than my phone um today was the day
[1:49:22] day of testing the last testing for my
[1:49:25] first grade class and it's a big deal
[1:49:27] for them and for me and praise God they
[1:49:31] all um did very were very successful in
[1:49:34] their testing I just want to thank God
[1:49:36] because that is all his doings I know
[1:49:38] that without him I couldn't do this job
