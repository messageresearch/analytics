[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] continue father amen God bless you can be seated if you want to bring up that PowerPoint for me please I think I had it ready on the page that I wanted it and it's up there the back back monitor is not on all right so I'm just going to get right into it this is sometimes people you'll see people say you know this is speaking about heaven isn't practical uh because it's getting our minds off of what's what is going on today or you know it's not present tense but I think that that's a that's an error that's a mistake to think of teaching on and meditating on Heaven uh and and we'll see that why in in CS Lewis Mere Christianity he says a continually looking forward to the Eternal world is not as some Modern people think a form of escapism or wishful thinking but one of the things a Christian is meant to do it does not mean that we are to leave the present worlds as it is if you read history you'll find that the Christians who did most for the present world were just those who thought most of the next the apostles themselves who set foot the conversion of the Roman Empire the Great Men Who Built up the Middle Ages the English evangelicals who abolished the slave trade all left their mark on Earth precisely because their minds were occupied with Heaven it is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so ineffective in this aim at heaven and you'll get Earth thrown in AIM at Earth and you'll get neither and that's what the scripture tells us set your affection your desires your passion your vision for Life set your affection on things that are above not on things that are on the earth and and I believe this is a critical thing and and critical to us to be balanced Christians is to understand that this is not our home that we're not citizens of America merely but that our citizenship is in heaven from whence we look for a savior you know we're supposed to look forward with joy with hope for our future this world I mean there's not a lot of Hope in it and it's getting worse and worse and worse is it so cold in here that my hands feel numb I must be becoming a southerner so I know brother Mark's working on on getting things fixed so we'll just pray for him amen so you know our our mind needs to have that Focus if we lose that focus and that hope for our future State and our future home we lose many things along with that and are that's why people become so entrenched in this world and the World system and politics and they get pulled aside into things that don't mean very much really and you know it's it's so easy to get caught up in it because there's so much evil and and we know the truth and we know what's good and what's right but the reality is you never affect if you want to affect change in the world you don't do it by responding directly to the devil you do it by doing what God has called you to do so if you want to change the world we don't engage directly in politics to change the world we preach the gospel and we love as an individual we love people we love it's you and your home and your family and the Small Things loving loving your neighbor loving the person that's unlovable reaching out to people that's the that's the thing that changes a neighborhood a a a City a state a country the world is when you yourself do the very small things that God is asking you to do to love your neighbor as yourself and without a vision from God of our future we will be very ineffective at doing that because the whole world is against us the whole world hates us and you have to understand that it might cost you doing the small thing of love it might cost you your life maybe not in Buford South Carolina but in places in the world it may do that so without a vision of what God has for us that this is just temporary this is this this isn't our Eternal home this this is a temporary condition soon we'll be in a body that's impervious to pain and can't be broken can't be hurt this is a temporary amen all right let's look at uh revelation oh before we do that I want to look at this I hope you could see that okay just looking at the future home timeline so you have in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth right Paradise begins on Earth and if if we look at that and we remember even even in this place God gave them a test and gave them a testing and it was always God's purpose even in the original Paradise for there to be a test well the test came and they failed the test they sinned and this put the whole creation into corruption into the bondage of corruption and under the effects of sin so when that happens Paradise is lost now there comes a separation if you need to stand up and do jumping jacks feel free I won't be offended Paradise is lost this is when what what I would just I'm terming as intermediate Heaven begins it's not not any necessarily doctrinal term but I would just look at it as an intermediate heaven so what happens is Heaven and Earth were once one Earth was Paradise when the fall happened this was separated we we don't have act we don't see in that Dimension anymore that's over with that's ended so that's there's a separation and we'll get we'll get into that this Earth is merely a shadow of that world right so if we know what this Earth is like as a shadow then we know what that place is like over there so that is separated now now now there's a Plan of Redemption immediately he says there's going to be a seed of the woman that crushes the head of the serpent amen and so God sets forth to bring forth his Plan of Redemption to not only redeem his creation on the Earth but to redeem his Earth as well this intermediate Heaven actually was in the heart of the earth before the resurrection of Christ when a righteous person died they went to the Grave or sheld or whatever you want to call it which was two compartments one was torment and one was Abraham's bosom or Paradise is another way Jesus says today you'll be with me in Paradise that was in the heart of the Earth when the resurrection happened Christ brought the righteous Saints out of that paradise that was in the heart of the earth emptied out and was brought into Heavenly places a little closer to the presence of God there because of the blood of Jesus Christ before that they had to go to the heart of the earth why their sins were merely covered the blood of bull it's impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins so they merely covered and pushed it forward until the perfect sacrifice could come that his sacrifice could be made the blood could be shed and then his life could come back upon the worshipper the life of a blood and Bulls and bulls and goats they couldn't come back on the worshipper because it wasn't the same life but now it's the very life of God in the man Christ Jesus that Holy Spirit comes back upon us and accomplishes perfect Redemption for the the inner man amen coming soon coming soon to to the Earth near you the Millennium that's the reign of Christ and the Saints on Earth over the Nations thousand years later what happens Satan is let out gathers together the Nations to fight against them fire comes from Heaven the white Throne comes then what do we have the intermediate Heaven actually comes to an end why does it come to an end it doesn't come to an end it comes back to its beginning Heaven and Earth are joined back together not in the Millennium but on the new Heaven and the new Earth when the New Jerusalem comes down from God out of Heaven to make that that Abode there on Earth then there's no more intermediate Heaven All Is One God will be all in all that doesn't mean mean like the Hindus believe that everything is God no what it is is that everything now be is into that place where it is an expression of God all of God's attributes are on display in full maturity in the new Heaven and the new Earth amen all right so Revelation 7:9 let look a little bit more I think many times as I as I started this we look at what we see depicted in you know cartoons and movies and it's sort of this this white dry sterile Place boring that's not what heaven is like at all and we have to get that picture out of our minds that is not at all what heaven is like this this Earth is a reflection of that if that's the case then what is heaven where do we go and is it just a just a flat plain place no it's a place bursting with life after this I behold in low a great multitude which no man could number of all Nations and kindreds of people and tongues stood Before the Throne and before the lamb clothed with right white robes and Palms in their hands where where do Palms come from Palm Trees so evidently there's trees in heaven which is exactly what brother brandham tells us you see a tree dying here means that there's another Tree on the other side that isn't dying it's hard for us to comprehend but remember everything here is a shadow of what's over there 2 Kings 211 came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and part of them both of sunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven well you could say this is merely just a supernatural thing well well a chariot of fire and Horses of fire came out of heaven and we have a precedent for that as well in Revelation 17 so there's chariots and there's horses in heaven Revelation 1911 I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God God and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean so there they are there's horses in heaven there's animals in heaven we can we can take from this this is not just horses in heaven there's other animals in heaven if you as we get further we won't get to it this time but as we get further you'll see brother brandham in the intermediate Heaven his dog runs up to him his horse runs up to him Hebrews 8:5 who serve unto the example and Shadow of heavy Heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he is about to make the Tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern showed thee in the mount so he went up to the mountain and there was a pattern shown him so he was Heaven was opened up to Moses and he saw what heaven was like and God said make the Tabernacle just like the one you saw in heaven Hebrews 9:11 but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building and then verse 24 for Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us all right so as we as we look at this and we see this we see there's a that heaven is the substance if you think about that he what what is in heaven is more real than what is here on Earth not to us we can't fathom that I can't I can explain that to you logically for you to understand that because this is all that we know but we're just the creatures of this dimension I it's very difficult to even try to attempt to explain it brother brandom says it's traveling F it's moving faster well what does that mean it's moving faster right well we're going to catch up to it well okay explain that to me in in detail right that we we can't because it's right here it's not low as we're chasing it through right but it's right here it's just it's uh what do you say it's megahertz are faster than here I don't know there's something beyond that that when we get there we'll be able to understand it but here we just believe it's by faith we see and we understand these things from the word and we just say amen that's what the word says Hebrews 12:22 but you are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and into two and a numerable company of angels okay when am I come under that when now now it's not as though this is just speaking of something future right there is a Heavenly Jerusalem now there is a Heavenly T Tabernacle now there is a city of the Living God it's right near us it's right around us you are already in this moment when you walk by faith you are come to an innumerable company of angels you're come to Mount Zion where is it it's just a little bit faster you can't see it now but one day you will in things that are to be brother Bram speaks about that he says now we know that Moses in building the Tabernacle in the wilderness or preparing it he said he made all things after the order of what he saw in heaven see so the Earthly things only express what the Eternal things are and if this Earth that we live in today being so great as we love it and love to live and breathe the air and see the flowers and things if that if this here is the expression one that's dying is only expressing one that's Eternal when you see a tree struggling pulling trying to live that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do that when you see a man here struggling to live somebody in a hospital um struggling and the death rattles is in their throat and pulling and crying and screaming for Life what does that mean there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that see it just doesn't do it and as we read before Jesus said unto him verily the thief on the cross verily I say unto thee today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise we look at this word Paradise this is the theer definition among the Persians a grand and closure or preserve Hunting Ground Park shady and well watered which wild animals were kept for the hunt it was enclosed by walls and furnished with towers for the hunters a garden a pleasure ground again Jesus uses this term when he speaks to the thief on the cross you'll be with me even in the he the the paradise that was in the heart of the earth it wasn't just some clean room it was a you you explain it to me I can't explain it but he refers to it as a paradise it's a pleasure ground it's a place you know a garden is a place that someone designs right they take time to design it put it in order make it look beautiful make it look enjoyable and this is what heaven is liken unto a paradise so this idea that that it's some boring place is just totally unscriptural I believe it's an invention of Satan to make it seem like it's a boring place it's not a boring place it's a beautiful place it's you know you think you you know you go to the beach or you go to some tropical place or into the mountains and you're a struck by it right it's amazing and you wish that that experience would never end well it does it always does but in in heaven even right now not just the not not just the Eternal age of the new Heaven and the new Earth but even right now Heaven is so much more beautiful and Grand than than what we can even imagine par you know Paradise let's look at this a little bit more Paradise doesn't refer to a wild place right it refers to a place man was put in the garden right to keep it to dress it and to keep it so there God created it God set it up God constituted it God founded it but he put man there to take care of it see and so I think that's the same picture that we have of Heaven it's an orderly place that that is set up that man is there to tend it see you think we're going to a place and we're just going to rest and and and do nothing no that's not what brother brandham taught us we're going to live we're going to work we're going to real life all right Alistair McGrath says the idea of a Walled Garden enclosing a carefully cultivated area of Exquisite plants and animals was the most powerful symbol of paradise available to the human imagination mingling the images of the beauty of nature with the orderliness of human construction the whole of human history is thus enfolded in the subtle interplay of Sorrow over Lost Paradise and the hope of its final restoration this this reflects even what brother brandham says in the sermon super sign said neb Nebuchadnezzar built a super City it had Hanging Gardens and it was a great place it was a pattern of Heaven think of that a pagan King builds a beautiful walled City with Incredible Gardens they say it was one of the Wonders of the Ancient Ancient Earth and brother Bram himself says see it was a pattern of heaven right before the throne flowed the river Euphrates and they find out that that's the the way the Throne of God the River of Life by The Throne of God is so again I encourage you if you don't catch anything out of this today catch this and that's that heaven that you're going to is an incredible beautiful place filled with excitement joy in a place where we can really be who God made us to be without any hindrance from the devil nevertheless we also understand that the intermediate heaven isn't our permanent home our permanent home is here on Earth when Heaven and Earth become one again back to God's original creation only Satan has been defeated and destroyed and he'll be annihilated for for all of eternity never to bother us again in the intermediate Heaven though we long for the fulfill fulfillment of God's word amen look at the the Jewish Saints who were martyred their their they praying and asking God while they're in heaven how long do we have to wait until you fulfill your word in bringing Vengeance on those who destroyed us even the bride who's there is waiting and rejoicing when bab mystery Babylon is destroyed see and they're rejoicing they're desire is not just to remain in the intermediate heaven but their desire is for the word of God to be completely fulfilled right your desire to see the word of God completely fulfilled it won't change when you go to the intermediate heaven when you go there you certainly will have that desire more and it will be even greater and that's the source of of our prayers when we're there I mean you say you're going to we will because the Saints in the Bible that were in heaven were praying for God to bring his word to pass amen and we know that there's also a cloud of witnesses that right now is watching us and cheering us on and no doubt praying now the dividing line is that's where the Catholics mix it up they say oh there's a cloud of witnesses therefore we should ask them to pray for us no that's spiritualism we don't we don't do that we pray we're taught by the Lord Jesus to pray to the father in the name of Jesus Christ Revelation 2:7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God I find this so amazing this verse because it's spoken as though it's present tense and it is present tense and under understand if you understand the true teaching about what happened in the Garden of Eden you'll understand that the two trees that stood in the midst of the garden were not literal trees they were figurative trees there's no trees that you can eat their fruit and it's going to produce give you eternal life or there's no fruit that you can eat that's going to cause you to realize that you're naked right and make you feel the sense of guilt no that that was a figurative tree that's a whole other teaching and and subject in itself but as we understand that it was a figurative tree then we can understand that when he when we eat if we if we're Overcomers the promise is you can eat of the Tree of Life which still is in the midst of the paradise of God so how is it still in the midst of the paradise of God well think about when the the fall came did God put a fence around um the Garden of Eden so that we couldn't get in and they he put a big old angel with a flaming sword and we if we find that place maybe it's in Antarctica that's why everybody's so scared of going to Antarctica is that there's a big Angel there guarding from going into the tree of life I don't believe that's right the the Garden of Eden was likely in the Middle East and no doubt connection to the promised land if the land is so important and God wants to bring restoration there no doubt there's some connection to the land but even that is another subject in itself but but there he he didn't place a fence around it with a big angel that we can all see and get afraid of to run away from what is it he took he separated Heaven and Earth he separated Paradise from Earth we don't have access to that Dimension anymore it's separated but if you're an overcomer you're going to eat of that that tree of life which is still it's still in the midst of the paradise of God so if it's a literal tree we should be able to find it and if we're Overcomers we'll get access to that tree no it's not a literal tree it's a it's obviously a figurative tree it's based on the promises that we're going to we will if we overcome we will be in the midst of the paradise of God feasting on his very life a part of his very life and that's critical to understand that se separation but the separation doesn't mean that that that that's going to stay cuz we understand the separ that be it becomes restored Paradise will be on Earth again everything that we've lost will be restored to us amen every tear that we have is stored in a bottle by the Lord Jesus and he is going to bring joy to those places where we've been hurt where we've been broken and all you know everything that quote unquote we've lost we haven't lost anything if you're a real believer you haven't lost one bit of it look at the visions that the lord gave brother brandham did he lose his wife hope no didn't lose her did he lose his daughter no he got her back in a multiplied an even better form did he lose his dog did he lose his horse did he lose his chair so how far do we want to go you know we we can go further uh did I lose my cabin when my family sold it just temporarily God has a promise those things that everything that you loved and that loved you will be your reward and again that I've said it before but that doesn't that doesn't bypass the new birth and salvation but those things that were special to you that got taken away and sometimes God not sometimes God allows those things to be taken away for a greater purpose that we don't understand and it breaks our heart it kills us but there's a greater purpose that he has and he's going to restore every back to it anyways you you feel like I feel like we lost that my life will never be the same because of that but that's not what God speaks over us that's not what God says over our lives God says I will restore amen let's stand and pray father we thank you so much for your goodness and mercy we thank you Lord your great love for us Lord that you promise those things that we lost that we feel like we lost that have broken our heart Lord you're going to give them all back to us Lord when we get to our reward what hope that we have what joy we have knowing Lord just we need to run this race with patience father you'll you'll make all wrongs right you'll set everything in perfect order Lord and it's all through the blood of Jesus Christ and his his power to subdue not just us but all things unto himself Lord we ask your blessing upon the worship upon the preaching of the word we ask that You' be glorified in our midst in Jesus name amen God bless you
