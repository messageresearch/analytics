[35:41] either great or small but carried them
[35:45] away and went on their way
[35:47] so david and his men came to the city
[35:51] and behold it was burned with fire
[35:54] and their wives and their sons and their
[35:56] daughters were taken captive
[36:00] then david
[36:02] and
[36:02] then david and the people that were with
[36:04] him lifted up their voices and wept
[36:07] and they had no and wept until they had
[36:10] no more power to weak
[36:12] my that's what you call mourning right
[36:14] there
[36:15] they say and david and david's two wives
[36:18] were taken captives
[36:20] a hennano a hindu norm the jezreelite
[36:23] and abigail
[36:25] the wife of nabal the carmelite and
[36:27] david was greatly distressed
[36:30] for the people's spake of stoning him
[36:33] because the soul of all the people were
[36:36] grieved every man for his son
[36:39] and for his daughters but david
[36:41] encouraged himself
[36:43] in the lord god
[36:45] oh my let's go to um
[36:49] first kings
[36:52] first kings
[36:55] chapter
[36:57] 17.
[37:00] first kings chapter 17
[37:04] to make the reading show let's go to um
[37:08] let's start at verse 11.
[37:12] and as she was going to fetch it he
[37:14] called to her and said bring me i pray
[37:16] thee a morsel of bread in thine hand and
[37:19] she said as the lord thy god liveth i
[37:22] have not a cake but a handful of meal
[37:27] in a barrel and a little all
[37:30] in the curse in a cruise and
[37:33] behold i am gathering two sticks that i
[37:37] may go
[37:38] in and dress it for me and my son that
[37:40] we may
[37:41] eat it and die and elijah said unto her
[37:45] fear not go and do as
[37:48] thou has said but make
[37:50] make me there for a little cake first
[37:53] and bring it unto me and after make for
[37:57] thee and for thy son my that's a great
[38:00] request
[38:01] verse uh um
[38:04] psalms chapter 37
[38:06] verse 3.
[38:10] psalm 37 verse 3 the bible says trust in
[38:13] the lord and do good so shall thou
[38:16] so shall thou dwell in the land and
[38:21] verily thou shall be fed delight thyself
[38:25] also in the lord and he shall give thee
[38:28] thy desires the desires of thy heart
[38:31] commit thy way unto the lord trust also
[38:35] in him and he shall bring it to pass
[38:38] amen lord bless reading of his word you
[38:40] can have your seats
[38:42] you know today by the by the grace of
[38:44] god i want to use for a subject
[38:46] something very familiar to us
[38:49] but sometimes i think we need to hit the
[38:51] refresh button
[38:52] amen you know you have with a computer
[38:55] you have a computer it has everything
[38:57] there but sometimes a little uh uh
[39:00] a little something may get inside that
[39:02] they call a virus or something it may
[39:05] get inside you have to clean it and
[39:06] refresh
[39:08] everything that it that it needs is
[39:10] already there you just got to get all
[39:12] the junk out the way so sometimes
[39:14] serving the law we got to hit the
[39:15] refresh button there's nothing wrong
[39:18] with god and let me tell you sometimes
[39:19] there's nothing wrong with us but just
[39:21] the way we're perceiving things
[39:23] and sometimes you have to come and and
[39:26] just hit the reset button or refresh and
[39:29] and and whatever you're dealing with
[39:31] start all over from there but today my
[39:34] subject by the grace of god is trust in
[39:36] the lord hallelujah trust in the lord
[39:39] how many can say amen to that you know
[39:42] it takes a person to trust in lord to to
[39:45] be able to trust in god you got to have
[39:47] faith in god amen
[39:49] you know and the reason why i i read
[39:52] these scriptures is if we could just
[39:54] take psalms 37 the bible says
[39:56] delight thyself in the lord and he'll
[39:58] give you the desires of your heart
[40:01] now he's not saying come to church
[40:02] because it's a duty he's not saying sing
[40:05] songs because everybody else is singing
[40:08] he's saying let this be a part of who
[40:10] you are
[40:11] you know delight yourself in the things
[40:13] of god and he will give you the desires
[40:16] of your heart
[40:17] even when it don't look like it's it's
[40:19] moving according to your favor you have
[40:22] to delight yourself in the law
[40:25] hey man you know as as a as i look at
[40:28] the scripture let's just back up to
[40:30] david
[40:31] you know in the book of psalms you know
[40:32] david then went out to battle
[40:34] you know and
[40:36] and everybody he went to pretty much god
[40:38] gave him the victory
[40:40] but this time church the enemy snuck in
[40:43] while he was fighting hallelujah
[40:45] isn't that just like the devil when you
[40:47] serving god doing your best the enemy
[40:50] coming sneaking and trying to take your
[40:52] children
[40:53] he'll come in and mess up your job he'll
[40:55] come in and try to mess up relationships
[40:58] he's very sneaky while you're in
[41:00] position doing what you're supposed to
[41:02] do
[41:03] but one thing we got to realize about
[41:05] this scripture hallelujah the bible says
[41:07] nobody was harmed
[41:10] hallelujah amen church that's the place
[41:13] we got to be in the devil can do things
[41:15] things can happen but ultimately god is
[41:18] in control
[41:19] so we have to have a mindset as long as
[41:22] you can pray about it everything is all
[41:24] right
[41:25] hallelujah as long as you can pray about
[41:27] it at any time any moment god can change
[41:30] the situation
[41:32] but you know what what what's what's
[41:33] strange to me is that david was a man of
[41:36] the god's very own heart and the people
[41:39] knew that
[41:40] the people knew that david was a
[41:42] god-fearing man
[41:44] david had men of war standing behind him
[41:48] but in this moment not only was david
[41:51] affected but everybody that followed
[41:53] david was affected
[41:56] and now they're looking to blame
[41:58] somebody because wives have been captive
[42:01] children have been captive and all the
[42:03] different loved ones have been taken
[42:05] captive and the only one they could
[42:07] blame they're saying david we got to
[42:09] blame you because we're following you i
[42:12] thought god was in control
[42:17] hallelujah
[42:19] how often do we look for something to
[42:21] blame when we're supposed to be trusting
[42:24] in the lord
[42:26] holy
[42:27] are any of us bold enough to say god why
[42:30] are you doing this
[42:33] i blame you god
[42:36] don't we realize
[42:38] everything that happens is
[42:40] for our good
[42:43] but what happens is the reason why we
[42:44] can't see it because we're too busy
[42:47] looking at the clouds
[42:50] we're looking at the clouds
[42:52] but the knowledge of having experience
[42:55] with god there should be something in
[42:57] your life
[42:58] to encourage you to go beyond the clouds
[43:03] that's what the bible says the bible
[43:04] says the uh the people that david was
[43:07] leading all those those great men and
[43:09] and soldiers who stood by side they wept
[43:12] and they cried so much until they got in
[43:15] their minds and in their thoughts to got
[43:18] back to david that they wanted to kill
[43:20] david
[43:21] can you imagine how david felt all the
[43:24] sacrifices he's done for them all the
[43:27] wars he's fought for the people of god
[43:29] now these people he's loved are ready to
[43:32] turn their back on
[43:34] how do you think a pastor feels when you
[43:36] stay home
[43:40] do you think a song leader feels when
[43:42] he's singing and worshiping you just
[43:43] sitting there like
[43:49] [Music]
[43:51] oh my this stuff is for you hallelujah
[43:55] what god is doing is for you amen and
[43:58] you know uh one thing i love about david
[44:01] david although he was he had many
[44:04] experiences and he was a man of war
[44:07] david knew how to wait on god
[44:10] david knew how to trust in the lord no
[44:13] matter what it looked like
[44:15] can you imagine both of his wives are
[44:17] gone
[44:19] children being taken captive no doubt
[44:21] people in this camp that he loves
[44:24] children that probably came up and said
[44:26] oh hey king david killed him that he
[44:28] knew by name they were taken so david
[44:31] was hurting too
[44:35] but the consolation of it is church the
[44:37] bible says nobody was harmed
[44:41] oh hallelujah you take a loved one a
[44:44] child or a family member whoever goes
[44:46] out in the world to us it looks like
[44:49] they're in a bad situation but the bible
[44:51] says nobody was harmed
[44:54] why because god is shaping and molding
[44:57] hallelujah to fit his will
[45:01] we have to stop looking at things
[45:02] through a natural eye
[45:04] hallelujah god is in control amen and
[45:08] you know church let me read you let me
[45:09] read you a quote real quick hallelujah
[45:11] you know
[45:14] you know as i was thinking about uh
[45:15] trust
[45:16] and you know how we got to have
[45:19] faith a level of faith and trust now
[45:21] this quote i'm going to read i forgot to
[45:22] send it to you brothers but it's in the
[45:24] message of the the the junction time
[45:28] uh
[45:28] 56
[45:30] it's going to start at paragraph 36
[45:33] but i'm going to kind of break in at the
[45:35] end of it
[45:37] trust
[45:38] in the lord
[45:40] everybody say with me trust
[45:42] in the lord
[45:44] now i'm feeling i'm gonna throw
[45:46] i'm gonna throw a fastball at you real
[45:48] quick
[45:49] and i'm gonna throw this to the people
[45:50] who are at home who should have been
[45:52] here
[45:54] real quick
[45:57] reason why some people didn't come this
[45:58] morning because of the rain
[46:02] they were looking at circumstances and
[46:04] situations
[46:05] and they let circumcision situations
[46:08] stop them hallelujah from reaching their
[46:10] goal
[46:12] hallelujah when some of us were like hey
[46:14] it's raining but hey i got to go i got
[46:16] to get there
[46:17] it's raining but you know god is in
[46:19] control hallelujah i'm going to trust in
[46:21] the lord
[46:22] we're not trusting in our vehicles we're
[46:25] not trusting in the in how good we can
[46:27] drive what we're trusting is that our
[46:30] god is our protector
[46:32] hallelujah but if you're not careful
[46:35] you'll get an economy and you put your
[46:37] trust on your own human ability that's
[46:40] what some people did this morning
[46:44] they put their trust in their own human
[46:46] ability well i don't drive good in the
[46:48] rain
[46:49] i thought we were trusting in the lord
[46:56] still love you now don't cut me off
[46:59] i know some of you say man this is live
[47:01] i wish i could skip this part
[47:04] too bad
[47:06] hallelujah
[47:08] but you know it's too often church we
[47:10] live in the realm of the five senses
[47:12] when god is trying to get us to live in
[47:14] the realm of faith
[47:16] holly in the supersense amen you know
[47:18] let me read this church
[47:20] he says at the last part of this quote
[47:23] he says god reveals himself
[47:26] the way he wants to
[47:28] to to to people
[47:30] he wants to listen to that god reveals
[47:32] himself the way he wants to
[47:35] to people the way he wants to now let me
[47:38] explain to you how god revealed himself
[47:41] to me
[47:42] now when my parents got saved hallelujah
[47:44] they came into this message they were
[47:46] they were going to church in the
[47:48] basement of one of the saints house
[47:50] because it was all new and fresh i think
[47:52] 1984-83 something like that it was new
[47:55] and fresh and they didn't have a church
[47:57] so they was coming out of pentecost to
[47:59] church amen so they was meeting in one
[48:01] of the saints basement and you know my
[48:03] mom used to say hey son you're going to

[49:34] that
[49:36] she said you can come as you are let's
[49:38] clear that up
[49:40] that's what people love to say they love
[49:41] to use that say well god says come as
[49:44] you are amen come his dial amen but he's
[49:48] saying that but he's really meaning come
[49:51] but don't remain in that condition
[49:54] hallelujah that's what too many people
[49:56] do they come to church and they never
[49:58] get converted they never get any joy
[50:01] they never get any healing they never
[50:03] grow in god but they in church
[50:08] yeah we want you to come as you are but
[50:10] we want you to change
[50:13] we don't want you to remain in that
[50:15] condition we want you to grow in grace
[50:18] did you hear me church when you come to
[50:20] church what is god doing he's helping
[50:23] you to grow in
[50:24] grace
[50:26] what we're experiencing this morning is
[50:28] a level of grace
[50:36] get brother matt my jacket just now i
[50:37] felt the devil swing at me in the spirit
[50:41] hallelujah but she keep going on and she
[50:44] said son you going to church going to
[50:45] church like now i ain't going i ain't
[50:47] going
[50:48] so she just prayed and prayed and prayed
[50:50] and prayed for me now he says
[50:53] we get into this quote
[50:54] i hope you guys can find it
[50:56] but he said god reveals himself the way
[50:59] he wants to
[51:00] to people he wants to
[51:03] now my mom her way of god revealing
[51:05] himself to me was for her to keep asking
[51:08] me to come to church and maybe i'll hear
[51:10] something the preacher is saying and
[51:12] i'll get converted
[51:14] but god's way
[51:15] that he was gonna introduce himself to
[51:18] me was to allow me to get cancer in my
[51:20] brain
[51:22] [Music]
[51:24] hallelujah
[51:28] he reveals himself the way he wants to
[51:31] holy church i never made it to the
[51:34] basement hallelujah
[51:35] as many times they had church i never
[51:38] made it there but god in his sovereign
[51:40] way he was he was basically hallelujah
[51:43] he had a plan
[51:44] which my mom didn't really understand
[51:46] but she had to trust in god hallelujah
[51:49] so she prayed and prayed and kept
[51:51] praying god says okay i'mma get him
[51:53] there but i'm gonna give him the way
[51:54] nobody's expecting hallelujah i'm gonna
[51:57] allow him to have cancer in his brain
[51:59] and what cats is gonna do cass is gonna
[52:02] bring up one of my attributes hallelujah
[52:04] because i placed in him before the
[52:06] foundation of the world a revelation
[52:09] called jehovah russia
[52:14] and it took cancer to bring that piece
[52:16] of god out that was there
[52:19] hallelujah it took character hallelujah
[52:22] to reveal the goodness of god in my life
[52:29] but if you're not trusting in god you
[52:31] panic
[52:32] oh lord my job's gonna die no this is
[52:35] just the introduction
[52:40] hallelujah
[52:41] so god introduced himself
[52:44] through the to me by the way of
[52:46] by the way of cancer
[52:49] isn't that something
[52:50] god used something that the devil
[52:52] thought was strong
[52:54] and used it to make me strong
[52:58] because you know what hallelujah
[53:00] just like david them
[53:02] even though i had cancer
[53:04] nobody was hurt
[53:08] i got stronger in grace
[53:11] god introduced himself hallelujah
[53:13] and not only through cancer
[53:15] my faith was quickened hallelujah
[53:18] because i had to i in life i had to
[53:21] learn personally myself to trust in god
[53:24] because they said okay now you got to
[53:26] take cause you got you got a brain tumor
[53:29] it's running through your body we gonna
[53:30] get what we can get y'all to heard this
[53:32] testimony before but i i believe it's
[53:33] for somebody
[53:35] amen he says he said she said they said
[53:38] the doctors say hey uh we need him to do
[53:41] chemo and radiation because once we
[53:43] start the cutting the cancer is going to
[53:45] spread hallelujah
[53:47] so they they they acknowledge the cancer
[53:49] they begin to tell a story about if you
[53:51] don't take this this is gonna happen you
[53:53] don't take that just go have it all the
[53:55] stuff they were telling me is in the
[53:56] natural realm
[54:00] but my mother trusting in god she comes
[54:02] into the room with the word hallelujah
[54:05] she comes in with the message hallelujah
[54:08] and now she's trusting in god how she's
[54:11] introducing me into the scripture
[54:14] she's introducing me to isaiah 53
[54:16] hallelujah let me tell you something the
[54:19] word of god will never return to you
[54:22] lord
[54:24] if you speak the word it has to
[54:27] accomplish what that word was sent out
[54:29] for
[54:30] can i get amen
[54:32] hallelujah i'm talking to you children
[54:34] of god when you speak the word it has to
[54:37] accomplish what you spoken for
[54:41] amen are we not god's people
[54:44] hallelujah did we not have a messenger
[54:47] that came and restored the power of the
[54:49] spoken word back in the church
[54:53] hallelujah
[54:55] so when we speak we have to learn to
[54:57] just sit back and wait and trust in god
[55:00] and let him finish hallelujah the work
[55:03] now it might not look like it's anything
[55:05] taking place
[55:06] but we're not dealing with looks
[55:09] hallelujah
[55:11] some of you may look at your spouse and
[55:12] be like
[55:13] man i got the beautifulest thing in the
[55:16] world
[55:17] and somebody else may be looking at your
[55:18] spouse like what in the world they
[55:20] seeing them
[55:24] we're not dealing with looks
[55:28] we're dealing with compatibility
[55:31] in church we are compatible with the
[55:34] message of the seventh church age angel
[55:37] hallelujah we are compatible with the
[55:39] opening of the seals no they're not
[55:41] closed they're open hallelujah we're
[55:44] compatible amen with the revelation of
[55:46] the seven church ages and let me tell
[55:48] you some church there's another church
[55:51] age amen hallelujah
[55:55] they're looking at me oh my god he's off
[55:56] on the scripture
[55:59] he says there's another church age yes
[56:01] we're living in it what is it it's
[56:03] called the bride age
[56:05] hallelujah church we're living in the
[56:07] eighth day amen we're not stuck in light

[56:22] time the bride is supposed to be living
[56:24] in church we have to catch it god sent
[56:27] the messenger and he gave us a paradigm
[56:29] shift we're not living in a huddle a
[56:31] church age holding a wicked church now
[56:34] we're living alone with god
[56:38] remember he comes in he says i no longer

[1:01:17] double master next thing you know
[1:01:19] they're gonna be walking around with ski
[1:01:20] masks on
[1:01:24] why because the atmosphere of fear
[1:01:28] let me explain something by the grace
[1:01:30] yes people are getting sick
[1:01:32] but the spirit hasn't changed
[1:01:36] it's still the same old spirit
[1:01:39] what's making this stronger fear

[1:02:05] know what i'm living by god is my
[1:02:06] protector
[1:02:09] hallelujah but you know what reasoning
[1:02:11] nowadays where people take the scripture
[1:02:14] and reason with god being my protector
[1:02:17] i say yes god my protector and then
[1:02:18] they'll come back and say but yeah you
[1:02:20] don't want to tempt the lord
[1:02:23] i'm tempting god by asking him to
[1:02:25] protect me
[1:02:29] hey do what do whatever you pass to tell
[1:02:31] you
[1:02:34] don't follow brother diggs
[1:02:36] hallelujah because it's an individual
[1:02:37] journey what i'm saying is don't live in
[1:02:40] fear you've got to trust in the lord
[1:02:42] hollywood church where do we see whether
[1:02:45] we see the scripture where man lost his
[1:02:47] faith and trust in god
[1:02:49] holy in the book of genesis amen i
[1:02:52] believe they had faith in god they
[1:02:54] listened to the voice of god god would
[1:02:56] come down in the cool of the day they
[1:02:58] never were afraid they trusted in
[1:03:00] god
[1:03:02] they had their lives in god's hand they
[1:03:04] could stand before god naked and not be
[1:03:07] ashamed
[1:03:08] because they knew god would never harm
[1:03:10] them but as soon as they got from behind
[1:03:13] the word and did the wrong thing god in
[1:03:16] his faithfulness came down like he
[1:03:18] always did god never changed
[1:03:22] but they lost their trust in him
[1:03:26] they lost their faith in him
[1:03:28] what was it it was fear
[1:03:34] fear was one of the
[1:03:36] what oh my
[1:03:37] fear was one of the first attributes
[1:03:40] manifested in the garden
[1:03:46] because they went from having service
[1:03:48] and worshipping the lord to now listen
[1:03:50] listen to what they say about god
[1:03:53] they're they're giving an expression to
[1:03:55] god
[1:03:56] that's not even worthy of any action
[1:03:58] he's ever committed
[1:04:01] they said god says adam adam where i vow
[1:04:05] and then they say
[1:04:07] we heard your voice
[1:04:09] and we were afraid
[1:04:12] well let me ask you something did his
[1:04:14] voice change
[1:04:18] his voice didn't change
[1:04:20] what changed their position in christ
[1:04:24] holy so their position in christ
[1:04:26] hallelujah changed the outlook on the
[1:04:29] mercy and grace of god that he had given
[1:04:32] them
[1:04:34] and a lot of times the life you live is
[1:04:37] what makes you afraid of approaching god
[1:04:40] [Applause]
[1:04:44] if you're not careful the devil keep you
[1:04:46] off into that holy because you got fear
[1:04:50] and that's a tool that satan lou uses
[1:04:53] from day one of the book of genesis he
[1:04:56] let fear come on the people and fear was
[1:04:59] the very thing that kept him separated
[1:05:01] from god's presence
[1:05:03] but it wasn't god it was them
[1:05:06] even though they messed up god would
[1:05:08] remain faithful hallelujah and he always
[1:05:11] kept coming even think about a church
[1:05:13] they could be an adulterer they eve
[1:05:15] committed adultery they took us a
[1:05:17] forbidden act and god and his
[1:05:19] faithfulness still came down and called
[1:05:22] their name
[1:05:24] how many of us we were in bars drinking
[1:05:27] and smoking and some of us cussing and
[1:05:29] lying and cheating and stealing and in
[1:05:31] that condition god still called our name
[1:05:37] isn't he faithful
[1:05:39] god doesn't let the conditions of your
[1:05:41] life stop that seed from coming to life
[1:05:48] and i'll be the first one to say
[1:05:52] if god saved me
[1:05:55] he can save anybody
[1:05:59] hallelujah
[1:06:01] i had my first experience with god
[1:06:04] like i was just saying when i had cancer
[1:06:06] you know i was 15 years old
[1:06:08] so you can't tell me as a teenager god
[1:06:11] ain't dealing with you
[1:06:13] it's whether you want to surrender or
[1:06:15] not
[1:06:16] hallelujah and let me say this parents
[1:06:19] don't be like job
[1:06:20] the reason why job went through he went
[1:06:22] through hallelujah went through what he
[1:06:24] went through is because he had fear in
[1:06:26] his life
[1:06:28] look he was offering a sacrifice every
[1:06:30] day why because he was afraid
[1:06:37] you said brothers what are you talking
[1:06:38] about listen
[1:06:39] through the interpretation of that
[1:06:41] scripture through a vindicated prophet
[1:06:43] he said the very thing job feared came
[1:06:46] upon him
[1:06:48] and you notice what job offered that
[1:06:50] sacrifice he said pre-adventure one of
[1:06:52] my children may sin in a heart
[1:06:55] prevention one of my children may speak
[1:06:56] against you lord i'm gonna keep this
[1:06:58] token of the blood here
[1:07:02] so the very thing that was motivating
[1:07:03] him was fear
[1:07:06] oh my
[1:07:08] what if he was just stood back and trust
[1:07:09] the lord and say lord
[1:07:11] whatever your will is
[1:07:13] whatever your will is let it be
[1:07:17] we don't pray we don't pray like that
[1:07:19] because we don't want the struggle
[1:07:22] because you know some of us we gonna
[1:07:24] fight and fight and kick and scream
[1:07:26] but y'all know the holy spirit is like a
[1:07:28] bounty hunter
[1:07:31] you ever seen them all cowboy pictures
[1:07:33] hey i know somebody about to cut me off
[1:07:34] why you keep talking about tv and
[1:07:36] television
[1:07:40] cause you got one
[1:07:48] but you you know in those old pictures
[1:07:51] the sheriff or the bounty hunter
[1:07:53] he would have a picture of that person
[1:07:56] and he wasn't going to get that person
[1:07:58] without a reward being offered first
[1:08:01] so what he'd have the picture he'd find
[1:08:03] the person and say look i'm so-and-so
[1:08:05] i'm a bounty hunter i come to get you
[1:08:07] and look this is what you we know what
[1:08:09] you did
[1:08:10] now there's two things you can do
[1:08:12] there's two things gonna happen here
[1:08:14] you can come quietly just let me cuff
[1:08:17] you up
[1:08:18] and we go back together
[1:08:20] or
[1:08:22] i can pistol whip you tie you up and
[1:08:25] drag you behind this horse
[1:08:27] but either way you coming
[1:08:30] now some of us came quietly
[1:08:32] but some of us
[1:08:35] some of us had to be beaten whip tied up
[1:08:42] i believe duct tape was invented for
[1:08:44] some of us
[1:08:51] dragged
[1:08:52] but then you got back to the place where
[1:08:54] you could be held accountable
[1:08:56] think about the church all god is trying
[1:08:58] to do is get us to a place where we can
[1:09:00] be held accountable
[1:09:02] and once you're held accountable
[1:09:03] hallelujah there's two things that
[1:09:05] becomes a weapon in your hand that'll
[1:09:08] give you power unlimited power hollywood
[1:09:11] y'all listen to me good there's two
[1:09:12] things that you possess we possess as
[1:09:14] people that can give us unlimited power
[1:09:17] and status with god the prophet of god
[1:09:19] said let me let me finish reading holly
[1:09:21] hallelujah
[1:09:23] listen
[1:09:24] let me finish reading this quote and
[1:09:25] i'll get back to it he says
[1:09:29] uh
[1:09:30] god reveals himself the way he wants to
[1:09:33] to the people he wants to it's his
[1:09:35] sovereign will
[1:09:36] he hardens who he hardens and justifies
[1:09:40] who he justifies it lays in god's hands
[1:09:43] not in my hands on your hands it lays in
[1:09:47] god's hands to what he will do
[1:09:50] the bible said do you realize that honey
[1:09:54] now listen this is this is i believe you
[1:09:56] guys got this this is a life story amen
[1:09:59] 51 he says now there's a perfect will
[1:10:03] and a permissive will
[1:10:04] and i feel that if god
[1:10:07] here on the platform can show me things
[1:10:09] that has been and in the rooms and so
[1:10:11] forth he's able to tell me
[1:10:14] just where he wants me and what he wants
[1:10:18] me to do
[1:10:19] but if i feel as long as i've got it all
[1:10:23] hooked up
[1:10:25] you ever felt like that
[1:10:27] he said as long as i feel like i've got
[1:10:29] it all hooked up
[1:10:31] i feel like then he won't pull his hand
[1:10:34] on it he won't put his hand on it as
[1:10:36] long as i'm doing it
[1:10:39] now i'm finna give you a weapon pay
[1:10:41] attention
[1:10:43] holly i'm i'm gonna give you something
[1:10:45] today that's greater than an atomic bomb
[1:10:49] i'm gonna give you something that's
[1:10:50] faster than a uzi
[1:10:53] hallelujah
[1:10:54] he says
[1:10:55] and that's the way it is he's saying
[1:10:58] that's the way it is anything as long as
[1:11:01] you're going to do it
[1:11:03] if someone talks about you and they talk
[1:11:05] they
[1:11:06] they talk back about them you talk back
[1:11:08] about them god can't fight your battle
[1:11:12] you're fighting it yourself
[1:11:14] see
[1:11:15] just let loose
[1:11:17] and let him do it what does that mean if
[1:11:19] you let loose and let him do it what are
[1:11:21] we doing
[1:11:22] trusting in the lord
[1:11:28] he said
[1:11:30] and just hit him a weapon
[1:11:32] and just commit it to him
[1:11:36] some of y'all ain't catch that weapon
[1:11:41] that's a weapon anybody can hold that's
[1:11:43] right
[1:11:44] a five-year-old in here can
[1:11:46] operate in that weapon
[1:11:48] a teenager in here can operate in that
[1:11:50] weapon
[1:11:52] uh a mourning parent can operate in that
[1:11:54] weapon he says don't fight it yourself
[1:11:57] just commit it to god
[1:12:00] what does he mean how do you commit it
[1:12:02] you pray about it and say god i gave it
[1:12:04] to you
[1:12:10] in the same illustration in a different
[1:12:12] message he said what does a a farmer do
[1:12:16] he plants the seed and then he just
[1:12:18] waits
[1:12:19] he knows what he's planted and then he
[1:12:22] just waits hallelujah if he goes back
[1:12:24] and dig it up it'll never grow
[1:12:28] what is he doing when he digs it up he's
[1:12:30] putting his hands on it
[1:12:33] commit it and leave it alone just
[1:12:36] understand hallelujah and know what you
[1:12:38] planted
[1:12:41] and in your spiritual vision there is
[1:12:44] something you ought to be looking for
[1:12:46] once you committed to god
[1:12:50] are you with me church
[1:12:52] i know this message is kind of personal
[1:12:54] this morning but that's the way it has
[1:12:56] to be
[1:12:58] hallelujah
[1:12:59] christmas is over with we're no longer
[1:13:01] under the mistletoe
[1:13:07] it's back to real life again
[1:13:10] no more jingle bells
[1:13:16] hallelujah says committed to him
[1:13:20] the greatest weapon that i know of
[1:13:23] of a christian today
[1:13:25] is a communal god
[1:13:27] when you can when you can do nothing
[1:13:30] about it just commit it to him
[1:13:33] and god will take care of it
[1:13:35] and in another message i ain't got time
[1:13:37] to read it he said the greatest weapon
[1:13:39] is a communal and a confession
[1:13:46] and a confession
[1:13:49] i'll say it again as a confession
[1:13:52] young people you want to know how to
[1:13:54] overcome that thing that's bothering you
[1:13:56] confess it to god
[1:13:58] say lord this thing is out of control in
[1:14:01] my life i need your help
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:08] because god can't touch it until you
[1:14:10] tell him you don't want it no more
[1:14:14] you know the prophet god said god is not
[1:14:15] a brute
[1:14:17] he's not going to force you to do
[1:14:18] anything
[1:14:19] he wants you to have enough confidence
[1:14:21] in him to hallelujah give him that
[1:14:23] pornography
[1:14:26] hallelujah
[1:14:27] he wants you to have enough trust in him
[1:14:30] to give him that anxiety
[1:14:32] i feel a spirit of fear
[1:14:35] why are you afraid
[1:14:38] did you know the devil is telling you
[1:14:39] say it's just your nerves

[1:15:59] and rosie spoke that a spirit of fear
[1:16:02] came on
[1:16:06] oh my god now let me ask you a question
[1:16:09] was he not a prophet after that
[1:16:13] he was still a prophet
[1:16:15] now what i'm saying to you you may have
[1:16:17] used god man's use you supernaturally
[1:16:19] and things have happened but now you're
[1:16:21] in a shaky area that doesn't mean you're
[1:16:23] not a child of god
[1:16:26] holy you could be in a stinky situation
[1:16:29] that doesn't mean hallelujah that your
[1:16:31] status has changed in the kingdom of
[1:16:33] heaven
[1:16:34] oh yeah
[1:16:36] even though he's just saying ain't gonna
[1:16:38] rain to i call for it jezebel said i'm
[1:16:40] gonna kill you he's like
[1:16:44] we're running from his life and just
[1:16:45] shut up the heavens
[1:16:51] that fear is something else boy
[1:16:53] hallelujah
[1:16:55] look church let me go back a little bit
[1:16:57] dude we're dealing with this fear a
[1:16:58] little bit i don't know why we keep
[1:16:59] going there but god trying to break the
[1:17:01] spirit of fear in here this morning
[1:17:03] church look at it job hallelujah the
[1:17:06] thief that came upon him
[1:17:08] through the interpretation of the of the
[1:17:10] prophet of god he said it was what he
[1:17:12] feared
[1:17:14] but let's look at how god looked at him
[1:17:16] when satan came and he said uh uh uh
[1:17:19] he's walking to a fro and the lord says
[1:17:22] satan what are you doing here he said
[1:17:24] i'm just i'm just walking around trying
[1:17:26] to test somebody
[1:17:28] i'm walking around here trying to mess
[1:17:30] up somebody moment
[1:17:32] but god had everybody protected whoa
[1:17:36] think about it church satan is walking
[1:17:38] around your family but he can't do
[1:17:40] nothing but what god allows
[1:17:42] and you're going through something god
[1:17:44] has allowed it what does that mean he's
[1:17:47] in control
[1:17:52] hallelujah
[1:17:53] because satan can't put his hand on it
[1:17:55] unless god allows it so if god allows it
[1:17:59] there is a purpose
[1:18:06] hallelujah
[1:18:08] church and now job the devil comes he
[1:18:10] says hey he says
[1:18:13] he said have you considered my servant
[1:18:15] have you considered my servant job
[1:18:19] satan says of course i have
[1:18:22] i want him bad
[1:18:24] because he looks like he's happy
[1:18:27] serving you

[1:18:33] i've been i've been

[1:18:51] yeah i know tony with me tony i feel
[1:18:53] like damn damn

[1:19:03] messed up right now

[1:27:41] heavens there's no rain next minute he's
[1:27:43] running for his life
[1:27:45] god said go over here and i'ma i'mma
[1:27:47] sustain you he goes over there god sends
[1:27:49] a raven hallelujah
[1:27:52] ain't even a bird that has any kind of
[1:27:55] spiritual type
[1:28:00] god you something raggedy huh
[1:28:02] oh my
[1:28:04] god use something that'll never have any
[1:28:06] spiritual application of good in the
[1:28:08] kingdom to sustain his prophet
[1:28:11] oh my god can do what he want to do
[1:28:14] because remember hallelujah i believe it
[1:28:16] was a raven and it was a dove hallelujah
[1:28:19] on the ark amen
[1:28:21] hallelujah the raven went out and went
[1:28:23] wow
[1:28:25] and the dove came back why because the
[1:28:27] dove was a clean bird it was a type of
[1:28:29] spiritual things now god is going to use
[1:28:32] hallelujah this black dark raven
[1:28:34] hallelujah to help out a spiritual thing
[1:28:40] that's what he may do hallelujah he'll
[1:28:42] let the dark areas of your life and
[1:28:44] times of your life to become a spiritual
[1:28:47] thing
[1:28:51] in this dark time of elijah's life where
[1:28:54] he's feared everything god use the raven
[1:28:56] not a dove
[1:29:00] he can do what he want to do
[1:29:03] but then god says go over here and i'm
[1:29:04] gonna sustain you
[1:29:06] but then
[1:29:07] the brook dries up all this stuff
[1:29:08] happens now god told him said go down
[1:29:11] this way i got a woman
[1:29:12] she gonna help you out
[1:29:14] y'all know i'm paraphrasing
[1:29:16] but look
[1:29:18] when he gets there
[1:29:20] the woman ain't got enough but just for
[1:29:22] herself
[1:29:25] so what does elijah do
[1:29:27] he has to trust in what god said
[1:29:31] because he go by his natural eyes
[1:29:34] she only got enough for what two cakes
[1:29:37] one for her one for her son and she told

[1:29:43] me and my son we're gonna eat it we're
[1:29:44] gonna die

[1:29:47] if he was in a carnal rim he'll be like
[1:29:50] but lord you told me to come here you
[1:29:52] told me you was gonna sustain me we're
[1:29:54] not dealing with what we can see in the
[1:29:56] natural realm
[1:29:57] we're dealing with the promises of god
[1:30:01] if god said it he can fulfill it
[1:30:04] if god told you to wait on him you wait
[1:30:06] on him if god told you to commit it to
[1:30:09] his hands and he'll take care of it
[1:30:11] commit it and don't look back

[1:37:16] what time it is
[1:37:20] oh jesus
[1:37:22] jesus
[1:37:24] listen
[1:37:26] trust
[1:37:28] trust comes in two formats
[1:37:30] in the format of a verb and in the
[1:37:32] format as a noun let's look at trusting
[1:37:35] god in the format of a noun we know that
[1:37:38] now there's a person place a thing amen
[1:37:40] but we're trusting what a person
[1:37:43] we're not trusting i think we're
[1:37:44] trusting a person what are we trusting
[1:37:47] hallelujah trust means as a now assured
[1:37:50] reliance on the character hallelujah
[1:37:54] we're trusting the character of god
[1:37:57] hallelujah god can never be defeated he
[1:38:01] can never come up short hallelujah if
[1:38:03] you need joy he gives you joy if you
[1:38:05] need peace he gives you peace that's
[1:38:08] just who his character is
[1:38:10] that's what we're trusting hallelujah he
[1:38:13] says trust amen reliance on the
[1:38:16] character ability strength hallelujah
[1:38:20] god's ability with god all things are
[1:38:23] possible
[1:38:25] look at your situation right now why are
[1:38:27] you trusting him because all things are
[1:38:30] possible
[1:38:32] amen
[1:38:33] what are we trusting in his strength
[1:38:36] amen god can never be defeated
[1:38:40] holy hezekiah trusted in the lord he
[1:38:44] took the letter and spread it out before
[1:38:46] the lord amen and say god the king of
[1:38:48] syria is saying don't trust in you and
[1:38:50] the lord said he will not come into the
[1:38:53] kingdom
[1:38:54] he said one angel and the angel
[1:38:56] destroyed the whole syrian army
[1:39:00] why because that's his strength
[1:39:03] that's what we're trusting in
[1:39:05] hallelujah
[1:39:06] it says or as a noun now or truth of
[1:39:10] someone or something do we have truth
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:16] so when you apply the word to your
[1:39:18] situation
[1:39:19] you're trusting in the truth of god's
[1:39:22] word
[1:39:24] he says by stripes you're healed that's
[1:39:26] truth
[1:39:28] if he says you're the head and not to
[1:39:29] tell that's truth if he says bring to my
[1:39:32] storehouse first and see if i won't open
[1:39:34] the windows he says prove me
[1:39:38] and then the verse of that he says i see
[1:39:40] if i won't rebuke the devour
[1:39:42] i'll take care of that very thing that's
[1:39:44] hindering your finances
[1:39:45] [Music]
[1:39:51] see this is reality to me amen because i
[1:39:53] fight so hard
[1:39:55] just to stay afloat

[1:44:44] ain't got it don't worry about it god
[1:44:46] got it
[1:44:48] amen he says a place in one's care to
[1:44:52] place confidence
[1:44:55] whoa
[1:44:56] that's where i'm closing church
[1:45:00] davis trust was an action
[1:45:03] confidence what did david do harley
[1:45:05] all of his wives were gone children were
[1:45:07] gone but he had trust in god to place
[1:45:10] confidence that everything was all right
[1:45:13] how did he why was he confident the
[1:45:15] bible says that david encouraged himself
[1:45:18] that's when you got confidence in god
[1:45:20] you fall back on what he's done
[1:45:22] hallelujah you fall back and you say
[1:45:25] lord i remember when
[1:45:28] hallelujah church when things get tight
[1:45:30] hallelujah i fall back and i say lord i
[1:45:33] remember when the police stopped me i
[1:45:35] remember when when the clerk gave me
[1:45:37] something free i remember
[1:45:40] and you let those testimonies encourage
[1:45:42] you to keep trusting in the lord
[1:45:50] david encouraged himself and he waited
[1:45:52] for the lord to tell him to go did he go
[1:45:55] and get everything that belonged to him
[1:45:58] amen
[1:46:02] that was just a mere test
[1:46:05] and there's some things we're going
[1:46:06] through that's just a mere test
[1:46:10] some tests are longer than others
[1:46:13] and what i'm finding out
[1:46:16] sometimes the length of the test
[1:46:18] determines your attitude
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:24] he know you ain't there yet so he let
[1:46:26] that thing linger and linger and linger
[1:46:29] especially with dealing with people
[1:46:32] the ultimate test when you're dealing
[1:46:33] with people
[1:46:34] is for you to come out of that test with
[1:46:36] perfect love
[1:46:40] especially in your church
[1:46:42] especially in your family when you can
[1:46:44] love someone unconditional no matter
[1:46:47] what they didn't did for you
[1:46:49] one time my pastor dropped the bomb on
[1:46:50] the church he says hey we all say we
[1:46:53] forgive somebody
[1:46:54] and then you say well i forgive i forgot
[1:46:56] i won't forget but then you come and you
[1:46:58] become a christian and you say well i i
[1:47:00] got to forgive because god wants us to
[1:47:02] love everybody he says whenever you see
[1:47:04] that person and whatever they did to you
[1:47:07] comes back to your memory you ain't
[1:47:09] forgave them
[1:47:14] oh oh
[1:47:17] look like we didn't hit a little spot
[1:47:18] there
[1:47:21] no no i didn't forgave them i just don't
[1:47:24] deal with them you don't deal with them
[1:47:25] because every time you think about it
[1:47:26] you think about what they did to you
[1:47:29] you got to conquer that thing you got to
[1:47:31] give that to god and say lord take this
[1:47:33] out of my heart
[1:47:35] that when i see them i can just
[1:47:36] appreciate them as a brother or sister
[1:47:39] no matter what they did
[1:47:40] prime example jesus christ saying father
[1:47:43] forgive them for what they did
[1:47:45] and then turn right back around and
[1:47:47] place them back in the covenant
[1:47:52] that's what you call some forgiveness oh
[1:47:55] my let the same people you love crucify
[1:47:57] you kill you amen then turn back around
[1:48:00] and say i'ma give them another day of
[1:48:02] grace
[1:48:09] anybody trusting in the lord
[1:48:12] church it ain't gonna get no better down
[1:48:14] here
[1:48:16] as far as living in this world
[1:48:18] it ain't gonna get no better things are
[1:48:20] gonna get tougher
[1:48:23] we got to trust in the lord
[1:48:25] let's not try to reason ourselves around
[1:48:27] the scripture
[1:48:29] no let's meet it head on
[1:48:31] and if there's something you don't
[1:48:32] understand don't try to reason away just
[1:48:34] put it in god's hands
[1:48:36] and wait on the lord
[1:48:38] don't discount it ah that just came from
[1:48:40] brother matt you know brother matt i
[1:48:42] always hit those kind of issues
[1:48:47] god use them that way because he wants
[1:48:49] to deal personally with you
[1:48:51] because he knows you can't stand to hear
[1:48:53] brother matt talking about that issue
[1:48:56] so god gonna anoint brother matt to talk
[1:48:58] about that issue every time you come to
[1:49:00] church
[1:49:02] because he's trying to get you to
[1:49:03] conquer something
[1:49:05] hallelujah
[1:49:07] anybody growing in christ
[1:49:10] trust me hallelujah i ain't got it all
[1:49:12] made up hallelujah i ain't got it all

[1:49:52] hallelujah

[1:49:55] people pray for the parents because one
[1:49:57] thing about satan whatever avenue he can

[1:50:01] permission
[1:50:03] hallelujah but one thing about god god
[1:50:05] is so confident
[1:50:07] in his in his children and in what he's
[1:50:09] placed in us he'll let the devil have it

[2:04:25] the lord it's so incredible brother
[2:04:27] diggs what you were
[2:04:29] speaking on
[2:04:30] um just in devotions yesterday
[2:04:34] uh me and rachel was just driving to
[2:04:36] charleston going to get some church
[2:04:37] supplies and
[2:04:38] and rachel was just sharing me with me a
[2:04:41] january 13th little book that she has
[2:04:43] streams in the desert that she uh she
[2:04:45] reads from and it's just so incredible
[2:04:48] what was spoken today because brother
[2:04:50] diggs was talking about how that your
[2:04:52] trials and the tests that god put you
[2:04:54] through that it was cancer even brother
[2:04:56] dick said i don't say that was the devil
[2:04:58] who gave that to me
[2:04:59] but god
[2:05:00] his mom wanted him to go to his church
[2:05:02] so god put cancer in his life and god
[2:05:04] what god did was god took what the devil
[2:05:08] just as joseph said what you meant for
[2:05:10] evil
[2:05:12] god is used for good yeah
[2:05:14] and so what god can do is he can take
[2:05:16] the satan doesn't realize it that the
[2:05:19] very attacks that he launches on god's
[2:05:21] family is the tool that god uses to
[2:05:24] bring strength to your life
[2:05:27] i mean it's so powerful just felt i
[2:05:28] wanted to read this this was so good it
[2:05:31] quotes romans 8 you can display it on
[2:05:33] the screen romans 8 37 and all these
[2:05:36] things we are more than conquerors
[2:05:39] through him that loved us
[2:05:42] says this is more you can you can make
[2:05:45] that full screen and then command plus
[2:05:47] so zoom it in
[2:05:49] make it full screen first though before
[2:05:51] you do that i want everybody to be able
[2:05:52] to read that listen what he says he says
[2:05:54] this is more
[2:05:56] more than victory
[2:05:58] this is a triumph so complete that we
[2:06:02] have not only escaped defeat and
[2:06:04] destruction but we have destroyed our
[2:06:07] enemies
[2:06:08] and won a spoil so rich and valuable
[2:06:11] that we can thank god that the battle
[2:06:14] ever came
[2:06:15] how can we be more than conquerors you
[2:06:18] ever thought about that you're more than
[2:06:19] conquerors how can you be more than a
[2:06:21] conqueror
[2:06:22] we can get out of the conflict a
[2:06:24] spiritual discipline
[2:06:27] that will greatly strengthen our faith
[2:06:29] and establish our spiritual character
[2:06:31] temptation is necessary to settle and
[2:06:34] confirm us in the spiritual life
[2:06:37] it is like the fire which burns in the
[2:06:39] colors of mineral painting or like winds
[2:06:42] that cause the mighty cedars of the
[2:06:44] mountain to strike more deeply into the
[2:06:46] soil
[2:06:47] our spiritual conflicts are among our
[2:06:50] choicest blessings
[2:06:52] and our great adversary is used think
[2:06:55] about this
[2:06:56] to train us for his ultimate defeat
[2:07:00] what is god going to use us to train us
[2:07:02] to defeat the devil the attacks the
[2:07:04] devil launches in our life
[2:07:07] he says the ancient figurines had a
[2:07:09] legend that every time they conquered an
[2:07:11] enemy the victor absorbed the physical
[2:07:14] strength of his victim and added so much
[2:07:16] to his own strength and valor so
[2:07:18] temptation victoriously met doubles our
[2:07:22] spiritual strength and equipment it is
[2:07:25] possible thus not only to defeat our
[2:07:27] enemy but to capture him and make him
[2:07:30] fight in our ranks
[2:07:32] listen to this the prophet isaiah speaks
[2:07:35] of flying on the shoulders of the
[2:07:36] philistines these philistines were their
[2:07:39] deadly foes
[2:07:40] but the figure suggested that they would
[2:07:42] be enabled not only to conquer the
[2:07:44] philistines
[2:07:46] but to use them to carry the victors on
[2:07:48] their shoulders for further triumphs
[2:07:51] just as the wise sailor can use a
[2:07:53] headwind to carry him forward by tacking
[2:07:56] and taking advantage of its impelling
[2:07:58] force
[2:07:59] so it is possible for us in our
[2:08:01] spiritual life through the victorious
[2:08:03] grace of god to turn to account the
[2:08:06] things that seem most unfriendly and una
[2:08:09] unfavorable and to be able to say
[2:08:12] continually the things that were against
[2:08:14] me have happened to the furtherance of
[2:08:16] the gospel
[2:08:19] listen it goes just a little bit further
[2:08:20] it says a noted scientist observing that
[2:08:22] early voyagers fancied that the coral
[2:08:26] building animals instinctively build up
[2:08:28] the great circles of the atal islands to
[2:08:30] afford themselves protection in the
[2:08:32] inner parts has disproved this fancy by
[2:08:35] showing that the insect builders can
[2:08:38] only live and thrive fronting the open
[2:08:40] ocean and the highly aerated foam of its
[2:08:44] resistance resistive billows
[2:08:47] so it has been commonly thought that
[2:08:48] protected ease
[2:08:50] is the most favorable condition of life
[2:08:53] whereas all the noblest and strongest
[2:08:55] lives prove on the contrary that the
[2:08:58] endurance of hardship is the making of
[2:09:02] the men and the factor that
[2:09:04] distinguishes between existence
[2:09:06] and vigorous vitality in other words the
[2:09:10] difference between just existing and
[2:09:12] thriving and i believe god wants us to
[2:09:14] thrive
[2:09:17] he says hardship
[2:09:19] makes
[2:09:20] character
[2:09:22] second corinthians 2 14 now thanks be
[2:09:25] unto god who always leads us forth the
[2:09:27] triumph with the anointed one it's so
[2:09:29] amazing is what i just the lord i heard
[2:09:31] brother diggs begin to speak and he got
[2:09:33] this david at ziklag
[2:09:35] and david goes and it's incredible
[2:09:37] because if you read that entire story
[2:09:40] he loses everything god says go and
[2:09:42] you'll recover all david pursues and he
[2:09:44] goes and recovers all whips the
[2:09:46] philistines they get all their wives all
[2:09:49] their children and they get everything
[2:09:51] back they that the devil had taken from
[2:09:54] them but they're not just gonna get what
[2:09:56] the devil took but the bible says david
[2:09:58] also took all their treasure
[2:10:00] all their money all their goods and what
[2:10:02] were they they were spoils of war so
[2:10:05] when the bible says you're more than a
[2:10:07] conqueror because god will send you
[2:10:09] through difficulty and when you come out
[2:10:11] of that difficulty you won't just have
[2:10:13] what you lost through the trial but
[2:10:15] you'll have more than you started with
[2:10:18] oh you ought to give god a praise
[2:10:19] offering this morning
[2:10:21] say lord
